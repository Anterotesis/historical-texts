<HEAD>Introduction.</HEAD>
<P>THere are <HI>Three</HI> most undoing Mis|chiefs, which Threaten my Coun|trey with Grievous Confusions, yea, there are <HI>Four</HI> Evils that have a dire Aspect upon us, boding of something like Barbarism, and Extinction, unless the plentiful Effusions of the <HI>Good Spirit</HI> from on High, relieve the Inconveniencies of our <HI>Wilderness.</HI> The first is, The Neglect and Contempt of a well-form'd <HI>Education,</HI> appear|ing in a backwardness to Encourage Schools of Learning; and a Disposition unto a way of Living so scattered, as that it may be called, <HI>A Running wild into the Woods.</HI> The second is, The slothful, careless, quarrelsome Delay of <HI>Destitute Churches,</HI> to furnish them|selves with Officers appointed by the Lord Jesus Christ, for their Edification; by which Omission, Plantations quickly become full, either of, <HI>Sinners pining away in their Iniqui|ties,</HI> or of, <HI>Christians plagu'd with Leanness sent into their Soul.</HI> The Third is, the <HI>Crime</HI> of <HI>Ingratitude</HI> unto <HI>Publick Servants</HI>; and

the making of Censure, Slander and Hatred, the <HI>Common P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"></HI> of such as with most <HI>In<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">|olate Integrity,</HI> seek the <HI>Common Good</HI>: which <HI>Unthankfulness,</HI> will at last make our <HI>Times Perillous,</HI> because it will render us <HI>Friendless</HI> and <HI>Helpless.</HI> But the <HI>Fourth,</HI> and <HI>worst</HI> of all, is the lamentable want of REGENE|RATION in the <HI>Rising Generation.</HI> The God of Heaven is with no less Terrible than Evident Blows, from Heaven, Rebu|king of that <HI>Generation</HI>; but alas, how few of them do seriously consider on the Con|dition of their own <HI>Souls</HI>!

How few of them do become experimentally Acquainted with that <HI>Faith,</HI> and <HI>Repentance,</HI> and <HI>Holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord</HI>! It is indeed a matter of Exceeding <HI>Joy,</HI> that there are, <HI>so many</HI> of our Young Ones, that have their Faces Zion ward; but it is of all <HI>Grie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"></HI> the mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t bitter and pungent, that there are, <HI>No more.</HI> The obtaining of a Cure for <HI>this</HI> wre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">chedness would be to Re|dress all <HI>the rest,</HI> and it would contribute more than any <HI>One Thing</HI> whatever, to, <HI>All Things Going Well.</HI> Now there are Two Things, for which I take the Boldness, to Publish my <HI>Wishes,</HI> in order thereunto. The <HI>One</HI> is, That all our Congregations would <HI>oftner</HI>
<PB REF="000654_0004_0FA99EB8AFBB0E20">
do what <HI>some</HI> of them have <HI>sometimes</HI> done, in setting apart whole <HI>Dayes</HI> for Fasting and Prayer before the Lord, that his Pow|erful <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> may multiply sincere and tho|rough Conversions in the <HI>Rising Generation.</HI> The <HI>Other</HI> is, That the most Faithful, and Pious <HI>Ministers</HI> of the Gospel wherewith our God has blessed us, would, as He shall give them Opportunity, personally visit all the Families in their Flocks; and in those Visits, most affectionately Address the <HI>Rising Generation,</HI> upon the Nature and Necessity of that <HI>Conversion,</HI> which in their Publick Mi|nistry is press'd upon them.</P>
<P>'Tis in the pursuance of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">is</HI> Design, that I have here printed the Notes of two or three Sermons upon <HI>Regeneration,</HI> Preached almost <HI>seven</HI> years ago; accompany'd with two or three more since Delivered: hoping that the <HI>Young,</HI> may give a particular Attention to <HI>One</HI> who so belonged unto their <HI>Gene|ration.</HI> I make not a large Impression to ask <HI>Readers,</HI> abroad in the World: I have already done <HI>enough,</HI> and it may be too much of that; but I was willing to be furnished at least with so many Copies, as might serve me, with Gods permission, to Leave one in <HI>every House</HI> of the Dear People, whom He has commanded me to treat about, <HI>The Things of their Eternal Peace.</HI> Briefly, The Book is <HI>Printed,</HI> but I can

hardly say, 'tis <HI>published.</HI> Doubtless the World Rings, with the Noise of a strange Descent, which the <HI>Devils</HI> have lately made upon several parts of this Land, wherein those <HI>Evil Spirits,</HI> have horribly Tortured, Wounded, Scalded, and with a Thousand sensible and exquisite Cruelties, been trying to Dragoon our poor people, into their Services; which those <HI>Filthy Spectres</HI> pro|pound, with laying before them the Shape of a BOOK to be by them Entertained. Now, among the Engines to oppose the <HI>Devils</HI> Interests, there is also no little use to be made of, BOOKS; first, that <HI>Book of Books,</HI> the BIBLE; and then such other <HI>Books,</HI> as are to Explain the <HI>Lively Oracles</HI> of <HI>That.</HI> Among those <HI>Books,</HI> I have here endeavoured ONE more; whereof I would only say thus much; <HI>Reader,</HI> if thou canst ever be concerned about a more Impor|tant Subject than what is here handled, I am content, that THIS BOOK should never come into thy Hand: But if it come into thy <HI>Hand,</HI> Let the Desires of an Awa|kened Soul accompany it, that it may come <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">thy <HI>Heart</HI>; and that both our Names may be Written in the <HI>Lambs Book of Life.</HI></P>

<P>That we may Think distinctly, let this be,</P>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="proposition">
<HEAD>The First PROPOSITION.</HEAD>
<P>There is a REGENERATION, or <HI>New Birth,</HI> which the Elect of God, before their <HI>Death,</HI> must have Experience of. This is one of the Links, in that which has of old been called, <HI>The Golden Chain of Salvation; Rom.</HI> 8.30. <HI>Whom He did Predestinate, them He also Called</HI>; that is, he makes them Effectually to hear- that <HI>voice</HI> of his, whereby they are <HI>Born A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">gain. Predestination</HI> and <HI>Regeneration</HI> are the things which <HI>God hath Joyned:</HI> it will be to the mans own Everlasting Ruine if any man go to <HI>Put them asunder.</HI> We may be sure that, <HI>As many as are Ordained to Eternal Life,</HI> will by a <HI>Spiritual Birth</HI> be made capable for the Fru|ition of it. But what means that? <HI>How can a man be Born when He is Old?</HI></P>
<P>I Confess that as in <HI>Glorification,</HI> so in <HI>Re|generation,</HI>
<PB N="7" REF="000654_0012_0FA99EC02B41F598">
there are, <HI>Unutterable Things</HI>: 'tis Consisting of, and Surrounded with <HI>Invisi|bles.</HI> That Unaccountable Thing which is in <HI>Regeneration</HI> bestow'd upon us, is called, in 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 3.4. <HI>The Hidden Man of the Heart.</HI> What the Wise man says, about <HI>Generation,</HI> may be said about <HI>Regeneration</HI> too, <HI>We know not the way of the Spirit in us</HI>! Concerning <HI>both,</HI> it was the Language of the Psalmist, and it may be ours, <HI>We are fearfully and won|derfully made</HI>! Rude Pagans, 'tis true, have had their dark Notion, about, a, <HI>Renascentia,</HI> or a <HI>New-Birth,</HI> in their Philosophy: but how short were their Conceptions as to the <HI>Regeneration,</HI> and the <HI>New-Birth</HI> in Christiani|ty? That may be said of the <HI>New-Birth,</HI> which has been said of the <HI>New Name,</HI> in Rev. 2.17. <HI>No man knows it, except he that Receiveth it.</HI> And yet it is hard, even for such a man to <HI>Say,</HI> what he does <HI>Know</HI> about, such a <HI>marvellous work of God.</HI> However, Let this be offered as a small Description of it. REGENERATION, <HI>is a Real and Tho|rough Change, wrought by the Holy Spirit, in a Fallen Man, through the Infusion of a Gracious Principle into him, which Restores in him, the Lost Image of God, and therewithal Inclines him to comply with the Calls of the Gospel.</HI></P>
<P>Behold, what Conclusions we are to make.</P>
<P N="1">I. There is a <HI>Real</HI> &amp; a <HI>Thorough</HI> CHANGE
<PB N="8" REF="000654_0013_0FA99EC0EE0612F0">
wrought in every <HI>Regenerate</HI> Man. Indeed the <HI>Substance</HI> of one Soul is not Removed or Dissolved in <HI>Regeneration,</HI> and the <HI>Substance</HI> of an other Introduced, as the Jews fondly fancy'd. The <HI>Being</HI> of our Soul is not scat|tered, but the <HI>Crookedness</HI> and <HI>Wickedness</HI> there|of is Rectify'd, in <HI>Regeneration</HI>; the Metal of the Soul re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ns <HI>Old</HI> for the <HI>Sort</HI> of it, but becomes <HI>New</HI> for the <HI>Stamp</HI> of it; nor is a <HI>New Faculty</HI> added unto the Soul, but a <HI>New Quality</HI> unto the Faculty. Thus in <HI>Ezek.</HI> 36.26. a <HI>New Heart,</HI> and a <HI>New Spirit,</HI> is as|cribed unto the <HI>New-born</HI> Man; but how? As we Read of <HI>New Tongues,</HI> and <HI>New M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ons,</HI> which mean only a <HI>New Speech,</HI> and a <HI>Ne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Light</HI> ado<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ning of the old: But yet, a Mighty <HI>Cha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ge</HI> is undergone by the <HI>Regene|rate</HI> Man; he is <HI>born again,</HI> that is, he is one come into another world, and has ano|ther way of Living in that world, than before; he is, as we find him called, in Eph. 4.23. <HI>A Renewed Man.</HI></P>
<P>First, It is a REAL <HI>Change,</HI> that the <HI>Re|generate Man</HI> has pass'd upon him. 'Tis not meerly a <HI>Relative</HI> Change; and so the Change in <HI>Regeneration</HI> differs from that in <HI>Justificati|on.</HI> In one there is a Change of <HI>Estate,</HI> in t'other a change of <HI>Temper.</HI> In <HI>that,</HI> the <HI>Guilt</HI> of Sin is Blotted out; in <HI>this,</HI> the the <HI>Filth</HI> of Sin is wash'd away. <HI>That</HI> is a <HI>Sentence</HI> on the Sinner; like that in 2 Sam.
<PB N="9" REF="000654_0014_0FA99EC32965DAC8">
12.13. <HI>The Lord hath put away thy sin, thou shalt not dy. This</HI> is a <HI>Filling</HI> of the Sinner; as we may read, Eph. 2.1. <HI>You hath he filled, who were Dead in Trespasses and Sins.</HI> Nor is it meerly a <HI>Nominal</HI> or a <HI>Notional</HI> Change: 'tis no Brain-sick Imagination. We have one picture of this Change drawn from <HI>Inanimate</HI> Things; in Isa. 55.13. <HI>Instead of the Thorn, shall come up the Fir tree, and instead of the Briar, shall come up the Myrtle-tree.</HI> We have another shadow of this Change, fetch'd from <HI>Animate</HI> Things; in Isa. 11.6. <HI>The Wolf shall dwell with the Lamb, and the Leopard shall lye down with the Kid.</HI> In <HI>Re|generation</HI> thus it is; the man varies from what once he was, as much as a <HI>Fir</HI> from a <HI>Thorn,</HI> as much as a <HI>Lamb</HI> from a <HI>Wolf</HI>! Thus, One of the Primitive Christians, after his Conver|sion, being met by an Idolater of his old Acquaintance, had that Salutation from him, <HI>Ego Sum,</HI> Sir, 'tis <HI>I</HI>? whereupon he Re|ply'd, <HI>At Ego non sum Ego</HI>; But Sir, <HI>'Tis not I</HI>; I am not the man I was. We may therefore add,</P>
<P>Secondly, It is a THOROUGH <HI>Change</HI> that passes upon the <HI>Regenerate</HI> Man. <HI>Of</HI> and <HI>by</HI> such a man, 'tis said in 2 Cor. 5.17. <HI>Old things are past away, behold, all things are become New</HI>; as the <HI>Conflagration</HI> at th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Last Day, will bring a New Face upon the <HI>Great World</HI>; so does a <HI>Regeneration</HI> at this

Regenerate man, opposed unto the <HI>Old man,</HI> that is, the old Habit of Sin, and Vice, which he was Born withal.

become <HI>Natural,</HI> or Free, Fre|quent, Fervent and constant with him that has it.

<P N="3">III.

For this cause we are informed in Col. 3.10. <HI>The New Man is Renewed after the Image of Him which Created it.</HI> In this Lay the Primitive Happiness of man at his Creation; 'tis the Account, which, <HI>In the Head of Gods Book,</HI> is given of it, <HI>God Created Man in his own Image.</HI> But what was that <HI>Image</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">f God?

him. As a man that is bitten by a <HI>Mad Dog,</HI> horribly <HI>Barks,</HI> and Howls, and Laps, just like the Creature which Enven|om'd him; so has the Infection convey'd unto us, by the Breath and Sting of our Tempter, <HI>The Great Red Old Dragon,</HI> fear|fu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ly assimilated us unto himself. But now <HI>Regeneration</HI> happily Recovers in us, the thus Impaired <HI>Image</HI> of God; by defacing the Impressions of Hell that had been made upon us. There is a marvellous <HI>A|greement</HI> now between God and Man; wherein though not the <HI>Essence,</HI> nor the <HI>Greatness</HI> of God, yet a Resemblance of His HOLINESS is in a blessed measure Communicated unto the man thus, <HI>Born again.</HI> It may be said of him, <HI>He is a man after Gods own Heart</HI>; he <HI>Likes,</HI> he <HI>Loves,</HI> he <HI>Lives</HI> after such a manner as to de|scribe unto all serious Beholders, a little of that <HI>Holiness,</HI> which is Infinite in the <HI>Holy One of Israel.</HI> Hence, a Regenerate man studies a most exact Conformity to the Example of the Lord Jesus Christ, and Attains very much of what he studies. As a Renowned Minister could say, <HI>When I am to Preach a Sermon,</HI> I <HI>set my self to think, How would Jesus Christ Preach, were He to Handle my Subject</HI>! So a Regenerate man sometimes thinks, <HI>How did the Blessed Jesus do such a Duty?</HI> or, <HI>How did the bles|sed

Jesus bear such a Trial</HI>? and then he endeavours to go <HI>and do Likewise.</HI> A Re|generate man, is a CHRISTIAN in reality; that is, <HI>A Christ-like man</HI>; and it may be said of such ones, <HI>As thou art, so are they&punc; each one Resembling the Children of a King.</HI> What shall I say? The view of the Imi|table Vertue and Carriage in our Lord Jesus, even <HI>Transforms</HI> the Regenerate man, till he be, <HI>Changed into the same Image from Glory to Glory.</HI> Unto this we will annex but one Conclusion more: and O that you might <HI>Feel,</HI> what you are now to <HI>Hear.</HI></P>
<P N="4">IV. The Gracious <HI>Principle,</HI> which Re|stores the <HI>Image</HI> of God, in a <HI>Regenerate</HI> man, inclines him to comply with the CALLS of God, in the GOSPEL. Unto all the Evangelical Proposals, the Return of the Regenerate man is not that, <HI>As for the Word spoken in the Name of the Lord,</HI> I <HI>will not hearken thereunto</HI>; no, but it is that, <HI>Lo,</HI> I <HI>come,</HI> I <HI>delight to do thy Will, O my God.</HI> There are especially two things wherein the Calls of the Gospel are sum|med up unto us; namely, those two, in Acts 20.21. <HI>Repentance towards God, and Faith towards our Lord Jesus Christ</HI>: but the Regenerate have the <HI>Repentance,</HI> and the <HI>Faith,</HI> so called for. Such is the REPEN|TANCE
<PB N="20" REF="000654_0025_0FA99ECAAD633788">
of a Regenerate man; that he looks on his manifold sinfulness both by <HI>Nature</HI> and <HI>Practice,</HI> with a thorough <HI>Con|viction</HI> of it; and he cries out, <HI>Lord,</HI> I <HI>am vile</HI>: He then mourns for that exceeding sinfulness, and Loathes himself with the <HI>Contrition,</HI> of a <HI>Rent,</HI> a <HI>Pierc'd,</HI> a <HI>Broken Heart,</HI> within him. He therewithal comes to an Ingenuous <HI>Confession</HI> thereof; and Sin becomes as a <HI>Cup of Trembling,</HI> or Poison in his Bowels, which he does <HI>Cast up,</HI> with penitent Acknowledgments, before such as have seen <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">im <HI>take in</HI> the Deadly Poyson.

<P><PB N="25" REF="000654_0030_0FA99ECFF8AC9F08">Know therefore, that it means, <HI>The Blessed state, whereinto God brings his chosen by the Lord Jesus Christ.</HI></P>
<P>A state wherein God Himself is the <HI>King</HI> of His people, and wherein the People of God, will as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, have a Dominion over all their Interiour adversaries.

<P N="1">I. Without <HI>Regeneration</HI> a man cannot en|joy a GOSPEL-ESTATE in this world.

<HI>Good</HI> in the State. There may be Traitors in the Kingdome, and <HI>Ishmaels</HI> and <HI>Judases</HI> in the Families, of the Church; but unto what purpose? It cannot be said of them, <HI>They have seen the Kingdome of God come with power,</HI> all this while. Unregenerate Soul, Hear thy Circumstances, and be A|mazed!</P>
<P>First, <HI>Gospel Mysteries,</HI> cannot be Discern|ed by an Ungenerate Man. He is, <HI>Born Blind,</HI> and so he continues, till the <HI>New-birth</HI> has once Enlightened him. There are <HI>Thick scales</HI> upon the Eyes, which <HI>Regene|ration</HI> has not opened. The <HI>Methods</HI> and <HI>Rewards</HI> used by God, in Governing of the <HI>Unseen World,</HI> are most of all <HI>Unseen</HI> by the Unregenerate: It is said, in 1 Cor. 2.14. <HI>The Natural man cannot know them, because they are Spiritually Discerned.</HI> Without Rege|neration a man cannot come to understand, <HI>How man is to be Saved,</HI> or, <HI>How God is to be Served,</HI> or, <HI>How things depend upon one another, in the Great Mystery of Godliness.</HI> 'Tis with him, as in Luc. 14.34. <HI>The Eye is Evil, and the Body is full of Darkness!</HI> and his Conceptions about the Things of God, are like those which a Beggar in his Ho|vel, or an Indian his Wigwam, has about the Magnificence of a mighty Kingdom.

not in a Condition so deplorable<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"></P>
<P>Secondly, <HI>Gospel Services</HI> cannot be at|tended by an Unregenerate Man. We are told, <HI>That the Kingdom of God, is Righteous|ness, and Peace, and Joy in the Holy Ghost</HI>; but without <HI>Regeneration</HI> there is no Attain|ing of them. There is a certain Homage which we are to pay unto our Great <HI>King</HI>; but the Unregenerate Man being of, <HI>The Bruitish among the People,</HI> does labour under an utter and a mortal Incapacit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to render that, <HI>Reasonable Service.</HI> Thus 'tis said, in <HI>Rom.</HI> 8.8. <HI>They that are in the Flesh cannot please God.</HI> The man is told, and warn'd, and charg'd from time to time about, <HI>The Thing that Good is</HI>; but he can Do nothing! He can yield unto God, no Worship that is Right for the <HI>Matter</HI>&punc; the <HI>Manner,</HI> and the <HI>Motive</HI> of it. He cannot Serve God <HI>Spiritually</HI>&punc; for he is all <HI>Flesh</HI>; and his very <HI>Soul</HI> within him, is as One of the Ancients has it, after a sort <HI>Incarnated:</HI> he may too truly say, <HI>The Law is Spiritual, but</HI> I <HI>am carnal, sold under Sin</HI>! When he pretends to wait upon God, it is with an Application of his whole Soul: every Sacrifice that he brings has the Ill Omen of being, <HI>without an Heart</HI>; he may say, <HI>I Lift up my Eyes, my Hands, my Voice!</HI> but he cannot say with the Psalmist, <HI>Lord, I Lift my Soul unto thee</HI>; nor, <HI>Serve the Lord, O my Soul, and all that is within me</HI>!
<PB N="30" REF="000654_0033_0FA99ED22F04D998">
Nor can he Serve God <HI>Sincerely</HI>; for he was conceived with what i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> contrary to, <HI>Tr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">th in the Inward Parts</HI>; and it is nothing but <HI>Fear</HI> of some Temporal Inconvenience, or <HI>Pride</HI> of being Applauded among men, that makes him do what he does. 'Tis on|ly <HI>Self,</HI> that Clay<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ol, <HI>Self,</HI> which puts this <HI>Pharisee</HI> upon Shows of <HI>Piety</HI> or <HI>Charity</HI>; and <HI>God</HI> is not before him. It was said, in <HI>Joh.</HI> 4.24. <HI>They that Worship God must Worship him in Spirit and in Truth.</HI> But what a <HI>vain Worship</HI> then, is that of the Unrege|nerate! Useless Wretch, what is he good for?</P>
<P>Thirdly, <HI>Gospel Priviledges</HI> may not be ex|pected by a man that is Unregenerate. What the Psalmist said about the <HI>City,</HI> we may say about the <HI>Kingdom,</HI> of God, <HI>Glorious Things are spoken of thee</HI>! But until by Re|generation Men are Naturalized, in this <HI>Kingdom,</HI> they cannot lay claim to those <HI>Glo|rious Things. 'Tis Regeneration</HI> that helps us to that <HI>Wedding Garment,</HI> without which, if we come to the Gospel Table, the Great <HI>King</HI> will say unto us, <HI>How camest thou hither</HI>?</P>
<P>But particularly, The Unregenerate Man can have no <HI>Union</HI> with the Lord Jesus Christ: No, He is yet in the <HI>First Adam.</HI> A man cannot be United unto the <HI>Heavenly Adam,</HI> without the <HI>Heavenly Image.</HI> 'Tis in Regeneration, that we come to be Grafted

That, there is all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Style that belongs to Wretched Unrege|nerates.</P>
<P>Once more, Thirdly, those <HI>Holy Things,</HI> the <HI>Sealing Ordinances</HI> of the Lord Jesus Christ, belong not unto an unregenerate man. There is a <HI>Seal</HI> but unto a blank, if we ad|minister
<PB N="34" REF="000654_0037_0FA99ED531C18898">
those <HI>Seals</HI> unto such as have no <HI>Re|generation</HI> in them. A man must be visibly <HI>Regenerate</HI> before he may lawfully claim the <HI>Baptism</HI> of the Lord, for himself and his house. There is as well <HI>Purgation</HI> of Soul, as <HI>Remission</HI> of Sin, Sealed in that Ordinance: which who has but the <HI>Regenerate</HI>! It was of Old required, <HI>Repent and be Baptised:</HI> It was again required, <HI>If thou believest with all thine heart, then mayest be Baptised</HI>; Now who do's that, but the <HI>Regenerate</HI> of the Lord?

How unlikely will the Soveraign God also be, to bestow <HI>Regeneration</HI> upon those who do not own that <HI>Soveraignty,</HI> or do not feel that we are, <HI>Saved by Grace, thro' Faith; and this not of our selves, 'tis the Gift of God</HI>? Indeed, the Natural and Essential <HI>Freedome of our Will,</HI> remains unto us; it wills <HI>freely,</HI> wherever it <HI>Wills</HI> at all: but alas, 'tis no better than, <HI>Free among the Dead:</HI> only <HI>Dead Works</HI> are grateful to the Will of the Unregenerate: his <HI>Will,</HI> as well as the rest of his whole Soul, is corrupted in him.

<P>Particularly;</P>
<P>First, Can you not avoid the <HI>Society</HI> of those, by whom your own <HI>Regeneration</HI> may be discouraged! O then avoid it. What should hinder you that you should not be able to say, as in Psal. 26.3. <HI>I have not sat with vain person<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI>! There are ungodly ones that would prejudice your hearts against the pow|er of Godliness, and that would entangle you in the snares of sin and hell: concer|ning those let me vehemently cry unto you in words like those of <HI>Moses, Depart I pray you, from these wicked ones, Lest you pe|rish with them.</HI> O that you may be deter'd from the <HI>Fascinations</HI> of evil company, by that admonition of wisdome, in Prov. 13.20. <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">panion of fools shall be destroyed.</HI> If you see a Person profane, vitious, extrava|gant, I say, <HI>My Son if that sinner entice thee

consent thou not</HI>; shun him, fly him, he may be the cut-throat of thy Soul. Tell him, you cannot walk with him; except hee'll take, <HI>The way that is called holy.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, Can you not present some kind of <HI>Supplication</HI> before the Lord, for your own <HI>Regeneration</HI>? O then present it. There was a man, to whom, altho' it had been said, <HI>Thy Heart is not Right,</HI> yet there was that Advice given, in <HI>Acts</HI> 8.22. <HI>Pray to God</HI>! If the Life of your Bodies lay at stake, would you not be in Earnest for Delive|rance? Behold, O Dying Sinner, Thy SOUL, Thy Soul is in the very <HI>Belly</HI> of <HI>Hell</HI>; and why then dost thou not like the Psalmist, <HI>Call upon the Name of the Lord, and say, I bese<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ch thee to Deliver my Soul</HI>!

<P>Thirdly, Can you not Attend the Mini|stry of that <HI>Word</HI> whereby <HI>Regeneration</HI> is Effected? O then Attend it. It is said, in 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 1.23. We are, <HI>Born again by the Word of God, which Liveth and Abideth for ever.</HI> Wherefore, place your selves as much as you can, under the Dispensations of that New Creating <HI>Word!</HI> Were you daily con|versing with the <HI>Word</HI> of God, you would therein <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ie at the <HI>Pool,</HI> in the <HI>House of Mercy</HI>: who knows, but God may there meet you, with a Cure of all your Ma|ladies?

O be continually waiting, upon Wisdoms <HI>Lively Oracles,</HI> that so you may, <HI>Hear and Live</HI>! Said the Apostle, in 1 Cor. 4.15. <HI>In Christ Jesus, I have Begotten you, thro' the Gospel:</HI> so then, if the <HI>Gospel</HI> were always in your Eyes or Ears, 'tis Likely that you might be, <HI>Begot|ten of Christ Jesus.</HI> The Breath of <HI>Satan</HI> was that which did corrupt you, and the

Breath of <HI>Jesus</HI> may now Amend you. 'Tis said, <HI>Where the word of a King is, there is Power:</HI> If then, you seriously set your selves before and under the <HI>Word</HI> of the Eternal <HI>King,</HI> it may have such a <HI>power</HI> on you, as to bring you home unto God.

<P>Fourthly, You can CONSIDER; and Oh that you would! It is said, in Ezek. 18.28. <HI>Because he Considers, and he Turns, he shall surely Live.</HI> It seems that <HI>Conside|ration</HI> is the frequent Introduction of <HI>Re|generation:</HI> A Prodigal will be likely to <HI>Come unto a Right Mind,</HI> if once he begin to <HI>Bethink himself.</HI> We have been told of a wicked young man, who being obliged by his Dying Father, to spend a quarter of an Hour every Day, only in <HI>Consider|ing,</HI> even on any thing, what he pleased; at length he began to <HI>Consider,</HI> what might be the Cause of his Fathers giving him such a Charge: <HI>This</HI> fill'd him with <HI>serious

A SOUL, certainly 'tis well worth all that can be done for it.

<HEAD>GOOD COUNSEL In Answer to the GREAT QUESTION; What shall I do to be Saved?</HEAD>

<P>BEhold, the Gracious and Glorious <HI>Invi|tation</HI> of the Gospel here set before us: There are various and many <HI>Questions,</HI> about which the minds of men are most sollicitously agitated; but there is no <HI>Question</HI> of more Importance to be consi|dered by them, than that, <HI>What shall</HI> I <HI>do to be Saved</HI>? In Answer to that Inquiry, there is, <HI>The One Thing Needful,</HI> recommended unto us, in 1 Joh. 3.23. <HI>This is Gods Commandment, that we should Believe <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n the Name of his Son Jesus Christ.</HI> Now to Encourage our Obedi|ence
<PB N="74" REF="000654_0077_0FA99F3EF4FDEEE8">
unto that <HI>Commandment</HI> of God, we have here a most compassionate <HI>Invitation</HI> of our Lord Jesus Christ Himself; where|in, by, <HI>Coming to Him,</HI> He means nothing more nor less than, <HI>Believing on his Name.</HI> The <HI>Feast of Tabernacles</HI> held in <HI>September,</HI> with an Anniversary Observation among the ancient Jews, Typically Represented the Incarnation of our Lord Jesus Christ, who, probably at that very time of the Year, first came to <HI>Tabernacle in Flesh</HI> among us. Our Blessed Lord Jesus Christ, the <HI>An|titype</HI> of that Feast, we now find present at it; and inasmuch as the Day after the <HI>Seventh,</HI> darkly pointing at our Christian Sabbath, was the <HI>Last</HI> and <HI>Great</HI> Day of those Eight, wherein they Celebrated that <HI>Festivity,</HI> our Lord then made a most use|ful Sermon to a Thronged Auditory. Our Text informs us, <HI>First,</HI> What He <HI>Did.</HI> He <HI>Stood</HI>; that was that He might be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">&punc; He <HI>Cry'd</HI>; that was that He might be <HI>Heard.</HI> And <HI>then,</HI> what He <HI>Said.</HI> That was, <HI>If any man Thirst, Let Him come to me, and Drink.</HI> It was an usual Rite, a|mong the Jews at that Solemnity, to fetch Water from <HI>Siloam,</HI> and pour it out before the Lord, using the words of the Prophet, in Isa. 12.3. <HI>With Joy shall ye Draw Water out of the Wells of Salvation.</HI> Perhaps these Words of our Lord may be on Occasion
<PB N="75" REF="000654_0078_0FA99F3FAC88A280">
thereof, and in Allusion thereto; and it may be as if our Lord had said, <HI>Would you know where the true Wells of Salvation are? 'Tis in me, that they are to be met withal: you must come to me for them.</HI> The Blessings which our Lord Jesus Christ has to bestow upon us, are here compared unto <HI>Water</HI>: and in his Inviting us there|unto, he seems to have some Eye unto the Form of Speaking, used by the Pro|phet of old, in <HI>Isa.</HI> 55.1. <HI>Ho every one that Thirsteth, come ye unto the Waters.</HI> But there is a most weighty <HI>Case</HI> which hence ari|ses to be considered; and that is,</P>
<P>&para; After what manner ought we to enter|tain the Invitations which the Lord Je|sus Christ in the Gospel gives us to come unto Him?</P>
<P>I would now pray my Hearers, to <HI>Set their Hearts,</HI> unto the Things which I am going to speak; they are not <HI>Vain,</HI> or Light and Small Things; your <HI>Lives,</HI> yea, the <HI>Lives</HI> of your Never-Dying Souls, are as deeply concerned in these things, as in any that you were Ever Treated with.</P>
<P N="1">I. There is a <HI>Thirsty,</HI> that is, a Distrest Condition of Soul, whereinto the Children of Men are brought, before they will come
<PB N="76" REF="000654_0079_0FA99F406E47BF70">
unto the Lord Jesus Christ. We shall ne|ver Comply with the Invitations of the <HI>Gos|pel</HI>; until our Hearts have by an Heart|breaking work of the Law upon them, first been prepared for it: now that work of the <HI>Law</HI> do's raise a Mighty, and a Scalding <HI>Thirst,</HI> in the Souls of them that feel it. When Our Lord was Dying for us, He Cry'd out, I <HI>Thirst</HI>! and that must be our Cry, when we are Coming to Our Lord for the Good Effects of His Death. Saies Our Lord, <HI>If any man Thirst, Let him Come un|to Me,</HI> not because any Praeparatory <HI>Thirst,</HI> may entitle us unto the use of a Saviour; but b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cause without such a <HI>Thirst,</HI> it is Ordi|narily and Naturally impossible, that we should care for Our Saviour. All of us <HI>may</HI> come unto the Lord Jesus Christ; but we ne|ver <HI>shall,</HI> yea, we never <HI>can,</HI> come, till we have <HI>Thirsty</HI> Souls within us. The <HI>Waters of Life,</HI> will not be welcome to us, till we are like <HI>Sampson</HI> or <HI>Hagar,</HI> even Dying in <HI>Thirsty</HI> Anguishes. As the best <HI>Honey,</HI> so the best <HI>Water,</HI> is Loathed by the <HI>full Soul.</HI> Until we are <HI>Dry</HI> by the parchings of Guilt and Grief within us, we shall be <HI>Deaf</HI> to all the proposals of the Lord Jesus Christ. While men have not their Hearts Broken, Amazed, and Abased, by <HI>Convictions,</HI> from the <HI>Spirit</HI> of God becoming a <HI>Spirit of Bondage</HI> unto
<PB N="77" REF="000654_0080_0FA99F413345FA00">
them, our Lord says, as in <HI>Joh.</HI> 5.44. <HI>How can you Believe?</HI> When our Lord Invites us to <HI>Come</HI> unto Him, He supposes that the Wrath of God has given a dreadful Inflam|mation unto our Souls; that we have seen the Eternal God Angry with us, and the E|verlasting <HI>Fire</HI> of His Indignation in the Fiery Vault below ready to fly up and break out upon us; that our Souls have been as it were set on a Light <HI>Fire,</HI> with hideous Apprehensions of the Sins which Ly upon us, and of the Wants and Woes which we are exposed unto. Except men are thus <HI>Awakened,</HI> they will for ever sleight all over|tures about coming to the Lord Jesus Christ; they will say, <HI>There is no Beauty in him, for which he should be desired</HI>! Until we are thus disturbed in that <HI>Rest</HI> which we had in our corrupt estate under the first <HI>Adam,</HI> we shall never take one good step towards the Second. Well then,</P>
<P>'Tis requisite, <HI>First,</HI> that we become sensi|ble of our <HI>Emptiness,</HI> as to our <HI>Happiness.</HI> We are to have an Exquisite and a Trou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">blesome sense of this, that we are <HI>Ungodly and without Strength</HI>; that we are, <HI>Dead in trespasses and sins</HI>; that we are, <HI>Wretched and Poor, and Miserable, and Blind, and Naked.</HI> As he cryed out, in Rom. 7.17, <HI>In me there dwells no Good thing.</HI> So are we to complain, <HI>In me there is no Light</HI>!
<PB N="78" REF="000654_0081_0FA99F4243311BB0">
and, <HI>In me there is no Life</HI>! and, <HI>There is nothing in me but an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Hell upon Earth</HI>! The Veins of our Souls&punc; are to Suck and Pull and Prick within us, thro' the per|ceived Absence of all <HI>Spiritual Good</HI>; they are pungent and painful resentments, of our destitute circumstances, wherewith we should say, as in Psal. 119.81. <HI>Lord, my Soul fainteth for thy Salvation.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis requisite, <HI>Next,</HI> that we become Im|patient of our <HI>Misery</HI> by our <HI>Emptiness.</HI> We are to count that our being without the <HI>Know|ledge,</HI> and without the <HI>Image,</HI> and without the <HI>Favour</HI> of God, <HI>is An intolerable thing.</HI> As the people could not bear it, when there happened unto them, that mischief, in Exod. 17.3. <HI>The People thirsted for water.</HI> So, when we think on the Calamities of our Souls, we should be able to say, <HI>Lord, I find my self not Able to Bear these Calami|ties.</HI> We are to be <HI>Filled</HI> with Bitter and Grievous Anxieties, when we think how <HI>Empty</HI> we are, of all manner of Good; and we are with <HI>pierced Hearts,</HI> to make that Out|cry in Act. 2.37. <HI>What shall we do?</HI></P>
<P>But then, <HI>Thirdly,</HI> 'Tis requisite that we become Desirous of a <HI>Remedy</HI> for our <HI>Mi|sery.</HI> And since 'tis the Lord Jesus Christ alone, who says unto us, <HI>In me is thy He<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">p,</HI> 'tis after our Lord Jesus Christ, that ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Souls are to cry, with Raging Agonies.
<PB N="79" REF="000654_0082_0FA99F44389C0508">
The Christ-ward Inclinations of our Souls are to be those in Psal. 42.12. <HI>As the Hart panteth after the Water-brooks&punc; so panteth my Soul after thee, O God. My Soul thirsteth for God, for the Living God.</HI> We must be willing to Attend any Thing, to Fore go any Thing, to <HI>Deny</HI> our selves of any thing, which in our Closure with the Lord Jesus Christ is called for. What the <HI>Martyr</HI> in the Flames cry'd out, <HI>None but Christ, None but Christ! That</HI> must the <HI>Enflamed</HI> Soul of the <HI>Sinner</HI> cry, tho' all the Pleasures, and all the Riches, and all the Honours of this World should be set before him; <HI>A Christ! A Christ! for an Un|done Soul; or else I am Irrecoverably Undone!</HI> Never did the Drowning <HI>An<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ediluvians</HI> more wish for, <HI>An Ark</HI>! Never did a pursued Man-Slayer more wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h for, <HI>A Refuge City</HI>; Never did a poisoned Israelite more wish for, A <HI>Brazen Serpent</HI>; than we are to wish for the <HI>Sure Mercies</HI> of our Lord Jesus Christ. As <HI>David</HI> Longed, in 2 Sam. 23.15. <HI>Oh that one would give me to Drink of the Water of the Well of Bethlehem!</HI> So must we <HI>Long</HI> for all Union and a Fellowship, with that Messias, who was Born at <HI>Bethlehem</HI>; and say, <HI>O that I had a Christ, for the Satisfaction of a needy Soul.</HI></P>
<P>Until we have some such <HI>Preparations</HI> wrought in our Hearts, we shall certainly remain, <HI>Shut up in Unbelief</HI>; and our Lord
<PB N="80" REF="000654_0083_0FA99F44F4EE2BC0">
Jesus Christ will say of us, <HI>as</HI> in <HI>Joh.</HI> 5.40. <HI>Ye will not come unto me, that ye may have Life!</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. In Coming to our Lord Jesus Christ, we must seek and ask for the <HI>Whole</HI> of that <HI>Salvation,</HI> which He has to bestow upon us. It is no sinful <HI>Selfishness</HI> for us, to propound our own <HI>Salvation,</HI> in our Coming unto the Lord Jesus Christ; nor should we be dis|couraged about the <HI>Sincerity</HI> of our Coming, because we therein acted for our own <HI>Sal|vation.</HI> The <HI>Honour</HI> and <HI>Glory</HI> of God is en|wrap'd so in our <HI>Salvation,</HI> that we shall do amiss if we go to Separate them: I may say, <HI>What God has thus Joyned, Let no man put asunder!</HI> Yea, a man should not forbear Coming to the Lord Jesus Christ, altho' he can see nothing, but <HI>Self,</HI> stirring him thereunto; Let him come, tho' it be at first upon <HI>Meaner Ends; that</HI> will be the way for him to obtain an Impression of <HI>Nobler Ends</HI> upon him, when he shall come again. However, what is to be, <HI>The End of our Faith</HI>? 'tis to be, <HI>The Salvation of the Soul.</HI> Why then, Let us be sure therein to pro|pound unto our selves, the Enjoyment of ALL that <HI>Salvation.</HI> As it was of old said, <HI>Is Christ Divided</HI>? so we must make no <HI>Di|vision</HI> of that <HI>Salvation,</HI> for which the Lord Jesus Christ is to be Sued unto. Even the <HI>Murderers</HI> of our Lord, were averse unto
<PB N="81" REF="000654_0084_0FA99F45AF1ED5F0">
<HI>Dividing</HI> of his <HI>Garments</HI>; and <HI>Believers</HI> on our Lord are as averse unto the <HI>Dividing</HI> of His <HI>Mercies,</HI> Well then, Let us ponder with our selves, what a <HI>Priest,</HI> what a <HI>Pro|phet,</HI> what a <HI>King,</HI> our Lord-Redeemer is, and let us beseech Him, to Be such an One, and to <HI>Do</HI> all that is to be done by such an One for our Souls.</P>
<P>Particularly, <HI>Atonement,</HI> is one of those things which we are to come unto the Lord Jesus for. We are to come unto Him, as He is represented in Psal. 110.4. <HI>Thou art a Priest for ever!</HI> He demands of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>Art thou willing that I should be a Priest for thy Soul</HI>! and we must heartily consent un|to his being so; therewithal, saying like the Psalmist, in Psal. 119. 122. <HI>O be surety for thy servant for good.</HI> We must come unto Him, as unto, <HI>The Lamb of God, which takes away the sin of the world</HI>: Come un|to Him, as unto <HI>Him, That Loves us, and washes us from our sins in His own Blood</HI>; Come unto Him, as unto that Jesus who having made <HI>Satisfaction</HI> for us on the Cross, here below, goes up, and goes on, to make <HI>Intercession</HI> for us, at the Right Hand of God&punc; above. We must ask to enjoy such a JESUS in him! yea, and at the same time, we should be willing to pay the Dues of the <HI>High Priest</HI> unto him.</P>
<P>Again, <HI>Instruction</HI> is another of those things
<PB N="82" REF="000654_0085_0FA99F466D70C060">
which we are to come unto the Lord Je|sus for. We are to come unto Him, as He is exhibited in Acts 3.22. <HI>A Prophet shall the Lord Raise up unto you.</HI> He enquires of us, <HI>Art thou willing that I should be the Prophet of thy Soul</HI>! and we must sincere+ly consent unto His being that; saying with the Psalmist, in Psal. 25.4. <HI>Shew me thy Ways, O Lord; Teach me thy Paths.</HI> We must come unto Him, for that <HI>Eye salve</HI> whereof He hath said, <HI>I counsel thee to buy it of me</HI>! Come unto Him, as of old that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ind Son of <HI>Sorrow,</HI> crying, <HI>Lord! that I may recieve my sight!</HI> Come unto Him a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> a Scholar unto a Tutor, that He may show us, <HI>The Path of Life.</HI> So are we to Resign ourselves unto the conduct of Our Lord, that by his unerring <HI>Scripture,</HI> and <HI>Spirit,</HI> He may lead us <HI>in the Paths of Righteousness.</HI></P>
<P>Once more, Tis for <HI>Government,</HI> and <HI>Protection,</HI> that our Lord Jesus Christ must be come unto. We are to come unto him, as he is described <HI>Psal.</HI> 2.6. <HI>The King upon the Holy hill of Zion.</HI> He puts that on us, <HI>Art thou willing that I should be a King unto thee?</HI> and we should immediately submit unto him, as the <HI>King,</HI> the <HI>Lord,</HI> the <HI>Law-giver,</HI> that is to <HI>save</HI> us; there withal spreading <HI>That,</HI> as the wish of our Souls before Him, in Psal. 119.5. <HI>O that
<PB N="83" REF="000654_0086_0FA99F472C6F2710">
my ways were directed to keep thy Statutes!</HI> We must come unto him, that He would <HI>Bless us, by Turning us every one from our Iniquities</HI>; Come unto Him, that he would <HI>Sanctify us throughout in Spirit and Soul and Body, and preserve us Blameless to his Hea|venly Kingdome:</HI> Come unto him, that we may be Ruled by the <HI>Scepter of his Righte|ousness</HI>; and made <HI>Conquerors and more than Conquerors, over our Spiritual Adversa|ries.</HI> And thus, we are to take an <HI>Oath of Fidelity</HI> unto our Lord, Vowing that we will <HI>Fight</HI> under his <HI>Banners,</HI> and Begging that he would make us <HI>Faithful to the Death.</HI></P>
<P N="3"><HI>III.</HI> Coming to the Lord Jesus Christ, is a thing that calleth for the <HI>Whole Soul,</HI> and all proper motions of the Soul, to be engaged in it. As in Praising of God, it is the Rule, in <HI>Psal.</HI> 103.1. <HI>Bless the Lord O my Soul, and all that is within me, Praise his Holy Name</HI>; so in coming to Christ, the same Rule is to be observed; <HI>It must be done with the whole Soul, and all that is within us.</HI> The mind, the will, the Af|fections, and all the Powers of the Soul, are to be concerned in this <HI>Work of God.</HI> As now,</P>
<P>First, It is with a certain <HI>Perswasion</HI> of the Lord Jesus Christ, that we are to come unto him. When we come unto the Lord
<PB N="84" REF="000654_0087_0FA99F47ED66C1C8">
Jesus Christ, we must Firmly <HI>Believe</HI> all the Discoveries and Revelations, which God has given of him; and we should come to the Attainment of the Apostle, in 2. <HI>Tim</HI> 1 12. <HI>I know whom I have believed, and I am perswa+ded that He is able to keep that which I have committed unto Him.</HI> We are to be well perswaded of the Excellent Qualities i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> our Lord Jesus Christ, when we come <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nto <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">im, and we are to be more than <HI>Al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ost perswa|ded,</HI> that <HI>In Him there does all Fulness dwell.</HI> There are especially four perswasions which we are to Entertain, about our Lord Jesus Christ: or else we shall be <HI>Lame</HI> in our Coming unto Him. One is, <HI>That He is Able to Save unto the uttermost, all that Come unto God, by Him.</HI> A Second is, <HI>That there is none other Name under Heaven, given a|mong men, whereby we must be Saved.</HI> A Third is, <HI>That whosoever comes unto Him, He will in no wise Cast him out.</HI> A Fourth is, <HI>That he who Believeth, shall be Saved.</HI> All of these, must be Look'd upon as most <HI>Faithful Sayings</HI>; and we must be ready to venture all the Interests of our Immortal Souls upon them.</P>
<P>Secondly, It is with a fervent <HI>Petition</HI> to the Lord Jesus Christ, that we are to Come unto Him. The posture wherein we should come unto the Lord Jesus Christ, is upon our <HI>Knees:</HI> and we should present
<PB N="85" REF="000654_0088_0FA99F48ABC95DA8">
our prayers before him, as did the leper, in <HI>Marc.</HI> 1.40. <HI>He came to him, Beseeching Him, and kneeling down to him.</HI> Tis in the Qua|lity of <HI>Petitioners</HI>; yea, and of <HI>Poor</HI> ones too, that we are to <HI>sue</HI> unto our Lord Jesus Christ, when we come unto him. As a <HI>Beggar</HI> Petitions for an <HI>Alms,</HI> or, as a <HI>Pri|soner</HI> for his <HI>Life,</HI> so are we to Importune of our Lord Jesus Christ; that He would be concerned for our good. The Petiti|ons with which the miserable besought the healing miracles of our Lord Jesus Christ, in the days of His flesh, are to be imitated in the Requests which we should make unto Him for our Souls. We are to intreat of Him, <HI>Lord, I am so Blind, that I cannot see the things of my Peace; Help this Blindness</HI>! We are to Entreat of Him, <HI>Lord, I am so Lame, that I cannot Run the Way of thy Commandments; Help this Lameness</HI>! We are to intreat, <HI>Lord, I have a Soul grie|vously vexed with the Divel; O cast this evil Spirit out.</HI> Yea, we are to entreat, <HI>Lord, I am Dead in Trespasses and sins; O thou that canst Raise the Dead, Make my Soul to Live</HI>! This is fitt Language to visit a Jesus</P>
<P>Thirdly, We must come unto the Lord Jesus Christ, with a Lively <HI>Dependence</HI> on him. When we come unto our Lord Jesus Christ, we are to Rely upon him for the Com|munication of all that <HI>Blessedness,</HI> whereof
<PB N="86" REF="000654_0089_0FA99F4A30204830">
He has encouraged our expectation. When we have commited all our Soul-concerns in|to the hands of the Lord Jesus Christ&punc; we are to make a conclusion like <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">. 25.2. <HI>O my God, I trust in thee, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> be Ashamed.</HI> We must with a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> and <HI>Chearfulness</HI> of Soul, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> upon the Lord Jesus Christ, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> certainly do for us, all the Thing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> in the <HI>Word, whereon He has <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> to Hope.</HI> Having first Confessed, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> Lord <HI>can,</HI> and then Implored, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> <HI>would,</HI> be our Sufficient Redee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> should then Comfort our selves <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> that He <HI>will</HI> be so. We should now with a sweet Acquiescence of Soul, wait upon him, for <HI>Grace,</HI> for <HI>Glory,</HI> for <HI>every Good Thing.</HI> There is a certain <HI>Rest</HI> of Soul to be Endeavoured, as well as to be Pro|pounded, in our Coming to the Lord Je|sus Christ: the last <HI>Step</HI> of our <HI>Coming</HI> to Him, is accompanied with a <HI>Leaning</HI> on Him; and a saying, <HI>Why art thou disquieted within me, O my Soul! Hope in the Almigh|ty and the Compassionate Jesus; for He will bring thee unto the Praises of God for ever.</HI> Like the ancient Psalmist, having first with bitter strivings pleaded before the Lord Jesus Christ, <HI>O Lord, I beseech thee to deliver my Soul</HI>! then conclude, <HI>Return to thy Rest, O my Soul, for the Lord will deal bountifully with thee.</HI></P>
<P N="4"><PB N="87" REF="000654_0090_0FA99F4AEEAC41E8">IV. Being thoroughly Apprehensive, that we have no <HI>strength</HI> to <HI>come</HI> unto the Lord Jesus Christ, we should first <HI>Cry</HI> for that Strength, and then <HI>Try</HI> whether we cannot come. As for us, we <HI>cannot</HI> come unto the Lord Jesus Christ; altho' our Precious and Immortal Souls do justly lie at the Stake, if we <HI>Do not come.</HI> And we never shall <HI>Come</HI> unto the Lord Jesus Christ aright, until we do with much anguish of Soul, see that we cannot <HI>come</HI> or <HI>stir</HI> towards Him. Nothing renders men more Incapable of a due <HI>Coming</HI> to the Lord Jesus Christ, than a vain and a proud <HI>Opinion</HI> of a <HI>Free will</HI> in themselves, of it self able to Do this <HI>Good Work</HI>; Or than forgetting, <HI>That in all Salvation-work, it is God who works in us, both to Will and to Do, of His own good pleasure.</HI> 'Tis very unlikely, That God should give us the <HI>Faith</HI> to come unto the Lord Jesus Christ, unless we sub|scribe to that, in <HI>Eph.</HI> 2.8. <HI>Faith is not of your selves, 'tis the Gift of God.</HI> It is not likely that God should bestow upon us the <HI>Power</HI> to come unto the Lord Jesus Christ, without making us to own that in <HI>Eph.</HI> 1.19. <HI>We Be|lieve, according to the working of His mighty Power.</HI> It was hardly a stranger thing to see <HI>Peter</HI> walking on the Sea,, than to see a Sinner coming to the Lord Jesus Christ. O be sensible of this accursed <HI>Impotency</HI>! but at the same time see, that without the <HI>Grace</HI> of
<PB N="88" REF="000654_0091_0FA99F4BAC8E0568">
God we cannot so much as arrive to be thus far sensible. And yet there are two&punc; Things from which we should not be here|by discouraged.</P>
<P>First, We are to <HI>Cry</HI> that God would help us to come. When we are advised of such a thing as that in <HI>John.</HI> 6.44. <HI>No man can come unto me, Except the Father which hath sent me, Draw Him</HI>: It becomes us then humbly and warmly, to make that moan unto him, in <HI>Cant.</HI> 5.4. <HI>O Draw me</HI>! We cannot <HI>come</HI> to the Lord Jesus Christ, until we <HI>Turn</HI>; but how should we do <HI>That</HI>? That we may <HI>Turn,</HI> the way is to <HI>Cry</HI>; make that <HI>Cry,</HI> in Jer. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">1.18. <HI>Turn thou me, and I shall be Turned.</HI> O Ly before the Lord, and mourn before him, saying, <HI>Lord, I perish, and it is Just I should perish, if I do not come unto thee; but yet I cannot come; a Stone may as soon fly to Heaven, and become a Star in Heaven, as I of my self come to my Hea|venly Lord; O do thou then Help me to come, and so Grace, Grace, will have all the Glory.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly; Now <HI>Try</HI> whether God will not help us to come Attempt, I say; See, as the well-disposed man, at length got so far as in Marc. 9.27. <HI>To say with Tears, Lord, I Believe, Help mine Unbelief!</HI> So, see whether you cannot say, <HI>Lord, now at Last I come!

Soul in thy Hands, for thee to make me Happy for ever.</HI> We find, that the man with a <HI>Withered Hand</HI> in Math. 12.13. when he <HI>Try'd,</HI> could <HI>Stretch</HI> it out; Even so, Let us <HI>Try,</HI> whether the <HI>Withered Foot</HI> of our Souls be not Cured by the <HI>Soveraign Grace</HI> of God; and whether we cannot come to what we never could of our selves come unto.</P>
<P N="5">V. They that will come unto the Lord Jesus Christ, must Answer and Conquer all the <HI>Objections</HI> of unbeleef, against coming to the Lord. You may be sure that when our Faces are once Christ-ward, many <HI>Obsta|cles</HI> will be cast before us, by <HI>An evil heart of unbeleef.</HI> But as the ways to the <HI>City of Refuge,</HI> were Exactly and carefully cleared, among the <HI>Israelites</HI> of old, so must we do what we can to clear out of the way those things that might hinder us, in <HI>Flying for Refuge to the Hope set before us.</HI> As now,</P>
<P>Tis one objection of unbeleef, <HI>Thy sins are so Extraordinarily Circumstanced, that if thou shouldest come unto the Lord Jesus Christ, it is Impossible thou shouldest be welcome unto that Holy Lord.</HI> Let our Answer to this objection, be, <HI>that</HI> in 1. <HI>Tim.</HI> 1.15. <HI>Jesus Christ came into the world to Save sinners, of whom I am Chief.</HI> 'Tis for <HI>Sinners,</HI> that our Lord is become a <HI>Saviour; They</HI> are the <HI>Si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">k Ones,</HI> whom He is a <HI>Physician</HI> for&punc;
<PB N="90" REF="000654_0093_0FA99F4DE9D336E0">
and the worse, the deeper, the older their <HI>Sickness</HI> is, the more will be His <HI>Glory</HI> in the Saving of them. Tho' we are <HI>Great Sinners,</HI> yet we may plead it with Him, that He is, <HI>A Great Saviour.</HI> 'Tis true, we have been <HI>Ready to sin</HI>; but it is said of God in Jesus Christ, <HI>Thou art Ready to Pardon.</HI> 'Tis true, we have <HI>sinned abundant|ly</HI>; but it is said of our Lord, <HI>He will a|bundantly pardon.</HI> It was of old thrown upon Him as his Disgrace, <HI>He Receiveth Sinners</HI>; but it is his Honour, His Renown. His <HI>Blood,</HI> is, <HI>A Fountain set open for sin and for uncleanness</HI>; the most polluted Crea|ture among us all, may have Recourse to that <HI>Open Fountain.</HI> And, as long as we are not come to be such Apostates, Blas|phemers, and Persecutors, as to Hate the <HI>Blood</HI> of the Lord Jesus Christ, we may be sure that we are not fallen into the <HI>Unpardonable sin.</HI> Yea, if we are but <HI>Afraid</HI> of that Sin, 'tis a sign that we are not <HI>Fallen</HI> into it. He has already Received, not only to His <HI>Mercy,</HI> but also to His <HI>Kingdom,</HI> such as have been Guilty of the very same Sins, that now astonish our Consciences: He has Received a <HI>Menasseh</HI>; He has Received a <HI>Mary Magdalene.</HI> Is it the Sin of <HI>Uncleanness,</HI> that affrights us? Remember, By <HI>Faith</HI> Rahab <HI>the Harlot pe|rished not.</HI> Is it the Sin of <HI>Thievery,</HI> that
<PB N="91" REF="000654_0094_0FA99F4DF6DF35F0">
affrights us; Remember, The <HI>Thief on the Cross.</HI> Yea, Murder, and the <HI>Murder</HI> of the Lord Jesus Christ himself, did not put some out of Reach to the <HI>Mercy</HI> of that Blessed Lord.</P>
<P>Tis Another objection of unbeleef, <HI>Thou art not so prepared for the Lord Jesus Christ, as that thou mayest without presumption dare to come unto him.</HI></P>
<P>To this objection let us give <HI>that</HI> An|swer, in <HI>Rev.</HI> 22.17. <HI>Lest him that is athirst, come, &amp; whosoever will, Let him take the water of Life Freely.</HI> What is the true <HI>End</HI> of all those <HI>Preparations</HI> that are undergone by the Elect of God, in their coming unto the Lord Jesus Christ? they are that we may be made <HI>willing</HI> to come. So then, if we do but find our selves <HI>willing</HI> to have the Lord Jesus Christ, we need not scruple our liberty to come unto him. Are we so affected with our <HI>Ignorance,</HI> as to be willing that the Lord Jesus Christ should be our <HI>Wisdom</HI>? Are we so concerned about our <HI>Guiltiness,</HI> as that we are willing to have <HI>Righteousness</HI> by our Lord Jesus Christ? Are we so troubled for our <HI>Pollutions,</HI> as to be willing that the Lord Jesus Christ, should be our <HI>Sanctification? Is</HI> our <HI>Captivity</HI> so Irksome to us, that we are willing to have <HI>Redemption</HI> by the Lord Jesus Christ? Then <HI>Come,</HI> in Gods Name; say not, <HI>Shall I?
<PB N="92" REF="000654_0095_0FA99F4EADC289E0">
May</HI> I? but, <HI>Come,</HI> without any further Hesitation. We must not imagine to come unto our Lord Jesus Christ, with any Re|commendation but that of our being <HI>wretch|ed and miserable, and poor and blind and Naked.</HI> It is not under the Notion of <HI>prepared,</HI> but under the Notion of <HI>perishing</HI> Sinners, that we are to come unto Him. We would fain come unto Him <HI>with,</HI> such and such good Frames in our Souls; but we are to come unto Him <HI>for,</HI> what we cannot come unto Him <HI>with.</HI> Never stand pausing, whether you have under|gone such Degrees of <HI>Compunction</HI> and <HI>Contrition</HI>; beware lest you make a <HI>Christ</HI> of those things; but if you <HI>can</HI> come, <HI>Do</HI>; or however <HI>Do</HI> what you <HI>can</HI> to come. Do not say, <HI>Lord, Depart from me, for I am sinful man</HI>; but say, <HI>Lord, because</HI> I <HI>am a sinful man, therefore</HI> I <HI>will come unto thee.</HI> Or argue at such a rate as the Lepers did, <HI>Be sure, if</HI> I <HI>sit still,</HI> I <HI>dy</HI>; I <HI>may go forth and live: If</HI> I <HI>stay from the Lord Jesus Christ,</HI> I <HI>am ruined unavoidably; but</HI> I <HI>may come to Him, and have a good reception with Him: so this I'll do</HI>!</P>
<P N="6">VI. Because we have hearts most unac|countably <HI>Lothe</HI> to come unto the Lord Jesus Christ, we should lay before our selves all sit <HI>Incentives,</HI> to Provoke us, and Excite us thereunto. Tis <HI>Prodigious</HI>; but yet it is <HI>Notorious</HI>; There is nothing in the world
<PB N="93" REF="000654_0096_0FA99F4F6D925608">
whereto we are more Indisposed, than unto Believing unto the Lord Jesus Christ. Alas&punc; How often do we put our Lord, upon making that Lamentation over us, in Mat. 23.37. <HI>Ye would not!</HI> But it becomes us therefore to stir and spur up our own Souls, with very pene|trating Thoughts upon this matter, till hav|ing no other way to betake our selves but un<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> the Lord Jesus Christ, we are <HI>Shut up unto the Faith.</HI> May we then Re|tire, and ponder upon this <HI>Path of Life</HI>! There,</P>
<P>Let our first Consideration be This: <HI>Who is it, that Invites thee, O my Soul, yea, who is it, that Requires thee to come unto Him!</HI> It is no Less an One than the <HI>King</HI> of Heaven, the <HI>Lord</HI> of Glory, and the <HI>Son</HI> of God. O Heart of Adamant, that can Refuse the Favours of such an Illustrious <HI>Monarch</HI>! 'Tis a greater than the Empe|ror of the World, that H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lds out His <HI>Golden Scepter</HI> unto us; and says, <HI>Come, Sinners, you may Come and Live!</HI> 'Tis He that is, <HI>Mighty to Save,</HI> who bids us to Draw near unto Him, that we may be <HI>Saved</HI> by Him; 'Tis He that is the <HI>De|s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">re of all Nations,</HI> who <HI>Desires</HI> us, that we would but be willing to be Saved. This Great Person, whom all the Angels in Heaven Worship, 'tis <HI>He</HI> that has called for our coming unto Him; and He has
<PB N="94" REF="000654_0097_0FA99F502DED5300">
not only <HI>Invited,</HI> but also <HI>Required</HI> our doing so. If it be demanded of you, <HI>How dare you come unto the Lord Jesus Christ?</HI> You may with all Humility Re|ply, <HI>Because I dare do no other?</HI> The <HI>Winds,</HI> the <HI>Seas,</HI> the very <HI>Devils,</HI> were Obedient unto our Humbled Jesus: and how dare we be Disobedient unto our Exalted <HI>Prince</HI> and <HI>Saviour,</HI> when He comman<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">, <HI>Come unto me, that you may have Repentance and Remission of Sins!</HI></P>
<P>Let our next Consideration be, <HI>Shall</HI> I <HI>be a Looser by coming to the Lord Jesus Christ? No, shall I not.</HI> The Wise Man said, <HI>Of Labour there is Profit</HI>; but there is no <HI>Profit</HI> like that of this <HI>Labour.</HI> Let us come to our Lord; we shall find no mistake in that of the Psalmist, <HI>It is good for me to Draw near unto God</HI>! This Co|ming to the Lord Jesus Christ, is the most considerable Thing in that, <HI>Godliness which is profitable to all things.</HI> Come to the Lord Jesus Christ, and immediately, the God of Heaven will say to you, <HI>Be of Good Chear, thy sins are forgiven thee</HI>! Immediately the same God of Heaven, will say, <HI>This is a Dear Son, this is a plea|sant Child, I will surely have mercy on him</HI>! You will immediately be Entituled unto all the <HI>Great and Precious Promises</HI> of God; whatever has been purchased by the In|valuable

Blood of the precious Jesus, you may now write upon it, <HI>It is all mine</HI>; the God of Heaven will show you all the Good Things of Heaven it self, and say unto you, as once unto <HI>Abraham, All of these things will</HI> I <HI>give unto thee</HI>! Ah, Rock indeed, that such a Motive will not break!</P>
<P>Let our Third Consideration be, <HI>What will become of me, if</HI> I <HI>do not come unto the Lord Jesus Christ</HI>! Or, <HI>How shall</HI> I <HI>Es|cape, if</HI> I <HI>neglect so great Salvation</HI>? It is most Evident, That as there is more Glo|ry given to God, by coming to the Lord Jesus Christ, than in keeping all the <HI>Law</HI>; for God more Eminently manifested His Glory in the way of our being Saved by Jesus Christ, than in Giving of the <HI>Law</HI>; so, our Denying to come unto the Lord Jesus Christ, is the most horrid Act of Enmity and Rebellion against the Glorious God. Men must sin in some Instance a|bove the <HI>Devil,</HI> or else God would not Eternally punish them with the <HI>Devil</HI>; now this is done in Refusing to come unto the Lord Jesus Christ: And assuredly, and accordingly will it be Avenged! What is, <HI>A portion with Unbl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">evers,</HI> but the most fi|ery, hideous <HI>Portion,</HI> in the Dismal Vault below?

<HI>State of Probation,</HI> which our God has ap|pointed for us; and that we may be assist|ed in our <HI>Preparation</HI> for that GREAT WORLD, it is necessary that we should be furnished with some true Notions of it. But while we are <HI>Clothed</HI> with <HI>Flesh,</HI> the Notions of <HI>Spiritual</HI> Concerns, are most ea|sily conveyed unto us, by <HI>Metaphors</HI> fetch'd from such Objects, as do by our <HI>Flesh</HI> become sensible unto us; and the Beams of <HI>Light</HI> must come unto us from that <HI>Other World,</HI> with some <HI>Clothing</HI> from this upon them. Now Almighty God, Condescending in His Instructions to our Capacities, has been pleased Himself, to Intimate and as it were to Consecrate, certain <HI>Metaphors,</HI> for the use of our understandings, in shaping our Conceptions of such things as otherwise would be <HI>Unutterable,</HI> and He has pitched upon diverse things of common and famous use in Humane affairs, giving us this Directi|on thereupon, <HI>Make those things the Figures from whence your Thoughts are to take their Mea|sures, when you go to apprehend, the Deep things of God.</HI></P>
<P>Among the Profound <HI>Mysteries,</HI> whereof our Merciful God has Mercifully advised us, One is, <HI>That Everlasting and Immutable Counsel of His, whereby He has Chosen a Certain and Special Number of Men, to be Vessels for the Glory of His Grace forever, with an Eternal Repro|bation

passing over others.</HI> Now the Emblem or Shadow, under which our God would give us notice of this Glorious <HI>Mystery,</HI> is that of, A BOOK, wherein we may Ima|gine Entred, the Names of such as are to be Saved by the Lord Jesus Christ. Suppose a <HI>Daniel,</HI> a <HI>Paul,</HI> a <HI>John</HI> might on this Side the Third Heaven, have enjoyed a <HI>Vision</HI> of the Eternal Election, passing upon the Heirs of <HI>Life,</HI> that Election would not have been o|therwise than under the Shape and Form of, A BOOK, represented unto them. And the mention of A BOOK, in this case, may be supposed an allusion to the Publick <HI>Registers,</HI> used in Cities, Countreys, King|domes, and with almost all the Civilized Nations of this World; where the <HI>Names</HI> of such as might have any claim to fu|ture Priviledges, are usually Enrolled. The Ancient <HI>Israel</HI> of God, had most particularly their <HI>Books,</HI> wherein they that could not find their <HI>Names</HI> Inserted, were debarred from such Advantages as they which were therein Recorded, might pre|tend unto. Now the BOOK of <HI>Life,</HI> which indeed like our <HI>Life, is Hid with God&punc; in Christ,</HI> is Gods Decree of <HI>Election,</HI> where|in these and those men, are from all E|ternity with a most particular Designation, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> apart for the Obtaining of <HI>Life</HI> Eternal.

many as are Ordained unto Eternal Life</HI> Now the Eternal <HI>Choice</HI> of God, is that <HI>Book,</HI> wherein the Names of all that are thus <HI>Ordained,</HI> are most particularly Noted. The Decree of God, which has all that are to <HI>Live</HI> Happily for ever, as particu|larly, as if by <HI>Name</HI> Remembred in it: This is the <HI>Book of Life.</HI> And this <HI>Book</HI> is in our Text here Exhibited unto us, as containing the <HI>Catalogue</HI> of all the persons, who at the Approaching <HI>Day of Judge|ment,</HI> shall Escape, <HI>The Vengeance of Eternal Fire.</HI></P>
<P>Concerning this Illustrious BOOK of <HI>Life,</HI> there are two Assertions to be Ad|vanced, for the Introducing of the most weighty <HI>Case,</HI> that ever demanded your me|ditations.</P>
<P>One Assertion is, That no man having His <HI>Name</HI> once written in the BOOK of Life, shall or can, ever have it <HI>Blotted</HI> out again. Gods BOOK will never have any <HI>Blot</HI>: but it is the Purpose and Promise of God concerning eve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y man, that has his <HI>Name</HI> in that <HI>BOOK, Rev.</HI> 8.5. I <HI>will not Blot his name out of the Book of Life.</HI> If a Mortal Man could say concerning what he had written on the <HI>Cross</HI> of our Lord, <HI>What <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> have written,</HI> I <HI>have written</HI>: Much more will the Immortal God say, upon what He hath written in His Book about them
<PB N="109" REF="000654_0112_0FA99E866C646910">
that are to have <HI>Life,</HI> by the <HI>Death</HI> of our Lord, on that <HI>Cross, What I have Writ|ten, I have Written; and it shall never be Li|able to the Least Obliteration.</HI> This was the Old <HI>Austins</HI> way of arguing.</P>
<P>'Tis true, that <HI>Moses</HI> pleading for Sinful <HI>Israel,</HI> said, in Exod. 32.33. <HI>If thou wilt, Forgive their Sin, and if not, Blot me, I pray thee, out of this Book, which thou hast Writ|ten:</HI> I Insist not on that which many, and especially Jewish Interpreters, assign as the meaning of those words; That they refer to the <HI>Book</HI> of the Law, or the Pentateuch, where the Name of <HI>Moses</HI> does <HI>Live</HI> Re|nowned unto all Generations; <HI>q. d. I am willing it should never be Read or Known, that there was a man of my Name in the World.</HI> But it is possible, that the Man of God, might refer to the <HI>Book</HI> of <HI>Life Temporal,</HI> not the <HI>Book</HI> of <HI>Life Eternal</HI>; there is a <HI>Book of Providence,</HI> which has in it the Names of such as are to <HI>Out-Live</HI> the Wasting Plagues, that are to come upon their Neighbours; now says <HI>Moses, Let me rather now Dy my self, than that thy Name should be Dishonoured in thy Blo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ing out the Names of all this people from the Number of the Living.</HI> This was the sense, by <HI>Jerom</HI> and others of the Ancients put upon those words of <HI>Moses</HI>; and it is a Sense which the Context smiles very much

upon. But suppose that the <HI>Book</HI> of E|lection was intended in the words of <HI>Mo|ses</HI>; the Heroic Love and Zeal of that Saint, for the People of God, might pas|sionately propound, an <HI>Impossible Thing,</HI> in the pursuance of a <HI>Possi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">le.</HI> Our Lord Him|self in His Agoni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> mentioned such a Thing, and added, <HI>Father, If it be possible.</HI> What if in the Efforts of his Ardors, <HI>Mo|ses</HI> might say, <HI>Lord, rather than this People should perish, I could be content, if that were possible, to loose the Happiness, provided, I may not also Lose the Holiness, of my own Eter|nal Salvation!</HI> 'Tis but like the Carriage of a Charitable Brother, who Beseeching his Father to be Reconciled unto an Un|dutiful Son, should plead, <HI>Sir, Either pardon this my faulty Brother, or else Run me through with your Sword</HI>! a Thing which he knows will never be done. This, as to <HI>Moses.</HI></P>
<P>There is indeed a <HI>Negative</HI> Deletion out of Gods Book, sometimes mentioned in the Oracles of God; but not, a <HI>Positive.</HI> When we Read such places, as <HI>Psal.</HI> 69.28. and Rev. 22.19. about mens being <HI>Blotted out of Gods Book,</HI> the meaning of it is, That God will make it appear, they have never been at all <HI>Written</HI> there.

afterwards to be Blotted out of the Glorious <HI>Last</HI> which the Decree of God has made of His Elect, <HI>this</HI> were a Tenet big with Many and Grievous Blasphemies. The Decree of God, indeed Orders a mil|lion of Things, that are <HI>Conditionate,</HI> one unto another; but the Decree it self is not <HI>Conditionate</HI>; no, it absolutely deter|mines, as well the <HI>End,</HI> as all the <HI>Means</HI> Leading to that <HI>End.</HI> The God of Hea|ven has Decreed, that such and such men, shall arrive unto Eternal Blessedness; of all whom, I may say, as <HI>Paul</HI> about some of them, in <HI>Phil.</HI> 4.3. <HI>Their Names are in the Book of Life.</HI> But God has also De|creed that every one of these men shall certainly Repent, and certainly Believe, and in that way arrive to this Blessedness; nor can any one of these men, by pe|rishing in Impenitent Unbelief, procure his <HI>Name</HI> to be <HI>Blotted out of that Book.</HI> The old Pagans feigned their <HI>Graces,</HI> to be all of them Linked unto each other, by an <HI>Indissiluble Chain.</HI> But the Connexions between the <HI>Graces</HI> of our God, are still more Inseparable: you have them in <HI>Rom.</HI> 8:30: <HI>Whom He did pred<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">stinate, them He also called; and whom He called, them He also Justify'd; &amp; whom He Justify'd, them He also Glorify'd.</HI> This, all of this Infallibly and Unfailingly comes of, <HI>A Name written in the Book of Life</HI>! The Stability of the
<PB N="112" REF="000654_0115_0FA99E88ACE2E010">
Divine Election, is a Thing every where affirmed, by the Author of that Election; a thousand Scriptures conspire to tell us, <HI>That the purpose of God, according to Election shall stand.</HI> I Remember, that <HI>Solomon</HI> says, in <HI>Prov.</HI> 10.25. <HI>The Righteous is an Ever|lasting Foundation.</HI> The Apostle <HI>Paul,</HI> ap|plies this to all the <HI>Elect.</HI> They that have their Names <HI>Written in the Book of Life,</HI> have a two-fold <HI>Writing</HI> upon them|selves; One, <HI>The Lord knows who are his</HI>&punc; T'other, <HI>Let every one that Names the Name of Christ depart from iniquity.</HI> Now for them that are thus written, tis said of <HI>Them,</HI> with Regard unto the <HI>writing</HI> in 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 2.19. They are, first, a <HI>foundation</HI>; and, secondly, a <HI>Founda|tion of God</HI>; and, Thirdly, a <HI>sure Foundation</HI>; and, Fourthly, a <HI>Foundation that stands</HI>; and Fifthly, a <HI>Foundation that has a Seal upon it</HI>; never shall the <HI>Writing</HI> of such a <HI>Founda|tion,</HI> be scratched out! The principle of <HI>Grace,</HI> which must be infused into all that have their Names in the <HI>Book,</HI>, is an <HI>immortal Seed</HI>; it <HI>Remains,</HI> it <HI>Abides,</HI> it is a <HI>Well of Water springing up into Everlast|ing Life.</HI> The Covenant of <HI>Grace,</HI> which all that have their Names in the <HI>Book</HI> must be brought into, is <HI>Everlasting,</HI> and <HI>Perpe|tual</HI>; the Lord not only says, I <HI>will not Break it</HI>&punc; but also says, <HI>That He will keep us from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> so;</HI> He says, <HI>I we never Leave
<PB N="113" REF="000654_0116_0FA99E896E685730">
thee, nor Forsake thee.</HI> All that have their Names in the <HI>Book,</HI> shall be Married un|to the Lord Jesus Christ; but our Lord says, <HI>I hate putting away</HI>! The <HI>Power</HI> of God, and the <HI>Promise</HI> of God, is Engaged for, <HI>The Perseverance of the Saints</HI>; and the <HI>Intercession</HI> of the Lord Jesus Christ, must be Unsuccessful, and Insufficient, if any of them should not at last come to be, <HI>With Him, where He is</HI>!</P>
<P>In short, If any Name could be Really Blotted out from the <HI>Book of Life,</HI> it must be, either, because that God knows not cer|tainly who will come unto <HI>Life Eternal</HI> at the last, or, because God could not confer the <HI>Grace,</HI> which is Necessary to bring them unto that <HI>Life.</HI> But, it is fit, that such <HI>Pelagian, Arminian, Socinian,</HI> Blasphemies, be|come Abominable among the People of God.</P>
<P>But then, a Second Assertion is,</P>
<P>That a man, having his <HI>Name</HI> written in the Book of Life, may by a Blessed <HI>Assurance</HI> of it, be able to <HI>Read</HI> it there. Our Lord, said once unto His Disciples, in Luc. 10.20: <HI>Rejoice, because your Names are written in Hea|ven</HI>; and this is one of those things whereto He would have that Rule applyed, <HI>What I say to you, I say to all.</HI> So then a Disciple of Our Lord Jesus Christ on earth may with
<PB N="114" REF="000654_0117_0FA99E8A41166970">
Joy unspeakable see his Name written, <HI>In Heaven,</HI> among them that, <HI>For Heaven,</HI> at the last. Why are we enjoyned, in 2. <HI>Pet.</HI> 1 10 <HI>Give Diligence to make your Election sure.</HI> 'Tis not a certainty of the <HI>Object,</HI> but a certain|ty of the <HI>Subject,</HI> that we are directed unto the pursuance of: A man by diligence in the Exercise of all vertue may come to be <HI>sure</HI> of this, <HI>I have my Name Written a|mong the Eternally Elected of God.</HI> The Inse|parable consequents of a <HI>Name written in the Book of Life, may</HI> be known by them, that have them. The <HI>Grace</HI> of God, wrought in the hearts of them that have their Names in the <HI>Book</HI> of God; this is a discernible sort of a Thing; tis compared unto <HI>Fire,</HI> unto <HI>Light,</HI> unto <HI>Life,</HI> which make themselves evident where they are. One Good man has before now been able to say, <HI>Lord, I believe.</HI> Another Good man has been able to say, <HI>Lord, thou knowest that I Love thee.</HI> Yea, but they that are assured of such Things, may readily tell, where their <HI>Names</HI> are to be found. Good men may come to say, as in 1: <HI>Joh.</HI> 3 14. <HI>We know that we have passed from Death to Life</HI>; and this knowledge may assure them, that they have <HI>Names Written in the Book of Life.</HI> It was the assurance of a <HI>Job, I know that my Redeemer lives.</HI> But such a man may be also assured, that his <HI>Redeemer</HI> has written him a|mong
<PB N="115" REF="000654_0118_0FA99E8BB59A6D68">
them that are to be <HI>Redeemed. It</HI> was the assurance of a <HI>David, The Lord is my Shepherd</HI>; but such a Man may be also assured, that the <HI>Great Shepherd</HI> has written him, among the sheep of his <HI>Right-Hand.</HI> It was the assurance of a <HI>Paul, The Son of God has loved me</HI>; but he was then likewise assured of a Room in the <HI>Book</HI> as well as in the <HI>Heart</HI> of that Blessed Lord.</P>
<P>And this brings me to that most Impor|tant CASE. What should a Man do, that he may be <HI>Assured</HI> of a Name, Written in the Book of <HI>LIFE</HI>?</P>
<P>The Roman Historian Reports, that the Son of a Senator, understanding certain Honours to be decreed by the Senate for certain Souldiers, whose <HI>Names</HI> were for that cause written in a <HI>Book,</HI> he begg'd of his Father to let him see the <HI>Book,</HI> or to tell him at least, whether his <HI>Name</HI> were in the <HI>Book</HI>? His Father told him, <HI>These were Secrets</HI>; whereupon the Son ask|ed, <HI>Pray, Sir, tell me the General Qualifications of them, that have their Names in the Book,</HI> which when the Father did, the Son per|ceived himself to be none of them. Truly,
<PB N="116" REF="000654_0119_0FA99E8C6E051120">
<HI>The Book of Life,</HI> is One of the, <HI>Secret Things which belong unto the Lord</HI>; it were a vain and a mad curiosity, to think of Climbing Heaven for a view of <HI>That</HI>; we may say of it, <HI>I cannot Read, for lo, the Book is a sealed Book</HI>; but the <HI>Qualifications</HI> of them that may know their <HI>Names</HI> writ|ten in that Book, These are the <HI>Revealed Things, which belong unto us, and unto our Children.</HI> Attend, then, while I set <HI>Them</HI> a little before you; Attend, while I show you, what is like to become of you through|out Eternal Ages.</P>

Why, God hath a <HI>Book,</HI> wherein all that are <HI>New-Born</HI> have their <HI>Names</HI> writ|ten for ever.

<P N="2">II. Let a man Subscribe his <HI>Name</HI> to Gods <HI>Covenant,</HI> and he may be Assured, that he has his <HI>Name</HI> Written in the <HI>Book</HI> of God.

propound unto us as our chief Good</HI>? And, <HI>Whether we are willing that the Lord Jesus Christ, as the only Mediator, should both procure for us the Favour of this God, and also remove all the Ignorance and Enmity in our Minds, that keeps us at a Distance from God</HI>? Give your serious and solemn Consent, unto the Terms of this <HI>Cove|nant</HI>: Consent, my Neighbours, Consent unto the <HI>Way of Salvation,</HI> in this <HI>Cove|nant</HI> provided for; with Conquered Souls, make this Answer, <HI>Lord,</HI> I <HI>am willing to be Thine, in thy Covenant of Grace; and it is thy Grace alone that has made me so.</HI> Thrice and Four Times Happy Souls, your <HI>Names</HI> are then undoubtedly in the <HI>Book of Life.</HI></P>
<P>Yea, but that I may carry this matter a little further; what says the Prophet, in <HI>Isa</HI> 44.5. <HI>One shall say, I am the Lords, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> ano|ther shall subscribe with his hand unto <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Lord?</HI> There are some who Read it, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> shall give an hand-writing to be the Lords.</HI> It has been the Judgment and Advice of many Divines, That it would be a profitable Thing, for men to have the <HI>Covenant of Grace</HI> in a writing summarily laid before them, and for them with deep Resentments of Soul, to <HI>Sign</HI> it with their <HI>Hands</HI> as well as their <HI>Hearts,</HI> and to keep this <HI>Act</HI> for|ever by them, as a Perpetual Remembran|cer

unto them, that they are the Lords. Tis not easy to make any objection, against our being thus <HI>Explicit,</HI> in doing that, which must at least <HI>Implicitly</HI> be done by all Godly men. If this now be discretly, sincerely, thoroughly done, you may safely conclude, <HI>The Name that I have now written at the bottom of this Covenant, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">is as undoubtedly written in the Book of Life, before God for ever.</HI> When a man has thus <HI>by a deed<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of Gift</HI> made over himself un|to the God that made him, the <HI>Deed</HI> is pre|sently Recorded as it were in a Book of God; the man when he comes to Heaven, will find it there.

<HEAD>Proposition I.</HEAD>
<P>'Tis Peculiarly and Remarkably the Work of the <HI>Holy Spirit,</HI> whereby Sinners are <HI>Converted</HI> unto God. There are <HI>Three Persons</HI> in the Adorable God head; Three Relative Properties, which we fitly call, the <HI>Father,</HI> the <HI>Son,</HI> and <HI>Holy Spirit.</HI> We cannot indeed <HI>Fathom</HI> it, but yet we must <HI>Receive</HI> it, that there are those <HI>Three Sub|sistences</HI> in the Divine <HI>Essence</HI>; and indeed even the very <HI>first Line</HI> of the Bible point|eth at it. This is a Thing, which not the Light of <HI>Nature,</HI> but the Light of <HI>Scrip|ture,</HI> has Reveal'd unto us. If any ask, How we come to know this <HI>Trinity</HI> in God? I will answer, as <HI>Athanasius</HI> of old; <HI>Go to Jordan, and thou shalt see a Trinity.</HI> In Mat. 3.16, 17. On the Banks of <HI>Jordan,</HI>
<PB N="142" REF="000654_0145_0FA99EA3286F1300">
there at once discovered themselves. The <HI>Father,</HI> the <HI>Son,</HI> and the <HI>Holy Spirit.</HI> Tho' indeed a <HI>Trinity</HI> of persons in the God|head, might from the Old Testament also be Evinced, unto the fullest confutation of the Blind <HI>Jews,</HI> who now deny the <HI>Mystery.</HI> Now, there is the Glorious Co-o|peration of all these <HI>Three Persons</HI> in every Act of God, of which the Creature is the <HI>Object</HI>; yet there is a <HI>distinct manner</HI> of wor|king to be ascribed unto each of them. Thus in the <HI>Salvation</HI> of a Sinner, the Work of <HI>Contriving</HI> that Salvation, belongs to God the <HI>Father</HI>; the Work of <HI>Effecting</HI> it, be|longs to God the <HI>Son</HI>; But the Work of <HI>Applying</HI> it, belongs to God the <HI>Holy Spirit.</HI> And thence the <HI>Conversion</HI> of Sinners is that in which the <HI>Holy Spirit</HI> has a special In|terest. When men are <HI>Converted</HI> unto God, how is it wrought? We are told, Tit. 3.5. 'Tis by the <HI>Renewing of the Holy Ghost.</HI> The <HI>Regeneration</HI> of Men, What cause has it? We find in <HI>Joh.</HI> 3.5. They that are <HI>Born again</HI> are <HI>Born of the Spirit.</HI> The <HI>Sanctificati|on</HI> of men, what is the Rise of it?

</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="proposition">
<HEAD>Proposition II.</HEAD>
<P>There are many <HI>Methods</HI> by which the <HI>Conversion</HI> of Sinners is pursued by the <HI>Holy Spirit</HI> of God. We read in Gen. 6.3. about the <HI>Strivings of the Spirit,</HI> There are mul|tiplyed <HI>Strivings</HI> or <HI>Labours,</HI> with which the <HI>Spirit</HI> of God is at work about the Souls of men. These <HI>Methods</HI> are with some <HI>Effectual,</HI> and the Souls of men are thereby brought home to God. The <HI>Me|thods</HI> are with some <HI>Ineffectual,</HI> yet such as to leave the vile men inexcus<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ble before the Lord. But we should enquire what these <HI>Methods</HI> are?</P>
<P>First, There are <HI>External Endeavours</HI> used by the Spirit of God for the Conversion of men. As now; in the <HI>Ordinances</HI> of God, there are Endeavours of the Holy Spirit for our Spiritual Good. The Spirit breaths and mov<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s in the Appointments of the Gospel. As it was said in Neh. 9.3. <HI>Thou testifiedst against
<PB N="144" REF="000654_0147_0FA99EA46D4A5470">
them by thy Spirit in thy Prophets</HI>; The <HI>Spirit</HI> of God sends <HI>Prophets,</HI> Ministers, Messengers, with which he takes pains about the Con|version of ungodly men. The Prophet <HI>Isai|as</HI> could say, in Isa: 48.16. <HI>The Lord God,</HI> and His Spirit <HI>hath sent me</HI>&punc; Why, when the Embassadors of God, <HI>are beeseeching of men to be Reconciled unto him,</HI> the <HI>Spirit</HI> of <HI>the Lord God</HI> himself, accompanys them, in their Embassages and in those Beseechings. Again by the <HI>Providences</HI> of God there are Endeavours of the Holy Spirit for our Eter|nal Good. The <HI>Mercies</HI> of God, those are the things with which the Holy Spirit is <HI>drawing</HI> us to Christ; it is in them, that the Spirit of God may say, as in <HI>Jer.</HI> 31.3. <HI>With Loving Kindness have I drawn thee.</HI> The Lan|guage of the Spirit in every mercy is, <HI>O Fear the Lord and His Goodness!</HI> and, <HI>O let the Goodness of God Lead thee to Repentance!</HI> The <HI>Judgments</HI> of God, these are the Things, with which the <HI>Holy</HI> Spirit is <HI>driving</HI> us from Sin; for Them we may acknowledge to the Spirit of God, as in <HI>Job</HI> 10.2. <HI>Thou con|tendest with me.</HI> As the <HI>Rod</HI> has a <HI>voice,</HI> thus there is in every Judgment that voice of the Spirit, <HI>O Learn Righteousness</HI>! and, <HI>O see what an Evil and a Bitter Thing it is to Forsake thy God</HI>! In the Hand of the Spirit, <HI>Mercies</HI> do oblige, <HI>Judgments</HI> do demand our Conver|sion to the Lord.</P>
<P><PB N="145" REF="000654_0148_0FA99EA52C7180A0">Secondly, There are <HI>Internal Endeavours</HI> used also by the Spirit of God for the Conversion of Men. And these are of two sorts.</P>
<P>First, the Holy Spirit attempts the Conver|sion of men by <HI>Informing</HI> of them. He En|lightens them, and by their <HI>Illumination,</HI> they are made <HI>Partakers of the Holy Ghost.</HI> We are told, 1 Cor. 12.3. <HI>No man can say, that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost.</HI> The Holy Spirit perswades many a man, That the Lord Jesus is the <HI>Wonderful Med<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a|tor,</HI> without whom, <HI>There is no Name given, whereby we may be Saved</HI>; The <HI>Holy Spirit</HI> Enables many a man to <HI>Understand</HI> and <HI>En|tertain</HI> the Fundamental Articles of Religi|on, and thereby He makes their Conversi|on appear to be, as it is indeed, an Impor|tant Thing before them. 'Tis said of the Holy Spirit, <HI>Joh.</HI> 16.18. <HI>He shall convince the World.</HI> He convinces them, that they have grievously <HI>sinned,</HI> and plunged them|selves into innumerable <HI>Wants</HI> and <HI>Woes,</HI> by doing so; He convinces them, that a precious <HI>Christ,</HI> embraced by a penitent <HI>Faith,</HI> is the <HI>One Thing Needful</HI>; How of|ten does He Convince men, That there is a God, in whose <HI>Favour is Life,</HI>; that there is a <HI>Jesus,</HI> who <HI>delivers from the Wrath to come</HI>; that they must Rely upon the Lord Christ for <HI>Wisdom</HI> and <HI>Righteousness,</HI> and
<PB N="146" REF="000654_0149_0FA99EA5F0316700">
<HI>Sanctification</HI> and <HI>Redemption,</HI> if they would be made partakers of true Blessedness? And this is that he may <HI>Convert the World.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly The Holy Spirit attempts the Conversion of men by <HI>Affecting of them.</HI> And there are three things, which the Spirit of God affects many men into, when He is making <HI>Essays</HI> towards the Converting of them.</P>
<P>First, There are dismal <HI>Terrours</HI> which the Spirit of God often causes in unconver|ted men. He terrifies them with hideous Visions of their own <HI>Wretchedness</HI> and <HI>Misery</HI>: and aff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ightens them with a just Apprehensi|on, that if they continue as they are, <HI>He that made them will not have mercy on them, and he that formed them will show them no fa|vour.</HI> We read in Rom. 8.15. about the <HI>Spirit of bondage unto fear.</HI> The Spirit of God makes many a man see himself <HI>bound</HI> over to endure the <HI>Fearful</HI> and Fiery Wrath of God for ever; He enkindles in them a <HI>Fear,</HI> that He is <HI>angry with them every day,</HI> and that He will <HI>break them sore in the place of Dragons at the Last Day.</HI> Thus the Spirit made <HI>Faelix</HI> to <HI>tremble,</HI> in the Fore-bodings of a <HI>Judgment to come.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, There are serious <HI>Desires,</HI> which the Spirit of God often causes in unconver|ted men. He inflames warm desires in them after the <HI>Things of their Peace:</HI> and raises
<PB N="147" REF="000654_0150_0FA99EA6ADB0F9C8">
in them some Longings after <HI>Spiritual Bles|sings in heavenly matters in Christ Jesus.</HI> 'Tis the <HI>Spirit</HI> of God, that made the Jews cry out, Joh. 6.35. Lord, <HI>give us evermore the Bread of Life.</HI> The Spirit of God makes many a man desirous, O <HI>that my sin were pardoned</HI>! and, <HI>O that my heart were mollified</HI>! and, <HI>O that my Soul were bound up in the Bun|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> of Life</HI>! Thus the Spirit made <HI>Balaam</HI> wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h, O <HI>that I might dy the Death of the Righ|teous.</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly, There are Devout <HI>Resolves,</HI> which the Spirit of God often causes in Unconverted men. He fills them with <HI>Re|solves,</HI> to <HI>break off their sins by Righteousness</HI>: and with many purposes and intentions, that they will walk at <HI>Peradventures</HI> with God no more. 'Twas the Spirit of God that procured such an Inclination as that in them of old, Jer. 2.10. <HI>Thou sayest</HI> I <HI>will not transgress.</HI> The Spirit of God puts many upon such Resolutions, <HI>I have done Iniquity, but I</HI> will <HI>do so no more.</HI> The <HI>Vows</HI> men make, when a Dreadful Eternity is before their eyes&punc; their Sick-bed Vows, and Sea-storm Vows and the Vows which they make when Di|stress and Anguish is upon them, these are often excited by the <HI>Spirit</HI> of God. Thus the <HI>Spirit</HI> of God was concerned with <HI>Is|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">el,</HI> when&punc; they <HI>flattered God with their mouth.</HI> These are the <HI>Methods</HI> of the Holy <HI>Spirit,</HI>

</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="proposition">
<HEAD><HI>Proposition,</HI> III.</HEAD>
<P>Multitudes of wretched sinners <HI>Resist</HI> the <HI>Methods</HI> used by the Holy Spirit for the Conversion of their Souls; and in so doing they <HI>Resist the Holy Ghost.</HI> But how is this done? The Greek word here <HI>to Resist</HI> signifies <HI>To throw something in the way,</HI> to hinder the <HI>Passage</HI> or <HI>Journey</HI> of a|nother. The Spirit of God is in the <HI>way</HI> of Converting many a man, but the mad sinner will throw, something or other in the <HI>way</HI> of the Holy Spirit, so that He makes a stop, a stand, He goes no further in it; This 'tis to <HI>Resist the Holy Ghost.</HI> Particularly;</P>
<P>First, Unconverted Sinners, <HI>Resist</HI> the Spi|rit of God by <HI>Diversion</HI>; when the Spirit of God would be <HI>Renewing</HI> of them, they throw some <HI>Diversion</HI> in his Way. Perhaps this Holy Spirit cannot come at them, because of their <HI>Business.</HI> When the Spirit would have been Recovering of wicked <HI>Cain</HI> from his forlorn estate, we find in Gen. 4.17. He went away to <HI>building of Cities.</HI> Men so get and keep in the clattering noise of the <HI>world</HI>
<PB N="149" REF="000654_0152_0FA99EA831ADC218">
they always find something to do, and cre|ate a Thousand Hurries for themselves: Hence the Spirit of God never finds them at leisure enough, to do any thing upon them. Or, the Holy Spirit cannot come at them, be|cause of their <HI>Company.</HI> 'Tis said of bad <HI>Companions,</HI> in Prov. 5.9, <HI>Lest thou shouldest ponder the path of Life,</HI> their <HI>ways are mo|veable.</HI> Even so, least the <HI>Spirit</HI> of God should make men begin <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o <HI>Ponder,</HI> and <HI>Practise</HI> too, as they ought to do, the <HI>moveable</HI> and <HI>muta|ble</HI> Humours of their Society prove a fatal entangl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ment unto them; they hear so much and so loud their <HI>Boon Companions,</HI> that the Spirit of God can have no Admissi|on to speak unto them.</P>
<P>Secondly, Unconverted men <HI>Resist</HI> the Spirit of God by <HI>Denial.</HI> When the Spirit of God would be <HI>Renewing</HI> of them, they do throw a <HI>Positive Denial</HI> in his way, and so they send him away sorrowful. Their Impiety, is that in Job 21:14: <HI>They say to God depart from us, for we desire not the knowledg of thy ways.</HI> They say unto the Spirit of God <HI>Be gone, we desire not the happiness, which thou dost offer to us</HI>! They say unto him, <HI>Be gone, we desire not the Holiness, which thou dost a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">vize us to.</HI> It was a lamentable entercourse betwixt God and them, in Jer: 44.16: <HI>As for the
<PB N="150" REF="000654_0153_0FA99EAA6E707550">
word thou hast spoken to us, we</HI> will <HI>not hearken to thee.</HI> Thus the Spirit of God saies, <HI>Pray in thy Family, Pray in thy Retirement</HI>: but lewd men say, <HI>No, we</HI> will <HI>not</HI>! The Spirt of God saies, <HI>Bind thy self by an Holy Cove|nant vnto the service of the Lord</HI>; but wild men say, <HI>No, we</HI> will <HI>not</HI>! The Spirit of God entreats, <HI>O do not the Abominable things which</HI> I <HI>hate!</HI> But there are extravagant men that say, <HI>We will do them every day!</HI> The Spirit of God now goes away grieved at this Cursed Obstinacy.</P>
<P>Thirdly, Unconverted men <HI>Resist</HI> the Spirit of God by affronting, and abusing those in whom it is. Compare our Text with what follows, and you find things thus expressed. Mens <HI>Resisting of the Holy Ghost,</HI> is explained by their <HI>Persecuting</HI> of the <HI>Pro|phets</HI>: truly, to <HI>Persecute</HI> the Ministers of the Gospel, who are <HI>Ministers of the Spirit</HI>; this is to <HI>Resist</HI> the Spirit Himself. To scoff, or starve, or slay those men, whom the <HI>Holy Spirit</HI> hath made His <HI>Trumpets</HI> or His <HI>Temples,</HI> 'tis to <HI>Resist</HI> Him: So likewise to despise or oppose and suppress the Means of Grace, in which are the <HI>Demonstration<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> of the <HI>Holy Spirit,</HI> this is to <HI>Resist</HI> Him.

<P>This <HI>Resisting</HI> of the Holy Spirit, is that which confirms men in their impenitent unbelief. And this there is too doleful <HI>Rea|son</HI> for.</P>
<P>The Reason of it is, in short thus much; The <HI>Resisting</HI> of the Holy Spirit proves the <HI>withdrawing of that Spirit:</HI> He saies in Gen: 6:3. <HI>My Spirit shall not always strive</HI>; And if the Spirit shall cease to <HI>strive,</HI> the Sinner will never begin to <HI>turn.</HI> The Rule, the Old Rule, about the <HI>Evil Spirit,</HI> is too sadly verified in the motions of the <HI>Holy Spirit,</HI> if you <HI>Resist him he will Flee from you.</HI> The <HI>Dove</HI> will not care to tarr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, where no good entertainment is ever like to be afforded Him.

But it is the <HI>Justice</HI> of the Holy Spirit that Countenances this order of things; when Men <HI>Resist</HI> the Spirit of God it is but <HI>just</HI> with him to <HI>desert</HI> them.

my Enemies, and avenge me of those my Ad|versaries</HI>! It was their woful experience long ago, in Isa: 63:10. <HI>They rebelled and vexed his Holy Spirit, therefore He was turned to be their Enemy.</HI> The Holy Spirit becomes a terri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">le <HI>Enemy</HI> to them that will always <HI>resist</HI> him; and alas, now their Conversion is to be despaired of.

<P>Secondly, The <HI>Internal</HI> Methods of the Holy Spirit for our Conversion will also cease upon our long <HI>Resisting</HI> of Him.

<P>Secondly, A <HI>Resisting</HI> of the Holy Spirit, will provoke Him to leave us unto a <HI>Paenal Hardness</HI> of Heart. As it was of old said in Exod. 10.27. <HI>The Lord hardened the Heart of Pharoah</HI>; Upon <HI>Resistance</HI> the Spirit of God will so leave us, that nothing shall <HI>melt us,</HI> nothing shall <HI>fright</HI> us, no calls, no crys, no counsels will cause us to turn from our <HI>Evil Ways</HI>; our hearts will be like the <HI>Nether

<P>Thirdly, A <HI>Resisting</HI> of the Holy Spirit, will so exasperate Him, That He will give us up to commit all manner of abominati|ons without <HI>Remorse.</HI> 'Twas said of some Rom. 1.26. <HI>God gave them up to vile af|fections.</HI> Such an Horrendous Desolation, comes at last upon the Souls, that have long stood it out, against all the exhortations of the Eternal Spirit.

Holy Spirit of God, that you may fear, a little <HI>Resistence</HI> more may cause the Eternal Depar|ture of his influences from your Souls. Methinks I overhear the Holy Spirit of God saying to some of us, <HI>Be instructed, poor soul, be instructed quickly, lest I depart from thee, and thou become desolate for evermore.</HI> There are Souls whose <HI>Time</HI> is almost our, whose <HI>Glass</HI> is almost Run; the <HI>Inch of Candle</HI> is come just to the bottom with them; If they dont, presently, make a Good <HI>Bargain</HI> for Eternal Happiness, they must ne|cessarily perish in the <HI>dark.</HI> But, who are they? Let me speak plainly, &amp; as it becomes a <HI>Watch|man</HI> of your Precious and Immortal <HI>Souls,</HI> for which I would awfully suppose my self ac|countable.</P>
<P>First, You that have bin long <HI>Incorrigible</HI> un|der the Dispensations of the Holy Spirit, have cause to fear, that his <HI>Methods</HI> for your Conver|sion are very near an end. The Holy Spirit of God has been <HI>Besieging</HI> and <HI>Bel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">aguring</HI> of your Souls; but have you long refused to yield un|to Him?

<P>Secondly, You that have sinned <HI>against,</HI> until you have sinned <HI>away,</HI> great <HI>Convictions</HI> of the Holy Spirit, have cause to fear that shortly you shall not have them any more. Ye Souls in Danger, Hear what I say; you that have had your <HI>Consciences</HI> awakened by the words or works of God; you that by the Thunders of God, have been awakened into some <HI>pur|poses to transgress no more</HI>; if you have sti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ed those <HI>Convictions,</HI> there is danger of your be|ing speecily given over by the <HI>Holy one of Is|rael.</HI> The Lord said o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> old in Psal. 81.11.12. <HI>My people would not hearken to my voice,; so I gave them up.</HI> In<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ead of <HI>hearkning</HI> to the voice of the Holy Spirit, many a <HI>Drunken,</HI> many an <HI>Uncl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">n,</HI> many a <HI>Gaming</HI> Extravagant, will go, and commit the same sin again; at first they were in some trouble for it, but now, they can repeat their Villany without any <HI>Regret at</HI> all; Is this thy condition, unreclaimable sinner?
