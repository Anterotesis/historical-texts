<P>IN a General <HI>Assembly</HI> there is this Day Convened, a whole <HI>Province,</HI> that hath Eminently professed the <HI>Religion</HI> of the Lord JESUS CHRIST; and some Advice from the <HI>Lively Oracles</HI> of the Lord JESUS CHRIST, unto such a <HI>Province,</HI> now Labouring under the <HI>Deadly Tokens</HI> of <HI>His</HI> Displeasure, is this Day called for. The <HI>Text</HI> now to be Recommend|ed unto you, from these <HI>Oracles</HI> of Heaven, shall be one, wherein you shall see described&punc; the behaviour of the only People that the God of Heaven then had in the World, meet|ing together in a General <HI>Assembly,</HI> upon the Advice of his being Displeased with them. The most Reasonable, and the most Seasona|ble Things, that I can Recommend unto you, in this critical Time, are those Three Things which were done by the General <HI>Assembly</HI> of <HI>Israel,</HI> in the <HI>Text</HI> whereto I now desire your serious Attention.</P>

<P>And they gathered together to <HI>Mizpeh,</HI> and they drew water and poured it out before the Lord; and they Fasted on that Day; and they said there, We have Sinned against the Lord. <HI>[Unto which, if we duely Attend, we shall be ready for the following passages;]</HI> And Samuel Judged the Children of Israel; But the Lord Thundered with a great Thunder upon the Philistines, and discomfited them.</P></Q>

<P>I Confess, that I now Entertain you with a <HI>Text</HI> very proper, for a <HI>Day of Humi|liation:</HI> but it is for this very cause that I pitch upon this <HI>Text,</HI> as a very Agree|able Entertainment for us: inasmuch as we are generally agreed, That we are in most <HI>Humbling</HI> Circumstances.</P>
<P>'Tis possible, that it was an <HI>Anniversary</HI> So|lemnity of a <HI>Sacred</HI> Importance with the Peo|ple of <HI>Israel,</HI> when the memorable Actions here mentioned were performed. Jewish and An|cient Records have told us, that at the <HI>Feast of Tabernacles,</HI> they did every Day fetch a silver Flagon of <HI>Water,</HI> and pour it out at the <HI>Altar,</HI> with the <HI>Wine,</HI> for the <HI>Drink Offering</HI>; to sig|nify

the pouring out of the <HI>Holy Spirit,</HI> after the Coming of the <HI>Messiah,</HI> who indeed, was af|terwa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ds Born at the very Time of that <HI>September Festival</HI> For this Custome, we find no Insti|tution; but the countenance which our Lord Jesus Christ gave unto it, when He thence formed a Reflection upon the <HI>Living Waters</HI> of the <HI>Holy Spirit</HI> which He has to give, would make one think, whether it were not first Insti|tuted by the Inspired <HI>Samuel,</HI> in that History which is now before us. But we have a further Assurance, that five dayes before the <HI>Feast of Ta|bernacles,</HI> namely, on the <HI>Tenth</HI> Day of the <HI>Seventh Month,</HI> a <HI>Fast</HI> was kept for a <HI>Day of Expiation</HI>: Even on the same Day that <HI>Moses</HI> having <HI>Thrice Fasted</HI> forty dayes together, came down to his people, with the News of the Lords being Reconciled unto them. I know not whether the Prophet <HI>Samuel,</HI> might not, a lit|tle divert some Actions of that Great Solem|nity, unto the Designs of <HI>Repentance,</HI> which the extraordinary Calamities upon his people did now require. But still, our <HI>Anniversary</HI> So|lemnity of a <HI>Civil</HI> Importance, this Day recur|ring, will be the better accommodated&punc; by our proposing those Actions to ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> present Imita|tion.</P>

Pagans the <HI>Philistines,</HI> had made cruel and bloody Depredations, upon several of their Villages: and besides their Loss of men, by the Hand of the <HI>Philistines,</HI> they lost a great number of their <HI>Principal men,</HI> by the more Immediate Hand of Heaven upon them. The <HI>least comp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tation</HI> of that mischief, is that of them, who thus read the Story: When they were together met from all Quarters at <HI>Beth|shemesh,</HI> about <HI>Fifty Thousand People,</HI> the Lord smote <HI>Threescore and ten men</HI>: and it may be those <HI>Threescore &amp; ten men</HI> were equivalent un|to <HI>Fifty Thousand People,</HI> of the more common sort. Under these awful Judgments of God, they continued Impenitent, for as many years, as have ran out, since the Children of those <HI>Philistines</HI> were first let Loose upon our selves; even for <HI>Twenty</HI> years together. But it was well for them, that they had a <HI>Samuel</HI> among them; a faithful Minister of God, who had no little part of their <HI>Civil,</HI> as well as of their <HI>Sacred</HI> Affairs, falling under his Direction. Up|on the Exhortations of that Blessed <HI>Samuel,</HI> they began to <HI>Lament after the Lord,</HI> that is, to cry unto the Lord for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ievous <HI>Lamen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ation</HI>; and they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> <HI>private Reformations</HI> of their Families, all the Land o|ver, to their <HI>Lamentations.</HI> But <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> must have something more publickly done in this matter: the whole Body of that People must

<P>We have <HI>Three Things</HI> here done, by a <HI>Ge|neral Assembly</HI> of <HI>Israel.</HI></P>
<P>First, <HI>The Drew Water, and poured it out <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the Lord.</HI> This passage puts <HI>Interpreters,</HI> as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he Dead Body of <HI>Asahel</HI> did the Travellers, and Spectators, unto a <HI>Stand</HI>; they almost con|tent themselves with saying, <HI>Mirabilis hic locus, ac Difficilis</HI>; 'Tis too hard for us to <HI>Interpret</HI> it. But, if the Exposition, which we have al|ready <HI>guess'd,</HI> will not <HI>hitt,</HI> there are several o|ther Conjectures to be made upon the <HI>Literal Sense</HI> of this passage, which we will at present wave; that we may in the room thereof sub|stitute that <HI>Figurative Sense,</HI> which has no less Authority, than that of the <HI>Chaldee Paraphrase</HI> to support it; <HI>Hauserunt Aquas e puteo cordis sui, et abunde Lacrymati sunt coram Domino.</HI> And indeed, Expositors do mostly go this way; Expounding it of the plentiful <HI>Years</HI> which they shed in such abundance, as if, to use the the words of the <HI>Weeping</HI> Prophet elsewhere, <HI>Their Heads had been Waters, and their Eyes a Fountain of Tears.</HI> However, Let us take what
<PB N="6" REF="000755_0007_0FAA5007EA2A9DE0">
<HI>Sense</HI> we will, of all that the Commentators have ordinarily offered us, the words will still have some Sense of <HI>Humiliation</HI> in them. The other two passages, are more Intelligible.</P>
<P>Secondly, <HI>They Fasted on that Day</HI>:</P>
<P>Thirdly, <HI>They said there, we have Sinned a|gainst the Lord.</HI> Behold, the <HI>Supplication,</HI> and, Behold, the <HI>Reformation,</HI> which this <HI>Humiliation</HI> was attended withal. The circumstances of it, here specified, that it was, <HI>On that Day,</HI> and that it was, <HI>There,</HI> intimate that they were no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> willing to <HI>Delay,</HI> the Work of <HI>Repentance</HI> any longer: they counted it <HI>High Time</HI> for them to make thorough work of it, and they would not rise from the <HI>place</HI> until they had accom|plished the work.</P>
<P>There are <HI>Three Things,</HI> which the Text thus <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">aid before us, would Awaken us all unto: <HI>Three Things</HI> which if duely attended, <HI>Thrice</HI> and <HI>Four Times</HI> Happy from this Day, will be our Land, which is at this Day. <HI>Trembling</HI> and <HI>Shaking,</HI> by the <HI>Breaches</HI> that God makes upon it. I will not leave my Text, though I do mow call in another Text, for the <HI>Application</HI> of it, and make, <HI>The present State of</HI> NEW-ENGLAND, the Text which we shall now insist upon.</P>
<P N="1"><HI>I.</HI> May the <HI>Tears</HI> of a profound HUMI|LIATION, be this Day shed among us, upon
<PB N="7" REF="000755_0008_0FAA5008E32F2808">
the Sorrowful Occasions of those <HI>Tears.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Tears</HI> of an <HI>Humbled,</HI> a <HI>Melted,</HI> a Bro|ken Heart, O let us <HI>Draw that Water,</HI> and <HI>pour it out before the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>When the General Assembly of <HI>Israel, poured out Water before the Lord,</HI> it is the Opinion of some, that they designed with an <HI>Hieroglyphick</HI> of much <HI>Humiliation,</HI> to express their own Ca|lamitous Condition. A State Irretrievably ca|lamitous, is thus described, in 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 14.14. <HI>We are as water spilt upon the ground, which can|not be gathered up again.</HI> Thus the Intention of the General Assembly here, might be, most significantly to say, <HI>Lord, see whether we are not a People so utterly Lost&punc; and Spoilt, and Gone, that it is as impossible to Retrieve our doleful Cir|cumstances, as to gather up the Water which is pou|red out upon the Ground.</HI> Now, thy Condition, O poor <HI>New England,</HI> is indeed so very like that of <HI>Water poured out,</HI> that it pathetically ob|ligeth us all, to <HI>pour out the Water</HI> of our <HI>Tears</HI> before the Lord. <HI>Weeping,</HI> is one of those Exercises, whereto the God of <HI>Heaven</HI> calls His people, to <HI>Humble</HI> themselves before Him. And in the Bible we have many Instances of a <HI>Practice,</HI> according to that <HI>Precept,</HI> in Joel 2.12. <HI>Turn ye to God, with all your Heart, with weeping, and with mourning.</HI> Indeed the <HI>Tears</HI> of the <HI>Eye,</HI> are to be expected of men, more or less, according to their <HI>Natural Constitutions.</HI>
<PB N="8" REF="000755_0009_0FAA5009D58CC4F8">
It is desirable, that the <HI>Eye,</HI> which has been the Grand <HI>Broker for Sin,</HI> should by its <HI>Tears</HI> bear its part in discovering the passions of our minds thereupon. But where the <HI>Eye,</HI> does not Naturally afford so free a Channel to that Brine, which the compression and constriction of the <HI>Brain</HI> upon <HI>Grief</HI> produceth, we have still our <HI>Sighs,</HI> which <HI>Austin,</HI> well calls, our <HI>In|teriour Tears.</HI> And now, O our <HI>Tears,</HI> where are you!</P>
<P>We read concerning a General Assembly, in <HI>Judg.</HI> 2.1. <HI>An Angel of the Lord came unto them, and said, I brought you unto the Land, which I sware unto your Fathers; but ye have not obeyed my voice; wherefore there shall yet be Thorns in your sides: And it came to pass, when the Angel of the Lord spake these words, the people lift up their voice and wept; And they called the Name of the place Bochim</HI>; i. e. Weepers. Oh! why should not <HI>Boston</HI> this Day, be thus called <HI>Bochim.</HI> So <HI>Autocratorically</HI> spoke that <HI>Angel,</HI> that it seems to have been the <HI>Messiah</HI> himself, appearing in an Humane Shape; even, the same <HI>Angel of the Covenant,</HI> that had formerly appeared unto <HI>Joshua</HI> at <HI>Gilgal</HI>; and therefore 'tis here said, <HI>He came up from Gilgal.</HI> Permit a poor Servant of that Blessed <HI>Messiah,</HI> thus to Expostulate with you; <HI>The Lord of Heaven from whom I come unto you, brought our Fathers into this Good Land, which He provided for us; But we have
<PB N="9" REF="000755_0010_0FAA500A65BC6E50">
not obey'd His voice; and this our Disobedience He has chastised with continual Thorns in our sides.</HI> Why should we not <HI>Lift up our voice</HI> &amp; <HI>weep,</HI> at such doleful Tidings!</P>
<P>I am sure there are such Things as these to bespeak our <HI>Tears.</HI></P>
<P>First, The Horrid <HI>Sins</HI> committed in the Land, yea, commonly committed, loudly call for our <HI>Tears.</HI> Alas, it may be said of us, That <HI>we have been Drinking in Iniquity like water.</HI> How much ought we then to, <HI>Drop it away in Tears,</HI> as I may say, when we <HI>p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ur out Water before the Lord! Bloody</HI> Crimes, like those, the Imputation whereof, made our Lord Jesus Christ, <HI>Sweat</HI> out His very <HI>Blood,</HI> have abound|ed among us; and will they not cause us to <HI>weep</HI>? Truly, <HI>Tears of Blood,</HI> were little enough to bewayl our <HI>Bloody, Scarlet, Crimson</HI> Abomi|nations. There is not one of all the <HI>Ten Com|mandments,</HI> in the Law, which our God has given us, but people are notoriously violating of it, from one end of the Land unto the o|ther. While our Land is full of Unconverted, Unrenewed, Unsanctifyed <HI>Sinners,</HI> how should it be any other than full of all <HI>Ungodliness</HI>! And yet such is the vast multitude of <HI>Dead Souls</HI> among us, or of Souls which do not <HI>Live</HI> unto God, by vertue of <HI>Union</HI> with the Lord Jesus Christ, that we may with Horror say, <HI>There is hardly an House, in which there is not one
<PB N="10" REF="000755_0011_0FAA500AF1839150">
Dead</HI>: Nor may we wonder at it, if the Holy God in His Dispensations, treat our <HI>Land,</HI> as <HI>Unclean,</HI> when the <HI>Dead</HI> in all Societies are so very many. Truly, If we had a real kind|ness for the <HI>Holy and Just and Good Law of our God,</HI> or for our N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ighbours, that Ruine them|selves by sinning against that <HI>Law,</HI> we shall in some sort say with him, in <HI>Psal.</HI> 119.136. <HI>Ri|vers of waters <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> down my Eyes, because they keep not thy Law.</HI> Oh! shall we not <HI>mourn,</HI> when we see, That the <HI>VVorld</HI> is become the <HI>Idol,</HI> of almost all our little World, but the Lord Jesus Christ, and His <HI>Great Salvation</HI> very <HI>little</HI> con|sidered? That the <HI>Institutions</HI> of the Lord Je|sus Christ are shamefully neglected, and the <HI>Superstitions</HI> of a <HI>vain Conversation</HI> practised? That the <HI>Names, Words, Works</HI> and <HI>Ordinances,</HI> and <HI>Providences,</HI> of the Lord Jesus Christ, are most Irreverently &amp; Unprofitably look'd upon? And, That we have a <HI>Profane</HI> Indisposition to the <HI>Sabbaths</HI> of the Lord? Shall we not <HI>Mourn</HI> when we see the <HI>Disorder</HI> which confounds all Societies, and the <HI>Selfishness</HI> which depraves the most in all Societies? Our <HI>Hating</HI> &amp; <HI>Vexing</HI> of one another? Our <HI>Unchastity</HI> in all sorts of <HI>Pol|lution?</HI> Our <HI>Injustice</HI> in our Dealings? Our ma|nifold <HI>Falshood</HI> in our Affayrs? Our <HI>Discontent</HI> in every Station? We could, in a <HI>Synod</HI> of our Churches, near Seventeen years ago, charge our selves with Epidemical Breaches of all the Rules
<PB N="11" REF="000755_0012_0FAA500BD2D1C3A8">
of <HI>Love,</HI> to God, and man. And verily, t'would be a brave Sponge to Dry up our <HI>Tears,</HI> if we could say, that we are mended since the Admonitions of that faithful <HI>Synod,</HI> But besides the more common Violations of the Di|vine Law among us, there are more Special out-breakings of Sin, in the midst of us, for which, no <HI>Tears</HI> are enough. We may say, but Oh! not without our <HI>Tears,</HI> as in Jer. 5.30. <HI>A won|derful &amp; Horrible Thing is committed in the Land.</HI> The Land was fearfully Defiled, by the Impi|eties of the <HI>Indians,</HI> which were the first Inha|bitants. Now, is it not <HI>A Wonderful &amp; an Hor|rible Thing,</HI> for so many <HI>English</HI> that have Suc|ceeded them, to <HI>Indianize,</HI> and by the <HI>Indian</HI> Vices of <HI>Lying,</HI> and <HI>Idleness,</HI> and <HI>Sorcery,</HI> and a notorious want of all <HI>Family-Discipline,</HI> to be|come obnoxious unto the old Score, and Store of wrath due unto the Land? Is it not <HI>a Won|derful &amp; an Horrible thing,</HI> that the Sins of <HI>So|dom,</HI> should so much prevail in a Land, which was once a <HI>Land of Uprightness?</HI> For, <HI>this was the Iniquity of our Sister Sodom, Pride, Fulness of Bread, and Abundance of Idleness; neither did she strengthen the Hand of the Poor &amp; Needy</HI>: The whole <HI>Spirit</HI> of all their <HI>Dealings,</HI> was, it seems, a General contrivance to <HI>Oppress,</HI> one another. Is it not a <HI>Wonderful &amp; an Horrible Thing,</HI> that in such a Land as this, there should be the Sins that made the <HI>Old Land of Canaan, Vomit out
<PB N="12" REF="000755_0013_0FAA500EC119A978">
her Inhabitants</HI>? For so did those Infandous, &amp; Confounded, Mixtures, that have openly shown their Heads among our selves. There was a Time, when one Returning from hence to <HI>England,</HI> could in a Sermon to a very Honoura|ble Auditory, give this Report concerning us, <HI>I have been Seven years in a Country, where I ne|ver beheld one common Beggar, I never saw one man Drunk; I never heard one Profane Oath, for all the Time of my being there.</HI> But is it not a <HI>Wonderful &amp; an Horrible Thing,</HI> that the Vices of <HI>Drinking</HI> &amp; <HI>Swearing,</HI> are now every Day, the objects of our Observation; I pray, let it be a <HI>Sorrowful</HI> Observation? And is it not a <HI>Won|derful &amp; an Horrible Thing</HI>&punc; that it should be a Complaint made about <HI>New England, Righteous|ness once Lodged in it, but now Murderers</HI>? I do speak it, with a Great concern of Soul; The <HI>Tears</HI> of a bitter Detestation, are necessary to cleanse this Land, from the Guilt &amp; Shame, of the <HI>Murderous</HI> Things, that have been with too much credibility Reported, as done by some <HI>New-Englanders</HI>! God forbid, That I should Reproach my Country. As the Apostle could say, <HI>I do not make my Appeal, as having any thing to Accuse my Nation of</HI>: So I would say, <HI>I do not Accuse my County, of any Thing, but what any o|ther Nation may as much be charged withal.</HI> But, when <HI>Caesar</HI> saw one that was nearly Related unto himsel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, among the Wretches that were

Stabbing of him, he cryed out, with a Singular Agony, <HI>What? You my Son! Have I a Son among you!</HI> Thus, there is <HI>this</HI> Aggravation upon all of our Miscarriages: Our Lord Jesus Christ from Heaven may thus Argue with us; <HI>If other Peo|ple do Wound me by their Sins, 'tis not such a Won|derful and horrible Thing: But for you, O my Peo|ple, of</HI> New England, <HI>a People that for the Liber|ties of my Gospel, I have known above the other Fa|milies of the Earth; a People that are obliged unto me, above the rest of mankind: For these Vile Things to be done among you, my Children</HI>! Oh! This is a <HI>Lamentation, &amp; it should be for a Lamentation?</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, No <HI>Tears</HI> are enough to Bewayl the visible <HI>Degeneracy,</HI> which is to be Instanced, let me <HI>plainly,</HI> and <HI>humbly</HI> say so! in all Orders of men throughout the Land. When there was a Second Edition of the <HI>Temple,</HI> among the People of God, it is noted, in Neh. 3.12. <HI>The Ancient men, who had seen the first House, when the Foundation of this House was laid before their Eyes, they wept with a loud voice.</HI> Truly, the few <HI>Ancient men</HI> that are left among us, do <HI>weep with a loud voice,</HI> when they see how mi|serably <HI>Temple-work</HI> is now circumstanced, in the <HI>Second</HI> and <HI>Third</HI> Generation of the Coun|trey. Tho' we may <HI>Shout aloud for joy,</HI> when we see <HI>so much</HI> of Christ, and of <HI>Truth,</HI> and of <HI>Grace,</HI> among us; for indeed, <HI>so much</HI> there is, that if they who talk of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> this Coun|try,

would please to stay, as methinks they should, until they hear of a Country that has proportionably more of CHRIST in it, there would for the present, be little said of a Remo|val! Yet let not this Hinder our joyning with such as <HI>weep with a loud voice</HI> for our Degene|racy. It is affirmed, That many sorts of Infe|riour Creatures, when Transplanted from <HI>Eu|rope</HI> into <HI>America,</HI> do Degenerate by the Trans|plantation; But if this Remark must be made upon the <HI>People</HI> too, what can we do, but spend our <HI>Tears</HI> upon such a sad Remark? Our Lord Jesus Christ from Heaven seems to bestow that Rebuke upon us, in Jer. 2.21. <HI>I planted thee a Noble Vine&punc; How then art thou Turned into the Degenerate Plant of a strange vine unto me! New England</HI> once had a famous Governour, name|ly, <HI>Hopkins</HI> of <HI>Connecticut,</HI> whose words were, <HI>I fear, I fear, the Sins of</HI> New-England <HI>will e're long be read in its punishments.

I take Notice, That when <HI>David</HI> Numbred the <HI>People,</HI> there was a <HI>Great Sin</HI> cleaving to that matter; and it was not Holy <HI>David</HI> alone, but it was the <HI>People,</HI> whom the Lord was in that matter chiefly offended at.

God had Required, That when the People were Numbred, <HI>Every man should give a Ran|some for his Soul unto the Lord, That there be no Plague among them</HI> (says he) <HI>when thou Num|brest them.</HI> Now, because the Lord had a Controversy with that People, for their <HI>For|mer Iniquities,</HI> he leaves <HI>David,</HI> the Best man in the Nation, to act in this weighty matter, without the Advice of the <HI>Priests of the Lord</HI>; Hence, tho' it was not a Sin simply to <HI>Number the People,</HI> yet the <HI>People</HI> not being put upon their part, that they might be <HI>Ransomed</HI> from a <HI>Plague</HI> among them, it became a Sin and a Snare unto them: Now, as an effect hereof, I take Notice of a strange Threatning, in 2 Sam. 24.13. <HI>Shall seven years of Famine come unto thee, in thy Land?</HI> Whereas, the Threat|ning runs no more than so, in 1 Chron. 21.12. <HI>Three years of Famine.</HI> I pray, How shall these two passages be Reconciled?

Much, very, very much will be done towards a Glorious <HI>Reformation,</HI> by our Discharging the work of our Ministry, as under the Awe of that most awful Considera|tion, in Heb. 13.17. <HI>They watch for Souls, as they that must give an Account.</HI> I Remember, Tis Related concerning the Holy Mr. <HI>Herbert Pal|mer,</HI> That observing of Sundry Evils to have been become common in his Town of <HI>Canter|bury,</HI> he took such Pains to convince the People of those Evils, that at last, they generally Sign|ed an Instrument, wherein they Declared their <HI>Dislike</HI> of those Evils, and their <HI>Purpose</HI> to take heed of them forever; and a wondrous <HI>Refor|mation</HI> ensued upon it. Syrs, who can tell, how far the concern of <HI>Reformation</HI> may possess the Hearts of our People, in almost every Town, if we took due pains to convince them, and per|swade them; yea, if our Personal, Prudent, Loving Admonitions, might but operate, upon that one part of Neighbours, the <HI>Inn-keepers,</HI> who can tell how far the Desired <HI>Reformation</HI> might be Befriended and Attained! But this leads me into another Article of our Discourse.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="000755_0059_0FAA50353064D6F8">Fourthly. To Assist the Designs of <HI>Reforma|tion</HI> among us, Why should we not Review, &amp; Renew, and Apply, the <HI>Obligation,</HI> which is by <HI>Covenant</HI> Lying upon us thereunto? If one would say at once, what it is, that hath procur|ed the Indignation of Heaven against us, to be written in such Dismal and Bloody Characters, methinks, I could find a passage in our Psalter, that should Expressively enough describe it. While the Time was not yet come, that the <HI>Israelites</HI> in <HI>Egypt</HI> should be delivered out of their Difficulties, the Active Colony of <HI>Ephrai|mites</HI> formed a Lively <HI>Expedition,</HI> against the <HI>Philistines</HI> to the <HI>North-ward,</HI> from whom they had Received many Injuries; they reckon'd themselves Numerous and Powerful enough, to attack the <HI>Canaanites</HI> in their own Country; but they came off unhappy loosers in it; and the Psalmist ha's told us, what was the reason of the loss that befel them: T'was, as in Psal. 78.10 Because, <HI>They kept not the Covenant of God.</HI> This I venture to say, whatever else may be said; <HI>Covenant-Breaking,</HI> I say, <HI>Covenant-Break|ing,</HI> or, the Neglect, and Contempt of that <HI>Cove|nant,</HI> even, the <HI>New-Covenant,</HI> wherein the Lord Jesus Christ, ha's been tendring Himself unto us; <HI>This,</HI> is the most comprehensive Cause of all our <HI>Disasters.</HI> I will say so, as long as I can Read that horrid Picture of our own condition, in Isa. 24.4. &mdash; <HI>the Lord makes the Land Empty,
<PB N="59" REF="000755_0060_0FAA5035D513BC98">
and makes it wast, and turns it upside down, and Scatters abroad the Inhabitants thereof; The Land mourns and fades.</HI> And why is all this? <HI>Because they have broken the everlasting Covenant; there|fore the Inhabitants of the Land are Burned, &amp; few men are left.</HI> Wherefore&punc; if we would be Re|covered out of our Condition, 'tis the <HI>Covenant</HI> of our God, that must Recover us, &amp; <HI>Reform</HI> us. 'Tis imagined by some, That when the General Assembly of <HI>Israel</HI> here, <HI>Poured out Water before, the Lord,</HI> they used a Rite of making of a <HI>Cove|nant</HI>; q. d. If we Return to our Sins, let our <HI>Blood</HI> be thus <HI>Poured out.</HI> This we all know; A Renovation of <HI>Covenant,</HI> ha's been alwayes pressed, as a very special and Important Expe|dient of <HI>Reformation.</HI> The <HI>Covenant of Grace,</HI> which is <HI>Brought</HI> unto us all, is very particularly <HI>Seal'd</HI> and <HI>Own'd,</HI> with such as have been Ad|mitted unto any <HI>Ecclesiastical Priviledges</HI> among us. Let all Persons, by the Help of <HI>Grace,</HI> give the consent of their Souls unto this <HI>Covenant</HI>; Consent, O Immortal Souls, That God should be your <HI>God,</HI> and be unto you, better than all your Idols; that the Lord Jesus Christ should be your <HI>Prophet, Priest,</HI> and <HI>King</HI>; that the Holy Spirit should Possess you, and incline you to Glorify Him according to the Gracious Terms of this <HI>Covenant</HI> for ever. But then, Let them that have Enjoy'd the <HI>Seals</HI> of this <HI>Covenant,</HI> a|gain, and again, with all possible Solemnity
<PB N="60" REF="000755_0061_0FAA50366D4E8E78">
Repeat the Consent of their Souls thereunto. Syrs, A most wondrous <HI>Reformation</HI> would fol|low hereupon Immediately! Now, In the do+ing of this Thing, Why should not our Chur|ches, most Explicitly <HI>Apply,</HI> the <HI>Covenant of Grace,</HI> unto all the Designs of <HI>Reformation,</HI> as well as they <HI>Apply</HI> it unto the particular Designs, of a <HI>Particular Church-state</HI> before the Lord? Our <HI>Covenant</HI> will to the most Edification, and the most Satisfaction, be <HI>Renewed,</HI> when we most of all Express the <HI>Spirit of the New<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">Cov<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ant</HI> in all that we do. Now, 'Tis the <HI>Spirit of the New Covenant,</HI> for us to Acknowledge, That our <HI>Justification</HI> only by <HI>Faith</HI> in the <HI>Righteousness</HI> of our <HI>Saviour</HI> and our <HI>Surety,</HI> does powerfully oblige us to <HI>Depart from all Iniquity</HI>: And, Then, to Acknowledge, That this and that Evil Thing, whereof we are advised, is an <HI>Iniquity,</HI> from which we do, with our very Hearts within us, Desire to <HI>Depart</HI> for ever: But with such Ac|knowledgments, we are to <HI>Protest</HI> in all Sincerity of Soul, That we ask the <HI>Grace</HI> of Heaven, to <HI>Watch</HI> against every such <HI>Abominable Thing,</HI> both in our selves, and in one another. What one <HI>Christian</HI> upon Earth would scruple to consent unto such <HI>Acknowledgments</HI> and <HI>Protes|tations</HI>? Now, if our <HI>Churches,</HI> yea, and other <HI>Societies</HI> too, would thus use the <HI>Covenant of Grace,</HI> with pertinent Applications thereof, to every <HI>New Iniquity,</HI> that they Discern arising

among them, how gloriously might the <HI>Spir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> of Grace,</HI> then <HI>Lift up a Standard</HI> against every <HI>Flood</HI> of Iniquity! As fast as we see any <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> gaining of ground upon us, Let us make our <HI>Evangelical Acknowledgments</HI> and our <HI>Evangeli|cal Protestations,</HI> against that Sin; These are the <HI>Sanctified Wayes</HI> in which the Almighty Spirit of Christ, will make us <HI>Conquerors, and more than Conquerors,</HI> over that Sin for ever. And shall I add this one thing more? There are many sorts of <HI>Officers</HI> among us, that are under very special <HI>Oaths,</HI> unto God, for <HI>Well-Doing</HI>; and these would surely <HI>Do well,</HI> to have Copies of their <HI>Oaths,</HI> well Explained unto them, often before their Eyes.

Now, This one thing would exceedingly contribute unto the <HI>Reformation</HI> of the Land&punc; That men often <HI>Read</HI> and <HI>Think,</HI> what they are <HI>Sworn</HI> to <HI>Do</HI>: For this would put the Good men, upon more usual <HI>Thoughts</HI> in themselves, <HI>What Good they may do in their several Places for other men?</HI> It is mentioned, as a Commendable property, in a Citizen of <HI>Zion,</HI> Psal. 15.4. <HI>He sweareth to his own Hurt, and Changeth not.</HI> It may be rendred, <HI>He Sweareth to an Ill man, and Changeth not.</HI> If he have made a <HI>Lawful Promise,</HI> though it be to a Wicked man, a Pagan, an Enemy, he will not reckon that the Wicked unworthiness of the man, will Release him from his Promise.

<P>But then, Lastly, to put an <HI>Edge</HI> upon these Things; That we may be in Earnest about the Necessary <HI>Reformation,</HI> Let us consider the loud calls of Heaven, that most earnestly bespeak it of us. <HI>The Necessity of Reformation,</HI> is a Thing that ha's been long and oft Preach'd unto us, ever since that the <HI>Judgments</HI> of God, began to make us more generally miserable; but the <HI>Judgments</HI> of God, are going on still to further and further Degrees of misery upon us, while the <HI>Cares</HI> of a <HI>Necessary Reformation,</HI> continue fast asleep in our Souls. We do one year after a|nother feel the formidable Executions, of those Threatnings, in Lev. 26 23. <HI>If ye will not be Re|formed by me, through these things, but will walk contrary unto me, Then will I also walk contrary unto you, and I will Punish you yet Seven Times for your Sins.</HI> Our most Intolerable Indisposition, to do any Significant Thing, towards our <HI>Ne|cessary Reformation,</HI> ha's been already Revenged, with <HI>Sore Plagues, and of long Continuance</HI>; Yea, The Lord ha's made our <HI>Plagues Wonderful,</HI> for this our Obdurate &amp; Obstinate Impaenitency. Wherefore, As they cryed unto <HI>Pharaoh, Let the men go; knowest thou not yet that Egypt is destroyed?</HI>
<PB N="64" REF="000755_0065_0FAA503BC33E8160">
Even such a cry must I this Day awaken you withal; <HI>Know you not, that</HI> New-England, <HI>is very near destroy'd, by the Sins that have been Harboured among us?</HI> Oh! Let them <HI>Go!</HI> Let them <HI>Go</HI>! Lest we perish in them. Christians, Let us take Warning. There have been many <HI>Thousands,</HI> I say, many <HI>Thousands,</HI> of Churches in <HI>Europe,</HI> not much less famous for the Protestant Religion, than that little Handful &amp; Hundred of Churches, whereof this Country is composed; Every one of which, have been made an utter Desolation, within these few years; even since the Time that so Young a Man as I am, came into the World. And, is not the Fate of those Chur|ches, a Solemn Warning to us, in these <HI>Ends of the World?</HI> I say again, Let us take the Warn|ing, and, <HI>Repent, Lest we likewise Perish.</HI> Don't you see, the Tokens of the Divine Wrath against us, arise apace towards an horrible Extremity? <HI>O Lord, They who dwell in these uttermost parts, are afraid at thy Tokens</HI>! I'l say only these Two Things. One thing is this; If there be not an Extraordinary Appearance of <HI>God, from Heaven,</HI> to give a check unto a Great <HI>Leviathan,</HI> who is at this Day Troubling all the <HI>European</HI> Waters, <HI>New-England</HI> will be soon overwhelmed in De|solation. Another thing is this; If we should have such a <HI>Summer</HI> this year, as we had the last, for the <HI>Unseasonable Weather,</HI> which, alas, hitherto does hold, upon the Fruits of the Earth,
<PB N="65" REF="000755_0066_0FAA503D59094958">
the Desolation of <HI>New-England</HI> will be more horrid, than any Tongue, ha's hitherto Expres|sed, or Heart Conceived. On every side of us then, we have that cry Roaring in our Ears, <HI>Reformation, or Desolation! Reformation, or Deso|lation</HI>! Oh! Tis <HI>High Time to Awake out of our Sleep,</HI> and to do some Signal Thing for the <HI>Re|formation</HI> of our Land. Consider, O our <HI>Zerub|babels,</HI> O our <HI>Joshua's,</HI> and O all ye People of the Land: <HI>Necessity is laid upon us, and W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> unto us if we Do it not.</HI></P>
<P>And now, if these calls of Heaven, are, by your <HI>Tears,</HI> and by your <HI>Prayers,</HI> and by your <HI>Cares,</HI> duely complied withal, there is a twofold <HI>Benediction,</HI> from our Lord Jesus Christ, our <HI>High-Priest,</HI> who went away from hence to Heaven, <HI>Blessing</HI> of us, that I do from the Word of His, now before us, Conclude withal.</P>
<P N="1"><HI>I.</HI> You shall have <HI>Samuels</HI> to be <HI>Judges</HI> over you.
