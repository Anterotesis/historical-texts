<P>WHereas there is nothing more evident in holy Scriptures, than when a Nation or People do with-draw their Affections from God and his holy Ordinances, and &s;uffer them&s;elves to be mi&s;-guided by their wild and natural Appetites, that Religion and Government becomes Contemptible, and the People degenerate into Loo&s;ene&s;s and Prophanene&s;s, bla&s;pheming the holy Name of God, and &s;peaking evil of Dignities and Powers. And whereas it is ob&s;ervable, that of late years the People of this Province not having a due regard to tho&s;e holy Duties which are required of them by Almighty God, in the holy Scriptures, have fallen into grea<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" EXTENT="1 letter"> Divi&s;ions, Striffes, Di&s;&s;entions and Uncharitablene&s;s, encourageing among&s;t them&s;elves Back-biting, fal&s;e Rumors, Enmity, Variance want of Love, and all &s;orts of immoralities and Prophanene&s;s, to the great Scandal of the holy Chri&s;tian Religion, and the endangering of the Peace of his Maje&s;ties Government, thereby provoking the Almighty God to Anger, &amp; ju&s;tly bringing upon this Province tho&s;e Judgments of his Wrath which have lately attended us in the grievous and afflictive Changes of the Sea&s;ons, by which much of the Fruit of the Earth are bla&s;ted, and rendered un&s;erviceable to Man. And whereas Almighty God hath at all times &s;ignified his great &amp; unex+pre&s;&s;ible Love unto Mankind, by with-drawing the Rod of his Judgments upon a Nation &amp; People, from them, when &s;uch People have with contrite hearts and unfeigned Repentance, humbled them&s;elves before him, acknowledging his infinite Power and holy Name, and have al&s;o with fa&s;ting and Prayer &s;upplicated his gracious favour for the removing of all tho&s;e Judgments where-with he hath afflicte<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" EXTENT="1 letter"> his People. To the end therefore that the Wrath of God may be appea&s;ed, and that the&s;e Judgments which are now upon this Land and Province, and daily threaten the &s;ame, may be removed, and that the People thereof may be no longer divided, &s;eperated and di&s;united <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"> their Affections unto God, and to his Maje&s;ty, our mo&s;t gracious Soveraign, and to one another, I have therefore thought fit, by &amp; wit<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" EXTENT="1 letter"> the advice of his Maje&s;ties Council, to publi&s;h &amp; proclaim a &s;olemn Day of Fa&s;t and Prayer.
