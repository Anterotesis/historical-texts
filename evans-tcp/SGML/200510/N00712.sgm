Soul to God, and manife&s;ts his holy affections to others, e&s;pecially in this P&s;alm. It is parted into Twenty Two Paragraphs, each begin with an Hebrew Letter Alphabeticaly, the fir&s;t with <HI>Aleph,</HI> and &s;o on; &s;o that we have it thus repeated eight times in the whole, and may well be called the true Chri&s;tians In&s;tru|ctor, in which God Teacheth him not only by his Word, but the Examples of Saints the true practi&s;e of Godline&s;s. By his Precepts he tells us, what we ought to do, and the way we &s;hould walk in to Salvation, by Recorded Ex|amples what Saints did that were in this way of Salvation, which we are to Enquire after for our Imitation. <HI>Jer.</HI> 6.16. <HI>Thus &s;aith the Lord, Stand ye in the wayes, and &s;ee and ask for the old paths, where is the good way, and walk therein, and ye &s;hall find re&s;t for your Souls.</HI> This Example before us is thought to be <HI>Davids,</HI> who probably was the Pen man of the P&s;alm. In this Paragraph which is the Eighth in or|der, &amp; begins &amp; ends with the Letter <HI>Cheth.</HI> The P&s;almi&s;t begins with a&s;&s;erting his right in God <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> his <HI>Portien, ver&s;e</HI> 57. which he proves.</P>

<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> 1. In general take this de&s;cription of it.</P>
<P>It is the Exerci&s;e of all the powers of the Rational Soul by mans Self Reflection for the knowledge of his ways or actions, and for his right Judgment of them with reference to Gods final approving Judgment.</P>
<P N="1">1. It is the Exerci&s;e of all the Powers of the Rational Soul, the Under&s;tanding, Will and Affections.</P>
<P N="2">2 In way of Self-Reflection for the know|ledge of his actions, which is peculiar to a
<PB N="15" REF="000858_0008_0FABF14CB30923C8">
Rational Creature, and mainly intends his mo|ral actions, as under the direction of a moral Rule for his Obedience, and Happine&s;s, in Enjoyment of God, according to his promi&s;e, to his obedience. <HI>Gen.</HI> 2.9.</P>
<P N="3">3. It is for his Right Judgment of them. Man hath a Judicature in him&s;elf, God hath Authorized in him, and is the &s;upream and highe&s;t on Earth; &s;ubordinate only to God about his own actions in reference to God, and his inward duty to him. Rom. 14.4. <HI>Who art thou that judge&s;t another mans &s;ervant? to his own ma&s;ter he &s;tandeth or falleth.</HI> None are to judge others in things that are indifferent in matters of Religion, or doubtful to true Chri|&s;tians, but them&s;elves, about the &s;incerity in them or not. <HI>ver&s;.</HI> 13. <HI>Let us not therefore judge one another any more, but con&s;ider our own wayes.</HI> The Judge is Con&s;cience. 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 1.12. That is a Witne&s;s as well as a Judge, having the be&s;t knowledge of what is in man, next to God. 1 Cor. 2.11. <HI>For what man knoweth the things of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">n man, &s;ave the Spirit of man which is in him?</HI> And hath Authority in the man to &s;tir up all the powers in it, for its right judgment, therefore the P&s;almi&s;t here &s;aith, <HI>I thought,</HI> be|ing &s;et on work by Con&s;cience that is &s;eated in the heart or practical judgment, that influ|enceth the whole. 1 <HI>Joh.</HI> 3.20, 21. <HI>If the heart condemns,</HI> (that is Con&s;cience) God is greater,
<PB N="16" REF="000858_0009_0FABF14DE8C16920">
and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">till much more condemn; but if it does not there may be Appeals to God to Ju&s;tify, and confidence in it through Chri&s;t. P&s;al. 130.4. <HI>But there is forgivene&s;s with thee that thou may&s;t be feared.</HI> Its Knowledge and Authori|ty to &s;tir up the activity of the Rational Pow|ers is in order to this Judgment.</P>
<P N="4">4. It is with reference to Gods final approv|ing judgment of them. This is the chief end of the power of Con&s;cience in man. It is to be approved of God; all our Actions may in his final judgment. 2 <HI>Cor</HI> 5.11. It was &s;o in mans Innocency, to prevent &s;in, to ju&s;tify in way of perfect Obedience; and &s;ince the Fall under the Go&s;pel its main u&s;e is to further e&s;|caping Gods Condemnation of them. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 11.32. by judging them&s;elves, and appealing to Gods Gracious Throne for approbation and pardon through Chri&s;t.</P>
<P N="2">2. More particularly, I &s;hall endeavour to &s;hew what are tho&s;e Exerci&s;es of the powers of the Soul when Con&s;cience is awakened to its duty, in order to true turning to God, are &s;tirred up by it, and in what order.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t. The under&s;tanding power of the Soul, it &s;ets that a work, which is the fir&s;t Ope|ration of the Soul in order to Returning to God; a &s;eeing and knowing of our wayes or actions&punc; None can rightly judge of what he doth not know, and right knowledge of them
<PB N="17" REF="000858_0009_0FABF14DE8C16920">
mu&s;t go before any &s;erious thoughts about <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">ending them, or returning to a right way; we mu&s;t &s;ee we are wrong. For clearing this, take the&s;e Remarks about it.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t. That in mans fir&s;t Creation. God gave man an Excellent Under&s;tanding; not only into the natures of all other Inferiour Creatures, to give them &s;uitable names there|unto, but al&s;o to know his own duty to God as the way to his Happine&s;s; not only by the written Law of God in his heart, but his po&s;i|tive Law in the Sanctions of the Covenant with him: He Reveals what is good, and his way to his Happine&s;s. <HI>Gen.</HI> 2.9, 17. and what is evil, that which God forbids. And he had a freedom and power to will and choo&s;e the one, and refu&s;e the other, but Created and Mutable; and &s;o by the abu&s;e of that power hath lo&s;t it, and his knowledge with it of mo|ral good and evil, wholly as &s;aving, and any right judgment of it in order to it.</P>
<P>Secondly. In Fallen man there are &s;ome Remains, as &s;ome call them, of the light of nature in their Con&s;ciences; or as others ra|ther would call them, common gifts to fallen man; God gives to all men as benefits in com|mon from Chri&s;ts Death to all mankind, that are beneficial to Humane Society, though not
<PB N="18" REF="000858_0010_0FABF14DEC24EB28">
&s;aving to the per&s;on. Thus we read, Rom. 1.18. <HI>Who hold the truth in unrighteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> (that is, &s;in again&s;t the light of Con&s;cience) The Heathens had a natural light about good and evil, as beneficial or de&s;tructive to Humane Society. <HI>Ver&s;e</HI> 29. <HI>who know that they that do &s;uch things are worthy of death.</HI> And &s;ome know|ledge of duty to God by the help of the works of Creation. <HI>ver&s;e</HI> 19, 20. <HI>Becau&s;e that which may be known of God, is manife&s;t in them, for God hath &s;hewed it unto them, For the invi&s;ible things of him from the Creation of the world are clearly &s;een, being under&s;tood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and God head, &s;o that they are without excu&s;e,</HI> which though not &s;aving, yet l<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">t them without excu&s;e; and Sins again&s;t it, deprived them of much of Gods common Goodne&s;s, and brought them under much of pre&s;ent di&s;plea&s;ure, and the effects of it, which might have been avoided. Rom. 2.14, 15. <HI>For when the Gentiles which have not the law, do by nature the things contained in the Law:</HI> (That is in that Law written, the Scriptures) <HI>the&s;e ha|ving&punc; not the law, are a law unto them&s;elves. Which &s;hew the work of the law written in their hearts, their con&s;cience al&s;o bearing witne&s;s, and their thoughts the mean while accu&s;ing, or excu&s;ing one another.</HI></P>

help for the knowledge of our ways, and fur|thering Saving Returning out of that Apo&s;ta&s;y, and after-&s;trays from his Rule. And that is the Di&s;pen&s;ation of his Word.

<P N="1">1. There is a further outward light and di&s;|covery of Sin, in the &s;inful and penal evil of it; the written Law of God makes di&s;covery of the evil nature of it in that original pravity of our natures &s;ince the Fall, and of all our evil practices.

<P N="2">2. There are common gift&s; of the Spirit, which much heightens the light of nature in thus &s;eeing Sin and the Remedy, and &s;ome|times powerful Convictions and Awakenings of Con&s;cience thereby.

<P>The &s;econd operation of the Rational Soul to be exerci&s;ed, is the Memory, whereby things known are kept and recalled when actu|ally forgotten, and is of &s;pecial u&s;e in turning to God; and in fixing the thought upon our ways.

<P>Hence 2. The &s;econd act of memory is needful and u&s;eful to the cure of Apo&s;ta&s;y, which is recalling to mind that which, is actu|ally forgotten concerning Gods Law, his Or|dinances and Providences, and our own &s;ins.</P>

<P N="3">3. Another operation of the Soul needful to the Recovery from Apo&s;tacy, is Thoughtful|ne&s;s or Con&s;ideration of our ways, which fol|lows that of memory; as we cannot remember what we do not know, &s;o cannot think of it <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">f we do not remember; this affords matter for con&s;ideration and meditation. Truth is the food of the Under&s;tanding, which it commends to, and &s;tores in the Memory; and meditation concocts for u&s;e and nouri&s;hment to the whole man, the will and affections of the Soul to live and walk in the &s;trength of it, and is prin|cipally here intended and expre&s;&s;ed by; I thought or con&s;idered my ways, and turned.
<PB N="26" REF="000858_0014_0FABF155487223D0">
The thoughts are the perfecting acts and ope|rations of the Soul, whereby the Idaea and I|mage of things are framed in it, which it un|der&s;tands and remembers, and hath the mo&s;t immediate influence on the will and affections, as they have on the actions.</P>
<P>As things we outwardly &s;ee are repre&s;ented by the phan&s;ie and common &s;en&s;e to the un|der&s;tanding; &s;o when they are practically known and remembred it is conceived in the will and affections, as a Child in the womb, and are therefore called the fir&s;t born of the under&s;tanding. And though a man doth not always outwardly practi&s;e and bring forth to outward view all &s;uch thoughts to mans judg|ment of him, yet they as in the thoughts are in Gods view&punc; and he judgeth his &s;tate thereby as good or bad; &s;o he &s;aith of fallen man as in his natural e&s;tate. Gen. 6.5. <HI>The imagination or figments of his heart are evil, and that continually.</HI> Prov. 23.7. <HI>As he thinketh, &s;o is he.</HI> And there|fore he calls for thy change, as the begining of our true turn to him. I&s;a. 55.2. <HI>Let the wicked for&s;ake his ways, and the unrighteous his thoughts, and Return.</HI> Jer 4 14. <HI>Wa&s;h thy heart, O Jeru&s;a|lem&punc; how long &s;hall vain thoughts lodge in you.</HI> And he judgeth of his true Conver&s;ion to him by this begining of it. 2 Chron. 6.37. <HI>If they be|think them&s;elves and turn.</HI> So that it is nece&s;&s;a|ry and u&s;eful in Recovery from Apo&s;ta&s;y, as

that God stirs up Con&s;cience to excite in them that do turn into the right way. I &s;hall not further enlarge upon what, thoughts are, being limited by my Text, to the Activity of them in our own ways, as the &s;pecial &s;ubject or ob|ject of them, to further turning into Gods ways.

<P>Secondly, Meditate on the penal evil of it, what your &s;in de&s;erves? What Afflictions and Effects of Gods Di&s;plea&s;ure for your &s;ins? So meditate on Gods pre&s;ent Providences, as the puni&s;hments of your evil ways, <HI>Hag.</HI> 1.8, 9,

And &s;tirs up the exerci&s;e of it. <HI>Acts</HI> 2.37. <HI>Now when they heard this, they were pricked in their heart, and &s;aid unto Peter, and to the rest of the Apo&s;tles, Men and Brethren, what &s;hall we do?</HI> And to revive it where it is. <HI>P&s;al</HI> 39.3. <HI>My heart was hot within me, while I was mu|&s;ing the fire burned: then &s;pake I with my tongue.</HI></P>

in their Concerns of this World. The Merchant thinks on his way in his Trade, whether right, and how he pro&s;pers, by looking over his Accounts. The Marriner hath his Compa&s;s and Ob&s;ervation how he Steers his Cour&s;e by it, to mend it where it is otherwi&s;e then it &s;hould be.

<P N="3">3. Con&s;ider. It is an evidence of Gods thoughtfulne&s;s of you of Peace and Salva|tion, and that from Eternity. Jer. 29&punc;10, 11, 12. <HI>I will vi&s;it you, and perform my good word towards you, in cau&s;ing you to return to this place. For I know the thoughts that I think towards you, &s;aith the Lord, thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give you an expected end. Then &s;hall ye call upon me, and ye &s;hall go and pray unto me, and I will hearken un|to you.</HI> And it is pleaded here by <HI>David,</HI> as a &s;ign of his Integrity and Effectual Vocation. Jer. 31.3. <HI>I have loved thee with an everla&s;ting love: therefore with loving-kind|ne&s;s have I drawn thee.</HI> So it is pre&s;ented for the Con&s;ideration of Gods People, to further their Repentance, as encouraging to Con&s;ideration as a means to it.</P>

<P N="1">1.
