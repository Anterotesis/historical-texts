<HEAD>JOURNAL of the Siege of the <HI>Havannah,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">1762. <HI>June</HI> 6<HI>th.</HI></NOTE>AFTER a very fortunate pa&s;&s;age thro' the old Straits of Bahama, the fleet arrived within &s;ight of two &s;mall forts to the Ea&s;tward of the Havannah, &s;ituated upon two rivers about three miles di&s;tant from each other. The whole fleet brought to, &amp; Sir George Pocock, with 12 &s;ail of the line, &s;ome fri|gates, and all the &s;tore &s;hips, bore away for the mouth of the harbour, to block up the Spani&s;h Men of War that were there and to make a feint on the other &s;ide, in order to facilitate our landing on this. Commodore Kep|pel, with &s;everal &s;ail of the line, and &s;everal &s;mall frigates, was ordered to remain with the tran&s;ports, to protect and conduct the debarkation of the troops, which was deferred 'till day. There was too much wind, and too great a &s;urf from the &s;hore to effect it at that time.</P>
<P N="7">7<HI>th.</HI> By break of day this morning, the army landed without oppo&s;ition between the two forts Bacarans and Coxemar. The one was &s;ilenced, and taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of by the Mercury and another frigate; the other was taken by the Dragon, of 74 guns. They were defended by a con&s;iderable number of pea&s;ants and negroes in arms, who very &s;oon abandoned them, and fled into the woods. The Earl of Albemarle, with the light infantry and grenadiers of the army, pa&s;&s;ed the river Coxemar, where his lord&s;hip took his quarters that night. The re&s;t of the army lay upon their arms along the &s;hore, with the picquets advanc|ed into the woods.</P>
<P N="8"><PB N="4" REF="009165_0003_1030FD175B38FE80">8<HI>th.</HI> Lord Albemarle marched the main body of the army early in the morning to a village called Guanamacoa, about 6 miles from the landing place, and &s;ent Colonel Carleton through the Coxemar wood, with a finall corps of troops, to the &s;ame village, to endeavour to cut off the re|treat of a corps of the enemy, &s;aid to be a&s;&s;embled there, and which his lord&s;hip determined to attack. The enemy were drawn up to receive us, and very advantageou&s;ly po&s;t|ed upon a ri&s;ing ground between us and the village. Their cavalry marched down in a large body to the light infant|ry who were upon the right of Col. Carleton's corps. They were very &s;oon repul&s;ed, and the whole body di&s;|per&s;ed-before the army got up. They were about 6000 in number, chiefly militia mounted, with the regiments of Edinburgh dragoons, two companies of grenadiers, and many Spani&s;h officers. This morning Col. Howe, with two battalions of grenadiers, was &s;ent thro' the woods to the Moro, to reconnoitre, and &s;ecure the communication to that fort from the Coxemar.</P>
<P N="9">9<HI>th.</HI> Lord Albemarle marched the army from Guana|macoa, and encamped in the woods between the Coxemar and the Moro, leaving a corps at Guanamacoa, under the command of Lieut. General Elliot, to &s;ecure the avenues on that &s;ide, and a large tract of country, which could &s;up|ply the army with water, cattle, and vegetables. We now di&s;covered the enemy di&s;mantling their &s;hips in the har|bour, at the entrance of which they had laid a boom.</P>
<P N="10">10<HI>th.</HI> The Moro hill, called the Cavanno<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">, where the enemy were &s;aid to have a po&s;t well fortified, was recon|noitred: and in the evening Col. Carleton, with the light infantry and grenadiers from Coxemar, went and inve&s;ted that hill and the Moro fort.</P>
<P N="11">11<HI>th.</HI> Col. Carleton attacked the redoubt about one o' Clock in the afternoon, and carried it with very little lo&s;s, and little re&s;i&s;tance on the &s;ide of the enemy. Here was a po&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hed, and the work called by the name of the Spani&s;h redoubt.</P>
<P N="12">12<HI>th.</HI> The Moro fort was further reconnoitered by his lord&s;hip's order. It was difficult to reconnoitre it with
<PB N="5" REF="009165_0004_1030FD1930ACFBB8">
much accuracy, it being &s;urrounded with thick bru&s;hy woods, which could not be &s;een through, and we<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters"> mo&s;tly impo&s;&s;ible. It was ob&s;erved the parapet was thin, and all of ma&s;onry, and it was threfore judged advi&s;eable to erect a battery again&s;t it, as near as the cover of the woods would admit of; there was accordingly a plan fixed upon, at a|bout 250 yards di&s;tance, and preparations were accordingly made, and parties ordered out for fa&s;cines, and collecting earth, which was a work of great labour, the &s;oil being ex|ceedingly thin and &s;carce. The landing of the &s;tores was, at the &s;ame time, carried on with great dilligence by the fleet.</P>
<P N="13">13<HI>th.</HI> The battery mentioned ye&s;terday was begun, as al&s;o a howitzer battery beyond the Spani&s;h redoubt, to re|move the &s;hipping further off up the river. They threw a great deal of random fire into the woods, and annoyed us very much. Col. Howe, with 300 light infantry, and two battalions of grenadiers, was detached to land at Cho|rera, about 7 miles to the We&s;tward of the town, to &s;ecure a footing, and engage &s;ome part of the enemy's attention upon that &s;ide.</P>
<P N="19">19<HI>th.</HI> There was a mortar battery begun upon the right near the &s;ea, for one 13 inch, and fourteen royal mortars.</P>
<P N="20">20<HI>th.</HI> Parallels put in the woods to the right and left battery, and a fa&s;cine line begun, to &s;ecure the guards from the enemy's fire.</P>
<P N="23">23<HI>d.</HI> Another battery made upon the beach, to advance the royals in the battery on the 19th, nearer the fort.</P>
<P N="24">24<HI>th.</HI> A battery for two howitzers begun near the lime kiln; likewi&s;e again&s;t the &s;hipping, to remove them fur|ther up the harbour, which had its effect.</P>
<P N="25">25<HI>th.</HI> A battery for a 13 inch mortar begun near the lime kiln, again&s;t the &s;hipping.</P>
<P N="26">26<HI>th.</HI> A battery begun again&s;t the fort for four guns and two mortars, upon the left of the fir&s;t battery.</P>
<P N="29">29<HI>th.</HI> The enemy, at day break, landed two detach|ments of 500 men each, of grenadiers and cho&s;en men, with a detachment of armed Negroes and Mulattoes, with each corps, one upon the right under the Moro, the other
<PB N="6" REF="009165_0005_1030FD1C61012478">
upon the left of the lime kiln. The picquets and advanc|ed po&s;ts, prevented the &s;ucce&s;s of the&s;e detachments, by repul&s;ing them, killing, and taking near 200, be&s;ides wounding a great number of them, who mo&s;tly got of by the favour of the woods. Our lo&s;s was only ten men killed and wounded.</P>
<P N="30">30<HI>th.</HI> This day was chiefly taken up in carrying ammu|nition and carriages to the &s;everal batteries to provide for their opening next morning, which was done by the &s;old|iers and 500 Blacks purcha&s;ed by Lord Albemarle, at Martineco and Antigua, for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>July</HI> 1. This morning we opened two batteries of can|non, which, with our mortars, made up a fire as follows, viz.

<P>The enemy's fire exceded ours upon the front at|tacked, in the number of guns, which amounted to 16 or 17 from 6 to 12 pounders. They played one mor|tar of 8 inches, and that very &s;eldom. Upon the whole, we reckoned our fire &s;uperior to theirs con&s;iderably, be|&s;ides the difference of the &s;ecurity of our works, theirs being only a parapet of thin ma&s;onry.</P>
<P>About ten o'clock the Cambridge of 80 guns, the Dra|gon of 74, and the Marlborough of 66 went in and lay again&s;t the fort; the Cambridge lay within grape &s;hot. They continued firing for above three hours, which the fort received and returned with great &s;teadine&s;s: At length the &s;hips were ordered off. The Cambridge and Dragon &s;uffered much, particularly the former. The attacked front of the fort did not &s;eem to &s;uffer much from their fire, it was &s;o much above them; but they
<PB N="7" REF="009165_0006_1030FD1DEC0349C8">
&s;till did us a con&s;ideaable &s;ervice in taking up the enemy's attention for that time, which gained us a &s;uperiority in the number of guns.</P>
<P N="2">2<HI>d.</HI> Our batteries continued their fire with great &s;uc|ce&s;s, and beat down the front attacked, as fa&s;t as could be wi&s;hed or expected, particularly the eight gun bat|tery; but unhappily about noon, we were obliged to &s;lacken, that battery being in danger of catching fire, from the con&s;tant fire kept up, and the dryne&s;s of the fa&s;cines, having had no rain for 14 days; however, be|fore the evening, the enemy's fire was reduced to two guns, which fired but &s;eldom.</P>
<P N="3">3<HI>d.</HI> We flattered our&s;elves the fire was quite out, but about two in the morning it broke out again with great violence. Both water and people were &s;ent as fa&s;t as po&s;|&s;ible, but unhappily too late; the fire had in&s;inuated it&s;elf where water could not reach it, nor earth &s;tifle it. Thus 17 Days labour of 5 or 600 Men, and which mu&s;t have let us into the fort in a few days, was now baffled, and to do over again. There was another embrazure added this night to William's battery.</P>
<P N="4">4<HI>th</HI> and 5<HI>th.</HI> The&s;e two nights our endeavours &s;till continued to extingui&s;h, and with much difficulty, there were two embrazures &s;aved upon the right, and the e|paulment for mortars upon the left. The fire of the&s;e two embrazures was continued until the guns was di&s;a|bled, and two mortars &s;erved en barbette, until the enemy's fire obliged the men to give it up. It was now determined to convert the mortar battery, in the left parallel, into a battery for cannon, which according|ly begun, with &s;ome improvements to the other works, which the enemy's fire from the town, Fort la Punta, &s;hips of war, and floating batteries, had render'd nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P N="6">6<HI>th.</HI> Two more embrazures were added this night to Williams's battery, and a place fixed upon near the &s;tone redoubt for another battery of four guns.</P>
<P N="9">9<HI>th.</HI> This morning we had 12 guns in battery, viz. Williams's battery of &s;even guns, and the left parallel of five guns, be&s;ides our mortars. The enemy fired with about eight or nine.</P>
<P N="10"><PB N="8" REF="009165_0007_1030FD1F77846700">10<HI>th.</HI> At night a battery of four guns begun in the right parallel.</P>
<P N="11">11<HI>th.</HI> This morning the four gun battery, near the &s;tone redoubt, and two guns upon the &s;aved part of the grand battery newly repaired, opened and played with &s;ucce&s;s. We now had 18 guns in play to 8 or 9, which the enemy &s;till kept up; for, by their uninterrupted communication with the town, and the great a&s;&s;i&s;tance of their &s;ailors, who &s;erve their guns, they always made the lo&s;&s;es of the day good at night. This afternoon two guns in the left parallel battery failed, one by running, the other by cracking; the carriages of a third was di&s;abled upon Williams's battery. In the after|noon the merlons of the grand battery again caught fire, and extended from right to left, and the whole was ir|reparably con&s;umed.</P>
<P N="12">12<HI>th.</HI> The di&s;abled guns in the left parallel, and in Williams's battery were replaced la&s;t night, &s;o that we &s;till had 16 guns in play: Towards noon the carriages of the three guns in the &s;tone redoubt battery were di&s;abled.</P>
<P N="13">13<HI>th.</HI> This morning there was a battery of four 32 pounders opened on the right parallel again&s;t the left ba&s;|tion, and made con&s;iderable havock. There was ano|ther battery of four guns ordered to be made upon the right of it as &s;oon as materials can be collected. The ruins of the burnt battery was ordered to be converted into a line for mu&s;quetry at the &s;ame time. There were two guns remounted in the night upon the bat|tery near the &s;tone redoubt, but there were two more di&s;mounted immediately afterwards.</P>
<P N="14">14<HI>th.</HI> The four guns in the &s;tone redoubt battery were la&s;t night mounted on &s;ea-carriages: We now had 20 guns mounted again&s;t five or &s;ix, which the enemy began with in the morning: They were reduced to two before dark. The whole front attacked appeared in a mo&s;t ruinous condition, yet the enemy, tho' kept in a con&s;tant hurry and confu&s;ion, behaved with &s;pirit.</P>
<P>Preparations for carrying on approaches had now been in hand &s;ome days. The 40th regiment was employed
<PB N="9" REF="009165_0008_10303239AF48EB60">
in making gabions, and &s;everal men of war in making junk, blinds, or mantelets, and &s;ome bales of cotton pur|cha&s;ed to &s;erve as wool-packs. As our approaches mu&s;t be entirely rai&s;ed above ground on account of rocks, the&s;e precautions were nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P N="15">15<HI>th.</HI> We played with the &s;ame number of guns as ye&s;terday. The enemy fired in the morning with 6 or 7 guns, but were totally &s;ilenced before night.</P>
<P N="16">16<HI>th.</HI> Our fire as ye&s;terday. The enemy fired in the morning with two guns, and only twice with each. They fired the re&s;t of the day with mu&s;quetry and wall-pieces, but not much with either. This evening the ma|terials for the approaches began to be advanced. The guns and ammunition are carrying up for the new bat|tery, which is to open to-morrow morning. The ene|my &s;eemed to be employed in making up fre&s;h merlons upon the face of the right ba&s;tion.</P>
<P N="17">17<HI>th.</HI> The Valiant's battery opened this morning be|tween 10 and 11; the enemy had no fire on the front attacked, but fired two guns from the left face of the left Ba&s;tion upon Williams's battery, and up along the Ca|vannos. This afternoon we began to &s;tuff Gabions with Fa&s;cines for advancing our Sap. In the evening our Sap was begun, but there being a thick thorny wood to cut through, was advanced but a little way.</P>
<P N="18">18<HI>th.</HI> The enemy's fire this morning was the &s;ame as ye&s;terday. We had two howitzers put in Dixon's bat|tery to fire into the breaches; the Sap was carried on this night about two thirds of the way to the &s;mall bat|tery at the foot of the Sorties before the right Ba&s;tion. There was likewi&s;e a &s;mall lodgement made at the edge of the wood, before the point of the we&s;t Ba&s;tion.</P>
<P N="19">19<HI>th.</HI> The enemy fired this morning with three guns from the front attacked, but they were &s;oon &s;ilenced. About noon we took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the covered way, be|fore the point of the right Ba&s;tion, and the former Sap carried on at night, and another begun along the cover|ed way before the right face, where we made a lodgment.</P>
<P N="20">20<HI>th.</HI> This morning the miners were entered under
<PB N="10" REF="009165_0009_1030FD21581859A8">
the right or &s;ea face of the right Ba&s;tion, the only place Where there was a practicability of doing it, at the foot of the wall, for the ditch of the front attacked is 70 feet deep from the edge of the Counter&s;carp, and upwards of 40 feet, of that depth, &s;unk in the Rock, but fortunately there was a thin ridge of the Rock left at the point of the Ba&s;tion, to cover the extremity of the ditch from being open to the &s;ea, and to prevent &s;urprizes, and by means of this ridge the miner pa&s;t, with &s;ome difficulty, to the foot of the wall, which he could do no where el&s;e without the help of Scaling Ladders, an operation which would be both tedious and dangerous. This ridge was &s;o narrow that there was no po&s;&s;ibility of covering a pa&s;|&s;age upon it, from the fire of the oppo&s;ite flank, but we took our chance, and were glad to find it, even with that di&s;advantage. It co&s;t us but only three or four men during the whole time. We began the &s;ame after|noon to &s;ink a Shaft without the covered way, for mines to throw the Counter&s;carp into the ditch to fill it up in ca&s;e of occa&s;ion. We continued our Sap along the Glacis, and got a gun into the Saliant Angle of the co|vered way again&s;t the oppo&s;ite flank. In the day-time we had parties for making Fa&s;cines and other preparati|ons again&s;t the town, after the Moro &s;hould be taken.</P>
<P N="21">21<HI>&s;t.</HI> Our Sappers and Miners continued to carry on their work; in this they were much retarded, by meeting often with very large &s;tones, which co&s;t them much labour to remove. In the night there being a &s;u&s;picion that there were very few men in the Fort, there was a Serjeant and 12 men that &s;caled the &s;ea line a little to the right of the mine, and found only about nine or ten men a&s;leep in that part of the work: they wakened before our men got to them, and ran off immediately to alarm the re&s;t: the Ser|jeant and his party then came down, and being ordered up a &s;econd time, found they had taken the alarm, and a con|&s;iderable number a&s;&s;embled, and ready to make an oppo&s;i|tion. Had it been practicable to &s;uccour them bri&s;kly, the Fort might have been carried at that time, but the attempt was not to be repeated.</P>
<P N="22"><PB N="11" REF="009165_0010_1030FD27D72C01C0">22<HI>d.</HI> About four this morning there was a &s;ally made by the enemy from the town, which, by the information or pri&s;oners, amounted to 1500 men, divided into three different parties; one pu&s;hed up the bank behind the Shephard's battery; they were &s;topped for near an hour, by the guard po&s;ted there, con&s;i&s;ting only of about 30 men, commanded by Lieut. Col. Stuart, of the 90th regiment, until he was joined by about 100 &s;appers, and the 3d batt. of Royal Americans; the fire continued hot all the time; the enemy were then driven down the Bank with great &s;laughter; as many as could, got in their boats, and many leapt into the water, where there were 150 drowned. Another party endeavoured to pu&s;h up by the &s;aliant an|gle of the Moro to attack our Sappers upon the Glacis, and their Covering Party, but they were beat off in a very &s;hort time; the third party went up the Bank of the Spa|ni&s;h Redoubt, but finding our people ready to receive them, they returned very peaceably from whence they came. The alarm was entirely over, and our people re|turned to their work by eight o'clock. The enemy's lo&s;s was &s;aid to be near 400 men killed, drowned and taken; be&s;ides the wounded that got off. We had about 50 men killed and wounded. The enemy canonaded up mo&s;t vi|olently, when their troops were beat down the bank, from the Punta, We&s;t Ba&s;tion, and from the lines and flanks of the entrance, and from their &s;hipping; they even killed &s;ome of their own men, &s;o eager were they to kill us. At the &s;ame time that their troops wete attacking, we &s;aw they had great numbers paraded in the town, and &s;ome of them going into boats to &s;u&s;tain the attack; but when they perceived the rough treatment their comrades had met with, they prudently dropt the attempt.</P>
<P N="23">23<HI>d.</HI> The former works continue in hand, viz. Sap|ping, Mining, and making Fa&s;cines. This day a &s;ketch of the batteries again&s;t the town, and defences of the har|bour, to be erected along the cavannos after the Moro &s;hould be taken, were laid before the Earl of Albemarle, and approved of by his Lord&s;hip.</P>

collecting for a four gun battery, to the left of the Spa|ni&s;h redoubt, to be called &mdash; This battery to be opened again&s;t La Fuerza, and to enfilade the two next flanks, facing the entrance of the harbour. There was a party of 600 Negroes ordered this day for fa&s;cine making, and to be continued upon that &s;ervice, but they &s;eldom amounted to above half, or even a third of that number, occa&s;ioned by &s;ickne&s;s, and other pre&s;&s;ing duties.</P>
<P N="25">25<HI>th.</HI> The &s;ame work in hand as ye&s;terday. There was a road made from the rear of William's battery, up to the Spani&s;h redoubt, covered from the town, to &s;erve as a communication to the new de&s;igned batteries upon the Cavannos. This afternon there was a battery for five guns begun, to the right of the rear of Dixon's bat|tery, to open again&s;t the Punta. This battery is called &mdash;</P>
<P N="26">26<HI>th.</HI> The former works in hand, and the battery be|gun, to the left of Spani&s;h redoubt. This morning a two decked Merchant's frigate, acro&s;s the entrance be|fore the We&s;t Ba&s;tion, within the Boom, and near the &s;unk &s;hips, was &s;unk by a howitzer, near Dixon's battery; this &s;hip had annoyed us very much.</P>
<P N="27">27<HI>th.</HI> The former works in hand, and a mortar battery begun at a Spani&s;h redoubt; there was likewi&s;e a battery begun for three guns to fire upon boats landing at the Moro, which would have been of con&s;iderable u&s;e all a|long, if it could have been &s;erved without erecting other batteries to check the fire of the Moro it&s;elf, upon that &s;ide: But that could not be undertaken, as our troops were already &s;ufficiently employed in the works of the real attack. Brigadier Burton arrived with the fir&s;t of the troops from North America, and was ordered to the we&s;t &s;ide.</P>
<P N="28">28<HI>th.</HI> The former works in hand. This afternoon a large merchant &s;hip of the enemy's caught fire by light|ning within the Harbour, and blew up in ten minutes. At night there was a battery for two mortars begun to the right of the Spani&s;h redoubt: And one for five guns a|gain&s;t Fort La Punta upon the left of our Sap, near the point of the Moro.</P>
<P N="29"><PB N="13" REF="009165_0012_1030FD2CF8BD7B70">29<HI>th.</HI> The former works in hand. The mines were this day preparing for being &s;prung to-morrow morning.</P>
<P N="30">30<HI>th.</HI> About two this morning the enemy &s;ent two boats and a floating battery out of the Harbour, to fire into the ditch where our Mines were at work: They fired grape and &s;mall arms, but without any other effect, than a &s;hort interruption of the work: The covering party fired &s;o &s;martly upon them that they were obliged to retire: About two o'clock in the afternoon the mines were &s;prung; that, in the counter&s;carp had not a very con&s;iderable effect, but that in the Ba&s;tion having thrown down a part of both faces, made a breach, which the Ge|neral and Chief Engineer thought practicable; upon which the troops under orders for the a&s;&s;ault, were or|dered to mount, which they did, with the greate&s;t re&s;o|lution; and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">rming very expeditiou&s;ly upon the top of the breach, &s;oon drove the enemy from every part of the ramparts: The Spaniards had about 130 men, with &s;everal officers, killed; about 400 threw down their arms, and were made pri&s;oners; the re&s;t were either killed in boats or drowned in attempting to e&s;cape to the Havannah. Our lo&s;s in this glorious affair, amounted to two officers killed, and about 30 men killed and wounded.</P>
<P N="31">31<HI>&s;t.</HI> Our preparations were carried on with all po&s;|&s;ible diligence, for erecting the intended batteries upon the Cavannos. The enemy's fire continued very hot a|gain&s;t the Moro; they pointed chiefly at that part of the work where the ci&s;tern was, in hopes no doubt, of letting out the water. Lord Albemarle went this evening to the we&s;t &s;ide of the town to reconnoitre the ground there, and &s;ee in what manner attacks might be carried on with advantage on that &s;ide, in ca&s;e of occa&s;ion.</P>
<P><HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 1<HI>&s;t.</HI> The enemy's fire &s;till continued again&s;t the Moro. This evening General Keppel determined to erect the remainder of the batteries to be erected upon the Cavannos; &s;ome by the 1&s;t and 2d brigades, and &s;ome by the &s;ailors, and to begin them to-morrow night.</P>
<P N="2">2<HI>d.</HI> This morning, before day, the enemy, &s;ent down a 74 gun &s;hip into the Entrance, and moored her oppo&s;ite
<PB N="14" REF="009165_0013_1030FD337B240B90">
to the Fuerza; &s;he directed her fire likewi&s;e again&s;t the Moro: There were two howitzers run into the battery to fire at her, which incommoded her a good deal. The batteries mentioned ye&s;terday were begun this night, by the two brigades, and &s;ailors; they con&s;i&s;ted of thirty-five pieces of cannon.</P>
<P N="3">3<HI>d.</HI> The former works in hand, and carried on with diligence. This morning the Chief Engineer was order|ed to the we&s;tward of the town, to reconnoitre the ground, for attacking that &s;ide in ca&s;e of occa&s;ion. This evening the enemy's &s;hip oppo&s;ite to the Fuerza, menti|oned ye&s;terday, was removed by our howitzers, with a good deal of confu&s;ion.</P>
<P N="4">4<HI>th.</HI> The chief Engineer reported to Lord Albemarle, that as the Moro, was now in our po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, there was, to the we&s;tward of the town, a very advantageous attack to be formed again&s;t the poligons next the Punta, by the cover of a bank running along &s;hore from the Lazaro to Fort la Punta, &s;uppo&s;ing that fort &s;ilenced: That there was a road upon the bank which was, for a con|&s;iderable way, covered both from Fort la Punta and every part of the town, that the road was at pre&s;ent &s;topped up by trees felled on each &s;ide, but might be ea&s;ily clear|ed; but as attacks upon that ground would in &s;ome de|gree &s;tand in the line of fire of our batteries upon the op|po&s;ite &s;ide, it would be mo&s;t advi&s;eable to delay them until the&s;e batteries had in &s;ome mea&s;ure effected their de|&s;ign; and e&s;pecially, as they might of them&s;elves, per|haps, an&s;wer the end without further trouble.</P>
<P N="5">5<HI>th.</HI> The works and batteries on the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 words"> in hand as before, and &s;ome of the platforms begun to be laid: It was now difficult to get materials for that pur|po&s;e, tho&s;e from England and Martinico being expend|ed; but by the Admiral's a&s;&s;i&s;tance, the materials were got. Lord Albemarle took up his head quarters this evening the other &s;ide.</P>
<P N="6">6<HI>th.</HI> The works in hand as ye&s;terday, and being con|&s;iderably advanced, and the men much fatigued, there was none allowed for this night.&mdash;There was 30 car|penters
<PB N="15" REF="009165_0014_1030FD36D797DF08">
from the provincial troops, lately arrived, now employed in making platforms. There was a command of Engineers, and a proportion of entrenching tools or|dered to the we&s;t road, the former to go as &s;oon as the batteries and works on the ea&s;t &s;ide &s;hould be ready, and the tools to be &s;hipped immediately: The chief en|gineer was ordered to repair to that &s;ide, and there re|main.</P>
<P N="7">7<HI>th.</HI> The former works upon the ea&s;t &s;ide were going on, and Fa&s;cine parties ordered to work on the we&s;t &s;ide.</P>
<P N="8">8<HI>th.</HI> The former works in hand on the ea&s;t &s;ide, but Fa&s;cine-making was retarded con&s;iderably on the we&s;t-&s;ide for want of tools. This afternoon the &s;hip arrived on the we&s;t-&s;ide with the intrenching tools, but the &s;hip being very sickly, there were none landed. In the evening Lord Albemarle went him&s;elf to reconnoitre the road and ground between the Lazaro and the Punta, and ordered &s;ome po&s;ts to be taken up farther advanced.</P>
<P N="9">9<HI>th.</HI> The intrenching tools were landed this day, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the men of war, in the afternoon. The enemy having di&s;covered our reconnoitring towards the Punta for &s;ome days pa&s;t, &s;et &s;ome hou&s;es near the road on fire to prevent their being a &s;helter for us. In the evening there was a party of 200 men ordered to make a redoubt upon the roads to the Punta, with a co|vering-party of the &s;ame number; the place intended for the redoubt, which was partly upon the road, being much encumbered, as mentioned before, all they could do was to clear off the trees, and form an Abbates in the front and flanks for pre&s;ent defence.</P>
<P N="10">10<HI>th.</HI> At day break this morning the enemy having di&s;covered the covering party, and &s;u&s;pected our hav|ing been at work, began to cannonade along the road pretty warmly, but with little execution. About ten in the morning, our batteries being ready to open on the ea&s;t &s;ide, and we to open ground on the we&s;t &s;ide, Lord Albemarle &s;ent a flag of truce by an Aid de Camp to acquaint the Governor with the ruin that threatened the place, and &s;ummoned them to capitulate. The

Governor after keeping the flag from till between three and four in the afternoon, in the open fields, at &s;ome hundred yards di&s;tance from the works, &s;ent him back, and before he got two thirds of the way, began to fire: we at the &s;ame time &s;aw many people leaving the town with loads; in the evening there was a party &s;ent to car|ry on the works as before.</P>
<P N="11">11<HI>th.</HI> At day break this morning, all our batteries opened con&s;i&s;ting of 43 pieces of cannon, and 8 mortars. The advantage of po&s;ition, as well as &s;uperior fire, be|came vi&s;ible very &s;oon. Fort Punta was &s;ilenced between nine and ten. The north ba&s;tion almo&s;t, in about an hour afterwards; but now and then fired a &s;hot. Be|tween 1 and 2 we di&s;covered a great number of the ene|my running off from the Punta, as if they had aban|doned it. About two o'clock there were flags of truce hung out all round the garri&s;on, and on board the Ad|miral's &s;hip: &s;oon after, there arrived a flag of truce at our head quarters, by Don&mdash;Fort Major, his &s;on, and an interpreter, which proved to be with propo&s;als for a capitulation. Sir George Pocock was then &s;ent for, and the bu&s;ine&s;s entered upon, as &s;oon as he came. The works were &s;topt for this night, and the flag re|turned about du&s;k.</P>
<P N="12">12<HI>th.</HI> The truce continued. This day the flag was &s;ent in, and returned; and &s;ent in again in the evening. The works were ordered to be carried on as before, which gave room to expect the ho&s;tilities were to be re|newed in the morning; but the capitulation was &s;ettled before that time.</P>
<P N="13">13<HI>th.</HI> This day the capitulation was &s;igned and &s;eal|ed; the long time it took to be &s;ettled, is &s;aid to be ow|ing to an unrea&s;onable earne&s;tne&s;s in the enemy to &s;ave their &s;hipping, which they at length gave up.</P>
<P N="14">14<HI>th,</HI> About ten this morning, General Keppel with &mdash;men, took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Fort la Punta, and about noon, of the Punta gate and ba&s;tion, at both which places there were Briti&s;h colours hoi&s;ted, having been eva|cuated by the enemy. Brigadier Howe took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the land gate, with two battalions of grenadiers, much about the &s;ame time,</P>
