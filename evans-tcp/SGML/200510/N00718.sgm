<P>Had the <HI>Authors</HI> of the <HI>Libel I</HI> am now to an&s;wer, been &s;o ju&s;t to me and the <HI>World,</HI> as to have &s;ent their <HI>Names</HI> along with it, it might have &s;aved me much, if not all, of this Labour; they having (especially of late) &s;o &s;ignalized them&s;elves, by divers memorable actions, that hardly any whom fame hath reached with the knowledge thereof, will he&s;itate in giving them their <HI>Character,</HI> and I think it not a little to my reputation, that mine and theirs are &s;o diffe|rent. And though IOHN TATHAM, THOMAS REVELL and NATH. WEST-LAND did at la&s;t, when I had &s;taged the <HI>Author</HI>' or <HI>Authors</HI> for Forgery and Fal&s;hood, come forth, and own them&s;elves the <HI>Authors,</HI> yet their <HI>Libel</HI> being before disper&s;ed without a name, and mighty fall into &s;ome hands, who were Strangers both to the <HI>things</HI> and <HI>Per|&s;ons,</HI> I find it nece&s;sary to pur&s;ue it with this. What induced the&s;e angry <HI>Coun&s;ellours,</HI> to fall upon me in this <HI>Boori&s;h</HI> manner, at this time, is plain, from the burthen of their <HI>Complaint</HI>; That the <HI>Authority</HI> which they have a&s;&s;umed is not <HI>recognized,</HI> which I know is a great vexation to men of their temper and circum&s;tances, who&s;e ambition is to rule, and their lei&s;ure from other employments &s;uch, as may be a temptation to them, like <HI>Locu&s;ts</HI> to live upon other Mens labours: To wich I having &s;hewn &s;ome aver&s;ion, they there|by fondly take an occa&s;ion to magnifie my <HI>Intere&s;t</HI> with others, to an exce&s;&s;ive extream, and make me <HI>Author</HI> of all

the <HI>Interruptions</HI>&punc; and <HI>affronts</HI> they have me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> with, in the exerci&s;e of their <HI>&s;h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">m Authority.</HI> My &s;hare of it I am wil|ling to own; but not to exclude others, to whom for their fidelity to their <HI>Country,</HI> belongs a &s;hare of that regard, that<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s due to men, that will not ba&s;ely and meanly truckle, to any pretentions, where <HI>Royal Authority</HI> is wanting: For which rea&s;on the two la&s;t <HI>General A&s;&s;emblys</HI> of this <HI>Provin|ce,</HI> have not thought fit to recognize the <HI>Authority</HI> by which the&s;e men act; and how far they have approved them&s;elves true men and Friends to their <HI>Country,</HI> who have oppo&s;ed their Private &s;en&s;e, to the declared &s;en&s;e of the <HI>Province</HI> by their <HI>Repre&s;entatives,</HI> will (I hope) in a little time be more fully di&s;covered, and rewarded according to its due demerit. Let this &s;uffice for an <HI>Introduction,</HI> I &s;hall now proceed, to touch upon the &s;everall parts of their <HI>Libel,</HI> as it lyes before me in order, and begin fir&s;t with what they call, and would have the World to believe, to be the <HI>A|w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rd.</HI></P>
<P>That there was &s;uch a thing as a Difference, betwixt <HI>Edward Billing</HI> on the one part, and the <HI>Proprietors</HI> and <HI>In|habitants</HI> of <HI>We&s;t-Jer&s;ey</HI> on the other, is certain; which they have mi&s;repre&s;ented in their <HI>T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">le-Page,</HI> and render it to lye betwixt <HI>Edward Billing</HI> on the one part, and &s;ome <HI>We&s;t-Jer|&s;ians</HI> headed by me on the other part, Whence I can not but ob&s;erve, that when they have a mind to reproach me, they'l make me as big as a <HI>Province,</HI> that they may load me with the blame of a <HI>Province,</HI> and pre&s;ently (to &s;erve their own turn) confine me again, to &s;uch narrow limits, as may render me very dimin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tive; but when they have &s;aid and done all they can, <HI>By the grace of God, I am what I am,</HI> 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 15.10.

at that time their <HI>Governour,</HI> which made the other Party, who accordingly commi&s;&s;ionated me and <HI>Thomas Budd,</HI> to go to <HI>England,</HI> to negotiate their affairs there with <HI>Billing, Georg Hutche&s;on</HI> at the &s;ame time offering him&s;elf as a <HI>Vo|lunteer,</HI> to our a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Pur&s;uant to our <HI>Commi&s;&s;ion</HI> and <HI>In&s;tructions,</HI> we proceeded in the <HI>Voyage,</HI> and by the Grace of GOD, arrived in a good and &s;hort time a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> our <HI>Port</HI>; and when we came there, meeting with <HI>Billing,</HI> we imparted our bu&s;ine&s;s to him, which was, in the name of the <HI>Proprie|tors,</HI> to make a demand of the <HI>Government,</HI> to whom he had as much &s;old it as the <HI>Soil,</HI> and taken their mony for it. This me&s;&s;age was very ungrateful to him, who re&s;olved (as the con&s;equence hath &s;hewn) to cheat us, in what we e&s;teemed the be&s;t part of our bargain; For at that time, the <HI>Soil,</HI> without the <HI>Government,</HI> would have been of no value to the <HI>Purcha&s;ers.</HI> And though before our arrival, he was the great <HI>Complainant,</HI> and threatned high what he would do, if his <HI>Authority</HI> &s;hould be di&s;puted, yet finding now, that it was like to come to that indeed (for &s;o were we in|&s;tructed, viz. if he refu&s;ed to comply with our ju&s;t demands, to complain again&s;t him at <HI>White-Hall or We&s;tmin&s;ter-Hall,</HI> as able <HI>Coun&s;ell</HI> &s;hould advi&s;e) and fearing nothing more than his, and well knowing, that his Actions could not abide &s;o &s;evere a <HI>Te&s;t,</HI> makes it his bu&s;ine&s;s with might and main to prevail with our <HI>Friends,</HI> to u&s;e their endeavours, to take up this bu&s;ine&s;s, and make a more private end of it, if they could, or at lea&s;t, to prevent our procedure again&s;t him in the way we intended. Upon which a propo&s;all was made, by &s;ome of the <HI>Per&s;ons,</HI> who were afterwards <HI>Arbi|trators</HI>; That we would &s;ubmit the <HI>Controver&s;y,</HI> to the de|termination of a certain number of <HI>Per&s;ons,</HI> to be equally cho&s;en. To wich we replyed, we had no &s;uch power nor direction from our <HI>Principals,</HI> but were it &s;o it had affected us only, we &s;hould chearfully do it. They urged &s;ome rea&s;ons, which I &s;hall here omit to give, why it was not then a proper time to Pro&s;ecute &s;uch an affair, in the way we intended; But if it was not in our power, to &s;ubmit

the deci&s;ion wholly to them, in the name of the whole, yet we might do it on our own proper account: With which <HI>Thomas Budd</HI> fir&s;t clo&s;ed, and then I was di&s;abled, not having power to act alone, and therefore complied al&s;o; Although my compliance with this <HI>Propo&s;all,</HI> I mu&s;t declare, to be an Act of nece&s;&s;ity, and not of choice; and rhough I put an high value upon concord among&s;t <HI>Brethren,</HI> yet that relates chiefly to <HI>Religio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s</HI> concerns, and may be inviola<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ly maintained, notwith&s;tanding our different &s;entiments, in <HI>Civil</HI> affairs. Thus we &s;ubmitted, and they undertook to hear and determine our <HI>ca&s;e,</HI> which accordingly they did, and delivered the <HI>Award</HI> into my hands, the eleventh day of <HI>October</HI> 1684., where it hath remained ever-&s;ince, and &s;till is, being an <HI>Original</HI> and &s;igned with the <HI>Arbitrarors</HI> own hands. But finding a Printed thing &s;teal into the <HI>World</HI> with|out a name 'under the vi&s;or of the afore&s;aid <HI>Award,</HI> I took the Pains to compare them, and find at lea&s;t thirty eight varia|tions, &s;ome of which not being very material, I &s;hall pa&s;s by, and account them the act of the <HI>Pen man,</HI> in trying to correct and amend the &s;en<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e; who will hardly allow, that any man (at lea&s;t in the&s;e Parts) under&s;tands it like him|&s;elf. But others there are, that &s;eem to be de&s;ignedly and knavi&s;hly foi&s;ted in, of which nothing is to be found in the <HI>Award</HI>; Which wen I had con&s;idered' I Publi&s;hed a few lines in <HI>Manu&s;cript,</HI> declaring; That what was publi&s;hed in print as the <HI>Award,</HI> was <HI>Spurious and fal&s;e</HI>; Which oc|ca&s;ioned the Publi&s;hing of divers in that manner on each &s;ide, with which I &s;hall not much meddle now, except to touch a little upon their la&s;t Paper, the re&s;t being already an&s;we|red.</P>
<P>I come now to give &s;ome Particular In&s;tances of their <HI>For|gery and Fal&s;ehood,</HI> and begin with Page 3., where they make the <HI>Award</HI> to &s;paek thus:
<Q>That whereas S. <HI>Jenings</HI> and the A&s;&s;embly in <HI>We&s;t-Jar&s;ey</HI> had Po&s;itively acknowledged <HI>E. Billing</HI> as Governour, and acted about two years by vir|tue of his Commi&s;&s;ion and Power, and <HI>S. Jenings</HI> as his Deputy engaging to &s;erve him, and pre&s;erve his Intere&s;t in
<PB N="7" REF="000865_0006_0FABF35097B8F7B0">
that capacity; Now after all this they accepting <HI>E. Billing</HI> as Governour <HI>only in tru&s;t,</HI> as they alledge, in order to have him a&s;&s;ign his Power and Government to the People; which not being obtained with his con&s;ent, <HI>then they re|jecting him the &s;aid</HI> Billing, <HI>and chu&s;ing S.</HI> Jenings <HI>Gover|nour in his &s;tead, and his accepting thereof,</HI> WAS A BE|TRAYING HIS TRUST; as al&s;o rejecting <HI>W.

Jenings <HI>and all Per&s;ons concerned therein.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Here I charge my <HI>Adver&s;aries</HI> with downright FORGE|RY and FALSHOOD, there being no &s;uch words in the whole <HI>Award</HI>; as <HI>betraying of tru&s;t,</HI> of which they &s;eemed &s;o fond, &s;uiting their malicious de&s;ign &s;o well, that to give it the greater <HI>Empha&s;is,</HI> they put it in Capitall Letters; But being now discovered, and their Forgery detected, &s;erves only to render them Capitall in malice and abu&s;e: Nor doth it excu&s;e them to &s;ay, as in one of their Papers they do,
<Q>That not any thing is couched in the &s;aid Printed Award; no not even that noted reflection upon <HI>Samuel</HI> in Capital letters, but what we will prove to be true, when occa&s;ion &s;hall require &amp;c.</Q>
But this is &s;till to do, and this I leave as a task upon them to perform, when they &s;hall think the occa|&s;ion requireth. I am glad I am &s;o much before hand with them, having Proved my charge again&s;t them before &s;eve|rall credible Witne&s;&s;es, who for their private &s;atisfaction, have compared what they have Printed, with the true <HI>A|ward,</HI> and (I believe) will not refu&s;e to give evidence, to the truth of what I here a&s;&s;ert, if it be de&s;ired; and I do here|by further promi&s;e, to give the like &s;atisfaction, to as ma|ny as &s;hall &s;oberly reque&s;t it. But, &s;ay they,
<Q>The <HI>Award</HI> now Publi&s;hed,&mdash;as received from their [the <HI>Awarders</HI>] hands, &s;o was tran&s;mitted hither for information, and is by us made publick, for the &s;ame end, without the lea&s;t variati&mdash;on. And is it more rea&s;onable to relie upon his vera|city,
<PB N="8" REF="000865_0007_0FABF3512F1EBE80">
in this matter, than the worth and reputation of tho&s;e honourable <HI>Gentleman</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> that &s;ent it hither verbatim as We have Publi&s;hed it &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P>Thereby implying as if the <HI>Award</HI> they have Printed is of equal force and validity with the other. To which I an|&s;wer, Theirs can be but a <HI>Copy,</HI> as appears by its date, being four daies after the <HI>Originals</HI> were delivered into the hands of the <HI>Parties</HI> concerned, and therefore not of equal credit with the <HI>Original</HI>: But my bu&s;ine&s;s is not to con&s;ider what it is, nor how they come by it; my complaint and charge is That they have Printed and publi&s;hed to the World, in the name of eight of my Friends, a thing called their <HI>Award,</HI> with <HI>divers Additions, Omi&s;&s;ions and Variations,</HI> and that <HI>in divers of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable pa&s;&s;ages in it,</HI> tending greatly to &s;lander and reproach me. and this I call <HI>Forgery and Fal&s;hood,</HI> and &s;hall leave it upon them, till they can more fairly throw it of, than yet they have done.</P>
<P>And again in page 3, where they &s;ay:
<Q>The&s;e we judge Irregular proceedings, unfair and unwarrantable, un&s;afe and worthy of Blame in <HI>S. Jenings</HI> and all Per&s;ons concerned therein.</Q></P>
<P>There is no mention made of <HI>S. Jenings,</HI> nor any blame laid upon him, but in conjunction with the <HI>A&s;&s;embly,</HI> who are Blamed for chu&s;ing, and he for accepting their choice of him for <HI>Governour.</HI> But I am glad of this oppretunity, to clear that point, which I doubt not to do, to the &s;atisfaction of any indifferent per&s;on; and to acquit my &s;elf, and the <HI>A&s;&s;embly</HI> too, from any ju&s;t blame upon that occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>But here I expect to meet with an <HI>Objection,</HI> viz. But why then did your <HI>Friends</HI> blame you in their <HI>Award,</HI> and were not they <HI>Divinely</HI> in&s;pired in what they did? I an&s;wer; Be|cau&s;e I find my <HI>Adver&s;aries</HI> harp &s;o much upon that, and make &s;uch a perver&s;e, or rather malicious u&s;e of it; I put it upon them to prove, when ever our <HI>Friends</HI> have placed their Conduct in <HI>Civil</HI> affairs, &s;o high; No, we can very well admitt of different &s;entiments in tho&s;e things, without any braech of <HI>Religious</HI> union; and this being partly a <HI>Law-ca&s;e,</HI>
<PB N="9" REF="000865_0008_0FABF351F086DDE8">
upon which the judgement of the&s;e <HI>Friends</HI> was groun|ded, it is not utterly impo&s;&s;ible, but they might be &s;ome|what mi&s;taken in it: However, it &s;hould have lain un|toucht for me, had not I thus unexpectedly, as well as un|fairly been a&s;&s;aulted afre&s;h, and recriminated by the Award. But to meet with this from any <HI>Members</HI> of <HI>We&s;t-Jer&s;ey,</HI> that would be thought to be tender of her <HI>Rights</HI> and <HI>Prive|ledges,</HI> for the &s;ake of which I &s;uffered what I did, in de|fence of them, is very &s;trange; e&s;pecially con&s;idering how much I was importuned, and in a &s;ence forced, for the pre|&s;ervation of the Peace of the <HI>Province,</HI> into a compliance; which I &s;hould think, cannot be forgotten by one of my <HI>Ad|ver&s;aries,</HI> at lea&s;t, who had not the lea&s;t &s;hare, in advis|ing what was done; from whom I did not expect &s;uch a re|turn, for former kindne&s;&s;es &s;hewed him, by me and others: Who in the time of his nece&s;&s;ity, enjoyed all the places of profit, that he was capable of in the Government, by the favour of tho&s;e, over whom he hath &s;ince made his in&s;ults; by which means, he hath ju&s;tly drawn upon him&s;elf, the hatefull <HI>Epithet</HI> of <HI>Ingratitude,</HI> a thing common to men of his temper, which having branded him with, at pre&s;ent I &s;hall leave him.</P>
<P>But to proceed, you may perceive by the <HI>Award,</HI> that the <HI>Agents</HI> of the <HI>Province,</HI> did alledge when in <HI>England,</HI>
<Q>That they accepted <HI>E. Billing</HI> as Governour <HI>only in Tru&s;t,</HI> in order to have him a&s;&s;ign his Power and Government to the People.</Q>
Which is all very true and rea&s;onable; for it was to &s;uch People, as had before bought and paid for it, and <HI>E- Billing</HI> him&s;elf, when he Fir&s;t obtained the grant from the <HI>Duke,</HI> endeavoured to make us believe, <HI>that he received it but in tru&s;t, and would u&s;e it no otherwi&s;e,</HI> and excu&s;es thae taking it in his own name, alledging, <HI>It mu&s;t he in a &s;ingle per&s;on, and he could not obtain it otherwi&s;e</HI> Which there was no rea&s;on to do, had he not been con&s;ci|ous to him&s;elf, that the right of it did appertain to others. And <HI>William Penn,</HI> one of <HI>E. Billings</HI> Tru&s;tees, of whom we bought, and well knew the Rights of the People, who&s;e
<PB N="10" REF="000865_0009_0FABF352B603AEB8">
Intere&s;t was the great means of obtaining the Grant of the <HI>Duke,</HI> alwaies declared; <HI>that he &s;olicited for it in the name of the People, that they might be able to make good what they had &s;old them.</HI> And <HI>Sir William Jones,</HI> on who&s;e opi|nion the <HI>Duke</HI> much relied, gave it as his opinion, <HI>that the Right belonged to the People</HI>; Upon which the <HI>Duke</HI> Frank|ly ordered, <HI>That a Second Grant &s;hould be given</HI>; The in|tent being only to confirm but not to de&s;troy the former. And la&s;tly, than which nothing can be more clear; The Second Grant, by which the powers of Government were more clearly granted to <HI>Billing,</HI> was never propo&s;ed to be &s;ought for, but at the reque&s;t and charge of the <HI>Proprie|tors</HI>; For, &s;aies <HI>Billing</HI> and &s;ome of his Tru&s;tees in a le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">er now in my hands, <HI>it will co&s;t much money to obtain it, and when gotten, you &s;hall have the benefit of it.</HI> This I think is enough to &s;ay for proof of this Point, though I could &s;ay a great deal more, but &s;hall u&s;e what brevity the ca&s;e will bear.</P>
<P><HI>Edward Billing</HI> having thus obtained the grant as aforesaid, &s;ends over a <HI>Commi&s;&s;ion</HI> to &s;everall per&s;ons, in which I was fir&s;t named, and in ca&s;e of mortality, the re&s;t to &s;ucceed in their order as <HI>Deputy Governours:</HI> Now to &s;hew with what caution this was accepted, and no otherwi&s;e, but vvith a <HI>&s;aving our Right,</HI> the <HI>Records</HI> of the fir&s;t <HI>Generall A&s;&s;embly</HI> held in <HI>We&s;t-Jer&s;ey</HI> will &s;hew. But before that <HI>A&s;&s;embly</HI> was called, I knowing it to be again&s;t the Rights of the People, for him to grant <HI>Commi&s;&s;ions,</HI> and a&s;&s;ume the place of a <HI>Go|vernour,</HI> I called together as many as I could, of the mo&s;t antient and con&s;iderable of the <HI>Inhabitants</HI> here, as &s;oon as I had received the <HI>Commi&s;&s;ion,</HI> and freely gave my &s;en&s;e of it, and told them; <HI>my re&s;olution was, never to impo&s;e it on them nor make any u&s;e of it, except they apprehended, it might be of &s;ervice to them:</HI> Upon which the thing was con&s;ide|red, debated, and at la&s;t concluded, <HI>that it was better, not wholly to reject the</HI> Commi&s;&s;ion; <HI>but to accept it as afore|&s;aid, that &s;ome face of</HI> Authority <HI>might be kept up, to a|void the confu&s;ions of an</HI> Anarchy.

<P>I have now &s;hown, why we received, and why We rejected <HI>Edw.

<P>I intend to touch upon one thing more in that <HI>Sham A|ward</HI> that my <HI>Adver&s;aries</HI> have Printed, and &s;o to leave it. It relates to the &s;econd Paragraph of the <HI>Award,</HI> page the 3d., at the clo&s;e of which they note in the name of I know not who, that
<Q>Whence (I &s;uppo&s;e it &s;hould be whereas) this &s;entence above cited was ha&s;tily razed out of the <HI>Original</HI> the 11 of 8 mo. 1684.

The de&s;ign of incerting this is ea&s;ily &s;een, to be to cover <HI>Billings</HI> head, from a &s;troke that otherwi&s;e would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">evita|bly have fallen upon him: For, knowing that the Right of the thing &s;ought for belonged to the People, which al&s;o is acknowledged in the <HI>Award,</HI> page the 2d. and 4th.; it could not but look ill in him, &s;o much as to take it in his own name, if it could have been otherwi&s;e obtained: But who&s;e judgement it is, that <HI>it were better and more clear, that that Sentence &s;hould be in&s;erted,</HI> I know not; for they have placed it under, and after the names of the Arbitra|tors, and I would hope, that it is none of their act, nor have I any rea&s;on to believe it to be &s;o, &s;ince I am &s;ure, there is nothing of it in that they delivered to me, and I am not willing to entertain a thought, that after the time

<Q>That by the <HI>Award</HI> of tho&s;e eminent <HI>Quakers</HI> (as he in &s;cornfully calls them&punc;) the Government was in <HI>Billing,</HI> and not in the People of <HI>We&s;t-Jar&s;ey.</HI></Q>
This is true, but the matter is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;o much, in whom it was, as in whom it ought to be: And this was the ground of our complaint again&s;t him, that he had abu&s;ed us, in taking it to him&s;elf, and detaining it from us. But I mu&s;t de&s;ire this <HI>Ob&s;ervator</HI> fur|ther to ob&s;erve, That though they did acknowledge it was in him, yet not right fully, and therefore they enjoyn him
<Q>To go &s;o far as he is able, and lawfully can do to their (viz the <HI>Proprietors</HI>) ju&s;t &s;atisfaction.</Q>
See <HI>The Ca&s;e put</HI> &amp;c. Page the 4th. And they give rea&s;ons for it, and great and va|lid ones too, as in the fir&s;t Paragraph page the 2d. viz
<Q>That <HI>E. Billing</HI> hath, by conce&s;&s;ions, &s;igned by him&s;elf, with other words and circum&s;tances, as al&s;o by Letters Written by <HI>Gawen Lowry, Nicholas Lucas &amp;c.</HI> to the <HI>Proprietors,</HI> given them ground to expect that they &s;hould

have and had the Government with the Soyl.</Q>
Here I confe&s;s <HI>Billing</HI> hath been too hard for us; for had We only given him an expectation on the con&s;ideration; as he did us of the Purcha&s;e, We had been of equall terms with him; and why not as much rea&s;on for the one, as the other. But to return. The fir&s;t rea&s;on the <HI>Arbitrators</HI> a&s;&s;ign for his doing as afore&s;aid, is, becau&s;e of the <HI>Conce&s;&s;ions</HI> made and <HI>Signed by him &s;elf,</HI> which were made the bait to catch buyers, and I believe few purcha&s;ed before they had &s;een them; which conce&s;&s;ions lodged the whole power of Govern|ment in the <HI>Generall A&s;&s;embly,</HI> and were to be &s;o inviolably ob&s;erved, <HI>that whoever &s;houd but attempt to break them, was to be deemed an Enemy to the peace and Priviledges of the</HI> Province: yea, &s;o &s;acred were they e&s;teemed, <HI>that if any refu&s;ed to &s;ign them, they were not to be admitted to the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of any Land, though before bought and paid for.</HI> Secondly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">couragement given by the Sell<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">s, in di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">vers letters <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> affirming, <HI>that they had the Govern|ment with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> and were ready to &s;ell, and make a good title to both</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">.

Thus it is evident, that the&s;e <HI>Awarders</HI> did grant, That though the Legal part of the Government was in <HI>Billing</HI>; yet, as they &s;uppo&s;ed, the equi|table part belonged to us, And though they &s;eemed to doubt, whether he could legally and &s;afely perform, to a Punctil|lio, all that he had given us an expectation of, <Q>yet (&s;ay they) We all agree, that he is thereby bound to perform to the <HI>Proprietors,</HI> &s;o far as he legally and &s;afely may do.

(What is this, but to dive&s;t him&s;elf &s;o far as he could, and inve&s;t the <HI>Proprietors</HI> with the Govern|ment: But I know they proceeded upon a notion, that this he could not &s;afely or legally do, wholly (which per|haps was a thing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">itter to have been argued by <HI>Lawyers</HI>) and

But before I have done with this, I mu&s;t give another in&s;tance, of the fidelity and greatne&s;s of the&s;e men; in wich I mu&s;t make a little digres|&s;ion, while I inform, or rather remind my <HI>Reader,</HI> That, the controver&s;y betwixt the <HI>Suce&s;&s;ours</HI> of <HI>Billing,</HI> and the <HI>Proprietors</HI> here, was never yet determined; which hath occa&s;ioned jarrs and mi&s;under&s;tandings, to be kept on foot betwixt them and us; to prevent which for the future, the&s;e <HI>great &s;ouls</HI> did agree, at the then <HI>Governours</HI> motion, together to write a per&s;wa&s;ive Letter to the <HI>Society,</HI> to grant us what we reque&s;ted, and believed was our right: This was performed, &s;igned by the <HI>Governour</HI> and his <HI>Council</HI> (of wich the&s;e men were a part) delivered in to the hou&s;e of <HI>Repre&s;entatives,</HI> to be &s;ent to <HI>England,</HI> and accordingly was &s;ent; Yet the&s;e very men, my pre&s;ent <HI>Adver&s;aries,</HI> &s;ent another privately about the &s;ame time, to di&s;swade the per&s;on that both they and we had addre&s;&s;ed, as afore&s;aid, from granting our re|que&s;t. Now what thinke&s;t thou, <HI>Reader,</HI> of the &s;ixe of the&s;e mens &s;ouls? Had they dealt thus with a private per|&s;on, it had been very dete&s;table; but to do it to a <HI>Pro|vince,</HI> is a thing &s;o unaccountable, I &s;hall leave it without

<P N="8">8thly <HI>Wether they or we have transgre&s;sed the</HI> Act <HI>of</HI> Par|liament <HI>as it is &s;ugge&s;ted we have done.</HI> This is &s;o plain a ca&s;e, that I &s;hall leave it to the deci&s;ion of my <HI>Reader,</HI> ha|ving &s;aid &s;o much already on this head: But if to cont<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">d for obedience to the requirings of the <HI>Act,</HI> be a Trans|gre&s;&s;ion of it, we will &s;ubmit to their charge.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, <HI>Their Indecency, after all their abu&s;es, to take upon them to act a</HI> Religious <HI>part.</HI> This puts me in mind of the old Proverb, viz <HI>When the Fox begins to preach, be|w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">re the gee&s;e.</HI> The be&s;t of it is, there is not many here, that much affect the <HI>Rel&iacute;gion</HI> of the&s;e men, but e&s;pecially that o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the <HI>Penn-man</HI>; if yet he may be &s;uppo&s;ed to have a|ny at all. But that nothing might be wanting, that fal&s;ehood and flattery could furni&s;h them withal, they pretend, that what they do, is, in tenderne&s;s to the people and inhabi|tants of the <HI>Province</HI> of <HI>We&s;t-New-Jar&s;ey</HI>; than which not|hing could be more remote from them, and is &s;o appa|rent, that I think none by the&s;e means will b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> deceived by them.</P>
<P>And now for <HI>Conclu&s;ion</HI>: I &s;hall (as I have promi&s;ed) touch a little upon the la&s;t paper the&s;e men po&s;ted again&s;t me; which I find &s;o full of &s;currility and railery - that I &s;carce know where to touch it without fouling my fingers. It doth indeed render them <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ters of</HI> their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, and the extravagancy of their abu&s;es to me in it are &s;uch, as makes it the le&s;s needfull for me to make any defence again&s;t it. For when any have &s;o debaucht-their tongues or pens, as to have no regard to the truth of what <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hey &s;ay or write, in&s;tead of blemi&s;hing tho&s;e with whom they con|tend, they brighten them, and only hit them&s;elves a box on the ear: For which rea&s;on, I can very contentedly be &s;ilent, to all the &s;corn, reproach and fal&s;ehood they would dis|gui&s;e me with; knowing that men of candour will &s;ee-for them&s;elves, and not be impo&s;ed upon by &s;uch notori|ous&punc; ungenerous and &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eaking <HI>Adver&s;aries.</HI></P>
<P>I perceive they are unea&s;y, that I &s;till in&s;i&s;t upon
<PB N="29" REF="000865_0028_0FABF36C43602A90" MS="y">
my charge of <HI>forgery</HI> again&s;t them, from which I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> never acquit them, nor will all their &s;huffling, wrigli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">, twi&s;ting and twining extricate them from the guilt of it. They a&s;k a que&s;tion of me, which I cannot an&s;wer viz "Did we receive or forge the <HI>Award?</HI> They might be guilty of the wor&s;t part of it, for ought I know: But as I have &s;aid before; it concerns not me to enquire how they came by it, but they printed and publi&s;hed it, forged as it is, and on whom &s;hould I charge the guilt of this foul act, but on them, the ju&s;tice of which, I leave to the cen&s;ure of my <HI>Reader.</HI></P>
<P>Their reflections upon tho&s;e judicious per&s;ons that I mentioned, whom they render <HI>Comical</HI>; and Ianus <HI>like with to faces each,</HI> I &s;hall not meddle with; knowing them to be &s;ufficiently able to make their own defence, if they think them&s;elves abu&s;ed by it.</P>
<P>I find they would have the world beleive, and there|fore &s;ay
<Q>They &s;olemnly declare [that what they have done] was not from any re&s;entment or disaffection to me, or any other particular per&s;on or per&s;ons.</Q>
To which I &s;hall not an&s;wer a word, but leave my <HI>Reader</HI> free, to judge of the truth of it upon peru&s;al. I judge, with the like &s;incerity they mention the <HI>Awarders,</HI> with a &s;hew of re&s;pect; which &s;erves only as a further di&s;covery of their hypocri&s;y, who have at times, &s;o freely expre&s;sed re&s;entments again&s;t <HI>Quakers</HI> in general.
But they proceed to point at othes: under the &s;ame denomination <Q>who for their Probity, Veracity, or other wi&s;e, co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">pared with them, will not appear better than &s;purious, a re|proach to the name, but as boils and botches to the body they hypocritically pretend to.</Q>
Here I am willing (though not for their merit) to &s;pare a little tho&s;e <HI>common tools</HI> who &s;igned along with the <HI>Pen-man</HI>; believing, that in reality they have been little more concerned, than the <HI>Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> that it<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s fabled&punc; the <HI>Monkey</HI> made u&s;e of the Paw of for hot &s;ervice<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to &s;ave his own.

<P>And here I &s;hould breake off and conclude, were it not that I am charged with <HI>murther</HI>; I am glad that the charge is no higher than <HI>murthering Engli&s;h and sen&s;e</HI>; better &s;o than to murther <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> in the wor&s;t <HI>sen&s;e.</HI> But here I mu&s;t tread &s;oftly, lea&s;t it revive old jealou&s;ies, and look to my own &s;afety; being threatned (though I hope it is not ominous) in the&s;e words.
