<HEAD>THE CASE OF THE CLERGY of <HI>MARYLAND.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IT appears from the Charter of <HI>Maryland,</HI> that the In|tent of that Grant, was to promote the Intere&s;t of the Prote&s;tant Religion in that Province:
For in the Pream|ble it is &s;aid, <Q>That the Proprietor was excited by a laudable and pious Zeal, for the Propagation of the Chri|stian Faith;</Q>
which mu&s;t be under&s;tood of the Faith as profe&s;&s;ed in the Church of <HI>England,</HI> becau&s;e the &s;ame Char|ter lays him under an Obligation,
<Q>to cau&s;e all Churches, Chappels and Oratories, to be dedicated and con&s;ecrated according to the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Laws of the Kingdom of <HI>Eng|land.</HI></Q></P>
<P>But &s;o it happened, that no Attempt was made for e&s;ta|bli&s;hing a Prote&s;tant Church or Clergy in that Province, un|til the Government thereof devolved into the Hands of the Crown, upon the happy Revolution under the glorious Reign of his Maje&s;ty King <HI>William</HI> III. At which time &s;ome Acts of A&s;&s;embly were propo&s;ed and pa&s;&s;ed, for &s;ettling the re|ligious Wor&s;hip of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> among&s;t his Ma|je&s;ty's Prote&s;tant Subjects in that Colony; but by Rea&s;on of &s;ome Defects, that appeared in the Draught of the &s;aid Acts, they were by the royal Authority repealed; and one other immediately prepared and tran&s;mitted to the Governour and A&s;&s;embly, by Direction of his &s;aid late Maje&s;ty in Council, which after pa&s;&s;ing the nece&s;&s;ary Forms abroad, received the royal Sanction here in the solemn Manner, &s;et forth in the Petition hereto annexed.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="039950_0002_10161FFA1BAD9A10">Thus relying on the Favour and Protection of the Crown, which in that Manner &s;o well &s;ecured a rea&s;onable Mainte|nance for the Clergy; many regular Divines by the pious Care of the Bishops of <HI>London</HI> from Time to Time were in|duced to go over and &s;ettle in that Province; not in the lea&s;t apprehending, it was in the Power of any Governour and A&s;&s;embly to break through &s;o firm an E&s;tabli&s;hment without the Concurrence of an equal Authority to that which first gave it a Being; <HI>viz.</HI> the royal Sanction.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s so it is, that on the third Day of <HI>October,</HI> 1728, an Act of A&s;&s;embly was pa&s;&s;ed in <HI>Maryland,</HI> under the Au|thority of the pre&s;ent Lord Proprietor's Deputy-Governour, whereby the afore&s;aid &s;olemn Act for the E&s;tabli&s;hment of the Clergy, is materially altered, and their future Support and Maintenance not only impair'd one fourth Part&punc; but the whole rendered precarious and &s;ubject to the fluctuating Hu|mour of their popular A&s;&s;emblies from Year to Year; as will be clearly under&s;tood by ob&s;erving the following Particulars.</P>
<P N="1">I. Whereas, by the first Act &s;o carefully drawn up and af|terwards pa&s;&s;ed into a Law by the royal A&s;&s;ent, the Clergy were intitled to receive, free of all Charge 40 <ABBR>lb.</ABBR> of Tobacco <HI>per</HI> Poll, on every taxable Person in <HI>Maryland,</HI> in lieu of Tythes; the late Act directs the said 40 <ABBR>lb.</ABBR> of Tobacco <HI>per</HI> Poll to be paid in current Money, at ten Shillings <HI>per</HI> hun|dred, which is but 7 <HI>s.</HI> 6 <HI>d.</HI> Sterl. or in Tobacco three fourths for the whole, at the Election of the Planter: So that when Tobacco ri&s;es in Value, the People will chu&s;e to pay the Clergy at an under-rate in Money, and when the Market falls below ten Shillings <HI>per</HI> hundred, they will pay in To|bacco three fourths for the whole; whereby in all Events, the Clergy mu&s;t be great Lo&s;ers by this Act, and have no manner of Chance with their Fellow-Subjects to &s;hare in the propo&s;ed Benefits of the Act, be what they will.</P>
<P N="2">II. This Uncertainty of the Species in which the Clergy is to be paid their Sub&s;i&s;tence, by this Act, is attended with another mo&s;t grievous Inconveniency, <HI>viz.</HI> In a Country like <HI>Maryland,</HI> where for want of a &s;ufficient Currency in ready Ca&s;h, the People mu&s;t deal by Barter, and on Credit for their Cloathing and other Nece&s;&s;aries of Life; if a Clergy|man agrees to purcha&s;e any thing of the Merchant for Money, perhaps the People, as has been &s;aid, will chu&s;e to pay his
<PB N="3" REF="039950_0003_10162634E04039C0">
Stipend in Tobacco, and then the poor Clergy-man mu&s;t be at the Will of the Merchant, how much Tobacco he will plea&s;e to accept of, for the Money due to him; and on the other hand, if an Agreement be made with the Merchant for Tobacco, if then the People happen to chu&s;e to pay that Year in Money, the Merchant will &s;till be at Liberty to &s;et his own Price on that Quantity of Tobacco, which by A|greement was due to him: So that whatever happens, the Clergy <HI>mu&s;t be certain Lo&s;ers,</HI> without a Po&s;&s;ibility of &s;hare|ing in any Advantage or Improvement that can be made in the Tobacco Trade.</P>
<P N="3">III. The Clergy are mo&s;t grievou&s;ly oppre&s;s'd by the Time limited in this late Act for collecting and paying their Al|lowance. For the People have to the tenth of <HI>April</HI> to make their Choice, whether they will pay in Money or Tobacco: and afterwards the Sheriff has to the la&s;t of <HI>June</HI> to make up his Accounts with the Clergy; by which Means it will often happen, that a Clergy-man may &s;erve three Years before he can reap the Benefit of his Labour. For until the first Year is ended (which commonly begins in <HI>November</HI>) there is nothing due; and if the Sheriff be allowed to keep their Tobacco till the la&s;t of <HI>June</HI> following, the Market will, in all Probability, be over; and the Tobacco lie on their hands until next Year; when if (as it frequently happens) they cannot &s;ell it, it mu&s;t be &s;hipped home for <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> and then it will be another Year, before they can expect any Returns. All which the Clergy conceive to be &s;uch Hard|&s;hips, that neither the pre&s;ent Sett, nor any who under the&s;e Circum&s;tances, may be unadvi&s;edly induced to &s;ucceed them, can po&s;&s;ibly &s;ub&s;i&s;t or continue in that Province.</P>
<P>It is further to be ob&s;erved, that &s;ome of the Clergy of <HI>Maryland</HI> petitioned the Honourable Council of that Province again&s;t the pa&s;&s;ing this Act; and the Council having thought fit to enter upon the Back of their Petition, &s;ome Rea&s;ons for pa&s;&s;ing it into a Law; it will be nece&s;&s;ary for the better Under&s;tanding of the whole Matter, to &s;ubjoin those Rea&s;ons given by the honourable Council in Ju&s;tification of their Pro|ceedings, with proper An&s;wers on behalf of the Clergy.</P>
<P N="1">I. The honourable Council are plea&s;ed to &s;ay, that the In|come or Provi&s;ion made for the Clergy is greatly advanced in Quantity, from what it was, when the Act for their E&s;tabli&s;hment was made.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="4" REF="039950_0004_10162637EFBC2760">II. That the De&s;ign of the Legi&s;lature in pa&s;&s;ing this &s;ub|&s;equent Act, was not to deprive the Clergy of any Advanta|ges that accrued to them by the former Law: But on the contrary, that their Intention was, by le&s;&s;ening the Quantity of Tobacco hereafter to be made in that Province, to ren|der three fourths of the Clergy's Allowance equal in value, to the whole of what was formerly levied for their Sub&s;i&s;tence.</P>
<P N="3">III. That the Wages allowed to the Members of Council and A&s;&s;embly, the Lawyers Fees, and all Debts due to and from the Inhabitants, are by this Act &s;ubject to the like Deductions, with that impo&s;ed on the Clergy.</P>
<P>To the fir&s;t, it is an&s;wered on behalf of the Clergy, That when the forty <HI>per</HI> Poll was &s;ettled by the fir&s;t Act, the Num|ber of People were then &s;o few, that it did &s;carce any where amount to a Sub&s;i&s;tence; wherefore the &s;ame Act gave Li|berty to the Clergy, to hold two Pari&s;hes, with the Con&s;ent of the re&s;pective Ve&s;tries: the Legi&s;lature then ju&s;tly con&s;i|dering, that one Pari&s;h in tho&s;e Days could not be deemed a Competency. But they did not omit to ob&s;erve as a further Incouragement to the Clergy, that their Income would cer|tainly increa&s;e with Time; and it has proved &s;o; tho' there are many Pari&s;hes that are not yet a Competency: and no &s;ooner does any Pari&s;h &s;well to any con&s;iderable Bulk, but it is immediately di&s;member'd and divided by Act of A&s;&s;embly.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, &s;ince the making the fir&s;t Law, and contrary to the Intent of it, an additional Duty or Deduction of five <HI>per Cent.</HI> out of the forty <HI>per</HI> Poll, charged for Collection, was put upon the whole Clergy by a <HI>&s;ub&s;equent</HI> Act,
tho' that fir&s;t Act had provided and directed <Q>that the Sheriff should collect the 40 <HI>per</HI> Poll in the &s;ame Manner and by the &s;ame Autho|rity, as he did the Publick and County Levies:</Q> which are paid for by the Country, and given to the &s;everal Officers with|out deducting any Thing for Collection.
So far then has the Intere&s;t of the Clergy been from being advanc'd, that by this additional Charge for Collection, it was reduced two <HI>per</HI> Poll; and tho' (as was before &s;aid) many Pari&s;hes previous to the late Act for deducting one fourth, are not a Com|petency; there was not one in the whole Province that ex|ceeded a rea&s;onable Sub&s;i&s;tence.</P>
<P>But further; the Increa&s;e of People in every Pari&s;h increa|&s;es likewi&s;e the Mini&s;ter's Labour and Duty, which (it is
<PB N="5" REF="039950_0005_1016263A6969A770">
humbly conceived) &s;hould in ju&s;tice increa&s;e or add to his Sub|&s;i&s;tence.</P>
<P>From all which, it is hoped, that it is Evident that the In|crea&s;e of People under the afore&s;aid Circum&s;tances, is not a good Rea&s;on, for deducting a fourth Part of the Clergy's Sub|&s;i&s;tence.</P>
<P>To the &s;econd Rea&s;on &s;ugge&s;ted by the Council, in &s;upport of the Act, it is an&s;wered in behalf of the Clergy; That &s;up|po&s;ing this Act had the pretended or de&s;igned Effect, <HI>i. e.</HI> by le&s;&s;ening the Quantity of <HI>Tobacco,</HI> to rai&s;e it in Value, perhaps to twenty Shillings a Hundred; yet the Clergy can be no Gainers, but great Sufferers, &s;ince the People are in that Ca&s;e by the Act left at liberty to pay the Clergy in current Money at ten Shillings a Hundred. On the other hand, if (as mo&s;t People think) the Act will not le&s;&s;en the Quantity, and con&s;e+quently not rai&s;e the Value of <HI>Tobacco,</HI> it cannot be a&s;&s;igned with any colour of Ju&s;tice, as a good Rea&s;on that the Clergy mu&s;t be paid in <HI>Tobacco, three fourths</HI> for the whole. Such a &s;trange and unhappy Dilemma has this Act put the Clergy under!</P>
<P>But &s;till, &s;uppo&s;ing this Act &s;hould le&s;&s;en the Quantity of <HI>To+bacco,</HI> the le&s;s Quantity of that, the People are limited to, th<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="in gutter" EXTENT="1 letter"> more they will make of other Commodities; which will com+pen&s;ate their Deficiencies in <HI>Tobacco.</HI> And it is humbly con+ceived, that the le&s;&s;ening only the Quantity of one Commo+dity, when the People are at liberty of making as much a<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="in gutter" EXTENT="1 letter"> they can of all others, to any Share whereof, the Clergy hav<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="in gutter" EXTENT="1 letter"> no legal Pretence, cannot be a good Rea&s;on for deducting <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="in gutter" EXTENT="1 letter"> fourth Part of the Clergy's Sub&s;i&s;tence.</P>
<P>To the third and la&s;t Rea&s;on &s;ugge&s;ted by the Council o<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="in gutter" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>Maryland,</HI> in Support of this Act, it is an&s;wered on behalf <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="in gutter" EXTENT="1 word"> the Clergy; That their Circum&s;tances, with re&s;pect to world<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="in gutter" EXTENT="2 letters"> Intere&s;t or Gain, is va&s;tly different from that of any other Se<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="in gutter" EXTENT="1 letter"> of Men in that Province; for all other Per&s;ons, of what Im+ployment &s;oever, are at liberty to pur&s;ue Gain, by turnin<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="in gutter" EXTENT="1 letter"> their Effects into &s;ome Sort of Merchandize or Traffick, b<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="in gutter" EXTENT="2 letters"> the Clergy are wholly confined from &s;haring in any Advantage of that Kind; fir&s;t, by their Education and Character, an<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="in gutter" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;econdly, by the Exten&s;ivene&s;s of their Cures, which requi<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="in gutter" EXTENT="2 letters"> continual Application and Indu&s;try.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="039950_0006_1016263D42C63098">It is probable, that the Lawyers and others who are well ac|quainted with the Cour&s;e of Trade and Bu&s;ine&s;s, may gain more than they lo&s;e by the Act; but the poor and unimprovable Allowance that is given for the Maintenance of the Clergy, puts them on no Equality with other People; their whole De|pendance being on the E&s;tabli&s;hed Maintenance, &s;o that what|ever is taken from them, does &s;o far deprive them of the Ne|ce&s;&s;aries of Life.</P>
<P>It is therefore humbly hoped, that when this Act comes to be deliberately con&s;idered by the Lords of his Maje&s;ty's mo&s;t Honourable Privy-Council, in their Committee for Plantation-Affairs, they will for the Rea&s;ons here offered, be plea&s;ed to move his mo&s;t Excellent Maje&s;ty to cau&s;e the &s;aid Act to be repealed, with &s;uch proper and permanent In&s;tructions, to the Governour and Council of the &s;aid Province for the time being, as may re-e&s;tabli&s;h the Clergy in their former Rights &s;o graci|ou&s;ly conferr'd on them by the Crown, and effectually prevent Incroachments of the like, or any other nature, for the Future.</P>
