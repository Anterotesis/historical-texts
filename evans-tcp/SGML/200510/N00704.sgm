2.10. Which was a grief to their Enemies, but matter of great rejoycing to that good People in their afflicted and low condition.</P>
<P>This People of <HI>New England</HI> are a People whom God hath Signally owned &amp; ble&s;&s;ed in our fir&s;t &amp; former times; our Fathers coming into the&s;e ends of the Earth not upon any Worldly de&s;ign, but meerly on the account of Religion; they had much of the gracious Pre&s;ence of God with them in their Planting and Building Work, and in lay|ing the Foundations in Church &amp; Common wealth, and in the additional ble&s;&s;ings of Heaven &amp; Earth, and Sea &amp; Land; So that from a day of &s;mall things, <HI>New England</HI> in a few years was grown up to be a thriving and flouri&s;hing Plantation: But alas, we their Succe&s;&s;ors have not an&s;wered the Lords Expectation, or our own Profe&s;&s;ion, but as we have been multiplyed &amp; encrea&s;ed, &s;o we have Sin|ned, and provoked the Lord to anger again&s;t us, &s;o that of late years He hath Severely witne&s;&s;ed again&s;t us by the variety of His Judgments in a Succe&s;&s;ive way, and for a long time; So that we are at pre&s;ent an Afflicted &amp; poor People, greatly dimini&s;hed, impoveri&s;hed and brought very low, <HI>through Oppre&s;&s;ion, Affliction and Sorrow</HI>: as it is in <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 107. from <HI>v.</HI> 33 to 42.

And with re&s;pect unto the latter dayes it is

<P>This Elaborate and Pious Di&s;cour&s;e of my Re|verend Brother &amp; Colleague in the Work of the Mini&s;try here at <HI>Salem,</HI> was Preached at <HI>Boston</HI> on the Anniver&s;ary day of Election, according to our Cu&s;tom from the beginning: He was called to this Service by the Honorable the Lieutenant Go|vernour and Council; and the Publi&s;hing of it was De&s;ired &amp; Ordered by the General Court. There is &s;omething in the Text Prophetical &amp; &s;omething
<PB REF="000850_0008_0FABA2B284C60BC0" MS="y">
Didactical. It is agreed upon by all Sober Divines and Chri&s;tians, that we are not to expect a full un|der&s;tanding of the Prophecies until they be fulfilled, and that there may be a gradual and partial fulfill|ing of &s;undry Prophecies at &s;everal times; and yet &s;ome &s;pecial Time be intended for the eminent &amp; full accompli&s;hment of them: Al&s;o, that not the Prophecies but the Precepts of Scripture are to be the Rule of our Actions. It belongs to God to fulfill with His Hand what He hath &s;poken with His Mouth, and that in the times and by the ways &amp; means which are known unto Him, but unknown to us; it belongs to us to ob&s;erve His Commandments concerning our pre&s;ent duties, whatever the ca&s;e be, leaving all future Events to God. <HI>Deut.</HI> 29 29 Yet are Prophe&s;ies a ground of our Faith, Hope and Prayer, relating to their Ac|compli&s;hment: and &s;o far Prophe&s;ies are doctrinal, <HI>Dan.</HI> 9.2, 3. And it is the doctrinal part of the Scriptures that mainly concerns us to direct us in all ca&s;es in the way of our duty to God &amp; men, as the Reverend Author according to the Wi&s;dom and Grace given unto him, hath declared unto us with much Evidence from Scripture light. Hence it is without que&s;tion the duty of the Church and People of God <HI>to be an Habitation of Ju&s;tice and Mountain of Holine&s;s,</HI> at all times &amp; in all places of the World: and becau&s;e God hath foretold and p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">omi&s;ed that it &s;hall be Eminently &amp; Con&s;picu|ou&s;ly &s;o at &s;ome times and in &s;ome places in the&s;e
<PB REF="000850_0009_0FABA2B2E2A18A20" MS="y">
la&s;t dayes that are come and coming upon the World, therefore we are to aime at it and endea|vour after it, in all the wayes of our duty, that it may be &s;o with us in that mea&s;ure as the Lord &s;hall plea&s;e to grant the &s;ame unto us; for it is certain, &s;o far as we attain thereunto we &s;hall be a People ble&s;&s;ed of the Lord: For the&s;e two, <HI>Holine&s;s towards God, and Righteou&s;ne&s;s towards men,</HI> are like unto the two Pillars in the Temple of God <HI>Jachin</HI> and <HI>Boaz,</HI> which did &s;ignify the Strength and E|&s;tabli&s;hment of the welfare of the Church &amp; Peo|ple of God, while they continue in the Righteous and Holy wayes of the ble&s;&s;ed God.</P>
<P>This duty of endeavouring that <HI>New-England</HI> may be <HI>an Habitation of Ju&s;tice and Mountain of Ho|line&s;s,</HI> though it is incumbent upon all, yet it is in a &s;pecial manner committed to and betru&s;ted with Your EXCELLENCY according to that High Station which GOD and the KING have &s;et You in: and then it is required of all orders and ranks of men; both Magi&s;trates, Mini&s;ters and People (every one in their own place) that they move regularly in concurrence with Your Lord|&s;hip in all things that may conduce unto that end: Though it may be SIR, You may &s;ometimes meet with difficulties in Your way, and find things ami&s;s that cannot pre&s;ently be amended. So did <HI>Solomon,</HI> who though he was the wi&s;e&s;t of Kings with a mo&s;t prudent Council, and a morigerous

People; yet out of his Experience he informs us, <HI>that which was wanting could not be numbred, or that which was crooked could not be made &s;treight</HI>: and therefore he gives this advice to others, <HI>Con&s;ider the work of God, for who can make that &s;treight which He hath made crooked.</HI> Eccl. 7.13. And therefore it will be no wonder if You &s;hould find it &s;o. Yet let me tell You from the Word of the Lord, that the &s;ame Encouragement which the Lord gave unto <HI>Jo&s;hua,</HI> for the Sub&s;tance and Scope of it, be|longs unto any of His Servants whom He &s;ets in the place of Government over His People, <HI>viz Be thou Strong and of good Courage in ob&s;erving all the Commandments of God &s;o &s;halt thou make thy way pro&s;|perous and thou &s;halt have good Succe&s;s, for I will not leave thee, nor for&s;ake thee, &s;aith the Lord.</HI> Jo&s;h. 1. from <HI>v</HI> 5. to <HI>v.</HI> 10. compared with <HI>Heb.</HI> 13.5.

I hope in God it will al&s;o be &s;aid by all this Peo|ple (as it was then expre&s;&s;ed by &s;ome in the Name of the re&s;t) <HI>We al&s;o will be with thee, viz.</HI> That You will have the Hearts and Prayers and endea|vours, of all the good People of the Land with You in what&s;oever may have a tendency to the making of this our <HI>New-England, to be an Habitation of Ju&s;tice and Mountain of Holine&s;s</HI>; the Lord grant that it may be &s;o.</P>

<P>In the third Doctrine there are three particulars contained: the two fir&s;t more implicitely, the third mo&s;t expre&s;sly.</P>
<P N="1">1.

<P N="2">2. Places that are become degenerate, how&s;o|ever happy they were before, may become very mi&s;erable, very de&s;olate.

<P N="3">3. Notwith&s;tanding &s;uch degeneration and de|&s;olation too, there is ground of hope, that God will again re&s;tore, reform and ble&s;s &s;uch a People. I &s;hall prove this po&s;ition by producing the grounds of Hope the Scriptures offer in this ca&s;e.</P>
<P N="1">1. God <HI>Can</HI> do it if he <HI>Will.</HI> That is not altoge|ther <HI>incredible</HI> which is not <HI>impo&s;&s;ible.</HI> What can not <HI>Omnipotency</HI> do?

If <HI>Abraham</HI> had Staggered at the promi&s;e through unbelief of <HI>Gods Power,</HI> he had not been father of many Nation. But again&s;t hope he believed in hope, knowing that <HI>God quickned the dead and called things that are not, as if they were. He was &s;trong in faith, giving glory to God, being fully per|&s;waded that what he had promi&s;ed he was able to per|form.</HI> Rom. 4 17, 18, 20, 21.

continue as a Rule of life. And the Lord Je&s;us is &s;o far from aboli&s;hing it, that <HI>he puts it into the in|ward parts of believers, and writes it in their hearts.</HI> Jer. 31.33. It was the error of the Jews in the A|po&s;tles time, to think the law was given as a Co|venant of Works; by the keeping of which they might be ju&s;tifyed, and have eternal life. Again&s;t this the Apo&s;tle argues, that the inheritance, was by <HI>Promi&s;e,</HI> and that God gave it to <HI>Abraham by promi&s;e,</HI> and the law which was given at Sinai 430 years after, could not di&s;anul it; and makes it an ab&s;urd thing for any to think that righteou&s;ne&s;s comes by the law, and if &s;o &s;aith he, <HI>then Chri&s;t is dead in vain.</HI> Gal. 2.21.
