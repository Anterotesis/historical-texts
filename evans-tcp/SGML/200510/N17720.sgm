<P>THE Subscribers (to whom the Editor thank|fully professes his obligations) may reasonably expect an apology for the delay, which has at|tended the appearance of THE CONTRAST; but, as the true cause cannot be declared with|out leading to a discussion, which the Editor wishes to avoid, he hopes, that the care and ex|pence, which have been bestowed upon this work, will be accepted, without further scrutiny, as an atonement for his seeming negligence.</P>
<P>In justice to the Author, however, it may be proper to observe, that this Comedy has many claims to the public indulgence, independent of its intrinsic merits: It is the first essay of American genius in a difficult species of com|position; it was written by one, who never cri|tically
<PB N="viii" REF="022948_0006_0FBAC52B647B0CE0">
studied the rules of the drama, and, in|deed, had seen but few of the exhibitions of the stage; it was undertaken and finished in the course of three weeks; and the profits of one night's performance were appropriated to the benefit of the sufferers by the fire at <HI>Boston.</HI></P>
<P>These considerations will therefore it is hoped, supply in the closet the advantages, that are de|rived from representation, and dispose the read|er to join in the applause, which has been be|stowed on this Comedy by numerous and judi|cious audiences in the Theatres of <HI>Philadelphia, New-York,</HI> and <HI>Maryland.</HI></P>

<SPEAKER>CHARLOTTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, I don't say so: It may be very becoming to saunter round the house of a rainy day; to visit my grand-mamma, or to go to Quakers' meeting; but to swim in a minuet, with the eyes of fifty well|dressed beaux upon me, to trip it in the Mall, or walk on the battery, give me the luxurious, jaunty, flowing, bell-hoop. It would have delighted you to have seen me the last evening, my charming girl! I was dangling o'er the battery with Billy Dimple; a knot of young fellows were upon the platform; as I passed them I faultered with one of the most bewitching false steps you ever saw, and then re|covered myself with such a pretty confusion, flirting my hoop to discover a jet black shoe and brilliant buckle. Gad! how my little heart thrilled to hear the confused raptures of &mdash;  "<HI>Demme, Jack, what a delicate foot!</HI>" "<HI> Ha! General, what a well|turn'd &mdash; </HI>"</P>

<P>Fie! fie! Charlotte, <STAGE>[stopping her mouth]</STAGE> I pro|test you are quite a libertine.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOTTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, my dear little prude, are we not all such libertines? Do you think, when I sat tortured two hours under the hands of my friseur, and an hour more at my toilet, that I had any thoughts of my aunt Susan, or my cousin Betsey? though they are both allowed to be critical judges of dress.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LETITIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, who should we dress to please, but those who are judges of its merit?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOTTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why a creature who does not know <HI>Buffon</HI> from <HI>Soufle&egrave;</HI> &mdash; Man! &mdash; my Letitia &mdash; Man! for whom we dress, walk, dance, talk, lisp, languish, and smile. Does not the grave Spectator assure us, that even our much bepraised diffidence, modesty, and blush|es, are all directed to make ourselves&punc; good wives and mothers as fast as we can. Why I'll undertake with one flirt of this hoop to bring more beaux to my feet in one week, than the grave Maria, and her sentimental circle, can do, by sighing sentiment till their hairs are grey.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LETITIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, I won't argue with you; you always out talk me; let us change the subject. I hear that Mr. Dimple and Maria are soon to be married.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOTTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>You hear true. I was consulted in the choice of the wedding clothes. She is to be married in a delicate white sattin, and has a monstrous pretty brocaded lutestring for the second day. It would have done you good to have seen with what an af|fected indifference the dear sentimentalist <HI REND="margQuotes">turned over a thousand pretty things, just as if her heart did not palpitate with her approaching happiness,
<PB N="3" REF="022948_0023_0FBAC2F7302929A0">
and at last made her choice, and</HI> arranged her dress with such apathy, as if she did not know that plain white sattin, and a simple blond lace, would shew her clear skin, and dark hair, to the greatest advantage.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LETITIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>But they say her indifference to dress, and even to the gentleman himself, is not entirely affected.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOTTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>How?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LETITIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is whispered, that if Maria gives her hand to Mr. Dimple, it will be without her heart.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOTTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Though the giving the heart is one of the last of all laughable considerations in the marriage of a girl of spirit, yet I should like to hear what anti|quated notions the dear little piece of old fashioned prudery has got in her head.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LETITIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why you know that old Mr. John-Richard-Ro|bert-Jacob-Isaac-Abraham-Cornelius Van Dump|ling, Billy Dimple's father, (for he has thought fit to soften his name, as well as manners, during his English tour) was the most intimate friend of Ma|ria's father. The old folks, about a year before Mr. Van Dumpling's death, proposed this match: the young folks were accordingly introduced, and told they must love one another. Billy was then a good natured, decent, dressing young fellow, with a little dash of the coxcomb, such as our young fel|lows of fortune usually have. At this time, I really believe she thought she loved him; and had they then been married, I doubt not, they might have jogged on, to the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">nd of the chapter, a good kind of a sing-song lack-a-daysaical life, as other honest married folks do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOTTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why did they not then marry?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="4" REF="022948_0024_0FBAC2F8E81B5968">
<SPEAKER>LETITIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Upon the death of his father, Billy went to Eng|land to see the world, and rub off a little of the pa|troon rust. During his absence, Maria like a good girl, to keep herself constant to her <HI>nown true-love,</HI> avoided company, and betook herself, for her amuse|ment, to her books, and her dear Billy's letters. But, alas! how many ways has the mischievous de|mon of inconstancy of stealing into a woman's heart! Her love was destroyed by the very means she took to support it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOTTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>How? &mdash; Oh! I have it &mdash; some likely young beau found the way to her study.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LETITIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Be patient, Charlotte &mdash; your head so runs upon beaux. &mdash; Why she read Sir Charles Grandison, Cla|rissa Harlow, Shenstone, and the Sentimental Jour|ney; and between whiles, as I said, Billy's letters. But as her taste improved, her love declined. The contrast was so striking betwixt the good sense of her books, and the flimsiness of her love-letters, that she discovered she had unthinkingly engaged her hand without her heart; and then the whole transaction managed by the old folks, now appear|ed so unsentimental, and looked so like bargain|ing for a bale of goods, that she found she ought to have rejected, according to every rule of ro|mance, even the man of her choice, if imposed up|on her in that manner &mdash; Clary Harlow would have scorned such a match.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOTTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, how was it on Mr. Dimple's return? Did he meet a more favourable reception than his let|ters?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LETITIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Much the same. She spoke of him with respect abroad, and with contempt in her closet. She
<PB N="5" REF="022948_0025_0FBAC2FBEEF9FC58">
watched his conduct and conversation, and found that he had by travelling acquired the wickedness of Lovelace without his wit, and the politeness of Sir Charles Grandison without his generosity. The ruddy youth who washed his face at the cistern every morning, and swore and looked eternal love and constancy, was now metamorphosed into a flip|pant, palid, polite beau, who devotes the morning to his toilet, reads a few pages of Chesterfield's let|ters, and then minces out, to put the infamous principles in practice upon every woman he meets.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOTTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, if she is so apt at conjuring up these senti|mental bugbears, why does she not discard him at once?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LETITIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, she thinks her word too sacred to be trifled with. Besides, her father, who has a great respect for the memory of his deceased friend, is ever telling her how he shall renew his years in their union, and repeating the dying injunctions of old Van Dumpling.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOTTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>A mighty pretty story! And so you would make me believe, that the sensible Maria would give up Dumpling manor, and the all-accomplished Dim|ple as a husband, for the absurd, ridiculous reason, sorsooth, because she despises and abhors him. Just as if a lady could not be privileged to spend a man's fortune, ride in his carriage, be called after his name, and call him her <HI>nown dear lovee</HI> when she wants money, without loving and respecting the great he-creature. Oh! my dear girl, you are a monstrous prude.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LETITIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't say what I would do; I only intimate how I suppose she wishes to act.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOTTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, no! A fig for sentiment. If she breaks,
<PB N="6" REF="022948_0026_0FBAC2FD30F28C50">
or wishes to break, with Mr. Dimple, depend upon it, she has some other man in her eye. A woman rarely discards one lover, until she is sure of an|other. &mdash; Letitia little thinks what a clue I have to Dimple's conduct. The generous man submits to render himself disgusting to Maria, in order that she may leave him at liberty to address me. I must change the subject.</P>

<P>Sally Bloomsbury married! &mdash; Why she is not yet in her teens.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOTTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not know how that is, but, you may depend upon it, 'tis a done affair. I have it from the best authority. There is my aunt Wyerley's Hannah, (you know Hannah &mdash; though a black, she is a wench that was never caught in a lie in her life;) now Hannah has a brother who courts Sarah, Mrs. Cat|gut the milliner's girl, and she told Hannah's bro|ther, and Hannah, who, as I said before, is a girl of undoubted veracity, told it directly to me, that Mrs. Catgut was making a new cap for Miss Blooms|bury, which, as it was very dressy, it is very pro|bable is designed for a wedding cap: now, as she is to be married, who can it be to, but to Mr. In|digo? Why there is no other gentleman that visits at her papa's.</P>

<SPEAKER>LETITIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Say not a word more Charlotte. Your intelli|gence is so direct and well grounded, it is almost a pity that it is not a piece of scandal.</P>

It is true, there is infinite pleasure in this charitable pursuit. Oh! how delicious to go and condole with the friends of some backsliding sister, or to retire with some old dowager or maiden aunt of the family, who love scandal so well, that they cannot forbear gratifying their appetite at the expence of the reputation of their nearest relations! And then to return full fraught with a rich collection of circumstances, to retail to the next circle of our acquaintance under the strongest injunctions of secrecy, &mdash; ha, ha, ha! &mdash; interlarding the melancholy tale with so many dole|ful shakes of the head, and more doleful <HI REND="margQuotes">Ah! who would have thought it! so amiable, so prudent a young lady, as we all thought her, what a mon|strous pity! well, I have nothing to charge my|self with; I acted the part of a friend, I warned her of the principles of that rake, I told her what would be the consequence; I told her so. I told her so.</HI> &mdash; Ha, ha, ha!</P>

I may be romantic, but I preserve them as a sacred deposit. Their full amount is justly due to me, but as embarrassments, the natural consequences of a long war, disable my country from supporting its credit, I shall wait with patience until it is rich enough to discharge them. If that is not in my day, they shall be transmitted as an honourable certificate to posterity, that I have humbly imitated our illustrious WASHING|TON, in having exposed my health and life in the service of my country, without reaping any other reward than the glory of conquering in so arduous a contest.</P>

Oh! the sentimental charms of a side-box conversation! <STAGE>[All laugh.]</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MANLY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, sister, I join heartily with you in the laugh; for, in my opinion, it is as justifiable to laugh at folly, as it is reprehensible to ridicule misfortune.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOTTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but brother, positively I can't introduce you in these clothes: why, your coat looks as if it were calculated for the vulgar purpose of keeping yourself comfortable.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MANLY.</SPEAKER>
<P>This coat was my regimental coat in the late war. The public tumults of our state, have induced me to buckle on the sword in support of that govern|ment which I once fought to establish. I can on|ly say, sister, that there was a time when this coat was respectable, and some people even thought, that those men who had endured so many winter campaigns in the service of their country, without bread, clothing or pay, at least deserved that the poverty of their appearance should not be ridiculed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOTTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>We agree in opinion entirely, brother, though it would not have done for me to have said it: it is the coat makes the man respectable. In the time of the war, when we were almost frightened to death,
<PB N="24" REF="022948_0044_0FBAC321316B2B38">
why, your coat was respectable, that is, fashionable; now another kind of coat is fashionable, that is, respectable. And pray direct the taylor to make yours the height of the fashion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MANLY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Though it is of little consequence to me of what shape my coat is, yet, as to the height of the fashion, there you will please to excuse me, sister. You know my sentiments on that subject. I have often lamented the advantage which the French have over us in that particular. In Paris, the fashions have their dawnings, their routine and declensions, and depend as much upon the caprice of the day as in other countries; but there every lady assumes a right to deviate from the general <HI>ton,</HI> as far as will be of advantage to her own appearance. In America, the cry is, what is the fashion? and we follow it, indiscriminately, because it is so.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOTTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Therefore it is, that when large hoops are in fashion, we often see many a plump girl lost in the immensity of a hoop-petticoat, whose want of height and <HI>en-bon-point</HI> would never have been remarked in any other dress. When the high head-dress is the mode, how then do we see a lofty cushion, with a profusion of gauze, feathers, and ribband, sup|ported by a face no bigger than an apple; whilst a broad full-faced lady, who really would have ap|peared tolerably handsome in a large head-dress, looks with her smart chapeau as masculine as a soldier.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MANLY.</SPEAKER>
<P>But remember, my dear sister, and I wish all my fair country-women would recollect, that the only excuse a young lady can have for going extrava|gantly into a fashion, is, because it makes her look extravagantly handsome. &mdash; Ladies I must wish you a good morning.</P>

<P>Oh! I have seen a power of fine sights. I went to see two marble-stone men and a leaden horse, that stands out in doors in all weathers; and when I came where they was, one had got no head, and t'other wer'nt there. They said as how the leaden man was a damn'd tory, and that he took wit in his anger and rode off in the time of the troubles.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>JESSAMY.</SPEAKER>
<P>But this was not the end of your excursion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JONATHAN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh no; I went to a place they call Holy Ground. Now I counted this was a place where folks go to meeting; so I put my <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> book in my pocket, and walked softly and grave as a minister; and when I came there, the dogs a bit of a meeting|house could I see. At last I spied a young gentle|woman standing by one of the seats, which they have here at the doors &mdash; I took her to be the dea|con's daughter, and she looked so kind, and so obliging, that I thought I would go and ask her the way to lecture, and would you think it &mdash; she called me dear, and sweeting, and honey, just as if we were married: by the living jingo, I had a month's mind to buss her.</P>

beauty. When the lady thought it necessary to check his ardour, she called up a frown upon her lovely face, so irresistably alluring, that it would have warmed the frozen bosom of age: remember, said she, putting her delicate arm upon his, re|member your character and my honour. My mas|ter instantly dropped upon his knees, with eyes swimming with love, cheeks glowing with desire, and in the gentlest modulation of voice, he said &mdash; My dear Caroline, in a few months our hands will be indissolubly united at the altar; our hearts I feel are already so &mdash; the favours you now grant as evidence of your affection, are favours indeed; yet when the ceremony is once past, what will now be received with rapture, will then be attributed to duty.</P>

upon her person." Extremely just, my lord; every day's delightful experience confirms this. "If her face is so shocking, that she must, in some degree, be conscious of it, her figure and air, she thinks, make ample amends for it." The sallow Miss Wan is a proof of this. &mdash; Upon my telling the distasteful wretch, the other day, that her counte|nance spoke the pensive language of sentiment, and that Lady Wortley Montague declared, that if the ladies were arrayed in the garb of innocence, the face would be the last part which would be admired, as Monsieur Milton expresses it, she grin'd horribly a ghastly smile.

Chesterfield himself, who made, however, the worst practice of the most excellent precepts, was never in so em|barrassing a situation.

Oh! no, no, no! you won't catch me at a play-house, I warrant you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JENNY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Mr. Jonathan, though I don't scruple your veracity, I have some reasons for believing you were there: pray, where were you about six o'clock?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JONATHAN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, I went to see one Mr. Morrison, the <HI>hocus pocus</HI> man; they said as how he could eat a case knife.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JENNY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, and how did you find the place?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JONATHAN.</SPEAKER>
<P>As I was going about here and there, to and again, to find it, I saw a great croud of folks go|ing into a long entry, that had lantherns over the door; so I asked a man, whether that was not the place where they played <HI>hocus pocus?</HI> He was a very civil kind man, though he did speak like the Hessians; he lifted up his eyes and said &mdash; "they play <HI>hocus pocus</HI> tricks enough there, Got knows, mine friend."</P>

<SPEAKER>JENNY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well &mdash; </P>
</SP>

<P>So I went right in, and they shewed me away clean up to the garret, just like meeting-house gal|lery. And so I saw a power of topping folks, all sitting round in little cabbins, <HI REND="margQuotes">just like father's corn-cribs;</HI> &mdash; and then there was such a squeak|ing with the fiddles, and such a tarnal blaze with

the lights, my head was near turned. At last the people that sat near me set up such a hissing &mdash; hiss &mdash; like so many mad cats; and then they went thump, thump, thump, just like our Peleg threshing wheat, and stampt away, just like the nation; and called out for one Mr. Langolee, &mdash; I suppose he helps acts the tricks.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>JENNY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, and what did you do all this time?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JONATHAN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Gor, I &mdash; I liked the fun, and so I thumpt away, and hiss'd as lustily as the best of 'em. One <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">or|looking man that sat by me, seeing me stamp, and knowing I was a cute fellow, because I could make a roaring noise, clapt me on the shoulder and said, you are a d &mdash; d hearty cock, smite my timbers!

<P>Yes. There was one youngster, they called him Mr. Joseph; he talked as sober and as pious as a minister; but like some ministers that I know, he was a fly tike in his heart for all that: He was go|ing to ask a young woman to spark it with him, and &mdash; the Lord have mercy on my soul! &mdash; she was another man's wife.</P>

<P>It must be so, Montague! and it is not all the tribe of Mandevilles shall convince me, that a na|tion, to become great, must first become dissipated. Luxury is surely the bane of a nation: Luxury! which enervates both soul and body, by opening a thousand new sources of enjoyment, opens, also, a thousand new sources of contention and want: Lux|ury! which renders a people weak at home, and accessible to bribery, corruption, and force from abroad. When the Grecian states knew no other tools than the axe and the saw, the Grecians were a great, a free, and a happy people. The kings of Greece devoted their lives to the service of their country, and her senators knew no other superiori|ty over their fellow-citizens, than a glorious pre|eminence in danger and virtue. They exhibited to the world a noble spectacle, &mdash; a number of inde|pendent states united by a similarity of language, sentiment, manners, common interest, and com|mon consent, in one grand mutual league of pro|tection. &mdash; And, thus united, long might they have continued the cherishers of arts and sciences, the protectors of the oppressed, the scourge of tyrants, and the safe asylum of liberty: But when foreign gold, and still more pernicious, foreign luxury, had crept among them, they sapped the vitals of their virtue. The virtues of their ancestors were only found in their writings. Envy and suspicion, the vices of little minds, possessed them. The va|rious states engendered jealousies of each other; and, more unfortunately, growing jealous of their great federal council, the Amphictyons, they for|got that their common safety had existed, and would
<PB N="49" REF="022948_0069_0FBAC3542DD58D10">
exist, in giving them an honourable extensive pre|rogative. The common good was lost in the pur|suit of private interest; and that people, who, by uniting, might have stood against the world in arms, by dividing, crumbled into ruin; &mdash; their name is now only known in the page of the historian, and what they once were, is all we have left to admire.

to us those inestimable blessings that we how enjoy, our liberty and independence, they demand every attention which gratitude can pay.

when a man of the world and a finished co|quet meet, who perfectly know each other: but how delicious is it to excite the emotions of joy, hope, expectation, and delight, in the bosom of a lovely girl, who believes every tittle of what you say to be serious.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MANLY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Serious, Sir! In my opinion, the man, who, un|der pretensions of marriage, can plant thorns in the bosom of an innocent, unsuspecting girl, is more detestable than a common robber, in the same pro|portion, as private violence is more despicable than open force, and money of less value than happiness.</P>

<P>Cautious, Sir! <HI REND="margQuotes">No person more approves of an intercourse between the sexes than I do. Female conversation softens our manners, whilst our dis|course, from the superiority of our literary ad|vantages, improves their minds. But, in our young country, where there is no such thing as gallantry, when a gentleman speaks of love to a lady, whether he mentions marriage, or not, she ought to conclude, either that he meant to insult her, or, that his intentions are the most serious and honourable.</HI> How mean, how cruel, is it, by a thousand tender assiduities, to win the affecti|ons of an amiable girl, and, though you leave her virtue unspotted, to betray her into the appearance of so many tender partialities, that every man of delicacy would suppress his inclination towards her, by supposing her heart engaged! Can any man, for the trivial gratification of his leisure-hours, affect the happiness of a whole life! His not having spoken of marriage, may add to his perfidy, but can be no excuse for his conduct.</P>

<P>Yes; &mdash; one of the strangest accidents in the world.

<P>I have, a little: and by it have discovered, that there is a laudable partiality, which ignorant, un|travelled men entertain for every thing that belongs to their native country. I call it laudable; &mdash; it in|jures no one; adds to their own happiness; and, when extended, becomes the noble principle of patriotism. Travelled gentlemen rise superior, in their own opinion, to this: but, if the contempt, which they contract for their country, is the most valuable acquisition of their travels, I am far from thinking that their time and money are well spent.</P>

No, no; Mary is right.

<P>That's the very fault, Mr. Jonathan. Besides, you absolutely misplace it. I was told by a friend of mine, that you laughed outright at the play the other night, when you ought only to have tittered.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>JESSAMY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why you know, Mr. Jonathan, that to dance, a lady to play with her fan, or a gentleman with his cane, and all other natural motions, are regulated by art. My master has composed an immensely pretty gamut, by which any lady, or gentleman, with a few years close application, may learn to laugh as gracefully, as if they were born and bred to it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JONATHAN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mercy on my soul! A gamut for laughing &mdash; just like fa, la, sol?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JESSAMY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes. It comprises every possible display of jo|cularity, from an <HI>offettuoso</HI> smile to a <HI>piano</HI> titter, or full chorus <HI>fortissimo</HI> ha, ha, ha! My master em|ploys his leisure-hours in marking out the plays, like a cathedral chanting-book, that the ignorant may know where to laugh; and that pit, box, and gallery, may keep time together, and not have a snigger in one part of the house, a broad grin in
<PB N="68" REF="022948_0088_0FBAC37B622D34E0">
the other, and a d &mdash; d grum look in the third. How delightful to see the audience all smile toge|ther, then look on their books, then twist their mouths into an agreeable simper, then altogether shake the house with a general ha, ha, ha! loud as a full chorus of Handel's, at an Abbey-commemo|ration.</P>

<P>Ha, ha, ha! that's dang'd cute, I swear.</P>

<P>Well, can't you let me see that gamut?</P>

<P>Oh! yes, Mr. Jonathan; here it is. <STAGE>[Takes out a book.]</STAGE> Oh! no, this is only a titter with its varia|tions. Ah, here it is. <STAGE>[Takes out another.]</STAGE> Now you must know, Mr. Jonathan, this is a piece written by Ben Johnson, which I have set to my master's gamut. The places where you must smile, look grave, or laugh outright&punc; are marked below the line. Now look over me. &mdash; "There was a cer|tain man" &mdash; now you must smile.</P>

Aye! there's the sting; for, were I assured that Maria was happy, my heart is not so selfish, but that it would dilate in knowing it, even though it were with another. &mdash; But to know she is unhappy! &mdash; I must drive these thoughts from me.

<P>I can explain it to that gentleman's confusion. Though long betrothed to your daughter, <STAGE>[to Van Rough]</STAGE> yet allured by my fortune, it seems, (with shame do I speak it) he has privately paid his addresses to me. I was drawn-in to listen to him by his assuring me, that the match was made by his father without his consent, and that he pro|posed to break with Maria, whether he married me or not.
