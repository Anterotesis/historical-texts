<P>What the <HI>Angel</HI> &s;aid unto the <HI>Shepherds</HI> of <HI>Bethlehem,</HI> is now proper to be &s;poken unto the <HI>Sinners,</HI> [And, <HI>Ah Lord, Such, even Such we are, every one of us!</HI>] which are here met before the Lord: <HI>Behold, I bring you Good Tidings of Great Joy!</HI> Tho&s;e <HI>Good Tidings</HI> we have thus Expre&s;&s;ed unto us, in P&s;al. 130.4. <HI>There is Forgivene&s;s with thee, that thou may&s;t be Feared,</HI> O Lord.</P>
<P>The <HI>Oracles</HI> of God a&s;&s;ert this Truth a Thou&s;and times over unto us; And, He has Appointed <HI>Sacraments</HI> to a&s;&s;ure us of it.

Iniquity, and Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, and Sin.</HI></P>

<P N="1"><HI>I.</HI> In the <HI>Forgivene&s;s of Sin,</HI> the Sinner is not only <HI>Ab&s;olved,</HI> from his cur&s;ed <HI>Guiltine&s;s,</HI> but al&s;o po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a perfect <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> thro' the <HI>Imputation</HI> of that <HI>Obedience,</HI> which our Lord JESUS CHRIST, as our <HI>Surety,</HI> hath yielded un|to God, for his <HI>Cho&s;en</HI></P>
<P>Let, fir&s;t, a few <HI>preparatory A&s;&s;ertions,</HI> make our Thoughts ready to take in a Right Notion of this Illu&s;trious Benefit&punc; <HI>The Forgivene&s;s of our Sins.</HI></P>
<P>It is to be A&s;&s;erted, That we are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>Sinners</HI> again&s;t the <HI>Law</HI> of God, &amp; have brought horrible Ruines on our &s;elves by our <HI>Sins.</HI> We have this A&s;&s;ertion, in <HI>Ro.</HI> 3.23. <HI>All have &s;inned, and come &s;hort of the Glory of God.</HI> We have by our <HI>Sins,</HI> For|feited all the <HI>Ble&s;&s;ings,</HI> which the <HI>Law</HI> of God promi&s;ed unto the Keepers of that <HI>Law</HI>; yea, we have by our <HI>Sins</HI> Incur|red all tho&s;e <HI>Wants</HI> and <HI>Woes,</HI> &amp; <HI>Plagues,</HI>
<PB REF="000829_0010_0FAB4057E7E0C168">
which the Law has denounced unto them that keep it not.</P>
<P>Again; It is to be A&s;&s;erted, That the <HI>Cho&s;en</HI> of God, cannot be <HI>Re&s;cued,</HI> as He has <HI>purpo&s;ed,</HI> out of their Horrible Ru|ines, except the <HI>Law</HI> of God be An&s;wer|ed. We have this A&s;&s;ertion, in Heb. 1.13. <HI>Thou canst not Look upon Iniquity.</HI> God by His mo&s;t wi&s;e <HI>Law,</HI> hath &s;ecured the Intere&s;ts of His Glory; and He is a <HI>Judge,</HI> that will by no means have the <HI>Equity,</HI> and the <HI>Verity,</HI> of His <HI>Law,</HI> Impeached.</P>
<P>Furthermore; It is to be A&s;&s;erted, That our Lord <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> hath under|taken to <HI>An&s;wer</HI> the <HI>Law</HI> of God, as a <HI>Surety,</HI> on the Behalf of His <HI>Cho&s;en.</HI> We have this A&s;&s;ertion, in Heb. 7.22. <HI>Je&s;us was made a Surety.</HI> The <HI>Son</HI> of God, a&s;&s;uming our <HI>Nature,</HI> became a <HI>Mediator</HI>; and by becoming a <HI>man,</HI> He became ca|pable of being Re&s;pon&s;ible to the <HI>Law</HI> of God, for us; for which cau&s;e, He actually put Him&s;elf, into the Capacity of our <HI>Surety,</HI> that by an&s;wering the Ex|actions of the <HI>Law,</HI> in our <HI>Stead,</HI> He might Accompli&s;h the <HI>Atonement</HI> with God, for which He was, as our <HI>High
<PB N="11" REF="000829_0011_0FAB40599A5A3740">
Prie&s;t</HI> concerned: So that He &s;aid, unto His <HI>Father</HI> concerning <HI>Us,</HI> as <HI>Paul,</HI> (no doubt with &s;ome &s;en&s;e of <HI>That</HI>!) &s;aid unto <HI>Philemon,</HI> about his Run away Ser|vant, <HI>If he has wrong'd thee, or owes the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> a|ny thing, put that on my Account</HI>!</P>
<P>Moreover; It is to be A&s;&s;erted, That it was with a <HI>mutual Agreement,</HI> between <HI>God the Father,</HI> and our <HI>Lord Me&s;&s;iah,</HI> that our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t became a <HI>Surety,</HI> to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n&s;wer the <HI>Law,</HI> for His Cho&s;en. We have this A&s;&s;ertion, in P&s;al. 89.3, 30, 32. <HI>I have made a Covenant with my Cho&s;en,&mdash; If His Children for&s;ake my Law,&mdash;Then will I vi&s;it their Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion with the Rod.</HI> God has indeed bound him&s;elf by His <HI>Law,</HI> That He will be Acknowledged, either in the <HI>Obedience,</HI> or in the <HI>De&s;truction,</HI> of His Creatures. But God has not, by His <HI>Law,</HI> &s;o bound Him&s;elf, that He may not Admit of a <HI>Surety,</HI> who&s;e <HI>Obedience</HI> may go for <HI>ours.</HI> Tho' the Old <HI>Covenant of Works</HI> do not mention a <HI>Surety,</HI> yet a <HI>Surety</HI> was mentioned, and engaged and ordered, in the Ancient <HI>Covenant of Re|demption,</HI> whereto <HI>That</HI> was but Sub&s;ervi|ent, and wherein <HI>God</HI> is become, <HI>The God of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="000829_0012_0FAB4059E84F1F50">Finally; It is to be A&s;&s;erted, That our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, ha's according to <HI>Agree|ment,</HI> an&s;wered the <HI>Law</HI> of God, as our <HI>Surety</HI>; both by Enduring the <HI>Penalty</HI> of the <HI>Law,</HI> whereto we had by our <HI>Sins</HI> Ex|po&s;ed our &s;elves, and by Fulfilling the <HI>Precept</HI> of it, in doing the whole will of God. We have this A&s;&s;ertion, in 1 Joh. 5.6. <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t came, not by Water only, but by Water and Blood.</HI> He came, not on|ly with a <HI>Purity,</HI> and <HI>Sanctity,</HI> conformed, unto the <HI>Law</HI> of God, in all things, but al&s;o with <HI>Expiatory Sufferings,</HI> to make A|mends for our Breaches of the <HI>Law.</HI></P>
<P>Being furni&s;hed with the&s;e <HI>Preparatory A&s;&s;ertions,</HI> Let us now &s;ee, what is done for us in the <HI>Forgivene&s;s of our Sins.</HI></P>
<P>Fir&s;t; In the <HI>Forgivene&s;s of our Sins,</HI> the God of Heaven, does Relea&s;e us, from the <HI>Guiltine&s;s,</HI> wherein we are bound over, to undergo&punc; His Infinite Wrath. The <HI>Law</HI> of God, by a <HI>Just Sentence,</HI> has condem|ned us to Endure Endle&s;s and Ea&s;ele&s;s <HI>Mi&s;eries:</HI> But wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hout any prejudice to the <HI>Law,</HI> God Him&s;elf now <HI>Acquits</HI> us from that Condemnation and Obligation. 'Tis &s;aid&punc; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n Rom. 8.1. <HI>There is now no
<PB N="13" REF="000829_0013_0FAB405AA877E0E8">
Condemnation to them which are in Chri&s;t, Je&s;us.</HI></P>
<P>Yea, more than &s;o; Secondly; In the <HI>Forgivene&s;s of our Sins,</HI> the God of Hea|ven does Inve&s;t us with a <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> which is according to <HI>Law,</HI> the very <HI>Con|dition</HI> of Happine&s;s; Even a <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> which the <HI>Law</HI> has annexed <HI>Life Eternal</HI> as a <HI>Reward</HI> unto: a <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> which in all things does come up to the De|mands of the <HI>Law.</HI> 'Tis therefore &s;aid, in 2 Cor. 5.21. <HI>We are made the Righte|ou&s;ne&s;s of God.</HI></P>
<P>But, How comes this to pa&s;s? Third|ly; In the <HI>Forgivene&s;s of our Sins,</HI> the God of Heaven, graciou&s;ly <HI>Imputes</HI> unto us, the <HI>Obedience</HI> of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t. There was an <HI>Habitual Rectitude of Nature,</HI> which our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t was Born withal; There was a <HI>Cour&s;e of an Holy Life,</HI> which our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t Led for many years together; There was, La&s;tly, the Exqui&s;ite <HI>Pain,</HI> and <HI>Shame,</HI> and <HI>Horror,</HI> of the <HI>Cur&s;e</HI> due for Sin, Suffered by our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Now, God <HI>Imputes</HI> to us, all this <HI>Obedi|ence</HI> of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, in the <HI>For|givene&s;s of our Sins</HI>: That is to &s;ay; He

looks on it, as belonging unto <HI>Us,</HI> in or|der to our being Judicially dealt withal, according to the <HI>Merit</HI> of it. Hence, tho' it be our <HI>Duty</HI> &s;till our &s;elves to <HI>Obey</HI> the <HI>Law</HI> of God, and all our coming &s;hort thereof, is a <HI>Sin,</HI> for which we are to loath and judge our &s;elves, as worthy of <HI>Death</HI> for ever, yet we now <HI>Stand as with|out Fault before the Throne of God!</HI> This 'tis to be <HI>Forgiven our Iniquity.</HI></P>
<P N="2"><HI>II.</HI> By <HI>Faith</HI> in our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t&punc; and not <HI>Without Faith,</HI> and not <HI>Before Faith,</HI> is that <HI>Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s,</HI> the <HI>Forgivene&s;s of Sin,</HI> to be Attained.

the Righteou&s;ne&s;s which is of God by Faith</HI>&punc; Indeed, <HI>Faith</HI> does not <HI>Justify</HI> us, as it is a <HI>Work</HI>: 'Tis but <HI>Relatively,</HI> and <HI>Instru|mentally,</HI> that it <HI>Ju&s;tifies</HI> us. <HI>Faith,</HI> and only <HI>Faith,</HI> has the Honour, to <HI>Ju&s;tify</HI> us, becau&s;e it carries us unto our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t for our <HI>Ju&s;tification,</HI> and a&s;cribes unto the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t the Honour of it all. 'Tis true, we read, That <HI>Faith is Reckoned unto the Faithful for Righteou&s;|ne&s;s.</HI> One thing in it, may be; That tho' <HI>Faith</HI> be from the <HI>Operation of God</HI> upon us, yet God <HI>reckons</HI> it <HI>unto us, reckons</HI> it <HI>as our own,</HI> accepts it as <HI>our Act</HI>; el&s;e it could not bring the <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, or any thing el&s;e, to be <HI>ours.</HI> But when 'tis &s;aid, <HI>Faith is Reck|oned for Righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> 'tis the Object of our <HI>Faith,</HI> which is thereby intended; e|ven the <HI>Obedience</HI> of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, on which our <HI>Faith</HI> is placed.
