<OPENER><SALUTE>May it plea&s;e Your Excellency,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 paragraph"></P>
<P>And indeed while we Congratulate Your Excellency's Arrival unto this part of Your Government, We do but Congratulate our own Felicity, in having the Helm of the Government, by His Maje&s;ties Com|mi&s;&s;ion, put into the Hands of One, who is Adorned with so Charming an Image of His Own Royal Vertues.</P>
<P>His Maje&s;ty hath for ever obliged the Engli&s;h Nation, by His Royal A&s;&s;ent to tho&s;e Acts of Parliament, which have Enriched it with Ble&s;&s;ings richly worth all the Expences of the Late Happy Revolution. But Your Lord&s;hips Mo&s;t Generous, and Pro&s;perous Conduct, in labouring to bring about tho&s;e Acts, hath laid <HI>England</HI> under the &s;ame Obligation to Your Lord&s;hip, that <HI>Ireland</HI> hath to Your Illu&s;trious Ance&s;tors.</P>
<P>From doing of Benefits to the be&s;t I&s;land and Garden of the other Hae|mi&s;phere, Your Excellency is now come to be a Benefactor, unto the Continent of <HI>America,</HI> and Countries that have &s;ubdued an <HI>American</HI> Wil|derne&s;s, to be a &s;ignificant part of the <HI>Engli&s;h Empire.</HI></P>
<P>His Maje&s;ty in His Royal Wi&s;dom di&s;cerned, That the rare Temper, which qualifies Your Excellency, for the mo&s;t Honourable Undertakings, would be&s;t of all expre&s;s His own Gracious Intentions, to this part of His Dominions. And the Prudence and Goodne&s;s, with which Your Excellency hath managed the Affairs of <HI>New-York,</HI> is an actual Demon&s;tration of His Maje&s;ties Wi&s;dom in the Choice of an Healer for them.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="000872_0002_0FAC931D62D0FAA8">The Condition of <HI>Scotland,</HI> hath been &s;o con&s;ider'd by His Maje&s;ty, That He hath not only con&s;ented unto their Laws, which have E&s;tabli&s;hed their Church-Government, as 'tis now Reformed; but more than once or twice a&s;&s;ured them of His Re&s;olution to maintain that Church Govern|ment among them. This Greate&s;t of Monarchs that ever Sat on the Throne of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> and be&s;t of Kings at this Day Swaying a Scep|ter upon Earth, hath now given Your Excellency the Command over <HI>New-England</HI>; and a People that are a Nation of <HI>Non-Conformi&s;ts,</HI> which tho&s;e in <HI>Scotland</HI> ju&s;tly look upon as their <HI>United Brethren.</HI></P>
<P>Your Excellency expre&s;&s;ing &s;o much good will as You have done to the Late Act of Parliament, which hath made the Non-conformi&s;ts in <HI>England,</HI> Legal Parts of the Church in <HI>England</HI>; well knew what Hearty Friends, the va&s;t Body of <HI>Non-Conformi&s;ts</HI> are to the <HI>Engli&s;h Liberties</HI>; and what Loyal Subjects to the High and Mighty Prince, unto whom (under God) We are all Indebted, for the Recovery of tho&s;e Liberties; and how much an Union between all Good Men, whether Conformi&s;ts or Nonconformi&s;ts, will contribute unto the Strength of the Prote&s;tant Intere&s;t.</P>
<P>And we believe, That Your Excellency will on all occa&s;ions expre&s;s the good-will of a Common Father unto the Churches of <HI>Non-conformi&s;ts</HI> (if where they bear the proportion of more than One Hundred unto One, it be proper to call them <HI>So</HI>) in <HI>New-England</HI>: Churches wherein the pure Doctrine in the famous <HI>Articles</HI> of the <HI>Church of England</HI> is Own|ed and Preached with all po&s;&s;ible Purity; and the <HI>Primitive Di&s;cipline</HI> which even the Liturgy of the Church of <HI>England</HI> wi&s;heth to &s;ee Re&s;tored, is practi&s;ed.</P>
