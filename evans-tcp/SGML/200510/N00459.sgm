<PB N="2" REF="000582_0003_0FA7147902FAF080">
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> into Sin so that we stand in need of a pro|hibition with a Commination, as a Thorn-Hedge, to keep us within Compass, and let us know, that one great end of the Law, with respect to Fallen Man, is to be a Bridle to curb him in from his Exorbitancies; and withal signifies, that it is no little part of the work of Ministry, to Preach against Sin.</P>
<P>It is <HI>Davids</HI> observation&punc; Psal&punc; 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">9.96. <HI>I have seen an end of all Pers<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">ion, but thy Com|mand is exceeding broad.</HI> These <HI>ten words</HI> would make <HI>ten Volumns,</HI> if they were drawn out at length; each of them partakes in this quality, having a very great depth and fulness in it, as by the Rules given for ex|pounding of the Commandments, will easily be Evinced.</P>
<P>There is in every Command something that is expresly declared, and a great many more things that are necessarily included. This Rule is applicable to the <HI>third Command,</HI> which is the Subject of our present Conside|ration, as much as to any of the rest. The Command is given <HI>Negatively,</HI> and therefore speaks directly of a sin that is prohibited in it; though there are also many sins contain|ed under the prohibition; but my present business is only to speak of that which the words do in terms express.</P>
<P>Here then two things are to be observed.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="3" REF="000582_0004_0FA7147B44497150">1. The sin which is prohibited, and that is, <HI>Taking the Name of God in vain.</HI> The word Translated, <HI>Take,</HI> firstly signifies, to lift up a thing, and it nextly aims at the <HI>words</HI> of men, the taking up of Gods Name into their mouths; although it also extends to thoughts and deeds; but it is the for|mer that I am at present to take notice of. <HI>The name of God</HI> is of great extent, for it includes in it, every thing of God, in which he hath made any discovery of himself to the Creature: but more expresly it intends, any word by which the Great God is under|stood, whether <HI>Essentially</HI> or <HI>Personally</HI>; and so, every one of his <HI>Attributes,</HI> which are so many Letters in which he hath written his Name unto us, are here to be considered. The word, <HI>In vain</HI>; is sometimes used <HI>Sub|stantively,</HI> and then it signifies <HI>Temerity</HI> &amp; <HI>false|ness</HI>&punc; sometimes it is used <HI>Adverbially,</HI> and there it imports as much as, <HI>lightly, unnecessa|rily, unprofitably.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. The danger in committing of this sin is discovered, in a severe Commination. <HI>For the Lord will not hold him guiltless,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>The word that is translated, <HI>To hold guilt|less,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">gnifies in the first Conjugation, to be <HI>Pure, free, void</HI>; and in the Conjugation here used, it imports the treating of one as so;. It therefore aim<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> at <HI>Innocency</HI> in the

<P>Though this be not all, yet it is one thing plainly pointed at in this command and than which I scarcely know any thing that calls for a more solemn and severe Testimony to be b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rn against it; it being a sin that is not only practised by the openly profane sort of men, but is also too lamen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ably allowed in themselves by many that make an open pro|fession of God and his fear, as will be more than manifest when we have considered the nature of this sin distinctly. There are there|fore two thing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> to be enquired into;</P>
<P N="1">1. How or wherein men do incur the guilt of this sin? 2. what discovery may be made

of the grievousness o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> fearfulness of it?</P>
<P N="1">1. How or wherein men do incurr the guilt this sin?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> A Thing is then truly said to be done <HI>vainly,</HI> when it is to no good end or pur|pose; when there is no benefit or advantage that accrues to men by the doing of it; they neither profit themselves nor others: and consequently it is much more so, when it proves pernicious, and turns to a great deal of damage; Gods people are not to abstain from taking of his name into their mouths, but contrarily, they are to be often <HI>making mention</HI> of it; but they then do it&punc; <HI>vainly,</HI> when they do it after any other manner then is becoming. Now the ways by which men may bring themselves under the guilt of this sin, may be referred to two Heads: It is commited, either in their ordinary com|munication, or in and about Swearing.</P>
<P N="1">1. In their <HI>Ordinary Communication</HI> or discourse: and there are many respects in which men may be charged justly for taking the name of God vainly into their mouths on this account; I shall instance in some of them.</P>
<P N="1">1. By mentioning the Name of God with|out <HI>Reverend Thoughts</HI> of him: when men use this Name as a word of course, and have not together with it the aw of his Majesty

<P N="2">2. By using of his name in any suddain and ras<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>Exclama<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ions.</HI> If the former be a Sin a|gainst this Precept, this then must needs be so, for it is a proper fruit and result of it: <HI>Rashness</HI> &amp; <HI>Reverence</HI> cannot well be supposed to be consistent one with the other; for Re|verence will surely make men to deliberate, and to think before they will adventure to speak. There are some&punc; who upon every sudden vexation that is given them, or di|stress that comes upon them, will cry out, <HI>Oh Lord! Oh God</HI>! there are others that if any thing frighten them, or some unexpected trouble comes upon them at unawares, will earnestly say, <HI>Lord bless me, what shall I do</HI>! we have little reason to believe them, if they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hould tell us, that these are <HI>Ejaculatory

<P N="1">1. The Name of God is a <HI>great</HI> and a <HI>fearful</HI> Name, it must therefore be a very great Sin to offer any Affronts or Indignities unto it: we have these Epithets put upon it&punc; <HI>Deut.</HI> 28.58. <HI>this glorious and fearful Name, THE LORD THY GOD.</HI></P>

<P N="2">2.
