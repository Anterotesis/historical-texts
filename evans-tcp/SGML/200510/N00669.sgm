<P>This is it which the Prophet in our Text ob|&s;erves, to be the mi&s;erable ca&s;e of the State of <HI>Judah</HI>; They that once had Men of Piety, Wi&s;dom, Truth and Maje&s;ty, to adorn the Throne of Soveraignty, and Seats of Ju&s;tice, were brought to that deplorable pa&s;s, that they had not a &s;trong Rod to Rule them.

<P>There are two things (mutually illu&s;trating each the other) which from the&s;e words of the Prophet, may be recommended to your Con&s;ide|ration; and I hope not un&s;uitably to the pre|&s;ent Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t is, The much to be lamented Cir|cum&s;tances of a State or People, over whom, there are None&punc; or None &s;uch as there &s;hould be, holding the Reins of Authority, with a ju&s;t and &s;teady, &s;trong and impartial Hand: This is expre&s;&s;ed; This is it which the Prophet &s;o bewails.</P>
<P>The &s;econd is implied, <HI>viz.</HI> The Happine&s;s of a People who have <HI>Strong Rods, for Scepters to Rule them.</HI> And &s;o far as we &s;hall find, (in the

<P>This Chapter (wherein is our Text) doth contain a De&s;cription of the Pre&s;ent, with the next Preceding State of the Kingdom of <HI>Judah,</HI> (a&s;cending, as is generally concluded, as far as to the end of King <HI>Jo&s;iahs</HI> Reign) in a Twofold Parable.</P>
<P>The Fir&s;t, of a Lione&s;s and her Whelps, catching the Prey, and devouring until they&punc; were taken in the Pit. From <HI>ver&s;e</HI> 2. to the 9<HI>th</HI> inclu&s;ively.

<P>The Figurative Terms in the latter part of the ver&s;e are obvious; and need not much to be &s;aid for their Explication. I &s;hall add what is needful in a few words.</P>

So that by <HI>Rods,</HI> we are to under&s;tand Per&s;ons in Autho|rity; the Adjunct being put for the Subject.</P>
<P><HI>Scepter.</HI>] Is a word of the &s;ame Import: A <HI>Scepter</HI> is a Mark of Maje&s;ty and Severity which Kings of old, as well as now, were wont to u&s;e. Yet it is not to be re&s;trained to Kingly Domini|on only: (<HI>in Amos</HI> 1.8. It is u&s;ed concerning the State of the <HI>Phili&s;tines</HI> which was <HI>Ari&s;tocrati+cal</HI>:) And it &s;ignifieth, by the &s;ame <HI>Metonymie,</HI> any Power or Maje&s;ty, of Government or Rule, under what form or Name &s;oever. This then explaineth the former word; <HI>No Rods for a Scepter; i. e.</HI> Men in Authority, or Civil Govern|ment; for the Term <HI>Scepter</HI> is no where applied to any other kind of Government exerci&s;ed by Men over one another.</P>
<P><HI>To Rule.</HI>] The word is of great Extent, im|plies a Right and Authority over Per&s;ons and Actions, and whatever can be Governed: In a word, it comprehends here, whatever belongs to the Exerci&s;e of Civil Power: as to Enact Laws, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o a&s;&s;ure Rewards to the Obedient; to determine Penalties for the Di&s;obedient, and to di&s;tribute <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oth Rewards and Puni&s;hments. <HI>No Rod for a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cepter to Rule; i. e.</HI> Such were wanting as &s;hould

<P>But, How &s;o? Was not <HI>Zedekiah</HI> King? And had he not Officers under him? This Difficulty will ea&s;ily be removed, by con&s;idering the Quali|ty of the&s;e <HI>Rods</HI>; which the Prophet adds; and is principally to be taken notice of, and ob&s;erved here. <HI>Rods</HI> they had, but not <HI>Strong Ones.</HI></P>
<P><HI>No Strong Rod.</HI>] or Rod of &s;trength. Com|monly applyed to Kings &amp; Kingdoms, which are for the mo&s;t part, won and held thereby. This the Prophet adds to compleat the De&s;cription of tho&s;e, who&s;e help the &s;tate wanted: and that very agreeably with the Metaphor of a Rod or Staff, here u&s;ed. If a Staff have no &s;trength in it, it will prove but a Deceit, Cheat and Di&s;|appointment, to whom&s;oever make u&s;e of it: it is its &s;trength that makes it Serviceable. The &s;ame is true al&s;o, in this figurative u&s;e of the Word; or of tho&s;e whom the Prophet here &s;tileth Rods. What&s;oever is requi&s;ite to accom|pli&s;h Tho&s;e that bear Rule, that the &s;tate may &s;afely have dependance upon them; and without hazard lean upon their Conduct, whether it be Wi&s;dom, Ju&s;tice, Piety, Prowe&s;s; that is the &s;trength of the&s;e Rods, the Prophet here &s;peaks of. And it is evident, he &s;peaks of them under this Con&s;ideration (<HI>viz.</HI> as &s;o accompli&s;hed) for men in Authority there were; <HI>Zedekiah</HI> was now King; after him the King of <HI>Babylon</HI> ap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">pointed <HI>Gedaliah</HI> Governour; (the time was no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">

<P>Thus you have the Prophet's Repre&s;entation of their calamitous Circum&s;tances. Next follows his Reflection upon them. <HI>This is a Lamentation</HI>] It is a word that &s;ignifyeth the deepe&s;t <HI>Mourning,</HI> 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 1.16. But how was this a Lamentation?

<P>Let us nextly in a Word or two, con&s;ider the Second Branch of the De&s;cription: their <HI>Fidelity.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>They must be faithful in their Places.</HI> This is al&s;o requi&s;ite, to render Rulers &s;uch Ble&s;&s;ings to their People. If men hold Offices of never &s;o great Advantage to Serve the Publick, and are never &s;o well accompli&s;hed for them; yet, if they are not indu&s;trious to improve tho&s;e ac|compli&s;hments, and careful to make u&s;e of tho&s;e advantages; they not only do no Good them&s;elves, but (which is a double wrong) they take up the Room from, and &s;o prevent others, who have as good Qualifications, and would

make a good u&s;e of them. But (on the other hand) The Fidelity of Rulers crowns their Abi|lity, and makes it to be both &s;een and honoured of all.</P>
<P>Let me here in&s;tance in a few things, wherein this Fidelity of Rulers &s;hould, and will be di&s;co|vered. It will be &s;een in:</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>A &s;edulous applying them&s;elves to the Wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">k of their Office.</HI> The Apo&s;tle &s;aith, <HI>Rom.</HI> 12.8. <HI>He that ruleth, let him rule with Diligence.</HI> And it is as needful in Civil, as in any kind of Govern|ment. Whatever it is, that God calls us to Serve him in, we are to wait upon that thing. And a Heathen could &s;ay; <HI>Spartam quam nactus es, hanc orna.</HI> Civil Rulers are (by the Ordinance both of God and man) not only &s;et apart <HI>from,</HI> but &s;et <HI>above</HI> others, for a Special and Honourable Service; which cannot therefore with a good Con&s;cience be neglected. King <HI>Jeho&s;aphat</HI> gave this In&s;truction in &s;pecial, with the Commi&s;&s;ion he had granted to tho&s;e Judges that were to &s;et at Jeru&s;alem, 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 19.9. <HI>Thus ye &s;hall do</HI>: q. d. mind the thing that you have now in Commi&s;&s;i|on, and let it be done without fail. And for this rea&s;on, God hath provided, that &s;uch as thus Serve the Publick, &s;hould have not only the Honour of Reverence, but al&s;o of Tribute; <HI>Rom.</HI> 13.6. <HI>For this cau&s;e pay you Tribute al&s;o; for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hey are Gods Mini&s;ters, attending continually on this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">very Thing.</HI> That, as the former relates to the Dignity; &s;o the latter &s;hould honourably &s;up|port

them, and &s;upply the nece&s;&s;ities ari&s;ing from that attendance. Thus, the &s;ame right that Ru|lers have to the&s;e civil Dues, Tribute, or Salary, (call it by which name you plea&s;e) than which right, nothing can be more indi&s;putable, as being the expre&s;s command of God, <HI>Rom.</HI> 13.7; The &s;ame rea&s;on have they to attend to that Service which acquires it.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>A diligent Enquiry into all Cau&s;es depending before them.</HI> The Judges &s;aith <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> Deut. 19.18. <HI>&s;hall make diligent Inqui&s;ition</HI>; and <HI>Job</HI> &s;aith, <HI>chap.</HI> 29.16. <HI>The Cau&s;e that I knew not, I &s;earched out</HI>; yea, <HI>It is the Honour of a King to &s;earch out a matter.

<P>Some are wholly Swayed by the Favour they have received from, and the Friend&s;hip and Ac|quaintance they have with the&s;e and tho&s;e men; they think it but a point of Civility, to Vote for &s;uch as have been civil, kind, and obliging to them: But we ought to con&s;ider that our <HI>good Friends</HI> may be <HI>poor Patrons</HI> of the Common-Weal; they may be as bad Coun&s;ellers for the State, as <HI>Jobs</HI> were Comforters to him; Good men &s;hould have other ways to expre&s;s their Gratitude to their Friends, than by the publick Injury; and <HI>(if it mu&s;t needs be &s;o) we had bet|tor di&s;gu&s;t them, than do that which is wor&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>Some don't &s;o much con&s;ider the man, as the Party he belongs to; if he be but of &s;uch a &s;ort or &s;et of men, that is the principal Recommen|dation they look at; this alone is enough with them, to cover a multitude of Infirmities, and as many Sins; whereas the greate&s;t Worth, if it be on the other &s;ide, is wholly &s;lighted.</P>
<P>Some look at nothing &s;o much as Faction, and would with their good wills, have none to &s;way the Scepter of Government, but &s;uch as will be &s;ticklers for, and &s;trenuous promote<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s of, the <HI>Se|parate</HI> Intreagues, and private De&s;igns, which un|der the Countenance of Authority, they hope to drive on &s;ucce&s;sfully, again&s;t all that &s;hall oppo&s;e them.</P>
