<HEAD>A DISSWASIVE &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>_THE Vice of Intemperance is &s;uch an Enemy to all that is Virtuous and Religious in Man, yea, to all that is De|cent and Man-like, that all Mankind ought to ri&s;e up with Indignation again&s;t it, as a Thing that degrades them from the Honour of Human Nature, and renders them more vile than the very Bea&s;ts.</P>
<P>The poor &s;en&s;ele&s;s Brutes may by Ac|cident be overcome with &s;trong Liquors, becau&s;e they have no Rea&s;on to govern their Appetites, no Sen&s;e of Duty or Shame, no Fore&s;ight of Danger, nor Fear of a future Judgment: And when the Dog turns to his Vomit, or the Swine wallows in the Mire, they do but act according to their Nature. But for the noble Creature MAN, that is made after the Image of
<PB N="4" REF="040813_0003_10168C6D9423E628">
GOD, and ranked in Dignity next to the glorious Angels: Man, that has Rea&s;on to inform him in the Will of his Creator, and a Con&s;cience to awaken his Care to com|ply with it; yea, for a Chri&s;tian, that has the Vows of God upon him, and &s;tands fair for an eternal Kingdom; I &s;ay, for this wi&s;e and noble Creature to part with his Rea&s;on, his Con&s;cience, his Heaven; his God, for a little Drink more than he needs, yea, for &s;uch an Exce&s;s of it as tends to his pre&s;ent Pain, Di&s;order, and Shame, as well as to eternal Torment, is a mo&s;t de&s;perate Pitch of Sin and Folly, &s;uch as all People, when in their Sen&s;es, cannot choo&s;e but condemn even with Pa&s;&s;ion; and every body mu&s;t grant, that no Kindne&s;s in the VVorld can be more &s;ea&s;onable or more valuable, than that which tends to lift Men out of the Mire of this noi&s;ome Sin, and to bring them to the &s;weet and honourable E&s;tate of Chri&s;tian Sobriety.</P>
<P>And this is the VVork of our ble&s;&s;ed Religion, according to that Exhortation of the Holy Scriptures, <HI>Eph.</HI> v.18. <HI>Be not drunk with Wine, wherein is Exce&s;s; but be filled with the &s;pirit.</HI> As if it were &s;aid. Know your divine Advantages, ye
<PB N="5" REF="040813_0004_10168C72B2459160">
that live in the State of the Go&s;pel, and be not as Swine, which trample the riche&s;t Paerls under their Feet. Ye, who now Rave and Bla&s;pheme by Rea&s;on of Exce&s;s of Wine, may, by a due U&s;e of the Means of Grace, come to be filled with the holy Spirit, and to be happy in the Service and Favour of God, like the holy Angels. Wherefore con&s;ider the infinite Value of your heavenly Birthright, and do not &s;ell it, with <HI>E&s;au,</HI> for a few &s;en&s;ual Draughts, le&s;t, with him, when you come to &s;ee the Folly of it, ye weep bitterly, and perhaps eternally.</P>
<P>It is the Mi&s;ery of fallen Man, that his Soul is &s;unk into the Fle&s;h, and is prone to follow carnal Inclinations, yea, to <HI>make Provi&s;ion for the Fle&s;h, to fulfil the Lu&s;ts thereof</HI>; which is, both in Nature and Reli|gion, as ab&s;urd and horrible as for a Prince to wait on his Slave, or for a Man to be trampled under the Feet of his Hor&s;e. Now, it is the Work of Rea&s;on, Religion, and the Grace of God, to amend this Di&s;or|der, by reducing the lower Faculties of the Soul into a ju&s;t Obedience to the &s;uperior, and making both of them &s;ubject and obe|dient to the Will and Glory of God. And whereas &s;en&s;ual Plea&s;ures are the
<PB N="6" REF="040813_0005_10168C754E8CD698">
u&s;ual Baits whereby Men are en&s;nared to Intemperance, and as it were bewitched to it, thro' the Inordinacy and Folly of their fle&s;hly Minds, it is ab&s;olutely nece&s;|&s;ary to Salvation, that through the pow|erful A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the holy Spirit of God in the due Ob&s;ervance of the Go&s;pel Rules of Temperance, Ab&s;tinence, and Mortification, our Bodies &s;hould be kept in &s;uch Order and Regulation, that they may be fit In&s;truments of our Souls in our Endeavours to &s;erve and glorify God. And herein con&s;i&s;ts the Virtue and Grace of Sobriety, namely, in pre&s;cribing ju&s;t Bounds to &s;en&s;ual Plea&s;ure; that we be not drawn to Exce&s;s in Eating, Drinking, or other natural Actions, thro' the Entice|met of tho&s;e agreeable Plea&s;ures that at|tend them.</P>
<P>As to the particular Ca&s;e before us, that of Drinking to exce&s;s; it hath plea&s;ed God to make many Sorts of Liquors gu&s;tful and plea&s;ant to our Ta&s;te, that we might thereby be induced to acknow|ledge the Goodne&s;s of God, who gives us of his good Ceatures, as well for our Delight, as for our Nece&s;&s;ity. But here our Sobriety mu&s;t &s;tand on its Guard, to &s;ee that we keep to the Rules of Moderati|on,
<PB N="7" REF="040813_0006_10168C76D8F06E10">
and be not drawn to Exce&s;s by the Humour of the Company, or the Plea&s;ant|ne&s;s of the Liquor.</P>
<P>Our bountiful Creator has provided many Sorts of Wines, and other generous Liquors, for the Entertainment of Men, to be Cordials to us under the Indi&s;po&s;i|tions of our frail Bodies, and an Antidote to the over-heavy Afflictions which may befal us, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> civ.15. <HI>Prov.</HI> xxxi.6. In the&s;e Ca&s;es, Wine, and &s;uch like &s;pi|rituous Liquors, are of excellent u&s;e to the Conveniency of Human Life. And a Chri&s;tian is in this Re&s;pect more kindly dealt with than the <HI>Rechabite</HI> or <HI>Maho|metan.</HI> But here's the Mi&s;ery: What God has bountifully given us for good Ends, &s;en&s;ual Men abu&s;e to ba&s;e and per|nicious Purpo&s;es. VVhat God gives us for Chearfulne&s;s, Men abu&s;e to Drunken|ne&s;s and Exce&s;s&punc; and then our Cordial is turned into Poi&s;on, and our VVine into the Gall of A&s;ps: For where Drunk|enne&s;s prevails, all Virtue mu&s;t needs decay, and all Vice is in a VVay to thrive.</P>
<P>It is through the Preaches which this Sin hath made, that a great Part of that Flood of Sin, which all &s;ober People
<PB N="8" REF="040813_0007_10168C798B9A90D8">
complain of, has broken in upon us, And till this Vice cea&s;es to be modi&s;h and common, yea till it be duly expo&s;ed and &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, by the ju&s;t Execution of the Laws made for that Purpo&s;e, all other Ex|pedients of a Reformation of Manners will very much fail of their De&s;ign. And &s;ince &s;uch a Reformation would be the greate&s;t Ble&s;&s;ing that can come upon us, it will behove all wi&s;e and virtuous Per&s;ons to bring &s;uch Offenders to the Correction of the Magi&s;trate, as will not otherwi&s;e be reclaimed.</P>
<P>This Vice does a Per&s;on &s;o much Da|mage, both as a Man and as a Chri&s;tian, that where there is any degree of Sen&s;e, Rea&s;on, or Con&s;cience left, it mu&s;t needs make &s;ome Impre&s;&s;ion upon him, to con|&s;ider the Mi&s;chiefs which attend it.</P>
<P>But becau&s;e all Motives and Endeavours to repre&s;s this, or any other Vice, will be in vain, without the Efficacy of the Spirit of Holine&s;s, I be&s;eech the God of all Grace to accompany the following Con&s;iderations with his holy Spirit, that we may become mighty thro' his Grace, to &s;ilence the Excu&s;es, and mortify the In|clinations of Men to this Vice, and to rai&s;e in all that Read them, a mo&s;t vehement
<PB N="9" REF="040813_0008_10168C7D4A1BB908">
and la&s;ting Indignation again&s;t it. In or|der to which I &s;hall in the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> Place, con|&s;ider the Mi&s;chiefs it does us as Men, and in the <HI>&s;econd</HI> Place, the mi&s;chiefs it does us as Chri&s;tians.</P>
<P N="1">I. It injures us as we are Men, by de|priving us of the U&s;e of Rea&s;on, which is the Excellency and the very Di&s;tinction of Men from Brutes. The wi&s;e&s;t Per&s;on un|der the Di&s;order of Drink becomes a Fool, and commits a thou&s;and Vanities and In|di&s;cretions. The Drunkard has not the Speech, the Carriage, nor the Civility of a Man; but is wild, di&s;orderly, and ex|travagant.</P>
<P>Man, as he is rational and wi&s;e, bears the Image of God; but Intemperance blots out that divine Re&s;emblance; in &s;o much that the mo&s;t de&s;picable Creature, even a Dog, a Toad, a Serpent, bear more of the Image of God, than a drunken Man or Woman. For the&s;e Creatures, tho' mean, are what God made them; but a Per&s;on overcome with Drink, is altogether un|like to, and more contemptible than even the meane&s;t Creature of God's making. He has turned <HI>his Glory into the &s;imilitude of the Ox that eareth Gra&s;s,</HI> or rather of the <HI>Swine that wallows in the Mire.</HI> It is
<PB N="10" REF="040813_0009_10168C7ED712C4D0">
u&s;ually &s;aid of a Per&s;on in Drink that <HI>he is not him&s;elf</HI>; and it is true, for he does not act by the humane Principles of Rea|&s;on or Con&s;cience; but rather by the &s;or|did Appetites of a &s;hameles Bea&s;t, or the raving Fury of one that's po&s;&s;e&s;t by the Devil: So that he's no longer fit for hu|man Conver&s;ation, but is a meer Nu&s;ance and Di&s;turbance to all that are about him; the Grief of &s;ome, and the Laughter of others. And the be&s;t that can be done for him is, to lay him &s;omewhere out of the way, till Time and Sleep have reco|vered his lo&s;t Sen&s;es. And then &s;urely, when his Under&s;tanding returns to him, (as to <HI>Nebuchadnezzar</HI>) it will be as an Ar|row to his Brea&s;t, to think what a Bea&s;t he has been, and how many &s;hameful Pranks he has play'd.</P>
<P>And it is not only for the pre&s;ent that this Vice di&s;orders the Under&s;tanding, but the Cu&s;tom and Habit of it many times utterly be&s;ots Men, and makes them Chil|dren in Under&s;tanding even to their Death. Where Sen&s;uality is accu&s;tomed to domineer over Rea&s;on, it will at la&s;t e&s;tabli&s;h its Authority, and the Bea&s;t will exerci&s;e Dominion over the Man: Which leads us to a <HI>&s;econd</HI> Con&s;ideration.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="11" REF="040813_0010_10168C818FCC6348">II. This Vice makes People vile and contemptible in the Sight of all Men: Even their Servants and Inferiors deride and contemn them, and the very Boys in the Streets make their Sports with them. Their ridiculous Behaviour moves the Laughter of vain People; whil&s;t others, who con&s;ider the Matter better, cannot but mourn over the poor be&s;otted Crea|ture, and are a&s;hamed that he &s;hould be thought their Friend, or their Acquaint|ance. And indeed what Sight can be &s;adder, than to &s;ee one, that is made capable of Communion with God, render|ed unfit for Society with Men; and to &s;ee a Man &s;elling the Honour and Dignity of his Nature, and his hopes of eternal Bli&s;s, for the Plea&s;ure of a little Liquor, whil&s;t it is running over his Tongue. By this many Per&s;ons of Character and Di&s;tincti|on do make them&s;elves vile and mean, and they lo&s;e the Re&s;pect which would otherwi&s;e be due unto them.</P>
<P N="3">III. The Vice of Intemperance enflames Men's bea&s;tial Lu&s;ts and Pa&s;&s;ions, and lays their Rea&s;on a&s;leep, which ought to guard them. And then there will be much the &s;ame Di&s;order, as when wild Beasts have &s;lain their Keeper, and are got loo&s;e.
<PB N="12" REF="040813_0011_10168C831A3E8180">
For indeed the Ca&s;e is much the &s;ame, where unmortified Lu&s;ts and Pa&s;&s;ions are heightened by &s;trong Liquors, and no Rea&s;on nor Con&s;cience is left to curb and controll them. Hence comes Impu|dence and Shamele&s;&s;ne&s;s in the mo&s;t un|&s;eemly Sins; like fed Hor&s;es, they pro|claim the Impurity of their Hearts, and the Fury of their Lu&s;ts, in the very Streets, as well as when they <HI>a&s;&s;emble by Troops in the Hou&s;es of Harlots,</HI> (Jer. v. 7.) Even &s;o good a Man as <HI>Lot,</HI> when overcome with Wine, had utterly lo&s;t all Regard to Decency and Honour; and in this Di&s;or|der, even <HI>Noah</HI> him&s;elf behaved un&s;eem|ly.</P>
<P N="4">IV. It expo&s;es Per&s;ons to cau&s;le&s;s Broils and Quarrels. Many People fall out in their Cups, they know not why nor how; in&s;omuch that the wi&s;e Man would have it taken notice of as a Thing common to a Proverb, that he who &s;its long, till <HI>Wine inflame him</HI> and his Com|panions, is like to <HI>have Wounds without Cau&s;e,</HI> (Prov. xxiii.20.) When the Spirits of men are fired by immoderate Drinking, they &s;oon blaze out into a Pa&s;&s;ion at the lea&s;t Affront, tho' but an imaginary one; and then the Blood of the Party is often
<PB N="13" REF="040813_0012_10168C8839680F68">
&s;hed to quench it. How many Murthers have been committed at Taverns, within a few Years? And how great will the Cry be for Vengeance, where two &s;uch Sins as Drunkenne&s;s and Murther call at once to Heaven for Ju&s;tice? How often have Men killed their neare&s;t Relations or deare&s;t Friends in their Drink, for which they have been ready to kill them&s;elves when they came to reflect upon it in their &s;ober Thoughts? It was in &s;uch a De|bauch as this that <HI>Alexander</HI> killed <HI>Clitus,</HI> one of the deare&s;t and faithfulle&s;t Friends he had; and that for doing one of the kinde&s;t Office&s; of Friend&s;hip, that is, Re|proving.</P>
<P N="5">V. In the next Place, it creates divers kinds of <HI>Di&s;ea&s;es,</HI> and makes this pre&s;ent Life both &s;hort and painful. For exce&s;&s;ive Drinking brings Surfeits,&mdash;Fevers,&mdash;Drop|&s;ies,&mdash;Pal&s;ies,&mdash;an aching Head,&mdash;an ill Stomach, and what not? Some indeed, that are of a &s;trong Con&s;titution, may bear up longer than others under the Di&s;order it brings to their Bodies; but to all it is Poi&s;on, tho' it works more &s;lowly upon &s;ome than others; and it fails not in the End to bring down their Heads with <HI>Sor|row to the Grave.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="040813_0013_10168C8AE221C330">It has long been ob&s;erved, and it is, alas! too manife&s;t, that if the Sword has &s;lain its Thou&s;ands, Intemprance has &s;lain its Ten Thou&s;ands: And in many of tho&s;e who make a &s;hift to outlive the common Practice of it, we &s;ee &s;uch mani|fe&s;t Decays of their Strength, Vigour, Wit, and Sen&s;e, that God &s;eems to hang them up alive in Chains, to affright others from &s;uch ill Cour&s;es. The good God per|&s;wade all that are concerned to take War|ning thereby.</P>
<P N="6">VI. A Per&s;on in the Di&s;order of Drink is unable to &s;hun the mo&s;t apparent Dan|ger. His Eyes are bemi&s;ted, that he can|not di&s;cern the Danger of a Pit or Preci|pice that lies before him, nor know his Friend from his Enemy. How many have fallen from their Hor&s;es, or tumbled into Pits, or fallen into Ponds, or been burnt in their Beds, in a Fit of Intempe|rance? Yea, their own Weakne&s;s &s;eems to threaten their Life; they reel and &s;tag|ger like an Infant; they &s;tumble at every Stone that lies in their Way, and are ready to fall to their Ruin. And if by the&s;e, or any &s;uch Accidents, they come by their Death, in what a woful Condition mu&s;t they appear before God, having
<PB N="15" REF="040813_0014_10168C8C6F30EEC0">
died in the very Act of abu&s;ing His Mer|cies, and tran&s;gre&s;&s;ing His Will?</P>
<P N="7">VII. It begets in them a Contempt of Sobriety and &s;ober Per&s;ons. The P&s;al|mi&s;t complains that he was the <HI>Song of the Drunkards,</HI> (P&s;al. lxix.12.) When <HI>Na|bal</HI> was in his Wine, he railed upon <HI>Da|vid</HI> the Anointed of God, as if he were a Run-away from his Ma&s;ter, (1 <HI>Sam.</HI> xxv.10.)</P>
<P>I might add, that it cau&s;es People to be impo&s;ed upon in their Dealings, and renders them a Prey to every de&s;igning Cheat. It makes them unfit for any Tru&s;t, and for any publick Office in Coun|cil or War. It al&s;o bla&s;ts their Reputati|on and E&s;teem in the World; for there's &s;carce any Name more infamous than that of a Sot, or a common Drunkard.</P>
<P>And after all, 'tis a very wa&s;teful Vice; it is never maintained but by unnece&s;&s;ary Expence, great Wa&s;te of Time, and Ne|glect of Bu&s;ine&s;s. How many &s;tarve the Backs and Bellies of their Families, to maintain this expen&s;ive Vice? In&s;omuch that <HI>Solomon</HI> makes it a Proverb, that the <HI>Drunkard and the Glutton &s;hall come to Po|verty,</HI> (Prov. xxiii.21.)</P>
<P>Thus we &s;ee &s;ome of the Mi&s;chiefs of
<PB N="16" REF="040813_0015_10168C8F06E59830">
this Vice to us as Men: But alas! The one Half of its Damages is not yet ca&s;t up; for if we look on this Sin, with the enlightened Eyes of a Chri&s;tian, we &s;hall &s;ee far greater Mi&s;chiefs done by it. For,</P>
<P N="1">1. It drives away the Holy Spirit of God. This is taught us by the Apo&s;tle in the Scripture before mentioned, <HI>Eph.</HI> v.18. <HI>Be not drunk with Wine, wherein is Exce&s;s; but be filled with the Spirit.</HI> Where the dis-junctive Particle [<HI>but</HI>] &s;hews us, that we cannot enjoy both together. Our Exce&s;s will drive away our Sanctifier and Comforter. He is too delicate to dwell with the na&s;ty &s;pewing Drunkard. <HI>For what Communion hath Light with Darkne&s;s? or Chri&s;t with Belial?</HI> 2 Cor. vi.15. Sure|ly, if any de&s;erve the Name of Sons of <HI>Be|lial,</HI> (that is, Men without Yoke, Re&s;traint, or Government) the&s;e are the Per&s;ons; for they are the mo&s;t rude and ungovern|able of all others. And be&s;ides,</P>
<P N="2">2. This Vice unfits us for every &s;piritu|al and religious Action. The poor be&s;ot|ted Wretch cannot &s;o much as think one &s;ober Thought, or receive any Good by the pious Advice of others. What Order can there be in that Family, where the Ma&s;ter of it is Drunk? Is &s;uch a one fit to <PB N="17" REF="040813_0016_10168C91F8130E88">
pray with his Family, or to in&s;truct them in the Duties of Religion! May he not tremble to touch any holy Thing in &s;uch a polluted Condition? Has he not rea&s;on to dread the Vengeance of a Holy God upon &s;uch a di&s;orderly Aproach to Him? <HI>Nadab</HI> and <HI>Abihu,</HI> the Prie&s;ts, the Sons of <HI>Aaron,</HI> are &s;uppo&s;ed to have drank too much when they offered <HI>&s;trange Fire</HI> before the Lord; becau&s;e it is imediately added, <HI>Lev.</HI> x.9, 10. That neither <HI>Aaron, nor his Sons, &s;hould drink any Wine nor &s;trong Drink, when they went into the Tabernacle, le&s;t they die for it.</HI> It was always held as an Abo|mination to carry Swine's Fle&s;h into the Temple; which &s;eems to teach us, that all Per&s;ons of impure and ungoverned Appe|tites, are utterly unfit for Communion with the Holy God.</P>
<P N="3">3. This Vice does very &s;adly wa&s;te the Con&s;cience. It is of a dulling, be&s;otting Nature: It drowns all &s;erious Thought and Reflection, where it grows to a Habit. How many have gone out at this Door into all Exorbitancies and Debauchery? It often betrays Men to profane Swearing Lying, Pa&s;&s;ions, filthy Language and Acti|ons, and to any III. He is (as <HI>Solomon</HI> &s;ays) like <HI>one that lieth on the Top of a Ma&s;t,</HI>
<PB N="18" REF="040813_0017_10168C95B4600908">
in which Ca&s;e he cannot &s;tir, without en|dangering his Life, <HI>Prov.</HI> xxiii.34&punc; &s;o a Per|&s;on that is Drunk, will be like to do every thing ami&s;s that he &s;ets him&s;elf to, and to be overcome by every Temptation that lies in his VVay.</P>
<P N="4">4. Intemperance pulls down dreadful Wrath upon the Per&s;on that is guilty of it, in this Life, and that to come. The Book of God is &s;o full of Woes again&s;t it, that they appear like a Multitude of Spears &s;et in array again&s;t the Per&s;on that treads in this forbidden Path. <HI>Wo to the Crown of Pride, the Drunkards of Ephraim,</HI> I&s;a. xxviii.1. <HI>Wo unto them that ri&s;e up early in the Morning that they may follow &s;trong Drink, that continue until Night, till Wine inflame them,</HI> I&s;a. v.11. <HI>Wo unto him that giveth his Neighbour Drink, that putte&s;t thy Bottle to him, and make&s;t him drunken al&s;o, that thou may&s;t &s;ee his Naked|ne&s;s. Thou art filled with Shame for Glory; the Cup of the Lord's right Hand &s;hall be tur|ned unto thee, and &s;hameful Spewing &s;hall be on thy Glory,</HI> Hab. ii.15. <HI>No Drunkard &s;hall inherit the Kingdom of God,</HI> 1 Cor. vi.10. Surely, where there is not perfect Infidelity, the&s;e Terrors of the Lord will in &s;ome mea&s;ure over-awe Men. For it is
<PB N="19" REF="040813_0018_10168C97441D7780">
very di&s;mal to con&s;ider thro' what crooked and unea&s;y Paths they pa&s;s on to the Place of Everla&s;ting Torment; where their Mouths will probably be parched with greater Heat than others, in Proportion to their former Exce&s;&s;es, and they will for ever want a Drop of cold VVater to cool their Tongues. And then, it will be but little Comfort to think of the Bottles and Barrels that they have drank in wa&s;te in their former Life; yea, that very Thought will for ever give Fuel to their Flames.</P>
<P>Let tho&s;e that are &s;trong to drink VVine, or &s;trong Drink, con&s;ider this; and &s;uch as entice or compel others to drink more than is fit. It is &s;o natural to leave every one to his Liberty in this Point, that a Heathen Emperor provided for it by the Law, <HI>E&s;th.</HI> i.8. <HI>The Drinking</HI> (at a mo&s;t generous Entertainment) <HI>was accor|ding to the Law; none did compel.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e Things being con&s;idered, we e|ven be&s;eech Men, by all that is dear to them in both VVorlds, to di&s;dain a ba&s;e Vice, which adds &s;o much to their pre&s;ent Re|proach and Damage, and to their eternal Torment and Confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>VVe per&s;wade you by the Love ye bear your&s;elves, <HI>my Brethren,</HI> as ye de&s;ire the
<PB N="20" REF="040813_0019_10166531B0D9D818">
Continuance of your pre&s;ent Life and Health; as you regard the Honour of Human Nature, or tender your Reputati|on, that you abhor a Vice, which de&s;troys all the&s;e Enjoyments.</P>
<P>Yea, we entreat you by that which ought to be dearer to you than your Lives, even by the Love and Fear of the great and good God, as you value his Fa|vour, and would not fall under his ever|la&s;ting Vengeance, that you would in&s;tant|ly di&s;card this de&s;tructive Vice, and that you would <HI>watch</HI> and be <HI>&s;ober.</HI></P>
<P>Come out of the &s;en&s;ele&s;s Amu&s;ements of this be&s;otting Sin, <HI>my Brother</HI>; &s;hun the Company, the Drink, and the Occa|&s;ion which leads you into this Snare, and thereby into the bottomle&s;s Pit. Look up to Heaven, I be&s;eech you, before it be utterly lo&s;t; frequent the Company of good and &s;ober People, and entreat them to watch over you, and to admoni&s;h you in the Lord; and above all, beg the graci|ous Conduct of God's Holy Spirit, by ear|ne&s;t and continual Prayer; and be &s;ure to frequent all God's holy Ordinances, and to improve all good Motions put into your Heart from above. And think often upon the Mi&s;chiefs of this Sin in both VVorlds,
<PB N="21" REF="040813_0020_10168C9F15578810">
with an awakened Expectation of a Judg+ment to come.</P>
<P>But if our mo&s;t affectionate Per&s;wa&s;ives take no Place upon you, we mu&s;t then, in pure Affection to you, try the Power of other Re&s;traints; as we deal with our be&s;t Friends, when they are bereaved of the Use of their Rea&s;on. And we cannot but entreat all &s;ober Per&s;ons, as they would do you Good, or do Honour to God, that they would put you to Shame before the Magi&s;trate, to re&s;train you from de&s;troying your&s;elf, and pulling down Calamities and Judgments upon the Publick. If you &s;aw a Per&s;on in a furious or drunken Fit, ca&s;ting Fire-brands upon all the Hou&s;es he came near, you would think all tho&s;e People worthy of great Blame that did not lay hold on him, and bring him to Justice. And in very Truth, every &s;candalous Tran&s;gre&s;&s;or does greater Mi&s;chief to his Neighbour; for by Rea&s;on of the&s;e Things, where they abound without con|troll, the righteous Judgments of God come upon a Land, 'till it be made a Re|proach and a De&s;olation.</P>
<P>Upon the Whole: If no Entreaty nor Affliction upon Earth will reclaim this exce&s;&s;ive Lover of his Drink, a very
<PB N="22" REF="040813_0021_10168CA0A0A45E78" MS="y">
&s;hort Time will convince him of the Un|rea&s;onablene&s;s and &s;ad Con&s;equence of &s;o doing; even when he &s;hall receive a Summons by &s;ome Di&s;ea&s;e, or &s;ome &s;ud|den Accident, (perhaps of his own pro|curing) to appear before his great and terrible Judge: Then will a Cup of Trim|bling be put into his Hands, as in the Ca&s;e of <HI>Bel&s;hazzer,</HI> and he mu&s;t drink of the Cup of God's VVrath for ever. Then will the mo&s;t be&s;otted VVretch begin to think &s;oberly both of Vice and Virtue; and cry out of the Folly of plea&s;ing him&s;elf in that &s;otti&s;h VVay of Life, which fir&s;t robbed him of his Rea|&s;on, then of his Con&s;cience, then of his God, and then of his Heaven.</P>
