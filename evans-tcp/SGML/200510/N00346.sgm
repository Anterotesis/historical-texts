Except the Lord build the house, they labour in vain that build it.</HI> Our em|ployments cannot benefit or satisfie us, unless the Lord influence them, Mat. <HI>4.4. Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God,</HI> Hag <HI>1.6.

<P>To help in this great case is the scope of the ensuing exhor|tation&punc; a word spoken in season, like Apples of Gold in pictures of silver, the worth, beauty, and pleasantness whereof bespeaks its acceptance at the first view. A Subject of general concern|ment, wherein there is counsel for the Ruler, and instruction to all the people. Hear ye me <HI>Asa, and all Judah</HI> and <HI>Benja|min</HI>: The Lord is with you while ye are with him; a weighty word in which we are not dealt with all about <HI>mint</HI> and <HI>annis,</HI> but life and death are set before us. Moreover the timing of this instruction seemeth to carry with it somthing of parti|cular Remarks&punc; The message sent us the last year, upon the like day and occasion, was as is known. <HI>Be thou instructed O Jerusalem, least my soul depart from thee, least I make thee desolate, a Land not inhabited.</HI> And now hear ye me <HI>Asa,</HI> and all Judah and Benjamin, the Lord is with you while ye be with him, and if you seek him he will be found of you, but if ye forsake him, he will forsake you. These are solemn treatments from the God of Heaven: Shall the hope of Israel, the Lord God of our fathers speak so much about leaving us, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and order in the way of his Providence, that his word be left upon record, and published to the view of all, and shall not we lay it to heart. Alas should poor <HI>New-England</HI> lose the presence of God, what would be left us but shame and misery. How precious a name is Jehovah-Shammah, Honourable enough to be engraven on the gates of Heaven: hath not this been written in legible though in smaller letters, on the Land on

which we live, and shall we provoke the holy God to rase it out and write upon us Jchabod instead thereof. O foolish people, not wise.</P>
<P>But I know the way of man is not in himself, so perverted are we by nature, that until a day of power comes down upon us, our hearts will not encline to God, and yet he needeth not to be beholden to us; he can make himself wellcome when he pleaseth, our hearts are in his hands as the Rivers of waters. He can prepare us for himself, and dwell with us in abundance of mer|cy. O Lord though our iniquities testifie against us; do it for thy Names sake.</P>

<P>The Lord is with you while ye are with Him.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>TO make a little way to to these Words, with what is intended in and from them, I will only mind you of some Remarkables the holy Story mentions, concerning <HI>Asa</HI> King of <HI>Judah,</HI> viz. (1.) <HI>That he was sincerely godly, a perfect and upright man</HI>: though he had his faults (as there is no man that sinneth not) and fell sadly sundry wayes, towards the close of his time, as may be seen, <HI>Chap.</HI> 16.1, 10. Yet it is said of him in way of commen|dation, <HI>Chap.</HI> 15.17. <HI>Nevertheless the heart of Asa was perfect all his dayes</HI>: not only he did that which was right in the eyes of the Lord his God, <HI>Chap.</HI> 14.2. but he did it like a Saint, as did <HI>David</HI> his Father, 1 <HI>King.</HI> 15.11. And thence also it stands Recorded concerning <HI>Jeho|saphat</HI> his Son and Successor, <HI>That he walked in the way of</HI> Asa <HI>his Father, and departed not from it, doing that which was right in the sight of the Lord,</HI> Chap. 20.32. (2.) That as an effect and evidence of <HI>Asa's</HI> sincerity, he was en|gaged in that good work of Reforming Church and State, or a diligent endeavour to mend what was amiss
<PB N="2" REF="000421_0007_0FA5AA017336FA28">
in Religious or Civil respects, <HI>Chap</HI> 14.3, 8. fot he took away the Altars of the strange gods, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> (3) That he met with disturbance by the endeavours of some of his evil-minded neighbours, <HI>Chap.</HI> 14.9. The <HI>Arabians,</HI> that were near borderers upon the land of <HI>Canaan,</HI> made War against him. (4.) That a famous and even full victory was given him against that multitude of enemies, by the power and goodness of God, <HI>Chap</HI> 14.10, to the end. (5.) That in their return from the vanquishment of those adversaries; there was a solemn and incouraging message sent them; Wherein may be minded,</P>
<P N="1">1. By whom the message was sent, <HI>Chap.</HI> 15.1. God (the spirit of God) was the Author, and <HI>Azariah</HI> the hand that conveyed it.</P>
<P N="2">2. To whom the Message was delivered, <HI>ver.</HI> 2. <HI>Hear ye me Asa and all Judah and Benjamin</HI>; The Leader and the People, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> the Chief and his followers.</P>
<P N="3">3. The Message it self, or matter of it, which is sum|marily presented in the remainder of the second verse, and then is further illustrated and inlarged to <HI>ver.</HI> 7. In this second verse, we have the main sum of the message that was sent: and therein <HI>First,</HI> a general proposition set down. <HI>The Lord is with you while ye are with him. Se|condly,</HI> That general is explained and amplified by two particulars presented, the one in way of promise, <HI>If ye seek him he will be found of you</HI>; the other in way of threat|ning, <HI>But if you forsake him, he will forsake you.</HI> It is the middle clause of the verse (or the general conclusion
<PB N="3" REF="000421_0008_0FA5AA02C97900C8">
therein declared) That I intend to propose a few words from, upon the present occasion: Not to spend time in explaining the terms: I come immediately to the Do|ctrine, which may be thus Delivered;
<Q><HI>DOCTRINE.</HI> That while a People are with God, He also is with them;</Q></P>
<P>Or thus,
<Q>The Lord without fail is and will be with his People when or while they are with Him.</Q></P>
<P>The Lord is with you while ye are with him.</P>
<P>The Words (as is observed by some) may be re|ferred to time past, present or to come; and so rendred indifferently, <HI>The Lord hath been,</HI> is, he will be with you upon your being with him.</P>
<P>To unfold and confirm the Truth mentioned, three things may be minded as matter of enquiry, <HI>viz.</HI> What it is for a people to be with God: and what for God to be with them? and then whence or on what account He will be with them while they are with Him.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="000421_0009_0FA5AA02F14A87C0">Quest. <HI>What it is for a people to be with God?</HI> Two things seem to carry the sence or sum of it, or there are two ways of a peoples being with God: <HI>viz.</HI> In their hearts and in their lives:</P>
<P>First, To be with him in their hearts: when the heart is right in his sight, and found faithful before him, as is said of <HI>Abraham,</HI> Nehem. 9:8. <HI>And foundest his heart faithful before thee:</HI> There is a fixed heart-adherence to him; as the good man gave the exhortation, Acts 11 23. <HI>That with purpose of heart they would cleave unto the Lord.</HI> That with a stedfast immoveable decree of heart they should stick close to him; that nothing that they were to meet with, might work a separation, or set them at distance again: And thus to be with him in heart, is by faith, love and fear.</P>
<P N="1">1. Faith in him. As unbelief separates, holds or sends away the heart: The direct, natural, proper ten|dency and work of it is a heart-departure from God, Heb. 3.12 <HI>An evil heart of unbelief in departing from the living God;</HI> unbelief makes the heart stand off and go away from God and Jesus Christ; so faith carries it to him; it is oftentimes called coming, John. 6.35. co|ming or believing are mentioned as the same thing; faith is the souls motion or making out to God in Christ: And then it keeps the heart with him. The propriety of it some not unmeetly express to be a t<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">ing by the Heart-strings to him: The heart so stays upon him as to stay with him, makes its stand there. This was one way of <HI>Asa</HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">s being with God, as the Seer said to him, 2 Chron. 15.8. <HI>Because thou didst rely upon the
<PB N="5" REF="000421_0010_0FA5AA03B6439618">
Lord</HI>: His heart got near to him in a time of need&punc; and so himself in the same case, 2 Chron. 4.11. <HI>Help us O Lord our God, for we rest on thee.</HI> He expresseth his faith in prayer, which is the proper language of it: The prayer of faith&mdash;Faith in prayer brings the heart into his presence, but prayer without faith is like a bird with|out wings, that cannot get upwards to any purpose, but falls to the ground: Faith is always a necessary ingredi|ent, one of the main requisites of right prayer: There is a must put upon it: <HI>Hebrews</HI> 11.6. <HI>He that cometh to God, must believe that he is</HI>&mdash;They that would come to God, so as to be with him indeed, must have faith to lead and lift their hearts home to him; Faith in his power and grace and faithfulness, <HI>James</HI> 1.6. <HI>But let him ask in Faith:</HI> There will be defects <HI>q d.</HI> do what you can, but be sure faith be not wanting, as you would get any thing by all your askings: Let not such an one (that <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> not in faith, that is, think that he shall re|ceive any thing of the Lord, <HI>verse</HI> 7.</P>
<P N="2">2 Love to him; heartily and in good earnest to com|ply with the first and great Commandment, as our Sa|viour gives it, Mat. 22.37, 38. <HI>Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind;</HI> this is the first and great Commandment&punc; That the whole soul in all the faculties and powers of it, center and terminate upon him, as the alone adequate satisfying object of it. It is a great and precious pro|mise, that is herein made, Deut. 30.6. <HI>The Lord thy God will circumcise thine heart, and the heart of thy seed, to love the Lord thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, that thou mayest live.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="000421_0011_0FA5AA048BAC01B0">Blessed things might be obtained, could we improve and press it for our selves and ours as we ought; The love of all the heart belongs to him alone, and so not to be laid out upon any other. The truth is, not to love him above all, is not to love him at all; unless he hath best love, he hath none indeed; which is the import of that of the Apostle, 1 John 2 15. <HI>If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him.</HI> Know assu|redly, and believe it alwayes, That the worlds leavings do not belong to God: It is downright Idolatry (Spi|ritually so I mean) when any thing in us of the world is set above him in the esteem and indearments of the heart; when the choice and chief of mans love is be|stowed upon creature objects, and the refuse only reser|ved for him, <HI>Mat.</HI> 10.37. As he is the chiefest good, so thence also he indispensibly demands highest love, as alwayes his due; nor will any thing less or lower than that, find acceptance with him.</P>
<P N="3">3 Fear of him, which as it is his undeniable right: <HI>He ought to be feared,</HI> Psal. 76.11 the only object of re|ligious fear: His right therein arises from all the disco|veries he makes of himself; every letter of his name be|speaks it, Psal. 111.9. <HI>Holy, and to be feared is his name</HI>: In special from his absolute soveraignty, Job. 25.2 <HI>Do|minion and fear are with him</HI>: dominion upon the account whereof he is to be feared. As some do, and all should fear him; So indeed all shall do it one way or other ere he hath done; such a day is coming, as will force the fearless ones to fear, Isa. 2.12, 3.4. <HI>For the day of the Lord of Hosts shall be upon every one that is proud and lof|ty&mdash;and upon all the Cedars of Lebanon&mdash;and upon all the
<PB N="7" REF="000421_0012_0FA5AA052EFE8098">
Oaks of</HI> Bashan, and <HI>upon all the high mountains, and upon all the hills that are lifted up:</HI> Not only the little low shrubs, but the stately Cedars and sturdy Oaks; not only the mole hills but the mountains; man <HI>i. e.</HI> in their greatest heights and opposition to him: The Lord of Hosts hath a day to make them all stoop and tremble before him, as it follows, <HI>verse</HI> 17. <HI>The loftiness of man shall be bowed down, and the haughtiness of man shall be made low</HI>&mdash;And verse 19. <HI>They shall go into the holes of the Rocks, and into the caves of the earth, for fear of the Lord, and for the glory of his Majesty, when he ariseth to shake terribly the earth:</HI> There is such authority and power appears in all his works as commends fear, Psal. 66.3. Say unto, God, how terrible art thou in thy works? And eminently his dealings with man, verse 5. <HI>He is terrible in his doings towards the children of men</HI>: All sorts of men, <HI>Psal.</HI> 76.12. He shall cut off the Spirit of Princes: He is terrible to the Kings of the earth; He is terrible out of his holy places, in the execution of judg|ments denounced by his Word, and the <HI>Ministry</HI> of it. Thus he is to be feared for his soveraign power, Jer. 5.22. It is a fearful thing for man, less then nothing man, <HI>not to fear the great God, Jer.</HI> 10 7. His excellent great|ness (that hath all the world at command, to do what he will, in and with it) and so does his exceeding good|ness, Jer. 5.24. &mdash; Hos. 3.5.&mdash;And as fear is his right, so it must be rendred to him: Wo to that Plantation, Co|lony or Country, of which it may be said, The fear of God is not in this place: it may be there are fair houses, large fields, full Shops and Barns, but if the fear of God be not there among the rest, their condition is exceed|ing
<PB N="8" REF="000421_0013_0FA5AA05F4B433E8">
woful: Suppose a person or a people to be as rich as may be in the things of this world, they are poor not|withstanding, miserably poor, if the fear of the Lord is not their treasure, as the word is, Isa. 33.6 Be there never so much farming and merchandize, buying and selling, and gain got by it&punc; it is not such wealth can make us rich indeed, while the fear of God is wanting: You may see how much weight he lays upon his fear, in that he hath made it one of the main grants of the E|verlasting Covenant, Jer. 32.40. <HI>I will put my fear in their hearts</HI>&mdash;It is not naturally there, no more than Faith or Love, nor can all the world lay it in to purpose, that is his peculiar work; <HI>I will put my fear in their hearts, that they shall not depart from me.</HI> Though there are warpings of corruptions within, and workings of temptations without; sin swayes and Satan shams, yet they shall not be carried away; The fear of God in their hearts so holds them to and with him, that they shall not wickedly depart, or allow themselves in wand|ring from him. But that is the first head, one way of a peoples being with God, is in their hearts, by faith in, love to, and fear of him.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Another way of a peoples being with him, is in their lives; to follow his work, and walk in his wayes, carefully avoiding what is contrary, and attend|ing what is according to his Word, and the Revelations of his mind made in it: and that both wayes, As to his Will in general, and his Worship in particular.</P>

common prudence, But still 'tis his prerogative to resolve and order in what way, or by what means we shall wor|ship him.

They promised fair when they were under the pang and impulse of their fear, through those awful appearances that were made upon mount Sinai, at the delivery of the Law, <HI>ver</HI> 27. <HI>They said to Moses, Speak thou unto us, all that the Lord our God shall speak to thee, and we will hear it, and do it,</HI> verse 28. <HI>The Lord heard the voice of their words, and said, they have well said all that they have spo|ken</HI>; they give me good words, Oh that they would do as they say: Oh that there were such a heart in them, that they would fear me, and keep all my Command|ments alwayes, that it might be well with them and their Children for ever: To keep such a course, is the way to perpetuate a peoples welfare; And this is al|wayes man<HI>'s</HI> duty, <HI>Eccles</HI> 12.13. <HI>Fear God and keep his Commandments, for this is the whole duty of man.</HI> But so

likewise as to this part of obedience, in particular, his Worship, it must be heartily attended; heartless services signifie not, <HI>Isai.</HI> 29.13. <HI>This people draw near me with their mouth, and with their lips do honour me, but have re|moved their heart far from me.</HI> The body near but the soul a great way off, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 33.31. <HI>They come unto thee as the people cometh, and they sit before thee as my people, and they hear thy words but they will not do them; for with their mouth they shew much love, but their heart goeth after their covetousness.</HI></P>
<P>They behave themselves handsomly, with a visible de|mureness as to the outward man, in hearing the word, but their hearts in the mean time are in and with the world. And yet 'tis certain, That duty one or another, however formal and specious as to the out-side ceremony of them, without the heart, are but a shadow without any substance, a shell without any kernel; empty things that want something within to fill them, dead works, the carcass of duty wihout a soul: And then we must worship in his fear, Psal. 5.7. <HI>But as for me, I will come into thy house in the multitude of thy mercy; and in thy fear will I worship towards thy holy Temple</HI>&mdash;As the consi|deration of his infinite mercy should set faith on work, so the remembrance of his glorious holiness should make us fear in all our approaches to him. Indeed the fear of God is so essential to, or in his worship, that it is sund|ry times put for it, as you may see by comparing, <HI>Deut.</HI> 6.13. with <HI>Mat.</HI> 4.10 and <HI>Isa.</HI> 29.13. with <HI>Mat.</HI> 15.9. <HI>We cannot serve God acceptably, unless we do it with rever|ence and godly fear, Heb.</HI> 12.28, 9.&mdash;You see that there are two ways for a people to be with God: To be with

him in their hearts, by a fixed adherence to him, in faith, love and fear; and to be with him in their lives, by a faithful attendance of his will in general, and his worship in particular,</P>
<P>Quest. 2 <HI>The next enquiry is, What it is for God to be with a people? or how he is with them that are with him.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> There are several ways of Gods being with men. As there is his essential presence, whereby he is equally in distant from all persons and places: Such is the immensity of his glorious being, that he is no where included or excluded&mdash; 1 Kings 8.27. <HI>Behold the heaven, and the heaven of heavens cannot contain thee,</HI> Jer. 23.24. <HI>do not I fill heaven and earth,</HI> (saith the Lord. (Again, there is his general providential presence, in way of pow|erful efficiency, preserving and governing what he hath made, to the attainment of his own ends. And thus he is not far from every one of us; <HI>For in him we live and move and have our being: Acts</HI> 17.27. In those respects, no man is or can be without God; for so he is not only with Saints and Angels in Heaven, and with men (<HI>godly and wicked</HI>) on earth, but with the devils and damned too, <HI>Psal.</HI> 139.7&mdash;10. <HI>Whither shall I flee from thy presence? If I ascend up into Heaven thou art there; If I make my bed in Hell, behold thou art there.</HI>&mdash;But the thing here intended is his being with men in a way of fa|vour and good will: his gracious presence, as it is com|monly called, looking after and manifesting his care of and kindness to them, wherein you may distinctly mind, two or three things.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="000421_0019_0FA5AA0FD91A3948">First, <HI>There is the protecting presence of God, whereby he defends his people against evil: whether it be</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P N="1">1. By saving them from trouble, preventing it when and how he will, Acts 18.10. <HI>For I am with thee, and no man shall set on thee to hurt thee</HI>; either they should not desire it (As Exod. 34.24. <HI>Neither shall any man de|sire thy Land, when thou shalt go up to appear before the Lord thy God, thrice in the year.</HI> God can bind the lusts of men, their pride, malice and covetousness; he sets what limits he will to their workings) or at least they should not do it. <HI>No man shall set upon thee to hurt thee</HI>: You know what was said to the <HI>Philadelphian</HI> Church, Rev. 3.10. <HI>I also will keep thee from the hour of Tempta|tion</HI> &mdash;When an hour of temptation goes far and wide, carrys a great breadth with it (As <HI>Trajans</HI> Persecution, which sundry take to be there intended, generally reach|ed to all the parts of the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire, that upon the account of his largeness, is called all the world, as also it is, Luke 2.1.) yet the Lord can shelter whom he pleaseth from sharing in it; Or,</P>
<P N="2">2 By saving them in trouble. That is a way that he oftentimes takes to secure his people: They suffer, and yet nevertheless safe, Job. 5.19. Psal. 91.9, 10. <HI>Because thou hast made the most high thy habitation, there shall no evil befall thee, neither shall any plague come nigh the dwelling:</HI> In midst of evils, and yet meet with no evil; none <HI>i e.</HI> that shall be eventually hazardous to their main interest: The presence of the chiefest good keeps

real evil at distance: He that dwells in God, or makes the most High his habitation, is out of reach of ruining danger. The Scripture abounds in the discovery of Gods being with his people in this way, <HI>Isai.</HI> 41.10. and 43.2&punc; <HI>When thou passest through the waters, I will be with thee, and through the Rivers they shall not overflow thee; when thou walkest through <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> fire, thou shalt not be burnt, nei|ther shall the flame kindle upon thee; neither floods shall drown, nor flames hurt them</HI>: Psal. 32.6. There may be waters, great waters, and floods of them, and the godly man (of whom he there speaks) in them too, and yet surely they shall nor come nigh him, to his damage or undoing; He may be soaked, but shall not sink or mis|carry there: Of like meaning is the great sight <HI>Moses</HI> met with, <HI>Exod.</HI> 3.2.3.

The soaking of the vessels of mercy in the waters of afflicti|on, help to widen and fit them for greater measures of that pure river of water of life, clear as Christal, pro|ceeding out of the Throne of God, and of the Lamb, <HI>Rev.</HI> 22.1.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>By saving them out of trouble,</HI> This is added, <HI>Psal.</HI> 37.39, 40. <HI>The salvation of the righteous is of the Lord:</HI> He is their strength in time of trouble; and the Lord
<PB N="16" REF="000421_0021_0FA5AA116FF44E60">
shall help them and deliver them: he shall deliver them from the wicked and save them, because they trust in him. Such a promise was given the Prophet for his eneourage|ment in his work, <HI>Jer.</HI> 1.19. <HI>They shall fight against thee, but they shall not prevail against thee, for I am with thee saith the Lord to deliver thee: When they have done what they can I will deliver thee:</HI> And so more generally <HI>Jer.</HI> 29.11. <HI>I know the thoughts that I think towards you,</HI> saith the Lord, <HI>thoughts of peace and not of evil, to givc you an expected end.</HI> Though others know not his thoughts towards them, <HI>Mi<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">h.</HI> 4.11, 12.

<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> There is the providing providence of God, whereby he suits his people in their wants: He knows what they need, and sends them a supply, <HI>Phil.</HI> 4.19. in temporal, and especially in spiritual respects, <HI>Psal.</HI> 34.10. nothing indeed good for them, or conducing to the furthe|rance of their internal and so eternal welfare shall be with|held, <HI>Psal:</HI> 85:11.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> There is his prospering blessing presence; succeeding them in their works, <HI>Gen.</HI> 24:3, 23. <HI>The Lord

was with</HI> Joseph, <HI>and made all that he did to prosper.</HI> To have God with us, is the way to have all go well; His favourable presence, brings outward prosperity, in what measure he sees meet. And succeeding them in his work, that I mean that more nearly concerns them in relation to him, upon a soul-account, <HI>Mat.</HI> 28.20. <HI>Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you; And lo, I am with you alway, even to the end of the World.</HI> As with Ministers in teaching, so with Churches also in at|tending what he requires; to keep his work going, or lift it forward in their hearts and hands.</P>
<P><HI>Quest.</HI> The last enquiry mentioned, is, <HI>Whence or on what account will the Lord be with a people that are with him</HI>?</P>
<P>The Answer may be given in a word, either way;</P>
<P N="1">1. Negatively, 'Tis not from any merit there is in them, or any thing they do. There's no such thing in|deed: <HI>Jacob</HI> said it, <HI>Gen.</HI> 32.10. <HI>I am not worthy the least of all thy mercies.</HI> Plain <HI>Jacob</HI> did not complement, but spake his heart in it, He saw and felt what he said, <HI>That though he wanted many things, yet not worthy of any thing.</HI> The great-Faith'd Centurion said it, <HI>Luk.</HI> 7.6. <HI>I am not worthy that thou shouldest come under my roof:</HI> The Elders of the <HI>Jews</HI> gave a high account of him, <HI>ver.</HI> 4, 5. say|ing, <HI>that he was worthy for vvhom he should do this,</HI> in that he loveth our Nation.&mdash;As if what he had done for them, deserved what they desired of him: But he was of another mind himself, <HI>I am not Worthy</HI>&mdash;Our Sa|viour teacheth all his followers to say it, <HI>Luk.</HI> 17.10.
<PB N="18" REF="000421_0023_0FA5AA12C14DC938">
<HI>When you have done all those things that are commanded you, say, vve are unprofitable servants</HI>; we have done that which was our duty to do: we owe him utmost obedi|ence, and so he can't be debtor to us for any thing we do, to whom all we do is due debt.</P>
<P N="2">2. Affirmatively; <HI>It is from his ovvn free Mercy.</HI> As 'tis his Grace that inables men to be with him; where there is any thing that way indeed, they are beholding to him for what they have and do in it, <HI>Joh.</HI> 15.5. So 'tis Grace also that ingages him to be with them: Remark|able is that passage to this purpose, <HI>Psal.</HI> 44.17, 8, 9. <HI>All this is come upon us, yet have we not forgotten thee, neither have we dealt falsly in thy Covenant:</HI> our heart is not turn|ed back, neither have our steps declined from thy way; though thou hast sore broken us in the place of Dragons, It follows, <HI>ver.</HI> 26. <HI>Arise for our help, and redeem us for thy mercies sake:</HI> They do not lean upon, or plead any merit in what they have done, but look to, and implore his mercy in what they still need to be done. <HI>Redeem us for thy mercies sake.</HI></P>

Hence see that the wicked are back friends to the places wherein, or people among whom they live; and that because they help to drive God from them, which is the worst and most baneful work they can be busied in: <HI>One sinner destroyes much good; One</HI> Achan (as the case may be) <HI>is enough to trouble a whole Camp.</HI> It is a solemn awful word you have, <HI>Prov.</HI> 15.29. <HI>The Lord is far from the wicked</HI>: For God and his Salvation go together.

<P N="2">2. Hence see the rise and reason of the <HI>Lords</HI> depar|ture from a people, and so whether to refer his absenting from us, one way or other: <HI>Gideon</HI> put the question to the Angel of the <HI>Lord,</HI> that appeared to him, Judges 6.12, 3. <HI>If the Lord be with us&punc; why then is all this befallen us: And where are all his wonders which our fathers told us of?</HI> may it not be said in our case, <HI>If the Lord be with us, as formerly, why have these things befallen us, what mean such and such testimonies of his anger?</HI> Assuredly we cant justly fault him on any account, <HI>who is righteous in all his ways, and holy in all his works</HI>: The departure does not begin on his hand; if you forsake him, he will forsake you; and not else: The blame belongs to and must be laid upon our sins, and our selves for them, Jer 2.17. <HI>hast thou not procured this to thy self, in that thou hast for|saken the Lord thy God, when he led thee by the way,</HI> and <HI>chap.</HI> 4.18.&mdash;'tis sin pushes God from a people, that he cannot keep them company as he is ready to do for us: forces him as it were to fall out with them, <HI>Jer.</HI> 44.22.

<P N="3">3. <HI>Hence see the right way for a people to keep or recover the presence of God:</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. To keep his presence: would you indeed have it continued? do you desire his abode with you in a way of good will? the text tells you how it is to be attained, <HI>The Lord is with you, while you are with him.</HI> Be it never so long, do not leave him, and he will not leave you: Wherein we have experience to confirm us: our fathers have found him very near to releive them in their need, Psal. 22.4, 5. How solemn and signal were the expres|sions of his kindness to them: many a deliverance was sent them, wrapt up in return of prayer.&mdash;</P>
<P>But 2. Which comes (it may be) nearer to our case, here is the right way before us to recover the presence of God, when, so far as it is lost, <HI>Zech.</HI> 1.3. <HI>Thus saith the Lord of Hosts, return to me saith the Lord of Hosts&punc;
<PB N="22" REF="000421_0027_0FA5B4CB1A2C9F60">
and I will return to to you, saith the</HI> Lord <HI>of Hosts.</HI> Could we make work on't in getting back again to him, he would then (through grace) meet us more than half the way. Let me speak freely herein, it is sensibly cer|tain, we have got nothing by wandring, and therefore it is time to give it over: I may confidently assert in the audience of this Assembly, That scarce (if ever) people had more cause or call to make that conclusion than we, Hos. 2.7. <HI>I will go and return to my first Husband, for then it was better with me than now.</HI> That is the mean|ing of the thorn-hedge, and high wall that hath been made in our way, to perswade and even necessitate us to such a resolve? Shall I say, it was better every where in Family, Church, Town and Colony; and better eve|ry way, we had better peace and plenty, better health and harvests, in former than later years; it was better for soul and body, better in spirituals, less Sin; and bet|ter in temporals, less sorrow: Oh that <HI>New-England might</HI> yet say it in good earnest, and do accordingly: <HI>I will return to my first Husband, for then it was better with are than now</HI>: The recovery of first love and first works, would be our glory: let me bespeak it in those words, Hos 6.1. <HI>Come let us return unto the Lord, for he hath torn, and he will heal us; he hath smitten, and he will bind us up.</HI> Were such a mutual excitation well pressed and warmed upon our own and one anothers hearts, to an awakening real and practical attendance of it, it would be a precious salve for our sore. This is the way to re|cover the presence of God, to return to him, and there|fore turn from all sin, Ezek. 18.30. The tearms are fair and just: Only be sure you are real and through in

to the lame, I was a Father to the poor.</HI> The meaning of those metaphors (saith Mr. <HI>Caryl</HI>) is that his care to defend them in their just cause, was extensive and effe|ctual: And then to quell wrong doers; wherein they need a quick and watchful eye, to find out sin in its co|verts (<HI>verse</HI> 16. <HI>The ways which I knew not, I searched out</HI>) and a steady weighty hand, to follow sin home, according to its desert: <HI>verse</HI> 17: <HI>I brake the jaws of the wicked, and pluckt the spoil out of his teeth.</HI>&mdash;'tis said of secure&punc; <HI>Laish, Judges</HI> 18.7. <HI>There was no Magi|strate (no master or heir of restraint) in the land, that might put them to shame in any thing.</HI> The lusts of men will easily run wild, if there be no restraint laid upon them: Some men (and not a few neither) will without fail do shamefully, if there be none to put them to shame for what is done. They that have not conscience enough, must have somwhat else to curb them:&mdash; This is the design and duty of Rulers, Rom. 13.3, 4. <HI>The sword of civil power is put into their hand by divine ap|pointment, as to reward them that do well, so to wound evil doers</HI>; not to strike with it at a venture whoever comes in their way, much less to turn the edge towards the innocent.

<PB N="28" REF="000421_0033_0FA5B4D16053C1C0">
and the fatal mischief that so commonly falls upon it, If there be any that need and conscientiously desire a resolution in this case, <HI>viz. whether selling strong drink to the heathen, as things are circumstanced, be sinful, or moral evil, and as such to be avoided?</HI> I will turn aside so far as to tender two words that way:</P>
<P N="1">1.&mdash;It is against the law of God; which by common consent of Divines, commands not only to avoid the gross acting of this or that evil, but temptations to and incentive of sin in our selves or others: It is a good general rule that is given for the right understanding of the Commandments; That where any sin is forbidden all the degrees, causes, means, occasions, and appearances of it are forbidden also. Let it be seriously pondred, and conscience sadly questioned upon it in the case mentio|ned; <HI>Is this to abstain from all appearance of evil</HI>? 1 <HI>Thes</HI> 5.22. yea, is it not a direct means to further the com|mission of sin? <HI>what less is done by this practice, then to put the bottle to them, and make them drunken also,</HI> as the expression is, <HI>Hab&punc;</HI> 2.15. Is it an innocent thing now a|days, to deliver a sword into a mad mans hand, suppose he proffer mony for it; <HI>or is it no sin to lay a stumbling block in the way of the blind? Rom.</HI> 14.13. <HI>That no man put a stumbling block or an occasion to fall in anothers way.</HI> Those two words (<HI>as is observed</HI>) intend such offen|ces, whereby others are either grieved or incouraged to sin: <HI>By this course are not the people of God grieved, and the heathen hardned in their wickedness, and so helped to hell?</HI> Again, <HI>by such things is not great occasion given to the enemies of the Lord to blaspheme?</HI> do, or will they
<PB N="29" REF="000421_0034_0FA5B4D3C42ED0E8">
not learn to say, their Religion is no better than ours, they will do any thing for a little money:</P>
<P>And again, Is there not Covetousness in feeding their Lusts for filthy lucres sake, and unrighteousness in wringing that little they have out of their hands, by ex|cessive and so dishonest gain:&mdash; In a word, Those that inable the Natives, to sin against God (which in this way they would not do, without the sellers assistance) are they not accessary in his account, of all the Drunkenness and Murders that by this means abounds among them.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>It is against the Law of Man</HI>; and that also adds to the evil of it: it is a violation of a just and good Law, made on purpose to prevent sin against God, and provo|cation to the eyes of his glory by it.</P>
<P>But to return; I am bold to say, That this evil among many others may, yea must be effectually declared a|gainst, <HI>lest the Land be defiled with blood,</HI> and so pity to some particulars, prove cruelty to the publick.&mdash; The Lord grant our Leaders may never cause us to erre one way or other; or bring more wrath upon <HI>Israel,</HI> so much as by a connivance at that which is openly and appa|rently evil. That downright daring wickedness may not walk the streets among us (as it does too common|ly in some places) for want either of wholsome Laws&punc; or home execution of them: I only add here, what they sometimes said, in the case then before them, <HI>Ezra</HI> 10.4. <HI>Arise, for this matter belongs to thee, we also will be with thee; be of good courage and do it.</HI> May I not say in the

name of all the tremblers at the words of the God of <HI>Israel</HI> among us (saving at least some particular mistakes and temptations) This matter (much honoured) be|longs to you, <HI>we also will be with you</HI>; Be of good cou|rage and do it: however, should men fail never so much feare not but God will stand by you in his work, 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 19.6, 7. And <HI>Jehosaphat</HI> said to the Judges, <HI>Take heed what you do, for ye judge not for man but for the Lord, who is with you in the judgment:</HI> wherefore now let the fear of the Lord be upon you, take heed and do it; for there is <HI>no iniquity with the Lord our God, nor respect of persons, nor taking of gifts:</HI> It follows, <HI>ver.</HI> 11. <HI>Deal cou|ragiously, and the Lord shall be with the good.</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>Secondly, <HI>Ministers</HI>; My Brethren, and my Fathers, give me leave to say, <HI>Let us be with God and he will be with us:</HI> The Lord hath made us Watchmen, to watch for souls, as those that must give account. And therein our work is, to receive the word at his mouth, and give warning from him, to deliver his mind and message plain|ly, <HI>Jer.</HI> 23.28. <HI>He that hath my word, let him speak my word faithfully: What is the chaffe to the wheat</HI> saith the Lord. To awaken men from sin, and warn them to a Saviour, by both Doctrine and Conversation, to lead in the way to heaven: The Lord give wisdom to win Souls; so assist and succeed in his work, that his word may run and be glorified; and, if it be his holy will, pre|vent the coming of such a woful day, that from the pro|phets of this <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> prophaness should go forth in the Land, or that word be made good against us, <HI>Michah</HI> 2.11 if a man walking in the spirit of falshood do lye, saying, <HI>I

will prophesie to thee of wine and strong drink,</HI> he shall even; be the prophet of this people.</P>
<P>Thirdly, <HI>The Lords People,</HI> the bulk or body of them I may say here also, <HI>Be you with God and he will be with you</HI>:&mdash;Take heed of forsaking him; you have seen and felt some of the sad effects of it, See <HI>Isai.</HI> 9.12, 13. <HI>For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand stret|ched out still, for the people turneth not to him that smiteth them:</HI> if we want more woe, that is a sure way to find it: it is not so much what some particular persons do (the Lord alwayes hath a mourning remnant) but how the generality of a people demean themselves towards him: Oh look to your work, and labour to do it well, and that is duty to God and man.</P>
<P N="1">1<HI>st</HI> Duty towards God, 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 12.24. Only <HI>Fear the Lord and serve him in truth with all your hearts.</HI>&mdash;Cer|tainly, however common such a course is among men, it is contempt that cannot long be born with, to set the World above God, to say (though never so secretly) of his service, what a weariness is it? <HI>When shall the new moon be gone that we may sell Corn, and the Sabbath that we may set forth Wheat,</HI> Amos 8.5.

name to live without the thing: can it be a little matter to make light of the great motion of the Gospel (forgive|ness and salvation, grace and glory therein tendered upon fairest, freest terms) and go one to his Farm, and the o|ther to his Merchandize, <HI>Mat.</HI> 22:5. <HI>How shall we escape, Heb.</HI> 2 3. What more provoking vileness can there be, than for lost, ruined, wretched sinners, to cast a Redeemer his riches &amp; righteousness at their heels, with all the love and bowels held forth by him. To refuse the shelter of his wings, and shake off his Government, not to be won by his wooings, nor welcom him with all his Treasures, while many a trifle in mean time, finds entertainment: Think of it sadly a thousand times, will it not be bitter|ness in the latter end, to prefer other things before the kingdom, to mind the body more than the soul, earth more than heaven, a moment more than eternity? what account can be given, or apoligy made for mens beha|viour herein? to love pleasures more than God, 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 3, 4. <HI>Creatures more than Christ,</HI> Mat. 10.37.

laid wast, <HI>Isai.</HI> 5.&mdash;It is mentioned as the Standard Rule of righteousness to render to all their dues, <HI>Rom.</HI> 13:7: <HI>As to God the things that are Gods</HI> (his fear and honour and obedience) <HI>so to man the things that are mans: (Owe no man any thing but to love one another,</HI> ver: 8:) And a|mong the rest to Superiors in particular, what by divine law belongs to them.</P>

<P>That which now remains, is to mention two words of general advice, about the matter before us, <HI>viz. To fasten the necessity that so it must be, and then follow the suit that so it may be.</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P N="1">1. Fasten the necessity that so it must be. It were well
<PB N="35" REF="000421_0040_0FA5B4D8AB7945C0">
if we could believe it in earnest, or feel the weight that lies upon us herein.&mdash;And that is,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>We must have God with us</HI>: For</P>
<P N="1">1<HI>st. Our condition is exceeding woful if he withdraw from us.</HI> Nothing more fatal can befal a people, than for God to forsake them, <HI>Jer.</HI> 23.33. <HI>What burden? I will even forsake you saith the Lord,</HI> that is a burden heavy enough, to sink men into all manner of misery, <HI>Hos.</HI> 9.12 <HI>Yea, woe also to them, when I depart from them:</HI> 'tis as it were all woes gathered into one.</P>
<P>The worst condition in the world with God, is better than the best that can be without him: Exod. 33.15. <HI>If thy presence go not, carry us not up hence: They were then in the wilderness, a land of deserts and pits, of drought and of the shadow of death; and they were going to</HI> Canaan <HI>a plentiful Country, the glory of all lands, (Ezek.</HI> 20.6.) you see what <HI>Moses</HI> said upon it, <HI>If thy presence go not</HI>&mdash; A waft howling wilderness with God, better than a land flowing with milk and honey without him: yea, earth with him, is better than Heaven without him. Alas, if our rock sell us, we are ruined: All is lost if God leave us:&mdash;onely (as you have sometimes heard from ano|ther, better hand) let it be remembred, That as a peo|ples forsaking God is not wont to be all at once, but by sundry steps they go away: though sometimes fearful haste is made in it.&mdash;Judg. 2.17. <HI>They turned quickly out of the way which their fathers walked in, obeying the Com|mandments of the Lord: but they did not so.</HI> Look into families and other societies, is there not too visible and

general a declension; are we not turned (and that quick|ly too) out of the way wherein our fathers walked? we have a form of godliness, but how far from that life and power of it, that was found with them: profession we make, but practical religion and righteousness, how low doth it run with very many. Is not our wine at least mingled with water.&mdash;But I say, as the common course is, for a people gradually to slide and steal off from God, until (if infinite grace step not in, to bring them to a stand) they are gone far away, it may be to an irre|moveable distance; so likewise his departure from a peo|ple is by several, (and sometimes more secret, undiscear|ned degrees; there are many removes made of the glo|ry; and by that means he may be gone a great way, before they are aware.&mdash;</P>
<P N="2">2. Our welfare is wrapt up in his being with us, <HI>Rom.</HI> 8.21. <HI>If God be for us, who can be against us?</HI> sometimes there are many against them that God is for, and yet al|ways there are more with, then against them; for him|self alone is more than all: As there is no wisdom against the <HI>Lord, Prov.</HI> 21.30. <HI>For the foolishness of God is wiser than men</HI>; so there is no power against the <HI>Lord, for the weakness of God is stronger than men</HI>: 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 14.6 There is no restraint to the <HI>Lord</HI> to save by many, or by few, 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 14.11. let a people be never so few and fee|ble, and their enemies never so many and mighty, <HI>If God be with them, all will be well, Zech.</HI> 12.3. Thus we must have God with us:</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="37" REF="000421_0042_0FA5B4DF0DDA5360">2. To that end, we must be with him; <HI>Ezra.</HI> 10.12. As thou hast said, so must we do: absolute necessity lyes, upon it: we must trust in and obey him, we must fear and follow him, we must depart from evil and do good we must fall in with his will, and walk in his ways: And then, <HI>Prov.</HI> 16.7. when a person, and so a peoples ways, please the Lord, he maketh even their enemies to <HI>be at peace with them He will change their hearts, or chain their hands, or some way work that they shall do them no real damage.</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P N="2">2. Follow the sute, that so it may be both ways: 1. That we may be with God, or that he would power|fully perswade us from our wandrings; heart and life distances from him; that is a prayer that is very proper in our case, Lamen. 5.21. <HI>Turn thou us to thee, O Lord, and we shall be turned: renew our days as of old.</HI>&mdash; However hard the work is, impossible to men and means, if thou wilt undertake it, it shall be done. The Prophet mentioned it among his acknowledgments, <HI>Dan.</HI> 9.12. <HI>All this evil is come upon us, yet made we not our prayer before the Lord our God, that we might turn from our iniquities.</HI>&mdash;They had their praying times in the cap|tivity; the fast of the fifth and seventh month, but they did not lay weight enough (<HI>at least the generality of them</HI>) upon that of converting grace to be granted them.
