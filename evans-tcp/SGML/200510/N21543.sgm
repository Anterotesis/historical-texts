<HEAD>Information for Immigrants to the New-England States.</HEAD>
<P>SINCE the commencement of the present unhappy war among the European nations, great numbers of people from France, Great-Britain, and their West-India islands, impelled by necessity, or prompted by a desire to avoid im|pending evils, have taken refuge in the United States. The principles of religion and humanity require the friendly attention of Americans to these strangers, many of whom arrive in circumstances of such wretchedness as to give pain to every feeling mind. It was in consequence of seeing among us, many immigrants of this description, to whom a little friendly advice and assistance would be acceptable, and useful, that a number of gentlemen in Boston, and its vicin|ity, associated at the close of the year 1793, under the name of "The Massachusetts Society for the aid of immigrants." Since the formation of this society, others have been insti|tuted on similar principles in New-York, Philadelphia, and Charleston, (S. C.); at which places most of the immi|grants arrive.</P>
<P>Not with design to <HI>encourage</HI> immigration, was our society formed; for, in our opinion, the happiness of our country depends not on any <HI>forced</HI> increase of its population, its <HI>nat|ural</HI> increase being sufficiently rapid, and more conducive to <HI>uniformity</HI> in principles, habits, and manners, the basis of political and social order and happiness; but solely with a view to afford comfort and relief to such as voluntarily, and from real or supposed necessity, seek an asylum among us, to take such by the hand and direct them in the way to be useful to themselves, and to that country which protects and befriends them.</P>
<P>To promote the design of their institution, in the circula|tion of information, useful to foreigners, the society have thought proper to publish short answers to the following queries, proposed to them by an intelligent literary immi|grant, and which appear to embrace most of the objects concerning which information is desired.</P>
<P><HI>Quest.</HI> 1. Would it not be more advisable for farmers from Great-Britain, or other European countries, where agriculture has been carried to a high pitch of perfection, to settle in the <HI>cultivated,</HI> rather than in the <HI>uncultivated</HI> parts of America?</P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> Farmers from Europe will very probably find the <HI>cultivated</HI> parts of the United States more pleasant, and probably more agreeable to their views: For although the uncultivated parts offer the fairest prospect of laying the foundation for an estate for their posterity, yet in an unsub|dued wilderness their business will be altogether new. The Americans are undoubtedly better calculated to subdue wild lands, than the English, who have been accustomed to a kind, mellow soil: So that though, with much spirit and enterprize, they may conquer many of the difficulties of set|tling a wild tract, yet, as their own knowledge will carry them most of the way, and a little information the rest, in manag|ing improved farms, where they have considerable capital, preference is to be given to the latter.</P>
<P><HI>Quest.</HI> 2. Are the difficulties of cultivating new land of long duration? Would they not be almost insurmountable to an English farmer, who has always lived on land in a pretty high state of cultivation?</P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> The difficulties will be great, and of several years duration, to the English farmer, who will find every thing in the business a perfect contrast to the ease of cultivation in his own country, and have to encounter much hardship and toil; whilst, however, the progressive improvement of his situation, and that of his neighbours, will from the first be a source of pleasure to him. In many parts, it has been found that the first settler of new lands clears it of the wood under the shelter of a hut only; and after a short and im|perfect cultivation of it, unable to pay for the soil, or in|fluenced by a roving disposition, leaves it to a successor, who builds a small house and barn, and brings to the soil; and he is often followed by a third occupier, purchasing his im|provements, who brings the farm to a high state of cultiva|tion. Yet this rotation cannot be said to be general in the New-England states, and seldom takes place but in case of the extreme poverty and rudeness of the first settler. The American farmer, who removes from old towns to new, generally increases his property faster by removal than he otherwise could; and after a few years, gets into a comfort|able way of living. In some instances, English farmers have succeeded in the uncultivated parts; and where they have some property, need not be discouraged from making set|tlements in them.</P>
<P><HI>Quest.</HI> 3. Can aliens hold lands in their own names in New-England? If not, how can they purchase land with safety?</P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="page cropped" EXTENT="1 span"> their own names, by act of assembly: But five years resi|dence, by the last naturalization act, passed by Congress, are necessary to obtain citizenship.</P>
<P><HI>Quest.</HI> 4. Can many farms be purchased at a reasonable rate in New-England, and particularly in Connecticut and Massachusetts?</P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> By prudent management in the application, there is no doubt that many good farms may be purchased at rea|sonable rates. The price has been raised in consequence of the present war in Europe, which has increased the price of provisions; but when a peace takes place, farms will prob|ably revert to their former value.</P>
<P><HI>Quest.</HI> 5. Are Connecticut and Massachusetts over|stocked with inhabitants? Are the people obliged to migrate from those states? Is there not still room for farmers, who have been used to land in a higher state of cultivation than Connecticut and Massachusetts?</P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> They are not over-stocked with inhabitants. This is evident from observing in our towns, where the numbers increase, that individual affluence increases proportionally. The young people migrate, not from necessity, but in ex|pectation of getting larger estates. In consequence, partly, of this disposition to migrate, many excellent tracts may be purchased in old settled towns, which will suit good farm|ers, and be found capable of great improvement.</P>
<P><HI>Quest.</HI> 6. Is wheat blighted, or destroyed by the Hessian fly?</P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> It is a received opinion, that wheat is subject to blight within 30 or 40 miles from the sea; but in the inte|rior parts, no such complaint is made, and it is generally raised. The Hessian fly is almost unknown in New-Eng|land.</P>
<P><HI>Quest.</HI> 7. Is the land in Connecticut and Massachu|setts pretty good? Is it better adapted for grazing than grain?</P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> Probably as good as in any part of America, excepting new land. It is hilly and stony, and well watered. The western counties of Massachusetts, and the middle and east|ern parts of Connecticut, are esteemed very good. Many parts are equally fitted for grazing and grain; it is prefera|ble for the former to the southern states: Yet the average produce of all sorts of grain in New-England exceeds that of the southern states.</P>
<P><HI>Quest.</HI> 8. Can produce be easily conveyed to market?</P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> There are so many navigable rivers in the New-England states, that few situations are more than 50 miles distant from water conveyance; as may be seen by recurring to maps. Connecticut river, particularly, lies convenient to a great extent of the New-England states. By these and other rivers, by several canals now cutting; by the post roads, which are pretty good, though far inferior to those in England; and by the snow in winter, the conveyance of produce to market is rendered generally easy.</P>
<P><HI>Quest.</HI> 9. Do different sorts of fruit come to perfec|tion?</P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> All sorts of English fruit come to perfection in New-England, and some which do not commonly grow in England. Orchards are universal in this country, except in the eastern parts of Maine.</P>
<P><HI>Quest.</HI> 10. Are the eastern states as healthful as the mid|dle and southern states? the people as virtuous and well in|formed? education as good, cheap, and convenient?</P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> We are not subject, except from some local, tem|porary cause, to the fever and ague in New-England; though consumptions, and other diseases known in England, prevail. The inhabitants here are more robust, and live to a greater age, generally, than at the southward. It is well known that the body of the people are better informed, more in|dustrious and temperate; education better provided for, by schools, which are established, by law, in all the settled parts of New-England.</P>

<P><HI>Quest.</HI> 11. Does slavery exist in New-England?</P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> It does not exist in Massachusetts; and in the other New-England states, efficacious measures have been adopted for its certain, but gradual abolition.</P>
<P><HI>Quest.</HI> 12. What religious sects are there in New-Eng|land? What <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="page cropped" EXTENT="1 word"> is most <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="page cropped" EXTENT="1 word">?</P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="page cropped" EXTENT="1 paragraph"></P>
<P><HI>Quest.</HI> 13. Are the people inclined to persecute each other for religious or political opinions?</P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> A persecuting <HI>power</HI> is not known in America, but a persecuting <HI>spirit</HI> is not extinguished. Zeal for religious opinions sometimes, and for wild democracy in opposition to rational republicanism, often manifests itself by abusive and inflammatory writings and speeches only; for the laws ef|fectually restrain opposite sects and parties from injuring one another.</P>
<P><HI>Quest.</HI> 14. How are the Clergy and Schoolmasters sup|ported?</P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> Every town, consisting of 50 householders, is oblig|ed, by law, to maintain a Schoolmaster; whom they select and contract with voluntarily; and whose salary is paid either by annual assessments on the property of the inhabit|ants of the town or parish, or voluntary contributions. Pew rents, assessments of the property of the inhabitants of the parish, parsonages, monies at interest, and voluntary contributions, are the principal means of supporting the Clergy.</P>
<P><HI>Quest.</HI> 15. How are the poor maintained?</P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> Every town is obliged, by law, to support its poor inhabitants; which are not numerous. The paupers, who are not inhabitants of any particular town, are maintained by the state.</P>
<P><HI>Quest.</HI> 16. Are the people in general well affected to the federal government?</P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> They are in general; for they consider the national prosperity connected with it.</P>
<P><HI>Quest.</HI> 17. Is the expense of living moderate?</P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> Since the present European war, the price of living has been dear, having increased from 50 to 70 per cent. When the war is over, it will probably be much diminished.</P>
<P><HI>Quest.</HI> 18. Are the taxes moderate?</P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> Yes. The expenses of government are less, by much, in proportion to numbers and wealth, than in any nation on the old continent.</P>
<P><HI>Quest.</HI> 19. Are servants scarce, and wages high?</P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> Common labourers and servants of both sexes are much wanted. Women's wages, in the sea ports, are from 25 to 50 dollars per annum, and considerably less in the country. Men's wages are from 60 to 120 dollars per an|num, in the maritime towns; and somewhat less in the country.</P>
<P><HI>Quest.</HI> 20. Are mechanics scarce, and wages high?</P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> House-carpenters and masons are much wanted at present. Their common wages are from 80 to 125 cents per day; 100 cents being a dollar. Mechanics of sober character, and skilled in their trades, of almost every kind, may find employment, and wages equal to their support; but particularly sail-cloth weavers and flax-dressers, and workers in iron.</P>
<P><HI>Quest.</HI> 21. Can manufactures be as advantageously estab|lished in New-England as in the southern and middle states?</P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> Almost every attempt to establish manufactures in the southern states, has failed; whereas, in Massachusetts, several important manufactures have been brought to per|fection. Wood and water, those powerful and necessary agents in manufactures, are every where plenty; but the high price of labour is a great obstacle to the success of this branch of business.</P>
<P><HI>Quest.</HI> 22. Is the climate of Connecticut and Massachu|setts as temperate as that of the middle and southern states?</P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> Our winters are generally longer and colder, though the winter is often as severe in Pennsylvania as in the eastern states. Our summers are not so hot, and our hot days are succeeded by cool nights, which render them more tolerable. Sudden changes of temperature are probably more frequent here; but still our climate is more healthful.</P>
<P><HI>Quest.</HI> 23. Of what extraction are the people of New-England?</P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> They are very generally of English extraction, and resemble the English in their character, manners, and habits.</P>
