<HEAD>His Excellency, The Earl of BELLOMONTS SPEECH TO THE Honorable the COUNCIL and Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives, Conven'd in General A&s;&s;embly, at <HI>Boston,</HI> in His Maje&s;ties Province of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay in <HI>New-England,</HI> on <HI>Fryday</HI> the
<DATE>2<HI>d.</HI> of <HI>June</HI> 1699</DATE>.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Gentlemen,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Cannot but think the extraordinary kind Reception I have had among you, is a &s;ure pre&s;age of a perfect good Agreement, and Corre&s;pondence between you and me; to which no Care of mine or Study &s;hall be wanting. And that I may acquit my &s;elf towards you as I ought, I &s;hall as well as my Weak|ness will permit me, Copy after the Example of Our Great Ma&s;ter the King, who through the whole Cour&s;e of His Admini&s;tration, has &s;hew<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" EXTENT="1 letter">d a tenderne&s;s of His people not to be equall'd, and a &s;in|gular moderation even towards His mo&s;t Inveterate Enemies; the fir&s;t an effect of His Goodne&s;s, the latter of His Magnanimity and Clemen|cy: which admirable qualities have gain'd Him the ju&s;t Veneration of all mankind; and ought to po&s;&s;e&s;s our hearts that are here with the same Loyalty, Affection and Duty towards His Sacred Per&s;on, that our Fellow Subjects in <HI>England</HI> have manife&s;ted ever &s;ince His Maje|&s;ties mo&s;t Happy Acce&s;&s;ion to the Throne.</P>
<P>I cannot more truly Imitate the King in a Fatherly Care and Ten|derne&s;s of you, than by looking into the publick Admini&s;tration of Ju&s;tice, to &s;ee that it be done quickly and impartially. And for moderation, which I take to be in a peculiar manner the Kings At|tribute; I come among you with a Settled Re&s;olution not to di&s;turb any of you in the Exerci&s;e of your Con&s;ciences, or in the free En|joyment of your Liberties and E&s;tates.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="039343_0002_10141E4CD6BB2720">In a word, I will do you all the good I po&s;&s;ibly can in my Station; and that in Duty to God, to the King, and to my own Con&s;cience and Honour.</P>
<P>I Under&s;tand the Courts of Ju&s;tice are fallen, I therefore Recom|mend your Reviving them by Act of A&s;&s;embly, &s;uch an one I mean, as you can be &s;ure will meet with His Maje&s;ties Approbation when 'tis <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> before Him.</P>
<P>I &s;hould be glad you would think of ways to Ingage the Neigh|bour Indians in a Trade with you, which I am apt to believe may be managed with that advantage to them, by a good regulation and under&s;elling the <HI>French,</HI> that their friend&s;hip and fidelity may be &s;e|cured to the Crown, and then they will be no longer Thorns in your &s;ides.</P>
<P>The Country I am told is de&s;titute of Stores of War, which is &s;o nece&s;&s;ary a provi&s;ion, that I cannot think I need do more than put you in mind of it.</P>
<P>The Fortifications on the I&s;land at the mouth of your Harbour, ought in my mind to be looked into, I intend to vi&s;it them in a few days with <HI>His Maje&s;ties Engineer,</HI> and will afterwards report to you, whether the pre&s;ent Works be &s;ufficient, or new ones requi&s;ite.</P>
<P>I would very gladly promote a Charter of Incorporation for your Colledge at <HI>Cambridge,</HI> and will heartily joyn with you in addre&s;&s;ing His Maje&s;ty for His Royal Grant of &s;uch Priviledges and Franchi&s;es as His Maje&s;ty in His Goodne&s;s &s;hall Think fit. 'Tis a great advan|tage you have above the other Provinces, that your Youth are not put to Travel far for Learning, but have the Mu&s;es at their doors. Be&s;ides that Colledge will always be a Nur&s;ery to afford you a Sup|ply of Able Mini&s;ters for the Cure of Souls. Therefore 'twere pitty the Kings Royal Charter &s;hould not be &s;ollicited out of hand.</P>
<P>Mr. Speaker, and you Gentlemen Re|pre&s;entatives;</P>
<P>AS it is your undoubted right, that the Granting or Continuing a Revenue &s;hould have its fir&s;t ri&s;e with you: I therefore apply to you, that Care may be taken for the nece&s;&s;ary &s;upport of the Government, in &s;uch a manner as will be&s;t &s;uit with the ea&s;e and circum&s;tances of the People. The Revenue of Exci&s;e I under&s;tand will Expire the Twenty Ninth of this Month, and you will do well to con&s;ider, whether it will not be proper to revive it. Mr. Trea&s;u|rer has &s;hew'd me an Ab&s;tract of the publick Accounts, by which I perceive the Government is out of Debt, which is a happy Cir|cum&s;tance for you, and as &s;uch, is very plea&s;ing to me, for I &s;hall always delight in your happine&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="039343_0003_10141E4FB1874A70">Some <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> I am Commanded from <HI>England</HI> to offer you for your pa&s;&s;ing; which are of a publick nature, and will be for your Ser|vice; and &s;uch other Laws as you &s;tand in need of, for promoting your Trade, and the general Intere&s;t of the Province, I will Joyn with you in; provided they be made to &s;quare with the Laws of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;hould be wanting to you and my &s;elf too, if I did not put you in mind of the indi&s;pen&s;able duty and re&s;pect we owe the King, for being the Glorious In&s;trument of our Deliverance from the odious Fetters and Chains of Popery and Tyranny which had almo&s;t overwhelm'd our Con&s;ciences, and Subverted all our Civil Rights. There is &s;omething that's God-like in what the King has done for us. The work of Redemption and Pre&s;ervation comes next to that of Creation. I would not be mi&s;under&s;tood &s;o as to be thought to Rob God of the Glory of that Stupendous Act of His Providence, in bringing to pa&s;s the late happy and wonderful Revolution in <HI>England.</HI> His Ble&s;&s;ed Work it was without doubt, and He was pleas'd to make King <HI>William</HI> mediately the Author and In&s;trument of it. Ever &s;ince the Year 1602. <HI>England</HI> has had a Succe&s;&s;ion of Kings that have been Aliens; in this re&s;pect I mean, That they have not fought our Battles, nor been in our Intere&s;ts, but have been in an unnatural manner plotting and contriving to undermine and &s;ubvert our Religion, Laws and Liberties, till God was plea&s;ed by His Almighty Power, and Infinite Mercy and Goodne&s;s to give us a true <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> King in the Per&s;on of His Pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty, who has upon all occa&s;ions hazzarded His Royal Per&s;on in the Front of our Battles, and where there was mo&s;t danger. He has re&s;tor'd to our Nation the almo&s;t lo&s;t Character of Bravery and Valour; and what is mo&s;t valuable of all, His Maje&s;ty is entirely in the Intere&s;ts of His people 'Tis therefore our Duty and Intere&s;t to Pray to God in a mo&s;t fervent manner, That He would Ble&s;s our Great KING <HI>WILLIAM,</HI> with a long and pro&s;perous Reign over us, to which I am per&s;waded, you that are here pre&s;ent, and all Good Men will heartily &s;ay. <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
