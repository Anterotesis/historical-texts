<HEAD>The INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>GOOD News from Heaven, the day-&s;pring from on high hath vi&s;ited this undone world, after a Deluge of &s;in and mi&s;ery, behold the bow in the Cloud; the Lord God hath made and e&s;tabli&s;hed a new Covenant, and this is it that hath ca&s;t the fir&s;t beam on the dark &s;tate of lo&s;t and fallen man; and hath brought life and immortality to light. This Covenant is <HI>the hope of Sinners, The Riches of Saints, the</HI> Magna Charta <HI>of the City of God.</HI> The forfeited Lea&s;e of eternity renewed; Gods Deed of Gift, wherein he hath on fair conditions, granted <HI>Sinners</HI> their lives, &amp; &s;etled upon his <HI>Saints</HI> an everla&s;ting Inheritance.</P>
<P>Hear, O ye forlorn Captives; who have &s;old your &s;elves to eternal bondage, &s;poiled your &s;elves of all your glory, &s;ealed your &s;elves up under everla&s;ting mi&s;ery; you are dead in your &s;ins, guilty before God, under wrath, under a cur&s;e, bound over to eternal vengeance. But behold, there is yet hope in <HI>I&s;rael</HI> concerning this thing; the Lord God hath taken

compa&s;&s;ion upon you, hath opened a way for you to e&s;cape out of all this mi&s;ery &amp; bondage; Lift up the hands that hang down, comfort the trembling knees; An Ark, an Ark hath God prepared, in which is &s;alvation from the Flood; A Covenant, a new Co|venant hath he made and e&s;tabli&s;hed, which (if you lay hold on it) will recover all you have lo&s;t, ran|&s;ome you from death, redeem you from Hell, and advance you to a more &s;ure and ble&s;&s;ed condition, than your original &s;tate from which you have fallen. This is the hope of &s;inners; This is the Heritage of the &s;ervants of the Lord.</P>
<P>Glorious tydings, good news indeed! but what is this Covenant? or what is there that is given &amp; granted therein? Why, in &s;um, there's all that hea|ven &amp; earth can afford; all that can be needed or de&s;ired: and this by a firm and irrevokable Deed, made over, and made &s;ure to all that will &s;incerely embrace it.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. I. God in the Covenant.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1 THE Lord God hath made over <HI>him&s;elf</HI> in this Covenant. That's the great &amp; comprehen|&s;ive promi&s;e, <HI>Jer.</HI> 31.33. <HI>I will be their God.</HI> I am God, and what I am, 'tis all theirs: my &s;elf, my glo|rious incomprehen&s;ible E&s;&s;ence, all my glorious attri|butes, my omnipotence, my omni&s;cience, my wi&s;|dom, my righteou&s;ne&s;s, my holine&s;s, mine all-&s;uffi|ciency, my faithfulne&s;s, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> I will make over my &s;elf to them to be henceforth and for ever theirs:</P>
<P>Their Friend, their Portion, their Sun, their Shield.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Their Friend,</HI> I was angry, but mine anger is turned away: I was an adver&s;ary, I had a controver|&s;ie with them, but I am reconciled, I have found <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> ran&s;ome, the quarrel is compo&s;ed, my wrath is ap|pea&s;ed, I am friends with them; <HI>I will forgive their iniquities, and their &s;in will I remember no more; I will take away their iniquity and receive them graciou&s;ly; I will heal their back &s;liding, I will love them freely; for mine anger is turned away from them,</HI> Jer. 31.34. Ho&s;. 14.4. <HI>Glory be to God on high: on earth peace, good will towards men.</HI> Fury is not now in me: favour, and friend&s;hip, love, and good will, is all they may hence|forth expect from me. Sinners, what is there to be feared? what is there dreadful, but an angry provok|ed God? Thence is &s;orrow and angui&s;h, thence is famine, and pe&s;tilence, and &s;word; thence is death and hell: he doth not know what the wrath of God means, that doth not &s;ee in the bowels of it, all the

plagues above ground, and all the vengeance of eter|nal fire. Whatever terrors, or torments have &s;eized upon thee; upon thy body, upon thy &s;oul; whate|ver lo&s;&s;es, cro&s;&s;es, vexations, afflictions, plague thee on this earth; whatever honour, and angui&s;h, what|ever amazing, confounding torments are like to meet thee, and feed upon thee in the lake beneath, thou maye&s;t &s;ay of all this, <HI>This is the wrath of God.</HI> That day the Lord &s;ays to thee, <HI>Fury it not in me</HI>; he &s;aith al&s;o, <HI>Fear &s;hall be no more to thee.</HI> That hour the Lord &s;aith, I am thy friend, Dea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h and Hell vani&s;h. The day is broken, the &s;hadows fly away. And this is one thing included in that promi&s;e [<HI>I am their God</HI>] I am their friend.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Their Portion.</HI> Fury cea&s;e? Fears vani&s;h? Frind&s;hip, favour, life granted? But what &s;hall he have to live upon? Man was never intended to be a &s;elf &s;ufficient; he was created under a nece&s;&s;ity of dependance of &s;omething without him; not only for the continuation of his being, but of the com|fort of his being: he cannot live upon the air, though he hath &s;caped the fire: the &s;oul of man is too big for all the world; like <HI>Noah</HI>'s Dove, it can find no re&s;t below, and where &s;hall it find it, or on what &s;hall it &s;ub&s;i&s;t? Why God will not &s;tarve his friends; he that hath &s;aved their lives, will find them a live|lyhood; becau&s;e there is no other to be found, he him&s;elf will be a livelyhood to them; their portion, their maintenance, and their heritage for ever. As their deliverance is from him, &s;o their dependance &s;hall be on him; he is their &s;ub&s;tance, and on him

The Lord [Gives] portions to his enemies; not only the young Ravens, but the old Lions, and Tigers, the wor&s;t of men do &s;eek their meat from God, P&s;al. 17.14. they have their <HI>portion in this life, who&s;e bellies thou fillest with thy hid trea&s;ure</HI>: they have their portion: &s;ome of them have their portion in the <HI>City,</HI> others a portion in the <HI>Field</HI>: to &s;ome he gives a portion of <HI>gold,</HI> to others a por|tion of <HI>worldly glory,</HI> to others a portion of plea&s;ures; by all the&s;e he deals, as the father of the prodigal, he gives them their portion, and &s;ends them away. But whil&s;t he [gives] portions to the&s;e, he [is] the portion of his Saints, he makes over and &s;ettles him&s;elf upon them, as their inheritance for ever: they &s;hall never be in want whil&s;t there is in him to &s;upply them; they &s;hall never be in &s;traits whil&s;t there is in him to relieve them: all their wants be upon me.</P>

<P N="2">2. <HI>A new Law,</HI> or frame, or bent of &s;pirit; in|clining di&s;po&s;ing and fitting them to all that which they are made for.

<P N="1">1. <HI>The place of the end</HI> God is its fir&s;t and la&s;t. He's fir&s;t in the eye, and it looks no farther. It makes him not onely the chief, but in a &s;en&s;e its onely aim. It will have no other God, and therefore no other end, but the Lord. It makes all things el&s;e, not onely to &s;toop and &s;tand by, but to &s;erve to him <HI>Get you hence, &s;tand off,</HI> is its language to all that &s;tands up in his room, or &s;tands in his way. Evil men, whatever honour they pretend to have for the Lord, they do but make him a &s;ervant to their other gods. Religion they will take up, but it is onely to &s;erve their own turns, to bring about their carnal ends; <HI>they &s;erve not the Lord, but their own bellies,</HI> &s;aith the Apo&s;tle, <HI>Rom.</HI> 16.18. <HI>Phil.</HI> 3.19. Nay they make the Lord their fellow-&s;ervant. They &s;erve, and their Religion mu&s;t &s;erve their &s;en&s;ual appetites. He that will have &s;o much Religion only, as he may live up|on, (which is the mea&s;ure of the mo&s;t) makes the Lord no longer his God, but his &s;ervant A &s;incere Chri&s;tian will &s;et God upon the throne, and makes all things el&s;e his &s;er|vants or his foot &s;tool Whatever will not be &s;erviceable, mu&s;t be trodden in the dirt. Nothing will be loved, and embraced, but what will &s;et God higher or bring God near|er to his heart.</P>

As you know the Needle when it is touched with a Load&s;tone, then it turns after it. The Load&s;tone is not more natural at|tractive of the Needle, than God is of that heart which he hath touched.

<P N="1">1. The de&s;iring of the Soul after God. I&s;ai. 26.8, 9. <HI>The de&s;ire of our Soul is to thy Name.&mdash;With my &s;oul have I de&s;ired thee in the night, yea, with my &s;pirit within me will I &s;eek thee early.</HI> De&s;ire is the &s;oul in motion God wards.

de&s;ire. He de&s;ires pardon, he de&s;ires peace, he de&s;ires help, and the healing of his wounds; but all this is but one de&s;ire. God is all. <HI>One thing have I de&s;ired,</HI> P&s;al. 19 4</P>
<P N="2">2. The thir&s;ting of the &s;oul. P&s;al. 42.2. <HI>My &s;oul thir&s;teth for God, for the living God.</HI> Thir&s;ting is the extremity of de&s;ire; hunger and thir&s;t are the appetite of de&s;ire heightened; violent and painful appetites; <HI>My &s;oul thir&s;teth, and is in pain till it be &s;atisfied.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. The longing of the &s;oul. P&s;al. 63 1. <HI>O God, thou art my God early will I &s;eek thee: my fle&s;h longeth for thee in a dry and thir&s;ty land, where no water is.</HI> Longing cau&s;eth langui&s;hing, and abortions, if it be not &s;atisfied.

<P N="4">4 Calling after God, P&s;al. 4.1. <HI>Hear me [when I call] O God of my righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> Calling upon God, is the voice of de&s;ires. The de&s;iring &s;oul will not keep &s;ilence; the tongue, the eye, the ears the hands, the knees, mu&s;t all be Oratours, when the flame is once kindled within.</P>
<P N="5">5. Crying after the Lord. This is an expre&s;&s;ion an&s;wering the thir&s;ting of the &s;oul. Crying is a pa&s;&s;ionate, and importunate praying. <HI>I cryed unto the Lord with my whole heart,</HI> P&s;al. 119.145.</P>
<P N="6">6 Crying out after God. This is the manner of the longing &s;oul. Crying out, notes more than bare crying; loud cries, &s;trong cries, forced out by

<P N="7">7. Following hard after the Lord, P&s;al. 63.8 <HI>My &s;oul followeth hard after thee.</HI> This expre&s;&s;ion is more comprehen&s;ive, it notes, both all the work|ings, and breakings, and breathings of the &s;oul within, and its diligent pur&s;uing in the u&s;e of all outward means, and pre&s;&s;ing on after the Lord. All tho&s;e labourings, and watchings, and runnings, all that holy violence, wherewith a Saint pre&s;&s;es <HI>into the Kingdom of God.</HI></P>
<P>Put all this together, and you will &s;ee the pow|er and influence the Lord hath on holy Souls, to the drawing of them after him; they are in moti|on Heaven-ward; de&s;iring, thir&s;ting, longing, cal|ling, crying, crying out, following hard after him. What aileth the&s;e &s;ouls? what is the matter with them? what would they have? Judg. 19.23. <HI>What aileth thee,</HI> &s;aid the <HI>Danites</HI> once to <HI>Micah, that thou come&s;t thus after us? What aileth thee? Why, you have taken away my gods, and what have I more. What aileth the&s;e crying, longing, running Souls?</HI> Why, it is after their God they cry, it is after their God they run. 1 King. 19.20. <HI>Go back Eli&s;ha,</HI> &s;aid once the Prophet to him, when he had ca&s;t his Mantle on him: <HI>Go back, for what have I done unto thee? What ha&s;t thou done? enough to hold me from going back</HI>: there went vertue with the Mantle; the Mantle fell on his heart, as well as his back, and drew it

<P>God is the reward of his Saints, Gen&punc; 15.1. <HI>I am thy exceeding great reward,</HI> I&s;ai. 46 4. <HI>My judgment is with the Lord, and my reward with my God.</HI> God is the re|ward they [<HI>&s;hall</HI>] receive, and the reward they look to receive, Heb 11.29. <HI>Mo&s;es had [re&s;pect] to the recom|pence of reward.</HI></P>
<P>And therefore the Argument is weighty, which Chri&s;t u&s;ed to di&s;&s;wade his Di&s;ciples from being in their Devo|tions, in their Alms-deeds, as the Phari&s;ees and Hypo|crites are, who <HI>di&s;figured their countenances in their fa&s;ts, who &s;ounded a Trumpet to proclaim their Alms; Be ye not like them, for they have their reward.</HI> The Argument was &s;trong to the Di&s;ciples, who being men of another &s;pirit, could not be &s;atisfied with &s;uch a reward.</P>

<P>No wonder Chri&s;tians, that carnal hearts are &s;uch &s;trangers to the Word, can &s;o well &s;it out at Duties, &amp; can want Ordinances; Preaching and Praying, and Sabbaths, they can &s;pare, and not feel their want, what wonder?

The heart is then &s;avingly opened, when it freely &s;ets out its &s;elf upon God, all its &s;treams run in to the Lord; and when it takes in, and takes down God into the depth of the &s;oul. The heart thus opened to the Lord, when God is come in, will clo&s;e upon him. Abide with me; thou ha&s;t entred upon thine habitation, Oh let this be thy dwelling for ever. Only this mu&s;t be farther ad|ded, that with God it takes in all things of God; his Word, his Ordinances, his Wayes, and all his Di&s;pen&s;ations: With his Love, his Laws; with his comforts, his Coun&s;els; with his Coun&s;els, his Corrections; with thee, I accept of all that's thine; both thy yoke and thy cro&s;s, thy &s;elf, Lord, thy love Lord, and what thou wilt with thee.</P>

Love will make any thing down. When it puts &s;uch a &s;weetne&s;s into &s;in, that even death and hell will down with carnal hearts for its &s;ake, Oh what a fea&s;t will love make of holine&s;s and glory! get love to Chri&s;t, love to Religion, and you will never demand, <HI>Where is the ble&s;&s;edne&s;s?</HI> where is the &s;weetne&s;s?</P>
<P>Love will &s;weeten both the comforts and the exerci&s;es of Religion; 'twill make duties &s;weet; yea, and &s;ufferings &s;weet: there are two things that are naturally &s;weet to love,</P>
<P>To plea&s;e. To prai&s;e.</P>
<P N="1">1.

That the Lord God is a dreadful God. 2. That the Lord hath put the dread of him&s;elf upon the hearts of all the

earth. 3. That yet by &s;in the heart of man is much hardned from the fear of the Lord. 4. That God will recover his honour, and again put his fear into the hearts of his people. 5. What this fear of the Lord is that he will put into them.</P>
<P N="1">1. The Lord God is a dreadful God; he is dreadful in the Excellency and Glory of his Ma|je&s;ty, Job 13.11. <HI>Shall not his Excellency make you afraid, and his dread fall upon you?</HI> His Power is dreadful. <HI>Fear ye not me, &s;aith the Lord? Will ye not tremble at my pre&s;ence, which have placed the Sand for the bound of the Sea, by a perpetual Decree, that it cannot pa&s;s it; and though the Waves thereof to&s;s them&s;elves, yet they cannot prevail; though they roar, yet can they not pa&s;s over it.</HI> Fear ye not me, &s;aith the Lord? He that did this, what can he not do? His wrath is a dread, Jer. 10.10. <HI>At his wrath the earth &s;hall tremble, and the Nations &s;hall not be able to abide his Indignation.</HI> Yea, his Holi|ne&s;s, his Truth, his Righteou&s;ne&s;s, &amp; all his Name, Deut. 28.58. <HI>That thou may&s;t fear this glorious and fearful Name [the Lord thy God.</HI>] The Lord God is a dreadful God.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Lord God hath put the dread of him|&s;elf upon the hearts of all the earth. Not the be&s;t only, but the wor&s;t of the &s;ons of men. <HI>I am a great King, &s;aith the Lord, and my Name is dreadful among the Heathen.</HI> This dread of the Lord breaks forth upon them.</P>
<P N="1">1. From the <HI>impre&s;s of God</HI> upon the natures of all men. As the Law, &s;o the Being of God is
<PB N="181" REF="000857_0186_0FABB25B92C66D50">
written in their hearts, he hath his Witne&s;s in their Con&s;ciences. If the Athei&s;ts of the Earth could an&s;wer all the Arguments from without, proving that there is a God; yet they can never confute their own Con&s;ciences. If the works of God do not, their Reins &s;hall in&s;truct them; if they will not &s;ee, whether they will or no, they &s;hall feel that there is a God; and where-ever God is felt, he is feared; even when their mouth &s;peaketh proud things, their heart &s;hall meditate terror; and when nothing el&s;e is, they &s;hall be a terror to them&s;elves.</P>
<P N="2">2. It is encrea&s;ed by the <HI>great works of God,</HI> his wonders that he doth in the World; his Thun|der and his Hail, his Wind and his Waves; his Earth-quakes, make an Earth-quake in hearts.</P>
<P N="3">3. It's further heightned, by <HI>his Judgments</HI> which he executeth on the Earth. The Judg|ments of God, are God revealing him&s;elf from Heaven, again&s;t the ungodline&s;s and unrighteou&s;|ne&s;s of men, and do then &s;trike mo&s;t terror, 1. When he &s;mites <HI>&s;uddenly,</HI> and makes quick work with &s;inners: as when <HI>Herod</HI> was &s;mote by an Angel of God, <HI>Nadab</HI> and <HI>Ab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hu</HI> con&s;umed by fire from God, immediately upon their Sin. Sud|den &s;trokes &s;hake &s;ecure hearts. 2. When he ex|ecutes <HI>strange</HI> Judgments, makes a new thing, as in the ca&s;e of <HI>Korah</HI> and his company, he made the Earth to open her mouth upon them, and &s;wallow them up; &s;o he made the flies and the frogs, and the lice, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to be the Executioners

of his wrath on <HI>Pharoah.</HI> 3. When he executes <HI>great wrath for little &s;ins,</HI> as men account them; as in the ca&s;e of <HI>Uzzah,</HI> whom he &s;truck dead for but touching the Ark when it &s;hook 4 When he exerci&s;es <HI>great &s;everity on his own,</HI> on tho&s;e that are near him. If he &s;pareth not his Sons, what will he do with his Enemies? <HI>If the&s;e things be done on the green Tree, what &s;hall be done on the dry?</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. Yet further, By their <HI>Con&s;cience of guilt,</HI> and their binding over to the Judgment to come. <HI>The &s;in of Judah is written with a Pen of Iron, with a point of a Diamond, it is graven upon the Tables of their heart.</HI> The &s;in of <HI>Judah</HI> is written; yea, &amp; the &s;in of the <HI>Gentiles</HI> al&s;o, <HI>Rom.</HI> 2.15. <HI>Their Con|&s;cience al&s;o bearing witne&s;s, and their thoughts the mean while accu&s;ing.</HI> And where their <HI>&s;in</HI> is written, there their <HI>Judgment</HI> is written, which even nature it &s;elf will teach, doth inevi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ably follow upon &s;in; and this is the great dread that is upon them. The very mention of Judgment to come, made a <HI>Fae|lix</HI> tremble at the face of a poor Pri&s;oner. This is the terror of the Lord, mentioned by the A|po&s;tle&punc; 2 Cor. 5.10, 11. <HI>We mu&s;t all appear before the Judgment-Seat. &mdash; Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord, we per&s;wade men.</HI> Death is &s;aid to be the <HI>King of terrors</HI>: and this is the terror of death, <HI>after that the Judgment.</HI> All the&s;e, the impre&s;s of God upon their hearts, the wonders of God in the world, the vengeance of God executed on &s;in, the &s;ence of guilt, and of a Judgment to come, do preach to the Con&s;ciences of &s;inners, that <HI>it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.</HI></P>
<P N="3"><PB N="183" REF="000857_0188_0FABB25EC032BC48">3. Yet by &s;in the hear<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of man is much <HI>hardned from the fear of the Lord.</HI> Sin blinds the eye, and hardens the heart, brings into danger, and puts out of fear.

The&s;e two, the ju&s;tifying and &s;anctifying of God, though they be much the &s;ame; yet there is &s;ome difference betwixt them: To &s;anctifie God, is to reve|rence him in our hearts, and to repre&s;ent him in the glo|ry of his Holine&s;s before men. To ju&s;tifie God, &s;uppo|&s;eth a &s;inful judging, and fooli&s;h charging of God in the hearts of men, and is our vindicating of him from &s;uch charges. Is God righteous? How is it then that he is &s;o partial in his dealings with the righteous and unrigh|teous? that he deals wor&s;e with tho&s;e that fear him, than with tho&s;e that fear him not? Is God good? How is it then that he is &s;o hard, not only in impo&s;ing, but inflict|ing &s;uch hard things upon his own? Is God true? How is it then that he fails his people &s;o often, when he hath &s;aid, I will never fail them nor for&s;ake them? Our fle&s;h hath failed, and our heart hath failed, yea, and our God

hath often failed us too; we have often called, and have had no an&s;wer; we have often tru&s;ted, and have had no deliverer. Yet God is righteous, yet God is good, yet God is true; he hath not been unrighteous, he hath not been an hard Ma&s;ter, he hath not failed nor for&s;aken; this is to ju&s;tifie God.</P>
<P>Our ju&s;tifying of God, hath &s;ome kinds of re&s;emblance with Gods ju&s;tifying of us. Gods ju&s;tification of us, &s;tands in his not imputing &s;in to us, and accepting us as righteous; and our ju&s;tifying of God, &s;tands in our not imputing evil to him, and our acknowledging him to be true, ju&s;t and good. God hath ju&s;tified me from my &s;ins, and that's enough to proclaim him good and faith|ful, whatever his other dealing<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> be: Let him afflict me, let him cha&s;tifie me, &s;ince he will not judge me, nor con|demn me with the world. God hath ju&s;tified him&s;elf in my Con&s;cience. I have found that the Lord is gracious, I have found that God is faithful; he hath &s;aid he will not, and I mu&s;t &s;ay he hath not for&s;aken: He hath not failed, when he hath mo&s;t failed me; when he hath been farthe&s;t off from my help, he hath even then been a pre|&s;ent help in trouble: He hath an&s;wered, when he hath been mo&s;t &s;ilent; he hath been mo&s;t good, when he hath been mo&s;t hard. I have never found more &s;weet, than in his bitter Cup. I mu&s;t judge my &s;elf, not my God: I have &s;inned, I have &s;inned again&s;t him, and therefore I mu&s;t ju&s;tifie him when he &s;peaketh, and clear him when he judgeth. Hold thy peace querulous heart, be &s;ilent all the earth before the Lord, for <HI>truly God is good to</HI> I&s;rael, <HI>and to them that are of a clean heart.</HI> There be few among the wor&s;t of <HI>&s;inners,</HI> but if Con&s;cience might be &s;uffered to &s;peak, it would ju&s;tifie God. 'Tis Lu&s;t that quarrels, not Con&s;cience; 'Tis vain to &s;erve the Lord, and what profit is there to keep his Ordinan|ces. His wayes are unequal and hard, his promi&s;e fails,

<P>Chri&s;tians know, that though God be tender of his Saints, yet he is jealous for his Name; he tenders them as the apple of his Eye, but not a|bove the lea&s;t tittle of his Honour.

Re&s;olution for holine&s;s, with|out an holy inclination, is a blade without a root; as fre&s;h and as green as it looks, 'twill wither and come to nothing; no Root, no Fruit, nor la&s;ting. The heart is the root of action, and grace is the life of the root: When our Re&s;olutions are the blade &s;prouting forth of this living Root, then they will abide and bring forth the Ear, and an Harve&s;t.</P>

The life of a Chri&s;tian is labori|ous; whil&s;t others are in their beds, he mu&s;t be on his knees; whil&s;t others take their plea&s;ure, he mu&s;t take pains; whil&s;t others take their times, now a little, and then a little, he mu&s;t &s;it to it, be ever about his Ma&s;ters bu&s;ine&s;s.

&s;pirit, is an excellent &s;pirit, and 'tis nece&s;&s;ary in a Chri&s;tian.</P>
<P N="1">1. An Active &s;pirit, is an Excellent &s;pirit: &s;lug|gards are the refu&s;e of the Earth.</P>
<P>But here it mu&s;t be con&s;idered, that there is a double Activity, Gracious and Natural.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Natural,</HI> which ari&s;es from an innate vigour and vivacity of &s;ome mens &s;pirits: There needs not indu&s;try in &s;uch, to bring forth action; 'tis but leaving nature to its cour&s;e, and that will flye high enough of it &s;elf. It requires more indu&s;try to regulate, and &s;ometimes to re&s;train, than to put forth into Action. Its more labour for them to re&s;t, than to be doing.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Gracious:</HI> Which is either Natural Activity, managed and improved for God, turn'd into a right cour&s;e, running into a right Channel; or a naturally unactive &s;pirit, rai&s;ed and quickned by Grace and Religious Indu&s;try. This gracious, this holy Activity, this is the Excellency; it is the extract of the &s;pirits and life of all our parts and graces, and will go further, and do more high honour, and more abundant &s;ervice to God &amp; his Go&s;pel, than is done by a thou&s;and others.</P>
<P>An Active &s;inner, is by accident the wor&s;t of men: How much &s;ervice for the Devil will he di&s;patch in a little time?</P>
<P>An Active Sinner is <HI>life and death met together.</HI> He is all life, and yet dead; and the more he hath of death, becau&s;e &s;o much of life; like poy|&s;on in Wine, he de&s;troys the more effectually:
<PB N="217" REF="000857_0222_0FADAB87223B9490">
Yet the evil is not in his Activity, but in the mat|ter wherein he is employed; the good mettal, as keens of a Weapon, is its Excellency: but in a mad mans hand, better a wooden than an iron &s;word. An Active Spirit is &s;o excellent, that it's pity that ever &s;in &s;hould have the u&s;ing of it; 'twas well for Religion, if the Devil were a Drone, and had no other Servants, but the Slug|gards of the Earth. But Activity when &s;et right, is of great price in the &s;ight of God, becau&s;e it &s;ets a great price upon God.

<P N="1">1. There's that <HI>within them</HI> that will fetch them back. Corrupt nature, the power of unmortified Lu&s;t, this is it that bears the &s;way in their hearts&punc; and however for the time, the &s;tream may be &s;omewhat turn'd out of its cour&s;e, or bay'd up&punc; however by the <HI>impetus</HI> of &s;ome external Motives or Arguments, or the <HI>impul&s;es</HI> of an awakened Con&s;cience, or &s;ome &s;udden heat of affection, they are carried on after, and in &s;ome fair com|pliance with the Lord Je&s;us; yet when the Bay is removed, when the external force is &s;pent, Con&s;cience laid to &s;leep, the heat affection allaid, which is often almo&s;t as &s;oon out as in, their very natures will reduce, and bring them back to their old cour&s;e.

(Hypocrites are often the fa&s;ter to Satan, for being &s;o near to Chri&s;t) the very Religion they have, is but the Devils &s;nare, by which he holds them back from Religion; yet le&s;t by venturing them too far, they &s;hould be lo&s;t to him at la&s;t, he that fir&s;t tempted them &s;o near to Chri&s;t, (Hy|pocrites are often beholding to the Devil for the Religion they have) will quickly tempt them back again.</P>

<P>It will be &s;aid, But if God hath undertaken all this for us, what is there then left on us to do?

us, what <HI>de facto</HI> we (&s;hall) be, is included a Pre|cept, wherein we may under&s;tand what <HI>de jure</HI> we (ought) to be.</P>
<P>In undertaking to give us a new heart, a tender and obedient, a per&s;evering heart, the Lord doth promi&s;e, both to make us what we &s;hould be, and to help us in what we are bound to do; and gives us at once a clear hint, both of our mercy and duty. This is the &s;ence &amp; &s;um of that promi&s;e, The Lord will work all that in us, and will help and cau&s;e us to perform all that which (is required) unto &s;alvation; and &s;o the <HI>Promi&s;sum</HI> on Gods part, doth not make void, but e&s;tabli&s;h the <HI>Debi|tum</HI> on ours, <HI>Do we then make void the Law through Faith? Nay, we establi&s;h the Law.</HI></P>
<P>Though it be certain as to the event, that all that's ne|ce&s;&s;ary to &s;alvation, &s;hall be accompli&s;hed in us; God hath undertaken that, yet it is altogether as certain, that God hath made our loving him, fearing him, obeying his whole will, and our &s;incerity and per&s;everance herein &s;o nece&s;&s;ary, that we cannot otherwi&s;e be &s;aved:</P>
<P>Chri&s;tians, mi&s;take not, nor abu&s;e the grace of the Go&s;pel. The Lord never meant your mercy &s;hould make void your obligation to duty. Redemption from &s;in, was never intended as a toleration of &s;in. He gives not his Spirit in favour of the fle&s;h. What he under|takes to work for you, was never with a mind to main|tain you in idlene&s;s, <HI>Tit.</HI> 2.11, 12. The Grace of God that bringeth &s;alvation, teacheth us, that denying ungod|line&s;s and worldly lu&s;ts, we &s;hould live &s;oberly, righte|ou&s;ly, and godly in this pre&s;ent world.</P>
<P>Though you are &s;aved by grace, yet you are &s;till (in a &s;en&s;e) debtors to the whole Law&punc; Perfect obedience to the whole Law, even to the utmo&s;t <HI>Iota,</HI> is &s;till due from you; and if it be not in your hearts to pay all that you owe, that is, if there be any duty commanded in the

whole Book of God, that you mu&s;t be di&s;pen&s;ed with, that you will not &s;et your hearts to ob&s;erve and obey; if there be any one &s;in that you ma&s;t be excu&s;ed in, and will not part with; if there be any, the highe&s;t pitch of holy Care, Activity, Indu&s;try, Zeal for God and Holine&s;s, that you will not be per&s;waded to pre&s;s hard after; this is an evidence of &s;uch an un&s;ound heart as hath no part in the Go&s;pel, or the &s;alvation thereof. Perfect|ion is &s;till due, though &s;incerity will be accepted. Sin|cerity &s;hall be accepted, but what is &s;incerity le&s;s than an hearty willingne&s;s to be perfect, atte&s;ted by a &s;triving &amp; pre&s;&s;ing on to that mark which is &s;et before us.</P>
<P>O admire and ble&s;s the Lord, the Lord for Grace; but do not turn the Grace of God into licentiou&s;ne&s;s Shall we continue in &s;in, becau&s;e Grace that abounded? Will ye thus requite the Lord? Will ye thus deceive your &s;elves, O fooli&s;h people and unwi&s;e? Will you &s;light him, becau&s;e he hath loved you?

Will you not run, becau&s;e he hath given you legs? Nor work becau&s;e he hath given you hands? Nor watch, becau&s;e he hath given you eyes? Or will you tempt the Lord, and call that your tru&s;t in him? Awake from &s;uch madne&s;s.</P>
<P>Chri&s;tians, &s;ay not (if God will, I &s;hall) whether I take care or no, believe or no, repent or no, be obedi|ent, or rebellious, whether I wake or &s;leep, work or be idle; my unbeleif, my di&s;obedience, my negligence &s;hall not make the faith of God of none effect.

<HEAD>CHAP. XX, and La&s;t. An Exhortation to the Saints.</HEAD>
<P>COme ye people, beloved, you that are highly favoured; The Lord is with you. Ble&s;&s;ed are you among&s;t men and women. The Lines are fallen to you in a plea&s;ant place, yea, you have goodly heritage. Come and enter upon your Lot; let your hearts be glad, let your glo|ry rejoyce, but that your joy may be full, hearken to tho&s;e following coun&s;els:</P>
<P><HI>Make &s;ure your intere&s;t in the Covenant.</HI></P>
<P>Rejoyce not in that that's none of thine. Make &s;ure, all lies upon this: Your life, and all the comforts and concernments of it, both your eter|nal &s;afety hereafter, and your &s;ucce&s;s in all the parts of your Chri&s;tian cour&s;e here, depend on your intere&s;t in the Covenant. What have you if Chri&s;t be not yours? and what have you in Chri&s;t, if you be not in Covenant? whence are your hopes, either of mercy at la&s;t, or of pro&s;pe|ring in any thing at pre&s;ent, but from the Covenant of Promi&s;e? And what have you thence, if your name be not in it? Oh give not re&s;t to your &s;elves, till this be put out of doubt; whatever duties you

perform, whatever ea&s;e or hope you find hereup|on, whatever tran&s;portation or affection you feel in your hearts, in the mid&s;t of all enquiry.</P>
<P><HI>But am I in Covenant?</HI> How &s;hall I know that, you'l &s;ay? why make a &s;trict and narrow enqui|ry, whether tho&s;e &s;pecial graces already mention|ed, be wrought upon you. Common mercies, though even the&s;e be Covenant mercies to the Saints, yet will they not prove them&s;elves &s;o to be; but &s;pecial graces will be their own evidence. Things outward, fall alike to all; <HI>No man knows love or hatred by ought that befals him, Eccle&s;.</HI> 9.1. Thou maye&s;t be a &s;on or a ba&s;tard, notwith&s;tan|ding all that thou enjoye&s;t or &s;uffere&s;t here; but not one of the fore-mentioned graces, but is a Childs portion, Gods mark upon the heart, to di|&s;tingui&s;h children from &s;trangers. Prove that thou truly knowe&s;t the Lord, ha&s;t one heart, a tender heart, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and thou therein prove&s;t thy &s;elf to be a child of Promi&s;e. Read over the de|&s;criptions that have been given of the&s;e graces; ob&s;erve diligently where the main difference lies betwixt common and &s;pecial grace; compare thine heart with it, and thereby thou maye&s;t give a judgment of thy &s;tate.

Get a &s;eeing eye, and keep your eye open; get a &s;ingle heart, and let it not be again divided; get a tender heart, and keep it tender; let the love and fear of God be acted in holy Obedience. An Obedient, Gracious, Watchful, Active life, will keep Grace in heart; and flouri&s;hing grace will &s;peak for it &s;elf and you. Look not that the Lord &s;hould &s;o far countenance your de|clinings to a more fle&s;hly carele&s;s &s;tate, as to &s;mile upon you in &s;uch a &s;tate; God will not be an Abettor to &s;in.
