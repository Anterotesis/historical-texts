<HEAD>THE SECOND PART, Containing, A Preparation for Death.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>THou Earthly Mortal Man, ob&s;erve this well,</L>
<L>If thou in Wickedne&s;s on Earth do dwell:</L>
<L>Then in a dying Hour may'&s;t thou find</L>
<L>The &s;ad effects of a di&s;quiet Mind.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>For in this World we have not long to live,</L>
<L>And when we come to die, what would we give</L>
<L>To be a&s;&s;ured of a Re&s;ting Place,</L>
<L>So &s;oon as we have run out Nature's Race.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Nothing but Sorrows do our Life attend,</L>
<L>Therefore let us think of our latter End;</L>
<L>That when we on the Bed of Sorrow lye;</L>
<L>We may have nothing el&s;e to do, but die.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Oh! let not Folly &s;teal thy Heart away,</L>
<L>Remember &s;till that there will come a Day,</L>
<L>That we to GOD a ju&s;t Account mu&s;t give,</L>
<L>How, well or ill, we here on Earth did live.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>He that a Holy, Upright Life will lead,</L>
<L>And fain would be a Chri&s;tian now indeed,</L>
<L>Mu&s;t &s;till approach the Throne of Grace, by Prayer,</L>
<L>Making Religion here his con&s;tant care.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In Blooming Youth 'tis be&s;t for to begin</L>
<L>To &s;eek the Lord, and take our leave of Sin;</L>
<L>For having early took a Righteous Way,</L>
<L>We are not then &s;o apt to go a&s;tray.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But often do we &s;ee the Blooming Youth</L>
<L>Delight in Sin, neglect the Word of Truth,</L>
<L>And think it time enough for to amend</L>
<L>Our evil ways when Life is at an End.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>No greater danger in the World can be</L>
<L>For our poor Souls, than &s;uch loo&s;e Liberty;</L>
<L>It cau&s;es Man Repentance to delay,</L>
<L>When we an't &s;ure to &s;ee another Day.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Why &s;hould poor Mortals eagerly pur&s;ue</L>
<L>Tho&s;e vain Delights, which will our Griefs renew;</L>
<L>For after Sinning Thirty, Forty Years,</L>
<L>It may occa&s;ion &s;ad repenting Tears.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And therefore now, before it is too late,</L>
<L>Let ev'ry one think of a Future State;</L>
<L>And on the Mercies of the Lord relie,</L>
<L>For who is he that lives, and &s;hall not Die?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And from your Duty do not turn a&s;ide,</L>
<L>But mind the Holy Bible, more than Pride,</L>
<L>In which the Righteous Law of God's reveal'd,</L>
<L>And will in time of trouble Comfort yield.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>I &s;peak to all of High and Low Degree,</L>
<L>Serve ye the Lord with true Sincerity;</L>
<L>The Rich as well as Poor have Souls to &s;ave,</L>
<L>And there is no Repentance in the Grave.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Brows that &s;weat for Kingdoms &amp; Renown</L>
<L>To Glorifie their Temples with a Crown,</L>
<L>Mu&s;t leave their Diadem when Death &s;hall call,</L>
<L><HI>Memento mori</HI> is the end of all.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Riches and Honour, Crowns and Dignity,</L>
<L>Tho&s;e fading Glories mo&s;t uncertain be;</L>
<L>Nothing &s;ub&s;tantial in this World we find,</L>
<L>But ev'ry thing is turning with the Wind.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet if in God alone we put our Tru&s;t,</L>
<L>Who is both Gracious, Merciful, and Ju&s;t,</L>
<L>Making his Holy Word our Rule and Guide,</L>
<L>'Tis better worth than all the World be&s;ide</L>
