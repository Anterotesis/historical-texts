<P>WHEREAS Several of his Maie&s;ties Subjects have of late years departed from the Alle|giance they owe unto His M<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" EXTENT="1 letter">je<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" EXTENT="1 letter">ty, and have thereupon Confederated together, and in Ho&s;tile manner have fitted out Ships and Ve&s;&s;els of War, under pretence of going again&s;t the <HI>French,</HI> His Maje&s;ties late Enemies, but in&s;tead thereof they have Roved in their &s;aid Ve&s;&s;els unto the Seas beyond the <HI>Cape of Good Hope,</HI> and upon the &s;aid Seas have Committed &s;everal Pyracyes and Robberies upon the Subjects of Forreign Princes and States in Amity with His Maje&s;ty, to the great Di&s;couragement of Trade, and to the open breach of &s;uch Treaties of Peace as have been made between His Maje&s;ty and his Allies. And whereas his mo&s;t Excellent Maje&s;ty, upon the Con&s;ideration of the good of His Subjects, and for the Security of Trade, hath thought fit to &s;ignifie unto me his Royal Will and Plea&s;ure, by his Grace the Duke of <HI>Shrewsbury,</HI> His Maje&s;ties Principal Secretary of State, That all Pyrates and Sea Rovers that &s;hall come within the Juri&s;diction of this Province, &s;hould be Suppre&s;&s;ed, and that Effectual care might be taken to Arre&s;t, Seize and &s;ecure the Ships, Per&s;ons and Effects of all &s;uch Pyrates and Sea Rovers, in order to the bringing of them to due puni&s;hment, as the Laws in &s;uch Ca&s;es do direct. And to the End that H<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" EXTENT="1 letter">s Maje&s;ties &s;aid Royal Will and Plea&s;ure may be the better and the more Effectually Executed, I have therefore thought fit, by and with the Advice of His Maje&s;ties Council, &s;trictly to Charge and Command all Ju<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" EXTENT="1 letter">tices, Sheriffs and other Commi&s;&s;ion Officers, in their &s;everal Precincts within this Province, upon his or their Knowledge or Notice given, That any Privateer, Pyrate or other Per&s;ons &s;u&s;pected to be upon any Unlawful De&s;ign, are kept and concealed in any place within their re&s;pective Precincts, that they thereupon i&s;&s;ue their Warrants to &s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" EXTENT="1 letter">ze, apprehend and carry &s;uch Per&s;ons to the common Goal of their re&s;pective Precincts, where they are to rema<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" EXTENT="1 letter">n until they be from thence d<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;charged by due cour&s;e of Law. And all others His Maje&s;ties Leige Subjects are hereby &s;trictly Required to be aiding and a&s;&s;i&s;ting to the Ju&s;tices, Sheriffs, and other Commi<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ion Officers in their &s;everal Precincts acc<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" EXTENT="1 letter">rdingly, as they will an&s;wer the contrary at their Peril.</P>
