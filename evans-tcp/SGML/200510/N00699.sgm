<HEAD>His Excellency, THE Earl of BELLOMONT HIS SPEECH To the Repre&s;entatives of his Maje&s;ties Province of <HI>New-York,</HI> the 19^t^h of <HI>May,</HI> 1698.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Gentlemen;</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>MY Voyage hither from <HI>England</HI> was very tedious, and attended with great Hard&s;hips; but &s;ince my being among you I have endeavoured to redeem that lo&s;s of Time, by applying my &s;elf diligently to the Publick Bu&s;ine&s;s, in Duty to His Maje&s;ty, and that I might be the better enabled to &s;erve you.</P>
<P>I cannot But ob&s;erve to you what a Legacy my Predece&s;&s;or has left me, and what Difficulties to &s;truggle with, A Divided People, an empty Trea&s;ury, a few mi&s;erable, naked, half-&s;tarv'd Souldiers, not half the Number the King allow'd pay for; the Fortifications, and even the Go|vernours Hou&s;e very much out of Repair; and in a word, <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> the whole Government out of Frame. To you therefore I recommend the con&s;ideration of the&s;e Di&s;orders, as be&s;t becoming your Prudence to apply the proper Remedies; and you may be &s;ure of my hearty Concurrence in every thing that will conduce to the extingui&s;hing tho&s;e Heats and Annimo&s;ities among you, which I fear have been of late years indu&s;tri|ou&s;ly cheri&s;h't and fomented, and to the curing all the other Di&s;orders and Mi&s;chiefs a<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">ng you.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="000845_0002_0FABA1566B5EFF30">It hath been repre&s;ented to the Government in <HI>England,</HI> That this Province hath been a noted Receptacle of Pyrates, and the Trade of it under no Re&s;triction, but the Acts of Trade violated, by the Neglect and Connivance of tho&s;e who&s;e Duty it was to have prevented it. I hope, <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> you will put all the Di&s;countenance imaginable on that flagi|tious Crime of <HI>Pyracy,</HI> which is not only the wor&s;t &s;ort of Robbery, but is, for the mo&s;t part attended with the horrid Sin of Murder, which is a great aggravation of that odious Practice, dete&s;ted by all the Civil Nations of the World. 'Tis not only injurious to the Honour of his Maje&s;ty, and the Engli&s;h Nation, but al&s;o highly prejudicial to the Trade of <HI>England,</HI> and particularly to the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Company. And the Gentlemen of the Council here pre&s;ent will bear me witne&s;s, that my Orders from his Maje&s;ty are very &s;trict for enquiring into, and effectually preventing for the future that Lawle&s;s and Vile Trade of Pyracy within all my Governments.</P>
<P>As I have declared my &s;elf again&s;t Pyracy, and all Unlawful Trade, &s;o I mu&s;t a&s;&s;ure you I will give you all the Encouragement I can po&s;&s;ibly in carrying on a lawful Trade, and every thing el&s;e that will make you Happy and Flouri&s;hing.</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Speaker, and you Gentlemen Repre&s;entatives;</HI></P>
<P>I Hope you will take into your Con&s;iderations, That the Revenue is near expiring, and that you will provide for the Support of the Go|vernment for time to come; and therein give me leave to put you in mind, that your Duty and Re&s;pect to his Maje&s;ty &s;hould be an argument to you, not to leave the Government de&s;titute. It would be hard, if I that come among you with an hone&s;t mind, and a Re&s;olution to be ju&s;t to your Intere&s;t, &s;hould meet with greater Difficulties in the di&s;charge of His Maje&s;ties Service than tho&s;e that have gone before me. I will take care there &s;hall be no Mi&s;-application of the Publick Money: I will Pocket none of it my &s;elf, nor &s;hall there be any Imbezilment by others, but exact Accounts &s;hall be given you, when and as often as you &s;hall require.</P>
<P>I have ordered all the Accounts to be laid before you, that you may &s;ee the &s;tate of the Debts of the Government, and take &s;uch cour&s;e for the Di&s;charge of them as you &s;hall think fit. I wi&s;h too you would con&s;ider how to re&s;tore Credit to the Government, which I under&s;tand is now very low, if not wholly lo&s;t.</P>
<P>I have <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">dered the Engineer to go and vi&s;it the Fronteers, and to report to me the State and Condition he finds the Fortifications in, which Report I intend for you, as &s;oon as it comes to my hands.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="000845_0003_0FABA15806BC9818"><HI>Gentlemen,</HI> I mu&s;t remind you of the Nece&s;&s;ity there is of finding out &s;ome Expedient to reconcile the Parties among you. I mu&s;t own to you, I &s;et my heart &s;o much on it, that I &s;hall think it the Glory of my Government to bring &s;o good a Work to pa&s;s. I de&s;ire therefore you will think of the proper Methods to effect an entire Reconciliation among you. To be of one Faith and one Mind is not only an excellent Scripture Rule, but al&s;o a good Maxim in Government. Union among&s;t a People is the Bond of Peace, and of Strength too.</P>
<P>You cannot but know what Abu&s;es have been formerly in Elections of Members to &s;erve in the A&s;&s;embly, which tends much to the Subver&s;ion of your Liberties. I do there<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">re recommend to you the making a Law to provide again&s;t it, and that you will think of &s;uch other Laws as you will &s;tand in need of to &s;ecure to this Province a la&s;ting Happine&s;s, to which I promi&s;e you my Concurrence.</P>
<P>I &s;hall conclude, <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> with recommending that which is chiefly incumbent on us all, an Inviolable Duty and Allegiance to his Maje&s;ty, who by his Valour has re&s;cued us from the two greate&s;t Plagues that ever infe&s;ted the World, <HI>Popery</HI> and <HI>Slavery,</HI> and by that, and his Wi&s;e and Temperate Government has &s;ecur'd us the free Exerci&s;e of our holy <HI>Prote&s;tant Religion,</HI> the enjoyment of our Liberties and E&s;tates. And as a further In&s;tance and Illu&s;tration of the Glory of his Reign, His Maje&s;ty has, with repeated hazards of his precious Life, procured for Us and all <HI>Chri&s;tendom,</HI> a glorious Peace; for which, <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> let Us Addre&s;s his Maje&s;ty, That he will be graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to accept of the tender of our mo&s;t humble Duty and Thanks.</P>
