<HEAD>Water-Baptism Plainly proved by SCRIPTURE to be a GOSPEL PRECEPT.</HEAD>
<P>BEing presented with a Paper, by a Friend of the Society of the People called Quakers, it being a leaf or two of a Book late written by <HI>George Keith</HI>: The principal Scope of the said Paper is comprehended in these particulars;
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. <HI>That the Baptism with Water doth properly and only belong to</HI> Johns <HI>Ministry and Dispensation.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. <HI>That there is no Command from God for Water-Baptism.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>3. <HI>That the Apostles practised it only by permission for a time, as they did o|ther Ceremonies of the Law, and not by any Gospel standing Commission.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="000498_0003_0FA6765A9BBB6550">This being the substance of the Paper, it is needless to mention every Line, I shall endeavour as the Lord shall assist me reply to these Con|clusions&punc;</P>
<P>The first of these being esteemed among these People as <HI>Goliah</HI> was in the Camp of the <HI>Philistims, I</HI> trust by the improving of a Sling and a few Stones chosen out of the Book of the Holy Scriptures to oppose and destroy, that a Gospel Ordinance be not by them defied&punc;</P>
<P>Therefore contrary to this Conclusion, <HI>I</HI> do assert, That the Baptiz|ing Believers in Jesus Christ with Water, is a part of Christs Baptism, began by <HI>John,</HI> but carried on by Christ; and to remain throughout the Gospel Dispensation.</P>
<P N="2">2. I do affirm, That the outward Form, and inward Power of God|liness may not be separated, but remain and abide together in the Church of the Living God, the Pillar and Ground of Truth.</P>
<P>First, For proof whereof, take notice of what is written by <HI>Mark,</HI> at the beginning, 1.2. and third <HI>verses,</HI> noting <HI>Johns</HI> Baptism to be the beginning of the Gospel of Jesus Christ the Son of God: as it is writ|ten, <HI>Behold I send my Messenger, that shall prepare thy way before thee</HI>: Here is plainly noted, That the Preaching and Baptizing by <HI>John,</HI> is a part of the Gospel Dispensation, and although it were acted under the Law, as also Christ was under the Law, yet his work related to Christs Gospel Dispensation, and is plainly distinguished from the Law and the Pro|phets, for it is written: <HI>The Law and the Prophtes were until John, but <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> the day of</HI> John <HI>the Baptist, the Kingdom of Heaven suffereth violence, and the violent take by Force</HI>; nor was Water-Baptism any otherwise <HI>Johns,</HI> then the Law of God was called <HI>Moses's</HI> Law, he being the M<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">|nister thereof; and it was the Devils dispute, that the Law ended with <HI>Moses</HI>: So also was Christ the Minister of that part of Christs Gospel: nor is there any mention of a third dispensation, that is neither Law-nor Gospel of <HI>Johns,</HI> as is imagined; <HI>Paul</HI> treating of the Ministrati+ons, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 3. treats only of two, Law and Gospel, Letter and Spirit: when one was to be chosen in the room of <HI>Judas,</HI> he must be one be|ginning from the Baptism of <HI>John,</HI> so <HI>Peter, Acts</HI> 10. begins the word of Peace by Jesus Christ at <HI>Johns</HI> Baptism.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>John</HI> is called Christs Messenger, the Message of <HI>John</HI> was his, and upon his account not <HI>Johns</HI>&punc;</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="3" REF="000498_0004_0FA6765E85390558">3. <HI>John</HI> was sent to prepare Christs way, teaching believing in him that was to come; and as soon as Christ doth manifest himself, declareth him to be come: saying, <HI>Behold the Lamb of God, that taketh away the sins of the world.</HI> So that it is plain, That baptizing repenting Believers in Christ with Water, was then the way of Christ began and prepared by <HI>John.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Johns</HI> Preaching and Baptizing, was the way provided of God for them that believed and obeyed, to escape the wrath to come: for saith <HI>John</HI> to some coming to his Baptism: <HI>Who hath fore-warned you to flee from the wrath to come, Mat.</HI> 3.7 &amp; is agreeable with Christs words, <HI>Mark</HI> 16. <HI>He that believeth and is Baptized, shall be saved.</HI> Therefore it is said the Publicans iustified God being baptized of <HI>John,</HI> but the Pharisees and Lawyers rejected the counsel of God against themselves, being not bap|tized of <HI>John,</HI> his work and Ministry being from Heaven.</P>
<P N="5">5. Because Christ himself submits to it, as Gods righteous way suffer it to be; so saith he to <HI>John</HI> when he cometh to him to be baptized of him, <HI>for it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. Because God bear witness to it from Heaven, both by voice, and giving the Holy Ghost to his Sons Obedience.</P>
<P N="7">7. Because the Lord Jesus himself takes up with water-baptism, not only by obeying to it, but also dispensing the same with <HI>John</HI> in his day&punc; and when it was told to <HI>John,</HI> that He, to whom he bear witness that was with him beyond <HI>Jordan, the same baptizeth, and all men come to him; John</HI> is so far from counting him therein an intruder into his work and Ministry, that he readily and joyfully confesseth, That, that work did of right belong to him, owning that he received his Commission from him, and was sent by him; saith he, <HI>a man can receive nothing except it be given him from above; but declareth him to be from above, and above all,</HI> John 3. <HI>He that is of the earth is earthly: therefore he must increase: but I a man of the earth must decrease</HI>; giving him the pre-heminence both in the work of baptizing, and in all other things: saying, <HI>after me cometh a man that is preferred before me, for he was before me; and of his fullness have all we received, and grace for grace</HI>; and it is plain by Scripture, that the Lord Jesus took up this work, to carry it on, even of Water-baptism as i<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"> said, <HI>John</HI> 4.1. when the Lord knew that the Pharisees had heard that <HI>Jesus made and baptized more Disciples than</HI> John, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> So that he
<PB N="4" REF="000498_0005_0FA67660EC7E9C18">
did it not in a corner, nor to a few, but out-went <HI>John</HI> in baptizing; but if it be replyed, that Jesus himself baptized not, but his Disciples, I answer, that makes no more against what I have said, than for any to say, that <HI>Solomon</HI> did not build the first Temple, nor <HI>Zerubbabel</HI> the Se|cond; which although they did not the servile Labour, yet all was by their Command, Commission and Authority; even so was the baptiz|ing done by Christs Disciples, it was his work, and by his Power and Command; whose assistance went along with them as their Lord and Master, and that their baptizing was with Water, is plain: first, because it is compared to the work of <HI>John</HI>: So it is presented both to <HI>John</HI> and to the Pharisees. 2. Because it is said, Jesus himself baptized not, but his Disciples; had it been only the Spiritual part of Baptism, it could not have been so said, for baptizing with the Spirit, is only Christs' Prero|gative; yet is it said, Jesus made and baptized more Disciples than <HI>John,</HI> sure he did it not to <HI>John</HI> as his Baptism, for that were to make <HI>John</HI> Lord, and Jesus Servant, but they did it to him, and for him, as Lord of all, not as <HI>Johns</HI> first Testimony, that they should believe on him that was to come, but to him whom they witnessed was come; but true it is this their Command and Commission extended, but to the Land of <HI>Israel,</HI> as also <HI>Johns</HI> did, &amp; until they had received from their Lord more Power, and larger Commission were there limited.</P>
<P N="8">8. Therefore when the Lord had finished the work of Redemption by his death, and was raised up from the Dead, and had all power given him in heaven and earth, he then inlargeth his Commission and Com|mand to his Disciples: saying, <HI>go into all the world, and teach all Nations, baptizing them in the Name of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded, and lo I am with you always to the end of the world</HI>: he doth not tell them (as the simpleness and folly, or rather deceitfulness of the Quakers would carry it) well, I have now put an end to Water-baptism, which did properly and only belong to <HI>Johns</HI> Ministry and Dispensation, and now your work is to baptize onely with my Baptism of the Spirit all Nations; nor did his Disciples so un|derstand his great Commission, <HI>Mat.</HI> 28. to intend.</P>
<P N="9">9. When the Disciples had received the promis<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">d holy Spirit, that was to be their guide and order to inable them to be Christs Witnesses
<PB N="5" REF="000498_0006_0FA6766280F481C0">
to the people in the power of this Spirit, they went forth, the Lord working with them and confirming his Word by signs following, <HI>Mark</HI> 16.20. But let it be minded, how did these chosen Apostles and Disci|ples carry on this work of Christ; for now it is undeniable, that the Ministration of the Spirit is begun, and by the Holy Spirit, they are led it being poured on them to the admiration of all the dwellers on earth, <HI>Acts</HI> 2.5. See their work first at Jerusalem, how powerfully did the ho|ly Spirit convince the <HI>Jews</HI> that had killed the Prince of Life, whom God raised up; so that upon hearing <HI>Peters</HI> testimony, not of killing the Light within, as the Quakers Preach, but of that holy Child Jesus, who was of the fruit of <HI>Davids</HI> Loyns according to the flesh, yet the only begotten Son of God, according to the Spirit of holiness, they were pricked in their hearts, and said to <HI>Peter,</HI> and the rest of the Apostles, <HI>Men and Brethren what shall we do? Peter guided by the Spirit,</HI> answereth: <HI>Repent and be baptized every one of you</HI> (mind it, every one that expects Salvation) <HI>in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and you shall rece<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">ve the gift of the Holy Ghost</HI>; this can be no otherwise taken then of Water-baptism, as to the first part, and spirit baptism in the second part, otherwise to render it only Spirit, as the Quakers suggest, is to charge the spirit of God in <HI>Peter</HI> with gross impertinencies and tautologies, as if he should say, Repent and be baptized with the holy spirit, and you shall receive the holy spirit: but the Spirits Teaching in it indeed is plain, that repenting Believers baptized with Water (being a sign and Token from God to them of the remission of sins) are the only true Heirs of the promise of the Holy Ghost, which God doth also give to them that obey him, and to look for this blessed promise otherwise than in his own way, is as to seek the living among the dead.</P>
<P>So again, <HI>Acts</HI> 8. <HI>Philip</HI> the Evangelist led by the spirit of God, went down to the Cities of <HI>Samaria,</HI> and Preached Christ to them, to whom it is said, <HI>they with one accord gave heed, and believing they were baptized both Men and Women</HI>; and that this was Water baptism, is undeniable, because it is said after that: when <HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>John were</HI> sent from Jerusa|lem to further that work of Christ even to put them in Gods orderly way, they prayed for them, <HI>That they might receive the Holy Ghost, for as yet he was fallen on none of them, only they were baptized in the name of
<PB N="6" REF="000498_0007_0FA67662D3DB7B18">
the Lord Jesus,</HI> and <HI>verse</HI> 29. <HI>the Spirit said to Philip go near, and joyn thy self to this Chariot</HI> to wit, of the Ethiopian Eunuch, and having by the leadings of the holy spirit, Preached the Lord Jesus to him, and the will of God touching Believers Obedience to the baptism with Water for Remission of sins; (for without so considering it, though not at large expressed) no reason can be given why he should say when he came to a certain Water: <HI>Lo, here is Water, what hindreth me that I should not be baptized; he saith, if thou believest with all thine heart, thou mayest; and up|on his Confession of his faith in Jesus, he commanded the Chariot to stand still, and they went down both into the Water, and he baptized him, and the spirit of the Lord caught away</HI> Philip: So that in all his work the spirit of the Lord accompanieth him, approving and allowing of what he did as an holy Messenger of Christ: which of the Quakers have trod this path of Christs holy Spirits Teaching? but kicking against it: promote and set up the imaginations and devices of their own hearts.</P>
<P>But let us trace their way yet farther, and see how <HI>Peter</HI> is guided of God towards the Gentiles to take of them a people for his Sons Name, who is the light to the Gentiles, and the glory of his people Israel,</P>
<P><HI>Cornelius, Acts</HI> 10. being warned of God by an holy Angel to call for <HI>Peter,</HI> who should speak words whereby he and all his house should be saved; and when he is come, he saith also, <HI>we are all here present be|fore God, to hear all things that are commanded thee of God</HI>: while <HI>Peter</HI> is (speaking; not mentioning ought of the light within, although we de|ny it not where God would have it spoken of) but testifying to Jesus of <HI>Nazareth</HI> whom God anoynted with the Holy Ghost, who went a|bout <HI>doing good, whom they slew and hanged on a Tree, whom God raised up and shewed him openly,</HI> not to all but to chosen ones: To whom God commanded to teach and preach him to be the Judg of quick and dead: this saith he is he to whom all the Prophets witness, <HI>that through his Name whosoever believeth in him shall receive Remission of sins:</HI> while he is thus speaking, <HI>the Holy Ghost fell upon all them that heard the Word to the astonishment of them that came with Peter</HI>; then said <HI>Peter can any man for|bid Water that these should not be baptized, that have received the Holy Ghost as well as we; and he commanded them to be baptized in the Name of the Lord Jesus</HI>&punc; Surely Peter stood in the awe and fear of God, and leading
<PB REF="000498_0008_0FA676639F6A9658">
of his Spirit, speaking nothing but what God Commanded him, nei|ther was there any ground here to use or comply with any legal Cere|mony to move him to this work of baptizing with Water, but only as it was his Lord Christs Commission and Command, and teaching of his Spirit; for they were <HI>Gentiles,</HI> upon whom the Apostles of Christ laid not legal Institutions and Commandments, but as Ministers of the Spirit, not of the Letter, neither did, nor could injoyn them to any thing that Christ had not commanded them: And here I desire it may be minded, and soberly considered by all that read; the plain difference between the teaching of the holy Spirit in the Apostle <HI>Peter,</HI> sent of Christ, and the Spirit by which the <HI>Quakers</HI> speak, and are guided in this matter. <HI>Peter</HI> beholding Gods Promise fulfilled in giving his ho|ly Spirit to the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> makes that a forceable Argument to press their Obedience to Water-baptism, Gods orderly way for the Planting of the Gospel Church: but plain contrary to this, as light is to darkness, is that the <HI>Quakers</HI> spirit leads unto; by which as <HI>John</HI> saith, we may try their Spirit, whether it be of God or no, who making a pretence to have the holy Spirit, and to be acted and guided thereby, cry down wa|ter-baptism, as of no use to them that have the Spirits Baptism; but so did not <HI>Peter,</HI> who was sent truly of God, and spake as he commanded him, sheweth, that the receiving the Holy Ghost did not exempt Believ|ers from Water baptism, but rather strongly engage them thereunto, as the order of Gods House, for so the words of <HI>Peter</HI> do demonstrate; that all Believers in Christ did attend to this Order of Water-baptism&punc; else it had been impertinent for <HI>Peter</HI> so to have said: nay, not onely impertinent but sinful and wicked, to cause the <HI>Gentiles</HI> to be obedient to Commandments of men; no Christian may dare entertain such thoughts of Christs holy Apostles and Messengers, who Preached not themselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord; and saith <HI>Paul</HI> to the <HI>Romans; I will not dare to speak of the things that Christ hath not wrought by me, to make the Gentiles obedient by word or deed</HI>; and again he saith, <HI>if any man think himself a Prophet or Spiritual, let him acknowledg, that the things I write are the Com|mandments of God.</HI> Such were all the things they wrote or spake by way of Commandment, to believe in Jesus: yet we may see <HI>Keith</HI> and others, pretended Ministers of the Spirit, but not guided by that Spirit Christs
<PB N="8" REF="000498_0009_0FA676648E1B2138">
Ministers were, but by a spirit of delusion, dare thus plainly with <HI>Eli|mas</HI> the Sorcerer, being full of subtilty and mischief, pervert the right ways of the Lord, abusing the Apostles of Christ, as if they should com|mand in Christ Jesus the Lords name, and that to the <HI>Gentiles</HI> too, such things as were abolished Ceremonies, which saith <HI>Keith,</HI> they tolerated and used for a time by permission, and not by any Gospel standing Com|mission; <HI>I</HI> own what <HI>Paul</HI> saith, to the <HI>Jew,</HI> he became a <HI>Jew,</HI> to gain the <HI>Jew,</HI> condescending to their weakness in some legal Ceremonies for a time, for the sakes of some that believed, yet zealous of the Law; but it is evident, they did not impose on the <HI>Gentiles</HI> nor <HI>Jews</HI> neither by way of Command, any thing that Christ had not commanded them, as is plain, <HI>Acts</HI> 21.25. as touching the <HI>Gentiles</HI> that believe, said <HI>James</HI> and the Elders, <HI>we have written to them, that they observe no such things as Circumcision or legal Ceremonies</HI>; but we see <HI>Peter</HI> commands in the name of the Lord Jesus, the <HI>Gentile</HI> Believers and <HI>Jews</HI> also <HI>Acts</HI> 2. to be Bap|tized with Water, yea, although they were first filled with the Holy Ghost; and it is worth noting too, that although <HI>Peter</HI> was put in mind by the holy spirit, of the words of the Lord Jesus, according to his Pro|mise, <HI>John</HI> 14.26. <HI>he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance,</HI> and in special that word, <HI>John baptized you with water, but ye shall be baptized with the holy Ghost,</HI> when he saw the Spirit poured on the Gentiles: yet this was no impediment to <HI>Peter</HI> to forward those be|lievers in the way of Christs commands, and order of his House, to that despised Ordinance of Water-baptism, stirring up their pure minds, as after he exhorts the Saints to be mindful of the words of the holy Pro|phets, and of the commandment of the Apostles of the Lord and Sa|viour Jesus Christ; knowing that in the last days there would come <HI>Scoffers, walking after their own lust, saying, where is the Promise of his Co|ming</HI>? and <HI>Paul</HI> to the <HI>Theslalonians</HI> fore-seeing that Anti-christ and Man of sin arising, stirreth up the Saints to <HI>stand fast, and hold the Tradi|tions they had been taught by word or Epistle</HI>: and saith <HI>Jude</HI> a Servant of Jesus Christ, <HI>contend for the Faith once delivered to the Saints,</HI> and saith <HI>Paul Cor.</HI> 1.11. <HI>I commend you Brethren, that you remember me in all things, and keep the Ordinances as I delivered them to you:</HI> but these boasters of the Spirit being as clouds without water, carried about with wind, make it
<PB N="9" REF="000498_0010_0FA676651380D410">
their work to <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">at out as a canker, as <HI>Hymeneus</HI> and <HI>Philetus</HI> did the Faith of the Gospel, and Ordinances of the Lord Jesus, wresting the Scrip|tures, as <HI>Peter</HI> by the spirit did foretel to their own destruction.</P>
<P>But yet further we may observe the footsteps of Christs Flock very exemplary for the lovers of Jesus to go after, as the spirit of God by <HI>Solomon</HI> long ago directed, <HI>Song of Solomon</HI> 1.8.</P>
<P><HI>Acts</HI> 9. saith <HI>Ananias</HI> to <HI>Saul,</HI> being sent of the Lord to him, the Lord having called him to believe; <HI>and now why tarriest thou, arise and be bap|tized, and wash away thy sins</HI>: that here was water-baptism as well as spi|rit-baptism, is evident, for though <HI>Ananias by</HI> Gods appointment put his hands on him, to the end he might receive his sight, and be filled with the holy Ghost, yet there was something for <HI>Saul</HI> to be active and passive in, to the will of Jesus of <HI>Nazareth,</HI> that had called him even to arise and be baptized which must needs be of Water, for as before hath been hinted in order to receiving the holy Ghost, it is only required to repent and be baptized; certain, <HI>Saul</HI> did repent, but he must also give up him|self professedly to Jesus, whom he had persecuted, as well as other Dis|ciples. So again, see <HI>Acts</HI> 16. this was <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Silas</HI> way to the Con|verted Jaylor and his Houshold, and to <HI>Lydia</HI> and her Houshold; upon their believing: And now let me come to the <HI>Corinthians, Acts</HI> 18. there we find <HI>Crispas</HI> the Ruler of the Synagogue believing in the Lord, and many of the <HI>Corinthians</HI> hearing, believed and were baptized. I shall not need here to seek to prove this Baptism with Water, because the <HI>Quakers</HI> readily own it, supposing they have advantage against the bap|tizing with Water from this Scripture, for saith <HI>Keith,</HI> and it is usually coakt at by them: <HI>Paul</HI> saith, <HI>I was not sent to baptize, but to preach the Gospel</HI>; and it was strange to think, that <HI>Paul</HI> would thank God that he did not so fully obey the Gospel Rule. <HI>Answ.</HI> first, if these should be put to prove this water-baptism, they would find it as difficult as for o|thers to prove the Commission, <HI>Mat</HI> 28. to intend Water, it being in neither so expressed in so many words, and hereby we may see the shifts and devices they make every way for their own ends, to oppose Truth, but be it so, I shall grant this as the former and orderly way of Christ commanded by his Messengers; for otherwise how should these every where as appeareth where the Word is received, be found so obey|ing
<PB N="10" REF="000498_0011_0FA6766926593AF0">
and yielding to it: the reason why <HI>Paul</HI> so saith, and thanketh God that he baptized no more of them, than <HI>Crispus,</HI> &amp; <HI>Gaius</HI> and the Houshold of <HI>Stephanas,</HI> was not, because it was not a Gospel Ordinance, and com|prehended in <HI>Pauls</HI> commission, for then he had done evil in that he did in baptizing so many, &amp; of the first fruits to Christ there, &amp; persons of great eminency, and were after employed as Ministers in the Gospel as may be made appear to put them upon obedience to that Christ had not commanded; this <HI>Paul</HI> dared not to do as is aforesaid, nor can it be ra|tionably so considered; the ground of <HI>Pauls</HI> so saying, is clear, was oc|casioned by the divisions Satan had drawn them into; to dote upon men whom Christ imployed; some one <HI>Paul,</HI> some one <HI>Apollo,</HI> others one <HI>Cephas,</HI> not considering that they were all of them by Profession Baptiz|ed to Christ Jesus; we are ready to idolize them that did baptize them&punc; upon this ground he thanks God that he baptized no more of them, lest they should dote on him, and give him the honour due to Christ; for saith he, <HI>Christ sent me not to Baptize, but to Preach the Gospel</HI>; with this word the <HI>Quakers,</HI> and many opposers of the way of Christ please their vain fancies, as if they had a clear word for their opposition to Water-baptism; but indeed that which is here inferred, is only this, al|though baptizing was a Gospel command for every one that believed in the Lord Jesus, to submit unto&punc; and so be planted thereby into the like|ness of his Death, Burial, and Resurrection, yet it was not so bound to <HI>Paul</HI> or any other, sent to Preach the Gospel, that they with their own hands must needs perform that work of baptizing; but another Disciple although not so indowed for Preaching, might be instrumental in that Service of baptizing, and therefore we find the Apostles had such and such for their Ministers, as <HI>John, Timothy</HI> and others; this is all that can be truly drawn from this of <HI>Paul,</HI> and makes nothing to the purpose for which it is produced;</P>
<P>Christ having began his work by his Doctrine of Repentance, Faith, and Water baptism, goeth forward to compleat by his Spiritual Baptism, beautifying his Temple with gifts of his Spirit, this spiritual House of God was lively set forth by his material Temple, whose foundation was of stones, cut out of the Mountains, and also Timber-work; but the adorning of it, and finishing work, was of silver, gold, and precious
<PB N="11" REF="000498_0012_0FA6766BACF575E0">

<P>The Beloved Disciple <HI>John,</HI> who was the least of the Pen-men of holy Scripture, and had been an eye-witness of the power and Coming of the Lord Jesus, as well as <HI>Peter,</HI> who also had leaned on his bosome, and whose hands had handled of the word of life: he testifieth of the true Jesus Christ, saying, <HI>this is he that came by water and blood,</HI> 1 <HI>John</HI> 5.6. Not by water only, but by water and blood, and it is the Spirit that beareth witness, because the Spirit is Truth: here the Spirit by <HI>John</HI> brings those Gospel Ordinances appointed of God for a remembrance of his death for them by the memorial of the Cup of Blessing, the Com|munion of his Blood, and of the washing away their Sins, signified in the water of Baptism, as was said by <HI>Peter</HI> to them, <HI>Acts</HI> 2. <HI>Repent and be baptized every one of you&punc; for the Remission of sins</HI>; and saith <HI>An<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">nias</HI> to <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">aul, ari<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">e, and be baptized, and wash away thy sins</HI>: this being to Be|lievers a sign given of God, and a witness on earth that God hath given to <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> eternal life in his Son; <HI>for there are three that bear witness on earth to the grace of God in Christ,</HI> as well as three in heaven; to wit, <HI>the Spirit, the Water, and the Blood.</HI></P>

<P N="3">3. The Memorial of his blood given in command to his Disciples, and practised by Believers, <HI>Jews,</HI> and <HI>Gentiles</HI>; these are standing wit|nesses of the grace of Life given of God in his Son. Christ having so commanded and ordained these testimonies of himself, both by his own submission to the will of God herein, and giving this forth as a part of his Law: that <HI>John</HI> might plainly declare what Christ witnessed too in opposition to the spirit of Antichrist, that he saw arising to oppose the true Jesus saith as before: <HI>this is he that came by water and blood,</HI> doubling this Sentence, not by water only, which was first in Commission; but by water and blood: also the Author to the <HI>Hebrews,</HI> treating of the first principles of the Oracles of God, and Doctrine of Christ, makes the Doctrine of Baptism, and laying on of hands, as part of these, not laying again the foundation of Repentance, Faith, Baptism, laying on of hands, Resurrection of the Dead, and Eternal Judgment.</P>
<P>And saith <HI>John,</HI> 2 <HI>Epistle</HI> 9.

<P>In short, saith <HI>Keith,</HI> if they that are so zealous for Water-baptism, were cordially zealous for the inward and spiritual Baptism, they might be the more born with, as men bear with Children, that use likeness and figures of things that suit with the ages and state of Children; and Charity might be allowed them in that case to be as Children or Babes in Christ.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="000498_0014_0FA6766E172B8C90">Here we may note the pride that this boaster is filled with, counting even the Master-builders of Gods House, but Children in comparison of them; for as I have before proved by the Testimony of many Scrip|tures, that Christ and his holy Apostles, were zealous of Gods way and order, as to the outward form, as <HI>Paul</HI> saith to <HI>Timothy, hold fast the form of soundness which thou hast heard of me</HI>; and saith he, <HI>I charge thee before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, that thou keep this Commandment without spot, unrebukable, till the appearing of Jesus Christ:</HI> commending Saints for keeping the Ordinances as he delivered them, and in particular men|tions that Ordinance of the Lords Supper; which according as he recei|ved of the Lord, he delivered to them: but supposing them cordially zealous for the inward too, he extends some Charity towards them as Children and Babes in Christ, using figures according to their time and age: but the Generation of <HI>Quakers</HI> it seems are got into an higher de|gree of stature and fullness, thinking they are in an higher dispensation then they had attained: <HI>but let him that thinketh he Standeth, take heed lest he fall</HI>; although he grant there may be such a state of Childhood, as may use such things for a time, as outward Ordinances, and wait therein for the inward and spiritual appearances of Christs Kingdom: but their Ministry and Dispensation is above it, and are born Monsters, not Babes to be fed with Milk, as the Saints heretofore; the least of their babes d<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">spising or outward Ordinances, pretending to inward Revelations: but these saith he who are altogether for the outward Baptism &amp; Supper wholly, and deny the inward and spiritual Baptism, no such Charity for them; and truly I think so too: that such as wholly deny the inward power of the holy spirit, resting in the outward form, to be no other than he saith: but such extreams are much alike, to pretend to the pow|er, and deny the form of godliness, is as hipocritical as the other is formal: saith <HI>Paul</HI> to the <HI>Romans,</HI> and thanks God for it; <HI>you have obeyed from the heart, to the form of Doctrine that was delivered to you</HI>; but the will of God is the form and power to go together, nor can it be proved that any Christian did seek to separate the true form and order of Gods House, and yet pretend to live in the power and life; and there|fore when we find any attempting this, to destroy one by exalting the

<P>And now because in his Paper he strikes as well at the Lords Supper, as at Water baptism, as he that reads his Book may see at large; after he hath daubed with untempered mortar about it, summs up the matter that the common eating that they use, is the eating the Lords Supper, whether two or three more, or less, but the great design is plain to eat out the Lords Supper as nothing, with the rest of Gospel Ordi|nances and Commands, under the pretences of spirituality, which in|deed Believers are to walk in, in all their holy service they perform, li|ving in the spirit, and walking in the spirit; but to pretend thereto, on|ly to make void plain Commandments, is of no use: is but deceitful and hypocritical: The Lord Jesus instituted that service, a memorial of his death; and this he commanded them to do in remembrance of his; and the Saints attended it not as common eating, but as a special ap|pointment for a special end; and <HI>Paul</HI> saith, <HI>when ye come together to eat, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">arry one for another, and if any hunger, let him eat at home</HI>; but these make all eating alike, but eating the Lords Supper never was intended for satisfying hunger, the Lord, and his Messengers also, guided by him, makes a plain difference as is evident, between this and common eating, for <HI>Paul</HI> rebuking the <HI>Corinthians</HI> for rash and disorderly acting in this Ordinance, that he had delivered them, according as he had received it from the Lord, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 11. saith, this your way of eating, is not to eat the Lords <HI>Supper,</HI> but your own Supper; the Lords <HI>Supper</HI> being a dif|ferent thing from their own Supper; <HI>for they came together designedly to this eating,</HI> as <HI>Acts</HI> 20. And we are required of the Lord to labour to be unanimously together at this eating, to shew thereby, that though they were many, yet were one bread, and one Body, and in a special manner be put in remembrance of the death of that Christ Jesus, who his own self bear their sins in his own body on the tree of his suffering for them in the flesh, as <HI>Peter</HI> saith, 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 4 1. so together by this outward obedience to the holy command, be inwardly remembred, and by faith refreshed through his flesh, that is meats indeed, and his blood, even that blood of his Cross, by which he made peace and at|tonement

for his Saints; and confirmed the new Covenant of his grace and remission of sins, thereby also being put in remembrance of his se|cond glorious Coming to their Salvation, that wait and look for him; so saith <HI>Paul, so oft as you eat this bread, and drink this Cup of the Lord, you shew forth the Lords death till he come</HI>: not come as the <HI>Quakers</HI> vainly i|magine him to be come to them, which is but a deceitful notion; for it is evident, That the Primitive Saints put in this Gospel Order as hath been proved; had the spiritual baptism, and enjoyment of Christ in Spirit (which these do but meerly boast of, fulfilling that word of <HI>So|lomon, Prov.</HI> 25.14. and (of <HI>Jude</HI> also, <HI>he that boasteth of a false gift is like clouds and wind without rain</HI>) but they had it indeed, being destitute of no gift, waiting for the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 1.7. who saith, <HI>he shall confirm you to the end, that you may be blameless in the day of Christ; which day, the Saints thus gifted from on high, looked for, and hasted to,</HI> 2 Pet. 3.12. and saith <HI>John, truly our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ,</HI> 1 <HI>Epistle</HI> 1.3. yet looking for another coming, according to his Promise, who told them, <HI>that he would see them again af|ter a little while, because he must go to the Father</HI>: and then their hearts should rejoice: <HI>John</HI> saith, <HI>Come Lord Jesus, come quickly.</HI></P>
<P>And indeed herein did the wisdom and love of Christ greatly appear to his Saints, fore-seeing the delusions and deceptions that would arise; and many subtle devises of Satan, to make void, and of none effect his sufferings for them in the flesh, to appoint such remembrances of him, and tokens of his love, to leave with them in the little time of his per|sonal absence, that his Redeemed should not be carried away with empty notions of false Christs that never dyed for them, to redeem them; nor with those voices, that should say, <HI>behold he is in the desart: or behold, he is in the secret Chambers,</HI> agreeing to this late voice of the <HI>Quakers</HI> Do|ctrine, who cry up only a light in the secret Chambers of the heart for the true Christ: but said he, believe them not, no, though they should shew great signs and wonders to confirm their word, for saith Christ, <HI>I</HI> have told you this before, <HI>that being forewarned, you may be fore-armed</HI>; not to wonder at those presumptuous assertions that false Apostles, and deceitful workers transformed as Angels of light should come forth with to deceive, but to look for the coming of the Son of Man, which should
