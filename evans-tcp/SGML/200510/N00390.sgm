<HEAD>AT THE CONVENTION Of the <HI>Governour</HI> and Council, and <HI>Representatives</HI> of the <HI>Massachusets</HI> Colony</HEAD>
<P>IT having pleased the God of Heaven, to multiply still the Tokens of his Holy and Righteous Displeasure against us, not only by the whole Series of his Providences towards us, in the Summer past; but also by the growing Difficulties of a Distressing <HI>Indian</HI> War; in which our Barbarous Enemies, notwithstanding utmost Endea|vours that have been used to leave them inexcusable in their continuing Hostility, are yet invading of us; and now flusht with such success of their Attempts, and increase of their Numbers, as threatens a spread|ing of that unhappy Flame into divers Corners of the Land; unless the God of Armies graciously smile upon the present Expedition against them; Vnto all which uncomfortable circumstances, there is added as yet more Ominous, our own extream unpreparedness for the Mercies of God, by our continuance in those provoking Evils which have drawn Di|vine Judgments upon us; so that our only hopes of Deliverance are in his Soveraign Grace, who when we go on frowardly in the way of our own hearts, can see our ways and heal us.</P>
<P><HI>Upon Consideration whereof, together with the present Circum|stances of the State of</HI> Europe: <HI>It is Ordered, That</HI> Thursday, <HI>the Nineteenth Day of this Instant</HI> September; <HI>be Observed as a Day of Humiliation, with Fasting and Prayer throughout this Colony; And that all Servile Labour be therefore every where on that Day forborn. And it is hereby Recommended unto the Churches, Mi|nisters and People in the several Towns and Villages, that they so|lemnly apply themselves unto the Duties of the Day; humbly im|ploring the Blessing of God upon their most Gracious Majesties, King</HI> William, <HI>and Queen</HI> Mary, <HI>with the whole</HI> English Israel; <HI>and that Gods Presence and Blessing may also be with and upon our For|ces gone and going forth to engage against our Pagan Adversaries. And that he would farther grant those many other both Spiritual and Temporal Blessings, which Tend unto our full Establishment.</HI></P>
