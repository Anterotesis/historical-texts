<P>THE falls of the People of God do darken their &s;incerity: they are as a Cloud covering their uprightne&s;s: they do make their &s;incerity que&s;tionable unto others: &s;ome that take notice of their falls are ready to &s;u&s;pect, and others are ready to deny their &s;incerity; &s;tanders by are apt to impute their falls to their Hypocri&s;y and the reigning power of &s;in; as if they had now proved them&s;elves to be Hypocrites. They are ready to &s;ay of them, as <HI>David</HI> &s;aid of <HI>Doeg, Lo this is the man that made not God his trust.</HI> And their

falls make their &s;incerity que&s;tionable to them|&s;elves: if they have &s;een &s;omething of upright|ne&s;s in them&s;elves before, now they fear, they were mi&s;taken: they think if there had been any Grace, that would have pre&s;erved them from falling: their falls wound their Con&s;ciences and di&s;turb their Peace. They think if God had loved them, he would not have &s;uffered them to fall into &s;uch &s;in: it &s;eems to them to be the fruit of Gods hatred: they are apt to think that their &s;ins have turned away the heart of God from them, and that he cannot delight in them: they think moreover that if they had loved God, they could not have been drawn to &s;in &s;o again&s;t him. Satan is wont to improve their falls unto their di&s;couragement; and rai&s;es &s;uch mi&s;ts, that day is turned into night unto them. Upon this occa&s;ion Chri&s;t puts this que&s;tion to <HI>Peter</HI>: the Di&s;ciples might be un&s;a|tisfyed with him, becau&s;e of his fall; and he might be di&s;&s;atisfyed with him&s;elf: but hereby Chri&s;t is leading of him into the Examination of his own &s;incerity. You may conceive Chri&s;ts meaning thus: <HI>Peter</HI> you have made a Profe&s;|&s;ion many years: but in the time of my affliction, you &s;hamefully denied me, you formerly profe&s;&s;ed that you would dye with me, before you would deny me, but as &s;oon as the Temptation came; you pre&s;ently denyed me: and as if it were not enough to do it once, you did it a &s;econd

<P>In order to the clearing of this, I &s;hall fir&s;t premi&s;e three things.</P>
<P N="1">1. They that walk in a way of holine&s;s are &s;incere: all that walk in a way of obedience are upright. Walking in Gods ways is the Character of a Saint <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 119.1. <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed are the undefiled in <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="page cropped" EXTENT="1 letter">he way, who walk in the law of the Lord.</HI> An holy <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="page cropped" EXTENT="1 letter">ife is a certain &s;ign of a holy heart.

An holy life <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="page cropped" EXTENT="1 word"> more than any Hypocrite can attain unto: he
<PB N="5" REF="000853_0006_0FABA216DE91E5B0">
may counterfeit Holine&s;s and have the image of it; but falls utterly &s;hort of an holy life: an holy life is a life of &s;incerity and flows from a principle of &s;incerity: other principles may make a man live a moral and religious life: Prudence, Pride and &s;lavi&s;h fear may produce much out-ward con|formity, and many inward affections: but only a principle of Grace can inable a man to live an holy life: all that live holily are regenerate men. <HI>Eph.</HI> 2.10. <HI>Created in Chri&s;t Je&s;us unto good works.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. They that walk in a way of unholine&s;s are not &s;incere: they that lead an unholy life are not upright: a principle of Grace will keep a man from ways or &s;in. 1 <HI>Joh.</HI> 3.9. <HI>He that is born of God, doth not commit &s;in, for his &s;eed remaineth in him, and he cannot &s;in, becau&s;e he is born of God</HI>: he has &s;o much fear that he can't live a life of &s;in, he hates &s;in &s;o that he cannot live a life of &s;in: Some that are &s;incere have a le&s;s degree of &s;incerity than others; but the lea&s;t degree of &s;incerity will pre&s;erve a man from an unholy life&punc; <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 18.23. <HI>I was al&s;o upright before him and I kept my &s;elf from mine iniquity.</HI> An unholy life &s;hews the reigning power of &s;in. <HI>Joh.</HI> 8.34. <HI>He that com|mitteth &s;in, is the &s;ervant of &s;in.</HI> They that are &s;erv+ing any Lu&s;t are not &s;erving of the Lord: if men make great preten&s;ions of &s;incerity, yet lead unholy lives, there is no &s;incerity in them: if they have great affections and hopes, yet they have no &s;in+cerity:
<PB N="6" REF="000853_0007_0FABA217AD741FA8">
they profe&s;s one thing and practi&s;e ano|ther. If men &s;erve their Pride or their Coveteou&s;|ne&s;s, or their Voluptuou&s;ne&s;s, they are not &s;incere, they are utterly de&s;titute of a principle of Grace: if they have &s;hews of Grace, yet they are but Hy|pocrites, and will be damned at the la&s;t day. <HI>Luke</HI> 13.27. <HI>Depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. Many men &s;eem to them&s;elves to walk in a way of Holine&s;s, yet don't certainly know that ever they did perform an act of &s;aving grace; though all that make an high profe&s;&s;ion don't &s;eem to them&s;elves to lead an holy life, yet a|bundance of them do: they are con&s;ciencious of all their ways, have many religious affections; mourn for &s;in, rejoyce in Sabbaths, are thank|ful for mercies; are afflicted under the Tokens of Gods Anger, are de&s;irous of the Conver&s;ion of others: it &s;eems to them, that they live in &s;ome degree as Saints of old did: they think they walk holily, yet many of the&s;e per&s;ons don't cer|tainly know that ever they did perform one act of &s;aving grace, &s;everal of them never did per|form one act of &s;aving grace, therefore they can|not know that they have: and &s;ome that have done it, are in the dark about it; they are under doubts and uncertainties about it: the Que&s;tion is, Whether &s;uch per&s;ons can know from their Walk, that they are &s;incere. This the Doctrine does deny, and it may thus be cleared up.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="000853_0008_0FABA21861AB2BD0"><HI>Argument</HI> 1. It is the acting of Grace that makes and &s;hews the Walk to be <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">: it is not the orderline&s;s of mens walk that &s;hews it to be holy; nor the affectionatene&s;s of mens hearts in Religion, that &s;hews their walk to be holy; nor the long continuance of good carriages, nor a good behaviour in a day of temptation; nor a &s;avoury &s;pirit; the&s;e things may all be, yet the walk not be holy: if there be the acting of love, faith and repentance, then the walk is holy: but all that men do is done in hypocri&s;y, if there be not the acting of grace: if there be no grace in their prayers, in their fa&s;tings, in their di&s;cour&s;es; all is in hypocri&s;y: con&s;cienciou&s;ne&s;s don't prove their walk to be &s;incere: the young man in the Go&s;pel was con&s;cientious: Mat. 19.20. <HI>all the&s;e things have I done from my youth.</HI> Zeal don't prove it, a man may be zealous, yet not upright: <HI>Rom.</HI> 10.2. they be the actings of grace that make and &s;hew the walk to be holy; if it be not a life of faith and love, it is not a holy life: Gal. 2.20. <HI>the life that I live in the fle&s;h, I live by the faith of the Son of God</HI>: therefore he that don't know that he has performed an act of grace, can't know that he has an holy walk: he that don't know that he has that which is the life of an holy walk, and e&s;&s;ential to it, can't know that his walk is holy.</P>
<P N="2">2. It is harder to know an holy walk than one act of grace: it is harder for any man to di&s;cern
<PB N="8" REF="000853_0009_0FABA2194D8FFC20">
that he leads an holy life, then that he performs a gracious act: for an holy life does con&s;i&s;t of ma|ny gracious actions; and it is harder to di&s;cern that a man has done many, then that he has done one: it is harder to find out many profitable herbs in the field than one; harder to di&s;cern many grains of Wheat among the Chaff, than one&punc; it is harder to find many Evidences of a good E|&s;tate than one; to the di&s;cerning of many acts of grace, there is required more ob&s;ervation and ex|amination, then to the di&s;cerning of one act of grace; if it be difficult to find one, it will be more difficult to find two, ten, an hundred: there|fore he that don't know that he has performed one act of grace, does not know that he leads an holy life. I may allude to that, Jer. 12.5. <HI>if thou ha&s;t run with the footmen and they have wearied thee, how wilt thou contend with hor&s;es.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. If the holine&s;s of mens actions can't be di&s;|cerned &s;everally, it can't be di&s;cerned in conjuncti|on: if a man looks upon his actions &s;everally, and cannot &s;ay that this or that or any one was an holy action; he cannot &s;ay concerning any acti|on, that it was an act of &s;aving &s;aith, or &s;aving love; how can he when he looks upon his carria|ges together, &s;ay they are holy, if there be no one action that he can &s;ay is &s;incere; how can he &s;ay that his walk is &s;incere: if a man &s;ees an heap of corn, how can he &s;ay, it is an heap of wheat, when he does not know, that there is one grain
<PB N="9" REF="000853_0010_0FABA21A08FF96C0">
of wheat there: the &s;incerity of his walk depends upon the &s;incerity of particular actions; and if that be hidden from him, how can he &s;ay his walk is &s;incere: if for ought he knows every pray|er and duty be done in hypocri&s;y; then for ought he knows, his whole life is a life of hypocri&s;y&punc; if he can in&s;tance in no action that is certainly otherwi&s;e, it may be &s;o for ought that he knows; if he can't an&s;wer to this que&s;tion. <HI>Joh.</HI> 21.17. <HI>Love&s;t thou me</HI>? or to that, <HI>Joh&punc;</HI> 9.35. <HI>do&s;t thou believe on the Son of God</HI>? or &s;ome &s;uch like; he cannot tell that he lives an holy life&punc; therefore &s;uch a man can't prove his &s;incerity from his walk. No walk can be evidential, but what is made up of acts of grace; therefore if he &s;ees none, he can have no evidence from his walk.</P>
<P N="4">4. If there be no act of grace, there is no &s;in|cerity; therefore if he &s;ees no act of grace, he &s;ees no &s;incerity; when there is no act of grace, there is no principle of grace: though a man walk in print, yet there is no &s;incerity; many carry them&s;elves very fairly, but if there be no grace, there is no uprightne&s;s in them, <HI>Joh.</HI> 5.42. <HI>I know you, that you have not the love of God in you</HI>; it is all counterfeit walk: they are like men upon the Stage, that per&s;onate other kind of men; &s;o the&s;e men walk like Saints, and talk like Saints; but if there be no act of grace, they are no Saints, they want that which does con&s;titute a Saint; therefore if a man do not know any act of grace
<PB N="10" REF="000853_0011_0FABA21AB96004D0">
in him&s;elf, he can't know him&s;elf to be a Saint, though he walk like an Angel.</P>
<P N="5">5. The multiplication of &s;uch acts as are com|mon to Saints and hypocrites, don't &s;hew him to be &s;incere; prayer is common to Saints and hypo|crites. <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 78.34. <HI>When he &s;lew them, then they &s;ought him, they returned and enquired early after God</HI>; therefore if a man do this a thou&s;and times, it don't prove him to be a Saint; &s;o morality is com|mon to Saints and hypocrites. <HI>Mat.</HI> 19.20. and if a man carries morally, twenty years together, it don't &s;hew him to be a Saint; &s;o zeal, &s;o delight in Sabbaths; if an hypocrite may do the&s;e things, then the multiplication of them, and walking in &s;uch a way is no evidence; that which is com|mon, let it be multiplied never &s;o often, don't be|come &s;aving: multiply cyphers, and they make no number: therefore there can be no evidence of a good e&s;tate from a mans walk, unle&s;s he knew &s;ome act of grace; if he can't di&s;cern &s;ome act of &s;aving grace, he mu&s;t be at a lo&s;s about his &s;incerity.</P>

<P>See the rea&s;on why many Profe&s;&s;ors are un&s;a|tisfied about their &s;incerity; though they have a pretty good conver&s;ation, are con&s;cientious, affe|ctionate, zealous yet they are full of fears, they are often perplexed, and don't know what to

make of them&s;elves; it &s;eems to them that their walk is pretty much according to rule, but they do not know that ever they did perform any act of &s;aving grace; they can't an&s;wer to &s;uch que|&s;tions, <HI>Love&s;t thou me?</HI> Joh. 21.17. <HI>Or do&s;t thou believe on the Son of God?</HI> Joh. 9.25. this does create a deal of perplexity to them; and they are afraid what will become of them&s;elves, after all their profe&s;&s;ion. And there are three &s;orts of them.</P>
<P N="1">1. Some Profe&s;&s;ors never did &s;ee any act of grace in them&s;elves; they never had any: and therefore could not &s;ee any: they have had affe|ction, but no love; &s;orrow, but not godly &s;orrow, encouragement, but no faith. There be many Profe&s;&s;ors that are utterly de&s;titute of gracious car|riages, they have the re&s;emblance of them, but they never had any exerci&s;e of grace; they are <HI>&s;piritually dead,</HI> and never did perform any act of <HI>&s;piritual life</HI>; thus it was with <HI>Saul, Doeg, Achito|phel, Judas</HI> and <HI>Demas,</HI> they were only the pictures of Saints, and imitated the actions of Spiritual Life, but did not perform them; <HI>an evil tree can't bring forth good fruit, men can't gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thi&s;tles:</HI> Mat. 7.16, 18&punc; they can't &s;ee acts of grace: men cannot &s;ee that which is not.</P>
<P N="2">2: Some Profe&s;&s;ors never did certainly know that they have performed any act of &s;aving grace, they have di&s;covered the workings of grace &s;ome|times
<PB N="12" REF="000853_0013_0FABA21C21A01FB0">
in them&s;elves, but not &s;o plainly, as to be able to &s;peak roundly up to it, as <HI>Peter</HI> did, <HI>Lord, thou knowe&s;t all things; thou knowe&s;t that I love thee?</HI> Joh. 21.17. they under&s;tand that there is a great deal that does re&s;emble grace, that is not grace; and &s;o they doubt whether it be of the right kind: they know that there is a temporary faith, <HI>Luk.</HI> 8.13. <HI>&s;ome believe for a time, and then fall away</HI>; and there may be &s;trong de&s;ires and delight, where there is no &s;incere love; here may be great pangs of affection, without any up|rightne&s;s, and the acts of grace were not &s;o clear, as &s;ome others do &s;peak of, hence they are not fully &s;atisfied; as when one &s;ees a man at a great di&s;tance, he is at &s;ome lo&s;s whether it be a man.</P>
<P N="3">3. Some have certainly &s;een the workings of grace, but through temptations &s;ince, they have lo&s;t the certainty of that knowledge; at the time they knew they did believe in Chri&s;t, and that they loved God, and could &s;ay as <HI>David,</HI> P&s;alm 116.1. <HI>I love the Lord</HI>; and as, P&s;al. 46.1. <HI>The Lord is my &s;trength and refuge:</HI> but afterwards they have not &s;o full and clear a remembrance of it: and God brings them into affliction, and unbelief prevails, and now they are &s;u&s;picious that they were mi&s;taken; be&s;ides, God don't hear their prayers, they have &s;ought him many a time for &s;uch &amp; &s;uch a mercy, and he has denied them at la&s;t: be&s;ides, they find a dead heart, corrup|tion &s;trong, and have had no &s;uch plain working

<P>Others cannot be certain of a mans &s;incerity from his Conver&s;ation: if <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" EXTENT="1 letter">thers &s;ee men carry well, they pre&s;ently &s;ay, they are good men: but they don't know it from thence; there is indeed ground enough for Charity; but not for A&s;&s;urance: for whatever mens Conver&s;ation be, if they don't &s;ee the actings of Grace, they can|not be a&s;&s;ured that the man is a Godly man. It is not good to depend upon the judgment of others, for they do not know, whether a man be &s;incere or not.

Men cannot by words or actions make the actings of grace &s;o vi&s;ible to others, that they can di&s;tingui&s;h them: if a man talk gra|ciou&s;ly and walk graciou&s;ly, he can't make another certain that he does &s;o: another that &s;ees the external action, can't certainly di&s;tin|gui&s;h it from a formal action; if he &s;ati&s;fy a|nother, yet he can't a&s;&s;ure another, that it is a gracious action: a man may &s;peak like an Angel, yet not have charity; <HI>he may give all his goods to feed the poor, and his body to be bur|ned, and yet not have charity,</HI> 1 Cor. 3.1, 2, 13.</P>

<P><HI>Of Warning,</HI> That you be not confident of your &s;incerity from your walk, without the certain knowledge that you have performed any act of &s;aving grace: &s;ome men will be confident that they are in a good e&s;tate, though they do not know that ever they be|lieved in Chri&s;t, or have exerci&s;ed any true love to God: all that they have to &s;ay for
<PB N="15" REF="000853_0016_0FABA22E8635C860">
them&s;elves is, that they have a con&s;ciencious care to do their duty, and are many times affected in a religious way, and hope, they do tru&s;t in Chri&s;t and make the glory of God their end; and they find affection to the people of God: but this you may be &s;ure of, you can't conclude your &s;incerity from your walk, unle&s;s you know that you have performed &s;ome act or acts of &s;aving grace: if you do know that, then you have rea&s;on to con|clude your walk to be holy: where there is one act of &s;aving grace, there will be more: there is the principle, but without this you cannot con|clude it.</P>
<P><HI>Con&s;ider</HI> 1. If you be &s;incere, this confidence is meer flattery; good men &s;ometimes think they are good upon &s;uch foundations as will not hold: as becau&s;e God does the things that they have prayed for; becau&s;e he &s;miles upon them in his Providence; becau&s;e others think they are Saints: &s;o this is one way of flattery: if you be up|right, yet you can't tell it from your walk, if you do not know that you exerci&s;e grace: for ought any thing that you know, your life is a life of hypocri&s;y: men may do all that you know you do, and yet be hypocrites; your walk can't be evidential to you, if you do not &s;ee the acts of grace, your confidence is pre&s;umption; men mu&s;t go upon a &s;ure bottom, 2 Cor. 13.5. <HI>Examine your &s;elves, prove your own &s;elves</HI>; &amp; this flattering &amp;

<P N="2">2. If you be not &s;incere, it may prove your ruine; &s;ome men that take notice of their con|&s;cientiou&s;ne&s;s do conclude them&s;elves godly, when they are ungodly: and fall &s;hort of a prin|ciple of grace: they are de&s;titute of faith and love, Joh 5.42. <HI>I know you, that you have not the love of God in you:</HI> but becau&s;e they imagine that they are &s;incere, they re&s;t in their pre&s;ent attain|ments, Joh. 9.41. <HI>becau&s;e you &s;ay we &s;ee, therefore your &s;in remaineth:</HI> when they are &s;tirred up to get &s;incerity, they hope they have it already, they hope others will take the warning, and that their children will hearken, but they think them&s;elves are out of danger: coun&s;els and warnings are lo&s;t upon them, they ble&s;s them&s;elves in their pre&s;ent e&s;tate, they think their di&s;ea&s;e is cured, and &s;o give over the u&s;e of means; they think they are provided for Eternity, and &s;o they are at re&s;t: they are under &s;ome endeavours to get more knowledge and more grace, but not to be Converted: hence this work is neglected; when once they have taken up &s;uch a conceit that they are godly, they have got their deaths wound, if mercy do not prevent: they live carele&s;ly, and when they come to dye, they will be &s;hut out of

<P><HI>Of Direction</HI>: To Saints how to get the know|ledge of your &s;incerity; by getting &s;uch vi&s;ible actings of grace, that you may know them cer|tainly to be the acts of &s;aving grace: it is a great exerci&s;e to &s;ome Saints, whether they be &s;incere Saints, they labour in it for many years; and one Mini&s;ter gives &s;igns, and they try them&s;elves by them, and another gives &s;igns, and they try them &s;elves by them; and &s;ometimes they think they &s;ee the &s;igns of Saints, and &s;ometimes the &s;ign of hypocrites: and they don't know what to make of them&s;elves: the be&s;t way is to get &s;uch exerci&s;e of grace, that you may know it to b<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="page cropped" EXTENT="1 letter"> grace; don't let grace lie in a withering conditi+on: let it flouri&s;h, that it may act vi&s;ibly; tha<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="page cropped" EXTENT="1 letter"> you may certainly know it: your walk withou<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="page cropped" EXTENT="1 letter"> this, will never clear up your good condition.</P>
<P><HI>Con&s;ider.</HI> 1. There is good u&s;e of &s;ign provided they be true &s;igns warranted by
<PB N="18" REF="000853_0019_0FABA2311AE05F00">
right interpretation of the Scripture; though many &s;igns that men give are very fallible: but if the &s;igns be good, there is very good u&s;e to be made of them; though a man may ask &s;igns of &s;igns endle&s;sly; yet they are of good advantage to beget a probable knowledge of a mans good e&s;tate; many per&s;ons are in|couraged and &s;upported by them. 1 <HI>Joh.</HI> 3.14. <HI>Hereby we know that we are pa&s;&s;ed from death to life, becau&s;e we love the brethren</HI>: and they are a further confirmation to tho&s;e that have had A&s;&s;urances of their &s;incerity: when they find Scripture &s;igns falling in with tho&s;e evi|dences, which they have formerly received, they are further e&s;tabli&s;hed thereby.</P>
<P N="2">2. But the vi&s;ible actings of Grace will &s;atisfy all &s;orts of Chri&s;tians. We may di&s;tin|gui&s;h Chri&s;tians into two &s;orts; &s;ome are per&s;ons of great under&s;tanding and knowledge, they have a deep in&s;ight into tho&s;e ways of deceit and hypocri&s;y that the heart is &s;ubject to: and they are apt to be puzled with que&s;tions and doubts, that fly over the heads of others; they are afraid of &s;uch deceits as other men don't &s;u&s;pect: but when they have plain vi&s;ible workings of Grace, that they know to be Grace, this fully &s;atisfyes them: <HI>Thou knowe&s;t that I love thee.</HI> Joh. 21.17. Others are weak and ig|norant and can't give many &s;igns of true Grace,
<PB N="19" REF="000853_0020_0FABA23CF2219670">
nor di&s;tinctly take them up, when they are laid down: yet when they plainly &s;ee the vi|&s;ible actings of &s;aving Grace, the thing is put beyond que&s;tion. A weak woman is as well &s;atisfyed that &s;he loves her child as the wi&s;e&s;t man in the land, though &s;he can't make a large di&s;cour&s;e upon it, nor prove it by infallible &s;igns, becau&s;e &s;he feels her love: &s;o it is in this ca&s;e.</P>
<P N="3">3. Though the vi&s;ible actings of Grace may be counterfeited, yet they that have them, may know that they have them. There is nothing but may be counterfeited, men may counterfeit them&s;elves to be great men and holy men: Gold and Silver, and Jewels may be counterfeited. So the&s;e vi&s;ible actings of Grace; men may have very &s;trong affections; where there is no love or godly &s;orrow. <HI>Matt.</HI> 8.19. <HI>Ma&s;ter I will follow thee whither &s;oever thou goest.</HI> 1 Sam. 24.16. <HI>Saul lift up his voice and wept.</HI> Men may &s;ay Ho&s;anna to day, and Crucify to morrow. Yet tho&s;e that have the vi&s;ible actings of Grace know it. He that dreams thinks he is awake, but he that is awake, knows he is awake: though there be counterfeits, yet the vi&s;ible actings may be known at the time.</P>
<P N="4">4. If men have &s;uch vi&s;ible actings of Grace but now and then, they will be of great u&s;e to them as long as they live: though they
<PB N="20" REF="000853_0021_0FABA23E60CEB650">
may be after that Expo&s;ed to great Tempta|tions, yet the&s;e actings of Grace that they have &s;een, will be a &s;tay to them: they will work an abiding hope in the heart; they will often have occa&s;ion to call to mind the years of the right hand of the mo&s;t high, and their Song in the night. If a man &s;hould live many years after, he will not forget this. <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 63.2. <HI>That I may &s;ee thy power and glory, &s;o as I have &s;een thee in the Sanctuary.</HI> If he has great Tempta|tions from deadne&s;s and from Gods with draw|ings; this will come to mind, and &s;o he will have hope&punc; and the more &s;uch acts are re|peated, the more advantage he is under to have a &s;ettled A&s;&s;urance of his &s;incerity.</P>
