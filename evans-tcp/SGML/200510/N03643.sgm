<P>_THOUGH I know no Rea&s;on why you &s;hould be &s;olicitous about any Thing that happens to &s;uch a worth|le&s;s Creature as I am, yet as your Love (Oh unmerited Kindne&s;s!) abounds ex|ceedingly towards me, and I am po&s;itive you will give Thanks unto our good GOD, for all the Mercies he has confer'd upon me; I have &s;ent you as full and particular an Account of the Remainder of my Voyage, as the little Lei&s;ure I have had from my Mini&s;terial Offices would permit me to give.</P>
<P><HI>Monday, February</HI> 20, 1737. Spent the Morning on Board, in writing Letters to my dear Friends in <HI>England,</HI> to acquaint them of my &s;afe Arrival. Went in the Afternoon on &s;hore to <HI>Gibraltar,</HI> and was un&s;peakably delighted with the Pro&s;pect of t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e Place. My Friend <HI>H.</HI> and I, din'd at an Inn, and went afterwards
<PB N="4" REF="004453_0004_100D9E6018C9EAB0">
with Capt. <HI>W.</HI> and &s;ome other Company, to view one Side of the Fort; which to us &s;eem'd impregnable, and at the Sight of which I could &s;carce avoid crying out, &mdash; <HI>Who is &s;o great a</HI> GOD, <HI>as our</HI> GOD!</P>
<P>The &s;eeing Per&s;ons of all Nations and Lan|guages, gave me great Plea&s;ure, and the Diffe|rence of the Value of their Money and ours, gave me Occa&s;ion to reflect on the Stupidity of tho&s;e, who place their Happine&s;s in that which has no intrin&s;ick Worth in it&s;elf, but only &s;o much as we arbitrarily put upon it.</P>
<P>Went into a <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> Chappel; wherein were the Relicks of a va&s;t deal of Pageantry, and &s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">veral Images of the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> dre&s;s'd up not like a poor <HI>Galilean,</HI> but in her Silks and Damasks. <HI>O,</HI> thought I, <HI>who has bewitch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> this People, that they &s;hould thus depart from th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Simplicity of</HI> CHRIST, <HI>and go a Whoring after their own Inventions!

<P><HI>Tue&s;day, Feb.</HI> 21. After having read Prayers and wrote &s;ome religious Letters, to my Friends in <HI>England,</HI> went again to <HI>Gibraltar,</HI> to pay my Re&s;pects to Governor <HI>S.</HI> being told by Capt. <HI>M.</HI> that he expected to &s;ee me. &mdash; The worthy old Gentleman received me with the utmo&s;t Candour, and gave me a general Invitation to come and dine with him every Day, during my Stay at <HI>Gibraltar.</HI> I thanked him for his Kindne&s;s, had

Went on Board about Five. Read Prayers, and began expounding the Creed, in the Cabin. Wrote &s;ome more religious Letters, and went to Bed very thankful to GOD, for &s;ending me abroad.</P>
<P><HI>Wedne&s;day, Feb.</HI> 22. This Day I intended to &s;tay on Board to write Letters; but GOD being plea&s;ed to &s;hew me, it was not his Will, I went on Shore again, and paid both the Mini&s;ters of <HI>Gibraltar</HI> a Vi&s;it; who received me very af|fectionately, and offer'd me the U&s;e of the Pulpit. <HI>O, what a ble&s;&s;ed Thing is it for the Clergy to dwell together in Unity!</HI></P>
<P>At Eleven, went to public Prayers; and was much plea&s;ed to &s;ee many Officers and Soldiers attend the General to Church. <HI>Methinks Religion looks doubly amiable in Soldiers!</HI> After Prayers, din'd again with the General; who gave me an Invitation, as I went out of the Church. He treated me with uncommon Civility, and de&s;ired me to preach the following. <HI>Sunday,</HI> which I promi&s;ed to do. We had an elegant Entertain|ment, but my Thoughts were mo&s;tly employ'd in pitying the Unhappine&s;s of great Men, who
<PB N="6" REF="004453_0006_100D9E64282EF8D8">
are in &s;uch continual Danger of having their Table become a Snare unto them. I had an Opportunity of &s;ending a Packet of Letters, with my Journal, to my dear Friends in <HI>England; May the good Lord give them his Ble&s;&s;ing!</HI></P>
<P>Went in the Afternoon to vi&s;it a De&s;erter, who had &s;ent me a Letter, de&s;iring me to inter|cede for him with the Governour, he being apprehen&s;ive he &s;hould die for De&s;ertion, I intended to an&s;wer his Reque&s;t, but the Gover|nor was &s;o merciful, that he order'd him to be whipp'd only, which I thought Puni&s;hment little enough. <HI>O Sin! What Mi&s;chief do&s;t thou make in the World!</HI></P>
<P>In the Evening, I return'd as u&s;ual on Board. Read Prayers, and expounded in the great Cabin. Buried a Child; made an Exhortation to the Soldiers, proper for the Occa&s;ion. Wrote to &s;ome Friends at <HI>Deal,</HI> and went to Bed, with unu&s;ual Thoughts, and Convictions, that GOD would do &s;ome great Things at <HI>Gibraltar. O that I was a pure Ve&s;&s;el, fit for my Ma&s;ter's U&s;e!</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thur&s;day, Feb.</HI> 23. Continued all this Day on Board; did my u&s;ual Duty in the Ship; and put my dear Friend <HI>B</HI>&mdash;'s Sermon into the Hands of two Officers at <HI>Gibraltar,</HI> who came to dine on Board with Lieutenant <HI>D.</HI> They behaved very much like Gentlemen, and &s;eemed plea&s;ed with &s;erious Conver&s;ation. <HI>May the</HI> GOD <HI>whom I &s;erve, add the</HI> Chri&s;tian <HI>to the</HI> Gentleman!</P>
<P><HI>Friday, Feb.</HI> 24. <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed be God, who this Day has &s;hewn me, that he has heard my Prayer,
<PB N="7" REF="004453_0007_100D9E664192C560">
and not taken his Loving Kindne&s;s from me!</HI> &mdash; Before I reached <HI>Gibraltar,</HI> I prayed that God would open an effectual Door, at the Place whi|ther we were going, and direct me where I &s;hould lodge; and lo! this Day he hath an|&s;wered me! About Ten in the Morning Capt. <HI>M.</HI> came on Board, telling me that one Major <HI>S.</HI> a Per&s;on I never &s;aw, had provided me a con|venient Lodging, at one Merchant <HI>B</HI>&mdash;'s, and de&s;ired that I would come on Shore. I looking on this as a Call from Providence, received it with all Thankfulne&s;s, and went with Friend <HI>H.</HI> on Shore; but not without fir&s;t praying GOD would direct us how to behave.</P>
<P>About the middle of the Town Major <HI>S.</HI> gave us the Meeting; conducted us to our new Lodgings, which were very commodious, and engaged us to dine with him, and Capt. <HI>M. When I &s;ent you without Scrip, or Shoe, lacked ye any Thing? they &s;aid unto Him, Nothing, Lord.</HI></P>
<P>About Eleven was introduc'd by Dr. <HI>C.</HI> to General <HI>C.</HI> who was very de&s;irous of &s;eeing me: He receiv'd me exceeding kindly; and after a little &s;erious Conver&s;ation, we went to Governor <HI>S</HI>&mdash;'s, and from thence to public Prayers; and was highly pleas'd to &s;ee &s;o many Officers at|tending on the Generals to Church. Dr. <HI>C.</HI> told me, he had not known Governor <HI>S.</HI> ab&s;ent him|&s;elf from Prayers once the&s;e &s;even Years; except when he was hinder'd by real Sickne&s;s. <HI>O that all others would let their Light &s;o &s;hine before Men!</HI></P>
<P>Retir'd in the Evening to our Lodgings. Had Family Prayer. Wrote &s;ome few Religious
<PB N="8" REF="004453_0008_100D9E681FD5D378">
Letters. Spent near half an Hour in &s;erious Conver&s;ation with the People of the Hou&s;e. Gave Thanks for the Ble&s;&s;ings of the Day, and was &s;oon convinc'd that God had &s;ent me hither of a Truth. <HI>Be careful for nothing; but in every,&mdash;even the minute&s;t Thing, make your Wants known unto God; &mdash; for he careth for you.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Saturday, Feb.</HI> 25. About Six this Morning went with <HI>H.</HI> to the Church, to pray with &s;ome devout Soldiers, who I heard u&s;ed to meet there at that Time, and with whom my Soul was knit immediately.&mdash; <HI>For all my Delight is in the Saints that are in the Earth, and in tho&s;e that excel in Virtue.</HI></P>
<P>After we had fini&s;h'd our Devotions, I made Inquiry into their State; and found that their Society had been &s;ub&s;i&s;ting about twelve Years; and that one Sergeant <HI>B.</HI> (a devout Soldier in|deed) now among them, was the fir&s;t Beginner of it. At fir&s;t (they told me) they u&s;ed to meet in Dens, and Mountains, and Caves in the Rocks; but afterwards, on their applying for Leave to build a little Place to retire in, Dr. <HI>C.</HI> and Governor <HI>S.</HI> gave them the free U&s;e of the Church, where they con&s;tantly meet three times in a Day; and pray, read, and &s;ing P&s;alms; and at any other Sea&s;on when they plea&s;e. &mdash; They have met with much Contempt; and are now in Deri&s;ion, call'd, THE NEW LIGHTS; and glorious Lights they are indeed! For I convers'd clo&s;ely with &s;everal of them, and they made me quite a&s;ham'd of my little Proficiency in the School of Chri&s;t. Many have join'd with
<PB N="9" REF="004453_0009_100D9E6ACC10E1E8">
them for a Time, but a &s;ervile Fear of Man (that Bane of Chri&s;tianity!) made them draw back. However, &s;ome continued &s;tedfa&s;t and unmoveable, and tho' de&s;pi&s;ed by the World, are, no Doubt, highly favour'd of GOD. Go|vernor <HI>S.</HI> countenances them much; and has &s;poke of them often to me with much Re&s;pect. <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed be</HI> GOD, <HI>even the Father of our Lord</HI> JESUS CHRIST, <HI>who hath not left him&s;elf without Witne&s;s at any Place; but hath &s;ome every-where who &s;erve him, and work Righteou&s;ne&s;s!</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Sunday</HI> before we came hither, I was telling my Friend <HI>H.</HI> that I had Rea&s;on to think, by what had happen'd to me, that GOD had &s;ome Work for me to do at <HI>Gibraltar.</HI> He an&s;wer'd, there could not be much Good expected from among Soldiers. &mdash; I reply'd, No Doubt but God has &s;ome &s;ecret ones in all Places, who tremble at his Word. <HI>And, lo! he has this Day brought me to them. By this I know thou favoure&s;t me, O Lord, Thou King of Saints!</HI></P>
<P>There is al&s;o another Society of the <HI>Scotch</HI> Church, who in Contempt are called DARK LANTHORNS: It has &s;ub&s;i&s;ted about a Year, and is made up of many &s;erious Chri&s;tians, as I was inform'd. I did not think it proper to vi&s;it them; but I &s;ent to them, as well as to the other Society, &s;ome proper Books. Had Religious Talk with &s;everal of them, and endeavour'd to unite both Societies together. <HI>O when will that Time come, when all Differences about Externals &s;hall be taken away, and we all with one Heart, and one Mouth, glorify our Lord</HI> JESUS CHRIST?</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="004453_0010_100D9E6E2E4E37B0">About Eight, return'd to my Lodgings; and after having wrote &s;ome Religious Letters, went on Board the <HI>Amy</HI> (having fir&s;t advi&s;ed with Col. <HI>C.</HI>) to marry a Couple, who &s;ent to me Ye&s;terday, to come and celebrate their Nuptials. I took that Opportunity of exhorting them all to <HI>take Heed to the Things that belong to their Peace.</HI> Some, I believe, were affected; but the Gene|rality of them behav'd &s;o carele&s;s, that I could not &s;ee a Difference between tho&s;e that have a Mini&s;ter among them, and tho&s;e that have not.</P>
<P>About Twelve, went on Board my own Ship&punc; Din'd. Did &s;ome nece&s;&s;ary Bu&s;ine&s;s. Read Prayers. Gave my Flo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">k a warm Exhortation, and return'd about Five on Shore; where I &s;pent near two Hours with the Devout Soldiers in the Church. Many of them convers'd mo&s;t Spiritually; and &s;eem'd well acquainted with the Pangs of the New-Birth. <HI>May God perfect the good Work begun in their Hearts! O how amiable are thy Servants, O Lord of Ho&s;ts! How would the World admire them, did they &s;ee their Beauties! But Satan does now, as formerly,&mdash; dre&s;s them up in Bear-skins, in order to have them baited.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sunday, Feb.</HI> 26. Between Five and Six in the Morning, went with Mr. <HI>H.</HI> and (which I did all the while I was at <HI>Gibraltar</HI>) &s;ung P&s;alms; pray'd, and expounded the Le&s;&s;ons to the devout Soldiers in the Church, and was much inlarged. <HI>Thanks be given unto Thee, O Lord!</HI></P>
<P>Intended to go and preach to my People. Was prevented by the Violence of the Wind; but
<PB N="11" REF="004453_0011_100D9E6FC18ECDC0">
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> pleas'd to hear of &s;ome <HI>Gibraltar</HI> Officers, who din'd that Day on Board the <HI>Whitaker,</HI> that &s;ome of my Flock had the Courage to read Prayers, and &s;ing P&s;alms them&s;elves; and, as I found afterwards, continued to do &s;o, during my Ab&s;ence from them. <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed be God! I hope I &s;hall have &s;ome that dare to be &s;ingularly good, and will not be kept out by the Pre&s;s!</HI></P>
<P>Preach'd in the Morning at <HI>Gibraltar,</HI> before &s;uch a Congregation of Officers and Soldiers, as I never before &s;aw. The Church, tho' very large, was quite throng'd; and GOD was plea|&s;ed to &s;hew me, that he had given extraordinary Succe&s;s to my Sermon. <HI>O how is the Divine Strength magnify'd in my Weakne&s;s! O God! why do&s;t thou chu&s;e to work by &s;o unfit an In&s;tru|ment! O grant I may, like a pure Cry&s;tal, tran|&s;mit all the Light thou poure&s;t on me, and never claim as my own, what is thy &s;ole Property!</HI></P>
<P>Din'd, with Friend <HI>H.</HI> at Governor <HI>S</HI>&mdash;'s, who &s;ent mo&s;t kindly to invite us. The Law at his Table, was the &s;ame with that of <HI>Aha&s;uerus.</HI> No one was compell'd; and all the Officers be|hav'd in &s;uch a decent, innocent manner, every Time I din'd there, that they &s;urpriz'd me. <HI>Surely &s;ome Fear of God is in this Place!</HI></P>
<P>After Evening Prayers, (for there are none in the Afternoon) I went and expounded, pray'd, and &s;ung P&s;alms with the Society, and had near thirty Hearers. <HI>May the Good Lord give it his Ble&s;&s;ing!</HI></P>
<P>At Night had &s;ome devout Conver&s;ation with my Ho&s;t and Ho&s;te&s;s; who &s;eem to love me as their own Son. Pray'd for ab&s;ent
<PB N="12" REF="004453_0012_100D9E715400D1B0">
Friends; and went to Bed, a&s;ham'd I had done &s;o little for GOD, on the Sabbath Day. <HI>But when we can't do as we would, we mu&s;t do as we can.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Monday, February</HI> 27. Went to the Society, and did as Ye&s;terday; and was vi&s;ited after|wards by two of the <HI>Nonconforming</HI> Society, who &s;eem'd to be <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> indeed. I exhorted them to Love and Unity, and not to let a little Difference about a few Externals occa&s;ion any Narrow-Spiritedne&s;s to ari&s;e in their Hearts. I advi&s;ed them to come and hear me expound in the Church, which they did; and providentially the Le&s;&s;on was the 4th of the <HI>Ephe&s;ians</HI>; from whence I took Occa&s;ion to urge on them, the Nece&s;&s;ity of loving one another, with a catho|lic, di&s;intere&s;ted Love; to be of one Heart, and of one Mind, and to join, without having Re|&s;pect to Per&s;ons, in ha&s;tening the Kingdom of our Lord JESUS CHRIST. I hope GOD gave a Ble&s;&s;ing to what was &s;aid; for I ob&s;erv'd they came con&s;tantly afterwards; and I was told, there was a perfect Harmony between them. <HI>What infinite Mi&s;chief have needle&s;s Divi&s;ions occa&s;ion'd in the Chri&s;tian World!</HI> DIVIDE ET IMPERA, <HI>is the Devil's Motto.</HI></P>

expound. Afterwards we breakfa&s;ted with a Gentlewoman, who &s;ent by Major <HI>S.</HI> to invite us, and mo&s;t gladly received us, into her Hou&s;e. About Ten, I preach'd my Sermon again&s;t Swearing, and made a Farewel Application to the Soldiers that were going over to <HI>Georgia,</HI> out of that Garri&s;on. The Governor had that Morning review'd them. I de&s;ired they might be order'd to come to Church, that I might have an Opportunity of telling them how to behave, in that Land, which they were going over the Sea to protect. The Colonel and Governor mo&s;t readily con&s;ented, and there was a mo&s;t thronged Audience. GOD was plea&s;ed to &s;et his Seal to my Sermon. Many Officers and Soldiers wept &s;orely; and a vi&s;ible Alteration was ob&s;erv'd in the Garri&s;on, for &s;ome Days afterward. <HI>O that their Convictions may end in their Conver&s;ion, and that they may bring forth the Fruits of the Spirit!</HI></P>
<P>Bought &s;ome Wine&punc; with the Money I had collected for the U&s;e of the &s;ick Poor in <HI>Georgia. The Par&s;onage Hou&s;e ought to be &mdash; the Poor's Storehou&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>Had above five hundred to hear me expound this Evening; and went up into the Desk, with the Advice of Dr. <HI>C.</HI> who now con&s;tantly makes one of my Hearers. After this we &s;upp'd at Mr. <HI>B</HI>&mdash;'s, and return'd Home with Joy and great Gladne&s;s of Heart. <HI>Who can expre&s;s the loving Kindne&s;s of the Lord, or &s;hew forth all his Prai&s;e!</HI></P>
<P><HI>Saturday, March</HI> 4. Expounded in the Morning; more Hearers than ever, &s;ome of

which wept. &mdash; Din'd and Supp'd at General <HI>C</HI>&mdash;'s, who &s;ent la&s;t Night to invite me and my Friend; treated us with particular Re&s;pect.</P>
<P>I went in the Afternoon to the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Syna|gogue, and was &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee one of the Head of them come from the further End, and put me into one of their chief Seats. But afterwards he told me, he had heard my Sermon ye&s;terday again&s;t Swearing, and thank'd me for it. <HI>Not unto me, not unto me, O Lord! but unto thy Name, be all the Thanks and Glory.</HI></P>
<P>I continued with them their whole Service; and &s;pent mo&s;t of my Time in &s;ecret Prayer to GOD, <HI>that the Veil might be taken from their Hearts; and that ble&s;&s;ed Time might come, when his cho&s;en People &s;hould again be ingrafted into their own Olive-tree, and all</HI> I&s;rael <HI>be &s;aved!</HI></P>
<P>Vi&s;ited an unhappy Man in Pri&s;on; who la&s;t Night, in a drunken Fit, murder'd a Fellow Soldier. I providentially met him ju&s;t as he was apprehended, and laid before him the Terrors of the Lord. At fir&s;t he &s;eem'd unconcern'd; but in a &s;hort Time he was pricked to the Heart; de&s;ired me to come and &s;ee him, and to-day trembled, and wept bitterly. O <HI>Drun|kenne&s;s! what Mi&s;chief ha&s;t thou done! Thy Name is Legion; for, behold! a Troop of Sins cometh along with thee.</HI></P>
<P>In the Evening, I had near, if not more than a thou&s;and Hearers; and I took Occa&s;ion from the poor Man's Wickedne&s;s and Misfortune, to warn the Soldiery, not to be drunk with <HI>Wine, wherein is Exce&s;s. A Sin that ea&s;ily be&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ts the

<P>I had a great Hoar&s;ene&s;s upon me, but not|with&s;tanding, GOD enabled me to &s;peak with Power. <HI>When we are weak, then are we &s;trong!

<P><HI>Sunday, March</HI> 5. After Morning Expo&s;ition in the Church, went and &s;aw the <HI>Roman</HI> Catholics at High Ma&s;s; and &s;hall only make this Remark; &mdash;<HI>That there needs no other Argument again&s;t Po|pery, than to &s;ee the Pageantry, Super&s;tition, and Idolatry of their Wor&s;hip.</HI></P>
<P>About Ten, went to the Church belonging to the Gari&s;on. Preach'd to a mo&s;t throng'd Audience, and received what my Soul long'd after,&mdash; the Sacrament of CHRIST'S mo&s;t ble&s;&s;ed Body and Blood. Both the Generals were there, and near fifty more Communicants. The Weekly Collection for the Poor was larger than ever was known; and Dr. <HI>C.</HI> was &s;o affected, that he wi&s;h'd him&s;elf a <HI>de&s;pi&s;ed</HI> METHODIST. <HI>We are not fit for</HI> GOD <HI>to work by, till we are de&s;pi&s;ed by Men; that the Excellency and Power of Preaching may be &s;een to be from</HI> GOD <HI>only.</HI></P>
<P>Din'd at Governour <HI>S</HI>&mdash;'s; and at the Reque&s;t of the Inhabitants and Gentlemen of the Gari&s;on, preach'd a &s;earching Sermon in the Afternoon. Expounded in the Evening, to above a thou&s;and Hearers, of all Denominations. Supp'd with General <HI>C.</HI> and went Home betimes, full of

Methinks I hear my dear Friends &s;ay, &s;ilently, AMEN; <HI>and may the Great</HI> GOD <HI>&s;ay &s;o too!</HI></P>
<P><HI>Monday, March</HI> 6. Had near, if not more than a Thou&s;and, at Morning Expo&s;ition; and it being the la&s;t Day of my Sojourning at <HI>Gibraltar,</HI> many came to me weeping, telling me what God had done for their Souls; de&s;iring my Prayers, and promi&s;ing me theirs in Return. Others both gave and &s;ent me Tokens of their Love, &mdash; as Cake, Figs, Wine, Eggs, and other Nece&s;&s;ari<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s for my Voyage; and &s;eem'd to want Words to expre&s;s their Affection. &mdash; <HI>Surely they would have plucked out their own Eyes to have given me. &mdash; The good Lord note their Kindne&s;s in his Book, and reward them a thou&s;and-fold!</HI></P>
<P>About Twelve, went to the Church, accord|ing to Appointment; and made a farewel Ex|hortation, as GOD gave me Utterance, to a great Number of weeping Soldiers, Women, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Then kneel'd down, and having recommended each other to the Care of GOD, I left them; went out and took my Leave of the two Generals. Vi&s;ited the confin'd Pri&s;oner. Din'd at a Gen|tlewoman's Hou&s;e in the Town. Left near fifty Letters to be &s;ent to <HI>England,</HI> and about

Four went on Board; accompanied to the Sea-&s;ide with near 200 Soldiers, Women, Officers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> who all &s;orrow'd at my Departure, and wi&s;h'd me good Luck, in the Name of the Lord. <HI>Surely I may now expect greater Succe&s;s abroad, having &s;uch an Addition of Interce&s;&s;ors on my Behalf!

<P><HI>Sam&s;on's</HI> Riddle has been fulfill'd at <HI>Gibraltar; out of the Eater came forth Meat, out of the Strong came forth Sweetne&s;s.</HI> Who more unlikely to be wrought upon, than Soldiers! &mdash; And yet, among any Set of People I have been, where has GOD made his Power more to be known! Many that were quite &s;tark Blind, have received their Sight; many that have fallen back, have re|lented, and turned unto the Lord again; many that were a&s;hamed to own CHRIST openly, have waxen bold; and many that were Saints, have had their Hearts fill'd with Joy un&s;peakable, and full of Glory. <HI>This is the Lord's doing, and it is marvellous in our Eyes! May he give a Ble&s;&s;ing to the Books di&s;per&s;ed among them, and perfect the good Work begun in their Hearts, till the Day of the Lord</HI> JESUS! <HI>May they be my Joy and Crown of Rejoicing at the la&s;t Day! And may</HI> GOD<HI>'s Mercies to me in every Place make me more humble, more zealous, more thankful, and more ready to do, or &s;uffer, whatever my dear Redeemer has allotted for me. Into his Hands I commend my Spirit, as into the Hands of an all-powerful Pre&s;erver.</HI></P>
<P>About Five, came on Board, and was mo&s;t

gladly received by my Flock; whom I hope to love better, for being a little ab&s;ent from them. Interceeded, and gave Thanks (as u&s;ual) at Night upon Deck; and was plea&s;ed that I was again retir'd from the World. It rain'd much, but that made as the more fervent. <HI>Water us, O Lord, we be&s;eech thee, with the Dew of thy heavenly Benediction!</HI></P>
<P><HI>Tue&s;day, March</HI> 7. Went and conver&s;ed with, and di&s;per&s;ed &s;ome proper Books among the Soldiers that we took from <HI>Gibraltar.</HI> Three of them belonged to one of the Societies. and de&s;ired, with &s;ome others, to &s;ail in our Ship. GOD <HI>&s;anctify my Mini&s;try unto them!</HI> Mo&s;t of them are of the <HI>Scotch</HI> Church, but &s;eemed very willing to conform. <HI>What a Pity is it,</HI> CHRIST<HI>'s &s;eamle&s;s Coat &s;hould be rent in pieces on Account of Things, in them&s;elves purely indifferent!</HI></P>
<P>At Dinner we were like to be &s;truck again&s;t, by the Man of War. I &s;aw it coming, and compo&s;ed my &s;elf for Death; but GOD had Mercy on us&punc; commanded the Wind to &s;hift about, and deliver'd us out of &s;o great a Danger. <HI>O that we may &s;hew forth our Thankfulne&s;s, not only with our Lips, but in our Lives! How ought Creatures to live, who are every Moment liable to be called by Death to Judgment!</HI></P>
<P>This Day &s;et &s;ail from <HI>Gibraltar</HI>; at fir&s;t the Wind was fair, but afterwards blew contrary; which made both me and many others &s;ick. I &s;hould have wonder'd if GOD had not &s;ent me a Thorn in the Fle&s;h, after &s;uch abundant Succe&s;s. <HI>May I learn to</HI> SUFFER, <HI>as well as</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, <HI>thy Will, O</HI> GOD.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="004453_0021_100D9E88170A25C8">Had u&s;eful Conference with Capt. <HI>M.</HI> who was an In&s;trument (under God) of introducing me at <HI>Gibraltar,</HI> and who, I tru&s;t, will make a devout Centurion. <HI>Grant this, heavenly Father, for thy dear Son's &s;ake.</HI></P>
<P>Fini&s;h'd my Expo&s;ition on the Creed, in the great Cabin, and did my other Duty in the Ship as u&s;ual. The Wind blew hard, and GOD &s;ent abroad his Lightnings great Part of the Day. <HI>J. D.</HI> my Friend <HI>H.</HI> and my &s;elf al&s;o, were &s;ick, but not &s;o, as to prevent our Interce&s;&s;ion for ab&s;ent Friends. <HI>Whatever befalls me, O Lord, may I never forget their Works and Labour of Love; as yet, ble&s;&s;ed be</HI> GOD! <HI>they are always on my Mind, and I bear them on my Heart, when|&s;oever I go in, and from before the Lord.</HI> And nothing does and will &s;upport me more, under all Cro&s;&s;es, than the Hopes of &s;eeing them grown in Grace, when I return to <HI>England.

<P>Gave my &s;elf (as much as my Indi&s;po&s;ition of Body would give me Leave) to the Word of GOD, and Prayer; and was much affected with what is &s;aid of <HI>Hezekiah,</HI> that becau&s;e he was not thankful enough, <HI>for the great Things</HI> GOD <HI>had done for him, he was permitted to fall, thro' the Pride of his Heart. Alas! What Danger am I in of &s;haring the &s;ame Fate! O my Friends, cry mightily to</HI> GOD, <HI>that no &s;uch Evil come upon me!</HI></P>
<P>Married a Couple on Deck; Capt. <HI>M.</HI> Capt. <HI>W. &amp;c.</HI> attended very orderly. I endeavour'd to give them a &s;uitable Exhortation, after the Solemnity was over; and hope this Couple did

call CHRIST to their Marriage. <HI>It's through a Neglect of this, that we have &s;o few happy Matches.</HI></P>
<P>The contrary Wind &s;till continuing, my Sea-Sickne&s;s increas'd mo&s;t bravely, &s;o that I was obliged to omit reading Prayers to the Soldiers, and to go to Bed &s;ooner than u&s;ual. I find this Sickne&s;s will purge my Body, and hope, thro' Grace, it will purify my Soul. &mdash; <HI>Every Branch that beareth Fruit, &s;ays Chri&s;t, my Father purgeth it, that it may bring forth more Fruit. May that Scripture be fulfilled in my Heart!</HI></P>
<P>My bodily Indi&s;po&s;ition &s;till increa&s;ed. There was a great Storm without; but, ble&s;&s;ed be GOD! a Calm within. Sometimes indeed my Will would inwardly rebel, which plainly &s;hew'd me, what a Di&s;tance I was from GOD; but I hope through inward, and outward Sufferings, I &s;hall at length be able to &s;ay in all Things, &mdash; <HI>Fat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">er, not my Will, but thine be done.</HI></P>
<P>Did my u&s;ual Duty in the great Cabin; and began expounding the ten Commandments.

<P><HI>Saturday, March</HI> 11. Ble&s;&s;ed be God, the Storm this Morning began to blow over, and Light broke in upon my Soul. Was enabled to read Prayers, and expound both in the Cabin,

and to the Soldiers, with more Vigour than I have &s;ince I left <HI>Gibraltar.</HI> Had Rea&s;on to think that Capt. <HI>M.</HI> grew in Grace, and that my late Indi&s;po&s;ition had been &s;anctify'd unto me. <HI>Suffering Times are Chri&s;tians be&s;t improving Times; for they break the Will; wean us from the Creature; prove the Heart; and by them God teacheth his Children, as</HI> Gideon, <HI>by Thorns and Briars, taught the Men of</HI> Succoth.</P>
<P>All the Time of my Indi&s;po&s;ition, my dear Friend <HI>H.</HI> mourn'd over me like a Dove. <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed be God, Familiarity does not breed Contempt be|tween us; but our Love to each other increa&s;es daily.</HI> JESUS CHRIST <HI>is the only Rock, whereon true Friend&s;hip can be built.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sunday, March</HI> 12.

<P>Preach'd the Sermon (GOD enabled me to make, in the Storm, before we came to <HI>Gibraltar</HI>) in the great Cabbin, and GOD was pleas'd to &s;et his Seal to it.

<P>Had much of the Pre&s;ence of GOD with me; and felt &s;uch a fervent Love for my Chri&s;tian Friends, that I feared how I &s;hould behave, was GOD to call any of them from me. <HI>But I tru&s;t, &s;ufficient for &s;uch an Hour w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">uld be the Strength thereof.</HI></P>

Marry'd a Couple. Di&s;pers'd Bibles, Te&s;taments, Soldier's Monitors, among the Men. Exchang'd &s;ome Books for &s;ome Cards, which I threw over|board. Preach'd a Sermon again&s;t Drunkenne&s;s, which GOD enabled me to fini&s;h Ye&s;terday; and returned in the Evening, highly delighted with &s;eeing the Porpu&s;&s;es roll about the great Deep. <HI>O Lord! the Sea is full of thy Riches!

<P><HI>Sunday, March</HI> 19. Went on board the <HI>Amy</HI>&punc; Read Prayers, and preach'd to above 200 Hearers, and marry'd a Couple, which did not behave &s;o well as I could wi&s;h. The Bridegroom laugh'd &s;everal Times, in the mid&s;t of the Solemnity; on which I &s;hut up the Book; but he &s;hewing his Repentance by Weeping, I then proceeded, and gave to him and the Bride a Bible, as the be&s;t Pre&s;ent I could <HI>make them,</HI> and exhorted all to Holine&s;s of Life.

<P>Had near two Hours clo&s;e Conver&s;ation with Capt. <HI>M.</HI> in whom appear'd many Marks of the <HI>New-Birth.</HI> Surely he will prove a devout Centurion. <HI>How &s;hall I be con&s;train'd, 'till it be accompli&s;hed!</HI></P>
<P><HI>Tue&s;day, March</HI> 21. Had fre&s;h Rea&s;on to be thankful. Capt. <HI>M.</HI> made me a kind Pre&s;ent. The Weather exceeding plea&s;ant, and, what was the greate&s;t Ble&s;&s;ing of all,&mdash; GOD's holy Spirit &s;eem'd to be moving on the Faces <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> of the Souls in the Ship. The Weather growing warmer, Friend <HI>H.</HI> had &s;ome Cloths hung over to cover his School. His Children come very regularly both to learn, and to &s;ay their Prayers at Night. Capt. <HI>W.</HI> takes great Delight in them. Capt. <HI>M.</HI> much encourages the Soldiers to learn to read and write; &s;o that we begin to live as regular now, as we could wi&s;h to do on Shore. <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed be</HI> GOD, <HI>for thus making his Power to be known!</HI></P>

<P><HI>Wedne&s;day, March</HI> 22. Saw a large Grampus rolling and &s;pouting out Water, for a long while&punc; at a &s;hort Di&s;tance from our Ship.

<P><HI>Saturday, March</HI> 25. Sail'd 154 Miles the la&s;t 24 Hours. Was much delighted in &s;eeing many Porpu&s;&s;es playing about the Ship; one of which Capt. <HI>W.</HI> catch'd, and Part of its Liver we had dre&s;&s;ed for Dinner.

<P><HI>Sunday, March</HI> 26. This Day I hope GOD magnified his Power, in the Conver&s;ion of a young Gentleman on Board, whom he had been plea&s;ed to vi&s;it with a Fever.

<P>Preach'd a Sermon in the Afternoon, on <HI>Luke</HI> iii.14. <HI>And the Soldiers likewi&s;e came unto Him, and demanded, &s;aying, And what mu&s;t we do? And he &s;aid unto them, Do Violence to no Man, neither accu&s;e any Man fal&s;ly, and be content with your Wages.</HI> I made it at the Reque&s;t of Capt. <HI>M.</HI> who &s;eems in earne&s;t about the great Work of his Salvation.

Do thou ble&s;s them unto him, and they &s;hall be ble&s;&s;ed.</HI></P>
<P>Exchanged &s;ome bad Books that were on Board, (which I threw immediately into the Sea) for &s;ome good ones. Ble&s;&s;ed be GOD! all I have found them with, (as yet) have been ready to &s;urrender them up; and I find it by daily Ex|perience more and more, that People who are thoroughly awakened to a Sen&s;e of the divine Life, cannot bear to read any thing trifling; but throw away their u&s;ele&s;s Books, as tho&s;e did the Books of Divination and curious Arts, which we read of in the <HI>Acts,</HI> who were converted by St. <HI>Paul.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Monday, March</HI> 27. La&s;t Night GOD was plea&s;ed to take away a black Boy of Capt. <HI>Wh&mdash;'s,</HI> after he had been ill of a violent Fever for &s;ome Days. &mdash; He was never baptized, but I had a Commi&s;&s;ion from his Ma&s;ter (who
<PB N="32" REF="004453_0032_100D9EA3508B65B8">
&s;eem'd much affected at his Death) to in&s;truct and baptize him, if it plea&s;ed GOD he &s;hould recover; but GOD &s;aw fit to order it otherwi&s;e: <HI>His holy Will be done!</HI> &mdash;</P>
<P>About Ten in the Morning, he was wrapped up in a Hammock, and thrown into the Sea. I could not read the Office over him, being un|baptized; but Capt. <HI>M.</HI> order'd the Drum to beat, and I exhorted all the Soldiers, Sailors, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as GOD gave me Utterance, to <HI>remember their</HI> CREATOR <HI>in the Days of their Youth, and prepare for the Time when the Sea &s;hould give up its Dead, and all Nations be called together, to appear before the</HI> SON <HI>of</HI> GOD. <HI>O that they may be made wi&s;e by it! that they may lay to Heart what has been &s;aid, and practically con&s;ider their latter End!</HI></P>
<P>Had our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour been here, I believe he would have wept to &s;ee what Havock Sin has made among us. <HI>Do thou, Lord, teach us &s;o to number our Days, that we may apply our Hearts to Wi&s;dom.</HI></P>
<P>This Day Capt. <HI>M.</HI> began to come at Six in the Morning, and join in Prayers on Deck, in&s;tead of having Prayers in the great Cabin. Surely our Soldiers will be without Excu&s;e, &s;ince their Captain leads &s;o good an Example. Ble&s;&s;ed be GOD, I have no Rea&s;on to complain of them, for they come very regularly twice a Day to Prayers; and an Oath &s;eems to be a &s;trange Thing among them. Many Marks of a &s;ound Conver&s;ion appear in &s;everal on Board; and we live in perfect Harmony and Peace,
<PB N="33" REF="004453_0033_100D9EA5B0CEE368">

<P><HI>Wedne&s;day, March</HI> 29. Sail near 160 Miles every 24 Hours, for &s;everal Days. Mo&s;t delightful plea&s;ant Weather, and much of God's Pre&s;ence among us.</P>
<L>Heav'n is, dear Lord, where-e'er thou art;</L>

<P><HI>Friday, March</HI> 31. This being the Crucifixion of our ble&s;&s;ed Lord, I preached a Sermon on the penitent Thief; and I hope God gave it his Ble&s;&s;ing. We began Prayers later than u&s;ual; &s;o, before I had done, Darkne&s;s came upon us, which put me in Mind of that Darkne&s;s which overwhelm'd the World, when the GOD of Nature &s;uffer'd. <HI>O that our Hearts may rend like the Rocks, and our Souls ari&s;e from the Death of Sin, as the Bodies of tho&s;e did from their Graves, to appear to many in the holy City, after our LORD's Re&s;urrection!</HI></P>
<P>Had a good In&s;tance of the Benefit of breaking Children's Wills betimes. La&s;t Night, going between Decks, as I do every Night, to vi&s;it the Sick, and examine my People, I asked one of the Women to bid her little Boy, that &s;tood by her, &s;ay his Prayers: She an&s;wer'd, his elder Si&s;ter would, but &s;he could not make him. Upon this, I bid the Child kneel down before me, but he would not, till I took hold of his Feet, and forc'd him down. I then bid him &s;ay the Lord's Prayer, being informed by his Mother, he could &s;ay it if he would; but he ob&s;tinately refu&s;ed, till at la&s;t, after I had given him &s;everal Blows, he &s;aid his Prayers as
<PB N="35" REF="004453_0035_100D9EAB2AECA9A8">
well as I could expect. I gave him &s;ome Figs for a Reward, and lo! this &s;ame Child, tho' not above four Years of Age, came to-night upon Deck, when the other Children came to &s;ay their Prayers, to my Friend <HI>H.</HI> and he bur&s;t out into a Flood of Tears, and would not go away till he had &s;aid his too.</P>
<P>I mention this as a Proof of the Nece&s;&s;ity of early Correction. Children are &s;en&s;ible of it &s;ooner than Parents imagine; and if they would but have Re&s;olution to break their Wills throughly when young, the Work of Conver&s;ion would be much ea&s;ier, and they would not be &s;o troubled with perver&s;e Children when they are old.</P>
<P><HI>Saturday, April</HI> 1. Wonderful plea&s;ant Sailing &s;till; but, what was intirely better, had Rea&s;on to think &s;everal went forward in the great Work of their Salvation. <HI>O that we may be buried with</HI> CHRIST <HI>in Bapti&s;m, and ri&s;e with him to New|ne&s;s of Life!</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sunday, April</HI> 2. Ro&s;e early this Morning, and join'd in Spirit with my dear ab&s;ent Friends, who were receiving the Holy Euchari&s;t, and celebrating our ble&s;&s;ed Lord's Re&s;urrection. I find my not being in Prie&s;t's Orders is a great Hindrance to my Mini&s;try; which will oblige me to return to <HI>England</HI> as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible. <HI>The good Lord prepare me for that &s;econd Impo&s;ition of Hands.</HI></P>
<P>Preached a Sermon in the Afternoon on <HI>Phi|lippians</HI> ii.10. <HI>That I may know him, and the Power of his Re&s;urrection. O that we may all experience it in our Hearts! for without it,</HI> Chri&s;t, <HI>as to us, is dead in vain.</HI></P>

Had &s;ome further Conver|&s;ation with the young Gentleman, who&s;e Con|ver&s;ion I mentioned before, and who, I hope, is quickened from above.

<P><HI>April</HI> 7. Great Enlargement of Heart has been given me for the&s;e four Days la&s;t pa&s;t; par|ticularly to-day, in which God hath vouch&s;afed me much of his Pre&s;ence, and a&s;&s;i&s;ting Grace. Ob&s;erved &s;till &s;trong Signs of a thorough Con|ver&s;ion being wrought in &s;ome on Board. Had mo&s;t delightful Sailing, and every Thing that is plea&s;ant, as this vain World can afford.

The Ship &s;ail'd all Day, as tho' &s;he was carried on the Wings of the Wind. Preached two Sermons, be&s;ides my Expo&s;ition at Six in the Morning, and I hope God &s;et his Seal to them.

<P><HI>April</HI> 15. This Morning I buried the dead Soldier, in Time of public Prayers. Cho&s;e pro|per Le&s;&s;ons, and gave the Soldiers a &s;uitable Ex|hortation.

<P>To-day was call'd in a Hurry to pray by one of the devout Soldiers, who came from <HI>Gibral|tar,</HI> and who was &s;uppos'd to be expiring. I came; I &s;aw; I rejoiced in Spirit, for his Soul &s;eem'd full of GOD. In&s;tead of being affrigh|ted at the Approach of the King of Terrors, he welcom'd it, and &s;aid he was going to his dear Redeemer. Then he fell, as it were, into a Trance, and pour'd out his Heart in repeating &s;ome very applicable Ver&s;es out of the P&s;alms, on which we thought he would have died. But lo! GOD brought him from the nethermo&s;t Hell! for that In&s;tant the Fever left him, and he recover'd. <HI>O what Difference is there be|tween him that feareth</HI> GOD, <HI>and him that feareth him not, in their la&s;t Hours!</HI> LORD, <HI>let me die the Death of the Righteous, and let my future State be like his.</HI></P>

<P>After this &s;everal Squalls came upon us, which afforded me glorious Matter for adoring that great GOD, whom Winds and Storms obey. &mdash; The Sailors were in great Hurry and Con|fu&s;ion, but, to my Comfort, not one &s;ingle Oath was heard all the while. &mdash; A Proof this, that Sailors may pull the Ropes, without &s;wearing; and that the Words &s;poken to them, have not altogether fallen to the Ground. &mdash; <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed be God!</HI></P>
<P><HI>April</HI> 22. Fled, as it were, on the Wings of the Wind, for &s;ome Days pa&s;t. Sometimes 170, &s;ometimes 178 Miles in 24 Hours. I find GOD generally &s;ends us the &s;tronge&s;t Winds,

<P>Spent mo&s;t of this Day in writing Letters to my dear Friends in <HI>England.</HI> In particular, Supplication for Direction how to act, in the Land whither I am going. The Thoughts of my own Weakne&s;s, and the Greatne&s;s of tho&s;e Trials, which I mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily expect, fill me with an holy Dread. But wherefore do I fear? The Eternal, Almighty, I AM, hath &s;ent me, and will, no Doubt, protect me.</P>
<P><HI>April</HI> 23. Preach'd twice to-day to my People, and &s;pent mo&s;t of the re&s;t of the Day in earne&s;t Prayer for the Divine A&s;&s;i&s;tance, in my pre&s;ent Undertaking; being, as we imagin'd, near the Haven where we would be. The Morning Le&s;&s;ons were exceeding applicable, &s;o that we could not help taking Notice of it. <HI>By this I know</HI> GOD <HI>favours me.</HI></P>
<P><HI>May</HI> 1. This Morning went out on Deck; after being confin'd to my Bed for a Week by a violent Fever, with which all, except three or four in the Ship, have been vi&s;ited. I was blooded thrice; vomited once, and bli&s;ter'd; and, ble&s;&s;ed be GOD, can &s;ay, <HI>'tis good for me that I have been afflicted</HI>; for as Affliction abounded, Con&s;olation much more abounded, and God enabled me to <HI>rejoice with Joy un&s;peak|able and full of Glory. Satan de&s;ired to have me, to &s;ift me as Wheat; but</HI> JESUS CHRIST <HI>pray'd for me, and my Faith fail'd not.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="004453_0043_100D9EBEAAFDDFE8">I have all the Conveniencies I could have on Shore. Capt. <HI>W.</HI> turn'd out of his own Bed for me. <HI>J.

<P>I hope I &s;hall now experimentally &s;ympathize with tho&s;e that are &s;ick; and learn to be more tender-hearted to my Fellow Chri&s;tians. I am <HI>now made whole. May I &s;in no more,</HI> but be more fervent in Spirit, &s;erving the Lord, <HI>le&s;t a wor&s;e Evil befal me.</HI></P>
<P><HI>May</HI> 5. About Ten o' Clock this Morning, buried the Cook of the Ship, who expired la&s;t Night. I could have wi&s;h'd for a thou&s;and Tongues, to have &s;ounded a loud Alarm to my People; but the Sight of the Corps, and the Weakne&s;s of my Body, would but ju&s;t permit me to read out the Office. <HI>Lord what is Man! O! why are others taken, and I left, but that</HI> GOD<HI>'s Long-&s;uffering &s;hould lead me to Repentance! Grant it, O Lord, for thy dear</HI> SON<HI>'s &s;ake.</HI></P>
<P>In the Afternoon privately, I baptiz'd a new-born Infant. Thus it is; &s;ome coming into the World, others going out of it continually. <HI>Good God, who can de&s;ire to live here always.</HI></P>
<P>After having lain about the Coa&s;t for a Week, this Afternoon we &s;aw <HI>Savannah River,</HI> and &s;ent off for a Pilot. O what Joy appear'd in every one's Countenance! How infinitely more

<P><HI>Sunday, May</HI> 7. La&s;t Night, by the Ble&s;&s;ing of GOD, we ca&s;t Anchor near <HI>Tibby I&s;land,</HI> about 24 Miles off <HI>Savannah</HI>; and to-day GOD gave me Strength to preach my Fare|wel Sermon; which I have not &s;ent you, and at which many wept.

<P>In the mean Time, fail not to give Thanks for all the Mercies I have received, tho' we had a long, yet it was an exceeding plea&s;ant Pa&s;&s;age.

<HEAD>A CONTINUATION OF Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI>'s JOURNAL, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>SUNDAY, <HI>May</HI> 7. Arrived at <HI>Savannah</HI> Town about &s;even this Evening, and joined in Prayer, and a P&s;alm of Thank&s;giving with Mr. <HI>Delamotte,</HI> and &s;ome pious Souls that were rejoiced at my Arrival: <HI>The good</HI> LORD <HI>&s;anctify our meeting to his Glory, and his People's Welfare.</HI></P>
<P>Spent the remainder of the Evening in taking &s;weet Coun&s;el with Mr. <HI>Delamotte,</HI> who &s;eems providentially left behind at <HI>Savannah</HI> again&s;t my coming.

Begun to read publi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rayers and expound the &s;econd Le&s;&s;on at Fiv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> Morning to &s;eventeen Adults and twenty <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Children. <HI>May</HI> GOD <HI>open their Hearts, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> may attend to the Things that were &s;poken.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="004453_0049_100D9ECE07A945F0">In the Afternoon Mr. <HI>Cau&s;ton</HI> &s;ent Word that he and the Magi&s;trates would wait upon me, but I cho&s;e rather to wait upon them. I was re|ceived with great Civility, and our chief Con|ver&s;ation ran upon the Place of my Settlement; at la&s;t it was re&s;olved that I &s;hould have a Hou&s;e and Tabernacle built at <HI>Frederica,</HI> and &s;erve at <HI>Savannah,</HI> when, and as long as I plea&s;ed. I find there are many Divi&s;ions among&s;t the In|habitants, but GOD, I hope, will make me an In&s;trument of compo&s;ing them: <HI>Grant this, O LORD, for thy dear Son's &s;ake.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sunday, May</HI> 14. After another Week's Confinement, by the Return of my Fever, un|der which GOD &s;hewed me great Mercies, and which went off with a Fit of the Ague, I attempted to read Prayers, but was &s;o exceeding <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">aint and weak, that I was obliged to leave off before I began the &s;econd Service. <HI>Oh that my Friends had &s;een me at that Hour, they then might have learnt not to have any Man's Per&s;on in Ad|miration, and not to think more highly of me than they ought to think.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Tue&s;day, May</HI> 16. Having by the Ble&s;&s;ing of GOD gotten a little Strength, I went to &s;ee <HI>To<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> Chachi,</HI> who, I heard, was near expiring at a Neighbour's Hou&s;e. He lay on a Blanket thin and meagre, and little el&s;e but Skin and Bones. <HI>Senauki</HI> &s;at by fanning him with &s;ome <HI>Indian Feathers.</HI> There was no Body that could talk <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> &s;o I could only &s;hake Hands and leave him.</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="004453_0050_100D9ED055660700"><HI>Friday, May</HI> 19. GOD &s;till &s;trengthening me more and more, I went this Morning to two little Villages, <HI>Hamp&s;tead</HI> and <HI>Highgate,</HI> about Five Miles off <HI>Savannah</HI>: The former con&s;i&s;ts of three Families, making in all eleven Souls, one Man a <HI>Jew</HI>; two Men, one Woman and &s;even Children <HI>Swi&s;&s;ers.</HI> I was much delighted with &s;eeing the Improvements a few pair of Hands had made in their re&s;pective Plantations, and was &s;urprized to &s;ee what Indu&s;try will do. Surely they &s;peak not Truth, who &s;ay that the <HI>Georgia</HI> People have been idle; for I never &s;aw more laborious People than are in the&s;e Villages. They live exceeding hard, but with a little A&s;&s;i&s;tance may do very well. I was at a Lo&s;s, becau&s;e I could not talk <HI>French,</HI> but however I re&s;olved, under GOD, to follow my worthy Predece&s;&s;or's Example, and to vi&s;it them once a Week, and read Prayers to as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ny as could under&s;tand me. I al&s;o enquired into the State of their Children, and found there were many who might prove u&s;eful Members of the Colony, if there was a proper Place provided for their Maintenance and Education. Nothing can effect this but an Orphan-Hou&s;e, which might ea&s;ily be erected at <HI>Savannah,</HI> would &s;ome of tho&s;e that are rich in this World's Good contribute towards it. <HI>May</HI> GOD, <HI>in his due Time, &s;tir up the Wills of his faithful People to be ready to di&s;tribute, and willing to communicate on this commendable Occa&s;ion.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Saturday, May</HI> 20. Went once more to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>To<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> Chachi,</HI> hearing his Nephew <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">

who was there, who could talk <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> I de&s;ired of him to enquire of his Uncle, Whether he thought he &s;hould die; who an&s;wer'd, He could not tell: I then asked where he thought he &s;hould go after Death? He replied, to Heaven. <HI>But alas, how can a Drunkard enter there!</HI> I then exhorted <HI>Tooanoowee</HI> (who is a tall proper Youth) not to get drunk, telling him, he under|&s;tood <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and therefore would be puni&s;hed the more if he did not live better. I then asked him, Whether he believed a Heaven? He an|&s;wer'd, <HI>Yes.</HI> I then asked, Whether he believed a Hell? and de&s;cribed it by pointing to the Fire, he replied, <HI>No.</HI> From whence we may ea&s;ily gather how natural it is to all Mankind to believe there is a Place of Happine&s;s, becau&s;e they wi&s;h it may be &s;o, and on the contrary, how <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ver&s;e they are to believe a Place of Torment, becau&s;e they wi&s;h it may not be &s;o. But GOD is true and ju&s;t, and as &s;urely as the Good &s;hall go into everla&s;ting Happine&s;s, &s;o the Wicked &s;hall go into everla&s;ting Puni&s;hment.</P>
<P><HI>Wedne&s;day, May</HI> 24. Went to Day to <HI>Thun|derbolt,</HI> a Village about &s;ix Miles off <HI>Savannah,</HI> &s;ituated very plea&s;antly near the River, and con&s;i&s;ting of three Families, four Men and two Women, and ten Servants; I was kindly recei|ved, expounded a Chapter, u&s;ed a few Collects, called on a Family or two that lay near our Way, and returned home to <HI>Savannah</HI> very comforta|bly, with my Friend <HI>Delamotte,</HI> about &s;ix o'Clock in the Evening. <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed be GOD for &s;trengthen|ing my weak <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ody.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="004453_0052_100D9ED461988278"><HI>Friday, June</HI> 2. This Evening parted with kind Captain <HI>Whiting</HI> and my dear Friend <HI>Delamotte,</HI> who embarked for <HI>England</HI> about &s;even at Night. The poor People lamented the Lo&s;s of him, and went to the Water-&s;ide to take a la&s;t Farewel. And good Rea&s;on had they to do &s;o: For he has been indefatigable in feeding CHRIST's Lambs with the &s;incere Milk of the Word, and many of them <HI>(Ble&s;&s;ed be GOD)</HI> have grown thereby. Surely I mu&s;t labour mo&s;t heartily, &s;ince I come after &s;uch worthy Pre|dece&s;&s;ors. The Good that Mr. <HI>John We&s;ly</HI> has done in <HI>America,</HI> under GOD, is inexpre&s;&s;ible&punc; His Name is very precious among the People; and he has laid &s;uch a Foundation, that I hope neither Men nor Devils <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ill ever be able to &s;hake. <HI>Oh that I may <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">llow him, as he has Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Monday, June</HI> 5. Had a Conference with a certain Per&s;on of the Pari&s;h, who, I heard la&s;t Night, had been broaching many heretical Doctrines to one of my Friends, particularly in denying the Eternity of Hell-Torments. I therefore invited him this Morning to Breakfa&s;t; and after imploring God's A&s;&s;i&s;tance in the Spirit of Meekne&s;s, I asked him, <HI>Whether he believed the Eternity of Hell-Torments?</HI> He an&s;wer'd frankly, No. I replied, <HI>What do you mean, Sir, when you repeat the</HI> 12<HI>th Article of our Creed?</HI> He &s;aid, he believed wicked Men were to be annihilated. I then read <HI>Pear&s;on's</HI> Expo&s;ition of the la&s;t Article, but he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> all&punc; &s;aid he thought him&s;elf in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">
<PB N="54" REF="004453_0053_100D9ED638B447F8">
believed it his Duty to inform Mankind, that they were to be annihilated. Upon which I repeated to him that Pa&s;&s;age out of the <HI>Reve|lations. If any Man &s;ball take away from or add unto Words that are written in this Book, GOD &s;hall take away his Name out of the Book of Life, and add unto him all the Plagues that are written in this Book.</HI> This he &s;aid he believed. Afterwards we di&s;cour&s;ed afre&s;h, but finding him re&s;olute to propagate his Principles, I then told him with the utmo&s;t Calmne&s;s that I was &s;orry that I gave him the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> at the Sacrament; but for the futu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> pardon me if I refu&s;ed ever to give <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">.

But I told him I &s;hould meet him at the Judgment-Seat of CHRIST, and then he would &s;ee upon what Principles I acted. <HI>May</HI> GOD <HI>give me Grace not to regard the Faces of Men, but with an humble well guided Zeal and Courage to watch the Flock over which the Holy Gho&s;t has made me Over&s;eer.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Saturday, June</HI> 10. Placed one that came with me, at <HI>Highgate,</HI> to teach the Children <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> that belong to that Village and <HI>Hamp|&s;tead.</HI> They are about Twenty in all, of <HI>French</HI> Extraction, but &s;ome few of them are able to &s;peak a little in our vulgar Tongue. I thought placing a Ma&s;ter there would be of great Con|&s;equence. <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Becau&s;e I cannot think Chil|dren will ever be naturaliz'd to the Colony, till <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> talk our Language. <HI>Secondly,</HI> Becau&s;e
<PB N="55" REF="004453_0054_100D9EDA64B42228">
the pre&s;ent Generation will &s;oon wear off, and the&s;e Children being well in&s;tructed in ours, will make them forget their own Tongue&punc; and &s;hould they marry and have Children, they would naturally teach their Children the &s;ame; &s;o that at Length we &s;hall all be of one Speech. <HI>Thirdly,</HI> As they are but few in Number, and no likelihood of any <HI>French</HI> Mini&s;ter to come among&s;t them; I or my Succe&s;&s;ors &s;hall be un|able to catechi&s;e or bring them to hear the Word of GOD at our Church, unle&s;s they are acquainted with the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Tongue.</P>
<P><HI>Monday, June</HI> 11, Opened a School to Day for the Girls of <HI>Savannah,</HI> a Friend, who&s;e Heart GOD was plea&s;ed to touch on Board the Ship, having at my Reque&s;t undertaken to teach them. The Work is for my Ma&s;ter, and therefore I doubt not of being &s;upplied &s;ome Way or another with a &s;ufficient Fund for the Support of it. <HI>May GOD enable him who is &s;et over them to feed them with the &s;incere Milk of the Word, and give them Grace to grow thereby?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thur&s;day, June</HI> 22. Was taken (as all about me thought for Death) with a violent Purging and Vomiting, which in the Space of five Hou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e quite exhau&s;ted my Spirits, and brought me in Appearance, almo&s;t to the Point of Death. But God &s;upported me by his inward Comforts, cau&s;ed me to rejoice in it; and ca&s;t me into a deep Sleep, out of which I awoke perfectly well, to the Surprize of all about me. <HI>O <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> can expre&s;s the loving Kindne&s;s of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">

<P><HI>Friday, June</HI> 24. To the great Surpri&s;e of my&s;elf and People, was enabled to read Prayers and preach with Power before the Free-Ma&s;ons, with whom I afterwards dined, and was u&s;ed with the utmo&s;t Civility. <HI>May</HI> GOD <HI>make them Servants of</HI> CHRIST, <HI>and then and not till then will they be free indeed.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Friday, July</HI> 7. Being the Anniver&s;ary for opening the Court, I preached in the Morning at the Magi&s;trate's Reque&s;t, and endeavoured with all Plainne&s;s and Humility to &s;hew both them and the People, what they ought to do to promote their Temporal and Eternal Welfare. <HI>O GOD, do thou ble&s;s it, and it &s;hall be ble&s;&s;ed thro'</HI> JESUS CHRIST.</P>

Their Lands are improved &s;urpri&s;ingly for the Time they have been there, and I believe they have far the be&s;t Crop of any in the Colony. &mdash; They are ble&s;s'd with two &s;uch pious Mini|&s;ters as I have not often &s;een; They have no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of Judicature, but all little Differences

are immediately and implicitly decided by their Mini&s;ters, whom they look upon and love as their Fathers. They have likewi&s;e an Orphan-Hou&s;e, in which are &s;eventeen Children, and one Widow, and I was much delighted to &s;ee the Regu|larity wherewith it is managed. &mdash; <HI>O that GOD may &s;tir up the Hearts of his Servants to contribute towards that and another which we hope to have erected at</HI> Savannah. &mdash; Mr. <HI>Bo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">zius,</HI> one of their Mini&s;ters, being with me on <HI>Saturday,</HI> I gave him &s;ome of my Poor's Store for his Or|phans, and when I came to <HI>Ebenezer,</HI> he call'd them all before him, catechi&s;ed and exhorted them to give GOD Thanks for his good Provi|dence towards them; then prayed with them, and made them pray after him; then &s;ung a P&s;alm, and afterwards the little Lambs came and &s;hook me by the Hand one by one, and &s;o we parted, and I &s;carce was ever better plea&s;ed in my Life. &mdash; Surely whoever contributes to the Re|lief of the <HI>Saltzburghers,</HI> will perform an ac|ceptable Sacrifice to our Ble&s;&s;ed Ma&s;ter. They are very poor; but with a little A&s;&s;i&s;tance might live comfortably and well. They want a Place for Public Wor&s;hip, and Money to buy Cattle and other Nece&s;&s;aries for the Orphan-Hou&s;e and People. <HI>May the great GOD rai&s;e up In|&s;truments to a&s;&s;i&s;t and relieve them; for &s;urely they are worthy.</HI></P>

about twelve Miles off. &mdash; Their Beginnings as yet are but &s;mall, but I cannot help thinking there are Foundations laying for great temporal and &s;piritual Ble&s;&s;ings in <HI>Georgia,</HI> when the In|habitants are found worthy. &mdash; Ble&s;&s;ed be GOD, in <HI>Savannah</HI> they will hear the Word gladly, and People every where receive me with the utmo&s;t Civility, and are not angry when I re|prove them. &mdash; <HI>May GOD keep them always thus minded, and prepare me for whatever Suf|ferings he &s;hall permit to fall upon me for doing my Duty.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Saturday, Augu&s;t</HI> 12. This Afternoon was alarmed with the News of a Family Di&s;a&s;ter.

Before I left <HI>Savannah,</HI> the Le&s;&s;on appointed for the Morning, was St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s Shipwreck, out of the <HI>Acts,</HI> and before I left <HI>Charles-Town,</HI> the Le&s;&s;on was the fir&s;t of <HI>Jonah,</HI> both which made &s;uch a deep Impre&s;&s;ion upon me, that I wrote to my Friend <HI>Haber&s;ham,</HI> to acquaint him I was apprehen&s;ive we &s;hould have a dangerous Voyage: Since I have been on Board, what St. <HI>Paul</HI> &s;aid to his Companions,
<Q>That he perceived their Voyage would be to their great Damage,</Q>
has frequently been pre&s;s'd upon my Heart; and GOD has now &s;hewn me wherefore he gave me the&s;e previous Notices.&mdash;For on <HI>Tue&s;day</HI> Night la&s;t, after we had &s;ailed 150 Miles, the la&s;t twenty-four Hours, about Eleven o'Clock aro&s;e a &s;udden violent <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> Wind, which continued till about Four in the Morning, and put all the Sailors to their Wits End.&mdash; Mo&s;t of them declared they never had &s;een the like before. The main Sail was &s;lit in &s;everal Pieces, and &s;everal of the other Sails, and much of the Tackling all to Tatters; not a dry Place was to be found in all the Ship: The Captain's Hammock, in the great Cabin, was half filled with Water; and though I lay in the mo&s;t dry Part of the Ship, yet the Waves broke in upon me twice or thrice. In &s;hort, all was Terror and Confu&s;ion, Men's Hearts failing

them for fear, and the Wind and the Sea ra|ging mo&s;t horribly. But GOD (<HI>for ever be a|dored his unmerited Goodne&s;s</HI>) was exceeding gra|cious unto me. For I felt a &s;weet Complacen|cy in my Will, in Submi&s;&s;ion to his. Many particular Promi&s;es GOD has made me from his Word, that I &s;hould return in Peace, flowed in upon my Heart. And he enabled me greatly to rejoice.&mdash;This is the fir&s;t Day we have ven|tured to pull down any of our dead Lights, which put me in Mind of the long Night the <HI>Egyptians</HI> once &s;aw. But I &s;pent my Time in reading, and fervent Interce&s;&s;ion for ab&s;ent Friends, and com|forted my&s;elf much with the Remembrance of them; mo&s;t of fre&s;h Provi&s;ions are wa&s;hed over Board, and our Tackling much out of order, &s;o that we have a Pro&s;pect but of an indifferent Voyage. But ble&s;&s;ed be GOD, the Pro&s;pect plea&s;es me. For now I &s;hall learn, I tru&s;t, how to want as well as how to abound, and how to endure Hard&s;hip like a good Soldier of JESUS CHRIST. <HI>O LORD let thy Strength be magni|fied in my Weakne&s;s, &s;ay unto my Soul,</HI>
<Q>It is I, be not afraid, and then let Storms and Tem|pe&s;ts do their wor&s;t.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Saturday, Octob.</HI> 7. This has been a Week, ble&s;&s;ed be GOD, though not of much Action, yet full of Opportunities of exerci&s;ing my pa&s;|&s;ive Graces!

<P>A few Days agone I flatter'd my&s;elf we &s;hould be &s;oon at our de&s;ired Port, but GOD is plea&s;ed to defer the Accompli&s;hment of my Hopes: However, <HI>ble&s;&s;ed be his Name, He enables me to give Thanks.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Sunday, October</HI> 22. At the De&s;ire of the Captain preached my Sermon on ra&s;h Anger, having hitherto u&s;ed to expound only.

<P><HI>Saturday, October</HI> 28. Sailed about 300 Miles the four fir&s;t Days of this Week: Had a little Storm on <HI>Wedne&s;day</HI> Night, and a great Calm ever &s;ince. We are now within 150 Leagues of Land, and our Provi&s;ions and Water very &s;canty, and our Ship very weak;

<P><HI>Monday, October</HI> 30. Still GOD is plea&s;ed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the Wind, what there is of it, &s;hould be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">trary, and our Ship's Company are now <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rought into great Streights. Their Allowance of Water is a Quart a Day, and our con&s;tant Food for &s;ome Time has been on Salt Beef and Water Dumplins, which do not agree with the Stomachs of &s;ome among&s;t us. But GOD enables me to rejoice in that and all other our Nece&s;&s;ities, yea, He &s;o comforts me that many I believe are &s;urpri&s;ed at my Chearfulne&s;s. But when we are de&s;titute of outward Comforts, then does GOD more comfort our Souls. This Morning when I awoke, the Faith of <HI>Abraham</HI>

<P>I warm my&s;elf by &s;miling on, and exhorting them, and this Afternoon we joined in &s;olemn Prayers &s;uitable to our pre&s;ent Circum&s;tances. <HI>LORD, let our Cry come unto thee.</HI> I know it will, and that we &s;hall be an&s;wer'd, if it be be&s;t.

<P><HI>Wedne&s;day, November</HI> 1. This Afternoon, about four o'Clock, as I was in Secret, humbling my Soul before GOD, interceding for my Friends, and had been praying for a fair Wind, and A&s;&s;i&s;tance in the great Work lying before me, News were brought that the Wind was fair; which put me in Mind of the Angel's being &s;ent to <HI>Daniel,</HI> to tell him his Prayer was heard, when he was humbling his Soul with Fa&s;ting, and praying for the Peace and Re&s;to|ration of <HI>Jeru&s;alem.</HI> Indeed I cannot &s;ay I have purpo&s;ely, for the&s;e three Weeks, eat no plea&s;ant Food, or fa&s;ted, as he did; but our Food is &s;o &s;alt, that I dare eat but little, &s;o that I am now literally in Fa&s;tings often. <HI>O that I may improve this ble&s;&s;ed Sea&s;on for Humiliation and extraordinary Acts of Devotion, that I may be duly prepar'd to approve my&s;elf a faithful Mini&s;ter of JESUS CHRIST, whether by Honour or Di&s;honour, by evil Report or good Report.</HI></P>
<P>As &s;oon as we found the Wind fair, we join'd in Thank&s;giving, and in &s;inging the fir&s;t Part of the 34th <HI>P&s;alm</HI> (new Ver&s;ion) which was very applicable to our Circum&s;tances. For they tell me they have not above three Days Water on Board, allowing a Quart to each Man a Day. But he, that at one Time, at the Reque&s;t of his

<P><HI>Thur&s;day, Nov.</HI> 4. For the&s;e two Days la&s;t pa&s;t, GOD has been plea&s;ed greatly to humble my Soul, and bring me low by Spiritual De&s;er|tions. And to Day he has thought proper again to &s;end us a contrary Wind, ble&s;&s;ed be his Name. Our Allowance of Water now is but a Pint a Day; &s;o that we dare not eat much Beef. Our Sails are exceeding thin; &s;ome more of them were &s;plit la&s;t Night, and no one knows where we are; but GOD does, and that is &s;ufficient.</P>
<P>La&s;t Night He lifted up the Light of his ble&s;&s;ed Countenance upon me, and to Day fills me with Joy un&s;peakable, and full of Glory; &s;o that though I have little to eat, yet I inwardly po&s;&s;e&s;s all Things. I am &s;ometime afraid le&s;t continued Ab&s;tinence may occa&s;ion a bodily Sickne&s;s. But wherefore do I fear? If it does, that and every Thing el&s;e I know will work for my Good. &mdash; What I mo&s;t dread, is le&s;t any on Board &s;hould charge GOD fooli&s;hly; but I check the fir&s;t Motions I di&s;cern ari&s;ing in any one's Heart, and endeavour to ju&s;tify our good

<P>This is now the eighth Week I have been Aboard. If my Friends a&s;k me, why I arrived no &s;ooner, I may truly an&s;wer, <HI>Satan</HI> hinder'd us. For I believe it is he who is permitted to do this; but this &s;till gives me greater Hopes, that a more effectual Door than ever, will be be open'd in <HI>England,</HI> for preaching the ever|la&s;ting Go&s;pel. <HI>O Satan, Satan, I defy thee to do thy wor&s;t; thou may&s;t to&s;s me up and down, and bring me into Jeopardy on every Side; but JESUS CHRIST is praying for me on the Mount.

<P><HI>Sunday, Nov.</HI> 5. This Day we rejoiced with trembling. For though we thereon commemo|rated our Deliverance from the <HI>Gunpowder-Plot,</HI> yet as our Circum&s;tances call'd for Acts of Hu|miliation, I u&s;ed Part of the Office of Commina|tion, (be&s;ides &s;olemn Prayer and P&s;alms three Times) and enlarged on the&s;e Words of St. <HI>James,</HI>
<Q>My Brethren, count it all Joy, when ye fall into diver&s;e Temptations; knowing this, that the trying of your Faith worketh

Patience: But let Patience have her perfect Work.</Q>
I hope this had a good Effect upon my Hearers Hearts, and calm'd their Spirits. For indeed we are brought very low: But I can &s;ay with the penitent Thief,

<P><HI>Monday, Nov.</HI> 6. La&s;t Night, about &s;even o'Clock, GOD was plea&s;ed to &s;uffer a violent Wind to ari&s;e, which would not permit me to ri&s;e till this Afternoon, about which Time it be|gan in &s;ome mea&s;ure to abate. Ble&s;&s;ed be GOD through the Precaution u&s;ed by our Ship-Mates, we &s;hip'd but little Water, only we were driven &s;ome Leagues back. The Weather was pretty cold, and a little Cake or two baked on the Coals, and a very little Salt-Beef was all my Provi&s;ion for the Day; but thus <HI>Elijah</HI> lived for a long while, and why not I? Nay, he fa&s;ted forty Days and forty Nights. And though I dare not pre&s;ume to do &s;o, yet if GOD &s;till brings me into greater Wants, I doubt not, but I &s;hall find that Man liveth not by Bread alone, but by every Word that proceedeth out of the Mouth of GOD. <HI>LORD, I de&s;ire not to be exempted from &s;ufferings, but to be &s;upported under them. If thy Glory can be promoted by my Tryals, lo, here I am, &s;courge me, try me as it &s;eemeth good in thy Sight!</HI></P>

<P>When my Spirits are gone, I then find my Faith, as it were, le&s;s lively; But I tru&s;t that is only owing to the Frame of my Body. For at all other Times I have great Confidence in God!

<P>Great Part of this Day I lay down, being weak and much oppre&s;&s;ed in my Head; but at Night when &s;ome doubted what the End of this Vi&s;itation would be, the following Ver&s;es were with great Comfort pre&s;&s;ed upon my Soul.

<P>Still greater Mercies GOD confers on his unworthy Servant.

<P>In my Way I had a &s;hort Conference with a <HI>Roman Catholic,</HI> who &s;eem'd more knowing than the Generality of tho&s;e of that Per&s;ua&s;ion, but &s;adly mi&s;guided. My main Drift was to con|vince him he was impo&s;ed upon. <HI>Am I?</HI> &s;ays he, with great Earne&s;tne&s;s, <HI>did I know that, I would follow him,</HI> i. e. <HI>the Prie&s;t, no longer.</HI></P>
<P>As far as I can find by all I conver&s;e with, they place Religion in being of the <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> or <HI>Roman Catholic</HI> Communion, and are quite igno|rant of the Nature of inward Purity and Holi|ne&s;s of Heart.&mdash; <HI>Lord, the Chri&s;tian World is ca&s;t into a deep &s;leep, &s;end forth, I be&s;eech thee, &s;ome faithful and true Pa&s;tors to awaken them out of it.</HI></P>

<P>Two Things I can remark much for the Credit of <HI>Ireland,</HI> that the Roads, e&s;pecially to <HI>Dublin,</HI> are &s;urprizingly good, and Provi&s;ions exceeding <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">heap. A Per&s;on may travel without much Expence.</P>

<P><HI>Sunday, Nov.</HI> 26. Preached twice to Day at the Churches of <HI>Waborough</HI> and St. <HI>Andrew</HI>'s&punc; I believe with Succe&s;s; for GOD enabled me to &s;peak with Power.

<P><HI>Tue&s;day, Nov.</HI> 28. By the Advice, and through the Introduction of Dr. <HI>Delany,</HI> I waited on Dr. <HI>Rundle,</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>Londonderry,</HI> and on his Grace the Arch-Bi&s;hop of <HI>Armagh,</HI> Lord <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">imate of all <HI>Ireland</HI>; the former engaged me

<P>FRIDAY, <HI>December</HI> 8. About Noon I reached <HI>London,</HI> was received with much Joy by my Chri&s;tian Friends, and joined with them in P&s;alms and Thank&s;giving for my &s;afe Arrival. My Heart was greatly enlarged hereby.</P>
<P>In the Evening went to a truly Chri&s;tian Society in <HI>Fetter-Lane,</HI> and perceived God had greatly watered the Seed &s;own by my Mini&s;try, when la&s;t at <HI>London. The Lord increa&s;e it more and more.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Saturday, Dec.</HI> 9. Waited this Morning on the Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> and the Bi&s;hop of <HI>London,</HI> and met with a favourable Reception.</P>
<P><HI>Sunday, December</HI> 10. When I was on Board the <HI>Mary,</HI> tho&s;e particular Parts of the Book of <HI>Jeremiah,</HI> which relate to the Oppo&s;ition he met with from the Fal&s;e Prophets, were deeply

impre&s;&s;ed upon my Soul. And now I begin to &s;ee the Wi&s;dom of God in it. For five Churches have been already denied me, and &s;ome of the Clergy, if po&s;&s;ible, would oblige me to depart out of the&s;e Coa&s;ts. <HI>But I rejoice in this Oppo&s;ition, it being a certain Sign that a more effectual Door will be opened, &s;ince there are &s;o many Adver&s;aries.</HI></P>
<P>However, I had an Opportunity of preaching in the Morning at St. <HI>Helen</HI>'s, and at <HI>I&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ngton</HI> in the Afternoon, to large Congregations in|deed, with great Demon&s;trations of the Spirit, and with Power.</P>
<P>Here &s;eems to be a great pouring out of the Spirit; and many, who were awakened by my Preaching a Year ago, are now grown &s;trong Men in CHRIST, by the Mini&s;trations of my dear Friends and Fellow-Labourers, <HI>John</HI> and <HI>Charles W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ley. Ble&s;&s;ed be God, I rejoice in the Coming of the Kingdom of his dear Son.</HI></P>
<P>The old Doctrine about Ju&s;tification by Faith only, I found much revived, and many Letters had been &s;ent concerning it to me, all which, I providentially mi&s;&s;ed of. For now, I come un|prejudiced, and can the more ea&s;ily &s;ee who is in the Right.

<P><HI>Friday, Febr.</HI> 2. Slept about two Hours, ro&s;e and went and preached at <HI>I&s;lington,</HI> and collected twenty-two Pounds for my Orphan-hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Had a great Number of Communicants, and was told my preaching was attended with un|common Power. This is the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> Time I have preached without Notes, (for when I preached at <HI>Deptford</HI> and <HI>Grave&s;end,</HI> I only repeated a written Sermon) but I find my&s;elf now, as it were, con&s;trained to do it.</P>
<P>Expounded in the Evening, and collected three Pounds for the Orphan-hou&s;e, at Mr. <HI>Abbot</HI>'s; preached extempore with great Free|dom at <HI>Wapping-Chappel,</HI> then expounded to another Society, and returned Home without Fatigue or Wearine&s;s. <HI>How does GOD deal

Staid at Home this Day on purpo&s;e to &s;ettle my private Affairs; and, ble&s;&s;ed be GOD, did it greatly to my Satisfaction. &mdash; Was very much compo&s;ed in Spirit, began a new Society at the Hou&s;e of Mr. <HI>M&mdash;n</HI>; and was much a&s;&s;i&s;ted in expounding twice at <HI>Beech-lane</HI> to two Companies, making in all near a thou&s;and People. &mdash; Vi&s;ited a &s;ick Brother, came home full of Peace, and Love, and Joy in the <HI>Holy Gho&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>Near nine Times has GOD enabled me to preach this Week, and to expound 12 or 14 Times; near forty Pounds, I believe, have been collected for the Orphan-hou&s;e. &mdash; <HI>I find I gain greater Light and Knowledge, by preaching extempore. &mdash; So that I fear I &s;hould quench the Spirit, did I not go on to &s;peak as he gives me Utterance.</HI></P>

Courage to begin, and before I had done I waxed warm and &s;trong in Spirit, and offered JESUS CHRIST freely to all that would lay hold on him by Faith.

<Q>that he would not give any po&s;itive Leave, neither would he prohibit any one that &s;hould lend me a Church; but he would advi&s;e me to withdraw to &s;ome other Place till he had heard from the Bi&s;hop, and not preach on that or any other Occa&s;ion.</Q>
I asked him his Rea&s;ons. He an&s;wered,

<P>About three in the Afternoon, GOD having given me great Favour in the Jaylor's Eyes, I preached a Sermon on the <HI>Penitent Thief</HI> to the poor Pri&s;oners in <HI>Newgate,</HI> and collected fifteen Shillings for them. &mdash; Many &s;eemed much affected, and I hope the Power of the LORD was pre&s;ent to awaken them.</P>

<P><PB N="152" REF="004453_0151_100D9FB3D5F66020">Preached at <HI>Newgate</HI> with uncommon Free|dom and Power, and ob&s;erved the Audience to be quite melted down, After this I made a Collection for the poor Pri&s;oners, and at my Return home was much comforted by another gracious Soul, whom GOD brought unto me, and who was willing to follow me not only to <HI>Georgia,</HI> but al&s;o to Pri&s;on and to Death.</P>
<P>At three in the Afternoon, according to my Appointment, I went to <HI>King&s;wood</HI> among&s;t the Colliers. GOD highly favoured us in &s;ending a fine Day, and near two Thou&s;and People were a&s;&s;embled on that Occa&s;ion. I preached on <HI>John</HI> ch. iii. ver. 3. and enlarged for near an Hour, I hope, to the Comfort and Edification of tho&s;e that heard me. <HI>GOD grant the Seed &s;own may not fall on &s;tony or thorny, but on good Ground.</HI></P>
<P>About &s;ix in the Evening, I expounded to a Society without <HI>Lawford's Gate,</HI> and afterwards to another in <HI>Baldwin-&s;treet</HI>; both were ex|ceedingly crowded and attentive. At fir&s;t I could not &s;peak &s;o &s;trongly, becau&s;e I had exerted my&s;elf &s;o much upon the Mount; but after|wards GOD gave me a fre&s;h Supply of Grace, and I was enabled to go through my Work chearfully. <HI>Lo!

<P><HI>Friday, February</HI> 23. Returned hither about Ten this Morning. About Eleven, went, as u&s;ual, and preached a written Sermon at <HI>New|gate,</HI> and collected two Pounds five Shillings for the Pri&s;oners. <HI>Many, I believe, were much affected. To GOD be all the Glory.</HI></P>
<P>After Dinner, I was taken very ill, &s;o that I was obliged to lie upon the Bed; but, looking upon it only as a Thorn in the Fle&s;h, at three I went, according to Appointment, and preached to near four or five Thou&s;and People, from a Mount in <HI>King&s;wood,</HI> with great Power.

I asked him his Rea&s;ons for prohibiting my collecting for the Orphan-hou&s;e. He an&s;wered, It would hinder the People's Benefactions to the <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> Clergy. I replied, It would by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o Means hinder their Contributions, and that the Clergy ought fir&s;t to &s;ub&s;cribe them&s;elves for Example's Sake. &mdash; After much Conver&s;ation on this Subject, I, with all Meek|ne&s;s, told him, I was re&s;olved to go on preach|ing, and that if Collections were not made here for the poor <HI>Georgians,</HI> I would lay it entirely upon him; adding withal, I would not be one that &s;hould hinder &s;uch a De&s;ign for the Univer&s;e.</P>

<P>At the Inn where we put up there was an unhappy Clergyman, who (&s;o far had his Corruptions dominion over him) would not go over in the Pa&s;&s;age-Boat becau&s;e I went in it. <HI>Alas!</HI> thought I, <HI>this very Temper would make Heaven it&s;elf unplea&s;ant to that Man, if he &s;ave me there.</HI> I was likewi&s;e told, that in the publick Kitchin, he charged me with being a Di&s;&s;enter; when a little after, as I pa&s;&s;ed by, I &s;aw him &s;haking his Elbows over a Gaming-table. <HI>I heartily wi&s;h tho&s;e who charge me cau&s;ele&s;ly with Schi&s;m, and being righteous over-much, would con&s;ider that the Canon of our Church forbids our Clergy to frequent Taverns, to play at Cards or Dice, or any other unlawful Games.

<P>After Supper, in the Evening, I called the Family of the Inn together, and was plea&s;ed to &s;ee near twenty come to hear the Word.

Aro&s;e before twelve <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Night, &s;ung P&s;alms, and prayed; and the Wind being fair, we had a &s;peedy Pa&s;&s;age over <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the <HI>Welch</HI> Shore. Our Bu&s;ine&s;s being in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">aste, GOD having of his good Providence, &s;ent <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> to guide us, we rode all Night, &s;topped at <HI>Newport</HI> to refre&s;h our&s;elves, where we met with two Friends, and reached <HI>Cardiff</HI> about eleven. in the Morning.</P>
<P>The Town, I &s;oon found, was apprehen&s;ive of my coming; and therefore, whil&s;t I was giving a Word of Exhortation to &s;ome poor People at the Inn, who hanged upon me to hear the Word, Mr. <HI>Seward</HI> went to a&s;k for the Pulpit? but being denied, we pitched on the Town-Hall, which Mr. <HI>Seward</HI> got by his Intere&s;t; and at four in the Afternoon, I preached from the Judges Seat to about four hundred Hea|rers. Mo&s;t were very attentive; but &s;ome mocked: However, I offered JESUS CHRIST freely even to them, and &s;hould have rejoyced if they would have accepted of him; but their fooli&s;h Hearts were hardned. <HI>LORD, make them Monuments of thy free Grace.</HI></P>
<P>After I came from the Seat, I was much refre&s;hed with the Sight of my dear Brother <HI>Howel Harris</HI>; whom, though I knew not in Per&s;on, I have long &s;ince loved in the Bowels of JESUS CHRIST, and have often felt my Soul drawn out in Prayer in his Behalf.</P>

Immorality, and an indefatigable Promoter of the true Go&s;pel of JESUS CHRIST. About three or four Years GOD has inclined him to go about doing good. He is now above Twenty five Years of Age. Twice he has applied (being every Way qualified) for holy Orders; but was refu&s;ed, under a fal&s;e Pretence, that he was not of Age, though he was then Twenty-two Years and &s;ix Months. About a Month ago he offered him&s;elf again, but was put off. Upon this, he was, and is &s;till re&s;olved to go on in his Work; and indefatigable Zeal has he &s;hewn in his Ma&s;ter's Service. For the&s;e three Years (as he told me from his own Mouth) he has di&s;cour&s;ed almo&s;t twice every Day for three or four Hours together; not authoritatively, as a Mini&s;ter; but as a private Per&s;on, exhorting his Chri&s;tian Brethren. He has been, I think, in &s;even Counties, and has made it his Bu&s;ine&s;s to go to Wakes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to turn People from &s;uch lying Vanities. Many Ale-hou&s;e People, Fidlers, Harpers, <HI>&amp;c. (Demetrius</HI> like) &s;adly cry out again&s;t him for &s;poiling their Bu&s;ine&s;s.

But GOD has ble&s;&s;ed him with inflexible Courage: In&s;tantaneous Strength has been communicated to him from above; and he &s;till continues to go on from conquering to conquer. He is of a mo&s;t Catholic Spirit, loves all that love our Lord JESUS CHRIST, and therefore he is &s;tiled by Bigots, <HI>a Di&s;&s;enter.</HI> He is contemned by all

<P>When I fir&s;t &s;aw him, my Heart was knit clo&s;ely to him. I wanted to catch &s;ome of his Fire, and gave him the right Hand of Fellow|&s;hip with my whole Heart. After I had &s;aluted him, and given a warm Exhortation to a great Number of People, who followed me to the Inn, we &s;pent the Remainder of the Evening in taking &s;weet Coun&s;el together, and telling one another what GOD had done for our Souls. My Heart was &s;till drawn out towards him more and more. A divine and &s;trong Sympathy &s;eemed to be between us, and I was re&s;olved to promote his Intere&s;t with all my Might. Ac|cordingly we took an Account of the &s;everal Societies, and agreed on &s;uch Mea&s;ures as &s;eemed mo&s;t conducive to promote the common Intere&s;t of our Lord. <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed be GOD, there &s;eems to be a noble Spirit gone out into</HI> Wales; <HI>and I believe, e'er long there will be more vi&s;ible Fruits of it.

<P>This done, we eat a little Supper, and then, after &s;inging a Hymn, we went to Bed, prai&s;ing and ble&s;&s;ing GOD, for bringing us Face to Face.

<P>After Dinner, I went and preached at the <HI>Fi&s;h-ponds,</HI> as u&s;ual, where were many Coaches, and about as great a Number of People as before. GOD gave me great Freedom and Power.

with their Mites, that I wanted &s;omebody to hold up my Hands. &mdash; The Chearfulne&s;s with which they gave is inexpre&s;&s;ible, and the many Prayers they joined with their Alms, I hope, will lay a good Foundation for the Hou&s;e in|tended to be built. &mdash; After this, GOD brought me to &s;ome more of his own dear Children, and I &s;pent the Remainder of the Evening in ex|pounding to a Society, where almo&s;t all were drowned in Tears, when I mentioned my De|parture to them. &mdash; <HI>The good LORD, &s;end &s;ome|body among&s;t them to water what his own Right Hand hath planted.

<P><HI>Sunday, March</HI> 25.

<P>Preached at <HI>Hannam</HI> to a larger Congregation than ever, and preached again in the Afternoon to upwards (as was computed) of 23000 People.

I was afterwards told, that tho&s;e who &s;tood farthe&s;t off could hear me very plainly. <HI>Oh may</HI> GOD <HI>&s;peak to them by his Spirit, at the &s;ame Time that he enables me to lift up my Voice like a Trumpet!</HI></P>
<P>About eight I went to the Society in <HI>Nicholas-&s;treet,</HI> I with great Difficulty, at la&s;t got up into the Room, which was extreamly hot. GOD enabled me to &s;peak with much Freedom and Power; and at the Clo&s;e of my Exhortation, I recommended a Charity-&s;chool, which was opened by this Society to-day.

<P><HI>Monday, March</HI> 26. Still GOD has plea&s;ed to give me fre&s;h Tokens of his Love. Letters are &s;ent me, and People come to me continually, telling me what GOD had done for their Souls by my unworthy Mini&s;try.</P>
<P>At four in the Afternoon, I preached again at the <HI>Bowling-Green,</HI> to, I believe, &s;even or eight Thou&s;and People. The Sun &s;hone bright, and the Windows and Balconies of the adjoining Hou&s;es were filled with H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">arers.

at the Right Hand of GOD. The Concern the People were in is inexpre&s;&s;ible. &mdash; An hearty Groan goes through them all when any Thing affecting is &s;poken; and I am &s;ure, that Thou&s;ands come not out of Curio&s;ity, but a &s;incere De&s;ire of being fed with the Milk of the Word &mdash; Afterwards, I again collected for the Orphan-hou&s;e, and it was near an Hour and a half before the People could go out.

<P>At eight I ha&s;ted to <HI>Weavers Hall,</HI> in <HI>Temple-&s;treet,</HI> which was procured me becau&s;e the Society Rooms were too little.

<P>After I had done, I went to a Chri&s;tian Hou&s;e, where many waited for me; and, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> my Return home, my Ma&s;ter paid me my Wages: For my Soul was filled with an Inten&s;ene&s;s of Love, and I knew what it is not only to have Righteou&s;|ne&s;s and Peace, but Joy in the Holy Gho&s;t. <HI>This is my continual Food.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Tue&s;day, March</HI> 27. At four this Afternoon, being invited &s;everal Times, I preached in a Yard belonging to the Gla&s;s-Hou&s;es, where many dwell, who (as I was informed) neither feared GOD, nor regarded Man. The Con|gregation con&s;i&s;ted of many Thou&s;ands, and
<PB N="185" REF="004453_0184_100DA00780B8AD58">
GOD enabled me to lay before them his Threat|nings and Promi&s;es; &s;o that none might either de&s;pair or pre&s;ume. <HI>O that I may be t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ught of GOD rightly to divide the Word of Truth!</HI></P>
<P>Whil&s;t I was preaching, I heard many People behind me, hollowing and making a Noi&s;e, and &s;uppo&s;ed they were &s;et on by &s;omebody on pur|po&s;e to di&s;turb me.&mdash; I ble&s;s GOD I was not in the lea&s;t moved, but rather increa&s;ed the more in Strength; but when I had done, and enquired the Cau&s;e of that Noi&s;e, I was informed, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Gentleman (being drunk) had taken the Liberty to call me <HI>Dog,</HI> and &s;ay, <HI>That I ought to be whipped at the Cart's Tail, and offered Money to any that would pelt me.</HI> In&s;tead of that, the Boys and People near him began to ca&s;t Stones &amp; Dirt at him. &mdash;I knew nothing of it till afterwards, when I expre&s;&s;ed my Di&s;like of their Behaviour, but could not help ob&s;erving, <HI>what &s;orry Wages the Devil gives his Servants.</HI></P>

Extraordinary Power GOD was plea&s;ed to give me.

<P><HI>Tue&s;day, April</HI> 17. Spent this Morning in vi&s;iting a private Society, and conver&s;ing with many religious Friends, who came from far to take their Leave. &mdash; About eleven, by the Bi&s;hop's Permi&s;&s;ion, I baptized, at the Church of <HI>St. Mary de Crypt,</HI> Mr. <HI>Thomas W&mdash;d,</HI> a profe&s;&s;ed Quaker, about &s;ixty Years of Age, who was convinced of the Nece&s;&s;ity of being born again of <HI>Water</HI> as well as the <HI>Spirit.</HI> Many of CHRIST's faithful Servants a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ended on the Prayers around him; and, I believe, the Holy Gho&s;t was with us of a Truth. &mdash; After the Solemnity was over, I gave a Word of Exhortation from the Font; and it being the Place where I my&s;elf not long &s;ince had been baptized, it gave me an Opportunity of reflect|ing on my own frequent Breaches of my bap|ti&s;mal Vow, and proving the Nece&s;&s;ity of the <HI>New-Birth</HI> from the Office of our Church. <HI>GOD, I believe, gave it his Ble&s;&s;ing.</HI></P>

Thanks be to GOD, we talked with great Sweetne&s;s and Chri&s;tian Love, and unanimou&s;ly declared again&s;t the Principles of our three Bre|thren, who lately made &s;uch Confu&s;ion in <HI>Oxford.

<P><HI>Thur&s;day, April</HI> 26.

Surely the Hea|rers Hearts were quite melted down by the preaching of the free Grace of GOD in CHRIST JESUS to poor Sinners.

<P>Expounded at Night to a very large Society in <HI>Wapping,</HI> with great Power, and perceived that the <HI>London</HI> People were much improved &s;ince I left them; indeed their Hearts &s;eem to be quite broken, and I believe they would pluck out their Eyes if it were po&s;&s;ible to &s;erve me.

<P>Being weakened by my Morning's preaching, in the Afternoon I refre&s;hed my&s;elf by a little Sleep, and at five went and preached at <HI>Ken|nington Common,</HI> about two Miles from <HI>London,</HI> where no le&s;s than thirty Thou&s;and People were &s;uppo&s;ed to be pre&s;ent; the Wind being for me, it carried the Voice to the extreme&s;t Part of the Audience.</P>
<P>All &s;tood attentive, and joined in the P&s;alm and Lord's Prayer mo&s;t regularly, &mdash; and I &s;carce ever preached more quietly in any Church.&mdash; The Word came with Power. &mdash; The People were much affected&punc; and expre&s;&s;ed their Love to me many Ways. &mdash; All agreed it was never &s;een on this wi&s;e before. <HI>Oh what need have all GOD's People to rejoyce and give Thanks!

<P>I received your Letter, which was a full An&s;wer to my Queries, and give you my hearty Thanks for the Trouble you have taken upon you (the only Gratitude I can at pre&s;ent pay) but he, whom I have perfectly at Heart, will &s;upply the Deficiency to you, and will not &s;uffer a meritorious Act to go unrewarded.

Then he varied again, and thought it convenient for me to &s;tay the Summer, and &s;o to take Phy&s;ick twice a Week, fearing a Relap&s;e.

</LETTER>
<P>Upon reading this, I was &s;en&s;ibly touched with a Fellow-feeling of his Mi&s;ery; and, at my Reque&s;t, Mr. <HI>Seward,</HI> and two more Friends, waited upon the Committee. But alas! they e&s;teemed my Friends as much mad as the young Man, and frankly told them, both I and my Followers, in their Opinion, were really be&s;ides them&s;elves. My Friend <HI>Seward</HI> urged the
<PB N="237" REF="004453_0236_100DA0443B5AE688">
Example of the young Per&s;ons, who called the Prophet that was &s;ent to anoint <HI>Jehu</HI> King, a mad Fellow; &mdash; of our LORD, whom his own Relations, and the <HI>Scribes</HI> and <HI>Phari&s;ees,</HI> took to be mad, and be&s;ides him&s;elf; &mdash; and <HI>Fe&s;tus</HI>'s Opinion of <HI>St. Paul.</HI> &mdash; He further urged, that when young People were under their fir&s;t A|wakenings, they were u&s;ually tempted by the Devil to run into &s;ome Extremes. But all &s;uch Language confirmed the Gentlemen more and more, that Mr. <HI>Seward</HI> was mad al&s;o. And to prove that the young Man was certainly mad, they called one of the Attendants, who &s;aid, when Mr. <HI>Periam</HI> fir&s;t came into the Place, he &s;tripped him&s;elf to his Shirt, and prayed. &mdash; The Rea&s;on of this, as Mr. <HI>Periam</HI> &s;aid after|wards, was, that he might i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ure him&s;elf to Hard&s;hip at once: For being brought from <HI>Bethnall Green,</HI> where he was taken great Care of, into a cold Place without Windows, and a damp Cellar under him, he thought it be&s;t to &s;ea&s;on him&s;elf at fir&s;t, that he might learn to endure Hardne&s;s as a good Soldier of JESUS CHRIST. In the mid&s;t of the Conference, &s;ome Way or other, they mentioned his going to <HI>Georgia,</HI> and &s;aid, if I would take him with me, they would engage that his Father &s;hould give Leave to have him relea&s;ed. &mdash; A Day or two after, Mr. <HI>Seward</HI> waited upon his Father, who gave his Son an excellent Character, and con&s;ented to his going abroad. &mdash; After this, he waited upon the Doctor, who pronounced him well.&mdash; And to Day he waited again upon the
<PB N="238" REF="004453_0237_100DA045D26EE328">
Committee, who behaved very civilly, and gave the young Man a Di&s;charge.</P>
<P>He is now with me, and I hope will be an In&s;trument of doing good.&mdash; The Hard&s;hips he has indured at <HI>Bethlehem,</HI> will, I hope, prepare him for what he mu&s;t undergo abroad. &mdash; And being now not ignorant of <HI>Satan's</HI> Devices, he will be better qualified to prevent his getting an Advantage over others. Before I leave my Account of him, I cannot help telling what U&s;age he met with at his fir&s;t coming into <HI>Beth|lehem.</HI>&mdash; Being &s;en&s;ible within him&s;elf, that he wanted no bodily Phy&s;ick, he was unwilling at fir&s;t to take it; upon which, four or five took hold of him, cur&s;ed him mo&s;t heartily, put a Key into his Mouth, threw him upon the Bed, and &s;aid (though I had then never &s;een or heard of him) <HI>you are one of Whitefield's Gang,</HI> and &s;o drenched him. &mdash; I hear al&s;o, that there was an Order given, that neither I, or any of my Friends, &s;hould be permitted to come unto him. <HI>Good GOD! how &s;hortly will that Day come when the&s;e unhappy Men &s;hall be heard to cry out,</HI>
<Q>We Fools counted their Lives Madne&s;s, and their Ends to be without Honour! How are they num|bred among the Children of GOD! How is their Lot among the Saints!</Q></P>

<HEAD>OULNEY.</HEAD>
<P>Being much &s;ollicited thereto, after Sermon ye&s;terday, I ha&s;tned, in Company with near a dozen Friends, to <HI>Oulney,</HI> eight long Miles from <HI>Northampton,</HI> and got thither about Ten of the Clock. Great Numbers were a&s;&s;embled toge|ther; but on account of its being a rainy Day it was judged inconvenient to preach in the Fields. I therefore &s;tood upon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Eminence in the Street, and preached from thence with &s;uch Power as I have not for &s;ome Time experienced. Though it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> all the Time, yet the People &s;tood very attentive and patient. All, I really believe, <HI>felt,</HI> as well as <HI>heard</HI> the Word, and one was &s;o p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">icked to the Heart, and convinced of Sin, that I &s;carce ever &s;aw the like In&s;tance. <HI>The Word of GOD is quick and powerful, and &s;harper than a two-edged Sword.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="243" REF="004453_0242_100DA0529B1C4308">Ha&s;ted away as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible from <HI>Oulney</HI> to <HI>Bedford,</HI> where I had promi&s;ed, GOD willing, to preach to Night. About &s;even we got thither, and found the Town fully alarmed. &mdash; About eight, I preached from the Stairs of a Wind-Mill (the Pulpit of my dear Brother and Fellow Labourer Mr. <HI>Rogers</HI>) to about three Thou&s;and People; and GOD was plea&s;ed to give me &s;uch extraordinary A&s;&s;i&s;tance, that I believe few, if any, were able to re&s;i&s;t the Power wherewith GOD enabled me to &s;peak. My Heart was full of GOD, and I &s;pake as one having Authority. GOD cau&s;ed me to renew my Strength, and gave me &s;uch inward Support, that my Journey did not affect me. <HI>As my Day is, &s;o &s;halt my Strength be.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Friday, May</HI> 25. Preached at Seven in the Morning with great Power, and rather a larger Congregation than before.&mdash;Took an affectionate Leave of many gracious Souls, and reached <HI>Hitchin,</HI> ten Miles from <HI>Bedford,</HI> about one of the Clock at Noon.&mdash; The Town, I perceived, was much alarmed, and many devout Souls came from far to hear me.&mdash; About two, I got upon a Table in the Market-place, near the Church; but &s;ome were plea&s;ed to ring the Bells in order to di&s;turb us. Upon this, not having begun, we removed into a mo&s;t commodious Place in the Fields; but being a little fatigued with my Ride, and the Sun beating mo&s;t inten&s;ely upon my Head, I was obliged, in a &s;ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> Time, to break off, being exceeding &s;ick and weak. &mdash; A kind Gentlewoman offered me her Hou&s;e, where

I went, and lay down for about two Hours, and then came and preached near the &s;ame Place, and GOD was with us.&mdash; It was &s;urprizing to &s;ee how the Hearts of the People were knit to me.&mdash; I could have continued longer with them; but being under an Engagement to go to <HI>St. Albans,</HI> I ha&s;tned thither, but could not preach on account of my coming in &s;o late. Great Numbers had been there expecting me; and it grieved me to think how little I could do for CHRIST. <HI>For he is a gracious Ma&s;ter, and had I a Thou&s;and Lives, they &s;hould be &s;pent in his Service.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Saturday, May</HI> 26. Had a comfortable Night's Re&s;t, which much refre&s;hed me. Preached at &s;even in the Morning to about Fifteen hundred People in a Field near the Town with great Power, and got &s;afe to <HI>London</HI> by two in the Afternoon.&mdash; Ble&s;&s;ed be GOD, this has been a Week of fat Things. &mdash; Many further Inroads have been made into <HI>Satan</HI>'s Kingdom.&mdash; Many Sinners convicted, and many Saints much com|forted and e&s;tabli&s;hed in their mo&s;t holy Faith. I find there are &s;ome Thou&s;and &s;ecret ones yet living among&s;t us, that have not bowed the Knee to <HI>Baal,</HI> and this publick Way of acting brings them out. It much comforts me, where|ever I go, to &s;ee &s;o many of GOD's Children, of all Communions, come and wi&s;h me good Luck in the Name of the LORD. I perceive People would be every where willing to hear, if

<P>Received an excellent Letter from the Rev. Mr. <HI>Ebenezer Er&s;kine</HI> of <HI>Scotland,</HI> Brother to Mr. <HI>Ralph Er&s;kine,</HI> acquainting me of his preaching la&s;t Week to Fourteen Thou&s;and People. <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed be GOD, there are more Field-Preachers in the World be&s;ides my&s;elf. The</HI> LORD <HI>furni&s;h us all with &s;piritual Food wherewith to feed &s;o great Multitudes.</HI></P>
<P>Preached in the Evening at <HI>Kennington Common</HI> to about Fifteen Thou&s;and People, and we had an extraordinary Pre&s;ence of GOD among&s;t us. <HI>Oh! that all who object again&s;t this Way of Preaching, would come and &s;ee, &mdash; all &s;incere Per&s;ons mu&s;t go convicted away.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sunday, May</HI> 27. Preached this Morning at <HI>Moorfields</HI> to about Twenty Thou&s;and, and GOD manife&s;ted him&s;elf &s;till more and more. My Di&s;cour&s;e was near two Hours long. My Heart was full of Love; and People were &s;o melted down on every Side, that the greate&s;t Scoffer mu&s;t have owned that this was the Finger of GOD. Went twice to public Wor&s;hip, received the ble&s;&s;ed Sacrament, and preached, as u&s;ual, in the Evening at <HI>Kennington Common,</HI> to about the &s;ame Number of People as I did la&s;t Lord's Day. Perceived I was a little hoar&s;e; but GOD &s;trengthned me to &s;peak &s;o as not only to be heard, but felt by mo&s;t that &s;tood near me. <HI>Glory be to GOD on high.</HI></P>

Preached, after earne&s;t and frequent Invitation, at <HI>Hackney,</HI> in a Field belonging to one Mr. <HI>Rudge,</HI> to about Ten Thou&s;and People. &mdash; I in&s;i&s;ted much upon the Rea&s;onablene&s;s of the Doctrine of the <HI>New Birth,</HI> and the Nece&s;&s;ity of our receiving the Holy Gho&s;t in its &s;anctifying Gifts and Graces, as well now as formerly.

<P><HI>Tue&s;day, May</HI> 29.

A mo&s;t com|modious Place was erected for me to preach from. The Word came with Power; and &s;eeing a great Multitude, I thought proper to collect for the Orphan-hou&s;e.

<P><HI>Thur&s;day, May</HI> 31.

It rained &s;ome con&s;iderable Time, but almo&s;t all were unmoved; and I was &s;o enlarged, by talking of the Love and Free Grace of JESUS CHRIST, that I could have continued my Di&s;cour&s;e till Midnight. <HI>This Promi&s;e, They that wait on the Lord &s;hall renew their Strength, is fulfilled in me daily.
