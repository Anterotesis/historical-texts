<L>I WILL REMEMBER THE WORKS OF THE LORD;</L>
<L>SURELY I WILL REMEMBER THY WONDERS OF OLD.</L></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>TO contemplate the being and the works of GOD, is an employment at once the mo&s;t noble, the mo&s;t &s;atisfying and delightful, that can po&s;&s;ibly engage&punc; the minds of intelligent crea|tures. Indeed this is the great end of their being. This is the employment of angels, and of all the heavenly ho&s;ts. Their di&s;tingui&s;hed powers, are con&s;tantly engaged in "looking into," and admi|ring "the manifold wi&s;dom," order and beauty, which &s;hine with peculiar glory in the works of their Maker. And after all the di&s;coveries they have made, &s;till new, and increa&s;ing wonders arise,
<PB N="6" REF="027629_0004_0FD554FCC114CB60">
which add fre&s;h ardor to their de&s;ires, and grow|ing delight and happine&s;s to their minds. And thus it will continue to be, to all eternity.&mdash;And the nearer we re&s;emble the&s;e heavenly intelligences, the greater plea&s;ure &s;hall we take in viewing and contemplating the&s;e objects: until, lo&s;t in won|der, we &s;hall be ready to exclaim,
<Q>Great and marvellous are thy works, LORD GOD ALMIGHTY, ju&s;t and true are thy ways, thou King of &s;aints!</Q></P>
<P>That which principally engages the pious mind in this delightful employment, is, that in the di&s;|covery of the glory of the divine character, di&s;play|ed in his works, he is led to more high and exalted ideas of the ble&s;&s;ed God, and is thence excited to prai&s;e and adore him, to love and tru&s;t in him as the alone SUPREME GOOD&mdash;the only &s;oul-&s;atisfying Object, "in whom is all his &s;alvation and all his de&s;ire."</P>
<P>It was on this ground, the P&s;almi&s;t uttered the pious re&s;olution in the text, "I will remember the works of the Lord&mdash;&s;urely I will remember thy wonders of old." No object afforded him &s;o much delight&mdash;no hours were &s;o agreeably employed, as tho&s;e &s;pent in meditating upon, and recalling to his mind, the great things GOD had done for the chil|dren of men; and particularly, the mighty acts of his power and grace, in favour of his ancient cho&s;en people, in times of old.&mdash;He refers here, doubtle&s;s
<PB N="7" REF="027629_0005_0FD6197938D8CBA0">
to the <HI>wonders</HI> which were wrought by the almighty hand, in the emancipation of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> from their cruel bondage in Egypt, and the great &s;alvation they ex|perienced afterwards.</P>
<P>The pa&s;&s;age before us would lead us into a wide and delightful field for &s;erious and u&s;eful medita|tion. But the time allotted me, and the pre&s;ent &s;ea&s;on, will only permit me to con&s;ider &s;ome of them, which I &s;hall endeavour, under this general DOCTRINE&mdash;</P>
<P>That it is a <HI>duty</HI> incumbent on ALL, and it will be the <HI>delight</HI> of the truly <HI>pious mind,</HI> frequently to <HI>recollect</HI> the WORKS of GOD, and to acknowledge with gratitude his ancient WONDERS to our FATHERS.</P>
<P>Since, by the providence of God, my brethren, this day falls out on the <HI>anniver&s;ary</HI> of the landing of our FOREFATHERS in this place, this &s;ubject &s;eems well calculated to afford us &s;ome agreeable and profitable improvement of that great and a&s;toni&s;h|ing event&mdash;an event, which has been followed with &s;uch great and important con&s;equences to this land; which has laid the foundation of this NEW WORLD; and all tho&s;e &s;urpri&s;ing &s;cenes which have <HI>already</HI> taken place in it&mdash;as well as tho&s;e &s;till greater ones which are <HI>now</HI> in action, and others which <HI>will</HI> &s;ucceed them, to the end of time.</P>
<P>We who are <HI>now</HI> on the &s;tage, have &s;een &s;o much in <HI>our</HI> day, that, it is hoped, we &s;hall never forget
<PB REF="027629_0006_0FD55500A90D56A0">
"the works of the Lord;" be&s;ides tho&s;e ancient "wonders" which
<Q>we have heard with our ears, and of which our fathers have told us.</Q></P>
<P>It will be proper for us to con&s;ider</P>
<P N="1">I. FIRST, what the&s;e <HI>works of the Lord</HI> are, which we &s;hould remember.</P>
<P N="2">II. What is implied in the <HI>remembrance</HI> of them.</P>
<P N="3">III. The <HI>benefits</HI> which re&s;ult from a due remem|brance of the works of the Lord.</P>
<P N="1">I. We are fir&s;t to con&s;ider what tho&s;e <HI>works of the Lord</HI> are, which demand our devout recollection.</P>
<P>The WORKS of God are great and manifold, and none of them are to be forgotten, or excluded from pious ob&s;ervance. For "ALL <HI>his works prai&s;e him.</HI>" They are all wonderful, and loudly proclaim the glory of their divine Author.&mdash;But when we &s;peak of the <HI>works</HI> of the Lord, they are u&s;ually di&s;tribu|ted under the&s;e three heads&mdash;the work of <HI>creation</HI>&mdash; the works of <HI>providence</HI>&mdash;and his works of <HI>grace.</HI> All the&s;e bear the mo&s;t evident and glorious &s;igna|tures of God.</P>
<P>The work of CREATION exhibits &s;uch a di&s;play of the divine perfections of its Author, as demands the mo&s;t explicit acknowledgement and prai&s;e of all rational intelligences. How a&s;toni&s;hing mu&s;t be the power of that Being, who, by a &s;ingle <HI>act</HI> of his <HI>will,</HI> could cau&s;e this glorious fabrick of the UNI|VERSE, in a moment, to &s;pring from <HI>nothing</HI> into
<PB N="9" REF="027629_0007_0FD555019EB41B80">
exi&s;tence; and in &s;uch beautiful order, grandeur and harmony! How &s;triking and how &s;olemn are tho&s;e words, God &s;aid, "LET there be light, and there WAS light!" "He <HI>&s;pake</HI> and it was <HI>done</HI>&mdash; he commanded, and it &s;tood fa&s;t." How is the &s;erious, reflecting mind &s;truck with amazement, likewi&s;e, at the va&s;t <HI>number,</HI> and almo&s;t infinite <HI>va|riety</HI> of created exi&s;tences, in every part of the uni|ver&s;e! "The heavens" above us, with all their &s;hining train, "declare" in the mo&s;t expre&s;&s;ive language, "the glory of their Creator." "The firmament &s;heweth his handy work." Wherever we turn our eyes, divine <HI>power, wi&s;dom</HI> and <HI>goodne&s;s</HI> meet them. All creatures, animate and inanimate are full of glowing evidences of Deity. Our own <HI>bodies</HI>&mdash;"how fearfully and wonderfully are they made!" Our immortal <HI>&s;ouls</HI> bear a &s;till nearer re|&s;emblance to, and more clearly di&s;play the wi&s;dom and glory of their great Original.&mdash;Thus, by the work of <HI>creation,</HI> and "by the things that are <HI>made,</HI> are to be &s;een and under&s;tood his ETERNAL POWER and GODHEAD."</P>
<P>The works of PROVIDENCE are no le&s;s remarkable, than tho&s;e of creation. Indeed, &s;o nece&s;&s;ary is a DIVINE <HI>power</HI> for the <HI>pre&s;ervation</HI> of the world in exi&s;tence and order, that this has been, and not improperly, called a <HI>continued act of creation.</HI> None but the &s;ame omnipotent hand, which <HI>made</HI> the
<PB N="10" REF="027629_0008_0FD6193DDB162C70">
world, could uphold it, a moment, in being. The con&s;tant <HI>pre&s;ervation</HI> of created exi&s;tence, is there|fore, as &s;trong an argument for the being of a GOD, as the fir&s;t production of them from nothing. It is as much "<HI>in</HI> HIM" and <HI>from</HI> him, that "we <HI>live</HI> and <HI>move,</HI>" as that we "<HI>have our being.</HI>"&mdash;But the <HI>providence</HI> of God, is not only concerned in uphold|ing creation, and continuing all things in being, but in the &s;pecial <HI>ordering</HI> and <HI>directing</HI> all creatures and things, &s;o as to an&s;wer the great and wi&s;e ends for which they were made. And this extends to all things in the <HI>moral,</HI> as well as the <HI>natural</HI> world: and comprehends all <HI>events</HI> which take place in both. Accordingly God is &s;aid to "work all things according to the coun&s;el of his will." And that he hath not only "the <HI>&s;parrow,</HI>" and the <HI>hairs</HI> of our heads, and all <HI>material</HI> things, but even "the <HI>hearts</HI> of all in his hand, and turneth them whither|&s;oever he plea&s;eth, as the rivers of water are turn|ed." And that he "worketh in men, both to <HI>will</HI> and to do, of his own good plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>DAVID ju&s;tly received it as a mo&s;t joyful con&s;ider|ation (and &s;o do all good men) that every thing was under God's direction and controul. That all creatures and all events were entirely and abso|lutely at his di&s;po&s;al. "The <HI>Lord reigneth,</HI> let the <HI>earth rejoice.</HI>" The government of the univer&s;e is in &s;afe hands, becau&s;e in the hands of a Being who is
<PB N="11" REF="027629_0009_0FD61947ED80D978">
infinitely ju&s;t and wi&s;e&mdash;who cannot err, and who will direct all to the be&s;t ends po&s;&s;ible. "The Judge of all the earth will do right"&mdash;however dark many things in providence, may now appear to us. For he is as wi&s;e as he is powerful, and as good as he is wi&s;e.</P>
<P>In con&s;idering <HI>this</HI> part of the &s;ubject, the works of <HI>providence,</HI> a very large field opens to our view; in which, it is my purpo&s;e principally to walk, at this time; and to endeavor to aid our mutual contempla|tions, on &s;o plea&s;ing a theme. And I have no doubt, that before we &s;hall have fini&s;hed our <HI>mental</HI> walk, we &s;hall &s;ee what abundant rea&s;on we have, to unite with the P&s;almi&s;t in the text, and &s;ay,
<Q>we will remember the works of the Lord; &s;urely we will remember his wonders of old.</Q></P>
<P>If the divine PROVIDENCE extend to the &s;malle&s;t, and mo&s;t minute events, as we have heard; how much more to tho&s;e <HI>great</HI> revolutions and tho&s;e important affairs, which have, and which are contin|ually, taking place in the world, in all ages: and e&s;pecially to tho&s;e which more immediately re&s;pect MAN, as the &s;ubject of moral government. But we will pur&s;ue <HI>this path</HI> a little further.&mdash;</P>
<P>In "remembring the works of the Lord," in the government of <HI>providence,</HI> our minds are carried back to the commencement of ages&mdash;to the earlie&s;t dawn of time. For no &s;ooner had JEHOVAH &s;poke crea|tion
<PB N="12" REF="027629_0010_0FD555080765CC80">
into exi&s;tence, but he began to exhibit his own glorious character on its theatre; and to give the mo&s;t clear evidences of his wi&s;dom, goodne&s;s and power, in his conduct towards his new world; and particularly, his noble creature MAN&mdash;the brighte&s;t image of him&s;elf, among all the creatures of this lower world. Here we are led to take a view of the ori|ginal <HI>covenant,</HI> which God made with the fir&s;t father of our race&mdash;His <HI>holy</HI> and <HI>happy</HI> condition, at his fir&s;t formation&mdash;the delightful <HI>&s;ituation</HI> a&s;&s;igned him in the garden of <HI>paradi&s;e</HI>&mdash;and the more delightful <HI>communion</HI> he enjoyed with his Maker, GOD&mdash;in full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his <HI>love,</HI> and of all the joys of <HI>innocence</HI>&mdash; a <HI>&s;tranger</HI> to <HI>want</HI> and <HI>&s;orrow,</HI> becau&s;e a &s;tranger to &s;in.</P>
<P>But, alas! from this plea&s;ing &s;cene, this &s;tate of primitive happine&s;s and moral rectitude, we are led, by the hi&s;tory of <HI>providence,</HI> &s;oon to behold a melan|choly rever&s;e of things&mdash;in that awful cata&s;trophe, pre&s;ented to us, in the guilty <HI>apo&s;tacy</HI> of man from his God, by a tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of his law.&mdash;Thence to the deplorable &s;tate of the whole human race, in con&s;e|quence of his &s;in&mdash;the death and ruin which have overwhelmed the world, "by one man's di&s;obedi|ence," by which, "many were made &s;inners."</P>
<P>But in the mid&s;t of this &s;cene of darkne&s;s, and woe, we are led to behold the fir&s;t <HI>beam of hope,</HI> which &s;hone upon this ruined world, in the gracious <HI>promi&s;e</HI>
<PB N="13" REF="027629_0011_0FD5550922E2C558">
of a SAVIOUR, under the character of "<HI>the &s;eed of the woman.</HI>"&mdash;In further looking into the records of <HI>providence,</HI> we are carried on to view the &s;ad effects of the apo&s;tacy of man, in the dreadful <HI>de&s;truction of the old world,</HI> by a univer&s;al flood of water, for their daring wickedne&s;s, and their awful defection from God.&mdash;After this, to the divine kindne&s;s to NOAH, in pre&s;erving him and his hou&s;hold from the common de&s;olation, by means of an <HI>ark</HI>; precious emblem of that glorious <HI>&s;anctuary</HI>&mdash;that <HI>ark</HI> of &s;afety, JESUS CHRIST&mdash;the only "hiding-place" for guilty &s;inners, from a more terrible flood of divine indignation, coming upon all the finally impenitent.&mdash;Thence we are led to &s;ee the exemplary vengeance which fell on the devoted cities of <HI>SODOM</HI> and <HI>Gomorrah,</HI> which were
<Q>turned into a&s;hes, and condemned with an overthrow, for an example to tho&s;e, who, after, &s;hould live ungodly.</Q>
&mdash;With plea&s;ing wonder, we then contemplate God's gracious calling of <HI>Abraham,</HI> and his di&s;tingui&s;hed regard to this Father of the faithful, and to his <HI>&s;eed</HI> after him&mdash;The miraculous pre&s;ervation of <HI>Mo&s;es</HI>; and his call and commi&s;&s;ion to be the me&s;&s;enger of God's mercy to his afflicted people, and the in&s;trument of their deliverance from bondage.&mdash;Thence we come to the amazing &s;tory of the hardened <HI>monarch of Egypt</HI> who
<Q>knew not the Lord, nor would he</Q>
though at Heaven's order, "let I&s;rael go:" And who&s;e &s;ignal obduracy would
<PB N="14" REF="027629_0012_0FD5550CA5D4E7F0">
not be overcome by all the <HI>plagues</HI> of Egypt.&mdash; From thence to the final <HI>re&s;cue</HI> of the armies of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> from his oppre&s;&s;ive hands&mdash;The in&s;titution of the <HI>pa&s;&s;over,</HI> an in&s;tructive rite, to be ob&s;erved in grateful commemoration of their deliverance&mdash; Their di&s;tre&s;s, &s;oon after at the <HI>Red &s;ea</HI>&mdash;Their miracu|lous <HI>e&s;cape</HI> from their enraged enemies&mdash;the <HI>&s;ong of prai&s;e,</HI> they then &s;ung, and their <HI>&s;eeming gratitude</HI> to their God, for this &s;ignal &s;alvation&mdash;but&mdash;their &s;peedy <HI>revolt,</HI> and awful
<Q><HI>murmuring</HI> again&s;t the Lord and his &s;ervant Mo&s;es.</Q>
&mdash;The <HI>anger</HI> of God again&s;t their ingratitude, and yet his a&s;toni&s;hing <HI>patience</HI> towards them, under all their rebellion&mdash;Their long wanderings a 40 years journey, in the wilderne&s;s&mdash; where thou&s;ands of their carca&s;es fell, for their unbe|lief&mdash;Their &s;afe arrival at la&s;t, and their happy &s;ettle|ment in the land of <HI>Canaan,</HI> the Lord "driving out, by little and little, the Heathen nations, and thus fulfil|ing his promi&s;e made 400 years before, to <HI>Abraham</HI> their FOREFATHER.&mdash;</P>
<P>THESE, which I have but briefly hinted at, are &s;ome of tho&s;e "<HI>works of the Lord</HI>" which belong to his <HI>providential</HI> government of men&mdash;and the&s;e are "<HI>the wonders of old,</HI>" which ought to be remembered with devout acknowledgment and prai&s;e to God.</P>
<P>But be&s;ides the&s;e, the Lord, "who&s;e hand is not &s;hortened," hath wrought great and <HI>marvellous works</HI> in PROVIDENCE, towards <HI>other</HI> nations and people; and
<PB N="15" REF="027629_0013_0FD6193F788D10E8">
that, in every &s;ucce&s;&s;ive generation, down to the pre&s;ent eventful period. And we may ju&s;tly view, as none of the lea&s;t of the&s;e, the great and a&s;toni&s;hing events, which have taken place in our <HI>own land,</HI> within eighteen years pa&s;t&mdash;and which have been attended with <HI>con&s;equences,</HI> &s;o important not only to <HI>this</HI> country, but to <HI>others,</HI> and mo&s;t probably, will be in the event, to all the nations of the world. To the revolution in <HI>America,</HI> as a <HI>mean,</HI> in the hand of providence, may probably, be a&s;cribed, the &s;urpri|&s;ing &s;cenes which are acting on the <HI>European</HI> Conti|nent at the pre&s;ent day; where
<Q>the nations, like a <HI>potters ve&s;&s;el,</HI> are <HI>da&s;hing to pieces,</HI></Q>
one again&s;t another. The pre&s;ent period appears to be big with as important events, as ever the world has witne&s;&s;ed, as it re&s;pects the <HI>political</HI> &s;tate of mankind; and I believe, ultimately, the <HI>moral</HI> &s;tate too.&mdash;The grand conte&s;t between <HI>freedom</HI> and <HI>tyranny&mdash;liberty</HI> and <HI>&s;lavery,</HI> is carried on with amazing ardour&mdash;with the mo&s;t ob&s;tinate re&s;olution. And the event mu&s;t be, &s;oon, either glorious or dreadful.&mdash;But it is a &s;weet and quieting con&s;olation to the friends of religion, that "the <HI>Lord God omnipotent reigns</HI>"&mdash;that events are entirely in his hands&mdash;That he &s;itteth upon the circle of the earth, and the inhabitants thereof are as gra&s;shoppers&mdash;that he bringeth the PRINCES to <HI>noth|ing,</HI> he maketh the JUDGES of the earth as <HI>vanity.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I&s;ai. xl.22.</NOTE>
<PB N="16" REF="027629_0014_0FD619443135AFD0">
And it is matter of un&s;peakable thankfulne&s;s and &s;atisfaction that God is the unalterable friend of righteou&s;ne&s;s, and "abhorreth the oppre&s;&s;or and evil doer." And that, "wherein any deal <HI>proudly,</HI> the Lord is above them."</P>
<P>It was ob&s;erved ju&s;t now, that the&s;e great revolu|tions in <HI>providence,</HI> will, mo&s;t likely, produce great changes in the <HI>moral</HI> as well as political &s;tate of the world.&mdash;It &s;eems to have been, for a number of years pa&s;t, my brethren, the evident de&s;ign of Heaven, by the&s;e convul&s;ions and overturnings in the world, to bring on, or at lea&s;t, to prepare the way for u&s;hering in tho&s;e glorious and important events, which are &s;o frequently foretold in &s;cripture, re&s;pecting the ad|vancement of the cau&s;e of truth and righteou&s;ne&s;s&mdash; the more univer&s;al &s;pread of the go&s;pel, and the enlargement of the kingdom of our divine Redeemer on earth&mdash;when "the kingdom of this world &s;hall be given to Chri&s;t&mdash;and all the ends of the earth &s;hall &s;ee and rejoice in his &s;alvation.&mdash;And when the Lord &s;hall <HI>build up Zion,</HI> he will appear in his GLORY."&mdash;</P>
<P>But to return&mdash;among other various "works of the Lord" in <HI>providence,</HI> let us, on this occa&s;ion&punc; more particularly look into the hi&s;tory, of our <HI>own country,</HI> and this day call to "remembrance, tho&s;e wonders of old" which the Lord wrought for our
<PB N="17" REF="027629_0015_0FD61945257CD8F8">
<HI>pious progenitors,</HI> who&s;e <HI>bodies</HI> lie mingled with the <HI>du&s;t,</HI> in THIS PLACE, where we <HI>their children</HI> dwell&mdash; but who&s;e <HI>&s;ouls,</HI> have long time no doubt been <HI>at re&s;t</HI> with GOD.</P>
<P>As, in the <HI>fir&s;t di&s;covery</HI> of AMERICA, the hand of God was mo&s;t vi&s;ibly &s;een, and ought forever to be remembered with gratitude&mdash;&s;o, it has evidently been the object of the peculiar care of Heaven, through every &s;ucce&s;&s;ive period of time, to the <HI>pre&s;ent day.</HI> It &s;eems to have been, from the beginning, a remarkable <HI>Theatre</HI> of great and a&s;toni&s;hing "works of the Lord." Our hi&s;tory, from the <HI>fir&s;t landing</HI> of our FATHERS in this town, has been a hi&s;tory of wonders; and will furni&s;h, to every generation, per|haps, as much matter for pious reflection and grati|tude, as that of any nation or people that ever exi&s;ted on earth. That of the children of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> &s;eems the neare&s;t to re&s;emble it: as any one may ob&s;erve, who is acquainted with them both.</P>
<P>I propo&s;e here, agreeably to the words of our text, to give a brief narration of &s;ome of "the wonderful works of God, towards our <HI>ance&s;tors,</HI> which we, their po&s;terity, ought to remember," and which, it is peculiarly proper, we &s;hould call to mind, on this <HI>anniver&s;ary.</HI> In doing this, although the accounts chiefly mu&s;t be derived nece&s;&s;arily from hi&s;torical facts, the &s;ub&s;tance of which &s;ome of you, perhaps, may have been already acquainted with&mdash;yet, I &s;hall

bring to your view, <HI>&s;ome</HI> circum&s;tances&mdash;&s;ome an|cient anecdotes, which, I pre&s;ume, have never yet been made public, at lea&s;t, which I have never &s;een. I &s;hall take them from the fir&s;t book of the very an|cient <HI>records</HI> of this church, now in my hands.

<Q>once knew them, to be &s;tirred up by way of <HI>remembrance.</HI></Q></P>
<P>I would begin, by ob&s;erving to you, that the mov|ing cau&s;e of our <HI>fathers</HI> leaving ENGLAND, their native land, and tran&s;planting them&s;elves, finally, in the&s;e then "dark corners of the earth," was, the cruel per&s;ecution and religious oppre&s;&s;ion, they met with in their own land: originating in a &s;pirit of intoler|ance which then prevailed, e&s;pecially in the <HI>Epi&s;copal</HI> hierarchy; a &s;pirit, now abhorred, as much by the enlightened and pious members of <HI>that</HI> communion, as perhaps by any others whatever; and which is viewed as a mi&s;erable relick of ancient popi&s;h &s;u|per&s;tition and bigotry. Our <HI>fathers</HI> were not indul|ged the rea&s;onable liberty of wor&s;hipping their God agreeably to their own con&s;ciences. And though they made no di&s;turbance in the State, but were peaceable members of &s;ociety, yet becau&s;e they could not, in con&s;cience, &s;ubmit to un&s;criptural im|po&s;itions, nor bow their necks to the yoke of human

inventions, they were loaded with heavy fines and for|feitures&mdash;nay, hunted about like "partridges on the mountains," and per&s;ecuted as pe&s;ts to &s;ociety. And merely for exerci&s;ing that Chri&s;tian liberty, which Chri&s;t hath given them, they were &s;eized and many of them impri&s;oned&mdash;others had their hou&s;es be&s;et, and watched night and day, and with difficulty e&s;caped their hands; and mo&s;t of them were obliged to fly and leave their habitations, and all means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence.</P>
<P>Under the&s;e burdens they groaned for a con&s;ider|able time, but &s;till continued, as they had done, to meet as often as they could for the wor&s;hip of God, (though privately for fear of their enemies) under the pa&s;toral care of that famous and learned divine, Mr. <HI>John Robin&s;on,</HI> the FIRST PASTOR of this ANCIENT CHURCH: until at length, their burdens became intolerable; and they, by joint con&s;ent, re&s;olve to fly their native country, and &s;eek an a&s;ylum in <HI>Holland,</HI> where they had heard, was a gen|eral toleration given to all denominations of Chri&s;t|ians; and where &s;ome of their own countrymen had gone before, under like troubles. The undertaking, they knew, was hazardous, and likely to be attend|ed with great expence and difficulty. For their enemies watched them continually, and would do every thing in their power to prevent their e&s;cape. What a dreadful &s;ituation! They can neither be

&s;uffered to live at home, in peace, nor to go abroad for it. The ports and harbours are watched: &s;trict orders given by authority, not to &s;uffer them to e&s;cape. They are obliged to u&s;e the mo&s;t private methods po&s;&s;ible, and give extravagant fees to the &s;ailors&mdash;and yet were often betrayed by them. Twice they attempted to remove, and though with the utmo&s;t po&s;&s;ible privacy, yet they were di&s;cover|ed before they could get away.&mdash;One in&s;tance of this, I find, which is very affecting, and which I &s;hall here mention, in the words of the records.</P>
<P>"There was a large companie of them purpo&s;ed to gett pa&s;&s;age att <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> in Lincoln&s;hire, for HOL|LAND; and for that end, had hiered a &s;hip wholly to them&s;elves, and made agreement with the ma&s;ter, to be ready att a certaine day, and take them and theire goods in at a convenient place appointed; where they all, accordingly, attended in reddine&s;s. After longe waiting, and large expences, the ma&s;ter, th&ocirc; he kept not his word as to the <HI>day,</HI> yett came at la&s;t, and tooke them in, in the night&mdash;and when hee had got them and theire goods aboard, he betrayed them; having before-hand, complotted with the &s;earchers and other officers &s;oe to doe, whoe took them and putt them into open boates, and there rifled and ran&s;acked them, &s;earching them to theire &s;hirts for money&mdash;" offering the mo&s;t brutal violence

<P>Thus their de&s;ign is broken up, and they come off with lo&s;s, indignity and &s;hame.</P>
<P>The next year, however, they made another at|tempt, though with little better &s;ucce&s;s than the former. There are &s;ome circum&s;tances attending <HI>this</HI> al&s;o, which are &s;o very peculiar and affecting, that it may not be ami&s;s to give a particular account of them, which I &s;hall do likewi&s;e, nearly in the words of the records.</P>
<P>"The&s;e adventurers, not willing to tru&s;t their own countrymen the <HI>&s;econd</HI> time, after they had met with &s;uch ba&s;e treatment from them, heard of a <HI>Dutch</HI> &s;hipma&s;ter at <HI>Hull,</HI> having a &s;hip of his own, belonging to ZEALAND. They made an agreement with him, and acquainted him with their condi|tion and de&s;ign, hoping to find more friend&s;hip in him, than in tho&s;e of their own nation. He bad them not fear, for he would do well enough. He was, by appointment, to take them in between <HI>Grim&s;ley</HI> and <HI>Hull,</HI> where was a large <HI>common,</HI> a good way di&s;|tant from any town. Now again&s;t the time pre|fixed, that they might be in le&s;s danger of being di&s;covered, they divide their company, and &s;end on

the <HI>women</HI> and <HI>children,</HI> with the goods, to the place fir&s;t, in a &s;mall <HI>barque,</HI> which they had hired for that purpo&s;e. And the <HI>men</HI> were to go by land and meet them there, at the day appointed. But it &s;o fell out, that they were all at the place, a day or two before the &s;hip came. When &s;he arrived, they found the <HI>barque,</HI> with the women, &amp;c. aground, near the &s;hore, it being low water. The &s;hipma&s;|ter perceiving this, in order to lo&s;e no time, &s;ent his boat to take the <HI>men</HI> aboard, whom he &s;aw walking along the &s;hore. But after the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> boat|ful was got aboard, and &s;he was ready to go for more, they lift up their eyes, and behold a large company of hor&s;e and footmen coming with full &s;peed upon them. For by &s;ome treachery, their enemies had got notice of it, and the whole country thereabout was rai&s;ed to take them. The men on the &s;hore, had ju&s;t time, by flight, to e&s;cape their pur&s;uers.&mdash;But think, reader, of the &s;orrowful fate of the poor, piteous <HI>mothers</HI> and <HI>children</HI> in the <HI>barque,</HI> who fall a prey into their mercile&s;s hands!

A terrible &s;torm comes on, in their pa&s;&s;age, which continued for &s;even days and nights together, in which they &s;aw neither &s;un, moon nor &s;tars, and were driven to the coa&s;t of <HI>Norway.</HI> At length it increa&s;ed to &s;uch violence, that all hopes of life &s;eemed gone&mdash;the mariners them&s;elves de&s;pairing of ever &s;eeing land.

then the Lord's power and mercy appeared.

And now, in a &s;hort time, they arrive at their de&s;ired haven, where the people come flocking about them, being amazed at their deliverance."

<P>Let us now return to the &s;cattered company that were left on the Engli&s;h &s;hore. The mo&s;t of them, as we have ob&s;erved before, made &s;hift to e&s;cape and hide them&s;elves from their pur&s;uers&mdash;a few only tar|rying in order to afford, if po&s;&s;ible, &s;ome little com|fort to the women and children. But pitiful it was, indeed, to &s;ee the condition of the&s;e poor creatures. What weeping and crying on every &s;ide&mdash;&s;ome for
<PB N="25" REF="027629_0023_0FD555205C9BC6B8">
their hu&s;bands, who were carried away in the &s;hip&mdash; others melted in tears to &s;ee their poor <HI>little ones</HI> hanging about them, crying for fear, and quaking with the cold. Being thus apprehended, they are hurried away from one place to another, and from one ju&s;tice to another; until, in the end, they know not what to do with them. To impri&s;on &s;o many women and innocent children for no other crime or cau&s;e than their being obliged to go with their hu&s;|bands, &s;eemed to be unrea&s;onable, and they knew, all would cry out again&s;t them. And to &s;end them home again, was as difficult; for, as the truth was, they alledged, they <HI>had</HI> no homes to go to; for they had &s;old, and otherwi&s;e di&s;po&s;ed of their hou&s;es and livings. In &s;hort, after they had been thus '<HI>tur|moiled</HI>' and harra&s;&s;ed a long time, and conveyed from one con&s;table to another, the officers being weary'd out, were glad, in the end, to get rid of them on any terms.</P>
<P>A pious <HI>remark</HI> is made here, in our records, worthy of notice, which I give, as there recorded.&mdash; The writer &s;ays,</P>
<P><Q>I may not omit the fruite that came heerby; for by the&s;e foe publicke troubles, in &s;oe many eminent places, theire cau&s;e became famous, and occationed many to looke into the &s;ame.

And altho &s;ome few &s;hrunke att tho&s;e fir&s;t conflicts and &s;harp beginninges, (as it was noe marvell,) yett many more came on with ffre&s;he corrage, and greatly anymated others. And in the end, notwith&s;tanding all the&s;e &s;tormes of op|&s;ition, they all gott over to <HI>Hollande</HI> at length, &s;ome att one time, and &s;ome att another, and mett together againe accordinge to theire hearts de&s;ires, with noe &s;mall rejoiceing.</Q></P>
<P>They, having thus arrived, mini&s;ter and people, to a land, though of &s;trangers, yet, of peace and liberty, &s;tayed the fir&s;t year at <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> a large city, full of trade and people. But on account of &s;ome unhappy di&s;putes and contentions of a religious nature, that prevailed there at that time, which had well nigh ruined <HI>Mr. Smith</HI>'s church, who had gone over thither from England before them, they pru|dently re&s;olved, in &s;ea&s;on, to remove, le&s;t the con|tagion &s;hould &s;pread among <HI>them</HI> al&s;o. They accordingly, did remove to <HI>Leyden,</HI> a city about 20 miles &s;outh of <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> where they were kindly received, and here they &s;ettle them&s;elves, and live, in the greate&s;t harmony, as brethren, for about <HI>eleven years</HI>; where they enjoyed much com|fort, under the mini&s;try of their beloved and faithful pa&s;tor, <HI>Mr. Robin&s;on.</HI> It &s;eemed like a kind of heavenly re&s;t to them, after the &s;torms and troubles they had pa&s;&s;ed through. For here they
<Q>walked in the fear of the Lord, and in the comfort of the
<PB N="27" REF="027629_0025_0FD619566EAE4970">
Holy Gho&s;t, and were edified.</Q>
And here many more were added to them. For the flames of relig|ious tyranny and per&s;ecution continued &s;o to increa&s;e in <HI>England,</HI> that many more fled over to them, for the &s;ake of enjoying liberty and the rights of con&s;cience. So that they became a very large congregation.</P>
<P>But time and changes render every thing uncer|tain, even our mo&s;t precious enjoyments, in this world. And they found, at length, that this place was not to be their "continuing city." There were a number of things concurred as rea&s;ons for their removal to &s;ome other place or country&mdash;the hard|ne&s;s of the land&mdash;the difficulty of getting a living from it, and the dearne&s;s of provi&s;ions&mdash;The&s;e were very di&s;couraging to them, and cau&s;ed many of their children to leave them and become &s;oldiers or &s;ailors, to the great grief of their parents. Be&s;ides, the im|morality and loo&s;e way of living among that people, e&s;pecially the prophanation of the &s;abbath, &s;et|ting a bad example to their children&mdash;was very griev|ous. But above all, the de&s;ired hope they had of &s;preading the go&s;pel of <HI>CHRIST,</HI> and laying a founda|tion for the advancement of religion and the king|dom of <HI>CHRIST</HI> in this remote part of the world.&mdash; <HI>The&s;e,</HI> were &s;ome of the chief rea&s;ons which induced our ance&s;tors to determine on a removal from <HI>Holland.</HI></P>
<P>Accordingly, previous to &s;o great an undertaking, and agreeably to their pious character, they fir&s;t of all,

&s;et apart a day for <HI>prayer,</HI> to &s;eek <HI>direction</HI> from God, in the important affair now under con&s;ideration. That &s;criptural direction being always their maxim,
<Q>In all thy ways acknowledge GOD, and <HI>he</HI> will direct thy paths.</Q>
And after due deliberation, they come to a re&s;olution of removing to <HI>America</HI>; and accord|ingly &s;et about the nece&s;&s;ary preparations for it. They make application to the king, for permi&s;&s;ion to go under the royal &s;anction, but are refu&s;ed. They renew their reque&s;t, and endeavour to engage &s;ome of the great men of the nation, to aid their cau&s;e. Sometimes they meet with encouragement, and again are di&s;appointed. Some &s;peak well of them, others mi&s;repre&s;ent and villify them; and thus they are to&s;&s;ed between hope and fear&mdash;&s;pend a great deal of time, are at va&s;t expence and labour, until, at la&s;t, they gained their point &s;o far, as that they are encouraged to make preparations for their voyage.</P>
<P>They hired two &s;hips for the purpo&s;e, concluded upon the number who &s;hould go over fir&s;t; for all could not go at this time. And as the major part of the company tarried behind, their <HI>pa&s;tor</HI> &s;tay|ed with them. While the others, with their pious <HI>elder,</HI> Mr. BREWSTER, prepare to embark. And now comes on another mo&s;t trying &s;cene, viz. their <HI>parting.</HI> This is almo&s;t too affecting to think of, when we con&s;ider the cordial love and unanimity which bound them together, as with the tendere&s;t
<PB N="29" REF="027629_0027_0FD55528F1A50F88">
cord. This, &s;till more &s;trengthened by the mutual &s;orrows and di&s;tre&s;&s;es they had gone through&mdash;con|&s;idering al&s;o what dangers on the &s;ea they were going to encounter&mdash;and that, like <HI>Abraham</HI> of old, they were "going they know not whither," into a new world&mdash;and e&s;pecially, as this would probably be, as it was, a <HI>final</HI> parting, with many of them. The&s;e con&s;iderations &s;erved to make this a mo&s;t affecting occa&s;ion to them all.</P>
<P>But before they &s;eparate, they conclude to &s;pend one day more together in religious devotion, as a day of <HI>humiliation</HI> and <HI>prayer.</HI> On this occa&s;ion, be&s;ides pouring out their &s;ouls to the Lord in fer|vent prayer, &s;upplications and tears, Mr. ROBINSON preached to them, from tho&s;e words in EZRA viii.21.
<Q>Then I proclaimed a FAST there, at the river AHAVA, <HI>that we might afflict our&s;elves there before GOD,</HI> to &s;eek of him a right way for US, and for our LITTLE ONES, and for all our &s;ub&s;tance.</Q>
&mdash;"And now, the trying time being come, that they mu&s;t depart, (&s;ay the records) they were accompany'd by mo&s;t of their brethren out of the city, into a town called <HI>Half-Haven,</HI> where the &s;hip lay readye to receive them. So they left that goodlye and plea&s;ant city, which had been theire re&s;ting-place, near twelve yeeres. But they knew they were <HI>pilgrimes,</HI> and looked not much on tho&s;e things, but lifted up theire eyes to Heaven, theire deare&s;t country, and quieted

their &s;pirits. When they came to the place, they found the &s;hip, and all thinges readye. That night was &s;pent with little &s;leep by mo&s;t, but with chri&s;tian di&s;cour&s;e and other like real expre&s;&s;ions of true chri&s;tian love. The next day, the wind being faire, they went aboard, their friends accompanying them &mdash;but truly doleful was the &s;ight of that &s;ad partinge &mdash;to &s;ee what <HI>&s;ythes</HI> and <HI>&s;obbes,</HI> and prayers did &s;ound among them, what teares did gu&s;h from every eye, and expre&s;&s;ions which &s;oe pier&s;ed each others harte, that &s;undrye of the Dutch &s;trangers that &s;tood on the Kees as &s;pectators, could not refraine from teares.

and finally they are obliged to leave her behind, with a number of their companions who had embarked in her.

The &s;ame GOD protected our <HI>fathers,</HI> while they cheerfully commit them&s;elves, under his care, to the boi&s;terous element, in &s;earch of an unknown land.

<P>"But Oh! how horrid and di&s;mal, do the&s;e new-found regions appear! on the rivers and &s;hores, nothing but &s;ights of wretched, naked and barbarous &s;avages, adorers of devils&mdash;the earth covered with hideous thickets, which will require infinite toil to &s;ubdue&mdash;a cold winter for a third part of the year&mdash; no friends to welcome them&mdash;no inns to entertain or refre&s;h them, no hou&s;es, much le&s;s towns to repair unto, to &s;eek for &s;uccour.&mdash;It is recorded in &s;crip|ture, as a great mercy to the apo&s;tle Paul and his &s;hipwrecked companions, that

But 'tis evident the whole de&s;ign was of God, and he was determined to compleat it&mdash;for, "as for GOD, his way is perfect."</P>
<P>They arrived at <HI>Cape-Cod,</HI> Nov. 10th. 1620, where, on their bended knees, they, fir&s;t of all, give
<PB N="33" REF="027629_0031_0FD619630B5CB100">
thanks to their guardian God, for his kind protec|tion over them through a long and dangerous voyage. In the next place, they wi&s;ely formed a &s;ett of laws and regulations, for the well ordering of the compa|ny, and enter into, and &s;ign a &s;olemn contract before they went a&s;hore; and this was the foundation of their <HI>civil government.</HI>&mdash;The whole number belonging to their company, great and &s;mall, was 101 &s;ouls. One, indeed, had died on their pa&s;&s;age, but they had anoth|er born at &s;ea, &s;o that the &s;ame number arrived, that embarked in England.</P>
<P>And now they enter upon a new &s;cene. Though pa&s;t the dangers of the &s;eas, yet there are other, and greater difficulties to &s;urmount, before they can gain a peaceable &s;ettlement. They are wholly unac|quainted with the country. They find the place where they fir&s;t landed, by no means &s;uitable for them. They travel with their arms in their hands, from place to place, through wet and cold, in this late &s;ea&s;on of the year&mdash;often, for days and nights, lying expo&s;ed, in the wilderne&s;s, to the open air and in|clement &s;ky. And to add to their affliction, the <HI>master</HI> of the &s;hip grows impatient and fretful&mdash; threatens that if they do not &s;peedily find a place for &s;ettlement, he will turn their families, goods and effects upon the naked &s;hore. The <HI>Indians,</HI> &s;everal times, &s;urprize and fall upon them with their bows and arrows, which pierce their <HI>clothes</HI>&mdash;but their
<PB N="34" REF="027629_0032_0FD55531340CAD30">
God &s;uffered them not to touch their <HI>lives.</HI>&mdash;After many days &s;pent in a fruitle&s;s &s;earch for a convenient place, they at length, conclude, by the advice of one of their company, to come in que&s;t of <HI>this harbour.</HI> And he engages, (having touched here once before, in a voyage of di&s;covery) to be their Pilot. They accordingly man their boat for the enterprize, with &s;ome of their principal men, and &s;et out.</P>
<P>The particular circum&s;tances of this affair, having &s;o immediate a connexion with this anniver&s;ary oc|ca&s;ion, although minute, yet may be deemed worthy of recital&mdash;which I &s;hall give in the words of the writer.</P>
<P><Q>They are now in the Bay, in a &s;mall &s;hallop. After &s;ome hours &s;ailing, it begins to &s;now and rain. It is now <HI>Friday</HI> afternoon. The wind ri&s;es, and blows with great violence. The &s;ea grows rough&mdash; they brake their rudder. It is as much as two men can do to &s;teer her with oars. The &s;torm increa|&s;es, and night coming on, they carrying what &s;ail they can, to get into the harbour, broke their ma&s;t in three pieces&mdash;their &s;ails fall overboard, in a very grown &s;ea, and they are like to founder &s;uddenly. Yet, by the mercy of Heaven, they recover, and the flood being with them, they &s;trike into the <HI>&s;up|po&s;ed</HI> harbour. But the pilot was deceived&mdash;and cries out, "Lord be merciful, my eyes never &s;aw

this place before."&mdash;They, with &s;ome difficulty, get her about &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, and providence &s;hewing a fair &s;ound before them, though very dark and rainy, they get under the lee of a &s;mall i&s;land, in our harbour, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Called <HI>Clark's Island,</HI> from the man who fir&s;t &s;tepped a&s;hore.</NOTE> but are &s;till divided about going a&s;hore, le&s;t they fall into the midst of &s;avages. Some keep the boat&mdash;but others, worn out with wet, cold and fatigue, venture a&s;hore, and with great difficulty kindle a fire. After midnight, the wind &s;hifting, and the weather growing very cold, the re&s;t are glad to get to them; and here they &s;tay that night. In the morning they di&s;covered it to be an i&s;land, &s;ecure from Indians; and it being the la&s;t day of the week, here they dry their clothes, re&s;t them&s;elves, and give thanks to God for their many deliverances.</Q></P>
<P>And here, I find, the next day, they kept the Chri&s;tian &s;abbath, being about 20 in number. The <HI>fir&s;t &s;abbath</HI> ever ob&s;erved in a religious manner, in this town, and in this part of the world.</P>
<P>The next day, they proceeded to &s;ound out the harbour, find it commodious for their purpo&s;e, came a&s;hore at <HI>this place</HI>&mdash;found &s;everal running brooks and old <HI>cornfields,</HI> but no inhabitants: a dreadful <HI>plague,</HI> as they were afterwards informed, having broke out among the <HI>Indians</HI> in this place, a little
<PB N="36" REF="027629_0034_0FD555349EE02CC0">
before, which carried off the inhabitants. Thus divine providence, in a &s;ignal manner &s;eemed to go before them, to prepare a place for them.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, they judge this a &s;uitable &s;pot for &s;ettlement; and return to the &s;hip at the <HI>Cape,</HI> with the news of their di&s;covery, to the re&s;t of their compan|ions. Upon which, the &s;hip &s;ails for this harbour; where our worthy and pious ANCESTORS, in this month <HI>December,</HI> and on this day of the month, as our history dates it, <HI>ju&s;t</HI> 173 <HI>years ago,</HI> here, on <HI>this very &s;pot</HI> which we now inhabit, began their &s;ettle|ment.</P>
<P>It would take up more time than is alloted for the pre&s;ent di&s;cour&s;e, to attempt a further enumeration of the many hard&s;hips they endured the following winter, and afterwards; by hunger and cold, by open enemies, and fal&s;e friends, here and abroad; as well as by wa&s;ting &s;ickne&s;s; by which, <HI>more than half</HI> their number were carry'd off, within a year after their landing.</P>
<P>It may &s;uffice to have comply'd with the particu|ular de&s;ign of this di&s;cour&s;e; which was, to give a brief account of &s;ome of the <HI>principal</HI> occurrences, relating to our <HI>forefathers,</HI> until their <HI>landing</HI> in this place. I will only ob&s;erve in general, that as the fir&s;t &s;ettlers of this country, evidently, were actuated, not by worldly motives, but by tho&s;e of religion

and con&s;cience, by an ardent zeal for the glory of God&mdash;the pure wor&s;hip and unadulterated doctrines of the go&s;pel; and an earne&s;t de&s;ire, <HI>them&s;elves</HI> of enjoying, and leaving to their <HI>children</HI> the enjoyment of tho&s;e rights and liberties which God had given them; &s;o it has remarkably appeared that a peculiar ble&s;&s;ing of heaven has followed them and their po&s;|terity, in that this land has been the &s;pecial care of God's kind and gracious providence, from genera|tion to generation down to our day. And although their de&s;cendants have been called to witne&s;s &s;ome &s;cenes of di&s;tre&s;s and trouble; and enemies of various de&s;criptions, and in various ways, have ri&s;en up again&s;t us; and at certain periods, we have &s;eemed to be threatened with de&s;truction; yet the Lord God of our <HI>fathers</HI> hath from time to time appeared in a mo&s;t wonderful manner, for our deliverance. He hath
<Q>&s;aved us by his right hand, and his holy arm hath gotten us the victory.</Q>
So that we have had occa&s;ion to

works of love and power, of wi&s;dom and grace, which employ the inqui&s;itive minds of holy angels, who "de&s;ire to look into them," and are filled with heavenly admiration when they behold them. <HI>The&s;e</HI> are the works which will employ the prai&s;es of unnumbered myriads of the "redeemed from among men," to all eternity.

<P>It is worthy of particular remembrance, that this country had been di&s;covered <HI>a hundred and ten years</HI> before their arrival here, and before any effec|tual
<PB N="45" REF="027629_0043_0FD6197F2D69AFC8">
&s;ettlements were made in it. Several attempts had, indeed, been formed with this view, but they were by per&s;ons who appear to have been actuated merely from worldly motives, and mercenary views; and their de&s;igns were all bla&s;ted by the hand of providence&mdash;They met with a &s;eries of cro&s;&s;es of one kind and another, till they gave over the attempt.

<P>A per&s;on mu&s;t be a great &s;tranger to the character and hi&s;tory of our <HI>fathers,</HI> who does not know <HI>the&s;e</HI> were their avowed &s;entiments and principles, as to the <HI>doctrines</HI> of religion. <HI>The&s;e</HI> were truths, dearer to them than their e&s;tates&mdash;yea, than life it&s;elf. And
<PB N="48" REF="027629_0046_0FD6198365CB7210">
they are but the <HI>&s;ame</HI> doctrines which have been held and preached by the mo&s;t famous PROTESTANT DI|VINES in <HI>England, Scotland</HI> and <HI>America,</HI> &s;ince the REFORMATION from popery. <HI>Divines</HI> as eminent for learning and piety, perhaps, as ever adorned the Chri&s;tian world.</P>
<P>And, in this connexion, I may ob&s;erve farther, without impropriety&mdash;That it is not a little remark|able, that through the &s;ingular goodne&s;s and watchful care of divine providence towards the <HI>children</HI> of our <HI>forefathers, the&s;e &s;ame doctrines</HI> have, invariably, from generation to generation, been preached in <HI>this town,</HI> the fear of our ance&s;tors, with becoming boldne&s;s, zeal and affection, by <HI>all my predece&s;&s;ors in office,</HI> who now "re&s;t from their labors, and their works follow them."&mdash;And if I may take the liberty, I will hum|bly add&mdash;that <HI>the&s;e</HI> great and infinitely important truths, I have <HI>endeavoured,</HI> according to my capacity, to preach and declare, with all plainne&s;s, to <HI>you</HI>&mdash; to your <HI>fathers</HI> and to your <HI>children.</HI> For the truth of this, I hope I have a witne&s;s in your own brea&s;ts. &mdash;And as I am bound to "watch for your &s;ouls, as one that must give an account," &s;o I am determined, by the grace of Chri&s;t enabling me, &s;till to declare them to you. And, as I hope to live and die in the belief and comfort of them, my&s;elf&mdash;as I am &s;atisfi|ed they have been a &s;weet &s;upport to many of <HI>your</HI> and <HI>my</HI> departed friends, in a dying hour, and their

<HI>only</HI> ground of hope&mdash;&s;o I am fully per&s;uaded they are the only foundation, on which <HI>we</HI> can leave the world in peace.

<P N="5">5thly. Our &s;ubject naturally reminds us of the peculiar obligations we are under to "remember" with highe&s;t prai&s;e and gratitude the <HI>works of grace,</HI> which God hath wrought&mdash;the wonderful work of <HI>re|demption</HI> by Je&s;us Chri&s;t&mdash;the application of it by the Holy Spirit, in the conver&s;ion of &s;inners from age to age; bringing them out of the dark, mi&s;era|ble and wretched kingdom of Satan, into the king|dom of the Lord Je&s;us&mdash;&s;ubduing the enmity of their minds, and bringing them to a cordial reconcil|iation to God. Thankfully &s;hould we "remember, likewi&s;e, all tho&s;e gracious &s;ea&s;ons of <HI>revival</HI> of <HI>reli|gion,</HI> by the out-pouring of the &s;pirit of God, where|by poor &s;inners are delivered from the cruel bondage of the Devil, and vindicated into the glorious liberty of the children of God." And while &s;peaking on this &s;ubject, I might ju&s;tly be chargeable with crimi|nal ingratitude, &s;hould I neglect to mention, with deep humility and thankfulne&s;s, the wonderful work of God's grace and power which we in <HI>this place</HI> have witne&s;&s;ed the year pa&s;t. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the Appendix.</NOTE> We humbly hope
<PB N="50" REF="027629_0048_0FD6198533AE54D8">
and tru&s;t, that through the infinite mercy of God, many have experienced that divine, renewing <HI>work of grace</HI> upon their hearts, which they will "remember" with grateful prai&s;es to all eternity. May their hope "<HI>purify</HI> them, even as Chri&s;t is pure." To conclude, let us ever retain a thankful "remem|brance of the works of the Lord, and the wonders" he has wrought both for our <HI>fathers</HI> of old, and for <HI>us</HI> their children, in later times&mdash;and con&s;ider the amazing ingratitude we &s;hall be guilty of, &s;hould we, either forget, or not live an&s;werable to our obliga|tions. Let us &s;et a high value upon tho&s;e privileges, civil and &s;acred, which we now enjoy, as we would avoid the guilt of the blacke&s;t ingratitude to Heaven&mdash; and of ca&s;ting a &s;acrilegious contempt upon the memory and blood of our <HI>ance&s;tors.</HI> We are bound by the mo&s;t &s;acred ties of duty to GOD&mdash;of e&s;teem and gratitude to our <HI>fathers</HI>&mdash;and of affection and concern for our <HI>children,</HI> to maintain a religious and inviolable regard for tho&s;e invaluable ble&s;&s;ings, which have been handed down to us, through &s;uch a chan|nel of &s;ufferings, labour and danger.</P>
<P>May the Lord God of our <HI>fathers</HI> &s;till delight to dwell with us, and to do us good as he did to them&punc; may the divine Spirit be poured out more and more upon us, for the revival of pure and primitive Chri&s;t|ianity! may his loving kindne&s;s never depart from

us or from our children. And may we &s;trive to be "followers of them who through faith and patience are now inheriting the promi&s;es." And O! may we and ours, at la&s;t, with them, in a world of perfect love, &s;ee and adore, with wonder and delight, the my&s;teries of providence, and grace&punc; which &s;hall then be opened up, to our everla&s;ting joy and &s;atisfaction; and with them, and all the heavenly ho&s;ts, may we join in anthems of prai&s;e and hallelujahs to the FATHER, to the SON and to the HOLY GHOST, one God over all, ble&s;&s;ed for ever-more.&mdash;AMEN.</P>

<HEAD>APPENDIX.</HEAD>
<P>AFTER the foregoing &s;ermon was prepared for the pre&s;s, it was &s;ugge&s;ted, that perhaps, &s;ome more particular account of what is hinted at in the Improvement, relative to a <HI>revival of religion</HI> in this place, might be gratifying to <HI>&s;ome,</HI> particu|larly to tho&s;e who, living at a di&s;tance, may have heard &s;omething of it, but from imperfect repre&s;en|tations, may not have been able to form ju&s;t concep|tions of it&mdash;and hoping it will not be offen&s;ive to any; e&s;pecially &s;ince it coincides &s;o naturally, with the preceeding text and &s;ubject&mdash;it is concluded to &s;ubjoin the following, by way of appendix; which is taken from a particular account of this matter, which the writer has recorded, in the <HI>records of this church:</HI> which is as follows&mdash;</P>
<P>"<HI>Nov.</HI> 9<HI>th.</HI> 1793. After the example of my ven|erable and pious predece&s;&s;or, the Rev. <HI>Mr. Leonard,</HI> (on an occa&s;ion, in &s;ome re&s;pects, &s;imilar) I think it may be for the glory of God, the honour of the Redeemer, the comfort of his children, and the bene|fit of po&s;terity, to mention here, and leave upon record, the wonderful di&s;plays of God's rich and &s;overeign grace towards this people, in a remarkable <HI>revival of religion,</HI> through the ble&s;&s;ed out-pouring of the Spirit of God, this year&mdash;which fir&s;t began to appear, the latter part of <HI>Dec.</HI> and beginning of <HI>Jan.</HI> la&s;t. No uncommon di&s;pen&s;ation of provi|dence&mdash;no public calamity, or any thing of that nature, had taken place, which might be a&s;&s;igned as an awakening cau&s;e of it. It &s;eemed, apparently, to
<PB N="53" REF="027629_0051_0FD619880B0E98D0">
be by the &s;till, &s;mall voice of the Spirit of God, the Author of all true religion&mdash;by his &s;ecret, but power|ful operation upon the minds of one and another; until, from &s;mall beginnings, it became more and more exten&s;ive; and at length, a general &s;olemnity and &s;erious concern &s;eemed vi&s;ibly to prevail through the town. The minds and attention of the greater part of the people appeared to be, in a greater or le&s;s degree, arre&s;ted on the &s;ubject of religion and the great concerns of another world. Be&s;ides the &s;tated wor&s;hip on Lord's days, we had frequent lectures in public and in private, on week days; and religious meetings for conference and &s;ocial wor&s;hip in pri|vate hou&s;es, &s;everal evenings in the week, in different parts of the town. Among which, it was remarka|ble, that the <HI>young children,</HI> from &s;even or eight, to fifteen years old, voluntarily agreed to meet once or twice a-week under the patronage, and by the con&s;ent of their parents and guardians; at which times they prayed, &s;ang, read and conver&s;ed upon the great things of another world; and behaved with great decency, order and unu&s;ual &s;olemnity; commonly to the number of 30 and 40&mdash;oftentimes more, even to 70 and 80&mdash;&s;everal times to upwards of 90&mdash;and yet, &s;urpri&s;ing it was to ob&s;erve, with what &s;ilence, they behaved, in coming to, and going from, as well as at their meetings. Mo&s;t certainly, for a con&s;iderable time&mdash;even for &s;everal months, there was a vi&s;ible and happy alteration among the youth and children&mdash; and there is rea&s;on to hope, &s;ome have been made partakers of a &s;aying change.&mdash;Be&s;ides the&s;e, great numbers, of different ages, in the town, have been &s;eriou&s;ly engaged and deeply impre&s;&s;ed with the infi|nitely important concerns of their &s;ouls and of eter|nity. And we have abundant rea&s;on humbly to hope, that a goodly number have really been made the happy &s;ubjects of the infinitely rich, free and &s;ove|reign

grace of God&mdash;who have
<Q>witne&s;&s;ed a good confe&s;&s;ion before men,</Q>
and who hitherto, all have appeared to be of blamele&s;s life and to walk agreeably to their profe&s;&s;ion&mdash;O that they may continue, and endure to the end! more than 50 have, within a few months, been added to our communion, and many more, it is expected, will join, who have expre&s;&s;ed their de&s;ires, and who entertain a hope of their being the &s;ubjects of real religion, at this time.</P>
<P>It is al&s;o to be remarked, with gratitude and &s;ati&s;|faction, that during this wonderful &s;ea&s;on of divine power and goodne&s;s here, the work has been remark|ably free from tho&s;e irregularities, di&s;orders, enthu|&s;ia&s;tic reveries, and tho&s;e corrupt mixtures, which, in times pa&s;t, have been the unhappy occa&s;ion of great &s;tumbling to many &s;erious minds, and of bitter oppo&s;ition from others, and which have brought great and indeliable reproach upon religion.&mdash;And although it is not to be expected, while the world &s;tands, and while the church of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> is in its mili|tant &s;tate, but that there will be every where, <HI>&s;ome,</HI> who di&s;regard religion wholly,
<Q>caring for none of the&s;e things&mdash;</Q>
<HI>others</HI> who are enemies to <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> and his kingdom, and will be oppo&s;ed to the truths and cau&s;e of God&mdash;and <HI>others</HI> again, who profe&s;s to be friendly to religion, but have different conceptions of <HI>&s;ome things</HI> relating to it, from others; towards whom, we would be very far from feeling an uncharitable di&s;po&s;ition&mdash;yet, I &s;ay, we have rea&s;on to &s;peak of it with thankfulne&s;s, there hath been <HI>le&s;s vi&s;ible oppo&s;ition</HI> to this work, than has been u&s;ual, at &s;uch times: which may probably (under a divine influence, and the re&s;training grace of God) be, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, the effect of that Spirit of liberty, of toleration and free inquiry, more prevalent at this day, than in for|mer times.</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="027629_0053_0FD6198C983EF478">It is very plea&s;ant to behold many, who formerly led vicious, carele&s;s and ungodly lives, and who ap|peared to live without God in the world; nor had any thought or concern about their &s;ouls and an another life, now become &s;erious and reformed, delighting them&s;elves in religion, and of a holy, heavenly de|portment and conver&s;ation. And 'tis beautiful to &s;ee many who are quite <HI>young,</HI> publickly owning Chri&s;t before the world, and engaged in practical religion, devoting them&s;elves to the &s;ervice of God in the days of their youth&mdash;thus crying "<HI>Ho&s;anna</HI> to the Son of David." That pa&s;&s;age has been truly veri|fied among&s;t us,
<Q>Out of the mouths of babes, and children, the Lord hath ordained prai&s;e.</Q></P>
<P>It is likewi&s;e a plea&s;ing con&s;ideration to ob&s;erve that fervent, Chri&s;tian <HI>love</HI> and <HI>unity,</HI> and that &s;weet communion, which &s;ub&s;i&s;ts among the profe&s;&s;ed friends of CHRIST; who frequently meet together, and "&s;peak often one to another," of the great things of CHRIST's kingdom, and his glorious pow|er and grace, to their mutual edification, comfort and quickening. And we have found un&s;peakable benefit from &s;uch private <HI>conferences</HI>; and have rea|&s;on to believe, they have been remarkably owned of God, as a means of keeping alive a &s;en&s;e of God, and a &s;avour of religion and eternal things, in our own &s;ouls; agreeable to that word
<Q>As iron &s;harpeneth iron, &s;o doth the countenance of a man his friend.</Q>
We have often been, on the&s;e occa&s;ions, con&s;trained to believe and &s;ay, "Surely God is in this place&mdash;" and with the di&s;ciples, "It is good for us to be here." And ble&s;&s;ed be the name of God, that we <HI>&s;till</HI> have the gracious and evident tokens of the divine pre&s;|ence among us, and the influences of his Holy Spirit; when it is now more than <HI>ten months,</HI> &s;ince the awa|kening and attention began.

(if I may be allowed to &s;peak &s;o per&s;onally) I am &s;ure I have the utmo&s;t rea&s;on to remark, with lively and humble gratitude, the goodne&s;s of God, to an un|worthy creature, in &s;trengthening, and &s;upporting him (naturally of a very feeble con&s;titution) under arduous labours, in preaching more abundantly&mdash;vi&s;iting&mdash; conver&s;ing with per&s;ons under &s;piritual trouble&mdash; conference-meetings, &amp;c. for &s;o long a time together.

And to him be all, all the prai&s;e and glory for ever; and may his name be magnified more and more&mdash;and his work be &s;till carried on here and throughout the land! And may the&s;e drops of mercy be a happy prelude of a more glorious and plentiful &s;hower of divine grace, and may the world be filled with the glory of the Lord!&mdash;This record is here made, as a grateful memorial, to the honour of the ble&s;&s;ed <HI>REDEEMER:</HI> and may the generations which &s;hall come after us, &s;ee it and prai&s;e his name.&mdash; Let them "remember the works of the Lord; &s;urely let them remember his wonders of old."</P>
