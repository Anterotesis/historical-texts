<P>Fir&s;t, A man may be Accu&s;ed of <HI>Iniquity</HI>; It may be &s;aid, <HI>Thou ha&s;t broken the Law, and thereby wronged the Name, of God, and the terrible penalty of that Law, now belongs unto thee.</HI> The An&s;wer to this <HI>Accu&s;ation</HI> is to be, <HI>My Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t ha's fully obey'd the will of God, and &s;uffered the penalty due to me for my Di&s;obedience; and I do by Faith de|pend on this Righteou&s;ne&s;s of my Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, for my Acceptance with God for ever.</HI></P>

<PB N="6" REF="000791_0006_0FAA53D5813F0BC8">
by <HI>Paul,</HI> That a man is <HI>Ju&s;tified alone by Faith:</HI> but it is a&s;&s;erted by <HI>James,</HI> That a man is <HI>not Ju&s;tified by a Faith which is alone.</HI> The Que&s;tion di&s;cour&s;ed by <HI>Paul</HI> is, <HI>How a Guilty Per&s;on may come to be Acquitted by the Lord, from all the Guilt that lies upon him?</HI> The An&s;wer to this Que&s;tion, is, Not by any <HI>Works</HI> of our own, but only by the <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, which is, on our part, only by <HI>Faith</HI> applied unto us. The Que&s;tion di&s;cour&s;ed by <HI>James,</HI> is, <HI>Whether a man pretending to Faith in the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, &s;hall be &s;aved, though he continue without the works of an Holy Life, agreeable thereunto</HI>? The An&s;wer to this Que&s;tion is, <HI>No,</HI> Such a man ha's no <HI>Saving Faith</HI> at all. And that <HI>James</HI> is to be taken in that &s;en&s;e, is evident from. This: He does in&s;i&s;t upon the In&s;tance of <HI>Abraham</HI>; and yet <HI>Abraham</HI> was a <HI>Ju&s;tified man,</HI> Thirty years, before tho&s;e <HI>Works,</HI> which are &s;aid here to <HI>Ju&s;tify</HI> him. Upon the whole then, we &s;ee <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>James,</HI> Recon|ciled, or, indeed, never contrdicting.

<P>There are Two very Important <HI>Ca&s;es,</HI> about which the Thoughts of every Chri&s;tian, cannot but be Exerci&s;ed; and we will here be&s;tow &s;ome of our Thoughts thereupon.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t <HI>Ca&s;e</HI> which a Chri&s;tian, mu&s;t Con&s;ider, if he would be a <HI>Chri&s;tian,</HI> is,

<P>Now we may thus conceive of them; <HI>Good Works,</HI> are <HI>Sincere E&s;&s;ayes</HI> to ob&s;erve the <HI>Law of God.</HI> Our God hath given us a <HI>Rule of Life,</HI> in that which we call, <HI>The Moral Law.</HI> None of our <HI>Works</HI> are <HI>Perfectly Good,</HI> if in any point they fall &s;hort of that <HI>Rule.</HI> But none of our <HI>Works</HI> do <HI>Perfectly</HI> come up to the <HI>Rule,</HI> as long as we are lodg'd in <HI>this Body which is to Dy.</HI> The <HI>Be&s;t me<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> alive, when they look upon the <HI>Be&s;t Works</HI> of the<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters"> Lives, may cry out, with one of the Ancients&punc; <HI>Terret me tota vita mea, nam apparet mihi, aut Pec|catum, aut tota Sterilitas</HI>; The <HI>Sinfulne&s;s,</HI> and <HI>Ba<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">|rann<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;s,</HI> of all my <HI>Life,</HI> &s;trikes me with a <HI>Deadly Terror</HI> of Soul!

<P>But now, to &s;peak &s;trictly, <HI>Good Works</HI> mu&s;t have the&s;e Four Ingredients to render them <HI>&s;uch.</HI></P>
<P>Fir&s;t; The <HI>Matter</HI> of our <HI>Works</HI> mu&s;t be, ac|cording to the <HI>Law</HI> of God, or, His <HI>Will</HI> Revealed in His <HI>Word.</HI> The Prophet could &s;ay, in Mic. 6.8. <HI>He hath &s;hewed thee, O man, the thing that is Good; and what doth the Lord require of thee, but to Do Ju&s;tice, and to Love Mercy, and to walk Hum|bly with thy God. Good Works</HI> mu&s;t be &s;uch, as the Lord hath <HI>&s;hewn</HI> to us, that He hath <HI>Required</HI> of us. They are no <HI>Good Works,</HI> whereof our God may &s;ay, <HI>Who hath required 'em</HI>? Works of <HI>Piety,</HI> are <HI>Good Wor<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters"></HI>; for we have the <HI>Word</HI> of our God for them; as in P&s;al. 92.1. <HI>It is a Good Thing to give Thanks unto the Lord.</HI> Works of <HI>Charity</HI> are <HI>Good Works</HI>; for we have the <HI>word</HI> of our God for them; as in Heb. 13.16. <HI>To Do Good, and to Communicate, forget not.</HI> No works are <HI>Good,</HI> but &s;uch as are contained in the <HI>Two Tables</HI> of the <HI>Ten Commandments</HI>; the Command|ments of <HI>Love</HI> to <HI>God,</HI> and of <HI>Love</HI> to <HI>Man.</HI></P>
<P>But unto the Con&s;titution of <HI>Good Works,</HI> it is <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">ot enough, that the <HI>matter</HI> of what we do, be <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">ccording to the <HI>Law</HI> of God. Men may do <HI>Works</HI> that &s;hall be <HI>Good</HI> for the <HI>matter</HI> of them, and yet, <HI>Every work of their Hands be unclean, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">aith the Lord. Plowing</HI> is Lawful, and <HI>Praying</HI>
<PB N="9" REF="000791_0009_0FAA53DA69913C40">
is Lawful; and yet the&s;e <HI>works</HI> may be &s;inful in the Doer of them. Wherefore,</P>
<P>Secondly, The <HI>Manner</HI> of our <HI>Works,</HI> mu&s;t be Right, as well as the <HI>Matter</HI> of them. A man may incur the Wrath of God, by his <HI>Good Works,</HI> if he do them not in any <HI>manner</HI> accor|ding to the <HI>Law,</HI> as they &s;hould be done. We find, in 1 Chron. 15.13. <HI>The Lord our God</HI> is offended at tho&s;e who <HI>Seek Him not after the due Order.</HI> No meer <HI>External Actions</HI> are to be E|&s;teemed <HI>Good Works</HI>; there mu&s;t <HI>Internal Cautions</HI> go along with them; el&s;e they are but the <HI>matter</HI> of <HI>Good Works,</HI> without the <HI>Form. Good Works</HI> mu&s;t be done with <HI>Regular Circum&s;tances,</HI> if they would be called, <HI>Good.</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly, The <HI>De&s;ign</HI> of our <HI>Works</HI> mu&s;t be Right, as well as the <HI>manner</HI> of them. The <HI>De|&s;ign</HI> which the <HI>Law</HI> of God has a&s;&s;igned for our <HI>Good Works,</HI> is, That the Great God, may be acknowledged, and magnified, and glorified: And the <HI>Go&s;pel</HI> of God, coming in, has a&s;&s;igned a further <HI>De&s;ign</HI> for them; namely, To expre&s;s our <HI>Gratitude</HI> unto our Lord-Redeemer, for His Redeeming of us. Thus 'tis Enjoined, in 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 10.30. <HI>Whatever ye do, do all to the Glory of God.</HI> An <HI>Evil Intention</HI> will utterly &s;poil any <HI>Go<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters"> Works,</HI> tho' they were otherwi&s;e never &s;o <HI>Go<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters"></HI> And a meerly <HI>Selfi&s;h Intention</HI> is an <HI>Evil</HI> one <HI>Good Works</HI> mu&s;t all be done, with an Eye, to the <HI>Honour</HI> of God, and the <HI>Service</HI> of Chri&s;t before any <HI>Temporal Advantage</HI> to <HI>Self</HI>: el&s;e the
<PB N="10" REF="000791_0010_0FAA53DAB677B9C0">
<HI>Be&s;t Sacrifices</HI> are but an <HI>Abomination.</HI></P>
<P>Fourthly, <HI>Good Works</HI> mu&s;t proceed from a <HI>Good <HI>Principle</HI></HI>; or otherwi&s;e they will have no <HI>Real Goodne&s;s</HI> in them. Waters that Flow from a bitter and a poi&s;on'd <HI>Fountain,</HI> can't be <HI>Good.</HI> A <HI>Good Heart,</HI> Like a <HI>Good Fountain,</HI> mu&s;t be the <HI>Principle,</HI> from whence <HI>Good Works</HI> are to flow. We are told, in Mat. 12.35. <HI>A Good man, out of the Good Trea&s;ure of the Heart, bringeth forth Good Things.</HI> A <HI>Good Principle</HI> within, is a <HI>Good Trea|&s;ure of the Heart. Works</HI> done meerly from a Principle of <HI>Slavi&s;h Fear,</HI> or <HI>Fle&s;hly Love,</HI> are not <HI>Good,</HI> tho' they be never &s;o <HI>Good.</HI> There mu&s;t be a <HI>Principle</HI> of <HI>Re&s;pect unto God in Chri&s;t,</HI> woo|ing us unto all our <HI>Good Works,</HI> or el&s;e they are <HI>Stark Naught.</HI> Yea, the <HI>Spirit</HI> of our Lord Je|&s;us Chri&s;t, mu&s;t be in us, as a <HI>Vital Principle,</HI> for our <HI>Good Works,</HI> or el&s;e they are <HI>Dead Works,</HI> every one of them. Hence, no <HI>Good Works</HI> were ever done by any one <HI>Unregenerate</HI> man, &s;ince the World began; for every <HI>Unregenerate</HI> man is de&s;titute of the <HI>Principle,</HI> which is to be acted in them: the mo&s;t <HI>Splendid Works</HI> of the Unregenerate, are but (as <HI>Au&s;tin</HI> call'd them) <HI>Splendid Sins</HI> before the Lord.</P>
<P>And now there is a Second <HI>Ca&s;e</HI> which a Chri&s;tian has to con&s;ider, that &s;o he may be &s;tirred up, and helped on, to do tho&s;e <HI>Good Works</HI> by which he may approve him&s;elf indeed a Chri&s;tian.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="000791_0011_0FAA53DB9370B710">Where Lies the <HI>Nece&s;&s;ity</HI> of Good Works, in a Ju&s;ti|fied Believer, to Ju&s;tifie the Faith, which he is a Profe&s;&s;or of?</P>
<P>Now we do know this; That our <HI>Good Works</HI> are not <HI>Antecedently</HI> nece&s;&s;ary unto our <HI>Ju|&s;tification</HI> before the God of Heaven. For <HI>Good VVorks</HI> cannot be done by any man, <HI>until</HI> he be <HI>Ju&s;tified.</HI> Until a man be <HI>United</HI> unto the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who is our <HI>Life,</HI> he is a <HI>Dead man:</HI> and what <HI>Good Works</HI> can a <HI>Dead man</HI> do? This is a thing <HI>Livelily</HI> Preached unto us, by our Lord Him&s;elf, in the fifteenth Chapter of <HI>John; The mouth of the Lord hath &s;poken it.</HI> Hence that common &s;aying of <HI>Au&s;tin, Bona Opera &s;equuntur Ju&s;tificatum, non praecedunt Ju&s;tificandum.</HI> No, nor is <HI>Faith</HI> it &s;elf, <HI>As</HI> doing of <HI>Good Works,</HI> that which Entitles us unto the <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, for our <HI>Ju&s;tification</HI>; 'Tis <HI>Faith,</HI> only <HI>As</HI> it Layes Hold on the <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, for the chief of Sinners,</HI> that <HI>Ju&s;tifies</HI> us; And until this be done, we cannot be carried forth unto any <HI>Good Works</HI> at all.</P>
