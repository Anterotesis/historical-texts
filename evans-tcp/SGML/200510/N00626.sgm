<HEAD>By His Excellency Coll. <HI>Benjamin Fletcher,</HI> Captain General and Governour in Chief of His Maje&s;ties Province of <HI>New-York, &amp;c.</HI> A PROCLAMATION</HEAD>
<P>WHEREAS His Maje&s;ties Companies gari&s;ons in this Province, are very much weakened by Death, Sickne&s;s and De&s;ertion, which renders the Fronteers in &s;ome danger, upon the approach of an Enemy, It being of ab&s;olute Nece&s;&s;ity, and a Duty incumbent upon me to take care and provide for the Defence and Pre&s;ervation of this His Maje&s;ties Province, which chiefly con&s;i&s;ts in the &s;trength of the Fronteers. And having under con&s;ideration the great hard&s;hip of Detaching the Inha|bitants, and how to joyn the ea&s;e and &s;afety of the Province together, to prevent an inevitable Nece&s;&s;ity of Detaching, I have therefore thought fit to publi&s;h and declare by this my Proclamation, That all Per&s;ons who are qualified to carry Arms, and will freely and voluntarily inli&s;t them&s;elves in any of his Maje&s;ties Companys for one Year, for their encouragement &s;hall receive the Sum of Three Pounds paid in hand, as al&s;o Four Pence a Day over and above their Provi&s;ions; and at the expiration of the Year &s;hall be di&s;charged from the &s;aid Service.</P>
