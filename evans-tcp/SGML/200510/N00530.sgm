<P N="1"><HI>S</HI> 1. IT was as long ago, as the year 1637. that a Faithful Minister of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> whose Name was Mr <HI>Edward Symons,</HI> did in a Sermon afterwards Printed, thus Express himselfe;
<Q>At <HI>New-England</HI> now the Sun of Comfort begins to appear, and the Glorious Day-Star to show it self; &mdash; <HI>Sea Venient Annis Saecula Seris,</HI> there will come Times, in after-ages when <HI>the Clouds will over-shadow and darken the Sky there.</HI> Many now promise to themselves no|thing but successive Happiness there, which <HI>for a Time</HI> through Gods Mercy they may Enjoy; and I Pray God, they may a <HI>Long Time</HI>; but in this World there is no Happiness perpetual.</Q>
An <HI>Observation,</HI> Or, <HI>I</HI> had almost said, an <HI>Inspiration,</HI> very dismally now verify'd upon us!

<P N="6"><HI>S</HI> 6&middot; 'Tis necessary that we <HI>&V;nite</HI> in every Thing: but there are especially <HI>Two</HI> Things wherein our <HI>&V;nion</HI> must carry us along together.

<P><HI>This is the Substance of Mr.</HI> Perkins. <HI>Take, Next, The Summ of Mr.</HI> Gaules <HI>Judgment, about the De|tection of</HI> Witches.</P>
<P><Q>I Some <HI>Tokens</HI> for the Trial of <HI>Witches,</HI> are altogether <HI>&V;nwarrantable.</HI> Such a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e the old Paganish Sign, The Witches <HI>Long Eyes</HI>; The Tradition, of the Witches not weeping; The casting of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he Witch into the Water, with Thumbs, and Toes, t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">'d across. And many more such Marks, which if they are to know a witch by, certainly 'tis no other witch, but the U<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">er of them. II. There are some <HI>Tokens</HI> for the Trial of <HI>Witches,</HI> more <HI>probable</HI>: and yet not so certain as to afford Conviction. Such are, strong and long Suspicion: Suspected Ancest|ors: some Appearance of Fact: The Corpse bleeding upon the Witches Touch: The <HI>Testimo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y of the Party Bewitched</HI>: The Supposed, Witches unusual <HI>Bodily Marks</HI>; The Witches usual Cursing and Banning: The Witch|es lewd and naughty kind of Life. III. Some Signs there are of a <HI>Witch,</HI> more certain and infallible. As, <HI>Firstly,</HI> Declining of Judicature, or Faltring, Faulty, Unconstant, and Contrary Answers, upon Judicial and Deliberate Examination <HI>Secondly,</HI> when upon due Encuiry, into a persons Faith and Manners, there are found <HI>all</HI> or <HI>most</HI> of the causes, which produce <HI>Witchcraft</HI>; namely, <HI>God</HI> Forsaking, <HI>Satan</HI> invading, particular <HI>Sins</HI> disposing, and Lastly a <HI>Compact</HI> compleating all. <HI>Thirdly,</HI> The Witches free Confession, together with Full Evidence of the Fact. <HI>Confession</HI> without <HI>Fact,</HI> may be a meer Delusion; and

IV. Among the most unhappy Circumstances, to Con|vict a Witch. One is, A Maligning and Oppugning, the Word, Work, and worship of God: and by any Extra|ordinary Sign <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eeking to seduce any from it.

with me, but unto one Paragraph of the Bible to be informed of three Things, relating to the <HI>Devil</HI>; `tis the Story of the <HI>Gadaren Energumen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> in the fifth Chapter of <HI>Mark.</HI></P>
<P>First, then; `Tis to be granted; The <HI>Devils</HI> are so many, that some <HI>Thousands,</HI> can sometimes a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> once apply themselves to vex <HI>one</HI> Child of Man&punc; It is said, in Marc. 5.15. <HI>He that was Possesse<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> with the Devil, had the Legion.</HI> Dreadful to be spoken!

So I say, <HI>There are multi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ud<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s, multitudes, in the valley of Destruction&punc; where the Devils are!</HI> When we speak of, <HI>The De|vil,</HI> `tis, <HI>A Name of Multitude</HI>; it means not <HI>One</HI> Individual Devil, so Potent and Scient, as perhaps a <HI>Man chee</HI> would imagine; but it means a <HI>Kind,</HI> which a <HI>Multitude</HI> belongs unto. Alas, The <HI>Devils,</HI> they swarm about us, like the <HI>Frogs of Egypt,</HI> in the most Retired of our Chambers. Are we at our <HI>Boards</HI>? There will be Devils to Tempt us unto Sensuality: Are we in our <HI>Beds</HI>? There will be Devils to Tempt us unto Carnality; Are we in our <HI>Shop<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI>? There will be Devils to Tempt us un|to Dishonesty. Yea, Tho' we get into the Church of God, there will be Devils to Haunt us in the very <HI>Temple</HI> it self, and there Tempt us to manifold Misbehaviours. I am verily perswaded, That there are very few Humane Affayrs, whereinto
<PB N="9" REF="000657_0041_0FA9A355F88953E0">
some Devils are not Insinuated; There is not so much as a <HI>Journey</HI> intended, but <HI>Satan</HI> will have an Hand in <HI>Hindering</HI> or <HI>Furthering</HI> of it.</P>
<P>Secondly, `Tis to be supposed, That there is a sort of Arbitrary, even Military <HI>Government,</HI> a|mong the <HI>Devils.</HI> This is intimated, when in <HI>Mar.</HI> 5.9. <HI>The Unclean Spirit <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">id, My Name is Legion:</HI> they are under such a Discipline as <HI>Legions</HI> use to be. Hence we read about, <HI>The Prince of the Pow|er of the Air:</HI> Our <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r</HI> has <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>Power!</HI> or an Army, of Devils in the <HI>High <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">aces</HI> of it; and these De|vils have a <HI>Prince</HI> over them, who is, <HI>King over the Children of Pride.</HI> `Tis probable, That the Devil, who was the Ring-leader of that mutinous and rebellious Crew, which first shook off the Authori|ty of God, is now the General of those Hellish Armies; Our Lord, that Conquer'd him, has told us the Name of him; tis <HI>Belzebub</HI>; 'tis he that is, <HI>the Devil,</HI> and the re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t are, <HI>his Angels,</HI> or his Souldiers.

<P>Thirdly, Tis to be supposed, That some <HI>Divels</HI> are more peculiarly <HI>Commission<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d,</HI> and perhaps <HI>Qua|lify'd,</HI> for some Countreys, while others are for others.

<P>We are also to Apprehend, that in the <HI>mean time,</HI> the Divel can give a shrowd guess, when he drawes near to the <HI>End of his Time.</HI> When he saw Christi|anity enthron'd among the <HI>Romans,</HI> it is here said, in our <HI>Rev,</HI> 12 12, <HI>He knows he hath but a short time<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> And how does he <HI>know</HI> it?

at last gave Mankind such a Distast in the Heart of the Just God, that he came to say, <HI>It Repents me, that I have made such a Creature</HI>!

<P>If Lastly, We are inquisitive after Instances of those Aggravated <HI>Woes,</HI> with which the Devil will towards the <HI>End</HI> of his <HI>Time</HI> assault us; Let it be Remembred, That all the Extremities which were foretold by the <HI>Trumpets</HI> and the <HI>Vials</HI> in the Apo|calyptic Schemes of these things, to come upon the world, were the <HI>woes</HI> to come from the <HI>wrath</HI> of the Divel, upon the <HI>shortning</HI> of his <HI>Time,</HI> The horren|dous desolations that have come upon mankind, by the Irruptions of the old <HI>Barbarians</HI> upon the Roman World, and then of the <HI>Saracens,</HI> and since, of the <HI>Turks,</HI> were such <HI>woes,</HI> as men had never seen before.

<P>But besides all these things, and besides, the In|crease of <HI>Plagues</HI> &amp; <HI>Wars,</HI> and <HI>Storms,</HI> and <HI>Internal Maladies</HI> now in our days, there are especially two most extraordinary <HI>Woes,</HI> one would fear, will in these days become very ordinary.

<HEAD>The first Conjecture&middot;</HEAD>
<P>The Devils <HI>Eldest Son</HI> seems to be towards the

<HI>End</HI> of his last <HI>Half-time</HI>; and if it be so, the De|vils <HI>Whole-time,</HI> cannot but be very near it's <HI>End.</HI> It is a very scandalous thing that any <HI>Protestant,</HI> should be at a loss where to find, <HI>The Anti-Christ.</HI> But, we have sufficient Assurance, that the Duration of <HI>Antichrist,</HI> is to be but for a <HI>Time,</HI> and for <HI>Times,</HI> and for <HI>Half a time</HI>; that is for <HI>Twelve-hundred and Sixty Years.</HI> And indeed, those <HI>Twelve Hundred and Sixty years,</HI> were the very Spott of <HI>Time</HI> left for the <HI>Devil,</HI> and meant when 'tis here said, <HI>He has but a short time.</HI> Now, I should have an <HI>Easy Time</HI> of it, if I were never put upon an <HI>Harder Task</HI>&punc; than to produce what might render it extreamly probable, That Antichrist entred his last <HI>Half-time,</HI> or the Last <HI>Hundred</HI> and <HI>Fourscore</HI> years of his Reign, <HI>at</HI> or soon <HI>after</HI> the Celebrated <HI>Reformation</HI> which began at the year 1517 in the former Century. In|deed, it is very agreeable to see how Antichrist then Lost <HI>Half</HI> of his Empire; and how that <HI>Half</HI> which then became <HI>Reformed,</HI> have been upon many ac|counts little more than <HI>Half-Reformed.</HI> But by this Computaion, we must needs bee within a very few years of such a <HI>Mortification</HI> to befall the See of <HI>Rome,</HI> as that Antichrist who ha's lately been plan|ting (what proves no more lasting than) a <HI>Taber|nacle in the Glorious Holy Mountain between the Seas,</HI> must quickly, <HI>Come to his End and none shall help him.</HI> So then, within a very little while, we shall see the Devil stript of the Grand, yea, the Last, <HI>Vehicle,</HI> wherein he will be capable to abuse our World.

<HEAD>The Third Conjecture.</HEAD>
<P>There is a <HI>Little Room</HI> for Hope, that the <HI>Great Wrath</HI> of the Devil, will not prove the Present Ruin of our poor <HI>New-England</HI> in particular. I believe, there never was a poor Plan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ation, more Pursued by the <HI>Wrath</HI> of the <HI>Devil,</HI> than <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> poor <HI>New-England</HI>; and that which makes our Condition very much the more deplorable is, That the <HI>Wrath</HI> of the <HI>Great God</HI> Himself, at the same Time also pres|ses hard upon us. It was a Rowsing <HI>Alarm</HI> to the Devil, when a great Company of English
<PB N="42" REF="000657_0074_0FA9A37032AD01D8">
<HI>Protestants</HI> and <HI>Puritans,</HI> came to Erect Evange|lical Churches, in a corner of the World, where he had Reign'd without any Controll for many Ages; and it is a vexing <HI>Eye-sore,</HI> to the Devil, that our Lord Christ should be known, and own'd, and preached in this <HI>Howling Wilderness.</HI> Wherefore he has left no <HI>Stone Unturned,</HI> that so he might undermine his Plantation, and force us out of our Country.</P>
<P>First, The Indian <HI>Powawes,</HI> used all their Sor|ceries to molest the First Planters here; but God said unto them, <HI>Touch them not</HI>! Then, <HI>Seducing Spirits,</HI> came to <HI>Root</HI> in this Vineyard, but God so Rated them off, that they have not prevail'd much further than the Edges of our Land. After this, we have had a continual <HI>Blast</HI> upon some of our principal Grain, Annu|ally diminishing a vast part of our <HI>Ordinary Food.</HI> Herewithal, Wasting <HI>Sicknesses,</HI> especially Burn|ing, and Mortal Agues, have Shot the Arrows of Death in at our Windows. Next, We have had many Adversaries of our own Language, who have been perpetually assaying to deprive us of those <HI>English Liberties,</HI> in the Encourage|ment whereof these Territories have been Set|tled. As if this had not been enough; The <HI>Tawnies</HI> among whom we came, have Watered our Soyl, with the Blood, of many Hundreds of our Inhabitants. Desolating <HI>Fires</HI> also have many times laid the chief Treasure of the whole Province in Ashes. As for <HI>Losses</HI> by Sea, <HI>they</HI>
<PB N="43" REF="000657_0075_0FA9A370F7ECBA08">
have been multiply'd upon us: and particularly in the present <HI>French War,</HI> the whole English Nation have observed, That no part of the Na|tion has proportionably had so many Vessels ta|ken, as our poor <HI>New-England.</HI> Besides all which, now at last the Devils are (if I may so speak) <HI>in Person</HI> come down upon us, with such a <HI>Wrath,</HI> as is justly <HI>much,</HI> and will quickly be <HI>more,</HI> the Asto|nishment of the World. Alas, I may Sigh over <HI>this</HI> Wilderness, as <HI>Moses</HI> did over <HI>his,</HI> in Psal. 90.7, 9. <HI>We are consumed by thine Anger, and by thy Wrath we are Troubled: All our Dayes are passed away in thy Wrath.</HI> And I may add this unto it, <HI>The Wrath of the Devil too has been Troubling and Spend|ing of us, all our Dayes.</HI></P>
<P>But what will become of this poor <HI>New-England</HI> after all? Shall we Sink, Expire, Perish, before the <HI>Short Time</HI> of the Devil shall be finished? I must confess, That when I consider the lamentable <HI>Unfruitfulness</HI> of men, among us, under as power|ful and perspicuous Dispensations of the Gospel, as are in the World; and when I consider the De|clining State of the <HI>Power of Godliness</HI> in our Chur|ches, with the most horrible Indisposition that per|haps ever was, to Recover out of this Declension; I cannot but <HI>Fear</HI> lest it comes to this, and lest an <HI>Asiatic</HI> Removal of Candlesticks come upon us. But upon some other Accounts, I would fain <HI>Hope</HI> otherwise; and I will give <HI>you</HI> therefore the op|portunity to Try what Inferences may be drawn from these probable Prognostications.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="000657_0076_0FA9A3720085C230">I say, First, That surely, <HI>America's</HI> Fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e, mu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> at the long run, include <HI>New-Englands</HI> in it.

<P>I say, <HI>Secondly,</HI> That tho' there be very <HI>Threat|ning</HI> Symptoms on <HI>America,</HI> yet there are some <HI>Hopeful</HI> ones.

<HI>Promises,</HI> That our <HI>Lord Jesus Christ shall have the uttermost parts of the Earth for his Possession</HI>? and of all the <HI>Prophecies,</HI> That <HI>All the ends of the Earth shall Remember and Turn unto the Lord</HI>? Or does it look <HI>Agreeably,</HI> That such a Rich Quarter of the VVorld, equal in some Regards to all the Rest, should never be out of the <HI>Devils</HI> Hands, from the first Inhabitation unto the Last Dissolution of it?

Cruel Depredations are then made upon the Vici|nage.

her Aunt was all grievously scorch'd with the Fire, and the Deponent going to her House, found her in such a Condition. <HI>Duny</HI> told her, she might thank her for it; but she should live to see some of her Children Dead, and her self upon Crutches. But after the Burning of the Toad, this Child Re|covered.</P>
<P>This Deponent further Testify'd, That Her Daughter <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> being about the Age of Ten Years, was taken in like manner, as her first Child was, and in her Fitts complained much of <HI>Amy Duny,</HI> and said, that she did appear to Her, and afflict her in such manner as the former. One Day she found <HI>Amy Duny</HI> in her House, and thrusting her out of Doors, <HI>Duny</HI> said, <HI>You need not be so Angry, your Child wont live long.</HI> And within three Days the Child Dyed. The Deponent ad|ded, that she was Her self, not long after taken with such a Lameness, in both her Leggs, that she was forced to go upon Crutches; and she was now in Court upon them. [It was Re|markable, that immediately upon the Juries bring|ing in <HI>Duny</HI> Guilty, <HI>Durent</HI> was restored unto the use of her Limbs, and went Home without Her Crutches.]</P>
<P N="3">III. As for <HI>Elizabeth</HI> and <HI>Deborah Pacy,</HI> one Aged Eleven years, the other Nine; the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lder, being in Court, was made utterly senseless, during all the time of the Triall: or at least speechless. By the directi|on of the Judge, <HI>Duny</HI> was privately brought to <HI>Eliza|beth
<PB N="86" REF="000657_0118_0FA9A2B7B6A9ED50">
Pacy,</HI> and she touched her Hand: whereupon the child, without, so much as seeing her, suddenly leap'd up and flew upon the prisoner; the younger was too ill, to be brought unto the Assizes. But <HI>Samuel Pacy,</HI> their Father, testify'd, that his Daughter <HI>Deborah,</HI> was taken with a sudden lameness; and up|on the grumbling of <HI>Amy Duny,</HI> for being denyed something, where this child was then sitting, the child was taken with an extreeme pain in her sto|mach,, like the pricking of pins; and shricking at a dreadful manner, like a Whelp, rather then a Rati|onal creature. The Physicians could not conjecture the cause of the Distemper; but <HI>Amy Duny</HI> being a woman of Ill Fame, and the child in fitts crying out of <HI>Amy Duny,</HI> as affrighting her with the Ap|parition of her person, the deponent suspected her, and procured her to be set in the stocks. While she was there, she said in the hearing of two Wit|nesses, <HI>Mr</HI> Pacy <HI>keeps a great stir about his child, but let him stay till he has done as much by his Children, as I have done by mine</HI>: and being asked, What she had done to her Children, she answered, <HI>She had been fain to open her Childs mouth with a Tap to give it Victuals.</HI> The Deponent added, that with|in two Days, the Fits of his Daughters were such, that they could not preserve either Life or Breath, without the help of a Tap. And that the Children cry'd out of <HI>Amy Duny,</HI> and of <HI>Rose Cullender,</HI> as afflicting them, with their Ap|paritions.</P>
<P N="4">IV. The Fits of the Children, were various.
<PB N="87" REF="000657_0119_0FA9A2B8719052F0">
They would sometimes be Lame on one side&punc; sometimes on t'other. Sometimes very sore; sometimes restored unto their Limbs, and then Deaf, or Blind, or Dumb, for a long while to|gether. Upon the Recovery of their Speech, they would Cough extreamly; and with much Flegm, they would bring up Crooked Pins; &amp; one time, a Two-penny Nail, with a very broad Head. Commonly at the end of every Fit, they would cast up a Pin. When the Children Read, they could not pronounce the Name of, <HI>Lord,</HI> or <HI>Jesus</HI> or <HI>Christ,</HI> but would fall into Fitts; and say, Amy Duny <HI>says, I must not use that Name.</HI> When they came to the Name of <HI>Satan,</HI> or <HI>Devil,</HI> they would clap their Fingers on the Book, crying out, <HI>This bites, but it makes me speak right well</HI>! The Children in their Fitts, would often cry out, <HI>There stands</HI> Amy Duny, <HI>or,</HI> Rose Cullen|der; and they would afterwards relate, <HI>That these Witches appearing before them, threatned them, that if they told what they saw or heard, they would Torment them ten times more than ever they did before.</HI></P>
<P N="5">V. <HI>Margaret Arnold,</HI> the Sister of Mr. <HI>Pacy,</HI> testify'd unto the like Sufferings being upon the Children, at her House, whither her Brother had Removed them. And that sometimes, the Children (<HI>only</HI>) would see things like Mice, run about the House; and one of them sudden|ly snap't one with the Tongs, and threw it in|to
<PB N="88" REF="000657_0120_0FA9A2BA00450FB0">
the Fire, where it screeched out like a Rat. At another time, a thing like a Bee, flew at the Face of the younger Child; the Child fell into a Fitt; and at last Vomited up a, <HI>Two-pen|ny Nail,</HI> with a Broad Head; affirming, <HI>That the Bee brought this Nail, and forced it into her mouth.</HI> The Child would in like manner be as|saulted with Flies, which brought Crooked Pins, unto her, and made her first swallow them, and then Vomit them. She one Day caught, an In|visible <HI>Mouse,</HI> and throwing it into the Fire, it Flash'd like to Gun-Powder. None besides the Child saw the <HI>Mouse,</HI> but every one saw the <HI>Flash.</HI> She also declared, out of her Fitts, that in them, <HI>Amy Duny,</HI> much tempted her to Destroy Her self.</P>
<P N="6">VI. As for <HI>Ann Durent,</HI> her Father Testifyed That upon a Discontent of <HI>Rose Cull<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nder,</HI> His Daugh|ter was taken with much Illness in her Stomach and great and sore Pains, like the pricking of pins: and then Swooning Fitts, from which Recovering she declared, <HI>She had s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">en the Apparition of</HI> Rose Cul|lender, <HI>Threatning to Torment her.</HI> She likewise Vo|mited up diverse Pins. The Maid was Present at Court, but when <HI>Cullender</HI> look'd upon her, she fell into such Fitts, as made her utterly un|able to declare any thing.</P>
<P><HI>Ann Baldwin,</HI> deposed the same.</P>
<P N="7">VII. <HI>Jane Bocking,</HI> was too weak, to be at
<PB N="79" REF="000657_0121_0FA9A2BAB34970B8">
the Assizes. But her Mother Testify'd, that Her Daughter having formerly been Afflicted with Swooning Fitts, and Recovered of them; was now taken with a great Pain in her Stomach; and New Swooning Fitts. That she took little Food, but every Day Vomited Crooked Pins. In her first Fitts, she would Extend her Arms, and use Postures, as if she catched at something, and when her Clutched Hands were forced open, they would find several Pins diversely Crooked, unac|countably lodged there. She would also maintain a Discourse with some that were Invisibly present, when casting abroad her Arms, she would often say, <HI>I will not have it</HI>! but at last say, <HI>Then</HI> I <HI>will have it</HI>! and closing her Hand, which when they presently after opened, a Lath-Nail was found in it. But Her great complaints were of being Visited by the shapes of <HI>Amy Duny,</HI> and <HI>Rose Cullender.</HI></P>
<P N="8">VIII. As for <HI>Susan Chandler,</HI> Her Mother Testi|fyed, That being at the search of <HI>Rose Cullender,</HI> they found on her Belly a thing like a Teat, of an Inch long; which the <HI>said Rose</HI> ascribed to a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ain. But near her Privy parts, they found Three mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e, that were smaller than the former. At the end of the long Teat, there was a little Hole, which ap|peared, is if newly Sucked; and upon straining it, a white milky matter issued out. The Deponent further said, That her Daughter being one day concerned at <HI>Rose Cullenders</HI> taking her by the Hand, she fell very sick, and at Night cry'd out,
<PB N="90" REF="000657_0122_0FA9A2BB6F61A380">
<HI>That</HI> Rose Cullendet <HI>woald come to Bed unto her</HI>&punc; Her Fitts grew violent, and in the Intervals of them, she declared, <HI>That she saw</HI> Rose Cullender <HI>in them, and once having of a great Dog with her.</HI> She also vomited up crooked Pins; and when she was brought into Court, she fell into her Fitts. She Recovered her self in some Time, and was asked by the Court, whether she was in a Conditi|on to take an Oath, and give Evidence. She said, she could; but having been Sworn, she fell into her Fitts again, and, <HI>Burn her! Burn her!</HI> were all the words that she could obtain power to speak. Her Father likewise gave the same Testimony with her Mother; as to all but the Search.</P>
<P N="9">IX. Here was the Sum of the Evidence: which Mr. Serjeant <HI>Keeling,</HI> thought not sufficient to Convict the Prisoners. For admitting the Chil|dren were Bewitched, yet, said he, it can never be Apply'd unto the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">isoners, upon the Imagina|tion only of the Parties Afflicted; inasmuch as no person whatsoever could then be in Safety.</P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Brown,</HI> a very Learned Person then pre|sent, gave his Opinion, that these persons were Bewitched. He added, That in <HI>Denmark,</HI> there had been lately a great Discovery of Witches; who used the very same way of Afflicting people, by Conveying Pins and Nails into them. His Opi+nion was, that the Devil in Witchcrafts, did Work upon the Bodies of Men and Women, upon a <HI>Natu|ral Foundation</HI>; and that he did Extraordinarily af|flict
<PB N="91" REF="000657_0123_0FA9A2BC43087188">
them, with such Distempers as their Bodies were most subject unto.</P>
<P N="10">X. The Experiment about the <HI>Usefulness,</HI> yea, or <HI>Law|fulness</HI> whereof Good Men have sometimes disputed, was divers Times made, That though the Afflicted were utterly deprived of all sense in their Fitts, yet upon the <HI>Touch</HI> of the Accused, they would so screech out, and Fly up, as not upon any other persons. And yet it was also found that once upon the touch of an innocent person, the like effect follow'd, which put the whole Court unto a stand: altho' a small Reason was at length attempted to be given for it.</P>
<P N="11">XI. However, to strengthen the Credit of what had been already produced against the Pri|soners. One <HI>John Soam</HI> testify'd, That bringing home his Hay in three Carts, one of the Carts wrenched the Window of <HI>Rose Cullenders</HI> Hous<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> whereupon she flew out, with violent Threat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ings against the Deponent. The other two Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">s, passed by twice, Loaded, that Day afterwards; but the Cart which touched <HI>Cullenders</HI> House, was twice or thrice that Day overturned. Ha|ving again Loaded it, as they brought it thro' the Gate which Leads out of the Field&punc; the Cart stuck so fast in the Gates Head, that they could not possibly get it thro', but were forced to cut down the Post of the Gate, to make the Cart pass thro', altho' they could
<PB N="92" REF="000657_0124_0FA9A2BCF04A51E8">
not perceive that the Cart did of either sid<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> touch the Gate-Post. They afterwards, did with much Difficulty get it home to the yard; but could not for their Lives get the Cart near the place, where they should unload. They were fain to unload at a great Distance; and when they were Tired, the Noses of them that came to Assist them, would burst forth a Blee|ding; so they were fain to give over till next m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ning; and then they unloaded without any Difficulty.</P>
<P N="12">XII. <HI>Robert Sherringham</HI> also testify'd, That the Axle-Tree of his Cart, happening in passing, to break some part of <HI>Rose Cullenders</HI> House, in her Anger at it, she vehemently threatned him, <HI>Hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Horses should suffer for it.</HI> And within a short time, all his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">our Horses dy'd; after which he sus|tained many other losses in the sudden Dying of his Cattle. He was also taken with a Lameness in his limbs; and so vexed with lice of an extraor|dinary Number and Bigness, that no Art could hin|der the Swarming of them, till he burnt up, two suits of Apparrel.</P>
<P N="13">XIII. As for <HI>Amy Duny,</HI> t'was testfi'd by one <HI>Richard Spencer</HI>' that he heard her say, <HI>The Devil would not lett her Rest; until she were Revenged on the wife of</HI> Cornelius Sandswel And that <HI>Sandswel</HI> testi|fy'd, that her Poultrey dy'd suddenly, upon <HI>Am<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Dunyes</HI> threatning of them; and that her Husband Chimney fell, quickly after <HI>Duny</HI> had spoken<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">
<PB N="93" REF="000657_0125_0FA9A2BDBA343908">
such a disaster. And a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">irkin of Fish could not be kept from falling into the water, upon suspicious words of <HI>Duny's.</HI></P>
<P N="14">XIV. The Judge, told the Jury, they were to inquire now, first, whether these Children were Bewitched; and secondly, Whether the Prisoners at the Bar were guilty of it. He made no doubt, there were such Creatures as Witches; for the Scriptures af|firmed it; and the Wisdom of all Nations had pro|vided Laws against such persons. He pray'd the God of Heaven, to direct their Hearts in the weighty thing they had in hand; for, <HI>To Condemn the Innocent, and let the Guilty go free, were both an A|bomination to the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>The Jury in half an Hour, brought them in <HI>Guilty,</HI> upon their several Indictments, which were Nineteen in Number.</P>
<P>The next morning, the Children with their Parents, came to the Lodgings of the Lord Chief Justice, and were in as good Health, as ever in their Lives; being Restored within half an Hour after the Witches were Convicted.</P>
<P>The Witches were Executed; and <HI>Confessed</HI> no|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ing; which indeed will not be wondred by them, who Consider and Entertain the Judgment <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> a Judicious Writer, <HI>That the Unpardonable Sin&punc; most usually Committed by Professors of the Christian Religion&punc; falling into Witchcraft.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="94" REF="000657_0126_0FA9A2BE70FE5FA8">We will now proceed unto several of the like Trials among our selves.</P>
</DIV3>

<HEAD>I. THE TRYAL of G. B. At a Court of Oyer and Terminer, Held in <HI>Salem.</HI> 1692.</HEAD>
<P>GLad should I have been, if I had never known the Name of this man; or never had this occasion to mention so much as the first Letters of his Name. But the Government requiring some Account, of his Trial, to be Inserted in this Book, it becomes me with all Obedience, to submit unto the Order.</P>
<P N="1">I&punc; This <HI>G. B.</HI> was Indicted for <HI>Witchcrafts</HI>; and in the Prosecution of the Charge against him, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> was Accused by five or six of the Bewitched, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the Author of their Miseries; he was Accused <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> eight of the Confessing Witches, as being an Hea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> Actor of some of their Hellish Randezvouses, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="95" REF="000657_0127_0FA9A2BF37EB6248">
one who had the promise of being a <HI>King</HI> in Sa|tans Kingdom, now going to be Erected; he was Accused by nine persons, for extraordinary Lift|ing, and such Feats of Strength, could not be done without a Diabolical Assistance. And for other such Things he was Accused, until about Thirty Testimonies were brought in against him; nor were these, judg'd the half of what might have been considered, for his Conviction: however they were enough to fix the Character of a <HI>Witch</HI> upon him, according to the Rules of Reasoning, by the Judicious <HI>Gaule,</HI> in that Case directed.</P>
<P N="2">II. The Court being sensible, that the <HI>Testimo|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ies of the Parties Bewitched,</HI> use to have a Room a|mong the <HI>Suspicions,</HI> or <HI>Presumptions,</HI> brought in a|gainst one Indicted for Witchcraft, there were now heard the Testimonies of several Persons, who were most notoriously Bewitched, and every day Tortured by Invisible Hands, and these now all charged the Spectres of <HI>G. B.</HI> to have a share in their Torments. At the Examination of this <HI>G. B.</HI> the Bewitched People were grievously harassed, with Preternatural Mischiefs, which could not possibly be Dissembled; and they still ascribed it unto the Endeavours of <HI>G. B.</HI> to kill them. And <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ow upon his Trial, one of the Bewitched Per|sons testify'd, That in her Agonies, a little Black <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> man came to her, saying his Name was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> bidding her set her hand unto a Book which&punc; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> show'd unto her; and br<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">gging that he was a

<HI>Conjurer</HI> above the ordinary Rank of Witches; That he often persecuted her, with the offer of that Book, saying, <HI>She should be well, and need fear no body, if she would but Sign it</HI>: but he inflicted cruel Pains and Hurts upon her, because of her Denying so to do. The Testimonies of the other Sufferers concurred with these; and it was I markable, that whereas <HI>Biting,</HI> was one of the ways which the Witches used, for the vexing of the Sufferers, when they cry'd out of <HI>G.</HI> B. biting them, the print of the Teeth, would be seen on the Flesh of the Complainers; and just such a sett of <HI>Teeth,</HI> as <HI>G.</HI> B.<HI>'s</HI> would then appear upon them, which could be distinguished from those of some other mens. Others of them testify'd, That in their Torments, <HI>G. B.</HI> tempted them, to go unto a Sacrament, unto which they perceived him with a sound of Trumpet Summoning of other Witch|es&punc; who quickly after the Sound would come from all Quarters unto the Rendezvouz. One of them falling into a kind of Trance, afterwards af|firmed, That <HI>G.</HI> B. had carried her into a very high Mountain, where he show'd her mighty and glorious Kingdoms, and said, <HI>He would give them all to her, if she would write in his Book</HI>; but she told him, <HI>They were none of his to give</HI>; and refused the motions; enduring of much misery for that Re|fusal.</P>
<P>It cost the Court a wonderful deal of Trouble, to hear the Testimonies of the Sufferers; for whe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> they were going to give in their Depositions, the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="97" REF="000657_0129_0FA9A2C0C7B1D940">
would for a long while be taken with fitts, that made them uncapable of saying any thing. The Chief Judge asked the prisoner, who he thought hindred these witnesses from giving their testimo|nies? and he answered, <HI>He supposed, it was the Divel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> That Honourable person, then reply'd, <HI>How comes the Divel so loathe to have any Testimony born against you</HI>? Which cast him into very great confusion.</P>
<P N="3">III. It has been a frequent thing for the Be|witched people, to be entertained with Apparitions of <HI>Ghosts</HI> of murdered people, at the same time, that the <HI>Spectres</HI> of the witches trouble them. These Ghosts do always affright the Beholders, more than <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ll the other spectral Representations; and when they exhibit themselves, they cry out, of being Murdered by the witchcrafts or other violences of the persons who are then in spectre present. It is further considerable, that once or twice, these <HI>Ap|paritions</HI> have been seen by others at the very same time that they have shown them selves to the Be|witched; &amp; seldom have there been these <HI>Apparition</HI> but when somthing unusual &amp; suspected had attend|ed the Death of the party thus Appearing. Some that have bin accused by these <HI>Apparitions,</HI> accosting of the Bewitched People, who had never heard a word of any such persons, ever being in the world, have upon a fair examination freely, and fully, confessed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he murders of those very persons, altho' these also <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> not know how the <HI>Apparitions</HI> had complained <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> them&punc; Accordingly several of the Bewitched,
<PB N="98" REF="000657_0130_0FA9A2C180DDE898">
had given in their Testimony, that they had been troubled with the <HI>Apparitions</HI> of two women, who said, that they were <HI>G.

<P>We<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> G.

But he, tho' much appalled, utterly deny'd that he discerned any thing of it; nor was it any part of his <HI>Conviction.</HI></P>
<P N="4"><PB N="99" REF="000657_0131_0FA9A2C367C92E40">IV Judicious Writers, have assigned it a great place, in the Conviction of <HI>witches, when persons are Impea|ched by other Notorious witches, to be as Ill as themselves; especially, if the persons have been much noted for neglect|ing the Worship of God.</HI> Now, as there might have been Testimonies Enough of G.

Antipathy to <HI>Prayer</HI> and the other Ordinances of God, tho' by his profession singularly obliged thereunto; so, there now came in against the prisoner, the Testimonies of several persons, who confessed their own having been Horrible <HI>Witches,</HI> and ever since their confessi|ons had been themselves terribly Tortured by the Devils and other Witches, even like the other Suf|ferers; and therein undergone the pains of many <HI>Deaths</HI> for their Confessions.</P>
<P>These now Testify'd, that <HI>G.

<P>[Yea, there were Two Testimonies, that G.

Indeed one of these Witnesses, was over perswaded by some persons, to be out of the way, upon G. B.'s Trial; but he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ame afterwards, with sorrow for his withdraw, and gave in his Testimony: Nor were either of these Witnesses made use of as evidences in the Trial.]</P>
<P N="6"><HI>VI.</HI> There came in several Testimonies, rela|ting to the Domestick Affayrs of G. B. which had a very hard Aspect upon him; and not only prov'd him a very ill man; but also confirmed the Belief of the Character, which had been al|ready fastned on him. e. g.</P>
<P>T'was testifyed, That keeping his two Suc|cessive Wives in a strange kind of Slavery, he would when he came home from abroad, pretend to tell the Talk which any had with them&punc; That he ha's brought them to the point of Death, by his Harsh Dealings with his Wives, and then made the People about him to promise that in Case Death should happen, they would say no|thing

of it. That he used all means to make his Wives, Write, Sign, Seal, and Swear a Covenant, never to Reveal any of his Secrets. That his W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">es had privately complained unto the Neigh|bours about frightful Apparitions of Evil Spirits, with which their House was sometimes infested; and that many such things have been Whispered among the Neighbourhood. There were also some other Testimonies, relating to the Death of People, where|by the Consciences of an Impartial Jury, were con|vinced, that <HI>G.

But I am forced to o|mit several such passages, in this, as well as in all the succeeding <HI>Trials,</HI> because the Scribes who took Notice of them, have not Supplyed me.</P>
<P N="7">VII. One Mr. <HI>Ruck,</HI> Brother in Law to this <HI>G. B.</HI> Testify'd, that <HI>G. B.</HI> and he himself, and his Sister, who was <HI>G.

G. B. immediately, then fell to chiding his Wife, on the account of what she had been speaking to her

Brother, of him, on the Road: which when they wondred at, he said, <HI>He knew their thoughts. Ruck</HI> being startled at that, made some Reply, intimating that the Devil himself did not know so far; but G.

Only he said, <HI>Ruck, and his Wife left a man with him, when they left him.</HI> Which <HI>Ruck</HI> now affirm'd to be false; and when the Court asked <HI>G. B. What the Man's Name was?</HI> his countenance was much altered; nor could he say, who 'twas. But the Court began to think, that he then step'd aside, only that by the assistance of the <HI>Black Man,</HI> he might put on his <HI>Invisibility,</HI> and in that <HI>Fascinating Mist,</HI> gratify his own Jealous humour, to hear what they said of him. Which trick of rendring themselves <HI>Invisible,</HI> our Witches do in their confessions pretend that they sometimes are Masters of; and it it is the more credible, because there is Demonstration that they often render many other things utterly <HI>Invisible.</HI></P>
<P N="8">VIII. <HI>Faltring, Fau<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ty, unconstant, and contrary Answers upon Judicial and deliberate examination,</HI> are counted some unlucky symptoms of guilt, in all crimes; Especially in Witchcrafts.

heard some things that he could not prove, Reflect|ing upon the Reputation of some of the witnesses. Only he gave in a paper, to the Jury; wherein, al|tho' he had many times before, granted, not only that there are <HI>Witches,</HI> but also that the present sufferings of the Countrey are the Effect of horri|ble <HI>Witchcrafts,</HI> yet he now goes to, evince it, <HI>That there neither are, nor ever were, Witches that having made a compact with the Divel, Can se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d a Dive<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to Torment other people at a distance.</HI> This paper was Transcribed out of <HI>Ady</HI>; which the Court presently knew, as soon as they heard it.

such Cases Usual. And pleading, <HI>Not Guilty,</HI> there were brought in several persons, who had long un|dergone many kinds of Miseries, which were pre|ternaturally Inflicted, and generally ascribed unto an horrible <HI>Witchcraft.</HI> There was little Occasion to prove the <HI>Witchcraft</HI>; it being Evident and No|to<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ious to all Beholders. Now to fix the <HI>Witch|craft</HI> on the Prisoner at the Bar, the first thing used was, the Testimony of the <HI>Bewitched</HI>; whereof, several Testify'd, That the <HI>Shape</HI> of the Prisoner did oftentimes very grievously pinch them, choak them, Bite them, &amp; Aff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ict them; urging them to write their Names in a <HI>Book,</HI> which the said Spe|ctre called, <HI>Ours.</HI> One of them did further Testi|fy, that it was the <HI>Shape</HI> of this Prisoner, with a|nother, which one Day took her from her Wheel&punc; and carrying her to the River side, threatn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> there to Drown her, if she did not Sign to the Book mentioned: which yet she refused. Others of them did also Testify, that the said <HI>Shape,</HI> did in her Threats, brag to them, that she had been the Death of sundry persons, then by her Named; that she had <HI>Ridden</HI> a man, then likewise Named. Another Testify'd, the Apparition of <HI>Ghosts</HI> unto the Spectre of <HI>Bishop,</HI> crying out, <HI>You Murdered us!</HI> About the Truth whereof, there was in the matter of Fact, but too much Suspicion.</P>
<P N="2"><HI>II.</HI> It was Testify'd, That at the Examination of the Prisoner, before the Magistrates, the Be|witched were extreamly Tortured. If she did

but cast her Eyes on them, they were presently struck down; and this in such a manner as there could be no Collusion in the Business. But upon the Touch of her Hand upon them, when they lay in their Swoons, they would immediately Re|vive; and not upon the Touch of any ones else. Moreover, upon some Special Actions of her Bo|dy, as the shaking of her Head, or the Turning of her Eyes, they presently and painfully f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ll into the like postures. And many of the like Accidents now fell out, while she was at the Ba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. One at the same time testifying, That she said, <HI>She could not be Troubled to see the Afflicted thus Tormented.</HI></P>
<P N="3"><HI>III.</HI> There was Testimony likewise brought in, that a man striking once at the place, where a Be|witched person said, the <HI>Shape</HI> of this <HI>Bishop</HI> stood, the Bewitched cryed out, that he had Tore her Coat, in the place then particularly specify'd; and the Womans Coat, was found to be Torn in that very place.</P>
<P N="4">IV. One <HI>Deliverance Hobbs,</HI> who had Confessed her being a Witch, was now Tormented by the Spe|ctres, for her Confession. And she now Testify'd, That this <HI>Bishop,</HI> tempted her to Sign the <HI>Book</HI> again, and to Deny what she had Confess'd. She affirmed, that it was the Shape of this Prisoner, which whipped her with Iron Rods, to compel her thereunto. And she affirmed, that this <HI>Bishop</HI> was at a General Meeting of the Witches, in a

<P N="5">V. To render it further Unquestionable, that the prisoner at the Bar, was the Person truly charged in THIS <HI>Witchcraft,</HI> there were produced many E|vidences of OTHER <HI>Witchcrafts,</HI> by her perpetra|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed. For Instance, <HI>John Cook</HI> testify'd, that about <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ve or six years ago, One morning, about Sun-Rise, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e was in his Chamber, assaulted by the <HI>Shape</HI> of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">his prisoner: which Look'd on him, g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">in'd at him, and very much hurt him, with a Blow on the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ide of the Head&punc; and that on the same day, a|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">out Noon, the same <HI>Shape</HI> walked in the Room where he was, and an Apple strangely flew out of his Hand, into the Lap of his mother, six or eight foot from him.</P>
<P N="6">VI. <HI>Samuel Gray,</HI> testify'd, That about fourteen years ago, he wak'd on a Night, &amp; saw the Room where he lay, full of Light; &amp; that he then saw plainly a Woman between the Cradle, and the Bed-side, which look'd upon him. He Rose, and it vanish|ed; tho' he found the Doors all fast. Looking <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ut at the Entry-Door, he saw the same Woman, in the same Garb again; and said, <HI>In Gods Name, what do you come for?</HI> He went to Bed, and had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he same Woman again assaulting him. The Child <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n the Cradle gave a great schreech, and the Wo|man Disappeared. It was long before the Child
<PB N="108" REF="000657_0140_0FA9A2C9C0F10EF0">
could be quieted; and tho' it were a very likely thriving Child, yet from this time it pined away, and after divers months dy'd in a sad Condition&punc; He knew not <HI>Bishop,</HI> nor her Name; but when he saw her after this, he knew by her Countenance, and Apparrel, and all Circumstances, that it was the Apparition of this <HI>Bishop,</HI> which had thus troubled him.</P>
<P N="7">VII. <HI>Iohn Bly</HI> and his wife, testify'd, that he bought a sow of <HI>Edward Bishop,</HI> the Husband of the prisoner; and was to pay the price agreed, unto another person. This Prisoner being Angry that she was thus hindred from fingring the money, Quarrell'd with <HI>Bly.</HI> Soon after which the Sow, was taken with strange Fits; Jumping, Leaping, and knocking her head against the Fence, she seem'd Blind and Deaf, and would neither <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eat nor be suck'd. Whereupon a neighbour said, she believed the Creature was <HI>Over-Looked</HI>; &amp; sundry other cir|cumstances concurred, which made the Deponents Belive that <HI>Bishop</HI> had Bewitched it.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. <HI>Richard Coman</HI> testify'd, that eight years ago, as he lay Awake in his Bed, with a Light Burning in the Room, he was annoy'd with the Apparition of this <HI>Bishop,</HI> and of two more that were strangers to him; who came and oppressed him so that he could neither stir himself, nor wake any one else: and that he was the night after, molested again in the like manner; the said <HI>Bishop</HI> taking him by the Throat, and pulling him almost out of the Bed. His kinsman offered for this cause to lodge with him; and that Night, as they were Awake
<PB N="109" REF="000657_0141_0FA9A2CB36489F28">
Discoursing together: this <HI>Coman</HI> was once more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">isited, by the Guests which had formerly been so troublesome; his kinsman being at the same time <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ook speechless and unable to move Hand or Foot. He had laid his sword by him; which these unhap|py spectres, did strive much to wrest from him; only he held too fast for them. He then grew able <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o call the People of his house; but altho' they heard him, yet they had not power to speak or stirr, until <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> last, one of the people crying out, <HI>what's the mat|ter!</HI> the spectres all vanished.</P>
<P N="9">IX. <HI>Samuel Shattock</HI> testify'd, That in the Year 168O. this <HI>Bridget Bishop,</HI> often came to his house upon such frivolous and foolish errands, that they suspected she came indeed with a purpose of mis||chief. Presently whereupon his eldest child, which was of as promising Health &amp; Sense, as any child of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Age, began to droop exceedingly; &amp; the oftener that <HI>Bishop</HI> came to the House, the worse grew the Child. As the Child would be standing at the Door, he would be thrown and bruised against the Stones, by an Invisible Hand, and in like sort knock his Face a|gainst the sides of the House, and bruise it after a miserable manner. Afterwards this <HI>Bishop</HI> would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ing him things to Dy, whereof he could not Ima|gine any use; and when she paid him a piece of Money, the Purse and Money were unaccountably <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">nveyed out of a Lock'd box, and never seen more. The Child was immediately hereupon taken with terrible fit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, whereof his Friends thought he
<PB N="110" REF="000657_0142_0FA9A2CBF03A15A8">
would have dyed: indeed he did almost nothing but cry and Sleep for several Months together: and at length his understanding was utterly taken away. Among other Symptoms of an Inchantment upon him, one was, that there was a Board in the Gar|den, whereon he would walk; and all the invitati|ons in the world could never fetch him off. About Seventeen or Eighteen years after, there came a Stranger to <HI>Shattocks</HI> House, who seeing the Child&punc; said, <HI>This poor Child is Bewitched; and you have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Neighbour living not far off, who is a Witch.</HI> He ad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ded, <HI>Your Neighbour has had a falling out with you<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Wife; and she said in her Heart, your Wife is a proud Woman, and she would bring down her Pride in this Child:</HI> He then Remembred, that <HI>Bishop</HI> had parted from his Wife in muttering and menacing Terms, a little before the Child was taken Ill. The above|said Stranger would needs carry the Bewitched Boy with him, to <HI>Bishops</HI> House, on pretence of buying a pot of Cyder. The Woman Entertain|ed him in furious manner; and flew also upon the Boy, scratching his Face till the Blood came, and saying, <HI>Thou Rogue, what? dost thou bring this Fel|low here to plague me</HI>? Now it seems the man had said before he went, that he would fetch Blood of <HI>her.</HI> Ever after the Boy was follow'd with grie|vous Fits, which the Doctors themselves generally ascribed unto <HI>Withcraft</HI>; and wherein he would b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> thrown still into the <HI>Fire</HI> or the <HI>Water,</HI> if he were not constantly look'd after; and it was verily be|lieved that <HI>Bishop</HI> was the cause of it.</P>
<P N="10"><PB N="111" REF="000657_0143_0FA9A2CCB0659278">X. <HI>John Louder</HI> testify'd, that upon some little controversy with <HI>Bishop</HI> about her fowles, going well to Bed, he did awake in the Night by moon|light, and did see clearly the likeness of this wo|man grievously oppressing him; in which miserable condition she held him unable to help him self, till <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ear Day. He told <HI>Bishop</HI> of this; but she deny'd it, and threatned him, very much. Quickly after this, being at home on a Lords Day, with the doors <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">utt about him, he saw a Black Pig approach him; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> which he going to kick, it vanished away. Im|mediately after, sitting down, he saw a Black thing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ump in at the Window, &amp; come &amp; stand before him. The Body, was like that of a Monkey, the Feet like a Cocks, but the Face much like a mans. He being so extreemly affrighted, that he could not speak; this Monster spoke to him, and said, <HI>I am a Messenger sent unto you, for I understand that you are in some Trouble of Mind, and if you will be ruled by me, you shalll want for nothing in this world.</HI> Whereupon he endeavoured to clap his hands upon it; but he could feel no substance, and it jum|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed out of the window again; but immediately came in by the Porch, though the Doors were shut, and said, <HI>You had better take my Counsel!</HI> He then struck at it with a stick, but struck only the Ground|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">el, and broke the Stick. The Arm with which he struck was presently Disenabled, and it vanished away. He presently went out at the Back-Door, and spyed, this <HI>Bishop</HI>&punc; in her Orchard, going toward her House; but he had not power to set one foot forward
<PB N="112" REF="000657_0144_0FA9A2CD70778820">
unto her. Whereupon returning into the House, he was immediately accosted by the Monster he had seen before; which Goblin was now going to Fly at him: whereat he cry'd out, <HI>The whole Ar|mour of God, be between me and you!</HI> So it sprang back, and flew over the Apple Tree; shaking ma|ny Apples off the Tree, in its flying over. At its Leap, it flung Dirt with its Feet, against the Stomach of the man; whereon he was then struck Dumb, and so continued for three Days together. Upon the producing of this Testimony, <HI>Bishop</HI> de|ny'd that she knew this Deponent: yet their two Orchards joined, and they had often had their Little Quarrels for some years together.</P>
<P N="11">XI. <HI>William Stacy,</HI> Testifyed, That, receiving Money of this <HI>Bishop,</HI> for work done by him, he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> gone but a matter of Three Rods from her, and looking for his money, found it unaccountably gone from him. Some time after, <HI>Bishop</HI> asked him whether his Father would grind her gri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t for her? He demanded why? she Reply'd, <HI>Because Folks count me a witch.</HI> He answered, <HI>No Question, but he will grind it for you.</HI> Being then gone about six Rods from her, with a small Load in his Cart, sud|denly the Off-wheel slump't and sunk down into an Hole upon plain ground, so that the Deponent, was forced to get help for the Recovering of the wheel. But stepping Back to look for the Hole which might give him this disaster, there was none at all to be found. Some time after&punc; he was wake<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="113" REF="000657_0145_0FA9A2CE36C2A958">
in the Night; but it seem'd as Light as Day, and he perfectly saw the shape of this <HI>Bishop,</HI> in the Room, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">roubling of him; but upon her going out, all was Dark again. He charg'd <HI>Bishop</HI> afterwards with it: and she deny'd it not; but was very angry. Quick|ly after, this Deponent having been threatned by <HI>Bishop,</HI> as he was in a dark Night going to the Barn, he was very suddenly taken or lifted from the ground, and thrown against a stone wall; After that, he was again hoisted up and thrown down a Bank, at the end of his House. After this again, passing by this <HI>Bishop,</HI> his Horse with a small load, striving to Draw, all his Gears flew to pieces, and the Cart fell down; and this deponent going then to lift a Bag of corn, of about two Bushels; could not budge it, with all his might.</P>
<P>Many other pranks, of this <HI>Bishops,</HI> this deponent was Ready to testify. He also testify'd, that he verily Believed, the said <HI>Bishop,</HI> was the Instrument of his Daughter, <HI>Priscilla's</HI> Death; of which suspi|cion, pregnant Reasons were assigned.</P>
<P N="12">XII. To Crown all, <HI>John Bly,</HI> and <HI>William Bly,</HI> Testify'd, That being Employ'd by <HI>Bridget Bi|shop,</HI> to help take down the Cellar-wall, of the old House, wherein she formerly Lived, they did in Holes of the said old Wall, find several <HI>Poppets,</HI> made up of Rags, and Hogs&punc; Brussels, with Headless Pins in them, the points being out|ward.

<P N="13"><PB N="114" REF="000657_0146_0FA9A2CEF306AEE0">XIII. One thing that made against the Prisoner was, her being evidently convicted of <HI>Gross Lying,</HI> in the Court, several Times, while she was making her Plea. But besides this, a Jury of Women, found a preternatural Teat upon her Body; but upon a second search, within Three or four Hours, there was no such thing to be seen. There was also an account of other people whom this woman had af|flicted. And there might have been many more, if they had been, enquired for. But there was no need of them.</P>
<P N="16">XVI. There was one very strange thing more, with which the Court was newly Entertained.

<P>It was then also noted in her, as in others like her, that if the Afflicted went to approach her, they were flung down to the Ground. And, when she was asked the Reason of it, she said, <HI>I cannot <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ell; it may be, the Devil bears me more Malice than another.</HI></P>
<P N="3">III. The Court accounted themselves Alarum'd by these things, to Enquire further into the Con|versation of the Prisoner; and see what there might occur to render these Accusations further credible. Whereupon, <HI>John Allen,</HI> of <HI>Salisbury,</HI> testify'd, That he refusing, because of the weak|ness of his Oxen, to Cart some Staves, at the re|quest of this <HI>Martin,</HI> she was displeased at it, and said, <HI>It had been as good that he had; for his Oxen should never do him much more Service.</HI> Whereup|on, this Deponent said, <HI>Dost thou threaten me, thou old Witch: I'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> throw thee into the Brook</HI>: Which to avoid, she flew over the Bridge, and escaped. But, as he was going home, one of his Oxen Tired, so
<PB N="117" REF="000657_0149_0FA9A2D12FAB9530">
that he was forced to Unyoke him, that he might get him home. He then put his Oxen, with ma|ny more, upon <HI>Salisbury</HI> Beach, where Cattle did use to get <HI>Flesh.</HI> In a few days, all the Oxen upon the Beach were found by their Tracks, to have run unto the mouth of <HI>Merrimack-River,</HI> and not returned; but the next day they were found come ashore upon <HI>Plum-Island.</HI> They that sought them, used all imaginable gentleness, but they would still run away with a violence that seem|ed wholly Diabolical, till they came near the mouth of <HI>Merrimack-River</HI>; when they ran right into the Sea, swimming as far as they could be seen. One of them then swam back again, with a swiftness, amazing to the Beholders, who stood ready to receive him, and help up his Tired Carcase: but the Beast ran furiously up into the Island, and from thence, thorough the Marishes, up into <HI>Newbury</HI> Town, and so up into the Woods; and there after a while found near <HI>Amesbury.</HI> So that, of Fourteen good Ox|en, there was only this saved: the Rest were all cast up, some in one place, and some in a|nother, Drowned.</P>
<P N="4">IV. <HI>John Atkinson</HI> Testify'd, That he Exchan|ged a Cow, with a Son of <HI>Susanna Martins,</HI> whereat she muttered, and was unwilling he should have it. Going to Receive this Cow, tho' he Hamstring'd her, and Halter'd her, she of a Tame Creature grew so mad, that they
<PB N="118" REF="000657_0150_0FA9A2D2EBFCC1E8">
could scarce get her along. She broke all the Ropes that were fastned unto her, and though she were Ty'd fast unto a Tree, yet she made her Es|cape, and gave them such further Trouble, as they could ascribe to no cause but Witchcraft.</P>
<P N="5">V. <HI>Bernard Peache</HI> testify'd, That being in Bed, on a Lords-day<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">Night, he heard a scrabbling at the Window, whereat he then saw, <HI>Susanna Mar|tin</HI> come in, and jump down upon the Floor. She took hold of this Deponents Feet, and drawing his Body up into an Heap, she lay upon him, near Two Hours; in all which time he could neither speak nor stirr. At length, when he could begin to move, he laid hold on her Hand, and pulling it up to his mouth, he bit three of her Fingers, as he judged, unto the Bone. Whereupon she went from the Chamber, down the Stairs, out at the Door. This Deponent thereupon called unto the people of the House, to advise them, of what pas|sed; and he himself did follow her. The people saw her not; but there being a Bucket at the Left<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> hand of the Door, there was a drop of Blood found on it; and several more drops of Blood up|on the Snow newly fallen abroad. There was likewise the print of her two Feet just without the Threshold; but no more sign of any Footing fur|ther off.</P>
<P>At another time this Deponent was desired by the Prisoner, to come unto an Husking of Corn, at her House; and she said, <HI>If he did not come, it
<PB N="119" REF="000657_0151_0FA9A2D393B7D230">
were better that he did</HI>! He went not; but the Night following, <HI>Susanna Martin,</HI> as he judged, and another came towards him. One of them said, <HI>Here he is</HI>! but he having a Quarter-staff, made a Blovv at them. The Roof of the Barn, broke his Blow; but following them to the Window, he made another Blow at them, and struck them down; yet they got up, and got out, and he saw no more of them.</P>
<P>About this time, there was a Rumour about the Town, that <HI>Martin</HI> had a Broken Head; but the Deponent could say nothing to that.</P>
<P>The said <HI>Peache</HI> also testify'd, the Bevvitching of Cattle to Death, upon <HI>Martins</HI> Discontents.</P>
<P N="6">VI. <HI>Robert Downer</HI> testifyed, That this Prisoner being some years ago prosecuted at Court for a Witch, he then said unto her, <HI>He believed she was a Witch.</HI> Whereat she being Dissatisfied, Said, <HI>That some Shee-Devil would Shortly fetch him away</HI>! Which words were heard by others, as well as himself. The Night following, as he lay in his Bed, there came in at the Window, the likeness of a <HI>Cat,</HI> which Flew upon him, took fast hold of his Throat, lay on him a considerable while, and almost killed him. At length he remembred, what <HI>Susanna Martin,</HI> had threatned the Day before; and with much striving he cryed out, <HI>Avoid, thou Shee-Devil! In the Name of God the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, Avoid!</HI> Whereupon it left him, leap'd on the Floor, and Flew out at the Window.</P>
<P><PB N="120" REF="000657_0152_0FA9A2D4372AF878">And there also came in several Testimonies, that before ever <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> Accident, <HI>Susanna Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">n</HI> and her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">amily, had related, <HI>How this</HI> Downer <HI>had been Handled!</HI></P>
<P N="7">VII. <HI>John Kembal,</HI> testifyed, that <HI>Susanna Martin,</HI> upon a Causeless Disgust, had threatened him, a|bout a certain Cow of his, <HI>That she should never do him any more Good</HI>: and it came to pass accordingly. For soon aster the Cow was found stark Dead on the dry Ground; without any Distemper to be dis|cerned upon her. Upon which he was followed with a strange Death upon more of his Cattle, whereof he lost in One Spring to the value of Thir|ty Pounds. But the said <HI>John Kemb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l</HI> had a further Testimony to give in against the Prisoner which was truly admirable.</P>
<P>Being desirous to furnish himself with a Dog, he applyed himself to buy one of this <HI>Martin,</HI> who had a Bitch with Whelps in her House. But she not let|ting him have his Choice, he said, he would supply himself then at one <HI>Blezdels.</HI> Having mark'd a pup|py, which he lik'd at <HI>Blezdels,</HI> he met <HI>George Martin,</HI> the Husband of the prisoner, going by, who asked him, <HI>Whether he would no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> have one of his Wives Pup|pies</HI>; and he answered, <HI>No.</HI> The same Day, one <HI>Edmund Eliot,</HI> being at <HI>Martins House,</HI> heard <HI>George Martin</HI> relate, where this <HI>Kembal</HI> had been, and what he had said. Whereupon <HI>Susanna Martin</HI> replyed, <HI>If I live, I'll give him Puppies enough!</HI> Within a few dayes after, this <HI>Kembal</HI> coming out of the Woods,
<PB N="121" REF="000657_0153_0FA9A2D4F5AAC500">
there arose a little Black Cloud, in the <HI>N.W.</HI> and <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">embal</HI> immediately felt a Force upon him, which made him not able to avoid running upon the stumps of Trees, that were before him, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">beit, he had a broad, plain Cart way, before him; but tho' he had his Ax also on his Shoulder to endanger him in his Falls, he could not forbear going out of his way to tumble over them. When he came below the Meeting-House, there appeared unto him, a little thing like a <HI>Puppy,</HI> of a Darkish Colour; and it shot Backwards and forwards between his Leggs. He had the Courage to use all possible Endeavours of Cutting it, with his Ax; but he could not Hit it; the Puppy gave a jump from him, and went, as to him, it seem'd into the Ground. Going a little fur|ther, there appeared unto him a Black Puppy, some|what bigger than the first; but as Black as a Cole. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ts motions were quicker than those of his Ax; it Flew at his Belly- and away; then at his Throat&punc; so, over his Shoulder one way, and then over his Shoulder another way. His heart now began to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ail him, and he thought the Dog would have Tore his Throat out. But he recovered himself, and called upon God in his Distress; and Naming the Name of JESUS CHRIST, it Vanished away at once. The Deponent Spoke not one Word of these Accidents, for fear of affrighting his wife. But the next Morning, <HI>Edmund Eliot,</HI> going into <HI>Martins</HI> house, this woman asked him where <HI>Kembal</HI> was? He Replyed, <HI>At home, a bed, for ought he knew.</HI> She return<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d, <HI>They say, he was frighted last Night. Eliot</HI>
<PB N="122" REF="000657_0154_0FA9A2D5B629E010">
asked <HI>With what?</HI> She answered, <HI>With Puppies. Eliot</HI> asked, <HI>Where she heard of it, for he had heard nothing of it!</HI> She rejoined, <HI>About the Town.</HI> Altho, <HI>Kembal</HI> had mentioned the Matter to no Creature Li|ving.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. <HI>William Brown</HI> testify'd, that Heaven have|ing blessed him with a most Pious and prudent wife, this wife of his, one day mett with <HI>Susanna Martin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> but when she approch'd just unto her <HI>Martin,</HI> va|nished out of sight, and left her extremely affrighted. After which time, the said <HI>Martin,</HI> often appear'd unto her, giving her no little trouble; &amp; when she did come, she was visited with Birds that sorely peck't and Prick'd her; and sometimes, a Bunch, like a pullets egg would Rise in her throat, ready to Choak her, till she cry'd out, <HI>Witch, you shan't Choak me</HI>! While this good Woman was in this Extre|mity, the Church appointed a Day of Prayer, on her behalf; whereupon her Trouble ceas'd; she saw not <HI>Martin</HI> as formerly; and the Church, in|stead of their Fast, gave Thanks for her Delive|rance. But a considerable while after, she being Summoned to give in some Evidence at the Court, against this <HI>Martin,</HI> quickly thereupon, this <HI>Martin</HI> came behind her, while she was milking her Cow, and said unto her, <HI>For thy defaming me at her Court, I'l make thee the miserablest Creature in the World.</HI> Soon after which, she fell into a strange kind of Distemper, and became horribly Frantick, and un|capable of any Reasonable Action; the Physici|ans

declaring, that her Distemper was preternatu|ral, and that some Devil had certainly Bewitched <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">er; and in that Condition she now remained.</P>
<P N="9">IX. <HI>Sarah Atkinson</HI> testify'd, That <HI>Susanna Mar|tin</HI> came from <HI>Amesbury,</HI> to their House at <HI>New|bury,</HI> in an extraordinary Season, when it was not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> for any one to Travel. She came (as she said, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nto <HI>Atkinson,</HI>) all that long way on Foot. She brag'd, and show'd, how dry she was; nor could <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t be perceived that so much as the Soles of her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hoes were wet. <HI>Atkinson</HI> was amazed at it; and professed, that she should her self have been wet <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">p to the knees, if she had then came so far; but <HI>Martin</HI> reply'd, <HI>She scorn'd to be Drabbled!</HI> It was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oted, that this Testimony upon her Trial, cast <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">er into a very singular Confusion.</P>
<P N="10">10. <HI>John Pressy,</HI> testify'd, That being one Even|ing very unaccountably Bewildred, near a field of <HI>Martins,</HI> and several times, as one under an En|chantment, returning to the place he had left, at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ength he saw a marvellous Light, about the Big|ness of an Half-Bushel, near two Rod, out of the way. He went, and struck at it with a Stick, and laid it on with all his might. He gave it near forty blows; and felt it a palpable substance. But going from it, his Heels were struck up, and he was laid with his Back on the Ground: Sliding as he thought, into a Pit; from whence he recover'd, by taking hold on the Bush: altho' afterwards he
<PB N="124" REF="000657_0156_0FA9A2D72FCCC548">
could find no such Pit in the place. Having after his Recovery, gone five or six Rod, he saw <HI>Susan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">na Martin</HI> standing on his Left-hand, as the Light had done before; but they changed no words with one another. He could scarce find his House in his Return; but at length he got home, extreamly affrighted. The next day, it was upon Enquir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> understood, that <HI>Martin</HI> was in a miserable condi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tion by pains and hurts that were upon her.</P>

<P N="2">II.

what they said. Nevertheless, this Evidence was not produced against the Prisoner at the Bar, inas|much as there was other Evidence enough to pro|ceed upon.</P>
<P N="3">III. <HI>Benjamin Abbot,</HI> gave in his Testimony, that last <HI>March</HI> was a twelve month, this <HI>Carrier</HI> was very Angry with him, upon laying out some Land, near her Husbands: Her Expressions in this Anger, were, <HI>That she would stick as close to</HI> Abbot, <HI>as the Bark stuck to the Tree, and that he should Repent of it, afore seven years came to an end, so as Doctor</HI> Prescot <HI>should never cure him.</HI> These words were heard by others, besides <HI>Abbot</HI> himself; who also heard her say, <HI>She would hold his Nose as close to the Grindstone, as ever it was held since his Name was</HI> Abbot. Pre|sently after this, he was taken with a swelling in his Foot, and then with a pain in his side: and exceedingly Tormented. It bred unto a sore, which was Lanced by Doctor <HI>Prescot,</HI> and several Gallons of Corruption ran out of it. For six weeks it con|tinued very bad; and then another sore bred in his Groin, which was also Lanc'd by Doctor <HI>Pres|cot.</HI> Another Sore then bred in his Groin, which was likewise Cut, and put him to very great Mi|sery. He was brought unto Deaths Door, and so remained until <HI>Carrier</HI> was taken, and carried away by the Constable; from which very day, he began to mend, and so grew better every day, and is well ever since.</P>
<P><HI>Sarah Abbot</HI> also his Wife testify'd, that her Hus|band
<PB N="135" REF="000657_0167_0FA9A2DF7405D730">
was not only all this while Afflicted in his Body, but also that strange, extraordinary and un|accountable Calamities befel his Cattel; their Death being such as they could guess at no Natu|ral Reason for.</P>
<P N="4">IV. <HI>Allin Toothaker</HI> testify'd, That <HI>Richard,</HI> the Son of <HI>Martha Carrier,</HI> having some Difference with him, pull'd him down by the Hair of the Head. When he Rose again, he was going to strike at <HI>Richard Carrier</HI>; but fell down flat on his Back to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he ground, and had not power to stir hand or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oot, until he told <HI>Carrier</HI> he yielded; and the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e saw the Shape of <HI>Martha Carrier,</HI> go off his Breast.</P>
<P>This <HI>Toothaker,</HI> had Received a Wound in the Wars; and he now testify'd, that <HI>Martha Carrier</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">old him, <HI>He should never be Cured.</HI> Just afore the Apprehending of <HI>Carrier,</HI> he could thrust a knitting Needle into his Wound, four Inches Deep; but presently after her being Siezed, he was throughly Healed.</P>
<P>He further testify'd, That when <HI>Carrier</HI> and he sometimes were at variance, she would clap her hands at him, and say, <HI>He should get nothing by it</HI>; Whereupon he several times lost his Cattle, by strange Deaths, whereof no Natural Causes could be given.</P>
<P N="5">V. <HI>John Rogger</HI> also testifyed, That upon the threatning words of this malicious <HI>Carrier,</HI> his

Cattle would be strangely Bewitched; as was more particularly then described.</P>
<P N="6">VI. <HI>Samuel Preston</HI> testify'd, that about two years ago, having some Difference with <HI>Martha Carrier,</HI> he lost a Cow in a strange Preternatural unusual manner; and about a month after this, the said <HI>Carrier,</HI> having again some Difference with him, she told him; <HI>He had Lately lost a Cow, and it should not be long before he Lost another!</HI> which accordingly came to Pass; for he had a Thriving and well-kept Cow, which without any known cause quickly fell down and Dy'd.</P>
<P N="7">VII. <HI>Phebe Chandler</HI> testify'd, that about a Fort|night before the apprehension of <HI>Martha Carrier,</HI> on a Lords-Day, while the Psalm was singing, in the Church, this <HI>Carrier</HI> then took her by the shoulder and shaking her, asked her, <HI>where she Lived?</HI> she made her no Answer, although as <HI>Carrier,</HI> who li|ved next door to her Fathers House, could not in reason but know who she was. Quickly after this, as she was at several times crossing the Fields, she heard a voice, that she took to be <HI>Martha Carriers,</HI> and it seem'd as if it was over her Head. The voice told her, <HI>she should within two or three dayes be Poison|ed.</HI> Accordingly, within such a Little time, One Half of her Right Hand, became greatly swollen, and very painful; as also part of her Face; whereof she can give no account how it came. It continued very <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ad for some dayes; and several
<PB N="137" REF="000657_0169_0FA9A2E0EFA46558">
times since, she has had a great pain in her Breast; and been so siezed on her Legs, that she has hardly been able to go. She added, that lately, going well to the House of God, <HI>Richard,</HI> the Son of <HI>Martha Carrier,</HI> Look'd very earnestly upon her, and immediately her hand, which had formerly been poisoned, as is abovesaid, began to pain her greately, and she had a strange Burning at her sto|mach; but was then struck deaf, so that she could not hear any of the prayer, or singing, till the two or three last words of the Psalme.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. One <HI>Foster,</HI> who confessed her own Share in the Witchcraft for which the Prisoner stood in|dicted, affirm'd, That she had seen the Prisoner at some of their <HI>Witch-Meetings,</HI> and that it was this <HI>Carrier,</HI> who perswaded her to be a Witch. She confessed, That the Devil carry'd them on a Pole, to a Witch-Meeting; but the Pole broke, and she hanging about <HI>Carriers</HI> Neck, they both fell down, and she then Received an Hurt by the Fall, whereof she was not at this very time Recovered.</P>

<HEAD>The First CURIOSITIE.</HEAD>
<P N="1">I. Tis very Remarkable to see what an Impious &amp; Impudent <HI>Imitation</HI> of Divine Things, is Api<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ly affected by the Devil, in several of those matters, whereof the Confessions of our <HI>Witches,</HI> and the Af|flictions of our <HI>Sufferers</HI> have informed us.</P>
<P>That Reverend and Excellent Person, Mr. <HI>John Higginson,</HI> in My Conversation with him, Once in|vited me to this Reflection; That the Indians which came from far to settle about <HI>Mexico,</HI> were in their Progress to that Settlement, under a Conduct of the <HI>Devil,</HI> very strangely Emulating what the Blessed God gave to <HI>Israel</HI> in the Wilderness.</P>
<P><HI>Acosta,</HI> is our Author for it, <Q>That the Devil in their Idol <HI>Vitzlipultzli,</HI> governed that mighty Nati|on. He commanded them to leave their Country, promising to make them <HI>Lords</HI> over all the Provin|ces possessed by <HI>Six</HI> other Nations of Indians, and give them a Land abounding with all precious things. They went forth, carrying their Idol with them, in a Coffer of <HI>Reeds,</HI> supported by Four of their Principal <HI>Priests</HI>; with whom he still <HI>Discoursed,</HI> in secret; Revealing to them the Suc|cesses, and Accidents of their way. He advised them, when to <HI>March,</HI> and where to <HI>Stay,</HI> and with|out his Commandment they moved not. The first thing they did, wherever they came, was to
<PB N="140" REF="000657_0172_0FA9A2E3E7BF81B0">
Erect a <HI>Tabernacle,</HI> for their False God; which they set always in the midst of their Camp, and there placed the <HI>Ark</HI> upon an <HI>Altar.</HI> When they, Tired with pains, talked of, <HI>proceeding no f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rther</HI> in their Journey, than a certain pleasant Stage, whereto they were arrived, this Devil in one Night, horribly kill'd them that had started this Talk, by pulling out their Hearts. And so they passed on, till they came to <HI>Mexico.</HI></Q></P>
<P>The Devil which <HI>then</HI> thus imitated what was in the Church of the <HI>Old Testament,</HI> now among <HI>Us</HI> would Imitate the Affayrs of the Church in the <HI>New.</HI> The <HI>Witches</HI> do say, that they form themselves much after the manner of <HI>Congregati|onal Churches</HI>; and that they have a <HI>Baptism</HI> and a <HI>Supper,</HI> and <HI>Officers</HI> among them, abominably Resembling those of our Lord.</P>
<P>But there are many more of these Bloody <HI>I|mitations,</HI> if the Confessions of the <HI>Witches</HI> are to be Received; which I confess, ought to be but with very much of Caution.</P>
<P>What is their striking down with a fierce <HI>Look</HI>? What is their making of the Afflicted <HI>Rise,</HI> with a touch of their <HI>Hand</HI>? What is their Transportation thro' the <HI>Air?</HI> What is their Tra|velling in <HI>Spirit,</HI> while their Body is cast into a Trance? What is their causing of <HI>Gatt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"></HI> to run mad and perish? What is their Entring their Names in a <HI>Book?</HI> What is their coming toge|ther from all parts, at the Sound of a <HI>Trumpet?</HI>
<PB N="141" REF="000657_0173_0FA9A2E402012F00">
What is their Appearing sometimes Cloathed with <HI>Light</HI> or <HI>Fire</HI> upon them? What is their Covering of themselves and their Instruments with <HI>Invisibility?</HI> But a Blasphemous Imitation of certain things recorded about our Saviour, or His Prophets, or the Saints in the Kingdom of God.</P>

<P>There are certain people, very <HI>Dogmatical</HI> about these matters; but I'l give them only these Three<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">Bones to Pick.</P>
<P>First, One of our Bewitched people, was cruelly assaulted by a <HI>Spectre</HI>&punc; that, she said, ran at her with a <HI>Spindle</HI>: tho' no body else in the Room, could see either, the <HI>Spectre</HI> or the <HI>Spindle.</HI> A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> last, in her miseries, giving a Snatch at the <HI>Spectre,</HI> she pull'd the <HI>Spindle</HI> away; and it was no sooner got into her hand, but the other peo|ple then present, beheld, that it was indeed a Real, Proper, Iron <HI>Spindle,</HI> belonging they knew, to whom; which when they Lock'd up very safe, it was nevertheless by <HI>Daemons</HI> unaccountably stole away, to do further mischief.</P>
<P>Secondly. Another of our Bewitched People, was haunted with a most abusive <HI>Spectre,</HI> which came to her, she said, with a <HI>Sheet</HI> about her. After she had undergone a deal of Teaze, from the Annoyances of the <HI>Spectre,</HI> she gave a Violent Snatch at the <HI>Sheet</HI> that was upon it; wherefrom she tore a Corner, which in her Hand immediate|ly became <HI>Visible</HI> to a Roomful of Spectators; a

For which cause, I cannot express my self in better terms, than those of a most Wor|thy Person, who lives near the present Center of these things. <HI>The Mind of God in these matters, is to be carefully look'd into, with due Circumspection, that Satan deceive us not with his Devices, who transforms himself into an Angel of Light, and may pretend <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ustice, and yet intend Mischief.</HI> But on the other side, if the Storm of Justice do now fall only on the Heads of those Guilty <HI>Witches</HI> and <HI>Wretches</HI> which have defiled our Land, <HI>How Happy</HI>!</P>
<P>The Execution of some that have lately Dyed, has been immediately attended, with a strange De|liverance of some, that had lain for many years, in a most sad Condition, under, they knew not whose <HI>Evil Hands.</HI> As I am abundantly satisfy'd, That many of the Self-Murders committed here, have been the effects of a Cruel, and Bloody, <HI>Witchcraft</HI> leting fly <HI>Daemons</HI> upon the miserable <HI>Seneca's</HI>&punc; thus, it has been admirable unto me to see&punc; how a Devillish <HI>Witchcraft</HI> sending Devils upon them, has, driven many poor people to <HI>Despair,</HI> and persecu|ted their minds, with such Buzzes of <HI>Atheism</HI> and <HI>Blasphemy,</HI> as has made them even run <HI>Distract<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">

<P><Q>The Last Night my Daughter <HI>Ann,</HI> was grievously Tormented by Witches, Threatning that she should be <HI>Pressed</HI> to Death, before <HI>Giles Cory.</HI> But thro' the Goodness of a Gracious God, she had at last a little Respite. Whereupon there appeared unto her (sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> said) a man in a Winding Sheet; who told her that <HI>Giles Cor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> had Murdered him, by <HI>Pressing</HI> him to Death with his Feet; but that the Devil there appear|ed unto him, and Covenanted with him, and promised him, <HI>He should not be Hanged.</HI> The Apparition said&punc; God Hardened his Heart; that he should not hearken to the Advice of the Court, and so Dy an easy Death&punc; because as it said, <HI>It must be done to him as he has done to me.</HI> The Apparition also said, That <HI>Giles Cory,</HI> was carry'd to the Court for this, and that the Jury had found the Murder, and that her Father knew the man, and the thing was done before she was born. Now Sir, This is not a little strange to us; that no body should Remember these things, all the while that <HI>Giles Cory</HI> was in Prison, and so often before the Court. For all people now Remember very well, (and the Records of the Court also mention it,) That about Seventeen Years ago, <HI>Giles Cory</HI> kept a man in his House, that was almost a Natural Fool; which Man Dy'd suddenly. A Jury was Impannel'd upon him, among whom was Dr. <HI>Zorobbabel En<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">icot</HI>; who found the man bruised to Death, and having clodders of Blood about his Heart. The Jury, whereof several are yet alive, brought in the man Murdered; but as if some Enchantment had hin|dred the Prosecution of the Matter, the Court Proceed|ed not against <HI>Giles Cory,</HI> tho' it cost him a great deal of Mony to get off.

I</HI> shall only Single out a few of the more Memorable passages therein Occuring; and where it agrees with what happen|ed among ourselves, my Reader shall understand, by my inserting a Word of every such thing in <HI>Black Letter.</HI></P>
<P N="1">I. It was in the Year 1669. and 1670. That at <HI>Mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ra</HI> in <HI>Sweedland,</HI> the <HI>Devils</HI> by the help of <HI>Witches,</HI> com|mitted a most horrible outrage. Among other Instances of Hellish Tyranny there exercised, One was, That Hun|dreds of their Children, were usually in the Night fetcht from their Lodgings, to a Diabolical Rendezvouz, at a place they called, <HI>Blockula,</HI> where the Monsters that so Spirited them, <HI>Tempted</HI> them all manner of Ways to
<PB N="148" REF="000657_0180_0FA9A2E93AA95580">
<HI>Associate</HI> with them. Yea, such was the perillous Growth of this <HI>Witchcraft,</HI> that Persons of Quality began to send their Children into other Countries to avoid it.</P>
<P N="2"><HI>II.</HI> The Inhabitants had earnestly sought God by <HI>Pray|er</HI>; and <HI>Yet</HI> their Affliction <HI>Continued.</HI> Whereupon <HI>Iudges</HI> had a Special <HI>Commission</HI>; to find and root out the Hellish Crew; and the rather, because another Coun|ty in the Kingdom, which had been so molested, was De|livered upon the Execution of the <HI>Witches.</HI></P>
<P N="3"><HI>III.</HI> The <HI>Cxamination,</HI> was begun with a Day of <HI>Humiliation,</HI> appointed by Authority. Whereupon the Commissioners <HI>Consulting,</HI> how they might resist such a Dangerous Flood, the <HI>Suffering Children,</HI> were first Examined; and tho' they were Questioned <HI>One</HI> by <HI>One</HI> apart, yet their <HI>Declarations All Agreed.</HI> The <HI>Witches</HI> Accus'd in these Declarations, were then Exa|mined; and tho' at first they obstinately <HI>Denied,</HI> yet at length many of them Ingenuously <HI>Confessed</HI> the Truth of what the Children had said; owning with Tears, that the <HI>Devil,</HI> whom they call'd, <HI>L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eyta,</HI> had <HI>Scopt</HI> their <HI>Mouths</HI>; but he being now <HI>Gone</HI> from them, they could <HI>No Longer Conceal</HI> the Business. The things by them <HI>Acknowleged,</HI> most wonderfully <HI>Agreed</HI> with what other Witches in other places had Confessed.</P>
<P N="4"><HI>IV.</HI> They Confessed, That they did use to <HI>Call upon</HI> the <HI>Devil,</HI> who thereupon would <HI>Carry</HI> them away, o|ver the Tops of Houses, to a Green Meddow, where they gave themselves unto him. Only one of them said, That sometimes the <HI>Devil</HI> only took away her <HI>Strength,</HI> Leaving her <HI>Body</HI> on the Ground; but she went at o|ther times in <HI>Body</HI> too.</P>
<P N="5"><HI>V.</HI> Their manner was to come into the <HI>Chambers</HI> of people, and fetch away their Children upon Beasts, of the Devils providing: promising <HI>Fine Clothes</HI> and other
<PB N="149" REF="000657_0181_0FA9A2E9F09E6170">
Fine Things unto them, to Inveagle them. They said, They never had power to do thus, till of Late; but now the Devil did <HI>Plague</HI> and <HI>Beat</HI> them, if they did not gratifie him, in this piece of Mischief. They said, They made use of all sorts of <HI>Instruments</HI> in their Journeys! Of <HI>Men,</HI> of <HI>Beasts,</HI> of <HI>Posts</HI>; the <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n</HI> they commonly laid asleep at the place, whereto they Rode them; &amp; if the Children mentioned the <HI>Names</HI> of them that Stole them away, they were miserably <HI>Scourged</HI> for it, until some of them were killed. The <HI>Iudges</HI> found the <HI>Marks</HI> of the Lashes on some of them; but the Witches said, <HI>They would Quickly vanish.</HI> Moreover the Children would be in <HI>strange Fits,</HI> after they were brought home, from these Transportations.</P>
<P N="6"><HI>VI.</HI> The <HI>First Thing,</HI> they said, they were to do at <HI>Bl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ckula,</HI> was to <HI>Give Themselves</HI> unto the Devil, and <HI>Vow</HI> that they would serve him. Hereupon, they <HI>Cut their Fingers,</HI> and with <HI>Blood,</HI> writ their <HI>Names</HI> in his <HI>Book.</HI> And he also caused them to be <HI>Baptised</HI> by such <HI>Priests,</HI> as he had, in this Horrid Company. In <HI>some</HI> of them, the <HI>Mark</HI> of the <HI>Cat Finger</HI> was to be found. They said, That the Devil gave <HI>Meat</HI> and <HI>Drink,</HI> as to <HI>Them,</HI> so to the Children they brought with them: that afterwards their Custome was to <HI>Dance</HI> before him; and <HI>Swear</HI> and <HI>Curse</HI> most horribly. They said, That the De|vil show'd them a great, Frightful, Cruel <HI>Dragon,</HI> telling them, <HI>If they Confessed any Thing,</HI> he would let loose that Great Devil upon them. They added, That the Devil had a <HI>Church</HI>; and that when the <HI>Iudges</HI> were coming, he told them, <HI>He would kill them all</HI>; and that some of them had <HI>Attempted to Murder the Iudges,</HI> but <HI>Could Not.</HI></P>
<P N="7"><HI>VII.</HI> Some of the <HI>Children,</HI> talked much of a <HI>White Angel,</HI> which did use to <HI>Forbid</HI> them, what the Devil
<PB N="150" REF="000657_0182_0FA9A2EAE3A92A68">
had Bid them to do; and <HI>Assure</HI> them that these Doings would <HI>Not Last Long</HI>; but that what had been done was permitted for the wickedness of the People. This <HI>White Angel,</HI> would sometimes rescue the Children, from <HI>Going in,</HI> with the Witches.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. The Witches confessed many mischiefs done by them; declaring with what kind of <HI>Enchanted Tools,</HI> they did their Mischiefs. They sought especially to <HI>Kill the Mi|ni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ter,</HI> of <HI>E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">fdale,</HI> but could not. But some of them said, That such as they wounded, would <HI>Be recovered,</HI> upon or before their Execution.</P>
<P N="9">IX. The <HI>Iudges</HI> would fain have seen them show some of their <HI>Tricks</HI>; but they Unanimously Declared, That <HI>Since they had Confessed,</HI> all, they found all their <HI>Witch|craft gone</HI>; and the Devil then <HI>Appeared very Terri|ble</HI> unto them, threatning with an <HI>Iron Fork,</HI> to thrust them into a Burning Pi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, if they persisted in their Confessi|on.</P>
<P N="10">X. There were discovered no less than <HI>Threescore and ten</HI> Witches: in One Village, <HI>Three and Twenty</HI> of which <HI>Freely Confessing</HI> their Crimes, were condemned to Dy. The rest, (<HI>One</HI> pretending she was with <HI>Child</HI>) were sent to <HI>Fahlun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> where most of them were afterwards ex|ecuted. Fifteen Children, which confessed themselves en|gaged in this Witchery, Dyed as the Rest. Six and Thirty of them, between Nine and Sixteen years of Age, who had been less guilty, were forced to run the Gantlet, and be lashed on their hands, once a Week, for a year together. Twenty more who had less inclination to these Infernal en|terprises, were lashed with Rods upon their Hands for three Sundays together, at the Church-Door. The number of the seduced Children, was about Three Hundred. This course, together with Weekly <HI>Prayers,</HI> in all the Church|es thro' the Kingdome, issued in the Deliverance of the Countrey.</P>
<P N="11"><PB N="151" REF="000657_0183_0FA9A2EC81DBFB90">XI. The most Accomplished Dr. <HI>Horneck</HI> inserts a most wise cauti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n, in his preface to this Narrative; saies he, <HI>There is no Publick Calamity, but some Ill people, will serve themselves of the sad providence, and make use of it for their own Ends; as Thieves, when an House or Town is on Fire, will steal what they can.</HI> And he mentions a Remarkable Story of a Young Woman, at <HI>Stockholm,</HI> in the year, 1676. Who accused her own Mother of being a Witch; and swore positively, that she had carried her away in the Night. The poor Woman was burnt upon it: professing her In|nocency to the last. But tho' she had been an Ill Woman, yet it afterwards prov'd, that she was not <HI>such</HI> an one; for her Daughter came to the Judges, with hideous Lamentations, Confessing, That she had wronged her Mother, out of a wicked spite against her; whereupon the Judges gave order for her Execution too.</P>

<P>There were especially Three <HI>Remarkable</HI> Assaults of <HI>Temptations,</HI> which the Devil it seems, visibly made upon our Lord; after he had been more Invisibly for Forty Dayes together <HI>Tempting</HI> of that Holy One; and we may make a few Distinct <HI>Remarks</HI> upon them all.</P>
<P>&sect; The first of our Lords three Temptations is thus related, in Mat. 4.3. <HI>He was an Hungry; and when the Tempter came to Him, he said, If thou be the Son of God Command that these Stones be made Bread.</HI></P>
<P>From whence, take these <HI>Remarks.</HI></P>

<P N="2"><HI>II.</HI> The Devil does often manage his <HI>Temptations,</HI> by urging of our <HI>Necessities.</HI> Our Lord, was thus by the Devil bawl'd upon; <HI>You want Bread; and you<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l Starve, if in my way you get it not.</HI> The Devil will show some For|bidden Thing unto us, and plead concerning it, as of <HI>Bread</HI> we use to say, <HI>It must be had. Necessity</HI> has a won|derful Compulsion in it. You may see what <HI>Necessity</HI> will do, if you read in Deut. 28.56. <HI>The Tender and the Deli|cate Woman among you, her eye shall be evil towards the Children what she shall Bear, for she shall eat them for want of all Things.</HI> The Devil will perswade us that there is a <HI>Necessity</HI> of our doing what he does pro|pound unto us; and then tho' the <HI>Laws</HI> of God about us were so many <HI>Walls</HI> of Stone, yet we shall break through them all. That little Inconvenience, of our coming to Beg our <HI>Bread,</HI> O what a fearful Repre|sentation does the Devil make of it! and when once the Devil scares us to think of a sinful thing. <HI>It must be done,</HI> we soon come to think, <HI>It <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ay be done.</HI> When the Devil has frighted us, into an Apprehension, that it is a <HI>Needful</HI> thing which we are prompted unto, he presently Engages all the Faculties of our Souls, to prove, that it may be a <HI>Lawful</HI> one. The <HI>Devil</HI> told <HI>Esau, You'l Dy if you don't Sell your Birthright</HI>; the De|vil

told <HI>Aaron, You'l pull all the People about your ears, if you do not countenance their Superstitions</HI>; and then they comply'd immediately.

<P N="3"><HI>III.</HI> The Divel does insinuate his most Horrible <HI>Temp|tations,</HI> with pretence, of much <HI>Friendship</HI> and <HI>Kindness</HI> for us. He seemed very unwilling that our Lord should want any thing that might be comfortable for him; but, he was a <HI>Divel</HI> still! The <HI>Divel</HI> flatters our Mother <HI>Eve,</HI> as if he was desirous to make her more Happy than her Maker did; but there was the <HI>Devil</HI> in that flattery&punc; <HI>Sub Ami|ci fallere Nomen</HI>;&mdash;to Salute men with profers to do all

<P N="4"><HI>IV.</HI> Things in themselves <HI>Allowable</HI> and <HI>Convenient,</HI> are oftentimes turned into sore <HI>Temptations</HI> by the De|vil. He press'd our Lord unto the making of <HI>Bread</HI>; Why, that very thing was afterwards done by our Lord, in the Miracles of the <HI>Loaves</HI>; and yet it is now a moti|on of the <HI>Devil, Pray, make thy self a Little Bread.</HI> The Devil will frequently put men by, from the doing of a <HI>Seasonable Duty</HI>; but how? truly by putting us upon another <HI>Duty,</HI> which may be at that juncture a most <HI>&V;nseasonable</HI> Thing. It is said in Eccl. 8.5. <HI>A Wise mans heart discerns both Time and Judgment.</HI> The <HI>Ill-Timing</HI> of Good Things, is One of the chief Intregues, which the Devil has to Prosecute. The Devil himself, will Egg us on to many a <HI>Duty</HI>; and why so? but because at that very Time a more proper and Useful Duty, will have a <HI>Supersedeas</HI> given thereunto. And, thus there are many Things, whereof we can say, though no more tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> this&punc; yet so much as this, <HI>They are Lawful ones</HI>; by which

Lawful Things &mdash; <HI>Perimus Omnes.</HI> Where shall w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> find that the Devil ha's Laid our most fatal <HI>Snares</HI>?

The <HI>De|vil</HI> will decoye us, unto the utmost Edge of the <HI>Liberty</HI> that is <HI>Lawful</HI> for us; and then one Little push, hurries us into a Transgression against the Lord. And the <HI>Devil</HI> by Inviting us to a <HI>Lawful</HI> Thing, at a wrong Time for it, Layes us under further Entanglement of Guilt before God. Tis <HI>Lawful</HI> for people to use Recreations; but in the Evening of the Lord<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Day, or the Morning of any Day, how Enmaring are they! the <HI>Devil</HI> then too com|monly bears part in the Spo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t.

With such Thoughts does the Devil choose to persecute us; because thereby we come to <HI>Forfeit</HI> what we <HI>Question.</HI> We <HI>Question</HI> the Care of God, and so we <HI>Forfeit</HI> it, until perhaps the Devil do utterly <HI>Drown us in Perdition.</HI> Our God says, <HI>Trust in the Lord, and do good, and verily thou shalt be fed.</HI> But the Devil says, <HI>Don't you Trust in God; Be afraid that you shall not be fed</HI>; and thus he hinders men from the <HI>Doing of Good.</HI></P>
<P N="6">VI. There is nothing more Frequent in the <HI>Tempta|tions</HI> of the Devil, then for our <HI>Adoption</HI> to be doubt|ed, because of our <HI>Affliction.</HI> When our Lord was in his Penury, then says the Devil, <HI>If thou be the Son of God</HI>; he now makes an <HI>If,</HI> of it; <HI>What? the Son of God, and yet not be able to Command a Pit of Broad!</HI> Thus, when we are in very Afflictive Circumstances, this will be the Devils Inference, <HI>Thou art not a Child of God.</HI> The Bible says in Heb. 12.7. <HI>If you are Cha|stened, it is a shrow'd sign that you can't be Children.</HI> Since he can't Rob us of our <HI>Grace,</HI> he would Rob us of our <HI>Joy</HI>; and therefore having Accused us unto

God, he then Accuses God unto us. When <HI>Israel</HI> was weak and faint in the Wilderness, then did <HI>Amalek</HI> set up|on them; just so, does the Devil set upon the People of God, when their Losses, their Crosses, their Exercises have Enfeebled their Souls within them; and what says the <HI>De|vil</HI>? E'en the same that was mutter'd in the Ear of the Affli|cted <HI>Job, Is not this the &V;prightness of thy Ways? Remember, I pray thee, who ever perished, being Innocent? If thou wer'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> a Child of God, He would never follow thee, with such Testimo|nies of his Indignation.</HI> This is the <HI>Logic</HI> of the <HI>Devil</HI>; and he thus interrupts that patience, and that Chearfulness wherewith we should <HI>Suffer the Will of God.</HI></P>
<P N="7"><HI>VII.</HI> To Dispute the Divine Original and Authority of <HI>Gods Word,</HI> is not the least of those <HI>Temptations</HI> with which the Devil Troubles us. God from Heaven, had newly said unto our Lord, <HI>This is my Beloved Son</HI>; but now the Devil would have him to make a Dispute of it, <HI>If thou be the Son of God.</HI> The Devil durst not be so Impudent, and Brasen-faced, as to bid men use <HI>Pharaohs</HI> Language, <HI>Who is the Lord, that I should obey his voice</HI>? But he will whisper into our Ears, what he did unto our Mother <HI>Eve</HI> of old, <HI>It is not the Lord, that hath spoken, what you call his Word.</HI> The Devil would have men say unto the <HI>Scrip|ture,</HI> what they said unto the <HI>Prophet,</HI> in Jer. 43.2. <HI>Thou speakest falsely; the Lord our God hath not sent thee to speak what thou sayst unto us</HI>; and he would fain have secret and cursed Misgivings in our Hearts, <HI>That things are not altogether so as the Scripture has represented them.</HI> The Devil would wit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> all his Heart, make one huge Bonefire of all the Bibles in the World; and he has got millions of Persecutors to assist him in the Suppression of that Mira|culous Book. It was the Devil once in the Tongue of a Papist that cry'd out, <HI>A Plague on this Bible; this 'tis that
<PB N="19" REF="000657_0195_0FA9A2F52E84F368">
does all our mischief.</HI> But because he can't <HI>Suppress</HI> this Book, he sets himself, to <HI>Disgrace</HI> it all that he can. Al|tho' the Scripture carries its <HI>own Evidence</HI> with it, and be all over, so pure, so great, so true, and so powerful, that it is impossible it should proceed from any but God alone; yet the Devil would gladly bring some Discredit upon it, as if it were but some <HI>Humane Contrivance</HI>; Of nothing, is the Devil more desirous, than this; That we should not count, <HI>Christ</HI> so precious, <HI>Heaven</HI> so Glorious, <HI>Hell</HI> so Dreadful, and <HI>Sin</HI> so odious, as the Scripture has declared it.</P>
<P>&sect; The Second of our Lords Three Temptatons, is related after this manner, in Mat. 4.5, 6. <HI>Then the Devil taketh him up, into the Holy City, and setteth him upon a Pinacle of the Temple; and saith unto him, if thou be the Son of God, cast thy self down; For it is written, He shall give his Angels charge concerning thee, and in thy Hands, they shall bear thee up, lest at any time thou dash thy Foot against a Stone.</HI></P>
<P>From whence take these <HI>Remarks.</HI></P>
<P N="1"><HI>I.</HI> The places of the greatest <HI>Holiness</HI> will not secure us from Annoyance by the <HI>Temptations</HI> of the Devil, to the greatest wickedness. When our Lord was in the <HI>Holy Ci|ty,</HI> the Devil fell upon him there. Indeed, there is now no proper <HI>Holiness</HI> of <HI>Places</HI> in our Dayes; the Signs and Means of Gods more special Presence are not un|der the Gospel, ty'd unto any certain <HI>places:</HI> Never|theless there are <HI>places,</HI> where we use to enjoy much of God; and where, altho' God visit not the <HI>Persons</HI> for the sake of the <HI>Places,</HI> yet he visits th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>Places</HI> for the sake of the <HI>Persons.</HI> But, I am to tell you, that the Devil will visit those <HI>Places</HI> and the best <HI>Persons</HI> there.

No <HI>Place,</HI> that I know of, has got such a <HI>Spell</HI> upon it, as will always keep the Devil out. The <HI>Meeting-House</HI> wherein we Assemble for the Worship of God, is filled with many Holy People, and many Holy Concerns con|tinually; but if our Eyes were so refined as the Servant of the Prophet had his of old, I suppose we should now see a Throng of <HI>Devils</HI> in this very place. The Apostle has intimated, that <HI>Angels</HI> come in among us; there are <HI>Angels</HI> it seems, that hark, how I <HI>Preach,</HI> and how you <HI>Hear,</HI> at this Hour. And our own sad Experience is enough to intimate, That the <HI>Devils</HI> are likewise Rendevouzing here&punc; It is Reported, in <HI>Job</HI> 1.5. <HI>When the Sons of God, came to present themselves before the Lord, Satan came also among them.</HI> When we are in our Church-As|semblies, O how many <HI>Devils,</HI> do you imagine, croud in among us!

It is also possible, that we have our <HI>Closets,</HI> or our <HI>Studies,</HI> gloriously perfumed with Devotions every day; but alas, can we shut the Devil out of them? No, Let us go where we will, we shall still find a <HI>Devil</HI> nigh unto us. Onely, when we come to Heaven, we shall be out of his Reach for ever; <HI>O thou foul Devil; we are going where thou canst not come!</HI> He was hissed out of <HI>Paradise,</HI> and shall never enter it any more. Yea, more than so, when the <HI>New Jerusalem</HI> comes down into the <HI>High Places</HI> of our Air, from whence the Devil shall then be Banished, there shall be no <HI>Devil</HI> within the Walls of that <HI>Holy City.

<P N="3">III. <HI>High Stations</HI> in the Church of God, lay men open to violent and peculiar <HI>Temptations</HI> of the Devil. When Our Lord was upon the <HI>Pinacle,</HI> that is, not the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ane,</HI> or <HI>Spire,</HI> but the <HI>Battlements</HI> of the <HI>Temple,</HI> there did the Devil pest|er him, with singular Molestations, and he therein, seem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to intend an Entanglement for the Jews, as well as for Our Lord. Believe me, they that <HI>Stand High,</HI> cannot <HI>Stand safe</HI>&punc; The Devil is a <HI>Nimrod,</HI> a mighty Hunter; and common o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> little Game, will not serve his Turn: he is a <HI>Leviathan,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> whom we may say, as in Job. 41.34. <HI>He beholds all high Things.</HI> Men of <HI>High</HI> Attainments, and Men of <HI>High</HI> Em|ployments, in the Church of God, must look, like <HI>Peter</HI> to be more <HI>Sifted,</HI> and like <HI>Paul,</HI> to be more <HI>Buffeted</HI> than other Men. <HI>Feriunt Summos Fulmina Montes</HI>&punc; &mdash;The Devil can raise a Storm, when God permitteth it, but as for those Men that stand near Heaven, the Devil will attack them with his most cruel storms of Thunder and Lightning. It was said, <HI>Let him that stands take heed</HI>; but we may say, <HI>They that stand most high, have cause to take most Heed.</HI> The <HI>Devil</HI> is a <HI>Goliah</HI>; and when he finds a <HI>Champion,</HI> he'l be sure most fiercely to Combate such a man. He is for, <HI>Killing many Birds with one Stone</HI>; and he knows that he shall hinder a world of <HI>Good,</HI> and pro|duce a world of <HI>Ill,</HI> if once he can bring a man <HI>Eminently Stationed</HI> into his Toyls. Hence 'tis that the <HI>Ministers</HI> of God, are more dogg'd by the Devil, than other persons are. Especially such <HI>Ministers,</HI> as move in the highest Orb of Serviceableness; and most of all such <HI>Ministers</HI> as have spent many years in Laudable En|deavours to be Serviceable; Those Ministers are the

<HI>Stars</HI> of Heaven, at which the <HI>Tayl</HI> of the <HI>Dragon,</HI> will give the most sweeping and most stinging strokes; the Devil will find that for them, that shall make them <HI>Walk softly</HI> all their Dayes. These are the men, that have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">eepled, and vexed the <HI>Devil</HI> more than other men; for which the <HI>Devil</HI> has an old Quarrel with them.

We have to defend us, that Weapon in <HI>Eph.</HI> 6.16. <HI>The Sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God;</HI> but when the Devil has that very Weapon to fight us with, he makes terri|ble work of it. When the Devil would poyson men with false <HI>Doctrines,</HI> he'l quote Scriptures for them; a <HI>Quaker</HI> himself, will have the First Chapter of <HI>John</HI> always in his mouth.

<P N="5"><HI>V.</HI> Grievous and Pulling Hurries to <HI>Self-Murder</HI> are none of the smallest outrages, which the Devil in his <HI>Tempta|tions</HI> commits upon us. Why, did the Devil say to Our Lord, <HI>Cast thy self down,</HI> but in hopes that Our Lord would have broke his Bones, in the fall? The Devil is an <HI>Old Murtherer</HI>; and he loves to <HI>Murder</HI> men, but no <HI>Murder</HI> gives him so much satisfaction, as that which at his Instiga|tion, Men perpetrate upon themselves. We see that such as are <HI>Bewitched</HI> and <HI>Possessed</HI> by the devil, do quickly lay violent hands upon themselves, if they be not watched con|tinually, and we see that w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">en persons have begun that <HI>&V;n|natural</HI> business of <HI>killing themselves,</HI> there is a <HI>Preternatural</HI> Stupendous Prodigious Assistence, by the devil given there|unto. When people are going to Harm themselves, we call upon them, like those to the Jailor, in Acts. 16.28 <HI>Do thy self no harm!</HI> And we have this Argument for it, <HI>It is the Devil that is dragging of you to this mischief; but will you believe, will you obey such an one as the
<PB N="25" REF="000657_0201_0FA9A21C6FBA9CD8">
Devil is</HI>? What was it that made <HI>Judas</HI> to Strangle himself? We read it was when the <HI>Devil was in him.</HI> I suppose there are few <HI>Self-Murderers,</HI> but what are first very strangely fallen into the Devils hands; and possibly, 'tis by some Extraordinary <HI>Discontent,</HI> against God, or <HI>Backsliding</HI> from Him, that the Devil first en|tred into those disturbed Souls. Indeed, some very great Saints of God, have sometimes had hideous Royls rai|sed by the Devil in their minds; until they have e'en cry'd out with <HI>Jo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, I choose Strangling rather than life</HI>; and sometimes the Ill Humours or Vapours in the Bo|dies of such Good Men, do so harbour the Devil that they have this woful motion every day thence made unto them; <HI>You must kill your self! you must! you must!</HI> But it is rarely any other than a <HI>Saul,</HI> an <HI>Abimelek,</HI> an <HI>A|chitophel,</HI> or a <HI>Judas</HI>; rarely any other, than a very Reprobate, whom the Devil can drive, while the man is, <HI>Compos Mentis,</HI> to Consummate such a Villany.

A <HI>Self-Murder,</HI> acted by one that is upon other accounts, a Reasona|ble Man, is but such an Attempt of <HI>Revenge</HI> upon the God that made him, as none but one full of the De|vil can be guilty of.

<P N="6"><HI>VI.</HI> Presumptuous and Unwarrantable <HI>Trials</HI> of the Blessed God, are some of those things whereinto the Devil would fain hook us with his <HI>Temptations.</HI> This
<PB N="26" REF="000657_0202_0FA9A21D309A4E78">
was that which the Devil would have brought our Lord unto, even, <HI>A Tempting of the Lord our God.</HI> It is the charge of our God upon us, in <HI>Deut.</HI> 6.16. <HI>Thou shalt not Tempt the Lord thy God.</HI> But that which the Devil <HI>Tries,</HI> is, to put us upon <HI>Trying</HI> in a sinful way, whether God be such a God as indeed He is. 'Tis true, as to the Ways of <HI>O|bedience,</HI> our God says unto us, <HI>Prove me, in th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">se wayes; Try, Whether I won't be as Good as my Word.</HI> But then, there are ways of <HI>Presumption,</HI> wherein the Devil would have us to <HI>Try,</HI> what a God it is, <HI>With whom we have to do.</HI> The Devil would have us to <HI>Try</HI> the <HI>Purpose</HI> of God, about our selves or others; but how? By going to the <HI>Devil</HI> himself; by Consulting <HI>Astrologers,</HI> or <HI>Fortune-tellers,</HI> or perhaps, by letting the Bible fall open, to see what is the first Sentence we light upon. The Devil would have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>Try</HI> the <HI>Mercy</HI> of God; But how? By <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">unning into <HI>Dan|gers,</HI> which we have no call unto. He would have us <HI>Try</HI> the <HI>Power</HI> of God; But how?

He would have us <HI>Try</HI> the <HI>Justi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e</HI> of God; but how? By venturing upon Sin, in a <HI>Corner,</HI> with an Imagination that God will never bring us out. He would have us <HI>Try</HI> the <HI>Promise</HI> of God; but how? By <HI>Limiting</HI> the Lord, unto such or such a way of Manifesting Himself, or else believ|ing of nothing at all. He would have us <HI>Try</HI> the <HI>Threat|ning</HI> of God; but how? By going on Impenitently in those things, for which the <HI>Wrath of God comes upon the Children of Disobedience.</HI> Thus would the Devil have us, to affront the Majesty of Heaven every day.</P>
<P N="7">VII. The <HI>Temptations</HI> of the Devil&punc; aim at puffing and Bloating of us up, with <HI>Pride</HI>; as much perhaps as any one iniquity. The Devil would have had Our Lord make a <HI>Vain-glorious</HI> Discovery of hims<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lf unto the world, by <HI>Flying in the air,</HI> so as no mortal can. <HI>Hoe I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">na<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">us <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> the Devil would have us to fear aloft, and not only to <HI>be</HI> above other

men, but also to <HI>know</HI> that we are so. <HI>Pride</HI> is the Devils own sin; and he affects especially to be, <HI>The King over the Chil|dren of Pride,</HI> It is a caution, in 1. Tim. 3.6. A Pastor must not be <HI>A Novice; Lest being lifted up with Pride, He fall into the condemnation of the Devil. [Summo ac Pio cum Tremore Hunc Textum Legamus nos Ministri Juven<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s!]</HI> Ac|cordingly, the Devil would have us to be inordinately taken and moved with what <HI>Excellencies</HI> our God ha's bestowed upon us. If our <HI>Estates</HI> rise, he would have us rise in our Spirits too. If we have ben blessed with beauty, with breed|ing, with Honour, with Success, with Attire, with spiritual Priviledges, or with Praise-worthy Performances; Now saies the Devil, <HI>Think thy self better than other Men.</HI> Yea, the Devil, would have us arrogate unto ourselves, those <HI>Ex|cellencies,</HI> which really we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> were owners of; and, <HI>Boast of a false g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">st.</HI> He would have us moreover to Thirst after Applause among others that may see Our <HI>Excellen|cies</HI>; and be impatient if we are not accounted <HI>some-body.</HI> He would have us furthermore, to aspire after such a <HI>Fi|gure,</HI> as God ha's never yet seen fitting for us; &amp; croud into some <HI>High Chair</HI> that becomes us not. Thus would the Devil Elevate us into the <HI>Air,</HI> above our Neighbours; and why so! Tis that we may be punis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">d with such <HI>Falls,</HI> as may make us cry out with <HI>David, O my Bones are broken with my Falls</HI>! The Devil can't endure to see men lying in the <HI>Dust</HI>; because there is no falling thence. He is a <HI>Fallen Spirit</HI> himself, and it pleases him to see the <HI>Falls</HI> of men.</P>
<P>&sect; The Third of Our Lords Three Temptations, is re|lated in such Terms as these. Math. 4.8, 9. <HI>Again the Divel taketh him up, into an exc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ding High Mountain, and sheweth him all the Kingdomes of the world, and the glory of them: and saith unto him, all these things will I give thee, if Thou wilt fall down and Worship me.</HI> From whence take these Remarks&punc;</P>
<P N="1">I. The Devil in his <HI>Temptations</HI> will set the Delights of
<PB N="28" REF="000657_0204_0FA9A21EAFA46D28">
this world before us; but he'l set a fair, and a false <HI>Varnish</HI> upon those Delights. They were some unknown <HI>Perspe|ct<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ves,</HI> which the Devil had, both for the Refracting of the <HI>Medium,</HI> and for the Magnifying of the <HI>Object,</HI> whereby he gave our Lord at once a prospect of the whole Roman Empire; but what was it? It was the <HI>World,</HI> and the <HI>Glo|ry</HI> of it; he says not a word of the <HI>World,</HI> and the <HI>Trouble</HI> of it. No sure; not a word of that; the Devil will not have his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> so barely expos'd unto us. The Devil sets off the Delights of Sin, which he offers unto us, with a stretch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed and a raised Rhetoric; but he will not own, <HI>That in the midst of our Laughter, our Heart shall be sorrowful</HI>; and, <HI>That the end of our Mirth shall be Hea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">iness.</HI> There is but one Glass in the Spectacles, with which the Devil would have us to read, those passages in <HI>Eccl.</HI> 11.9. <HI>Rejoyce, O young man in thy youth, and let thy Heart chear thee in the Daye of thy youth and walk in the ways of thy Heart, and in the sight of thine Eyes.</HI> Thus far the Devil would have us to Read, and he'l make many a fine Comment upon it; he'l tell us, That if we<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l follow the Courses of the World, we shall swim in all the Delights of the World. But he is not willing you should Read out the next words; <HI>But know thou, that for all these things G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d shall bring thee into Judg|ment.</HI> O he's loth we should be aware of the dreadful Is|sues, and Reckonings that our Worldly Delights will be attended with. He sets before us, <HI>The Pleasures of Sin</HI>; but he will not say, <HI>T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">se are but for a Season.</HI> He sets be|fore us, <HI>The sweet Waters of Stealth</HI>; but he will not say, <HI>There is Dea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">.</HI> He is a <HI>Mountebank,</HI> that will bestow nothing but Romantic Praises upon all that he makes us the Offers of.</P>
<P N="2">II. There are most Hellish <HI>Blasphemies</HI> often buzz'd by the <HI>Temptation<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> of the Devil, into the minds of the best men alive. What a most Execrable Thing was here laid before our Lord Himself: Even, To own the <HI>Devil</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="29" REF="000657_0205_0FA9A21F6F478400">
<HI>God</HI>! a thing that cannot be uttered, without unutterable Horror of Soul. The best man on earth, may have such <HI>Fiery Darts</HI> from Hell shot into his mind. One that was acted by the <HI>Devil,</HI> had the impudence to propound this, unto such a good <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">, <HI>Curse God.</HI> And the Devil pleases himself, by ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">sing the Hearts of good men, with his base Injections, <HI>That there is no God,</HI> or, <HI>That God is not a Righteous God</HI>; and a thousand more such things, too De|villish to be mentioned A good man is extreamly griev'd at it, when he hears a <HI>Blasphemy</HI> from the mouth of ano|ther man; said the Psalmist, in Psal. 4<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.15, 16. <HI>My Con|fusion is continually before me, for the voice of him that Blas|phemeth.</HI> But much mor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, when a good man finds a <HI>Blas|phemy</HI> in his own Heart; O it throws him into most Fe|vourish Agonies of Soul. For this cause, a mischievous Devil, will <HI>Fly-blow</HI> the Heart of such a man, with such Blasphemous Thoughts, as make him cry out, <HI>Lord, I am e'n weary of my life.</HI> Yea, the Devil serves the man just as the Mistress of <HI>Joseph</HI> dealt with him; he importunes the man to <HI>Think wickedly</HI> from Day to Day; and if the man refuse, he cries out at last, <HI>Behold, what wicked Thoughts this man has lodging in him.</HI> Sayst thou so? <HI>Sa|tan!</HI> No, they are Brats of thy own; and at thy Door a|lone shall they be laid for ever.</P>
<P N="3"><HI>III.</HI> There is a sort of <HI>Witchcraft</HI> in those things, where|to the <HI>Temptations</HI> of the Devil would Inveigle us. To worship the Devil is <HI>Witchcraft,</HI> and under that notion was Our Lord urged unto sin. We are told in, 1. Sam. 15.23. <HI>Rebellion is as the sin of Witchcraft:</HI> When the Devil would have us to sin, he would have us to do the things which the forlorn Witches use to do. Perhaps there are few persons, ever allured by the Devil unto an Explicit Covenant with himself. If any among ourselves be so, my counsil is, that you hunt the Devil from you, with such words as the Psalmist had, <HI>Be gone: Depart from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, ye evil Doers, for I will keep the Commandments of
<PB N="30" REF="000657_0206_0FA9A220EAC98978">
my God.</HI> But alas, the most of men, are by the Devil, put upon doing the Things that are Analagous to the worst usages of Witches. The Devil saies to the sinner, <HI>Despise thy Baptism, and all the Bond of it, and all the Good of it.</HI> The Devil saies to the sinner, <HI>Come, cast off the Authority of God, and refuse the Salvation of Christ, for ever.</HI> Yea the De|vil who is called, <HI>The God of this World,</HI> would have us to take <HI>Him</HI> for Our <HI>God</HI>; and rather hear <HI>Him,</HI> Trust <HI>Him,</HI> Serve <HI>Him,</HI> than the <HI>God</HI> that formed us.</P>
<P N="4"><HI>IV.</HI> The <HI>Temptations</HI> of the Devil do Tug and Pull for nothing more, than that the <HI>Rulers</HI> of the World may yield Homage unto him. Our Lord has had this by His Father Engag'd unto him, <HI>That He shall one day be Governour of the Nations</HI> The Devil do's extreamly dread the Approach of that Illustrious time when, <HI>The Kingdome of God shall come and His Will be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">one, as in Heaven, and on Earth.</HI> For this cause it was that he was desirous, Our Lord should rather have Accepted of <HI>him,</HI> that Kingdom, which <HI>Antichrist</HI> afterwards accepted of him, for the Establishment of <HI>Devil-worship,</HI> in the World. I may tell you, The Devil is mighty unwilling, that there should be one <HI>Godly Magistrate</HI> upon the face of the Earth. Such is the influence of <HI>Government,</HI> that the Devil will every where stickle migh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ily, to have <HI>That</HI> siding with him. What <HI>R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ers</HI> would the Devil have, to command all mankind, if he might have his will? Even, such as are called, in Psal. 94.20. <HI>The Thr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e of Iniquity, which frames mischief by a Law</HI>; such as will promote <HI>Vice,</HI> by both Connivance, and Example; and such as will Oppress all that shall be <HI>Holy, and Just and Good.</HI> All men have cause therefore, to be jealous, what Use the Devil may make of them, with reference to the Af|fairs of <HI>Government</HI>; but <HI>Rulers</HI> may most of all think, that the Lord Jesus from Heaven calls upon them, <HI>Sa|tan

has desired that he might Sift you, and have you; O Look to it, what side <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Take.</HI></P>
<P>Thus have you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> Temptations of our Lord, seen the principal of those <HI>Devices,</HI> which the Devil has to Entrap our Souls. But what shall we now do, that we may be fortify'd against those <HI>Devices</HI>? O that we might be well furnished with the <HI>whole Armour of God</HI>! But, methinks, there were some things attending the Temptations of our Lord, which would especially Recommend those few Hints unto us for our Guard.</P>
<P>First, If you are not fond of <HI>Temptation,</HI> be not fond of Needless, or Too much <HI>Retirement.</HI> Where was it, that the Devil fell upon our Lord? it was when he was <HI>Alone</HI> in the Wilderness. We should all have our Times to be <HI>A|lone</HI> every Day; and if the <HI>Devil</HI> go to scare us out of our Chambers, with such a Bugbear, as <HI>That hee'll appear to us,</HI> yet stay in spite of his teeth, stay to finish your Devotions; he <HI>Lyes,</HI> he dare not show his head. But on the other-side by being too solitary, we may lay ourselves too much o|pen to the Devil; You know who saies, <HI>Wo to him that is alone.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, Let an <HI>Oracle</HI> of God be your defence against a <HI>Temptation</HI> of Hell. How did our Lord Silence the Devil? It was with an, <HI>It is Written!</HI> And all his Three Citations were from that one Book of <HI>Deuteronomy.</HI> What a full armoury then have we, in all the sacred Pages that ly be|fore us&punc; Whatever the Words of the <HI>Devil</HI> are, drown them with the words of the <HI>Great God.</HI> Say, <HI>It is Written.</HI> The <HI>Belshazzar</HI> of Hell will Tremble and Withdraw, if you show these <HI>Hand-writings</HI> of the Lord.</P>
<P>Lastly, Si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ee the Lord Jesus Christ, has Conquered
<PB N="32" REF="000657_0208_0FA9A221B10E5598">
all the <HI>Temptations</HI> of the Devil, Fly to that Lord, Cry to that Lord, that He would give <HI>you</HI> a share in his Happy Victory. It was for <HI>&V;s</HI> that our Lord overcame the Devil: and when he did but say, <HI>Satan, Get hence,</HI> away presently the Tygre flew. Does the Devil Molest <HI>&V;s?</HI> Then Let us Repair to our Lord, who says, <HI>I know how to Succour the Tempted.</HI> Said the Psalmist, in Psal. 61.2. <HI>Lead me to the Rock that is higher than I.</HI> A Woman in this Land being un|der the Possession of Devils, the Devils within her, audibly spoke of divers Harms they would inflict upon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">; but still they made this answer, <HI>Ah! She Runs to the Rock! She Runs to the Rock</HI>! and that hin|dred all. O this <HI>Running to the Rock</HI> 'tis the best Preservation in the World; the <HI>Vultures</HI> of Hell can not prey upon the <HI>Doves</HI> in the Clefts of that <HI>Rock</HI> May our God now Lead us thereunto.</P>
