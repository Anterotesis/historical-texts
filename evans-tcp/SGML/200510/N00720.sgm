And fora&s;much as Builders and Workmen imployed under them, are oft times remi&s;s and negligent of their Duty in that regard, as has been found by experience; and it being therefore nece&s;&s;ary and agreeable to the cour&s;e and pra|ctice of His Maje&s;ties Kingdom of</HI> England; <HI>That &s;uitable provi&s;ion be made, and effectual care taken therein.</HI></P>
