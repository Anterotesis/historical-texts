<L>WHAT Sounds are the&s;e of gen'ral Joy,</L>
<L>That on my Ear-Drums beat?</L>
<L>Each Face proclaims a merry Heart,</L>
<L>And Frolicks fill the Street.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="2">
<HEAD>2.</HEAD>
<L>The Troops are come, Huzza! Huzza's</L>
<L>Is eccho'd thro' the Croud;</L>
<L>Guns from the Ca&s;tle fla&s;h and roar,</L>
<L>The Bells all ring aloud.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="3">
<HEAD>3.</HEAD>
<L>Then to the lofty '&s;piring Top,</L>
<L>of Beacon-Hill we went;</L>
<L>Thence took a View of Ships and Town,</L>
<L>a Show magnificent!</L>
</LG>
<LG N="4">
<HEAD>4.</HEAD>
<L>Some with Laughing &s;plit their Sides,</L>
<L>others with Singing roar;</L>
<L>While &s;ome 'tis fear'd in Taverns drink</L>
<L>'Till they can drink no more.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="5">
<HEAD>5.</HEAD>
<L>'Tis hop'd none &s;tagger round the Street,</L>
<L>Nor dance nor caper high;</L>
<L>In Frolicks drink whole Bottles up,</L>
<L>Then to&s;s them to the Sky.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="6">
<HEAD>6.</HEAD>
<L>And thus with jolly Mirth they &s;pend,</L>
<L>The twice, thrice welcome Day;</L>
<L>The Night in Town-Hou&s;e-Street &s;ome &s;tand,</L>
<L>To &s;ee the Fire-works play.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="7">
<HEAD>7.</HEAD>
<L>The next Day, was a Day of Joy,</L>
<L>It was a Thank&s;giving:</L>
<L>The Forces land, and add new Cau&s;e,</L>
<L>For us aloud to Sing.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="8">
<HEAD>8.</HEAD>
<L>The Tents around, mo&s;t beautiful,</L>
<L>Form a delight&s;ome Scene:</L>
<L>And thus they lye, all free from Care,</L>
<L>Quite placid and &s;erene.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="9">
<HEAD>9.</HEAD>
<L>The next Day, Sports of various Kind,</L>
<L>and Bu&s;ine&s;s fill'd their Hand:</L>
<L>And while on the Green Gra&s;s they lay,</L>
<L>Them <HI>Zephyrs</HI> gently fan'd,</L>
</LG>
<LG N="10">
<HEAD>10.</HEAD>
<L>Some viewing were a Monkey Play,</L>
<L>and others a Baboon;</L>
<L>Such antic Po&s;tures pleas'd them &s;o,</L>
<L>They mi&s;s'd to dine at Noon.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="11">
<HEAD>11.</HEAD>
<L>Here &s;ome that left their Sweet-Hearts dear,</L>
<L>In doleful Dumps cry'd, "Oh!</L>
<L>"Pray little Cupid how could you,</L>
<L>"Pierce my poor, fond Heart &s;o!"</L>
</LG>
<LG N="12">
<HEAD>12.</HEAD>
<L>The Women mind their proper Work,</L>
<L>Tho' there were none a Spinning:</L>
<L>Yet they were looking up their Meat,</L>
<L>Or wa&s;hing out their Linning.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="13">
<HEAD>13.</HEAD>
<L>No Brauls or Fighting was there &s;een,</L>
<L>None wi&s;h'd his Brother ill:</L>
<L>Their Swords were made the <HI>French</HI> to cut,</L>
<L>And not each other Kill.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="14">
<HEAD>14.</HEAD>
<L>Some li&s;tning were to Mu&s;ick's Charm,</L>
<L>Which &s;oftly mov'd along:</L>
<L>It breath'd in&s;piring o'er the Plain,</L>
<L>And pleas'd th' attentive Throng.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="15">
<HEAD>15.</HEAD>
<L>But now, the Day, the Day is come,</L>
<L>That They mu&s;t take their March:</L>
<L>The Sun glows bright, and pours its Beams,</L>
<L>Thro' all the Heav'ns wide Arch.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="16">
<HEAD>16.</HEAD>
<L>Bu&s;y as Bees, down go their Tents,</L>
<L>The Carts receive their Store:</L>
<L>To leave the Town them&s;elves prepare,</L>
<L>To Victory to &s;oar.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="17">
<HEAD>17.</HEAD>
<L>Nor loitering in their Work are they;</L>
<L>But at the Hour of Six.</L>
<L>They all are ready for their March,</L>
<L>Not one Thing need they Fix.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="18">
<HEAD>18.</HEAD>
<L>The Drum now beats, "<HI>Prepare to Arms!</HI></L>
<L>They joyful at the Sound;</L>
<L>"<HI>We go to Victory,</HI>" (they cry)</L>
<L>"<HI>And make our Name renown'd.</HI>"</L>

<L>(They to each other &s;ay;)</L>
<L>Encouraging them&s;elves in this,</L>
<L>They chearful go away.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="20">
<HEAD>20.</HEAD>
<L>The Streets all full to view the Sight,</L>
<L>Each Window crouded is;</L>
<L>While They maje&s;tic onward march,</L>
<L>Their Hearts are big with Bli&s;s.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="21">
<HEAD>21.</HEAD>
<L>See, all the Guns, they gli&s;ten bright,</L>
<L>At Di&s;tance &s;eem to blaze;</L>
<L>While the &s;oft Mu&s;ick's gentle Sound,</L>
<L>In charming Concert plays.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="22">
<HEAD>22.</HEAD>
<L>Behold them while they march along,</L>
<L>In dazzling Armour dre&s;t;</L>
<L>True Courage &s;hines in every Face,</L>
<L>Undaunted is each Brea&s;t.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="23">
<HEAD>23.</HEAD>
<L>But now they're gone; O may Succe&s;s,</L>
<L>On all their Ways attend!</L>
<L>May their bright Arms victorious prove,</L>
<L>And Conque&s;ts crown their End!</L>

<L>Relate, how FRONTENAC we took,</L>
<L>Down fell the high thick Walls;</L>
<L>Th' Inhabitants all wild with Fear,</L>
<L>Are &s;catter'd by our Balls.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="26">
<HEAD>26.</HEAD>
<L>The Women out with Tongs did run,</L>
<L>The Cookmaids with their Spits;</L>
<L>Then from our Guns a Bullet flies</L>
<L>Which &s;cares them into Fits.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="27">
<HEAD>27.</HEAD>
<L>The Men are frightn'd and di&s;may'd,</L>
<L>Some down the Cellars fled;</L>
<L>And there, for fear they &s;hould be &s;calpt,</L>
<L>Do feign them&s;elves as dead.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="28">
<HEAD>28.</HEAD>
<L>Some leave their Cannon, Fort and all,</L>

<L>While others roar and cry aloud,</L>
<L>"<HI>What will become of We!</HI>"</L>
</LG>
<LG N="29">
<HEAD>29.</HEAD>
<L>Such di&s;mal Terrors were they in,</L>
<L>When march'd our gallant Men;</L>
<L>They took their Fort and Plunder too,</L>
<L>And nothing let remain.</L>
