<P>MY reverend brethren, who have gone before me on this occa&s;ion, having refre&s;hed your me|mory with &s;everal hi&s;toric facts, relative to the removal of our fore-fathers, through great impe|diment,
<PB N="6" REF="014118_0005_0F92FFB5A956A440">
and hazard, by means of the mercile&s;s rage, and cruelty of their per&s;ecutors, from England, to Holland; their fir&s;t &s;ettlement at Am|&s;terdam; afterwards at Leyden, and their return to England, with re&s;olutions, by the will of God, to pur&s;ue their voyage, with all convenient &s;peed, over the Atlantic, to the uncultivated re|gions of America; and their landing on the&s;e di&s;tant and then &s;avage &s;hores, in a cold and inclement &s;ea&s;on; actuated by the &s;ame princi|ples, that at fir&s;t induced them to abandon their fair inheritance in their own country, and &s;eek an a&s;ylum from the illiberal per&s;ecuting &s;pirit of their fellow citizens, in the more peaceful climes of a neighbouring &s;tate.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not therefore ri&s;que the cen&s;ure of this grave and intelligent audience, if I excu&s;e my &s;elf from the repetition of &s;uch intere&s;ting particu|lars, and invite their attention to that part of the in&s;pired word propo&s;ed for our pre&s;ent con&s;ide|ration; which, however, I tru&s;t, will lead us to employ our minds in &s;entiments not altogether foreign from the intention of this anniver&s;ary.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t pa&s;&s;age, in accommodation to human conception and practice, repre&s;ents the &s;upreme Being, as reviewing his works, after they were fini&s;hed; and being &s;atisfied when he &s;aw his plan compleated; and that every thing He had made, every cla&s;s and order of beings, and each indi|vidual, in regard to the diver&s;ity of their rank, power, propen&s;ity and pur&s;uits, perfectly corre&s;|ponded to the original model formed in his own mind. <HI>God &s;aw every thing that He had made, and behold it was very good,</HI> framed according to his purpo&s;e, and endued with every capacity, and quality, to an&s;wer the end of it's creation.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="014118_0006_0F92FFB6760335A0">Among the works of God, man holds a place of di&s;tingu&s;hed rank, and dignity; being made in the divine Image, and inve&s;ted with dominion and &s;uperiority over the re&s;t of the creatures.
<Q>The change of phra&s;e, and the manner of ex|pre&s;&s;ion u&s;ed, at the formation of man, it has been ob&s;erved, denotes that he is the chief, and mo&s;t perfect of the works of God, in this lower world.</Q></P>
<P>It is be&s;ide our de&s;ign to enquire particularly, what is intended by the Image of God, in which man was at fir&s;t created; about which divines have held &s;ome different opinions: But as it can|not imply le&s;s than pre-eminence of nature, and va&s;tly &s;uperior endowments both of body and mind, as well as dominion, above any of tho&s;e works which God pronounced very good; we &s;hall di&s;mi&s;s the con&s;ideration of other natures, and confine our attention to his.</P>
<P>As God de&s;igned &s;uch a creature as man &s;hould exi&s;t at the head, and as Lord of this world; ha|ving prepared the way, and provided for his re|gular exerci&s;e and entertainment, by the previ|ous formation of the earth, and the great varie|ty of things both of the animal and vegetable kind that repleni&s;h and adorn it; his almighty fiat &s;pake him into being.</P>
<P>In his exalted &s;tation, he was happy in the fa|vour and approbation of his Creator, the &s;uperior principle of rea&s;on, and moral &s;en&s;e with which he was endowed, rendered him capable of di&s;|charging the duties of it; and behaving with that propriety, and dignity, as &s;hould redound to the divine glory, and his own progre&s;s, and advantage.</P>
<P>He had a capacity to improve in natural and moral &s;cience, and perfection; his appetites and
<PB N="8" REF="014118_0007_0F92FFB71C800158">
pa&s;&s;ions were controulable by the &s;uperior prin|ciples of his nature, and his propen&s;ities carried him into acts of love, gratitude and obedience towards God. By ob&s;erving the law of his na|ture, and tho&s;e po&s;itive precepts which perfect wi&s;dom &s;aw fit to &s;ubjoin, he was able to make high advances in moral rectitude and happine&s;s, and continue in the &s;miles and benediction of his maker.</P>
<P>He was a moral agent, endowed as it is com|monly expre&s;&s;ed, with freedom of will, or a &s;elf-determining power, in regard to &s;uch volitions and actions as form the moral character, and be|get a likene&s;s to the divine purity, or the contra|ry.</P>
<P>Liberty was an e&s;&s;ential principle of his con&s;ti|tution, a natural quality, and a nece&s;&s;ary &s;pring, and incentive to all virtuous improvement.</P>
<P>His right to u&s;e the things provided for the &s;upply of his nece&s;&s;ities, or convenience, was de|rived from the divine grant, either explicitly made, or di&s;covered by the light of his own un|der&s;tanding; &s;ubject to no re&s;traint, but the law of his nature, which was not only con&s;i&s;tent with, but the perfection of Liberty; obligation to obey the laws of the Creator, being only a check to licentiou&s;ne&s;s, and <HI>abu&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>He could not rea&s;onably de&s;ire any change in his &s;tate, or any of his circum&s;tances, but what his progre&s;s in holine&s;s, and in the &s;everal pious, and &s;ocial affections, would to the advantage of his felicity, nece&s;&s;arily produce.</P>
<P>Had he per&s;evered in his natural rectitude, and attachment to God, and obedience to his laws, of which he was made capable; and po&s;terity de&s;|cended from him in his own likene&s;s; angry con|tentions,
<PB N="9" REF="014118_0008_0F92FFBAB2EF6208">
oppre&s;&s;ion, and cruelty which now take place, and are the &s;ources of &s;o much havock and mi&s;ery to the human race, would not have been known in the world.</P>
<P>Government of &s;ome &s;ort, adapted to the hu|man nature and circum&s;tances, would indeed, probably, have been in&s;tituted among them, as from many pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture we have rea&s;on to think it is among the Angels them&s;elves; but there would have been no &s;uch laws as are made for the lawle&s;s and di&s;obedient, for the un|godly and for &s;inners.</P>
<P>It is perhaps, nece&s;&s;ary to the order and hap|pine&s;s of all created intelligences, who&s;e under|&s;tanding mu&s;t be limited, to have government among them; though we need not enquire, whe|ther in regard to created &s;pirits, who have no bo|dily wants to &s;upply, it ought to be di&s;tinct from, or more po&s;itive, than the original laws of their nature?</P>
<P>To &s;uch beings, however, it &s;eems nece&s;&s;ary it &s;hould, who require bodily &s;upport and conve|nience, and who from their &s;ituation, and condi|tion are capable of acquiring di&s;tinct and private property. This would have been the ca&s;e with man, had he continued innocent, and become numerous, as it now is in his fallen and depraved &s;tate.</P>
<P>Di&s;putes might and probably would &s;ome|times ari&s;e, in regard to per&s;onal rights and pro|perty; not, indeed, as now from the depravity of our affections, but meerly from the imperfec|tion of knowledge; which mu&s;t be &s;ettled by &s;ome known rules, or laws e&s;tabli&s;hed by the con|&s;ent of the whole: otherwi&s;e property would in
<PB N="10" REF="014118_0009_0F92FFBCE30DA9D0">
&s;ome in&s;tances, remain precarious, and undeter|mined.</P>
<P>As there would however, be no evil inclina|tion, or de&s;ign in any individual, or &s;u&s;picion of it in others, to invade the property, retain the rights, or check the liberty of any; and as the&s;e di&s;putes would take place in con&s;equence only of tho&s;e errors of the memory, mi&s;apprehen&s;ion and mi&s;take to which the human mind, from its natural imbecility, tho' innocent, mu&s;t be liable; they would always be i&s;&s;ued in the mo&s;t amicable manner, and to the entire &s;atisfaction of the parties; and every one left to the free exerci&s;e of the gifts of nature, and the unmole&s;|ted enjoyment of the bounties of providence.</P>
<P>Making daily progre&s;s in natural and moral perfection, dignity and happine&s;s; of which in this &s;tate of things, mankind could not fail, they would proportionably fulfil, and always be fulfilling the wi&s;e and good end of their Creation.</P>
<P>With great propriety, therefore, might God on the review of the make of man, finding how admirably he was qualified to an&s;wer &s;uch a purpo&s;e, and to live in perpetual freedom and happine&s;s, be repre&s;ented &s;aying, as in our text, <HI>Behold it is very good.</HI></P>
<P>Such was the primitive &s;tate of man&mdash;happy in the divine image and favor, and in the puri|ty and freedom of his own faculties.</P>
<P>But alas! how changed! what a rever&s;e of things did he undergo at the fall! when he vi|olated the law of his maker, given for the tryal of his fidelity and obedience, and commenced rebel again&s;t God, what <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> did he make of the divine pre&s;ence, and favour! what a &s;in|ful
<PB N="11" REF="014118_0010_0F92FFBD26E10890">
nature! What irregular propen&s;ities! What &s;trong untoward and eccentric appetites and pa&s;&s;ions were introduced into his con&s;titution! and how by one man's di&s;obedience were many made &s;inners, and brought under the condemnati|on of the righteous law of God!</P>
<P>Mankind, however, though fallen into a di&s;or|dered, and perverted &s;tate, were not &s;uffered to peri&s;h in con&s;equence of the one tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion; but the fore-ordained grace of God counteracted the effects of it, by bringing forward a new, and happy di&s;pen&s;ation, founded on the obedience and righteou&s;ne&s;s of Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>What marvellous de&s;igns of wi&s;dom, and love had God our heavenly Father, in view, for a lo&s;t world! and how ought our hearts to be comforted, being knit together in love, and un|to all riches of the full a&s;&s;urance of under&s;tan|ding, to the acknowledgement of the my&s;tery of God, and of the Father and of Chri&s;t!</P>
<P>The rational faculties of the human mind, though &s;adly darkened, and indi&s;po&s;ed to mo|ral and religious performances, were not de&s;|troyed; the pa&s;&s;ions, though depraved, were not eradicated: In every idea of the &s;oul, but its primitive purity and rectitude, there remained the e&s;&s;ential properties of humanity; particular|ly the love of Liberty; which is an original pa&s;&s;ion, not meerly innocent, but requi&s;ite both before and &s;ince the fall, to all virtuous exerti|ons, and happy enjoyments, though now ex|tremely liable to abu&s;e by our&s;elves, and re&s;traint from our fellowmen.</P>
<P>In whatever view the principle of Liberty be con&s;idered, or by whatever name di&s;tingui&s;hed,
<PB N="12" REF="014118_0011_0F92FFBE709410D0">
whether by natural or moral, Civil or religious Liberty; it has its ri&s;e from nature; and it ap|pears to be the will of God that mankind &s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;s it, in each of the&s;e &s;en&s;es.</P>
<P>Civil liberty is indeed, immediately derived from human compact, and founded on civil go|vernment; but it more properly, though remote|ly, proceeds from nature, as it is the voice of rea|&s;on that men, for the greater &s;ecurity of their per&s;ons and property, and the promotion of their happine&s;s, &s;hould form into &s;ociety, and e&s;tabli&s;h government among them.</P>
<P>Con&s;idering men as being already &s;o formed, I &s;hall hereafter &s;peak of liberty chiefly as it relates to their civil and religious affairs; though it will be difficult to di&s;cour&s;e without &s;ometimes blen|ding the other &s;en&s;es with it; which I &s;hall not be very eareful to avoid.</P>
<P>The beneficial improvement both of our civil and religious rights depends on liberty.</P>
<P>Matters that pertain to con&s;cience, and the wor&s;hip and &s;ervice of God, and the preparati|on of our Souls for another world, are the ob|jects of religious liberty; and tho&s;e things that relate to our pre&s;ent &s;ecurity and happine&s;s in civil government, are the objects of civil liberty.</P>
<P>In this manner civil and religious liberty, are u&s;ually di&s;tingui&s;hed; but as there is a connecti|on between tho&s;e ble&s;&s;ings which tend to our pre&s;ent happine&s;s, in civil government, and tho&s;e, which are nece&s;&s;ary to lay the foundation of that which is future and eternal, and as con&s;cience is really concerned in both; and men can no more, without offending God, and violating the laws of &s;ociety, re&s;ign, or neglect the former, than
<PB N="13" REF="014118_0012_0F92FFBEC6CDC688">
the latter; the&s;e two &s;en&s;es of liberty &s;eem &s;o far to intermix, and in a &s;ort become one.</P>
<P>The human mind is &s;o framed by its wi&s;e au|thor, as to be greatly &s;u&s;ceptive of di&s;advanta|geous impre&s;&s;ions in regard to its moral &s;tate and acts of wor&s;hip, from the re&s;traints of our civil li|berty, which mu&s;t be allowed to be an undeni|able argument that &s;uch re&s;traints are contrary to the will of God.</P>
<P>Of this the royal P&s;almi&s;t was deeply &s;en&s;ible, and it gave ri&s;e to his prayer, contained in the other pa&s;&s;age which has been read.&mdash;<HI>Deliver me from the oppre&s;&s;ion of man, &s;o will I keep thy precepts</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>This is an experimental declaration of one who was di&s;po&s;ed to wor&s;hip God and keep his pre|cepts, of the extream difficulty of doing &s;o, to any con&s;iderable advantage, while deprived of civil liberty, and oppre&s;&s;ed, and borne down, by the &s;uperior force and cruelty of lawle&s;s per|&s;ecutors.</P>
<P>The ca&s;e of our venerable New-England fore|fathers, who &s;uffered &s;o much at home, in the reign of James the fir&s;t, was in many re&s;pects &s;imilar to this, and an exemplification of the truth of it. Things did not pa&s;s well with them, ei|ther in church or &s;tate; they were treated with rigour, and denied the liberty of the Go&s;pel, and the enjoyment of the ordinances of God in their purity, by laws and mandates from both.</P>
<P>Mr. Robin&s;on's church in particular, the &s;eed whence this church grew, and many others have &s;ince branched, "was extremely harra&s;&s;ed; &s;ome ca&s;t into pri&s;on, &s;ome be&s;et in their hou&s;es, and &s;ome forced to leave their farms, and fami|lies", as has been witne&s;&s;ed by one, who was no
<PB N="14" REF="014118_0013_0F92FFBF6626AD88">
&s;mall &s;harer in their &s;ufferings, both in old Eng|land, and New.</P>
<P>And to their pious zeal, love of liberty, and magnanimity is it chiefly owing, under the &s;miles and guidance of providence, that the wilds of America are now &s;o immen&s;ely occupied by ci|vilized and chri&s;tian inhabitants.</P>
<P>The royal P&s;almi&s;t had before prayed, in the ver&s;e preceeding our text, again&s;t all inward hin|drance of duty and obedience; &s;uch as aro&s;e from evil inclination, and corrupt affections,&mdash; Order my &s;teps in thy word, &s;ays he, and let not any iniquity have dominion over me.</P>
<P>But &s;en&s;ible of another, and common tempta|tion to tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, and the neglect of God, he prays again&s;t this al&s;o in the text,&mdash;<HI>Deliver me from the oppre&s;&s;ion of man; &s;o will I keep thy pre|cepts.</HI></P>
<P>This he con&s;iders as a great outward impedi|ment in the way of his duty; but at the &s;ame time he was &s;o well per&s;waded of the di&s;po&s;ition of his own heart, as to think if it was but remo|ved, and he was delivered out of the hands of them that oppre&s;&s;ed him, he &s;hould go on in an even chearful cour&s;e of obedience to the precepts of God; though under his pre&s;ent circum&s;tan|ces, from the re&s;traint of his liberty, it was im|po&s;&s;ible for him to do it, according to his mind and con&s;cience.</P>
<P>If we take into con&s;ideration the effects pro|duced by oppre&s;&s;ion in the human mind,&mdash;the evil con&s;equences of it to &s;ociety, and the abate|ments of happine&s;s it occa&s;ions to individuals; or con&s;ult the &s;acred oracles, and the &s;everal di&s;|pen&s;ations of God towards mankind; we &s;hall
<PB N="15" REF="014118_0014_0F92FFC0378C94C0">
find that it has been his de&s;ign all along, to di&s;|countenance oppre&s;&s;ion in its various forms, and encourage and promote liberty in the world.</P>
<P>From our natural notions of the divine cha|racter, be&s;ides what we are taught by revelation, it may be argued, that the communication of happine&s;s, in co-incidence with his own glory, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> the great end propo&s;ed by God in the crea|tion of man.</P>
<P>He de&s;igned we &s;hould be happy in both worlds; and accordingly by our internal frame and furniture, and outward enjoyments, we are provided with all the materials that are nece&s;|&s;ary for this purpo&s;e; we are con&s;tituted with liberty, as well to exerci&s;e and improve our ra|tional faculties, as to make u&s;e of the ble&s;&s;ings and liberalities of providence.</P>
<P>By the principle of liberty, which is the &s;pring and animation of our rational exertions, we main|tain our &s;upremacy among the creatures of this lower world, which otherwi&s;e would annoy us; and by it we ta&s;te the &s;weets of the good things of life, and improve in piety and virtue, in divine and &s;ocial affections, in natural and moral &s;cience, and in all tho&s;e arts and accompli&s;hments, which perfect and adorn human nature, and make men happy.</P>
<P>It is, however, &s;ubject to great impediment and diminution, from various cau&s;es, but from none more, except our own lu&s;ts, than the oppre&s;&s;ions of our fellowmen.</P>
<P>Though the devil is the grand tyrant of man|kind, yet if we re&s;i&s;t him, he will flee from us; but the oppre&s;&s;ion of man may be &s;o e&s;tabli&s;hed, and triumphant, as to admit no hope, either of overcoming it by our own strength, or e&s;caping out of its hands.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="014118_0015_0F92FFC0F58B7D30">And when this is the ca&s;e, it produceth the wor&s;t effects in the human mind. It breaks its force, enervates and ob&s;cures its faculties, cramps the &s;pirits, de&s;troys emulation, and &s;naps the &s;inews of every exalted and virtuous de&s;ign.</P>
<P>The tempers, and di&s;po&s;itions of men are &s;trangely vitiated and changed by oppre&s;&s;ion. The brave and enterpri&s;ing grow irre&s;olute and &s;piritle&s;s&mdash;the &s;ocial and human, turn &s;ullen, un|feeling and vicious&mdash;the wicked pa&s;s on to high|er degrees of enormity, and the righteous decay; ob&s;tructed in their cour&s;e of obedience, they be|come heartle&s;s and unimproving.</P>
<P>The ble&s;&s;ings of life&mdash;the means of natural, ci|vil and moral improvements&mdash; the peace and tran|quility of &s;ociety, and the pro&s;pects of future happine&s;s, are greatly di&s;turbed and dimini&s;hed by it. And when it is carried to its extream, and begets confirmed &s;lavery, like &s;oil prepared to invigorate its proper &s;eed, it is productive of many &s;pecies of vice: Fal&s;hoods, thefts, and in|temperance grow out of it; which is a demon&s;tra|tive proof that the benevolent Creator never for|med the human nature for oppre&s;&s;ion, or origi|nally de&s;igned it &s;hould be &s;ubject to it.</P>

<P>From &s;uch hints, which will probably be more largely con&s;idered by &s;ome &s;ucce&s;&s;or, may be ju&s;tly argued, that God made man to be free; and that in proportion as they have lo&s;t their liberty in any true &s;en&s;e, the benevolent pur|po&s;es of the creator have &s;ome how, been impi|ou&s;ly and injuriou&s;ly counteracted in the world.</P>
<P>We &s;hall come to the &s;ame conclu&s;ion if we examine the accounts of the holy &s;criptures: It is manife&s;t from the dealings of God with mankind, recorded in them, that he has from the beginning, had a regard for liberty, and that tyrants, and oppre&s;&s;ors, have been the objects of his abhorrence.</P>
<P>Oppre&s;&s;ion and tyranny began to work in early ages, in the per&s;on and family of Cain, and &s;pread abroad its baneful influence, and pernicious effects among men; and when at length, by the unlawful mixtures of <HI>Seth's</HI> fa|mily with his elder brothers, the whole world became corrupt; and inju&s;tice, tyranny, and oppre&s;&s;ion prevailed; God manife&s;ted his di&s;plea|&s;ure again&s;t tho&s;e giants in wickedne&s;s, by invol|ving the whole human race, eight per&s;ons excep|ted, in one common ruin.</P>
<P>The miraculous deliverance of the children of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> from the Egyptian Bondage, is a very &s;ignal in&s;tance of God's appearing in favour of liberty, and frowning on tyrants; and it &s;hews how much he regards the rights of his people, and in how exemplary a manner, hard hearted tyrants, and mercile&s;s oppre&s;&s;ors, &s;ometimes feel his vengeance.</P>

<P>It ought not to be forgotten, that this was done, at a time, and in a manner peculiarly cal|culated and intended, to be a terror and warn|ing to the remote&s;t nations, and all future op|pre&s;&s;ors.</P>

<P>After they had been delivered out of the hou&s;e of bondage, God &s;aw &s;it to in&s;titute a certain form of mixed government among them, under which they were to be re&s;tored to the knowledge and practice of true religion, and the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their natural rights and liberties.

<P>At the time of their withdraw from the go|vernment of Jehovah, when they unwi&s;ely and ungratefully de&s;ired a change in their political &s;tate, and to come under the power of earthly Kings, God did not for&s;ake them; but on the contrary, manife&s;ted his concern for their welfare, and let them know how far, and in what re&s;pects, if they proceeded, they would be likely to be de|prived of their liberties, by ordering a de&s;cripti|on of the manner of their King to be laid before them: He will take your &s;ons and appoint them for him&s;elf; for his chariots, and to be his hor&s;e|men; and &s;ome &s;hall run before his chariots&mdash; and he will appoint him captains over thou&s;ands, and captain over fifties, and will &s;et them to ea<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"> his ground, and to reap his harve&s;t, and to make his in&s;truments of war, and in&s;truments of his chariots; and he will take your daughters to be confectionaries, and to be cooks, and to be bakers&mdash; and he will take your fields, and your vine|yards, and your olive yards, even the be&s;t of them,

<P>This is not a de&s;cription of what their Kings would have any right or ju&s;t authority to do; but of what their practice would be; if, as they reque&s;ted, they had a King like the other nations; unmindful of the common good, the only end of civil authority, they would treat their &s;ubjects in|juriou&s;ly, and make u&s;e of them and of their wealth for their own aggrandi&s;ement and evil de&s;ign, dive&s;ting them of that liberty, which they &s;o hap|pily enjoyed, under their former government.</P>
<P>The evident traces of the &s;pirit of liberty, di&s;|coverable in the writings of the &s;ucceeding Pro|phets, and running through them; the frequent denunciations of the divine judgments again&s;t ty|rants, and oppre&s;&s;ors, the names and images by which they characteri&s;e them, their predictions of their final overthrow, and of a time approaching before the end of the world, when righteou&s;ne&s;s and peace, truth and liberty, and happine&s;s &s;hall prevail, are other undeniable proofs of God's care to uphold the cau&s;e of liberty, and his purpo&s;e to render it finally triumphant over all the tyrants of the earth; tho&s;e bea&s;ts and dragons, as the Pro|phets call them, that is, deceivers and de&s;troy|ers of mankind.</P>
<P>The ancient Prophets were endowed with plen|tiful mea&s;ures of the &s;pirit of liberty; their brea&s;ts glowed with the &s;acred flame, and they had a ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of its nece&s;&s;ity to promote improve|ments both in a civil and religious view. Far from

thinking it a pro&s;titution of their &s;acred office, they on the contrary, con&s;idered it as part of the duty of it, to give their voice in favour of liber|ty, and &s;peak as they often did, in the &s;evere&s;t language, and warme&s;t &s;trains of indignant elo|quence again&s;t oppre&s;&s;ive powers and domineer|ing tyrants.</P>
<P>If we will now look into the writings of the new te&s;tament, we &s;hall find that they are friend|ly to the cau&s;e of liberty.</P>
<P>In the mo&s;t perfect &s;en&s;e of it, intending free|dom from the bondage of &s;atan and our own lu&s;ts, it was the great object of Chri&s;t's undertaking; and agreeably He applied to him&s;elf what had been long before te&s;tified of Him, by the &s;pirit of prophecy&mdash;the &s;pirit of the Lord is upon me, be|cau&s;e he hath anointed me to preach the go&s;pel to the poor, He hath &s;ent me to heal the broken hearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering &s;ight to the blind, to &s;et at liberty them that are brui&s;ed. It is &s;aid that the law of the &s;pirit of life in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, maketh free from the law of &s;in and death; and if the Son make us free, we &s;hall be free indeed.</P>
<P>'Tis allowed that when Chri&s;t was in the world working out the redemption of &s;inners, He did not &s;ay many things concerning civil govern|ment and poltical liberty: Freedom of a far more important nature employ'd his time and thoughts: and his &s;ilence in this regard, has been turned into an argument by &s;ome, that the mini&s;ters of religion depart from the duty of their office, and act out of character, when in any &s;tate of our public affairs, they make &s;uch matters &s;ubjects of their di&s;cour&s;es from the pulpit, or even in private conver&s;ation.

that might be replied, it ought to be remember|ed, that the Prophets before, and the Apo&s;tles after him, were not &s;o &s;paring; and this I think is a &s;olid proof, either that his &s;ilence was not in|tended as an example, or that &s;ome of the in&s;pir|ed Apo&s;tles at lea&s;t mi&s;under&s;tood it.</P>
<P>There were &s;pecial prudential rea&s;ons why Chri&s;t, 'till He had fini&s;hed the work of his mini|&s;try, and fulfilled every thing in the &s;criptures concerning Him, &s;hould avoid &s;peaking with any degree of freedom and openne&s;s of matters of government and the civil liberties of mankind. "The Jews were continually laying weight for &s;omething to accu&s;e Him of to the Romans, tempting Him, and trying all methods to draw Him into any act, which might be con&s;trued trea&s;on, or di&s;affection to their government".</P>
<P>And con&s;idering the great wickedne&s;s of the Jews in that age, and their particular malignity again&s;t Chri&s;t, together with the u&s;urpations and encroachments of &s;ome of the roman magi&s;trates, had He &s;aid almo&s;t any thing of civil rights, they would have charged Him with &s;edition and trea|&s;on. For &s;imilar rea&s;ons, He declined any direct an&s;wer, when que&s;tioned about his being the Me&s;&s;iah, and &s;ome other matters; and it is hoped mini&s;ters will not be blamed for treating on the me&s;&s;iah&s;hip of Chri&s;t, becau&s;e He him&s;elf had &s;ometimes good rea&s;ons to be cautious.</P>
<P>But though Chri&s;t did not think proper to de|cide any thing, as to civil rights in particular ca&s;es; yet from what He &s;aid, on &s;everal occa&s;i|ons, we may learn his &s;entiments on the &s;ubject of liberty, and government in general.</P>
<P>He not only bore te&s;timony again&s;t &s;piritual tyranny, and the undue claims of power, in the Scribes and Phari&s;ees&mdash;He not only intimated his dete&s;tation ot per&s;ecution, when He advi&s;ed

He al&s;o expre&s;sly commanded to render unto Ce&s;ar the things that are Ce&s;ar's, and unto God the things that are God's; the natural &s;en&s;e of which precept is this, that men &s;hould give tribute and cu&s;tom, re&s;pect and obe|dience, to tho&s;e cloathed with lawful authority, as far as they are due, and nece&s;&s;ary to an&s;wer the ends of government, but that they are to make no encroachments on the things of God, which are likewi&s;e to be given to him, things pertaining to his &s;ervice, appropriated to his wor&s;hip; the rights of con&s;cience and natural rights and liberties, which are the donations of his goodne&s;s&punc; and nece&s;&s;ary to the pre&s;ervation of that peace and order, and ju&s;tice among men, which He hath ordained.</P>
<P>In this precept much is &s;aid in little, relative to civil government; &s;uch prudence is di&s;played, as was &s;ufficient to avoid the &s;nare that was laid for Him, and at the &s;ame time, the mo&s;t perfect ge|neral rule is given for the guidance of magi&s;trates and people, and rendering &s;ociety happy.</P>
<P>Among the apo&s;tles, St. Paul in his epi&s;tle to the Romans, hath explicitly &s;poken of civil go|vernment, and pointed out the ends of it, the duty of magi&s;trates, and the ground of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to their authority in the mo&s;t conci&s;e and in&s;truc|tive manner.</P>

liberty; it was of a piece with his doctrine, and is the be&s;t comment upon it.</P>
<P>There was a remarkable di&s;play of the &s;pirit of liberty in his behavior, when on a fal&s;e accu|&s;ation, and without legal proce&s;s, he and Silas were, by order of the magi&s;trates, beaten and ca&s;t into Pri&s;on, and their feet made fa&s;t in the &s;tocks.</P>
<P>The magi&s;trates, terrified by an earthquake, &s;ent the &s;erjeants to relea&s;e them, but Paul, animated by the &s;pirit of liberty, even in a goal, and &s;en&s;ible that his rights had been invaded; in&s;i&s;ted on a practical acknowledgment of it, from the magi&s;trates them&s;elves&mdash;Paul &s;aid unto them, they have beaten us openly, uncondem|ned, being Romans, and have ca&s;t us into pri&s;on; and now do they thru&s;t us out privily? nay veri|ly!&mdash;but let them come them&s;elves, and fetch us out.</P>
<P>The &s;erjeants reported the&s;e words to the ma|gi&s;trates, and they feared when they heard they were Romans. They knew they had injured them by depriving them of liberty, who were as free as them&s;elves, and had as good a right to the privileges and protection of the roman govern|ment; ju&s;t as the Americans, by nature and char|ter, are entitled to the &s;ame rights and liberties as Britons, or as they them&s;elves would have en|joyed, had they been born within the realm of England.</P>
<P>It is, however, hard for exalted characters, who have been u&s;ed to have their orders executed, to bring them&s;elves to make conce&s;&s;ions; but the magi&s;trates were overawed by the earthquake, and from other con&s;iderations al&s;o, they found unnece&s;&s;ary to come per&s;onally, and by entreaties make up the matter&mdash;they came and be&s;ought them, and brought them out.</P>

<P>But they had good rea&s;on for their conduct; they knew the value of liberty, and its impor|tance to mankind, and they cho&s;e rather to &s;uffer the cruelty, and ignominy of a goal, a while lon|ger, than not bear &s;ufficient te&s;timony again&s;t &s;uch magi&s;trates as had unju&s;tly invaded it.</P>
<P>Their behaviour in this affair may be con&s;ider|ed, as having re&s;pect to them&s;elves and others; as to them&s;elves, they were &s;en&s;ible if they did not improve this opportunity, to induce the magi&s;trates who had done the injury to make reparation; other magi&s;trates would not be &s;o likely to be deterred from a &s;imilar practice, nor the&s;e &s;o effec|tually prevented from repeating the abu&s;e, and perhaps carrying it to a greater extremity, when the horrors of the earthquake were gone off.&mdash; And as to other men, who&s;e welfare they were obliged to promote, they knew if they did not bring their oppre&s;&s;ors to acknowledge the inju&s;tice they had been guilty of, in denying them the liberties of Romans, they &s;hould &s;et an example of ill influence to all who might afterwards be oppre&s;&s;ed, and encourage magi&s;trates to go any lengths in this ill treatment of &s;ubjects.

cloathed with authority, but he was always &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ive to magi&s;trates acting in their line, and rea|dy to be governed and judged by the law.</P>
<P>If it &s;hould be enquired why the&s;e in&s;tances of Paul's conduct relative to civil liberty are handed down to us, &s;ince it was his chief bu&s;ine&s;s to in|&s;truct men in the great doctrines and duties of re|ligion; it may be &s;aid, that among other rea&s;ons, which I need not mention, a probable one is, to let us know, the &s;en&s;e he had of the connection between religious and civil liberty, and that the former cannot be expected to exi&s;t, but upon the ba&s;is of the latter.</P>
<P>The conduct and di&s;cour&s;es of the Apo&s;tles, whenever they had occa&s;ion to &s;peak of civil li|berty, were always friendly to its cau&s;e, and a re|proof of tyranny and u&s;urpation; &mdash; the great principle which they ever acted from them&s;elves, and inculcated on others was, that we ought to obey God rather than man.</P>
<P>Although agreeable to what their Lord had &s;aid, they looked on them&s;elves and all chri&s;tians, as belonging to a &s;ociety totally different from ci|vil &s;tates, &s;ubjects of a kingdom which is not of this world; yet as the free exerci&s;e of the external offices of this peculiar kingdom, mu&s;t in &s;uch a world as this, and among &s;uch inhabi|tants, greatly depend on the equity, impartiality and freedom of civil government, and as in this re&s;pect it was more, and in every laudable world|ly re&s;pect, as much the intere&s;t of chri&s;tians, as of other men, to live under &s;uch a government, they made con&s;cience as 'tis natural to &s;uppo&s;e they would, of &s;peaking and acting on proper occa&s;ions, in a manner that had a tendency to re|commend it to mankind.</P>
<P>Civil liberty, which it&s;elf is an object of great moment, is &s;ometimes &s;poken of by the &s;acred
<PB N="31" REF="014118_0030_0F92FF500AD193B8">
penmen, in both te&s;taments, for its own &s;ake; at other times on the account of its &s;alutary influ|ence and effects on religious liberty.</P>
<P>Enough has been &s;aid by the ancient Prophets, and by Chri&s;t and the Apo&s;tles, to convince us that they had a mo&s;t tender regard for the natural and civil rights of mankind, and an abhorrence of all &s;piritual tyranny and domination.</P>
<P>Chri&s;t has told us that the members of his my&s;tical body, the church, are brethren&mdash;there are to be no ma&s;ters among them&mdash;no authority ex|erci&s;ed over the faith or con&s;ciences of any&mdash; one is our ma&s;ter, even Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>The Apo&s;tle Peter, who was him&s;elf an elder, hath &s;trictly prohibited the elders of the flock, lording it over God's heritage.</P>
<P>And whoever are guilty of &s;uch u&s;urpation, though dignified among men, and di&s;tingui&s;hed by the epithets of right reverend, and even his Holine&s;s, are liable to the reproof admini&s;tred by the Prophet to the ancient &s;hepherds of I&s;rael; wo be to the &s;hepherds of I&s;rael that do feed them|&s;elves; &s;hould not the &s;hepherds feed the flock? ye eat the fat, and ye cloath you with the wool, ye kill them that are fed; but ye feed not the flock, the di&s;ea&s;ed have ye not &s;trengthned, neither have ye healed that which was &s;ick, neither have ye bound up that which was broken, neither have ye bro't again that which was driven away, neither have ye &s;ought that which was lo&s;t; but with force and with cruelty have ye ruled them.</P>
<P>At the time St. Paul had occa&s;ion to u&s;e friend|ly &s;everity, at lea&s;t with &s;ome of the Corinthians, he expre&s;sly di&s;claimed dominion over their faith, a&s;&s;igning this good rea&s;on for it, by faith ye &s;tand.</P>
<P>Had we time to con&s;ider more largely the na|ture and genius of the religion of the Bible, its
<PB N="32" REF="014118_0031_0F92FF507B0A6528">
various requirements, and the principles, affecti|ons and duties it enjoins; the divine regards both to civil and religious liberty, and God's intention to promote it among men, would appear in a &s;trong and irre&s;i&s;table point of light.</P>
<P>That temper and conduct&mdash;that love of God and man, and tho&s;e divine and &s;ocial virtues, every where recommended; particularly that imi|tation of Chri&s;t, or corre&s;pondence of heart and life to his example, which are e&s;&s;ential parts of his religion, are admirably calculated to &s;ecure the natural and religious rights and liberties of mankind, and put an end to the mi&s;eries of op|pre&s;&s;ion and tyranny.</P>
<P>Chri&s;t not only &s;et us an example of uni|ver&s;al benevolence, but of the love of our coun|try as con&s;i&s;tent with it; like a true patriot he had a peculiar concern for the welfare of his own nation, and &s;pent his life in the mo&s;t benefi|cent actions among them, and he could not call to mind the calamities he knew they were about to &s;uffer in con&s;equence of their ob&s;tinacy and unbelief, but with the tendere&s;t emotions of com|pa&s;&s;ion and grief.</P>
<P>And &s;o far as men partake of his &s;pirit, and are actuated by the principles of his religion, be they magi&s;trates or &s;ubjects, they will be led to a behaviour tending to &s;upport the general cau&s;e of liberty, and the particular freedom and pro&s;|perity of their own country.</P>
<P>It was, indeed, the great intention of Chri&s;t, to introduce men into a &s;tate of &s;piritual liber|ty; that being made free from &s;in, and become &s;ervants to God, they might have their fruit unto holine&s;s, and the end everla&s;ting life; but as his religion is formed to produce this effect, by reinforcing doctrines and principles, that
<PB N="33" REF="014118_0032_0F92FF512D3A5E80">
have a tendency, to &s;ubdue tho&s;e lu&s;ts and cor|ruptions that en&s;lave the mind, and to influence men to practi&s;e tho&s;e virtues in which the free|dom of the &s;oul con&s;i&s;ts; and as the a&s;&s;i&s;tances and co-operations of the divine &s;pirit are provi|ded to break the yoke of &s;atan and replace our &s;ouls in a &s;tate of moral &s;trength and freedom, which is the pure&s;t and mo&s;t perfect idea and condition of freedom we are capable of; &s;o in virtue of the &s;ame influence and tendency, his religion contributes to the pre&s;ervation and e&s;ta|bli&s;hment of liberty in civil and religious &s;ocie|ties. For, in proportion as the minds of individu|als are made free from &s;in, and the virtues of the Go&s;pel are practi&s;ed; oppre&s;&s;ion and tyranny mu&s;t cea&s;e, and liberty revive and prevail every where, both in church and &s;tate.</P>
<P>May therefore a deep &s;en&s;e of religion impre&s;s the minds, and influence the conduct of all men! and tho&s;e happy times, we are taught to ex|pect, come on! when the power of oppre&s;&s;ion &s;hall be bani&s;hed from the world; and a King &s;hall reign and pro&s;per, who &s;hall execute judg|ment, and ju&s;tice in the earth; and there &s;hall be nothing to hurt or de&s;troy in all God's holy mountain.</P>
<P>It only remains that we make a few reflecti|ons, or inferences from what has been di&s;cour|&s;ed, and conclude with them.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, We &s;ee what rea&s;on we have to admire and adore the wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s of God, in con&s;tituting a religion for us, which, while it provides for the moral liberty of our &s;ouls, and our everla&s;ting happine&s;s in another world, hath not been unmindful of the rights of con|&s;cience, and the civil liberties of &s;ociety, in this.</P>
<P>Liberty is the &s;pirit and genius of the &s;acred writings; the great thing aimed at in them, is
<PB N="34" REF="014118_0033_0F92FF51E33C2C10">
to make men free from &s;in; to deliver them out of bondage to their lu&s;ts, and procure and e&s;ta|bli&s;h the moral freedom of their minds.</P>
<P>But though this be their main object, yet as liberty in any important &s;en&s;e, civil or religious, is friendly to the cau&s;e of godline&s;s, &s;tands in con|nection with it, and has its influence into the &s;piritual freedom of the &s;oul; they have taken care by enjoining &s;elf government, the generous affections and a righteous behaviour towards men, to provide for this kind of liberty in human &s;ociety.</P>
<P>A ju&s;t regard for the authority of the in&s;pired word, will mo&s;t effectually &s;ecure and promote it.</P>
<P>As far as the liberty of mankind has been im|paired, and their rights invaded, and oppre&s;&s;ion and tyranny have prevailed in any kingdom or nation on earth; &s;o far has there been a repug|nance to, and a departure from the true &s;pirit of the holy &s;criptures.</P>
<P>The religion of the Bible hath a regard to our benefit in both worlds, it con&s;i&s;ts of &s;uch principles, duties and virtues, as are adapted to the human nature and circum&s;tances; it is &s;o contri|ved as to deliver us from the va&s;&s;alage of our lu&s;ts, and the oppre&s;&s;ion of man, by the &s;ame di|vine energy&mdash;it forms our tempers to the re|&s;emblance of God, and di&s;po&s;es us for the &s;ub|lime exerci&s;es, and refined enjoyments of his hea|venly Kingdom; at the &s;ame time, and by the &s;ame means, that it promotes our be&s;t intere&s;t, peace and quietne&s;s on earth&mdash;godline&s;s hath the promi&s;e of the life that now is, and of that which is to come.</P>
<P>This is a con&s;ideration that demands our war|me&s;t gratitude; and while our hearts are enlar|ged, and our mouths filled with the prai&s;es of God for &s;o rich and ine&s;timable a ble&s;&s;ing, may
<PB N="35" REF="014118_0034_0F92FF52A15F6D30">
it be our care to devote our&s;elves forever to his &s;ervice; and improve our religious advantages, according to their gracious de&s;ign and tendency, for the promotion both of our pre&s;ent and future happine&s;s.</P>
<P>Secondly; If religion is eminently productive of liberty, and the &s;ecurity of it; we are led, from the remarkable di&s;play of liberty in the great undertaking of our fore-fathers, to form a favourable judgment of their religion, and to believe it was pure and undefiled, and according to knowledge, in oppo&s;ition to enthu&s;iastic rant and fanatici&s;im. There have been indeed, many in&s;tances of the love of liberty among a people, who&s;e religion has been no other than pagan; and no marvel; it is a natural pa&s;&s;ion, capable however, of being &s;trengthened by religion; and is u&s;ually the &s;tronge&s;t, where religion is the pure&s;t and the mo&s;t divine.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the names of our illu&s;trious ance&s;tors have been traduced, and their religion que&s;tioned, and even vilified by &s;ome, as the ravings of a di&s;ordered mind, or the effects of ignorance and &s;uper&s;tition, an abu&s;e which few e&s;caped who were di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of puritans; yet the charitable as well as probable opinion is, that they were men of real piety and godline&s;s; and that like David of old, they de&s;ired to get out of the hands of their oppre&s;|&s;ors, that they might have more liberty to keep God's precepts, and wor&s;hip and &s;erve him ac|cording to the light of their own con&s;ciences.</P>
<P>I am not &s;en&s;ible of any bias, though I would not be too confident, from an undue veneration for antiquity, or for the &s;uperior knowledge and di&s;cernment of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> whom we commonly call the Fathers&punc; but with re&s;pect to the fathers of New-England, the more I am acquainted with their hi&s;|tory
<PB N="36" REF="014118_0035_0F92FF54D2C2CBA0">
and minutely enquire into their religion and morality, and particular behaviour towards the natives of this land, the greater rea&s;on have I to be per&s;waded, that their religion was derived from the fountain of truth, and therefore real and &s;ub|&s;tantial.</P>
<P>It appears to have had the marks of divinity upon it, and to have been founded on the pro|per ba&s;is of all religion&mdash;the love of God; and that charity to man, that bond of peace and of all virtues, made a very con&s;picuous part of it.</P>
<P>At the time of our Fathers abandoning their native country, many things were out of order in the &s;tate, and they had rea&s;on to complain of the too arbitrary and undue exerci&s;e of the pow|ers of government. But their chief motive in it was religion; freedom of wor&s;hipping God agreeably to the rule of his word, and the dictates of their own minds</P>
<P>Religion was precious in their eyes; they were willing to leave hou&s;es and lands, and many dear and valuable po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, for the &s;ake of enjoying it in its purity. But they were men, and like other good men they were liable to, and had their failings; its well they had no more.</P>
<P>When we recollect the cruel treatment they met with from their brethren at home, and their &s;ufferings abroad; the difficulties and perils of their voyage, and the many hard&s;hips and dan|gers they encountered after they had arrived, in this &s;ea&s;on of the year, to the&s;e dark and unfriend|ly &s;hores; their un&s;haken fortitude and patient &s;uffering of affliction in the cau&s;e of religion, fill our minds with equal plea&s;ure and a&s;toni&s;hment.</P>
<P>We ought doubtle&s;s to con&s;ider it, as an argu|ment of the love of God ruling in their hearts, and of his grace abiding with them, and &s;upport|ing them with the &s;tedfa&s;t hope of good things
<PB N="37" REF="014118_0036_0F92FF550BD51938">
to come; that under &s;uch tryals, their &s;pirits were not broken, and their tempers &s;oured to di&s;tru&s;t, peevi&s;hne&s;s and vice.</P>
<P>It may, I believe, be ju&s;tly affirmed, that their devotedne&s;s to God and his cau&s;e, their regard for the holy &s;criptures, and love of the truth as it is in Je&s;us, their faithfulne&s;s to them&s;elves and po&s;terity, and their a&s;&s;iduous care and endeavours to tran&s;mit their religion uncorrupted, and their liberties unimpaired to remote&s;t ages; are to be equalled but by few in&s;tances, and perhaps &s;ur|pa&s;&s;ed by none, &s;ince the days of in&s;piration.</P>
<P>Their hi&s;tory, if faithfully recorded, will &s;hine with a peculiar lu&s;tre, in the annals of the church, down to its late&s;t period in this militant &s;tate.</P>
<P>To us e&s;pecially, who are entered on their la|bours, as our natural inheritance, and who, till of late years, have largely partaken of the happy fruits of their virtuous &s;ufferings, and many toils, both in church and &s;tate; and believe we &s;hall again partake of them; their names are ju&s;tly ve|nerable: But we intend no more than a decent expre&s;&s;ion of filial re&s;pect, when on this anniver|&s;ary, we their children, ri&s;e up, and call them ble&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>Their example, however, as far as it was for|med, by the love of religion and liberty, and the grace of God that was in them, ought to be regarded by us, and improved for the more per|fect accompli&s;hing of their great and pious de&s;igns.</P>
<P>In this view, we cannot but approve the late conduct of the town of Plymouth, in devoting the anniver&s;ary of our fore-fathers landing here, to a religious u&s;e, and a grateful recollection of the care of providence, in bringing about &s;o memo|rable an event.</P>
<P>Much benefit, if I mi&s;take not, both to our|&s;elves, and po&s;terity, may grow out of the de|&s;ign; if it be but ob&s;erved with &s;obriety, and
<PB N="38" REF="014118_0037_0F92FF55A0EA8768">
temperance, as a civil and religious fe&s;tivity, and not &s;uffered to degenerate into carnal mirth, and the works of darkne&s;s.</P>
<P>Thirdly&mdash;We learn that no man in communi|ty, of any rank or character whatever, can be unintere&s;ted in the cau&s;e of liberty; or lawfully neglect it; much le&s;s make u&s;e of his influence in oppo&s;ing and bearing it down.</P>
<P>It is a common cau&s;e, and the right of nature. Every man that is born into the world, as Mr. Lock, that prince of philo&s;ophers hath &s;aid, "is born to it," and every member of civil and religious &s;ociety has an unalienable title to, and concern in it; and is bound by the mo&s;t &s;acred and indi&s;&s;oluble ties, in a ju&s;t exertion of his abi|lities and by every adequate method, to &s;pread the love of it among mankind, and defend it, again&s;t tyrants and oppre&s;&s;ors.</P>
<P>This ob&s;ervation comes with too &s;elf-evident clearne&s;s, and force, to the rea&s;on of man, to admit of avowed oppo&s;ition from any, but yet in the political di&s;putes in which we are at pre|&s;ent, unhappily involved with our fellow &s;ubjects at home, there are &s;ome in the mid&s;t of us, and hard as it may be to believe it, &s;uch as are de&s;cended from our worthy ance&s;tors, who from a mi&s;appre|hen&s;ion of the nature and ju&s;t extent of the mi|ni&s;terial office, have pretended to deny it, in re|gard to the clergy in particular; and have u&s;ed &s;ome feeble and uncouth attempts to wre&s;t it out of their hands. The conduct however, of the holy Prophets and Apo&s;tles, the firm and open &s;pirit with which they delivered their &s;en|timents, on the &s;ubject of liberty, and bare te&s;ti|mony again&s;t lawle&s;s oppre&s;&s;ors, though igno|rantly pa&s;&s;ed over by them, will be di&s;cerned by others, to afford example to the ordinary mi|ni&s;ters of religion, and authori&s;e them, in their
<PB N="39" REF="014118_0038_0F92FF569E9B6360">
public and private addre&s;&s;es to u&s;e their influ|ence, if any they have, in &s;upporting and che|ri&s;hing the cau&s;e of liberty.</P>
<P>This is not barely a right that may be exer|ci&s;ed or neglected at plea&s;ure, but the duty of all ranks of men in &s;ociety; no one is, or can be, ex|empted. Liberty is the cau&s;e of all, and all &s;hould be ready to &s;pend, and be &s;pent in its &s;ervice.</P>
<P>Political apo&s;tates, and other paricides will not indeed admit, though they cannot deny &s;uch doc|trine; it were to be wi&s;hed there was no occa&s;ion to &s;ay that their unexampled behaviour, in this day of anxiety and conte&s;t, when the rights of all the colonies are the &s;take, is too manife&s;tly calculated according to the weight of its influ|ence, to cut up the liberties of America by the roots, and cool the pa&s;&s;ion, and ob&s;cure the &s;en&s;e of them in the brea&s;ts of their fellow country|men. At the &s;ame time, &s;trange to relate! They fondly a&s;&s;ume, and by a&s;&s;uming prophane the re&s;pectable characters of loyalty and friends to government! Solicitous to hide from the world, and if po&s;&s;ible from them&s;elves, their unhallowed views of ambition and avarice, under the cover of venerable forms, as the grand apo&s;tate &s;pirit him&s;elf is &s;ometimes transformed into an angel of light, to accompli&s;h the baneful de&s;igns of the kingdom of darkne&s;s. Notwith&s;tanding, when they &s;hall make their cordial &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions to their much injured country, and &s;eek reconciliation with it, we may forgive, but it will be a hard thing to forget their crimes.</P>
<P>Fourthly, As liberty is the right of nature, confirmed to us by revelation, and e&s;&s;ential to our happine&s;s, we ought to be deeply humbled un|der the tokens of the divine re&s;entments, in &s;uf|fering &s;o great an adver&s;ity to befal us, as that of being obliged to contend for it in oppo&s;ition to
<PB N="40" REF="014118_0039_0F92FF5A8DD09730">
mea&s;ures contrived to deprive us of &s;o rich a ble&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P>When the righteous providence of God, which in the friendle&s;s and defencele&s;s &s;tate of our pious ance&s;tors, conde&s;cended to be their &s;un and &s;hield, the vigilant and almighty guardian of their per|&s;ons, families and rights, hath &s;een it nece&s;&s;ary to correct the growing infidelity, immorality and prophanene&s;s of their degenerate offspring, by permitting a thick cloud to gather over our heads, and invelope the American colonies in darkne&s;s, &s;ome humiliating reflections ought to intermix with the joy and gratitude of the day.</P>
<P>We ju&s;tify the ways of providence in all that is come upon us&mdash;the Lord hath done right, but we have done wickedly&mdash;our &s;ins have been the procuring moral cau&s;e of the Judgments we feel, and we ought to be humble before God, and re|pent and amend our ways and doings; but yet with regard to man, we are greatly injured, we have rea&s;on to complain, and may ju&s;tly a&s;&s;ert our rights, and maintain our cau&s;e again&s;t them.</P>
<P>A more grievous misfortune however, could not befal us than this; we deeply lament it! We deprecate a contention with the parent &s;tate! It is the burden of America, and under the weight of it we are all ready to enquire with anxious hearts, watchman, what of the night? watch|man, what of the night? is there any good news from our mother country? any thing to rai&s;e the hopes of our own? can America en|ertain expectations from briti&s;h ju&s;tice or paren|tal &s;ympathy of a deliverance out of her di&s;tre&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>In a &s;ituation &s;o gloomy, let us commit our cau&s;e unto him who judge&s;t righteou&s;ly, and lift up our heartt to God in the heavens, in earne&s;t prayer and &s;upplication&mdash;tru&s;t in him at all times,
<PB N="41" REF="014118_0040_0F92FF5C8A341750">
oh ye people, pour out your hearts before him. Our expectation is from God. He is our &s;alvation and our glory, the rock of our &s;trength, and our refuge is in God.</P>
<P>The great affairs of &s;tates and kingdoms, are &s;ubject to his controul and governance. He chan|geth times and &s;ea&s;ons; the hearts of Kings and of all men are in his hands, and He turneth them as rivers of water are turned. In the mid&s;t of our perplexity and fear, then let us look to God, who is high above all nations, and who&s;e glory is above the heavens; and may we all as one man, break off our &s;ins by repentance, and our iniqui|ties by turning to the Lord; if we will thus pe|nitently betake our&s;elves to him, though He hath &s;mitten us, He will bind us up; his going forth is prepared as the morning, and He &s;hall come unto us as the rain, as the latter and former rain, unto the earth.</P>
<P>Fifthly, Con&s;idering that the rights and liber|ties of the colonies are &s;o important ble&s;&s;ings, de|rived to us from the divine goodne&s;s, through the hands of our adventurous fore-fathers, it is hoped we &s;hall not &s;upinely &s;uffer them to &s;lip out of our po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, or be wanting in any in|&s;tances of &s;elf-denial, and other wi&s;e and effectu|al means, to &s;ecure them to the pre&s;ent, and tran&s;mit them to future generations.</P>
<P>The alarm that is gone forth through the land, and the a&s;&s;iduous attention given to our public affairs, by all ranks, ages and &s;exes a|mong us, we cannot but e&s;teem a token for good, a &s;ymptom of vital &s;trength, in the body po|litic, though &s;ome of its members are mutilated and maimed; nor can we atribute the firm u|nion and coment of our numerous colonies and the general agreement of their <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> of oppo&s;ition, to <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> mea|sures,
<PB N="42" REF="014118_0041_0F92FF5DC4513598">
to any principle &s;o ju&s;tly, as the effica|cy of the divine influence on the minds of men.</P>
<P>Judging from appearances, we have rea&s;on to hope, and believe, that God him&s;elf has ri&s;en to work out our &s;alvation.</P>
<P>Let us not provoke him to withdraw the influences of his providence, by our own in|activity and neglect.</P>
<P>God u&s;ually worketh by means and in&s;tru|ments, in accompli&s;hing the great purpo&s;es of his providence among men; we have no rea&s;on from analogy, to expect a deliverance out of our political evils, by the immediate exertion of al|mighty power; we mu&s;t work our&s;elves, with a due dependance on the divine energy and ble&s;&s;ing, and then, from the ju&s;tice of our cau&s;e, may we expect that God will work with us and in us, and crown our endeavours with &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>The honourable, and much e&s;teemed Ame|rican Continental Congre&s;s, whom we volunta|rily con&s;tituted the guardians of our rights, have with great judgment and faithfulne&s;s, point|ed us to a mode of conduct, from which, if religiou&s;ly adhered to by our&s;elves, and follow|ed with the divine ble&s;&s;ing, we may entertain the &s;tronge&s;t hopes.</P>
<P>It is at once calculated to procure a radical redre&s;s of American grievances, and to promote the future peace, harmony and pro&s;peri|ty both of Great-Britain, and the colonies.&mdash;It &s;hews that we contend for nothing but our own, that we aim at nothing but our rights, and wi&s;h and pray for nothing more ardently in this world, than a reconciliation and la&s;t|ing connection with our brethren at home: If it &s;ucceeds, we are mutually happy; if not, as

the wi&s;e&s;t &s;chemes of men may prove abortive, thro' the corruption and wickedne&s;s of &s;ome other, it will at lea&s;t manife&s;t to the whole world, that the demands of America are ju&s;t, and her di&s;po&s;ition loyal and pacific.</P>
<P>And then, when the wor&s;t of events com|eth, to which that re&s;pectable body have in the mean time advi&s;ed us to extend our views, and be prepared for, we may with firm hope and humble reliance, implore the aids of his providence, who is the almighty avenger of wrongs, with whom is wi&s;dom and &s;trength, who poureth contempt upon princes, and weak|neth the &s;trength of the mighty, who lead|eth councellors away &s;poiled, and maketh the judges fools.</P>
<P>To conclude, Upon a retro&s;pective view of our fore-fathers coming over into this land, the cau&s;es moving them to it&mdash;the pious de|&s;igns they had in it&mdash;the many hard&s;hips and perils attending it, and the foundation hereby laid for u&s;eful improvements in the arts of ci|vilized life, commerce and literature; but e&s;|pecially in the knowledge and practice of the chri&s;tian religion, where ignorance and barba|ri&s;m had before prevailed for unknown ages; we ought to be very thankful to almighty God for the peculiar care and guardian&s;hip of his providence, &s;o con&s;picuous in every part of this grand enterprize.</P>
<P>God was with them of a truth, encourage|ing and defending them, and carrying them through difficulties and perils in a wonderful manner, which demands our particular atten|tion and grateful acknowledgments this day.</P>
<P>He had, doubtle&s;s, great and wi&s;e purpo&s;es to &s;erve, in leading them into this barbarous and exten&s;ive wilderne&s;s, which we have rea|&s;on

to believe, are far from having yet been wholly accompli&s;hed.</P>
<P>It is remarkable, that in the many threat|ning dangers that be&s;et our Fathers in early time, from the wicked machinations of open enemies, or the &s;ecret plots of treacherous and fal&s;e-hearted friends, and that have &s;ince, even down to the pre&s;ent day, be&s;et us, God hath always appeared on our &s;ide, and deliver|ed us out of all our fears and di&s;tre&s;&s;es, and we tru&s;t he will &s;till deliver us.</P>
<P>Not unto us, oh Lord, not unto us, but un|to thy name be the glory.</P>
<P>It is not for &s;hort-&s;ighted mortals to fathom the coun&s;els of the mo&s;t high God: His Judg|ments are un&s;earchable; and his ways pa&s;t find|ing out.</P>
<P>But if it be lawful to permit our thoughts to delight us with contemplations on futurity; the American de&s;ert rejoices and blo&s;&s;oms as a ro&s;e, cities and empires ri&s;e, arts and &s;ciences flouri&s;h, and the &s;olitary places are glad. How great is the goodne&s;s of the Lord, and how great is his beauty! The time cometh, when old men and old women &s;hall dwell in our &s;treets, every man with his &s;taff in his hand for very age; when corn &s;hall make the young men cheer|ful, and new wine the maids, and our cities &s;hall be full of boys and girls, playing in our &s;treets. But above all, when the aboriginal na|tions &s;hall bow the knee at the name of Je|&s;us, and confe&s;s him to be Lord, to the glory of God the Father; and pure and undefiled reli|gion &s;hall prevail in the land, and there &s;hall be one Lord, and his name one.</P>
