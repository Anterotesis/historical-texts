<HEAD>PREFACE To the SECOND VOLUME.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN the fir&s;t volume was print|ed, I had not &s;een the
"Political Annals"
of the American Colonies, pub|li&s;hed in 1780, by George Chalmers, E&s;q. This gentleman, being in England, was favored with &s;ome advantages, of which I was de&s;titute; having acce&s;s to the books and papers of the Lords of Trade and Plantations, from the fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hment of that Board. He &s;eems to po&s;&s;e&s;s the diligence and patience which are nece&s;&s;a|ry in a hi&s;torian; but either through in|advertence or want of candor, has made &s;ome mi&s;repre&s;entations re&s;pecting New-Hamp&s;hire, on which I &s;hall take the lib|erty to remark.</P>
<P>In page 491, &s;peaking of the fir&s;t Coun|cil, of which Pre&s;ident CUTTS was at the head, he &s;ays,
<Q>they refu&s;ed to take the accu&s;tomed oaths, as the Engli&s;h law required, becau&s;e liberty of con&s;cience was allowed them.</Q>
In the fir&s;t volume of my hi&s;tory, page 176, I have &s;aid,
<Q>they
<PB N="iv" REF="023166_0003_0FBC76ECDCA1E138">
publi&s;hed the commi&s;&s;ion and took the oaths;</Q>
for which I cited the Council records; and on recurring to them, I find the following entry, in the hand writing of Elias Stileman, Secretary.</P>
<Q><P><HI>January</HI> 21, 1679&mdash;80.</P>
<P>His Maje&s;ty's Commi&s;&s;ioners, nomy|nated in &s;aid commi&s;&s;ion, tooke their re&s;pective oathes, as menconed in &s;aid commi&s;&s;ion.</P></Q>
<P>That the oaths were really taken, is a fact beyond all di&s;pute; but if there is any ground for what Mr. Chalmers is plea&s;ed to call a refu&s;al, it mu&s;t have been re&s;pecting the <HI>form</HI> of &s;wearing; which was u&s;ually done here by lifting the hand, and not by laying it on the bible, as was the form in England. Was it a forced con&s;truction of the clau&s;e re&s;pecting lib|erty of con&s;cience, to &s;uppo&s;e, that this indulgence was granted to them? What other u&s;e could they have made of this liberty, than to act according to the dic|tates of their con&s;ciences? Is it then con|&s;i&s;tent with candor, to publi&s;h an a&s;&s;er|tion, &s;o worded as to admit the idea, that the&s;e gentlemen <HI>refu&s;ed</HI> to obey an e&s;&s;en|tial
<PB N="v" REF="023166_0004_0FBC76EDF70B0C98">
part of the duty pre&s;cribed by the commi&s;&s;ion, which they undertook to ex|ecute? Or is it con&s;i&s;tent with the charac|ter which he gives of the Pre&s;ident, CUTTS, p. 492, that
<Q>he was allowed to have been an hone&s;t man and a loyal &s;ubject?</Q>
The commi&s;&s;ion required them to take the oaths of allegiance and &s;upremacy, and an oath of office, which la&s;t is recited in the com|mi&s;&s;ion; but not a word is &s;aid of the mode and form, in which the oaths &s;hould be taken; neither was it &s;aid that they &s;hould be taken 'as the Engli&s;h law required.' They were therefore left at their liberty, to take them in any form which was agreeable to their con&s;cience, or their former u&s;age.</P>
<P>In the &s;ame page (491) he &s;ays;
<Q>An A&s;&s;embly was &s;oon called, which, by means of the u&s;ual intrigues, was com|po&s;ed of per&s;ons, extremely favorable to the projects of tho&s;e who now engro&s;&s;ed power.</Q>
And in a note (page 507)
<Q>the Council tran&s;mitted to the towns, a li&s;t of tho&s;e who &s;hould be allowed to vote.</Q></P>
<P>With what propriety can it be &s;aid that the&s;e gentlemen <HI>engro&s;&s;ed</HI> power, when they were commi&s;&s;ioned by the King;
<PB N="vi" REF="023166_0005_0FBC76EF796DC070">
and it is acknowledged, that not only their appointment, but their entering on office, was contrary to their inclinations?</P>
<P>That the per&s;ons cho&s;en into the A&s;|&s;embly &s;hould be 'favorable' to the &s;enti|ments of the Council, or of 'the wi&s;e men of Bo&s;ton,' was not the re&s;ult of any intrigues; but becau&s;e the majority of the people were of the &s;ame mind. As to &s;ending
<Q>a li&s;t of tho&s;e who &s;hould be allowed to vote;</Q>
the true &s;tate of the matter was this. The commi&s;&s;ion provid|ed for the calling of an A&s;&s;embly, within three months after the Council &s;hould be &s;worn, by &s;ummons under &s;eal,
<Q>u&s;ing and ob&s;erving therein &s;uch rules and methods, as to the per&s;ons who are to choo&s;e the deputies, and the time and place of meeting, as they (the Council) &s;hall judge mo&s;t convenient.</Q>
The mode which they judged mo&s;t convenient was, to order the &s;elect men of the four towns, to take a li&s;t of the names and e&s;tates of their re&s;pective inhabitants, according to their u&s;ual manner of making taxes, and &s;end it to the Council. The Council then i&s;&s;ued an order, appointing <HI>the per|&s;ons
<PB N="vii" REF="023166_0006_0FBC76F0F6CDF010">
therein named,</HI> to meet in their re&s;pec|tive towns, and elect by a major vote, three per&s;ons from each, to repre&s;ent them in a general A&s;&s;embly, on the 16th of March; and in the order, there is this provi&s;o,
<Q>Provided that wee do not intend that what is now done be pre&s;idential for the future, and that it &s;hall extend noe farther, than to the calling this fir&s;t a&s;&s;embly.</Q></P>
<P>Now as the rules and methods of call|ing an a&s;&s;embly, and the per&s;ons who were to choo&s;e deputies, were left to the di&s;|cretion of the Council; what more proper method could they have taken, than to call for a li&s;t of the inhabitants and their e&s;tates, and by that means to determine, who were qualified in point of property and habitancy to be electors? And as the numbers were few, and the per&s;ons well known, was it not as proper to name them at once, in the writs, as to e&s;tabli&s;h qualifications, and appoint other per&s;ons to judge of tho&s;e qualifications; e&s;pecially when there was no law in force by which they could be judged? It is ob&s;ervable that each voter was ordered to take the oath of al|legiance
<PB N="viii" REF="023166_0007_0FBC76F5854837F8">
if he had not taken it before; and in the li&s;t of names in the book, a mark is &s;et again&s;t &s;everal per&s;ons, who did not take the oath; and another again&s;t tho&s;e who did not appear at the election. Has this the appearance of <HI>intrigue?</HI></P>
<P>In page 492, he &s;ays,
<Q>they were ex|tremely &s;low in conforming to pre&s;ent requi&s;itions, and pa&s;&s;ed no laws during the fir&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion.</Q>
Having again con&s;ult|ed the records, I find in the Journal of the Council this entry,
<Q>At a general A&s;&s;em|bly held in Port&s;mouth, the 16th of March, 1679&mdash;80. Pre&s;ent, &amp;c. Sundry laws and ordinances made <HI>at this &s;e&s;&s;ion</HI> are in another booke, for that purpo&s;e.</Q></P>
<P>In that other book, a body of laws is recorded, in the &s;ame hand writ|ing, viz. of Stileman the Secretary, which bears the following title;
<Q>The general laws and liberties of the Province of New-Hamp&s;hire, made by the gene|ral A&s;&s;embly in Port&s;mouth, the 16th day of March, 1679&mdash;80, and approved by the Pre&s;ident and Council.</Q></P>
<P>It appears from the books, that this
<PB N="ix" REF="023166_0008_0FBC76F6F74E3400">
A&s;&s;embly held four &s;e&s;&s;ions within the year, viz. on the 16th of March, the 7th of June, the 12th of October, and the 7th of December. As there is not a particular date to each law, but the whole code bears the date of the fir&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion in March; it may fairly be inferred, that the bu&s;ine&s;s was begun in the fir&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion, and conti|nued through the other three; and when completed, was immediately &s;ent to Eng|land; for Mr. Chalmers him&s;elf tells us, that
<Q>the laws which they tran&s;mitted, in conformity to their Con&s;titution, had no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> good fortune to plea&s;e, and were di&s;app<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ved of, by the Lords of the Committee of Plantations, <HI>in Dec.</HI> 1681.</Q></P>
<P>From this &s;tatement it may be conclud|ed, that they were not &s;lower in
<Q>e&s;&s;aying their legi&s;lative talents,</Q>
than the nece&s;|&s;ity of proceeding with due deliberation re|quired; and that there was no ju&s;t cau&s;e for the reproach which he has ca&s;t upon them.</P>
<P>In page 494, he gives this account of the character of the people of New-Hamp&s;hire.
<Q>When CRANFIELD arrived, he found the Province containing four thou&s;and inhabitants, extremely poor
<PB N="x" REF="023166_0009_0FBC76F8810C8630">
from the deva&s;tation of the Indian war. But when he &s;poke contemptuou&s;ly of the country which he had been &s;ent to rule, he &s;eems not to have reflected, that all Colonies had once known the like paucity of numbers, the &s;ame weakne&s;s, and the &s;ame poverty; animated only by a <HI>di&s;&s;imilar &s;pirit</HI> from that of New-Hamp&s;hire, which now di&s;dained that <HI>independence on her neighbours,</HI> that other Provinces had contended for, with en|thu&s;ia&s;m. And other plantations, actu|ated by very different maxims, had not complained, even in their weake&s;t days, of their inability to defend their fron|tiers, again&s;t the attacks of a foe, that has never proved dangerous, except to the <HI>effeminate,</HI> the factious, or the <HI>cow|ardly.</HI> When New Plimouth con&s;i&s;ted only of two hundred per&s;ons, of all ages and &s;exes, it repul&s;ed its enemies and &s;e|cured its borders, with a gallantry wor|thy of its parent country; becau&s;e it &s;tood alone, in the de&s;ert, without hope of aid.</Q></P>
<P>That the people of New-Hamp&s;hire ever de&s;erved the character of <HI>effeminate</HI> or
<PB N="xi" REF="023166_0010_0FBC76FC0288ED00">
<HI>cowardly,</HI> can by no means be admitted. Innumerable facts evince the contrary beyond a doubt. Had this author ever re&s;ided among them, e&s;pecially in time of war, he would have thought quite other|wi&s;e of them. That the native &s;avages have
<Q>never proved a <HI>dangerous</HI> foe, to any but the effeminate, the factious and the cowardly,</Q>
is an a&s;&s;ertion totally un|founded. Their manner of attacking was always by &s;urpri&s;e, and the brave&s;t and be&s;t men may &s;ometimes be deficient in vigilance, where no &s;u&s;picion of danger exi&s;ts.</P>
<P>If the people of New-Hamp&s;hire
<Q>di&s;|dained independence,</Q>
let it be con&s;idered, that they had been, for about 40 years, con|nected with Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, to their mutual &s;atisfaction; and the propo&s;ed
<Q>indepen|dence</Q>
which he means was but another name for &s;ubjection to a landlord. When independence, in its genuine meaning, became nece&s;&s;ary, in 1776, they freely joined with their brethren in a&s;&s;erting it, and in bravely defending it.</P>
<P>Without any di&s;paragement to the fir&s;t &s;ettlers of Plymouth, who, from the year
<PB N="xii" REF="023166_0011_0FBC76FECBEA23F0">
1643, were protected by a confederacy of the four New-England Colonies, it may with truth be &s;aid, that the people of New-Hamp&s;hire were never behind them, in vigorous exertions for their own de|fence, when they were conducted by offi|cers in whom they could place confidence; but in Cranfield's time, there was no war with the Indians; though he attempted to frighten them into an apprehen&s;ion of danger, from the Indians, to &s;erve his own purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>The account which Mr. Chalmers gives of Cranfield's admini&s;tration differs not very materially from mine, except in one in&s;tance. He repre&s;ents
<Q>the mini&s;ters as very attentive to him, becau&s;e they deemed him gained over to the Independ|ents.</Q>
I have met with no evidence of this; the deception, if any, mu&s;t have been very &s;hort lived.</P>
<P>Mr. Chalmers &s;ays nothing of the pro&s;e|cution of Moody, and of Cranfield's en|deavours to ruin him, for his non-con|formity to the Church of England; but tells us that he
<Q>deemed it un&s;afe, to re|main any longer among the mini&s;ters,
<PB N="xiii" REF="023166_0012_0FBC77004D23CCD0">
who ruled an enthu&s;ia&s;tic people, with the &s;ame &s;way as did the popi&s;h clergy during the darke&s;t ages;</Q>
and that in his letters to England, he
<Q>gave warning, that while the clergy were allowed to preach, no true allegiance would be found in tho&s;e parts.</Q>
This may be con|&s;idered as a corroborating evidence of his bigotry and intolerance. Truth obliges me to add, that his opponents were not defici|ent in tho&s;e unhappy qualities, which were too much in fa&s;hion among all parties in that age.</P>
<P>Mr. Chalmers concludes his account of New-Hamp&s;hire in the&s;e words.
<Q>Being excluded from the charter granted to Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, it has continued to the pre&s;ent time, a different, though <HI>incon&s;id|erable</HI> &s;ettlement; irregular and factious in its economy, affording no precedents that may be of exemplary u&s;e to other Colonies.</Q>
What ju&s;tice there is in this remark, the reader will be able to deter|mine, from the following portion of its hi&s;tory, which, after much unavoidable delay, is now &s;ubmitted to his peru&s;al.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIII. The admini&s;tration of Governor <HI>SHUTE,</HI> and his Lieutenants, <HI>VAUGHAN</HI> and <HI>WENT|WORTH.</HI></HEAD>
<P>GEORGE VAUGHAN, E&s;q. was the &s;on of Major William Vaughan,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1715.</NOTE> who had been &s;o ill u&s;ed by former Gov|ernors, and had &s;uffered &s;o much in the cau&s;e of his country, that the advancement of his &s;on, to the office of Lieutenant Governor, was e&s;teemed a mark of particu|lar favor, from the Crown to the Prov|ince, and a &s;ingular gratification to the parent, then in the decline of life. The Lieutenant Governor had been employed by the Province, as their agent in England, to manage their defence again&s;t Allen. There he was taken notice of, by &s;ome per&s;ons of quality and influence, with whom his father had been connected; and by them he was recommended as a candidate for the honor to which he was now advanced.</P>
<P>After he had arrived, and opened his commi&s;&s;ion; Dudley,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Oct. 1&punc;</NOTE> though not actually

&s;uper&s;eded, yet daily expecting Burges to &s;ucceed him, did not think it proper to come into the Province, or perform any acts of government; &s;o that, during a year,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 8.</NOTE> Vaughan had the &s;ole command. In this time he called an A&s;&s;embly, who grant|ed him the product of the impo&s;t and ex|ci&s;e, for one year, but refu&s;ed to e&s;tabli&s;h the&s;e duties for any longer time; upon which he di&s;&s;olved them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1716.</NOTE> and called anoth|er;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Augu&s;t 21.</NOTE> to whom he recommended, in a &s;tyle too peremptory,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A&s;&s;embly Records.</NOTE> the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a perpetual revenue to the Crown; a matter in which he had been &s;o much engaged, that while in England,<NOTE PLACE="marg">MS letter of Sir W. A&s;hur&s;t to Dr. I. Mather.</NOTE>
<Q>he pre&s;ented a memorial to the King and Mini&s;try, to bring New-England into the land tax of Great Britain; and propo&s;ed that a Re|ceiver &s;hould be appointed by the Crown.</Q>
The A&s;&s;embly was of opinion, that the public charges might be defrayed in the u&s;ual manner, by an equal tax on polls and e&s;tates; and declined laying an im|po&s;t, or entering on any, but the common bu&s;ine&s;s of the year, till the arrival of a Governor.</P>

of whom were inhabitants of Port&s;mouth. That town, at the &s;ame time, was unhap|pily agitated by a controver&s;y, which had for &s;ome years &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between the two pari&s;hes. This had not only imbittered the minds of the people, but had preju|diced &s;ome of the members of the Coun|cil and A&s;&s;embly; &s;o as to affect the pro|ceedings of the Legi&s;lature, and break the harmony, which had been pre&s;erved in that body, during the preceding admini&s;tra|tion. The Governor, in his fir&s;t &s;peech to the A&s;&s;embly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1717.</NOTE> took notice of their divi|&s;ion, and advi&s;ed them to unanimity.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jan. 10.</NOTE> They thanked him for his advice, but re|mon&s;trated again&s;t the removal of the old Coun&s;ellors,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jan. 23.</NOTE> and the confining of the new appointments, both in the Council and the Judicial Courts, to re&s;idents in one town, as being contrary to former u&s;age, and giv|ing an advantage, to the trading, above the landed intere&s;t. This, they &s;aid, was the rea&s;on that an impo&s;t could not now be obtained, and that the whole burden of taxes was laid on the hu&s;bandman, and the laborer, who had been greatly impover|i&s;hed by the late war. The Governor wi&s;ely avoided an an&s;wer to this remon|&s;trance, by putting it on the Council, who
<PB N="20" REF="023166_0020_0FBC771079A30140">
were a party in the controver&s;y. The Council, in their an&s;wer, acknowledged that the Province had been much di&s;tre&s;&s;|ed by the war;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jan. 28.</NOTE> but had in a great mea&s;ure recovered; that there would have been no oppo&s;ition to an impo&s;t, if the Repre&s;en|tatives had agreed to an act of export, ac|cording to the practice in England; that the King had a right to appoint his Coun|&s;ellors, from any part of the Province; that it was an affront to the prerogative to find fault with the exerci&s;e of this right; and that it was mo&s;t convenient for the affairs of government, e&s;pecially upon &s;ud|den emergencies, that the Council &s;hould re&s;ide near the &s;eat of government. This an&s;wer might have appeared decent enough if they had not added, that they were
<Q>gen|tlemen of the be&s;t quality, and greate&s;t ability to &s;erve the government, in that &s;tation; and had as good or better e&s;tates in land, and land &s;ecurities, than any in the Hou&s;e, and not inferior to the gen|tlemen who were laid a&s;ide.</Q></P>
<P>While the&s;e altercations were in hand there was a great complaint of the &s;carci|ty of money, and &s;ome expedient was judged nece&s;&s;ary to &s;upply the place of current coin. A propo&s;al was made to i&s;|&s;ue
<PB N="21" REF="023166_0021_0FBC7711F5292D38">
ten thou&s;and pounds in bills, on loan, for twenty-three years, at five per cent. on land &s;ecurity. In this both Hou&s;es agreed;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jan. 24.</NOTE> but the next day the Council propo&s;ed to enlarge the &s;um to fifteen thou&s;and pounds, to which the Hou&s;e would not con&s;ent. The Governor then ordered the Hou&s;e to attend a conference with the Council; they de&s;ired to know on what &s;ubject; he gave them no an&s;wer, but commanded their attendance. Having conferred a|bout the propo&s;ed loan to no purpo&s;e, the circum&s;tance of a&s;king on what &s;ubject they were to confer was deemed an affront, and &s;erved as a pretext for di&s;&s;olving them.

<P>A controver&s;y al&s;o aro&s;e between the Governor and Lieutenant Governor about the power of the latter, in the ab&s;ence of the former. Vaughan contended, that when the Governor was pre&s;ent in his other Province, he was ab&s;ent from New-Hamp|&s;hire, and con&s;equently that the admini&s;|tration devolved on him. The po&s;ition was a metaphy&s;ical truth, but the infer|ence was to be mea&s;ured by political rules. Shute alleged that his commi&s;&s;ions, being
<PB N="22" REF="023166_0022_0FBC77156DDA5B88">
publi&s;hed and recorded, in New-Hamp|&s;hire and Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, he had the pow|er of commander in chief over both Pro|vinces, during his re&s;idence in either; and thought it an ab&s;urdity to &s;uppo&s;e, that the King had appointed the Gover|nor commander in chief, for five or &s;ix weeks only in the year, and the Lieutenant Governor during the re&s;t of the time; and that if the Lieutenant Governor &s;hould happen, in that time, to &s;tep over the Province line, the &s;enior Coun&s;ellor mu&s;t take the chair; this he &s;aid would make the Province 'a mon&s;ter with three heads.' The controver&s;y was &s;oon brought to an i&s;&s;ue; for Vaughan received an order from Shute, while at Bo&s;ton, to appoint a fa&s;t, which he did not obey; he received ano|ther to prorogue the A&s;&s;embly, in&s;tead of which he di&s;&s;olved them, without the ad|vice of Council. He required the opinion of the Council on the extent of his power, but they declined giving it. Penhallow, the Governor's chief friend, was a warm oppo&s;er of Vaughan's preten&s;ions, and in|curred &s;o much of his di&s;plea&s;ure, that he publicly charged him with &s;owing di&s;cord in the government,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sept. 24.</NOTE> and &s;u&s;pended him from his &s;eat in Council. On hearing this,
<PB N="23" REF="023166_0023_0FBC771740388C90">
Shute ha&s;ted to Port&s;mouth, and having &s;ummoned the Council, ordered the King's in&s;truction to him for &s;u&s;pending Coun&s;el|lors to be read, and demanded of Vaughan whether he had any in&s;truction which &s;u|per&s;eded it. He an&s;wered, No. The Gov|ernor then a&s;ked the Council's advice whether the &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of Penhallow was legal; they an&s;wered in the negative.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Council Minutes.</NOTE> He then re&s;tored him to his &s;eat, and &s;u&s;pend|ed Vaughan.</P>
<P>The A&s;&s;embly, which Vaughan had a&s;|&s;umed the right to di&s;&s;olve, met again, and approved the proceedings again&s;t him, ju&s;|tifying the con&s;truction which the Gover|nor had put on his commi&s;&s;ion, and his opinion of the extent of the Lieutenant Governor's power; which was
<Q>to ob&s;erve &s;uch orders, as he &s;hould from time to time receive from the King or the Gover|nor in chief.</Q>
The Repre&s;entatives of Hampton pre&s;ented a remon&s;trance; in which, admitting the Lieutenant Gover|nor's opinion that
<Q>when the Governor is out of the Province, the Lieutenant Gov|ernor is impowered to execute the King's commi&s;&s;ion,</Q>
and a&s;&s;erting that the Gov|ernor was not in the Province when the Lieutenant Governor di&s;&s;olved the A&s;&s;em|bly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A&s;&s;embly Records.</NOTE>

they declared that they could not act with the Hou&s;e, unle&s;s they were re-elect|ed. This remon&s;trance was deemed a libel, and the Governor in Council having &s;ummoned them before him, laid them un|der bonds of four hundred pounds each, for their good behaviour.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Council Minutes.</NOTE> He then i&s;&s;u|ed a proclamation, a&s;&s;erting his &s;ole pow|er, as commander in chief; and declaring that the Lieutenant Governor had no right to exerci&s;e any acts of government with|out his &s;pecial order.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Penhal|low's MSS.</NOTE></P>
<P>To maintain a controver&s;y with a &s;upe|rior officer on the extent of power, equal|ly claimed by both, requires a delicacy and addre&s;s which does not fall to the lot of every man. An a&s;piring and precipitate temper may bring on &s;uch a contention, but di&s;qualifies the per&s;on from managing it with propriety. Had Vaughan propo&s;|ed to &s;ubmit the que&s;tion to the King, he would have acted more in character, and might have pre&s;erved his reputation, though he had lo&s;t his power. But hav|ing offended the Governor, and di&s;gu&s;ted the Council and A&s;&s;embly, he could hope for no favor from the Crown. When the report of the proceedings was &s;ent to Eng|land, Sir William A&s;hur&s;t, who had great

<P>John Wentworth, E&s;q. grand&s;on of William Wentworth, formerly mention|ed as one of the fir&s;t &s;ettlers of the country, had been in the early part of his life, commander of a &s;hip; and had acquir|ed a hand&s;ome fortune by mercantile in|du&s;try. Without any &s;uperior abilities or learning, by a &s;teady attention to bu&s;ine&s;s, and a prudent obliging deportment, he had recommended him&s;elf to the e&s;teem of the people. Having been five years in the Council, before his appointment as Lieu|tenant Governor, he had carried the &s;ame u&s;eful qualities into public life, and pre|&s;erved or increa&s;ed that re&s;pect which he had acquired in a private &s;tation.

a nece&s;&s;ary character in a chief magi&s;trate; and the circum&s;tances of the Province, at that time, required a per&s;on of experience in trade, at its head.</P>
<P>It being a time of peace, after a long and di&s;tre&s;&s;ing war, the improvement of which the Province was capable, in regard to its natural productions, lumber and na|val &s;tores, ro&s;e into view and became ob|jects of clo&s;e attention both here and in England. As early as 1668, the govern|ment of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ma&s;&s;. Rec.</NOTE> under which the Province then was, had re&s;erved for the public u&s;e all white pine trees of twenty-four inches in diameter, at three feet from the ground. In King William's reign, a &s;urveyor of the woods was appointed by the Crown;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Council Minutes.</NOTE> and an order was &s;ent to the Earl of Bellamont, to cau&s;e acts to be pa&s;|&s;ed in his &s;everal governments for the pre|&s;ervation of the white pines. In 1708 a law made in New-Hamp&s;hire prohibited the cutting of &s;uch as were twenty-four inches in diameter,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Laws Chap. 20.</NOTE> at twelve inches from the ground, without leave of the &s;urvey|or; who was in&s;tructed by the Queen, to mark with the broad arrow, tho&s;e which were or might be fit for the u&s;e of the na|vy, and to keep a regi&s;ter of them. What|ever

&s;everity might be u&s;ed in executing the law, it was no difficult matter for tho&s;e who knew the woods and were concerned in lumber, to evade it; though &s;ometimes they were detected and fined. Great com|plaints were frequently made of the de|&s;truction of the royal woods;<NOTE PLACE="marg">U&s;her's MSS.</NOTE> every Gov|ernor and Lieutenant Governor had oc|ca&s;ion to declaim on the &s;ubject in their &s;peeches and letters;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Council &amp; A&s;&s;embly Records.</NOTE> it was a favorite point in England, and recommended them to their &s;uperiors as careful guardians of the royal intere&s;t. On the other hand, the people made as loud complaints again&s;t the &s;urveyor, for prohibiting the cutting of pine trees, and yet neglecting to mark &s;uch as were fit for ma&s;ts; by which means many trees, which never could be u&s;ed as ma&s;ts, and might be cut into logs for &s;awing, were rotting in the woods;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Penhal|low's MSS.</NOTE> or the people who got them were expo&s;ed to a vexatious pro&s;ecution. When no &s;urveyor was on the &s;pot, the Governor and Council appointed &s;uitable per&s;ons to take care that no wa&s;te &s;hould be made of the ma&s;t trees; and the&s;e officers, with a very moderate allowance, performed the duty, to much better purpo&s;e, than tho&s;e who were &s;ent from England and main|tained at a great expen&s;e to the Crown.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A&s;&s;embly Records.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="023166_0028_0FBC7721E0E7A520"><NOTE PLACE="marg">1718.</NOTE>As tho&s;e trees which grew within the limits of the town&s;hips were deemed pri|vate property, the people were de&s;irous to get other town&s;hips laid out, that the trees might be &s;ecured for their own u&s;e. This was a difficult point. The A&s;&s;embly, in 1704, during the controver&s;y with Allen, had explicitly di&s;claimed all title to the wa&s;te lands, by which they under&s;tood all tho&s;e without the bounds of their towns.

The royal determina|tion could not be had, but on an appeal from a verdict at law; but no &s;uits were now pending; nor could the lands be granted by royal charter, without &s;eem|ing to intrench on the property of the claimants.

<P>Great quantities of iron ore were found in many places;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1719.</NOTE> and it was in contem|plation to erect forges on &s;ome of the riv|ers, and to introduce foreign arti&s;ts and laborers to refine it. A law was made laying a penalty of ten pounds per ton,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Laws Chap. 90.</NOTE> on the tran&s;porting of it out of the province; but for the further encouragement of the man|ufacture, it was deemed nece&s;&s;ary, that &s;ome lands &s;hould be appropriated, to the pur|po&s;e of &s;upplying with fewel, the iron works which were to be erected,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Council Minutes.</NOTE> on Lam|prey river, and of &s;ettling the people who were to be employed in that &s;ervice.

Upon this, a pe|tition was pre&s;ented to the Governor and Council praying for a fulfilment of this promi&s;e; and after &s;ome he&s;itation, a grant was made of a &s;lip of land two miles in breadth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Council Minutes.</NOTE> above the head line of Dover, for the u&s;e of the iron works, which was called the

<P>In &s;ome parts of the Province, were many pitch pine trees, unfit for ma&s;ts, but capable of yielding tar and turpentine. A monopoly of this manufacture had been attempted by a company of merchants; but when many thou&s;and trees were pre|pared for u&s;e they were de&s;troyed by un|known hands.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Council Minutes.</NOTE> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Laws.

<P>Hemp was another object. Some had been &s;own, and from the &s;pecimen of its growth, much advantage was expected.

<P>The Parliament of England was atten|tive to the advantages which might be de|rived to the nation from the Colonies, to which they were particularly incited by the war, which at this time raged between Sweden and Ru&s;&s;ia, the grand marts for naval &s;tores in Europe.

the &s;hare he had in obtaining it. About the &s;ame time, an act of Parliament was made for the pre&s;ervation of the white pines. Penalties in proportion to the &s;ize of the trees, were laid on the cutting of tho&s;e which grew without the bounds of town&s;hips; and for the greater terror, the&s;e penalties were to be recovered by the oath of one witne&s;s, in a court of Admi|ralty; where a &s;ingle Judge, appointed by the Crown, and removeable at plea&s;ure, determined the cau&s;e without a Jury.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Statute of George I.

<P>While the&s;e things were in agitation, the Province unexpectedly received an ac|ce&s;&s;ion of inhabitants from the north of Ireland.

<P>As &s;oon as the &s;pring opened, the men went from Haverhill, where they left their families,<NOTE PLACE="marg">April 11.</NOTE> and built &s;ome huts near a brook which falls into Beaver River, and which they named We&s;t-running brook.

which is to this day regarded with a degree of veneration. As &s;oon as they could col|lect their families, they called Macgregore to be their mini&s;ter, who &s;ince his arrival in the country had preached at Dracut. At the fir&s;t &s;acramental occa&s;ion, were pre&s;ent two mini&s;ters and &s;ixty-five com|municants.

The&s;e people brought with them the nece&s;&s;ary materials for the manufacture of linen; and their &s;pinning wheels, turned by the foot, were a novelty in the country. They al&s;o introduced the culture of potatoes, which were fir&s;t planted in the garden of Nathaniel Walker of Andover. They were an indu&s;trious, frugal and con&s;e|quently thriving people.</P>
<P>They met with &s;ome difficulty in ob|taining a title to their lands. If the due we&s;t line between the Provinces had been e&s;tabli&s;hed, it would have pa&s;&s;ed through their &s;ettlement and divided it between Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts and New-Hamp&s;hire&punc; but the curve line, following the cour&s;e of Merrimack at three miles di&s;tance, would leave them unque&s;tionably in New-Hamp|&s;hire.

This was the idea of the General Court of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, who, upon appli|cation to them for a confirmation of their former grant, declared them to be out of their juri&s;diction. Among the many claimants to the&s;e lands, they were inform|ed, that Col. Wheelwright of Wells had the be&s;t Indian title, derived from his an|ce&s;tors. Suppo&s;ing this to be valid in a moral view, they followed the example of the fir&s;t &s;ettlers of New-England, and ob|tained a deed of ten miles &s;quare, in virtue of the general licen&s;e granted by the In|dian Sagamores in 1629. To prevent dif|ficulty from Allen's claim, they applied for leave of &s;ettlement to Col.

They al&s;o applied to the Lieutenant Governor of New-Hamp&s;hire, who declined making them a grant in the King's name; but, by advice of Council, gave them a protection, and extended the benefit of the law to them; appointing James McKean to be a Ju&s;tice of the Peace,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Council Minutes.</NOTE> and Robert Wier a Deputy Sheriff.</P>

<P>This, with &s;everal other circum&s;tances relating to the&s;e people, I took from a manu&s;cript letter written (1729) by Mr. John Harvey, &s;chool|ma&s;ter in Londonderry, to Mr. Prince. In the &s;ame letter was the fol|lowing brief account of the &s;eige above mentioned.
<Q>Londonderry was be&s;ieged near half a year (1689) by King James's army, when he had all Ireland &s;ubdued but Derry and a little place hard by. The be&s;ieged defended the city, mo&s;t of them being pre&s;byterians, till they were very much pinched by famine, that a dog's head was &s;old cheap enough at half a crown; and yet God &s;upported them until King Wil|liam &s;ent them relief by two &s;hips with men and provi&s;ions from Eng|land; at which fight, before the &s;hips got up to the city and landed their men, the be&s;iegers moved their camp and fled to the we&s;t of Ire|land, where afterwards two bloody battles were fought and the papi&s;ts &s;ubdued.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Two things further (&s;ays he) I have to relate re&s;pecting Derry, 1. The church of Derry i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;o &s;trongly built with &s;tone and lime that in the &s;teeple they had a cannon fixed, which did more hurt to the Iri&s;h army than &s;ix upon the walls. 2. There was one Col. Murray in the &s;iege. He and a party were out again&s;t the enemy, and having got the advan|tage in an engagement with them a mile from the walls, the enemy's General, who was a Frenchman, and he, met; and having both fired their pi&s;tols, drew their &s;words, and the General having a coat of mail, had the advantage of Murray, &s;o that he could not hurt him. At length Murray ob&s;erving that there was no touching him but through the harne&s;s in his face, put his &s;word in through the bars of the harne&s;s and killed him. They made a great &s;laughter that day.</Q></P>
<P>Nothing was more offen&s;ive to the&s;e emigrants than to be called IRISH. Macgregore in a letter to Governor Shute, (1720) &s;ays:
<Q>We are &s;ur|pri&s;ed to hear our&s;elves termed Iri&s;h people, when we &s;o frequently ventured our all for the Briti&s;h Crown and liberties again&s;t the Iri&s;h papi&s;ts; and gave all te&s;ts of our loyalty, which the government of Ireland required, and are always ready to do the &s;ame when demanded.</Q></P>
<P>The people of this country did not under&s;tand the di&s;tinction; nor in fact did they treat the&s;e &s;trangers with common decency on their fir&s;t arrival. The grudge &s;ub&s;i&s;ted a long time, but is now worn out.</P></NOTE></P>
<P>The &s;ettlement of the&s;e emigrants, on the wa&s;te lands, opened the way for other plantations. Tho&s;e who had borne the burthens and di&s;tre&s;&s;es of war, in defend|ing

the country, had long been circum|&s;cribed within the limits of the old towns; but were now multiplied, and required room to make &s;ettlements for their chil|dren. They thought it hard to be exclud|ed from the privelege of cultivating the lands, which they and their fathers had defended; while &s;trangers were admitted to &s;it down peaceably upon them. The&s;e were weighty rea&s;ons. At the &s;ame time no attempt was making, by any of the claimants, to determine the long conte&s;t|ed point of property; and in fact, no per|&s;on could give a clear and undi&s;puted title to any of the un&s;ettled lands.</P>
<P>In the&s;e circum&s;tances, a company of about one hundred per&s;ons, inhabitants of Port&s;mouth, Exeter and Haverhill, pe|titioned for liberty to begin a plantation, on the northerly part of the lands called Nutfield.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1721.</NOTE> The&s;e were &s;oon followed by petitioners from the other towns, for the lands which lay contiguous to them.

Governor and Council kept the petitions &s;u&s;pended for a long time, giving public notice to all per&s;ons concerned to make their objections.

Some of the&s;e lands were well &s;tocked with pine trees; which were felled in great abun|dance; this occa&s;ioned a fre&s;h complaint from the King's &s;urveyor.</P>
<P>At length, charters being prepared, were &s;igned by the Governor;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1722.</NOTE> by which four town&s;hips, Che&s;ter, Nottingham,<NOTE PLACE="marg">May 10.</NOTE> Barring|ton and Roche&s;ter were granted and in|corporated.

<P><PB N="42" REF="023166_0042_0FBC774074D13D80">The &s;igning of the&s;e grants was the la&s;t act of Government performed by Shute in New-Hamp&s;hire.

<HEAD>CHAP. XIV. The fourth Indian War, commonly called the three years war, or <HI>LOVEWELL'S</HI> war.</HEAD>
<P>TO account for the frequent wars with the ea&s;tern Indians, u&s;ually called by the French, the Abenaquis, and their un&s;teadine&s;s both in war and peace; we mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that they were &s;ituated between the Colonies of two European na|tions, who were often at war with each other, and who pur&s;ued very different mea&s;ures with regard to them.</P>
<P>As the lands, on which they lived, were comprehended in the patents granted by the crown of England, the natives were con&s;idered by the Engli&s;h, as &s;ubjects of that crown. In the treaties and conferen|ces held with them, they were &s;tyled the King's &s;ubjects; when war was declared again&s;t them, they were called rebels; and when they were compelled to make peace, they &s;ub&s;cribed an acknowledgement of their perfidy, and a declaration of their &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the government, without any ju&s;t ideas of the meaning of tho&s;e
<PB N="44" REF="023166_0044_0FBC7743231838F0">
terms; and it is a difficult point, to deter|mine what kind of &s;ubjects they were.</P>
<P>Be&s;ide the patents, derived from the Crown, the Engli&s;h in general were fond of obtaining from the Indians, deeds of &s;ale for tho&s;e lands, on which they were di&s;po&s;ed to make &s;ettlements. Some of the&s;e deeds were executed with legal for|mality, and a valuable con&s;ideration was paid to the natives for the purcha&s;e; oth|ers were of ob&s;cure and uncertain original; but the memory of &s;uch tran&s;actions was &s;oon lo&s;t, among a people who had no written records. Lands had been purcha&s;|ed of the Indian chiefs, on the Rivers Kennebeck and St. George, at an early pe|riod; but the &s;ucceeding Indians either had no knowledge of the &s;ales made by their ance&s;tors, or had an idea that &s;uch bargains were not binding on po&s;terity; who had as much need of the lands, and could u&s;e them to the &s;ame purpo&s;e as their fathers. At fir&s;t, the Indians did not know that the European manner of cul|tivating lands, and erecting mills and dams, would drive away the game and fi&s;h, and thereby deprive them of the means of &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence; afterward, finding by experience that this was the con&s;equence of admit|ting foreigners to &s;ettle among them, they
<PB N="45" REF="023166_0045_0FBC7744365587D8">
repented of their ho&s;pitality, and were in|clined to di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s their new neighbours, as the only way of re&s;toring the country to its pri&s;tine &s;tate, and of recovering their u&s;ual mode of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence.</P>
<P>They were extremely offended by the &s;ettlements, which the Engli&s;h, after the peace of Utrecht, made on the lands at the ea&s;tward, and by their building forts, block hou&s;es and mills; whereby their u&s;ual mode of pa&s;&s;ing the rivers and car|rying-places was interrupted; and they could not believe, though they were told with great &s;olemnity,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Governor Shute's conference 1717.</NOTE> that the&s;e fortifica|tions were erected for <HI>their</HI> defence again&s;t inva&s;ion. When conferences were held with them on this &s;ubject, they either de|nied that the lands had been &s;old, or pre|tended that the Sachems had exceeded their power in making the bargains;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Waldo's defence of Loveret's title.</NOTE> or had conveyed lands beyond the limits of their tribe; or that the Engli&s;h had taken advantage of their drunkenne&s;s to make them &s;ign the deeds; or that no valuable con&s;ideration had been given for the pur|cha&s;e. No arguments or evidence which could be adduced would &s;atisfy them, un|le&s;s the lands were paid for again; and had this been done once, their po&s;terity after a few years would have renewed the demand.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="023166_0046_0FBC7747F99B6BD8">On the other hand, the French did not in a formal manner declare them &s;ubjects of the crown of France;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Abbe Raynal.</NOTE> but every tribe, how|ever &s;mall, was allowed to pre&s;erve its in|dependence. Tho&s;e who were &s;ituated in the heart of Canada kept their lands to them&s;elves, which were never &s;olicited from them; tho&s;e who dwelt on the riv|ers and &s;hores of the Atlantic, though di&s;tant from the French Colonies, receiv|ed annual pre&s;ents from the King of France; and &s;olitary traders re&s;ided with, or occa&s;ionally vi&s;ited them; but no at|tempt was made by any company to &s;et|tle on their lands.</P>
<P>It was in the power of the Engli&s;h to &s;upply them with provi&s;ions, arms, am|munition, blankets and other articles which they wanted, cheaper than they could purcha&s;e them of the French. Gov|ernor Shute had promi&s;ed that trading hou&s;es &s;hould be e&s;tabli&s;hed among them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1717.</NOTE> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The reader is de&s;ired to correct a mi&s;take in the fir&s;t volume, page 358, line 5, in&s;tead of 'truck hou&s;es e&s;tabli&s;hed,' read 'it was in con|templation to e&s;tabli&s;h truck hou&s;es.'</NOTE> and that a &s;mith &s;hould be provided to keep their arms and other in&s;truments in repair; but the unhappy contentions be|tween the Governor and A&s;&s;embly of Ma&s;|&s;achu&s;etts prevented a compliance with this engagement. The Indians were there|fore

obliged to &s;ubmit to the impo&s;itions of private traders, or to &s;eek &s;upplies from the French; who failed not to join with them in reproaching the Engli&s;h for this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> of promi&s;e, and for their avidity in getting away the land.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of the ea&s;tern parts of New-England were not of the be&s;t cha|racter for religion, and were ill adapted to engage the affections of the Indians by their example. The frequent ho&s;tilities on this quarter, not only kept alive a &s;pi|rit of jealou&s;y and revenge in individuals, but prevented any endeavors to propagate religious knowledge among the Indians by the government; though it was one of the conditions of their charter; and though many good men wi&s;hed it might be attempted. At length Governor Shute, in his conference with their Sachems at Arrow&s;ic, introduced this important bu&s;i|ne&s;s by offering them in a formal manner, an Indian bible, and a prote&s;tant mi&s;&s;ion|ary; but they rejected both, &s;aying

He even made the offices of devotion &s;erve as incentives to their ferocity, and kept a flag, in which was depicted a cro&s;s, &s;urrounded by bows and arrows, which he u&s;ed to hoi&s;t on a pole, at the door of his church, when he gave them ab&s;olution,<NOTE PLACE="marg">New Eng|land Cou|r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nt, No. 160.</NOTE> previou&s;ly to their engaging in any warlike enterpri&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="023166_0049_0FBC774C9794CDE0">With this Je&s;uit, the Governor of Can|ada held a clo&s;e corre&s;pondence; and by him was informed of every thing tran&s;|acted among the Indians. By this means, their di&s;content with the Engli&s;h, on ac|count of the &s;ettlements made at the ea&s;t|ward, was heightened and inflamed; and they received every encouragement, to a&s;|&s;ert their title to the lands in que&s;tion, and mole&s;t the &s;ettlers, by killing their cattle, burning their &s;tacks of hay, robbing and in&s;ulting them. The&s;e in&s;olencies di&s;cour|aged the people,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1720.</NOTE> and cau&s;ed many of them to remove. The garri&s;ons were then re|inforced; and &s;couting parties were order|ed into the ea&s;tern quarter, under the com|mand of Col. Shadrach Walton. By this appearance of force, the Indians, who dreaded the power of the Engli&s;h, were re|&s;trained from open ho&s;tilities. They had frequent parleys with the commanders of forts, and with commi&s;&s;ioners who vi&s;ited them occa&s;ionally; and though at fir&s;t they &s;eemed to be re&s;olute in demanding the removal of the Engli&s;h, declaring that
<Q>they had fought for the land three times, and would fight for it again;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Captain Penhal|low's MSS.</NOTE></Q>
yet when they were told that there was no alterna|tive but perfect peace or open war, and that if they cho&s;e peace they mu&s;t forbear

every kind of in&s;ult, they &s;eemed to prefer peace; and either pretended ignorance of what had been done, or promi&s;ed to make inquiry into it; and as an evidence of their good intentions, offered a tribute of &s;kins, and delivered up four of their young men as ho&s;tages.</P>
<P>This proceeding was highly di&s;reli&s;hed by the Governor of Canada; who renew|ed his efforts to keep up the quarrel, and &s;ecretly promi&s;ed to &s;upply the Indians with arms and ammunition; though as it was a time of peace between the two crowns,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hutchin|&s;on II. 263.</NOTE> he could not openly a&s;&s;i&s;t them.</P>
<P>The New-England governments; though highly incen&s;ed, were not ea&s;ily per&s;uaded to con&s;ent to a war. The di&s;pute was be|tween the Indians and the proprietors of the ea&s;tern lands, in which the public were not directly intere&s;ted. No blood had as yet been &s;hed. Can&s;eau had been &s;urpri&s;ed and plundered, and &s;ome people killed there; but that was in the govern|ment of Nova-Scotia. Rall&egrave; was regard|ed as the principal in&s;tigator of the Indi|ans; and it was thought, that if he could be taken off they would be quiet. It was once propo&s;ed to &s;end the Sheriff of York County with a po&s;&s;e of one hundred and
<PB N="51" REF="023166_0051_0FBC774F79F864A0">
fifty men,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1721.</NOTE> to &s;eize and bring him to Bo&s;|ton; but this was not agreed to. The next &s;ummer, Rall&egrave; in company with Ca&s;|tine from Penob&s;cot, and Croi&s;il from Canada, appeared among the Indians, at a conference held on Arrow&s;ic I&s;land,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July.</NOTE> with Capt. Penhallow, the commander of the garri&s;on, and brought a letter, written in the name of the &s;everal tribes of Indians, directed to Governor Shute; in which it was declared,
<Q>that if the Engli&s;h did not remove in three weeks, they would kill them and their cattle, and burn their hou&s;es.</Q>
An additional guard was &s;ent down; but the government, loth to come to a rupture, and de&s;irous if po&s;&s;ible to treat with the Indians &s;eparately from the French emi&s;&s;aries, invited them to another conference, which invitation they treated with neglect.</P>
<P>In the &s;ucceeding winter, a party under Col. Thomas We&s;tbrooke was ordered to Noridgwog to &s;eize Rall&egrave;. They arrived at the village undi&s;covered, but before they could &s;urround his hou&s;e, he e&s;caped into the woods, leaving his papers in his &s;trong box, which they brought off without do|ing any other damage. Among the&s;e pa|pers were his letters of corre&s;pondence with the Governor of Canada, by which
<PB N="52" REF="023166_0052_0FBC775284E5B920">

<P>This attempt to &s;eize their &s;piritual father, could not long be unrevenged.

were of the Council. A declaration of war being made, the enemy were expected on every part of the frontiers; and the A&s;&s;embly were obliged to concert mea&s;ures for their &s;ecurity, after an interval of peace for about ten years.</P>
<P>The u&s;ual route of the Indians, in their marches to the frontiers of New-Hamp|&s;hire, was by the way of Winipi&s;eogee lake. The di&s;tance from Cochecho falls in the town of Dover, to the &s;outhea&s;t bay of that lake, is about thirty miles. It was thought that if a road could be opened to that place, and a fort built there, the ene|my would be prevented from coming that way. Orders were accordingly i&s;&s;ued, and a party of two hundred and fifty men were employed in cutting down the woods for a road; but the expen&s;e &s;o far exceed|ed the benefit which could be expected from a fort at &s;uch a di&s;tance, in the wil|derne&s;s, to be &s;upplied with provi&s;ions and ammunition by land carriage, which might ea&s;ily be interrupted by the enemy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A&s;&s;embly Records.</NOTE> that the de&s;ign was laid a&s;ide, and the old method of defence by &s;couts and garri|&s;ons was adopted. Lieutenant Governor Wentworth, being Commander in Chief in Shute's ab&s;ence, was particularly careful to &s;upply the garri&s;ons with &s;tores, and vi&s;it

them in per&s;on, to &s;ee that the duty was regularly performed; for which, and oth|er prudent and faithful &s;ervices, he fre|quently received the acknowledgments of the A&s;&s;embly and grants of money, gene|rally amounting to one hundred pounds at every &s;e&s;&s;ion, and &s;ometimes more. They al&s;o took care to inli&s;t men for two years, and to e&s;tabli&s;h the wages of offi|cers and &s;oldiers at the following rates; a Captain, at &s;even pounds per month; a Lieutenant, four pounds; a Sergeant, fif|ty-eight &s;hillings; a Corporal, forty-five &s;hillings, and a private, forty &s;hillings. A bounty of one hundred pounds was offer|ed for every Indian &s;calp. The difference between the currency and &s;terling, was two and an half for one.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t appearance of the enemy in New-Hamp&s;hire,<NOTE PLACE="marg">723.</NOTE> was at Dover; where they &s;urpri&s;ed and killed Jo&s;eph Ham, and took three of his children; the re&s;t of the family e&s;caped to the garri&s;on. Soon af|ter they waylaid the road,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Penhallow page 96.</NOTE> and killed Tri&s;|tram Heard. Their next on&s;et was at Lamprey River, where they killed Aaron Rawlins and one of his children,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Augu&s;t 29.</NOTE> taking his wife and three children captive.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P><Q>This Aaron Rawlins (who&s;e wife was a daughter of Edward Tay|lor, who was killed by the Indians 1704) lived upon the plantation left by Taylor, about half a mile we&s;t from Lamprey River landing, at the lower falls on Pi&s;ca&s;ick River. The people there at that time, commonly retired, at night, to the garri&s;oned hou&s;es, and returned home in the day time; but that night they neglected to retire as u&s;ual. His brother Samuel al&s;o lived about half a mile di&s;tant on the &s;ame river. It &s;eems the Indian &s;cout con&s;i&s;ted of eighteen, who probably had been reconnoitering &s;ome time&punc; and intended to have de&s;troyed both the families, and for that purpo&s;e divided, and nine went to each hou&s;e; but the party that went to Samuel Rawlins's, beating in the window, and finding the family gone, immediately joined their com|panions, who were engaged at Aaron's. His wife went out at the door, perhaps &s;ooner than they would otherwi&s;e have a&s;&s;aulted the hou&s;e, and was immediately &s;eized, and one or two of her children who fol|lowed her. Her hu&s;band being alarmed, &s;ecured the door before they could enter, and with his elde&s;t daughter, about twelve years old, &s;tood upon his defence, repeatedly firing wherever they attempted to enter, and at the &s;ame time calling earne&s;tly to his neighbors for help; but the people in the &s;everal garri&s;oned hou&s;es near, apprehending from the noi&s;e and ince&s;&s;ant firing, the number of the enemy to be greater than they were, and expecting every moment to be attacked them&s;elves, did not venture to come to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Having for &s;ome time bravely with&s;tood &s;uch unequal force, he was at la&s;t killed by their random &s;hots through the hou&s;e, which they then broke open, and kil|led his daughter. They &s;calped him, and cut off his daughter's head, either through ha&s;te, or probably being enraged again&s;t her, on account of the a&s;&s;i&s;tance &s;he had afforded her father in their defence, which ev|idently appeared by her hands being &s;oiled with powder. His wife and two children, a &s;on and a daughter, they carried to Canada: The woman was redeemed in a few years. The &s;on was adopted by the In|dians, and lived with them all his days; he came into Pennycook with the Indians after the peace, and expre&s;&s;ed to &s;ome people with whom he conver&s;ed, much re&s;entment again&s;t his uncle Samuel Raw|lins, on &s;uppo&s;ing he had detained from his mother &s;ome property left by his father, but manife&s;ted no de&s;ire of returning to Newmarket again. The daughter married with a Frenchman, and when &s;he was near &s;ixty years old, returned with her hu&s;band to her native place, in expectation of recovering the patrimony &s;he conceived was left at the deat hof her father: But the e&s;tate having been &s;old by her grandfath|er Taylor's admini&s;trator, they were di&s;appointed, and after a year or two went back to Canada.</Q></P>

The people being alarmed, went in pur&s;uit; but the Indians cauti|ou&s;ly avoiding all paths, went off with their captives undi&s;covered.

The Indian who had &s;tood on the point, and was returning to the vil|lage, by another path, met them, and re|ceived their fire, which he returned, and wounded Lovewell and another with &s;mall &s;hot.

made a prudent u&s;e of their advantage, the whole company mu&s;t either have been killed, or obliged to &s;urrender at di&s;cretion; being de&s;titute of a mouthful of &s;u&s;te|nance and an e&s;cape being impracticable. Under the conduct of Lieutenant Wyman they kept up their fire, and &s;hewed a re&s;o|lute countenance, all the remainder of the day; during which their chaplain, Jona|than Frie, En&s;ign Robbins, and one more, were mortally wounded. The Indians in|vited them to &s;urrender, by holding up ropes to them, and endeavored to intimi|date them by their hideous yells; but they determined to die rather than yield; and by their well directed fire, the number of the &s;avages was thinned, and their cries became fainter, till, ju&s;t before night, they quitted their advantageous ground, carry|ing off their killed and wounded, and leav|ing the dead bodies of Lovewell and his men un&s;calped. The &s;hattered remnant of this brave company, collecting them|&s;elves together, found three of their num|ber unable to move from the &s;pot, eleven wounded but able to march, and nine who had received no hurt. It was mel|ancholy to leave their dying companions behind, but there was no po&s;&s;ibility of re|moving them. One of them, en&s;ign Rob|bins,

de&s;ired them to lay his gun by him charged, that if the Indians &s;hould return before his death he might be able to kill one more. After the ri&s;ing of the moon, they quitted the fatal &s;pot, and directed their march toward the fort, where the &s;urgeon and guard had been left. To their great &s;urpri&s;e they found it de&s;erted. In the beginning of the action, one man (who&s;e name has not been thought worthy to be tran&s;mitted to po&s;terity) quitted the field, and fled to the fort; where, in the &s;tyle of Job's me&s;&s;engers, he informed them of Lovewell's death, and the defeat of the whole company; upon which they made the be&s;t of their way home; leaving a quantity of bread and pork, which was a &s;ea&s;onable relief to the retreating &s;urviv|ors. From this place, they endeavored to get home. Lieutenant Farwell and the chaplain, who had the journal of the march in his pocket, and one more, per|i&s;hed in the woods, for want of dre&s;&s;ing for their wounds. The others, after en|during the mo&s;t &s;evere hard&s;hips, came in one after another, and were not only re|ceived with joy, but were recompen&s;ed for their valor, and &s;ufferings; and a gener|ous provi&s;ion was made for the widows and children of the &s;lain.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="023166_0069_0FBC77739C366980">A party from the frontiers of New-Hamp&s;hire, were ordered out to bury the dead; but by &s;ome mi&s;take did not reach the place of action. Colonel Tyng, with a company from Dun&s;table, went to the &s;pot, and having found the bodies of twelve, buried them, and carved their names on the trees where the battle was fought. At a little di&s;tance he found three Indian graves, which he opened; one of the bodies was known to be their warrior Paugus. He al&s;o ob&s;erved tracks of blood, on the ground, to a great di&s;t|ance from the &s;cene of action. It was re|marked that a week before this engage|ment happened,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Penhal|low's Indi|an wars.</NOTE> it had been reported in Port&s;mouth, at the di&s;tance of eighty miles, with but little variation from the truth.

<P>This was one of the mo&s;t fierce and ob|&s;tinate battles which had been fought with the Indians. They had not only the advantage of numbers, but of placing them&s;elves in ambu&s;h, and waiting with deliberation the moment of attack. The&s;e circum&s;tances gave them a degree of ardor

and impetuo&s;ity. Lovewell and his men, though di&s;appointed of meeting the ene|my in their front, expected and determin|ed to fight. The fall of their commander, and more than one quarter of their number, in the fir&s;t on&s;et, was greatly di&s;couraging; but they knew that the &s;ituation to which they were reduced, and their di&s;tance from the frontiers, cut off all hope of &s;afety from flight. In the&s;e circum&s;tances, prudence as well as valor dictated a continuance of the engagement, and a refu&s;al to &s;urrender; until the enemy, awed by their brave re|&s;i&s;tance, and weakened by their own lo&s;s, yielded them the honor of the field.

<P>The conduct of the Marquis de Van|dreuil, Governor of Canada, was &s;o flag|rant a breach of the treaty of peace, &s;ub|&s;i&s;ting between the Crowns of England and France, that it was thought, a &s;pirit|ed remon&s;trance might make him a&s;ham|ed, and produce &s;ome beneficial effects. With this view, the General Court of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets propo&s;ed to the Colonies of

New-York, Connecticut, Rhode-I&s;land and New-Hamp&s;hire, to join in &s;ending Commi&s;&s;ioners to Canada on this errand.

<P>The in&s;tructions which they received from the Lieutenant Governors, Dummer and Wentworth, by advice of the Coun|cil and A&s;&s;embly of each Province, were nearly &s;imilar.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ma&s;&s;achu|&s;etts and N.-Hamp|&s;hire Rec.</NOTE> They were to demand of the French Governor, re&s;titution of the captives who had been carried into Can|ada; to remon&s;trate to him on his inju&s;|tice and breach of friend&s;hip, in counte|nancing the Indians in their ho&s;tilities again&s;t the people of New-England; to in&s;i&s;t on his withdrawing his a&s;&s;i&s;tance for the future; and to ob&s;erve to him, that if in the farther pro&s;ecution of the war, our Indian allies, &s;hould in their pur&s;uit of the enemy commit ho&s;tilities again&s;t the French, the blame would be entirely chargeable to him&s;elf. If the French Gov|ernor or the Indians, &s;hould make any over|tures for peace, they were empowered to

give them pa&s;&s;ports, to come either to Bo&s;ton or Port&s;mouth, for that purpo&s;e, and to return; but they were not to enter into any treaty with them. The Com|mi&s;&s;ioners were al&s;o furni&s;hed with the original letters of Vaudreuil to the Gov|ernors of New-England, and to the Je&s;uit Rall&egrave;, and with copies of the &s;everal trea|ties which had been made with the Indi|ans.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jan. 20.</NOTE> The gentlemen went by the way of Albany, and over the lakes, on the ice, to Montreal,<NOTE PLACE="marg">March 2.</NOTE> where they arrived after a tedi|ous and dangerous journey.</P>
<P>The Marquis, who happened to be at Montreal, received and entertained them with much politene&s;s. Having delivered their letters, and produced their commi&s;|&s;ions, they pre&s;ented their remon&s;trance in writing, and made the &s;everal demand<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> agreeably to their in&s;tructions; u&s;ing this among other arguments,
<Q>Tho&s;e Indians dwell either in the dominions of the King of Great-Britain, or in the territories of the French King: If in the French King's dominions, the violation of the peace is very flagrant,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Atkin&s;on's MS Journ|al.</NOTE> they then being his &s;ub|jects; but if they are &s;ubjects of the Brit|i&s;h Crown, then much more is it a breach of the peace, to excite a rebellion among the &s;ubjects of his Maje&s;ty of Great-Britain.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="023166_0073_0FBC777BBB411140">The Governor gave them no written an&s;wer; but denied that the Abenaquis were under his government, and that he had either encouraged or &s;upplied them for the purpo&s;e of war. He &s;aid that he con&s;id|ered them as an independent nation, and that the war was undertaken by them, in defence of their lands, which had been in|vaded by the people of New-England. The Commi&s;&s;ioners in reply, informed him, that the lands for which the Indians had quarrelled, were fairly purcha&s;ed of their ance&s;tors, and had been for many years inhabited by the Engli&s;h. They produced his own letters to the Governors of New-England, in which he had (incon|&s;i&s;tently, and perhaps inadvertently) &s;tyl|ed the&s;e Indians
<Q>&s;ubjects of the King of France.</Q>
They al&s;o alleged the &s;everal treaties held with them as evidence that they had acknowledged them&s;elves &s;ub|jects of the Briti&s;h Crown; and, to his great mortification, they al&s;o produced his own original letters to the Je&s;uit Ral|l&egrave;, which had been taken at Norridgwog, in which the evidence of his a&s;&s;i&s;ting and encouraging them in the war was too flag|rant to admit of palliation. Farther to &s;trengthen this part of their argument, they pre&s;ented to the Governor, a Mohawk
<PB N="74" REF="023166_0074_0FBC777DA5503730">
whom they had met with at Montreal, who, according to his own voluntary ac|knowledgment, had been &s;upplied by the Governor with arms, ammunition and provi&s;ion to engage in the war, and had killed one man and taken another whom he had &s;old in Canada.</P>
<P>In addition to what was urged by the Commi&s;&s;ioners in general; Mr. Atkin&s;on, on the part of New-Hamp&s;hire, entered into a particular remon&s;trance; alleging that the Indians had no cau&s;e of contro|ver&s;y with that Province, the lands in que&s;tion being out of their claim. To this the Governor an&s;wered, that New-Hamp&s;hire was a part of the &s;ame nation, and the Indians could make no di&s;tinction. Atkin&s;on a&s;ked him why they did not for the &s;ame rea&s;on make war on the people of Albany? The Governor an&s;wered,
<Q>The people of Albany have &s;ent a me&s;|&s;age to pray me to re&s;train the &s;avages from mole&s;ting them; in a manner very different from your demands:</Q>
To which Atkin&s;on with equal &s;pirit replied,
<Q>Your Lord&s;hip then is the right per&s;on, for our Governments to apply to, if the In|dians are &s;ubject to your orders.</Q></P>
<P>Finding him&s;elf thus clo&s;ely pre&s;&s;ed, he promi&s;ed to do what lay in his power
<PB N="75" REF="023166_0075_0FBC777EC7CA7220">
to bring them to an accommodation, and to re&s;tore tho&s;e captives who were in the hands of the French, on the payment of what they had co&s;t; and he engaged to &s;ee that no unrea&s;onable demands &s;hould be made by the per&s;ons who held them in &s;ervitude; as to tho&s;e who &s;till remained in the hands of the Indians, he &s;aid, he had no power over them, and could not engage for their redemption. He com|plained in his turn, of the Governor of New-York, for building a fort on the riv|er Onondago, and &s;aid, that he &s;hould look upon that proc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eding as a breach of the treaty of peace; and he boa&s;ted that he had the five nations of the Iroquois &s;o much under his influence, that he could at any time, cau&s;e them to make war up|on the &s;ubjects of Great-Britain.</P>
<P>The Commi&s;&s;ioners employed them&s;elves very diligently in their inquiries re&s;pect|ing the captives, and in &s;ettling the terms of their redemption. They &s;ucceeded in effecting the ran&s;om of &s;ixteen, and engag|ing for ten others. The Governor oblig|ed the French, who held them, to abate of their demands; but after all, they were paid for at an exorbitant rate. He was extremely de&s;irous, that the gentlemen &s;hould have an interview with the Indians,
<PB N="76" REF="023166_0076_0FBC7780652E0930">
who were at war; and for this purpo&s;e, &s;ent for a number of them from the vil|lage of St. Francis, and kept them con|cealed in Montreal. The Commi&s;&s;ioners had repeatedly told him, that they had no power to treat with them, and that they would not &s;peak to them unle&s;s they &s;hould de&s;ire peace. At his reque&s;t, the chiefs of the Nipi&s;&s;ins vi&s;ited the Commi&s;|&s;ioners, and &s;aid that they di&s;approved the war which their children the Abenaquis had made, and would per&s;uade them to a&s;k for peace. After a variety of manoeu|vres, the Governor at length promi&s;ed the Commi&s;&s;ioners, that if they would con&s;ent to meet the Indians at his hou&s;e, they &s;hould &s;peak fir&s;t. This a&s;&s;urance produc|ed an interview; and the Indians a&s;ked the commi&s;&s;ioners whether they would make propo&s;als of peace? they an&s;wered, No. The Indians then propo&s;ed, that
<Q>if the Engli&s;h would demoli&s;h all their forts, and remove one mile we&s;tward of Saco river; if they would rebuild their church at Norridgwog, and <HI>re&s;tore to them their prie&s;t,</HI> they would be brothers again.</Q>
The Commi&s;&s;ioners told them that they had no warrant to treat with them; but if they were di&s;po&s;ed for peace, they &s;hould have &s;afe conduct to and from Bo&s;ton or Port&s;mouth; and the Governor promi&s;ed
<PB N="77" REF="023166_0077_0FBC7781C5C4A388">
to &s;end his &s;on with them to &s;ee ju&s;tice done. They an&s;wered, that
<Q>this was the only place to conclude peace, as the na|tions were near and could readily attend.</Q>
The Governor would have had them recede from their propo&s;als, which he &s;aid were unrea&s;onable, and make others; but fath|er Le Cha&s;e, a Je&s;uit, being pre&s;ent, and acting as interpreter for the Indians, em|barra&s;&s;ed the matter &s;o much that nothing more was propo&s;ed. It was ob&s;erved by the commi&s;&s;ioners, that when they con|ver&s;ed with the Governor alone, they found him more candid and open to con|viction, than when Le Cha&s;e, or any oth|er Je&s;uit was pre&s;ent; and, through the whole of their negociation, it evidently appeared, that the Governor him&s;elf, as well as the Indians, were &s;ubject to the powerful influence of the&s;e eccle&s;ia&s;tics; of whom there was a &s;eminary in Canada, under the direction of the Abb&egrave; de Bel|mont.</P>
<P>Having completed their bu&s;ine&s;s, and the rivers and lakes being clear of ice, the Commi&s;&s;ioners took their leave of the Gov|ernor, and &s;et out on their return, with the redeemed captives, and a guard of &s;ol|diers, which the Governor ordered to at|tend them, as far as Crown-point. They
<PB N="78" REF="023166_0078_0FBC778342350870">
went down the river St. Lawrence to the mouth of the Sorel, then up that river to Chamblee, and through the lakes to fort Nichol&s;on. After a plea&s;ant pa&s;&s;age, of &s;even days,<NOTE PLACE="marg">May 1.</NOTE> they arrived at Albany.</P>
<P>Here they found Commi&s;&s;ioners of In|dian affairs for the Province of New-York, to whom they communicated the ob&s;erva|tions which they had made in Canada, and what the Marquis de Vaudreuil had &s;aid re&s;pecting the five nations, and the fort at Onandago. There being a deputa|tion from the&s;e nations at Albany, they held a conference with them, and gave them belts; reque&s;ting their a&s;&s;i&s;tance in e&s;tab|li&s;hing a peace with the Abenaquis. From this place Mr. Atkin&s;on wrote to M. Cav|anielle, &s;on of the Marquis, acknowledg|ing the polite reception the Commi&s;&s;ion|ers had met with from the family; &s;ub|joining a copy of the information which they had given to the Commi&s;&s;ioners of New-York; and promi&s;ing, that a due repre&s;entation &s;hould be made, to the Kings of England and France, on the &s;ub|ject of their negociation.</P>
<P>The report of the Commi&s;&s;ioners being laid before the A&s;&s;emblies of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts and New-Hamp&s;hire, it was determined to pro&s;ecute the war with vigor. Orders
<PB N="79" REF="023166_0079_0FBC7786BB972C38">
were i&s;&s;ued for the defence and &s;upply of the frontiers, and for the encouragement of ranging parties,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A&s;&s;embly Records.</NOTE> both volunteers and militia. A petition was &s;ent to the King, complaining of the French Governor, and de&s;iring that orders might be given to the other Colonies of New-England, and to New-York, to furni&s;h their quotas of a&s;|&s;i&s;tance, in the further pro&s;ecution of the war; and letters were written to the Gov|ernor of New-York, reque&s;ting that &s;uch of the ho&s;tile Indians as &s;hould re&s;ort to Albany, might be &s;eized and &s;ecured.</P>
<P>The good effects of this mi&s;&s;ion to Can|ada were &s;oon vi&s;ible. One of the Indian ho&s;tages who had been detained at Bo&s;ton through the whole war, together with one who had been taken, were allowed on their parole, to vi&s;it their countrymen; and they returned with a reque&s;t for peace. Commi&s;&s;ioners from both Provinces went to St. George's; where a conference was held, which ended in a propo&s;al for a far|ther treaty at Bo&s;ton. In the mean time, &s;ome of the enemy were di&s;po&s;ed for furth|er mi&s;chief. Tho&s;e who had been con|cerned in taking Han&s;on's family at Dov|er, in a &s;hort time after their redemption and return, came down with a de&s;ign to take them again, as they had threatened
<PB N="80" REF="023166_0080_0FBC7789388F6A78">
them before they left Canada. When they had come near the hou&s;e, they ob&s;erv|ed &s;ome people at work in a neighbouring field,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sept. 15.</NOTE> by which it was nece&s;&s;ary for them to pa&s;s, both in going and returning. This obliged them to alter their purpo&s;e, and conceal them&s;elves in a barn, till they were ready to attack them. Two women pa&s;&s;ed by the barn, while they were in it, and had ju&s;t reached the garri&s;on as the guns were fired. They &s;hot Benjamin Evans dead on the &s;pot; wounded Willi|am Evans and cut his throat; John Evans received a &s;light wound in the brea&s;t, which bleeding plentifully, deceived them, and thinking him dead, they &s;tripped and &s;calped him: He bore the painful opera|tion without di&s;covering any &s;igns of life, though all the time in his perfect &s;en&s;es, and continued in the feigned appearance of death, till they had turned him over, and &s;truck him &s;everal blows with their guns, and left him for dead. After they were gone off he ro&s;e and walked, naked and bloody, toward the garri&s;on; but on meeting his friends by the way drop|ped, fainting on the ground, and being covered with a blanket was conveyed to the hou&s;e. He recovered and lived fifty years. A pur&s;uit was made after the en|emy,
<PB N="81" REF="023166_0081_0FBC778AC78114E0">
but they got off undi&s;covered, carry|ing with them Benjamin Evans, junior, a lad of thirteen years old, to Canada, whence he was redeemed as u&s;ual by a charitable collection.</P>
<P>This was the la&s;t effort of the enemy in New-Hamp&s;hire. In three months, the treaty which they de&s;ired was held at Bo&s;|ton,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dec. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&punc;</NOTE> and the next &s;pring ratified at Fal|mouth. A peace was concluded in the u&s;ual form; which was followed by re|&s;training all private traffic with the Indi|ans, and e&s;tabli&s;hing truck-hou&s;es in con|venient places, where they were &s;upplied with the nece&s;&s;aries of life,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hutchin|&s;on II.318.</NOTE> on the mo&s;t advantageous terms. Though the govern|ments on the whole, were lo&s;ers by the trade, yet it was a more honorable way of pre&s;erving the peace, than if an acknow|ledgment had been made to the Indians in any other manner.</P>
<P>None of the other Colonies of New-England bore any &s;hare in the expen&s;es or calamities of this war; and New-Hamp|&s;hire did not &s;uffer &s;o much as in former wars; partly by rea&s;on of the more ex|tended frontier of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, both on the ea&s;tern and we&s;tern parts, again&s;t the former of which the enemy directed their greate&s;t fury; and partly by rea&s;on of the
<PB N="82" REF="023166_0082_0FBC778C6EE67C28">
&s;ucce&s;s of the ranging parties, who con|&s;tantly traver&s;ed the woods as far north|ward as the White Mountains. The militia at this time was completely train|ed for active &s;ervice; every man of forty years of age having &s;een more than twen|ty years of war. They had been u&s;ed to handle their arms from the age of childhood, and mo&s;t of them, by long practice, had become excellent mark&s;men, and good hunters. They were well acquainted with the lurking places of the enemy; and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a degree of hardine&s;s and in|trepidity, which can be acquired only by the habitude of tho&s;e &s;cenes of danger and fatigue, to which they were daily expo&s;ed. They had al&s;o imbibed from their infancy a &s;trong antipathy to the &s;avage natives; which was &s;trengthened by repeated hor|rors of blood and de&s;olation, and not ob|literated by the intercour&s;e which they had with them in time of peace. As the Indians frequently re&s;orted to the frontier towns in time of &s;carcity, it was common for them to vi&s;it the families whom they had injured in war; to recount the cir|cum&s;tances of death and torture which had been practi&s;ed on their friends; and when provoked or intoxicated, to threaten a rep|etition of &s;uch in&s;ults, in future wars. To
<PB N="83" REF="023166_0083_0FBC778DB464FAA8">
bear &s;uch treatment required more than human patience; and it is not improba|ble that &s;ecret murders were &s;ometimes the con&s;equence of the&s;e har&s;h provoca|tions. Certain it is, that when any per|&s;on was arre&s;ted, for killing an Indian in time of peace, he was either forcibly re&s;cu|ed from the hands of ju&s;tice, or if brought to trial, invariably acquitted; it being im|po&s;&s;ible to impannel a jury &s;ome of whom had not &s;uffered by the Indians, either in their per&s;ons or families.</P>

<P>DURING the war, the Lieutenant Governor had managed the execu|tive department with much prudence; the people were &s;atisfied with his admini&s;tra|tion, and entertained an affection for him, which was expre&s;&s;ed not only by words, but by frequent grants of money, in the General A&s;&s;embly. When he returned from Bo&s;ton,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1726.</NOTE> where the treaty of peace was concluded,<NOTE PLACE="marg">January 5.</NOTE> they pre&s;ented to him an ad|dre&s;s of congratulation, and told him that

This addre&s;s was followed by a grant of one hundred pounds. He had, ju&s;t before, con&s;ented to an emi&s;&s;ion of two thou&s;and pounds in bills of credit, to be paid, one half in the year 1735, and the other half in 1736. An exci&s;e was laid for three years, and was farmed for three hundred pounds.</P>

By the con&s;truction which Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts put on their charter, all the lands three miles northward of the river Merrimack were within their limits. On this principle, a grant had formerly been made to Gover|nor Endicot, of &s;ome lands at Penacook; which had been the &s;eat of a numerous and powerful tribe of Indians. The qual|ity of the land at that place invited the attention of adventurers from Andover, Bradford and Haverhill;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ma&s;&s;achu|&s;etts Rec.</NOTE> to whom a grant was made of a town&s;hip, &s;even miles &s;quare; comprehending the lands on both &s;ides of the Merrimack, extending &s;outh|wardly from the branch called Contoo|cook. This grant awakened the atten|tion of others; and a motion was made in the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts A&s;&s;embly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dec. 21.</NOTE> for a line of town&s;hips, to extend from Dun&s;table on Merrimack, to Northfield on Connec|ticut river; but the motion was not im|mediately adopted. The A&s;&s;embly of New-Hamp&s;hire was alarmed. Newman, their agent, had been a long time at the Briti&s;h Court, &s;oliciting the &s;ettlement of the line,
<PB N="86" REF="023166_0086_0FBC7ED40D6D2628">
and a &s;upply of military &s;tores for the fort. Fre&s;h in&s;tructions were &s;ent to him to ex|pedite the bu&s;ine&s;s, and to &s;ubmit the &s;et|tlement of the line to the King. A com|mittee was appointed to go to Penacook, to confer with a committee of Ma&s;&s;achu|&s;etts,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. Hamp|&s;hire Rec.</NOTE> then employed in laying out the lands, and to remon&s;trate again&s;t their proceeding. A &s;urvey of other lands near Winipi&s;eogee lake, was ordered; that it might be known, what number of town|&s;hips could be laid out, independently of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts claim. On the other hand, the heirs of Allen renewed their en|deavours, and one of them, John Hobby, petitioned the A&s;&s;embly to compound with him for his claim to half the Prov|ince; but the only an&s;wer which he could obtain was that 'the Courts of law were competent to the determination of titles,' and his petition was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>Both Provinces became earne&s;tly engag|ed. Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts propo&s;ed to New-Hamp&s;hire the appointment of commi&s;|&s;ioners, to e&s;tabli&s;h the line. The New-Hamp&s;hire A&s;&s;embly refu&s;ed, becau&s;e they had &s;ubmitted the ca&s;e to the King. The Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts people, fore&s;eeing that the re&s;ult of this application might prove un|favorable to their claim of juri&s;diction,

The de&s;cend|ants of the officers and &s;oldiers, who had been employed in expeditions again&s;t the Narragan&s;et Indians, and again&s;t Can|ada, in the preceding century, were ad|mitted; and the &s;urvivors of the late Cap|tain Lovewell's company,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ma&s;&s;achu|&s;etts Rec.</NOTE> with the heirs of the decea&s;ed, had a &s;elect tract granted to them at Suncook.

All the&s;e, excepting the la&s;t, were un|doubtedly within their limits; but the grant of Bow interfered with the grants which Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts had made, at Pena|cook and Suncook, and gave ri&s;e to a liti|gation, tedious, expen&s;ive, and of forty years continuance.</P>
<P>The&s;e tracts of land granted by both Provinces were too numerous and exten|&s;ive.
<PB N="88" REF="023166_0088_0FBC7ED95EF27088">
It was impracticable to fulfil the conditions, on which the grants were made. Had the &s;ame liberal policy prevailed here as in Penn&s;ylvania, and had the importa|tion of emigrants from abroad been en|couraged, the country might have been &s;oon filled with inhabitants; but the peo|ple of Londonderry were already looked upon with a jealous eye, and a farther intru&s;ion of &s;trangers was feared, le&s;t they &s;hould prove a burden and charge to the community. People could not be &s;pared from the old towns. Penacook was almo&s;t the only &s;ettlement which was effected by emigrants from Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts. A &s;mall beginning was made, by the New-Hamp|&s;hire proprietors, at Bow, on Suncook riv|er; but the mo&s;t of the intermediate country remained uncultivated for many years. Schemes of &s;ettlement were indeed continually forming; meetings of propri|etors were frequently held, and an avari|cious &s;pirit of &s;peculating in landed prop|erty prevailed; but the real wealth and improvement of the country in&s;tead of being promoted were retarded.</P>

name of George II. The long continu|ance of this A&s;&s;embly was principally ow|ing to the ab&s;ence of Governor Shute, in who&s;e admini&s;tration it commenced; and the uncertainty of his return or the ap|pointment of a &s;ucce&s;&s;or. It had been deemed a grievance, and an attempt had been made in 1724 to limit the duration of A&s;&s;emblies to three years, in conformi|ty to the cu&s;tom of England. At the meeting of the new A&s;&s;embly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dec. 15.</NOTE> the fir&s;t bu&s;ine&s;s which they took up was to move for a triennial act. The Lieutenant Gov|ernor was di&s;po&s;ed to gratify them. Both Hou&s;es agreed in framing an act for a tri|ennial A&s;&s;embly, in which the duration of the pre&s;ent A&s;&s;embly was limited to three years (unle&s;s &s;ooner di&s;&s;olved by the commander in chief) writs were to i&s;&s;ue fifteen days at lea&s;t, before a new election; the qualification of a repre&s;entative was declared to be a freehold e&s;tate of three hundred pounds value.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Edition of Laws in 1771, page 166.</NOTE> The qualification of an elector was a real e&s;tate of fifty pounds, within the town or precinct where the election &s;hould be made; but habitancy was not required in either ca&s;e; the &s;electmen of the town, with the mod|erator of the meeting, were con&s;tituted judges of the qualifications of electors,

&s;aving an appeal to the Hou&s;e of Repre|&s;entatives. This act having been pa&s;&s;ed, in due form, received the royal approba|tion, and was the only act which could be called a con&s;titution or form of Gov|ernment, e&s;tabli&s;hed by the people of New-Hamp&s;hire; all other parts of their government being founded on royal com|mi&s;&s;ions and in&s;tructions. But this act was defective, in not determining by whom the writs &s;hould be i&s;&s;ued, and in not de&s;|cribing the places from which Repre&s;enta|tives &s;hould be called, either by name, ex|tent or population. This defect gave birth to a long and bitter controver&s;y, as will be &s;een hereafter.</P>
<P>The triennial act being pa&s;&s;ed, the Hou&s;e were di&s;po&s;ed to make other alterations in the government. An appeal was allowed in all civil ca&s;es from the inferior to the &s;uperior court; if the matter in contro|ver&s;y exceeded one hundred pounds, anoth|er appeal was allowed to the Governor and Council; and if it exceeded three hundred pounds, to the King in Council. The appeal to the Governor and Council was fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hed by Cutts's commi&s;&s;ion, and continued by &s;ub&s;equent commi&s;&s;ions and in&s;tructions. In Queen Anne's time, it was complained of as a grievance, that
<PB N="91" REF="023166_0091_0FBC7EDDB37FF1D8">
the Governor and Council received ap|peals and decided cau&s;es, without taking an oath to do ju&s;tice. An oath was then pre&s;cribed and taken. The authority of this court had been recogni&s;ed by &s;everal clau&s;es in the laws; but was di&s;reli&s;hed by many of the people; partly becau&s;e the judges who had before decided ca&s;es, were gene|rally members of the Council; partly be|cau&s;e no jury was admitted in this court of appeal; and partly becau&s;e no &s;uch in|&s;titution was known in the neighbouring Province of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts. The Hou&s;e moved for a repeal of the &s;everal clau&s;es in the laws relative to this obnoxious court; the Council non-concurred their vote, and referred them to the royal in|&s;tructions. The Hou&s;e per&s;i&s;ted in their endeavors, and the Council in their oppo|&s;ition. Both &s;ides grew warm, and there was no pro&s;pect of an accommodation. The Lieuteunant Governor put an end to the &s;e&s;&s;ion, and &s;oon after di&s;&s;olved the A&s;&s;embly by proclamation.</P>
<P>A new A&s;&s;embly was called; the &s;ame per&s;ons, with but two or three exceptions,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1728.</NOTE> were re-elected, and the &s;ame &s;pirit ap|peared in all their tran&s;actions. They cho&s;e for their &s;peaker Nathaniel Weare, who had been &s;peaker of the former A&s;|&s;embly,
<PB N="92" REF="023166_0092_0FBC7EE18F828908">
and having as u&s;ual pre&s;ented him to the Lieutenant Governor, he negatived the choice. The Hou&s;e de&s;ired to know by what authority; he produced his com|mi&s;&s;ion; nothing appeared in that, which &s;atisfied them; and they adjourned from day to day without doing any bu&s;ine&s;s. After nine days they cho&s;e another Speak|er, Andrew Wiggin, and &s;ent up the vote, with a preamble, ju&s;tifying their former choice. The Lieutenant Governor ap|proved the Speaker, but di&s;approved the preamble; and thus the controver&s;y clo&s;|ed, each &s;ide retaining their own opinion. The &s;peeches and me&s;&s;ages from the chair, and the an&s;wers from the Hou&s;e, during this &s;e&s;&s;ion, were filled with reproaches; the public bu&s;ine&s;s was conducted with ill humour, and the Hou&s;e carried their op|po&s;ition &s;o far as to pa&s;s a vote for addre&s;&s;|ing the King to annex the Province to Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts; to this vote the Council made no an&s;wer. But as a new Governor was expected, they agreed in appointing a committee of both Hou&s;es to go to Bo&s;|ton, and compliment him on his arrival.</P>
<P>The expected Governor was WILLIAM BURNET, &s;on of the celebrated Bi&s;hop of Sarum, who&s;e name was dear to the peo|ple of New-England, as a &s;teady and ac|tive

friend to civil and religious liberty. Mr. Burnet was a man of good under|&s;tanding and polite literature; fond of books and of the conver&s;ation of literary men; but an enemy to o&s;tentation and parade. He had been Governor of New-York and New-Jer&s;ey, and quitted tho&s;e Provinces with reluctance, to make way for another per&s;on, for whom the Briti&s;h Mini&s;try had to provide. Whil&s;t at New-York, he was very popular, and his fame having reached New-England, the expect|ations of the people were much rai&s;ed on the news of his appointment, to the Gov|ernment of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts and New-Hamp&s;hire. Lieutenant Governor Went|worth characteri&s;ed him in one of his &s;peeches as
<Q>a gentleman of known worth, having ju&s;tly obtained an univer&s;al regard from all who have had <HI>the honor</HI> to be under his government.<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 22.</NOTE></Q>
He was received with much parade at Bo&s;ton, whither the Lieutenant Governor of New-Hamp&s;hire, with a committee of the Council and A&s;|&s;embly, went to compliment him on his arrival.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Mr. Hutchin&s;on has repre&s;ented Governor Burnet as a man of humour, and given an anecdote re&s;pecting his indifference to the cu&s;tom of &s;aying grace at meals.

<P>One of the committee, who went from Bo&s;ton, to meet him on the borders of Rhode-I&s;land, and conduct him to the &s;eat of government, was the facetious Col. Tailer.

<P><PB N="94" REF="023166_0094_0FBC7EE53B6B9410">Mr. Burnet had po&s;itive in&s;tructions from the crown to in&s;i&s;t on the e&s;tabli&s;h|ment of a permanent &s;alary in both his Provinces.

<P>When the death of Governor Burnet was known in England,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1730.</NOTE> the re&s;entment again&s;t the Province of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts was very high,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Letter<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of Francis W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lks, Agent.</NOTE> on account of their determined refu&s;al to fix a &s;alary on the King's Gov|ernor. It was even propo&s;ed, to reduce them to 'a more ab&s;olute dependence on the crown;' but a &s;pirit of moderation prevailed; and it was thought that Mr. JONATHAN BELCHER, then in England, being a native of the Province, and well acquainted with the temper of his coun|trymen would have more influence than a &s;tranger, to carry the favorite point of a fixed &s;alary. His appointment, as Govern|or of New-Hamp&s;hire, was merely an ap|pendage to his other commi&s;&s;ion.</P>

<P>Whil&s;t he was in England, and it was uncertain whether he would be appointed, or Shute would return, Wentworth wrote letters of compliment to both.

it is not ea&s;y at this time to deter|mine; the only qualifications, which appear to have pleaded in his favor, were pov|erty and the friend&s;hip of men in pow|er. He was an in&s;trument of intrigue and di&s;affection; and he no &s;ooner made his appearance in New-Hamp&s;hire, than he joined the party who were in oppo&s;ition to the Governor. Belcher perceived the advantage which his enemies would derive from this alliance, and made all the ef|forts in his power to di&s;place him. In his letters to the mini&s;try, to the Board of Trade, and to his friends in England, he continually repre&s;ented him in the wor&s;t light,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Belcher's MS letters.</NOTE> and &s;olicited his removal. It is not improbable, that his numerous letters of this kind, written in his u&s;ual &s;tyle, with great freedom and without any re&s;erve, might confirm the &s;u&s;picions, rai&s;ed by the letters of his adver&s;aries, and induce the mini&s;try to keep Dunbar in place, as a check upon Belcher, and to pre&s;erve the balance of parties.</P>

<P>The only effect which Dunbar's letters had at that time, was to procure the ap|pointment of Theodore Atkin&s;on, Benning Wentworth and Jo&s;hua Peirce, to be Coun&s;ellors of New-Hamp&s;hire; and though Belcher remon&s;trated to the Sec|retary of State again&s;t the&s;e appointments, and recommended other per&s;ons in their room, he could not prevail, any farther than to delay the admi&s;&s;ion of the two former for about two years; during which time, they were elected into the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives, and kept up the oppo&s;i|tion there. The recommendations, which he made of other per&s;ons, were duly attend|ed

to when vacancies happened; and thus the Council was compo&s;ed of his friends, and his enemies. The civil officers, whom he appointed, were &s;ometimes &s;uper&s;eded, by per&s;ons recommended and &s;ent from England; and in one in&s;tance, a commi&s;|&s;ion for the naval office, in favor of a Mr. Reynolds, &s;on of the Bi&s;hop of Lincoln, was filled up in England, and &s;ent over with orders for him to &s;ign it; which he was obliged punctually to obey.</P>
<P>From the confidential letters of the leading men on both &s;ides, which have fallen into my hands in the cour&s;e of my re&s;earches, the views of each party may plainly be &s;een;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Belcher's Waldron<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s Atkin&s;on's &amp; Thom|lin&s;on's letters MS.</NOTE> though they endeavored to conceal them from each other. The Governor and his friends had projected an union of New-Hamp&s;hire with Ma&s;&s;a|chu&s;etts; but were at a lo&s;s by what means to bring it into effect. The mo&s;t de&s;irable method would have been, an unanimity in the people of New-Hamp|&s;hire, in petitioning the Crown for it; but as this could not be had, the project was kept out of &s;ight, till &s;ome favorable op|portunity &s;hould pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>The other party contemplated not only the continuance of a &s;eparate government, but the appointment of a di&s;tinct Gover|nor,
<PB N="105" REF="023166_0104_0FBC7EFB66731BF0">
who &s;hould re&s;ide in the Province, and have no connection with Ma&s;&s;achu|&s;etts. The greate&s;t ob&s;tacle in their way, was the &s;mallne&s;s and poverty of the Prov|ince, which was not able to &s;upport a gen|tleman in the character of Governor. To remove this ob&s;tacle, it was nece&s;&s;ary to have the limits of territory, not only fix|ed, but enlarged. They were therefore zealous, in their attemps for this purpo&s;e; and had the addre&s;s to per&s;uade a majori|ty of the people, that they would be gain|ers by the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the lines; that the lands would be granted to them and their children; and that the expen&s;e of obtaining the &s;ettlement would be &s;o trif|ling, that each man's &s;hare would not exceed the value of a pullet.</P>
<P>The Governor's friends were aver&s;e to pre&s;&s;ing the &s;ettlement of the line; and their rea&s;ons were the&s;e. The controver|&s;y is either between the King and the &s;ub|jects of his charter government of Ma&s;&s;a|chu&s;etts; or el&s;e, between the heirs of Ma&s;on or Allen and the people of Ma&s;&s;a|chu&s;etts. If the controver&s;y be &s;ettled even in favor of New-Hamp&s;hire, the lands which fall within the line, will be either the King's property, to be granted by his Governor and Council according to royal

in&s;tructions; or el&s;e the property of the heirs of Ma&s;on or Allen, to be di&s;po&s;ed of by them. On both &s;uppo&s;itions, the peo|ple of New-Hamp&s;hire can have no prop|erty in the lands, and therefore why &s;hould they be zealous about the divi|&s;ion or tax them&s;elves to pay the expen&s;e of it?</P>
<P>The Governor, as obliged by his in|&s;tructions, frequently urged the &s;ettlement of the lines in his &s;peeches, and declared, that the A&s;&s;embly of New-Hamp&s;hire had done more toward effecting it, than that of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts. A committee from both Provinces met at Newbury in the autumn of 1731,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sept. 21.</NOTE> on this long conte&s;ted affair; but the influence of that party in Ma&s;&s;a|chu&s;etts, of which Eli&s;ha Cooke was at the head, prevented an accommodation. Soon after this fruitle&s;s conference, the Repre&s;entatives of New-Hamp&s;hire, of whom a majority was in favor of &s;ettling the line, determined no longer to treat with Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts; but to repre&s;ent the matter to the King, and petition him to decide the controver&s;y.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A&s;&s;embly Records.</NOTE> Newman's com|mi&s;&s;ion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Oct. 7.</NOTE> as agent, having expired, they cho&s;e for this purpo&s;e, John Rindge, merchant, of Port&s;mouth, then bound on a voyage to London. The appointment
<PB N="107" REF="023166_0106_0FBC7EFDF77AF8F0">
of this gentleman was fortunate for them, not only as he had large connexions in England; but as he was capable of ad|vancing money, to carry on the &s;olicita|tion. The Council, a majority of which was in the oppo&s;ite intere&s;t, did neither concur in the appointment, nor con&s;ent to the petition.</P>
<P>Mr. Rindge, on his arrival in England, petitioned the King in his own name,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1732.</NOTE> and in behalf of the Repre&s;entatives of New-Hamp&s;hire,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Feb. 28.</NOTE> to e&s;tabli&s;h the boundaries of the Province; but his private affairs requiring his return to America, he did, agreeably to his in&s;tructions, leave the bu&s;ine&s;s in the hands of Capt. John Thomlin&s;on, merchant, of London; who was well known in New-Hamp&s;hire, where he had frequently been in quality of a &s;ea commander. He was a gentleman of great penetration, indu&s;try and addre&s;s; and having fully entered into the views of Belcher's opponents, pro&s;ecuted the af|fair of the line, 'with ardor and dili|gence;' employing for his &s;olicitor, Fer|dinando John Parris; who being well &s;upplied with money, was indefatigable in his attention. The petition was of cour&s;e referred to the Lords of Trade, and Fran|cis Wilks the agent of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, was &s;erved with a copy to be &s;ent to his con|&s;tituents.</P>
<P><PB N="108" REF="023166_0107_0FBC7EFFBB75B9B8">Whil&s;t the matter of the line was pend|ing on the other &s;ide of the Atlantic, the parties in New-Hamp&s;hire maintained their oppo&s;ition; and were on all occa&s;ions vilifying and abu&s;ing each other, e&s;pecial|ly in their letters to their friends in Eng|land. On the one &s;ide, Belcher ince&s;&s;antly repre&s;ented Dunbar, as the fomenter of oppo&s;ition; as fal&s;e, perfidious, malicious and revengeful; that he did no &s;ervice to the crown, nor to him&s;elf; but was
<Q>a plague to the Governor and a deceiver of the people.</Q>
He was al&s;o very liberal in his reflections, on his other oppo&s;ers. On the other &s;ide, they repre&s;ented him as un|friendly to the royal intere&s;t; as ob&s;truct|ing the &s;ettlement of the lines; conniving at the de&s;truction of the King's timber, and partial to his other government, where all his intere&s;t lay; and that he had not even a freehold in New-Hamp&s;hire. As an in&s;tance of his partiality, they alleged, that in almo&s;t every &s;e&s;&s;ion of the A&s;&s;em|bly of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, he con&s;ented to grants of the di&s;puted lands,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1733.</NOTE> to the people of that Province; by which means, their A&s;&s;embly rai&s;ed money, to enable their agent to protract the controver&s;y, that they might have opportunity to lay out more town&s;hips; while at the &s;ame time,
<PB N="109" REF="023166_0108_0FBC7F034C8F7828">
he rejected a &s;upply bill of the New-Hamp&s;hire A&s;&s;embly, and di&s;&s;olved them, becau&s;e that in it, they had made an appro|priation for their agent. The truth was, that the Council did not con&s;ent to the bill, becau&s;e they had no hand in appoint|ing the agent, and the bill never came be|fore the Governor. The frequent di&s;&s;o|lution of A&s;&s;emblies was another &s;ubject of complaint; and in fact this mea&s;ure never produced the de&s;ired effect; for the &s;ame per&s;ons were generally re-elected, and no reconciling mea&s;ures were adopted by either party.</P>
<P>The Governor frequently complained, in his &s;peeches,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1734.</NOTE> that the public debts were not paid; nor the fort, pri&s;on, and other public buildings kept in repair; becau&s;e of their failure in &s;upplying the trea&s;ury. The true rea&s;on of their not &s;upplying it was, that they wanted emi&s;&s;ions of paper money, to be drawn in, at di&s;tant periods; to this the Governor could not con&s;ent, being re&s;trained by a royal in&s;truction, as well as in principle oppo&s;ed to all &s;uch practices. But one emi&s;&s;ion of paper was made in his admini&s;tration; and for its redemption a fund was e&s;tabli&s;hed in hemp, iron, and other productions of the coun|try. When a number of merchants and
<PB N="110" REF="023166_0109_0FBC7F04B9B573E8">
others had combined to i&s;&s;ue notes, to &s;upply the place of a currency, he i&s;&s;ued a proclamation again&s;t them; and in his next &s;peech to the A&s;&s;embly, condemned them in very &s;evere terms. The A&s;&s;embly endeavored to vindicate the character of the bills, but in a few days he di&s;&s;olved them, with a reprimand; charging them with trifling, with inju&s;tice and hypocri&s;y. It mu&s;t be remembered, that his com|plaints of an empty trea&s;ury were not oc|ca&s;ioned by any failure of his own &s;alary, which was regularly paid out of the exci&s;e.</P>
<P>Belcher revived the idea of his predece&s;|&s;or Shute, which was al&s;o countenanced by his in&s;tructions, that he was virtually pre&s;ent in New-Hamp&s;hire, when per&s;on|ally ab&s;ent, and attending his duty, in his other Province; and therefore that the Lieutenant Governor could do nothing but by his orders. Dunbar had no &s;eat in the Council, and Shadrach Walton be|ing &s;enior member, by the Governor's or|der &s;ummoned them and pre&s;ided. He al&s;o held the command of the fort, by the Governor's commi&s;&s;ion, granted pa&s;&s;es for &s;hips, and licen&s;es for marriage; and re|ceived and executed military orders, as occa&s;ion required. The Lieutenant Gov|ernor conte&s;ted this point; but could not
<PB N="111" REF="023166_0110_0FBC7F06459B5550">
prevail; and finding him&s;elf reduced to a &s;tate of in&s;ignificance, he retired in di&s;gu&s;t, to his fort at Pemaquid; where he re&s;ided almo&s;t two years. The Governor's friends gave out that he had ab&s;conded for debt, and affected to triumph over the oppo&s;i|tion, as poor and impotent; but their complaints, &s;upported by their agent Thomlin&s;on, and the influence of Bladen at the Board of Trade, made an impre&s;&s;ion there much to the di&s;advantage of Mr. Belcher; though he had friends among the mini&s;try and nobility; the principal of whom was Lord Town&s;end, by who&s;e in|fluence he had obtained his commi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>After Dunbar's return to Port&s;mouth, the Governor thought it good policy to relax his &s;everity; and gave him the com|mand of the fort, with the ordinary per|qui&s;ites of office, amounting to about fifty pounds &s;terling. Not content with this, he complained, that the Governor did not allow him one third of his &s;alary. The Governor's &s;alary was but &s;ix hundred pounds currency; he &s;pent at lea&s;t one hundred, in every journey to New-Hamp|&s;hire, of which he made two in a year. At the &s;ame time Dunbar had two hun|dred pounds &s;terling, as Surveyor General of the woods; which, with the perqui&s;ites,
<PB N="112" REF="023166_0111_0FBC7F07B2AE6168">
amounting to one hundred more, were divided between him and his deputies. But it mu&s;t be remembered that he was deeply in debt, both here and in England.</P>
<P>The rigid execution of the office of Surveyor General had always been attend|ed with difficulty; and the violent manner, in which Dunbar proceeded with tre&s;|pa&s;&s;ers, rai&s;ed a &s;pirit of oppo&s;ition on &s;uch occa&s;ions. The &s;tatutes for the pre|&s;ervation of the woods impowered the &s;ur|veyor to &s;eize all logs, cut from white pine trees, without licen&s;e; and it re&s;ted on the claimant, to prove his property, in the court of Admiralty. Dunbar went to the &s;aw-mills; where he &s;eized and marked large quantities of lumber; and with an air and manner to which he had been accu&s;tomed in his military capacity, abu&s;ed and threatened the people. That cla&s;s of men, with whom he was di&s;po&s;ed to contend, are not ea&s;ily intimidated with high words; and he was not a match for them, in that &s;pecies of controver&s;y, which they have denominated <HI>&s;wamp law.</HI> An in&s;tance of this happened at Dover, whith|er he came, with his boat's crew, to re|move a parcel of boards, which he had &s;eized. The owner, Paul Gerri&s;h, warned him of the con&s;equence; Dunbar threat|ened
<PB N="113" REF="023166_0112_0FBC7F0AC3C126B0">
with death the fir&s;t man who &s;hould ob&s;truct his intentions; the &s;ame threat was returned to the fir&s;t man who &s;hould remove the boards. Dunbar's prudence at this time, got the better of his courage, and he retired.</P>
<P>With the like &s;pirit, an attempt of the &s;ame kind was fru&s;trated at Exeter, whith|er he &s;ent a company in a boat to remove lumber. Whil&s;t his men were regaling them&s;elves at a public hou&s;e, in the even|ing, and boa&s;ting of what they intended to do the next day; a number of per&s;ons, di&s;gui&s;ed like Indians, attacked and beat them; whil&s;t others cut the rigging and &s;ails of the boat, and made a hole in her bottom. The party not finding them&s;elves &s;afe in the hou&s;e, retreated to the boat, and pu&s;hed off; but being there in dan|ger of &s;inking, they with difficulty regain|ed the &s;hore, and hid them&s;elves till morn|ing, when they returned on foot to Port&s;|mouth.</P>
<P>This was deemed a flagrant in&s;ult. Dunbar &s;ummoned the Council,<NOTE PLACE="marg">April 26.</NOTE> and com|plained to them of the riotous proceedings at Exeter, where there was
<Q>a con&s;piracy again&s;t his life, by evil minded per&s;ons, who had hired Indians to de&s;troy him.</Q>
He propo&s;ed to the Council, the i&s;&s;uing
<PB N="114" REF="023166_0113_0FBC7F0CF1AF7B80">
of a proclamation, offering a reward to apprehend the rioters. The major part of the Council were of opinion, that no proclamation could be i&s;&s;ued but by the Governor.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This was al&s;o the Governor's opinion; and in his letters he fre|quently a&s;&s;erts that Dunbar had no command in New-Hamp&s;hire, whil&s;t he was in either of his governments. To be con&s;i&s;tent, he &s;hould have maintained, that the Lieutenant Governor of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts had no command whil&s;t he was in New-Hamp&s;hire; but there occurs <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> in&s;tance of a proclamation i&s;&s;ued by Lieutenant Governor P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ip<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, (March 25, 1737) on occa&s;ion of a riot at Bo&s;ton, whil&s;t the Gover|nor was in New-Hamp&s;hire; and at his return, he i&s;&s;ued another, in which he refers to the former, not only without cen&s;uring it, but i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> terms of approbation.</NOTE> Information being &s;ent to the Governor, he i&s;&s;ued a proclamation; commanding all magi&s;trates to a&s;&s;i&s;t in di&s;covering the rioters.</P>
<P>This tran&s;action afforded matter for complaint, and a memorial was drawn up by Thomlin&s;on, grounded on letters which he had received. It was &s;ugge&s;ted, that the Governor's pretence to favor the &s;ur|veyor was deceitful; that the rioters at Exeter were his greate&s;t friends; that the Council,<NOTE PLACE="marg">MS letters.</NOTE> wholly devoted to him, would not advi&s;e to a proclamation till they had &s;ent to Bo&s;ton; that the proclamation was delayed; and when it appeared offer|ed no reward; though Dunbar had pro|po&s;ed to pay the money him&s;elf; and, that by rea&s;on of this delay and omi&s;&s;ion, the rioters e&s;caped with impunity.</P>
<P><PB N="115" REF="023166_0114_0FBC7F0E8B7D5860">In ju&s;tice to Mr. Belcher, it mu&s;t be &s;aid, that there was no delay on his part, the proclamation being &s;ent from Bo&s;ton within &s;ix days. It al&s;o appears, from the &s;ecret and confidential letters of the Gov|ernor, that he di&s;approved the riot, and even called it rebellion; that he gave par|ticular orders to the magi&s;trates, to make inquiry, and take depo&s;itions, and do their utmo&s;t to di&s;cover the rioters. If he did not adverti&s;e a reward, it was becau&s;e there was no money in the trea&s;ury; and if Dunbar had been &s;incere in his of|fer to pay it, he might have promi&s;ed it, by adverti&s;ement. The true rea&s;on that the rioters were not di&s;covered, was, that their plan was &s;o artfully conducted, their per&s;ons &s;o effectually di&s;gui&s;ed, and their confidence in each other &s;o well placed, that no proof could be obtained; and the &s;ecret remained with them&s;elves, till the danger was over, and the government had pa&s;&s;ed into other hands.</P>
<P>A law had been made, for holding the Inferior Court of Common Pleas, alter|nately in each of the four old towns; and the practice had been continued for &s;eve|ral years, much to the convenience and &s;atisfaction of the people; but Dunbar remon&s;trated again&s;t it, to the Board of

This tran&s;action &s;erved as matter of fre&s;h complaint,<NOTE PLACE="marg">June 13.</NOTE> and was alleg|ed as an argument for the appointment of a Governor, who &s;hould re&s;ide con&s;tantly in the Province.</P>
<P>To fini&s;h what relates to Dunbar. He was care&s;&s;ed by the party in oppo&s;ition to Belcher, under the idea that he had inter|e&s;t enough in England, to obtain a com|mi&s;&s;ion for the government of New-Hamp&s;hire. In 1737 he went to England to pro&s;ecute his de&s;ign; where, by his old creditors, he was arre&s;ted and thrown into pri&s;on. Thomlin&s;on found means to liberate him; but perceived that he had neither &s;teadine&s;s nor ability for the &s;ta|tion at which he aimed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Thomlin|&s;on's let|ters, MS.</NOTE> nor intere&s;t enough to obtain it; though, by his pre|&s;ence
<PB N="117" REF="023166_0116_0FBC7F13B2572948">
in England, he &s;erved to keep up the oppo&s;ition to Belcher, and was u&s;ed as a tool for that purpo&s;e, till the object was accompli&s;hed. After which he was (1743) appointed, by the Ea&s;t India Company, Governor of St. Helena.</P>
<P>The trade of the Province at this time con&s;i&s;ted chiefly in the exportation of lumber and fi&s;h to Spain and Portugal, and the Caribbee I&s;lands. The ma&s;t trade was wholly confined to Great Britain. In the winter &s;mall ve&s;&s;els went to the &s;outh|ern Colonies,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Belcher's Letters to the Board of Trade.

The manufacture of iron within the Prov|ince, which had been &s;et up by the late Lieutenant Governor Wentworth, and other gentlemen, lay under di&s;courage|ment, for want of experienced and indu&s;|trious workmen. The woollen manufac|ture was dimini&s;hed, and &s;heep were &s;carc|er than formerly; the common lands on which they u&s;ed to feed, being fenced in by the proprietors. The manufacture of linen was much increa&s;ed by means of the emigrants from Ireland, who were &s;killed in that bu&s;ine&s;s. No improvements were made in agriculture, and the newly grant|ed town&s;hips were not cultivated with &s;pirit or &s;ucce&s;s.</P>

<P>The mo&s;t, who died of this pe&s;tilence, were children; and the di&s;tre&s;s, which it occa&s;ioned, was heightened to the mo&s;t poignant degree. From three to &s;ix chil|dren

were lo&s;t out of &s;ome families; &s;eve|ral buried four in a day, and many lo&s;t their all. In &s;ome towns, one in three, and in others one in four of the &s;ick were carried off. In the pari&s;h of Hampton-Falls it raged mo&s;t violently. Twenty families buried all their children. Twen|ty &s;even per&s;ons were lo&s;t out of five fa|milies; and more than one &s;ixth part of the inhabitants of that place died within thirteen months. In the whole Province, not le&s;s than one thou&s;and per&s;ons, of whom above nine hundred were under twenty years of age, fell victims to this raging di&s;temper.</P>
<P>Since the &s;ettlement of this country &s;uch a mortality had not been known. It was ob&s;erved, that the di&s;temper proved mo&s;t fatal, when plentiful evacuations, particu|larly bleeding, were u&s;ed; a great pro&s;tra|tion of &s;trength being an invariable &s;ymp|tom. The &s;ummer of 1735, when the &s;ick|ne&s;s began, was unu&s;ually wet and cold, and the ea&s;terly wind greatly prevailed. But it was acknowledged to be, not
<Q>a crea|ture of the &s;ea&s;ons;</Q>
as it raged through every part of the year. Its extent is &s;aid to have been 'from Pemaquid to Carolina;' but with what virulence it raged, or in what mea&s;ure it proved fatal, to the &s;outh|ward of New-England, does not appear.</P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="023166_0120_0FBC7F1C90276FE0">The &s;ame di&s;temper has made its ap|pearance at various times &s;ince. In 1754 and 1755, it produced a great mortality in &s;everal parts of New-Hamp&s;hire, and the neighbouring parts of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts. Since that time it has either put on a mild|er form, or phy&s;icians have become better acquainted with it. The la&s;t time of its general &s;preading was in 1784, 5, 6 and 7. It was fir&s;t &s;een at Sanford in the county of York; and thence diffu&s;ed it&s;elf, very &s;lowly, through mo&s;t of the towns of New-England; but its virulence, and the mor|tality which it cau&s;ed, were comparatively incon&s;iderable.

<HEAD>CHAP. XVII. State of parties. Controver&s;y about lines. Commi&s;&s;ioners appointed. Their &s;e&s;&s;ion and re&s;ult. Appeals. Complaints.</HEAD>
<P>WE have now come to that part of the Hi&s;tory of New-Hamp&s;hire, in which may be &s;een, operating in a &s;mall|er &s;phere, the &s;ame &s;pirit of intrigue which has frequently influenced the conduct of princes, and determined the fate of na|tions. Whil&s;t on the one hand, we &s;ee Ma&s;|&s;achu&s;etts &s;tiffly a&s;&s;erting her chartered claims; and looking with contempt, on the &s;mall Province of New-Hamp&s;hire, over which &s;he had formerly exerci&s;ed ju|ri&s;diction; we &s;hall &s;ee, on the other hand, New-Hamp&s;hire aiming at an equal rank, and contending with her for a large por|tion of territory; not depending &s;olely on argument; but &s;eeking her refuge in the royal favor, and making intere&s;t with the &s;ervants of the Crown. Had the contro|ver&s;y been decided by a court of law, the claims of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts would have had as much weight, as tho&s;e of an indi|vidual, in a ca&s;e of private property; but the que&s;tion being concerning a line of
<PB N="124" REF="023166_0123_0FBC7F2206CD5158">
juri&s;diction, it was natural to expect a de|ci&s;ion, agreeable to the rules of policy and convenience; e&s;pecially where the tribu|nal it&s;elf was a party concerned.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, that the party in New-Hamp&s;hire, who were &s;o earne&s;tly engaged in the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the boun|dary lines, had another object in view, to which this was &s;ubordinate. Their avowed intention was to fini&s;h a long con|trover&s;y, which had proved a &s;ource of inconvenience to the people who re&s;ided on the di&s;puted lands, or tho&s;e who &s;ought an intere&s;t in them; but their &s;ecret de&s;ign was to di&s;place Belcher, and obtain a Gov|ernor who &s;hould have no connexion with Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts. To accompli&s;h the prin|cipal, it was nece&s;&s;ary that the &s;ubordinate object &s;hould be vigoro&s;ly pur&s;ued. The Government of New-Hamp&s;hire, with a &s;alary of &s;ix hundred pounds, and perqui|&s;ites amounting to two hundred pounds more, equal in the whole to about eight hundred dollars per annum, was thought to be not worthy the attention of any gentleman; but if the lines could be ex|tended on both &s;ides, there would be at once an increa&s;e of territory, and a pro&s;|pect of &s;peculating in landed property; and in future there would be an increa&s;e
<PB N="125" REF="023166_0124_0FBC7F2436893E20">
of cultivation, and con&s;equently of ability to &s;upport a Governor.</P>
<P>The people were told that the lands would be granted to them; and by this bait they were induced to favor the plan; whil&s;t the mini&s;try in England, were flat|tered with the idea, of an increa&s;e of crown influence in the plantations.</P>
<P>The leading men in Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts were aware of the views of tho&s;e in New-Hamp|&s;hire, and determined to guard again&s;t them. They pre&s;umed, that a line of ju|ri&s;diction would not affect property; and therefore endeavored to &s;ecure the lands to them&s;elves, by po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion and improve|ment, as far as it was practicable. The &s;ame idea prevailed among the Governor's friends in New-Hamp&s;hire. They per|ceived, that a tract of wilderne&s;s on the north ea&s;tern &s;ide of Merrimack River, and the ponds which flow into it, mu&s;t doubtle&s;s fall into New-Hamp&s;hire. For the&s;e lands they petitioned the Governor, and a charter was prepared, in which this whole tract, called King's-Wood, was granted to them. It contained all the lands not before granted, between the bounds of New-Hamp&s;hire on the &s;outh-we&s;t and north-ea&s;t; which, according to the ideas of tho&s;e concerned, would have been &s;ufficient for about four large town|&s;hips.</P>
<P><PB N="126" REF="023166_0125_0FBC7F25B38E9008">Governor Belcher had a difficult part to act. He was at the head of two rival Provinces; he had friends in both, who were &s;eeking their own as well as the pub|lic intere&s;t: He had enemies in both, who were watching him, eager to lay hold on the mo&s;t trivial mi&s;take, and magnify it to his di&s;advantage. His own intere&s;t was to pre&s;erve his commi&s;&s;ion, and counter|act the machinations of his enemies; but as the &s;ettlement of the line, and the re|moving of him from his office, were car|ried on at the &s;ame time, and by the &s;ame per&s;ons, it was difficult for him to oppo&s;e the latter, without &s;eeming to oppo&s;e the former. Be&s;ides, Mr. Wilks, the agent of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, was well known to be his friend; and when it was found nece&s;&s;ary to increa&s;e the number, one of them was his brother, Mr. Partridge. On the other hand, Mr. Rindge and Mr. Thomlin&s;on were his avowed enemies. There was al&s;o a differ|ence in the mode of appointing the&s;e a|gents. Tho&s;e of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts were con|&s;tituted by the Council and Repre&s;enta|tives, with the Governor's con&s;ent. Tho&s;e of New-Hamp&s;hire were cho&s;en by the Repre&s;entatives only, the Council non|concurring in the choice; which, of cour&s;e,
<PB N="127" REF="023166_0126_0FBC7F273339EC10">
could not be &s;anctioned by the Governor's &s;ignature, nor by the &s;eal of the Province.</P>
<P>When the petition which Rindge pre|&s;ented to the King,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1732.</NOTE> had been referred to the Board of Trade, and a copy of it giv|en to Wilks, to be &s;ent to his con&s;tituents, it became nece&s;&s;ary that they &s;hould in|&s;truct him. Their in&s;tructions were de|&s;ignedly expre&s;&s;ed in &s;uch ambiguous terms,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hutchin|&s;on II, 385. Wilks's petitions &amp; report of Board of Trade MS.</NOTE> that he was left to gue&s;s their mean|ing, and afterward blamed for not ob&s;erv|ing their directions. His embarra&s;&s;ment on this occa&s;ion, expre&s;&s;ed in his peti|tion and counter petition, to the Board of Trade, protracted the bu&s;ine&s;s, and gave it a complexion, unfavorable to his con|&s;tituents, but extremely favorable to the de&s;ign of New-Hamp&s;hire.</P>
<P>To bring forward the controver&s;y,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1733.</NOTE> Par|ris, the &s;olicitor for the agents of New-Hamp&s;hire, moved a que&s;tion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Printed brief. MS report.</NOTE>
<Q>From what part of Merrimack river the line &s;hould begin?</Q>
The Board of Trade re|ferred this que&s;tion, to the Attorney and Solicitor General, who appointed a day to hear council on both &s;ides. The council for New-Hamp&s;hire in&s;i&s;ted, that the line ought to begin three miles north of the mouth of the Merrimack. The council for Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts declared, that in their opini|on,
<PB N="128" REF="023166_0127_0FBC7F2A223BBBA0">
the &s;olution of this que&s;tion would not determine the controver&s;y, and therefore declined &s;aying any thing upon it. The attorney and &s;olicitor reported, that
<Q>whether this were &s;o or not,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1734.</NOTE> they could not judge; but as the que&s;tion had been referred to them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jan. 5.</NOTE> they were of opinion, that according to the charter of Willi|am and Mary, the dividing line ough<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to be taken, from three miles north of the mouth of Merrimack, where it run into the &s;ea.</Q>
Copies of this opinion were given to each party; and the Lords of Trade reported,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1735.</NOTE> that the King &s;hould ap|point Commi&s;&s;ioners, from the neighbor|ing Provinces,<NOTE PLACE="marg">June 5.</NOTE> to mark out the dividing line. This report was approved by the Lords of Council.</P>
<P>Much time was &s;pent in references, me&s;&s;ages and petitions, concerning the adju&s;tment of various matters;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1737.</NOTE> and at length,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Feb. 4 &amp; 9.</NOTE> the principal heads of the com|mi&s;&s;ion were determined. The fir&s;t was, that the commi&s;&s;ioners &s;hould be appoint|ed, from among the Coun&s;ellors of New-York, New-Jer&s;ey, Rhode-I&s;land and No|va-Scotia. The&s;e were all royal govern|ments, except Rhode-I&s;land; and with that Colony, as well as New-York, Ma&s;|&s;achu&s;etts had a controver&s;y, re&s;pecting

Connecticut, though propo&s;ed, was de&s;ignedly omitted, becau&s;e it was imag|ined that they would be partial to Ma&s;&s;a|chu&s;etts, from the &s;imilarity of their habits and intere&s;ts. The other points were, that twenty commi&s;&s;ioners &s;hould be nominat|ed, of whom five were to be a quorum; that they &s;hould meet at Hampton, in New-Hamp&s;hire, on the fir&s;t of Augu&s;t,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Printed brief.</NOTE> 1737; that each Province &s;hould &s;end to the Commi&s;&s;ioners, <HI>at their fir&s;t meeting,</HI> the names of two public officers, on whom any notice, &s;ummons, or final judgment might be &s;erved; and at the &s;ame time &s;hould exhibit, in writing, a plain and full &s;tate of their re&s;pective claims, copies of which &s;hould be mutually exchanged; and that if either Province &s;hould neglect to &s;end in the names of their officers, or the full &s;tate of their demands, at the time appointed, then the Commi&s;&s;ioners &s;hould proceed <HI>ex parte.</HI> That when the Com|mi&s;&s;ioners &s;hould have made and &s;igned their final determination, they &s;hould &s;end copies to the public officers, of each Prov|ince; and then &s;hould adjourn for &s;ix weeks, that either party might enter their appeal.</P>
<P>The&s;e points being determined; the Board of Trade wrote letters to Belcher,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Feb. 18.</NOTE>

The&s;e were accompanied with letters to the Gover|nors of the &s;everal Provinces, from which the Commi&s;&s;ioners were elected, inform|ing them of their appointment. The letters were delivered to Parris, and by him to Thomlin&s;on,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Original letters of Parris.</NOTE> to be &s;ent by the fir&s;t &s;hip to America. Tho&s;e to Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts and New-Hamp&s;hire, were directed, the one to Mr. Belcher, by name, as Governor of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts; the other, to the com|mander in chief, <HI>re&s;ident</HI> in New-Hamp|&s;hire; and it was required that the delivery of the letters &s;hould be certified by affidavit. The de&s;ign of this &s;ingular injunction was, that Dunbar, if pre&s;ent, &s;hould receive the letter, and call the A&s;&s;embly of New-Hamp&s;hire immediately; and that if Belcher &s;hould forbid or hinder it, the blame of the neglect &s;hould fall on him. At the &s;ame time another letter, re&s;pect|ing a petition of a borderer on the line, and containing a reprimand to Belcher, was &s;ent in the &s;ame manner, to be deliv|ered by Dunbar, into Belcher's hands.

The&s;e intended affronts, both failed of their effect; Dunbar having, before the arrival of the letters, taken his pa&s;&s;age to England.</P>

three days, to the falls of Amu&s;keag; an account of which was publi&s;hed in the papers, and concluded in the following manner:

<P>In the &s;peech, which the Governor made to the A&s;&s;embly of New-Hamp&s;hire, he recommended to them to appoint two officers, agreeably to his Maje&s;ty's com|mi&s;&s;ion. The A&s;&s;embly appeared to be much &s;urpri&s;ed at this &s;peech; and in their an&s;wer, &s;aid, that

<P>Con&s;idering the temper and views of Mr. Belcher's opponents, this was rather unfortunate for him, &s;o &s;oon after his profe&s;&s;ion of being 'a common father to both Provinces.' For if the committee had a right to nominate the two officers, then his recommendation was needle&s;s; if they had not, it might ju&s;tly be a&s;ked, why did he not call the A&s;&s;emb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y together, on the &s;ixth of July, to which day they had been prorogued? The excu&s;e was,
<PB N="141" REF="023166_0140_0FBC7F42F9695B70">
that he did it, to avoid any objection, which might be made to the regularity of their appointment; and to give them an opportunity to ratify and confirm it. The truth was, that Mr. Belcher highly re|&s;ented the conduct of the committee of New-Hamp&s;hire, who concealed the com|mi&s;&s;ion, and never communicated it to him in form. Had he been aware of the u&s;e, which his enemies might make, of his rigid adherence to forms, when he could not but know the contents of the com|mi&s;&s;ion, and the time when it mu&s;t be ex|ecuted, prudence might have dictated a more flexible conduct. They did not fail, to make the utmo&s;t advantage of his mi&s;|takes, to &s;erve the main cau&s;e which they had in view.</P>
<P>The expre&s;&s;es which were &s;ent by Ma&s;|&s;achu&s;etts, to call the other Commi&s;&s;ion|ers, had no other effect than to add to the number, Philip Living&s;tone, from New-York; who, being &s;enior in nomination, pre&s;ided in the Court.</P>
<P>To prevent the delay, which would un|avoidably attend the taking of plans from actual &s;urveys; the Commi&s;&s;ioners recom|mended, to both A&s;&s;emblies, to agree upon a plan, by which the preten&s;ions of each Province &s;hould be under&s;tood; but as
<PB N="142" REF="023166_0141_0FBC7F448827F3A0">
this could not be done, a plan drawn by Mitchel was accepted, and when their re|&s;ult was made this plan was annexed to it. They then proceeded to hear the an|&s;wers, which each party made, to the de|mands of the other, and to examine wit|ne&s;&s;es on both &s;ides. Neither party was willing to admit the evidence, produced by the other, and mutual exceptions and prote&s;ts were entered. The points in de|bate were, whether Merrimack river, at that time, emptied it&s;elf into the &s;ea, at the &s;ame place where it did &s;ixty years be|fore? Whether it bore the &s;ame name, from the &s;ea, up to the crotch? and wheth|er it were po&s;&s;ible to draw a parallel line, three miles northward, of every part of a river; the cour&s;e of which was, in &s;ame places, from north to &s;outh?</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the boundary line, be|tween New-Hamp&s;hire and Maine; the controverted points were, whether it &s;hould run up the middle of the river, or on its north-ea&s;tern &s;hore; and whether the line, from the head of the river, &s;hould be due north-we&s;t, or only a few degrees we&s;tward of north.</P>
<P>The grand point on which the whole controver&s;y re&s;pecting the &s;outhern line turned, was, whether the charter of Wil|liam
<PB N="143" REF="023166_0142_0FBC7F45F377E358">
and Mary granted to Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, all the lands which were granted, by the charter of Charles the fir&s;t? On this que&s;|tion, the Commi&s;&s;ioners did not come to any conclu&s;ion. Rea&s;ons of policy might have &s;ome weight, to render them indeci|&s;ive; but, whether it were really &s;o or not, they made and pronounced their re&s;ult in the following words.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sept 2.</NOTE>
<Q>In pur&s;uance of his Maje&s;ty's commi&s;&s;ion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">MS Copy.</NOTE> the Court took under con&s;ideration, the evidences, pleas, and allegations offered and made by each party;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Journal of Ma&s;&s;achu|&s;etts A&s;|&s;embly, p. 35.</NOTE> and upon mature advi&s;ement on the whole, a doubt aro&s;e in point of law; and the Court thereupon came to the following re&s;olution. That if the char|ter of King William and Queen Mary, grants to the Province of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts Bay, all the lands granted by the charter of King Charles the fir&s;t, lying to the northward of Merrimack river; then the Court adjudge and determine, that a line &s;hall run, parallel with the &s;aid river, at the di&s;tance of three Engli&s;h miles, north from the mouth of the &s;aid river, beginning at the &s;outherly &s;ide of the Black Rocks, &s;o called, at low wa|ter mark) and from thence to run to the crotch, where the rivers of Pemigewa&s;&s;et and Winipi&s;eogee meet; and from thence
<PB N="144" REF="023166_0143_0FBC7F48AD3DF478">

<P><Q>As to the northern boundary, between the &s;aid Provinces, the Court re&s;olve and determine; that the dividing line &s;hall pa&s;s up through the mouth of Pi&s;cata|qua harbour, and up the middle of the river of Newichwanock, (part of which is now called Salmon-Falls) and through the middle of the &s;ame, to the farthe&s;t

head thereof, and from thence north, two degrees we&s;terly, until one hundred and twenty miles be fini&s;hed, from the mouth of Pi&s;cataqua harbour afore&s;aid; or until it meets with his Maje&s;ty's other governments. And, that the dividing line &s;hall part the I&s;les of Shoals, and run through the middle of the harbour, between the i&s;lands, to the &s;ea, on the &s;outherly &s;ide; and that the &s;outhwe&s;ter|ly part of &s;aid i&s;lands &s;hall lie in, and be accounted part of, the Province of New-Hamp&s;hire; and that the north-ea&s;terly part thereof &s;hall lie in, and be account|ed part of, the Province of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts Bay; and be held and enjoyed by the &s;aid Provinces re&s;pectively, in the &s;ame man|ner as they now do, and have heretofore held and enjoyed the &s;ame.</Q></P>
<P><Q>And the Court do further adjudge, that the co&s;t and charge ari&s;ing by tak|ing out the Commi&s;&s;ion, and al&s;o of the Commi&s;&s;ioners and their officers, viz. the two Clerks, Surveyor and Waiter, for their travelling expen&s;es, and attendance in the execution of the &s;ame, be equally borne by the &s;aid Provinces.</Q></P>

<P>At this &s;e&s;&s;ion of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts A&s;|&s;embly, Mr. Belcher put them in mind that he had &s;uffered in his intere&s;t, by the continually &s;inking value of their bills of credit, in which his &s;alary was paid; a point which he had, often before,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hutch. II, 390.</NOTE> urged them to con&s;ider. In an&s;wer to this me&s;|&s;age, they made him a grant of &pound; 333, 6, 8,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Journal,</NOTE> in bills of the new tenor. The &s;ame day,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Oct. 19.</NOTE> they made a grant of the like &s;um, to the Pre&s;ident of Harvard College. Both the&s;e &s;ums appear to have been ju&s;tly due; and at any other time, no exception could have been made to either. But, becau&s;e the grant to the Governor happened to be made, at the &s;ame time with the grant of &pound; 2000 &s;terling to the agents, his opponents pre|tended, that he received it as a bribe, from the A&s;&s;embly of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, for favor|ing their cau&s;e.</P>
<P>The appeal of New-Hamp&s;hire, from the judgment of the Commi&s;&s;ioners,<NOTE PLACE="marg">MSS.</NOTE> was founded on the following rea&s;ons. With re&s;pect to the &s;outherly line; becau&s;e it made the Black Rocks, lying in a bay of Merrimack river, the point from which the three miles were to be mea&s;ured; which
<PB N="150" REF="023166_0149_0FBC7F533ABB8D90">
point was three quarters of a mile north of the river's mouth; and, becau&s;e a line, parallel with the river, was not only im|practicable, but founded on the old char|ter, which had been vacated; and, if prac|ticable, yet ought not to go farther than the river held a we&s;terly cour&s;e. With re&s;|pect to the northern boundary, they ob|jected to that part of the judgment only, which directed the line to run up the mid|dle of the river; alleging that the grant to Gorges was only of land, between that river and Kenebec; and that New-Hamp|&s;hire had always been in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the whole river, and had maintained a fortre&s;s which commanded its entrance.</P>
<P>The appeal of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts was ground|ed on the following rea&s;ons. That by the charter of William and Mary, the old Col|ony of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts was re-incorporated without any exception; that this charter empowered the Governor and General A&s;&s;embly to grant all lands, comprehended in the old Colony; that the committee of New-Hamp&s;hire acknowledged, that New-Hamp&s;hire lay without the late Colony of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, by declaring that it was between that and the Province of Maine; that the we&s;t line, claimed by New-Hamp|&s;hire, would cro&s;s Merrimack river, thirty
<PB N="151" REF="023166_0150_0FBC7F5436603638">
miles from its mouth, and exclude forty miles of &s;aid river out of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, though declared, by both charters, to be in it. They objected to extending the line of New-Hamp&s;hire till it &s;hould meet with his Maje&s;ty's other governments; becau&s;e according to <HI>Ma&s;on's grant,</HI> New-Hamp&s;hire could extend no farther than &s;ixty miles from the &s;ea. With re&s;pect to the northern boundary, they objected to a line north, two degrees we&s;twardly, alleging that it ought to be on the north|we&s;t point; they al&s;o excepted to the pro|traction of this line, till it &s;hould meet with his Maje&s;ty's other governments; al|leging that it ought to extend no farther than one hundred and twenty miles, the fixed limits of the Province of Maine.</P>
<P>It was unfortunate for Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts that their committee had brought Ma&s;on's grant, in evidence to the Commi&s;&s;ioners, and again recited it in their appeal; for a line of &s;ixty miles from the &s;ea would cro&s;s Merrimack river, long before the &s;imilar curve line, for which they contend|ed, could be completed. Be&s;ides, Ma&s;on's grant extended to Naumkeag; which was much further &s;outhward, than they would have been willing to admit.</P>
<P><PB N="152" REF="023166_0151_0FBC7F55E7232658">It may &s;eem curious and unaccounta|ble to mo&s;t readers, that the Commi&s;&s;ion|ers &s;hould determine the northern, or rath|er ea&s;tern bounds of the northern part of New-Hamp&s;hire, to be a line drawn <HI>north, two degrees we&s;terly,</HI> from the head of Sal|mon-fall River; when the expre&s;s words of Gorges' patent are 'north we&s;tward.' The agents for Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, when this claim was put in by New-Hamp&s;hire,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hutchin|&s;on II, 389.</NOTE> could hardly think it was &s;eriou&s;ly meant, when it was alleged that by northwe&s;t|ward mu&s;t be under&s;tood, north <HI>a little</HI> we&s;tward.<NOTE PLACE="marg">MS min|utes of the Commi&s;|&s;ioners.</NOTE> The only o&s;ten&s;ible rea&s;on, given for this con&s;truction was, that if a northwe&s;t line had been intended, then a &s;outhea&s;t line, drawn from the mouth of the harbour, would leave all the I&s;les of Shoals in New-Hamp&s;hire; whereas, the dividing line runs between them.

<P><PB N="153" REF="023166_0152_0FBC7F5849568890">When this affair was again agitated in England, the agents of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts ob|tained a certificate from the learned Dr. Halley, that a line northwe&s;tward ought to run forty-five degrees we&s;tward of the north point. This was demon&s;tratively true; but there were political rea&s;ons for di&s;&s;enting from mathematical demon&s;tra|tion. One of them is thus expre&s;&s;ed, in a private letter, from a committee of the A&s;&s;embly, to their agent Thomlin&s;on.
<Q>We hope that the northern line will be but a few degrees, to the we&s;tward of north, that his Maje&s;ty's Province may include the greate&s;t number, and be&s;t ma&s;t trees for the royal navy.</Q>
Though this thought might never have occurred to a mathematician, yet &s;ome of the Com|mi&s;&s;ioners were doubtle&s;s acquainted with it; and it was too important, not to have been communicated to the King's mini&s;|ters. Another political rea&s;on of di&s;&s;ent was, that by enlarging New-Hamp&s;hire, there would be a better pro&s;pect of obtain|ing a di&s;tinct Governor, which was the grand object in view.</P>

and Partridge, neither of whom under|&s;tood &s;o much of the controver&s;y as Thom|lin&s;on; who was al&s;o far &s;uperior to them in addre&s;s. In his letters, to his friends in New-Hamp&s;hire, he frequently blames them for their negligence, in not &s;ending to him the nece&s;&s;ary papers in proper &s;ea&s;on; and when &s;ent, for the want of correctne&s;s and regularity in them. But their deficiency was abundantly compen|&s;ated by the dexterity of his &s;olicitor, Par|ris; who drew up a long

in which, all the circum&s;tances, attending the whole tran&s;action, from the beginning, were recited, and colored, in &s;uch a manner, as to a&s;per&s;e the Governor and A&s;&s;embly of

was repre&s;ented as ready to be devoured, and the King's own prop|erty and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions &s;wallowed up, by the boundle&s;s rapacity of the charter govern|ment. Concerning the manner in which this ma&s;terly philippic was framed, and the principal object at which it was di|rected, there can be no better evidence, than that which is contained in a letter, written by Parris to Thomlin&s;on, and by him &s;ent to New-Hamp&s;hire.

<P>THE &s;pirit of intrigue was not con|fined to New-Hamp&s;hire; for the politicians of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, by bringing into view the long dormant claim of Ma|&s;on, had another game to play, be&s;ides proving the &s;mall extent of New-Hamp|&s;hire. They perceived that the line, whether &s;ettled according to their own demand or that of New-Hamp&s;hire, would cut off a con&s;iderable part of &s;eve|ral of their town&s;hips; and though they had, by their agent, obtained a promi&s;e, that private property &s;hould not be affect|ed by the line of juri&s;diction, yet they thought it be&s;t to have &s;ome other &s;ecu|rity.</P>

<P>On the receipt of this letter, Sir Charles, with the candor of a gentleman, &s;ent a copy of it to Mr. Belcher; who immedi|ately ordered an inquiry; and it was
<PB N="166" REF="023166_0165_0FBC7F6F331C7900">
proved to be an entire forgery; four of the per&s;ons who&s;e names were &s;ub&s;cribed utterly di&s;claimed it, and the fifth was not to be found; no &s;uch per&s;on being known in the town of Exeter. The evi|dence of this forgery was tran&s;mitted to England, with all po&s;&s;ible expedition; but not till it had made an impre&s;&s;ion, to the di&s;advantage of the Governor.</P>
<P>Another artifice u&s;ed again&s;t him, was a memorial of Gul&s;ton, the navy agent, and others; complaining of the defence|le&s;s &s;tate of the Province; that the fort lay in ruins, and that the militia were without di&s;cipline; notwith&s;tanding the probability of a war. This memorial was &s;o artfully drawn, as to throw the blame of the neglect on the Governor, without mentioning his name;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Belcher's letters MS.</NOTE> which was intended, to prevent his obtaining a copy, and being allowed time to an&s;wer. Another complaint was made in the form of a letter, re&s;pecting the grant of the tract called King&s;wood; in which he was repre&s;ented, as partial to his friends, in giving them an exclu&s;ive right, to the whole of that territory, which they deem|ed, the unappropriated lands of the Prov|ince. Several parts of his admini&s;tration were al&s;o complained of; and in particu|lar
<PB N="167" REF="023166_0166_0FBC7F71E9A2AD18">
the infrequency of his vi&s;its to New-Hamp&s;hire. This letter was &s;igned by &s;ix members of the Council, and a majority of the Repre&s;entatives.</P>
<P>Gul&s;ton's memorial was pre&s;ented to the Lords of Council; and by them re|ferred to the Board of Trade, accompani|ed by the letter; and though Mr. Belch|er's brother and &s;on applied for copies, and time to an&s;wer, the reque&s;t was evad|ed; and a report was framed, in favor of putting New-Hamp&s;hire under a &s;epa|rate Governor. When this report came before the Privy Council, Lord Wilming|ton, the Pre&s;ident, ordered it back again; that the Governor might have that ju&s;tice which his agents had a&s;ked. By this means, he had opportunity to an&s;wer in his defence; that without money, the fort could not be repaired; that it was not in his power to tax the people; that he had frequently applied to the A&s;&s;em|blies for money, to repair the fort; to which they had con&s;tantly an&s;wered, that the people were too poor to be taxed; and had &s;olicited him to break through his in&s;tructions, and allow them to i&s;&s;ue pa|per money, without any fund for its re|demption; that the militia had always been trained according to law; and that
<PB N="168" REF="023166_0167_0FBC7F73B7FC0FD0">
he had con&s;tantly vi&s;ited New-Hamp&s;hire, and held an A&s;&s;embly, twice in the year, unle&s;s prevented by &s;ickne&s;s; for which he appealed to the journals. To corrob|orate the&s;e pleas, the Governor's friends procured five petitions, in his favor, and praying for his continuance, &s;igned by about five hundred people. The petitions, however, did not expre&s;s the &s;en&s;e of the majority; who had been per&s;uaded into a belief, that they &s;hould receive much ben|efit by a &s;eparate Governor; and accord|ingly, a counter petition being circulated, was &s;igned by about &s;even hundred of the inhabitants.</P>
<P>Things being thus prepared, the com|plaints were brought to a hearing,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 21.</NOTE> before the Lords of Council;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Printed brief.</NOTE> who reported to the King,
<Q>that Governor Belcher had acted with great partiality, by prorogu|ing the A&s;&s;embly of New-Hamp&s;hire, from the &s;ixth of July, 1737, to the fourth of Augu&s;t following; in di&s;obe|dience to his Maje&s;ty's order in Council; which had been tran&s;mitted to him by the Lords of Trade, and which was proved to have been delivered to him, in due time; and, al&s;o by farther pro|roguing the &s;aid A&s;&s;embly, from the &s;ec|ond of September, 1737, to the thir|teenth
<PB N="169" REF="023166_0168_0FBC7F75721169D0">
of October; whereby the Prov|ince were deprived of the time, intended by his Maje&s;ty's &s;aid order, to be allow|ed them, to prepare a proper and regu|lar appeal; thereby endeavoring to fru&s;trate the intention of his Maje&s;ty's commi&s;&s;ion.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dec. 27.</NOTE></Q>
This report was approv|ed by the King; and from this time, it may be concluded, that Mr. Belcher's re|moval from the Government of New-Hamp&s;hire was &s;eriou&s;ly contemplated. The grant of King&s;wood was al&s;o an|nulled; and he was prohibited from mak|ing any other grants of land, till the lines &s;hould be determined.</P>
<P>This cen&s;ure being pa&s;&s;ed on the Gov|ernor,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1740.</NOTE> and the complaints being at an end; the way was prepared for a hearing of the appeals, from both Provinces,<NOTE PLACE="marg">March 5.</NOTE> re|&s;pecting the lines. Which being had, the determination of this long controver&s;y was made on a plan entirely new. The &s;pe|cial part of the decree of the Commi&s;&s;ioners was &s;et a&s;ide, and no regard was had to their <HI>doubt,</HI> whether the new charter grant|ed all the lands comprehended in the old. It was &s;aid, that when the fir&s;t grant was made, the country was not explored. The cour&s;e of the river, though unknown, was &s;uppo&s;ed to be from we&s;t to ea&s;t;
<PB N="170" REF="023166_0169_0FBC7F76B801D078">
therefore it was deemed equitable,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1739.</NOTE> that as far as the river flowed in that cour&s;e, the parallel line at three miles di&s;tance &s;hould extend. But as on the one hand, if by pur&s;uing the cour&s;e of the river, up into the country, it had been found to have a &s;outhern bend, it would have been in|equitable to have contracted the Ma&s;&s;a|chu&s;etts grant; &s;o, on the other hand, when it appeared to have a northern bend, it was equally inequitable to enlarge it. Therefore it was determined;
<Q>that the northern boundary of the Province of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts be, a &s;imilar curve line, pur&s;uing the cour&s;e of Merrimack river, at three miles di&s;tance,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Council Records.</NOTE> on the north &s;ide thereof, beginning at the Atlantic Ocean, and ending at a point due north of Pa|tucket falls; and a &s;traight line drawn from thence due we&s;t, till it meets with his Maje&s;ty's other governments.</Q>
The other parts of the decree of the Commi&s;|&s;ioners, re&s;pecting the northern line, and the payment of expen&s;es, were affirmed.</P>
<P>This determination exceeded the utmo&s;t expectation of New-Hamp&s;hire; as it gave them them a tract of country, four|teen miles in breadth, and above fifty in length, more than they had ever claimed. It cut off from Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, twenty eight
<PB N="171" REF="023166_0170_0FBC7F79B10EEDF0">
new town&s;hips,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1740.</NOTE> between Merrimack and Connecticut rivers; be&s;ides large tracts of vacant land, which lay intermixed; and di&s;tricts from &s;ix of their old towns, on the north &s;ide of the Merrimack; and if, as was then &s;uppo&s;ed, the due we&s;t line were to extend, to twenty miles ea&s;t of Hud&s;on's river, the reputed boundary of New-York; a va&s;t tract of fertile country, on the we&s;tern &s;ide of Connecticut river, was annexed to New-Hamp&s;hire; by which an ample &s;cope was given, fir&s;t for landed &s;peculation, and afterward for cultivation, and wealth.</P>
<P>When this determination was known, the politicians of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts were cha|grined and enraged.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Belcher's letters.</NOTE> They talked loudly of inju&s;tice; and &s;ome of the more zealous propo&s;ed trying the merits of the cau&s;e, upon the words of the charter, before the Judges in We&s;tmin&s;ter Hall; who, it was expected, would upon their oath and ho|nor rever&s;e the judgment, and tell the King that he had mi&s;taken the meaning of the royal charter. This would indeed have been a bold &s;troke. But a more moderate and pu&s;illanimous &s;cheme was adopted; which was to &s;end over a new agent, to petition the King, that he would re-annex to their government, the twenty

eight new town&s;hips, which had been cut off, and the di&s;tricts of the &s;ix old towns. It was al&s;o thought prudent,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Thomlin|&s;on's ob|&s;ervations on Ma&s;|&s;achu&s;etts petition. MS.</NOTE> that the whole Province &s;hould not openly appear, in the affair; but that petitions &s;hould be drawn, by the inhabitants of the&s;e towns, and that the agent &s;hould be cho&s;en by them. Accordingly town meetings were held; petitions were prepared and &s;ub&s;crib|ed; and THOMAS HUTCHINSON was ap|pointed their agent, and &s;ent over to Eng|land; where he formed tho&s;e connexion<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, which afterward &s;erved to rai&s;e him, to the chair of government in his native Province.</P>
<P>About the &s;ame time, Governor Belcher procured a petition,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Thomlin|&s;on's MS letters.</NOTE> from his &s;ix friends, of the Council of New-Hamp&s;hire, to the King; praying that the <HI>whole</HI> Province might be annexed to the government of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts. This matter had been long in contemplation, with the&s;e gentle|men; but was now produced at the mo&s;t unfortunate time, which could have been cho&s;en. Their petition was at once re|jected. But that from the towns was kept in &s;u&s;pen&s;e a long time; till Thom|lin&s;on was prepared, to an&s;wer all the pleas, which Hutchin&s;on could advance, and proved too hard an antagoni&s;t for him.
<PB N="173" REF="023166_0172_0FBC7F7D10F06918">
It was finally di&s;mi&s;&s;ed,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The ill &s;ucce&s;s of this agency was probably the rea&s;on, that Mr. Hutchin&s;on took no notice of it, in his Hi&s;tory of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts.</NOTE> becau&s;e it was thought,
<Q>that it never could be for his Maje&s;ty's &s;ervice,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bow brief.</NOTE> to annex any part of his Province of New-Hamp&s;hire, as an in|crea&s;e of territory, to Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts; but rather, that it would be for the benefit of his &s;ubjects there, to be under a di&s;tinct government.</Q></P>
<P>Though Belcher's removal was &s;eriou&s;ly feared, by his be&s;t friends; yet he had &s;o much intere&s;t with &s;ome of the Lords in high office, that they could not be prevail|ed with to give him up. The war, which had commenced between Britain and Spain, afforded him an opportunity, to &s;ignalize his zeal for the King's &s;ervice; and he determined to prove him&s;elf, a faithful &s;ervant to the Crown, in every in&s;tance; in hope that a cour&s;e of time and fidelity might efface the impre&s;&s;ions, which had been made, to his di&s;advantage.</P>
<P>It being re&s;olved by the Briti&s;h Court, to undertake an expedition to the I&s;land of Cuba; Governor Belcher, agreeably to the orders which he had received from the Duke of Newca&s;tle, i&s;&s;ued a proclamation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">April 29.</NOTE> for the encouragement of men who would enli&s;t in the &s;ervice;

the King's pay; have a &s;hare of the booty which &s;hould be taken; and be &s;ent home, at the expiration of their time of &s;ervice; and that his Maje&s;ty would order a num|ber of blank commi&s;&s;ions, to be filled up by the Governor, and given to the officers, who &s;hould command the troops, to be rai&s;ed in the Provinces.</Q>
He afterwards pre&s;&s;ed this matter,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Augu&s;t 1.</NOTE> clo&s;ely, in his &s;peech to the A&s;&s;embly; and urged them, to make provi&s;ion, for one hundred men, and a tran&s;port, to convey them to Virginia; where all the Colony troops were to ren|dezvous; and thence to proceed, under the command of Col. Gooch, to the place of their de&s;tination. The A&s;&s;embly voted, as much as they judged &s;ufficient for this purpo&s;e; and the Governor appointed a Captain, and gave him beating orders; but the commi&s;&s;ions and arms not being &s;ent, according to the royal promi&s;e, no men could be inli&s;ted in New-Hamp&s;hire.

in them; and yet his enemies failed not of blaming him on this account. The Repre&s;entatives of New-Hamp&s;hire took this occa&s;ion to frame a vote, di&s;approv|ing his admini&s;tration;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Augu&s;t.</NOTE> and upon this vote, their agent founded another battery,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Thomlin|&s;on's let|ters.</NOTE> to attack his character.</P>
<P>In conformity to the royal determina|tion of the boundaries,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1741.</NOTE> orders were given to Belcher, to apply to both his govern|ments, to join in appointing Surveyors, to run out, and mark the lines; and that if either &s;hould refu&s;e, the other &s;hould pro|ceed <HI>ex parte.</HI> The A&s;&s;embly of Ma&s;&s;a|chu&s;etts delayed giving an an&s;wer in &s;ea&s;on, which was con&s;trued a denial. The A&s;|&s;embly of New-Hamp&s;hire appointed three Surveyors, to execute the &s;ervice, who were commi&s;&s;ioned by the Governor. They were directed to allow ten degrees, for the we&s;terly variation of the needle; and the work was performed in the months of February and March. George Mitchel &s;urveyed and marked the &s;imilar curve line, from the ocean, three miles north of Merrimack river, to a &s;tation north of Patucket falls, in the town&s;hip of Dracut.

<P>The return of the&s;e lines to the Board of Trade was one of the la&s;t acts of Mr. Belcher's admini&s;tration. His enemies in both governments were indefatigable in their endeavors to remove him; and by their ince&s;&s;ant applications to the mini&s;try; by taking every advantage of his mi&s;takes; by fal&s;ehood and mi&s;repre&s;entation; and finally, by the diabolical arts of forgery and perjury,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dougla&s;s I.481.

<PB N="177" REF="023166_0176_0FBC7F840D3512B0">
be &s;uppo&s;ed impartial; it may &s;eem rather &s;trange, that Governor Belcher &s;hould meet with &s;uch treatment, from the Brit|i&s;h Court, in the reign of &s;o mild and ju&s;t a Prince, as George the &s;econd. That Mr. Belcher was imprudent and unguard|ed, in &s;ome in&s;tances, cannot be denied. He was indeed zealous to &s;erve his friends, and hearken to their advice; but, by this means, he laid him&s;elf open, to the attacks of his enemies; to whom he paid no court, but openly treated them with contempt. His language to them was &s;evere and reproachful, and he never &s;pared to tell the world, what he thought of them.</P>
<P>This provoked them; but they had the art to conceal their re&s;entment, and carry on their de&s;igns, in &s;ilence, till they were ripe for execution. He had by far too mean an opinion of their abilities, and the intere&s;t which they had at Court; and when he knew that they had the ear of the Lords of Trade, he affected to think them,
<Q>not very mighty Lords, nor able to admini&s;ter life and death.</Q>
He had a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s, of the general integrity of his own intentions; and appears to have been influenced, by motives of honor and ju&s;tice; but he was not aware of the force
<PB N="178" REF="023166_0177_0FBC7F8569E08520">
of his own prejudices. It may admit of doubt, whether, con&s;idering the extreme delicacy of his &s;ituation, it were within the compa&s;s of human policy, to have conducted &s;o as to give offence to neither of his Provinces, in the management of &s;uch a controver&s;y; but it is certain, that his antagoni&s;ts could not fairly fix but one real &s;tigma, on his character; and that when impartially examined, can amount to no more than an imprudent &s;tep, at a critical time, grounded on an undue re|&s;entment of an affront; for to &s;uppo&s;e that his <HI>intention</HI> was to fru&s;trate the com|mi&s;&s;ion, is incon&s;i&s;tent with the whole ten|or of his public declarations, and private corre&s;pondence. When his enemies met him on fair and open ground, he was al|ways prepared to an&s;wer; but it was im|po&s;&s;ible to guard again&s;t their &s;ecret at|tacks. If the cau&s;e which they meant to &s;erve was a good one, why did they employ the ba&s;e&s;t means to effect it?</P>
<P>The cruelty and hard&s;hip of his ca&s;e may appear from the following con&s;ider|ations. He had been one of the principal merchants of New-England;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Belcher's letter to Dodding|ton. MS.</NOTE> but, on his appointment, to the Chair of Government, quitted every other kind of bu&s;ine&s;s; that he might attend with punctuality and
<PB N="179" REF="023166_0178_0FBC7F8678DE74D8">
dignity to the duties of his &s;tation. By the royal in&s;tructions, he was re&s;trained from giving his a&s;&s;ent, to any grant of money, to him&s;elf; unle&s;s it &s;hould be a permanent &s;alary. What he received from New-Hamp&s;hire was fixed, and paid out of the exci&s;e; but the A&s;&s;embly of Ma&s;&s;a|chu&s;etts could not be per&s;uaded, to &s;ettle any &s;alary upon him. They made him a grant of three thou&s;and pounds, (worth about &s;even or eight hundred &s;terling) ge|nerally once in a year, at their &s;e&s;&s;ion in May. He was then obliged to &s;olicit leave from the King, to accept the grant, and &s;ign the bill; and &s;ometimes could not obtain this leave till the end of the year; once not till five days before the di&s;&s;olution of the A&s;&s;embly. In the mean time he was obliged to &s;ub&s;i&s;t on his own e&s;tate; and had he died within the year, the grant would have been wholly lo&s;t, to his family. He was earne&s;t to obtain a general permi&s;&s;ion to &s;ign the&s;e grants; but in that ca&s;e the clerks of offices, in England, through who&s;e hands the per|mi&s;&s;ion mu&s;t have pa&s;&s;ed, would have lo&s;t their fees. He was now in the &s;ixtieth year of his age; he had a family of chil|dren and grand children, who&s;e &s;ole de|pendence was on him; and he thought
<PB N="180" REF="023166_0179_0FBC7F881B3C59E0">
with rea&s;on, that if his cour&s;e of faithful &s;ervice, and the unworthy arts of his ene|mies had been duly con&s;idered; the cen|&s;ure of his &s;uperiors would have been le&s;s &s;evere, than
<Q>to deprive him of his bread and honor.</Q></P>
<P>Whil&s;t he entertained the wor&s;t opinion po&s;&s;ible of the characters of his enemies, he had a &s;trong confidence, in the ju&s;tice of the government, before which he was accu&s;ed. In one of his letters to his &s;on, he &s;ays,
<Q>I mu&s;t expect no favor while Bladen is at the Board of Trade; but were the devil there, I &s;hould expect ju&s;|tice, under the Briti&s;h Con&s;titution, cor|roborated by the Hanover &s;ucce&s;&s;ion.</Q>
The event proved, that his confidence was not ill founded. For, on being &s;uper&s;eded, he repaired to Court; where, though his pre&s;ence was unwelcome to &s;ome, yet he had opportunity to bring the mo&s;t con|vincing evidence of his integrity, and of the ba&s;e de&s;igns of his enemies. He was &s;o far re&s;tored to the royal favor, that he obtain|ed a promi&s;e, of the fir&s;t vacant government in America, which would be worthy of his acceptance. This proved to be the Province of New-Jer&s;ey; where he &s;pent the remain|ing years of his life; and where his memo|ry has been treated with de&s;erved re&s;pect.</P>

<P>BENNING WENTWORTH, E&s;q. &s;on of the decea&s;ed Lieutenant Gov|enor, was a merchant of good reputation in Port&s;mouth, and well beloved by the people. He had repre&s;ented his native town in the A&s;&s;embly for &s;everal years, where he di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf in the op|po&s;ition to Belcher. He afterward obtain|ed a &s;eat in Council; where, &s;en&s;ible of the popularity of his family, and feeling the pride of elevation, he continued the oppo&s;ition, and joined in the mea&s;ures which were pur&s;ued for obtaining a di&s;|tinct Governor, without any apprehen&s;ion that him&s;elf would be the per&s;on; till a &s;eries of incidents, at fir&s;t view unfortu|nate, prepared the way for his advance|ment to the chair.</P>
<P><PB N="182" REF="023166_0181_0FBC7F8CE5D91640">In the cour&s;e of his mercantile dealings, he had entered into a contract with an agent of the Court of Spain, and &s;upplied him with a large quantity of the be&s;t oak timber; to procure which, he borrowed money in London. When he delivered the timber at Cadiz, the agent with whom he had contracted, was out of place, and the new officer declined payment. In re|turning to America the &s;hip foundered and he was &s;aved with the crew in a boat. The&s;e misfortunes deranged his affairs and reduced him to a &s;tate of bankruptcy. Afterward he went again to Spain, hop|ing by the intere&s;t of Sir Benjamin Keene, the Briti&s;h Mini&s;ter, to obtain his due, but his &s;uit was ineffectual. About that time Thomlin&s;on, de&s;pairing of Dunbar's ad|vancement to the government of New-Hamp&s;hire, turned his thoughts toward Wentworth;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Thomlin|&s;on's let|ters.

In his fir&s;t &s;peech to the A&s;&s;embly he reflected on the conduct of his predece&s;&s;or, not by name, but by implication; for not having taken early mea&s;ures to rai&s;e men for the expedition again&s;t the Spani&s;h We&s;t-Indies; and in|timated his apprehen&s;ion, that the good intention of the Province in rai&s;ing money

for that purpo&s;e,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1742.</NOTE> would be fru&s;trated, &s;ince the men who were willing to enter into the &s;ervice had enli&s;ted in the other Provinces. He al&s;o complimented them, on their good faith in regard to the &s;everal emi&s;&s;ions of paper money; all of which were to be called in within the pre&s;ent year. He did not forget to recommend a fixed &s;alary for him&s;elf, not &s;ubject to de|preciation; nor the payment of expen&s;es which had ari&s;en on account of the bound|ary lines; he informed them of the King's indulgence, in giving him leave to con&s;ent to a farther emi&s;&s;ion of bills of credit, to enable them to di&s;charge their obligations to the Crown; provided that no injury &s;hould be done to the trade of the mother country. He al&s;o recommended to their attention the faithful &s;ervices of their a|gents, one of whom, Rindge, was dead, and the payment of the debt due to his heirs.</P>
<P>The A&s;&s;embly, in their an&s;wer, acknow|ledged the wi&s;dom and ju&s;tice of the King in determining the long controver&s;y be|tween them and Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts; but as to payment of the expen&s;e, they reminded him that one half ought to be paid by Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, and de&s;ired him to u&s;e his influence for that purpo&s;e. With re&s;pect
<PB N="185" REF="023166_0184_0FBC80D075D88BC0">
to the failure of rai&s;ing men for the expe|dition, they &s;et him right by a&s;cribing it to the true cau&s;e; there being no commi&s;|&s;ions &s;ent to the Province for that &s;ervice. Concerning the &s;alary, they &s;aid, that as &s;oon as they could know what number of inhabitants would be added to them by the &s;ettlement of the lines, and how the money could be rai&s;ed, they &s;hould make as ample provi&s;ion for his honorable &s;up|port as their circum&s;tances would admit. They acknowledged the fidelity and in|du&s;try of their agents, and profe&s;&s;ed a good will to reward them; but could not then promi&s;e adequate compen&s;ation.</P>
<P>The A&s;&s;embly voted a &s;alary of two hundred and fifty pounds,<NOTE PLACE="marg">MS acts.</NOTE> proclamation money, to the Governor, funded as u&s;ual on the exci&s;e; and having obtained the royal licen&s;e for emitting twenty-five thou&s;and pounds on loan for ten years, they granted the Governor two hundred and fifty pounds more, to be paid annu|ally out of the intere&s;t of the loan. When this fund failed, they made annual grants for his 'further and more ample &s;upport,' and generally added &s;omething for hou&s;e|rent. They pre&s;ented their agent Thom|lin&s;on one hundred pounds &s;terling, for his faithful &s;ervices; but what they did for the heirs of Rindge does not appear.</P>

<P>The&s;e appointments of Mr. Wentworth gave the oppo&s;ers of the former admini|&s;tration great cau&s;e of triumph; but the &s;pirit of oppo&s;ition had only changed &s;ides. It was hoped and expected by &s;ome, that Mr. Belcher, by going to England, would not only remove the ill impre&s;&s;ions, which the malice of his enemies had made; but return to his former &s;tation.

are left as evidence of the exi&s;tence of de&s;igns, which were never brought to ma|turity.</P>
<P>It was one of the royal in&s;tructions to Governors, that in any ca&s;es of difficulty or &s;udden emergency, they &s;hould com|municate with each other. Mr. Went|worth had a high opinion of the abilities of the new Governor of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, and there being a &s;trict friend&s;hip between them, con&s;ulted him on all occa&s;ions. Shirley was gratified by this deference, and knew how to make his advantage of it. Thus, though New-Hamp&s;hire was under a Governor di&s;tinct from that of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, a point which had long been contended for; yet the difference was not &s;o great in reality as in appear|ance.<NOTE PLACE="marg">MS <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nt|worth and Shirley.</NOTE> This was a circum&s;tance not much known at that time.

<P>The war which had been kindled be|tween Britain and Spain,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1744.</NOTE> extended its flame over a great part of Europe; and when France became involved in it, the American Colonies were more nearly in|tere&s;ted, becau&s;e of the proximity of the French, and of the Indians, who were in their intere&s;t. War is &s;o natural to &s;av|ages,
<PB N="188" REF="023166_0187_0FBC80D5B3CAA2F0">
that they need but little to excite them to it. An Indian war was a nece&s;&s;a|ry appendage of a war with France. The &s;cene of both was opened in Nova-Scotia.</P>
<P>That Province had been alternately claimed and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the Engli&s;h and French for more than a century. Ever &s;ince the peace of Utrecht it had been &s;ubject to the Crown of Britain, and the French inhabitants who were under a kind of patriarchal government of their prie&s;ts, and devoted to the French intere&s;t, were kept in awe, partly by the fear of having their dikes de&s;troyed, which they had erected to prevent the &s;ea from over|flowing their fields;<NOTE PLACE="marg">MS of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Morris.</NOTE> and partly by a Briti&s;h garri&s;on at Annapolis where a Governor and Council re&s;ided. The Indian tribes maintained their native independence, though they were attached to the French by religious, as well as intere&s;ted obliga|tions. Can&s;eau, an i&s;land on the northea&s;t|ern part of Nova-Scotia, was in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Engli&s;h. It was re&s;orted to by the fi&s;hermen of New-England. It was de|&s;ended by a block-hou&s;e and garri&s;oned by a detachment of troops from Annapo|lis. The i&s;land of Cape-Breton was po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed by the French, and lay between the Engli&s;h of Can&s;eau and tho&s;e of New|foundland.
<PB N="189" REF="023166_0188_0FBC80D859CEBC38">
This was too near a neigh|bourhood for enemies, e&s;pecially when both were pur&s;uing one object, the fi&s;hery.</P>
<P>The French at Cape-Berton having re|ceived early intelligence of the declaration of war;<NOTE PLACE="marg">March 15.</NOTE> immediately re&s;olved on the de|&s;truction of the Engli&s;h fi&s;hery at Can|&s;eau.

This was done, be|fore the news of war had arrived in New-England. It was followed by an attempt upon Placentia, in Newfoundland, which mi&s;carried. An attack was al&s;o made up|on Annapolis, the garri&s;on of which was reinforced by &s;everal companies of mili|tia and rangers from Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, and the enemy were obliged to retire. The Indians of Nova-Scotia a&s;&s;i&s;ted the French in this attack; which, with &s;ome other in&s;olencies committed by them, occa&s;ion|ed a declaration of war, by the govern|ment of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, again&s;t them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Oct 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Dougl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> I. 318.</NOTE> with a premium for &s;calps and pri&s;oners.</P>
<P>The&s;e proceedings of the French were ra&s;h and precipitate. They were not pre|pared for exten&s;ive operations; nor had

they any orders from their Court to under|take them. What they had done, &s;erved to irritate and alarm the neighbouring Eng|li&s;h Colonies, and &s;hew them their dan|ger in the mo&s;t con&s;picuous manner. Their &s;ea coa&s;t, navigation and fi&s;hery lay expo&s;ed to continual in&s;ults. Their fron|tier &s;ettlements on the we&s;tern &s;ide were but eighty miles di&s;tant from the French fort on Lake Champlain. The Indians who lay between them, had not yet taken up the hatchet; but it was expected that encou|ragement would be given them by the Governor of Canada, to in&s;ult the fron|tiers. Several new &s;ettlements were whol|ly broken up; and many of the women and children of other frontier places retir|ed to the old towns for &s;ecurity.</P>
<P>In the autumn, Duque&s;nel the French Governor of Cape-Breton, died, and was &s;ucceeded in the command by Ducham|bon,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prince and Dougla&s;s.</NOTE> who had not &s;o good a military cha|racter.

The

captive garri&s;on of Can&s;eau, with other pri&s;oners, who had been taken at &s;ea, and carried into Loui&s;burg, were &s;ent to Bo&s;|ton. From them, as well as from other informants, Governor Shirley obtained &s;uch intelligence of the &s;tate of that i&s;land and fortre&s;s, as induced him to form the project of attacking it. But before we open this romantic and hazardous &s;cene, it is nece&s;&s;ary to give &s;ome account of the place which was to be the theatre of op|erations.</P>
<P>The I&s;land of Cape-Breton, &s;o denomi|nated from one of its capes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Charlevoix</NOTE> lies between the forty-fifth and forty-&s;eventh degrees of north latitude; at the di&s;tance of fif|teen leagues from Cape Ray, the &s;outh-we&s;tern extremity of Newfoundland. It is &s;eparated from the main land of Nova-Scotia by a narrow &s;trait, &s;ix leagues in length, the navigation of which is &s;afe for a &s;hip of forty guns. The greate&s;t length of the i&s;land, from north-ea&s;t to &s;outh-we&s;t is about fifty leagues and its greate&s;t breadth thirty-three. It is about eighty-eight leagues in circuit as &s;eamen e&s;timate di&s;tances.<NOTE PLACE="marg">MS of S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r William Peppere<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&punc;</NOTE> Its general form is triangular, but it is indented by many deep bays.</P>
<P><PB N="192" REF="023166_0191_0FBC80DC85418520">The &s;oil of this i&s;land is by no mean<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> inviting.

Its atmo&s;phere in the &s;pring and &s;ummer is an almo&s;t continual fog, which prevents the rays of the &s;un from perfect|ing vegetation. Its winter is &s;evere and of long continuance; and as the i&s;land forms an eddy to the current which &s;ets through the gulf of St. Lawrence, its har|bours are filled with large quantities of floating ice,<NOTE PLACE="marg">State of Trade by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, p. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> 33.</NOTE> with which its &s;hores are in|vironed till late in the &s;pring.</P>
<P>Much has been &s;aid by French and Engli&s;h writers on the great importance and advantage of this i&s;land, and &s;ome political and temporary purpo&s;es were doubtle&s;s to be an&s;wered by &s;uch publica|tions; but in fact the only real import|ance of Cape-Breton was derived from its central &s;ituation, and the convenience of its ports. On the north and we&s;t &s;ides it is &s;teep and inacce&s;&s;ible; but the &s;outh-ea&s;tern &s;ide is full of fine bays and har|bours, capable of receiving and &s;ecuring &s;hips of any burden; and, being &s;ituated between Canada, France and the We&s;t-Indies,
<PB N="193" REF="023166_0192_0FBC80DDF585B8A0">
it was extremely favorable to the French commerce. It was not &s;o good a &s;tation for the fi&s;hery as &s;everal parts of Nova-Scotia and Newfoundland. The greater part of the French fi&s;hery was pro&s;ecuted el&s;ewhere;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hutchin|&s;on.</NOTE> and they could buy fi&s;h at Can&s;eau, cheaper than they could cure it at Cape-Breton.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t the French held po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the coa&s;ts of Nova-Scotia and Newfound|land, this i&s;land was neglected; but after they had ceded the&s;e places to the Crown of England, and the Crown of England had ceded this i&s;land to them by the trea|ty of Utrecht (1713) they began to &s;ee its value.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Charlevoix Dougla&s;s, R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lt, Prince.</NOTE> In&s;tead of giving &s;o much atten|tion to the fur trade of Canada, as they had before done, they contemplated build|ing a fortified town on this i&s;land, as a &s;ecurity to their navigation and fi&s;hery. For this purpo&s;e they cho&s;e a fine harbour on the &s;outh-ea&s;t &s;ide of the i&s;land, for|merly called Engli&s;h harbour; where they erected their fortifications, and called the place Loui&s;bourg.</P>
<P>The harbour of Loui&s;bourg lies in lati|tude 45&deg; 55&prime;; its entrance is about four hundred yards wide. The anchorage is uniformly &s;afe, and &s;hips may run a&s;hore on a &s;oft muddy bottom. The depth of
<PB N="194" REF="023166_0193_0FBC80DF71CC8900">
water at the entrance is from nine to twelve fathoms. The harbour lies open to the &s;outh-ea&s;t. Upon a neck of land on the &s;outh &s;ide of the harbour was built the town, two miles and a quarter in cir|cumference; fortified in every acce&s;&s;ible part with a rampart of &s;tone, from thirty to thirty-&s;ix feet high, and a ditch eighty feet wide.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Abbe Ray|nal.</NOTE> A &s;pace of about two hundred yards was left without a rampart, on the &s;ide next to the &s;ea; it was enclo&s;ed by a &s;imple dike and a line of pickets. The &s;ea was &s;o &s;hallow in this place that it made only a narrow channel, inacce&s;&s;ible from its numerous reefs to any &s;hipping whatever. The &s;ide fire from the ba&s;tions &s;ecured this &s;pot from an attack. There were &s;ix ba&s;tions and three batteries, con|taining embra&s;ures for one hundred and forty-eight cannon, of which &s;ixty-five only were mounted, and &s;ixteen mortars. On an i&s;land at the entrance of the har|bour was planted a battery of thirty can|non, carrying twenty-eight pounds &s;hot; and at the bottom of the harbour, directly oppo&s;ite to the entrance, was the grand or royal battery of twenty-eight cannon, forty-two pounders, and two eighteen pounders.

and within this point, at the north-ea&s;t part of the harbour, was a careening wharf &s;ecure from all winds, and a magazine of naval &s;tores.</P>
<P>The town was regularly laid out in &s;quares. The &s;treets were broad; the hou&s;es mo&s;tly of wood, but &s;ome of &s;tone. On the we&s;t &s;ide, near the rampart, was a &s;pacious citadel, and a large parade; on one &s;ide of which were the Gover|nor's apartments. Under the rampart were ca&s;emates to receive the women and children during a &s;iege. The entrance of the town on the land &s;ide was at the we&s;t gate, over a draw bridge, near to which was a circular battery, mounting &s;ixteen guns of twenty-four pounds &s;hot.</P>
<P>The&s;e works had been twenty-five years in building; and though not fini&s;hed, had co&s;t the Crown not le&s;s than thirty mil|lions of livres. The place was &s;o &s;trong as to be called 'the Dunkirk of America.' It was, in peace, a &s;afe retreat for the &s;hips of France bound homeward from the Ea&s;t and We&s;t-Indies; and in war, a &s;ource of di&s;tre&s;s to the northern Engli&s;h Colonies; its &s;ituation being extremely favorable for privateers to ruin their fi&s;hery and inter|rupt their coa&s;ting and foreign trade; for which rea&s;ons, the reduction of it was an

Thus early did Shirley conceive and communicate to Wentworth his great de&s;ign; and the mo&s;t prudent &s;tep which he took in this whole affair was to &s;olicit help from England. His petition, &s;upported by that worthy officer,<NOTE PLACE="marg">MS copy of D.

with Governor Shirley. Orders of the &s;ame date were written to Shirley, inclo&s;ed to Warren, directing him to a&s;|&s;i&s;t the King's &s;hips with tran&s;ports, men and provi&s;ions. The&s;e orders, though ex|tremely favorable to the de&s;ign, were to|tally unknown in New-England, till the middle of April following, before which time the expedition was completely form|ed.</P>
<P>It has been &s;aid, that a plan of this fam|ous enterpri&s;e,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dougla&s;s, Bollan, Hutchin|&s;on.</NOTE> was fir&s;t &s;ugge&s;ted by Wil|liam Vaughan, a &s;on of Lieutenant Gov|ernor Vaughan of New-Hamp&s;hire. Seve|ral other per&s;ons have claimed the like merit. How far each one's information or advice, contributed toward forming the de&s;ign, cannot now be determined. Vaughan was largely concerned in the fi&s;hery on the ea&s;tern coa&s;t of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts. He was a man of good under&s;tanding, but of a daring, enterpri&s;ing and tenacious mind, and one who thought of no ob&s;tacles to the accompli&s;hment of his views. An in|&s;tance of his temerity is &s;till remembered. He had equipped, at Port&s;mouth, a num|ber of boats to carry on his fi&s;hery at Montinicus. On the day appointed for failing, in the month of March, though the wind was &s;o boi&s;terous that experien|ced

One was lo&s;t at the mouth of the river, the re&s;t arrived with much difficulty, but in a &s;hort time, at the place of their de&s;tina|tion. Vaughan had not been at Loui&s;|burg; but had learned from fi&s;hermen and others, &s;omething of the &s;trength and &s;ituation of the place; and nothing being in his view impracticable, which he had a mind to accompli&s;h, he conceived a de|&s;ign to take the city by &s;urpri&s;e; and even propo&s;ed going over the walls in the win|ter on the drifts of &s;now. This idea of a &s;urpri&s;al forcibly &s;truck the mind of Shir|ley, and prevailed with him to ha&s;ten his preparations, before he could have any an&s;wer or orders from England.</P>
<P>In the beginning of January he reque&s;t|ed of the members of the General Court,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1745.</NOTE> that they would lay them&s;elves under an oath of &s;ecre&s;y, to receive a propo&s;al from him, of very great importance. This was the fir&s;t reque&s;t of the kind which had ever been made to a legi&s;lative body in the Colonies. They readily took the oath, and he communicated to them the plan which he had formed of attacking Loui&s;|bourg. The &s;ecret was kept for &s;ome days;

the Governor to i&s;&s;ue a proclamation for inli&s;ting two hundred and fifty men, at twenty-five &s;hillings per month, one month's pay to be advanced; they al&s;o recommended that military &s;tores and tran&s;ports &s;hould be provided, and that &s;uch preparations &s;hould be made as that the whole might be ready by the begin|ning of March.

<P>During this tedious interval, a report was &s;pread, that the Hou&s;e had refu&s;ed to rai&s;e men and money for the expedition; and the author of the report was &s;ought out and called to account by the Hou&s;e for his mi&s;behaviour.

<P>The per&s;on appointed to command the expedition was WILLIAM PEPPERRELL, E&s;q. of Kittery, Colonel of a regiment of militia; a merchant of unblemi&s;hed re|putation and engaging manners, exten|&s;ively known both in Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts and New-Hamp&s;hire, and very popular. The&s;e qualities were ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary in the Commander of an army of volunteers, his own countrymen, who were to quit their dome&s;tic connexions and employments, and engage in a hazardous enterpri&s;e, which none of them, from the highe&s;t to

the lowe&s;t, knew how to conduct. Pro|fe&s;&s;ional &s;kill and experience were entirely out of the que&s;tion; had the&s;e qualities been nece&s;&s;ary, the expedition mu&s;t have been laid a&s;ide; for there was no per&s;on in New-England, in the&s;e re&s;pects quali|fied for the command. Fidelity, re&s;olu|tion and popularity mu&s;t &s;upply the place of military talents; and Pepperrell was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the&s;e. It was nece&s;&s;ary that the men &s;hould know and love their Gene|ral, or they would not inli&s;t under him.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The following private note was &s;ent from Bo&s;ton to Pepperrell, whil&s;t at Loui&s;bourg, and found among his papers.</P>
<P><Q>You was made General, being a popular man, mo&s;t likely to rai&s;e &s;oldiers &s;oone&s;t. The expedition was calculated to ESTABLISH Sh&mdash;, and make his creature W.

Beware of &s;nakes in the gra&s;s, and mark their hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ing.</Q></P></NOTE></P>
<P>After this appointment was made,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Shirley's private let|ters. MS.</NOTE> and while it was uncertain whether the A&s;&s;em|bly of New-Hamp&s;hire would agree with the Governor in rai&s;ing money for the expedition, Shirley propo&s;ed to Went|worth, the rai&s;ing of men in New-Hamp|&s;hire, to be in the pay of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, and in the letter which he wrote on that occa&s;ion paid him the following compli|ment.
<Q>It would have been an infinite &s;at|isfaction to me, and done great honor to
<PB N="204" REF="023166_0203_0FBC80F4C2961818">
the expedition, if your limbs would have permitted you to take the chief command.</Q>
Wentworth was charmed with the idea, and forgetting his gout, made an offer of his per&s;onal &s;ervice; but not till after the A&s;&s;embly had agreed to his terms and the money bill was pa&s;&s;ed. Shirley was then obliged to an&s;wer him thus.
<Q>Upon com|municating your offer to two or three gentlemen, in who&s;e prudence and judg|ment I mo&s;t confide, I found them clear|ly of opinion, that any alteration of the pre&s;ent command would be attended with great ri&s;que, both with re&s;pect to the A&s;&s;embly and the &s;oldiers being en|tirely di&s;gu&s;ted.</Q></P>
<P>Before Pepperrell accepted the com|mand, he a&s;ked the opinion of the famous George Whitefield, who was then itinerat|ing and preaching in New-England. Whitefield told him, that he did not think the &s;cheme very promi&s;ing;<NOTE PLACE="marg">White|field's let|ters, No. 572.</NOTE> that the eyes of all would be on him; that if it &s;hould not &s;ucceed, the widows and or|phans of the &s;lain would reproach him; and if it &s;hould &s;ucceed, many would re|gard him with envy, and endeavor to eclip&s;e his glory; that he ought therefore to go with 'a &s;ingle eye,' and then he
<PB N="205" REF="023166_0204_0FBC80F5F5F10178">
would find his &s;trength proportioned to his nece&s;&s;ity. Henry Sherburne, the Com|mi&s;&s;ary of New-Hamp&s;hire, another of Whitefield's friends, pre&s;&s;ed him to favor the expedition and give a motto for the flag; to which, after &s;ome he&s;itation, he con&s;ented. The motto was,
<Q>Nil de&s;pe|randum Chri&s;to duce.</Q>
This gave the ex|pedition the air of a cru&s;ade, and many of his followers inli&s;ted. One of them, a Chaplain, carried on his &s;houlder a hatch|et, with which he intended to de&s;troy the images in the French churches.</P>
<P>There are certain latent &s;parks in hu|man nature, which, by a colli&s;ion of cau&s;|es, are &s;ometimes brought to light; and when once excited, their operations are not ea&s;ily controled. In undertaking any thing hazardous, there is a nece&s;&s;ity for extraordinary vigor of mind, and a degree of confidence and fortitude, which &s;hall rai&s;e us above the dread of danger, and di&s;po&s;e us to run a ri&s;que which the cold maxims of prudence would forbid. The people of New-England have at various times &s;hewn &s;uch an enthu&s;ia&s;tic ardor, which has been excited by the example of their ance&s;tors and their own expo&s;ed &s;itu|ation. It was never more apparent, and perhaps never more nece&s;&s;ary, than on oc|ca&s;ion
<PB N="206" REF="023166_0205_0FBC80F773125B28">
of this expedition. Nor ought it to be forgotten, that &s;everal circum&s;tances, which did not depend on human fore&s;ight, greatly favored this undertaking.</P>
<P>The winters in this country are often &s;e|vere; but the winter in which this expedition was planned, and particularly the month of February, was very mild. The har|bours and rivers were open, and the weath|er was in general &s;o plea&s;ant, that every kind of labor could be done abroad. The fruitfulne&s;s of the preceding &s;ea&s;on had made provi&s;ions plenty. The Indians had not yet mole&s;ted the frontiers; and though &s;ome of them had heard that an expedition again&s;t Cape Breton was in hand, and carried the news of it to Cana|da, &s;uch an attempt was &s;o improbable, that the French gave no credit to the re|port, and tho&s;e in Nova-Scotia did not re|ceive the lea&s;t intelligence of the prepara|tions.

continent and i&s;lands, till they made a formidable naval force, con&s;i&s;ting of four &s;hips of the line and &s;ix frigates, un|der the command of an active, judicious and experienced officer. On the other hand, the garri&s;on of Loui&s;bourg was di&s;content|ed and mutinous; they were in want of provi&s;ions and &s;tores; they had no know|ledge of the de&s;ign formed again&s;t them; their &s;hores were &s;o environed with ice, that no &s;upplies could arrive early from France, and tho&s;e which came afterward, were intercepted and taken by our crui&s;|ers. In &s;hort,

<P>In the undertaking and pro&s;ecuting of an enterpri&s;e &s;o novel to the people of New-England, it is amu&s;ing to &s;ee how many projects were invented; what a variety of advice was given from all quarters, and what romantic expectations were formed by advi&s;ers and adventurers. Dur|ing the inli&s;tment, one of the officers was heard to &s;ay with great &s;obriety, that he intended to carry with him three &s;hirts, one of which &s;hould be ruffled, becau&s;e he expected that the General would give
<PB N="208" REF="023166_0207_0FBC80FA7965CD48">
him the command of the city, when it &s;hould be taken. An ingenious and be|nevolent clergyman, pre&s;ented to the Gene|ral a plan for the incampment of the ar|my, the opening of trenches and the plac|ing of batteries before the city.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Private MS letters.</NOTE> To pre|vent danger to the troops from &s;ubterra|neous mines, he propo&s;ed, that two con|fidential per&s;ons, attended by a guard, &s;hould, during the night, approach the walls; that one &s;hould with a beetle &s;trike the ground, while the other &s;hould lay his ear to it, and ob&s;erve whether the &s;ound was hollow, and that a mark &s;hould be &s;et on all places &s;u&s;pected. Another gen|tleman, of equal ingenuity, &s;ent the Gen|eral a model of a flying bridge, to be u&s;ed in &s;caling the walls of Loui&s;bourg. It was &s;o light, that twenty men could carry it on their &s;houlders to the wall, and rai&s;e it in one minute. The apparatus for rai&s;ing it con&s;i&s;ted of four blocks, and two hundred fathoms of rope. It was to be floored with boards, wide enough for eight men to march abrea&s;t; and to prevent danger from the enemy's fire, it might be covered with raw hides. This bridge, it was &s;aid, might be erected again&s;t any part of the wall, even where no breach had
<PB N="209" REF="023166_0208_0FBC80FE67F37A60">
been made; and it was &s;uppo&s;ed that a thou&s;and men might pa&s;s over it in four minutes.</P>
<P>But the mo&s;t extraordinary project of all, was Shirley's &s;cheme for taking the city by &s;urpri&s;e, in the fir&s;t night after the arrival of the troops, and before any Brit|i&s;h naval force could po&s;&s;ibly come to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance. It is thus delineated in a con|fidential letter which he wrote to Went|worth, when he urged him to &s;end the New-Hamp&s;hire troops to Bo&s;ton, to pro|ceed thence with the fleet of tran&s;ports.
<Q>The &s;ucce&s;s of our &s;cheme for &s;urpri&s;ing Loui&s;bourg will entirely depend on the execution of the fir&s;t night,<NOTE PLACE="marg">March 2.</NOTE> after the ar|rival of our forces. For this purpo&s;e it is nece&s;&s;ary, that the whole fleet &s;hould make Chappeau-rouge point ju&s;t at the &s;hutting in of the day, when they can|not ea&s;ily be di&s;covered, and from thence pu&s;h into the bay, &s;o as to have all the men landed before midnight; (the land|ing of whom, it is computed by Capt. Durell and Mr. Ba&s;tide, will take up three hours at lea&s;t.) After which, the forming of the four &s;everal corps, to be employed in attempting to &s;cale the walls of Loui&s;bourg, near the ea&s;t gate, front|ing the &s;ea, and the we&s;t gate, fronting
<PB N="210" REF="023166_0209_0FBC80FFFB490C38">
the harbour; to cover the retreat of the two beforementioned parties in ca&s;e of a repul&s;e; and, to attack the grand bat|tery; (which attack mu&s;t be made at the &s;ame time with the two other at|tacks) will take up two hours more at lea&s;t. After the&s;e four bodies are form|ed, their march to their re&s;pective po&s;ts from whence they are to make their at|tacks and &s;erve as a cover to the retreat, will take up another two hours; which, &s;uppo&s;ing the tran&s;ports to arrive in Chap|peau-rouge bay at nine o'clock in the evening, and not before, as it will be nece&s;&s;ary for them to do, in order to land and march under cover of the night, will bring them to four in the morning, being day break, before they begin the attack, which will be full late for them to begin. Your Excellency will from hence perceive how critical an affair, the time of the fleet's arrival in Chappeau|rouge bay is, and how nece&s;&s;ary it is to the &s;ucce&s;s of our principal &s;cheme, that the fleet &s;hould arrive there, in a body, at that preci&s;e hour.</Q></P>
<P>It is ea&s;y to perceive that this plan was contrived by a per&s;on totally un&s;killed in the arts of navigation and of war. The coa&s;t of Cape-Breton was dangerous and
<PB N="211" REF="023166_0210_0FBC810145DB63C0">
inho&s;pitable, the &s;ea&s;on of the year rough and tempe&s;tuous, and the air a continual fog; yet, a fleet of an hundred ve&s;&s;els, after &s;ailing nearly two hundred leagues (for by this plan they were not to &s;top) mu&s;t make a certain point of land 'at a preci&s;e hour,' and enter an unknown bay, in an evening. The troops were to land in the dark, amid&s;t a violent &s;urf, on a rocky &s;hore; to march through a thicket and bog three miles, to the city, and &s;ome of them a mile beyond it to the royal bat|tery. Men who had never been in action, were to perform &s;ervices, which the mo&s;t experienced veteran would think of with dread; to pull down pickets with grap|ling irons, and &s;cale the walls of a regular fortification, with ladders, which were af|terward found to be too &s;hort by ten feet; all in the &s;pace of twelve hours from their fir&s;t making the land, and nine hours from their debarkation. This part of the plan was prudently concealed from the troops.</P>
<P>The forces which New-Hamp&s;hire fur|ni&s;hed for this expedition, were three hun|dred and fifty men, including the crew of an armed &s;loop which convoyed the tran&s;ports and &s;erved as a crui&s;er. They were formed into a regiment, con&s;i&s;ting
<PB N="212" REF="023166_0211_0FBC8102B6134EB8">
of eight companies, and were under the command of Col. Samuel Moore. The &s;loop was commanded by Capt. John Fernald; her crew con&s;i&s;ted of thirty men. The regiment, &s;loop and tran&s;ports, were, by Governor Wentworth's written in|&s;tructions to the General, put under his command. Be&s;ides the&s;e, a body of one hundred and fifty men was inli&s;ted in New-Hamp&s;hire and aggregated to the regiment in the pay of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts. Thus New-Hamp&s;hire employed five hun|dred men; about one eighth part of the whole land force.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the introductory part of Dr. Ram&s;ey's elegant hi&s;tory of the American Revolution (page 34) it is &s;aid, that

This is not &s;ufficiently accurate. It originated in Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts; but the Colonies of New-Hamp&s;hire, Rhode-I&s;land and Connecticut, by their legi&s;lative authority, furni&s;hed troops and &s;tores.

He was ordered to pro|ceed to Can&s;eau, there to build a block-hou&s;e and battery, and leave two compa|nies in garri&s;on, and to depo&s;it the &s;tores which might not immediately be wanted by the army.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Original in&s;truc|tions, in MS.</NOTE> Thence he was to &s;end a detachment to the village of St. Peters, on the i&s;land of Cape-Breton and de&s;troy it; to <HI>prevent</HI> any intelligence which might be carried to Loui&s;bourg; for which pur|po&s;e al&s;o, the armed ve&s;&s;els were to crui&s;e before the harbour. The whole fleet was to &s;ail from Can&s;eau, &s;o as to arrive in Chappeau-rouge bay about nine o'clock in the evening. The troops were to land in four divi&s;ions, and proceed to the a&s;|&s;ault before morning. If the plan for the &s;urpri&s;al &s;hould fail, he had particular di|rections where and how to land, march, encamp, attack and defend; to hold coun|cils and keep records; and to &s;end intel|ligence to Bo&s;ton by certain ve&s;&s;els retain|ed for the purpo&s;e, which ve&s;&s;els were to &s;top at Ca&s;tle William, and there receive the Governor's orders.

and the camp, to convey orders, tran&s;|port &s;tores, and <HI>catch fi&s;h</HI> for the army. To clo&s;e the&s;e in&s;tructions, after the mo&s;t minute detail of duty, the General was finally
<Q>left to act upon unfore&s;een emer|gencies according to his di&s;cretion;</Q>
which, in the opinion of military gentle|men, is accounted the mo&s;t rational part of the whole. Such was the plan, for the reduction of a regularly con&s;tructed fortre&s;s, drawn by a lawyer, to be execut|ed by a merchant, at the head of a body of hu&s;bandmen and mechanics; animated indeed by ardent patrioti&s;m, but de&s;titute of profe&s;&s;ional &s;kill and experience.

<P>The troops were detained at Can&s;eau, three weeks, waiting for the ice which in|vironed the i&s;land of Cape-Breton, to be di&s;&s;olved. They were all this time with|in view of St. Peters,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pepperell's letters to Shirley, MS.</NOTE> but were not di&s;cov|ered. Their provi&s;ions became &s;hort; but they were &s;upplied by prizes taken by the crui&s;ers.

The &s;moke of this fire being driven by the wind into the grand battery, &s;o terrified the French, that they abandoned it and retired to the city, after having &s;piked the guns and cut the halliards of the flag-&s;taff.

But Vaughan, with his &s;mall party, on the naked beach, and in the face of a &s;mart fire from the city and the boats, kept them from landing, till the reinforcement arrived. In every duty of fatigue or &s;anguine adventure, he was always ready; and the New-Hamp&s;hire troops, animated by the &s;ame enthu&s;ia&s;tic ardor, partook of all the labors and dan|gers of the &s;iege.

<P>In the unfortunate attempt on the i&s;land battery by four hundred volunteers from different regiments,<NOTE PLACE="marg">May 26.</NOTE> the New-Hamp&s;hire troops were very active.

The ground was &s;o uneven and the people &s;o &s;cattered, that the French could form no e&s;timate of their numbers; nor could they learn it from the pri&s;oners, taken at the i&s;land battery, who on their examination, as if by previous agreement, repre&s;ented the number to be va&s;tly greater than it was. The garri&s;on of Loui&s;bourg had been &s;o mutinous before the &s;iege, that the officers could not tru&s;t the men to make a &s;ortie, le&s;t they &s;hould de&s;ert; had they been united and acted with vigor, the camp might have been &s;urpri&s;ed and ma|ny of the people de&s;troyed.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XX. Projected Expedition to Canada. Alarm by the French fleet. State of the Frontiers. Peace.</HEAD>
<P>WHILST the expedition to Cape-Bre|ton was in hand, the active mind of Governor Shirley contemplated nothing le&s;s than the conque&s;t of all the French dominions in America; and he con&s;ulted with Governor Wentworth and Mr. At|kin&s;on on the practicability of &s;uch a de|&s;ign. After Loui&s;bourg was taken, he made a vi&s;it thither, and held a con&s;ulta|tion with Sir Peter Warren and Sir Willi|am Pepperell;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Shirley's MS letters.</NOTE> and from that place wrote pre&s;&s;ingly to the Briti&s;h mini&s;try on the &s;ubject. His &s;olicitation, enforced by the brilliant &s;ucce&s;s at Loui&s;bourg, and the apparent danger in which Nova-Scotia and the new conque&s;t were involved, had &s;uch an effect, that in the &s;pring of the following year,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1746.</NOTE> a circular letter was &s;ent from the Duke of Newca&s;tle,<NOTE PLACE="marg">April 6.</NOTE> Secretary of State, to all the Governors of the Ameri|can Colonies, as far &s;outhward as Virgi|nia; requiring them to rai&s;e as many men

as they could &s;pare, and form them into companies of one hundred; to be ready to unite,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dougla&s;s I, 315.</NOTE> and act according to the orders which they &s;hould afterwards receive. The plan was, that a &s;quadron of &s;hips of war, and a body of land forces, &s;hould be &s;ent from England again&s;t Canada; that the troops rai&s;ed in New-England &s;hould join the Briti&s;h fleet and army at Loui&s;bourg, and proceed up the river St. Lawrence; that tho&s;e of New-York and the other Provinces at the &s;outhward, &s;hould be collected at Albany, and march again&s;t Crown Point and Montreal. The man|agement of this expedition was committed to Sir John St. Clair, in conjunction with Sir Peter Warren and Governor Shirley. St. Clair did not come to America. War|ren and Shirley gave the orders, while Warren was here; and afterward Com|modore Knowles, who &s;ucceeded him, was joined with Shirley; but as Knowles was part of the time at Loui&s;bourg, mo&s;t of the concern devolved on Shirley alone.</P>
<P>Be&s;ide the danger of lo&s;ing Nova-Sco|tia and Cape-Breton, there were other rea|&s;ons for undertaking this expedition. The Indians, in&s;tigated by the Governor of Canada,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Shirley's &s;p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ech.</NOTE> were ravaging the frontiers, de&s;|troying the fields and cattle,<NOTE PLACE="marg">June 28.</NOTE> burning

hou&s;es and mills, killing and carrying away the inhabitants. Though &s;couts and garri&s;ons were maintained by the govern|ments; yet to act altogether on the defen|&s;ive, was thought to be not only an inef|fectual, but a di&s;graceful mode of carry|ing on the war; e&s;pecially after the &s;ucce&s;s which had attended the arms of the Colo|ni&s;ts in their attempt again&s;t Loui&s;bourg. The continuance of &s;uch a mode of de|fence, would neither di&s;pirit the enemy, nor &s;ecure the frontiers from their depre|dations.</P>
<P>The de&s;ign was plea&s;ing, and the Colo|nies readily furni&s;hed their quotas of men. In New-Hamp&s;hire, the &s;ame difficulty occurred as on occa&s;ion of the Loui&s;bourg expedition. The Governor had no au|thority to con&s;ent to the emi&s;&s;ion of bills of credit,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Shirley's MS letters,</NOTE> <NOTE PLACE="marg">May 31.</NOTE> but Shirley removed that ob&s;ta|cle, by &s;ugge&s;ting to him, that as the mini&s;try did not di&s;approve what he had done before, &s;o there was no rea&s;on to fear it now; and that the importance of the &s;ervice, and the nece&s;&s;ity of the ca&s;e, would ju&s;tify his conduct. The demand at fir&s;t, was for levy money and victualing. The arms and pay of the troops were to be furni&s;hed by the Crown; but it was afterward found nece&s;&s;ary that the &s;eve|ral
<PB N="228" REF="023166_0227_0FBC811FF742F130">
governments &s;hould provide clothing, tran&s;ports and &s;tores, and depend on a reimbur&s;ement from the Briti&s;h Parlia|ment.</P>
<P>The A&s;&s;embly was immediately con|vened, and voted an encouragement for in|li&s;ting a thou&s;and men,<NOTE PLACE="marg">June.</NOTE> or more, if they could be rai&s;ed; with a bounty of thirty pounds currency, and a blanket, to each man, be&s;ides keeping two armed ve&s;&s;els in pay.

The &s;ea&s;on was &s;o far advanced,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Shirley's &amp; Warren's MS letters.</NOTE> that a fleet could hardly be ex|pected from England;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Augu&s;t 25.</NOTE> or if it &s;hould ar|rive, it would be too late to attempt the navigation of the river St. Lawrence.

At the &s;ame time, Clinton, Governor of New-York, &s;olicited and obtained the friendly a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Six Nations of Indians, on the borders of his Province. It was thought, that if this attempt &s;hould be made, the alliance with the&s;e Indians would be &s;trengthened and &s;ecured; and the frontiers would be relieved from the horrors of de&s;olation and captivity, to which they were continually expo&s;ed. In pur&s;uance of this plan, the forces of New-Hamp&s;hire were ordered to hold them|&s;elves in readine&s;s, to march to Albany;<NOTE PLACE="marg">MS letter of Secreta|ry Willard.</NOTE> but,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sept. 1.</NOTE> it being di&s;covered that the &s;mall-pox

<P>No &s;ooner was this plan re&s;olved on, and preparations made to carry it into ex|ecution, than accounts were received of danger which threatened Annapolis, from a body of French and Indians at Minas,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Shirley's &amp; Warren's MS letters,</NOTE> and the probable revolt of the Acadians. It was thought that Nova-Scotia would be lo&s;t,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sept. 12.</NOTE> if &s;ome powerful &s;uccour were not &s;ent thither. Orders were according|ly i&s;&s;ued, for the troops of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, Rhode-I&s;land and New-Hamp&s;hire, to embark for that place, and
<Q>drive the en|emy out of Nova-Scotia.</Q>
But, within a few days more, the whole country was alarmed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sept. 20.</NOTE> and thrown into the utmo&s;t con|&s;ternation, by reports of the arrival of a large fleet and army from France, at Nova-Scotia, under the command of the Duke D'Anville. It was &s;uppo&s;ed that their object was to recover Loui&s;bourg; to take Annapolis; to break up the &s;ettle|ments on the ea&s;tern coa&s;t of Ma&s;&s;achu|&s;etts; and to di&s;tre&s;s, if not attempt the conque&s;t of the whole country of New-England. On this occa&s;ion, the troops de&s;tined for Canada found &s;ufficient em|ployment at home, and the militia was collected to join them; the old forts on

the &s;ea coa&s;t were repaired, and new ones were erected. A new battery, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;ixteen guns, of thirty-two and twenty-four pounds &s;hot, was added to fort Wil|liam and Mary, at the entrance of Pa&s;cat|aqua harbour; and another, of nine thir|ty-two pounders, was placed at the point of Little Harbour. The&s;e works were &s;up|po&s;ed to be &s;ufficient to prevent a &s;urpri&s;al. Military guards were appointed; and in this &s;tate of fear and anxiety, the people were kept for &s;ix weeks, when &s;ome pri&s;oners,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Oct. 25.</NOTE> who had been relea&s;ed by the French, brought the mo&s;t affecting accounts of the di&s;tre&s;s and confu&s;ion on board the fleet. It was expected, by the people in New-England, that an Engli&s;h fleet would have followed them to America. This expectation was grounded on &s;ome letters from England, which Shirley had received and which he forwarded by expre&s;s to Admiral Town&s;|end, at Loui&s;bourg. The letters were intercepted by a French crui&s;er, and carri|ed into Chebucto, where the fleet lay. They were opened in a Council of War, and cau&s;ed a divi&s;ion among the officers; which, added to the &s;ickly condition of the men, and the damage which the fleet had &s;u&s;tained by &s;torms, and their lo&s;s by &s;hipwrecks, dejected their commander to

that degree, that he put an end to his life by poi&s;on; and the &s;econd in command fell on his &s;word. The&s;e melancholy events, di&s;concerted their fir&s;t plan. They then re&s;olved to make an attempt on An|napolis; but when they had &s;ailed from Chebucto, they were overtaken by a vio|lent tempe&s;t, off Cape Sable; and tho&s;e &s;hips which e&s;caped de&s;truction, returned &s;ingly to France. Never was the hand of divine Providence more vi&s;ible, than on this occa&s;ion. Never was a di&s;appoint|ment more &s;evere, on the &s;ide of the ene|my; nor a deliverance more complete, without human help, in favor of this country.</P>
<P>Nova-Scotia was not yet out of danger. The French and Indians, who, during the &s;tay of the fleet at Chebucto, had appear|ed before Annapolis, but on their depar|ture retired, were &s;till in the penin&s;ula; and it was thought nece&s;&s;ary to di&s;lodge them. For this purpo&s;e Shirley &s;ent a body of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts forces, and pre&s;&s;ed the Governors of Rhode-I&s;land and New-Hamp&s;hire to &s;end part of theirs.

<P>When the alarm occa&s;ioned by the French fleet had &s;ub&s;ided, Atkin&s;on's regi|ment marched into the country to cover the lower part of the frontiers, and en|camped near the &s;hore of Winipi&s;eogee lake; where they pa&s;&s;ed the winter and

<P>Shirley was &s;o intent on attacking Crown Point that he even propo&s;ed to march thither in the winter,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Shirley's MS letters.</NOTE> and had the addre&s;s to draw the A&s;&s;embly of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts into an approbation of this project. He enlarged his plan, by propo&s;ing that the New-Hamp&s;hire troops &s;hould at the &s;ame time go, by the way of Connecticut river, to the Indian village of St. Francis, at the di&s;tance of two hundred miles, and de&s;troy it; while the troops from Ma&s;&s;a|chu&s;etts, Connecticut and New-York, &s;hould go by the way of the Lakes to Crown Point. The Governor of New-York would have con&s;ented to this wild projection, on account of the Indian allies, who were impatient for war; but it was happily fru&s;trated,<NOTE PLACE="marg">MS copy of Connec|ticut Re|&s;olves.</NOTE> by the prudence of the Connecticut A&s;&s;embly;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jan. 28.</NOTE> who deemed the winter an improper &s;ea&s;on for &s;o great an

undertaking, and deferred their a&s;&s;i&s;tance till the en&s;uing &s;pring. At the &s;ame time the &s;mall pox prevailed in the &s;ettle|ments above Albany, through which the forces mu&s;t have marched; and that di&s;|temper was then an object of much greater dread, than the &s;torms of winter, or the face of an enemy.</P>
<P>To fini&s;h what relates to the Canada forces, it can only be &s;aid, that excepting &s;ome who were employed on the frontiers, they were kept in a &s;tate of military indo|lence, till the autumn of the en&s;uing year;<NOTE PLACE="marg">October, 1747.</NOTE> when by order from the Duke of New|ca&s;tle they were di&s;banded, and paid at the &s;ame rate as the King's troops. The Governors drew bills on the Briti&s;h trea|&s;ury; which were negociated among the merchants at &s;even and eight hundred per cent. and the Parliament granted money,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Shirley's MS letters.</NOTE> to reimbur&s;e the charges of the equipment and &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of the&s;e forces.</P>

&s;ide of Connecticut river, and within the lately extended line of New-Hamp&s;hire. This fort had been erected and main|tained, at the expen&s;e of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts; but when it was found to be within New-Hamp&s;hire, the Governor was in&s;tructed by the Crown to recommend to the A&s;|&s;embly, the future maintenance of it. In the &s;ame A&s;&s;embly, which had &s;o zealou&s;ly entered upon the expedition again&s;t Cape Breton, this matter was in|troduced; but a con&s;iderable majority of the lower Hou&s;e declined making any grant for this purpo&s;e,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Printed Journal,</NOTE> <NOTE PLACE="marg">May 3.</NOTE> and adduced the following rea&s;ons, viz. That the fort was fifty miles di&s;tant from any towns which had been &s;ettled by the government or people of New-Hamp&s;hire; that the people had no right to the lands which, by the dividing line, had fallen within New-Hamp&s;hire; notwith&s;tanding the plau&s;ible arguments which had been u&s;ed to induce them to bear the expen&s;e of the line; namely, that the land would be giv|en to them or el&s;e would be &s;old to pay that expen&s;e; that the charge of main|taining that fort, at &s;o great a di&s;tance, and to which there was no communication by roads, would exceed what had been the whole expen&s;e of government before the
<PB N="237" REF="023166_0236_0FBC81385C817C40">
line was e&s;tabli&s;hed; that the great load of debt contracted on that account, and the yearly &s;upport of government, with the unavoidable expen&s;es of the war, were as much as the people could bear; that if they &s;hould take upon them to main|tain this fort, there was another much better and more convenient fort at a place called Number-four, be&s;ides &s;everal other &s;ettlements, which they &s;hould al&s;o be obliged to defend; and finally that there was no danger that the&s;e forts would want &s;upport, &s;ince it was the intere&s;t of Ma&s;|&s;achu&s;etts, by whom they were erected, to maintain them as a cover to their frontier.</P>
<P>When the&s;e rea&s;ons were given, the Governor di&s;&s;olved the A&s;&s;embly and call|ed another, to whom he recommended the &s;ame mea&s;ure in the mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ing terms; telling them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">June 7.</NOTE>
<Q>that it was of the la&s;t con&s;equence to the pre&s;ent and fu|ture pro&s;perity of the government; that their refu&s;al would le&s;&s;en them in the e&s;|teem of the King and his mini&s;ters, and &s;trip the children yet unborn of their natural right; and deprive their brethren who were then hazarding their lives be|fore the walls of Loui&s;bourg of their ju&s;t expectations, which were to &s;it down on that valuable part of the Province.</Q>
But his eloquence had no effect. They
<PB N="238" REF="023166_0237_0FBC8139804C7E08">
thought it unju&s;t to burden their Con&s;ti|tuents with an expen&s;e which could yield them no profit, and afford them no pro|tection.</P>
<P>When it was determined, that New-Hamp&s;hire would make no provi&s;ion for fort Dummer, the A&s;&s;embly of Ma&s;&s;achu|&s;etts continued its u&s;ual &s;upport, and al&s;o provided for the other po&s;ts on Connecti|cut river and its branches, which were within the limits of New-Hamp&s;hire. They afterwards petitioned the King, to deduct that charge out of the reimbur&s;e|ment, which the Parliament had granted to New-Hamp&s;hire, for the Canada expe|dition; but in this they were defeated, by the vigilance and addre&s;s of Thomlin&s;on, the agent of New-Hamp&s;hire.</P>

<P>Be&s;ides the forts which were maintain|ed at the public expen&s;e, there were pri|vate hou&s;es enclo&s;ed with ramparts, or pali&s;ades of timber; to which the peo|ple who remained on the frontiers retired; the&s;e private garri&s;oned hou&s;es were di&s;|&s;tingui&s;hed by the names of the owners. The danger to which the&s;e di&s;tre&s;&s;ed peo|ple were con&s;tantly expo&s;ed, did not per|mit them to cultivate their lands to any advantage. They were frequently alarm|ed when at labor in their fields, and oblig|ed either to repel an attack, or make a retreat. Their crops were often injured, and &s;ometimes de&s;troyed, either by their cattle getting into the fields where the en|emy had broken the fences, or becau&s;e they were afraid to venture out, to collect and &s;ecure the harve&s;t.

hor&s;es were frequently killed by the ene|my; who cut the fle&s;h from the bones, and took out the tongues, which they pre|&s;erved for food, by drying in &s;moke. Some|times they were afraid even to milk their cows; though they kept them in pa&s;tures as near as po&s;&s;ible to the forts. When they went abroad, they were always arm|ed; but frequently they were &s;hut up for weeks together in a &s;tate of inactivity.</P>
<P>The hi&s;tory of a war on the frontiers can be little el&s;e than a recital of the ex|ploits, the &s;ufferings, the e&s;capes and de|liverances of individuals, of &s;ingle families or &s;mall parties.<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 5.</NOTE> The fir&s;t appearance of the enemy on the we&s;tern frontier was at the Great Meadow,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Doolittle's Memoirs, page 2.</NOTE> &s;ixteen miles above fort Dummer. Two Indians took William Phips, as he was hoeing his corn. When they had carried him half a mile, one of them went down a &s;teep hill to fetch &s;omething which had been left. In his ab&s;ence, Phips, with his own hoe, knock|ed down the Indian who was with him; then &s;eizing his gun, &s;hot the other as he a&s;cended the hill.

The fort was alarmed, and one Indian was killed by a &s;hot from the rampart; but no attempt was made to re&s;cue the pri&s;oner.

Proceeding farther, they met three other men, who, by &s;kulk|ing under the bank, got &s;afe to the fort. One of them was Caleb How, the pri&s;on|er's &s;on. When they came oppo&s;ite to Number-four, they made their captive write his name on a piece of bark, and left it there. Having travelled &s;even days we&s;tward, they came to a lake, where they found five canoes, with corn, pork and tobacco. In the&s;e canoes they embarked; and having &s;tuck the &s;calp of David Rugg on a pole, proceeded to the fort at Crown-Point; where How received humane treatment from the French.

Before they proceed|ed to this operation, they demanded a ce&s;|&s;ation of arms till the &s;un-ri&s;ing, which was granted. In the morning Debelin&egrave; came up with fifty men, and a flag of truce which he &s;tuck in the ground. He de|manded a parley, which was agreed to. A French officer, with a &s;oldier and an Indian, then advanced; and propo&s;ed that the garri&s;on &s;hould bind up a quantity of provi&s;ions with their blankets, and having
<PB N="250" REF="023166_0249_0FBC8150064BB1C0">
laid down their arms &s;hould be conducted pri&s;oners to Montreal. Another propo&s;al was, that the two commanders &s;hould meet, and that an an&s;wer &s;hould then be given. Stevens met the French com|mander, who, without waiting for an an|&s;wer, began to enforce his propo&s;al, by threatning to &s;torm the fort, and put every man to death, if they &s;hould refu&s;e his terms, and kill one of his men. Stevens an&s;wered, that he could hearken to no terms till the la&s;t extremity; that he was intru&s;ted with the defence of the fort, and was determined to maintain it, till he &s;hould be convinced that the Frenchman could perform what he had threatned. He added, that it was poor encouragement to &s;urrender, if they were all to be put to the &s;word for killing one man, when it was probable they had already killed more. The Frenchman replied,
<Q>Go and &s;ee if your men dare to fight any longer, and give me a quick an&s;wer.</Q>
Stevens re|turned and a&s;ked his men, whether they would fight or &s;urrender. They unani|mou&s;ly determined to fight. This was immediately made known to the enemy, who renewed their &s;houting and firing all that day and night. On the morning of the third day, they reque&s;ted another ce&s;|&s;ation
<PB N="251" REF="023166_0250_0FBC8151710F95E8">
for two hours. Two Indians came with a flag, and propo&s;ed, that if Stevens would &s;ell them provi&s;ions they would withdraw. He an&s;wered, that to &s;ell them provi&s;ions for money was contrary to the law of nations; but that he would pay them five bu&s;hels of corn for every cap|tive, for whom they would give a ho&s;tage, till the captive could be brought from Canada. After this an&s;wer, a few guns were fired, and the enemy were &s;een no more.</P>
<P>In this furious attack from a &s;tarving enemy, no lives were lo&s;t in the fort, and two men only were wounded. No men could have behaved with more intrepidity in the mid&s;t of &s;uch threatning danger. An expre&s;s was immediately di&s;patched to Bo&s;ton, and the news was there received with great joy. Commodore Sir Charles Knowles was &s;o highly plea&s;ed with the conduct of Capt. Stevens, that he pre|&s;ented him with a valuable and elegant &s;word, as a reward of his bravery. From this circum&s;tance, the town&s;hip, when it was incorporated, took the name of Charle&s;town.</P>
<P>Small parties of the enemy kept hover|ing, and &s;ometimes di&s;covered them&s;elves. Sergeant Phelps killed one, near the fort,
<PB N="252" REF="023166_0251_0FBC815350826508">
and e&s;caped unhurt, though fired upon and pur&s;ued by two others.</P>
<P>Other parties went farther down the country; and at Roche&s;ter, they ambu&s;hed a company who were at work in a field. The ambu&s;h was di&s;covered by three lads,<NOTE PLACE="marg">June 7.</NOTE> John and George Place,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Haven's MS. letter.</NOTE> and Paul Jen|nens. The Indians fired upon them. John Place returned the fire and wounded an Indian. Jennens pre&s;ented his gun but did not fire; this prevented the ene|my from ru&s;hing upon them, till the men from the field came to their relief and put the Indians to flight.</P>

Soon after, the enemy burned Bridgman's fort; (Hin&s;dale) and killed &s;everal per&s;ons, and took others from that place, and from Number-four, in the en|&s;uing winter. No pur&s;uit could be made, becau&s;e the garri&s;on was not provided with &s;now &s;hoes, though many hundreds had been paid for by the Government.</P>
<P>The next &s;pring, Captain Stevens was again appointed to command at Number-four, with a garri&s;on of an hundred men;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1748.</NOTE> Capt.

<PB N="254" REF="023166_0253_0FBC81583B3B0278">
The Indians would have kept her quiet, but as &s;he per&s;i&s;ted in calling, they killed her, apparently contrary to their in|tentions. Her hu&s;band heard her cries, and came to her a&s;&s;i&s;tance, at the in|&s;tant of her death. His gun mi&s;&s;ed fire, and he e&s;caped.

<P>The ce&s;&s;ation of arms between the bel|ligerent powers did not wholly put a &s;top to the incur&s;ions of the enemy;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1749.</NOTE> for after it was known here, and after the garri&s;on of Number-four was withdrawn,<NOTE PLACE="marg">June 17.</NOTE> except|ing fifteen men,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Olcott's MS letter.</NOTE> Obadiah Sortwell was

killed, and a &s;on of Capt. Stevens was taken and carried to Canada; but he was relea&s;ed and returned.</P>
<P>During this affecting &s;cene of deva&s;ta|tion and captivity; there were no in&s;tan|ces of deliberate murder nor torture exer|ci&s;ed on tho&s;e who fell into the hands of the Indians; and even the old cu&s;tom of making them run the gantlet was in mo&s;t ca&s;es omitted. On the the contrary there is an univer&s;al te&s;timony from the cap|tives who &s;urvived and returned, in favor of the humanity of their captors. When feeble, they a&s;&s;i&s;ted them in travelling; and in ca&s;es of di&s;tre&s;s from want of pro|vi&s;ion, they &s;hared with them an equal proportion. A &s;ingular in&s;tance of mod|eration de&s;erves remembrance. An Indi|an had &s;urpri&s;ed a man at A&s;huelot; the man a&s;ked for quarter, and it was grant|ed: Whil&s;t the Indian was preparing to bind him, he &s;eized the Indian's gun, and &s;hot him in one arm.

<P>There was a &s;triking difference between the manner in which this war was man|aged, on the part of the Engli&s;h and on the part of the French. The latter kept out &s;mall parties continually engaged in killing, &s;calping and taking pri&s;oners; who were &s;old in Canada and redeemed by their friends, at a great expen&s;e. By this mode of conduct, the French made their enemies pay the whole charge of their predatory excur&s;ions, be&s;ides reap|ing a hand&s;ome profit to them&s;elves. On the other hand, the Engli&s;h attended on|ly to the defence of the frontiers; and that in &s;uch a manner, as to leave them for the mo&s;t part in&s;ecure. No parties were &s;ent to harra&s;s the &s;ettlements of the French. If the whole country of Can|ada could not be &s;ubdued, nothing le&s;s could be attempted. Men were continu|ally kept in pay, and in expectation of &s;er|vice; but &s;pent their time either in gar|ri&s;ons, or camps, or in guarding provi&s;ions when &s;ent to the &s;everal forts. Though large rewards were promi&s;ed for &s;calps and pri&s;oners, &s;carcely any were obtained, unle&s;s by accident. A confu&s;ion of coun|cils, and a multiplicity of directors, cau&s;|ed

frequent changes of mea&s;ures,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1747.</NOTE> and de|lays in the execution of them. The forts were ill &s;upplied with ammunition, pro|vi&s;ions, clothing and &s;now-&s;hoes. When an alarm happened, it was nece&s;&s;ary, either to bake bread, or dre&s;s meat, or ca&s;t bul|lets, before a pur&s;uit could be made. The French gave commi&s;&s;ions to none but tho&s;e who had di&s;tingui&s;hed them|&s;elves by &s;ome exploit. Among us, per|&s;ons frequently obtained preferment, for them&s;elves or their friends, by making their court to Governors, and promoting favorite mea&s;ures in town meetings, or General A&s;&s;emblies.</P>
<P>A community recovering from a war, like an individual recovering from &s;ickne&s;s, is &s;ometimes in danger of a relap&s;e. This war was not deci&s;ive, and the cau&s;es which kindled it were not removed. One of its effects was, that it produced a cla&s;s of men, who, having been for a time relea&s;ed from laborious occupations, and devoted to the parade of military life, did not readily li&s;|ten to the calls of indu&s;try. To &s;uch men peace was burden&s;ome, and the more &s;o, becau&s;e they had not the advantage of half pay. The interval between this and the &s;ucceeding war was not long. The peace took place in 1749, and in 1754 there was a call to re&s;ume the &s;word.</P>

<P>WHILST the people were contend|ing with an enemy abroad, an attempt was making at home, to revive the old claim of Ma&s;on, which their fathers had with&s;tood, and which for many years had lain dormant, till recalled to view by the politicians of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, as already related.

me&s;&s;ages were &s;ent time after time; but the affairs of the war, and Ma&s;on's ab|&s;ence at &s;ea, and in the expedition to Loui&s;bourg, where he had a company, together with a di&s;inclination in the Hou&s;e, which was of a different complexion from that in 1739, prevented any thing from being done.</P>
<P>In the mean time Ma&s;on &s;uffered a fine and recovery,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1745.</NOTE> by which the entail was docked, in the Courts of New-Hamp&s;hire,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Feb. 22.</NOTE> and he became entitled to the privilege of &s;elling his intere&s;t.

Intimations were given, that if they would not ratify the agreement, a &s;ale would be made to other per&s;ons, who &s;tood ready to purcha&s;e. At length the Hou&s;e came to a re&s;olution,

A committee was appointed to treat with Ma&s;on, about fulfilling his agreement, and to draw the proper in&s;tru|ments of conveyance; but he had on the

This precaution had not at fir&s;t its effect. A committee of both Hou&s;es was appointed to con&s;ider the matter, and they reported, that

<P>Within that month, the alarm cau&s;ed by the approach of D'Anville's fleet, put a &s;top to the negociation.

The purcha&s;ers would not &s;ell, but on condi|tion that the lands &s;hould be granted, by the Governor and Council. The A&s;&s;em|bly thought that they could have no &s;ecu|rity that the land would be granted to the people; becau&s;e the Governor and Council might grant it to them&s;elves, or to their dependents, or to &s;trangers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1747.</NOTE> and the people who had paid for it might be excluded from the benefit which they had purcha&s;ed.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. 20.</NOTE> A propo&s;al was afterward made, that the &s;ale &s;hould be to feoffees in tru&s;t for the people; and a form of a deed for this purpo&s;e was drawn.

farther efforts being made by the A&s;&s;em|bly, the purcha&s;e re&s;ted in the hands of the proprietors. In 1749 they took a &s;econd deed, comprehending all the Ma|&s;onian grants, from Naumkeag to Pa&s;cata|qua;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Records of deeds.</NOTE> whereas the former deed was confin|ed to the lately e&s;tabli&s;hed boundaries of New-Hamp&s;hire. This latter deed was not recorded till 1753.</P>
<P>After they had taken their fir&s;t deed, the Ma&s;onians began to grant town&s;hips,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1748.</NOTE> and continued granting them to petition|ers, often without fees, and always with|out quit-rents. They quieted the propri|etors of the towns, on the we&s;tern &s;ide of the Merrimack, which had been granted by Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, before the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the line; &s;o that they went on peacea|bly with their &s;ettlements. The terms of their grants were, that the grantees &s;hould, within a limited time, erect mills and meeting-hou&s;es, clear out roads and &s;ettle mini&s;ters. In every town&s;hip, they re|&s;erved one right for the fir&s;t &s;ettled mini&s;|ter, another for a par&s;onage, and a third for a &s;chool. They al&s;o re&s;erved fifteen rights for them&s;elves, and two for their attorneys; all of which were to be free from taxes, till &s;old or occupied. By vir|tue of the&s;e grants, many town&s;hips

were &s;ettled, and the intere&s;t of the people became &s;o united with that of the pro|prietors, that the prejudice again&s;t them gradually abated; and, at length, even &s;ome who had been the mo&s;t violent op|po&s;ers, acquie&s;ced in the &s;afety and poli|cy of their mea&s;ures, though they could not concede to the validity of their claim.</P>
<P>The heirs of Allen, menaced them by adverti&s;ements, and warned the people again&s;t accepting their grants.

objection was made by any other per&s;ons, in behalf of the Crown. Surveyors were employed, at &s;everal times, to mark this curve line; but on running, fir&s;t from the &s;outhern, and then from the ea&s;tern boundary, to the river Pemigewa&s;&s;et, they could not make the lines meet. Contro|ver&s;ies were thus engendered, between the grantees of Crown lands and tho&s;e of the Ma&s;onians, which &s;ub&s;i&s;ted for many years. In &s;ome ca&s;es, the di&s;putes were compromi&s;ed, and in others, left open for litigation; till, by the revolution, the gov|ernment fell into other hands.</P>
<P>This was not the only controver&s;y, which, till that period, remained undeter|mined. When the exten&s;ion of the boun|dary lines gave birth to a demand, for the maintenance of fort Dummer, the Gover|nor had the addre&s;s,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Printed Journal,</NOTE> to call to that A&s;&s;em|bly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jan. 1744.</NOTE> into which he introduced this de|mand, &s;ix new members; who appeared as repre&s;entatives for &s;ix towns and di&s;|tricts, &s;ome of which had been, by the &s;outhern line, cut off from Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts. It was &s;uppo&s;ed that his de&s;ign, in calling the&s;e members, was to facilitate the adop|tion of fort Dummer. Other towns, which ought to have had the &s;ame privilege ex|tended to them, were neglected. When
<PB N="268" REF="023166_0267_0FBC81705FE7F030">
the new members appeared in the Hou&s;e, the Secretary, by the Governor's order, admini&s;tered to them the u&s;ual oaths; af|ter which, they were a&s;ked, in the name of the Hou&s;e, by what authority they came thither? They an&s;wered, that they were cho&s;en by virtue of a writ, in the King's name, delivered to their re&s;pective towns and di&s;tricts, by the Sheriff. The Hou&s;e remon&s;trated to the Governor, that the&s;e places had no right, by law, nor by cu&s;tom, to &s;end per&s;ons to repre&s;ent them, and then debarred them from the privi|lege of voting, in the choice of a Speaker; two only di&s;&s;enting, out of nineteen. Several &s;harp me&s;&s;ages pa&s;&s;ed, between the Governor and the Hou&s;e, on that occa&s;ion; but the pre&s;&s;ing exigencies of the war, and the propo&s;ed expedition to Cape-Bre|ton, obliged him, for that time, to give way, and &s;uffer his new members to be excluded, till the King's plea&s;ure could be known.</P>
<P>The Hou&s;e vindicated their proceed|ings, by appealing to their records; from which it appeared, that all the additions, which had been made to the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives, were, in con&s;equence of their own votes, either i&s;&s;uing a precept them&s;elves, or reque&s;ting the Governor to
<PB N="269" REF="023166_0268_0FBC817364782E80">
do it; from which they argued, that no town, or pari&s;h, ought to have any writ, for the choice of a Repre&s;entative, but by a vote of the Hou&s;e, or by an act of the A&s;&s;embly. On the other &s;ide, it was al|leged, that the right of &s;ending Repre&s;ent|atives was originally founded on the roy|al commi&s;&s;ion and in&s;tructions, and there|fore, that the privilege might, by the &s;ame authority, be lawfully extended to the new towns, as the King, or his Gover|nor, by advice of Council, might think proper. The precedents on both &s;ides were undi&s;puted; but neither party would admit the conclu&s;ion drawn by the other. Had this difficulty been fore&s;een, it might have been prevented when the triennial act was made in 1727. The defects of that law, began now to be &s;everely felt; but could not be remedied.</P>
<P>The di&s;pute having thus &s;ub&s;ided, was not revived during the war; but as &s;oon as the peace was made, and be King had gone on a vi&s;it to his German dominions,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dougla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">, II, 35.</NOTE> an additional in&s;truction was &s;ent from the Lords Ju&s;tices, who pre&s;ided in the King's ab&s;ence, directing the Governor to di&s;&s;olve the A&s;&s;embly then &s;ub&s;i&s;ting;<NOTE PLACE="marg">June 30.</NOTE> and when another &s;hould be called, to i&s;&s;ue the King's writ to the Sheriff, commanding

him to make out precepts to the towns and di&s;tricts, who&s;e Repre&s;entatives had been before excluded; and that when they &s;hould be cho&s;en, the Governor &s;hould &s;upport their rights.</P>
<P>Had this in&s;truction extended to all the other towns in the Province, which had not been before repre&s;ented, it might have been deemed equitable; but as it re&s;pect|ed tho&s;e only, which had been the &s;ubject of controver&s;y, it appeared to be ground|ed on partial information, and intended to &s;trengthen the prerogative of the Crown, without a due regard to the privileges of the people at large.</P>
<P>The party in oppo&s;ition to the Gover|nor became more acrimonious than ever.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1749.</NOTE> Richard Waldron,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jan. 3.</NOTE> the former Secretary, and the confidential friend of Belcher, ap|peared in the new A&s;&s;embly and was cho&s;|en Speaker. The Governor negatived him; and ordered the Hou&s;e to admit the new members, and choo&s;e another Speak|er. They denied his power of negativing their Speaker and of introducing new members. The &s;tyle of his me&s;&s;ages was peremptory and &s;evere; their an&s;wers and remon&s;trances were calm, but re&s;olute, and in &s;ome in&s;tances &s;atyrical. Neither party would yield; no bu&s;ine&s;s was tran&s;|acted;

though the A&s;&s;embly met about once in a month, and was kept alive, by adjournments and prorogations, for three years. Had he di&s;&s;olved them, before the time for which they were cho&s;en had ex|pired, he knew, that in all probability, the &s;ame per&s;ons would be re-elected.</P>
<P>The effect of this controver&s;y was inju|rious to the Governor, as well as to the people. The public bills of credit had depreciated &s;ince this admini&s;tration began, in the ratio of thirty to fifty-&s;ix; and the value of the Governor's &s;alary had declin|ed in the &s;ame proportion. The exci&s;e could neither be farmed nor collected; and that part of the Governor's &s;alary, which was funded upon it, failed. The Trea&s;urer's accounts were un&s;ettled. The &s;oldiers, who had guarded the frontiers in the preceding war, were not paid; nor were their mu&s;ter-rolls adju&s;ted. The public records of deeds were &s;hut up; for the Recorder's time having expired, and the appointment being by law ve&s;ted in the A&s;&s;embly, no choice could be made.

fort Dummer, and it was in contempla|tion, to take off a large di&s;trict from the we&s;tern part of New-Hamp&s;hire, and to annex it to Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, to &s;atisfy them for that expen&s;e. Be&s;ides this, the paper money of the Colonies was under the con|&s;ideration of Parliament; and the Province of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts was ri&s;ing into favor for having aboli&s;hed that &s;y&s;tem of iniquity. The &s;ame ju&s;tice was expected of New-Hamp&s;hire, &s;ince they had the &s;ame means in their power by the reimbur&s;ement granted to them by Parliament for the Cape-Breton and Canada expeditions. This money, amounting to about thirty thou&s;and pounds &s;terling, clear of all fees and commi&s;&s;ions, had lain long in the trea&s;ury; and when it was paid to the a|gent, he would have placed it in the funds, where it might have yielded an in|tere&s;t of three per cent; but having no directions from the A&s;&s;embly, he locked it up in the bank. This was a clear lo&s;s to them of nine hundred pounds per an|num. There were &s;ome who reflected on the agent, as if he had made an advantage to him&s;elf of this money. Had he done it, his own capital was &s;ufficient to have an&s;wered any of their demands; but it was al&s;o &s;ufficient to put him above the

When this &s;ugge&s;tion came to his knowledge,<NOTE PLACE="marg">MS letter of Thomlin|&s;on to H.

He &s;aid, that the Governor him&s;elf had &s;tated the facts in his letters to the mini&s;|try; concerning his calling of the new members, in 1745, and their exclu&s;ion from the A&s;&s;embly, with the rea&s;ons given for it; and had de&s;ired to know the King's plea&s;ure, and to have directions how to act. That the mini&s;try, without any ex|ception or he&s;itation, had pronounced his conduct conformable to his duty. That neverthele&s;s, the Board of Trade had &s;ol|emnly con&s;idered the matter, and con&s;ult|ed Council, and had &s;ummoned him, as agent of the Province, to attend their de|liberation. Their re&s;ult was, that as the Crown had an indi&s;putable right to incor|porate any town in England, and quali|fy it to &s;end members to Parliament, &s;o
<PB N="275" REF="023166_0274_0FBC817C31CC0430">
the &s;ame right and power had been legal|ly given to all the Governors in America; by means of which, all the A&s;&s;emblies in the King's governments had increa&s;ed in number, as the Colonies had increa&s;ed in &s;ettlements. That any other u&s;age in call|ing Repre&s;entatives was wrong; although it might have been indulged, when the Province was under the &s;ame Governor with Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts. This was all which pa&s;&s;ed before the additional in&s;truction came out, which was &s;ent through the hands of the Agent. As it was founded on a que&s;tion concerning the rights and prerogatives of the Crown; he argued the ab&s;urdity of &s;uppo&s;ing, either that it had been &s;olicited, or that any attempt to have it withdrawn could be effectual. His ad|vice was, that they &s;hould &s;ubmit to it; becau&s;e, that under it, they would enjoy the &s;ame rights and privileges with their fellow &s;ubjects in England, and in the other Colonies; a&s;&s;uring them, that the then reigning Prince had never di&s;covered the lea&s;t inclination to infringe the con|&s;titutional rights of any of his &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>This advice, however &s;alutary, had not the intended effect. In&s;tead of &s;ubmit|ting, the party in oppo&s;ition to the Gov|ernor, framed a complaint again&s;t him,

and &s;ent it to London, to be pre&s;ented to the King. If they could have prevailed, their next mea&s;ure would have been, to recommend a gentleman of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts for his &s;ucce&s;&s;or. This manoeuvre came to the ears of Thomlin&s;on; but he was under no nece&s;&s;ity to exert him&s;elf on this occa&s;ion; for the per&s;on to who&s;e care the addre&s;s was intru&s;ted, con&s;idering the ab&s;urdity of complaining to the King,<NOTE PLACE="marg">MS letters of Thom|lin&s;on.</NOTE> again&s;t his Governor, for acting agreeably to his in&s;tructions, was advi&s;ed not to pre&s;ent it.

A liberal di&s;tribution of commi&s;&s;ions, civil and military, was made, and an era of dome&s;tic reconciliation commenced.</P>
<P>The controver&s;y re&s;pecting Fort Dum|mer, and the fear of lo&s;ing a di&s;trict in that neighbourhood, quickened the Gov|ernor to make grants of &s;everal town&s;hips in that quarter, on both &s;ides of Connec|ticut river; chiefly to tho&s;e per&s;ons who claimed the &s;ame lands, under the Ma&s;&s;a|chu&s;etts title. The war being over, the old inhabitants returned to their planta|tions, and were &s;trengthened by additions to their number. It was in contempla|tion, to extend the &s;ettlements, farther up Connecticut river, to the rich meadows of Cohos. The plan was, to cut a road to that place; to lay out two town&s;hips, one
<PB N="278" REF="023166_0277_0FBC81823B6EA150">
on each &s;ide of the river, and oppo&s;ite to each other; to erect &s;tockades, with lodg|ments for two hundred men,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Atkin&s;on's MS letters.</NOTE> in each town|&s;hip, enclo&s;ing a &s;pace of fifteen acres; in the center of which was to be a citadel, containing the public buildings and gran|aries, which were to be large enough to receive all the inhabitants, and their mov|able effects, in ca&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity. As an inducement to people to remove to this new plantation; they were to have Courts of Judicature, and other civil privileges a|mong them&s;elves, and were to be under &s;trict military di&s;cipline. A large number of per&s;ons engaged in this enterpri&s;e; and they were the rather &s;timulated to un|dertake it, becau&s;e it was feared, that the French, who had already begun to en|croach on the territory claimed by the Briti&s;h Crown, would take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this valuable tract, if it &s;hould be left unoccupied.</P>

again&s;t this proceeding. They came to the fort at Number-four, with a flag of truce; pretending that they had not heard of a treaty of peace, which had been made with the &s;everal Indian tribes. They complained to Captain Stevens, of the encroachment which was meditating on their land; and &s;aid, that they could not allow the Engli&s;h to &s;ettle at Cohos, when they owned more land already than they could improve; and, that if this &s;ettlement were pur&s;ued, they &s;hould think the Eng|li&s;h had a mind for war, and would re&s;i&s;t them. This threatening being commu|nicated to the Governor of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, and by him to the Governor of New-Hamp&s;hire, threw &s;uch di&s;couragement on the project that it was laid a&s;ide.</P>
<P>The Indians did not content them&s;elves with remon&s;trating and threatning.

A party of ten or twelve of the &s;ame tribe, commanded by Captain Mo&s;es, met with four young men who

John received a &s;evere beating from the Indians for alarming his brother. They carried him and his companion, Ea&s;tman, up Connecticut river, through &s;everal carrying places, and down the Lake Memphrimagog to the head quarters of their tribe. There they dre&s;&s;ed him in their fine&s;t robes and adopted him as a &s;on.

but &s;o &s;hallow, that their bodies were de|voured by bea&s;ts of prey, and their bones lay on the ground.

<HEAD>CHAP. XXII. The la&s;t French and Indian war, which ter|minated in the conque&s;t of Canada. Con|trover&s;y concerning the lands we&s;tward of Connecticut river.</HEAD>
<P>BY the treaty of Aix la Chappelle, in 1748, it was &s;tipulated, that
<Q>all things &s;hould be re&s;tored,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Printed treaty.</NOTE> on the foot|ing they were before the war.</Q>
The i&s;land of Cape-Breton was accordingly re|&s;tored to France; but the limits of the French and Engli&s;h territories on the continent, were undetermined; and it was the policy of both nations to gain po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of important pa&s;&s;es, to which each had &s;ome preten&s;ions, and to hold them, till the limits &s;hould be &s;ettled by Com|mi&s;&s;ioners mutually cho&s;en. The&s;e com|mi&s;&s;ioners met at Paris; but came to no deci&s;ion. By the con&s;truction of charters and grants from the Crown of England, her colonies extended indefinitely we&s;t|ward. The French had &s;ettlements in Canada and Loui&s;iana, and they meditat|ed to join the&s;e di&s;tant Colonies, by a chain of forts and po&s;ts, from the St. Lawrence to the Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi; and to extend

the limits of Canada, as far ea&s;tward, as to command navigation in the winter, when the great river St. Lawrence is impa&s;&s;able. The&s;e claims of territory, extending on the one part from ea&s;t to we&s;t, and on the other from north to &s;outh, nece&s;&s;arily in|terfered. The Colonies of Nova-Scotia, New-York and Virginia, were principally affected by this interference; and the en|croachments made on them by the French, were a &s;ubject of complaint, both here and in Europe.</P>
<P>It was fore&s;een that this controver&s;y could not be decided but by the &s;word; and the Engli&s;h determined to be early in their preparations.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1754.</NOTE> The Earl of Holder|ne&s;s,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Shirley's letters and &s;peeches.</NOTE> Secretary of State, wrote to the Gov|ernors of the American Colonies, recom|mending <HI>union</HI> for their mutual protec|tion and defence.

The &s;ub&s;tance of the plan was, that application be made, for an act of Parliament, to form a grand Council, con&s;i&s;ting of dele|gates from the &s;everal legi&s;lative A&s;&s;em|blies, &s;ubject to the control of a Pre&s;ident-General, to be appointed by the Crown, with a negative voice.

<P>With the plan of union, a repre&s;enta|tion was made to the King, of the danger in which the Colonies were involved. Cop|ies of both were laid before the &s;everal A&s;&s;emblies. They were fully &s;en&s;ible of their danger from the French; but they apprehended greater danger from the plan of union. Its fate was &s;ingular. It was rejected in America, becau&s;e it was &s;up|po&s;ed to put too much power in|to the hands of the King; and it was rejected in England, becau&s;e it was &s;uppo&s;ed to give too much power to the A&s;&s;emblies of the Colonies. The mini&s;|try made another propo&s;al; that the Gov|ernor,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Franklin's Examina|tion. 1766.</NOTE> with one or two members of the Council, of each Colony, &s;hould a&s;&s;emble, and con&s;ult for the common defence, and draw on the Briti&s;h trea&s;ury for the &s;ums expended; which &s;hould be rai&s;ed by a
<PB N="287" REF="023166_0286_0FBC82C114E91E70">
general tax, laid by Parliament, on the Colonies. But this was not a time to pu&s;h &s;uch an alarming innovation; and when it was found impracticable, the mini&s;try determined to employ their own troops, to fight their battles in America, rather than to let the Coloni&s;ts feel their own &s;trength, and be directed by their own Coun&s;els.</P>
<P>To draw &s;ome aid however from the Colonies was nece&s;&s;ary. Their militia might &s;erve as guards, or rangers, or la|borers, or do garri&s;on duty, or be em|ployed in other inferior offices; but Brit|i&s;h troops, commanded by Briti&s;h officers, mu&s;t have the <HI>honor</HI> of reducing the French dominions in North America.</P>
<P>The &s;avage nations in the French inte|re&s;t were always ready, on the fir&s;t ap|pearance of a rupture, to take up the hatchet. It was the policy of the French government, to encourage their depreda|tions, on the frontiers of the Engli&s;h Col|onies, to which they had a native antipa|thy. By this means, the French could make their enemies pay the whole expen&s;e of a war; for all the &s;upplies, which they afforded to the Indians, were amply com|pen&s;ated, by the ran&s;om of captives. In the&s;e later wars, therefore, we find the
<PB N="288" REF="023166_0287_0FBC82C2CB7CCBC0">
&s;avages more dextrous in taking captives, and more tender of them when taken, than in former wars; which were carried on with circum&s;tances of greater cruelty.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner had the alarm of ho&s;tilities, which commenced between the Engli&s;h and French, in the we&s;tern part of Virgi|nia, &s;pread through the continent; than the Indians renewed their attacks on the frontiers of New-Hamp&s;hire. A party of them made an a&s;&s;ault,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. 15.</NOTE> on a family at Baker's-town, on Pemigewa&s;&s;et river; where they killed a woman, and took &s;ev|eral captives. Within three days they killed a man and woman at Steven's town in the &s;ame neighbourhood;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. 18.</NOTE> upon which the &s;ettlements were broken up,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Council minutes.</NOTE> and the people retired to the lower towns for &s;afe|ty, and the government was obliged to po&s;t &s;oldiers in the de&s;erted places. After a few days more,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. 29.</NOTE> they broke into the hou&s;e of James John&s;on, at Number-four, early in the morning, before any of the family were awake; and took him, with his wife and three children, her &s;i&s;ter Miriam Wil|lard, and two men, Peter Laboree and Ebenezer Farn&s;worth. The &s;urpri&s;al was complete and bloodle&s;s,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Olcott's MS letter.</NOTE> and they carried them off undi&s;turbed. The next day John&s;on's wife was delivered of a daughter,
<PB N="289" REF="023166_0288_0FBC82C5DEA3A0C0">
who from the circum&s;tances of its birth was named <HI>Captive.</HI> The Indians halted one day, on the woman's account, and the next day re&s;umed their march; carrying her on a litter, which they made for the purpo&s;e, and afterward put her on hor&s;e|back. On their march, they were di&s;tre&s;&s;|ed for provi&s;ion; and killed the hor&s;e for food; the infant was nouri&s;hed, by &s;uck|ing pieces of its fle&s;h. When they arriv|ed at Montreal, John&s;on obtained a parole, of two months, to return and &s;olicit the means of redemption. He applied to the A&s;&s;embly of New-Hamp&s;hire, and af|ter &s;ome delay obtained one hundred and fifty pounds &s;terling.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dec. 19.</NOTE> <NOTE PLACE="marg">A&s;&s;embly Records.</NOTE> But the &s;ea&s;on was &s;o far advanced, and the winter proved &s;o &s;evere, that he did not reach Canada till the &s;pring. He was then charged with breaking his parole; a great part of his money was taken from him by violence; and, he was &s;hut up with his family in pri&s;on; where they took the &s;mall pox, which they happily &s;urvived. After eigh|teen months, the woman, with her &s;i&s;ter, and two daughters, were &s;ent in a cartel &s;hip to England; and thence returned to Bo&s;ton. John&s;on was kept in pri&s;on three years; and then, with his &s;on, returned and met his wife in Bo&s;ton; where he had

the &s;ingular ill fortune, to be &s;u&s;pected of de&s;igns unfriendly to his country, and was again impri&s;oned; but no evidence being produced again&s;t him, he was libe|rated. His elde&s;t daughter was retained in a Canadian nunnery.</P>
<P>The fort and &s;ettlement at Number-four, being in an expo&s;ed &s;ituation, requir|ed a&s;&s;i&s;tance and &s;upport. It had been built by Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts when it was &s;up|po&s;ed to be within its limits. It was pro|jected by Colonel Stoddard, of Northamp|ton, and was well &s;ituated, in connection with the other forts, on the we&s;tern fron|tier,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Shirley's MS letters.</NOTE> to command all the paths, by which the Indians travelled from Canada to New-England. It was now evidently in New-Hamp&s;hire; and Shirley, by advice of his Council, applied to Wentworth, recom|mending the future maintenance of that po&s;t, to the care of his A&s;&s;embly; but they did not think them&s;elves intere&s;ted in its pre&s;ervation, and refu&s;ed to make any pro|vi&s;ion for it. The inhabitants made &s;eve|ral applications for the &s;ame purpo&s;e; but were uniformly di&s;appointed. They then made pre&s;&s;ing remon&s;trances to the A&s;&s;em|bly of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ma&s;&s;achu&s;&middot; Records.</NOTE> who &s;ent &s;oldiers for the defence of that po&s;t, and of Fort Dum|mer, till 1757; when they &s;uppo&s;ed that
<PB N="291" REF="023166_0290_0FBC82C8CB8FD2D8">
the commander in chief of the King's forces would take them under his care, as royal garri&s;ons. It was al&s;o recommended to the A&s;&s;embly of New-Hamp&s;hire to build a fort at Cohos; but this propo&s;al met the &s;ame fate.</P>
<P>The next &s;pring, three expeditions were undertaken again&s;t the French forts.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1755.</NOTE> One again&s;t Fort Duque&s;ne, on the Ohio, was conducted by General Braddock; who was defeated and &s;lain. Another again&s;t Niagara, by Governor Shirley, which mi&s;|carried; and a third again&s;t Crown Point, by General John&s;on. For this la&s;t expe|dition, New-Hamp&s;hire rai&s;ed five hun|dred men, and put them under the com|mand of Col. Jo&s;eph Blanchard. The Governor ordered them to Connecticut riv|er, to build a fort at Cohos, &s;uppo&s;ing it to be in their way to Crown Point. They fir&s;t marched to Baker's-town, where they began to build batteaux, and con&s;umed time and provi&s;ions to no purpo&s;e. By Shirley's advice they quitted that futile employment, and made a fatiguing march through the woods, by the way of Num|ber-four, to Albany. Whil&s;t John&s;on lay encamped at Lake George, with his other forces, he po&s;ted the New-Hamp&s;hire regi|ment at Fort Edward. On the eighth of
<PB N="292" REF="023166_0291_0FBC82C9F3D17508">
September, he was attacked in his camp, by Baron Die&s;kau, commanding a body of French regular troops,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sept. 8.</NOTE> Canadians and Savages. On the morning of that day, a &s;couting party from Fort Edward di&s;cover|ed waggons burning in the road; upon which Captain Nathaniel Fol&s;om was or|dered out, with eighty of the New-Hamp|&s;hire regiment, and forty of New-York under Capt. McGennis. When they came to the place, they found the waggoners and the cattle dead; but no enemy was there. Hearing the report of guns&punc; to|ward the lake, they ha&s;ted thither; and having approached within two miles, found the baggage of the French army, under the care of a guard, whom they attacked and di&s;per&s;ed. When the retreating army of Die&s;kau appeared, about four of the clock in the afternoon,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fol&s;om's informa|tion.</NOTE> Fol&s;om po&s;ted his men among the trees, and kept up a well directed fire, till night; the enemy retired, with great lo&s;s, and he made his way to the camp, carrying his own wounded, and &s;everal French pri&s;oners, with many of the enemy's packs. This well-timed engage|ment,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ohn&s;on's printed let|ter.</NOTE> in which but &s;ix men on our &s;ide were lo&s;t, deprived the French army of their ammunition and baggage; the re|mains of which were brought into
<PB N="293" REF="023166_0292_0FBC82CB94DE4518">
camp the next day. After this, the regi|ment of New-Hamp&s;hire joined the army. The men were employed in &s;couting,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Atkin&s;on's MS letters.</NOTE> which &s;ervice they performed in a manner &s;o acceptable, that no other duty was re|quired of them. Parties of them frequent|ly went within view of the French fort at Crown-Point; and at one time they brought off the &s;calp of a French &s;oldier, whom they killed near the gate.</P>
<P>After the engagement on the 8th of September, when it was found nece&s;&s;ary to reinforce the army; a &s;econd regiment, of three hundred men, was rai&s;ed in New-Hamp&s;hire, and put under the command of Col. Peter Gilman. The&s;e men were as alert, and indefatigable as their brethren, though they had not opportunity to give such convincing evidence of it. The ex|pedition was no farther pur&s;ued; and late <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n autumn the forces were di&s;banded and returned home.</P>
<P>The exertions made for the reduction of Crown Point, not only failed of their object, but provoked the Indians, to execute their mi&s;chievous de&s;igns, again&s;t the fron|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">iers of New-Hamp&s;hire; which were wholly uncovered, and expo&s;ed to their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ull force.

communication by &s;hort carrying-places, with which they were perfectly acquaint|ed. The Indians of that river, therefore, made frequent incur&s;ions, and returned unmole&s;ted with their pri&s;oners and booty.</P>
<P>At New-Hopkinton, they took a man and a boy; but perceiving the approach of a &s;couting party,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sum<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">er's MS letter.</NOTE> they fled and left their captives. At Keene, they took Ben|jamin Twitchel, and at Walpole they kill-Daniel Twitchel, and a man named Flynt. At the &s;ame place Colonel Bellows, at the head of twenty men,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fe&s;&s;enden's MS letter.</NOTE> met with a party of fifty Indians; and having exchanged &s;ome &s;hot, and killed &s;everal of the enemy, he broke through them and got into the fort; not one man of his company being killed or wounded. After a few days, the&s;e In|dians, being joined by others to the num|ber of one hundred and &s;eventy, a&s;&s;aulted the garri&s;on of John Kilburne, in which were him&s;elf, John Pike, two boys and &s;everal women; who bravely defended the hou&s;e and obliged the enemy to retire, with con&s;iderable lo&s;s. Pike was mortally wounded. Some of the&s;e Indians joined Die&s;kau's army, and were in the battle at Lake George. At Number-four, they killed a large number of cattle, and cut off the fle&s;h. At Hin&s;dale, they attacked a

Howe was killed;<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 27.</NOTE> Gaffield was drowned in attemping to cro&s;s the river; and Grout made his e&s;cape. The Indians went directly to Bridgman's fort, where the families of the&s;e unfortunate men re|&s;ided. They had heard the report of the guns, and were impatient to learn the cau&s;e. By the &s;ound of feet without, it being in the du&s;k of the evening, they concluded that their friends had returned, and too ha&s;tily opened the gate to receive them; when to their inexpre&s;&s;ible &s;urpri&s;e, they admitted the &s;avages, and the three families, con&s;i&s;ting of fourteen per&s;ons, were made captives.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q><P>One of the&s;e, the wife of Caleb Howe, was the FAIR CAPTIVE, of whom &s;uch a brilliant account is given in the life of General Put|nam, publi&s;hed by Col.

The Indians were engaged in a grand dance, and he pa&s;&s;ed through them undi&s;covered. Having formed his men into parties, and po&s;ted them to advantage; he made a general a&s;|&s;ault, ju&s;t before day, whil&s;t the In|dians were a&s;leep. They were &s;o com|pletely &s;urpri&s;ed that little re&s;i&s;tance could be made. Some were killed in their hou&s;|es; and of tho&s;e who attempted to flee, ma|ny were &s;hot or tomahawked by parties placed at the avenues. The dawn of day di&s;clo&s;ed a horrid &s;cene; and an edge was given to the fury of the a&s;&s;ailants by the

&s;ight of &s;everal hundred &s;calps of their countrymen, elevated on poles, and wav|ing in the air. This village had been en|riched with the plunder of the frontiers and the &s;ale of captives. The hou&s;es were well furni&s;hed, and the church was adorned with plate. The &s;uddenne&s;s of the attack, and the fear of a pur&s;uit, did not allow much time for pillage; but the rangers brought off &s;uch things as were mo&s;t convenient for tran&s;portation; a|mong which were about two hundred guineas in money, a &s;ilver image weigh|ing ten pounds, a large quantity of wampum and clothing. Having &s;et fire to the village, Rogers made his retreat up the river St. Francis, intending that his men &s;hould rendezvous at the upper Co|hos, on Connecticut river. They took with them five Engli&s;h pri&s;oners, whom they found at St. Francis, and about twenty Indians; but the&s;e la&s;t they di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed. Of the rangers, one man only was killed; and &s;ix or &s;even were wound|ed. In their retreat, they were pur&s;ued, and lo&s;t &s;even men.

<P>After the taking of Quebec, the remain|der of the &s;ea&s;on was too &s;hort to com|plete the reduction of Canada.

Many captives returned to their homes; and friends who had long been &s;eparated, em|braced each other in peace.

<P><PB N="307" REF="023166_0306_0FBC82E8F81D3048">The expen&s;e of this war, was paid by a paper currency.

Governor Wentworth was &s;low to take advantage of this provi&s;o, and con&s;trued the act in a more rigid &s;en&s;e than others; but his friend Shirley helped him out of his diffi|culties.

<P>It ought to be remembered as a &s;ignal favor of divine Providence; that during this war, the &s;ea&s;ons were fruitful, and the Colonies were able to &s;upply their own troops with provi&s;ions, and the Briti&s;h fleets and armies with refre&s;hments of ev|ery kind which they needed.

Had this calamity attended any of the preceding years of the war, the di&s;tre&s;s mu&s;t have been extreme, both at home and in the camp.

<P>The war being clo&s;ed, a large and valu|able tract of country, &s;ituated between New-England, New-York and Canada, was &s;ecured to the Briti&s;h dominions; and it became the intere&s;t of the Governors of both the royal Provinces of New-Hamp|&s;hire and New-York, to vie with each other, in granting this territory and re|ceiving the emoluments ari&s;ing from this lucrative branch of their re&s;pective offices.

This claim was founded on a grant of King Charles the &s;econd; in which,
<Q>all the land from the we&s;t &s;ide of Connecticut river, to the ea&s;t &s;ide of Delaware bay,</Q>
was con|veyed to his brother James, Duke of York; by who&s;e elevation to the throne, the &s;ame tract merged in the crown of England, and de&s;cended at the Revolu|tion to King William and his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors.
<PB N="311" REF="023166_0310_0FBC82F189A9D4C8">
The Province of New-York had formerly urged this claim again&s;t the Colony of Connecticut; but for prudential rea&s;ons had conceded that the bounds of that Co|lony &s;hould extend, as far as a line drawn twenty miles ea&s;t of Hud&s;on's river. The like extent was demanded by Ma&s;&s;achu|&s;etts; and, though New-York affected to call this demand 'an intru&s;ion,' and &s;tren|uou&s;ly urged their right to extend ea&s;t|ward to Connecticut river; yet the origi|nal grant of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, being prior to that of the Duke of York, was a barrier which could not ea&s;ily be broken. The&s;e rea&s;ons, however, it was &s;aid, could be of no avail to the cau&s;e of New-Hamp&s;hire, who&s;e fir&s;t limits, as de&s;cribed in Ma&s;on's patent, did not reach to Connecticut river; and who&s;e late extent, by the &s;ettlement of the lines in 1741, was no farther we&s;t|ward than
<Q>till it meets with the King's other governments.</Q>
Though it was agreed, between the two Governors, to &s;ubmit the point in controver&s;y to the King; yet the Governor of New-Hamp|&s;hire, continued to make grants, on the we&s;tern &s;ide of Connecticut river, till 1754; when the renewal of ho&s;tilities not only put a &s;top to applications; but pre|vented

<HEAD>CHAP. XXIII. Beginning of the controver&s;y with Great-Britain. Stamp act. Re&s;ignation of <HI>BEN|NING WENTWORTH.</HI></HEAD>
<P>FROM the earlie&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hment of the American Colonies, a jealou&s;y of their independence had exi&s;ted among the people of Great-Britain. At fir&s;t, this apprehen&s;ion was perhaps no more than a conjecture founded on the vici&s;&s;i|tude of human affairs, or on their know|ledge of tho&s;e emigrants who came away from England, di&s;gu&s;ted with the abu&s;ive treatment which they had endured at home. But from whatever cau&s;e it aro&s;e, it was &s;trengthened by age; and the conduct of the Briti&s;h government toward America, was frequently influenced by it. In the reign of James the first,
<Q>&s;peculative rea|&s;oners rai&s;ed objections to the planting of the&s;e Colonies; and foretold,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hume.</NOTE> that af|ter draining the mother country of in|habitants, they would &s;hake off her yoke and erect an independent government.</Q>
Some traces of this jealou&s;y appeared in every &s;ucceeding reign,<NOTE PLACE="marg">See vol 1. page 309.</NOTE> not excepting that of William, whom America, as well as
<PB N="318" REF="023166_0317_0FBC82FDB85A54A0">
Britain, was proud to &s;tyle
<Q>our great deliverer.</Q>
But it became mo&s;t evident, and began to produce its mo&s;t pernicious effects, at a time when there was the lea&s;t rea&s;on for indulging the idea.</P>
<P>During the admini&s;tration of PITT, a liberal kind of policy had been adopted toward the Colonies; which being crown|ed with &s;ucce&s;s, had attached us<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Though It may be accounted a deviation from the proper &s;tyle of hi&s;tory, for the author to &s;peak in the fir&s;t per&s;on; yet he hopes to be excu&s;ed in expre&s;&s;ing the feelings of an American, whil&s;t be relates the hi&s;tory of his own time, and his own country.</NOTE> more firmly than ever, to the kingdom of Britain. We were proud of our connex|ion with a nation who&s;e flag was triumph|ant in every quarter of the globe; and by who&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;tance we had been delivered from the danger of our mo&s;t formidable enemies, the French in Canada. The ac|ce&s;&s;ion of George the third,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1760.</NOTE> at this criti|cal and important era, was celebrated here, with as true zeal and loyalty, as in any part of his dominions. We were fond of repeating every plaudit, which the ardent affection of the Briti&s;h nation be&s;towed on a young monarch, ri&s;ing to the throne of his ance&s;tors, and profe&s;&s;ing to
<Q>glory in the name of Briton.</Q>
At &s;uch a time, nothing could have been more ea&s;y, than by pur&s;uing the &s;y&s;tem of commercial reg|ulation,
<PB N="319" REF="023166_0318_0FBC82FF45D462C8">
already e&s;tabli&s;hed, and continu|ing the indulgencies which had been al|lowed, to have drawn the whole profit of our labor and trade, into the hands of briti&s;h merchants and manufacturers. This would have prevented a &s;pirit of en|terpri&s;e in the Colonies, and kept us in as complete &s;ubjection and dependence, as the mo&s;t &s;anguine friend of the Briti&s;h nation could have wi&s;hed.</P>
<P>We had, among our&s;elves, a &s;et of men, who,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1763.</NOTE> ambitious of perpetuating the rank of their families,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bernard's &s;elect let|ters.</NOTE> were privately &s;eeking the e&s;tabli&s;hment of an <HI>American Nobili|ty</HI>; out of which,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Oliver's letters.</NOTE> an intermediate branch of legi&s;lation, between the royal and de|mocratic powers, &s;hould be appointed. Plans were drawn, and pre&s;ented to the Briti&s;h mini&s;try, for new modelling our governments, and reducing their powers; whil&s;t the authority of Parliament &s;hould be rendered ab&s;olute and imperial. The military gentlemen of Britain, who had &s;erved here in the war, and on whom, a profu&s;ion of grateful attention had been be&s;towed, carried home reports of our wealth; whil&s;t the &s;ons of our merchants and planters, who went to England for their education, exhibited &s;pecimens of prodigality which confirmed the idea.
<PB N="320" REF="023166_0319_0FBC8300CE418558">
During the war, there had been a great influx of money; and at the conclu&s;ion of it, Briti&s;h goods were largely imported; by which means, the ca&s;h went back again with a rapid circulation.</P>
<P>In no age, perhaps, excepting that in which Rome lo&s;t her liberty, was the &s;pi|rit of venality and corruption &s;o prevalent as at this time,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hi&s;tory of the minor|ity, 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">65, page 286.</NOTE> in Britain. Exhau&s;ted by a long war, and di&s;graced by a peace which deprived her of her mo&s;t valuable con|que&s;ts, the national &s;upplies were inade|quate to the continual drain of the ex|checquer. A new mini&s;try, rai&s;ed on the ruin of that by which America was con|quered and &s;ecured, looked to this coun|try as a &s;ource of revenue. But, neglect|ing the 'principles of law and polity, which had been early &s;ugge&s;ted to them by an officious corre&s;pondent;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bernard's &s;elect let|ters.</NOTE> and by which they might have gradually and &s;i|lently extended their &s;y&s;tem of corrup|tion into America; they planned mea|&s;ures by which they &s;uppo&s;ed an addition to the revenues of Britain might be drawn from America; and the pretence was,
<Q>to defray the expen&s;es of protecting, de|fending and &s;ecuring it.</Q>
The fallacy of this pretence was ea&s;ily &s;een. If we had not done our part toward the protec|tion
<PB N="321" REF="023166_0320_0FBC830230770738">
and defence of our country, why were our expenditures reimbur&s;ed by Par|liament? The truth is, that during the whole war, we had exerted our&s;elves be|yond our ability; relying on a promi&s;e from a Secretary of State, that it &s;hould be recommended to Parliament to make us compen&s;ation. It was recommended; the compen&s;ation was honorably granted, and gratefully received. The idea of drawing that money from us again by taxes to repay the charges of our former de|fence, was unju&s;t and incon&s;i&s;tent. If the new conque&s;ts needed protection or defence, tho&s;e who reaped the gain of their commerce, or enjoyed the benefit of grants and offices within tho&s;e territories, might be required to contribute their aid. Notwith&s;tanding this pretext, it was our opinion, that the grand object was to pro|vide for dependents, and to extend the corrupt and venal principle of crown in|fluence, through every part of the Briti&s;h dominions. However artfully it was thrown out, that the revenue to be drawn from us would ea&s;e the taxes of our bre|thren in Britain, or dimini&s;h the load of national debt; it was not ea&s;y for us to believe that the mini&s;try had either of the&s;e objects &s;incerely in contemplation. But
<PB N="322" REF="023166_0321_0FBC8303AE559E38">
if it had been ever &s;o equitable that we &s;hould contribute to di&s;charge the debt of the nation, incurred by the preceding war; we &s;uppo&s;ed that the monopoly and con|trol of our commerce, which Britain en|joyed, was a full equivalent for all the advantages, which we reaped from our po|litical connexion with her.</P>
<P>The &s;ame gazette, which contained the definitive treaty of peace,<NOTE PLACE="marg">N. Hamp|&s;hire Ga|zette, May 27.</NOTE> announced the intentions of the Briti&s;h mini&s;try to quar|ter troops in America, and &s;upport them at our expen&s;e. The money was to be rai&s;ed by a duty on foreign &s;ugar and mola&s;|&s;es, and by &s;tamps on all papers legal and mercantile. The&s;e intentions were at fir&s;t thrown out in the form of re&s;olves, and afterward dige&s;ted into acts of Parli|ament. The fir&s;t of the&s;e acts, re&s;tricting the intercour&s;e which the American Colo|nies had enjoyed with the We&s;t-India i&s;lands,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1764.</NOTE> cau&s;ed a general unea&s;ine&s;s and &s;u&s;picion, but was viewed as a regulation of trade, and was &s;ubmitted to, though with reluctance. The effect of this act was to call forth a &s;pirit of frugality, par|ticularly in the introduction of a le&s;s ex|pen&s;ive mode of conducing funerals. Pe|titions and remon&s;trances were &s;ent to England by &s;ome of the Colonies; but
<PB N="323" REF="023166_0322_0FBC830819C580F0">
in&s;tead of any redre&s;s,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1765.</NOTE> a new act of Parli|ament was made for rai&s;ing a revenue by a general &s;tamp duty through all the American Colonies. The true friends of con&s;titutional liberty now &s;aw their deare&s;t intere&s;ts in danger; from an a&s;&s;umption of power in the parent &s;tate to give and grant the property of the coloni&s;ts at their plea&s;ure. Even tho&s;e who had been &s;eek|ing alterations in the colonial governments, and an e&s;tabli&s;hment of hereditary honors, plainly &s;aw that the mini&s;try were de&s;ir|ous of plucking the fruit,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bernard's &s;elect let|ters.</NOTE> before they had grafted the &s;tock on which it mu&s;t grow. To render the new act le&s;s odious to us, &s;ome of our fellow citizens were appoint|ed to di&s;tribute the &s;tamped paper, which was prepared in England and brought over in bales. The framers of the act <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oa&s;ted that it was &s;o contrived as to exe|cute it&s;elf; becau&s;e no writing could be deemed legal without the &s;tamp; and all controver&s;ies which might ari&s;e, were to be determined in the Courts of Admi|ralty, by a &s;ingle judge, entirely dependent on the Crown.</P>
<P>This direct and violent attack on our deare&s;t privileges at fir&s;t threw us into a &s;ilent gloom; and we were at a lo&s;s how to proceed. To &s;ubmit, was to rivet the
<PB N="324" REF="023166_0323_0FBC8308F6C1E9F0">
&s;hackles of &s;lavery on our&s;elves and our po&s;terity. To revolt, was to rend a&s;un|der the mo&s;t endearing connexion, and hazard the re&s;entment of a powerful na|tion. In this dilemma, the Hou&s;e of Burge&s;&s;es in Virginia,<NOTE PLACE="marg">May 28.</NOTE> pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome &s;pirited re&s;olves, a&s;&s;erting the rights of their coun|try, and denying the claim of parliament|ary taxation. The A&s;&s;embly of Ma&s;&s;a|chu&s;etts propo&s;ed a Congre&s;s of Deputies from each Colony,<NOTE PLACE="marg">June 6.</NOTE> to con&s;ult upon our common intere&s;t, as had frequently been practi&s;ed in times of common danger. Several &s;peeches made in Parliament by oppo&s;ers of the &s;tamp-act were reprinted here; in one of which the Americans were &s;tyled 'Sons of liberty,' and the &s;peaker ventured,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Col. Bar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">.</NOTE> from his per&s;onal knowledge of this country, to foretel our oppo&s;ition to the act.</P>
<P>The &s;pirit of the Virginian re&s;olves, like an electric &s;park, diffu&s;ed it&s;elf in|&s;tantly and univer&s;ally; and the cautious propo&s;al of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts was generally approved. The anxious mind, re&s;ting on the bold a&s;&s;ertion of con&s;titutional rights, looked forward with plea&s;ure, to the time when an American Congre&s;s would unite in a &s;ucce&s;sful defence of them. The title 'Sons of liberty,' was eagerly adopted by
<PB N="325" REF="023166_0324_0FBC830AB2FCB048">
a&s;&s;ociations in every Colony; determining to carry into execution the prediction of him, who with &s;uch noble energy, had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;pou&s;ed the cau&s;e of our freedom. They began the oppo&s;ition at Bo&s;ton; by pub|licly exhibiting effigies of the enemies of America, and obliging the &s;tamp-officer to re&s;ign his employment. The popular commotions in that town were afterward carried to an unju&s;tifiable exce&s;s; but the &s;pirit of oppo&s;ition animated the body of the people in every Colony.</P>
<P>The per&s;on appointed di&s;tributor of &s;tamps for New-Hamp&s;hire, was George Me&s;&s;erv&egrave;, &s;on of the late Colonel, who died at Loui&s;bourg. He received his ap|pointment in England, and &s;oon after embarked for America, and arrived at Bo&s;|ton. Before he landed, he was informed of the oppo&s;ition which was making to the act;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sept. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE> and that it would be acceptable to the people if he would re&s;ign, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> readily did, and they welcomed him on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hore. An exhibition of effigies at Port&s;|mouth had prepared the minds of the peo|ple there for his reception;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sept. 12.</NOTE> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Sept. 18.</NOTE> and at his coming to town he made a &s;econd re&s;ig|nation, on the parade, before he went to his own hou&s;e. This was accepted with the u&s;u|al &s;alutation;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sept. 3<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE> and every one appeared to be &s;atisfied with the &s;ucce&s;s of the popular
<PB N="326" REF="023166_0325_0FBC830BF46792B8">
mea&s;ures. Soon after, the &s;tamped paper de&s;tined for New-Hamp&s;hire arrived at Bo&s;ton in the &s;ame ve&s;&s;el with that in|tended for Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts; but there being no per&s;on in either Province who had any concern with it, it was, by order of Gover|nor Bernard, lodged in the ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>The &s;tamp-act was to commence its operation on the fir&s;t day of November; previou&s;ly to which the appointed Con|gre&s;s was formed at New-York, con&s;i&s;ting of delegates from the A&s;&s;emblies of Ma&s;&s;a|chu&s;etts, Rhode-I&s;land, Connecticut, New-York, New-Jer&s;ey, Penn&s;ylvania, the Del|aware Counties, Maryland and South-Carolina. Having, like the Congre&s;s at Albany in 1754, formed them&s;elves in geographical order; they framed a bill of rights, for the Colonies; in which the &s;ole power of taxation was declared to be in their own a&s;&s;emblies. They prepared three di&s;tinct addre&s;&s;es to the King, Lords and Commons, &s;tating their grievances, and a&s;king for redre&s;s. The&s;e were &s;ub|&s;cribed by the delegates of &s;ix Colonies; the others who were pre&s;ent were not em|powered to &s;ign; but reported their pro|ceedings to their con&s;tituents, who ap|proved them in A&s;&s;embly, and forwarded their petitions. No delegates went from New-Hamp&s;hire to this Congre&s;s; but
<PB N="327" REF="023166_0326_0FBC830FD1987888">
the A&s;&s;embly at their next meeting adopt|ed the &s;ame mea&s;ures, and &s;ent &s;imilar pe|titions to England, which they committed to Barlow Trecothick, their agent,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A&s;&s;embly Records.</NOTE> and John Wentworth, a young gentleman of Port&s;mouth, who was then in England, to be by them pre&s;ented to the King and Parliament. The&s;e mea&s;ures were the mo&s;t re&s;pectful and prudent which could be devi&s;ed; and were attended with &s;ome pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s from a change which had been made in the Briti&s;h mini&s;try.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the new&s;papers were filled with e&s;&s;ays, in which every plea for and again&s;t the new duties was amply di&s;|cu&s;&s;ed. The&s;e vehicles of intelligence were doomed to be loaded with a &s;tamp; and the printers felt them&s;elves intere&s;ted in the oppo&s;ition. On the la&s;t day of October, the New-Hamp&s;hire Gazette appeared with a mourning border. A body of people from the country approach|ed the town of Port&s;mouth, under an ap|prehen&s;ion that the &s;tamps would be di&s;|tributed; but being met, by a number from the town, and a&s;&s;ured that no &s;uch thing was intended, they quietly returned. The next day, the bells tolled, and a fu|neral proce&s;&s;ion was made for the Godde&s;s of Liberty;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 1.</NOTE> but on depo&s;iting her in the
<PB N="328" REF="023166_0327_0FBC831130F2CEB8">
grave, &s;ome &s;igns of life were &s;uppo&s;ed to be di&s;covered, and &s;he was carried off in triumph. By &s;uch exhibitions, the &s;pirit of the populace was kept up; though the minds of the mo&s;t thoughtful per&s;ons were filled with anxiety.</P>
<P>It was doubtful, whether the Courts of Law could proceed without &s;tamps; and it was certain that none could be procured. Some licentious per&s;ons began to think that debts could not be recovered, and that they might in&s;ult their creditors with impunity. On the fir&s;t appearance of this di&s;orderly &s;pirit, a&s;&s;ociations were formed at Port&s;mouth, Exeter and other places, to &s;upport the Magi&s;trates and pre|&s;erve the peace. The fifth of November had always been ob&s;erved as a day of hi|larity, in remembrance of the powder-plot. On the following night, a &s;trong guard was kept in Port&s;mouth. By the&s;e precautions, the tendency to riot was &s;ea|&s;onably checked, and no wa&s;te of property or per&s;onal in&s;ult was committed; though &s;ome obnoxious characters began to trem|ble for their &s;afety.</P>
<P>When Me&s;&s;erv&egrave; arrived, the people &s;up|po&s;ed that he had brought his commi&s;&s;ion with him, and were content that it &s;hould remain in his own hands, being rendered
<PB N="329" REF="023166_0328_0FBC83132151A5D8">
void by his re&s;ignation. But, in fact, he did not receive it till after the time fixed for the operation of the act. Hav|ing &s;hown his in&s;tructions to the Gover|nor, and &s;ome other public officers, it was &s;u&s;pected that he intended
<Q>to commence the execution of his office.</Q>
The &s;ons of liberty were alarmed;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1766.</NOTE> they a&s;&s;embled by beat of drum,<NOTE PLACE="marg">J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n. 9.</NOTE> and obliged him pub|licly to deliver up his commi&s;&s;ion and in|&s;tructions; which they mounted on the point of a &s;word, and carried in triumph through the town. An oath was admin|i&s;tered to him by Ju&s;tice Claget, purport|ing that he would neither directly nor in|directly attempt to execute his office. The ma&s;ter of a &s;hip, then ready to &s;ail for England, was al&s;o &s;worn to deliver the packet containing the commi&s;&s;ion and in|&s;tructions, as it was directed. It was fir&s;t addre&s;&s;ed to the Commi&s;&s;ioners of the &s;tamp-office in London; but afterward it was enclo&s;ed in a letter to the agents of the Province, refering the di&s;po&s;al of it to their di&s;cretion. It happened to arrive, when great exertions were making, and a &s;trong probability exi&s;ted, of the repeal of the &s;tamp-act. The agents therefore con|cealed the packet, and had the good for|tune to &s;uppre&s;s the intelligence of all
<PB N="330" REF="023166_0329_0FBC831441285B30">
the&s;e proceedings; that no irritation might en&s;ue to prevent the expected re|peal.</P>
<P>During all the&s;e commotions, Governor Wentworth was &s;ilent. The mini&s;try, ei|ther by accident or de&s;ign, had neglected to &s;end authentic copies of the &s;tamp-act, to &s;ome of the American Governors, and to him among others. There had been no tumults, which rendered his interpo&s;i|tion nece&s;&s;ary. He was in the decline of life, and his health was much impaired. His fortune was made, and it lay chiefly in his native country. One of the rea|&s;ons given, for the removal of his prede|ce&s;&s;or, was, that he had enjoyed his office ten years; Mr. Wentworth had been twenty-five years in the chair, and ex|pected &s;oon to be &s;uper&s;eded. It was therefore his intere&s;t, not to put him&s;elf forward in &s;upport of unpopular mea|&s;ures. His example was followed by mo&s;t of the gentlemen in the Province, who held offices under the Crown. If any of them were &s;ecretly in favor of the act, they were re&s;trained by fear, from con|tradicting openly the voice of the people.</P>

All fear of the con&s;equence of proceeding in the public bu&s;ine&s;s without &s;tamps, was gradually laid a&s;ide. The courts of law, and cu&s;tom hou&s;es were kept open. Newspapers circulated, and licen&s;es for marriage, without &s;tamps, were publicly adverti&s;ed. As it was uncertain, what might be the event of the petitions to the King and Parliament, it was thought be&s;t, to awaken the attention of the merchants and manufacturers of England, by an a|greement to import no goods, until the &s;tamp-act &s;hould be repealed. To pro|vide for the wor&s;t, an a&s;&s;ociation was formed by the '&s;ons of liberty' in all the northern Colonies, to &s;tand by each other, and unite their whole force, for the pro|tection and relief of any who might be in danger, from the operation of this, or any other oppre&s;&s;ive act. The letters which pa&s;&s;ed between them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">MS letters of the &s;ons of liberty.</NOTE> on this occa|&s;ion, are replete with expre&s;&s;ions of loyal|ty and affection to the King, his per&s;on, family and authority. Had there been any di&s;affection to the royal government, or de&s;ire to &s;hake off our allegiance, where would the evidence of it be more likely to be found, than in letters which pa&s;&s;ed be|tween bodies of men, who were avowedly endeavoring, to form an union, to re&s;i&s;t

<P>The idea which we entertained of our political connexion with the Briti&s;h em|pire, was, that the King was its &s;upreme head; that every branch of it was a per|fect State, competent to its own internal legi&s;lation, but &s;ubject to the control and negative of the &s;overeign; that taxation and repre&s;entation were correlative, and therefore that no part of the empire could be taxed, but by its own Repre&s;entatives in A&s;&s;embly. From a regard to the gen|eral intere&s;t, it was conceded, that the Par|liament of Great-Britain, repre&s;enting the fir&s;t and mo&s;t powerful branch of the em|pire, might regulate the exterior com|merce of the whole. In Britain, the A|merican governments were con&s;idered as corporations, exi&s;ting by the plea&s;ure of the King and Parliament, who had a right to alter or di&s;&s;olve them. Our laws were deemed bye-laws; and we were &s;up|po&s;ed to be, in all ca&s;es of legi&s;lation and
<PB N="333" REF="023166_0332_0FBC831B07A6E490">
taxation, &s;ubject to the &s;upreme, undefin|ed power of the Briti&s;h Parliament. Be|tween claims &s;o widely different, there was no arbitrator to decide. Temporary expedients, if wi&s;ely applied, might have pre&s;erved peace; but the mo&s;t delicate and judicious management was nece&s;&s;ary, to prevent irritation.</P>
<P>When the commotions which had hap|pened in America, were known in Eng|land, a circular letter was written to the &s;everal governors, by Secretary Conway,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Oct. 24. 1765.</NOTE> in which it was
<Q><HI>hoped</HI> that the re&s;i&s;tance to the authority of the mother country, had only found place among the lower and more ignorant of the people.</Q>
To the con&s;titutional authority (as we under&s;tood it) of the King and Parliament, there had been no re&s;i&s;tance; but to the a&s;&s;umed authority, of our fellow &s;ubjects in Britain, over our property, the re&s;i&s;t|ance began, and was &s;upported by the Repre&s;entatives of the people, in their A&s;|&s;emblies. Tho&s;e who appeared under the name of 'the &s;ons of liberty' were chiefly trade&s;men of reputation, who were occa|&s;ionally a&s;&s;i&s;ted by lawyers, clergymen, and other per&s;ons of literary abilities. The writings of Sydney and Locke were produced, in evidence of the ju&s;tice of our
<PB N="334" REF="023166_0333_0FBC831C798A1A40">
claims; and the arguments which had for|merly been u&s;ed in England, again&s;t the u&s;urpations of the hou&s;e of Stuart, were adopted and repeated by us, in favor of our rights and liberties. Political inquiries were encouraged, and the eyes of the people were opened. Never was a &s;enti|ment more generally adopted, on the full|e&s;t conviction, than that we could be con|&s;titutionally taxed by none but our own Repre&s;entatives; and that all a&s;&s;umption of this power, by any other body of men, was u&s;urpation which might be lawfully re&s;i&s;ted.</P>
<P>The petitions of the American A&s;&s;em|blies, enforced by the agreement for non-importation, and aided by the exertions of the Briti&s;h merchants and manufactur|ers, induced the new mini&s;try to recom|mend to Parliament, a repeal of the odi|ous &s;tamp-act.<NOTE PLACE="marg">March 18.</NOTE> It was accordingly re|pealed; not on the true principle of its repugnancy to the rights of America; but on that of political expediency. Even on this principle, the repeal could be obtained by no other means; than by pa&s;&s;ing, at the &s;ame time, a declaratory act, a&s;&s;erting the right and power, of the Briti&s;h Parliament,
<Q>to <HI>bind</HI> America, in all ca&s;es what&s;oever,</Q>

the re&s;olutions of our A&s;&s;emblies, in which they had claimed the right of exemption from Parliamentary taxation.</P>
<P>The rejoicings which were occa&s;ioned by the repeal of the &s;tamp-act, in this country, were extravagantly di&s;propor|tioned to the object. We felt a tran&s;ient relief from an intolerable burden; but the claim of &s;overeign power, in our fellow &s;ubjects, to take our property, and abridge our liberty at their plea&s;ure, was e&s;tabli&s;h|ed by law. Our only hope was, that they would profit by their recent experi|ence; and whil&s;t they enjoyed the pride of &s;eeing their claim exi&s;t on paper, would &s;u&s;pend the exerci&s;e of it in future.</P>
<P>With the repealing and declaratory acts, a circular letter came from Secretary Conway; in which,
<Q>the lenity and ten|derne&s;s, the moderation and forbearance of the Parliament toward the Colonies</Q>
were celebrated in the language of pane|gyric, and we were called upon, to &s;how our
<Q>re&s;pectful gratitude and cheerful obedience,</Q>
in return for &s;uch a

This letter enclo&s;ed a re&s;olution of Parli|ament, that tho&s;e per&s;ons who had

<P>When Governor Wentworth laid this letter before the A&s;&s;embly, he told them
<Q>with plea&s;ure and &s;atisfaction,<NOTE PLACE="marg">June 25.</NOTE> that he had <HI>no</HI> requi&s;ition of this kind to make.</Q>
Me&s;&s;erv&egrave;, however, applied to the A&s;&s;em|bly to grant him a compen&s;ation for the injuries which he &s;aid he had &s;uffered. A committee, being appointed to inquire in|to the ground of his petition, reported,
<Q>that he had &s;uffered no real damage either in per&s;on or property; but that when any danger had been expected, guards had been appointed to protect him.</Q>
Upon this report, his petition was di&s;mi&s;&s;|ed. He afterward went to England and obtained the office of Collector of the the Cu&s;toms.</P>
<P>At this &s;e&s;&s;ion, the A&s;&s;embly prepared a re&s;pectful addre&s;s to the King and both Hou&s;es of Parliament, on account of the repeal; which was &s;ent to England, at the &s;ame time that the &s;tamped paper and parchment, which had been depo&s;ited at ca&s;tle in Bo&s;ton, were returned.</P>

He had al&s;o been accu&s;ed of negligence in corre&s;ponding with the King's mini&s;ters; of informality and want of accuracy in his grants of land; and of pa&s;&s;ing acts of A&s;&s;embly re&s;pecting private property, with|out a &s;u&s;pending clau&s;e
<Q>till his Maje&s;ty's plea&s;ure could be known.</Q>
In his of|fice of Surveyor-General he had been charged with neglect of duty, and with indulging his deputies in &s;elling and wa&s;t|ing the King's timber. By whom the&s;e complaints were made, and by what evi|dence they were &s;upported, I have not been able to di&s;cover. Certain it is, that &s;uch an impre&s;&s;ion was made on the minds of the mini&s;try, that a re&s;olution was ta|ken to remove him; but the difficulties attending the &s;tamp-act, cau&s;ed a delay in the appointment of a &s;ucce&s;&s;or. When the ferment had &s;ub&s;ided, the attention of the mini&s;try was turned to this object. JOHN WENTWORTH, &s;on of Mark Hunk|ing Wentworth, and nephew of the Gov|ernor, was then in England. He had ap|peared

at Court, as a joint agent with Mr. Trecothick in pre&s;enting the petition of the Province again&s;t the &s;tamp-act. He had become acquainted with &s;everal families of high rank and of his own name, in York&s;hire, and in particular with the Marquis of Rockingham, then at the head of the mini&s;try. By his in|dulgence, Mr. Wentworth prevailed to &s;often the rigor of government again&s;t his uncle. In&s;tead of being cen&s;ured and re|moved from office, he was allowed oppor|tunity to <HI>re&s;ign,</HI> and the appearance of re|&s;igning in favor of his nephew, who was de&s;tined by the Marquis, to be his &s;ucce&s;|&s;or.

This ap|pointment,<NOTE PLACE="marg">June 13.</NOTE> made by a popular mini&s;try, was peculiarly grateful to the people of New-Hamp&s;hire, by whom Mr. Went|worth was well known and much e&s;teem|ed.</P>
<P><PB N="339" REF="023166_0338_0FBC83299D8EE500">In addition to what has been &s;aid, of the &s;uper&s;eded Governor, it may be ob|&s;erved; that his natural abilities were nei|ther brilliant nor contemptible. As a private gentleman he was obliging, and as a merchant honorable. He was gene|rous and ho&s;pitable to his friends; but his pa&s;&s;ions were &s;trong and his re&s;ent|ments la&s;ting. He was &s;ubject to fre|quent and long continued vi&s;its of the gout; a di&s;temper rather unfriendly to the vir|tue of patience. In his deportment there was an appearance of haughtine&s;s, con|tracted by his re&s;idence in Spain, where he learned the manners of the people of rank; as well as the maxims of their gov|ernment. He thought it be&s;t that the highe&s;t offices, &s;hould be filled with men of property; and though in &s;ome in&s;tan|ces he deviated from this principle, yet, in others, he adhered to it &s;o clo&s;ely, as to di&s;regard more nece&s;&s;ary qualifications.</P>
<P>In the former part of his admini&s;tra|tion, he was &s;crupulous in obeying his in&s;tructions, and inflexible in maintaining the prerogative. In conducting the ope|rations of two &s;ucce&s;&s;ive wars, his atten|tion to the &s;ervice was very con&s;picuous; and he frequently received letters of thanks, from the Generals, and other of|ficers

A project was formed during his admini&s;tration, to e&s;tab|li&s;h a college in New-Hamp&s;hire. When he was applied to for a charter, he declin|ed giving it, unle&s;s the college were put under the direction of the Bi&s;hop of Lon|don. But, when a grant was made by the A&s;&s;embly, of three hundred pounds &s;terling, to Harvard College, where he had received his education, to repair the de|&s;truction which it had &s;uffered by fire; he con&s;ented to the vote, and his name is in&s;cribed on an alcove of the library, as a benefactor, in conjunction with the name of the Province.</P>
<P>In his appointment of civil and milita|ry officers, he was frequently governed by motives of favor, or prejudice to par|ticular per&s;ons.

tax on <HI>tea</HI> was re&s;erved as a latent &s;park to rekindle the controver&s;y.</P>
<P>When the Governor, at his fir&s;t meet|ing the A&s;&s;embly, according to the cu&s;tom on &s;uch occa&s;ions, recommended to them the e&s;tabli&s;hment of an 'adequate, honor|able and permanent &s;alary,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Journal of A&s;&s;embly.</NOTE>' they made &s;ome he&s;itation, on account of a report, that the &s;alaries of the American Govern|ors were to be paid out of the revenue. On being a&s;&s;ured, that if &s;uch a general e&s;tabli&s;hment &s;hould take place, it would be &s;o guarded as to prevent his receiving any reward from the A&s;&s;embly; they fram|ed a vote, granting &s;even hundred pounds per annum during his admini&s;tration (dol|lars being then fixed at &s;ix &s;hillings.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sept. 30.</NOTE>) The fund appropriated to the &s;alary was the exci&s;e, and in ca&s;e of its in&s;ufficiency, oth|er provi&s;ion was made. But the vote was limited with an exception,
<Q>unle&s;s provi|&s;ion &s;hall be made by Parliament.</Q>
When the que&s;tion was put, the Hou&s;e was equal|ly divided, and the Speaker, Peter Gilman, turned it again&s;t a permanent &s;alary. It was therefore voted from year to year, and generally amounted to &s;even hundred pounds; be&s;ides which an allowance was made for hou&s;e-rent, from &s;ixty or &s;eventy to one hundred pounds.</P>
<P><PB N="349" REF="023166_0348_0FBC833CEB014318">Among the improvements which, dur|ing this admini&s;tration, were made in the Province, one of the mo&s;t con&s;picuous, was the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a &s;eminary of lite|rature. It was founded on a projection of Doctor Eleazer Wheelock, of Lebanon in Connecticut, for the removal of his Indian charity &s;chool.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t de&s;ign of a &s;chool of this kind was conceived by Mr. John Sergeant, Mi&s;&s;ionary to the Indians at Stockbridge.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hopkins's memoirs of the Hou&s;a|tonnock Indians, 1736.</NOTE> A rambling mode of life, and a total want of letters, were ever unfriendly to the prop|agation of religious knowledge among the &s;avages of America. That worthy mi&s;&s;i|onary, intent on the bu&s;ine&s;s of his pro|fe&s;&s;ion, and having ob&s;erved the progre&s;s made by &s;ome of the younger Indians, who re&s;ided in the Engli&s;h families, in reading and other improvements, conceiv|ed the benevolent idea of changing their whole habit of thinking and acting; and rai&s;ing them from their native indolence to a &s;tate of civilization; and at the &s;ame time, by introducing the Engli&s;h language, in&s;tead of their own barren dialect, to in|&s;til into their minds the principles of mo|rality and religion.</P>
<P>To accompli&s;h this de&s;ign, he procured benefactions from many well di&s;po&s;ed per&s;ons both here and in England; and
<PB N="350" REF="023166_0349_0FBC833F9838AB18">
began a &s;chool at Stockbridge; where the Indian youth were to be maintained, un|der the in&s;truction of two ma&s;ters; one to over&s;ee their &s;tudies, and the other their field labor; whil&s;t a matron &s;hould direct the female children in acquiring the arts of dome&s;tic life.<NOTE PLACE="marg">(1749)</NOTE> Death put an end to the labors of this excellent man before his plan could be accompli&s;hed.</P>
<P>This de&s;ign was revived by Wheelock. Having made &s;ome experiments, he was encouraged to proceed, by the tractable di&s;po&s;ition of the Indian youths,<NOTE PLACE="marg">(1754)</NOTE> and their proficiency in learning; but e&s;pecially, by the numerous benefactions, which he re|ceived from the friends of religion and humanity.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Whee|lock's prin|ted narra|tive.</NOTE> Among which, a donation of Jo&s;hua Moor, of Mansfield, being the larg|e&s;t, in the infancy of the in&s;titution, de|termined its name 'Moor's &s;chool.'</P>
<P>To increa&s;e the means of improvement, charitable contributions were &s;olicited in different parts of America, in England, and in Scotland. The money collected in England, was put into the hands of a Board of Tru&s;tees, of whom the Earl of Dartmouth was at the head; and that collected in Scotland was committed to the &s;ociety for promoting chri&s;tian know|ledge.</P>
<P><PB N="351" REF="023166_0350_0FBC834136AF1D70">As an improvement on the original de&s;ign, a number of Engli&s;h youths were educated with the Indians, both in lite|rary and agricultural exerci&s;es; that their example might invite the Indians to the love of tho&s;e employments, and abate the prejudice which they have univer&s;ally im|bibed, that it is beneath the dignity of man to delve in the earth.</P>
<P>As the number of &s;cholars increa&s;ed, it became nece&s;&s;ary to erect buildings, and extend cultivation. That part of the country in which the &s;chool was fir&s;t placed, being filled with inhabitants, a re|moval was contemplated. When this intention was publicly known, offers were made by private and public per&s;ons in &s;everal of the neighboring Colonies. The wary fore&s;ight of the founder, aided by the advice of the Board of Tru&s;tees, in England, led him to accept an invita|tion made by the Governor, and other gentlemen of New-Hamp&s;hire. The town&s;hip of Hanover, on the ea&s;tern bank of Connecticut river, was finally deter|mined on, as the mo&s;t convenient &s;ituation for the &s;chool; to which the Governor annexed a charter of incorporation for an univer&s;ity,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dec. 13.</NOTE> which took the name of Dart|mouth College, from its benefactor, the
<PB N="352" REF="023166_0351_0FBC8342AFD31A60">
Earl of Dartmouth. Of this univer&s;ity, Doctor Wheelock was declared the found|er and the Pre&s;ident; with power to nom|inate his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, in his la&s;t will. A Board of twelve Tru&s;tees was con&s;tituted, with perpetual &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; and the college was endowed with a large landed e&s;tate, con&s;i&s;ting of one whole town&s;hip (Lan|daff) be&s;ides many other tracts of land, in different &s;ituations, amounting in the whole, to forty-four thou&s;and acres. One valuable lot, of five hundred acres, in the town&s;hip of Hanover, given by the late Governor, Benning Wentworth, was fixed upon as the &s;ite of the &s;chool and college. Be&s;ides the&s;e donations of land, the amount of three hundred and forty pounds &s;terling, was &s;ub&s;cribed, to be paid in labor, provi&s;ions, and materials for building. With the&s;e advantages, and the pro&s;pect of a rapidly increa&s;ing neigh|borhood, in a fertile &s;oil, on both &s;ides of Connecticut river, Doctor Wheelock removed his family and &s;chool into the wilderne&s;s.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770.</NOTE> At fir&s;t, their accommoda|tions were &s;imilar to tho&s;e of other &s;ettlers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">September.</NOTE> on new lands. They built huts of green logs, and lived in them, till a proper edi|fice could be erected. The number of &s;cholars, at this time, was twenty-four;
<PB N="353" REF="023166_0352_0FBC834505CBB808">
of which eighteen were whites, and the re&s;t Indians.</P>
<P>Experience had taught Doctor Whee|lock, that his Indian youths, however well educated, were not to be depended on for in&s;tructors of their countrymen.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Narrative No. 5. p. 20, 21.</NOTE> Of forty who had been under his care, twenty had returned to the vices of &s;avage life; and &s;ome whom he e&s;teemed
<Q>&s;ubjects of di|vine grace, had not kept their garments un&s;potted.</Q>
It was, therefore, in his new, nece&s;&s;ary that a greater proportion of Engli&s;h youths &s;hould be educated, to &s;erve as mi&s;&s;ionaries, and over&s;ee the con|duct of the Indian teachers. This was given as the grand rea&s;on, for uniting the college with the Indian &s;chool, and placing it under the &s;ame government; though the appropriations were di&s;tinctly pre&s;erved. That the general concerns of the in&s;titu|tion might be better regulated, and the intru&s;ion of vicious per&s;ons within the purlieus of the college prevented; a di&s;trict of three miles &s;quare was put un|der its juri&s;diction, and the Pre&s;ident was inve&s;ted with the office of a magi&s;trate. In 1771, a commencement was held, and the fir&s;t degrees were conferred, on four
<PB N="354" REF="023166_0353_0FBC83482890D3A0">
&s;tudents; one of whom was John Whee|lock, the &s;on and &s;ucce&s;&s;or of the founder.</P>
<P>Another improvement was made about the &s;ame time, by dividing the Province into counties. This had been long &s;ought, but could not be obtained. The incon|venience to which the people in the we&s;t|ern parts of the Province were &s;ubject, by rea&s;on of their di&s;tance from Port&s;mouth, where all the Courts were held, was ex|tremely burden&s;ome; whil&s;t the conveni|ence and emoluments of office were enjoy|ed by gentlemen in that vicinity. Some attempts to divide the Province had been made in the former admini&s;tration; but without effect. The rapid increa&s;e of in|habitants for &s;everal years, made a divi&s;ion &s;o nece&s;&s;ary, that it had become one of the principal &s;ubjects of debate, in the A&s;|&s;embly, from the time of the Governor's arrival. Several &s;e&s;&s;ions pa&s;&s;ed before all points could be adju&s;ted. The number of counties, and the lines of divi&s;ion, were not ea&s;ily agreed to, and a punctilio of prerogative about the erecting of Courts, made &s;ome difficulty; but it was finally determined, that the number of counties &s;hould be five; and the Courts were e&s;tab|li&s;hed by an act of the whole legi&s;lature. It was pa&s;&s;ed with a clau&s;e, &s;u&s;pending its
<PB N="355" REF="023166_0354_0FBC834972616E30">
operation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1771.</NOTE> till the King's plea&s;ure &s;hould be known. The royal approbation being obtained, it took effect in 1771. The five counties were named by the Governor, after &s;ome of his friends in England; Rockingham, Strafford, Hill&s;borough, Che|&s;hire, and Grafton. The counties of Straf|ford and Grafton being much le&s;s popu|lous, than the others, were to remain an|nexed to the county of Rockingham, till the Governor, by advice of Council, &s;hould declare them competent to the exerci&s;e of their re&s;pective juri&s;dictions; which was done in 1773.</P>
<P>The year 1771 was al&s;o di&s;tingui&s;hed by the abolition of paper currency. Sil|ver and gold had been gradually introduc|ed, and the paper had for &s;everal years been called in by taxes. The time limited for its exi&s;tence being now come, it total|ly di&s;appeared.</P>
<P>The death of the late Governor produc|ed con&s;equences which materially affected his &s;ucce&s;&s;or.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Oct. 14&punc; 1770. Ae|tat 75.</NOTE> This family had been for many years of the fir&s;t rank in the Prov|ince, and &s;ome of its members and connex|ions had held the principal offices. In &s;uch a ca&s;e, dome&s;tic union may be con|&s;idered as nece&s;&s;ary to pre&s;erve public hon|or. The late Governor, though &s;uper&s;ed|ed,
<PB N="356" REF="023166_0355_0FBC834B008B9660">
had been treated with every mark of re&s;pect; and having no children, it was expected that his &s;ucce&s;&s;or would be his principal heir. A later will, made in fa|vor of his young widow, and unknown till after his death, cau&s;ed a &s;udden di&s;ap|pointment; which, if it had evaporated in private reflections only, might have pa&s;&s;ed among the infirmities incident to humanity, and with them might have been con&s;igned to oblivion; for it is be|neath the dignity of hi&s;tory, to record the altercations of families, unle&s;s they are connected with public tran&s;actions, or events.</P>
<P>Antiquated claims upon the late Gover|nor's e&s;tate were revived; and law-&s;uits were commenced, which probably would not have been agitated, if the expected di&s;po&s;ition had been made. But the mo&s;t alarming effect of this unhappy di&s;appoint|ment was a que&s;tion, which the Governor moved in Council,
<Q>whether the re&s;erva|tions of five hundred acres, in &s;everal town&s;hips,<NOTE PLACE="marg">March 19.</NOTE> made by the late Governor, Benning Wentworth,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 paragraph"></NOTE> in the charter grants, conveyed the title to him?</Q>
The Council determined this que&s;tion in the negative. The Governor then a&s;ked, whether they would advi&s;e him to grant
<PB N="357" REF="023166_0356_0FBC834C8FFE4CA0">
the &s;aid tracts, to &s;uch of his Maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects, as &s;hould &s;ettle and cultivate the &s;ame? To this they gave their a&s;&s;ent. Seven of the Coun&s;ellors pre&s;ent on this occa&s;ion were the Governor's relations. The eighth was Peter Livius, a gentle|man of foreign extraction, who entered his di&s;&s;ent. He had for &s;everal years &s;erv|ed as a Ju&s;tice of the Common Pleas; but on the divi&s;ion of the Province into coun|ties, it was nece&s;&s;ary to i&s;&s;ue new commi&s;|&s;ions. Finding him&s;elf overlooked in the appointment of officers, and his private affairs calling him abroad, he &s;ailed for England, and there exhibited to the Lords of Trade,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1772.</NOTE> articles of complaint again&s;t the Governor and his Council.<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 9.</NOTE></P>
<P>The fir&s;t was, that the Governor and Council, without any legal proce&s;s,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Printed compl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">n.</NOTE> or the intervention of a jury, had deprived the grantees under the Crown of their lands, on &s;ugge&s;tion only that the conditions had not been fulfilled.</P>
<P>The &s;econd was, that the duty paid by foreign &s;hipping, commonly called pow|der money, had not been accounted for, &s;ince the year 1741; and that the Council had refu&s;ed to join with the Repre&s;enta|tives in an inquiry into this matter in the year 1768.</P>
<P><PB N="358" REF="023166_0357_0FBC83515BE78630">The third was, that the Governor had moved in Council, that the lands re&s;erved to the late Governor, in the charters of town&s;hips, &s;hould be regranted to him&s;elf, through the medium of another per&s;on; and that the prote&s;t of the complainant, again&s;t the legality of this proceeding, was rejected.</P>
<P>The fourth was, that in con&s;equence of the oppo&s;ition, which he was in duty bound thus to make, he had been injuri|ou&s;ly treated, and had received per&s;onal abu&s;e from the Governor.</P>
<P>The fifth was, that pending an action in the Common Pleas, brought by the Gover|nor, though in other names, the Judges had &s;everal times been changed, till a que&s;tion on a point of law was determined in favor of the Governor.</P>
<P>The &s;ixth article &s;tated, that the com|plainant had expected to prove &s;everal of the above facts, by referring to copies of the Council records in their Lord&s;hip's office; but was &s;urpri&s;ed to find that the Governor had di&s;obeyed his in&s;tructions in not &s;ending them.</P>
<P>The memorial concluded with a gene|ral charge or partiality ari&s;ing from the family connexions of the Governor and Council.</P>
<P><PB N="359" REF="023166_0358_0FBC8353311A4448">Copies of this memorial were &s;ent to the Governor and Council, who &s;eparately prepared and returned di&s;tinct an&s;wers to the &s;everal articles of complaint.<NOTE PLACE="marg">MS copies.</NOTE></P>
<P>To the fir&s;t, it was &s;aid, that the re|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">umption of grants forfeited by non-com|pliance with the conditions of &s;ettlement was &s;upported by the opinion of the At|torney and Solicitor General, given in 1752; that the invariable u&s;age in the&s;e ca&s;es, had been to i&s;&s;ue notice to delinquent proprietors, that they &s;hould appear on a &s;et day, and &s;hew cau&s;e why their &s;hares &s;hould not be forfeited and regranted; that their allegations had been always treated with proper re&s;pect, and that no complaint of inju&s;tice had been made by any per&s;ons who&s;e grants had been thus re&s;umed.</P>
<P>To the &s;econd it was an&s;wered, that the amount of powder-money, during the former admini&s;tration, though long neg|lected, had been lately recovered; and that &s;ince 1768, it had been regularly ac|counted for. The rea&s;on for the non|concurrence of the Council, with the vote for inquiring into this matter, was their re&s;pect to the royal prerogative, conceiv|ing that the Hou&s;e had no concern with the matter.</P>
<P><PB N="360" REF="023166_0359_0FBC8354DDC6F0A8">To the third article, it was &s;aid, that the late Governor, con&s;cious of the in&s;uf|ficiency of his title, had &s;olicited his &s;uc|ce&s;&s;or for grants of the&s;e re&s;ervations, which he had declined giving, unle&s;s a mandamus from the King could be pro|cured; that this uncertainty had prevented his alienating them; that in con&s;equence, they were uncultivated and forfeited; that &s;ome of the&s;e lands had been regranted to other per&s;ons; but that the pre&s;ent Gover|nor had no intere&s;t directly or indirectly in them. The Council denied, that the Gov|ernor had ever propo&s;ed the granting of the&s;e lands to him&s;elf, through another per&s;on. They al&s;o denied that the di&s;&s;ent of the memoriali&s;t had been refu&s;ed.</P>
<P>The charge of per&s;onal abu&s;e, in the fourth article, was contradicted and re|torted; but it was conceded, that the Governor had told him that his rea&s;ons of di&s;&s;ent were not founded in truth.</P>
<P>In an&s;wer to the fifth article, it was acknowledged, that the action was brought for the Governor's benefit; but that any unfair means were u&s;ed to influence the Court was denied. This denial was cor|roborated by the depo&s;itions of the Judges them&s;elves, and of the Attorneys who were concerned in the &s;uit. It was al&s;o proved
<PB N="361" REF="023166_0360_0FBC8356337C86D8">
that the judgment of the Court on the que&s;tion of law, was of no moment, being rever&s;ed by the Superior Court, before which the cau&s;e was carried by appeal.</P>
<P>To the &s;ixth article, it was an&s;wered, that the Governor had directed the Secre|tary to furni&s;h him with copies of all the public tran&s;actions which had u&s;ually been &s;ent to England, and that he had re|gularly tran&s;mitted them. But it appear|ed from the affidavit of the Secretary, that in June 1760, the late Governor had or|dered him not to tran&s;cribe the minutes of the Council, when &s;itting without the A&s;&s;embly, unle&s;s &s;pecially directed; and &s;ince that time it had been u&s;ual to &s;end the journal of the Council when &s;it|ting as a Hou&s;e of A&s;&s;embly, and not as a Council of State.</P>
<P>In fine, the Council denied that they had ever acted, in their public capacity, from any private or family intere&s;t; but a&s;|&s;erted, that they had frequently given their judgment directly again&s;t it; and they concluded with very &s;evere reflections on the complainant.</P>

<P>When the cau&s;e was reheard before a committee of the Privy Council, it was ob&s;erved by the Governor's advocate,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> 29.</NOTE> that

<P>'That by the law of England, when <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">nds were granted, upon condition, the breach of that condition mu&s;t be found by a jury under a commi&s;&s;ion from the Court of Chancery; but that no &s;uch Court exi&s;ted in New-Hamp&s;hire; and though the general rule was that the law of England extended to the Colonies, yet it mu&s;t be under&s;tood to mean, &s;uch part of the law as is adapted to the &s;tate and con&s;titution of them. That though the Governor had re&s;umed and regranted lands, yet there was no evidence that &s;uch re|&s;umptions had been made without proof or public notoriety, that the conditions of former grants had not been complied with; and that no complaint had been made by any per&s;on &s;uppo&s;ed to be injured.

to convey a title; and that the Council was mi&s;taken in thinking otherwi&s;e. That the Governor, by their advice, did re&s;ume and regrant &s;everal tracts of land which had been granted to the late Governor; but it had not been proved that the &s;aid lands were regranted in tru&s;t for him&s;elf; and in many in&s;tances &s;uch lands were regranted to different inhabitants for their own u&s;e and benefit; and that the late Governor's widow had not complained of any injury, by &s;uch re&s;umption. That it appeared to have been the con&s;tant practice when any &s;tanding Ju&s;tice of a Court was intere&s;ted in a &s;uit, for a &s;pecial Ju&s;tice to be ap|pointed; that other cau&s;es were depending at the &s;ame Inferior Court of Common Pleas, in which the &s;tanding Ju&s;tices were intere&s;ted, and there was no proof that &s;pecial Ju&s;tices were appointed on account of that particular cau&s;e in which the Gov|enor was concerned; but that the com|mi&s;&s;ion was &s;olicited in the common form; and that the defendant him&s;elf had te&s;tified that he had no objection to the commi&s;&s;ion or to the &s;pecial Ju&s;tices.

<P>In this controver&s;y Mr. Livius met with great &s;upport, from the intere&s;t of tho&s;e who wi&s;hed to di&s;place the Gover|nor; and they became &s;o deeply engaged to him, as to procure for him an appoint|ment to be the Chief Ju&s;tice of New-Hamp&s;hire; but, upon more mature con&s;ideration, this was thought too likely to produce di&s;cord and confu&s;ion, and he obtained an appointment to a more lucra|tive office in the Province of Quebec.</P>
<P>When the final i&s;&s;ue of the complaint was known in New-Hamp&s;hire, a general &s;atisfaction appeared among the people. At the next &s;e&s;&s;ion of the A&s;&s;embly, the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives pre&s;ented to the
<PB N="366" REF="023166_0365_0FBC8360B05E3F78">
Governor, an adddre&s;s of congratulation, in the name of their con&s;tituents; and the citizens of Port&s;mouth gave a &s;plendid ball, to which the Governor and both Hou&s;es of A&s;&s;embly were invited.</P>
<P>Hitherto the Governor had pre&s;erved his popularity; and the people, in general, were &s;atisfied with his admini&s;tration. But, the obligation which lay on him to &s;upport the claims of Britain, and aid the plans of her mini&s;try, rendered his &s;itua|tion extremely delicate, and his populari|ty very precarious. The controver&s;y be|tween Britain and the Colonies was draw|ing to a cri&s;is. By the re&s;ervation of the duty on tea, the Parliament in&s;i&s;ted on it as their right, to tax their American bre|thren without their con&s;ent; and the A|mericans, by withholding the importation of tea from Britain, made u&s;e of the only peaceable mode, in their power, effectual|ly to oppo&s;e that claim. The revenue failed, and the warehou&s;es of the Ea&s;t India company were filled with an un&s;aleable commodity. The mini&s;try and the com|pany, thus &s;everely di&s;appointed, formed a plan, by which it was expected, that the one would enforce their claim, and the other &s;ecure their traffic.</P>
<P><PB N="367" REF="023166_0366_0FBC83645C96B1F0">It was therefore enacted in Parliament, that the duty on the exportation of tea, from Britain, &s;hould be taken off; and the Ea&s;t India company be enabled to &s;end tea, on their own account, to America, &s;ubject to a duty only of three pence on the pound; by which means it would come to us, cheaper than before, or than it could be procured by illicit trade.</P>
<P>This mea&s;ure cau&s;ed a general alarm, through the Colonies; and united the intere&s;t of the merchants, with the views of the politicians, and the general &s;en&s;e of liberty in the people. The trading towns &s;et the example, which the others follow|ed, of pa&s;&s;ing re&s;olves, not to permit tea, freighted by the Ea&s;t India company, to be landed or &s;old. The&s;e re&s;olutions were effectual. In &s;ome places the con|&s;ignees were obliged to relinqui&s;h their appointments, and the tea was returned unladen. In other places it was depo&s;it|ed in &s;tores, till it could be re&s;hipped. In Bo&s;ton, where the ob&s;tinacy of Governor Hutchin&s;on drove the people to de&s;pera|tion, it was de&s;troyed. In New-Hamp+&s;hire, the prudence of Governor Went|worth, the vigilance of the magi&s;trates and the firmne&s;s of the people were com|bined, and the hateful commodity wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">

A town meeting was called, and a propo&s;al was made to Mr. Parry, the con&s;ignee, to re|&s;hip it: To this he con&s;ented. A guard was appointed by order of the town, to watch the cu&s;tom hou&s;e. The tea having been entered, it was nece&s;&s;ary that the duty &s;hould be paid; which was done openly, by the con&s;ignee. The Gover|nor convened the Council, and kept the magi&s;trates and peace officers in readine&s;s to &s;uppre&s;s any riotous appearances; but there was no need of their exertion.

<P>The enemies of America have uniformly cen&s;ured this mea&s;ure as unprecedented, illegal and dangerous.

From the middle of the preceding century, the united Colonies of New-England, held annual, or &s;emiannu|al meetings of Commi&s;&s;ioners, on their common concerns, for above forty years.

and a&s;&s;i&s;ting: That the Lords and Com|mons had addre&s;&s;ed the King, to enforce the revenue-acts, and had a&s;&s;ured him, that they would &s;tand by him, with their lives and fortunes: That the King had de|manded an augmentation of his forces, by &s;ea and land: That the commerce of the New-England Colonies was to be re|&s;trained, and their fi&s;hery prohibited; and that an additional number of troops, hor&s;e and foot, were ordered to America.

He had been informed of a magazine of provi&s;ions and &s;tores, at Concord, laid up
<PB N="382" REF="023166_0381_0FBC83840639F6B0">
by the Provincial Congre&s;s, in ca&s;e of ex|tremity. With the news of the concilia|tory propo&s;ition, he received orders to make an experiment of its &s;ucce&s;s. On the eighteenth day of April,<NOTE PLACE="marg">April 18</NOTE> he i&s;&s;ued writs for calling a general A&s;&s;embly, to comply with the propo&s;ed terms of reconciliation; and in the night following, he privately di&s;patched a body of his troops, to de&s;troy the magazine at Concord; and to &s;eize &s;ome of the leaders of oppo&s;ition, who had retired from the town. He was induced to believe, that if between the i&s;&s;uing of his writs, and the meeting of the A&s;&s;em|bly, he could &s;trike a bold &s;troke; it would &s;o intimidate the people, and unfit them for defence, that they would ea&s;ily comply with the terms propo&s;ed.

<P>On the alarm of this act of ho&s;tility, the people of New-Hamp&s;hire, and of the other Colonies, took arms, and flew to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of their brethren.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding this ill-advi&s;ed and un&s;ucce&s;sful attempt of Gage, Governor Wentworth had very &s;anguine hopes of the good effect of the 'conciliatory propo|&s;ition;' and determined, as he &s;aid,

The Hou&s;e de&s;ired a &s;hort rece&s;s, that they

<P>In the mean time, the officers and men of the Scarborough began to di&s;mantle the fort; they al&s;o &s;topped two ve&s;&s;els la|den with provi&s;ions, which were coming into the harbor; and notwith&s;tanding the mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ing remon&s;trances of the inhabitants, and &s;olicitation of the Gover|nor, refu&s;ed to relea&s;e them. Upon this, a body of armed men, went to a battery on Jerry's point, at Great I&s;land, and took away eight cannon of twenty-four and thirty-two pound &s;hot,<NOTE PLACE="marg">May 26.</NOTE> which they brought up to Port&s;mouth; and whil&s;t they were engaged in this work, the Can&s;eau &s;loop convoyed the two provi&s;ion ve&s;&s;els to Bo&s;|ton, for the &s;upply of the fleet and army.</P>
<P>A new convention was at this time &s;it|ing at Exeter; in which the Province was more fully and equally repre&s;ented, than it ever had been before. They pa&s;|&s;ed votes of thanks to tho&s;e who had ta|ken the powder and guns from the fort, in the preceding winter, and to tho&s;e who had removed the cannon from the battery.

<HEAD>CHAP. XXV. War with Britain. Change of Government. Temporary Con&s;titution. <HI>INDEPENDENCE.</HI> Military exertions. Stark's expedition. Employment of troops during the war.</HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">1775.</NOTE>WHEN the controver&s;y with Britain &s;hewed &s;ymptoms of ho&s;tility, and the de&s;ign of the Mini&s;try and Parliament to provoke us to arms became apparent; the people of New-Hamp&s;hire began &s;eriou&s;ly to meditate the defence of their country. It was uncertain in what man|ner the &s;cene would open; for this and other rea&s;ons no regular plan of opera|tions could be formed. By the old mili|tia law, every male inhabitant, from &s;ix|teen years old to &s;ixty, was obliged to be provided with a mu&s;ket and bayonet, knap|&s;ack, cartridge-box, one pound of powder, twenty bullets and twelve flints. Every town was obliged to keep in readine&s;s one barrel of powder, two hundred pounds of lead and three hundred flints, for every &s;ixty men; be&s;ide a quantity of arms and ammunition for the &s;upply of &s;uch as were not able to provide them&s;elves with the
<PB N="389" REF="023166_0388_0FBC84F4F32FBAB0">
nece&s;&s;ary articles. Even tho&s;e per&s;ons who were exempted from appearing at the common military trainings, were obliged to keep the &s;ame arms and ammunition. In a time of peace, the&s;e requi&s;itions were neglected, and the people in general were not completely furni&s;hed, nor the towns &s;upplied according to law. The care which the Governor had taken to appoint officers of militia and review the regiments, for &s;ome years before, had awakened their at|tention to the duties of the parade; which were performed with renewed ardor, after the provincial convention had recommend|ed the learning of military exerci&s;es and manoeuvres. Voluntary a&s;&s;ociations were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ormed for this purpo&s;e, and the mo&s;t ex|perienced per&s;ons were cho&s;en to com|mand on the&s;e occa&s;ions.

<P>In this &s;tate of anxiety and expectation; when an early &s;pring had invited the hu&s;|bandman to the labor of the field;<NOTE PLACE="marg">April 19.</NOTE> Gene|ral Gage thought it proper to open the

drama of war. The alarm was immedi|ately communicated from town to town through the whole country, and volun|teers flocked from all parts; till a body of ten thou&s;and men a&s;&s;embled in the neigh|borhood of Bo&s;ton, completely inve&s;ted it on the land &s;ide, and cut off all commu|nication with the country.</P>
<P>On the fir&s;t alarm, about twelve hun|dred men marched from the neare&s;t parts of New-Hamp&s;hire, to join their brethren, who had a&s;&s;embled in arms about Bo&s;ton. Of the&s;e, &s;ome returned; others formed them&s;elves into two regiments, under the authority of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts Conven|tion.<NOTE PLACE="marg">May 17.</NOTE> As &s;oon as the Provincial Con|gre&s;s of New-Hamp&s;hire met, they vot|ed to rai&s;e two thou&s;and men, to be formed into three regiments; tho&s;e which were already there to be accounted as two, and another to be inli&s;ted immediately.

<P>It had been a common &s;entiment among the Briti&s;h troops, that the Americans would not dare to fight with them. This battle effectually convinced them of their mi&s;take. They found that fighting with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s was a &s;erious thing; and the lo&s;s which they &s;u&s;tained in this battle, evidently had an influence on their &s;ub&s;equent opera|tions.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t the Scarborough frigate remain|ed in the harbour of Pi&s;cataqua, frequent bickerings happened between her crew and the inhabitants. Captain Berkeley <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eized all inward bound ve&s;&s;els, and &s;ent them to Bo&s;ton. He al&s;o prevented the
<PB N="392" REF="023166_0391_0FBC84FDECFD6CF0">
boats belonging to the river from going out to catch fi&s;h. This conduct was con|formable to the orders which he had re|ceived to execute the re&s;training act. In return, his boats were not permitted to fetch provi&s;ions from the town; and one of them was fired upon in the night, by &s;ome of the guards &s;tationed on the &s;hore. A compromi&s;e, at length, was made be|tween him and the committee of the town; open boats were permitted to pa&s;s, to catch fi&s;h for the inhabitants; and his boats were allowed to take fre&s;h provi&s;ions for the u&s;e of the &s;hip. This agreement &s;ub|&s;i&s;ted but a &s;hort time, and finally all in|tercour&s;e was cut off.</P>
<P>After the departure of the &s;hip, the peo|ple went in volunteer parties,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Augu&s;t 24.</NOTE> under the direction of Major Ezekiel Worthen, whom the convention appointed Engineer, and built forts on the points of two i&s;lands, which form a narrow channel, about a mile below the town of Port&s;|mouth. One of the&s;e was called Fort Wa&s;hington, and the other Fort Sullivan. The cannon which had been &s;aved from the old fort and battery were mounted here, and the town was thought to be &s;e|cure from being &s;urpri&s;ed by &s;hips of war.</P>

The former Trea&s;ur|er, George Jaffrey, E&s;q. was applied to for the public money in his hands, which, to the amount of one thou&s;and five hun|dred and &s;ixteen pounds four &s;hillings and eight pence, he delivered; and Nicholas Gilman, E&s;q. was appointed Trea&s;urer in his room.</P>
<P>During this year, three emi&s;&s;ions of pa|per bills were made. The fir&s;t, of ten thou&s;and and fifty pounds; the &s;econd, of ten thou&s;and pounds; and the third, of twenty thou&s;and pounds. For the amount of tho&s;e &s;ums, the Trea&s;urer gave his ob|ligation in &s;mall notes, which pa&s;&s;ed for a time, as current money, equal in value to &s;ilver and gold. But as emi&s;&s;ions were multiplied, as the redemption of the bills was put off to di&s;tant periods, and the bills them&s;elves were counterfeited, it was impo&s;&s;ible for them long to hold their value.</P>

a company of artillery was rai&s;ed to do duty at the forts. A company of rangers was po&s;ted on Connecticut river; and two companies more were appointed, to be ready to march wherever the commit|tee of &s;afety &s;hould direct. The whole militia was divided into twelve regiments; the field officers were appointed by the convention, and the inferior officers were cho&s;en by the companies. Out of the militia were in&s;i&s;ted four regiments of minute-men, &s;o called, becau&s;e they were to be ready at a minute's warning. They were con&s;tantly trained to military duty, and when called to &s;ervice, were allowed the &s;ame pay as the regiments in the con|tinental army. In the &s;ucceeding winter, when the Connecticut forces had with|drawn from the camp, becau&s;e their time of &s;ervice was expired, &s;ixteen companies of the New-Hamp&s;hire militia, of &s;ixty-one men each, &s;upplied their place, till the Briti&s;h troops evacuated Bo&s;ton.</P>
<P>The convention having been appoint|ed for &s;ix months only; before the expira|tion of that time, applied to the general Congre&s;s for their advice, re&s;pecting &s;ome mode of government for the future. In an&s;wer to which, the Congre&s;s recom|mended

On receiving this advice, the convention took into their con&s;ideration the mode in which a full and free repre|&s;entation &s;hould be called;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 14.</NOTE> and finally agreed, that each elector &s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;s a real e&s;tate of twenty pounds value, and every candidate for election, one of three hundred pounds; that every town, con|&s;i&s;ting of one hundred families, &s;hould &s;end one Repre&s;entative, and one more for every hundred families; and that tho&s;e towns which contained a le&s;s number than one hundred &s;hould be cla&s;&s;ed. They had before ordered a &s;urvey to be made of the number of people in the &s;ev|eral counties; and having obtained it, they determined, that the number of Repre&s;entatives to the next convention, &s;hould bear the following proportion to the number of people, viz.

<PB N="400" REF="023166_0399_0FBC850C315ABC30">
having a&s;&s;umed the name and au|thority of a Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1776.</NOTE> they proceeded to choo&s;e twelve per&s;ons,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jan. 5.</NOTE> to be a di&s;tinct branch of the legi&s;lature, by the name of a Council. Of the&s;e, five were cho&s;en from the county of Rocking|ham, two from Strafford, two from Hill&s;|borough, two from Che&s;hire and one from Grafton. The&s;e were empowered to elect their own Pre&s;ident, and any &s;even of them were to be a quorum. It was or|dained, that no act or re&s;olve &s;hould be valid, unle&s;s pa&s;&s;ed by both branches of the legi&s;lature; that all money bills &s;hould originate in the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives; that neither Hou&s;e &s;hould adjourn for more than two days, without the con&s;ent of the other; that a Secretary, and all oth|er public officers of the Colony, and of each County, for the current year, all general and field officers of militia, and all officers of the marching regiments, &s;hould be appointed by the two Hou&s;es; all &s;ub|ordinate militia officers by their re&s;pective companies; that the pre&s;ent A&s;&s;embly &s;hould &s;ub&s;i&s;t one year, and if the di&s;pute with Britain &s;hould continue longer, and the general Congre&s;s &s;hould give no di|rections to the contrary, that precepts &s;hould be i&s;&s;ued annually to the &s;everal

<P>In this ha&s;ty production, there were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ome material defects. One was the want of an executive branch of government. To remedy this, the two Hou&s;es, during their &s;e&s;&s;ion, performed executive as well as legi&s;lative duty; and at every adjourn|ment appointed a committee of &s;afety, to fit in the rece&s;s, with the &s;ame powers, as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ad been given in the preceding year, by the convention. The number of this committee varied from &s;ix to &s;ixteen. The Pre&s;ident of the Council was al&s;o Pre&s;ident of this executive Committee. The per&s;on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ho&s;en to fill this chair was an old, tried, faithful &s;ervant of the public, the honora|ble MESHECH WEARE, E&s;q. who was al&s;o appointed Chief Ju&s;tice of the Superior Court. So great was the confidence of the people in this gentleman, that they &s;crupled not to inve&s;t him, at the &s;ame time, with the highe&s;t offices, legi&s;lative, executive, and judicial; in which he was continued by annual elections during the whole war.</P>
<P>This con&s;titution was prefaced with &s;ev|eral rea&s;ons for adopting government, viz.
<PB N="402" REF="023166_0401_0FBC8511B93F1338">
That the Briti&s;h Parliament had, by ma|ny grievous and oppre&s;&s;ive acts, deprived us of our native rights; to enforce obe|dience of our native rights; to enforce obe|dience to which acts, the mini&s;try of that kingdom had &s;ent a powerful fleet and army into this country, and had wanton|ly and cruelly abu&s;ed their power, in de&s;troying our lives and property; that the &s;udden and abrupt departure of our late Governor, had left us de&s;titute of le|gi&s;lation; that no judicial Courts were open to puni&s;h offenders; and that the continental Congre&s;s had recommended the adoption of a form of government. Upon the&s;e grounds the convention made a declaration in the&s;e words,

The&s;e &s;enti|ments, being &s;et in their ju&s;t light by vari|ous publications and addre&s;&s;es, had &s;uch force as to produce a total change of the public opinion.

In an arrangement of general officers, in the preceding year, a junior officer had been promoted, whil&s;t he was neglect|ed. He had written on this &s;ubject to Congre&s;s, and his letters were laid on the table. He therefore quitted the army, and retired to his own e&s;tate. He was now by the unanimous voice of his fellow-citizens, inve&s;ted with a &s;eparate command, and re|ceived orders to

Stark informed him of his orders, and of the danger which the inhabitants of the Grants apprehended from the enemy, and from their di&s;affected neighbours; that he had con&s;ulted with the committee, and that it was the determination of the peo|ple, in ca&s;e he &s;hould join the Continental army and leave them expo&s;ed, that they would retire to the ea&s;t of Connecticut river; in which ca&s;e New-Hamp&s;hire would be a frontier.

<P>On the following morning Stark was joined by a company of militia from the Grants,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. 16.</NOTE> and another from the county of Berk&s;hire in Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts.

<P>Ju&s;t at this in&s;tant, he received intelli|gence that another body of the enemy was within two miles of him. This was a reinforcement for which Baum had &s;ent, when he fir&s;t knew the force which he was to oppo&s;e. It was commanded by Col. Breyman. Happily Warner's regi|ment from Manche&s;ter came up with them and &s;topped them. Stark rallied his men and renewed the action; it was warm and de&s;perate; he u&s;ed, with &s;ucce&s;s, the can|non which he had taken; and at &s;un&s;et obliged the enemy to retreat. He pur&s;ued them till night, and then halted, to pre|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ent his own men from killing each other, in the dark. He took from the enemy two other pieces of cannon, with all their baggage, waggons and hor&s;es. Two hun|dred and twenty-&s;ix men were found dead on the field. Their commander, Baum, was taken and died of his wounds; be&s;ide whom, thirty-three officers, and above &s;even hundred privates, were made pri&s;on|ers. Of Stark's brigade four officers and

<P>In the account of this battle, which Stark &s;ent to the committee of New-Hamp|&s;hire,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">g. 18.</NOTE> he &s;aid,

He was &s;en&s;ible of the advantage of keeping on the flank of the enemy's main body; and therefore &s;ent for one thou&s;and men to replace tho&s;e who&s;e time had expired; but intimated to the committee that he him&s;elf &s;hould re|turn with the brigade. They cordially thanked him
<Q>for the very e&s;&s;ential &s;ervice which he had done to the country,</Q>
but earne&s;tly pre&s;&s;ed him to continue in the command; and &s;ent him a reinforcement,
<Q>a&s;&s;uring the men that they were to &s;erve under General Stark.</Q>
This argument prevailed with the men to march, and with Stark to remain.</P>
<P>The pri&s;oners taken in this battle were &s;ent to Bo&s;ton. The trophies were divid|ed between New-Hamp&s;hire and Ma&s;&s;a|chu&s;etts. But Congre&s;s heard of this vic|tory by accident. Having waited &s;ome time in expectation of letters, and none arriving&punc; inquiry was made why Stark

had not written to Congre&s;s? He an&s;wer|ed, that his corre&s;pondence with them was clo&s;ed, as they had not attended to his la&s;t letters. They took the hint; and though they had but a few days before re&s;olved, that the in&s;tructions which he had received were de&s;tructive of military &s;ubordination, and prejudicial to the common cau&s;e; yet they pre&s;ented their thanks to him, and to the officers and troops under his com|mand, and promoted him to the rank of a Brigadier General, in the army of the United States.</P>
<P>This victory gave a &s;evere check to the hopes of the enemy, and rai&s;ed the &s;pirits of the people after long depre&s;&s;ion. It whol|ly changed the face of affairs in the north|ern department. In&s;tead of di&s;appoint|ment and retreat, and the lo&s;s of men by hard labor and &s;ickne&s;s; we now were convinced, not only that our militia could fight without being covered by intrench|ments; but that they were able, even with|out artillery, to cope with regular troops in their intrenchments. The &s;ucce&s;s thus gained was regarded as a good omen of farther advantages.

<PB N="420" REF="023166_0419_0FBC853100466770">
and we determined that no exertion &s;hould be wanting on our part to com|plete the ruin of his boa&s;ted enterpri&s;e. The northern army was reinforced by the militia of all the neighbouring States. Brigadier Whipple marched with a great part of his brigade; be&s;ides which, volun|teers in abundance from every part of New-Hamp&s;hire flew to the army under General Gates. Two de&s;perate battles were fought, the one at Stillwater and the other at Saratoga; in both of which, the troops of New-Hamp&s;hire had a large &s;hare of the honor due to the American army. In the former action, two Lieuten|ant Colonels, Adams and Colburne, and Lieutenant Thomas, were &s;lain in the field; and &s;everal other brave officers were wounded, one of whom, Captain Bell, died in the ho&s;pital. In the latter, Lieut. Col. Conner and Lieut. McClary were killed, with a great number of their men; and Col. Scammel was wounded. The con|&s;equence of the&s;e battles was the &s;urren|der of Burgoyne's army. This grand object being attained, the New-Hamp|&s;hire regiments performed a march of forty miles, and forded the Mohawk river, below the falls, in the &s;pace of four|teen hours. The de&s;ign of this rapid

movement was to check the progre&s;s of a detachment, commanded by the Briti&s;h General Clinton; who threatened Albany with the &s;ame de&s;truction which he had &s;pread in the country below; but on hear|ing the fate of Burgoyne, he returned quietly to New-York. The regiments then marched into Penn&s;ylvania and pa&s;&s;ed the winter in huts at Valley-&s;orge.

In the battle of Monmouth, a part of them were clo&s;ely engaged, under the conduct of Col. Cilley and Lieut. Col. Dearborn; and behaved with &s;uch bravery as to merit the particular approbation of their illu&s;trious General. They continu|ed with the main body, all that campaign, and were hutted, in the following winter, at Reading.</P>

<P>THE war in which we became involv|ed with Britain, found us not de&s;|titute of re&s;ources, but un&s;killed in the art of finance. Former wars had been maintained by a paper currency; which, though it depreciated in &s;ome mea&s;ure, yet was finally redeemed by the reimbur&s;e|ments which we received from the Briti&s;h Trea&s;ury. We had been al&s;o u&s;ed to i&s;&s;ue bills on loan, and receive landed property as &s;ecurity for its redemption. To the &s;ame mode we had recour&s;e on this occa|&s;ion, without either of the foundations on which our former currencies had been &s;upported. Bills of credit were emitted with no other fund for their redemption than taxation, and that deferred to di&s;tant periods. It was imagined that the ju&s;tice of our cau&s;e, and the united ardor and patrioti&s;m of the people, would pre&s;erve the value of the&s;e bills during the conte&s;t which we were very &s;anguine would be &s;hort; and in fact the circulation of them

Had this law regarded future contracts only, every man would have known on what terms to make his en|gagements; but to declare it legal to pay debts, already contracted, with money of an inferior value, was altogether unju&s;t. It was not in human power to prevent a depreciation of the bills; and the enforcing of their currency accelerated the de&s;truc|tion of their value. The fraudulent debtor took advantage of this law to cheat his creditor, under colour of ju&s;tice; whil&s;t the creditor had no other refuge, than in &s;ome ca&s;es privately to transfer the written obligation; and in other ca&s;es to refu&s;e the tender, at the ri&s;que indeed of lo&s;ing the debt; but in hope that ju&s;tice would at &s;ome future time have its cour&s;e. Hu&s;|bandmen, who lived remote from the &s;cene

of ho&s;tilities, and who had the produce of the earth at their command, were able to keep their property good. Hawkers and monopoli&s;ers, who crept from ob&s;curity and a&s;&s;umed the name of merchants, could even increa&s;e their &s;ub&s;tance in the&s;e peril|ous times. But tho&s;e per&s;ons who&s;e prop|erty was in other men's hands; or who&s;e living depended on &s;tated &s;alaries; or who&s;e hone&s;t minds could not de&s;cend to practi&s;e knavery, though e&s;tabli&s;hed by law, were doomed to &s;uffer.</P>
<P>To palliate the&s;e evils, at one time, a law was enacted again&s;t monopoly and extortion; and when found impracticable,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1777.</NOTE> it was repealed. At other times, the prices of different articles were &s;tated un|der &s;evere penalties; but ways were &s;oon found to evade the&s;e e&s;tabli&s;hments; and when found ineffectual, the laws were repealed. It is not con&s;i&s;tent with the nature of commerce to bear &s;uch re&s;tric|tions; and the laws increa&s;ed the evils which they pretended to cure. At another time public &s;ales by auction were prohibit|ed, becau&s;e it was &s;aid that they were the means of depreciating the currency; but in fact they &s;erved only to demon&s;trate its real value. There was a di&s;po&s;ition in the governing part of the people to keep

<P>This was a delicate point, and required the mo&s;t critical di&s;cu&s;&s;ion.

till the conclu&s;ion of a peace, there is no doubt that the State would have been a gainer both in reputation and intere&s;t; but when we were daily cheating and de|ceiving our&s;elves with a fraudulent paper medium, it is not &s;trange that the voice of ju&s;tice toward tho&s;e whom we deemed our enemies could not be heard.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t &s;tep toward executing this re|commendation of Congre&s;s,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1778.</NOTE> was an act pro&s;cribing certain per&s;ons, to the number of &s;eventy-&s;ix, who had at various times, and for various rea&s;ons, quitted this State. The&s;e were forbidden to return without leave, under the penalty of tran&s;portation; and in ca&s;e of a &s;econd return, they were to &s;uffer death.</P>
<P>The next &s;tep, was to confi&s;cate the whole e&s;tate, real and per&s;onal, of twenty-eight of the pro&s;cribed; of whom it was declared that they had
<Q>ju&s;tly forfeited all right to protection from the State; and al&s;o their right to any farther enjoyment of their intere&s;t and property within it.</Q></P>
<P>In the&s;e acts, no di&s;tinction was made between tho&s;e per&s;ons who had withdrawn them&s;elves from the State, by a &s;en&s;e of their duty; tho&s;e who were in fact Briti&s;h &s;ubjects, but occa&s;ionally re&s;ident here; tho&s;e who had ab&s;conded through timidity;
<PB N="431" REF="023166_0430_0FBC85477A270A08">
and tho&s;e who had committed crimes a|gain&s;t expre&s;s law, and had fled from ju&s;|tice. No conditional offer of pardon was made; no time was allowed for any to re|turn and enter into the &s;ervice of the coun|try; but the whole were put indi&s;crimi|nately into one <HI>black li&s;t,</HI> and &s;tigmati&s;ed as
<Q>having ba&s;ely de&s;erted the cau&s;e of lib|erty, and manife&s;ted a di&s;po&s;ition inimical to the State, and a de&s;ign to aid its ene|mies in their wicked purpo&s;es.</Q></P>
<P>Some per&s;ons who had legal demands on the&s;e e&s;tates, had for the &s;ecurity of their debts laid attachments on them; but by another act, all attachments which had been made &s;ince the commencement of ho&s;tilities, were declared null and void, and the Courts were required to di&s;mi&s;s them.</P>
<P>Tru&s;tees were appointed in each county to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all the&s;e e&s;tates, real and per&s;onal; and to &s;ell the per&s;onal im|mediately at public auction; with a di&s;|cretionary power to leave out of the &s;ale, &s;uch articles as they &s;hould deem nece&s;&s;ary, to the &s;upport of the families of the pro|&s;cribed. To pre&s;erve &s;ome farther appear|ance of ju&s;tice, the creditors of the&s;e e&s;tates, though they were not allowed to bid at the auctions without payment, were or|dered
<PB N="432" REF="023166_0431_0FBC854911207DB0">
to exhibit their claims to the tru&s;tees, and in ca&s;es of in&s;olvency, all claims were to be &s;ettled by the Judges of Probate.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t the &s;ettlement of the&s;e e&s;tates was going on, the money was rapidly de|preciating. After the year 1777, the State i&s;&s;ued no more bills, and the former were called in and exchanged for Trea&s;urer's notes on intere&s;t, of a value not le&s;s than five pounds. The Continental bills con|tinued pa&s;&s;ing and depreciating till the &s;pring of 1781, when &s;uddenly, and by general con&s;ent, they went out of circula|tion, and &s;olid coin &s;ucceeded in their place. Then a &s;cale of depreciation for the pre|ceding years of the war was framed, and all pa&s;t payments were regulated by it. The treaty of peace obliged us to proceed no farther in the matter of confi&s;cations. By a &s;ub&s;equent act, the Judges of Probate were empowered to liquidate by the &s;cale of depreciation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">March 1&punc; 1783.</NOTE> the &s;ums paid into the Trea&s;ury by the Tru&s;tees; to receive claims again&s;t the e&s;tates, and to adju&s;t and cer|tify the &s;ame to the Pre&s;ident, who was authori&s;ed to order the Trea&s;urer, to i&s;&s;ue notes, bearing intere&s;t from the time when the &s;aid &s;ums were paid into the Trea&s;ury; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">editors were to receive <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> if any of the e&s;tates

The clear profit to the State from all the&s;e confi&s;cations, as far as it has been a&s;cer|tained, is incon&s;iderable.</P>
<P>Power, when delegated without re&s;tric|tions, and for the abu&s;e of which the delegate is not held accountable, has a &s;trong tendency toward de&s;poti&s;m. The temporary con&s;titution which we had a|dopted at the beginning of the war, was found, by experience, to have many im|perfections; and the nece&s;&s;ity of checks and exclu&s;ions became every day more evi|dent. Other States were forming con&s;ti|tutions on certain e&s;tabli&s;hed principles, and defining their rights as a preliminary to the delegation of power. An attempt of the like kind was made in New-Hamp|&s;hire.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1779.</NOTE> A convention of delegates, cho&s;en for the purpo&s;e, drew up and &s;ent abroad a &s;y&s;tem of government; but &s;o deficient was it in its principles, and &s;o inadequate in its provi&s;ions, that being propo&s;ed to
<PB N="435" REF="023166_0434_0FBC854D8A1F1080">
the people, in their town-meetings, it was rejected. Another convention was ap|pointed, which had more advantage than the former, the neighbouring State of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts having dige&s;ted and adopted a con&s;titution, which was &s;uppo&s;ed to be an improvement on all which had been framed in America. This convention had no le&s;s than nine &s;e&s;&s;ions,<NOTE PLACE="marg">From June 1781, to Oct. 1783.</NOTE> and continued for more than two years. In the fir&s;t plan of government which they compo&s;ed, they di&s;tinctly &s;tated the alienable and unalien|able rights of the people. They divided the government into three branches, le|gi&s;lative, executive and judicial, and defin|ed the limits of each. The legi&s;lative branch was compo&s;ed of a Senate and Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives. The Senate was to con&s;i&s;t of twelve per&s;ons,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1781.</NOTE> five for the county of Rockingham, two for Straf|ford, two for Hill&s;borough, two for Che|&s;hire and one for Grafton. The&s;e were to be voted for in town-meetings, and the votes &s;ealed and returned to the Secretary's office. The number of Repre&s;entatives was limited to fifty, and apportioned a|mong the counties, thus; twenty for Rockingham; eight for Strafford; ten for Hill&s;borough; eight for Che&s;hire; and four for Grafton. The&s;e were to be elect|ed
<PB N="436" REF="023166_0435_0FBC854F51015CF0">
by County Conventions, con&s;i&s;ting of one delegate for every fifty rateable polls. This mode was recommended, to prevent tho&s;e intere&s;ted views and that party &s;pirit, which too often-appear in &s;ingle towns in the election of Repre&s;entatives. The ex|ecutive power was ve&s;ted in a Governor, whom the convention, in their addre&s;s to the people, de&s;cribed in the following terms:
<Q>They have arrayed him with honors, they have armed him with power and &s;et him on high; but &s;till he is only the right hand of your power, and the mirror of your maje&s;ty.</Q>
But though armed with power and liable to be im|peached for mi&s;conduct, he was &s;hrouded from re&s;pon&s;ibility, by a Council, without who&s;e advice he could not take one &s;tep of any importance. The judicial depart|ment was to be appointed by the executive and &s;upported by the legi&s;lative; but the Judges were removeable for mi&s;conduct, by the Governor and Council, on the addre&s;s of both Hou&s;es of the Legi&s;lature. Ju&s;tices of the Peace were to hold their commi&s;|&s;ions five years only. Provi&s;ion was made for the exclu&s;ion of per&s;ons from holding &s;everal offices at the &s;ame time; the rea&s;on of which was thus expre&s;&s;ed.
<Q>Be&s;ides the interference of &s;everal offices held by

the &s;ame per&s;on in point of time, which we have &s;een, and the difficulty of one man's giving his attention to many mat|ters &s;ufficiently to under&s;tand them all, which we have too often felt; there is a &s;till &s;tronger rea&s;on, which is the diffi|culty of a man's pre&s;erving his integrity in di&s;charging the duties of each.</Q>
The encouragement of literature was al&s;o re|commended as e&s;&s;ential to the pre&s;ervation of a free government, and it was declared to be the duty of legi&s;lators to cheri&s;h its intere&s;ts.</P>
<P>This plan was printed and &s;ent to every town.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sept. 14.</NOTE> The inhabitants were reque&s;ted to &s;tate their objections di&s;tinctly to any par|ticular part, and return them at a fixed time. The objections were &s;o many and &s;o various, that it became nece&s;&s;ary to alter the form and &s;end it out a &s;econd time.

<PB N="438" REF="023166_0437_0FBC8554A348CA88">
Particular attention was given to the mode of appointing officers of militia. In&s;tead of &s;uperior officers being cho&s;en by their inferiors, and inferior officers by the pri|vates, as had been practi&s;ed &s;ince the be|ginning of the war, the order of appoint|ment was rever&s;ed, and the privates had no power of choice at all. This was &s;aid to be nece<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ary to the pre&s;ervation of har|mony, &s;ubordination and di&s;cipline. The &s;econd plan being &s;ent out was generally approved; but it was not completed at the time when the news of peace arrived. The old form having expired with the war, it was,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1783.</NOTE> by the votes of the people in their town-meetings,<NOTE PLACE="marg">March and April.</NOTE> revived and continued for one year longer. In the following autumn, the new form was fini&s;hed;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Oct. 31.</NOTE> and the name of Governor being changed to Pre&s;ident, it was a third time printed and declared to be 'the civil con&s;titution for the State of New-Hamp&s;hire.' It took place on the &s;econd day of the following June,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1784.</NOTE> and was introduced at Concord by a religious &s;olemnity, which has &s;ince been repeated at every annual election.</P>
<P>To the convention which formed this con&s;titution &s;everal towns in the we&s;tern part of the State did not &s;end delegates. The cau&s;e of this omi&s;&s;ion, and of &s;ome
<PB N="439" REF="023166_0438_0FBC8555B84E5A38">
other eccentricities in the conduct of the people in that quarter mu&s;t now be ex|plained.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of the di&s;trict on the we&s;tern &s;ide of Connecticut river, which was &s;evered from New-Hamp&s;hire in 1764, had been engaged in a long and bitter controver&s;y with the government of New-York. They had even been oblig|ed to have recour&s;e to arms in defence of their e&s;tates; and frequent acts of violence had been committed. There was among them a &s;et of intrepid men, ready to en|counter dangers, and trained to hardy en|terpri&s;e. At the commencement of ho&s;til|ities, by the advice of &s;ome principal op|po&s;ers of the Briti&s;h Government, in the other Colonies, a company of tho&s;e people &s;tyling them&s;elves Green Mountain Boys, marched to Ticonderoga, and wre&s;ted that fortre&s;s, together with Crown-Point,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1775.</NOTE> out of the hands of the Briti&s;h garri&s;ons. A regiment of them was embodied by order and in the pay of the general Congre&s;s. Their exertions in the common cau&s;e were meritorious and their &s;ervices were accept|able.</P>
<P>Soon after the declaration of indepen|dence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1776.</NOTE> the inhabitants of that territory a&s;|sembled in convention to con&s;ider their
<PB N="440" REF="023166_0439_0FBC8557DD19EBB0">
peculiar &s;ituation and concert mea&s;ures for their &s;afety. The opportunity which then pre&s;ented for a change in their poli|tical connexions, was too precious to be lo&s;t. By the di&s;&s;olution of the bonds which had held America in &s;ubjection to the Crown of Britain, they conceived them&s;elves free from the government of New-York, to which the mo&s;t of them had never voluntarily &s;ubmitted; and, be|ing as they &s;aid, reduced to
<Q>a &s;tate of nature,</Q>
they thought that they had a right to form &s;uch connexions as were a|greeable to them&s;elves. Accordingly they made and publi&s;hed a declaration;
<Q>that they would at all times con&s;ider them|&s;elves as a free and independent State;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1777.</NOTE> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Jan. 15.</NOTE> capable of regulating their own internal police; that they had the &s;ole exclu&s;ive right of governing them&s;elves, in &s;uch manner as they &s;hould choo&s;e, not re|pugnant to the re&s;olves of Congre&s;s; and that they were ready to contribute their proportion to the common defence.</Q>
Under the influence of the&s;e principles, they formed a plan of government and a code of laws, and petitioned Congre&s;s to receive them into the union.</P>
<P>The inhabitants on the ea&s;tern &s;ide of Connecticut river were very conveniently
<PB N="441" REF="023166_0440_0FBC8558C56ED2C8">
&s;ituated to unite with tho&s;e on the we&s;tern &s;ide,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1778.</NOTE> and many of them had the &s;ame prin|ciples and views. They argued that the original grant of New-Hamp&s;hire to Ma|&s;on was circum&s;cribed by a line drawn at the di&s;tance of &s;ixty miles from the &s;ea; that all the lands we&s;tward of that line, being royal grants, had been held in &s;ub|jection to the government of New-Hamp|&s;hire by force of the royal commi&s;&s;ions, which were vacated by the a&s;&s;umed inde|pendence of the American Colonies; and therefore that the inhabitants of all tho&s;e lands had 'reverted to a &s;tate of nature.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ob&s;erva|tions on the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> ju|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">diction over N <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.

They a&s;&s;erted that juri&s;dictions e&s;tabli&s;hed by royal commi&s;|&s;ions could bind a people together no lon|ger than the force which fir&s;t compelled continues to operate; but when the coer|cive power of the King was rejected, and
<PB N="442" REF="023166_0441_0FBC855A47D6CA48">
its operation had cea&s;ed, the people had a right to make a &s;tand at the fir&s;t legal &s;tage, viz. their town incorporations. T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;e by univer&s;al con&s;ent were held &s;acred; hence they concluded that the major part of each one of tho&s;e towns had a right to control the minor part; and they con&s;ider|ed them&s;elves as &s;o many di&s;tinct corpora|tions, until they &s;hould agree to unite in one aggregate body.</P>
<P>In the&s;e &s;entiments the people were not all united. The majority of &s;ome towns was in favor of their former connexion, and in tho&s;e towns where the majority in|clined the other way, the minority claim|ed protection of the government.</P>
<P>They &s;uppo&s;ed that the exi&s;tence of their town-incorporations, and of the privileges annexed to them, depended on their union to New-Hamp&s;hire; and that their accept|ance of the grants was in effect an ac|knowledgment of the juri&s;diction, and a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the laws of the State; from which they could not fairly be di&s;engaged without its con&s;ent; as the State had never injured or oppre&s;&s;ed them.</P>
<P>Much pains, were taken, by the oth|er party, to di&s;&s;eminate the new ideas. Conventions were held, pamphlets were printed, and at length a petition was

<P>The Pre&s;ident of New-Hamp&s;hire, in the name of the A&s;&s;embly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. 22.</NOTE> wrote to the Governor of Vermont, claiming the &s;ixteen towns as part of the State, the limits of which had been determined prior to the revolution; reminding him that tho&s;e towns had &s;ent delegates to the convention in 1775; that they had applied to the A&s;|&s;embly for arms and ammunition, which had been &s;ent to them; that their military officers had accepted commi&s;&s;ions and obey|ed orders from the government; that the minority of tho&s;e towns was aver&s;e to a di&s;union, and had claimed protection of the State, which the A&s;&s;embly thought them&s;elves bound to afford; and be&s;eech|ing him to u&s;e his influence with the A&s;|&s;embly of Vermont to di&s;&s;olve the newly formed connexion.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time, the Pre&s;ident wrote to the delegates of the State in Congre&s;s;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. 19.</NOTE> de&s;iring them to take advice and endeavour to obtain the interpo&s;ition of that body;

intimating his apprehen&s;ion, that without it, the controver&s;y mu&s;t be decided by the &s;word, as every conde&s;cending mea&s;ure had been u&s;ed from the beginning and re|jected.</P>
<P>The Governor and Council of Vermont &s;ent a me&s;&s;enger to Congre&s;s to &s;ee in what light the new State was viewed by them. On his return he reported, that the Con|gre&s;s was unanimou&s;ly oppo&s;ed to the u|nion of the &s;ixteen towns with Vermont; otherwi&s;e they (excepting the delegates of New-York) had no objection to the inde|pendence of the new State.</P>
<P>At the next &s;e&s;&s;ion of the Vermont A&s;|&s;embly at Wind&s;or,<NOTE PLACE="marg">October.</NOTE> when the Repre&s;enta|tives of the &s;ixteen towns had taken their &s;eats, a debate aro&s;e on a que&s;tion, whether they &s;hould be erected into a new county, which pa&s;&s;ed in the negative. Conceiving that they were not admitted to equal pri|vileges with their brethren, the members from tho&s;e towns withdrew; and were fol|lowed by &s;everal others belonging to the towns adjoining the river on the we&s;t &s;ide. They formed them&s;elves into a convention, and invited all the towns on both &s;ides of the river to unite, and &s;et up another State by the name of New-Connecticut. This &s;ece&s;&s;ion had nearly proved fatal to the

State of Vermont. A ridge of mountains which extends from &s;outh to north through that territory, &s;eemed to form not only a natural, but a political line of divi&s;ion. A more cordial union &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between the people on the ea&s;tern &s;ide of the Green Mountains, and the ea&s;tern &s;ide of Connec|ticut river, than between the latter and tho&s;e on the we&s;tern &s;ide of the mountains; but the&s;e alone were in&s;ufficient, without the others, to make a State. The Gover|nor, and other leading men of Vermont, who re&s;ided on the we&s;t &s;ide of the Moun|tains, wrote letters to the A&s;&s;embly of New-Hamp&s;hire, informing them of the &s;eparation, and expre&s;&s;ing their di&s;appro|bation of a connexion with the &s;ixteen towns. The A&s;&s;embly regarded the&s;e let|ters as ambiguous, and as not expre&s;&s;ing a di&s;inclination to any <HI>future</HI> connexion with them. Jealou&s;y is &s;aid to be a re|publican virtue; it operated on this oc|ca&s;ion, and the event proved that it was not without foundation.</P>
<P>A convention of delegates from &s;everal towns on both &s;ides of the river a&s;&s;embled at Corni&s;h and agreed to unite,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dec 9.</NOTE> without any regard to the limits e&s;tabli&s;hed by the King in 1764; and to make the following propo&s;als to New-Hamp&s;hire, viz. either

to agree with them on a dividing line, or to &s;ubmit the di&s;pute to Congre&s;s, or to arbitrators mutually cho&s;en. If neither of the&s;e propo&s;als were accepted, then, in ca&s;e they could agree with New-Hamp|&s;hire on a form of government, they would con&s;ent that
<Q>the whole of the grants on both &s;ides of the river &s;hould connect them&s;elves with New-Hamp&s;hire, and become one entire State, as before the royal determination in 1764.</Q>

<P>An attempt was made in the following year to form a con&s;titution for New-Hamp&s;hire,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1779.</NOTE> in which the limits of the State were &s;aid to be the &s;ame as under the royal government,
<Q>re&s;erving never|thele&s;s our claim to the New-Hamp&s;hire Grants we&s;t of Connecticut river.</Q>
Tho' this form of government was rejected by a majority of the people; yet there was a di&s;po&s;ition in a great part of the A&s;&s;embly to retain their claim to the whole of the grants we&s;tward of the river. At the &s;ame time the State of New-York &s;et up a claim to the &s;ame lands, and it was &s;u&s;pected, perhaps not without rea&s;on, that intrigues were forming to divide Vermont between

The impri&s;oned She|riff applied to a Brigadier General of New-Hamp&s;hire, to rai&s;e the militia for his liberation.

<P>After this compliance, it was expected that Vermont would be admitted into the union, and the que&s;tion was &s;olemnly put in Congre&s;s;<NOTE PLACE="marg">April 14.</NOTE> but a majority decided a|gain&s;t it; to the no &s;mall di&s;appointment of many per&s;ons, be&s;ide the inhabitants of the di&s;puted territory.

<P>Though cut off from their connexion with Vermont, the revolted towns did not at once return to a &s;tate of peace; but the divi&s;ions and animo&s;ities which had &s;o long &s;ub&s;i&s;ted, continued to produce di&s;agreeable effects. The judicial Courts of New-Hamp&s;hire had &s;at without much interruption, in the counties of Che&s;hire and Grafton, whil&s;t the officers of Ver|mont

<P>When the Inferior Court was holden at Keene, a number of per&s;ons appeared,<NOTE PLACE="marg">September.</NOTE> to oppo&s;e its proceedings, and effected their purpo&s;e &s;o far as to make an adjourn|ment nece&s;&s;ary; but three of the leaders of the oppo&s;ition were arre&s;ted and bound over to the Superior Court. In the mean time efforts were made to rai&s;e a party who &s;hould oppo&s;e the Superior Court; and it was reported that two hundred men had a&s;&s;ociated and armed them&s;elves for that purpo&s;e. On the morning be|fore the Court was opened,<NOTE PLACE="marg">October.</NOTE> &s;everal of the leaders came to the Judges' chambers and pre&s;ented a petition, praying,
<Q>that the Court might be adjourned, and that no judicial proceedings might be had, whil&s;t the troubles in which the country had been involved &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;ted.</Q>
They were told that the Judges could come to no de|termination on the &s;ubject, but in open Court. When the Court was opened, their petition was publicly read; and the con&s;ideration of it was po&s;tponed to the next day. The Court then proceeded to

its common bu&s;ine&s;s. The Grand Jury being impannelled, the doors of the hou&s;e where they met were kept open, whil&s;t the Attorney General laid before them the ca&s;e of the rioters at the inferior Court.

From that time the &s;pirit of oppo&s;ition to gov|ernment in that quarter gradually abated; and the people returned to their connex|ion with New-Hamp&s;hire.</P>

<P>THE American revolution had been crowned with &s;ucce&s;s, as far as it re&s;pected our emancipation from foreign juri&s;diction, the e&s;tabli&s;hment of forms of government among our&s;elves, and our de|liverance from war. It remained, to ac|commodate the mind<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and manners of the people, under the new admini&s;tration, to a regular cour&s;e of ju&s;tice, both public and private; to perfect the union of the States; and to e&s;tabli&s;h a &s;y&s;tem of finance. The&s;e things were nece&s;&s;ary to make the revolution complete.</P>
<P>The extremes of de&s;poti&s;m on the one hand, and of licentiou&s;ne&s;s on the other, are equally to be avoided. In a ju&s;t me|dium between the&s;e, a government well balanced and executed with vigor, is capa|ble of producing the mo&s;t valuable bene|fits. To this point it was nece&s;&s;ary to conduct our revolution. But it was equal|ly
<PB N="460" REF="023166_0459_0FBC857E393923B0">
nece&s;&s;ary, that it &s;hould proceed by &s;low degrees; that errors in principle &s;hould be gradually reformed; and that men &s;hould be taught, by their own ex|perience, the folly of relying on any &s;y&s;|tem of politics, which, however &s;upported by popularity, is not founded in recti|tude.</P>
<P>A large debt, accumulated by the war, remained to be di&s;charged. For this pur|po&s;e, requi&s;itions were made by Congre&s;s, as well as by the State Government. Sil|ver and gold, which had circulated largely in the latter years of the war, were re|turning, by the u&s;ual cour&s;e of trade, to tho&s;e countries, whence large quantities of nece&s;&s;ary and unnece&s;&s;ary commodities had been imported. Had any general &s;y&s;tem of import been adopted, &s;ome part of this money might have been retained, and &s;ome part of the public debt di&s;charged; but the power of Congre&s;s did not extend to this object; and the States were not unit|ed in the expediency of delegating new and &s;ufficient powers to that body. The partial impo&s;ts, laid by &s;ome of the States, were ineffectual, as long as others found their intere&s;t in omitting them. Recour&s;e therefore was had to the u&s;ual mode of taxation on polls and e&s;tates; by which means, a heavy burden was laid on the
<PB N="461" REF="023166_0460_0FBC8580043BC168">
hu&s;bandman and the labourer. Tho&s;e who were punctual in their payments, &s;aw no probable end of their exertions, whil&s;t the negligence of others occa&s;ioned re|peated demands. Private creditors, who had &s;uffered by long forbearance, were importunate for their dues; and the Courts of Law were full of &s;uits.</P>
<P>The people who felt them&s;elves di&s;tre&s;&s;|ed, held conferences with a view to devi&s;e means of redre&s;s. The mo&s;t ea&s;y remedy which appeared to many of them, was a new emi&s;&s;ion of paper bills, funded on real e&s;tate, and loaned on intere&s;t. To effect this, petitions were addre&s;&s;ed to the Legi&s;lature; and to remedy the grievance,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1785.</NOTE> as far as it was occa&s;ioned by a debt of the State, an act was pa&s;&s;ed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Feb. 24.</NOTE> to draw into the Trea&s;ury all notes i&s;&s;ued by the State, and give certificates for the intere&s;t, and for fifteen per cent. of the principal, an|nually; which certificates were to be re|ceived by the Trea&s;urer for taxes,
<Q>in lieu of&punc; and equal to &s;ilver and gold.</Q>
By this means, it was expected that the debt would gradually be extingui&s;hed&punc; and that the people would ea&s;ily be enabled to pay at lea&s;t one &s;pecies of their taxes.</P>
<P>This was far from &s;atisfying the com|plainants. The public &s;ecurities, they
<PB N="462" REF="023166_0461_0FBC85834BEB4CD0">
&s;aid, were engro&s;&s;ed by rich &s;peculators, and the poor were di&s;tre&s;&s;ed for the means of paying their taxes and their private debts. The cry for paper money was ince&s;&s;ant; and the people were called up|on in the public papers,
<Q>to a&s;&s;ert their own maje&s;ty, as the origin of power, and to make their Governors know, that they are but the executors of the public will.</Q></P>
<P>To this clamor, the voice of rea&s;on and ju&s;tice calmly an&s;wered; that it was not in the power of the Legi&s;lature to e&s;tab|li&s;h any fund, which &s;hould &s;ecure paper money from depreciation; that there was &s;o much paper then in circulation, and the time of its redemption was &s;o di&s;tant, that the notes pa&s;&s;ed at a di&s;count of &s;ixty, and the certificates of twenty per cent; that if the quantity were increa&s;ed, the depreciation would increa&s;e in proportion; that if bills were i&s;&s;ued and made a tender in all payments, it would never be in the power of government to redeem them by &s;ilver and gold, becau&s;e none could be collected; and in that ca&s;e, no part of the continental or foreign debt could be di&s;charged; that if bills were loaned on land &s;ecurity, it would be in the power of the public debtor to purcha&s;e the bills at
<PB N="463" REF="023166_0462_0FBC8584B359B4C8">
a reduced value, and with them to make his payment at the Trea&s;ury, in which ca&s;e, though the public che&s;t might be filled with paper, yet the government would &s;uffer all the embarra&s;&s;ment of poverty. It was added, that the Legi&s;la|ture were by the Con&s;titution expre&s;sly forbidden to make retro&s;pective laws, and had no right to alter the nature of private contracts; and that &s;hould the majority of the people petition the government to make pap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> a lawful tender, it would be their duty to reject the petition as uncon|&s;titutional. When it was propo&s;ed, that the paper &s;hould not be a tender for pa&s;t but only for future contracts; it was an&s;wered, that this would not relieve the debtor, who was &s;uffering for his pa&s;t engagements, and the difficulties which it pretended to cure would &s;till exi&s;t.</P>
<P>In vain were agriculture and manufac|tures, indu&s;try and frugality recommend|ed as the only adequate &s;ources of re|lief; the complainants had no di&s;po&s;ition to apply a remedy &s;o &s;low in its operation; and indeed it was doubtful whether the utmo&s;t exertions in that way would have been &s;ufficient, completely to extricate us out of the&s;e difficulties, without &s;ome al|teration in our confederated government.</P>
<P><PB N="464" REF="023166_0463_0FBC8585B23C90B0">Similar difficulties, at the &s;ame time, exi&s;ted in the neighbouring State of Ma&s;|&s;achu&s;etts; to remedy which, among oth|er palliatives, a law was pa&s;&s;ed called a <HI>tender-act,</HI>
<Q>by which it was provided that executions i&s;&s;ued for private demands,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Minot's Hi&s;tory of the In&s;ur|rections, page 15.</NOTE> might be &s;atisfied by cattle and other enumerated articles, at an apprai&s;ement of impartial men under oath.</Q>
For &s;uch a law the di&s;contented party in New-Hamp&s;hire petitioned; and to gratify them the Legi&s;lature enacted, that
<Q>when any debtor &s;hall tender to his creditor,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 8.</NOTE> in &s;atisfaction of an execution for debt, either real or per&s;onal e&s;tate &s;uffi|cient, the body of the debtor &s;hall be exempt from impri&s;onment, and the debt &s;hall carry an intere&s;t of &s;ix per cent; the creditor being at lib|erty either to receive the e&s;tate, &s;o tendered, at a value e&s;timated by three apprai&s;ers, or to keep alive the demand by taking out an alias, within one year after the return of any former execution, and levying it on any e&s;tate of the debt|or which he can find.</Q>
At the &s;ame time an act was made, enlarging the power er of Ju&s;tices of the Peace, to try and de|termine actions of debt and tre&s;pa&s;s to the value of ten pounds. The&s;e laws
<PB N="465" REF="023166_0464_0FBC85872F562DE8">
were complained of as uncon&s;titutional; the former as being retro&s;pective, and changing the nature of contracts; the lat|ter as depriving the creditor, in certain ca&s;es, of a right to trial by Jury. But &s;o &s;trong was the clamor for redre&s;s of griev|ances; and &s;o influential was the exam|ple of the neighbouring State, that &s;ome of the be&s;t men in the Legi&s;lature found it nece&s;&s;ary to comply; whil&s;t another part were &s;ecretly in favor of wor&s;e mea|&s;ures.</P>
<P>The tender-act, at fir&s;t, was made for two years only; before the expiration of which it was revived, with &s;ome altera|tions, and continued for three years long|er. The effect of this law, in ca&s;es where an attempt was made to execute it, was, that the mo&s;t valuable kinds of property were either concealed or made over to a third per&s;on; and when the Sheriff came with an execution, it was levied on &s;uch articles as were of little u&s;e to the credi|tor. But the mo&s;t general effect of the law was to prevent any demand on the pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> of the creditor, and to encourage the debtor in neglecting payment.</P>
<P>The &s;carcity of money was &s;till a griev|ance which the laws had not remedied,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1786.</NOTE> but rather had a tendency to increa&s;e.

<P>The &s;ame party who were &s;o zealous in favor of paper currency, and again&s;t laws which obliged them to pay their debts, proceeded to inveigh again&s;t Courts and lawyers. The Inferior Courts were repre&s;ented as &s;inecures for Judges and Clerks; the defaulting, appealing, demur|ring, abatements, fees and bills of co&s;ts, without any deci&s;ion, were complained of
<PB N="468" REF="023166_0467_0FBC858DEF135888">
as burdens, and an abolition of the&s;e Courts became a part of the popular cry. But the party did not content them&s;elves with writing in the public papers. An attempt was made to call a convention, at Concord, whil&s;t the A&s;&s;embly was &s;it|ting there, who &s;hould petition the Le|gi&s;lature in favor of the plan; and it was thought, that the pre&s;ence of &s;uch a body of men, convened at the &s;ame time and place, would have great weight. This attempt was defeated in a manner &s;ingu|lar and humorous.</P>
<P>At the fir&s;t &s;itting of the A&s;&s;embly, when five only of the members of the propo&s;ed convention were in town,<NOTE PLACE="marg">June.</NOTE> &s;ome wags, among whom were &s;everal young lawyers, pretended to have been cho&s;en by the towns in which they lived for the &s;ame purpo&s;e. In conference with the five, they penetrated their views, and per|&s;uaded them to po&s;t an adverti&s;ement, for all the members who were in town to a&s;|&s;emble immediately; it being of the ut|mo&s;t importance to pre&s;ent their petition as early in the &s;e&s;&s;ion as po&s;&s;ible. By this means, &s;ixteen pretended members, with the five real ones, formed them&s;elves into a convention, choo&s;ing one of the five their Pre&s;ident, and one of the &s;ixteen
<PB N="469" REF="023166_0468_0FBC858F76B84D00">
their Clerk. They carried on their de|bates and pa&s;&s;ed votes with much apparent &s;olemnity. Having framed a petition, complaining in the mo&s;t extravagant terms of their grievances; praying for a loan of <HI>three millions</HI> of dollars, funded on real e&s;tate; for the abolition of Inferi|or Courts, and a reduction of the num|ber of lawyers, to two only in a county; and for a free trade with all the world; they went in proce&s;&s;ion to the A&s;&s;embly, (&s;ome of whom had been previou&s;ly let into the &s;ecret) and with great formality pre&s;ented their petition, which was &s;uf|fered to lie on the table, and was after|ward withdrawn. The convention then di&s;&s;olved; and when others, who had been really cho&s;en by the towns arrived, they were exceedingly mortified on finding their views for that time &s;o completely fru&s;|trated.</P>
<P>The next effort of the party was to call County Conventions. Of what cla&s;s of people the&s;e were compo&s;ed, &s;ome idea may be formed from this circum&s;tance. An innholder, at who&s;e hou&s;e one of the&s;e conventions fir&s;t met, refu&s;ed to take their promi&s;e for lumber to pay the expen&s;e of their meeting; upon which they adjourn|ed to a ware-hou&s;e, belonging to one of
<PB N="470" REF="023166_0469_0FBC8590F855D448">
the party, and were treated with liquor gratis.</P>
<P>From two of the&s;e conventions, and from &s;everal towns in different parts of the State, petitions were pre&s;ented to the Legi&s;lature,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sept. 13.</NOTE> at their &s;e&s;&s;ion in Exeter. On calm deliberation, the&s;e petitions appear|ed to be incon&s;i&s;tent with each other, with the con&s;titution, with ju&s;tice and public faith. But to &s;till the clamor and collect the real &s;en&s;e of the people on the &s;ubject of paper currency; the A&s;&s;embly formed a plan for the emi&s;&s;ion of fifty thou&s;and pounds, to be let at four per cent. on land &s;ecurity; to be a tender in payment of State taxes, and for the fees and &s;ala|ries of public officers. This plan was immediately printed, and &s;ent to the &s;ev|eral towns; and the people were de&s;ired to give their opinions in town-meetings for and again&s;t it, and to make return of their votes to the A&s;&s;embly at their next &s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>This <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of proceeding did not coin|cide with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> views of the party; the principal directors of which endeavoured to conceal them&s;elves, whil&s;t they per&s;uad|ed a con&s;iderable number of per&s;ons of various characters, to appear openly in &s;upport of the petitions. They took
<PB N="471" REF="023166_0470_0FBC85929CC40380">
pains to &s;pread fal&s;e reports through the country; and among other things, it was &s;aid that the A&s;&s;embly had pa&s;&s;ed an act, to refund the value of the confi&s;cated e&s;|tates, which was to be immediately a&s;&s;e&s;&s;|ed on the people.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, that at this time, cau&s;es of a &s;imilar nature had excited numbers of people in &s;ome counties of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, to a&s;&s;emble in arms and prevent the Judicial Courts from &s;itting. This example, aided by fal&s;e reports, and a &s;en&s;e of grievances, partly real and part|ly imaginary, operated &s;o powerfully on the minds of a number of people, in the we&s;tern part of the county of Rockingham; that on the morning of the twentieth of September,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sept. 20.</NOTE> about two hundred men a&s;|&s;embled at King&s;ton, &s;ix miles from Exe|ter, where they cho&s;e leaders and procured a drum. By the help of &s;ome militia offi|cers they formed them&s;elves into military order, and in the afternoon marched to Exeter; about one third of them being armed with mu&s;kets, and the others with &s;words and clubs. Having entered the confines of the town, they halted; and &s;ent a paper to the A&s;&s;embly, &s;igned by one of them who &s;tyled him&s;elf modera|tor, demanding an an&s;wer to their former
<PB N="472" REF="023166_0471_0FBC859575DF4E38">
petition immediately. They then march|ed through the town, and paraded before the meeting-hou&s;e, where both Hou&s;es of A&s;&s;embly were holding a conference. The doors were open, and as many of them as were di&s;po&s;ed, entered. The Pre&s;ident, in a cool and deliberate &s;peech, explained the rea&s;ons on which the A&s;&s;embly had proceeded in rejecting the petitions; ex|po&s;ed the weakne&s;s, incon&s;i&s;tency and in|ju&s;tice of their reque&s;t; and &s;aid, that if it were ever &s;o ju&s;t and proper in it&s;elf, and if the whole body of the people were in favor of it, yet the Legi&s;lature ought not to comply with it, whil&s;t &s;urrounded by an armed force. To do this, would be, to betray the rights of the people, which they had all &s;olemnly &s;worn to &s;up|port. He concluded by declaring, that no con&s;ideration of per&s;onal danger would ever compel them to violate the rights of their con&s;tituents.</P>
<P>This &s;peech being ended, the drum beat to arms; as many as had guns were or|dered to load them with balls; &s;entries were placed at the doors, and the whole Legi&s;lature were held pri&s;oners; the mob threatening death to any per&s;on who &s;hould attempt to e&s;cape, till their de|mands were granted. The A&s;&s;embly went
<PB N="473" REF="023166_0472_0FBC8597338A9C50">
on with their bu&s;ine&s;s, taking no farther notice of the rioters, till the approach of evening; when the Pre&s;ident attempted to go out, but was &s;topped by an impen|etrable column. He then rea&s;oned with them, and warned them of the fatal ten|dency of their conduct, a&s;&s;uring them, that the force of the country would &s;up|port the government. Their an&s;wers to him were in&s;olent and reproachful. They rai&s;ed a cry for paper-money, an equal di&s;tribution of property, and a relea&s;e from debts. The inhabitants of Exeter had all this time beheld with &s;ilence the in&s;ult offered to the Legi&s;lature; having no or|ders to take arms, they re&s;trained their indignation, till the du&s;k of the evening; when &s;ome of them beat a drum at a di&s;|tance, and others cried,
<Q>Huzza for gov|ernment! Bring up the artillery!</Q>
At the &s;ound of the&s;e words the mob were &s;truck with a panic, and began to di&s;per&s;e. Their moderator ordered them to meet again, at nine of the clock the next morn|ing, and they &s;cattered in every direction.</P>
<P>The A&s;&s;embly being thus at liberty, reque&s;ted the Pre&s;ident to call out the force of the State to quell the in&s;urrection. In the evening he i&s;&s;ued his orders, and before morning companies of militia, well
<PB N="474" REF="023166_0473_0FBC85988B1C6410">
armed, began to come in from the neigh|bouring towns. By ten of the clock in the morning a &s;ufficient body of hor&s;e and foot,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sept. 21.</NOTE> with field-pieces and military mu&s;ic, having arrived; the Pre&s;ident put them in motion again&s;t the in&s;urgents, who were then parading, about a mile di&s;|tant. Having by their &s;pies obtained in|telligence of the motion of the militia, the unarmed part of the in&s;urgents re|treated to a hill beyond the river; the others kept their ground till a party of light-hor&s;e appeared in view, and then the whole body retired. Some of them were taken by the pur&s;uers; others recov|ered the bridge at King's-fall, and being met by tho&s;e who had fir&s;t retreated, made an appearance as if they would di&s;pute the pa&s;&s;age. Orders were given by one of their leaders to fire; but the force of the government appeared &s;o formidable that they dared not to obey. The officers of the militia ru&s;hed in among them, &s;eiz|ed their moderator and others to the number of forty, the re&s;t fled with pre|cipitation, and no farther pur&s;uit was made. The pri&s;oners were di&s;armed and conducted to the town; where they were brought to an examination before the Pre&s;ident and Council. Had the&s;e men
<PB N="475" REF="023166_0474_0FBC8599F567B8F0">
been engaged in a good cau&s;e, and com|manded by proper officers, they would have maintained the honor of their country, and fought her battles with ar|dor and per&s;everance; but, con&s;cious that they were oppo&s;ing a government of their own e&s;tabli&s;hing, their native fortitude for&s;ook them; and being taken in arms, they gave an example of the mo&s;t humil|iating &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. Mo&s;t of them pro|fe&s;&s;ed to be a&s;hamed of their conduct, and their &s;hame appeared to be &s;incere.</P>
<P>The dignity of government being thus vindicated, its lenity was equally con&s;pic|uous. Six only of the pri&s;oners were detained, and a party of light-hor&s;e was &s;ent to apprehend two others of the mo&s;t culpable. They were taken out of their beds and brought to Exeter. This man|oeuvre had an excellent effect, for &s;ome, who knew them&s;elves equally guilty, were afraid to &s;leep in their own hou&s;es. The Superior Court being then in &s;e&s;&s;ion at Exeter,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sept. 25.</NOTE> the&s;e eight pri&s;oners were arraigned on an indictment for trea&s;on. One drop|ping on his knees, pleaded guilty; others he&s;itated when they pronounced the words 'not guilty.' They were ordered to re|cogni&s;e for their appearance at the next Superior Court, when their bonds were
<PB N="476" REF="023166_0475_0FBC859CFAE9B9E0">
di&s;charged. Some of them, who belong|ed to the Pre&s;byterian Churches, were cited before the eccle&s;ia&s;tical &s;e&s;&s;ion, and there cen&s;ured, as oppo&s;ers of ju&s;t gov|ernment. Others, being militia officers, were tried by a general Court Martial; of the&s;e, &s;ome were ca&s;hiered, but not in|capacitated for future &s;ervice; &s;ome were reprimanded, and others were acquitted. The whole oppo&s;ition was completely &s;ubdued; wavering minds became &s;ettled; converts were made to the &s;ide of govern|ment; and the &s;y&s;tem of knavery received a deep wound, from which it has not &s;ince recovered.</P>
<P>The plan which had been i&s;&s;ued by the A&s;&s;embly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1787.</NOTE> for emitting paper-money, was in cour&s;e referred to the people, in their town-meetings; and at the next &s;e&s;&s;ion the returns were made, when a ma|jority appeared again&s;t it.<NOTE PLACE="marg">J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n. 4.</NOTE> To fini&s;h the whole matter, two que&s;tions were put in the A&s;&s;embly. The fir&s;t was,
<Q>whether the Legi&s;lature can, con&s;i&s;tently with the con&s;titution, and their oaths, pa&s;s an act making paper bills of credit, a tender to di&s;charge private contracts, made prior to the pa&s;&s;ing &s;uch act?</Q>
The other was,
<Q>whether paper-money be emitted on any plan which has been propo&s;ed?</Q>
Both
<PB N="477" REF="023166_0476_0FBC859F526CBC60">
the&s;e que&s;tions were determined in the negative.</P>
<P>To ob&s;erve the progre&s;s of wi&s;dom and virtue, and the ob&s;tacles which are laid in the way of vice, is a mo&s;t plea&s;ing enter|tainment to the philanthropi&s;t; and it is but ju&s;t, in &s;uch a contemplation, to ac|knowledge that &s;uperintending influence, which brings good out of evil. It was feared by many, that the American revo|lution would not produce that &s;um of po|litical happine&s;s which its warme&s;t advo|cates had fondly predicted. The efforts of faction in &s;everal of the States were very alarming. In New-Hamp&s;hire, the a&s;&s;ault being made directly at the &s;upreme head of the government, the force of the State immediately ro&s;e and cru&s;hed it. In Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, the attacks were made on the Judicial Courts, which of them&s;elves had no power effectually to oppo&s;e them. The di&s;affection there ro&s;e to a higher de|gree; it was more exten&s;ively diffu&s;ed, and with more difficulty quelled. But at length the con&s;titutional powers of gov|ernment being exerted with vigor, the &s;pirit of anarchy was &s;uppre&s;&s;ed. In an|other neighbouring State, the &s;ame &s;pirit reigned triumphant. A depreciating cur|rency was e&s;tabli&s;hed by law, and perti|naciou&s;ly adhered to by the government.</P>
<P><PB N="478" REF="023166_0477_0FBC85A14271DEA8">The imbecility of the confederation by which the States were united, had long been felt, and &s;ome attempts had been making to &s;trengthen it; but the view of our &s;ituation at this time demon&s;trated the total inefficacy of that con&s;titution, to bind together thirteen di&s;tinct &s;ove|reignties, over which no coercive power was e&s;tabli&s;hed, which could prevent or cure &s;uch evils as threatened the de&s;truc|tion of all public and private credit. Hap|pily for the American union, the remedy exi&s;ted within it&s;elf. The good &s;ense and public virtue of the great body of our citizens readily adopted the idea of a CONVENTION OF THE STATES. The fir&s;t propo&s;al came from Virginia, where American liberty was fir&s;t publicly a&s;&s;ert|ed, when it was flagrantly violated by the &s;tamp-act. The name of <HI>Patrick Henry</HI> will ever be illu&s;trious in the A|merican annals for moving the re&s;olves of 1765; and the name of <HI>James Madi&s;on</HI> will be equally di&s;tingui&s;hed for propo&s;ing the Convention of 1787.</P>
<P>To this Convention, which was holden at Philadelphia, all the States, except <HI>one,</HI> &s;ent their delegates. After a clo&s;e and particular inve&s;tigation, they produced a new federal Con&s;titution; containing ad|equate
<PB N="479" REF="023166_0478_0FBC85A238F52188">
remedies for tho&s;e political di&s;or|ders, which had threatened with extinction, the liberty and independence of the Amer|ican States.</P>
<P>Among other wi&s;e provi&s;ions, to e&s;tab|li&s;h ju&s;tice and &s;ecure the ble&s;&s;ings of lib|erty, tho&s;e which re&s;pect public and pri|vate credit are not the lea&s;t con&s;picuous. To &s;upport the former, the Congre&s;s has a power which, by the fir&s;t confederation, was not delegated,
<Q>to lay and collect tax|es, duties, impo&s;ts, and exci&s;es, to pay the debts and provide for the common defence and general welfare of the Unit|ed States.</Q>
For the latter it is declared, that
<Q>no State &s;hall coin money, emit bills of credit, make any thing but gold and &s;ilver coin a tender in payment of debts, pa&s;s any bills of attainder or ex po&s;t facto law, or any law impairing the obligation of contracts.</Q></P>
<P>When this new Con&s;titution was pro|po&s;ed to the people, conventions were called in each State to con&s;ider it. In the&s;e bodies, compo&s;ed of per&s;ons who repre&s;ented impartially every cla&s;s and de&s;cription of the people, and who were them&s;elves equally various in their prin|ciples, habits and views; the Con&s;titution underwent the mo&s;t critical and &s;evere
<PB N="480" REF="023166_0479_0FBC85A3ADDEF350">
di&s;cu&s;&s;ion. Whil&s;t it was in debate, the anxiety of all parties was extended to the utmo&s;t degree, and the efforts of its friends and its oppo&s;ers were unremitted.</P>
<P>After the Con&s;titution had been, with the help of &s;ome propo&s;ed amendments,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1788.</NOTE> adopt|ed by Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Feb. 13.</NOTE> a convention was called at Exeter in New-Hamp&s;hire. At its fir&s;t meeting, a debate which continu|ed ten days ended in an adjournment for four months; at the expiration of which term, in a &s;hort &s;e&s;&s;ion of three days only at Concord,<NOTE PLACE="marg">June 21.</NOTE> the que&s;tion for adopting and ratifying the Con&s;titution, was, with the &s;ame help as in Ma&s;&s;achu|&s;etts, carried in the affirmative, by a ma|jority of eleven; the whole number pre&s;ent being one hundred and three. This was the <HI>ninth</HI> State in the union which ac|cepted the Con&s;titution; and thus the number was completed which was nece&s;|&s;ary to put in motion the political ma|chine. In about a month, two more States were added. Then a Congre&s;s was formed, and the illu&s;trious WASHINGTON,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1789.</NOTE> by the unanimous &s;uffrage of the people, was placed in the fir&s;t &s;eat of government. Three other States, of which one is Ver|mont, have &s;ince been admitted into the union; and there is now in operation a
<PB N="481" REF="023166_0480_0FBC85A6E44D9FF8">
general &s;y&s;tem of energetic government,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1790.</NOTE> which pervades every part of the United States, and has already produced a &s;ur|pri&s;ing alteration for the better. By the funding of the Continental debt, and the a&s;&s;umption of the debts of the individual States, into one general ma&s;s, a founda|tion is laid for the &s;upport of public cred|it; by which means the American revolu|tion appears to be completed. Let it be the &s;incere prayer and endeavour of every thoughtful citizen, that &s;uch harmony may prevail between the general govern|ment, and the juri&s;diction of each State, as the peculiar delicacy of their connexion requires; and that the ble&s;&s;ings of
<Q>peace, liberty and &s;afety,</Q>
&s;o dearly obtained, may de&s;cend inviolate to our po&s;terity.</P>

<HEAD>No. VI. Copy of a letter from his Excellency General <HI>WASHINGTON,</HI> to <HI>THOMAS CHITTENDEN,</HI> E&s;quire. [Certified by Tobias Lear, E&s;q. private Secretary to the Pre&s;ident of the United States.]</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Philadelphia,</HI> <DATE>1<HI>&s;t January,</HI> 1782.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I RECEIVED your favor of the 14th of November, by Mr. Brown&s;on. You cannot be at a lo&s;s to know why I have not heretofore, and why I cannot now, ad|dre&s;s you in your public character, or an&s;wer you in mine: But the confidence which you have been plea&s;ed to repo&s;e in me, gives me an opportunity of offering you my &s;entiments, as an individual, wi&s;hing mo&s;t ard|ently to &s;ee the peace and union of his country pre&s;erved, and the ju&s;t rights of the people of every part of it fully and firmly e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>
<P><PB N="491" REF="023166_0489_0FBC8724DCE31888">It is not my bu&s;ine&s;s, neither do I think it nece&s;&s;ary now, to di&s;cu&s;s the origin of the right of a number of inhabitants to that tract of country formerly di&s;tingui&s;h|ed by the name of the New-Hamp&s;hire Grants, and now known by that of Vermont. I will take it for granted that their right was good, becau&s;e Congre&s;s, by their re&s;olve of the 7th of Augu&s;t, imply it; and by that of the 21&s;t, are willing fully to confirm it, provided the new State is confined to certain de&s;cribed bounds. It appears, therefore, to me, that the di&s;pute of boundary is the only one that exi&s;ts, and that the being removed all further difficulties would be removed al&s;o, and the matter terminated to the &s;atisfaction of all parties. Now I would a&s;k you candidly, whether the claim of the people of Vermont, was not, for a long time, confined &s;olely, or very nearly, to that tract of country which is de&s;cribed in the re&s;olve of Congre&s;s of the 21&s;t of Au|gu&s;t la&s;t; and whether, agreeable to the tenor of your own letter to me, the late extention of your claim upon New-Hamp&s;hire and New-York, was not more a polit|ical manoeuvre, than one in which you conceived your|&s;elves ju&s;tifiable. If my fir&s;t que&s;tion be an&s;wered in the affirmative, it certainly bars your new claim. And if my &s;econd be well founded, your end is an&s;wered, and you have nothing to do but withdraw your juri&s;|diction to the confines of your old limits, and obtain an acknowledgment of independence and &s;overeignty, un|der the re&s;olve of the 21&s;t of Augu&s;t, for &s;o much ter|ritory as does not interfere with the ancient e&s;tabli&s;hed bounds of New-York, New-Hamp&s;hire and Ma&s;&s;achu|&s;etts. I per&s;uade my&s;elf you will &s;ee and acquie&s;ce in the rea&s;on, the ju&s;tice, and indeed the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;uch a deci&s;ion.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t con&s;ider, Sir, that the point now in di&s;pute is of the utmo&s;t political importance to the future union and peace of this great country. The State of Vermont, if acknowledged, will be the fir&s;t new one admitted into the confederacy; and if &s;uffered to encroach upon the ancient e&s;tabli&s;hed boundaries of the adjacent ones, will &s;erve as a precedent for others, which it may hereafter be expedient to &s;et off, to make the &s;ame unju&s;tifiable
<PB N="492" REF="023166_0490_0FBC8725EDBB7948">
demands. Thus, in my private opinion, while it be|hoves the Delegates of the States now confederated, to do ample ju&s;tice to a body of people &s;ufficiently re&s;|pectable by their numbers, and entitled by other claims to be admitted into that confederation, it becomes them al&s;o to attend to the intere&s;ts of their con&s;tituents, and &s;ee, that under the appearance of ju&s;tice to one, they do not materially injure the rights of others. I am apt to think this is the prevailing opinion of Congre&s;s, and that your late exten&s;ion of claim has, upon the princi|ple I have above mentioned, rather dimini&s;hed than in|crea&s;ed your friends; and that, if &s;uch exten&s;ion &s;hould be per&s;i&s;ted in, it will be made a common cau&s;e, and not con&s;idered as only affecting the rights of tho&s;e States immediately intere&s;ted in the lo&s;s of territory; a lo&s;s of too &s;erious a nature not to claim the attention of any people. There is no calamity within the compa&s;s of my fore&s;ight, which is more to be dreaded than a nece&s;|&s;ity of <HI>coertion</HI> on the part of Congre&s;s; and con&s;equent|ly every endeavour &s;hould be u&s;ed to prevent the execu|tion of &s;o di&s;agreeable a mea&s;ure. It mu&s;t involve the ruin of that State again&s;t which the re&s;entment of the others is pointed.</P>
<P>I will only add a few words upon the &s;ubject of the negociations, which have been carried on between you and the enemy in Canada and in New-York. I will take it for granted, as you a&s;&s;ert it, that they were &s;o far innocent, that there never was any &s;erious intention of joining Great-Britain in their attempts to &s;ubjugate your country; but it has had this certain bad tendency, it has &s;erved to give &s;ome ground to that delu&s;ive opinion of the enemy, and upon which they, in a great mea&s;ure, found their hopes of &s;ucce&s;s; that they have numerous friends among us, who only want a proper opportunity to &s;hew them&s;elves openly; and that internal di&s;putes and feuds will &s;oon break us in pieces. At the &s;ame time the &s;eeds of di&s;trust and jealou&s;y are &s;cattered among our&s;elves by a conduct of this kind. If you are &s;erious in your profe&s;&s;ions, the&s;e will be additional mo|tives for accepting the terms which have been offered, (and which appear to me equitable) and thereby con|vincing
<PB N="493" REF="023166_0491_0FBC8727A0DFA640">
the common enemy, that all their expectations of di&s;union are vain, and that they have been wor&s;ted at their own weapon&mdash;deception.</P>
<P>As you unbo&s;om your&s;elf to me, I thought I had the greater right of &s;peaking my &s;entiments openly and can|didly to you. I have done &s;o, and if they &s;hould pro|duce the effect which I mo&s;t &s;incerely wi&s;h, that of an honorable and amicable adju&s;tment of a matter, which, if carried to ho&s;tile lengths, may de&s;troy the future hap|pine&s;s of my country, I &s;hall have attained my end, while the enemy will be defeated of theirs.</P>
<P>Believe me to be, with great re&s;pect,</P>
<CLOSER><SALUTE>Sir,</SALUTE>
<SIGNED>Your mo&s;t obedient &s;ervant, GEORGE WASHINGTON.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
