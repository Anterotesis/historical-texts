upon. The way for us, to have our <HI>Hou|&s;es</HI> taken away from us, is, to have our <HI>Hearts</HI> vainly fond of continuing in them. It was therefore an Annual, and a mo&s;t &s;uitable <HI>Ceremony,</HI> which the Lord Enjoin|ed upon His People of old; When a Good <HI>Harvest</HI> had fill'd their <HI>Hou&s;es,</HI> God ordered them to go out of their <HI>Hou&s;es</HI>; they mu&s;t then go make Little <HI>Tabernacles</HI> abroad, and keep the Fea&s;t of <HI>Tabernacles.</HI> Thus did the Lord mind them of their Condition in this World; when they had never &s;o much of <HI>this World</HI> about them, they mu&s;t not forget that they were no more than <HI>Sojourners</HI> in the World. This I &s;ay; Tho' we have <HI>Hou&s;es</HI> that we can <HI>Fea&s;t</HI> in, yet Let us have the Temper of a <HI>Fea&s;t of Taberna|cles</HI> in us.
