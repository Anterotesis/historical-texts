<P>Looking Stedfa&s;tly on him, they &s;aw his Face, as it had been the Face of an ANGEL.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>SInce the <HI>Oracles</HI> of Heaven, have (with a mo&s;t &s;ignificant Admonition!) allow'd a well &s;erved Church, to call its <HI>Pa&s;tor,</HI> by the Name of its <HI>Angel,</HI> we may now &s;ay, <HI>The Angel of the Church of</HI> Port&s;mouth, <HI>has newly taken wing!</HI> Yea, not the Lea&s;t of the <HI>Angelical Chariots and Hor&s;emen of</HI> New England, have de|parted from us, in the <HI>Withdraw</HI> of One, after whom that Bereaved Church, is crying, <HI>My Fa|ther, My Father!</HI></P>
<P>To prae&s;erve the <HI>Idea,</HI> and <HI>Memory,</HI> of his <HI>Face,</HI> as far as the Infirmities of this <HI>Mortal State</HI> per|mitted any Approaches to the <HI>Angelical</HI> Chara|cter in it, is that whereto not only <HI>Nature</HI> does Invite us, but al&s;o <HI>Scripture</HI> does oblige us: 'Twill be but a compliance with that Edict of Heaven, <HI>Remember them who have &s;poken to you, the Word of God; who&s;e Faith follow, con&s;idering the End of their Conver&s;ation.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="000797_0005_0FAA525FADA63BC8">'Tis well known, That among the chief Works of the Mo&s;t High, Created by the Son of God, at the Fir&s;t Beginning of Time, there were His <HI>Good</HI> ANGELS: <HI>Angels,</HI> which are Spiritual and Rational Sub&s;tances, Created by the Lord, for His own Immediate Service and Honour. None Deny, None Di&s;pute, the Exi&s;tence of tho&s;e <HI>Good Angels,</HI> but men that are under a more than ordinary Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of <HI>Evil</HI> Ones.</P>
<P>Our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, has given it, as a De|&s;cription of that <HI>Future State,</HI> wherein He will make us Happy for ever, Math. 22.30. <HI>They are as the Angels of God in Heaven.</HI> And if we Hope, to be <HI>Happy</HI> in that <HI>Future State,</HI> we mu&s;t endeavour to Anticipate it, by being very <HI>Holy</HI> in our <HI>Pre&s;ent State.</HI> But the way for us, to be very <HI>Holy,</HI> is to Re&s;emble, and Imitate, the <HI>An|gels of God in Heaven,</HI> while we are on Earth, as far as we are able. Every <HI>Holy man</HI> does a <HI>Little</HI> of This; and <HI>how much</HI> of it, was done by that <HI>Holy man,</HI> who is now gone to Live, and Prai&s;e, and &s;ee CHRIST, among the <HI>Angels</HI> for ever, may be propo&s;ed with &s;ome Advantage unto the <HI>Exhortation,</HI> wherein I have a <HI>few Things to Preach unto the People.</HI></P>
<P>But my <HI>Exhortation</HI> mu&s;t be introduced, with a Report of that <HI>Glory,</HI> which the Martyr <HI>Ste|phen,</HI> while he was yet on Earth, attain'd unto.</P>
<P>There being occa&s;ion to choo&s;e <HI>Deacons</HI> in the Primitive Church, that &s;o they who were to give them&s;elves continually unto the <HI>Ministry of
<PB N="7" REF="000797_0006_0FAA52601B126F68">
the Word,</HI> might be Relea&s;ed, by the faithful Cares of tho&s;e <HI>Deacons,</HI> from Secular Encumbran|ces; <HI>One</HI> of them was the Ble&s;&s;ed <HI>Stephen</HI>; who being the Fir&s;t that arriv'd unto the <HI>Crown of Martyrdome</HI> for our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, in the New-Te&s;tament, had in the Name of <HI>Stephen,</HI> which &s;ignifies, <HI>A Crown,</HI> a notable Specification, of the <HI>Event</HI> and <HI>Reward,</HI> which will attend all our <HI>Sufferings</HI> for the Lord.</P>
<P>It was then an Age of many <HI>Miracles</HI> wrought by the <HI>Spirit</HI> of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t; and &s;uch a <HI>mea&s;ure</HI> of that <HI>Spirit,</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed this Excellent man, that by the <HI>Impul&s;e</HI> of that <HI>Spirit,</HI> He could, with all A&s;&s;urance, perceive when the <HI>Spirit</HI> was going to work <HI>Miracles,</HI> and apply him&s;elf to ac|company the <HI>Miracles</HI> of the <HI>Spirit,</HI> by &s;ome wonderful <HI>Actions</HI> of his own. This Illu&s;trious Worker of <HI>Miracles,</HI> was Accu&s;ed before the <HI>Council</HI> at <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> for &s;aying, That it was the De&s;ign of <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> to de&s;troy the <HI>Temple,</HI> and the <HI>City,</HI> and alter the <HI>Rites,</HI> which <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> had, from God, commanded unto <HI>I&s;rael.</HI> When he appear'd before the <HI>Council</HI> to an&s;wer this Accu&s;ation, 'tis here &s;aid, <HI>They &s;aw his Face, as it had been the Face of an Angel.</HI></P>
<P>Concerning the <HI>Face of an Angel,</HI> we have a Remarkable Account, in what we read about one of the <HI>Angels,</HI> in Mat. 28.3. His <HI>Countenance was like Lightning.</HI> And we read concerning a Great man, who had got the <HI>Face of an Angel,</HI> by being much with the <HI>Angels,</HI> in Exod 34.10. <HI>Behold,
<PB N="8" REF="000797_0007_0FAA5260E9DBF140">
the skin of his Face &s;hone.</HI> If we carry the pa&s;&s;age now before us, unto the Highe&s;t &s;en&s;e, which it would lay claim unto, we are to &s;uppo&s;e, That &s;uch a <HI>Splendor</HI> was di&s;cernible upon the <HI>Face</HI> of <HI>Stephen</HI>: And &s;urely, if they who di&s;cerned it, had not had the <HI>Heart of a Devil</HI> in them, they dur&s;t not have gone on, to Abu&s;e a <HI>man,</HI> that Appeared before them, with the <HI>Face of an Angel.</HI> Alas, the more of an <HI>Angel</HI> there is in any <HI>man,</HI> the more <HI>Stones</HI> will the <HI>Devil</HI> procure to be thrown at &s;uch a <HI>Man!</HI> But, behold, the <HI>Agreeablene&s;s</HI> of the matter; <HI>Stephen</HI> was per&s;ecuted for vilifying of <HI>Mo&s;es</HI>; and, behold, at this very Time, he is vindicated with a <HI>Shine</HI> upon his <HI>Face,</HI> like that once upon the <HI>Face</HI> of <HI>Mo&s;es.</HI> The Things here &s;poken by <HI>Stephen,</HI> were tho&s;e very Things, which the <HI>Angel Gabriel,</HI> had formerly &s;poken unto the <HI>Prophet Daniel</HI>; and behold, the A&s;pect of an <HI>Angel</HI> adorns him, in his Di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>We may from hence, take Leave to Ob&s;erve,
That a <HI>Saint on Earth,</HI> may arrive to tho&s;e Attain|ments, that &s;hall make him Look like an <HI>Angel of Heaven.</HI></P>
<P>There are <HI>Angelical Excellencies,</HI> a Degree whereof, poor <HI>man,</HI> &s;orry <HI>man,</HI> &s;inful <HI>man,</HI> even while &s;uch, may very much attain unto.</P>
<P>But now, this CASE calls for our Attention;
What are tho&s;e Excellencies, that would make a Saint, Look like an <HI>ANGEL</HI>?</P>
<P>And the General An&s;wer hereunto is, The <HI>Excellencies of Holine&s;s</HI>&punc; For,</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="000797_0008_0FAA5261689052B8">Fir&s;t, The <HI>Angels</HI> of God, have many <HI>Excel|lencies,</HI> the Imitation whereof cannot by men in this Life, be Rea&s;onably propo&s;ed. The <HI>Angeli|cal Maje&s;ty,</HI> as a <HI>Mortal Eye</HI> would not be able &s;teadily to <HI>Behold</HI> it, much le&s;s, in this <HI>Mortal State,</HI> may we <HI>Affect</HI> it. A man may not wi&s;h to <HI>Shine</HI> like <HI>Stephen,</HI> in this World, and have a <HI>Face,</HI> that may dazzle the Spectators. Or, what would it avail, if a man could make a Glare on his <HI>Face,</HI> by &s;mearing it with &s;ome of the <HI>Noctilu|ca's</HI> invented by the <HI>Modern Chymi&s;try</HI>? A <HI>Devil</HI> has before now, pretended unto &s;uch a <HI>Face.</HI> 'Tis not the <HI>Face,</HI> but the <HI>Grace,</HI> of an <HI>Angel,</HI> which is here to be A&s;pired after. It were a Fooli&s;h, and a Faulty Thing, for any man, to be ambitious, of wearing in this World, &s;uch a Figure, as that in Dan. 10.6. <HI>His Body like the Beryl, and his Face as the Appearance of Lightning, and his Eyes as Lamps of Fire. Immortality</HI> it &s;elf, is one of the <HI>Angelical Excellencies.</HI> But, while we are among <HI>Mortals</HI> here, we mu&s;t &s;ubmit unto the Laws of <HI>Mortality,</HI> and be willing to <HI>Dy,</HI> When, and How, the So|veraign God &s;hall order it. There are al&s;o, tho&s;e Flights of <HI>Wi&s;dom,</HI> and tho&s;e Heights of <HI>Power</HI> among the <HI>Angelical Excellencies</HI>; wherein, 'tis not for us, to Dream of being <HI>Like</HI> them, until we are become, <HI>The Children of the Re&s;urrection</HI> It was the Ruine of our <HI>Fir&s;t Parents,</HI> to imagine, in Gen. 3.5. They <HI>might be as Elohim!</HI> No, this cannot be, until our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, has by a <HI>New Birth</HI> brought us into that <HI>World to come,</HI>
<PB N="10" REF="000797_0009_0FAA52626BDED5C0">
where, the <HI>Wi&s;e Converters of many to Righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> will be tho&s;e, who &s;hall <HI>Shine as the Brightne&s;s of the Firmament, and as the Stars for ever and ever!</HI> Our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, will make <HI>us</HI> the <HI>Angels</HI> of the <HI>New World.</HI> Indeed the <HI>Angels</HI> now turn and move all the <HI>Wheels</HI> of the <HI>Kingdoms</HI> of <HI>this World,</HI> but <HI>we</HI> are they that &s;hall <HI>Receive the Kingdom that cannot be moved.</HI></P>
<P>But, Secondly, The <HI>Excellencies of Holine&s;s,</HI> [For, the <HI>Saints,</HI> are the <HI>Excellent!</HI>] The&s;e are They, wherein the Imitation of the <HI>Angels</HI> by <HI>men,</HI> may be very far proceeded in. The <HI>Angels</HI> of God, are &s;tyled, in Mat. 25.31. <HI>The Holy Angels</HI>; and in Dan. 4.17. <HI>The Holy Ones.</HI> 'Tis not as they are <HI>Mighty Angels,</HI> but as they are <HI>Holy Angels,</HI> that we mu&s;t propound our coming to Look like unto them. The&s;e <HI>Holy Angels,</HI> never did, and never will Sin again&s;t their God; but are conti|nually Serving of Him; <HI>They Serve Him Day and Night in His Temple!</HI> And it may be, the <HI>Bright Garments,</HI> wherein the&s;e <HI>Angels of Light,</HI> have ap|peared, may be an Emblem of their <HI>Holine&s;s</HI> and their <HI>Purity.</HI> Now it hath been the <HI>Will of God in our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t concerning us,</HI> that there &s;hould be &s;et before us, the Greate&s;t Exemples of <HI>Holine&s;s</HI> for our Imitation. And hence, as we have the Greater <HI>Exemple</HI> of our Lord JESUS CHRIST Him&s;elf given unto us, to Direct and Excite and Promote our <HI>Holine&s;s,</HI> with a Charge, <HI>To be Holy, as He that hath called us is Holy</HI>; So, we have al&s;o the <HI>Exemple</HI> of the <HI>Holy Angels</HI> given unto us, That
<PB N="11" REF="000797_0010_0FAA526327703CB8">
we may &s;trive as far as may be, to be Like unto them in their <HI>Holine&s;s.</HI> Hence when the P&s;ami&s;t of old &s;aw the <HI>Angels</HI> prai&s;ing of God, he cryed out, <HI>O my Soul, do Thou &s;o too</HI>! Yea, &s;ome Inter|preters Judge, That when the <HI>Face</HI> of <HI>Stephen</HI> Look'd like an <HI>Angel,</HI> it was no more than what you and I may <HI>thro' Chri&s;t who &s;trengthens us,</HI> reach unto. <HI>q d.</HI> The <HI>Con&s;olations</HI> of the <HI>Holy Spirit</HI> of God, &s;o filled him, that he di&s;covered not the lea&s;t <HI>Con&s;ternations</HI> in his <HI>Face</HI>: His <HI>Face</HI> was as Joyful, and Serene, as if he had &s;tood free from all the <HI>Sorrows</HI> of this World, among the <HI>Angels</HI> of God.</P>
<P>I remember the Apo&s;tle Enjoins the <HI>Woman</HI> in the Church to have a covering on her Head, in Token of Subjection to her <HI>Husband; Becau&s;e of the Angels.</HI> [2 Cor. 11.10.] Why, if you turn to the Beginning of the &s;ixth Chapter of <HI>I&s;aiah,</HI> you'l find the <HI>Angels</HI> before their Superiour, the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, in the <HI>Temple</HI> a&s;&s;uming a <HI>Cover|ing,</HI> out of the Reverence which they pay unto Him. Hence then, &s;ays the Apo&s;tle, it becomes <HI>Women</HI> to take <HI>Example</HI> by the <HI>Angels</HI>; let them con&s;ider, how the <HI>Angels</HI> behave them&s;elves in the Pre&s;ence of the <HI>Son</HI> of God, who is the Grand Repre&s;entative of the <HI>Image</HI> and <HI>Glory</HI> of God; and let them in their <HI>Habit</HI> &s;how &s;ome Analogy to the <HI>Habit</HI> of the <HI>Angels</HI>: betokening their Sub|jection to the <HI>man,</HI> who is under the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the <HI>Image</HI> and <HI>Glory</HI> of God, while <HI>They</HI> the <HI>Women,</HI> are &s;o of the <HI>man.</HI> But I only touch
<PB N="12" REF="000797_0011_0FAA5263B21040F0">
on this glo&s;s, by the by. What I in&s;i&s;t on, is, That the <HI>Angelical Example</HI> is to be imitated.</P>
<P>Indeed, we &s;hall, as long as we Live in this World, come far &s;hort of the <HI>Original,</HI> when we go to Write after the <HI>Angelical Example.</HI> In this <HI>Pre&s;ent Evil World,</HI> we cannot approach near to the <HI>Holine&s;s</HI> of the <HI>Good Angels</HI>: Much of Sin, and Fault, &amp; Folly, will unavoidably cleave unto us: That <HI>Lepro&s;y</HI> will never wholly out of the <HI>Walls,</HI> until the <HI>Clay-hou&s;e</HI> be utterly demoli&s;hed: There will be as much Di&s;tance between the <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed Spi|rits</HI> and <HI>Us,</HI> as between <HI>Giants</HI> and <HI>Children,</HI> as be|tween <HI>Stars</HI> and <HI>Gloworms,</HI> as between the <HI>Cedars</HI> of <HI>Lebanon,</HI> and the <HI>Hy&s;op</HI> that <HI>Grows out of the Wall</HI>; Thus it will be, until we come at length to dwell [And, <HI>Oh! Why do we no more Long for it!</HI>] with the <HI>Innumerable Company of Angels,</HI> in another World.</P>
<P>However, to Attempt the Imitation, is the rea|dy way to be <HI>Excellent.</HI> Particularly in the En|&s;uing In&s;tances.</P>
<P N="1"><HI>I.</HI> If a man could have his <HI>Eye</HI> upon the <HI>Face of God</HI> continually, would not that procure the <HI>Face of an Angel</HI> for him? It would make a man Look like an <HI>Angel,</HI> if he were Looking unto God, in the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t continually. Of the <HI>Angels</HI> there is that Account given, in Mat. 18.10. <HI>In the Heavens, they do always behold the Face of my Father which is in the Heavens.</HI> The <HI>Angels</HI> do conver&s;e with GOD continually.

<P>Fir&s;t, We may have a continual <HI>Apprehen&s;ion</HI> of GOD in our minds.
