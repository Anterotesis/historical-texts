<HEAD>DECLARATION. Of the Nobility, Gentry, and Commonalty at the Rendezvous at <HI>Nottingham,</HI>
<DATE><HI>November</HI> 22. 1688.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>WE the Nobility, Gentry, and Commonalty of these Northern Coun|ties assembled together at <HI>Nottingham,</HI> for the defence of the Laws, Religion and Properties, according to those free born Liberties and Priviledges, descended to us from our Ancestors, as the undoubted Birth-right of the Subjects of this Kingdom of <HI>England,</HI> (not doubt|ing but the Infringers and Invaders of our Rights will represent us to the rest of the Nati|on in the most malicious dress they can put upon us) do here unanimously think it our Duty to declare to the rest of our Protestant Fellow-Subjects the Grounds of our present Undertaking</P>
<P>We are by innumerable Grievances made sensible, that the very Fundamentals of our Religion, Liberties and Properties are about to be rooted out by our late Jesuitical Privy Council, as hath been of late too apparent, 1: by the King's dispensing with all the Esta|blisht Laws at his pleasure. 2. By displacing all Officers out of all Offices of Trust and Advantage, and placing others in their room that are known Papists, deservedly made in|capable by the Establisht Laws of our Land. 3. By destroying the Charters of most Cor|porations in the Land. 4. By discouraging all persons that are not Papists, Preferring such as turn to Popery. 5. By displacing all honest and conscientious Judges, unless they would contrary to their Consciences, declare that to be Law which was meerly arbitrary. 6. By branding all men with the name of Rebels that but offered to justifie the Laws in a legal Course against the arbitrary proceedings of the King, or any of his corrupt Ministers. 7. By burthening the Nation with an Army, to maintain the violation of the Rights of the Subiects. 8. By discountenancing the Establisht Reform'd Religion. 9. By forbidding the Subjects the benefit of Petitioning, and construing them Libellers; so rendring the Laws a Nose of Wax, to serve their arbitrary Ends. And many more such like, too long here to enumerate.</P>
<P>We being made thus sensible of the Arbitrary; and Tyrannical Government that is by the Influence of Jesuitical Councels coming upon us, do unanimously declare, That not be|ing willing to deliver our Posterity over to such a condition of Popery and Slavery, as the aforesaid Oppressions inevitably threaten; we will to the utmost of our power, oppose the same, by joining with the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> (whom we hope God Almighty hath sent to rescue us from the Oppressions aforesaid) will use our utmost endeavour for the recovery of our almost ruin'd Laws, Liberties, and Religion; and herein we hope all good Prote|stant Subjects will with their Lives and Fortunes be assistant to us, and not be bugbear'd with the opprobrious terms of Rebels, by which they would fright us, to become perfect Slaves to their tyrannical Insolencies and Usurpations; for we assure our selves, that no rational and unbyassed person will judge it Rebellion to defend our Laws and Religion, which all our Princes have Sworn at their Coronations; which Oath, how well it hath been observed of late, we desire a free Parliament may have the Consideration of.</P>
<P>We own it Rebellion to resist a King that governs by Law; but he was always accoun|ted a Tyrant that made his Will the Law; and to resist such an one, we justly esteem no Rebellion, but a necessary Defence; and in this Consideration we doubt not of all honest mens assistance, and humbly hope for, and implore the great God's protection, that tur|neth the hearts of his people as pleaseth him best, it having been observed, That people can never be of one mind without his inspiration, which hath in all Ages confirmed that observation, <HI>Vox Populi est Vox Dei.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The present restoring of Charters, and reversing the oppressing and unjust Judgment given on</HI> Magdalen <HI>Colledge Fellows is plain, are but to still the people, like plums to Children, by deceiv|ing them for a while; but if they shall by this Stratagem be fooled, till this present storm that threatens the Papists be past, as soon as they shall be resetled, the former Oppression will be put on with greater vigour, but we hope in vain is the Net spread in the sight of the Birds: For</HI> 1. <HI>The Pa|pists old Rule is,</HI> That Faith is not to be kept with Hereticks, <HI>as they term Protestants, though Popish Religion is the greatest Heresie. And</HI> (2) <HI>Queen</HI> Maries <HI>so ill observing her promises to the</HI> Suffolk <HI>men that helpt her to her Throne. And above all</HI> (3) <HI>the Popes dispensing with the breach of Oaths, Treaties, or Promises, at his pleasure when it makes for the Service of Holy Church, as they term it. These we say are such convincing Reasons to hinder us from giving Cre|dit to the aforesaid Mock-Shews of Redress, that we think our selves bound in Conscience to rest on no Security that shall not be approved by a freely Elected Parliament, to whom under God we refer our Cause.</HI></P>

<HEAD>The <HI>DECLARATION</HI> of the LORDS Spiritual and Temporal, In and about the Cities of <HI>London</HI> and <HI>Westminster,</HI> Assembled at <HI>Guildhall,</HI>
<DATE>11th. <HI>Decemb.</HI> 1688.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>WEE doubt not but the World believes that, in this Great and Dangerous Con|juncture, We are heartily and zealously concerned for the Protestant Religion, the Laws of the Land, and the Liberties and Properties of the Subject. And We did reasonably hope, that the King having issued his Proclamation, and Writs for a free Parliament, We might have rested secure under the Expectation of that Meeting: But His Majesty having withdrawn himself, and as we apprehend, in order to His Departure out of this Kingdome, by the Pernicious Councels of Persons ill affected to Our Nation and Religion; We cannot, without being Wanting to Our Duty, be si|lent under those Calamities, wherein the Popish Counsels which so long prevailed, have miserably involved these Realms. We do therefore Unanimously resolve to apply Our Selves to his Highness the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> who with so great kindness to these King|doms, so vast Expence, and so much hazard to his own Person, hath undertaken, by en|deavouring to procure a free Parliament, to rescue Us, with as little Effusion, as possible, of Christian Blood from the imminent Dangers of Popery and Slavery.</P>
<P>And We do hereby Declare, That We will, with Our outmost Endeavours, assist his Highness in the obtaining such a Parliament with all speed, wherein Our Laws, Our Liberties and Properties may be secured, the Church of <HI>England</HI> in particular, with due Liberty to Protestant Dissenters, and in general the <HI>Protestant Religion</HI> and <HI>In|terest</HI> over the whole World may be Supported and Encouraged to the Glory of God, the happiness of the established Government in these Kingdoms, and the Advantage of all Princes and States in Christendome, that may be herein concerned.</P>
<P>In the mean time, We will endeavour to preserve as much as in us lies, the Peace and Security of these great and populous Cities of <HI>London</HI> and <HI>Westminster,</HI> and the parts Adjacent, by taking Care to Disarm all <HI>Papists,</HI> and secure all <HI>Jesuits</HI> and <HI>Romish Priests,</HI> who are in or about the same.</P>
<P>And if there be any thing more to be performed by Us, for promoting his High|ness's Generous Intention for the publick Good, We shall be ready to do it as occasion shall Require.</P>
