<HEAD>TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING employed much of my Life in the Practice of Cookery, in all its Branches, I presume to offer the following Sheets to the Public&punc; in hopes that they will find the Directions and Receipts more in|telligible than in most Books of the Kind. I have bestowed every Pain<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> to render them easily practicable, and adapted to the Capacities of those who may be ordered to use them. The waste Language and high Terms on such Subjects, appears to me to render the Art of Cookery embarrassing, and to throw Difficulties in the Way of the Learner&mdash;nor can the Rea|der reasonably expect any superfluous Embellishments of Style from one whose Habits of Life have been active, and not studious.</P>
<P>The Errors and Imperfections of former Treatises first suggested to me that a Performance like the following would be acceptable to the Public. In one Article, that of trussing Poultry, I have endeavoured to give particular and useful Directions, because no Book of this Kind has contained such, that Subject having been universally overlooked by them&mdash;and in this, as well as in all other Branches of the Art of Cookery, I hope the Reader with find much Improvement, and many useful Hints. The Contents I have endeavoured to render as complete as possible, that the Learner may have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Recourse to whatever Article may be wanted.</P>
<P>Aware, however, of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of my Task, I submit this Per|formance, with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, as I am con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">ous that Errors will c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ep into the best Performances, and that the only Merit I can claim is, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> of having corrected the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of former Works, and added the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> Improvements derived from my can Practice and Experience.</P>

<HEAD>Proper Rules to be observed in Marketing, for all Kinds of Provisions.</HEAD>
<P>AS it is very interesting to the house-keeper, cook, or any other person that goes to market, if not well acquainted with the nature of it, to have ample instructions, it is proper to give the best in our power; a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> very often by buying a thing that is not prime and good there are complaints against the dressing or sauce&punc; and therefore it would be well for a person to read this part of marketing, which is given, before they go to bay: by that means it may prevent them from making mistakes, and give great|er satisfaction to their employers and themselves.</P>

<DIV3 TYPE="food item">
<HEAD>BEEF.</HEAD>
<P>In choosing of ox beef, observe that if the meat is young it will have a fine smooth open grain, of a pleasing carnation red, and when you pinch it, will feel tender; the fat must be rather white than yel|low,
<PB N="2" REF="024145_0020_103D6FEDC700A210">
and the suet white and firm; if it is very yel|low it has been fed with oil cakes, or it is not good meat; if it feels rough and spongy, and nips hard, it is old, or nearly so. Heifer, or young cow beef, is closer grained, and the fat whiter than the ox<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> but the lean has not so bright a red; if you can see the udder try if there is any milk, or the teat open, if not you are sure it is young; bull beef has still a clo|ser grain, and the lean of a deep red, the fat is skin|ny and hard, and has a rank smell; be sure to mind there are no bruises, if there is do not buy it, for if you salt it it will be sure to stink.</P>
<P>The different pieces in a bullock contain the head, tongue, and palate, the entrails are the kidney, shirts, and tripe; there is the double, the roll, and the reed tripe the heart, liver, and lights.</P>
<P>The fore quarter contains the haunch, which in|cludes the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">lod&punc; marrow-bone, shin and the sticking pieces, that is the neck end: the next is the leg of mutton piece, which has part of the blade-bone in, then the chuck, the brisket, the fore rib, and middle or chuck rib.</P>
<P>The hind quarter contains the sirloin and rump, the thin and thick flank, the veiny piece, the ich bone, buttock, mouse buttock, and leg.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="food item">
<HEAD>MUTTON.</HEAD>
<P>If the mutton is young, the flesh will pinch ten|der, but if it is old it will pinch hard, and continue wrinkled, and the fat will be fibrous and clammy; if ewe mutton the flesh is paler than weather, a closer grain, and easily parting; if ram mutton the grain is closer, and the lean of a darker red, and the fat spongy; if there is a rot, the lean will be palish, and the fat a faint whitish colour, inclining to yellow, and if you squeeze it hard some drops of water will stand up like sweat; the best method is to examine the li|ver; if it is clear from knots, smooth and sound, you are sure the meat is good. Mutton, except in very hot weather, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> kept four or five days before it is

House lamb is in season from the 1st of September, till July; grass lamb from Easter to October. The lamb con|tains the head and pluck, that is, the liver, lights, heart, nut, and melt, and the fry, which consists of the sweet-bread, stones, skirts, with a little of the liver; the shoulder, neck, and breast together is the fore-quarter, the leg and loin the find. In choosing lamb, be sure to mind it is very white; if it looks brown it will not dress half so well; be sure to buy the ewe leg for boiling, as the udder makes it look handsomer than the ram lamb.</P>

<P>When you buy fresh butter be sure to put the knife in the middle and taste it, if it tastes mild and sweet it is good; if you buy a cask of salt butter have the cask unhooped, the try it in the middle, for very of|ten there is good butter in both ends, and bad in the middle, owing to deceitful package; the Cambridge salt butter is the best, and often in the winter better than fresh if managed properly, by working it up a little, and putting it in spring water a few hours.</P>

end to your tongue, if it feels warm it is new; if it is cold it is stale: and according to the heat or cold it is new or stale: the best method is to hold it up a|gainst the sun, or before a candle, if the yolk ap|pears round and the white clear it is good; but if the yolk is broken, or sticks to the side, the white thick and muddy, it is stale. Another way to try is to put them in cold water, the fresher it is the soon|er it sinks to the bottom; if addled or rotten it will swim on the surface of the water: the Hertfordshire eggs are the largest and best. The best method to keep eggs for use is to bury them in salt; but the sooner they are used the better.</P>
<P>As the poulterers in London always truss all kinds of poultry, it will not be amiss to give the young be|ginner a few instructions how to truss poultry and game, as many are obliged to leave London to go with a family to their country-houses for the summer, and may be very good cooks, but not proficient in drawing and trussing. In the first place, be careful that all the stubs are picked out; and when you draw any kind of fowls, &amp;c. be sure you do not break the gall, as it will give the whole fowl a disagreeable bitterness, that all the washing and wiping cannot remove.</P>

<HEAD>Proper rules to be observed in making Soups and Broths.</HEAD>
<P>IN the first place, take great care that your soup-pots and covers are kept very clean inside and out, and well timed, otherwise the verdigrease will get in them, which is the most pernicious thing of any to the health of those who eat the different soups and broths you make, and give the soups, &amp;c. a

brackish, disagreeable flavour. When you proceed to make any brown soups, such as Gravi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> Vermicelli, or De Santea, always put a little lean ham or bacon at the bottom of your soup-pot or stew pan, and cut your <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> small, as you sooner get the virtue of the meat out, with a little water at the bottom; cut your roots and herbs as directed in the different re|ceipts (be careful always to have them well picked and washed clean before you use them) put them over the meat, with the spices; cover your pot very close, and stew it gently over a slow fire, till you find all the juices of the meat and herbs are drawn out; which will make your soup have a finer flavour, than by pursuing a contrary conduct; always be sure to skim all the fat and scum clean off; soft water is much the best for all kinds of soups and broths, ex|cept green peas soup, and then hard water helps the green colour of your soup. In all white soups never put any fat in of any kind; and be sure to boil your milk or cream before you put it into your soup, and put it in the last thing; boiling prevents it from curdling, which is often the case when put in raw. Gravy and all brown soups, by standing, will have a skim on, which you must take off, and peas soup will settle to the bottom; be sure to stur it well up before you put it into your dish or tureen; let all your ingredients be properly proportioned, that they may not taste of one thing more than another; let the taste be equal, and the whole of an agreeable relish.</P>
<P>Lastly, for all brown or white soups cut the crust of a French roll in round or square pieces, about two inches over, and crisp them before the fire; and for peas soup, toast the bread and cut it in dice, put it before the fire to crisp, as frying bread in butter or fat makes it greasy, and often gives the soup a nau|tions taste.</P>

<HEAD>Proper Rules to be observed in dressing Fish.</HEAD>
<P>AS fish is a curious article in the art of cookery, it will not be amiss to give a chapter adapted entirely for dressing it.</P>
<P>Be careful that your fish-kettles are kept clean from sand, or any thing sticking to the sides, as the scum of the fish will occasion, and that they are well tinned, and the frying-pans the same, your fat well rendered and clear: be sure to have your fish well scaled, gutted, and washed clean, before you dress it; when you boil it use spring water, and be sure to let it boil before you put in the fish with salt accord|ing to the size of the fish; and when broiled or fried dry it well with a cloth, for when it is wet it will not broil well nor fry crisp; never use any vinegar
<PB N="54" REF="024145_0072_103D704E95396538">
to salmon or trout, as it draws the colour out; boil your fish gently, if you boil it quick it often breaks it to pieces, which very much disfigures it, and spoils the beauty of your fish; for when whole and looks well to the sight, it gives the company a good opinion of it; when it boils, and the scum and froth rise, skim it clean off, and take great care that your fish goes hot to table, as nothing is so disagreeable as cold fish.</P>

<HEAD>Proper Rules to be observed in Boiling.</HEAD>
<P>AS neatness and cleanliness is requisite in a kitch|en, as well as in a cook's person as the utensils
<PB N="117" REF="024145_0135_103D70BE852DC670">
it is proper that the cook should see that all the pots, sauce-pans, covers, and every other article, is kept clean from grease and sand, and well tinned. In boiling all kinds of meat and poultry much care and nicety is required, particularly in veal, lamb, and poultry; it is often a great fault in putting too little water in the pot, as that often makes the things look black: be sure always to put in plenty of soft water, make it boil first and skim it well, for veal, lamb, or poultry, before you put it in&punc; As for large joints of beef, mutton, or pork, it is best to put the meat in the water cold, except in the hot summer months, when you cannot make beef salt enough before it will stink; then it is best to put it in the water boiling, to strike the salt in. Before you boil any meat or poultry prepare them in the following manner: singe the poultry, and put them in cold water for one hour; wash the beef, mutton, or pork clean, skew|er the udder or fat of a buttock of beef to the lean, and tie it with a fillet or packthread tight; for veal, lamb, or poultry, take some flour in your hand and rub it all over, rub and wash them well, for the flour will take off all the dirt&punc; put them into the water boiling, with a piece of stale white bread, as the bread will draw all the scum up, and make them look whiter than flour or milk put into the water, or over the meat and poultry&punc; Be sure to boil every thing gently, for if you boil it fast it makes the outside hard before the inside is warm.</P>
<P>Beef and mutton should be rather under done, and allow one hour for every four pounds&punc; veal&punc; pork, and lamb should be thoroughly done&punc; or else it is apt to surfeit&punc; pork in particular: a knuckle of veal of eight pounds will take two hours boiling&punc; a leg of twelve pounds three hours an a half&punc; a leg of pork of twelve pounds four hours, a leg of house-lamb of four pounds one hour and a quarter, a leg of grass-lamb of six pounds one hour and three quarters, and so on in proportion. Be sure to skim the fat and scum off as it rises, and never leave your meat or
<PB N="118" REF="024145_0136_103D70C0B223B180">
poultry in the pot after it is done, as that makes it soddened, and takes out all the juices. If you should be delayed in sending your dinner or supper up in time, take the things out of the water, put them in a dish, cover them close with a cloth, and put the dish over the hot water&punc; and when you want them dip them in the hot water a moment bfore you send them away. This method I have found to be the best in the course of upwards of twenty years practice.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="recipe">
<HEAD>To boil a Haunch or Neck of Venison&punc;</HEAD>
<P>As this is very seldom done, it is proper to give directions for it in case it should be wanted; take a haunch or neck of venison fresh killed and salt it well, turn it, and salt it every day for a week, then put it into water for one hour and wash it clean out, put it into cold water, boil it slowly, skim it very clean, and allow one hour for every four pounds the haunch weighs; boil a cauliflower and pull it into sprigs, boil some white cabbage, mash it with butter and cream, and some turneps the same way; lay a sprig of cauliflower, next cabbage, and next turneps, till you have laid them all round the dish; put in the haunch or neck, garnish the edge of the dish to your fancy with beet-root, and send melted butter and sweet sauce in boats.</P>

<HEAD>Hams.</HEAD>
<P>When you have any very old Westphalia or En|glish hams they require a great deal of socking; the best method is, to put them i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> water over-night, take them out in the morning, and hang them up all day; put them in water again at night, and so pro|ceed for a week, which will make them mellow and fine; if they are not very old two days and two nights

soaking in soft water, changing the water every night and morning, will be sufficient; (a green ham requires no soaking) cut the dirt off the under side, scrape the rind clean, cut the knuckle off at the joint, and wash the ham clean; put it into the copper when the water is warm, as that will set the colour (for if you put it in when the water is cold, it draws all the colour out) when it bails skim it well, and boil it as gently as you can&punc; so the water does but just boil it is sufficient; (a ham of twenty pounds will take five hours, and bigger or less in proportion) when done, take it up and pull of the rind, if it is of a fine red colour put it in the dish, if it is rather pale sift some raspings of bread over it, and put it to the fire till it is brown; or rub it over with the yolk of an egg, and strew bread-crumbs over it, put it to the fire, and turn it round till it is brown all over; garnish with carrots.</P>

some dripping or butter into the dripping-pan, be|fore you lay down your meat or poultry to the fire, to have it melted ready to baste with; singe your poultry with white paper, baste them with butter, dredge on some flour, and sprinkle salt on as soon as you put them to the fire; and the same with all sorts of meat, be sure to baste it well as soon as you lay it down, and sprinkle it with salt&punc; your fire should be regulated according to the thing to be dressed, if it is very little or thin you should have a brisk fire, that you may roast it quick and nice&punc; if it is for large joints, be sure to lay on a good <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words">, and al|ways have it clear at the bottom. When your joint is half done&punc; remove the dripping-pan and spit from the fire&punc; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">nd stir it up to make it burn clear and brisk; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ver put your meat too close to the fire till it is nearly done; for by being to near it often scorches the outside before it is warm within. When it is nearly done the smoke will draw towards the fire; then take the paper off, baste it with butter, sprinkle it with salt, and dredge some flour on, to make it of a fine froth. Pigs and geese should be roasted before a brisk fire, but not too near, and turned quick; hares and rabbits require time and care, and be sure you mind that both ends are done enough: when half roasted cut the skin at the neck-end, to let out the blood, which will prevent them from looking bloody when they are cut up. Wild fowls should have a clear brisk fire, and roasted till they are of a light brown, but not too much, nor till the gravy runs out, as that deprives them of their fine flavour; if you see the gravy begin to run take them up directly. Turkies and tame fowls require more roasting, as they are longer in getting hot through; they should be often basted, in order to keep up a strong froth, as it makes them of a fine colour and rise the better; and it is the best method to keep all sorts of meat well basted, particularly venison, lamb or veal, and also hares; beef and mutton is fatter and does not re|quire so much basting. Be sure to have a fine froth on every thing before you take it from the fire.</P>

<HEAD>Proper Rules to be observed in Stewing and Hashing.</HEAD>
<P>BEFORE you proceed to stew any thing, mind that your stew-pans and covers are free from sand or grease, and well tinned; and have all your ingredients ready to put in at once. Be sure to skin every thing well and clear from fat, as nothing looks worse than to see the fat swim at the top. For hashes, be sure to have your sauce ready before you put the meat in, and that will prevent it from being hard; particularly beef, mutton, and venison, should only be made hot through, for if you let it boil, it makes it tough and hard, and entirely spoils it.</P>

<HEAD>Proper Rules to be observed in Made Dishes.</HEAD>
<P>THIS being one of the most important chapters in this book, it is proper to give the young learners some rules by which to regulate their con|duct. As copper vessels are the best to make all kinds of made dishes in, you must be careful that they are well tinned and kept clean from grease or gri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">iness. In all brown dishes be sure to skim the fat clean off, as nothing looks so disagreeable as to see the fat floating at the top; and when you use wine or an|chovy. put it in some time before your dish is ready, to take the rawness off, as nothing injures the repu|tation of a made dish worse than raw wine or ancho|vy; and be careful that it is of a fine brown and a proper thickness: let none of the ingredients have any predominant taste more than another, which must depend on the judicious manner you mix the various articles you make use of. In white dishes and fri|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">sees, have all your ingredients well stewed and mixed together, and your sauce of a proper thick|ness before you put in eggs or cream, as neither will contribute much to thicken it when you have put them in. Do not put your stew-pan upon the fire, but hold it a proper height over it, and keep shaking it one way till it is thick and smooth, as that will pre|vent it from curdling or sticking to the bottom of the pan, and keep it free from lumps; be careful never to let it boil. When you dish it up take the meat and ingredients out with a fish-slice, strain the
<PB N="183" REF="024145_0201_103D71371095C5F8">
sauce over it, as that will prevent small bits of meat mixing with the sauce, and leave it clear and smooth. Never put any fried force-meat balls into any sauce, but put them on a sieve to drain and keep hot before the fire, till your dish is dished; then put them in, as boiling them in the sauce softens them, and makes them have a greasy appearance. In almost every made dish you may put in what you think proper, to en|large it and make it good; such as sweetbreads, ox palates boiled tender, fresh, pickled, or dried mush|rooms, cockscombs, truffles, morels, artichoke bot|toms, either fresh, boiled, pickled, or dried ones, softened in warm water and cut in four pieces, as|paragus tops, &amp;c. as you can get them, or they are in season; force-meat balls, egg balls, or the yolks of hard eggs. The best things to give a tart|ness to sauce is, lemon juice, elder vinegar, or mush|room pickle. In the use of Cayan pepper, it is best to put but a little in at first, as it is easy to put in more if your sauce requires any; and never put any lemon or four into any white sauce, till the moment before you put it into the dish. When you use flour and butter, mix it together on the back of a trencher, or a clean board, with a knife till it is smooth, as that will prevent its being lumpy when you put it into the sauce.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="rules">
<HEAD>Proper Rules to be observed in dressing Roots and Vegetables.</HEAD>
<P>BE sure to be very careful that your greens, cab|bages. cauliflowers, &amp;c. are picked free from sluggs or fish. and well washed in plenty of water; spinach should always be washed in three or four different waters, as it contains the sand more than any other vegetable; your roots pared clean, or scraped, and well washed; then put them in a sieve, cullender or earthen pan, for fear of sand or dust, which is apt to hang about wooden tubs. Boil all your greens by themselves in plenty of spring water with salt in it; boil no kind of meat with them, as it will make them greasy and discolour them; and never use iron pots or pans, as they are very im|proper vessels for the purpose; let them be copper or brass well tinned, or silver. Take care you do not boil them too much, but let them have a little crispness; for if you boil them too much, you will deprive them of their sweetness and beauty. Let them be well drained before you put them in the dish, as nothing is more disagreeable than to see the dish floating with water.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="recipe">
<HEAD>Greens and Sprouts.</HEAD>
<P>After you have picked and washed them as di|rected, put plenty of spring water into a pot or stew-pan, and when it boils throw in a handful of salt, put in the greens or sprouts, and make them boil up quick; while they are boiling press them down
<PB N="269" REF="024145_0287_103D71D227B09560">
with a skimmer, and try them often, that they may not be boiled too much; when done, take them up in a clean sieve or cullender, and put them over the hot water a few minutes to drain, but not too long, as the steam will make them yellow; then put them in a dish and garnish them with boiled carrot cut in any shape you please, with melted butter in a boat.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="rules">
<HEAD>Proper Rules to be observed in making Puddings.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN you proceed to make your different puddings, have all your ingredients proper|ly prepared in readiness before you begin to mix them: take particular care that your bag or cloth is clean, and not soapy; dip it in boiling water give it a shake, and flour it well, before you put in the pudding. If it is a batter pudding, tie it close; if a bread pudding, tie it a little loose, to give it room to swell; if you boil it in a bason, mould, or bowl, be sure to butter it before you put in the pudding, and tie a cloth over the top; always have plenty of
<PB N="303" REF="024145_0321_103D72115B2ECD20">
water in the pot, and mind it boils before you put in the pudding; see that it keeps boiling, otherwise your pudding will be full of water and spoiled; turn it often, to prevent its sticking to the bottom. When it is done take it up; if in a bason, mould, or bowl, let it stand two or three minutes to cool; if in a cloth or bag, put it in any thing deep enough to hold it; then untie it, take the cloth o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> the mould, &amp;c. lay the upper side of the dish upon it, and turn it over; raise the mould, &amp;c. gently up, if in a cloth untie it, and put the cloth over the edges of what it is in, turn the dish on it, turn it over, and take the cloth gently o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">f for fear of breaking it. When you make a butter pudding, first mix the flour well with a little milk, then put in the other ingredients mix them well to|gether, and it will be smooth and free from lumps. The best method for plain batter pudding is, to strain it through a coarse sieve, to prevent its being lumpy, or having the treadles of the eggs in it: and for all other puddings, strain the eggs after you have beat them. Batter and rice puddings baked, require a brisk oven to raise them; bread and custard puddings, time and a moderate oven. Remember to butter the bottom of your dish or pan all round, before you pour your pudding into it.</P>

<HEAD>PIES.</HEAD>
<DIV3 TYPE="rules">
<HEAD>Proper rules to be observed in making and baking Pies.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN you heat your oven, it must be regu|lated according to the pie you intend to bake: for a venison pasty it must be well heated, as that requires a great deal of soaking; and raised pies must have a quick oven, and well closed up, or else your pie will fall in the sides. Never put any liquor in till it is half baked; then take it out, make a hole in the middle of the lid, and with a funnel put in what gravy you think fit: by this means your ingre|dients in the pie will eat better, and prevent it from looking soddened; and if the pie is raised properly it will not run, for when it runs it always spoils it. For light puff-paste a moderate heated oven, but not too slack, as that will deprive it of the light appear|ance it should have; and a quick oven will catch
<PB N="336" REF="024145_0354_103D724D8947A028">
and burn it, without giving it time to rise: the best way is, to roll out a bit of paste and put it into the oven, to try whether it is too hot or not, leed tarts should have a slow oven, or the icing will be brown before the paste is thoroughly baked. When you put in a venison pasty, raised or meat pie, put a sheet of paper over it, and that will prevent it from catching.</P>
<P>Great care must be taken of the butter for making paste, according to the different seasons, in order to make it light and good: in cold weather it should be worked well, to make it pliable; and if salt butter, well washed in fresh water. In hot weather you should put it in a cold cellar the over-night, in the morning put it in cold spring water, and handle it as little as possible. Make your paste in hot weather as early as you can in the morning, before the sun has too much power, and keep it in a cold place till you want to bake it.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="recipe">
<HEAD>Puff-Paste.</HEAD>
<P>Take a quarter of a peck of fine flour, and rub in a pound of butter till it is fine, make it up in a light paste with cold water, stiff enough to work it up, but do not work it too much, as that will make it heavy; then roll it out about as thick as a crown piece, put a layer of butter in lumps as big as a nut|meg all over it, sprinkle a little flour over it, and double it, roll it out again, and double it three or four times, then it will be sit for use, either for pies, tarts, or any thing else that requires it. You may make a larger or smaller quantity, by adding or di|minishing the quantity of flour and butter.</P>

chapter, it will not be improper to end it with small pastry. When you use preserved fruit for tarts, the best method will be to put them into glass patty-pans, and cut a cover out of crocant past into any shape you please, bake it on a tin by itself, and put it over the fruit in the glass, for the oven spoils preserves, ex|cept rasberry jam. When you make bottled fruit into tarts, such as gooseberries, damsons, and cran|berries, put them into china or earthenware patty-pans, sweeten them with sugar, put a thin puff-paste over them, and ice them. If you make them in tin patty-pans to turn out, sprinkle some flour on the patty-pans, lay a thin tart paste in, then put in the fruit and sugar, and a thin crust at the top, ice them, and bake them in a slow oven: and as soon as they are done slip them out of the patty-pans, or loosen them; for if you let them stand to be cold you will not get them out without breaking them to pieces; for apple tarts, you must pare, quarter, and core the apples, if they are large cut the quarters in two, and put them in with a little lemon-peel chopped fine, and a little marmalade of quinces, with sugar over them; or you may put the apples into a sauce-pan, with a lit|tle water and a little lemon-peel, and boil them till they are tender; take out the lemon-peel, bruise them fine, and sweeten them with sugar; when they are cold put them into the patty-pans and make them the same as bottled fruit, and ice them; you may make green gooseberry, or all sorts of ripe fruit, into tarts, such as currants, cherries of all sorts, plumbs, damsons, white bullace, apricots, &amp;c. the same as bottled fruit.</P>

<P>Let your sauce-pan be very clean and nice; when the water boils put in your chicken, which must be very nicely pickt and clean, and laid in cold water a quarter of an hour before it is boiled, then take it out of the water boiling, and lay it in a pewter dish. Save all the liquor that runs from it in the dish, cut up your chicken all in joints in the dish, then bruise the liver very fine, add a little boiled parsley chop|ped fine, a very little salt, and a little grated nutmeg; mix it all well together with two spoonsful of the liquor of the fowl, and pour it into the dish with the rest of the liquor in the dish; if there is not liquor enough, take two or three spoonsful of the liquor it was boiled in, clap another dish over it. Then set it over a chafing dish of hot coals five or six minutes, and carry it to table hot with the cover on. This is better than butter, and lighter for the stomach, though some chuse it only with the liquor, and no parsley, not liver, and that is according to different palates: it is for a very weak person. Take off the skin of the chicken before you set it on the chafing-dish. If you roast it, make nothing but bread-sauce, and that is lighter than any sauce you can make for a weak stomach,</P>

<HEAD>Rules to be observed in Preserving.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN you make your syrups for preserves, al|ways pound your sugar, and let it dissolve in the syrup before you put it on the fire, as it will occasion the scum to rise, and make your syrup of a better colour. You must be careful not to boil any kind of jellies or syrups too high, as that will make them dark and cloudy; be sure not to keep green sweetmeats longer in the first syrup than directed, or they will lose their colour. The same care is re|quired for oranges and lemons, when you preserve fruit with their stones, such as cherries, damsons, &amp;c. render mutton suet and put over them, tie a bladder over the top, and thick paper over that. to keep out the air; for if the air gets to them it will turn them four, which you may know by the syrup's fretting

and rising above the suet. Wet or dry sweetmeats should be kept in a dry cool place, as a hot place will deprive them of their virtue, and a damp place will turn them mouldy; be sure to let the syrup be above the fruit, and cut writing paper in the shape of your pot or glass, notch it all round the edge, dip it into brandy, lay it close on the top of your sweetmeats, then tie a thick paper over that, as you cannot be too careful in tying them down close to keep out the air, as you will find yourself in a great fault if you leave the pots open, or tie them down carlessly.</P>

<HEAD>Proper Rules to be observed in making Cakes.</HEAD>
<P>BEFORE you intend to finish your cake, be sure to have all your ingredients ready prepared to your hand, and never beat up your eggs till the last thing, and never leave them to go about any thing else till they are finished, as the eggs by standing un|mixed will require fresh beating, which will occasion your cake to be heavy. When you intend to put butter in your cakes, be sure to beat it with your hand to a fine cream before you mix it with sugar, or else it will require double the beating and will not an|swer your purpose half so well: all cakes made with rice, seeds, or plumbs, is best baked in wooden hoops, for when they are baked in tins or pans the outside of your cake will be burned, and will be so much confined, that the heat cannot penetrate into the middle of your cake, and prevent it from rising; the best method is, to put a round tin in the middle of your large cakes, and then you will have it thorough|ly baked</P>
<P>All kinds of cakes should be baked in a well-heated oven, heated according to the size of your cake.</P>

<P>WHEN you intend to bake your meat, &amp;c. before you send it to the oven be sure to season it properly, and cover it with butter, tie it over with strong paper, and bake it gently and well till it is tender. As soon as it comes from the oven, drain all the butter and gravy from the meat, and carefully pick out all the gristles and skins, for if they are left in, when you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ut the meat they will spoil the beauty of it, and the gravy would soon turn

it sour. Be sure to beat your seasoning very fine, and sift it through a sieve before you put it to your meat, and put it in by degrees as you beat the meat; and when you put your meat into pots, press it well down, and never pour your clarified butter over your meat till it is quite cold. When you clarify butter put it in a deep dish, and set it before the fire to melt; and when it is melted drain it from the set|tlings at the bottom, and if any scum rises skim it off, or put it into a clean stew-pan and melt it gently, skim it and pour it from the settlings; (as it is the whey that is at the bottom, consequently it will turn your potted meats, birds, &amp;c. sour, and soon make them mould and stink) if you want to turn it whole out of your pots, butter them well before you put in the meat, and when you want to turn them out, put the pot a few minutes in hot water and then it will slip out.</P>

<P>You must take a fine large turkey, dress it very clean, dry and bone it, and then tie it up as you do sturgeon; put into the pot you boil it in, one quart of white wine, one quart of water, one quart of good vinegar, and a large handful of salt; let it boil, skim it well, and then put in the turkey; when it is enough take it out, tie it tighter, and let the liquor boil a little longer; (and if you think the pickle wants more vinegar or salt, add it) when it is cold, pour it upon the turkey, and it will keep some months, covering it close from the air, and keeping it in a dry, cool place.

<HEAD>Proper Rules to be observed in Pickling.</HEAD>
<P>AS pickles are a very necessary article in all fam|ilies, it is requisite that every housekeeper, should make her own, and not be obliged to buy them at shops, where they are often badly prepared, by putting in pernicious ingredients to please the eye. Stone jars, well glazed, are best for all kinds of pickles to be kept in; they are, to be sure, expen|sive
<PB N="499" REF="024145_0517_103D7376974E3790">
at first, but, with care, they will last many years, and in the end, be found cheaper than earthen vessels; as it has, by experience, been found, that salt and vinegar will penetrate through common earthen ves|sels, and leave the pickles dry, especially when put in hot. When you take out any pickles never put your hands in, but make use of a wooden spoon kept for that purpose, otherwise your pickles will spoil soon; and always take care that they are covered with vinegar, and tie them down close after you take any out; by this method, and observing the differ|ent receipts, you can never err. As vinegar is the grand menstruum for all kinds of pickles, it will be proper to give directions for making it.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="recipe">
<HEAD>White Wine Vinegar.</HEAD>
<P>As this vinegar, by the name, is thought to be made from white wine only, it is proper to give di|rections for making it: when you brew in the month of March or April, take as much sweet wort of the first running as will serve you the year, boil it with|out hops for half an hour, and then put it in a cool|er; put some good yeast upon it, and work it well; when it is done working, break the yeast into it, and put it into a cask, but mind to fill the cask, and set it in a place where the sun has full power on it; put no bung in the bung-hole, but put a tile over it at night, and when it rains; (but when it is fine take the tile off) let it stand till it is quite sour, which will be in the beginning of September; then draw it off from the settlings into another cask, let it stand till it is fine, then draw it off for use.</P>
<P>If you have any white wine that is tart put it in a cask, and treat it in the same manner; or cyder may be done the same way; a cask of ale turned sour makes ale vinegar in the same manner; but none of these are sit for pickles to keep long, except the first white wine vinegar.</P>

<HEAD>Birch Wine.</HEAD>
<P>The season for procuring the liquor from the birch trees is in the beginning of March, while the sap is rising, and before the leaves shoot out; for when the sap is come forward, and the leaves appear, the juice, by being long digested in the bark, grows thick and coloured, which before was thin and clear.</P>
<P>The method of procuring the juice is by boring holes in the body of the tree, and putting in fosters, which are commonly made of the branches of elder, the pith being taken out. You may, without hurt|ing the tree, if large, tap it in several places, four or five at a time; and by that means save, from a good many trees, several gallons every day. If you have not enough in one day, the bottles, in which it drops, must be corked close, and rofined or waxed; however, make use of it as soon as you can.</P>
<P>Take the sap and boil it as long as any scum rises, skimming it all the time; to every gallon of liquor

<HEAD>CHAP. XXXVII.</HEAD>
<HEAD>BREWING.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING given directions for the making of wines and cordial waters, it would be thought an unpardonable omission to pass over malt liquors unnoticed. We do not mean to enter on all the va|rious branches of brewing, it being foreign to our present purpose.</P>
<P>All we intend, is to give general directions for brewing, managing, and keeping such strong small beer that may be necessary in a large family.</P>
<P>The first consideration is, the being provided with proper implements; and the copper appearing the first object;</P>
<P>The manner of setting and position of the copper are first for our consideration: and the proper method is, to divide the fire by a stop; and if the door and draught be in a direct line, the stop should be erected from the middle of each outline of the grating, and parallel with the centre sides of the copper: by this method the middle of the fire will be directly under the bottom of the copper. The stop is composed of a thin wall in the centre of the right and left sides of the copper, which is to ascend half the height of the copper; on the top must be left a cavity, from four to six inches, for a draught for the half-part of the fire, which is next the door of the copper, and then the building must close all round to the finishing at the top.</P>
<P>By this mode of erecting your copper, the heat will communicate from the outward part of your fire round the outward half of your copper, through the cavity, as does the farthest part of the flue, which also contracts a conjunction of the whole, and causes
<PB N="540" REF="024145_0558_103D73A81CED8C50">
the flame to glide gently and equally round the bot|tom of your copper.</P>
<P>Several advantages are derived from this mode of proceeding: the fuel being an object, is thereby <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> saved; it has the superiority of wheel-draughts: with them, if very particular attention is not paid to the hops, by stirring them down, they are liable to stick to the sides and scorch. This will very much hurt the flavour of your liquor. The cop|per, by this method, will last many years longer than by a wheel-draught; that drawing with so much violence, that if your liquor be beneath the communication of the fire, the copper will be liable to be damaged; so that by the other contrivances you may boil half a copper full without injury. There is a great advantage in this, it being impossible to draw it clean off the mash.</P>
<P>To give greater expedition to the operation, you may wish to extend this advantage to a few pailsful, which is done without injury to the other; the whole of the other being drawn off, the copper will accom|plish your intended purpose next morning, which will prevent disturbing your rest; it running the whole night, will be ready to boil in the morning, and fit to be added to the working of the other small beer. In time the whole will be rendered complete for turning.</P>
<P>In pursuing this method, you are not under the necessity of having your copper turned, which is not only disagreeable, but attended with a great expence.</P>
<P>Other inconveniencies are too frequently found in coppers, their having been made too exact to their intended quantity; the consequence being, that there is not sufficient room for boiling the liquor in, with any degree of rapidity or safety, which must be na|turally supposed to be essential points. This incon|venience may be remedied: prepare good seasoned pieces of elm, or any other proper wood, then shape them like the viller of a waggon wheel, being half its thickness, and join them round, to make the di|mensions of the circle of your copper. The rim of
<PB N="541" REF="024145_0559_103D73D52472DB38">
the copper, which turns over as a bearing at the top, may be beat up, and that part nailed to the bottom part of the wood-work, ingrafting between the cop|per and wood-work, a cement, such as whiting and bullock's blood, of the thickness of common white|wash. This will prevent any leak, and last a great while.</P>
<P>Using this precaution, not to let the wood-work join nearer than seven or eight inches to the copper flue, or the communication of the heat; if there be any fear of penetrating through that direction, nail either copper or plate iron; observing the above ce|ment being equal to any solder for this purpose.</P>
<P>This method is recommended only where stop|draughts are used; where wood may be applied with safety, the fires of these never being so furious that any damage can be done. For erecting other cop|pers on different constructions, stone, brick, or tarris mortar may be used.</P>
<P>Coolers being of no small consequence, and the next thing to be considered, for not being properly taken care of, the liquor, by some seemingly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> countable cause, will have a disagreeable tang. Great care should be taken of their being well scalded and washed; and likewise that no dirty soap-suds are slopped upon them, which often happens, by permit|ting washing to be done in the brewhouse.</P>
<P>In preparing your coolers, never let the water stand in them too long, as it will turn putrid, and the stench entering the wood, will render them almost incurable. But to prevent such consequences, all coolers ought to be leaded, being exceedingly cleanly, and a great help in cooling part of your liquor-worts, which is necessary to the working it, as well as for the cooling; the whole evaporation causing more waste than proper boiling.</P>
<P>Also let your coolers be scoured well two or three times with cold water, it being more proper than hot to effect a perfect cleansing; hot water will not only drive the infection further, but if your drink be let into the coolers, and if any remain in the crevi|ces,
<PB N="542" REF="024145_0560_103D73A9F770C790">
the heat will collect the foulness, and render it unwholesome.</P>
<P>Some persons who pretend to be judges of this matter, argue, that ropiness in beer proceeds from the want of a sufficient quantity of hops, to dispel the glutinous richness arising from the goodness of the malt; which is a mistake, save when it is boiled too much.</P>
<P>Others argue, that it is by applying the water too sharp, that is, too hot, to mash with; but if the water did not produce that fault, it has another equally dangerous, that is, when you mash with wa|ter so exceedingly hot it is liable to set the malt, which will clog it up so that it is almost impossible for it to run off: and when you have got over that difficulty by art, it never answers in point of goodness.</P>
<P>As a proof of heats and colds, which must be ap|plicable in the case of brewing, proceed thus:&mdash;Take a pail of cold water, throw it on a quantity of grains, and it will almost immediately become ropy. Some brewers will put cold water on the mash, and imagine that it gets out the whole of the strength; but it is impossible for this to meet with a favourable reception, considering the improbability thereof, though they say it makes excellent toplash, or rather rot-gut small beer.</P>
<P>Many families having a particular aversion to brewing, from a conception of the trouble, and the enormous expence attending the fitting up a brew|house: but if properly made, a whole set of coolers may be removed from house to house with great fa|cility and little expence, provided they be made as hereafter mentioned.</P>
<P>Strong frames must be constructed for each cooler, in such a manner, that they may be unwedged and taken asunder when occasion requires. The outside frame should turn up pretty high, that is, sufficiently thick and strong to cut a proper inlet to receive wedges for the purposes hereafter mentioned; form your coolers, which are to consist of common planed deal boards, and lay them even to fit on this frame, which,
<PB N="543" REF="024145_0561_103D73D6F9DCBA98">
from a projection and inlet, you can set the side to the bottom; and it will be necessary the inlet should be a little lower than where the bottom rests; by these means the wedges will have full power to tighten the sides to as great an extremity as a hooped barrel. And these wedges should be in three regular directions on the sides, and at two places at each end, which will form perfect firmness. If the cooler be made in regular sizes under each other, you may set strong castors in mortices under the legs, by which means you can drive them under each other, so as the whole to go under the uppermost, which is a good method of setting them out of harm's way. By this mode of construction the chief of your brewing uten|sils, the copper excepted, may be unwedged, and with little trouble packed into a waggon in the space of two hours, and set up in another brewhouse in the like time.</P>
<P>And even if you should choose at any time to dis|pose of the materials, that may be done without loss, as the boards will not be damaged by either nails, pins, or screws; and a small quantity, such as a hogs|head, is required, which may be made like drawers, pulling out in grooves, and resting on trestles, which may be very conveniently put out of danger, as be|forementioned.</P>
<P>You must keep the mash-tub perfectly clean; no grains should be left in it any longer than the day after brewing, for fear it should sour the tubs; for should there be a sour smell in the brewhouse before the beer is tunned, it may infect your liquor and worts.</P>
<P>To make your tub more perfect and lasting, take a circular piece of brass or copper, to inlay and line the hole where the pen-staff enters, to let the wort run off into the under back. The pen-staff should be also stoutly serrulled with the same metal, and both well and properly finished, as you may with ease place it properly: using this mode, it will run from the fineness of a thread to the fulness of an inch tube, &amp;c. first dressing your mash-basket with little
<PB N="544" REF="024145_0562_103D73ABCFB75C78">
bushy furze, without stems or straw, six or eight inches in, from the bottom of your basket, and set quite perpendicularly over the whole, with the pen-staff through the centre of the basket and the middle of the furze or straw, and fastened into the hole of the tub. You must keep it properly steady; and for that purpose take a piece of iron, let it into a staple fastened to the tub, or the nearest part opposite to the basket, and to reach nearly to it; and from that piece another, added to a jointed swivel, or any other contrivance, so as to be at liberty to let round the basket like a dog-collar, and to enter into a staple formed with the same to pin it fast; and by adding a half-circular turn in the collar, in which you have room to drive in a wedge, which will keep it safe down to the bottom, when there can be no danger of its being disturbed by stirring the mash, which will otherwise sometimes be the case. When you let go, you will raise the pen-staff to your own degree of running; then fasten the staff by the help of two wedges, tightened between the staff and the basket.</P>
<P>The copper, in process of time, like every thing else, will become defective; when it happens, this simple remedy will make it as perfect as ever: work the pen-staff in the brass socket with emery and water, or oil, which will make it as perfect as when new.</P>
<P>As an addition to the under-backs, get a piece of copper to line the hole in the bottom, which may be stopped with a cloth put singly round a large cork; and when fastened down for the wort to run, it will be necessary to put a large weight on the cork, which will prevent its flying up by the heat. When the liquor is pumped clean out of the back, the cloth round the cork will enable you to take it out with case; and there should be a drain below the under-back to carry off the water, which will enable you to wash it clean with little trouble. This drain should be made with a clear descent, so that no damp may remain under the back. With the conveyance of water running into your copper, you may be ena|bled
<PB N="545" REF="024145_0563_103D73D92A5BDB58">
to work that water in a double quantity; your under-back being filled by the means of letting it in at your leisure out of your copper, through a shoot to the mash-tub, and so to the under-back; thus you will have a referre against the time you wish to fill your copper, which may be compleated in a few minutes, by pumping while the upper cock is ren|ning.</P>
<P>Thus much for the principles of brewing, but be cautious to keep every thing clean.</P>
<P>Having explained the necessary precautions in pre|paring the vessels, I shall make some observations to be observed in the course of brewing.</P>
<P>Your utensils being well scalded, your malt ground, your copper boiling, and your pen-staff well set, pro|ceed to mash, by letting a sufficient quantity of boil|ing water into your tub, in which it must stand till the steam having gone off, so as you may see your own shadow in it. One person should pour the malt gently in, while another should carefully stir it; for as much care should be observed when the mash is thin as when thick.</P>
<P>This being effectually done, and having a reserve of malt, to prevent evaporation, cover your tub with sacks, &amp;c. and leave your malt three hours to steep.</P>
<P>Before you let the mask run, you should not fail to be prepared with a vessel to catch the first flush, being generally thickish; and another vessel being applied while you return the first on the mash, and so on for two or three times, till it runs fine. Your copper should be boiling at this time, and a tub placed close to your mash-tub; let into it through your spout half the quantity of boiling water you mean to use for drawing off your best wort. This being done, turn your cock to fill up again directly, which will boil in due time, heated with coal ashes, cinders, &amp;c. All this time you must stop the mash with the hot water out of the tub, in moderate quantities, every ten or a dozen minutes, until the whole be consumed; then let off the remaining quantity, boiling hot, to the finishing purpose, for strong beer.</P>
<P><PB N="546" REF="024145_0564_103D73AD509FA938">
Then fill your copper quite full, as it may boil quickly, for a second mash: whether you intend it for ale or small beer, being so prepared, let off the remaining quantity of water into the tub, as was done for the strong beer, stopped up as before; but if you would have small beer besides, you must judge accordingly, by boiling a proper quantity off in due time, and letting it into the tub as before. Avoid the latter article if you can, that you may draw out the strength for ale.</P>
<P>Forty-eight bushels of malt will make four hogs|heads of good strong beer as need be, and also four hogshead of very good ale; the strong beer should be kept two or three years, and the ale one year, before tapped. If your mash be only for one hogs|head, it should be two hours running off; if two hogsheads, two hours and a half; and for any greater quantity, three hours; for it should not stay too long, as the strength may be exhausted by the frequent droppings.</P>
<P>Great care must be taken in the time of steeping your mashes, strong beer three hours, ale one hour, and if small beer half an hour. By thus proceeding, the boilings will take place regularly after each other, and prevent loss of time. Take great care, in the coarse of each mashing, that it is thoroughly stirred from the bottom, and particularly round the mash basket, as it will prevent a stagnation in the whole body of the mash; and by omitting this last process it will fox your beer, and give it but an indif|ferent taste.</P>
<P>In preparing for the boiling, be very careful to put the hops in with the first wort, or it will char in a few minutes. As soon as the copper is full, make a good fire under it; but be careful in filling it, leaving room enough for boiling: boiling quick is necessary to be observed, though in this there are different opinions; perhaps there is but one good method, that is, boiling quick. Particular caution should be observed when it begins to swell in waves in the copper; if you have no assistant, be particu|larly
<PB N="547" REF="024145_0565_103D73DB2A7A86E8">
attentive to its motions, having an iron rod of a proper length, crooked at one end, and jagged at the other; with the crook you open the copper door, and the other end push in the damper without moving. On the first swell you will have sufficient time to pro|portionate your fire; great precaution should be taken that it is not too predominant: and when the boil is properly got under, add a fire to boil briskly, va|rying a few minutes.</P>
<P>As to the time it should boil, an experienced brew|er provides a copper bowl dish, and with it takes out some of the liquor, and when he discovers a working and that the hops sink, be concludes it sufficiently boil|ed. Sometimes this is compleated in thirty or forty minutes; but according to the different qualities of the malt, this rule is often extended to five or ten mi|nutes. Long and slow boiling is pernicious, as well as wasting the liquor: the flower it boils the lower it drops, and singes to your copper; quick boiling has a contrary effect. Essence of malt is extracted by long boiling; for by so doing you may make it as thick as treacle or honey.</P>
<P>After the liquor is properly boiled, run a small quantity over all the coolers, so as to have a proper quantity cold immediately to go to work. If the airiness of your brewhouse will not expedite a quan|tity soon, you must run a second quantity over the coolers, and let them into shallow tube; put these into any place where there is a thorough air, but where no rain or wet can get to it. Let off the quantity of two baring-tubsful from the first over the second and third coolers, which may be soon got cold, to be ready for a speedy working, and then the remaining part that is in your copper may be quite let out into the first cooler.</P>
<P>In the interim mend your fire and attend to the hops to make a clear passage through the strainer; and as soon as the liquor is done running return to your business of pumping; but remember, that when you have got five or six pailsful, return all the hops into the copper for ale.</P>
<P><PB N="548" REF="024145_0566_103D73AFCAF57350">
By this time, the quantity of liquor let into your coolers being properly cooled, you must proceed to set your liquor to work; take four quarts of baum, and divide half of it into small vessels, such as ba|sons or mugs, adding to it an equal quantity of wort, which should be almost cold; as soon as it ferments to the top of the vessel put it into two pails, and when that works to the top put one into a baring-tub, and the other into another; when you have half a baring-tub full together, put the like quantity to each of them, cover them, until it comes to a fine head; this may be compleated in three hours: put these two quantities into a working-guile; you may now add as much wort as you have got ready, you cannot work it too cold in open weather.</P>
<P>If you brew in cold frosty weather, keep the brew|house warm, but never add hot wort, to keep the liquor to blood heat, that being a bad maxim; for hot wort put to cold, as well as cold to hot, is so in|temperate in its nature, that it stagnates the proper operation of the baum.</P>
<P>Be careful that your baum be not from foxed beer, that is, beer heated too much by its working, for it is likely to carry the contagion. If your baum be flat, and you cannot procure that which is new, the method of recovering its working is by adding to it a pint of warm sweet-wort of your first letting off, the heat to be of half the degree of milk-warm; then give your mug that contains it a shake, and it will soon gather strength, and be fit for use.</P>
<P>I shall conclude this matter with observing, that a pound of good hops is sufficient for two bushels of malt, for strong beer to keep for four years; twelve bushels to the hogshead.</P>
<P>Your casks being perfectly clean, sweet, and dry, and set on the stand ready to receive the liquor, first skim off the top baum, then proceed to fill your casks quite full, immediately bung and peg them close; bore a hold with a tap-borer near the summit of the stave, at the same distance from the top as the lower tap-hole is from the bottom, for working through
<PB N="549" REF="024145_0567_103D73DD157CCF08">
that upper hole which is clean, and more effectual method, than working it over the cask; for by the above method, being so closely confined, it soon sets itself into a convulsive motion, and forces itself fine, provided you attend to the filling of your casks five or six times a day; for by too long an omission it begins to settle, and afterwards being disturbed, it raises a sharp fermentation, which produces an inces|sant working of a spurious froth that may continue for some weeks; and after all give your beer a crankish taste, which proper attention might have prevented.</P>
<P>Having gone through the practical part of brew|ing, I shall proceed to instruct the housekeeper in the management of malt liquors, the proper time for brewing; and shall make some observations on the different qualities of water, malt, and hops.</P>
<P>The month of March is generally considered as one of the principal seasons for brewing malt liquors for long keeping; and the reason is, because the air at that time of the year is temperate, and contri|butes to the good working or fermentation of the liquor, which principally promotes its preservation and keeping good. Very cold as well as very hot weather prevents the free fermentation of working of liquors; so that if you brew in very cold weather, unless you use some means to warm the cellar while new drink is working, it will never clear itself in the manner you wish; and the same misfortune will arise, if, in very hot weather, the cellar is not in a very temperate state; the consequence of all which will be, that such drink will be muddy and sour, perhaps beyond recovery. Such misfortunes often happen, even in the proper season for brewing, and that owing to the badness of a cellar; for when they are dug in springy grounds, they are subject to damps in the winter, the liquor will chill, grow flat and dead. Where cellars are of this nature, it will be adviseable to make your brewings in March, rather than October, for you may keep such cellars tempe|rate in summer, but cannot warm them in winter:
<PB N="550" REF="024145_0568_103D73B14D0F23C0">
thus the beer brewed in March will have time to set|tle itself, before the cold can materially injure it.</P>
<P>Cellars for keeping of liquor ought to be built so that no external air can get into them; for the vari|ation of the air abroad, were there free admission of it into the cellars, would cause many alterations in the liquor, and would keep it in so unsettled a state, as to render it unfit for drinking. Some persons, curious in these matters, have double doors to their cellars, with a view that none of the external air may <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> a way into them; and are amply repaid for their care and expence by the goodness of their li|quor. The intent of the double door is, to keep one shut while the other is open, that the external air may be excluded. Such cellars, if they lie dry, as they ought to do, are said to be cold in summer and warm in winter; though, in reality, they are constantly the same in point of temperature. They seem, indeed, cold in hot weather, but that is only because we go into them from a hotter air&mdash;abroad the same mode of reasoning will hold good, with respect to their appearing warmer in winter. Hence it is evident, that they are only cold or warm, com|paratively as the air we come out of is colder or warmer. This should be the peculiar property of a cellar, if we expect to have good liquor out of it.</P>
<P>As for the brewing part, having already considered the matter, what we shall therefore further touch upon, besides speaking of cellaring, will relate to the water, malt, hops, and the proper method of keeping liquors.</P>
<P>The best water is river water, such as is soft, and has partaken of the air and sun; for this easily insi|nuates itself into the malt, and extracts its virtues; on the contrary, hard waters astringe and bind the pores of the malt, so that its virtues are not freely communicated to the liquor. It is a rule with some, that all water that will mix with soap is fit for brew|ing, and they will by no means allow of any other; and it has been more than once experienced, that where the same quantity of malt has been used to a
<PB N="551" REF="024145_0569_103D73DE9694A7A8">
barrel of river water, as to a barrel of spring water, the river water brewing has excelled the other in strength above five degrees in twelve months. It must be observed, that the malt was not only the same in quantity for one barrel as another, but was the same in quality, having been all measured from the same heap; the hops were also the same, both in quality and quantity, and the time of boiling equal in each; they were worked in the same manner, tunned and kept in the same cellar. Here it is evi|dent, the only difference was in the water, and yet one barrel was worth two of the other.</P>
<P>Dorchester beer, which is so much admired, is, for the most part, brewed of chalky water, which is al|most every where in that county: and as the soil is generally chalk, the cellars being dug in that dry soil, contribute to the good keeping of their drink; it being of a close texture, and of a drying quality, so as to dissipate damps; for damp cellars, we find by experience, are injurious to the keeping of liquors, as well as destructive to the casks. A constant temperate air digests and soften malt liquors, so that they taste quite smooth on the palate; but in cellars, which are unequal by letting in heats and colds, the liquor is subject to grow stale and sharp. For this reason it is, that liquor brewed for long voy|ages at sea, should be perfectly ripe and fine before it is exported; for when it has had sufficient time to digest in the cask, and is racked from the bottom or lee, it will bear carriage without injury.</P>
<P>It has been observed, that in proportion to the quantity which is inclosed in one cask, so will it be a longer or shorter time in ripening. A vessel contain|ing two hogsheads of beer, will require twice as much to perfect itself as one of a hogshead: and it is found by experience, that no vessel should be used for strong beer, which is intended to be kept, less than a hogshead; as one of that quantity, if it be fit to draw in a year, has body enough to support it two, three, or four years, if it has strength of malt and hops in it, as the Dorchester beer has.</P>
<P><PB N="552" REF="024145_0570_103D73B322783800">
Should the water be of a hard nature, it may be softened by exposing it to the air and sun, and in|fusing into it some pieces of chalk. When the water is set on to boil, in order to be poured on the malt, put into it a quantity of bran, which will soften it a little.</P>
<P>Another matter is to be mentioned, in regard to the preserving of strong beer, and that is, when once the vessel be broached, regard ought to be had to the time in which it will be expended; for if there hap|pens to be a quick draught for it, then it will continue good to the very bottom; but if there be likely to be but a slow draught, then do not draw off quite half before you bottle it, otherwise your beer will grow flat, dead, and sour. This is observed among the curious.</P>
<P>I shall mention two or three particulars relative to malt, which may help those who are unacquainted with brewing. In the first place, the general distinc|tion between one malt and another is only, that the one is high and the other is low dried; that which we call high-dried, will, when brewed, produce a liquor of a deep brown colour; and the other, which is the low-dried, will produce a liquor of a pale co|lour. The first is dried in such a manner as may be said to be rather scorched than dried, and is far less wholesome than the pale malt. It has also been ex|perienced, that brown malt, although it be well brewed, will sooner turn sharp than the pale malt, if that be fairly brewed.</P>
<P>A very experienced person in the brewing line says, that the brown malt makes rather the best drink, when it is brewed with a coarse river water, such as the river Thames, at London; and that being brewed with such water makes very good ale, but will not keep above five or six months without turning stale and a little sharp, even though he allows fourteen bushels to the hogshead. He says he has tried the high-dried malt to brew beer with for keeping, and hopped it accordingly, and yet he could never brew it so as to drink soft and mellow, like that brewed
<PB N="553" REF="024145_0571_103D73E06D2D4308">
with pale malt; there being an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> quality in high-dried malt, which occasions that distemper commonly called the heart-burn, in those that drink of the ale or beer made of it.</P>
<P>What has been here said of malt is meant that made of barley, for wheat malt, pea malt, or those mixed with barley malt, though they produce a high-coloured liquor, will keep many years, and drink smooth and soft; yet they have the mum flavour.</P>
<P>Many persons, who brewed with high dried barley malt, put a bag, containing about three pints of wheat, into every hogshead of liquor, which has fined it, and made it drink mellow; others have put about three pints of wheat malt into a hogshead, which has produced the same effect. But all malt liquors, however well brewed, may be spoiled by bad cellaring, and be now and then subject to ferment in the cask, and turn thick and sour. The best way to prevent this and bring the liquor to itself is, to open the bung of the cask for two or three days; if that does not stop the fermentation, put in two or three pounds of oyster shells, washed, dried well in an oven, and then beaten to fine powder, stir it a little and it will presently settle the liquor, make it fine and take off the sharp taste. As soon as that is done, draw it off in another ves|sel, and put a small bag of wheat, or wheat malt, into it, as before directed, or in proportion to the size of the vessel. Sometimes such fermentations will happen in liquor by change of weather, if it be in a bad cellar, and will, in a few months, fall fine of itself, and grow mellow.</P>
<P>Malt high-dried should not be used in brewing till it has been ground ten days or a fortnight, as it then yields much stronger drink than the same quantity of malt just ground. But if you design to keep malt ground some time before you use it, take care to keep it very dry, and the air at that time must be dry. As for pale malt, which has not par|taken so much of the fire, it must not remain ground above a week be|fore you use it.</P>
<P>As for hops, the newest are best, though they will remain good two years, but afterwards they begin to lose their good flavour, unless great quantities are kept together, in which case they will keep longer good than them in small quantities; and for their better preservation, they should be kept in a dry and cool place, that they may not lose any of their weight. The method used to recover stale and decayed hops and retain their bitterness, unbag them, sprinkle them with aloes and water, which, when it has proved a bad hop year, has spoiled great quantities of malt liquor about London; for where the water, the malt, the brewers, and the cellars, be each good, a bad hop will spoil all. Hence it is evident, that every one of these particulars, before the brewing is set about, should be attended to, or else you must expect but a bad ac|count of your labour: so likewise the rest of your baum, which you work your liquor with, must be well considered, or a good brewing be spoiled by that alone: and be provided with every thing material before you begin brewing, as the wort will not wait for any thing.</P>
<P>In some remote places they dip whisks into yeast, then beat it well; hang up the whisks with the yeast in them to dry; and if there be no brewing till two months afterwards, the beating and stirring one of
<PB N="554" REF="024145_0572_103D73B55E06DBF0">
these new whisks in new wort will raise a working, or fermentation in it. It being a rule, that all liquor should be worked well in the tun, or keep before it is put into the vessel, or it will not easily grow fine. Some follow the rule of beating, down the yeast often white in the tun, and keep it working two or three days; observing to put it into the ves|sel just when the yeast begins to fall. This liquor is very fine: but that quickly put into the vessels will not be very fine for many months.</P>
<P>With respect to the season for brewing liquor to keep, it is to be ob|served, that if the cellars be subject to the heat of the sun, or warm summer air, it will be best to brew in October, that the liquor may have time to digest before the warm season comes on; and if the cellars be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">clinable to damps, and to receive water, the best time will be to brew in March. Some experienced brewers always choose to brew with the pale malt in March, and the brown in October; for they sup|pose, that the pale malt being made with a le's degree of fire than the other, wants the summer sun to ripen it; and so, on the contrary, the brown having had a larger stare of the fire to dry it, is more capable of defending itself against the cold of the winter season. But these are merely matters of opinion.</P>
<P>However careful you have been in attending to all the preceding parti|culars, yet if the case, be not in good order, still the brewing may be spoiled. New cases accept to give liquor a bad taste if they are not well scalded and seasoned several days successively before used. Old tasks, if they stand any time out of use, they will grow musty.</P>
<P>I shall now proceed concerning the management of bottling malt li|quors:&mdash;The bottles must be well cleaned and dried, as wet bottles will turn the beer mouldy, or mothery, and a great deal of good beer spoil|ed thereby. Though the bottles may be clean and dry, yet if the corks be not new and sound, the liquor will be still liable to be damaged; for if the air can get into the bottles the liquor will grow flat, and will never rise. If bottles be corked as they should be, it will be difficult to pull the cork out without a screw, and to draw the cork without breaking, the screw must go through the cork, and then the air will find a passage where the screw has passed, and therefore, a cork once used must be good for nothing. If a cork has once been in a bottle, though it has been drawn with a screw, yet that cork will turn musty as soon as it is exposed to the air, and will communicate its ill flower to the bot|tle in which it be next put, and spoil the liquor that way. In choice of corks, take those that are soft and clear, and free from specks.</P>
<P>Observe, in the bottling of liquor, the top and middle of the hogs|head are the strongest, and will sooner rise in the bottles than the bot|tom. When once you begin to bottle a vessel of any liquor, be sure not to leave it till all be compleated, or it will taste different.</P>
<P>Should a vessel of liquor begin to grow flat whilst in common draught, bottle it, and into each bottle put a piece of loaf sugar, about the size of a walnut, which will rise and bring it to itself; and to forward its ripening, let some bottles in lay in a warm place: but straw will not do.</P>
<P>Where cellars are not good, holes have been sunk in the ground, and large oil jars put into them; the earth must be filled close to the sides, the tops must be covered up close, and they will keep the bottled
<PB N="555" REF="024145_0573_103D73E2A75EB470">
liquor very well. In frosty weather shut off the windows of your cel|lars, and cover them close with horse-dung; but it is better to have no lights or windows in any cellar, for the reasons before given.</P>
<P>If you have an opportunity of brewing a good stock of small beer in March and October, some of it may be bottled at six months end, and put into every bottle a lump of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> sugar.</P>

Oat cakes are made the same way, only use fine sifted oatmeal instead of flour, and two gallons of water instead of three; only this, when you pull them to pieces roll them out with a rolling pin with a good deal of flour, cover them with a piece of flannel, and they will rise to a proper thickness; and if you find them too big, or too little, you must roll dough accordingly.
