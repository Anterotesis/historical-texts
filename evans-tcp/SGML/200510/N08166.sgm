<P>THE Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives of this Province, have appointed you a Committee, to meet at <HI>New-York,</HI> on the fir&s;t Tue&s;day of <HI>October</HI> next&punc; &s;uch Committees as the other Hou&s;es of Repre&s;entatives, or Burge&s;&s;es, in the &s;everal Colonies on this Continent may think fit to appoint, to con|&s;ult together, on the pre&s;ent Circum&s;tances of the Colonies, and the Dif|ficulties to which they are, and mu&s;t be reduced, by the Operation of the late Acts of Parliament. By this Choice, the Hou&s;e has repo&s;ed in you a Tru&s;t of &s;ingular Importance, and has ju&s;t Rea&s;on to expect you will give your utmo&s;t Attention to it. In ca&s;e you &s;hould receive Advice that the Hou&s;es of Repre&s;entatives or Burge&s;&s;es of the other Colonies, or any of them, agree to &s;end Committees to join you in this Intere&s;ting Affair, you are directed to repair to <HI>New-York,</HI> at the Time appointed&punc; and endeavour to unite with them in Sentiment, and agree upon &s;uch Repre&s;entations as may tend to pre&s;erve our Rights and Privileges; and it is the Opinion of this Hou&s;e, that no Addre&s;s or Repre&s;entation, &s;hall be e&s;teemed the Act of this Hou&s;e, unle&s;s it is agreed to, and &s;igned by the major Part of their Committee.</P>
<P>If it &s;hould be &s;aid that we are in any Manner repre&s;ented in Parliament&punc; you mu&s;t by no Means concede to it, as it is an Opinion, which this Hou&s;e cannot &s;ee the lea&s;t Rea&s;on to adopt; further, the Hou&s;e think that &s;uch a Repre&s;entation of the Colonies, as <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Subjects are entitled to, and enjoy, would be attended with the greate&s;t Difficulty, if it is not ab&s;olutely impracticable, and therefore you are not to urge or con&s;ent to any Propo&s;al for a Repre&s;entation, if &s;uch be made in the Congre&s;s.</P>
<P>It is the Expectation of the Hou&s;e, that a mo&s;t loyal and dutiful Address to his Maje&s;ty and his Parliament will be prepared by the Congre&s;s, pray|ing as well for the Removal of the Grievances the Colonies labour under at pre&s;ent, as for the preventing Others for the future, which Petitions, if

<P>It is the hearty Prayer of this Hou&s;e, that the Congre&s;s may be endued with that Wi&s;dom, which is from above; and that their Councils and De|terminations may be attended with the Divine Ble&s;&s;ing.</P>

<P>The Members of this Congre&s;s, &s;incerely devoted, with the warme&s;t Sen|timents of Affection and Duty to his Maje&s;ty's Per&s;on and Government, inviolably attached to the pre&s;ent happy E&s;tabli&s;hment of the Prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;ion, and with Minds deeply impre&s;&s;ed by a Sen&s;e of the pre&s;ent and impending Misfortunes of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Colonies on this Continent; having con&s;idered as maturely as Time will permit, the Circum&s;tances of the &s;aid Colonies, e&s;teem it our indi&s;pen&s;able Duty, to make the following Decla|rations of our humble Opinion, re&s;pecting the mo&s;t E&s;&s;ential Rights and Liberties of the Coloni&s;ts, and of the Grievances under which they labour, by Rea&s;on of &s;everal late Acts of Parliament.</P>
<P N="1">I. That his Maje&s;ty's Subjects in the&s;e Colonies, owe the &s;ame Al|legiance to the Crown of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> that is owing from his Subjects born within the Realm, and all due Subordination to that Augu&s;t Body the Parliament of <HI>Great-Britain.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. That his Maje&s;ty's Liege Subjects in the&s;e Colonies, are entitled to all the inherent Rights and Liberties of his Natural born Subjects, within the Kingdom of <HI>Great-Britain.</HI></P>
<P N="3">III. That it is in&s;eparably e&s;&s;ential to the Freedom of a People, and the undoubted Right of <HI>Engli&s;hmen,</HI> that no Taxes be impo&s;ed on them, but with their own Con&s;ent, given per&s;onally, or by their Repre&s;entatives.</P>
<P N="4">IV. That the People of the&s;e Colonies are not, and from their local Cir|cum&s;tances cannot be, Repre&s;ented in the Hou&s;e of Commons in <HI>Great-Britain.</HI></P>
<P N="5">V. That the only Repre&s;entatives of the People of the&s;e Colonies, are Per|&s;ons cho&s;en therein by them&s;elves, and that no Taxes ever have been, or can be Con&s;titutionally impo&s;ed on them, but by their re&s;pective Legi&s;lature.</P>
<P N="6">VI. That all Supplies to the Crown, being free Gifts of the People, it is unrea&s;onable and incon&s;i&s;tent with the Principles and Spirit of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Con&s;titution, for the People of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> to grant to his Maje&s;ty the Property of the Coloni&s;ts.</P>
<P N="7">VII. That Trial by Jury, is the inherent and invaluable Right of every <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Subject in the&s;e Colonies.</P>
<P N="8"><PB N="16" REF="010424_0016_0FFE630F39B9DCD0">VIII. That the late Act of Parliament, entitled, <HI>An Act for granting and applying certain Stamp Duties, and other Duties, in the</HI> Briti&s;h <HI>Colonies and Plantations in</HI> America, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> by impo&s;ing Taxes on the Inhabitants of the&s;e Colonies, and the &s;aid Act, and &s;everal other Acts, by extending the Ju|ri&s;diction of the Courts of Admiralty beyond its ancient Limits, have a manife&s;t Tendency to &s;ubvert the Rights and Liberties of the Coloni&s;ts.</P>
<P N="9">IX. That the Duties impo&s;ed by &s;everal late Acts of Parliament, from the peculiar Circum&s;tances of the&s;e Colonies, will be extremely Burthen|&s;ome and Grievous; and from the &s;carcity of Specie, the Payment of them ab&s;olutely impracticable.</P>
<P N="10">X. That as the Profits of the Trade of the&s;e Colonies ultimately center in <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> to pay for the Manufactures which they are obliged to take from thence, they eventually contribute very largely to all Supplies granted there to the Crown.</P>
<P N="11">XI. That the Re&s;trictions impo&s;ed by &s;everal late Acts of Parliament, on the Trade of the&s;e Colonies, will render them unable to purcha&s;e the Ma|nufactures of <HI>Great-Britain.</HI></P>
<P N="12">XII. That the Increa&s;e, Pro&s;perity, and Happine&s;s of the&s;e Colonies, depend on the full and free Enjoyment of their Rights and Liberties, and an Intercour&s;e with <HI>Great-Britain</HI> mutually Affectionate and Advantageous.</P>
<P N="13">XIII. That it is the Right of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Subjects in the&s;e Colonies, to Petition the King, or either Hou&s;e of Parliament.</P>
<P><HI>La&s;tly,</HI> That it is the indi&s;pen&s;able Duty of the&s;e Colonies, to the be&s;t of Sovereigns, to the Mother Country, and to them&s;elves, to endeavour by a loyal and dutiful Addre&s;s to his Maje&s;ty, and humble Applications to both Hou&s;es of Parliament, to procure the Repeal of the Act for granting and applying certain Stamp Duties, of all Clau&s;es of any other Acts of Parlia|ment, whereby the Juri&s;diction of the Admiralty is extended as afore&s;aid, and of the other late Acts for the Re&s;triction of <HI>American</HI> Commerce.</P>
<P>Upon Motion, Voted, That <HI>Robert R. Livingston, William Samuel John&s;on,</HI> and <HI>William Murdock,</HI> E&s;quires, be a Committee to prepare an Addre&s;s to his Maje&s;ty, and lay the &s;ame before the Congre&s;s on Monday next.</P>
<P>Voted al&s;o, That <HI>John Rutledge, Edward Tilghman,</HI> and <HI>Philip Livingston,</HI> E&s;quires, be a Committee to prepare a Memorial and Petition to the Lords in Parliament, and lay the &s;ame before the Congre&s;s on Monday next.</P>

<P>THAT the Inhabitants of the&s;e Colonies, Unanimou&s;ly devoted with the warme&s;t Sentiments of Duty and Affection to your Maje&s;ty's Sa|cred Per&s;on and Government, Inviolably attached to the pre&s;ent Happy E&s;tabli&s;hment of the Prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;ion in your Illu&s;trious Hou&s;e, and deeply &s;en&s;ible of your Royal Attention to their Pro&s;perity and Happine&s;s,
<PB N="18" REF="010424_0018_0FFE62A0C6781120">
humbly beg Leave to approach the Throne, by repre&s;enting to your Ma|je&s;ty, That the&s;e Colonies were Originally Planted by Subjects of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Crown, who, animated with the Spirit of Liberty, encouraged by your Maje&s;ty's Royal Predece&s;&s;ors, and confiding in the Public Faith for the En|joyment of all the Rights and Liberties e&s;&s;ential to Freedom, emigrated from their Native Country to this Continent, and by their &s;ucce&s;sful Per|&s;everance in the mid&s;t of innumerable Dangers and Difficulties, together with a Profu&s;ion of their Blood and Trea&s;ure, have happily added the&s;e va&s;t and valuable Dominions to the Empire of <HI>Great-Britain.</HI> That for the Enjoyment of the&s;e Rights and Liberties, &s;everal Governments were early formed in the &s;aid Colonies, with full Power of Legi&s;lation, agreeable to the Principles of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Con&s;titution.</P>
<P>That under tho&s;e Governments, the&s;e Liberties, thus ve&s;ted in their An|ce&s;tors, and tran&s;mitted to their Po&s;terity, have been exerci&s;ed and enjoyed, and by the ine&s;timable Ble&s;&s;ings thereof (under the Favour of Almighty GOD), the inho&s;pitable De&s;arts of <HI>America</HI> have been converted into Flouri&s;hing Countries; Science, Humanity, and the Knowledge of Divine Truths, diffu&s;ed through Remote Regions of Ignorance, Infidelity, and Barbari&s;m; the Number of <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Subjects wonderfully Increa&s;ed, and the Wealth and Power of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> proportionably Augmented.</P>
<P>That by Means of the&s;e Settlements, and the unparallelled Succe&s;s of your Maje&s;ty's Arms, a Foundation is now laid for rendering the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Empire the mo&s;t Exten&s;ive and Powerful of any Recorded in Hi&s;tory. Our Connection with this Empire, we e&s;teem our greate&s;t Happine&s;s and Secu|rity, and humbly conceive it may now be &s;o e&s;tabli&s;hed by your Royal Wi&s;|dom, as to endure to the late&s;t Period of Time; This, with mo&s;t humble Submi&s;&s;ion to your Maje&s;ty, we apprehend will be mo&s;t effectually Accom|pli&s;hed, by fixing the Pillars thereof on Liberty and Ju&s;tice, and &s;ecuring the inherent Rights and Liberties of your Subjects here, upon the Principles of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Con&s;titution. To this Con&s;titution the&s;e Two Principles are e&s;&s;ential, the Right of your faithful Subjects, freely to grant to your Ma|je&s;ty, &s;uch Aids as are required for the Support of your Government over them, and other Public Exigencies, and Trials by their Peers: By the One they are &s;ecured from unrea&s;onable Impo&s;itions; and by the Other from Ar|bitrary Deci&s;ions of the executive Power.</P>
<P>The Continuation of the&s;e Liberties to the Inhabitants of <HI>America</HI> we ardently Implore, as ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to Unite the &s;everal Parts of your wide extended Dominions, in that Harmony &s;o E&s;&s;ential to the Pre&s;ervation and Happine&s;s of the Whole. Protected in the&s;e Liberties, the Emolu|ments <HI>Great-Britain</HI> receives from us, however great at pre&s;ent, are incon|&s;iderable, compared with tho&s;e &s;he has the faire&s;t Pro&s;pect of acquiring.

<P>The invaluable Rights of Taxing our&s;elves, and Trial by our Peers, of which we implore your Maje&s;ty's Protection, are not, we mo&s;t humbly conceive Uncon&s;titutional; but confirmed by the Great CHARTER of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Liberty.

<P><HI>Mo&s;t humbly Sheweth,</HI></P>
<P>THAT the &s;everal late Acts of Parliament impo&s;ing divers Duties and Taxes on the Colonies, and laying the Trade and Commerce thereof under very Burthen&s;ome Re&s;trictions, but above all the Act for granting and applying certain Stamp Duties, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in <HI>America,</HI> have fill'd them with the deepe&s;t Concern and Surprize'; and they humbly conceive the Execution of them will be attended with Con&s;equences very Injurious to the Commercial Intere&s;t of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> and her Colonies, and mu&s;t terminate in the eventual Ruin of the latter.</P>
<P>Your Petitioners therefore mo&s;t ardently implore the Attention of the Honourable Hou&s;e, to the united and dutiful Repre&s;entation of their Cir|cum&s;tances, and to their earne&s;t Supplications for Relief, from tho&s;e Regu|lations which have already involv'd this Continent in Anxiety, Confu&s;ion, and Di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>We mo&s;t &s;incerely recognize our Allegiance to the Crown, and acknow|ledge all due Subordination to the Parliament of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> and &s;hall always retain the mo&s;t grateful Sen&s;e of their A&s;&s;i&s;tance and Protection. It is from and under the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Con&s;titution, we derive all our Civil and Religious Rights and Liberties: We Glory in being Subjects of the be&s;t of Kings, and having been Born under the mo&s;t perfect Form of Government; but it is with mo&s;t ineffable and humiliating Sorrow, that we find our&s;elves, of late, deprived of the Right of Granting our own Property for his Ma|je&s;ty's
<PB N="22" REF="010424_0022_0FFE752FD4F66CB0">
Service, to which our Lives and Fortunes are entirely devoted, and to which, on his Royal Requi&s;itions, we leave ever been ready to contribute to the utmo&s;t of our Abilities.</P>
<P>We have al&s;o the Misfortune to find, that all the Penalties and Forfei|tures mentioned in the Stamp Act, and in divers late Acts of Trade extend|ing to the Plantations, are, at the Election of the Informer, Recoverable in any Court of Admiralty in <HI>America.</HI> This, as the newly erected Court of Admiralty has a general Juri&s;diction over all <HI>Briti&s;h America,</HI> renders his Maje&s;ty's Subjects in the&s;e Colonies, liable to be carried, at an immense Expence, from one End of the Continent, to the other.</P>
<P>It gives us al&s;o great Pain, to &s;ee a manife&s;t Di&s;tinction made therein, between the Subjects of our Mother Country, and tho&s;e in the Colonies, in that the like Penalties and Forfeitures recoverable there only in his Ma|je&s;ty's Courts of Record, are made cognizable here by a Court of Admiralty: By the&s;e Means we &s;eem to be, in Effect, unhappily deprived of Two Pri|vileges e&s;&s;ential to Freedom, and which all <HI>Engli&s;hmen</HI> have ever con&s;idered as their be&s;t Birthrights, that of being free from all Taxes but &s;uch as they have con&s;ented to in Per&s;on, or by their Repre&s;entatives, and of Trial by their Peers.</P>
<P>Your Petitioners further &s;hew, That the remote Situation, and other Circum&s;tances of the Colonies, render it impracticable that they &s;hould be Repre&s;ented, but in their re&s;pective &s;ubordinate Legi&s;lature; and they hum|bly conceive, that the Parliament, adhering &s;trictly to the Principles of the Con&s;titution, have never hitherto Tax'd any, but tho&s;e who were actually therein Repre&s;ented; for this Rea&s;on, we humbly apprehend, they never have Tax'd <HI>Ireland,</HI> or any other of the Subjects without the Realm.</P>
<P>But were it ever &s;o clear, that the Colonies might in Law, be rea&s;onably deem'd to be Repre&s;ented in the Honourable Hou&s;e of Commons, yet we conceive, that very good Rea&s;ons, from Inconvenience, from the Principles of true Policy, and from the Spirit of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Con&s;titution, may be ad|duced to &s;hew, that it would be for the real Intere&s;t of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> as well as her Colonies, that the late Regulations &s;hould be re&s;cinded, and the &s;everal Acts of Parliament impo&s;ing Duties and Taxes on the Colonies, and extending the Juri&s;diction of the Courts of Admiralty here, beyond their ancient Limits, &s;hould be Repeal'd.</P>
<P>We &s;hall not Attempt a minute Detail of all the Rea&s;ons which the Wi&s;|dom of the Honourable Hou&s;e may &s;ugge&s;t, on this Occa&s;ion, but would humbly &s;ubmit the following Particulars to their Con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>That Money is already become very &s;carce in the&s;e Colonies, and is still decrea&s;ing by the nece&s;&s;ary Exportation of Specie from the Continent, for the Di&s;charge of our Debts to <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Merchants.</P>
<P>That immensely heavy Debt is yet due from the Colonies for British Manufactures, and that they are still heavily burthen'd with <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 words"> dis|charge the Arrearages due for Aide granted by them in the late War.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="010424_0023_0FFE75388E520BD0">That the Balance of Trade will ever be much again&s;t the Colonies, and in <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> whil&s;t we con&s;ume her Manufactures, the De|mand for which mu&s;t ever Increa&s;e in Proportion to the Number of Inha|bitants &s;ettled here, with the Means of Purcha&s;ing them. We therefore humbly conceive it to be the Intere&s;t of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> to increa&s;e, rather that dimini&s;h, tho&s;e Means, as the Profits of all the Trade of the Colonies ultimately center there to pay for her Manufactures, as we are not allowed to purcha&s;e el&s;ewhere; and by the Con&s;umption of which, at the advanced Prices the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Taxes oblige the Makers and Venders to &s;et on them, we eventually contribute very largely to the Revenue of the Crown.</P>
<P>That from the Nature of <HI>American</HI> Bu&s;ine&s;s, the Multiplicity of Suits and Papers u&s;ed in Matters of &s;mall Value, in a Country where Freeholds are &s;o minutely divided, and Property &s;o frequently tran&s;ferr'd, a Stamp Duty mu&s;t ever be very Burthen&s;ome and Unequal.</P>
<P>That it is extremely improbable that the Honourable Hou&s;e of Commons, &s;hou'd at all Times, be thoroughly acquainted with our Condition, and all Facts requi&s;ite to a ju&s;t and equal Taxation of the Colonies.</P>
<P>It is al&s;o humbly &s;ubmitted, Whether there be not a material Di&s;tinction in Rea&s;on and &s;ound Policy, at lea&s;t, between the nece&s;&s;ary Exerci&s;e of Par|liamentary Juri&s;diction in general Acts, for the Amendment of the Common Law, and the Regulation of Trade and Commerce through the whole Em|pire, and the Exerci&s;e of that Juri&s;diction, by impo&s;ing Taxes on the Colonies.</P>
<P>That the &s;everal &s;ubordinate Provincial Legi&s;latures have been moulded into Forms, as nearly re&s;embling that of their Mother Country, as by his Maje&s;ty's Royal Predece&s;&s;ors was thought convenient; and their Legi&s;latures &s;eem to have been wi&s;ely and graciou&s;ly e&s;tabli&s;hed, that the Subjects in the Colonies might, under the due Admini&s;tration thereof, enjoy the happy Fruits of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Government, which in their pre&s;ent Circum&s;tances, they cannot be &s;o fully and clearly availed of, any other Way under the&s;e Forms of Government we and our Ance&s;tors have been Born or Settled, and have had our Lives, Liberties, and Properties, protected. The People here, as every where el&s;e, retain a great Fondne&s;s for their old Cu&s;toms and U&s;ages, and we tru&s;t that his Maje&s;ty's Service, and the Intere&s;t of the Na|tion, &s;o far from being ob&s;tructed, have been va&s;tly promoted by the Pro|vincial Legi&s;latures.</P>
<P>That we e&s;teem our Connections with, and Dependance on <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> as one of our greate&s;t Ble&s;&s;ings, and apprehend the latter will appear to be &s;ufficiently &s;ecure, when it is con&s;idered, that the Inhabitants in the Colo|nies have the mo&s;t unbounded Affection for his Maje&s;ty's Per&s;on, Family, and Government, as well as for the Mother Country, and that their Subor|dination to the Parliament, is univer&s;ally acknowledged.</P>
<P>We therefore mo&s;t humbly entreat, That the Honourable Hou&s;e would be plea&s;ed to hear our Coun&s;el in Support of this Petition, and take our di&s;tre&s;&s;ed and deplorable Ca&s;e into their &s;erious Con&s;ideration, and that the

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WE had the Honour to be appointed by the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives of the Province of <HI>Maryland,</HI> a Committee, to meet Committees of the Members of A&s;&s;embly of the other Colonies, on this Continent, at <HI>New-York,</HI> the Fir&s;t of this In&s;tant, to join in a general, and united, duti|ful, loyal, and humble Repre&s;entation of the Condition of tho&s;e Colonies, to his Maje&s;ty and the Parliament, and to implore Relief from the grievous Burthens lately laid upon our Trade, and the Taxes and Duties lately im|po&s;ed on us, e&s;pecially by the STAMP-ACT.</P>
<P>Accordingly Members from Nine Colonies met, <HI>to wit,</HI> from the <HI>Ma&s;|&s;achu&s;etts-Bay, Connecticut, Rhode-I&s;land</HI> and <HI>Providence</HI> Plantations&punc; <HI>New-York, New-Jer&s;ey, Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> the Government of the Counties of <HI>New-Ca&s;tle, Kent,</HI> and <HI>Su&s;&s;ex,</HI> upon <HI>Delaware, Maryland,</HI> and <HI>South-Carolina,</HI> but
<PB N="27" REF="010424_0027_0FFE7557F41FEEE0">
as you'll find the Addre&s;s, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Signed only by Members from Six of tho&s;e Colonies, it may be proper to acquaint you with the Rea&s;ons why they did not all Sign, tho' they all concurr'd with the Proceedings.</P>
<P>The Lieutenant Governor of <HI>New-York</HI> Prorogued their A&s;&s;embly from Time to Time, &s;o that their Hou&s;e had not an Opportunity of appointing Members with full Powers to join, and Sign the Addre&s;s, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Yet the A&s;&s;embly of <HI>New-York,</HI> having at their la&s;t Meeting, appointed Five of their Members as a Committee, not only to Corre&s;pond with their Agent at Home, but al&s;o during the Rece&s;s of the Hou&s;e, to write to, and corre&s;|pond with, the &s;everal A&s;&s;emblies, or Committees of A&s;&s;emblies on this Continent, on the &s;ubject Matter of the &s;everal late Acts of Parliament, &s;o Grievous and Dangerous to their Colonies, it was thought proper to admit this Committee to join in the Conferences, and they agreed to what was done, and promi&s;ed to u&s;e their Endeavours with their A&s;&s;embly to concur al&s;o whenever they &s;hould be permitted to meet.</P>
<P>The <HI>South-Carolina</HI> A&s;&s;embly, not rightly viewing the Propo&s;al (which Originally came from the A&s;&s;embly of the Government of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay,</HI>) as it was intended that the &s;everal Committees, when met, &s;hould Frame and Sign an Addre&s;s to his Maje&s;ty, and Memorial and Petition to the Parliament, to be immediately Di&s;patch'd by the Congre&s;s, In&s;tructed their Members (Messrs. <HI>Lynch, Rutledge,</HI> and <HI>Gadsden,</HI>) to return their Pro|ceedings to them, for Approbation. The <HI>Connecticut</HI> A&s;&s;embly made the &s;ame Re&s;trictions in their In&s;tructions. The A&s;&s;embly al&s;o of <HI>New-Hamp|&s;hire</HI> wrote, that they had Re&s;olved, That notwith&s;tanding they were Sen&s;i|ble &s;uch a Repre&s;entation ought to be made, and approved of the propo&s;ed Method for obtaining thereof, yet the pre&s;ent Situation of their Govern|mental Affairs, wou'd not permit them to appoint a Committee to attend &s;uch Meeting, but &s;hou'd be ready to join in any Addre&s;s to his Maje&s;ty and the Parliament they might be honoured with the Knowledge of, probable to an&s;wer the propo&s;ed End: And the Speaker of the A&s;&s;embly of <HI>Georgia</HI> wrote, that a Majority of their Members had applied to the Governor to call their A&s;&s;embly, and he did not think it Expedient, which was the Rea|&s;on they did not &s;end a Committee as propo&s;ed, but reque&s;ted us to tran&s;mit a Copy of our Proceedings to them (which will be done) and that their A&s;&s;embly wou'd meet about this Time, and he did not doubt but they &s;hou'd Act &s;o as to convince the Si&s;ter Colonies of their inviolable Attach|ment to the Common Cau&s;e: We al&s;o under&s;tood the <HI>North-Carolina,</HI> and we know the <HI>Virginia</HI> A&s;&s;embly, was Prorogued, whereby they cou'd not have the Opportunity of joining us; &s;o that we doubt not but the Colonies who have not Signed, will very &s;peedily tran&s;mit &s;imilar Addre&s;&s;es, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> if their A&s;&s;emblies &s;hould not be hindered from Meeting: And to this Pur|po&s;e, we hope you'll &s;oon hear from the A&s;&s;embly of <HI>South-Carolina.</HI> By the Gentlemen of that Colony we were favoured with a Sight of your late Letters, and inform'd of your careful and &s;pirited Conduct with Regard to the Intere&s;ts of that Colony, and that, together with your Declaration, which we find in tho&s;e Letters, that you enjoy an independant Seat in the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Parliament, induced us (as we have no e&s;tabli&s;hed Agent at pre&s;ent. for this Province, nor have yet been able to obtain a Law to Tax our&s;elves
<PB N="28" REF="010424_0028_0FFE755C0A0C1138">
for that Purpo&s;e) to trouble you with our Reque&s;t, that you will Pre&s;ent the inclo&s;ed Addre&s;s to his Maje&s;ty, and Memorial and Petition to the Hou&s;es of Parliament, and exert your utmo&s;t Intere&s;t and Abilities in behalf of this poor di&s;tre&s;s'd Country, and of this Province in particular.</P>
<P>We hope as there is a Change in the Mini&s;try, and as the Gentlemen in the Hou&s;e of Commons, may at their next Meeting, take a more enlarged View of the true Intere&s;t of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> and her Colonies, they will find it to be in &s;upporting the Rights and encouraging the Trade of the lat|ter, and that the Happine&s;s of the Mother Country and her Colonies mu&s;t be in&s;eparable, and that we &s;hall obtain Relief.</P>
<P>The &s;everal Committees agreed to recommend it to their re&s;pective Colo|nies to appoint Special Agents on this Occa&s;ion, and to in&s;truct them to unite their utmo&s;t Intere&s;t and Endeavours for that Purpo&s;e. One Ad|dre&s;s, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> was tran&s;mitted by the Gentlemen of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts</HI> Govern|ment, immediately to their Agent (Mr. <HI>Jack&s;on</HI> we under&s;tood) and we expect the other Colonies will have Duplicates &s;ent to their Agents, and we hope will all unite in Expence and In&s;tructions, to have able Coun&s;el before both the Lords and Commons, as our Petitions pray.</P>
<P>We were intru&s;ted with the Di&s;po&s;ition of &s;ome Money upon this Occa|&s;ion, and inclo&s;e you a Bill of Exchange, on Me&s;&s;rs. <HI>Capel</HI> and <HI>O&s;good Han|bury,</HI> for One Hundred and Fifty Pounds Sterling, as a Compen&s;ation for your Trouble and Expence in this Affair. We doubt not our A&s;&s;embly will approve of what we do in this Matter; and as they are to meet the la&s;t of this Month, we &s;hall lay our Proceedings before them, and 'tis probable they will write you more fully, and furni&s;h you with &s;uch further In&s;truc|tions and Arguments, as may appear to them to be proper to be given and urged on this Occa&s;ion, in Behalf of the Colonies.</P>
