<P>I Bring you this Day, a Text of Sacred Scrip|ture, which a Faithful Servant of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, lately gone unto Him, did before his going, order for you, as his <HI>Legacy.</HI> Give your Attention.</P>

<P>THat Holy, and Worthy Mini&s;ter of the Go&s;pel, who&s;e <HI>Funeral</HI> is this Day to be attended, having Long Laboured for the Conver|&s;ion of men unto God, at length grew very <HI>Prae&s;agious</HI> that his Labours in the E|vangelical Mini&s;try, drew near unto an End.

His <HI>Life</HI> had all this while, been a <HI>Practical Commentary</HI> upon his <HI>Doctrine</HI>; and now, behold! His <HI>Death</HI> mu&s;t Expound and Apply the <HI>Doctrine,</HI> which he would have Preached unto us. He mu&s;t &s;how us, how to do that Important work of <HI>Committing a Departing Spirit into the Hands of God,</HI> no otherwi&s;e than by the Actual doing of that work him&s;elf. While therefore he Lay a Dying, he a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">k'd one of his deare&s;t Relations, <HI>Do&s;t thou know what I am doing!</HI> She &s;aid, <HI>No</HI>; He then added, <HI>I am Rendring, I am Rendring!</HI> mea|ning, I &s;uppo&s;e, his own <HI>Spirit</HI> unto the Lord. But while he was doing of that work, and with Humble Re&s;ignation <HI>Committing his own Spirit into the Hands of God,</HI> he de&s;ired of me, that I would Preach upon the Text, about which he had been under &s;uch Intentions. Where|fore [If at lea&s;t I may be thought worthy of &s;uch a Character!] You are now to con&s;ider me, &s;hall I &s;ay, as <HI>Executing the Will of the Dead?</HI> or, as <HI>Repre&s;enting a Man of God, whom God hath taken.</HI> The <HI>Truths,</HI> which we &s;hall now Incul|cate, wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l be &s;uch, as you are all along to think, <HI>The&s;e are the Things which a Saint now in Glory

<P>Our <HI>P&s;almi&s;t,</HI> the Illu&s;trious <HI>David,</HI> now, as we may judge, drew near unto his End: and we may &s;ay of the <HI>P&s;alm</HI> here compo&s;ed by him, <HI>The&s;e are among the la&s;t words of David, the man who was Rai&s;ed up on High.</HI> The <HI>Sighs</HI> of the P&s;almi&s;t here collected, &s;eem to have been occa&s;ion'd, by the <HI>Sufferings,</HI> which he under|went, when his own Subjects, took up Arms a|gain&s;t him.

In <HI>Committing our Spirits unto God,</HI> our Lord <HI>Christ</HI> is to be di&s;tinctly con&s;idered; and He was, no doubt, by <HI>David</HI> con&s;idered.

<P>There was indeed a wonderful <HI>Time,</HI> when our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t Him&s;elf made a wonder|ful <HI>U&s;e</HI> of this very Text.

<P>And now, there is a weighty CASE, that lies before us;</P>
<P>After what manner &s;hould we commit our Spirits unto our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, that &s;o the Eternal Safety and Welfare of our Spirits, may be effectu|ally provided for?</P>
<P>If our Faithful BAILY were now <HI>Alive,</HI> I do not know any one CASE, that he would more <HI>Livelily</HI> have di&s;cour&s;ed among you: but I know, that he would have Di&s;cou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ed on This, with a <HI>Soul</HI> full of Inexpre&s;&s;ible Ago|nies. He was a <HI>Man,</HI> who had, from a <HI>Child,</HI> been full of Sollicitous <HI>Cares</HI> about his own <HI>Soul</HI>; and from hence in part it was, that when he became a <HI>Preacher</HI> of the Go&s;pel, he <HI>Preach'd</HI> nothing &s;o much, as the <HI>Cares</HI> that all men &s;hould have, about the <HI>Conver&s;ion</HI> of their <HI>Souls,</HI> unto God, and the <HI>Sincerity</HI> of their <HI>Souls</HI> before Him. There were many Great Points of our <HI>Chri&s;tian Faith,</HI> which he &s;till treated with Shorter Tou|ches, becau&s;e his Thoughts were continually Swallow'd up, with the <HI>Vast Concern</HI> of not being <HI>Deceived,</HI> about the <HI>Marks</HI> of a Rege|nerate and a Sanctifyed <HI>Soul,</HI> and <HI>Hopes</HI> of being <HI>found in Chri&s;t</HI> at a Dying Hour. Tho&s;e two words, A SOUL, and ETERNITY, were <HI>Great Words</HI> unto him; and his very <HI>Soul</HI> was
<PB N="9" REF="000828_0009_0FAB4041E80237D0">
greatly, and alwayes under the Awe of them. Hence, The very <HI>Spirit</HI> of his Preaching, lay in the points, of <HI>Turning</HI> from Sin to God in Chri&s;t, and the <HI>Trial</HI> of our doing &s;o, and the <HI>Peril</HI> of our not doing it.

<P>The <HI>De&s;ire</HI> of this <HI>Holy</HI> man, was, (as him|&s;elf Expre&s;&s;ed it,) to Get up unto <HI>Three</HI> Things: To <HI>Patience</HI> under the <HI>Calamities</HI> of Life; To <HI>Impatience</HI> under the <HI>Infirmities</HI> of Life; and, To earne&s;t Longings for the <HI>Next Life.</HI></P>

<P>From this Holy Temper it was, that when &s;ome kind pre&s;ents were made unto him, he wrote in his <HI>Diary</HI> thereupon; <HI>I have my wages quickly; But Oh! that God may not put we off,

<P>We will more particularly Note, a few No|tables, wherein the <HI>Holine&s;s,</HI> which Irradiated him, will be de&s;cribed unto us.</P>
<P>We might begin, with Ob&s;erving, That the <HI>Holy Word</HI> of God was very dear to him, as in|deed it is to every <HI>Holy man.</HI> Hence, I find this pa&s;&s;age in his <HI>Diary. Jan.</HI> 11.
<Q><HI>I fini&s;hed the Reading of the Bible,</HI> in my Family (as for|merly,) Oh! it's a <HI>Dear</HI> Book; it's alwayes <HI>New.</HI> In the <HI>Beginning</HI> of every Chapter, it's good to &s;ay, <HI>Lord, open my Eyes, that I may &s;ee Wonders out of thy Law</HI>; And when we &s;hut it up, to &s;ay, <HI>I have &s;een an end of all perfection, but thy Law is exceeding Broad.</HI> Oh! now terrible are the <HI>Threatenings</HI>; how precious are the <HI>Promi&s;es</HI>; how &s;erious are the <HI>Precepts</HI>; how deep are the <HI>Prophecies</HI> of this Book!</Q>
But we will pa&s;s on, to &s;ome further Ob&s;ervations.</P>
<P>What is <HI>Holine&s;s,</HI> but a <HI>Dedication</HI> to the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t? This Holy man was often brea|thing in him&s;elf, and pre&s;&s;ing on others, that Great point, of <HI>Dedicating</HI> every thing to the Service of the Lord. Thus, in his <HI>Diary</HI> there frequently occur, &s;uch Strains as the&s;e.
<Q>Oh! that I may <HI>Glorify God,</HI> with all I <HI>am,</HI> or have; even with all the faculties of my <HI>Soul,</HI> all the members of my <HI>Body,</HI> and in all the <HI>Places</HI> and <HI>Relations</HI> that I Stand in, as <HI>Man, Ma&s;ter, Mini|&s;ter,

Husband, Kin&s;man, &amp; Neighbour.</HI> Oh! I &s;tand in need both of a <HI>Ju&s;tifying</HI> Chri&s;t, and a <HI>Sanctifying</HI> Chri&s;t. When &s;hall I &s;en&s;ibly find a Chri&s;t, Swaying his Scepter in my Soul!</Q>
Thus, whatever <HI>Hou&s;e</HI> he came to Live in, it came under a <HI>Dedication</HI>; and once upon a Re|move, he wrote this pa&s;&s;age in his Diary.
<Q>I could not but Leave my <HI>Old Hou&s;e,</HI> with a Prayer in <HI>every Room</HI> of it, for pardoning mercy.</Q></P>
<P>But it was particularly Expre&s;&s;ed, when one of his <HI>Children</HI> was to be <HI>Bapti&s;ed.</HI> He thus wrote upon it.
<Q>I &s;pent &s;ome Time, in Offer|ing up my &s;elf, and my <HI>Child</HI> unto the Lord, and in taking hold of the <HI>Covenant</HI> for my &s;elf and him. It is Actually to be done to mor|row, [in Bapti&s;m.] I prayed hard this day, all this day, that I might be able in much Faith, and Love, and New-Covenant-Obedience, to do it to morrow. It is not <HI>Ea&s;y,</HI> tho' <HI>Common,</HI> to offer a Child unto God in <HI>Bapti&s;m.</HI> Oh! that's a &s;weet word, <HI>I will be a God to Thee, and thy Seed after thee.</HI> No marvel <HI>Abraham</HI> fell on his Face at the hearing of it!</Q></P>
<P>Hence, when he parted with the greate&s;t En|joyment he had in this World, he thus wrote upon it, in his Diary;</P>
<P><Q>If I can but Exchange <HI>Outward Comforts</HI> for <HI>Inward Graces,</HI> 'tis well enough: Oh! for an Heart to <HI>Glorify God in the Fire</HI>!</Q></P>

<P>At another Time.</P>
<P><Q>I &s;poke Two <HI>unadvi&s;ed words</HI> to day. Tho' there was no great Harm in them, yet I was Rebuked by my Con&s;cience for them.

<P>At another Time.</P>
<P><Q>That's a &s;erious word, methinks, in Eph. 5.30.

<P><Q>This Day I have been more chearful, than I

<P><Q>I de&s;ired to know of Dr. <HI>O.</HI> what I was in|debted to him, for tho&s;e many Rich Things I have had from him: he told me, <HI>Nothing</HI>; [which was a great Favour!] only de&s;ired my <HI>Prayers</HI> for him.

But then there is ano<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">her Que&s;tion, hence proper to be Con&s;idered: <HI>What is a CHRISTIAN?</HI> And it is to be feared, That very many, who wear that <HI>Worthy Name,</HI> can make, either but a &s;orry An&s;wer to that Que&s;tion, or &s;uch an An&s;wer as mu&s;t carry their own Confu|tation, and Condemnation in it.</P>

<P>The Go&s;pel of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, was begun to be Preached unto the <HI>Gentiles: Anti|och</HI> particularly was a City of the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> where the Preaching of the Go&s;pel was Crowned with a great Succe&s;s. And at this <HI>Antioch</HI> it was, that the Name of CHRISTIANS, was fir&s;t put upon the people, who <HI>Received the Love of the Truth</HI> of that Go&s;pel.

<P>We have Two Things here before us, that &s;eem Remarkable.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="000828_0060_0FAB415D6BA6F510">Fir&s;t, We have the <HI>Name,</HI> which was betimes fa&s;tned upon the <HI>Di&s;ciples</HI> of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t. This Ble&s;&s;ed people, had hitherto cal|led one another, by the Name of <HI>Di&s;ciples,</HI> be|cau&s;e of their &s;ubjection to the In&s;truction, and Protection, and Government, of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t.

Their Enemies all this while, called them <HI>Nazarenes,</HI> and <HI>Galilaeans,</HI> becau&s;e our Lord was Conceived, and had Re|&s;ided at <HI>Nazareth</HI> in <HI>Galilee</HI>; and His Apo&s;tles were mo&s;tly of that Countrey. But now, the Honourable Name of CHRISTIANS, became <HI>That,</HI> by which they were afterwards mo&s;t of all di&s;tingui&s;hed.</P>
<P>Secondly, We have the <HI>Place,</HI> where this Ve|nerable Name fir&s;t of all began.

<P>Fir&s;t, Who it was that fir&s;t gave the Name of CHRISTIANS, to the <HI>Di&s;ciples</HI> of our Lord?

It is much more probable, That the <HI>Di&s;ciples</HI> A&s;&s;umed this Name to them&s;elves, by their own Election The Greek word, <HI>CHREMATISAI,</HI> here u&s;ed, for <HI>Called,</HI> &s;ignifies, a <HI>Calling,</HI> with &s;ome very &s;olemn and &s;ignal, and &s;ingular Circum&s;tances.

It &s;hould &s;eem, that there was a &s;pecial Directi|on, from the Holy Spirit of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> unto them, for their doing of it.</P>
<P>Secondly. Why the Name of CHRISTIANS; A Title derived from no per&s;on in the Trinity, but the <HI>Second</HI>; and from no other Character of that Second Per&s;on, but <HI>This?</HI></P>
<P>Of That I &s;ay; 'Tis only the <HI>Second Per&s;on</HI> in the Trinity, which took our <HI>Nature</HI> upon Him. Our <HI>Name</HI> therefore is very fitly fetch'd from that Second Per&s;on.

men, whereby we mu&s;t be Saved,</HI> it is not fit that this <HI>Name</HI> &s;hould be put upon any <HI>among men under Heaven.</HI> They who have call'd them|&s;elves JESUITES, in the La&s;t Age, are a <HI>pre|&s;umptuous</HI> as well as a <HI>pernicious</HI> Generation.

<P>Having thus briefly di&s;patched the&s;e <HI>Two</HI> En|quiries, there is a <HI>Third,</HI> which remains, to be the Subject of our further, and mo&s;t &s;erious Meditations. Namely;</P>
<P><HI>What is a CHRISTIAN?</HI></P>
<P>Two <HI>Preliminaries</HI> are to be Con&s;idered.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t; Many a man is not <HI>Really</HI> a <HI>Chri&s;tian,</HI> that yet is <HI>Vi&s;ibly</HI> &s;o. As the Scripture &s;ayes, in Rom. 2.28. <HI>He is not a Jew, that is one outwardly</HI>: Thus we may &s;ay, <HI>He is not a Chri&s;tian, that is no more than outwardly &s;o.</HI> Tis t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e, A mans being <HI>Vi&s;ibly</HI> a <HI>Chri&s;tian,</HI> is that which Entitles him to the External Priviledges of <HI>Christianity,</HI> in the Churches of God; <HI>Non Judicat Eccle&s;ia de Oc|cultis.</HI> But a man mu&s;t be <HI>Really</HI> a <HI>Christian,</HI> if he would not peri&s;h among <HI>Infidels</HI> at the la&s;t.</P>
<P>Secondly; A man that is <HI>Really</HI> a <HI>Chri&s;tian,</HI> may have many <HI>&V;nchri&s;tian</HI> Di&s;orders in his Heart &amp; Walk. Alas, my Friend&punc; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> is not <HI>Chri&s;tianity,</HI> that is done by every <HI>Real Chri&s;tian</HI>! He was a <HI>Real</HI> and a <HI>First-rate Christian,</HI> who &s;aid, in Rom. 7.22, 23. <HI>I Delight in the Law of God after the Inward man, but I &s;ee another

<P>Prepared with the&s;e Two Con&s;ideration, Let us now pa&s;s on to Con&s;ider, What a <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> is? What are the points of <HI>Real Chri&s;tianity,</HI> which every <HI>Christian,</HI> as far as he is a <HI>Chri&s;tian,</HI> does come up unto.</P>
<P>Give your Attention, Sirs; Your Condition for Eternity, is going to be determined.</P>
