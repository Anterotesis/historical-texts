<HEAD>Proclamation. BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.</HEAD>
<P>WHEREAS it appears, that a state of War exists between Austria, Prussia, Sardinia, Great-Britain, and the United Netherlands, of the one part; and France on the other, and the duty and interest of the United States require, that they should, with sincerity and good faith, adopt and pursue a conduct friendly and impartial towards the Belligerent Powers:</P>
<P>I HAVE THEREFORE THOUGHT FIT by these presents, to de|clare the disposition of the United States to observe the conduct aforesaid towards these Powers respectively; and to exhort and warn the citizens of the United States carefully to avoid all acts and proceedings whatsoever, which may in any manner tend to contravene such disposition.</P>
<P>And I do hereby also make known, that whosoever of the citizens of the United States shall render himself liable to punishment or forfeiture under the Law of Nations, by committing, aiding or abetting hostilities against any of the said Powers, or by carrying to any of them those articles, which are deemed contraband by the MODERN usage of nations, will not receive the protection of the United States, against such punishment or forfeitures; and further, that I have given instruments to those Officers, to whom it belongs, to cause prosecutions to be instituted against all persons, who shall, within the cognizance of the courts of the United States, violate the Law of Na|tions, with respect to the Powers at War, or any of them.</P>
<P>In Testimony whereof, I have caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed to these presents, and signed the same with my hand. Done at the City of Philadelphia, the twenty-second day of April, one thousand seven hundred and ninety-three, and of the Independence of the United States of America, the seventeenth.</P>
