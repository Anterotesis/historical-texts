<P>WHEREAS I have thought fit, by and with the Advice and Con&s;ent of His Maje&s;ties Council for the Province of <HI>New-York,</HI> to call a General A&s;&s;embly, and being informed, That by &s;ome Unlawful and Indirect Cour&s;es, the People have been heretofore Interrupted in their Freedom of Elections of their Repre&s;entatives. And being re&s;olved That for the future His Maje&s;ties Subjects of this Province &s;hould not be mole&s;ted in the Free|dom of their Choice of A&s;&s;embly-Men, but that the &s;ame &s;hould be regularly done, according to the Laws of <HI>England,</HI> and this Province. I do therefore &s;trictly Require and Command all Sheriffs, Ju&s;tices of the Peace, and other Officers whom the&s;e Pre&s;ents may Concern, That they in their Re&s;pective Stations do take effectual Care that there be a Free and Fair Election of Members for the en&s;uing A&s;&s;embly. And that timely Notice be given to the Free-holders in each re&s;pective City and County within this Province, to prevent any the like Unlawful and Indirect Practices in the &s;aid Elections, as they will an&s;wer the Contrary at their utmo&s;t Perils, as Enemies to his Maje&s;ties Government, and the Peace and Pro&s;perity of this Province.</P>
