<OPENER><SALUTE>Gentlemen;</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>MY Voyage hither from <HI>England</HI> was very tedious, and attended with great Hard&s;hips; but &s;ince my being among you I have endeavoured to redeem that lo&s;s of Time, by applying my &s;elf diligently to the Publick bu&s;ine&s;s, in Duty to His Maje&s;ty, and that I might be the better enabled to &s;erve you.</P>
<P>I cannot but ob&s;erve to you what a Legacy my Predece&s;&s;or has left me, and what Difficulties to &s;trugle with, A Divided People, an Empty Trea&s;ury; a few mi&s;erable, naked half-&s;tarv'd Souldiers, not half the Number the King allow'd pay for; the Fortifications, and even the Governours Hou&s;e
<PB N="2" REF="000849_0002_0FABA1449576D7B0">
very much out of Repair; and in a word, <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> the whole Government out of Frame. To you therefore I recommend the con&s;ideration of tho&s;e Di&s;orders, as be&s;t becoming your Prudence to apply the proper Remedies, and you may be &s;ure of my hearty Concurrence in every thing that will conduce to the extingui&s;hing tho&s;e Heats and Annimo&s;ities among you, which I fear have been of late years indu&s;triou&s;ly cheri&s;h't and fomented, and to the the curing all the other Di&s;orders and Mi&s;chiefs among you.</P>
<P>It hath b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">n repre&s;ented to the Government in <HI>England</HI>&punc; That th is rovince hath been a noted Receptacle of Pyrates, and the Trade of it under no Re&s;triction, but the Acts of Trade violated, by the Neglect and Connivance of tho&s;e who&s;e Duty it was to have prevented it. I hope <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> you will put all the Di&s;countenance imaginable on that flagacious Crime of <HI>Pyracy,</HI> which is not only the wor&s;t &s;ort of Robbery, but is, for the mo&s;t part attended with the horrid Sin of Murder, which is a great aggravation of that odious Practice, dete&s;ted by all the Civil Nations of the World. 'Tis not only injurious to the Honour of his Maje&s;ty, and the Engli&s;h Nation, but al&s;o highly prejudicial to the Trade of <HI>England,</HI> and par|ticularly to the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Company. And the Gentlemen of the Council here pre&s;ent will bear me witne&s;s, that my Orders from his Maje&s;ty are very &s;trict for enquiring into, and effectually preventing for the future that Lawle&s;s and Vile Trade of Pyracy within all my Government.</P>
<P>As I have declared my &s;elf again&s;t Pyracy, and all Unlawful Trade&punc; &s;o I mu&s;t a&s;&s;ure you I will giv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> you all the Encouragement I can po&s;&s;ibly in carrying on a lawful Tra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">, and every thing el&s;e that will make you Happy and Flouri&s;hing.</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Speaker and you Gentlemen Repre&s;entatives;</HI></P>
<P>I Hope you will take into your Con&s;ideration, That the Revenue is near expiring, and that you will provide for the Support of the Government for the time to come; and therein give me leave to put you in mind, that your Duty and Re&s;pect to his Maje&s;ty &s;hould be an agrument to you, no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to leave the Government de&s;titute. It would be hard, if I that come among you with an hone&s;t mind, and a Re&s;olution to be ju&s;t to your Intere&s;t, &s;hould meet with greater Difficulties in the di&s;charge of his Maje&s;ties Service than tho&s;e that have gone before me. I will take care there &s;hall be no Mi&s; application of the Publick Money: I will Pocket none of it my &s;elf, nor &s;hall there be any <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mbezilment by others, but exact Accounts &s;hall be given you, when and as often as you &s;hall require.</P>
<P>I have ordered all the Accounts to be laid before you, that you may &s;ee the &s;tate of the Debts of the Government, and take &s;uch cou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e for the Di&s;charge of them as you &s;hall think fit. I wi&s;h too you would con&s;ider how to re&s;tore Credit to the Government, which I under&s;tand is now very low, if not wholly lo&s;t.</P>
<P>I have ordered the Engineer to go and vi&s;it the Fronteers, and to report to me the State and Condition he finds the Fortifications in, which Report I intend for you, as &s;oon as it comes to my hands.</P>
<P><HI>Gentlemen,</HI> I mu&s;t remind you of the Nece&s;&s;ity there is of finding out &s;ome Expedient to reconcile the Parties among you, I mu&s;t own to you, I &s;et

Union among&s;t a People is the Bound of Peace, and of &s;trength too.</P>
<P>You cannot but know what Abu&s;es have been formerly in Elections of Members to &s;erve in the A&s;&s;embly, which tends much to the Subver&s;ion of your Liberties. I do therefore recommend to you the making a Law to provide again&s;t it, and that you will think of &s;uch other Laws as you will &s;tand in need of to &s;ecure to this Province a la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ting Happine&s;s, to which I promi&s;e you my Concurrence.</P>
<P>I &s;hall conclude <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> with recommending that which is chiefly incumbent on us all, an inviolable Duty and Allegiance to his Maje&s;ty, who by his valour has re&s;cued us from the two greate&s;t Plauges that ever infe&s;ted the World, <HI>Popery</HI> and <HI>Slavery,</HI> and by that, and his Wi&s;e and Temperate Government has &s;ecu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">'d us the free exerci&s;e of our holy <HI>Prote&s;tant Religion,</HI> the enjoyment of our Liberties and E&s;tates. And as a further In&s;tance and Illu&s;tration of the Glory of his Reign, His Maje&s;ty has, with repeated hazards of his precious Life, procured for Us and all <HI>Chri&s;tendom,</HI> a Glorious Peace, for which, <HI>Gentlemen</HI> let <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s Addre&s;s his Maje&s;ty, That he will be graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to accept of the tender of our mo&s;t humble Duty and Thanks.</P>
