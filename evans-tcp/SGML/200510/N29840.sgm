<HEAD>TO THE Reader.</HEAD>
<P>TO Pray to God is a Duty in|cumbent on every man in the World. An <HI>External</HI> as well as an Internal <HI>Adorati|on</HI> is due to him, on the account of his being our <HI>Creator.</HI> Psal. 95.6. <HI>O come let us worship &amp; bow down; Let us kneel before the Lord our Maker.</HI></P>
<P>It is true concerning Unregenerate men, that they sin in their Prayers. Nevertheless, Prayer is their Duty. They sin because they do not Pray from a right Principle, nor for a right End, nor after a right manner; yet the <HI>Act</HI> is not a sin but a duty. <HI>Si|mon Magus</HI> who was a very wicked man, was bid to <HI>pray God if perhaps the thought of his heart might be forgi|ven.</HI> And the Gracious God does sometimes so far regard the Prayers
<PB REF="039677_0003_10143A698816FBE0">
of Ungodly men, as to remove Tem|poral Afflictions and Judgments upon their Praying to him; as we &s;ee in <HI>Ahab, Rehoboam,</HI> and in the Men of <HI>Niniveh.</HI> Notwith&s;tanding which, there are many Prayerle&s;s Ones in the World. It were well if there were none &s;uch in <HI>New-England.</HI> They will have their doom with the Workers of Iniquity at the La&s;t Day. P&s;al. 14.4. <HI>Have the Workers of Ini|quity no knowledge, they call not on the Lord.</HI> A <HI>Prayerle&s;s</HI> man is mo&s;t cer|tainly an <HI>&V;ngodly</HI> man. P&s;al. 32.6. <HI>Every one that is godly will pray.</HI> A man does no &s;ooner begin to be a re|al Christian, but it will be &s;aid of him, <HI>Behold he prays,</HI> Acts 9.11. Yet it is reported there are many Prayerle&s;s Families. There was a time when there were few &s;uch Families in <HI>New-England.</HI> Whether there are any &s;uch in the Town where this Sermon was Preached, the Lord knows. If there are &s;uch, this Word will be a Witne&s;s again&s;t them another day. And there is a Scripture which may &s;trike Ter|ror into the heart of every Prayerle&s;s Ma&s;ter of a Family; It is that, Jer 10.25. <HI>Pour out thy fury upon the Hea|then
<PB REF="039677_0004_10143A6D6628E008">
that know thee not, and upon the Families that call not on thy Name.</HI> Such Families, altho' they may call them&s;elves Chri&s;tians, are no better than Heathen. Nay, they are le&s;s Religious. For the Heathen had their <HI>Penates,</HI> their Hou&s;hold Gods.</P>
<P>Prayer is always a duty, but e&s;pe|cially in a time of Affliction. Some that never Prayed before, when Di&s;|tre&s;s and danger has attended them, have betaken them&s;elves to their Prayers. Hence it has been a Pro|verbial &s;aying, <HI>Qui ne&s;cit orare, di&s;cat Navigare.</HI> 'Tis noted of <HI>Jonah</HI>'s Ma|riners, that when they were in dan|ger of being Ca&s;t away, they Cried every one to his God, and &s;aid to <HI>Jonah, Call upon thy God, if &s;o be God will think upon us, that we peri&s;h not.</HI> It argues great &s;tupidity and hardne&s;s of heart, when it can be &s;aid of any, <HI>the People turn not to him that &s;miles them, neither do they &s;eek the Lord of Ho&s;ts,</HI> I&s;a. 9.13.</P>
<P>To Excite and Direct Afflicted Ones in Prayer to God, is the Pious De&s;ign of the Author of this Di&s;|cour&s;e.
<PB REF="039677_0005_10143A6F18832580">
His Mode&s;ty made him un|willing to grant a Copy of his Ser|mon for Publication; but the Im|portunity of the principal of his Hearers, has at la&s;t obtained it from him, who has al&s;o de&s;ired my pe|ru&s;al of it. I find a &s;erious Spirit in it, &amp; a godly de&s;ign to promote the Intere&s;t of Religion, and the good of Souls, and hope it will prove beneficial not only to tho&s;e that heard it, but to others likewi&s;e.</P>
<P>It was a &s;ignal Favour of God to his People, that <HI>he rai&s;ed up of their Sons for Prophets, and of their Young men for Nazarites.</HI> This has he done for his <HI>New-England</HI> People, whereof the Writer of this Sermon is an encouraging In&s;tance.</P>
<P>I am leaving the World, having been a very Unprofitable Servant therein, and an unworthy Preacher of the Go&s;pel, for the &s;pace of Three&s;core Years.

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>AT the &s;eventh ver&s;e forego|ing, the Apo&s;tle exhorts the Chri&s;tians to whom he wrote this Epi&s;tle, and to|gether with them, all the Saints and People of God, in all Succeeding. A|ges and Generations, to be patient under the Sufferings it &s;hould plea&s;e their Sovereign Lord and Ma&s;ter, to exerci&s;e them with. <HI>Be patient Bre|thren</HI>&mdash;As tho' the Apo&s;tle had &s;aid, bear up with Chri&s;tian Courage and Fortitude, under all the &s;ore and hea|vy Trials; undergo the mo&s;t pre&s;|&s;ing Calamity, with a firmne&s;s and
<PB N="2" REF="039677_0008_10143A779792CE28">
&s;tayedne&s;s of mind, becoming the Character of Chri&s;t's Servants: Nei|ther manife&s;t any unea&s;ine&s;s under the Cro&s;s, or impatience under any affliction which is unbecoming the Relation you &s;tand in to the meek and lowly Je&s;us; and the Profe&s;&s;ion you have made of taking up the Cro&s;s, and following him: <HI>Of look|ing more at the things that are &V;n|&s;een &amp; Eternal, then at vi&s;ible, tem|poral or &s;en&s;ible things.</HI></P>
<P>And to quicken them thus to be patient until the Coming of their Lord, which he al&s;o in the &s;ame ver&s;e advi&s;eth them of; he further tells them in the next ver&s;e, <HI>That the time was drawing on apace, when their Lord and Head, who at pre&s;ent &s;ympathizes with them, will appear the &s;econd time without Sin unto Salvati|on; when he will deliver them out of all their Di&s;tre&s;&s;es, wipe all tears from their Eyes; take away the Body of Sin, as well as the burden of Sorrow; and make them Everla&s;tingly Ble&s;&s;ed and Happy.</HI></P>
<P>Again, He endeavours further to fortifie their minds again&s;t all Di&s;|couragements, by the Example of
<PB N="3" REF="039677_0009_10143A7940905920">
the holy Prophets, which have &s;po|ken in the Name of the Lord, <HI>ver&s;.</HI> 10. who though they were very dear to God, were yet notwith&s;tan|ding maligned, traduced and per&s;e|cuted by men; and are Exemplary for their unfainting per&s;everance un|der the mo&s;t grievous Sufferings from the tongues and hands of men.
<HI>Take the Prophets&mdash;for an Example of &s;uf|fering affliction and patience</HI>; they are &s;et forth as Examples of both; <Q>that if Chri&s;tians &s;uffer the &s;ame things, they may &s;uffer with the &s;ame minds.</Q></P>
<P>La&s;tly, He Encourages them by the Con&s;ideration of the pre&s;ent, as well as future Happine&s;s, that doth accrue to Chri&s;tians by their Suf|ferings; e&s;pecially by their patience under them, <HI>Ver.</HI> 11. <HI>Behold we count them happy which endure.</HI> Which A&s;&s;ertion, he Exemplifies in the Ca&s;e of afflicted patient <HI>Job; Ye have heard of the patience of</HI> Job, <HI>and have &s;een the end of the Lord.</HI>
<Q>The good i&s;&s;ue that God gave to all his troubles, in re&s;toring him to his former State, and doubling his Pro&s;perity.</Q>
Which in&s;tance of
<PB N="4" REF="039677_0010_10143A7ACD1BDD90">
Goodne&s;s &amp; Mercy, (for it is God here a&s;cribed to his merciful Nature) &s;hould Encourage his People to tru&s;t in him, (<HI>being the &s;ame ye&s;terday, to day and for ever</HI>) to expect and hope for a good end to all their troubles, whatever they be, and therefore to wait with patience for it.</P>
<P>Now our Text comes in as a word of Advice, under the foregoing Ex|hortation, wherein the Apo&s;tle di|rects Chri&s;tians under Afflictions, what method to take to obtain Grace whereby to Glorify God, and carry it becomingly under them; and that is by believing fervent Prayer, as you may see by comparing the Text and Context.&mdash;<HI>Is any among you afflict|ed? let him Pray.</HI> Where the Apo|&s;tle &s;uppo&s;eth there might be tho&s;e a|mong them, that were afflicted: And this he might well, &s;ince the People of God e&s;pecially are liable to trou|ble in this World. Is any among you Chri&s;tians, Profe&s;&s;ors of the Name of Chri&s;t, the Servants of the true and living God, afflicted Per&s;onally, or Relatively, by inward or outward Trouble? This Que&s;tion implies a &s;trong affirmation, that as &s;uch are
<PB N="5" REF="039677_0011_10143A7D13183EA0">
liable to, &s;o they may be under Affli|ction; they may be Exerci&s;ed as well as others, with Sickne&s;s, Poverty, Di&s;|grace; with the lo&s;s of dear Relati|ons, and the like. Now in this Ca&s;e, what method &s;hall a Chri&s;tian take, what shall he do, when afflicted in a|ny of the&s;e, or any other Regard? The Apo&s;tle an&s;wers in the next words: <HI>Let him pray,</HI> as though the Apo&s;tle had &s;aid, let him &s;eek unto God, &amp; commit his Cau&s;e unto him, <HI>who doth great things, and un&s;earchable, marvellous things without number; who &s;etteth up on high tho&s;e that be low, that tho&s;e which mourn may be ex|alted to &s;afety.</HI> Job 5.8, 9.11, 15. <HI>Let him Pray.</HI> It is expre&s;t in the Impe|rative Mood, and denotes duty; this is a Chri&s;tian's duty, and very &s;uita|ble at &s;uch a time. When a Chri&s;tian is under the Smiles of Divine Provi|dence, then it is &s;uitable for him to Rejoyce. <HI>Is any merry, let him &s;ing P&s;alms?</HI> and thereby expre&s;s and give vent to his Spiritual and Religious Joy. But when he is under a dark Cloud, (like one of tho&s;e, which in Winter days intercepts the Beams of the Sun) that deprives him of all
<PB N="6" REF="039677_0012_10143A7F6D075800">
pre&s;ent Comfort; it becomes him then the ca&s;t him&s;elf down &amp; Wor&s;hip God (as <HI>Job</HI> did.) Then he &s;hould &s;peak out of the Ground, and his Speech should be low out of the du&s;t, as the Prophet &s;peaks. The Doctrine which the words afford, is this, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Doct.</HI> That Prayer is a Duty very &s;uitable and nece&s;&s;ary in a time of Affliction.</P>
<P>This is a Duty &s;uitable &amp; nece&s;&s;ary at all times; for the Light of Nature teacheth it, as well as Divine Revela|tion Enforceth it. The Fundamental Rea&s;ons of which flow from the Di|vine Perfections and Excellencies, and that Relation we &s;tand in to God, as our Creator, Pre&s;erver &amp; Benefactor; which &s;trongly Infer an indi&s;pen&s;ible Obligation lying upon us, to Worship Him. Hence the very <HI>Heathens,</HI> who had only the dim Light of Nature to Guide them, paid a Natural Homage unto him (tho' in a blind manner;) and &s;ince we have the &s;uper-added Light of Revelation (which they had not) we can be no ways Excu&s;ed in the neglect of a duty, which is &s;o
<PB N="7" REF="039677_0013_10143A8171C04460">
&s;trongly Enforced therein. But tho' this Duty be &s;o &s;uitable and nece&s;&s;ary at all times, yet it is peculiarly &s;o in a time of Affliction; then God calls us to it more e&s;pecially, and our own nece&s;&s;ities put us upon it. The Doc|trine may be Explained and Confirm|ed under two Propo&s;itions.</P>
<P>As Namely,</P>
<P>Propo&s;ition I. <HI>That Chri&s;tians are liable to, and do often meet with Af|fliction in this World.</HI></P>
<P>Propo&s;ition II <HI>Prayer is a Duty ve|ry &s;uitable and nece&s;&s;ary in a time of Affliction.</HI></P>
<P>Propo&s;ition I. <HI>Chri&s;tians are liable to, and do often meet with Affliction in this World.</HI> This is the &s;ettled Portion and Inheritance of all men in this Life: <HI>Who are born unto trouble, as the Sparks flie upward.</HI> Tho' man's life in this World, be but of few days, yet it's full of trouble. And the be&s;t men in the World meet with &s;o much as may ju&s;tly cau&s;e them to cry out with the Wi&s;e man, <HI>Vanity of Vanities, all is vanity and vexation of
<PB N="8" REF="039677_0014_10143A851059FD48">
Spirit.</HI> The P&s;almi&s;t tells us, <HI>That the afflictions of the Righteous are ma|ny.</HI> P&s;al. 34.19. And we many in&s;tance in &s;ome of them. As namely,</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, in Poverty, which the Godly have no more &s;ecurity again&s;t, than any others: But they as often fall into low, mean, abject Circum|&s;tances, as any other men. Many that are rich in Faith, are however the poor of this World, <HI>James</HI> 2, 5. And this Condition has great temp|tation accompanying it, as well as a full and plentiful E&s;tate; and there|fore <HI>Agur</HI> deprecates them both, le&s;t being full he &s;hould deny God; or being poor, he &s;hould be tempted to take indirect ways to maintain him|&s;elf and his; and &s;o take the name of God in vain. <HI>Prov.</HI> 30.8, 9.</P>
<P>Again, Bodily Sickne&s;s is another Worldly Trouble, which they are not freed from by Chri&s;t, but are as liable to as others: It being appoint|ed unto all men once to die, and Sick|ne&s;s being Death's Harbinger, or Forerunner. Yea, many times, they are Exerci&s;ed with lingring, pining Sickne&s;s, with con&s;tant and &s;trong pain all their Lives, which take away
<PB N="9" REF="039677_0015_10143A8921111680">
the Comfort of Life. It's the porti|on of many Godly Per&s;ons to have this thorn in the fle&s;h. Thus it was with <HI>Gaius,</HI> who had a healthy Soul in a weakly Body. 3 <HI>Epi&s;t. Joh. v.</HI>2. And on this account, they may &s;ay, that they are in deaths oft.</P>
<P>Further, God &s;ometimes &s;uffers them to be afflicted with Reproaches and Di&s;grace: Who have been more vilifi|ed and contemned, than the Servants of God? Who&s;e Names have been more loaden with contumely or re|proach, than theirs? and as this is a great trial, (<HI>Reproach hath broken my heart,</HI> &s;ays the P&s;almi&s;t, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 69.20.) &s;o it is a great aggravation of it, when they have given their Enemies too much cau&s;e to Reproach them, by their imprudent or &s;inful Carriage&punc; Every man has a tender Regard to the honour of his Name. A Good One is rather to be cho&s;en than Great Riches; yea, it is next to life, and when that is touch't, a man is touch't in a very tender part. And tho' a man's Innocency is a good &s;upport to him, and the hope that &s;ome time or other, it will be clear'd up to the World; that this Good Name will be
<PB N="10" REF="039677_0016_10143A8B7342CD80">
taken out of the dirt, and be win'd clean; yet in the mean time, a man can't but be unea&s;ie under this &s;hock|ing Trial.</P>
<P>Once more, God &s;ometimes Exerci|&s;es his Children (and that very fre|quently) with the lo&s;s of dear Rela|tions, or with their mi&s;carriages, which is near as bad; God &s;ometimes afflicts his People with the Death of dear Relations. And tho' there be tho&s;e Con&s;iderations to be fetch't from the Word and Covenant of God, which &s;hould &s;till and quiet them un|der &s;uch trials; as that it's the Will of God it &s;hould be &s;o; and that as to godly Deceas'd Friends, it's better for them to be ab&s;ent from the Body, and to be pre&s;ent with Chri&s;t; their Death being an out-let to the trou|bles of this World, and an in-let to the Joys of the next: Yet notwith|&s;tanding, when the parting time comes, it's a great trial to them, a &s;ore fight of affliction. The Natural Affections and Pa&s;&s;ions will have vent, they will take their turn as well as Grace. Patient <HI>Job</HI> could not help giving vent to his grief and &s;orrow of heart, at the Death of his Chil|dren;
<PB N="11" REF="039677_0017_10143A8CF745DF30">
he rent his Mantle, and &s;haved his Head; which actions were tokens of grief in u&s;e among&s;t tho&s;e <HI>Ea&s;tern</HI> Nations.</P>
<P>Next to this Trial by the Death of Relations, is that other; when tho&s;e that are dear to them, take up with a licentious cour&s;e of Life, and give up them&s;elves to commit all Iniquity with greedine&s;s, e&s;pecially when they are irreclaimable; &s;o that the Advice, Reproofs or Coun&s;els of Friends, or any means that can be u&s;ed with them will not do, to prevent their running head-long to de&s;truction. This cuts them to the quick, and makes their very Souls bleed within them. This is in &s;ome &s;ort more grievous than to bury them; for hereby they are continued as living Cro&s;&s;es, and they are mourned for every day.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, The Godly &s;ometimes meet with inward as well as ouward Trou|ble. God &s;ometimes hides his face from them, and they are troubled, as it was with the P&s;almi&s;t, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 30.7. Sometimes they &s;uffer his terrours, as <HI>Heman</HI> did; who &s;ays, in <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 88.15, 16. <HI>I am afflicted, and ready to die from my youth up; while I &s;uffer thy
<PB N="12" REF="039677_0018_1014177029FCB010">
terrours, I am di&s;tracted.</HI> This the Godly are liable to, and do meet with more or le&s;s&punc; They have their ups and downs, in re&s;pect of Inward Spiritual Peace and Comfort; their Spring and Fall, Summer and Winter. This is their &s;tate of probation, and therefore not their Re&s;t: God &s;ees it be&s;t &s;ometimes thus to Exerci&s;e them, to bring them to a more immediate Dependance upon him&s;elf, in whom all their &s;prings are. And this they mu&s;t not think &s;trange of, nor think it hard dealing, &s;ince it is agreeable to the tenour of the New-Covenant of Grace, and no ways incon&s;i&s;tent with the faithfulne&s;s of God, who tho' he will and does Correct them when there is need of it; Yea, &s;ometimes to &s;how his Sovereignty: <HI>Yet he will not &s;uffer his Faithfulne&s;s to fail, nor alter the thing that is gone out of his mouth, P&s;al.</HI> 89.30, 31, 32, 33.</P>
<P>Prop. II. <HI>That Prayer is a Duty very &s;uitable and nece&s;&s;ary in a time of Affliction.</HI></P>
<P>Here we may &s;hew two things.</P>
<P N="1">1. That Prayer is very &s;uitable and nece&s;&s;ary in time of Affliction. And,</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="13" REF="039677_0019_10143A9590DA21F8">2. How the Duty mu&s;t be then managed; or how Afflicted Chri&s;ti|ans mu&s;t Pray.</P>
<P N="1">1. We are to &s;how, That Prayer is a very &s;uitable and nece&s;&s;ary Duty in Affliction. Afflicted Chri&s;tians &s;hould then go to God by Prayer.</P>
<P N="1">1. Becau&s;e God is the Author of Affliction. <HI>I make Peace, I Create E|vil,</HI> (&s;ays God) <HI>Is there Evil in the City, and the Lord has not done it? Ames</HI> 3.6. Which is not to be meant of the Evil of Sin, for that's an E|vil, which the perfectly infinitely Holy God can never be the Author of; But it's meant of the Evil of Puni&s;hment, or Affliction; for of this God is the Author. Affliction, (let the immediate Cau&s;es be what they will) is from the Hand of God. Some look upon afflictions as the pro|ductions of Natural Cau&s;es, or as Ca&s;ualties, or as the Effects of the di&s;plea&s;ure or inju&s;tice of men: If they are Sick, they are ready to at|tribute it to the Heat, or Cold; if a Lo&s;s comes in their E&s;tates, they a&s;|&s;cribe it to the carele&s;sne&s;s or fal&s;e|ne&s;s of their Servants, but they o|verlook the Hand of God. Now to
<PB N="14" REF="039677_0020_10143A97139058B8">
whom &s;hould Chri&s;tians have Re|cour&s;e, for relief and help under Af|fliction, but to the Author of their troubles; for he that &s;ends trouble, can remove it again. That hand that &s;trikes, can cau&s;e it &s;elf to cea&s;e from &s;triking. <HI>Remove thy &s;troke from me&punc; I am con&s;umed by the blow of thy hand. P&s;al.</HI> 39.10.</P>
<P N="2">2. Becau&s;e this is one end God aims at in afflicting his, that they may be thereby &s;tirr'd up to this Duty; they &s;hould therefore pray and &s;eek his face at &s;uch a time, in compliance with his de&s;ign therein. Many times when his Children grow remi&s;s or negligent in this duty, he afflicts 'em for it; it may be they are vi&s;ited with Sickne&s;s, or with &s;ome lo&s;s in their Estates; their Outward Affairs don't pro&s;per tho' managed with ne|ver &s;o much prudence; or they may be deprived of de&s;irable Relations, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Now the peculiar intent of God in tho&s;e afflictions and troubles, which light upon carele&s;s and &s;lothful Chri|&s;tians, is to humble them, for their neglects, and to quicken them to du|ty. Agreeably, &s;ays God, <HI>I will go, &amp; return to my place,</HI> (i. e.) <HI>withdraw

<P N="3">3. Becau&s;e their own benefit and intere&s;t obliges them to it. In this way only can they expect &s;upport under, a &s;anctify'd improvement of, and deliverance out of their afflicti|ons; for God only can do this for them, and for this he will be enqui|red of to do it for them. God only is able to &s;upport a Chri&s;tian under affliction: The lea&s;t Evil being too heavy for him to bear up chearfully under, unle&s;s the Everla&s;ting Arms be underneath him; Otherwi&s;e a Chri&s;tian will &s;oon grow impatient and di&s;ontented, or &s;ink under di&s;cou|ragement. How little a thing made <HI>Jonah</HI> angry, and wi&s;h to die, when his Spirit was out of frame. <HI>Jon.</HI> 4.9. But what will a Chri&s;tian do when he comes into the &s;wellings of <HI>Jor|dan?</HI> When he meets with great and &s;ore Trials, which he mu&s;t expect, un|le&s;s his hands be made &s;trong by the hands of the Mighty God of <HI>Jacob.</HI> Surely God's Grace only is &s;ufficient

for him, and therefore he mu&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> to God for his help, that he may nei|ther &s;light his hand, nor faint under his rebukes. <HI>Heb.</HI> 12.5.</P>
<P>Again, God only can and will make the Affliction turn to our Benefit, thro' Prayer and the &s;upply of the Spirit; whatever affliction a Chri&s;ti|an meets with, the Almighty de&s;igns it for good and advantage to him. The Fathers of our fle&s;h correct us many times for their plea&s;ure only; but whom the Lord corrects, he does it for our benefit, <HI>that we may be par|takers of his Holine&s;s,</HI> Heb. 12.10. He hath promi&s;ed, <HI>that all things &s;hall work together for good to them that love God, Rom.</HI> 8.28. and afflictions are &s;ome of tho&s;e things; they will not alone do us any good, 'tis not &s;o much from a|ny natural property, or inherent Ver|tue, that they do us good, as from the &s;anctifying Grace of God, and there|fore when Chri&s;tians are under God's afflicting hand, they &s;hould pray for a &s;anctified Improvement thereof.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, God only can deliver the Af|flicted Chri&s;tian out of his troubles: This God a&s;&s;umes to him&s;elf, as his Prerogative. <HI>I kill and I make alive,</HI>
<PB N="17" REF="039677_0023_10143A9E758A6BC0">
(says God) <HI>I wound and I heal; neither is there any that can deliver out of my hand. &V;nto God the Lord, belong the i&s;&s;ues from death.</HI> P&s;al. 68 20. <HI>He knoweth how to deliver the Godly out of temptations.</HI> 2 Pet. 2 9. <HI>Many are the afflictions of the Righteous, but the Lord delivers him out of them all.</HI> P&s;al. 34.19.

<P N="4">4. Becau&s;e God has &s;o expre&s;ly required, that Chri&s;tians &s;hould pray to him, as at other times, &s;o parti|cularly in time of Affliction. <HI>Is a|ny among you afflicted? Let him Pray in their affliction, they will &s;eek me early.</HI></P>

<P N="1">1.

If we would pray in a time of afflicti|on, or indeed at any other time, &s;o as to be heard and an&s;wered; we mu&s;t pray with Faith in the Name of Chri&s;t. We can be heard in no other Name, nor in his Name ex|cept we believe. <HI>If any man lack wi&s;dom, let him ask it of God,&mdash;but

<P N="2">2. Afflicted Chri&s;tians mu&s;t pray with Fervency. <HI>The fervent effectual Prayer of the Righteous man availeth much. v.</HI> 16. <HI>Context.</HI> But then this Fervency mu&s;t be more, than a meer natural earne&s;tne&s;s of Expre&s;&s;ion, e|ven vehemency of Spiritual Affecti|ons; an earne&s;tne&s;s &s;pringing from a &s;en&s;e of a per&s;ons need, and the worth of the Mercies he is praying for. One that is &s;en&s;ible of the&s;e, will be earne&s;t indeed; will wre&s;tle with God as <HI>Jacob</HI> did, and not give over till he hath obtained the Ble&s;&s;ing. Cold and dead Prayers argue indif|ferency, and tempt God to deny; but fervent prayers argue per&s;ons to be in good earne&s;t; they will turn to account. It's the Fervent Prayer that is Effectual.</P>
<P N="3">3. Per&s;ons at &s;uch a time, mu&s;t pray with Frequency and Con&s;tancy.

<P>U&s;e I. Of Information in two Infe|rences.</P>
<P>Inference I. Hence we Learn, that it's Un&s;uitable; yea, &s;inful to neglect Prayer in a time of Affliction; &s;o it is indeed at any time: But to do it in Affliction, is an aggravation of the Crime. <HI>Eliphaz</HI> blames <HI>Job,</HI> because (as he &s;uppo&s;ed) he neglected this duty, when he was &s;o &s;orely afflicted. <HI>Chap</HI> 15.4. <HI>Yea, thou ca&s;te&s;t off fear, and re&s;traine&s;t prayer before God.</HI> To neglect Prayer, when God is Cor|recting a Per&s;on or a People to &s;tir up a Spirit of Devotion in them, and to quicken them in their Addre&s;&s;es to God; it's very criminal. It's a &s;ad thing, when afflictions find us in the neglect of this Duty, when we don't meet them, as our Lord did his, in a praying po&s;ture; but it's more &s;ad and awful for them to leave us, as they found us; as negligent of our Duty, as regardle&s;s of God, and our Souls, as we were before; it's a &s;ign, that either the Chri&s;tian is not duly humbled; for if he were, he would be brought down to God's foot; it's a &s;ign that God's Rod has been &s;pent in
<PB N="25" REF="039677_0031_10143AB30C870800">
vain, as on his People of old; who&s;e afflictions &s;erv'd only to di&s;cover their pride and ob&s;tinacy, whil&s;t they did not return to him, nor &s;eek him after all. <HI>Ho&s;.</HI> 7.10. Or it's a &s;ign that the Chri&s;tian is over pow'rd with Temp|tation, and Di&s;couragement, which is as great an Evil on the other hand, &amp; will as effectually take him off from his duty; therefore the Apo&s;tle cau|tions again&s;t both. <HI>Heb.</HI> 12. <HI>De&s;pi&s;e not thou the Cha&s;tening,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Infer. II. Hence we learn the Ex|cellency of Divine Grace, which can cau&s;e Afflictions (that are part of the Cur&s;e) to turn to our benefit. Tem|poral Afflictions are Paenal Evils, part of the Cur&s;e which Sin has &s;ubjected Mankind unto. But tho' they be, and are not de&s;irable in them&s;elves, but are Evils to be deprecated; yet by the Grace of God, they may turn to our benefit. Indeed, (as has been hinted already) they can do us no good in them&s;elves, but as they are improved by God's Grace for this end. We &s;ee many Wicked men that are emptied from ve&s;&s;el to ve&s;&s;el, and harra&s;&s;ed with all &s;orts of afflictions, continue as bad as ever; it may be
<PB N="26" REF="039677_0032_10143AB491756FC8">
whil&s;t God's Cha&s;tening was upon them, they promi&s;ed fair, and pour'd out a Prayer to God. <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 26.16. But when the affliction is removed, they are as regardle&s;s of God as ever, and thereby evidence that they flattered him with their mouth, and lied unto him with their tongues. <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 78 34, 36. But when the Sanctifying Grace of God co-operates with Afflictions, they then turn to the Benefit of tho&s;e that are Exerci&s;ed with them. The Grace of God can bring meat out of this Eater, extract treacle out of this poy&s;on; and turn the very Cur&s;e in|to a Ble&s;&s;ing. When the affliction is &s;anctified, it makes per&s;ons more humble, holy, watchful, prayerful, o|bedient. <HI>Before I was afflicted I went a&s;tray, but now I have learnt to keep thy Commandments.</HI> P&s;al. 119.67. <HI>In their affliction they will &s;eek me early.</HI></P>
<P>U&s;e II. Of Conviction, and Awa|kening, to tho&s;e that do not Pray, when under Affliction; or are remi&s;s &amp; negligent in this Duty. Con&s;ider,</P>
<P N="1">1. That this &s;hews a very &s;tubborn and incorrigible frame of Heart: When God corrects a Chri&s;tian, he &s;tands over him (as it were) as a

<P N="2">2. Con&s;ider, That this is high Con|tempt of God; not only of his Au|thority, but his Power and Ju&s;tice: By neglecting Prayer, per&s;ons con|temn God's Authority in the Com|mand; by neglecting it in affliction, they contemn his Ju&s;tice and Power al&s;o; for hereby they dare him to do his wor&s;t: hereby they run upon the point of his Sword, charge upon the the thick bo&s;&s;es of his buckler.

<P>U&s;e 3. Of Examination or Trial in two Re&s;pects.</P>
<P N="1">1. As to the End of God in Affliction. <HI>Affliction cometh not out of the du&s;t, neither doth trouble &s;pring out of the ground</HI>: But it is ordered by an Infinitely Wi&s;e God, and therefore for &s;ome wi&s;e End. Let Affli|cted Chri&s;tians Examine what the End of God therein may be. <HI>Shew me &s;ays</HI> Job, <HI>wherefore thou comende&s;t with me?</HI> Ch. 9, 10. So let Chri&s;tians Enquire, what it is that God aims at in afflicting them; whether it be to &s;courge them for their Sins, or to try them; &s;ometimes God afflicts to try the Grace of his Children, as in the Ca&s;e of <HI>Job,</HI> tho' his Friends tho't otherwi&s;e, &amp; he him&s;elf could not well tell what to make of his afflictions at fir&s;t. But mo&s;t|ly, he does it to &s;courge and cha&s;ti&s;e them for their &s;ins. Let us then Examine, whe|ther the Afflictions we have been under by the Wa&s;ting Sickne&s;s that has been in this place, &amp; by the Death of &s;o many among&s;t us, e&s;pecially of Leading and Principal Men: <NOTE PLACE="foot"><HI>There Dyed in our Town, by that fatal Di&s;temper; upward of thirty grown per&s;ons, mo&s;tly <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span">: Hon.</HI> Ichabod Prai&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">d &amp; John Hill, Esqrs.</NOTE> (No &s;ooner was the Sword of

Or has he not done it al&s;o and chiefly, to humble us for our Sins? And what Sins hath God thus Cor|rected us for? May we not conclude, that he has herein been avenging the Quarrel of his Covenant, according to <HI>Rev.</HI> 26.25.

This is another &s;ign of their being beneficial: Mens hearts are apt to ri&s;e again&s;t God, when he Corrects them by his afflicting Hand; when it's &s;o&punc; not only at their fir&s;t meeting with affli|ction, (for then there may be too little difference between the Saint and Sinner) but in their parting with it, it's a &s;ign that the Affliction don't work kindly; but when it &s;erves to bring the Chri&s;tian to the foot of God, and to purge out the re|maining rebellion and &s;tubornne&s;s of the

heart, then it works kindly indeed.</P>
<P N="3">3. If Grace be Excited, and a Chri&s;tian thereby quickened to Duty. Afflictions tend to quicken Grace, to draw it forth into Exerci&s;e. Tribulation works patience, patience experience, <HI>&amp;c. Rom.</HI> 5.3, 4, 5. If there be any Grace in the heart, it will be di&s;covered at &s;uch a time, as well as Corruption. Have your Afflictions, Chri|&s;tian, &s;tirr'd up &amp; exerci&s;ed your Grace? Have they al&s;o quickened you to Duty, in which you might be remi&s;s or negli|gent? Have you made one Prayer the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">? Or have you pray'd at all? Have you pray'd more earne&s;tly, &amp; con&s;tantly? If it hath been thus, it's to be hop'd that Affliction hath been &s;anctified, and God's People have not been Corrected in vain.</P>
<P>U&s;e IV. Of Exhortation to the Afflicted to Pray. Farther, to quicken to Prayer.</P>
<P N="1">1. Con&s;ider the Relation you &s;tand in to God. The Rod is in the Hand of a Father. It's your Heavenly Father, Chri|&s;tian, that Corrects you. Whatever In|&s;trument is made u&s;e of, it is God that orders it. He makes u&s;e of it to Correct you; and he does it out of Love and Compa&s;&s;ion to your Souls. <HI>Whom the Lord oves he cha&s;tens, and corrects every &s;on whom he receives.</HI> He Corrects them to prevent their Everla&s;ting Ruine; therefore &s;ays the Apo&s;tle, in 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 11.32. <HI>But when we are judged, we are cha&s;tened of the Lord, that we &s;hould not be condemned with the Word.</HI>
<PB N="33" REF="039677_0039_10143AC698015708">
Be not di&s;couraged therefore by the Affli|ctions; but let them rather quicken and encourage you to go to God by Prayer, with all holy Reverence and Confidence, as Children to a Father, able and ready to help you.</P>
<P N="2">2. Con&s;ider, That Chri&s;t hath merited for you all you need, he Offers your Prayers with the Incen&s;e of his Merit; yea, he ever lives to make Interce&s;&s;ion. Chri&s;t hath not only Redeemed you from the Cur&s;e, by being made a Cur&s;e for you, but hath purcha&s;ed Grace, Glory, and e|very good thing for Believers: all that is needful to carry them well through this World, and to Crown them in the next. So that you may go boldly to the Throne of Grace, and ask for all the fruits of Chri&s;t's purcha&s;e; for tho' you are not worthy, Chri&s;t is; and in the virtue of his own merit he pre&s;ents your Addre&s;&s;es, and intercedes with the Father, to grant your Petitions: He is therefore repre|&s;ented as &s;tanding at the Golden Altar with much Incen&s;e, to offer it with the Prayers of the Saints; <HI>And the &s;moke of the Incen&s;e, which came up with the Prayers of the Saints a&s;cended up before God.</HI> Rev. 8.3, 4. Having therefore Brethren, boldne&s;s to enter into the Holie&s;t, by the Blood of Je&s;us, by a new and living way, which he hath Con&s;ecrated for us, through the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">, that is to &s;ay his fle&s;h; and having an High Prie&s;t over the Hou&s;e of God&punc;

let us draw near with a true heart, in full a&s;&s;urance of Faith. <HI>Heb.</HI> 10 19&mdash;22.</P>
<P N="3">3. Con&s;ider the Advantage and Benefit of Prayer in a time of Affliction, to get &amp; keep a good frame of heart, to &s;trengthen Faith and Patience to bear the burden of it. It's beneficial,</P>
<P N="1">1. To get and keep a good frame of heart, even a humble, re&s;igned, compo&s;ed frame. This frame of heart is needful for all Chri&s;tians, when under Afflictions. This brings Glory to God, and makes the Cro&s;s &s;it ea&s;y. Now Prayer tends to be|get and keep up this frame, by bringing the Soul to God's pre&s;ence, and awing it with his Sovereign Power, Wi&s;dom and Authority. It's meet to be &s;aid unto God, I have born Cha&s;ti&s;ement; this makes the will &s;ubmit, and the tumultuous pa&s;&s;ions are kept under a due regulation. Here|by it's made &s;en&s;ible of its own vilene&s;s, and ill de&s;erts, which &s;top the mouth of Complaint. <HI>Shall a living man complain? Man for the puni&s;hment of his Sin?</HI> Nay by Prayer the Soul breaths out its troubles. <HI>Griefs</HI> (as one &s;ays) <HI>are ea&s;ed by Groans: The heart is cooled and disburthened by Spiri|tual Evaporations.</HI> The Mind is by this means made and kept calm and ea&s;ie. There is an Halcyon Calm within, many times, when it's all &s;tormy and tempe&s;tu|ous round about.</P>
<P N="2">2. Prayer is needful to &s;trengthen Faith and Patience: To &s;trengthen Faith.
<PB N="35" REF="039677_0041_10143AC9A17B3A60">
Faith is the Souls prop under Affliction. <HI>I had fainted unle&s;s I had believed,</HI> &s;ays the P&s;almi&s;t. <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 27.13. This will buoy up the Soul, when the breaking Billows of Affliction go over its head, ready to &s;wal|low it up. <HI>Unle&s;s thy Law had been my De|lights, I &s;hould then have peri&s;hed in mine af|fliction.</HI> P&s;al. 119.92. The meaning is, That if he had not believed in, and laid hold of God's gracious Promi&s;es, which were his comfort and delight, he could not have been carried thro' his Afflicti|ons. Now Prayer &s;erves to &s;trengthen Faith in Chri&s;t, and the precious Promis|&s;es, that are <HI>Yea</HI> in him, &amp; in him <HI>Amen</HI>; hereby new &s;trength and vigour is derived from the Fountain to the Soul. Thus doubtle&s;s it was, with re&s;pect to <HI>Peter</HI>'s Faith upon our Lord's Praying for him, <HI>that his Faith might not fail.</HI> Luke 22.31, 32. Tho' he fell, his faith did not utterly fail. Thus <HI>Paul</HI>'s Prayer in his affliction, brought new and fre&s;h &s;upplies of Grace&punc; tho' he had not pre&s;ent &s;peedy deliverance, yet he had &s;upport, &s;trengthening Grace, which was better. <HI>My Grace &s;hall be &s;uffi|cient for thee.</HI> 2 Cor. 12.9.</P>
<P>Again, Prayer is nece&s;&s;ary to &s;trengthen and increa&s;e a Chri&s;tian's Patience. This is al&s;o a very u&s;eful Grace under Affli|ction: This makes a Chri&s;tian ea&s;ie in his mind, even when God's hand pre&s;&s;eth him fore. Impatient, di&s;contented per&s;ons, they are &s;o far from being ea&s;ie, that their

unea&s;ine&s;s <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> other troubles&punc; Now Prayer is u&s;eful to &s;trengthen pati|ence, and perfect it; <HI>it mu&s;t have its per|fect work.</HI> Jam. 1.4. in making Chri&s;tians ab&s;olutely &s;ubject to God's Will, &amp; con|&s;tant to the end, under afflictions; and the way the Apo&s;tle directs to, for the &s;trengthening of it, is by Prayer, in the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">th ver&s;e. <HI>If any of you lack Wi&s;dom? Let him ask it of God:</HI> Where (as one &s;ays upon the place) <HI>Wi&s;dom is to be re&s;train|ed, according to the Circum&s;tances of the Text, and taken for wi&s;dom or skill to bear Afflicti|ons&punc; &s;o. as to Rejoice in them.</HI> Our Lord prefaces his Sufferings&punc; with Prayer, to &s;how us the benefit and nece&s;&s;ity of it in Affliction: and who &s;o patient, meek, &amp; lamb-like as He: Go then, (thou poor afflicted Chri&s;tian, go) to God in the Name of Chri&s;t, and tell him, how hard thou art put to it, what a grievous bur|den lieth upon thee, how weak thou art in thy &s;elf; that thou do&s;t not de&s;ire ea&s;e &amp; a relea&s;e, &s;o much as Faith and Pati|ence, to bear what he is pleas'd to lay up. on thee; and wait thus upon him, and &s;urely it will not be in vain.</P>
<P>U&s;e V. Of Con&s;olation, to tho&s;e under Affliction; who are thereby quickened to Prayer; that find on experience, that their hearts go out to God, for his Pre&s;ence and Grace, as well as for deliverance; for faith &amp; patience to bear his Afflicting Hand, as well as for ea&s;e and relief under it; who
<PB N="37" REF="039677_0043_10143ACF09251C38">
pray more earne&s;tly, con&s;tantly, and be|lievingly, than ever. This is matter of Comfort to you: In that,</P>
<P N="1">1. You have therein a good evidence, a &s;ure token that God is with you, and will never leave nor for&s;ake you. It is the fruit of his Gracious Pre&s;ence to quicken your hearts to, and in this Duty. If then you feel your hearts begin to move God-ward, and Chri&s;t-ward in the way of Du|ty; or to move more livelily than ever: If your troubles cau&s;e you to look up in good earne&s;t, to the Throne of Grace, 'tis a &s;ign that God is pre&s;ent with you by his Grace, and what a comfortable Con&s;ide|ration is this. We count it a great privi|lege to have our Friends near us when we are Sick, or under any other Afflicti|on; but what is this to the having GOD pre&s;ent with us, at &s;uch a time, enliven|ing, quickening and comforting us? As 'tis a great aggravation of trouble, for the Lord to withdraw the comfortable &s;en&s;e of his Pre&s;ence and Love: This puts an edge upon Affliction&punc; So on the contrary, his favourable, gracious, comforting, quick|ening Pre&s;ence, is a great alleviation thereof. Therefore the P&s;almi&s;t prays God not to be far off, becau&s;e trouble was near. <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 22.11. Now this is a good Token that he is pre&s;ent with &s;uch, when their hearts are quickened by his Grace; And it &s;hould be a Comfort to &s;uch. This was the P&s;almi&s;t's Comfort in his Afflicti|on:
<PB N="38" REF="039677_0044_10143AD16C0C9C80">
That God's Word had quickened him. <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 119.50. And as this is a &s;ign that God is with &s;uch, &s;o that he will never leave them, nor for&s;ake them utter|ly. Indeed he may hide his face from them, or for&s;ake them for a moment, as he &s;peaks. <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 14.7, 8. But with great Mercies will he gather them. <HI>In a little wrath I hid my face,&mdash;But with everla&s;t|ing kindne&s;s will I have mercy on thee, &amp;c.</HI> So that God will not leave &s;uch ut|terly, and &s;o he hath expre&s;ly engaged. <HI>Heb.</HI> 13.5. And this is evident from their &s;anctified afflictions, wherein they may read their Heavenly Father's Love. And tho&s;e whom he once loves, he always loves. The gifts &amp; calling of God be|ing without Repentance. What a com|fort may this ju&s;tly be, to an Afflicted Soul! Well may a Chri&s;tian &s;ay. <HI>Though God afflicts me, yet he will not for&s;ake me, nor ca&s;t me off for ever; and as long as I am &s;ure of this, I can the better bear what he is plea|&s;ed to lay upon me.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. This is a &s;ign that their Afflictions &s;hall do them good, and end well. The chief thing that gracious Souls &s;hould look at under Affliction is, that they may Glorify God, and get good by it. And they &s;hould be afraid of nothing &s;o much, as the contrary. Now when they &s;ee the pre&s;ent fruits, in a humble re&s;igned frame of Spirit in a Soul quickened to Duty: Why, this gives them comfortable encou|raging
<PB N="39" REF="039677_0045_10143AD2F3EFF5A0">
grounds to hope, that it &s;hall turn to their benefit. Yea, this &s;hows them that it is &s;o already. Now what a Comfort is this, to an afflicted Chri&s;tian; who may be ready &s;ometimes under temp|tation to fear and &s;ay, as <HI>Job</HI> did, in his Calamities, <HI>Wherefore hide&s;t thou thy face, and holde&s;t me for thine Enemy?</HI> Job 13.24. They may be ready to fear that God is puni&s;hing as a <HI>Judge,</HI> and not correcting as a <HI>Father</HI>; and indeed if a Chri&s;tian were to bear Affliction only as the pu|ni&s;hment of his Sins, or the beginning of it, and were to receive no benefit by it; this were a killing Con&s;ideration: But this no humble prayerful Soul has any rea&s;on to fear. He has no rea&s;on to look thus upon his Afflictions, how grievous &s;oever; but as a Rod in the hand of a Father, who is &s;eeking his benefit, &amp; not his ruine: Who does not willingly grieve the Children of men, much le&s;s his own; and who, when he does it, aims at their profit, that they may be partakers of his Holine&s;s: And the afflicted Chri&s;tan finds the truth of this, in God's cau&s;ing Affli|ons to work for his good already, and not afflicting him in vain.</P>
<P>And &s;uch Afflictions will end happily. How grievous &s;oever they are at pre&s;ent, they will in the end, yield the quiet and peaceable fruits of Righteou&s;ne&s;s to them which are Exerci&s;ed thereby. They that sow in tears, &s;hall reap in joy: Weeping

Though none can tell how long God may plea&s;e to Ex|erci&s;e the Chri&s;tian with this or that Af|fliction, yet the Scripture a&s;&s;ures us, that the troubles of God's People &s;hall End happily: And this light Affliction which is but for a moment, &s;hall work out a far more exceeding and eternal weight of Glory. 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 4.17.
