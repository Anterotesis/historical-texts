<P N="2">2.

<P>It runs in &s;uch Terms as the&s;e.</P>
<Q><P>Many were the Outrages and In&s;ultings of the <HI>Indians</HI> upon the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> while Sir <HI>E. A.</HI> was Governour. At <HI>North Yarmouth,</HI> and other places at the Ea&s;tward, the Indians killed &s;undry Cattel, came into Hou&s;es, and threatned to knock the people on the Head; and at &s;everal Times gave out Reports, that they would make a <HI>War</HI> upon the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and that they were ani|mated to do &s;o, by the <HI>French.</HI> The <HI>Indians</HI> behaving them&s;elves &s;o in&s;ultingly, gave ju&s;t occa&s;ion of great &s;u&s;picion.

The &s;aid Capt. <HI>Blackman</HI> Seized to the Number of between Sixteen and Twenty, in order for their Ex|amination,

and to bring in the re&s;t to a Treaty. The &s;aid <HI>Blackman</HI> &s;oon &s;ent the &s;aid <HI>Indians,</HI> with a Good Guard, to <HI>Falmouth,</HI> in <HI>Ca&s;co bay,</HI> there to be Secured, until orders could come from <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> concerning them. And in the mean Time, the &s;aid <HI>Indians,</HI> were well provided with Provi&s;ions, and Suitable Nece&s;&s;aries The re&s;t of the Indians Robb'd the Engli&s;h, and took &s;ome Engli&s;h Pri&s;oners: Whereupon Po&s;t was &s;ent to <HI>Bo&s;ton.</HI> Sir <HI>Edmond Andro&s;s</HI> being at <HI>New-York,</HI> the Gentlemen of <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> &s;ent to <HI>Falmouth,</HI> &s;ome Souldiers for the Defence of the Country, and al&s;o the Wor&s;hipful Mr. <HI>Stoughton,</HI> with others, to Treat with the <HI>Indians,</HI> in order for the Settling of a <HI>Peace,</HI> and getting in of our Engli&s;h Captives. As &s;oon as the &s;aid Gentle|men arrived at the Ea&s;t-ward, they &s;ent away one of the <HI>Indian</HI> Pri&s;oners, to the re&s;t of the <HI>Indians,</HI> to Summon them, to bring in the Eng|li&s;h they had taken; Al&s;o, that their <HI>Sachims</HI> &s;hould come in, to treat with the Engli&s;h, in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rder that a Ju&s;t Satisfaction &s;hould be made on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oth &s;ides. The Gentlemen waited the Return of the <HI>Indian</HI> Me&s;&s;enger; and when he Return|ed, he brought An&s;wer, That they would meet our Engli&s;h at a place, called, <HI>Macquoit,</HI> and there they would bring in the Engli&s;h Captives, and Treat with the Engli&s;h. And although the place appointed by the <HI>Indians,</HI> for the Meeting, was &s;ome Leagues di&s;tant from <HI>Fal|mouth,</HI>
<PB N="18" REF="000873_0017_0FAC92C259992960">
yet our Engli&s;h Gentlemen did conde|&s;cend to it, in hope of getting in our Captives, &amp; putting a &s;top to further Trouble. They Di&s;|patch'd away to the place, and carried the <HI>In|dian</HI> Pri&s;oners with them, and &s;taid at the place appointed, expecting the coming of the <HI>Indi|ans,</HI> that had promi&s;ed a Meeting. But they like fal&s;e perfidious Rogues did not appear. Without doubt they had been coun&s;elled what to do, by the <HI>French,</HI> and their Abettors; as the <HI>Indians</HI> did declare a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">terwards; and that they were near the place, and &s;aw our <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> that were to Treat with them, but would not &s;hew them&s;elves, but did Endeavour to take an Opportunity to De&s;troy our Engli&s;h, that were to Treat them. Such was their Treachery! Our Gentlemen &s;taid days to wait their co|ming; but &s;eeing they did not appear at the place appointed, they Returned to <HI>Falmouth,</HI> and brought the Indian Pri&s;oners; expecting that the other <HI>Indians</HI> would have &s;ent down &s;ome Rea&s;on, why they did not appear at the place appointed, and to make &s;ome excu&s;e for them&s;elves. But in&s;tead of any compliance, they fell upon <HI>North Yarmouth,</HI> and there kill'd &s;everal of our Engli&s;h. Whereupon the Ea&s;t|ern parts were ordered to get into Garri&s;ons, and to be upon their Guard, until further Or|ders from Sir <HI>Edmond Andros</HI>; and that the In|dian Pri&s;oners &s;hould be &s;ent to <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI>; which
<PB N="19" REF="000873_0018_0FAC92C3AD6FED70">
was done with great care, and not one of them hurt; and care taken daily for provi&s;ion. But Sir <HI>E. A.</HI> Returning from <HI>New-York,</HI> &s;et them all at Liberty; not &s;o much as taking care to Redeem tho&s;e of our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> for them, that were in their hands. I had kept one at <HI>Fal|mouth,</HI> a Pri&s;oner to be a Guide into the Woods, for our Engli&s;h, to find out the Haunts of our Heathen Enemies. But Sir <HI>E.

<P>It will be readily Acknowledged, that here was enough done, to render the <HI>Indians</HI> Inexcu|&s;able, for not coming in, upon the <HI>Proclamation,</HI> which Sir <HI>Edmond Andros,</HI> then Governour of <HI>New-England,</HI> immediately Emitted thereupon, requiring them, to Surrender the <HI>Murderers,</HI> now among them. A Spaniard, that was a Souldier, would &s;ay, <HI>That if we have a Good Cau&s;e, the &s;mell of Gunpowder in the Field is as &s;weet as the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ncen&s;e at the Altar.</HI> Let the Reader judge after the&s;e things, what &s;cent there was in the <HI>Gun|powder</HI> &s;pent for Nine or Ten years together in our <HI>War</HI> with the <HI>Indian Salvages.</HI></P>
<P>Now, that while we are upon this Head, we

<P><Q>Such were the <HI>Ob&s;cure Mea&s;ures</HI> taken at that Time of Day, that the <HI>Ri&s;e</HI> of this <HI>War,</HI> hath been as dark as that of the River <HI>Nilus</HI>; only the Generality of <HI>Thinking People</HI> through the Country, can Remember <HI>When,</HI> and <HI>Why,</HI> every one did foretel, <HI>A War.</HI> If any <HI>Wild Engli&s;h</HI> (for there are &s;uch as well as of another Na|tion,) did then, <HI>Begin</HI> to Provoke and Affront the <HI>Indians,</HI> yet tho&s;e <HI>Indians</HI> had a fairer way to come by Right, than that of <HI>Blood &s;hed</HI>; no|thing worthy of, or calling for, any <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ch</HI> Re|venge was done unto them.

Cruel Hands: but <HI>Gendal</HI> with his, got a Re|lea&s;e, one can &s;carce tell, <HI>How,</HI> upon the Re|turn of tho&s;e which had been detain'd in <HI>Bo&s;ton.</HI> Hitherto there was no Spilling of <HI>Blood</HI>! But &s;ome Time in <HI>September</HI> following, this Capt. <HI>Gen|dal,</HI> went up, with Souldiers and others, to a place above <HI>Ca&s;co,</HI> called, <HI>North Yarmouth</HI>; having Orders to build <HI>Stookado<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s,</HI> on both &s;ides the Ri|ver, for Defence of the place, in ca&s;e of any Sud|den Inva&s;ion. While they were at work, an <HI>Engli&s;h Captive</HI> came to 'em, with Information, that Seventy or Eighty of the Enemy were ju&s;t coming upon 'em: and he advi&s;ed 'em, <HI>To yeeld quietly, that they might Save their Lives.</HI> The Souldiers that went thither from the Southward, being terrifyed at this Report, Ran with an Ha&s;ty Terror to get over the River; but with more <HI>Ha&s;t,</HI> than <HI>Good Speed</HI>; for they ran directly into the Hands of the <HI>Indians.</HI> The <HI>Indians</HI> dragging along the&s;e their Pri&s;oners with 'em, came up to|wards the <HI>Ca&s;conians</HI>; who, having but a very Little Time to Con&s;ult, yet in this Time Re&s;olved; Fir&s;t, <HI>That they would not be Seized by the Salvages</HI>; Next, <HI>That they would free their Friends out of the Hands of the Salvages, if it were po&s;&s;ible</HI>; Thirdly, <HI>That if it were po&s;&s;ible, they would u&s;e all other Force upon the Salvages, without coming to down right Fight.</HI> Accordingly, They laid hold on their Neighbours, whom the <HI>Salvages</HI> had Seized, and this with &s;o much Dexterity, that
<PB N="24" REF="000873_0023_0FAC92C7268D3F58">
they cleared them all, Except one or Two; whereof the whole Number was about a <HI>Dozen.</HI> But in the <HI>Scuffle,</HI> one Sturdy and Surly <HI>Indian,</HI> held his prey &s;o fa&s;t, that one <HI>Benedict Pulcifer,</HI> gave the <HI>Mastiff</HI> a Blow, with the Edge of his <HI>Broad Ax</HI> upon the Shoulder, upon which they fell to't with a Vengeance, and Fired their <HI>Guns,</HI> on both &s;ides, till &s;ome on both &s;ides were Slain.

At la&s;t, the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> Victoriou&s;ly cha&s;ed away the Salvages, and Re|turned &s;afely unto the other &s;ide of the River. And Thus was the <HI>Vein</HI> of <HI>New England</HI> fir&s;t o|pened, that afterwards <HI>Bled</HI> for Ten years toge|ther! The Skirmi&s;h being over, Capt. <HI>Gendal,</HI> in the Evening, pa&s;&s;ed over the River, in a Ca|noo, with none but a Servant; but Landing where the Enemy lay hid in the Bu&s;hes, they were both Slain immediately.

<P><HI>Bomma&s;een,</HI> was, with &s;ome other Indians, now a Pri&s;oner, in <HI>Bo&s;ton.</HI> He de&s;ired a Confe|rence with a Mini&s;ter, of <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> which was granted him. <HI>Bomma&s;een,</HI> with the other <HI>Indians</HI> a&s;&s;enting and a&s;&s;erting to it, then told the Mini&s;ter, That he pray'd his In|&s;truction in the <HI>Chri&s;tian Religion</HI>; ina&s;much as he was afraid, that the <HI>French,</HI> in the <HI>Chri&s;tian Re|ligion,</HI> which they taught the <HI>Indians,</HI> had Abu&s;ed them.

He &s;aid&punc; The <HI>French</HI> taught 'em, That the Lord JESUS CHRIST, was of the <HI>French Nation</HI>; That His Mother, the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> was a <HI>French Lady</HI>; That they were the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> who had Murdered him; and,
<PB N="128" REF="000873_0127_0FAC93B516645490">
That whereas He Ro&s;e from the Dead, &amp; went up to the Heavens, all that would Recommend them&s;elves unto His Favour, mu&s;t Revenge His Quarrel upon the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> as far as they can.

<P>He told them, [&s;till with proper Actions painting, and pointing out the <HI>Signs</HI> unto them,] That our Lord JESUS CHRIST, had given us, a <HI>Good Religion,</HI> which might be Re&s;embled unto the <HI>Good Drink in the Cup,</HI> upon the Table.</P>

<P>The <HI>Indians</HI> Expre&s;&s;ing them&s;elves to be well-Satisfied, with what the Mini&s;ter had hitherto &s;aid, pray'd him, to go on, with &s;howing 'em, what was the <HI>Good Drink,</HI> and what was the <HI>Poi|&s;on,</HI> which the <HI>French</HI> had put into it.</P>

<P>Whereupon, he demon&s;trated unto them, how the <HI>Papists</HI> had in their Idolatrous <HI>Popery,</HI> &s;ome way or other Depraved, and Altered, every one of the&s;e <HI>Articles</HI>; with Scandalous <HI>Ingredients</HI> of

<P><HI>Two</HI> Things we will venture to In&s;ert.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> For <HI>our &s;elves,</HI> at home, Let us Remem|ber an awful Saying of our <HI>Goodwin,</HI> quoted by my Reverend Friend, Mr. <HI>Noyes,</HI> in his late Excellent Sermon at our Anniver&s;ary <HI>Election.</HI></P>
<P><Q>As you Look for <HI>Storms</HI> in <HI>Autumn,</HI> and <HI>Frosts</HI> in <HI>Winter,</HI> &s;o Expect <HI>Judgments,</HI> where the Go&s;pel hath been Preached; for the Quar|rel of the Covenant mu&s;t be Avenged.</Q></P>
<P>Secondly. For <HI>the Church</HI> abroad, I am far from de&s;erting, what was A&s;&s;erted, in the Sermon Preached at our Anniver&s;ary Election, in the year, 1696.
<Q>The <HI>Tidings</HI> which I bring unto you, are, That there is a <HI>Revolution,</HI> and a <HI>Reformation,</HI> at the very Door, which will be va&s;tly more wonderful, than any of the Deliverances yet &s;een by the Church of God, from the Beginning of the World, I do

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>WHen the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> were Engaged in a WAR, they made choice of a <HI>Priest</HI> among them, to Serve &s;ome of their greate&s;t Occa&s;ions in it, and after a <HI>Sacred Unction</HI> be&s;tow'd upon him, we are told by <HI>Maimonides,</HI> he was call'd <HI>Ma&s;huach Milchamah,</HI> that is to &s;ay, <HI>Unctus Belli</HI>; which was as much as to &s;ay, <HI>The Prie&s;t of the War.</HI></P>
<P>To bring unto a People profitable Advices &amp; Reflections upon a WAR, wherein they are En|gaged, and &s;ound the <HI>Silver Trumpet,</HI> of the Go&s;|pel, with agreeable Notes unto them in it, is to do in &s;ome &s;ort, the Office of the <HI>Ma&s;huach Mil|chamah</HI>&punc; and this Office the En&s;uing Di&s;cour&s;e pre&s;umes to do, with Endeavours that the Voice of Heaven by the <HI>Trumpet</HI> of our late <HI>War,</HI> may he heard giving a <HI>certain Sound,</HI> in the&s;e <HI>Echo's</HI> of it.</P>
<P>The Hi&s;tory of a long <HI>War,</HI> hath, with all po&s;|&s;ible care of <HI>Truth,</HI> been given you. The Author Earne&s;tly prayes, that if the lea&s;t material <HI>Mi&s;take</HI> have happened in the Hi&s;tory, <HI>He</HI> may be Ad|vi&s;ed, &amp; <HI>It</HI> may be corrected. The Noi&s;e that may be made, by a few Sordid People, here &amp; there, in a Room <HI>Tophetized</HI> with Smoke, and Rhum, and Spittle, and Malice, and <HI>Lyes,</HI> crying out concerning the mo&s;t Con&s;cientious E&s;&s;ayes, to pre&s;erve <HI>Memorable Truths, They are a parcel of Lies</HI>! He values not. But he now tenders to the Acceptance of the more <HI>Civilized Readers,</HI> an Improvement of <HI>Memorable Truths,</HI> which it was <HI>His</HI> Duty to <HI>make,</HI> &amp; it will be <HI>Theirs</HI> to <HI>mind.</HI></P>

<HEAD>THE REMARKEABLES of a long WAR, Collected and Improved.</HEAD>

<P>IF a <HI>Book</HI> of &s;ome Con&s;equence, be laid open before one that cannot <HI>Read,</HI> he may Look, and Gaze upon it; but unto what purpo&s;e, as long as he cannot un|der&s;tand it? This very Compari&s;on, is by the Great <HI>Au&s;tin</HI> well applyed unto, The <HI>Judgments</HI> of God. And I will therefore &s;o far Improve the Compari&s;on, as to ob&s;erve, That the <HI>Judgments</HI> of God, under which we have been Langui&s;hing for <HI>Ten years</HI> together, are a &s;ort of a <HI>Book</HI> put into our Hands; a <HI>Book</HI> indeed all writ|ten in <HI>Blood</HI>; a <HI>Book</HI> yet full of <HI>Divine Le&s;&s;ons</HI> for us. But can every man Read this Terrible

<HI>Books</HI>? No, Methinks, I &s;ee the <HI>Book</HI> managed like the <HI>Book</HI> brought unto the Ble&s;&s;ed Prophet of old, in I&s;a. 29.12. <HI>The Book is delivered unto him that is not Learned, Saying, Read this, I pray thee; and he &s;aith, I am not Learned.</HI> It will cer|tainly Be a work, well becoming a <HI>Mini&s;ter</HI> of the Go&s;pel, and every Serious <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> will be glad of &s;eeing the Work done; To take this <HI>Book,</HI> and help you, as well as we can to <HI>Spell</HI> the <HI>Di|vine Le&s;&s;ons</HI> contained in it.</P>
<P><HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> Let us now do a work, for which the Great God hath given us, that Warrant, and that Command, in

<P>Who is Wi&s;e, and will ob&s;erve the&s;e Things?</P></Q></P>
<P>THe various and marvellous Di&s;pen&s;ations of the Divine Providence, towards the Chil|dren of men, are in this Elegant <HI>P&s;alm</HI> admirably &s;et before us. Among tho&s;e Di&s;pen&s;ations, there is a particular mark &s;et upon this, That the God of Heaven <HI>Turns a Fruitful Land into Barrenne&s;s, for the Wickedne&s;s of them which dwell therein</HI>; &amp; tho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">gh men have <HI>Sown Fields there and have multiplied greatly, yet they are again Dimini&s;hed, &amp; brought Low through Oppre&s;&s;ion, Affliction, and Sor|row.</HI> Of &s;uch Di&s;pen&s;ations, is this pa&s;&s;age to be under&s;tood, as a Quae&s;tion, <HI>Who is wi&s;e, and will ob&s;erve the&s;e things</HI>? But if you will rather take it

as a Sentence, it &s;till comes to the &s;ame &s;en&s;e, <HI>Who|&s;e is wi&s;e, will o&s;erv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the&s;e Things.</HI> And the French Ver&s;ion very Expre&s;&s;ively intimates the <HI>De&s;ign,</HI> as well as the <HI>Event</HI> of this <HI>Ob&s;ervation; That &s;o they may con&s;ider the Favours of the Lord.</HI> No Le&s;s than Ten years have Rolled away, &s;ince we have been plunged into the Di&s;tre&s;&s;es of a WAR, with a Barbarous Enemy. In this WAR, we have &s;een the <HI>Fruitful Land</HI> of almo&s;t one whole Province, and another whole County <HI>turned into Barrenne&s;s</HI>; doubtle&s;s, not without provocations of <HI>Wickedne&s;s in them, who dwelt therein</HI>; Men had <HI>Sown Fields</HI> there along the Shore in Settle|ments for an Hundred miles together, and had <HI>Multiplied Greatly</HI> into a Clu&s;ter of <HI>Towns</HI> (be|&s;ides Le&s;&s;er <HI>Villages,</HI>) that might Challenge the Name of a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>Decapolis</HI>; but in this WAR, we have &s;een them <HI>Dimini&s;hed again and brought Law, through Oppre&s;&s;ion, Affliction, and Sorrow.</HI> I am to Lead you this day thro' a Spacious Country, which has been on many Accounts, the mo&s;t Charming part of <HI>New-England</HI>; and I mu&s;t herewithal &s;ay, <HI>Come, Behold the works of the Lord, what De&s;olations He has made in that Land.</HI> Syrs, 'Tis time for us, to <HI>Ob&s;erve the&s;e Things</HI>; and this, not with a meer <HI>Athenian,</HI> but with a more <HI>profitable</HI> Ob&s;ervation.

<P N="1"><HI>I.</HI> In the WAR that hath been upon us, <HI>Who&s;o is Wi&s;e, may ob&s;erve</HI> the Con&s;equence of Entertaining the <HI>Go&s;pel</HI> of the Lord JESUS CHRIST, and Obtaining and Mentaining the <HI>Ordinances</HI> of that Glorious Go&s;pel.

Alas, How little of an <HI>Evangeli|cal Church-State,</HI> was there to be &s;een among all our <HI>Eastern Settlements</HI>!

without <HI>Churches</HI> of CHRIST, for to Irradiate 'em: Yea, not one of the Towns, that are utterly broken up, had any <HI>Minister</HI> in it, for a long while before their Final Darkne&s;s came upon them. Such a <HI>Way of Living</HI> did content many of them, that it were horrible to Tell, what Ignorance of CHRIST they were thereby &s;unk into.

and no further</HI>! But here let me add a very ob|&s;ervable Thing: The Lord had &s;ome of His <HI>Elect</HI> among our <HI>Ea&s;tern People</HI>; but He ha's brought tho&s;e <HI>Elect Home</HI> unto Him&s;elf, by burn|ing them out of their <HI>Homes</HI> and Habitations. The <HI>Indians</HI> have driven 'em hither, and here they have met with the Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t, and been effectually Called unto the Lord, and Joyn|ed unto our Churches, and Ble&s;&s;ed the Name of God for bringing them unto the&s;e Churches. <HI>Perii&s;&s;ent ni&s;i Perii&s;&s;ent!</HI> Now, <HI>Who&s;o is Wi&s;e, and will ob&s;erve the&s;e things,</HI> cannot but wi&s;h, That the <HI>Folly</HI> of Erecting Plantations, without the wor&s;hip of the Lord JESUS CHRIST, may be no more committed among us. It was whole|&s;ome Coun&s;il, Given, and u&s;ually Taken, in the Beginning of <HI>New-England</HI>;
<Q>Let Chri&s;tians no where &s;it down without Good Mini&s;ters, but let them rather tarry where they are, as <HI>Ezra</HI> tarryed by the River <HI>Ahava,</HI> till he had got &s;ome <HI>Levites</HI> to go with them.</Q>
And it was even Then ob&s;erved, That places which made Begin|nings any long while without Mini&s;ters, were with mi&s;erable <HI>Un&s;ettlements</HI> broken all to pieces. I &s;up|po&s;e, our Ea&s;tern Country, will &s;hortly again be peopled: But let the people which intend there to Settle them&s;elves, in the Fear of God Remem|ber this Admonition; Don't venture to form <HI>Towns</HI> without the <HI>Go&s;pel</HI> in them any more. If the Lamentable Experience which you have

I ask no more from our Bre|thren who yet Survive the De&s;olations that have come upon their E&s;tates and Neighbours in tho&s;e Plantations, but that they join with the re&s;t of us all, in <HI>Searching and Trying of our ways,</HI> and in <HI>Judging of our &s;elves.</HI> For, alas, <HI>Every mouth mu&s;t be &s;top'd, and all the Land is become Guilty before God!</HI> Let us all then <HI>Enquire,</HI> What may have been tho&s;e <HI>provoking Evils,</HI> for which the <HI>Holy and Ble&s;&s;ed God,</HI> hath given the <HI>Sword</HI> a Commi&s;&s;ion &s;o dreadfully to devour us?

tho&s;e that went before us, might never be too forward in any <HI>Unju&s;tifyable Encroachments,</HI> to po&s;&s;e&s;s and command tho&s;e Lands, which have &s;ince proved &s;o Expen&s;ive unto us? <HI>Older men</HI> then I, are be&s;t able to manage that <HI>Enqui|ry,</HI> though I al&s;o have heard it made. But that whereupon I rather be&s;peak your Thoughts, is This: Will you plea&s;e to <HI>Enquire</HI> into the <HI>Pro|perties</HI> and <HI>Qualities,</HI> of our <HI>Adver&s;aries?</HI> 'Tis po&s;&s;ible, that in their <HI>Properties</HI> and <HI>Qualities,</HI> we may read &s;omething of tho&s;e <HI>Mi&s;carriages,</HI> for which our God, hath Rai&s;ed them up to be our Adver&s;aries.
