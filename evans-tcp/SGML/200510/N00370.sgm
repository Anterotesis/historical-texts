<HEAD>The PLAIN CASE <HI>STATED</HI> Of Old&mdash; but <HI>especially</HI> of <HI>New-England,</HI> in an <HI>Address</HI> to His <HI>HIGHNESS</HI> THE PRINCE OF ORANGE&middot;</HEAD>
<L>HAil noble Prince, in whom our Joy and Love</L>
<L>Unite, and (as to their own Center) move.</L>
<L>In whom those Royal Qualities combine</L>
<L>Which may erect a Second <HI>Constantine.</HI></L>
<L>Among the Songs which <HI>Britain's</HI> joyful dayes</L>
<L>To You present, accept <HI>New-England's</HI> Praise:</L>
<L><HI>VVe</HI> also boast our selves of <HI>English</HI> Race:</L>
<L>And from our Ancestors, who stock't this place,</L>
<L>The name of stricter <HI>Protestants</HI> derive,</L>
<L>And in Your faith and favour hope to live.</L>
<L>We heard, (and it to us did Sorrow bring)</L>
<L>The much-lamented death of the late King;</L>
<L>And, with but too much Truth, did calculate</L>
<L>From thence of all our woes, the wretched Date</L>
<L>Then <HI>James,</HI> with Papal Benediction</L>
<L>And Popish principles assum d the Throne:</L>
<L>A Prince whom Nobler Vertues ne're did yeild</L>
<L>Fitter, the Sceptre of the World to wield:</L>
<L>But to what <HI>Ills</HI> can <HI>Popery</HI> perswade!</L>
<L>And to what <HI>Ruin</HI> do its Maxims lead!</L>
<L>And what a <HI>Hackney</HI> is a <HI>Bigot</HI> made!</L>
<L>Under his umbrage did the Birds of Night</L>
<L>Sing their <HI>damn'd notes,</HI> and sang them with delight;</L>
<L>And Locusts of the Fit, grac't with his Smile,</L>
<L>In swarms invaded our (once happy) Isle.</L>
<L>Heroick <HI>El'sabeth</HI> for us, in vain,</L>
<L>Bafled the fraud of <HI>Rome</HI> and pride of <HI>Spain.</HI></L>
<L>Whilst Jesuited <HI>James</HI> did readvance</L>
<L>The twisted policies of <HI>Rome</HI> and <HI>France.</HI></L>
<L>A <HI>Nuncio</HI> from the old Rogue of <HI>Rome</HI></L>
<L>Must with Applause to <HI>England</HI>'s <HI>Palace</HI> come,</L>
<L>A <HI>Nuncio,</HI> which a Century or more</L>
<L>Of reform'd <HI>England</HI> never saw before;</L>
<L>And we, in grateful sort, must send again</L>
<L>On humble <HI>Embassy</HI> good <HI>Castlemain,</HI></L>
<L>And, by a <HI>Proxy</HI> kiss his Worship's <HI>Toe,</HI></L>
<L>Whence <HI>unknown</HI> streames of <HI>unknown</HI> Blessings flow.</L>
<L>From <HI>Innocent</HI> our plotted Ruin came,</L>
<L><HI>Guilty</HI> in <HI>Fact,</HI> tho <HI>Innocent</HI> in <HI>Name.</HI></L>
<L>From <HI>France's</HI> Don, whose <HI>Papal-Romish</HI> trade</L>
<L>Of Blood and Ruin has such havock made,</L>
<L>That his <HI>one</HI> Persecution has done more</L>
<L>Than the <HI>ten</HI> under pagan-<HI>Rome</HI> before.</L>
<L>From Jesuits a brood, hatch't by the Devil,</L>
<L>To be the Propagators of all evil,</L>
<L>Incarnate Fiends, to Lucifer all, 'd,</L>
<L>And heirs to all his cruelty and pride:</L>
<L>From <HI>these,</HI> our <HI>James,</HI> devoted to the Cause</L>
<L>His Measures took, their Counsels were his Laws:</L>
<L>Our <HI>Sanguinary Laws,</HI> tho' few yet good,</L>
<L>And justly merited by men of Blood,</L>
<L>And those with milder penalties inforc't.</L>
<L>Were with a <HI>Prorogation</HI> indors't.</L>
<L>Those Laws, which Parliaments had made to live,</L>
<L>Were laid in dust by Grand Prerogative;</L>
<L>And <HI>Tests</HI> were useless grown, <HI>Dispensing Power</HI></L>
<L>Disarm'd their Force, that they could strike no more.</L>
<L><HI>Popery</HI> bare-fac't stalk't our injur'd streets,</L>
<L>Justled the Reformation where it meets,</L>
<L>And Cells of <HI>Mass</HI> under our noses grew,</L>
<L>And daring Priests did eagerly pursue</L>
<L>Their Patron's Orders with unbounded joy,</L>
<L>Or to deceive us <HI>Her'ticks,</HI> or destroy.</L>
<L>Dissenting Protestants they strove to please</L>
<L>And wheadle, by a short <HI>delusive</HI> ease.</L>
<L>Th' establish't Church trampled, against all Law,</L>
<L>And, <HI>Jehu</HI>&mdash;like, <HI>drove</HI> where they could not draw.</L>
<L>Whilst Renegado-<HI>Papists</HI> were preferr'd,</L>
<L>And had their King's peculiar Regard.</L>
<L>The Snare was laid, the pointed hour drew nigh,</L>
<L>Wherein our <HI>Name</HI> and <HI>Cause</HI> was doom'd to die.</L>
<L>Great were his <HI>hopes</HI> (who, when the Stroak was gi|ven</L>
<L>Claim'd for <HI>Reward</HI> a <HI>double</HI> share of Heaven)</L>
<L>To sacrifice in one brave funeral Pile,</L>
<L>The numerous HERETICKS of either Isle.</L>
<L>Nor could the Vastness of this damn'd design</L>
<L>The Limits of his Popish Rage confine,</L>
<L>But or'e the Ocean to <HI>this</HI> world it flew;</L>
<L>Reform'd <HI>America</HI> must suffer too.</L>
<L>That <HI>we</HI> were must'red in this bloody Roll</L>
<L>Our <HI>Suffrings</HI> tell (who then could us cajole?)</L>
<L>We, by <HI>Papistick</HI> wiles, may well believe</L>
<L>Were mark't a lingring Ruin to receive.</L>
<L>They grug'd that we should harmlessly possess</L>
<L>With Ease and Freedom this our Wilderness.</L>
<L>Which our religious Ancestors (who fought</L>
<L>God in a Desart Countrey) dearly bought.</L>
<L>Our Charter, which freely we had injoy'd</L>
<L>In three successive Reigns, is first made void;</L>
<L>Condemn'd for forged Crimes we never knew.</L>
<L>Nor at this distance could er'e answer to.</L>
<L>Condemn'd unheard; their fraud would not admit</L>
<L>A clear Defence and Legal; nor was't fit</L>
<L>In a Court where <HI>Astraea</HI> nere' did sit.</L>
<L>And thence were we annex't t' a Popish Crown,</L>
<L>By which we were design'd to be undone.</L>
<L>Then came a man to be our President,</L>
<L>As well against the <HI>Law</HI> as our Content:</L>
<L>But he, Alas, did only smooth the way</L>
<L>For a Superior Lord, who made no stay.</L>
<L>Soon came the <HI>Jersy</HI> Knight, crafty and Stout,</L>
<L>And for his Master s Interest cut out.</L>
<L>Soon did he and his Creatures let us know</L>
<L>Whence all our miseries were like to grow.</L>
<L>Knaves, Beggars, <HI>Papists</HI> form'd the triple League</L>
<L>Which carry'd on the ruinous Intreague.</L>
<L>We were not treated by th' insulting Knaves</L>
<L>As free-born <HI>English,</HI> but as poor <HI>French</HI> Slaves.</L>
<L>Taxes were rais'd, without Mercy, or Measure,</L>
<L>To keep us low, and fill our <HI>Tyrant</HI>'s Treasure.</L>
<L>To MAGNA CHARTA we coul'd claim no Right,</L>
<L>Neither our own, nor <HI>English</HI> Laws would fit,</L>
<L>But such as by Distortion, and Abuse,</L>
<L>Would still advance the Plot to ruin us.</L>
<L>New Laws by a small shabby Juncto fram'd,</L>
<L>And then so surreptitiously proclaim'd,</L>
<L>As if they chose&punc; Oh when were Laws so made!)</L>
<L>They rather should be <HI>broken</HI> than obey'd:</L>
<L>So, if we <HI>kept</HI> or <HI>broke</HI> them, 'twas by chance;</L>
<L>They made advantage of our <HI>Ignorance</HI>:</L>
<L>Strain'd their own Laws beyond their true Intent,</L>
<L>To our great Cost, Sorrow and wonderment.</L>
<L>All that we counted dear was made a Prize</L>
<L>To th' raging Lust and hungry Avarice</L>
<L>Of a few tatter'd Rascals from <HI>New-York,</HI></L>
<L>More insolent than ever was <HI>Grand Turk.</HI></L>
<L>Their debanch't tricks the harmless Countrey saw,</L>
<L>But vainly sought a just redress by Law.</L>
<L>The Law, which ev'n our smallest Trips could find</L>
<L>Distinguish't Friends, and in <HI>their</HI> Cause was <HI>blind.</HI></L>
<L>Their Lust on Honour strange Excursions made:</L>
<L>Their Avarice did our Estates invade.</L>
<L>Our Lands, for which we to the Natives gave</L>
<L>Their <HI>own Demands</HI> these new-come Beggars crave,</L>
<L>Our Lands, which we had peaceably possess't</L>
<L>For Sixty years, they with strange flaws molest.</L>
<L>It would disturb our Father's peaceful Graves,</L>
<L>Saw they their poor Posterity made slaves,</L>
<L>Or knew our Lives or Liberties betray'd,</L>
<L>Or knew our Lands to forreign Foes convey'd.</L>
<L>Yet thus with grief might poor <HI>New-England</HI> cry,</L>
<L>We <HI>our own Lands</HI> with <HI>our own Coyn</HI> must <HI>buy</HI>;</L>
<L>And <HI>Patents</HI> take, or else some sordid Knave</L>
<L>Soon intercepts, and ne<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters"> but <HI>ask and have.</HI></L>
<L>The Secretaries <HI>House of Office</HI> told</L>
<L>(And Courts of Justice) where our Rights were sold,</L>
<L>New Tricks they found, and Fetches with rare skill,</L>
<L>To bring more Grist to their insatiate Mill.</L>
<L>Money we paid, for what we could not know,</L>
<L>Except to Feed their ever-craving maw,</L>
<L>But never full, for fill we might, as well,</L>
<L>As soon the gaping mouthes of <HI>Death</HI> &amp; <HI>Hell.</HI></L>
<L>Law at a price, and Justice we must buy,</L>
<L>Each small Court-Officer gapes for his Fee,</L>
<L>Else Law would be deny'd, and Right delay'd,</L>
<L>Whatever Madam <HI>MAGNA CHARTA</HI> said,</L>
<L>Our <HI>Penal Acts</HI> their <HI>scores &amp; hundreds slew,</HI></L>
<L>Through cursed aid of an informing Crew.</L>
<L>These in our hated Courts did boldly tread,</L>
<L>Villains, who daily damn'd themselves for bread:</L>
<L>Rogues, who for mony (I in plainness think)</L>
<L>Would swear the <HI>Sun</HI> a <HI>bottle full of Ink.</HI></L>
<L><HI>These,</HI> Juries must implicitly believe,</L>
<L>And by <HI>their</HI> Testimonies Verdicts give,</L>
<L>The Sense of <HI>Thinking-men</HI> they must forego,</L>
<L>And, as the Court directs them, blindly do,</L>
<L>Else they're turn'd back, and for their honest Strife</L>
<L>Must forfeit the Conveniences of Life.</L>
<L>Juries were pack't out of their own vile lump</L>
<L>To <HI>serve a Turn,</HI> and <HI>turn</HI> them up a <HI>Trump,</HI></L>
<L>Men of small Sense, and smaller Honesty,</L>
<L>Their knotty roguish Causes to untye.</L>
<L>From Freedom of <HI>Discourse</HI> our Tongues were mor'd,</L>
<L>For we were made Offenders for a word.</L>
<L>When, Mighty Prince, we of Your <HI>Landing</HI> heard&punc;</L>
<L>Tho Hopes &amp; Wishes were on Tip toes rear'd</L>
<L>Yet <HI>we</HI> our Hopes could <HI>whisp'ring</HI> only tell;</L>
<L>And bold was he who dar'd to wish You well:</L>
<L>Him shall I style true <HI>Ben,</HI> who hither came,</L>
<L>To save his Life &amp; an untainted fame;</L>
<L><HI>Harris</HI> was he, whom Parliaments had known</L>
<L>T' have been by Popish rage &amp; frauds undone,</L>
<L>Yet <HI>here</HI> he could not scape the Lion's Paw&punc;</L>
<L>Only for wishing well to <HI>WILLIAM of Nassau.</HI></L>
<L>Our <HI>last</HI> great Grievance, which we could not bear</L>
<L>(With Grief we <HI>tell,</HI> and Oh, with <HI>Pity hear!</HI>)</L>
<L>Was a perplex't mysterious <HI>Indian-War,</HI></L>
<L>For which with mighty Forces we prepare.</L>
<L>We, who a <HI>Hundred,</HI> in the dayes of yore</L>
<L>Could beat a <HI>Thousand Indians</HI> and fight <HI>more,</HI></L>
<L>An Army now a thousand strong must send,</L>
<L>With a poor Handful Hundred to contend;</L>
<L>In horrid Woods where no Provision grew,</L>
<L>Sneaking moneths after moneths to ly <HI>perdue.</HI></L>
<L>Our Officers were Popish men of blood,</L>
<L>Whose Principles could nere consult our Good.</L>
<L>Our Scatt ring Foes but seldom came in sight,</L>
<L>Or if they had, we had no power to fight;</L>
<L>No War was ere <HI>proclaim'd</HI>; what could we do?</L>
<L>We dare not kill, the <HI>Law</HI> would then pursue.</L>
<L>Mean time a tedious <HI>Winter</HI> past our head,</L>
<L>Our Suffrings such, we envy'd ev'n our <HI>dead.</HI></L>
<L>And they not few by sore Diseases went.</L>
<L><HI>Hunger</HI> and <HI>Cold,</HI> and how could this content?</L>
<L>And thus things stood, and thus the Plot went on,</L>
<L>From earth to root our Her'tick Nation</L>
<L>Here, and in our beloved Native Isle;</L>
<L>Till Heaven on us cast a propitious smile;</L>
<L>Piti'd our wrongs and on their Counsels frown'd,</L>
<L>And rais'd a man their Empire to confound.</L>
<L>'Twas YOU, Great Sir, whom Heav'n did elevate</L>
<L>To make more famous this our <HI>Eighty Eight</HI></L>
<L>Than that wherein brave <HI>El'sabeth</HI> did quell</L>
<L>The jointed pow'rs of <HI>Spa<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">n</HI> &amp; <HI>Rome</HI> &amp; <HI>Hell.</HI></L>
<L>YOU, us with gallant Forces did Invade,</L>
<L>(by long Successes formidable made)</L>
<L>Our wishes join d and met our hearts half way,</L>
<L>Whilst Terror seiz'd our popish foes that day.</L>
<L>One bloodless month our happy Nation freed</L>
<L>From popish Plots, by which we fear'd to bleed;</L>
<L>Pounded a crew of mercenary Knaves.</L>
<L><HI>Jesuits</HI> &amp; <HI>Priests,</HI> tools us'd to make us Slaves.</L>
<L>Frighted our stubborn King, who would not part</L>
<L>From his dear <HI>Bantling,</HI> nor his <HI>Bigot</HI>-heart.</L>
<L>Conven'd our Countrey's Representative,</L>
<L>By whose sage Counsels we now hope to live.</L>
<L>This hearing, by Your great Example sway'd,</L>
<L>A <HI>just</HI> Attempt <HI>opprest</HI> New-<HI>England</HI> made,</L>
<L>Not to revenge our wrongs but set us free</L>
<L>From <HI>arbitrary Power</HI> and <HI>Slavery:</HI></L>
<L>This did Heav'n bless, and on our Action smile,</L>
<L>Befool'd our foes, and brought them to the Toyl.</L>
<L>Sir, Your Protection we hope and crave;</L>
<L>Condemn not the Success Your Courage gave.</L>
<L>For this our Songs shall Your brave Triumphs meet,</L>
<L>Laying our Lives and sorunes at Your Feet:</L>
<L>For <HI>this</HI> Your Name will consecrated be</L>
<L>In <HI>English</HI> Hearts to late Posterity.</L>
<L>May still Success Your great Atchievements crown!</L>
<L>Go on to <HI>Conquer,</HI> as You have begun.</L>
