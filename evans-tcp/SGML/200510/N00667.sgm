<OPENER><SALUTE>Mr. Speaker, and you Gentlemen Repre&s;entatives;</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Am very glad to meet you here, according to your Adjournment the la&s;t Se&s;&s;ion. I ju&s;t now heard the Members of <HI>We&s;tche&s;ter County</HI> have ab&s;ented, and hope Mr. Speaker, the Hou&s;e will do that Right to their own Honour to inquire into the Rea&s;on of their Ab&s;ence.</P>
<P>I was call'd to <HI>Albany</HI> this Winter by a double Obligation, my Duty to His mo&s;t &s;acred Maje&s;ty, in di&s;charge of that Tru&s;t he has been graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to put into my hands, and my Affection to his Subjects of that City, who by Addre&s;s de&s;ired my Pre&s;ence with them.</P>
<P>And indeed, the Intelligence of a De&s;ign on that place, by the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">ench</HI> and their <HI>Indians</HI> (being flu&s;ht with their Succe&s;s on <HI>Pemaquid</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>New-England</HI> the la&s;t Summer) was a &s;ufficient &s;pur to me.</P>
<P>I therefore re&s;olved to make <HI>Albany</HI> my Winter Quarter, looking upon it not only as a Barrier to this Province, but to other Colonies of his Maje&s;ties Empire in <HI>America.</HI></P>
<P>My Pa&s;&s;age met with &s;ome Difficulties by an early Winter, being twice drove a&s;hore by the Ice, and at la&s;t lockt up by it; yet I made the Journey in twelve days, though with &s;ome extraordinary Expence, being nece&s;&s;itated to travel part of the way by Land, with a Detach|ment of my own Company.</P>
<P>Coll. <HI>Schuyler,</HI> who commands the Militia in tho&s;e parts, and &s;peaks the Language, was very active in procuring Waggons and other A&s;&s;i&s;tance, (as Sleas for bringing up Field Pieces, &s;mall Arms, Am|munition, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which could not be done gratis.</P>
<P>The Journey had the effect I expected, &s;ome Families who de&s;igned to remove, upon the report of my coming, &s;taid, by which the Gar|ri&s;on was much &s;trengthened.</P>
<P>I ob&s;erved in all the Inhabitants, great zeal for his Maje&s;ties &s;ervice: they were cheerful in the performance of their Duty, watchful and vigilant upon tho&s;e Guards committed to their care.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants are &s;ome-what &s;traitned by quartering his Maje|&s;ties Companys; the Hou&s;es are &s;mall, fitted only for the conveniency of their own Families; if Barrachs were built (which will be no great Charge) the Inhabitants would be ea&s;ed, Souldiers better ac|commodated, De&s;ertion ea&s;ier prevented, and the City better fortified.</P>
<P>And as you have hitherto &s;hewed great regard for his Maje&s;ties Service, in taking care as well for recruiting, as better &s;ub&s;i&s;ting, tho&s;e Companys, &s;o I hope you will continue in the good mind of ea&s;ing the Inhabitants, by accommodating the Souldiers.</P>
<P>Your la&s;t gratuity to them had &s;uch influence, that not one man has de&s;erted &s;ince.</P>
<P>I de&s;ire you'll appoint &s;ome of your Hou&s;e to look into tho&s;e Pay|ments, by which you'll &s;ee, that &s;o much Money as could be got upon the Credit of that Act, has been applyed as it directs. Tho&s;e Recruits from <HI>Connecticut</HI> came very &s;ea&s;onably, they had their levy
<PB N="72" REF="000810_0003_0FAA5739F4F5CCE0">
Money, and tho&s;e two Officers that conducted them were paid One Pound for each man, as a Reward for their Pains and Care, which I hope gave them all Satisfaction.</P>
<P>The W<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">nter &s;eem<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"> the mo&s;t proper Sea&s;on for the <HI>French</HI> to make an attach upon <HI>Albany,</HI> all Rivers, Lakes and Mar&s;hes being &s;o hard by the Fro&s;t that Cannon may be drawn, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Yet in Summer tho&s;e parts &s;uffer mo&s;t by skulking Parties of <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Indians</HI>; &s;o that I mu&s;t recommend to you the care of Recruiting his Maje&s;ties Companys at <HI>May</HI> next (when the time of tho&s;e inli&s;ted by your Act determines) otherwi&s;e it will be impo&s;&s;ible to cover the out Plantations; tho&s;e Farmers will remove, and leave the Country wa&s;te, the con&s;equence of that will be the De&s;olation of the City, which mu&s;t then become a Garri&s;on.</P>
<P>The five Nations of <HI>Indians</HI> can have no Relief there, their Friends being gone, which they may ju&s;tly conclude to be for fear of the <HI>French,</HI> and tho&s;e Indians will then purcha&s;e their Safety and Con|veniency by joyning to our Enemies of <HI>Canada.</HI></P>
<P>The care you have taken for payment of a Party to advance upon the Enemies borders, and lodge there for &s;ome time, to di&s;cover their motion, is of great u&s;e; I hope you will continue that Allowance, and al&s;o con&s;ider the advantage we found la&s;t Summer by the pay|ment of Six Pounds to any <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> or <HI>Indian</HI> for every Head they bring in of tho&s;e skulking Murderers, who &s;pare neither Women nor Children.</P>
<P>By that encouragement we had &s;ome of them cut off in <HI>September</HI> la&s;t. Tho&s;e Gentlemen you have entru&s;ted in the payment of the ad<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">nce Parties, are without doubt <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> for this, being <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> in <HI>Albany</HI>; they &s;hould have a Fund or Credi<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"> to pay for every Head brought in.</P>
<P>The punctual Payment for la<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">ummers Serv<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters"> will &s;pur many Young Men to be Adventurers, both <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> and <HI>Indians</HI>; they'll hunt hard upon this encouragement. I de&s;ire you'll continue Life in &s;o hone&s;t a de&s;ign for the Pre&s;ervation of his Maje&s;ties Subjects in tho&s;e parts.</P>
<P>I cannot be unconcerned at the Hard&s;hips this Province lies under, above others (by rea&s;on of this War.) You have Agents now attending his Maje&s;ty, he is our gracious King, Father of his People, he will hear.</P>
<P>A true and plain Account of our Circum&s;tances will be repre&s;ent|ed, and Relief obtained from his Maje&s;ties pious Care of all his Subjects.</P>
<P>You have &s;een the Memorial given in to their Excellencys, the Lords Ju&s;tices. I have &s;ince received Letters, and another Paper given in by tho&s;e Gentlemen to the Right Honourable, the Commi&s;|&s;ioners for Trade and Plantations. I &s;hall communicate them to your Hou&s;e.</P>
