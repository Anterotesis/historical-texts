<P>BUT in other lights <HI>the day was great.</HI> Our ance&s;tors are not to be repre&s;ent|ed as perfect; but while they were not rude in knowlege, and in doctrinals not inferior to the church of <HI>England,</HI> with regard to piety and virtue they in general de&s;erve an <HI>excellent character.</HI>

For <HI>the great and fearful name of God,</HI> and for the <HI>Lord</HI>'s <HI>day,</HI> their veneration was truly <HI>great.</HI> They di&s;coverd a principle of <HI>&s;trict ju&s;tice,</HI> particularly towards the <HI>natives</HI> of the country. Their <HI>willingne&s;s to communicate</HI> among them&s;elves, re|&s;embled the &s;pirit which prevailed in the primitive church, <HI>when no man &s;aid that ought that he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed was his own; but they had all things common;</HI> a &s;pirit which, in <HI>extraordinary</HI> &s;ituations, may be mo&s;t highly virtuous. They were temperate.</P>
<P>THEY were full in the great prote&s;t|ant principles, concerning the right of private judgment, and making the <HI>word of God</HI> the <HI>only rule</HI> in religion. Their de&s;ire was to <HI>build</HI> not on human inventions, but <HI>on the foundation of the Apo&s;tles and Prophets, Je&s;us Chri&s;t him&s;elf being the chief corner &s;tone.</HI> So far as they adopted the in&s;tructions and &s;pirit of their excellent mini&s;ter, Mr <HI>Robin&s;on,</HI> they were dive&s;ted of bigotry, and friends to free inquiry. They were
<PB N="15" REF="013696_0011_0F91B5D4633E6A48">
zealous advocates for religious liberty. If they have been thought, neverthele&s;s, to have di&s;covered a little too much a&s;perity towards tho&s;e who differed from them in religious &s;entiment, we may be di&s;po&s;ed to make an apology for them, if not to ju&s;tify them, in that regard, when we con&s;ider the exa&s;pe|rating things they had &s;uffered; and how ea&s;y it was for them to judge, that &s;everity was e&s;&s;ential to their pre&s;erva|tion, in their <HI>peculiar</HI> circum&s;tances.

<P>THEIR <HI>de&s;ign,</HI> in coming over to this inho&s;pitable &s;hore, was <HI>great</HI> and hono|rable; to enjoy for them&s;elves and theirs, civil, and e&s;pecially &s;acred free|dom, to wor&s;hip God, without mole&s;|tation, agreably to the dictates of

their own con&s;ciences, to enlarge the Kings dominions, and to pave the way for the conver&s;ion of the <HI>heathen:</HI> They had
<Q>an inward zeal and great hope of laying &s;ome foundation, or making way for <HI>propagating the king|dom of Chri&s;t,</HI> to the remote ends of the earth; though they &s;hould be but as &s;tepping &s;tones to others:</Q>
And they came to remove their child|ren, their po&s;terity, from the &s;nares, oppre&s;&s;ions, and corruptions of the old world; which, however, have been permitted to follow them hither, like <HI>a flood of waters, ca&s;t forth out of the dra|gon's mouth.</HI></P>
<P>THEIR <HI>eccle&s;ia&s;tical plan</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>I have thought proper to in&s;ert it here, as I have taken it from Mr. <HI>Prince</HI>'s Chronology, 91&s;t 92d and 93d pages.</P>
<P><Q>As to <HI>eccle&s;ia&s;tical matters,</HI> they held the fol|lowing articles to be agreable to &s;cripture and rea&s;on.</Q></P>
<P N="1"><Q>1. That no <HI>particular church</HI> ought to con|&s;i&s;t of more members than can convenient|ly watch over one another, and u&s;ually meet and wor&s;hip in <HI>one congregation.</HI></Q></P>
<P N="2"><Q>2. That every particular church of Chri&s;t is only to con&s;i&s;t of &s;uch as appear to believe in, and obey him.</Q></P>
<P N="3"><Q>3. That any competent number of &s;uch, when their con&s;ciences ablige them, have a right to <HI>embody into a church</HI> for their mutual edifi|cation.</Q></P>
<P N="4"><Q>4. That this embodying is by &s;ome certain <HI>contract</HI> or <HI>covenant,</HI> either <HI>expre&s;&s;ed</HI> or <HI>implied,</HI> though it ought to be by the <HI>former.</HI></Q></P>
<P N="5"><Q>5. That being embodied, they have a right of <HI>chu&s;ing</HI> all their <HI>officers.</HI></Q></P>
<P N="6"><Q>6. That the <HI>officers</HI> appointed by <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> for this embodied church, are in &s;ome re&s;pects of <HI>three</HI> &s;orts, in others but <HI>two,</HI> viz.</Q></P>
<P N="1"><Q>(1.) <HI>Pa&s;tors</HI> or <HI>teaching elders,</HI> who have the power both of over&s;eeing, teaching, ad|mini&s;tring the &s;acraments, and ruling too: and being chiefly to give them&s;elves to &s;tu|dying, teaching and the &s;piritual care of the flock, are therefore to be maintained.</Q></P>
<P N="2"><Q>(2.) <HI>Meer</HI> ruling elders, who are to help the pa&s;tors in over&s;eeing and ruling; that their offices be not temporary, as among the <HI>Dutch</HI> and <HI>French</HI> churches, but con|tinual: and being al&s;o qualified in &s;ome degree to teach, they are to <HI>teach</HI> only <HI>occa|&s;ionally,</HI> through nece&s;&s;ity, or in their pa&s;|tor's ab&s;ence or illne&s;s; but being not to give them&s;elves to &s;tudy or teaching, they have no need of maintenance.</Q></P>
<P><Q>That the <HI>elders</HI> of <HI>both &s;orts</HI> form the <HI>pre&s;bytery</HI> of over&s;eers and rulers, which &s;hould be in every particular church: and are in &s;cripture called &s;ometimes <HI>pre&s;byters</HI> or <HI>elders,</HI> &s;ometimes <HI>bi&s;hops</HI> or <HI>over&s;eers,</HI> &s;ometimes <HI>guides,</HI> and &s;ometimes <HI>rulers.</HI></Q></P>
<P N="3"><Q>(3.) <HI>Deacons,</HI> who are to take care of the poor and of the church's trea&s;ure; to di&s;|tribute for the &s;upport of the pa&s;tor, the &s;upply of the needy, the propagation of religion, and to mini&s;ter at the Lord's table, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q></P>
<P N="7"><Q>7. That <HI>the&s;e officers</HI> being cho&s;en and ordain|ed, have no <HI>lordly, arbitrary</HI> or <HI>impo&s;ing power;</HI> but can only rule and mini&s;ter <HI>with the con|&s;ent</HI> of the <HI>brethren;</HI> who ought not in con|tempt to be called the <HI>laity,</HI> but to be treat|ed as men and brethren in Chri&s;t, not as &s;laves or minors.</Q></P>
<P N="8"><Q>8 That no <HI>churches</HI> or <HI>church officers</HI> whatever, have any power over any other church or officers, to controul or impo&s;e upon them; but are all <HI>equal</HI> in their rights and pri|vileges, and ought to be <HI>independant</HI> in the exerci&s;e and enjoyment of them.</Q></P>
<P N="9"><Q>9 As to <HI>church admini&s;trations,</HI> they held, that bapti&s;m is a &s;eal of the covenant of grace, and &s;hould be di&s;pen&s;ed only to vi&s;ible believers, with their unadult children; and this in primitive purity, as in the times of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> and his <HI>Apo&s;tles,</HI> without the &s;ign of <HI>the cro&s;s,</HI> or any other invented ceremony: that the <HI>Lord's &s;upper,</HI> &s;hould be received as it was at fir&s;t even in Chri&s;t's immediate pre&s;ence, in the <HI>table po&s;ture:</HI> that the el|ders &s;hould not be re&s;trained from praying <HI>in public</HI> as well as private, according to the various occa&s;ions continually offering from the word or providence, and no &s;et form &s;hould be impo&s;ed on any: that <HI>excommunication</HI> &s;hould be wholly <HI>&s;piritual,</HI> a meer rejecting the &s;candalous from the communion of the church in the holy &s;a|craments, and tho&s;e other &s;piritual privi|leges which are peculiar to the faithful: and that the church or it's officers have no authority to inflict any penalties of a <HI>temporal</HI> nature.</Q></P>
<P N="10"><Q>10. And la&s;tly, as for <HI>holy days,</HI> they were very &s;trict for the ob&s;ervation of the <HI>Lord's day,</HI> in a pious memorial of the incarnation, birth, death, re&s;urrection, a&s;cention and benefits of <HI>Chri&s;t;</HI> as also <HI>&s;olemn fa&s;tings</HI> and <HI>thank&s;givings,</HI> as the &s;tate of providence re|quires: but all other times not pre&s;cribed in &s;cripture they utterly relinqui&s;hed: and as in general, they could not conceive any thing a part of Chri&s;t's religion which he has not required; they therefore re|nounced all human right of <HI>inventing,</HI> and much le&s;s of <HI>impo&s;ing</HI> it on others.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The&s;e were the <HI>main principles</HI> of that &s;criptu|al and religious liberty, for which this people &s;uffered in <HI>England,</HI> fled to <HI>Holland,</HI> traver&s;ed the ocean, and &s;ought a danger|ous retreat in the&s;e remote and &s;avage de|&s;arts of <HI>North-America;</HI> that here they might fully enjoy them, and leave them to their la&s;t po&s;terity.</Q></P></NOTE> was, in the

If &s;uch things are not prevented, <HI>honor</HI> will be too apt to alight on tho&s;e for whom it is not <HI>&s;eemly: power</HI> will be too apt to fall into the hands of tho&s;e, who want the under&s;tanding or the heart to make a good u&s;e of it: there will not be proper encouragement for the geniu&s;es, which the <HI>God of nature</HI> &s;catters promi&s;cuou&s;ly among the people; hope of ri&s;ing will be cut off; laudable and u&s;eful emulation will be cramped: there will not be that exer|tion for liberty, which may be &s;een, where there are great numbers of freeholders in a country, who have real e&s;tates to pre&s;erve un|embarra&s;&s;ed: bribery in elections (if any &s;uch things as elections remain) will take place more ea&s;ily and &s;ucce&s;sfully, than it would if the number of freeholders was very great: there will not be &s;uch a &s;pur to in|du&s;try, as where men have a pro&s;pect of ob|taining good farms, for them&s;elves and for their children: a great part of the people will be very poor, and therefore ignorant, irreligious and vicious; they will be untaught to read, or they will have but little lei&s;ure for reading the <HI>word of God,</HI> or other u&s;eful writings; they will be callous and in&s;en&s;ible; the friendly in&s;tructions and warnings of the patriot's pen, will not reach their under&s;tand|ings and hearts; they will be low lived, mean &s;pirited and &s;ervile in their tempers, and they will be &s;laves.</P>
<P>We a&s;k leave to &s;ubjoin, that in&s;tead of endea|voring to keep the people in ignorance, and under hard bondage, under a pretence of it's being nece&s;&s;ary for keeping them in order, and to prevent their ruining them&s;elves; rulers, of any kind, if they would act the truely human and chri&s;tian part, &s;hould &s;trive to enlighten them as far as po&s;&s;ible; and, leaving them in the enjoyment of their liberty, endeavor to correct their morals, and bring them to <HI>choo&s;e</HI> that re&s;pectfulne&s;s and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to regular government, in which their intere&s;t will forever be involved.</P>
<P>The care that has been taken to &s;upport more public or more private <HI>&s;chools</HI> in <HI>New-England,</HI> is high prai&s;eworthy; and we hope there will, in time to come, be much larger room for commendation, in this re&s;pect.</P></NOTE></P>
