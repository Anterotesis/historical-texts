<Q><BIBL><HI>Isai. 66.2.</HI></BIBL>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THis Chapter and the foregoing contain the last and conclud|ing Sermon of this Prophet, in the <HI>publick Audience</HI> of the <HI>Jews,</HI> or that did concern and was proposed to the <HI>General Body</HI> of that People. in which Discourse the Lord does by the Pro|phet declare the <HI>Removal</HI> of the Glory and of his Kingdom from <HI>them</HI> to <HI>another</HI> People: and withal mentions their particular sins, and their Obstinacy in them; for which he would thus deal with them in re|moving <HI>from</HI> and rejecting <HI>of</HI> them. But yet notwithstanding to evidence his Love and Faithfulness to this people that had been so near him, and that he had so graciously manifested Himself <HI>to</HI>: the Lord promises to <HI>preserve a Remnant</HI> in this calamity, whom He would follow with signal favours where ever they should be cast, and reserve to better times. In the finishing and making up of his Prophecy the Prophet intermixes many things by way of <HI>Comfort</HI> to the godly, and <HI>Threatning</HI> to the wicked under all the great Revoluti|ons of Providence that should happen in the accomplishment of what was here fore-told. And because this people of the <HI>Jews</HI> both good and bad did too much confide in the Temple and the external Rites and Ordinances of God's worship attended among them: while in the mean time they were not suitably spirited nor did suitably carry themselves. The Prophet in the beginning of this Chapter beats them off from that carnal confidence, and shews them the true way of obtaining and <HI>re</HI>-taining Divine Favour, declaring that it would be vain Confidence to rest in any external signs of Gods prescence or
<PB N="2" REF="000381_0003_0FA4FEB36A9F1648">
what of Gods order had been, or <HI>was</HI> among them. This was a <HI>Theme</HI> that has been alwaies so distasteful a <HI>subject,</HI> so hard to be taken down by a visibly professing people under spiritual declen|sion and defection, that some Expositors conclude that it was for this very Prophecy, that the people procured the Prophet <HI>Isaiah</HI> to be put to death. And we know that <HI>Stephen</HI>'s reciting and im|proving this passage in the <HI>first,</HI> and <HI>this</HI> verse, was in great part&punc; cause of that rage the <HI>Jews</HI> expressed against him, <HI>Act.</HI> 7.49, 50, 54. <HI>As saith the prophet, Heaven is my throne and earth is my footstool: what house will ye build me, saith the Lord? or what is the place of my rest&punc; Hath not my hand made all these things? &mdash; When they heard these things, they were cut to the heart, and they gnashed on him with their teeth.</HI> But the more hard such words are to be born, the more need there is that they should be spoken,; and therefore the Prophet faithfully delivers this message from the Lord, <HI>ver.</HI> 1. <HI>Thus saith the Lord, The Heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool: where is the house that ye build unto me, and where is the place of my rest?</HI> To beat down the vain confidence of the <HI>Jews,</HI> as if because Gods Temple was among them, therefore He could not go from them: The Lord here holds forth and asserts to them his incomprehensible greatness&punc; <HI>Heaven is my throne and the earth is my footstool</HI>: He filled Heaven and earth with his prescence, yea Heaven and the Heaven of Heavens could not contain Him: He is not included <HI>in,</HI> or confined <HI>to</HI> any place: Hence He demands <HI>Where is the house that ye build unto me, and where is the place of my rest?</HI> This Demand imports in general, that there could be no house built that should hold or contain God, wherein He might rest and repose Himself: And in particular, up|braids them with imagining that the great GOD was confined <HI>to,</HI> or detained <HI>in</HI> the Temple, as an Idol in some Cell or house framed for it; as if He could find no rest any where else but there. Its true, The Temple was a great Help Priviledge and Advantage to them; as it was a means of Gods Worship, and sign of Gods Prescence among them&punc; but they fondly supposing God to be <HI>bound</HI> to them thereby, made it of a <HI>help</HI> to become a <HI>Hindrance.</HI></P>
<P>In the Text we have 1. What God had done, expressed by way of <HI>Concession</HI> or affirmative <HI>Relation</HI>: which as things past, could give no security for future Good: <HI>For all those things hath my hand made, and all those things have been, saith the Lord.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. What God <HI>would</HI> doe, expressed by way of promise, which might
<PB N="3" REF="000381_0004_0FA4FEB4478B9078">
be constantly and certainly depended upon: <HI>But to this man will I look, even to him that is poor and of a contrite spirit and trembleth at my Word.</HI></P>
<P>Concerning the former part of the words, there a rise two Que|stions:</P>
<P>QUST. I. <HI>What is the Antecedant to the Relative</HI> those, <HI>those things which its said God had made, and that they had been?</HI></P>
<P><HI>ANSW.</HI> Some refer it to the <HI>Heaven</HI> and <HI>Earth</HI> mentioned in the beginning of the first verse. Them, and whatsoever is contained in them, all the works of Creation which we behold, above or below, in the Sky or Heavens, or on the earth. Others refer it to the <HI>House</HI> that had been built unto God, that had been the place of His rest <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Temple</HI> mentioned in the latter part of the first verse. it is not inconsistent or impossible but <HI>both</HI> may be referred to, having been just before both mentioned, and the repeating of the Relative is not unlikely, but doth intimate so much; <HI>All those things hath My hand made,</HI> viz. the works of Creation. <HI>And all those things have been,</HI> viz. that have pertained to my Temple, House, Rest and Abode among you.</P>
<P>QUEST. II. <HI>What is the scope and drift of these words, to what end are they thus exprest? [For all those things hath mine hand made &amp;c.]</HI></P>
<P><HI>ANSW.</HI> They may import either</P>
<P N="1">1. Seeing that God is HE who has given being to all things, one and another, He cannot be supposed to have any need <HI>of,</HI> to receive be|nefit <HI>by,</HI> or be engaged <HI>unto</HI> Man for any service he hath done Him&punc; And so they respect and may be joyned with the following words af|ter this manner, <HI>q. d.</HI> Although I who AM the Authour and Crea|tor of all things whatsoever, cannot therefore need or be engaged to any creature, yet I will condescend to shew grace to such who are of a truly humble mind, and do <HI>fear</HI> before Me. My Greatness shall not hinder Me dwelling <HI>with,</HI> and regarding the lowly in spirit. Or else</P>
<P N="2">2. It may be as if the Lord should say. Its true My Temple&punc; My House, My Rest, My Worship, Order and Ordinances have been among you: <HI>All these things have been</HI>: But the bare <HI>Being</HI> of these is no certain Sign of My continuing Presence and Favour&punc; There may be many things that may drive Me away, notwithstanding all that may have been of this nature: But here I give you a certain mark by which you may try and be assured of My Favour&punc; <HI>Viz.</HI> if <HI>these</HI> following properties be found in you; That you be
<PB N="4" REF="000381_0005_0FA4FEB4E2C98868">
poor, contrite in spirit, and tremble at My Word. <HI>But to</HI> this <HI>man will I look, even to him that is poor, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>I shall a little open this latter part of the words,</P>
<P><HI>But to this man</HI>] scil. To every such man, man or woman; and therefore to any Company or Society of such men as shall be so spi|rited; To any people that are in such a frame. What agrees to <HI>Individuals,</HI> will also agree to the <HI>whole</HI> that is made up of such Individuals.</P>
<P><HI>Will I look</HI>] Verbs of Sense denote also suitable and proportion|able affections. It imports therefore To look with favour and ac|ceptation, to respect, regard, take notice and take care of, to accept with good Will, to embrace with Favour and Love. So <HI>Exod.</HI> 2.25. <HI>God</HI> looked <HI>upon the children of Israel, and God had</HI> respect <HI>to them</HI>&punc; Numb. 16.15. <HI>Moses was very wroth and said to the Lord,</HI> respect <HI>not thou their offering.</HI> Psal. 11.7. <HI>His countenance doth</HI> behold <HI>the up|right.</HI> Amos&punc; 5.22. <HI>Your meat-offerings I will not accept, neither will I</HI> regard &mdash; which is the same word with this here in the Text.</P>
<P><HI>Even to him that is poor</HI>] The word sometimes signifies those which are outwardly poor and afflicted, and such frequently is the conditi|on of those in this world who find most Favour with God. But here it is to be understood of such who are <HI>spiritually</HI> poor, or poor in their own sight and esteem, <HI>poor in spirit,</HI> as they are called <HI>Mat.</HI> 5.3. that think modestly, lowly, meanly of themselves. They are meek and humble&punc; that feel their need of divine answers to their cries, and of divine Help. All men indeed are poor in spiritual regards, but it is the man that does duly <HI>sense</HI> his spiritual poverty, who un|derstands himself to <HI>be</HI> and bears himself as a poor man, that is here meant. <HI>Qui nihil altum de se sapit.</HI> His heart is not haughty, nor his eye lofty, and he feels and believes that there is no cause they should.</P>
<P><HI>And of a contrite spirit</HI>] The word properly signifies <HI>smitten in spi|rit,</HI> and intends one whose heart smites him for his Sins and sinful|ness, whose spirit is grieved and wounded under his guilt and pol|lution, who is in bitternes by looking on his <HI>Lord whom he has pierced by his sins,</HI> and his heart yeilds and falls under the Lords threatning <HI>of,</HI> and sentence <HI>against</HI> his sin.</P>
<P><HI>And trembleth at my word</HI>] i. e. That hath a filial fear of God wrought in his heart by the Word, so as to stand in aw of the Word and with Reverence to receive and attend it. This Trembling (ac|cording to the use of the word [<HI>Hharad</HI>] imports</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="5" REF="000381_0006_0FA4FEB79E186050">1. An Aw of the Word of God: that it <HI>commands</HI> &amp; <HI>stills</HI> the heart, that there is a fear of the threatnings, a fear of incurring the penalty of unbelief <HI>of</HI> and disobedience <HI>to</HI> the Word; A fear of neglecting the Commands and losing the Reward proposed in the Word. <HI>Amos</HI> 3.6, 8. <HI>Shall a trumpet</HI> (to which the voice of the Lords Pro|phet convincing of sin by the word is compared <HI>Isai.</HI> 58.1. Lift up thy voice like a trumpet, and shew my people their transgression.) <HI>be blown in the City and the people not be afraid? The Lion hath roared</HI> (i. e. the Invincible irresistable GOD hath threatned judgment by His word) <HI>who will not fear?</HI> It is expected such Reproofs and Threatnings by the word should work an Aw.</P>
<P N="2">2. A careful solicitude to attend the Direction and Prescript of the Word of God. To give it due entertainment, to have it flourish and prosper. In this sence the word is used, 2. <HI>King.</HI> 4.13. <HI>Behold thou hast been</HI> careful <HI>for us with all this care.</HI> It is such a trembling, not as makes men fly from God, but as makes them most careful to subject to the will of God revealed in his Word, as makes them busie themselves to perform, and doe what Gods Word requires.</P>
<P N="3">3. A making hast to attend the commands of Gods Word. Make|ing speed without delay to obey the word of God as that which we are afraid to put off or neglect at all. So the word sometimes signi|fieth to <HI>run in haste</HI> or <HI>to run in fear</HI> or <HI>with trembling.</HI></P>
<P>Thus God here gives the character of those whom He will in favour and mercy look to or upon. And this is to be understood as exclusive of all others, <HI>scil.</HI> that they are these only that God is engaged thus to look upon. He has something else to say to those of a contrary spirit and frame. <HI>Psal.</HI> 138.6. <HI>Though the Lord be high, yet hath He respect to the lowly, but the proud he knoweth afarr off.</HI> And this the <HI>Seventy</HI> do directly point to in their rendring this latter clause thus, <HI>Ki epi tina epibiepso all' e epi ton <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">apeinon &amp;c. And upon whom should I look but upon [or unto] him that is poor &amp;c.</HI> And I have seen an old <HI>English</HI> Translation that renders the words in like manner. <HI>q. d.</HI> Whom else can it be thought I should regard with Favour and set My heart upon, but such as are here characterized? But these I will.</P>
<P>Whence we may observe;</P>
<P>DOCT. <HI>That whatever may have been the great Works of God in the World, or his signal Dispensations toward any people, yet the standing Tryal of a person's, and so a peoples Acceptation with God, is their being of a poor and contrite spirit, and trembling at His Word.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="000381_0007_0FA4FEB8CA62FF20">See this further confirmed <HI>Isai.</HI> 57.15. <HI>For thus saith the High and Lofty One that inhabiteth Eternity whose Name is HOLY, I dwell in the High and Holy place, with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the Humble and to revive the heart of the contrite ones.</HI> Hos. 14.3. <HI>In Thee the fatherless findteh mercy.</HI> Prov. 3.34. <HI>He giveth grace to the lowly.</HI> Psal. 51.17. <HI>The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit, a broken and a contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise.</HI></P>
<P>I shall endeavour to lead you to the plain and clear understanding of this Truth, by these following Conclusions.</P>
<P>Concl. I. <HI>All the great Things done in the world, they are the work of God.</HI> His hand has made and framed the whole Fabrick of Heaven &amp; Earth. He hath hung out the Globe of this World; hung the Earth upon nothing; drawn over the Canopy of the Heavens; laid the foun|dation of the earth in its place; Created that Fountain and Center of Light, Heat, &amp; Influence in this lower World, the <HI>Sun</HI>; together with all the lesser light Bodies, which are for Times, for Signs &amp; for Seasons, the <HI>Moon</HI> &amp; <HI>Stars</HI>; and He hath set &amp; settled the Ordinances for them all. <HI>Psal.</HI> 102.25. <HI>Of old hast thou laid the foundation of the earth, &amp; the Heavens are the work of thy hands.</HI> Jer. 31.35. <HI>Thus saith the Lord, which giveth the Sun for a light by day, and the Ordinances of the moon &amp; of the stars for a light by night; which divideth the Sea, when the waves thereof roar; The Lord of Hosts is his Name.</HI> The Seas, the vast Mountains also, and the Wind so undiscernable in its motions, and other strange Meteors, they are His Work. <HI>Amos</HI> 4.13. <HI>For lo, He that formeth the mountains and createth the wind, and declareth un|to man what is his thought, that maketh the morning darkness, and treads upon the high places of the earth: the Lord, the God of Hosts is His Name.</HI> Job: 37. with 38. Chap. The continued Creation of those Beings that are ever coming <HI>up,</HI> and going <HI>off</HI> the Stage of this world, by a perpetual, orderly Succession and propagation, they are also His Work. <HI>Psal.</HI> 104. The whole Administration of Providence in the Upholding and Government of all created Beings, in a way of highest Wisdom and exact Order, it is <HI>all</HI> His work. All great Revolutions, signal and remarkable Dispensations, Things beyond the ordinary Course and power of Nature, or such as do shew forth the highest strains of Wisdom, Power, Grace or Justice, He doeth them all. <HI>Psal.</HI> 74.12, &mdash; 17. <HI>For GOD is my King of old, working salvation in the midst of the earth.

brakest the heads of the dragons <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span">. Thou brakest the heads of the Leviathan in pieces, and gavest him to be meat to the people inhabiting the Wilderness. Thou didst cleave the foun|tain and the flood: thou driedst up mighty rivers. The day is thine, and the night also is thine, thou hast prepared the light and the Sun. Thou hast set all the borders of the earth: thou hast made summer and winter.</HI> Those notable changes in the World in the promoting or suppressing, exalting or bringing down of King|doms, Nations, Provinces or Persons, they are all wrought by Him. Psal. 75.6, 7, 8. <HI>For promotion cometh neither from the East, nor from the West, nor from the South. But God is the Judge, He putteth down one, and setteth up another. For in the hand of the Lord there is a cup, &amp; the wine is red: It is full of mixture, &amp; He poureth out of the same.</HI> Ezek. 17, 24. <HI>And all the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">es of the field, shall know that I the LORD have brought down the high tree, have exalted the low tree, have dried up the green tree, and have made the dry tree to flourish: I the LORD have spoken, and have done it.</HI> The Yearly seasons, also Seed-time and Harvest, Summer and Win|ter, binding up and covering the earth with Frost, Ice and Snow, and the releasing and renewing of the face of the Earth again, it's His work. <HI>Psal.</HI> 147.15, 18. <HI>He sendeth forth His Commandment upon earth; His Word runneth very swiftly. He giveth Snow like wool, He scattereth the hoar frost like ashes. He casteth forth his ice like morsels, who can stand before His cold? He sendeth out His Word and melteth them: He causeth His wind to blow and the waters flow.</HI> Psal. 104.29, 30. <HI>Thou hidest thy face they are troubled: Thou takest away their breath, they dye, and re|turn to their dust. Thou sendest forth thy spirit, they are creat|ed: and thou renewest the face of the Earth.</HI> These as all other great works whatsoever, they are the Lords. Nothing is done without Him. <HI>Lam.</HI> 3.37. <HI>Who is be that saith and it comes to pass, when the LORD commands it not?</HI> Psal. 136.4. <HI>To Him, who alone does great Wonders.</HI> Hence in consideration of this, let the Lord's People say as they, <HI>Jex.</HI> 14.22. <HI>Art thou not He, O LORD our GOD? therefore we will wait upon thee: for</HI> Thou <HI>hast made all these things.</HI></P>

He hath not dealt so with any nation.</HI> He not only prospers them in the World above others, but makes known and gives forth more of Him|self as to visible Dispensations and outward meanes and advan|tages for Heaven than He does to others.

And since the Apostles dayes, some Nations, and several coun|treys and Bodies of People have been by Divine Dispensation not only priviledged with the Gospel; but God hath to ma|ny places and people wrought wonderfully for the bringing of it to, or settling them under the enjoyment of it, or for the Continuance of it to them. Ecclesiastical history may give us many instances of this nature. And we in <HI>New-England</HI> (who should if God perswade us so, look upon our selves as less than the least of all God's sincere people) have been behind but few in the signalness of God's dispensations to us in these respects as this Place, and these Solemnityes have often born us witness. I mean not only, that the solemnityes themselves have been witnesses, but also that upon them, frequent, plain and full Reports have been made of the Lords wonderful and gracious dealings with this people. <HI>Ps.</HI> 77.14.15.19.20. and 111.6. <HI>He hath shewed his people the power of his works: that He may give them ye heritage of the heathen.</HI></P>

Its true, the Lord doth sometimes visibly bless the righteous, and blast the wicked; but this is not so constant and perpetual, as that any man can meerly from hence infallibly know love or hatred to be in God to him by all that is before him.

Men may (and would to God there were none here that did so!) live under the most clear Gospel Light, in the pure, peaceable, free Enjoyment of Gospel Order and Ordinances, be obliged by manifold Kindnesses from God, themselves have great Know|ledge in Religion, and make high profession with much Cri|ticalness therein; and yet live in some sin openly or secretly, be enslaved to some base defiling lust, wherewith they may not only pollute themselves, but others also. Let the Heaven hear and the Earth give ear, let them be astonished at it, be hor|ribly afraid, and be very desolate, for it may be found that they whom God hath nourished and brought up as His child|ren, do rebel against Him; that the Lord's own people do for|sake Him the Fountain of living waters, and goe to empty or muddy Cisterns: As the Lord emphatically complains of <HI>them</HI> in <HI>Isai.</HI> 1.2. and <HI>Jer.</HI> 2.12, 13. Priviledged professors, Pro|fessors in <HI>New-England</HI> may be discovered to be sinners; some to be proud, haughty, high-minded, supercilious, self-exalting, arrogant; others to be sensual, intemperate, corrupt, fleshly, lascivious; some to be Company-keepers, to sit and spend time with vain persons; others to be covetous, unjust, oppressing, defrauding and over-reaching others; some to be revilers, rai|lers, ungoverned in their speeches and expressions; others to be despisers of that which is good, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Moreover, There may be under such Enjoyments, Grievous and horrible Neglects, receiving the Grace of God (in Gospel offers and means of Salvation) in vain; Woful formality and slightiness in holy Duties, men not stiring up themselves to seek GOD, resting in <HI>a name to live</HI>: Carnal confidence in priviledges and former visible enjoyments of Divine Favour, <HI>Jer.</HI> 7.4.

And the Lord by His Prophets told <HI>Jerusalem</HI> and <HI>Judah,</HI> and according as He foretold, so He executed upon <HI>Jerusalem</HI> and <HI>Judah,</HI> that they are an Instance for the proof of this Propo|sition: They had received much from God, none <HI>more</HI> in their day, yet through their sin lost all the signs and tokens of God's favour, and fell under the severe effects of His displea|sure. As their case is lamentably described, and you may read in <HI>Lam.</HI> 2.3. &mdash; 9.

Tho' Priviledges will not, yet there are

Qualifications which will infallibly evidence special Favour. We need not be at a loss if we will consult and study the Di|vine Will, what wee may depend upon for His Acceptation and Salvation. The spiritually wise do understand, and the prudent do know these things; what course is to be taken that they may stand before the Lord, have His presence <HI>with,</HI> and grace <HI>towards</HI> them. If men be so qualified as the Word of God declares and requires; He will save them from trou|ble, or at least He will be with them when in outward trou|ble, and support them therein; and He will everlastingly save them.

<P>Concl. 5. <HI>The standing tryal of a person's and so a peoples Ac|ceptation with God, is their being of a poor and contrit spirite, and trembling at His Word.</HI> The Text is plain and peremptory for this, from the Lords own mouth: What is signified by these expressions, was shown in the opening of the words.

Contrition and lowliness of spirit, there is requisite the sense and acknowledgement.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Of the infinite Distance and Disproportion that is betwixt GOD and them.</HI> That they are wormes to the LORD. <HI>Psal.</HI> 22.6. <HI>But I am a worm.</HI> If the nations be as the drop of a bucket and as the small dust which wo'nt turn the Ballance, <HI>Isai.</HI> 40.15. what then is a small handful of people, and what are single persons to Him?</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Of their Guiltiness and Pollution by Sin.</HI> The heart of the contrite-spirited person smites him, and is wounded for his sin, as its contrary to God's Will and Holiness.

<P N="3">3. <HI>Of their Vnworthiness to receive the least favour and mercy from God.</HI> Genes. 32.10. <HI>I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies, and of all the truth which thou hast shewed unto thy servant.</HI> Luke. 15.19. &mdash; <HI>and am no more worthy to be called thy son.</HI> Look themselves through and through, they can find nothing to build any claim upon to the smallest mercy.

<P N="3">3. <HI>He humbly accepts of</HI> offer'd <HI>Mercy by a Mediator and Surety.</HI> To be beholding to Him for <HI>all,</HI> and to <HI>take</HI> all upon <HI>His</HI> Ac|count. He looks for Merit and Righteousnes that may procure him good <HI>els-where,</HI> feeling he hath none in himself: And there|fore he prizes exceedingly the Hope set before him, which he flees to. <HI>Luke.</HI> 18.13. <HI>He would not so much as lift up his eyes to Heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying, God be merciful to me a sinner.</HI> Which <HI>mercy</HI> to a <HI>sinner</HI> can be only through Jesus Christ the Mediator. Thus a backsliding people when humbled, pray the Lord's Favour for his Names sake. <HI>Jer.</HI> 14.7. <HI>O Lord, tho' our iniquities testifie against us, doe thou it for thy</HI> Names sake, <HI>for our back-slidings are many.</HI></P>

<P N="1">1. Because <HI>It is the Lords's Free will and good pleasure.</HI> This is the bottom cause He is pleas'd thus to doe wonderfully. <HI>Mat.</HI> 11.25, 26. <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> and hast revealed them unto babes: even so

<P N="2">2. Because <HI>These do most truly respect the Lord.</HI> Therefore will the Lord so accept and look upon them, above others. The poor have their eyes <HI>unto</HI> and <HI>upon</HI> the Lord, and therefore the Lord will have <HI>His</HI> eyes upon <HI>them.</HI> In them there is the most free and open passage for the Lord to come into their souls with all His Power, Authority, Sovereignty, Glory and Grace. True Contrition, Humiliation and Poverty of spirit opens the heart to God to let Him in, to come and do all for the soul as belongs to a God to doe&punc; but on the Contrary, Height of Spirit and Unbrokenness of heart with-holds that due respect from God, and so barrs His so full passage <HI>into,</HI> full possessi|on <HI>of,</HI> and dominion <HI>over</HI> the soul. And God hath said, that as men are disposed and carry to Him, so he will carry Him|self to them: And therefore He will regard and save the afflicted and humble people. <HI>Psal.</HI> 18.25, 26, 27. <HI>With the merciful thou wilt shew thy self merciful, with an upright man thou wilt shew thy self upright, with the pure thou wilt show thy self pure, and with the froward thou wilt shew thy self froward For thou wilt save the afflicted people, but wilt bring down the high looks.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. Because <HI>These do most gladly look</HI> to, <HI>and depend</HI> upon <HI>the Me|diator, in whom God is well pleased.</HI> Whence they thus improv|ing and honouring Him, God hath a gracious respect to them for His sake.</P>
<P N="3">III. <HI>How God doth look upon and accept the humble and lowly.</HI> It is with special and peculiar Grace: He looks Favourably on them. Such are the greatest Favourites in the Kingdom of Heaven. <HI>Mat.</HI> 18.4. <HI>Whosoever therefore shall</HI> humble <HI>himself as this little child, the same is</HI> greatest <HI>in the Kingdom of Heaven.</HI> He takes pleasure in them. <HI>Psal.</HI> 147.11. <HI>The Lord</HI> taketh pleasure <HI>in them that fear Him.</HI> He will instruct them. <HI>Psal.</HI> 25.9. <HI>The meek will He guide in judgment, &amp; the meek will He</HI> teach <HI>His way.</HI> He will communicate His grace to them <HI>Jam.</HI> 4.6. &mdash; <HI>but gives</HI> Grace <HI>to the humble.</HI> He will dwell with them. <HI>Isai.</HI> 57&middot;15.

This has not been fully and practically acknowledged by us, which yet hath been due from us. <HI>Mal.</HI> 1.6. A son honoureth his Father, and a servant his Master: If then I be a Father, where is my honour? and if I be a Master, where is my Fear? saith the Lord of Hosts unto you that despise my Name.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Hence, We have taken to our selves more than our Right.</HI> More than becomes (not so much creatures, as) those who profess utmost Reverence, Subjection, Obsequiousness <HI>to,</HI> and Dependance <HI>upon</HI> the Lord our Creator and Redeemer, as we have done. 1. <HI>Cor.</HI> 4.7, 8. &mdash; <HI>why dost thou glory as if thou hadst not received it?

<P N="1">1. <HI>Hence it is that we have no more</HI> duly <HI>sought God.</HI> Hence we have sought Him</P>
<P><HI>No more fully according to His Order.</HI> There has been much Ig|norance and Mistake <HI>in,</HI> and <HI>about</HI> the things of God's House and Kingdom. Some Ordinances of Christ laid by, and thrown aside by many; if not despised and reproached. Too much baulking also of known Institutions and Commands: Men have not been willing throughly to subject themselves to God's Ordinances and Institutions, especially when any thing of their own hath come at any time to be thwarted by them. <HI>Inst. gr.</HI> It hath been too much in <HI>New-England,</HI> that the Discipline of Christ in His Chur|ches hath been in great part neglected; or attended according as it suited <HI>with,</HI> or happened to the humours, affections, inter|ests or relations of some men, and so the Ordinance of Christ that ought to be attended and administred without partiality, pro|strated to mens lusts.</P>
<P><HI>No more sincerely and uprightly</HI>: But with so much Formality Hypocrisie, carelesness and indifferency in the Ordinances that have been attended. And all neglect of seeking God at all, or in due order it arises from pride. <HI>Ps.</HI> 10.4. <HI>The wicked through the pride of his countenance will not seek after God.</HI> Though not alwayes from the pride of a wicked person, but sometimes from unmortified pride in a righteous man.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Hence we have been contentious.</HI> The wise man tells us what is the only cause of Contention. <HI>Prov.</HI> 13.10. <HI>Only by</HI> pride <HI>comes contention.</HI> And how much of this, together with the evil con|comitants of it, Jealousies, reproaches, Slanders, Alienations of spirit &amp;c. has there been in Churches and other Societies! The Remembrance of those woful Contentions that have been in many Churches, may justly humble us this day; as also the Dissentions, Heart-risings and counter-actings, that have been in Courts and civil Assemblyes, while we were otherwise at quiet. Oh how high have we been in our Contests <HI>with,</HI> and Cen|sures one of another! And it is lamentable to consider, what Mis-understandings, Jealousies, Animosityes, Prejudices and evil eyes have been between Rulers and People, or some among either.

On which side in our late Differences of apprehension about the management of publick affairs, which did rise so high, there was most blame, I shall not affirm. Only I wish that every one, of whatsoever Opinion or Apprehension, might be sen|sible of every particular wherein they have been out of the way and too blame, in that or any other controversy, which has at any time unhappily spread among us. It is not so much differ|ence of apprehension (that is common to men and the best of men in this world about Circumstantials and non-fundamentals) as vehemency and bitterness of spirit, and the like evils arising from, and accompanying such differences (which sucks away the vital spirits of Gospel charity) that has wounded us. What|ever provocations therefore there may have been at any <HI>Massah</HI> or <HI>Meribah</HI> of ours, let every one concerned take heed that he do not suffer any bitterness of spirit then taken, to ly and rankle into any Malignity on one side or other; for I intend not one more than another: But earnestly desire that all the Lord's servants, however for some time, through temptation falling out; yet will in the end show themselves to be true Children of peace and lovers of Condescention. <HI>Rom.</HI> 12.16.18.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Hence we have been acted by Self-Interest.</HI> It is sad when it may be said of a Christian people, or any of those among them that have the care or conduct of publick Administrations, as <HI>Phil.</HI> 2.20.21. <HI>I have no man like minded, who will natural+ly care for your state. For all seek their own, not the things which are Jesus Christ's.</HI> When some private Interest of their own, their own Advantage, Preferment, Fame and Reputation or the like, shall carry them off <HI>from,</HI> and make them stand in the way <HI>of</HI> that which is truly for the publick good in Church or State. And this is the want of humility, when we prefer any Inte|rest of ours, or make it to justle with the Lords. And would to God we had not cause to lay our hands upon our breasts upon this account! Let all the Lords servants whom he has any way imployed in His work in whatsoever capacity, faithfully examine themselves in this matter: when this or that hath been before them that would really have been beneficial for the pub|lick, has not some such Thought; <HI>I shall lose by this; Some way of advantage that I have had will be hereby stopt.</HI> or, <HI>I shall be

I make no particular Application or Instance here, I know good men have their failings, and those who in gene|ral do truly seek the Interest of Christ, may yet in this or that particular be too much swayed by private interest, and we must not presently cashier them (especialy if otherwise men of worth and use) because of this. But I heartily wish that those scales of self-interest and affection, which blind the eyes of many men, might wholly fall from the eyes of all you whom the Lord hath or shall any way improve in his service in this <HI>Israel,</HI> and from the eyes of every Christian.</P>
<P N="4">4. Hence <HI>we have born too high a sail.</HI> That there hath been an affectation of Gallantry unbecoming our condition, hath been long complained <HI>of,</HI> and many times testified against in this place and on these occasions, and that I believe rationally. But its most apparent that this hath exceedingly grown upon us of latter times, and is accompanied also with <HI>sufficient,</HI> if not much too great delicacy of living, wherein we abuse our mercyes God hath given us. Further, it is not improbable but that some for whom Providence hath favourably and honourably cast their Lot may have been under temptation to have their hearts lifted up above their Brethren; through the gales of Popular applause, or an overweening esteem of their own worth or the Largness of Divine Bounty to them in any remarkable Dispensation, or the like; to make too much of themselves, &amp; it may be too little of others; overlooking, neglecting, or too much imposing.

Finally, let it not be offensive if I mention it as a thing worthy of Consi|deration, Whether this Government or the Persons managing it; have not in some instances born themselves too high, assumed more than God hath given them full ground for: and if it should be so, no doubt but that they have been a provocation, and no wonder if God threaten to bring you low.</P>
<P N="5">5. Hence <HI>We have not been subject to Order and Government, civil, ecclesiastical or domestical.</HI> We have been a Corporation that have lived too much in the violation of our own Laws: Of some good Laws we have been too high to bear the Execution of them at the hand of our Neighbours, whether such as were called to see them observed, or such as would secure themselves by them: There has been to much of a lawless, ungovern'd spirit. And for the true Order and Government of Christ in His Church, <HI>that</HI> hath been in some places little practised, in some much withstood, and in others quite overthrown, whilst power and Government hath been fixed in those that should be ruled, and only a liberty to lift up their hands left to the Rulers, and together therewith other Ordinances of Christ have been undervalued and abused. And as for Fa|mily-Government and Order, <HI>that</HI> is in a great Measure lost in <HI>New-England,</HI> as those who undestand what it is, do too too sensibly complain.</P>
<P N="6">6. Hence <HI>We have set other things in the place of GOD.</HI> We have left God and our <HI>first love</HI> to Him. Through want of true poverty of spirit, we have not maintained that constant feel|ing sense of our need of Him, and so have suffered our selves to de|cline and go away from Him, away from that strict and close dependance and communion which was sometimes in Christians. We have not been so earnestly careful to ly alwaies in the arms

of a Gracious Saviour under the full expressions of His Love, but have been slothful and slumbering in carnal rest and ease, hard and loth to be awakned and stirred up to open to Christ and let Him fully in to our souls, as the Spouse. <HI>Cant.</HI> 5.2, 3. &mdash; <HI>the voice of my Beloved that knocketh, saying, open to me &mdash; I have put off my coat, how shall I put it on? I have washed my feet, how shall I defile them.</HI> And our hearts have gone after some other thing, some <HI>new</HI> love, some vanity or other, which we have entertained, embraced and set in God's place: and these we have Idolized, set our hearts upon them, and given more than their due to them. Thus we have done to the World, we have fallen down to that, and that hath lifted us up in our minds, wherein we have violated that solemn caution God left with His People to be minded by them when in a rise|ing condition in the World. <HI>Deut.</HI> 8.12.13, 14. <HI>Beware lest when thou hast eaten and art full, and hast built goodly Houses, and dwelt therein: And when thy Herds and thy Flocks multiply, and thy Silver and thy Gold is multiplied, and all that thou hast is mul|tiplied: Then thy heart be lifted up, and thou forget the Lord thy God.</HI> Truly here is our main wound, and the great cause of God's Controversie with us, that we are declined and gone off so much from God, from the life and power of Grace and Godliness, from keeping our hearts and walking with God; and have suffered other inferior things to take up, fill and take away our hearts. <HI>Rev.</HI> 2.4. <HI>Nevertheless</HI> (notwithstanding all that was commendable among them, in purity of Doctrin &amp; Wor|ship, and travel in God's work and service) <HI>I have somewhat against thee because thou hast left thy first love.</HI> These inward soul-declensions and decayes, and goings off of the heart from God, were very offensive to him: as <HI>Ezek.</HI> 6.9. <HI>Because I am broken with their whorish heart which hath departed from me, and with their eyes which goe a whoring after their Idols.</HI> In like man|ner, it is not unlikely, but we have abused the most glorious priviledges of the Gospel here afforded, to be in some degree and too much haughty because of God's holy Mountain. <HI>Zeph.</HI> 3.11. So does want of true humility and poverty of spirit expose us to abuse the best things. And if there be any other particular wherein this people have incurred like guilt, I had
<PB N="26" REF="000381_0027_0FA4FECCE8CA8CF8">
much rather they should take notice of it themselves than hear it from mee. Whatever it be that men have their eyes upon, whether any thing they suppose in themselves, or any thing that hath been done for them, or any priviledge bestowed up|on them, these cannot give them rest and security in God's Favour, and it will be an error to have recourse <HI>to,</HI> or depend <HI>upon</HI> them for divine Protection, while we neglect true humility poverty of spirit and trembling at God's Word. There is ma|ny a tall <HI>Eliab,</HI> that even some <HI>Samuels</HI> may think to be assu|redly favoured of God, which yet God will reject: But the true spirit of <HI>David</HI> which we have in <HI>Psal.</HI> 131. <HI>Lord my heart is not haughty &amp;c.</HI> He never will reject.</P>
<P N="7">7. Hence, <HI>We have been Impatient of Reproof; though necessary, orderly, and without Reflection.</HI> Too much uncircumcised in heart and ears, resisting, or turning away from the Holy Ghost speaking to us <HI>in,</HI> and <HI>by</HI> his Word. The form of Religion, to ma|ny lifted up therewith, is (as One speaks) a <HI>Buff Coat</HI> to their sins, to turn the sharpest reproofs that can be levelled against them. It was so with that people, <HI>Zech.</HI> 7.11.12. <HI>They refused to hearken and pulled away the shoulder, and stopped their ears that they should not hear, yea, they made their hearts as an Adamant stone, lest they should hear the Law, and the words which the Lord of Hosts hath sent in His spirit by the former Prophets.</HI> And we have reason to acknowledge &amp; be humbled that it has been too much so with us; that so much unwillingness <HI>to,</HI> impatience <HI>of,</HI> and in|corrigibleness <HI>under</HI> the Reproofs of God's Word, hath shown it self among us.</P>
<P N="2">II. Consider <HI>What we have</HI> suffered <HI>for want of this humble spi|rit.</HI> This hath been the procurer of all our sorrows, that we have been no more humble and submissive unto God. For this we have been threatned: It was said upon a like Occasion, now twelve years agone,

Whether the whole of what God intended by

and like words, be come upon us, is yet a question: but much we have suffered, which we may justly reckon to this account: God has brought many of our fears upon us, because we have been too high to answer His Calls, and we know not what He may doe more therein. <HI>Isai.</HI> 66.4. &mdash; <HI>and will bring their fears upon them, because when I called none did answer, when I spake they did not hear, but they did evil before mine eyes, and chose that in which I delighted not.</HI> God hath drawn out His sword against us, and hath given it a charge to devour round about our Coasts, and many have fallen down slain by it. God hath blown upon the Labour of our hands, by Blastings, Flouds, Droughts, and losses by Ship-wrecks and otherwayes; and of what hath remained he hath found out continual waies for dis|bursment, to make and keep us empty. God hath sent sore Sicknesses and Pestilential diseases upon us which have sorely wasted us. God hath again and again contended by terrible Fires, which have eat up a great part of our pleasant Enjoy|ments. He has also frustrated our expectations and hopes ma|ny wayes: as it is <HI>Jer.</HI> 8.15. <HI>We looked for peace but no good came; and for a time of health, and behold trouble.</HI> Now all these things God hath done to humble us; for we are His covenant People: we have not been therefore humble enough. The Lord's goodness would not have suffered Him to doe thus, if our <HI>badness</HI> did not force Him to it <HI>Jer.</HI> 9.7. <HI>Therefore thus saith the Lord of hosts, behold, I will melt them, and try them: for how shall I doe for the daughter of my people? q. d.</HI>
<Q>What other course can I take but this according to the nature of man?

Attrib. page.</HI> 657.</NOTE> Its when the impurities and unhumbledness of His people necessitate Him to this proceeding, that God sits as a Refiner and brings hum|bling dispensations upon them.</Q>
All that we have suffered and been threatned with, it has been but necessary for us; <HI>less</HI> would not bring us to tremble <HI>before</HI> God, and <HI>in</HI> our selves: And Oh that <HI>this</HI> might!

For this re|al poverty and contrition of spirit and trembling at God's Word is to be found no where else, but where true grace is, and where the spirit of Christ dwels and Rules.

<P N="1">I. Motive. <HI>Consider the disadvantage of being without this spi|rit.</HI> In several respects,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>The Word you hear will doe you no good.</HI> Pride is an ene|my to profiting.
<Q>It is observed that the ground whereon the <HI>Peacock</HI> that proud bird sits, is barren: the heart where Pride sits is barren.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Watson.</HI></NOTE></Q>
The Word must be received in meekness, that it may be savingly efficacious. <HI>Ja.</HI> 1.21. While men remain in the pride and unhumbledness of their hearts, whatever their professions be, and whatever they may <HI>doe,</HI> the best counsels &amp; cautions will not work kindly upon them. A People will never be brought to do their business throughly with God, in com|pliance with His Word, till they be brought to such a trem|bling frame. <HI>Ezra.</HI> 10.3. <HI>Now therefore let us make a covenant with our God, to put away &mdash; according to the counsel of my Lord, and of those that</HI> tremble <HI>at the Commandment of our God, and let it be done according to the Law.</HI> There must be an awful, sanctify|ing, reverential, fiducial fear in all our Transactions with God, otherwise they will be but formal, Hypocritical, vain and lu|dicrous; there will be no good effect of the Word of God up|on us.

But it is expres|ly declared, that his soul which is lifted up, is not upright in him. <HI>Hab.</HI> 2.4.

plainly, closely, solemnly and frequently. Neither will the Word spoken go down with an unhumbled people, unless it be such as suits them, they not so much desiring that their <HI>wills</HI> should be brought to the <HI>Word,</HI> as that the <HI>Word</HI> should be brought to their <HI>wills.</HI> A sad Instance we have of this <HI>Jer.</HI> 43.1.2. <HI>And it came to pass, that when</HI> Jeremiah <HI>had made an end of speak|ing unto all the people all the words of the Lord their God, for which the Lord their God had sent him to them even all these Words&punc; Then spake</HI> Azariah <HI>the son of</HI> Hoshaiah, <HI>and</HI> Johanan <HI>the son of</HI> Kareah, <HI>and all the</HI> proud <HI>men, saying unto</HI> Jeremiah, <HI>thou speakest falsly; the Lord our God hath not sent thee to say, goe not &amp;c.</HI> Notwithstanding their solemn profession. <HI>Chapt.</HI> 42.5, 6. Then they said to Jeremiah, The Lord be a true and faithful wit|ness between us, if we doe not even according to all things for the which the Lord thy God shall send thee to us, whether it be good or whether it be evil, we will obey the voice of the Lord our God to whom we send thee, that it may be well with us, when we obey the voice of the Lord our God.</P>
<P N="2">2. This will make men that <HI>they will not be afraid when God is displeased with themselves or others</HI>: When sin is committed or Judgement threatned. <HI>Jer.</HI> 36.23.24. <HI>And it came to pass, that when Jehudi had read three or four leaves, he cut it with the penknife, and cast it into the fire that was on the hearth, until all the roll was consumed in the fire that was on the hearth, yet they were not</HI> afraid, <HI>nor rent their garments, neither the King nor any of his servants that heard all these Words.</HI> This is from an in|ward stoutness and unsubduedness of heart. Hence many a professor, can be loose in his walk; formal and slighty in Re|ligious duties; careless of the Sabbath; indulge his corruptions; comply far with some sins of the times; neglect the trust and charge committed to him: and yet his heart not smite him, the thoughts hereof do not trouble him, nor make him afraid. And this is a dangerous thing.</P>
<P N="3">3. This will <HI>expose us to Misery and Destruction.</HI> If we should have no other Molestation come upon us any way, yet if we be without this spirit of awful fear and trembling before God, we shall be like enough quickly to sink in our own ruines, under the weight of our pride and other corruptions. <HI>Jer.</HI> 44.10, 11.

GOD has not been wont to prosper any People long, however good they were, or however good their cause were, if their spirits have been high, and so shown more of themselves, than of the spi|rit of Christ, as it is too often with God's people. So true is it which the Holy Ghost saith, <HI>Prov.</HI> 29.23. <HI>A mans pride shall bring him low.</HI> and <HI>Chapt.</HI> 16.18. <HI>Pride goeth before de|struction; and an haughty spirit before a fall.</HI> If <HI>Hezekiah</HI>'s heart be lifted up, there is a Dispensation of wrath near. 2. <HI>Chron.</HI> 32.25. &mdash; <HI>for his heart was lifted up, therefore there was wrath upon him, and upon Judah and Jerusalem.</HI> The loftiness of man shall be made low, God will have it so. <HI>Isai.</HI> 2.11.17. <HI>The lofty looks of man shall be</HI> humbled, <HI>and the haughtiness of men shall be bowed</HI> down, <HI>and the Lord alone shall be exalted in that day. For the day of the LORD of Hosts shall be upon every one that is proud and lofty, and upon every one that is lifted up, and he shall be brought low, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. Mot. Consider <HI>the Advantage of being of this poor, con|trite and trembling spirit.</HI> It will be exceeding beneficial many wayes.</P>
<P N="1">1. This will dispose you <HI>to acknowledge and sanctifie the Name of God under all Dispensations</HI>: under all visitations: To see and own how God is fulfilling His Word; making good His threat|threatnings;

And it was broken in that day: and so</HI> the poor of the flock <HI>that waited upon me</HI> knew <HI>that it was the Word of the Lord.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. This will dispose you <HI>to that Mourning and weeping which we have now need to attend upon God with.</HI> We have reason to make this day, yea these dayes wherein God is afflicting us; and these years wherein we are seeing evil, to be times of Mourning and Sor|row.

<P N="3">3.

Much hath been plainly spoken from God to this people again and again: God hath told us his mind fully, what He would have us doe, and where our life lies Deut. 32.46, 47. <HI>Set your hearts unto all the words which I testifie among you this day, &mdash; for it is not a vain thing for you: because it is your life.</HI> And if we had but this spirit that I am now pleading for, we should then be ready to rise up to doe the words of the Lord, which we have heard from Him and thereupon to engage in a saving and last|ing work of Reformation.

<P N="5">5. This will dispose us to <HI>Patience and enduring under all Suffer|ings.</HI> The heart that is not truly broken and meek'ned, finds it harder to comport with, and bear quietly that which is con|trary to him without flinching one way or other; either on the one hand by succumbing and yielding to the Temptation; or on the other, by disorderly flying out beyond his Duty.

<P>For a Close of this Discourse, this Doctrine and Exhortation may by a particular Application be proposed</P>
<P N="1">I. To <HI>Rulers: Such as are yet betrusted with the Charge of this people.</HI> Honoured and much esteemed! You are hence exhorted.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>To Labour for a large measure of this spirit of humbleness of mind and meekness in your selves.</HI> You need it to make You meet for your work, that You may be accepted therein of God and men. There are other things indeed that may buoy You up in the favourable opinion of men, for some time; but there is nothing can give You a lasting room in the hearts of wise and good men like this. But that which is more, this only can give You a standing under <HI>Divine</HI> Favour and Ac|ceptation; and of this you need a great degree, especially un|der the circumstances of the present Time, to bear all the Con|flicts, Hardships and Discouragements You meet with. When God chose a man to lead his people in a Wilderness of Diffi|culties, Dangers, Sufferings and Temptations, He chose <HI>Moses</HI> the meekest man in all the earth; one able, through the in|timacy of his acquaintance with God, to bear things intolera|ble unto others: And yet notwithstanding even <HI>Moses</HI>'s spi|rit was sometimes too much provoked. What need then have You to be eminent in this respect, to be beyond exception for true Gospel-Humility and subjection to the Word of God, to be wholly mortified to <HI>Self,</HI> to the Pride, Vanity, Profit, Ex|cess, Grandure and Love of the World.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="37" REF="000381_0038_0FA4FEDFB6CFD470">2. <HI>To labour to promote this spirit and frame in the People <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> Your charge.</HI> If God continue You that are <HI>from among ourselves</HI> in this Trust; Your faithful endeavours in this matter will still be expected. Remember that You rule not only over men, but over a People of <HI>God,</HI> (though indeed too sadly declined and degenerate) and therefore You are to take care to manage them so as may set and leave them under the highest degree of Divine Acceptation; that is to be as humble and trembling under the word of God as may be. What therefore may be done to convince <HI>of,</HI> and deter and recover this people <HI>from</HI> Sin of all kinds: and what may be done to encourage, Draw on <HI>to,</HI> and settle this People <HI>under</HI> a careful attendance to all good works in the Reverential fear of God; This is Your Wor<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">&punc; In which the LORD guide, prosper, and long continue You.</P>
<P N="2">II. This Exhortation may be proposed <HI>To the Lord's ser|vants in the Ministry.</HI> Fathers, and Brethren, suffer this word of Exhortation from the unworthiest of your Order, or rather from your Lord Jesus Christ: <HI>Shew your selves Patterns,</HI> as in other things, so <HI>in the Humility, and meekness of your spirits,</HI> the con|trition and brokenness of your hearts, awful trembling at God's Word, and <HI>in</HI> the Administration of His Worship, and <HI>labour</HI> to <HI>promote this frame in the Lord's people,</HI> by shewing them their sins in the vileness &amp; desert of them, &amp; by setting before them the Ma|jesty and Glory of God. When God hath eminently improved suc|ceeded and honoured to the last any of his servants in the work of the Ministry, He hath given them a good measure of His Spirit. Our Work is <HI>to receive the Word</HI> from God's mouth, and to <HI>give His people warning</HI> from Him: To both which a large mea|sure of this spirit is necessary; so much as is not easily or presently attained. It was some <HI>time</HI> before <HI>Elijah</HI>'s spirit at <HI>Horeb</HI> the mount of God, was sufficiently prepared to an awful regard of the Divine presence, and to the receiving the Lord's message. First a great and strong Wind rends the mountains, breaks in peices the Rocks before the Lord: after the wind an earth-quake, and after the Earth-quake, a Fire: and after all these the Lord appears in a small still voice, and then <HI>Elijah</HI> wraps his face in his mantle, and in that awful posture receives the

mind of God. 1. King. 19.11, 12, 13. To <HI>Isaiah</HI> the Lord appears in such glorious manner as makes him cry out, Woe is me, for I am undone, because I am a man of unclean lips; and then He <HI>gives</HI> him and sends him upon his special errand to his people. <HI>Isai.</HI> 6. This spirit also is needful for the due deli|very of the Lords mind to His people. 2. <HI>Tim.</HI> 2.24, 25. <HI>The servant of the Lord must &mdash; be gentle, &mdash; patient, in meekness in|structing &amp;c.</HI> Whatever message we have; whether of Mercy or Judgment, our souls should be feelingly and heart-breakingly concerned for those to whom we speak. In the discharge of our Trust, as we are special servants of Jesus Christ, we should have much of His spirit, who could not denounce Judgment against <HI>Jerusalem</HI> without many tears and heart-breakings for them. <HI>Luk.</HI> 19.41, 44. <HI>And when he was come near, he beheld the city, and wept over it, saying, If thou hadst known even thou, at least in this thy day, the things which belong unto thy peace! but now they are hid from thine eyes. For the day shall come upon thee, that thine enemies shall cast a trench about thee, &amp;c.</HI> I need not say what present cause there is for the Lord's faithful Watch-men to be alike deeply affected for <HI>Zion.</HI> And in all our Administrations we should be carried forth with a full sense of our own weakness and unworthiness. What a nothing does the great Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> make of himself in the whole of his ministerial conversation! <HI>I laboured more abundantly than they all; yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me.</HI> 1. Cor. 15.10. <HI>In nothing am I behind the very chiefest of the Apostles, though I be nothing.</HI> 2. <HI>Cor.</HI> 12.11.</P>
<P N="3">III. Finally, this Exhortation is proposed <HI>to all the People of the Land.</HI> You are a professing People, and do something in Religion externally; but all your Profession, and all that you doe, will signifie and come to nothing, if this spirit be wanting.

sometimes that under a Zeal for the Lord's work and glory grows insensibly upon them, notwithstanding their converse <HI>with,</HI> and constant attendance <HI>upon</HI> the Lord, insomuch that they doe hence expose themselves to the Lords rebuke. <HI>Luk.</HI> 9.54, 55. <HI>And when his Disciples James and John saw this, they said, Lord, wilt thou that we command fire to come down from Heaven, and consume them, even as Elias did. But he turned and rebuked them, and said, ye know not what manner of spirit ye are of.</HI> O therefore look to your hearts, take heed to your spirits, that there be no Pride, Loftiness or sinful Discomposure lodging there. La|bour to be within that promise which makes over the great Blessing of the Kingdom of Heaven; of Comfort, and an In|heritance on the earth to the poor in spirit, that mourn and are meek. <HI>Mat.</HI> 5.3, 4, 5. As for your outward concerns, those of this Day and the like, seeing you have opportunity, and so long as you shall have opportunity to be managing of them, I wish you may shew your selves meek, humble, patient, self-denying, forgiving supposed errors and wrongs: Laying aside inconveni|ent or unreasonable disgusts; not leting Anger to rest in your bo|somes; and that however God may further try you in these things, that a spirit of patience and quiet submission to any such Dispensation as is according to God's Will, may ever possess you, while you both render to <HI>Caesar</HI> the things which are <HI>Caesar</HI>'s, and to God the things which are God's. But your great busi|ness is with <HI>God,</HI> and the most proper advice I have to offer therein is,</P>
<P>Get <HI>and</HI> be <HI>of a poor and contrite spirit and trembling at the Word of God.</HI> Let your hearts come down and lye low before God and as the sheep of His hand hear his voice <HI>Psal.</HI> 95.6, 7, 8. <HI>O come let us worship and bow down let us kneel before the Lord our maker. For he is our God, and we are the people of His pasture and the sheep of his hand: to day if ye will hear his voice harden not your heart as in the provocation and as in the day of temptation in the Wilderness.</HI> It is hardness and haughtiness of mens hearts that makes all Di|vine Exhortations ineffectual. Oh beware of it in the least degree of it! Consider what God hath done to stain the glory of all flesh: He will have no flesh to glory in his presence. Consider <HI>the ax is now laid to the root of the tree.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span">. If we will

not lower to bring forth the fruit of true Humiliation and Re|pentance, we shall be laid low, even to the ground: But those that tremble when the Ax is at the root of the tree, when Judg|ment is gathering in the Cloud, God will look to <HI>them,</HI> that the Ax shall not cut <HI>them</HI> down, nor the storm sweep them away. God will be to them a <HI>Sanctuary.</HI> Isai. 8.13.14. <HI>Sanctifie the Lord of hosts Himself, and let Him be your fear, and let Him be your dread, and He shall be for a sanctuary.</HI> And they shall have rest in the day of trouble, either by escaping, or having full support under it. <HI>Hab.</HI> 3.15, 16. <HI>Thou didst walk through the sea with thy horses, through the heap of great waters. When I heard, my belly trembled: my lips quivered at the voice: rottenness entred into my bones, and I</HI> trembled <HI>in my self, that I might</HI> rest <HI>in the day of</HI> trouble. We should therefore stand trembling before God under the sense and apprehension of present and impending Dispensations, but more especially under the sense of whatsoever evils have kindled the Lords Displeasure, and made Him threaten a De|parture from us <HI>Ezra.</HI> 9.4. and 10.9.</P>
<P>Let our whole Course, Garb, Guise, Converse and Spirit speak Humility and Humiliation in so humbling a time as this is. <HI>Carry it in all things as becomes a poor and an afflicted people.</HI> I am sure you will be thereby better Disposed to trust in the Name of the LORD, and have firmer ground to believe in His Sal|vation.</P>
<P>The Subject therefore I have been discoursing is, I trust through Grace a suitable word from the Lord, as I was desired to pre|pare for this Occasion. I have not designed to <HI>gratifie</HI> or <HI>grieve</HI> any, have aimed to speak what may fall upon the consciences of us all, as we are more or less guilty: and I fear we have been guilty in this thing, one way or other, most of us, of whatsoever Opinion or Ap|prehension. Oh that we might now lift up our selves no more! That we might now lay our hands upon our mouths, and put our mouths in the dust, if so be there may be hope! Famous, remarkable and admirable might the Lord's providential operations then be for as in the eyes of others; as well as comfortable to our selves. <HI>Isai.</HI> 14.2. <HI>What shall One then answer the messengers of the nations?
