<P>ALtho it hath been fully proved that <HI>Qua|kerism</HI> is <HI>Paganism</HI>; nevertheless, one that appears sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ely in Print, as an Advocate for the <HI>Qu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">kers,</HI> with a most Remarkable Ingenuity goes to demonstrate, That the Name of <HI>Chri|stians</HI> belongs unto the <HI>Quakers,</HI> inasmuch as the Etymology of that worthy Name agrees unto them; he Learnedly tells us, the true Name is XPI&Sgr; TI-ONO, which is in English, <HI>Christs Asses</HI>; &amp; <HI>such</HI> he says, they be, <HI>while they patiently undergo all manner of Reproaches and Revilings. I</HI> am willing to accomodate that Au|thor, with granting him the two latter sylla|bles of the <HI>Name</HI> which he seems to challenge for himself and his Friends.

<P>Nevertheless I cannot account my self here|by Released, from any proper Endeavours to <HI>Antidote</HI> my Neighbours against the venemous and contagious Heresies of <HI>Quakerism.</HI> I re|member that <HI>George Keith</HI> somewhere bids us <HI>Turn our minds to the Light within us, wherewi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h Christ has enlightned all men,</HI> and points at this as a way to be saved from <HI>mistakes.</HI> I do then solemnly declare, that I have seriously <HI>Turned unto that Light,</HI> and with the best of my <HI>light</HI> as yet, I can see many <HI>damnable Heresies</HI> in <HI>Quakerism</HI>; if I have (as the <HI>Quakers</HI> own <HI>all</HI> have) one spark of <HI>Light</HI> in me, <HI>Quakerism</HI> is but a profound and a deadly <HI>Pit of darkness.</HI> I look upon <HI>Quakerism,</HI> as a <HI>snare of the Devil</HI>&punc; wherein many are <HI>taken alive by him at his will</HI>; and I were very uncharitable, if I should not labour to rescue my Friends out of such an un|doing <HI>Snare</HI>; a meaner Creature than the mea|nest Owner of Reason, must have our Help against a <HI>Pit</HI> less Dangerous than that of <HI>Qua|kerism.

<P>Our Blessed Religion is wonderfully suited un|to our constitution, by laying before us both <HI>sensible</HI> and <HI>spiritual</HI> objects to converse withal; but <HI>Quakerism,</HI> under the pretence of advancing the <HI>Spiritual</HI> Objects of Religion, goes to annihi|late all the <HI>Sensible</HI>; so that we must have no <HI>Bi|ble,</HI> no <HI>Jesus,</HI> no <HI>Baptism,</HI> no <HI>Eucharist,</HI> no <HI>Or|dinances,</HI> but what shall be so Evaporated into Mystical Notions, as to become unto the Chil|dren of Men, altogether unintelligible, or at least unprofitable. Indeed, there is hardly any one Fundamental Article of that Reformed Re|ligion, whereby we look to be saved, that is not undermined by <HI>Quakerism,</HI> whatever professions it makes unto the contrary, when, <HI>An Angel of Light,</HI> is to be personated. What Re|ligion shall we have, if the <HI>Scriptures,</HI> once come to be vile in our opinion of them?

us, <HI>It is the greatest error in the world, and the ground of all errors, to say, The Scriptures are a Rule to Christians</HI>? The Quakers in their Books expresly challenge us, <HI>Tell me one Scripture that hath light in it,</HI> And at the same time entitle their own books, <HI>Light risen out of Dark|ness.</HI> They expresly reproach men for, <HI>Doting on the Scriptures</HI>; and at the same time their own silly Scribles they call <HI>The Shields of the truth,</HI> and <HI>Things written from the spirit of the Lord,</HI> Hence as Mr. <HI>Cheiny</HI> tells us, in their Disputes the <HI>Quakers</HI> openly have said, <HI>God has no where commanded us to walk according to</HI> the <HI>Scriptures.</HI> Thus when Mr. <HI>Cotton</HI> of <HI>Ply|mouth,</HI> with some others, had attested, that they heard <HI>George Keith</HI> affirm, <HI>The Scriptures are the word of God,</HI> this <HI>Keith</HI> Prints a letter to revile the witnesses, for, <HI>Not Dealing Fairly, nor as becomes true witnesses.</HI> Now let any reaso|nable man, find any reason of their thus treat|ing the Holy Scriptures; what can this caution signify? if they would not have us think, that we pay too much Respect unto those <HI>Oracles</HI> of God. <HI>A</HI> Crime which I assure you, few among us are guilty of!

Bible. <HI>I</HI> say we cannot vomit out such Blasphe|mies, and yet we think that wonderful Book, our <HI>Bible,</HI> has not a due estimation with us.</P>
<P>It would be more <HI>tedious</HI> indeed, than <HI>useful</HI> for me to Transcribe the many other horrible passages, which continually fall from the Pens of the greatest <HI>Rabbi's</HI> among the <HI>Quakers,</HI> and such as have most pretended unto <HI>Inspiration</HI> among them; but you shall find the Books of their most <HI>admired Apostles</HI> fill'd (if I may speak the Truth) with most <HI>admirable Blas|phemies.</HI> They begin to speak somewhat wari|ly in their later Catechisms; but what cen|sure have they hitherto passed upon one of their Authors, who twits us in the Teeth, with, <HI>Our imagined God beyond the Stars</HI>; or, one of their Authors, who tells us, <HI>Your car|nal Christ is utterly denied by the Light</HI>?</P>
<P>When did they deal with <HI>Whitehead</HI> for cal|ling it a LYE, <HI>To say, the Scripture is the means by which Fai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h is wrought?</HI> or for saying in a Book signed by <HI>him</HI> and three other Qua|kers, pretending to answer, a worthy Mini|ster, <HI>Thou blind Beast, thou that sayest that the Scriptures reveal God, Thou art a Lyar</HI>?

three distinct Gods?</HI> Have they testify'd against the same Ingenious, tho Heretical Writer, for saying, <HI>Justification by that Righteousness, which Christ fulfilled in his own Person without us, is a Doctrine of Devils</HI>? or have they chastised their <HI>Farnworth,</HI> for saying, <HI>What Righteousness Christ performed without me, was not my Justification, neither was I saved by it</HI>? What Retractation have they advised unto their <HI>Fox,</HI> when he had written, <HI>He is deceived, who saith God is Distinct from the Saints?</HI> Have they thought Mr. <HI>Pen</HI> worthy to be mended, for saying, <HI>Either the Re|surrection of the Body, must be without the mat|ter, or it must not; if it must, then it is not that same Numerical Body, and so their proper and strict taking of the word,</HI> Resurrection, <HI>they must let go; if it must not, then I affirm it cannot be Incorruptible</HI>; for in such a manner does he oppose the Doctrine of the <HI>Resurrection</HI>?

out of <HI>William Smith</HI>'s Forge, in the year 1665) also deride men, for saying in their <HI>Prayers,</HI>
<Q>They are miserable Sinners, and they do those things they ought not to do?</Q>
Is not this the Reflection there made upon it.
<Q>And if so, then not Believers; for they that believe in Christ, are not miserable sinners, neither do those things they ought not to do. In that which they call, The Lords Prayer, they ge|nerally say, <HI>Our Father</HI>; Now the Children of God are not miserable Sinners; nor do not those things they ought not to do?</Q>
And as to <HI>Prayer,</HI> is not this the Conclusion there made of all,
<Q>All must cease from their own words, and from their own time, and learn to be silent, until the Spirit gives them ut|terance?</Q>
The sense of which, if you would know, you must fetch it from the horribly <HI>prayerless Lives</HI> of the <HI>Quakers.</HI> How many prayerless <HI>Houses,</HI> and prayerless <HI>Tables,</HI> are to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ound among the best of them! Some of them have confess'd, <HI>That they never pray with|out an inward motion from the Spirit; and that in many years, they have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> had a motion to prayer.</HI> See <HI>J. C</HI>'s Call to prayer, <HI>page</HI> 97. Thus do these Blasphemers, charge their own <HI>pride,</HI> and <HI>sloth,</HI> and <HI>wickedness,</HI> upon the Eternal Spirit of God!</P>
<P>I say, until the <HI>Quakers</HI> do disown and re|prove such Expressions as these, they must par|don us, if we look upon these Expressions to be but the <HI>Explications</HI> of what they <HI>mean,</HI> when
<PB N="9" REF="000563_0011_0FA70DECDB22A3D8">
they <HI>speak</HI> with more subtilty in their <HI>Confessi|ons</HI> which they make, when they are charged with being <HI>No Christians</HI>; and indeed their <HI>Confessions</HI> are mostly so worded as to admit of these <HI>Explications.</HI> If the Quakers do <HI>sincerely</HI> intend as my Charity obliges me to <HI>think</HI> and <HI>hope,</HI> that many of the <HI>Seduced</HI> may <HI>honestly</HI> in|tend, no more than they <HI>declare</HI> in some of their later <HI>Catechisms,</HI> it is a prognostic where|at I would rejoyce exceedingly; it is a mar|vellous <HI>Alteration</HI>; yea, it threatens no less than an Approaching <HI>Extirpation</HI> of the Here|sies, whereby that Sect formerly <HI>Denied the Lord that bought us.</HI> I find the Sect very won|derfully changed, in several of their Circum|stances; and particularly, in that <HI>grand</HI> one from whence the Name of <HI>Quakers</HI> was first put upon them. Heretofore, at almost every Meeting, you might have seen some of them, taken with a strange <HI>Quaking,</HI> which look'd so like a <HI>Diabolical Possession,</HI> as that it well nigh produced another sort of <HI>Quaking,</HI> by the hor|ror it gave to the Beholders of it; and <HI>Fisher</HI> in his <HI>Rusticus ad Academicos,</HI> which is in En|glish, <HI>The Clown speaking to the Scholar,</HI> calls Dr. <HI>Owen,</HI> a <HI>Blind Guide</HI> and a <HI>Bruit Beast,</HI> [a Language, befitting a <HI>Clown</HI>] for some words of his against (as the man styles it) <HI>The Ho|ly Duty of Quaking.</HI> But this is now grown, I suppose, a rarer thing among them; and the words of their <HI>Patric Livingston</HI> upon it are,
<Q>Because the mighty motions of the Bodies of
<PB N="10" REF="000563_0012_0FA70DED758D9070">
Friends are ceased and Friends are still, cool, and quiet, they think that the same power is not in Meetings; but oh ye Foolish Ones,&mdash; Were not all the shakings and quakings of Friends Bodies, to purge out sin? they were but for a little time, and so were quickly gone again; and the voice of the Lord was not distinctly discerned there. The stilness being come, that's a durable thing; and here the mind is brought into a capacity to discern the voice of the Lord.</Q>
One would inferr from this; either that those who are of late years Converted unto <HI>Quakerism,</HI> have <HI>no Sin</HI> to purge out; or else that after their <HI>Quake|rism</HI> they continue with their <HI>sins unpurged</HI> all their Days. But however, 'tis here granted, That about thirty years ago, <HI>The Quakers did not d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">stinctly discern the voice of the Lord</HI>; so that I am not altogether in Despair, that they may now <HI>better discern</HI> it, and by degrees re|turn to him that is the <HI>Shepherd and Bishop of Souls,</HI> by leaving all their <HI>Errors,</HI> as well as the <HI>Tremblings</HI> which first accompany'd them. Ne|vertheless, no <HI>Spectacles</HI> I have yet met withal, can dispose my <HI>Charity</HI> to do any other than suspect the Integrity of the more busy <HI>Teachers</HI> among the <HI>Quakers,</HI> when they seem to ac|knowledge the principal Articles of our <HI>Chri|stian Religion</HI>; there is cause to think, that they <HI>Kiss</HI> that Religion of ours only to <HI>Betray</HI> it; it is doubtless in this thing that they <HI>practise</HI> what they sometimes <HI>profess,</HI> To <HI>become all

things unto all men, that they might win the more</HI>; nor do I make my self a <HI>Judge of Hearts,</HI> if I give you that warning about them, <HI>When they speak fair, believe them not, for there are seven A|bominations in their Hearts.</HI> The cause of my suspicion is plainly this;
<Q>If they believe just as they speak in some of their Confessions, a|bout Religion, pray why do they oppose and reproach us for speaking of those very things?</Q>
For instance, The <HI>Quakers</HI> will <HI>verbally say,</HI> that they own the man Christ Jesus, who suffered for our sins, and in the entire and perfect Na|ture of man is gone into Heaven, and shall in like manner come again. But if they <HI>really think</HI> so, why do they fling out whole Pam|phlets against godly men meerly for speaking that very thing? I pray tell me, Does not <HI>George Fox</HI> in a Folio Book vehemently <HI>Revile</HI> and pretend to <HI>Refel,</HI> one Antagonist for saying, <HI>The Lord Jesus Christ is afar off in his Bodily pre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ce?</HI> and another, for saying, <HI>Christ is with o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t the Saints, in respect of his Bodily presence</HI>? <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> a third, for saying <HI>Christ is distinct from e|very one of us</HI>?

in other places, may gather what he counts <HI>True</HI>; and I now promise you the fair|est and finest System, we have yet had of a <HI>Quakers</HI> Divinity. He tells us, we hold <HI>False Doctrine,</HI> when we say, <HI>That God hath commit|ted his Counsel wholly to Writing</HI>; by which he knows, we mean, <HI>That God has not obliged us to believe or practise any thing in order to our Salva|tion, which the Scriptures do not either directly or by just consequence Reveal unto us.</HI> So then, the <HI>Quaker</HI> holds. <HI>That there is part of Gods Coun|sel,</HI> (that is, that we are to think or do some|thing in order to our own Salvation) <HI>which we cannot learn from the Holy Scriptures.</HI> He tells us, we hold <HI>False-Doctrine,</HI> when we say, <HI>That God hath foreordained whatever cometh to pass</HI>; although he knows we affirm, <HI>That God has not by his Eternal Decree either taken a|way the liberty of the Creature, or become the Au|thor of sin in the Creature.</HI> So then the Quaker holds, <HI>that there are some things come to pass which God has not foreordained</HI>; and so the Blessed God either do's not <HI>Fore-Know</HI> every thing, or else He do's <HI>Fore-Know</HI> something which He do's not <HI>Decree:</HI> and it must be said, that He knows things because <HI>they will be,</HI> and not that things <HI>will be</HI> because he appoints them; and His Know|ledge must be Fal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ble and Uncertain; and the Glorious First-Being is made Subordinate to, &amp; Determined by second causes. He tells us we hold <HI>False-Doctrine</HI> when we say <HI>That God hath not afforded or provided sufficiency of Grace, and means
<PB N="19" REF="000563_0021_0FA70DFA378BD940">
of salvation to all mankind whereby they may be sa|ved</HI>; albeit we also say, <HI>That all mankind are Salvable.</HI> So then the <HI>Quaker</HI> holds, that the <HI>In|dians</HI> and <HI>Negroes,</HI> and the <HI>Pagans</HI> beyond <HI>China,</HI> have <HI>Sufficiency of Grace and means of Salvation.</HI> He therefore holds according to what <HI>Keith</HI> adds upon it, <HI>That the Light that is in every man, is sufficient to enable him to do any work acceptable to God.</HI> He must hold that there is not in the darkest corner of the <HI>Indies,</HI> a man that is <HI>Vnto <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">very Good work reprobate.</HI> He tells us we hold <HI>False-Doctrine,</HI> when we say, <HI>That Christ hath not Dyed for all men</HI>; although we therein speak on|ly concerning <HI>The Secret purpose of God and Christ</HI>; and we grant,
<Q>That the satisfaction of our Lord is both sufficient for all men, and offered to all men; and that a day of patience for all men is thereby procured.</Q>
So then the <HI>Quaker</HI> holds, That,
<Q>Christ has Dyed for all men;</Q>
And that the vertue and success of our Lords Death depends wholly upon something to be done by <HI>men themselves,</HI> which God is not the doer of: That the Death of Christ never bought that <HI>Grace</HI> and <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Repentance</HI> for us by which the Elect are qualified to enjoy the vertue and success of it; and that <HI>Peter</HI> was no more beholden to the Merit of the Lord Jesus for his Salvation, than <HI>Judas</HI> was for his. He tells us, we hold <HI>False-Doctrine</HI> when we say
<Q>That Justification is only by Christs Righte|ousness without us, imputed unto us, and Re|ceived by Faith alone, and not by any Righ|teousness
<PB N="20" REF="000563_0022_0FA70DFB088D5C90">
of God or Christ infused into us, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> wrought in us.</Q>
Albeit, he cannot be igno|rant, that we think <HI>Justification</HI> is always atten|ded with Evangelical Obedience. Hence then the Quaker holds, that <HI>Justification</HI> and <HI>Sanctifi|cation</HI> are the same thing [which is rank <HI>Po|p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">y</HI>; and ye <HI>Keith</HI> charges us with <HI>Antichrist|ianism,</HI> for holding of the contrary: so by the way, <HI>I</HI> see <HI>Keith</HI> is one of those who look not for <HI>Antichristianism</HI> in <HI>Popery</HI>;] and that (as <HI>Keiths</HI> own words are,)
<Q>The Graces of Sancti|fication are the Instruments of obtaining Justi|fication from Christ;</Q>
and so that men exercise all those Graces, before they can be <HI>Justify'd</HI>; and (as <HI>Keith</HI> also elsewhere expresses it)
<Q>He who is imperfectly Sanctify'd, cannot, while such, be perfectly Justify'd; and so it seems there is not <HI>one Justify'd</HI> man alive in the world.</Q>
He tells us we hold <HI>False-doctrine,</HI> when we say, <HI>That beginnings of true Sanctifi|cation cannot be totally fallen from</HI>; although we do also say, That every sin is <HI>Mortal</HI>; That Saints falling into grosser scandals, do bee loud the Evidences of their <HI>Saintship</HI>; That yet Saints cannot fall so far, but God will <HI>Recover</HI> them before they dy, and make them sincerely penitent.

<P>Once more, He saies, we hold <HI>False-Doctrine,</HI> because we say,
<Q>No men ever since the Apos|tles Days are assisted, by any Infallible Spirit, to Preach, Pray, and Write; and that to Speak and Pray by the Holy Ghost, as the Prophets and Holy men witnessed of old, are ceased.</Q>
In wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ch Assertion, we are far from <HI>limiting the Holy One of Is<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ael,</HI> who may still do things extraordinary and miraculous: but our in|tent is That we have no Warrant now to look for such Extatical Inspirations and Infalli|ble Assistences as the Ancient prophets had. And yet we own special <HI>Illuminations</HI> of the Holy Spirit which the Souls of all true Be|lievers do and must experience; and we de|clare that without special <HI>Assistances</HI> of the Holy Spirit, we can do no Duty as it should be done.

world with us a principle that <HI>is sufficient to enable us to do any work acceptable unto God.</HI> Now the <HI>Quaker</HI> must then hold, <HI>That men in our Days have the same Inspirations and Assist|ances, that were given to the Apostles of old; and may preach, pray, write, with as much Infallibili|ty as they.</HI></P>
<P>There are several other things, which <HI>Keith</HI> charges us with <HI>False-Doctrine</HI> for holding of; and what <HI>sense</HI> can there be in his charges? what is he but stark out of his wits, if he do not hold the contray for true Doctrine himself? Supposing then that <HI>Keith</HI> has truly represented the <HI>Doctrine</HI> of the <HI>Quakers,</HI> as indeed he has laid before us but the most <HI>Easy Tenets</HI> of it; You then see <HI>Quakerism</HI> in a <HI>true light</HI>; and I have taken the more pains, because that so to <HI>Behold</HI> it, is a much more difficult thing, than to <HI>Refute</HI> it. My Neighbours, you see what <HI>Quakerism</HI> is, the very <HI>best</HI> of <HI>Quakerism,</HI> or else you are never like to see what it is at all. Say, whether we are like to have any Religion, that may be call'd <HI>Protestant</HI> or <HI>Christian,</HI> if once this Doctrine be received!

<HEAD>The First Argument.</HEAD>

being out of the <HI>Town</HI>; but he has <HI>Ly'd</HI> like <HI>Ananias</HI> himself. I do not mean, in his Ac|count of <HI>Ralph Jones</HI> and his Cows at <HI>Barnsta|ble,</HI> which is affirmed to be a <HI>Lye</HI>: but I mean in his Printed Letter to the Ministers of <HI>Boston.</HI> In that Letter he says, <HI>He is well assured by the Spirit of God, That the Doctrine, which we preach to the people is False</HI>; and says he, <HI>The particu|lar Things I charge on you are these,</HI> The last of them is&punc; <HI>That the Scriptures ought to be believ|ed only for their own outward Evidence, and Testi|mony, and not for the inward Evidence and Testi|mony of the Holy Spirit in mens Hearts.</HI> Now this is a <HI>Doctrine</HI> directly contrary to what we have preach'd a thousand times over. For, tho we do say, <HI>That the extraordinary ways by which G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d Revealed Himself to his People, before &amp; for the writing of all the Scripture, are so Ceased, that we have no warrant now to look for them,</HI> yet we grant, that all Believers do still enjoy the special <HI>Illuminations</HI> and <HI>Assistences</HI> of Gods Ho|ly Spirit; and we hold that without a special Influence of the Holy Spirit in the Hearts of men, the <HI>Scriptures cannot be duly and aright Be|lieved.</HI> But that which makes the LYE of this <HI>Keith</HI> more inexcusably impudent and notori|ous is this.

that assents to the Authority of the Scripture.</HI> And then the Doctor spends more than four whole Pages, to tell us, That the Spirit of God communicates a <HI>Spiritual Light</HI> unto men, and with his work of <HI>Illumination</HI> takes off the per|verse Disposition in their minds, and Effectual|ly <HI>perswades</HI> them to receive the Truth; and therewithal gives them a Spiritual <HI>Sense</HI> or <HI>Tast</HI> thereof in themselves in order hereunto.

<P>But such a person is <HI>George Keith.</HI></P>
<P>The Apostle tells us, That we are not to <HI>pray for</HI> those that have committed the <HI>Vnpardonable Sin</HI>; I am sure then we should not suffer any such doleful sinners to <HI>prey on</HI> us. I know 'tis no easy thing to conclude who are Guilty of <HI>that Sin,</HI> and we should not be hasty, and sudden in such conclusions. Nevertheless there are such Persons who have upon them, the Direful marks, of their being <HI>Not far from the Great Transgression</HI>; and for some of them, <HI>Keith</HI> has been observable. He has been enlightned, and had formerly much of his education and conversation among the people of God; never|theless he is a most Infamous <HI>Apostate</HI> from the Truths and Ways of God, professed among them; and of an <HI>Apostate</HI> he is become, as far as his <HI>Chain</HI> will reach, a <HI>Persecutor</HI>; for besides all his malicious <HI>Railing,</HI> at the Mini|sters of God, which the Scripture calls <HI>Perse|cution,</HI> he levels his Writings at no Design more plainly, than to get them starved of all their poor <HI>Subsistence</HI> in the world; which was <HI>Julians</HI> way of <HI>Persecution.</HI> Were the <HI>Trans|migration of Souls</HI> a Truth, you might, when you see <HI>Keith,</HI> imagine that you see <HI>Alexander the Coppersmith,</HI> alive among us, <HI>doing much harm</HI> to the Religion of which he once made, like <HI>Alexander,</HI> a no mean profession <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="29" REF="000563_0031_0FA70E0639F858E8">
with a no less <HI>brazen</HI> Impudence, than <HI>knock|ing</HI> Diligence, <HI>hammering</HI> of mischief against the true Ministers of God. But he stops not here; for he has arisen to the Malice of <HI>Blas|phemy against a special work of Gods Holy Spirit.</HI> There were four young people sensibly and horribly possessed with <HI>Devils,</HI> in <HI>Boston,</HI> where of the whole Town which is the most populous of the whole English <HI>America,</HI> had full satis|faction The Ministers of the Town by no|thing but solemn and zealous <HI>prayers</HI> over those possessed persons, obtained from our good God, such a deliverance for them all [and they are now <HI>all</HI> alive upon the spot!] as has been heard and read with wonder in more than both <HI>Englands.</HI></P>
<P>Well, This <HI>Keith</HI> in a pamphlet emmitted by him, to Reproach the person that now writes, Reprochfully more than once calls these Prayers, 'A <HI>Co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ju<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing</HI> of the Divel. And afterwards again puts the style of <HI>Charms</HI> and <HI>Spels</HI> upon them. And yet he knows, That it is our profession
<Q>To pray by the Holy Spirit of God;</Q> ye<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, that we suffer for that profession: and he has cause to think that those <HI>prayers</HI> were made by, <HI>The Spirit helping our Infirm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ties.</HI>
Now for him to call these <HI>p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ayers,</HI> but so many works <HI>of the Devil</HI>! I'le assure you 'tis very like that sin, for which our Lord Jesus told the pharisees, <HI>They should never be forgiven.</HI> It is bad enough in the Quakers to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of the best Ministers, as <HI>Parnel</HI> does <HI>They

are meer Witches</HI>: but for a man to put the name of <HI>Witchcrafts</HI> upon the most serious and successful of our <HI>prayers,</HI> I say tis a most horrible Blasphemy against the Holy Spirit of God. And which is further admirable; <HI>Keith</HI> does in a page or two before&punc; charge
<Q><HI>mee</HI> with <HI>Falsifying</HI> the Holy Scripture and Alledging a Down|right Fals<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hood, upon Christ himself, because I say'd in a Sermon, <HI>We are told in Math.</HI> 12, 26. <HI>Satan is not divided against himself.</HI></Q>
Now, I confess, I took that for the <HI>sense</HI> and <HI>scope</HI> of the Text; and I am deceived, if I have not the generality of Interpreters on my side. Yea, 'tis plain, that our Lord Jesus is there vindicating himself from the cursed aspersion (which <HI>Keith</HI> has cast upon the poor Servants of the Lord Jesus here) of
<Q>casting out Divels by <HI>charms</HI> and <HI>spells</HI>;</Q> and His Argument is from the subtilty and policy of the <HI>Devil.</HI>
For if <HI>Devils</HI> do so side with our Lord as to confirm His word&punc; by the <HI>casting out of Divels,</HI> the Devils <HI>Kingdome</HI> would be so <HI>Divided</HI> as to be quickly <HI>Ruined</HI>; but the Devil is too cunning to admit of such a Division in his Monar|chy.</P>
<P>Whereas, <HI>Keith</HI> affirms, <HI>That Christ doth not so much as imply, That Satan is not divided against Satan.</HI> Yea, says he,
<Q>'Tis utterly <HI>False,</HI> for Satan is divided oftimes against Satan; and his Kingdom is divided also.</Q>
Behold, how concerned <HI>Keith</HI> is to wrest from our Blessed Jesus, the chief Argument, by

Printed Questions of that famous Queker <HI>Pen|nington, We can never call the Bodily Garment, Christ, but that which appeared and dwelt in the Body.</HI> The Quakers in <HI>Pennington's</HI> Days own|ed, That there was such a man, as Jesus the Son of <HI>Mary,</HI> and that God, or rather Christ, was in him. But all this is no more than they profess<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d also of <HI>Themselves</HI>; and there|fore <HI>Pennington</HI> also says,
<Q>That which he took on him, was our Garment, even the Flesh and Blood of our Nature; which is of an Earthly perishing Nature; but He is of an Heavenly Nature, and his Flesh and Blood, and Bones are of his Nature.</Q>
In short, I cannot ex|press the Mystery of their CHRIST, in better Terms, than Mr. <HI>Faldo</HI> has done it for them;
<Q>There was an Heavenly, Spiritual, Divine Body Constituted of Flesh, Blood and Bones, in which Christ came from Heaven; and he put that Body, into the other Body of our Nature, which He took of the Virgin; and that outermost Body, He left behind, when He Ascended into Heaven, no-body knows where; and this Heavenly, Spiritual Body, is the Man Christ, which is in the Quakers; and so the Quakers are as com|pleat Christs, as ever the Son of <HI>Mary</HI> was; for they also have the Divine Nature of Christ, dwelling in a Body of Spiritual Flesh and Blood, and those their Bodies which we see, are but the outward Tabernacles of the God, and the Man Christ Jesus.</Q>
It seems,

Now for <HI>That,</HI> after you have Disclaimed all Inclinati|on to <HI>Persecution,</HI> you need only Quote three Things unto them. First, Quote 'em the <HI>Laws</HI> which were then acted upon. The Ge<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|neral Court therein expresly Recognize,
<Q>That no Humane power is Lord over the Faith and Consciences of men;</Q> but the Quarrel against the <HI>Quakers</HI> of those Days, they De|clare to be.
<Q>Their Speaking and Writing Blasphemous Opinions; Despising of Govern|ment, and the Order of God, in Church and Common-wealth: and seeking to gain Pro|selytes unto their pernicious ways; and their Impetuous Attempts to undermine our peace.</Q>
Ask of them, whether one <HI>William Harris</HI> a|mong the <HI>Quakers,</HI> did not publish Writings
<PB N="101" REF="000563_0101_0FA70DB30FF1A270">
<HI>against all Earthly Powers, Parliaments, Laws, Charters, Magistrates, Princes,</HI> &amp;c. Now this was the Spirit of the <HI>Quakers</HI> which then suffered: and in my opinion the <HI>Quakers</HI> do not wisely now to profess themselves of <HI>that party.</HI> The <HI>Government</HI> was then in its Infan|cy, and finding that so little a thing as <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">stray Swine,</HI> was then able to shake it, it was no wonder, if it saw cause to make <HI>severe Laws</HI> against the Assaults and Inroads of those more dangerous <HI>Beasts,</HI> which would certainly have broke up the plantation, if they had not been some way Restrained. The <HI>Jesuites</HI> never Undermined <HI>Old England</HI> more than the <HI>Qua|kers</HI> did <HI>New,</HI> in that Critical Time; nor were <HI>Blasphemies</HI> ever so notorious, as theirs, when they would ordinarily say to our people, <HI>We deny thy Christ! We Deny thy God, which thou callest, Father, Son, and Spirit: Thy Bi|ble is the Word of the Devil,</HI> &amp;c.

Next quote 'em a passage in a <HI>Vindication of New-England</HI> from a certain Lying Address lately Printed; where 'tis said,
<Q>Of late, none has troubled the <HI>Quakers.</HI> These Laws were but begun to be Executed, before the <HI>New-Englanders</HI> grew sensible of their Error in making them; and of them|selves, by disuse they dy'd away, long be|fore their Charters were dis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">bed.

You must note, They had liberty <HI>to be gone,</HI> once and again given them, after they were in the B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ars; but they <HI>chose</HI> what they <HI>had.</HI> They had the phrensy of the old <HI>Circumcellions,</HI> with worse Doctrine and Error in them.</P>
<P>Lastly, Quote 'em the words of a manuscript which was written on <HI>that,</HI> and shall be pro|duced on <HI>this,</HI> Occasion. They are These,
<Q>There is no man that is justly possessed of House or Land, but He would Count it Unreasonably Injurious, that <HI>another</HI> who, Ha's no Authority [and one likewise that had The <HI>Plague</HI> upon him, whereby his Own Children and Servants might be Infected] Should intrude into his House, without his <HI>Consent:</HI> yea, and when the Owner doth Expresly <HI>Forbid</HI> the same, If such an One should presume to enter into Another Mans Habitation, He <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> justly be impleded As a Thief&punc; and if in case of such Violent En|try,

<P>Note, That the Rulers of this Country would have been glad of any Expedient where|by to have kept these <HI>Quakers,</HI> in those Coun|trys <HI>whence</HI> they came and <HI>whither</HI> they had bin once or twice remanded. If after all, they will still Clamour; tell them, That <HI>New-En|gland</HI> has Renounced whatever Laws are against a Just <HI>Liberty of Conscience.</HI> And also tell them, That you are shy of their stories; because because one of theirs, namely <HI>George Bishop</HI> [another <HI>George!</HI> The Fable of <HI>Georges</HI> Fight|ing with Dragons, must give way to a real sto|ry of <HI>Georges</HI> turned into Dragons, if this trade continue; and so many <HI>Keiths, Whiteheads, Fox|es, Bishops</HI>&punc; and the like appear among us.

<P>In sum, I have made these observations, up|on the <HI>Quakerism,</HI> with which you have now seen me Combating.

I</HI> have Observ'd, Sixthly, That the <HI>Quakers</HI> like the Ancient <HI>Pharisees and Hypocrites</HI> Con|demned by our Lord, will mightily Applaud those that are <HI>Dead,</HI> and at the very same time spend whole volleys of Curses upon the <HI>Living Saints,</HI> that are of the very same <HI>Creed</HI> and <HI>way. I</HI> have observ'd, Seventhly, That he who has to do with the <HI>Quakers,</HI> has to do with almost all the <HI>Hereticks</HI> that ever appear'd upon the <HI>stage</HI>; only with this Difference, that former <HI>Hereticks</HI> have had some <HI>Reason</HI> and these have nothing but <HI>Clamour</HI> with them.
