<HI>rightful authority</HI> over us, than the parliament of <HI>Paris,</HI> or the divan of <HI>Con&s;tantinople.</HI> And the grand argument in &s;up|port of this new doctrine is, that our <HI>charter</HI> is a <HI>compact</HI> between the king and our ance&s;tors, by which the <HI>&s;ole</HI> power of legi&s;lation is given forever to our general a&s;&s;embly. And in an&s;wer to this it is &s;aid, that it never was in the <HI>power</HI> of the king to put any Briti&s;h &s;ubjects out of the juri&s;diction of parliament, and therefore, if he had given &s;uch a charter, it would be void; but it is &s;aid further, that it is not true in fact; for that no &s;uch grant of a &s;upreme, independant, un|controlable power of legi&s;lation is, or ever was contained in the charter. Now, if &s;uch a power he convey'd by the char|ter, it is either <HI>expre&s;&s;ed</HI> or <HI>implied</HI>&mdash;that it is not <HI>expre&s;&s;ed</HI> is too clear to be deny'd&mdash;and therefore it mu&s;t be <HI>implied,</HI> or it is not convey'd by the charter, but is merely imaginary. This is a que&s;tion of the highe&s;t importance to every man who has got a head, or any property to &s;ave or to lo&s;e; for the principle, if wrong, leads directly to <HI>trea&s;on</HI> and <HI>rebellion</HI>; to which we are ha&s;tening with a rapidity which, I greatly fear, will &s;oon plunge us headlong in irretrievable ruin, unle&s;s we are &s;topt in our career. In order to a right under&s;tanding of this important matter, it is nece&s;&s;ary to go back and con|&s;ider how the ca&s;e &s;tood before, at, and ever&s;ince the time of our receiving the charter;&mdash;And from this view we &s;hall al&s;o perceive whether the pre&s;ent claim of parliament is new, as many ignorantly &s;uppo&s;e, or whether it was made, openly and expre&s;ly, before the grant of the charter, and has ever &s;ince been uniformly exerci&s;ed by them, and acknowledged by us. To &s;atisfy my&s;elf in this matter, I have made a journey to Bo&s;ton, on purpo&s;e to &s;ee the &s;tatutes at large; and I find the ca&s;e to be thus. In 1650, an act of parliament was made for blocking up the ports of <HI>Barbados, Virginia, Bermudas</HI> and <HI>Antigua,</HI> in which the &s;upreme authority of parliament over all the Colonies is mo&s;t clearly and expre&s;ly claimed, and it is declared "that they are, and ought to be, &s;ubor|dinate to, and dependant upon England; and have, ever &s;ince the planting thereof, been, and ought to be &s;ubject to &s;uch laws, orders and regulations, as are, or &s;hall be made by the parliament of England.&mdash;<HI>Any letters patent, or other authority formerly granted or given, to the contrary notwith|&s;tanding.</HI>" This was during the protector&s;hip of <HI>Oliver Cromwell.</HI></P>

<P>In 1663, under the reign of King <HI>Charles</HI> the &s;e|cond, was pa&s;&s;ed <HI>An act for the encouragement of trade</HI>&mdash;in which is this very remarkable clau&s;e&mdash;"And in regard his maje&s;ty's plantations beyond the &s;eas are inhabited and peo|pled by his <HI>&s;ubjects</HI> of this <HI>kingdom of England;</HI> for the maintaining a greater corre&s;pondence and kindne&s;s between them, and keeping them in a <HI>firmer dependance</HI> upon it, and rendering them yet more beneficial and advantageous unto it, in the further employment and increa&s;e of Engli&s;h &s;hipping and &s;eamen, vent of Engli&s;h woollen and other manufactures and commodities, rendering the navigation to and from the &s;ame, more &s;afe and cheap, and making this kingdom a &s;taple, not only of the commodities of tho&s;e plantations, but al&s;o of the commodities of other countries and places, for the &s;upplying of them; and it being the u&s;age of other nations to keep their plantation-trade to them&s;elves:" &amp;c. Our charter was grant|ed by King <HI>William</HI> and Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> in 1692, which im|powers the general-court to make laws "&s;o as the &s;ame be not repugnant or contrary to the laws of the realm of Eng|land." And in 1696, during the &s;ame glorious reign, an act of parliament was made extending all the acts of trade to the Colonies, and requiring all governors and commanders in chief, "to take a &s;olemn oath to do their utmo&s;t, that all the clau|&s;es, matters and things contained in that and former acts of parliament, relating to the colonies and plantations be punctu|ally and <HI>bon&acirc; fide</HI> ob&s;erved." And it is therein expre&s;ly enacted, "That all laws, by-laws, u&s;ages and cu&s;toms, at this time, or which hereafter &s;hall be in practice, or endeavor|ed or pretended to be in force or practice, in any of the &s;aid plantations, which are in any wi&s;e repugnant to the before-mentioned laws or any of them, &s;o far as they do relate to the &s;aid plantations, or any of them, or which are any ways re|pugnant to this pre&s;ent act, or to any other law hereafter to be made in this kingdom, &s;o far as &s;uch law &s;hall relate to and mention the &s;aid plantations, are illegal, null and void to all intents and purpo&s;es what&s;oever." Thus it appears that two and forty years before the grant of our charter, the juri&s;dicti|on
<PB N="14" REF="014454_0014_0F928F726C2F3010">
of parliament over us&punc; was openly and explicitly claimed; and again, twenty nine years before; and then in the charter it&s;elf, this &s;upreme juri&s;diction is expre&s;ly re&s;erved; and four years after it is again confirmed in the mo&s;t po&s;itive terms, and all governors bound by an oath to &s;ee it &s;ubmitted to. Now, when we con&s;ider this claim, openly and repeatedly made, be|fore, at, and immediately after, the granting and accepting of the charter, if the charter can be view'd in the light of a <HI>compact,</HI> is not this evidently one e&s;&s;ential article of the agree|ment, on our part, namely, that we will acknowledge and &s;ub|mit to the juri&s;diction of parliament? It is plain we accepted the charter under this condition. How then can this, with the lea&s;t colour of truth, be called a <HI>new</HI> claim?

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sharp.</SPEAKER>
<P>My opinion is this. Before the late tea act was made, no tea could be &s;hipped to America, unle&s;s the merchant fir&s;t paid a duty of <HI>one &s;hilling</HI> &s;terling a pound; and this du|ty was paid <HI>in England,</HI> and the merchant took the ri&s;que of it's ever reaching America. This made tea &s;o dear, that the Dutch could greatly under&s;ell the Engli&s;h Ea&s;t India compa|ny; and the American merchants, at lea&s;t &s;ome of them, found their account in purcha&s;ing tea of the Dutch, and run|ning it here; wherefore to enable the Engli&s;h to &s;ell as cheap as the Dutch, the parliament took off <HI>nine pence</HI> of the duty, and left only <HI>three pence;</HI> and this is not paid before the tea arrives &s;afe here, but mu&s;t be paid by the merchant before it is landed. And with the &s;ame view, they by another act, ena|bled the Ea&s;t India company to &s;ell their tea by whole&s;ale, at public auction, in Bo&s;ton; by this means, if we did not fool|i&s;hly oppo&s;e it, in&s;tead of paying from a dollar to eight &s;hillings a pound for tea, we might have it at two pi&s;tareens, or half a dollar, at mo&s;t.</P>

This act laying the three-penny duty on tea, expre&s;ly mentions, among other purpo&s;es, the <HI>rai&s;ing a revenue:</HI> This, &s;ay we, is taking money out of our pockets without our con&s;ent; and it is argued, that if they may do it in this trifling in&s;tance, they may do it in all others; and will go on till they leave us nothing. Upon which I would ob&s;erve, in the fir&s;t place, that it is not true&punc; that this is taking money out of our pockets without our con&s;ent; becau&s;e we are not <HI>compell'd</HI> to buy; and if we <HI>will</HI> buy, the &s;mall pittance which we pay for the duty, we pay with our own <HI>con&s;ent,</HI> as much as we do any money which we pay for any commodity we buy. The &s;ame might as well be &s;aid, when we buy a quart of rum, or a dram, for when we pay for it, we pay our proportion of the duty laid by act of parliament on mola&s;&s;es: This we have done a long time, and never found out that it was a <HI>grievance,</HI> or
<PB N="17" REF="014454_0017_0F928F788A381E90">
that we were thereby made <HI>&s;laves</HI>&mdash;but the con&s;equence is fal&s;e and ab&s;urd; for it can never follow, that becau&s;e we &s;ubmit to a <HI>rea&s;onable</HI> law, therefore we mu&s;t be call'd to &s;ubmit to the mo&s;t <HI>tyrannical, unju&s;t</HI> and <HI>unrea&s;onable</HI> laws. And what is the danger from this law, any more than from other reve|nue laws to which we have &s;o long &s;ubmitted? Tho&s;e laws have all along, in fact, <HI>rai&s;ed a revenue;</HI> and becau&s;e this is mentioned in the act, can this po&s;&s;ibly alter the ca&s;e? Yes, &s;ay our patriots, this is claiming a right to tax us; but I deny it; for as I have clearly &s;hewn, this is no other claim than has been made, exerci&s;ed and &s;ubmitted to, for more than a century: It is e&s;&s;entially different from <HI>taxing</HI> us; for a <HI>tax</HI> is rai&s;ed by <HI>compul&s;ion,</HI> whether we will or no; but this is a <HI>regulation</HI> of <HI>trade,</HI> by which, though it <HI>may</HI> rai&s;e a <HI>revenue,</HI> and is <HI>de&s;igned</HI> for this purpo&s;e, yet no man ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> be <HI>compell'd</HI> to pay any part of it; and if he does, it is his own voluntary act, as much as when he choo&s;es to drink wine or rum, rather than cyder, or to wear Engli&s;h cloth, rather than home&s;p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n; and they are doing no &s;ervice to their country, who thus ab|&s;urdly place <HI>tax acts</HI> and <HI>revenue laws</HI> upon the &s;ame footing, and infer a right of <HI>taxation,</HI> from a right of <HI>legi&s;lation</HI> in other re&s;pects. But further, The tea act, as it is called, was made in the &s;eventh year of the pre&s;ent reign; and the pre|amble, which I took a copy of, runs thus, "Whereas it is expedient that a <HI>revenue</HI> &s;hould be rai&s;ed in your Maje&s;ty's dominions in America, for making a more certain and adequate provi&s;ion for defraying the charge of the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice, and the &s;upport of civil government, in &s;uch provinces where it &s;hall be found nece&s;&s;ary, and towards further defray|ing the expences of defending, protecting and &s;ecuring the &s;aid dominions."&mdash;Now it is generally &s;uppo&s;ed, that this <HI>expre&s;s purpo&s;e of rai&s;ing a revenue,</HI> in the Colonies, is en|tirely new and unprecedented; but to &s;how that this is a mi&s;take, I will read you a copy of the preamble to an act pa&s;&s;ed in the fourth year of this reign, which is thus, "Where|as it is expedient that new provi&s;ions and regulations &s;hould be e&s;tabli&s;hed for improving the <HI>revenue</HI> of this kingdom, and for extending and &s;ecuring the navigation and commerce between Great-Britain and your Maje&s;ty's dominions in America, which by the peace have been &s;o happily enlarged: And whereas it is ju&s;t and nece&s;&s;ary that a <HI>revenue be rai&s;ed</HI> in your Maje&s;ty's &s;aid dominions in America, for defraying the expences of de|fending protecting and &s;ecuring the &s;ame," &amp;c. and then the

act goes on to lay duties on &s;ugars, wines, Ea&s;t-India goods, &amp;c. imported from Great-Britain &amp;c. This act has been, and &s;till is, &s;ubmitted to, without the lea&s;t complaint.

<P>Nay, &s;o long ago ago as the year 1670. In an act made for regulating the plantation trade, one rea&s;on expre&s;ly a&s;&s;ign'd, is that otherwi&s;e "the trade of them would, in a great mea&s;ure be diverted from England, and carried el&s;e|where, and his Maje&s;ty's cu&s;toms and <HI>revenues</HI> much <HI>le&s;&s;ened.</HI>" In &s;hort, every <HI>revenue act</HI> is, in the nature of it, <HI>an act</HI> for <HI>rai&s;ing</HI> a <HI>revenue,</HI> whether it be &s;o expre&s;s'd or not; and it is trifling at this time of day, to &s;tart an objection, which does not carry the force even of a quibble. If it be &s;aid that the money rai&s;ed by this act is mi&s;applied, becau&s;e our civil offi|cers are paid out of it; I an&s;wer, this is a di&s;tinct matter: The monies rai&s;ed by this, and all other revenue acts, are, and, for more than a century, have been, paid into his Ma|je&s;ty's exchequer; and if when there, in&s;tead of being appli|ed towards ea&s;ing Briti&s;h &s;ubjects in their taxes, as formerly, they are now applied for our ea&s;e, by paying the &s;alaries of our governor, judges, &amp;c. which, otherwi&s;e, we mu&s;t pay by an internal tax on our poles and e&s;tates, it &s;eems as if we could have no rea&s;on to complain of this as a grievance: However, even though the money when rai&s;ed was never &s;o gro&s;ly <HI>mi&s;applied,</HI> it would by no means affect the legality and con&s;titutional right of <HI>rai&s;ing</HI> it; the&s;e are matters quite di|&s;tinct and independant of each other.</P>

<P>Well, I'm determin'd to drop my &s;hop preachments, or el&s;e, for the future, to take the right &s;ide of the que&s;tion, and di&s;charge my con&s;cience, whatever becomes of my cu&s;tom.</P>

<P>I profe&s;s, I'm of the &s;ame mind; I begin to &s;ee things in a different light from what I did: Indeed I never liked the high proceedings of the provincial congr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;s; this affair of &s;eiz|ing the King's monies, and taking the militia out of the hands of the governor, I could never &s;ee through; it is again&s;t the King's prerogative, and &s;ounds too much like trea&s;on; and I'm re&s;olved not to go to the next, if I am cho&s;en.</P>

<P>Ah! Friend <HI>Trim,</HI> if all that have preached trea&s;on and rebellion, were to be tuck'd up, as thou phra&s;e&s;t it, the harve&s;t truly would be plenteous, and the laborers few.</P>
