</EPIGRAPH>
<P>AFter a long <HI>Scene</HI> of Peace, Wars ever enter the Stage; Wars are in the same nature with Offences, <HI>necesse est vt veniant,</HI> they must be; though there be a <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 words">,</HI> a woe to him that is the unjust cause of them:</P>
<P>Neither is there any particular place in the World (though at present never so quiet and secure) that can plead any exemption from such a Visitation, till the Lord hath created his universall, everlasting Peace in the world; till then the Church of God upon Earth is Militant, in a Civill as well as in a Spirituall sense, While Sin and the Sons of <HI>Ana<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> are unsubdu<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">d, while the <HI>Philistims are in the Land,</HI> they'l be bid|ding Defiance to the <HI>Host of the Living God,</HI> and <HI>Israel</HI> shall not be without her daily Annoying cares and feares. Thus while the Church hath her Enemies in the world, men ought to be in a readiness, not only to Pray with their hearts and tongues, but to fight with their hands for the <HI>Peace of Jerusalem.</HI></P>
<P>The likeliest way to prevent an evill, is to be prepared for it, <HI>fore-warned, fore-armed,</HI> when the Army of the uncircumcised are in the field, especially when they grow skillfull <HI>to destroy,</HI> it is time for <HI>David</HI> to Command, to <HI>teach the Children of</HI> Judah <HI>the use of the Bow.</HI></P>
<P>A thorow dispatch of these words will not allow the ex|pence of much time in speaking to the <HI>Analysis</HI> of the Chapter it self; yet for our better understanding and profiting by this text, I shall briefly speak a few words concerning the Context: to this end you may note, that this Chapter divides it self into these two Principal parts, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR></P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="000276_0003_0FA4590650117EB0">
First. A <HI>Narration brought to David,</HI> Concerning the Death of <HI>Saul &amp; Jonathan,</HI> those former Victorious Champions of <HI>Israel.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly. <HI>The Effects</HI> which this Sad Relation produced, which were these two, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>A mournfull Poem,</HI> or Song, or a Funeral <HI>Elogium</HI> upon the loss of those two Skilfull &amp; excellent Warriours, <HI>v</HI> 17. <HI>And David Lamented over Saul &amp;c.</HI> Davids afflictions produced us many a <HI>Song,</HI> and this is one among the rest.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>A studious Care</HI> for their own Defence and safety, implyed in the words of the Text; <HI>He bad them teach &amp;c.</HI> Saul and Jo|nathan's Death, Israels defeat, and the Philistims Victory, made David not only mournfull, but also carefull how to prevent the like disaster, when occasion should be for another on set.</P>
<P>The words of the Text are contained in <HI>Davids Funeral song,</HI> and are inserted (if you observe) in a <HI>Parenthesis,</HI> in which respect there is something worthy of notice:</P>
<P>In the former Verse, <HI>David</HI> [you see] had just began to com|pose his mournfull Song; The sad and unexpected newes of <HI>Israels Overthrow,</HI> Saul, and Jonathans <HI>Death,</HI> those <HI>expert</HI> and <HI>valiant Commanders,</HI> who [under God] had been <HI>Judah's safety</HI> and the <HI>Defence of the Country;</HI> the loss of the these made <HI>David</HI> bread out into a deep Lamentation. <HI>And</HI> David <HI>Lamented &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Now least <HI>Davids</HI> mourning should make others either heart|less and fearfull, or give them any occasion of suspicion con|cerning his own Valour and Courage, I say, least any should draw up this disheartning Conclusion. <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> seing the <HI>Philistims</HI> have stain our Mighty and skilfull, and <HI>David</HI> himself hereupon becomes thus dejected and sorrowfull, it will now be in vain for us to think of resisting or prepare for further engaging; wherefore to remove this damp of daunting fears, before he proceeds any further to Lament, he inserts this solemn charge, that they should learn experience how to Fight, cause of sorrow should be no cause of Cowardise, <HI>David</HI> had good Courage in his great grief, <HI>Also he bad them teach &amp;c:</HI></P>
<P><HI>Davids Apostrophe</HI> from Lamenting to bid them prepare son fighting, is an Argument both of his <HI>Prudence,</HI> and constant <HI>Care</HI> and <HI>Courage. And David Lamented &amp;c.</HI> But [left any here|by should judge <HI>David</HI> become either <HI>Careless</HI> or <HI>Cowardly</HI>] be|fore
<PB N="3" REF="000276_0004_0FA45906F772B7A8">
he goes on which his Lamentation, he makes this Pause in a Parenthesis. <HI>Also he bad them teach the Children of Judah the Use of the Bow.</HI> It was by this Instrument (we heard in the former Chapter) Saul was wounded, and so also <HI>Jonathan,</HI> and many others.</P>
<P>The Bow was a principall Instrument then used in their wars, by the more acute, nimble and skilfull managing whereof the <HI>Phi|</HI> listims [very likely] then gained their Victory over <HI>Israel;</HI></P>
<P>Wherefore <HI>David</HI> makes this good use of it, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> That for she better dealing with the Enemy, it was very expedient to teach the Children of Judah the exact using and skilfull handling of that Weapon, <HI>q. d</HI> Our best Policy now is, (knowing where our Enemies skill and advantage lyes) to Labour to match, or rather excel them in their own Art, and so wee shall beat them with their own Weapons.</P>
<P>Skill is a great spur to Courage, and <HI>Warriours</HI> skilfull and Couragious, are most probable to be <HI>Victorious.</HI> A skilfull head or hand and a cowardly heart are most unequal Mates, pitty it is they should ever meet in one person.</P>
<P>I shall speak but a word or two more to the Text, and so pro|ceed to the Doctrine. <HI>He bad them Teach &amp;c:</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Bow</HI> was a principal Instrument then used in <HI>War;</HI> and it is here <HI>figuratively</HI> to betaken for all kind of <HI>Martial Weapons:</HI> and so their learning the right and exact use of that, implyes their learning the skill in the whole Art.</P>
<P>Many Doctrines worthy our notice, and very pertinent to this Dayes design may be deduced from the Words, I shall brief|ly name them, and center upon one of them cheifly.</P>
<P><HI>He bade.</HI> i. e. <HI>David</HI> bade, Whence Observe.</P>
<P>Doctr. 1. <MILESTONE N="I" UNIT="Doct."> <HI>It is the great Duty and Prudence of those Supream Power and Authority, to Order that their People be Trained up and Experienced in the Military Arts, or in the right and skilfull Managing of Martial Weapons.</HI></P>
<P>David bade &amp;c: We have here an Example of <HI>Davids</HI> Kingly Care and Prudence, who (from the overthrow of <HI>Saul</HI> &amp;c:) doth Command his Subjects (for the safety of themselves and preventing the like defeat) to excercise themselves to the skilfull managing of that weapon; now every good example is
<PB N="4" REF="000276_0005_0FA45907B7EC1210">
binding. David as King accounting it his place or Duty to look after the Ordering of that Affaire, sheweth it to be a Duty incumbent upon all Christian Rulers in Place of like Authority or Power; and they that are Rulers over others, are chiefly ac|countable for any neglect in this great Duty.</P>
<P><HI>He bade THEM,</HI> i. e. his Chieftains, Lieutenants, or other under Officers that were experienced professors of that Art, and so able to teach, Whence Observe.</P>
<P>Doct. 2. <MILESTONE N="II" UNIT="Doct."> <HI>It is very necessary in all Military Exercises, and for the makeing a true Proficiency therin, that there should be such experienced persons that may be able, skilfully &amp; expertly to Train up others in the expert knowledg of that Art.</HI> If there be none to teach, how can any be taught: that Body is a meer <HI>Chaos</HI> where all is alike. But again, <HI>He bade them Teach the Chil|dren of Iudah,</HI> Whence Observe.</P>
<P>Doct. 3. <MILESTONE N="III" UNIT="Doct."> <HI>Martial Weapons and Military skill and Exercise do well become and truely belong to a Christian Common Wealth.</HI> Contrary to the Tenent of that abominable Sect, who would perswade us to a Stoical <HI>Apathy</HI> or <HI>stupidity,</HI> &amp; never to use any means of defence against wrong or injury: such Armour they al|ledge is unbecoming a Christians Coat; And therefore their onely word of Command is, <HI>Lay down your Armes,</HI> that so they might have the advantage to take them up. But again, <HI>The use or skill of the BOW.</HI> Whence Observe.</P>
<P>Doctr. 4. <MILESTONE N="IIII" UNIT="Doct."> <HI>The Art or skill of a right and Exact Using or handling of Martial Weapons, is that which a Christian People ought to be carefully and diligently Instructed in.</HI> A Christian people ought to be <HI>Conscientiously Trained up and experienced in Military skill.</HI> There is a Civil as well as Spiritual <HI>Warfare</HI> that a Christian must be exercised in. This is the <HI>Point</HI> which I intend to handle, and that which I judge may be most usefull at this time. In the handling of which, I shall only concern my selfe with these two things, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> to <HI>Confirme</HI> and <HI>Apply;</HI> As for Explication, I know not almost what should be said, I say that <HI>Martal skill</HI> is that which a people <HI>ought to be taught and experienced in.</HI> Now as to the number or quality of persons that ought to be Instructed in this <HI>Science,</HI> is none of my business to discourse, but theirs whose duty it is to Inspect the Ordering
<PB N="5" REF="000276_0006_0FA4590875D612F0">
of that Affair; Neither shall I now spend any discourse <HI>de Jure Belli,</HI> concerning the right or Lawfulness of Warr, the proof of the Doctrine will of necessity inferr the Truth of that: If it appear that <HI>Military skill</HI> is that which ought to be taught, it will certainly follow that it is that which may (when occasion calls) be lawfully practised, since this is the very and of that: that <HI>Art</HI> or <HI>scieroe</HI> is altogether vain which may not admit of a practicall part. Neither again can it be expected that I should explain the Nature of Military <HI>skill</HI> and the manner how men should be <HI>disciplined in that science,</HI> that is a work neither with|in my <HI>sphear</HI> nor belonging to my place: But is the bussines proper to the field, not the <HI>Pulpit:</HI> and the explanation of it to be learned of those who have arrived <HI>Artists</HI> in that <HI>Profession,</HI> and are designed to instruct the unexperiencd therin. It is none of my busyness to teach that <HI>Art,</HI> but to shew that it is a peoples Duty to be carefully and diligently Instructed in it, I now preach matter of Duty, which ought to be practised, especially more diligently and conscientiously then it is or hath been. That it is an Art or skill which is not Natural, but acquired with much Instruction, Industry, Practise, that men do not naturally or very easily come to be Artists in that profession, I suppose, will be readily granted by all that have any experience therein;</P>
<P>Besides the teaching and learning of it which the Scripture in many places doth attribute to it, doth imploy that there is an art, skill or slight in it, which doth require study, discipline and Instruction, for the attaining to it.</P>
<P>But, that the Truth of the <HI>Point</HI> may appear, we may First, <HI>Look into the Scripture it false,</HI> and fee what that may afford in order to the confirming of it. And this we shall find not at all to be scant but rather to abound with such examples and presi|dents as do fitly testifie to the truth of this <HI>Assertion;</HI> though that in the Text being it selfe of <HI>Divine Authority,</HI> may be suf|ficient to confirm the duty alledged.</P>
<P>That it was the practise (Commended and allowed by God) of the people of God in former ages, the scripture doth plentiful|ly hold forth; Now seeing what is written is written for our in|struction, it is our duty to follow those patterns till God shall be pleased wholly to remove all occasion for the like practise.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="000276_0007_0FA4590A8E5FBBB8">
I know before I proceed, that all that can be Objected by any it, the <HI>Promise of peace</HI> in the <HI>Gospel times,</HI> that <HI>Jerusalem</HI> shall be <HI>a quiet Habitation,</HI> and that the <HI>Nations shall learn Warr no more &amp;c:</HI> But how ever (as one answers well) we must not Antidate Gods work, all Gospel Promises are not yet fulfilled; That time shall come, but in the mean time [so long as ther's Warr and rumours of Warr in the World] we must stand upon our <HI>Watch</HI> &amp; <HI>Ward,</HI> alwaies in a Posture or defence for the peace of Zion. While that spirit in man that <HI>Lusteth to envy,</HI> to <HI>fewds and Quarrels,</HI> especially with that and those that are good, be more then it is at present Curb'd and suppressed, it is both duty and prudence to arm our selves against the cruel invasions that may we know not how soon from thence arise.</P>
<P>I will never believe that our Priviledges under the Gospel are now more narrow then theirs were under the Law: If that were a duty and priviledg then for the people of God to prepare for Warr, and to fight for their Lives and Libertys, I cannot believe but that we especially under the Gospel ought rather to be duely prepared against those bloody attempts. I cannot believe that the people of God are bound to sit with their hands in their pock|ets &amp; give themselves up as a prey to their Enemies, &amp; Coward|ly to part with those Priviledges which Christ hath so dearly pur|chased. The Law of Nature, which is Gods Law too, doth ever bind us, so far as we can in a just way, to prevent any evill unjustly offered.</P>
<P>In the Latter dayes, we are told there will be bloody times, <HI>Nation shall rise up against Nation &amp;c:</HI> from hence it will follow that we under the Gospel ought to be more expert and fitted for Battel, then those in former ages; For God you know then did immediatly and miraculously fight for his people, often times giv|ing them very great <HI>Victorys,</HI> by very mean unlikely meanes.</P>
<P>But we in these dayes have no promise of such a miraculous &amp; immediate assistance; God works now by men and meanes, not by miracles: Neither can we expect that the walls of <HI>Rome</HI> as the walls of <HI>Jericho</HI> shall fall with the sound of a <HI>Rams-born:</HI></P>
<P>The Man of sin (no doubt) when his time is come, shall be overcome with the sword of men as well as the sword of the spirit. To her that hath <HI>shed the blood of the saints,</HI> shall blood <HI>be given to
<PB N="7" REF="000276_0008_0FA4590E13D5D1E0">
drink,</HI> now God alone knowes whose Lot it will be to be called to that work, but yet he expects that his people be fitted for such a designe, when he shall be pleased to call them to it. God hath his work for his <HI>Militia</HI> on Earth as well as for that in Heaven. Warr is an Ordinance appoynted by God for sub|duing and destroying the Churches Enemies here upon Earth.</P>
<P>But this discourse is almost a Digression. I say, as yet we have no assurance of freedome from War, and therefore still to be prepared for it; Times are now most dangerous, But to return from whence I have thus digressed.</P>
<P><HI>Abraham</HI> we read was the most <HI>renowned</HI> for <HI>Faith,</HI> and if that alone without the use of meanes would have done it, Could have believed his Enemies into the dust; Besides we read that he is called the <HI>Friend of God,</HI> and so had the better grounds to expect to live in Peace, and yet we find, he thought it both Reason and Prudence to be prepared for War; Thus the Scrip|ture tells us that he kept his men both Armed &amp; Trained, he pro|vided them not only <HI>Weapons of War,</HI> but also taught them the <HI>Art and skill to use them;</HI> as appeares soon after, by the great exe|cution he did, and good success that he had thereby. <HI>Gen.</HI> 14. 14.</P>
<P>Againe, the great Commendation that the Scripture gives of the <HI>Benjamites</HI> skill in slinging Stones at an haires breadth, sheweth that it is a thing very likeing to God, and that which he requires as a Duty in his people, to be very exact &amp; expert in the right using of Warlike Weapons; The Sling was an Instrument of War, much used in the times of Old, and the <HI>Benjamites</HI> we read, were the most renowned for their exact skill in handling the same; They could <HI>sling to an haires breadth:</HI> This plainly shewes that it is the duty of Souldiers now to learn to be wonder|full expert, Benjamite like in the use of their Martial Weapons and Military Exercise.</P>
<P>Againe, what other use do you think can we make of all those places in Scripture, which do so often mention the skill and Va|lour of all those Worthies of Old, why are they so Renowned in Holy Record, and so much commended for their Martiall skill, endowments and exploits, as you may find in that [and many o|ther places] 1 <HI>Chron:</HI> 5. 18. and <HI>Chap.</HI> 12. 8, 33. <HI>verses.</HI> Yea how many <HI>Pages in Sacred Writt</HI> are wholly taken up in menti|oning
<PB N="8" REF="000276_0009_0FA4590E8EEDB760">
of those who have been renowned for the <HI>Art of Souldiery;</HI> now to what purpose should all this be, but cheifly to instruct us in these two things, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR></P>
<P N="1">1. That it is an Art Commended and allowed by God.</P>
<P N="2">2. That by these Patterns we should learn to practise, that as it is said, they were <HI>expert in War</HI> and <HI>handling their Weapons;</HI> So it is the Duty of a people now to be. And this still confirmes the truth of the Doctrine, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> That therefore a people ought to be instructed and trained up to the knowledge of it.</P>
<P>Certainly it requires good teaching and diligent learning to sling a stone at an haires breadth, <HI>i. e.</HI> to be an exact and expert Souldier, to be acute in that Calling.</P>
<P>Again consider, what a Blessing <HI>David</HI> counted to be well experienced in that Art. 144 <HI>Psal.</HI> 1. and think you then, so long as there may be use for it, that it is not the duty of a people to be blessed with the knowledge of it.</P>
<P>Again Lastly as to <HI>Scriptural proof,</HI> The Souldiers that we read of in the Gospel time were not disbanded or discharged, but indeed allowed and encouraged, as those that came to <HI>John the Baptist,</HI> we find not one word of Reproof as to their Calling, but only good counsell how to behave themselves in it, <HI>Luke</HI> 3. 14. <HI>q. d.</HI> go on still, but do not so and so, <HI>be content with your wages,</HI> which implyes indeed be content to be Souldiers.</P>
<P>So the <HI>Centurion</HI> that came to Christ, was good Christian &amp; an excellent Believer although a <HI>Captain</HI> in that profession, <HI>Mat:</HI> 8. 8, 9. Surely Christ that commended him so much for his faith would have reproved him for his Office, had it not been that which was in it self commendable and requisite. But then for our further satisfaction, I shall now give you the <HI>Reasons</HI> of the Doctrine, why it ought to be so.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="reasons">
<HEAD>Reasons.</HEAD>
<P>First, <MILESTONE N="I" UNIT="Reas."> <HI>Because this Military way is the way which</HI> God <HI>doth ap|point, and the usuall meanes whereby he defends and workes delive|rance for his people;</HI> He forbids indeed ye should trust in, yet looks that we should make use of an Arm of flesh. Look through the Scripture, and ye shall find that the general and usual way of Gods delivering his people from or defending them against their enemies, Hath been by this meanes, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> by the use and help of
<PB N="9" REF="000276_0010_0FA45910639972F8">
Arms; Some here and there, one particular instance of Gods miraculous way of defending or delivering his people, doth not at all invalidate the force of this Reason, nor excuse us from the duty propounded; Gods sometimes sending an Angel to fight for his people and destroy their enemies army, as it was not to them so neither is it now any warrant to us from being prepared to de|fend our selves; we have no promise to assure our selves of any such miraculous way of deliverance or defence: Now seing this is Gods way, and he being a Wise God and a God of Order, he will therefore have things to be done in the most orderly and artificiall way or manner. War is his Ordinance, and he hath ordered a certain Art or skill in warring, and hence Commands that his people be trained up or exercised to the knowledg of it; Gods work must be done wisely, artificially and in the best man|ner, so as may be suitable to the glory of his own Nature; to be able to war or fight according to Art, gives much glory to him, who is the Author of every commendable <HI>Art or Science.</HI></P>
<P>Reas. Second. <MILESTONE N="II" UNIT="Reas."> <HI>From the great dependance that the safety and preservation of mens lives and libertyes bath therupon, and upon their so being,</HI><ABBR>viz.</ABBR><HI>Experienced Souldiers.</HI> I told you before, it was Gods usual way of defending us to make us Instrumentall to defend our selves; Now when I speak of Dependance, I speak in subordination to him who is Independant. The Art <HI>Military</HI> [faith one of your own Instructors] being the highest profes|sion as to the preservation of our Countrys [<HI>non nobis nati Sumus</HI>] wherin our Lives, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Barrif</HI></NOTE> Libetries and Estates are included, we ought to be more studious thereof, and exercised therin, but especially Christians who are betrusted with the Oracles of God, and the pleasant things of his house, ought conscientiously and carefully to furnish themselves with skill and ability to defend and main|tain those precious things that are of more worth than the whole world; Yea this is one great part or duty of our Christian war|fare to be skilfull to defend and preserve the true Religion; I say that God hath Ordered a kind of Dependance as aforesaid, yea was it not in a Military or Martial way that the Saints in former ages did preserve and defend themselves, theirs and their Reli|gion, against those that would have rob'd them of all; yea were not others also by them turn'd out of house and home, and that
<PB N="10" REF="000276_0011_0FA45910AC91F920">
because of their great Security and willfull ignorance in the <HI>Military Science, Judges</HI> 18. 7, 8, 9, 10.</P>
<P>Do you not count your Lives &amp;c: worth defending or pre|serving, and is it not rational than to endeavour the most artifi|cial and safest way of accomplishing it? One, and a great Sense wherin God is your <HI>Walls and Bulwarks,</HI> is when he makes you so unto your selves, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> experienced Souldiers, expert to defend your selves: I say, a Countries safety depends much upon an ex|perienced Militia; yea is it not therefore reckoned as the curse, confusion and undoing of a place, when their Mighty and skilfull men of War are taken away? <HI>Isai</HI> 3. 1, 2.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="Third." UNIT="Reas."> <HI>Because Skill is one of the greatest helps to Vict|ory,</HI> especially, <HI>where other accomplishments do also meet;</HI> Victory is the Mark that skill aims at; <HI>Skill of hand, Strength of body, &amp; Courage of mind</HI> do make a compleat Champion, and seldome it is that ever they do miss of Victory; yea good skill is more needfull than great strength: Skill many times overcomes strength; A skilfull though a weak Arm, hath many times given a Fatall blow to an unskilfull though a strong man. <HI>Davids skil|full hand fetcht great</HI> Goliah <HI>to the ground,</HI> he fights blindfold, or like a mad man, that fights not according to Rule.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="Four." UNIT="Reas."> <HI>Because Security, Ignorance and want of experi|ence in the Military Art, is the way not only to invite an Enemy to in|vade a people, but also renders them very lyable to become a Prey, when they shall so do;</HI> See that Instance, <HI>Iudg.</HI> 18. 7, 8, 9, 10. This tempts God to leave you, and let the Enemy take you, wher|as the report of a warlike people and their fame for Martial skill many times strikes fear into an Enemy, and so is one meanes to prevent War. Invasions are judged far more dangerous than, pitcht Battels; because they are suddain, and usually take men unprovided, the unskilfull man is an unprovided man: times of, of Peace are times to prepare for War.</P>
