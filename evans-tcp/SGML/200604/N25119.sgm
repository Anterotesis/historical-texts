<HEAD>AMELIA: OR THE FAITHLESS BRITON.</HEAD>
<P>THE revolutions of government, and the &s;ubver&s;ions of empire, which have &s;welled the theme of national hi&s;torians, have like|wi&s;e, in every age, furni&s;hed anecdote to the biographer, and incident to the noveli&s;t. The objects of policy or ambition are gene|rally, indeed, accompli&s;hed at the expence of private ea&s;e and pro&s;perity; while the triumph of arms, like the funeral fe&s;tivity of a &s;avage tribe, &s;erves to announce &s;ome recent calamity &mdash; the wa&s;te of property, or the fall of families.</P>
<P>Thus, the great events of the late war, which produced the &s;eparation of the Briti&s;h empire, and e&s;tabli&s;hed the &s;overeignty of America, were chequered with &s;cenes of pri|vate &s;orrow, and the &s;ucce&s;s of the contend|ing forces was alternately fatal to the peace and order of dome&s;tic life. The lamentati|ons of the widow and the orphan, mingled
<PB N="2" REF="033290_0005_0FF6B77C030D3060">
with the &s;ong of victory; and the &s;able man|tle with which the hand of friend&s;hip cloathed the bier of the gallant MONTGOMERY, ca&s;t a momentary gloom upon the trophies his valour had atchieved.</P>
<P>Though the following tale then, does not exhibit the terrible magnificence of warlike operations, or &s;crutinize the principles of national politics, it recites an epi&s;ode that too frequently occurs in the military drama, and contains a hi&s;tory of female affliction, that claims, from its authenticity, at lea&s;t, an in|tere&s;t in the feeling heart. It is the fir&s;t of a &s;eries of novels, drawn from the &s;ame &s;ource, and intended for public communication, but as the author's object is merely to glean tho&s;e circum&s;tances in the progre&s;s of the revolution, which the hi&s;torian has neither lei&s;ure nor di&s;po&s;ition to commemo|rate, and to produce, from the annals of pri|vate life, &s;omething to entertain, and &s;ome|thing to improve his readers, the occa&s;ion will yield little to hope from the applau&s;e of the public, and nothing to dread from its candor.</P>
<P>HORATIO BLYFIELD was a re&s;pectable in|habitant of the &s;tate of New-York. Suc|ce&s;s had rewarded his indu&s;try in trade with
<PB N="3" REF="033290_0006_0FF6B75E95629430">
an ample fortune; and his mind, unconta|minated by envy and ambition, freely indulg|ed it&s;elf in the delicious enjoyments of the father and the friend. In the former character he &s;uperintended the education of a &s;on and a daughter, left to his &s;ole care by the death of their excellent mother; and in the latter, his benevolence and council were uniformly exerci&s;ed for the relief of the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, and the information of the illiterate.</P>
<P>His mercantile intercour&s;e with Great Britain afforded an early opportunity of ob|&s;erving the di&s;po&s;ition of that kingdom with re&s;pect to her colonies; and his knowledge of the habits, tempers, and opinions of the American citizens, furni&s;hed him with a painful anticipation of anarchy and war. The texture of his mind, indeed, was natu|rally calm and pa&s;&s;ive, and the ordinary ef|fects of a life of &s;ixty years duration, had to|tally eradicated all tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ions which rou&s;e men to oppo&s;ition, and qualify them for enterprize. When, therefore, the gauntlet was thrown upon the theatre of the new world, and the &s;pirit of di&s;cord began to rage, Horatio, like the Roman Atticus, withdrew from public clamour, to a &s;eque&s;|tered cottage, in the interior di&s;trict of Long-I&s;land; and con&s;ecrating the youthful
<PB N="4" REF="033290_0007_0FF6B780694AD4D0">
ardour of his &s;on, Honorius, to the &s;ervice of his country, the fair Amelia was the only companion of his retreat.</P>
<P>Amelia had then attained her &s;eventeenth year. The delicacy of her form was in uni&s;on with the mildne&s;s of her a&s;pect, and the ex|qui&s;ite harmony of her &s;oul, was re&s;pon|&s;ive to the &s;ymmetry of her per&s;on. The pride of parental attachment had graced her with every accompli&s;hment that depends upon tuition; and it was the &s;ingular fortune of Amelia, to be at once the admiration of our &s;ex, and the favourite of her own. From &s;uch a daughter&punc; Horatio could not but re|ceive every &s;olace of which his generous feel|ings were &s;u&s;ceptible in a &s;ea&s;on of national calamity; but the din of arms that frequent|ly interrupted the &s;ilence of the neighbour|ing fore&s;ts, and the di&s;a&s;trous intelligence which his &s;on occa&s;ionally tran&s;mitted from the &s;tandard of the union, &s;uperceded the cheerful avocations of the day, and di&s;pelled the peaceful &s;lumbers of the night.</P>
<P>After a retirement of many months, on a morning fatal to the happine&s;s of Horatio's family, the &s;ound of artillery announced a battle, and the hor&s;emen who were ob&s;erved gallopping acro&s;s the grounds, proved that the &s;cene of action could not be remote. As &s;oon, therefore, as the tumult of ho&s;tility
<PB N="5" REF="033290_0008_0FF6B7615535F268">
had &s;ub&s;ided, Horatio advanced with his dome&s;tics, to admini&s;ter comfort and a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance to the wounded, and to provide a de|cent interment for the mangled victims of the conflict. In traver&s;ing the deadly field, he perceived an officer, who&s;e exhau&s;ted &s;trength ju&s;t &s;erved for the articulation of a groan, and his attention was immediately directed to the pre&s;ervation of this intere&s;t|ing object, who alone, of the number that had fallen, yielded a hope that his compa&s;|&s;ionate exertions might be crowned with &s;uc|ce&s;s. Having bathed, and bound up his wounds, the youthful &s;oldier was borne to the cottage; where, in a &s;hort time, a &s;tronger pul&s;e, and a freer re&s;piration, afforded a flattering pre&s;age of returning life.</P>
<P>Amelia, who had anxiou&s;ly waited the arrival of her father, beheld, with a mixed &s;en&s;ation of horror and pity, the &s;pectacle which now accompanied him. She had ne|ver before &s;een the &s;emblance of death, which therefore afflicted her with all the terrors of imagination; and, notwith&s;tanding the pallid countenance of the wounded gue&s;t, he po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed an elegance of per&s;on, which, accord|ing to the natural operations of female &s;en|&s;ibility, added &s;omething perhaps, to her commi&s;eration for his misfortunes. When,
<PB N="6" REF="033290_0009_0FF6B782AF37A198">
however, the&s;e fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ions had pa&s;&s;ed away, the tenderne&s;s of her nature expre&s;&s;ed it&s;elf in the mo&s;t a&s;&s;iduous actions for his ea&s;e and accommodation, and the increa&s;ing &s;ymptoms of his recovery, filled her mind with joy and exultation.</P>
<P>The day &s;ucceeding that on which he was introduced to the family of Horatio, his &s;er|vant, who had made an ineffectual &s;earch for his body among the &s;lain, arrived at the cottage, and di&s;covered him to be <HI>Doli&s;cus,</HI> the only &s;on and heir of a noble family in England.</P>
<P>When Doli&s;cus had recovered from the &s;en&s;ele&s;s &s;tate to which he had been reduced (chiefly, indeed, by the great effu&s;ion of blood) the fir&s;t exerci&s;e of his faculties was the acknowledgment of obligation, and the profe&s;&s;ion of gratitude. To Horatio he &s;poke in terms of reverence and re&s;pect; and to Amelia in the more animated language of admiration, which melted at length into the gentle tone of flattery and love. But Doli&s;|cus had been reared in the &s;chool of di&s;&s;ipa|tion! and, with all the qualifications which allure and captivate the female heart, he had learned to con&s;ider virtue only as an ob&s;tacle to plea&s;ure, and beauty merely as an incen|tive to the gratification of pa&s;&s;ion. His ex|perience
<PB N="7" REF="033290_0010_0FF6B7638A9B1680">
&s;oon enabled him to di&s;cover &s;ome|thing in the &s;olicitude of the artle&s;s Amelia beyond the dictates of compa&s;&s;ion and ho&s;|pitality; and even before his wounds were clo&s;ed, he conceived the infamous project of violating the purity and tranquility of a family, to which he was indebted for the prolongation of his exi&s;tence, and the re&s;|toration of his health. From that very in|nocence, however, which betrayed her feel|ings, while &s;he was her&s;elf ignorant of their &s;ource, he anticipated the extreme&s;t difficulty and danger. To improve the evident predi|lection of her mind into a fixed and ardent attachment, required not, indeed, a very &s;trenuous di&s;play of his talents and addre&s;s; but the &s;acrifice of her honour (which an in|&s;urmountable antipathy to the matrimonial engagements made nece&s;&s;ary to the accom|pli&s;hment of his purpo&s;e) was a ta&s;k that he ju&s;tly fore&s;aw, could be only executed by the dete&s;table agency of perfidy and fraud. With the&s;e views then he readily accepted the &s;olicitations of his un&s;u&s;pecting ho&s;t, and even contrived to protract his cure, in order to furni&s;h a plea for his continuance at the cottage.</P>
<P>Amelia, when, at length, the apprehen|&s;ions for his &s;afety were removed, employed
<PB N="8" REF="033290_0011_0FF6B78461568FA8">
all the charms of mu&s;ic and conver&s;ation to di&s;&s;ipate the languor, which his indi&s;po&s;ition had produced, and to prevent the melan|choly, with which retirement is apt to affect a di&s;po&s;ition accu&s;tomed to the gay and bu&s;y tran&s;actions of the world. She experienced an unu&s;ual plea&s;ure, indeed, in the di&s;charge of the&s;e benevolent offices; for in the com|pany of Doli&s;cus &s;he in&s;en&s;ibly forgot the anxiety &s;he was wont to feel for the fate of her ab&s;ent brother; and the &s;ympathy which &s;he had hitherto extended to all the &s;ufferers of the war, was now monopolized by a &s;ingle object. Horatio's attachment to the &s;olitude of his library, afforded frequent opportuni|ties for this infatuating intercour&s;e, which the de&s;igning Doli&s;cus gradually diverted from general to particular topics&mdash;from ob|&s;ervations upon public manners and events, to in&s;inuations of per&s;onal e&s;teem and partiality. Amelia was incapable of deceit, and unac|quainted with &s;u&s;picion. The energy, but, at the &s;ame time, the re&s;pect, with which Doli&s;cus addre&s;&s;ed her, was, grateful to her feelings; his rank and fortune entitled him to con&s;ideration, and the ine&s;timable favours that had been conferred upon him, offered a &s;pecious &s;ecurity for his truth and fidelity. The acknowledgment of reciprocal regard
<PB N="9" REF="033290_0012_0FF6B76544826758">
was, therefore, an ea&s;y acqui&s;ition, and Do|li&s;cus triumphed in the mode&s;t, but expli|cit avowal, before Amelia was apprized of its importance and extent. From that mo|ment, however, he a&s;&s;umed a pen&s;ive and dejected carriage. He occa&s;ionally affected to &s;tart from the terrors of a deep reverie; and the vivacity of his temper, which had never yielded to the angui&s;h of his wounds, &s;eemed &s;uddenly to have expired under the weight of &s;ecret and intolerable affliction. Amelia, di&s;tre&s;&s;ed and a&s;toni&s;hed, implored an explanation of &s;o my&s;terious a change in his deportment; but his reiterated &s;ighs, which were for a while, the only an&s;wers &s;he received, tended equally to encrea&s;e her curio&s;ity and her &s;orrow.</P>
<P>At length he undertook to di&s;clo&s;e the &s;ource of his pretended wretchedne&s;s; and, having prefaced the hypocritical tale with the mo&s;t &s;olemn prote&s;tations of his love and con&s;tancy, he told the trembling Amelia that, were it even po&s;&s;ible to di&s;engage him|&s;elf from an alliance which had been early contracted for him with a noble heire&s;s of London, &s;till the pride of family, and the &s;pirit of loyalty, which governed his father's actions, would oppo&s;e a union unaccompa|nied by the acclamations of dignity, and formed with one who&s;e connections were
<PB N="10" REF="033290_0013_0FF6B78736F5D300">
zealous in the arduous re&s;i&s;tence to the au|thority of Britain. "While he lives," added Doli&s;cus, "it is not in my power to choo&s;e the means of happine&s;s&mdash;and yet, as the time approaches when it will be incon&s;i&s;tent with the duty and honour of a &s;oldier to enjoy any longer the &s;ociety of Amelia, how can I reflect upon my &s;ituation without angui&s;h and de&s;|pair!" The delicate frame of Amelia was agitat|ed with the &s;en&s;ations which this picture had excited; and, for the fir&s;t time, &s;he became acquainted with the force of love, and the dread of &s;eparation from its object. Do|li&s;cus traced the &s;entiments of her heart in the &s;ilent, but certain indications of her countenance, and when tears had melted the violence of her fir&s;t emotion into a &s;oft and &s;ympathetic grief, the treacherous &s;uitor thus pro&s;ecuted his &s;cheme again&s;t her peace and innocence.</P>
<P>"But it is impo&s;&s;ible to re&s;olve upon per|petual mi&s;ery! One thing may yet be done to change the &s;cene without incurring a fa|ther's re&s;entment and reproach:&mdash;can my Amelia con&s;ent to &s;acrifice a &s;entiment of delicacy, to en&s;ure a life of happine&s;s?" Her complexion brightened and her eye in|qui&s;itively turned towards him. "The pa|rade of public marriage" he continued,
<PB N="11" REF="033290_0014_0FF6B768095413A8">
"neither adds &s;trength or energy to the ob|ligation: for, form is the &s;uperfluous off|&s;pring of fa&s;hion, not the re&s;ult of rea&s;on. The poor pea&s;ant who&s;e nuptial contract is only witne&s;&s;ed by the hallowed mini&s;ter that pronounces it, is as ble&s;t as the prince who weds in all the o&s;tentation of a court, and furni&s;hes an additional fe&s;tival to a giddy nation. My Amelia has &s;urely no vanity to gratify with idle pageantry; and as the pri|vacy of the marriage does not take from its &s;anctity, I will venture to propo&s;e&mdash;nay, look not with &s;everity&mdash;at the neighbouring farm we may be met by the chaplain of my regiment, and love and honour &s;hall record a union, which prudence fetters with a tempo|rary &s;ecrecy."</P>
<P>Hope, fear, the &s;en&s;e of decorum, and the incitements of a pa&s;&s;ion pure, but fervent, compleated the painful perturbation of Ame|lia's heart, and in this critical moment of her fate, deprived her of &s;peech and recol|lection.</P>
<P>Any anxious interval of &s;ilence took place; but when, at length, the power of expre&s;&s;ion returned, Amelia urged the duty which &s;he owed to a parent, the &s;candal which the world imputed to clande&s;tine marriages, and the fatal con&s;equences that might ari&s;e from
<PB N="12" REF="033290_0015_0FF6B7896E59EBC8">
the ob&s;curity of the tran&s;action. But Doli&s;|cus, &s;teady to his purpo&s;e, again deprecated the folly of pur&s;uing the &s;hadow in prefer|ence to the &s;ub&s;tance, of pre&s;erving fame at the expence of happine&s;s, and of relinqui&s;h|ing the ble&s;&s;ings of connubial life, for the &s;ake of its formalities. He &s;poke of Hora|tio's inflexible integrity, which could not brook even the appearance of deception, and of his punctilious honour, which could not &s;ubmit even to the appearance of intru&s;ion upon the dome&s;tic arrangements of another, as in&s;urmountable arguments for denying him the knowledge of their union. Finally, he de&s;cribed, in the warme&s;t colouring of pa&s;&s;ion and fancy, the effects of Amelia's re|fu&s;al upon the future tenor of his life, and bathing her hand with his obedient tears, practi&s;ed all the arts of flattery and frenzy. The influence of love &s;upercedes every other obligation: Amelia acknowledged its do|minion, and yielded to the per&s;ua&s;ion of the exulting Doli&s;cus. The marriage ceremony was privately repeated &mdash; but how will it excite the indignation of the virtuous read|er when he under&s;tands, that the &s;acred character of the prie&s;t was per&s;onated by a &s;oldier whom Doli&s;cus had &s;uborned for this iniquitous occa&s;ion! Ye &s;pirits of &s;eduction!
<PB N="13" REF="033290_0016_0FF6B76A44542F50">
who&s;e means are the pro&s;titution of faith, and who&s;e end is the de&s;truction of inno|cence,&mdash;tremble at impending judgment, for "there is no mercy in heaven for &s;uch unheard of crimes as the&s;e!"</P>
<P>But a &s;hort time had elap&s;ed after this fa|tal &s;tep, when the mandate of the command|ing officer obliged Doli&s;cus to prepare for joining his corps. A &s;ilent, but pungent &s;en&s;e of indi&s;cretion, added to the angui&s;h which Amelia felt in the hour of &s;eparation; and not all his &s;trong a&s;&s;urances of inviolable truth and attachment, with the &s;oothing pro&s;pect of an honourable avowal of their union, could efface the melancholy impre&s;&s;i|ons of her mind. The farmer at who&s;e hou&s;e the fictitious marriage had been rehear&s;|ed, was employed to manage their future corre&s;pondence; and Doli&s;cus, finally, left the cottage with vows of love and gratitude at his lips; but &s;chemes of fraud and per|jury in his heart. The &s;mall di&s;tance from New-York, where he was quartered, ren|dered it ea&s;y to maintain an epi&s;tolary inter|cour&s;e; which became, during its continu|ance, the only employment, and the only gratification of Amelia's exi&s;tence. Its con|tinuance, however, exceeded not a few weeks. Doli&s;cus &s;oon a&s;&s;umed a formal and
<PB N="14" REF="033290_0017_0FF6B78B341DF310">
di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate &s;tyle, and the number of his letters gradually dimini&s;hed, and every allu|&s;ion to that marriage, which was the la&s;t hope and con&s;olation of Amelia, he cautiou&s;|ly avoided.</P>
<P>But an event, that demanded the exerci&s;e of all her fortitude, now forced it&s;elf upon Amelia's thoughts. She was pregnant; yet could neither re&s;ort for council and comfort to the father whom &s;he had deceived, or ob|tain it from the lover by whom &s;he had been &s;educed. In the tendere&s;t and mo&s;t delicate terms &s;he communicated her &s;ituation to Doli&s;cus, emphatically called upon him to re&s;cue her reputation from obloquy, and &s;olicitou&s;ly courted his return to the cottage, or, at lea&s;t, that he would di&s;clo&s;e to Hora|tio the &s;ecret of their union. To prevent any accident, the farmer was prevailed upon to be the bearer of the paper which contained the&s;e &s;entiments, and, on his return pro|duced the following epi&s;tle.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE &s;udden death of my father will oc|ca&s;ion my embarking for England to-mor|row. It is not therefore po&s;&s;ible to vi&s;it the cottage before my departure; but you may be a&s;&s;ured, that I &s;till entertain the warme&s;t gratitude for the favours which were there
<PB N="15" REF="033290_0018_0FF6B76BEE95C800">
conferred upon me by the virtuous Horatio, and his amiable daughter.</P>
<P>Although I do not perfectly comprehend the meaning of &s;ome expre&s;&s;ions you have employed, I perceive that you &s;tand in need of a confidential per&s;on, to whom you may reveal the con&s;equence of an indi&s;creet at|tachment; and from my knowledge of his probity (of which you are likewi&s;e a judge) no man &s;eems more conveniently &s;ituated, or better calculated for that office than the worthy farmer who has delivered your letter. To him, therefore, I have recommended you; and, le&s;t any pecuniary a&s;&s;i&s;tance &s;hould be nece&s;&s;ary on this occa&s;ion, I have entru&s;ted him with a temporary &s;upply, directing him in what manner he may, from time to time, ob|tain a &s;um adequate to your exigencies.</P>
<P>The hurry of package and adieus com|pels me abruptly to &s;ub&s;cribe my&s;elf,</P>
<CLOSER><SALUTE>Madam,</SALUTE>
<SIGNED>Your mo&s;t devoted, humble &s;ervant, DOLISCUS.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>"Gracious God!" exclaimed Amelia, and fell &s;en&s;ele&s;s to the ground. For a while, a convul&s;ive motion &s;hook her frame, but gradually &s;ub&s;iding, the flame of life &s;eemed to be extinct, and all her terrors at an end. The poor farmer, petrified with horror and
<PB N="16" REF="033290_0019_0FF6B78DF3C5A980">
amazement, &s;tood gazing on the &s;cene: but the exertions of his homely &s;pou&s;e, at length, re&s;tored Amelia to exi&s;tence and de&s;pair.</P>
<P>It has often been ob&s;erved, that de&s;pon|dency begets boldne&s;s and enterprize; and the female heart, which is &s;u&s;ceptible of the gentle&s;t &s;entiment, is, likewi&s;e, capable of the noble&s;t fortitude. Amelia perceived all the ba&s;ene&s;s of the de&s;ertion meditated by Doli&s;cus; &s;he fore&s;aw all its ruinous con&s;e|quences upon Horatio's peace, her own character, and the fate of the innocent be|ing which &s;he bore; and wiping the u&s;ele&s;s tears from her cheek, &s;he re&s;olved publicly to vindicate her honour, and a&s;&s;ert her rights. Animated then, with the important purpo&s;e, &s;upported by the pre&s;umption of her marriage, and hoping yet to find Doli&s;|cus in New-York, &s;he immediately repaired to that city &mdash; but alas! he was gone! This di&s;appointment, however, did not defeat, nor could any ob&s;tacle retard the pro&s;ecuti|on of her de&s;ign; a &s;hip that &s;ailed the &s;uc|ceeding day wafted her to Britain, friendle&s;s and forlorn.</P>
<P>Innumerable difficulties and inconvenien|ces were encountered by the inexperienced traveller, but they vani&s;hed before the object of her pur&s;uit; and even her entrance into
<PB N="17" REF="033290_0020_0FF6B76EAFC70888">
London, that chaos of clamour and di&s;&s;ipa|tion, produced no other &s;en&s;ations than tho&s;e which naturally aro&s;e from her approach to the dwelling of Doli&s;cus.</P>
<P>Amelia recollected that Doli&s;cus had often de&s;cribed the family re&s;idence to be &s;ituated in Gro&s;venor-place; and the &s;tage, in which &s;he journeyed, &s;topping in the evening at a public hou&s;e in Picadilly, &s;he determined, without delay, to pay him her unexpected and unwelcome vi&s;it. The embarra&s;&s;ed and anxious manner with which &s;he inquired for his hou&s;e, expo&s;ed her to unju&s;t &s;urmi&s;e and &s;en&s;ele&s;s ribaldry; but her grief rendered her incapable of ob&s;ervation, and her purity was &s;uperior to in&s;ult.</P>
<P>Doli&s;cus had arrived about a fortnight earlier than Amelia. The title, influence, and fortune, which devolved upon him in con&s;equence of his father's death, had &s;welled his youthful vanity to exce&s;s, and &s;upplied him with a numerous retinue of flatterers and dependants. At the moment that he was li&s;tening in extacy to that &s;ervile crew, the victim of his arts; the deluded daughter of the man to whom he was indebted for the pre&s;ervation of his life, &s;tood trembling at his door. A gentle rap, after an awful pau&s;e of &s;ome minutes, procured her admi&s;&s;ion. Her memory recognized the features of the
<PB N="18" REF="033290_0021_0FF6B6FA67F2BAF8">
&s;ervant that opened the door; but it was not the valet who had attended Doli&s;cus at the cottage &s;he remembered not where or when &s;he had &s;een him.</P>
<P>After con&s;iderable &s;olicitation, the porter con&s;ented to call Doli&s;cus from his compa|ny, and conducted Amelia into an anti|chamber to wait his arrival. A roar of laughter &s;ucceeded the delivery of her me&s;|&s;age, and the word <HI>a&s;&s;ignation,</HI> which was repeated on all &s;ides, &s;eemed to renovate the wit and hilarity of the table. The gay and gallant ho&s;t, inflamed with champagne, was not di&s;plea&s;ed at the imputation; but ob&s;erved, that as a lady was in the ca&s;e, it was unnece&s;&s;ary to apologize for a &s;hort de|&s;ertion of his friends and wine.</P>
<P>At the &s;ight of that lady, however, Doli&s;|cus &s;tarted. Amelia's countenance was pale and haggard with fatigue and &s;orrow; her per&s;on was oppre&s;&s;ed with the burthen which &s;he now bore in its la&s;t &s;tage, and her eye, fixed &s;teadfa&s;tly upon him, as he entered the room, be&s;poke the complicated angui&s;h and indignation of her feelings. Her a&s;pect &s;o changed, and her appearance &s;o unexpected, added to the terrors of a guilty con&s;cience, for a moment, Doli&s;cus thought the vi&s;i|tation &s;upernatural. But Amelia's wrongs having in&s;pired her with courage, &s;he boldly
<PB N="19" REF="033290_0022_0FF6B7108AD358D8">
reproached him with his ba&s;ene&s;s and perfidy, and demanded a public and unequivocal ac|knowledgment of their marriage. In vain he endeavoured to &s;ooth and divert her from her purpo&s;e, in vain to per&s;uade her to &s;ilence and delay,&mdash;his arts had lo&s;t their wonted influence, while the re&s;toration of her in|jured fame and honour ab&s;orbed every facul|ty of her mind.</P>
<P>At length he a&s;&s;umed a different tone, a more authoritative manner. "Madam," ex|claimed he, "I am not to be thus duped or controuled. I have a &s;en&s;e of pity, indeed, for your indi&s;cretion, but none for your pa&s;&s;ion: I would alleviate your afflictions, but I will not &s;ubmit to your frenzy." "Wretch!" retorted Amelia, "but that I owe &s;omething to a father's peace, I &s;hould de&s;pi&s;e to call thee husband."&mdash;"<HI>Hu&s;band</HI>" cried Doli&s;cus, with a &s;neer, "Hu&s;band! why truly, I remember a rural ma&s;querade, at which an hone&s;t &s;oldier, now my humble porter, played the par&s;on, and you the blu&s;hing bride &mdash;but, pr'ythee, do not talk of hu&s;band."&mdash;</P>
<P>This di&s;covery only was wanting for the con&s;ummation of Amelia's mi&s;ery. It was &s;udden and fatal as the lightning's bla&s;t&mdash;&s;he funk beneath the &s;troke. A deadly &s;tupor
<PB N="20" REF="033290_0023_0FF6B70191683128">
&s;eized upon her &s;en&s;es, which was &s;ometimes interrupted with a boi&s;terous laugh, and &s;ometimes with a nervous ejaculation.</P>
<P>Doli&s;cus, unaffected by compa&s;&s;ion or re|mor&s;e, was &s;olicitous only to employ this opportunity for Amelia's removal, and hav|ing conveyed her into a coach, a &s;ervant was directed to procure lodgings for her, in &s;ome ob&s;cure quarter of the city. She &s;poke not a word during the tran&s;action, but gazing with apparent indifference upon the objects that &s;urrounded her, &s;he &s;ubmitted to be tran&s;ported whither &s;oever they plea&s;ed to conduct her. After winding through a dreary and dirty pa&s;&s;age in the neighbourhood of St. Giles's, the carriage &s;topped at a hovel which belonged to a relation of the &s;ervant that accompanied her, and, he having com|municated in a &s;hort whi&s;per the object of his vi&s;it, an old and decrepid beldame led Amelia into a damp and narrow room, who&s;e &s;cant and tattered furniture proved the wretchedne&s;s of its inhabitants.</P>
<P>A premature birth was the natural con&s;e|quence of the conflict which had raged in Amelia's mind. She had entered the apart|ment but a few moments, when the ap|proach of that event gave a turn to her pa&s;|&s;ions, and called her drooping faculties once more into action. Without comfort, with|out
<PB N="21" REF="033290_0024_0FF6B770E81FC638">
a&s;&s;i&s;tance, in the hour of extreme di&s;|tre&s;s (&s;ave the officious &s;ervices of her anti|quated ho&s;t) &s;he was delivered of a &s;on; but the fond &s;en&s;ibility of the mother obtained an in&s;tantaneous &s;uperiority over every other con&s;ideration. Though, alas! this &s;olitary gratification too, continued not long;&mdash;her infant expired after a languid exi&s;tence of three days, &s;erving only to increa&s;e the bit|terne&s;s of Amelia's portion.</P>
<P>Amelia ca&s;t her eye towards heaven as the breath de&s;erted the body of her babe:&mdash;it was not a look of &s;upplication, for what had &s;he to hope, or what to dread?&mdash;neither did it indicate di&s;&s;atisfaction or reproach, for &s;he had early learned the duty of reverence and re&s;ignation&mdash; but it was an awful appeal to the throne of grace, for the vindication of the act by which &s;he had re&s;olved to termi|nate her woes. A phial of laudanum, left by a charitable apothecary, who had vi&s;ited her in her &s;ickne&s;s, pre&s;ented the means, and &s;he wanted not the fortitude to employ them. Deliberately, then, pouring the baneful draught into a gla&s;s, &s;he looked wi&s;tfully for a while upon the infant corp&s;e that lay extended on its bed, then bending on her knee, uttered, in a firm and &s;olemn voice the melancholy effu&s;ions of her &s;oul,
<PB N="22" REF="033290_0025_0FF6B6ED22A0DA58">
&mdash;"Gracious Father! when thy ju&s;tice &s;hall pronounce upon the deed which ex|tricates me from the calamities of the world, let thy mercy contemplate the cau&s;e that urged me to the perpetration. I have been deluded into error; but am free from guilt: I have been &s;olicitous to pre&s;erve my inno|cence and honour; but am expo&s;ed to infa|my and &s;hame. The treachery of him to whom I entru&s;ted my fate, has reduced me to de&s;pair&mdash;the declining day of him from whom I received my being, has been cloud|ed with my indi&s;cretions, and there is no cure left for the &s;orrows that con&s;ume me, but the dark and &s;ilent grave. Vi&s;it me not then, in thy wrath, oh! Father, but let the exce&s;s of my &s;ufferings in this world, ex|piate the crime which wafts me into the world to come&mdash;may thy mercy yield com|fort to Horatio's heart, and teach Doli&s;cus the virtue of repentance!"</P>
<P>She ro&s;e and lifted the gla&s;s. At that in|&s;tant, a noi&s;e on the &s;tairs attracted her at|tention, and a voice anxiou&s;ly pronouncing &mdash;"It mu&s;t be &s;o!&mdash;nay, I will &s;ee her&mdash;" arre&s;ted the dreadful potion in its pa&s;&s;age to her lips. "It is my Amelia!" exclaimed Horatio, as he ha&s;tily entered the room.</P>
<P>Amelia &s;tarted, and looked for &s;ome mo|ments
<PB N="23" REF="033290_0026_0FF6B77322C0B2B0">
intently on her father, then ru&s;hed in|to his arms, and anxiou&s;ly concealed the &s;hame and agony of her countenance, in that bo&s;om, from which alone &s;he now dreaded reproach, or hoped for con&s;olation. He, too, beheld with horror the &s;cene that was pre|&s;ented to his view: he pre&s;&s;ed his deluded, mi&s;erable daughter, to his heart, while a &s;tream of tears ran freely down his cheeks; till, at lenghth, his imagination, infected with the objects that &s;urrounded him, con|ceived the dreadful purpo&s;e of the draught, which had fallen from Amelia's hand, and anticipated a &s;orrow, even beyond the extremity of his pre&s;ent feelings. When, however, he collected &s;ufficient courage to re&s;olve his fears, and it was a&s;certained, that the meditated act had not been perpetrated, a momentary &s;en&s;ation of joy illuminated his mind, like the tran&s;ient appearance of the moon, amid&s;t the gloomy horrors of a mid|night &s;torm.</P>
<P>When the fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ions of this mourn|ful interview had pa&s;&s;ed away, Horatio &s;poke comfort to his daughter. "Come my child, the hand of Heaven, that afflicted us with worldly cares, has been &s;tretched out to guard you from everla&s;ting wretchedne&s;s: &mdash;that Providence which proves how vain
<PB N="24" REF="033290_0027_0FF6B6FCA2747EE0">
are the pur&s;uits of this life, has be&s;towed upon us the means of &s;eeking the permanent happine&s;s of that which is to come. Cheer up, my Amelia! The errors of our conduct may expo&s;e us to the &s;candal of the world, but it is guilt alone which can violate the inward tranquility of the mind." He then took her hand, and attempted to lead her to the door. "Let us withdraw from this me|lancholy &s;cene, my love!"&mdash;"Look there!" &s;aid Amelia, pointing to the corp&s;e. "Look there!" "Ah!" &s;aid Horatio, in a faultering accent-"but it is the will of Heaven!" "Then it is right," cried Amelia&mdash;"give the poor victim a little earth&mdash;&s;ir! is it not &s;ad to think of?&mdash;but I am reconciled." She now con&s;ent|ed to quit the room, and was conveyed in a carriage to the inn, at which Horatio (who immediately returned to &s;uperintend the in|terment of the child) had &s;topped on his arrival.</P>
<P>It is now proper to inform the reader, that after Amelia had left the Cottage, and the alarm of her elopement had &s;pread around the neighbourhood, the Farmer ha&s;tened to communicate to Horatio the tran&s;actions which he had witne&s;&s;ed, and the &s;u&s;picions which his wife had conceived of Amelia's &s;ituation. The wretched father &s;ickened at the tale. But it was the &s;enti|ment
<PB N="25" REF="033290_0028_0FF6B774D0C0CD98">
of compa&s;&s;ion, and not of re&s;entment, that oppre&s;&s;ed his &s;oul. There are men, in|deed, &s;o abject in their &s;ubjection to the opinion of the world, that they can &s;acri|fice natural affection to artificial pride, and doom to perpetual infamy and wretched|ne&s;s, a child, who might be reclaimed from error by parental admonition, or rai&s;ed from de&s;pair by the fo&s;tering hand of friend&s;hip. Horatio, however, entertained a different &s;en&s;e: he regarded not the weakne&s;s of hu|man virtue as an object of accu&s;ation, but liberally di&s;tingui&s;hed between the crimes and the errors of mankind; and, when he could not alleviate the afflicted, or correct the vicious, he continued to lament, but he forebore to reprobate. "My poor Amelia! how ba&s;ely has her innocence been betrayed! &mdash;But I mu&s;t follow her:&mdash;it may be her in|juries have di&s;tracted her, and &s;he has fled, &s;he knows not whither! Come! not a moment &s;hall be lo&s;t: I will overtake my child, wherever her &s;orrows may lead her: for, if I cannot procure redre&s;s for her wrongs, I will, at lea&s;t, admini&s;ter comfort to her mi&s;eries." Such was the language of Horatio, as &s;oon as he could exerci&s;e the power of utterance. A few days enabled him to arrange his affairs, and having learn|ed
<PB N="26" REF="033290_0029_0FF6B6EA63D9B430">
the route which Amelia had taken, he embarked in the fir&s;t ve&s;&s;el for England. The peculiar object of his voyage, and the nature of his misfortunes, determined him to conceal him&s;elf from the knowledge of his friends and corre&s;pondents; and a lucky chance di&s;covered the wretched abode of his Amelia, the very in&s;tant of his arrival in London.</P>
<P>"Can you tell me, my good ho&s;t, where Doli&s;cus the lord&mdash;, re&s;ides?" &s;aid Ho|ratio as he entered the inn. "Marry, that I can," replied the landlord:" his &s;ervant is ju&s;t now talking with my wife; and if you will &s;tep into the next room, perhaps he will &s;how you the way to the hou&s;e." Horatio ad|vanced towards the room door, and, upon looking through a gla&s;s pannel in the door, he beheld the identical &s;ervant that had at|tended Doli&s;cus at the Cottage, in eager conver&s;ation with the ho&s;te&s;s. He pau&s;ed. "She is delivered; but the child is dead:" &mdash;&s;aid the &s;ervant. Horatio &s;tarted; his imagination eagerly interpreted the&s;e words to have been &s;poken of Amelia, and he could &s;carcely re&s;train the angui&s;h of his feelings from loud exclamation and com|plaint.&mdash;"My lord's con&s;cience grows un|u&s;ually trouble&s;ome" continued the &s;ervant;
<PB N="27" REF="033290_0030_0FF6B777930DC6F0">
"he has ordered me again to inquire after her health, and to provide for the funeral of the child&mdash;would &s;he were &s;afe in America! for, to be &s;ure, her father is the be&s;t old man that ever lived!" "It's well!" cried Horatio. "Did you call, &s;ir?" &s;aid the ho&s;te&s;s, opening the door. The &s;ervant took this opportunity of withdrawing, and Horatio &s;ilently followed him, at a di&s;tance, till he arrived at the habitation of Amelia, in the critical moment which enabled him to &s;ave the life he had given, and to re&s;cue his de|luded daughter from the de&s;perate &s;in of &s;uicide.</P>
<P>When Horatio returned to the inn, after di&s;charging the la&s;t &s;olemn duties to the de|parted infant, the landlord pre&s;ented a let|ter to him, which a &s;ervant had ju&s;t left at the bar, and a&s;ked if he was the per&s;on to whom it was addre&s;&s;ed. As &s;oon as Hora|tio had ca&s;t his eye upon the &s;uper&s;cription, he exclaimed, "What my&s;tery is this?&mdash;A letter left for my &s;on Honorius at an inn in London." He eagerly &s;eized the paper, and retiring into an adjoining chamber, he pe|ru&s;ed its contents with increa&s;ed amazement and agitation.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM &s;en&s;ible that the injuries of which
<PB N="28" REF="033290_0031_0FF6B79028B22AC8">
you complain, will neither admit of denial or expiation. A few minutes after, your note was delivered; &s;ome circum&s;tances had been communicated to me re&s;pecting the un|happy Amelia, that awakened a &s;entiment of remor&s;e, and prepared me for a ready com|pliance with your &s;ummons. To-morrow morning at five o'clock, I &s;hall attend at the place which you have appointed.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>DOLISCUS.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>The voice of Honorius, inquiring for the letter, rou&s;ed Horatio from the reverie into which its contents had plunged him. The honour of his &s;on, the villainy of his anta|goni&s;t, and Amelia's &s;ufferings, contending with the feelings of the father, and the for|bearance of the chri&s;tian, at la&s;t prevailed with him to &s;uffer the ho&s;tile interview to which Doli&s;cus had thus con&s;ented. When therefore Honorius entered the room, and the natural expre&s;&s;ions of tenderne&s;s and &s;urprize were mutually exchanged, they freely di&s;cour&s;ed of the lamentable hi&s;tory of Amelia, and warmly execrated that treachery which had accompli&s;hed the ruin of her peace and fame. Nor had Doli&s;cus confined his ba&s;ene&s;s to this object. The chance of war had thrown Honorius into his power &s;hortly after his departure from the cottage, and di&s;covering his affinity to Ame|lia,
<PB N="29" REF="033290_0032_0FF6B71A0E43A450">
the per&s;evering hypocrite artfully in&s;i|nuated to the commander in chief, that Ho|norius meditated an e&s;cape, and obtained an order for his impri&s;onment on board a frigate, which &s;ailing &s;uddenly for England, he was lodged upon his arrival, in the common gaol, appropriated for the confinement of American pri&s;oners. Here it was, howe|ver, that he acquired the information of Amelia's elopement, and heard the cau&s;e to which it was imputed from the captured ma&s;ter of an American ve&s;&s;el, who had for|merly been employed in the &s;ervice of Ho|ratio, and had received the communication from the lips of his antient patron, in the fir&s;t moments of his grief. The fate which had unexpectedly led him to Britain, Ho|norius now regarded as the mini&s;ter of his revenge. He frowned away the tear which &s;tarted at the recital of his &s;i&s;ter's wrongs, as if a&s;hamed to pity 'till he had redre&s;&s;ed them; and feeling, upon this occa&s;ion, an additional motive for &s;oliciting his freedom, he employed the intere&s;t of Horatio's name, which notwith&s;tanding the political feuds that prevailed, was &s;ufficient, at length, to procure his di&s;charge upon parol. Having ea&s;ily learned the abode of Doli&s;cus, he im|mediately addre&s;&s;ed that note to him which
<PB N="30" REF="033290_0033_0FF6B6F603017090">
produced the an&s;wer delivered to Horatio.</P>
<P>When Honorius was informed that Ame|lia was, at that time, beneath the &s;ame roof, he expre&s;&s;ed an eager de&s;ire immediately to embrace his afflicted &s;i&s;ter; but Horatio &s;trongly repre&s;ented the impropriety of an interview 'till the event of the a&s;&s;ignation with Doli&s;cus was a&s;certained, and it was, therefore, agreed for the pre&s;ent, to con|ceal his arrival from her knowledge.</P>
<P>Ab&s;orbed in the melancholy of her thoughts, Amelia had not uttered a &s;yllable &s;ince the removal from her dreary habitation, but &s;uffered the bufy attentions of the &s;er|vants of the inn, with a li&s;tle&s;s-indifference. The agitation of her mind, indeed, had hitherto rendered her in&s;en&s;ible to the weak|ne&s;s of her frame; but exhau&s;ted nature, at length produced the &s;ymptoms of an ap|proaching fever, and compelled her, re|luctantly, to retire to her bed. When Ho|ratio entered the room, the fever had con|&s;iderably increa&s;ed, he therefore reque&s;ted the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a neighbouring phy&s;ician, who pronounced her &s;ituation to be criti|cally dangerous. In the evening, the un|u&s;ual vivacity of her eyes, the incoherence of her &s;peech, and repeated peals of loud and vacant laughter, proved the di&s;ordered
<PB N="31" REF="033290_0034_0FF6B71C43D2D9F0">
&s;tate of her under&s;tanding, and increa&s;ed the apprehen&s;ions of her attendants. "A few hours will decide her fate," &s;aid the Doctor, as he left the room. "My poor Amelia!" cried Horatio, rai&s;ing her hand to his lips&mdash;&s;he looked &s;ternly at him for a moment, then relaxing the &s;everity of her features, &s;he again bur&s;t into a boi&s;terous laugh, which terminated in a long and heavy &s;igh, as if her &s;pirits were exhau&s;ted with the violence of her exertions.</P>
<P>The ta&s;k which Horatio had now to per|form, was difficult indeed! The virtue and fortitude of his &s;oul could hardly &s;u&s;tain a conflict again&s;t the grief and pa&s;&s;ion that con&s;umed him; whil&s;t on the one hand, he beheld the di&s;traction of his daughter, and, on the other, anticipated the danger of his &s;on. He re&s;olved, however, to keep Ame|lia's indi&s;po&s;ition a &s;ecret from Honorius, with whom he arranged the dreadful bu&s;ine&s;s of the morning, and, having fervently be|&s;towed his ble&s;&s;ing there, he returned to pa&s;s the night in prayer and watching by Ame|lia's &s;ide.</P>
<P>Honorius retired to his chamber, but not to re&s;t. It was not, however, the danger of the approaching combat, which occa&s;i|oned a moment's anxiety or reflection; for
<PB N="32" REF="033290_0035_0FF6B720AF7C6EE0">
his courage was &s;uperior to every con&s;idera|tion of per&s;onal &s;afety. But that courage had hitherto been regulated by a &s;en&s;e of obligation con&s;i&s;tent with the precepts of religion he had often exerted it to de&s;erve the glorious meed of a &s;oldier, but he &s;corned to employ it for the contemptible re|putation of a duelli&s;t; it had taught him to &s;erve his country, but not to offend his God. "If there is a cau&s;e which can ju&s;tify the act, is it not mine? 'Tis not a punctilious honour, a vi&s;ionary in&s;ult, or a petulant di&s;|po&s;ition that influences my conduct:" &s;aid Honorius, as he mu&s;ed upon the &s;ubject. "A &s;i&s;ter ba&s;ely tricked of her innocence and fame, a father ungratefully plundered of his peace and hopes, in the la&s;t &s;tage of an honourable life, and my&s;elf (but that is little) treacherou&s;ly tran&s;ported to a remote and inho&s;pitable land&mdash;the&s;e are my mo|tives; and Heaven, Doli&s;cus, be the judge between us!"</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the dawn appeared, Honorius repaired to the place of appointment, where a few minutes before the hour, Doli&s;cus had likewi&s;e arrived. He was attended by a friend, but perceiving his antagoni&s;t alone, he reque&s;ted his companion to withdraw to a di&s;tant &s;pot, from which he might ob&s;erve
<PB N="33" REF="033290_0036_0FF6B722667A24B8">
the event, and afford a&s;&s;i&s;tance to the van|qui&s;hed party.</P>
<P>"Once more we meet, Sir," &s;aid Doli&s;|cus, "upon the bu&s;ine&s;s of death; but that fortune which failed you in your country's cau&s;e, may be more propitious in your own." "What pity it is," exclaimed Honorius,
<Q>that thou &s;hould'&s;t be a villain, for thou art brave!</Q>
"Nay, I come to offer a more &s;ub&s;tantial revenge for the wrongs I have committed, than merely &s;ubmitting to the im|putation of &s;o gro&s;s an epithet&mdash;take it, Sir,&mdash;it is my life." They in&s;tantly engaged. Doli&s;|cus for awhile defended him&s;elf with &s;uperior addre&s;s, but laying him&s;elf &s;uddenly open to the pa&s;s of his antagoni&s;t, he received his &s;word in the left brea&s;t, a little below the &s;eat of the heart!</P>
<P>"Nobly done," cried Doli&s;cus as he fell, "it is the vengeance of Amelia; and oh! may it &s;erve to expiate the crime of her be|trayer." His friend who had attentively viewed the &s;cene, advanced, when he &s;aw him on the ground: and a&s;&s;i&s;ted by Hono|rius, bore him to a carriage which had been directed to attend within call. He was then conveyed to the hou&s;e of an eminent &s;urge|on, who having ordered the nece&s;&s;ary ac|commodations, examined the wound, and
<PB N="34" REF="033290_0037_0FF6B70C9F52B128">
pronounced it to be mortal." "Fly, &s;ir," &s;aid Doli&s;cus, turning to Honorius, at this intelligence&mdash;"your country will afford you an a&s;ylum, and protect you from the con&s;equences of my fate. I be&s;eech you embitter not my la&s;t moments with the re|flection of your danger&mdash;but bear with you to the injured Amelia, the &s;tory of my repentance, and, if you dare, a&s;k her to for|give me." The re&s;entments of Honorius were &s;ubdued; he pre&s;ented his hand to the dying Doli&s;cus, in who&s;e eye a gleam of joy was kindled at the thought, but it was quickly &s;uperceded by a cold and &s;udden tremour; he attempted, but in vain, to &s;peak; he &s;eized the offered hand; he pre&s;&s;ed it eagerly to his lips, and in the mo|ment of that expre&s;&s;ive action, he expired.</P>
<P>Honorius now ha&s;tened to inform Horatio of this fatal event, and to contrive the means of e&s;cape. But when he returned to the inn, confu&s;ion and di&s;tre&s;s were pictured on every face; a wild, but harmonious, voice, occa&s;ionally broke forth into melan|choly &s;trains, and the name of Doli&s;cus was repeatedly pronounced in accents of tender|ne&s;s and compa&s;&s;ion.&mdash;"How is it my &s;on?" cried Horatio eagerly. "Doli&s;cus is no more!" replied Honorius. "Would he

had lived another day! I wi&s;hed not the ruin of his &s;oul." "But he repented, &s;ir." "Ther heaven be merciful!" exclaimed Horatio.</P>
<P>Here their conver&s;ation was interrupted, by the melodious chauntings of Amelia.</P>
<Q><L>I'll have none of your flow'rs tho' &s;o blooming and &s;weet;</L>
<L>Their &s;cent, it may poi&s;on, and fal&s;e is their hue;</L>
<L>I tell you begone! for I ne'er &s;hall forget,</L>
<L>That Doli&s;cus was lovely and treacherous too.</L></Q>
<P>Honorius li&s;tened attentively to the &s;ong; it vibrated in his ear, and &s;welled the aching artery of his heart. "Come on!" &s;aid Horatio leading him to Amelia's chamber. They found her &s;itting on the bed, with a pillow before her, over which &s;he moved her fingers, as if playing on a harp&s;ichord. Their entrance di&s;turbed her for a moment, but &s;he &s;oon re&s;umed her employment.</P>
<Q><L>He &s;aid and he &s;wore he lov'd me true:&mdash;was it a lover's part,</L>
<L>To ruin good Horatio's peace and break Amelia's heart?</L></Q>
<P>A heavy &s;igh followed the&s;e lines, which were articulated in a wi&s;tful and &s;ympathetic tone, and &s;he &s;unk exhau&s;ted on her bed. &mdash;In a few minutes, however, &s;he &s;tarted
<PB N="36" REF="033290_0039_0FF6B6EF56EB0CD8">
from this &s;till and &s;ilent &s;tate, and having gazed with a wild and aching eye around the room, &s;he uttered a loud and piercing cry &mdash;it was the awful &s;ignal of her di&s;&s;olution &mdash;and her injured &s;pirit took its everla&s;t|ing flight.</P>
<P>The reader will excu&s;e a minute de&s;crip|tion of the &s;ucceeding &s;cenes. The alarm rai&s;ed by the death of Doli&s;cus compelled Honorius to quicken his departure, and he joined the &s;tandard of America a few hours before the battle of Monmouth, in which, for the &s;ervice of his country, he &s;acrificed a life that misfortune had then taught him to con&s;ider of no other u&s;e or e&s;timation.</P>
<P>As for the venerable Horatio&mdash;having carried with him to the cottage the remains of his darling child, in a melancholy &s;oli|tude he con&s;umes the time; his only bu&s;i|ne&s;s, meditation and prayer; his only re|creation a daily vi&s;it to the monument, which he has rai&s;ed in commemoration of Ame|lia's fate; and all his con&s;olation re&s;ting in this a&s;&s;urance, that whatever may be the &s;ufferings of virtue HERE, its portion mu&s;t be happine&s;s HEREAFTER.</P>

<HEAD>HISTORY OF AMELIA, OR MALEVOLENCE DEFEATED.</HEAD>
<P>MRS. Winifrid Wormwood was the daugh|ter of a ru&s;tie merchant, who, by the happy union of many lucrative trades, ama&s;&s;ed an enormous fortune. His family con&s;i&s;ted of three girls, and Winifrid was the elde&s;t: Long before &s;he was twenty, &s;he was &s;ur|rounded with lovers, &s;ome probably attract|ed by the &s;plendid pro&s;pect of her expected portion, and others truly captivated by her per&s;onal graces; for her per&s;on was elegant, and her elegance was enlivened with peculiar vivacity. Mr. Wormwood was commonly called a kind parent, and an hone&s;t man; and he might de&s;erve, indeed, tho&s;e honor|able appellations, if it were not a profanation of language to apply them to a narrow and a &s;elfi&s;h &s;pirit. He indulged his daughters in many expen&s;ive amu&s;ements, becau&s;e it flattered his pride; but his heart was engro&s;&s;|ed
<PB N="38" REF="033290_0041_0FF6B6FED6BAF458">
by the proffits of his exten&s;ive traffic: He turned, with the mo&s;t repul&s;ive a&s;perity, from every propo&s;al that could lead him to dimini&s;h his capital, and thought his daughters unrea&s;onable, if they wi&s;hed for any permanent &s;atisfaction above that of &s;ee|ing their father increa&s;e in opulence and &s;plendor. His two younger children, who inherited from their di&s;ea&s;ed mother a ten|der delicacy of frame, langui&s;hed and died at an early period of life, and the death of one of them was imputed, with great pro|bability, to a &s;evere di&s;appointment in her fir&s;t affection. The more &s;prightly Wini|frid, who&s;e heart was a perfect &s;tranger to genuine love, &s;urmounted the mortification of &s;eeing many &s;uitors di&s;carded; and by the in&s;en&s;ate avarice of her father, &s;he was na|turally led into habits of artifice and in|trigue. Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing an uncommon &s;hare of ve|ry &s;hrewd and piercing wit, with the mo&s;t profound hypocri&s;y, &s;he contrived to plea&s;e, and to blind, her plodding old parent; who perpetually harangued on the di&s;cretion of his daughter, and believed her a miracle of re&s;erve and prudence, at the very time when &s;he was &s;u&s;pected of &s;uch conduct as would have di&s;qualified her, had it ever been prov|ed, for the rank &s;he now holds in this e&s;&s;ay.
<PB N="39" REF="033290_0042_0FF6B73447D343F0">
She was &s;aid to have amu&s;ed her&s;elf with a great variety of amorous adventures, which eluded the ob&s;ervation of her father; but of the many lovers who &s;ighed to her in &s;ecret, not one could tempt her into marriage, and, to the &s;urpri&s;e of the public, the rich heire&s;s of Mr. Wormwood reached the age of thir|ty-&s;even, without changing her name. Ju&s;t as &s;he arrived at this mature &s;ea&s;on of life, the opulent old gentleman took his leave of a world, in which he had acted a bu&s;y part, plea&s;ed with the idea of leaving a large for|tune, as a monument of his indu&s;try, but wanting the &s;uperior &s;atisfaction, which a more generous parent would probably have derived from the happy e&s;tabli&s;hment of a daughter. He gained, however, from the hypocri&s;y of Winifrid, what he could not claim from her affection, the honour of be|ing lamented with a profu&s;ion of tears. She di&s;tingui&s;hed her&s;elf by di&s;playing all the delicate gradations of filial &s;orrow; but re|covered at a proper time, all the natural gaiety of her temper, which &s;he now had the full opportunity of indulging, being mi&s;|tre&s;s of a magnificent man&s;ion, within a mile of a populous town, and enabled to enliven it with all the arts of luxury, by inheriting &s;uch accumulated wealth, as would &s;afely
<PB N="40" REF="033290_0043_0FF6B72527310520">
&s;upport the utmo&s;t efforts of provincial &s;plen|dor. Mi&s;s Wormwood now expected to &s;ee every batchelor of figure and con&s;equence a &s;uppliant at her feet; &s;he promi&s;ed to her&s;elf no little entertainment in &s;porting with their addre&s;&s;es, without the fear of &s;uffering from a tyrannical hu&s;band, as &s;he had learned cau|tion from her father, and had privately re|&s;olved not to tru&s;t any man with her money; a re&s;olution the more di&s;creet, as &s;he had much to apprehend, and very little to learn, from &s;o dangerous a ma&s;ter! The good-natured town, in who&s;e environs the rich Winifrid re&s;ided, very kindly pointed out to her no le&s;s than twenty lively beaux for her choice; but, to the &s;hame or the honour of tho&s;e gentlemen, they were too timid, or, too hone&s;t, to make any advances. The re|port of her youthful frolics, and the dread of her &s;arca&s;tic wit, had more power to re|pel, than her per&s;on and her wealth had to attract. Pa&s;&s;ing her fiftieth year, &s;he ac|quired the &s;erious name of mi&s;tre&s;s, without the dignity of a wife, and without receiving a &s;ingle offer of marriage from the period in which &s;he became the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of &s;o opulent a fortune.</P>
<P>Whether this mortifying di&s;appointment had given a peculiar a&s;perity to her temper
<PB N="41" REF="033290_0044_0FF6B73702DC2D80">
or whether malevolence was the earlier cha|racteri&s;tic of her mind, I will not pretend to determine; but it is certain, that from this autumnal or rather wintry &s;ea&s;on of her life, Mrs. Wormwood made it her chief occupa|tion to amu&s;e her&s;elf with the mo&s;t &s;ubtle devices of malicious ingenuity, and to fru&s;|trate every promi&s;ing &s;cheme of affection and delight, which &s;he di&s;covered in the wide circle of her acquaintance. She &s;eemed to be tormented with an ince&s;&s;ant dread, that youth and beauty might &s;ecure to them&s;elves that happine&s;s, which &s;he found wit and for|tune were unable to be&s;tow; hence &s;he watch|ed, with the mo&s;t piercing eye, all the lovely young women of her neighbourhood, and often in&s;inuated her&s;elf into the confidence of many, that &s;he might penetrate all the &s;ecrets of their love, and privately bla&s;t its &s;ucce&s;s. She was enabled to render her&s;elf intimate with the young and the lovely, by the opulent &s;plendor in which &s;he lived, and by the bewitching vivacity of her conver&s;ati|on. Her talents of this kind were, indeed, extraordinary; her mind was never poli&s;hed or enriched by literature, as Mr. Wormwood &s;et little value on any books, excepting tho&s;e of his counting-hou&s;e; and the earlier years of his daughter were too much engaged by

duplicity and intrigue, to leave her either lei&s;ure or inclination for a voluntary attach|ment to more improving &s;tudies. She read very little, and was acquainted with no lan|guage but her own; yet a brilliant under|&s;tanding, and an uncommon portion of ready wit, &s;upplied her with a more alluring fund of conver&s;ation, than learning could be&s;tow. She chiefly recommended her&s;elf to the young and inexperienced, by the in&s;inuating charm of the mo&s;t lively ridicule, and by the art of &s;ea&s;oning her di&s;cour&s;e with want|ton inuendos of &s;o &s;ubtle a nature, that gravity knew not how to object to them: She had the &s;ingular faculty of throwing &s;uch a &s;oft and dubious twilight over the mo&s;t li|centious images, that they captivated curio|&s;ity and attention, without exciting either fear or di&s;gu&s;t. Her malevolence was per|petually di&s;gui&s;ed under the ma&s;k of gaiety, and &s;he completely po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed that plau&s;ibility of malice, &s;o difficult to attain, and &s;o for|cibly recommended in the words of lady Macbeth:</P>

le&s;&s;on, the reader may learn from the following adventure.&mdash;</P>
<P>It was the cu&s;tom of Mrs. Wormwood to profe&s;s the mo&s;t friendly &s;olicitude for female youth, and the highe&s;t admiration of beauty; &s;he wi&s;hed to be con&s;idered as their patrone&s;s, becau&s;e &s;uch an idea afforded her the faire&s;t opportunities of &s;ecretly mortifying their in|&s;ufferable pre&s;umption. With a peculiar re|finement in malice, &s;he fir&s;t encouraged, and afterwards defeated, tho&s;e amu&s;ing matri|monial projects, which the young and beau|tiful are &s;o apt to entertain. The highe&s;t gratification, which her ingenious malignity could devi&s;e, con&s;i&s;ted in torturing &s;ome lovely inexperienced girl, by playing upon the tender pa&s;&s;ions of an open and un&s;u&s;pect|ing heart.</P>
<P>Accident threw within her reach a mo&s;t tempting &s;ubject for &s;uch fiend-like diver|&s;ion, in the per&s;on of Amelia Nevil, the daughter of a brave and accompli&s;hed offi|cer, who, clo&s;ing a laborious and honourable life in very indigent circum&s;tances, had left his unfortunate child to the care of his maiden &s;i&s;ter. The aunt of Amelia was &s;uch an old maid as might alone &s;uffice to re&s;cue the &s;i&s;|terhood from ridicule and contempt. She had been attached, in her early days to a
<PB N="44" REF="033290_0047_0FF6B715784745B8">
gallant youth, who unhappily lo&s;t his own life in pre&s;erving that of his dear friend, her brother: &s;he devoted her&s;elf to his memory with the mo&s;t tender, unaffected, and in|variable attachment; refu&s;ing &s;everal advan|tageous offers of marriage, though her in|come was &s;o narrow, that nece&s;&s;ity obliged her to convert her whole fortune into an an|nuity, ju&s;t before the calamitous event hap|pened, which made her the only guardian of poor Amelia. This lovely, but unfortunate girl, was turned of fourteen on the death of her father. She found, in the hou&s;e of his &s;i&s;ter, the mo&s;t friendly a&s;ylum, and a rela|tion, who&s;e heart and mind made her mo&s;t able and willing to form the character of this engaging orphan, who appeared to be as highly favoured by nature, as &s;he was per&s;ecuted by fortune. The beauty of Ame|lia was &s;o &s;triking, and the charms of her lively under&s;tanding began to di&s;play them|&s;elves in &s;o enchanting a manner, that her affectionate aunt could not bear the idea of placing her in any lower order of life: &s;he gave her the education of a gentlewoman, in the flattering and generous hope, that her various attractions mu&s;t &s;upply the ab&s;olute want of fortune, and that &s;he &s;hould enjoy the delight of &s;eeing her dear Amelia happi|ly
<PB N="45" REF="033290_0048_0FF6B70ED97FC948">
&s;ettled in marriage, before her death ex|po&s;ed her lovely ward to that poverty, which was her only inheritance.&mdash;Heaven di&s;po&s;ed it otherwi&s;e. This amiable woman, after having acted the part of a mo&s;t affectionate parent to her indigent niece, died before Amelia attained the age of twenty. The poor girl was now apparently de&s;titute of every re&s;ource; and expo&s;ed to penury, with a heart bleeding for the lo&s;s of a mo&s;t indulgent protector. A widow lady of her acquaintance very kindly afforded her a re|fuge in the fir&s;t moments of her di&s;tre&s;s, and propo&s;ed to two of her opulent friends, that Amelia &s;hould re&s;ide with them by turns, dividing the year between them, and pa&s;s|ing four months with each. As &s;oon as Mrs. Wormwood was informed of this event, as &s;he delighted in tho&s;e o&s;tentatious acts of ap|parent beneficence, which are fal&s;ely called charity, &s;he de&s;ired to be admitted among the voluntary guardians of the poor Amelia. To this propo&s;al all the parties a&s;&s;ented, and it was &s;ettled, that Amelia &s;hould pa&s;s the la&s;t quarter of every year, as long as &s;he re|mained &s;ingle, under the roof of Mrs. Wormwood. This lovely orphan had a &s;en|&s;ibility of heart, which rendered her extreme|ly grateful for the protection &s;he received
<PB N="46" REF="033290_0049_0FF6B6E6808F5B38">
but which made her &s;everely feel all the mi&s;|eries of dependance. Her beauty attracted a multitude of admirers, many of whom, pre&s;uming on her poverty, treated her with a licentious levity, which always wounded her ingenuous pride. Her per&s;on, her mind, her manners were univer&s;ally commended by the men; but no one thought of making her his wife. "Amelia (they cried) is an enchanting creature; but who, in the&s;e times, can afford to marry a pretty, proud girl, &s;upported by charity?" Though this prudential que&s;tion was never uttered in the pre&s;ence of Amelia, &s;he began to per|ceive its influence, and &s;uffered a painful dread of proving a perpetual burden to tho&s;e friends, by who&s;e genero&s;ity &s;he &s;ub&s;i&s;ted; &s;he wi&s;hed, a thou&s;and times, that her affec|tionate aunt, in&s;tead of cultivating her mind with &s;uch dangerous refinement, had placed her in any &s;tation of life, where &s;he might have maintained her&s;elf by her own manual labour: &s;he &s;ometimes entertained a pro|ject of making &s;ome attempt for this pur|po&s;e; and &s;he once thought of changing her name, and of trying to &s;upport her&s;elf as an actre&s;s on one of the public theatres; but this idea, which her hone&s;t pride had &s;ug|ge&s;ted,
<PB N="47" REF="033290_0050_0FF6B6F8345A5418">
was effectually &s;uppre&s;&s;ed by her mode&s;ty; and &s;he continued to wa&s;te the mo&s;t precious time of her youth, under the mortification of perpetualy wi&s;hing to change her mode of life, and of not knowing how to effect it. Almo&s;t two years had now elap|&s;ed &s;ince the death of her aunt, and without any pro&s;pect of marriage, &s;he was now in her &s;econd period of re&s;idence with Mrs. Wormwood. Amelia's under&s;tanding was by no means inferior to her other endow|ments: &s;he began to penetrate all the art|ful di&s;gui&s;e, and to gain a perfect and very painful in&s;ight into the real character of her pre&s;ent ho&s;te&s;s. This lady had remarked, that when Mi&s;s Nevil re&s;ided with her, her hou&s;e was much more frequented by gen|tlemen, than at any other &s;ea&s;on. This, in|deed, was true; and it unluckily happened, that the&s;e vi&s;itors often forgot to applaud the &s;mart &s;ayings of Mrs. Wormwood, in con|templating the &s;weet countenance of Amelia; a circum&s;tance full &s;ufficient to awaken, in the neglected wit, the mo&s;t bitter envy, ha|tred and malice. In truth, Mrs. Worm|wood dete&s;ted her lovely gue&s;t with the mo&s;t implacable virulence; but &s;he had the &s;in|gular art of di&s;gui&s;ing her dete&s;tation in the
<PB N="48" REF="033290_0051_0FF6B72992B7D6F0">
language of flattery: &s;he under&s;tood the truth of Pope's maxim,</P>
<P><HI>"He hurts me mo&s;t who lavi&s;hly commends."</HI> and &s;he therefore made u&s;e of lavi&s;h com|mendations, as an in&s;trument of malevolence towards Amelia; &s;he in&s;ulted the ta&s;te, and ridiculed the choice, of every new-married man, and declared her&s;elf convinced, that he was a fool, becau&s;e he had not cho&s;en that mo&s;t lovely young woman. To more than one gentleman &s;he &s;aid, you mu&s;t mar|ry Amelia; and, as few men chu&s;e to be driven into wedlock, &s;ome offers were po&s;&s;i|bly prevented, by the treacherous vehem|ence of her prai&s;e. Her malice, however, was not &s;ufficiently gratified by ob&s;erving that Amelia had no pro&s;pect of marriage. To indulge her malignity, &s;he re&s;olved to a|mu&s;e this unhappy girl with the hopes of &s;uch a joyous event, and then to turn, on a &s;udden, all the&s;e &s;plendid hopes into mocke|ry and delu&s;ion. Accident led her to pitch on Mr. Nel&s;on, as a per&s;on who&s;e name &s;he might with the greate&s;t &s;afety employ, as the in&s;trument of her in&s;idious de&s;ign, and with the greater chance of &s;ucce&s;s, as &s;he ob|&s;erved that Amelia had conceived for him a particular regard. Mr. Nel&s;on was a gen|tleman, who, having met with very &s;ingu|lar
<PB N="49" REF="033290_0052_0FF6B73AE59811B8">
events, had contracted a great, but very amiable &s;ingularity of character:&mdash;he was placed early in life, in a very lucrative com|mercial &s;ituation, and was on the point of &s;ettling happily in marriage with a very beau|tiful young lady, when the hou&s;e, in which &s;he re&s;ided, was con&s;umed by fire. Great part of her family, and among them the de&s;tined bride, was buried in the ruins. Mr. Nel|&s;on, in loo&s;ing the object of his ardent af|fection by &s;o &s;udden a calamity, lo&s;t for &s;ome time the u&s;e of his rea&s;on; and when his health and &s;en&s;es returned, he &s;till con|tinued under the oppre&s;&s;ion of the profound|e&s;t melancholy, till his fond devotion to the memory of her, whom he had lo&s;t in &s;o &s;evere a manner, &s;ugge&s;ted to his fancy a &s;ingular plan of benevolence, in the pro&s;e|cution of which he recovered a great por|tion of his former &s;pirits. This plan con|&s;i&s;ted in &s;earching for female objects of charity, who&s;e di&s;tre&s;&s;es had been occa&s;ion|ed by fire. As his fortune was very ample, and his own private expences very mode|rate, he was able to relieve many unfortu|nate per&s;ons in this condition; and his affectionate imagination delighted it&s;elf with the idea, that in the&s;e uncommon acts of beneficence he was guided by the influ|ence
<PB N="50" REF="033290_0053_0FF6B72BE6033380">
of that lovely angel, who&s;e mortal beau|ty had peri&s;hed in the flames. Mr. Nel&s;on frequently vi&s;ited a married &s;i&s;ter, who was &s;ettled in the town where Mrs. Wormwood re&s;ided. There was al&s;o, in the &s;ame town, an amiable elderly widow, for whom he had a particular e&s;teem. This lady, who&s;e name was Melford, had been left in very &s;canty circum&s;tances on the death of her hu&s;band, and re&s;ided at that time in London, where &s;he had been involved in additional di&s;tre&s;s by that calamity, to which the attentive cha|rity of Mr. Nel&s;on was forever directed: he more than repaired the lo&s;s which &s;he &s;u&s;|tained by fire, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted in &s;ettling her in the neighbourhood of his &s;i&s;ter. Mrs. Mel|ford had been intimate with the aunt of Amelia, and was &s;till the mo&s;t valuable friend of that lovely orphan, who paid her frequent vi&s;its, though &s;he never re&s;ided under her roof. Mr. Nel&s;on had often &s;een Amelia at the hou&s;e of Mrs. Melford, which led him to treat her with particular politene&s;s, whenever he vi&s;ited Mrs. Wormwood; a circum&s;tance on which the latter founded her ungenerous project. She perfectly knew all the &s;ingular private hi&s;tory of Mr. Nel&s;on, and firmly believed, like all the re&s;t of his acquaintance, that no attractions could ever tempt him to marry; but &s;he thought
<PB N="51" REF="033290_0054_0FF6B71349BD7820">
it po&s;&s;ible to make Amelia conceive the hope that her beauty had melted his re&s;olution; and nothing &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed, could more effect|ually mortify her gue&s;t, than to find her&s;elf derided for &s;o vain an expectation.</P>
<P>Mrs. Wormwood began, therefore, to in&s;inuate, in the mo&s;t artful manner, that Mr. Nel&s;on was very particular in his civil|ities to Amelia, magnified all his amiable qualities, and expre&s;&s;ed the greate&s;t plea&s;ure in the pro&s;pect of &s;o delightful a match. The&s;e petty artifices, however, had no ef|fect on the natural mode&s;ty and diffidence of Amelia; &s;he &s;aw nothing that authori&s;ed &s;uch an idea in the u&s;ual politene&s;s of a well-bred man of thirty-&s;even; &s;he pitied the misfortune, &s;he admired the elegant and engaging, though &s;erious manners, and &s;he revered the virtues of Mr. Nel&s;on; but, &s;uppo&s;ed his mind to be entirely engro&s;&s;ed, as it really was, by his &s;ingularly charitable pur&s;uits; &s;he entertained not a thought of engaging his affection. Mrs. Wormwood was determined to play off her favourite en|gine of malignity, a counterfeited letter. She had acquired, in her youth, the very danger|rous talent of forging any hand that &s;he plea&s;ed; and her pa&s;&s;ion for mi&s;chief had af|forded her much practice in this treacherous

art. Having previou&s;ly and &s;ecretly enga|ged Mr. Nel&s;on to drink tea with her, &s;he wrote a billet to Amelia, in the name of that gentleman, and with the mo&s;t perfect imita|tion of his hand. The billet &s;aid, that he de&s;igned him&s;elf the plea&s;ure of pa&s;&s;ing that afternoon at the hou&s;e of Mrs. Wormwood, and reque&s;ted the favour of a private confer|ence with Mi&s;s Nevil in the cour&s;e of the evening, intimating, in the mo&s;t delicate and doubtful terms, an ardent de&s;ire of be|coming her hu&s;band. Mrs. Wormwood contrived that Amelia &s;hould not receive this billet till ju&s;t before dinner-time, that &s;he might not &s;how it to her friend and con|fidant, Mrs. Melford, and by her means, de|tect its fallacy before the hour of her intend|ed humiliation arrived.</P>
<P>Amelia blu&s;hed in reading the note, and, in the fir&s;t &s;urpri&s;e of un&s;u&s;pecting innocence, gave it to the vigilant Mrs. Wormwood; who bur&s;t into vehement expre&s;&s;ions of de|light; congratulated her blu&s;hing gue&s;t on the full &s;ucce&s;s of her charms, and triumph|ed in her own prophetic di&s;cernment. They &s;at down to dinner, but poor Amelia could hardly &s;wallow a mor&s;el; her mind was in a tumultuous agitation of plea&s;ure and a|mazement. The malicious impo&s;ter, en|joying her confu&s;ion, allowed her no time
<PB N="53" REF="033290_0056_0FF6B7083324F8C8">
to compo&s;e her hurried &s;pirits in the &s;olitude of her chamber. Some female vi&s;itors ar|rived to tea; and, at length, Mr. Nel&s;on entered the room. Amelia trembled and blu&s;hed as he approached her; but &s;he was a little relieved from her embarra&s;&s;ment by the bu&s;ine&s;s of the tea-table, over which &s;he pre&s;ided. Amelia was naturally graceful in every thing &s;he did, but the pre&s;ent agi|tation of her mind gave a temporary awk|wardne&s;s to all her motions: &s;he committed many little blunders in the management of the tea-table; a cup fell from her trembling hand, and was broken; but the politene&s;s of Mr. Nel&s;on led him to &s;ay &s;o many kind and graceful things to her on the&s;e petty in|cidents, that, in&s;tead of encrea&s;ing her di&s;|tre&s;s, they produced an oppo&s;ite effect, and the tumult of her bo&s;om gradually &s;ub&s;ided into a calm and compo&s;ed delight. She ventured to meet the eyes of Mr. Nel&s;on, and thought them expre&s;&s;ive of that tender|ne&s;s which promi&s;ed a happy end to all her misfortunes. At the idea of exchanging mi&s;ery and dependance for comfort and honor, as the wife of &s;o amiable a man, her heart expanded with the mo&s;t innocent and grateful joy. This appeared in her counte|nance, and gave &s;uch an exqui&s;ite radiance to
<PB N="54" REF="033290_0057_0FF6B72E1AA165E8">
to all her features, that &s;he looked a thou|&s;and times more beautiful than ever. Mrs. Wormwood &s;aw this improvement of her charms, and, &s;ickening at the &s;ight, deter|mined to reduce the &s;plendor of &s;uch in&s;uf|ferable beauty, and ha&s;tily terminate the tri|umph of her deluded gue&s;t. She began with a few malicious and &s;arca&s;tic remarks on the vanity of beautiful young women, and the hopes, which they frequently enter|tain of an imaginary lover; but finding the&s;e remarks produced not the effect &s;he in|tended, &s;he took an opportunity of whi&s;per|ing in the ear of Amelia, and begged her not to harbour any vain expectations, for the billet &s;he had received was a counter|feit, and a mere piece of plea&s;antry. Ame|lia &s;huddered, and turned pale: &s;urpri&s;e, di&s;appointment, and indignation, con&s;pired to overwhelm her. She exerted her utmo&s;t power to conceal her emotions; but the conflict in her bo&s;om was too violent to be di&s;gui&s;ed. The tears, which &s;he vainly en|deavoured to &s;uppre&s;s, bur&s;t forth, and &s;he was obliged to quit the room in very vi&s;ible di&s;order. Mr. Nel&s;on expre&s;&s;ed his con|cern; but he was checked in his benevolent inquiries by the caution of Mrs. Wormwood, who &s;aid, on the occa&s;ion, that Mi&s;s Nevil
<PB N="55" REF="033290_0058_0FF6B6F3C4449338">
was a very amiable girl, but &s;he had &s;ome peculiarities of temper, and was apt to put a wrong con&s;truction on the innocent plea|&s;antry of her friends. Mr. Nel&s;on ob&s;erving that Amelia did not return, and hoping that his departure might contribute to re&s;tore the interrupted harmony of the hou&s;e, took an early leave of Mrs. Wormwood, who im|mediately flew to the chamber of Amelia, to exult, like a fiend, over that lovely vic|tim of her &s;ucce&s;sful malignity. She found not the per&s;on whom &s;he was &s;o eager to in|&s;ult. Amelia had, indeed, retired to her chamber, and pa&s;&s;ed there a very mi&s;erable half hour, much hurt by the treacherous cruelty of Mrs. Wormwood, and &s;till more wounded by reflections on her own credulity, which &s;he condemned with that exce&s;s of &s;everity &s;o natural to a delicate mind in ar|raigning it&s;elf. She would have flown for immediate con&s;olation to her friend, Mrs. Melford, but &s;he had rea&s;on to believe that lady engaged on a vi&s;it, and &s;he therefore re&s;olved to take a &s;olitary walk for the pur|po&s;e of compo&s;ing her &s;pirits; but neither &s;olitude nor exerci&s;e could re&s;tore her tran|quillity; and, as it grew late in the evening, &s;he ha&s;tened to Mrs. Melford's, in hopes of now finding her returned. Her worthy old
<PB N="56" REF="033290_0059_0FF6B7174DFA8D60">
confident was, indeed, in her little parlour alone, when Amelia entered the room. The eyes of this lovely girl immediately betray|ed her di&s;tre&s;s; and the old lady, with her u&s;ual tenderne&s;s, exclaimed, "Good heav|en! my dear child, for what have you been crying?" "Becau&s;e," replied Amelia, in a broken voice, and bur&s;ting into a fre&s;h &s;how|er of tears, "becau&s;e I am a fool?"&mdash;Mrs. Melford began to be mo&s;t &s;eriou&s;ly alarmed, and, expre&s;&s;ing her maternal &s;olicitude in the kinde&s;t manner. Amelia produced the fatal paper&mdash;"There," &s;ays &s;he, "is a letter in the name of your excellent friend, Mr. Nel|&s;on; it is a forgery of Mrs. Wormwood's, and I have been &s;uch an idiot as to believe it real." The affectionate Mrs. Melford, who in her fir&s;t alarm, had apprehended a much heavier calamity, was her&s;elf greatly com|forted in di&s;covering the truth, and &s;aid many kind things to con&s;ole her young friend. "Do not fancy," replied Amelia, "that I am fooli&s;hly in love with Mr. Nel&s;on, though I think him the mo&s;t plea&s;ing as well as the mo&s;t excellent of men; and though I confe&s;s to you, that I &s;hould certainly think it a ble&s;&s;ed lot to find a refuge from the mi&s;ery of my pre&s;ent dependance, in the arms of &s;o benevolent and &s;o generous
<PB N="57" REF="033290_0060_0FF6B7057291D8B8">
a protector."&mdash;"Tho&s;e arms are now open to receive you," &s;aid a voice that was heard before the &s;peaker appeared. Amelia &s;tarted at the &s;ound, and her &s;urpri&s;e was not a little encrea&s;ed in &s;eeing Mr. Nel&s;on him|&s;elf, who entering the room from an adjoin|ing apartment, embraced the lovely orphan in a tran&s;port of tenderne&s;s and delight. Amelia, alive to all the feelings of genuine mode&s;ty, was for &s;ome minutes more pain|fully di&s;tre&s;&s;ed by this &s;urpri&s;e, than &s;he had been by her pa&s;t mortification: &s;he was ready to &s;ink into the earth, at the idea of having betrayed her &s;ecret to the man, from whom &s;he would have laboured mo&s;t to conceal it. In the fir&s;t tumult of this delicate confu&s;ion, &s;he &s;inks into a chair, and hides her face in her handkerchief. Nel&s;on with a mixture of re&s;pect and love, being a|fraid of encrea&s;ing her di&s;tre&s;s, &s;eizes one of her hands, and continues to ki&s;s it without uttering a word. The good Mrs. Melford, almo&s;t as much a&s;toni&s;hed, but le&s;s painful|ly confu&s;ed than Amelia, beholds this unex|pected &s;cene with that kind of joy which is much more di&s;po&s;ed to weep than to &s;peak: &mdash;And, while this little party is thus ab&s;orb|ed in &s;ilence, let me ha&s;ten to relate the in|cidents which produced their &s;ituation.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="033290_0061_0FF6B7304E646AF0">Mr. Nel&s;on had ob&s;erved the &s;arca&s;tic manner of Mrs. Wormwood towards Ame|lia, and, as &s;oon as he had ended his uncom|fortable vi&s;it, he ha&s;tened to the worthy Mrs. Melford, to give her &s;ome little account of what had pa&s;&s;ed, and to concert with her &s;ome happier plan for the &s;upport of this a|miable, in&s;ulted orphan. "I am acquaint|ed," &s;aid he, "with &s;ome brave and weal|thy officers, who have &s;erved with the father of Mi&s;s Nevil, and often &s;peak of him with re&s;pect; I am &s;ure I can rai&s;e among them a &s;ub&s;cription for the maintenance of this tender unfortunate girl: we will procure for her an annuity, that &s;hall enable her to e&s;cape from &s;uch malignant patronage, to have a little home of her own, and to &s;up|port a &s;ervant." Mrs. Melford was tran&s;|ported at this idea; and, recollecting all her obligations to this benevolent man, wept, and extolled his genero&s;ity; and, &s;ee|ing Amelia at &s;ome di&s;tance, through a bow window, which commanded the &s;treet in which &s;he lived, "thank Heaven," &s;he cri|ed, "here comes my poor child, to hear and ble&s;s you for the extent of your goodne&s;s." Nel&s;on, who delighted mo&s;t in doing good by &s;tealth, immediately extorted from the good old lady a promi&s;e of &s;ecrecy: it was the be&s;t part of his plan, that Amelia &s;hould
<PB N="59" REF="033290_0062_0FF6B70A6851EE10">
never know the per&s;ons to whom &s;he was to owe her independence. "I am &s;tiil afraid of you, my worthy old friend," &s;aid Nel&s;on "your countenance or manner will, I know betray me, if Mi&s;s Nevil &s;ees me here to|night."&mdash;"Well," &s;aid the delighted old la|dy, "I will humour your delicacy; Amelia will, probably, not &s;tay with me ten min|utes; you may amu&s;e your&s;elf, for that time, in my &s;pacious garden; I will not &s;ay you are here; and, as &s;oon as the good girl re|turns home I will come and impart to you the particulars of her recent vexation."&mdash; "Admirably &s;ettled," cried Nel&s;on; and he immediately retreated into a little back room, which led into a long &s;lip of ground, embelli&s;hed with the &s;weete&s;t and lea&s;t ex|pen&s;ive flowers, which afforded a favourite occupation and amu&s;ement to Mrs. Mel|ford. Nel&s;on, after taking a few turns in this diminutive garden, finding him&s;elf ra|ther chilled by the air of the evening, re|treated again into the little parlour he had pa&s;&s;ed, intending to wait there till Amelia departed; but the partition between the parlours being extremely &s;light, he over|heard the tender confe&s;&s;ions of Amelia, and was hurried towards her by an irre&s;i&s;tible impul&s;e, in the manner already de&s;cribed.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="033290_0063_0FF6B703C4B3A0E8">Mrs. Melford was the fir&s;t who recovered from the kind of trance into which our little party had been thrown by their general &s;ur|pri&s;e; and &s;he enabled the tender pair, in the pro&s;pect of who&s;e union her warm heart exulted, to regain that ea&s;y and joyous po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of their faculties, which they lo&s;t for &s;ome little time in their embarra&s;&s;ment. The applau&s;e of her friend, and the adoration of her lover, &s;oon taught the diffident Amelia to think le&s;s &s;everely of her&s;elf. The warm|hearted Mrs. Melford declared that the&s;e oc|currences were the work of Heaven. "That," replied the affectionate Nel&s;on, "I am mo&s;t willing to allow; but you mu&s;t grant, that Heaven has produced our happine&s;s by the blind agency of a fiend; and, as our dear Amelia has too gentle a &s;pirit to rejoice in beholding the malignity of a devil convert|ed into the torment of its po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, I mu&s;t beg, that &s;he may not return, even for a &s;in|gle night, to the hou&s;e of Mrs. Wormwood." Amelia pleaded her &s;en&s;e of pa&s;t obligations, and wi&s;hed to take a peaceful leave of her patrone&s;s; but &s;he &s;ubmitted to the urgent entreaties of Nel&s;on, and remained for a few weeks under the roof of Mrs. Melford, when &s;he was united to the man of her heart. Nel&s;on had the double delight of rewarding
<PB N="61" REF="033290_0064_0FF6B6E44BA37A18">
the affection of an angel, and of puni&s;hing the malevolence of a fiend: he announced in per&s;on to Mrs. Wormwood, his intended marriage with Amelia, on the very night when the treacherous Old Maid had amu&s;ed her&s;elf with the hope of deriding her gue&s;t; who&s;e return &s;he was eagerly expecting, in the very moment Nel&s;on arrived to &s;ay, that Amelia would return no more.</P>
<P>The &s;urpri&s;e and mortification of Mrs. Wormwood aro&s;e almo&s;t to frenzy; &s;he racked her malicious and inventive brain for expedients to defeat the match, and cir|culated a report for that purpo&s;e, which de|cency will not allow me to explain. Her artifice was detected and de&s;pi&s;ed. Amelia was not only married, but the mo&s;t admired, the mo&s;t beloved, and the happie&s;t of human beings; an event which preyed &s;o ince&s;&s;antly on the &s;pirit of Mrs. Wormwood, that &s;he fell into a rapid decline, and ended, in a few months, her mi&s;chievous and unhappy life, a memorable axample, that the mo&s;t artful malignity may &s;ometimes procure for the ob|ject of its envy, that very happine&s;s which it labours to prevent!</P>
