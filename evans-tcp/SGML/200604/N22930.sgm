<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>ALTHOUGH Great Britain cannot vaunt of being an early Stoop to the &s;pirit of Di&s;|covery, but in that re&s;pect mu&s;t give place to the Dutch, yet it may with truth be a&s;&s;erted that &s;he has &s;ince far &s;urpa&s;&s;ed them, even in their own track. In the fifteenth and &s;ixteenth centuries, &s;ome &s;pirited enterpri&s;es were under|taken; but afterwards, the &s;pirit of Di&s;covery, &s;eemed to have totally &s;ub&s;ided, till about the year 1741, when by the command of his late Maje&s;ty, a voyage was undertaken under the di|rection of Captain Middleton, for di&s;covering a North-we&s;t pa&s;&s;age through Hud&s;on's Bay. In 1746, two &s;hips were &s;itted out by &s;ub&s;cription for the &s;ame purpo&s;e, under the command of Captains Smith and Moor. But it was re&s;erv|ed for his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty, by that munificence and patronage, which every liberal pur&s;uit meets with from him, to open friendly communica|tions, with &s;ome rece&s;&s;es of the Globe, hitherto unexplored. Captain (now Admiral) Byron, with the &s;hips Dolphin and Tamar, in 1764&mdash;6; Wallis and Carteret, with the Dolphin and Swal|low, in 1766&mdash;9; and Cook, with the Endea|vour, in 1768&mdash;71, and with the Re&s;olution and Adventure, in 1772&mdash;5, carried on a plan
<PB N="ii" REF="030274_0013_0FE56A630647E130">
of Di&s;covery, which it was the purpo&s;e of the pre&s;ent voyage to fini&s;h.</P>
<P>The intimate connection between the&s;e voya|ges, render it very nece&s;&s;ary, to &s;tate as &s;hort|ly as po&s;&s;ible, the objects accompli&s;hed by the preceding voyages, and how far the intention of the pre&s;ent one has been an&s;wered.</P>
<P>In general, it may be premi&s;ed, that the uni|ver&s;al object of all the voyages of the pre&s;ent reign, was to explore the va&s;t Ocean which ex|tends thro' the whole Southern Hemi&s;phere; as the re&s;ult of all the re&s;earches which had hi|therto been made might be ju&s;tly con&s;idered as ob&s;cure traditions, bold fictions, and plau&s;ible conjectures; that the&s;e five different circumna|vigations have an&s;wered a better purpo&s;e, is vi&s;ible from the following ob&s;ervations.</P>
<P>Falkland's I&s;lands in the South Atlantic Ocean were barely known to exi&s;t before An&s;on, and &s;o erroneous was even his idea of them, that he con&s;idered Pepys I&s;land and Falkland's I&s;les to be different places; there can be no doubt that they are the &s;ame, from Byron and M'Bride's joint te&s;timony: and of them we have as exact charts, as of the Coa&s;ts of Great Britain it&s;elf. Be&s;ides this, the di&s;covery of Sandwich Lands, the mo&s;t &s;outherly point yet known, and the certain accounts we have of the I&s;le of Georgia, are all to be attributed to Cook. Sir John Narborough gave us very imperfect accounts of Magalhaen's Straits,
<PB N="iii" REF="030274_0014_0FE56A64DE06FB30">
but Captains Byron, Wallis and Carteret, have furni&s;hed us with very accurate accounts of its coa&s;t, harbours, headlands, bays, i&s;lands, tides, &s;oundings, and currents, which are a very valuable acqui&s;ition, and &s;hould deter any future adventurers from &s;teer|ing that cour&s;e, e&s;pecially when a much &s;afer en|trance may be had to the Pacine Ocean, by doub|ling Cape Horn; this navigation Captain Cook has clearly &s;hewn, is by no means attended with &s;uch danger as might be &s;u&s;pected from the hard&s;hips and di&s;tre&s;&s;es which An&s;on a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> Pizarro &s;uffered there; and that, wholly owing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the &s;ea&s;on in which they were obliged to hazard it. But they have not only rendered the acce&s;s to the Pacific Ocean more ea&s;y, but have made us acquainted with a far greater part of its contents. As the Spani&s;h navigators had no further de&s;ign than to get a pa&s;&s;age to the Moluccas and other &s;pice i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lands, they never &s;teered further we&s;t-ward, by deviating from their track, except accidently, and if then they fell in with any i&s;lands, or made any di&s;coveries, little benefit was derived from them, their accounts being &s;o inaccurate as &s;ometimes to occa&s;ion a que&s;tion if &s;uch places exi&s;ted. Indeed, the va&s;t quantity of territory annexed to the Spani&s;h Crown, and the many rich mines never wrought rendered new acqui&s;itions by no means to be covet|ed; &s;o that, except the annual Manilla and Acapul|co &s;hip, they &s;eldom attempted to &s;teer acro&s;s the va&s;t gulph which &s;eparates A&s;ia from America.</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="030274_0015_0FE56A6666B52248">Other Navigators in the&s;e &s;eas, generally followed the Spani&s;h track: as indeed, their &s;ole bu&s;ine&s;s there was either for the purpo&s;e of commerce or ho&s;tili|ties with them. It is probable then, that after pa&s;|&s;ing Terra del Fuego, they would hold a notherly cour&s;e to the uninhabited I&s;land of Juan Fernande<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and thence &s;ail along the American coa&s;t from Chili to California, but they would either return to the Atlantic by the &s;ame cour&s;e, or &s;teer the track of the Phillipine galleons, as trade or rapine could be benefited by no other. In latter years, the en|terpri&s;ing Dutch have made &s;ome more certain and effectual re&s;earches in the &s;outhern latitudes of this ocean. In 1642 Ta&s;man's voyge will ever be remem|bered, for the di&s;coveries he made in a circuit, reach|ing from a high &s;outhern latitude, &s;o far North as New Guinea. Le Maine and Schouton in 1616, and Roggiuein in 1772, cro&s;&s;ing the &s;outh tropic, traver&s;ed this ocean, from Cape Horn to the Ea&s;t Indies. But even the di&s;coveries they made, can only be con&s;idered as a proof how much might be done.

<P>While we thus mu&s;t allow the Dutch to have been our harbingers, it is al&s;o to be ob&s;erved, that we afterwards went beyond them, even in their own track. And now &s;ucce&s;&s;ively his Maje&s;ty'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;hips have penetrated into the ob&s;cure&s;t rece&s;&s;es of

the &s;outh Pacific Ocean, will appear from a recital of their various and exten&s;ive operations, which have adju&s;ted the geography of &s;o con&s;iderable a part of the globe.</P>
<P>The &s;everal lands, mentioned to have been di&s;co|vered by preceding navigators, whether Spani&s;h or Dutch have been diligently &s;ought after; and mo&s;t of tho&s;e which appeared to be of any con&s;equence, found out and vi&s;ited; when every method was put in practice to correct former mi&s;takes, and &s;up|ply former deficiences. Thus, the famous Tierra Au&s;tralia del E&s;piritu Santo, which was always con|&s;idered a part of a &s;outhern continent, Captain Cook has defined its true po&s;ition and bounds, in the Archipelago of the New Hebrides.</P>
<P>But be&s;ides perfecting the di&s;coveries of their predece&s;&s;ors, our late navigators have added a long catalogue of their own, to enrich geographical knowledge. By repeatedly traver&s;ing the Pacific Ocean, within the &s;outh trophic, a &s;eeming end|le&s;s profu&s;ion of habitual &s;pots of land was found. I&s;lands inter&s;per&s;ed through the amazing &s;pace of eighty degrees of longitude, either &s;eparately &s;cat|tered, or grouped in numerous clu&s;ters; and &s;uch ample accounts have we received, both of them and their inhabitants, that, to make u&s;e of the Captains own words, we <HI>have left little more to be done in that part.</HI></P>
<P>Byron, Wallis, and Carteret, all contributed to|wards increa&s;ing our knowledge of the i&s;les in the Pacific Ocean, within the limits of the &s;outhern
<PB N="vi" REF="030274_0017_0FE56A6E55D52C20">
tropic; but how far that ocean extended to the we&s;t, by what lands it was bounded on that &s;ide, and the connections of tho&s;e lands with the former di&s;coveries, remained unknown, till Captain Cook, after his fir&s;t voyage, brought back a &s;atisfactory deci&s;ion to the&s;e que&s;tions. With wonderful &s;kill and per&s;everance, amid&s;t perplexities, difficultie and dangers, he traced this coa&s;t almo&s;t 2000 miles, from the 38&deg; of &s;outh latitude, acro&s;s the tropic, to its northern extremity, within 10&deg; and a half of the equinoctial, where it joined the land, alrea|dy explored by the Dutch, which they have deno|minated New Holland. Ta&s;man's di&s;coveries in the la&s;t century is now completed by Captain Cook; and we are fully acquainted with the circumference of this va&s;t body of land, which is ju&s;tly computed to be <HI>One Fifth of the Globe.</HI></P>
<P>Although Ta&s;man was the fir&s;t Di&s;coverer of New-Zealand, yet the &s;mall portion of it along which he &s;ailed, rendered his account of it &s;o im|perfect, that it was the general opinion of geogra|phers, that New-Zealand was part of a Souther<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Continent, running North and South from the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> to the 64&deg; of &s;outh latitude.

<P><PB N="vii" REF="030274_0018_0FE56A70707D8B30">Again, Captain Cook has put beyond doubt, that there is no junction between New-Holland, and New-Guinea, as he &s;ailed through between them. Though Mr. Dalrymple and others had di&s;covered &s;ome traces of &s;uch a pa&s;&s;age, yet the uncertainty of its practicability, as well as the importance of the di&s;covery, may be judged of, by reflecting that Mon&s;. Bougainville in 1768, rather than attempt &s;uch a pa&s;&s;age, &s;ailed ninety leagues about, while reduced to feed on &s;eal &s;kins from of the yards and riggings, for want of provi&s;ions.</P>
<P>For a &s;imilar di&s;covery to the preceding, we are indebted to Captain Carteret; <HI>viz.</HI> that the land named by Captain Dampier New Britain, con&s;i&s;ts of two large and &s;everal &s;maller i&s;lands, through which by Sir George's Channel, is a much better and &s;horter pa&s;&s;age, whether from the ea&s;t-ward or we&s;t-ward, than round all the I&s;lands and lands to the north-ward.</P>
<P>Byron, Wallis and Carteret were principally em|ployed in exploring the &s;outh Atlantic, and knew no more of the &s;outh Pacific, than accidentally occur|red in the direct tract they held: and as Captain Cook's main object in his fir&s;t voyage was to ob|&s;erve the tran&s;it of Venus at Otaheite, his anxiety to be there in proper time, preventing his vi&s;iting that part of the South Pacific, where the riches and mine of di&s;covery was &s;uppo&s;ed to exi&s;t. To put an end to all conjectures on this matter, Captain Cook was &s;ent out with the Re&s;olution and Adven|ture, in 1772, on the mo&s;t enlarged plan of di&s;co|very
<PB N="viii" REF="030274_0019_0FE56A71F84040D8">
hitherto attempted, <HI>viz.</HI> to circumnaviga<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> the Globe in high &s;outhern latitudes, and carefully to examine every corner of the &s;outh Pacific, at once to determine, whether a &s;outhern continent exi&s;ted in any acce&s;&s;ible part of the &s;outhern hemi&s;phere.</P>
<P>In attending Captain Cook in this &s;econd voyage together with his preceding one, we have the greate&s;t certainty to conclude, that many exten&s;ive conti|nents and i&s;lands mentioned by former navigators, were either large fields of ice, or exi&s;ted only in the chimerical heads of the pretended di&s;coverers.</P>
<P>It has been, by many, con&s;idered as an unan&s;wer|able argument; that a &s;outhern continent is nece&s;|&s;ary to pre&s;erve the due equilibrium; but from the thorough knowledge of the greater part of the &s;outhern hemi&s;phere, of which we are now po&s;&s;e&s;t, we may with certainty aver, that the equilibrium of the earth is maintained although the va&s;t track of &s;ea &s;ailed through, leaves no proportion for an equal quantity of land.</P>
<P>Thus though &s;ome preceding navigators have an|nexed more land to the known Globe, than Captain Cook&punc; to him belongs the honor of di&s;clo&s;ing the ex|tent of &s;ea covering its &s;urface. To con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ude our ob|&s;ervations on this &s;ubject we &s;hall make <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> with hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> own words: "I had now made the circut of the &s;outhern Ocean in a high latitude, and traver&s;ed it in &s;uch a manner as to leave not the lea&s;t room for there being a continent, unle&s;s near the pole, and out of the reach of navigation. By twice vi&s;iting the tropical &s;ea, I had not only &s;ettled the &s;itua|tion
<PB N="ix" REF="030274_0020_0FE56A99EB97F150">
of &s;ome old di&s;coveries, but made there many new ones, and left, I conceive, very little to be done in that part. Thus I flatter my&s;elf, that the intention of the voyage has, in every re&s;pect, been fully an&s;wered; the &s;outhern hemi&s;phere &s;uffici|ently explored; and a final end put to the &s;earch|ing after a &s;outhern continent, which has, at times, engro&s;&s;ed the attention of &s;ome of the maritime powers for near two centuries pa&s;t, and been a favourite theory among&s;t geographers of all na|tions.</P>
<P>From the general &s;ketch we have already given of the preceding voyages, it is evident that, though the utmo&s;t acce&s;&s;ible extremities of the &s;outhern hemi&s;phere had been vi&s;ited, yet our own had not; and it remained a que&s;tion, how far a northern pa&s;&s;age between the Atlantic and Pacific Ocean was practicable, either by &s;ailing we&s;tward round North America, or ea&s;tward, round A&s;ia.</P>
<P>Could &s;uch a pa&s;&s;age be effected, it would great|ly &s;horten pa&s;&s;ages to Japan, China, and the Ea&s;t-Indies in general.

different navigators had experienced, the obtaining a northerly pa&s;&s;age was an object &s;o de&s;irable, that it was determined to bring the matter to a cer|tainty, by &s;ending out Captain Cook once more on this important errand.

As al&s;o a reward of five thou&s;and pounds, to any &s;hip that &s;hould approach to within 1&deg; of the North Pole. In the beginning of &s;ummer 1776, Captain Picker&s;gill was appointed Commander of the armed brig the Lion, and ordered to proceed to Davis's Straits, to protect the Briti&s;h fi&s;hers; and in order to facilitate Captain Cook's expedi|tion, to proceed up Baffin's Bay, and make &s;uch charts and take &s;uch views of the &s;everal bays, harbours, &amp;c. as might be u&s;eful to navigators and others; and to be careful to return in the fall of the year. Picker&s;gill failed in executing his commi&s;&s;ions, and in March following Lieutenant Young was appointed to &s;ucceed him.</P>
<P>As the object of this voyage is immediately con|nected with that of Captain Cook, we have an|nexed a &s;ummary of his in&s;tructions, dated March 13th, 1777.</P>

<P>But this expedition was of no &s;ervice; Young was found more calculated to a&s;&s;i&s;t in the glory of a victory, than explore icy mountains.</P>
<P>On examining the&s;e in&s;tructions, it may be que&s;tioned, why Captain Cook was not directed to commence his &s;earch, before he arrived at 65&deg;? Why not examine Hud&s;on's Bay, on our &s;ide of America? Why was the we&s;tern &s;ea of John de Fuca in latitude 47&deg; and 48&deg;; the Archipelago of St. Lazarus of Admiral de Fonte from 50&deg; to 55&deg;; and the rivers and lakes to the north ea&s;t|ward, neglected? It may ea&s;ily be &s;hewn that the&s;e pretended di&s;coveries are mere fictions, and that the Orders, not to begin his &s;earch before the
<PB N="xxi" REF="030274_0032_0FE56AAB67051ED8">
65&deg; of north latitude was founded upon a tho|rough knowledge of the coa&s;t to the &s;outh-ward of that point.</P>
<P>Captain Middleton, the commander of the ex|pedition in Hud&s;on's Bay, in 1741, and 42, had entertained a notion of the probability of di&s;cover|ing a pa&s;&s;age to the Pacific, and in &s;earch of it, had proceeded further north than any of his pre|dece&s;&s;ors; but he found it utterly impracticable. Mr. Dobbs, however, the patron of the enter|pri&s;e, upon the information of &s;ome of Middle|ton's officers, ventured to accu&s;e him of mi&s;re|pre&s;enting facts, and that from his own accounts of an inlet running we&s;t-ward in latitude 65&deg; or 66&deg; it was evident he had not taken proper pains. To be at a point upon this, he prevailed upon a &s;ociety of merchants and gentlemen to fit out the Dobbs and California to inve&s;tigate this very inlet, having previou&s;ly got the <HI>L.</HI> 20,000 premium <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">.</P>
<P>But this voyage abundantly e&s;tabli&s;hed Captain Middleton's opinion; for the &s;uppo&s;ed &s;traits was found to be a fre&s;h water river. So high had expectation been rai&s;ed in favour of this &s;uppo&s;ed pa&s;&s;age, that notwith&s;tanding the failure of this expedition, it was &s;till con&s;idered as attainable. Two places were mentioned as the mo&s;t probable, the one Che&s;terfield or Bowden's inlet, in lati|tude 63&deg; or 64&deg;, the other Repul&s;e Bay in lati|tude 67&deg;. This la&s;t, the committee who directed
<PB N="xxii" REF="030274_0033_0FE56A880A060658">
the enterpri&s;e, declared to be impracticable, upon the te&s;timony of Mr. Ellis, the commander of the Dobbs, and &s;ome of his officers; and the for|mer has been fully explored, and traced 170 miles up the country, to a large lake from whence it takes its ri&s;e, in two different voyages by Captain Chri&s;topher, in the &s;loop Churchill in the years 1761 and 62.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e &s;ea voyages, the matter is much elucidated by the journey of Mr. Hearne, who was &s;ent out by the Hud&s;on's Bay company to travel over land, as far as the <HI>Copper Mine River,</HI> which had been much &s;poken of by Mr. Dobbs and other favourers of the &s;cheme. He &s;et out in December 1770, from Fort Prince of Wales, on Churchill's River lat. 58&deg; 50&prime;, and his tran&s;|actions are pre&s;erved in his written journal. It is much to be wi&s;hed that this journal were publi&s;h|ed, as it contains a very di&s;mal account of the wretched &s;ituation of the mi&s;erions, inhabitants of that part of the globe. His general cour&s;e was to the north-we&s;t. In June 1771, when at a place called <HI>Conge Catha who Chaga,</HI> he determined by two good ob&s;ervations, that this place is &s;ituated 24&deg; 2&prime; we&s;t longitude of Churchill River, and in 68&deg; 46&prime; north latitude. On the 13th of July, he reached Copper Mine River; and contrary to the idea he had been left to form of it, &s;ound it &s;carce|ly navigable for a canoe. Without entering par|ticularly into the account Mr. Hearne gives of this
<PB N="xxiii" REF="030274_0034_0FE56AACEEA19388">
river, it is &s;ufficient for our purpo&s;e to mention, that he found it by no means navigable for the &s;malle&s;t ve&s;&s;els, and impo&s;&s;ible to be made &s;o. On our general chart, the particular &s;ituation of this river, as well as the country in general, through which Mr. Hearne pa&s;&s;ed, is accurately laid down. In fine, Mr. Hearne's travelling 1300 miles before he arrived at the &s;ea, makes it clear that the continents of North America &s;tretches from Hud&s;on's Bay, at lea&s;t that di&s;tance to the north-we&s;t, while his mo&s;t we&s;terly di&s;tance from Hud&s;on's Bay was about 600 miles; and the In|dians who attended him as guides were convinced that there exi&s;ted a va&s;t track of continent, &s;tretch|ing on in the &s;ame direction. What we have now mentioned, being &s;ufficiently known to the fir&s;t Lord of the Admiralty, was a good rea&s;on for his ordering Captain Cook to commence his &s;earch in latitude 65&deg;, and not more to the &s;outh|ward. But if there are any, we are &s;till inclined to think it &s;hould have begun earlier. We beg leave to recommend to them a peru&s;al of the Spani&s;h voyages, particularly that on the coa&s;t of America in 1775, publi&s;hed by Mr. Danes Bar|rington. In the general &s;ketch we have now given of the pre&s;ent and preceding voyages, a pretty di&s;tinct idea may be formed, of what was intend|ed to be done, and what was really accompli&s;hed. The benefits ari&s;ing from them may be enumera|ted as follows:</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="xxiv" REF="030274_0035_0FE56A89E69B4918">1. All vi&s;ionary &s;peculators and &s;chemers, &s;uch as Bu&s;&s;on, Campbell, and de Bro&s;&s;es, will find few votaries to &s;upport their airy fanciful dreams of trea&s;ures and paradi&s;es in the&s;e &s;eas, as Captain Cook has &s;ufficiently inve&s;tigated what is and what is not to be found there; &s;o, many impracticable undertakings which would probably have taken place, will be entirely prevented.</P>
<P N="2">2. But unprofitable &s;earches will not only be di&s;couraged, but the di&s;tre&s;&s;es and inconveniencies attending the navigation of the&s;e &s;eas, in a great mea&s;ure prevented. The exact &s;ituation of the different i&s;lands are properly laid down; rocky &s;hores, perplexing currents, dangerous &s;hoals, and narrow &s;traits accurately de&s;cribed; be&s;ides many other advantages, to enumerate which, it would be nece&s;&s;ary to tran&s;cribe great part of the jour|nals of our &s;everal Commanders. By thus le&s;&s;en|ing the danger of the&s;e voyages, a &s;cene of com|merce comes in view, that in a cour&s;e of years will probably come to &s;uch a height as is impo&s;|&s;ible for us at pre&s;ent to have any conception of; nay, in our own day, it is highly probable that &s;ome &s;peedy advances will be made to form &s;ome commercial e&s;tabli&s;hments in the &s;outh Pacific; at lea&s;t, if we do not, we have taught the Ru&s;&s;ians and Spaniards &s;ome important le&s;&s;ons in the &s;kin|trade, and otherwi&s;e, which they will not fail to improve.</P>

<P>Convinced, by comparing them&s;elves to their Engli&s;h vi&s;itors, of their extreme inferiority, they will probably endeavour to emerge from it, and to ri&s;e nearer to a level with tho&s;e who left

behind them &s;o many proofs of their genero&s;ity and humanity. The u&s;eful animals and vege|tables introduced among&s;t them will certainly contribute to the comforts and enjoyments of life.</P>
<P>When Great-Britain was fir&s;t vi&s;ited by the Phoenicians, the inhabitants were painted &s;avages, much le&s;s civilized than tho&s;e of Tongataboo, or Otaheite; and it is not impo&s;&s;ible, but that our late voyages may, in proce&s;s of time, &s;pread the ble&s;&s;ings of civilization among&s;t the numerous i&s;landers of the South Pacific Ocean, and be the means of aboli&s;hing their abominable repa&s;ts, and almo&s;t equally abominable &s;acrifices.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>ON the 10th of February, 1776, Captain Cook went on board his Maje&s;ty's &s;loop the Re|&s;olution, and hoi&s;ted the pendant, having receiv|ed a commi&s;&s;ion to command her the preceding day. The Di&s;covery, of three hundred tons, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, at the &s;ame time, prepared for the &s;ervice,
<PB N="2" REF="030274_0049_0FE56AE0EE595B40">
and Captain Clerke appointed to the command of her. It may be nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve, that Captain Clerke had been Captain Cook's Second Lieutenant on board the Re&s;olution, in his &s;econd voyage round the world.</P>
<P>The&s;e two &s;hips were then equipping in the dock at Deptford, for a voyage to make farther di&s;coveries in the Pacific Ocean, under the di|rection of Captain Cook.</P>
<P>The Re&s;olution was hauled into the river on the 9th of March to complete her rigging, and take in &s;tores and provi&s;ions for the voyage. Both &s;hips, indeed, were abundantly &s;upplied with every thing requi&s;ite for a voyage of &s;uch duration. We &s;ailed on the 29th of May, and arrived the next day at Long Reach, where our powder and &s;hot, and other ordnance &s;tores, were re|ceived.</P>
<P>On the 8th of June, while we lay in Long Reach, we had the &s;atisfaction of a vi&s;it from the Earl of Sandwich, Sir Hugh Palli&s;er, and others of the Board of Admiralty, to examine whether every thing had been completed pur&s;uant to their orders, and to the convenience of tho&s;e who were to embark. They honoured Captain Cook with their company to dinner on that day; and were &s;aluted, on their coming on board, and on their going a&s;hore, with &s;eventeen guns and three cheers.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="030274_0050_0FE56AC875674F78">To convey &s;ome permanent benefit to the in|habitants of Otaheite, and of the other i&s;lands which we might happen to vi&s;it, his Maje&s;ty commanded &s;ome u&s;eful animals to be taken out. On the 10th we took on board a bull, two cows with their calves, and &s;ome &s;heep; with hay and corn for their &s;upport. We were al&s;o furni&s;hed with a &s;ufficient quantity of our valuable Euro|pean garden &s;eeds, which might add fre&s;h &s;up|plies of food to the vegetable productions of our newly di&s;covered i&s;lands.</P>
<P>Both the &s;hips, by order of the Board of Ad|miralty, were amply &s;upplied with an exten&s;ive a&s;&s;ortment of iron tools and trinkets, to facilitate a friendly commerce and intercour&s;e with the in|habitants of &s;uch new countries as we might di&s;|cover. With re&s;pect to our own wants, nothing was refu&s;ed us that might be conducive to health, comfort or convenience.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e at the head of the naval department were equally &s;olicitous to render our vo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">age of public utility; accordingly we received on board, the next day, variety of a&s;tronomical and nautical in&s;truments, which the Board of Longitude in|tru&s;ted to Captain Cook and Mr. King, his Se|cond Lieutenant; they having engaged to &s;upply the place of a profe&s;&s;ed ob&s;ervator. The board, likewi&s;e, put into their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion the time-keeper, which Captain Cook had carried out in his la&s;t voyage, and which had performed &s;o well. It
<PB N="4" REF="030274_0051_0FE56AE290C41570">
was con&s;tructed by Mr. Kendal, and was a copy of Mr. Harri&s;on's. Another time-keeper, and the &s;ame a&s;&s;ortment of a&s;tronomical and other in&s;truments were put on board the Di&s;covery, for the u&s;e of Mr. William Bailey, a diligent and &s;kilful ob&s;ervator, who was engaged to embark with Captain Clerke.</P>
<P>Mr. Ander&s;on, Surgeon to Captain Cook, added to his profe&s;&s;ional abilities a great profi|ciency in natural hi&s;tory. He had already vi|&s;ited the South-Sea I&s;lands in the &s;ame &s;hip, and enabled the Captain to enrich his relation of the preceding voyage with u&s;eful and valuable re|marks.</P>
<P>Though &s;everal young men, among the &s;ea|officers, were capable of being employed in con|&s;tructing charts, drawing plans, and taking views of the coa&s;ts and head-lands, Mr. Webber was engaged to embark with Captain Cook, for the purpo&s;e of &s;upplying the defects of written accounts, by taking accurate and ma&s;terly draw|ings of the mo&s;t memorable &s;cenes of our tran&s;|actions.</P>
<P>The nece&s;&s;ary preparations being completed, Captain Cook received orders to proceed to Ply|mouth, and to take the Di&s;covery under his command. In con&s;equence of which, he order|ed Captain Clerke to carry his &s;hip al&s;o <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ound to Plymouth.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="030274_0052_0FE56ACA03904EC8">The Re&s;olution, with the Di&s;covery in com|pany, &s;ailed from Long Reach on the 15th of June, and anchored at the Nore the &s;ame even|ing. The Di&s;covery proceeded the next day in obedience to Captain Cook's order, and the Re|&s;olution remained at the Nore till Captain Cook, who was then in London, &s;hould join her.</P>
<P>It being our intention to touch at Otaheite and the S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y I&s;lands, it had been determined to carry Omai back to his native country; accord|ingly Captain Cook and he &s;et out from London early on the 24th, and reached Chatham between ten and eleven o'clock, where they dined with Commi&s;&s;ioner Proby, who afterwards ordered his yacht to convey them to Sheerne&s;s, where the Captain's boat was waiting to take them on board the Re&s;olution.</P>
<P>Though Omai left London with &s;ome degree of regret, when he reflected upon the favours and indulgencies he had received, yet, when mention was made of his own i&s;lands, his eyes &s;parkled with joy. He entertained the highe&s;t ideas of this country and its inhabitants; but the plea&s;ing pro&s;pect of returning home, loaded with what would be deemed invaluable trea&s;ures there, and of obtaining a di&s;tingui&s;hed &s;uperiority among his countrymen, operated &s;o far as to &s;uppre&s;s every unea&s;y &s;en&s;ation, and when he got on board the &s;hip, he appeared to be quite happy.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="030274_0053_0FE5489022DC1A50">Omai was furni&s;hed by his Maje&s;ty, with quantities of every article that were &s;uppo&s;ed to be in e&s;timation at Otaheite. He al&s;o received &s;everal pre&s;ents from Lord Sandwich, Mr. Banks, and many others. Every method had, indeed, been employed, during his abode in England, and at his departure, to make him the in&s;tru|ment of conveying to his countrymen, an exalted opinion of Briti&s;h greatne&s;s and genero&s;ity.</P>
<P>About noon on the 25th we weighed anchor, and made &s;ail for the Downs, with a gentle breeze at north-we&s;t by we&s;t. At nine the &s;ame day we anchored, with the North Foreland bearing &s;outh by ea&s;t, and Margate Point &s;outh-we&s;t by &s;outh.</P>
<P>On the 26th, at two o'clock, we weighed, and &s;tood round the Foreland; and at eight o'clock the &s;ame morning anchored in the Downs. Here Captain Cook received two boats on board, which had been built for him at Deal; and the next day, at two o'clock in the afternoon, we got under &s;ail, but the breeze &s;oon died away, and we anchored again. At ten o'clock the &s;ame night we weighed again, and proceeded down the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">.</P>
<P>We anchored at Plymouth Sound on the 30th, at three o'clock in the afternoon. The Di&s;covery had arrived there three days before. We &s;aluted Admiral Amh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r&s;t, who&s;e flag was flying on board the Ocean, and he returned the compliment.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="030274_0054_0FE56ACB8BEE69B0">We were employed on the 1&s;t and 2d of July in replacing the water and provi&s;ions we had ex|pended, and in receiving on board a &s;upply of port wine. On the 8th Captain Cook received his in&s;tructions for the voyage, and an order to proceed to the Cape of Good Hope with the Re&s;olution; with directions al&s;o to leave an order for Captain Clerke to follow him, as &s;oon as he &s;hould join his &s;hip, he being at that time in London.</P>
<P>The officers and men on board the Re&s;olution (including marines) were one hundred and twelve, and tho&s;e on board the Di&s;covery were eighty.</P>
<P>On the 10th of July the proper per&s;ons came on board, and paid the officers and crew up to the 30th of la&s;t month. The petty officers and &s;ea|men received al&s;o two months wages in advance. Such indulgence to the latter is cu&s;tomary; but the payment of what was due to the &s;uperior of|ficers, was in con&s;ideration of our peculiar &s;itua|tion, to enable us to defray the expence of fur|ni&s;hing our&s;elves with nece&s;&s;aries for a voyage of &s;uch uncommon duration.</P>
<P>In the morning of the 11th, Captain Cook de|livered into the hands of Mr. Burney, Fir&s;t Lieu|tenant of the Di&s;covery, Captain Clerke's &s;ailing orders; a copy of which he al&s;o left with the com|manding officer of his Maje&s;ty's &s;hips at Ply|mouth, to be delivered to the Captain on his ar|rival. In the afternoon we weighed with the ebb,
<PB N="8" REF="030274_0055_0FE56AE9F80CC140">
and got out beyond all the &s;hipping in the Sound, where we were detained mo&s;t of the following day. At eight o'clock in the evening, we weigh|ed again, and &s;tood out of the Sound, with a gentle breeze at north-we&s;t by we&s;t.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>SOON after we came out of Plymouth Sound, the wind came more we&s;terly, and blew fre&s;h, which obliged us to ply down the channel; and we were not off the Lizard till the 14th at eight in the evening.</P>
<P>On the 16th at noon, the light-hou&s;e of St. Agnes, on the I&s;les of Scilly, bore north-we&s;t by we&s;t, di&s;tant about &s;even or eight miles; and on the 17th and 18th, we were off U&s;hant.</P>
<P>On the 19th we &s;tood we&s;tward till eight o'clock in the morning, when the wind &s;hifted, and we
<PB N="9" REF="030274_0056_0FE56ACD332742B8">
tacked and &s;tretched to the &s;outhward: here we beheld nine &s;ail of large &s;hips, which we &s;up|po&s;ed to be French men of war. On the 22d, at ten in the morning, we &s;aw Cape Ortegal about four leagues di&s;tant.</P>
<P>We had calm weather on the 22d and 23d, and on the afternoon of the 24th, we pa&s;&s;ed Cape Fi|ni&s;terre, with a fine gale at north-north-ea&s;t.</P>
<P>Captain Cook determined to touch at Tene|riffe, to get a &s;upply of hay and corn for the &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence of his animals on board, as well as the u&s;ual refre&s;hments for our&s;elves. We &s;aw Tene|riffe on the 31&s;t of July, at four in the afternoon; and at day-light on the fir&s;t of Augu&s;t, we &s;ailed round the ea&s;t point of that i&s;land, and anchored on the &s;outh &s;ide, in the road of Santa Cruz, about eight o'clock, in twenty-three fathoms water.</P>
<P>There were, riding in this road, a French fri|gate, two French brigantines, an Engli&s;h brigan|tine, and fourteen &s;ail of Spani&s;h &s;hips.</P>
<P>Immediately after we had anchored, we re|ceived a vi&s;it from the ma&s;ter of the port, who a&s;ked the &s;hip's name. Upon his retiring, Cap|tain Cook &s;ent an officer a&s;hore, to pre&s;ent his re&s;pects to the Governor, and a&s;k his permi&s;&s;ion to take in water, and to purcha&s;e &s;uch articles as were thought nece&s;&s;ary. The Governor very po|litely complied with Captain Cook's reque&s;t, and &s;ent an officer on board to compliment him on his arrival. In the afternoon Captain Cook wait|ed
<PB N="10" REF="030274_0057_0FE56AEBEEE17AE8">
upon him, accompanied by &s;ome of his of|ficers; and, before he returned to his &s;hip, be|&s;poke &s;ome corn and &s;traw, ordered a quantity of wine, and made an agreement for a &s;upply of water.</P>
<P>The Road of Santa Cruz is &s;ituated on the &s;outh-ea&s;t &s;ide of the i&s;land, before the town of the &s;ame name. It is &s;aid to be the principal road of Te|neriffe for &s;helter, capacity, and the goodne&s;s of its bottom.</P>
<P>The water to &s;upply the &s;hipping, and for the u&s;e of the inhabitants of Santa Cruz, is derived from a rivulet that runs from the hills, which is conveyed into the town in wooden troughs. As the&s;e troughs were at this time repairing, fre&s;h water was extremely &s;carce.</P>
<P>From the appearance of the country about Santa Cruz, it might naturally be concluded that Teneriffe is a barren &s;pot: we were convinced however, from the ample &s;upplies we received, that it not only produced &s;ufficient to &s;upply its own inhabitants, but al&s;o enough to &s;pare for vi&s;itors. Though wine is the chief produce of the i&s;land, beef may be had at about three-pence &s;terling a pound; the oxen, however, are &s;mall, lean, and boney. Sheep, goats, hogs, and poul|try, may be had on terms equally rea&s;onable. A great variety of fruits are to be had in plenty, as pears, figs, grapes, mulberries, mu&s;k-melons, &amp;c. be&s;ides others that were not then in &s;ea&s;on. The
<PB N="11" REF="030274_0058_0FE56AD18ED4F388">
pumpkins, potatoes, and onions, which grow here, are excellent.</P>
<P>Indian corn is produced on this i&s;land, and is &s;old at about three &s;hillings and &s;ix-pence per bu&s;hel: the fruits and vegetables are, in gene|ral, very cheap. Though the inhabitants are but indifferently &s;upplied with fi&s;h by the adjoining &s;eas, they are engaged in a con&s;iderable fi&s;hery on the coa&s;t of Barbary, and the produce of it &s;ells at a very moderate price.</P>
<P>Teneriffe is certainly a more eligible place than Madeira, for &s;hips to touch at which are bound on long voyages; but the wine of the latter is infinitely &s;uperior to that of the former: the dif|ference of their prices is almo&s;t as con&s;iderable as their qualities, for the be&s;t Teneriffe wine was &s;old for twelve pounds a pipe, whereas a pipe of the be&s;t Maderia was worth con&s;iderably more than double that &s;um.</P>
<P>Behind the town of Santa Cruz, the country ri&s;es gradually to a moderate height; afterwards it continues to ri&s;e &s;outh we&s;tward towards the celebrated pic of Teneriffe. But we were much di&s;appointed in our expectations with re&s;pect to its appearance <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In Sparta's Hi&s;tory of the Royal Society, page 200, &amp;c. is an account of a journey to the top of the pic of Teneriffe. A modern traveller, viz. the Chevalier de Borda, who mea|&s;ured the height of this mountain in Augu&s;t 1776, makes it 123<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">0 Engli&s;h feet.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="030274_0059_0FE56AED7996DBE0">The i&s;land, ea&s;tward of Santa Cruz, appears perfectly barren. Ridges of high hills run to|wards the &s;ea, between which are deep vallies, terminating at mountains that run acro&s;s and are higher than the former.</P>
<P>On the 1&s;t of Augu&s;t in the afternoon, Mr. Ander&s;on (Captain Cook's &s;urgeon) went on &s;hore to one of the&s;e vallies, intending to reach the top of the remoter hills, but time would not permit him to get farther than their foot. The lower hills produce great quantities of the <HI>euphorbia canarien&s;is.</HI> The people on the &s;pot imagine its juice to be &s;o cau&s;tic as to erode the &s;kin; but Mr. Ander&s;on convinced them to the contrary, by thru&s;ting his finger into a plant full of it. The inhabitants dry the bu&s;hes of <HI>euphorbia,</HI> and carry them home for fuel.</P>
<P>Santa Cruz, though not large, is a well-built city. Their churches have not a magnificent ap|pearance without, but they are decent and tole|rably hand&s;ome within.</P>
<P>Almo&s;t facing the &s;tone pier, which runs into the &s;ea from the town, is a marble column, lately erected, enriched with human figures which re|flect honour to the &s;tatuary.</P>
<P>On the 2d of Augu&s;t, in the afternoon, Mr. Ander&s;on and three others hired mules to ride to the city of Laguna, about the di&s;tance of four miles from Santa Cruz. They arrived there be|tween five and &s;ix in the evening, but the &s;ight
<PB N="13" REF="030274_0060_0FE56AD477178BD0">
of it did not reward us for our trouble, as the roads were very bad, and our cattle but indiffer|ent. Though the place is exten&s;ive, it hardly de&s;erves to be dignified with the name of a city. There is &s;ome good hou&s;es, but the di&s;po&s;ition of the &s;treets is very irregular. Laguna is larger than Santa Cruz, but much inferior to it in ap|pearance.</P>
<P>The road from Santa Cruz to Laguna, runs up a &s;teep barren hill; but, lower down, we &s;aw &s;ome fig-trees and corn-fields. The corn, how|ever, is not produced here without great labour, the ground being greatly encumbered with &s;tones. Nothing el&s;e pre&s;ented it&s;elf, de&s;erving notice, except a few aloe plants in flower on the &s;ide of the road.</P>
<P>The laborious work in this i&s;land is chiefly performed by mules, hor&s;es being &s;carce, and re|&s;erved for the u&s;e of the officers. Oxen are al&s;o much employed here. Some hawks and parrots wer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;een, which were natives of the i&s;land; as al&s;o the &s;ea-&s;wallow, &s;ea-gulls, partridges, &s;wal|lows, canary-birds, and black-birds. There are al&s;o lizards, locu&s;ts, and three or four &s;orts of dragon flies.</P>
<P>Mr. Ander&s;on was informed, by a gentleman of acknowledged veracity, that a &s;hrub is com|mon here, agreeing exactly with the de&s;cription given by Linnaeus of the tea &s;hrub, as growing in China and Japan. It is con&s;idered as a weed,
<PB N="14" REF="030274_0061_0FE56AEF070D5FC8">
and large quantities are rooted out of the vine|yards every year. The Spaniards, however, who inhabit the i&s;land, &s;ometimes make u&s;e of it, and a&s;cribe to it all the qualities of the tea imported from China.</P>
<P>The &s;ame gentleman mentioned to Mr. Ander|&s;on another botanical curio&s;ity, which is called the <HI>impregnated lemon.</HI> It is a di&s;tinct and per|fect lemon enclo&s;ed within another.</P>
<P>A certain &s;ort of grape growing here, is deem|ed an excellent remedy in phthi&s;ical complaints. The air and climate are remarkably healthful, and particularly adapted to afford relief in &s;uch complaints. By re&s;iding at different heights in the i&s;land, it is in the power of any one to pro|cure &s;uch a temperature of air as may be be&s;t &s;uited to his con&s;titution. He may continue where it is mild and &s;alubrious, or he may a&s;cend till the cold becomes intolerable. No per&s;on, it is &s;aid, can live comfortably within a mile of the perpendicular height of the pic, after the month of Augu&s;t.</P>
<P>Smoke continually i&s;&s;ues from near the top of the pic, but they have had no earthquake or erup|tion &s;ince 1704, when the port of Garrachica was de&s;troyed, being filled up by the rivers of burn|ing lava that flowed into it; and hou&s;es are now built, where &s;hips formerly lay at anchor.</P>
<P>The trade of Teneriffe is very con&s;iderable, forty thou&s;and pipes of wine being annually made
<PB N="15" REF="030274_0062_0FE56AD660DF5438">
there; which is con&s;umed in the i&s;land, or made into brandy, and &s;ent to the Spani&s;h We&s;t-Indies. Indeed the wine is the only con&s;iderable article of the foreign commerce of Teneriffe, unle&s;s we reckon the large quantities of filtering &s;tones brought from Grand Canary.</P>
<P>The race of inhabitants found here when the Spaniards di&s;covered the Canaries, are no longer a di&s;tinct people, having intermarried with the Spani&s;h &s;ettlers; their de&s;cendants, however, may be known, from their being remarkably tall, &s;trong, and large-boned. The men are tawny, and the woman are pale. The inhabitants, in general, of Teneriffe, are decent, grave, and ci|vil; retaining that &s;olemn ca&s;t which di&s;tingui&s;hes tho&s;e of their country from others. Though we are not of opinion that our manners are &s;imilar to tho&s;e of the Spaniards, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Omai declared, he did not think there was much difference. He &s;aid, indeed, that they did not appear to be &s;o friendly as the Engli&s;h; and that their per&s;ons nearly re|&s;embled tho&s;e of his countrymen.</P>

<P>On the 10th, at nine o'clock in the evening, we &s;aw the i&s;land of Bonavi&s;ta bearing &s;outh, di&s;tant about a league; though we then thought our|&s;elves much farther off, but it &s;oon appeared that we were mi&s;taken; for after hauling to the ea&s;t|ward, to clear the &s;unken rocks that lie near the &s;outh-ea&s;t point of the i&s;land, we found our&s;elves clo&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> upon them, and bearly weathered the break|ers. Our &s;ituation was, for &s;ome minutes, &s;o very alarming, that Captain Cook did not chu&s;e to &s;ound, as that might have increa&s;ed the danger, without any po&s;&s;ibility of le&s;&s;ening it.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="030274_0064_0FE56AD849A26E40">Having cleared the rocks, we &s;teered between Bonavi&s;ta and the i&s;land of Mayo, intending to look into Port Praya for the Di&s;covery, as Captain Cook had told Captain Clerke that he &s;hould touch there. At one o'clock we &s;aw the rocks &s;outh-we&s;t of Bonavi&s;ta, bearing &s;outh-ea&s;t, di&s;tant three or four leagues.</P>
<P>On Monday the 12th, at &s;ix o'clock in the morning, the i&s;le of Mayo bore &s;outh-&s;outh-ea&s;t, di&s;tant four or five leagues. We &s;ounded, and found ground at &s;ixty fathoms. At the di&s;tance of three or four miles from this i&s;land, we &s;aw not the lea&s;t appearance of vegetation; nothing pre&s;ented it&s;elf to our view, but that lifele&s;s brown, &s;o common in unwooded countries under the tor|rid zone.</P>
<P>During our continuance among the&s;e i&s;lands, we had gentle breezes of wind, varying from the &s;outh-ea&s;t to ea&s;t, and &s;ome calms. On the 13th, at nine o'clock in the morning, we arrived be|fore Port Praya, in the i&s;land of St. Jago, where two Dutch Ea&s;t-India &s;hips, and a &s;mall brigan|tine, were at anchor. The Di&s;covery not being there, we did not go in, but &s;tood to the &s;outh|ward.</P>
<P>We lo&s;t the north-ea&s;t trade-wind, the day af|ter we left the Cape de Verde i&s;lands; and, on the 30th, got that which blows from the &s;outh-ea&s;t. The wind, during this interval, was principally in the &s;outh-we&s;t quarter. It generally blew a
<PB N="18" REF="030274_0065_0FE56AF81305A100">
gentle breeze, but &s;ometimes fre&s;h, and in &s;qualls. We had few calms, and tho&s;e of &s;hort duration. Between the latitude of 12&deg;, and of 7&deg; north, the weather was very gloomy, and frequently rainy; in&s;omuch, that we were enabled to &s;ave as much water as filled the greate&s;t part of our empty ca&s;ks.</P>
<P>Every bad con&s;equence is to be apprehended from the&s;e rains, and the clo&s;e &s;ultry weather ac|companying them. Commanders of &s;hips ought carefully to purify the air between decks with fires and &s;moke, and to oblige the people to change their cloaths at every opportunity. The&s;e precautions were &s;trictly ob&s;erved on board the Re&s;olution and Di&s;covery; and we enjoyed the advantage of it, having fewer &s;ick than on either of Captain Cook's former voyages. Our &s;hip, however, was very leaky in all her upper works. The &s;ultry weather had opened her &s;eams &s;o wide, that the rain-water pa&s;&s;ed through as it fell. The officers in the gun-room were driven from their cabins, by the water that came through the &s;ides, and hardly a man could lie dry in his bed. The caulkers were employed to repair the&s;e defects, as &s;oon as we got into fair &s;ettled weather; but Captain Cook would not tru&s;t them over the &s;ides while we were at &s;ea.</P>
<P>On the 1&s;t of September, we cro&s;&s;ed the equa|tor, in the longitude of 27&deg; 38&prime; we&s;t, and pa&s;&s;ed the afternoon in performing the old ceremony of

d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">king tho&s;e, who had not cro&s;&s;ed the equator before. On the 8th, we were a little to the &s;outh|ward of Cape St. Augu&s;tine. We proceeded on our voyage, without any remarkable occurrence, till the 6th of October. Being then in the lati|tude of 35&deg; 15&prime; &s;outh, longitude 7&deg; 45&prime; we&s;t, we alternately met with light airs and calms for three &s;ucce&s;&s;ive days. For &s;ome days before we had &s;een albatro&s;&s;es, and pintadoes, and we then &s;aw three penguins. In con&s;equence of this we found|ed, but found no ground with a line of one hun|dred and fifty fathoms. We &s;hot a few birds, one of which was a black petrel, about the &s;ize of a crow.</P>
<P>In the evening of the 8th, a bird, which the &s;ailors call a noddy, &s;ettled on our rigging, and was taken. It was larger than a common Engli&s;h black-bird, and nearly of the &s;ame colour, ex|cept the upper part of the head, which was white. It was web-footed, had black legs, and a long black bill. Though it is &s;aid th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e birds never venture far from land, we knew of none nearer our &s;tation than Gough's or Richmond i&s;land, which could not be le&s;s than one hundred leagues. But as the Atlantic ocean, &s;outhward of us, has been but little frequented, there may po&s;&s;ibly be more i&s;lands than we know of.</P>
<P>A fre&s;h gale from the north-we&s;t &s;ucceeded this calm weather, which continued two days. Af|terwards we had variable light <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> for about

twenty-four hours, when the north-we&s;t wind returned, and bl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">w fre&s;h. On the 17th we &s;aw the Cape of Good Hope, and, on the 18th, an|chored in Table-bay, in four fathoms water.</P>
<P>After receiving the u&s;ual vi&s;it from the Ma&s;ter|attendant and the Surgeon, Captain Cook &s;ent an officer to Baron Plettenberg, the Governor, and &s;aluted the garri&s;on with thirteen guns, and was complimented in return with the &s;ame number. Two French Ea&s;t-India &s;hips were in the bay, the one outward, and the other homeward-bound.</P>
<P>After having &s;aluted, Captain Cook went on &s;hore, accompanied by &s;ome of his officers, and waited on the Governor, the Lieutenant-governor, the Fi&s;cal, and the Commander of the troops. The&s;e Gentlemen received Captain Cook with the greate&s;t civility; and the Governor, in particu|lar voluntarily promi&s;ed him every a&s;&s;i&s;tance that the place afforded. Before Captain Cook return|ed on board, he ordered fre&s;h meat, greens, &amp;c. to be provided every day for the &s;hip's company.</P>
<P>On the 22d we fixed our tents and ob&s;ervatory; the next day we began to ob&s;erve equal altitudes of the &s;un, in order to di&s;cover whether the watch had altered its rate. The caulkers were &s;et to work to caulk the &s;hip; and Captain Cook had concerted mea&s;ures for &s;upplying both &s;hips with &s;uch provi&s;ions as were wanted; and, as the &s;e|veral articles for the Re&s;olution were got ready&punc; they were immediately conveyed on board.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="030274_0068_0FE56B01D2E29070">The homeward-bound French &s;hip &s;ailed for Europe on the 26th, and by her we &s;ent letters to England. The next day the Hamp&s;hire Ea&s;t-India &s;hip, from Bencoolen, anchored in the bay.</P>
<P>On the 31&s;t of October it blew exce&s;&s;ively hard at &s;outh-ea&s;t, and continued for three days. The Re&s;olution was the only &s;hip in the bay that rode out the gale without dragging her anchors.</P>
<P>The &s;torm cea&s;ed on the 3d of November, and on the 6th the Hamp&s;hire &s;ailed for England, in which Captain Cook &s;ent home an invalid. On the 10th, in the morning, the Di&s;covery arrived in the bay. She &s;ailed from Plymouth on the 1&s;t of Augu&s;t, and would have been in with us a week &s;ooner, had not the late gale of wind blown her off the coa&s;t. Captain Clerke, on his pa&s;&s;age from England, lo&s;t one of his marines, by falling over board. No other accident happened among his people, and they arrived in perfect health.</P>
<P>The next day the Di&s;covery wanting caulk|ing, Captain Cook &s;ent all his workmen on board her, and lent every other a&s;&s;i&s;tance to the Captain to expedite his &s;upply of provi&s;ions and water.</P>
<P>Having, by the Governor's permi&s;&s;ion, taken our cattle on &s;hore, on the night preceding the 14th, &s;ome dogs got in among&s;t the &s;heep, forced them out of the pen, killed four, and di&s;per&s;ed the re&s;t. We recovered &s;ix of them the next day; but among tho&s;e which were mi&s;&s;ing were two rams, and two of the fine&s;t ewes in the whole flock.
<PB N="22" REF="030274_0069_0FE56B04485B6780">
Though the Dutch frequently boa&s;t of the po|lice at the Cape, yet the Captain's &s;heep evaded all the vigilance of the Fi&s;cal's officers and peo|ple. At length, after much trouble and expence, by employing &s;ome of the lowe&s;t fellows of the place, we recovered all but the two ewes. One of the rams, however, was &s;o mi&s;erably torn by the dogs, that we thought he would never recover.</P>
<P>Mr. Hemmy, the Lieutenant-governor, very obligingly offered to make up this lo&s;s, by giv|ing Captain Cook a Spani&s;h ram, out of &s;ome he had &s;ent for from Li&s;bon; but the Captain de|clined the offer, thinking it would equally an|&s;wer his purpo&s;e to take with him &s;ome of the Cape rams: in this, however, the Captain was mi&s;taken. Mr. Hemmy had endeavoured to in|troduce European &s;heep at the Cape; but all his attempts were fru&s;trated by the ob&s;tinacy of the country people, who highly e&s;teemed their own breed, on account of their large tails; the fat of which &s;ometimes produces more money than the whole car<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a&s;s be&s;ides. Indeed the mo&s;t remark|able thing in the Cape &s;heep is the length and thickne&s;s of their tails, which weigh from ten to fifteen pounds.</P>
<P>While the &s;hips were repairing for the pro&s;e|cution of our voyage, Mr. Ander&s;on, and &s;ome of our officers, made an excur&s;ion, to take a &s;ur|vey of the neighbouring country. Mr. Ander|&s;on
<PB N="23" REF="030274_0070_0FE56B06C1B37878">
relates their proceedings to the following effect:</P>
<P>In the forenoon of Saturday the 16th of No|vember, he, and five others, &s;et out in a wag|gon, to take a view of the country. They cro&s;&s;ed the large plain to the ea&s;tward of the town, which is entirely a white &s;and, re&s;embling that which is commonly found on beaches. At five in the af|ternoon they pa&s;&s;ed a large farm-hou&s;e, &s;ome corn-fields and vineyards, &s;ituated beyond the plain, where the &s;oil appeared worth cultivating. At &s;even they arrived at Stellenbo&s;h, a colony, in point of importance, next to that of the Cape.</P>
<P>The village &s;tands at the foot of the range of lofty mountains, about twenty miles to the ea&s;t|ward of Cape-Town, and con&s;i&s;ts of about thirty hou&s;es, which are neat and clean: a rivulet, and the &s;helter of &s;ome large oaks, planted at its fir&s;t &s;ettling, form a rural pro&s;pect in this de&s;ert coun|try. There are &s;ome thriving vineyards and or|chards about the place, which &s;eem to indicate an excellent &s;oil, though perhaps much may be owing to the uncommon &s;erenity of the air.</P>
<P>At this &s;ea&s;on of the year, Mr. Ander&s;on could find but few plants in flower, and in&s;ects were very &s;carce. He and his companions left Stel|lenbo&s;h the next morning, and &s;oon arrived at the hou&s;e they had pa&s;&s;ed on Saturday; Mr. Cloeder, the owner of which, having &s;ent them an invitation to vi&s;it him, they were entertain|ed
<PB N="24" REF="030274_0071_0FE56B084A218180">
by this gentleman with great politene&s;s and ho&s;pitality. They were received with a band of mu&s;ic, which continued playing while they were at dinner; which, in that &s;ituation, might be reckoned elegant.</P>
<P>In the afternoon they cro&s;&s;ed the country, and pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome large plantations. In the evening they arrived at a farm-hou&s;e, which is &s;aid to be the fir&s;t in the cultivated tract called the <HI>Pearl.</HI> Here they had a view of Draken&s;tein, the third colony of this country, which contains &s;everal little farms or plantations.</P>
<P>Plants and in&s;ects were as &s;carce here as at Stellenbo&s;h, but there was a greater plenty of &s;hrubs, or &s;mall trees, naturally produced, than they had before &s;een in the country.</P>
<P>On Tue&s;day the 19th, in the afternoon, they went to &s;ee a remarkable large &s;tone, called by the inhabitants the Tower of Babylon, or the Pearl Diamond. It &s;tands upon the top of &s;ome low hills, and is of an oblong &s;hape, rounded on the top, and lying nearly &s;outh and north. The ea&s;t and we&s;t &s;ides are nearly perpendicular. The &s;outh end is not equally &s;teep, but its greate&s;t height is there; whence it declines gently to the north-part, by which they a&s;cended, and had a very exten&s;ive pro&s;pect of the whole country.</P>
<P>The circumference of this &s;tone is about half a mile, as they were half an hour walking round it, including allowances for &s;topping and a bad
<PB N="25" REF="030274_0072_0FE56B0FC7A84FD8">
road. Its height &s;eems to equal the dome of St. Paul's church. Except &s;ome few &s;i&s;&s;ures, it is one uninterrupted ma&s;s of &s;tone. The &s;tone is of that &s;ort which mineralogi&s;ts call <HI>Saxum Con|glutinatum.</HI></P>
<P>On the 20th, in the morning, they &s;et out from the Pearl, and going a different road, pa&s;&s;|ed through an uncultivated country to the Tyger Hills, where they beheld &s;ome tolerable corn|fields. About noon, they &s;topped in a valley for refre&s;hment, where they were plagued with a va&s;t number of mu&s;quitoes; and, in the evening, ar|rived at the Cape-Town.</P>
<P>On Saturday the 23d, we got the ob&s;ervatory, clock, &amp;c. on board. From the re&s;ult of &s;everal calculations and ob&s;ervations, we had rea&s;on to conclude, that the watch, or time-piece, had per|formed well all the way from England.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>CAPTAIN Cook, fearing a &s;econd di&s;a&s;ter, got his &s;heep and other cattle on board as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible. He al&s;o increa&s;ed his &s;tock by pur|cha&s;ing two bulls, two heifers, two &s;tone-hor&s;es, two mares, two rams, &s;ome ewes and goats, &s;ome poultry, and &s;ome rabbits.</P>
<P>Both &s;hips being &s;upplied with provi&s;ions and water &s;ufficient for two years and upwards, and every other nece&s;&s;ary article, and Captain Cook having given Captain Clerke a copy of his in&s;truc|tions, we repaired on board in the morning of the 30th. A breeze &s;prung up at &s;outh-ea&s;t, at five in the afternoon, with which we weighed and &s;tood out of the Bay; at nine it fell calm, and we anchored. At three o'clock the next morn|ing, we weighed and put to &s;ea, with a light breeze at &s;outh, but did not get clear of land till the 3d of December in the morning.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="030274_0074_0FE56B1323BCD590">On Thur&s;day the 5th, a &s;quall of wind carried away the mizen top-ma&s;t of the Re&s;olution, but we had another to replace it. On the evening of the 6th, being then in the latitude of 39&deg; 14&prime; &s;outh, and in the longitude of 23&deg; 56&prime; ea&s;t, we ob&s;erved &s;everal &s;pots of water of a reddi&s;h hue. Upon examining &s;ome of this water that was taken up, we perceived a number of &s;mall animals, which the micro&s;cope di&s;covered to re&s;emble cray|fi&s;h.</P>
<P>We continued to the &s;outh-ea&s;t, followed by a mountainous &s;ea, which occa&s;ioned the &s;hip to roll exceedingly, and rendered our cattle trouble|&s;ome. Several goats, e&s;pecially the males, died, and &s;ome &s;heep. We now began to feel the cold in a very &s;en&s;ible degree.</P>
<P>On Thur&s;day the 12th, at noon, we di&s;covered land extending from &s;outh-ea&s;t by &s;outh, to &s;outh-ea&s;t by ea&s;t. We, at length, di&s;covered it to be two i&s;lands. That which lies mo&s;t to the &s;outh, appeared to be about fifteen leagues in circuit; and the mo&s;t northerly one, about nine leagues in circuit.</P>
<P>We pa&s;&s;ed at equal di&s;tance from both i&s;lands, and could not di&s;cover either tree or &s;hrub on either of them. They &s;eemed to have a rocky &s;hore, and, excepting the &s;outh-ea&s;t parts, a ridge of barren mountains, who&s;e &s;ides and &s;ummits were covered with &s;now.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="030274_0075_0FE56B1505F93C60">The&s;e two i&s;lands, and four others more to the ea&s;t, were di&s;covered by Captains Marion du Fre&s;ne and Crozet, French navigators, in January 1772, on their pa&s;&s;age from the Cape of Good Hope to the Philippine I&s;lands. As they have no names in the French chart of the &s;outhern hemi&s;phere, Captain Cook named the two we now &s;aw Prince Edward's I&s;lands, and the other four by the name of Marion's and Crozet's I&s;lands.</P>
<P>We had now, in general, &s;trong gales, and very indifferent weather. After leaving Prince Edward's I&s;lands, we &s;haped our cour&s;e to pa&s;s to the &s;outhward of the four others, to get into the latitude of the land di&s;covered by Mon&s;ieur de Kerguelen.</P>
<P>Captain Cook had received in&s;tructons to exa|mine this i&s;land, and endeavour to di&s;cover a good harbour. On the 16th we &s;aw numbers of penguins and divers, and rock-weed floating in the &s;ea; and on the 21&s;t we &s;aw a very large &s;eal. The weather was now very &s;oggy, and as we hourly expected to fall in with the land, our navigation was both dangerous and tedious.</P>
<P>On the 24th, at &s;ix in the morning, the fog clearing away a little, we &s;aw land, bearing &s;outh &s;outh-ea&s;t, which we afterwards found to be an i&s;land of con&s;iderable height, and about three leagues in circuit. We &s;oon after di&s;covered ano|ther of equal magnitude, about one league to the
<PB N="29" REF="030274_0076_0FE56B1AE4167AC8">
ea&s;tward; and, between the&s;e two, &s;ome &s;maller ones. In the direction of &s;outh by ea&s;t, another high i&s;land was &s;een. We did but ju&s;t weather the i&s;land la&s;t mentioned: it was a high round rock, named Bligh's Cap. Captain Cook &s;up|po&s;ed this to be the &s;ame that Mon&s;ieur de Ker|guelen called the I&s;le of Rendezvous; but he knew nothing that could rendezvous at it but the fowls of the air, for it was certainly inacce&s;&s;ible to every other animal.</P>
<P>The weather beginning to clear up about ele|ven, we tacked, and &s;teered in for the land. At noon we were enable to determine the latitude of Bligh's Cap to be 48&deg; 29&prime; &s;outh, and its longitude 68&deg; 40&prime;. We pa&s;&s;ed it at three o'clock, with a fre&s;h gale at we&s;t.</P>
<P>Pre&s;ently after we clearly &s;aw the land, and at four o'clock it extended from &s;outh-ea&s;t to &s;outh-we&s;t by &s;outh, di&s;tant about four miles. The left extreme, which Captain Cook judged to be the northern point of this land, called in the French chart of the &s;outhern hemi&s;phere Cape Fran&ccedil;ois, terminated in a high perpendicular rock; and the right one in a high indented point.</P>
<P>Towards the middle of the land there appeared to be an inlet; but, on our approaching it, we &s;aw it was only a bending on the coa&s;t: we, there|fore, bore up to go round Cape Fran&ccedil;ois.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="030274_0077_0FE56B1CDEFD2E88">Having got off the Cape, we ob&s;erved the coa&s;t, to the &s;outhward, much indented by points and bays, and, therefore, fully expected to find a good harbour. We &s;oon di&s;covered one, into which we began to ply; but it pre&s;ently fell calm, and we anchored in forty-five fathom water: the Di&s;covery al&s;o anchored there &s;oon after. Mr. Bligh, the ma&s;ter, was ordered to &s;ound the har|bour; who reported it to be &s;afe and commo|dious.</P>
<P>Early in the morning of the 25th we weighed, and having wrought into the harbour, we an|chored in eight fathoms water. The Di&s;covery got in at two o'clock in the afternoon; when Captain Clerke informed us, that he had with difficulty e&s;caped being driven on the &s;outh point of the harbour, his anchor having &s;tarted before he could &s;horten in the cable. They were, there|fore, obliged to &s;et &s;ail, and drag the anchor after them, till they had room to heave it up, when they perceived that one of its palms was broken off.</P>
<P>Immediately after we had anchored, Captain Cook ordered all the boats to be hoi&s;ted out, and the empty water-ca&s;ks to be got ready. In the mean time he landed, to &s;earch for a convenient &s;pot where they might be filled, and to ob&s;erve what the place afforded.</P>
<P>He found va&s;t quantities of penguins, and other birds, and &s;eals, on the &s;hore. The latter were
<PB N="31" REF="030274_0078_0FE56B1E64BA86E0">
not numerous, but &s;o in&s;en&s;ible of fear, that we killed as many as we cho&s;e, and made u&s;e of their fat and blubber to make oil for our lamps, and other purpo&s;es. Fre&s;h water was exceedingly plentiful; but not a &s;ingle tree or &s;hrub was to be di&s;covered, and but little herbage of any kind; though we had flattered our&s;elves with the hope of meeting with &s;omething con&s;iderable growing here, having ob&s;erved the &s;ides of &s;ome of the hills to be of a lively green.</P>
<P>Before Captain Cook returned to his &s;hip, he a&s;cended a ridge of rocks, ri&s;ing one above ano|ther, expecting, by that means, to obtain a view of the country; but before he had reached the top, &s;o thick a fog came on, that it was with difficulty he could find his way down again. Towards the evening we hauled the &s;eine at the head of the harbour, but caught no more than half a dozen &s;mall fi&s;h; nor had we any better &s;ucce&s;s the next day, when we tried with hook and line. Our only re&s;ource, therefore, for fre&s;h pro|vi&s;ions, was birds, which were innumerable.</P>
<P>Though it was both foggy and rainy, on Thur&s;|day the 26th, we began to fill water, and to cut gra&s;s for our cattle, which we found near the head of the harbour. The rivulets were &s;welled to &s;uch a degree, by the rain that fell, that the &s;ides of the hills, bounding the harbour, appeared to be covered with a &s;heet of water.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="030274_0079_0FE56B1FEC6D6DA8">The people having laboured hard for two &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ive days, and nearly completed our water, Captain Cook allowed them the 27th of Decem|ber as a day of re&s;t, to celebrate Chri&s;tmas. In con&s;equence of which, many of them went on &s;hore, and made excur&s;ions into the country, which they found de&s;olate and barren in the ex|treme. In the evening one of them pre&s;ented a quart bottle to Captain Cook, which he had found on the north-&s;ide of the harbour, fa&s;tened with &s;ome wire to a projecting rock. This bottle contained a piece of parchment, with the follow|ing in&s;cription:

</ARGUMENT>
<P>ON the 29th of December we &s;ailed out of Chri&s;tmas Harbour, &s;teering &s;outh-ea&s;t along the coa&s;t, with a fine breeze and clear weather. This was unexpected, as, for &s;ome time pa&s;t, fogs had prevailed more or le&s;s every day. Though we kept the lead con&s;tantly going, we &s;eldom &s;truck ground with a line of &s;ixty fathoms.</P>
<P>We were off a promontory, which Captain Cook called Cape Cumberland, about &s;even or eight o'clock. It lies about a league and an half from the &s;outh point of Chri&s;tmas Harbour; between them is a good bay. Off Cape Cumberland is a &s;mall i&s;land on the &s;ummit of which is a rock, re&s;embling a &s;entry-box, which name was given to the i&s;land on that account. A group of &s;mall i&s;lands and rocks lies two miles farther to the ea&s;tward: we &s;ailed between the&s;e and Sentry|box
<PB N="36" REF="030274_0084_0FE56B2DD6C5ECF0">
I&s;land, the breadth of the channel being full a mile. We found no bottom with forty fathoms of line.</P>
<P>After pa&s;&s;ing through this channel, we &s;aw a bay on the &s;outh-&s;ide of Cape Cumberland, running in three leagues to the we&s;tward. It is formed by Cape Cumberland to the north, and by a promon|tory to the &s;outh. Captain Cook named this pro|montory Point Pringle, as a compliment to Sir John Pringle, Pre&s;ident of the Royal Society. The bottom of this bay was called Cumberland Bay.</P>
<P>The coa&s;t is formed into a fifth bay, to the &s;outhward of Point Pringle. In this bay, which obtained the name of White Bay, are &s;everal le&s;&s;er bays or coves, which appeared to be &s;heltered from all winds. Off the &s;outh-point, &s;everal rocks rai&s;e their heads above water, and probably there are many others that do not.</P>
<P>The land which fir&s;t opened off Cape Fran&ccedil;ois, in the direction of &s;outh 53&deg; ea&s;t, we had kept on our larboard-bow, thinking it was an i&s;land, and that we &s;hould di&s;cover a pa&s;&s;age between that and the main; but we found it to be a penin&s;ula, joined to the re&s;t of the coa&s;t by a low i&s;thmus. The bay, formed by this penin&s;ula, Captain Cook named Repul&s;e Bay. The northern point of the penin&s;ula was named Howe's Foreland, in honor of Lord Howe.</P>
<P>Drawing near it, we ob&s;erved &s;ome rocks and breakers not far from the north-we&s;t part, and two
<PB N="37" REF="030274_0085_0FE56B31F39BDE48">
i&s;lands to the ea&s;tward of it, which, at fir&s;t, ap|peared as one. We &s;teered between them and the foreland, and were in the middle of the chan|nel by twelve o'clock. The land of this fore|land or penin&s;ula, is of a tolerable height, and of a hilly and rocky &s;ub&s;tance. The coa&s;t is low, and almo&s;t covered with &s;ea-birds. We al&s;o &s;aw &s;ome &s;eals upon the beaches.</P>
<P>Having cleared the rocks and i&s;lands before|mentioned, we perceived the whole &s;ea before us to be chequered with large beds of rock-weed, which was fa&s;t to the bottom. There is often found a great depth of water upon &s;uch &s;hoals, and rocks have, as often, rai&s;ed their heads al|mo&s;t to the &s;urface of the water. It is always dangerous to &s;ail over them, e&s;pecially when there is no &s;urge of the &s;ea to di&s;cover the danger. We endeavoured to avoid the rocks, by &s;teer|ing through the winding channels by which they were &s;eparated. Though the lead was continu|ally going, we never &s;truck ground with a line of &s;ixty fathoms; this increa&s;ed the danger, as we could not anchor, however urgent the ne|ce&s;&s;ity might be. At length we di&s;covered a lurking rock, in the middle of one of the&s;e beds of weeds, and even with the &s;urface of the &s;ea. This was &s;ufficiently alarming, to make us take every precaution to avoid danger.</P>
<P>We were now about eight miles to the &s;outh|ward of Howe's Foreland, acro&s;s the mouth of a
<PB N="38" REF="030274_0086_0FE56B346D3CF2A8">
large bay. In this bay are &s;everal rocks, low i&s;lands, and beds of &s;ea-weed; but there appear|ed to be winding channels between them. We were &s;o much embarra&s;&s;ed with the&s;e &s;hoals, that we hauled off to the ea&s;tward, in hopes of extri|cating our&s;elves from our difficulties; but this plunged us into greater, and we found it ab&s;o|lutely nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ecure the &s;hips, if po&s;&s;ible, before night, e&s;pecially as the weather was hazy, and a fog was apprehended.</P>
<P>Seeing &s;ome inlets to the &s;outh-we&s;t, Captain Cook ordered Captain Clerke (the Di&s;covery drawing le&s;s water than the Re&s;olution) to lead in for the &s;hore, which was immediately attempt|ed: after running over the edges of &s;everal &s;hoals, on which was found from ten to twenty fathoms water&punc; Captain Clerke made the &s;ignal for hav|ing di&s;covered an harbour, in which we anchor|ed in fifteen &s;athoms water, about five o'clock in the evening.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner were the &s;hips &s;ecured, than it be|gan to blow &s;o very &s;trong, that we deemed it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;trike top-gallant yards. The wea|ther, however, continued fair, and it pre&s;ently became clear, the wind having di&s;per&s;ed the fog that had &s;ettled on the hills. As &s;oon, therefore, as we had anchored, Captain Cook ordered two boats to be hoi&s;ted out; in one of which he di&s;|patched Mr. Bligh, the Ma&s;ter, to &s;urvey the up|per part of the harbour, and looking out for wood.
<PB N="39" REF="030274_0087_0FE56B35F3C48870">
He al&s;o de&s;ired Captain Clerke to &s;end his Ma&s;|ter to &s;ound the channel, &s;outh of the &s;mall i&s;les, and went him&s;elf, in his other boat, accompanied by Mr. Gore and Mr. Bailey, and landed on the north point, to &s;ee what di&s;covery could be made from thence.</P>
<P>From an hill over the point, they had a view of the &s;ea-co&s;t, as far as Howe's Foreland. Se|veral &s;mall i&s;lands, rocks, and breakers, were &s;cattered along the coa&s;t, and there appeared no better channel to get out of the harbour, than that by which they had entered it.</P>
<P>While Captain Cook and Mr. Bailey were mak|ing the&s;e ob&s;ervations, Mr. Gore encompa&s;&s;ed the hill, and joined them at the place where the boat was attending for them. There was nothing to ob&s;truct their walk, except &s;ome craggy pre|cipices; the country being, if po&s;&s;ible, more bar|ren and de&s;olate than that about Chri&s;tmas Har|bour. There was neither food nor covering for cattle of any &s;ort, and, if any had been left, they mu&s;t inevitably have peri&s;hed. In the little cove, where their boat was waiting for them (which Captain Cook called Penguin Cove, from the immen&s;e numbers of tho&s;e birds appearing there) is a fine river of fre&s;h water, which we could ap|proach without difficulty. Some large &s;eals, &s;hags, and a few ducks were &s;een here; and Mr. Bailey had a glance of a very &s;mall land-bird, but it flew among the rocks, and they lo&s;t it.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="030274_0088_0FE56B37D1AE6DA0">At nine o'clock they got on board, and Mr. Bligh returned &s;oon after. He reported that he had been four miles up the harbour; that its di|rection was we&s;t &s;outh-we&s;t; that its breadth near the &s;hips did not exceed a mile; that the &s;ound|ings were from thirty-&s;even to ten fathoms; and that, having landed on both &s;hores, he found the land barren and rocky, without a tree or &s;hrub, or hardly any appearance of verdure.</P>
<P>The next morning we weighed anchor and put out to &s;ea. This harbour was named Port Pal|li&s;er, in honour of Admiral Sir Hugh Palli&s;er. In getting out to &s;ea, we, in general, &s;teered through the winding channels among the &s;hoals, though we &s;ometimes ventured to run over &s;ome of them, on which we never found le&s;s than eigh|teen fathoms water; they would not, therefore, have been di&s;covered, had it not been for the &s;ea-weed growing upon them.</P>
<P>Having got three or four leagues from the coa&s;t we found a clear &s;ea, and, about nine o'clock, di&s;covered a round hill, like a &s;ugar-loaf, bear|ing &s;outh-ea&s;t, and a &s;mall i&s;land to the north|ward of it, di&s;tant about four leagues. Captain Cook named the &s;ugar-loaf hill Mount Campbell; at noon it bore &s;outh 47&deg; we&s;t; a low point bore &s;outh-ea&s;t, at the di&s;tance of about twenty miles; and we were little more than two leagues from the &s;hore.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="030274_0089_0FE56B3EC1823718">The land here, in general, is low and level. The mountains end about five leagues from the low point, leaving a great extent of low land, on which Mount Campbell is &s;ituated. The&s;e moun|tains &s;eemed to be compo&s;ed of naked rocks, who&s;e &s;ummits were covered with &s;now; and nothing but &s;terility was to be &s;een in the vallies.</P>
<P>At noon we perceived low land, opening off the low point ju&s;t mentioned, in the direction of &s;outh &s;outh-ea&s;t. It proved to be the ea&s;tern extremity of this land, and was named Cape Digby. Between Howe's Foreland and Cape Digby, the &s;hore forms one great bay, extending &s;everal leagues to the &s;outh-we&s;t. A va&s;t quan|tity of &s;ea-weed grows over it, which &s;eemed to be &s;uch as Mr. Banks di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of <HI>fucus giganteus.</HI> Though the &s;tem of this weed is not much thicker than a man's thumb, &s;ome of it grows to the amazing length of &s;ixty fathoms.</P>
<P>At one o'clock, &s;eeing a &s;mall bending in the coa&s;t, on the north &s;ide of Cape Digby, we &s;teer|ed for it, with an intention to anchor there; but, being di&s;appointed in our views, we pu&s;hed for|ward, in order to &s;ee as much as po&s;&s;ible of the coa&s;t before night. From Cape Digby, it trends nearly &s;outh-we&s;t by &s;outh to a low point, to which Captain Cook gave the name of Point Charlotte, in honour of our amiable Queen.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="030274_0090_0FE56B40949EBB78">In the direction of &s;outh &s;outh-we&s;t, about &s;ix leagues from Cape Digby, is a pretty high pro|jecting point, called the Prince of Wales's Fore|land; and &s;ix leagues beyond that, in the &s;ame direction, is the mo&s;t &s;outherly point of the whole coa&s;t, which, in honour of his Maje&s;ty, was di&s;|tingui&s;hed by the name of Cape George.</P>
<P>Between Point Charlotte, and the Prince of Wales's Foreland, we di&s;covered a deep inlet, which was called Royal Sound; and, advancing to the &s;outh, we &s;aw another inlet into the Royal Sound, on the &s;outh-we&s;t &s;ide of the Prince of Wales's Foreland.</P>
<P>On the &s;outh-we&s;t &s;ide of the Royal Sound, all the land to Cape George con&s;i&s;ts of elevated hills, gradually ri&s;ing from the &s;ea to a con&s;iderable height; they were naked and barren, and their &s;ummits capt with &s;now. Not a ve&s;tige of a tree or &s;hrub was to be &s;een. Some of the low land about Cape Digby &s;eemed to be covered with a green turf, but a con&s;iderable part of it appeared quite naked. Penguins, and other oceanic birds, were numerous on the beaches, and &s;hags innu|merable kept flying about our &s;hips.</P>
<P>De&s;irous of getting the length of Cape George, Captain Cook continued to &s;tretch to the &s;outh, till between &s;even and eight o'clock; when, &s;ee|ing no probability of accompli&s;hing his de&s;ign, he took the advantage of the wind, which had &s;hifted to we&s;t &s;outh-we&s;t, (the direction in
<PB N="43" REF="030274_0091_0FE56B421C572850">
which we wanted to go) and &s;tood away from the coa&s;t.</P>
<P>Cape George now bore &s;outh 53&deg; we&s;t, di&s;|tant about &s;even leagues. We &s;aw no land to the &s;outh of it, except a &s;mall i&s;land that lies off the pitch of the Cape; and a &s;outh-we&s;t &s;well, which we met when we brought the Cape to bear in this direction, almo&s;t convinced us that there was no more in that quarter.</P>
<P>The French di&s;coverers imagined Cape Fran|&ccedil;ois to be the projecting point of a &s;outhern con|tinent. The Engli&s;h have di&s;covered that no &s;uch continent exi&s;ts, and that the land in que&s;|tion is an i&s;land of &s;mall extent; which, from its &s;terility, might properly be called the I&s;land of De&s;olation; but Captain Cook was unwilling to rob Mon&s;ieur de Kerguelen of the honour of its bearing his name.</P>
<P>Mr. Ander&s;on, who, during the &s;hort time we lay in Chri&s;tmas Harbour, lo&s;t no opportunity of &s;earching the country in every direction, relates the following particulars.</P>
<P>No place, (&s;ays he) hitherto di&s;covered in either hemi&s;phere, affords &s;o &s;canty a field for the na|turali&s;t as this &s;teril &s;pot. Some verdure, indeed, appeared, when at a &s;mall di&s;tance from the &s;hore, which might rai&s;e the expectation of meeting with a little herbage; but all this lively appearance was occa&s;ioned by one &s;mall plant, re&s;embling &s;axifrage, which grew up the hills in large &s;pead|ing
<PB N="44" REF="030274_0092_0FE56B440FFC9B08">
tufts, on a kind of rotten turf, which, if dried might &s;erve for fuel, and was the only thing &s;een here that could po&s;&s;ibly be applied to that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Another plant, which grew to near the height of two feet, was pretty plentifully &s;cattered about the boggy declivities; it had the appearance of a &s;mall cabbage when it was &s;hot into &s;eeds. It had the watery acrid ta&s;te of the anti&s;corbutic plants, though it materially differed from the whole tribe. When eaten raw, it was not unlike the New-Zea|land &s;curvy-gra&s;s; but when boiled, it acquired a rank flavour. At this time, none of its &s;eeds were ripe enough to be brought home, and intro|duced into our Engli&s;h kitchen-gardens.</P>
<P>Near the brooks and boggy places were found two other &s;mall plants, which were eaten as &s;allad; the one like garden cre&s;&s;es, and very hot; and the other very mild: the latter is a curio&s;ity, hav|ing not only male and female, but al&s;o androgy|nus plants.</P>
<P>Some coar&s;e gra&s;s grew pretty plentifully in a few &s;mall &s;pots near the harbour, which was cut down for our cattle. In &s;hort, the whole cata|logue of plants did not exceed eighteen, including a beautiful &s;pecies of lichen, and &s;everal &s;orts of mo&s;s. Nor was there the appearance of a tree or &s;hrub in the whole country.</P>
<P>Among the animals, the mo&s;t con&s;iderable were &s;eals, which were di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of
<PB N="45" REF="030274_0093_0FE56B4998DC7C98">
&s;ea-bears; being the &s;ort that are called the ur&s;ine &s;eal. They come on &s;hore to repo&s;e and breed. At that time they were &s;hedding their hair, and &s;o remarkably tame, that there was no difficulty in kelling them.</P>
<P>No other quadruped was &s;een; but a great number of oceanic birds, as ducks, &s;hags, petrels, &amp;c. The ducks were &s;omewhat like a widgeon, both in &s;ize and figure; a con&s;iderable number of them were killed and eaten: they were excellent food, and had not the lea&s;t fi&s;hy ta&s;te.</P>
<P>The Cape petrel, the &s;mall blue one, and the &s;mall black one, or Mother Carey's chicken, were not in plenty here; but another &s;ort, which is the large&s;t of the petrels, and called by the &s;ea|men Mother Carey's goo&s;e, is found in abun|dance. This petrel is as large as an albatro&s;s, and is carnivorous, feeding on the dead carca&s;&s;es of &s;eals, birds, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The greate&s;t number of birds here were pen|guins, which con&s;i&s;t of three &s;orts. The head of the large&s;t is black, the upper part of the body of a leaden-grey, the under part white, and the feet black; two broad &s;tripes of fine yellow de|&s;cend from the head to the brea&s;t; the bill is of a reddi&s;h colour, and longer than in the other &s;orts. The &s;econd &s;ort is about half the &s;ize of the for|mer. It is of a blacki&s;h grey on the upper part of the body, and has a white &s;pot on the upper
<PB N="46" REF="030274_0094_0FE56B4B2E8D4C20">
part of the head. The bill and feet are yellowi&s;h. In the third &s;ort, the upper part of the body and throat are black, the re&s;t white, except the top of the head, which is ornamented with a fine yellow arch, which it can erect as two cre&s;ts.</P>
<P>The &s;hags here were of two &s;orts, viz. the le&s;&s;er corvorant, or water-crow, and another with a blacki&s;h back and a white belly. The &s;ea|&s;wallow, the tern, the common &s;ea-gull, and the Port Egmont hen, were al&s;o found here.</P>
<P>Large flocks of a &s;ingular kind of white bird flew about here, having the ba&s;e of the bill co|vered with a horney cru&s;t. It had a black bill and white feet, was &s;omewhat larger than a pigeon, and the fle&s;h ta&s;ted like that of a duck.</P>
<P>The &s;eine was once hauled, when we found a few fi&s;h about the &s;ize of a &s;mall haddock. The only &s;hell-fi&s;h we &s;aw here, were a few limpets and mu&s;cles.</P>
<P>Many of the hills, notwith&s;tanding they were of a moderate height, were at that time covered with &s;now, though an&s;wering to our June. It is rea&s;onable to imagine that rain mu&s;t be very fre|quent here, as well from the marks of large tor|rents having ru&s;hed down, as from the appearance of the country, which, even on the hills, was a continued bog or &s;wamp.</P>
<P>The rocks con&s;i&s;t principally of a dark blue and very hard &s;tone, intermixed with particles of
<PB N="47" REF="030274_0095_0FE56B4CEAA4CF20">
glimmer or quartz. Some con&s;iderable rocks were al&s;o formed here from a browni&s;h brittle &s;tone.</P>

<P>CAPTAIN Cook intending, pur&s;uant to the in&s;tructions he had received, to proceed next to New-Zealand, to take in wood and water, and provide hay for the cattle, &s;teered ea&s;t by north from Kerguelen's Land.

in that quarter eight days; during which, though there was at the &s;ame time a thick fog, we ran upwards of three hundred leagues, chiefly in the dark; the &s;un, indeed, &s;ometimes made its appearance, but very rarely. On the 7th, Cap|tain Cook di&s;patched a boat with orders to Cap|tain Clerke, fixing their rendezvous at Adventure Bay, in Van Diemen's Land, if the &s;hips &s;hould happen to &s;eparate before they arrived there. However, we had the good fortune not to lo&s;e company with each other. On Sunday the 12th, the northerly winds were &s;ucceeded by a calm, which was &s;oon followed by a &s;outherly wind. Our latitude was now 48&deg; 40&prime; &s;outh, longitude 110&deg; 26&prime; ea&s;t. The wind blew from the &s;outh a whole day, and then veering to the we&s;t and north-we&s;t, brought on &s;ome fair weather.</P>
<P>On the 19th, a &s;udden &s;quall carried away the Re&s;olution's fore-top-ma&s;t, and main-top-gallant|ma&s;t, which occa&s;ioned &s;ome delay in fitting ano|ther top-ma&s;t. The former was repaired without the lo&s;s of any part of it. The wind &s;till remain|ing at the we&s;t point, we had clear weather; and on the 24th, in the morning, we di&s;covered the coa&s;t of Van Diemen's Land, bearing north &frac12; we&s;t. Several i&s;lands and elevated rocks lie di&s;per&s;ed along the coa&s;t, the mo&s;t &s;outherly of which is the Mew&s;tone. Our latitude, at noon, was 43&deg; 47&prime; &s;outh, longitude 147&deg; ea&s;t, the &s;outh-ea&s;t or &s;outh cape being near three leagues di&s;tant. Captain

Cook gave the name of the Eddy&s;tone to a rock that lies about a league to the ea&s;tward of Swilly I&s;le or Rock, on account of its &s;triking re&s;em|blance to Eddy&s;tone light-hou&s;e. The&s;e two rocks may, even in the night, be &s;een at a con|&s;iderable di&s;tance, and are the &s;ummits of a ledge of rocks under water. On the north-ea&s;t &s;ide of Storm Bay, are &s;ome creeks that &s;eem tolerably &s;heltered; and if this coa&s;t was carefully exa|mined, &s;everal good harbours would mo&s;t pro|bably be found.</P>
<P>The 26th, at noon, a breeze &s;prung up at &s;outh-ea&s;t, which gave Captain Cook an opportu|nity of executing his de&s;ign of carrying the &s;hips into Adventure Bay, where we anchored at four o'clock in the afternoon in twelve fathoms water, about three quarters of a mile from the &s;hore. The Captains Cook and Clerke then went, in &s;e|parate boats, in &s;earch of convenient &s;pots for wooding, watering, and making hay. They found plenty of wood and water, but very little gra&s;s. The next morning Captain Cook detach|ed two parties, under the conduct of Lieutenant King, to the ea&s;t &s;ide of the bay, to cut wood and gra&s;s, &s;ome marines atttending them as a guard, though none of the natives had yet ap|peared. He al&s;o &s;ent the launch to provide water for the &s;hips; and afterwards paid a vi&s;it to the parties thus employed.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="030274_0098_0FE56B5843251978">In the evening we drew the &s;eine, and caught a great quantity of fi&s;h, with which this bay abounds; and we &s;hould have procured more, if the net had not broken. Every one now came on board with the &s;upplies they had obtained; but next morning, the wind not being fair for &s;ailing, they were again &s;ent on &s;hore on the &s;ame duty; and Mr. Roberts, one of the Mates, was di&s;|patched in a boat to examine the bay. We had ob&s;erved columns of &s;moke in different parts, from the time of our approaching the coa&s;t; but we &s;aw none of the natives till the afternoon of the 28th, when eight men and a boy &s;urpri&s;ed us with a vi&s;it at our wooding-place. They ap|proached us with the greate&s;t confidence, none of them having any weapons except one, who had a &s;hort &s;tick pointed at one end. They were of a middling &s;tature, and &s;omewhat &s;lender; their hair was black and wholly, and their &s;kin was al&s;o black. They were entirely naked, with large punctures or ridges, &s;ome in curved, and others in &s;traight lines, on different parts of their bodies. Their lips were not remarkably thick, nor their no&s;es very flat: their features, on the contrary, were not unplea&s;ing, their eyes pretty good, and their teeth tolerably even and regular, though exceedingly dirty. The faces of &s;ome of them were painted with a red ointment, and mo&s;t of them &s;meared their hair and beards with the &s;ame compo&s;ition. When we offered them pre&s;ents,
<PB N="51" REF="030274_0099_0FE56B59CA1E83E0">
they received them without any apparent &s;ati&s;|faction. They either returnrd, or threw away &s;ome bread that was given them, without even ta&s;ting it: they likewi&s;e refu&s;ed &s;ome elephant fi&s;h; but when we gave them &s;ome birds, they kept them. Two pigs having been brought on &s;hore to be left in the woods, they &s;eized them by the ears, and &s;eemed inclined to carry them off, with an intention, as we &s;uppo&s;ed, of kil|ling them.</P>
<P>Captain Cook wi&s;hing to know the u&s;e of the &s;tick which one of the &s;avages held in his hand, made &s;igns to them to &s;hew him; upon which one of them took aim at a piece of wood placed as a mark, about the di&s;tance of twenty-yard; but, after &s;everal e&s;&s;ays, he was &s;till wide of the mark. Omai, to &s;hew the great &s;uperiority of our wea|pons, immediately fired his mu&s;quet at it, which unexpected noi&s;e &s;o alarmed them, that they ran into the woods with uncommon &s;peed; and one of them was &s;o terrified, that he let fall two knives and an axe which he had received from us. They then went to the place where the crew of the Di&s;|covery were watering; but the officer of that party firing a mu&s;quet in the air, they &s;led with great precipitation.</P>
<P>Immediately after they had retired, Captain Cook ordered the two pigs, one a male and the other a female, to be carried about a mile within the woods, and he him&s;elf &s;aw them left there,
<PB N="52" REF="030274_0100_0FE56B5BC419CA18">
taking care that none of the natives &s;hould ob|&s;erve what was pa&s;&s;ing. He al&s;o intended to have left a young bull and a cow, be&s;ides &s;ome goats and &s;heep; but he &s;oon relinqui&s;hed that de&s;ign, being of opinion that the natives would de&s;troy them; which he &s;uppo&s;ed would be the fate of the pigs, if they &s;hould chance to find them out. But as &s;wine &s;oon become wild, and are fond of being in the woods, it is probable that they were pre|&s;erved. The other cattle could not have remained long concealed from the &s;avages, as they mu&s;t have been put into an open place.</P>
<P>We were prevented from &s;ailing on the 29th by a dead calm, which continued the whole day. Captain Cook, therefore, &s;ent parties on &s;hore to cut wood and gra&s;s, as u&s;ual; and he accompanied the wooding party him&s;elf. Soon after our land|ing, about twenty of them joined us, one of whom was di&s;tingui&s;hed not only by his deformity, but by the drollery of his ge&s;ticulations, and the &s;eem|ing humour of his &s;peeches, which, however, we could not under&s;tand. Tho&s;e whom we now &s;aw differed in &s;ome re&s;pects, particularly in the tex|ture of the hair, from the natives of the more northerly parts of this country, whom Captain Cook met with in his fir&s;t voyage. Some of our pre&s;ent company had a &s;lip of the kangooroo &s;kin round their ancles; and others wore round their necks &s;ome &s;mall cord, made of fur. They &s;eemed not to value iron, but were apparently plea&s;ed
<PB N="53" REF="030274_0101_0FE56B615F023B80">
with the medals and beads that were given them. They did not even appear to know the u&s;e of fi&s;h-hooks, though it is more than probable, that they were acquainted with &s;ome method of catch|ing fi&s;h.</P>
<P>Their habitations were &s;mall hovels or &s;heds built of &s;ticks, and covered with the bark of trees. We had al&s;o good rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e, that they &s;ometimes took up their re&s;idence in the trunks of large trees, hollowed out by fire.</P>
<P>Captain Cook, on leaving the wooding party, went to the gra&s;s-cutters, and having &s;een the boats loaded with hay, returned on board. He had ju&s;t quitted the &s;hore, when &s;everal women and children appeared, and were introduced to Lieutenant King by the men who accompanied them. The&s;e females wore a kangooroo &s;kin fa&s;tened over their &s;houlders, the only u&s;e of which &s;eemed to be, to &s;upport their children on their backs, for it left tho&s;e parts uncovered which mode&s;ty directs us to conceal. Their bodies were black, and marked with &s;cars like tho&s;e of the men; from whom, however, they differed, in having their heads &s;haved; &s;ome of them being completely &s;horn, others only on one &s;ide, while the re&s;t of them had the upper part of their heads &s;haved, leaving a very narrow circle of hair all round. They were far from being hand&s;ome; however, &s;ome of our gentlemen paid their ad|dre&s;&s;es
<PB N="54" REF="030274_0102_0FE56B62E6BD1D40">
to them, and made liberal offers, but without effect.</P>
<P>In the afternoon Captain Cook went again on &s;hore, and found the gra&s;s-cutters on Penguin I&s;land, where they had met with excellent gra&s;s in the greate&s;t abundance. The different parties laboured hard till the evening, and then, having provided a &s;ufficient quantity of what was mo&s;t wanted, returned on board.</P>
<P>During our continuance in Van Diemen's Land, we had either light airs from the ea&s;t, or calms: we therefore lo&s;t little or no time by touching on this coa&s;t. This land was di&s;covered in Novem|ber 1642, by Ta&s;man, who gave it the name of Van Diemen's Land. Captain Furneaux touched at it in March 1773. It is the &s;outhern point of New-Holland, which is by far the large&s;t i&s;land in the known world, and almo&s;t de&s;erves the name of a continent. The land is diver&s;ified with hills and vallies, and well wooded. The only wind to which Adventure Bay is expo&s;ed, is the north-ea&s;t; and, upon the whole, this may be con&s;idered as a very &s;afe road. Its latitude is 43&deg; 21&prime; 20&Prime; &s;outh, and its longitude 147&deg; 29&prime; ea&s;t.</P>
<P>Mr. Ander&s;on, &s;urgeon of the Re&s;olution, em|ployed him&s;elf in examining the country during our continuance in Adventure Bay. His remarks on the inhabitants and their language, and his account of the natural productions of the coun|try, are to the following purport. There is a
<PB N="55" REF="030274_0103_0FE56B646E592878">
beautiful &s;andy beach, about two miles long, at the bottom of Adventure Bay, formed to all ap|pearance by the particles which the &s;ea wa&s;hes from a fine white &s;and-&s;tone. This beach is very well adapted for hauling a &s;eine. Behind it is a plain, with a bracki&s;h lake, out of which we caught, by angling, &s;ome bream and trout. The parts adjoining the bay are mo&s;tly hilly, and are an entire fore&s;t of tall trees, rendered almo&s;t im|pa&s;&s;able by brakes of fern, &s;hrubs, &amp;c. The &s;oil on the flat land, and on the lower part of the hills, is &s;andy, or con&s;i&s;ts of a yellowi&s;h earth, and in &s;ome parts of a reddi&s;h clay; but further up the hills, it is of a grey tough ca&s;t. This country, upon the whole, bears many marks of being very dry, and the heat appears to be great. No mineral bodies, nor &s;tones of any other kind than the white &s;and &s;tone, were ob&s;erved by us; nor could we find any vegetables that afforded &s;ub&s;i&s;tence for man. The fore&s;t-trees are all of one kind, and generally quite &s;traight: they bear clu&s;ters of &s;mall white flowers. The principal plants we ob&s;erved were wood-&s;orrel, milk-wort, cudweed, bell-flower, gladiolus, &s;amphire, and &s;everal kinds of fern. The only quadruped we &s;aw di&s;tinctly was a &s;pecies of opo&s;&s;um, about twice the &s;ize of a large rat. The kangooroo, found further northward in New Holland, may al&s;o be &s;uppo&s;ed to inhabit here, as &s;ome of the inhabitants had pieces of the &s;kin of that animal.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="030274_0104_0FE56B66419E9CA0">The principal &s;orts of birds in the woods are brown hawks or eagles, crows, large pigeons, yel|lowi&s;h paroquets, and a &s;pecies which we called <HI>motacilla cyanea,</HI> from the beautiful azure colour of its head and neck. On the &s;hore were &s;everal gulls, black oy&s;ter-catchers, or &s;ea-pies, and plo|vers of a &s;tone-colour.</P>
<P>We ob&s;erved in the woods &s;ome blacki&s;h &s;nakes that were pretty large, and we killed a lizard which was fifteen inches long and &s;ix round, beau|tifully clouded with yellow and black.</P>
<P>Among a variety of fi&s;h we caught &s;ome large rays, nur&s;es, leather-jackets, bream, &s;oles, floun|ders, gurnards, and elephant-fi&s;h; be&s;ides a &s;ort which we did not recollect to have &s;een before, and which partakes of the nature both of a round and a flat fi&s;h. Upon the rocks are mu&s;cles and other &s;hell-fi&s;h; and upon the beach we found &s;ome pretty Medu&s;a's heads. The mo&s;t trouble|&s;ome in&s;ects we met with were the mu&s;quitoes, and a large black ant, who&s;e bite inflicts extreme pain.</P>
<P>The inhabitants &s;eemed mild and chearful, with little of that wild appearance that &s;avages in general have. They are almo&s;t totally devoid of per&s;onal activity or genius, and are nearly upon a par with the wretched natives of Terra del Fuego. They di&s;play, however, &s;ome contriv|ance in their method of cutting their arms and bodies in lines of different directions, rai&s;ed above
<PB N="57" REF="030274_0105_0FE56B6A33E09038">
the &s;urface of the &s;kin. Their indifference for our pre&s;ents, their general inattention, and want of curio&s;ity, were very remarkable, and te&s;tified no acutene&s;s of under&s;tanding. Their com|plexion is a dull black, which they &s;ometimes heighten by &s;mutting their bodies, as we &s;up|po&s;ed, from their leaving a mark behind on any clean &s;ub&s;tance. Their hair is perfectly woolly and is clotted with grea&s;e and red ochre, like that of the Hottentots. Their no&s;es are broad and full, and the lower part of the face projects con|&s;iderably. Their eyes are of a moderate &s;ize, and though they are not very quick or piercing, they give the countenance a frank, chearful, and plea&s;ing ca&s;t. Their teeth are not very white, nor well &s;et, and their mouths are too wide: they wear their beards long, and clotted with paint. They are, upon the whole, well proportioned, though their belly is rather protuberant. Their favourite attitude is to &s;tand with one &s;ide for|ward, and one hand gra&s;ping, acro&s;s the back, the oppo&s;ite arm, which, on this occa&s;ion, hangs, down by the &s;ide that projects.</P>
<P>Near the &s;hore in the bay, we ob&s;erved &s;ome wretched con&s;tructions of &s;ticks covered with bark; but the&s;e &s;eemed to have been only tem|porary, and they had converted many of their large&s;t trees into more comfortable and commo|dious habitations. The trunks of the&s;e were hol|lowed out to the height of &s;ix or &s;even feet, by

</ARGUMENT>
<P>ON the 30th of January, in the morning, we weighed anchor with a light we&s;terly breeze, from Adventure Bay. Soon after we had put to &s;ea, the wind became &s;outherly, and produced a perfect &s;torm; but veering in the evening to the ea&s;t and north-ea&s;t, its fury began to abate. This wind was attended with an almo&s;t-intoler|able heat, which, however, was of &s;o &s;hort a con|tinuance, that &s;ome of our company did not per|ceive it.</P>
<P>In the night, between the 6th and 7th of Fe|bruary, one of the Di&s;covery's marines fell over|board and was drowned. On the 10th, in the afternoon, we de&s;cried the coa&s;t of New-Zealand, at the di&s;tance of eight or nine leagues. We then &s;teered for Cape Farewell, and afterwards for Stephens's I&s;land; and, in the morning of the
<PB N="61" REF="030274_0110_0FE56B761A6E3C40">
12th, anchored in Ship Cove, Queen Charlotte's Sound. We &s;oon after landed many empty water|ca&s;ks, and cleared a place for two ob&s;ervatories. In the mean time &s;everal canoes came along-&s;ide of our &s;hips; but very few of tho&s;e who were in them would venture on board. This &s;hyne&s;s ap|peared the more extraordinary, as Captain Cook was well known to all of them; and as one man in particular among the pre&s;ent group, had been treated by him with di&s;tingui&s;hed kindne&s;s dur|ing a former voyage. This man, however, could not by any means be prevailed on to come aboard. We could only account for this re&s;erve by &s;uppo&s;ing, that they were apprehen&s;ive of our revenging the death of Captain Furneaux's peo|ple who had been killed here. But, upon Cap|tain Cook's a&s;&s;uring them of the continuance of his friend&s;hip, and that he &s;hould not mole&s;t them on that account, they &s;oon laid a&s;ide all ap|pearance of &s;u&s;picion and di&s;tru&s;t. The next day we pitched two tents, and erected the ob&s;er|vatories, in which Me&s;&s;rs. King and Baily im|mediately commenced their a&s;tronomical opera|tions. Two of our men were employed in brew|ing &s;pruce beer; while others filled the water|ca&s;ks, collected gra&s;s for the cattle, and cut wood. Tho&s;e who remained on board were occupied in repairing the rigging, and performing the nece&s;|&s;ary duty of the &s;hips. A guard of marines was appointed for the protection of the different par|ties
<PB N="62" REF="030274_0111_0FE56B77A3F0E998">
on &s;hore, and arms were given to all the workmen, to repel all attacks from the natives, if they had been inclined to mole&s;t us; but this did not appear to be the ca&s;e.</P>
<P>During the cour&s;e of this day, many families came from various parts of the coa&s;t, and erected their huts clo&s;e to our encampment. The faci|lity with which they build the&s;e temporary habi|tations, is remarkable. They have been &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">en to erect above twenty of them on a &s;pot of ground, which was covered with plants and &s;hrubs not an hour before. Captain Cook was pre&s;ent when a number of &s;avages landed, and built a village of this kind. They had no &s;ooner leaped from the canoes, than they tore up the &s;hrubs and plants from the ground they had fixed upon, or put up &s;ome part of the framing of a hut. While the men were thus employed, the women took care of the canoes, &s;ecured the provi&s;ions and uten&s;ils, and gathered dry &s;ticks, to &s;erve as materials for a fire. The&s;e huts are &s;ufficiently calculated for affording &s;helter from the rain and wind. The &s;ame tribe or family, however large, generally a&s;&s;ociate and build together; &s;o that their towns and villages are u&s;ually divided by pali&s;ades into &s;eparate di&s;tricts.</P>
<P>We received con&s;iderable advantage from the natives coming to live with us; for, every day, &s;ome of them were occupied in catching fi&s;h, a good &s;hare of which we generally procured by

exchanges. Be&s;ides fi&s;h, we had other refre&s;h|ments in abundance. Scurvy-gra&s;s, celery, and portable &s;oup, were boiled every day with the wheat and pea&s;e; and we had &s;pruce beer for our drink. Such a regimen &s;oon removed all &s;eeds of the &s;curvy from our people, if any of them had contracted it. But indeed, on our arrival here, we had only two invalids in both &s;hips.</P>
<P>We were occa&s;ionally vi&s;ited by other natives, be&s;ides tho&s;e who lived clo&s;e to us. Their arti|cles of traffic were fi&s;h, curio&s;ities, and women; the two fir&s;t of which were &s;peedily di&s;po&s;ed of, but the latter did not come to a good market, as our crew had conceived a di&s;like to them. Cap|tain Cook ob&s;erves upon this occa&s;ion, that he connived at a connection with women, becau&s;e he could not prevent it; but that he never en|couraged it, becau&s;e he dreaded its con&s;equences. Among our occa&s;ional vi&s;itors was a chief called Kahoora, who headed the party that cut off Cap|tain Furneaux's people. He was far from being beloved by his countrymen, &s;ome of whom even importuned Captain Cook to kill him, at the &s;ame time expre&s;&s;ing their di&s;approbation of him in the &s;evere&s;t terms. A &s;triking proof of the divi&s;ions that prevail among the&s;e people occur|red to us; for the inhabitants of each village, by turns, &s;olicited our Commodore to de&s;troy the other.</P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="030274_0113_0FE56B806C1A5FF0">Captain Cook, on the 15th, went in a boat to &s;earch for gra&s;s, and vi&s;ited the hippah, or forti|fied village, at the &s;outh-we&s;t point of the i&s;land of Motuara. He ob&s;erved no inhabitants at this village, though there were evident marks of its having been lately occupied, the hou&s;es and pali|&s;ades being in a &s;tate of good repair. Not the &s;malle&s;t ve&s;tage remained of the Engli&s;h garden|&s;eeds which had been planted at this hippah in 1773, during Captain Cook's &s;econd voyage. They had probably been all rooted out to make room for buildings; for, at the other gardens then planted, we found radi&s;hes, onions, leeks, cabbages, pur&s;lain, potatoes, &amp;c. Though the natives of New-Zealand are fond of the la&s;t|mentioned root, they had not planted a &s;ingle one, much le&s;s any of the other articles we had introduced among them.</P>
<P>Early in the morning of the 16th, the Captains Cook and Clerke, and &s;everal of the officers and &s;ailors, accompanied by Omai and two New-Zealanders, &s;et out, in five boats, to collect fod|der for the cattle. Having proceeded about three leagues up the Sound, they landed on the ea&s;t &s;ide, where they cut a &s;ufficient quantity of gra&s;s to load the two launches. On their return down the Sound, they paid a vi&s;it to Gra&s;s Cove, the place where Captain Furneaux's people had been ma&s;&s;acred. They here met with Captain Cook's old friend Pedro, who is mentioned by him in
<PB N="65" REF="030274_0114_0FE56B82392F8AA8">
the hi&s;tory of his &s;econd voyage. He, and ano|ther New-Zealander, received them on the beach, armed with the &s;pear and patoo, though not without manife&s;t &s;igns of fear. Their appre|hen&s;ions, however, were quickly di&s;&s;ipated by a few pre&s;ents, which brought down to the &s;hore two or three others of the family.</P>
<P>During the continuance of our party at this place, the Commodore, being de&s;irous of en|quiring into the particular circum&s;tances relative to the ma&s;&s;acre of our countrymen, fixed upon Omai as an interpreter for that purpo&s;e, as his language was a dialect of that of New-Zealand. Pedro, and the other natives who were pre&s;ent, none of whom had been concerned in that unfor|tunate tran&s;action, an&s;wered every que&s;tion with|out re&s;erve. Their information imported, that while our people were at dinner, &s;ome of the na|tives &s;tole, or &s;natched from them, &s;ome fi&s;h and bread, for which offence they received &s;ome blows; a quarrel immediately en&s;ued, and two of the &s;avages were &s;hot dead, by the only two mu&s;quets that were firred; for, before a third was di&s;charged, the natives ru&s;hed furiou&s;ly upon our people, and being &s;uperior in number, de&s;troyed them all. Pedro and his companions al&s;o pointed out the very &s;pot where the <HI>fracas</HI> happened, and the place where the boat lay, in which a black &s;ervant of Captain Furneaux had been left to take care of it.</P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="030274_0115_0FE56B83C6D26620">According to another account, this negro was the occa&s;ion of the quarrel; for, one of the na|tives &s;tealing &s;omething out of the boat, the black gave him a violent blow with a &s;tick. His coun|trymen hearing his cries at &s;ome di&s;tance ima|gined he was killed, and immediately attacked our people, who, before they could reach the boat, or prepare them&s;elves again&s;t the unex|pected a&s;&s;ault, fell a &s;acrifice to the fury of the exa&s;perated &s;avages.</P>
<P>The former of the&s;e accounts was corroborated by the te&s;timony of many other natives, who could have no intere&s;t in di&s;gui&s;ing the truth. The latter account <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;ts upon the authority of the young New-Zealander, who quitted his country for the &s;ake of going away with us, and who, therefore, could not be &s;uppo&s;ed to be inclined to deceive us. As they all agreed, that the fray happened while the boat's crew were at dinner, both the accounts may be true; for it is by no means improbable, that, while &s;ome of the i&s;land|ers were &s;tealing from the man who had been left to guard the boats, others might take equal liber|ties with tho&s;e who were on &s;hore.</P>
<P>It appears, that there was no premeditated plan of blood&s;hed, and that, if the&s;e thefts had not been rather too ha&s;tily re&s;ented, all mi&s;chief would have been avoided; for Kahoora's greate&s;t enemies acknowledged, that he had no previous intention of quarrelling. With regard to the
<PB N="67" REF="030274_0116_0FE56B859ADDB368">
boat, &s;ome &s;aid, that it had been pulled to pieces and burnt; while others a&s;&s;erted, that it had been carried off by a party of &s;trangers.</P>
<P>Our party continued at Gra&s;s Cove till the evening, and then embarked to return to the &s;hips. They had &s;carcely left the &s;hore, when the wind began to blow violently at north-we&s;t, &s;o that it was not without great difficulty that they could reach the &s;hips, where &s;ome of the boats did not arrive till the next morning; and it was very fortunate that they got on board then, for &s;oon afterwards a perfect &s;torm aro&s;e. To|wards the evening, however, the wind veering to the ea&s;t, brought on fair weather. On Tue&s;day the 18th, Pedro and his whole family came to re&s;ide near us. The proper name of this chief was Matahouah; but &s;ome of Captain Cook's people had given him the appellation of Pedro in a former voyage. On the 20th we had another &s;torm, of le&s;s duration than the former, but more violent; in con&s;equence of which, both our &s;hips &s;truck their yards and top-ma&s;ts. The&s;e tempe&s;ts are frequent here; and the nearer the &s;hore, the more &s;en&s;ible are their effects.</P>
<P>On Friday the 21&s;t, a tribe or family of about thirty per&s;ons came from the upper part of the &s;ound to vi&s;it us. Their chief was named To|matongeauooranuc: he was about the age of forty-five, and had a frank, chearful countenance; and, indeed, the re&s;t of his tribe were, upon the
<PB N="68" REF="030274_0117_0FE56B8AD0A5C3B8">
whole, the hand&s;ome&s;t of all the New-Zealanders that Captain Cook had ever &s;een. By this time upwards of two-thirds of the natives of Queen Charlotte's Sound had &s;ettled near us, numbers of whom daily re&s;orted to the &s;hips, and our en|campment on &s;hore; but the latter was mo&s;t fre|quented, during the time when our people there were making &s;eal blubber; for the &s;avages were &s;o fond of train oil, that they reli&s;hed the very dreg of the ca&s;ks, and &s;kimmings of the kettle, and con&s;idered the pure &s;tinking oil as a mo&s;t delightful fea&s;t.</P>
<P>When we had procured a competent &s;upply of hay, wood, and water, we &s;truck our tents, and the next morning, which was the 24th, weighed out of the Cove. But the wind not being &s;o fair as we could have wi&s;hed, we were obliged to ca&s;t anchor again near the I&s;le of Motuara. While we were getting under &s;ail, Tomatongeau<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oranuc, Matahouah, and many others of the natives, came to take leave of us. The&s;e two chiefs hav|ing reque&s;ted Captain Cook to pre&s;ent them with &s;ome hogs and goats, he gave to Tomatongeau|ooranuc two pigs, a boar and a &s;ow; and to Matahouah two goats, a male and female, after they had promi&s;ed not to de&s;troy them. As for the animals, which Captain Furneaux had left <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ere, Captain Cook was now told, that they were all dead; but he was afterwards informed, by the two New-Zealand youths who went away with
<PB N="69" REF="030274_0118_0FE56B8C5953E6E8">
us, that Tiratou a popular chief, had in his po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion many cocks and hens, be&s;ides a &s;ow.</P>
<P>Before we had been long at anchor near Mo|tuara, &s;everal canoes, filled with natives, came towards us, and we carried on a bri&s;k trade with them for the curio&s;ities of this place. In one of the&s;e canoes was Kahoora, whom Omai imme|diately pointed out to Captain Cook, and &s;oli|cited him to &s;hoot that chief; he al&s;o threatened to be him&s;elf his executioner, if he &s;hould ever pre&s;ume to pay us another vi&s;it. The&s;e menaces of Omai had &s;o little influence upon Kahoora, that he returned to us the next morning, accom|panied with his whole family. Omai, having obtained Captain Cook's permi&s;&s;ion to a&s;k him to come on board, introduced him into the cabin, &s;aying, "There is Kahoora; di&s;patch him." But, fearing perhaps that he &s;hould be called upon to put his former threats in execution, he in&s;tantly retired. He &s;oon, however, returned; and per|ceiving that the chief was unhurt, he earne&s;tly remon&s;trated to Captain Cook on the &s;ubject, &s;aying, that if a man killed another in England, he was hanged for it; but that Kahoora had killed ten, and therefore ju&s;tly de&s;erved death. The&s;e arguments, however plau&s;ible, had no weight with our Commodore, who de&s;ired Omai to a&s;k the New-Zealand chief, why he had de&s;troyed Captain Furneaux's people? Kahoora, confound|ed at this que&s;tion, hung down his head, folded
<PB N="70" REF="030274_0119_0FE56B8DE1D03C18">
his arms, and &s;eemed in expectation of imme|diate death: but, as &s;oon as he was a&s;&s;ured of &s;afety, he became chearful. He appeared, how|ever, unwilling to an&s;wer the que&s;tion which had been put to him, till after repeated promi&s;es that no violence &s;hould be offered him. He then ventured to inform us, that one of the natives having brought a &s;tone hatchet for the purpo&s;e of traffic, the per&s;on to whom it was offered took it, and refu&s;ed either to return it, or give any thing in exchange; upon which the owner of it &s;eized &s;ome bread by way of equivalent; and this gave ri&s;e to the quarrel that en&s;ued. He al&s;o mentioned, that he him&s;elf, during the di&s;|turbance, had a narrow e&s;cape; for a mu&s;quet was levelled at him, which he found means to avoid by &s;kulking behind the boat; and another man, who happened to &s;tand clo&s;e to him, was &s;hot dead: upon which Kahoora attacked Mr. Rowe, the officer who commanded the party, who defended him&s;elf with his hanger, with which he gave the chief a wound in the arm, till he was overpowered by &s;uperiority of numbers. Mr. Burney, whom Captain Furneaux di&s;patched the next day with an armed party in &s;earch of his people who were mi&s;&s;ing, had, upon di&s;covering the melancholy proofs of this cata&s;trophe, fired &s;everal vollies among the natives who were &s;till on the &s;pot, and were probably partaking of the horrid banquet of human fle&s;h. It was rea&s;on|able
<PB N="71" REF="030274_0120_0FE56B8F950D1190">
to &s;uppo&s;e that this firing was not ineffec|tual; but upon inquiry it appeared, that not a &s;ingle per&s;on had been killed, or even hurt, by the &s;hot which Mr. Burney's people had di&s;charged.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t of the natives we had met with, expected that Captain Cook would take vengeance on Ka|hoora for his concern in the ma&s;&s;acre; and many of them not only wi&s;hed it, but te&s;tified their &s;urpri&s;e at the Captain's forbearance and mode|ration. As the chief mu&s;t have known this, it was a matter of a&s;toni&s;hment that he &s;o often put him&s;elf in the power of our Commodore. His two la&s;t vi&s;its, in particular, were made un|der &s;uch circum&s;tances, that he could not have flattered him&s;elf with a pro&s;pect of e&s;caping, had the Captain been inclined to detain him: and yet, when his fir&s;t fears, on being que&s;tioned, had &s;ub&s;ided, &s;o far was he from entertaining unea&s;y &s;en&s;ations, that, on &s;eeing in the cabin a portrait of a New-Zealander, he de&s;ired that his own like|ne&s;s might be taken, and &s;at till Mr. Webber had fini&s;hed his portrait, without the &s;malle&s;t token of impatience. Captain Cook admired his cou|rage, and was plea&s;ed with the confidence which he repo&s;ed in him; for he placed his whole &s;afety in the uniform declarations of the Captain, that he had always been a friend to the natives, and would continue in the &s;ame &s;entiments till they gave him rea&s;on to behave otherwi&s;e; that he &s;hould think no more of their barbarous treat|ment
<PB N="72" REF="030274_0121_0FE56B956B278410">
of our countrymen, as that tran&s;action had happened long ago; but that, if they &s;hould ever venture to make a &s;econd attempt of that kind, they might re&s;t a&s;&s;ured of meeting with an adequate puni&s;hment.</P>
<P>Before our arrival in New-Zealand, Omai had expre&s;&s;ed a de&s;ire of taking one of the natives with him to his own country. He &s;oon had an opportunity of gratifying his inclination, for a youth named Taweiharooa, the only &s;on of a decea&s;ed chief, offered to accompany him, and took up his re&s;idence on board. Captain Cook cau&s;ed it to be made known to him and all his friends, that if the youth departed with us, he would never return. This declaration, however, had no effect. The day before we quitted the Cove, Tiratouton, his mother, came to receive her la&s;t pre&s;ent from Omai; and the &s;ame even|ing &s;he and her &s;on parted, with all the marks of the tendere&s;t affection. But &s;he &s;aid &s;he would weep no more, and faithfully kept her word; for the next morning, when &s;he returned to take her la&s;t farewell of Taweiharooa, &s;he was quite chear|ful all the time &s;he remained on board, and de|parted with great unconcern. A boy of about ten years of age accompanied Taweiharooa as a &s;ervant; his name was Kokoa. He was pre&s;ent|ed to Captain Cook by his own father, who part|ed with him with &s;uch indifference, as to &s;trip him, and leave him entirely naked. The Cap|tain
<PB N="73" REF="030274_0122_0FE56B96F4FECD90">
having in vain endeavoured to convince the&s;e people of the great improbability of the&s;e youths ever returning home, at length con&s;ented to their going.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of New-Zealand &s;eem to live under continual apprehen&s;ions of being de&s;troyed by each other; mo&s;t of their tribes having, as they think, &s;u&s;tained injuries from &s;ome other tribe, which they are ever eager to revenge: and it is not improbable, that the de&s;ire of a good meal is frequently a great incitement. They ge|nerally &s;teal upon the adver&s;e party in the night, and if they chance to find them unguarded, which is &s;eldom the ca&s;e, they kill every one without di&s;tinction, without &s;paring even the wo|men and children: when they have completed the inhuman ma&s;&s;acre, they either gorge them|&s;elves on the &s;pot, or carry off as many dead bo|dies as they can, and fea&s;t on them at home, with the mo&s;t horrid acts of brutality. If they are di&s;covered before they have time to execute their &s;anguinary purpo&s;e, they u&s;ually &s;teal off again, and &s;ometimes they are pur&s;ued and attacked by the adver&s;e party, in their turn. They never give quarter, or take pri&s;oners, &s;o that the van|qui&s;hed mu&s;t tru&s;t to flight alone for &s;afety. From this &s;tate of perpetual ho&s;tility, and this de&s;tructive mode of carrying it on, a New-Zea|lander derives &s;uch habitual vigilance and cir|cum&s;pection, that he is &s;carce ever off his guard:
<PB N="74" REF="030274_0123_0FE56B988186DE80">
and, indeed, the&s;e people have the mo&s;t power|ful motives to be vigilant, as the pre&s;ervation of both &s;oul and body depends on it; for it is a part of their creed, that the &s;oul of the man who&s;e fle&s;h is devoured by his enemies, is condemned to an ince&s;&s;ant fire; while the &s;oul of him who&s;e body has been re&s;cued from tho&s;e that &s;lew him, as well as the &s;ouls of tho&s;e who die a natural death, a&s;cend to the man&s;ions of the gods. Cap|tain Cook having a&s;ked them, whether they eat the fle&s;h of &s;uch friends as had lo&s;t their lives in war, but who&s;e bodies had been prevented from falling into the enemy's hands, they an&s;wered in the negative, and expre&s;&s;ed their abhorrence of the idea.</P>
<P>Their ordinary method of di&s;po&s;ing of their dead is to commit their bodies to the earth; but when they have more of their &s;lain enemies than they can conveniently eat, they throw them into the &s;ea. There are no <HI>morais,</HI> or other places of public wor&s;hip, among them; but they have prie&s;ts, who pray to the gods for the &s;ucce&s;s of their temporal affairs. The principles of their religion, of which we know but little, are &s;trong|ly in&s;tilled into them from their infancy. We ob&s;erved a remarkable in&s;tance of this in a youth, who ab&s;tained from eating during the greate&s;t part of the day, merely on account of his hair be|ing cut, though every method was practi&s;ed that could induce him to change his re&s;olution. He
<PB N="75" REF="030274_0124_0FE56B9A52D2DCE8">
&s;aid that the <HI>eatooa,</HI> or deity, would kill him if he eat any thing on that day. Towards the even|ing, however, his religious &s;cruples gave way to the importunate cravings of appetite, and he eat, though &s;paringly.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the divided &s;tate in which the&s;e people live, travelling &s;trangers, who&s;e de|&s;igns are honourable, are well received and enter|tained; but it is expected that they will remain no longer than their bu&s;ine&s;s requires. It is thus that a trade for green talc, which they call <HI>poe|nammoo,</HI> is carried on. They informed us, that none of this &s;tone is to be found, except at a place which bears its name, near the head of Queen Charlotte's Sound. We were told many fabulous and improbable &s;tories concerning this &s;tone, one of which is, that it is originally a fi&s;h, which they &s;trike with a gig in the water, and having tied a rope to it, drag it to the &s;hore, to which they fa&s;ten it, and it afterwards hardens into a &s;tone. As it is fi&s;hed out of a large lake, it is probable that it may be brought from the moun|tains, and depo&s;ited in the water, by means of the torrents. This lake is called by the inhabi|tants <HI>Tavai Poenammoo,</HI> or the water of green talc.</P>
<P>The New-Zealanders have adopted polygamy among them; and it is common for one man to have two or three wives. The women are ripe for marriage at an early age; and tho&s;e who are
<PB N="76" REF="030274_0125_0FE56B9EABCC3050">
unmarried, find difficulty in procuring &s;ub&s;i&s;t|ence.</P>
<P>The&s;e people &s;eem perfectly contented with the &s;mall degree of knowledge they po&s;&s;e&s;s, for they make no attempts to improve it. They are not remarkably curious, nor do new objects &s;trike them with much &s;urpri&s;e, for they &s;carce fix their attention for a moment. Omai, indeed, being a great favourite with them, would &s;ometimes at|tract a circle about him; but they li&s;tened to his &s;peeches with very little eagerne&s;s.</P>
<P>On our inquiring of Taweiharooa, how many &s;hips, re&s;embling ours, had ever arrived in Queen Charlotte's Sound, or in its neighbourhood, he gave us an account of one entirely unknown to us. This ve&s;&s;el, he &s;aid, had put into a harbour on the north-we&s;t coa&s;t of Teerawitte, a few years before Captain Cook arrived in the Sound in the Endeavour. He further informed us, that the Captain of her, during his continuance here, had cohabited with a female of the country, who had borne him a &s;on that was &s;till living. He al&s;o mentioned, that this &s;hip fir&s;t introduced the ve|nereal di&s;ea&s;e among the natives of New-Zealand. This dreadful di&s;order is now but too common among them. The only method they put in practice as a remedy, is to give the patient the u&s;e of a kind of hot bath, produced by the &s;team of certain green plants placed over hot &s;tones.</P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="030274_0126_0FE56BA0E11BC8C8">Taweiharooa's intelligence induced us to be|lieve, that a &s;hip had really been at Teerawitte previous to Captain Cook's arrival in the En|deavour, as it corre&s;ponded with what the Cap|tain had formerly heard; for, towards the latter end of 1773, &s;ome of the natives informed him of a &s;hip's having put into a port on the coa&s;t of Teerawitte.</P>
<P>We had another piece of information from Taweiharooa, importing that their are here &s;nakes and lizard of an enormous &s;ize. The latter were de&s;cribed by him as being eight feet long, and equal to a man's body in circumference. He &s;aid that they burrow in the ground; that they &s;ometimes &s;eize and devour men, and are killed by making fires at the mouths of their holes. We could not mi&s;under&s;tand him with re&s;pect to the animal; for, in order to &s;hew us what he meant, he drew, with his own hand, very good repre&s;entations of a lizard and &s;nake on a piece of paper.</P>
<P>Though much has been &s;aid concerning this country and its inhabitants, in the accounts of Captain Cook's two former voyages, yet the re|marks of Mr. Ander&s;on, being the re&s;ult of ac|curate ob&s;ervation, mu&s;t not be con&s;idered as al|together &s;uperfluous.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>ABOUT Queen Charlotte's Sound the land is uncommonly mountainous, ri&s;ing immediately from the &s;ea into large hills. At remote di&s;tances are vallies, terminating each towards the &s;ea in a &s;mall cove, with a pebbly or &s;andy beach; be|hind which are flat places, where the natives u&s;u|ally built their huts. This &s;ituation is the more convenient, as a brook of fine water runs through every cove, and empties it&s;elf into the &s;ea.</P>
<P>The ba&s;es of the&s;e mountains, towards the &s;hore, are con&s;tituted of a brittle yellowi&s;h &s;and-&s;tone, which acquires a bluei&s;h ca&s;t where it is laved by the &s;ea. At &s;ome places it runs in horizontal, and, at others, in oblique &s;trata. The mould or &s;oil by which it is covered re&s;embles marle, and is, in general, a foot or two in thickne&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="030274_0128_0FE56BA46440C6E8">The luxuriant growth of the productions here, &s;ufficiently indicates the quality of the &s;oil. The hills, except a few towards the &s;ea, are one con|tinued fore&s;t of lofty trees, flouri&s;hing with &s;uch uncommon vigour, as to afford an augu&s;t pro&s;pect to the admirers of the &s;ublime and beautiful works of nature.</P>
<P>This extraordinary &s;trength in vegetation is, doubtle&s;s, greatly a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the agreeable tem|perature of the climate; for, at this time, though an&s;wering to our month of Augu&s;t, the weather was not &s;o warm as to be di&s;agreeable; nor did it rai&s;e the thermometer, higher than 66&deg;. The win|ter al&s;o &s;eems equally mild with re&s;pect to cold; for in the month which corre&s;ponds to our De|cember, the mercury was never lower than 48&deg;, the trees at the &s;ame time retaining their verdure, as if in the height of &s;ummer. It is &s;uppo&s;ed their foliage remains, till pu&s;hed off in &s;pring by the &s;ucceeding leaves.</P>
<P>Though the weather is generally good, it is &s;ometimes windy, with heavy rain; which, how|ever, is never exce&s;&s;ive, and does not la&s;t above a day. In &s;hort, this would be one of the fine&s;t countries upon earth, were it not &s;o extremely hilly; which, &s;uppo&s;ing the woods to be cleared away, would leave it le&s;s proper for pa&s;turage than flat land, and infinitely le&s;s &s;o for cultiva|tion, which could never be effected here by the plough.</P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="030274_0129_0FE56BAA6CD3CCB0">The large trees on the hills are principally of two &s;orts. One of them, of the &s;ize of our large&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">irs, grows nearly after their manner. This &s;up|plied the place of &s;pruce in making beer; which we did, with a decoction of its leaves fermented with &s;ugar or treacle; and this liquor was ac|knowledged to be little inferior to American &s;pruce-beer. The other &s;ort of tree is like a maple, and often grows very large, but is fit only for fuel; the wood of that, and of the preceding, being too heavy for ma&s;ts, yards, &amp;c.</P>
<P>A greater variety of trees grow on the flats be|hind the beaches: two of the&s;e bear a kind of plumb, of the &s;ize of prunes; the one, which is yellow, is called karraca, and the other, which is black, called maitao; but neither of them had a plea&s;ant ta&s;te, though eaten both by our people and the natives.</P>
<P>On the eminences which jut out into the &s;ea, grows a &s;pecies of philadelphus, and a tree bearing flowers almo&s;t like myrtle. We u&s;ed the leaves of the philadelphus as tea, and found them an ex|cellent &s;ub&s;titute for the oriental &s;ort.</P>
<P>A kind of wild celery, which grows plentifully in almo&s;t every cove, may be reckoned among the plants that were u&s;eful to us; and another that we u&s;ed to call &s;curvy-gra&s;s. Both &s;orts were boiled daily with wheat ground in a mill, for the people's breakfa&s;t, and with their pea&s;e-&s;oup for dinner. Sometimes al&s;o they were u&s;ed as &s;alled,
<PB N="81" REF="030274_0130_0FE56BAC2A9BB318">
or dre&s;&s;ed as greens. In all which ways they are excellent; and, together with the fi&s;h, with which we were amply &s;upplied, they formed a mo&s;t de|&s;irable refre&s;hment.</P>
<P>The known kinds of plants to be found here are bindweed, night-&s;hade, nettles, a &s;hrubby &s;peed-well, &s;ow-thi&s;tles, virgin's bower, vanelloe, French willow, euphorbia, crane's-bill, cudweed, ru&s;hes, bulru&s;hes, flax, all-heal, American night-&s;hade, knot-gra&s;s, brambles, eye-bright, and ground&s;el; but the &s;pecies of each are different from any we have in Europe.</P>
<P>There are a great number of other plants, but one in particular de&s;erves to be noticed here, as the garments of the natives are made from it. A fine &s;ilky flax is produced from it, &s;uperior in appearance to any thing we have in this country, and, perhaps, as &s;trong. It grows in all places near the &s;ea, and &s;ometimes a con&s;iderable way up the hills, in bunches or tufts, bearing yellowi&s;h flowers on a long &s;talk.</P>
<P>It is remarkable that the greate&s;t part of the trees and plants were of the berry-bearing kind; of which, and other &s;eeds, Mr. Ander&s;on brought away about thirty different &s;orts.</P>
<P>The birds, of which there is a tolerable good &s;tock, are almo&s;t entirely peculiar to the place. It would be difficult and fatiguing to follow them, on account of the quantity of underwood, and the climbing plants; yet any per&s;on, by conti|nuing
<PB N="82" REF="030274_0131_0FE56BADB3D6E790">
in one place, may &s;hoot as many in a day as would &s;erve &s;even or eight per&s;ons. The prin|cipal kinds are large brown parrots, with grey heads, green parroquets, large wood-pigeons, and two &s;orts of cuckoos. A gro&s;s-beak, about the &s;ize of a thru&s;h, is frequent; as is al&s;o a &s;mall green bird, which is almo&s;t the only mu&s;ical one to be found here; but his melody is &s;o &s;weet, and his notes &s;o varied, that any one would ima|gine him&s;elf &s;urrounded by a hundred different &s;orts of birds, when the little warbler is exerting him&s;elf. From this circum&s;tance it was named the mocking-bird. There are al&s;o three or four &s;orts of &s;maller birds, and, among the rocks, are found black &s;ea-pies with red bills, and crefted &s;hags of a leaden colour. About the &s;hore, there are a few &s;ea-gulls, &s;ome blue herons, wild ducks, plo|vers, and &s;ome &s;and-larks. A &s;nipe was &s;hot here, which differs but little from that of Europe.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t of the fi&s;h we caught by the &s;eine were elephant-fi&s;h, mullets, &s;oles, and flounders; but the natives &s;upplied us with a &s;ort of &s;ea-bream, large conger eels, and a fi&s;h of five or &s;ix pounds weight, called a mogge by the natives. With a hook and line we caught a blacki&s;h fi&s;h, called cole-fi&s;h by the &s;eamen, but differing greatly from that of the &s;ame name in Europe. We al&s;o got a &s;ort of &s;mall &s;almon, &s;kate, gurnards, and nur&s;es. The natives &s;ometimes furni&s;hed us with hake, paracutas, parrot-fi&s;h, a &s;ort of mac|karel,
<PB N="83" REF="030274_0132_0FE56BAF9F30D530">
and leather jackets; be&s;ides another, which is extremely &s;carce, of the figure of a dolphin, a black colour, and &s;trong bony jaws. The&s;e, in general, are excellent to eat; but the &s;mall &s;al|mon, cole-fi&s;h, and mogge, are &s;uperior to the others.</P>
<P>Great quantities of excellent mu&s;cles inhabit among the rocks; one &s;ort of which exceeds a foot in length. Many cockles are found buried in the &s;and of the &s;mall beaches; and, in &s;ome places, oy&s;ters, which, though very &s;mall, have a good flavour. There are al&s;o perriwincles, lim|pets, wilks, &s;ea-eggs, &s;tar-fi&s;h, and &s;ome beau|tiful &s;ea-ears, many of which are peculiar to the place. The natives al&s;o furni&s;hed us with &s;ome excellent cray-fi&s;h.</P>
<P>In&s;ects here are not very numerous; we &s;aw &s;ome butterflies, two &s;orts of dragon-flies, &s;ome &s;mall gra&s;shoppers, &s;everal &s;orts of &s;piders, &s;ome black ants, and &s;corpion flies innumerable, with who&s;e chirping the woods re&s;ounded. The &s;and-fly, which is the only noxious one, is very nume|rous here, and is almo&s;t as di&s;agreeable as the mu&s;quitoe. The only reptiles we &s;aw here, were two or three &s;orts of inoffen&s;ive lizards.</P>
<P>In this exten&s;ive land, it is remarkable that there &s;hould not even be the traces of any qua|druped, except a few rats, and a kind of fox dog, which is kept by the natives as a dome&s;tic animal.</P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="030274_0133_0FE56BB35B374518">They have not any mineral de&s;erving notice, but a green ja&s;per or &s;erpent &s;tone, of which the tools and ornaments of the inhabitants are made. This is held in high e&s;timation among them; and they entertain &s;ome &s;uper&s;titious notions about the mode of its generation, which we could not comprehend; they &s;ay it is taken from a large river far to the &s;outhward; it is di&s;po&s;ed in the earth in detached pieces like flints, and, like them, the edges are covered with a whiti&s;h cru&s;t.</P>
<P>The natives, in general, are not &s;o well formed, e&s;pecially about the limbs, as the Europeans, nor do they exceed them in &s;tature. Their &s;itting &s;o much on their hams, and being deprived, by the mountainous di&s;po&s;ition of the country, of u&s;ing that kind of exerci&s;e which would render the body &s;traight and well-proportioned, is probably the occa&s;ion of the want of due proportion. Many of them, indeed, are perfectly formed, and &s;ome are very large boned and mu&s;cular; but very few among them were corpulent.</P>
<P>Their features are various, &s;ome re&s;embling Europeans, and their colour is of different ca&s;ts, from a deepi&s;h black to an olive or yellowi&s;h tinge. In general, however, their faces are round, their lips rather full, and their no&s;es (though not flat) large towards the point. An aquiline no&s;e was not to be &s;een among them: their eyes are large, and their teeth are commonly broad, white, and regular. The hair, in general, is
<PB N="85" REF="030274_0134_0FE56BB543545B20">
black, &s;trong, and &s;traight; it is commonly cut &s;hort on the hinder part, and the re&s;t tied on the crown of the head. Some, indeed, have brown hair, and others a &s;ort that is naturally di&s;po&s;ed to curl. The countenance of the young is gene|rally free and open; but, in many of the men, it has a &s;erious or &s;ullen ca&s;t. The men are larger than the women; and the latter are not di&s;tin|gui&s;hed by peculiar graces, either of form or features.</P>
<P>Both &s;exes are cloathed alike; they have a gar|ment, made of the &s;ilky flax already mentioned, about five feet in length, and four in breadth. This appears to be their principal manufacture, which is performed by knotting. Two corners of this garment pa&s;s over the &s;houlders, and they fa&s;ten it on the brea&s;t with that which covers the body: it is again fa&s;tened about the belly with a girdle made of mat. Sometimes they cover it with dog-&s;kin or large feathers. Many of them wear mats over this garment, extending from the &s;houlders to the heels. The mo&s;t common co|vering, however, is a quantity of the &s;edgy plant above-mentioned, badly manufactured, fa&s;tened to a &s;tring, and thrown over the &s;houlders, whence it falls down on all &s;ides to the middle of the thighs. When they &s;at down in this habit, they could hardly be di&s;tingui&s;hed from large grey &s;tones, if their black heads did not project beyond their coverings.</P>
<P><PB N="86" REF="030274_0135_0FE56BB6CD81C768">They adorn their heads with feathers, combs of bone or wood, with pearl &s;hell, and the inner &s;kin of leaves. Both men and women have their ears &s;lit, in which are hung beads, pieces of ja&s;|per, or bits of cloth. Some have the <HI>&s;eptum</HI> of the no&s;e bored in its lower part, but we never &s;aw any ornament worn in that part; though a twig was pa&s;&s;ed through it by one of them, to &s;hew that it was occa&s;ionally u&s;ed for that pur|po&s;e.</P>
<P>Many are &s;tained in the face with curious figures, of a black or dark blue colour; but it is not certain whether this is intended to be or|namental, or as a mark of particular di&s;tinction: the women are marked only on their lips and chins; and both &s;exes be&s;mear their heads and faces with a grea&s;y reddi&s;h paint. The women al&s;o wear necklaces of &s;hark's teeth, or bunches of long beads; and a few of them have &s;mall triangular aprons, adorned with feathers or pieces of pearl &s;hells, fe&s;tened about the wai&s;t with a double or treble &s;et of cords.</P>
<P>They live in the &s;mall coves already mention|ed, &s;ometimes in &s;ingle families, and &s;ometimes in companies of perhaps forty or fifty. Their huts, which are in general mo&s;t mi&s;erable lodg|ing places, are built cont<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">guous to each other. The be&s;t we &s;aw was built in the manner of one of our country barns, and was about &s;ix feet in height, fifteen in breadth, and thirty-three in
<PB N="87" REF="030274_0136_0FE56BB8A23D4240">
length. The in&s;ide was &s;trong and regular, well fa&s;tened by means of withes, &amp;c. and painted red and black. At one end it had a hole &s;erving as a door to creep out at, and another con&s;ider|ably &s;maller, &s;eemingly for the purpo&s;e of letting out the &s;moke. This, however, ought to be con|&s;idered as one of their palaces, for many of their huts are not of half the &s;ize, and &s;eldom are more than four feet in height.</P>
<P>They have no other furniture than a few &s;mall bags or ba&s;kets, in which they depo&s;it their fi&s;h|ing hooks and other trifles. They &s;it down in the middle round a &s;mall fire, and probably &s;leep in the &s;ame &s;ituation, without any other covering that what they have worn in the day.</P>
<P>Fi&s;hing is their principal &s;upport, in which they u&s;e different kinds of nets, or wooden fi&s;h-hooks pointed with bone; but made in &s;o extraordinary a manner, that it appears a&s;toni&s;hing how they can an&s;wer &s;uch a purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Their bo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">s con&s;i&s;t of planks rai&s;ed upon each other, and fa&s;tened with long withes. Many of them are fifty feet long. Sometimes they fa&s;ten two together with rafters, which we call a double canoe: they frequently carry upwards of thirty men, and have a large head, ingeniou&s;ly carved and painted, which &s;eems intended to re|pre&s;ent a man enraged. Their paddles are nar|row, pointed, and about five feet long. Their
<PB N="88" REF="030274_0137_0FE56BBDE5072428">
&s;ail, which is very little u&s;ed, is a mat formed into a triangular &s;hape.</P>
<P>They dre&s;s their fi&s;h by roa&s;ting, or rather baking them, being entirely ignorant of the art of boiling. It is thus they al&s;o dre&s;s the root of the large fern-tree, in a hole prepared for that purpo&s;e: when dre&s;&s;ed, they &s;plit it, and find a gelatinous &s;ub&s;tance within, &s;omewhat like &s;ago powder. The &s;maller fern-root &s;eems to be their &s;ub&s;titute for bread, being dried and carried about with them, together w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">h great quantities of dried fi&s;h, when they go far from their habita|tions.</P>
<P>When the weather will not &s;uffer them to go to &s;ea, mu&s;cles and &s;ea-ears &s;upply the place of other fi&s;h. Sometimes, but not often, they kill a few penguins, rails, and &s;hags, which enable them to vary their diet. Con&s;iderable numbers of their dogs are al&s;o bred for food; but they de|pend principally on the &s;ea for their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, by which they are mo&s;t bountifully &s;upplied.</P>
<P>They are as filthy in their feeding as in their per&s;ons, which often emit a very offen&s;ive ef|fluvia, from the quantity of grea&s;e about them, and from their never wa&s;hing their cloaths: their heads are plentifully &s;tocked with vermin, which they &s;ometimes eat. Large quantities of &s;tink|ing train oil, and blubber of &s;eals, they would eagerly devour. When on board the &s;hips, they not only emptied the lamps, but actually &s;wal|lowed
<PB N="89" REF="030274_0138_0FE56BBFE650AB88">
the cotton with equal voracity. Though the inhabitants of Van Diemen's Land would not even ta&s;te our bread, the&s;e people devoured it with the greate&s;t eagerne&s;s, even when it was rot|ten and mouldy.</P>
<P>In point of ingenuity, they are not behind any uncivilized nations under &s;imilar circum&s;tances: for, without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of metal tools, they make every thing by which they procure their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, cloathing, and warlike weapons, with neatne&s;s, &s;trength, and convenience. Their prin|cipal mechanical tool is formed in the manner of an adze, and is made of the &s;erpent-&s;tone or ja&s;|per: their chi&s;&s;el and gouge are furni&s;hed from the &s;ame material, though they are &s;ometimes compo&s;ed of black &s;olid &s;tone. Carving, how|ever, is their ma&s;ter-piece, which appears upon the mo&s;t trifling things; the ornaments on the heads of their canoes not only di&s;play much de&s;ign, but execution. Their cordage for fi&s;hing lines is not inferior to that in this country, and their nets equally good. A &s;hell, a bit of flint, or ja&s;per, is their &s;ub&s;titute for a knife; and a &s;hark's tooth fixed in the end of a piece of wood, is their auger. They have a &s;aw made of &s;ome jagged fi&s;hes teeth, fixed on a piece of wood nicely carved; but this is u&s;ed for no other purpo&s;e than to cut up the bodies of tho&s;e whom they kill in battle.</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="030274_0139_0FE56BC16C6F84D0">Though no people are more ready to re&s;ent an injury, yet they take every opportunity of being in&s;olent, when they apprehend there is no danger of puni&s;hment; whence it may be concluded, that their eagerne&s;s to re&s;ent injuries, is rather an effect of a furious di&s;po&s;ition than genuine bra|very. They are naturally mi&s;tru&s;tful, and &s;u&s;pi|cious, for &s;uch as are &s;trangers never venture im|mediately to vi&s;it our &s;hips, but keep at a &s;mall di&s;tance in their boats, ob&s;erving our motions, and he&s;itating whether they &s;hould ri&s;k their &s;afety with us. They are to the la&s;t degree di&s;hone&s;t, and &s;teal every thing within their reach, if they &s;uppo&s;e they can e&s;cape detection; and, in trad|ing, they &s;eem inclined to take every po&s;&s;ible ad|vantage; for they never tru&s;t an article out of their hands for examination, and &s;eem highly plea&s;ed if they have over-reached you in a bar|gain.</P>
<P>Such conduct indeed is not &s;urpri&s;ing, when it is con&s;idered that there appears to be but little &s;ubordination, and few, if any, laws for the pu|ni&s;hment of tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors. No man's authority extends beyond his own family; and when they join, at any time, for mutual defence or &s;afety, tho&s;e among them who are mo&s;t eminent for valour and prudent conduct, are directors.</P>
<P>Their public contentions are almo&s;t perpetual, for war is their principal profe&s;&s;ion, as appears from their number of weapons, and their dex|terity
<PB N="91" REF="030274_0140_0FE56BC344F32A88">
in u&s;ing them. Their arms are &s;pears, pa|toos and halberts, and &s;ometimes &s;tones, The fir&s;t are from five to thirty feet long, made of hard wood and pointed. The patoo is about eighteen inches long, of an elliptical &s;hape, with a handle made of wood, &s;tone, &amp;c. and appears to be their principal dependance in battle. The halbert is about five or &s;ix feet in length, tapering at one end with a carved head, and broad or flat, with &s;harp edges, at the other.</P>
<P>Before the on&s;et, they join in a war &s;ong, keep|ing the exacte&s;t time; and, by degrees, work them&s;elves into a kind of frantic fury, accom|panied with the mo&s;t horrid di&s;tortions of their tongues, eyes and mouths, in order to deter their enemies. To this &s;ucceeds a circum&s;tance that is mo&s;t horrid, cruel, and di&s;graceful to hu|man nature, which is mangling and cutting to pieces (even when not perfectly dead) the bodies of their enemies; and, after roa&s;ting them, de|vouring the fle&s;h with peculiar plea&s;ure and &s;a|tisfaction.</P>
<P>It might naturally be &s;uppo&s;ed, that tho&s;e who could be capable of &s;uch exce&s;s of cruelty, mu&s;t be totally de&s;titute of every humane feeling; and yet they lament the lo&s;s of their friends in a man|ner the mo&s;t tender and affectionate. Both men and women, upon the death of their relations or friends, bewail them with the mo&s;t mi&s;erable cries; at the &s;ame time cutting large ga&s;hes in

their cheeks and foreheads, with &s;hells, or pieces of flint, till the blood flows copiou&s;ly, and mixes with their tears. They al&s;o carve a re&s;emblance of an human figure, and hang it about their necks, as a memorial of tho&s;e who were dear to them. They al&s;o perform the ceremony of lamenting and cutting for joy, at the return of a friend who has been &s;ome time ab&s;ent.</P>
<P>The practices of the fathers, whether good or bad, their children are, at an early age, in&s;truct|ed in; &s;o that you find a child of either &s;ex, of the age of nine or ten years, able to imitate the frightful motions and ge&s;tures of the men.

<P>Their language is neither har&s;h nor di&s;agree|able. Whatever qualities are requi&s;ite to make a language mu&s;ical, obtain to a con&s;iderable degree in this, if we may judge from the melody of their &s;ongs.

&s;oon as we had lo&s;t &s;ight of land, our two young New-Zealanders heartily reperted of the adven|turous &s;tep they had taken. Though we endea|voured, as far as lay in our power, to &s;ooth them, they wept, both in public and private; and gave vent to their &s;orrows in a kind of &s;ong, which &s;eemed to expre&s;s their prai&s;es of their country and people, from which they were now, in all pro|bability, to be for ever &s;eparated. They conti|nued in this &s;tate for &s;everal days, till, at length, the agitation of their minds began to &s;ub&s;ide, and their &s;ea-&s;ickne&s;s, which had aggravated their grief, wore off. Their lamentations then became le&s;s and le&s;s frequent; their native country, their kin|dred and friends, were gradually forgotten, and they appeared to be firmly attached to us.</P>
<P>On the 28th at noon, being in the latitude of 41&deg; 17&prime; &s;outh, and in the longitude of 177&deg; 17&prime; ea&s;t, we tacked about and &s;tood to the &s;outh-ea&s;t, with a gentle breeze at ea&s;t north-ea&s;t, which af|terwards veered to north-ea&s;t, in which point the wind remained two days, &s;ometimes blowing a fre&s;h gale with &s;qualls and rain. On the 2d of March it &s;hifted to north-we&s;t, and afterwards to &s;outh-we&s;t, between which point and the north it continued to blow, &s;ometimes very moderately, and at other times a &s;trong gale. With this wind we &s;teered north-ea&s;t by ea&s;t and ea&s;t, with all the &s;ail we could carry, till Tue&s;day the 11th, when
<PB N="95" REF="030274_0144_0FE56BCB04DCEB38">
it veered to north-ea&s;t and &s;outh-ea&s;t; we then &s;tood to the north and the north-ea&s;t, as the wind would permit, till the 16th, when having a gale from the north, we &s;tood to the ea&s;t. The next day we proceeded to the north-ea&s;t; but, as the wind frequently veered to ea&s;t and ea&s;t-north-ea&s;t, we often made no better than a northerly cour&s;e. The hopes, however, of the wind coming more &s;outherly, or from the we&s;t|ward, a little without the Tropic of Capricorn, encouraged the Commodore to continue this cour&s;e. It was indeed nece&s;&s;ary that we &s;hould run all hazards, as our proceeding to the north this &s;ummer, in pro&s;ecution of the principal ob|ject of the expedition, entirely depended on our having a quick pa&s;&s;age to Otaheite, or the So|ciety I&s;les.</P>
<P>We cro&s;&s;ed the Tropic on the 27th, the wind, for a con&s;iderable time before, having remained almo&s;t invariably fixed at ea&s;t &s;outh-ea&s;t. In all this run, we ob&s;erved nothing that could induce us to &s;uppo&s;e we had &s;ailed near any land, except occa&s;ionally a tropic bird. In the latitude of 34&deg; 20&prime;, longitude 199&deg;, we pa&s;&s;ed the trunk of a tree, which appeared much weather-beaten, and was covered with barnacles. On the 29th, as we were &s;tanding to the north-ea&s;t, the Di&s;co|very made a &s;ignal of &s;eeing land. We &s;oon found it to be a &s;mall i&s;land, and &s;tood for it till the evening, when it was at the di&s;tance of two
<PB N="96" REF="030274_0145_0FE56BCCF8B50378">
or three leagues. The next morning, at day|break, we bore up fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the we&s;t &s;ide of the i&s;land, and &s;aw &s;everal people wading to the reef, where, as they ob&s;erved the &s;hip leaving them quickly, they remained. But others, who &s;oon appeared, followed her cour&s;e; and &s;ome of them a&s;&s;embled in &s;mall bodies, making great &s;houts.</P>
<P>Upon our nearer approach to the &s;hore, we &s;aw many of the natives running along the beach, and, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of our gla&s;&s;es, could per|ceive that they were armed with long &s;pears and clubs, which they brandi&s;hed in the air with &s;igns of threatening, or, as &s;ome of us &s;uppo&s;ed, with invitations to land. Mo&s;t of them were naked, except having a kind of girdle, which was brought up between their thighs; but &s;ome of them wore about their &s;houlders pieces of cloth of various colours, white, &s;triped, or chequered; and almo&s;t all of them had about their heads a white wrap|per, in &s;ome degree re&s;embling a turban. They were of a tawny complexion, robu&s;t, and about the middle &s;ize.</P>
<P>A &s;mall canoe was now launched from the mo&s;t di&s;tant part of the beach, and a man get|ting into it, put off, as with a view of reaching the &s;hip; but his courage failing, he quickly re|turned towards the beach. Another man &s;oon after joined him in the canoe; and then both of them paddled towards us. They &s;eemed, how|ever, afraid to approach, till their apprehen&s;ions
<PB N="97" REF="030274_0146_0FE56BD2DD5E5F20">
were partly removed by Omai, who addre&s;&s;ed them in the language of Otaheite. Thus encou|raged, they came near enough to receive &s;ome nails and beads, which, being tied to &s;ome wood, were thrown into the canoe. They however put the wood a&s;ide without untying the things from it, which may perhaps have proceeded from &s;u|per&s;tition; for we were informed by Omai, that when they ob&s;erved us offering pre&s;ents to them, they reque&s;ted &s;omething for their <HI>Eatooa.</HI> On Omai's a&s;king them whether they ever eat human fle&s;h, they replied in the negative, with equal abhorrence and indignation. One of them, named Mourooa, being que&s;tioned with regard to a &s;car on his forehead, &s;aid it was the con&s;equence of a wound he had received in fighting with the na|tives of an i&s;land lying towards the north-ea&s;t, who &s;ometimes invaded them. They afterwards laid hands on a rope, but would not venture on board, telling Omai, that their countrymen on &s;hore had &s;ugge&s;ted to them this caution; and had likewi&s;e directed them to enquire whence our &s;hip came, and to procure information of the name of the Captain. Their chief, they &s;aid, was called Orooaeeka. Upon our enquiring the name of the i&s;land, they told us it was <HI>Mangya,</HI> or <HI>Mangeea,</HI> to which they &s;ometimes added <HI>nooe, nai, naiwa.</HI></P>
<P>The features of Mourooa were agreeable, and his di&s;po&s;ition, to all appearance, was no le&s;s &s;o;

The lobe of their ears was &s;lit to &s;uch a length, that one of them &s;tuck their a knife and &s;ome beads, which we had given them. The &s;ame per&s;on had hung about his neck, by way of ornament, two poli&s;hed pearl-&s;hells, and a bunch of human hair, loo&s;ely twi&s;ted together.

part was of white wood; but the upper part was black, and their paddles were made of wood of the &s;ame colour: the&s;e were broad at one end, and blunted, and about three feet long. The fore part had a flat board fa&s;tened over it, which projected out, to prevent the water from getting in. It had an upright &s;tern, five feet high, which terminated at the top in a kind of fork. They paddled indifferently either end of the canoe for|ward.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the &s;hips were in a proper &s;tation, Captain Cook &s;ent out two boats to endeavour to find a convenient place for landing. In one of them he went him&s;elf, and had no &s;ooner put off from the &s;hip, than the two men in the canoe paddled towards his boat; and when they were come along-&s;ide, Mourooa, without he&s;itation, &s;tept into her. Omai, who was with the Cap|tain, was de&s;ired to enquire of the i&s;lander where we could land; upon which he directed us to two places. But we &s;oon ob&s;erved, with regret, that the attempt at either place was impracticable, on account of the &s;urf, unle&s;s at the ri&s;que of having our boats de&s;troyed. Nor were we more &s;uc|ce&s;sful in our &s;earch for anchorage, as we could find no bottom till within a cable's length of the breakers, where we met with from forty to twenty fathoms depth, over &s;harp rocks of coral.</P>
<P>While we thus reconnoitred the &s;hore of Man|geea, the natives thronged down upon the reef,
<PB N="100" REF="030274_0150_0FE56BDBE5607758">
all armed. Mourooa, who &s;till remained in the boat with Captain Cook, thinking, perhaps, that this warlike appearance deterred us from land|ing, commanded them to retire. As many of them complied, we imagined, that he was a per|&s;on of &s;ome con&s;equence: indeed, if we did not mi&s;under&s;tand him, he was brother to the king of the i&s;land. Several of them, in&s;tigated by curio&s;ity, &s;wam from the &s;hore to the boats, and came on board them without re&s;erve. We even found &s;ome difficulty in keeping them out, and could &s;carce prevent their pilfering whatever they could lay hands upon. At length, when they ob&s;erved us returning to the &s;hips, they all left us except Mourooa, who, though not with|out manife&s;t indications of fear, accompanied the Commodore on board the Re&s;olution. The cattle and other new objects that he &s;aw there, did not &s;trike him with much &s;urprize; his mind, perhaps, benig too much occupied about his own &s;afety, to allow him to attend to other things. He &s;eemed very unea&s;y, and gave us but little new intelligence; and therefore, after he had continued a &s;hort time on board, Captain Cook ordered a boat to carry him towards the land. In his way out of the cabin, happening to &s;tumble over one of the goats, he &s;topped, looked at the animal, and a&s;ked Omai what bird it was; but not receiving an immediate an&s;wer from him, he put the &s;ame que&s;tion to &s;ome of the people who
<PB N="101" REF="030274_0151_0FE56BDE43BE0200">
were upon deck. The boat having conveyed him near the &s;urf, he leaped into the water, and &s;wam a&s;hore. His countrymen, eager to learn from him what he had &s;een, flocked round him as &s;oon as he had landed; in which &s;ituation they remained when we lo&s;t &s;ight of them. We hoi&s;ted in the boat as &s;oon as &s;he returned, and made &s;ail to the northward. Thus were we obliged to leave this fine i&s;land unvi&s;ited, which &s;eemed capable of &s;upplying all our nece&s;&s;ities. It is &s;ituate in the longitude of 210&deg; 53&prime; ea&s;t, and in the latitude of 21&deg; 57&prime; &s;outh.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e parts of the coa&s;t of Mangeea which fell under our ob&s;ervation, are guarded by a reef of coral rock, again&s;t which a heavy &s;urf is con|tinually breaking. The i&s;land is about five leagues in circumference, and though of a mo|derate and pretty equal height, may be &s;een in clear weather at the di&s;tance of ten leagues. In the interior parts, it ri&s;es into &s;mall hills, whence there is an ea&s;y de&s;cent to the &s;hore, which, in the &s;outh-we&s;t part, is &s;teep, though not very high, and has &s;everal excavations made by the da&s;hing of the waves again&s;t a browni&s;h &s;and-&s;tone, of which it con&s;i&s;ts. The de&s;cent here abounds with trees of a deep green, which &s;eem to be all of one &s;ort, except neare&s;t the &s;hore, where we ob&s;erved numbers of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;pecies of <HI>dracoena</HI> found in the woods of New-Zealand. The &s;hore, on the north-we&s;t part, terminates in a &s;andy,
<PB N="102" REF="030274_0152_0FE56BDFCD4579E8">
beach, beyond which the land is broken into &s;mall cha&s;ms, and has a broad border of trees which re&s;emble tall willows. Further up, on the a&s;cent, the trees were of the deep green above|mentioned, which &s;ome of us imagined to be the <HI>rima,</HI> intermixed with cocoa-palms, and a few other &s;orts. Some trees of a higher &s;ort were thinly &s;cattered on the hills, the other parts of which were either covered with &s;omething like fern, or were bare, and of a reddi&s;h colour. The i&s;land, upon the whole, has a plea&s;ing appearance, and might, by proper cultivation, be made a beau|tiful &s;pot.</P>
<P>The natives appearing to be both numerous and well-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed, it is highly probable that &s;uch arti|cles of provi&s;ion as the i&s;land produces are found in great abundance. Our friend Mourooa in|formed us, that they had no hogs nor dogs, though they had heard of both tho&s;e animals; but that they had plaintains, taro, and bread-fruit. The only birds we ob&s;erved, were &s;ome terns, noddies, white egg-birds, and one white heron.</P>
<P>The language of the Mangeeans is a dialect of that of Otaheite; but their pronunciation is more guttural.

practi&s;ed by the Otaheiteans in their dances. We had likewi&s;e rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e, that they have &s;imilar methods of living: for, though we had not an opportunity of &s;eeing many of their habitations, we ob&s;erved one hou&s;e near the beach, which, in its mode of con&s;truction, differed little from tho&s;e of Otaheite. It appeared to be &s;even or eight feet high, and about thirty in length, with an open end, which repre&s;ented an ellip&s;e, or oval, tran&s;ever&s;ely divided.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>WE quitted Mangeea in the afternoon of the 30th of March, and proceeding on a nor|therly cour&s;e, we again di&s;covered land, on the 31&s;t, at the di&s;tance of nine or ten leagues.&mdash; The next morning we were abre&s;t of its north end, within four leagues of it. It now appeared to us to be an i&s;land nearly of the &s;ame extent with that which we had ju&s;t left. Another i&s;land, much &s;maller, was al&s;o de&s;cried right a-head. Though we could &s;oon have reached this, we preferred the larger one, as being mo&s;t likely to
<PB N="105" REF="030274_0155_0FE5489366C896C0">
furni&s;h food for the cattle. We therefore made &s;ail to it; but there being little wind, and that unfavourable, we were &s;till about two leagues to leeward at eight o'clock the &s;ucceeding morn|ing. The Commodore, &s;oon after, di&s;patched three armed boats, under the command of Mr. Gore, his Fir&s;t Lieutenant, in &s;earch of a land|ing-place and anchoring-ground. Mean while we plied up under the i&s;land with the &s;hips. As our boats were putting off, we &s;aw &s;everal canoes coming from the &s;hore, which repaired fir&s;t to the Di&s;covery, as that &s;hip was the neare&s;t. Not long after, three of the&s;e canoes, each conducted by one man, came along-&s;ide of the Re&s;olution. They are long and narrow, and are &s;upported by out-riggers: the head is flat above, but prow-like below; and the &s;tern is about four feet high. We be&s;towed on our vi&s;itors, &s;ome knives, beads, and other trifles; and they gave us &s;ome cocoa-nuts, in con&s;equence of our having a&s;ked for them; but they did not part with them by way of exchange, as they &s;eemed to have no idea of barter or traffic. One of them, after a little per&s;ua&s;ion, came on board; and the other two &s;oon followed his example. They appeared to be perfectly at their ea&s;e, and free from all ap|prehen&s;ion. After their departure, a man ar|rived in another canoe, bringing a bunch of plantains as a pre&s;ent to Captain Cook, who gave him, in return, a piece of red cloth and an axe.
<PB N="106" REF="030274_0156_0FE56BE8181B0540">
We were afterwards informed by Omai, that this pre&s;ent had been &s;ent from the king of the i&s;land. Soon after, a double canoe, containing twelve of the i&s;landers, came towards us. On approaching the &s;hip, they recited &s;ome words in concert, by way of chorus, one of them fir&s;t giving the word before each repetition. Having fini&s;hed this &s;olemn chant, they came along-&s;ide, and a&s;ked for the chief. As &s;oon as Captain Cook had made his appearance, a pig and &s;ome cocoa-nuts were conveyed into the &s;hip; and the Captain was al&s;o pre&s;ented with a piece of matting, by the principal per&s;on in the canoe, when he and his companions had got on board.</P>
<P>The&s;e new vi&s;itors were introduced into the cabin, and conducted to other parts of the &s;hip. Though &s;ome objects &s;eemed to &s;urpri&s;e them, no|thing could fix their attention. They were afraid to venture near the cows and hor&s;es, of who&s;e nature they could form no conception. As for the &s;heep and goats, they gave us to under&s;tand, that they knew them to be birds. It is a mat|ter of a&s;toni&s;hment, that human ignorance could ever make &s;o ridiculous a mi&s;take, as there is not the &s;malle&s;t re&s;emblance between any winged animal and a &s;heep or goat. But the&s;e people &s;eemed unacquainted with the exi&s;tence of any other terre&s;trial animals, than hogs, dogs, and birds; and as they &s;aw that our goats and &s;heep were very different from the two former, they ab|&s;urdly
<PB N="107" REF="030274_0157_0FE56BE99F114EE0">
inferred, that they mu&s;t belong to the lat|ter cla&s;s, in which they knew there was a great variety of &s;pecies. Though the Commodore be|&s;towed on his new friend what he &s;uppo&s;ed would be the mo&s;t acceptable pre&s;ent, yet he &s;eemed &s;omewhat di&s;appointed. The Captain was after|wards informed, that he eagerly wi&s;hed to pro|cure a dog, of which kind of animals this i&s;land was de&s;titute, though the natives knew that the race exi&s;ted in other i&s;lands of the Pacific Ocean. Captain Clerke had received a &s;imilar pre&s;ent, with the &s;ame view, from another man, who was equally di&s;appointed in his expectations.</P>
<P>The i&s;landers whom we had &s;een in tho&s;e canoes were in general of the middle &s;tature, and not unlike the Mangeeans. Their hair either flowed loo&s;ely over their &s;houlders, or was tied on the crown of the head; and though in &s;ome it was frizzled, yet that, as well as the &s;traight &s;ort, was long. Some of the young men were hand&s;ome. Like the inhabitants of Mangeea, they were gir|dles of glazed cloth, or fine matting, the ends of which were brought between their thighs.&mdash; Their ears were bored, and they wore about their necks, by way of ornament, a &s;ort of broad gra&s;s, &s;tained with red, and &s;trung with berries of the night-&s;hade. Many of them were curiou&s;ly mark|ed or <HI>tatooed</HI> from the middle downwards, parti|cularly upon their legs; which made them appear as if they wore boots. Their beard<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> were long<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="108" REF="030274_0158_0FE56BEDF7F539D0">
and they had a kind of &s;andals on their feet. They were frank and chearful in their deportment, and very friendly and good-natured.</P>
<P>Lieutenant Gore returned from his excur&s;ion in the afternoon, and informed Captain Cook, that he had examined the we&s;t &s;ide of the i&s;land, without being able to find a place where the &s;hips could ride in &s;afety, or a boat could land, the &s;hore being bounded by a &s;teep coral rock, again&s;t which a continual &s;urf broke with extraordinary violence. But as the inhabitants &s;eemed extreme|ly friendly, and as de&s;irous of our landing as we our&s;elves were, Mr. Gore was of opinion, that they might be prevailed upon to bring off to the boats beyond the &s;urf, &s;uch articles as we were mo&s;t in need of. As we had little or no wind, the delay of a day or two was of &s;mall con&s;idera|tion; and therefore the Commodore re&s;olved to try the experiment the next morning. We ob|&s;erved, &s;oon after day-break, &s;ome canoes com|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ng towards the &s;hips; one of which directed its <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">our&s;e to the Re&s;olution.

part with them. However, to gratify the&s;e peo|ple, Omai gave them a favourite dog he had brought from Great-Britain; with which acqui|&s;ition they were highly plea&s;ed.</P>
<P>The &s;ame morning, which was the 3d of April, Captain Cook detached Mr. Gore with three boats, to make trial of the experiment which that officer had propo&s;ed. Two of the natives, who had been on board, accompanied him; and Omai &s;erved as an interpreter. The &s;hips being a full league from the i&s;land when the boats put off, and the wind being incon&s;iderable, it was twelve o'clock before we could work up to it. We then perceived our three boats ju&s;t without the &s;urf, and an amazing number of the i&s;landers on the &s;hore, abrea&s;t of them. Concluding from this, that Lieutenant Gore, and others of our people had landed, we were impatient to know the event. With a view of ob&s;erving their motions, and be|ing ready to afford them &s;uch a&s;&s;i&s;tance as they might occa&s;ionally require, the Commodore kept as near the &s;hore as was con&s;i&s;tent with prudence. He was convinced, however, that the reef was a very effectual barrier between us and our friends who had landed, and put them completely out of the reach of our protection. But the natives, in all probability, were not &s;o &s;en&s;ible of this circum&s;tance as we were. Some of them, now and then, brought a few cocoa-nuts to the &s;hips, and exchanged them for whatever was of|fered
<PB N="110" REF="030274_0160_0FE56BF15BE82658">
them. The&s;e occa&s;ional vi&s;its dimini&s;hed the Captain's &s;olicitude about our people who had landed; for, though we could procure no intelligence from our vi&s;itors, yet their ventur|ing on board &s;eemed to imply, that their country|men on &s;hore had made no improper u&s;e of the confidence repo&s;ed in them. At length, towards the evening, we had the &s;atisfaction of &s;eeing the boats return. When our people got on board, we found that Mr. Gore, Mr. Ander&s;on, Mr. Burney, and Omai, were the only per&s;ons who had landed. The occurrence of the day were now fully reported to the Commodore by Mr. Gore. Mr. Ander&s;on's account of their tran&s;ac|tions, which was very circum&s;tantial, and includ|ed &s;ome ob&s;ervations, on the i&s;land and it's inha|bitants, was to the following purport.</P>
<P>They rowed towards a &s;andy beach, where a great number of the natives had a&s;&s;embled, and came to an anchor at the di&s;tance of an hundred yards from the reef. Several of the i&s;landers &s;wam off, bringing cocoa-nuts with them; and Omai gave them to under&s;tand, that our people were de&s;irous of landing. Soon after, two canoes came off; and to in&s;pire the natives with a greater confidence, Mr. Gore and his companions re|&s;olved to go unarmed. Mr. Ander&s;on and Lieu|tenant Burney went in the canoe, a little before the other; and their conductors watching with great attention the motions of the &s;urf, landed
<PB N="111" REF="030274_0161_0FE56BF355480B38">
them &s;afely on the reef. A native took hold of each of them, with a view of &s;upporting them in walking over the rugged rocks to the beach, where &s;everal others, holding in their hands the green boughs of a &s;pecies of <HI>mimo&s;a,</HI> met them, and &s;alu|ted them by the junction of no&s;es. They were conducted from the beach amid&s;t a va&s;t multitude of people, who flocked around them with the mo&s;t eager curio&s;ity; and being led up an avenue of of cocoa palms, &s;oon came to a number of men, arranged in two rows, and armed with clubs. Proceeding onward among the&s;e, they found a per&s;on, who appeared to be a chief, &s;itting cro&s;s-legged on the ground, and cooling him&s;elf with a kind of triangular fan, made from the leaf of the cocoa-palm, with a poli&s;hed handle of black wood. He wore in his ears large bunches of beautiful feathers of a red colour; but had no other mark to di&s;tingui&s;h him from the re&s;t of the people. Our two countrymen having &s;aluted him as he &s;at, marched on among the men armed with clubs, and came to a &s;econd chief, adorned like the former, and occupied, like him, in fanning him&s;elf. He was remarkable for his &s;ize and corpulence, though he did not appear to be above thirty years of age. They were con|ducted in the &s;ame manner to a third chief, who &s;eemed older than the two former: he al&s;o was &s;itting, and was ornamented with red feathers. After they had &s;aluted him as they had done the
<PB N="112" REF="030274_0162_0FE56BFA1F0A6940">
others, he de&s;ired them both to &s;it down: which they willingly con&s;ented to, being greatly fatigued with walking, and with the extreme heat they felt amid&s;t the &s;urrounding multitude.</P>
<P>The people being ordered to &s;eparate, Me&s;&s;rs. Ander&s;on and Burney &s;aw, at a &s;mall di&s;tance, about twenty young women, adorned like the chiefs with red feathers, engaged in a dance, which they performed to a &s;low and &s;olemn air, &s;ung by them all. Our two gentlemen ro&s;e up, and walking forward to &s;ee the&s;e dancers, who, with|out paying them the &s;malle&s;t attention, &s;till con|tinued their dance. They &s;eemed to be directed by a man, who, in the capacity of a prompter, mentioned the &s;everal motions they were to make. They never changed the &s;pot, as Europeans do in dancing, and though their feet were not entirely at re&s;t, this exerci&s;e con&s;i&s;ted more in mov|ing their fingers very nimbly, holding their hands at the &s;ame time in a prone po&s;ition near the face, and occa&s;ionally clapping them together<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The dances here de&s;cribed, bear a great re&s;emblance to tho&s;e of the natives of the Caroline I&s;lands.</NOTE>. Their dancing and &s;inging were performed in the ex|acte&s;t concert. They had probably been in&s;tructed with extraordinary care, and &s;elected for this cere|mony, being &s;uperior in beauty to mo&s;t of tho&s;e who were in the crowd. They were, in general, rather &s;tout, and of an olive complexion, with black hair flowing in ringlets down their necks.
<PB N="113" REF="030274_0163_0FE56BFBA6E9AF68">
Their &s;hape and limbs were elegantly formed; for, their dre&s;s con&s;i&s;ting only of a piece of glazed cloth tied round the wai&s;t, which &s;carcely reached &s;o low as the knees, our gentlemen had an oppor|tunity of ob&s;erving almo&s;t every part. Their fea|tures were rather too full to con&s;titute a perfect beauty. Their eyes were of a deep black, and their countenances expre&s;&s;ed a great degree of mo|de&s;ty and complacency.</P>
<P>Before the&s;e beauteous females had fini&s;hed their dance, our two countrymen heard a noi&s;e, as if &s;ome hor&s;es had been galloping towards them; and on turning their eyes a&s;ide, they &s;aw the people armed with clubs, who had been de|&s;ired to entertain them, as they &s;uppo&s;ed, with an exibition of their mode of fighting; which they now did, one party pur&s;uing another who ran a|way.</P>
<P>Lieutenant Burney and Mr. Ander&s;on began now to look about for Mr. Gore and Omai, whom they at length found coming up, as much incom|moded by the crowds of people as them&s;elves had been, and introduced in the &s;ame manner to the three chiefs; the names of whom were Otteroo, Taroa, and Fatouweera. Each of the&s;e expect|ing a pre&s;ent, Mr. Gore gave them &s;uch things as he had brought with him for that purpo&s;e; af|ter which he informed the chiefs of his views in coming on &s;hore, but was de&s;ired to wait till the next day before he &s;hould have what was wanted.
<PB N="114" REF="030274_0164_0FE56C6DA22F2CC8">
They now &s;eemed to endeavour to &s;eparate our gentlemen from each other, every one of whom had his re&s;pective circle to &s;urround, and gaze at him. Mr. Ander&s;on was, at one time, upwards of an hour apart from his friends; and when he told the chief, who was near him, that he wi&s;hed to &s;peak to Omai, his reque&s;t was peremptorily refu&s;ed. At the &s;ame time he found that the people pilfered &s;everal trifling things which were in his pocket; and on his complaining of this treatment to the chief, he ju&s;tified their beha|viour. From the&s;e circum&s;tances, Mr. Ander|&s;on began to apprehend, that they de&s;igned to detain our party among them. In this &s;ituation he a&s;ked for &s;omething to eat; upon which they brought him &s;ome cocoa-nuts, bread-fruit, and a &s;ort of &s;our pudding; and when he com|plained of the heat, occa&s;ioned by the multitude of people, the chief him&s;elf conde&s;cended to fan him.</P>
<P>Mr. Burney going to the place where Mr. An|der&s;on was, the latter informed him of his &s;u&s;pi|cions; and to try whether they were well founded or not, they both attempted to get to the beach: but they were &s;oon &s;topped by &s;ome of the na|tives, who &s;aid they mu&s;t return to the place which they had left. On their coming up they found Omai under the &s;ame apprehen&s;ions; but he had, as he imagined, an additional motive of terror; for, having ob&s;erved that they had dug a
<PB N="115" REF="030274_0165_0FE56C6FEEEB6210">
hole in the ground for an oven, which they were then heating, he could a&s;&s;ign no other rea|&s;on for it, than that they intended to roa&s;t and devour our party: he even went &s;o far as to a&s;k them whether that was their intention, at which they were much &s;urpri&s;ed, a&s;king, in return, whe|ther that cu&s;tom prevailed among us.</P>
<P>Thus were Mr. Ander&s;on and the others de|tained the greate&s;t part of the day, being &s;ome|times &s;eparated, and &s;ometimes together; but continually in a croud, who frequently de&s;ired them to uncover parts of their &s;kin, the &s;ight of which &s;truck the i&s;landers with admiration. They at the &s;ame time rifled the pockets of our coun|trymen; and one of them &s;natched from Mr. Gore a bayonet, which hung by his &s;ide. This being repre&s;ented to one of the chiefs, he pre|tended to &s;end a per&s;on in &s;earch of it, but pro|bably countenanced the theft; for Omai, &s;oon after, had a dagger &s;tolen from his &s;ide in the &s;ame manner. They now brought &s;ome green boughs as emblems of friend&s;hip, and &s;ticking the ends of them in the ground, de&s;ired that our party would hold them as they &s;at, giving them to under&s;tand, that they mu&s;t &s;tay and eat with them. The &s;ight of a pig lying near the oven which they had prepared and heated, removed Omai's apprehen&s;ions of being put into it him|&s;elf, and made him think it might be intended for the repa&s;t of him and his three friends.
<PB N="116" REF="030274_0166_0FE56C758B1F61B0">
The chief al&s;o &s;ent &s;ome of his people to provide food for the cattle, and they returned with a few plantain trees, which they conveyed to the boats. In the mean time, Me&s;&s;rs. Burney and Ander&s;on made a &s;econd attempt to get to the beach; but, on their arrival, they found them&s;elves watched by people who &s;eemed to have been &s;tationed there for that purpo&s;e; for, when Mr. Ander&s;on endeavoured to wade in upon the reef, one of them dragged him back by his clothes. They al&s;o in&s;i&s;ted upon his throwing down &s;ome pieces of coral that he had picked up, and on his refu&s;al to comply, they took them from him by force. Nor would they &s;uffer him to retain &s;ome &s;mall plants which he had gathered. They likewi&s;e took a fan from Mr. Burney, which on his com|ing a&s;hore he had received as a pre&s;ent. Finding that obedience to their will was the only me|thod of procuring better treatment, the gentle|men returned to the place they had quitted; and the natives now promi&s;ed, that after they had partaken of a repa&s;t which had been prepared for them, they &s;hould be furni&s;hed with a canoe to carry them off to their boats. Accordingly, the &s;econd chief to whom they had been pre&s;ented, having &s;eated him&s;elf on a low &s;tool, and directed the multitude to form a large ring, made them &s;it down by him. A number of cocoa-nuts were now brought, with a quantity of baked plantains, and a piece of the pig that had been dre&s;&s;ed was
<PB N="117" REF="030274_0167_0FE56C77A157E768">
placed before each of them. Their fatigue, how|ever, had taken away their appetites; but they eat a little to plea&s;e their entertainers. It being now near &s;un-&s;et, the i&s;landers &s;ent down to the beach the remainder of the provi&s;ions that had been dre&s;&s;ed, to be carried to the &s;hips. Our gentlemen found a canoe prepared to put them off to their boats, which the natives did with great caution; but as they were pu&s;hing the canoe into the &s;urf, one of them &s;natched a bag out of her, which contained a pocket-pi&s;tol belonging to Mr. Ander&s;on, who calling out to the thief with marks of the highe&s;t di&s;plea&s;ure, he &s;wam back to the canoe with the bag. The i&s;landers then put them on board the boats, with the cocoa-nuts, plan|tains, and other provi&s;ions; and they immediately rowed back to the &s;hips.</P>
<P>The re&s;trained &s;ituation of the&s;e gentlemen gave them very little opportunity of ob&s;erving the country: for they were &s;eldom a hundred yards from the place where they had been intro|duced to the chiefs, and con&s;equently were con|fined to the &s;urrounding objects. The fir&s;t thing that attracted their notice was the number of people, which mu&s;t have been at lea&s;t two thou|&s;and. Except a few, tho&s;e who had come on board the &s;hips were all of an inferior cla&s;s; for a great number of tho&s;e that our gentlemen met with on &s;hore, had a &s;uperior dignity of demeanor, and their complexion was much whiter. In gen|neral,
<PB N="118" REF="030274_0168_0FE56C792B4D6360">
they had their hair, which was long and black, tied on the crown of the head. Many of the young men were perfect models in &s;hape, and of a delicate complexion. The old men were, many of them, corpulent; and they as well as the young, had a remarkable &s;moothne&s;s of &s;kin. Their general dre&s;s con&s;i&s;ted of a piece of cloth wrapped about the wai&s;t, but &s;ome had pieces of mats, very curiou&s;ly variegated with black and white, formed into a kind of a jacket without &s;leeves; while others wore conical caps made of the core of a cocoa-nut, interwoven with beads. In their ears, which were pierced, they hung pieces of the membraneous part of &s;ome plant, or &s;tuck there &s;ome odoriferous flower. The chiefs, and other per&s;ons of rank, had two little balls, with a common ba&s;e, made of bone; which they hung round their necks with &s;mall cord. Red feathers are here con&s;idered as a particular mark of di&s;|tinction; for none but chiefs, and the young women who danced, a&s;&s;umed them. Some of the men were punctured all over the &s;ides and back, and &s;ome of the women had the &s;ame or|nament (if it de&s;erves that name) on their legs. The elderly women had their hair cropped &s;hort, and many of them were cut all over the fore part of the body in oblique lines. The wife of a chief appeared with her child, laid in a piece of red cloth, which had been pre&s;ented to her hu&s;|band; &s;he &s;uckled the infant much after the man|ner
<PB N="119" REF="030274_0169_0FE56C7B04988380">
of our women. Another chief introduced his daughter, who was young, beautiful, and mode&s;t. No per&s;onal deformities were ob&s;erved in either &s;ex, except in a few individuals who had &s;cars of broad ulcers remaining on the face and other parts.</P>
<P>Many of the natives were armed with &s;pears and clubs, the latter of which were generally about &s;ix feet long, made of a hard black wood, neatly poli&s;hed. The &s;pears were formed of the &s;ame wood, &s;imply pointed, and were in general twelve feet long; but &s;ome were &s;o &s;hort as to &s;eem in|tended for darts.</P>
<P>They pre&s;erved their canoes from the &s;un under the &s;hade of various trees. Our gentlemen &s;aw eight or ten of them, all double ones; that is, two &s;ingle ones fa&s;tened together by rafters la&s;hed acro&s;s. They were about four feet deep, and in length about twenty feet, and the &s;ides were round|ed with a plank rai&s;ed upon them. Two of the&s;e canoes were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">uriou&s;ly &s;tained all over with black, in innumerable &s;mall figures, as triangles, &s;quares, &amp;c. and were far &s;uperior to any thing of the kind Mr. Ander&s;on had ever &s;een at any other i&s;land in the South Sea. The paddles were almo&s;t elliptical, and about four feet long.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t of the trees ob&s;erved by Mr. Ander&s;on, were cocoa-palms, &s;ome &s;pecies of <HI>hibi&s;cus,</HI> a &s;ort of <HI>euphorbia,</HI> and many of the &s;ame kind he had &s;een at Mangeea. The latter are tall and &s;len|der,

re&s;embling a cypre&s;s; and are called by the natives <HI>etoa.</HI> He al&s;o &s;aw a &s;pecies of <HI>convolvulus,</HI> and &s;ome treacle-mu&s;tard; be&s;ides which there are doubtle&s;s other plants and fruit-trees which he had not an opportunity of &s;eeing. The &s;oil, to|wards the &s;ea, is nothing more than a bank of coral, generally &s;teep and rugged, which, though it has probably been for many centuries expo&s;ed to the weather, has &s;uffered no further change than becoming black on its &s;urface. The reef or rock, with which the &s;hore is lined, runs to different breadths into the &s;ea, where it re&s;embles a high &s;teep wall: it is of a browni&s;h colour, and nearly even with the &s;urface of the water; and though its texture is rather porous, it is capable of with&s;tanding the wa&s;hing of the &s;urf which con|&s;tantly breaks upon it.</P>
<P>Though the landing of our gentlemen was the means of enriching the narrative of the voyage with the preceding particulars, the principal ob|ject in view was partly unattained; for we &s;carce procured any thing worth mentioning from the i&s;land.</P>
<P>It has been already ob&s;erved, that Omai was &s;ent upon this expedition as Mr. Gore's interpre|ter; which, perhaps, was not the only &s;ervice he performed this day. He was que&s;tioned by the natives concerning us, our country, our &s;hips and arms; in an&s;wer to which, he told them, among many other particulars, that our country
<PB N="121" REF="030274_0171_0FE56C8296ED9D18">
had &s;hips as large as their i&s;land, on board of which were implements of war (de&s;cribing our guns) of &s;uch dimen&s;ions, as to contain &s;everal people within them; one of which would demo|li&s;h the i&s;land at one &s;hot. As for the guns in our two &s;hips, he acknowledged they were but &s;mall in compari&s;on with the former; yet even with the&s;e, he &s;aid we could with great ea&s;e, at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance de&s;troy the i&s;land and every &s;oul in it. On their enquiring by what means this could be done, Omai produced &s;ome cartridges from his pocket, and having &s;ubmitted to in&s;pection the balls, and the gunpowder by which they were to be &s;et in motion, he di&s;po&s;ed the latter upon the ground, and, by means of a piece of lighted wood, &s;et it on fire. The &s;udden bla&s;t, the mingled flame and &s;moke, that in|&s;tantaneou&s;ly &s;ucceeded, filled the natives with &s;uch a&s;toni&s;hment, that they no longer doubted the formidable power of our weapons. Had it not been for the terrible ideas they entertained of the guns of our &s;hips, from this &s;pecimen of their mode of operation, it was imagined that they would have detained the gentlemen the whole night; for Omai a&s;&s;ured them, that, if he and his friends did not return on board the &s;ame day, they might expect that the Commodore would fire up|on the i&s;land.</P>
<P>Though this i&s;land had never before been vi|&s;ited by Europeans, there were other &s;trangers
<PB N="122" REF="030274_0172_0FE56C841F3C0860">
now re&s;iding in it; and it was entirely owing to Omai's accompanying Mr. Gore, that this re|markable circum&s;tance came to our knowledge. He had &s;carcely landed on the beach, when he found among the crowd, three of his own coun|trymen, natives of the Society I&s;les. At the di&s;|tance of about two hundred leagues from tho&s;e i&s;lands, an immen&s;e ocean intervening, with &s;uch mi&s;erable &s;ea-boats as their inhabitants make u&s;e of, &s;uch a meeting, at &s;uch a place, &s;o acciden|tally vi&s;ited by us, may be con&s;idered as one of tho&s;e extraordinary and unexpected &s;ituations, which &s;trike a curious ob&s;erver with wonder and amazement. The mutual &s;urprize and plea&s;ure with which Omai and his countrymen engaged in conver&s;ation, may ea&s;ily be imagined. Their &s;tory, as related by them&s;elves, is a very affecting one. About twenty per&s;ons, male and female, had embarked in a canoe at Otaheite, with an intention of cro&s;&s;ing over to Ulietea; but they were prevented by contrary winds from reaching the latter, or returning to the former i&s;land. Their &s;tock of provi&s;ions being &s;oon exhau&s;ted, they &s;uffered inconceivable hard&s;hips. They pa&s;&s;ed many days without &s;u&s;tenance, in con&s;e|quence of which their number gradually dimi|ni&s;hed, worn out by famine and fatigue. Only four men &s;urvived, when their canoe was over&s;et. The de&s;truction of this &s;mall remnant now &s;eem|ed inevitable; however, they continued hanging
<PB N="123" REF="030274_0173_0FE56C85A7ABBF18">
by the &s;ide of the ve&s;&s;el, during &s;ome of the la&s;t days, till they providentially came in &s;ight of the inhabitants of this i&s;land, who &s;ent out canoes and brought them on &s;hore. One of the&s;e four had &s;ince died. The other three were &s;o well &s;a|ti&s;fied with the generous treatment they met with here, that they refu&s;ed the offer made them by our gentlemen, at the reque&s;t of Omai, of taking them on board our &s;hips, and re&s;toring them to their native i&s;lands. They had arrived upon this coa&s;t at lea&s;t twelve years ago. Their names were Tavee, Otirreroa, and Orououte: the for|mer was born at Huahenie, the &s;econd at Ulietea, and the latter at Otaheite. The application of the preceding narrative is obvious. It will &s;erve to explain, in a more &s;atisfactory manner than the flim&s;y conjectures of &s;ome &s;peculative rea&s;oners, how the detached parts of the world, and, in particular, the i&s;lands of the Pacific Ocean, may have been fir&s;t peopled; tho&s;e e&s;pecially which lie at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance from each other, or from any inhabited continent.</P>
<P>The natives of this i&s;land call it by the name of Wateeoo. It is &s;ituated in the longitude of 201&deg; 45&prime; ea&s;t, and in the latitude of 20&deg; 1&prime; &s;outh; and is about &s;ix leagues in circuit. It is a beau|tiful &s;pot, with a &s;urface covered with verdure, and compo&s;ed of hills and plains. The &s;oil, in &s;ome parts, is light and &s;andy: but, further up the country, we &s;aw from the &s;hip, by the a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance
<PB N="124" REF="030274_0174_0FE56C89D7CE2D60">
of our gla&s;&s;es, a reddi&s;h ca&s;t on the ri&s;ing grounds. There the i&s;landers build their hou&s;es, for we could perceive &s;everal of them, which were long and &s;pacious. Its produce is nearly the &s;ame with that of Mangeea Nooe Nainaiwa, the i&s;land we had la&s;t quitted.</P>
<P>If we may depend on Omai's report of what he learned from his three countrymen in the cour&s;e of conver&s;ation, the manners of the people of Wa|teeoo, their general habits of life, and their me|thod of treating &s;trangers, greatly re&s;emble tho&s;e that prevail at Otaheite, and its neighbouring i&s;lands. There is al&s;o a great &s;imilarity between their religious opinions and ceremonies. From every circum&s;tance, indeed, it may be con&s;idered as indubitable, that the inhabitants of Wateeoo derive their de&s;cent from the &s;ame &s;tock which has &s;o remarkably diffu&s;ed it&s;elf over the immen&s;e extent of the Southern Ocean. Omai a&s;&s;ured us that they dignified their i&s;land with the pompous appellation of <HI>Wenooa no te Eatoa,</HI> implying <HI>a land of Gods;</HI> e&s;teeming them&s;elves a kind of divinities, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with the &s;pirit of the <HI>Eatoa.</HI> T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eir lan|guage was equally well under&s;tood by Omai, and by our two New Zealanders who were on board: its peculiarites, when compared with the other dia|lects we cannot point out; for the memorandum-book, in which Mr. Ander&s;on had put down a &s;pecimen o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> it, was &s;tolen by the natives.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>CALMS and light airs having alternately prevailed all the night of the 3d. of April, before day-break the ea&s;terly &s;well nad carried the &s;hips &s;ome di&s;tance from <HI>Wateeoo</HI>; but having failed of procuring, at that place, &s;ome effectual &s;upply, there appeared no rea&s;on for our conti|nuing there any longer; we therefore willingly quitted it, and &s;teered for the i&s;land which we had di&s;covered three days before.</P>
<P>We got up with it about ten o'clock in the morning, when Captain Cook immediately di&s;|patched Mr. Gore with two boats, to &s;ee if he could land, and get &s;ub&s;i&s;tence for our cattle. Though a reef &s;urrounded the land here, as at <HI>Wateeoo,</HI> and a con&s;iderable &s;urf broke again&s;t the rocks, our boats no &s;ooner reached the we&s;t &s;ide
<PB N="126" REF="030274_0176_0FE56C8D5F45A938">
of the i&s;land, but they ventured in, and Mr. Gore and his attendants arrived &s;afe on &s;hore. Captain Cook, &s;eeing they had &s;o far &s;ucceeded, &s;ent a &s;mall boat to know if farther a&s;&s;i&s;tance was re|quired. She waited to take in a lading of the produce of the i&s;land, and did not return till three o'clock in the afternoon: being cleared, &s;he was &s;ent again for another cargo; the jolly boat was al&s;o di&s;patched upon the &s;ame bu&s;ine&s;s, with orders for Mr. Gore to return vith the boats be|fore night, which orders were punctually ob&s;erv|ed.</P>
<P>The &s;upply obtained here was about two hun|dred cocoa-nuts for our&s;elves, and for our cattle &s;ome gra&s;s, and a quantity of the leaves and branches of young cocoa trees, and the pandanus.</P>
<P>This i&s;land lies about three or four leagues from <HI>Wateeoo,</HI> the inhabitants of which call it <HI>Otakootaia.</HI> It is in the latitude of 19&deg; 15&prime; &s;outh, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he longitude of 201&deg; 37&prime; ea&s;t, and is &s;uppo&s;ed not to exceed three miles in circuit.</P>
<P>This i&s;land is entirely de&s;titute of water. Cocoa-palms were the only common trees found there, of which there were &s;everal clu&s;ters, and great quantities of the <HI>wharra,</HI> or <HI>pandanus.</HI> There were al&s;o the <HI>callophyllum, &s;uriana,</HI> with a few other &s;hrubs; al&s;o a &s;ort of <HI>bind-weed, treacle-mu&s;tard,</HI> a &s;pecies of <HI>&s;purge,</HI> and the <HI>morinda citri|folia</HI>; the fruit of which is &s;ometimes eaten by the natives of Otaheite. Omai, who landed with
<PB N="127" REF="030274_0177_0FE56C8EE5F98AD8">
the party, dre&s;&s;ed &s;ome of it for their dinner, but they thought it very indifferent.</P>
<P>A beautiful cuckoo, of a che&s;nut brown, varie|gated with black, was the only bird &s;een among&s;t the trees; but, upon the &s;hore, were a &s;mall &s;ort of curlew, blue and white herons, &s;ome egg-birds&punc; and great numbers of noddies.</P>
<P>One of the company caught a lizard running up a tree; though &s;mall it had a mo&s;t forbidding a&s;pect. Many of another &s;ort were al&s;o &s;een. Infinite numbers of a kind of moth, elegantly &s;peckled with black, white, and red, frequented the bu&s;hes towards the &s;ea. Some other &s;orts of moths and pretty butterflies were &s;een.</P>
<P>At this time there were no fixed inhabitants upon the i&s;land; but we di&s;covered a few empty huts, which convinced us of its being, at lea&s;t occa&s;ionally vi&s;ited. Monuments, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;everal large &s;tones, were al&s;o erected under the &s;hade of &s;ome trees: there were al&s;o &s;ome &s;maller ones, with which &s;everal places were inclo&s;ed, where we &s;uppo&s;ed their dead had been buried. We found in one place a great many cockle-&s;hells of a particular &s;ort, finely grooved, and larger than the fi&s;t; from which it was conjec|tured, that the i&s;land had been vi&s;ited by per&s;ons who &s;ometimes feed on &s;hell-fi&s;h. Mr. Gore left &s;ome nails and a hatchet in one of the huts, for the u&s;e of tho&s;e who might vi&s;it the i&s;land in fu|ture.</P>
<P><PB N="128" REF="030274_0178_0FE56C960EF96790">The boats being hoi&s;ted in, we made &s;ail again to the northward, re&s;olving to try our fortune at Hervey's i&s;land, which was di&s;covered by Captain Cook in 1773, during his la&s;t voyage, We got &s;ight of it about day break in the morning of the 6th, at the di&s;tance of about three leagues. We approached it about eight o'clock, and ob&s;erved &s;everal canoes coming from the &s;hore towards the &s;hips. We were rather &s;urprized at this circum|&s;tance, as no traces or &s;igns of inhabitants were &s;een when the i&s;land was fir&s;t di&s;covered: this indeed, might be owing to a bri&s;k wind that then blew, and prevented their canoes venturing out.</P>
<P>Advancing &s;till towards the i&s;land, &s;ix or &s;even double canoes immediately came near us, with from three to &s;ix men in each of them. At the di&s;tance of about a &s;tone's throw from the &s;hip they &s;topped, and it was with difficulty that Omai prevailed on them to come along &s;ide; but they could not be induced to tru&s;t them&s;elves on board. They attempted to &s;teal &s;ome oars out of the Di&s;|covery's boat, and &s;truck a man for endeavouring to prevent them. They al&s;o cut away a net contain|ing meat, which hung ov<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r the &s;tern of that &s;hip, and at fir&s;t would not re&s;tore it, though they after|wards permitted us to purcha&s;e it from them. Tho&s;e who were about the Re&s;olution behaved equally di&s;orderly and daring; for, with a &s;ort of hooks
<PB N="129" REF="030274_0179_0FE56C97F362F7E0">
made of a long &s;tick, they openly endeavoured to rob us of &s;everal things, and actually got a frock belonging to one of our people. It appeared that they had a knowledge of bartering, for they exchanged &s;ome fi&s;h for &s;ome of our &s;mall nails, of which they were extravagantly fond, and called them <HI>goore.</HI> Pieces of paper, or any other trifling articles that was thrown to them, they caught with the greate&s;t avidity; and if what was thrown fell into the &s;ea, they immediately plunged in to &s;wim after it.</P>
<P>Though the di&s;tance between Hervey's I&s;land and Wateeoo is not very great, the inhabitants differ greatly from each other, both in per&s;on and di&s;po&s;ition. The colour of the natives of Hervey's I&s;land is of a deeper ca&s;t, and &s;everal of them had a fierce &s;avage a&s;pect, like the natives of New-Zealand, though &s;ome were fairer. Their hair was long and black, either hanging loo&s;e about their &s;houlders, or tied in a bunch on the top of the head. Some few, indeed, had it cropped &s;hort, and, in two or three of them, it was of a red or browni&s;h colour. Their clothing was a narrow piece of mat, bound &s;everal times round the lower part of the body, and pa&s;&s;ing between the thighs. We &s;aw a fine cap of red feathers lying in one of the canoes, and &s;ome among&s;t them were ornamented with the &s;hell of a pearl-oy&s;ter, poli&s;hed, and hung about the neck.</P>
<P><PB N="130" REF="030274_0180_0FE56C998098DCD0">The mode of ornament, &s;o prevalent among the natives of this ocean, of puncturing or tatooing their bodies, not one of them had adopted; but though they were &s;ingular in this re&s;pect, their being of the &s;ame common race is not to be doubted. Their language more re&s;embled the dialect of Otaheite, than that of Mangeea or Wa|teeoo. Like the natives of tho&s;e i&s;lands, they enquired from whence we came, whither bound, the &s;hip's name, the name of our chief, and the number of men on board. Such que&s;tions as we propo&s;ed to them, they very readily an&s;wered. They informed us, among other things that they had before &s;een two large &s;hips like ours, but had not &s;poken to them as they pa&s;&s;ed. The&s;e were, doubtle&s;s, the Re&s;olution and Adventure. They acquainted us, that the name of their i&s;land was Terouggemou Atooa; and that they were &s;ubject to Teerevatooeah, King of Wateeoo.</P>
<P>Their food, they &s;aid, con&s;i&s;ted of cocoa-nuts, fi&s;h, and turtle; being de&s;titute of dogs and hogs, and the i&s;land not producing bread fruit or plan|tains. Their canoes (near thirty of which ap|peared one time in &s;ight) are tolerably large, and well built, and bear &s;ome re&s;emblance to tho&s;e of Wateeoo.</P>
<P>We drew near the north-we&s;t part of the i&s;land about one o'clock. This &s;eemed to be the only part where we could expect to find anchorage, or a landing-place for our boats. Captain Cook
<PB N="131" REF="030274_0181_0FE56C9BCBA46860">
immediately di&s;patched Lieutenant King, with two armed boats, to &s;ound and reconn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">tre the coa&s;t. The boats were no &s;ooner hoi&s;ted out, than our new vi&s;itors &s;u&s;pended their traffic with us, pu&s;hing for &s;hore as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible, and came no more near us.</P>
<P>The boats returned at three o'clock, and Mr. King informed Captain Cook that he could find no anchorage for the &s;hips; and that the boats could advance no farther than the outer edge of the reef, which was almo&s;t a quarter of a mile from the dry land. That a number of the natives came upon the reef, armed with clubs and long pikes, meaning, as he &s;uppo&s;ed, to oppo&s;e his landing; though, at the &s;ame time, they threw cocoa-nuts to our people, and reque&s;ted them to come on &s;hore; and notwith&s;tanding this &s;eem|ing friendly treatment, the women were very active in bringing down a fre&s;h &s;upply of darts and &s;pears.</P>
<P>Captain Cook con&s;idered that as we could not bring the &s;hips to an anchor, the attempt to pro|cure gra&s;s here would be attended with delay and danger. Being thus di&s;appointed in all the i&s;lands after our leaving New-Zealand, and having, from variety of circum&s;tances, been unavoidably re|tarded in our progre&s;s, it was in vain to think of doing any thing this year in the high latitudes of the nothern hemi&s;phere, from which we were then &s;o far di&s;tant, though it was then the &s;ea&s;on
<PB N="132" REF="030274_0182_0FE56CA2B89F7FA8">
for our operations there. Thus &s;ituated, it was nece&s;&s;ary to pur&s;ue &s;uch mea&s;ures as appeared be&s;t calculated to pre&s;erve our cattle, and &s;ave the &s;tores and provi&s;ions of the &s;hips; the better to enable us to pro&s;ecute our nothern di&s;coveries, which could not now commence till a year later than was intended.</P>
<P>If we could fortunately have procured a &s;upply of water and gra&s;s, at any of the i&s;lands we had lately vi&s;ited, Captain Cook intended to have &s;tood back to the &s;outh till he had got a we&s;terly wind. But, without &s;uch a &s;upply, the certain con&s;equence of doing this, would have been the lo&s;s of the cattle before it was po&s;&s;ible for us to reach Otaheite, without gaining a &s;ingle point of advantage re&s;pecting the grand object of our voy|age.</P>
<P>The Captain, therefore, determined to bear away for the Friendly I&s;lands, where he knew he could be well &s;upplied with everything he wanted: and, it being nece&s;&s;ary to run night and day, he ordered Captain Clerke to keep a league a-head of the Re&s;olution; becau&s;e his &s;hip could be&s;t claw of the land, which we might po&s;&s;ibly fall in with in our pa&s;&s;age.</P>
<P>We &s;teered we&s;t by &s;outh, with a fine breeze. Captain Cook propo&s;ed to proceed fir&s;t to Mid|dleburgh, or Eooa, thinking we might, perhaps, have provi&s;ion enough for the cattle, to la&s;t till we &s;hould arrive at that i&s;land. But the next day
<PB N="133" REF="030274_0183_0FE56CA4D1A4FF90">
about noon, tho&s;e faint breezes that had &s;o long retarded us, again returned; and we found it ne|ce&s;&s;ary to get into the latitude of Palmer&s;ton's and Savage I&s;lands, which Captain Cook di&s;co|vered in 1774; that, in ca&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity, recour&s;e might be had to them.</P>
<P>In order to &s;ave our water, Captain Cook or|dered the &s;till to be kept at work a whole day; during which time we procured about fifteen gal|lons of fre&s;h water.</P>
<P>The&s;e light breezes continued till Thur&s;day the 10th, when the wind blew &s;ome hours fre&s;h from the north, and north north-we&s;t. In the afternoon we had &s;ome very heavy rain, attended with thunder &s;qualls. We collected as much rain-water as filled five of our puncheons. When the&s;e &s;qualls had blown over, the wind was very un&s;ettled, both in &s;trength and in po&s;ition, till the next day at noon, when it fixed at north-we&s;t, and north north-we&s;t, and blew a fre&s;h breeze.</P>
<P>We were thus per&s;ecuted with a wind in our teeth, and had the additional mortification to find tho&s;e very winds here, which we had rea&s;on to expect farther &s;outh. At day break, however, on the 13th, we perceived Palmer&s;ton's I&s;land, bearing we&s;t by &s;outh, at the di&s;tance of about five leagues; but did not get up with it till the next morning at eight. Captain Cook then di&s;|patched three boats from the Re&s;olution, and one from the Di&s;covery, with a proper officer in each,
<PB N="134" REF="030274_0184_0FE56CA65A800EC0">
to &s;earch for a convenient landing place; we be|ing now under an ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of procuring here &s;ome provender for our cattle, or we mu&s;t cer|tainly have lo&s;t them.</P>
<P>What is called Palmer&s;ton's I&s;land, con&s;i&s;ts of a group of &s;mall i&s;lets, about nine or ten in num|ber, connected together by a reef of coral rocks, and lying in a circular direction. The boats fir&s;t examined the mo&s;t &s;outh ea&s;terly i&s;let; and not &s;ucceeding there, ran down to the &s;econd, where they immediately landed. Captain Cook then bore down with the &s;hips, till we were a-brea&s;t of the place, where we kept &s;tanding off and on, there being no bottom to be found to anchor upon. This, however, was of no material con|&s;equence, as there were no human beings upon the i&s;land, except the party who had landed from our boats.</P>
<P>At one o'clock one of the boats returned, laden with &s;curvy-gra&s;s and young cocoa-trees, which was, at this time, a mo&s;t excellent repa&s;t for our animals on board. A me&s;&s;age was al&s;o brought from Mr. Gore, who commanded the party upon this expedition, acquainting us that the i&s;land abounded with &s;uch produce, and al&s;o with the wharra-tree and cocoa-nuts. In con&s;e|quence of this information, Captain Cook re|&s;olved to get a &s;ufficient &s;upply of the&s;e articles before he quitted this &s;tation, and accordingly went a-&s;hore in a &s;mall boat, accompanied by the
<PB N="135" REF="030274_0185_0FE56CA82ED6BCE8">
Captain of the Di&s;covery. The i&s;land does not exceed a mile in circumference, and is not ele|vated above three feet beyond the level of the &s;ea. It con&s;i&s;ted almo&s;t entirely of a coral &s;and, with a &s;mall mixture of blacki&s;h mould, which appeared to be produced from rotten vegetables.</P>
<P>This poor &s;oil is, however, covered with the &s;ame kind of &s;hrubs and bu&s;hes as we had &s;een at Otakootia or Wenooa-ette, though not in &s;o great variety. We perceived a great number of man of war birds, tropic birds, and two &s;orts of boobies, which were then laying their eggs, and &s;o ex|ceedingly tame as to permit us to take them off their ne&s;ts, which con&s;i&s;ts only of a few &s;ticks loo&s;ely put together. The&s;e tropic birds differ e&s;&s;entially from the common &s;ort, being of a beau|tiful white, &s;lightly tinged with red, and having two long tail feathers of a deepi&s;h crim&s;on. Our people killed a con&s;iderable number of each &s;ort, which, though not the mo&s;t delicate kind of food, were highly acceptable to us, who had been for a long time confined to a &s;alt diet. We &s;aw plenty of red crabs creeping about among the trees; and caught &s;everal fi&s;h, which, when the &s;ea retreated, had been left in holes upon the reef.</P>
<P>At one part of the reef, which bounds the lake within, almo&s;t even with the &s;urface, there was a large bed of coral, which afforded a mo&s;t en|chanting pro&s;pect. Its ba&s;e, which was fixed to
<PB N="136" REF="030274_0186_0FE56CADC03377C8">
the &s;hore, extended &s;o far that it could not be &s;een, &s;o that it appeared to be &s;u&s;pended in the water. The &s;ea was then unruffled, and the re|fulgence of the &s;un expo&s;ed the various &s;orts of coral, in the mo&s;t beautiful order; &s;ome parts luxuriantly branching into the water; others ap|pearing in va&s;t variety of figures; and the whole greatly heightened by &s;pangles of the riche&s;t co|lours, glowing from a number of large clams, inter&s;per&s;ed in every part. Even this delightful &s;cene was greatly improved by the multitude of fi&s;hes, that gently glided along, &s;eemingly with the mo&s;t perfect &s;ecurity. Their colours were the mo&s;t beautiful that can be imagined; blue yellow, black, red, &amp;c. far excelling any thing that can be produced by art. The richne&s;s of this &s;ubmarine grotto was greatly increa&s;ed by their various forms; and the whole could not po&s;&s;ibly be &s;urveyed without a plea&s;ing tran&s;port, accompanied, at the &s;ame time, with regret, that a work &s;o a&s;toni&s;hingly elegant &s;hould be conceal|ed in a place &s;o &s;eldom explored by the human eye.</P>
<P>Except a piece of a canoe that was found upon the beach, no traces were di&s;coverable of inhabi|tants having ever been here; and probably that may have been drifted from &s;ome other i&s;land. We were &s;urpri&s;ed, however, at perceiving &s;ome &s;mall brown rats on this little i&s;land; a circum|&s;tance, perhaps, not ea&s;ily accounted for, unle&s;s
<PB N="137" REF="030274_0187_0FE56CB0227D21D0">
we admit the po&s;&s;ibility of their being imported in the canoe, of which we &s;aw the remnant.</P>
<P>The boats being laden, Captain Cook returned on board, leaving Mr. Gore and his party to pa&s;s the night on &s;hore, to be ready for bu&s;ine&s;s early the next morning.</P>
<P>The 15th. like the preceding day, was &s;pent in collecting &s;ub&s;i&s;tence for the cattle, con&s;i&s;ting principally of tender branches of the wharra tree, palm-cabbage, and young cocoa-nut trees. A &s;ufficient &s;upply of the&s;e having been procured by &s;un-&s;et, Captain Cook ordered all the people on board: but having very little wind, he de|termined to employ the next day, by endeavour|ing, from the next i&s;land to leeward, to get &s;ome cocoa-nuts for our people: for this purpo&s;e, we kept &s;tanding off and on all the night; and, about nine o'clock in the morning, we went to the we&s;t-&s;ide of the i&s;lands, and landed, from our boats, with little difficulty. The people immediately employed them&s;elves in gathering cocoa-nuts, which we found in the greate&s;t plenty; but it was a tedious operation to convey them to our boats, being obliged to carry them half a mile over the reef, up to the middle in water. Omai, who accom|panied us, pre&s;ently caught, with a &s;coop-net, as many fi&s;h as &s;upplied the party on &s;hore for din|ner, be&s;ides &s;ending a quantity to each &s;hip. Men of war, and tropic-birds, were found here in abundance; &s;o that we fared mo&s;t &s;umptuou&s;ly.
<PB N="138" REF="030274_0188_0FE56CB1C089A648">
In the&s;e excur&s;ions to the uninhabited i&s;lands, Omai was of the greate&s;t &s;ervice to us. He caught the fi&s;h, and dre&s;&s;ed them, as well as the birds we killed, after the fa&s;hion of his country, with a dexterity and cheerfulne&s;s that did him hon|our. Before night the boats had made two trips, and were each time heavy laden: with the la&s;t, Captain Cook returned on board, leaving his Third Lieutenant, Mr. William&s;on, with a party, to prepare another lading for the boats again&s;t the next morning.</P>
<P>Accordingly, Capt. Cook di&s;patched them about &s;even o'clock, and, by noon, they returned laden. No delay was made in &s;ending them back for ano|ther cargo, with orders for all to be on board by &s;un|&s;et. The&s;e orders being punctually obeyed, we hoi&s;ted in the boats, and &s;ailed to the we&s;tward, with a light air from the north.</P>
<P>The i&s;let we la&s;t came from is &s;omewhat larger than the other, and almo&s;t covered with cocoa-palms. The other productions were the &s;ame as at the fir&s;t i&s;let. On the beach were found two pieces of board, one of which was rudely carved&punc; and an elliptical paddle. The&s;e were, perhaps, a part of the &s;ame canoe, the remains of which we had &s;een on the other beach, the two i&s;lets being within half a mile of each other. There were not &s;o many crabs here as at the la&s;t place, but we found &s;ome &s;corpions and other in&s;ects, and a much greater number of fi&s;h upon the reefs.
<PB N="139" REF="030274_0189_0FE56CB356397FB8">
Among the re&s;t were &s;ome beautiful large &s;potted eels, which would rai&s;e them&s;elves out of the water, and endeavour to bite their pur&s;uers. There were al&s;o &s;nappers, parrot-fi&s;h, and a brown &s;potted rock-fi&s;h, not larger than a haddock, &s;o tame, that it would remain fixed, and gaze at us. If we had been really in want, a &s;ufficient &s;up|ply might ea&s;ily have been had, for thou&s;ands of the clams &s;tuck upon the reef, many of which weighed two or three pounds. There were al&s;o &s;ome other &s;orts of &s;hell-fi&s;h; and, when the tide flow|ed, &s;everal &s;harks came with it, &s;ome of which were killed by our people; but their pre&s;ence rendered it, at that time, un&s;afe to walk into the water.</P>
<P>Mr. William&s;on and his party, who were left on &s;hore, were much pe&s;tered in the night with mu&s;|quitoes. Some of them &s;hot two curlews, and &s;aw &s;ome plovers upon the &s;hore; one or two cuckoos, like tho&s;e at Wenooa-ette, were al&s;o &s;een.</P>
<P>The i&s;lets comprehended under the name of Palmer&s;ton's I&s;land, may be &s;aid to be the &s;ummits of a reef of coral-rock, covered only with a thin coat of &s;and; though clothed with trees and plants, like the low grounds of the high i&s;lands of this ocean.</P>
<P>Having left Palmer&s;ton's I&s;land, we &s;teered we&s;t, in order to proceed to Annamooka. We had variable winds, with &s;qualls, &s;ome thunder, and much rain. The &s;howers being very copious, we &s;aved a con&s;iderable quantity of water; and,

as we could procure a greater &s;upply in one hour, by the rain, than by di&s;tilation in a month, we laid the &s;till a&s;ide, as being attended with more trouble than advantage.</P>
<P>The heat, which had continued in the extreme for about a month, became much more di&s;agree|able in this clo&s;e rainy weather, and we appre|hended it would &s;oon be noxious. It is however, remarkable, that there was not then a &s;ingle per&s;on &s;ick on board either of the &s;hips.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>WE had not long anchored, when two ca|noes paddled towards us, and came along &s;ide without delay or he&s;itation: there were four men in one of the canoes, and three in the other. They brought with them &s;ome &s;ugar-cane, bread-fruit, plaintains, and cocoa-nuts, which they bar|tered with us for nails. After the&s;e canoes had left us, we were vi&s;ited by another; but as night was approaching, he did not long continue with us. The i&s;land neare&s;t to us was Komango, which was five miles di&s;tant, this &s;hews how the&s;e peo|ple di&s;regard trouble or danger, to get po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a few of our mo&s;t trifling articles.</P>
<P>At four o'clock the next morning, Captain Cook di&s;patched Leutenanat King with two boats to Komango, in order to procure refre&s;hments;
<PB N="142" REF="030274_0192_0FE56CBC31DC7B08">
and at five made the &s;ignal to weigh, to proceed to Annamooka.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as day-light apppeared, we were vi&s;ited by &s;ix or &s;even canoes, bringing with them two pigs, &s;ome fowls, &s;everal large wood-pidgeons, &s;mall rails, and &s;ome violet coloured coots, be|&s;ides fruits and roots of various kinds; which they exchanged with us for nails, hatchets, beads, &amp;c. They had other articles of commerce, but Captain Cook gave particular orders that no cu|rio&s;ities &s;hould be purcha&s;ed, till the &s;hips were &s;upplied with provi&s;ions, and till they had obtain|ed permi&s;&s;ion from him.</P>
<P>About noon Mr. King's boat returned with &s;even hogs, &s;ome fowls, a quantity of fruit and roots; and al&s;o &s;ome gra&s;s for our animals. His party was treated with great civility at Komango. The inhabitants did not appear to be numerous: and their huts, which almo&s;t joined to each other, were but indifferent. Tooboulangee, the chief of the i&s;land, and another, named Taipa, came on board with Mr. King. They brought a hog, as a pre&s;ent to Captain Cook, and promi&s;ed to bring &s;ome more the next day.</P>
<P>The boats being a-board, we &s;tood for An|namooka; and, having little wind, we intended to go between Annamooka-ette<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Little Annamooka.</NOTE>, and the breakers at the &s;outh-ea&s;t; but, on drawing near, we met

<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="143" REF="030274_0194_0FE56CBDB956AA48">
with very irregular &s;oundings, which obliged us to relinqui&s;h the de&s;ign, and go to the &s;outh|ward. This carried us to leeward, and we found it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;pend the night under &s;ail. It was dark and rainy, and we had the wind from every direction. The next morning at day-light, we were farther off than we had been the preceding evening; and the wind was now right in our teeth.</P>
<P>We continued to ply, to very little purpo&s;e, the whole day, and, in the evening, anchored in thirty-nine fathoms water; the we&s;t point of Annamooka bearing ea&s;t north-ea&s;t, four miles di&s;tant. Tooboulangee and Taipa, agreeable to their promi&s;e, brought off &s;ome hogs for Cap|tain Cook: we obtained others, by bartering, from the different canoes that followed us, and a large quantity of fruit. It is remarkable, that tho&s;e who vi&s;ited us from the i&s;land on that day, would hardly part with any of their commodities to any one but Captain Cook.</P>
<P>At four the next morning, Captain Cook or|dered a boat to be hoi&s;ted out, and the ma&s;ter to &s;ound the &s;outh-we&s;t &s;ide of Annamooka. When he returned, he reported, that he had founded between Great and Little Annamooka, where he found ten and twelve fathoms depth of water; that the place was very well &s;heltered from winds; but that no fre&s;h water was to be had but at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance inland, and that, even there,
<PB N="144" REF="030274_0195_0FE56CC32AD12A98">
it was neither plentiful nor good. For this very &s;ufficient rea&s;on, Captain Cook re&s;olved to anchor on the north &s;ide of the i&s;land, where, in his la&s;t voyage, he had found a convenient place for water|ing and landing.</P>
<P>Though not above a league di&s;tant, we did not reach it till about five o'clock in the after|noon, being retarded by the quantity of canoes that crowded round the &s;hips, laden with abun|dant &s;upplies of the produce of their i&s;land. Several of the canoes, which were double, had a large &s;ail, and carried between forty and fifty men each. Several women too appeared in the canoes, incited, perhaps, by curio&s;ity to vi&s;it us; though they were as earne&s;t in bartering as the men, and u&s;ed the paddle with equal &s;kill and dexterity. We came to an anchor in eighteen fathoms water, the i&s;land extending from ea&s;t to &s;outh-we&s;t, about three quarters of a mile di&s;|tant. Thus Captain Cook re&s;umed the &s;tation, which he had occupied when he vi&s;ited Anna|mooka three years before; and probably where Ta&s;man, who fir&s;t di&s;covered this i&s;land, anchored in 1643.</P>
<P>The next day, during the preparations for wa|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ering, Captain Cook went a&s;hore, in the fore|noon, accompanied by Captain Clerke, and others, to fix on a place for &s;etting up the ob&s;er|vatories, the natives having readily granted us permi&s;&s;ion. They &s;hewed us every mark of ci|vility,
<PB N="145" REF="030274_0196_0FE56CC4CCFEC458">
and accommodated us with a boat-hou&s;e, which an&s;wered the purpo&s;e of a tent. Toobou, the chief of the i&s;land, conducted Captain Cook and Omai to his hou&s;e, &s;ituated on a plea&s;ant &s;pot, in the centre of his plantation. It was &s;ur|rounded with a gra&s;s-plot, which he &s;aid was for the purpo&s;e of cleaning their feet, before they entered his habitation. Such an attention to cleanline&s;s we had never ob&s;erved before, where|ever we had vi&s;ited in this ocean; though we af|terwards found it to be very common at the Friendly I&s;lands. No carpet in an Engli&s;h draw|ing-room could be kept neater, than the mats which covered the floor of Toobou's hou&s;e.</P>
<P>While we were on &s;hore, we bartered for &s;ome hogs and fruit; and, when we arrived on board, the &s;hips were crowded with the natives. As ve|ry few of them came empty-handed, we were &s;pee|dily &s;upplied with every refre&s;hment.</P>
<P>In the afternoon, Captain Cook landed again, with a party of marines, and &s;uch of the cattle as were in a weakly &s;tate, were &s;ent on &s;hore with him. Having &s;ettled every thing to his &s;a|ti&s;faction, he returned to the &s;hip in the evening, leaving Mr. King in command upon the i&s;land. Taipa was now become our tru&s;ty friend, and, in order to be near our party, had a hou&s;e carried a quarter of a mile, upon men's &s;houlders, and placed by the &s;ide of the &s;hed which our party oc|cupied.</P>
<P><PB N="146" REF="030274_0197_0FE56CC65525F0C0">Our various operations on &s;hore began the next day. Some were bu&s;ied in making hay, others in filling our water-ca&s;ks, and a third party in cutting wood. On the &s;ame day, Me&s;&s;rs. King and Baily began to ob&s;erve equal altitudes of the &s;un, in order to get the rate of our time-keepers. In the evening, Taipa harangued the natives, for &s;ome time; but we could only gue&s;s at the &s;ub|ject, and &s;uppo&s;ed he was in&s;tructing them how to treat us, and advi&s;ing them to bring of the pro|duce of the i&s;land to market. His eloquence had the de&s;ired effect, and occa&s;ioned us to re|ceive a plentiful &s;upply of provi&s;ions the next day.</P>
<P>On the 4th of May, the Di&s;covery lo&s;t her &s;mall bower anchor, the cable being cut in two by the rocks.</P>
<P>We were vi&s;ited, on the 6th, by a chief from Tongataboo, who&s;e name was Feenou: he was introduced by Taipa, as King of all the Friendly I&s;les. Captain Cook was now informed, that, on our arrival, a canoe had been immediately di&s;patched to Tongataboo with the news; which occa&s;ioned his coming to Annamooka. We were informed, by the officer on &s;hore, that, on his arrival, all the natives were ordered out to meet him, who &s;aluted him by bowing their heads as low as his feet, the &s;oles of which they touched with the palms of each hand, and afterwards with the back part. A per&s;onage received with &s;uch
<PB N="147" REF="030274_0198_0FE56CC82993B128">
extraordinary marks of re&s;pect, could not be &s;up|po&s;ed to be any thing le&s;s than a King.</P>
<P>Captain Cook in the afternoon, went to pay a vi&s;it to this great man, having fir&s;t received from him a pre&s;ent of two fi&s;h, brought on board by one of his attendants. As &s;oon as the Cap|tain landed, Feenou came up to him. He was tall and thin, and appeared to be about thirty years of age: his features were more of the Euro|pean ca&s;t than any we had &s;een here. After the fir&s;t &s;alutation, Captain Cook reque&s;ted to know if he was king; as he entertained &s;ome doubts on that &s;core, perceiving that he was not the man whom he remembered to have &s;een in that character during his former voyage. Taipa ea|gerly an&s;wered for him, and mentioned no le&s;s than one hundred and fifty three i&s;lands, of which he was the &s;overeign. Soon after, our grand vi|&s;itor, attended by five or &s;ix &s;ervants, accom|panied us on board. Captain Cook made them &s;uitable pre&s;ents, and entertained them in a man|ner which he thought would be mo&s;t agreeably to them.</P>
<P>Towards the evening, the Captain attended them on &s;hore in his boat, into which, by order of the chief, three hogs were conveyed, as a re|turn for pre&s;ents he had received. We were then informed of an accident, the relation of which will convey &s;ome idea of the extent of the authority exerci&s;ed here over the inferior people.
<PB N="148" REF="030274_0199_0FE56CCD350793A8">
While Feenou was on board the Re&s;olution, an inferior chief ordered all the natives to retire from the po&s;t we occupied. Some of them, how|ever, having ventured to return, he beat them mo&s;t unmercifully, with a large &s;tick. One, in particular, received &s;o violent a blow on the &s;ide of the face, that the blood gu&s;hed from his mouth and no&s;trils: and, after lying motionle&s;s for &s;ome time, he was removed from the place in convul&s;ions. The per&s;on who gave the blow, on being told that he certainly had killed the man, only laughed at the circum&s;tance; and, in|deed, it was very evident, that he did not grieve for what had happened. We had afterwards the &s;atisfaction of hearing that the poor &s;ufferer was out of danger.</P>
<P>On the 7th, the Di&s;covery having found her &s;mall bower anchor, &s;hifted her birth; but not till after her be&s;t bower cable had met with the fate of the other. This day, Feenou dined with Captain Cook; and al&s;o on the next, when he was attended by Taipa, Toobou, and &s;ome other chiefs. None but Taipa, however was permit|ted to &s;it at table with Feeuou, or even to eat in his pre&s;ence. The Captain was highly plea&s;ed on account of this etiquette; for before the ar|rival of Feenou, he had generally a larger com|pany than he cho&s;e, his table being overflowed with vi&s;itors of both &s;exes. For though, at Ota|heite, the females are denied the privilege of eat|ing
<PB N="149" REF="030274_0200_0FE56CCEBB879BD8">
in company with the men, this is not the prac|tice at the Friendly I&s;lands.</P>
<P>A large junk axe having been &s;tolen out of the &s;hip by one of the natives on the fir&s;t day of our arrival at Annamooka, application was made to Feenou to exert his authority to get it re&s;tored; who gave orders for this purpo&s;e, which exacted &s;uch implicit obedience, that it was brought on board before we had fini&s;hed our dinner. We had, indeed, many opportunities of remarking, how expert the&s;e people were in thievery. Even &s;ome of their chiefs were not a&s;hamed of acting in that profe&s;&s;ion. On the 9th of May, one of them was detected carrying out of the &s;hip, the bolt belonging to the &s;pun-yarn winch, which he had carefully concealed under his clothes. For this offence Captain Cook &s;entenced him to re|ceive a dozen la&s;hes, and to be confined till he paid a hog for his liberty. Though, after this circum&s;tance, we were troubled with no more thieves of rank, their &s;ervants or &s;laves were con&s;tantly employed in this dirty bu&s;ine&s;s; and they received a flogging with as much &s;eeming indifference, as if it had been upon the main|ma&s;t. When any of them were caught in the act of thieving, in&s;tead of interceding in their behalf, their ma&s;ters would often advi&s;e us to kill them. This being a puni&s;hment we were not fond of inflicting, they u&s;ually e&s;caped without any kind of puni&s;hment; they were alike in&s;en|&s;ible
<PB N="150" REF="030274_0201_0FE56CD04A3B2FB8">
of the &s;hame and torture of corporal cha&s;|ti&s;ement. At length, however, Captain Clerke contrived a mode of treatment, which we &s;up|po&s;ed had &s;ome effect. Immediately upon detec|tion, he ordered their heads to be completely &s;hav|ed, and thus pointed them out as objects of ridi|cule to their countrymen, and put our people upon their guard, to deprive them of future opportunites for a repetition of their thefts.</P>
<P>Feenou was &s;o fond of our company, that he dined on board every day, though he did not al|ways partake of our fare. On the 10th, his &s;er|vants brought him a me&s;s, which had been dre&s;&s;ed on &s;hore, con&s;i&s;ting of fi&s;h, &s;oup, and yams; cocoa-nut liquor had been u&s;ed in&s;tead of water, in which the fi&s;h had been boiled or &s;tewed, (per|haps in a wooden ve&s;&s;el with hot &s;tones) and it was carried on board on a plantain leaf. Captain Cook ta&s;ted of the me&s;s, and was &s;o well plea&s;ed with it, that he afterwards ordered &s;ome fi&s;h to be dre&s;&s;ed in the &s;ame way; though his cook &s;uc|ceeded tolerably well, it was much inferior to the di&s;h he attempted to imitate.</P>
<P>Having, in a great mea&s;ure, exhau&s;ted the i&s;land of almo&s;t every article of food, on Sun|day the 11th of May, we removed, from the &s;hore, the ob&s;ervatories, hor&s;es, and other things that we had landed; intending to &s;ail as &s;oon as the Di&s;covery &s;hould have found her be&s;t bower anchor. Feenou, hearing that the Captain meant to
<PB N="151" REF="030274_0202_0FE56CD21920A1E8">
proceed to Tongataboo, earne&s;tly entreated him to alter his plan; expre&s;&s;ing as much aver&s;ion to it, as if, by diverting him from it, he wi&s;hed to pro|mote &s;ome particular intere&s;t of his own. He warmly recommended a group of i&s;lands, called Hapaee, lying to the north-ea&s;t; where, he a&s;|&s;ured us, we could be ea&s;ily and plentifully &s;up|plied with every refre&s;hment; and even offered to attend us thither in per&s;on. In con&s;equence of his advice, Hapaee was made choice of; and, as it had not been vi&s;ited by any European &s;hips, the &s;urveying it became an object to Captain Cook.</P>
<P>On Tue&s;day the 13th, Captain Clerke's anchor was happily recovered; and, on the morning of the 14th, we got under &s;ail, and left Annamoo|ka.</P>
<P>Though this i&s;land is &s;omewhat higher than the other &s;mall i&s;les that &s;urround it, yet it is lower than Mangeea and Wateeoo; and even tho&s;e are but of a moderate height. The &s;hore, where our &s;hips lay, con&s;i&s;ts of a &s;teep, rugged, coral rock, about nine or ten feet high, except two &s;andy beaches, which were defended from the &s;ea, by a reef of the &s;ame &s;ort of rock. In the centre of the i&s;land there is a &s;alt water lake, about a mile and an half in breadth, round which the ground ri&s;es with a gradual a&s;cent; and we could not trace its having any communica|tion with the &s;ea. On the ri&s;ing parts of the
<PB N="152" REF="030274_0203_0FE56CD58DF27710">
i&s;land, and e&s;pecially towards the &s;ea, the &s;oil is either of a blacki&s;h loo&s;e mould, or a reddi&s;h clay; but there is not a &s;tream of fre&s;h water to be found in any part of the i&s;land.</P>
<P>The land here is well cultivated, except in a few places; and, though &s;ome parts appear to lie wa&s;te, they are only left to recover the &s;trength exhau&s;ted by con&s;tant culture; for we often &s;aw the natives at work upon the&s;e &s;pots, in order to plant them again. Yams and plantains form their principal plantations; many of which are very exten&s;ive, and enclo&s;ed with fences of reed about &s;ix feet high. Fences of le&s;s compa&s;s were often &s;een within the&s;e, &s;urrounding the hou&s;es of the principal people. The bread-fruit and cocoa-nut-trees are inter&s;per&s;ed without any regular or|der, but principally near the habitations of the natives. The other parts of the i&s;land, e&s;pecially towards the &s;ea, and round the lake, are covered with luxuriant trees and bu&s;hes; among which there are a great many mangroves and faitanoo-trees. All the rocks and &s;tones about the i&s;land are of coral, except in one place, to the right of the &s;andy beach, where there is a rock of about twenty five feet in height, of a calcareous &s;tone, and of a yellowi&s;h colour; but, even here, &s;ome large pieces are to be &s;een of the &s;ame coral rock as that which compo&s;e the &s;hore.</P>
<P>We &s;ometimes amu&s;ed our&s;elves in walking up the country and &s;hooting wild ducks, re&s;embling
<PB N="153" REF="030274_0204_0FE56CD765F8D728">
our widgeon, which are very numerous on the &s;alt lake, as well as on the pool where we pro|cured our water. We found, in the&s;e excur&s;ions, that the inhabitants frequently de&s;erted their hou&s;es to repair to the trading place, without en|tertaining the lea&s;t &s;u&s;picion that &s;trangers would take away or de&s;troy any property that belonged to them. From this circum&s;tance it might be &s;uppo&s;ed, that mo&s;t of the natives were &s;ome|times collected on the beach, and that there would be no great difficulty in forming an accu|rate computation of their number; but the conti|nual re&s;ort of vi&s;itors, from the other i&s;lands, ren|dered it impo&s;&s;ible. However, as we never &s;aw more than a thou&s;and per&s;ons collected at one time, it may be rea&s;onably &s;uppo&s;ed, that there are about twice that number upon the i&s;land.</P>
<P>In the direct track to Hapaee, whither we were now bound, to the north and north-ea&s;t of Annamooka, a great number of &s;mall i&s;les are &s;een. Amid&s;t the rocks and &s;hoals adjoining to this group, we were doubtful whether there was a free pa&s;&s;age for &s;hips of &s;uch magnitude as ours; though the natives &s;ailed through the intervals in their canoes; therefore, when we weighed an|chor from Annamooka, we &s;teered to go to the we&s;tward of the above i&s;lands, and north north-we&s;t towards Kao, and Too&s;oa, two i&s;lands re|markable for their great height, and the mo&s;t we&s;terly of tho&s;e in &s;ight. Feenou, with his at|tendants,
<PB N="154" REF="030274_0205_0FE56CD8F1FF7FE0">
remained in the Re&s;olution till about noon, and then entered the large &s;ailing canoe, which had brought him from Tongataboo, and &s;tood in among&s;t the clu&s;ter of i&s;lands, of which we were now abrea&s;t.</P>
<P>They are &s;cattered at unequal di&s;tances, and mo&s;t of them are as high as Annamooka. Some of them are two or three miles in length, and others only half a mile. Many of them have &s;teep rocky &s;hores, like Annamooka; &s;ome have reddi&s;h cliffs, and others have &s;andy beaches, extending almo&s;t their whole length. In general, they are entirely clothed with trees, among which are many cocoa-palms, each having the appearance of a beautiful garden placed in the &s;ea. The &s;erene weather we now had, contri|buted greatly to heighten the &s;cene; and the whole might convey an idea of the realization of &s;ome fairy land. It appears, that &s;ome of the&s;e i&s;lands have been formed, as Palmer&s;ton's i&s;land was &s;uppo&s;ed to have been; for one of them is now entirely &s;and, and another has but a &s;ingle bu&s;h or tree upon it.</P>
<P>In the afternoon, about four o'clock, we &s;teered to the north, leaving Toofoa and Kao on our lar|board. We intended to have anchored for the night, but it arrived before we could find a place, in le&s;s than fifty fathoms water; and we rather cho&s;e to &s;pend the night under &s;ail, than come to in &s;uch a depth.</P>
<P><PB N="155" REF="030274_0206_0FE56C63927D3B08">In the afternoon, we had been within two leagues of Toofoa, and ob&s;erved the &s;moke of it &s;everal times in the day. There is a volcano upon it, of which the Friendly i&s;landers entertain &s;ome &s;uper&s;titious notions, and call it <HI>Kollofeea,</HI> &s;aying, it is an Otooa, or divinity. We were informed, that it &s;ometimes throws up very large &s;tones, and the <HI>crater</HI> is compared to the &s;ize of a &s;mall i&s;lot, which has not cea&s;ed &s;mok|ing in the memory of the inhabitants; nor have they any traditions that it ever did. We &s;ome|times &s;aw the &s;moke from the centre of the i&s;land, even at Annamooka, the di&s;tance of at lea&s;t ten leagues. We were told that Toofoa was but thin|ly inhabited, but that the water upon it was excel|lent.</P>
<P>At day-break, on the 15th, we were not far from Kao, which is a large rock of a conic figure; we &s;teered to the pa&s;&s;age between Footooha and Hafaiva, with a gentle breeze at &s;outh-ea&s;t. About ten o'clock, Feenou came on board, and con|tinued with us all day. He brought with him a quantity of fruit and two hogs; and, in the cour&s;e of the day, &s;everal canoes came to barter quantities of the former article, which was very acceptable to us, as our &s;tock began to be low. At noon, our latitude was 19&deg; 49&prime; 45&Prime; &s;outh, and we had made &s;even miles of longitude from Anna|mooka.</P>

Having pa&s;&s;ed this reef, we hauled up for Neeneeva, a &s;mall low i&s;le in the direction of ea&s;t-north-ea&s;t from Footooha, in hopes of finding an anchorage, but were again di&s;appointed; for notwith&s;tanding we had land in every direction, the &s;ea was unfathomable.

<P>At day-break on the 16th, we &s;teered with a gentle breeze at &s;outh-ea&s;t, for Hapaee, which was now in &s;ight; and perceived it to be low land, from the trees only appearing above the water. At nine o'clock we &s;aw it plainly forming three i&s;lands nearly equal in &s;ize; and, &s;oon after, a fourth ap|peared to the &s;outhward of the&s;e, as large as any of the others. Each of the&s;e i&s;lands ap|peared to be of a &s;imilar height and appearance, and about &s;ix or &s;even miles in length. The mo&s;t northern of them is called Haanno, the next Foa, the third Lefooga, and the fourth Hoolaiva; but they are all four included under the general name of Hapaee.</P>
<P>By &s;un-&s;et, we got up with the nothernmo&s;t of the&s;e i&s;les, where we experienced the &s;ame di&s;|tre&s;s for want of anchorage, that we did the two preceding evenings; having another night to &s;pend under &s;ail, with land and breakers in

every direction. Feenou, who had been on board all day, went forward to Hapaee in the evening, and took Omai with him in the canoe. He was not unmindful of our di&s;agreeable &s;ituation, and kept up a good fire the whole night, by way of a land-mark.</P>
<P>At the return of day-light, on the 17th, be|ing then clo&s;e in with Foa, we perceived it was joined to Haanno, by a reef running from one I&s;land to the other, even with the &s;urface of the &s;ea. Captain Cook di&s;patched a boat to look for anchorage; and a proper place was found abrea&s;t of a reef which joins Lefooga or Foa, having twenty-four fathoms depth of water. In this &s;tation the nothern point of Hapaee bore north, 16&deg; ea&s;t. We were not above three quar|ters of a mile from the &s;hore; and, as we lay before a creek in the reef, it was convenient landing at all times.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>AS &s;oon as we had anchored, we were &s;ur|rounded by a multitude of canoes, and our &s;hips were pre&s;ently filled with the natives. They brought with them hogs, fowls, fruit, and roots, which they exchanged for cloath, knives, beads, nails, and hatchets. Feenou and Omai having come on board, early the next morning, in order to introduce Captain Cook to the people of the i&s;land, he &s;oon accompanied them on &s;hore for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>The Chief conducted the Captain to a hut, &s;ituated clo&s;e to the &s;ea-beach, which was brought thither but a few minutes before for his recep|tion. In this Feenou, Omai, and Captain Cook, were &s;eated. The other chiefs, and the multi|tude, appeared fronting them on the out&s;ide; and they al&s;o &s;eated them&s;elves. Captain Cook be|ing a&s;ked how long he intended to &s;tay, an&s;wered
<PB N="159" REF="030274_0210_0FE56CE18FA75AD0">
five days. Taipa was, therefore, ordered to &s;it by him, and declare this to the people. He then harangued them in words nearly to the fol|lowing purport, as we afterwards were informed by Omai. He exhorted both old and young, to look upon Captain Cook as a friend, who meant to continue with them a few days; and that, during his &s;tay among them, they would not &s;teal any thing from him or offend him in any other manner. He informed them, that it was expected they &s;hould bring hogs, fowls, fruit, &amp;c. to the &s;hips; for which they would receive in exchange, &s;uch articles as he enumerated. Soon after Taipa had delivered his addre&s;s to the a&s;&s;embly, Feenou left them; on which Captain Cook was informed by Taipa, that it was nece&s;|&s;ary he &s;hould make a pre&s;ent to Earoupa, the chief of the i&s;land. The Captain being not unpre|pared for this gave him &s;uch articles as far ex|ceeded his expectation. This liberality created &s;imilar demands from two chiefs of other i&s;les who were pre&s;ent, and even from Taipa him&s;elf. Soon after he had made the la&s;t of the&s;e pre&s;ents, Feenou returned, and expre&s;&s;ed his di&s;plea&s;ure with Taipa for &s;uffering me to be &s;o lavi&s;h of my favours. But this was, doubtle&s;s, a fine&s;&s;e, as he certainly acted in concert with the others.</P>
<P>Feenou now re&s;umed his &s;eat, ordering Earoupa to &s;it by him, and harangue the people as Taipa
<PB N="160" REF="030274_0211_0FE56CE3495841F8">
had done, which he did nearly to the &s;ame pur|po&s;e.</P>
<P>The&s;e ceremonies over, the Chief, at the Cap|tain's reque&s;t, conducted him to three &s;tagnant pools of what he called fre&s;h water; in one of which the water was indeed tolerable, and the &s;ituation convenient for filling our ca&s;ks. On his return to his former &s;tation, he found a baked hog and &s;ome yams, &s;moaking hot, ready to be conveyed on board for his dinner. He invited Feenou and his friends to partake of the repa&s;t, and they embarked for the &s;hip, though none but him&s;elf &s;at down with us at table. Dinner being over, the Captain conducted them on &s;hore; and, before he returned, received, as a pre&s;ent from the chief, a fine large turtle, and a quantity of yams. We had a plentiful &s;upply of provi&s;ions, for in the cour&s;e of the day we got, by bartering with the natives, about twenty &s;mall hogs, together with a large quantity of fruit and roots.</P>
<P>On Sunday the 18th, early in the morning, Feenou and Omai, who now &s;lept on &s;hore with the Chief, came on board, to reque&s;t Captain Cook's pre&s;ence upon the i&s;land. He accompa|nied them, and, upon landing, was conducted to the place where he had been &s;eated the pre|ceding day, and where he beheld a large con|cour&s;e of people already a&s;&s;embled. Though he imagined that &s;omething extraordinary was in

agitation, yet he could not conjecture what, nor could Omai give him any information.</P>
<P>Soon after he was &s;eated, about an hundred of the natives appeared and advanced, laden with yams, plantains, bread-fruit, cocoa-nuts, and &s;ugar-canes; their burdens were depo&s;ited on our left. A number of others arrived &s;oon after, bearing the &s;ame kind of articles, which were collected into two piles on the right &s;ide. To the&s;e were fa&s;tened two pigs, and half a dozen fowls; and to tho&s;e upon the left, &s;ix pigs and two turtles. Earoupa &s;eated him&s;elf before the articles on the left &s;ide, and another chief before tho&s;e upon the right; they being, it was &s;up|po&s;ed, the two chiefs who had procured them by order of Feenou, who was as implicitly obeyed here, as he had been at Annamooka, and who had probably laid this tax upon the chiefs of Hapaee for the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>When this munificent collection of provi&s;ions was placed in order and advantageou&s;ly di&s;po&s;ed, the bearers of it joined the multitude, who form|ed a circle round the whole. Immediately after, a number of men, armed with clubs, entered this circle, or area; where they paraded about for a few minutes and then one half of them re|tired to one &s;ide, and the other half to the other &s;ide, &s;eating them&s;elves before the &s;pectators. Pre&s;ently after, they &s;ucce&s;&s;ively entertained us with &s;ingle combats; one champion from one
<PB N="162" REF="030274_0214_0FE56CEB1B432810">
&s;ide challenging tho&s;e of the other &s;ide, partly by words but more by expre&s;&s;ive ge&s;tures, to &s;end one of their party to oppo&s;e him. The challenge was, in general, accepted; the two combatants placed them&s;elves in proper attitudes, and the engagement began, which continued till one of them yielded, or till their weapons were broken. At the conclu&s;ion of each combat, the victor &s;quatted him&s;elf down before the chief, then im|mediately ro&s;e up and retired. Some old men who &s;eemed to pre&s;ide as judges, gave their plau|dit in a very few words; and the multitude, e&s;|pecially tho&s;e on the &s;ide of the conqueror, cele|brated the glory he had acquired in two or three loud huzzas.</P>
<P>This entertainment was &s;ometimes &s;u&s;pended for a &s;hort &s;pace, and the intervals of time were filled up with wre&s;tling and boxing-matches. The fir&s;t were performed in the method practi&s;ed at Otaheite, and the &s;econd differed very little from the Engli&s;h manner. A couple of &s;tout wenches next &s;teped forth, and without cere|mony, began boxing with as much dexterity as the men. This conte&s;t, however, was but of &s;hort duration, for in the &s;pace of half a minute, one of them gave it up. The victorious heroine was applauded by the &s;pectators, in the &s;ame man|ner as the &s;ucce&s;sful combatants of the other &s;ex. Though we expre&s;&s;ed &s;ome di&s;approbation at this part of the entertainment, it did not hinder two

other females from entering the li&s;ts; who &s;eemed to be &s;pirited girls, and, if two old women had not interpo&s;ed to part them, would probably have given each other a good drubbing. At lea&s;t three thou&s;and &s;pectators were pre&s;ent when the&s;e com|bats were exhibited, and every thing was conduct|ed with the mo&s;t perfect good humour on all &s;ides; though &s;ome of the champions, of both &s;exes, re|ceived blows which they mu&s;t have felt the effect of for &s;ome time after.</P>
<P>The diver&s;ions being fini&s;hed, the chief in|formed Captain Cook that the provi&s;ions on our right hand were a pre&s;ent to Omai; and that tho&s;e on our left (making about two-thirds of the whole quantity) were intended for him, and that he might &s;uit his own convenience in taking them on board.</P>
<P>Four boats were loaded with the munificence of Feenou, who&s;e favours far exceeded any that Captain Cook had ever received from the &s;ove|reigns of any of the i&s;lands which he had vi&s;ited in the Pacific Ocean. He, therefore, embraced the fir&s;t opportunity of convincing Feenou that he was not in&s;en&s;ible of his liberality, by be&s;towing upon him &s;uch commodities as he &s;uppo&s;ed were mo&s;t valuable in his e&s;timation. Feenou was &s;o highly plea&s;ed with the return that was made him, that he left the Captain &s;till indebted to him by &s;ending him two large hogs, &s;ome yams, and a con&s;iderable quantity of cloth.</P>
<P><PB N="164" REF="030274_0217_0FE56CEE76273478">Feenou having expre&s;&s;ed a de&s;ire to &s;ee the ma|rines perform their exerci&s;e, Captain Cook or|dered them all a&s;hore on the morning of the 20th of May. After they had gone through various evolutions, and fired &s;everal vollies; which &s;eemed to give plea&s;ure to our numerous &s;pectators, the chief, in his turn, entertained us with an exhibi|tion, which was performed with an exactne&s;s and dexterity, far &s;urpa&s;&s;ing what they had &s;een of our military manoeuvres. It was a kind of dance, performed by men, in which one hundred and five per&s;ons were engaged; each having an in&s;trument in his hand, re&s;embling a paddle, two feet and an half long, with a thin blade, and a &s;mall handle. With the&s;e in&s;truments various flouri&s;hes were made, each of which was accom|panied with a different movement, or a different attitude of the body. At fir&s;t, the dancers ranged them&s;elves in three lines and &s;o changed their &s;tations by different evolutions, that tho&s;e who had been in the rear came into the front. At one part of the performance, they extended them&s;elves in one line; afterwards they formed them&s;elves into a &s;emi circle; and then into two &s;quare co|lumns. During the la&s;t movement, one of them came forward, and performed an antic dance be|fore Captain Cook, with which the entertainment ended.</P>
<P>The mu&s;ic that accompanied the dances was produced by two drums, or rather hollow logs of
<PB N="165" REF="030274_0218_0FE56C69C9A35C88">
wood, from which they forced &s;ome varied notes by beating on them with two &s;ticks. The dancers, however, did not appear to be much a&s;&s;i&s;ted or directed by the&s;e &s;ounds; but by a chorus of vocal mu&s;ic, in which all the performers joined. Their &s;ong was rather melodious, and their cor|re&s;ponding motions were &s;o &s;kilfully executed, that the whole body of dancers appeared as one regular machine. Such a performance would have been applauded even on an European theatre. It far exceeded any attempt that we had made to entertain them; in&s;omuch that they &s;eemed to plume them&s;elves on their &s;uperiority over us. They e&s;teemed none of our mu&s;ical in&s;truments, except the drum, and even thought that inferior to their own. They held our French horns in the highe&s;t contempt, and would not pay the &s;malle&s;t attention to them, either here or at any other of the i&s;lands.</P>
<P>To give them a more favourable opinion of the amu&s;ements and &s;uperior attainments of the Engli&s;h, Captain Cook ordered &s;ome fire-works to be pre|pared; and, after it was dark exhibited them in the pre&s;ence of Feenou, and a va&s;t multitude of people. They were highly entertained with the performance in general: but our water and &s;ky|rockets, in particular, a&s;toni&s;hed them beyond all conception. They now admitted that the &s;cale was turned in our favour.</P>
<P><PB N="166" REF="030274_0219_0FE56CF08B2B6000">This, however, &s;erved only as an additional &s;timulus to urge them to proceed to fre&s;h exer|tions of their &s;ingular dexterity. As &s;oon as our fire-works were ended, a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of dances, which Feenou had prepared for our entertainment, began.</P>
<P>A band of mu&s;ic, or chorus con&s;i&s;ting of eighteen men, &s;eated them&s;elves before us, in the centre of a circle formed by the numerous &s;pectators. About four or five of the performers had each pieces of large bamboo, from three to &s;ix feet in length, each played on by one man, who held it almo&s;t vertically; the upper end of which was open, but the other clo&s;ed by one of the joints. They kept con&s;tantly &s;triking the ground, though &s;lowly, with the clo&s;e end, and thus produced variety of notes, according to the different lengths of the in&s;truments, but all were of the ba&s;e or hollow kind; which was counteracted by a per&s;on who &s;truck nimbly a piece of the &s;ame &s;ub&s;tance, &s;plit and lying upon the ground; furni&s;hing a tone as acute, as the others were grave and &s;o|lemn. The whole of the band (including tho&s;e who performed upon the bamboos) &s;ung a &s;low &s;oft air, which &s;o finely tempered the har&s;her notes of the in&s;truments, that the mo&s;t perfect judge of the modulation of &s;weet &s;ounds could not avoid confe&s;&s;ing the va&s;t power, and plea&s;ing effect of this &s;imple harmony.</P>
<P>About a quarter of an hour after the concert began, twenty women entered the circle, who&s;e

heads were adorned with garlands of crim&s;on-flowers; and many of their per&s;ons were deco|rated with leaves of trees, curiou&s;ly &s;colloped, and ornamented at the edges. They encircled tho&s;e of the chorus, with their faces towards them, and began by &s;inging a &s;oft air, to which re&s;pon&s;es were made by the chorus; and tho&s;e were alternately repeated. The women accom|panied their &s;ong with many graceful motions of their hands, and continually advancing and re|treating with one foot, while the other remained fixed. After this, they turned their faces to the a&s;&s;embly, and having &s;ung &s;ome time, retreated &s;lowly in a body, and placed them&s;elves oppo&s;ite the hut, where the principal &s;pectators &s;at. One of them next, advanced from each &s;ide, pa&s;&s;ing each other in the front, and progre&s;&s;ively moving till they came to the re&s;t. On which two advanc|ed from each &s;ide, two of whom returned, but the other two remained; and to the&s;e, from each &s;ide, came on by intervals, till they all had, once more, formed a circle about the chorus.</P>
<P>Dancing to a quicker mea&s;ure now &s;ucceeded, in which the performers made a kind of half-turn by leaping; then clapping their hands, and &s;nap|ping their fingers, repeated &s;ome words in uni&s;on with the chorus. As they proceeded in the dance, the rapidity of their mu&s;ic increa&s;ed; their ge&s;|tures and attitudes were varied with wonderful dexterity; and &s;ome of their motions would, by
<PB N="168" REF="030274_0222_0FE56C004B93DA18">
an European, be thought rather indecent; though, perhaps, they meant only to di&s;play the a&s;toni&s;h|ing variety of their movements.</P>
<P>This female ballet was &s;ucceeded by one per|formed by fifteen men; and, though &s;ome of them were old, time &s;eemed to have robbed them of but little of their agility. They were di&s;po&s;ed in a &s;ort of circle, divided at the front. Some|times they &s;ung &s;lowly in concert with the chorus, making &s;everal graceful motions with their hands but differing from tho&s;e of the women; at the &s;ame time inclining the body alternately to either &s;ide, by rai&s;ing one leg outward, and re&s;ting on the other; the arm of the &s;ame &s;ide being al&s;o &s;tretched upward. Then they recited &s;entences, which were an&s;wered by the chorus; and occa|&s;ionally increa&s;ed the mea&s;ure of the dance, by clapping the hands, and quickening the motions of the feet. Towards the conclu&s;ion, the rapidity of the mu&s;ic and dancing &s;o much increa&s;ed, that the different movements were hard to be di&s;tin|gui&s;hed.</P>
<P>This dance being ended, after a con&s;iderable interval, twelve other men advanced, placing them&s;elves in double rows, fronting each other. On one &s;ide was &s;tationed a kind of prompter, who repeated &s;everal &s;entences, to which re&s;pon&s;es were made by the performers and the chorus. They &s;ung and danced &s;lowly; and gradually grew quicker, like tho&s;e whom they had &s;ucceeded.</P>
<P><PB N="169" REF="030274_0223_0FE56C07E78756C8">The next who exhibited them&s;elves were nine women, who &s;at down oppo&s;ite the hut where the chief had placed him&s;elf. A man immediately ro&s;e, and gave the fir&s;t of the&s;e women a blow on the back with both his fi&s;ts joined. He treated the &s;econd and third in the &s;ame manner; but when he came to the fourth, he &s;truck her upon the brea&s;t. Upon &s;eeing this, a per&s;on in&s;tantly ri&s;ing up from among the crowd, knocked him down with a blow on the head, and he was quiet|ly carried away. But this did not excu&s;e the other five women from &s;o extraordinary a di&s;cipline; for they were treated in the &s;ame manner by a per&s;on who &s;ucceeded him. When the&s;e nine women danced, their performance was twice di&s;|approved of, and they were obliged to repeat it again. There was no great difference between this dance and that of the fir&s;t women, except that the&s;e &s;ometimes rai&s;ed the body upon one leg, and then upon the other, alternately, by a &s;ort of double motion.</P>
<P>Soon after a per&s;on unexpectedly entered, making &s;ome ludicrous remarks on the fire-works that had been exhibited, which extorted a bur&s;t of laughter from the crowd. We had then a dance by the attendants of Feenou: they formed a double circle of twenty-four each round the chorus, and joined in a gentle &s;oothing &s;ong, accompanied with motions of the head and hands. They al&s;o began with &s;low movements, which
<PB N="170" REF="030274_0224_0FE56C09A9462598">
gradually became more and more rapid, and finally clo&s;ed with &s;everal very ingenious tran&s;po&s;i|tions of the two circles.</P>
<P>The fe&s;tivity of this memorable night con|cluded with a dance, in which the principal peo|ple a&s;&s;i&s;ted. In many re&s;pects it re&s;embled the preceding ones, but they increa&s;ed their motions to a prodigious quickne&s;s, &s;haking their heads from &s;houlder to &s;houlder, in&s;omuch that they appeared in danger of di&s;locating their necks. This was at|tended with a clapping of the hands, and a kind of &s;avage holla! or &s;hriek. A per&s;on on one &s;ide, repeated &s;omething in a truly mu&s;ical recitative, and with an air &s;o graceful, as might put &s;ome of our applauded performers to the blu&s;h. He was an&s;wered by another, and this was repeated &s;everal times by the whole body on each &s;ide; and they fini&s;hed, by &s;inging and dancing, as they had begun.</P>
<P>The two la&s;t dances were univer&s;ally approved by all the &s;pectators. They were perfectly in time, and &s;ome of their ge&s;tures were &s;o expre&s;&s;ive, that it might ju&s;tly be &s;aid, they &s;poke the language that accompanied them.</P>
<P>The theatre for the&s;e performances was an open &s;pace among the trees, bordering on the &s;ea, with lights, placed at &s;mall intervals, round the in&s;ide of the circle. Though the concour&s;e of people was pretty large, their number was much inferior to that a&s;&s;embled in the forenoon, when the ma|rines performed their exerci&s;e. At that time

<P>THE next day, which was the 21&s;t of May, Captain Cook made an excur&s;ion into the I&s;land of Lefooga, on foot, which he found to be, in &s;ome re&s;pects, &s;uperior to Annamooka, the plantations being not only more numerous, but al&s;o more exten&s;ive. Many parts of the country, near

the &s;ea, are &s;till wa&s;te; owing perhaps to the &s;andine&s;s of the &s;oil. But, in the internal parts of the i&s;land, the &s;oil is better; and the marks of con&s;iderable population, and of an improved &s;tate of cultivation, are very con&s;picuous. Many of the plantations are inclo&s;ed in &s;uch a manner, that the fences, running parallel to each other, form &s;pacious public roads. Large &s;pots covered with the paper mulberry-trees, were ob&s;erved; and the plantations in general, were abundantly &s;tocked with &s;uch plants and fruit-trees as the i&s;land produces. To the&s;e the Commodore made &s;ome addition, by &s;owing the &s;eeds of melons, pump|kins, Indian corn, &amp;c. At one place was a hou&s;e, about four times as large as the ordinary ones, with an exten&s;ive area of gra&s;s before it, to which the people probably re&s;ort on &s;ome public occa|&s;ions. Near the landing place we ob&s;erved a mount two or three feet high, on which &s;tood four or five little huts, wherein the bodies of &s;ome per&s;ons of di&s;tinction had been in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">erred. The i&s;land is but &s;even miles in length; and its breadth, in &s;ome places, is not above three miles. The ea&s;t-&s;ide has a reef, projecting con&s;iderably, again&s;t which the &s;ea breaks with great violence. It is a continuation of this reef that joins Le|fooga to Foa, which is but half a mile di&s;tant; and, at low water, the natives can walk upon this reef from one i&s;land to the other. The &s;hore is either a &s;andy beach, or a coral rock.</P>
<P><PB N="173" REF="030274_0228_0FE56C1212A577D0">When the Captain returned from his excur|&s;ion, and went on board, he found a large &s;ailing canoe fa&s;tened to the &s;tern of the Re&s;olution. In this canoe was Latooliboula, whom the Com|modore had &s;een, during his la&s;t voyage, at Ton|gataboo, and who was then &s;uppo&s;ed by him to be the king of that i&s;land<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In Captain Cook's narrative of that voyage the name of this chief is &s;aid to be <HI>Kohagee-too Fallangou,</HI> which is total|ly different from <HI>Latooliboula.</HI> This may perhaps be accounted for by &s;uppo&s;ing one to be the name of the per&s;on, and the other the de&s;cription of his rank or title.</NOTE>. He could not be prevailed upon to come on board, but continued &s;itting in his canoe with an air of uncommon gravity. The i&s;landers call him <HI>Areekee,</HI> which &s;ignif<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">es King; a title which we had not heard any of them give to Feenou, however exten&s;ive his authority over them had appeared to be. La|tooliboula remained under the &s;tern till the even|ing, and then departed. Feenou was on board the Re&s;olution at that time; but neither of the&s;e chiefs took the &s;malle&s;t notice of the other.</P>
<P>The next day, &s;ome of the natives &s;tealing a tarpaulin and other things, Captain Cook applied to Feenou, de&s;iring him to exert his authority, for the purpo&s;e of getting them re&s;tored; but this application was of no effect. On the 23d, as we were preparing to leave the I&s;land, Feenou and his prime-mini&s;ter Taipa came along-&s;ide in a ca|noe, and informed us that they were going to
<PB N="174" REF="030274_0229_0FE56C14F98E0240">
Vavaoo: an i&s;land &s;ituate, as they &s;aid, about two days &s;ail to the northward of Hapaee. They a&s;|&s;ured us, that the object of their voyage was to procure for us an additional &s;upply of hogs, be|&s;ides &s;ome red-feathered caps for Omai to carry with him to Otaheite; and de&s;ired us not to &s;ail till their return, which would be in four or five days; after which Feenou would accompany us to Tongataboo. Captain Cook con&s;ented to wait the return of this chief, who immediately &s;et out for Vavaoo. On the 24th, a report was indu&s;|triou&s;ly &s;pread about by &s;ome of the i&s;landers, that a &s;hip re&s;embling ours had arrived at An|namooka &s;ince we left it, and was now at anchor there. It was al&s;o reported, that Toobou, the chief of that i&s;land, was ha&s;tening thither to re|ceive the&s;e new vi&s;itors. After enquiry, how|ever, it appeared, that this report was totally void of foundation. It is difficult to conjecture, what purpo&s;e the invention of this tale could an&s;wer; unle&s;s we &s;uppo&s;e it was contrived with a view of getting us removed from one i&s;land to the other.</P>
<P>On Sunday the 25th, Captain Cook went into a hou&s;e where a woman was dre&s;&s;ing the eyes of a child, who &s;eemed blind. The in&s;truments u&s;ed by this female oculi&s;t were two &s;lender wooden probes, with which &s;he bru&s;hed the eyes &s;o as to make them bleed. In the &s;ame hou&s;e he found another woman &s;having a child's head with a
<PB N="175" REF="030274_0230_0FE56C1683FDE190">
&s;hark's tooth, &s;tuck into the end of a &s;tick: &s;he fir&s;t wetted the hair with a rag dipped in water, and then making u&s;e of her in&s;trument, took off the hair as clo&s;e as if a razor had been employed. Captain Cook &s;oon after tried upon him&s;elf one of the&s;e remarkable in&s;truments, which he found to be an excellent &s;ub&s;titute. The natives of the&s;e i&s;lands however, have a different method of &s;having their beards, which operation they perform with two &s;hells; one of which they place under a part of the beard, and with the other, ap|plied above, they &s;crape off that part: in this manner they can &s;have very clo&s;e, though the proce&s;s is rather tedious. There are among them &s;ome men who &s;eem to profe&s;s this trade: for it was as common for our &s;ailors to go a&s;hore to have their beards &s;craped off after the mode of Hapaee, as it was for their two chiefs to come on board to be &s;haved by our barbers.</P>
<P>Captain Cook finding that little or nothing of what the i&s;land produced was now brought to the &s;hips, determined to change his &s;tation, and to wait Feenou's return in &s;ome other anchoring-place, where we might &s;till meet with refre&s;h|ments. We accordingly, on the 26th, made &s;ail to the &s;outhward along the reef of the i&s;land, and having pa&s;&s;ed &s;everal &s;hoals, hauled into a bay, that lies between the north end of Hoolaiva, and the &s;outh of Lefooga, and there anchored. We had no &s;ooner ca&s;t anchor, than Mr. Bligh, Ma&s;|ter
<PB N="176" REF="030274_0231_0FE56C1856389170">
of the Re&s;olution, was &s;ent to &s;ound the bay where we were now &s;tationed; and Captain Cook, accompanied by Lieutenant Gore, landed on the &s;outhern part of Lefooga, to look for fre&s;h water, and examine the country. On the we&s;t &s;ide of the i&s;land, they ob&s;erved an artificial mount of con&s;iderable antiquity, about forty feet high, and mea&s;uring fifty feet in the diameter of its &s;um|mit. At the bo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tom of this mount was a &s;tone fourteen feet high, two and a half thick, and four broad, hewn out of a coral rock; and they were informed by the i&s;landers, that not more than half its length was to be &s;een above ground. They called it <HI>Tangata Areekee</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Tangata,</HI> in the language of the&s;e people, is man; <HI>Aree|kee,</HI> king.</NOTE>; and &s;aid it had been &s;et up, and the mount rai&s;ed, in memory of one of their kings. On the approach of night, the Captain and Mr. Gore returned on board, and Mr. Bligh came back from &s;ounding the bay, in which he found from fourteen to twenty fathoms water with a bottom principally of &s;and.</P>
<P>Lefooga and Hoolaiva are &s;eparated from each other by a reef of coral rocks, dry at low water. Some of our gentlemen, who landed in the la&s;t mentioned i&s;land, found not the &s;malle&s;t mark of cultivation or habitation upon it, except a &s;ingle hut, in which a man employed to catch fi&s;h and turtle re&s;ided. It is remarkable that it &s;hould

remain in this de&s;olate condition, &s;ince it com|municates &s;o immediately with Lefooga, which is &s;o well cultivated. The we&s;t &s;ide of it has a bend|ing, where there &s;eems to be good anchorage; and the ea&s;t &s;ide has a reef, as well as Lefooga. Uninhabited as Hoolaiva is, an artificial mount has been rai&s;ed upon it, equal in height to &s;ome of the &s;urrounding trees.</P>
<P>On Tue&s;day the 27th, at break of day, the Commodore made the &s;ignal to weigh; and as he intended to attempt, in his way to Tonga|taboo, a pa&s;&s;age to Annamooka, by the &s;outh-we&s;t, among the intermediate i&s;les, he &s;ent Mr. Bligh in a boat to &s;ound before the &s;hips. But before we got under &s;ail, the wind became &s;o va|riable and un&s;ettled, as to render it un&s;afe to at|tempt a pa&s;&s;age with which we were &s;o little ac|quainted: we therefore lay fa&s;t, and made &s;ignal for the Ma&s;ter to return. He and the Ma&s;ter of the Di&s;covery were afterwards &s;ent, each in a boat to examine the channels. Towards noon, a large <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ailing canoe came under our &s;tern, in which was a per&s;on named Poulaho, or Futtafaihe, or both; who was &s;aid, by the natives then on board, to be king of Tongataboo, Annamooka, Hapaee, and all the neighbouring i&s;lands. We were &s;urpri&s;ed to find a &s;tranger dignified with this title, which we had been taught to believe appertained to another: but they per&s;i&s;ted in their a&s;&s;ertions, that the &s;upreme dignity belonged to Poulaho; an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="178" REF="030274_0233_0FE56C1F299BEE88">
now for the fir&s;t time acknowledged, that Fee|nou was not the king, but a &s;ubordinate chief, though of great power. Poulaho was now in|vited by the Captain on board, where he was not an unwelcome gue&s;t, as he brought with him two fat hogs, by way of pre&s;ent. This great per|&s;onage, though not very tall, was extremely un|wieldy, and almo&s;t &s;hapele&s;s with corpulence. He appeared to be about forty; his hair was &s;traight, and his features con&s;iderably different from tho&s;e of the majority of his people. We found him to be a man of gravity and good &s;en&s;e. He viewed the &s;hip, and the various new objects, with particular attention; and a&s;ked many per|tinent que&s;tions. When he had gratified his cu|rio&s;ity in looking at the cattle, and other no|velties, he was reque&s;ted to walk down into the cabin; to which &s;ome of his retinue objected, &s;aying, that, if he &s;hould go down thither, it would doubtle&s;s happen that people would walk over his head; a circum&s;tance that could not be permit|ted. Though the Captain offered to obviate this objection, by ordering that no one &s;hould pre|&s;ume to walk over the cabin, Poulaho waved all ceremony, and went down without any previous &s;tipulation. He now appeared to be no le&s;s &s;o|licitous than his people were, to convince us that he was &s;overeign, and not Feenou. He &s;at down to dinner with us, but eat and drank very little; and afterwards de&s;ired our Commodore to ac|company

him on &s;hore. Omai was a&s;ked to be one of the party; but he was too faithfully at|tached to Feenou, to &s;hew much re&s;pect to his competitor, and therefore declined the invita|tion. Captain Cook attended the chief in his own boat, having fir&s;t made him &s;uch pre&s;ents as ex|ceeded his expectations; in return for which, Pou|laho ordered two more hogs to be &s;ent on board. The chief was then carried out of the boat, by his own &s;ubjects, on a board re&s;embling a hand-barrow; and immediately &s;eated him&s;elf in a &s;mall hou&s;e near the &s;hore. He placed the Captian at his &s;ide, and his attendants formed a &s;emi-circle before them, on the out&s;ide of the hou&s;e. An old woman &s;at clo&s;e to the chief, with a kind of fan in her hand, to prevent his being incommoded by the flies. The various articles which his peo|ple had procured by trading on board the &s;hips, being now di&s;played before him, he attentively looked over them all, inquired what they had given in exchange, and, at length, ordered every thing to be returned to the re&s;pective owners, except a gla&s;s-bowl, which he re&s;erved for him|&s;elf. Tho&s;e who brought the&s;e things to him, fir&s;t &s;quatted them&s;elves down before him, then depo&s;ited their purcha&s;es, and in&s;tantly ro&s;e and retired. They ob&s;erved the &s;ame ceremony in taking them away; and not one of them pre&s;um|ed to &s;peak to him &s;tanding. His attendants, ju&s;t before they left him, paid him obei&s;ance, by

bowing their heads down to the &s;ole of his foot and touching it with the upper and under &s;ide of the fingers of each hand. Captain Cook was charmed with the decorum that was maintained on this occa&s;ion, having &s;carce &s;een the like any where, even among more civilized nations.</P>
<P>When the Captain arrived on board, he found me Ma&s;ter returned from his expedition, who in|formed him, that, as far as he had proceeded, there was a pa&s;&s;age for the &s;hips, and tolerable anchorage; but that towards the &s;outh and &s;outh-ea&s;t, he ob&s;erved numerous &s;hoals, breakers, and &s;mall i&s;les. In con&s;equence of this report, we relinqui&s;hed all thoughts of a pa&s;&s;age that way; and being re&s;olved to return to Annamooka by the &s;ame route which we had &s;o lately experienced to be a &s;afe one, we &s;hould have &s;ailed the next morning, which was the 28th, if the wind had not been very un&s;ettled. Poulaho came early on board, bringing a red-feather'd cap as a pre&s;ent to Captain Cook. The&s;e caps were greatly &s;ought after by us, as we knew they would be highly valued at Otaheite: but not one was ever brought for &s;ale, though very large prices were offered nor could a per&s;on in either &s;hip make him&s;elf the proprietor of one, except the two Captains and Omai. They are compo&s;ed of the tail feathers of the tropic bird, intermixed with the red fea|thers of the paroquet; and are made in &s;uch manner, as to tie on the forehead without any

crown, and have the form of a &s;emi-circle, who&s;e radius is eighteen or twenty inches. But the be&s;t idea of them will be conveyed by Mr. Webber's repre&s;entation of Poulaho, ornamented with one of the&s;e caps or bonnets. The chief left the &s;hip in the evening; but his brother, who&s;e name al&s;o was Futtafaihe, and &s;ome of his attendants, re|mained all night on board.</P>
<P>On the 29th, at day-break, we weighed with a fine breeze at ea&s;t north-ea&s;t, and made &s;ail to the we&s;tward, followed by &s;everal &s;ailing canoes, in one of which was Poulaho the king, who, getting on board the Re&s;olution, enquired for his bro|ther, and the others who had continued with us all night. We now found that they had &s;taid without his permi&s;&s;ion, for he gave them &s;uch a reprimand as brought tears from their eyes: how|ever, he was &s;oon reconciled to their making a longer &s;tay; for, on his departure from the &s;hip, he left his brother, and five attendants, on board. We were al&s;o honoured with the company of a chief named Tooboueitoa, ju&s;t then arrived from Tongataboo; who, as &s;oon as he came, &s;ent away his canoe, declaring, that he, and five others who came with him, would &s;leep on board; &s;o that Captain Cook now had his cabin filled with vi&s;itors. This inconvenience he the more willingly endured, as they brought with them plenty of provi&s;ions as pre&s;ents to him, for which they met with &s;uitable returns.</P>
<P><PB N="182" REF="030274_0238_0FE56C2C41BB09F8">In the afternoon the ea&s;terly wind was &s;ucceeded by a fre&s;h breeze at &s;outh &s;outh-ea&s;t. Our cour&s;e being now &s;outh &s;outh-we&s;t, we were obliged to ply to windward, and barely fetched the northern &s;ide of Footooha, by eight o'clock in the evening. The next day we plied up to Lofanga, and got &s;oundings, under the lee or north-we&s;t &s;ide of forty fathoms water; but the bottom being rocky and a chain of breakers lying to leeward, we &s;tretched away for Kotoo, expecting to find bet|ter anchorage there. It was dark before we reach|ed that i&s;land, where finding no convenient place to anchor in, we pa&s;&s;ed the night in making &s;hort boards. On the 31&s;t, at break of day, we &s;tood for the channel which is between Kotoo, and the reef of rocks lying to the we&s;tward of it; but, on our approach we found the wind in&s;ufficient to lead us through. We therefore bore up on the out&s;ide of the reef, and &s;tretched to the &s;outh-we&s;t till near twelve o'clock, when, perceiving that we made no progre&s;s to windward, and being apprehen&s;ive of lo&s;ing the i&s;lands while we had &s;o many of the natives on board, we tacked and &s;tood back, and &s;pent the night between Footooha and Kotoo. The wind now blew fre&s;h, with &s;qualls and rain; and, during the night, the Re|&s;olution, by a &s;mall change of the wind, fetching too far to the windward was very near running full upon a low &s;andy i&s;le, named Pooto Poo|tooa, encompa&s;&s;ed with breakers. Our people

having fortunately been ju&s;t ordered upon deck, to put the &s;hip about, and mo&s;t of them being at their re&s;pective &s;tations, the nece&s;&s;ary movements were performed with judgment and alertne&s;s; and this alone pre&s;erved us from de&s;truction. The Di&s;covery, being a&s;tern, incurred no danger.</P>
<P>This narrow e&s;cape &s;o alarmed the natives who were on board, that they were eagerly de&s;irous of getting a&s;hore: accordingly, on the return of day-light, a boat was hoi&s;ted out, and the officer who commanded her was ordered, after landing them at Kotoo, to &s;ound for anchorage along the reef that projects from that i&s;land. During the ab&s;ence of the boat, we endeavoured to turn the &s;hips through the channel between the reef of Kotoo and the &s;andy i&s;le; but meeting with a &s;trong current again&s;t us, we were obliged to de|&s;i&s;t, and ca&s;t anchor in fifty fathoms water, the &s;andy i&s;le bearing ea&s;t by north, about the di&s;|tance of one mile. Here we remained till the 4th of June, being frequently vi&s;ited by the king, by Tooboueitoa, and by people who came from the neighbouring i&s;lands to traffic with us. Mr. Bligh was, in the mean time di&s;patched to &s;ound the channels between the i&s;lands &s;ituate to the ea&s;tward; and Captain Cook him&s;elf landed on Kotoo, to take a &s;urvey of it. This i&s;land, on account of the coral reefs that environ it, is &s;carcely acce&s;&s;ible by boats. Its north-we&s;t end is low; but it ri&s;es &s;uddenly in the middle, and
<PB N="184" REF="030274_0240_0FE56C32C46D0E80">
terminates at the &s;outh ea&s;t: end in reddi&s;h clayey cliffs. It produces the &s;ame fruits and roots with the adjacent i&s;lands, and is tolerably cultivated, though thinly inhabited. It is about two miles in length. While the Commodore was walking all over it, our people were occupied in cutting gra&s;s for the cattle; and we planted &s;ome melon &s;eeds. On our return to the boat, we pa&s;&s;ed by &s;ome ponds of dirty bracki&s;h water, and &s;aw a burying-place, which was con&s;iderably neater than tho&s;e of Hapaee.</P>
<P>We weighed in the morning of the 4th, and with a fre&s;h gale at ea&s;t &s;outh-ea&s;t, made &s;ail to|wards Annamooka, where we anchored the next morning, nearly in the &s;ame &s;tation which we had &s;o lately occupied. Captain Cook &s;oon after went on &s;hore, and found the i&s;landers very bu&s;y in their plantations, digging up yams for traffic. In the cour&s;e of the day, about two hundred of them a&s;&s;embled on the beach, and traded with great eagerne&s;s. It appeared, that they had been very diligent, during our ab&s;ence, in cultivat|ing; for we now ob&s;erved &s;everal large plantain fields, in places which, in our late vi&s;it, we had &s;een lying wa&s;te. The yams were now in the highe&s;t perfection: and we obtained a good quan|tity of them, in exchange for iron. Before the Captain returned on board, he vi&s;ited the &s;eve|ral places where he had &s;own melon and cucum|ber &s;eeds; but found to his great regret, that
<PB N="185" REF="030274_0241_0FE56C349850BB40">
mo&s;t of them had been de&s;troyed by vermin; though &s;ome pine-apple plants, which he had al&s;o left, were in a thriving condition.</P>
<P>On Friday the 6th, about noon, Feenou ar|rived from Vavoo, and informed us, that &s;everal canoes, laden with hogs and other provi&s;ions, had &s;ailed with him from that i&s;land, but had been lo&s;t in the late tempe&s;tuous weather, and every per&s;on on board of them had peri&s;hed. This melancholy tale did not gain much credit with us, as we were by this time &s;ufficiently acquainted with the character of the relater. The truth perhaps was, that he had been unable to procure at Vavoo the expected &s;upplies; or, if he ob|tained any there, that he had left them at Ha|paee, which lay in his way back, and where he mu&s;t have heard that Poulaho had come to vi&s;it us; who therefore, he knew, would, as his &s;upe|rior, reap all the merit and reward of procuring the&s;e &s;upplies, without having had any partici|pation of the trouble. The invention, however, of this lo&s;s at &s;ea, was not ill managed; for we had lately had very &s;tormy weather. On the &s;uc|ceeding morning Poulaho, and &s;ome other chiefs, arrived; at which time Captain Cook happened to be a&s;hore with Feenou, who now appeared to be &s;en&s;ible of the impropriety of his conduct, in arrogating a character to which he had no ju&s;t claim; for he not only acknowledged Poulaho as &s;overeign of Tongataboo and the adjacent i&s;les,
<PB N="186" REF="030274_0242_0FE56C3628DDF5B8">
but affected to in&s;i&s;t much on it. The Captain left him, and went to pay a vi&s;it to the King, whom he found &s;itting with a few of the natives before him; but great numbers ha&s;tening to pay their re&s;pects to him, the circle increa&s;ed very fa&s;t. When Feenou approached, he placed him|&s;elf among the re&s;t that &s;at before Poulaho, as attendants on his maje&s;ty. He at fir&s;t &s;eemed to be &s;omewhat confu&s;ed and aba&s;hed; but &s;oon re|covered from his agitation. Some conver&s;ation pa&s;&s;ed between the&s;e two chiefs, who went on board with the Captain to dinner; but only Pou|laho &s;at at table. Feenou, after having made his obei&s;ance in the u&s;ual mode, by &s;aluting the foot of his &s;overeign with his head and hands, re|tired from the cabin, and it now appeared, that the could neither eat nor drink in the king's pre|&s;ence.</P>
<P>On the 18th, we weighed anchor, and &s;teered for Tongataboo, with a gentle breeze at north-ea&s;t. We were accompanied by fourteen or fif|teen &s;ailing ve&s;&s;els belonging to the I&s;landers, every one of which outran the &s;hips. The royal canoe was di&s;tingui&s;hed from the re&s;t by a &s;mall bundle of gra&s;s, of a red colour, fa&s;tened to the end of a pole, and fixed in the &s;tern of the canoe in the &s;ame manner as our en&s;ign &s;taffs. At five in the afternoon we de&s;cried two &s;mall i&s;lands, at the di&s;tance of four leagues to the we&s;tward; one was called Hoonga Hapaee, and the other Hoon|ga

Tonga. They are &s;ituated in the latitude of 20&deg; 36&prime; &s;outh, about ten leagues from the we&s;tern point of Annamooka. According to the infor|mation of two i&s;landers who had been &s;ent on board by Feenou as pilots, only five men re&s;ided on Hoonga Hapaee, and Hoonga Tonga had no inhabitants. We &s;till proceeded on a &s;outh-we&s;t cour&s;e, and on the 9th &s;aw &s;everal little i&s;lands, beyond which Eooa and Tongataboo appeared. We had at this time twenty-five fathoms water, the bottom con&s;i&s;ting of broken coral and &s;and; and the debth gradually decrea&s;ed, as we approach|ed the above-mentioned &s;mall i&s;les. Steering, by the direction of our pilots, for the wide&s;t &s;pace between tho&s;e i&s;les, we were in&s;en&s;ibly drawn upon a large flat, on which lay innumerable rocks of coral below the &s;urface of the &s;ea. Notwith|&s;tanding our utmo&s;t care and attention to avoid the&s;e rocks, we were unable to prevent the &s;hip from &s;triking on one of them: nor did the Di&s;|covery, though behind us, keep clear of them. It fortunately happened, that neither of the &s;hips &s;tuck fa&s;t, nor &s;u&s;tained any damage. We &s;till continued our cour&s;e; and the moment we found a place where we could anchor with any degree of &s;afety, we came to; and the Ma&s;ters were di&s;patched, with the boats, to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ound. Soon after we had ca&s;t anchor, &s;everal of the natives of Ton|gataboo came to us in their canoes; and they, as well as our pilots, a&s;&s;ured us, that we &s;hould
<PB N="188" REF="030274_0244_0FE56C3D0F9741B8">
meet with deep water further in, free from rocks. Their intelligence was true; for, about four o'clock, the boats made a &s;ignal of having found good anchoring ground. We therefore weighed, and &s;tood in till dark, when we anchored in nine fathoms water, with a clear &s;andy bottom. During the night, we had &s;ome rain; but early in the morning, the wind becoming &s;outherly, and bring|ing on fair weather, we weighed again, and work|ed towards the &s;hore of Tongataboo. While we were plying up to the harbour, the King conti|nued &s;ailing round us in his canoe; and at the &s;ame time there was a great number of &s;mall ca|noes about the &s;hips. Two of the&s;e not getting out of the way of his royal ve&s;&s;el, he ran quite over them, with the greate&s;t unconcern. Among the&s;e who came on board the Re&s;olution, was Otago, who had been &s;o u&s;eful to Captain Cook when he vi&s;ited Tongataboo in his la&s;t voyage; and one Toobou, who had, at that time, attach|ed him&s;elf to Captain Furneaux. Each of them brought &s;ome yams and a hog, in te&s;timony of friend&s;hip; for which they received a &s;uitable return.</P>
<P>We arrived at our intended &s;tation about two o'clock in the afternoon of the 10th of June. It was a very convenient place, formed by the &s;hore of Tongataboo on the &s;outh-ea&s;t, and two little i&s;les on the ea&s;t and north-ea&s;t. Here both our &s;hips anchored over a &s;andy bottom, where the
<PB N="189" REF="030274_0245_0FE56C3F5F555CC0">
depth of water was ten fathoms. Our di&s;tance from the &s;hore exceeded a quarter of a mile.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>WE had not been long at anchor off Ton|gataboo, when Captain Cook landed on the i&s;land, accompanied by &s;ome of the officers and Omai. They found the King waiting for them on the beach, who conducted them to a &s;mall neat hou&s;e near the woods, with an exten|&s;ive
<PB N="190" REF="030274_0246_0FE56C40EA1FA160">
area before it, and told the Captain, that it was at his &s;ervice during his continuance in the i&s;land. Before they had been long in the hou&s;e, a large circle of the natives a&s;&s;embled before them, and &s;eated them&s;elves upon the area. A root of the <HI>kava</HI> plant being brought to the king he commanded it to be &s;plit into pieces, and di&s;|tributed to &s;everal people, of both &s;exes, who began to chew it and &s;oon prepared a bowl of their favourite liquor. Mean while a baked hog, and a quantity of baked yams, were produced, and divided into ten portions. The&s;e &s;hares were given to &s;ome of tho&s;e who were pre&s;ent, except one, which remained undi&s;po&s;ed of, and which was probably re&s;erved for the King him&s;elf. The liquor was next &s;erved out; and the fir&s;t cup be|ing brought up to his maje&s;ty, he ordered it to be given to a per&s;on who &s;at near him: the &s;econd was al&s;o brought to him, which he kept: the third was given to Captain Cook; but, their mode of preparing the liquor having given him a di&s;ta&s;te for it, it was brought to Omai. The re|mainder of it was di&s;tributed to different people; and one of the cups being carried to Poulaho's brother, he retired with this, and with his &s;hare of the provi&s;ions. Some others al&s;o withdrew from the circle with their portions, becau&s;e they could neither eat nor drink in his maje&s;ty's pre|&s;ence: but there were others of an inferior rank, of both &s;exes, who both eat and drank before

him. Soon afterwards, the greater part of them went away, carrying with them what they had not eat of their &s;hare of the fea&s;t. It is worthy of remark, that the &s;ervants, who di&s;tributed the meat and the <HI>kava,</HI> delivered it &s;itting, not only to the king, but to the others.</P>
<P>Captain Cook, before he returned on board, went in &s;earch of a watering place, and was con|ducted to &s;ome ponds, in one of which the water was tolerable, but it was at &s;ome di&s;tance inland. Being informed that the &s;mall i&s;land of Pangi|modoo, near which the &s;hips were &s;tationed, could better &s;upply this important article, he went over to it the next morning, and found there a pool containing fre&s;her water than any he had met with among&s;t the&s;e i&s;lands. This pool being ex|tremely dirty, he cau&s;ed it to be cleaned; and here it was that we filled our water-ca&s;ks. The &s;ame morning, a tent was pitched near the hou&s;e which the king had a&s;&s;igned for our u&s;e. The hor&s;es, cattle, and &s;heep, were then landed, and a party of marines &s;tationed there as a guard. The ob&s;ervatory was &s;et up at an incon&s;iderable di&s;tance from the other tent; and Mr. King took up his re&s;idence on &s;hore, to direct the ob|&s;ervations, and &s;uperintend all other nece&s;&s;ary bu&s;ine&s;s. A party was occupied in cutting wood for fuel, and planks for the &s;hips; and the gun|ners were appointed to conduct the traffic with the inhabitants, who flocked from all parts of the
<PB N="192" REF="030274_0249_0FE56C501CF72558">
i&s;land with hogs, yams, cocoa-nuts, and other articles, in&s;omuch, that our land &s;tation re&s;em|bled a fair, and our &s;hips were remarkably crowd|ed with vi&s;itants. Feenou re&s;iding in our neigh|bourhood, we had daily proofs of his opulence and genero&s;ity, by the continuance of his valu|able donations. Poulaho was equally attentive to us in this re&s;pect, as &s;carcely a day pa&s;&s;ed with|out his &s;avouring us with co&s;iderable pre&s;ents. We were now informed, that a per&s;on of the name of Mareewagee was of very high rank in the i&s;land, and was treated with great reverence; nay, if our interpreter Omai did not mi&s;under|&s;tand his informers, that, he was &s;uperior to Pou|laho him&s;elf; but that, being advanced in years, he lived in retirement, and therefore was not in|clined to pay us a vi&s;it. This intelligence ex|citing the curio&s;ity of Captain Cook, he &s;ignified to Poulaho his intention of waiting upon Maree|wagee; and the king having agreed to accom|pany him, they &s;et out the next morning in the pinnace, Captain Clerke joining them in one of his own boats. They proceeded to the ea&s;tward of the little i&s;les which form the harbour, and then, turning towards the &s;outh, entered a &s;pa|cious bay, upon which they rowed about three miles, and landed amid&s;t a great concour&s;e of people, who received them with &s;houts and ac|clamations. The crowd in&s;tantly &s;eparated, that Poulaho might pa&s;s, who took our gentlemen
<PB N="193" REF="030274_0250_0FE56C51A2B3BA60">
into a &s;mall enclo&s;ure, and changed the piece of cloth he wore, for a new piece, very neatly folded: an old woman a&s;&s;i&s;ted in dre&s;&s;ing him, and put a large mat over his cloth. Being now a&s;ked where Mareewagee was, he &s;aid, to the great &s;urprize of the gentlemen, that he was gone down to the &s;hips. However, he reque&s;ted them to accompany him to a <HI>malaee,</HI> or hou&s;e of public re&s;ort; and when they came to a large area before it, he &s;eated him&s;elf in the path, while they, at his de&s;ire, walked up to the hou&s;e, and &s;at down in the front. After waiting a little while, they repeated their enquiries, by the medium of Omai, whether they were to be introduced to Mareewagee? But receiving no &s;atisfactory an|&s;wer, and being inclined to &s;u&s;pect that the aged chief was purpo&s;ely concealed from them, they returned to their boats much piqued at their di&s;|appointment. It afterwards appeared, that Ma|reewagee had not been there; and that, in this affair, &s;ome gro&s;s mi&s;takes had been made, Omai either having been mi&s;informed, or having mi&s;|under&s;tood what was told him concerning the old chief.</P>
<P>The place our gentlemen went to was a very plea&s;ant village, delightfully &s;ituated on the banks of the bay or inlet&punc; where mo&s;t of the principal per&s;ons of the i&s;land re&s;ide. Each of the&s;e has his hou&s;e in the mid&s;t of a &s;mall plan+tation, with a kind of out-hou&s;es, and offices for
<PB N="194" REF="030274_0251_0FE56C5376005358">
&s;ervants, The&s;e plantations are neatly fenced round, and, in general, have only one entrance, which is by a door fa&s;tened on the in&s;ide with a prop of wood. Between each plantation there are public roads and narrow lanes. A con&s;ider|able part of &s;ome of the&s;e enclo&s;ures is laid out in gra&s;s-plots, and planted with &s;uch things as &s;eem le&s;s adapted for u&s;e than for ornament. In &s;uch other plantations as were not the re&s;idence of per&s;ons of high rank, every article of the ve|getable produce of the i&s;land was in great plenty. Near the public roads are &s;ome large hou&s;es, with &s;pacious gra&s;s-plots before them, which are &s;aid to belong to the king, and are probably the places where their public meetings are held.</P>
<P>On Friday the 13th, about twelve o'clock, Ma|reewagee came within a &s;mall di&s;tance of our po&s;t on &s;hore, attended by a great number of people of all ranks. In the cour&s;e of the afternoon, the two Captains, and others of our gentlemen, accom|panied by Feenou, went a&s;hore to vi&s;it him. They found a per&s;on &s;itting under a tree, with a piece of cloth, about forty yards long, &s;pread before him, round which numbers of people were &s;eated. They imagined that this was the great per&s;onage, but were undeceived by Feenou, who informed them, that another, who was &s;it|ting on a piece of mat, was Mareewagee. To him they were introduced by Feenou; and he re|ceived them very graciou&s;ly, and de&s;ired them to
<PB N="195" REF="030274_0252_0FE56C5732492758">
&s;it down by him. The chief, who &s;at under the tree, was named Toobou, whom we &s;hall for the future call Old Toobou, to di&s;tingui&s;h him from his name&s;ake, who has been already mentioned as Captain Furneaux's friend. Both he and Ma|reewagee were venerable in their appearance. The latter was &s;lender in his per&s;on, and &s;eemed to be near &s;eventy years of age. Old Toobou was &s;omewhat corpulent, and almo&s;t blind from a di&s;|order in his eyes; he was younger than Maree|wagee. Captain Cook not expecting on this oc|ca&s;ion to meet with two chiefs, had brought on &s;hore a pre&s;ent for one only: this therefore he was obliged to divide between them; but, as it happened to be con&s;iderable, both of them ap|peared to be &s;atisfied, our party now entertained them about an hour with the performance of two French horns and a drum; but the firing of a pi&s;tol that Captain Clarke had in his pocket, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eemed to plea&s;e them mo&s;t. Before our gentle|men took their leave of the two chiefs, the large piece of cloth was rolled up, and pre&s;ented to Captain Cook, together with a few cocoa-nuts. The next morning, Old Toobou came on board to return the Commodore's vi&s;it; he al&s;o vi&s;ited Captain Clarke; and if our former pre&s;ent was not &s;ufficiently con&s;iderable, the deficiency was now &s;upplied. In the mean time, Mareewagee went to &s;ee our people who were &s;tationed on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hore; and Mr. King &s;hewed him whatever we
<PB N="196" REF="030274_0253_0FE56C59229C0FC8">
had there. He was &s;truck with admiration at the &s;ight of the cattle; and the cro&s;s-cut &s;aw rivet|ted his attention. Towards noon, Poulaho came on board, bringing with him his &s;on, who was about twelve years of age. He dined with Captain Cook; but the &s;on, though pre&s;ent, was not permitted to &s;it down with him. The Cap|tain found it very convenient to have him for his gue&s;t; for whenever he was pre&s;ent, (which was frequently the ca&s;e) every other native was ex|cluded from the table, and few of them would continue in the cabin: whereas, if neither he nor Feenou were on board, the chiefs of inferior rank were very importunate to be of the dining party, or to be admitted at that time into the cabin, which became con&s;equently very much crowded. The king was &s;oon reconciled to our cookery, and was fond of our wine. He now re&s;ided at the <HI>malaee</HI> near our tent, where he this evening entertained our people with a dance, in which he him&s;elf, though &s;o corpulent and unwieldy, engaged.</P>
<P>On the 15th, Captain Cook received a me&s;&s;age from Old Toobou, importing, that he was de|&s;irous of &s;eeing him on &s;hore. He and Omai accordingly waited on that chief, whom they found &s;itting, like one of the ancient patriarchs, under the &s;hade of a tree, with a large piece of cloth, the manufacture of the i&s;land, &s;pread out before him. He de&s;ired them to place them&s;elves
<PB N="197" REF="030274_0254_0FE56C5AAA7FCA90">
by him; after which he told Omai, that the cloth, with &s;ome cocoa-nuts, and red feathers, con&s;ti|tuted his pre&s;ent to Captain Cook. The latter thanked him for the donation, and reque&s;ted him to go on board with him. Omai, being &s;ent for by Poulaho, now left the Captain, who was in|formed by Feenou, that young Fattafaihe, the king's &s;on, de&s;ired to &s;ee him. He immediately obeyed the &s;ummons, and found the young prince and Omai &s;eated under a canopy of fine cloth, with a piece of a coar&s;er kind, &s;eventy-&s;ix yards long, and &s;even and a half broad, &s;pread before them and under them. On one &s;ide was a quan|tity of cocoa-nuts; and, on the other, a large boar. A multitude of people &s;at round the cloth; and among them was Mareewagee, with other per&s;ons of rank. The Captain was re|que&s;ted to &s;eat him&s;elf by the prince; and then Omai informed him, that he had been in&s;tructed by Poulaho to tell him, that as his maje&s;ty and the Captain were friends, he hoped that his &s;on Fattafaihe might be comprehended in this friend|&s;hip; and that the Captain, as a te&s;timony of his con&s;ent, would accept of the prince's pre&s;ent. Captain Cook readily agreed to this propo&s;al, and invited them all to dine with him on board. Accordingly, the young prince, Old Toobou, Mareewagee, three or four &s;ubordinate chiefs, and two old ladies of high rank, accompanied the Commodore to the &s;hip. Mareewagee was
<PB N="198" REF="030274_0255_0FE56C5C8CE8B7D0">
dre&s;&s;ed in a new piece of cloth, with &s;ix patches of red feathers on the &s;kirts of it. This dre&s;s was probably made on purpo&s;e for this vi&s;it; for, as &s;oon as he arrived on board, he put it off, and pre&s;ented it to Captain Cook. When dinner was &s;erved up, not one of them would even &s;it down, or eat a mor&s;el of any thing, as they were all <HI>taboo,</HI> they &s;aid; which word, though it has a very comprehen&s;ive meaning, generally &s;ignifies that a thing is prohibited. Why they were thus re&s;trained at pre&s;ent, was not accounted for. Having made pre&s;ents to them all, and gratified their curio&s;ity by &s;hewing them every part of the &s;hip, the Captain conducted them a&s;hore. When the boat had reached the land, Feenou and &s;eve|ral others immediately &s;tepped out; and the young prince following them, was called back by Mareewagee, who now paid the heir apparent the &s;ame obei&s;ance which the king was accu&s;|tomed to receive; and when Old Toobou, and one of the old ladies, had honoured him with the &s;ame marks of re&s;pect, he was &s;uffered to land. After this ceremony, the old people &s;tepped out of the boat into a canoe, which was waiting to con|vey them to their place of re&s;idence. Capt. Cook was plea&s;ed at being pre&s;ent on this occa&s;ion, as he was thus furni&s;hed with the mo&s;t convincing proofs of the &s;upreme dignity of Poulaho and his &s;on. By this time, indeed, he had gained &s;ome certain in|formation with regard to the relative &s;ituation of
<PB N="199" REF="030274_0256_0FE56C60267A1900">
&s;everal of the chiefs. He now knew, that old Toobou and Mareewage were brothers. Both of them were men of very con&s;iderable property, and in high e&s;timation with the people: Maree|wagee, in particular, had obtained the honour|able appellation of <HI>Motooa Tonga,</HI> which implies father of Tonga, or of his country. We al&s;o now under&s;tood, that he was the king's-father-in-law, Poulaho having e&s;pou&s;ed, one of his daughters, by whom he had young Fattafaihe: &s;o that Ma|reewagee was grandfather to the prince. As for Feenou, he was one of the &s;ons of Mareewagee, and Tooboueitoa was another.</P>
<P>Captain Cook, on his landing found Poulaho in the hou&s;e adjoining to our tent, who imme|diately made him a pre&s;ent of a quantity of yams and a hog. Towards evening a number of the i&s;landers came, and having &s;eated them&s;elves in a circle, &s;ung in concert with the mu&s;ic of bamboo-drums, which were placed in the centre. Three of them were long ones, and two were &s;hort. With the&s;e they &s;truck the ground end-wi&s;e. There were two others that lay &s;ide by &s;ide on the ground, one of which was partly &s;plit: on the&s;e a per&s;on continued beating with two &s;ticks. They &s;ung three &s;ongs while the Cap|tain &s;taid; and the entertainment la&s;ted, after he left them, till ten o'clock. They burned the leaves of the <HI>wharra</HI> palm for a light.</P>
<P><PB N="200" REF="030274_0257_0FE56DE61EC9D218">In the mean time, Mr. Ander&s;on, with &s;everal others, made an excur&s;ion into the country, which furni&s;hed him with ob&s;ervations to the following effect. We&s;tward of the tent, the country for about two miles is entirely uncultivated, though covered with trees and bu&s;hes growing naturally with the greate&s;t vigour. Beyond this a pretty large plain extends it&s;elf, on which are cocoa-trees, and &s;ome &s;mall plantations. Near the creek, which runs we&s;t of the tent, the land is perfectly flat, and partly overflowed every tide by the &s;ea. When the water retires, the &s;urface is &s;een to con&s;i&s;t of coral-rock, inter&s;per&s;ed with holes of yellowi&s;h mud; and near the edges, where it is rather more firm, are va&s;t numbers of little openings, whence i&s;&s;ue innumerable &s;mall crabs, which &s;warm upon the &s;pot, but are &s;o very nimble, that, when approached, they in&s;tantaneou&s;ly di&s;|appear, and baffle all the dexterity of the natives who endeavour to catch them. At this place is a work of art, which te&s;tifies &s;ome degree of in|genuity and per&s;everance: on one &s;ide is a nar|row cau&s;eway, which, gradually increa&s;ing in breadth, ri&s;es with a gentle a&s;cent to the height of ten feet, where its breadth is five paces, the whole length being about &s;eventy-four paces. Adjacent to this is a kind of circus, thirty paces in diameter, about one or two feet higher than the cau&s;eway that joins it; and in the middle of this circus &s;ome trees are planted. On the op|po&s;ite
<PB N="201" REF="030274_0258_0FE56CF824C77B48">
&s;ide, another cau&s;eway de&s;cends, which is partly in ruins, and not above forty paces in length. The whole is built of large coral-&s;tones, with earth on the &s;urface, which is overgrown with &s;hrubs and low trees. From its decaying in &s;eve|ral places, it is probably of &s;ome antiquity. It &s;eems to be of no &s;ervice at pre&s;ent, whatever may have been its u&s;e in former times. All the intelligence concerning it, that Mr. Ander&s;on could procure from the natives, was, that it was called Etchee, and belonged to the king.</P>
<P>In the morning of the 16th, Captain Cook and Mr Gore took a walk into the country; in the cour&s;e of which they met with an opportunity of &s;eeing the whole proce&s;s of making cloth, the principal manufacture of the&s;e i&s;lands, as well as of many others in the South Sea. An account of this operation, as performed here, may not impro|perly be &s;ubjoined. The manufacturers, who are of the female &s;ex, take the &s;lender &s;talks or trunks of the paper mulberry, which rarely grows more than &s;even feet in height, and about thickne&s;s of four fingers. From the&s;e &s;talks they &s;trip the bark, and &s;crape off the exterior rind: after which the bark is rolled up, and macerated for &s;ome time in water; it is then beaten with a &s;quare in|&s;trument of wood, full of coar&s;e grooves, but &s;ometimes with a plain one. The operation is often repeated by another per&s;on or the bark is &s;olded &s;everal times, and beat longer, which is
<PB N="202" REF="030274_0259_0FE56CF9D958EC10">
probably intended to clo&s;e rather than divide its texture. It is then &s;pread out to dry: the pieces being from four, to &s;ix or &s;even feet in length, and about half as broad. The&s;e pieces are join|ed by &s;mearing part of them with the glutinous juice of a berry called <HI>tooo</HI>; and, after being thus lengthened, they are placed over a large piece of wood, with a &s;ort of &s;tamp, compo&s;ed of a fibrous &s;ub&s;tance, laid beneath them. The manufac|turers then take a bit of cloth, and having dip|ped it in a juice extracted from the bark of a tree called <HI>kokka,</HI> rub it bri&s;kly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ver the piece that is making. This leaves upon the &s;urface a dry glo&s;s, and a dull brown colour; and the &s;tamp makes, at the &s;ame time, a &s;light impre&s;&s;ion. Thus they proceed, joining and &s;taining by degrees, till a piece of cloth, of the requi&s;ite length and breadth, is produced. They generally leave a border, about a foot broad, at the &s;ides, and rather lon|ger at the ends, un&s;tained. If any parts of the original pieces have holes, or are too thin, they giue &s;pare bits upon them, till their thickne&s;s equals that of the re&s;t. Whenever they are de|&s;irous of producing a black colour, they mix the juice of the <HI>kokka</HI> with the &s;oot procured from an oily nut called <HI>dooedooe.</HI> They a&s;&s;ert, that the black cloth, which is u&s;ually mo&s;t glazed, makes a cold dre&s;s, but the other a warm one.</P>
<P>The Commodore and Mr. Gore, meeting with Feenou on their return from their excur&s;ion, took
<PB N="203" REF="030274_0260_0FE56CFBD2750D48">
him, and another chief, on board to dinner; which being &s;erved up, neither of them would eat a mor|&s;el, alledging that they were <HI>taboo avy;</HI> but when they found, that, in dre&s;&s;ing a pig and &s;ome yams no avy (water) had been made u&s;e of, they both &s;at down, and eat very heartily, and drank &s;ome wine, on being a&s;&s;ured that there was no water in it. From this circum&s;tance we inferred, that they were at this time, for &s;ome particular rea&s;on, forbidden to u&s;e water; or that, perhaps, they did not like the water we then u&s;ed, it being taken out of one of the places where the i&s;land|ers bathed.</P>
<P>The following day, which was the 17th, was fixed upon by Mareewagee for giving a grand <HI>haiva,</HI> or entertainment, at which we were all in|vited to attend. Before the temporary hut of this chief, near our land &s;tation, a large &s;pace had been cleared for that purpo&s;e. In the morn|ing, va&s;t numbers of the natives came in from the country, every one of whom bore on his &s;houlder a long pole, at each end of which a yam was &s;u&s;pended. The&s;e poles and yams being de|po&s;ited on each &s;ide of the open &s;pace, or area, formed two large heaps, decorated with &s;mall fi&s;h of different kinds. They were Mareewagee's pre&s;ent to the Captains Cook and Clerke. The nece&s;&s;ary preparations being made, the i&s;landers began, about eleven o'clock, to exhibit various dances, which they call <HI>mai.</HI> The band of mu&s;ic
<PB N="204" REF="030274_0261_0FE56D01CDC26A48">
at fir&s;t con&s;i&s;ted of &s;eventy men as a chorus, amid&s;t whom were placed three in&s;truments that we called drums, though they did not much re|&s;emble them. They are cylindrical pieces of wood, from three to four feet in length, &s;ome of them twice as thick as a man of ordinary &s;ize, and &s;ome not &s;o large. They are entirely hollow, but clo&s;e at each end, and open only by a chink, about the breadth of three inches, running nearly the whole length of the drums. By this opening, the re&s;t of the wood is hallowed; which mu&s;t be an operation of &s;ome difficulty. This in&s;trument is called by the natives <HI>naffa</HI>; and, having the chink turned towards them, they &s;it and beat vi|gorou&s;ly upon it, with two cylindrical pieces of wood, as thick as the wri&s;t, and about a foot in length; by which means a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rude, but loud and powerful &s;ound, is produced. They occa&s;ionally vary the &s;trength and rate of their beating: and likewi&s;e change the tones, by beating towards the end, or in the middle of the in&s;trument.</P>
<P>There were four ranks, of twenty-four men each, in the fir&s;t dance. The&s;e held in their hands a &s;mall thin wooden in&s;trument, above two feet in length, re&s;embling in its &s;hape an oblong pad|dle. With the&s;e in&s;truments, which are called <HI>pagge,</HI> they made many different motions; &s;uch as pointing them towards the ground on one &s;ide, and inclining their bodies that way at the &s;ame in&s;tant: then &s;hifting them to the oppo&s;ite &s;ide
<PB N="205" REF="030274_0262_0FE56D035EEB92B8">
in the &s;ame manner; pa&s;&s;ing them with great quickne&s;s from one hand to the other, and twirl|ing them about with remarkable dexterity; with various other manoeuvres. Their motions, which were &s;low at fir&s;t, quickened as the drums beat fa&s;ter; and they repeated &s;entences the whole time in a mu&s;ical tone, which were an&s;wered by the chorus; but in a &s;hort time, they all joined, and ended with a &s;hout. After a ce&s;&s;ation of a few minutes, they began as before, and conti|nued, with &s;hort intervals, upwards of a quarter of an hour; and then the rear rank dividing, moved &s;lowly round each end, met in the front, and formed the fir&s;t rank: during which time the whole number continued to recite &s;entences. The other ranks &s;ucce&s;&s;ively did the &s;ame, till that which was foremo&s;t became the rear; and this evolution did not cea&s;e till the la&s;t rank regained its former &s;ituation. A much quicker dance, though &s;low at fir&s;t, was then begun, and they &s;ung for ten minutes, when the whole body, in a two-fould divi&s;ion, retreated, and then advanced, forming a kind of circular ugure, which con|cluded the dance; the chorus retiring, and the drums being removed, at the &s;ame time.</P>
<P>In the &s;econd dance, there were forty men as a chorus, with only two drums; and the dancers (or rather actors) con&s;i&s;ted of two ranks, the fore|mo&s;t of which had &s;eventeen per&s;ons, and the other fifteen. Feenou was in the middle of the
<PB N="206" REF="030274_0263_0FE56D04E4A28270">
fir&s;t rank, which is con&s;idered, on the&s;e occa&s;ions, as the principal place. They danced and repeat|ed &s;entences, with very &s;hort intervals, for half an hour, &s;ometimes &s;lowly, and at other times quickly, with the highe&s;t degree of exactne&s;s and regularity. Towards the clo&s;e, the rear-rank divided, came round, and occupied the place of the front, which afterwards re&s;umed its pri&s;tine &s;ituation. This dance being fini&s;hed, the drums were taken away, and the chorus retired, as in the preceding dance.</P>
<P>Three very large drums were now brought in, and &s;eventy men &s;erved as a chorus to the third dance. This con&s;i&s;ted of two ranks, of &s;ixteen men each, having young Toobou at their head, who was &s;plendidly ornamented with a kind of garment covered with red feathers. The&s;e per|&s;ons danced, &s;ung, and twirled the <HI>pagge,</HI> &s;o as to meet with the continual applau&s;es of the &s;pec|tators, who were particularly plea&s;ed with a mo|tion in which they held the face a&s;ide as if a&s;ham|ed, with the <HI>pagge</HI> before it. The hindmo&s;t rank clo&s;ed before the front one, which &s;oon af|ter re&s;umed its place, as in the fir&s;t and &s;econd dances: then beginning again, they formed a triple row, divided, retreated to each end of the area, and left the ground in a great mea&s;ure clear. Two men ru&s;hing in at that in&s;tant, began to exerci&s;e the clubs which they make u&s;e of in bat|tle. They fir&s;t twirled them in their hands, and
<PB N="207" REF="030274_0264_0FE56D066BD40FF0">
made circular &s;trokes before them with great quickne&s;s, managing with &s;uch &s;kill, that, though they &s;tood clo&s;e to each other, they never inter|fered. They &s;hifted the clubs, with uncommon dexterity, from one hand to the other; and, af|ter &s;ome time, kneeled down, and made various motions, to&s;&s;ing up their clubs in the air, and catching them as they fell. They then retired as ha&s;tily as they had entered. They had pieces of white cloth about their heads, fa&s;tened at the crown with a wreath of foliage round their fore|heads, and, that they might be free from all in|cumbrance, they had only a very &s;mall piece of cloth tied round the wai&s;t. A man, armed with a &s;pear, then ru&s;hed in, and put him&s;elf in a me|nacing attitude as if he intended to &s;trike with his weapon at one of the people in the crowd; at the &s;ame time bending the knee a little, and trembling as it were with fury. He continued in this po&s;ition near a minute, and then moved to the other &s;ide, where having &s;tood in the &s;ame po&s;ture, he ha&s;tily retreated from the area. Du|ring all this time the dancers, who had divided them&s;elves into two parties, continued to repeat &s;omething &s;lowly; and they now came forward, and joined again, concluding the dance with ge|neral applau&s;e. This dance was probably con|&s;idered as a capital performance, as &s;ome of the principal people were engaged in it; one of the drums being beat by Futtafaihe, the king's bro|ther,
<PB N="208" REF="030274_0265_0FE56D0C0EE8D948">
another by Feenou, and the third by Maree|wagee him&s;elf.</P>
<P>In the fourth and la&s;t dance, there were forty men as a chorus, with two drums. The per|formers were &s;ixty men, arranged in three rows having twenty-four in front. Before they com|menced, we were entertained with a preliminary harangue, in which the whole number made re|&s;ponces to an individual &s;peaker. They recited &s;entences alternately with the chorus, and made with the <HI>pagge</HI> many quick motions. They di|vided into two parties, with their backs to each other; formed again, &s;hifted their ranks (as in the preceding dances) divided, and retreated, being &s;ucceeded by two men who exerci&s;ed their clubs, as before, after whom came two others; the dancers in the mean time repeating in their turns with the chorus: they then advanced, and terminated the dance.</P>
<P>The&s;e amu&s;ements continued from eleven o'clock till near three. The number of i&s;landers who attended as &s;pectators, together with tho&s;e who were round the trading-place at the tent, or &s;trag|ling about, amounted to at lea&s;t ten thou&s;and, all within the compa&s;s of a quarter of a mile. If we had under&s;tood what was &s;poken in this en|tertainment, we might probably have gained much information with regard to the genius and cu&s;toms of the&s;e people. Though the &s;pecta|tors con&s;tantly applauded the different motions,
<PB N="209" REF="030274_0266_0FE56D0DF6EB24A0">
when well made, a con&s;iderable &s;hare of the plea|&s;ure they received, &s;eemed to ari&s;e from the &s;en|timental part, or what the performers recited. However, the mere acting part well de&s;erved our notice, on account of the exten&s;ivene&s;s of the plan, the variety of the motions, and the exact unity, ea&s;e, and gracefulne&s;s, with which they were per|formed.</P>
<P>In the evening we were entertained with the <HI>bomai,</HI> or night dances, on a large area before the temporary dwelling-place of Feenou. They con|tinued three hours&punc; during which time about twelve of them were performed, nearly in the &s;ame manner as tho&s;e at Hapaee. In two of them, which were performed by women, a party of men came and formed a circle within their's. In ano|ther, which con&s;i&s;ted of twenty-four men, many motions that we had not before &s;een, were made with the hands, and met with great applau&s;e. The mu&s;ic was once changed in the cour&s;e of the evening; and in one of the dances, Feenou him|&s;elf appeared at the head of fifty men: he was well dre&s;&s;ed in linen, and &s;ome &s;mall pictures were hung round his neck.</P>
<P>Though the whole entertainment was conducted with better order than could rea&s;onably have been expected, yet our utmo&s;t care and attention could not prevent our being plundered by the natives, in the mo&s;t daring and in&s;olent manner. There was &s;carcely any thing which they did not en|deavour
<PB N="210" REF="030274_0267_0FE56D0F840A5510">
to &s;teal. They once, in the middle of the day, attempted to take an anchor from off the Di&s;covery's bows; but without effect. The only violence of which they were guilty, was, the breaking the &s;houlder-bone of one of our goats; in con&s;equence of which &s;he died &s;oon after. On Wedne&s;day the 18th, an i&s;lander got out of a canoe into the Re&s;olution, and &s;tole a pewter-ba&s;on; but being detected, he was pur&s;ued, and brought along-&s;ide the &s;hip. Upon this occa|&s;ion, three old women in the canoe made loud lamentations over the pri&s;oner. beating their faces and brea&s;ts with the palms of their hands in a very violent manner, but without &s;hedding a tear. This mode of expre&s;&s;ing &s;orrow occa|&s;ions the mark which mo&s;t of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e people bear on the face over their cheek-bones; for the re|peated blows inflicted by them on this part, abrade the &s;kin, and cau&s;e &s;ome blood to flow out; and when the wound is recent, it looks as if a hollow circle had been made by burning. On &s;ome occa&s;ions, they cut this part of the face with an in&s;trument.</P>
<P>The &s;ame day Captain Cook be&s;towed &s;ome pre&s;ents on Mareewagee, in return for tho&s;e which had been received from that chief the preceding day; and as the entertainments then exhibited called upon us to make &s;ome exhibition in re|turn, he ordered all the marines to go through their exerci&s;e, on the &s;pot where the late dances
<PB N="211" REF="030274_0268_0FE56D116A21ACD0">
had been performed; and, in the evening&punc; &s;ome fire-works were al&s;o played off at the &s;ame place. The King, the principal chiefs, and a va&s;t mul|titude of people, were pre&s;ent. The platoon fiiring &s;eemed to plea&s;e them; but, when they beheld our water-rockets, they were filled with a&s;toni&s;h|ment and admiration. They did not much re|gard the fife and drum, or French horns, that were playing during the intervals. Poulaho &s;at behind every one, no per&s;on being permitted to &s;it behind him; and, that his view might receive no ob&s;truction, none &s;at immediately before him; but a lane, as it were, was made by the &s;pecta|tors from him, quite down to the &s;pace allotted for playing off the fire-works.</P>
<P>While the natives were in expectation of this evening's exhibition, they engaged, for the greate&s;t part of the afternoon, in wre&s;tling and boxing. When a per&s;on is de&s;irous of wre&s;tling, he gives a challenge by cro&s;&s;ing the ground in a kind of mea&s;ured pace, and clapping &s;martly on the elbow joint of one arm, which is bent, and &s;ends forth a hollow &s;ound. If no opponent &s;teps forth, he returns and &s;its down; but if an antagoni&s;t ap|pears, they meet with marks of the greate&s;t good-nature, generally &s;miling, and deliberately ad|ju&s;ting the piece of cloth that is fa&s;tened round the wai&s;t. They then lay hold of each other by this cloth, and he who &s;ucceeds in drawing his opponent to him, in&s;tantly endeavours to lift him
<PB N="212" REF="030274_0269_0FE56D182516A4E8">
upon his brea&s;t, and throw him on his back; and if he can turn round with him in that po&s;ition two or three times, before he throws him, he meets with great applau&s;e for his dexterity. If they are more equally matched, they quickly clo&s;e, and attempt to throw each other by entwin|ing their legs, or rai&s;ing each other from the ground; in which &s;truggles they di&s;play an ex|traordinary exertion of &s;trength. When one of them is thrown, he immediately retires; while the conqueror &s;its down for near a minute then ri&s;es, and goes to the &s;ide from which he came, where the victory is proclaimed aloud. After &s;itting for a &s;hort time, he ri&s;es again, and chal|lenges; and if &s;everal antagoni&s;ts appear, he has the privilege of choo&s;ing which of them he plea&s;es to engage wit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&punc; he may al&s;o, if he &s;hould throw his competitor, challenge again, till he him&s;elf is vanqui&s;hed; and then the people on the op|po&s;ite &s;ide chant the &s;ong of victory in favour of their champion. It frequently happens, that five or &s;ix ri&s;e from each &s;ide, and give challenges together; &s;o that it is not uncommon to &s;ee &s;e|veral &s;ets engaged on the field at the &s;ame time. They pre&s;erve great temper in this exerci&s;e, and leave the &s;pot without the lea&s;t di&s;plea&s;ure in their countenances. When they find that they are too equally matched, they de&s;i&s;t by mutual con&s;ent; and if it does not clearly appear which of them has had the advantage, both &s;ides proclaim the
<PB N="213" REF="030274_0270_0FE56D19F99B5C38">
victory, and then they engage again. But no one, who has been vanqui&s;hed, is permitted to engage a &s;econd time with his conqueror.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who intend to box advance &s;ide-ways, changing the &s;ide at every pace, having one arm &s;tretched out before, the other behind; and hold|ing in one hand a piece of cord, which they wrap clo&s;ely about it, when they meet with an oppo|nent. This is probably intended to prevent a di&s;location of the hand or fingers. Their blows are dealt out with great quickne&s;s and activity, and are aimed principally at the head. They box equally well with either hand. One of their mo&s;t dexterous blows i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, to turn round on the heel, ju&s;t after they have &s;truck their adver&s;ary, and to give him another pretty violent blow with the other hand backward. In boxing-matches, unle&s;s a per&s;on &s;trikes his antagoni&s;t to the ground they never &s;ing the &s;ong of victory; which &s;hews, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> this diver&s;on is le&s;s approved among them than wre&s;tling. Not only boys engage in both the&s;e exerci&s;es; but it not unfrequently happens, that little girls box with great ob&s;tinacy. On all the&s;e occa&s;ions, they do not con&s;ider it as any di&s;grace to be overcome; and the vanqui&s;hed per&s;on &s;its down with as much indifference as if he had never engaged. Some of our people con|tended with them in both exerci&s;es, but were generally wor&s;ted.</P>
<P><PB N="214" REF="030274_0271_0FE56D1B87F932E0">Captain Cook intending to leave behind him &s;ome of the animals he had brought, thought proper to make a di&s;tribution of them before his departure. He therefore, on the 10th, a&s;&s;embled the chiefs before our hou&s;e, and marked out his intended pre&s;ents to them. To the king he gave a bull and a cow; to Mareewagee, a Cape ram, and two ewes; and to Feenou, a hor&s;e and a mare. He in&s;tructed Omai to tell them, that no &s;uch animals exi&s;ted within &s;everal months &s;ail of their i&s;land; that he had brought them, with a great degree of trouble and expence, for their u&s;e; that, therefore, they ought to be careful not to kill any of them till they had multiplied con&s;i|derably; and, finally, that they and their po&s;te|rity ought to remember, that they had received them from the natives of Britain. Omai al&s;o explained to them their re&s;pective u&s;es, as far as his limited knowledge in &s;uch points would per|mit him. The Captain had intended to give old Toobou two or three goats; but finding that chief indifferent about them, he added them to the &s;hare of Poulaho. It &s;oon appeared, that &s;ome of the natives were di&s;&s;atisfied with the al|lotment of our animals; for, the next morning, two of our turkey-cocks, and one kid, were mi&s;|&s;ing. Our Commodore being determined to get them re&s;tored, &s;eized on three canoes that were along-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">de the &s;hips; then went on &s;hore, and having found his maje&s;ty, his brother, Feenou,
<PB N="215" REF="030274_0272_0FE56D1D59E94918">
and &s;ome other chiefs, in our hou&s;e, he immedi|ately appointed a guard over them, and intimated to them, that they mu&s;t continue under re&s;traint, till not only the turkeys and the kid, but the other things of which he had been plundered at various times, were re&s;tored to us. They a&s;&s;ured him, that the things in que&s;tion &s;hould all be re|turned; and then &s;at down to drink <HI>kava,</HI> with an appearance of unconcern. Soon afterwards, an axe, and an iron wedge, were brought to us. Some armed natives, in the mean time, began to a&s;&s;emble behind the hou&s;e; but they di&s;per&s;ed when a part of our guard marched again&s;t them; and the chiefs, at the in&s;tigation of the Commo|dore, gave orders that no more &s;hould appear. When he invited them to dine with him on board, they readily con&s;ented. Some of them having afterwards objected to Poulaho's going, he ro&s;e up immediately, and declared that he would be the fir&s;t man. Accordingly, the chiefs went on board with Captain Cook, and remained in the &s;hip till near four o'clock. He then conducted them a&s;hore; and, not long after, the kid and one of the turkeys were re&s;tored to him. On their promi&s;ing that the other turkey &s;hould be brought back the next morning, he relea&s;ed both them and the canoes.</P>
<P>Captain Cook now walked out with Omai, with a view of ob&s;erving how the natives in our neigh|bourhood fared; for this was the u&s;ual time of
<PB N="216" REF="030274_0273_0FE56D2104C1F4E0">
their meals. He found that they were, in gene|ral, ill &s;upplied; a circum&s;tance not to be won|dered at, &s;ince mo&s;t of the yams, and other pro|vi&s;ions that they brought with them, were di&s;|po&s;ed of to us; and they were unwilling to re|turn to their own habitations, while they could procure any &s;u&s;tenance near our po&s;t. That par|ticular part of the i&s;land, where our &s;tation was, being uncultivated, there were none of the na|tives who had a fixed re&s;idence within half a mile of us. Tho&s;e therefore who were at our po&s;t, were obliged to live under trees and bu&s;hes, or in temporary &s;hades; and the cocoa-trees were &s;tripped of their branches, for the purpo&s;e of erecting huts for the chiefs.</P>
<P>Omai and the Captain, in the cour&s;e of their walk, found &s;ix or &s;even women at &s;upper toge|ther, two of whom were fed by the others. On their a&s;king the the rea&s;on of this circum&s;tance, the women replied, <HI>taboo mattee.</HI> Upon further en|quiry it appeared, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> one of them, about two months before, had wa&s;hed the corp&s;e of a chief, on which account &s;he was not allowed to handle any food for five months; and that the other had performed the &s;ame office to the dead body of a per&s;on of inferior rank, and was therefore under a &s;imilar re&s;triction though not for &s;o long a &s;pace.</P>
<P>On Saturday the 21&s;t, early in the morning, Pou|laho came on board, to invite Captain Cook to an
<PB N="217" REF="030274_0274_0FE56D23563FA208">
<HI>baiva</HI> or entertainment, which he de&s;igned to give the &s;ame day. He had already had his head be&s;meared with red pigment, in order to com|municate a red colour to his hair, which was na|turally of a dark brown. The Captain, after breakfa&s;t, attended him to the &s;hore, and found the i&s;landers very bu&s;y in two places, fixing, in a &s;quare and upright po&s;ition, four very long po&s;ts, at the di&s;tance of near two feet from each other. They afterwards filled up with yams the &s;pace between the po&s;ts; and fa&s;tened &s;ticks acro&s;s, from one po&s;t to another, at the di&s;tance of every four feet, to prevent the po&s;ts from &s;eparating, by the weight of the inclo&s;ed yams, and al&s;o to a&s;cend by. As &s;oon as the yams had reached the &s;ummit of the fir&s;t po&s;ts, they continued to fa&s;ten others to them, till each pile was thirty feet or more in height. They placed, on the top of one of the piles, two bakedhogs; and, on the top of the other, a living one: and they tied another by the legs half-way up. The facility and di&s;|patch with which the&s;e two piles were rai&s;ed, were remarkable. After they had completed them, they accumulated &s;ome other heaps of yams, and al&s;o of bread-fruit, on each &s;ide of the area; to which a turtle, and a great quantity of excellent fi&s;h, were added. The whole of this, with &s;ome red feathers, a mat, and a piece of cloth, com|po&s;ed the king's pre&s;ent to Captain Cook. About one o'clock the <HI>mai,</HI> or dances, were begun.
<PB N="218" REF="030274_0275_0FE56D24DF46E988">
The fir&s;t of the&s;e very nearly re&s;embled the fir&s;t that was performed at Mareewagee's entertain|ment. The &s;econd was conducted by young Toobou; and in this, four or five women were introduced, who equalled the men in the exact|ne&s;s and regularity of their motions. Near the end, the performers divided, in order to leave room for two champions, who exerci&s;ed their clubs. In the third dance, which was the la&s;t, two other men, with clubs, exibited their &s;kill and activity. The dances were &s;ucceeded by boxing and wre&s;tling; and one man entered the li&s;ts with a kind of heavy club, made from the &s;tem of a cocoa-leaf, but could meet with no opponent to engage him in &s;o rough a diver&s;ion. Towards the evening, the <HI>bomai,</HI> or night-dances, began, in which the king him&s;elf, apparelled in Engli&s;h manufacture, was a performer: but nei|ther the&s;e, nor the dances in the day-time, were &s;o capital as tho&s;e of Feenou, or Mareewagee.</P>
<P>The Commodore, in order to be pre&s;ent the whole time, dined on &s;hore. Poulaho &s;at down with him, but neither eat nor drank, which was owing to the pre&s;ence of a female, who had been admitted, at his reque&s;t, to the dining party, and who, as we were informed in the &s;equel, was of &s;uperior rank to him&s;elf. This lady had no &s;ooner dined, then he walked up to Poulaho, who ap|plied his hands to her feet; after which &s;he re|retired. He immediately dipped his fingers into

a gla&s;s of wine, and then all her attendants paid him obei&s;ance. At his de&s;ire, &s;ome of our fire|works were played off in the evening: but being damaged, they did not an&s;wer the expectations of the &s;pectators.</P>

<P>NO more entertainments being expected on either &s;ide, and the curio&s;ity of the popu|lace being in a great degree &s;atisfied, mo&s;t of them de&s;erted us the day after Poulaho's <HI>haiva.</HI>
<PB N="220" REF="030274_0277_0FE56D2C4C1798A8">
Still, however, we had thieves among us, and had continual in&s;tances of their depredations.</P>
<P>Some of the officers of both &s;hips, who had made an excur&s;ion into the interior parts of the i&s;land, returned the 22d of June in the evening after an ab&s;ence of two days. They had taken their mu&s;kets and nece&s;&s;ary ammunition with them, be&s;ides &s;everal &s;mall articles of the favourite commodities; the whole of which the natives had the dexterity to &s;teal from them, in the cour&s;e of their &s;hort journey. Inconvenient con&s;equences were likely to have attended this affair; for, when our plundered travellers returned, they employed Omai, without con&s;ulting Captain Cook, to com|plain to the king of the treatment they had re|ceived. He, not knowing how the Captain would proceed in this affair, and apprehending that he might again lay him under re&s;traint, &s;et off early the next morning, and Feenou followed his example; &s;o that not a chief of authority was now remaining in our neighbourhood. The Cap|tain was offended at this bu&s;ine&s;s, and repri|manded Omai for having pre&s;umed to interfere in it. This reprimand induced him to endeavour to bring back his friend Feenou, and he &s;ucceeded in his negociation, by a&s;&s;uring him that no vio|lent mea&s;ures would be pur&s;ued to oblige the natives to return what they had &s;tolen. Tru&s;ting to this declaration, Feenou came back in the
<PB N="221" REF="030274_0278_0FE56D2DD5444660">
evening, and was favourably received. Poulaho al&s;o favoured us with his company the next day.</P>
<P>Upon this occa&s;ion, the two chiefs very ju&s;tly ob&s;erved to Captain Cook, that, whenever any of his people wanted to take an excur&s;ion into the country, they ought to be made acquainted with it, that they might order proper people to attend them, to prevent &s;uch outrages. And, had this precaution been taken, it is not to be doubted but that a man and his property would have been as &s;afe here, as in other parts of the more civi|lized world. Though the Captain did not after|wards endeavour to recover the articles taken upon this occa&s;ion, the whole of them were re|turned through the interpo&s;ition of Feenou, ex|cept one mu&s;ket, and a few other in&s;ignificant articles. By this time al&s;o, we recovered the tools and other matters, that had been &s;tolen from our workmen.</P>
<P>On Wedne&s;day the 25th of June, two boats, which Captain Cook had &s;ent in &s;earch of a com|modious channel to &s;ea, returned. The com|manders of them reported, that the channel to the north, through which we came in, was imminent|ly dangerous, being full of coral rocks; that there was a good channel to the ea&s;tward, though contracted, in one place, by the &s;mall i&s;lands; con&s;equently a we&s;terly wind would be nece&s;&s;ary to get through it. We had now recruited our &s;hips, and repaired our &s;ails, and had little more
<PB N="222" REF="030274_0279_0FE56D2F5DC3C040">
to expect of the produce of the i&s;land; but as an eclip&s;e of the &s;un was to happen on the 5th of July, the Captain determined to &s;tay till that time, to have a chance of ob&s;erving it.</P>
<P>Having now &s;ome lei&s;ure before us, Captain Cook, and a party of us accompanied by Pou|laho, &s;et out the next morning, in a boat, for Mooa, a kind of village, where he and the other men of con&s;equence, u&s;ually re&s;ide. Rowing up the inlet, we &s;aw fourteen canoes fi&s;hing in company; in one of which was Poulaho's &s;on. They had then taken &s;ome fine mullets, about a dozen of which they put into a boat. They &s;hewed us their whole method of fi&s;hing, which appeared to be an effectual one.</P>
<P>Taking leave of the prince and his fi&s;hing party, we were rowed to the bottom of the bay, and landed where we had done before, when we went to &s;ee Mareewagee. As &s;oon as we got on &s;hore we were conducted to one of Poulaho's hou&s;es; which, though tolerably large, &s;eemed to be his private place of re&s;idence, and was &s;ituated within a plantation. The king &s;eated him&s;elf at one end of the hou&s;e, and tho&s;e who came to vi&s;it him, &s;at down in a &s;emi-circle at the other end. A bowl of <HI>kava</HI> was immediately prepared for us, and directions were given to bake &s;ome yams. While the&s;e were getting ready, &s;ome of us, to|gether with a few of the king's attendants, and Omai as our interpreter, went to take a view of a

One of the hou&s;es was open on one &s;ide, and two wooden <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">u&s;ts of men, rudely carved, were within it. We enquired of the natives who followed us, (but dur&s;t not enter here) what the&s;e images were; who informed us, that they were memo|rials of &s;ome chiefs who had been buried there, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nd not meant as the repre&s;entatives of any deity&punc; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ch monuments, it is pre&s;umed, are &s;eldom <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;ed; for the&s;e appeared to have been erected <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ny ages.</P>
<P>We were informed that dead bodies had been <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> in each of the&s;e hou&s;es, but no marks of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> were to be di&s;tingui&s;hed.

They greatly re&s;emble the cypre&s;s, and had a very &s;olemn effect. A row of low palms was al&s;o planted near one of the hou&s;es.</P>
<P>After refre&s;hing our&s;elves with &s;ome provi&s;i|ons which we had brought from our &s;hips, we took a pretty large circuit into the country, at|tended by one of the king's mini&s;ters, who would not &s;uffer any of the rabble to follow us, and obliged tho&s;e whom we met upon our progre&s;s, to &s;it down while we were pa&s;&s;ing; a mark of re|&s;pect due only to their &s;overeigns. The greate&s;t part of the country was cultivated, and mo&s;t of their plantations fenced round. Some parts, in|deed, lay fallow, and others in a &s;tate of nature; the latter afforded large quantities of timber.</P>
<P>We found many public and well-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">aten paths, leading to different parts of the i&s;land. Travel|ling here was, indeed, very commodious, the roads being excellent, and the country level. We were conducted to &s;everal pools and &s;prings of water, but they were, in general, either bracki&s;h or &s;tinking.</P>
<P>In the du&s;k of the evening, we returned from or walk, and found our &s;upper in readine&s;s. It con&s;i&s;ted of &s;ome fi&s;h and yams, and a baked hog in which all the culinary arts of the i&s;land had been di&s;played. There being nothing to amu&s;e us after &s;upper, we lay down to &s;leep, according to the cu&s;tom of the country, on mats &s;pread upon the floor, and had a covering of cloth.
<PB N="225" REF="030274_0283_0FE56D3BCB35F6F0">
The king, who became happy with &s;ome wine and brandy which we had brought, al&s;o &s;lept in the hou&s;e, as did &s;everal others of the natives. Be|fore day-break, they all ro&s;e, and entered into conver&s;ation by moon-light. As &s;oon as it was day they di&s;per&s;ed different ways, but it was not long before they all returned, accompanied by &s;everal of their countrymen.</P>
<P>While they were preparing a bowl of <HI>kava,</HI> Captain Cook went to pay a vi&s;it to Toobou, Captain Furneaux's friend, who had a hou&s;e not far di&s;tant, which for &s;ize and neatne&s;s was hardly exceeded in the place. Here al&s;o we found a company preparing a morning draught. The cheif made a pre&s;ent to the Captain of a living hog, and one that was baked; al&s;o a quantity of yams, and a large piece of cloth. Returning to the king, we found him and his attendants drink|ing the &s;econd bowl of <HI>kava.</HI> That bu&s;ine&s;s being performed, he informed Omai that he was immediately going to perform a morning cere|mony, called <HI>tooge,</HI> in memory of a &s;on who had been &s;ome time dead, and de&s;ired us to accom|pany him. Naturally expecting to &s;ee &s;omewhat new or curious, we readily complied with the reque&s;t.</P>
<P>The king &s;tepped out of the hou&s;e, attended by two old woman, and put on a new cloathing, over which was placed an old ragged mat, which might probably have &s;erved his grandfather upon
<PB N="226" REF="030274_0284_0FE56D3D519B85C8">
a &s;imilar &s;olemn occa&s;ion. His attendants were habited in the &s;ame manner, excepting that, in point of antiquity, none of their mats could vie with that of their ma&s;ter. Thus equipped, we marched off, preceded by eight or ten per&s;ons in the &s;ame uniform, each of them having likewi&s;e a green bough about his neck. Poulaho, who held his bough in his hand till he approached the place of rendezvouz, then al&s;o put it about his neck. We now entered a &s;mall inclo&s;ure, wherein was a neat hou&s;e, and a man &s;itting be|fore it. As the company entered, they took the branches from their necks, and threw them away. The king &s;eated him&s;elf, and the others &s;at be|fore him in the u&s;ual manner. By the arrival of other per&s;ons, the circle increa&s;ed to upwards of an hundred, principally old men, all dre&s;&s;ed in the manner above de&s;cribed. The company be|ing a&s;&s;embled, a large root of <HI>kava</HI> was produced by one of the king's &s;ervants, and a capacious bowl that would contain five or &s;ix gallons. Many per&s;ons now began to chew the root, and the bowl that was filled with liquor up to the brim. Others were employed in making drinking-cups of plantain leaves. The fir&s;t cup that was filled, being pre&s;ented to the king, he ordered it to be given to another per&s;on; the &s;econd was al&s;o pre&s;ented to him, and he drank it; the third was offered to Captain Cook. Afterwards a cup was given to &s;everal others, till the liquor was
<PB N="227" REF="030274_0285_0FE56D430BDD8D48">
exhau&s;ted; and though not half the company partook of it, no one appeared in the lea&s;t di&s;&s;a|tisfied. Each cup, as it was emptied, was thrown upon the ground, whence it was taken up, and carried to be filled again. All this time the chief, and his whole circle, &s;at with a great deal of gra|vity hardly &s;peaking a &s;yllable to each other.</P>
<P>All this while we were in expectation of &s;eeing the mourning ceremony begin, when, to our great &s;urpri&s;e, as &s;oon as the kava was drank out, they all ro&s;e up and di&s;per&s;ed; and Poulaho informed us, he was now ready to attend us to the &s;hips.</P>
<P>We had &s;ometimes &s;een the drinking of kava at other i&s;lands, but no where &s;o frequently as here. The <HI>kava</HI> is a &s;pecies of pepper, which they e&s;teem a valuable article, and cultivate for this purpo&s;e, carefully defending the young plants from any injury; and it is u&s;ually planted about their hou&s;es. It does not often exceed the height of a man, though they are &s;ometimes &s;een <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> higher. It has large heart-&s;haped leaves, and jointed &s;talks.</P>
<P>Only the root of the kava is u&s;ed at the Friend|ly I&s;lands: after being dug up, it is given to the &s;ervants; who, breaking it in pieces, &s;crape the dirt off, and each chews his portion, which he afterwards &s;pits into a piece of plantain leaf. Tho&s;e, who are to prepare the liquor, collect the&s;e mouthfuls together, and depo&s;it them in a large wooden bowl, adding a &s;ufficient quantity
<PB N="228" REF="030274_0286_0FE56D44D34B06A0">
of water to make it of a proper &s;trength. It is then well mixed up with the hands, and wrung hard, in order to make it productive of as much liquid as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>About a quarter of a pint of this beverage is u&s;ually put into each cup. It has no perceptible effect upon the&s;e people, who u&s;e it &s;o frequently: but, on &s;ome of ours, it operated like our &s;pi|rits, occa&s;ioning intoxication, or rather &s;tupefac|tion.</P>
<P>The mourning ceremony being over, we left Mooa, and &s;et out on our return to the &s;hips. Rowing down the inlet, we met with two canoes returning from fi&s;hing. Poulaho ordered them to approach him, and took from them every fi&s;h and &s;hell. He afterwards &s;topped two other ca|noes, &s;earched them, and found nothing. He gave us &s;ome of the fi&s;h, and the re&s;t were &s;old by his &s;ervants on board the &s;hip. Proceeding down the inlet, we overtook a large &s;ailing canoe, when every per&s;on on board her &s;at down till we had pa&s;&s;ed; even the man who &s;teered, though he could not po&s;&s;ibly manage the helm, but in a &s;tanding po&s;ture.</P>
<P>Having been informed, by Poulaho and others, that there was &s;ome good water at Onevy, a &s;mall i&s;land, about a league off the mouth of the in|let; we landed there, in order to ta&s;te it, but found it to be extremely bracki&s;h. This i&s;land is quite in a natural &s;tate, and only frequented as a
<PB N="229" REF="030274_0287_0FE56D465CB2F068">
fi&s;hing-place; having nearly the &s;ame producti|ons as Palmer&s;ton's i&s;land.</P>
<P>When we returned to the &s;hip, Captain Cook was informed that every thing had been quiet during his ab&s;ence; not a &s;ingle theft having been committed; of which Feenou, and Futta|faihe, the king's brother, who had undertaken the management of his countrymen in the Cap|tain's ab&s;ence, boa&s;ted not a little. This evinces what power the chiefs have, when they are in|clined to execute it; which is not often to be ex|pected; for whatever was &s;tolen from us, was ge|nerally conveyed to them.</P>
<P>The next day, &s;ix or eight of the natives, a&s;|&s;aulted &s;ome of our people who were &s;awing planks; in con&s;equence of which they were fired on by the &s;entry; one of them was &s;uppo&s;ed to be wounded, and three were taken. The lat|ter were confined till night, when they were pu|ni&s;hed, and &s;et at liberty. After this their be|haviour was very decent and circum&s;pect; occa|&s;ioned, as we imagined, by the man being wound|ed: for, till this time, they had only <HI>heard</HI> of the effect of fire-arms, but now they had <HI>felt</HI> it. We were not mi&s;taken in our conjecture, for Mr. King, and Mr. Ander&s;on, in an excur&s;ion they took into the country, met with the very man, and found indubitable marks of his having been wounded with a mu&s;ket-ball.</P>
<P><PB N="230" REF="030274_0288_0FE56D47E50708D0">Nothing worthy of notice happened at the &s;hips for two days; we &s;hall therefore fill up that in|terval with an account of Mr. Ander&s;on's excur|&s;ion, above mentioned. On Monday the 30th of June, Mr. King, and he accompanied Futta|faihe as vi&s;itors to his hou&s;e, which is not far from that of his brother Poulaho, at Mooa. Soon after they arrived, a largi&s;h hog was killed, which was effected by repeated &s;trokes upon the head. The hair was then curiou&s;ly &s;craped off, with the &s;harp edge of pieces of &s;plit bamboo, and the en|trails taken out by the &s;ame &s;imple in&s;trument. Previous to this an oven had been prepared, which is a large hole dug in the earth, the bot|tom of which is covered with &s;tones, about the &s;ize of a man's fi&s;t, which are made red hot by kindling a fire over them; then they wrapt up &s;ome of the&s;e &s;tones in leaves of the bread fruit tree, with which they filled the hog's belly; &s;tuffing in a quantity of leaves to prevent their falling out, and thru&s;ting a plug of the &s;ame kind in the anus. This being done, the carca&s;e was placed upon &s;ome &s;ticks laid acro&s;s the &s;tones, and covered with plantain-leaves. The earth was afterwards dug up all round; and the oven being thus effectually clo&s;ed, the operation of baking required no farther aid.</P>
<P>They afterwards amu&s;ed them&s;elves by walking about the country, but &s;aw nothing remarkable, except a fiatooka of about thirty feet high. At a
<PB N="231" REF="030274_0289_0FE56D4E45C39DD0">
&s;mall di&s;tance, there, was a number of etooa-trees, on which were va&s;t quantities of <HI>Ternate</HI> bats, making a mo&s;t horrible noi&s;e. Not having their mu&s;kets, at this time, they could not kill any of them, but &s;ome, taken at Annamooka, mea&s;ured almo&s;t a yard, when the wings were extended.</P>
<P>On their return to Futtafaihe's hou&s;e, the bak|ed hog was produced, accompanied with &s;ome cocoa-nuts, and &s;everal ba&s;kets of baked yams. The per&s;on who prepared the hog in the morn|ing, now cut it up in a very ma&s;terly manner, with a knife made of &s;plit bamboo. Though the weight of it was at lea&s;t fifty pounds, the whole was placed before them; when they took a &s;mall part, and de&s;ired the re&s;t might be partaken of by the people &s;itting round. Fattafaihe could hardly be prevailed upon to eat a mor&s;el.</P>
<P>Dinner being ended, they went, with him, and his attendants, towards the &s;pot where Poulaho's mourning-ceremony was performed. They &s;aw nothing but a kind of continuation of the &s;ame &s;olemn rites, by way of condolence. Upon en|quiring upon who&s;e account it was now tran&s;|acted, they were informed, that it was in me|mory of a chief who had long &s;ince died at Va|vaoo, that they had practi&s;ed it ever &s;ince, and &s;hould continue to do &s;o for a con&s;iderable length of time to come.</P>
<P><PB N="232" REF="030274_0290_0FE56D501CAD5EA0">They were entertained in the evening, with a pig for &s;upper, dre&s;&s;ed like the hog, and, like that accompanied with yams and cocoa-nuts. When the &s;upper was over, a large quantity of cloth was brought for them to &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eep in; but they were di&s;turbed in their repo&s;e, by a &s;ingular in|&s;tance of luxury, in which their men of con&s;e|quence indulge them&s;elves; that of being thump|ed or beat while they are a&s;leep. Two women, who &s;at by Futtafaihe, performed this operation, which they call <HI>tooge tooge,</HI> by &s;triking his body and legs, with both fi&s;ts, till he fell a&s;leep, and, with &s;ome intervals, continued it the whole night. The per&s;on being fa&s;t a&s;leep, they abate a little of the &s;trength and bri&s;kne&s;s of the beating; but, if they ob&s;erve any appearance of his awak|ing, they re&s;ume it. In the morning they were informed, that Futtafaihe's women relieved each other, and went alternately to &s;leep. Such a practi&s;e as this in any other country, would be &s;uppo&s;ed to be de&s;tructive of all re&s;t; but here it operates like an opiate, and &s;trongly &s;hews what habit may effect.</P>
<P>They &s;et out with Futtafaihe the next morn|ing, and walked to the point, down the ea&s;t-&s;ide of the bay. The country all along this &s;ide ap|peared to be well cultivated, but not &s;o much inclo&s;ed as at Mooa. They found, that, in tra|velling, Futtafaihe exerci&s;ed a power, which &s;hewed the great authority the principal men are
<PB N="233" REF="030274_0291_0FE56D51A61DE770">
inve&s;ted with. To one place, he &s;ent for fi&s;h; and to another, for yams; and his orders were as rea|dily obeyed, as if he had been ab&s;olute ma&s;ter of all the people's property.</P>
<P>They cro&s;&s;ed the bay, in the evening, to their &s;tation, in a canoe procured by Futtafaihe, by exerci&s;ing his authority in calling to the fir&s;t that appeared; he had al&s;o a large hog at this place, and wanted them to accept of a bundle of cloth; but, the boat being &s;mall, they objected; and he ordered it to be taken to them the next day. Thus ends Mr. Ander&s;on's account of his ex|cur&s;ion.</P>
<P>Captain Cook had prolonged his &s;tay at this i&s;land, on account of the approaching eclip&s;e; but, on looking at the micrometer, (on the 2d of July) he found &s;ome accident had happened to it, and that it was rendered u&s;ele&s;s, till re|paired; which could not be done before the time it was intended to be u&s;ed. We therefore got on board, this day, all the cattle and other ani|mals, except tho&s;e that were de&s;tined to remain. The Captain de&s;igned to have left a turkey-cock and hen, but two hens being de&s;troyed by acci|dent, and wi&s;hing to carry the breed to Otaheite, he re&s;erved the only remaining pair for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>We took up our anchor the next day, and moved the &s;hips behind Pangimodoo, to be ready for the fir&s;t favourable wind to take us through
<PB N="234" REF="030274_0292_0FE56D53A48A9D40">
the narrows. The king, who this day dined with us, took particular notice of the plates; which the Commodore ob&s;erving, made him an offer of one, either of pewter, or of earthen ware. He made choice of the fir&s;t, and mentioned the &s;everal u&s;es to which he intended to apply it; two of which were &s;o very extraordinary that they de&s;erve to be related.</P>
<P>Whenever he &s;hould vi&s;it any of the other i&s;lands, he &s;aid he would leave this plate behind him at Tongataboo, as his repre&s;entative, that the people might in his ab&s;ence, pay it the ho|mage due to him&s;elf in per&s;on. On being a&s;ked, how he had u&s;ually been repre&s;ented in his ab|&s;ence, before he was in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this plate, he informed us, that this &s;ingular honour had always been conferred on a wooden bowl, in which he wa&s;hed his hands. The other u&s;e to which he meant to apply the plate in&s;tead of the bowl, was to di&s;cover a thief. When any thing had been &s;tolen, and the thief not detected, the people were a&s;&s;embled before him, when he wa&s;h|ed his hands in this ve&s;&s;el. After this it was cleaned, and every man advanced, and touched it with his hand, in the &s;ame manner that they touch his foot when they offer him obei&s;ance. If touched by the guilty per&s;on, he dropped down dead immediately; and, if any one refu&s;ed to touch, it, &s;uch refu&s;al was con&s;idered as a &s;ufficient proof of his guilt.</P>
<P><PB N="235" REF="030274_0293_0FE56D58CF08E850">In the morning of Saturday the 5th of July, the day of the eclip&s;e, the weather was cloudy, with &s;ome &s;howers of rain. About nine o'clock, the &s;un broke out at &s;mall intervals for about half an hour, but was totally ob&s;cured ju&s;t be|fore the beginning of the eclip&s;e. The &s;un again appeared at intervals till about the middle of the eclip&s;e; but was &s;een no more during the remainder of the day, &s;o that we could not ob|&s;erve the end. This di&s;appointment was the le&s;s to be lamented, as the longitude was &s;ufficiently determined by lunar ob&s;ervations.</P>
<P>The eclip&s;e being over, we packed up the in|&s;truments, and every thing was conveyed on board. None of the natives having taken any care of the three &s;heep allotted to Mareewagee, the Commodore ordered them to be carried back to the &s;hips. He was apprehen&s;ive that, if they had been left there, they would probably be de|&s;troyed by dogs. The&s;e animals did not exi&s;t upon the i&s;land in 1773, when the Commodore fir&s;t vi&s;ited it; but there is now a plenty of them; partly from the breed left by him, and partly from &s;ome imported from an i&s;land, called <HI>Feejee.</HI> At pre&s;ent, however, the dogs have not got into any of the Friendly I&s;lands, except Tongataboo.</P>
<P>Mr. Ander&s;on has given us the following de|&s;cription of this i&s;land. Am&s;terdam, Tonga|taboo, or Tonga (as it is &s;ometimes called by the natives) is about twenty leagues in circum|ference,
<PB N="236" REF="030274_0294_0FE56D5A600D2F58">
rather oblong, though broade&s;t at the ea&s;t-end, and its greate&s;t length is from ea&s;t to we&s;t. The &s;outh-&s;hore is &s;traight, con&s;i&s;ting of coral-rocks of about eight or ten feet high, ter|minating perpendicularly, except in &s;ome few places, where there are &s;andy beach<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&punc; The we&s;t-end is about five or &s;ix miles broad, and has a &s;hore like that of the &s;outh-&s;ide; but the north-&s;ide is environed with &s;hoals and i&s;lands; and the ea&s;t &s;ide is, mo&s;t probably, like the &s;outh.</P>
<P>This i&s;land may, with propriety, be called a low one; the only eminent part, to be ob&s;erved from a &s;hip, is the &s;outh-ea&s;t point, though many gently ri&s;ing and declining grounds are perceiv|able by tho&s;e who are on &s;hore. Though the general appearance of the country does not ex|hibit that beautiful kind of land&s;cape, produced by a variety of hills and valleys, rivulets, and lawns, yet it conveys an idea of the mo&s;t exu|berant fertility. The &s;urface, at a di&s;tance, &s;eems entirely clothed with trees of various &s;izes: but the tall cocoa-palms rai&s;e their tufted heads high above the re&s;t, and are a noble ornament to any country that produces them. The boogo, which is a &s;pecies of the fig, is the large&s;t &s;ized tree upon the i&s;land: and the mo&s;t common bu&s;hes and &s;mall trees, on the uncultivated &s;pots, are the pandanus, the faitanoo, &s;everal &s;orts of hi|bi&s;cus, and a few others.</P>
<P><PB N="237" REF="030274_0295_0FE56D5BE7422008">The climate of Tongataboo, from the &s;itua|tion towards the tropic, is more variable than in countries far within that line; though that might, perhaps, be occa&s;ioned by the &s;ea&s;on of the year which was now the winter &s;ol&s;tice. The winds are generally from &s;ome point between &s;outh and ea&s;t. The wind, indeed, &s;ometimes veers to the north-ea&s;t, or even north-we&s;t, but never conti|nues long, nor blows &s;trong from thence, though often accompanied by heavy rain, and clo&s;e &s;ul|try weather.</P>
<P>The vegetable productions are never &s;o much affected, re&s;pecting the foliage, as to &s;hed it all at once; but every leaf, as it falls, is &s;ucceded by another, which cau&s;es the appearanee of univer|&s;al &s;pring.</P>
<P>A coral rock appears to be the ba&s;is of the i&s;land, that being the only &s;ort that pre&s;ents it&s;elf on the &s;hore. There was not the appearance of any other &s;tone, except &s;ome &s;mall blue pebbles about the <HI>fiatookas</HI> and the &s;mooth black &s;tone, of which the natives make their hatchets; and the&s;e have, perhaps, been brought from other i&s;lands in the neighbourhood. Though, in many places, the coral projects above the &s;urface, the &s;oil is, in mo&s;t parts, of a con&s;iderable depth. In cultivated places, it is generally of a loo&s;e black colour, &s;eemingly produced by the rotten vegetables.</P>
<P><PB N="238" REF="030274_0296_0FE56D5DC65BB750">The principal of the cultivated fruits in this i&s;land, are plantains, of which they have fifteen varieties; the jambu, and the eeevee: the latter being a kind of plum; and va&s;t quantities of &s;haddocks, as often found in a natural &s;tate as planted.</P>
<P>Of yams there are two &s;orts; one black and &s;o large as to weigh from twenty to thirty pounds; the other white and long, &s;eldom exceeding a pound in weight. There is a large root, called kappe; another like our white potatoes, called mawhaha; the tal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, and the jeejee.</P>
<P>They have va&s;t numbers of cocoa-nut-trees, and three other &s;orts of palms. One is called beeoo, growing almo&s;t as high as the cocoa-tree, and having very large leaves plaited like a fan. The other is a kind of cabbage-tree, much re&s;em|bling the cocoa, but rather thicker. A third &s;ort is called ongo ongo; it &s;eldom grows higher than five or &s;ix feet. Plenty of excellent &s;ugar|cane is cultivated here; al&s;o gourds, bamboo, turmeric, and a &s;pecies of fig, called matte; but the catalogue of uncultivated plants is too large to be enumerated.</P>
<P>There are no quadrupeds in this i&s;land, but hogs, dogs, and a few rats. Fowls of a large breed, are dome&s;ticated here.</P>
<P>Among the birds, are parrots, and parroquets, cuckoos, king-fi&s;hers, and a bird of the thru&s;h kind, of a dull green colour, which is the only
<PB N="239" REF="030274_0297_0FE56D61A0B421A0">
&s;inging-bird we could find here; but it compen|&s;ates, in a great degree, for the want of others, by the force and melody of its voice.</P>
<P>Among the other land birds are rails about the &s;ize of a pigeon, of a variegated grey colour; a black &s;ort with reddi&s;h eyes: large violet coots, with red bald crowns; two &s;orts of fly-catchers; a &s;mall &s;wallow; and three &s;orts of pidgeons.</P>
<P>Of water-fowl, are the ducks &s;een at Anna|mooka; tropic birds; blue and white herons; noddies; white terns; a new &s;pecies of a leaden colour; a &s;mall blui&s;h curlew; and a large &s;pot|ted plover.</P>
<P>Among the animals of the reptile, or in&s;ect tribe, are &s;ea &s;nakes, (though often &s;een on &s;hore) about three feet long, with alternate black and white circles; &s;ome &s;corpions, and centipedes; al&s;o green guanoes, about eighteen inches long, and two &s;maller &s;orts. Here are &s;ome beautiful moths and butterflies, and &s;ome very large &s;pi|ders; together with others, making in the whole, about fifty different &s;orts of in&s;ects.</P>
<P>Though the &s;ea abounds with fi&s;h, the variety is le&s;s than might be imagined: tho&s;e in the greate&s;t plenty are mullets, &s;ilver fi&s;h, old wives, parrot fi&s;h, &s;oles, leather jackets, albicores, bon|netos, eels like tho&s;e about Palmer&s;ton's I&s;land, rays, a &s;ort of pike, and &s;ome devil fi&s;h.</P>
<P>There are an endle&s;s variety of &s;hell fi&s;h about the reefs and &s;hoals; among which are the ham|mer

</ARGUMENT>
<P>THOUGH we were now ready to &s;ail, we had not &s;ufficient day-light to turn through the narrows; the morning flood falling out too early and the evening flood too late. We were therefore under a nece&s;&s;ity of waiting two or three days, unle&s;s we &s;hould be fortunate enough to have a leading wind.</P>
<P><PB N="241" REF="030274_0299_0FE56D65154FB428">This delay gave us an opportunity to be pre|&s;ent at a public &s;olemnity, to which the king had invited us, and which was to be performed on the 8th. He and all the people of con&s;equence re|paired to Mooa on the 7th, where the &s;olemnity was to be exhibited. Several of us followed them the next morning. Poulaho had informed us, that his &s;on was now to be initiated into cer|tain privileges; one of which was, that of eating with his father; an honour he had not hitherto enjoyed.</P>
<P>About eight o'clock in the morning we ar|rived at Mooa, where we found the king, with a number of attendants &s;itting before him, within a &s;mall dirty enclo&s;ure. They were, as u&s;ual, bu|&s;ied in preparing a bowl of <HI>kava.</HI> As this was not liquor for us, we went to pay a vi&s;it to &s;ome of our friends, and to ob&s;erve what preparations were making for the ceremony, which was &s;oon expected to begin.</P>
<P>About ten o'clock, the people a&s;&s;embled in a large area before the <HI>malace,</HI> or great hou&s;e. At the end of a road, opening into this area, &s;tood &s;everal men with &s;pears and clubs, ince&s;&s;antly reciting &s;hort &s;entences, in mournful accents, which conveyed an idea of di&s;tre&s;s. This was contined about an hour; during which time, many people came down the road, each having a yam tied to the middle of a pole, which they laid down before tho&s;e who continued repeating
<PB N="242" REF="030274_0300_0FE56D66E84908B8">
the &s;entences. At length, the king and prince ar|rived, and &s;eated them&s;elves upon the area; and we were reque&s;ted to &s;it down by them, to take off out hats and to untie our hair. The bea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|ers of the yams having all entered, each pole was taken up between two men, who carried it over their &s;houlders. They afterwards formed them&s;elves into companies, of ten or twelve each, and marched acro&s;s the place, with a rapid pace, each company headed by a man who had a club or &s;pear, and defended, on the right, by &s;everal others, armed with different weapons. About two hundred and fifty per&s;ons walked in the pro|ce&s;&s;ion, which was clo&s;ed by a man carrying on a perch a living pigeon.</P>
<P>Omai was de&s;ired by Captain Cook to a&s;k the chief where the yams were to be carried, with &s;o much &s;olemnity; but he &s;eemed unwilling to give us the information we required; &s;ome of us, therefore, followed the proce&s;&s;ion, &s;eemingly con|trary to his inclination.</P>
<P>They &s;topped before a <HI>morai</HI> or <HI>fiatooka</HI> of one hou&s;e &s;tanding upon a mount, about a quarter of a mile from where they fir&s;t a&s;&s;embled. Here they depo&s;ited the yams, and gathered them into bundles; but for what purpo&s;e, we could not po&s;|&s;ibly learn. Our pre&s;ence &s;eeming to give them offence or unea&s;ine&s;s, we quitted them, and re|turned to Poulaho, who advi&s;ed us to amu&s;e our&s;elves by walking about, as nothing would be

done for a con&s;iderable time. The fear of lo&s;ing the &s;ight of any part of the ceremony prevented our being long ab&s;ent. When we returned to the king, he de&s;ired Captain Cook to order the boat's crew not to pre&s;ume to &s;tir from the boat, for every thing would, very &s;oon, be <HI>taboo</HI>; and if any of our people, or of there own, &s;hould be &s;een walking about, they would certainly be knocked down with clubs; nay <HI>mateed,</HI> that is, killed. He al&s;o informed us that we could not be pre&s;ent at the ceremony; but that we &s;hould be placed in &s;uch a &s;ituation, as to be able to &s;ee every thing that pa&s;&s;ed. Our dre&s;s was particu|larly objected to, and we were told, that, to qualify us to be pre&s;ent, we mu&s;t be naked as low as the brea&s;t, and our hats mu&s;t be taken off and our hair untied. Omai readily agreed to conform to the&s;e requi&s;ites, and immediately began to &s;trip; but other objections were then &s;tarted, and he was excluded equally with our|&s;elves.</P>
<P>Not reli&s;hing this re&s;triction, the Captain &s;tole out, to &s;ee what might now be going forward. Very few people, however, were to be &s;een, ex|cept tho&s;e who were dre&s;&s;ed to attend the cere|money; &s;ome having in their hands &s;mall poles, about four feet in length, to the under part of which were fa&s;tened two or three other &s;mall &s;ticks, about &s;ix inches long. The&s;e men were going towards the <HI>morai.</HI> Captain Cook took the &s;ame
<PB N="244" REF="030274_0303_0FE56D7036DC5F60">
road, and was frequently &s;topped by them, all crying out <HI>taboo.</HI> However, he ventured to go forward till he came in &s;ight of the <HI>morai,</HI> and of the people &s;itting before it. He was now &s;trong|ly urged to go back, and, not knowing what might be the con&s;equence of a refu&s;al, he com|plied. He had ob&s;erved, that tho&s;e who carried the poles, pa&s;&s;ed the <HI>morai</HI>; and gue&s;&s;ing, from this circum&s;tance, that &s;omething was tran&s;acting beyond it, he had &s;ome thoughts of advancing, by making a round for this purpo&s;e; but he was &s;o narrowly ob&s;erved by three men, that he had no opportunity of putting his de&s;ign in execu|tion. In order to &s;hake off the&s;e fellows, he re|turned to the <HI>malaoo,</HI> where he had parted from the king, and afterwards made an elopement a &s;econd time; but he in&s;tantly met with the &s;ame three men, who had doubtle&s;s received in&s;truc|tions to watch him. He paid no attention to them, till he came within &s;ight of the king's principal <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">atooka</HI> or <HI>morai</HI>; before which a great number of people were &s;itting, being tho&s;e whom he had ju&s;t before &s;een pa&s;s by the other <HI>morai,</HI> from which this was but a little di&s;tant. Seeing that he could ob&s;erve the proceedings of this com|pany from the king's plantation, he repaired thi|ther, accompanied by &s;everal of his people.</P>
<P>The number of per&s;ons at the <HI>fiatooka</HI> con|tinued increa&s;ing for &s;ome time, and at length they quitted their &s;itting po&s;ture, and marched
<PB N="245" REF="030274_0304_0FE56D71DE9B1540">
off in proce&s;&s;ion. They walked in pairs, every pair carrying between them, one of the &s;mall poles on their &s;houlders. We were informed, that the &s;mall pieces of &s;ticks fa&s;tened to the poles, were yams; it is therefore probable, that they were meant to repre&s;ent this root emblemati|cally. The hindmo&s;t man of each couple placed one of his hands to the middle of the pole, as if it were not &s;trong enough to carry the weight that hung to it, and under which they all &s;eemed to bend, as they proceeded. This proce&s;&s;ion con&s;i&s;ted of one hundred and eight pairs, and principally men of rank.</P>
<P>Having &s;een them all pa&s;s, we repaired to Poulaho's hou&s;e, and &s;aw him going out. We were not permitted to follow him; but were im|mediately conducted to the place allotted to us, behind a fence adjoining to the area of the <HI>fiatooka</HI> where the yams had been depo&s;ited in the morn|ing.</P>
<P>Arriving at our &s;tation, we &s;aw two or three hundred people &s;itting on the gra&s;s, near the end of the road opening into the area of the <HI>morai</HI>; and others were continually joining them. At length, arrived a few men, each carrying &s;ome &s;mall poles and branches, or leaves of the cocoa|nut tree. As &s;oon as they appeared, an old man &s;eated him&s;elf in the road, and pronounced a long oration in a &s;erious maje&s;tic tone. He then retired, and the others advancing to the middle
<PB N="246" REF="030274_0305_0FE56D8CE067C2D8">
of the area, began to erect a &s;mall &s;hed or hut; employing, for that purpo&s;e&punc; the materials al|ready mentioned. Their work being fini&s;hed, they all &s;quatted down, for a moment, before it, then ro&s;e up and joined the re&s;t of the company. Poulaho's &s;on arrived &s;oon after, preceded by four or five men. After them appeared about twelve or fourteen women of the fir&s;t rank, ad|vancing &s;lowly in pairs, each pair carrying be|tween them a narrow piece of white cloth, about two or three yards in length. They approached the prince, &s;quatted down before him, and wrap|ped &s;ome of the pieces of the cloth round his body; they then ro&s;e up and retired in the &s;ame order, to &s;ome di&s;tance on his left, where they &s;eated them&s;elves. Poulaho now made his ap|pearance, preceded by four men, walking two and two abrea&s;t, and &s;at down on his &s;on's left hand, at a &s;mall di&s;tance from him. The young prince then quitted his fir&s;t po&s;ition, and &s;eated him&s;elf under the &s;hed, with his attendants; many others placed them&s;elves on the gra&s;s be|fore this royal canopy. The prince &s;at facing the people, with his back to the <HI>morai.</HI> Three companies, of about ten or a dozen men in each, &s;tarted up from among the crowd, &s;oon after each other, and, running ha&s;tily to the oppo&s;ite &s;ide, &s;at down for a few &s;econds; and then re|turned, in the &s;ame manner, to their former &s;ta|tions. To them &s;ucceeded two men, each hav|ing
<PB N="247" REF="030274_0306_0FE56D8E68797728">
a &s;mall green branch in his hand, who ro&s;e and advanced towards the prince, &s;itting down, for a few &s;econds, three different times, as they approached; and retired in the &s;ame manner, in|clining there branches to each other as they &s;at. Afterwards two others repeated the &s;ame cere|mony.</P>
<P>The grand proce&s;&s;ion, which marched from the other <HI>morai,</HI> now began to come in. As they entered the area, they proceeded to the right of the &s;hed, and having pro&s;trated them&s;elves on the gra&s;s, depo&s;ited their pretended heavy bur|thens (the poles), and faced round to the prince. They then ro&s;e up, and retired in the &s;ame or|der, clo&s;ing their hands with the mo&s;t &s;erious a&s;|pect, and &s;eated them&s;elves along the front of the area. While this numerous band where en|tering, and depo&s;iting their poles, three men who &s;at with the prince continued pronouncing &s;eparate &s;entences, in a mournful melancholy tone.</P>
<P>A profound &s;ilence then en&s;ued for a &s;hort time, after which a man who &s;at in the front of the area, began a kind of oration, during which, at &s;everal different times, he broke one of the poles which had been brought in. Having concluded his oration, the people, &s;itting before the &s;hed &s;eparated to make a lane through which the prince and his attendants pa&s;&s;ed, and the a&s;&s;em|bly clo&s;ed.</P>
<P><PB N="248" REF="030274_0307_0FE56D90B3455208">Satisfied with what they had already &s;een, &s;ome of our party now returned to the &s;hips; but Cap|tain Cook, and &s;ome more of the officers, re|mained at Mooa, to &s;ee the conclu&s;ion of the &s;o|lemnity, which was not to be till the day follow|ing. The &s;mall poles, which had been brought by tho&s;e who walked in proce&s;&s;ion, being left on the ground, after the crowd had di&s;per&s;ed, the Commodore examined them, and found that, to the middle of each, two or three &s;mall &s;ticks were tied, as has been related. They were pro|bably intended as only artificial repre&s;entations of &s;mall yams.</P>
<P>Our &s;upper, con&s;i&s;ting of fi&s;h and yams, was got ready about &s;even o'clock. The king &s;up|ped with us and drank &s;o freely of brandy and water, that he retired to bed with a &s;ufficient do&s;e. We continued the whole night in the &s;ame hou&s;e with him and his attendants.</P>
<P>All, except Poulaho him&s;elf, ro&s;e at day-break; &s;oon after which, a woman, one of tho&s;e who gennerally attended upon the chief, came in, and, &s;itting down by him, immediately began the &s;ame operation which had been practi&s;ed upon Futta|faihe, tapping or beating gently, with her clinch|ed fi&s;ts, on his thighs. This, in&s;tead of adding to his repo&s;e, had the contrary effect, and he awoke.</P>
<P>Captain Cook and Omai now paid a vi&s;it to the prince, who had parted from us early the
<PB N="249" REF="030274_0308_0FE56D974B9C2B00">
preceding evening; for he did not lodge with the king, but in apartments of his own, at &s;ome di&s;tance from his father's hou&s;e. We found him with a circle of boys, about his own age, &s;itting before him; and an old man and woman. There were others, of both &s;exes, employed, about their nece&s;&s;ary affairs, who, probably, belonged to his hou&s;hold.</P>
<P>We then returned to the king, who had a crowded levee before him, con&s;i&s;ting principally of old men. While a bowl of <HI>kava</HI> was pre|paring, a baked hog and yams, &s;moking hot, were introduced; the greate&s;t part of which fell to our &s;hare, for th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e people, e&s;pecially the <HI>kava</HI> drinkers, eat very little in a morning.</P>
<P>We afterwards walked out, and vi&s;ited &s;everal other chiefs; all of whom were taking their morning draught, or they had already taken it. Returning to the king, we found him a&s;leep in a retired hut, with two women tapping or &s;trik|ing on his breech. About eleven o'clock he aro&s;e again, and ate &s;ome fi&s;h and yams, and again lay down to &s;leep. We now left him, and waited on the prince, with a pre&s;ent of cloth beads, and other articles. There was a &s;ufficient quantity of cloth to make him a complete &s;uit, and he was immediately clad in his new habili|ments. Proud of his dre&s;s, he fir&s;t went to ex|hibit him&s;elf to his father, and then conducted Captain Cook to his mother, with whom were
<PB N="250" REF="030274_0309_0FE56D98D4366488">
about a dozen other women of a very re&s;pectable appearance. Here the prince changed his ap|parel, and made Captain Cook a pre&s;ent of two pieces of the cloth which had been manufactured in the i&s;land.</P>
<P>It was now about noon, when, by appoint|ment, the Captain repaired to the palace to din|ner; which was &s;oon after &s;erved up, and con|&s;i&s;ted of two pigs and &s;ome yams. The drow&s;y monarch was rouzed to partake of what he had appointed, for our entertainment. Two mullets, and &s;ome &s;hell-fi&s;h, were introduced, as if in|tended for his &s;eparate portion. But he added it to our fare, &s;at down with us, and made a very hearty meal.</P>
<P>Dinner being over, we were informed that the ceremony would &s;oon begin, and were &s;trictly enjoined not to venture out. The Commodore had re&s;olved, however, to peep no longer from behind the curtain, but, if po&s;&s;ible to mix with the actors them&s;elves. With this view he walk|ed towards the <HI>morai,</HI> the &s;cene of the &s;olemnity. He was frequently de&s;ired to return, but he paid no regard to the admonitions he received, and was permitted to pa&s;s on. When arrived at the <HI>morai,</HI> he &s;aw a number of men &s;eated on the &s;ide of the area. A few were al&s;o &s;itting on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide, and two men in the middle, with their faces turned to the <HI>morai.</HI> When Captain Cook had got into the mid&s;t of the fir&s;t com|pany,
<PB N="251" REF="030274_0310_0FE56D9A5E1314D8">
he was de&s;ired to &s;it down, which he ac|cordingly did. Where he &s;at, there were lying a number of &s;mall bundles, compo&s;ed of cocoa-nut leaves, and fa&s;tened to &s;ticks made into the form of hand-borrows. All the information he could get concerning them was, that they were <HI>taboo.</HI> From time to time, one or another of the company turned to tho&s;e who were coming to join us, and made a &s;hort &s;peech, in which we remarked, that the word <HI>arekee</HI> (king) was generally mentioned. Something was &s;aid by one man that produced loud bur&s;ts of laughter from all around; others, of the &s;peakers, were al&s;o much applauded. The Captain was fre|quently de&s;ired to leave the place; but at length, finding him determined to &s;tay, they reque&s;ted him to uncover his &s;houlders as theirs were. This he readily complied with, and then they no longer &s;eemed unea&s;y at his pre&s;ence.</P>
<P>The prince, the woman, and the king, at length appeared, as they had done the preceding day. The prince being placed under the &s;hed, two men, each with a piece of mat, came, re|peating &s;omething in a very &s;erious &s;train, and put them about him. The people now began their operations, and different companies ran backward and forward acro&s;s the area, as in the former day. Pre&s;ently afterwards, the two men, in the middle of the area, made a &s;hort &s;peech, and then the whole company ro&s;e up and placed
<PB N="252" REF="030274_0311_0FE56D9C04CEA6E0">
them&s;elves before the &s;hed in which the prince, and three or four men were &s;eated. One of the company who &s;eemed very de&s;irous of obliging Captain Cook, procured him &s;uch a &s;ituation, that if he could have made u&s;e of his eyes, nothing could have e&s;caped him. But it was nece&s;&s;ary to have a demure countenance and downca&s;t looks.</P>
<P>The proce&s;&s;ion &s;oon after arrived as on the preceding day; a pole, with a cocoa-nut leaf plaited round the middle of it being carried on the &s;houlders of every two per&s;ons. The&s;e were depo&s;ited with the &s;ame ceremonies as on the day before. After this &s;ucceeded another pro|ce&s;&s;ion, compo&s;ed of men who brought ba&s;kets, made of palm-leaves, &s;uch as are generally u&s;ed by this people to carry provi&s;ions in. A third proce&s;&s;ion followed, in which a variety of &s;mall fi&s;h, each placed at the end of a forked &s;tick, were brought. An old man, who &s;at on the prince's right-hand, without the &s;hed, received the ba&s;kets; each of which he kept in his hand, making a &s;hort &s;peech or prayer; then laying that a&s;ide, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> called for another, repeating the &s;ame kind of prayer; he proceeded in this manner till he had gone through the whole number of ba&s;kets. Two men, who, till this time, had in their hands green branches, and were &s;eated on the left, received the fi&s;h one by one, as they were pre&s;ented to them on the forked &s;ticks. The
<PB N="253" REF="030274_0312_0FE56D76AF4205C0">
fir&s;t fi&s;h they laid down on their right, and the &s;econd on their left. The third being pre&s;ented, a &s;touti&s;h man, who was &s;eated behind the other two, endeavoured to &s;eize it, as did al&s;o the other two at the &s;ame time. Thus every fi&s;h was con|tended for; but the man behind, on account of his di&s;advantageous &s;ituation, got only pieces; for he never quitted his hold till the fi&s;h was torn out of his hand. What the others got, were laid on the right and left. At la&s;t the per&s;on behind got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a whole fi&s;h, the other two not even touching it. Upon this, the word <HI>mareeai</HI> (very good) was pronunced in a low voice throughout the whole crowd. It appeared, that he had now done all that was expected from him; for he did not contend for the other fi&s;h. The per&s;ons who brought in the&s;e ba&s;kets and fi&s;h, delivered them &s;itting; and in the &s;ame manner, the poles, carried in the fir&s;t proce&s;&s;ion, had been placed upon the ground. At the clo&s;e of the la&s;t proce&s;&s;ion, there was &s;ome &s;peaking or praying by different per&s;ons. Then, on a &s;ig|nal being given, we all ro&s;e up, ran &s;everal paces, and &s;at down, with our backs to the prince. The Commodore was reque&s;ted not to look behind him; but he was not di&s;couraged by this in|junction, from facing about. The prince had now turned his face to the <HI>morai,</HI> and from that moment he was admitted to the honour of eating with his father; and a piece of roa&s;t|ed
<PB N="254" REF="030274_0313_0FE56D7924021038">
yam was pre&s;ented to each of them for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Soon after, we all turned about, forming a kind of &s;emicircle before the prince, and leaving an open &s;pace between us. Pre&s;ently &s;ome men ad|vanced towards us, two and two, bearing large poles upon their &s;houlders, waving their hands as they proceeded, and making a noi&s;e like &s;ing|ing. When they came near us, they made a &s;hew of walking quick, without advancing a &s;in|gle &s;tep. Several men, armed with large &s;ticks, immediately &s;tarted from the crowd, and ran to|wards the new vi&s;itors, but they in&s;tantly made off having thrown down the poles from their &s;houlders. The others attacked the poles, and having beat them mo&s;t unmercifully, returned to their places. The former, as they ran off, gave the challenge u&s;ed here in wre&s;tling; and, in a &s;hort time, &s;ome lu&s;ty fellows came from the &s;ame quarter, repeating the challenge as they approached. The&s;e were re&s;i&s;ted by a company, who arrived at that in&s;tant from the oppo&s;ite &s;ide. Both parties, however, returned to their own quarter, after having paraded about the area for &s;ome minutes. Afterwards, for the &s;pace of half an hour, wre&s;tling and boxing-matches &s;ucceeed|ed. Speeches were then delivered by two men, who &s;eated them&s;elves before the prince, with which the &s;olemnity ended, and the whole a&s;|&s;embly broke up.</P>
<P><PB N="255" REF="030274_0314_0FE56D7AAB43A730">In vain did we endeavour to find out the pur|port of the &s;olemnity, called <HI>Natche.</HI> All the an&s;wer we received to our enquiries, was <HI>taboo</HI>; which as has been already ob&s;erved, is applied to many things. There was a my&s;terious &s;olem|nity in the whole tran&s;action; and from the manner of performing it, as well as the place where it was performed, it was evident, that there was a mixture of religion in the in&s;titution. Upon no occa&s;ion had they regarded our dre&s;s and deportment; but now it was required, that our hair &s;hould &s;low about our &s;houlders; that we &s;hould be uncovered to the wai&s;t; &s;it cro&s;s-legged; and have our hands locked together. It &s;hould be ob&s;erved al&s;o that none but the chief people and tho&s;e who were concerned in the ce|remony, were admitted to a&s;&s;i&s;t in the cele|bration of it. All the&s;e circum&s;tances evidently pointed out that they &s;uppo&s;ed them&s;elves acting under the in&s;pection of a Supreme Being, upon this occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>From the above account of the pre&s;ent <HI>Natche,</HI> it may be con&s;idered as merely figurative. The few yams, which were &s;een the fir&s;t day, could not be meant as a general contribution; and it was intimated to us, that they were a portion con&s;e|crated to the <HI>Otooa,</HI> or Divinity.</P>
<P>We were however, informed that, in the &s;pace of three months, there would be repre&s;ented a more important &s;olemnity; on which occa&s;ion,
<PB N="256" REF="030274_0315_0FE56D7C87495B40">
the tribute of Tongataboo, Hapaee, Vavaoo, and all the other i&s;lands, would be brought to the chief, and more awfully confirmed, by &s;acri|ficing ten human victims from among&s;t the peo|ple. A horrid &s;olemnity indeed! On our en|quiring into the occa&s;ion of &s;o barbarous a prac|tice, we were informed, that it was a nece&s;&s;ary part of the Natche; and that, if omitted, the Deity would de&s;troy their king.</P>
<P>The day was far &s;pent, before the breaking up of the a&s;&s;embly; and as we were at &s;ome di&s;tance from the &s;hips, we were impatient to &s;et out from Mooa. Taking leave of Poulaho, he pre&s;&s;ed us earne&s;tly to &s;tay till the next day, in order to be pre&s;ent at a funeral ceremony. The wife of Mareewagee, his mother-in-law, had lately died: and, on account of the Natche, her corps had been carried on board a canoe in the <HI>lagoon.</HI> Poulaho told Captain Cook, that when he had paid the la&s;t offices to her, he would attend him to Eooa; but if he did not chu&s;e to wait, that he would follow him thither. He would gladly have &s;een this ceremony, had not the tide been now favourable. The wind too, which had been very boi&s;terous, was now moderate and &s;ettled. Be|&s;ides, we were informed that the funeral cere|monies would continue five days, which, as the &s;hips lay in &s;uch a &s;ituation, that we could not get to &s;ea at plea&s;ure, was too long a time to &s;tay. The Captain, however, a&s;&s;ured the king, that if
<PB N="257" REF="030274_0316_0FE56D8093F29528">
he did not immediately &s;ail, he would vi&s;it him again the next day. Whereupon we all took leave of him, and arrived at our &s;hips about eight o'clock in the evening.</P>
<P>While the Commodore was attending the <HI>Natche,</HI> at Mooa, he ordered the hor&s;es, bull, and other cattle, to be brought thither, thinking they would be &s;afer there, than at a place that would be, in a great mea&s;ure, de&s;erted, the mo|ment after our departure. Be&s;ides, we had left with our friends here, a young Engli&s;h boar, and three young Engli&s;h &s;ows. They were exceed|ingly de&s;irous of them, naturally &s;uppo&s;ing that they would greatly improve their own breed, which is but &s;mall. Feenou al&s;o got two rabbits from us, a buck and doe, from which young ones were produced before we &s;ailed. If the cattle &s;ucceed, the acqui&s;ition to the&s;e i&s;lands will be great; and as Tongataboo is a fine level country, the hor&s;es will be extremely u&s;eful.</P>
<P>We weighed anchor on the 10th, about eight o'clock in the morning, and, with a &s;teady gale, turned through the channel, between the &s;mall i&s;les called Makkahaa and Monooafai. The flood, at fir&s;t, &s;et &s;trong in our favour, till lead|ing up to the <HI>lagoon,</HI> where the ea&s;tward flood meets that from the we&s;t. This, with the in|draught of the <HI>lagoon,</HI> and of the &s;hoals before it, occa&s;ions, &s;trong riplings and whirlp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ols. Be|&s;ides the&s;e di&s;advantages, the depth of the chan|nel
<PB N="258" REF="030274_0317_0FE56D82A23AB9D0">
exceeds the length of a cable; con&s;equently there can be no anchorage, except clo&s;e to the rocks, in forty and forty-five fathoms water, where a &s;hip would be expo&s;ed to the whirlpools. The Captain, therefore, abandoned the de&s;ign he had formed of coming to an anchor, when we were through the narrows, and afterwards of mak|ing an excur&s;ion to &s;ee the funeral. He rather cho&s;e to be ab&s;ent from that ceremony, than to leave the &s;hips in &s;o dangerous a &s;ituation. We plied to windward, between the two tides, till it was near high water, without either gaining or lo&s;ing an inch, when we &s;uddenly got into the in|fluence of the ea&s;tern tide, where we expected the ebb to run &s;trong to the ea&s;tward in our favour. It proved, however, very incon&s;iderable. Con|vinced that we could not get to &s;ea before it was dark, we anchored under the &s;hore of Tongataboo, in forty-five fathoms water. The Di&s;covery drop|ped anchor under our &s;tern; but drove off the bank before the anchor took hold, and did not recover it till about midnight.</P>
<P>After remaining in this &s;tation till eleven o'clock the next day, we weighed, and plied to the ea&s;t|ward. At ten o'clock at night we weathered the ea&s;t end of the i&s;land, and &s;tretched away, for Mid|dleburg, or Eooa (as the inhabitants call it) where we anchored,, about eight the next morning, in forty fathoms water; being nearly the &s;ame place
<PB N="259" REF="030274_0318_0FE56D842A6610A0">
where the Captain took his &s;tation in 1773, when he named it <HI>Engli&s;h Road.</HI></P>
<P>As &s;oon as we had anchored, Taoofa the chief, and &s;everal of the natives vi&s;ited us on board, and &s;eemed rejoiced at our arrival. This Taoofa had been Captain Cook's <HI>Tayo</HI> when he was here in 1773, and therefore they were not &s;trangers to each other. The Captain accompanied him on &s;hore in &s;earch of fre&s;h water, the procuring of which was the chief object that brought him to Eooa. He had heard at Tongataboo of a &s;tream here, which ran from the hills into the &s;ea; but this was not the ca&s;e at pre&s;ent. He was con|ducted to a bracki&s;h &s;pring, among rocks, be|tween low and high water mark. When they perceived that we did not approve of this we were &s;hewn a little way into the i&s;land; where, in a deep cha&s;m, we found &s;ome excellent water; which, though attended with &s;ome trouble, might be conveyed to the &s;hore, by means of &s;pouts or troughs, that might be provided for that purpo&s;e: but rather than undertake that tedious ta&s;k, the Captain contented him&s;elf with the &s;upply the &s;hips had received at Tongataboo.</P>
<P>Before he returned on board, he began a traffic for hogs and yams. Of the former we could not procure many; but of the latter, plenty. At this i&s;land we landed the ram and two ewes, of the Cape of Good Hope breed, and committed them to the care of Taoofa, who &s;eemed delighted
<PB N="260" REF="030274_0319_0FE56D8601189038">
with his charge. It was, perhaps, a fortunate circum&s;tance that Mareewagee, to whom they had been given, as before related, &s;lighted the pre|&s;ent: as Eooa had no dogs upon it at pre&s;ent, it &s;eemed to be a fitter place for the rearing of &s;heep than Tongataboo.</P>
<P>While we were lying at anchor, this i&s;land had a very different a&s;pect from any that we had lately &s;een, and formed a mo&s;t plea&s;ing land&s;cape. It is the highe&s;t of any we had &s;een &s;ince we had left New-Zealand, and from its top, which ap|pears to be almo&s;t flat, declines gradually towards the &s;ea. The other i&s;les, which form this clu&s;ter, being level, the eye cannot di&s;cover any thing except the trees that cover them, but here the land, ri&s;ing gently upwards, pre&s;ents an exten&s;ive pro&s;pect, where groves of trees in beautiful di&s;|order, are inter&s;per&s;ed at irregular di&s;tances. Near the &s;hore, it is quite &s;haded with a variety of trees, among which are erected the habitations of the natives; and to the right of where we were &s;tationed, was one of the mo&s;t exten&s;ive groves of cocoa-palms that we had ever &s;een.</P>
<P>In the afternoon of the 13th, a party of us a&s;|cended the highe&s;t part of the i&s;land, a little to the right of our &s;hips, to have a perfect view of the country. Having advanced about half way up, we cro&s;&s;ed a deep valley, the bottom and &s;ides of which were clothed with t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ees. We found plenty of coral till we approached the &s;ummits of
<PB N="261" REF="030274_0320_0FE56D8B59277BD0">
the highe&s;t hills; the &s;oil near the top is, in ge|neral, a reddi&s;h clay; which in many places, is very deep. On the mo&s;t elevated part of the i&s;land we &s;aw a round platform, &s;upported by a wall of coral &s;tones. Our conductors informed us that this mount had been rai&s;ed by the direction of their chief; and that they met there, occa&s;i|onally, to drink <HI>kava.</HI> They called it <HI>Etchee;</HI> by which name an erection was di&s;tingui&s;hed which we had &s;een at Tongataboo. At a &s;mall di&s;tance from it was a &s;pring of mo&s;t excellent water; and, about a mile lower down, a &s;tream, which, we were told, ran into the &s;ea when the rains were copious. We al&s;o di&s;covered water in &s;everal &s;mall holes; and &s;uppo&s;ed that plenty might be found by digging.</P>
<P>From this elevation we had a complete view of the whole i&s;land, except a &s;mall part to the &s;outh. The &s;outh-ea&s;t &s;ide, from which the hills we were now upon are not far di&s;tant, ri&s;es with great in|equalities, immediately from the &s;ea; &s;o that the plains and meadows lie all on the north-we&s;t &s;ide; which being adorned with tufts of trees, inter|mixed with plantations, form a mo&s;t delightful land&s;cape in every point of view. While Captain Cook was &s;urveying this enchanting pro&s;pect, he enjoyed the plea&s;ing idea, that &s;ome future navi|gators might, from the &s;ame eminence, behold the&s;e meadows &s;tocked with cattle, brought by the &s;hips of England; and that the completion of this
<PB N="262" REF="030274_0321_0FE56DA1AE17B2A8">
&s;ingle benevolent purpo&s;e, exclu&s;ive of all other con&s;iderations, would &s;ufficiently prove that our voyages had not been u&s;ele&s;s. We found, on this height, be&s;ides the plants common on the neigh|bouring i&s;les, a &s;pecies of <HI>acro&s;ticum, mela&s;toma,</HI> and fern-tree.</P>
<P>All, or mo&s;t of the land on this i&s;land, we were told, belonged to the chiefs of Tongataboo; the inhabitants being only tenants, or va&s;&s;als, to them. This &s;eemed, indeed, to be the ca&s;e at all the neighbouring i&s;les, except Annamooka, where &s;ome of the chiefs &s;eemed to act with &s;ome kind of independence. Omai, who was much e&s;teemed by Feenou, and many others, was tempt|ed with the offer of being appointed a chief of this i&s;land, if he would continue among them; and he &s;eemed inclinable to have accepted the offer, had he not been advi&s;ed to the contrary by Cap|tain Cook, though not becau&s;e he thought he would do better for him&s;elf in his native i&s;le.</P>
<P>Returning from our country excur&s;ion, we heard that a party of the natives, in the quarter where our people traded, had &s;truck one of their own people with a club, which fractured his &s;kull, and afterwards broke his thigh with the &s;ame in&s;tru|ment. No &s;igns of life were remaining, when he was carried to a neighbouring hou&s;e, but, in a &s;hort time, he recovered a little. On our de|&s;iring to know the rea&s;on of &s;uch &s;everity we were informed, that he had been di&s;covered in an
<PB N="263" REF="030274_0322_0FE56DA334B73570">
indelicate &s;ituation with a woman who was <HI>taboo'd,</HI> we &s;oon under&s;tood, however, that &s;he was no otherwi&s;e <HI>taboo'd</HI> than by belonging to another per&s;on, who was &s;uperior in rank to her gallant. We di&s;covered from this circum&s;tance, how the&s;e people puni&s;h &s;uch infidelities. But the female &s;inner, as we were informed, has a much milder puni&s;hment for her mi&s;demeanour, and only re|ceives a remon&s;trance and a very &s;light beating.</P>
<P>Captain Cook, the next morning, planted a pine-apple, and &s;owed the &s;eeds of melons and other articles, in the chief's plantation. He had rea&s;on, indeed to &s;uppo&s;e, that his endeavours of this kind would not be fruitle&s;s; for a di&s;h o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> turnips was, this day, &s;erved up at his dinner, which was the produce of the &s;eeds he had left here in 1773.</P>
<P>The Captain having fixed upon the 15th for &s;ailing, Taoofa pre&s;&s;ed him to &s;tay a little longer, in order to receive a pre&s;ent which he had pre|pared for him. His entreaties, together with the daily expectation of receiving a vi&s;it from &s;ome of his friends at Tongataboo, induced him to defer his departure. The next day he received from the chief the pre&s;ent; con&s;i&s;ting of two little heaps of yams, and a quantity of fruit, which &s;eemed to be collected as at the other i&s;les. On this occa&s;ion the greate&s;t part of the inhabitants of the i&s;land had a&s;&s;embled; and, as we had many times experienced on &s;uch numerous meetings
<PB N="264" REF="030274_0323_0FE56DA4C4A846A8">
among their neighbouring i&s;landers, gave us no &s;mall trouble to prevent their pilfering. Cud|gelling, wre&s;tling and boxing, were exhibited for our entertainment; and in the latter, comba|tants, of both &s;exes engaged. The diver&s;ions were intended to have been fini&s;hed with the <HI>bomai</HI> or night-dance; but an accident happened that either put a total &s;top to it, or, at lea&s;t, pre|vented our &s;taying on &s;hore to &s;ee it. One of our people was &s;urrounded by twenty or thirty of the natives, &s;ome of whom knocked him down, &s;trip|ped him, and carried off all his clothes. Hearing of this, the Commodore &s;eized two canoes, and a large hog; and in&s;i&s;ted on the chief's not only cau&s;ing the apparel to be re&s;tored, but al&s;o on the offenders being delivered up to him. Taoofa &s;eemed greatly concerned at what had happened, and took the nece&s;&s;ary &s;teps to &s;atisfy him. The people who were a&s;&s;embled were &s;o alarmed at this affair, that mo&s;t of them immediately fled. How|ever, when they were informed that the Captain meant to take no other mea&s;ures to revenge the in&s;ult, they returned. One of the delinquents was &s;oon delivered up to him, and a &s;hirt and at pair of trow&s;ers re&s;tored. The remainder of the &s;tolen goods not coming in before the evening, the Commodore was obliged to leave them, in order to go aboard; the &s;ea running &s;o high, that it was extremely difficult for the boats to get out of the creek even with day-light, and would be
<PB N="265" REF="030274_0324_0FE56DA69B676950">
attended with much more danger in the dark. He came a&s;hore again the next morning, bringing with him a pre&s;ent for Taoofa, in return for what he had received from him. Being early, there were but few people at the landing-place, and even tho&s;e few not without their fears and appre|hen&s;ions; but on the Captain's de&s;iring Omai to a&s;&s;ure them, that we did not mean to injure them; and having re&s;tored the canoes, and re|lea&s;ed the offender, who had been delivered up to him, they re&s;umed their u&s;ual chearfulne&s;s, and a large circle was pre&s;ently formed, in which the chief and the principal men of the i&s;land took their re&s;pective places.</P>
<P>The remainder of the cloths were at length brought in, but, having been torn off the man's back by pieces, they were not thought worth carrying on board. Taoofa &s;hared the pre&s;ent he had received, with three or four other chiefs, re&s;erving a &s;mall part only for him&s;elf. This donation &s;o far exceeded their expectation, that a venerable old chief told the Captain, they were not de&s;erving of it, con&s;idering how little he had received from them, and the ill treatment one of his people had met with. Captain Cook con|tinued with them, till they had emptied their bowl of <HI>kava;</HI> and then, after paying for the hog, which he had taken the day before, returned on board, in company with Taoofa, and one of Pou|laho's &s;ervants, by whom he &s;ent a piece of bar
<PB N="266" REF="030274_0325_0FE56DAC67B920E0">
iron, as a parting mark of his e&s;teem for that chief, that being as valuable a pre&s;ent a any he could po&s;&s;ibly make.</P>
<P>We weighed &s;oon after and with a light breeze at &s;outh-ea&s;t, &s;tood out to &s;ea, when Taoofa, and &s;ome other natives, left us. We found, on heaving up the anchor, that the cable had been much injured by the rocks. Be&s;ides this, we ex|perienced, that a mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hing &s;well rolls in there from the &s;outh-we&s;t. Pre&s;ently we ob&s;erved a &s;ailing canoe entering the creek before which we had anchored our &s;hips. A few hours after, a &s;mall canoe, conducted by four men, came off to us: for, having but very little wind, we were &s;till at no con&s;iderable di&s;tance from the land. We were informed, by the&s;e men, that the &s;ailing canoe, which we had &s;een arrive, had brought di|rections to the people of Eooa, to furni&s;h us with hogs; and that the king, and other chiefs, would be with us in the &s;pace of two or three days. They reque&s;ted, therefore, that we would re|turn to our former &s;tation. There was no rea|&s;on to doubt the truth of this information; but being now clear of the land, it was not a &s;uffi|cient inducement to bring us back: e&s;pecially, as we had, already, a &s;ufficient &s;tock of fre&s;h pro|vi&s;ions to la&s;t us in our pa&s;&s;age to Otaheite. Be|&s;ides Taoofa's pre&s;ent, we received a large quan|tity of yams at Eooa, in exchange for nails, &amp;c. and added con&s;iderably to our &s;upply of hogs.
<PB N="267" REF="030274_0326_0FE56DAE76349640">
Finding that we would not return, the&s;e people left us in the evening, as did &s;ome others who had come off in two canoes, with cocoa-nuts and &s;haddocks, to barter for what they could get; their eagerne&s;s to po&s;&s;e&s;s more of our com|modities, inducing them to follow us out to &s;ea, and to continue their intercou&s;e with us even to the la&s;t moment.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>WE have now taken leave of the Friendly I&s;lands, and their inhabitants, after a cor|dial intercour&s;e with the latter for between two and three months. Some differences, indeed,
<PB N="268" REF="030274_0327_0FE56DB05413F808">
occa&s;ionally happened on account of their natural propen&s;ity to thieving, though too frequently encouraged by the negligence and inattention of our people. The&s;e differences, however, were never attended with any fatal con&s;equences; and few, belonging to our &s;hips, parted from their friends without &s;ome regret. The time we con|tinued here was not thrown away; and as we, in a great mea&s;ure, &s;ub&s;i&s;ted upon the produce of the i&s;lands, we expended very little of our &s;ea provi&s;ions. We carried with us a &s;ufficient quan|tity of refre&s;hments, to &s;upply us till our arrival at another &s;tation, where we could again recruit. The Commodore rejoiced at having <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">d an op|portunity of &s;erving the&s;e poor people by leav|ing &s;ome u&s;eful animals among them; and that tho&s;e intended for Otaheite, had acquired fre&s;h &s;trength in the pa&s;tures of Tongataboo. The advantages we received by touching here, were great, and they were received without retarding the pro&s;ecution of our great object; the &s;ea&s;on for proceeding to the north being lo&s;t, before we formed the re&s;olution of vi&s;iting the&s;e i&s;lands.</P>
<P>Iron tools are the be&s;t articles for traffic here. Axes, hatchets, nails of all &s;izes, knives, ra&s;ps, and files, are much demanded. Red cloth, white and coloured linen; looking-gla&s;&s;es and beads, are al&s;o in great e&s;timation; but, of the latter, tho&s;e which are blue are preferred to all others e&s;pecially the white ones. A hog might, at any
<PB N="269" REF="030274_0328_0FE56DB1DB875530">
time, be purcha&s;ed, by a &s;tring of large blue beads; it &s;hould, neverthele&s;s, be ob&s;erved, that articles, merely ornamental, may be highly e&s;|teemed at one time, and di&s;regarded at another. On our fir&s;t arrival at Annamooka, the people were unwilling to take them in exchange for fruit; but when Feenou arrived, his approbation of them brought them into vogue, and &s;tamped them with the value above-mentioned.</P>
<P>In return for the commodities ju&s;t enumerated, all the refre&s;hments that the i&s;lands produce may be procured. The yams, produced by the Friendly I&s;lands, are excellent, and, when grown to per|fection, pre&s;erve well at &s;ea: but their pork, plantains, and bread-fruit, are inferior in quality to the &s;ame articles at Otaheite.</P>
<P>Good water is &s;carce in the&s;e i&s;lands. It may be found, indeed, in all of them, but not to &s;erve the purpo&s;es of navigators; for either the &s;ituations are too inconvenient, or the quantities too incon&s;iderable. Whil&s;t we lay at anchor under Kotoo, we were informed, that there was a &s;tream of water at Kao, which ran from the mountains into the &s;ea, on the &s;outh-we&s;t &s;ide of the i&s;land. This intelligence may probably de|&s;erve the attention of future navigators.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t include, under the denomination of Friendly I&s;lands, not only the group at Hapaee, but al&s;o tho&s;e which have been di&s;covered to the north, nearly under the &s;ame meridian, as well as
<PB N="270" REF="030274_0329_0FE56DB622611620">
&s;ome others under the dominion of Tongataboo which is the capital, and &s;eat of government.</P>
<P>From the be&s;t information we could receive, this archipelago is very exten&s;ive. One of the natives enumerated one hundred and fifty i&s;lands: and Mr. Ander&s;on procured all their names. Sixty-one of them are marked upon our chart of the Friendly I&s;lands, and upon the &s;ketch of the harbour of Tongataboo. Keppel's and Bo&s;ca|wen's I&s;lands, two of Captain Wallis's di&s;coveries in 1765, are doubtle&s;s comprehended in Mr. Ander&s;on's li&s;t.</P>
<P>But the mo&s;t con&s;iderable i&s;lands that we heard of in this neighbourhood, are Hamoa, Vavaoo, and Feejee; each of which is larger than Ton|gataboo; but it does not appear that any Euro|pean has ever yet &s;een any one of them.</P>
<P>Hamoa lies two days &s;ail north-we&s;t from Va|vaoo. It is &s;aid to be the large&s;t of all their i&s;lands; affords harbours and good water, and produces, in abundance, all the articles of re|fre&s;hment that are found at the places we vi&s;ited. Poulaho frequently re&s;ides upon this i&s;land; and the people here are in high e&s;timation at Ton|gataboo.</P>
<P>Feejee lies in the direction of north-we&s;t by we&s;t, about three days &s;ail from Tongataboo. It abounds with hogs; dogs, fowls, and &s;uch fruits and roots as are to be found in any of the others and is much larger that Tongataboo; but not
<PB N="271" REF="030274_0330_0FE56DB8875B9350">
&s;ubjec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> its dominion, as the other i&s;lands of this archipelago are. Feejee and Tongataboo often engage in war again&s;t each other; and the inhabitants of the latter are often &s;o much afraid of this enemy, that they bend the body forward, and cover the face with their hands, to expre&s;s the &s;en&s;e of their own inferiority to the Feejee men. This is, indeed, no matter of &s;urpri&s;e, for tho&s;e of Feejee have rendered them&s;elves formid|able, by their dexterity in the u&s;e of bows and &s;lings; but more &s;o, by their &s;avage practice of eating &s;uch of their enemies as they kill in battle.</P>
<P>It has been in&s;i&s;ted on, that extreme hunger fir&s;t occa&s;ioned men to feed on human fle&s;h; but where could be the inducement for the Feejee people to continue the practice in the mid&s;t of plenty? It is held in dete&s;tation by the inhabi|tants of Tongataboo, who &s;eem to cultivate the friend&s;hip of their &s;avage neighbours of Feejee through fear; though they, occa&s;ionally, venture to &s;kirmi&s;h with them on their own territory, and carry off large quantities of red feathers as tro|phies. When a profound peace reigns between the two i&s;lands, they have frequent intercour&s;e together; though, it is probable they have not long been known to each other; or, it might be &s;uppo&s;ed that Tongataboo, and its neighbouring i&s;lands, would, before this time, have been &s;up|plied with a breed of dogs, which are numerous
<PB N="272" REF="030274_0331_0FE56DBA0D8D44D0">
at Feejee, and were not introduced at Tongata|boo, when Captain Cook fir&s;t vi&s;ited it, in 1773.</P>
<P>The colour of the natives of Feejee was, at lea&s;t, a &s;hade darker than that of the inhabitants of the other Friendly I&s;lands. We &s;aw one of the natives of Feejee, who had his left ear &s;lit, and the lobe &s;o &s;tretched, that it almo&s;t extended to his &s;houlder; which &s;ingularity had been ob|&s;erved by Captain Cook at other i&s;lands of the South Sea, during his &s;econd voyage. The Fee|jee men were much reverenced here; not only on account of their power and cruelty in war, but al&s;o for their ingenuity; for they greatly ex|cel the inhabitants of Tongataboo in workman|&s;hip. Specimens were &s;hewn us of their clubs and &s;pears, which were ingeniou&s;ly carved. We were al&s;o &s;hewn &s;ome of their beautifully che|quered cloth, variegated mats, earthen pots, and other articles, all of which di&s;played &s;uperiority in the execution.</P>
<P>Feejee, as has been already mentioned, is three days &s;ail from Tongataboo; the&s;e people having no other method of di&s;covering the di&s;tance from i&s;land to i&s;land, but by mentioning the time re|quired for the voyage in one of their canoes. That this might be a&s;certained with &s;ome preci|&s;ion, Captain Cook &s;ailed in one of their canoes, and by repeated trials with the log, found that &s;he went clo&s;e hauled in a gentle gale, &s;even miles in an hour. He &s;uppo&s;ed from this that
<PB N="273" REF="030274_0332_0FE56DBC0405B960">
they will &s;ail, with &s;uch breezes as in general blow in their &s;eas &s;even or eight miles an hour on an average. Each day, however, is not to be reckoned at twenty-four hours; for when they talk of one days &s;ail, they mean no more than from the morning to the evening, or ten or twelve hours at the mo&s;t. From the morning of the fir&s;t day till the evening of the &s;econd, is, with them, two days &s;ail. In the day, they are guided by the &s;un; and, in the night, by &s;tars. When the&s;e are ob&s;cured, they can only have recour&s;e to the points from whence the winds and waves come upon the ve&s;&s;el. If, at that time the winds and the waves &s;hould &s;hift they are quit bewildered, often mi&s;&s;ing their intended port, and being never heard of more. The &s;tory of Omai's countrymen, who where driven to Wa|teeoo, convinces us however, that tho&s;e who are not heard of, are not always lo&s;t.</P>
<P>The harbour and anchoring-place of Tonga|taboo, is &s;uperior to any we have met with among the&s;e i&s;lands, as well from its great &s;ecurity, as its capacity, and goodne&s;s of bottom. The ri&s;k we ran in entering it from the north, &s;hould cau|tion every future commander from attempting that pa&s;&s;age again, e&s;pecially with a &s;hip of bur|den, &s;ince that, by which we left it, may be pur|&s;ued with greater ea&s;e and &s;afety.</P>
<P>Though the harbour of Tongataboo has the preference, its water is exceeded in goodne&s;s, by
<PB N="274" REF="030274_0333_0FE56DC3915B15B0">
that at Annamocka, and yet this cannot be rec|koned good. Tolerable water may neverthele&s;s, be procured, by digging holes near the &s;ide of the pond. Be&s;ides, Annamooka being nearly in the centre of the group, is the be&s;t &s;ituated for procuring refre&s;hments from the others. There is a creek in the reef on the north &s;ide of the i&s;lands, wherein two or three &s;hips may lie &s;e|curely.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who are de&s;irous of having a more par|ticular de&s;cription of the Friendly I&s;lands, mu&s;t have recour&s;e to the chart, where every thing is delineated as accurately as circum&s;tances would permit. To the &s;ame chart, recour&s;e may al&s;o be had for tracing the &s;everal &s;tations of the &s;hips, and their route.</P>
<P>What may have been here omitted; concerning the geography of the&s;e i&s;lands, will be found in the hi&s;tory of Captain Cook's la&s;t voyage <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cook's Voyage, Vol. I p. 211.213.</NOTE>; to which narrative the reader is referred <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 213.225.</NOTE>, for &s;uch particulars as he had then ob&s;erved. At pre&s;ent, we &s;hall only relate &s;uch intere&s;ting circum&s;tances, as either were omitted in that account, or were imperfectly and incorrectly repre&s;ented.</P>
<P>After living among them between two and three months, it is rea&s;onable to expect, that we &s;hould be able to clear up every difficulty, and to give a tolerably good account of their manners, cu&s;|toms,
<PB N="275" REF="030274_0334_0FE56DC56FC25568">
and in&s;titutions, civil as well as religious; particularly as we had a per&s;on with us, who, by under&s;tanding their language as well as ours, might be enabled to act as an interpreter. But Omai was not qualified for that ta&s;k. Unle&s;s we had before us the object or thing, concerning which we wanted information, we found it diffi|cult to obtain a competent knowledge from his explanations. Omai was certainly more liable to make mi&s;takes than we were: for having no curio&s;ity, he never troubled him&s;elf with mak|ing remarks; and when he attempted to explain matters to us, his ideas were apparently &s;o limit|ed, and, probably, differed &s;o much from ours, that his confu&s;ed accounts, in&s;tead of in&s;tructing, often only perplexed us. Be&s;ides, we could &s;el|dom find a per&s;on, among the natives, who had both the ability and inclination to give us the in|formation we required. And many of them, we ob&s;erved, appeared offended at being a&s;ked, what they, perhaps, deemed frivolous que&s;tions. At Tongataboo, where we continued the longe&s;t, our &s;ituation was likewi&s;e unfavourable; being in a part of the country, where, except fi&s;hers, there were but few inhabitants. With our vi&s;itors, as well as tho&s;e we vi&s;ited, it was always holi|day; &s;o that we could not ob&s;erve, what was really the dome&s;tic way of living among the na|tives. That we could not, therefore, in this &s;itu|ation, bring away &s;atisfactory accounts of many
<PB N="276" REF="030274_0335_0FE56DC6F6AD7B78">
things, is not the lea&s;t &s;urpri&s;ing. Some of us, indeed, endeavoured by diligent ob&s;ervation, to remedy tho&s;e di&s;advantages; and we are indebted to Mr. Ander&s;on, for a con&s;iderable &s;hare of what is related in this and the following chapter.</P>
<P>The friendly i&s;landers &s;eldom exceed the com|mon &s;tature, (though &s;ome here were above &s;ix feet in height) and are &s;trong and well proporti|oned. Their &s;houlders are, in general, broad; and we &s;aw &s;everal who were really hand&s;ome, though their mu&s;cular di&s;po&s;ition rather conveyed the idea of &s;trength than of beauty. Their fea|tures are &s;o various, that, unle&s;s it be a ful|ne&s;s at the point of the no&s;e, which is common it is impo&s;&s;ible to fix any general likene&s;s by which to characterize them. On the other hand many genuine Roman no&s;es, and hundreds of Eu|ropean faces, were &s;een among&s;t them. They have good eyes and teeth; but the latter are nei|ther &s;o well &s;et, nor &s;o remarkably white, as among the Indian nations. Few of them, however have that uncommon thickne&s;s about the lips, &s;o fre|quent in other i&s;lands.</P>
<P>The women are le&s;s di&s;tingui&s;hed from the men by their features, than by their general form, which &s;eems de&s;titute of that &s;trong fle&s;hly firm|ne&s;s that appears in the latter. Though the fea|tures of &s;ome are very delicate, and a true index of their &s;ex, laying claim to a con&s;iderable &s;hare of beauty and expre&s;&s;ion, yet the rule is not, by
<PB N="277" REF="030274_0336_0FE56DC8828700D0">
any means, &s;o general, as in many other coun|tries. This is generally, however, the mo&s;t ex|ceptionable part; for the bodies of mo&s;t of the fe|males are u&s;ually well proportioned; and &s;ome are ab&s;olutely perfect models, of a beautiful figure. But the extraordinary &s;mallne&s;s and delicacy of their fingers, which may be put into competition with any in Europe, &s;eems to be the mo&s;t remark|able di&s;tinction in the women.</P>
<P>The general colour among the natives is a ca&s;t deeper than the copper brown; but &s;everal of both &s;exes, have a true olive complexion. Some of the women are even much fairer; owing, per|haps, to their being le&s;s expo&s;ed to the &s;un; as a tendency to corpulence, in &s;ome of the prin|cipal people, &s;eems to be the natural con&s;equence of a more indolent life: a &s;ofter and clearer &s;kin is almo&s;t frequently ob&s;erved among the latter. Among the major part of the people, the &s;kin is generally of a dull hue, with &s;ome degree of roughne&s;s, particularly the parts that are unco|vered, occa&s;ioned, perhaps, by &s;ome cutaneous di&s;ea&s;e. We &s;aw a man at Hapaee, perfectly white, and a child equally &s;o at Annamooka. In all black nations, &s;uch phenomena are found, but their colour, it is imagined, proceeds from a di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, however, few natural defects or deformities are to be &s;een among them; though we ob&s;erved two or three with their feet bent in|wards.
<PB N="278" REF="030274_0337_0FE56DCD76911DC0">
Neither are they exempt from &s;ome di&s;|ea&s;es. Va&s;t numbers of them are effected with the tetter or ringworm, which leaves whiti&s;h &s;er|pentine marks behind it. But they have another di&s;ea&s;e of a more mi&s;chievous con&s;equence, which is al&s;o very frequent, and appears on every part of the body, in large broad ulcers, di&s;charging a thin, clear pus, &s;ome of which had a very viru|lent appearance, particularly on the face. Some, however, appeared to be cured of it, and others mending; but it was generally attended with the lo&s;s of the no&s;e, or a con&s;iderable part of it. It being certainly known, and even acknowledged by them&s;elves, that the natives were &s;ubject to this di&s;ea&s;e before they were vi&s;ited by the Eng|li&s;h, it cannot be the effect of venereal contagion, notwith&s;tanding the &s;imilarity of the &s;ymptoms; unle&s;s we adopt the &s;uppo&s;ition, that the venereal di&s;order was not introduced here by our people, in 1773. It certainly was among&s;t them at this time; for, &s;oon after we arrived there, &s;ome of our people received the infection; and Captain Cook had the mortification to learn from hence, that all the care he took in 1773, to prevent the communication of this dreadful di&s;ea&s;e, had prov|ed ineffectual. They do not &s;eem, however, to regard it much; and, as we did not &s;ee many in&s;tances of its de&s;troying effects, perhaps the climate, and the way of living of the&s;e people, may abate its virulence. Two other di&s;ea&s;es are
<PB N="279" REF="030274_0338_0FE56DD09E8ACD48">
common among&s;t them; one of which is a firm &s;welling, which effects the legs and arms, the other is a tumour in the te&s;tacles, which &s;ome|times exceed the &s;ize of the two fi&s;ts. In other re&s;pects, they are remarkably healthy, not a &s;ingle per&s;on having, during our &s;tay, being confined to the hou&s;e by any kind of &s;ickne&s;s. Their &s;trength and activity are, in every re&s;pect, an&s;werable to their mu&s;cular appearance; and they exert both, in &s;uch a manner, as to prove, that they are, as yet, little debilitated by the numerous di&s;ea&s;es that are the natural con&s;equences of indolence.</P>
<P>The graceful mien and firmne&s;s of &s;tep with which they walk, are obvious proofs of their per|&s;onal accompli&s;hments. They con&s;ider this as a thing &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to be acquired, that their laugh|ter was excited when they &s;aw us frequently &s;tum|bling upon the roots of trees, or other inequali|ties, in walking.</P>
<P>The mildne&s;s or good-nature which they abun|dantly po&s;&s;e&s;s, is depicted on their countenance, which are totally free from that &s;avage keenne&s;s, which always marks the nations that are in a bar|barous &s;tate. We might almo&s;t be induced to &s;uppo&s;e, that they had been reared under the &s;e|vere&s;t re&s;trictions, to acquire &s;o &s;ettled an a&s;pect, &s;uch a command of their pa&s;&s;ions, and &s;uch a &s;teadine&s;s of conduct. At the &s;ame time, they are open, chearful, and good-humoured; though, in the pre&s;ence of their chiefs, they &s;ometimes
<PB N="280" REF="030274_0339_0FE56DD226625EC8">
a&s;&s;ume a degree of gravity, which has the ap|pearance of re&s;erve.</P>
<P>Their pacific di&s;po&s;ition is thoroughly evinced, from their friendly reception of all &s;trangers. In|&s;tead of attacking them openly,, or clande&s;tinely, they have never appeared, in the &s;malle&s;t degree, ho&s;tile; but, like the mo&s;t civilized nations, have even courted an intercour&s;e with their vi&s;itors, by bartering; a medium which unites all nations in a degree of friend&s;hip. So perfectly do they under&s;tand barter, that, at fir&s;t we &s;uppo&s;ed they had acquired the knowledge of it by trading with the neighbouring i&s;lands; but it afterwards appeared, that they had hardly any traffic, except with Feejee. No nation, perhaps, in the world, di&s;played, in their traffic, more hone&s;ty and le&s;s di&s;tru&s;t. We &s;afely permitted them to examine our goods, and they had the &s;ame implicit confi|dence in us. If either party became di&s;&s;atisfied with his bargain, a re-exchange was made with mutual con&s;ent and &s;atisfaction. They &s;eem, upon the whole, to po&s;&s;e&s;s many of the mo&s;t ex|cellent qualities that adorn the human mind.</P>
<P>A propen&s;ity to thieving, &s;eems to be the only defect to &s;ully their fair character. Tho&s;e of all ages, and both &s;exes, were addicted to it in an uncommon degree. It &s;hould be con&s;idered, how|ever, that this exceptionable part of their conduct exi&s;ted merely with re&s;pect to us; for, in their general intercour&s;e with each other, thefts are
<PB N="281" REF="030274_0340_0FE56DD41267BF08">
not, perhaps, more frequent than in other coun|tries, where the di&s;hone&s;t practices of individuals &s;hould not authorize any indi&s;criminate cen&s;ure on the people at large. Allowances &s;hould be made for the foibles of the&s;e poor i&s;landers, who&s;e minds we overpowered with the glare of new and captivating objects. Stealing, among civilized nations, denotes a character deeply &s;tained with moral turpitude. But at the Friendly I&s;lands, and others which we vi&s;ited, the thefts committed by the natives, may have been occa&s;ioned by le&s;s culpable motives. They were &s;timulated &s;olely by curio&s;ity and de&s;ire to po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;omething new, and the property of a &s;ort of people &s;o different from them&s;elves. And, perhaps, if a &s;et of be|ings, &s;eemingly as &s;uperior to us, as we appear to be to them, &s;hould make their appearance among us, it might be po&s;&s;ible that our natural regard to ju&s;tice would not be able to re&s;train many from being guilty of the &s;ame error. That this is the true motive for their propen&s;ity to this practice, is evident from their &s;tealing every thing indi&s;criminately. The thieving di&s;po&s;ition of the&s;e i&s;landers, was the means, however, of affording us &s;ome information as to their inge|nuity and their quickne&s;s of intellects. For their petty thefts were managed with much dexterity; and tho&s;e of greater con&s;equence, with a &s;ettled plan or &s;cheme, adapted to the importance of the objects.</P>
<P><PB N="282" REF="030274_0341_0FE56DD9A3F60248">The hair of the&s;e i&s;landers is in general, thick, &s;traight, and &s;trong; though &s;ome have it bu&s;hy or frizzled. The natural colour appears to be black, but many of the men, and &s;ome of the women, &s;tain it of a brown, or purple colour; and a few give it an orange ca&s;t. The fir&s;t of the&s;e colours is produced by applying a &s;ort of plai&s;ter of burnt coral mixed with water; the &s;e|cond, by the ra&s;pings of a reddi&s;h wood, mixed into a poultice, and laid over the hair; and the third is &s;aid to be the effect of <HI>turmeric root.</HI></P>
<P>They are &s;o whim&s;ical in their fa&s;hions of wear|ing their hair, that it is difficult to &s;ay which is mo&s;t in vogue. Some have none on one &s;ide of the head, while it remains long on the other &s;ide; &s;ome have only a part cut &s;hort, others have parted with the whole, except a &s;ingle lock on one &s;ide. Some permit it to grown to its full length, without any of the&s;e mutilations. The women u&s;ually wear it &s;hort. The beards too are cut &s;hort, and both &s;exes &s;trip the hair from their arm-pits. The men are &s;tained with a deep blue colour from the middle of the belly, to half way down the thighs. This is effected with a flat bone in&s;trument, full of fine teeth, which by a &s;troke of a bit of &s;tick introduce<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the juice of <HI>dooe dooe</HI> into the &s;kin, by whi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> means indeliable marks are made.

in the in&s;ide of their hands. As a mark of di&s;tinction, their kings are excepted from this cu&s;tom. The men are not circumci&s;ed, but ra|ther &s;uperci&s;ed; the operation con&s;i&s;ts in cutting off only a piece of the fore&s;kin in the upper part, which is thus rendered incapable of ever cover|ing the <HI>glans.</HI> They have no other aim in this operation, and only practi&s;e it from a notion of cleanline&s;s.</P>
<P>The dre&s;s of both &s;exes is the &s;ame; con&s;i&s;ting of a piece of cloth or matting, about two yards in breadth, and two yards and a half in length. It is double before, and, like a petticoat, hangs down to the middle of the leg. That part of the garment which is above the girdle, is plaited into &s;everal folds, which extended is &s;ufficient to draw up and wrap round the &s;houl|ders. This as to form, is the general dre&s;s: but the fine matting, and long pieces of cloth, are worn only by the &s;uperior cla&s;s of people. The inferior &s;ort are contented with &s;mall pieces and very often, have only a covering made of leaves of plants, or the <HI>maro,</HI> a narrow piece of cloth, or matting, like a &s;a&s;h. They pa&s;s this between the thighs and round the wai&s;t. It is &s;eldom u&s;ed but by the men. In their <HI>haivas,</HI> or grand entertainments, they have various dre&s;&s;es, which, though the &s;ame in form, are embelli&s;hed, more or le&s;s, with red feathers.</P>

<P>Two holes are perforated in the lobes of the ears, in which they wear cylindrical bits of ivory. of the length of three inches, introduced at one hole, and drawn out of the other; or bits of reeds, filled with a yellow pigment.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE dome&s;tic life of the&s;e people is neither &s;o laborious as to be di&s;agreeable, nor &s;o free from employment as to &s;uffer them to dege|nerate
<PB N="286" REF="030274_0345_0FE56DE3E1F183A0">
into indolence. Their country has been &s;o favoured by nature, that the fir&s;t can &s;carcely occur; and their di&s;po&s;ition appears to be a &s;uf|ficient bar to the la&s;t. By this fortunate con|currence of circum&s;tances, their nece&s;&s;ary labour &s;eems to yield, in its turn, to their amu&s;ements and recreations, which are never interrupted by the thoughts of being obliged to recur to bu&s;i|ne&s;s, till they are induced by &s;atiety to wi&s;h for that tran&s;ition. The employments of the women is not difficult: and is generally &s;uch as they can execute in the hou&s;e. The making of cloth is entirely entru&s;ted to their care; the proce&s;s of which manufacture has been already de&s;cribed. Their cloth is of different degrees of finene&s;s: the coar&s;er kind does not receive the impre&s;&s;ion of any pattern: but, of the finer &s;ort, they have various patterns, differently coloured. The cloth, in general, is able to re&s;i&s;t water for &s;ome time; but that which has the &s;tronge&s;t glaze, is the lea&s;t liable to be penetrated by that fluid.</P>
<P>Another manufacture which is al&s;o con&s;igned to the women, is that of their mats, which excel tho&s;e of mo&s;t other countries, both with re&s;pect to their texture and their beauty. Of the&s;e mats there are &s;even or eight different &s;orts, which they either wear or &s;leep upon; and many are merely ornamental. The la&s;t are principally made from the rough, membraneous part of the &s;tock of the plantain-tree; tho&s;e that they wear, are generally
<PB N="287" REF="030274_0346_0FE56CF67A1EF7A0">
compo&s;ed of the <HI>pandanus</HI>; and the coar&s;er kind, on which they &s;leep, are formed from a plant called <HI>evarra.</HI> There are &s;everal other articles of le&s;s importance, that employ their females; as combs, of which they make great quantities; and &s;mall ba&s;kets made of the &s;ame &s;ub&s;tance as the mats, and others compo&s;ed of the fibrous hu&s;k of the cocoa-nut, either interwoven with beads, or plain; all which are fini&s;hed with ex|traordinary neatne&s;s and ta&s;te.</P>
<P>The province of the men is, as might rea&s;on|ably be expected, far more laborious and exten|&s;ive than that of the other &s;ex. Architecture, boat-building, agriculture, and fi&s;hing, are the principal objects of their care. As cultivated roots and fruits form their chief &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, they find it nece&s;&s;ary to practi&s;e hu&s;bandry, which they have brought by their diligence to &s;ome degree of perfection. In planting yams and plantains they dig &s;mall holes for their reception, and after|wards root up the &s;urrounding gra&s;s. The in|&s;truments u&s;ed by them for this purpo&s;e, are call|ed <HI>hooo;</HI> and are nothing more than &s;takes of various lengths, flattened and &s;harpened to an edge at one end; and the large&s;t ones have a &s;hort piece fixed tran&s;ver&s;ely, by means of which they pre&s;s the implement into the ground with the foot. When they plant the two above-men|tioned vegetables, they ob&s;erve &s;uch particu|lar exactne&s;s, that, whichever way you turn your
<PB N="288" REF="030274_0347_0FE56DE7A689D840">
eyes, the rows pre&s;ent them&s;elves complete and regular.</P>
<P>The bread-fruit and cocoa-nut-trees are di&s;|per&s;ed about, without any order; and when they have arrived at a certain height, give them little or no trouble. The &s;ame may be &s;aid of ano|ther large tree, which produces a roundi&s;h com|pre&s;&s;ed nut, called <HI>ecefee</HI>; and of a &s;maller tree being an oval nut, with two or three triangular kernels. The <HI>kappe</HI> is in general, planted re|gularly and in large &s;pots but the <HI>mawhaha</HI> is inter&s;per&s;ed among other things, as are al&s;o the yams and <HI>jeejee.</HI> Sugar-cane is u&s;ually in &s;mall &s;pots, clo&s;ely crowded. The mulberry, of which the cloth is made, is kept very clean, and has a good &s;pace allowed for it. The <HI>pandanus</HI> is com|monly planted in a row, clo&s;e together, at the &s;ides of the fields.</P>
<P>They di&s;play very little ta&s;te or ingenuity in the con&s;truction of their hou&s;es. Tho&s;e of the lower cla&s;s of people are wretched huts, &s;carce &s;ufficient to &s;helter them from the weather. Tho&s;e of the better &s;ort are larger, as well as more commodious and comfortable. A hou&s;e of a middling &s;ize is of following dimen&s;ions, viz, about twelve in height, twenty in breadth, and thirty in length. Their hou&s;es are, properly &s;peaking, thatched roofs or &s;heds, &s;upported by rafters and po&s;ts. The floor is rai&s;ed with earth &s;moothed, and covered with thick matting. Some
<PB N="289" REF="030274_0348_0FE56DE9AD51BEE0">
of their habitations are open all round: but the major part of them are enclo&s;ed on the weather &s;ide with &s;trong mats, or with branches of the cocoa-nut tree, plated or interwoven with each other. A thick mat, about three feet broad, bent into a &s;emicircular form, and placed edgeways, with the ends touching the &s;ide of the hou&s;e, en|clo&s;es a &s;ufficient &s;pace for the ma&s;ter and mi&s;tre&s;s to &s;leep in. The re&s;t of the family &s;leep upon any part of the floor, the unmarried men and women lying apart from each other. If the fami|ly is large, there are little huts adjoining, in which the &s;ervants &s;leep. Their whole furniture con&s;i&s;ts of &s;ome wooden &s;tools, which &s;erve them for pillows; ba&s;kets of different &s;izes, in which they put their combs, fi&s;h-hooks, and tools; two or three wooden bowls, in which they make <HI>kava;</HI> &s;ome cocoa-nut &s;hells, a few gourds, and a bundle or two of cloth.</P>
<P>They are very &s;killful in building their canoes which, indeed, are the mo&s;t perfect of their me|chanical productions. The double ones are made &s;ufficiently large to carry about fifty per|&s;ons, and &s;ail at a great rate. Upon them they generally fix a hut or &s;hed, for the reception of the ma&s;ter and his family. They are made of the bread-fruit tree, and the workman&s;hip is extremely neat. They appear on the out&s;ide as if they where compo&s;ed of one &s;olid piece; but, upon clo&s;e in&s;pection, they are found to con&s;i&s;t
<PB N="290" REF="030274_0349_0FE56DEDC8C911B8">
of a great number of pieces, which fit each other exactly, and by means of a ledge on the in&s;ide are &s;ecured together with cocoa-nut line. The &s;ingle canoes are furni&s;hed with an outrigger. The only tools which they make u&s;e of in the con|&s;truction of the&s;e boats, are hatchets, or adzes, of a &s;mooth black &s;tone; augers, made of &s;hirk's teeth; and ra&s;ps, compo&s;ed of the rough &s;kin of a fi&s;h, fa&s;tened on flat pieces of wood. The &s;ame tools are all they have for other works, except &s;hells, which &s;erve them for knives. Their cor|dage is made of the fibres of the cocoa-nut hu&s;k, which; though not above ten inches long, they plait about the &s;ize of a quill, to whatever length is required, and roll it up in balls; from which the ropes of a larger &s;ize are made, by twi&s;ting &s;everal of tho&s;e together. Their fi&s;hing-lines are as &s;trong and even as our be&s;t cord. Their &s;mall hooks con&s;i&s;t entirely of pearl-&s;hell; but the large ones are only covered with it on the back; and the points of both are, in general, of tortoi&s;e-&s;hell. With the large hooks they catch albicores, and bonnetos, by putting them to a bamboo-rod, about twelve feet long, with a line of the &s;ame length. They have al&s;o numbers of &s;mall &s;eines, &s;ome of which are of the mo&s;t delicate texture.</P>
<P>Their mu&s;ical reeds or pipes, which re&s;emble the <HI>&s;yrinx</HI> of the ancients, have eight or ten pieces placed parallel to each other, mo&s;t of which are
<PB N="291" REF="030274_0350_0FE56DEFEE756308">
of unequal lengths. Their flutes are made of a joint of bamboo, about eighteen inches long, and are clo&s;ed at both ends, having a hole near each end, and four others; two of which, and only one of the fir&s;t, are u&s;ed by them in playing. They clo&s;e the left no&s;tril with the thumb of the left-hand, and blow into the hole at one end with the other no&s;tril. The fore-finger of the right-hand is applied to the lowe&s;t hole on the right, and the middle finger of the left, to the fir&s;t hole on that &s;ide. In this manner, with only three notes, they produce a plea&s;ing, though &s;imple, mu&s;ic. Their <HI>naffa,</HI> or drum, has been already de&s;cribed.</P>
<P>Their warlike weapons are clubs, curiou&s;ly or|namented, &s;pears, and darts. They al&s;o make bows and arrows; but the&s;e are intended for amu&s;ement, &s;uch as &s;hooting at birds, and not for the purpo&s;es of war. Their &s;tools, or rather pillows, are about two feet long, but only four or five inches in height, and near four in breadth, inclining downwards towards the middle, with four &s;trong legs and circular feet; the whole compo&s;ed of brown or black wood, neatly po|li&s;hed, and &s;ometimes inlaid with ivory. They likewi&s;e inlay with ivory the handles of fly-flaps and, with a &s;hark's tooth, &s;hape bones into figures of men, birds. &amp;c.</P>
<P>Their vegetable diet principally con&s;i&s;ts of plantains, cocoa-nuts, bread-fruit, and yams.
<PB N="292" REF="030274_0351_0FE56DF1C869E288">
Their chief articles of animal food are hogs, fi&s;h, and fowls; but the common people frequently eat rats. The hogs, fowls, and turtle, however, &s;eem to be only occa&s;ional dainties, re&s;erved for per&s;ons of rank. Their food is, in general, dre&s;&s;ed by baking, as at Otaheite; and they make, from different &s;orts of fruit, &s;everal di&s;hes, which are very good. They &s;ometimes boil their fi&s;h in the green leaves of the plantain-tree, which &s;erve as a bay to hold both fi&s;h and water: having tied them up, they wrap them again in three or four other leaves, and place them upon &s;tones heated for the purpo&s;e: when they are &s;ufficient|ly done, they not only eat the fi&s;h, but drink the liquor or &s;oup. They are not very cleanly either in their cookery, or their manner of eating. Their u&s;ual drink at their meals is water, or cocoa-nut milk, the <HI>kava</HI> being only their morning beve|rage. The food that is &s;erved up to the chiefs, is generally laid upon plantain-leaves. The king, at his meals, was commonly attended upon by three or four of the natives, one of whom cut large pieces of the fi&s;h, or of the joint, another afterwards divided it into mouthfuls, and the re&s;t &s;tood by with cocoa-nuts, and whatever el&s;e he might happen to want. We never ob&s;erved a large company &s;it down to a &s;ociable meal, by eating from the &s;ame di&s;h. The women are not excluded from taking their meals with the men; but there are certain ranks that are not allowed
<PB N="293" REF="030274_0352_0FE56DF34FD74C40">
either to eat or drink together. This di&s;tinction begins with his maje&s;ty, but we know not where it ends.</P>
<P>They ri&s;e at day-break, and retire to re&s;t as &s;oon as it becomes dark. They, for the mo&s;t part, &s;leep al&s;o in the day time, when the weather is very hot. They are fond of a&s;&s;ociating together; in con&s;equence of which, it is not uncommon to find &s;everal hou&s;es empty, and the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of them a&s;&s;embled in &s;ome other hou&s;e, or upon &s;ome convenient &s;pot in the neighbourhood, where they relax them&s;elves by conver&s;ation and other amu&s;ements. Their private diver&s;ions chiefly con&s;i&s;t of dancing, &s;inging, and mu&s;ic. When two or three women &s;nap their fingers, and &s;ing in concert, it is called <HI>oobai;</HI> but when there are more, they form &s;everal parties, each of which &s;ings in a different key, which con&s;titutes an agreeable melody, and is termed <HI>heeva</HI> or <HI>haiva.</HI> The &s;ongs are generally accompanied with the mu&s;ic of their flutes. The dances both of the men and women, are performed with an ea&s;e and grace which are difficult to be de&s;cribed.</P>
<P>We could not determine with preci&s;ion, whe|ther their marriages were rendered durable by any kind of &s;olemn contract: it is certain, how|ever, that the major part of the people contented them&s;elves with one wife. The chiefs, indeed, commonly have &s;everal women, though there was only one who (as we thought) was con&s;i|dered
<PB N="294" REF="030274_0353_0FE56DF7E5413B40">
in the light of mi&s;tre&s;s of the family. Though female cha&s;tity &s;eemed to beheld in lit|tle e&s;timation, not a &s;ingle breach of conjugal fidelity happened, to our knowledge, during our whole continuance at the&s;e i&s;lands; nor were the unmarried women of rank more liberal of their favours. But there were great numbers of a very different character.</P>
<P>The concern &s;hewn by the&s;e i&s;landers for the dead, is a &s;trong proof of their humanity. Be|&s;ides the <HI>tooge,</HI> which we have mentioned before, and burnt circles and &s;cars, they &s;trike a &s;hark's tooth into their heads till the blood flows con|&s;iderably, beat their teeth with &s;tones, and thru&s;t &s;pears not only through their cheeks into their mouths, but al&s;o into the inner part of their thighs, and into their &s;ides. The more painful operations, however, are only practi&s;ed when they mourn the death of tho&s;e who were mo&s;t nearly connected with them. When one of them dies, he is wrapped up in mats and cloth, and then in|terred. The <HI>&s;iatookas</HI> &s;eem to be appropriated to the chiefs and other per&s;ons of di&s;tinction, as their burial-places; but the inferior people have no particular &s;pot &s;et apart for their interment. It is uncertain what part of the mourning ceremony follows immediately afterwards; but there is &s;ome|thing be&s;ides the general one which is continued for a con&s;iderable time, the funeral of Mareewagee's wife being attended with ceremonies of five days duration. They &s;eem to con&s;ider death as a great
<PB N="295" REF="030274_0354_0FE56DFA0CC7E190">
evil, to avert which they practi&s;e a very &s;ingular cu&s;tom. When Captain Cook, during his &s;econd voyage, fir&s;t vi&s;ited the&s;e i&s;lands, he ob&s;erved that many of the natives had one on both of their little fingers cut off; of the rea&s;on of which mu|tilation he could not then obtain a &s;atisfactory account. But he was now informed, that they perform this operation when they are afflicted with &s;ome dangerous di&s;order, which they ima|gine may bring them to the grave. They &s;uppo&s;e that the little finger will be accepted of by the Deity, as a kind of propitiatory &s;acrifice &s;uffici|ently efficacious to procure their recovery. In cutting it off, they make u&s;e of a &s;tone-hatchet. There was &s;carcely one per&s;on in ten who was not thus mutilated; and they &s;ometimes cut &s;o clo&s;e, as to encroach upon that bone of the hand which joins the amputated finger. It is al&s;o common for the lower cla&s;s of people to cut off a joint of their little finger, on account of the &s;ickne&s;s of the chiefs to whom they re&s;pectively belong.</P>
<P>When the rigid &s;trictne&s;s with which they per|form their mourning and religious ceremonies is con&s;idered, it might be expected, that they en|deavoured thereby to &s;ecure to them&s;elves eternal happine&s;s: but their principal object regards things merely temporal; for they have apparently little conception of future puni&s;hment for &s;ins committed in the pre&s;ent life. They believe, how|ever,
<PB N="296" REF="030274_0355_0FE56DFD87F15728">
that they meet with ju&s;t puni&s;hment upon earth; and, therefore, put every method in prac|tice to render their divinities propitious. They admit a plurality of deities, all of them inferior to <HI>Kallafootonga,</HI> who they &s;ay is a female, and the &s;upreme author of mo&s;t things, re&s;iding in the heavens, and directing the wind, rain, thunder, &amp;c. They are of opinion, that when &s;he is much di&s;plea&s;ed with them, the productions of the earth are bla&s;ted, many things con&s;umed by lightning, and them&s;elves afflicted with &s;ickne&s;s and death; but that when her anger abates, every thing is immediately re&s;tored to its former &s;tate. Among their &s;urbordinate deities, they mention <HI>Futtafaihe,</HI> or <HI>Foota&s;ooa,</HI> who has the admini&s;tration of the &s;ea, and its productions; <HI>Toofooa-boolootoo,</HI> god of the clouds and fog; <HI>Talloteboo, Mattaba, Tareeava,</HI> and others. The &s;ame &s;y&s;tem of religion does not extend all over the Friendly I&s;lands; the &s;upreme deity of Hapaee, for in&s;tance, being called <HI>Alo Alo.</HI> They entertain very ab&s;urd opinions rela|tive to the power and various attributes of the&s;e beings, who, they &s;uppo&s;e, have no further con|cern with them after death. They have, however, ju&s;ter &s;entiments re&s;pecting the immortality and immateriality of the &s;oul; which they call life the living principle, or an <HI>O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ooa,</HI> that is, a divi|nity. They imagine that, immediately after death, the &s;ouls of their chiefs are &s;eparated from their bodies, and go to a delightful region called
<PB N="297" REF="030274_0356_0FE56E0977216358">
<HI>Boolootoo,</HI> the god of which is named <HI>Gooleho.</HI> By this <HI>Gooleho</HI> they probably per&s;onify death. His country, according to their mythology, is the general repo&s;itory of the dead; and tho&s;e who are once conveyed thither, are no more &s;ubject to death, but fea&s;t on all the favourite productions of their native &s;oil, with which this bli&s;sful abode is plentifully furni&s;hed. As for the &s;ouls of peo|ple of an inferior cla&s;s, they are &s;uppo&s;ed by them to &s;uffer a kind of tran&s;migration; or are eaten up (they &s;ay) by a bird called <HI>loata,</HI> which walks upon the graves with that intent.</P>
<P>They do nor wor&s;hip any vi&s;ible part of the creation, or any thing made by their own hands. They make no offerings of dogs, hogs, and fruit (as is the cu&s;tom at Otaheite) unle&s;s emblamati|cally. But there &s;eems to be no rea&s;on to doubt of their offering up human &s;acrifices. Their <HI>fia|tookas,</HI> or <HI>morais,</HI> are, in general, burying-grounds and places of wor&s;hip: &s;ome of them, however, appeared to be appropriated only to the former purpo&s;e; but the&s;e were &s;mall and greatly inferior to the re&s;t.</P>
<P>We are very little acquainted with their form of government. A &s;ubordination, re&s;embling the feudal &s;y&s;tem of our ance&s;tors in Europe, is e&s;ta|bli&s;hed among them; but of its &s;ubdivi&s;ions, and the con&s;tituent parts we are ignorant. Though &s;ome of them informed us, that the king's power is unbounded, and that he has the ab&s;olute di&s;|po&s;al
<PB N="298" REF="030274_0357_0FE56E0B3781F218">
of the lives and properties of his &s;ubjects; yet the few circum&s;tances that offered them&s;elves to our ob&s;ervation, contradicted, rather than con|firmed, the idea of de&s;potic &s;way. Mareewagee, Feenou, and Old Toobou, acted each the part of a petty &s;overeign, and not unfrequently counter|acted the mea&s;ures of the king. Nor was his court &s;uperior in &s;plendor, to tho&s;e of Old Toobou and Mareewagee, who, next to his maje&s;ty, were the mo&s;t potent chiefs in the&s;e i&s;lands; and, next after them, Feenou appeared to &s;tand highe&s;t in rank and authority. But however independent on the king the principal men may be the infe|rior people are totally &s;ubject to the will of the chiefs to whom they &s;everally belong.</P>
<P>The i&s;land of Tongataboo is divided into nu|merous di&s;tricts, each of which has its peculiar chief, who di&s;tributes ju&s;tice, and decides di&s;putes, within his own territory. Mo&s;t of the&s;e chief|tains have e&s;tates in other i&s;lands, whence they procure &s;upplies. The king, at &s;tated times, re|ceives the product of his di&s;tant domains at Ton|gataboo, which is not only the u&s;ual place of his re&s;idence, but the abode of mo&s;t per&s;ons of di&s;|tinction among the&s;e i&s;lands. Its inhabitants fre|quently call it the Land of Chiefs, and &s;tigmatize the &s;ubordinate i&s;les with the appellation of Lands of Servants.</P>
<P>The chiefs are &s;tilled by the people lords of the earth, and al&s;o of the &s;un and &s;ky. The royal

family a&s;&s;ume the name of Futtafaihe, from the god di&s;tingui&s;hed by that appellation, who is pro|bably con&s;idered by them as their tutelary patron. The king's peculiar title is &s;imply <HI>Tooee Tonga.</HI> The order and decorum ob&s;erved in his pre&s;ence, and likewi&s;e in that of the other chiefs, are truly admirable. Whenever he &s;its down, all the at|tendants &s;eat them&s;elves before him, forming a &s;emi-circle, and leaving a &s;ufficient &s;pace between them and him, into which no one, unle&s;s he has particular bu&s;ine&s;s, pre&s;umes to come. Nor is any one &s;uffered to &s;it, or pa&s;s, behind him, or even near him, without his permi&s;&s;ion. When a per&s;on wi&s;hes to &s;peak to his maje&s;ty, he comes forward, and having &s;eated him&s;elf before him, delivers in a few words what he has to &s;ay; then, after being favoured with an an&s;wer, retires. If the king &s;peaks to any one, the latter gives an an&s;wer from his &s;eat, unle&s;s he is to receive an order; in which ca&s;e he ri&s;es from his place, and &s;eats him&s;elf cro&s;s-legged<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It may be proper to mention here, on the authority of Captain King, that this po&s;ture is peculiar to the men&punc; for the females always &s;it with both their legs thrown a little on one &s;ide.</NOTE> before his maje&s;ty. To &s;peak to the king &s;tanding, would here be con&s;idered as a glaring mark of rudene&s;s.</P>
<P>None of the mo&s;t civilized nations have ever exceeded the&s;e i&s;landers in the great order and regularity maintained on every occa&s;ion, in ready
<PB N="300" REF="030274_0359_0FE56E0E4F6646A8">
and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive compliance with the commands of their chiefs, and in the perfect harmony that &s;ub|&s;i&s;ts among all ranks. Such a behaviour mani|fe&s;ts it&s;elf in a remarkable manner, whenever their chiefs harrangue a body of them a&s;&s;embled toge|ther, which frequently happens. The greate&s;t attention and mo&s;t profound &s;ilence are ob&s;erved during the harrangue; and whatever might have been the purport of the oration, we never &s;aw a &s;ingle in&s;tance, when any one of tho&s;e who were pre&s;ent &s;hewed &s;igns of his being di&s;plea&s;ed, or &s;eemed in the lea&s;t inclined to di&s;pute the declared will of the &s;peaker.</P>
<P>It is a peculiar privilege annexed to the per&s;on of the king, not to be punctured, nor circum|ci&s;ed, or rather &s;uperci&s;ed, as all his &s;ubjects are. Whenever he walks out all who meet him mu&s;t &s;it down till he has pa&s;&s;ed. No per&s;on is &s;uffered to be over his head; but, on the contrary, all mu&s;t come under his feet. The method of doing homage to him, and the other chiefs is as fol|lows: the per&s;on who is to pay obei&s;ance, &s;quats down before the great per&s;onage, and bows the head down to the &s;ole of his foot, which he taps or touches with the under and upper &s;ide of the fingers of each hand; then ri&s;ing up, he retires. We had rea&s;on to think, that his maje&s;ty cannot refu&s;e any one who is de&s;irous of paying him this homage, which is called by the natives <HI>moe moca;</HI> for the people would frequently think proper to
<PB N="301" REF="030274_0360_0FE56E1621886190">
&s;hew him the&s;e marks of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion when he was walking; and he was on tho&s;e occa&s;ions obliged to &s;top, and hold up one of his feet behind him, till they had performed this re&s;pectful ceremony. This, to &s;o corpulent and unwieldy a man as Poulaho, mu&s;t have been painful and trouble&s;ome; and we have &s;ome times &s;een him endeavour, by running, to get out of the way, or to reach a con|venient place for &s;itting down. The hands after having been thus applied, becomes, in &s;ome ca&s;es, u&s;ele&s;s for a little time; for, till they are wa&s;hed, they mu&s;t not touch food of any &s;ort. This pro|hibition, in a country where water is far from being plentiful, would be attended with incon|venience, if a piece of any juicy plant, which they can immediately procure, being rubbed over the hands, did not &s;erve for the purpo&s;e of puri|fication. When the hands are in this &s;ituation, they term it <HI>taboo rema</HI>; the former word gene|rally &s;ignifying forbidden, and the latter imply|ing hand. When the <HI>taboo</HI> is incurred, by doing homage to a per&s;on of rank, it may thus ea&s;ily be wa&s;hed off; but, in &s;everal other ca&s;es, it mu&s;t continue for a certain period. We have often &s;een women, who have been <HI>taboo rema,</HI> not fed by them&s;elves, but by others. The interdicted per&s;on, after the limited time had elap&s;ed, wa&s;hes her&s;elf in one of their bathes, which are, in ge|neral, dirty ponds of bracki&s;h water. She then waits upon the &s;overeign, and, after having paid

the cu&s;tomary obei&s;ance, takes hold of his foot, which &s;he applies to her &s;houlders, brea&s;t, and other parts: he then embraces her on both &s;houl|ders, and &s;he immediately retires, purified from her uncleanne&s;s. If it be always nece&s;&s;ary to have recour&s;e to his maje&s;ty for this purpo&s;e (of which we are not certain, though Omai a&s;&s;ured us it was) it may be one rea&s;on for his travelling very frequently from one i&s;land to another.</P>
<P>The word <HI>taboo</HI> has a great latitude of &s;igni|fication. They call human &s;acrifices <HI>tangata taboo</HI>; and when any particular thing is prohibited to be eaten, or made u&s;e of, they &s;ay it is <HI>taboo.</HI> They informed us, that, if the king &s;hould go into a hou&s;e belonging to one of his &s;ubject, that hou&s;e would in con&s;equence become <HI>taboo,</HI> and could never be again inhabited by the owner of it; &s;o that, wherever his maje&s;ty travels, there are hou&s;es peculiarly a&s;&s;igned for his accommodation. At this time, Old Toobou pre&s;ided over the <HI>taboo</HI>; that is, if Omai did not mi&s;under&s;tand tho&s;e who gave him the intelligence, he and his deputies had the in&s;pection of all the produce of the i&s;land, taking care that each individual &s;hould cultivate and plant his quota, and directing what &s;hould, and what &s;hould not, be eaten. By &s;o prudent a regulation, they take effectual precautions again&s;t a famine; &s;ufficient ground is employed in rai&s;ing provi&s;ions; and every article is &s;ecured from un|nece&s;&s;ary con&s;umption. By another good regu|lation,
<PB N="303" REF="030274_0362_0FE56E195183DB30">
an officer of rank is appointed to &s;uper|intend the police. This department was admi|ni&s;tered, while we continued among them, by Feenou, who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s (as we were informed) it was, to puni&s;h all delinquents: he was al&s;o gene|rali&s;&s;imo, or commander in chief of the forces of the i&s;lands. Poulaho him&s;elf declared to us, that, if he &s;hould become a bad man, Feenou would dethrone, and kill him; by which he doubtle&s;s meant, that, if he neglected the duties of his high &s;tation, or governed in a manner that would prove prejudicial to the public welfare, Feenou would be de&s;ired, by the other chiefs, or by the collective body of the people, to depo&s;e him from his &s;overeignty, and put him to death. A mo|narch thus &s;ubject to controul and puni&s;hment for abu&s;e of power, cannot ju&s;tly be deemed a de&s;potic prince.</P>
<P>When we take into con&s;ideration the mumber of i&s;lands of which this &s;tate con&s;i&s;ts, and the di&s;|tance at which &s;ome of them are removed from the &s;eat of government, attempts to throw off the yoke of &s;ubjection might be apprehended. But they informed us, that this circum&s;tance never happens. One rea&s;on of their not being thus em|broiled in dome&s;tic commotions may be this; that all the principal chiefs take up their re&s;idence at Tongataboo. They al&s;o &s;ecure the dependence of the other i&s;les, by the deci&s;ive celerity of their operations; for if a &s;editious and popular man
<PB N="304" REF="030274_0363_0FE56E1AD9DD2B88">
&s;hould &s;tart up in any of them, Feenou, or who|ever happens to hold his office, is immediately di&s;patched thither to put him to death, by which means they extingui&s;h an in&s;urrection while it is yet in embryo.</P>
<P>The different cla&s;&s;es of their chiefs &s;eemed to be nearly as numerous as among us; but there are few, comparatively &s;peaking, that are lords of exten&s;ive di&s;tricts of territory. It is &s;aid, that, when a per&s;on of property dies, all his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions devolve on the &s;overeign; but that it is cu&s;tomary to give them to the elde&s;t &s;on of the decea&s;ed, with this condition annexed, that he &s;hould pro|vide, out of the e&s;tate, for the other children. The crown is hereditary; and we know, from a particular circum&s;tance, that the Futtafaihes, of which family is Poulaho, have reigned, in a di|rect line, for the &s;pace of at lea&s;t one hundred and thirty-five years, which have elap&s;ed between our pre&s;ent vi&s;it to the&s;e i&s;lands, and Ta&s;man's di&s;covery of them. Upon our inquiring of them, whether any traditional account of the arrival of Ta&s;man's &s;hips had been pre&s;erved among them till this time, we found, that this hi&s;tory had been delivered down to them, from their ance&s;tors, with great accuracy: for they &s;aid that his two &s;hips re&s;embled ours, and al&s;o mentioned the place where they had lain at anchor, their having continued but a few days, and their quitting that &s;tation to go to Annamoka; and for the pur|po&s;e
<PB N="305" REF="030274_0364_0FE56E1E6CF88320">
of informing us how long ago this affair had happened, they communicated to us the name of the Futtafaihe who reigned at that time and tho&s;e who had &s;ucceeded him in the &s;overeignty, down to Poulaho, who, is the fifth monarch &s;ince that period.</P>
<P>It might naturally be imagined, that the pre|&s;ent &s;overeign of the Friendly I&s;les had the highe&s;t rank of any per&s;on in his dominions. But we found it to be otherwi&s;e; for Latoolibooloo, who has been already mentioned, and three women, are &s;uperior, in &s;ome re&s;pects, to Poulaho him|&s;elf. Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e great per&s;onages are di&s;tingui&s;hed by the title of <HI>Tammaha,</HI> which implies a chief. When we made inquiry concerning them, we were informed that the late king, father of Poulaho, left behind, him a &s;i&s;ter of equal rank, and older than him&s;elf; that &s;he, by a native of Feejee, had a &s;on and two Daughters; and that the&s;e three per&s;ons, as well as their mother, are of higher rank than the king. We endeavoured to di&s;co|ver the rea&s;on of this pre-eminence of the <HI>Tam|mahas,</HI> but without effect. The mother, and one of her daughters, named Tooeela-kaipa, re&s;ide at Vavaoo. The other daughter, called Moungoula|kaipa, and, Latoolibooloo the &s;on, dwell at Ton|gataboo. Moungoula-kaipa is the lady who has been mentioned as having dined with Captain Cook on the 21&s;t of June. Latoolibooloo was

&s;uppo&s;ed, by his countrymen, to be di&s;ordered in his &s;en&s;es. At Eooa, or Middleburgh, they &s;hewed us a con&s;iderable quantity of land, which was &s;aid to be his property; and we &s;aw there a &s;on of his, a child who was honoured with the &s;ame title that his father enjoyed.</P>
<P>The language of the&s;e i&s;lands bears a &s;triking re&s;emblance to that of New-Zealand, of Otaheite, and the Society I&s;les. The pronunciation of the&s;e people differs, indeed, in many in&s;tances, from that both of Otaheite and New-Zealand; but, notwith&s;tanding, that, a great number of words are either very little changed, or exactly the &s;ame. The language, as &s;poken by the Friendly I&s;lan|ders, is &s;ufficiently copious to expre&s;s all their ideas; and, be&s;ides being tolerably harmonious in common conver&s;ation, is ea&s;ily adapted to the purpo&s;es of mu&s;ic.

<P>The latitude of that part of Tongataboo where our ob&s;ervatory was erected, which was near the middle of the north-&s;ide of the i&s;land, was, ac|cording to the mo&s;t accurate ob&s;ervations, 21&deg; 8&prime; 19&Prime; &s;outh; and its longitude was 184&deg; 55&Prime; 18&Prime; ea&s;t.</P>

<P>WE had now taken our final leave of the Friendly I&s;lands. On the 17th of July, at eight o'clock in the evening. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ooa bore north|ea&s;t
<PB N="309" REF="030274_0368_0FE56E59AED7DDF8">
by north, di&s;tant three or four leagues. The wind blew a fre&s;h gale at ea&s;t. We &s;tood to the &s;outh, till about &s;ix o'clock the next morning, when, from the &s;ame direction, a &s;udden &s;quall took our &s;hip aback; and before we could trim the &s;hips on the other tack, the main-&s;ail and the top-gallant &s;ails were con&s;iderably torn.</P>
<P>On the 19th and 20th, the wind kept between the &s;outh-we&s;t, and &s;outh-ea&s;t; then it veered to the ea&s;t, north-ea&s;t, and north.</P>
<P>We &s;tretched to the ea&s;t &s;outh-ea&s;t, without meeting with any thing remarkable, till the 29th, at &s;even o'clock in the evening, when we had a very heavy &s;quall of wind from the north. We were, at this time, under &s;ingle-reefed top-&s;ails, cour&s;es, and &s;tay-&s;ails. Two of the latter were almo&s;t demoli&s;hed by the wind, and it was with the utmo&s;t difficulty that we &s;aved the other &s;ails. This &s;quall being over, we &s;aw &s;everal lights mov|ing about on board the Di&s;covery; whence we con|jectured that &s;omething had given way; and, the next morning, we perceived that her main-top-ma&s;t had been lo&s;t. Both wind and weather re|mained very un&s;ettled till noon, when the latter cleared up, and the former &s;ettled in the north-we&s;t quarter. We were now in the latitude of 28&deg; 6&prime; &s;outh, and our longitude was 198&deg; 23&prime; ea&s;t. We &s;aw &s;ome pintado-birds, which were the fir&s;t we had &s;een &s;ince we left the land.</P>
<P><PB N="210" REF="030274_0369_0FE56E37A189AD98">At noon, on the 31&s;t, Captain Clerke made a &s;ignal to &s;peak with Captain Cook; and after|wards informed him, that the head of the main-ma&s;t had &s;prung, and in &s;uch a manner as to reader the rigging of another top-ma&s;t extremely dangerous; that he mu&s;t therefore rig &s;omething lighter in its place. He further informed him, that he had lo&s;t his main-top-gallant-yard: and had not another on board, nor a &s;par to make one. Captain Cook &s;ent him the Re&s;olution's &s;prit-&s;ail-top-fail-yard, which &s;upplied this want for the pre&s;ent. The next day, by getting up a jury-top-ma&s;t, on which he &s;et a mizen-top-&s;ail, he was enabled to keep way with the Re&s;olution.</P>
<P>We &s;teered ea&s;t-north-ea&s;t, and north-ea&s;t, without meeting with any remarkable occurrence till the morning of the 8th of Augu&s;t, at eleven o'clock; when land was ob&s;erved bearing north-north-ea&s;t, about nine or ten leagues di&s;tant. At fir&s;t it appeared like &s;o many &s;eparate i&s;lands; but, as we approached, we found it was all con|nected, and formed one and the &s;ame i&s;land. We &s;teered directly for it with a fine gale, and, at half pa&s;t &s;ix in the afternoon, it extended from north by ea&s;t, to north-north-ea&s;t, di&s;tant three or four leagues.</P>
<P>At day-break, the next morning, we &s;teered for the north-we&s;t &s;ide of the i&s;land, and as we &s;tood round its &s;outh-we&s;t part, we &s;aw it guard|ed by a reef of coral rock, extending, in &s;ome

places, at lea&s;t a mile from the land, and a high &s;urf breaking upon it. As we drew near, we &s;aw people walking or running along &s;hore, on &s;eve|ral parts of the coa&s;t, and, in a &s;hort time after, when we had reached the lee-&s;ide of the i&s;land, we &s;aw two canoes launched, in which were about a dozen men who paddled towards us.</P>
<P>In order to give the&s;e canoes time to come up with us, as well as to &s;ound for anchorage, we &s;hortened &s;ail; and, at the di&s;tance of half a mile from the reef, we found from forty to thirty-five fathoms water. The canoes, after having ad|vanced within pi&s;tol-&s;hot of the &s;hips, &s;uddenly &s;topped. Omai was de&s;ired, as was u&s;ual on &s;uch occa&s;ions, to endeavour to prevail upon the men in them to come nearer; but no arguments could induce them to tru&s;t them&s;elves within our reach. They often pointed eagerly to the &s;hore with their paddles, at the &s;ame time calling to us to go thither; and many of their people who were &s;tanding upon the beach, held up &s;omething white in their hands, which we con&s;trued as an invitation for us to land. We could ea&s;ily have accompli&s;hed this, there being good anchorage without the reef, and an opening in it, through which the canoes had pa&s;&s;ed, which had no &s;urf upon it. But the Captain did not chu&s;e to ri&s;k the advantage of a fair wind, in order to examine an i&s;land, that appeared to be but of little con|&s;equence. We required no refre&s;hments, if we
<PB N="312" REF="030274_0371_0FE56E319094B488">
had been certain of meeting with them there, and therefore, after making &s;everal un&s;ucce&s;sful attempts to prevail upon the&s;e people to come near us, we made &s;ail to the north, and left them; having fir&s;t learned that the name of their i&s;land was Toobouai. It is &s;ituated in the latitude of 23&deg; 25&prime; &s;outh; and in 210&deg; 37&prime; ea&s;t longitude.</P>
<P>The greate&s;t extent of this i&s;land, in any di|rection, is not above five or &s;ix miles. Small, however, as it appears, there are hills in it of a con&s;iderable elevation; at the foot of which, is a narrow border of flat land, extending almo&s;t all round it, bordered with a white &s;and-beach. The hills were covered with herbage, except a few rocky cliffs, with patches of trees inter&s;per&s;ed to their &s;ummits. This i&s;land, as we were inform|ed by the men in the canoes, is plentifully &s;tocked with hogs and fowls; and produces the &s;everal kinds of fruits and roots that are to be met with at the other i&s;lands in this neighbourhood.</P>
<P>From the conver&s;ation we had with tho&s;e who came off to us, we di&s;covered that the inhabitants of Toobouai &s;peak the Otaheite language; an indubitable proof that they are of the &s;ame na|tion. Tho&s;e whom we &s;aw in the canoes were a &s;tout copper-coloured people; &s;ome wearing their hair (which was &s;traight and black) flowing about the &s;houlders, and others having it tied in a bunch on the crown of the head. Their faces were roundi&s;h and full, but the features flat; and their
<PB N="313" REF="030274_0372_0FE56E4724DD31E0">
countenance expre&s;&s;ed a degree of natural fero|city. Their covering was a piece of narrow &s;tuff wrapped round the wai&s;t, and pa&s;&s;ing between the thighs; but &s;ome of tho&s;e whom we beheld upon the beach, were compleatly clothed in white. Some of our vi&s;itors in the canoes, had their necks ornamented with pearl &s;hells; and one of them continued blowing a large conch&s;hell, to which a reed, of about two feet long, was fixed; he began in a long tone, without any variation; and afterwards converted it into a kind of mu&s;ical in&s;trument. Whether the blowing of the conch portended any thing, we cannot &s;ay, but we never found it the me&s;&s;enger of peace.</P>
<P>The length of their canoes appeared to be about thirty feet, and they ro&s;e about two feet above the &s;urface of the water, as they floated. The fore|part projected a little; the after-part ro&s;e to the height of two or three feet, with a gradual curve, and, like the upper part of the &s;ides, was carved all over. The re&s;t of the &s;ides were ornamented with flat white &s;hells curiou&s;ly di&s;po&s;ed. There were eight men in one of the canoes, and &s;even in the other. They were conducted with &s;mall pad|dles, who&s;e blades were almo&s;t circular; and they &s;ometimes paddled, with the two oppo&s;ite &s;ides &s;o clo&s;e together, that they appeared to be but one boat; the rowers occa&s;ionally turning their faces to the &s;tern, and pulling that way, without pad|dling the canoes round. Seeing we were de|termined
<PB N="314" REF="030274_0373_0FE56E39E3413138">
to leave them, they &s;tood up, and re|peated &s;omething aloud; but we knew not whe|ther they were expre&s;&s;ing their enmity, or friend|&s;hip. It is certain, however, that they had not any weapons with them; nor could we with our gla&s;&s;es di&s;cover, that tho&s;e on &s;hore were armed.</P>
<P>Leaving the i&s;land, we &s;teered to the north with a fre&s;h gale, and, at day-break, on the 12th, we perceived the i&s;land of Maitea. Otaheite ap|peared &s;oon after; the point of Oheitepeha-bay bearing we&s;t, about four leagues di&s;tant. We &s;teered for this bay, intending to anchor there, in order to draw &s;ome refre&s;hments from the &s;outh-ea&s;t part of the i&s;land, before we proceeded to Matavia, where we expected our principal &s;up|ply. We had a fre&s;h gale till two o'clock in the afternoon; when, at about a league from the bay the wind &s;uddenly died away. About two hours after, we had &s;udden &s;qualls, with rain, from the ea&s;t. About nine o'clock, we were obliged to &s;tand out, and &s;pend the night at &s;ea.</P>
<P>As we drew near the i&s;land, we were attended by &s;everal canoes, each conducted by two or three men. But, as they were of the lower cla&s;s, Omai &s;eemed to take no particular notice of them, nor they of him. They did not even know, that he was one of their countrymen, though they had for &s;ome time conver&s;ed with him. At length a chief, whom Captain Cook had known before,
<PB N="315" REF="030274_0374_0FE56E41B75A70D0">
named Ootee, and Omai's brother-in-law, who happened to be now at this corner of the i&s;land, and three or four others, all of whom knew Omai, before he embarked with Captain Furneaux, came on board. Yet there was nothing in the lea&s;t tender or &s;triking in their meeting, but, on the contrary, a perfect indifference on both &s;ides, till Omai, conducting his brother into the cabin, opened a drawer, and gave him a few red feathers. This circum&s;tance being &s;oon communicated to the re&s;t of the natives on deck, Ootee, who be|fore would hardly &s;peak to him, now begged, that they might be <HI>tayos</HI> (friends) and exchange names. Omai accepted of the honor, and a pre&s;ent of red feathers ratified the agreement; and Ootee, by way of recompence, &s;ent a&s;hore for a hog. It was evident, however, to all of us, that it was not the man, but his property, that they e&s;teemed. Had he not exhibited his trea&s;ure of red feathers, a commodity highly e&s;timated in the i&s;land, it is a matter of great doubt whether they would have be&s;towed a &s;ingle cocoa-nut upon him. Such was Omai's fir&s;t reception among his countrymen, and we never expected it would be otherwi&s;e; but we &s;uppo&s;ed, that the valuable cargo of pre&s;ents, with which he had been load|ed by the liberality of his frends in England, would be the certain means of rai&s;ing him into con&s;equence among the fir&s;t per&s;ons throughout the extent of the Society I&s;lands. This, indeed,
<PB N="316" REF="030274_0375_0FE56E3B699D2708">
mu&s;t have been the ca&s;e, had he conducted him|&s;elf with any degree of prudence; but he paid little or no attention to the repeated advice of his well-wi&s;hers, and laid him&s;elf open to every impo&s;ition.</P>
<P>We under&s;tood from the natives who came off to us, that &s;ince Captain Cook la&s;t vi&s;ited this i&s;land in 1774, two other &s;hips had twice been in Oheitepeha-bay, and had left animals there, like tho&s;e we had on board. But, on enquiry into the particulars, we found, that they con&s;i&s;ted only of hogs, dogs, goats, a bull, and the male of another animal, which they &s;o imperfectly de|&s;cribed, that we could not conjecture what it was. The&s;e &s;hips, they informed us, had come from a place called <HI>Re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ma;</HI> which we &s;uppo&s;ed to be Lima, the capital of Peru, and that the&s;e late vi&s;itors were con&s;equently Spaniards. They told us, that the fir&s;t time they arrived, they built a hou&s;e, and left behind them two prie&s;ts, a boy or &s;ervant, and a per&s;on called Mateema; taking away with them, when they &s;ailed, four of the natives; that about ten months afterwards, the &s;ame &s;hips returned, bringing back only two of the natives, the other two having died at Lima; and that, after a &s;hort &s;tay, they took away the people they had left; but that the hou&s;e which they erected was left &s;tanding.</P>
<P>News having been propagated on &s;hore, of red feathers being on board our &s;hips, we were early
<PB N="317" REF="030274_0376_0FE56E4C0F1AF950">
the next morning, &s;urrounded by a multitude of canoes, crowded with people, with plenty of hogs and fruits. A quantity of feathers, which might be taken from the body of a tom-tit, would, at that time, purcha&s;e a hog of forty or fifty pounds weight. But as the whole &s;hips crew were po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;ome of this precious article of trade, it decrea&s;ed above five hundred <HI>per cent.</HI> in its value in a few hours. However, the balance even then, was con&s;iderably in our favour, and red feathers &s;till pre&s;erved their &s;uperiority over every other commodity. Some of the i&s;landers would not di&s;po&s;e of a hog, without receiving an axe in exchange; but nai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s, and beads, and many other trinkets, which, during our former voyages, were held in high e&s;timation at this i&s;land, were now &s;o much di&s;pi&s;ed, that few would even deign to look at them.</P>
<P>Not having wind in the morning, it was nine o'clock before we could anchor in the bay, when we moored with the two bowers. We had not long anchored, before Omai's &s;i&s;ter came on board to congratulate him on his arrival. It was plea&s;|ing to ob&s;erve, that, to the honour of each of them, their meeting was marked with expre&s;&s;ions of the tendere&s;t affection more ea&s;ily conceived than de&s;cribed.</P>
<P>When this affecting &s;cene was clo&s;ed, and the &s;hip properly moored, Omai attended Captain Cook on &s;hore. The Captain's fir&s;t object was
<PB N="318" REF="030274_0377_0FE56E5BEB2FADE8">
to pay a vi&s;it to a man whom Omai repre&s;ented as a very extraordinary per&s;onage indeed, &s;aying he was the God of Bolabola. They &s;aw him &s;eated under one of tho&s;e awnings, which are u&s;u|ally carried in their larger canoes. He was old, and had &s;o far lo&s;t the u&s;e of his limbs, that he was carried from place to place upon a hand-bar|row. By &s;ome, he was called <HI>Olla</HI> or <HI>Orra,</HI> which is the name of the God of Bolabola; but his real name was Erary. From Omai's extra|ordinary account of his per&s;on, the Captain ex|pected to have &s;een religious adoration paid to him: but he &s;aw very little to di&s;tingui&s;h him from their other chiefs. Omai pre&s;ented to him a tuft of red feathers, fa&s;tened to the end of a &s;mall &s;tick; but after a little conver&s;ation with this Bolabola man, his attention was excited by the pre&s;ence of his mother's &s;i&s;ter, who was al|ready at his feet, and had bedewed them plenti|fully with tears of joy. The Captain left him with the old lady in this &s;ituation, &s;urrounded by a number of people, and went to take a &s;ur|vey of the hou&s;e &s;aid to have been erected by the &s;trangers who had lately landed here. He found it &s;till &s;tanding at a &s;mall di&s;tance from the beach. It was compo&s;ed of wooden materials, which appeared to have been brought hither, ready prepared, in order to &s;et up as occa&s;ion might require; for the planks were all number|ed. It con&s;i&s;ted of two &s;mall rooms, in the inner
<PB N="319" REF="030274_0378_0FE56E4F3646B2F8">
of which, were a bed&s;ted, a bench, a table, &s;ome old hats, and other trifles, of which the natives &s;eemed to be remarkably careful, as well as of the building it&s;elf, which had received no injury from the weather, a kind of &s;hed having been erected over it. Scuttles, &s;erving as air holes, appeared all round the building; and perhaps, they were al&s;o meant for the additional pur|po&s;e of firing from with mu&s;kets, if nece&s;&s;ity &s;hould require it. A wooden cro&s;s was placed at a little di&s;tance from the front, on the tran&s;|ver&s;e part of which appeared the following in|&s;cription:
<Q>Chri&s;tus vincit.</Q>
On the perpendicular part (which confirmed our conjecture that the two &s;hips were Spani&s;h) was engraved,
<Q>Carolus <HI>III.</HI> imperat, <HI>1774.</HI></Q>
And on the other &s;ide of the po&s;t, Captain Cook very properly pre&s;erved the memory of the prior vi&s;its of the Engli&s;h, by in&s;cribing,
<Q>Georgius tertius rex, Annis <HI>1767, 1769, 1773, 1774,</HI> et <HI>1777.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Near the foot of the cro&s;s the i&s;landers pointed out to us the grave of the Commodore of the two &s;hips, who died here, while they lay in the bay, on their fir&s;t arrival. His name, as near as we could gather from their pronunciation, was
<PB N="320" REF="030274_0379_0FE56E43C9FA7568">
Or<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ede. The Spaniards, whatever their intentions might be in vi&s;iting this i&s;land, &s;eemed to have taken infinite pains to have ingratiated them&s;elves with the natives; who, upon all occa&s;ions, men|tioned them with the &s;tronge&s;t terms of e&s;teem and veneration.</P>
<P>On this occa&s;ion, the Captain met with no chief of any con&s;iderable note excepting the aged per&s;onage above de&s;cribed. Waheiadooa, king of Tiaraboo, (as this part of the i&s;land is called by the natives) was now ab&s;ent; and we were afterwards informed, that (though his name was the &s;ame) he was not the &s;ame per&s;on as the chief whom Captain Cook had &s;een here in 1774; but his brother, a youth of ten years of age, who had &s;ucceeded the elder Waheiadooa. We al&s;o di&s;covered, that the celebrated Oberea was dead; but that Otoo, and all our other friends, were living.</P>
<P>When Captain Cook returned from the hou&s;e erected by the Spaniards, he found Omai harangu|ing a very large company; and could with diffi|culty di&s;engage him to accompany him aboard, where he had to &s;ettle a matter of importance.</P>
<P>Knowing that Otaheite, and the neighbouring i&s;lands, could &s;upply us plentifully with cocoa|nuts, the liquor of which is a mo&s;t excellent be|verage, he wi&s;hed to prevail upon his people to con&s;ent to be abridged, for a &s;hort time of their &s;tated allowance of &s;pirits to mix with water.</P>
<P><PB N="321" REF="030274_0380_0FE56E3CF081A9E0">But as this, without a&s;&s;igning &s;ome powerful rea|&s;on, might have occa&s;ioned a general murmur, he a&s;&s;embled the &s;hip's company, to communi|cate to them the entent of the voyage, and the extent of our future operations. He took notice of the generous rewards offered, by parliament, to &s;uch as &s;hall fir&s;t di&s;cover a communication between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans in the Northern Hemi&s;phere, as well as to tho&s;e who &s;hall fir&s;t penetrate beyond the 89th degree of northern latitude. He &s;aid, that he did not en|tertain a doubt, that he &s;hould find them ready to co-opperate with him in attempting to obtain one, or both the&s;e rewards; but that it would be nece&s;&s;ary to be &s;trickly oeconomical in the ex|penditure of our &s;tores and provi&s;ions, as we had not a chance of getting a &s;upply after leaving the&s;e i&s;lands. He further ob&s;erved, that the du|ration of our voyage would exceed by a year, at lea&s;t, what had been originally &s;uppo&s;ed, by our having lo&s;t the opportunity of getting to the north this &s;ummer. He begged them to con&s;i|der the various ob&s;tructions, and aggravated hard|&s;hips, they mu&s;t yet labour under, if they &s;hould be under the nece&s;&s;ity of being put to &s;hort al|lowance, of any &s;pecies of provi&s;ions, in a cold climate. He therefore &s;ubmitted to them, whe|ther it would not be the mo&s;t advi&s;eable to be prudent in time, and rather than run the ri&s;k of having their &s;pirits exhau&s;ted, when they might
<PB N="322" REF="030274_0381_0FE56E5D947E9CD0">
be mo&s;t wanted, to con&s;ent to be without their grog at pre&s;ent, when we could &s;upply its place with &s;o excellent, a liquor as that of cocoa-nuts. He added neverthele&s;s, that he would leave the determination entirely to their own choice.</P>
<P>This propo&s;al did not remain a moment under con&s;ideration, and Captain Cook had the &s;atis|faction to find that it was unanimou&s;ly approved of. He ordered Captain Clerke to make a &s;imi|lar propo&s;al to his his people; which they al&s;o rea|dily agreed to. The &s;erving of grog was there|fore immediately &s;topped, except on Saturday nights, when all the men had a full allowance of it, to enable them to drink the healths of their female friends in England; le&s;t, amid&s;t the pretty girls of Otaheite, they &s;hould be totally forgotten.</P>
<P>We began, the next day, &s;ome nece&s;&s;ary ope|rations; &s;uch as in&s;pecting the provi&s;ions in the main and fore-hold, getting the ca&s;ks of beef and pork, &amp;c. out of the ground tier, and putting a quantity of balla&s;t in their place- The &s;hip was ordered to be caulked, which &s;he &s;tood in much need of; having, at times, made a con&s;iderable deal of water on our pa&s;&s;age from the Friendly I&s;lands. Captain Cook al&s;o put his cattle on &s;hore, and appointed two of his men to look after them while grazing; not intending to leave any of them on this part of the i&s;land.</P>
<P>It rained almo&s;t ince&s;&s;antly, the two following days; notwith&s;tanding which, we were vi&s;ited by
<PB N="323" REF="030274_0382_0FE56E5F3174A118">
the natives from every quarter, the news of our arrival having mo&s;t rapidly &s;pread. Waheiadooa, though at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance, had been in|formed of it; and in the afternoon of the 16th, a chief, named Etorea, who was his tutor, brought Captain Cook two hogs as a pre&s;ent from him; acquainting him, at the &s;ame time, that he him|&s;elf would attend him the day after. He was punctual to his promi&s;e; for the Captain receiv|ed a me&s;&s;age from him early the next morning, notifying his arrival, and reque&s;ting he would go a&s;hore to meet him. In con&s;equence of this in|vitation, Omai and he prepared to make him a formal vi&s;it. Omai, on this occa&s;ion, took &s;ome pains to dre&s;s him&s;elf, not after the manner of the Engli&s;h, nor that of Otaheite, or Tongata|boo, or in the dre&s;s of any other country upon earth; but in a &s;trange medly of all the habili|ments and ornaments he was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of.</P>
<P>Thus equipped, they got a&s;hore, and fir&s;t paid a vi&s;it to Etary; who, carried on a hand-barrow, accompanied them to a large building, where he was &s;et down; Omai &s;eated him&s;elf on one &s;ide of him, and Captain Cook on the other. The Captain cau&s;ed a piece of Tongataboo cloth to be &s;pread, on which were placed the pre&s;ents he intended to make. The young Chief &s;oon after arrived, attended by his mother, and &s;everal prin|cipal men, who all &s;eated them&s;elves oppo&s;ite to us. A man who &s;at near, the Captain made a
<PB N="324" REF="030274_0383_0FE56E671E6C4CB0">
&s;hort &s;peech con&s;i&s;ting of &s;eparate &s;entences; parts of which was dictated by tho&s;e about him. Another, on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide, near the chief, &s;poke next; Etary after him, and then Omai, &amp;c. The &s;ubjects of the&s;e orations were Captain Cook's arrival, and his connexions with them. Among&s;t other things, one of them told the Captain, that the men of <HI>Reema</HI> (the Spaniards) de&s;ired they would not &s;uffer him to come into Oheitepeha Bay, if he &s;hould return again to the i&s;land, for that it was their property; but that, &s;o far from re|garding this reque&s;t, he was authorized now to &s;urrender to him the province of Tiaraboo, and every thing that was in it. It was evident from this, that the&s;e people are no &s;trangers to the po|licy of accommodating them&s;elves to pre&s;ent cir|cum&s;tances. The young chief, at length, was directed, by his attendants, to embrace Captain Cook; and, as a confirmation of this treaty of friend&s;hip, they exchanged names. After the&s;e ceremonies were over, he and his friends accom|panied the Captain, to dine with him on board.</P>
<P>Omai had prepared, as a pre&s;ent for Otoo, the king of the whole i&s;land, a <HI>maro,</HI> compo&s;ed of red and yellow feathers; and, con&s;idering where we were, it was a pre&s;ent of great value. Cap|tain Cook endeavoured to prevail on him not to produce it now, wi&s;hing him to keep it till he had an opportunity of pre&s;enting it to Otoo with his own hands. But he entertained too good an
<PB N="325" REF="030274_0384_0FE56E6919380A18">
opinion of the fidelity of his countrymen, to be guided by his advice. He was determined to carry it a&s;hore, on this occa&s;ion, and to give it to Waheiadooa, to be forwarded by him to Otoo, and added to the royal <HI>maro.</HI> By this ma|nagement, he &s;uppo&s;ed he &s;hould oblige both chiefs; on the contrary, he highly di&s;obliged that who&s;e favour was of the mo&s;t con&s;equence to him, without obtaining any reward from the other. The Captain was prophetic upon this oc|ca&s;ion; for Waheiadooa, as he expected, kept the <HI>maro</HI> for him&s;elf, and only &s;ent to Otoo about a twentieth part of what compo&s;ed the magnifi|cent pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>On the 19th, Captain Cook received, from the young chief, a pre&s;ent of ten or a dozen hogs &s;ome cloath, and a quantity of fruit. In the even|ing, we exhibited &s;ome fire works, which both plea&s;ed and a&s;toni&s;hed the numerous &s;pectators.</P>
<P>Some of our gentlemen, in their walks, di&s;cover|ed, as they thought, a Roman Catholic chapel. They de&s;cribed the alter which they &s;aid they had &s;een, and every other con&s;tituent part of &s;uch a place of wor&s;hip. They mentioned, however, at the &s;ame time, that two per&s;ons, who had the care of it, would not permit them to go in; on which ac|count the Captain imagined they were mi&s;taken, and had the curio&s;ity to pay a vi&s;it to it him&s;elf. The &s;uppo&s;ed chapel happened to be a <HI>toopapaoo,</HI> in which the body of the late Waheiadooa lay, in
<PB N="326" REF="030274_0385_0FE56E6AA09BA418">
a kind of &s;tate. It was in a pretty large hou&s;e, enclo&s;ed with a low pali&s;ade. The <HI>toopapaoo</HI> was remarkably neat, and re&s;embled one of tho&s;e little awnings over their large canoes. It was hung and covered with cloaths and mats of a va|riety of colours, which had a beautiful effect. One piece of &s;carlet broad cloth of the length of four or five yards, appeared con&s;picuous among the other ornaments; which had probably been received as a pre&s;ent from the Spaniards. This cloth, and &s;ome ta&s;&s;els of feathers, &s;ugge&s;ted to our gentlemen the idea of a chapel; and their imagination &s;upplied what ever el&s;e was wanting to create a re&s;emblance: hearing that the Spa|niards had vi&s;ited this place, might al&s;o operate on their minds upon this occa&s;ion, and add to the probability of its being a chapel. Small of|ferings of fruits and roots &s;eemed to be daily made at this &s;hrine, &s;ome pieces being now quite fre&s;h. The&s;e were depo&s;ited on a kind of alter which &s;tood without the pali&s;ades; within which we were not permitted to enter. Two men con|&s;tantly attended here, both night and day; as well to watch over the place, as to dre&s;s and un|dre&s;s the <HI>toopapaoo.</HI> When Captain Cook went to &s;urvey it, the cloth and its appendages were rolled up; but at his reque&s;t, the two attendants placed it in order, but not till after they had dre&s;&s;ed them&s;elves, in clean white robes. The
<PB N="327" REF="030274_0386_0FE56E2FA67A76C0">
chief we were informed, had been dead about twenty months.</P>
<P>Having provided a fre&s;h &s;upply of water, and fini&s;hed all our nece&s;&s;ary operations, on the 22d we brought off our animals from &s;hore, and made ready for &s;ea. While the &s;hips were unmooring, Omai and Captain Cook landed, in the morning of the 23d, to take leave of the young chief. While they were with him, one of tho&s;e per&s;ons, whom they called <HI>Eatooas,</HI> from a per&s;ua&s;ion that they po&s;&s;e&s;s the &s;pirit of the divinity, pre&s;ented him&s;elf before them. He had all the appearances of in&s;anity about him, and his only covering was a quantity of planting leaves wrapped round his wai&s;t. He uttered what he had to &s;ay in a low, &s;queaking voice, &s;o as hardly to be under&s;tood. But Omai &s;aid he perfectly comprehended him, and that he was advi&s;ing Waheiadooa not to accom|pany Captain Cook to Matavia, an expedition which he had never known that he intended, nor had the Captain ever made &s;uch a propo&s;al to him. The <HI>Eatooa</HI> al&s;o predicted, that the &s;hips would not arrive that day at Matavai. In this, however, he was mi&s;taken; though appearances, at that time, favoured his a&s;&s;ertion, as there was not a &s;ingle breath of wind in any direction. While he was delivering his prophecy, a heavy &s;hower of rain came on, which occa&s;ioned all to run for &s;helter, except him&s;elf, who appeared to di&s;regard it. He continued &s;queaking about half
<PB N="328" REF="030274_0387_0FE56E6C27B2C7E0">
an hour, and then retired. No attention was paid to what he uttered, though &s;ome of the na|tives laughed at him.</P>
<P>Captain Cook a&s;ked the chief, whether he was an <HI>Earee</HI> or a <HI>Towtow?</HI> The an&s;wer he received was, that he was <HI>toata eno,</HI> that is, a bad man. And yet, notwith&s;tanding this, and the little no|tice taken of the mad prophet, &s;uper&s;tition &s;o far governs the natives, that they ab&s;olutely believe &s;uch per&s;ons to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with the &s;pirit of the <HI>Eatooa.</HI> Omai &s;eemed to be well in&s;tructed con|cerning them. He &s;aid, that during the fits, with which they are &s;eized, they know nobody, and that if any one of them is a man of pro|perty, he will then give away every moveable he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, if his friends do not put them out of his reach; and when he recovers, he &s;eems not to have the lea&s;t remembrance of what he had done during the time the fit was upon him.</P>
<P>Soon after the Captain got on board, a light breeze &s;pringing up at ea&s;t, we got under &s;ail, and the Re&s;olution anchored, the &s;ame evening at Matavai Bay; but the Di&s;covery did not get in till the next morning; con&s;equently the man's prophecy was half fulfilled.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>ON Sunday the 24th, in the morning, Otoo, the king of the whole i&s;land, accompanied by a great number of the natives in their canoes, came from Oparre, his place of re&s;idence, and having landed on Matai Point, &s;ent a me&s;&s;enger on board, intimating his de&s;ire to &s;ee Captain Cook there. He accordingly went a &s;hore, at|tended by Omai, and &s;ome of the officers. They found a va&s;t multitude of people a&s;&s;embled on this occa&s;ion, in the mid&s;t of whom was the king, with his father, his two brothers, and three &s;i&s;ters. The Captain went towards him and &s;aluted him, being followed by Omai, who kneeled and em|braced his legs. Though Omai had prepared him&s;elf for this ceremony, by dre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf in
<PB N="330" REF="030274_0389_0FE56E72C5B15238">
his be&s;t apparel, and behaved with great re&s;pect and mode&s;ty, yet very little notice was taken of him. He made the king a pre&s;ent of two or three yards of gold cloth, and a large piece of red feathers, and the Captain gave him a gold-laced hat, a &s;uit of fine linen, &s;ome tools, a quantity of read feathers, and one of the bonnets worn at the Friendly i&s;lands.</P>
<P>This vi&s;it being over, the king, and all the royal family, accompanied Captain Cook on board, followed by &s;everal canoes, plentifully laden with all kind of provi&s;ions. Each of the family owned a part; &s;o that the Captain had a pre&s;ent from every one of them; and each received from him a &s;eparate pre&s;ent in return. Not long after, the king's mother came on board, bringing with her &s;ome provi&s;ions and cloth, which &s;he divided be|tween the Commodore and Omai. Though the latter was but little noticed at fir&s;t by his country|men, they no &s;ooner gained information of his wealth, than they began to court his friend&s;hip. Captain Cook encouraged them as far as lay in his power, being de&s;irous of fixing him with Otoo. intending to leave all his European animals at this i&s;land, he thought Omai would be able to give the natives &s;ome in&s;truction with regard to their u&s;e, and the management of them. Be&s;ides, the Captain was convinced, that the farther he was removed from his native i&s;land, the more he would be re&s;pected. But unfortunately, Omai rejected
<PB N="331" REF="030274_0390_0FE56E45516B9070">
his advice, and behaved in &s;o imprudent a man|ner, that he &s;oon lo&s;t the friend&s;hip of Otoo, and of all the mo&s;t con&s;iderable per&s;ons at Otaheite. He a&s;&s;ociated with none but &s;trangers and vaga|bonds, who&s;e &s;ole intention was to plunder him: and, if the Captain had not interfered, they would not have left him a &s;ingle article of any con&s;e|quence. This conduct drew upon him the ill-will of the principal chiefs; who found that they could not obtain, from any one in either &s;hip, &s;uch valuable pre&s;ents as were be&s;towed by Omai on the lowe&s;t of the people. After dinner, a party of us accompanied Otoo to Oparre, taking with us &s;ome poultry, con&s;i&s;ting of a peacock and hen, a turky-cock and hen, three gee&s;e, one gander, four ducks, and a drake. All the&s;e we left at Oparre, in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Otoo: and the&s;e gee&s;e and ducks began to breed before we &s;ailed. We found there a gander, that Captain Wallis had given to Oberea ten years before; we al&s;o met with &s;everal goats, and the Spani&s;h bull, whom they kept tied to a tree, near the habitation of Otoo. We never beheld a finer animal of his kind. He now belonged to Etary, and had been conveyed from Oheitepeha to this place, in order to be &s;hipped for Bolabola. The next day the Commodore &s;ent to this bull the three cows that he had on board; and the bull, which he had brought, the hor&s;e, and mare, and &s;heep, were now put a&s;hore at Matavai. Having thus di&s;|po&s;ed
<PB N="332" REF="030274_0391_0FE56E7490F3B0F0">
of the&s;e animals, he found him&s;elf ea&s;ed of the extraordinary trouble and vexation that had attended the bringing this living cargo to &s;uch a di&s;tance.</P>
<P>As Captain Cook intended to continue here a con&s;iderable time, we &s;et up our ob&s;ervatories on Matavai Point; and, adjoined to them, two tents were pitched, for the reception of a guard, and of &s;uch people as might be left on &s;hore, in different departments. The command, at this &s;tation, was entru&s;ted to Mr. King; who al&s;o at|tended the a&s;tronomical and other ob&s;ervations. While we remained here, the crews of both &s;hips were occupied in many nece&s;&s;ary operations. The Di&s;covery's main-ma&s;t was carried a&s;hore, and made as good as it had ever been before. Our &s;ails and water-ca&s;ks were repaired; both of our &s;hips were caulked; and the rigging was com|pleatly over-hauled. We likewi&s;e in&s;pected the bread that we had on board in ca&s;ks, and found that but little of it was damaged.</P>
<P>On the 26th, a piece of ground was cleared for a garden, and planted with &s;everal articles; very few of which will, probably, be looked after by the natives. Some potatoes, melons, and pine-apple plants, were in a fair way of &s;ucceeding be|fore we quitted the place. We had brought, from the Friendly I&s;lands, &s;everal &s;haddock-trees, which we al&s;o planted here; and they will in all probability &s;ucceed, unle&s;s their growth &s;hould
<PB N="333" REF="030274_0392_0FE56E7618EC2850">
be checked by the &s;ame idle and premature curio|&s;ity which de&s;troyed a vine planted at Oheitepeha by the Spaniards. Many of the natives a&s;&s;embled to ta&s;te the fir&s;t fruit it produced; but the grapes being &s;till &s;our, they con&s;idered it as a little better than poi&s;on, and trod it under foot. In that &s;tate Omai accidentally found it, and was rejoiced at the di&s;covery; for he was confident, that if he had but grapes, he could ea&s;ily make wine. Ac|cordingly, he had &s;everal &s;lips cut off from the tree, with an intention of carrying them away with him; and he pruned, and put in order, the remains of it.</P>
<P>Before we had been two days at anchor in Ma|tavai Bay, we were vi&s;ited by all our old friends, who&s;e names are mentioned in the narrative of Captain Cook's la&s;t voyage. Not one of them came with empty hands; &s;o that we had an amaz|ing quantity of provi&s;ions, without any appre|hen&s;ions of exhau&s;ting the i&s;land, which pre&s;ented to our eyes every mark of the mo&s;t exuberant fer|tility and abundance. Soon after we had arrived here, one of the i&s;landers, whom the Spaniards had carried with them to Lima, paid us a vi&s;it; but, in his exterior appearance, he was not di&s;tin|gui&s;hable from the re&s;t of his countrymen. He &s;till remembered &s;ome Spani&s;h words, among which the mo&s;t frequent were, <HI>&s;i Sennor.</HI> He al&s;o found here the young man whom we called Oedidee, but who&s;e real name is Heete-heete.
<PB N="334" REF="030274_0393_0FE56E77E38D5D38">
Captain Cook had carried him from Ulieta on board his &s;hip in 1773, and brought him back in the &s;ucceeding year, after he had vi&s;ited the Friendly I&s;lands, New-Zealand, Ea&s;ter I&s;land, and the Marque&s;as. He had come from Bolabola (of which he was a native) to Otaheite, about three months before probably with the &s;ole view of gratifying hid <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">rio&s;ity. He preferred the modes, and even dre&s;s, of his countrymen to ours; for, though Captain Cook gave him &s;ome cloths, which our board of admiralty had thought proper to &s;end for his u&s;e (to which he added a che&s;t of tools, and &s;everal other articles, as a pre&s;ent for him&s;elf) he, after a few days, de|clined wearing them. This in&s;tance, as well as that of the per&s;on who had been at Lima, may be adduced as a proof of the &s;trong inclination of mankind in general to habits acquired at an early age; and it is perhaps no unrea&s;onable &s;uppo|&s;ition, that even Omai, who had imbibed almo&s;t the whole Engli&s;h manners, will in a &s;hort time after being left by us, return, like Oedidee, and the vi&s;itor of Lima, to his own native garments, and his original mode of life.</P>
<P>In the morning of the 27th, a man from Ohei|tepeha informed us, that two Spani&s;h &s;hips had achored in that bay the preceeding night; and to confirm this intelligence, he produced &s;ome coar&s;e blue cloth, which, he &s;aid, he had got out of one of the &s;hips. He further &s;aid, that Mateema was
<PB N="335" REF="030274_0394_0FE56E7C37F735A0">
in one of the &s;hips; and that they would come to Matavai in two or three days. The&s;e and &s;ome other circum&s;tances, which he mentioned, gave the &s;tory &s;o much the apperance of truth, that the Commodore di&s;patched Lieutenant William|&s;on in a boat, to look into Oheitepeha Bay; and, in the mean time, both our &s;hips were put in a po&s;ture of defence. For, though England and Spain were at peace when he left England, he did not know but that a different &s;cene might, by this time, have opened. Upon enquiry, how|ever, we had rea&s;on to imagine, that the relater of the &s;tory had impo&s;ed upon us; and this was put beyond all doubt, when Mr. William&s;on re|turned the day following, who made his report to Captain Cook, that he had been at Oheitepeha, and found that no &s;hips were there at pre&s;ent, nor had any been there &s;ince we left it. The people of this part of the i&s;land, were we now were &s;ta|tioned, told us indeed, at fir&s;t, that it was a fiction invented by tho&s;e of Tiaraboo. But what view they could have, we could not conceive, unle&s;s they &s;uppo&s;ed that the report would induce us to quit the i&s;land, and thus deprive the inha|bitants of Otaheite-nooe of the advantages they might otherwi&s;e reap from our &s;hips remaining there; the natives of the two parts of the i&s;land being inveterate enemies to each other.</P>
<P>Since we arrived at Matavai, the weather had been very un&s;ettled till the 29th; before which
<PB N="336" REF="030274_0395_0FE56E7E32E023B0">
day we were unable to get even altitudes of the &s;un for a&s;certaining the going of the time-keeper. The caulking, and other repairs of the &s;hips, were al&s;o retarded by the &s;ame cau&s;e. In the evening of this day, the i&s;landers made a precipitate re|treat, both from our land &s;tation, and from on board the &s;hips. We conjectured that this aro&s;e from their knowing that &s;ome theft had been com|mitted, and apprehending puni&s;hment upon that account. At length, we became acquainted with the whole affair: one of the &s;urgeon's mates had made an excur&s;ion into the country to purcha&s;e curio&s;ities, and had taken with him four hatchets for the purpo&s;e of exchange. Having been &s;o imprudent as to employ a native to carry them, the fellow took an opportunity of running off with &s;o valuable a prize. This was the rea&s;on of the &s;udden flight, in which Otoo him&s;elf, and all his family had joined; and it was with difficulty that the Captain &s;topped them, after following them for the &s;pace of two or three miles. As he had determined to take no mea&s;ures for the recovery of the hatchets, that his people for the future might be more upon their guard again&s;t &s;uch neg|ligence, every thing quickly re&s;umed its former tranquillity.</P>
<P>The next morning &s;ome me&s;&s;engers arrived from Eimeo, with intelligence, that the people of that i&s;land were in arms: and that Otoo's par|tizans there had been obliged by the oppo&s;ite
<PB N="337" REF="030274_0396_0FE56E7FC5188120">
party to retreat to the mountains. The quarrel between the two i&s;lands, which began in 1774, had partly &s;ub&s;i&s;ted every &s;ince. A formidable armament had &s;ailed &s;oon after Captain Cook left Otaheite in his la&s;t voyage; but the malecontents of Eimeo had made &s;o gallant a re&s;i&s;tance, that the fleet had returned without &s;ucce&s;s; and now another expedition was deemed nece&s;&s;ary. On the arrival of the&s;e me&s;&s;engers, the chiefs a&s;&s;em|bled at Otoo's hou&s;e, where the Captain actually was at that time, and had the honour of being admitted into their council. One of the me&s;&s;en|gers opened the bu&s;ine&s;s with a &s;peech of con&s;ider|able length, the purport of which was to explain the &s;ituation of affairs in Eimeo, and to excite the Otaheitean chiefs to arm on the occa&s;ion. This opinion was oppo&s;ed by others who were again&s;t commencing ho&s;tilities; and the debate was, for &s;ome time, carried on with great order and deco|rum. At length, however, they became very tumultuous, and the Captain began to expect that their meeting would conclude like a Poli&s;h diet. But the contending chiefs cooled as fa&s;t as they grew warm, and order was &s;peedily re&s;tored. In the end, the party for war prevailed; and it was re&s;olved, though not unanimou&s;ly, that a &s;trong force &s;hould be &s;ent to Eimeo. Otoo &s;aid very little during the whole debate. Tho&s;e of the council, who were inclinable for war, applied to the Captain for his a&s;&s;i&s;tance; and all of them
<PB N="338" REF="030274_0397_0FE56E814D0E3D48">
were de&s;irous of knowing what part he would take, Omai was &s;ent for to act as his interpreter; but, as he could not be found, the Captain, being under a nece&s;&s;ity of &s;peaking for him&s;elf, told them, as well as he could, that, as he was not perfectly acquainted with the di&s;pute, and as the natives of Eimeo had never given him the lea&s;t cau&s;e of offence, he could not think of engaging in ho&s;tilities again&s;t them. With this declaration they either were, or appeared to be, &s;atisfied. The council was then di&s;&s;olved; but, before the Captain retired, Otoo de&s;ired him to come again in the afternoon, and bring Omai with him.</P>
<P>A party of us accordingly waited upon him at the appointed time; and he conducted us to his father, in who&s;e pre&s;ence the di&s;pute with Eimeo was again di&s;cu&s;&s;ed. The Commodore being very de&s;irous of effecting an accommodation, &s;ounded the old chief on that &s;ubject; but he was deaf to any &s;uch propo&s;al, and fully determined to carry on ho&s;tilities. On our enquiry into the cau&s;e of the war, we were informed, that, &s;everal years ago, a brother of Waheiadooa, of Tiaraboo, was &s;ent to Eimeo, at the de&s;ire of Maheine, a popu|lar chief of that i&s;land, to be their king; but had not been there many days before Maheine, having cau&s;ed him to be put to death, &s;et up for him&s;elf, in oppo&s;ition to Tierataboonooe, newphew of the decea&s;ed, who now became the lawful heir, or perhaps had been appointed, by the people of
<PB N="339" REF="030274_0398_0FE56E87876DEAA0">
Otaheite, to &s;ucceed to the government on the death of the other.</P>
<P>Towha, who is related to Otoo, and chief of the di&s;trict of Tettaha, and who had been com|mander in chief of the armament &s;ent again&s;t Eimeo in 1774, happened not to be at Matavai at this time, and, therefore, was not pre&s;ent at the&s;e con&s;ultations. It appeared, however, that he was no &s;tranger to what was tran&s;acted; and that he entered into the affair with great eagerne&s;s and &s;pirit. For, on the 1&s;t of September, a me&s;|&s;enger arrived from him to acquaint Otoo, that he had killed a man to be &s;acrificed to the <HI>Fatooa,</HI> with the view of imploring the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the deity again&s;t Eimeo. This ceremony was to be performed at the great <HI>morai,</HI> at Attahooroo; and Otoo's pre&s;ence was nece&s;&s;ary on the occa&s;ion. Captain Cook was de&s;irous of being pre&s;ent at this &s;olemnity, and therefore propo&s;ed to Otoo, that he might be permitted to accompany him. To this the king readily con&s;ented; and they imme|diately &s;et out in the Captain's boat, with his old friend Potatou, Mr. Ander&s;on, and Mr. Webber, while Omai followed them in a canoe. In their way they landed upon a &s;mall i&s;land, lying off Tettaha, where they found Towha and his atten|dants. After a little conver&s;ation between the two chiefs, on the &s;ubject of the war, Towha ad|dre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to the Captain, &s;oliciting his a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance. When he exclu&s;ed him&s;elf, Towha &s;eemed
<PB N="340" REF="030274_0399_0FE56E890D63DF28">
di&s;plea&s;ed; thinking it rather extraordinary, that one who had con&s;tantly declared him&s;elf the friend of their i&s;land, &s;hould now refu&s;e to fight again&s;t its enemies. Before they parted, Towha gave to Otoo two or three red feathers, tied up in a tuft; our party then re-embarked, having taken on board a prie&s;t, who was to a&s;&s;i&s;t at the &s;olemnity.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as they landed at Attahooroo, which was about two o'clock, Otoo de&s;ired that the &s;ailors might be ordered to continue in the boat; and that Captain Cook, Mr. Ander&s;on, and Mr. Webber, would take off their hats as &s;oon as they &s;hould come to the <HI>morai,</HI> to which they imme|diately proceeded, attended by numbers of men, and &s;ome boys; but not one woman was pre&s;ent. They found four prie&s;ts, with their a&s;&s;i&s;tants, waiting for them. The dead body, or &s;acrifice, was in a &s;mall canoe that lay on the beach, front|ing the <HI>morai.</HI> Two of the prie&s;ts with &s;everal of their attendants, were &s;itting by the canoe; the others at the <HI>morai.</HI> Our company &s;topped at the di&s;tance of twenty or thirty paces from the prie&s;ts. Here Otoo placed him&s;elf; our gen|tlemen, and a few others, &s;tanding by him, while the majority of the people were removed at a greater di&s;tance.</P>
<P>The ceremonies now commenced. One of the attendants of the prie&s;ts brought a young plan|tain-tree, and laid it down before the king. Ano|ther approached, bearing a &s;mall tuft of red fea|thers,
<PB N="341" REF="030274_0400_0FE56E8A92E29070">
twi&s;ted on &s;ome fibres of the cocoa-nut hu&s;k, with which he touched one of Otoo's feet, and afterwards retired with it to his companions. One of the prie&s;ts who were &s;eated at the <HI>morai,</HI> now began a long prayer; and, at particular times, &s;ent down young plantain-trees, which were placed upon the &s;acrifice. During this prayer, an i&s;lander, who &s;tood by the officiating prie&s;t, held in his hands two bundles, in one of which, as we aftewards found, was the royal <HI>maro;</HI> and the other, if we may be allowed the expre&s;&s;ion, was the ark of the <HI>Eatooa.</HI> The prayer being fini&s;hed, the prie&s;ts at the <HI>morai,</HI> with their a&s;&s;i&s;tants, went and &s;at down by tho&s;e who were upon the beach, carrying the two bun|dles with them. They here renewed their prayers&punc; during which the plantain-trees were taken, one by one, at various times, from off the dead body, which, being wrapped up in cocoa-leaves and &s;mall branches, was now taken out of the canoe, and laid upon the beach. The prie&s;ts placed them&s;elves around it; &s;ome &s;tanding, and others &s;itting; and one, or more of them, repeated &s;entences for about ten minutes. The body was now &s;tripped of the leaves and branches, and placed parallel with the &s;ea-&s;hore. Then one of the prie&s;ts, &s;tanding at the feet of the corp&s;e, pronounced a long prayer, in which he was occa&s;ionally joined by the others, each of them holding a tuft of red feathers in his hand. During this prayer, &s;ome hair was pulled

off the head of the intended &s;acrifice, and the left eye was taken out; both which being wrapped up in a green-leaf, were pre&s;ented to the king; who, however did not touch them, but gave, to the man who pre&s;ented them the tuft of red feathers which he had received from Towha. This, with the eye and hair, was taken to the prie&s;ts. Not long after, his maje&s;ty &s;ent them another piece of feathers. In the cour&s;e of this la&s;t ceremony, a king-fi&s;her making a noi&s;e in the trees, Otoo turned to Captain Cook, &s;aying, "That is the <HI>Eatooa</HI>;" and &s;eemed to con&s;ider it as a favour|able progno&s;tic.</P>
<P>The corp&s;e was then carried a littie way, and laid under a tree; near which were fixed three thin pieces of wood, variou&s;ly carved. The bun|dles of cloth were placed on a part of the <HI>morai;</HI> and the tufts of red feathers were laid at the feet of the dead body, round which the prie&s;ts &s;tationed them&s;elves; and our gentlemen were now per|mitted to go as near as they plea&s;ed. He who &s;eemed to be the chief prie&s;t &s;poke for about a quarter of an hour, with different tones and ge&s;|tures; &s;ometimes appearing to expo&s;tulate with the decea&s;ed; at other times, a&s;king &s;everal que&s;|tions; then making various demands, as if the dead per&s;on either had power him&s;elf, or intere&s;t with the deity, to engage him to grant &s;uch re|que&s;ts; among which he de&s;ired him to deliever Eimeo, Maheine its chief, the women, hogs, and
<PB N="343" REF="030274_0402_0FE56E917A73E9B8">
other things of the i&s;land, into their hands; which was, indeed, the expre&s;s object of the &s;a|crifice. He then prayed near half an hour, in a whining tone, and two other prie&s;ts joined in the prayer, in the cour&s;e of which a prie&s;t plucked &s;ome more hair from the head of the corp&s;e, and put it upon one of the bundles: The chief prie&s;t now prayed alone, holding in his hand the fea|thers received from Towha. Having fini&s;hed, he gave them to another prie&s;t, who prayed in like manner; then all the tufts of feathers were placed upon the bundles of the cloth, which concluded the ceremony at this place.</P>
<P>The dead body was now carried to the mo&s;t con&s;picuous part of the <HI>morai,</HI> with the feathers and the two bundles of cloth, while the drums beat &s;lowly. The feathers and bundles were laid again&s;t the pile of &s;tones, and the body at the foot of them. The prie&s;ts having again &s;eated them&s;elves round the corp&s;e, renewed their pray|ers, while &s;ome of their a&s;&s;i&s;tants dug a hole about the depth of two feet, into which they threw the victim, and covered it over with &s;tones and earth. While they were committing the body to the grave, a boy &s;queaked aloud, upon which Omai &s;aid to Captain Cook, that it was the <HI>Eatooa.</HI> A fire having been made in the mean time, a lean half-&s;tarved dog was produced and killed by twi&s;ting his neck. The hair was then &s;inged off, and the entrails being taken out,
<PB N="344" REF="030274_0403_0FE56E9359E224F8">
were thrown into the fire, where they were left to be con&s;umed; but the kidney, heart, and liver, were only roa&s;ted, by being put on heated &s;tones; and the carca&s;e of the dog, after being rubbed over with the blood, was, with the liver, &amp;c. laid down before the prie&s;ts, who were &s;eat|ed round the grave praying. They for &s;ome time uttered ejaculations over the dog, while two men, at intervals, beat very loud on two drums; and a boy &s;creamed, in a loud &s;hrill voice, three times. This, they &s;aid, was to invite the <HI>Eatooa</HI> to fea&s;t on the banquet that they had provided for him. When the prie&s;ts had fini&s;hed their prayers, the body, heart, liver, &amp;c. of the dog, were placed on a <HI>whatta,</HI> or &s;caffold, about &s;ix feet in height, on which lay the remans of two other dogs, and of two pigs, which had been lately &s;acrificed. The prie&s;ts and attendants now gave a kind of &s;hout, which put an end to the ceremonies for the pre&s;ent. The evening being arrived, our gentlemen were conducted to a hou&s;e belonging to Potatou, where they were entertained and lodged for the night. Having been informed, that the religious rites were to be renewed the next morning, they would not quit the place while any thing remained to be &s;een. Some of them repaired to the &s;cene of action early in the morning; and, &s;oon afterwards, a pig was &s;acri|ficed, and laid upon the &s;ame &s;caffold with the others. About eight o'clock, Otoo took our
<PB N="345" REF="030274_0404_0FE56E94E0AF3000">
party again to the <HI>morai,</HI> where the prie&s;ts, and a great multitude of people, where by this time a&s;&s;embled. The two bundles occupied the place where they had been depo&s;ited the preceding evening; the two drums were in the front of the <HI>morai,</HI> and the prie&s;ts were &s;tationed beyond them. The king placed him&s;elf between the drums, and de&s;ired Captain Cook to &s;tand by him.</P>
<P>The ceremony of this day began with bringing a young plantain-tree, and laying it at his ma|je&s;ty's feet. A prayer was then repeated by the prie&s;ts, holding in their hands &s;everal tufts of red feathers, and al&s;o a plume of o&s;trich feathers, which the Commodore had pre&s;ented to Otoo on his fir&s;t arrival. When the prie&s;ts had ended the prayer, they changed their &s;tation, and placed them&s;elves between our gentlemen and the <HI>morai.</HI> One of them, the &s;ame who had performed the principal part the preceding day, began another prayer, which continued near half an hour. During this prayer, the tufts of red feathers were put, one by one, upon the ark of the <HI>Eatooa.</HI> Not long after, four pigs were produced, one of which was immediately killed, and the three others were taken to a neighbouring &s;ty.</P>
<P>One of the bundles was now untied; and it was found to contain the <HI>maro,</HI> with which the Ota|heiteans inve&s;t their kings. When taken out of the cloth, it was &s;pread on the ground, at full length, before the prie&s;ts. It is a girdle about
<PB N="346" REF="030274_0405_0FE56E9669242E48">
fifteen feet in length, and one foot and a quarter in breadth, and is probably put on in the &s;ame manner as the common <HI>maro,</HI> or piece of cloth, u&s;ed by the&s;e i&s;landers to wrap round the wai&s;t. It was ornamented with yellow and red feathers; but principally with the former. One end of it was bordered with eight pieces, about the &s;ize and figure of a hor&s;e-&s;hoe, who&s;e edges were fringed with black feathers. The other end was forked, having the points of various lengths. The feathers were ranged in two rows, in &s;quare compartments, and produced a plea&s;ing effect. They had been fir&s;t fixed upon &s;ome of the cloth of the i&s;land, and then &s;ewed to the upper end of the pendant which Captain Wallis had left flying on &s;hore, the fir&s;t time of his arrival at Matavai. The prie&s;ts pronounced a long prayer, relative to this part of the ceremony; and after it was ended, the badge of royalty was folded up with great care, and put into the cloth.</P>
<P>The other bundle, which we have already men|tioned under the name of the ark, was next open|ed, at one end; but our party were not permitted to approach near enough to examine its my&s;te|rious contents. The intelligence they obtained re&s;pecting it was, that the <HI>Eatooa,</HI> (or rather what is &s;uppo&s;ed to repre&s;ent him) was concealed in it. This &s;acred repo&s;itory is compo&s;ed of the twi&s;ted fibres of the hu&s;k of the cocoa-nut; and

its figure is roundi&s;h, with one end con&s;iderably thicker than the other.</P>
<P>The pig that had been killed was by this time cleaned, and its entrails taken out. The&s;e hap|pened to have many of tho&s;e convul&s;ive moti|ons, which frequently appear, in different parts, when an animal is killed; and this was con&s;ider|ed as a very favourable omen to the intended expedition. After being expo&s;ed for &s;ome time, the entrails were carried and laid down before the prie&s;ts. While one of them prayed, another clo&s;ely in&s;pected the entrials, and continued tur|ning them gently with a &s;tick. Having been &s;uf|ficiently examined, they were thrown into the fire. The &s;acrificed pig, and its liver, heart, &amp;c. were now put upon the &s;caffold were the dog had been depo&s;ited; and then all the feathers, except the o&s;trich plume, being enclo&s;ed in the ark, an end was put to the whole &s;olemnity.</P>
<P>Four double canoes remained upon the beach, all the morning, before the place of &s;acrifice. A &s;mall platform, covered with palm-leaves, fa&s;tened in my&s;terious knots, was fixed on the fore part of each of the&s;e canoes; and this al&s;o is called a <HI>morai.</HI> Some plantains, cocoa-nuts, bread-fruit, fi&s;h, and other articles, lay upon each of the&s;e naval <HI>morais.</HI> The natives &s;aid, that they belonged to the <HI>Eatooa,</HI> and that they were to attend the fleet that was to be &s;ent out again&s;t Eimeo.</P>
<P><PB N="348" REF="030274_0408_0FE56E9E10C95148">The unfortunate victim, offered on this occa|tion, was to appearance, a middle-aged man, and was one of the lowe&s;t cla&s;s of the people. But it did not appear that they had fixed upon him on account of his having committed any particular crime, that de&s;erved death. It is cer|tain, however, that they u&s;ually &s;elect &s;uch guilty per&s;ons for their &s;acrifices, or el&s;e, vagabonds, who have no vi&s;ible way of procuring an hone&s;t livelihood. Our gentlemen having examined the appearance of the body of the unhappy &s;ufferer, now offered up to the object of the&s;e people's wor&s;hip, ob&s;erved, that it was bloody about the head and face, and much brui&s;ed upon the right temple, which denoted the manner in which he had been killed. And they were informed, that he had been knocked on the head with a &s;tone.</P>
<P>The wretches, who are de&s;tined to &s;uffer on the&s;e occa&s;ions, are never previou&s;ly apprized of their fate. Whenever any one of the principal chiefs deems a human &s;acrifice nece&s;&s;ary, on any great emergency, he fixes upon the victim, and then di&s;patches &s;ome of his tru&s;ty &s;ervants, who fall upon him &s;uddenly, and either &s;tone him to death, or beat out his brains with a club. The &s;overeign is next acquainted with it, who&s;e pre|&s;ence is &s;aid to be ab&s;olutely requi&s;ite at the &s;o|lemn rites that follow; and, indeed, on the late occa&s;ion, Otoo bore a capital part. The &s;olem|nity it&s;elf is termed <HI>Poore Eree,</HI> or the prayer of
<PB N="349" REF="030274_0409_0FE56E9F990F9E70">
the chief; and the victim is called <HI>Taata-tahoo,</HI> or con&s;ecrated man.</P>
<P>The <HI>morai,</HI> were the late &s;acrifice was offered, is always appropriated for the burial of the king of the whole i&s;land, and likewi&s;e of his family, and &s;ome other per&s;ons of di&s;tingui&s;hed rank. It differs little, except in extent, from the com|mon <HI>morais.</HI> Its principal part is a large oblong pile of &s;tones, about thirteen feet in heigth, and contracted towards the top, with a quadrangular area on each &s;ide, loo&s;ely paved with pebbles, under which the bones of the chiefs are depo&s;it|ed. Not far from the end neare&s;t the &s;ea, is the place of &s;acrifice, where is a very large <HI>whatta,</HI> or &s;caffold, on which the offerings of fruits, and other vegetables, are placed; but the animals are laid on a &s;maller one, and the human &s;acrifices are interred under the pavement. There are &s;e|veral reliques &s;cattered about the place; &s;uch as &s;mall &s;tones rai&s;ed in various parts of the pave|ment, &s;ome with bits of cloth fa&s;tened round them, others entirely covered with it; and, upon the &s;ide of the large pile, fronting the area, are a great number of pieces of carved wood, in which their gods are &s;uppo&s;ed to re&s;ide occa&s;i|onally. There is a heap of &s;tones, at one end of the large &s;caffold, with a &s;ort of platform on one &s;ide. On this they depo&s;it all the &s;kulls of the human &s;acrifices, which they take up after they have remained under ground for &s;ome months.
<PB N="350" REF="030274_0410_0FE56EA1B4E08790">
Ju&s;t above them, many of the carved pieces of wood are placed; and here the <HI>maro,</HI> and the other bundle, which was &s;uppo&s;ed to contain the God <HI>Ooro,</HI> were laid, during the celebration of the late &s;olemn rites.</P>
<P>It is probable, that this barbarous cu&s;tom of offering human victims, prevails in all or mo&s;t of the i&s;lands of the Pacific Ocean, however di&s;|tant from each other &s;ome of them may be. And though we &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e, that not more than one per&s;on is &s;acrificed at one time, either at Otaheite, or other i&s;lands; yet the&s;e occa&s;ions, in all probability, occur &s;o frequently, as to make a terrible havock of the human &s;pecies; for Cap|tain Cook reckoned no le&s;s than forty-nine &s;kulls, of former victims, lying before the <HI>morai,</HI> at Attahooroo; and as none of tho&s;e &s;kulls appear|ed to have &s;uffered any con&s;iderable change, or decay, from the weather, it may be inferred, that but a &s;hort time had elap&s;ed &s;ince the&s;e victims had been offered. This horrid practice, though no con&s;ideration whatever can make it cea&s;e to be dete&s;table, might, perhaps, be thought le&s;s detrimental, in &s;ome re&s;pects, if it contributed to impre&s;s any awe for the Deity, or veneration for religion, upon the minds of the &s;pectators. But this was &s;o far from being the ca&s;e on the late occa&s;ion, that though a va&s;t multitude of people had a&s;&s;embled at the <HI>morai,</HI> they &s;hewed very little reverence for what was tran&s;acting.
<PB N="351" REF="030274_0411_0FE56EA7B4E71740">
And Omai happening to arrive, after the cere|monies had begun, many of the i&s;landers throng|ed round him, and were engaged, for the re|maining part of the time, in making him recount &s;ome of his adventures; to which they li&s;tened with great eagerne&s;s of attention, regardle&s;s of the &s;olemn offices which their prie&s;ts were then performing. Indeed, the prie&s;ts them&s;elves, ex|cept the one who &s;u&s;tained the principal part, either from their being familiarized to &s;uch ob|jects, or from their repo&s;ing no great degree of confidence in the efficacy of their religous in|&s;titutions, maintained very little of that &s;olem|nity which is nece&s;&s;ary to give to acts of devo|tion their proper effect. Their habit was but an ordinary one; they conver&s;ed together with great familiarity; and the only attempt they made to pre&s;erve decorum, was by exerting their authority to prevent the populace from encroaching on the very &s;pot where the rites were performed, and to &s;uffer our gentlemen, as &s;trangers, to come forward. They were, however, very candid in the an&s;wers which they gave to any interrogato|ries that were put to them, with regard to this inhuman in&s;titution. And, particularly, on being a&s;ked, what was the de&s;ign of it, they replied that it was an ancient cu&s;tom and was highly agreeable to their god, who came and fed upon the &s;acrifices; in con&s;equence of which, he grant|ed their petitions. It was then objected, that he
<PB N="352" REF="030274_0412_0FE56EA96C245AA0">
certainly did not feed on the&s;e, as he was neither ob&s;erved to do it, nor were the bodies of the &s;a|crificed animals &s;oon con&s;umed; and that as to the corp&s;e of a human victim, they prevented his feeding on that, by interring it. In an&s;wer to the&s;e objections, they gave it as their opinion, that he came in the night, invi&s;ibly, and fed only on the &s;oul or immaterial part, which (the&s;e people &s;ay) remain about the place of &s;acrifice, till the carca&s;e of the victim is totally wa&s;ted by putrefaction.</P>
<P>Human &s;acrifices are not the only barbarous cu&s;tom that &s;till prevails among&s;t the inhabitants of Otaheite, though, in many other re&s;pects, they have emerged from the brutal manners of &s;avage life. Be&s;ides cutting out the jaw bones of their enemies &s;lain in battle, which they carry about with them as trophies, they, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, offer up their bodies to the <HI>Eatooa.</HI> Soon after an engagement, in which they have come off vic|torious, they collect all the dead, and bring them to the <HI>morai,</HI> where, with great form and cere|mony, they dig a large hole, and bury them all in it, as &s;o many offerings to their divinities.</P>
<P>They treat, in a different manner, their own cheifs that fall in battle. Their late king Too|taha, Tubourai-tamaide, and another chief, who were all &s;lain in an engagement with tho&s;e of Tiaraboo, were brought to the <HI>morai</HI> at Attahoo|roo. There the prie&s;ts cut out the bowels be|fore
<PB N="353" REF="030274_0413_0FE56EAAF40788C8">
the great alter; and their dead bodies were afterwards interred in three different places, near the great pile of &s;tones above-mentioned; and the common men, who lo&s;t their lives in the bat|tle, were all buried in one hole, at the foot of the &s;ame pile. This was performed the day after the battle, with much pomp and formality, amid&s;t a numerous concour&s;e of people, as a thank&s;giv|ing offering to the Deity, for the victory they had obtained the preceding day. The vanqui&s;h|ed, in the mean time, had taken refuge in the mountains, where they remained upwards of a week, till the fury of the victors began to abate. A treaty was then &s;et on foot, by which it was agreed, that Otoo &s;hould be proclaimed king of the whole i&s;land; and the &s;olemnity of inve&s;ting him with the <HI>maro,</HI> or badge of royalty, was performed at the &s;ame <HI>morai,</HI> with great magni|ficence.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>AT the clo&s;e of the very extraordinary &s;cene, exhibited at the <HI>morai,</HI> and particularly de&s;cribed in the la&s;t chapter, our party embarked about twelve o'clock, in order to return to Ma|tavai; and in their way, paid a vi&s;it to Towha, who had continued in the little i&s;land, where they met him the preceding day. Some conver&s;ation on public affairs pa&s;&s;ed between Otoo and him; and the latter entreated Captain Cook, once more, to join them as an ally, in their war again&s;t Ei|meo. By his po&s;itive refu&s;al he entirely lo&s;t the good opinion of this chief.</P>
<P><PB REF="030274_0415_0FE56DFC027AB848"><FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P><PB N="355" REF="030274_0416_0FE56EB4B24435B8">Before they &s;eparated, he interrogated our gen|tlemen concerning the &s;olemnity, at which they had been pre&s;ent; and a&s;ked, particularly, if it an|&s;wered their expectations; what opinion they en|tertained of its efficacy; and whether &s;uch acts of wor&s;hip were frequent in their own country? They had been &s;ilent during the celebration of the hor|rid ceremony; but, as &s;oon as it was completed, freely expre&s;&s;ed their &s;entiments upon the &s;ub|ject, to Otoo, and his attendants; con&s;equently Captain Cook did not conceal his dete&s;tation of it, in this conver&s;ation with Towha. Exclu&s;ive of the barbarity of the bloody cu&s;tom, he urged the unrea&s;onablene&s;s of it, alledging that &s;uch a &s;acrifice, in&s;tead of making the <HI>Eatooa</HI> propitious to their nation, would excite his vengeance; and that, from this very circum&s;tance, he concluded, that their intended expedition again&s;t Maheine, would be un&s;ucce&s;sful. This was proceeding to great lengths upon conjecture; but there was lit|tle danger of being mi&s;taken; for re&s;pecting this war, there were three parties in this i&s;land, one violent for it, another perfectly indifferent about it; and the third avowed &s;upporters of Maheine, and his cau&s;e. Under the&s;e circum&s;tances, it was not probable that &s;uch a plan of military opera|tions would be &s;ettled, as could in&s;ure &s;ucce&s;s. Omai acted as interpreter, in conveying the Cap|tain's &s;entiments to Towha, on the &s;ubject of the late horrid &s;acrifice; and he &s;upported his ar|guments
<PB N="356" REF="030274_0417_0FE56EB6A7390BD0">
with &s;uch &s;pirit, that the chief appeared to be extremely angry; e&s;pecially, on being in|formed, that if he had taken away the life of a man in England, as he had done here, his rank would not have protected him from an ignominious death. Upon this, he exclaimed, <HI>maeno! maeno!</HI> (vile! vile!) and would not hear a &s;yllable more about it. Many of the natives were pre&s;ent at this debate; particularly the attendants and &s;er|vants of Towha; and when Omai mentioned the puni&s;hment that would in England be inflict|ed upon the greate&s;t man, if he dared to kill the meane&s;t &s;ervant, they li&s;tened very attentively; and perhaps, on this &s;ubject, they thought differ|ently from their ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>Leaving Towha, our gentlemen proceeded to Oparre, where Otoo &s;olicited them to pa&s;s the night. They landed in the evening; and, on their way to his habitation, had an opportunity of ob&s;erving how the&s;e people amu&s;e them&s;elves, in their private <HI>heevas.</HI> They &s;aw about a hun|dred of them &s;itting in a hou&s;e: in the mid&s;t of whom were two women, and an old man be|hind each of them, beating gently upon a drum; and the women, at intervals, &s;inging with great &s;oftne&s;s and delicacy. The a&s;&s;embly were very at|tentive, and &s;eemed, as it were, ab&s;orbed in the plea&s;ure the mu&s;ic gave them; few of them tak|ing any notice of the &s;trangers, and the perform|ers never once cea&s;ing. When the party arrived
<PB N="357" REF="030274_0418_0FE56EB82FD78B18">
at Otoo's hou&s;e, it was almo&s;t dark. Here they were entertained with one of their public <HI>heevas,</HI> or plays, in which his three &s;i&s;ters repre|&s;ented the principal characters. This they call a <HI>heeva ra&auml;,</HI> and no per&s;on is &s;uffered to enter the hou&s;e or area, where it is exhibited. This is al|ways the ca&s;e, when the royal &s;i&s;ters are the per|formers. Their dre&s;s on this occa&s;ion, was truly elegant and picture&s;que, and they acquit|ted them&s;elves in a very di&s;tingui&s;hed manner; though &s;ome comic interludes, wherein four men were the performers, &s;eemed to afford greater entertainment to the audience, which was numer|ous. The Captain and his companions proceed|ed, the next morning, to Matavai, leaving Otoo at Oparre; but his mother, &s;i&s;ters, and many other women, attended the Captain on board, and Otoo followed a &s;hort time after.</P>
<P>While Otoo and Captain Cook had been <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">|&s;ent from the &s;hips, they had been &s;paringly &s;up|plied with fruit, and had not many vi&s;itors. Af|ter their return we had abundance of company and provi&s;ion. On the 4th, a party of us, among whom was Otoo, dined a&s;hore with Omai, who provided excellent fare, con&s;i&s;ting of fi&s;h, fowls, pork, and puddings. Dinner being over, Cap|tain Cook accompanied Otoo back to his dewl|ing, where he found all his &s;ervants bu&s;y in getting a quantity of provi&s;ion ready for him. Among&s;t other articles, there was a large hog,
<PB N="358" REF="030274_0419_0FE56EB9CF3599B8">
which they killed in his pre&s;ence. There was al&s;o a large pudding; the whole proce&s;s in mak|ing which the Captain &s;aw. It was compo&s;ed of bread-fruit, plantains, taro, and plam or pandanus-nuts, each ra&s;ped, &s;craped, or beat up fine, and baked by it&s;elf. A quantity of the juice of co|coa-nut-kernels, was put into a kind of wooden tray. The other articles, hot from the oven, were put into this ve&s;&s;el; together with &s;ome hot &s;tones, in order to make the contents &s;immer. Three or four per&s;ons were employed in &s;tirring up the &s;everal ingredients till they were perfect|ly incorporated, and the juice of the cocoa-nut was, turned to oil; and the whole ma&s;s, at la&s;t, was nearly of the con&s;i&s;tency of a ha&s;ty-pudding. The hog being baked, and the pudding being made, they, together with two living hogs, &s;ome bread fruit and cocoa-nuts, were &s;ent on board the Captain's &s;hip in a canoe, followed by him and all the royal family.</P>
<P>A young ram, of the Cape-bread, that had been lambed, and carefully brought up on board Captain Cook's &s;hip, was killed by a dog the fol|lowing day. This was the more to be regretted at it was the only one of that breed that we had; and only one of the Engli&s;h breed was now remaining.</P>
<P>On the 7th, in the evening, we exhibited &s;ome fire-works before a va&s;t concour&s;e of people, &s;ome of whom were highly entertained, but the
<PB N="359" REF="030274_0420_0FE548A86B26E000">
greater number were much terrified with the ex|hibition; in&s;omuch, that they could hardly be prevailed on to keep together to &s;ee the whole of the entertainment. What concluded the bu|&s;ine&s;s, was a table-rocket. It flew off the table and di&s;per&s;ed the whole crowd in an in&s;tant; even the mo&s;t re&s;olute among&s;t them now fled with precipitation.</P>
<P>A party of us dined, the next day, with Oedidee, on fi&s;h and pork. The hog, which weighed about thirty pounds, was alive, dre&s;&s;ed and upon the table within the hour. Soon af<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> we had dined, Otoo appeared, and enquired <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">f Captain Cook, if his belly was full? who an|&s;wered in the affirmative. "Then come along with me," &s;aid Otoo. The Captain accordingly attended him to his father's where he &s;aw &s;everal people employed in dre&s;&s;ing two girls, with fine cloth, after a very &s;ingular fa&s;hion. There were &s;everal pieces of cloth, and the one end of each piece was held over the heads of the girls, while the remainder was wrapped round their bodies, under the arm-pits. The upper ends were then &s;uffered to fall down, and hang in folds to the ground, over the other. Round the out&s;ide of all, were then wrapped &s;everal pieces of cloth of va|rious colours, which con&s;iderably increa&s;ed the &s;ize; it being five or &s;ix yards in circuit; and the weight of this &s;ingular attire, was as much as the poor girls could well &s;upport. To each were
<PB N="360" REF="030274_0421_0FE56EBDDCF6A088">
hung two <HI>taames,</HI> or brea&s;t-plates, in order to embeli&s;h the whole, and give it a picture&s;que ap|pearance. Thus equipped, they were taken on board the &s;hip, together with &s;everal hogs, and a quantity of fruit, which, together with this cloth, was a pre&s;ent to Captain Cook from Otoo's fa|ther. Tho&s;e who are dre&s;&s;ed in this manner, are called <HI>atee;</HI> but, this ceremony is never perform|ed, except where large pre&s;ents of cloth are to be made. We never &s;aw it practi&s;ed upon any other occa&s;ion; but both Captain Cook and Cap|tain Clerke had cloth pre&s;ented to them after|wards, wrapped round the bearers in the &s;ame manner. The next day, Captain Cook received a pre&s;ent of five hogs, and &s;ome fruit, from Otoo; and one hog, and &s;ome fruit from each of his &s;i&s;ters. Other provi&s;ions were al&s;o in great plen|ty. Great quantities of mackarel had been caught here by the natives, for two or three &s;ucce&s;&s;ive days; &s;ome of which were &s;old on board the &s;hips.</P>
<P>Otoo was equally attentive to &s;upply our wants, and contribute to our amu&s;ement. On the 10th, he treated a party of us at Oparre, with a play. His three &s;i&s;ters were the performers, and their dre&s;&s;es were new and elegant, much more &s;o than we had met with in any of the&s;e i&s;lands.</P>
<P>The principal object, however, that the Cap|tain had now in view, in going to Oparre, was to &s;ee an embalmed corp&s;e, near the re&s;idence of Otoo. On enquiry, he found it to be the re|mains

of Tee, a chief whom he well knew, when he la&s;t vi&s;ited this i&s;land. It was lying in an elegant <HI>toopapaoo,</HI> in all re&s;pects &s;imilar to that at Oheitepeha, in which the remains of Waheia|dooa are depo&s;ited. We found the body was under cover, within the <HI>toopapaoo,</HI> and wrapped up in cloth. At the Captain's de&s;ire, the per|&s;on who had the care of it, brought it out, and placed it on a kind of bier, &s;o as to give a per|fect view of it; but we were not admitted within the pales that enclo&s;ed the <HI>toopapaoo.</HI> The corp&s;e having been thus exhibited, he ornamented the place with mats and cloths, di&s;po&s;ed in &s;uch a manner as to produce a plea&s;ing effect. The body was entire in every part; and putrefaction &s;eemed hardly to be begun, not the lea&s;t di&s;a|greeable &s;mell proceeding from it; though this is one of the hotte&s;t climates, and Tee had been above four months dead. There was, indeed, a &s;hrinking of the mu&s;cular parts and eyes, but the hair and nails were in their original &s;tate, and the &s;everal joints were pliable. On enquiry into their method of pre&s;erving their dead bodies, we were informed, that, &s;oon after they are dead, they are di&s;embowelled, by drawing the inte&s;tines, and other <HI>vi&s;cera,</HI> out at the <HI>anus,</HI> and the whole ca|vity is &s;tuffed with cloth; and when any moi&s;|ture appeared, it was immediately dried up, and the bodies rubbed all over with perfumed co|coa-nut-oil; which, frequently repeated, pre|&s;erved
<PB N="362" REF="030274_0424_0FE56EC01D93CED0">
them &s;everal months; after which they moulder away gradually. Omai informed us, that the bodies of all their great men, who die a na|tural death, are thus pre&s;erved; and are expo&s;ed to public view for a very con&s;iderable time af|ter. At fir&s;t, they are exhibited every fine day; afterwards, the intervals become greater and greater; and, at la&s;t, they are very &s;eldom to be &s;een.</P>
<P>We quitted Oparre in the evening, leaving Otoo, and all the royal family. The Captain &s;aw none of them till the 12th; when all, except the chief him&s;elf, honoured him with a vi&s;it. He was gone, they &s;aid, at Attahooroo, to a&s;&s;i&s;t at another human &s;acrifice, &s;ent by the chief of Tiaraboo to be offered up at the <HI>morai.</HI> This &s;econd in&s;tance, within &s;o &s;hort a period, was a melancholy proof, that the victims of his bloody &s;uper&s;tition are very numerous among&s;t this hu|mane people. The Captain would have been pre&s;ent at this &s;acrifice al&s;o, had he been earlier informed of it, but now it was too late. For the &s;ame rea&s;on, he omitted being pre&s;ent at a public tran&s;action, at Oparre, the preceeding day, when Otoo, with great &s;olemnity, re&s;tored to the adherents of the late king Tootaha, the lands and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, of which, after his death they had been deprived.</P>
<P>Otoo returned the next evening, from exer|ci&s;ing the mo&s;t di&s;agreeable of his royal duties;

and, the next day, being honoured with his com|pany, the Captains Cook and Clerke, mounted on hor&s;eback, and rode round the plain of Ma|tavai, to the a&s;toni&s;hment of a va&s;t train of &s;pec|tators. Once or twice, before this, Omai had, indeed, attempted to get on a hor&s;e; but he had as often fallen off, before he could contrive to &s;eat him&s;elf properly; this was, therefore, the fir&s;t time they had &s;een any body on hor&s;eback. What the Captains had begun, was repeated dai|ly, by one or another of our people; and yet the curio&s;ity of the natives continued unabated. After they had &s;een the u&s;e that was made of the&s;e animals, they were exceedingly delighted with them; and we were of opinion, that they conveyed to them a better idea of the greatne&s;s of other nations, than all the novelties that their European vi&s;itors had carried among&s;t them.</P>
<P>The next day, Etary, or Olla, the God of Bo|labola, removed from the neighbourhood of Ma|tavai, to Oparre, attended by &s;everal &s;ailing ca|noes. Otoo, we were told, did not approve of his being &s;o near our &s;tation, where his people could more conveniently invade our property. Otoo, it mu&s;t be acknowledged, took every pru|dent method to prevent thefts and robberies; and it was principally owing to his regulations, that &s;o few were committed. He had erected a &s;mall hou&s;e or two, behind our po&s;t; and two others near our tents, between the river and the
<PB N="364" REF="030274_0427_0FE548A6DE10EA28">
&s;ea. Some of his own people continually kept watch in all the&s;e places; and, as his father u&s;ually re&s;ided at Matavai Point, we were, in a manner, &s;urrounded by them. They not only defended us in the night from thieves, but they had an opportunity of ob&s;erving every thing that pa&s;&s;ed in the day; and were ready to receive con|tributions from &s;uch girls, as were privately con|nected with our people, which was u&s;ually done every morning; &s;o that the mea&s;ures he had taken to &s;ecure our &s;afety, an&s;wered the more e&s;&s;ential purpo&s;e of enlarging his own profits.</P>
<P>Otoo acquainted Captain Cook, that his pre|&s;ence was required at Oparre, where an audience was to be given to the great per&s;onage from Bo|labola, and begged he would accompany him thither. The Captain readily con&s;ented, expect+ing to meet with &s;omething de&s;erving his notice. Accordingly, they &s;et out on the 16th, attended by Mr. Ander&s;on. Nothing, however, occur|red, that was intere&s;ting or curious. Etary and his followers pre&s;ented &s;ome coar&s;e cloth and hogs to Otoo, with &s;ome ceremony, and a &s;et &s;peech. After this a con&s;ultation was held be|tween them and &s;ome other chiefs, about their expedition to Eimeo. Etary, at fir&s;t, di&s;approved of it; but his objections were at length over|ruled. It appeared, indeed, the next day, that it was too late to deliberate upon this bu&s;ine&s;s; for, in the evening, a me&s;&s;enger arrived with in|telligence,
<PB N="365" REF="030274_0428_0FE56EC8F99FDC90">
that there had been &s;ome &s;kirmi&s;hes, but that the lo&s;s or advantage, on either &s;ide, was incon&s;iderable.</P>
<P>Captain Cook, Mr. Ander&s;on, and Omai, in the morning of the 18th, went again to Oparre, accompanied by Otoo; taking with them the &s;heep which the Captain intended to leave upon the i&s;land. They con&s;i&s;ted of an Engli&s;h ram and ewe, and three Cape ewes; all which he made a pre&s;ent of to Otoo. All the three cows had taken the bull; he therefore thought it advi&s;e|able to devide them, and carry &s;ome to Ulietea. With this view, he ordered them to be brought before him, and propo&s;ed to Etary, that if he would leave his bull with Otoo, he &s;hould have this and one of the cows. To this propo&s;al, Etary, at fir&s;t, &s;tarted &s;ome objections; but, at la&s;t, agreed to it; however, as the cattle were putting into the boat, one of Etary's followers oppo&s;ed the making an exchange whatever.</P>
<P>The Captain, upon this, &s;u&s;pecting that Etary had agreed to the arrangement, for the pre&s;ent, only to plea&s;e him, dropped the idea of an ex|change; and finally determined to leave them all with Otoo; whom he &s;trictly enjoined not to &s;uf|fer them to be removed from Oparre, till he &s;hould have got a &s;tock of young ones; which he might then di&s;po&s;e of to his friends, or &s;end to the neighbouring i&s;lands.</P>
<P><PB N="366" REF="030274_0429_0FE56ECB4BA35308">This matter being &s;ettled, our gentlemen left Etary and his party, and attended Otoo to another place, not far di&s;tant, where they found the &s;er|vants of a chief, waiting with a hog, a pig, and a dog, as a pre&s;ent from their ma&s;ter to the king. The&s;e were delivered with the u&s;ual ceremonies, and an harangue, in which the &s;peaker enquired after the health of Otoo, and of his principle people. This compliment was re-echoed in the name of Otoo, by one of his mini&s;ters; and then the di&s;pute with Eimeo was formally di&s;cu&s;&s;ed. The deputies of this chief were advocates for pro&s;ecuting the war with vigour, advi&s;ing Otoo to offer a human &s;acrifice on the occa&s;ion. A chief, who con&s;tantly attended the per&s;on of Otoo oppo&s;ed it, &s;eemingly with great &s;trength of argument. The Captain was now confirmed in his opinion, that Otoo never entered heartily into the &s;pirit of this war. He received repeated me&s;&s;ages from Towha, urging him to ha&s;ten to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>Having dined with Otoo, our party returned to Matavai, leaving him at Oparre. This day, and the 19th, we were very &s;paringly &s;upplied with fruit. Otoo being informed of this, he and his brother, who had particularly attached him|&s;elf to Captain Clerke, came from Oparre, with a large &s;upply for both &s;hips. All the royal family came the next day with pre&s;ents, &s;o that we now had more provi&s;ions than we could con&s;ume.</P>
<P><PB N="367" REF="030274_0430_0FE56ECCE7B8F9D0">Our water being all on board, and every thing put in order, the Captain began to think of quit|ting the i&s;land, that he might have a &s;ufficient time for vi&s;iting others in this neighbourhood. We therefore removed our ob&s;ervatories and in|&s;truments from the &s;hore, and bent the &s;ails.</P>
<P>Early the next morning, Otoo came on board to inform Captain Cook, that the war canoes of Matavai, and of three other di&s;tricts, were going to join tho&s;e belonging to Oparre, and that part of the i&s;land; and that there would be a general review there. The &s;quadron of Matavai was &s;oon after in motion; and after parading for &s;ome time about the bay, a&s;&s;embled a&s;hore, near the middle of it. Captain Cook now went in his boat to take a &s;urvey of them.</P>
<P>What they call their war canoes, which are tho&s;e with &s;tages, on which they &s;ight, amount to about &s;ixty in number; there are nearly as many more of a &s;maller &s;ize. The Captain was ready to have attended them to Oparre; but the chiefs &s;oon after formed a re&s;olution, that they would not move till the next day. This appeared to be a fortunate delay, as it afforded him &s;ome opportunity of getting &s;ome in&s;ight into their manner of fighting. He therefore de&s;ired Otoo to give orders, that &s;ome of them &s;hould go through the nece&s;&s;ary manoeuvres. Accordingly, two of them were ordered out into the bay; in one of which Otoo Capt. Cook, and Mr. King, embarked,
<PB N="368" REF="030274_0431_0FE56ECEC0D228C8">
and Omai went on board the other. As &s;oon as they had got &s;ufficient &s;ea-room, they faced, ad|vanced, and retreated by turns, as quick as their rowers could paddle. In the mean time, the warriors on the &s;tages flouri&s;hed their weapons, and played a variety of anticks, which could an|&s;wer no other purpo&s;e than that of rou&s;ing their pa&s;&s;ions, to prepare them for the on&s;et. Otoo &s;tood by the &s;ide of one &s;tage, giving the nece&s;|&s;ary orders, when to advance, and when to re|treat. Great judgment, and a very quick eye, &s;eemed requi&s;ite in this department, to &s;eize eve|ry advantage, and to avoid every di&s;advantage. At length, after &s;everal times advancing to, and retreating from each other, the two canoes, clo&s;|&s;ed &s;tage to &s;tage; and after a &s;evere, though &s;hort conflict, all the troops on Otoo's &s;tage were &s;uppo&s;ed to be killed, and Omai and his a&s;&s;o|ciates boarded them, when in&s;tantly Otoo, and all the paddlers in his canoe, leaped into the &s;ea, as if reduced to the nece&s;&s;ity of pre&s;erving their lives by &s;wimming.</P>
<P>According to Omai's information; their naval engagements are not always conducted in this manner. They &s;ometimes la&s;h the two ve&s;&s;els together, head to head, and fight till the war|riors on one &s;ide or the other are killed. But this clo&s;e combat it never practi&s;ed, except when the contending parties are determined to conquer or die. Indeed, one or the other mu&s;t infallibly
<PB N="369" REF="030274_0432_0FE56ED4F4566448">
happen; for they never give quarter, unle&s;s it be to re&s;erve their pri&s;oners for a more cruel death the day following.</P>
<P>All the power and &s;trength of the&s;e i&s;lands lie &s;olely in their navies. A general engagement on land we never heard of here; and all there de|ci&s;ive battles are fought on the water. When the time and place of battle are fixed upon by both parties, the preceding day and night are &s;pent in fea&s;ting and diver&s;ions. When the morn|ing approaches, they launch the canoes, make every nece&s;&s;ary preparation, and, with the day, begin the battle; the fate of which, in general, decides the di&s;pute. The vanqui&s;hed endeavour to &s;ave them&s;elves by a precipitate flight; and tho&s;e who reach the &s;hore fly, with their friends, to the mountains; for the victors, before their fury abates, &s;pare neither the aged, nor women, or children. They a&s;&s;emble the next day, at the <HI>morai,</HI> to return thanks to the <HI>Eatooa</HI> for the vic|tory, and offer up the &s;lain and the pri&s;oners, as &s;acrifices. A treaty is then &s;et on foot; and the conquerors u&s;ually obtain their own terms; by which large di&s;tricts of land, and even whole i&s;lands, &s;ometimes change their owners. Omai &s;aid he was once taken a pri&s;oner by the men of Bolabola, and conducted to that i&s;land, where he and many others would have &s;uffered death the next day, had they not been fortunate enough to e&s;cape in the night.</P>
<P><PB N="370" REF="030274_0433_0FE56ED6A9A6D780">This mock-fight being over, Omai put on his &s;uit of armour, mounted a &s;tage in one of the canoes, and, thus equipped, was pad|dled all along the &s;hore of the bay, that every one might have a perfect view of him. His coat of mail, however, did not engage the attention of the multitude &s;o much as was expected. The novelty was in a great degree lo&s;t upon &s;ome of them, who had &s;een a part of it before; and there were others, who had conceived &s;uch a di&s;|like to Omai, from his folly and imprudence at this place, that they would hardly look at any thing that was exhibited by him, however &s;ingu|lar and new.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>OTOO, and his father, came on board, in the morning of the 22d&punc; to know when Captain Cook propo&s;ed &s;ailing. For, hearing
<PB N="2" REF="030274_0444_0FE56F56728B4520">
that there was a good harbour at Eimeo, he had informed them, that he &s;hould vi&s;it that i&s;land on his pa&s;&s;age to Hu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">heine; and they propo&s;ed to accompany him, and that their fleet &s;hould &s;ail at the &s;ame time to reinforce Towha. Being ready to take his departure, he &s;ubmitted to them the appointment of the day; and the Wedne&s;day following was determined upon; when he was to receive on board Otoo, his father, mother, and the whole family. The&s;e points being agreed on, the Captain propo&s;ed immediately &s;etting out for Oparre, where all the fleet was to a&s;&s;emble this day, and to be reviewed.</P>
<P>As Captain Cook was getting into his boat, news arrived that a treaty had been concluded be|tween Towha and Maheine, and Towha's fleet had returned to Attahooroo. From this unex|pected event, the war canoes, in&s;tead of rendez|vou&s;ing at Oparre, were ordered to their re&s;pective di&s;tricts. Captain Cook, however, followed Otoo to Oparre, accompanied by Mr. King and Omai. Soon after their arrival, a me&s;&s;enger arrived from Eimeo, and related the conditions of the peace, or rather truce, it being only for a limitted time. The terms being di&s;advantageous to Otaheite, Otoo was &s;everely cen&s;ured, who&s;e delay, in &s;end|ing reinforcements, had obliged Towha to &s;ubmit to a di&s;graceful accommodation. It was even currently reported, that Towha, re&s;enting the treatment he had received, had declared, that
<PB N="3" REF="030274_0445_0FE56F2368639598">
immediately after Captain Cook's departure, he would join his forces to tho&s;e of Tiaraboo, and attack Otoo. This called upon the Captain to declare, that he was determined to e&s;pou&s;e the in|tere&s;t of his friend: and that whoever pre&s;umed to attack him, &s;hould experience the weight of his di&s;plea&s;ure, when he returned to their i&s;land.</P>
<P>This declaration, probably, had the de&s;ired effect, and, if Towha did entertain any &s;uch ho&s;|tile intention at fir&s;t, we heard no more of the report. Whappai, the father of Otoo, highly di&s;approved of the peace, and cen&s;ured Towha for concluding it. This old man wi&s;ely con&s;idered that Captain Cook's going with them to Eimeo, might have been of &s;ingular &s;ervice to their cau&s;e, though he &s;hould not interfere in the quarrel. He therefore concluded, that Otoo had acted prudently in waiting for the Captain; though it prevented his giving that early a&s;&s;i&s;tance to Towha which he expected.</P>
<P>While we were debating on this &s;ubject at Oparre, a me&s;&s;enger arrived from Towha, de&s;iring the attendance of Otoo the next day, at the <HI>moria</HI> in Attahooroo, to return thanks, to the Gods for the peace he had concluded. Captain Cook was a&s;ked to attend; but being much out of order, cho&s;e rather to decline it. De&s;irous, however, of knowing what ceremony might be exhibited on &s;o memorable an occa&s;ion, he &s;ent Mr. King and Omai to ob&s;erve the particulars, and returned to
<PB N="4" REF="030274_0446_0FE56F666F66E728">
his &s;hip, attended by Otoo's mother, his three &s;i&s;ters, and &s;everal other woman. At fir&s;t, the Captain imagined that this numerous train came into his boat, in order to get a pa&s;&s;age to Matavai. But they a&s;&s;ured him, they intended pa&s;&s;ing the night on board, for the purpo&s;e of curing the di&s;order he complained of; which was a rheu|matic pain, extending from the hip to the foot. He accepted the friendly offer, had a bed pre|pared for them upon the cabin floor, and &s;ub|mitted him&s;elf to their directions. He was fir&s;t de&s;ired to lie down among&s;t them, when all tho&s;e who could get near him, began to &s;queeze him with both hands all over the body, but more par|ticularly on the parts complained of, till they made his bones crack, and his fle&s;h became almo&s;t a mummy. In &s;hort, after &s;uffering this &s;evere di&s;cipline about a quarter of an hour, he was happy to get away from them. The operation, however, gave him immediate relief, and encou|raged him to a repetition of the &s;ame di&s;cipline, before he retired to bed; and it was &s;o effectual, that he found him&s;elf pretty ea&s;y the whole night after. His female phy&s;icians very obligingly re|peated their pre&s;cription the next morning, before they left him, and again in the evening, when they returned; after which, the cure being perfected, they took their leave of the Captain the following morning. This is called <HI>romee,</HI> among the na|tives, an operation far exceeding that of the fle&s;h-bru&s;h,
<PB N="5" REF="030274_0447_0FE56F2888D27BE0">
or any external friction. It is univer&s;ally practi&s;ed among&s;t the&s;e i&s;landers, and generally by women. If, at any time, a per&s;on appears languid and tired, and &s;its down by any of them, they practi&s;e the <HI>romee</HI> upon his legs; and it al|ways has an excellent effect.</P>
<P>On Thur&s;day the 25th of September, Otoo, Mr. King, and Omai, returned from Attahooroo; and Mr. King gave a narrative of what he had &s;een to the following effect: "At &s;un-&s;et, we embarked in a canoe, and left Oparre. About nine o'clock we landed at that extremity of Tet|taha, which joins to Attahooroo. The meeting of Otoo and Towha, I expected, would be inter|e&s;ting. Otoo and his attendants &s;eated them&s;elves on the beach, near the canoe in which Towha &s;at. He was then a&s;leep; but being awakened, and Otoo's name being metioned to him, a plantain-tree and dog were immediately laid at Otoo's feet; and &s;everal of Towha's people came and conver&s;ed with him. After I had been, for &s;ome time, &s;eated clo&s;e to Otoo, Towha neither &s;tirring from his canoe, nor &s;aying any thing to us, I repaired to him. He a&s;ked me if <HI>Toote</HI> was di&s;|plea&s;ed with him; I an&s;wered, No; and that he was his <HI>taio</HI>; and that I was ordered to go to At|tahooroo, to let him know it. Omai then en|tered into a long conver&s;ation with this chief; but I could not gather any information from him. On my returning to Otoo, he de&s;ired that I &s;hould
<PB N="6" REF="030274_0448_0FE56F602C5B8B88">
go to eat, and then to &s;leep; in con&s;equence of which Omai and I left him. On que&s;tioning Omai on that head, he &s;aid, Towha was lame, and therefore could not &s;tir; but that Otoo and he would &s;oon conver&s;e together in private. This was probably true; for tho&s;e we left with Otoo came to us in a little time; and about ten mi|nutes after, Otoo him&s;elf arrived, when we all went to &s;leep in his canoe.</P>
<P>The <HI>kava</HI> was the next morning in great plenty. One man drank to &s;uch exce&s;s that he lo&s;t his &s;en&s;es, and appeared to be convul&s;ed. He was held by two men, who bu&s;ied them&s;elves in pluck|ing off his hair by the roots. I left this &s;pectacle to &s;ee a more affecting one. It was the meeting of Towha and his wife, and a young girl, who was &s;aid to be his daughter. After the ceremony of cutting their heads, and di&s;charging plenty of blood and tears, they wa&s;hed, embraced the chief, and &s;eemed perfectly unconcerned. But the young girl's &s;ufferings were not yet concluded. Terri|diri (Oberea's &s;on) arrived; and &s;he, with great compo&s;ure, repeated tho&s;e ceremonies to him which &s;he had ju&s;t performed on meeting her fa|ther. Towha having brought a war-canoe from Eimeo, I enquired if he had killed the people belonging to her; and was informed, that there was not a per&s;on in her when &s;he was captured.</P>
<P>About ten or eleven o'clock we left Tettaha, and landed clo&s;e to the <HI>morai</HI> of Attahooroo early
<PB N="7" REF="030274_0449_0FE56F0DD9E25F90">
in the afternoon. Three canoes lay hauled upon the beach, oppo&s;ite the <HI>morai,</HI> having three hogs in each. We expected the &s;olemnity would have been performed the &s;ame afternoon; but nothing was done, as neither Towha nor Potatou had joined us. A chief came from Eimeo with a &s;mall pig, and a plantain-tree, which he placed at Otoo's feet. They conver&s;ed &s;ome time together, and the Eimeo chief often repeating the words <HI>Warry, Warry,</HI> "fal&s;e." Otoo was probably re|lating to him what he had heard, and the other contradicted it.</P>
<P>The next day, Towha and Potatou, with &s;even or eight large canoes, arrived, and landed near the <HI>morai.</HI> Several plantain-trees were brought to Otoo, on behalf of different chiefs. Towha re|mained in his canoe. The ceremony was com|menced by the principal prie&s;t, who brought out the <HI>maro,</HI> wrapped up in a bundle of a conic &s;hape. The&s;e were placed at the head of what I &s;uppo&s;ed to be a grave. Then three prie&s;ts &s;at down, at the other end of the grave; having with them a plantain-tree, a branch of &s;ome other kind of tree, and the &s;heath of the flower of the cocoa-nut-tree.</P>
<P>The prie&s;ts &s;eparately repeated &s;entences; and at intervals, two, and &s;ometimes all three, chanted a melancholy ditty, very little attended to by the natives. This kind of recitative continued near an hour. Then, after a &s;hort prayer, the chief
<PB N="8" REF="030274_0450_0FE56F0C524FB6B0">
prie&s;t uncovered the <HI>maro,</HI> and Otoo ro&s;e up, and warpped it about him, holding in his hand a bonnet, compo&s;ed of the red feathrs of the tropic bird, mixed with other blacki&s;h feathers. He &s;tooped oppo&s;ite the three prie&s;ts, who continued their prayers for about ten minutes; when a man ri&s;ing &s;uddenly from the crowd, &s;aid &s;omething ending with <HI>heiva!</HI> and the crowd echoed back to him three times <HI>Earee!</HI> The company then re|paired to the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of a large pile of &s;tones, where is the kings <HI>morai</HI>; which is not much unlike a large grave. Here the &s;ame ceremony was again performed, and with three cheers. The <HI>maro</HI> was now warpped up, and ornamented by the addition of a &s;mall piece of red feathers.</P>
<P>The people now proceeded to a large hut, near the <HI>morai,</HI> where they &s;eated them&s;elves in &s;olemn order. An oration was then made by a man of Tiaraboo, which ended in about three minutes. He was followed by a man of Attahooroo; Po|tatou &s;poke next, and with much more fluency and grace than any of them. Tooteo, Otoo's orator, exhibited after him, and then a man from Eimeo. Some other Speeches were made, but not attended to. Omai &s;aid, that the &s;ub&s;tance of their &s;peeches recommended friend&s;hip, and not fighting; but as many of the &s;peakers ex|pre&s;&s;ed them&s;elves with great warmth, there were, perhaps, &s;ome recriminations and prote&s;tations of their future good intentions. In the mid&s;t of
<PB N="9" REF="030274_0451_0FE56F8A8357A2F8">
their harangues a man of Attahooroo ro&s;e up, having a &s;ling fa&s;tened to his wai&s;t, and a large &s;tone upon his &s;houlder. After parading for about fifteen minutes in the open &s;pace, and chanting a few &s;hort &s;entences, he threw the &s;tone down. This &s;tone, together with a plantain-tree that lay at Otoo's feet, were, at the conclu&s;ion of the &s;peeches, carried to the <HI>morai;</HI> one of the prie&s;ts, and Otoo with him, &s;aying &s;omething upon the occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>Returning to Oparre, the &s;ea-breeze having &s;et in, we were obliged to land, and had a plea&s;ant walk from Tettaha to Oparre. A tree, with two large bundles of dried leaves &s;u&s;pended upon it, pointed out the boundary of the two di&s;tricts. We were accompanied by the man who had per|formed the ceremony of the &s;tone and &s;ling. With him Otoo's father held a long conver&s;ation, and appeared extremely angry. He was enraged, as I under&s;tood, at the part which Towha had taken in the Eimeo bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>From what can be judged of this &s;olemnity, as related by Mr. King, it had not been only a thank&s;giving, as Omai told us, but rather a con|firmation of the treaty. The grave, mentioned by Mr. King, appears to be the very &s;pot where the celebration of the rites began, when the human &s;acrifice was offered, at which Captain Cook was pre&s;ent, and before which the victim was laid.

their kings with the <HI>maro.</HI> Omai, who had &s;een the ceremony when Otoo was made king, de|&s;cribed the whole &s;olemnity, when we were here; which is nearly the &s;ame as that now de&s;cribed by Mr. King; though, perhaps, upon a very differ|ent occa&s;ion. The plantain-tree is always the fir&s;t thing introduced in all their religious cere|monies, as well as in all their public and private debates; and, probably, on many other occa&s;ions. While Towha was at Eimeo, he &s;ent one or more me&s;&s;engers to Otoo every day. Every me&s;&s;enger, at all times, carried a young plantain-tree in his hand, which he laid at the feet of Otoo, before he mentioned his errand; then &s;eated him&s;elf be|fore him, and related the particulars of his me&s;|&s;age. When two men are in &s;uch high di&s;pute that blows are expected to en&s;ue, if one &s;hould lay a plantain-tree before the other, they both be|come cool, and proceed in the argument without further animo&s;ity. It is, indeed, the olive branch of the&s;e people on all occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>As our friends knew that we were upon the point of &s;ailing, they all paid us a vi&s;it on the 26th, and brought more hogs with them than we wanted; for, having no &s;alt left to pre&s;erve any, we had fully &s;ufficient for our pre&s;ent u&s;e.</P>
<P>Captain Cook accompanied Otoo, the next day, to Oparre; and before he left it, took a &s;urvey of the cattle and poultry, which he had con&s;igned to his friend's care. Every thing was in a pro|mi&s;ing
<PB N="11" REF="030274_0453_0FE56F0FB9A1BD08">
way; and &s;eemed properly attended to. Two of the gee&s;e, as well as two of the ducks, were &s;itting; but the pea-hen and turkey-hen had neither of them begun to lay. He took four goats from Otoo, two of which he intended to leave at Ulietea; and re&s;erve the other two for the u&s;e of any other i&s;lands he might touch at in his pa&s;&s;age to the north.</P>
<P>The following circum&s;tance concerning Otoo will &s;hew, that the people of this i&s;land are capa|ble of much addre&s;s and art, to accompli&s;h their purpo&s;es. Among&s;t other things, which Captain Cook had, at different times, given to this chief, was a &s;pying-gla&s;s. Having been two or three days po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of it, he, perhaps grew tired of its novelty, or di&s;covered that it could not be of any u&s;e to him, he therefore carried it, privately, to Captain Clerke; telling him, that, as he had &s;hewn great friend&s;hip for him, he had got a pre|&s;ent for him, which, he &s;uppo&s;ed, would be agree|able. "But, &s;ays Otoo, <HI>Toote</HI> mu&s;t not be in|formed of this, becau&s;e he wanted it, and I re|fu&s;ed to let him have it;" accordingly, he put the gla&s;s into Captain Clerke's hands, a&s;&s;uring him, at the &s;ame time that he came hone&s;tly by Captain Clerke, at fir&s;t wi&s;hed to be excu&s;ed from accepting it; but Otoo in&s;i&s;ted upon it, that he &s;hould; and left it with him. A few days after, he reminded Captain Clerke of the gla&s;s; who, though he did not wi&s;h to have it, was yet
<PB N="12" REF="030274_0454_0FE56F32E5664B88">
de&s;irous o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> obliging Otoo; and thinking, that a few axes would be more acceptable, produced four to give him in exchange. Otoo immediately exclaimed, "<HI>Toote</HI> offered me five for it." "Well (&s;ays Captain Clerke) if that be the ca&s;e, you &s;hall not be the lo&s;er by your friend&s;hip for me; and you &s;hall have &s;ix axes." He readily ac|cepted them; but again de&s;ired, that Captain Cook might not be made acquainted with the tran&s;action. For the many valuable things which Omai had given away, he received one good thing in return. This was a very fine double &s;ailing canoe, completely equipped. Some time before, the Captain had made up a &s;uit of Engli&s;h colours for him; but he con&s;idered them as too valuable to be u&s;ed at this time; and, therefore patched up a parcel of flags and pendants, to the number of ten or a dozen, which he &s;pread on different parts of his canoe. This, as might be expected, drew together a great number of people to look at her. Omai's &s;treamers were a mixture of Engli&s;h, French, Spani&s;h, and Dutch, being all the European colours he had &s;een. He had com|pletely &s;tocked him&s;elf with cloth and cocoa-nut oil, which are better and more plentiful at Ota|heite, than at any of the Society I&s;lands; in&s;o|much, that they are con&s;idered as articles of trade. Omai would not have behaved &s;o incon&s;i&s;tently, as he did in many in&s;tances, had it not been for his &s;i&s;ter and brother-in-law, who, together with
<PB N="13" REF="030274_0455_0FE56EE5277B48D8">
a few &s;elect acquaintances, engro&s;&s;ed him to them|&s;elves, in order to &s;trip him of every article he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. And they would certainly have &s;uc|ceeded, if Captain Cook had not taken the mo&s;t u&s;eful articles of his property in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. This, however, would not have &s;aved Om<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i from ruin, if he had permitted the&s;e relations of his to have accompanied him to his intended place of &s;ettlement at Huaheine. This, indeed was their intention; but the Captain di&s;appointed their far|ther views of plunder, by forbidding them to ap|pear in that i&s;land, while he continued in that part of the world; and they knew him two well not to comply.</P>
<P>Otoo came on board the 28th of September, and informed Captain Cook that he had got a canoe, which he de&s;ired he would take with him as a pre&s;ent from him to the <HI>Eree rahie no Pre|tane.</HI> The Captain was highly plea&s;ed with Otoo, for this mark of his gratitude. At fir&s;t, the Captain &s;uppo&s;ed it to have been a model of one of their ve&s;&s;els of war; but it proved to be a &s;mall <HI>ivahab,</HI> about &s;ixteen feet long. It was double, and probably had been built for the purpo&s;e; and was decorated with carved work, like their canoes in general. It being too large for him to take on board, he could only thank him for his good intention; but he would have been much better plea&s;ed, if his pre&s;ent could have been ac|cepted.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="030274_0456_0FE56F3F5CA98E10">By calms, and gentle breezes from the we&s;t, we were detained here &s;ome days longer than we expected. All this time, the &s;hips were crowded with our friends and &s;urrounded by canoes; for none of them would quit the place, till we de|parted. At length, on the 29th, at three o'clock in the afternoon, the wind came at ea&s;t, and we weighed anchor. The &s;hips being under &s;ail, to oblige Otoo, and to gratify the curio&s;ity of his people, we fired &s;even guns; after which, all our friends, except him, and two or three more, took leave of us with &s;uch lively marks of &s;orrow and affection, as &s;ufficiently te&s;tified how much they regretted our departure. Otoo expre&s;&s;ing a de&s;ire of &s;eeing the &s;hips &s;ail, we made a &s;tretch out to &s;ea, and then in again immediately; when he al&s;o took his la&s;t farewel, and went a&s;hore in his canoe.</P>
<P>It was &s;trictly enjoined to Captain Cook by Otoo, to reque&s;t, in his name, the <HI>Earee rahie no Pretane,</HI> to &s;end him, by the next &s;hip, &s;ome red feathers, and the birds which produce them; al&s;o axes; half a doxen mu&s;kets; powder and &s;hot; and, by no means, to forget hor&s;es.</P>
<P>When the&s;e people make us a pre&s;ent, it is cu&s;tomary for them to let us know what they ex|pect in return; and we find it convenient to gra|tify them; by which means our pre&s;ents come dearer to us than what we get by barter. But, being &s;ometimes pre&s;&s;ed by occa&s;ional &s;carcity, we could have recour&s;e to our friends for a &s;upply
<PB N="15" REF="030274_0457_0FE56F7ED6CAFDD0">
as a pre&s;ent, when we could not get it by any other method. Upon the whole, therefore, this way of traffic was full as advantageous to us as to the natives. Captain Cook, in general, paid for each &s;eparate article as he received it, except in his intercour&s;e with Otoo. His pre&s;ents where &s;o numerous, that no account was kept between him and the Captain. Whatever he a&s;ked for, if it could be &s;pared, the Captain never denied him, and he always found him moderate in his demands.</P>
<P>Captain Cook would not have quited Otaheite &s;o &s;oon as he did, if he could have prevailed upon Omai to fix him&s;elf there. There was not even a probability of our being better &s;upplied with pro|vi&s;ions el&s;ewhere, than we continued to be here, even at the time of our leaving it. Be&s;ides, &s;uch a friend&s;hip and confidence &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between us and the inhabitants, as could hardly be expected at any other place; and it was rather extraordi|nary, had never been once interrupted or &s;u&s;|pended by any accident, or mi&s;under&s;tanding; nor had there been a theft committed, worthy of notice. It is probable, however, that their re|gularity of conduct re&s;ulted from their fear of in|terrupting a traffic, which might procure them a greater &s;hare of our commodities, than they could obtain by plunder or pilfering. This point, in|deed, was, in &s;ome degree, &s;ettled at the fir&s;t in|terview with their chiefs, after our arrival. For
<PB N="16" REF="030274_0458_0FE56EFD86EE71D0">
Captain Cook declared then to the natives, in the mo&s;t deci&s;ive terms, that he would not &s;uffer them to rob us, as they had formerly done. Omai was &s;ingularly u&s;eful in this bu&s;ine&s;s, being in&s;tructed by the Captain to point out to them the happy con&s;equences of their hone&s;t conduct, and the fatal mi&s;chiefs that mu&s;t attend a deviation from it. But the chiefs have it not always in their power to prevent thefts; they are often robbed them&s;elves; and complain of it as the wor&s;t of evils. The mo&s;t valuable things that Otoo re|ceived from Captain Cook, were left in the Cap|tain's po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion till the day hefore we &s;ailed; Otoo declaring, at the &s;ame time, that they were no where &s;o &s;afe. From the acqui&s;ition of new riches, the inducements to pilfering mu&s;t cer|tainly have increa&s;ed; and the chiefs are &s;en&s;ible of this, from their being &s;o extremely de&s;irous of having che&s;ts. The few that the Spaniards left among&s;t them are highly prized; and they were continually a&s;king us for &s;ome. Captain Cook had one made for Otoo, the dimen&s;ions of which were eight feet in length, five in breadth, and about three in depth. Locks and bolts are not con&s;idered as a &s;ufficient &s;ecurity; but mu&s;t be large enough for two people to &s;leep upon, and con&s;equently guard it in the night.</P>
<P>It may appear extraordinary, that we could never get any di&s;tinct account of the time when the Spaniards arrived, the time they &s;tayed, and
<PB N="17" REF="030274_0459_0FE56F7AB4558D70">
when they departed. The more we made enquiry into this matter, the more we were convinced of the incapability of mo&s;t of the&s;e people to remem|ber, calculate, or note the time, when pa&s;t events happened; e&s;pecially if for a longer period than eighteen or twenty months. It however appeared, by the in&s;cription upon the cro&s;s, and by the in|formation of the mo&s;t intelligent of the natives, that two &s;hips came to Oheitepeha in 1774, not long after Captain Cook left Matavai, which was in May the &s;ame year. The live &s;tock they left here, con&s;i&s;ted of one bull, &s;ome goats, hogs, and dogs, and the male of another animal; which we were afterwards informed was a ram, and was, at this time at Bolabola.</P>
<P>The hogs are large; have already much im|proved the breed originally found by us upon the i&s;land; and, on our late arrival, were very nume|rous. Goats are al&s;o in plenty, there being hardly a chief without &s;ome. The dogs that the Spa|niards put a&s;hore are of two or three &s;orts: if they had all been hanged, in&s;tead of being left upon the i&s;land, it would have been better for the natives. Captain Cook's young ram fell a victim to one of the&s;e animals. Four Spaniards remained on &s;hore when the&s;e &s;hips left the i&s;land; two of whom were prie&s;ts, one a &s;ervant, and the other was much care&s;&s;ed among the natives, who di&s;tingui&s;h him by the name of Mateema. He &s;eems to have &s;o far &s;tudied their language, as to
<PB N="18" REF="030274_0460_0FE56EF2AC1216D8">
have been able to &s;peak it tolerably; and to have been indefatigable in impre&s;&s;ing the minds of the i&s;landers with exalted ideas of the greatne&s;s of the Spani&s;h nation, and inducing them to think meanly of that of the Engli&s;h. He even a&s;&s;ured them, that we no longer exi&s;ted as an independent na|tion; that <HI>Prelane</HI> was but a &s;mall i&s;land, which they had entirely de&s;troyed; and as to Captain Cook, that they had met with him at &s;ea, and with the greate&s;t ea&s;e that could be imagined, had &s;ent his &s;hip, and every creature in her, to the bottom; &s;o that his vi&s;iting Otaheite was, at this time, very unexpected. Many other improbable fal&s;ehoods were propagated by this Spaniard, and believed by the inhabitants; but Captain Cook's returning to Otaheite was con&s;idered as a complete confutation of all that Mateema had advanced. With what de&s;ign the prie&s;ts remained, cannot ea&s;ily be conceived. If it was their intention to convert the natives to the Cathalic faith, they certainly have not &s;ucceeded. It does not appear, indeed, that they ever attempted it; for the na|tives &s;ay, they never conver&s;ed with them, either on this, or any other &s;ubject. The prie&s;ts re&s;ided the whole time in the hou&s;e at Oheitepeha; but Mateema roved about continually, vi&s;iting many parts of the i&s;land. After he and his companions had &s;taid ten months, two &s;hips arriving at Oheite|peha, took them aboard, and &s;ailed again in five days. Whatever de&s;ign the Spaniards might have
<PB N="19" REF="030274_0461_0FE56F8C5D058508">
had upon this i&s;land, this ha&s;ty departure &s;hews they have now laid it a&s;ide. They endeavoured to make the natives believe, that they &s;till intend|ed to return; and that they would bring with them hou&s;es, all kinds of animals, and men and women who were to &s;ettle on the i&s;land. Otoo, when he mentioned this to Captain Cook, added, that if the Spaniards &s;hould return, they &s;hould not come to Mataiva Fort, which he &s;aid, was ours. The idea plea&s;ed him; but he did not con&s;ider that the completion of it would deprive him of his kingdom, and his people of their liber|ties. Though this &s;hews how ea&s;ily a &s;ettle|ment might be made at Otaheite, it is, hoped that &s;uch a circum&s;tance will never happen. Our occa&s;ional vi&s;its may have been of &s;ervice to its inhabitants, but (con&s;idering how mo&s;t European e&s;tabli&s;hments are conducted among Indian na|tions) a permanent e&s;tabli&s;hment among&s;t them would, probably, give them ju&s;t cau&s;e to lament that our &s;hips had ever di&s;covered it. Indeed, a mea&s;ure of this kind can hardly ever be &s;eriously thought of; as it can neither an&s;wer the purpo&s;es of public ambition, nor of private avarice.</P>
<P>It has been already ob&s;erved, that Captain Cook received a vi&s;it from one of the two natives of this i&s;land, who had been taken to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ma by the Spaniards. It is &s;omewhat remarkable that he never &s;aw him afterwards, e&s;pecially as the Cap|tain received him with uncommon civility. The
<PB N="20" REF="030274_0462_0FE56FA12ACA3558">
Captain, however, &s;uppo&s;ed that Omai had kept him at a di&s;tance from him, from motives of jea|lou&s;y, he being a traveller, that in &s;ome degree, might vie with him&s;elf. Our touching at Tene|riffe was a lucky circum&s;tance for Omai; who prided him&s;elf in having vi&s;ited a place belonging to Spain, as well as this man. Captain Clerke, who had &s;een the other man, &s;poke of him as a low fellow, a little out of his &s;en&s;es; and his own countrymen entertained the &s;ame opinion of him. In &s;hort, the&s;e two adventurers &s;eemed to be held in little or no e&s;teem. They had not been &s;o fortunate, indeed, as to return home with &s;uch valuable property as had been be&s;towed upon Omai; who&s;e advantages from going to England were &s;o great, that if he &s;hould &s;ink into the &s;ame &s;tate of in&s;ignificance, he has only him&s;elf to blame for it.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>ON the 30th of September, at day-break, after leaving Otaheite, we &s;tood for the north end of the i&s;land of Eimeo. Omai, in his canoe, arrived there before us, and endeavoured, by taking &s;ome nece&s;&s;ary mea&s;ures, to &s;hew us the &s;ituation. We were not, however, without pilots, having &s;everal natives of Otaheite on board, and, among them, not a few women. Unwilling to rely entirely upon the&s;e guides, Captain Cook di&s;patehed two boats to examine the harbour; when, on a &s;ignal being made for &s;afe anchorage, we &s;tood in with both the &s;hips, and anchored in ten fathoms water.</P>
<P>Taloo is the name of this harbour: it is on the north &s;ide of the i&s;land, and in the di&s;trict
<PB N="22" REF="030274_0464_0FE56FA7F2814A70">
of Oboonohoo, or Poonohoo. It runs above two miles between the hills, &s;outh, or &s;outh by ea&s;t. It is not inferior to any harbour that we have met with in this ocean, both for &s;ecurity and good|ne&s;s of bottom. It has al&s;o this &s;ingular advan|tage, that a &s;hip can &s;ail in and out with the reigning trade wind. Several rivers fall into it; one of which is &s;o con&s;iderable, as to admit boats a quarter of a mile up, were the water is per|fectly fre&s;h. The banks, on the &s;ides of this &s;tream, are covered with what the natives call the <HI>pooroo</HI> tree, on which they &s;et no value, as it only &s;erves for firing. So that wood and water may be procured here with great facility.</P>
<P>The harbour of Parowroah, on the &s;ame &s;ide of the i&s;land, is about two miles to the ea&s;tward, and is much larger within than that of Taloo; but the opening in the reef lies to leeward of the harbour, and is con&s;iderably narrower. The&s;e &s;triking defects mu&s;t give the harbour of Taloo a decided preference. There are one or two more harbours on the &s;outh &s;ide of the i&s;land, but they are not &s;o con&s;iderable as tho&s;e we have already mentioned.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as we had anchored, great numbers of the inhabitants came aboard our &s;hips, from mere motives or curio&s;ity, for they brought nothing with them for the purpo&s;es of barter: but &s;everal canoes arrived, the next morning, from more di&s;tant parts, bringing with them an abundant
<PB N="23" REF="030274_0465_0FE56F1890F90820">
&s;upply o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> bread-fruit, cocoa-nuts, and a few hogs, which were exchanged for beads, nails, and hatchets; red feathers not being &s;o much de|manded here as at Otaheite.</P>
<P>On Thur&s;day the 2d of October, in the morn|ing, Captain Cook received a vi&s;it ftom Maheine, the chief of the i&s;land. He approached the &s;hip with as great caution and deliberation, as if he apprehended mi&s;chief from us, as friends of the Otaheiteans; the&s;e people having no idea that we can be in friend&s;hip with any one, without adopting his cau&s;e again&s;t his enemies. This chief was accompanied by his wife, who, we were told, is &s;i&s;ter to Oamo, of Otaheite, who&s;e death we heard of while we remained at this i&s;land. Captain Cook made them pre&s;ents of &s;uch arti|cles as &s;eemed mo&s;t to &s;trike their fancy; and, after &s;taying about half an hour they went on &s;hore. They returned, &s;oon after, with a large hog, meaning it as a return for the Cap|tain's favour; but he made them an additional pre&s;ent to the full value of it; after which they went on board the Di&s;covery, to vi&s;it Captain Clearke.</P>
<P>Maheine, &s;upported with a few adherents, has made him&s;elf, in &s;ome degree, independent of Otaheite. He is between forty and fifty years of age, and is bald-hended; which, at that age, is rather uncommon in the&s;e i&s;lends. He &s;eemed a&s;hamed of &s;hewing his head, and wore a kind
<PB N="24" REF="030274_0466_0FE56F875858D190">
of turban to conceal it. Whether they con&s;ider|ed this deficiency of hair as di&s;graceful, or whe|ther they &s;uppo&s;ed that we con&s;idered it in that light, it is not ea&s;y to determine. The latter, however, appears the mo&s;t probable, from the circum&s;tance of their having &s;een us &s;have the head of one of the natives, whom we detecteed &s;tealing. They naturally concluded, therefore, that this was the kind of puni&s;hment inflicted by us upon all thieves; and &s;ome of our gentlemen, who&s;e heads were but thinly covered with hair, were violently &s;u&s;pected, by them, of being <HI>tetos.</HI></P>
<P>Towards the evening, Captain Cook and Omai mounted on hor&s;eback, and rode along the &s;hore. Omai having forbid the natives to follow us, our train was not very numerous; the fear of giving offence, having got the better of their curio&s;ity. The fleet of Towha had been &s;tationed in this harbour, and though the war was but of &s;hort duration, the marks of its deva&s;tation were every where con&s;picuous. The trees had lo&s;t all their fruit, and the hou&s;es in the neighbourhood had been burnt, or otherwi&s;e de&s;troyed.</P>
<P>Having made every preparation for &s;ailing, we hauled the &s;hip off into the &s;tream, in the morn|ing of the 6th, intending to put to &s;ea the next day, but a di&s;agreeable accident prevented it.</P>
<P>We had, in the day time, &s;ent our goats a&s;hore to graze; and, notwith&s;tanding two men had been appointed to look after them, one of them had
<PB N="25" REF="030274_0467_0FE56F0000DEE298">
been &s;tolen this evening. This was a con&s;iderable lo&s;s, as it interfered with the Captain's views of &s;tocking other i&s;lands with the&s;e animals: he there|fore was determined, if po&s;&s;ible, to recover it. We received intelligence, the next morning, that it had been conveyed to Maheine, who was, at that time, at Parowroah harbour. Two elderly men offered their &s;ervices to conduct any of our people to him, in order to bring back the goat. Accordingly the Captain di&s;patched &s;ome of his people in a boat, charged with a me&s;&s;age to that chief, and in&s;i&s;ted on both the goat and the thief being immediately given up.</P>
<P>Maheine had, only the day before, reque&s;ted the Commodore to give him two goats; but, as he could not &s;pare them, without depriving other i&s;lands, which had none of the&s;e animals, and was informed that there were two already upon this, he refu&s;ed to gratify him. Willing, how|ever, to a&s;&s;i&s;t his views, in this re&s;pect, he de&s;ired an Otaheite chief, then pre&s;ent, to beg Otoo, in his name, to convey two of the&s;e animals to Maheine; and, to induce him to comply with this reque&s;t, &s;ent to Otoo, by the &s;ame chief, a quantity of red feathers, equal in value to the two goats that were required. The Commodore expected that Maheine, and all the other chiefs of the i&s;land, would have been perfectly &s;atisfied with this arrangement; but he was mi&s;taken, as the event clearly proves.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="030274_0468_0FE56F74CC20A510">Little &s;u&s;pecting that any one would pre&s;ume to &s;teal a &s;econd, while the nece&s;&s;ary mea&s;ure were taking to recover the fir&s;t, the goats were again put a&s;hore this morning; and a boat as u&s;ual, was &s;ent for them in the evening. While our people were getting them into the boat, one was conveyed away undi&s;covered. As it was im|mediately mi&s;&s;ed, we expected to recover it with|out much trouble, as it could not have been car|ried to any con&s;iderable di&s;tance. Several of the natives &s;et out, different ways, to &s;eek after it; for they all endeavoured to per&s;uade us, that it mu&s;t have &s;trayed into the woods; not one of them admitting that it was &s;tolen. We were, however, convinced to the contrary, when we perceived that not any of the pur&s;uers returned: their intention was only to amu&s;e us, till their prize was &s;afely depo&s;ited; and night coming on, prevented all future &s;earch. At this in&s;tant, the boat returned with the other goat, and one of the per&s;ons who had &s;tolen it.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t of the inhabitants, the next morning, were moved off, taking with them a corp&s;e, which lay oppo&s;ite the &s;hip, on a <HI>toopapaoo;</HI> and Ma|heine, we were informed, had retired to the re|mote&s;t part of the i&s;land.

female, and with kid: and the Commodore was equally determined to have it back again; he therefore applied to the two elderly men, who had been in&s;trumental in recovering the fir&s;t, who informed him that this had been taken to a place on the &s;outh &s;ide of the i&s;land, called Watea, by Hamoa, who was the chief of that place; but that it would be delivered up if he would &s;end for it. They expre&s;&s;ed a willingne&s;s to conduct &s;ome of his people to the &s;pot; but finding that a boat might go and return in one day, he &s;ent one with two of his officers, Mr. Roberts, and Mr. Shut|tleworth; one to remain with the boat, if &s;he could not get to the place, while the other went with the guides, accompanied by &s;ome of our people. The boat returned late in the evening, when we were informed by the officers, that, after proceeded in the boat as far as rocks and &s;hoals would permit, Mr. Shuttleworth landed; a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> attended with two marines, and one of the guides, proceeding to the hou&s;e of Hamoa, at Watea; where they where, for &s;ome time, amu&s;ed by the people, who pretended they had &s;ent for the goat, and that it would &s;oon be produced. It, however, never arrived; and, night approching, Mr. Shut|tleworth was obliged to return to his boat with|out it.</P>
<P>The Commodore lamented that he had pro|ceeded &s;o far in this bu&s;ine&s;s as he could not re|treat with credit, and without giving encourage|ment
<PB N="28" REF="030274_0470_0FE56F91794E6CE8">
to other i&s;landers to rob us with impunity. Con&s;ulting with Omai, and the two old men, what methods to take, they advi&s;ed him, without he&s;itation, to go into the country with a party of men, and &s;hoot every per&s;on he &s;hould meet with. The Commodore did not approve of this bloody coun&s;el; but, early the next morning, &s;et out with thirty-five of his people, accompanied by Omai, one of the old men, and three or four at|tendants. He al&s;o ordered Lieutenant William|&s;on round the we&s;tern part of the i&s;land, with three armed boats, to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> us.</P>
<P>This party had no &s;ooner landed, than the few remaining natives fled before us. The fir&s;t per|&s;on we met with upon our march, was in a kind of perilous &s;ituation; for Omai, the in&s;tant he beheld him, a&s;ked Captain Cook if he &s;hould &s;hoot him; &s;o fully was he per&s;uaded, that the advice he had given, was immediately to be car|ried into execution. The Commodore then gave orders, both to him and our guide, to let it be made known, that it was not our intention to in|jure, much le&s;s to de&s;troy, a &s;ingle native. The&s;e joyful tidings &s;oon circulated, and prevented the flight of the inhabitants.</P>
<P>A&s;cending the ridge of hills, on our road to Watea, we were informed that the goat had been carried the &s;ame way, and could hardly have pa&s;&s;ed the hills: we therefore marched up in great &s;ilence, expecting to &s;urprize the party who
<PB N="29" REF="030274_0471_0FE56F52DE6A1648">
were bearing off the prize; but, when we arrived at the uppermo&s;t plantation, we were told, that the animal we were in &s;earch of, had, indeed, been kept there the fir&s;t night, but had been car|ried to Watea the next morning. We made no further enquiry, till we came within &s;ight of Wa|tea, where we were directed to Hamoa's hou&s;e, by &s;ome people who al&s;o informed us, that the goat was there. We therefore fully expected to obtain it on our arrival; but, when we reached the hou&s;e, the people we &s;aw there, denied that they had ever &s;een it, or knew any thing concern|ing it. Hamoa, him&s;elf appeared, and expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to the &s;ame effect.</P>
<P>On our fir&s;t coming to Watea, &s;everal men were &s;een, running to and fro in the woods, with clubs and darts in their hands; and Omai, who ran towards them, had &s;tones thrown at him. Hence it appeared, that they intended to oppo&s;e any attempt that we might be induced to make, but on &s;eeing the &s;trength of our party, had given up the de&s;ign. We were confirmed in this opi|nion, by ob&s;erving, that all their hou&s;es were empty.</P>
<P>After collecting, a few of the natives together, Omai was directed to expo&s;tulate with them on the ab&s;urdity of their conduct, and tell them that we had received &s;ufficient evidence that the goat was in their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; and that, if it was not immediately delivered up, we &s;hould burn
<PB N="30" REF="030274_0472_0FE56FA97A52C170">
all their hou&s;es and canoes; but, notwith&s;tand|ing this expo&s;tulation, they per&s;i&s;ted in their de|nial of having any knowledge of it, In con&s;e|quence of which, the Commodore &s;et fire to &s;ix or eight of their hou&s;es, and two or three war canoes, which were pre&s;ently con&s;umed. After this we marched off to join the boats, which were, at that time, about &s;even or eight miles from us; and, in our road, burnt &s;ix other war canoes, without any oppo&s;ition. On the contrary, many of the natives a&s;&s;i&s;ted us; more, perhaps, from fear, than any other motive. At length Omai, who was at &s;ome di&s;tance before us, came back with information, that a multitude of men were a&s;&s;embling to attack us. We prepared our&s;elves to receive them, but, in&s;tead of enemies, they were petitioners, with plantain-trees in their hands, which they laid down before us, entreating the Commodore to &s;pare a canoe that lay upon the &s;pot, which he readily complied with.</P>
<P>About four o'clock in the afternoon, we ar|rived at Wharrarade, where our boats were wait|ing for us. The di&s;trict of Wharrarade belongs to Tiaratoboonoue; but this chief together with the other principal people of the place, had fled to the hills; though we made no attack upon their property, they being in amity with Otoo. Here we remained about an hour, in order to re&s;t our|&s;elves, and afterwards &s;et out for the &s;hips, where we arrived at eight o'clock in the evening; but
<PB N="31" REF="030274_0473_0FE56F6C01F042F8">
no tidings of the goat had, at that time, been received; and, of cour&s;e, the operations of the day had been ineffectual.</P>
<P>Early on Friday morning, the 10th of Octo|ber, the Captain di&s;patched one of Omai's men to Maheine, charged with this peremptory me&s;|&s;age, that if he per&s;i&s;ted in his refu&s;al to deliver up the goat, a &s;ingle canoe &s;hould not be left upon the i&s;land; and that ho&s;tilities &s;hould never cea&s;e, while the &s;tolen animal continued in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. That the me&s;&s;enger might perceive that the Commodore was in earne&s;t, he ordered the carpenter, in his pre&s;ence, to break up three or four canoes, that lay at the head of the har|bour. The planks where, by his direction, taken on board, to &s;erve as materials for building a hou&s;e for Omai, at the place where he intended to re&s;ide. The Commodore, properly attended, went afterwards to the next harbour, where he de&s;troyed &s;even or eight more canoes, and re|turned on board about &s;even in the evening. On his arrival, he was informed, that the goat had been returned about half an hour before; and it appeared, from good intelligence, that it came from the very place, where the inhabitants, the day before, declared they knew nothing about it. But from the me&s;&s;age delivered to the chief in the morning, he perceived that the Commodore was not to be trifled with.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="030274_0474_0FE56F70EB96BCB8">Thus ended this trouble&s;ome and unfortunate bu&s;ine&s;s; equally to be regretted by the natives, and by Captain Cook. He was grieved to re|flect, that, after refu&s;ing to a&s;&s;i&s;t his friends at Otaheite, in the inva&s;ion of this i&s;land, he &s;hould &s;o &s;oon be obliged to engage in ho&s;tilities again&s;t its inhabitants; which, perhaps, were more in|jurious to them, than Towha's expedition.</P>
<P>Our intercour&s;e with the natives was renewed the next morning; &s;everal canoes bringing bread-fruit and cocoa-nuts to the &s;hips to barter; whence it was natural to conclude, that they were con&s;cious they had merited the treatment they had received; and that, the cau&s;e of Captain Cook's di&s;plea&s;ure being now removed, they apprehend|ed no further mi&s;chief. We weighed, with a breeze, down the harbour, about nine; but it was &s;o faint and variable, that we did not get out to &s;ea till noon, when we &s;teered for Hua|heine, Omai attending in his canoe.</P>
<P>At Eimeo, the &s;hips were abundantly &s;upplied with fire-wood. We did not &s;upply our&s;elves with this article at Otaheite, as there is not a tree at Matavai but what is u&s;eful to the inhabitants. We al&s;o received here a large &s;upply of refre&s;h|ments in hogs, bread-fruit, and coco-nuts.</P>
<P>There is very little difference between the pro|duce of this i&s;land, and that of Otaheite; but the difference in their woman is remarkable.

<P>The appearance of Eimeo bears not the lea&s;t re&s;emblance to that of Otaheite. The latter be|ing a hilly country, has little low land, except &s;ome deep vallies, and the flat border that almo&s;t &s;urrounds it near the &s;ea. Eimeo has &s;teep rug|ged hills, running in different directions, leaving large vallies, and gently ri&s;ing grounds about their &s;ides. The hills, though rocky, are gene|rally covered with trees, almo&s;t to the tops. At the bottom of the harbour of Taloo, the ground gradually ri&s;es to the foot of the hills; but the flat border, on the &s;ides becomes quite &s;teep at a &s;mall di&s;tance from the &s;ea. This renders it a pro&s;pect &s;uperior to any thing we &s;aw at Otaheite.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>ON the morning that &s;ucceeded our depar|ture from Eimeo, we &s;aw Huaheine ex|tending from &s;outh-we&s;t by we&s;t, to we&s;t by north. At twelve o'clock we anchored at the northern entrance of Owharre harbour, &s;ituated on the we&s;t &s;ide of the i&s;land. Omai, in his canoe, entered the harbour ju&s;t before us, but did not land. Though many of his countrymen crowd|ed to &s;ee him, he did not take much notice of them. Great numbers al&s;o came off to the &s;hips, in&s;omuch that we were greatly incommoded by them. Our pa&s;&s;engers immediately informed them of our tran&s;actions at Eimeo, multiplying, by ten at lea&s;t, the number of hou&s;es and canoes
<PB N="35" REF="030274_0478_0FE56FB19B833680">
that we had de&s;troyed. Captain Cook was not much di&s;plea&s;ed at their giving this exaggerated account, as he found that it made a con&s;iderable impre&s;&s;ion upon all who heard it; &s;o that he had hopes it would induce the natives of this i&s;land to treat him in a better manner than they had done in his prior vi&s;its.</P>
<P>The next morning, which was the 13th of Oc|tober, all the principal people of the i&s;land came to our &s;hips. This was ju&s;t what the Commodore wi&s;hed, as it was now high time to &s;ettle Omai; and he &s;uppo&s;ed, that the pre&s;ence of the&s;e chiefs would enable him to effect it in a &s;atisfactory man|ner. Omai now &s;eemed inclined to e&s;tabli&s;h him|&s;elf at Ulietea; and if he and Captain Cook could have agreed with re&s;pect to the mode of accompli&s;hing that de&s;ign, the latter would have con&s;ented to adopt it. H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> father had been de|prived by the inhabitants of Bolabola, when they &s;ubdued Ulietea, of &s;ome land in that i&s;land; and the Captain hoped he &s;hould be able to get it re&s;tored to the &s;on without difficulty. For this purpo&s;e, it was nece&s;&s;ary that Omai &s;hould be upon amicable terms with tho&s;e who had be|come ma&s;ters of the i&s;land; but he would not li&s;ten to any &s;uch propo&s;al, and was vain enough to imagine, that the Captain would make u&s;e of force to re-in&s;tate him in his forfeited lands. This preventing his being fixed at Ulietea, the Captain began to con&s;ider Huaheine as the more
<PB N="36" REF="030274_0479_0FE56FB322BBB558">
proper place; and therefore determined to avail him&s;elf of the pre&s;ence of the chief men of that i&s;land, and, propo&s;e the affair to them.</P>
<P>The Captain now prepared to make a formal vi&s;it to Taireetareea, the <HI>Earee rahie,</HI> or king of the i&s;land, with a view of introducing this bu&s;i|ne&s;s. Omai, who was to accompany him, dre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf very properly on the occa&s;ion, and pro|vided a hand&s;ome pre&s;ent for the chief him&s;elf, and another for his <HI>Eatooa.</HI> Their landing drew mo&s;t of the vi&s;itors from our &s;hips, who, with many others, a&s;&s;embled in a large hou&s;e. The concour&s;e of people became very great, the major part of whom &s;eemed &s;touter and fairer than tho&s;e of Otaheite, and the number of men who appear|ed to be of con&s;equence was al&s;o much greater, in proportion to the extent of the i&s;land. The Captain waited &s;ome time for Taireetareea: but when the chief appeared, he found that his pre|&s;ence might ea&s;ily have been di&s;pen&s;ed with, as he did not exceed ten years of age. Omai began with making his offering to the gods, which con&s;i&s;ted of cloth, red feathers &amp;c. Another offering &s;ucceeded, which was to be given to the gods by the young chief; and, after that, &s;e|veral other tufts of red feathers were pre&s;ented. The different articles were laid before a prie&s;t, being each of them delivered with a kind of prayer, which was &s;poken by one of Omai's friends, though in a great mea&s;ure dictated by him&s;elf,
<PB N="37" REF="030274_0480_0FE56FB5046AD048">
In the&s;e prayers he did not forget his friends in England, nor tho&s;e who had conducted him &s;afe back to his native country. The <HI>Earee rahie no Pretane</HI> (king of Great-Britain), the Earl of Sand|wich, <HI>Toote, Tatee,</HI> (Cook and Clerke) were men|tioned in every one of them. The&s;e offerings and prayers being ended, the prie&s;t took each of the articles in order, and after repeating a prayer, &s;ent every one to the <HI>morai.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e religious rites having been performed, Omai &s;eated him&s;elf by the Captain, who be|&s;towed a pre&s;ent on the young chief, and receiv|ed another in return. Some arrangements were next agreed upon, relative to the mode of carry|ing on the intercour&s;e between us and the i&s;landers; and the Captain painted out the mi&s;chievous con|&s;equences that would attend their plundering us, as they had done on former occa&s;ions. The e&s;ta|bli&s;hment of Omai was then propo&s;ed to the chiefs who were a&s;&s;embled. He informed then, that we had conveyed him into our country, where he was well received by the great King and his <HI>Earees,</HI> (chiefs or nobles) and treated during his whole &s;tay with all the marks of regard and affection; that he had been brought back again, after hav|ing been enriched, by our genero&s;ity, with a va|riety of articles, which would be highly benefi|cial to his countrymen; and that, be&s;ides the two hor&s;es which were to continue with him, many other new and u&s;eful animals had been left at
<PB N="38" REF="030274_0481_0FE56FB8F6DD8070">
Otaheite, which would &s;peedily multiply, and furni&s;h a &s;ufficient number for the u&s;e of all the neighbouring i&s;lands. He then gave them to un|der&s;tand, that it was Captain Cook's earne&s;t re|que&s;t, that they would give his friend a piece of land, upon which he might build a hou&s;e, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ai&s;e provi&s;ions for him&s;elf and &s;ervants: adding, that, if he could not obtain this at Huaheine either by donation or purcha&s;e, the Captain was re&s;olved to carry him to Ulietea, and e&s;tabli&s;h him there. The&s;e topics were dictated to Omai by Captain Cook, who ob&s;erved, that what he concluded with, about going to Ulietea, &s;eemed to gain the approbation of all the chiefs; and he immediately perceived the rea&s;on. Omai had vainly flattered him&s;elf, that the Captain would u&s;e force in re&s;toring him to his father's lands in Ulietea, and he had talked at random, on this &s;ubject, to &s;ome of the a&s;&s;embly; who now ex|pected that the Captain would a&s;&s;i&s;t them in in|vading Ulietea, and driving the Bolabolans out of that i&s;land. It being proper, therefore, that he &s;hould undeceive them, he &s;ignified in the mo&s;t deci&s;ive manner, that he would neither give them any a&s;&s;i&s;tance in &s;uch an enterprize, nor would even &s;uffer it to be put in execution, while he remained in their &s;eas; and that, if Omai e&s;ta|bli&s;hed him&s;elf in Ulietea, he ought to be intro|duced as a friend, and not forced upon the peo|ple of Bolabola as their conqueror.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="030274_0482_0FE56F9335B7DC90">This preremptory declaraion immediately gave a new turn to the &s;entiments of the council; one of whom expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to this effect: that, the whole i&s;land of Huaheine, and whatever it, contained, were Captain Cook's; and that, con&s;e|quently, he might di&s;po&s;e of what portion he, plea&s;ed to his friend. Omai was plea&s;ed a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> hear|ing this; thinking that he would be very liberal, and give him what was perfectly &s;ufficient. But to make an offer of what it would have been im|proper to accept, the Captain con&s;idered as of|fering nothing; and therefore de&s;ired, that they would mark out the particular &s;pot, and likewi&s;e the exact quantity of land, which they intended to allot for the &s;ettlement. Upon this, &s;ome chiefs, who had already retired from the a&s;&s;embly, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">re &s;ent for; and, after a &s;hort con&s;ultation, the Commodore's reque&s;t was unanimou&s;ly grant|ed, and the ground immediately fixed upon, ad|joining to the hou&s;e where the pre&s;ent meeting was held. It extended along the &s;hore of the harbour, about two hundred yards; its depth to the bottom of the hill was &s;omewhat more; and a proportional part of the hill was comprehended in the grant. This affair being &s;ettled, a tent was pitched on &s;hore, a po&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hed, and the ob&s;ervatories erected. The carpenters of each &s;hip were al&s;o now enployed in building a &s;mall hou&s;e for Omai, in which he might &s;ecure the various European commodities that he had in his
<PB N="40" REF="030274_0483_0FE56F7D4E228BA8">
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; at the &s;ame time, &s;ome of our people were occupied in making a garden for his u&s;e, planting vines, &s;haddocks, melons, pine apples, and the &s;eeds of other vegetable articles; all which were in a flouri&s;hing &s;tate before our de|parture from the i&s;land.</P>
<P>Omai began now to pay a &s;erious attention to his own affairs, and heartily repented of his ill|judged prodigality at Otaheite. He found at Huaheine, a brother, a &s;i&s;ter, and a brother-in-law, the &s;i&s;ter having been married. But the&s;e did not plunder him, as his other relations had lately done. It appeared, however, that though they had too much hone&s;ty and good-nature to do him any injury, they were of too little con&s;e|quen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e in the i&s;land to do him any real &s;ervi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">es, having neither authority nor influence to protect his property o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> his per&s;on. Thus circum&s;tanced, he ran a great ri&s;que of being &s;tripped of every thing he had received from us, as &s;oon as he &s;hould cea&s;e to be within the reach of our power|ful protection.</P>
<P>He was now upon the point of being placed in the very &s;ingular &s;ituation, of being the only rich man in the community of which he was to be a member. And as he had, by his connection with us, made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of an accumulated quan|tity of a &s;pecies of trea&s;ure which his countrymen could not create by any art or indu&s;try of their own, it was natural to imagine, that while all
<PB N="41" REF="030274_0484_0FE56FBADF04DF48">
were de&s;irous of &s;haring in this envied wealth, all would be ready to join in attempts to &s;trip its &s;ole proprietor. As the mo&s;t likely means of pre|venting this, Captain Cook advi&s;ed him to di&s;|tribute &s;ome of his moveables among two or three of the principal chiefs; who, on being thus gra|tified them&s;elves, might be induced to favour him with their patronage, and &s;hield him from the injuries of others. He promi&s;ed to follow this advice; and we heard, before we &s;ailed, that this prudent &s;tep had been taken. The Captain, however, not confiding entirely in the operations of gratitude, had recour&s;e to the more forcible and effectual motive of intimidation, taking every opportunity of notifying to the inhabitants, that it was his intention to make another vi&s;it to their i&s;land, after being ab&s;ent the u&s;ual time; and that, if he did not find his friend in the &s;ame &s;tate of &s;ecurity in which he &s;hould leave him at pre|&s;ent, all tho&s;e who &s;hould then appear to have been his enemies, might expect to become the objects of his re&s;entment. This menacing decla|ration will, probably, have &s;ome effect; for our &s;ucce&s;&s;ive vi&s;its of late years have induced the&s;e i&s;landers to believe, that our &s;hips are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o return at certain periods, and while they continue to entertain &s;uch a notion, which the Captain thought it a fair &s;tratagem to confirm, Omai has &s;ome pro&s;pect of being &s;uffered to thrive upon his new plantation.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="030274_0485_0FE56FBC644B90A0">While we remained in this harbour, we carried the bread on &s;hore to clear it of vermin. The number of cock-roaches that infe&s;ted the &s;hip at this time, is almo&s;t incredible. The damage we &s;u&s;tained from them was very con&s;iderable; and every attempt to de&s;troy them proved fruitle&s;s. If any kind of food was expo&s;ed for a few minutes, it was covered with the&s;e noxious in&s;ects, who &s;oon pierced it full of holes, &s;o that it re&s;embled an honey-comb. They proved particularly de|&s;tructive to birds, which had been &s;tuffed for cu|rio&s;ities, and were &s;o fond of ink, that they eat out the writing on the labels, fa&s;tened to different articles, and the only thing that pre&s;erved books from their ravages, was the clo&s;ene&s;s of the bind|ing, which prevented the&s;e devourers from in&s;i|nuating them&s;elves between the leaves. Accord|ing to Mr. Ander&s;on, they were of two &s;orts, the <HI>blatta orientalis,</HI> and <HI>germanica.</HI></P>
<P>The intercour&s;e of trade and friendly offices, between us and the inhabitants of Huaheine, was undi&s;turbed, by any accident, till the evening of the 22d, when one of the natives found means to get into Mr. Bayly's ob&s;ervatory, and carry off a &s;extent, unob&s;erved. Captain Cook was no &s;ooner informed of this theft than he went a&s;hore, and de&s;ired Omai to apply to the chiefs, to pro|cure re&s;titution. He accordingly made applica|tion to them, but they took no &s;teps towards re|covering the in&s;trument, being more attentive to
<PB N="43" REF="030274_0486_0FE56FBE4B24D820">
a <HI>heeva,</HI> that was then exhibiting, till the Cap|tain ordered the performers to de&s;it. Being now convinced that he was in earne&s;t, they began to make &s;ome enquiry after the delinquent, who was &s;itting in the mid&s;t of them, with &s;uch marks of unconcern, that the Captain was in great doubt of his being guilty, particularly as he denied it. Omai, however, a&s;&s;uring him that this was the per&s;on, he was &s;ent on board the &s;hip and there confined. This rai&s;ed an&punc; univer&s;al ferment among the a&s;&s;embled i&s;landers, and the whole body fled with precipitation. The pri&s;oner being examined by Omai, was with &s;ome difficulty brought to confe&s;s where he had concealed the &s;extent, and it was brought back, unhurt, the next morning. After this, the natives recovered from their con|&s;ternation, and began to gather about us as u&s;ual. As the thief appeared to be a &s;hamele&s;s villain, Captain Cook puni&s;hed him with greater &s;everity than he had ever done any former culprit. Be|&s;ides having his head and beard &s;haved, he com|manded that both his ears &s;hould be cut off, and then di&s;mi&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>This puni&s;hment, however, did not deter him from committing other offences; for early in the morning of the 25th, a general alarm was &s;pread occa&s;ioned, as was reported, by one of our goats being &s;tolen by this very man; and though, upon examination, we found every thing &s;afe in that quarter, yet it appeared, that he had de&s;troyed
<PB N="44" REF="030274_0487_0FE56FC503BA8760">
and carried off from Omai's ground, &s;everal vines and cabbage-plants; and he publicly threat|ened to put him to death, and &s;et fire to his hou&s;e as &s;oon as we &s;hould quit this place. To pre|vent his doing any further mi&s;chief, the Captain ordered him to be &s;eized, and confined again on board the &s;hip, with a view of carrying him off the i&s;land; and this intention &s;eemed to give ge|neral &s;atisfaction to all the chiefs. He was a na|tive of Bolabola: but there were two many of the people here ready to co-operate with him in all his de&s;igns. We had, indeed, always met with more trouble&s;ome per&s;ons in Huaheine than in any other of the adjacent i&s;lands; and it was only fear and the want of proper opportunities, that induced them to behave better now. Anarchy and confu&s;ion &s;eemed to prevail among them. Their <HI>Earce rahie,</HI> as we have already ob&s;erved, was but a child; and we did not find, that there was any individual, or any &s;et of men, who held the reins of government for him; &s;o that, when|ever any mi&s;under&s;tanding occured between us, we never knew, with &s;ufficient preci&s;ion, to whom it was nece&s;&s;ary to apply, in order to effect an accommodation, or procure redre&s;s.</P>
<P>Omai's hou&s;e being now almo&s;t fini&s;hed, many of his moveables were carried a&s;hore on the 26th; among&s;t other articles was a box of toys, which greatly plea&s;ed the gazing multitude. But, as to his plates, di&s;hes, drinking mugs, gla&s;&s;es,
<PB N="45" REF="030274_0488_0FE56FC68D001448">
pots, kettles, and the whole train of dome&s;tic ap|paratus, &s;carce one of his countrymen would even look at them. Omai, him&s;elf began to think that they would be of no &s;ervice to him; that a baked hog was more &s;avory eating than a boiled one; that a plantain leaf made as good a plate or di&s;h as pewter; and that a cocoa-nut &s;hell was as convenient a goblet as one of our mugs. He therefore di&s;po&s;ed of mo&s;t of the&s;e articles of Engli&s;h furniture among the crew of our &s;hips; and received from them, in return, hatchets, and other iron implements, which had a more intrin&s;ic value in this part of the world. Among the nu|merous pre&s;ents be&s;towed upon him in England, fireworks had not been omitted; &s;ome of which we exhibited in the evening of the 28th, before a great multitude of people, who beheld them with a mixture of plea&s;ure and apprehen&s;ion. Tho&s;e which remained were put in order, and left with Omai, pur&s;uant to their original de&s;ti|nation.</P>
<P>On Thur&s;day the 30th, early in the morning, the Bolabola-man whom we had in confinement, found means to e&s;cape out of the &s;hip, carrying with him the &s;hackle of the bilboo-bolt that had been put about his leg, which was taken from him as &s;oon as he arrived on &s;hore, by one of the chiefs, and given to Omai; who quickly came on board, to inform the Captain that his mortal enemy was again let loo&s;e upon him.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="030274_0489_0FE548AD1A1FCA38">We found, upon enquiry, that the &s;entry placed over the pri&s;oner, and even the whole watch in that part of the &s;hip where he was confined, having fallen a&s;leep, he &s;eized the favourable op|portunity, took the key of the irons out of the drawer into which he had &s;een it put, and &s;et him|&s;elf at liberty. This e&s;cape convinced the Com|modore, that his people had been very remi&s;s in their neight-duty; which rendered it nece&s;&s;ary to cha&s;tize tho&s;e who were now in fault, and to e&s;|tabli&s;h &s;ome new regulations that might prevent &s;imilar negligence in future. He was plea&s;ed at hearing, afterwards, that the fellow who had e&s;|caped, had gone over to Ulietea.</P>
<P>Omai was no &s;ooner &s;ettled in his new habi|tation, than Captain Cook began to think of de|parting from Huaheine, and got every thing off from the &s;hore this evening, except a goat big with kid, and a hor&s;e and mare; which were le&s;t in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of our friend, who was now to be finally &s;eparated from us. We al&s;o gave him a boar and two &s;ows of the Engli&s;h breed; and he had got two or three &s;ows of his own. The hor&s;e had covered the mare during our continu|ance at Otaheite; &s;o that the introduction of a breed of hor&s;es into the&s;e i&s;lands&punc; has probably &s;ucceeded, by this valuable pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>With regard to Omai's dome&s;tic e&s;tabli&s;hment, he had procured at Otaheite, four or five <HI>toulous,</HI> or people of the lower cla&s;s; the two young New-Zealanders
<PB N="47" REF="030274_0490_0FE56FC9B870F980">
remained with him; and his Bro|ther, and &s;everal others, joined him at Hau|heine; &s;o that his family now con&s;i&s;ted of ten or eleven per&s;ons; if that can ju&s;tly be denominat|ed a family, to which not one female belonged. The hou&s;e which our people erected for him was twenty-four feet by eighteen; and about ten feet in height. It was compo&s;ed of boards which were the &s;poils of our military ob&s;ervations at Ei|meo; and, in the con&s;truction of it, as few nails as po&s;&s;ible were u&s;ed, le&s;t there might be an in|ducement, from the de&s;ire of iron, to pull it down. It was agreed upon, that, immediately after our departure, he &s;hould erect a &s;pacious hou&s;e after the mode of his own country; one end of which was to be brought over that which we had built, &s;o as entirely to enclo&s;e it for greater &s;ecurity. In this work, &s;ome of the chiefs of the i&s;land promi&s;ed to contribute their a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance; and if the intended building &s;hould cover the ground which was marked out for it, few of the hou&s;es in Huaheine will exceed it in magni|tude.</P>
<P>Omai's European weapons con&s;i&s;ted of a &s;owl|ing-piece, two pair of pi&s;tols, &s;everal &s;words or cutla&s;&s;es, a mu&s;quet, bayonet, and a cartouch-box. After he had got on &s;hore whatever ap|pertained to him, he had the two Captains, and mo&s;t of the officers of both our &s;hips, two or three times, to dinner; on which occa&s;ions, his
<PB N="48" REF="030274_0491_0FE56F94C1B076F0">
table was plentifully &s;upplied with the be&s;t provi|&s;ions that the i&s;land could afford. Before we &s;et &s;ail, the Commodore cau&s;ed the following in&s;crip|tion to be cut upon the out&s;ide of his hou&s;e:

<P>On Sunday, the 2d of November, at four o'clock, we took the advantage of an ea&s;ter|ly breeze, and &s;ailed out of Owharre harbour. Mo&s;t of our friends continued on board till our ve&s;&s;els were under &s;ail; when Captain Cook, to gratify their curio&s;ity, ordered five guns to be fired. Then they all left us, except Omai, who remained till we were out at &s;ea. We had come to &s;ail by a haw&s;er fa&s;tened to the &s;hore, which, in ca&s;ting the &s;hip, parted, being cut by the rocks, and its outer end was left behind: it therefore became nece&s;&s;ary to di&s;patch a boat to bring it on board. In this boat, our friend Omai went a&s;hore, after having taken a very affectionate fare|wel of all the officers. He &s;u&s;tained this part|ing with a manly fortitude, till he came to Cap|tain Cook, when, notwith&s;tanding all his efforts, he was unable to &s;uppre&s;s his tears; and he wept all the time in going a&s;hore, as Mr. King, who accompanied him in the boat, afterwards inform|ed the Captain.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="030274_0492_0FE56FCFA9955AF0">Though we had now, to our great &s;atisfaction, brought him &s;afe back to the very &s;pot from which he was taken, it is probable, that we left him in a &s;ituation le&s;s de&s;irable than that which he was in before his connection with us: not that, having ta&s;ted the comforts of civilized life, he mu&s;t become, more wretched from being obliged to relinqui&s;h all thoughts of continuing them, but merely becau&s;e the advantages he received from us, have placed him in a more hazardous &s;ituation, with re&s;pect to his per&s;onal &s;afety. From being greatly care&s;&s;ed in England, he had lo&s;t &s;ight of his primary condition, and did not con&s;ider in what manner his acqui&s;itions, either of knowledge or of wealth, would be e&s;timated by his country|men, at his return; which were the only things whereby he could recommend him&s;elf to them now, more than before, and on which he could lay the foundation either of his future happine&s;s or greatne&s;s. He appeared to have, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, forgotten their cu&s;toms in this re&s;pect, and even to have mi&s;taken their genius; otherwi&s;e he mu&s;t have been convinced of the extreme difficulty there would be in getting him&s;elf admitted as a man of rank, where there is &s;carce a &s;ingle in&s;tance of a per&s;on's being rai&s;ed from an inferior &s;tation even by the greate&s;t merit. Rank &s;eems to be the foundation of all power and di&s;tinction here, and is &s;o pertinaciou&s;ly adhered to, that, unle&s;s a per|&s;on
<PB N="50" REF="030274_0493_0FE56F88F9246B00">
has &s;ome degree of it, he will be contemn|ed and hated, if he pretends to exerci&s;e any au|thority. This was really the ca&s;e, in a great mea&s;ure, with Omai; though his countrymen were rather cautious of expre&s;&s;ing their &s;enti|ments while we continued among them.</P>
<P>If he had made a proper u&s;e of the pre&s;ents he brought with him from Great-Britain, this, with the knowledge he had gained by travelling, might have enabled him to form the mo&s;t ad|vantageous connections. But he exhibited too many proofs of a weak inattention to this ob|vious means of promoting his intere&s;t. He had formed &s;chemes of a higher nature; it may in|deed be &s;aid, meaner; for revenge, rather than a de&s;ire of greatne&s;s, appeared to influence him from the beginning. His father was, cer|tainly, a man of con&s;iderable property in Ulie|tea, when that i&s;land was &s;ubdued by the inha|bitants of Bolabola; and, with many others, fled for refuge to Huaheine, where he died, and left Omai, with &s;everal other children, who thus became entirely dependent, In this &s;ituation, Captain Furneaux took him up, and brought him to England. Whether he expected, from the treatment he there met with, that any a&s;&s;i&s;tance would be afforded him again&s;t the enemies of his father and his country, or whether he had the vanity to &s;uppo&s;e, that his own &s;uperiority of knowledge, and per&s;onal courage, would be &s;uf|ficient
<PB N="51" REF="030274_0494_0FE56F45FB56D390">
to di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s the conquerors of Ulietea, is uncertain; but, from the very commencement of the voyage, this was his con&s;tant topic. He would not pay any attention to our remon&s;trances on &s;uch an incon&s;iderate determinaton, but was di&s;plea&s;ed, whenever more rea&s;onable coun&s;els were propo&s;ed for his benefit. Nay, he was &s;o ri|diculou&s;ly attached to his favourite &s;cheme, that he affected to believe the Bolabolans would ce|tainly quit the conquered i&s;land, as &s;oon as they &s;hould have intelligence of his arrival in Otaheite. As we proceeded, however, on our voyage, he began to perceive his error; and, by the time of our arrival at the Friendly I&s;lands, had &s;uch ap|prehen&s;ions of his reception in his own country, that he was inclined to have remained at Ton|gataboo, under the protection of his friend Fee|nou. At the&s;e i&s;lands, he &s;quandered away a con&s;iderable part of his European trea&s;ure; and he was equally imprudent at Otaheite, till Cap|tain Cook put a &s;top to his profu&s;ion. He al&s;o formed &s;uch improper connections there, that Otoo, though at fir&s;t di&s;po&s;ed to countenance him, afterwards openly expre&s;&s;ed his di&s;appro|bation of his conduct. He might, however, have recovered the favour of that chief, and have &s;et|tled, to great advantage, in Otaheite, as he had formely lived &s;ome years there, and was now honoured with the notice of Towha, who&s;e va|luable pre&s;ent of a large double canoe has been
<PB N="52" REF="030274_0495_0FE56F346B738518">
already mentioned. But he continued undeter|mined to the la&s;t, and probably would not have adopted the plan of &s;ettlement in Huaheine, if Captain Cook had not &s;o po&s;itively refu&s;ed to employ force in re&s;toring him to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his father's property.</P>
<P>Omai's greate&s;t danger, in his pre&s;ent &s;ituation, will ari&s;e from the very imprudent declarations of his antipathy to the Bolabolans. For the&s;e people, from the motives of jealou&s;y, will undoubt|edly endeavour to render him obnoxious to the inhabitants of Huaheine; as they are now at peace with that i&s;land, and may ea&s;ily accompli&s;h their de&s;igns. This circum&s;tance, he might, with great ea&s;e, have avoided. For they were not only free from any aver&s;ion to him, but the chief, whom we mentionned before, as a prie&s;t or god, even offered to rein&s;tate him in his father's lands. But he peremptorily refu&s;ed this; and, to the very la&s;t, continued fixed in this re&s;olution to em|brace the fir&s;t opportunity of &s;atisfying his re|venge in battle. To this he is perhaps not a lit|tle &s;timulated by the coat of mail he brought from England; clothed in which, and furni&s;hed with fire-arms, he idly imagines that he &s;hall be invincible.</P>
<P>The defects of Omai's character were con&s;i|derably over-balanced by his great good-nature, and docile, tractable di&s;po&s;iton. Captain Cook, during the whole time he was with him, &s;eldom
<PB N="53" REF="030274_0496_0FE56F5EA665AA88">
had rea&s;on to be &s;eriou&s;ly di&s;plea&s;ed with his ge|neral conduct. His grateful heart ever retained the highe&s;t &s;en&s;e of the favours conferred on him in England; nor will he ever be unmindful of tho&s;e who honoured him, while in that kingdom, with their friend&s;hip and protection. Though he had a tolerable &s;hare of under&s;tanding, he &s;hewed little application and per&s;everance in ex|erting it, &s;o that he had but a general and im|perfect knowledge of things. He was not a man of any great degree of ob&s;ervation. There were many elegant amu&s;ements, as well as u&s;eful arts, among the Friendly I&s;landers, which he might have conveyed to his native country, where they, in all probability, would have been readily adopt|ed. But we never found that he endeavoured to make him&s;elf ma&s;ter of any one of them. Such indifference is, indeed, the characteri&s;tic foible of his countrymen. Though they have been vi&s;ited by Europeans, at times, for the&s;e ten years pa&s;t, we could not di&s;cern the &s;lighte&s;t ve&s;tige of any attempt to profit by this intercour&s;e; nor have they hitherto imitated us in any re&s;pect. It mu&s;t not, therefore, be expected, that Omai will be able to introduce among them many of our arts and cu&s;toms, or much improve tho&s;e to which they have been familiarized by long habit. We tru&s;t, however, that he will exert his endeavours to bring to perfection the va|rious fruits and vegetables that were planted by
<PB N="54" REF="030274_0497_0FE56F31028DDAB8">
us; which will be no &s;mall acqui&s;ition. But the principal advantage the&s;e i&s;lands are likely to receive from the travels of Omai, will probably ari&s;e from the animals that have been left upon them; which, perhaps, they never would have obtained, if he had not come over to England. When the&s;e multiply, Otaheite, and the Society I&s;les, will equal any place in the known world, with re&s;pect to provi&s;ions.</P>
<P>Omai's return, and the &s;ub&s;tantial proofs he carried back with him of Briti&s;h liberality, en|couraged many to offer them&s;elves as volunteers to accompany us to <HI>Pretane.</HI> Captain Cook took every opportunity of expre&s;&s;ing his fixed deter|mination to reject all applications of that kind. Omai, who was ambitious of remaining the only great traveller among them, being afraid le&s;t the Captain might be prevailed upon to place others in a &s;ituation of rivalling him, frequently remind|ed him of the declaration of the Earl of Sandwich, that no others of his countrymen were to come to England.</P>
<P>Had there been the &s;malle&s;t probability of any &s;hip being again &s;ent to New-Zealand, the Com|modore would have brought the two youths of that country home with him, both of them be|ing very de&s;irous of continuing with us. Tawei|harooa, the elde&s;t, was endowed with &s;trong na|tural &s;en&s;e, was extremely well di&s;po&s;ed, and ca|pable of receiving any in&s;truction. He appear|ed
<PB N="55" REF="030274_0498_0FE56F48A3CA5E68">
to be &s;en&s;ible of the inferiority of his own country to the&s;e i&s;lands, and re&s;igned him&s;elf, though perhaps not without reluctance, to end his days at Huaheine in ea&s;e and plenty. But the other, named Kokoa, was &s;o &s;trongly attached to us, that it became nece&s;&s;ary to make u&s;e of force in carrying him a&s;hore. He was a &s;mart witty boy; and, on that account, great notice had been taken of him on board.</P>

<P>AS &s;oon as the boat, in which Omai was con|veyed a&s;hore, had returned, with the re|mainder of the haw&s;er, to the &s;hip, we hoi&s;ted
<PB N="56" REF="030274_0499_0FE56F0187DBA090">
her in, and &s;tood over for Ulietea without delay. The next morning, which was the 3d of No|vember, we made &s;ail round the &s;outhern end of that i&s;land, for the harbour of Ohamaneno. We met with variable light airs and calms alter|nately, &s;o that, at twelve o'clock, we were &s;till at the di&s;tance of a league from the mouth of the harbour; and while we were thus detained, Oreo, the chief of the i&s;land, with his &s;on and &s;on-in-law, came off to pay us a vi&s;it. All the boats were now hoi&s;ted out, and &s;ent a-head to tow, being a&s;&s;i&s;ted by a &s;light &s;outherly breeze. This &s;oon failing, and being &s;ucceeded by an ea&s;terly one, which blew right out of the harbour, we were obliged to anchor at its entrance, about two o'clock, and to warp in, which employed us till night. We were no &s;ooner within the harbour than our &s;hips were &s;urrounded with canoes, filled with the natives, who brought a &s;upply of fruit and hogs, which they exchanged for our commodites.</P>
<P>The following day, the Re&s;olution was moored clo&s;e to the northern &s;hore, at the head of the harbour; and the Di&s;covery along-&s;ide the &s;outhern &s;hore. Captain Cook, in the mean time, returned Oreo's vi&s;it, and pre&s;ented that chief with a red-feathered cap from Tongataboo, a &s;hirt, a linen gown, and a few other things of le&s;s value. Oreo, and &s;ome of his friends, then accompanied him on board to dinner. On Thur&s;|day
<PB N="57" REF="030274_0500_0FE56F2A5AFF8790">
the 6th, the ob&s;ervatories were &s;et up, and the nece&s;&s;ary in&s;truments carried on &s;hore. The two &s;ucceeding days, Captain Cook, Mr. King, and Mr. Bayly, ob&s;erved the &s;un's azimuths, both on &s;hore and on board, with all the compa&s;&s;es, in order to di&s;cover the variation. Nothing re|markable happened, till very early in the morn|ing of the 13th, when a marine, named John Harri&s;on, who was &s;entinel at the ob&s;ervatory, de&s;erted, taking with him his mu&s;quet and ac|co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">trements. As &s;oon as we gained intelligence which way he had gone, a party was detached in &s;earch of him; but they returned towards the evening, without &s;ucce&s;s. The next day, Cap|tain Cook applied to the chief concerning this affair, who promi&s;ed to &s;end a party of the i&s;lan|ders after the fugitive, and give us hops that he &s;hould be brought back in the cour&s;e of that day. This however, did not happen; and we had rea&s;on to imagine, that the chief had taken no &s;teps towards finding him.</P>
<P>We had, at this time, a con&s;iderable number of the natives about our &s;hips, and &s;everal thefts were committed; the con&s;equences of which be|ing apprehended by them, very few of them came to vi&s;it us the next morning. Oreo him|&s;elf caught the alarm, and fled with his whole family. Captain Cook con&s;idered this as a good opportunity to in&s;i&s;t upon their delivering up the de&s;erter; and having heard that he was then at
<PB N="58" REF="030274_0501_0FE56F035D8E21B0">
a place called Hamoa, &s;ituated on the other &s;ide of the i&s;land he repaired theither with two armed boats, attended by a native. In their way, they met with the chief, who al&s;o embarked with them. The Captain, with a few of his men, landing about a mile and a half from the &s;pot, marched up to it, with great expedition, le&s;t the &s;ight of the boats &s;hould give the alarm, and allow the offender &s;ufficient time to make his e&s;cape to the mountains. This precaution proved unnece&s;&s;ary; for the natives of that part of the i&s;land having obtained information of the Captain's approach, were prepared to deliver up the fugitive. He was found, with his mu&s;quet lying before him &s;eated betwixt two women, who, the in&s;tant that the Captain entered the hou&s;e, ro&s;e up to plead in his vindication. As &s;uch proceedings de&s;erved to be di&s;couraged, the Captain, with a &s;tern look, bid them be gone; upon which they bur&s;t into tears, and retired. Paha, the chief of that di&s;|trict, now came with a &s;ucking-pig, and a plan|tain-tree, which he was on the point of pre&s;enting to Captain Cook, as a peace-offering; who re|jected it, and having ordered the chief to quit his pre&s;ence, embarked with Harri&s;on in one of the boats, and returned to the &s;hips. After this harmony was &s;peedily re&s;tored. The delinquent made no other excu&s;e for his conduct, than that the natives had enticed him away: which perhaps was in a great mea&s;ure true, as Paha, and
<PB N="59" REF="030274_0502_0FE56F4A29E60360">
the two women above-mentioned, had been at the &s;hip the day before his de&s;ertion. As he had remained at his &s;tation till within a few minutes of the time in which he was to have been re|lieved by another, the puni&s;hment he received was not very &s;evere.</P>
<P>About a fortnight after we had arrived in Ulie|tea, Omai di&s;patched two of his people in a ca|noe, with intelligence, that he continued un|di&s;turbed by the inhabitants of Huaheine, and that every thing &s;ucceeded with him, except that his goat had died in kidding. This informa|tion was accompanied with a reque&s;t that Cap|tain Cook would &s;end him another goat, and al&s;o two axes&punc; Plea&s;ed with this additional oppor|tunity of &s;erving his friend, the Captain &s;ent back the me&s;&s;engers to Huaheine, on the 18th, with the axes, and a male and female kid.</P>
<P>On Wedne&s;day the 19th, the Commodore de|livered to Captain Clerke his in&s;tructions how to proceed, in ca&s;e of &s;eparation, after quitting the&s;e i&s;lands. The purport of the&s;e in&s;tructions was as follows: that, whereas the pa&s;&s;age from the Society I&s;les to the nothern coa&s;t of America was of con&s;iderable length, and as a part of it mu&s;t be performed in the depth of winter, when boi&s;terous weather mu&s;t be expected, which might perhaps occa&s;ion a &s;eparation, Captain Clerke &s;hould take all po&s;&s;ible care to prevent this; but that if the two &s;hips &s;hould chance to be &s;epa|rated,
<PB N="60" REF="030274_0503_0FE56EE6AF707478">
he, after &s;earching for Captain Cook, and not finding him in five days, was to proceed to|wards the coa&s;t of New Albion, and endeavour to fall in with it in the latititude of 45&deg;, where he was to cruize for him ten days; and not &s;ee|ing him in that time, was to put into the fir&s;t convenient harbour, in or to the north of that latitude, to obtain refre&s;hments, and take in wood and water that, during his continuance in port he was con&s;tantly to look out for Captain Cook; and if the latter did not join him before the 1&s;t of April following, he was to proceed northward to the latitude of 56&deg;, where, at &s;uch a di&s;tance from the coa&s;t as did not exceed fifteen leagues, he was to cruize for him till the 10th of May; and not finding him, was to proceed on a north|erly cour&s;e, and attempt to di&s;cover a pa&s;&s;age into the Atlantice Ocean, either through Hud|&s;on's or Baffin's Bays, as directed by the in&s;truc|tions of the Board of Admiralty: that, if he &s;hould fail in tho&s;e endeavours he was to re|pair to the harbour of St. Peter and St. Paul in Kamt&s;chatka, and pa&s;s the winter there: but that if he could not procure refre&s;hments at that port, he was at liberty to go where he &s;hould think proper, leaving with the Governor, before his departure, an account of his de&s;tination, to be delivered to Captain Cook on his arrival; and that, in the &s;pring of the year following (1779) he was to return to the port above-mentioned:
<PB N="61" REF="030274_0504_0FE56F4BB0287DC0">
that if he then received no further orders from Captain Cook, &s;o as to ju&s;tify his pur&s;uing any other mea&s;ures than tho&s;e which were pointed out in the in&s;tructions of the Lords of the Admiralty, his future proceedings were to be directed by them; and that, in ca&s;e of being prevented, by illne&s;s or any other cau&s;e, from carrying the&s;e, and the in&s;tructions of their Lord&s;hips, into exe|cution, he was to leave them with the officer who was next in command.</P>
<P>While we lay moored to the &s;hore, we &s;crubbed both &s;ides of the bottoms of our ve&s;&s;els, and al&s;o fixed &s;ome plates of tin under the binds. The&s;e plates Captain Cook received from the ingenious Mr. Pelham, Secretary to the Commi&s;&s;ioners for victualling the royal navy, for the purpo&s;e of try|ing whether tin would &s;ucceed as well as copper, in &s;heathing the bottoms of &s;hips.</P>
<P>On Monday the 24th, in the morning, the Commodore was informed that two of the Di&s;|covery's people, one of whom was a mid&s;hipman, were mi&s;&s;ing. Not long after, we learned from the natives, that they had embarked in a canoe the preceding night, and were now at the other end of the i&s;land. As the Mid&s;hipman had ex|pre&s;&s;ed a de&s;ire of continuing at one of the&s;e i&s;lands, it was extremely probable that he and his companion had gone off with that intent. Captain Clerke therefore, with two armed boats, and a detachment of marines, &s;et out in que&s;t of
<PB N="62" REF="030274_0505_0FE56EE85BADD890">
the fugitives, but returned in the evening with|out &s;ucce&s;s. From the conduct of the i&s;landers&punc; he was of opinion, that they intended to con|ceal the de&s;erters; and, with this view, had de|ceived him with fal&s;e information, directing h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> to &s;eek for them where they could not be found. He was not mi&s;taken; for the next morning, intelligence was brought, that the two runaways were in the I&s;le of Otaha. The&s;e not being the only per&s;ons in the &s;hips who were de&s;irous of remaining at the&s;e favourite i&s;lands, it was ne|ce&s;&s;ary, in order to give an effectual di&s;courage|ment to any further de&s;ertion, to recover them at all events. Captain Cook therefore deter|mined to go in pur&s;uit of them him&s;elf, having ob&s;erved that the natives &s;eldom attempted to amu&s;e him with fal&s;e information. He accord|ingly &s;et out with two armed boats, accompa|nied by Oreo him&s;elf. They proceeded, without &s;topping at any place, till they came to the ea&s;tern &s;ide of Otaha, where they put a&s;hore; and the chief di&s;patched a man before them, with orders to &s;eize the fugitives, and keep them till the Captain and his attendants &s;hould arrive with the boats. But when they had got to the place where they expected to find them, they were informed, that they had quitted this i&s;land, and gone to Bolabola the preceding day. The Captain, not chu&s;ing to follow them thither, returned to the &s;hips, with a full determination to have recour&s;e
<PB N="63" REF="030274_0506_0FE56F5D1DF192B8">
to a mea&s;ure, which, he had rea&s;on to believe, would compel the natives to re&s;tore them.</P>
<P>On the 26th, &s;oon after break of day, Oreo, with his &s;on, daughter, and &s;on-in-law, having come on board the Re&s;olution, Captain Cook re|&s;olved to detain the three la&s;t, till our de&s;erters &s;hould be delivered up. With this wiew, Cap|tain Clerke invited them on board his &s;hip; and, as &s;oon as they arrived in his cabin, a &s;entinel was placed at the door, and the window &s;ecured. This proceeding greatly &s;urprized them; and Captain Clerke having explained the rea&s;on of it they bur&s;t into tears, and begged he would not kill them. He a&s;&s;ured them he would not, and that the moment his people were brought back, they &s;hould be relea&s;ed. This however, did not remove their unea&s;ine&s;s, and they bewailed their fate in &s;ilent &s;orrow. The chief being with Cap|tain Cook when he received intelligence of this affair, immediately mentioned it to him, ima|gining that this &s;tep had been taking without his knowledge and approbation. The Captain in|&s;tantly undeceived him; and then he began to entertain apprehen&s;ions with re&s;pect to his own &s;ituation, and his countenance indicated the great|e&s;t perturbation of mind. But the Captain &s;oon quieted his fears, by telling him, that he was at liberty to quit the &s;hip whenever he cho&s;e, and to take &s;uch &s;teps towards the recovery of our two men, as he &s;hould judge be&s;t calculated for
<PB N="64" REF="030274_0507_0FE56EEF9B3A3ED0">
that purpo&s;e; and that, if he &s;hould meet with &s;ucce&s;s, his friends on board the Di&s;covery &s;hould be relea&s;ed from their confinement: if not, that they &s;hould certainly be carried away with us. The Captain added, that the chief's conduct, as well as that of many of his countrymen, in not only a&s;&s;i&s;ting the&s;e two men to make their e&s;cape, but in endeavouring, at this very time, to pre|vail upon others to follow them, would ju&s;tify any mea&s;ure that would &s;erve to put a &s;top to &s;uch proceedings. This explanation of the mo|tives upon which the Commodore acted, &s;eemed to remove, in a great degree, that general con&s;ter|nation into which Oreo, and his people who were pre&s;ent, were at fir&s;t thrown. But, though relieved from all apprehen&s;ions with regard to their own &s;afety, they were &s;till under the deepe&s;t concern for the pri&s;oners in the Di&s;covery. Num|bers of them went under the &s;tern of that &s;hip in canoes, and lamented their captivity with long and loud exclamations. The name of Poe|dooa (for that was the appellation of Oreo's daughter) re&s;ounded from every quarter; and the women not only made a mo&s;t di&s;mal howling, but &s;truck their bo&s;oms, and cut their heads with &s;hark's teeth, which occa&s;ioned a con&s;iderable effu&s;ion of blood.</P>
<P>The chief now di&s;patched a canoe to Bola|bola, with a me&s;&s;age to Opoony, king of that i&s;land, informing him of what had happened
<PB N="65" REF="030274_0508_0FE56F5036442A88">
and reque&s;ting him to &s;eize the two de&s;erters, and &s;end them back. The me&s;&s;enger, who was the father of Oreo's &s;on-in-law Pootoe, came to receive Captain Cook's commands before his departure; who &s;trictly enjoined him not to return without the fugitives, and to tell Opoony, from him, that if they had left the i&s;le of Bolabola, he mu&s;t &s;end canoes in pur&s;uit of them.</P>
<P>The impatient natives, not thinking proper to tru&s;t to the return of our people for the relea&s;e of the pri&s;oners, were induced to meditate an at|tempt, which if it had not been prevented might have involved them in &s;tell greater di&s;tre&s;s. Between five and &s;ix o'clock, Captain Cook, who was then on &s;hore, abrea&s;t of the &s;hip, ob&s;erved that all their conoes, in and about the harbour, began to move off. He enquired, in vain, for the cau&s;e of this; till our people, calling to us from the Di&s;covery, informed us, that &s;ome of the i&s;landers had &s;eized Captain Clerke and Mr. Gore, as they were walking at a &s;mall di&s;tance from the &s;hips. The Commodore, &s;truck with the boldne&s;s of this &s;cheme of retaliation, which &s;eemed to counteract him in his own way, in|&s;tantly commanded his people to arm; and, in a few minutes, a &s;trong party, under the conduct of Mr. King, was &s;ent to the re&s;cue of our two gentlemen. Two armed boats, and a party under Mr. William&s;on, were di&s;patched at the &s;ame time to intercept the flying canoes in their re|treat
<PB N="66" REF="030274_0509_0FE56F1DD686B558">
to the &s;hore. The&s;e detachments had &s;carce|ly gone out of &s;ight, when intelligence arrived that we had been mi&s;informed; upon which they were immediately called in.</P>
<P>It manife&s;tly appeared, however, from &s;everal corroborating particulars, that the natives had actually formed the de&s;ign of &s;eizing Captain Clerke; and they even made no &s;ecret in &s;peak|ing of it the following day. But the principal part of their plan of operations was to have laid hold of the per&s;on of Captain Cook. He was ac|cu&s;tomed to bathe every evening in the fre&s;h water; on which occa&s;ions he frequently went alone, and always unarmed. Expecting him to go this evening, as u&s;ual, they had re&s;olved upon &s;eizing him, and Captain Clerke likewi&s;e, if he had accompanied him. But Captain Cook, after confining the chief's family, had taken care to avoid putting him&s;elf in their power; and had cautioned Captain Clerke and the officers, not to go to any con&s;iderable di&s;tance from the &s;hips. Oreo, in the cour&s;e of the afternoon, a&s;ked our Commodore, three or four times, if he would not go to the batihing place; till at length finding that he could not be prevailed upon, he retired, with his people, notwith&s;tanding all our entreaties to the contrary. Having no &s;u&s;picion, at this time, of their de&s;ign, Captain Cook imagined, that a &s;udden panic had &s;eized them, which would probably be &s;oon over. Being di&s;appointed with
<PB N="67" REF="030274_0510_0FE56F1A62FED108">
re&s;pect to him, they fixed upon tho&s;e who were more in their power. It was a fortunate circum|&s;tance that they did not &s;ucceed in their de&s;ign, and that no mi&s;chief was done on the occa&s;ion; no mu&s;quets being fired, except two or three, to &s;top the canoes; to which firing, perhaps, Cap|tain Clerke and Mr. Gore owed their &s;afety<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is not improbable that they were al&s;o indebted for their &s;afety to Captain Clerke's walking with a pi&s;tol in his hand, which he once fired. We mention this circum&s;tance on the authority of Captain King.</NOTE>; for, at that moment, a party of the i&s;landers, armed with clubs, were marching towards them, but di&s;per&s;ed on hearing the report of the mu&s;|quets.</P>
<P>This con&s;piracy was fir&s;t di&s;covered by a girl who had been brought from Huaheine by one of our officers. Happening to overhear &s;ome of the Ulieteans &s;ay, that they would &s;eize Me&s;&s;rs. Clerke and Gore, &s;he immediately ran to acquaint the fir&s;t of our people that &s;he met with. Tho&s;e who had been intru&s;ted with the execution of the de|&s;ign, threatened to put her to death, as &s;oon as we &s;hould quit Ulietea, for di&s;appointing them. Being aware of this, we contrived that the girl's friends &s;hould come, a day or two afterwards, and take her out of the &s;hip, to convey her to a place where &s;he might remain concealed, till &s;he &s;hould find an opportunity of returning to Huaheine.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="030274_0511_0FE56F3648E7DC88">On Thur&s;day the 27th, we took down our ob|&s;ervatories, and carried on board whatever we had a&s;hore; we then unmoored the &s;hips, and moved a little way down the harbour, where we anchored again. Towards the afternoon the na|tives, &s;haking off their apprehen&s;ions, gathered round, and on board, our &s;hips, as u&s;ual; and the unplea&s;ing tran&s;actions of the preceding day &s;eemed to be almo&s;t forgotten by both parties. In the &s;ucceeding night the wind blew in hard &s;qualls, which were accompanied with heavy &s;howers of rain. In one of the&s;e &s;qualls, the cable by which the Re&s;olution was riding at an|chor, parted; but, as we had another anchor ready to let go, the &s;hip was quickly brought up again.</P>
<P>No account of our two fugitives having been received from Bolabola, Oreo now &s;et out for that i&s;land, de&s;iring Captain Cook to follow him, the next day, with the &s;hips. This was the Cap|tain's intentions; but the wind prevented our getting out to &s;ea. The &s;ame wind, however, which detained us in the harbour, brought back Oreo, with the two de&s;erters, from Bolabola. They had reached Otaha on the night of their de&s;ertion; but being, unable for the want of wind, to get to any of the i&s;lands lying to the ea&s;tward, as they at fir&s;t intended, they had pro|ceeded to Bolalola, and thence to a little i&s;land called Toobace, where they were apprehended by
<PB N="69" REF="030274_0512_0FE56F54A0C772F0">
Pootoe's father. As &s;oon as they were brought on board, the three pri&s;oners in the Di&s;covery were re&s;tored to their liberty. Such was the ter|mination of an affair, which had given the Com|modore much trouble and vexation.</P>
<P>The wind continuing con&s;tantly between the north and we&s;t, kept us in the harbour till Sunday the 7th of December; when, at eight o'clock in the morning, we weighed and made &s;ail, with a light breeze at the north-ea&s;t point. During the preceding week, we had been vi&s;ited by per&s;ons from all quarters of the i&s;land, who afforded us a plentiful &s;upply of hogs and green plantains, &s;o that the time we remained wind-bound in the harbour was not totally lo&s;t; for green plantains are an excellent &s;uccedaneum for bread, and will keep good for two or three weeks. Be&s;ides being furni&s;hed with the&s;e provi&s;ions, we al&s;o took in plenty of wood and water</P>
<P>The Ulieteans appeared to be, in general &s;maller and more black than the natives of the adjacent i&s;lands, and &s;eemed al&s;o le&s;s orderly, which may, perhaps, be owing to their having become &s;ubject to the inhabitants of Bolabola. Oreo, their chief, is only a kind of deputy of the Bolabolan monarch; and the conque&s;t &s;eems to have dimini&s;hed the number of &s;ubordinate chiefs re&s;ident among them: they are, therefore, le&s;s immediately under the eye of tho&s;e who&s;e in|tere&s;t it is to enforce a proper obedience. Though
<PB N="70" REF="030274_0513_0FE56F620DF39FF0">
Ulietea is now reduced to this &s;tate of humiliating dependence, it was formerly, as we were in|formed, the mo&s;t eminent of this group of i&s;lands, and was probably the fir&s;t &s;eat of goverment; for we were told, that the pre&s;ent royal family of Otaheite derives its de&s;cent from that which ruled here before the late revolution. The dethroned king of Ulietea, who&s;e name is Ooroo, re&s;ides at Huaheine, furni&s;hing, in his own per&s;on, an in|&s;tance not only of the in&s;tability of power, but al&s;o of the re&s;pect paid by the&s;e i&s;landers to par|ticulur familes of princely rank; for they allow Ooroo to retain all the en&s;igns which are appro|priated by them to royalty, notwith&s;tanding his having been deprived of his dominions. We ob|&s;erved a &s;imilar in&s;tance of this during our &s;tay at Ulietea, where one of our occa&s;ional vi&s;itants was Captain Cook's old friend Oree, late chief of Huaheine. He &s;till maintained his con&s;e|quence, and was con&s;tantly attended by a numer|ous retinue.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>HAVING taking our leave of Ulietea, we &s;teered for Bolabola. Our principal rea&s;on for vi&s;iting this i&s;land was, to procure one of the anchors which had been lo&s;t at Otaheite by Mon|&s;ieur de Bougainville. This, we were informed, had been afterwards found by the natives there, and &s;ent by them to Opoony, the chief of Bola|bola. It was not on account of being in want of anchors that we were anxious to get po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it; but, having parted with all our hatchets, and other iron tools and implements in purcha&s;ing refre&s;hments, we were now obliged to create a fre&s;h a&s;&s;ortment of trading articles, by fabricating them from the &s;pare iron we could find on board, and even the greate&s;t part of that had been already
<PB N="72" REF="030274_0515_0FE56F1BEBE58C80">
expended. Captain Cook, therefore, &s;uppo&s;ed Mons. de Bougainville's anchor would, in a great mea&s;ure, &s;upply our want of this u&s;eful material, and he did not entertain a doubt that Opoony might be induced to part with it.</P>
<P>Oreo, accompanied by &s;ix or eight others from Ulietea, attended us to Bolabola; and, indeed, mo&s;t of the natives, except the chief, would gladly have taken a pa&s;&s;age with us to England. At &s;un-&s;et, being off the &s;outh point of Bolabola, we &s;hortened &s;ail, and pa&s;&s;ed the night making &s;hort boards. On the 8th, at day break, we made &s;ail for the harbour, on the we&s;t &s;ide of the i&s;land. The wind being &s;cant, it was nine o'clock before we were near enough to &s;end away a boat to found the entrance.</P>
<P>The ma&s;ter, when he returned with the boat, reported, that the entrance of the harbour was rocky at the bottom, but that there was good ground within; and the debth of water twenty-five and twenty-&s;even fathoms; and that there was room to turn the &s;hips in. Upon this infor|mation, we attempted to work the &s;hips in; but, the wind and tide being again&s;t us, we made two or three trips, and found it could not be accom|pli&s;hed till the tide &s;hould turn in our favour. Whereupon Captain Cook gave up the de&s;ign of carrying the &s;hips into the harbour, and embark|ing in one of the boats, attended by Oreo and his companions, was rowed in for the i&s;land.</P>

<P><PB N="73" REF="030274_0517_0FE56F3C4E78DD50">As &s;oon as they were got a&s;hore, the Commo|dore was introduced to Opoony, &s;urrounded by a va&s;t concour&s;e of people. The nece&s;&s;ary formality of compliments being over, he reque&s;ted the chief to give him the anchor; and, to induce him to comply with the reque&s;t, produced the pre&s;en he intended for him. It con&s;i&s;ted of a linen night|gown, &s;ome gauze handkerchiefs, a &s;hirt, a look|ing-gla&s;s, &s;ome beads and toys, and &s;ix axes. Opoony, however, refu&s;ed to accept the pre&s;ent till the Commodore had received the anchor; and ordered three per&s;ons to go and deliver it to him; with directions to receive from him what he thought proper in return. With the&s;e me&s;&s;engers we &s;et out in our boats for a neighbouring i&s;land, where the anchor had been depo&s;ited; but it was neither &s;o large, nor &s;o perfect, as we expected. By the mark that was upon it, we found that it had originally weighed &s;even hundred pounds; but it now wanted the two palms, the ring, and part of the &s;hank. The rea&s;on of Opoony's re|fu&s;ing Captain Cook's pre&s;ent was now apparent; he, doubtle&s;s, &s;uppo&s;ed that the anchor, in its pre&s;ent &s;tate, was &s;o much inferior to it in value, that, when he &s;aw it, he would be di&s;plea&s;ed. The Commodore, notwith&s;tanding, took the an|chor as he found it, and &s;ent the whole of the pre|&s;ent, which he, at fir&s;t, intended. This nego|ciation being completed, the Commodore returned on board, hoi&s;ted in the boats, and made &s;ail to

the north. But, while we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> hoi&s;ting in the boats, we were vi&s;ited by &s;ome of the natives, who came off, in three or four canoes, to &s;ee the &s;hips. They brought with them one pig, and a few cocoa-nuts.</P>
<P>Had we remained there till the next day, we &s;hould probably have been &s;upplied with plenty of provi&s;ions; and the natives would, doubtle&s;s be di&s;appointed when they found we were gone: but, having already a good &s;tock of hogs and fruit on board, and not many articles left to purcha&s;e more, we had no inducement to defer the pro&s;e|cution of our voyage.</P>
<P>Oteavanooa, the harbour of Bolabola, &s;ituated on the we&s;t &s;ide of the i&s;land, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ery capacious; and, though we did not enter it, Captain Cook had the &s;atisfaction of being informed, by per&s;ons employed by him for that purpo&s;e, that it was a very proper place for the reception of &s;hips.</P>
<P>Towards the middle of this i&s;land is a lofty double-peaked mountain, which appeared to be barren on the ea&s;t &s;ide, but, on the we&s;t &s;ide, has &s;ome trees or bu&s;hes. The lower grounds, towards the &s;ea, like the other i&s;lands of this ocean, are covered with cocoa-palms, and bread-fruit trees. There are many little i&s;lots that &s;ur|round it, which add to the number of its inha|bitants and to the amount of its vegetable pro|ductions.</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="030274_0519_0FE56F09A7DD9100">Con&s;idering the &s;mall extent of Bolabola, being only eight leagues in circumference, it is remark|able that its people &s;hould have been able to con|quer Ulietea and Otaha; the former of which i&s;lands is, alone, more than double its &s;ize. In each of Captain Cook's three voyages, the war which produced this great revolution, was fre|quently mentioned; and, as it may amu&s;e the reader, we &s;hall give the hi&s;tory, of it as related by them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Ulietea and Otaha had long been friends; or as the natives emphatically expre&s;s it, they were con&s;idered as two brothers, who&s;e views and in|tere&s;ts where the &s;ame. The i&s;land of Huaheine was al&s;o admitted as their friend, but not in &s;o eminent a degree. Like a traitor, Otaha leagued with Bolabola, jointly to attack Ulietea; who&s;e people required the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of their friends of Huaheine, again&s;t the&s;e united powers. The in|habitants of Bolabola were encouraged by a pro|phete&s;s, who predicted their &s;ucce&s;s; and, that they might rely upon her prediction, &s;he de&s;ired a man might be &s;ent to a particular part of the &s;ea, where, from a great depth, would ari&s;e a &s;tone. He was accordingly &s;ent in a canoe to the place &s;pecified, and was going in&s;tantly to dive after the &s;tone, when, behold, it &s;pontaneou&s;ly &s;tarted up to the &s;urface, and came immediately into his hand! All the people were a&s;toni&s;hed at the &s;ight; the &s;tone was deemed &s;acred, and de|po&s;ited
<PB N="76" REF="030274_0520_0FE56F3DD5D26148">
in the hou&s;e of the <HI>Eatooa</HI>; and is &s;till pre&s;erved, as a proof that this prophete&s;s had great influence with the divinity. Elevated with the hopes of victory, the canoes of Bolabola at|tacked tho&s;e of Ulietea and Huaheine; the en|counter was of long duration, and, notwith&s;tand|ing the miracle, the Bolabola fleet would have been vanqui&s;hed, had not that of Otaha arrived at the critical moment. The fortune of the day was now turned, and their enemies were totally de|feated. Two days after, the men of Bolabola invaded Huaheine, of which they made them|&s;elves ma&s;ters; it being weakly defended, as mo&s;t of its warriors were then ab&s;ent. Many of its fugitives, however, having got to Otaheite, there related their lamentable tale. This &s;o affected their own countrymen, and tho&s;e of Ulietea whom they found in that i&s;land, that they ob|tained their a&s;&s;i&s;tance. They were furni&s;hed with only ten fighting canoes, and with that incon|&s;iderable force, effected a landing at Huaheine, when dark at night; and, taking the Bolabola men by &s;urprize, killed many of them, and di&s;|per&s;ed the re&s;t. Thus they again po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them|&s;elves of their own i&s;land, which now remains in|dependent, and is governed by its own chiefs. When the united fleets of Ulietea and Huaheine were defeated, the men of Bolabola were applied to by their allies of Otaha to be allowed an equal &s;hare of the conque&s;ts. This being refu&s;ed, the
<PB N="77" REF="030274_0521_0FE56FD5CF703988">
alliance broke; and, during the war, Otaha was conquered, as well as Ulietea, both of which re|main &s;ubject to Bolabola; the chiefs by whom they are governed, being only deputies to Opoony, the king of that i&s;land.</P>
<P>Such was their hi&s;tory of the war. It has al|ready been ob&s;erved, that the&s;e people are ex|tremely deficient in recollecting the exact dates of pa&s;t events. And, re&s;pecting this war, though it happened but a few years ago, we could only gue&s;s at the time of its commencement and dura|tion, the natives not being able to &s;atisfy our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">|quiries with any preci&s;ion. The final <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of Ulietea; which terminated the war, had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> atchieved before Captain Cook was there in 1769; but it was very apparent that peace had not been long re&s;tored, as marks of recent ho&s;tilities having been committed were then to be &s;een. By at|tending to the age of Teereetareea, the pre&s;ent chief of Huaheine, &s;ome additional collateral proof may be gathered. He did not appear to be above ten or twelve years of age, and his fa|ther, we were informed, had been killed in one of the engagements.</P>
<P>The Bolabola men, &s;ince the conque&s;t of Ulie|tea and Otaha, are con&s;idered as invincible; and their fame is &s;o far extended, that, even at Ota|heite, if not dreaded, they are re&s;pected for their valour. It is a&s;&s;erted, that they never fly from an enemy, and that they always are victorious
<PB N="78" REF="030274_0522_0FE56FD757CAD200">
again&s;t an equal number of the other i&s;landers. Their neighbours, too, a&s;cribe much to the &s;upe|riority of their god, who, they believed, detained us by contrary winds at Ulietea.</P>
<P>The e&s;timation in which the Bolabola men are held at Otaheite, may be gathered from Mon&s;ieur de Bougainville's anchor having been &s;ent to their &s;overeign. The intention of tran&s;porting the Spani&s;h bull to their i&s;land, mu&s;t be a&s;cribed to the &s;ame cau&s;e. And they already po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a third European curio&s;ity, a male animal brought to Otaheite by the Spainards. This animal had been &s;o imperfectly de&s;cribed by the natives, that we had been much puzzled to conjecture what it could be. Some good, however, generally ari&s;es out of evil. When Captain Clerke's de&s;erters were brought back from Bolabola, they told us the animal had been &s;hewn to them, and that it was a ram. If our men had not de&s;erted, it is probable we &s;hould never have known this.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of this intelligence, Captain Cook, when he landed to meet Opoony, carried an ewe on &s;hore, of the Cape of Good Hope breed; by which he has probably laid the foundation for a breed of &s;heep at Bolabola. He al&s;o left with Oreo, at Ulietea, two goats, and an Engli&s;h boar and &s;ow: &s;o that the race of hogs will be con|&s;iderably improved, in a few years, at Otaheite, and all the neighbouring i&s;lands; and they will,
<PB N="79" REF="030274_0523_0FE56FD92BF3F018">
perhaps, be &s;tocked with many valuable Euro|pean animals.</P>
<P>When this is really the ca&s;e, the&s;e i&s;lands will be unrivalled in abundance, and variety of refre&s;h|ments for the &s;upply of navigators. Even in their pre&s;ent &s;tate, they are hardly to be excelled. When the inhabitants are not di&s;turbed by inte&s;|tine broils, which has been the ca&s;e for &s;everal years pa&s;t, their productions are numerous and plentiful.</P>
<P>If we had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a greater a&s;&s;ortment of goods, and a proper quantity of &s;alt, we might have &s;alted as much pork, as would have been &s;ufficient to la&s;t both &s;hips almo&s;t a year. But we quite ex|hau&s;ted our trading commodities at the Friendly I&s;lands, Otaheite, and its neighbourhood. Our axes, in particular, were nearly gone, with which, alone, hogs were, in general, to be purcha&s;ed. The &s;alt that remained on board, was not more than was requi&s;ite for curing fifteen puncheons of meat.</P>
<P>The following proce&s;s of curing pork has been adopted by Captain Cook in his &s;everal voyages. The hogs were killed in the evening; when cleaned, they were cut up, and the bone taken out. The meat was &s;alted while it was hot, and laid &s;o as to permit the juices to drain from it, till the next morning: it was then &s;alted again, put into a ca&s;k, and covered with pickle. It re|mained, in this &s;ituation, four or five days; when
<PB N="80" REF="030274_0524_0FE56F76A1D072C8">
it was taken out, and carefully examined; and, if any of it appeared to be in the lea&s;t tainted. which was &s;ometimes the ca&s;e, it was &s;eparated from the re&s;t, which was repacked, headed up, and filled with good pickle. It was again exa|mined in about eigth or ten days time, but there appeared to be no nece&s;&s;ity for it, as it was gene|rally found to be all perfectly cured. Bay and white &s;alt, mixed together, an&s;wers the be&s;t, though either of them will do alone. Great care was taken that none of the large blood-ve&s;&s;els re|mained in the meat; and not too much &s;hould be packed together at the fir&s;t &s;alting, lea&s;t tho&s;e pieces which are in the middle &s;hould heat, and hinder the &s;alt from penetrating them. In tro|pical climates, meat ought not to be &s;alted in rainy &s;ultry weather.</P>
<P>Europeans having, of late, &s;o frequently vi|&s;ited the&s;e i&s;landers, they may, on that account, have been induced to breed a larger &s;tock of hogs; knowing that, whenever we come, they may be certain of receiving what they e&s;teem a valuable con&s;ideration for them. They daily ex|pect the Spainards at Otaheite, and, in two or three years time, they will doubtle&s;s expect the Engli&s;h there, as well as the other i&s;lands. It is u&s;ele&s;s to a&s;&s;ure them that you will not return, for they &s;uppo&s;e you cannot avoid it; though none of them either know, or enquire, the rea&s;on of your coming. It would, perhaps, have been
<PB N="81" REF="030274_0525_0FE56FDF48FA1498">
better of the&s;e people, to have been ignorant of our &s;uperiority, than, after once knowing it, to be abandoned to their original incapacity. They cannot, indeed, be re&s;tored to their former happy mediocrity, if the intercour&s;e between us &s;hould be di&s;continued</P>
<P>It is, in a manner, incumbent on the Euro|peans to pay them occa&s;ional vi&s;its (once in three or four years) to &s;upply them with tho&s;e articles, which we, by introducing, have given them a predilection for. The want of &s;uch &s;upplies may be &s;everely felt, when it is too late to return to their old imperfect contrivances, which they now de&s;pi&s;e and di&s;card. When the iron tools, with which we have furni&s;hed them, are worn out, their own will be almo&s;t forgotten. A &s;tone hatchet is now as great a curio&s;ity among them, as an iron one was &s;even or eight years ago; and a chi&s;&s;el made of bone, or &s;tone, is no where to be &s;een. Spike nails have been &s;ub&s;tituted in the room of the latter articles; and they are weak enough to imagine, that their &s;tore of them is in|exhau&s;tible, for they were no longer &s;ought after.</P>
<P>Knives happened at this time, to be in high e&s;timation at Ulietea; and axes and hatchets bore unrivalled &s;way at all the i&s;lands. Re&s;pecting ar|ticles merely ornamented, the&s;e i&s;landers are as changeable as the mo&s;t poli&s;hed European na|tions; for, an article which may be prized by them to-day, may, perhaps, be rejected to mor|row,
<PB N="82" REF="030274_0526_0FE56FE10F6740A8">
as a fa&s;hion or wim may alter. But our iron implements are &s;o evidently u&s;eful, that they mu&s;t continue to be high in their e&s;timation. They would indeed, be mi&s;erable, if they &s;hould cea&s;e to receive &s;upplies of what appears nece&s;|&s;ary to their comfortable exi&s;tence; as they are de&s;titute of the materials, and ignorant of the art of fabricating them.</P>
<P>In our former relations, too much has already been publi&s;hed, re&s;pecting &s;ome of the modes of life, which rendered Otaheite &s;o plea&s;ing an abode to many of our people; and, if we could add any fini&s;hing &s;trokes to that picture, we &s;hould be un|willing to exhibit a view of &s;uch licentious man|ners as cannot fail to be di&s;gu&s;ting.</P>
<P>Having now concluded our account re&s;pecting the&s;e i&s;lands, which &s;tand &s;o con&s;picuous in the li&s;t of our di&s;coveries, we refer the reader to the following chapter, for which we are indebted to Mr. Ander&s;on.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>AFTER &s;ome prefatory remarks, on the accounts of the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive voyages of Cap|tain Wallis, Mon&s;ieur de Bougainville, and Cap|tain Cook, Mr. Ander&s;on begins to relate &s;uch particulars concerning Otaheite, and its neigh|bouring i&s;lands, as he was able to procure from Omai, or by conver&s;ing with the other natives.</P>
<P>For the greate&s;t part of the year, the wind blows from between ea&s;t-&s;outh-ea&s;t, and ea&s;t-north-ea&s;t. It &s;ometimes blows with con&s;iderable
<PB N="84" REF="030274_0528_0FE56FE467257FE8">
force, and is called by the natives <HI>Maaraee.</HI> When the wind blows &s;trong, the weather is u&s;u|ally cloudy, with &s;ome rain; but, when it is more moderate, it is clear, &s;ettled and &s;erene: if the wind &s;hould veer to &s;outh-ea&s;t, or &s;outh-&s;outh-ea&s;t, it blows more gently and is called <HI>Maoai.</HI> In December and January, when the &s;un is nearly vertical, both the winds and weather are very va|riable; but it often blows from we&s;t-north-we&s;t, or north-we&s;t. This wind is called <HI>Toerou</HI>; and is u&s;ually attended by cloudy weather, and &s;ome|times rain. It &s;eldom continues more than five or &s;ix days without interruption; and is the only wind that will permit the inhabitants of the i&s;lands to leeward to vi&s;it this in their canoes. If the wind is &s;till more northerly, it has the different appellation of <HI>Era-potaia.</HI> The wind from &s;outh-we&s;t, and we&s;t-&s;outh-we&s;t, is more frequent than the former, and is u&s;ually gentle, with occa&s;i|onal calms and breezes, yet it &s;ometimes blows in very bri&s;k &s;qualls. The weather is then ge|nerally cloudy and rainy, with the clo&s;e hot air; often accompanied with much thunder and light|ning. Is called by the natives <HI>Etoa.</HI></P>
<P>Though the natives have no very accurate knowledge of tho&s;e changes they pretend to have drawn &s;ome conclu&s;ions from their effects. When the &s;ea has a hollow &s;ound, and da&s;hes mildly on the &s;hore, they &s;ay it portends good weather: but, if it &s;ounds har&s;hly, and the waves
<PB N="85" REF="030274_0529_0FE56FE8591BE310">
rapidly &s;ucceed each other, the rever&s;e is to be expected.</P>
<P>The &s;outh-ea&s;t part of Otaheite, affords one of the mo&s;t luxuriant pro&s;pects in the univer&s;e. The hills are high, &s;teep, and craggy; but they are co|vered to the very &s;ummits with trees and &s;hrubs; the rocks &s;eeming to po&s;&s;e&s;s the property of pro|ducing their verdant clothing. The lower land and vallies teem with various productions, that grow with exuberant vigour, and convey to the mind of the beholders, an idea, that no country upon earth can vie with this in the &s;trength and beauty of vegetation; nature has been equally li|beral in di&s;tributing rivulets, which glide through every valley, dividing, as they approach the &s;ea, into &s;everal branches, fertilizing the land, through which they run.</P>
<P>The habitations of the natives are irregularly &s;cattered upon the flat land; and many of them, along the &s;hore, afforded us a delightful &s;cene from our &s;hips; e&s;pecially as the &s;ea, within the reef, is perfectly &s;till, and affords, at all times, a &s;afe navigation for the inhabitants, who are often &s;een pa&s;&s;ing and repa&s;&s;ing in their canoes. On beholding the&s;e delightful &s;cenes, I have often regretted my inability to tran&s;mit &s;uch a de&s;crip|tion of them, as would convey an impre&s;&s;ion &s;omewhat &s;imilar to what I felt, who have been fortunate enough to have been on the &s;pot. The natural fertility of the country, combined with
<PB N="86" REF="030274_0530_0FE57008684BB838">
the mildne&s;s and &s;erenity of the elimate, has ren|dered the natives &s;o carele&s;s in their cultivation, that the &s;malle&s;t traces of it cannot, in many places, be di&s;covered, though overflowing with the riche&s;t productions. The cloth plant, and the <HI>ava,</HI> or intoxicating pepper, are almo&s;t the only things to which they &s;hew any attention.</P>
<P>The bread-fruit tree is never planted, but &s;prings from the roots of the old ones, which &s;pread them&s;elves near the &s;urface of the ground. Hence we may ob&s;erve, that the inhabitants of Otaheite, in&s;tead of being under a nece&s;&s;ity of planting their bread, will rather be obliged to prevent its progre&s;s; which is, perhaps, &s;ome|times done, to afford room for a different &s;ort of trees, which may enable them to make &s;ome va|riety in their food.</P>
<P>The principal of the&s;e trees are the cocoa-nut and plantain; the fir&s;t of which requires no at|tention, after it appears a foot or two above the ground; but the plaintain requires &s;ome care in the cultivation; for about three months after it &s;hoots up, it begins to bear fruit; during which time it puts forth young &s;hoots, which &s;upply a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of fruit; the old &s;tocks being cut down as the fruit is taken off.</P>
<P>The products of the i&s;land are more remark|able for their great abundance than for their variety; and curio&s;ities here are not very nume|rous. Among the&s;e may be reckoned a large
<PB N="87" REF="030274_0531_0FE5700A50E001E0">
lake of fre&s;h water, on the top of one of the highe&s;t mountains, at the di&s;tance of almo&s;t two days journey. It is remarkable for its depth, and abounds with eels of an enormous &s;ize. This being e&s;teemed the greate&s;t natural curio&s;ity of the country, travellers, who come from other i&s;lands, are u&s;ually a&s;ked, among the fir&s;t things, at their return, whether they have &s;een it. There is al&s;o a &s;mall pond of water on this i&s;land, which has a yellow &s;ediment at the bottom. It has the appearence of being very good, but has an of|fen&s;ive ta&s;te, and often proves fatal to tho&s;e who drink a quantity of it; and tho&s;e who bathe in it, break out in blotches.</P>
<P>On our arrival here, we were &s;truck with the remarkable contra&s;t between the inhabitants of Tongataboo, and tho&s;e of Otaheite; the former being of a robu&s;t make, and dark colour, and the latter having a di&s;tingui&s;hed delicacy and whitene&s;s. That difference, however, did not immediately preponderate in favour, of the Ota|heiteans; and, when it did it was, perhaps, oc|ca&s;ioned more by our becoming accu&s;tomed to them; the marks, which had recommended the others, beginning now to be forgotten.</P>
<P>The women however, of Otaheite, po&s;&s;e&s;s all tho&s;e delicate charecteri&s;tics, which in many coun|tries di&s;tingui&s;h them from the other &s;ex. The men wear their beards long here, and their hair con&s;iderably longer than at Tongataboo, which
<PB N="88" REF="030274_0532_0FE5700BD6F73620">
gave them a very different appearance. The Otaheiteans are timid and fickle. They are not &s;o mu&s;cular and robu&s;t as the Friendly I&s;landers, ari&s;ing, perhaps, from their being accu&s;tomed to le&s;s action; the &s;uperior fertility of their coun|try enabling them to lead a more indolent life. They have a plumpne&s;s and &s;moothne&s;s of the &s;kin; which, though more con&s;enant with our ideas of beauty, is far from being an advantage; and is attended with a kind of langour in all their mo|tions. This is vi&s;ible in their boxing and wre&s;t|ling, which di&s;play only the feeble efforts of chil|dren, if compared to the vigour and activity with which &s;uch exerci&s;es are performed at the Friendly I&s;lands.</P>
<P>As per&s;onal endowments are in high e&s;timation among them, they have various methods of im|proving them, according to their ideas of beauty. Among the <HI>Erreoes,</HI> or unmarried men, e&s;peci|ally tho&s;e of &s;ome con&s;equence, it is cu&s;tomary to undergo a kind of phy&s;ical operation, to ren|der them fair; which is done by continuing a month or two in the hou&s;e, wearing a great quan|tity of cloaths the whole time, and eating no|thing but bread-fruit, which they &s;ay is remark|ably efficacious in whitening the &s;kin. They al&s;o intimate, that their corpulence and colour, at other times, depend upon their food; being obliged, as the &s;ea&s;ons vary, to u&s;e different food at different times.</P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="030274_0533_0FE5700D5DF213A0">Nine-tenths, at lea&s;t, of their common diet, con&s;i&s;t of vegetable food; and the <HI>mahee,</HI> or fermented bread-fruit, which is an article in al|mo&s;t every meal, prevents co&s;tivene&s;s, and has a &s;ingular effect in producing coolne&s;s about them, which was not perceivable in us who fed on animal food. To this temperate cour&s;e of life, may, perhaps, be attributed their having &s;o few di&s;ea&s;es among them. Indeed, they men|tion only five or &s;ix chronic or national di&s;or|ders; among which are the drop&s;y, and the <HI>fefai,</HI> mentioned as frequent at Tongataboo. This was, however, before the arrival of the Euro|peans; for we have added a di&s;ea&s;e to their cata|logue, which abundantly &s;upplies the place of all the others, and is become almo&s;t univer&s;al; and for which they &s;eem to have no effectual remedy. The prie&s;ts, indeed, admini&s;ter a medly of &s;im|ples, but they acknowledge it never cures them. They admit, however, that in &s;ome few ca&s;es, nature alone has exterminated the poi&s;on of this loath&s;ome di&s;ea&s;e, and produced a perfect reco|very.

pieces of fle&s;h from different parts of the body; at other times, plucking out the eyes, then cut|ting off the no&s;e; and la&s;tly, completing the bu|&s;ine&s;s, by opening the belly. But this is only on very extraordinary occa&s;ions. If cheerfulne&s;s re|&s;ults from con&s;cious innocence, one would ima|gine their whole lives had been un&s;ullied with a crime. This, however, may be rather imputed to their feelings, which, though lively, are ne|ver permanent. Under any misfortune, after the critical moment is pa&s;t, they never labour un|der the appearance of anxiety. Care never pro|duces a wrinkle on their brow; even the approach of death does not deprive them of their viva|city. I have &s;een them, when on the brink of the grave by di&s;ea&s;e, and when preparing to at|tack the enemy; but, in neither of the&s;e ca&s;es, have I ever ob&s;erved their countenances over|clouded with melancholy or dread.</P>
<P>Di&s;po&s;ed, as they naturally are, to direct their aims to what will afford them ea&s;e or plea&s;ure, all their amu&s;ements tend to excite their amo|rous pa&s;&s;ions; and their &s;ongs, with which they are greatly delighted, are directed to the &s;ame purpo&s;e. A con&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of &s;en&s;ual enjoy|ments mu&s;t, however, cloy; and they occa&s;ionally varied them to more refined &s;ubjects; they chant|ed their triumphs in war, and their amu&s;ements in peace; their travels and adventures; and the peculiar advantages of their own i&s;land.</P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="030274_0535_0FE570146ADF43F8">This &s;hews that they are immoderately fond of mu&s;ic, and though they did not reli&s;h our com|plicated compo&s;itions, they were much delighted with the more melodious &s;ounds, when produced &s;ingly, as they, in &s;ome degree, re&s;embled the &s;implicity of their own. They equally experi|ence the &s;oothing effects produced, by particular kinds of motion; which, in many ca&s;es, will allay any perturbation of mind, as &s;ucce&s;sfully as mu&s;ic. Of this, the following may &s;erve as a remarkable in&s;tance. Walking, one day, about Matavi Point, I &s;aw a man in a &s;mall canoe, paddling with &s;uch expedition, and looking &s;o eagerly about him, as to command my whole at|tention. At fir&s;t, I &s;uppo&s;ed he had been pilfer|ing from one of the &s;hips, and was pur&s;ued; but he pre&s;ently repeated his amu&s;ement. He pro|ceeded from the &s;hore to the place where the &s;well begins; and, attentively watching its fir&s;t motion, paddled &s;wiftly before it, till he perceiv|ed it overtook him, and had acquired &s;ufficient &s;trength to force his canoe before it, without pa&s;&s;ing underneath. He then cea&s;ed paddling, and was carried along as rapidly as the wave, till he was landed upon the beach; when he &s;tarted from his canoe, emptied it, and went in pur&s;uit of another &s;well. He &s;eemed to experience the mo&s;t &s;upreme delight, while he was thus &s;wiftly and &s;moothly driven by the &s;ea. His mind was &s;o wholly occupied in this bu&s;ine&s;s, that, though

crouds of his countrymen were collected to ob|&s;erve our tents and &s;hips, as being objects that were both rare and curious to them, he did not notice them in the lea&s;t. Two or three of the natives drew near, while I was ob&s;erving him, and &s;eemed to partake of his felicity; calling out to inform him when there was an appearance of a favourable &s;well. This exerci&s;e, which I un|der&s;tand is very frequent among them, is called <HI>chorooe.</HI></P>
<P>Though the language of Otaheite &s;eems radi|cally the &s;ame as that of New-Zealand and the Friendly I&s;lands, it has not that guttural pronun|ciation, and is pruned of &s;ome of the con&s;onants, with which tho&s;e dialects abound; which has rendered it, like the manners of the inhabitants, &s;oft and &s;oothing. It abounds with beautiful and figurative expre&s;&s;ions, and is &s;o copious, that they have above twenty different names for the bread-fruit; as many for the <HI>taro</HI> root, and half that number for the cocoa-nut.</P>
<P>They have one expre&s;&s;ion corre&s;ponding ex|actly with the phra&s;eology of the Scriptures, viz. "Yearning of the bowels." They u&s;e it upon every occa&s;ion, when affected by the pa&s;&s;ions; con&s;tantly referring pain from grief, de&s;ire, and other affections, to the bowels, as the &s;eat of it; where they imagine, all opperations of the mind are al&s;o performed.</P>

<P>A very &s;mall portion of animal food is enjoy|ed by the lower cla&s;s of people; and if, at any time, they obtain any, it is either fi&s;h, &s;ea-eggs, or other marine productions; for pork hardly ever falls to their &s;hare. Only the <HI>Eree de hoi,</HI> is able to afford pork every day; and the infe|rior chiefs, according to their riches, perhaps once a week, a fortnight, or a month. Some|times, indeed, they are not allowed that; for, when the i&s;land is impoveri&s;hed by war, or any other means, a prohibition is granted again&s;t the killing of hogs, which &s;ometimes continues in force for &s;everal months, and even for a year or two. In &s;uch an interval, the hogs have multi|plied &s;o fa&s;t, that there have been in&s;tances of their changing there dome&s;tic &s;tate, and becom|ing wild.</P>
<P><PB N="96" REF="030274_0540_0FE57025346EB2F0">When this prohibition is taken off, the chiefs a&s;&s;emble at the king's habitation, each bringing with him a pre&s;ent of hogs. After this, the king orders &s;ome of them to be killed, of which they all partake, and each returns to his own home, with full permi&s;&s;ion to kill as many as he plea&s;es for his own u&s;e. On our arrival here, &s;uch a prohibition was actually in force, at lea&s;t in tho&s;e di&s;tricts under the immediate direction of Otoo. And, when we quitted Oheitepeha, fearing we &s;hould not have gone to Matavai, he &s;ent a me&s;|&s;enger to a&s;&s;ure us, that, as &s;oon as the &s;hips ar|rived there, it &s;hould be taken off.

<P>The <HI>ava</HI> is chiefly u&s;ed among the better &s;ort of people, but this beverage is differently pre|pared, from that which we &s;aw in the Friendly I&s;lands.

They al&s;o brui&s;e the leaves of the plant here, and pour water upon them, as upon the root. It is not drank in large companies, in that &s;ociable way which is practi&s;ed among the people at Tongataboo; but it has more perni|cious effects here, owing, perhaps, to the man|ner

of its preparation; as we &s;aw frequent in|&s;tances of its intoxicating powers.</P>
<P>Many of us, who had vi&s;ited the&s;e i&s;lands be|fore, were &s;uprized to find &s;everal of the natives, who were remarkable for their &s;ize and corpu|lency when we &s;aw them la&s;t, now almo&s;t re|duced to &s;keletons; and the cau&s;e of this altera|tion was univer&s;ally attributed to the u&s;e of the <HI>ava.</HI> Their &s;kins were dry, rough, and covered with &s;cales; which, they &s;ay, occa&s;ionally fall off, and their &s;kin becomes, in &s;ome degree, renewed. As an excu&s;e for &s;o de&s;tructive a practice, they alledge, it is to prevent their growing too cor|pulent; but it e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ervates them exceedingly, and probably &s;hortens the duration of their lives.</P>
<P>Their meals at Otaheite are every frequent. The fir&s;t is about two o'clock in the morning, after which they go to &s;leep; the next is at eight; they dine at eleven, and again, as Omai expre&s;&s;ed it, at two, and at five; and they go to &s;upper at eight. They have adopted &s;ome very whim&s;ical cu&s;toms in this article in dome&s;tic life: the women are not only obliged to eat by them&s;elves, but are even excluded from partaking of mo&s;t of the better &s;orts of food. Turtle, or fi&s;h of the tunny kind, they dare not touch, though it is high in e&s;teem; &s;ome particular &s;orts of the be&s;t plantains are al&s;o forbidden them; and even tho&s;e of the fir&s;t rank are &s;eldom permitted to eat pork. The children of both &s;exes al&s;o eat
<PB N="98" REF="030274_0542_0FE57026BB3472C8">
apart; and the women u&s;ually &s;erve up their own provi&s;ions.</P>
<P>In this, and many other cu&s;toms, relative to their eating, there is &s;omething exceedingly my&s;|terious. On our inquiring into the rea&s;ons of it, we were told, it was nece&s;&s;ary that it &s;hould be &s;o; and that was the only an&s;wer we could receive when we interrogated them upon that &s;ubject.</P>
<P>They are not &s;o ob&s;cure and my&s;terious in their other cu&s;toms re&s;pecting the females, e&s;pecially with regard to their connections with the men. When a young man and women, from mutual choice, agree to cohabit, the man makes a pre|&s;ent to the father of the girl of the common ne|ce&s;&s;aries of life, as hogs, cloth, or canoes; and if he &s;uppo&s;es he has not received a valuable con&s;ideration for his daughter, he compels her to leave her former friend, and to cohabit with a per&s;on who may be more liberal. The man, indeed, is always at full liberty to make a new choice; or, &s;hould his con&s;ort become a mother, he may de&s;troy the child; and afterwards either leave the women, or continue his connection with her. But if he adopts the child, and per|mits it to live, the man and women are then con|&s;idered as in the married &s;tate; and after that they &s;eldom &s;eparate. A man may however, without being cen&s;ured, join a more youthful
<PB N="99" REF="030274_0543_0FE5702C06740210">
partner to his fir&s;t wife, and live with both of them.</P>
<P>The cu&s;tom of changing their conjugal con|nections is very general, and is &s;o common an occurrence, that they mention it with indiffer|ence. The <HI>erreoes,</HI> or tho&s;e of the better &s;ort who po&s;&s;e&s;s the means of purcha&s;ing a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of fre&s;h connections, are generally roaming about; and, having no particular attachment, &s;eldom adopt the plan of a &s;ettled cohabitation. And this licentious plan of life is &s;o agreeable to their di&s;po&s;ition, that the mo&s;t beautiful of both &s;exes exhau&s;t their youthful days in practices which would di&s;grace the mo&s;t &s;avage tribes. The&s;e enormities are peculiarly &s;hocking in a country who&s;e general character has, in other re&s;pects, evident traces of the prevalence of humane feelings. When an <HI>erreoe</HI> women brings forth a child, it is &s;uffocated by applying a cloth to its mouth and no&s;e, which has been previou&s;ly dipped in water.</P>
<P>As the women, in &s;uch a life, mu&s;t contribute greatly to its happine&s;s, it is &s;urpri&s;ing that they &s;hould not only &s;uffer the mo&s;t humiliating re|&s;traints with regard to food, but &s;hould be of|ten treated with a degree of brutality, which one would &s;uppo&s;e a man mu&s;t be incapable of to|wards an object for whom he had the lea&s;t affec|tion or e&s;teem. It is, however, extremely com|mon to &s;ee the men beat them mo&s;t unmerci|fully;
<PB N="100" REF="030274_0544_0FE5702E1B18B8C8">
and unle&s;s this behaviour proceeds from jealou&s;y, which both &s;exes &s;ometimes pretend to be infected with, it will be difficult to a&s;&s;ign a rea&s;on for it. This may the more readily be ad|mitted as a motive, as I have known many in|&s;tances where intere&s;t has been rejected for per|&s;onal beauty; though even in the&s;e ca&s;es, they are not &s;u&s;ceptible of tho&s;e delicate &s;entiments that re&s;ult from mutual affection. Platonic love is hardly known in Otaheite.</P>
<P>From a notion of cleanline&s;s, the cutting of the fore&s;kin is a practice adopted among them; and they be&s;tow a reproachful epithet upon tho&s;e who neglect that operation. When five or &s;ix lads in a neighbourhood are pretty well grown up, it is made known to a <HI>tahoua</HI> by the fa|ther of one of them. The <HI>t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">houa,</HI> attended by a &s;ervant, conducts the lads to the top of the hills; and after &s;eating one of them in a proper manner, places a piece of wood beneath the fore&s;kin, at the &s;ame time amu&s;ing him by de&s;iring him to look a&s;ide at &s;omething which he pretends to &s;ee; the young man's attention being thus engaged, he immediately cuts through the &s;kin with a &s;hark's tooth, and &s;eparates the divided parts; then, after putting on a bandage, he performs the &s;ame operation on the other lads who attend him.</P>
<P>Five days after they have been thus di&s;ciplin|ed, they bathe, the bandages are removed, and
<PB N="101" REF="030274_0545_0FE5702FA29610A0">
the matter is clean&s;ed away. When five days more are expired, they bathe again, and are recovered; but, as a thickne&s;s of the prepuce remains, occa&s;ioned by the cutting, they again a&s;cend the mountains with the <HI>tahoua</HI> and &s;er|vant, where a fire is prepared, and &s;ome &s;tones heated; between two of which the prepuce is placed by the <HI>tahoua,</HI> and is gently &s;queezed, in order to remove the thickne&s;s. This done, they return home, adorned with odoriferous flowers; and the <HI>tahoua</HI> is rewarded by the fathers of the lads, according to their &s;everal abilities, with a pre&s;ent of hogs and cloth; and if their poverty will not permit them to make a proper acknow|ledgment, there relations on this, occa&s;ion are expected to be liberal.</P>
<P>Their religious &s;y&s;tem abounds in &s;ingularities, and few of the common people have a compe|tent knowledge of it, that being principally con|fined to their prie&s;ts, which indeed are nume|rous. They pay no particular re&s;pect to one god, as po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing pre-eminence; but believe in a plurality of divinities, who have each a pleni|tude of power.</P>
<P>As different parts of the i&s;land, and the other neighbouring i&s;lands, have different gods, the re&s;pective inhabitants imagine they have cho&s;en the mo&s;t eminent, or one who is at lea&s;t &s;uffi|ciently powerful to protect them, and to &s;upply their nece&s;&s;ities. If he &s;hould not give them
<PB N="102" REF="030274_0546_0FE57031DE33B850">
&s;atisfaction, they think it no impiety to change. An in&s;tance of this kind has lately happened in Tiaraboo, where two divinities have been di&s;|carded, and Oraa, god of Bolabola, has been adopted in their room. They have probably been induced to make this new choice, becau&s;e his people have been victorious in war; and hav|ing, &s;ince their new election, been &s;ucce&s;sful again&s;t the inhabitants of <HI>Otaheite-nooe,</HI> it is &s;ole|ly imputed to <HI>Oraa,</HI> who literally fights their battles.</P>
<P>In &s;erving their gods, their a&s;&s;iduity is re|markably con&s;picuous. The <HI>whattas</HI> or offering-places of the <HI>morais</HI> are, in general, loaded with fruits and animals; and almo&s;t every hou&s;e has a portion of it &s;et apart for a &s;imilar purpo&s;e. Many of them are &s;o rigidly &s;crupulous in their reli|gious matters, that they will not even begin a meal, till they have laid a &s;ide a mor&s;el for the <HI>eatooa;</HI> and we have &s;een their &s;uper&s;titious zeal carried to a mo&s;t pernicious height in their hu|man &s;acrifices, which are, I fear, too frequent. They probably have recour&s;e to them to avert misfortunes. Their prayers, which they always chant like the &s;ongs in their fe&s;tive entertainments, are al&s;o very frequent.</P>
<P>As in other ca&s;es, &s;o in religion, the women are obliged to &s;hew their inferiority. When they pa&s;s the <HI>morais</HI> they mu&s;t partly uncover them|&s;elves, or take an exten&s;ive circuit to avoid them.
<PB N="103" REF="030274_0547_0FE5703973DF6F28">
Though they do not entertain an opinion, that their god mu&s;t be continually conferring bene|fits, without &s;ometimes for&s;aking them, they are le&s;s concerned at this, than at the attempts of &s;ome inau&s;picious being to injure them. <HI>Etee,</HI> they &s;ay, is an evil &s;pirit, who delights in mi&s;|chief; to whom they make offerings, as well as to their divinity. But all the mi&s;chiefs they apprehend from invi&s;ible beings, are merely temporal.</P>
<P>As to the &s;oul, they believe it to be both im|mortal and immaterial; that during the pangs of death, it keeps fluttering about the lips; and that it a&s;cends, and is eaten by the deity; that it continues in this &s;tate for &s;ome time; after which it takes its pa&s;&s;age to a certain place, de&s;tined to receive the &s;ouls of men, and has exi&s;tence in eternal night; or rather in a kind of dawn, or twilight.</P>
<P>They expect no permanent puni&s;hment hereaf|ter for crimes committed upon earth; the &s;ouls of good and bad men being indi&s;criminately eaten by the deity. But they con&s;ider this coalition as a kind of nece&s;&s;ary purification before they enter the regions of bli&s;s; for their doctrine in|culcates, that tho&s;e who refrain from all &s;en&s;ual connection with women &s;ome months before they depart this life, pa&s;s into their eternal man&s;ion without &s;uch a previous union, as if by &s;uch an

ab&s;tinence they were &s;ufficiently pure to be ex|empted from the general lot.</P>
<P>They have not indeed tho&s;e &s;ublime concep|tions of happine&s;s which our religion, and in|deed our rea&s;on, teach us to expect hereafter. Immortality is the only great privilege they think they &s;hall acquire by death; for they &s;uppo&s;e that &s;pirits are not entirely dive&s;ted of tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ions by which they were actuated when combined with material vehicles. Thus, at a meeting of &s;ouls which were formerly enemies, many con|flicts may en&s;ue, which mu&s;t certainly be inef|fectual as tho&s;e who are in this invi&s;ible &s;tate mu&s;t be invulnerable.</P>
<P>Their rea&s;oning is &s;imilar with regard to the meeting of a man and his con&s;ort. If the hu&s;|band departs this life fir&s;t, the &s;oul of his wife is no &s;tranger to him on its arrival in the land of &s;pirits. They renew their former intimacy in a capacious building, called <HI>Tourooa,</HI> where de|parted &s;ouls a&s;&s;emble to recreate them&s;elves with the gods. The hu&s;band then conducts her to his &s;eparate habitation, where they eternally re|&s;ide, and have an offspring, which, however, is purely &s;piritual, as their embraces are &s;uppo&s;ed to be far different from tho&s;e of corporeal beings.</P>
<P>Many of their notions re&s;pecting the Deity are extravagantly ab&s;urd. They &s;uppo&s;e him to be under the influence of tho&s;e &s;pirits who de|rive their exi&s;tence from him&punc; and that they fre|quently

eat him, though he has power to re|create him&s;elf. They cannot conver&s;e about im|material things, without referring to material ob|jects to convey their meaning, and therefore per|haps they u&s;e this mode of expre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>They furthe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> add, that, in the <HI>tourooa,</HI> the deity inquires whether they mean to de&s;troy him, or not; and their determination is unalterable. This is not only known to the &s;pirits, but al&s;o to the inhabitants of the earth; for, when the moon is on its wane, they are &s;uppo&s;ed to be de|vouring their <HI>eatooa;</HI> and, in the proportion that it increa&s;es, he is renewing him&s;elf. And the &s;uperior, as well as the inferior gods are liable to this accident.</P>
<P>Other places, they al&s;o believe, are prepared for the reception of departed &s;ouls. Thus they are of opinion, that tho&s;e who are drowned in the &s;ea continue there, and enjoy a delight|full country, &s;umptuous habitations, and every thing that can contribute to their happine&s;s. They even maintain that all other animals have &s;ouls; and even trees, fruit, and &s;tones; which, at their decea&s;e, or upon their being con&s;umed or broken, a&s;cend to the deity, from whom they pa&s;s into their de&s;tined man&s;ion.</P>
<P>They imagine, that every temporal ble&s;&s;ing is derived from their punctual performance of re|ligious offices. They believe that the powerful influence of the divine &s;pirit is univer&s;ally dif|fu&s;ed,

and therefore it cannot be matter of &s;ur|prize that they adopt many &s;uper&s;titious opi|nions concerning its opperations. Sudden deaths and all other accidents, they &s;uppo&s;e to be effected under the immediate impul&s;e of &s;ome divinity. If a man receives a wound in his toe, by &s;tumbling again&s;t a &s;tone, it is imputed to an <HI>Eatooa.</HI></P>
<P>In the night, on approaching a <HI>toopapaoo,</HI> where dead bodies are expo&s;ed, they are &s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">tled and terrified; as many of our ignorent and &s;uper|&s;titious people are at the &s;ight of a church-yard, or with the apprehen&s;ions of gho&s;ts. They have implicit confidence in dreams, &s;uppo&s;ing them to be communications from their deity, or from the &s;pirit of their friends who have departed this life; and that tho&s;e who are favoured with them can foretell future events: but this kind of knowledge is limited to particular per&s;ons. Omai pretend|ed to have the&s;e communications. He a&s;&s;ured us, that on the 26th of July 1776, his father's &s;oul had intimated to him in a dream, that he &s;hould land &s;omewhere in three days; but he was unfortunate in his fir&s;t prophetic attempt, for we did not get into Teneri&s;&s;e till the fir&s;t of Augu&s;t.</P>
<P>Their dreamers, however, are thought little inferior to their in&s;pired prie&s;ts and pri&s;te&s;&s;es, who&s;e predictions are univer&s;ally credited; and all undertakings of con&s;equence are determined

<P>They have &s;trange ob&s;cure traditions concern|ing the creation. Some godde&s;s, they &s;ay, had a lump of earth &s;u&s;pended in a cord, and, by giving it a &s;wing round, &s;cattered about &s;everal pieces of land, which con&s;tituted Otaheite and the adjacent i&s;lands; and that they were all peo|pled by one of each &s;ex, who originally fixed at Otaheite; but this only re&s;pects their own imme|diate creation; for they admit of an univer&s;al one before this. Their remote&s;t account extends to Tatooma and Tapuppa, who are male and fe|male rocks, and &s;upport our globe. The&s;e begat Totorro, who was killed and divided into parts or parcels of land; then Otaia and Oroo were produced, who were afterwards married, and fir&s;t begat land, and then a race of gods, Otaia being king, Oroo marries her &s;on, a god, named Teorroha, whom &s;he orders to create animals, more land, and every kind of food found upon the earth. She al&s;o ordered him to create a

&s;ky, which is &s;upported by men, called Tee&s;erel. The &s;pots ob&s;ervable in the moon, they &s;ay, are groves of a certain tree, which once grew in Otaheite and being accidentally de&s;troyed, &s;ome doves carried its &s;eeds thither, where they flouri&s;h at this day.</P>
<P>They have many religious and hi&s;torical le|gends; one of which, relative to eating human fle&s;h, is in &s;ub&s;tance as follows: A very long time ago there lived, at Otaheite, two men who were called <HI>Taheeai;</HI> a name which is now given to cannibals. They inhabited the mountains, whence they i&s;&s;ued forth and murdered the na|tives, whom they afterwards devoured, and thus prevented the progre&s;s of population. Two bro|thers, anxious to rid the country of &s;uch enemies, &s;ucce&s;sfully put in practice a &s;tratagem for their de&s;truction. They lived farther upward than the <HI>Taheeai,</HI> and were &s;o &s;ituated, that they could conver&s;e with them without hazarding their own &s;afety. They invited them to partake of an en|tertainment, to which they readily con&s;ented. The brothers then heated &s;ome &s;tones in a fire, and thru&s;ting them into pieces of <HI>mahee,</HI> reque&s;t|ed one of the <HI>Taheeai</HI> to open his mouth; when one of tho&s;e pieces was immediately dropped in, and &s;ome water poured after it, which, in quench|ing the &s;tone, made a hi&s;&s;ing no&s;e and killed him. The other was intreated to do the &s;ame; but at fir&s;t declined it, mentioning the con&s;e|quences
<PB N="109" REF="030274_0553_0FE5704C5EDE67A0">
of his companion's eating: but upon being a&s;&s;ured that the food was excellent, that the&s;e effects were only temporal, and that his companion would &s;oon recover, he was &s;o credu|lous as to &s;wallow the bait, and was al&s;o killed.</P>
<P>Their bodies were then cut to pieces, and bu|ried by the natives, who rewarded the brothers with the government of the i&s;land, for delivering them from &s;uch mon&s;ters. They re&s;ided at Wha|paeenoo, a di&s;trict in the i&s;land, where there now remains a bread-fruit tree, which was once the property of the <HI>Taheeais.</HI> They had a woman who lived with them, that had two enormous teeth. After they were killed, &s;he lived at Ota|ha; and, when &s;he died, &s;he was ranked among their deities. She did not, like the men, feed upon human fle&s;h; but, from the prodigious &s;ize of her teeth, the natives &s;till call any animal that has large tu&s;ks <HI>Taheeai.</HI></P>
<P>This &s;tory, it mu&s;t be acknowledged, is as na|tural as that of Hercules de&s;troying the hydra, or of Jack the Giant-killer. But it does not appear that there is any moral couched under it, any more than under mo&s;t of the old fables, which have been received as truths in ignorant ages. It, however, was not injudiciou&s;ly introduced, as &s;erving to expre&s;s the dete&s;tation entertained here again&s;t cannibals. And yet it appears pro|bable from &s;ome circum&s;tances, that the natives of the&s;e i&s;les formerly fed upon human fle&s;h.
<PB N="110" REF="030274_0554_0FE5704DE690CD80">
Upon a&s;king Omai a few que&s;tions upon this &s;ub|ject, he re&s;olutely denied it; though, at the &s;ame time, he related a fact within his own knowledge, which almo&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hes &s;uch a conjecture.</P>
<P>When the Bolabola men defeated tho&s;e of Huaheine, many of his kin&s;men were &s;lain; but a relation of his had an opportunity of being re|venged, when the people of Bolabola were wor&s;t|ed in their turn; and, cutting a piece of fle&s;h from the thigh of one of his enemies, he broiled and devoured it. The offering made to the chief, of the eye of the per&s;on &s;acrificed, appears to be a ve&s;tige of a cu&s;tom that once exi&s;ted to a greater extent.</P>
<P>The principal characteri&s;tics of the &s;overeign are, the being inve&s;ted with the <HI>maro,</HI> the pre|&s;iding at human &s;acrifices, and the blowing of the conch-&s;hell. On hearing the latter, every &s;ubject is obliged to bring food, in proportion to his circum&s;tances, to his royal re&s;idence. Their veneration for his name, on &s;ome occa&s;ions, they carry to a mo&s;t extravagant height. When he accedes to the <HI>maro,</HI> if any words in the language are found to have a re&s;emblance to it in &s;ound, they are immediately changed for others; and, if any man &s;hould be pre&s;umptuous enough to continue the u&s;e of tho&s;e words, not only he, but his whole family are put to death.</P>
<P>A &s;imilar &s;ate attends all tho&s;e who &s;hall dare to apply the &s;acred name of the &s;overeign to any

animal. Whence Omai, when in England, ex|pre&s;&s;ed his indignation, that the names of prince or prince&s;s &s;hould be given to our dogs or hor&s;es. But though death is the puni&s;hment for taking this liberty with the name of the &s;overeign, abu&s;e again&s;t his government is only puni&s;hed with the forfeiture of land and hou&s;es.</P>
<P>The &s;overeign never deigns to enter the habi|tation of any of his &s;ubjects; in every di&s;trict, where he vi&s;its he has hou&s;es belonging to him|&s;elf. And if, by accident, he &s;hould ever be obliged to deviate from this rule, the habitation thus honoured with his pre&s;ence, together with its furniture, is entirely burnt. When pre&s;ent his &s;ubjects uncover to him as low as the wai&s;t; and when he is at any particular place, a pole with a piece of cloth affixed to it, is &s;et up in &s;ome con&s;picuous part near, on which the &s;ame honours are be&s;towed. To the fir&s;t part of this ceremony his brothers are entitled; but the wo|men only uncover to the royal females.</P>
<P>They are even &s;uper&s;titious in re&s;pect to their &s;overeign, and e&s;teem his per&s;on as almo&s;t &s;acred.</P>
<P>To the&s;e circum&s;tances, perhaps, he is indebted for the quiet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his dominions. Even the people of Tiaraboo admit his claim to the &s;ame honours, though they e&s;teem their own chief as more powerful, and a&s;&s;ert that, &s;hould the reigning family become extinct, he would &s;ucceed to the government of the whole i&s;land.</P>
<P><PB N="112" REF="030274_0556_0FE5705B8B050798">This indeed is probable, as Waheiadooa, ex|clu&s;ive of Tiaraboo, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es many di&s;tricts of Opooreanoo. The extent of his territories is, therefore, almo&s;t equal to tho&s;e of Otoo; and his part of the i&s;land is more populous and fertile. His &s;ubjects, too, have &s;hewn their &s;uperiority, by frequently defeating tho&s;e of Otaheite-nooe, whom they hold in a contemptible light as war|riors; and over whom they might be ea&s;ily vic|torious, if their chief &s;hould be inclined to put it to the te&s;t.</P>
<P>The people, exclu&s;ive of the <HI>Eree de hoi,</HI> and his family, are cla&s;&s;ed in the following order. The <HI>Erees,</HI> or powerful chiefs; the <HI>Manahoone,</HI> or va&s;&s;als; and the <HI>Teou,</HI> or <HI>Toutou,</HI> &s;ervants or &s;laves. The men, agreeably to the regular in&s;ti|tution, connect them&s;elves with women of their re&s;pective ranks; but if with one of an inferior cla&s;s and &s;he brings forth a child, it is not only pre&s;erved, but is entitled to the rank of the father; unle&s;s he &s;hould happen to be an <HI>Eree,</HI> in which ca&s;e the child is killed.</P>
<P>If a woman of condition permits a man of in|ferior rank to officiate as a hu&s;band, the children they produce are al&s;o killed. And if a <HI>Teou</HI> be detected in an intrigue with a female of the royal family he is puni&s;hed with death. The &s;on of the <HI>Eree de hoi,</HI> at his birth, &s;ucceeds his father in titles and honours; but, if he has no children the government devolves to his brother at his

death. Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, in other families, de&s;cend to the elde&s;t &s;on, who is, neverthele&s;s, obliged to &s;upport his brothers and &s;i&s;ters, and allow them hou&s;es on his e&s;tates.</P>
<P>Otaheite is divided into &s;everal di&s;tricts, the boundaries of whch are generally rivulets or low hills; but the &s;ubdivi&s;ions, by which particular property is a&s;certained&punc; are pointed out by large &s;tones which have continued from generation to generation. Quarrels are &s;ometimes produced, by the removal of the&s;e &s;tones, which are decided by battle; each party claiming the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his friends. But, upon a complaint being proper|ly made to the <HI>Eree de hoi,</HI> he determines the dif|ference in an amicable manner.</P>
<P>The&s;e offences, however, are not common; and property &s;eems to be as &s;ecure here, from long cu&s;tom, as from the &s;evere&s;t laws in other coun|tries. It is an e&s;tabli&s;hed practice among them, that crimes which are not of a general nature, are left to be puni&s;hed by the party who is in|jured, &s;uppo&s;ing that he will decide as equitably as a per&s;on totally unconcerned: and, long cu&s;|tom having alloted certain puni&s;hments for cer|tain crimes, he may inflict them, without being amenable to any one. If, for in&s;tance, any per|&s;on be detected &s;tealing, which is u&s;ually done in the night, the owner of the goods &s;tolen may kill the thief immediately. But they &s;eldom inflict &s;o &s;evere a puni&s;hment, unle&s;s the property taken is
<PB N="114" REF="030274_0558_0FE5705D12B8D8C0">
very valuable; &s;uch as plaited hair and brea&s;t-plates. When only cloth, or hogs, are &s;tolen, and the robber e&s;capes, if, upon his being after|wards di&s;covered, he engages to return the &s;ame number of hogs, and pieces of cloth, he is ac|quitted of the offence; or, at mo&s;t, receives a &s;light beating</P>
<P>If, in a quarrel, one per&s;on &s;hould kill another, the friend of the decea&s;ed attack the &s;urvivor and his adherents. If they are victorious, they take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the hou&s;e and property of the other party; but, if they are vanqui&s;hed, the re|ver&s;e takes place. Should a <HI>Manahoone</HI> kill the &s;lave of a chief, the latter &s;eizes the property of the former, who flies the country. A few months after, he returns, and, finding his &s;tock of hogs increa&s;ed, makes a large pre&s;ent of the&s;e, and other valuable articles, to the <HI>Toutou's</HI> ma&s;ter, who generally con&s;iders it as a compen&s;ation, and &s;uffers him to repo&s;&s;e&s;s his premi&s;es. But, it is not &s;urpri&s;ing that the killing of a man &s;hould be con&s;idered as &s;o trifling an offence, among a people who do not think it a crime to murder their own children. On conver&s;ing with them concerning &s;uch in&s;tances of unnatural cruelty, and a&s;king them if their chiefs were not offend|ed, and did not puni&s;h them; they &s;aid the chief had no right to interfere in &s;uch ca&s;es, every one being at liberty to do what he plea&s;ed with his own child.</P>
<P><PB N="115" REF="030274_0559_0FE56FF76EB4E8C0">Though the people, their cu&s;toms and man|ners, and the productions of the i&s;lands in the neighbourhood, may, in general, be con&s;idered the &s;ame as at Otaheite, yet there are a few differ|ences. In the little i&s;land Mataia, or O&s;naburgh I&s;land, which lies twenty leagues ea&s;t of Otaheite, is &s;poken a different dialect from that of Otaheite. The men of Mataia al&s;o wear long hair, and, pre|vious to their fighting, cover their arm with &s;ome|thing be&s;et with &s;harks teeth, and their bodies with a &s;kin of fi&s;hes, not unlike &s;hagreen. They are likewi&s;e ornamented with poli&s;hed pearl &s;hells, which make a refulgent glittering in the &s;un; and they have a very large one before, which covers them like a &s;hield.</P>
<P>In the language of Otaheite, there are many words and phra&s;es very different from tho&s;e of the i&s;lands to the we&s;tward of it. It is remark|able for producing, in great abundance, that de|licious fruit which we call apples, which are not to be found in any of the others, except Eimeo. It al&s;o produces an odoriferous wood, called <HI>eahoi,</HI> which is much e&s;teemed at the other i&s;les. Hua|heine and Eimeo produce more yams than the other i&s;lands; and, upon the hills at Mourooa, a particular bird is found, which is highly valued for its white feathers.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the number or clu&s;ter of i&s;lands, ex|tending from Mataia to Mourooa, we were in|formed by the people at Otaheite, that there was
<PB N="116" REF="030274_0560_0FE5705EDE746AD0">
a low uninhabited i&s;land, called Mopeeha; and al&s;o &s;everal low i&s;lands, to the north ea&s;tward, at the di&s;tance of about two days &s;ail with a fair wind.</P>
<P>At Mataeeva, it is &s;aid to be cu&s;tomary, for men to pre&s;ent their daughters to &s;trangers who vi&s;it that i&s;land. The pairs, however, mu&s;t lie near each other for the &s;pace of five nights, with|out pre&s;uming to take any liberties. On the &s;ixth evening, the father entertains his gue&s;t with food, and orders the daughter to receive him, that night, as her hu&s;band. Though the bed-fellow be ever &s;o di&s;agreeable to the &s;tranger, he mu&s;t not dare to expre&s;s the lea&s;t di&s;like; for that is an unpardonable affront, and puni&s;hable with death. Forty men of Bolalola, whom curio&s;ity had incited to go to Mataeeva, were treated in this manner; one of them having declared his aver&s;ion to the female who fell to his lot, in the hearing of a boy, who mentioned it to the father. Fired with this information, the Mataeevans fell upon them; but the Bolabolans killed thrice their own number, though with the lo&s;s of the whole party except five. The&s;e, at fir&s;t, conceal|ed them&s;elves in the woods, and afterwards ef|fected their e&s;cape in a canoe.</P>
<P>The low i&s;les are, perhaps, the farthe&s;t navi|gation performed by the inhabitants of Otaheite, and the Society I&s;lands. Mon&s;ieur de Bougain|ville is certainly in an error, when he &s;ays, "The&s;e

&s;carce ever having it in the &s;outh-ea&s;t point, till after he had cro&s;&s;ed the equator. Though a year and five months had now elap&s;ed &s;ince our depar|ture from England, during which period we had not been, upon the whole, unprofitably employed, Captain Cook was &s;en&s;ible, that, with re&s;pect to the principal object of his in&s;tructions, our voyage might be con&s;idered, at this time, as only at its commencement; and therefore, his attention to whatever might contribute towards our &s;afety and final &s;ucce&s;s, was now to be exerted as it were anew. He had with this view examined into the &s;tate of our provi&s;ions at the i&s;lands we had la&s;t vi&s;ited; and having now, on leaving them, pro|ceeded beyond the extent of the former di&s;co|veries, he ordered an accurate &s;urvey to be taken of all the &s;tores that were in each &s;hip, that, by being fully informed of the quantity and condi|tion of every article, he might know how to u&s;e them to the greate&s;t advantage.</P>
<P>Before we quitted the Society I&s;les, we had taken every opportunity of enquiring of the na|tives, whether there were any i&s;lands &s;ituated in a northerly or north-we&s;terly direction from them; but it did not appear that they knew of any; nor did we meet with any thing by which the vicinity of land was indicated, till we began, about the latitude of 8&deg; &s;outh, to &s;ee boobies, men-of-war bidrs, terns, tropic-birds, and a few other &s;orts. Our longitude, at this time, was 205&deg; ea&s;t. in
<PB N="119" REF="030274_0563_0FE57066C1773E80">
the night between the 22d and 23d, we cro&s;&s;ed the equinoctial line; and on the 24th, &s;oon after day-break, we di&s;covered land bearing north-ea&s;t by ea&s;t. It was found, upon our making a nearer approach to it, to be one of tho&s;e low i&s;lands which are &s;o frequently met with in this ocean between the tropics; that is, a narrow bank of land that enclo&s;es the &s;ea within. We ob&s;erved &s;ome cocoa-nut trees in two or three places; but the land in general had a very &s;terial a&s;pect. At twelve o'clock it was about four miles di&s;tant. On the we&s;tern &s;ide we found the depth of water to be from forty to fourteen fathoms, over a &s;andy bottom.</P>
<P>Captain Cook being of opinion that this i&s;land would prove a convenient place for procuring turtle, re&s;olved to anchor here. We accordingly dropped our anchors in thirty fathoms water; and a boat was immediately di&s;patched to &s;earch for a commodious landing-place. When &s;he re|turned, the officer who had been employed in this &s;earch, reported, that he found no place where a boat could land; but that fi&s;h greatly abounded in the &s;hoal-water, without the breakers. Early the next morning, which was Chri&s;tmas-day, two boats were &s;ent, one from each &s;hip, to examine more accurately whether it was practicable to land; and at the &s;ame time, two others were or|dered out, to fi&s;h at a grappling near the &s;hore. The&s;e la&s;t returned about eight, with as many fi&s;h
<PB N="120" REF="030274_0564_0FE56FF95D19E3E0">
as weighed upwards of two hundred pounds. En|couraged by this &s;ucce&s;s, the Commodore di&s;|patched them again after breakfa&s;t; and he then went him&s;elf in another boat, to view the coa&s;t, and attempt landing, which, however, he found to be impracticable. The two boats which had been &s;ent out on the &s;ame &s;earch, returned about twelve o'clock; and the ma&s;ter, who was in that belonging to the Re&s;olution, reported to Captain Cook, that, about four or five miles to the north|ward, there being a break in the land, and a chan|nel into the lagoon, there was con&s;equently a proper place for landing; and that he had found off this entrance the &s;ame foundings as we had where we now were &s;tationed. In con&s;equence of this report we weighed, and, after two or three trips, anchored again over a bottom of fine dark &s;and, before a little i&s;land lying at the entrance of the lagoon.</P>
<P>On Friday the 26th in the morning, the Com|modore ordered Captain Clerke to &s;end out a boat, with an officer in it, to the &s;outh-ea&s;t part of the lagoon, in que&s;t of turtle; and went him|&s;elf with Mr. King, each in a boat, to the north-ea&s;t part. It was his intention to have gone to the ea&s;tern extremity; but the wind not permit|ting it, he and Mr. King landed more to leeward, on a &s;andy flat, where they caught one turtle, which was the only one they &s;aw in the lagoon. They waded through the water to an i&s;land, where
<PB N="121" REF="030274_0565_0FE5706846A58DA8">
they found nothing but a few birds. Captain Cook, leaving Mr. King here to ob&s;erve the &s;un's meridian altitude, proceeded to the land that bounds the &s;ea towards the north-we&s;t, which he found even more barren than the la&s;t-mentioned i&s;le; but walking over to the &s;ea-coa&s;t, he ob&s;erved five turtles clo&s;e to the &s;hore, one of which he caught: he then returned on board, as did Mr. King &s;oon afterwards. Though &s;o few turtles were ob&s;erved by the&s;e two gentlemen, we did not de&s;pair of a &s;upply; for &s;ome of the officers of the Di&s;covery, who had been a&s;hore to the &s;outh|ward of the channel leading into the lagoon, had more &s;ucce&s;s, and caught &s;everal.</P>
<P>The next morning, the cutter and pinnace were di&s;patched, under the command of Mr. King to the &s;outh-ea&s;t part of the i&s;land, within the la|goon, to catch turtle; and the &s;mall cutter was &s;ent towards the north to the &s;ame purpo&s;e. Some of Captain Clerke's people having been on &s;hore all night, had been &s;o fortunate as to turn up|wards of forty turtles on the &s;and, which were this day brought on board; and, in the cour&s;e of the afternoon, the party detached to the north|ward returned with half a dozen; and being &s;ent back again, continued there till we departed from the i&s;land, having, upon the whole, pretty good &s;ucce&s;s. The day following (the 28th) Captain Cook, accompanied by Mr. Bayly, landed on the i&s;land &s;ituated between the two channels into
<PB N="122" REF="030274_0566_0FE57069CFC6E8F0">
the lagoon, to prepare the tele&s;copes for ob&s;erving the &s;olar eclip&s;e that was to happen on the 30th. Towards noon, Mr. King returned with one boat, and eight turtles; &s;even being left behind to be brought by the other boat, who&s;e people were occupied in catching more; and, in the evening, the &s;ame boat conveyed them provi&s;ions and wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">er. Mr. William&s;on now went to &s;uperintend this bu&s;ine&s;s in the room of Mr. King, who re|mained on board, in order to attend the ob&s;er|vation of the eclip&s;e. The next day, the two boates, laden with turtle, were &s;ent back to the &s;hip by Mr. William&s;on, who, at the &s;ame time, in a me&s;&s;age to Captain Cook, reque&s;ted, the the boats might be ordered round by &s;ea, as he had di&s;covered a landing-place on the &s;outh-ea&s;t &s;ide of the i&s;land, where the greate&s;t numbers of turtle were caught; &s;o that, by di&s;patching the boats thither, the trouble of carrying them over the land (as had hitherto been done) to the in&s;ide of the lagoon, would be &s;aved. This advice was followed.</P>
<P>On Tue&s;day the 30th, Captain Cook, and Me&s;&s;rs. King and Bayly repaired in the morn|ing to the &s;mall i&s;land above mentioned, to ob|&s;erve the eclip&s;e of the &s;un. The &s;ky was over|ca&s;t at times; but it was clear wen the eclip&s;e ended. In the afternoon, the party who had been employed in catching turtle at the &s;outh-ea&s;tern part of the i&s;land, returned on board, except a
<PB N="123" REF="030274_0567_0FE56FF3D4DDD3D0">
&s;ailor belonging to Captain Clerke's &s;hip, who had been mi&s;&s;ing for two days. At fir&s;t, there were two men who had lo&s;t their way; but hap|pening to di&s;agree with re&s;pect to the track that was mo&s;t likely to bring them to their compa|nions, they had &s;eparated; and one of them found means to rejoin the party, after an ab&s;ence of twenty-four hours, during which he had expe|rienced great di&s;tre&s;s. There being no fre&s;h water in the whole i&s;land, and not one cocoa-nut tree in that part of it, he, in order to allay his thir&s;t, had recour&s;e to the extraordinary expedient of drinking the blood of turtle, which he killed for that purpo&s;e. His method of refre&s;hing him|&s;elf, when fatigued, was equally &s;ingular, though he &s;aid he felt the good effects of it: he undre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf, and lay down in the &s;hallow water on the beach for &s;ome time.</P>
<P>How the&s;e two men had contrived to lo&s;e their way, was a matter of a&s;toni&s;hment. The land over which their journey lay, from the &s;ea-coa&s;t to the lagoon, where the boats were &s;tationed, did not exceed three miles acro&s;s; nor was there any thing that could impede their view; for the coun|try was level, with a few &s;hrubs di&s;per&s;ed about it; and, from many parts, the ma&s;ts of our ve&s;&s;els could be ea&s;ily di&s;cerned. This, however, was a rule of direction which they did not think of; nor did they recollect in what part of the i&s;land the &s;hips lay at anchor; and they were totally at a
<PB N="124" REF="030274_0568_0FE570711F5C1768">
lo&s;s how to get back to them, or to the party they had &s;o carele&s;&s;ly &s;traggled from. Con&s;idering what &s;trange people the generality of &s;ailors are, while on &s;hore, we might, in&s;tead of being much &s;urprized that the&s;e two &s;hould thus lo&s;e them|&s;elves, rather wonder that no more of the party were mi&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P>Captain Clerke was no &s;ooner informed that one of the &s;tragglers was &s;till in this di&s;agreeable &s;itu|ation, than he detached a party in &s;earch of him; but neither the man nor the party having re|turned, the next morning the Commodore ordered two boats into the lagoon, to pro&s;ecute the &s;earch by different tracks. In a &s;hort time after, Cap|tain Clerke's detachment returned, with there lo&s;t companion; in con&s;equence of which the boats di&s;patched into the lagoon were called back by &s;ignal. This man's di&s;tre&s;s mu&s;t have been far greater than that of the other &s;traggler; not only as he had been lo&s;t a longer time, but as he was too delicate to drink turtle's blood.</P>
<P>Having &s;ome yams and cocoa-nuts on board, in a &s;tate of vegetation, we planted them, by Captain Cook's order, on the &s;mall i&s;land where he had ob&s;erved the late eclip&s;e; and &s;ome &s;eeds of melons were &s;own in another place. The Captain al&s;o left on that little i&s;le a bottle, con|taining the followng in&s;cription:

It being late before this bu&s;ine&s;s was completed, he thought proper to defer &s;ailing till the next morning. We procured at this i&s;land, for both &s;hips, about three hundred turtles, which weighed, one with another, about ninety pounds; they were all of the green &s;ort, and, perhaps, not inferior in goodne&s;s to any in the world. We al&s;o caught, with hook and line, a great quantity of fi&s;h, principally con&s;i&s;t|ing of cavallies, &s;nappers, and a few rock-fi&s;h of two &s;pecies, one with whiti&s;h &s;treaks &s;cattered about, and the other with numerous blue &s;pots.</P>
<P>The &s;oil of this i&s;land (to which Captain Cook gave the name of Chri&s;tmas I&s;land, as we kept that fe&s;tival here) is, in &s;ome places, light and blacki&s;h, conpo&s;ed of &s;and, the dung of birds, and rotten vegetables. In other parts, it is formed of broken coral-&s;tones, decayed &s;hells, and other marine productions. The&s;e are depo|&s;ited in long, narrow ridges, lying parallel with the &s;ea-coa&s;t; and mu&s;t have been thrown up by the waves, though they do not reach, at pre&s;ent, within a mile of &s;ome of the&s;e places. This &s;eems to prove inconte&s;tably, that the i&s;land has been produced by different acce&s;&s;ions from the &s;ea, and is in a &s;tate of augmentation; the broken pieces of coral, and likewi&s;e many of the &s;hells

being too large and heavy to have been brought from the beach by any birds to the places where they are now lying. We could not find any where a drop of fre&s;h water, though we frequently dug for it. We met with &s;everal ponds of &s;alt water, which, as they had no vi&s;ible communication with the &s;ea, were probably filled by water filtrating through the &s;and during the time of high tides. One of the men who lo&s;t their way found &s;ome &s;alt on the &s;outh-ea&s;tern part of the i&s;land. We could not di&s;cover the &s;malle&s;t traces of any human creature having ever been here before us; and, indeed, &s;hould any one be accidentally driven on the i&s;land, or left there, he would hardly be able to prolong his exi&s;tence. For, though there are birds and fi&s;h in abundance, there are no vi&s;ible means of allaying thir&s;t, nor any vegetable that would &s;erve as a &s;ub&s;titute for bread, or correct the bad effects of an animal diet. On the few cocoa-nut trees upon the i&s;land, we found very little fruit, and that little not good.</P>
<P>A few low trees were ob&s;erved in &s;ome parts, be&s;ides &s;everal &s;mall &s;hrubs and plants, which grew in a very languid manner. We found a &s;ort of pur&s;lain, a &s;pecies of <HI>&s;ida</HI> or Indian mallow, and another plant that &s;eemed, from its leaves, to be a <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;embryanthemum;</HI> with two &s;orts of gra&s;s. Under the low trees &s;at va&s;t numbers of a new &s;pecies of tern, or egg-bird, black above, and white below, having a white arch on the fore|head.

The&s;e birds are &s;omewhat larger than the common noddy: their eggs are blui&s;h, and &s;peckled with black. There were likewi&s;e many common boobies; a &s;ort greatly re&s;embling a gannet; and a chocolate-coloured &s;pecies, with a white belly. Men-of-war-birds, curlews, plovers, tropic-birds, petrels, &amp;c. are al&s;o to be &s;een here. We &s;aw &s;everal rats, &s;maller than our's.

<P>Chri&s;tmas I&s;land is &s;uppo&s;ed by Captain Cook to be between fifteen and twenty leagues in cir|cuit. Its form is &s;emi-circular; or like the moon in her la&s;t quarter, the two horns being the north and &s;outh points. The we&s;t &s;ide, or the &s;mall i&s;land &s;ituate at the entrance into the lagoon, lies in the longitude of 202&deg; 30&prime; ea&s;t, and in the lati|tude of 1&deg; 59&prime; north.</P>

There is good anchorage on this bank, in any depth between eighteen and thirty fathoms. During our continuance here, the wind generally blew a fre&s;h gale at ea&s;t by &s;outh, or ea&s;t; and we had con&s;tantly a great &s;well from the north|ward, which broke on the reef in a very violent &s;urf.</P>

<P>WEIGHING anchor at day-break, on Friday the 2d of January, 1778, we re|&s;umed our northerly cour&s;e, with a gentle breeze at ea&s;t, and ea&s;t-&s;outh-ea&s;t, which continued till we arrived in the latitude of 7&deg; 45&prime; north, and the longitude of 205&deg; ea&s;t, where we had a day of perfect calm. A north-ea&s;t-by-ea&s;t wind then &s;ucceeded, which blew faintly at fir&s;t, but fre&s;hen|ed as we proceeded northward. We daily ob|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ved Tropic birds, men-of-war-birds, boobies,

&amp;c. and between the latitude 10&deg; and 11&deg; north, we &s;aw &s;everal turtles. Though all the&s;e are con&s;idered as &s;igns of the proximity of land, we di&s;covered none till early in the morning of Sun|day the 18th, when an i&s;land appeared, bearing north-ea&s;t-by-ea&s;t. Not long after, more land was &s;een, which bore north, and was totally de|tached from the former. At noon, the fir&s;t was &s;uppo&s;ed to be eight or nine leagues di&s;tant. Our longitude, at this time, was 200&deg; 41&prime; ea&s;t, and our latitude, 21&deg; 12&prime; north. The next day, at &s;un-ri&s;e, the i&s;land fir&s;t &s;een bore ea&s;t, at the di&s;tance of &s;everal leagues. Not being able to reach this, we &s;haped our cour&s;e for the other; and &s;oon after, ob&s;erved a third i&s;land, bearing we&s;t-north-we&s;t.</P>
<P>We had now a fine breze at ea&s;t-by-north; and, at noon, the &s;econd i&s;land, named Atooi, for the ea&s;t end of which we were &s;teering, was about two leagues di&s;tant. As we made a nearer approach, many of the inhabitants put off from the &s;hore in their canoes, and very readily came along-&s;ide the &s;hips. We were agreeably &s;ur|prized to find, that they &s;poke a dialect of the Otaheitean language. They could not be pre|vailed upon by any entreaties to come on board. Captain Cook tied &s;ome bra&s;s medals to a rope, which he gave to tho&s;e who were on board the canoes; and they, in return, fa&s;tened &s;ome mackarel to the rope, by way of equivalent. This
<PB N="130" REF="030274_0574_0FE57080C928DD28">
was repeated; and &s;ome &s;mall nails, or pieces of iron, were given them; for which they gave in exchange &s;ome more fi&s;h, and a &s;weet potatoe; a &s;ure indication of their having &s;ome notion of bartering, or, at lea&s;t, of returning one pre&s;ent for another. One of them even offered for &s;ale the piece of &s;tuff which he wore about his wai&s;t. The&s;e people did not exceed the ordinary &s;ize, and were &s;toutly made. Their complexion was brown; and though there appeared to be little difference in the ca&s;ts of their colour, there was a con&s;iderable variation in their features. Mo&s;t of them had their hair cropped rather &s;hort; a few had it tied in a bunch at the top of the head; and others &s;uffered it to flow loo&s;e. It &s;eemed to be naturally black; but the generality of them had &s;tained it with &s;ome &s;tuff which communicated to it a browni&s;h colour. Mo&s;t of them had pretty long beards. They had no or|naments about their per&s;ons, nor did we ob&s;erve that they had their cars perforated. Some of them were <HI>tatooed</HI> on the hands, or near the groin; and the pieces of cloth, which were worn by them round their middle, were curiou&s;ly coloured with white, black, and red. They &s;eemed to be mild and good-natured; and were furni&s;hed with no arms of any kind, except &s;ome &s;mall &s;tones, which they had manife&s;tly brought for their own de|fence; and the&s;e they threw into the &s;ea when they found that there was no occa&s;ion for them.</P>
<P><PB N="131" REF="030274_0575_0FE570824F5ED080">As we perceived no &s;igns of an anchoring-place at this ea&s;tern extremity of the i&s;land, we bore away to leeward, and ranged along the &s;outh-ea&s;t &s;ide, at the di&s;tance of about a mile and a half from the &s;hore. The canoes left us when we made &s;ail; but others came off, as we pro|ceeded along the coa&s;t, and brought with them pigs and &s;ome excellent potatoes, which they ex|changed for whatever we offered to them; and &s;everal &s;mall pigs were purcha&s;ed by us for a &s;ix-penny nail. We pa&s;&s;ed divers villages; &s;ome of which were &s;ituated near the &s;ea, and others fur|ther up the country. The inhabitants of all of them came in crowds to the &s;hore, and a&s;&s;embled on the elevated places to take a view of the &s;hips. On this &s;ide of the i&s;land the land ri&s;es in a gen|tle acclivity from the &s;ea to the bottom of the mountains, which occupy the central part of the country, except at one place near the ea&s;tern end, there they ri&s;e immediately from the &s;ea: they &s;eemed to be compo&s;ed of &s;tone, or rocks lying in horizontal <HI>&s;trata.</HI> We ob&s;erved a few trees about the villages; near which we could al&s;o di&s;cern &s;everal plantations of &s;ugar-canes and plantains. We continued to &s;ound, but did not &s;trike ground with a line of fifty fa|thoms, till we came abrea&s;t of a low point, near the north-we&s;t extremity of the i&s;land, where we found from twelve to fourteen fathoms, over a rocky bottom. Having pa&s;&s;ed this point, we
<PB N="132" REF="030274_0576_0FE570879BBF39C8">
met with twenty fathoms, then &s;ixteen, twelve, and at la&s;t five, over a bottom of &s;and. We &s;pent the night in &s;tanding off and on; and, the next morning, &s;tood in for the land. We were met by &s;everal canoes filled with natives, &s;ome of whom ventured to come on board.</P>
<P>None of the inhabitants we ever met with be|fore in any other i&s;land or country, were &s;o a&s;to|ni&s;hed as the&s;e people were, upon entering a &s;hip. Their eyes were ince&s;&s;antly roving from one ob|ject to another; and the wildne&s;s of their looks and ge&s;tures, fully indicated their perfect igno|rance with re&s;pect to every thing they &s;aw; and &s;trongly marked to us, that they had never, till the pre&s;ent time, been vi&s;ited by Europeans, nor been acquainted with any of our commodities, except iron. This metal, however, they had in all probability only heard of, or had perhaps known it in &s;ome incon&s;iderable quantity, brought to them at a remote period. They a&s;ked for it by the appellation of <HI>hamaite,</HI> referring probably to &s;ome in&s;trument, in making which iron could be &s;erviceably employed; for they applied that name to the blade of a knife, though they had no idea of that particular in&s;trument, which they could not even handle properly. They al&s;o fre|quently called iron by the name of <HI>toe,</HI> which &s;ignifies a hatchet, or adze. On our &s;hewing them &s;ome beads, they fir&s;t a&s;ked what they were; and then, whether they were to be eaten. But, on
<PB N="133" REF="030274_0577_0FE570898D9E2520">
their being informed, that they were to be hung in their ears, they rejected them as u&s;ele&s;s. They were equally indifferent with regard to a looking-gla&s;s that we offered them, and returned it for a &s;imilar rea&s;on. China cups, plates of earthen ware, and other things of that kind, were &s;o new to them, that they a&s;ked whether they were made of wood. They were, in many re&s;pects, natu|rally polite; or, at lea&s;t, cautious of giving offence. Some of them, ju&s;t before their ventur|ing on board, repeated a long prayer; and others, afterwards, &s;ung and made various motions with their hands. On their fir&s;t entering the &s;hips, they attempted to &s;teal every thing that they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> lay hands on, or rather to take it openly, as if they &s;uppo&s;ed that we either &s;hould not re&s;ent &s;uch behaviour, or not hinder it. But we &s;oon convinced them of their error; and when they ob&s;erved that we kept a watchful eye over them, they became le&s;s active in appropriating to them|&s;elves what did not belong to them.</P>
<P>About nine o'clock Captain Cook di&s;patched Lieutenant William&s;on, with three armed boats, to look out for a proper landing-place&punc; and for fre&s;h water; with orders, that, if he &s;hould find it nece&s;&s;ary to land in &s;earch of the letter, he &s;hould not allow more than one man to accom|pany him out of the boats. The very moment they were putting off from the &s;hip one of the i&s;landers having &s;tolen a cleaver, leaped over
<PB N="134" REF="030274_0578_0FE5708B14D8AF68">
board, got into his canoe, and ha&s;tened towards the &s;hore, while the boats pur&s;ued him in vain.</P>
<P>The rea&s;on of the Commodore's order that the crews of the boats &s;hould not go on &s;hore, was that he might prevent, if po&s;&s;ible, the importa|tion of dangerous di&s;ea&s;e into this i&s;land, which he knew &s;ome of our people now laboured under, and which we, unfortunately, had already com|municated to other i&s;lands in this ocean. From the &s;ame motive, he commanded that all female vi&s;itants &s;hould be excluded from both the &s;hips. Many per&s;ons of this &s;ex had come off in the ca|noes. Their features. complexion, and &s;tature, were not very different from tho&s;e of the men; and though their countenances were extremely open and agreeable, few traces of delicacy were vi&s;ible either in their faces, or other proportions. The only difference in their dre&s;s, was their hav|ing a piece of cloth about their bodies, reach|ing from near the middle almo&s;t down to the knees, in&s;tead of the <HI>maro</HI> worn by the male-&s;ex. They were as much inclined to favour us with their company on board, as &s;ome of the men were; but the Commodore was extremely de|&s;irous of preventing all connection, which might in all probability, convey an irreparable injury to them&s;elves, and afterwards, through their means, to the whole nation. Another pru|dent precaution was taken, by &s;trictly enjoin|ing, that no per&s;on capable of communicat|ing

the infection &s;hould be &s;ent upon duty out of the &s;hips.</P>
<P>Captain Cook had paid equal attention to the &s;ame object, when he fir&s;t vi&s;ited the Friendly I&s;les; but he afterwards found, to his great re|gret, that his endeavours had not &s;ucceeded. And there is rea&s;on to apprehend, that this will con&s;tantly be the ca&s;e, in &s;uch voyages as ours, whenever it is nece&s;&s;ary that many people &s;hould be employed on &s;hore. The opportunities and incitements to an amorous intercour&s;e are then too numerous to be effectually guarded again&s;t; and however confident a commander may be of the health of his men, he is often undeceived too late, Among a number of men, there are in general to be found &s;ome, who, out of ba&s;hfulne&s;s, en|deavour to conceal their having any venereal &s;ymptoms: and there are others &s;o pro&s;ligate and abandoned, as not to care to whom they com|municate this di&s;ea&s;e. We had an in&s;tance of the la&s;t remark at Tongataboo, in the gunner of the Di&s;covery, who had been &s;tationed on &s;hore. After knowing that he had contracted this di&s;|order, he continued to have connections with dif|ferent women, who were &s;uppo&s;ed to have been, till that time, free from any infection. His com|panions remon&s;trated to him on this &s;candalous behaviour without effect, till Captain Clerke, being informed of &s;uch a dangerous irregularity of conduct, ordered him to repair on board.</P>
<P><PB N="136" REF="030274_0580_0FE57092F993E9F8">Waiting for the return of our boats, which had been &s;ent out to reconnoitre the coa&s;t, we &s;tood off and on with the &s;hips. Towards mid-day, Mr William&s;on came back, and reported, that he had ob&s;erved behind a beach, near one of the villages, a large pond, which was &s;aid by the na|tives to contain fre&s;h water; and that there was tolerable anchoring-ground before it. He al&s;o mentioned, that he had made an attempt to land in another place, but was prevented by the i&s;lan|ders, who, coming down in great numbers to the boats, endeavoured to take away the oars, mu&s;quets, and every other article which they could lay hold of; and crowded &s;o thick upon him and his people, that he was under the nece&s;|&s;ity of firing, by which one man was killed. This unfortunate circum&s;tance, however, was not known to Captain Cook till after we had quit|ted the i&s;land; &s;o that all his mea&s;ures were di|rected as if no affair of that kind had happened, Mr. William&s;on informed him, that, as &s;oon as the man fell, he was taken up and carried off by his countrymen, who then retired from the boats, but &s;till they made &s;ignals for our people to land, which they declined. It did not appear, that the natives had the lea&s;t intention of killing, or even hurting, any of Mr. Willim&s;on's party; but they &s;eemed to have been excited by curio|&s;ity alone, to get from them what they had, be|ing
<PB N="137" REF="030274_0581_0FE57094837325F0">
prepared to give, in return, any thing that appertained to them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Captain Cook then di&s;patched one of the boats to lie in the be&s;t anchoring-ground; and when &s;he had gained this nation, he bore down with the &s;hips, and ca&s;t anchor in twenty-five fathoms water, over a &s;andy bottom. The ea&s;tern point of the road, which was the low point already men|tioned, bore &s;outh 51&deg; ea&s;t; the we&s;t point, north 65&deg; we&s;t; and the village near which the fre&s;h wa|ter was &s;aid to be, was one mile di&s;tant. The &s;hips being thus &s;tationed, between three and four in the afternoon, the Captain went a&s;hore with three armed boats, and twelve of the ma|rines, with a view of examining the water, and trying the di&s;po&s;ition of the inhabitants who had a&s;&s;embled in con&s;iderable numbers on a &s;andy beach before the village; behind it was a valley, in which was the piece of water. The moment he leaped on &s;hore, all the i&s;landers fell pro&s;trate upon their faces, and continued in that po&s;ture of humiliation, till, by &s;igns, he prevailed on them to ri&s;e. They then pre&s;ented to him many &s;mall pigs, with plantain-trees, making u&s;e of nearly the &s;ame ceremonies which we had &s;een practi&s;ed, on &s;imilar occa&s;ions, at the Society and other i&s;les: and a long oration or prayer being pronounced by an individual, in which others of the a&s;&s;em|bly occa&s;ionally joined. Captain Cook &s;ignified his acceptance of their proffered friend&s;hip, by
<PB N="138" REF="030274_0582_0FE57096095E6060">
be&s;towing on them, in return &s;uch pre&s;ents a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> he had brought a&s;hore&punc; This introductory bu&s;i|ne&s;s being ended, he &s;tationed a guard upon the beach, and was then conducted by &s;ome of the natives to the water, which he found extremely good, and &s;o con&s;iderable, that it might be de|nominated a lake. After this, he returned on board, and i&s;&s;ued orders that preparations &s;hould be made for filling our water-ca&s;ks in the morn|ing; at which time he went a&s;hore with &s;ome of his people, having a party of marines for the guard.</P>
<P>They had no &s;ooner landed, than a trade was entered into for potatoes and hogs, which the i&s;landers gave in exchange for nails and pieces of iron. But from giving any ob&s;truction to our men who were occupied in watering, they even a&s;&s;i&s;ted them in rolling the ca&s;ks to and from the pool, and performed with alacrity whatever was required of them. Captain Cook leaving the command at this &s;tation to Mr. William&s;on, who had landed with him, made an excu&s;iron into the country, up in the valley, being accompanied by Me&s;&s;rs. Ander&s;on and Webber, and followed by a numerous train of natives, one of whom, who had been very active in keeping the others in order, the Captain made choice of as a guide. This, man, from time to time, proclaiming the approach of our gentlemen, every per&s;on who met them, full pro&s;trate on the ground, and re|mained in that humble po&s;ition till they had
<PB N="139" REF="030274_0583_0FE57097E3593D78">
pa&s;&s;ed. This, as we were afterwards informed, is their method of &s;hewing re&s;pect to their own great chiefs.</P>
<P>We had ob&s;erved at every village, as we ranged along the coa&s;t in the &s;hips, one or more ele|vated white objects, re&s;embling pyramids, or ra|ther obeli&s;ks; one of which, &s;uppo&s;ed by Cap|tain Cook to be at lea&s;t fifty feet in height, was very con&s;picuous from our anchoring-&s;tation, and &s;eemed to be at a &s;mall di&s;tance up this valley. To have a nearer view of it, was the principal motive of our gentlemen's walk. Their guide was accquainted with their de&s;ire of being conducted to it: but it happened to be in &s;uch a &s;ituation, that they could not get at it, the pool of water &s;eparating it from them. However, as there was another of the &s;ame kind about half a mile di&s;|tant, upon their &s;ide of the valley, they &s;et out to vi&s;it that. As &s;oon as they reached it, they perceived that it was &s;ituate in a burying-ground, or <HI>morai,</HI> which bore a &s;triking re&s;emblance, in &s;everal re&s;pects, to tho&s;e they had &s;een at Ota|heite and other i&s;lands in this ocean. It was an oblong &s;pace, of con&s;iderable extent, environed by a &s;tone-wall, four or five feet high. The inclo&s;ed &s;pace was loo&s;ely paved; and, at one end of it, was placed the obeli&s;k or pyramid, called by the natives <HI>henananoo,</HI> which was an exact model of the larger one that we had di&s;|cerned from our &s;hips. It was about twenty feet
<PB N="140" REF="030274_0584_0FE5709C6E1F4428">
in height, and four feet &s;quare at the ba&s;e. Its four &s;ides were formed of &s;mall poles interwoven with twigs and branches, thus compo&s;ing an in|different wicker-work, hollow within from the top to the bottom. It appeared to be in a ruin|ous &s;tate, and had been originally covered with a thin greyi&s;h cloth. On each &s;ide of it were long pieces of wicker-work, termed <HI>herecane,</HI> in a con|dition equally ruinous, with two poles inclining towards each other at one corner, where &s;ome plantains were placed on a board, fixed at the height of about half a dozen feet. This was called by the i&s;landers <HI>herairemy</HI>; and they &s;aid&punc; that the fruit was an offering to their deity. Before the <HI>henananoo</HI> were &s;everal pieces of wood, carv|ed into &s;ome re&s;emblance of human figures. There was al&s;o a &s;tone near two feet in height covered with cloth. Adjoining to this, on the out&s;ide of the <HI>morai,</HI> was a &s;mall &s;hed, which they denominated <HI>hareepahoo</HI>; and before it there was a grave, where the remains of a woman had been depo&s;ited.</P>
<P>There was a hou&s;e or &s;hed, called <HI>hemanaa,</HI> on the further &s;ide of the area of the <HI>morai:</HI> it was about forty feet in length, ten or eleven feet in height, and ten in breadth in the middle, but narrower at each end; though con&s;iderably longer, it was lower than their common habita|tions. Oppo&s;ite the entrance into this hou&s;e, &s;tood two images near three feet high, cut out of

<PB N="141" REF="030274_0586_0FE5709DF91119B0">
one piece of wood, with pede&s;tals: they were &s;aid to be <HI>Eatooa no Veheina,</HI> or repre&s;entations of godde&s;&s;es, and were not very indifferent either in point of execution or de&s;ign. On the head of one of them was a cylindrical cap, not unlike the head-dre&s;s at Otaheite, called <HI>tomou;</HI> and on that of the other, a carved helmet, &s;omewhat re&s;em|bling tho&s;e of the ancient warriors; and both of them had pieces of cloth fa&s;tened about the loins, and hanging down a con&s;iderable way. There was al&s;o, at the &s;ide of, each, a piece of carved wood, with cloth hung on it. Before the pe|de&s;tals lay a quantity of fern, which had been placed there at different times. In the middle of the hou&s;e, and before the images ju&s;t de&s;cribed, was an oblong &s;pace, inclo&s;ed by an edging of &s;tone, and covered with &s;hreds of cloth; this was the grave of &s;even chiefs, and was called <HI>heneene.</HI></P>
<P>Our gentlemen had already met with &s;o many in&s;tances of re&s;emblance, between the <HI>morai</HI> they were now vi&s;iting, and tho&s;e of the i&s;lands they had lately quitted, that they entertained little doubt in their minds, that the &s;imilarity exi&s;ted al&s;o, in the rites here &s;olemnized, and particularly in the horrid oblation of human victims. Their &s;u&s;picions were &s;oon confirmed; for, on one &s;ide of the entrance into the <HI>hemannaa,</HI> they ob&s;erved a &s;mall &s;quare place, and another &s;till &s;maller and on a&s;king what the&s;e were, they were inform|ed by their conductor, that in one of them was
<PB N="142" REF="030274_0587_0FE5709FB784F788">
interred a man who had been &s;acrificed; and in the other, a hog, which had al&s;o been offered up to the deity. At no great di&s;tance from the&s;e, were three other &s;quare inclo&s;ed places, with two pieces of carved wood at each of them, and a heap of fern upon them. The&s;e were the graves of three chiefs; and before them was an inclo&s;ed &s;pace of an oblong figure, called <HI>Tangata-taboo</HI> by our gentlemen's guide, who declared to them, that three human &s;acrifices, one at the funeral of each chief, had been there buried.</P>
<P>Every appearance induced the Commodore to believe, that this inhuman practice was very ge|neral here. The i&s;land &s;eemed to abound with &s;uch places of &s;acrifice as this, at which he was now pre&s;ent, and which was probably one of the mo&s;t incon&s;iderable of them; being much le&s;s con&s;picuous than &s;ome others which we had ob|&s;erved as we &s;ailed along the coa&s;t, and particu|larly than that on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the piece of water running through this valley; the white py|ramid of which, in all probability, derived its colour &s;olely from the con&s;ecrated cloth put over it. In many &s;pots within this burying-ground, were planted trees of the <HI>morinda citrifolia,</HI> and <HI>cordia &s;ebe&s;tina,</HI> be&s;ides &s;everal plants of the <HI>etee,</HI> with the leaves of which the <HI>hemanaa</HI> was thatched.</P>
<P>The journey of our gentlemen to and from this <HI>morai,</HI> lay through the plantations. Mo&s;t of the ground was perfectly flat, with ditches in|ter&s;ecting
<PB N="143" REF="030274_0588_0FE570A18F56CDB8">
different parts, and roads that &s;eemed to have been rai&s;ed to &s;ome height by art. The intervening &s;paces, in general, were planted with <HI>taro,</HI> which grew with great vigour. There were &s;everal &s;pots where the cloth-mulberry was plant|ed in regular rows; this al&s;o grew vigorou&s;ly. The cocoa-trees were in a le&s;s thriving condition, and were all low; but the plantain-trees, though not large, made a pretty good appearance. Upon the whole, the trees that are mo&s;t numerous around this village, are the <HI>cordia &s;eba&s;tina.</HI> The greate&s;t part of it is &s;ituate near the beach, and con&s;i&s;ts of upwards of &s;ixty hou&s;es there; but there may perhaps be near forty more &s;cattered about, towards the <HI>morai.</HI></P>
<P>After the Commodore, and Me&s;&s;rs. Ander&s;on and Webber, had carefully examined whatever was worthy of notice about the <HI>morai,</HI> and the latter had taken drawings of it, and of the &s;ur|rounding country, they returned by a different route. They found a multitude of people col|lected at the beach, and a bri&s;k trade for fowls, pigs, and vegetables, going on there, with the greate&s;t order and decorum. At noon, Captain Cook went on board to dinner, and then &s;ent Mr. King to take the command of the party on &s;hore. During the afternoon he landed again, accompanied by Captain Clerke, intending to make another excur&s;ion up the country: but, be|fore he could execute this de&s;ign, the day was
<PB N="144" REF="030274_0589_0FE570A7001721E0">
too far advanced; he therefore relinqui&s;hed his intention for the pre&s;ent, and no other opportu|nity afterwards occurred. Towards &s;un-&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t, he and his people returned on board, after having procured, in the cour&s;e of this day, nine tons of water, and (principally by exchanging nails and pieces of iron) &s;eventy or eighty pigs, &s;ome fowls, plantains, potatoes, and <HI>taro</HI> roots. In this com|mercial intercour&s;e, the i&s;landers de&s;erved our be&s;t commendations, making no attempts to cheat us, either along-&s;ide our &s;hips, or on &s;hore. Some of them, indeed, as we have already related, betrayed at fir&s;t; a pilfering di&s;po&s;ition; or, per|haps, they imagined that they had a right to all they could lay their hands upon: but they quick|ly de&s;i&s;ted from a conduct, which, we convinced them, could not be per&s;evered in with impunity.</P>
<P>Among the various articles which they brought to barter this day, we were particularly &s;truck with a &s;ort of cloak and cap, which, even in more poli&s;hed countries, might be e&s;teemed elegant. The&s;e cloaks are nearly of the &s;hape and &s;ize of the &s;hort ones worn by the men in Spain, and by the women in England, tied loo&s;ely before, and reaching to the middle of the back. The ground of them is a net-work, with the mo&s;t beautiful red and yellow feathers &s;o clo&s;ely fixed upon it, that the &s;urface, both in point of &s;mooth|ne&s;s and glo&s;&s;ine&s;s, re&s;embles the riche&s;t velvet. The method of varying the mixture is very dif|ferent;
<PB N="145" REF="030274_0590_0FE570A88927EAF8">
&s;ome of them having triangular &s;paces of yellow and red alternately; others, a &s;ort of cre&s;cent; while &s;ome, were entirely red, except that they had a broad yellow border. The bril|liant colours of the feathers, in tho&s;e cloaks that were new, had a very fine effect. The natives, at fir&s;t, refu&s;ed to part with one of the&s;e cloaks for any thing that we offered in exchange, de|manding no le&s;s a price than one of our mu&s;quets. They afterwards, however, &s;uffered us to pur|cha&s;e &s;ome of them for very large nails. Tho&s;e of the be&s;t &s;ort were &s;carce; and it is probable, that they are u&s;ed only on particular occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>The caps are made in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> form of a helmet, with the middle part, or cre&s;t, frequently of a hand's breadth. They &s;it very clo&s;e upon the head, and have notches to admit the ears. They con&s;i&s;t of twigs and o&s;iers, covered with a net|work, into which feathers are wrought, as upon the cloaks, but &s;omewhat clo&s;er, and le&s;s diver|&s;ified; the major part being red, with &s;ome yel|low, green, or black &s;tripes, on the &s;ides. The&s;e caps, in all probability, complete the dre&s;s, with the cloaks; for the i&s;landers appeared, &s;ome|times, in both together.</P>
<P>We could not conjecture from whence they obtained &s;uch a quantity of the&s;e beautiful fea|thers; but we &s;oon procured intelligence re&s;pect|ing one &s;ort; for they afterwards brought for &s;ale great numbers of &s;kins of a &s;mall read &s;pecies of
<PB N="146" REF="030274_0591_0FE570AA11481668">
birds, frequently tied up in bunches of twenty or upwards, or having a wooden &s;kewer run through them. At fir&s;t, tho&s;e that were purcha&s;ed, con|&s;i&s;ted only of the &s;kin from behind the wings for|ward; but we afterwards obtained many with the hind part, including the feet and tail. The for|mer in&s;tantly &s;ugge&s;ted to us the origin of the fable of the birds of paradi&s;e being de&s;titute of legs; and &s;ufficiently explained that particular. The rea&s;on a&s;&s;igned by the inhabitants of Atooi for the cu&s;tom of cutting off the feet of the&s;e birds, is, that by this practice they can pre&s;erve them the more ea&s;ily, without lo&s;ing any part which they con&s;ider as valuable.</P>
<P>The red-bird of this i&s;land was, according to Mr. Ander&s;on, a &s;pecies of <HI>merops,</HI> about as large as a &s;parrow, its colour was a beautiful &s;carlet, with the tale and wings black; and it had an arched bill, twice as long as the head, which with the feet, was of a reddi&s;h hue. The con|tents of the heads were taken out, as in the birds of paradi&s;e, but we did not find, that they prac|ti&s;ed any other mode of pre&s;erving them, than &s;imple drying; for the &s;kins, though they were moi&s;t, had neither a &s;mell nor ta&s;te that could give any rea&s;on for &s;u&s;pecting the u&s;e of anti-pu|tre&s;cent &s;ub&s;tances.</P>
<P>On Thur&s;day the 22d, we had almo&s;t conti|nual rain for the whole morning. The wind was at &s;outh-ea&s;t, &s;outh-&s;outh-ea&s;t, and &s;outh; and
<PB N="147" REF="030274_0592_0FE570AB9DE4F440">
the &s;urf broke &s;o high upon the &s;hore, that our boats were prevented from landing. The Re&s;o|lution was not in a very &s;ecure &s;ituation, there being breakers within the length of little more than two cables from her &s;tern. The natives, notwith&s;tanding the &s;urf, ventured out in their canoes, bringing off to our &s;hips, hogs and ve|getables, which they exchanged, as before, for our commodities. One of their number, who offered &s;ome fi&s;h-hooks for &s;ale, was ob&s;erved to have a very &s;mall parcel, fa&s;tened to the &s;tring of one of them, which he carefully &s;eparated, and re&s;erved for him&s;elf, when he di&s;po&s;ed of the hook. When a&s;ked what it was, he pointed to his belly, and intimated &s;omething of its being dead; &s;aying, at the &s;ame time, that it was bad. He was reque&s;ted to open the parcel, which he did with great reluctance; and we found, that it contained a &s;mall thin piece of fle&s;h, which had, to all appearance, been dried, but was at pre&s;ent wet with &s;alt water. Imagining that it might be human fle&s;h, we put the que&s;tion to the producer of it, who an&s;wered, that the fle&s;h was part of a man. Another of the i&s;landers, who &s;tood near him, was then a&s;ked, whether it was a cu&s;tom among them to eat their enemies who had been &s;lain in battle; and he immediately replied in the affirmative.</P>
<P>In the afternoon, we had &s;ome intervals of fair weather. The wind then changed to the ea&s;t
<PB N="148" REF="030274_0593_0FE570B0CC1C8A48">
and north-ea&s;t; but, towards the evening, it veered back again to &s;outh-&s;outh-ea&s;t. The rain al&s;o returning continued the whole night, but was not accompanied with much wind. At &s;even the next morning, a north-ea&s;terly breeze &s;pring|ing up, Captain Cook ordered the anchors of his &s;hip to be taken up, with a view of removing her further out. As &s;oon as the la&s;t anchor was up, the wind, veering to the ea&s;t, rendered it nece&s;&s;ary to make all the &s;ail he could, for the purpo&s;e of clearing the &s;hore; &s;o that, before he had good &s;ea-room, he was driven con&s;iderably to leeward. He endeavoured to regain the road; but having a &s;trong current again&s;t him, and very little wind, he could not accompli&s;h that de&s;ign. He therefore di&s;patched Me&s;&s;rs. King and Wil|liam&s;on a&s;hore, with three boats, to procure water and refre&s;hments, &s;ending, at the &s;ame time, an order to Captain Clerke, to put to &s;ea after him, if he &s;hould find that the Re&s;olution was unable to recover the road.</P>
<P>The Commodore having hopes of finding a road, or perhaps a harbour, at the we&s;t end of the i&s;land, was the le&s;s anxious about regaining his former &s;tation. But as he had &s;ent the boats thither, he kept as much as po&s;&s;ible to wind|ward; notwith&s;tanding which, at noon, our &s;hip was three leagues to leeward. As we approached the we&s;t end, we found that the coa&s;t rounded gradually to the north-ea&s;t, without forming a
<PB N="149" REF="030274_0594_0FE570B27A73E5D0">
cove, or creek, wherein a ve&s;&s;el might be &s;hel|tered from the violence of the &s;well, which, roll|ing in from the northward, broke again&s;t the &s;hore in an amazing &s;urf: all hopes, therefore, of meeting with a harbour here &s;oon vani&s;hed. Many of the natives, in their canoes, followed us as we &s;tood out to &s;ea, bartering various arti|cles. As we were extremely unwilling, notwith|&s;tanding the &s;u&s;picious circum&s;tance of the pre|ceding day, to believe that the&s;e people were cannibals, we now made &s;ome further enquiries on this &s;ubject. A &s;mall in&s;trument of wood, be&s;et with &s;harks teeth, had been purcha&s;ed; which as it re&s;embled the &s;aw or knife made u&s;e of by the &s;avages of New-Zealand to di&s;&s;ect the bodies of their enemies, was &s;u&s;pected by us to be employed here for the &s;ame purpo&s;e. One of the i&s;landers being que&s;tioned on this point, in|formed us that the in&s;trument above-mentioned &s;erved the purpo&s;e of cutting out the fle&s;hy part of the belly, when any per&s;on was &s;lain. This explained and confirmed the circum&s;tance before related, of the man's pointing to his belly. The native, however, from whom we now received this intelligence, being a&s;ked whether his coun|trymen eat the part thus cut out, &s;trongly denied it; but, when the que&s;tion was repeated, he &s;hewed &s;ome degree of apprehen&s;ion, and &s;wam off to his canoe. An elderly man, who &s;at fore|mo&s;t in the canoe, was then a&s;ked whether they
<PB N="150" REF="030274_0595_0FE570B4068A29F0">
eat the fle&s;h; and he an&s;wered in the affirmative. The que&s;tion being put to him a &s;econd time, he again affirmed the fact; adding, that it was &s;avoury food.</P>
<P>The boats returned about &s;even o'clock in the evening, with a few hogs, &s;ome plantains and roots, and two tuns of water. Mr. King report|ed to the Commodore, that the i&s;landers were very numerous at the watering-place, and had brought great numbers of hogs to barter; but our people had not commodities with them ade|quate to the purcha&s;e of them all. He al&s;o men|tioned, that the &s;urf had run &s;o very high, that it was with extreme difficulty our men landed, and afterwards got back into the boats.</P>
<P>On Saturday the 24th, at day-break, we found that our &s;hip had been carried by the currents to the north-we&s;t and north; &s;o that the we&s;tern ex|tremity of Atooi bore ea&s;t, at the di&s;tance of one league. A northerly breeze &s;prung up &s;oon after, and Captain Cook expecting that this would bring the Di&s;covery to &s;ea, &s;teered for Oneeheow, a neighbouring i&s;land, which then bore &s;outh-we&s;t, with a view of anchoring there. He continued to &s;teer for it till pa&s;t eleven, at which time he was at the di&s;tance of about &s;ix miles from it. But not &s;eeing the Di&s;covery, he was apprehen|&s;ive le&s;t &s;ome ill con&s;equence might ari&s;e from our &s;eparating &s;o far; he therefore relinqui&s;hed the de&s;ign of vi&s;iting Oneeheow for the pre&s;ent,
<PB N="151" REF="030274_0596_0FE570B5E2D55BC0">
and &s;tood back to Atooi, intending to ca&s;t anchor again in the road, in order to complete our &s;up|ply of water. At two o'clock, the northerly wind was &s;ucceeded by calms and variable light airs, which continued till eleven at night. We &s;tretched to the &s;outh-ea&s;t, till early in the morn|ing of the 25th, when we tacked and &s;tood in for Atooi road; and, not long after, we were joined by the Di&s;covery. We were utterly unable to regain the road; and, by the morning of the 29th, the currents had carried us to the we&s;t|ward, within nine or ten miles of Oneeheow. Weary with plying &s;o un&s;ucce&s;sfully, Captain Cook laid a&s;ide all thoughts of returning to Atooi and re&s;umed his intention of paying a vi&s;it to Oneeheow. With this view, he di&s;patched the ma&s;ter in a boat, to found along the coa&s;t, and &s;earch for a landing-place, and afterwards for fre&s;h water. In the mean time, the &s;hips follow|ed under an ea&s;y &s;ail. The ma&s;ter, at his re|turn reported, that there was tolerable anchorage all along the coa&s;t; and that he had landed in one place, but could not find any fre&s;h water.</P>
<P>Captain Cook being informed by &s;ome of the natives, who had come off to the &s;hips, that fre&s;h water might be obtained at a village which we &s;aw at a little di&s;tance, run down, and ca&s;t an|chor before it, about &s;ix furlongs from the &s;hore, the depth of water being twenty-&s;ix fathoms. The Di&s;covery anchored at a greater di&s;tance
<PB N="152" REF="030274_0597_0FE570BA852DE998">
from the &s;hore, in twenty-three fathoms. The &s;outh-ea&s;tern point of Oneeheow bore &s;outh, 65&deg; ea&s;t, about one league di&s;tant; and another i&s;land which we had di&s;covered the preceding night, named Tahoora, bore &s;outh, 61&deg; we&s;t, at the di&s;|tance of &s;even leagues. Before we anchored, &s;e|veral canoes had come off to us, bringing pota|toes, yams, and &s;mall pigs, be&s;ides mats. The people who were in them re&s;embled in their per|&s;ons the inhabitants of Atooi; and like them, were acquainted with the u&s;e of iron, which they a&s;ked for by the name of <HI>toe</HI> and <HI>hamaite,</HI> readily parting with all their commodities for pieces of this metal. Some more canoes &s;oon reached our &s;hips, after they had come to anchor; but the i&s;landers who were in the&s;e had apparently no other object, than to make us a formal vi&s;it. Many of them came on board, and crouched down upon the deck; nor did they quit that humble po&s;ture, till they were reque&s;ted to ri&s;e. Several women, whom they had brought with them, remained along-&s;ide in the canoes, behav|ing with much le&s;s mode&s;ty than the females of Atooi; and, at intervals, they all joined in a &s;ong, which, though not very melodious, was performed in the exacte&s;t concert, by beating time upon their brea&s;ts with their hands. The men who had come on board did not continue long with us; and before their departure, &s;ome of
<PB N="153" REF="030274_0598_0FE548B4E7D35000">
them de&s;ired permi&s;&s;ion to lay down locks of their hair on the deck.</P>
<P>The curious enquiry, whether the&s;e i&s;landers were cannibals, was this day renewed, and the &s;ubject did not ari&s;e from any que&s;tions put by us, but from a circum&s;tance that &s;eemed to remove all doubt. One of the natives, who wi&s;hed to get in at the gun-room port, was refu&s;ed; and he then a&s;ked, whether we &s;hould kill and eat him, if he &s;hould come in? accompanying this que&s;tion with &s;igns &s;o expre&s;&s;ive, that we did not entertain a doubt with re&s;pect to his meaning. We had now an opportunity of retorting the que&s;tion as to this practice; and a man behind the other, in the canoe, in&s;tantly replied, that, if we were killed on &s;hore, they would not &s;cruple to eat us not that he meant they would de&s;troy us for that purpo&s;e, but that their devouring us would be the con&s;equence of our being at enmity with them.</P>
<P>Mr. Gore was &s;ent in the afternoon, with three armed boats, in &s;earch of the mo&s;t commodious landing-place; being al&s;o directed to look for fre&s;h water when he &s;hould get on &s;hore. He returned in the evening, and reported to Captain Cook, that he had landed at the village above-mentioned, and had been conducted to a well about half a mile up the country; but that the water which it contained was in too &s;mall a quan|tity for our purpo&s;e, and the road that led to it
<PB N="154" REF="030274_0599_0FE570BC0CA7CEA0">
was extremely bad. The next day Mr. Gore was &s;ent a&s;hore again, with a guard, and a party to trade with the inhabitants for refre&s;hments. The Commodore's intention was to have followed &s;oon afterwards; and he went from the &s;hip with that de&s;ign. But the &s;urf had &s;o greatly increa&s;ed by this time, that he was apprehen&s;ive, if he got a&s;hore, he &s;hould not be able to make his way back again. This circum&s;tance really happened to our people who had landed with Mr. Gore; for the communication between them and the &s;hips, by our own boats, was quickly &s;topped. They made a &s;ignal&punc; in the evening, for the boats, which were accordingly &s;ent; and, in a &s;hort time afterwards, returned with &s;ome good &s;alt and a few yams. A con&s;iderable quantity of both the&s;e articles had been obtained in the cour&s;e of the day; but the &s;urf was &s;o exceedingly high, that the greate&s;t part of both had bee lo&s;t in bringing them off to the boats. The officer and twenty men, not venturing to run the ri&s;que of coming off, rem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ined all night on &s;hore; by which unfor|tunate circum&s;tance, the very thing happened which Captain Cook, as we have already related, &s;o eagarly wi&s;hed to prevent, and imagined he had effectually guarded again&s;t.</P>
<P>The violence of the &s;urf did not deter the na|tives from coming off in canoes to our &s;hips. They brought with them &s;ome refre&s;hments, for which we gave them, in exchange, &s;ome nails,
<PB N="155" REF="030274_0600_0FE570BD92C8EA08">
and pieces of iron hoops; and we di&s;tributed among the woman in the canoes, many pieces of ribbon, and &s;ome buttons, as bracelets. Some of the men had repre&s;entations of human figures punctured upon their brea&s;ts, and one of them had a lizard repre&s;ented. The&s;e vi&s;itants ac|quainted us, that there was no chief of this i&s;land, but that it was &s;ubject to one of the chiefs of Atooi, who&s;e name was Teneooneoo. Among other articles which they now brought off to us, was a &s;mall drum, that had a great re&s;emblance to tho&s;e of Otaheite.</P>
<P>Between ten and eleven o'clock at night, the wind became &s;outherly, and the &s;ky &s;eemed to in|dicate an approaching &s;torm. In con&s;equence of the&s;e threatening appearances, Captain Cook, thinking that we were rather too near the &s;hore, cau&s;ed the anchors to be taken up; and the &s;hips being carried into forty-two fathoms water, came to again in that more &s;ecure &s;tation. This, how|ever, proved an unnece&s;&s;ary precaution; for the wind, not long after, veering to north-north-ea&s;t, blew a fre&s;h gale, with &s;qualls, and violent &s;howers of rain. This weather continued for the whole &s;ucceeding day, during which the &s;ea ran &s;o high, that all communication with our party on &s;hore was totally intercepted, and the i&s;landers them|&s;elves would not venture out to the &s;hips in their canoes. Towards the evening, the Commodore &s;ent the ma&s;ter in a boat to the &s;outh-ea&s;t point
<PB N="156" REF="030274_0601_0FE570BF6B800838">
of the i&s;land, to try whether he could land in that quarter. He returned with a favourable re|port; but it was now too late to &s;end for our party till the following morning; &s;o that they were obliged to &s;tay another night on &s;hore. On the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ppearance of day-light, a boat was di&s;patched to the &s;outh-ea&s;t point, with orders to Lieutenant Gore, that, if he could not embark his people from the &s;pot where they at pre&s;ent were, he &s;hould march them up to the point. The boat be|ing prevented from getting to the beach, one of the crew &s;wam to &s;hore, and communicated the in&s;tructions. After the boat had returned, Captain Cook went him&s;elf with the launch and pinnace up to the point, in order to bring off our party from the land. He took with him three goats, one of them a male, and the others female; a young boar and &s;ow of the Engli&s;h breed; and al&s;o the &s;eeds of onions, pumpkins and melons. He landed, with great ea&s;e, under the we&s;t &s;ide of the point, where he found his party, in com|pany with &s;ome of the natives. To one of the&s;e, who a&s;&s;umed &s;ome degree of authority over the re&s;t, he gave the goats, pigs, and &s;eeds. He in|tended to have left the&s;e u&s;eful pre&s;ents at Atooi. if we had not been &s;o unexpectedly driven from that i&s;land.</P>
<P>While our people were employed in filling &s;ome water-ca&s;ks, from a little &s;tream which the late rains had occa&s;ioned, Captain Cook made a
<PB N="157" REF="030274_0602_0FE570C4215101C8">
&s;hort excur&s;ion into the country, accompanied by the i&s;lander above-mentioned, and followed by two others who carried the two pigs. When they had arrived upon a ri&s;ing ground, the Captain &s;topped to look around him, and immediately ob&s;erved a woman, on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the valley in which he had landed, calling out to her countrymen who attended him. Upon this the man who acted as chief began to mutter &s;omething as if he was praying; and the two bearers of the pigs continued walking round the Captain all the time, making about a dozen circuits before the other had made an end of his ori&s;on. This &s;trange ceremony being performed, they pro|ceeded on their walk, and met people coming from all quarters, who, upon being called to by the Captain's attendants, fell pro&s;trate on their faces, till he was out of &s;ight. The ground over which he pa&s;&s;ed, though it was uncultivated and very &s;tony, was covered with plants and &s;hrubs, &s;ome of which perfumed the air with the mo&s;t delicious fragrance.</P>
<P>Our party who had been detained &s;o long on &s;hore, found, in tho&s;e parts of the i&s;land which they had traver&s;ed, &s;everal &s;alt ponds, &s;ome of which had a &s;mall quantity of water remaining, but others had none. They &s;aw no appearance of a running &s;tream; and though, in &s;ome &s;mall wells which they met with, the fre&s;h water was pretty good, it &s;eemed to be &s;carce. The hou&s;es
<PB N="158" REF="030274_0603_0FE570C5B7860510">
of the natives were thinly &s;cattered about; and it was &s;uppo&s;ed, that there were not more than five hundred per&s;ons in the whole i&s;land. The me|thod of living among the&s;e people was decent and cleanly. No in&s;tance was ob&s;erved of the men and women eating together; and the latter &s;eemed in general to be a&s;&s;ociated in companies by them|&s;elves. The oily nuts of the <HI>dooe dooe</HI> are burned by the&s;e i&s;landers for lights during the night; and they dre&s;s their hogs by baking them in ovens, &s;plitting the carca&s;es through the whole length. Our people met with a &s;ufficient proof of the ex|i&s;tence of the <HI>taboo</HI> among them; for one woman was employed in feeding another who was under that interdiction. Several other my&s;terious cere|monies were al&s;o ob&s;erved; one of which was per|formed by a woman, who threw a pig into the &s;urf, and drowned it, and then tied up a bundle of wood, which &s;he di&s;po&s;ed of in the like man|ner. The &s;ame female, at another time, beat a man's &s;houlders with a &s;tick, after he had &s;eated him&s;elf for that purpo&s;e. An extraordinary ve|neration &s;eemed to be paid here to owls, which they keep very tame. It appeared to be a pretty general practice among them, to pull out one of their teeth; and when they were a&s;ked the rea&s;on of this remarkable cu&s;tom, the only an&s;wer they gave was, that it was <HI>teeha;</HI> which was al&s;o the rea&s;on a&s;&s;igned by them for giving a lock of their hair.</P>
<P><PB N="159" REF="030274_0604_0FE570C74310DDC8">After our water-ca&s;ks had been filled, and &s;ome roots, &s;alt, and &s;alted fi&s;h, had been purcha&s;ed from the natives, Captain Cook returned on board with all his people, intending to make another vi&s;it to the I&s;land the next day. But, about &s;even in the evening, the anchor of the Re&s;olution &s;tarted, &s;o that &s;he drove off the bank. By this accident, we found our&s;elves, at day break the next morning, which was the 2d of February, nine miles to the leeward of our la&s;t &s;tation; and the Captain fore&s;eeing that it would require more time to regain it than he cho&s;e to employ, made the &s;ignal for the Di&s;covery, to weigh anchor and join us. This junction was effected about noon; and both &s;hips immediately directed their cour&s;e to the northward, in pro&s;ecution of their voyage. Thus, after we had &s;pent more time in the neigh|bourhood of the&s;e i&s;lands than was nece&s;&s;ary to have an&s;wered all our purpo&s;es, we were obliged to quit them before we had completed our &s;tock of water, or procured from them &s;uch a plentiful &s;upply of refre&s;hments as the natives were both able and willing to have furni&s;hed us with. Our &s;hip, however, obtained from them provi&s;ions that la&s;ted at lea&s;t three weeks; and Captain Clerke, more fortunate than we were, acquired &s;uch a quantity of vegetables, as &s;ufficed the Di&s;|covery's people upwards of two months.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE i&s;lands in the Pacific Ocean, which have been di&s;covered in the cour&s;e of our ate voyages, have been generally found &s;ituate a groups; the &s;ingle intermediate i&s;les, hitherto
<PB N="161" REF="030274_0606_0FE548B2D59711B0">
met with, being few in proportion to the re&s;t; though, in all probability, there are many more of them yet unknown, which &s;erve as gradations or &s;teps between the &s;everal clu&s;ters. Of what number this new-di&s;covered Archipelago is com|po&s;ed, mu&s;t be left to the deci&s;ion of future navi|gators. We ob&s;erved five of them, who&s;e names are Woahoo, Atooi, Oneeheow, Oreehoua, and Tahoora. The la&s;t of the&s;e is a &s;mall elevated i&s;land, at the di&s;tance of four or five leages from the &s;outh-ea&s;t point of Oneeheow. We were in|formed, that it abounds with birds, which are its &s;ole inhabitants. We al&s;o gained &s;ome intelli|gence with regard to the exi&s;tence of a low unin|habited i&s;land in the neighbourhood, named Tam|mata-pappa. Be&s;ides the&s;e &s;ix, we were told that there were &s;ome other i&s;lands both to the ea&s;tward and we&s;tward. Captain Cook di&s;tin|gui&s;hed the whole group by the name of the Sand|wich I&s;lands, in honour of the Earl of Sandwich. Tho&s;e which we &s;aw are &s;ituated between the la|titude of 21&deg; 30&prime;, and 22&deg; 15&prime; north, and between the longitude of 199&deg; 20&prime;, and 201&deg; 30&prime;, ea&s;t.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to Woahoo, the mo&s;t ea&s;terly of the&s;e i&s;lands &s;een by us, we could get no other information, but that it is high land, and is in|habited.</P>
<P>Oneeheow, concerning which &s;ome particulars have been already mentioned, lies, &s;even leagues to the we&s;tward of our anchoring-place at Atooi,
<PB N="162" REF="030274_0607_0FE570D094620480">
and does not exceed fifteen leagues in circum|ference. Yams are its principal vegetable pro|duction. We procured &s;ome &s;alt here, called by the natives <HI>patai,</HI> which is produced in &s;alt ponds. With it they cure both fi&s;h and pork; and &s;ome &s;alt fi&s;h, which we purcha&s;ed from them, were extremely good, and kept very well. This i&s;land is chiefly low land, except the part oppo&s;ite Atooi, which ri&s;es immediately from the &s;ea to a con|&s;iderable height; as does al&s;o its &s;outh-ea&s;t point, which terminates in a round hill.</P>
<P>Of Oreehoua we know no other particulars than that it is an elevated i&s;land, of &s;mall extent, lying clo&s;e to the north &s;ide of Oneeheow.</P>
<P>Atooi, which is the large&s;t of tho&s;e we &s;aw, being the principal &s;cene of our operations, we &s;hall now proceed to lay before our readers &s;uch information as we were able to collect concerning it. From what we ob&s;erved of it, it is, at lea&s;t, ten leagues in length from ea&s;t to we&s;t; from whence its circumference may nearly be gue&s;&s;ed, though it appears to be much broader at the ea&s;t than at the we&s;t point. The road, or anchoring-place, which our ve&s;&s;els occupied, is on the &s;outh-we&s;t &s;ide of the i&s;land, about two leagues from the we&s;t end, before a village named Wymoa. As far as we &s;ounded, we found the bank free from rocks; except to the ea&s;tward of the village, where there projects a &s;hoal, on which are &s;ome rocks and breakers. This road is &s;omewhat ex|po&s;ed
<PB N="163" REF="030274_0608_0FE57002885F6308">
to the trade wind; notwith&s;tanding which defect, it is far from being a bad &s;tation, and greatly &s;uperior to tho&s;e which nece&s;&s;ity conti|nually obliges &s;hips to u&s;e, in countries where the winds are not only more variable, but more boi&s;terous; as at Madeira, Teneriffe, the Azores, &amp;c. The landing too is not &s;o difficult as at mo&s;t of tho&s;e places; and, unle&s;s in very bad weather is always practicable. The water in the neigh|bourhood is excellent, and may be conveyed with ea&s;e to the boats. But no wood can be cut at any convenient di&s;tance, unle&s;s the i&s;landers could be prevailed upon to part with the few <HI>etooa</HI> trees (for that is the name they give to the <HI>cordia &s;eba&s;tina</HI>) that grow about their villages, or a &s;pe|cies called <HI>dooe dooe,</HI> which grows farther up the country.</P>
<P>The land does not in the lea&s;t re&s;emble, in its general appearance, any of the i&s;lands we have vi&s;ited within the tropic of Capricorn; if we ex|cept its hills near the centre, which are high, but &s;lope gradually towards the &s;ea, or lower lands. Though it pre&s;ents not to the view, the delightful borders of Otaheite, or the luxuriant plains of Tongataboo, covered with trees, which at once afford a &s;helter from the &s;corchin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> rays of the &s;un, a beautiful pro&s;pect of the eye, and food for the natives; yet its po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing a greater portion of gently ri&s;ing land, renders it, in &s;ome degree, &s;uperior to the above-mentioned favourite i&s;lands,
<PB N="164" REF="030274_0609_0FE56FFD1601D1D0">
as being more capable of improvement. The height of the land within, and the number of clouds which we &s;aw, during the whole time of our continuance, hanging over it, and not unfre|quently on the other parts, &s;eem to indicate that there is a &s;ufficient &s;upply of water, and that there are &s;ome running &s;treams which we had not an opportuniry of &s;eeing, particularly in the deep valles, at the entrance of which the villages are, in general, &s;ituated. The ground, from the wooded part to the &s;ea, is covered with an excellent kind of gra&s;s, about two, feet in height, which &s;ome|times grows in tufts, and appeared capable of being converted into abundant crops of fine hay. But on this exten&s;ive &s;pace not even a &s;hrub grows naturally.</P>
<P>In the narrow valley leading to the <HI>morai,</HI> the &s;oil is of a dark-brown colour, rather loo&s;e; but, on the high ground, it is of a reddi&s;h brown more &s;tiff and clayey. It is probably the &s;ame all over the cultivated parts; for what adhered to mo&s;t of the potatoes that we purcha&s;ed, which, doubtle&s;s, came from very different &s;pots, was of this &s;ort. Its quality, however, may be better e&s;timated from its productions, than from its ap|pearance.

<P>Were we to judge of the climate from our ex|perience, it might be &s;aid to be very variable; for, according to the general opinion; it was, at this time, the &s;ea&s;on of the year when the weather is &s;uppo&s;ed to be mo&s;t &s;ettled, the &s;un being at his greate&s;t annual di&s;tance. The heat was now very moderate; and few of tho&s;e inconveniences to which many countries lying within the tropics are &s;ubject, either from heat, moi&s;ture, &s;eem to be experienced here. Nor did we find any dews of con&s;equence; a circum&s;tance which may partly be accounted for, by the lower part of the coun|try being de&s;titute of trees.</P>
<P>The rock that con&s;titutes the &s;ides of the valley, is a dark-grey ponderous &s;tone; but honey-combed, with &s;ome &s;pots of a ru&s;ty colour, and &s;ome very minute &s;hining particles inter&s;per&s;ed. It is of an immen&s;e depth, and &s;eems to be di|vided into <HI>&s;trata</HI>; though nothing is interpo&s;ed; for the large pieces always broke off to a deter|minate thickne&s;s, and did not appear to have ad|hered to tho&s;e that were below them. Other &s;tones are, in all probability, much more various than in the &s;outhern i&s;lands. For, during the &s;hort time we remained here, be&s;ides the <HI>lapis lydius,</HI> we found a &s;pecies of cream-coloured whet&s;tone, &s;ometimes variegated with whiter or blacker veins, like marble; and common writing &s;late, as well

as &s;ome of a coar&s;er &s;ort; and the natives brought us &s;ome pieces of a coar&s;er whiti&s;h pumice &s;tone. We all procured a brown &s;ort of <HI>haematites,</HI> which, from its being &s;trongly attracted by the magnet, di&s;covered the quantity of metal it contained. What we &s;aw of this was cut artificially, as were al&s;o the &s;lates and whet&s;tones.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the vegetables purcha&s;ed by us as re|fre&s;hments, among which were, at lea&s;t, five or &s;ix varieties of plantains, the i&s;land produces bread fruit: this, however, &s;eems to be &s;carce, as we only &s;aw one tree of that &s;pecies. There are al&s;o a few cocoa-palms; &s;ome yams; the <HI>kappe</HI> of the Friendly I&s;lands, or Virginian <HI>arum;</HI> the <HI>atooa</HI> tree, and odoriferous <HI>gardenia,</HI> or <HI>cape ja&s;|mine.</HI> We met with &s;everal trees of the <HI>dooe dooe,</HI> that bear the oily nuts, which are &s;tuck upon a kind of &s;kewer, and made u&s;e of as candles. Our people &s;aw them u&s;ed in the &s;ame manner at Oneeheow. We were not on &s;hore at Atooi ex|cept in the day time, and then we ob&s;erved the i&s;landers wearing the&s;e nuts, hung on &s;trings, round their necks. There is a &s;pecies of <HI>&s;ida,</HI> or Indian mallow; al&s;o the <HI>morinda citrifolia,</HI> which is here called <HI>none;</HI> a &s;pecies of <HI>convolvulus;</HI> the <HI>ava,</HI> or intoxicating pepper, be&s;ides great quan|tities of gourds. The&s;e la&s;t grow to a very large &s;ize, and are of a remarkable variety of &s;hapes, which are, perhaps, the effect of art. Upon the dry &s;and, about the village, grew a plant, that had

never been &s;een by us in this ocean, of the &s;ize of a common thi&s;tle, and prickly; but bearing a fine flower, greatly re&s;embling a white poppy.</P>
<P>The &s;carlet birds, which were brought for &s;ale, were never met with alive; but we &s;aw one &s;mall one, about the &s;ize of a canary bird, of a deep crim&s;on colour. We al&s;o &s;aw a large owl, two brown hawks, or kites, and a wild duck. We heard from the natives the names of &s;ome other birds; among which were the <HI>otoo,</HI> or bluei&s;h heron, and the <HI>torata,</HI> a &s;ort of whimbrel. It is probable that the &s;pecies of birds are numerous, if we may judge by the quantity of fine yellow, green, and &s;mall, velvet-like, blacki&s;h feathers u&s;ed upon the cloaks, and other ornaments, worn by the&s;e people.</P>
<P>Fi&s;h, and other productions of the &s;ea, were, to appearance, not various; as be&s;ides the &s;mall mackarel, we only &s;aw common mullets; a &s;pe|cies of a chalky colour; a &s;mall browni&s;h rock-fi&s;h, adorned with blue &s;pots; a turtle, which was penned up in a pond; and three or four &s;orts of fi&s;h &s;alted. The few &s;hell-fi&s;h &s;een by us were chiefly converted into ornaments, though they were de&s;titute of the recommendation either of beauty or novelty.</P>
<P>The only tame or dome&s;tic animals that we found here were hogs, dogs, and fowls, which were all of the &s;ame kind that we met with at the i&s;lands of the South Pacific. There were al&s;o
<PB N="168" REF="030274_0614_0FE570DD4E2A1D28">
&s;mall lizards; and &s;ome rats, re&s;embling tho&s;e of every i&s;land which we had hitherto vi&s;ited.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of Atooi are of the middle &s;ize, and in general, &s;toutly made. They are neither remarkable for a beautiful &s;hape, nor for &s;triking features. Their vi&s;age, particularly that of the women, is &s;ometimes round, but others have it long; nor can it ju&s;tly be &s;aid, that they are di&s;tingui&s;hed, as a nation, by any general ca&s;t of countenance. Their complexion is nearly of a nut brown; but &s;ome individuals are of a darker hue. We have already mentioned the women as being little more delicate than the men in their formation; and we may add, that, with few ex|ceptions they have little claim to tho&s;e peculiari|ties that di&s;tingui&s;h the &s;ex in mo&s;t other parts of the world. There is, indeed, a very remarkable equality in the &s;ize, colour and figure, of the na|tives of both &s;exes; upon the whole, however, they are far from being ugly, and have to all ap|pearance, few natural deformities of any kind. Their &s;kins is not very &s;oft, nor &s;hining; but their eyes and teeth are, for the mo&s;t part, pretty good. Their hair, in general, is &s;traight; and though its natural colour is u&s;ually black; they &s;tain it, as at the Friendly and other i&s;lands. We perceived but few in&s;tances of corpulence, and the&s;e more frequently among the women than the men; but it was principally among the latter, that per&s;onal defects were ob&s;erved; though, if any of them can
<PB N="169" REF="030274_0615_0FE56FFF7442FB88">
lay claim to a &s;hare of beauty, it appeared to be mo&s;t con&s;picuous among&s;t the young men.</P>
<P>They are active, vigorous, and mo&s;t expert &s;wimmers; leaving their canoes upon the mo&s;t frivolous occa&s;ion, diving under them, and &s;mim|ming to others, though at a con&s;iderable di&s;|tance. We have frequently &s;een women, with infants at the brea&s;t, when the &s;urf was &s;o high as to prevent their landing in the canoes, leap overboard, and &s;wim to the &s;hore, without en|dangering their little ones.</P>
<P>They appear to be of a frank, chearful di&s;po|&s;ition; and are equally free from the fickle levity which characterizes the inhabitants of Otaheite, and the &s;edate ca&s;t which is ob&s;ervable among many of tho&s;e of Tongataboo. They &s;eem to cultivate a &s;ociable intercour&s;e with each other; and except the propen&s;ity to thieving, which is, as it were, innate in mo&s;t of the people we have vi&s;ited in the&s;e &s;eas, they were extremely friendly to us. And it does no &s;mall credit to their &s;en|&s;ibility, without flattering our&s;elves, that when they &s;aw the different articles of our European ma|nufacture, they could not refrain from expre&s;&s;ing their a&s;toni&s;hment, by a mixture of joy and con|cern, that &s;eemed to apply the ca&s;e as a le&s;&s;on of humility to them&s;elves; and, on every occa&s;ion, they appeared to have a proper con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of their own inferiority; a behaviour that equally exempts their national character from the ridicu|lous
<PB N="170" REF="030274_0616_0FE570DF0275CA90">
pride of the more poli&s;hed Japane&s;e, and of the ruder native of Greenland. It was plea&s;ing to ob&s;erve with what affection the women managed their infants, and with what alacrity the men con|tributed their a&s;&s;i&s;tance in &s;uch a tender office; thus di&s;tingui&s;hing them&s;elves from tho&s;e &s;avages, who con&s;ider a wife and child as things rather ne|ce&s;&s;ary, than de&s;irable, or worthy of their re|gard and e&s;teem.</P>
<P>From the numbers that we &s;aw a&s;&s;embled at every village, as we coa&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> along, it may be con|jectured, that the inhabitants of this i&s;land are pretty numerous. Including the &s;traggling hou&s;es, there might perhaps be, in the whole i&s;land &s;ixty &s;uch villages as that near which our &s;hips an|chored; and if we allow five per&s;ons to each hou&s;e, there would be, in every village, five hun|dred; or thirty thou&s;and upon the i&s;land. This number is by no means exaggerated, for there were &s;ometimes three thou&s;and people, at lea&s;t, collected upon the beach; when it could not be &s;uppo&s;ed, that above a tenth part of the natives were pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>The ordinary dre&s;s of both &s;exes has been al|ready de&s;cribed. The women have often much larger pieces of cloth wrapped about them, ex|tending from ju&s;t below the brea&s;ts to the hams, and &s;ometimes lower; and &s;everal were ob&s;erved with pieces thrown loo&s;ely over their &s;houlders, which covered the greate&s;t part of the body; but
<PB N="171" REF="030274_0617_0FE570E0DDE1B050">
the children, when very young, are entirely naked. They wear nothing upon the head; but the hair both of men and women, is cut in various forms; and the general fa&s;hion, particularly among the latter, is to have it &s;hort behind, and long before. The men frequently had it cut on each &s;ide in &s;uch a manner, that the remaining part &s;omewhat re&s;embled the cre&s;t of their caps or helmets, before mentioned. Both &s;exes, however, &s;eemed to be very carele&s;s about the hair, and had no combs, nor any thing of the kind to dre&s;s it with. The men &s;ometimes twi&s;t it into a number of &s;eparate parcels, like the tails of a wig, each about as thick as a finger; though mo&s;t of the&s;e which are &s;o long as to reach far down the back, are artifici|ally fixed upon the head, over their own hair.</P>
<P>Contrary to the general practi&s;e of mo&s;t of the i&s;lands of the Pacific Ocean, the people of the Sandwich I&s;les have not their ears perforated, nor do they were any ornaments in them. Both men and women however, adorn them&s;elves with necklaces compo&s;ed of bunches of &s;mall black cord, like our hat-&s;tring, often above a hundred|fold; entirely re&s;embling tho&s;e we &s;aw worn at Woteeoo, except that, in&s;tead of the two little balls on the middle before, they fix a &s;mall piece of wood, &s;tone, or &s;hell, about two inches in length, with a broad hook, well poli&s;hed. They have al&s;o necklaces of many &s;trings of very &s;mall &s;hells, or of the dried flowers of the Indian mallow; and
<PB N="172" REF="030274_0618_0FE570E64F5BA400">
they &s;ometimes hang round their necks a &s;mall human figure of bone, about the length of three inches. The women likewi&s;e wear bracelets of a &s;ingle &s;hell, pieces of black wood, with bits of ivory inter&s;per&s;ed, and neatly poli&s;hed, fa&s;tened together by the &s;tring drawn clo&s;ely through them; or others of hogs-teeth, placed parallel to each other, with the concave part outward, and the points cut off; &s;ome of which, formed only of large boar's tu&s;ks, are very elegant. The men &s;ometimes fix on their heads plumes of feathers of the tropic bird; or tho&s;e of cocks, fa&s;tened round neat poli&s;hed &s;ticks, two feet in length; and, for the &s;ame purpo&s;e, they &s;ew the &s;kin of a white dog's tail over a &s;tick, with its tuft <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the end. They al&s;o, not unfrequently, wear on the head a kind of ornament, of the thickne&s;s of a finger, or more, covered with yellow and red feathers, curiou&s;ly varied, and tied behind; and, on that part of the arm which is above elbow, a &s;ort of broad &s;hell-work, grounded upon net-work.</P>
<P>The men &s;ometimes puncture them&s;elves upon their hands or arms, and near the groin; but fre|quently we &s;aw no marks at all; though a few individuals had more of this &s;pecies of ornament than we had u&s;ually &s;een at other places, and cu|riou&s;ly executed in a great variety of lines and figures, on the arms and fore-part of the body. Contrary to the cu&s;tom of the Friendly and Society I&s;lands, they do not &s;lit, or cut off, any part of the

<P>There is no appearance of defence, or fortifica|tion, near any of their villages, and the hou&s;es, are &s;cattered about, without the lea&s;t order. Some of the&s;e habitations are large and commodious, from forty to fifty feet in length, and twenty or thirty in breadth; while others of them are con|temptible hovels. Their figure re&s;embles that of hay-&s;tacks; or, perhaps, a better idea may be con|ceived of them, by &s;uppo&s;ing the roof of a barn placed on the ground, in &s;uch a manner, as to form a high, acute ridge, with two low &s;ides. The gable at each end corre&s;ponding to the &s;ides, makes the&s;e dwelling-places clo&s;e all round; and they are well thatched with long gra&s;s, which is laid on &s;lender poles. The entrance is made either in the end or &s;ide, and is an oblong hole, extremely low; it is often &s;hut up by a board or planks, fa&s;tened together, which &s;erves as a door; but, as it has no hinges, mu&s;t be removed occa|&s;ionally. No light enters the hou&s;e except by this opening; and though &s;uch clo&s;e habitations may be comfortable places of retreat in bad weather, they &s;eem but ill-adapted to the warm climate of this country. They are kept remarkably clean, and the floors are &s;trewed with dried gra&s;s, over which mats are &s;pread to &s;it and &s;leep on. At one end &s;tands a bench, about three feet high, on which the dome&s;tic uten&s;ils are placed. The&s;e

con&s;i&s;t of gourd-&s;hells, which the natives convert into ve&s;&s;els that &s;erve a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> bottles to hold water, and as ba&s;kets to contain their food, and other things; and al&s;o of a few wooden bowls and trenchers of various &s;izes.</P>
<P>From what we &s;aw growing, and from what was brought to market, we have no doubt, that &s;weet potatoes, <HI>taro,</HI> and plantains, con&s;titute the principal part of their vegetable diet; and that yams and bread-fruit are rather to be con&s;ider|ed as rarities. Of animal food, they appear to be in no want; as they have great numbers of hogs, which run without re&s;traint, about the hou&s;es; and, if they eat dogs, which is not altogether improbable, their &s;tock of the&s;e &s;eemed very con&s;iderable. The quantities of fi&s;hing-hooks found among them, indicated that they procure a tolerable &s;upply of animal food from the &s;ea. They have a cu&s;tom of &s;alting-fi&s;h, and likewi&s;e pork, which they pre&s;erve in gourd-&s;hells. The &s;alt, which they u&s;e for this purpo&s;e, is of a red|di&s;h colour, but not very coar&s;e, and &s;eems to be nearly the &s;ame with what our &s;tragglers found at Chri&s;tmas I&s;land. Its colour, is doubtle&s;s, de|rived from a mixture of mud, at the bottom of the part where it is formed; for &s;ome of it, which had adhered in lumps, was of a tolerable whitene&s;s.</P>
<P>They bake their vegetable articles of food with heated &s;tones; and, from the great quantity which we &s;aw dre&s;&s;ed at one time, we imagined, that
<PB N="175" REF="030274_0623_0FE570EBA4716820">
all the inhabitants of a village, or at lea&s;t, a con|&s;iderable number of people, joined in the u&s;e of a common oven. We did not perceive them dre&s;s any animal food at this i&s;land; but Mr. Gore's party, as has been already mentioned, ob&s;erved that it was dre&s;&s;ed at Oneeheow in the &s;ame kind of ovens, which makes it highly probable that this is al&s;o the practice in Atooi; particularly as we met with no uten&s;il there, that could &s;erve the purpo&s;e of boiling or &s;tewing. The only artificial di&s;h we &s;aw was a <HI>taro</HI> pudding; which, though very &s;our, was devoured with avidity by the natives. They eat off a &s;ort of wooden trenchers; and as far as we were enabled to judge from one in&s;tance, the women, if re&s;trained from feeding at the &s;ame di&s;h with the men, as is the cu&s;tom at Otaheite, are, at lea&s;t, allowed to eat in the &s;ame place near them.</P>
<P>The amu&s;ements of the&s;e people are various. We did not &s;ee the dances at which they u&s;e the feathered cloaks and caps; but, from the mo|tions which they made with their hands, on other occa&s;ions, when they &s;ung, we judged that they were &s;omewhat &s;imilar to tho&s;e we had met with at the &s;outhern i&s;lands, though not &s;o &s;kilfully performed. They had not among them, either flutes or reeds; and the only two mu&s;ical in&s;tru|ments, &s;een by us, were of an extremely rude kind. One of them does not produce a melody &s;uperior to that of a child's rattle. It con&s;i&s;ts of what may be denominated a conic cap invert|ed,
<PB N="176" REF="030274_0624_0FE570EECF4A1BB8">
but very little hollowed at the ba&s;e, made of a &s;edge-like plant; the upper part of which, and likewi&s;e the edges, are embelli&s;hed with beau|tiful red feathers; and to the point, or lower part, is a fixed gourd-&s;hell. Into this they put &s;ome|thing to rattle, which is done by holding the in&s;trument by the &s;mall part, and &s;haking it bri&s;kly before the face, at the &s;ame time &s;triking the brea&s;t with the other hand. The other in|&s;trument was a hollow ve&s;&s;el of wood, not unlike a platter, combined with the u&s;e of two &s;ticks, on which one of our gentlemen ob&s;erved a man performing. He held one of the &s;ticks, about two feet in length, with one hand, in the &s;ame manner as we hold a violin, and &s;truck it with the other, which was &s;maller, and re&s;embled a drum-&s;tick, in a quicker or flower mea&s;ure; beating with his foot at the &s;ame time upon the hollow ve&s;&s;el, that lay upon the ground invert|ed, and thus producing a tune, that was not di&s;agreeable. This mu&s;ic was accompanied by the vocal performance of &s;ome women, who&s;e &s;ong had a plea&s;ing effect.</P>
<P>They have great numbers of &s;mall poli&s;hed rods, of the length of between four and five feet, rather thicker than the rammer of a mu&s;|quet, with a tuft of long white dog's hair fixed on the &s;mall end. The&s;e they probably make u&s;e of their diver&s;ions. We &s;aw a native take one of them in his hand, and, holding it up, give

a &s;mart &s;troke, till it was brought into an ho|rizontal po&s;ition, &s;triking the ground with his foot, on the &s;ame &s;ide, and beating his brea&s;t with his other hand. They play it bowls with pieces of the whet-&s;tone above-mentioned, &s;haped &s;ome|what like a &s;mall chee&s;e, but rounded at the edges and &s;ides, which are very neatly poli&s;hed.

<P>In the different manufactures of the&s;e people, there appears to be an extraordinary degree of ingenuity and neatne&s;s. Their cloth is made from the <HI>morus papyrifera,</HI> and, doubtle&s;s, in the &s;ame manner, as at Tongataboo and Otaheite; for we bought &s;ome of the grooved &s;ticks with which, they beat it. Its texture, however, though thicker, is inferior to that of the cloth of either of the places ju&s;t mentioned; but in colouring or &s;taining it, the inhabitants of Atooi di&s;play a &s;uperiority of ta&s;te, by the infinite variety of fi|gures which they execute. Their colours, in|deed, are not very bright, except the red; but the regularity of the figures and &s;tripes is amazing; for, as far as we know, they have nothing like &s;tamps or prints, to make the impre&s;&s;ions. We had no opportunity of learning in what manner they produce their colours; but, be&s;ides the
<PB N="178" REF="030274_0627_0FE5710A61D6A8A0">
variegated &s;orts, they have &s;ome pieces of plain white cloth, and others of a &s;ingle colour, par|ticularly light blue, and dark-brown. In gene|ral, the pieces brought to us were about the breadth of two feet, and four or five yards in length, being the form and quantity made u&s;e of by them for their common dre&s;s, or <HI>maro</HI>; and even &s;ome of the&s;e were compo&s;ed of pieces &s;ew|ed together. They have al&s;o a particular &s;ort that is thin and greatly re&s;embles oil-cloth; and which is either oiled or &s;oaked in &s;ome kind of varni&s;h. They fabricate numbers of white mats, which were &s;trong, with many red &s;tripes, rhom|bu&s;es, and other figures interwoven on one &s;ide. The&s;e in all probability, occa&s;ionally make a part of their dre&s;s; for, when they offered them to &s;ale, they put them on their backs. They ma|nufacture others of a coar&s;er &s;ort, plain and &s;trong, which they &s;pread over their floors, to &s;leep upon.</P>
<P>They &s;tain their gourd-&s;hells neatly with undu|lated lines, triangles, and other figures of a black colour. They al&s;o &s;eem to be acquainted with the art of varni&s;hing; for &s;ome of the&s;e &s;tained gourd-&s;hells are covered with a &s;ort of lacker; and, on other occa&s;ions, they make u&s;e of a &s;trong &s;ize, or glutinous &s;ub&s;tance, to fa&s;ten things to|gether. Their wooden di&s;hes and bowls, out of which they drink their <HI>ava,</HI> are of the <HI>etooa</HI> tree, or <HI>cordia,</HI> extremely neat and well poli&s;hed.
<PB N="179" REF="030274_0628_0FE57111D486DE18">
They likewi&s;e make &s;mall &s;quare fans of mat or wicker-work, with handles of the &s;ame, or of wood tapering from them, which are curiou&s;ly wrought with &s;mall cords of hair, and cocoa-nut fibres, intermixed. Their fi&s;hing-hooks are in|geniou&s;ly made; &s;ome of bone, many of pearl|&s;hell, and others of wood, pointed with bone. The bones are for the mo&s;t part &s;mall, and con|&s;i&s;t of two pieces; and the various &s;orts have a barb, either on the in&s;ide, like ours, or on the out&s;ide; but others have both, the exterior one being farthe&s;t from the point. Of the latter &s;ort one was procured, nine inches in length, made of a &s;ingle piece of bone; the elegant form and poli&s;h of which, could not be exceeded by any European arti&s;t. They poli&s;h their &s;tones, by con&s;tant friction, with pumice-&s;tone in water; and &s;uch of their tools as we &s;aw, re&s;embled tho&s;e of the &s;outhern i&s;landers. Their hatchets. or rather adzes, were exactly of the &s;ame pattern, and were either formed of a blacki&s;h &s;tone, or of a clay-coloured one. They have al&s;o &s;mall in&s;truments compo&s;ed of a &s;ingle &s;hark's tooth, &s;ome of which are fixed to the fore-part of the jaw-bone of a dog, and others to a thin wooden handle of a &s;imilar &s;hape; and at the other end there is a bit of &s;tring fa&s;tened through a little hole. They &s;erve occa&s;ionally as knives, and are, probably, u&s;ed in carving.</P>
<P><PB N="180" REF="030274_0629_0FE57113797B7FF8">The only iron-tools &s;een among them, and which they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed before our arrival, were a piece of iron-hoop, about the length of two inches, fitted into a wooden handle; and another edge|tool, which we &s;uppo&s;ed to have been made of the point of a broad &s;word. Their having the actual po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the&s;e, and their being well acquainted with the u&s;e of this metal, inclined &s;ome of our people to imagine that we were not the fir&s;t European vi&s;itors of the&s;e i&s;lands. But the very great &s;urprize which they te&s;tified on &s;eeing our &s;hips, and their perfect ignorance of the u&s;e of fire-arms, cannot be reconciled with &s;uch an opinion. There are &s;everal means by which &s;uch people may obtain pieces of iron, or acquire the knowledge of the exi&s;tence of that metal, without having had an immediate con|nection with tho&s;e nations that u&s;e it. It can &s;carcely be doubted, that it was unknown to all the inhabitants of the Pacific Ocean, till Magel|lan led the way into it; for no navigator, immedi|ately after his voyage, found any of this metal in their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; though, in the cour&s;e of our late voyages, it has been remarked, that the u&s;e of it was known at &s;everal i&s;lands, which no for|mer European ve&s;&s;el had ever, to our knowledge, vi&s;ited. At all the places where Mendana touch|ed, during his two voyages, &s;ome of it mu&s;t have been left; and this would, doubtle&s;s, extend the knowledge of it to all the various i&s;lands with
<PB N="181" REF="030274_0630_0FE57115049942E8">
which the people, whom he vi&s;ited, had any im|mediate intercour&s;e. It might even have been carried farther; and where &s;pecimens of this va|luable article could not be met with, de&s;crip|tions might, in &s;ome degree, &s;erve to make it known, when afterwards &s;een. The next voyage to the &s;outhward of the equator, in which any intercour&s;e was had with the people who inhabit the i&s;lands of this ocean, was that of Quiros, who landed at Sagittaria, the i&s;land of Hand&s;ome Peo|ple, and at Tierra del E&s;piritu Santo; at all which places, as well as at tho&s;e with which they had any communication, it mu&s;t undoubtedly have been made known. To him &s;ucceeded, in this navigation, Le Maire, and Schouten, who&s;e con|nections with the natives began much farther to the ea&s;tward, and terminated at Cocos and Horn i&s;lands. It is certain, that the inhabitants of Ota|heite, and the Society I&s;les, had a knowledge of iron, and purcha&s;ed it with the greate&s;t avidity, when Captain Wallis di&s;covered Otaheite; and they could only have acquired this knowledge through the mediation of tho&s;e neighbouring i&s;lands at which it had been originally left. They acknowledge, indeed, that this was really the ca&s;e; and they have &s;ince informed us, that they held it in &s;uch e&s;timation, before the arrival of Captain Wallis, that an Otaheitean chief, who had gained po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of two nails, received no &s;mall emo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ment, by letting out the u&s;e of them
<PB N="182" REF="030274_0631_0FE57116EDF00A50">
to his neighbours, for the purpo&s;e of boring holes. The natives of the Society I&s;lands, whom we found at Wateeoo, had been driven to that place long after the knowledge and u&s;e of iron had been thus introduced among their country|men; and though, perhaps, they had no &s;peci|men of it with them, they would naturally com|municate at that i&s;land, by di&s;cription, their knowledge of this u&s;eful metal. From the people of Wateeoo, again, tho&s;e of Hervey's I&s;land might derive that inclination for it, of which we had &s;ufficient proofs during our &s;hort intercour&s;e with them.</P>
<P>The con&s;ideration of the facts will &s;hew, how the knowledge of iron has been conveyed throughout the Pacific Ocean, to i&s;lands which have never had an immediate connection with Europeans; and it may ea&s;ily be imagined, that, wherever the hi&s;tory of it only has been report|ed, or a very incon&s;iderable quantity of it has been left, the greater eagerne&s;s will be &s;hewn by the inhabitants to procure plentiful &s;upplies of it. The application of the&s;e particulars, to the object of our pre&s;ent con&s;ideration, is manife&s;t. The natives of Atooi and Oneeheow, without having ever been vi&s;ited by Europeans before us, might have received this metal from interme|diate i&s;lands, &s;ituated between them and the La|drones which the Spaniards have frequented al|mo&s;t ever &s;ince the period of Magellan's voyage.
<PB N="183" REF="030274_0632_0FE5711C23D64D18">
Or, if the di&s;tant we&s;tern po&s;ition of the La|drones, &s;hould detract from the probability of this &s;olution, is there not the American continent to windward, where the Spaniards have been &s;et|tled for upwards of two centuries and a half: dur|ing which long &s;pace of time, &s;hipwrecks mu&s;t fre|quently have happened on its coa&s;ts? It cannot be deemed &s;urprizing that part of &s;uch wrecks, con|taining iron, &s;hould, by the ea&s;terly trade-winds, be occa&s;ionally ca&s;t upon &s;ome of tho&s;e i&s;lands which are di&s;per&s;ed about this immen&s;e ocean.&mdash; The di&s;tance of Atooi from America, is no argu|ment again&s;t this &s;uppo&s;ition; and even if it were, it would not de&s;troy it. This ocean is annually traver&s;ed by Spani&s;h ve&s;&s;els; and it is highly proba|ble, that, be&s;ides the accident of lo&s;ing a ma&s;t and its appendages, ca&s;ks with iron-hoops, and many other things that contain iron, may fall, or be thrown overboard during &s;o long a pa&s;&s;age, and thus find their way to land. The&s;e are not mere conjectures; for one of Captain Cook's peo|ple actually &s;aw &s;ome wood in a hou&s;e at Wymoa, which he &s;uppo&s;ed to be fir: it was worm-eaten, and the natives informed him, that it had been driven a&s;hore by the waves; and we had their own expre&s;s te&s;timony, that they had obtained, from &s;ome place to the ea&s;tward, the &s;pecimens of iron found among them.</P>
<P><PB N="184" REF="030274_0633_0FE5711E12505EA8">From this digre&s;&s;ion (if it can ju&s;tly be called &s;o) let us return to the ob&s;ervations made during our continuance at Atooi. The canoes of the&s;e people are commonly about four and twenty feet in length, and have the bottom, in general, form|ed of a &s;ingle picee of wood, hollwed out to the thickne&s;s of an inch, or more, and brought to a point at each end. The &s;ides are compo&s;ed of three boards, each about an inch thick; neatly fitted and la&s;hed to the bottom. The extremi|ties, both at head and &s;tern, are a little elevat|ed, and both are made &s;harp, &s;omewhat re&s;em|bling a wedge, but they flatter more abruptly, &s;o that the two &s;ide-boards join each other, &s;ide by &s;ide, for upwards of a foot. As they &s;eldom exceed a foot and a half in breadth, tho&s;e that go &s;ingle (for they &s;ometimes join them) have out|riggers, which are &s;haped and fitted with more judgment than any we had before &s;een. They are rowed by paddles, &s;uch as we had generally ob&s;erved at other i&s;lands; and &s;ome of them have a light triangular &s;ail, extended to a ma&s;t and boom. The ropes which they u&s;e for their boats, and the &s;maller cords for their fi&s;hing-tackles, are &s;trong, and neatly made.</P>
<P>They are by no means novices in the art of agriculture. The vale-ground is one continu|ed plantation of <HI>taro,</HI> and &s;ome other articles, which have all the appearance of being carefully attended to. The potatoe-fields, and &s;pots of

&s;ugar-cane, or plantains, on the higher grounds, are planted with great regularity; but neither the&s;e, nor the others, are enclo&s;ed with any fence, unle&s;s we con&s;ider the ditches in the low grounds as &s;uch; which, it is more probable, are de&s;ign|ed to convey water to the <HI>taro.</HI> The great quan|tity and excellence of the&s;e articles, may perhaps be as much owing to &s;kilful culture, as natural fertility of &s;oil, which &s;eems better adapted to them than to bread-fruit and cocoa-nut trees; the few we &s;aw of the&s;e latter not being in a thriv|ing &s;tate. Notwith&s;tanding this &s;kill in agricul|ture, the i&s;land, from its general appearance, &s;eem|ed to be capable of more exten&s;ive improvement, and of mantaining thrice as many inhabitants as are now upon it; for the greater part of it, that now lies wa&s;te, was apparently as good a &s;oil as tho&s;e parts that are cultivated. It mu&s;t there|fore be inferred, that the&s;e people do not increa&s;e in that proportion, which, would render it ne|ce&s;&s;ary for them to take advantage of the extent of their i&s;lands, towards rai&s;ing a greater quantity of its vegetable productions for their maintenance.</P>
<P>Though Captain Cook did not &s;ee a chief of any note, there were, however, &s;everal, as the i&s;landers informed us, who re&s;ide at Atooi, and to whom they pro&s;trate them&s;elves as a mark of homage and re&s;pect. This pro&s;tration &s;eems equivalent to the <HI>moe moea,</HI> paid to the chiefs of the Friendly I&s;lands, and is here denominated
<PB N="186" REF="030274_0636_0FE571214A2F73D0">
<HI>hamoea,</HI> or <HI>moe.</HI> Whether they were, at fir&s;t, afraid to &s;hew them&s;elves, or happened to be ab|&s;ent, we cannot determine; but after the Re&s;o|lution had left the i&s;land, one of the&s;e great men made his appearance, and vi&s;ited Captain Clerke on board the di&s;covery; he came off in a double canoe; and, like the &s;overeign of the Friendly I&s;les, paid no regard to the &s;mall canoes that chanced to be in his way, but ran again&s;t, or over them, without making the lea&s;t attempt to avoid them. And it was impo&s;&s;ible for the&s;e poor people to avoid him, for they could not then manage their canoes; it being a nece&s;&s;ary mark of their &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, that they &s;hould lie down till he had pa&s;&s;ed. His attendants a&s;&s;i&s;ted him in getting on board the &s;hip, and placed him in the gang-way&punc; where they &s;tood round him, holding each other by the hands; nor would they &s;uffer any one to approach him but Captain Clerke him&s;elf. He was a young man, apparelled from head to foot, and was accompanied by a young woman, who was perhaps his wife. His name was &s;aid to be Tamahano. Captain Clerke hav|ing made him &s;ome pre&s;ents, received from him, in return, a large bowl, &s;upported by two figures of men, the carving of which di&s;played &s;ome de|gree of &s;kill, both with re&s;pect to the de&s;ign and the execution. This bowl u&s;ed to be filled with the <HI>kava,</HI> or <HI>ava,</HI> (as it is termed at Otaheite), which liquor is prepared and drank here as at
<PB N="187" REF="030274_0637_0FE57125DFB40EF0">
the other i&s;lands of the Pacific Ocean. Captain Clerke could not prevail upon this chief to go below, nor to move from the &s;pot where his at|tendants had fir&s;t placed him. After remaining &s;ome time in the &s;hip, he was carried back into his canoe, and returned to the i&s;land. The fol|lowing day, &s;everal me&s;&s;ages were &s;ent to Cap|tain Clerke, inviting him to return the vi&s;it on &s;hore, and giving him to under&s;tand, that the chief had prepared a con&s;iderable pre&s;ent for the occa&s;ion; but the Captain being anxious to get out to &s;ea, and join the Re&s;olution, did not think proper to accept of the invitation.</P>
<P>The &s;hort and imperfect intercour&s;e we had with the natives, did not enable us to form any accurate judgement of the form of government e&s;tabli&s;hed among&s;t them; but, from the general &s;imilarity of cu&s;toms, and particularly from what we ob&s;erved of the honours paid to their chiefs, it &s;eems rea&s;onable to imagine, that it is of the &s;ame nature with that which prevails in all the i&s;lands we had hitherto vi&s;ited; and, in all pro|bability, their wars among them&s;elves are equally frequent. This, indeed, might be inferred, from the number of weapons which we found in their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and from the excellent order in which they kept them. But we had proofs of the fact from their own confe&s;&s;ion; and, as we were in|formed, the&s;e wars are carried on between the different di&s;tricts of their own i&s;land, as well as
<PB N="188" REF="030274_0638_0FE571280537D890">
between it and the neighbouring inhabitants of the i&s;les of Oneeheow and Oreehoua. We &s;carcely need a&s;&s;ign any other cau&s;e be&s;ides this, to ac|count for the appearance, before-mentioned, of their population not being proportioned to the extent of their ground that is capable of culti|vation.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides their &s;pears, formed of a fine browni&s;h wood, beautifully poli&s;hed &s;ome of which are barbed at one end, and flattened to a point at the other, they had a kind of weapon which we had never met with before. It &s;omewhat re&s;embles a dagger, and is, in general, about eighteen inches in length; &s;harpened at one or both ends, and &s;ecured to the hand by a &s;tring. Its u&s;e is to &s;tab in clo&s;e combat, and it &s;eems well adapt|ed to that purpo&s;e. Some of the&s;e may be de|nominated double daggers, having a handle in the middle, with which they are the better enabled to &s;trike different ways. They have likewi&s;e bows and arrows; but both from their &s;lender con&s;truction, and their apparent &s;carcity, it is probable that they never make u&s;e of them in battle. The knife or &s;aw, already mentioned, with which they di&s;&s;ect the dead bodies of their enemies, may al&s;o be ranked among their wea|pons as they both &s;trike and cut with it when engaged in clo&s;e fight. It is a &s;mall flat wooden in&s;trument, about a foot in length, of an oblong &s;hape, rounded at the corners; its edges are &s;ur|rounded
<PB N="189" REF="030274_0639_0FE571298C149B08">
with &s;hark's teeth &s;trongly fixed to it, and pointing outwards; and it has generally a hole in the handle, through which pa&s;&s;es a long &s;tring, which they wrap &s;everal times round the wri&s;t. We al&s;o conjectured, that they u&s;e &s;lings on &s;ome occa&s;ions; for we procured &s;ome pieces of the <HI>haematites</HI> or blood-&s;tone, artificially made of an oval form, longitudinally divided with a narrow groove in the middle of the convex part. To this the per&s;on who had one of them appli|ed a thin cord, but would not di&s;po&s;e of it, though he was not unwilling to part with the &s;tone, which, as it weighed a pound, mu&s;t prove fatal when thrown with &s;ome degree of force. We likewi&s;e &s;aw &s;ome pieces of whet&s;tone neatly po|li&s;hed, of an oval figure, but &s;omewhat pointed towards each end; nearly re&s;embling in &s;hape &s;ome &s;tones &s;een by Captain Cook at New Cale|donia in 1774, and made u&s;e of there in &s;lings.</P>
<P>As &s;ome of their religious in&s;titutions, and their method of di&s;po&s;ing of their dead, &s;trong|ly indicate an affinity between the manners of the&s;e people and of the natives of the Friendly and Society I&s;lands, we will mention a few par|ticulars that will &s;erve to place this in a &s;triking point of view. The inhabitants of Tongataboo bury their dead with great decency, and they al&s;o inter their human &s;acrifices; but they do not, to our knowledge, offer any other animal, or even vegetable, to their deities. The Otaheiteans do
<PB N="190" REF="030274_0640_0FE5712B6038AC28">
not inter their dead, but expo&s;e them to wa&s;te by time and putrefaction, though they afterwards bury the bones; and, this being the ca&s;e, it is remarkable, that they &s;hould inter the intire bo|dies of their human &s;acrifices. They al&s;o offer up, to their gods, other animals and vegetables; but are far from being attentive to the condition of the places, where they celebrate tho&s;e &s;olemn rites; mo&s;t of their <HI>morais,</HI> being in a ruinous &s;tate, and &s;hewing manife&s;t tokens of neglect. The people of Atooi, again, bury, both their com|mon dead, and their human &s;acrifices, as at Ton|gataboo; but they re&s;emble tho&s;e of Otaheite, in offering vegetables and animals to their gods, and in the neglected &s;tate of their religious places.</P>
<P>The <HI>taboo</HI> al&s;o prevails in Atooi, in its full ex|tent, and apparently with greater &s;trictne&s;s than even at Tongataboo. For the natives here al|ways a&s;ked, with great eagerne&s;s, and with indi|cations of a fear of offending, whether any par|ticular thing, which they de&s;ired to &s;ee, or we were unwilling to &s;hew, was <HI>taboo,</HI> or (as they pronounced the word) <HI>tafoo?</HI> The <HI>mai raa,</HI> or prohibited articles at the Society I&s;lands, though undoubtedly the &s;ame thing, did not appear to be &s;o rigorou&s;ly ob&s;erved by them, except with regard to the dead: re&s;pecting whom we thought them more &s;uper&s;titious than any of the others were. The&s;e, however, are circum&s;tances con|cerning which we cannot pretend to &s;peak deci|&s;ively;
<PB N="191" REF="030274_0641_0FE5713189A67D50">
and we &s;hall only ob&s;erve, to &s;hew the &s;imilitude in other points connected with religi|on, that the <HI>tahounas,</HI> or prie&s;ts, &s;eem to be as numerous here as at the other i&s;lands.</P>
<P>But whatever re&s;emblance. we might di&s;cover between the general manners of the inhabitants of Atooi, and tho&s;e of Otaheite, the&s;e were le&s;s &s;triking than the &s;imilarity of language. Indeed, the languages of both places may be &s;aid to be almo&s;t entirely the &s;ame. The people of Atooi, in general, have neither the &s;trong guttural pro|nunciation of the New-Zealanders, nor that &s;maller degree of it, which al&s;o di&s;tingui&s;hes the Friendly I&s;landers; and they have not only adopt|ed the &s;oft mode of the Otaheitans, in avoiding har&s;h &s;ounds, but the whole idiom of their lan|guage; making u&s;e of the &s;ame affixes and &s;uf|fixes to their words, and the &s;ame mea&s;ure and cadence in their &s;ongs; at fir&s;t hearing, indeed, a &s;tranger may perceive &s;ome di&s;agreement; but it &s;hould be con&s;idered, that the natives of Ota|heite, from their frequent connections with the Engli&s;h, had learned, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, to adapt them&s;elves to our imperfect knowledge of their language, by u&s;ing the mo&s;t common and even corrupted expre&s;&s;ions in conver&s;ation with us; whereas, when they talked with each other, and u&s;ed the &s;everal parts nece&s;&s;ary to propriety of &s;peech, they were hardly at all under&s;tood by tho&s;e among us, who had made the greate&s;t progre&s;s
<PB N="192" REF="030274_0642_0FE571330FA82DC0">
in the knowledge of their vocabulary. A li&s;t of words was collected at Atooi, by the indefatigable Mr. Ander&s;on, who embraced every opportunity of rendering our voyage u&s;eful to tho&s;e who amu&s;e them&s;elves in tracing the emigrations of the various tribes that have peopled the globe, by the mo&s;t convincing of all arguments, that drawn from the coincidence of language.</P>
<P>How widely has this nation diffu&s;ed it&s;elf, in &s;o many detached i&s;lands, &s;o far di&s;tant from each other, in every quarter of the Pacific Ocean! We find it, from New-Zealand, in the &s;outh, as far as the Sandwich I&s;lands to the northward; and, in another direction, from Ea&s;tern I&s;land, to the New Hebrides: that is, over an extent of &s;ixty degrees of latitude, or three thou&s;and &s;ix hundred miles, north and &s;outh; and eighty three degrees of longitude, or four thou&s;and nine hundred and eighty miles, ea&s;t and we&s;t! How much farther, in either of tho&s;e directions, its colonies reach, is not known; but, from what we are already ac|quainted with, we are authorized in pronouncing it to be the mo&s;t exten&s;ive nation upon earth, though, perhaps, not the mo&s;t numerous.</P>
<P>If the Sandwich I&s;lands had been di&s;covered at an early period, by the Spaniards, they would doubtle&s;s have availed them&s;elves of &s;o excellent a &s;ituation, and have made u&s;e of Atooi, or &s;ome other of the i&s;lands, as a place of refre&s;hment for the &s;hips, that &s;ail annually between Manilla and

Acapulco. They lie almo&s;t midway between the la&s;t mentioned place and Guam, one of the La|drones, which is at pre&s;ent their only port in traver&s;ing this va&s;t ocean; and it would not have been a week's &s;ail out of their ordinary route, to have touched at them. An acquaintance with the Sandwich I&s;les would al&s;o have been equally favourable to our Buccaneers; who have &s;ome|times pa&s;&s;ed from the coa&s;t of America to the Ladrones, with a &s;tock of provi&s;ions and water &s;carcely adequate to the &s;upport of life. Here they might always have met with a plentiful &s;up|ply, and have been within a month's &s;ail of the very part of California, which the Manilla &s;hip is obliged to make. How happy would Lord An|&s;on have been, and what difficulties would he have avoided, had he known that there was a clu&s;ter of i&s;lands, half way between America and Tinian, where all his wants might have been ef|fectually relieved!</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE Di&s;covery having joined us, we &s;tood away to the northward, with a gentle gale from the ea&s;t. The tides are &s;o incon&s;iderable at the Sandwich I&s;lands, that with the great &s;urf breaking again&s;t the &s;hore, it was difficult, at all times to know whether we had high or low wa|ter, or wether it ebbed or flowed. On the &s;outh &s;ide of Atooi, a current generally &s;et to the we&s;t|ward, or north-we&s;tward. But, when we were at anchor off Oneeheow, we found a current &s;etting nearly north-we&s;t and &s;outh-ea&s;t, &s;ix hours each way. This was doubtle&s;s a regular tide, and the flood appeared to come from the north-we&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="195" REF="030274_0645_0FE5713DCF3E9680">But, to avoid digre&s;&s;ion, on Saturday the 7th of February, we were in the latitude of 29&deg; north and in the longitude of 200&deg; ea&s;t, the wind veer|ing to &s;outh-ea&s;t. We &s;teered north-ea&s;t and ea&s;t till the 12th, when the wind had veered round to north-ea&s;t and ea&s;t-north-ea&s;t. We then tacked and &s;tood to the northward, being in the latitude of 30&deg; north, and in the longitude of 206&deg; 15&prime; ea&s;t. In this advanced latitude, and even in the winter &s;ea&s;on, we had only begun to feel a &s;en&s;a|tion of cold in the mornings and evenings; a proof of the equal and durable influence of the heat of the &s;un, at all times to 30&deg; on each &s;ide the line. After that, the di&s;proportion is known to become very great. This mu&s;t be principally attributed to the direction of the &s;un's rays, in|dependent of the bare di&s;tance, which is not equal to the effect. On Thur&s;day the 19th of February, the wind veered to &s;outh-ea&s;t, and we were again enabled to &s;teer to the ea&s;t, inclining a little to the north. On the 25th, we reached the latitude of 42&deg; 30&prime;, and the longitude of 219&deg;; when we began to meet with the rock-weed, mentioned in Lord An&s;on's voyage, by the name of &s;ea-leek, which is generally &s;een by the Ma|nilla &s;hips. Sometimes a piece of wood appear|ed; but, if we had not known that we were near the continent of North America, we might have &s;uppo&s;ed, from the few &s;igns of vicinity of land that we had &s;een, that we were not within &s;ome

thou&s;and leagues of any. Since we left Sandwich I&s;lands we had hardly beheld a bird, or any other oceanic animal.</P>
<P>On the 1&s;t of March, we had a calm day, which was &s;ucceeded by a wind from the north, with which we &s;tood to the ea&s;t, intending to make land. We ought to have been near it, ac|cording to the charts. Such moderate and mild weather appeared to us very extraordinary, when we were &s;o far north, and &s;o near an exten&s;ive continent, at this time of the year. The &s;ea&s;on mu&s;t have been remarkably mild, for Sir Francis Drake met with very &s;evere cold, about this la|titude, even in the month of June<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Sir Francis Drake's Voyage, in Campbell's Edition of Harris, vol. i. p. 18.</NOTE>. Vi&s;caino, indeed, who was in the &s;ame part of the world, in the depth of winter, hardly takes notice of the cold, and mentions a ridge of &s;nowy mountains, on this coa&s;t, as &s;omething extraordinary <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Vanega's Hi&s;t. of California. vol. ii. p. 229.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>It is a &s;ingurlar circum&s;tance, that we &s;hould meet with &s;o few birds, compared to tho&s;e we &s;aw in the &s;ame latitudes, to the &s;outh of the line. This mu&s;t either proceed from a &s;carcity of them, or from a deficiency of re&s;ting-places. Hence it may be concluded, that, in the &s;outhern he|mi&s;phere, beyond 40&deg;, the &s;pecies are much more numerous, and the i&s;lands more plentifully &s;cat|tered,
<PB N="197" REF="030274_0647_0FE57141020A7DD0">
than any where near that latitude, between the coa&s;t of California and Japan.</P>
<P>On the morning of the 2d, during a calm part of the &s;ea appeared to be covered with a kind of &s;lime, and &s;ome &s;mall &s;ea animals were &s;een &s;wimming about. Tho&s;e which were mo&s;t con|&s;picuous, were of the gelatinous kind, almo&s;t globular; a &s;maller &s;ort had a white or &s;hining appearance, and were in great abundance. Some of the latter were put into a gla&s;s cup, with &s;ome &s;alt water; and, when in a prone &s;ituation, they appeared like &s;mall &s;cales or pieces of &s;ilver.</P>
<P>When they &s;wam about, which they did with equal ea&s;e in various directions, they emitted the brighte&s;t colours of the mo&s;t valuable gems, ac|cording to their po&s;ition re&s;pecting the light. At one time they appeared pellucid, at another di&s;playing the various tints of blue, from a &s;ap|phirine to a voilet, mixed with a kind of ruby, and glowing with &s;ufficient &s;trengh to illuminate the gla&s;s and water. When the ve&s;&s;el was held to the &s;tronge&s;t light, the tints appeared mo&s;t vivid; but almo&s;t vani&s;hed when the animals &s;ub|&s;ided to the bottom, and they had then a browni&s;h appearance. By candle-light, the colour, was principally, a beautiful pale green, with a kind of burni&s;hed glo&s;s; and, in the dark, it faintly exhibited a glowing fire.</P>
<P>They are a new &s;pecies of <HI>oni&s;cus</HI> and were called, by Mr. Ander&s;on, <HI>oni&s;cus fulgens;</HI> being

&s;uppo&s;ed to be an animal that contributes to that lucid appearance, often ob&s;erved at &s;ea, in the night. Two large birds &s;ettled, this day on the water, near the &s;hip. One was the <HI>procellaria maxima;</HI> and the other, of little more than half the magnitude of the former, appeared to be of the <HI>albatro&s;s kind.</HI> It was larger than a &s;ea-gull, but re&s;embled it in other re&s;pects. About noon, on the 6th, we beheld two &s;eals, and &s;everal whales; and early the next morning, the long-expected coa&s;t of New Albion <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">So named by Sir Francis D. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"></NOTE> was &s;een, at the di&s;tance of ten or twelve leagues, extending from north-ea&s;t to &s;outh ea&s;t. At noon, we were in the latitude of 44&deg; 33&prime; north, and in the longitude of 235&deg; 20&prime; ea&s;t and the land about eight leagues di&s;tant.</P>
<P>We had now &s;eventy-three fathoms water, over a muddy bottom, and found ninety fathoms about a league farther off. The land, which was of a moderate height, appeared to be diver&s;ified with hills and vallies, and principally covered with wood. No very &s;triking object, however, pre&s;ented it&s;elf, except an high hill, with a flat &s;ummit, which bore ea&s;t from us at noon. The land formed a point at the northern extreme, which Captain Cook named <HI>Cape Foulweather,</HI> from the exceeding bad weather we afterwards met with.</P>
<P><PB N="199" REF="030274_0649_0FE57146EEA3FCB8">After variable light airs and calms, at eight o'clock in the evening of 7th, a breeze &s;prung up at &s;outh-we&s;t. We &s;tood to the north-we&s;t, under an ea&s;y &s;ail, entending to range along the coa&s;t at day light. But, the next morning, at four, the wind having &s;hifted to north-we&s;t, it blew in &s;qualls, with rain. Till near ten o'clock our cour&s;e was north-ea&s;t: but, not being able to make any progre&s;s on this tack, and &s;eeing no|thing that had the appearance of an harbour, we tacked, and &s;tood off &s;outh-we&s;t. Cape Foul|weather, at this time, bore north-ea&s;t by north, di&s;tant about eight leagues.</P>
<P>In the evening of the 8th, the wind veered to the north-we&s;t, with &s;qualls, hail, and &s;leet; and, the weather being hazy and thick, we &s;tood out to &s;ea till about noon the next day, when we &s;tood in again for the land, which we &s;aw at two in the afternoon, bearing ea&s;t-north-ea&s;t. In the evening, the wind veered more to the we&s;t, and the weather grew wor&s;e, which obliged us to tack and &s;tand off till about four the next morning, when we &s;tood in again. In the afternoon, at four, we di&s;covered the land, which, at &s;ix, was about eight leagues di&s;tant. Here we tacked, and &s;ounded, but could not reach the ground with a line of one hundred and &s;ixty fathoms. We &s;tood off till near midnight, and then &s;tood in again. At half pa&s;t &s;ix, the next morning, we were about three leagues from the land. Seeing
<PB N="200" REF="030274_0650_0FE57149ED5A0BE0">
nothing like a harbour, and the weather continu|ing un&s;ettled, we tacked and &s;tretched off &s;outh-we&s;t, having then fifty-five fathoms water.</P>
<P>The land which we approached, when we tack|ed, is moderately high, but, in many places, it ri&s;es &s;till higher within. It is diver&s;ified with hills and ri&s;ing grounds, many of which are co|vered with tall &s;traight trees; and others, which were not &s;o high, grew in &s;pots, like clumps or coppices; but the &s;paces between, and the &s;ides of the ri&s;ing grounds, were clear.</P>
<P>Though, perhaps, as a &s;ummer pro&s;pect, this might be very agreeable, yet at this &s;ea&s;on, it had an uncomfortable appearance, the bare grounds along the coa&s;t being covered with &s;now, which &s;eemed to lie in abundance between hills and ri&s;ing grounds; and in many places, towards the &s;ea, had, at a di&s;tance, the appearance of white cliffs. On the ri&s;ing grounds, the &s;now was thin|ner &s;pread; and farther inland, there &s;eemed to be none at all. Hence it might, perhaps, be concluded, that the &s;now which we had &s;een to|wards the &s;ea, had fallen the proceeding night; which was, indeed the colde&s;t we had experi|enced &s;ince our arrival on that coa&s;t; and a kind of &s;leet &s;ometimes fell.</P>
<P>The coa&s;t appeared almo&s;t &s;traight in every part, not having any opening or inlet, and ter|minating in a kind of white &s;anday beach; though it was imagined by &s;ome on board, that &s;uch ap|pearance
<PB N="201" REF="030274_0651_0FE5714BC0C53078">
was owing to the &s;now. Each extreme of the land &s;hot out into a point; the northern one was that which we had &s;een on the 7th, and therefore Captain Cook called it <HI>Cape Perpetua.</HI> Its latitude is 44&deg; 6&prime; north, and its longitude 235&deg; 52&prime; ea&s;t. The &s;outhern extreme the Com|modore named <HI>Cape Gregory.</HI> It lies in the lati|tude of 43&deg; 30&prime;, and in the longitude 235&deg; 57&prime; ea&s;t. This point is rendered remarkable, by the land of it ri&s;ing immediately from the &s;ea, to a tolerable height, and that on each &s;ide of it is very low. We &s;tood off till almo&s;t one in the afternoon, and then tacked and &s;tood in, hoping in the night, to have the wind off from the land. We were, however, mi&s;taken, for, at five o'clock it veered to the we&s;t and &s;outh-we&s;t, which in|duced us once more to &s;tand out to &s;ea.</P>
<P>Cape Perpetua now bore north-ea&s;t by north; and the farthe&s;t land to the &s;outh of Cape Gre|gory, bore &s;outh by ea&s;t, di&s;tant about ten or twelve leagues. Its latitude will therefore be 43&deg; 10&prime;, and its longitude 235&deg; 55&prime; ea&s;t. This is nearly the &s;ituation of Cape Blanco, di&s;covered the 19th of January, 1603, by Martin d'Aguilar. It is remarkable that, in this very latitude, Geo|graphers have placed a large entrance or &s;trait, a&s;cribing the di&s;covery of it to the &s;ame naviga|tor; whereas nothing more is mentioned in his voyage, than his having di&s;covered a large river
<PB N="202" REF="030274_0652_0FE5714D46405F50">
in this &s;ituation, which he would have entered, but was hindered by the currents.</P>
<P>The wind was now very un&s;ettled, and blew in &s;qualls, with &s;now &s;howers. At midnight, it &s;hifted to we&s;t-north-we&s;t, and pre&s;ently in|crea&s;ed to a very hard gale with heavy &s;qualls, and &s;leet, or &s;now. We had not a choice now, but were obliged to &s;tretch to the &s;outhward, to get clear of the coa&s;t. This was done under more &s;ail than the &s;hips could bear with &s;afety, but it was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to avoid the more imminent danger of being forced on &s;hore. This gale abated at eight o'clock in the morning of the 13th, and then we &s;tood in again for the land. The wind remained at we&s;t and north-we&s;t. Storms, breezes, and calms, alternately &s;ucceed|ed each other, till the morning of the 21&s;t, when a breeze &s;prung up at &s;outh-we&s;t. This being accompanied with fair weather, we &s;teered north-ea&s;terly, hoping to fall in with the land, beyond where we had been to&s;&s;ed about for the preceding fortnight. In the evening the wind &s;hifted to the we&s;tward, and the next morning, about eight o'clock, we beheld the land at the di&s;tance of about nine leagues. Our latitude was now 47&deg; 5&prime; north, and our longitude 235&deg; 10&prime; ea&s;t. We &s;tood to the north, with a fine breeze, till near &s;even in the evening, when we tacked, in order to wait for day-light. We were now in forty-eight fathoms water, and four leagues from the
<PB N="103" REF="030274_0653_0FE57153E7BFCBE8">
land, extending from north to &s;outh-ea&s;t; and a &s;mall round hill, which we &s;uppo&s;ed to be an i&s;land, bore north three quarters ea&s;t, at the di&s;|tan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> of about &s;ix or &s;even leagues. It &s;eemed to be or a tolerable height, and could but ju&s;t be &s;een from the deck.</P>
<P>There appeared to be a &s;mall opening between this &s;uppo&s;ed i&s;land, and the northern extreme of the land; we therefore entertained &s;ome hopes of finding an harbour; but the&s;e hopes gradu|ally vani&s;hed as we drew nearer; and, at length, we were almo&s;t convinced that the opening was clo&s;ed by low land. The Commodore for this rea&s;on, named the point of land to the north of it, <HI>Cape Flattery.</HI> Its latitude is 48&deg; 15&prime; north, and its longitude 235&deg; 3&prime; ea&s;t.</P>
<P>All the land upon this part of the coa&s;t, is of a pretty equal height, is principally covered with wood, and has a very fertile appearance. In this very latitude, Geographers have placed the pre|tended &s;trait of Juan de Fuca. But nothing of that kind pre&s;ented it&s;elf to our view, nor is it probable that any &s;uch thing ever exi&s;ted. We &s;tood to the &s;outhward till <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">idnight, and then taked, and, with a gentle breeze at &s;outh-we&s;t, &s;teered to the north-we&s;t, intending, at day-light, to &s;tand in for the land. But, before that time, we had a very hard gale, with rain, right on &s;hore; in&s;tead therefore of running in for the land, we endeavoured to get an offing, or, at
<PB N="204" REF="030274_0654_0FE57155E1C153B0">
lea&s;t, to pre&s;erve that which we had already got. The &s;outh-we&s;t wind, however, did not continue long, for it veered again to the we&s;t before night.</P>
<P>Thus were we perpetually encountering with &s;trong we&s;t and north-we&s;t winds. In an even|ing, the wind would &s;ometimes become mode|rate, and veer &s;outhward; but this was a certain prelude to a &s;torm, which blew the harde&s;t at &s;outh-&s;outh-ea&s;t, and was generally accompanied with rain and &s;leet. In the cour&s;e of &s;ix hours, it was u&s;ually &s;ucceeded by a gale from the north-we&s;t, which introduced fair weather. About nine o'clock in the morning, of Sunday the 29th, we again &s;aw the land, the neare&s;t part about &s;ix leagues di&s;tant. We were now in the latitude of 49&deg; 29&prime; north, and in the longitude of 232&deg; 29&prime; ea&s;t.</P>
<P>The face of the country was very different from that of the parts which we had before &s;een; numbers of lo&s;ty mountains pre&s;ented them&s;elves to our view, who&s;e &s;ummits were covered with &s;now. The vallies between them, and the land towards the coa&s;t, were covered with high &s;traight trees, that appeared like a va&s;t fore&s;t. A low point was formed at the &s;outh-ea&s;t extreme of the land, off which are &s;everal breakers, occa&s;i|oned by &s;ome &s;unken rocks. It was therefore called <HI>Point Breakers.</HI> Its latitude is 49&deg; 15&prime; north, and its longitude 233&deg; 20&prime; ea&s;t. The la|titude of the other extreme is about 50&deg;, and the
<PB N="205" REF="030274_0655_0FE5715769F9AAA0">
longitude 232&deg;. This la&s;t was named <HI>Woody Point.</HI> It is high land, and projects to the &s;outh-we&s;t.</P>
<P>Between the&s;e two points, a large bay is form|ed, which the Commodore called <HI>Hope Bay</HI>; hop|ing, as he &s;aid, to find in it a good harbour; and the event proved that he was not mi&s;taken. As we approached the coa&s;t we &s;aw the appear|ance of two inlets; one of which was in the north-we&s;t, and the other in the north-ea&s;t corner of the bay. We bore up for the latter, and pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome breakers about a league from the &s;hore. Half a league without them, we had nineteen and twenty fathoms water; but, after we had pa&s;&s;ed them, the depth increa&s;ed to fifty fathoms; and farther in, the ground was unfathomable with the greate&s;t length of line.</P>
<P>Though appearances were in our favour, we were not yet certain that there were any inlets; but being in a deep bay, Captain Cook re&s;olv|ed to anchor, in order to endeavour to get &s;ome water, which we began to be much in need of. As we advanced, however, the exi&s;tence of the inlet no longer remained doubtful. About five o'clock, when we reached the we&s;t point of it, we were becalmed for &s;ome time. In this &s;itua|tion, the Commodore ordered all the boats to be hoi&s;ted out, in order to tow the &s;hips in. Pre|&s;ently a fre&s;h breeze &s;prung up at north-we&s;t, with which we &s;tretched up into an arm of the inlet,
<PB N="206" REF="030274_0656_0FE570F4790E9CF8">
which ran in to the north-ea&s;t. Here we were again becalmed, and found it nece&s;&s;ary to anchor in eighty-five fathoms water, and &s;o near the land as to be able to reach it with a haw&s;er. The Di&s;|covery was becalmed before &s;he got within the arm, where &s;he anchored in &s;eventy fathoms water.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as we approached the inlet, we per|ceived the coa&s;t to be inhabited; and three ca|noes came off to the &s;hip, at the place where we were fir&s;t becalmed; in one of which were two men, in another &s;ix, and in the other ten. Ad|vancing pretty near us, a per&s;on &s;tood in one of the two la&s;t, and &s;poke for a con&s;iderable time, inviting us, as we &s;uppo&s;ed by his ge&s;tures, to go a&s;hore; and, at the &s;ame time, continued &s;trew|ing handfuls of feathers towards us. Some of his companions al&s;o threw a red powder in the &s;ame manner.</P>
<P>The per&s;on who was the orator upon this oc|ca&s;ion, was clothed with the &s;kin of &s;ome ani|mal, and held &s;omething in each hand which rat|tled as he &s;hook it. At length, grown weary with his repeated exortations, of which we could not comprehend a word, he became quiet; and the others in their turn, had &s;omething to &s;ay to us; but their &s;peeches were neither &s;o long, nor &s;o vehement as that of the other. The hair of two or three of the&s;e people was &s;trewed over
<PB N="207" REF="030274_0657_0FE571594B27E178">
with &s;mall white feathers; and that of others, with large ones, &s;tuck into different parts.</P>
<P>The tumultuous noi&s;e having cea&s;ed, they lay at a &s;mall di&s;tance from the &s;hip, conver&s;ing toge|ther with much ea&s;e and compo&s;ure, without &s;hew|ing the lea&s;t di&s;tru&s;t or &s;urprize. Some of them ro&s;e, occa&s;ionally, and &s;aid &s;omething aloud, after the manner of their fir&s;t harangues; and one, in particular, &s;ung a mo&s;t agreeable air, accompani|ed with a great degree of melody and &s;oftne&s;s; the word <HI>haela</HI> b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing frequently repeated as the burden of the &s;ong.</P>
<P>A breeze &s;pringing up &s;oon after, brought us clo&s;er to the &s;hore, when the canoes began to vi&s;it us in great numbers; having had, at one time, no le&s;s than thirty-two of them about the &s;hip, containing from three to &s;even or eight per&s;ons each, and of both &s;exes. Several of the&s;e al&s;o &s;tood up and &s;pake aloud, u&s;ing the &s;ame ge&s;tures as our fir&s;t vi&s;itors. One canoe particularly at|tracted our ob&s;ervation, by a peculiar head, which had a birds eye, and an enormous large beak, painted on it. The per&s;on who was in it, and who appeared to be a chief, was equally remarka|ble for his &s;ingular appearance; having a large quantity of feathers hanging from his head and being painted or &s;meared in a very extraordinary manner. In this hand he had a carved bird of wood, of the &s;ize of a pigeon, with which he often rattled, like the per&s;on before-mentioned, and was
<PB N="208" REF="030274_0658_0FE5715F4552D6B8">
equally vociferous in his harangue, which was ac|companied with many expre&s;&s;ive ge&s;tures. Though our vi&s;itors were &s;o peaceable, that they could not be &s;u&s;pected of any ho&s;tile intention, not any of them could be prevailed upon to come on board. They were very ready, however, to part with any thing they had, and received whatever we offered them in exchange; but were more &s;olicitous after iron, than any of our other articles of commerce; appearing to be no &s;trangers to the u&s;e of that valuable metal.</P>
<P>We were followed, by many of the canoes, to our anchoring-place; and a group, con&s;i&s;ting of about ten or a dozen of them, continued along-&s;ide the Re&s;olution the greate&s;t part of the night.&mdash; Hence we flattered our&s;elves, that we were &s;o com|fortably &s;ituated, as to be able to get all our wants &s;upplied, and forget the delays and hard&s;hips we had experienced, in almo&s;t a con&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of adver&s;e winds and tempe&s;tuous weather, ever &s;ince we arrived upon this coa&s;t.</P>

Upon this &s;ervice, Captain Cook &s;ent three armed boats, under the command of Mr. King; and went him&s;elf, in a &s;mall boat, on the &s;ame bu&s;ine&s;s. He had no difficulty in finding what he wanted; for, on the north-we&s;t of the arm, and at a &s;mall di&s;tance from the &s;hips, he found a convenient &s;nug cove, perfectly adapted to our purpo&s;e. Mr. King was al&s;o &s;ucce&s;sful and found a &s;till better harbour, lying on the north-we&s;t &s;ide of the land. It would, however, have required more time to take the &s;hips thither, than to the cove where the Captain had been; there|fore his choice was determined in favour of the latter &s;ituation. But, apprehending that we could not tran&s;port our &s;hips to it, and moor them pro|perly, before night had overtaken us, he thought it prudent to continue where we were till the next morning.</P>
<P>Plenty of canoes, filled with the inhabitants, were about the &s;hips the whole day; and a re|ciprocal trade was commenced between us, which was conducted with the &s;tricte&s;t harmony and in|tegrity on both &s;ides. Their articles of com|merce where the &s;kins of various animals; &s;uch as bears, &s;ea-otters, wolves, foxes, deer, racoons, martins, and pole-cats. They al&s;o produced garments made of &s;kins; and another kind of
<PB N="211" REF="030274_0661_0FE57164713FE900">
cloathing, fabricated from the bark of a tree, or a plant re&s;embling hemp. Be&s;ides the&s;e articles, they had bows, arrows, and &s;pears; fi&s;h-hooks, and various kinds of in&s;truments; wooden vizors repre&s;enting horrid figures; a &s;ort of woollen-&s;tuff; carved work; beads; and red ochre; al&s;o &s;everal little ornaments of thin bra&s;s and iron, re&s;embling an hor&s;e-&s;hoe, which they were pen|dant at their no&s;es. They had likewi&s;e &s;everal pieces of iron fixed to handles, &s;omewhat re|&s;embling chi&s;&s;els. From their being in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the&s;e metals, it was natural for us to infer, that they mu&s;t either have been vi&s;ited before by per&s;ons of &s;ome civilized nation, or had con|nections with tho&s;e on their own continent, who had &s;ome communication with them.</P>
<P>Among all the articles, however, which they expo&s;ed to &s;ale, the mo&s;t extraordinary were hu|man &s;kulls, and hands, with &s;ome of the fle&s;h re|maining on them, which they acknowleged they had been feeding on; and &s;ome of them, indeed, bore evident marks of their having been upon the fire. From this circum&s;tance, it was but too apparent, that the horrid practice, of devouring their enemies, is practi&s;ed here, as much as at New-Zealand, and other South-&s;ea i&s;lands. For the various articles they brought, they received in exchange, knives, chi&s;&s;els, nails, looking-gla&s;&s;es, buttons, pieces of iron and tin, or any kind of metal. They had not much inclination
<PB N="212" REF="030274_0662_0FE5716A78F705E8">
for gla&s;s-beads, and rejected every kind of cloth.</P>
<P>The next day was employed in hauling our &s;hips into the cove, where they were moored. We found, on heaving up the anchor, notwith|&s;tanding the great depth of water, that rocks were at the bottom. The&s;e had greatly injured the cable, as well as the hau&s;ers that were carried out to warp the &s;hip into the cove, con&s;equently the whole bottom was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ewed with rocks. The &s;hip was now become very leaky in her upper works: the carpenters were therefore ordered to caulk her, and to repair any other defects they might di&s;cover.</P>
<P>In the cour&s;e of this day (the 31&s;t of March) the news of our arrival brought va&s;t numbers of the natives about our &s;hips. At one time we counted above a hundred canoes, each of which on an average, had five people on board; few containing le&s;s than three; many having &s;even, eight, or nine; and one was manned with &s;even|teen. Many of the&s;e were new vi&s;itors, which we di&s;covered by their orations and ceremonies when they approached the &s;hips.</P>
<P>If they, at fir&s;t, had apprehended that we meant to be ho&s;tile, their fears were now removed; for they ventured on board the &s;hips, and mixed with our people with the utmo&s;t freedom and fami|liarity. We di&s;covered, however, by this inter|cour&s;e, that they were as fond of pilfering as any
<PB N="213" REF="030274_0663_0FE5716C146A1EB8">
we had met with during our voyage: and they were much more mi&s;chievous than any of the other thieves we had found; for, having &s;harp in&s;truments in their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, they could, the in&s;tant that our backs were turned, cut a hook from a tackle, or a piece of iron from a rope.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides other articles, we lo&s;t &s;everal hooks in this manner, one of which weighed between twenty and thirty pounds. They &s;tripped our boats of every mor&s;el of iron that was worth tak|ing away, though &s;ome of our men were always left in them as a guard. They were, indeed, &s;o dextrous in effecting their purpo&s;es, that one fellow would contrive to amu&s;e our people at one end of the boat, while another was forcing off the iron-work at the other. If an article that had been &s;tolen, was immediately mi&s;&s;ed, the thief was ea&s;ily detected, as they were fond of impeaching each other. But the prize was al|ways reluctantly given up by the guilty per&s;on; and &s;ometimes compul&s;ive means were obliged to be exerci&s;ed for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Our &s;hips being &s;afely moored, we proceeded, the next day, to other nece&s;&s;ary bu&s;ine&s;s. The ob&s;ervatories were taken a&s;hore, and placed upon a rock on one &s;ide of the cove, not far from the Re&s;olution. A party of men was ordered to cut wood, and clear a place for watering. Having plenty of pine-trees here, others were employed in brewing &s;pruce-beer. The forge was al&s;o
<PB N="214" REF="030274_0664_0FE5716D9BB70C08">
erected to make the nece&s;&s;ary iron-work for re|pairing the fore-ma&s;t, which had one of the bib<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> defective, and was otherwi&s;e incomplete.</P>
<P>We were daily vi&s;ited by a con&s;iderable num|ber of the natives; and, among them, we fre|quently &s;aw new faces. They had a &s;ingular mode of introducing them&s;elves on their fir&s;t ap|pearance. They paddled, with their utmo&s;t &s;trength and activity, round both the &s;hips; a chief, all this time, &s;tanding up with a &s;pear in his hand, and &s;peaking, or rather bawling, mo&s;t vociferou&s;ly.</P>
<P>Sometimes the face of this orator was covered with a ma&s;k, repre&s;enting either a human coun|tenance, or that of &s;ome other animal; and, in|&s;tead of a &s;pear, he had a kind of rattle in his hand. Having made this ceremonious circuit round the &s;hip, they would come along-&s;ide, and then be|gin to traffic with us. Frequently, indeed, they would fir&s;t entertain us with a &s;ong, in which their whole company joined, and produced a very agreeable harmony. During the&s;e vi&s;its, our principal care was to guard again&s;t their thievery.</P>
<P>We had, however, in the morning of the 4th of April, a very &s;erious alarm. Our party, who were employed on &s;hore in cutting wood and filling water, ob&s;erved, that the natives, in all quarters, were arming them&s;elves in the be&s;t manner they were able; and that tho&s;e who had not proper weapons, were collecting &s;ticks and
<PB N="215" REF="030274_0665_0FE5716F792CCB88">
&s;tones. Hearing this, we thought it nece&s;&s;ary to arm al&s;o: but, being re&s;olved to act upon the defen&s;ive, the Commodore ordered all our work|men to repair to the rock, on which our ob&s;er|vatories had been placed, leaving the &s;uppo&s;ed enemy in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the ground where they had a&s;&s;embled, which was within about a hundred yards of the Re&s;olution's &s;tern.</P>
<P>Our danger, however, was only imaginary; for the&s;e ho&s;tile preparations were directed again&s;t a body of their own countrymen, who were ad|vancing to attack them. Our friends of the Sound, perceiving our apprehen&s;ions, exerted their be&s;t endeavours to convince us that this was really the ca&s;e. We &s;aw they had people look|ing out, on both &s;ides of the cove, and canoes were frequently di&s;patched between them and the main body. The adver&s;e party, on board of about a dozen large canoes, at length drew up in line of battle, off the &s;outh point of the cove, a negociation for the re&s;toration of peace having been commenced. In conducting the treaty, &s;everal people in canoes pa&s;&s;ed between the two parties, and &s;ome debates en&s;ued. At length the matter in di&s;pute appeared to be ad|ju&s;ted: but the &s;trangers were not permitted to ap|proach the &s;hips, nor to have any intercour&s;e or dealings with us.</P>
<P>We were probably the occa&s;ion of the quar|rel; the &s;trangers, perhaps, in&s;i&s;ting on having a
<PB N="216" REF="030274_0666_0FE570FA51876570">
right of &s;haring in the advantages of a trade with us; and our fir&s;t friends re&s;olving to engro&s;s as entirely to them&s;elves. We were convinced of this on many other occa&s;ions; nay, even among tho&s;e who lived in the Sound, the weaker were often obliged to &s;ubmit to the &s;tronger party, and were plundered of every thing, without even at|tempting to make any re&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>In the afternoon we re&s;umed out work, and, the next day, rigged the fore-ma&s;t; the head of which not being large enough for the cap, the carpenter was ordered to fill up the vacant &s;pace. In examining the &s;tate of the ma&s;t-head for this purpo&s;e, both cheeks were di&s;covered to be rotten; in&s;omuch that there was not a po&s;&s;ibility of re|pairing them. We were therefore obliged to get the ma&s;t out, and to &s;upply it with new ones.</P>
<P>Thus, when almo&s;t ready for &s;ea, all our work was to be done over again, and an additional re|pair was nece&s;&s;ary to be undertaken, which would require much time to be completed. It was, however, fortunate, that the&s;e defects &s;hould be di&s;covered, when we were &s;o commodiou&s;ly &s;itu|ated, as to be able to procure the materials that were requi&s;ite. For, in the cove where our &s;hips lay, there were &s;ome &s;mall &s;ea&s;oned trees, perfect|ly adapted for our purpo&s;e; and two new cheeks were immediately made from one of the&s;e. In the morning of the 7th of April, having got the fore-ma&s;t out, we hauled it a&s;hore, and the car|penters
<PB N="217" REF="030274_0667_0FE57175D4640050">
were &s;et to work upon it. Some of our lower &s;tanding rigging being much decayed, the Commodore embraced the opportunity, while the fore-ma&s;t was repairing, of ordering a new &s;et of main-rigging, to be fitted, and the fore-rigging to be improved.</P>
<P>From our putting into the Sound, till the 7th of April, the weather had been remarkably fine; but, in the morning of the 8th, the wind blew fre&s;h at &s;outh-ea&s;t, accompanied with hazy wea|ther and rain; it increa&s;ed in the afternoon, and in the evening it blew extremely hard. It came in heavy &s;qualls, right into the cove, from over the high land on the oppo&s;ite &s;hore; and, though the &s;hips were well moored, they were in a dangerous &s;ituation.</P>
<P>Though the&s;e tempe&s;tuous bla&s;ts &s;ucceeded each other quickly they were of &s;hort duration, and, in the intervals, we had a perfect calm. Another misfortune now befel us. On board the Re&s;olution, the mizen was the only ma&s;t that now remained rigged, with its top-ma&s;t up. The former was too defective to &s;upport the latter dur|ing the&s;e &s;qualls, and gave way at the head, under the rigging. The gale abated about eight o'clock; but the rain continued, almo&s;t without interm&s;&s;ion, for &s;evral days, during which time, a tent was erected over the fore-ma&s;t, that the carpenters might be enabled to proceed in their labours with &s;ome degree of convenience.</P>
<P><PB N="218" REF="030274_0668_0FE57177EB66CF30">The natives were not di&s;couraged, by this bad weather, from making us daily vi&s;its; and, in our &s;ituation, &s;uch vi&s;its were very acceptable to us. They frequently brought us a &s;upply of fi&s;h, when we were unable to catch any with a hook and line, and we had not a convenient place to draw a net. The fi&s;h they brought us were &s;mall cod, and a &s;mall kind of bream, or &s;ardine. On the 11th the main-rigging was fixed and got ever head, notwith&s;tanding the rainy weather; and, the next day, we took down the mizen-ma&s;t the head of which was &s;o rotten, that it dropped off in the &s;lings.</P>
<P>We received a vi&s;it, in the evening from a tribe of natives whom we had not &s;een before; and who, in general, made a better appearance than our old friends. The Commodore con|ducted them into the cabin, but there was not an object that demanded their attention; all our novelties were looked on with indifference, ex|cept by a very few, who &s;hewed a certain degree of curio&s;ity. The next day, a party of our men went into the woods, and cut down a tree, of which a mizen-ma&s;t was to be made. The day after it was conveyed to the place where the car|penters were at work upon the fore-ma&s;t. The wind, in the evening, veered to the &s;outh-ea&s;t, and blew a very hard gale, attended with rain, till eight o'clock the next morning; at which time it abated, and veered again to the we&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="119" REF="030274_0669_0FE570FC41F8B320">The fore-ma&s;t being now fini&s;hed we hauled it along &s;ide; but, on account of the bad weather, could not get it in till the afternoon. We were expeditious in rigging it, while the carpenters were employed on the mizen-ma&s;t on &s;hore. On the 16th, when they had made con&s;iderable pro|gre&s;s in it, they di&s;covered that the tree on which they were at work, was wounded, owing, it was imagined, to &s;ome accident in cutting it down. It therefore became nece&s;&s;ary to procure anothor tree out of the woods, on which occa&s;ion, all hands were employed above half a day.</P>
<P>During the&s;e operations, many of the natives were about the &s;hips, gazing on with an expre&s;|&s;ive &s;urprize, which, from their general inatten|tion, we did not expect. A party of &s;trangers, in &s;even or eight canoes, came into the cove on the 18th, and after looking at us for &s;ome time, retired. We apprehended that our old friends, who, at this time, were more numerous about us than our new vi&s;itors, would not &s;uffer them to have any dealings with us. It was evident, in|deed, that the neighbouring inhabitants engro&s;|&s;ed us entirely to them&s;elves, and that they car|ried on a traffic with more di&s;tant tribes, in tho&s;e articles they had received from us; for they frequently di&s;appeared for four or five days to|gether and returned with fre&s;h cargoes of curio|&s;ities and &s;kins.</P>
<P><PB N="220" REF="030274_0670_0FE570FDC8E2FA88">Such of the natives as vi&s;ited us daily, were the mo&s;t benificial to us; for, after di&s;po&s;ing of their trifles, they employed them&s;elvs in fi&s;hing, and we always partook of what they caught. We al&s;o procured from them a con&s;iderable quantity of good animal oil, which they brought to us in bladders. Some, indeed, attempted to cheat us, by mixing water with the oil; and once or twice, they &s;o far impo&s;ed upon us, as to fill their blad|ders with water only. But, it was better for us to wink at the&s;e impo&s;itions, than &s;uffer them to produce a quarel; for our articles of traffic chiefly con&s;i&s;ted of trifles, and we found it dif|ficult to produce a con&s;tant &s;upply even of the&s;e. Beads, and &s;uch like toys, of which we had &s;ome remaining, were not highly e&s;timated. Me|tal was principally demanded by our vi&s;itors: and bra&s;s had now &s;upplanted iron, being &s;ought after, with &s;uch eagerne&s;s, that, before we left the Sound, hardly a bit of it was to be found in the &s;hips, except what con&s;tituted a part of our nece&s;&s;ary in&s;truments. Suits of cloaths were &s;tripped of their buttons; bureaus of their fur|niture; kettles, cani&s;ters, and candle&s;ticks, all went to rack; &s;o that our American friends pro|cured from us a greater variety of things, than any other nation we had vi&s;ited.</P>
<P>Having had a fortnight's bad weather, Sunday the 19th being a fair day, we embraced the op|portunity of getting up the top-ma&s;ts and yards,
<PB N="221" REF="030274_0671_0FE571797386DB60">
and of fixing up the rigging. Mo&s;t of our heavy work being now fini&s;hed, the Commodore &s;et out the next morning to &s;urvey the Sound; and, going fir&s;t to the we&s;t point, he di&s;covered a large vil|lage, and, before it, a very &s;nug harbour, with from nine to four fathoms water.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of this village, who were nu|merous, many of whom the Commodore was no &s;tranger to, received him with great courte&s;y, every one pre&s;&s;ing him to enter his apartment; for &s;everal families have habitations under the &s;ame roof. He politely accepted the invitations, and the ho&s;pitable friends whom he vi&s;ited te&s;ti|fied every mark of civility and re&s;pect.</P>
<P>Women were employed, in many of the&s;e ha|bitations, in making dre&s;&s;es of the bark or plant already mentioned, and executed their bu&s;ine&s;s much like the inhabitants of New-Zealand. Others were bu&s;y in opening &s;ardines; large &s;hoals of which we have &s;een brought on &s;hore, and mea|&s;ured out to &s;everal people, who carried them home, where they performed the operation of curing them, which is done by &s;moke-drying. They are hung upon &s;mall rods; at fir&s;t, about a foot over the fire; they are then removed higher and higher to make room for others. When dried they are clo&s;ely packed in bales, and the bales covered with mats. Thus they are pre|&s;erved till they are wanted, and they are not un|plea&s;ant food. They al&s;o cure cod and other
<PB N="222" REF="030274_0672_0FE570FFA475A610">
large fi&s;h in the &s;ame manner; but the&s;e are &s;ome|times dried in the open air.</P>
<P>Leaving this village, the Commodore pro|ceeded up the we&s;t &s;ide of the Sound. For near three miles he &s;aw &s;everal &s;mall i&s;lands, &s;o &s;ituated <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s to form &s;ome convenient harbours, the depths being from thirty to &s;even fathoms. About two leagues within the Sound, on the &s;ame &s;ide, an arm runs in the direction of north-north-we&s;t, and another in the &s;ame direction about two miles further.</P>
<P>About a mile above the &s;econd arm, he found the ruins of a village. The framings of the hou&s;es remained &s;tanding, but the boards or roofs were taken away. Behind this de&s;erted village is a &s;mall plain, covered with the large&s;t pine trees that the Commodore had ever &s;een. This was indeed &s;ingular, as mo&s;t of the elevated ground on this &s;ide of the Sound appeared rather naked.</P>
<P>Pa&s;&s;ing from this place to the ea&s;t &s;ide of the Sound, Captain Cook found, what he had before imagined, that it was an i&s;land under which the &s;hips lay; and that many &s;maller ones lay &s;cat|tered on the we&s;t &s;ide of it. Upon the main land, oppo&s;ite the north end of our i&s;land, the Com|modore ob&s;erved a village, and landed there; but he was not &s;o politely received by the inha|bitants, as by tho&s;e of the other village he had vi&s;ited. This cold reception was occa&s;ioned by one &s;urly chief, who would not &s;uffer the Com|modore
<PB N="223" REF="030274_0673_0FE5717AFA31B480">
to enter their hou&s;es, but followed him wherever he went; making expre&s;&s;ive &s;igns that he was impatient for him to be gone. Captain Cook attempted, but in vain, to &s;ooth him with pre&s;ents; for, though he did not refu&s;e them, he continued the &s;ame kind of behaviour. But, not|with&s;tanding this treatment from the inho&s;pitable chief, &s;ome of the young women expeditiou&s;ly apparelled them&s;elves in their be&s;t, a&s;&s;embled in a body, and gave us a hearty welcome to the vil|lage, by joining in an agreeable &s;ong. Evening now drawing on, Captain Cook proceeded for the &s;hips round the north-end of the i&s;land.</P>
<P>When he returned on board, he was informed that, in his ab&s;ence, &s;ome &s;trangers, in two or three large canoes, had made a vi&s;it to the &s;hips; from whom our people under&s;tood, by &s;igns, that they had come from the &s;outh-ea&s;t. They brought with them &s;everal garments, &s;kins, and other ar|ticles, which they bartered for &s;ome of ours. But the mo&s;t remarkable circum&s;tance was, that two &s;ilver table-&s;poons were purcha&s;ed of them by our people, which appered to be of Spani&s;h manu|facture. They were worn round the neck of one of the&s;e vi&s;itors, by way of ornament.</P>
<P>On the 21&s;t, the mizen-ma&s;t was got in and rigged, and the carpenters ordered to make a new fore-top ma&s;t, to replace that which had been carried away. A number of &s;trangers vi&s;ited us about eight o'clock the next morning in twelve
<PB N="224" REF="030274_0674_0FE5717FC0DA52A0">
or thirteen canoes. They came from the &s;outh-ward; and when they had turned the point of the cove, they drew up in a body, where they re|mained about half an hour, at the di&s;tance of two hundred yards from the &s;hips. We imagined, at fir&s;t, they were afraid to approach; but in this we were mi&s;taken, for they were only making prepa|rations for an introductory ceremony.</P>
<P>At length they advanced towards the &s;hips, all &s;tanding up in their canoes, and began to &s;ing. Some of their &s;ongs were &s;low and &s;olemn, in which they were joined by the whole body; others were in quicker time, and their notes were regu|larly accompanied by the motions of their hands, their paddles beating in concert on the &s;ides of the canoes; and they, at the &s;ame time, exhi|bited the mo&s;t expre&s;&s;ive ge&s;tures. They re|mained &s;ilent, for a few &s;econds, after the con|clu&s;ion of each &s;ong, and then began again, fre|quently pronouncing the word <HI>hooee</HI> as a kind of chorus.</P>
<P>Having thus favoured us with a &s;pecimen of their mu&s;ic, with which we were highly enter|tained for half an hour, they came nearer the &s;hips and bartered with us. We now perceived that &s;ome of our old friends from the Sound were among them, who managed for the &s;trangers in the traffic between us and them.</P>
<P>The&s;e vi&s;itors being gone, the Captains Cook and Clerke went with two boats to the village at
<PB N="225" REF="030274_0675_0FE571824B499278">
the we&s;t point, where Captain Cook had been two days before, and had ob&s;erved that plenty of gra&s;s was to be had near it; and it was nece&s;&s;ary to get a &s;upply of this, for the few remaining goats and &s;heep which were &s;till on board. They expe|rienced the &s;ame welcome reception that Captain Cook had met with before; and, &s;oon after they were a&s;hore, the Commodore ordered &s;ome of his people to begin cutting; not imagining that the natives would object to our furni&s;hing our&s;elves with what could not be of any u&s;e to them, though e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary for us. In this, however, he was mi&s;taken, for as &s;oon as our men began cut|ting the gra&s;s, &s;ome of the inhabitants would not permit them to proceed, &s;aying, "<HI>makook,</HI>" which &s;ignified that we mu&s;t buy it fir&s;t.</P>
<P>The Commodore, at this time, was in one of he hou&s;es; but, hearing of this, he repaired im|mediately to the field, where he found about a dozen claimants of different parts of the gra&s;s that grew on the premi&s;es. The Commodore treated with them for it, and having complied with the terms of his purcha&s;e, thought we had now full liberty to cut wherever we plea&s;ed. Here he was again mi&s;taken; for he had &s;o libe|rally paid the fir&s;t pretended proprietors, that fre&s;h demands were made from others; &s;o that it almo&s;t appeared that every &s;ingle blade of gra&s;s had a &s;eparate owner; and &s;o many of them were to be &s;atisfied, that his pockets, pre&s;ently became

empty. When they were, however, convinced that he had nothing more to give, they cea&s;ed to be importunate, and we were permitted to cut where we plea&s;ed, and as much as we plea&s;ed.</P>
<P>It is worthy of ob&s;ervation, that we never met with any uncivillized nation, or tribe, who po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;uch &s;trict notions of their having an exclu|&s;ive property in the produce of their country, as the inhabitants of this Sound. They even wanted our people to pay for the wood and water that were carried on board. Had Captain Cook been pre&s;ent when the&s;e demands were made, he would doubtle&s;s have complied with them; but our workmen thought differently, and paid little or no attention to &s;uch claims. The natives think|ing we were determined to pay nothing, at length cea&s;ed to apply. But they frequently took occa|&s;ion to remind us, that their e&s;teem for us had induced them to make us a pre&s;ent of wood and water.</P>
<P>While they remained at this village, Mr. Web|ber, who attended the two Captains, thither, made a drawing of every thing that was thought cu|rious, both within doors and without. This he was well enabled to do, as he had an excellent opportunity of in&s;pecting narrowly, the con|&s;truction of their buildings, their furniture; and implements or uten&s;ils as well a the mo&s;t &s;triking peculiarities of the modes of living of the inha|bitants. Having, at length, completed all their
<PB N="227" REF="030274_0677_0FE57185AF178EA8">
operation at this village, the natives and the two Captains took a friendly leave of each other, and we returned to the &s;hips in the afternoon. The 23d, 24th, and 25th, of April were employed in preparing to put to &s;ea; the &s;ails were bent; the ob&s;ervatories and other articles removed from the &s;hore; and both &s;hips put into a proper condition for &s;ailing.</P>
<P>Thus prepared, we intended to have put to &s;ea on the morning of the 26th, but having both wind and tide again&s;t us, we were under a nece&s;&s;ity of waiting till noon; when a calm &s;ucceeded the &s;outh-we&s;t wind, and the tide, at the &s;ame time, turning in our favour, we towed the &s;hips out of the cove. We had variable airs and calms till about four in the afternoon, when a breeze &s;prung up, attended with thick hazy weather.</P>
<P>The mercury in the barometer &s;unk uncom|monly low, and we had every appearance of an approaching &s;torm from the &s;outhward. In this &s;ituation Captain Cook he&s;itated, for a &s;hort time, (as night was then approaching) whether he &s;hould &s;ail immediately, or &s;tay till the next morning. But his anxiety to proceed upon the voyage, and the fear of loo&s;ing &s;o good an oppor|tunity of getting out of the Sound, opperated more &s;trongly upon his mind than the apprehen&s;ions of danger, and he re&s;olved to put to &s;ea.</P>
<P>We were attended by the natives till we were almo&s;t out of the Sound; &s;ome in their canoes,
<PB N="228" REF="030274_0678_0FE571899B731D68">
and others on board the &s;hips. One of the thiefs, who had particularly attached him&s;elf to the Com|modore, was among the la&s;t who parted from us. The Commodore, a little time before he went, made him a &s;mall pre&s;ent for which he received, in return, a beaver &s;kin of a much &s;uperier value. This occa&s;ioned him to make &s;ome addition to his pre&s;ent, which plea&s;ed the chief &s;o highly, that he pre&s;ented to the Commodore the beaver-&s;kin cloak which he then wore, and of which he was particularly fond.</P>
<P>Struck with this in&s;tance of genero&s;ity, and wi&s;hing him not to be a &s;ufferer by his gratitude, Captain Cook in&s;i&s;ted upon his acceptance of a new broad-&s;word, with a bra&s;s hilt, with which he appeared greatly delighted. We were earne&s;tly importuned by the chief, and many of his coun|trymen, to pay them another vi&s;it; who, by way of inducement, promi&s;ed to procure a large &s;tock of &s;kins. Further particulars relative to the coun|try and its inhabitants, will furni&s;h materials for the two &s;ub&s;equent chapters.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>KING George's Sound was the appellation given by the Commodore to this inlet, on our fir&s;t arrival; but he was afterwards informed that the natives called it Nootka. The entrance is in the ea&s;t corner of Hope Bay; its latitude is 49&deg; 33&prime; north, and its longitude 233&deg; 12&prime; ea&s;t. The ea&s;t coa&s;t of that bay is covered by a chain of &s;unken rocks; and, near the Sound, are &s;ome i&s;lands and rocks above water. We enter the Sound between two rocky points, lying ea&s;t &s;outh-ea&s;t, and we&s;t north-we&s;t from each other, di&s;tant about four miles. The Sound widens within the&s;e
<PB N="230" REF="030274_0680_0FE5718D05B0F090">
points, and extends in to the northward at lea&s;t four leagues.</P>
<P>A number of i&s;lands, of various &s;ize, appear in the middle of the Sound. The depth of water, not only in the middle of the Sound, but al&s;o clo&s;e to &s;ome parts of its &s;hore, is from forty-&s;even to ninety fathoms, or more. Within its circuit, the harbours and anchoring-places are numerous. The cove, where our &s;hips anchored, is on the ea&s;t &s;ide of the Sound, and al&s;o on the ea&s;t of the large&s;t i&s;land. It is, indeed, covered from the &s;ea, which is its principal recommendation, for it is expo&s;ed to the &s;outh-ea&s;t winds, which &s;ome|times blow with great violence, and make great deva&s;tation, as was but too apparent in many places.</P>
<P>Upon the &s;ea-coa&s;t the land is tolerably high and level; but, within the Sound, it ri&s;es into &s;teep hills, which have an uniform appearance, ending in roundi&s;h tops with &s;harp ridges on their &s;ides. Many of the&s;e hills are high, and others are of a more moderate height; but all of them are covered to their tops with the thicke&s;t woods. Some bare &s;pots are to be &s;een on the &s;ides of &s;ome of the hills, but they are not nume|rous, though they &s;ufficiently &s;hew the general rocky di&s;po&s;ition of the&s;e hills. They have, in|deed, no &s;oil upon them, except what has been produced from rotten mo&s;&s;es and trees, of the depth of about two feet. Their foundation are,
<PB N="231" REF="030274_0681_0FE5718EDC0508E0">
indeed, nothing more than &s;tupendous rocks; which are of a grey or whiti&s;h ca&s;t when, expo&s;ed to the werther; but, when broken, are of a blui&s;h grey colour. The rocky &s;hore con&s;i&s;ts entirely of this; and the beaches of the little coves in the Sound are compo&s;ed of fragments of it.</P>
<P>During our &s;tay the weather nearly corre&s;ponded with that which we had experienced when we were off the coa&s;t. We had fine clear weather, if the wind was between north and we&s;t; but if more to the &s;outhward, hazy, accompanied with rain. The climate appears to be infinitely milder than that on the ea&s;t coa&s;t of America, under the &s;ame pa|rallel of latitude. We perceived no fro&s;t in any of the low ground; but, on the contrary, ve|getation proceeded very bri&s;kly, for we &s;aw gra&s;s, at this time, upwards of a foot long.</P>
<P>The trees, of which the woods are principally compo&s;ed, are the Canadian pine, white cypre&s;s, and two or three other &s;orts of pine. The two fir&s;t are in the greate&s;t abundance, and, at a di&s;|tance, re&s;emble each other; though they are ea|&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;hed on a nearer view, the cypre&s;s being of a paler green than the other. In gene|ral, the trees grow here with great vigour, and are of a large &s;ize. At this early &s;ea&s;on of the year, we &s;aw but little variety of other vegetable productions.</P>
<P>About the rocks, and borders of the woods&punc; we &s;aw &s;ome &s;trawberry plants, and ra&s;berry, cur|rant,
<PB N="232" REF="030274_0682_0FE5719258C5D3D0">
and goo&s;eberry bu&s;hes, all in a flouri&s;hing &s;tate. There were al&s;o a few black alder-trees; a &s;pecies of &s;ow-thi&s;tle; &s;ome crow's-foot with a fine crim&s;on flower, and two &s;orts of <HI>anthericum.</HI> We al&s;o met with &s;ome wild ro&s;e-bu&s;hes, ju&s;t budding; &s;ome young leeks, a &s;mall &s;ort of gra&s;s, and &s;ome water-cre&s;&s;es, be&s;ides a great abun|dance of <HI>andromeda.</HI> Within the woods are two &s;orts of underwood &s;hrubs, unknown to us, and &s;ome mo&s;&s;es and &s;erns.</P>
<P>The &s;ea&s;on of the year did not permit us to acquire much knowledge of the vegetable of this country; and it was impo&s;&s;ible, from our &s;itua|tion, to learn much about its animals. The want of water induced us to enter the Sound at fir&s;t; and the accidents that happened there, though they obliged us to &s;tay longer than we intended, were unfavourable to our acquiring any knowledge of this kind. It was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary that every per&s;on &s;hould be employed in forwarding the nece&s;&s;ary bu&s;ine&s;s of the &s;hips; which was the principal object, as the &s;ea&s;on was advancing, and the &s;ucce&s;s of the voyage depended upon their diligence in performing their &s;everal ta&s;ks. Excur&s;ions of any kind were, therefore, never attempted.</P>
<P>Lying in a cove, on an i&s;land, all the animals that we &s;aw alive were two or three racoons, mar|tins, and &s;quirrels; &s;ome of our people, indeed, who landed on the continent, on the &s;outh-ea&s;t
<PB N="233" REF="030274_0683_0FE57195010A9230">
&s;ide of the Sound, raw the prints of a bear's feet, not far from the &s;hore. The only account, there|fore, that we can furni&s;h of the quadrupeds, is taken from the &s;kins which were purcha&s;ed of the inhabitants; and the&s;e were &s;ometimes &s;o muti|lated in the heads, tails, and paws, that we could not even gue&s;s to what animals they belonged; though others were either &s;o perfect, or &s;o well known, they did not admit of a doubt about them. The mo&s;t common among them were bears, deer, foxes, and wolves. Bear-&s;kins were very plentiful, generally of a &s;hining black co|lour, but not very large. The deer &s;kins were not &s;o plentiful, and appeared to belong to what the hi&s;torians of Carolina call the fallow-deer; though Mr. Pennant di&s;tingui&s;hes it by the name of Virginian deer, and thinks it quite a different &s;pecies from ours. Their foxes are numerous, and of &s;everal varietes; the &s;kins of &s;ome being yellow, with a black tip at the tail; others, of a reddi&s;h yellow, intermixed with black; and others of an a&s;h colour, al&s;o intermixed with black.</P>
<P>When the &s;kins were &s;o mutilated as to admit of a doubt, our people applied the name of fox of wolf indi&s;criminately. At length, we met with an entire wolf's &s;kin, and it was grey. Here is the common martin, the pine martin, and ano|ther of a lighter brown colour. The ermine is al&s;o found in this country, but is &s;mall, and not very common: its hair is not remarkably fine
<PB N="234" REF="030274_0684_0FE57196913F11D0">
though the animal is entirely white, except about an inch on the tip of the tail. The racoons and &s;quirrels are &s;uch as are common, but the latter is not &s;o large as ours, and has a ru&s;ty colour extending the length of the back.</P>
<P>We were &s;ufficiently clear re&s;pecting the ani|mals already mentioned, but there were two others that we could not, with any certainty, di&s;tin|gui&s;h. One of them, we concluded to be the elk or mou&s;e deer; and the other was conjectured to be the wild cat or <HI>lynx.</HI> Hogs, dogs, and goats, have not yet made their appearance in this place. Nor have the natives any knowledge of our brown rats, to which they applied the name they gave to &s;quirrels, when they &s;aw them on board the &s;hips.</P>
<P>The &s;ea animals near the coa&s;t, are whales, porpoi&s;es, and &s;eals; the latter, from the &s;kins we &s;aw, &s;eeming to be of the common &s;ort. The porpoi&s;es is the <HI>Phocena.</HI> Though the &s;ea otter is amphibious, we &s;hall con&s;ider him as belong|ing to this cla&s;s, as living principally in the wa|ter. We doubted, for &s;ome time, whether the &s;kins, which the natives &s;old us for otter &s;kins, really belonged to that animal; but, a &s;hort time before our departure, a whole one, ju&s;t kill|ed, was purcha&s;ed from &s;ome &s;trangers, of which Mr. Webber made a drawing. It was young, weighing only twenty-five pounds; was of a glo&s;&s;y black colour, but many of the hairs being
<PB N="235" REF="030274_0685_0FE571986E4F29E0">
tipt with white, gave it, at fir&s;t &s;ight, a greyi&s;h ca&s;t. The face, throat, and brea&s;t, were of a light brown, or yellowi&s;h white; and, in many of the &s;kins, that colour extended the whole length of the belly. In each jaw it had &s;ix cutting teeth; two in the lower jaw being exceeding &s;mall, and placed without, at the ba&s;e of the two in the middle. In the&s;e re&s;pects, it differs from tho&s;e found by the Ru&s;&s;ians, and al&s;o in the outer toes of the hind feet not being &s;kirted with a mem|brane. There al&s;o appeared a greater variety in colour, than is mentioned by tho&s;e who de&s;cribe the Ru&s;&s;ian &s;ea otters. It is mo&s;t probable, that the&s;e changes of colour naturally take place at the different gradations of life. The very young ones had brown coar&s;e hair, with a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ittle fur un|derneath; but tho&s;e of the &s;ize of the animal ju&s;t de&s;cribed, had a greater quantity of that &s;ub|&s;tance. After they have attained their full growth, they lo&s;e the black colour, which is &s;ucceeded by a deep brown. At that period, they have a greater quantity of fine fur, and very few long hairs. Some, which we &s;uppo&s;ed to be older, were a che&s;nut brown; and we &s;aw &s;ome few &s;kins that were of a perfect yellow. The fur of the&s;e creatures is certainly finer than that of any other animal we know of; con&s;equently the di&s;|covery of this part of North America, where &s;o valuable an article of commerce is to be procured,
<PB N="236" REF="030274_0686_0FE5719D6A581298">
ought certainly to be con&s;idered as a matter of &s;ome con&s;equence.</P>
<P>Birds are far from being numerous here, and tho&s;e that are to be &s;een are remarkably &s;hy, ow|ing, perhaps, to their being continually harra&s;&s;ed by the natives, either to eat them, or become po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of their feathers to be worn as orna|ments. There are crows and ravens, not differ|ing, in the lea&s;t, from tho&s;e in England; al&s;o a jay or magpie; the common wren, which is the only &s;inging bird we heard; the Canadian thru&s;h; the brown eagle, with a white head and tail; a &s;mall &s;pecies of hawk; a heron, and the large-cre&s;ted American king-fi&s;her. There are al&s;o &s;ome that have not yet been mentioned by tho&s;e who have treated on natural hi&s;tory. The two fir&s;t are <HI>&s;pecies</HI> of wood peckers. One is &s;ome|what &s;maller than a thru&s;h, of a black colour on the back, having white &s;pots on the wings; the head, neck, and brea&s;t; of a crim&s;on colour, and the belly of a yellowi&s;h olive colour; whence it might with propriety, be called the yellow-bel|lied wood-pecker. The other is larger and more elegant; the back is of a du&s;ky brown colour, richly waved with black; the belly has a red|di&s;h ca&s;t, with black &s;pots; it has al&s;o a black &s;pot on the brea&s;t, and the lower part of the wings and tail are of a &s;carlet colour; the upper part blacki&s;h. A crim&s;on &s;treak runs on each &s;ide, from the angle of the mouth, a little down

the neck. The third and fourth are, one of th finch kind, not larger than a linnet, of a du&s;ky colour, black head and neck, and white bill; and a &s;and|piper, of a du&s;ky brown colour, with a broad white band acro&s;s the wings, of the &s;ize of a &s;mall pigeon. There are al&s;o humming birds, which differ, in &s;ome degree, from, the numerous &s;orts already known of this delicate little animal.</P>
<P>The quebrantahue&s;&s;os, &s;hags, and gulls, were &s;een off the coa&s;t; and the two la&s;t were al&s;o frequent in the Sound. There are two &s;orts of wild ducks; one of which was black, with a white head; the other was white, and had a red bill, but of a larger &s;ize. Here are al&s;o the greater <HI>lumme,</HI> or diver, which are found in our northern countries. Some &s;wans too, where once or twice &s;een flying to the northward, but we are unac|quainted with their haunts. On the &s;hores we found another &s;and-piper, about the &s;ize of a lark, and not unlike the burre: al&s;o a plover very much re&s;embling our common &s;ea-lark.</P>
<P>Though the variety of fi&s;h is not very great here, they are more plentiful in quantity than birds. The principal &s;orts are the common herring, which are very numerous, though not exceeding &s;even inches in length; a &s;maller &s;ort, which, though larger than the anchovy, or &s;ardine, is of the &s;ame kind; a &s;ilver-coloured bream, and another of a gold brown colour, with narrow blue &s;tripes. It is mo&s;t probable that the herrings, and &s;ardines,
<PB N="240" REF="030274_0689_0FE571A0791D1800">
had al&s;o pieces of rock cry&s;tal. The two fir&s;t articles were probable to be obtained near the &s;pot, as they had con&s;iderable quantities of them; but the latter, it may be &s;uppo&s;ed, came from a greater di&s;tance, or is extremely &s;carce; for our vi&s;itors would not part with it without a very va|luable con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>The &s;tature of the natives is, in general, below the common &s;tandard; but their per&s;ons are not proportionably &s;lender, being u&s;ually pretty plump, thou not mu&s;cular. Their &s;oft fle&s;hine&s;s, however, &s;eems never to &s;well into corpulence; and many of the older people are rather lean. Mo&s;t of the natives have round full vi&s;ages, which are &s;ometimes broad, with high prominent cheeks. Above the&s;e, the face frequently appears fallen in quite acro&s;s between the temples; the no&s;e flattens at its ba&s;e, has wide no&s;trils, and a rounded point. The forehead is low, the eyes &s;mall, black, and langui&s;hing; the mouth round, the lips thick, and the teeth regular and well &s;et, but not remark|able for their whitene&s;s.</P>
<P>Some have no beards at all, and others only a &s;mall thin one upon the point of the chin. This does not ari&s;e from an original deficiency of hair on that part, but from their plucking it out by the roots; for tho&s;e who do not de&s;troy it, have not only con&s;iderable beards on every part of the chin, but al&s;o wi&s;kers, or mu&s;tachias running from the upper lip to the lower jaw obliquely

downward<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is a mi&s;taken notion though e&s;pou&s;ed by eminent writers, that American Indians have no beards.

Their eye-brows are al&s;o &s;canty and narrow; but they have abundance of hair on the head, which is &s;trong, black, &s;traight, and lank. Their necks are &s;hort, and their arms are rather clum&s;y, having nothing of beauty or ele|gance in their formation. The limbs, in all of them, are &s;mall in proportion to the other parts; be&s;ides, they are crooked and ill-formed, hav|ing projecting ancles, and large feet aukwardly &s;haped.

<P>Their colour cannot be properly a&s;certained, their bodies being incru&s;ted with paint and na&s;|tine&s;s; though, when the&s;e have been carefully rubbed off, the &s;kin was little inferior in white|ne&s;s to that of the Europeans; though of that pali&s;h ca&s;t which di&s;tingui&s;hes the inhabitants of our &s;outhern nations. Some of them, when young, appear rather agreeable, when compared to the generality of the people; that period of life being attended with a peculiar degree of ani|mation; but, after a certain age, the di&s;tinction is hardly ob&s;ervable; a remarkable &s;amene&s;s cha|racterizes every countenance, dulne&s;s and want of expre&s;&s;ion being vi&s;ibly pourtrayed in every

<P>Their dre&s;s, in common, is a flaxen kind of mantle, ornamented with a narrow &s;tripe of fur on the upper edge, and fringes at the lower edge. Pa&s;&s;ing under the left arm, it is tied over the right &s;houlder, leaving both arms perfectly free. Sometimes the mantle is fa&s;tened round the wai&s;t by a girdle of coar&s;e matting. Over this is worn a &s;mall cloak of the &s;ame &s;ub&s;tance, reaching to the wai&s;t, al&s;o fringed at the bottom. They wear a cap like a truncated cone, or a flower-pot, made of very fine matting, ornamented with a round knob, or a bunch of leathern ta&s;&s;els, having a &s;tring pa&s;&s;ing under the chin, to prevent its blowing off.</P>
<P>The above dre&s;s is common to both &s;exes, and the men often wear, over their other garments, the &s;kin of &s;ome animal, as a bear, wolf, or &s;ea|otter, with the hair outwards; &s;ometimes tying it before, and &s;ometimes behind, like a cloak. They throw a coar&s;e mat about their &s;houlders in rainy weather, and they have woollen gar|ments which are but little u&s;ed. They generally wear their hair hanging loo&s;ely down; but, tho&s;e

<P>Their dre&s;s is certainly convenient, and, were it kept clean, would not be inelegant; but, as they are continually rubbing their bodies ov<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> with a red paint, mixed with oil, their garments become grea&s;y, and contract a rancid offen&s;ive &s;mell. The appearance, indeed, of the&s;e people, is both wretched and filthy, and their heads and garments &s;warm with lice. So lo&s;t are they to every idea of cleanline&s;s, that we frequently &s;aw them pick off the&s;e vermin, and eat them with the greate&s;t compo&s;ure.</P>
<P>Their bodies, it has been ob&s;erved, are always covered with red paint, but their faces are orna|mented with a variety of colours; a black, a brighter red, or a white colour; the la&s;t of the&s;e gives them a gha&s;tly horrible appearance. They like|wi&s;e &s;trew the brown martial <HI>mica</HI> over the paint, which cau&s;es it to glitter. Many of their ears are perforated in the lobe, where they make a large hole, and two &s;maller ones higher up on the outer edge. In the&s;e holes are hung bits of bone, quills fa&s;tened upon a leather thong, &s;hells, bunches of ta&s;&s;els, or thin pieces of copper. In &s;ome, the <HI>&s;eptum</HI> of the no&s;e is al&s;o perforated, and a piece of cord drawn through it. Others wear, at the &s;ame place, pieces of copper, bra&s;s, or iron, &s;haped &s;omewhat like a hor&s;e-&s;hoe, the nar|row opening receiving the <HI>&s;eptum,</HI> &s;o that it may

be pinched gently by the two points, and thus the ornament hangs over the upper lip. The rings of our buttons were eagerly purcha&s;ed, and appropriated to this u&s;e. Their bracelets, which they wear about their wri&s;ts, are bunches of white bugle beads, or thongs with ta&s;&s;els, or a broad black horny &s;hining &s;ub&s;tance.

At the &s;ame time the face is variously painted, the upper and lower parts being of oppo&s;ite colours, and the &s;trokes having the appearance of fre&s;h ga&s;hes; or it is be|&s;meared with a kind of fat or tallow, mixed with paint, formed into a great variety of figures, &s;ome|what like carved work.</P>

they are not to be reproached with any charge of peculiar in humanity. Their di&s;po&s;ition, in this re&s;pect, we had not any rea&s;on to judge unfavour|ably of.

<P>The&s;e fits of pa&s;&s;ion never extended farther than the parties immediately concerned; the &s;pectators never entering into the merits of the quarrel, whether it was with any of us, or among their own people; &s;hewing as much indifference, as if they were wholly unacquainted with the whole tran&s;action.

<P>Their indolence may, indeed, be a principal cau&s;e of this. But it mu&s;t be admitted, that they are not wholly un&s;u&s;ceptible of the tender pa&s;|&s;ions, which is evident from their being fond of mu&s;ic, and that too of the truly pathetic kind. Their &s;ongs are generally &s;low and &s;olemn; but their mu&s;ic is le&s;s confined than that which is u&s;ually found in other rude nations; the varia|tions being very numerous and expre&s;&s;ive, and the melody powerfully &s;oothing.

<P>Some of them di&s;played a di&s;po&s;ition to kna|very, and, in trafficking with us, took away our goods without making any return. But of this we had few in&s;tances, and we had abundant rea|&s;on to approve the fairne&s;s of their conduct. Their eagerne&s;s, however, to po&s;&s;e&s;s iron, bra&s;s, or any kind of metal, was &s;o great, that, when an opportunity pre&s;ented it&s;elf, few of them could re&s;i&s;t the temptation to &s;teal it. The natives of the South-&s;ea i&s;lands, as appears in many in&s;tances would &s;teal any thing they could find, without con&s;idering whether it was u&s;eful to them or not.

They were rather actuated by a childi&s;h curio&s;ity, than by a thievi&s;h di&s;po&s;ition. The inhabitants of Nootka, who made free with our property, are entitled to no &s;uch apology. The appellation of thief is certainly due to them; for they knew that what they pilfered from us, might be converted to the purpo&s;es of private utility;

<P>THE only inhabited parts of the Sound, &s;eem to be the two villages already mentioned. A pretty exact computation of the number of in|habitants in both, might be made from the canoes that vi&s;ited our &s;hips, the &s;econd day after our arrival. They con&s;i&s;ted of about a hundred, which upon an average, contained at lea&s;t five per&s;ons each. But, as there were very few women, old men, children, or youths, then among them, we may rea&s;onably &s;uppo&s;e, that the number of the inhabitants of the two villages could not be

le&s;s than four times the number of our vi&s;itors; beeing two thou&s;and in the whole.</P>
<P>The village which is &s;ituated at the entrance of the Sound, &s;tands on the &s;ide of a pretty &s;teep a&s;cent, extending from the beach to the wood. The hou&s;es con&s;i&s;t of three ranges or rows, placed at almo&s;t equal di&s;tances behind each other, the front row being the large&s;t; and there are a few &s;traggling hou&s;es at each end. The&s;e rows are inter&s;ected by narrow paths, or lanes, at irregular di&s;tances, pa&s;&s;ing upward; but tho&s;e between the hou&s;es are con&s;iderably broader. Though this general di&s;po&s;ition has &s;ome appearance of regu|larity, there is none in the re&s;pective hou&s;es; for every divi&s;ion made by the paths, may either be con&s;idered as one or more hou&s;es; there being no regular &s;eparation to di&s;tingui&s;h them by, either within or without. The&s;e erections con&s;i&s;t of very long broad planks, re&s;ting upon the edges of each other, tied, in different parts, with withes of pine-bark. They have only &s;lender po&s;ts on the out|&s;ide, at con&s;iderable di&s;tances from each other, to which they are al&s;o fa&s;tened; but there are &s;ome larger poles within, placed a&s;lant. The &s;ides and ends of the&s;e habitations are about &s;even or eight feet in height, but the back part is &s;omewhat higher. The planks, therefore, which compo&s;e the roof, &s;lant forward, and, being loo&s;e, may be moved at plea&s;ure. They may either be put clo&s;e
<PB N="254" REF="030274_0705_0FE571C9C596C940">
to exclude the rain, or &s;eparated to admit the light in fine weather.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, however, they are mo&s;t mi&s;e|rable dwellings, and di&s;play very little attention or ingenuity in their con&s;truction: for, though the &s;ide-planks are pretty clo&s;e to each other in &s;ome places, they are quite open in others. Be|&s;ides, the&s;e habitations have no regular doors, and can only be entered by a hole, which the unequal length of the planks has accidentally made. In the &s;ides of the hou&s;e they have al&s;o holes to look out at, &s;erving for windows; but the&s;e are very irregularly di&s;po&s;ed, without attending, in the lea&s;t, to the &s;hape and &s;ize of them.</P>
<P>Within the habitations, we have frequently a view from one end to the other of the&s;e ranges of building; for, though there are &s;ome appearances of &s;eparations on each &s;ide, for the accommoda|tion of different per&s;ons or families, they do not intercept the &s;ight; and generally con&s;i&s;t of pieces of plank, extending from the &s;ide to the middle of the hou&s;e. On the &s;ides of each of the&s;e parts is a little bench, about five or &s;ix inches higher than the re&s;t of the floor, covered with mats, whereon the family &s;it and &s;leep. The length of the&s;e benches is generally &s;even or eight feet, and the breadth four or five. The fire-place, which has neither hearth nor chimney, is in the middle of the floor. One hou&s;e in particular, was nearly &s;eparated from the re&s;t by a clo&s;e partition; and
<PB N="255" REF="030274_0706_0FE571CBEF9263F8">
this was the mo&s;t regular building of any we had &s;een. In it there were four of the&s;e benches, each holding a &s;ingle family at the corner; but it had not any &s;eparation by boards, and the middle of the hou&s;e &s;eemed to be common to all the inha|bitants.</P>
<P>The furniture of their hou&s;es con&s;i&s;ts princi|pally of che&s;ts and boxes of various &s;izes, piled upon each other, at the &s;ides or ends of the hou&s;e; in which are depo&s;ited their garments, &s;kins, ma&s;ks, and other articles that are deemed valu|able. Many of them are double, or the upper one &s;erves as a lid to the other: &s;ome have a lid fa&s;tened with thongs; others that are very large, have a &s;quare hole cut in the upper part, for the convenience of putting things in, or taking them out. They are frequently painted black, &s;tudded with the teeth of animals, or rudely carved with figures of birds, &amp;c. as decorations. They have al&s;o &s;quare and oblong pails; round wooden cups and bowls; wooden troughs, of about two feet in length, out of which they eat their food; bags of matting, ba&s;kets of twigs, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Their implements for fi&s;hing, and other things, are hung up, or &s;cattered in different parts of the hou&s;e, without any kind of order, making, in the whole, a perfect &s;cene of confu&s;ion; except on the &s;leeping benches, which have nothing on them but the mats, which are of a &s;uperior quality to
<PB N="256" REF="030274_0707_0FE571CD7662E5B8">
tho&s;e that they u&s;ually have to &s;it on in their boats.</P>
<P>The irregularity and confu&s;ion of their hou&s;es is, however, far exceeded by their na&s;tine&s;s and &s;tench. They not only dry their fi&s;h within doors, but they al&s;o gut them there; which, to|gether with their bones und fragments thrown upon the ground at meals, occa&s;ions &s;everal heaps of filth, which are never removed, till it becomes trouble&s;ome, from their bulk, to pa&s;s over them. Every thing about the hou&s;e &s;tinks of train-oil, fi&s;h, and &s;moke; and every part of it is as filthy as can be imagined,</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding all this filth and confu&s;ion, many of the&s;e hou&s;es are decorated with images; which are nothing more than the trunks of large trees, of the height of four or five feet, placed at the upper end of the apartment, with a human face carved on the front, and the hands and arms upon the &s;ides. The&s;e figures too are variou&s;ly painted, and make, upon the whole, a mo&s;t ridi|culous appearance. The&s;e images are generally called <HI>Klumma;</HI> but the names of two particular ones, &s;tanding abrea&s;t of each other, at the di&s;|tance of about three or four feet, were <HI>Natchkoa</HI> and <HI>Mat&s;eeta.</HI> A &s;ort of curtain, made of mat, u&s;ually hung before them, which the natives were &s;ometimes unwilling to remove: and when they did con&s;ent to unveil them, they &s;eemed to ex|pre&s;s them&s;elves in a very my&s;terious manner. It

&s;eems probable that they &s;ometimes make offer|ings to them; for, if we rightly interpreted their &s;igns, they reque&s;ted us to give &s;omething to the&s;e images, when they drew the mats from before them.</P>
<P>From the&s;e circum&s;tances, it was natural for us to &s;uppo&s;e that they were repre&s;entatives of their gods, or &s;ome &s;uper&s;titious &s;ymbols; and yet they were held in no very extraordinary degree of e&s;timation, for, with a &s;mall quantity of bra&s;s, or iron, any per&s;on might have purcha&s;ed all the gods in the place.</P>
<P>Mr. Webber, in drawing a view of the in&s;ide of a Nootka hou&s;e, wherein the&s;e figures are repre|&s;ented, was interrupted, and hindered from pro|ceeding, by one of the inhabitants. Thinking a bribe would have a proper effect upon this occa|&s;ion, Mr. Webber made him an offer of a button from his coat, which, being metal, immediately operated as it was intended, and he was at liberty to proceed as before. But &s;oon after he had made a beginning, he was again interrupted by the &s;ame man, who held a mat before the figures. He therefore gave him another button, and was &s;uffer|ed again to proceed. He then renewed his former practice, till Mr. Webber had parted with every &s;ingle button; and then permitted him to proceed without any farther ob&s;truction.</P>

The women al&s;o go in the &s;mall canoes, to gather mu&s;cles and other &s;hell-fi&s;h. They are as dexterous as the men in the management of the&s;e canoes; and when there are men in the canoes with them, they are paid very little attention to on account of their &s;ex, none of the men offering to relieve them from the labour of the paddle. Nor do they &s;hew them any particular re&s;pect or tenderne&s;s on other occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>The young men are remarkably indolent; being generally &s;itting about, in &s;cattered companies, ba&s;king them&s;elves in the &s;un, or wallowing in the &s;and upon the beach, like &s;o many hogs, without any kind of covering. This di&s;regard of de|cency was, however, confined &s;olely to the men. The women were always decently cloathed, and behaved with great propriety; ju&s;tly meriting all commendation for a mode&s;t ba&s;hfulne&s;s, &s;o be|coming their &s;ex.

them at our &s;hips, in the canoes; in which we under&s;tood they pa&s;s much of their time, e&s;pecially in the &s;ummer: for they not only eat and &s;leep frequently in them, but lie and ba&s;k them&s;elves in the &s;un, as we had &s;een them at their villiage. Their large canoes are, indeed, &s;ufficiently &s;pa|cious for that purpo&s;e; and are, except in rainy weather, more comfortable habitations than their filthy hou&s;es.</P>
<P>Their greate&s;t reliance for food &s;eems to be upon the &s;ea, as affording fi&s;h, and &s;ea-animals. The principal of the fir&s;t are herrings and &s;ar|dines, two &s;pecies of bream, and &s;ome &s;mall cod. The herrings and &s;ardines not only &s;erve to be eaten fre&s;h in their &s;ea&s;on, but to be dried and &s;moked as &s;tores. The herrings al&s;o afford them another grand re&s;ource for food; which is a va&s;t quantity of roe, prepared in a very extraordinary manner. It is &s;trewed upon &s;mall branches of the Canadian pine. It is al&s;o prepared upon a long &s;ea-gra&s;s, which is found, in great plenty, upon the rocks under water. This <HI>caviare</HI> is pre&s;erved in ba&s;kets of mat, and u&s;ed occa&s;ionally, after being dipped in water. It has no di&s;agreeable ta&s;te, and &s;erves the&s;e people as a kind of winter bread. They al&s;o eat the roe of &s;ome other large fi&s;h, that has a very rancid &s;mell and ta&s;te.</P>
<P>The large mu&s;cle is an e&s;&s;ential article of their food, which is found in great abundance in the Sound. After roa&s;ting them in their &s;hells, they
<PB N="260" REF="030274_0711_0FE571D8188D6298">
are &s;tuck upon long wooden &s;kewers, and taken off as they are wanted to be eaten, as they require no further preparation, though they are &s;ometimes dipped in oil, as a &s;auce. The &s;maller &s;hell-fi&s;h contribute to increa&s;e the general &s;tock, but can|not be con&s;idered as a material article of their food.</P>
<P>The porpoi&s;e is more common among them as food than any of the &s;ea-animals; the fle&s;h and rind of which they cut in large pieces, dry them as they do herrings, and eat them without far|ther preparation. They have al&s;o a very &s;ingular manner of preparing a &s;ort of broth from this animal, when in its fre&s;h &s;tate. They put &s;ome pieces of it in a wooden ve&s;&s;el or pail, in which there is al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">me water, and throw heated &s;tones into it. This operation is repeatedly performed till the contents are &s;uppo&s;ed to be &s;ufficiently &s;tewed. The fre&s;h &s;tones are put in, and the others taken out, with a cleft &s;tick, &s;erving as a pair of tongs; the ve&s;&s;el being, for that purpo&s;e, always placed near the fire. This is a common di&s;h among them, and &s;eems to be a very &s;trong nouri&s;hing food. From the&s;e, and other &s;ea-animals they procure oil in great abundance, which they u&s;ed upon many occa&s;ions, mixed with other food, as &s;auce, and frequently &s;ip it alone with a kind of &s;coop made of horn.</P>
<P>They probably feed upon other &s;ea-animals, &s;uch as whales, &s;eals, and &s;ea-otters; the &s;kins of
<PB N="261" REF="030274_0712_0FE548BBC4FF4FE8">
the two latter being common among&s;t them: and they are furni&s;hed with implements of all &s;orts for the de&s;truction of the&s;e different animals, though perhaps they may not be able, at all &s;ea|&s;ons, to catch them in great plenty. No great number of fre&s;h &s;kins were to be &s;een while we lay in the Sound.</P>
<P>The land-animals, at this time, appeared al&s;o to be &s;carce, as we &s;aw no fle&s;h belonging to any of them; and, though their &s;kins were to be had in plenty, they might, perhaps, have been procured by traffic from other tribes. It plainly appears, therefore, from a variety of circum&s;tances, that the&s;e people are furni&s;hed with the principal part of their animal food by the &s;ea; if we except a few gulls, and &s;ome other birds, which they &s;hoot with their arrows.</P>
<P>Their only winter vegetables &s;eem to be the Canadian pine-branches, and &s;ea-gra&s;s; but, as the &s;pring advances, they u&s;e others as they come in &s;ea&s;on. The mo&s;t common of the&s;e were two &s;orts of liliaceous roots, of a mild &s;weeti&s;h ta&s;te, which are mucilaginous and eaten raw. The next is a root called <HI>aheitu,</HI> and has a ta&s;te re&s;embling liquorice. Another &s;mall, &s;weeti&s;h root, about the thickne&s;s of <HI>&s;ar&s;aparilla,</HI> is al&s;o eaten raw. As the &s;ea&s;on advances, they have doubtle&s;s many others which we did not &s;ee. For though there is not the lea&s;t appearance of cultivation among them&punc; there are plenty of alder, goo&s;eberry, and
<PB N="262" REF="030274_0713_0FE571E1929F5198">
currant bu&s;hes. One of the conditions, however, which they &s;eem to require in all food, is, that it &s;hould be of the le&s;s acrid kind; for they would not touch the leek or garlic, though they &s;old us va&s;t quantities of it, when they under&s;tood we liked it. They &s;eemed, indeed, not to reli&s;h any of our food and rejected our &s;pirituous liquors as &s;omething digu&s;ting and unnatural.</P>
<P>Small marine animals, in their fre&s;h &s;tate, are &s;ometimes eaten raw; though it is their ordi|nary practice to roa&s;t or broil their food; for they are ab&s;olute &s;trangers to our method of boiling, as appears from their manner of preparing por|poi&s;e broth; be&s;ides, as they have only wooden ve&s;&s;els, it is impo&s;&s;ible for them to perform &s;uch an operation. Their manner of eating corre&s;|ponds with the na&s;tine&s;s of their hou&s;es and per|&s;ons; for the platters and troughs, out of which they eat their food, &s;eem never to have been wa&s;hed &s;ince their original formation; the dirty remains of a formal meal, being only &s;wept away by a &s;ucceeding one. Every thing &s;olid and tough, they tear to pieces with their hands and teeth; for though their knives are employed in cutting off the larger portion, they have not yet endeavoured to reduce the&s;e to mouthfuls by the &s;ame means, though &s;o much more cleanly and convenient. But they do not po&s;&s;e&s;s even an idea of cleanline&s;s, and con&s;tantly eat the roots which are dug from the ground, without at|tempting
<PB N="263" REF="030274_0714_0FE571E446704CD8">
to &s;hake off the &s;oil that adheres to them.</P>
<P>Whether they have any &s;et time for meals, we never certainly knew; having &s;een them eat at all hours in their canoes. But having &s;een &s;e|veral me&s;&s;es of porpoi&s;e broth preparing about noon, when we went to the village, they pro|bably make a principal meal about that time.</P>
<P>They have bows and arrows, &s;pears, &s;lings, &s;hort truncheons made of bone, and a &s;mall pick-axe, &s;omewhat re&s;embling the common American tomahawk. Some of the arrows are pointed with iron, and others with indented bone; the &s;pear has u&s;ually a long point made of bone. The tomahawk is a &s;tone of the length of &s;even or eight inches; one end terminating in a point, and the other fixed into a wooden handle. This handle is intended to re&s;emble the head and neck of a human figure; the &s;tone being fixed in the mouth &s;o as to repre&s;ent a tongue of great magnitude. To heighten the re&s;emblance, hu|man hair is al&s;o fixed to it. This weapon is called <HI>taawee&s;h;</HI> and they have another wea|pon made of &s;tone, which they call <HI>&s;eeaik,</HI> about ten or twelve inches long, having a &s;quare point.</P>
<P>It may be rea&s;onably concluded that they fre|quently engage in clo&s;e combat, from the num|ber of their &s;tone and other weapons; and we had very di&s;agreeable proofs of their wars being both
<PB N="264" REF="030274_0715_0FE571E5CE838F98">
frequent and bloody, from the quantity of human &s;kulls that were offered us to &s;ale.</P>
<P>The de&s;ign and execution of their manufac|tures and mechanic arts, are more exten&s;ive and ingenious than could po&s;&s;ibly have been expect|ed, from the natural di&s;po&s;ition of the people, and what little progre&s;s they had made in civi|lization. The flaxen and woollen garments en|gage their fir&s;t care, as being the mo&s;t material of tho&s;e that may be cla&s;&s;ed under the head of ma|nufactures. The former are fabricated from the bark of the pine-tree, beat into a ma&s;s re&s;embling hemp. After being prepared in a proper man|ner, it is &s;pread upon a &s;tick, which is fa&s;tened to two others in an erect po&s;ition. The manu|facturer, who &s;its on her hams at this &s;imple machine, knots it acro&s;s, at the di&s;tance of about half an inch from each other, with &s;mall plaited threads. Though it cannot, by this method, be rendered &s;o clo&s;e and firm as cloth that is woven, it is &s;ufficiently impervious to the air, and is like|wi&s;e &s;ofter and more pliable.</P>
<P>Though their woollen garments are probably manufactured in the &s;ame manner, they have much the appearance of a woven cloth; but, the &s;uppo&s;ition of their being wrought in a loom is de&s;troyed, by the various figures that are inge|niou&s;ly in&s;erted in them; it being very impro|bable that the&s;e people &s;hould be able to produce &s;uch a complex work, except immediately by
<PB N="265" REF="030274_0716_0FE571E7A5BCD7C8">
their hands. They are of different qualities; &s;ome re&s;embling our cour&s;e&s;t &s;ort of blankets; and others not much inferior to our fine&s;t &s;ort, and certainly both warmer and &s;ofter.</P>
<P>The wool, of which they are manufactured, &s;eems to be produced by different animals, parti|cularly the fox and brown lynx; that from the lynx is the fine&s;t, and nearly re&s;embles our coar&s;er wools in colour; but the hair, which al&s;o grows upon the animal, being intermixed with it, the appearance of it is &s;omewhat different when wrought. The ornamental figures in the&s;e gar|ments are di&s;po&s;ed with great ta&s;te, and are gene|rally of a different colour, being u&s;ually dyed ei|ther of a deep brown or a yellow; the latter of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hich, when new, equals in brightne&s;s the be&s;t in our carpets.</P>
<P>Their fondne&s;s for carving on all their wooden articles, corre&s;ponds with their ta&s;te in working fi|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">res upon their garments. Nothing is to be &s;een without a kind of freeze-work, or a repre&s;entation of &s;ome animal upon it; but the mo&s;t general figure is that of the human face, which is frequently cut out upon birds, and the other mon&s;trous things al|ready mentioned, and even upon their weapons of bone and &s;tone.</P>
<P>The general de&s;ign of the&s;e figures conveys a &s;ufficient knowledge of the objects they are in|tended to repre&s;ent; though, in the carving, very little dexterity is di&s;played. But, in the execu|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ion of many of the ma&s;ks and heads, they have
<PB N="266" REF="030274_0717_0FE571ED05657070">
&s;hewn them&s;elves ingenious &s;culptors. They pre&s;erve, with the greate&s;t exactne&s;s, the general character of their own faces, and fini&s;h the more minute parts with great accuracy and neatne&s;s. That the&s;e people have a &s;trong propen&s;ity to works of this &s;ort, is ob&s;ervable in a variety of par|ticulars. Repre&s;entations of human figures; birds; bea&s;ts; fi&s;h; models of their canoes, and hou&s;e|hold uten&s;ils, we found among them in very great abundance.</P>
<P>Having mentioned their &s;kill in &s;ome of the imitative arts, &s;uch as working figures in their garments, and engraving, or carving them in wood; we may al&s;o add their drawing them in colours. The whole proce&s;s of their whale fi&s;hery has been repre&s;ented, in this manner, on the caps they wear. This indeed, was rudely executed, but &s;erved, at lea&s;t, to convince us, that, though they have not the knowledge of letters among&s;t them, they have a notion of repre&s;enting actions, in a la&s;ting way, exclu&s;ive of recording them in their &s;ongs and traditions. They have al&s;o other painted figures, which, perhaps, have no e&s;tabli&s;h|ed &s;ignifications, and are only the creation of fan|cy or caprice.</P>
<P>Though the &s;tructure of their canoes is &s;imple, they appear well calculated for every u&s;eful purpo&s;e. The large&s;t, which contains upwards of twenty people, are formed of a &s;ingle tree. The length of many of them is forty feet, the breadth &s;e|ven, and the depth three. They become gra|dually
<PB N="267" REF="030274_0718_0FE571EEE99BF270">
narrower from the middle towards each end, the &s;tern ending perpendicularly, with a knob at the top. The fore-part &s;tretches for|wards and upwards, and ends in a point or prow, much higher than the &s;ides of the canoe, which are nearly &s;traight. The greate&s;t part of them are without any ornament; &s;ome have a little carving, and are &s;tudded with &s;eals' teeth on the &s;urface. Some have al&s;o a kind of additional prow, u&s;ually painted with the figure of &s;ome animal. They have neither &s;eats nor any other &s;upporters, on the in&s;ide, except &s;ome &s;mall round &s;ticks, about the &s;ize of a walking cane, placed acro&s;s, about half the depth of the canoe. They are very light and, on account of their breadth and flatne&s;s, &s;wim firmly, without an out-rigger, of which they are all de&s;titute. Their paddles, which are &s;mall and light, re&s;embles a large leaf in &s;hape, being pointed at the bottom, broad in the middle, and gradually becoming narrower in the &s;haft; the whole length being about five feet. By con&s;tant u&s;e, they have acquired great dexte|rity in the management of the&s;e paddles; but they never make u&s;e of any &s;ails.</P>
<P>For fi&s;hing and hunting, their in&s;truments are ingeniou&s;ly contrived, and completely made. They con&s;i&s;t of nets, hooks, and lines, harpoons, gigs, and an in&s;trument re&s;embling an oar. The lat|ter is about twenty feet in length, four or five inches in breadth, and of the thickne&s;s of half an
<PB N="268" REF="030274_0719_0FE571F0B8B6E7D8">
inch. The edges, for about two-thirds of its length, are &s;et with &s;harp bone-teeth, about two inches in length; the other third &s;erving for a handle. With this in&s;trument they attack her|rings and &s;ardines, and &s;uch other fi&s;h as come in &s;hoals. it is &s;truck into the &s;hoal, and the fi&s;h are taken either upon, or between the teeth. Their hooks, which are made of bone and wood, di&s;|play no great ingenuity; but the harpoon, which is u&s;ed in &s;triking whales, and other &s;ea-animals, manife&s;ts a great extent of contrivance. It con|&s;i&s;ts of a piece of bone, formed into two barbs, in which the oval blade of a large mu&s;cle-&s;hell, and the point of the in&s;trument, is fixed. Two or three fathoms of rope is fa&s;tened to this harpoon, and in throwing it, they u&s;e a &s;haft of about fifteen feet long, to which the rope is fa&s;tened; to one end of which the harpoon is fixed &s;o as to leave the &s;haft floating, as a buoy upon the water, when the animal is &s;truck with the harpoon.</P>
<P>We are &s;trangers to the manner of their catch|ing or killing land animals, but, it is probable, that they &s;hoot the &s;maller &s;orts with their ar|rows; and encounter bears, wolves, and foxes, with their &s;pears. They have &s;everal &s;orts of nets, which are perhaps applied to that purpo&s;e; it being cu&s;tomary for them to throw them over their heads, to &s;ignify their u&s;e, when they of|fered them for &s;ail. Sometimes they decoy ani|mals by di&s;gui&s;ing them&s;elves with a &s;kin, and
<PB N="269" REF="030274_0720_0FE571F24479F348">
running upon all fours, in which they are re|markably nimble; making, at the &s;ame time, a kind of noi&s;e, or neighing. The ma&s;ks, or carved heads as well as the dried heads of dif|ferent animals, are u&s;ed upon the&s;e occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>Every thing of the rope kind which they u&s;e in making their various articles, is formed either from thongs of &s;kins, and &s;inews of animals, or from the flaxen &s;ub&s;tance, of which they ma|nufacture their mantles. The &s;inews were &s;ome|times &s;o remarkably long, that it was hardly po&s;|&s;ible they could have belonged to any other ani|mal than the whale. The &s;ame conjecture may be hazarded with regard to the bones, of which they make their in&s;truments and weapons.</P>
<P>The a&s;&s;i&s;tance they receive from iron-tools, contributes to their dexterity in wooden per|formances. Their implements are almo&s;t wholly made of iron; at lea&s;t, we &s;aw but one che&s;&s;el that was not made of that metal, and that was only of bone. The knife and the che&s;&s;el are the principal forms that iron a&s;&s;umes among&s;t them. The chi&s;&s;el con&s;i&s;ts of a flat long piece, fa&s;tened into a wooden handle. A &s;tone is their mallet, and a bit of fi&s;h-&s;kin their poli&s;her. Some of the&s;e chi&s;&s;els were nine or ten inches in length, and three or four in breadth; but they were, in general, con&s;iderably &s;maller.</P>
<P>Some of their knives are very large, and their blades are crooked; the edge being on the back
<PB N="270" REF="030274_0721_0FE5720706C43168">
or convex part. What we have &s;een among them, were about the breadth and thickne&s;s of an iron-hop; and their &s;ingular form &s;ufficiently proves that they are not of European make. The&s;e iron-tools are &s;harpened upon a coar&s;e &s;late whet&s;tone, and the whole in&s;trument is kept con|tinually bright.</P>
<P>Iron is called by the natives <HI>&s;eekemaile,</HI> a name which they al&s;o give to tin, and other white metals. It being &s;o common among the&s;e peo|ple, we were anxious to di&s;cover how it could be conveyed to them. As &s;oon as we arrived in the Sound we perceived that they had a know|ledge of traffic and an inclination to pur&s;ue it; and we were afterwards convinced that they had not acquired this knowledge from a cur&s;ory in|terview with any &s;trangers, but it &s;eemed ha|bitual to them and was a practice in which they were well &s;killed.</P>
<P>With whom they carry on this traffic, we can|not a&s;certain; for, though we &s;aw &s;everal articles of European manufacture, or &s;uch, at lea&s;t, as had been derived from &s;ome civilized nation, &s;uch as bra&s;s and iron, it does not certainly follow that they were received immediately from the&s;e nations. For we never could obtain the lea&s;t in|formation of their having &s;een &s;hips, like ours, before, nor of their having been engaged in com|merce with &s;uch people. Many circum&s;tances corroborate to prove this beyond a doubt. On
<PB N="271" REF="030274_0722_0FE5720971019010">
our arrival, they were earne&s;t in their enquiries, whether we meant to &s;ettle among&s;t them, and whether we were friendly vi&s;itors; informing us, at the &s;ame time, that they freely gave us wood and water from motives of friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>This &s;ufficiently proves, that they con&s;idered them&s;elves as proprietors of the place, and dread|ed no &s;uperiority: for it would have been an un|natural enquiry, if any &s;hips had been here be|fore, and had &s;upplied them&s;elves with wood and water, and then departed; for they might then rea&s;onably expect that we &s;hould do the &s;ame. It mu&s;t be admitted, indeed, that they exhibited no marks of &s;urprize at beholding our &s;hips; but this may, with great propriety, be attributed to their natural indolence of temper, and their want|ing a thir&s;t of curio&s;ity. They were never &s;tartled at the report of a mu&s;quet, till they, one day, &s;hewed us that their hide-dre&s;&s;es were impene|trable to their &s;pears and arrows; when one of our people &s;hot a mu&s;quet ball through one of them that had been &s;ix times folded. Their a&s;to|ni&s;hment at this, plainly indicated their igno|rance of the effect of fire-arms. This was after|wards very frequently confirmed, when we u&s;ed them to &s;hoot birds, at which they appeared greatly confounded. And our explanation of the piece, together with the nature of its operation, with the aid of &s;hot and ball, &s;truck them &s;o
<PB N="272" REF="030274_0723_0FE5720B505E75D0">
forcibly, as to convince us of their having no previous ideas on this matter.</P>
<P>Though &s;ome account of a voyage to this coa&s;t, by the Spaniards, in 1774, or 1775, had arrived in England before we &s;ailed, the circum&s;tances ju&s;t mentioned &s;ufficiently prove, that the&s;e &s;hips had never been at Nootka<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It has &s;ince appeared, that they were not within two degrees of Nootka, and probably the inhabitants of that place never heard of the&s;e Spani&s;h &s;hips.</NOTE>. It was al&s;o evident, that iron would not have been in &s;o many hands, nor would the u&s;e of it have been &s;o well known, if they had &s;o lately obtained the fir&s;t knowledge of it.</P>
<P>From their general u&s;e of this metal, it pro|bably comes from &s;ome con&s;tant &s;ource, in the way of traffic, and they have perhaps been long &s;upplied with it; for they u&s;e their tools with as much dexterity as the longe&s;t practice can ac|quire. The mo&s;t natural conjecture, therefore, is, that they trade for their iron with other In|dian tribes, who may have &s;ome communication with European &s;ettlements upon that continent, or receive it through &s;everal intermediate nations. By the &s;ame means they probably obtain their bra&s;s and copper.</P>
<P>Not only the rude materials, but &s;ome manu|factured articles &s;eem to find their way hither. The bra&s;s ornaments for no&s;es are made in &s;o ma&s;terly a manner, that the Indians cannot be
<PB N="273" REF="030274_0724_0FE5720CD8548400">
&s;uppo&s;ed capable of fabricating them. We are certain, that the materials are European, as all the American tribes are ignorant of the method of making bra&s;s; though copper has been fre|quently met with, and, from its ductility, might ea&s;ily be fa&s;hioned into any &s;hape, and poli&s;hed. If &s;uch articles are not u&s;ed by our traders to Hud&s;on's Bay and Canada, in their traffic with the natives, they mu&s;t have been introduced at Nootka from Mexico; whence, it is probable, the two &s;ilver table &s;poons were originally de|rived.</P>
<P>Little knowledge can we be &s;uppo&s;ed to have acquired of the political and religious in&s;titu|tions e&s;tabli&s;hed among the&s;e people. We di&s;|covered, however, that there were &s;uch men as chiefs, di&s;tingui&s;hed by the title of <HI>Acweek,</HI> to whom the others are, in &s;ome degree, &s;ubordi|nate. But the authority of each of the&s;e great men, &s;eems to extend no farther than to his own family, who acknowledge him as their head. As they were not all elderly men, it is po&s;&s;ible this title may be hereditary.</P>
<P>Nothing that we &s;aw could give us any in&s;ight into their notions of religion, except the figures already mentioned, called <HI>Klumma.</HI> The&s;e, per|haps, were ido<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s; but, as the word <HI>acweek</HI> was frequently mentioned when they &s;poke of them, we may &s;uppo&s;e them to be the images of &s;ome of their ance&s;tors, who&s;e memories they venerate.

This, however is all conjecture, for we could receive no information concerning them; know|ing little more of their language than to enable us to a&s;k the names of things, and being inca|pable of holding any conver&s;ation with the na|tives, relative to their traditions, or their in&s;ti|tutions.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>WE have already mentioned, that we put to &s;ea, in the evening of the 26th of April, with manife&s;t indications of an approach|ing &s;torm; and the&s;e &s;igns did not deceive us. We had &s;carce &s;ailed out of the &s;ound, when the
<PB N="276" REF="030274_0727_0FE57216C81C85D8">
wind &s;hifted from north-ea&s;t to &s;outh-ea&s;t by ea&s;t, and blew a &s;trong gale, with &s;qualls and rain, the &s;ky being at the &s;ame time uncommonly dark. Being apprehen&s;ive of the winds veering more to the &s;outh, which would expo&s;e us to the dan|ger of a lee-&s;hore, we got the tacks on board, and made all the &s;ale we could to the &s;outh-we&s;t. It fortunately happened, that the wind veered no further towards the &s;outh, than &s;outh-ea&s;t; &s;o that, early the next morning, we were entirely clear of the coa&s;t. Captain Clerke's &s;hip being at &s;ome di&s;tance e&s;tern, the Commodore brought to, till &s;he came up, and then both ve&s;&s;els &s;teer|ed a north-we&s;terly cour&s;e. The wind blew with great violence, and the weather was thick and hazy. Between one and two o'clock in the af|ternoon, there was a perfect hurricane; &s;o that the Commodore deemed it exceedingly dange|rous to run any longer before it: he therefore brought the &s;hips to, with their heads to the &s;outh. In this &s;ituation, the Re&s;olution &s;prung a leak, in her &s;tarboard quarter, which, at fir&s;t alarmed us extremely; but, after the water was baled out, which kept us employed till mid|night, it was kept under by means of one pump. The wind having, in the evening, veered to the &s;outhward, its fury in &s;ome mea&s;ure abated; upon which we &s;tretched to the we&s;t; but about eleven, the gale again increa&s;ed, and continued
<PB N="278" REF="030274_0728_0FE5721860150728">
till five the next morning, when the &s;torm be|gan to moderate.</P>
<P>The weather now clearing up, we were able to &s;ee &s;everal leagues around us, and &s;teered more to the north. At noon, our longitude was 229&deg; 26&prime; ea&s;t: and our latitude, 50&deg; 1&prime; north. We now &s;teered north-we&s;t by north, with a fre&s;h gale, and fair weather. But, towards the even|ing, the wind again blew hard, with &s;qualls and rain. With this weather, we continued the &s;ame cour&s;e till the 30th, when we &s;teered north by we&s;t, intending to make the land. Captain Cook regretted that he could not do it &s;ooner, as we were now pa&s;&s;ing the &s;pot where the pretended &s;trait of Admiral de Fonte has been placed by geographers. Though the Captain gave no credit to &s;uch vague and improbable &s;tories, he was de|&s;irous of keeping the coa&s;t of America aboard, that this point might be cleared up beyond di&s;|pute. But he con&s;idered, that it would have been very imprudent to have engaged with the land while the weather was &s;o tempe&s;tuous, or to have lo&s;t the advantage of a fair wind, by wait|ing for le&s;s &s;tormy weather. This day, at twelve o'clock, our latitude was 53&deg; 22&prime; north, and our longitude 225&deg; 14&prime; ea&s;t.</P>
<P>On Friday, the 1&s;t of May, not &s;eeing land, we &s;teered to the north-ea&s;t, having a fre&s;h breeze at &s;outh-&s;outh-ea&s;t and &s;outh, with &s;qualls and &s;howers of hail and rain. About &s;even o'clock
<PB N="277" REF="030274_0729_0FE548C9F650EC28">
in the evening, we de&s;cried the land, at the di&s;|tance of twelve or fourteen leagues. At four the next morning, the coa&s;t was &s;een from &s;outh-ea&s;t to north by we&s;t, the neare&s;t part of it being five or &s;ix leagues di&s;tant. At this time, the northern point of an inlet, or, at lea&s;t, what appeared to be one, bore ea&s;t by &s;outh; and from it to the northward, there &s;eemed to be many bays and harbours along the coa&s;t. At &s;ix o'clock, mak|ing a nearer approach to the land, we &s;teered north-we&s;t by north, this being the direction of the coa&s;t; and between eleven and twelve, we pa&s;&s;ed a clu&s;ter of little i&s;lands &s;ituate near the continent, to the northward of the &s;outhern point of an exten&s;ive bay. An arm of this bay &s;eemed to extend in towards the north, behind a round lofty mountain that &s;tands between it and the &s;ea. To this mountain Captain Cook gave the name of Mount Edgecumbe; and the point of land projecting from it, he called Cape Edgecumbe. The latitude of this cape is 57&deg; 3&prime; north, and its longitude 224&deg; 7&prime; ea&s;t. The land, except in &s;ome parts clo&s;e to the &s;ea, is of a con&s;iderable height, abounding with hills. Mount Edeg|cumbe, which far out-tops all the re&s;t, was en|tirely covered with &s;now, as were al&s;o the other elevated hills; but the lower ones, and the flatter &s;pots near the &s;ea, were de&s;titute of it, and co|vered with wood.</P>
<P><PB N="279" REF="030274_0730_0FE5721F493884F8">In our progre&s;s to the northward, we found that the coa&s;t from Cape Edgecumbe trended to the north and north-ea&s;t for &s;ix or &s;even leagues, and there formed a &s;pacious bay. There being &s;ome i&s;lands in the entrance of this bay, the Commodore named it the Bay of I&s;lands. It &s;eemed to branch out into &s;everal arms, one of which turned towards the &s;outh, and may per|haps communicate with the bay on the ea&s;tern &s;ide of Cape Edgecumbe, and thus render the land of that cape an i&s;land. On the 3d, at half an hour after four in the morning, Mount-Edge|cumbe bore &s;outh 54&deg; ea&s;t, a large inlet, north 50&deg; ea&s;t; and the mo&s;t advanced point of land towards the north-we&s;t, lying under a very lofty peaked mountain, which obtained the appellation of Mount Fair-Weather, bore north 32&deg; we&s;t. The inlent we named Cro&s;s Sound, having fir&s;t ob&s;erved it on the day &s;o marked in our calen|dar. The &s;outh ea&s;tern point of this Sound is an elevated promontory, which we di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of Cro&s;s Cape. To the point under the above-mentioned peaked mountain, we gave the name of Cape Fair-Weather. At noon, this cape was di&s;tant twelve or thirteeen leagues.</P>
<P>We had now light breezes from the north-we&s;t, which continued &s;everal days. We &s;teered to the &s;outh we&s;t, and we&s;t-&s;outh-we&s;t, till the morning of the 4th, when we tacked and &s;tood towards the &s;hore. At twelve o'clock, Mount
<PB N="280" REF="030274_0731_0FE57220D01E7AE8">
Fair-Weather bore north 63&deg; ea&s;t, and the &s;hore under it was about a dozen leagues di&s;tant. This mount is the highe&s;t of a chain or ridge of moun|tains, that ri&s;e at the north-we&s;tern entrance of Cro&s;s Sound, and extend towards the north-we&s;t, parrellel with the coa&s;t. The&s;e mountains were covered with &s;now, from the highe&s;t &s;ummit down to the &s;ea-coa&s;t; except a few places, where we could di&s;cern trees that &s;eemed to ri&s;e, as it were, from the &s;ea. About five o'clock in the afternoon, the top of a high mountain appeared above the horizon, bearing north 26&deg; we&s;t; and, as we afterwards found, near forty leagues di&s;|tant. We &s;uppo&s;ed that it was the mount St. Elias, of Commodore Beering. We &s;aw, in the cour&s;e of this day, &s;everal porpoi&s;es, &s;eals, and whales; al&s;o great numbers of gulls, and many flocks of birds which had a black circle about the head, and a black band on the tip of the tail and upper part of the wings, the re&s;t being white below and bluei&s;h above. We likewi&s;e ob&s;erved a browni&s;h duck, with a blacki&s;h or dark blue head and neck.</P>
<P>As we had light winds, with occa&s;ional calms, we proceeded but &s;lowly. On the 6th, at mid|day, the neare&s;t land was at the di&s;tance of about eight leagues. In a north-ea&s;terly direction, there appered to be a bay, and an i&s;land near its &s;outhern point, covered with wood. This is pro|bably the place where Beering anchored. South|ward
<PB N="281" REF="030274_0732_0FE5722279FFEA68">
of the bay (which Captain Cook named Beering's Bay, in honour of its di&s;coverer) the ridge of mountains, already mentioned, is inter|rupted by a plain of &s;everal leagues in extent, be|yond which the &s;ight was unbounded. In the afternoon, we &s;ounded, and found a muddy bot|tom at the depth of about &s;eventy fathoms. Soon afterwards, having a light northerly breeze, we &s;teered to the we&s;tward; and at noon, the next day, we were at the di&s;tance of four or five leagues from the &s;hore. From this &s;tation we could per|ceive a bay under a high land, with low wood|land on each &s;ide of it. We now found that the coa&s;t trended con&s;iderably to the we&s;t; and as we had but little wind, and that chiefly from the we&s;tward, we made a &s;low progre&s;s. On the 9th, about noon, Mount St Elias bore north 30&deg; ea&s;t at the di&s;tance of nineteen leagues. This moun|tain &s;tands twelve leagues inland, in the longitude of 219&deg; ea&s;t, and in the latitude of 69&deg; 27&prime; north. It belongs to a ridge of very lofty mountains, which may be reckoned a kind of continuation of the former, being &s;eparated from them only by the plain before-mentioned.</P>
<P>On Sunday the 10th, at twelve o'clock, we were about three leagues di&s;tant from the coa&s;t of the continent, which extended from ea&s;t half north, to north-we&s;t half we&s;t. To the we&s;tward of the latter direction was an i&s;land, at the di&s;|tance of &s;ix leagues. A point which the com|modore
<PB N="282" REF="030274_0733_0FE5722459993130">
named Cape Suckling, projects towards the north-ea&s;tern end of this i&s;land. The extre|mity of the cape is low; but, within it, &s;tands a hill of a con&s;iderable height, which is divided from the mountains by low land; &s;o that the cape, at a di&s;tance, has an in&s;ular appearance. On the north &s;ide of Cape Suckling is a bay, which &s;eemed to be exten&s;ive, and to be &s;helter|ed from mo&s;t winds. Captain Cook had &s;ome thoughts of reparing to this bay, in order to &s;top the leak of his &s;hip, all our endeavours to effect that purpo&s;e at &s;ea having proved fruitle&s;s. We therefore &s;teered for the cape; but, having only variable light breezes, we advanced towards it &s;lowly. Before night, however we had approach|ed near enough to &s;ee &s;ome low land projecting from the cape to the north-we&s;t; we al&s;o ob&s;erv|ed &s;ome little i&s;lands in the bay, and &s;everal ele|vated rocks between the cape and the north-ea&s;tern extremity of the i&s;land. As there ap|peared to be a pa&s;&s;age on each &s;ide of the&s;e rocks, we continued &s;teering thither the whole night. Early the next morning, the wind &s;hifted from north-ea&s;t to north. This being again&s;t us, the Commodore relinqui&s;hed his de&s;ign of going into the bay, and bore up for the we&s;t end of the i&s;land. There being a calm about ten o'clock, he em|barked in a boat, and landing on the i&s;land, with a view of &s;eeing what lay on the other &s;ide; but finding that the hills were at a greater di&s;tance
<PB N="283" REF="030274_0734_0FE5722919D65D58">
than he expected, and that the way was woody and &s;teep, he laid a&s;ide that intention. On a &s;mall eminence near the &s;hore, he left, at the foot of a tree, a bottle containing a paper, on which the names of our &s;hips, and the date of our di&s;|covery, were in&s;cribed; he al&s;o inclo&s;ed two &s;ilver two-penny pieces of Engli&s;h coin, which, with many others, had been furni&s;hed him by Dr. Kay, now Dean of Lincoln; and, in te&s;timony of his e&s;teem for that gentleman, he di&s;tingui&s;hed the i&s;land by the name of Kay's I&s;land.</P>
<P>This i&s;le does not exceed twelve leagues in length, and its breadth is not above a league and a half in any part of it. The &s;outh-we&s;t point who&s;e latitude is 59&deg; 49&prime; north, and longitude 216&deg; 58&prime; ea&s;t, is a naked rock, con&s;iderably ele|vated above the land within it. There is al&s;o a high rock lying off it, which, when &s;een in &s;ome particular directions, has the appearance of a ru|inous ca&s;tle. The i&s;land terminates towards the &s;ea, in bare &s;loping cliffs, with a beach con&s;i&s;ting of large pebbles, intermixed in &s;ome places with a clayey &s;and. The cliffs are compo&s;ed of a bluei&s;h &s;tone or rock, and are, except in a few parts in a &s;oft or mouldering &s;tate. Some parts of the &s;hore are interrupted by &s;mall vallies and gullies, in each of which a rivulet or torrent ru&s;hes down with a con&s;iderable degree of impe|tuo&s;ity; though, perhaps, only furni&s;hed from the &s;now, and la&s;ting no longer than till the whole
<PB N="284" REF="030274_0735_0FE5722B0BD042F0">
is di&s;&s;olved. The&s;e vallies are filled with pine|trees; and they al&s;o abound in other parts of the i&s;land, which, indeed, is covered, as it were, with a broad girdle of wood. The trees, however, are far from being of an extraordinary growth; few of them &s;eeming to be larger than what a per|&s;on might gra&s;p round with his arms, and their general height being forty or fifty feet; &s;o that they would be of no great &s;ervice for &s;hipping, except as material for making top gallant ma&s;ts, and other &s;mall things. The pine-trees appeared to be all of one &s;pecies; and neither the Cana|dian pine, nor cypre&s;s, was to be &s;een.</P>
<P>Upon the edges of the cliffs, the &s;urface was covered with a kind of tuft, about &s;ix inches thick, apparently compo&s;ed of the common mor&s;e and the upper part of the i&s;land had nearly the &s;ame appearance in point of colour; but that which covered it, whatever it was, &s;eemed to be thicker. Among the trees were &s;ome currant and the leaves of other plants not yet in flower, particular one which was &s;uppo&s;ed by Mr. An|der&s;on to be the <HI>heracleum</HI> of Linnaeus.</P>
<P>A crow was &s;een flying about the wood; two or three white headed eagles, like tho&s;e of Noot|ka, were al&s;o ob&s;erved; be&s;ides another &s;pecies equally large, which had a white brea&s;t. The Commodore likewi&s;e &s;aw, in his pa&s;&s;age from the &s;hip to the &s;hore, a number of fowls &s;itting on
<PB N="285" REF="030274_0736_0FE5722C93496890">
the water; or flying about; the principal of which were gulls, burres, &s;hags, ducks, or large petrels, divers, and quebrantahue&s;&s;es. The divers were of two &s;orts; one very large, who&s;e colour was black, with a white belly and brea&s;t; the other of a &s;maller &s;ize, with a longer and more pointed bill. The ducks were al&s;o of two &s;pe|cies; one browni&s;h, with a dark-blue or blacki&s;h head and neck: the other &s;maller, and of a dirty black colour. The &s;hags were large and black, having a white &s;pot behind the wings. The gulls were of the common &s;ort, flying in flocks. There was al&s;o a &s;ingle bird flying about, ap|parently of the gull kind, who&s;e colour was a &s;nowy white, with &s;ome black along part of the upper &s;ide of its wings. At the place where our party landed, a fox came from the verge of the wood, and eyeing them with little emotion, walked lei&s;urely on without manife&s;ting any &s;igns of fear. He was not of a large &s;ize, and his colour was a reddi&s;h yellow. Two or three &s;mall &s;eals were likewi&s;e &s;een near the &s;hore; but no traces were di&s;covered of inhabitants having ever been in the i&s;land.</P>
<P>Captain Cook, with tho&s;e who accompanied him, returned on board in the afternoon, and with a light breeze from the ea&s;t, we &s;teered for the &s;outh we&s;t &s;ide of the i&s;land, which we got round by eight o'clock in the evening: we then &s;tood for the we&s;ternmo&s;t land that was now in &s;ight.
<PB N="286" REF="030274_0737_0FE5722E6780EE28">
At the north-ea&s;t end of Kay's I&s;land &s;tands ano|ther i&s;land, extending north-we&s;t and &s;outh-ea&s;t about nine miles, to within the &s;ame di&s;tance of the north-we&s;tern boundary of the bay mentioned before, to which the appellation of Comptroller's bay was given. Early the next morning Kay's I&s;land was &s;till in &s;ight, bearing ea&s;t by &s;outh; and, at this time, we were at the di&s;tance of four or five leagues from the main. At noon, the ea&s;tern point of a &s;pacious inlet bore we&s;t-north-we&s;t, about three leagues di&s;tant. From Comp|troller's Bay to this point, which the Commodore named Cape Hinchingbroke, the direction of the coa&s;t is nearly ea&s;t and we&s;t. Beyond this, it appeared to incline towards the &s;outh; a direction very different from that which is marked out in the modern charts, founded on the late di&s;coveries of the Ru&s;&s;ians; in&s;omuch that we had &s;ome rea|&s;on to expect, that we &s;hould find, through the inlet before us, a pa&s;&s;age to the north, and that the land to the we&s;t and &s;outh-we&s;t was a group of i&s;lands. The wind was now &s;outh-ea&s;terly, and we were menaced with a fog and a &s;torm; and Captain Cook was de&s;irous of getting into &s;ome place to &s;top the leak, before we had ano|ther gale to encounter. We therefore &s;teered for the inlet, which we had no &s;ooner reached, than the weather became exceedingly foggy, and it was deemed nece&s;&s;ary that the &s;hips &s;hould be &s;e|cured in &s;ome place or other, till the &s;ky &s;hould
<PB N="287" REF="030274_0738_0FE57234C4D044F0">
clear up. With this view we hauled clo&s;e under Cape Hinchingbroke, and ca&s;t anchor before a &s;mall cove, over a clayey bottom, in eight fa|thoms water, at the di&s;tance of about two fur|longs from the &s;hore.</P>
<P>Soon after we had anchored, the boats were hoi&s;ted out, &s;ome to fi&s;h, and others to &s;ound. The &s;eine, at the &s;ame time, was drawn in the cove; but without &s;ucce&s;s, as it was torn. At intervals the fog cleared away, and gave us a view of the neighbouring land. The cape was one league di&s;tant; the we&s;tern point of the inlet, five leagues; and the land on that &s;ide extended to we&s;t by north. Between this point and north-we&s;t by we&s;t, we could di&s;cern no land. The mo&s;t we&s;terly point we had in view on the north &s;hore, was at the di&s;tance of two leagues. Be|twixt this point, and the &s;hore under which our &s;hips now lay at anchor, is a bay about three leagues deep, on the &s;outh-ea&s;tern &s;ide of which are &s;everal coves; and, in the middle, &s;tand &s;ome rocky i&s;lands.</P>
<P>Mr. Gore was di&s;patched in a boat to the&s;e i&s;lands, in order to &s;hoot &s;ome birds that might &s;erve for food. He had &s;carcely reached them, when about twenty natives appeared, in two large canoes; upon which he retured to the &s;hips, and they followed him. They were unwilling, however, to venture along-&s;ide, but kept at a little di&s;tance, &s;houting aloud, and cla&s;ping and
<PB N="288" REF="030274_0739_0FE572364B4139C0">
extending their arms alternately. They then be|gan a kind of &s;ong, much after the manner of the inhabitants of King George's or Nootka Sound. Their heads were &s;trewed with feathers, and one of them held out a white garment, which we &s;up|po&s;ed was intended as a token of friend&s;hip; while another, for near a quarter of an hour, &s;tood up in the canoe, entirely naked, with his arms ex|tended like a cro&s;s, and motionle&s;s. Their canoes were con&s;tructed upon a different plan from tho&s;e of Nootka. The frame con&s;i&s;ted of &s;lender laths, and the out&s;ide was formed of the &s;kins of &s;eals, or other animals of a &s;imilar kind. Though we returned their &s;igns of amity, and endeavoured by the mo&s;t expre&s;&s;ive ge&s;tures, to encourage them to come along-&s;ide, we were unable to prevail upon them. Though &s;ome of our people repeat|ed &s;everal of the mo&s;t common words of the lan|guage of Nootka, &s;uch as <HI>mahook</HI> and <HI>&s;eekemaile,</HI> they did not appear to under&s;tand them. After they had received &s;ome pre&s;ents that were thrown to them, they retired towards the &s;hore, intimat|ing by &s;igns, that they would pay us another vi&s;it the next morning. Two of them, however, came off to us in the night, each in a &s;mall canoe; hoping, perhaps, that they might find us all a&s;leep, and might have an opportunity of pilfer|ing; for they went away as &s;oon as they perceived them&s;elves di&s;covered.</P>
<P><PB N="289" REF="030274_0740_0FE57237F6186768">The wind, during the night, blew hard and in &s;qualls, with rain, and thick hazy weather. The next morning, about ten, the wind becom|ing more moderate, and the weather in &s;ome mea&s;ure clearing up, we got up our anchors and made &s;ail, in order to &s;earch for &s;ome convenient place where we might &s;top the leak, as our pre|&s;ent &s;tation was two much expo&s;ed for that pur|po&s;e. Captain Cook at fir&s;t propo&s;ed to have gone up the bay before which our &s;hips had an|chored; but he was afterwards induced by the clearne&s;s of the weather, to &s;teer towards the north, further up the great inlet. After we had pa&s;&s;ed the north-we&s;t point of the above menti|oned bay, we found that the coa&s;t, on that &s;ide, inclined to the ea&s;tward. We did not follow it, but proceeded on our cour&s;e to the northward, for a point of land which we ob&s;erved in that direction.</P>
<P>The Americans who had vi&s;ited us the pre|ceding day, came off again in the morning, in five or &s;ix canoes; but as they did not come till after we were under &s;ail, they were unable to reach the &s;hips, though they followed us for a con&s;iderable time. In the afternoon, before two o'clock, the unfavourable weather returned, with &s;o thick a haze, that we could di&s;cern no other land but the point ju&s;t mentioned, off which we arrived between four and five o'clock, and found it to be a little i&s;land, &s;ituated at the di&s;tance of
<PB N="290" REF="030274_0741_0FE57239DD9BD968">
about two miles from the neighbouring coa&s;t, being a point of land on the ea&s;tern &s;ide of which we di&s;covered an excellent bay, or rather harbour. To this we plied up, while the wind blew in very hard &s;qualls, accompanied with rain. Though, at &s;ome intervals, we could &s;ee land in every direction, yet, in general, there was &s;o great a fog, that we could only perceive the &s;hores of the bay for which we were now &s;teering. In pa&s;&s;ing the i&s;land, we found a muddy bottom, at the depth of twenty-&s;ix fathoms. Not long after, we found &s;ixty and &s;eventy fathoms, over a rocky bottom; and, in the entrance of the bay, the depth of water was from thirty to &s;ix fathoms. At length, about eight o'clock, we were obliged, by the violence of the &s;qualls, to ca&s;t anchor in thirteen fathoms water, before we had proceeded &s;o far into the bay as the Commodore intended; but we thought our&s;elves fortunate in having the &s;hips already &s;ecured; for the night was extremely tempe&s;tuous.</P>
<P>Though the weather was &s;o turbulent, the na|tives were not deterred from paying us a vi&s;it. Three of them came off in two canoes; two men in one, and one in the other, being the num|ber that each canoe could carry. For they were con&s;tructed nearly in the &s;ame manner with tho&s;e of the E&s;quimaux, except that in one of them were two holes for two per&s;ons to &s;it in, and in the other but one. The&s;e men had each a &s;tick,
<PB N="291" REF="030274_0742_0FE5723E1A930638">
of the length of about three feet, with the large feathers, or wings of birds, fa&s;tened to it. The&s;e they frequently held up to us, probably as tokens of peace. The treatment the&s;e three received, induced many others to vi&s;it us, between one and two o'clock the following morning, in both great and &s;mall canoes. Some of them ventured on board the Re&s;olution, though not before &s;ome of our people had &s;tepped into their boats. Among tho&s;e who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ame on board, was a middle aged man, who, as we afterwards found, was the chief. His dre&s;s was made of the &s;kin of the &s;ea-otter, and he had on his head &s;uch a cap as is worn by the inhabitants of Nootka, embelli&s;hed with &s;ky-blue gla&s;s beads. He appeared to value the&s;e much more than our white gla&s;s beads. Any kind of beads, however, &s;eemed to be in high e&s;timation among the&s;e people, who readily gave in exchange for them whatever they had, even their fine &s;ea-otter &s;kin.</P>
<P>They were very de&s;irous of iron, but ab&s;olutely rejected &s;mall bits, and wanted pieces nine or ten inches long at lea&s;t, and of the breadth of three or four fingers. They obtained but little of this commodity from us, as, by this time, it was become rather &s;carce. The points of &s;ome of their &s;pears were of this metal; others were of copper; and a few were of bone; of which la&s;t the points of their arrows, darts, &amp;c. were formed.</P>
<P><PB N="292" REF="030274_0743_0FE57240477EF9D0">The chief could not be prevailed upon to ven|ture below the uper deck, nor did he and his companions continue long on board. While they were with us, it was nece&s;&s;ary to watch them narrowly, as they &s;oon manife&s;ted an inclination for thieving. At length, when they had been three or four hours along-&s;ide the Re&s;olution, they all quitted her, and reparied to the Di&s;co|very, which &s;hip none of them had before been on board of, except one man, who came from her at this very time, and immediately returned to her, in company with the others. As &s;oon as they had departed from our &s;hip, Captain Cook di&s;patched a boat to found the head of the bay, foras, the wind was moderate at pre&s;ent, he had an intention of laying the &s;hip a&s;hore, if a proper place could be found for the proce&s;s of &s;topping the leak. Soon afterwards all the Americans quitted the Di&s;covery, and made their way to|wards our boat that was employed in &s;ounding. The officer who was in her, ob&s;erving their ap|proach, returned to the &s;hip, and all the canoes followed him. The crew of the boat had no &s;ooner repaired on board, leaving in her, by way of guard, two of their number, then &s;everal of the natives &s;tepped into her; &s;ome of whom pre|&s;ented their &s;pears before the two men, while others loo&s;ed the rope by which &s;he was fa&s;tened to the &s;hip, and the re&s;t were &s;o daring as to at|tempt to tow her away. But the moment they
<PB N="293" REF="030274_0744_0FE57241CC3142F8">
&s;aw that we were preparing to oppo&s;e them, they let her go, &s;tepped out of her into their own boats, and made &s;igns to us to per&s;uade us to lay down our arms, being, to all appearance, perfectly un|concerned.</P>
<P>This attempt, though a very bold one, was &s;carce equal to what they had meditated on board Captain Clerke's &s;hip. The man whom we men|tioned before as having conducted his country|men from the Re&s;olution to the Di&s;covery, had fir&s;t been on board of the latter; where looking down all the hatchways, and ob&s;erving no one except the officer of the watch, and one or two others, he doubtle&s;s imagined that &s;he might be plundered with ea&s;e, particularly as &s;he was &s;ta|tioned at &s;ome di&s;tance from the Re&s;olution. It was unque&s;tionably with this intent, that the na|tives went off to her. Several of them went on board without the lea&s;t ceremony, and drawing their knives, made &s;igns to the officer, and the other people upon deck, to keep off, and began to &s;earch for plunder. The fir&s;t thing they laid hold of was the rudder of one of our boats, which they immediately threw overboard to tho&s;e of their party who had continued in the canoes. But before they had time to find another object that &s;truck their fancy, the &s;hips crew were alarmed, and many of them, armed with cutla&s;&s;es came upon deck. On ob&s;erving this, the plunderers all &s;neaked off into their canoes, with evident
<PB N="294" REF="030274_0745_0FE57243A33C1C70">
marks of indifference. It was at this time, that our boat was occupied in &s;ounding, as we have already mentioned; and the natives, without de|lay, proceeded towards her, after the di&s;appoint|ment they had met with at the Di&s;covery. Their vi&s;iting us &s;o early in the morning was undoubt|edly with a view of plundering, on a &s;uppo&s;ition that they &s;hould find all our people a&s;leep.</P>
<P>From the circum&s;tances above related, it may rea&s;onably be inferred, that the&s;e people are not acquainted with fire-arms. For, had they known any thing of their effect, they would by no means have ventured to attempt carrying off a boat from under, a &s;hip's guns, in the face of upwards of a hundred men; for mo&s;t of the Re&s;olution's peo|ple were looking at them, at the very in&s;tant of their making the attempt. However, we left them as ignorant, in this particular, as we found them; for they neither &s;aw nor heard a mu&s;quet fired, except at birds.</P>
<P>As we were on the point of weighing anchor, in order to proceed further up the bay, the wind began to blow as violently as before, and was at|tended with rain; in&s;omuch that we were oblig|ed to bear away the cable again, and lie fa&s;t. In the evening, perceiving that the gale did not abate, and thinking that it might be &s;ome time before an opportunity of getting higher up pre&s;ented it&s;elf, the Commodore was determined to heel the &s;hip in our pre&s;ent &s;tation: and, with
<PB N="295" REF="030274_0746_0FE5724A45A3CD48">
that view, cau&s;ed her to be moored with, a kedge|anchor and haw&s;er. One of the &s;ailors, in heav|ing the anchor out of the boat, was carried over|board by the buoy-rope, and accompanied the anchor to the bottom. In this very hazardous &s;ituation, he had &s;ufficient pre&s;ence of mind to di&s;engage him&s;elf, and come up to the &s;urface of the water, where he was immediately taken up, with a dangerous fracture in one of his legs, Early the following morning, we heeled the &s;hip, in order to &s;top the leak, which, on ripping off the &s;heathing, was found to be in the &s;eams. While the carpenters were employed in this bu|&s;ine&s;s, others of our people filled the water-ca&s;ks at a &s;tream not far from our &s;tation. The wind had, by this time, con&s;iderably abated; but the weather was hazy, with rain. The Americans paid us another vi&s;it this morning: tho&s;e who came off fir&s;t, were in &s;mall canoes; others ar|rived afterwards in large ones. In one of the&s;e great canoes were twenty women and one man, be&s;ides &s;everal children.</P>
<P>On Saturday the 16th, towards the evening, the weather cleared up, and we then found our&s;elves encompa&s;&s;ed with land. Our &s;tation was on the ea&s;tern &s;ide of the Sound, in a place di&s;tingui&s;h|ed by the appellation of Snug Corner Bay. Cap|tain Cook, accompanied by &s;ome of his officers, went to take a &s;urvey of the head of it; and they found that it was &s;heltered from all winds,
<PB N="296" REF="030274_0747_0FE5724BCFDDDBF0">
and had a muddy botto<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> at the depth of from &s;even to three fathoms. The land near the &s;hore is low; partly wooded, and partly clear. The clear ground was covered with &s;now, but very little remained in the woods. The &s;ummits of the hills in the neighbourhood were covered with wood; but tho&s;e that were at a greater di&s;tance inland, had the appearance of naked, rocks, in|volved in &s;now.</P>
<P>The leak of the Re&s;olution being at length &s;topped, we weighed anchor on the 17th, at four in the morning, and &s;teered a north-we&s;t cour&s;e, with a gentle breeze at ea&s;t-north-ea&s;t. Soon after we had made &s;ail, the Americans vi&s;ited us again, &s;eemingly with no other view than to gra|tify their curio&s;ity, for they did not enter into any traffic with us. When we had reached the north-we&s;tern point of the arm wherein we had achor|ed, we ob&s;erved that the flood-tide came into the inlet, by the &s;ame channel through which we had entered. This circum&s;tance did not much con|tribute to the probability of a pa&s;&s;age to the north through the inlet, though it did not make en|tirely again&s;t it. After we had pa&s;&s;ed the point ju&s;t mentioned, we met with much foul ground, and many &s;unken rocks. The wind now failed us, and was &s;ucceeded by calms and variable light airs, &s;o that we had &s;ome difficulty in extricat|ing our&s;elves from the danger that threatened us. At la&s;t, however, about one o'clock, we ca&s;t an|chor
<PB N="297" REF="030274_0748_0FE5724D96892A40">
in about thirtheen fathoms water, under the ea&s;tern &s;hore, about four leagues to the north|ward of our la&s;t &s;tation. Though the weather, in the morning, had been very hazy, it cleared up afterwards, &s;o as to afford us a di&s;tinct view of all the &s;urrounding land, particularly towards the north, where it appeared to clo&s;e. This gave us but little hope of meeting with a pa&s;&s;age that way. That he might be enabled to form a bet|ter judgment, Captain Cook &s;ent Mr. Gore, with two armed boats, to examine the northern arm; and at the &s;ame time di&s;patched the Ma&s;ter, with two other boats, to &s;urvey another arm that &s;eemed to incline towards the ea&s;t. Both of them returned at night. The Ma&s;ter informed the Commodore, that the arm, to which he had been &s;ent, communicated with that we had la&s;t quit|ted, and that one &s;ide of it was formed by a clu&s;ter of i&s;lands. Mr. Gore reported, that he had &s;een the entrance of an arm, which, he thought, extended a very con&s;iderable way to the north-ea&s;tward, and by which a pa&s;&s;age might probably be found. On the other hand, Mr. Roberts, one of the Mates, who had accompa|nied Mr. Gore on this occa&s;ion, gave it as his opinion, that they &s;aw the head of this arm. The variation of the&s;e two opinions, and the cir|cum&s;tance before-mentioned of the flood-tide en|tering the inlet from the &s;outhward, rendered the exi&s;tence of a pa&s;&s;age this way extremely uncer|tain.
<PB N="298" REF="030274_0749_0FE5724F1D8C50D8">
Captain Cook therefore determined to em|ploy no more time in &s;eeking a pa&s;&s;age in a place that afforded &s;o &s;mall a pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s, par|ticularly as the wind was now become favourable for getting out to &s;ea.</P>
<P>The next morning, about three o'clock, we weighed, and made &s;ail to the &s;outhward down the inlet, with a light northerly breeze. We met with the &s;ame broken ground as on the preceding day, but &s;oon extricated our&s;elves from it. We were enabled to &s;horten our way out to &s;ea, by di&s;covering another pa&s;&s;age into this inlet, to the &s;outh-we&s;t of that by which we entered. It is &s;eparated from the other, by an i&s;land that extends eighteen leagues in the di|rection of &s;outh-we&s;t and north-ea&s;t, to which Captain Cook gave the appellation of Montagu I&s;land.</P>
<P>There are &s;everal i&s;lands in the &s;outh-we&s;tern channel. Tho&s;e which are &s;ituate in the entrance, next the open &s;ea, are elevated and rockey. Tho&s;e that are within, are low; and as they were to|tally free from &s;now, and covered with wood and verdure, they were, for this rea&s;on, denominated Green-I&s;lands.</P>
<P>The wind, at two o'clock in the afternoon, veered to the &s;outh-we&s;t and &s;outh-we&s;t by &s;outh, which &s;ubjected us to the nece&s;&s;ity of plying. We fir&s;t &s;tretched over to within the di&s;tance of two miles of the ea&s;tern &s;hore, and tacked in about
<PB N="299" REF="030274_0750_0FE57252B35AED48">
fifty-three fathoms. As we &s;tood back to Mon|tagu I&s;land, we di&s;covered a ledge of rocks, &s;ome under water, and others above the &s;urface. We afterwards met with &s;ome others towards the middle of the channel. The&s;e rocks rendering it un&s;afe to ply during the night, we &s;pent it in &s;tanding off and on, under Montagu I&s;land; for the depth of water was &s;o great, that we could not ca&s;t anchor. The next morning, at break of day, we &s;teered for the channel between the Green I&s;lands and Montagu I&s;land, which is about two leagues and an half in breadth. The wind was incon&s;iderable the whole day; and, abou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> eight in the evening, we had a perfect calm; when we let go our anchors at the depth of twen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> one fathoms, over a muddy bottom, about the di&s;|tance of two miles from Montagu I&s;land. After the calm had continued till ten o'clock the &s;uc|ceeding morning, a &s;light breeze &s;prung up from the north with which we again weighed and made &s;ail. Having got out into the open &s;ea by &s;ix in the evening, we di&s;covered that the coa&s;t trended we&s;t by &s;outh, as far as the eye could po&s;&s;ibly reach.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE inlet which we had now quitted, was di&s;tingui&s;hed by Captain Cook with the name of Prince William's Sound. From what we &s;aw of it, it &s;eems to occupy, at lea&s;t, one degree and an half of latitude, and two degrees of longitude, exclu&s;ive of the branches or arms, with who&s;e exent we are unacquainted. The natives whom we &s;aw, were in general of a mid|dling &s;tature, though many of them were under it. They were &s;quare, or &s;trong-che&s;ted, with &s;hort thick necks, and large broad vi&s;ages, which were, for the mo&s;t part, rather flat. The mo&s;t di&s;proportioned part of their body appeared to be their heads, which were of great magnitude. Their teeth were of a tolerable whitene&s;s, broad, well &s;et, and equal in &s;ize. Their no&s;es had full round points, turned up at the tip, and

their eyes, though not &s;mall, were &s;carcely pro|portioned to the largene&s;s of their faces. They had black hair, which was &s;trong, &s;traight, and thick. Their beards were, in general, thin, or deficient; but the hairs growing about the lips of tho&s;e who have them, were briftly or &s;tiff, and often of a browni&s;h colour; and &s;ome of the elder|ly men had large, thick, &s;traight beards.</P>
<P>Though, for the mo&s;t part, they agree in the formation of their per&s;ons, and the largene&s;s of their heads, the variety in their features is con&s;i|derable. Very few, however, can be &s;aid to be hand&s;ome, though their countenance u&s;ually in|dicates frankne&s;s, vivacity, and good-nature; and yet &s;ome of them &s;hewed a re&s;erve and fullenne&s;s in their a&s;pect. The faces of &s;ome of the women are agreeable; and many of them, but principally the younger ones, may ea&s;ily be di&s;tingui&s;hed from the other &s;ex, by the &s;uperior delicacy of their features. The complexion of &s;ome of the females, and of the children, is white, without any mixture of red. Many of the men, whom we &s;aw naked, had father a &s;warthy ca&s;t, which was &s;carcely the effect of any &s;tain, as it is not their cu&s;tom to paint their bodies.</P>
<P>The men, women, and children of this Sound, are all clothed in the &s;ame manner. Their or|dinary dre&s;s is a &s;ort of clo&s;e frock, or rather robe, which &s;ometimes reaches only to the knees, but generally down to the ancles. It has, at the up|per
<PB N="302" REF="030274_0755_0FE57259308BE310">
part, a hole ju&s;t &s;ufficient to admit the head, with &s;leeves reaching to the wri&s;t. The&s;e frocks are compo&s;ed of the &s;kins of various animals, &s;uch as the grey fox, racoon, pine-martin, &s;ea-otter, &s;eal, &amp;c. And they are commonly worn with the hairy &s;ide outwards. Some of the na|tives have their frocks made of the &s;kins of fowls, with only the down left on them, which they glue upon other &s;ub&s;tances: we al&s;o &s;aw one or two woollen garments, re&s;embling tho&s;e of the inhabitants of King George's Sound. At the &s;eams, where the different &s;kins are &s;ewed to|gether, they are u&s;ually adorned with fringes or ta&s;&s;els of narrow thongs, cut out of the &s;ame &s;kins. There is a &s;ort of cape or collar to a few of them, and &s;ome have a hood; but the other is the mo&s;t cu&s;tomary form, and appears to con|&s;titute their whole dre&s;s in fair weather. They put over this, when it is rainy, another frock, made with &s;ome degree of ingenuity from the inte&s;tines of whales, or of &s;ome other large ani|mal, prepared with &s;uch &s;kill, as to re&s;emble, in a great mea&s;ure, our gold-beater's leaf. It is formed &s;o as to be drawn tight round the neck; and its &s;leeves extend down to the wri&s;t, round which they are fa&s;tened with a &s;tring. When they are in their canoes, they draw the &s;kirts of this frock over the rim of the hole in which they &s;it, &s;o that the water is prevented from entering. At the &s;ame time it keeps the men dry upwards,
<PB N="303" REF="030274_0756_0FE5725D08CA6978">
for no water can penetrate through it. It is apt to crack or break, if it is not con&s;tantly kept moi&s;t. This frock, as well as the common one made of &s;kins, is nearly &s;imilar to the dre&s;s of the natives of Greenland, as de&s;cribed by Crantz<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Crantz's Hi&s;tory of Greenland, Vol. I. p. 136&mdash;138.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Though the inhabitants of this inlet in gene|ral, do not cover their legs or feet, yet &s;ome of them wear a kind of &s;kin &s;tockings, reaching half-way up their thighs. Few of them are with|out mittens for their hands, formed from the &s;kins of a bear's paws. Tho&s;e who wear any thing on their heads, re&s;embled, in this particu|lar, the people of Nootka, having high trun|cated conical caps, compo&s;ed of &s;traw, and &s;ome|times of wood.</P>
<P>The hair of the men is commonly cropped round the forehead and neck, but the females &s;uffer it to grow long; and the greate&s;t part of them tie a lock of it on the crown, while a few club it behind, after our method. Both the men and women perforate their ears with &s;everal holes about the outer and lower part of the edge, wherein they &s;u&s;pend &s;mall bunches of beads. They al&s;o perforate the <HI>&s;eptum</HI> of the no&s;e, through which they often thru&s;t the quill-feathers of birds, or little bending ornaments, made of a tubulous &s;helly &s;ub&s;tance, &s;trung on a &s;tiff cord,
<PB N="304" REF="030274_0757_0FE5725F69471F98">
of the length of three or four inches, which give them a ridiculous and grote&s;que appearence. But the mo&s;t extraordinary ornamental fa&s;hion, adopt|ed by &s;ome of the natives of both &s;exes, is their having the under-lip cut quite through length|wi&s;e, rather below the &s;welling part. This in|ci&s;ion frequently exceeds two inches in length, and either by its natural retraction while the wound is &s;till fre&s;h, or by the repetition of &s;ome artificial management, a&s;&s;umes the appearance and &s;hape of lips, and becomes &s;ufficiently large to admit the tongue through. This happened to be the ca&s;e, when a per&s;on with his under-lip thus &s;lit was fir&s;t &s;een by one of our &s;ailors, who im|mediately exclaimed, that the man had two mouths; which, indeed it greatly re&s;embles. They fix in this artificial mouth a flat, narrow kind of ornament, made principally out of a &s;olid &s;hell or bone, cut into &s;mall narrow pieces, like teeth, almo&s;t down to the ba&s;e, or thick part, which has, at each end, a projecting bit, that &s;erves to &s;upport it when put into the divided lip; the cut part then appearing out|wards. Some of them only perforate the lower lip into &s;eparate holes; on which occa&s;ion the ornament con&s;i&s;ts of the &s;ame number of di&s;tinct &s;helly &s;tuds, the points of which are thru&s;t through the&s;e holes, and their heads appear within the lip, not unlike another row of teeth under their natural ones.</P>
<P><PB N="305" REF="030274_0758_0FE572610941FAD8">Such are the native ornaments of the&s;e people. But we ob&s;erved among them many beads of Eu|ropean manufacture, chiefly of a pale blue co|lour, which are hung in their ears, or about their caps, or are joined to their lip-ornaments, which have a little hole drilled in each of the points to which they are fa&s;tened, and others to them, till they &s;ometimes even hang as low as the point of the chin. In this la&s;t ca&s;e, however, they cannot remove them with &s;uch facility; for, with re&s;pect to their own lip-ornaments, they can take them out with their tongue at plea&s;ure. They likewi&s;e wear bracelets of beads, made of a &s;helly &s;ub&s;tance, or others of a cylindrical form, com|po&s;ed of a &s;ub&s;tance re&s;embling amber. And they are, in general, &s;o fond of ornaments of &s;ome kind or other, that they fix any thing in their perforated lip; for one of them appeared with two of our iron nails projecting like prongs from it; and another man attempted to put a large bra&s;s button into it.</P>
<P>The men often paint their faces of a black co|lour, and of a bright red, and &s;ometimes of a bluei&s;h or leaden hue; but not in any regular figure. The woman puncture or &s;tain the chin with black, that comes to a point in each of their cheeks; a cu&s;tom &s;imilar to which is in vogue among the Greenland females, as we are inform|ed by Crantz. The bodies of the&s;e people are not painted, which may probably be owing to the
<PB N="306" REF="030274_0759_0FE572630BC67B08">
&s;carcity of materials for that purpo&s;e; all the co|lours which they brought for &s;ale, being in very &s;mall quantities. Upon the whole, we have in no country &s;een &s;avages who take more pains than the&s;e do, to ornament, or rather (as we &s;hould think) to disfigure their per&s;ons.</P>
<P>Their canoes are of two &s;orts; the one large and open, the other &s;mall and covered. We have mentioned before, that there were twenty women, and one man, be&s;ides children, in one of their large boats. Captain Cook having attentively examined this, and compared its con&s;truction with Crantz's de&s;cription of the great, or woman's boat in Greenland, found that they were built in the &s;ame mode, with no other difference than in the form of the head and &s;tern, particularly of the former, which &s;omewhat re&s;embles a whale's head. The framing con&s;i&s;ts of &s;lender pieces of wood: and the out&s;ide is compo&s;ed of the &s;kins of &s;eals, or other &s;ea animals, &s;tretched over the wood. The &s;mall canoes of the&s;e people, are con&s;tructed nearly of the &s;ame form and mateirals with tho&s;e of the E&s;quimaux and Greenlanders. Some of the&s;e, as we have already mentioned, carry two per&s;ons. Their fore-part is curved like the head of a violin; and they are broader in proportion to their length than tho&s;e of E&s;quimaux.</P>
<P>Their weapons, and implements for hunting and fi&s;hing, are the &s;ame with tho&s;e u&s;ed by the Greenlanders and E&s;quimaux. Many of their
<PB N="307" REF="030274_0760_0FE5726876B13C68">
&s;pears are headed with iron, and their arrows are generally pointed with bone. Their larger darts are thrown by means of a piece of wood about a foot long, with a &s;mall groove in the middle, which receives the dart: at the bottom is a hole for the reception of one finger, which enables them to gra&s;p the piece of wood much firmer, and to throw with greater force. For defen&s;ive armour they have a &s;ort of jacked, or coat of mail, formed of laths, fa&s;tened together with &s;inews, which render it very flexible, though it is &s;o clo&s;e as not to admit a dart or arrow. It &s;erves only to cover the trunk of the body, and may, not improperly, be compared to the &s;tays worn by women.</P>
<P>We had not an oportunity of &s;eeing any of the habitations of the natives, as none of them dwelt in the bay where our &s;hips anchored, or where any of us landed. With re&s;pect to their dome&s;tic uten&s;ils, they brought, in their canoes &s;ome round and oval wooden di&s;hes, rather &s;hal|low; and others of a &s;ylindrical form, con&s;ider|ably deeper. The &s;ides con&s;i&s;ted of one piece, bent round, after the manner of our chip boxes, but thick, and neatly fa&s;tened with thongs; the bottoms being fixed in with &s;mall pegs of wood. Others were &s;omewhat &s;maller, and of a more elegant figure, not unlike a large oval butter-boat, without any handle, but &s;hallower: the&s;e were compo&s;ed of a piece of wood, or &s;ome horny
<PB N="308" REF="030274_0761_0FE5726A8159FE38">
&s;ub&s;tance, and were &s;ometimes neatly carved. They had a number of little &s;quare bags, made of the &s;ame gut with their exterior frocks, curi|ou&s;ly adorned with very &s;mall red feathers, inter|woven with it, in which were contained &s;everal very fine &s;inews, and bundles of &s;mall cord, made out of them, plaited with extraordinary ingenuity. They likewi&s;e brought &s;ome wooden models of their canoes chequered ba&s;kets, wrought &s;o clo&s;ely as to hold water, and a con&s;iderable number of &s;mall images, of the length of four or five inches, either of wood, or &s;tuffed, which were covered with a piece of fur, and embelli&s;hed with quill-feathers, with hair fixed on their heads. We could not determine whether the&s;e were in|tended merely as children's toys, or were held in veneration, as repre&s;enting their decea&s;ed friends and relations, and applied to &s;ome &s;uper&s;titious purpo&s;e. They have many in&s;truments formed of two or three hoops, or concentrical pieces of wood, having a cro&s;s-bar fixed in he middle, by which they are held. To the&s;e they fix a number of dried barnacle-&s;hells, with threads, which when &s;haken, produce a loud noi&s;e, and thus &s;erve the purpo&s;e of a rattle. This contrivance is probably a &s;ub&s;titute for the rattling-bird at King George's Sound.</P>
<P>It is uncertain with what tools their wooden uten&s;ils, frames, of canoes, &amp;c, are made; the only one that we ob&s;erved among them being a &s;ort of
<PB N="309" REF="030274_0762_0FE5726C78AF65F8">
&s;tone adze, &s;omewhat re&s;embling tho&s;e of Ota|heite, and other i&s;lands of the Pacific Ocean. They have a great quantity of iron knives, &s;ome of which are rather curved, others &s;trait, and &s;ome very &s;mall ones, fixed in longi&s;h handles, with the blades bent upwards. They have al&s;o knives of another &s;ort, &s;ometimes almo&s;t two feet in length, &s;haped, in a great mea&s;ure, like a dagger, with a ridge towards the middle. They wear the&s;e in &s;heaths of &s;kins, hung by a thong round their necks, under their robe or frock. It is probable, that they u&s;e them only as weapons, and that their other knives are applied to different purpo&s;es. Whatever they have, is as well made as if they were provided with a complete che&s;t of tools; and their plating of &s;inews, &s;ewing, and &s;mall work on their little bags above mentioned, may be &s;aid to vie with the neate&s;t manufactures found in any part of the globe. Upon the whole, con&s;idering the uncivilized &s;tate of the natives of this Sound, their northerly &s;ituation, amid&s;t a country almo&s;t continually covered with &s;now, and the comparatively wretched materials they have to work with, it appears, that, with re&s;pect to their &s;kill and invention, in all manual operations, they are at lea&s;t equal to any other people.</P>
<P>The food that we &s;aw them eat, was the fle&s;h of &s;ome animal, either roa&s;ted or broiled, and dried fi&s;h. Some of the former that was pur|cha&s;ed,
<PB N="310" REF="030274_0763_0FE5726E54B11A98">
had the appearance of bear's fle&s;h. They likewi&s;e eat a larger &s;ort of fern-root, either baked or dre&s;&s;ed in &s;ome other method. Some of us ob&s;erved them eat freely of a &s;ub&s;tance, which we imagined was the interior part of the pine bark. Their drink, in all probability, is water; for, in their canoes, they brought &s;now in wooden ve&s;|&s;els, which they &s;wallowed by mouthfulls. Their manner of eating is decent and cleanly, for they con&s;tantly took care to remove any dirt that might adhere to their food; and though they would &s;ometimes eat the raw fat of &s;ome &s;ea animal, they did not fail to cut it carefully into mouth|fuls. Their per&s;ons were, to appearance, always clean; and their uten&s;ils, in general, were kept in excellent order, as were al&s;o their boats.</P>
<P>The language of the&s;e people &s;eems difficult to be under&s;tood; which is, perhaps, not owing to any confu&s;ion or indi&s;tinctne&s;s in their &s;ounds, but to the various &s;ignifications which their words bear. For they appeared frequently to make u&s;e of the &s;ame word on very different oc|ca&s;ions; though, probably, if we had had a longer intercour&s;e with them, this might have proved to be a mi&s;take on our part. Among the very few words of their language that Mr. Ander&s;on was enabled to procure, are the following, viz. <HI>aa,</HI> yes; <HI>keeta,</HI> give me &s;omething; <HI>tawuk,</HI> keep it; <HI>aka&s;hou,</HI> what's the name of that? <HI>namuk,</HI> an ear-ornament; <HI>natoone&s;huk,</HI> a &s;ea-otter's &s;kin;
<PB N="311" REF="030274_0764_0FE5727325102CA8">
<HI>ableu,</HI> a &s;pear; <HI>yaut,</HI> I'll go, or, &s;hall I go? <HI>keela&s;hnk,</HI> guts of which they make jackets; <HI>naema,</HI> give me &s;omething by way of exchange, or bar|ter; <HI>whaehai,</HI> &s;hall I keep it? <HI>ooonaka,</HI> of or be|longing to me.</P>
<P>Our knowledge of the animals of this part of the American continent, is entirely derived from the &s;kins that were brought by the natives for &s;ale. The&s;e were principally of bears, common and pine martins, &s;ea-otters, &s;eals, racoons, &s;mall ermines, foxes, and the whiti&s;h cat or lynx. Among the&s;e various &s;kins, the mo&s;t common were tho&s;e of racoons, martins, and &s;ea-otters, which con&s;tituted the ordinary dre&s;s of the&s;e peo|ple; but the &s;kins of the martins, which were in general of a far lighter brown than tho&s;e of Nootka, were greatly &s;uperior to them in point of finene&s;s; whereas tho&s;e of the &s;ea-otters, which, as well as the martins, were much more plentiful here than at Nootka, &s;eemed to be con&s;iderably inferior in the thickne&s;s and finene&s;s of their fur, though they far exceeded them with re&s;pect to &s;ize; and were, for the mo&s;t part, of the glo&s;&s;y black &s;ort. The &s;kins of &s;eals and bears were al&s;o pretty common; and the former were in general white, beautifully &s;potted with black, or &s;ome|times &s;imply white; and many of the bears here were of a dark brown hue.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e animals, there is here the white bear, of who&s;e &s;kins the natives brought &s;everal
<PB N="312" REF="030274_0765_0FE57275471CDCA0">
pieces, and &s;ome compleat &s;kins of cubs. There is al&s;o the wolverine, or quickhatch, who&s;e &s;kin has very bright colours; and a larger &s;pecies of ermine than the common one, varied with brown, and having &s;carcely any black on its tail. The &s;kin of the head of &s;ome very large animal was likewi&s;e brought to us, but we could not po&s;i|tively decide what it was: though, from the co|lour and &s;haggine&s;s of the hair, and its not re|&s;embling any land animal, we conjectured that it might be that of the male ur&s;ine &s;eal, or &s;ea-bear. But one of the mo&s;t beautiful &s;kins that fell under our ob&s;ervation, is that of a &s;mall ani|mal near a foot in length, of a brown colour on the back with a number of ob&s;cure whiti&s;h &s;pecks, the &s;ides being of a bluei&s;h a&s;h colour, with a few of the&s;e &s;pecks. The tail is about a third part of the length of the body, and is covered with whiti&s;h hair. This animal is doubtle&s;s the &s;ame with that which is called by Mr. Staehlin, in his account of the New Northern Archipelago, the &s;potted field mou&s;e. But whether it is really of the mou&s;e kind, or a &s;quirrel, we could not determine, for want of intire &s;kins; though Mr. Ander&s;on was inclined to imagine, that it is the &s;ame animal which Mr. Pennant has de&s;cribed under the appellation of the Ca&s;an marmot. The great number of &s;kins that we ob&s;erved here, demon&s;trates the abundance of the various ani|mals we have mentioned; but it is &s;omewhat re|markable,
<PB N="313" REF="030274_0766_0FE57276CF295518">
that we neither met with the &s;kins of the mou&s;e, nor of the common &s;pecies of deer.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to birds, we found here the <HI>hal|cyon,</HI> or great king-fi&s;her, which had fine bright colours; the &s;hag; the white-headed eagle; and the humming-bird, which often flew about our &s;hips, while we lay at anchor; though it can &s;carcely be &s;uppo&s;ed to live here during the win|ter, which mu&s;t be extremely &s;evere. The wa|ter-fowl &s;een by us were Black &s;ea-pyes, with red bills, &s;uch as we met with in New-Zealand and Van Diemen's Land; gee&s;e; a &s;mall &s;ort of duck, nearly re&s;embling that &s;pecies we &s;aw at Ker|guelen's Land; and another &s;ort with which none of us were acquainted. Some of our people who went a&s;hore, killed a &s;nipe, a grou&s;e, and &s;ome plovers. But though the water-fowl were nu|merous, particularly the gee&s;e and ducks, they were &s;o &s;hy that it was &s;carce po&s;&s;ible to get within &s;hot; in con&s;equence of which, we pro|cured a very incon&s;iderable &s;upply of them as re|fre&s;hment. The duck before-mentioned is about the &s;ize of the common wild duck, of a deep black, with red feet, and a &s;hort pointed tail. Its bill is white, tinged towards the point with red, and has a large black &s;pot, almo&s;t &s;quare, near its ba&s;e, on each &s;ide, where it is al&s;o &s;ome|what di&s;tended. On the forehead is a large tri|angular white &s;pot; and on the hind<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r part of the neck is one &s;till larger. The colours of the fe|male
<PB N="314" REF="030274_0767_0FE57278546C35E0">
are con&s;iderably duller than tho&s;e of the male; and it has none of the ornaments of the bill, excepting the two black &s;pots, which are rather ob&s;cure.</P>
<P>A &s;pecies of diver, which &s;eems peculiar to this place, was ob&s;erved here. It is equal to a partridge in &s;ize, and has a &s;hort, black, com|pre&s;&s;ed bill. Its head, and the upper part of its neck, are of a browni&s;h black; and the remainder of its body is of a deep brown, ob&s;curely waved with black, except the under part, which is to|tally of a blacki&s;h ca&s;t, minutely varied with white. We al&s;o found a &s;mall land bird, of the finch kind, about the &s;ize of a yellow-hammer; but we imagined it to be one of tho&s;e which change their colour with the &s;ea&s;on, and with their dif|ferent migrations. It was, at this time, of a du&s;ky brown, with a reddi&s;h tail; and the &s;up|po&s;ed male had, on the crown of the head, a large yellow &s;pot, with &s;ome varied black on the upper part of its neck, but the latter was on the brea&s;t of the female.</P>
<P>The fi&s;h that were principally brought to us by the natives for &s;ale, were tor&s;k and halibut; and we caught &s;ome &s;culpins about the &s;hip, with &s;tar-fi&s;h of a purpli&s;h hue, that had &s;ixteen or eighteen rays. The rocks were almo&s;t de&s;titute of &s;hell-fi&s;h; and the only other animal of this tribe that was ob&s;erved by us, was a reddi&s;h crab, covered with very large &s;pines.</P>
<P><PB N="315" REF="030274_0768_0FE5727C6D430558">The metals &s;een by us were iron and copper; both which, but more particularly the former, were in &s;uch abundance, as to form the points of numbers of their lances and arrows. The ores which they made u&s;e of to paint them&s;elves with, were a brittle, unctuous, red ochre, or iron ore; a pigment of a bright blue; and black lead. Each of the&s;e &s;eemed to be very &s;carce among them.</P>
<P>We ob&s;erved few vegetables of any kind; and the trees that chiefly grew about this &s;ound, were the Canadian and &s;pruce pine, &s;ome of which were of a con&s;iderable &s;ize.</P>
<P>The&s;e people mu&s;t, doubtle&s;s, have received from &s;ome more civilized nation, the beads and iron found among them. We were almo&s;t cer|tain, that we were the fir&s;t Europeans with whom they had ever had a direct communication; and it remains only to be determined, from what quarter they had procured our manufactures, by intermediate conveyance. And it is more than probable, that they had obtained the&s;e articles, through the intervention of the more i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">land tribes either from the &s;ettlements about Hud&s;on's Bay, or tho&s;e on the lakes of Canada; unle&s;s we can admit the &s;uppo&s;ition, that the Ru&s;&s;ians, from Camt&s;ckatka, have already extended their traffic to this di&s;tance; or that the natives of their mo&s;t ea&s;terly Fox I&s;lands carry on an intercour&s;e along the coa&s;t, with the inhabitants of Prince Wililam's Sound.</P>
<P><PB N="316" REF="030274_0769_0FE5727EE1C02300">With re&s;pect to copper, the&s;e people, perhaps, procure it them&s;elves, or, at mo&s;t, it pa&s;&s;es to them through few hands; for, wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> they offered any of it by way of barter, they u&s;ed to expre&s;s its being in &s;ufficient plenty among them, by pointing to their weapons; as if they meant to intimate, that as they had &s;o much copper of their own, there was no occa&s;ion for increa&s;ing their &s;tock.</P>
<P>If, however, the natives of this inlet are fur|ni&s;hed with European commodities by means of the intermediate traffic to the ea&s;tern coa&s;t, it is rather remarkable, that they &s;hould never, in return, have &s;upplied the more inland Indians with &s;ome of their &s;ea-otter &s;kins, which would undoubtedly have appeared, at &s;ome time or other, in the invirons of Hud&s;on's Bay. But that does not appear to be the ca&s;e; and the only method by which we can account for this, mu&s;t be by con&s;idering the very great di&s;tance; which, though it might not prevent European articles of commerce from coming &s;o far, as being &s;o un|common, might hinder the &s;kins, which are com|mon, from pa&s;&s;ing through more than two or three tribes, who might make u&s;e of them for their own clothing, and &s;end others, which they reckoned of inferior value, as being of their own animals, towards the ea&s;t, till they reach the traders at the European &s;ettlements.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>LEAVING Prince William's Sound, on Wedne&s;dy the 20th of May, we &s;teered to the &s;outh-we&s;t, with a gentle breeze; which was &s;ucceeded by a calm at four o'clock the next morning, and that calm was &s;oon after followed by a breeze from &s;outh-we&s;t. We continued to &s;tretch to the &s;outh-we&s;t, and pa&s;&s;ed a lofty pro|montory, in the latitude of 59&deg; 10&prime;, and the lon|gitude of 207&deg; 45&prime;. It having been di&s;covered on Prince&s;s Elizabeth's birth-day, Captain Cook gave it the name of <HI>Cape Elizbeth.</HI> As we could &s;ee no land beyond it, we flattered our&s;elves that it was the we&s;tern extremity of the continent;
<PB N="318" REF="030274_0771_0FE5728242CDDD70">
but we were &s;oon convinced that we were mi&s;|taken, fre&s;h land appearing in &s;ight, bearing we&s;t-&s;outh-we&s;t. The wind had now increa&s;ed to a &s;trong gale, and forced us to a con&s;iderable di&s;|tance from the coa&s;t. On the 22d, in the after|noon, the gale abated, and we &s;tood for Cape Elizabeth; which, about noon the next day, bore we&s;t, di&s;tant ten leagues. New land was then &s;een, bearing &s;outh-we&s;t, which, it was imagined connected Cape Elizabeth with the land we had &s;een towards the we&s;t.</P>
<P>We &s;tood to the &s;outhward till the next day at noon, at which time we were about three leagues from the coa&s;t, which we had &s;een on the 22d. In this &s;ituation, it formed a point, that bore we&s;t-north-we&s;t. More land was di&s;covered, ex|tending to the &s;outhward; on which was &s;een a ridge of mountains, with &s;ummits covered with &s;now, behind the fir&s;t land, which we &s;uppo&s;ed to be an i&s;land, there appearing on it but an in|con&s;iderable quantity of &s;now. The latitude of this point of land is 58&deg; 15&prime;, and its longitude 207&deg; 42&prime;. And, by what the Commodore could gather from Beering's Voyage and Chart, &s;up|po&s;ed it to be what he called Cape St. Hermo|genes. But the account of that Voyage, as well as the chart, is &s;o extremely inaccurate, that it is almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to di&s;cover any one place, which that navigator either &s;aw or touched at. The Commodore, indeed, was by no means certain,
<PB N="319" REF="030274_0772_0FE57287755F25A0">
that the bay which he had named after Beering, was the place where he had anchored.</P>
<P>In the chart above mentioned, a &s;pace is here pointed out, where Beering is &s;uppo&s;ed to have &s;een no land. This favoured Mr. Staehelin's as|count, who makes Cape St. Hermogenes, and the land di&s;covered by Beering to the &s;outh we&s;t of it, to be a clu&s;ter of i&s;lands; and that St Her|mogenes is one of tho&s;e which are de&s;titute of wood. This appeared to be confirmed by what we now &s;aw; and we entertained the plea&s;ing hopes of finding here a pa&s;&s;age northward, with out being under the nece&s;&s;ity of proceeding any farther to the &s;outh-we&s;t.</P>
<P>By variable light airs and calms, we were de|tained off the Cape till two o'clock in the morn|ing of the 25th, when a breeze &s;pringing up, we &s;teered along the coa&s;t, and perceived that the land of Cape St. Hermogenes was an i&s;land, about &s;ix leagues in circumference &s;eparated from the coa&s;t by a channel of about one league in breadth. Some rocks lie above water, a league and a half to the north of this i&s;land; and on the north-ea&s;t &s;ide of the rocks, we had from thirty to twenty fathoms water.</P>
<P>About noon, St. Hermogenes bore &s;outh-ea&s;t, di&s;tant eight leagues; the land to the north-we&s;t extending from &s;outh half we&s;t to near we&s;t. In the la&s;t direction it ended in a low point, named <HI>Point Banks.</HI> The &s;hip was, at this time, in
<PB N="320" REF="030274_0773_0FE5728ACE9E14A8">
the latitude of 58&deg; 41&prime;, and in the longitude of 207&deg; 44&prime;. In this &s;ituation, the land was in &s;ight bearing north-we&s;t, which, it was imagined, con|nected Cape Elizabeth with this &s;outh-we&s;t land. When we approached it, we &s;aw it was a groupe of high i&s;lands and rocks, and con&s;equently un|connected with any other land. From the naked|ne&s;s of their appearance, they were denominated the <HI>Barren I&s;les:</HI> they are &s;ituated in the latitude of 59&deg;, three leagues di&s;tant from Cape Elizabeth, and five from Point Banks.</P>
<P>We intended to have pa&s;&s;ed through one of the channels by which the&s;e i&s;lands are divided; but, a &s;trong current &s;etting again&s;t us, we went to the leeward of them all. The weather, which had been thick and hazy, cleared up towards the evening, and we perceived a very lofty promon|tory, who&s;e elevated &s;ummit appeared above the clouds, forming two exceedingly high mountains. The Commodore named this promontory <HI>Cape Douglas,</HI> in honour of his friend Dr. Douglas canon of Wind&s;or. Its latitude is 58&deg; 56&prime;, and its longitude 206&deg; 10&prime;; twelve leagues from Point Banks, and ten to the we&s;tward of the Barren I&s;les.</P>
<P>The coa&s;t &s;eemed to form a large deep bay, between this point and Cape Douglas; which, from our ob&s;erving &s;ome &s;moke upon Point Banks received the name of <HI>Smokey Bay.</HI> On the 26th, at day-break, being to the northward of the Bar|ren
<PB N="321" REF="030274_0774_0FE5728C867B60C8">
I&s;les, we perceived more land, extending from Cape Dougla&s;s to the north. It con&s;i&s;ted of a chain of very high mountains; one of which being much more con&s;picious than the re&s;t, ob|tained the name of <HI>Mount St Augu&s;tin.</HI></P>
<P>We were not di&s;couraged at perceiving this land, &s;uppo&s;ing it to be wholly unconnected with the land of Cape Elizabath. We al&s;o expected to find a pa&s;&s;age to the north-we&s;t, betwen Cape Dougla&s;s and Mount St. Augu&s;tin. It was, in|deed, imagined, that the land to the north of Cape Dougla&s;s, con&s;i&s;ted of a groupe of i&s;lands, &s;eperated by &s;o many channels, any of which we might have cho&s;en, according to the direction of the wind.</P>
<P>Flattered with the&s;e ideas, and having a fre&s;h gale at north-north-ea&s;t, we &s;tood to the north-we&s;t, till eight o'clock, when we were fully con|vinced, that what we had &s;uppo&s;ed to be the i&s;lands, were &s;ummits of mountains, connected by the lower land, which we could not perceive at a greater di&s;tance, on account of the hazine&s;s of the horizon. This land was covered wholly with &s;now, from the tops of the mountains down to the &s;ea beach; and had, in every other re&s;pect, the appearance of a great continent. Captain Cook was now fully convinced that he &s;hould di&s;cover no pa&s;&s;age by this inlet: and his per&s;e|vering in the &s;earch of it, was more to &s;atisfy others, than to confirm his own opinion.</P>
<P><PB N="322" REF="030274_0775_0FE5728E0BE011D0">Mount St. Augu&s;tin, at this time, bore north we&s;t, about three leagues di&s;tant. It is of va&s;t height, and of a conical figure; but whether it be an i&s;land, or part of the continent, is not yet a&s;certained. Perceiving that nothing was to be done to the we&s;t, we &s;tood over to Cape Eliza|beth, under which we fetched at about five in the afternoon.</P>
<P>Between Cape Elizabeth and a lofty promon|tory, named <HI>Cape Bede</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This name, and that of Mount St. Augu&s;tin, were di|rected by our calendar.</NOTE>, is a bay, in which there appeared to be two &s;nug harbours. We &s;tood into this bay, and might have anchored there in twenty-three fathoms water: but, the Commo|dore having no &s;uch intention, we tacked, and &s;tood to the we&s;tward, with a very &s;trong gale, accompanied with rain and hazy weather. The gale abated the next morning, and about three o'clock in the afternoon, the weather cleared up; Cape Dougla&s;s bearing &s;outh-we&s;t by we&s;t, and the depth of water being forty fathoms, over a rocky bottom.</P>
<P>The coa&s;t from Cape Bede, trended north-ea&s;t by ea&s;t, with a chain of mountains inla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d, in the &s;ame direction. On the coa&s;t, the land was woody, and there appeared to be &s;ome commodious har|bours. We had the mortification, however, to di&s;cover low land in the middle of the inlet, ex|tending
<PB N="323" REF="030274_0776_0FE5729659EE8CC0">
from north-north-ea&s;t, to north-ea&s;t by ea&s;t; but, as it was &s;uppo&s;ed to be an i&s;land, we were not much di&s;couraged. About this time we &s;teered, with a light breeze, to the we&s;tward of this low land; as, in that direction, there was no appearance of ob&s;truction. Our &s;oundings were from thirty to twenty-five fathoms.</P>
<P>In the morning of the 28th, having but little wind, the &s;hip drove to the &s;outhward; and, in order to &s;top her, we dropped a kedge-anchor, with an eight inch hau&s;er. But, in bringing the &s;hip up, we lo&s;t both that and the anchor. We brought the &s;hip up, however, with one of the bowers, and &s;pent a con&s;iderable part of the day in &s;weeping for them, but without effect. We were now in the latitude of 59&deg; 51&prime;; the low-land extended from north ea&s;t to &s;outh-ea&s;t, the neare&s;t part di&s;tant about two leagues. The land on the we&s;tern &s;hore was di&s;tant about &s;even leagues. A &s;trong tide &s;et to the &s;outh-ward, out of the inlet; it was the ebb, and ran almo&s;t four knots in an hour. At ten o'clock it was low water. Great quantities of &s;ea-weed, and &s;ome drift wood, were taken out with the tide. Though the water had become thick, and re&s;embled that in rivers, we were encouraged to proceed, by finding it as &s;alt as the ocean, even at low water. Three knots was the &s;trength of the flood tide; and the &s;tream continued to run up till four in the afternoon.</P>
<P><PB N="324" REF="030274_0777_0FE572996174F100">Having a calm the whole day, we moved with a light breeze at ea&s;t, at eight o'clock in the evening, and &s;tood to the north, up the inlet. The wind, &s;oon after, veered to the north, in|crea&s;ed to a fre&s;h gale, and blew in &s;qualls, with &s;ome rain. But this did not hinder us from ply|ing up while the flood continued, which was till the next morning, at near five o'clock. We had from thirty-five to twenty-four fathoms water. We anchored about two leagues from the ea&s;tern &s;hore, where our latitude was 6o&deg; 8&prime;; &s;ome low land, which we &s;uppo&s;ed to be an i&s;land, lying under the we&s;tern &s;hore, di&s;tant between three and four leagues.</P>
<P>The weather having now become fair and clear, we could &s;ee any land within our horizon; when nothing was vi&s;ible to ob&s;truct our progre&s;s in a north-ea&s;t direction. But a ridge of mountains appeared on each &s;ide, ri&s;ing behind each other, without any &s;eparation. Captain Cook &s;uppo&s;ed it to be low water about ten o'clock, but the ebb ran down till almo&s;t twelve. Two columns of &s;moke were now vi&s;ible on the ea&s;tern &s;hore; a certain &s;ign that inhabitants were near. We weighed at one in the afternoon, and plied up under double reefed top&s;ails, having a &s;trong gale at north ea&s;t.</P>
<P>We &s;tretched over to the we&s;tern &s;hore, intend|ing to have taken &s;helter till th gale &s;hould cea&s;e; but falling &s;uddenly from forty fathoms water
<PB N="325" REF="030274_0778_0FE5729C10189330">
into twelve, and &s;eeing the apperance of a &s;hoal, we &s;tretched back to the ea&s;tward, and anchored in nineteen fathoms water, under the ea&s;tern &s;hore; the north-we&s;t part of which, ended in a bluff point.</P>
<P>On the 30th of May, about two o'clock in the morning, we weighed anchor again, the gale hav|ing much abated, but &s;till continuing contrary. We plied up till near &s;even, and then anchored in nineteen fathoms water, under the &s;hore to the ea&s;tward.</P>
<P>Two canoes, with a man in each, came off to the &s;hip about noon, nearly from that part where we had &s;een the &s;moke the day before. It co&s;t them &s;ome labour to paddle acro&s;s the &s;trong tide; and they he&s;itated a little, before they dared ven|ture to approach us. One of them was very lo|quacious, but to no purpo&s;e, for we could not under&s;tand a &s;yllable he &s;aid: while he was talk|ing, he kept pointing continually to the &s;hore, which we &s;uppo&s;ed to be an invitation for us to go thither. Captain Cook made them a pre&s;ent of a few trifles, which he conveyed to them from the quarter gallery.</P>
<P>The&s;e people &s;trongly re&s;embled tho&s;e we had &s;een in Prince William's Sound, both in dre&s;s and per&s;on: their canoes were al&s;o con&s;tructed in the &s;ame manner. One of our vi&s;itors &s;eemed to have no beard, and his face was painted of a jet black; the other, who was older, was not paint|ed,
<PB N="326" REF="030274_0779_0FE5729DE5139B90">
but he had a large beard, and a countenance like the common &s;ort of the people in the Sound. Smoke was this day &s;een upon the flat we&s;tern &s;hore; whence we inferred, that the&s;e lower &s;pots only are inhabited.</P>
<P>As we weighed when the flood made, the canoes quitted us. We &s;tood over to the we&s;tern &s;hore, with a fre&s;h gale, and fetched under the point above mentioned. This, with the point on the oppo&s;ite &s;hore, contracted the breadth of the channel to about four leagues, through which ran a prodigious tide. It had a terrible appearance, as we were ignorant whether the water was thus agitated by the &s;tream, or by the da&s;hing of the waves again&s;t &s;ands or rocks. Meeting with no &s;hoal, we concluded it to be the former, but we afterwards found our&s;elves mi&s;taken.</P>
<P>We kept the we&s;tern &s;hore aboard, that appear|ing to be the faire&s;t. We had a depth of thirteen fathoms near the &s;hore, and, two or three miles off, upwards of forty. In the evening, about eight o'clock, we anchored under a point of land bearing north-ea&s;t, di&s;tant about three leagues, and lay there during the ebb.</P>
<P>Till we arrived here, the water retained an equal degree of &s;altne&s;s, both at high and low water, and was as &s;alt as that which is in the ocean; but now the marks of a river evidently di&s;played them&s;elves. The water, which was taken up at this ebb, was much fre&s;her than any
<PB N="327" REF="030274_0780_0FE572A629ABE860">
we had ta&s;ted; whence we concluded that we were in a large river, and not in a &s;trait which had a communication with the northern &s;eas. But having proceeded thus far, we were anxious to have &s;tronger proofs; and, therefore, in the morning of the 31&s;t we weighed with the flood, and drove up with the tide, having but little wind.</P>
<P>We were attended, about eight o'clock, by many of the the natives, in one large canoe, and &s;everal &s;mall ones. The latter had only one per|&s;on on board each; and &s;ome of the paddles had a blade at each end, like tho&s;e of the E&s;quimaux. Men, women, and children, were contained in the large canoes. At &s;ome di&s;tance from the &s;hip, they exhibited on a long pole, a kind of leathern frock, which we interpreted to be a &s;ign of their peaceable intentions. They conveyed this frock into the &s;hip, as an acknowledgement for &s;ome trifles which the Commodore had given them.</P>
<P>No difference appeared either in the per&s;ons, dre&s;s, or canoes of the&s;e people, and the natives of Prince William's Sound, except that the &s;mall canoes were not &s;o large as tho&s;e of the Sound, and carried only one man.</P>
<P>We bartered with them for &s;ome of their fur dre&s;&s;es, made of the &s;kins of animals; particular|ly tho&s;e of &s;ea-otters, martins, and hares: we al&s;o had a few of their dar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s, and a &s;upply of &s;almon
<PB N="328" REF="030274_0781_0FE572A7FA95D168">
and halibut. We gave them in exchange for the&s;e, &s;ome old cloths, beads, and pieces of iron.</P>
<P>They were already po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of large iron knives, and gla&s;s beads of a &s;ky blue colour, &s;uch as we &s;aw among the inhabitants of Prince Wil|liam's Sound. The latter, as well as tho&s;e which they received of us, they &s;eemed to value highly. But they were particularly earne&s;t in a&s;king for large pieces of iron, to which they gave the name of <HI>goone;</HI> though with them, as well as with their neighbours in the Sound, one word &s;eemed to have many &s;ignifications. Their language is certainly the &s;ame, the words <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">naka, keeta,</HI> and <HI>naema,</HI> and a few others which were frequently u&s;ed in Prince William's Sound, were al&s;o com|monly u&s;ed by this new tribe. After pa&s;&s;ing about two hours between the two &s;hips, they retired to the we&s;tern &s;hore.</P>
<P>We anchored at nine o'clock, in &s;ixteen fa|thoms water, and almo&s;t two leagues from the we&s;tern &s;hore, the ebb being already begun. It ran but three knots an hour at its greate&s;t &s;trength; and fell, after we had anchored, twenty-one feet upon a perpendicular. The weather was alter|nately clear and mi&s;ty, with drizling rain. When it was clear, we perceived low land between the mountains on the ea&s;tern &s;hore, bearing ea&s;t from the &s;tation of the &s;hips, which we concluded to be i&s;lands between us and the main land. We
<PB N="329" REF="030274_0782_0FE548C2D0736D00">
al&s;o beheld low land to the northward, which appeared to extend from the mountains on one &s;ide, to tho&s;e on the other; and, at low water, large &s;hoals were &s;een, &s;tretching out from this low land, from &s;ome of which we were not far di&s;tant. We doubted, from the&s;e appearances, whether the inlet did not take an ea&s;terly direction through the above opening; or whether that opening was only a branch of it, the main chan|nel continuing its northern direction. The chain of mountains, on each &s;ide of it, &s;trongly counte|nanced the latter &s;uppo&s;ition.</P>
<P>To be &s;atisfied of the&s;e particulars, Captain Cook di&s;patched two boats; and, when the flood|tide made, followed with the two &s;hips: but it being a dead calm, and having a &s;trong tide, we anchored, after driving about ten miles. At the lowe&s;t of the ebb, the water at and near the &s;ur|face was perfectly fre&s;h; though retaining a con|&s;iderable degree of &s;altne&s;s, if taken above a foot below it&punc; We had this and many other con|vincing proofs of its being a river: &s;uch as thick muddy water, low &s;hores, trees and rubbi&s;h of various kinds, floating backwards and forwards with the tide. In the afternoon we received ano|ther vi&s;it from the natives, in &s;everal canoes, who trafficked con&s;iderably with our people, without &s;o much as attempting any di&s;hone&s;t action.</P>
<P>At two o'clock in the morning of the fir&s;t of June, the ma&s;ter, who commanded the two boats
<PB N="330" REF="030274_0783_0FE572A98472E2B0">
returned, informing us that he found the inlet, or river, contracted to one league in breadth, and that it took a northerly cour&s;e through low land on each &s;ide. He advanced about three leagues through this narrow part, which he found from twenty to &s;eventeen fathoms deep. While the &s;tream ran down, the water was perfectly fre&s;h; but it became bracki&s;h when it ran up, and very much &s;o towards high water.</P>
<P>He went a&s;hore upon an i&s;land, between this branch and that to the ea&s;t, and &s;aw &s;ome cur|rant bu&s;hes; and &s;ome other fruit trees and bu&s;hes that were unknown to him. About three leagues to the northward of this &s;earch, he &s;aw another &s;eparation in the ea&s;tern chain of moun|tains, through which he &s;uppo&s;ed it probable the river took a north-ea&s;t direction; but this, per|haps, was only another branch, and the main channel continued in a northern direction be|tween the two chains of mountains.</P>
<P>The hopes of finding a pa&s;&s;age were no longer entertained; but as the ebb was &s;pent, and we were unable to return again&s;t the tide, we took the advantage of the latter, to get a clo&s;er view of the ea&s;tern branch; in order to determine whether the low land on the ea&s;t, was an i&s;land or not. For this purpo&s;e we weighed with the fir&s;t of the flood, and &s;tood over for the ea&s;tern &s;hore. At eight o'clock a breeze &s;prung up in an oppo&s;ite direction to our cour&s;e, &s;o that we de|&s;paired
<PB N="331" REF="030274_0784_0FE572AB0BB80000">
of reaching the entrance of the river. The Commodore, therefore, di&s;pached two boats. under the command of Lieutenant King, to make &s;uch ob&s;ervations as might enable us to form &s;ome tolerable idea of the nature of the river.</P>
<P>We anchored, about ten o'clock, in nine fa|thoms water. The Commodore ob&s;erving the &s;trength of the tide to be &s;o great, that the boats could not make head again&s;t it, made a &s;ignal for them to return before they had proceeded half way to the entrance of the river. The chief knowledge obtained by this tide's work, was, that all the low land, which we imagined to be an i&s;land, was one continued tract from the great river to the foot of the mountains, terminating at the &s;outh entrance of this ea&s;tern branch, which the Commodore denominated the <HI>river Turn|again.</HI> The low land begins again on the north &s;ide of this river and extends from the foot of the mountains, to the banks of the great river; forming, before the river Turnagain, a large bay, having from twelve to five fathoms water.</P>
<P>After entering the bay, the flood &s;et very &s;trong into the river Turnagain, and the ebb came out &s;till &s;tronger, the water falling twenty feet upon a perpendicular. From the&s;e circum&s;tances, it plainly appeared, that a pa&s;&s;age was not to be expected by this &s;ide river, any more than by the main branch. But, as the water at ebb, though much fre&s;her, retained a con&s;iderable degree of
<PB N="332" REF="030274_0785_0FE572B2350CA0A0">
&s;altne&s;s, it is probable that both the&s;e branches are navigable by &s;hips much farther; and that a very exten&s;ive inland communication lies open, by means of this river and its &s;everal branches. We had traced it to the latitude of 61&deg; 30&prime;, and the longitude of 219&deg;, which is upwards of &s;everal leagues from its entrance end &s;aw no appearance of its &s;ource.</P>
<P>The time we &s;pent in the di&s;covery of this great river <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Captain Cook having here left a blank, Lord Sand|wich very judiciou&s;ly directed it to be called <HI>Cook's River.</HI></NOTE> ought not to be regretted, if it &s;hould hereafter prove u&s;eful to the pre&s;ent, or any future age. But the delay, thus occa&s;ioned, was an e&s;&s;ential lo&s;s to us, who had an object of greater magnitude in view. The &s;ea&s;on was far advanced; and it was now evident that the con|tinent of North America extended much farther to the we&s;t, than we had rea&s;on to expect from the mo&s;t approved charts. The Commodore, how|ever, had the &s;atisfaction to reflect, that, if he had not examined this very large river, &s;pecula|tive fabricators of geography would have ventur|ed to a&s;&s;ert that it had a communication with the &s;ea to the north, or with Hud&s;on's or Baffin's bay to the ea&s;t; and it would probably have been marked, on future maps of the world with as much appearance of preci&s;ion, as the imaginary &s;traits of de Fuca, and de Fonte.</P>
<P><PB N="333" REF="030274_0786_0FE572B3BA866FE8">Mr. King was again &s;ent, in the afternoon, with two armed boats, with orders from Captain Cook to land on the &s;outh ea&s;t &s;ide of the river, where he was to di&s;play the flag; and, in his Maje&s;ty's name, to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the country and the river. He was al&s;o ordered to bury a bottle in the earth, containing &s;ome Engli&s;h coin of 1772, and a paper, whereon were written the names of our &s;hips, and the date of our di&s;covery. The &s;hips, in the mean time, were got under &s;ail. The wind blew fre&s;h ea&s;terly; but we had not been long under way before a calm en&s;ued; and the flood tide meeting us, we found it nece&s;&s;ary to anchor in &s;ix fathoms water; the point where Mr. King landed bearing &s;outh, at the di&s;tance of two miles. This point of land was named <HI>Point Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</HI></P>
<P>On Mr. King's return, he informed the Com|modore, that when he approached the &s;hore, he &s;aw eighteen or twenty of the natives with their arms extended; an attitude, he &s;uppo&s;ed, meant to &s;ignify their peaceable di&s;po&s;ition, and to con|vince him that they were without weapons. See|ing Mr. King and his attendants land, and ob|&s;erving mu&s;quets in their hands, they were a|larmed, and reque&s;ted (by expre&s;&s;ive &s;igns) that they would lay them down. This was im|mediately complied with, and then Mr. King and his party were permitted to walk up to them,
<PB N="334" REF="030274_0787_0FE572B54402F270">
when they appeared to be very &s;ociable and chearful.</P>
<P>They had with them &s;everal dogs, and a few pieces of fre&s;h &s;almon. Mr. Law, Surgeon of the Di&s;covery, happened to be of the party, pur|cha&s;ed one of the dogs, and, taking it towards the boat, immediately &s;hot it dead. At this they &s;eemed exceedingly &s;urprized; and, not thinking them&s;elves &s;afe in &s;uch company, they walked away; but it pre&s;ently appeared, that they had concealed their &s;pears and other weapons in the bu&s;hes clo&s;e behind them. Mr. King in|formed us, that the ground was &s;wampy, and the &s;oil poor and light. It, however, produced &s;ome pines, alders, birch, and willows; &s;ome ro&s;e and current bu&s;hes, and a little gra&s;s; but there was not a plant in flower to be &s;een.</P>
<P>When it was high water we weighed anchor, and, with a faint breeze, &s;tood over to the we&s;t &s;hore, where we anchored early the next morn|ing, on account of the return of the flood. Pre|&s;ently after we were vi&s;ited by &s;everal of the natives, in canoes, who bartered their &s;kins, and afterwards parted with their garments, many of them returning perfectly naked. Among others they brought a great quantity of the &s;kins of white rabbits and red foxes, but only two or three of tho&s;e of otters. We al&s;o purcha&s;ed &s;ome pieces of halibut and &s;almon. They gave iron the preference to every thing we offered them in

exchange. The lip-ornaments were le&s;s in fa&s;hion among them than at Prince William's Sound; but tho&s;e which pa&s;s through the no&s;e were more frequent, and in general, con&s;iderably longer. They had, likewi&s;e, more embroidered work on their garments, quivers, knife-ca&s;es, and many other articles.</P>
<P>We weighed at half pa&s;t ten, and plied down the river with a gentle breeze at &s;outh; when, by the inattention of the man at the lead, the Re|&s;olution &s;truck, and &s;tuck upon a bank, nearly in the middle of the river. It is pretty certain that this bank occa&s;ioned that &s;trong agitation of the &s;tream, with which we were &s;o much &s;ur|prized when turning up the river. We had twelve feet depth of water about the &s;hip, at the lowe&s;t of the ebb, but the bank was dry in other parts.</P>
<P>When the Re&s;olution came aground, Captain Cook made a &s;ignal for the Di&s;covery to anchor. We were afterwards informed, that &s;he had been almo&s;t a &s;hore on the we&s;t &s;ide of the bank. About five o'clock in the afternoon, as the flood tide came in, the &s;hip floated off without &s;u&s;taining any damage, or occa&s;ioning the lea&s;t trouble. We then &s;tood over to the we&s;t &s;hore, where we anchored, in deep water, to wait for the ebb, the wind being &s;till unfavourable to us.</P>
<P>At ten o'clock at night we weighed with the ebb; and about five the next morning, (the 3d
<PB N="336" REF="030274_0789_0FE572BCED729CF0">
of June) the tide being fini&s;hed, we ca&s;t anchor on the we&s;t &s;hore, about two miles below the bluff point. When we were in this &s;tation we were vi&s;ited by many of the natives, who attend|ed us all the morning; and, indeed, their com|pany was highly acceptable to us, as they brought with them a quantity of fine &s;almon, which they exchanged for &s;ome of our trifles. Several hun|dred weight of it was procured for the two &s;hips, and the greate&s;t part of it &s;plit, and ready for drying.</P>
<P>The mountains now, for the fir&s;t time after our entering the river, were free from clouds, and we perceived a volcano in one of tho&s;e on the we&s;tern &s;ide. Its latitude is 60&deg; 23&prime;; and it is the fir&s;t high mountain north of Mount St. Augu&s;tin. The volcano is near the &s;ummit, and on that part of the mountain next the river. It emits a white &s;moke, but no fire. The wind continuing &s;outherly, we &s;till tided it down the river; and, on the morning of the 5th, arriving at the place where we had lo&s;t our kedge an|chor, we attempted, though un&s;ucce&s;sfully, to recover it.</P>
<P>Before our departure from this place, we were again vi&s;ited by &s;ome of the natives, in &s;ix canoes, from the ea&s;tern &s;hore. For half an hour they remained at a &s;mall di&s;tance from the &s;hips, gaz|ing at them with a kind of &s;ilent &s;urprize, without uttering a &s;yllable to us, or to each other. At

length they grew courageous, came along-&s;ide, and began to barter with u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&punc; nor did they leave us till they had parted with their &s;kins and &s;al|mon, which were the only articles they had brought to traffic with.</P>
<P>It may not be unnece&s;&s;ary to remark, that all the people we had &s;een in this river, had a &s;trik|ing re&s;emblance, in every particular, to tho&s;e who inhabit Prince William's Sound, but differ|ed mo&s;t e&s;&s;entially from tho&s;e of Nootka, as well in their per&s;ons as their language.</P>
<P>The points of their &s;pears and knives are made of iron; &s;ome of the former, indeed, are made of copper. Their &s;pears re&s;emble our &s;pontoons; and their knives, for which they have &s;heaths, are of a con&s;iderable length. Except tho&s;e, and a few gla&s;s beads, every thing we &s;aw among&s;t them was of their own manufacture. We have already hazarded conjectures from whence they derive their foreign articles. It cannot be &s;up|po&s;ed, however, that the Ru&s;&s;ians have been among&s;t them, for we &s;hould not then have &s;een them cloathed in &s;uch valuable &s;kins as tho&s;e of the &s;ea-otter.</P>
<P>A very beneficial fur trade might certainly be carried on with the natives of this va&s;t coa&s;t; but, without a northern pa&s;&s;age, it is to re|mote for Great-Britain to be benefited by &s;uch commerce. It &s;hould, however, be ob&s;erved, that almo&s;t the only valuable &s;kins, on, this we&s;t
<PB N="338" REF="030274_0791_0FE572C08C877560">
&s;ide of North America, are tho&s;e of the &s;ea-otter. Their other &s;kins were of a &s;uperior quality; and it &s;hould be farther ob&s;erved, that the greater part of the &s;kins, which we purcha&s;ed of them, were made up into garments. Some of them indeed, were in pretty good condition, others, old and ragged, and all of them extremely lou&s;y. But, as &s;kins are u&s;ed by the&s;e people only for cloathing them&s;elves, they, perhaps, are not at the trouble of dre&s;&s;ing more of them than they require for this purpo&s;e. This is probably the chief cau&s;e of their killing the animals, for they principally receive their &s;upply of food from the &s;ea and rivers. But if they were once habituated to a con&s;tant trade with foreigners, &s;uch an in|tercour&s;e would increa&s;e their wants, by acquaint|ing them with new luxuries; to be enabled to purcha&s;e which, they would become more a&s;&s;idu|ous in procuring &s;kins; a plentiful &s;upply of which might doubtle&s;s be obtained in this coun|try.</P>
<P>The tide is very con&s;iderable in this river, and greatly a&s;&s;i&s;ts to facilitate the navigation of it. In the &s;tream, it is high water between two and three o'clock, on the days of the new and full moon; and the tide ri&s;es between three and four fathoms. The mouth of the river being in a corner of the coa&s;t, the ocean forces the flood into it by both &s;hores, which &s;wells the tide to a greater height than at other parts of this coa&s;t.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE ebb tide making in our favour, we weighed, and, with a gentle breeze at &s;outh-we&s;t, plied down the river. The flood, however, obliged us to anchor again; but, about one o'clock the next morning, we got under &s;ail with a fre&s;h breeze, pa&s;&s;ed the barren i&s;lands a|bout eight, and at noon Cape St. Hermogenes bore &s;outh-&s;outh-ea&s;t, about eight leagues di&s;tant. We intended to go through the pa&s;&s;age between the i&s;land of that name and the main land; but the wind &s;oon after failed us, and we had baffling airs from the ea&s;tward; we, therefore, abandon|ed
<PB N="340" REF="030274_0793_0FE572C9B6B7DBB8">
the de&s;ign of carrying our &s;hip through that pa&s;&s;age.</P>
<P>We now beheld &s;everal columns of &s;moke on the continent, northward of the pa&s;&s;age; which were probably meant as &s;ignals to attract us thi|ther. The land forms a bay here, a low rocky i&s;land lying off the north-we&s;t point of it. Some other i&s;lands, of a &s;imilar appearance, are &s;catter|ed along the coa&s;t between here and Point Banks.</P>
<P>About eight in the evening, St. Hermogenes extended from &s;outh half ea&s;t to &s;outh-&s;outh-ea&s;t; and the rocks bore &s;outh-ea&s;t, di&s;tant three miles. Here we had forty fathoms water, and catched &s;everal halibut with hooks and lines. We pa&s;&s;ed the rocks, and bore up to the &s;outhward about midnight; and, on the 7th at noon, St. Her|mogenes bore north, at the di&s;tance of four leagues. The &s;outhernmo&s;t point of the main land lay north half we&s;t, five leagues di&s;tant. The latitude of this promontory is 58&deg; 15&prime;, and its longitude 207&deg; 24&prime;. It was named, after the day, <HI>Cape-Whit&s;unday;</HI> and a large bay to the we&s;t; of it, was called <HI>Whit&s;untide Bay.</HI></P>
<P>The wind, which had been at north-ea&s;t, &s;hift|ed to the &s;outhward about two in the afternoon. The weather was gloomy, and the air cold. At midnight we &s;tood in for the land, and at &s;even o'clock in the morning of the 8th, we were within four miles of it, and le&s;s than two miles from &s;ome &s;unken rocks, bearing we&s;t-&s;outh-we&s;t.
<PB N="341" REF="030274_0794_0FE572CBB37078E8">
Here we anchored in thirty-five fathoms water. In &s;tanding in for the coa&s;t, we pa&s;&s;ed the mouth of Whit&s;untide Bay, and perceived land all round the bottom of it; therefore the land mu&s;t either be connected, or the points lock in behind each other; the former conjecture appears to be the mo&s;t probable. There are &s;ome &s;mall i&s;lands to the we&s;t of the bay. To the &s;outhward the &s;ea coa&s;t is low, with projecting rocky points, having &s;mall inlets between them. Upon the coa&s;t there was no wood, and but little &s;now; but the mountains, at &s;ome di&s;tance inland, were entirely covered with &s;now. We were now in the latitude of 57&deg; 52 &frac12;; the land here forming a point, it was named <HI>Cape Greville.</HI> Its latitude is 57&deg; 33&prime;, and its longitude 207&deg; 15&prime;. It is fifteen leagues di&s;tant from St. Hermogenes.</P>
<P>The 9th, 10th, and 11th, we had con&s;tant mi&s;ty weather, with &s;ome rain, and &s;eldom had a &s;ight of the coa&s;t; we had a gentle breeze of wind, and the air was raw and cold. We con|tinued plying up the coa&s;t.</P>
<P>In the evening of the 12th, the fog clearing up, we &s;aw the land about twelve leagues di&s;tant, bearing we&s;t; and we &s;tood in for it early the next morning. At noon we were within three miles of it; an elevated point, which was named <HI>Cape Barnabas,</HI> in the latitude of 57&deg; 13&prime;, bore north-north-ea&s;t, at the di&s;tance of about ten miles. We could not &s;ee the north-ea&s;t extreme
<PB N="342" REF="030274_0795_0FE572CD3A6AA6A0">
for the haze, but the point to the &s;outh-we&s;t had an elevated &s;ummit, which terminated in two round hills&punc; and was therefore called <HI>Two-headed Point.</HI> This part of the coa&s;t is principally com|po&s;ed of high hills, and deep vallies. We could &s;ometimes perceive the tops of other hills beyond tho&s;e which form the coa&s;t, which had a very barren appearance, though not much incumbered with &s;now. Not a tree or bu&s;h was to be found, and the land, in general, had a browni&s;h hue.</P>
<P>We continued to ply, and, at about &s;ix in the evening, being about midway between Cape Bar|nabas and Two-headed Point, two leagues from the &s;hore we had &s;ixty-two fathoms water. Here a low point of land was ob&s;erved, bearing &s;outh 69&deg; we&s;t. On the 14th, at noon, we were in the latitude of 56&deg; 49&prime;. The land &s;een in the preceding evening now appeared like two i&s;lands. We were up with the &s;outhernmo&s;t part of this land the next morning, and perceived it to be an i&s;land, which obtained the name of <HI>Trinity I&s;land.</HI> Its greate&s;t extent, in the direction of ea&s;t and we&s;t, if about &s;ix leagues. It has naked elevated land at each end, and is low towards the middle. Its latitude is 56&deg; 36&prime;, and its longitude 205&prime;. It is di&s;tant about three leagues from the continent, between which rocks and i&s;lands are inter&s;per&s;ed. There &s;eems, neverthele&s;s, to be good pa&s;&s;age, and &s;afe anchorage. We at fir&s;t, imagined that
<PB N="343" REF="030274_0796_0FE572CEC3918F18">
this was Beering's <HI>Foggy I&s;land;</HI> but its &s;ituation is not agreeable to his chart.</P>
<P>In the evening at eight, we were within a league of the &s;mall i&s;lands above mentioned. The we&s;ternmo&s;t point of the continent, now in view, we called <HI>Cape Trinity,</HI> it being a low point facing Trinity I&s;land. in this &s;ituation, we &s;tood over for the i&s;land, meaning to work up between that and the main. In &s;tanding over towards the i&s;land, we met two men in a canoe, paddling from thence to the main: in&s;tead of approaching us, they &s;eemed carefully to avoid it.</P>
<P>The wind now inclining to the &s;outh, we ex|pected it would pre&s;ently be at &s;outh-ea&s;t; know|ing, from experience, that a &s;outh-ea&s;terly wind was here generally accompanied with a thick fog, we were afraid to venture between the i&s;land and the continent, le&s;t we &s;hould not be able, to ac|compli&s;h our pa&s;&s;age before night, or before the foggy weather came on; when we &s;hould be un|der the nece&s;&s;ity of anchoring, and lo&s;e the ad|vantage of a fair wind. Induced by the&s;e rea&s;ons, we &s;tretched out to &s;ea, and pa&s;&s;ed two or three rocky i&s;lets, near the ea&s;t end of Trinity I&s;land. Having weathered the i&s;land, we tacked about four in the afternoon, and &s;teered we&s;t &s;outherly, with a gale at &s;outh-&s;outh-ea&s;t, which veered to the &s;outh-ea&s;t about midnight, and was attended with mi&s;ty rainy weather.</P>
<P><PB N="344" REF="030274_0797_0FE572D37122C028">We expected, from the cour&s;e we &s;teered during the night, to fall in with the continent in the morning; and we &s;hould, doubtle&s;s, have &s;een it if the weather had been clear. No land appear|ing at noon, and the gale and fog increa&s;ing, we &s;teered we&s;t-north-we&s;t, under &s;uch &s;ail as we could haul the wind with; &s;en&s;ible of the danger of running before a &s;trong gale, in the vicinity of an unknown coa&s;t, and in a thick fog. It was, however, become nece&s;&s;ary to run &s;ome ri&s;k, when the wind was favourable to us; as we were con|vinced, that clear weather was generally accom|panied with we&s;terly winds.</P>
<P>About three in the afternoon, land was per|ceived through the fog, bearing north-we&s;t, about three miles di&s;tant. We in&s;tantly hauled up &s;outh, clo&s;e to the wind. The two cour&s;es were &s;oon after &s;plit, and we had others to bring to the yards: &s;everal of our &s;ails received con&s;idera|ble damage. The gale abated, and the weather cleared up about nine; when we again &s;aw the coa&s;t, about the di&s;tance of five leagues. Our depth was a hundred fathoms water.</P>
<P>The fog returned &s;oon after, and was di&s;per&s;ed about four o'clock the next morning; when we found our&s;elves, in &s;ome degree, &s;urrounded by land; the continent, or that which we &s;uppo&s;ed to be the continent, &s;ome elevated land, bearing &s;outh-ea&s;t, about nine leagues di&s;tant. The ex|treme of the main, at the north-ea&s;t, was the
<PB N="345" REF="030274_0798_0FE572D5B002DCF0">
point of land &s;een during the fog; it was named <HI>Foggy Cape,</HI> and lies in the latitude of 56&deg; 31&prime;.</P>
<P>Having had but little wind all night, a breeze now &s;prung up at north-we&s;t; we &s;tood to the &s;outhward with this, in order to make the land plainer, that was &s;een in that direction. About nine o'clock, we di&s;covered it to be an i&s;land, nine miles in circumference, in the latitude of 56&deg; 10&prime;, and the longitude of 202&deg; 45&prime;. In our chart, it is named <HI>Foggy I&s;land,</HI> it being rea&s;on|able to &s;uppo&s;e, from its &s;ituation, that it is the i&s;land on which Beering had be&s;towed the &s;ame appellation. Three or four i&s;lands bore north by we&s;t; a point, with pinnacle rocks upon it, bore north-we&s;t by we&s;t, called <HI>Pinnacle Point;</HI> and a clu&s;ter of i&s;lets &s;outh-&s;outh-ea&s;t, about nine leagues from the coa&s;t. In the afternoon we had very little wind, and our progre&s;s was incon&s;ider|able.</P>
<P>On Wedne&s;day the 17th, we had gentle breeze&punc; between we&s;t and north-we&s;t; the weather was perfectly clear, and the air dry and &s;harp. The continent, about noon, extended from &s;outh-we&s;t to north by ea&s;t; the neare&s;t part about &s;even or eight leagues di&s;tant; a group of i&s;lands ly|ing to the &s;outh-we&s;t, about the &s;ame di&s;tance from the continent.</P>
<P>The weather was clear and plea&s;ant on the 18th, and it was calm the greate&s;t part of the day. There is, probably, a continuation of the conti|nent
<PB N="346" REF="030274_0799_0FE572D736073128">
between Foggy Cape and Trinity I&s;land, which the thick weather hindered us from per|ceiving.</P>
<P>The Commodore having occa&s;ion to &s;end a boat to the Di&s;covery, one of the people a-board her, &s;hot a mo&s;t beautiful bird. It is &s;maller than a duck, and the colour is black, except that the fore-part of the head is white; behind each eye, an elegant yellowi&s;h-white cre&s;t ari&s;es; the bill and feet are of reddi&s;h colour. The fir&s;t we &s;aw of the&s;e birds was to the &s;outhward of Cape St. Hermogenes; after which we &s;aw them daily, and frequently in large flocks. We often &s;aw mo&s;t of the other &s;ea-birds, that are u&s;ually met with in the northern ocean; &s;uch as &s;hags, gulls, puffins, &s;heer-waters, ducks, gee&s;e, and &s;wans; and we &s;eldom pa&s;&s;ed a day, without &s;eeing whales, &s;eals, and other fi&s;h of great magnitude.</P>
<P>We got a light breeze, &s;outherly, in the after|noon, and &s;teered we&s;t, for the channel between the i&s;lands and the continent. At day-break next morning, we were not far from it, and per|ceived &s;everal other i&s;lands, within tho&s;e that we had already &s;een, of various dimen&s;ions. But, between the&s;e i&s;lands, and tho&s;e we had &s;een be|fore, there appeared to be a clear channel, for which we &s;teered; and, at noon, our latitude was 55&deg; 18&prime;, in the narrowe&s;t part of the channel. Of this groupe of i&s;lands, the large&s;t was now upon our left, and is called <HI>Kodiak,</HI> as we were
<PB N="347" REF="030274_0800_0FE572D8BB6ED800">
afterwards informed. The Commodore did not be&s;tow a name upon any of the others, though he &s;uppo&s;ed them to be the &s;ame that Beering has named Schumagin's I&s;lands<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Decouve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tes des Ru&s;&s;es, par Muller, p. 262.277.</NOTE>. I&s;lands appeared to the &s;outhward, as far as an i&s;land could be &s;een. They begin in the longitude of 200&deg; 15&prime; ea&s;t, and extend about two degrees to the we&s;tward.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t of the&s;e i&s;lands are tolerably high, but very barren and rugged; exhibiting very roman|tic appearances, and abounding with rocks and cliffs. They have &s;everal bays and coves about them, and &s;ome fre&s;h-water &s;treams de&s;cend from their elevated parts, but the land was not embel|li&s;hed with a &s;ingle tree or bu&s;h. Plenty of &s;now &s;till remained on many of them, as well as on tho&s;e parts of the continent which appeared be|tween the innermo&s;t i&s;lands.</P>
<P>By four o'clock in the afternoon, we had pa&s;&s;ed all the i&s;lands to the &s;outh of us. We found thirty fathoms water in the channel, and &s;oon after we had got through it, the Di&s;covery, which was two miles a&s;tern, fired three guns, and brought too, making a &s;ignal to &s;peak with us. Captain Cook was much alarmed at this; for, as no ap|parent danger had been ob&s;erved in the channel, he was apprehen&s;ive that the Di&s;covery had &s;prung a leak, or met with &s;ome &s;imilar accident. A boat was &s;ent to her, which immediately re|turned
<PB N="348" REF="030274_0801_0FE548C0337AB600">
with Captain Clerke. He informed the Commodore, that &s;ome natives in three or four canoes, having followed the &s;hip for &s;ome time, at la&s;t got under his &s;tern; one of whom made many &s;igns, having his cap off and bowing in the European manner. A rope was then handed down from the &s;hip, to which he fa&s;tened a thin wooden box, and, after he had made &s;ome more ge&s;ticulations, the canoes left the Di&s;covery.</P>
<P>It was not imagined, that the box contained any thing, till the canoes had departed, when it was accidently opened, and found to contain a piece of paper carefully folded up, on which &s;ome wrighting appeared, which they &s;uppo&s;ed to be in the Ru&s;&s;ian language. To this paper was pre|fixed the date 1778, and a reference was made therein to the year 1779. Though unable to de|cypher the alphabet of the writer, we were con|vinced, by his numerals, that others had pre|ceded us in vi&s;iting the&s;e dreary regions. Indeed the hopes of &s;peedily meeting &s;ome of the Ru&s;&s;ian traders, mu&s;t be highly &s;atisfactory to tho&s;e, who had been &s;o long conver&s;ant with the &s;avages of the Pacific Ocean, and tho&s;e of the continent of North America.</P>
<P>At fir&s;t, Captain Clerke imagined, that &s;ome Ru&s;&s;ians had been &s;hipwrecked here; and that, &s;eeing our &s;hips, the&s;e unfortunate per&s;ons were induced thus to inform us of their &s;ituation. Deeply impre&s;&s;ed with &s;entiments of humanity on
<PB N="349" REF="030274_0802_0FE572E0A5995208">
this occa&s;ion, he was in hopes the Re&s;olution would have &s;topped till they had time to join us; hut no &s;uch idea ever occured to Captain Cook. If this had really been the ca&s;e, he &s;uppo&s;ed, that the fir&s;t &s;tep which &s;uch &s;hipwrecked per&s;ons would have taken, in order to &s;ecure relief, would have been, to &s;end &s;ome of their people off to the &s;hips in the canoes. He, therefore, rather thought the paper was intended to communicate &s;ome in|formation, from &s;ome Ru&s;&s;ian trader, who had lately vi&s;ited the&s;e i&s;lands, to be delivered to any of his countrymen who &s;hould arrive; and that the natives &s;uppo&s;ing us to be Ru&s;&s;ians, had brought off the note. Convinced of this, he en|quired no farther into the matter, but made &s;ail, and &s;teered to the we&s;tward.</P>
<P>We ran all night with a gentle breeze at north-ea&s;t; and the next morning at two &s;ome breakers were &s;een within us, di&s;tant about two miles; others were &s;oon after &s;een a-head, and they were innumerable on our larboard bow, and al&s;o be|tween us and the land. By holding a &s;outh cour&s;e we, with difficulty, cleared them. The&s;e breakers were produced by rocks, many of which were above water; they are very dangerous, and ex|tend &s;even leagues from land. We got on their out &s;ide about noon, when our latitude was 54&deg; 44&prime;, and our longitude 198&prime;. The neare&s;t land was an elevated bluff point and was named <HI>Rock-Point</HI>; it bore north, about eight leagues di&s;tance;

the we&s;ternmo&s;t part of the main bore north-we&s;t, and a high round hill, called <HI>Halibut Head,</HI> bore &s;outh-we&s;t, di&s;tant about thirteen leagues.</P>
<P>At noon on the 21&s;t, we made but little pro|gre&s;s, having only faint winds and calms. Hali|but Head then bore north 24&deg; we&s;t; and the i&s;land where it is &s;ituated, called <HI>Halibut I&s;land,</HI> extended from north by ea&s;t to north-we&s;t. This i&s;land is &s;even leagues in circumference, and, ex|cept the head, is very low and barren; &s;everal &s;mall i&s;lands are near it, between which and the main, there appears to be a pa&s;&s;age, of the breadth of two or three leagues.</P>
<P>We were kept at &s;uch a di&s;tance from the con|tinent, by the rocks and breakers, that we had a very di&s;tant view of the coa&s;t between Halibut I&s;land and Rock Point. We could, however, perceive the main land covered with &s;now; and particularly &s;ome hills, who&s;e elevated tops towered above the clouds to a mo&s;t &s;tupendous height. A <HI>volcano</HI> was &s;een on the mo&s;t &s;outh-we&s;terly of the&s;e hills, which perpetually threw up immen&s;e columns of black &s;moke; it is at no great di&s;tance from the coa&s;t, and is in the lati|tude of 54&deg; 48&prime;, and the longitude of 195&deg; 45&prime;. Its figure is a compleat cone, and the volcano is at the &s;ummit of it: remarkable as it may appear, the wind, at the height to which the &s;moke of the volcano ro&s;e, often moved in an oppo&s;ite di|rection to what it did at &s;ea, even in a fre&s;h gale.</P>
<P><PB N="351" REF="030274_0804_0FE572E496B2C2B0">Having three hours calm in the afternoon, up|wards of an hundred halibuts were caught by our people, &s;ome of which weighed upwards of an hundred pounds, and none of them le&s;s than twenty. They were highly acceptable to us. We fi&s;hed in thirty-five fathoms water, about four miles di&s;tant from the &s;hore; during which time we were vi&s;ited by a man in a &s;mall canoe, who came from the large i&s;land. When he approached the &s;hip, he uncovered his head and bowed as the other had done the preceding day, when he came off to the Di&s;covery.</P>
<P>That the Ru&s;&s;ians had &s;ome communication with the&s;e people, was evident, not only from their politene&s;s, but from the written paper al|ready mentioned. We had now an additional proof of it; for our new vi&s;itor had on a pair of green cloth breeches, and a jacket of black cloth, under the frock of his own country. He had with him a grey fox &s;kin, and &s;ome fi&s;hing im|plements; al&s;o a bladder, in which was &s;ome liquid, which we &s;uppo&s;ed to be oil; for he opened it, drank a mouthful, and then clo&s;ed it up again.</P>
<P>His canoe was &s;maller than tho&s;e we had &s;een before, though of the &s;ame con&s;truction; like tho&s;e who had vi&s;ited the Di&s;covery, he u&s;ed the double bladed paddle. His features re&s;embled tho&s;e of the natives of Prince William's Sound, but he was perfectly free from any kind of paint;
<PB N="352" REF="030274_0805_0FE572EA1C549428">
and his lip had been perforated in an oblique di|rection, though at that time, he had not any ornament in it. Many of the words, &s;o frequently u&s;ed by our vi&s;itors in the Sound, were repeated to him, but he did not appear to under&s;tand any of them; owing either to his ignorance of the dialect, or other erroneous pronunciation.</P>
<P>The weather was principally cloudy and hazy, till the afternoon of the 22d, when the wind &s;hifted to the &s;outh-ea&s;t, attended, as u&s;ual, with thick rainy weather. Before the fog, we &s;aw no part of the main land, except the volcano, and a neighbouring mountain. We &s;teered we&s;t till &s;even, when, fearing we might fall in with the land in thick weather, we hauled to the &s;outhward till two the next morning, and then bore away we&s;t. Our progre&s;s was but trifling, having but little wind, and that variable; at five o'clock in the afternoon, we had an interval of &s;un-&s;hine, when we &s;aw land, bearing north 59&deg; we&s;t.</P>
<P>On the 24th, at &s;ix in the morning, we &s;aw the continent, and at nine it extended from north ea&s;t-by-ea&s;t, to &s;outh-we&s;t-by-we&s;t the neare&s;t part four leagues di&s;tant. The land to the &s;outh-we&s;t con&s;i&s;ted of i&s;lands, being what we had &s;een the preceding night. In the evening being about the di&s;tance of four leagues from the &s;hore, and having little wind, we threw out our hooks and lines, but caught only two or three little cod.</P>
<P><PB N="353" REF="030274_0806_0FE572EBE9C2A0C8">We got an ea&s;terly breeze the next morning, and, with it, what was very uncommon, clear weather; in&s;omuch, that we clearly &s;aw the vol|cano, the other mountains, and all the main land under them. It extended from north-ea&s;t by north, to north-we&s;t half we&s;t. Between this point and the i&s;lands, a large opening appeared, for which we &s;teered, till land was &s;een beyond it; and, though we did not perceive that this land joined the continent, a pa&s;&s;age through the opening was very doubtful; as well as whether the land to the &s;outh-we&s;t was in&s;ular or conti|nental. Unwilling to tru&s;t too much to appear|ances, we therefore &s;teered to the &s;outhward; when, having got without all the land in &s;ight, we &s;teered we&s;t, the i&s;lands lying in that direc|tion.</P>
<P>Three of them, all of a good height, we had pa&s;&s;ed by eight o'clock; more were now &s;een to the we&s;tward. In the afternoon, the weather be|came gloomy, and afterwards turned to a mi&s;t, the wind blowing fre&s;h at ea&s;t. We therefore hauled the wind to the &s;outhward till day-break, and then proceeded on our cour&s;e to the we&s;t.</P>
<P>We derived but little advantage from day-light, the weather being &s;o thick that we could not di&s;cover objects at the di&s;tance of a hundred yards; but, as the wind was moderate, we ven|tured to run. About half an hour after four, the &s;ound of breakers alarmed us, on our larboard
<PB N="354" REF="030274_0807_0FE572ED70600498">
bow; we found twenty-eight fathoms water, and then twenty-five. We brought the &s;hip too, and anchored in the la&s;t depth; the Commodore or|dering the Di&s;covery, who was not far di&s;tant, to anchor al&s;o.</P>
<P>Some hours after, the fog being a little di&s;|per&s;ed, we di&s;covered the imminent danger we had e&s;caped. We were three quarters of a mile from the north-ea&s;t &s;ide of an i&s;land; two ele|vated rocks were about half a league from us, and from each other. Several breakers al&s;o ap|peared about them; and yet Providence had &s;afely conducted the &s;hips through in the dark, between tho&s;e rocks, which we &s;hould not have attempted to have done in a clear day, and to &s;o commodious an anchoring place.</P>
<P>Being &s;o near land, Captain Cook ordered a boat a&s;hore, to examine what it produced. When &s;he returned in the afternoon, the officer who commanded her &s;aid, he &s;aw &s;ome gra&s;s, and other &s;mall plants, one of which had the appear|ance of pur&s;lain; but the i&s;land produced neither trees nor &s;hrubs.</P>
<P>The wind blew fre&s;h at &s;outh, in the night, but in the morning was more moderate, and the fog, in a great degree, di&s;per&s;ed. We weighed at &s;even o'clock, and &s;teered between the i&s;land near which we had anchored, and a &s;mall one not far from it. The breadth of the channel does not exceed a mile, and the wind failed before we
<PB N="355" REF="030274_0808_0FE572EF604DDA08">
could pa&s;s through it; we were therefore obliged to anchor, which we did in thirty-four fathoms water. Land now pre&s;ented it&s;elf in every direc|tion. That to the &s;outh extended, in a ridge of mountains, to the &s;outh-we&s;t; which we after|wards found to be an i&s;land called <HI>Oonalo&s;hka.</HI></P>
<P>Between this i&s;land, and the land to the north, which we &s;uppo&s;ed to be a group of i&s;lands, there appeared to be a channel in a north we&s;t direc|tion. On a point, we&s;t from the &s;hip, and at the di&s;tance of three quarters of a mile, we per|ceived &s;everal natives and their habitations. To this place we &s;aw two whales towed in, which we &s;uppo&s;ed had ju&s;t been killed. A few of the in|habitants, occa&s;ionally, came off to the &s;hips, and engaged in a little traffic with our people, but never continued with us above a quarter of an hour at a time. They &s;eemed, indeed, re|markably &s;hy; though we could readily di&s;cover they were not unacquainted with ve&s;&s;els, &s;imilar, in &s;ome degree, to ours. Their manner di&s;play|ed a degree of politene&s;s which we had never ex|perienced among any of the &s;avage tribes.</P>
<P>About one in the afternoon, being favoured with a light breeze, and the tide of flood, we weigh|ed, and proceeded to the channel la&s;t mentioned; expecting, when we had pa&s;&s;ed through, either to find the land trend away to the northward; or that we &s;hould di&s;cover a pa&s;&s;age out to &s;ea, to the we&s;t. For we did not &s;uppo&s;e our&s;elves to
<PB N="356" REF="030274_0809_0FE572F5037CF1C0">
be in an inlet of the continent, but among i&s;lands; and we were right in our conjectures. Soon after we got under &s;ail, the wind veered to the north, and we were obliged to ply. The depth of water was from forty to twenty-&s;even fathoms. In the evening, the ebb made it nece&s;&s;ary for us to an|chor within three leagues of our la&s;t &s;tation.</P>
<P>We weighed the next morning at day break, and were wa&s;ted up the pa&s;&s;age by a light breeze at &s;outh; after which we had variable light airs from all directions. There was, however, a rapid tide in our favour, and the Re&s;olution got through before the ebb made. The Di&s;covery was not equally fortunate, for &s;he was carried back, got into the race, and found a difficulty in getting clear of it.</P>
<P>Being now through the channel, we found the land, on one &s;ide, trending we&s;t and &s;outh-we&s;t, and that on the other &s;ide to north. This en|couraged us to hope, that the continent had taken a new direction in our favour. Being &s;hort of water, and expecting to be driven about in a rapid tide, without wind &s;ufficient to govern the &s;hip, we &s;tood for a harbour the &s;outh &s;ide of the pa&s;&s;age, but were driven beyond it; and, that we might not be forced back through the pa&s;&s;age, anchored near the &s;outhern &s;hore, in twenty-eight fathoms water, and out of the reach of the &s;trong tide; though, even here it ran five knots and an half in an hour.</P>

<P><PB N="357" REF="030274_0811_0FE572F6A9DDF8C8">In this &s;ituation, we were vi&s;ited by &s;everal of the natives in &s;eparate canoes. They bartered &s;ome fi&s;hing implements for tobacco. A young man, among them, over&s;et his canoe, while he was along-&s;ide of one of our boats. He was caught hold of by one of our people, but the canoe was taken up by another and carried a&s;hore. In con&s;equence of this accident, the youth was obliged to come into the &s;hip, where he was in|vited into the cabin, and readily accepted the invitation, without any &s;urprize or embarra&s;&s;|ment. He had on an upper garment, re&s;em|bling a &s;hirt, made of the gut of a whale, or &s;ome other large &s;ea-animal. Under this, he had ano|ther of the &s;ame form, made of the &s;kins of birds with the feathers on, curiou&s;ly &s;ewed together; the feathered &s;ide placed next his &s;kin. It was patched with &s;everal pieces of &s;ilk &s;tuff, and his cap was embelli&s;hed with gla&s;s beads.</P>
<P>His cloaths being wet, we furni&s;hed him with &s;ome of our own, which he put on with as much readine&s;s as we could have done. From the be|haviour of this youth, and that of &s;everal others it evidently appeared, that the&s;e people were no &s;trangers to Europeans, and to many of their cu&s;|toms. Some thing in our &s;hips, however, greatly excited their curio&s;ity; for, &s;uch as had not ca|noes to bring them off, a&s;&s;embled on the neigh|bouring hills <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> have a view of them.</P>
<P><PB N="358" REF="030274_0812_0FE572F832BDF1C8">At low water we towed the &s;hip into the har|bour, where we anchored in nine fathoms water, the Di&s;covery arriving &s;oon after. A boat was &s;ent to draw the &s;eine, but we caught only a few trout, and &s;ome other &s;mall fi&s;h.</P>
<P>We had not long anchored, before a native of the i&s;land brought another note on board, &s;imi|lar to that which had been given to Captain Clerke. He pre&s;ented it to Captain Cook; but, as it was written in the Ru&s;&s;ian language, neither he, nor any of us, could read it. As it could not be of any u&s;e to us, and might probably be of con&s;equence to others, the Commodore re|turned it to the bearer, accompanied with a few pre&s;ents; for which he expre&s;&s;ed his thanks, as he retired, by &s;everal low bows.</P>
<P>On the 29th, we &s;aw along the &s;hore, a group of the natives of both &s;exes &s;eated on the gra&s;s, partaking of a repa&s;t of raw fi&s;h, which they &s;eemed to reli&s;h exceedingly.</P>
<P>We were detained by thick fogs, and a con|trary wind, till the 2d of July; during which time we acquired &s;ome knowledge of the coun|try, as well as of its inhabitants; the particulars of which &s;hall be hereafter related.</P>
<P>This harbour is called <HI>Samganoodha,</HI> by the natives, and is &s;ituated on the north &s;ide of Oonalo&s;hka, the latitude being 53&deg; 55&prime;, the lon|gitude 193&deg; 30&prime;; and in the &s;trait which &s;eparates this i&s;land from tho&s;e to the north. It is about

</ARGUMENT>
<P>ON the 2d of July, we &s;teered from Samga|noodha, with a gentle breeze at &s;outh-&s;outh-ea&s;t, to the northward, and met with nothing to
<PB N="2" REF="030274_0825_0FE573671D9516F0">
ob&s;truct us in that cour&s;e. For on the one &s;ide, the I&s;le of Oonala&s;hka trended &s;outh-we&s;t; and, on the other, no land was vi&s;ible in a direction more northerly than north-ea&s;t; all which land was a continuation of the &s;ame groupe of i&s;lands that we had fallen in with on the 25th of the preceding month. That which is &s;ituated be|fore Samganoodha, and con&s;titutes the north-ea&s;tern &s;ide of the pa&s;&s;age through which we came, is denominated Oonella, and its cir|cumference is about &s;even leagues. Another i&s;land, lying to the north-ea&s;tward of it, bears the name of Acootan, it is con&s;iderably &s;uperior in &s;ize to Oonella, and has in it &s;ome very lofty mountains, which were, at this time, covered with &s;now. It appeared, that we might have pa&s;&s;ed with great &s;afety between the&s;e two i&s;lands and the continent, who&s;e &s;outh-we&s;tern point opened off the north-ea&s;tern point of Acootan and proved to be the &s;ame point of land that we had di&s;cerned when we left the coa&s;t of the con|tinent, the 25th of June, to go without the i&s;lands. It is termed Oonemak by the natives, and is &s;ituate in the longitude of 192&deg; 3&prime; ea&s;t, and in the latitude of 54&deg; 30&prime; north. Over the cape, which, of it&s;elf is high land, there is a round elevated mountain, at pre&s;ent covered with &s;now. This mountain bore ea&s;t 2&deg; north, at &s;ix o'clock in the afternoon; and two hours afterwards, no
<PB N="3" REF="030274_0826_0FE57311B73CB388">
land was to be &s;een. Concluding, therefore, that the coa&s;t of the continent had now inclined to the north-ea&s;tward, we &s;teered the &s;ame cour&s;e, till one o'clock the following morning, when the watch &s;tationed upon deck imagined they &s;aw land a-head. Upon this we wore, and, for the &s;pace of about two hours, &s;tood towards the &s;outh-we&s;t; after which we re&s;umed our cour&s;e to the ea&s;t north-ea&s;t. At &s;ix we di&s;coveted land a-head, at the di&s;tance of about five leagues, bear|ing &s;outh-ea&s;t. As we advanced we de&s;cried more and more land, the whole of which was connected. At twelve o'clock, we ob&s;erved that it extended from &s;outh-&s;outh-we&s;t to ea&s;t, the part neare&s;t to us being five or &s;ix leagues di&s;tant. Our longitude, at this time, was 195&deg; 18&prime; ea&s;t, and our latitude 55&deg; 21&prime; north. At &s;ix, in the afternoon, we &s;ounded, and found a bottom of black &s;and at the depth of forty-eight fathoms. We were now four leagues from the land; and the ea&s;tern part in &s;ight was in the direction of ea&s;t-&s;outh-ea&s;t, appearing as an elevated round hummock.</P>
<P>On Saturday the 4th at eight o'clock in the morning we &s;aw the coa&s;t from &s;outh-&s;outh-we&s;t, and ea&s;t by &s;outh; and, at intervals we could di&s;cern high land, covered with &s;now, behind it. Not long after we had a calm; and being in thirty fathoms water, we caught, with hook and line, a good number of excellent cod. At twelve
<PB N="4" REF="030274_0827_0FE57368A482E898">
we had an ea&s;terly breeze and clear weather; at which time we found our&s;elves about &s;ix leagues from the land which extended from &s;outh by we&s;t to ea&s;t by &s;outh; and the hummock, &s;een the preceding evening, bore &s;outh we&s;t by &s;outh, at the di&s;tance of nine or ten leagues. A great hollow &s;well from the we&s;t-&s;outh-we&s;tward, con|vinced us, that there was no main land, in that direction, near us. We &s;teered a northerly cour&s;e till &s;ix o'clock in the afternoon, when the wind, veering to the &s;outh-ea&s;t, enabled us to &s;teer ea&s;t-north-ea&s;t. The coa&s;t lay in this direction, and, at twelve o'clock on the following day, was at the di&s;tance of about four leagues.</P>
<P>We made but little progre&s;s on the 6th and 7th, as the wind was northerly. In the evening of the latter day, about eight o'clock, the depth of water was nineteen fathoms, and we were three or four leagues from the coa&s;t, which, on Wedne&s;day the 8th, extended from &s;outh-&s;outh-we&s;t to ea&s;t by north, and was all low land, with a ridge of mountains, covered with &s;now, behind it. It is not improbable that this low coa&s;t ex|tends to a con&s;iderable di&s;tance towards the &s;outh-we&s;t; and that tho&s;e places which we &s;ometimes &s;uppo&s;ed to be the inlets or bays, are nothing more than vallies between the mountains. This day we put our hooks and lines over, and caught plenty of fine cod.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="030274_0828_0FE5736A2B135FD0">On the 9th, in the morning, having a breeze at north-we&s;t, we &s;teered ea&s;t by north, in order to make a nearer approach to the coa&s;t. At noon, we were at the di&s;tance of about two leagues from the land, which was ob&s;erved to extend from &s;outh by ea&s;t to ea&s;t-north-ea&s;t; be|ing all a low coa&s;t, with points projecting in &s;everal places, which, from the deck, had the appearance of i&s;lands; but, from the ma&s;t head, we &s;aw that low land connected them. We were now in the longitude of 201&deg; 33&prime; ea&s;t, and in the latitude of 57&deg; 49&prime; north. In this &s;ituation, our &s;oundings were fifteen fathoms, over a bottom of fine black &s;and.</P>
<P>In advancing towards the north-ea&s;t, we had found that the depth of water gradually decrea&s;ed, and the coa&s;t trended more and more northerly. But we ob&s;erved, that the ridge of mountains behind it, continued to lie in the &s;ame direction as tho&s;e that were more we&s;terly; &s;o that the ex|tent of the low land, between the coa&s;t and the foot of the mountains, in&s;en&s;ibly increa&s;ed. Both the low and high grounds were totally de&s;titute of wood; but were apparently covered with a green turf, the mountains excepted, which were involved in &s;now.</P>
<P>As we proceeded along the coa&s;t with a light we&s;terly breeze, the water &s;hoaled gradually from fifteen to ten fathoms, though we were eight or ten miles di&s;tant from the &s;hore. About eight
<PB N="6" REF="030274_0829_0FE5732E754B4B98">
o'clock in the evening, a lofty mountain which had been &s;ome time within &s;ight, bore &s;outh-ea&s;t by ea&s;t, at the di&s;tance of twenty-one leagues. Several other mountains, forming a part of the &s;ame chain, and much further di&s;tant, bore ea&s;t 3&deg; north. The coa&s;t was &s;een to extend as far as north-ea&s;t half north, where it &s;eemed to ter|minate in a point, beyond which it was both our hope and expectation, that it would a&s;&s;ume a more ea&s;terly direction. But, not long after|wards, we perceived low land, that extended from behind this point, as far as north-we&s;t by we&s;t, where it was lo&s;t in the horizon; and be|hind it we di&s;cerned high land, appearing in hills detached from each other. Thus the fine pro|&s;pect we had of getting to the northward vani&s;hed in an in&s;tant. We &s;tood on till nine o'clock, and then the point before-mentioned was about one league di&s;tant, bearing north-ea&s;t half ea&s;t. Behind the point is a river, which at its en|trance, &s;eemed to be a mile in breadth. The water appeared &s;omewhat di&s;coloured, as upon &s;hoals; but a calm would have given it a &s;imilar a&s;pect. It &s;eemed to take a winding direction through the exten&s;ive flat which lies between the chain of mountains towards the &s;outh-ea&s;t, and the hills to the north-we&s;tward. It doubtle&s;s abounds with &s;almon, as many of tho&s;e fi&s;h were &s;een leaping in the &s;ea before the entrance, and &s;ome were found in the maws of cod that we had
<PB N="7" REF="030274_0830_0FE57315A1A58A68">
caught. The mouth of this river, which we di&s;tingui&s;hed by the appellation of Bri&s;tol River, is &s;ituated in the longitude of 201&deg; 55&prime; ea&s;t, and in the latitude of 58&deg; 27&prime; north.</P>
<P>At day-break, on the 10th, we made &s;ail to the we&s;t-&s;outh-we&s;t, with a light breeze at north-ea&s;t. About eleven o'clock, thinking that the coa&s;t towards the north-we&s;t terminated in a point, bearing north-we&s;t by we&s;t, the Commodore &s;teered for that point, having ordered the Di&s;|covery to keep a-head. But, before that ve&s;&s;el had run a mile &s;he made a &s;ignal for &s;hoal water. At that very time we had the depth of &s;even fa|thoms; and before we could get the head of our &s;hip the other way, we had le&s;s than five: but the Di&s;covery's &s;oundings were le&s;s than four fa|thoms. We now &s;tood back to the north-ea&s;t, three or four miles; but ob&s;erving that there was a &s;trong tide &s;etting to the we&s;t-&s;outh-we&s;t, that is, towards the &s;hoal, we brought the &s;hips to anchor in about ten fathoms, over a &s;andy bot|tom. Two hours after we had ca&s;t anchor, the water had fallen upwards of two feet; which proved, that it was the tide of ebb that came from Bri&s;tol River.</P>
<P>In the afternoon, at four o'clock, the wind hav|ing &s;hifted to the &s;outh-we&s;t, we weighed and made &s;ail towards the &s;outh, &s;everal boats being occupied a-head in &s;ounding. Having pa&s;&s;ed over the &s;outh-end of the &s;hoal, in &s;ix fathoms
<PB N="8" REF="030274_0831_0FE5732A95847FC8">
water, we afterwards got into thirteen and fifteen; in which la&s;t depth we let go our anchors again, between eight and nine in the evening; &s;ome part of the chain of mountains on the &s;outh-ea&s;tern &s;hore, being in &s;ight, and bearing &s;outh-ea&s;t half &s;outh; and the mo&s;t we&s;terly land on the other &s;hore bearing north-we&s;t. In the cour&s;e of this day, we had de&s;cried high land, which bore north 60&deg; we&s;t, and which we &s;uppo&s;ed to be about twelve leagues di&s;tant.</P>
<P>We weighed anchor the next morning, at two o'clock, with a gentle breeze at &s;outh we&s;t, by we&s;t, and plied to windward till nine; when judging the flood-tide to be now again&s;t us, we anchor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d in twenty-four fathoms water. At one in the afternoon, the fog, which had this morn|ing prevailed, di&s;per&s;ing, and the tide becoming favourable, we weighed again, and plied to the &s;outh-we&s;tward. Towards the evening, the wind was extremely variable, and we had &s;ome thun|der: we had heard none before, from the time of our arrival on the coa&s;t; and that which we now heard was at a great di&s;tance. The wind &s;ettling again in the &s;outh-we&s;t quarter, in the morning of Sunday the 12th we &s;teered a a north-we&s;t cour&s;e, and, at ten oclock, &s;aw the conti|nent. At mid-day, it extended from north-ea&s;t by north to north-north-we&s;t a quarter we&s;t; and an elevated hill appeared in the direction of north-north-we&s;t, nine or ten leagues di&s;tant. This
<PB N="9" REF="030274_0832_0FE5734153799C68">
was found to be an i&s;land, to which, on account of its figure, Captain Cook gave the name of Round I&s;land. It &s;tands in the latitude of 58&deg; 37&prime; north, and the longitude of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">00&deg; 6&prime; ea&s;t, and is &s;even miles di&s;tant from the continent. At nine in the evening, having &s;teered a northerly cour&s;e to within three leagues of the &s;hore, we tacked in fourteen fathoms water, the extremi|ties of the coa&s;t bearing ea&s;t-&s;outh-ea&s;t half ea&s;t, and we&s;t.</P>
<P>The wind now veered to the north-we&s;t, and enabled us to &s;tretch along the &s;hore, till two the next morning, when we &s;uddenly got into &s;ix fa|thoms water, being then &s;ix miles from the land. After we had edged off a little, our depth of wa|ter gradually increa&s;ed; and, at twelve o'clock, our &s;oundings were twenty fathoms. Round I&s;land, at this time, bore north 5&deg; ea&s;t; and the we&s;tern extreme of the coa&s;t was &s;even leagues di&s;tant, bearing north 16&deg; we&s;t. It is an elevat|ed point, to which the appellation of Calm Point was given, from our having calm weather while we were off it. To the north-we&s;tward of Round I&s;land, we di&s;cerned two or three hillocks which had an in&s;ular appearance; and perhaps they may be I&s;lands, for we had but a di&s;tant pro&s;pect of this particular part of the coa&s;t.</P>
<P>We advanced but &s;lowly on the 14th and 15th, having little wind, and, at times, a very thick fog. Our &s;oundings were from twenty-&s;ix to
<PB N="10" REF="030274_0833_0FE5733605757600">
fourteen fathoms; and we had pretty good &s;uc|ce&s;s in fi&s;hing, for we caught plenty of cod, and &s;ome flac fi&s;h. On Thur&s;day the 16th at five o'clock in the morning, the fog clearing up, we found our&s;elves nearer the &s;hore than we expect|ed. Calm Point bore north 72&deg; ea&s;t, and a point about eight leagues from it, in a we&s;terly direc|tion, bore north 3&deg; ea&s;t, only three miles di&s;tant. Betwixt the&s;e two points, the coa&s;t forms a bay in &s;everal parts of which the land could &s;carcely be &s;een from the ma&s;t-head. There is another bay on the north-we&s;tern &s;ide of the la&s;t-men|tioned point, between it and a high promon|tory, which now bore north 36&deg; we&s;t, at the di&s;|tance of &s;ixteen miles. About nine o'clock, Cap|tain Cook di&s;patched Lieutenant William&s;on to this promontory, with orders to go a&s;hore, and ob&s;erve what direction the coa&s;t a&s;&s;umed beyond it, and what was the produce of the country; which, when viewed from the &s;hips, had but a &s;teril a&s;pect. We here found the flood tide &s;et|ting &s;trongly towards the north-we&s;t, along the coa&s;t. At twelve o'clock it was high water, and we ca&s;t anchor at the di&s;tance of twelve miles from the &s;hore, in twenty-four fathoms water. In the afternoon, about five, the tide beginning to make in our favour, we weighed, and drove with it, there being no wind.</P>
<P>Mr. William&s;on, at his return, reported, that he had landed on the point, and, having a&s;cended

the mo&s;t elevated hill, found, that the mo&s;t di&s;+tant part of the coa&s;t in &s;ight was nearly in a northerly direction. He took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the country in the name of his Britannic Maje&s;ty, and left on the hill a bottle contai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing a paper, on which the names of our &s;hips, and of their commanders, and the date of the di&s;covery, were in&s;cribed. The promontory, which he named Cape Newenham, is a rocky point, of con&s;ider|able height; and &s;tands in the longitude of 197&deg; 36&deg; ea&s;t, and in the latitude of 58&deg; 4<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&prime; north. Over it, or within it, two lofty hills ri&s;e one be|hind the other; of which the innermo&s;t, or ea&s;t|ernmo&s;t, is the highe&s;t. The country, as far as Mr. William&s;on could di&s;cern, produces not a &s;ingle tree or &s;hrub. The hills were naked; but on the lower grounds, there grew gra&s;s and plants of various kinds, very few of which were at this time in flower. He met with no other animals than a doe and her fawn, and a dead &s;ea-hor&s;e or cow that lay upon the beach. Of the latter ani|mals we had lately &s;een a con&s;iderable number.</P>
<P>The coa&s;t, as we have already mentioned, a&s;|&s;uming a northerly direction from Cape Newen|ham, that cape is the northern boundary of the exten&s;ive bay and gulph, &s;ituate before the river Bri&s;tol, which in honour of the Admiral Earl of Bri&s;tol, received from the Commodore the de|nomination of Bri&s;tol Bay. Cape Ooneemak forms the &s;outhern limit of this bay; and is
<PB N="12" REF="030274_0835_0FE573466727AA98">
eighty-two leagues di&s;tant, in the direction of &s;outh &s;outh-we&s;t, from Cape Newenham.</P>
<P>A light breeze ari&s;ing about eight o'clock in the evening, and &s;ettling at &s;outh-&s;outh-ea&s;t, we &s;teered to the north-we&s;t, and north-north-we&s;t round Cape Newenham; which at twelve the following day, was four leagues di&s;tant, bearing &s;outh by ea&s;t. Our &s;oundings, at this time, were &s;eventeen fathoms; the mo&s;t advanced land to|wards the north bore north 30&deg; ea&s;t; and the neare&s;t part of the coa&s;t was three leagues and a half di&s;tant. During the whole afternoon, there was but little wind; &s;o that, by ten o'clock in the evening, we had only proceeded three leagues on a northerly cour&s;e.</P>
<P>We &s;teered north by we&s;t till eight o'clock the next morning, (Saturday the 18th) when, the depth of water &s;uddenly decrea&s;ing to &s;even and five fathoms, we brought too, till a boat from each of our &s;hips was &s;ent a-head to &s;ound, and then &s;teered to the north-ea&s;t. At noon, the water was deepened to &s;eventeen fathoms. Cape Newen|ham was now eleven or twelve leagues di&s;tant, bearing &s;outh 9&deg; ea&s;t; the north-ea&s;tern extre|mity of the land in &s;ight bore north 66&deg; ea&s;t; and the di&s;tance of the neare&s;t &s;hore was four or five leagues. Our pre&s;ent latitude was 59&deg; 16&prime; north. Between Cape Newenham and this lati|tude, the coa&s;t con&s;i&s;ts of low land and hills, and &s;eemed to form &s;everal bays.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="030274_0836_0FE5734AC1C487A8">Before one o'clock, the boats a-head di&s;played the &s;ignal of &s;hoal water. They had, indeed, only two fathoms; and at the &s;ame time, the &s;hips were in &s;ix fathoms water. By hauling more to the north, we continued nearly in the &s;ame depth till between five and &s;ix o'clock, when our boats finding le&s;s and le&s;s water, Captain Cook made the &s;ignal to the Di&s;covery, which was then a-head to ca&s;t anchor, and both &s;hips &s;oon came to. In bringing up the Re&s;olution, her cable parted at the clinch, &s;o that we were obliged to make u&s;e of the other anchor. We rode in &s;ix fathoms water, over a bottom of &s;and, at the di&s;tance of four or five leagues from the continent. Cape Newenham now bore &s;outh, &s;ixteen or &s;eventeen leagues di&s;tant; the farthe&s;t hills we could perceive towards the north, bore north-ea&s;t by ea&s;t; and there was low land &s;tretch|ing out from the more elevated land, as far as north by ea&s;t. Without this there was a &s;hoal of &s;tones and &s;and, dry at half ebb. The two ma&s;|ters having been &s;ent, each in a boat, to &s;ound between this &s;hoal and the coa&s;t, reported, on their return, that there was a channel, in which the &s;oundings were &s;ix and &s;even fathoms, but that it was rather narrow and intricate.</P>
<P>We attempted, at low water to get a haw&s;er round the lo&s;t anchor, but we did not then meet with &s;ucce&s;s. However, being re&s;olved not to leave it behind us, while there was any pro&s;pect
<PB N="14" REF="030274_0837_0FE573378B3B8CA0">
of recovering it, we per&s;evered in our endeavours; and, at length, in the evening of the 20th, we &s;ucceeded. While we were thus occupied, the Commodore ordered Captain Clerke to di&s;patch his ma&s;ter in a boat to &s;earch for a ba&s;&s;age in a &s;outh-we&s;t direction. He accordingly did &s;o, but no channel was ob&s;erved in that puarter; nor did it appear that there was any other way to get clear of the &s;hoals, than by returning by the &s;ame track in which we had entered. For though by following the channel we were now in, we might perhaps have got further down the coa&s;t; and though this channel might probably have carried us at la&s;t to the northward, clear of the &s;hoals, yet the attempt would have been attend|ed with extreme hazard; and, in ca&s;e of ill &s;uc|ce&s;s, there would have been a great lo&s;s of time that we could not conveniently &s;pare. The&s;e rea&s;ons induced the Commodore to return by the way which had brought us in, and thus avoid the &s;hoals.</P>
<P>The longitude of our pre&s;ent &s;tation, by lunar ob&s;ervations, was 197&deg; 45&prime; 48&Prime; ea&s;t, and the latitude 59&deg; 37&prime; 30&Prime; north. The mo&s;t northern part of the coa&s;t, that we could di&s;cern from this &s;tation was &s;uppo&s;ed to be &s;ituate in the latitude of 60&deg;. It formed, to appearance, a low point, which received the name of Shoal Ne&s;s. The tide of flood &s;ets to the northward, and the ebb to the &s;outhward: it ri&s;es and falls five or &s;ix

feet upon a perpendicular; and we reckon that it is high water at eight o'clock, on the full and change days.</P>
<P>At three in the morning of the 21&s;t, we weigh|ed anchor with a gentle breeze at north-north-we&s;t, and &s;teered back to the &s;outh, having three boats a-head employed in &s;ounding. Notwith|&s;tanding this precaution, we met with greater difficulty in returning than we had found in ad|vancing; and were at length under the nece&s;&s;ity of anchoring, to avoid the danger of running upon a &s;hoal that had only a depth of five feet. While we lay at anchor, twenty-&s;even Americans each in a &s;eparate canoe, came off to the &s;hips, which they approached with &s;ome degree of cau|tion. As they advanced, they hollowed and opened their arms; thereby intimating, as we under&s;tood, their peaceable intentions. Some of them, at la&s;t, came near enough to receive a few trifling articles which we threw to them. This gave encouragement to the others to venture a|long-&s;ide; and a traffic quickly commenced be|tween them and our people, who obtained wooden ve&s;&s;els, bows, darts, arrows, dre&s;&s;es of &s;kins, &amp;c. in exchange for which the natives excepted what|ever we offered them. They appeared to be the &s;ame &s;ort of people, with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> we had met with all along this coa&s;t; and they wore in their lips and no&s;es the &s;ame &s;pecies of ornaments, but were not &s;o well cloathed, and were far more dirty.
<PB N="16" REF="030274_0839_0FE5736C0C39C2C0">
They &s;eemed to be perfectly unacquainted with any civilized nation; they were ignorant of the u&s;e of tobacco; nor did we ob&s;erve in their po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion any foreign article, unle&s;s a knife may be con&s;idered as &s;uch. This, indeed, was nothing more than a piece of common iron fitted in a handle made of wood, &s;o as to &s;erve the pur|po&s;e of a knife. They, however, &s;o well knew the u&s;e and value of this in&s;trument, that it &s;eem|ed to be almo&s;t the only article they were de|&s;irous of.</P>
<P>The hair of mo&s;t of them were &s;haved, or cut &s;hort off, a few locks only being left on one &s;ide, or behind. They wore as a covering for their heads, a hood of &s;kins, and a bonnet, which was &s;eemingly of wood. One part of their dre&s;s, which we procured from them, was a kind of girdle, made of &s;kin in a very neat manner, with trappings depending from it and pa&s;&s;ing betwixt the thighs, &s;o as to conceal the adjacent parts. From the u&s;e of this girdle, it is probable that they &s;ome times go in other re&s;pects naked, even in this high northern latitude; for it can &s;carcely be &s;uppo&s;ed that they wear it under their other clothing. Their canoes were covered with &s;kins, like tho&s;e we had lately &s;een; but they were broader, and the hole wherein the per&s;on &s;its we wider than in any of tho&s;e we had before met with. Our boats returning from &s;ounding ap|peared to give them &s;ome alarm, &s;o that they all
<PB N="17" REF="030274_0840_0FE57342EC9BAD80">
departed &s;ooner than perhaps they otherwi&s;e would have done.</P>
<P>We did not get clear of the &s;hoals before the evening of Wedne&s;day the 22d; and then we dur&s;t not venture to &s;teer towards the we&s;t during the night, but &s;pent it off Cape Newenham. At day-break, on the 23d, we &s;tood to the north-we&s;tward, the Di&s;covery being ordered to go a|head. Before we had proceeded two leagues, our &s;oundings decrea&s;ed to &s;ix fathoms. Being ap|prehen&s;ive, that, if we continued this cour&s;e, we &s;hould meet with le&s;s and le&s;s water, we hauled to the &s;outh, with a fre&s;h ea&s;terly breeze. This cour&s;e gradually brought us into eighteen fathoms water, upon which we ventured to &s;teer a little we&s;terly, and afterwards due we&s;t, when we at length found twenty-&s;ix fathoms. At noon, on the 24th, our longitude, by ob&s;ervation, was 194&deg; 22&prime; ea&s;t, and our latitude. 58&deg; 7&prime; north. About three leagues to the we&s;t of this &s;ituation, our &s;oundings were twenty-eight fathoms; and we then &s;teered we&s;t-north-we&s;t, the depth of water gradually increa&s;ing to thirty-four fathoms. We &s;hould have &s;teered more northerly had not the wind prevented us.</P>
<P>In the evening of Saturday the 25th, having but little wind, and an exceedingly thick fog, we let go our anchors in thirty fathoms; our longi|tude being, at that time, 191&deg; 37&prime; ea&s;t, and our latitude 58&deg; 29&prime; north. About &s;ix o'clock the
<PB N="18" REF="030274_0841_0FE57322930DAF80">
next morning, the weather in &s;ome degree clear|ing up, we weighed, and with a gentle breeze at ea&s;t, &s;teered to the northward, our depth of water being from twenty-five to twenty-eight fathoms. After we had proceeded on this cour&s;e for the &s;pace of nine leagues, the wind veered to the north, &s;o that we were obliged to &s;teer more we&s;terly. The weather, for the mo&s;t part, con|tinued to be foggy, till about twelve o'clock on the 28th, when we had clear &s;un-&s;hine for a few hours, during which &s;everal lunar ob&s;ervations were made. The mean re&s;ult of the&s;e, reduced to noon, at which time our latitude was 59&deg; 55&prime; north, gave 190&deg; 6&prime; ea&s;t longitude, and the time-keeper gave 189&deg; 59&prime;.</P>
<P>Continuing our we&s;terly cour&s;e, we di&s;covered land at four in the morning of the 29th, bearing north-we&s;t by we&s;t, at the di&s;tance of &s;ix leagues. We &s;tood towards it till between ten and eleven, when we tacked in twenty-four fathoms, being then a league from the land, which bore north-north-we&s;t. It was the &s;outh-ea&s;tern extreme, and formed a perpendicular cliff of great height; upon which account, Captain Cook gave it the name of Point Upright. It &s;tands in the longi|tude of 187&deg; 30&prime; ea&s;t and in the latitude of 60&deg; 17&prime; north. More land was perceived to the we&s;t|ward of this point; and, at a clear interval, we di&s;cerned another portion of high land, bearing we&s;t by &s;outh; and this &s;eemed to be perfectly

&s;eparated from the other. We here ob&s;erved an amazing number of birds, &s;uch as guillemots, awks, &amp;c.</P>
<P>During the whole afternoon we had baffling light winds, which occa&s;ioned our progre&s;s to be but &s;low; and the weather was not &s;ufficiently clear, to enable us to determine the extent of the land that was before us. We conjectured that it was one of the many i&s;lands laid down in Mr. Staehlin's map of the New Northern Archipelogo; and we every moment expected to de&s;cry more of them.</P>
<P>On the 30th, at four o'clock in the afternoon, Point Upright was &s;ix leagues di&s;tant, bearing north-we&s;t by north. A light breeze now &s;pring|ing up at north-north-we&s;t, we &s;teered to the north-ea&s;tward till four the next morning, when the wind veered to the ca&s;t; we then tacked, and &s;tood to the north-we&s;t. The wind, not long after, &s;hifting to &s;outh-ea&s;t, we &s;teered north-ea&s;t by north; and continued this cour&s;e, with found|ings from thirty-five to twenty fathoms, till noon the following day (Augu&s;t 1.) Our latitude, at this time, was 60&deg; 58&prime; north, and our longitude was 191&deg; ea&s;t. The wind now becoming north-ea&s;terly, we fir&s;t made a &s;tretch of about ten leagues towards the north-we&s;t; and then, as we ob&s;erved no land in that direction, we &s;tood back to the ea&s;t for the &s;pace of fourteen or fifteen leagues, and met with a con&s;iderable quantity of
<PB N="20" REF="030274_0843_0FE57308043E97F8">
drift-wood. Our depth of water was from twen|ty-two to nineteen fathoms.</P>
<P>On Sunday, the 2d of Augu&s;t, variable light winds, with &s;howers of rain, prevailed the whole day. In the morning of the 3d, the wind &s;ettling in the &s;outh-ea&s;t quarter, we re&s;umed our north-ward cour&s;e. At twelve o'clock our &s;oundings were &s;ixteen fathoms, our latitude was 62&deg; 34&prime; north, longitude 192&deg; ea&s;t.</P>
<P>Between three and four o'clock this afternoon Mr. Ander&s;on, Surgeon of the Re&s;olution, ex|pired, after he had lingered under a con&s;umption for upwards of a twelve month. He was a &s;en|&s;ible, intelligent young man, and an agreeable companion. He had great &s;kill in his profe&s;&s;ion and had acquired a con&s;iderable portion of know|ledge in other departments of &s;cience. Our readers will doubtle&s;s have ob&s;erved, how u&s;eful an a&s;&s;i&s;tant he had proved in the cour&s;e of the voyage; and if his life had been prolonged to a later period, the public might have received from him many valuable communications re&s;pecting the natural hi&s;tory of the different places vi&s;ited by us. Soon after he had re&s;igned his breath, we di&s;covered land to the we&s;tward, at the di&s;|tance of twelve leagues. We &s;uppo&s;ed it to be an i&s;land; and the Commodore, to perpetuate the memory of the decea&s;ed, for whom he had a particular e&s;teem, di&s;tingui&s;hed it by the name of Ander&s;on's I&s;land. The following day Mr.
<PB N="21" REF="030274_0844_0FE5732C31172B50">
Law, Surgeon of the Di&s;covery, was removed into the Re&s;olution; and Mr. Samual, the Sur|geon's fir&s;t mate of the Re&s;olution, was appoint|ed to &s;ucceed Mr. Law as Surgeon of the Di&s;|covery.</P>
<P>At three in the afternoon, on the 4th we &s;aw land extending from north-north-ea&s;t to north-we&s;t. We &s;teered towards it till four, when, be|ing four or five miles di&s;tant from it, we tacked; and, not long afterwards, the wind failing, we let go our anchors in thirteen fathoms, over a &s;andy bottom, at the di&s;tance of about two leagues from land. Our latitude was now 64&deg; 27&prime; north, and longitude 194&deg; 18&prime; ea&s;t. We could, at intervals, di&s;cern the coa&s;t extending from ea&s;t to north-we&s;t, and an i&s;land of con&s;i|derable elevation, bearing we&s;t by north, nine miles di&s;tant.</P>
<P>The land before us, which we imagined to be the continent of America, appeared rather low next the &s;ea; but, inland, it ro&s;e in hills, which &s;eemed to be of a tolerable height. It had a greeni&s;h hue, and was apparently de&s;titute of wood, and free from &s;now. While our &s;hips remained at anchor, we ob&s;erved that the tide of flood came from the ea&s;tward, and &s;et to the we&s;tward, till between the hours of ten and eleven, from which time, till two o'clock the next morning, the &s;tream &s;et to the ea&s;t, and the water fell three feet. The flood running both
<PB N="22" REF="030274_0845_0FE57310206DAA90">
longer and &s;tronger than the ebb, we concluded, that there was a we&s;terly current be&s;ides the tide.</P>
<P>On Wedne&s;day the 5th, at ten o'clock in the morning, we ran down, and, &s;oon after, anchor|ed between the i&s;land and the continent in &s;even fathoms. Not long after we had ca&s;t anchor, Captain Cook, accompanied by Mr. King, and &s;ome other officers, landed upon the i&s;land. He hoped to have had from it a pro&s;pect of the coa&s;t and &s;ea towards the we&s;t; but, in that direction, the fog was &s;o thick, that the view was not more exten&s;ive than it was from our &s;hips. The coa&s;t of the continent &s;eemed to incline to the north, at a low point, named by us Point Rodney, which bore from the i&s;land north-we&s;t half we&s;t, at the di&s;tance of three or four leagues; but the high land, which a&s;&s;umed a more northerly di|rection, was perceived at a much greater di&s;tance.</P>
<P>The latitude of this i&s;land is 64&deg; 30&prime; north, and its longitude is 193&deg; 57&prime; ea&s;t. It is about twelve miles in circumference. The &s;urface of the ground principally con&s;i&s;ts of large loo&s;e &s;tones, covered in many places with mo&s;s and other vegetables' of which twenty or thirty dif|ferent &s;pecies were ob&s;erved, and mo&s;t of them were in flower. But the Captain &s;aw not a tree or &s;hrub, either on the i&s;land, or upon the neigh|bouring continent. Near the beach where he landed, was a con&s;iderable quantity of wild pur|&s;lain, long-wort, pea&s;e, &amp;c. &s;ome of which he
<PB N="23" REF="030274_0846_0FE573390FBB5BE8">
took on board for boiling. He &s;aw &s;everal plovers, and other &s;mall birds; a fox was al&s;o &s;een. He met with &s;ome decayed huts, built partly under ground. People had lately been upon the i&s;land, and it is more than probable, that they often re|pair to it, there being a beaten path from one end to the other. At a &s;mall di&s;tance from that part of the &s;hore where our gentlemen landed, they found a &s;ledge, which induced Captain Cook to give the i&s;land the appellation of Sledge I&s;land. It appeared to be &s;uch a one as is u&s;ed by the Ru&s;&s;ian in Kamt&s;chatka, for the purpo&s;e of con|veying goods from one place to another over the &s;now or ice. It was about twenty inches in bredath, and ten feet in length; had a &s;ort of rail-work on each &s;ide, and was &s;hod with bone. Its con&s;truction was admirable, and its various parts were put together with great neatne&s;s; &s;ome with wooden pins, but for the mo&s;t part with thongs or la&s;hings of whale-bone; in con&s;equence of which, the Captain imagined that it was en|tirely the workma&s;hip of the natives.</P>
<P>We weighed anchor at three o'clock in the morning of the 6th, and made &s;ail to the north-we&s;t, with alight breeze from the &s;outh-ward. Having afterwards but little wind, and that vari|able, we made but a &s;low progre&s;s; and, at eight o'clock in the evening, finding the &s;hips, getting into &s;hoal water, we anchored in &s;even fathoms, our di&s;tance from the coa&s;t being about two
<PB N="24" REF="030274_0847_0FE5730A2EE0D2F0">
leagues. Sledge I&s;land then bore &s;outh 51&deg; ea&s;t, nine or ten leagues di&s;tant. Soon after we had let go our anchors the weather, which had been mi&s;ty, cleared up, and we perceived high land extending from north 40&deg; ea&s;t to north 30&deg; we&s;t, &s;eemingly disjoined from the coa&s;t near which we lay at anchor, which appeared to extend to the north-ea&s;tward. We at the &s;ame time &s;aw an i&s;land bearing north 81&deg; we&s;t, at the di&s;tance of eight or nine leagues. It &s;eemed to be of a &s;mall extent, and was named King's I&s;land. We rode at anchor till eight the next morning, when we weighed, and &s;teered a north-we&s;t cour&s;e. The weather being clear towards the evening, we ob|tained a &s;ight of the north-we&s;tern land, di&s;tant about three leagues. We pa&s;&s;ed the night in making &s;hort boards, the weather being rainy and mi&s;ty, and the wind incon&s;iderable. Be|tween four and five in the morning of the 8th, we again had a &s;ight of the north-we&s;t land; and, not long afterwards, having a calm, and being driven by a current towards the &s;hore, we thought proper to anchor in twelve fathoms water, at the di&s;tance of about two miles from the coa&s;t. Over the we&s;tern extremity is a lofty peaked hill, &s;ituate in the longitude of 192&deg; 18&prime; ea&s;t, and in the lati|tude of 65&deg; 36&prime; north. A north-ea&s;terly breeze &s;pringing up at eight o'clock, we weighed, and made &s;ail to the &s;outh-ea&s;tward, hoping to find a pa&s;&s;age between this north-we&s;t land and the
<PB N="25" REF="030274_0848_0FE57371271883B0">
coa&s;t, near which we had ca&s;t anchor in the even|ing of the 6th. But we quickly got into &s;even fathoms water, and perceived low land con|necting the two coa&s;ts, and the elevated land behind it.</P>
<P>Convinced that the whole was a continued coa&s;t, we now tacked, and &s;teered for its north-we&s;tern-part, near which we anchored in &s;even|teen fathoms. The weather, at pre&s;ent, was very thick and rainy: but, at four the next morning, it cleared up, and enabled us to di&s;cern the neigh|bouring land. A lofty &s;teep rock or i&s;land bore we&s;t by &s;outh; another i&s;land to the northward of it, and con&s;iderably larger, bore we&s;t by north; the peaked hill before-mentioned, &s;outh-ea&s;t by ea&s;t; and the point that was under it, &s;outh 32&deg; ea&s;t. Under this hill is &s;ome low land, extending towards the north-we&s;t, the extreme point of which was now about one league di&s;tant, bear|ing north-ea&s;t by ea&s;t. Over it, and al&s;o beyond it, we ob&s;erved &s;ome high land, which we imagined was a continuation of the continent.</P>
<P>This point of land, which the Commodore di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of Cape Prince of Wales, is the we&s;tern extreme of all America hitherto known. It &s;tands in the longitude of 191&deg; 4&prime; ea&s;t, and in the latitude 65&deg; 46&prime; north. We fancied that we &s;aw &s;ome people on the coa&s;t: and, perhaps, we were not mi&s;taken in our &s;uppo&s;ition, as &s;ome elevations like &s;tages,
<PB N="26" REF="030274_0849_0FE57372B6282E78">
and others re&s;embling huts, were ob&s;erved at the &s;ame place.</P>
<P>At eight o'clock this morning, a faint norther|ly breeze ari&s;ing, we weighed anchor: but our &s;ails were &s;carcely &s;et, when it began to blow and rain with great violence, there being at the &s;ame time, mi&s;ty weather. The wind and cur|rent were in contrary directions, rai&s;ing &s;uch a &s;ea, that it often broke into the &s;hip. Having plied to windward, with little effect, till two o'clock in the afternoon, we &s;tood for the i&s;land which we had perceived to the we&s;tward, intend|ing to ca&s;t anchor under it till the gale &s;hould abate. But, upon our nearer approach to this land, we found that it was compo&s;ed of two &s;mall i&s;lands, neither of which exceeded three or four leagues in circumference. As the&s;e could afford us little &s;helter, we did not come to an anchor, but continued to &s;tretch towards the we&s;t; and, about eight o'clock in the evening, we &s;aw land extending from north-north-we&s;t to we&s;t by &s;outh, the di&s;tance of the neare&s;t part being &s;ix leagues. We &s;tood on till ten o'clock, and then made a board towards the ea&s;t, in order to pa&s;s the night.</P>
<P>On Monday the 10th, at break of day, we re|&s;umed our we&s;tward cour&s;e for the land &s;een by us the preceding evening. At eleven minutes after &s;even o'clock, it extended from &s;outh 72&deg; we&s;t, to north 51&prime; ea&s;t. Betwixt the &s;outh-we&s;tern extremity, and a point bearing we&s;t, &s;ix

miles di&s;tant, the coa&s;t forms a &s;pacious bay, in which we dropped our anchors at ten in the fore|noon, about two miles from the northern &s;hore over a gravelly bottom, at the depth of ten fathoms. The nothern point of this bay bore north 43&deg; ea&s;t; its &s;outhern point &s;outh 58&deg; we&s;t; the bottom of the bay, north 60&deg; we&s;t, between two and three leagues di&s;tant; and the two i&s;lands that we had pa&s;&s;ed the preceding day, were at the di&s;tance of fourteen leagues, bearing north 72&deg; ea&s;t.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>WHILE we were &s;teering for this bay, we ob&s;erved on the north &s;hore, a village, and &s;ome people, who &s;eemed to have been thrown into confu&s;ion, or fear, at the &s;ight of our ve&s;&s;els. We could plainly perceive per&s;ons running up the country with burdens upon their &s;houlders. At this village Captain Cook propo&s;ed to land; and accordingly, went with three armed boats, accompanied by &s;ome of the officers. Thirty or forty men, each of whom was armed with a &s;pon|toon, bow, and arrows, &s;tood drawn up on an eminence near the hou&s;es; three of them came
<PB N="29" REF="030274_0852_0FE5737D9F8277A0">
down towards the &s;hore, on the approach of our gentlemen, and were &s;o polite as to pull off their caps, and make them low bows. Though this civility was returned, it did not in&s;pire them with &s;ufficient confidence to wait for the landing of our party; for, the in&s;tant they put the boats a&s;hore the natives retired. Captain Cook fol|lowed them alone, without any thing in his hand; and, by &s;igns and ge&s;tures prevailed on them to &s;top, and accept &s;ome trifling pre&s;ents; in return for the&s;e, they gave him two fox-&s;kins, and a couple of &s;ea hor&s;e teeth. The Captain was of opinion that they had brought the&s;e articles down with them for the purpo&s;e of pre&s;enting them to him, even if they had expected no return.</P>
<P>They &s;eemed very timid and cautious; inti|mating their de&s;ire, by &s;igns, that no more of our people &s;hould be &s;uffered to come up. On the Captain's laying his hand on the &s;houlder of one of them, he &s;tarted back &s;everal paces; in proportion as he advanced, they retreated, al|ways in the attitude of being ready to make u&s;e of their &s;pears; while tho&s;e on the eminence, were prepared to &s;upport them with their arrows. In|&s;en&s;ibly, the Captain, and two or three of his companions, introduced them&s;elves among them. The di&s;tribution of a few beads among &s;ome of them, &s;oon created a degree of confidence, &s;o that they were not alarmed, when the Captain
<PB N="30" REF="030274_0853_0FE5737F24DE08B8">
was joined by a few more of his people; and, in a &s;hort time, a kind of traffic was entered into. In exchange for tobacco, knives, beads, and other articles, they gave a few arrows, and &s;ome of their cloathing; but nothing that our people had to offer, could induce them to part with a &s;pear or a bow. The&s;e they held in continual readi|ne&s;s, never quitting them, except at one time, when four or five per&s;ons laid theirs down, while they favoured our party with a &s;ong and a dance; and even then, they placed them in &s;uch a manner, that they could lay hold of them in a moment.</P>
<P>Their arrows were pointed either with &s;tone or bone, but very few of them had barbs; and &s;ome of them had a round blunt point. What u&s;e the&s;e are applied to, we cannot &s;ay, unle&s;s it be to kill &s;mall animals without damaging the &s;kin.</P>
<P>The&s;e bows were &s;uch as we had ob&s;erved on the American coa&s;t: their &s;pontoons, or &s;pears, were of iron or &s;teel, and of European or A&s;iatic work|man&s;hip: and con&s;iderable pains had been taken to embelli&s;h them with carving, and inlayings of bra&s;s and of a white metal. Tho&s;e who &s;tood with bows and arrows in their hands, had the &s;pear &s;lung by a leathern &s;trap over their right &s;houlder. A leathern quiver, &s;lung over their left &s;houlder, &s;erved to contain arrows; and &s;ome of the&s;e quivers were exceedingly beautiful, being made of red leather, on which was a very neat em|broidery,
<PB N="31" REF="030274_0854_0FE573810CB017B8">
and other ornaments. Several other things, and particularly their clothing, indicated a degree of ingenuity, far &s;urpa&s;&s;ing what any one would expect to find among &s;o northern a people.</P>
<P>All the Americans we had &s;een &s;ince our ar|rival on that coa&s;t, had round chubby faces, and high cheek-bones, and were rather low of &s;tature. The people among whom we now were, far from re&s;embling them, had long vi&s;ages, and were &s;tout and well made: upon the whole, they ap|peared to be a very different nation. No women, nor children of either &s;ex, were ob&s;erved, nor any aged per&s;ons, except one man who&s;e head was bald, and he was the only one who bore no arms: the other &s;eemed to be &s;elect men, and rather under than above the middle age. The elderly man had a black mark acro&s;s his face, which was not perceived in any others; all of them had their ears perforated, and &s;ome had gla&s;s beads hanging to them. The&s;e were the only fixed ornaments &s;een about them, for they wear none to their lips: this is another particular, in which they differ from the Americans we had lately &s;een.</P>
<P>Their apparel con&s;i&s;ted of a pair of breeches, a cap, a frock, a pair of boots, and a pair of gloves, all made of the &s;kins of deer, dogs, &s;eals, and other animals, and extremely well dre&s;&s;ed; &s;ome with the hair or fur on, and others without it. The caps were made in &s;uch a manner, as to
<PB N="32" REF="030274_0855_0FE5738293424858">
fit the head very clo&s;e; and be&s;ides the&s;e caps, which were worn by mo&s;t of them, we procured from them &s;ome hoods, made of dog-&s;kins, that were &s;ufficiently large to cover both head and &s;houlders. Their hair was apparently black, but their heads were either &s;haved, or the hair cut clo&s;e off and none of them wore beards. Of the few articles which they obtained from our people, knives and tobacco were what they &s;et the mo&s;t value upon.</P>
<P>The village was compo&s;ed both of their winter and their &s;ummer habitation; the former are ex|actly like a vault, the floor of which is &s;unk below the &s;urface of the earth. One of them, which Captain Cook examined, was of an oval figure, about twenty feet in length, and twelve or more in height; the framing con&s;i&s;ted of wood, and the ribs of whales, judiciou&s;ly di&s;po&s;ed, and bound together with &s;maller materials of the &s;ame kind. Over this framing, a covering of &s;trong coar&s;e gra&s;s was laid, and that again was covered with earth; &s;o that on the out&s;ide, the hou&s;e had the apperance of a little hillock, &s;upported by a wall of &s;tone, of the height of three or four feet, which was built round the two &s;ides, and one end. At the other end of the habitation, the earth was rai&s;ed &s;loping, to walk up to the entrance, which was by a hole in the top of the roof, over that end. The floor was boarded, and under it was a &s;ort of cellar, in which the Captain &s;aw nothing but water; at the end of each hou&s;e was a vaulted

<PB N="33" REF="030274_0857_0FE5731F2933BAC0">
room; which he &s;uppo&s;ed was a &s;tore-room. The&s;e &s;tore-rooms communicated, by a dark pa&s;&s;age, with the hou&s;e; and with the open air by a hole in the roof, which was even with the ground one walked upon; they cannot be &s;aid to be en|tirely below ground; for one end extended to the edge of the hill, along which they were made, and which was built up with &s;tone. Over it &s;tood a kind of centry-box; or tower, formed of the large bones of great fi&s;h.</P>
<P>Their &s;ummer huts were of a tolerable &s;ize, and circular, being brought to a point at the top. Slight poles and bones, covered with the &s;kins of &s;ea-animals, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ompo&s;ed the framing. Captain Cook examined the in&s;ide of one: their was a fire place ju&s;t within the door, where a few wooden ve&s;&s;els were depo&s;ited, all very dirty. Their bed-places were clo&s;e to the &s;ide, and occupied about one-half of the circuit: &s;ome degree of pri|vacy &s;eemed to be ob&s;erved; for there were &s;eve|ral partitions, made with &s;kins. The bed and bedding con&s;i&s;ted of deer-&s;kins, and mo&s;t of them were clean and dry.</P>
<P>About the hou&s;es were erected &s;everal &s;tages, ten or twelve feet in height, &s;uch as we had &s;een on &s;ome parts of the American coa&s;t. They were compo&s;ed entirely of bones, and were appa|rently intended for drying their fi&s;h and &s;kins, which were thus placed out of reach of their dogs, of which they had great numbers. The&s;e
<PB N="34" REF="030274_0858_0FE573864726DB38">
dogs are of the fox kind, rather large, and of different colours, with long &s;oft hair, that re&s;em|bles wool. They are, in all probability, u&s;ed for the purpo&s;e of drawing their &s;ledges, in water; for it appears that they have &s;ledges, as the Cap|tain &s;aw many of them laid up in one of their waner huts. It is, likewi&s;e, not improbable, that dogs con&s;titute a part of their food, for &s;everal lay dead, which had been killed that morning.</P>
<P>The canoes of the&s;e people are of the &s;ame kind with tho&s;e of the northern Americans, &s;ome both of the large and &s;mall &s;ort, being &s;een lying in a creek near the village.</P>
<P>From the large bones of fi&s;h, and other &s;ea-animals, it appeared, that the &s;ea furni&s;hed them with the greater part of their &s;ub&s;i&s;tance. The country &s;eemed extremely barren, as our gentle|men &s;aw not a tree or &s;hrub. At &s;ome di&s;tance towards the we&s;t, they ob&s;erved a ridge of moun|tains covered with &s;now, that had fallen not long before.</P>
<P>At fir&s;t, &s;ome of us &s;uppo&s;ed this land to be a part of i&s;land of Ala&s;chka, laid down in Mr. Staehlin's map before mentioned; but from the appearance of the coa&s;t, the &s;ituation of the op|po&s;ite &s;hore of America, and from the longitude, we &s;oon conjectured that it was, more probably, the country of the T&s;chut&s;ki, or the ea&s;tern extre|mity of A&s;ia, explored by Beering in the year
<PB N="35" REF="030274_0859_0FE57388254D7FE0">
1728. In admitting this, however, without far|ther examination, we mu&s;t have pronounced Mr. Staehlin's map, and his account of the new north|ern Archipelago, to be either remarkably erro|neous, even in latitude, or el&s;e to be a mere fic|tion&punc; a judgement which we would not pre&s;ume to pa&s;s, upon a publication &s;o re&s;pectably vouched, without producing the mo&s;t deci&s;ive proofs.</P>
<P>After our party had remained with the&s;e people between two and three hours, they returned on board; and, &s;oon after, the wind becoming &s;outh|erly, we weighed anchor, &s;tood out of the bay and &s;teered to the north-ea&s;t, between the coa&s;t and the two i&s;lands. At twelve o'clock the next day (Augu&s;t 11) the former extended from &s;outh 80&deg; we&s;t, to north 84&deg; we&s;t; the latter bore &s;outh 40&deg; we&s;t; and the peaked hill, over Cape Prince of Wales, bore &s;outh 36&deg; ea&s;t. The latitude of the &s;hip was 66&deg; 5&prime; north, the longitude 191&deg; 19&prime; ea&s;t; our &s;oundings were twenty eight fathoms; and our po&s;ition nearly in the middle of the chan|nel, between the two coa&s;ts, each being at the di&s;tance of about &s;even leagues.</P>
<P>We &s;teered to the ea&s;tward from this &s;tation, in order to make a nearer approach to the Ame|rican coa&s;t. In this cour&s;e the water gradually &s;hoaled; and there being very little wind, and all our endeavours to increa&s;e our depth failing, we were obliged at la&s;t to ca&s;t anchor in &s;ix fa|thoms; which was the only remedy remaining,
<PB N="36" REF="030274_0860_0FE57389A9F2CCD0">
to prevent the &s;hips driving into more &s;hallow water. The neare&s;t part of the we&s;tern land bore we&s;t, twelve leagues di&s;tant; the peaked mountain over Cape Prince of Wales, bore &s;outh l6&deg; we&s;t; and the mo&s;t northern part of the Ame|rican continent in &s;ight, ea&s;t-&s;outh-ea&s;t; the di&s;|tance of the neare&s;t part being about four leagues. After we had anchored, a boat was di&s;patched to &s;ound, and the water was found to &s;hoal gradu|ally towards the land. While our &s;hips lay at anchor, which was from &s;ix to nine in the even|ing, we perceived little or no current, nor did we ob&s;erve that the water ro&s;e or fell.</P>
<P>A northerly breeze &s;pringing up, we weighed and made &s;ail to the we&s;tward, which cour&s;e &s;oon brought us into deep water; and, during the 12th, we plied to the northward in &s;ight of both coa&s;ts, but we kept neare&s;t to that of America. On the 13th, at four in the afternoon, a breeze ari&s;ing at &s;outh, we &s;teered north-ea&s;t by north, till four o'clock the next morning, when, &s;eeing no land, we directed our cour&s;e ea&s;t by north; and between the hours of nine and ten, land ap|peared, which we &s;uppo&s;ed was a continuation of the continent. It extended from ea&s;t by &s;outh, to ea&s;t by north; and, not long afterwards, we de&s;cried more land, bearing north by ea&s;t. Com|ing rather &s;uddenly into thirteen fathoms water, at two in the afternoon, we made a trip off till four, when we again &s;tood in for the land; which
<PB N="37" REF="030274_0861_0FE5738B8A5E9A20">
&s;oon after, we &s;aw, extending from north to &s;outh-ea&s;t, the neare&s;t part being at the di&s;tance of three or four leagues. The coa&s;t here forms a point, named by us Point Mulgrave, which is &s;ituated in the latitude of 67&deg; 45&prime; north, and in the longitude of 194&deg; 51&prime; ea&s;t. The land &s;eemed to be very low near the &s;ea, but a little farther it ri&s;es into hills of a moderate height: the whole was free from &s;now, and apparently de&s;titute of wood. We now tacked, and bore away north-we&s;t by we&s;t; but, in a &s;hort time afterwards, thick weather, with rain, coming on, and the wind increa&s;ing, we hauled more to the we&s;t|ward. At two o'clock the next morning, the wind veered to &s;outh-we&s;t by &s;outh, and blew a &s;trong gale, which abated towards noon. We now &s;tood to the north-ea&s;t, till &s;ix the next morn|ing, when we &s;teered rather more ea&s;terly: in this run we met with &s;everal &s;ea-hor&s;es, and great numbers of birds; &s;ome of which re&s;embled &s;and-larks and others were not larger than hedge-&s;parrows. We al&s;o &s;aw &s;ome &s;hags, &s;o that we judged we were not far from land; but, having a thick fog, we could not expect to &s;ee any; and as the wind blew &s;trong, it was not deemed pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|dent to continue a cour&s;e which was mo&s;t likely to bring us to it. From the noon of this day, (the 16th of Augu&s;t) to &s;ix o'clock in the morn|ing of the following, we &s;teered ea&s;t by north; a cour&s;e which brought us into fifteen fathoms
<PB N="38" REF="030274_0862_0FE57391035CA820">
water. We now &s;teered north-ea&s;t by ea&s;t, think|ing, by &s;uch a cour&s;e, to increa&s;e our depth of water. Bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, in the &s;pace of &s;ix leagues, it &s;hoaled to eleven fathoms, which induced us to haul clo&s;e to the wind, that now blew at we&s;t. About twelve o'clock, both &s;un and moon were clearly &s;een at intervals, and we made &s;ome ha&s;ty ob&s;ervations for the longitude; which, reduced to noon, when the latitude was 70&deg; 33&prime; north, gave 197&deg; 41&prime; ea&s;t. The time-keeper, for the &s;ame time, gave 198&deg;</P>
<P>Some time in the forenoon, we perceived a brightne&s;s in the northern horizon, like that re|flected from ice, u&s;ually called the blink. Little notice was taken of it, from a &s;uppo&s;ition that it was improbable we &s;hould &s;o &s;oon meet with ice. The &s;harpne&s;s of the air, however, and gloomi|ne&s;s of the weather, for the two or three preced|ing days, &s;eemed to indicate &s;ome &s;udden change. About an hour afterwards, the &s;ight of an enor|mous ma&s;s of ice, left us no longer in any doubt re&s;pecting the cau&s;e of the brightne&s;s of the hori|zon. Between two and three o'clock we tacked clo&s;e to the edge of the ice, in twenty-two fa|thoms water, being then in the latitude of 70&deg; 41&prime; north, and unable to &s;tand on any farther: for the ice was perfectly impenetrable, and ex|tended from we&s;t by &s;outh, to ea&s;t by north, as far as the eye could reach. Here we met wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h great numbers of &s;ea-hor&s;es, &s;ome of which were
<PB N="39" REF="030274_0863_0FE57392A899AD40">
in the water, but far more upon the ice. The Commodore had thoughts of hoi&s;ting out the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oats to kill &s;ome of the&s;e animals; but, the wind fre&s;hening, he gave up the de&s;ign; and we con|tinued to ply towards the south&punc; or rather to|wards the we&s;t, for the wind came from that duar|ter. We made no progre&s;s; for, at twelve on the 18th, our latitude was 70&deg; 44&prime; north, and we were almo&s;t five leagues farther to the ea&s;t.</P>
<P>We were, at pre&s;ent, clo&s;e to the edge of the ice, which was as compact as wall, and appeared to be at lea&s;t ten or twelve feet in height: but, farther northward, it &s;eemed to be much higher. Its &s;urface was exceedingly rugged, and, in &s;everal places, we &s;aw pools of water upon it. We now &s;tood to the &s;outh, and, after running &s;ix leagues, &s;hoaled the water to &s;even fathoms; but it &s;oon increa&s;ed to the depth of nine fa|thoms. At this time, the weather, which had been hazy, becoming clearer, we &s;aw land ex|tending from &s;outh to &s;outh-ea&s;t by ea&s;t, at the di&s;tance of three or four miles&punc; The ea&s;tern ex|tremity forms a point, which was greatly encum|bered with ice, on which account it was di&s;tin|gui&s;hed by the name of Icy Cape. Its latitude is 70&deg; 29&prime; north, and its longitude 198&deg; 20&prime; ea&s;t. The other extreme of the land was lo&s;t in the ho|rizon; and we had no doubt of its being a con|tinuation of the continent of America. The Di&s;covery being about a mile a-&s;tern, and to lee|ward,
<PB N="40" REF="030274_0864_0FE573942FEC2870">
met with le&s;s depth of water than we did; and tacking on that account, the Commodore was obliged to tack al&s;o, to prevent &s;eperation.</P>
<P>Our pre&s;ent &s;ituation was very critical. We were upon a lee &s;hore in &s;hoal water; and the main body of the ice to windward, was driving down upon us. It was evident, that if we con|tinued much longer between it and the land, it would force us a&s;hore, unle&s;s it &s;hould chance to take the ground before us. It appeared almo&s;t to join the land to leeward, and the only direc|tion that was free from it, was to the &s;outh-we&s;t|ward. After making a &s;hort board to the north, Captain Cook made a &s;ignal for the Di&s;covery to tack, and his &s;hip tacked at the &s;ame time. The wind proved in &s;ome mea&s;ure favourable &s;o that we lay up &s;outh-we&s;t, and &s;outh-we&s;t by we&s;t.</P>
<P>On Wedne&s;day the 19th at eight in the morn|ing the wind veering to we&s;t, we tacked to the northward and, at twelve, the latitude was 70&deg; 6&prime; north, and the longitude 196&deg; 42&prime; ea&s;t. In this &s;ituation, we had a con&s;iderable quantity of d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ift ice about our &s;hips, and the main ice was about two leagues to the north. Between one and two, we got in with the edge of it. It was le&s;s compact than that which we had ob&s;erved to|wards the north; but it was too clo&s;e, and in too large pieces to attempt forcing the &s;hips through it. We &s;aw an amazing number of &s;ea-hor&s;es on the ice, and as we were in want of fre&s;h pro|vi&s;ions,

the boats from each &s;hip were di&s;patch|ed to procure &s;ome of them. By &s;even in the evening, we had received, on board the Re&s;o|lution, nine of the&s;e animals; which, till this time, we had &s;uppo&s;ed to be &s;ea cows; &s;o that we were greatly di&s;appointed, particularly &s;ome of the &s;ailors, who, on account of the novelty of the thing, had been fea&s;ting their eyes for &s;ome days pa&s;t. Nor would they now have been di&s;appointed, nor have known the difference, if there had not been two or three men on board, who had been in Greenland, and declared what animals the&s;e were, and that no per&s;on ever eat of them. Notwith&s;tanding this, we made them &s;erve us for provi&s;ions, and there were few of our people who did not prefer them to our &s;alt meat.</P>
<P>The fat of the&s;e animals, at fir&s;t, as &s;weet as marrow; but, in a few days, it becomes ran|cid, unle&s;s it is &s;alted, in which &s;tate it will keep much longer. The lean fle&s;h is coar&s;e and blacki&s;h and has a &s;trong ta&s;te: and the heart is almo&s;t as well ta&s;ted as that of a bullock. The fat, when melted, affords a good quantity of oil which burns very well in lamps; and their hides, which are of great thickne&s;s, were extremely u&s;e|ful about our rigging. The teeth, or tu&s;ks, of mo&s;t of them were, at this time, of a very &s;mall &s;ize; even &s;ome of the large&s;t and olde&s;t of the&s;e animals, had them not exceeding half a foot in
<PB N="42" REF="030274_0867_0FE5739A2E169968">
length. Hence we concluded, that they had lately &s;hed their old teeth.</P>
<P>They lie upon the ice in herds of many hun|dreds, huddling like &s;wine, one over the other; and they roar very loud; &s;o that in the night, or when the weather was foggy, they gave us notice of the vicinity of the ice, before we could di&s;cern it. We never found the whole herd &s;leep|ing, &s;ome of them being con&s;tantly upon the watch. The&s;e, on the reproach of the boat, would awake tho&s;e that were next to them; and the alarm being thus gradually communicated, the whole herd would pre&s;ently be awake. How|ever they were &s;eldom in a hurry to get away, before they had been once fired at. Then they would fall into the &s;ea, one over the other in the utmo&s;t confu&s;ion; and, if we did not happen, at the fir&s;t di&s;charge, to kill tho&s;e we fired at, we ge|nerally lo&s;t them, though mortally wounded.</P>
<P>They did not appear to us to be &s;o dangerous as &s;ome authors have repre&s;ented them, not even when they were attacked. They are, indeed, more &s;o, in apperrance, than in reality. Va&s;t multitudes of them would follow, and come clo&s;e up to the boats; but the fla&s;h of a mu&s;ket in the pan, or even the mere pointing of one at them, would &s;end them down in a moment. The fe|male will defend her young one to the very la&s;t, and at the expence of her own life, whether upon the ice or in the water. Nor will the young,
<PB N="43" REF="030274_0868_0FE5739CAF514FD0">
one quit the dam, though &s;he &s;hould have been killed; &s;o that, if you de&s;troy one, you are &s;ure of the other. The dam, when in the water, holds her young one between her fore &s;ins. Mr. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ennant, in his Synop&s;is of Quadrupeds, has given a very good de&s;cription of this animal un|der the name of the <HI>Arctic Walrus.</HI> Why it &s;hould be called a &s;ea-hor&s;e, is difficult to determine, unle&s;s the word be a corruption of the Ru&s;&s;ian name <HI>Mor&s;e</HI>; for they do no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> in the lea&s;t re&s;em|ble a hor&s;e. It is, doubtle&s;s, the &s;ame animal that is found in the Gulph of St. Lawrence, and there called a &s;ea-cow. It is certainly more like a cow than a hor&s;e; but this re&s;emblance con&s;i&s;ts in nothing but the &s;nout. In &s;hort, it is an ani|mal not unlike a &s;eal, but incomparably larger. The length of one of them, which was none of the large&s;t, was nine feet four inches from the &s;nout to the tail; the circumference of its body at the &s;houlder, was &s;even feet ten inches: its circumference near the hinder fins was five feet &s;ix inches, and the weight of the carca&s;e, with|out the head, &s;kin, or intrails, was eight hundred and fifty-four pounds. The head weighed forty-one pounds and a half, and the &s;kin two hundred and five pounds.</P>
<P>It may not be improper to remark, that, for &s;ome days before this time, we had often &s;een flocks of ducks flying to the &s;outh. They were of two &s;pecies, the one much larger than the
<PB N="44" REF="030274_0869_0FE5739E98FC02E8">
other. The larger &s;ort was of a brown colour; and of the &s;mall &s;ort, either the duck or drake was black and white, and the other brown. Some of our people &s;aid that they al&s;o &s;aw gee&s;e. This &s;eems to indicate, that there mu&s;t be land to the northward, where the&s;e birds, in the proper &s;ea&s;on, find &s;helter for breeding, and whence they were now on their return to a warmer climate.</P>
<P>Soon after we had got our &s;ea-hor&s;es on board, we were, in a manner, &s;urrounded with the ice, and had no means of clearing it, but by &s;teering to the &s;outhward, which we did till three o'clock the next morning, with a light we&s;terly breeze, and, in general, thick, foggy weather. Our &s;oundings were from twelve to fifteen fathoms. We then tacked and &s;tood to the northward till ton o'clock, when the wind &s;hifting to the north, we &s;tood to the we&s;t-&s;outh-we&s;t and we&s;t. At two in the afternoon, we fell in with the main ice, and kept along the edge of it, being partly directed by the roaring of the &s;ea-hor&s;es, for we had an ex|ceeding thick fog. Thus we continued &s;ailing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ill near midnight, when we got in among the loo&s;e pieces of ice.</P>
<P>The wind being ea&s;terly, and the fog very thick, we now hauled to the &s;outhward, and at ten the next morning, the weather clearing up, we &s;aw the American continent, extending from &s;outh by ea&s;t, to ea&s;t by &s;outh; and, at noon, from &s;outh-we&s;t half &s;outh to ea&s;t, the di&s;tance
<PB N="45" REF="030274_0870_0FE573A01DB79EC8">
of the neare&s;t part being five leagues. We were at pre&s;ent in the latitude of 69&deg; 32&prime; north, and in the longitude of 195&deg; 48&prime; ea&s;t; and, as the main ice was not far from us, it is evident, that it now covered a part of the &s;ea; which, a few days be|fore, had been free from it; and that it extended farther towards the &s;outh, than where we fir&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ell in with it.</P>
<P>During the afternoon we had but little wind; and the Ma&s;ter was &s;ent in a boat to ob&s;erve whe|ther there was any current, but he found none. We continued to &s;teer for the American land till eight o'clock, in order to obtain a nearer view of it, and to &s;earch for a harbour; but &s;ee|ing nothing that had the appearance of one, we again &s;tood to the north, with a gentle we&s;terly breeze. At this time, the coa&s;t extended from &s;outh-we&s;t to ea&s;t, the neare&s;t part being at the di&s;tance of four or five leagues. The &s;outhern extreme &s;eemed to form a point, to which the name of Cape <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i&s;burne was given. It is &s;ituate in the latitude of 69&deg; 5&prime; north, and in the longi|tude of 194&deg; 42&prime; ea&s;t, and appeared to be tole|rably high land, even down to the &s;ea; but there may be low land under it, which we might not then &s;ee, being not le&s;s than ten leagues di&s;tant from it. In almo&s;t every other part, as we ad|vanced to the north, we had found a low coa&s;t, from which the land ri&s;es to a moderate height. The coa&s;t now before us was free from &s;now, ex|cept

in one or two places, and had a greeni&s;h hue. But we could not di&s;cern any wood upon it.</P>
<P>On Saturday the 22d, the wind was &s;outherly, and the weather for the mo&s;t part foggy, with &s;ome intervals of &s;un&s;hine. At eight in the even|ing, we had a calm, which continued till mid|night, when we heard the &s;urge of the &s;ea da&s;h|ing again&s;t the ice, and had many loo&s;e pieces about us. A light breeze now ro&s;e at north-ea&s;t, and the fog being very thick, we &s;teered to the &s;outh to get clear of the ice. At eight the next morning, the fog di&s;per&s;ed, and we hauled towards the we&s;t; for the Commodore finding that he could not get to the north near the coa&s;t, by rea&s;on of the ice, re&s;olved to try what could be done at a di&s;tance from it; and as the wind &s;eemed to be fixed at north, he con&s;idered it as a favourable opportunity.</P>
<P>In our progre&s;s to the we&s;tward, the water gra|dually deepened to twenty-eight fathoms. With the northerly wind the air was &s;harp and cold; and we had fogs, &s;un&s;hine, &s;howers of &s;now and fleet alternately. On the 26th, at ten in the morning, we fell in with the ice. At twelve, it extended from north-we&s;t to ea&s;t by north, and &s;eemed to be thick and compact. We were now, by ob&s;erva|tion, in the latitude of 69&deg; 36&prime; north, and in the longitude of 184&deg; ea&s;t; and it now appeared that we had no better pro&s;pect of getting to the north here, than nearer the &s;hore.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="030274_0872_0FE573A84E869508">We continued &s;teering to the we&s;t, till five in the afternoon, when we were, in &s;ome degree, embayed by the ice, which was very clo&s;e in the north-we&s;t and north-ea&s;t quarters, with a great quantity of loo&s;e ice about the edge of the main body. At this time, we had baffling light airs, but the wind &s;oon &s;ettled at &s;outh, and increa&s;ed to a fre&s;h gale, accompanied with &s;howers of rain. We got the tack aboard, and &s;tretched to the ea&s;t, as this was the only direction in which the &s;ea was free from ice.</P>
<P>On Thur&s;day the 27th, at four in the morning, we tacked and &s;tood to the we&s;tward, and at &s;even o'clock in the evening, we were clo&s;e in with the edge of the ice, which lay ea&s;t-north-ea&s;t, and we&s;t-&s;outh-we&s;t, as far in each of tho&s;e directions as the eye could reach. There being but little wind, Captain Cook went with the boats, to ex|amine the &s;tate of the ice. He found it con&s;i&s;t|ing of loo&s;e pieces, of various extent, and &s;o clo&s;e together, that he could &s;carcely enter the outer edge with a boat; and it was as impracti|cable for the &s;hips to enter it, as if it had been &s;o many rocks. He particularly remarked, that it was all pure tran&s;parent ice, except the upper &s;urface, which was rather porous. It &s;eemed to be wholly compo&s;ed of frozen &s;now, and to have been all formed at &s;ea. For, not to in&s;i&s;t on the improbability of &s;uch prodigious ma&s;&s;es floating out of rivers, none of the productions of the land
<PB N="48" REF="030274_0873_0FE573AA158D1700">
were found incorporated, or mixed in it; which would certainly have been the ca&s;e, if it had been formed in rivers, either great or &s;mall.</P>
<P>The pieces of ice that formed the outer edge of the main body, were from forty or fifty yards in extent, to four or five; and the Captain judged, that the larger pieces reached thirty feet or more, under the &s;urface of the water. He al&s;o thought it highly improbable, that this ice could have been the production of the preceding winter alone. He was rather inclined to &s;uppo&s;e it to have been the production of many winters, It was equally improbable, in his opinion, that the little that now remained of the &s;ummer, could de&s;troy even the tenth part of what now &s;ub&s;i&s;ted of this great ma&s;s; for the &s;un had already ex|erted upon it the full force and influence of its rays. The &s;un, indeed, according to his judg|ment, contributes very little towards reducing the&s;e enormous ma&s;&s;es. For though that lumi|nary is above the horizon a con&s;iderable while, it &s;eldom &s;hines out for more than a few hours at a time, and frequently is not &s;een for &s;everal &s;ucce&s;&s;ive days. It is the wind, or rather the waves rai&s;ed by the wind, that brings down the bulk of the&s;e prodigious ma&s;&s;es, by grinding one piece again&s;t another, and by undermining and wa&s;hing away tho&s;e parts which are expo&s;ed to the &s;urge of the &s;ea. This was manife&s;t, from the Captain's ob&s;erving, that the upper &s;urface
<PB N="49" REF="030274_0874_0FE57328E096F0F8">
of many pieces had been partly wa&s;hed away, while the ba&s;e, or under part, continued firm for &s;everal fathoms round that which appeared above water, like a &s;hoal round a high rock. He mea|&s;ured the depth of water upon one, and found that it was fifteen feet, &s;o that the &s;hips might have &s;ailed over it. If he had not mea&s;ured this depth, he would have been unwilling to believe, that there was a &s;ufficient weight of ice above the &s;urface, to have &s;unk the other &s;o much be|low it. It may thus happen, that more ice is de&s;troyed in one tempe&s;tous &s;ea&s;on than is form|ed in &s;everal winters, and an endle&s;s accumula|tion of it is prevented. But that there is con|&s;tantly a remaining &s;tore, will be acknowledged by every one who has been upon the &s;pot.</P>
<P>A thick fog, which come on while the com|modore was thus employed with the boats, ha&s;|tened him aboard &s;ooner than he could have wi&s;hed, with one &s;ea-hor&s;e to each &s;hip. Our party had killed many, but could not wait to bring them off. The number of the&s;e animals, on all the ice that we had &s;een, is really a&s;toni&s;h|ing. We &s;pent the night &s;tanding off and on, among&s;t the drift ice, and at nine o'clock the next morning, the fog having in &s;ome degree di&s;|per&s;ed, boats from each of the &s;hips were di&s;|patched for &s;ea-hor&s;es; for our people by this time began to reli&s;h them, and tho&s;e we had be|fore furni&s;hed our&s;elves with, were all con&s;umed.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="030274_0875_0FE573ABB24ECCA8">At noon, our latitude was 69&deg; 17&prime; north, our longitude 183&deg; ea&s;t, and our depth of water was twenty-five fathoms. At two in the afternoon, having got on board as many &s;ea hor&s;es as were deemed &s;ufficient, and the wind fre&s;hening at &s;outh-&s;outh-ea&s;t, we hoi&s;ted in the boats, and &s;teered to the &s;outh-we&s;t. But being unable to weather the ice upon this tack, or to go through it, we made aboard to the ea&s;tward, till about eight o'clock, then re&s;umed our cour&s;e to the &s;outh-we&s;t, and were obliged before midnight, to tack again, on account of the ice. Not long after, the wind veering to the north we&s;t, and blowing a &s;tiff gale, we &s;tretched to the &s;outh-we&s;t, clo&s;e hauled.</P>
<P>On the 29th, in the morning, we &s;aw the main ice towards the north, and &s;oon after, perceived land bearing &s;outh-we&s;t by we&s;t. In a &s;hort time after this, more land was &s;een, bearing we&s;t. It &s;hewed it&s;elf in two hills, re&s;embling i&s;lands, but &s;oon the whole appeared connected. As we made a nearer approach to the land, the depth of water decrea&s;ed very fa&s;t, &s;o that, at twelve o'clock, when we tacked, we found only eight fathoms; being three miles from the coa&s;t, which extended from &s;outh 30&deg; ea&s;t, to north 60&deg; we&s;t. The lat|ter extremity terminating in bluff point, being one of the hills mentioned before.</P>
<P>The weather was now very hazy, with driz|zling rain; but, &s;oon afterwards, it cleared up
<PB N="51" REF="030274_0876_0FE573B1E66010F0">
particuarly to the &s;outhward, we&s;tward, and north|ward. This enabled us to have a tolerable view of the coa&s;t; which re&s;embles, in every re&s;pect, the oppo&s;ite coa&s;t of America; that is, low land next the &s;ea, with higher land farther back. It was totally di&s;titute of wood, and even of &s;now; but was probably, covered with a mo&s;&s;y &s;ub&s;tance, that gave it a browni&s;h hue. In the low ground that lay between the &s;ea and the high land, was a lake, extending to the &s;outh ea&s;tward farther than we could &s;ee. As we &s;tood off, the mo&s;t we&s;terly of the two hills above-mentioned, came open off the bluff point, in a north-we&s;t direction. It had the appearance of an i&s;land, but it might per|haps be connected with the other by low land, though we did not &s;ee it. And if that be the ca&s;e, there is a two-fold point, with a bay be|tween them. This point, which is rocky and &s;teep, received the name of Cape North. It is &s;ituated nearly in the latitude of 68&deg; 56&prime; north, and in the longitude of 180&deg; 51&prime; ea&s;t. The coa&s;t beyond it doubtle&s;s a&s;&s;umes a very we&s;terly direc|tion; for we could di&s;cern no land to the north|ward of it, though the horizon was there pretty clear. Wi&s;hing to &s;ee more of the coa&s;t to the we&s;tward, we tacked again, at two in the after|noon, thinking we &s;hould be able to weather Cape North; but finding we could not, the wind fre&s;hening, a thick fog ari&s;ing, with much &s;now, and being apprehen&s;ive of the ice coming down

upon us, the Commodore relinqui&s;hed the de&s;ign he had formed of plying to the we&s;tward, and again &s;tood off &s;hore.</P>
<P>The &s;ea&s;on was now &s;o far advanced, and the time when the fro&s;t generally &s;ets in was &s;o near, that Captain Cook did not think it con&s;i&s;tent with prudence, to make any farther attempts to di&s;co|ver a pa&s;&s;age into the Atlantic Ocean this year, in any direction, &s;o &s;mall was the probability of &s;ucce&s;s. His attention was now directed to the &s;earch of &s;ome place, where we might recruit our wood and water; and the object that principally occupied his thoughts was, how he &s;hould pa&s;s the winter, &s;o as to make &s;ome improvements in navigation and geography, and at the &s;ame time, be in a condition to return to the north-ward the en&s;uing &s;ummer, to pro&s;ecute his &s;earch of a pa&s;|&s;age into the Atlantic.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>HAVING &s;tood off till our foundings were eighteen fathoms, we made &s;ail to the ea&s;t|ward, along the coa&s;t, which, we were now pretty well convinced, could only be the continent of A&s;ia. The wind blowing fre&s;h, and there being, at the &s;ame time, a thick mi&s;t, and a very heavy fall of &s;now, it was requi&s;ite that we &s;hould pro|ceed with particular caution: we therefore brought too, for a few hours, in the night. Early the next morning, which was the 30th of Augu&s;t, we &s;teered &s;uch a cour&s;e as we judged mo&s;t likely to
<PB N="54" REF="030274_0879_0FE573B739F94348">
bring us in with the land, being guided, in a great mea&s;ure, by the land; for the weather was extremely thick and gloomy, with ince&s;&s;ant &s;howers of &s;now. At ten o'clock we obtained a &s;ight of the coa&s;t, which was at the di&s;tance of four miles, bearing &s;outh-we&s;t. Soon afterwards, our depth of water having decrea&s;ed to &s;even fathoms, we hauled off. A very low point now bore &s;outh-&s;outh-we&s;t, di&s;tant two or three miles; to the ea&s;tward of which there &s;eemed to be a narrow channel, that led into &s;ome water which we &s;aw over the point. It is not improbable, that the lake above-mentioned communicates here with the &s;ea.</P>
<P>About twelve o'clock, the mi&s;t di&s;per&s;ing, we had a view of the coa&s;t, which extended from &s;outh-ea&s;t to north-we&s;t by we&s;t. Some parts of it were apparently higher than others; but the greate&s;t part of it was rather low, with high land farther up the country. It was almo&s;t entirely covered with &s;now, which had fallen very lately. We ranged along the coa&s;t, at the di&s;tance of about two leagues, till ten o'clock in the evening, when we hauled off; but re&s;umed our cour&s;e ear|ly on the following morning, when we had ano|ther view of the coa&s;t, extending from we&s;t to &s;outh-ea&s;t by &s;outh. At eight o'clock, the ea&s;tern part bore &s;outh, and was found to be an i&s;land, which, at twelve, was four or five miles di&s;tant, bearing &s;outh-we&s;t half &s;outh. It is of a mode|rate
<PB N="55" REF="030274_0880_0FE573BE766A9A60">
height, between four and five miles in cir|cumference, with a &s;teep rocky coa&s;t. It is &s;ituated in the latitude of 67&deg; 45&prime; north, about three leagues from the continent; and is di&s;tin|gui&s;hed in the chart by the appellation of Bur|ney's I&s;land. The inland country, about this part, abounds with hills, &s;ome of which are of con&s;iderable elevation. The land in general was covered with &s;now, except a few &s;pots on the coa&s;t, which &s;till continued to be low, but &s;ome|what le&s;s &s;o than farther towards the we&s;t.</P>
<P>During the two preceding days, the mean height of the mercury in the thermometer had been frequently below the freezing point, and, in general, very little above it; in&s;omuch that the water, in the ve&s;&s;els upon deck, was often covered with a &s;heet of ice. We continued to &s;teer &s;outh-&s;outh-ea&s;t, almo&s;t in the direction of the coa&s;t, till five o'clock in the afternoon, when we &s;aw land bearing &s;outh 50&deg; ea&s;t, which proved to be a continuation of the coa&s;t. We hauled up for it without delay; and, at ten in the evening, being a-brea&s;t of the ea&s;tern land, and doubtful of weathering it, we tacked, and made a board towards the we&s;t, till after one o'clock the next morning, (Tue&s;day, the 1&s;t of September), when we again made &s;ail to the ea&s;t. The wind was now very un&s;ettled, continually varying from north to north-ea&s;t. Between eight and nine, the ea&s;tern extremity of the land was at the di&s;|tance
<PB N="56" REF="030274_0881_0FE573C002E852E0">
of &s;ix or &s;even miles, bearing &s;outh by ea&s;t. A head-land appeared, at the &s;ame time, bearing ea&s;t by &s;outh, half &s;outh; and, not long after, we could di&s;cern the whole coa&s;t that lay be|tween them, and a little i&s;land at &s;ome di&s;tance from it.</P>
<P>The coa&s;t now in &s;ight &s;eemed to form &s;everal rocky points, that were connected by a low &s;hore, without any appearance of an harbour. At a di&s;|tance from the &s;ea many hills pre&s;ented them|&s;elves to our view, the highe&s;t of which were in|volved in &s;now; in other re&s;pects, the whole country had a naked a&s;pect. At &s;even o'clock in the evening, two points of land, beyond the ea&s;tern head, opened off it in the direction of &s;outh 37&deg; ea&s;t.</P>
<P>Captain Cook was now convinced of what he had before imagined, that this was the country of the T&s;chut&s;ki, or the north-ea&s;tern coa&s;t of A&s;ia; and that Beering had proceeded thus far in the year 1728; that is, to this head, which, ac|cording to Muller, is denominated <HI>Serdze Kamen,</HI> on account of a rock upon it, that is of the figure of a heart. There are, indeed, many high rocks on this cape, &s;ome one or other of which may perhaps be &s;haped like a heart. It is a promontory of tolerable height, with a &s;teep rocky cliff front|ing the &s;ea. Its latitude is 67&deg; 3&prime; north, and its longitude 188&deg; 11&prime; ea&s;t. To the ea&s;t of it the coa&s;t is elevated and cold; but, to the we&s;t, it
<PB N="57" REF="030274_0882_0FE5731D82420C78">
is low, and extends north we&s;t by we&s;t, and north-north-we&s;t; and it is nearly of the &s;ame direction all the way to Cape North. The depth of water is every where the &s;ame at an equal di&s;|tance from the &s;hore; and this is likewi&s;e the ca&s;e on the oppo&s;ite coa&s;t of America. The greate&s;t depth we met with, as we ranged along it, was twenty-three fathoms. During the night, or in thick foggy weather, the &s;oundings are no bad guide to tho&s;e who &s;ail along either of the&s;e coa&s;ts.</P>
<P>On the 2d of September, at eight in the morn|ing, the mo&s;t advanced land to the &s;outh-ea&s;t|ward, bore &s;outh 25&deg; ea&s;t; and, from this par|ticular point of view, had an in&s;ular appearance. But the thick &s;howers of &s;now, that fell in quick &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, and &s;ettled on the land, concealed, from our &s;ight, at this time, a great part of the coa&s;t. In a &s;hort time after, the &s;un, which we had not &s;een for near five days, broke out dur|ing the intervals between the &s;howers, by which means the coa&s;t was, in &s;ome degree, freed from the fog; &s;o that we obtained a &s;ight of it, and found that the whole was connected. The wind was &s;till northerly, the air was cold, and the mer|cury in the thermometer did not ri&s;e above 35&deg;, and was &s;ometimes not higher than 30&deg;. At twelve o'clock our latitude was 66&deg; 37&prime; north; Cape Serdze Kamen was twelve or thirteen leagues di&s;tant, bearing north 52&deg; we&s;t; the mo&s;t &s;outh|erly
<PB N="58" REF="030274_0883_0FE573C1891D6B78">
point of land that we had in our &s;ight, bore &s;outh 41&deg; ea&s;t; our &s;oundings were twenty-two fathoms; and the di&s;tance of the neare&s;t part of the &s;hore was about two leagues.</P>
<P>The weather was now fair and bright; and, as we were ranging along the coa&s;t, we &s;aw &s;everal of the natives, and &s;ome of their dwelling-places, which had the appearance of hillocks of earth. In the cour&s;e of the evening we pa&s;&s;ed the Ea&s;tern Cape, or the point before-mentioned; from which the coa&s;t trends to the &s;outh-we&s;tward. This is the &s;ame point of land that we had pa&s;&s;ed on the 11th of the preceding month. Tho&s;e who gave credit to Mr. Staehlin's map, then &s;uppo&s;ed it to be the ea&s;tern point of his i&s;land Ala&s;chka; but we were, by this time, convinced, that it is no other than the ea&s;tern promontory of A&s;ia; and, perhaps, it is the proper T&s;chukot&s;koi No&s;s, though the promontory, which received that name from Beering, is &s;ituated further towards the &s;outh-we&s;t.</P>
<P>Muller, in his map of the di&s;coveries of the Ru&s;&s;ians, places the T&s;chukot&s;koi No&s;s nearly in the latitude of 75&deg; north, and extends it &s;ome|what to the ea&s;tward of this cape. But Captain Cook was of opinion, that he had no good authority for &s;o doing. Indeed his own, or rather De&s;hneff's account of the di&s;tance between the river Anadir and the No&s;s, cannot well be recon|ciled with &s;o northerly a po&s;ition. For he &s;ays,
<PB N="59" REF="030274_0884_0FE573C36A562668">
that, with the mo&s;t favourable wind a per&s;on may go by &s;ea from the No&s;s to the river Anadir in three whole days, and that the journey by land is very little longer. But Captain Cook, having hopes of vi&s;iting the&s;e parts again, deferred the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of this point to another opportunity. In the mean time, however, he concluded, as Beering had done before him, that this was the ea&s;ternmo&s;t point of all A&s;ia. It is a penin&s;ula of con&s;iderable elevation, joined to the continent by a very low and apparently narrow i&s;thmus. It has, next the &s;ea, a &s;teep rocky cliff; and off the very point are &s;everal rocks re&s;embling &s;pires. It &s;tands in the longitude of 190&deg; 22&prime; ea&s;t, and in the latitude of 66&deg; 6&prime; north; and is thirteen leagues di&s;tant, in the direction of north 53&deg; we&s;t, from Cape Prince of Wales, on the coa&s;t of America. The land about this promontory con|&s;i&s;ts of vallies and hills. The former terminate at the &s;ea in low &s;hores, and the latter in &s;teep rocky points. The hills appeared like naked rocks; but the vallies, though de&s;titute of tree or &s;hrub, were of a greeni&s;h hue.</P>
<P>After we had pa&s;&s;ed the Cape, we &s;teered &s;outh-we&s;t half we&s;t towards the northern point of St. Lawrence's Bay, in which our &s;hips had anchor|ed on the 10th of Augu&s;t. We reached it by eight o'clock the following morning, and &s;aw &s;ome of the natives at the place where we had be|fore &s;een them, as well as others on the oppo&s;ite
<PB N="60" REF="030274_0885_0FE573C858913AF8">
&s;ide of the bay, Not one of them, however, came off to us; which was rather remarkable, as the weather was &s;ufficiently favourable, and as tho&s;e whom we had lately vi&s;ited had no rea&s;on to be di&s;plea&s;ed with us. The&s;e people are cer|tainly the T&s;chut&s;ki, whom the Ru&s;&s;ians had not hitherto &s;ubdued; though it is manife&s;t that they mu&s;t carry on a traffic with the latter, either directly, or by the interpo&s;ition of &s;ome neigh|bouring nation; as their being in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;pontoons we &s;aw among them, cannot other|wi&s;e be accounted for.</P>
<P>The Bay of St. Lawrence <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Captain Cook called it by this name&punc; from his having anchored in it on the 10th of Augu&s;t, which is St. Lawrence's Day. It is worthy of remark, that Beering &s;ailed by this very place on Augu&s;t 10, 1728; for which rea&s;on, he denominated the neighbouring i&s;lands after the &s;ame &s;aint.</NOTE> is, at the entrance, at lea&s;t five leagues in breadth, and about four leagues deep, growing narrower towards the bot|tom, where it &s;eemed to be pretty well &s;heltered from the &s;ea winds, provided there is a com|petent depth of water for &s;hips. The Commodore did not wait to examine it, though he was ex|tremely de&s;irous of finding a convenient harbour in tho&s;e parts, to which he might re&s;ort in the &s;ucceeding &s;pring. But he wi&s;hed to meet with one where wood might be obtained; and he knew that none could be found here. From the &s;outhern point of this bay, which is &s;ituated in
<PB N="61" REF="030274_0886_0FE573CB5282A9A8">
the latitude of 65&deg; 30&prime; north, the coa&s;t trends we&s;t by &s;outh for the &s;pace of about nine leagues, and there &s;eems to form a deep bay or river; or el&s;e the land in that part is &s;o low that we could not di&s;cern it.</P>
<P>In the afternoon, about one o'clock, we &s;aw what was fir&s;t &s;uppo&s;ed to be a rock; but it was found to be a dead whale, which &s;ome A&s;iatics had killed, and were then towing a&s;hore. They &s;eemed to endeavour to conceal them&s;elves be|hind the fi&s;h, in order to avoid being &s;een by us. This, however, was unnece&s;&s;ary, for we pro|ceeded on our cour&s;e without taking notice of them. On the 4th, at break of day, we hauled to the north-we&s;tward, for the purpo&s;e of gaining a nearer view of the inlet &s;een the day before; but the wind, not long after, veering to that direction, the de&s;ign was abandoned; and, &s;teer|ing towards the &s;outh along the coa&s;t, we pa&s;&s;ed two bays, each about &s;ix miles deep. The mo&s;t northerly one is &s;ituate before a hill, which is rounder than any other we had ob&s;erved upon the coa&s;t. There is an i&s;land lying before the other bay. It is a matter of doubt whether there is a &s;ufficient depth of water for &s;hips in either of the&s;e bays, as, when we edged in for the &s;hore, we con&s;tantly met with &s;hoal water. This part of the country is extremely naked and hilly. In &s;everal places on the lower grounds, next the &s;ea, were the habitations of the natives, near all of
<PB N="62" REF="030274_0887_0FE573CCDA86FC30">
which were erected &s;tages of bones, like tho&s;e before-mentioned. This day, at noon, our lati|tude was 64&deg; 38&prime; north, and our longitude 188&deg; 15&prime; ea&s;t; the neare&s;t part of the &s;hore was at the di&s;tance of three or four leagues; and the mo&s;t &s;outhern point of the continent in &s;ight bore &s;outh 48&deg; we&s;t.</P>
<P>The wind, by this time, had veered to the north, and blew a light breeze: the weather was clear, and the air &s;harp. The Commodore did not think proper to follow the direction of the coa&s;t, as he perceived that it inclined we&s;tward towards the gulph of Anadir, into which he had no motive for going. He therefore &s;teered a &s;outherly cour&s;e, that he might have a &s;ight of the i&s;le of St. Lawrence, which had been di&s;|covered by Beering. This i&s;land was quickly &s;een by us; and, at eight in the evening, it bore &s;outh 20&deg; ea&s;t, &s;uppo&s;ed to be at the di&s;tance of eleven leagues. The mo&s;t &s;outherly point of the main land was, at that time, twelve leagues di&s;|tant, bearing &s;outh 83&deg; we&s;t. Captain Cook con|jectured, that this was the point which is called by Beering the ea&s;tern point of Suchot&s;ki, or Cape T&s;chukot&s;ki; an appellation which he gave it with &s;ome propriety, becau&s;e the natives, who &s;aid they were of the nation of the T&s;chut|&s;ki, came off to him from this part of the coa&s;t. Its latitude is 64&deg; 13&prime; north, and its longitude 185&deg; 36&prime; ea&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="030274_0888_0FE573CEC6A98160">The more the Captain was convinced of his being at pre&s;ent upon the A&s;iatic coa&s;t, the more he was at a lo&s;s to reconcile his ob&s;ervations with Mr. Staehlin's map of the New Northern Archi|pelago; and he could find no other method of accounting for &s;o important a difference, than by &s;uppo&s;ing that he had mi&s;taken &s;ome part of what Mr. Staehlin denominates the i&s;land of Ala&s;chka for the continent of America, and had mi&s;&s;ed the channel by which they are &s;eparated. But even on that &s;uppo&s;ition there would &s;till have been a con&s;iderable variation. The Captain con&s;idered it as an affair of &s;ome con&s;equence to clear up this point during the pre&s;ent &s;ea&s;on, that he might have only one object in view in the following one. And as the&s;e northerly i&s;lands were &s;aid to abound with wood, he had &s;ome hopes, if he &s;hould find them, of procuring a competent &s;upply of that article, of which we began to &s;tand in great need. With this view he &s;teered over for the coa&s;t of America; and the next day, about five o'clock in the afternoon, land was &s;een bearing &s;outh three quarters ea&s;t, which we imagined was An|der&s;on's I&s;land, or &s;ome other land near it. On Sunday the 6th, at four in the morning, we had a &s;ight of the American coa&s;t, near Sledge I&s;land; and, at &s;ix in the evening of the &s;ame day, that i&s;land was at the di&s;tance of about ten leagues, bearing north 6&deg; ea&s;t, and the mo&s;t ea&s;terly land in view bore north 49&deg; ea&s;t. If any part of what
<PB N="64" REF="030274_0889_0FE573D4D5A62CE0">
Captain Cook had conjectured to be the coa&s;t of the American continent, could po&s;&s;ibly be the i&s;land of Ala&s;chka, it was that now in &s;ight; in which ca&s;e he mu&s;t have mi&s;&s;ed the channel be|tween it and the main land, by &s;teering towards the we&s;t, in&s;tead of the ea&s;t, after he had fir&s;t fallen in with it. He was, therefore, at no lo&s;s where to go, for the purpo&s;e of clearing up the&s;e doubts.</P>
<P>On the 7th, at eight o'clock in the evening, we had made a near approach to the land. Sledge I&s;land bore north 85&deg; we&s;t, about eight leagues di&s;tant; and the ea&s;tern part of the coa&s;t bore north 70&deg; ea&s;t, with elevated land in the direction of ea&s;t by north. At this time we perceived a light on &s;hore; and two canoes, with people in them, came off towards us. We brought to, in order to give them time to approach; but they re&s;i&s;ted all our tokens of amity, and kept at the di&s;tance of a quarter of a mile&punc; We therefore left them, and proceeded along the coa&s;t. The next morn|ing, at one o'clock, ob&s;erving that the water &s;hoaled pretty fa&s;t, we anchored in ten fathoms, and remained in that &s;ituation till day-light came on. We then weighed, and pur&s;ued our cour&s;e along the coa&s;t, which trended ea&s;t, and ea&s;t half &s;outh. At &s;even o'clock in the evening we were abrea&s;t of a point, &s;ituated in the longitude of 197&deg; ea&s;t, and in the latitude of 64&deg; 21&prime; north; beyond which the coa&s;t a&s;&s;umes a more northerly
<PB N="65" REF="030274_0890_0FE573D67273D908">
direction. At eight this point, which received the appellation of Cape Darby, bore &s;outh 62&deg; we&s;t; the mo&s;t northern land we had in view, bore north 32&deg; ea&s;t; and the di&s;tance of the near|e&s;t part of the &s;hore was one league. In this &s;ituation we let go our anchors in thirteen fathoms, over a muddy bottom.</P>
<P>On the 9th, at break of day, we weighed and made &s;ail along the coa&s;t. We now &s;aw land, which we &s;uppo&s;ed to be two i&s;lands; the one bearing ea&s;t, the other &s;outh 70&deg; ea&s;t. Not long afterwards, we found our&s;evles near a coa&s;t cover|ed with wood; a plea&s;ing &s;ight to which we had not been lately accu&s;tomed. As we advanced northward, land was &s;een in the direction of north-ea&s;t, half north, which proved a continua|tion of the coa&s;t upon which we now were: we likewi&s;e perceived high land over the i&s;lands, ap|parently, at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance beyond them. This was imagined to be the continent, and the other land the i&s;le of Ala&s;chka; but it was already a matter of doubt, whether we &s;hould di&s;cover a pa&s;&s;age between them, for the water gradually &s;hoaled, as we proceeded further towards the north. In con&s;equence of this, two boats were di&s;patched a-head to &s;ound: and the Commodore ordered the Di&s;covery, as &s;he drew the lea&s;t wa|ter, to lead, keeping nearly in the middle chan|nel, between the coa&s;t and the mo&s;t northerly i&s;land. In this manner we continued our cour&s;e
<PB N="66" REF="030274_0891_0FE573D7F82B5560">
till three o'clock in the afternoon, when having pa&s;&s;ed the i&s;land, our &s;oundings did not exceed three fathoms and a half, and the Re&s;olution once brought up the mud from the bottom. In no part of the channel could a greater depth of wa|ter be found, though we had &s;ounded it from one &s;ide to the other; we therefore deemed it high time to return.</P>
<P>At this time, a head-land on the we&s;tern &s;hore, to which the name of Bald-head was given, was about one league di&s;tant, bearing north by we&s;t. The coa&s;t extended beyond it as far as north-ea&s;t by north, where it appeared to terminate in a point; behind which, the coa&s;t of the high land, that was &s;een over the i&s;lands, &s;tretched it&s;elf. The &s;hore on the we&s;tern &s;ide of Bald-head, forms a bay, in the bottom of which is a beach, where we perceived many huts of the natives.</P>
<P>We continued to ply back during the whole night; and, by day-break on the 10th, had deep|ened our water &s;ix fathoms. At nine o'clock, when we were about three miles from the we&s;t &s;hore, Captain Cook, accompanied by Mr. King, went with two boats in &s;earch of wood and wa|ter. They landed in that part where the coa&s;t projects into a bluff head compo&s;ed of perpen|dicular <HI>&s;trata</HI> of a dark blue rock, intermixed with glimmer and quartz. Adjoining to the beach is a narrow border of land, which was at this time covered with long gra&s;s, and where they
<PB N="67" REF="030274_0892_0FE573D9D6E6A7D8">
ob&s;erved &s;ome angelica. The ground, beyond this, ri&s;es with &s;ome abruptne&s;s: towards the top of this elevation, they found a heath, that abounded with berries of various kinds: further onwards the country was rather level, and thinly covered with &s;mall &s;pruce-trees, birch, and willows. They &s;aw the tracts of foxes and deer upon the beach; in many parts of which, there was a great abun|dance of drift-wood: there was al&s;o no want of fre&s;h-water.</P>
<P>Our gentlemen and their attendants having re|turned on board, the Commodore had thoughts of bringing the &s;hips to an anchor here; but the wind then &s;hifting to north-ea&s;t, and blowing ra|ther on this &s;hore, he &s;tretched over to the oppo|&s;ite one, expecting to find wood there likewi&s;e. At eight in the evening, we anchored near the &s;outhern end of the mo&s;t northerly i&s;land, for &s;uch we then imagined it to be. The next morning, however, we found that it was a penin&s;ula, con|nected with the continent by a low i&s;thmus, on each &s;ide of which, a bay is formed by the coa&s;t. We plied into the &s;outhernmo&s;t of the&s;e bays, and ca&s;t anchor again, about twelve o'clock, in five fathoms water, over a muddy bottom; the point of the penin&s;ula, to which the appellation of Cape Denbigh was given, being one league di&s;tance, in the direction of north 68&deg; we&s;t.</P>
<P>We ob&s;erved on the penin&s;ula, &s;everal of the na|tives; and one of them came off in a &s;mall canoe.
<PB N="68" REF="030274_0893_0FE573DE30122318">
Captain Cook gave this man a knife and &s;ome beads, with which he appeared to be well plea&s;ed; we made &s;igns to him to bring us &s;ome provi&s;ion, upon which he in&s;tantly quited us, and paddled <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">owards the &s;hore. Happening to meet another man coming off, who had two dried &s;almons, he got them from him; and when he returned to our &s;hip, he refu&s;ed to give them to any body except Captain Cook. Some of our people fan|cied, that he a&s;ked for him under the name of <HI>Capitaine</HI>; but, in this, they were perhaps mi&s;|taken. Others of the inhabitants came off &s;oon afterwards, and gave us a few dried fi&s;h, in ex|change for &s;uch trifles as we had to barter with them. They &s;hewed no di&s;like for tobacco, but they were mo&s;t de&s;irous of knives.</P>
<P>In the afternoon, Mr. Gore was di&s;patched to the penin&s;ula, to procure wood and water; of the former of which articles, we ob&s;erved great plenty upon the beach. At the &s;ame time, a boat from each of the &s;hips was &s;ent to &s;ound round the bay, and at three o'clock, the wind fre&s;hening at north-ea&s;t, we weighed anchor and endeavoured to work further in. But that was quickly found to be impracticable, by rea&s;on of the &s;hoals, which extended entirely round the bay, to the di&s;tance of upwards of two miles from the &s;hore; as the officers, who had been &s;ent out for the purpo&s;e of &s;ounding, reported. We therefore &s;tood off and on with the &s;hips, waiting
<PB N="69" REF="030274_0894_0FE573E0160C4D68">
for Lieutenant Go<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">, who returned about eight o'clock in the evening, with the launch loaded with wood. He informed the Commodore, that he had found but little fre&s;h water, and that the wood could not be procured without difficulty on account of the boats grounding at &s;ome di&s;|tance from the beach. As this was the ca&s;e we &s;tood back to the other &s;hore; and the next morn|ing, at eight, all the boats, and a detachment of men, with an officer, were &s;ent to get wood from the place where Captain Cook had landed on the 10th.</P>
<P>After having continued, for &s;ome time, to &s;tand off and on with the &s;hips, we at length ca&s;t an|chor in le&s;s than five fathoms, at the di&s;tance of half a league from the coa&s;t, who&s;e &s;outhern point bore &s;outh 26&deg; we&s;t. Cape Denbigh was about twenty-&s;ix miles di&s;tant, bearing &s;outh 72&deg; ea&s;t; Bald-head was nine leagues off, in the direction of north 60&deg; ea&s;t; and the i&s;land near the ea&s;tern &s;hore, &s;outh of Cape Denbigh, named by Cap|tain Cook, Be&s;borough I&s;land, was fifteen leagues di&s;tant, bearing &s;outh 52&deg; ea&s;t</P>
<P>This being a very open road, and therefore not a &s;ecure &s;tation for the &s;hips, the Commodore re&s;olved not to wait till our &s;tock of water was completed, as that would take up &s;ome time; but only to furni&s;h both &s;hips with wood, and afterwards to &s;eek a more commodious place for the former article. Our people carried off the
<PB N="70" REF="030274_0895_0FE548C86B751B58">
drift-wood that lay on the beach, and performed that bu&s;ine&s;s with great expedition; for, as the wind blew along the &s;hore, the boats were ena|bled to &s;ail both ways. In the afternoon Captain Cook went on &s;hore, and took a walk into the country; which, in tho&s;e parts where there was no wood, abounded with heath, and other plants, &s;everal of which had plenty of berries, all ripe. Scarce a &s;ingle plant was in flower. The under|wood, &s;uch as birch, alders, and willows, occa|&s;ioned walking to be very trouble&s;ome among the trees, which were all &s;pruce, and none of which exceeded &s;even or eight inches in diameter; but &s;ome were ob&s;erved lying on the beach, that were above twice that &s;ize. All the drift-wood that we &s;aw in the&s;e northern parts was fir.</P>
<P>The following day, which was Sunday the 13th, a family of the natives came near the &s;pot where our people were occupied in taking of wood. The Captain &s;aw only the hu&s;band and wife, and their child, be&s;ides a fourth per&s;on, who was the mo&s;t deformed cripple he had ever &s;een. The hu&s;band was nearly blind, and neither he, nor his wife, were &s;uch well looking people as many of tho&s;e whom we had met with on this coa&s;t. Both of them had their lower lips perforated; and they were in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;ome gla&s;s-beads, re&s;embling tho&s;e we had &s;een before among their neighbours. Iron was the article that plea&s;ed them mo&s;t. For four knives which had been
<PB N="71" REF="030274_0896_0FE573E391B9AC88">
formed out of an old iron hoop, the Captain ob|tained from them near four hundred pounds weight of fi&s;h, that had been lately caught by them. Some of the&s;e were trout, and others were, with re&s;pect to &s;ize and ta&s;te, &s;omewhat be|tween a herring and a mullet. The Captain gave a few beads to the child, who was a female; upon which the mother immediately bur&s;t into tears, then the father, next after him the cripple, and at la&s;t, to add the fini&s;hing &s;troke to the con|cert, the child her&s;elf. This mu&s;ic, however, was not of long duration.</P>
<P>Mr. King had, on the preceding day, been in company with the &s;ame family. His account of this interview is to the following purport: While he attended the wooding party, a canoe, filled with natives, approached, out of which an elderly man and woman (the hu&s;band and wife above mentioned) came a&s;hore. Mr. King pre|&s;ented a &s;mall knife to the woman, and promi&s;ed to give her a much larger one in exchange for &s;ome fi&s;h. She made &s;igns to him to follow her. After he had proceeded with them about a mile, the man fell down as he was cro&s;&s;ing a &s;tony beach, and happened to cut his foot very much. This occa&s;ioned Mr. King to &s;top; upon which the woman pointed to her hu&s;band's eyes, which were covered with a thick, whiti&s;h film. He af|terwards kept clo&s;e to his wife, who took care to apprize him of the ob&s;tacles in his way. The
<PB N="72" REF="030274_0897_0FE573E806EFF870">
woman had a child on her back, wrapped up in the hood of her jacket. After walking about two miles, they arrived at an open &s;kin-boat, which was turned on one &s;ide, the convex part towards the wind, and was made to &s;erve for the habitation of this family. Mr. King now per|formed a remarkable operation on the man's eyes. He was fir&s;t de&s;ired to hold his breath, then to breathe on the di&s;tempered eyes, and afterwards to &s;pit on them. The woman then took both the hands of Mr. King, and pre&s;&s;ing them to the man's &s;tomach, held them there for &s;ome time, while &s;he recounted &s;ome melancholy hi&s;tory re|&s;pecting her family; &s;ometimes pointing to her hu&s;band, &s;ometimes to her child, and at other times to the cripple, who was related to her. Mr. King purcha&s;ed all the fi&s;h they had, which con&s;i&s;ted of excellent &s;almon, &s;almon-trout, and mullet. The&s;e fi&s;h were faithfully delivered to the per&s;on he &s;ent for them.</P>
<P>The woman was &s;hort and &s;quat, and her vi&s;age was plump and round. She wore a jacket made of deer &s;kin, with a large hood, and had on a pair of wide boots. She was punctured from the lip to the chin. Her hu&s;band was well made, and about five feet two inches in height. His hair was black and &s;hort and he had but little beard. His complexion was of a light copper ca&s;t. He had two holes in his lower lip, in which, however, he had no ornaments. The
<PB N="73" REF="030274_0898_0FE573E98D7E73D8">
teeth of both of them were black, and appeared as if they had been filed down level with the gums.</P>
<P>Before night, on the 13th, we had amply fur|ni&s;hed the &s;hips with wood, and had conveyed on board about a dozen ton of water to each. On the 14th a party was detached on &s;hore to cut brooms, and likewi&s;e the branches of &s;pruce-trees for brewing beer. About twelve o'clock all our people were taken on board, for the wind fre&s;hen|ing had rai&s;ed &s;o heavy a &s;urf on the beach, that our boats could not continue to land without extreme difficulty and danger.</P>
<P>As doubts were &s;till entertained whether the coa&s;t, upon which we now were, belonged to an i&s;land, or to the continent of America, lieute|nant King was di&s;patched by the Commodore, with two boats, well manned and armed, to make &s;uch &s;earch as might tend to remove all differ|ence of opinion on the &s;ubject. He was in|&s;tructed to proceed towards the north as far as the extreme point &s;een on Wedne&s;day the 9th, or a little further, if he &s;hould find it nece&s;&s;ary; to land there, and, from the heights, endeavour to di&s;cover whether the land he was then upon, imagined to be the i&s;land of Ala&s;chka, was really an i&s;land, or was connected with the land to the ea&s;tward, &s;uppo&s;ed to be the American conti|nent. If it proved to be an i&s;land, he was to examine the depth of water in the channel be|tween
<PB N="74" REF="030274_0899_0FE573EB725548D0">
it and the continent, and which way the flood-tide came: but if he &s;hould find the two lands united, he was to return immediately to the &s;hip. He was directed not to be ab&s;ent longer than four or five days; and it was al&s;o mentioned in his in&s;tructions, that, if any unfore&s;een or un|avoidable accident &s;hould force our &s;hips off the coa&s;t, the rendezvous was to be at the harbour of Samganoodha.</P>
<P>On Tue&s;day the 15th, the &s;hips removed over to the bay on the &s;outh-ea&s;tern &s;ide of Cape Den|bigh, where we ca&s;t anchor in the afternoon. Not long after, &s;everal of the inhabitants came off in canoes, and gave us &s;ome <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;almon in exchange for trifling articles. Early the next morning, nine men, each in a &s;eparate canoe, paid us a vi&s;it, with the &s;ole view of gratifying their curio&s;ity. They approached the &s;hip with caution, and drawing up abrea&s;t of each other, under our &s;tern, favoured us with a &s;ong; while one of their number made many ludicrous mo|tions with his hands and body, and another beat upon a &s;ort of drum. There was nothing &s;avage, either in the &s;ong, or the ge&s;tures with which it was accompanied. There &s;eemed to be no dif|ference, either with re&s;pect to &s;ize or features, between the&s;e people, and tho&s;e whom we had &s;een on every other part of the coa&s;t, except King George's Sound. Their dre&s;s, which chiefly con&s;i&s;ted of the &s;kins of deer, was made after
<PB N="75" REF="030274_0900_0FE573ED56031220">
the &s;ame mode; and they had adopted the practice of perforating their lower lips, and affixing orna|ments to them.</P>
<P>The habitations of the&s;e Americans were &s;itu|ated clo&s;e to the beach. They con&s;i&s;t merely of a &s;loping roof, without any &s;ide walls, form|ed of logs, and covered with earth and gra&s;s. The floor is likewi&s;e laid with logs. The entrance is at one end, and the fire-place is ju&s;t within it. A &s;mall hole is made near the door of the hut, for the purpo&s;e of letting out the &s;moke.</P>
<P>A party of men was di&s;patched, this morning, to the penin&s;ula for brooms and &s;pruce. Half the re|mainder of the people of both &s;hips were, at the &s;ame time, permitted to go a&s;hore and gather ber|ries. The&s;e returned on board about twelve o'clock and the other half then landed for the &s;ame purpo&s;e. The berries found here were hurtle-ber|ries, heath-berries, partridge-berries, and wild cur|rant-berries. Captain Cook al&s;o went a&s;hore him|&s;elf, and took a walk over part of the penin&s;ula. He met with very good gra&s;s in &s;everal places, and &s;carcely ob&s;erved a &s;ingle &s;pot on which &s;ome vegetable was not growing. The low land by which this penin&s;ula is united to the continent, abounds with narrow creeks, and likewi&s;e with ponds of water, &s;everal of which were at this time frozen over. There were numbers of bu&s;tards and gee&s;e, but they were &s;o &s;hy, that it was impo&s;|&s;ible to get within mu&s;quet-&s;hot of them. Some
<PB N="76" REF="030274_0901_0FE573F3979932E0">
&s;nipes were al&s;o &s;een; and on the higher grounds, were partridges of two &s;pecies; where there was wood, mu&s;quitoes were numerous. Some of the officers, who went further into the country than Captain Cook did, met with &s;ome of the natives of both &s;exes, who treated them with civility and kindne&s;s.</P>
<P>The Commodore was of opinion, that this pe|nin&s;ula had been an i&s;land in &s;ome di&s;tant period; for there were marks of the &s;ea having formerly flowed over the i&s;thmus; and even at pre&s;ent, it appeared to be kept out by a bank of &s;and &s;tones, and wood which the waves had thrown up: It was manife&s;t from this bank, that the land here encroached upon the &s;ea, and it was not difficult to trace its gradual formation.</P>
<P>Lieutenant King returned from his expedition about &s;even o'clock this evening. He had &s;et out at eight o'clock at night, on the 14th. The crews of the boats rowed without intermi&s;&s;ion towards the land, till one in the morning of the 15th. They then &s;et their &s;ails, and &s;tood acro&s;s the bay, which the coa&s;t forms to the we&s;tward of Bald-Head. They afterwards, about three o'clock, again made u&s;e of their oars, and by two in the afternoon, had got within two miles of Bald-Head, under the lee of the high land. At that time all the men in the boat belonging to the Re&s;olution, except two, were &s;o oppre&s;&s;ed with fatigue and &s;leep, that Mr. King's utmo&s;t endea|vours
<PB N="77" REF="030274_0902_0FE573F5659CD478">
to make them put on were perfectly inef|fectual. They, at length, were &s;o far exhau&s;ted, as to drop their oars, and fall a&s;leep at the bot|tom of the boat. In con&s;equence of this, Mr King, and two gentlemen who were with him, were obliged to lay hold of the oars; and they landed, a little after three o'clock, between Bald-Head and a point that projects to the ea&s;tward.</P>
<P>Mr. King, upon his landing, a&s;cended the heights, from which he could &s;ee the two coa&s;ts join, and that the inlet terminated in a &s;mall creek or river, before which there were banks of &s;and or mud, and in every part &s;hoal water. The land, for &s;ome di&s;tance towards the north, was low and &s;wampy; then it ro&s;e in hills; and the perfect junction of tho&s;e, on each &s;ide of the inlet, was traced with|out the lea&s;t difficulty.</P>
<P>From the elevated &s;ituation in which Mr. King took his &s;urvey of the Sound, he could di&s;cern many &s;pacious vallies, with rivers flowing through them, well wooded, and bounded by hills of a moderate height. One of the rivers towards the north-we&s;t &s;eemed to be con&s;iderable; and he was inclined to &s;uppo&s;e, from its direction, that it di&s;charged it&s;elf into the &s;ea at the head of the bay. Some of his people, penetrating beyond this into the country, found the trees to be of a larger &s;ize the further they proceeded.</P>
<P>To this inlet Captain Cook gave the name of Norton's Sound, in honour of Sir Fletcher Nor|ton,
<PB N="78" REF="030274_0903_0FE573F6E9F754F8">
now Lard Grantley, a near relation of Mr. King. It extends northward as far as the latitude of 64&deg; 55&prime; north. The bay, wherein our &s;hips were now at anchor, is &s;ituated on the &s;outh-ea&s;tern &s;ide of it, and is denominated <HI>Chacktoole</HI> by the natives. It is not a very excellent &s;tation, being expo&s;ed to the &s;outh and &s;outh-we&s;t winds. Nor is a harbour to be met with in all this Sound. We were &s;o fortunate, however, as to have the wind from the north-ea&s;t and the north, during the whole time of our continuance here, with very fine weather. This afforded an opportunity of making a great number of lunar ob&s;ervations, the mean re&s;ult of which gave 197&deg; 13&prime; ea&s;t, as the longitude of the anchoring-place on the we&s;|tern &s;ide of the Sound, while its latitude was 64&deg; 31&prime; north. With re&s;pect to the tides, the night-flood ro&s;e two or three feet, and the day flood was &s;carcely perceivable.</P>
<P>Captain Cook being now perfectly convinced, that Mr. Staehlin's map was extremely erroneous, and having re&s;tored the continent of America to the &s;pace which that gentleman had occupied with his imaginary i&s;land of Ala&s;chka, thought it now high time to quit the&s;e northerly regions, and retire to &s;ome place for the winter, where he might obtain provi&s;ions and refre&s;hments. He did not con&s;ider Petropaulow&s;ka, or the harbour of St. Peter and St. Paul in Kamt&s;chatka, as like|ly to furni&s;h a &s;ufficient &s;upply. He had like|wi&s;e
<PB N="79" REF="030274_0904_0FE573F8CB5B68E0">
other rea&s;ons for not going thither at pre|&s;ent; the principal of which was, his great un|willingne&s;s to remain inactive for &s;ix or &s;even months, which would have been the con&s;equence of pa&s;&s;ing the winter in any of the&s;e northern countries. He at length concluded, that no &s;itua|tion was &s;o convenient for our purpo&s;e as the Sandwich I&s;lands. To them, therefore, he form|ed a re&s;olution of repairing. But a &s;upply of water being nece&s;&s;ary before he could execute that de&s;ign, he determined, with a view of pro|curing this e&s;&s;ential article, to &s;earch the coa&s;t of America for a harbour, by proceeding along it to the &s;outhward. If he &s;hould not meet with &s;uc|ce&s;s in that &s;earch, his intention was to reach Samganoodha, which was appointed for our place of rendezvous, in ca&s;e the &s;hips &s;hould happen to &s;eparate.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>IN the morning of the 17th of September, we weighed anchor with a light ea&s;terly breeze, and &s;teered to the &s;outhward, attempted to pa&s;s within Be&s;bourough I&s;land; but, though it is &s;ix or &s;even miles di&s;tant from the continent, we were prevented, by meeting with &s;hoal water. Having but little wind all the day, we did not
<PB N="81" REF="030274_0906_0FE5740003B5C4A0">
pa&s;s that i&s;land before it was dark; and the night was &s;pent under an ea&s;y &s;ail.</P>
<P>At day-break, on the 18th, we re&s;umed our progre&s;s along the coa&s;t. At noon, our &s;ound|ings were no more than five fathoms. Be&s;bo|rough I&s;land, at this time, bore north 42&deg; ea&s;t; the mo&s;t &s;outherly land in &s;ight, which al&s;o prov|ed to be an i&s;land, bore &s;outh 66&deg; we&s;t; the pa&s;|&s;age between it and the continent, was in the di|rection of &s;outh 40&deg; we&s;t, and the neare&s;t land was at the di&s;tance of about two miles.</P>
<P>We continued to &s;teer for this pa&s;&s;age, till the boats which were a-head made the &s;ignal for hav|ing no more than three fathoms water. In con|&s;equence of this, we hauled without the i&s;land, and di&s;played the &s;ignal for the Re&s;olution's boat to keep between the &s;hore and the &s;hips.</P>
<P>This i&s;land, to which the name of Stuart's I&s;land was given, lies in the latitude of 63&deg; 35&prime; north, and is &s;eventeen leagues di&s;tant from Cape Denbigh, in the direction of &s;outh 27&deg; we&s;t. It is &s;ix or &s;even leagues in circumference. Though &s;ome parts of it are of a moderate height, yet, in general, it is low, with &s;ome rocks off the we&s;tern part. The greate&s;t part of the coa&s;t of the continent is low land, but we perceived high land up the country. It forms a point, op|po&s;ite the i&s;land, which was di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of Cape Stephens, and is &s;ituated in the latitude of 63&deg; 33&prime; north, and in the longitude of
<PB N="82" REF="030274_0907_0FE5740189DAE360">
197&deg; 41&prime; ea&s;t. Some drift wood was ob&s;erved on the &s;hores, both on the i&s;land and of the conti|nent; but not a &s;ingle tree was &s;een growing upon either. Ve&s;&s;els might anchor, upon occa&s;ion, between the continent and the north-ea&s;t &s;ide of this i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and in a depth of five fathoms, &s;heltered from the ea&s;terly, we&s;terly, and &s;outherly winds. But this &s;tation would be entirely expo&s;ed to the northerly winds, the land, in that direction, be|ing too remote to afford any &s;ecurity. Before we reached Stuart's I&s;land, we pa&s;&s;ed two little i&s;lands, &s;ituate between us and the main land; and as we ranged along the coa&s;t, &s;everal of the natives made their appearance upon the &s;hore, and by &s;igns, &s;eemed to invite us to approach.</P>
<P>We were no &s;ooner without the i&s;land, than we &s;teered &s;outh by we&s;t, for the mo&s;t &s;outhern part of the continent in &s;ight, till eight in the even|ing, when, the depth of water having decrea&s;ed from &s;ix fathoms to le&s;s than four, we tacked and &s;tood to the northward into five fathoms, and then pa&s;&s;ed the night in &s;tanding off and on. At the time we tacked, the &s;outhernmo&s;t point of land above-mentioned, which we named Point Shallow-Water, bore &s;outh half ea&s;t, at the di&s;|tance of &s;even leagues. On the 19th, at day-break, we re&s;umed our &s;outherly cour&s;e; but &s;hoal water &s;oon obliged us to haul more to the we&s;tward. We were at length &s;o far advanced upon the bank, that we could not hold a north-north-we&s;t
<PB N="83" REF="030274_0908_0FE574030E1E22C0">
cour&s;e, as we &s;ometimes met with only four fathoms. The wind blowing fre&s;h at ea&s;t-north-ea&s;t, it was now high time to endeavour to find a greater depth of water, and quit a coa&s;t upon which we would no longer navigate with &s;afety. We therefore hauled the wind to the northward, and the water gradually increa&s;ed in depth to eight fathoms.</P>
<P>At the time of our hauling the wind, we were about twelve leagues di&s;tant from the continent, and nine to the we&s;t of Stuart's I&s;land. We &s;aw no land to the &s;outhward of Point Shallow-Water, which Captain Cook judged to lie in the lati|tude of 63&deg; north; &s;o that between this latitude and Shoal Ne&s;s, in latitude 60&deg;, the coa&s;t has not been explored. It is probably acce&s;&s;ible only to boats, or very &s;mall ve&s;&s;els; or, if there are channels for ve&s;&s;els of greater magnitude, it would require &s;ome time to find them. From the ma&s;t-head, the &s;ea within us appeared to be checquered with &s;hoals; the water was very muddy and di&s;coloured, and much fre&s;her than at any of the places where our &s;hips had lately anchored. From this we inferred, that a con&s;i|derable river runs into the &s;ea, in this unexplored part.</P>
<P>After we had got into eight fathoms water, we &s;teered to the we&s;tward, and afterwards more &s;outherly, for the land di&s;covered by us on the 5th of September, which at noon on the 20th,
<PB N="84" REF="030274_0909_0FE5740A4E15ED30">
bore &s;outh-we&s;t by we&s;t, at the di&s;tance of ten or eleven leagues. We had now a fre&s;h gale at north, and, at intervals, &s;howers of hail and &s;now, with a pretty high &s;ea. To the land before us, the commodore gave the appellation of Clerke's I&s;land. It &s;tands in the latitude of 63&deg; 15&prime;, and in the longitude of 190&deg; 30&prime;. It &s;eemed to be an i&s;land of con&s;iderable extent, in which are &s;eve|ral hills, all connected by low ground, &s;o that it looks, at a di&s;tance, like a group of I&s;lands. Near its ea&s;tern part is a little i&s;land, which is re|markable for having on it three elevated rocks. Both the greater i&s;land, and this &s;maller one, were inhabited</P>
<P>About &s;ix o'clock in the afternoon, we reach|ed the northern point of Clerke's I&s;land; and having ranged along its coa&s;t till dark, we brought too, during the night. Early the next morning, we again &s;tood in for the coa&s;t, and proceeded along it in que&s;t of an harbour, till twelve o'clock, when finding no probability of &s;ucce&s;s, we left it and &s;teered &s;outh-&s;outh-we&s;t, for the land di&s;|covered by us on the 29th of July; having a fre&s;h gale at north, accompanied with &s;howers of &s;now and &s;leet.</P>
<P>On Wedne&s;day the 23d, at day-break, the land above-mentioned made its appearance, bear|ing &s;outh-we&s;t, at the di&s;tance of &s;ix or &s;even leagues. From this point of view it re&s;embled a clu&s;ter of i&s;lands; but it was found to be only
<PB N="85" REF="030274_0910_0FE5740BF29182C8">
one, of about thirty miles in extent, in the di|rection of north-we&s;t and &s;outh-ea&s;t; the &s;outh-ea&s;tern extremity being Cape Upright, which we have mentioned before. The i&s;land is nar|row, particularly at the low necks of land by which the hills are connected. Captain Cook afterwards found, that it was entirely unknown to the Ru&s;&s;ians, and, therefore, con&s;idering it as a di&s;covery of our own, he named it Gore's I&s;land. It appeared to be barren and de&s;titute of inha|bitants, at lea&s;t we &s;aw none. Nor did we ob|&s;erve &s;uch a number of birds about it, as we had &s;een when we fir&s;t di&s;covered it. But we per|ceived &s;ome &s;ea-otters, an animal which we had not found to the north of this latitude. About twe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e miles from Cape Upright, in the direction of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">uth 72&deg; we&s;t, &s;tands a &s;mall i&s;land, who&s;e lofty &s;ummit terminates in &s;everal pinnacle rocks, for which rea&s;on it obtained the name of the Pin|nacle I&s;land.</P>
<P>At two o'clock in the afternoon, after we had pa&s;&s;ed Cape Upright, we &s;teered &s;outh-ea&s;t by &s;outh, for Samganoodha, with a gentle breeze at north-north-we&s;t, being re&s;olved to lo&s;e no more time in &s;earching for an harbour among i&s;lands, which we now began to &s;u&s;pect had no exi&s;tence; at lea&s;t, not in the latitude and lon|gitude in which they have been placed by mo|dern delineators of charts. On the 24th, in the
<PB N="86" REF="030274_0911_0FE5747E6C7B3500">
evening, the wind veered to &s;outh-we&s;t and &s;outh, and increa&s;ed to a fre&s;h gale.</P>
<P>We continued our ea&s;terly cour&s;e till eight in the morning of the 25th, when in the longitude of 191&deg; 10&prime;, and in the latitude of 58&deg; 32&prime; we tacked and &s;tood to the we&s;tward; &s;oon after which, the gale increa&s;ing, we were reduced to two cour&s;es, and clo&s;e-reefed main-top-&s;ails. In a &s;hort time after, the Re&s;olution &s;prung a leak, under the &s;tarboard buttock, which was &s;o con&s;i|derable, as to keep one pump con&s;tantly employ|ed. We would not venture to put the &s;hip upon the other tack, from the apprehen&s;ion of getting upon the &s;hoals that lie to the north-we&s;t of Cape Newenham; but continued to &s;teer towards the we&s;t, till &s;ix in the evening of Saturday the 26th, when we wore and &s;tood to the ea&s;tward; and then the leak gave us no further trouble. This proved, that it was above the water-line, which gave us great &s;atisfaction. The gale had now cea&s;ed, but the wind continued at &s;outh, and &s;outh-we&s;t, for &s;ome days longer.</P>
<P>At length, on Friday the 2d of october, at day-break, we &s;aw the i&s;le of Oonala&s;hka, in a &s;outh-ea&s;t direction. But as the land was ob|&s;cured by a thick haze, we were not certain with re&s;pect to our &s;ituation till noon, when the ob|&s;erved latitude determined it. We hauled into a bay, ten miles to the we&s;tward of Samganood|ha, known by the appellation of Egooch&s;hac;
<PB N="87" REF="030274_0912_0FE57460453C3D90">
but finding very deep water, we &s;peedily left it. The natives vi&s;ited us at different times, bring|ing with them dried &s;almon, and other fi&s;h, which our &s;ailors received in exchange for to|bacco. Only a few days before, every ounce of tobacco that remained in the &s;hip, had been di&s;|tributed among them, and the quantity was not half &s;ufficient to an&s;wer their demands. Not|with&s;tanding this, &s;o thoughtle&s;s and improvi|dent a being is an Engli&s;h &s;ailor, that they were as profu&s;e in making their bargains, as if we had arrived at a port in Virginia; by which means, in le&s;s than two days, the value of this commo|dity was lowered above a thou&s;and <HI>per c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nt.</HI></P>
<P>The next day at one o'clock in the afternoon, we anchored in the harbour of Samganoodha, and, on the morning of the 4th, the carpenters were employed in ripping off the &s;heathing of and under the wale of the Re&s;olution on the &s;tar|board &s;ide. Many of the &s;eams were found en|tirly open; it was therefore not to be wondered at, that &s;o much water had got into the &s;hip. We cleared the fi&s;h and &s;pirit rooms, and the after-hold; and di&s;po&s;ed things in &s;uch a man|ner, that, in ca&s;e of any future leaks of the &s;ame nature the water might find its way to the pumps. Be&s;ides this work, and completing our &s;tock of water, we cleared the fore-hold, and took in a quantity of balla&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="030274_0913_0FE5747FF282A230">The vegetables we had met with when we were here before, were now, for the mo&s;t part, in a &s;tate of decay. There being great plenty of ber|ries, one third of the people, by turns, had per|mi&s;&s;ion to go a-&s;hore and gather them. Con&s;i|derable quantities of them were al&s;o brought to us by the inhabitants. If there were any &s;eeds of the &s;curvy, among the people of either &s;hip, the&s;e berries, and the u&s;e of &s;pruce beer, which the were allowed to drink every other day, effec|tually eradicated them.</P>
<P>We likewi&s;e procured abundance of fi&s;h, at fir&s;t, chiefly &s;almon, both fre&s;h and dried, which the natives brought us. Some of the fre&s;h &s;al|mon was in the highe&s;t perfection; but there was one &s;ort, which, from the figure of its head, we called hook-no&s;ed, that was but indifferent. Drawing the &s;eine &s;everal times, at the head of they bay, we caught many &s;almon trout, and a halibut that weighed two hundred and fifty-four pounds. We afterwards had recour&s;e to hooks and lines. A boat was &s;ent out every morning, which &s;eldom returned without eight or ten ha|libut, a quantity more than &s;ufficient to &s;erve all our people. The&s;e fi&s;h were excellent, and there were few who did not perfer them to &s;almon. Thus we not only obtained a &s;upply of fi&s;h for pre&s;ent con&s;umption, but had &s;ome to carry with us to &s;ea.</P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="030274_0914_0FE57481D3E74E70">Captain Cook received, on the 8th, by the hands of a native of Oonala&s;hka, named Derra|mou&s;hk, a very &s;ingular pre&s;ent, con&s;idering the place we were in. It was a rye loaf, or rather a pye in the form of a loaf, as it enclo&s;ed &s;ome &s;al|mon, well &s;ea&s;oned with pepper. This man had brought a &s;imilar pre&s;ent for Captain Clerke, and a note for each of the Captains, written in a character which none of us under&s;tood. It was natural to imagine, that the&s;e two pre&s;ents were from &s;ome Ru&s;&s;ians now in our neighbourhood, and therefore the Captains &s;ent, by the &s;ame me&s;|&s;enger, to the&s;e unknown friends, a few bottles of rum, wine and porter, which they &s;uppo&s;ed would be highly acceptable. Captain Cook al&s;o &s;ent, in company with Derramou&s;hk, Corporal Lediard, of the marines, an intelligent man, for the purpo&s;e of gaining farther information; with orders that if he met with any Ru&s;&s;ians, he &s;hould endeavour to make them under&s;tand, that we were Engli&s;hmen, the friends and allies of their nation.</P>
<P>On Saturday the 10th, Corporal Lediard re|turned with three Ru&s;&s;ian &s;eamen, or furriers, who, with &s;everal others, re&s;ided at Egooch&s;hac, where they had &s;ome &s;tore-hou&s;es, a dwelling hou&s;e, and a &s;loop of about thirty ton burthen. One of the&s;e Ru&s;&s;ians was either Ma&s;ter or Mate of this ve&s;&s;el. They were all three intelligent, well behaved men, and extremely ready to give
<PB N="90" REF="030274_0915_0FE57486AAE648D8">
us all the information we could de&s;ire. But, for want of an interpreter, we found it very difficult to under&s;tand each other. They appeared to have a perfect knowledge of the attempts which their countrymen had made to navigate the Frozen Ocean, and of the di&s;coveries that had been made from Kamt&s;chatka, by Beering, T&s;cherik off, and Spangenberg. But they had not the lea&s;t idea to what part of the world Mr. Staehlin's map re|ferred, when it was laid before them. When Captain Cook pointed out Kamt&s;chatka, and &s;ome other places, upon this map, they a&s;ked him whether he had &s;een the i&s;lands there repre|&s;ented; and, on his an&s;wering in the negative, one of them put his finger upon a part of the map, where a number of i&s;lands are laid down, and &s;aid, that he had crui&s;ed there in &s;earch of land, but could not meet with any. The Cap|tain then &s;hewed them his own chart, and found that they were &s;trangers to every part of the coa&s;t of America, except that which lies oppo&s;ite this i&s;land.</P>
<P>One of the&s;e men &s;aid, that he had been with Beering in his American voyage; but he mu&s;t then have been very young; for even now, at the di&s;tance of thirty-&s;even years, he had not the appearance of being aged. Never was greater re&s;pect paid to the memory of any eminent per|&s;on, than by the&s;e men to that of Beering. The trade in which they are engaged, is very advan|tageous,
<PB N="91" REF="030274_0916_0FE5748832E046D8">
and its being undertaken and extended to the ea&s;tward of Kamt&s;chatka, was the imme|diate re&s;ult of the &s;econd voyage of that di&s;tin|gui&s;hed navigator, who&s;e misfortunes proved the &s;ource of much private benefit to individuals, and of public utility to the Ru&s;&s;ian empire. And yet, if his di&s;tre&s;&s;es had not accidentally carried him to the i&s;land which bears his name, where he ended his life, and from whence the remainder of his &s;hip's crew brought back &s;pecimens of its valuable furs, the Ru&s;&s;ians would probably have undertaken no future voyages, which could lead them to make di&s;coveries in this &s;ea, towards the American coa&s;t. Indeed, after his time, their mini&s;try &s;eem to have paid le&s;s attention to this object; and, for what di&s;coveries have been &s;ince made, we are principally indebted to the enter|prizing &s;pirit of private merchants, encouraged, however, by the &s;uperintending care of the court of Peter&s;burgh.</P>
<P>The three Ru&s;&s;ians having remained all night with the Commodore, vi&s;ited Captain Clerke the following morning, and then departed, perfectly &s;atisfied with the reception they had met with. They promi&s;ed to return in a few days, and bring with them a chart of the i&s;lands &s;ituate between Kamt&s;chatka and Oonala&s;hka.</P>
<P>In the evening of the 14th, while Captain Cook and Mr. Webber were at a village, not far from Samganoodha, a Ru&s;&s;ian landed there, who
<PB N="92" REF="030274_0917_0FE57489B9A71FF0">
proved to be the principal per&s;on among his coun|trymen in this and the adjacent i&s;les. His name was Era&s;im Gregorioff Sin I&s;myloff. He arrived in a canoe that carried three per&s;ons, attended by twenty or thirty &s;maller canoes, each conducted by one man. Immediately after landing, they con&s;tructed a &s;mall tent for I&s;myloff, of materials which they had brought with them, and they afterwards made others for them&s;elves, of their canoes and paddles, which they covered with gra&s;s. I&s;myloff having invited the Captain and Mr. Webber into his tent, &s;et before them &s;ome dried &s;almon and berries. He appeared to be a man of &s;en&s;e; and the Captain felt no &s;mall mor|tification in not being able to conver&s;e with him except by &s;igns, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of figures, and other characters. The Captain reque&s;ted him to favour him with his company on board the next day, and accordingly he came with all his attend|ants. He had indeed, moved into the neigh|bourhood of our &s;tation, for the expre&s;s purpo&s;e of waiting upon us.</P>
<P>Captain Cook was in hopes of receiving from him the chart which his three countrymen had promi&s;ed, but he was di&s;appointed. However, I&s;myloff a&s;&s;ured him he &s;hould have it, and he kept his word. The Captain found him very well acquainted with the geography of tho&s;e parts, and with all the di&s;coveries which had been made in this quarter by the Ru&s;&s;ians. On &s;eeing the
<PB N="93" REF="030274_0918_0FE5748B9F29FF30">
modern maps, he in&s;tantly pointed out their er|rors: he &s;aid, he had accompanied Lieutenant Syndo, or (as he called him) Synd, in his nor|thern expedition; and according to his account, they did not proceed farther than T&s;chukot&s;koi No&s;s, or rather than St Lawrence's Bay; for he pointed on our chart to the very place where Captain Cook landed. From thence, he &s;aid, they went to an i&s;land, in the latitude of 63&deg; north, upon which they did not land. He did not re|collect the name of that i&s;land; but the Captain conjectured, that it was the &s;ame with that to which the appellation of Clerke's I&s;land had been given. To what place Synd repaired afterwards, or in what particular manner he employed the two years, during which, according to I&s;myloff, his re&s;earches la&s;ted, he was either unable or unwil|ling to inform us. Perhaps he did not comprehend our inquiries on this point; and yet, in almo&s;t every other thing, we found means to make him under&s;tand us. This inclined us to &s;u&s;pect, that he had not really been in this expedition, not|with&s;tanding what he had a&s;&s;erted.</P>
<P>Not only I&s;myloff, but al&s;o the others affirmed that they were totally unacquainted with the American continent to the northward; and that neither Lieutennant Synd, nor any other Ru&s;&s;ian, had &s;een it of late years. They called it by the &s;ame name which Mr. Staehlin has a&s;&s;i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ted to his large i&s;land, that is Ala&s;chka.</P>
<P><PB N="94" REF="030274_0919_0FE574900237C790">According to the information we obtained from I&s;myloff and his countrymen, the Ru&s;&s;ians have made &s;everal attempts to gain a footing upon that part of the North American continent, that lies contiguous to Oonala&s;hka and the adjacent i&s;lands, but have con&s;tantly been repul&s;ed by the inhabitants, whom they repre&s;ent as a very trea|cherous people. They made mention of two or three captains, or chief men, who had been murdered by them; and &s;ome of the Ru&s;&s;ians &s;hewed us wounds which they declared they had received there.</P>
<P>I&s;myloff al&s;o informed us, that in the year 1773, an expedition had been undertaken into the Frozen Ocean in &s;ledges over the ice, to three large i&s;lands, that are &s;ituate oppo&s;ite the mouth of the river Kovymy. But a voyage which he &s;aid he him&s;elf had performed, engaged our attention more than any other. He told us that on the 12th of May, 1771, he &s;ailed from Bolcheretzk, in Kamt&s;chataka, in a Ru&s;&s;ian ve&s;&s;el, to Mareekan, one of the Kurile I&s;lands, where there is an harbour, and a Ru&s;&s;ian &s;ettlement. From this i&s;land he proceeded to Japan, where his continuance appears to have been but &s;hort; for, as &s;oon as the Japane&s;e knew that he and his companions profe&s;&s;ed the Chri&s;tian faith, they made &s;igns for them to depart; but did not &s;o far as we could under&s;tand him, offer any in&s;ult or violence. From Japan he repaired to Canton
<PB N="95" REF="030274_0920_0FE57491E6FCFCD0">
in China; and from thence in a French &s;hip, to France. He then travelled to Peter&s;burg, and was afterwards &s;ent out again to Kamt&s;chatka. We could not learn what became of the ve&s;&s;el in which he fir&s;t embarked, nor what was the princi|pal intention of the voyage. His being unable to &s;peak one word of the French language, rendered this &s;tory rather &s;u&s;picious; he &s;eemed clear, how|ever, as to the times of his arrival at the diffe|rent places, and of his departure from them, which he put down in writing.</P>
<P>The next morning (Friday the 16), he offer|ed Captain Cook a &s;ea-otter &s;kin, which he &s;aid, was worth eighty roubles at Kamt&s;chatka. The Captain, however, thought proper to decline the offer; but except of &s;ome dried fi&s;h, and &s;eve|ral ba&s;kets of the lily, or <HI>&s;aranne</HI> root. In the afternoon, I&s;myloff, after having dined with Cap|tain Clerke, left us with all his retinue, but pro|mi&s;ed to return in a few days. Accordingly, on the 19th, he paid us another vi&s;it, bringing with him the charts above mentioned, which he per|mitted Captain Cook to copy; and the contents of which are the foundation of the following remarks.</P>
<P>The charts were two in number, they were both manu&s;cripts, and bore every mark of authen|ticity. One of them comprehended the Pen|&s;hin&s;kian &s;ea; the coa&s;t of Tartary, as low as the latitude of 41&deg; north; the Kurile I&s;lands, and the
<PB N="76" REF="030274_0921_0FE574936EC8BEE0">
penin&s;ula of Kamt&s;chatka. Since this chart had been made Waw&s;eelee Irkeechoff, a naval cap|tain explored, in the year 1758, the coa&s;t of Tartary, from Okot&s;k, and the river Amur, to Japan, or 41&deg; of northern latitude. We were in|formed by Mr. I&s;myloff, that a great part of the &s;ea-coa&s;t of Kamt&s;chatka had been corrected by him&s;elf; and he de&s;cribed the in&s;trument u&s;ed by him for that purpo&s;e, which mu&s;t have been a theodolite. He al&s;o told us, that there were only two harbours proper for &s;hipping, on all the ea&s;tern coa&s;t of Kamt&s;chatka, viz. the bay of Awat&s;ka, and the river Olutora, in the bottom of the gulph of the &s;ame name; that there was not one harbour on its we&s;tern coa&s;t; and that Yam&s;k was the only one except Okot&s;k, on all the we&s;tern &s;ide of the Pen&s;hin&s;kian &s;ea, till we come to the river Amur. The Kurile I&s;lands contain but one harbour, and that is on the north-ea&s;t &s;ide of Mareekan; where as we have already mentioned, the Ru&s;&s;ians have a &s;ettle|ment.</P>
<P>The other chart comprehended all the di&s;co|veries that the Ru&s;&s;ians had made to the ea&s;tward of Kamt&s;chatka, towards America. That part of the American coa&s;t, with which T&s;cherikoff fell in, is laid down in this chart between the latitude of 58&deg; and 50 &frac12;&deg; north and 75&deg; of ea&s;|tern longitude, from Okot&s;k, or 218 &frac12;&deg; from Greenwich; and the place where Beering an|chored
<PB N="97" REF="030274_0922_0FE5749556854240">
in 59 &frac12;&deg; of latitude, and 63 &frac12;&deg; of longitude from Okot&s;k, or 207&deg; from Greenwich. To &s;ay nothing of the longitude, which may, from &s;eve|ral cau&s;es, be erroneous, the latitude of the coa&s;t, di&s;covered by Beering and T&s;cherikoff, particu|larly that part of it which was di&s;covered by the latter, differs con&s;iderably from Mr. Muller's chart. Whether the chart now produced by I&s;|myloff, or that of Muller, be mo&s;t erroneous in this re&s;pect, it may be difficult to determine.</P>
<P>According to I&s;myloff's account, neither the number nor the &s;ituation of the i&s;lands which are di&s;per&s;ed between 52&deg; and 55&deg; of latitude, in the &s;pace between Kamt&s;chatka and America, is pro|perly a&s;certained. He &s;truck out about a third of them, a&s;&s;uring us that they did not exi&s;t; and he con&s;iderably altered the &s;ituation of others; which, he &s;aid, was nece&s;&s;ary, from the ob&s;erva|tions which he him&s;elf had made; and there was no rea&s;on to entertain a doubt about this. As the&s;e i&s;lands are nearly under the &s;ame parrallel, different navigators, mi&s;led by their different rec|konings, might ea&s;ily mi&s;take one i&s;land, or clu&s;ter of i&s;lands, for anothe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&punc; and imagine they had made a new di&s;covery, when they had only found old ones, in a po&s;ition &s;omewhat different from that which their former vi&s;itors had a&s;&s;igned to them.</P>
<P>The i&s;les of St. Theodore, St. Stephen, St. Abraham, St. Macarius, Seduction I&s;lands, and
<PB N="98" REF="030274_0923_0FE5749A9CCF7148">
&s;everal others, which are repre&s;ented in Mr. Mul|ler's chart, were not to be found in this now pro|duced to us; nay, I&s;myloff, and the other Ru&s;|&s;ians, a&s;&s;ured Captain Cook, that they had been frequently &s;ought for without effect. Neverthe|le&s;s, it is difficult to believe, that Mr. Muller could place them in his chart without &s;ome au|thority. Captain Cook, however&punc; confiding in the te&s;timony of the&s;e people, whom he thought competent witne&s;&s;es, omitted them in his chart; and made &s;uch corrections re&s;pecting the other i&s;lands, as he had rea&s;on to think were nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>We &s;hall now proceed to give &s;ome account of the i&s;lands, beginning with tho&s;e which are neare&s;t to Kamt&s;chatka, and computing the longitude from the harbour of Petropaulow&s;ka, in the bay of Awat&s;ka. The fir&s;t is Beering's i&s;land, in 55&deg; of no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">hern latitude, and 6&deg; of ea&s;tern longitude. At the di&s;tance of ten leagues from the &s;outhern extremity of this, in the direction of ea&s;t by &s;outh, or ea&s;t &s;outh-ea&s;t, &s;tands <HI>Maidenci O&s;troff</HI> or the Copper I&s;lands. The next i&s;land is Atakon, in the latitude of 52&deg; 45&prime; and in the longitude of 15&deg; or 16.&deg; The extent of this i&s;land is about eighteen leagues in the direction of ea&s;t and we&s;t; and it is perhaps the &s;ame land which Beering fell in with, and to which he gave the name of Mount St. John.</P>
<P>We next came to a clu&s;ter of &s;ix or more i&s;lands; two of which, Amluk and Atghka, are
<PB N="99" REF="030274_0924_0FE5749C69393CE8">
of con&s;iderable extent, and each of them has a good harbour. The middle of this group lies in the latitude of 52&deg; 30&prime;, and 28&deg; of longitude, from the bay of Awat&s;ka; and its extent is about four degrees, in the direction of ea&s;t and we&s;t. The&s;e are the i&s;les that I&s;myloff &s;aid were to be removed four degrees to the ea&s;tward. In the &s;ituation they have in Captain Cook's chart, was a group, comprehending ten little i&s;lands, which, we were informed, were entirely to be &s;truck out; and al&s;o two i&s;lands, &s;ituate between them and the group to which Oonala&s;hka appertains. In the place of the&s;e two, an i&s;land, named Amoghta, was introduced.</P>
<P>The &s;ituation of many of the&s;e i&s;lands may, per|haps, be er<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oneou&s;ly laid down. But the po&s;ition of the large&s;t group, of which Oonala&s;hka is one of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable i&s;lands, is free from &s;uch errors. Mo&s;t of the i&s;lands that compo&s;e this clu&s;ter, were &s;een by us; their longitude and latitude were therefore determined with tolerable accuracy, particularly the harbour of Samga|noodha, of Oonala&s;hka, which mu&s;t be con&s;idered as a fixed point. This group may be &s;aid to ex|tend as far as Halibut I&s;les, which are forty leagues di&s;tant from Oonala&s;hka, towards the ea&s;t-north-ea&s;t. Within the&s;e i&s;les a pa&s;&s;age, communicat|ing with Bri&s;tol Bay, was marked in I&s;myloff's chart; which converts about fifteen leagues of the coa&s;t, that Captain Cook had &s;uppo&s;ed to be part

of the continent, into an i&s;land, named Oonce, mak. This pa&s;&s;age might ea&s;ily e&s;cape us, being as we were informed, extremely narrow, &s;hallow, and only to be navigated through with boats, or ve&s;&s;els of very &s;mall burthen.</P>
<P>From the chart, as well as from the te&s;timony of I&s;myloff and his countrymen, it appears, that this is as far as the Ru&s;&s;ians have made any di&s;|coveries, or have extended them&s;elves, &s;ince the time of Beering. They all affirmed, that no per|&s;ons of that nation had &s;ettled them&s;elves &s;o far to the ea&s;tward, as the place where the natives gave the note to Captain Clerke; which being delivered to I&s;myloff for his peru&s;al, he &s;aid, that it had been written at Oomanak. From him we procured the name of Kodiak<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A Ru&s;&s;ian &s;hip had touched at Kodiak in the year 1776.</NOTE>, the large&s;t of Schumagin's I&s;lands; for it had no name a&s;&s;igned to it upon the chart which he produced. It may not be improper to mention, that no names were put to the I&s;lands which I&s;myloff &s;aid were to be &s;truck out of the charts; and Captain Cook, con|&s;idered this as &s;ome confirmation, that they have no exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>The American continent is here called, by the Ru&s;&s;ians, as well as by the i&s;landers, Ala&s;chka; which appellation, though it properly belongs only to that part which is contiguous to Oonce|mak,
<PB N="101" REF="030274_0926_0FE5749FD204D6B8">
is made u&s;e of by them when &s;peaking of the American continent in general.</P>
<P>This is all the intelligence we obtained from the&s;e people, re&s;pecting the geography of this part of the globe; and perhaps this was all the in|formation they were able to give. For they re|peatedly a&s;&s;ured Captain Cook, that they knew of no other i&s;lands, be&s;ides tho&s;e which were re|pre&s;ented upon this chart, and that no Ru&s;&s;ian had ever vi&s;ited any part of the American conti|nent to the northward, except that which is op|po&s;ite the country of the T&s;chut&s;kis.</P>
<P>If Mr. Staehlin was not greatly impo&s;ed upon, what could induce him to publi&s;h a map &s;o &s;ingu|larly erroneous, as his map of the New Northern Archipelago, in which many of the&s;e i&s;lands are jumbled together without the lea&s;t regard to truth? Neverthele&s;s, he him&s;elf &s;tyles it
<Q>a very accurate little map.</Q></P>
<P>I&s;myloff continued with us till the evening of the 21&s;t, when he took his final leave. Captain Cook entru&s;ted to his care a letter to the Lords of the Admiralty, enclo&s;ing a chart of all the northern coa&s;ts we had vi&s;ited. I&s;myloff &s;aid there would be an opportunity of tran&s;mitting it to Kamt&s;chatka, Okot&s;k, in the cour&s;e of the &s;ucceeding &s;pring; and that it would be at Peter&s;burgh the following winter. He gave the Captain a letter to Major Behm, Governor of Kamt&s;chatka, who re&s;ides at Bolcheret&s;k in that
<PB N="102" REF="030274_0927_0FE574A56C73BED8">
penin&s;ula; and another to the commanding of|ficers at Petropaulow&s;ka.</P>
<P>Mr. I&s;myloff &s;eemed to po&s;&s;e&s;s abilities that might entitle him to a higher &s;tation than that in which we found him. He had con&s;iderable knowledge in a&s;tronomy, and in the mo&s;t u&s;eful branches of the mathematics. Captain Cook made him a pre&s;ent of an Hadley's octant; and though, perhaps, it was the fir&s;t he had ever &s;een, he very quickly made him&s;elf acquainted with mo&s;t of the u&s;es to which that in&s;trument can be applied.</P>
<P>On Thur&s;day the 22d, in the morning, we made an attempt to get out to &s;ea, with the wind at &s;outh-ea&s;t, but did not &s;ucceed. In the after|noon of the 23d we were vi&s;ited by one Jacob Ivanovitch Sopo&s;nicoff, a Ru&s;&s;ian, who com|manded a &s;mall ve&s;&s;el a Oomanak. This man &s;eemed very mode&s;t, and would drink no &s;trong liquor, of which the other Ru&s;&s;ians, whom we had met with here, were extremely fond. He appeared to know what &s;upplies could be obtain|ed at the harbour of St. Peter and St. Paul, and the price of the various articles, more accurately than Mr. I&s;myloff. But, by all accounts, every thing, we &s;hould have occoa&s;ion to purcha&s;e at that place, was very &s;carce, and bore a high price. This man informed us, that he was to be at Petropaulow&s;ka in the en&s;uing May; and, as we under&s;tood, was to have the charge of Captain
<PB N="103" REF="030274_0928_0FE574A6F35144A0">
Cook's letter. He &s;eemed very de&s;irous of having &s;ome token from the Captain to carry to Major Behm; and, to gratify him, the Captain &s;ent a &s;mall &s;pying-gla&s;s.</P>
<P>After we had contracted an acquaintance with the&s;e Ru&s;&s;ians, &s;everal of our gentlemen at dif|ferent times, vi&s;ited their &s;ettlements on the i&s;land, where they always met with friendly treatment. It con&s;i&s;ted of a dwelling-hou&s;e and two &s;tore-hou&s;es. Be&s;ides the Ru&s;&s;ians, there was a num|ber of the Kamt&s;chadales, and of the Oonala&s;h|kans, as &s;ervants to the former. Some other natives of this i&s;land, who appeared to be in|dependent of the Ru&s;&s;ians, lived at the &s;ame place. Such of them as belonged to the Ru&s;&s;ians, were all of the male &s;ex; and they are either taken, or purcha&s;ed from their parents when young. There were, at pre&s;ent, about twenty of the&s;e who could be con&s;idered in no other light than as children. They all re&s;ide in the &s;ame hou&s;e, the Ru&s;&s;ians at the upper end, the Kamt&s;chadales in the middle, and the Oonala&s;hkans at the lower end, where is fixed a capacious boiler for preparing their food, which principally con&s;i&s;ts of fi&s;h, with the addi|tion of wild roots and berries. There is no great difference between the fir&s;t and la&s;t table, except what is produced by cookery, by which the Ru&s;|&s;ians can make indifferent things palatable. They dre&s;s whales fle&s;h in &s;uch a manner as to make it very good eating; and they have a kind of pan-pudding
<PB N="104" REF="030274_0929_0FE5747578690A40">
of &s;almon-roe, beaten up fine and fried, which is a tolerable &s;ub&s;titute for bread. They may perhaps, occa&s;ionally, ta&s;te real bread, or have a di&s;h in which flour is one of the ingredients. If we except the juice of berries, which they generally &s;ip at their meals, they drink no other liquor than pure water; and it &s;eems to be very fortunate for them that they have nothing &s;tronger.</P>
<P>As the i&s;land furni&s;hes them with &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, &s;o it does, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, with clothing. This is chiefly compo&s;ed of &s;kins. The upper gar|ment, which is made like a waggoner's frock, reaches down to the knees. Be&s;ides this, they wear a wai&s;tcoat or two, a pair of breeches, a fur cap, and a pair of boots, the legs of which are formed of &s;ome kind of &s;trong gut, but the &s;oles and upper leathers are of Ru&s;&s;ian leather. Their two chiefs, I&s;myloff and Ivanovitch, wore a calico frock, and they, as well as &s;everal others, had &s;hirts of &s;ilk.</P>
<P>Many Ru&s;&s;ians are &s;ettled upon all the mo&s;t con&s;iderable i&s;lands between Kamt&s;chatka and Oonala&s;hka, for the purpo&s;e of collecting furs. Their principal object is the &s;ea-beaver or otter; but &s;kins of inferior value al&s;o make a part of their cargoes. We neglected to inquire how long they have had a &s;ettlement upon Oonala&s;hka, and the neighbouring i&s;lands; but if we form our judgment on this point from the great &s;ubjection
<PB N="105" REF="030274_0930_0FE574A879DC4D38">
the natives are under, this cannot be of a very late date<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">According to Mr. Coxe, in his account of the di&s;coveries of the Ru&s;&s;ians, they began to frequent Oonala&s;hka in the year 1762.</NOTE>.

Tho&s;e we &s;aw ar|rived here from O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">&s;k in 1776, and were to re|turn in 1781.</P>
<P>As for the native inhabitants of this i&s;land, they are, to all appearance, a very peaceable, inof|fen&s;ive race of people; and, in point of hone&s;ty, they might &s;erve as a pattern to the mo&s;t civilized nations. But, from what we &s;aw of their neigh|bours, with whom the Ru&s;&s;ians are unconnected, we have &s;ome doubt whether this was their origi|nal di&s;po&s;ition; and are rather inclined to be of opinion, that it is the con&s;equence of their pre&s;ent &s;tate of &s;ubjection. Indeed, if we did not mi&s;|under&s;tand the Ru&s;&s;ians, they had been under the nece&s;&s;ity of making &s;ome &s;evere examples before they could bring the i&s;landers into tolerable or|der. If &s;everities were really inflicted at fir&s;t, the be&s;t excu&s;e for them is, that they have produced the mo&s;t beneficial effects; and, at pre&s;ent, the greate&s;t harmony &s;ub&s;i&s;ts between the Ru&s;&s;ians and the natives. The latter have their own chiefs in each i&s;land, and &s;eem to enjoy liberty and p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">|perty without mole&s;tation. Whether they are tributaries to the Ru&s;&s;ians, or not, we could never
<PB N="106" REF="030274_0931_0FE574AA8F1C9378">
learn; but we had &s;ome rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e that they are.</P>
<P>The people of Oonala&s;hka, are in general, ra|ther low of &s;tature, but plump, and well &s;haped. Their necks are commonly &s;hort, and they have &s;warthy chubby faces. They have black eyes, and &s;mall beards. Their hair is long, black, and &s;traight; the men wear it loo&s;e behind, and cut before; but the women generally tie it up in a bunch.</P>
<P>The dre&s;s of both &s;exes is the &s;ame with re&s;pect to fa&s;hion, the only difference is in the materials. The frock worn by the women is made of the &s;kins of &s;eals; and that of the men, of the &s;kins of birds; both reach below the knees. This con&s;titutes the whole dre&s;s of the females. But, over the frock, the men wear another compo&s;ed of gut, which water cannot penetrate; it has a hood to it, which is drawn over the head. Some of them wear boots; and all of them wear a &s;ort of oval &s;nouted cap, made of wood, with a rim that admits the head. They dye the&s;e caps with green and other colours; and round the upper part of the rim they fix the long bri&s;tles of &s;ome &s;ea animal, on which gla&s;s beads are &s;trung; and on the front is a &s;mall image or two formed of bone. They do not make u&s;e of paint; but the women puncture their faces &s;lightly, and both &s;exes perforate the lower lip, in which they fix pieces of bone. But it is as uncommon here to
<PB N="107" REF="030274_0932_0FE574AF890D5A30">
&s;ee a man with this ornament, as to ob&s;erve a woman without it. Some fix beads to the upper lip under the no&s;trils; and they all &s;u&s;pend orna|ments in their ears.</P>
<P>Fi&s;h, and other &s;ea animals, birds, roots, ber|ries, and even &s;ea-weed, compo&s;e their food. They dry quantities of fi&s;h during the &s;ummer, which they lay up in &s;mall huts for their u&s;e in winter; and, probably, they pre&s;erve berries and roots for the &s;ame &s;ea&s;on of &s;carcity. They eat mo&s;t of their provi&s;ions raw. Boiling and broil|ing were the only methods of cookery that we &s;aw practi&s;ed among them; and the former they in all probability learnt from the Ru&s;&s;ians. Some have in their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion &s;mall bra&s;s kettles: and tho&s;e who have not, make one of a flat &s;tone, with &s;ides of clay.</P>
<P>Captain Cook once happened to be pre&s;ent, when the chief of this i&s;land made his dinner of the raw head of a large halibut, ju&s;t caught. Before any part of it was given to the chief, two of his &s;ervants eat the gills with no other dre&s;&s;ing than &s;queezing out the &s;lime. After this, one of them having cut off the head of the fi&s;h, took it to the &s;ea, and wa&s;hed it, then came with it, and &s;eated him&s;elf by the chief; but not before he had pulled up &s;ome gra&s;s, upon a part of which the head was placed, and the re&s;t was &s;trewed be|fore the chief. He then cut large pieces off the cheeks, and put them within the reach of the
<PB N="108" REF="030274_0933_0FE574B11D3831B0">
chief, who &s;wallowed them with great &s;atisfaction. When he had fini&s;hed his meal, the remains of the head been cut in pieces, were given to the &s;ervants, who tore off the meat with their teeth, and knawed the bones like &s;o many dogs.</P>
<P>As the Oonala&s;hkans u&s;e no paint, they are le&s;s dirty in their per&s;ons than tho&s;e &s;avages who thus be&s;mear them&s;elves; but they are full as filthy in their hou&s;es. The following is their method of building: they dig, in the ground, an oblong pit, which rarely exceeds fifty feet in length, and twenty in breadth; but the dimen&s;ions are in general &s;maller. Over this excavation they form the roof of wood, which they cover fir&s;t with gra&s;s, and then with earth, &s;o that the external appearance re&s;embles a dung-hill. Near each end of the roof is left a &s;quare opening, which admits the light; one of the&s;e openings being intended only for this purpo&s;e, and the other be|ing al&s;o u&s;ed to go in and out by, with the a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance of a ladder, or rather a po&s;t, in which &s;teps are cut. In &s;ome of the hou&s;es there is another entrance below, but this is rather uncommon. Round the &s;ides and ends of the habitations, the families, &s;everal of which dwell together, have their &s;eparate apartments, where they &s;leep, and &s;it at work; not on benches, but in a &s;ort of con|cave trench, dug entirely round the in&s;ide of the hou&s;e and covered with mats, &s;o that this part is kept pretty clean and decent. The &s;ame cannot

be &s;aid of the middle of the hou&s;e, which is com|mon to all the families. For, though it is cover|ed with dry gra&s;s, it is a recepticle for every kind of dirt, and the place where the urine trough &s;tands; the &s;tench of which is by no means im|proved by raw hides, or leather, being almo&s;t continually &s;teeped in it. Behind, and over the trench, they place the few effects that they have in their profe&s;&s;ion, &s;uch as their mats, &s;kins, and apparel.</P>
<P>Their furniture con&s;i&s;ts of buckets, cans, wood|en bowls, &s;poons, matted ba&s;kets and &s;ometimes a Ru&s;&s;ian kettle or pot. All the&s;e uten&s;ils are made in a very neat manner; and yet we ob&s;erv|ed no other tools among them than the knife and the hatchet; that is, a &s;mall flat piece of iron, made like an adze, by fixing it into a crooked wooden handle.</P>
<P>Though the Ru&s;&s;ians live among the&s;e people, we found much le&s;s iron in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the lat|ter, than we had met with among other tribes on the neighbouring continent of America, who had never &s;een the Ru&s;&s;ians, nor perhaps had any in|tercour&s;e with them. Probably a few beads, and a &s;mall quantity of tobacco and &s;nuff, purcha&s;e all they have to &s;pare. There are few of them that do not both &s;moke and chew tobacco, and take &s;nuff.</P>
<P>They did not appear to be very de&s;irous of more iron, or to want any other in&s;truments, ex|cept
<PB N="110" REF="030274_0936_0FE5747CBA7F5F50">
&s;ewing needles, their own being formed of bone. With the&s;e they &s;ew their canoes, and make their clothes, and al&s;o work very curious embroidery. They u&s;e, in&s;tead of thread, the fibres of &s;inews, which they &s;plit to the thickne&s;s which is required. All &s;ewing is performed by the females. They are the &s;hoe-makers, taylors, and boat-builders, or boat-coverers; for the men, in all probability, con&s;truct the wooden frame, over which the &s;kins are &s;ewed. They manufac|ture mats, and ba&s;kets of gra&s;s, which are both &s;trong and beautiful. There is indeed, a neat|ne&s;s and perfection in mo&s;t of their work, that &s;hews they are neither deficient in ingenuity nor per&s;everance.</P>
<P>We did not ob&s;erve a fire-place in any one of their habitations. They are lighted, as well as heated, by lamps; which though &s;imple, ef|fectually an&s;wer the purpo&s;e for which they are intended. They con&s;i&s;t of a flat &s;tone, hollowed on one &s;ide like a plate; in the hollow part they put the oil, mixed with &s;ome dry gra&s;s, which &s;erves for a wick. Both &s;exes often warm them|&s;elves over one of the&s;e lamps, by placing it be|tween their legs, under their garments, and &s;it|ting thus over it for &s;everal minutes. The&s;e people produce fire both by colli&s;ion and attri|tion; the fir&s;t by &s;triking two &s;tones again&s;t each other, on one of which a quantity of brim&s;tone has been previou&s;ly rubbed. The latter method
<PB N="111" REF="030274_0937_0FE574B49D8E1210">
is performed by means of two pieces of wood, one of which is flat, and the other is a &s;tick of the length of about a foot and a half. They pre&s;s the pointed end of the &s;tick upon the other piece, whirling it nimbly round as a drill, and thus fire is procured in a few minutes. This method is common in many countries. It is not only practi&s;ed by the&s;e people, but al&s;o by the Kamt&s;chadales, the Greenlanders, the Otaheite|ans, the New-Hollanders, and the Brazilians, and probably by other nations. Some men of learning and genius have founded an argument on this cu&s;tom, to prove that this and that nation are of the &s;ame extraction. But ca&s;ual agree|ments, in a few particular in&s;tances, will not wholly authorize &s;uch a conclu&s;ion; nor, on the other hand, will a di&s;agreement, either in manners or cu&s;toms, between two different nations, prove of cour&s;e that they are of different extraction.</P>
<P>We &s;aw no offen&s;ive, nor even defen&s;ive weapon among the natives of Oonala&s;hka. It can &s;carce|ly be &s;uppo&s;ed that the Ru&s;&s;ians found them in &s;uch a defencele&s;s &s;tate; it is rather to be imagin|ed, that, for their own &s;ecurity, they have di&s;|armed them. Political motives, likewi&s;e, may have induced the Ru&s;&s;ians not to permit the&s;e i&s;landers to have any large canoes; for we can hardly believe they had none &s;uch originally, as we found them among all their neighbours.
<PB N="112" REF="030274_0938_0FE574B8BAEE22C8">
However, we ob&s;erved none here except two or three that belonged to the Ru&s;&s;ians.</P>
<P>The canoes in u&s;e among the natives, are &s;maller than any of tho&s;e we had &s;een upon the coa&s;t of America, from which however, they differ but little in their con&s;truction. The form of the&s;e terminates &s;omewhat abruptly; the head is forked, and the upper point of the fork pro|jects without the under one, which is level with the &s;urface of the water. It is remarkable that they &s;hould thus con&s;truct them, for the fork generally catch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> hold of every thing that comes in the way; to prevent which, they fix a piece of &s;mall &s;tick from one point to the other. In other re&s;pects they build their canoes after the manner of tho&s;e of the E&s;quimaux and Greenlanders; the frame being of &s;lender laths, and the covering of the &s;kins of &s;eals. They are about twelve feet in length, eighteen inches in breadth in the middle, and twelve or fourteen inches in depth. They &s;ometimes carry two per&s;ons, one of whom &s;its in the &s;eat, or round hole, which is nearly in the middle; and the other is &s;tretched at full length in the canoe. Round this hole is a rim or hoop of wood, about which, gut &s;kin is &s;ewed, which can be drawn together, or opened like a pur&s;e, with leathern &s;trings fitted to the outer edge. The man &s;its in this place, draws the &s;kin tight about his body over his gut-frock, and brings the ends of the thongs, or pur&s;e-&s;trings, over his
<PB N="113" REF="030274_0939_0FE574BA5248AA00">
&s;houlder. The &s;leeves of his frock are fa&s;tened tight round his wri&s;ts; and it being clo&s;e round his neck, and the hood being drawn over his head, where his cape confines it, water cannot ea&s;ily penetrate, either into the canoes, or to his body. If, however, any water &s;hould find means to in&s;inuate it&s;elf, the boatman dries it up with a piece of &s;punge. He makes u&s;e of a double-bladed paddle, which is held with both hands in the middle, &s;triking the water fir&s;t on one &s;ide, and then on the other, with a quick regular mo|tion. Thus the canoe is impelled at a great rate, and in a direction perfectly &s;traight. In &s;ailing from Egooch&s;hak to Samganoodha, though our &s;hip went at the rate of &s;even miles an hour, two or three canoes kept pace with her.</P>
<P>Their implements for hunting and fi&s;hing lie ready upon their canoes, under &s;traps fixed for the purpo&s;e. They are all extremely well made of wood and bone, and are not very different from tho&s;e u&s;ed by the Greenlanders. The only difference is in the point of the mi&s;&s;ile dart; which, in &s;ome that we &s;aw at this i&s;land, does not exceed an inch in length; whereas tho&s;e of the Greenlanders, according to Crantz, are about eighteen inches long. Indeed the&s;e darts, as well as &s;ome others of the in&s;truments, are ex|tremely curious. Their darts are generally made of fir, and are about four feet in length. One end is formed of bone, into which, by means of
<PB N="114" REF="030274_0940_0FE574BBE1C2B728">
a &s;ocket, another &s;mall piece of bone, which is barbed, is fixed, but contrived in &s;uch a manner, as to be put in and taken out without trouble: this is &s;ecured to the middle of the &s;tick by a &s;trong, though thin piece of twine, compo&s;ed of &s;inews. The bird, fi&s;h, or other animal is no &s;ooner &s;truck, than the pointed bone &s;lips out of the &s;ocket but remains fixed in its body by means of the barb. The dart then &s;erves as a float to trace the animal, and al&s;o contributes to fatigue it con&s;iderably, &s;o that it is ea&s;ily taken. They throw the&s;e darts by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a thin piece of wood, twelve or fourteen inches long; the middle of this is &s;lightly hollowed, for the bet|ter reception of the weapon; and at the termina|tion of the hollow, which does not extend to the end, is fixed a &s;hort pointed piece of bone, to prevent the dart from &s;lipping. The other ex|tremity is furni&s;hed with a hole for the reception of the fore-finger, and the &s;ides are made to coincide with the other fingers and thumb, in order to gra&s;p with greater firmne&s;s. The na|tives throw the&s;e darts to the di&s;tance of eighty or ninety yards, with great force and dexterity. They are exceedingly expert in &s;triking fi&s;h, both in the &s;ea, and in rivers. They al&s;o u&s;e hooks and lines, nets and wears. The lines are form|ed of twi&s;ted &s;inews, and the hooks of bone.</P>

Salmon and halibut appear to be in the greate&s;t plenty; and on them the people of the&s;e i&s;les principally &s;ub&s;i&s;t; at lea&s;t, they were the only &s;ort of fi&s;h, except cod, that we ob&s;erved to be laid up for their winter &s;tore.</P>
<P>Seals, and all that tribe of &s;ea animals, are not &s;o numerous as they are in many other &s;eas. Nor can this be thought &s;urprizing, &s;ince there is hardly any part of the coa&s;t, on either conti|nent, nor any of the&s;e i&s;lands, &s;ituate between them, but what is inhabited, and who&s;e inhabi|tants hunt the&s;e animals for their food and cloth|ing. Sea-hor&s;es are, indeed, to be found in prodigious numbers about the ice; and the &s;ea-otter is &s;carce any where to be met with but in this &s;ea. An animal was &s;ometimes &s;een by us, that blew after the manner of whales. It had a head re&s;embling that of a &s;eal. It was larger than that animal, and its colour was white, with dark &s;pots inter&s;per&s;ed. This was perhaps the <HI>manati,</HI> or &s;ea-cow.</P>
<P>Water fowls are neither found here in &s;uch numbers, nor in &s;uch variety, as in the northern parts of the Atlantic Ocean. However there are &s;ome in the&s;e parts, that we do not recollect to have &s;een in other countries; particularly the <HI>alca monochroa</HI> of Steller, and a black and white duck, which we judge to be different from the
<PB N="116" REF="030274_0942_0FE574C1C37E9B88">
&s;tone-duck that Kra&s;heninikoff has de&s;cribed in his hi&s;tory of Kamt&s;chatka. All the other birds we &s;aw are mentioned by this author, except &s;ome which we ob&s;erved near the ice; and the greate&s;t part of the&s;e, if not all, have been de&s;cribed by Martin, in his voyage to Greenland. It is &s;ome|what extraordinary, that penguins, which are &s;o frequently met with in many parts of the world, &s;hould not be found in this &s;ea. Albatro&s;&s;es too are extremely &s;carce here.</P>
<P>The few land-birds &s;een by us are the &s;ame with tho&s;e of Europe; but there were probably many others which we had no opportunity of ob&s;erving. A very beautiful bird was &s;hot in the woods at Norton Sound; which, we under|&s;tand, is &s;ometimes found in England, and known by the appellation of chatterer. Our people &s;aw other &s;mall birds there, but in no great abundance or variety; &s;uch as the bullfinch, the wood pecker, the yello&s;h-finch, and tit-mou&s;e.</P>
<P>Our excur&s;ions and ob&s;ervations being con|fined to the &s;ea-coa&s;t, we cannot be expected to have much knowledge of the animals or vegetables of the country. There are few other in&s;ects be|&s;ides mu&s;quetoes, and we &s;aw few reptiles except lizards. There are no deer at Oonali&s;hka, or any of the neighbouring i&s;lands; nor are there any dome&s;tic animals, not even dogs. Wea&s;els and foxes were the only quadrupeds we ob|&s;erved; but the natives told us, that they had
<PB N="117" REF="030274_0943_0FE574C416D71F48">
likewi&s;e hares, and the <HI>marmottas</HI> mentioned by Kra&s;heninikoff. Hence it appears, that the in|habitants procure the greate&s;t &s;hare of their food from the &s;ea and rivers. They are al&s;o indebted to the &s;ea for all the wood which they u&s;e for building, and other nece&s;&s;ary purpo&s;es; as there is not a tree to be &s;een growing upon any of the i&s;lands, nor upon the neighbouring coa&s;t of the continent.</P>
<P>The &s;eeds of plants are &s;aid to be coveyed, by various means, from one part of the world to another; even to i&s;lands lying in the mid&s;t of exten&s;ive oceans, and far di&s;tant from any other lands. It is therefore remarkable, that there are no trees growing on this part of the American continent, nor upon any of the adjacent i&s;les. They are doubtle&s;s as well &s;ituated for receiving &s;eeds, by the various ways we have heard of, as tho&s;e coa&s;ts which have plenty of wood. Nature has, perhaps, denied to &s;ome &s;oils the power of rai&s;ing trees, without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of art. With re&s;pect to the drift-wood, upon the &s;hores of the&s;e i&s;lands, we have no doubt of its coming from America. For though there may be none on the neighbouring coa&s;t, a &s;ufficient quantity may grow farther up the country, which may be broken loo&s;e by torrents in the &s;pring, and brought down to the &s;ea; and not a little may be convey|ed from the woody coa&s;ts, though &s;ituated at a more con&s;iderable di&s;tance.</P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="030274_0944_0FE574C5F6A4D888">Plants are to be found in great variety at Oonala&s;hka. Several of them are &s;uch as we meet with in Europe, and al&s;o in Newfoundland, and other parts of America; and others of them, which are likewi&s;e found in Kamt&s;chatka, are eaten by the natives both there and here. Of the&s;e, Kra&s;heninikoff has favoured us with de|&s;criptions. The principal one is the <HI>&s;aranne</HI> or lily root; which is about as large as a root of gar|lick, round, and compo&s;ed of a number of &s;mall cloves and grains. When boiled, it &s;omewhat re&s;embles &s;aloop; the ta&s;te of it is not di&s;agree|able. It does not appear to be in great abun|dance.</P>
<P>Among the food of the natives we may reckon &s;ome other wild roots; the &s;talk of a plant not un|like angelica; and berries of different &s;pecies, &s;uch as cranberries, hurtle-berries, bramble-ber|ries, and heath-berries; be&s;ides a &s;mall red berry, which, in Newfoundland, is denominated par|tridge berry; and another brown berry, with which we were unacquainted. This has &s;omewhat of the ta&s;te of a &s;loe, but is different from it in every other re&s;pect. When eaten in a con&s;iderable quan|tity it is very a&s;tringent. Brandy may be di&s;tilled from it. Captain Clerke endeavoured to pre&s;erve &s;ome; but they fermented, and became as &s;trong as if they had been &s;teeped in &s;pirits.</P>
<P>There were &s;everal plants which were &s;ervice|able to us, but are not u&s;ed either by the Ru&s;&s;ians
<PB N="119" REF="030274_0945_0FE574C7810FFCE8">
or natives. The&s;e were pea-tops, wild pur|&s;lain, a &s;ort of &s;curvy-gra&s;s, cre&s;&s;es, and a few others. We found all the&s;e very palatable, whe|ther dre&s;&s;ed in &s;oups or in &s;allads. The vallies and low grounds abound with gra&s;s, which grows very thick, and to a great length. We are of opinion, that cattle might &s;ub&s;i&s;t at Oonala&s;hka in every &s;ea&s;on of the year, without being hou&s;ed. The &s;oil, in many places, appeared to be capable of producing grain and vegetables. But, at pre|&s;ent, the Ru&s;&s;ian traders, and the natives, &s;eem contented with the &s;pontaneous productions of nature.</P>
<P>We ob&s;erved native &s;ulphur among the people of this i&s;land; but we could not learn where they procured it. We al&s;o found ochre, and a &s;tone that affords a purple colour; be&s;ides another that gives a good green. This la&s;t, in its natural &s;tate is of a greyi&s;h green hue, coar&s;e, and heavy. It readily di&s;&s;olves in oil; but when it is put into water, it altogether lo&s;es its properties. As for the &s;tones about the &s;hore and hills, we perceived in them nothing that was extraordinary.</P>
<P>The Oonala&s;hkans inter their dead on the tops of hills, and rai&s;e over the grave a little hillock. One of the natives, who attended Captain Cook in a walk into the country, pointed out &s;everal of the&s;e repo&s;itories of the dead. There was one of them by the &s;ide of a road, that had a heap of &s;tones over it; and all who pa&s;&s;ed it, added a &s;tone
<PB N="120" REF="030274_0946_0FE574CAE55720B8">
to the heap. In the country were &s;een &s;everal &s;tone hillocks, that &s;eemed to have been artificial|ly rai&s;ed. Some of them were, to appearance, of great antiquity.</P>
<P>We are unacquainted with the notions of the&s;e people re&s;pecting the deity, and a future &s;tate. We are equally uninformed with regard to their diver&s;ions; having &s;een nothing that could give us an in&s;ight into either.</P>
<P>They are extremely chearful and friendly among each other; and they always treated us with great civility. The Ru&s;&s;ians &s;aid they never had any connection with their women, on account of their not being chri&s;tians. Our people, however, were le&s;s &s;crupulous; and &s;ome of them had rea|&s;on to repent, that the women of Oonala&s;hka en|couraged their addre&s;&s;es; for their health was in|jured by a di&s;temper that is not wholly unknown here. The natives are al&s;o &s;ubject to the cancer, or a complaint of a &s;imilar nature, which tho&s;e who are attacked by it are &s;tudious to conceal. They do not appear to be long-lived. We did not &s;ee a per&s;on, man or woman, whom we could &s;uppo&s;e to be &s;ixty years of age; and we ob&s;erved very few who &s;eemed to exceed fifty.</P>
<P>We have occa&s;ionally mentioned, from the time of our arrival in Prince William's Sound, how remarkably the inhabitants on this north-we&s;tern &s;ide of America re&s;emble the E&s;quimaux and Greenlanders in various particulars of per|&s;on,
<PB N="121" REF="030274_0947_0FE574CCFA3BDE10">
dre&s;s, weapons, canoes and the like. We were; however, much le&s;s &s;truck with this, than with the affinity &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between the dialects of the Greenlanders and E&s;quimaux, and tho&s;e of Oonala&s;hka and Norton's Sound. But we mu&s;t ob&s;erve, with re&s;pect to the words which were collected by us on this &s;ide of America, that too much &s;tre&s;s is not to be laid upon their being accurately repre&s;ented; for, after the death of Mr. Ander&s;on, we had few who took any great degree of pains about &s;uch manners; and we have often found that the &s;ame word, written down by two or more per&s;ons, from the mouth of the &s;ame native, differed con&s;iderably, on bei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">g compared together. Neverthele&s;s, enough is certain to au|thorize this judgment, that there is great rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e, that all the&s;e nations are of the &s;ame extraction; and if that be the ca&s;e, there is little doubt of there being a northen communication by &s;ea, between the we&s;tern &s;ide of America, and the ea&s;tern &s;ide, through Baffin's Bay; which com|munication, however, is perhaps effectually &s;hut up again&s;t &s;hips, by ice, and other ob&s;tructions; &s;uch, at lea&s;t, was Captain Cook's opinion at this time.</P>
<P>The tides in the&s;e parts are not very con&s;ider|able, except in Cook's River. The flood comes from the &s;outh or &s;outh-ea&s;t, following the di|rection of the coa&s;t to the north-we&s;t. Between Cape Prince of Wales and Norton's Sound we
<PB N="122" REF="030274_0948_0FE574CEDB23CCB8">
found a current &s;etting towards the north-we&s;t, particularly off that Cape, and within Sledge I&s;land. This current, however, extended but a little way from the coa&s;t, and was neither con|&s;i&s;tent nor uniform. To the north of Cape Prince of Wales, we ob&s;erved neither tide nor current, either on the coa&s;t of America, or that of A&s;ia. This circum&s;tance gave ri&s;e to an opinion which &s;ome of our peo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> entertained, that the two coa&s;ts were connected either by land or ice; and that opinion received &s;ome degree of &s;trength, from our never having any hollow waves from the northward, and from our &s;eeing ice almo&s;t the whole way acro&s;s.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>ON Monday the 26th of October, we &s;ailed from Samganoodha harbour, when, the wind being &s;outherly, we &s;tood to the we&s;tward. We intended to proceed to the Sandwich I&s;lands, in order to pa&s;s a few of the winter months there, if we &s;hould meet with the nece&s;&s;ary refre&s;hments, and then advance in our progre&s;s to Kamt&s;chatka, &s;o as to arrive there about the middle of May in the en&s;uing year. This being determined on, the Commodore gave Captain Clerke in&s;tructions
<PB N="124" REF="030274_0950_0FE574D7A5A9AD88">
for proceeding in ca&s;e of &s;eparation; Sandwich I&s;lands being appointed for the fir&s;t place of ren|dezvous; and, for the &s;econd, Petropaulow&s;ka, in Kamt&s;chatka.</P>
<P>Having got out of the harbour, the wind veer|ed to the &s;outh-ea&s;t, with which we were carried to the we&s;tern part of Oonala&s;hka, by the even|ing. Here the wind was as &s;outh, and we &s;tretch|ed to the we&s;tward till the next morning at &s;even, at which time we wore, and &s;tood to the ea&s;t. The wind had now &s;o greatly increa&s;ed, as to re|duce us to our three cour&s;es. It blew in heavy &s;qualls, accompanied with rain, hail, and &s;now.</P>
<P>In the morning of the 28th, at about nine o'clock, Oonala&s;hka bore &s;outh-ea&s;t, about four leagues di&s;tant. The &s;trength of the gale was much abated, and, towards the evening, in&s;en|&s;ibly veered round to the ea&s;t, and &s;oon after got to north-ea&s;t, increa&s;ing to a very hard gale, at|tended with rain.</P>
<P>At half after &s;ix in the morning of the 29th, we di&s;covered land, which we &s;uppo&s;ed to be the i&s;land Amoghta. At eight, the wind having veered to the we&s;tward, we could not weather the i&s;land, and gave over plying; bearing away for Oonala&s;hka, in order to go to the north of it&punc; not daring, in &s;o hard a gale of wind, to attempt a pa&s;&s;age to the &s;outh-ea&s;t of it. When we bore away, the land was about four leagues di&s;tant. The longitude was 191&deg; 17&prime;, and the latitude 53&deg;
<PB N="125" REF="030274_0951_0FE574D976D4A2E8">
38&prime;. The Ru&s;&s;ian map is very inaccurate in the &s;ituation of this i&s;land.</P>
<P>Steering to the north-ea&s;t, we di&s;covered, at eleven o'clock, a rock, elevated like a tower, bearing north-north-ea&s;t, at the di&s;tance of about four leagues. The latitude was 53&deg; 57&prime;, and the longitude 191&deg; 2&prime;. We got &s;ight of Oonala&s;hka about three in the afternoon, when we &s;hortened &s;ail, and hauled the wind, being unable to get through the pa&s;&s;age before night. On the 20th at day-break having a very hard gale at we&s;t-north-we&s;t, with heavy &s;qualls and &s;now, we bore away under cour&s;es, and clo&s;e-reefed top-&s;ails. About noon we were in the middle of the &s;trait, and got through it at three in the after|noon, Cape Providence bearing we&s;t-&s;outh-we&s;t; the wind at we&s;t-north-we&s;t, blew a &s;trong gale, with fair weather.</P>
<P>On the 2d of November, the wind was at &s;outh; and, in the evening, blew a violent &s;torm, which occa&s;ioned us to bring too. Several guns were fired by the Di&s;covery, which we immedi|ately an&s;wered. We lo&s;t &s;ight of her at eight, and &s;aw her no more till eight the next morning. She joined us at ten; when, the height of the gale being over, and the wind having veered to we&s;t-north-we&s;t, we made &s;ail, and pur&s;ued our cour&s;e to the &s;outhward.</P>
<P>In the morning of Saturday the 7th, a &s;hag, or cormorant, &s;lew often round the &s;hip. As it
<PB N="126" REF="030274_0952_0FE574DB007854B0">
is not common for the&s;e birds to go far out of the &s;ight of land, we &s;uppo&s;ed there was &s;ome at no great di&s;tance; though we could not di&s;cover any. Having but little wind in the afternoon, Captain Clerke came on board with &s;ome melan|choly intelligence. He informed us that, the &s;econd night after we departed from Samganood|ha, the main tack of the Di&s;covery gave way, by which accident one man was killed, and the boat&s;wain, with two or three others, wounded. He added, that his &s;ails and rigging received con&s;iderable damage on the 3d, and that he fired the guns as a &s;ignal to bring too.</P>
<P>On the 8th, we had a gentle breeze at north, with clear weather. On the 9th, we had eight hours calm. To this &s;ucceeded a wind from the &s;outh, accompanied with fair weather. Such of our people as could handle a needle, were now employed to repair the &s;ails; and the carpenters were directed to put the boats in order.</P>
<P>At noon, on the 12th, the wind returned to the northward, and veered to the ea&s;t on the 15th. We now &s;aw a tropic bird, and a dolphin; the fir&s;t we had ob&s;erved in our pa&s;&s;age. On the 17th, the wind was &s;outhward, where it remained till the 19th in the afternoon, when it was in|&s;tantly brought round by the we&s;t to the north, by a &s;quall of wind and rain. The wind in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rea&s;ed to a very &s;trong gale, and brought us under double reefed top-&s;ails. In lowering the main
<PB N="127" REF="030274_0953_0FE574DCECDBC3C0">
top-&s;ail, in order to reef it, the force of the wind tore it out of the foot-rope, and it was &s;plit in &s;everal parts. We got, however, another top-&s;ail to the yard the next morning. We &s;teered to the &s;outhward till the 25th, at day-light, when we were in the latitude of 20&deg; 55&prime;.</P>
<P>The next morning, at day-break, land was di&s;covered, extending from &s;outh-&s;outh-ea&s;t to we&s;t. We &s;tood for it and at eight o'clock, it extended from &s;outh-ea&s;t to we&s;t, the neare&s;t part about two leagues di&s;tant. We now perceived that our di&s;covery of the group of the Sandwich I&s;lands had been very imperfect, tho&s;e which we had vi&s;ited in our progre&s;s north-ward, all lying to the leeward of our pre&s;ent &s;tation.</P>
<P>An elevated hill appeared in the country, who&s;e &s;ummit ro&s;e above the clouds. The land, from this hill, fell in a gradual &s;lope, terminating in a &s;teep rocky coa&s;t; the &s;ea breaking again&s;t it in a mo&s;t dreadful &s;urf. Unable to weather the i&s;land, we bore up, and ranged to the we&s;tward. We now perceived people on many parts of the &s;hore, and &s;everal hou&s;es and plantations. The country appeared to be well &s;upplied with wood and water, and &s;treams were &s;een, in various places, falling into the &s;ea.</P>
<P>It being of the utmo&s;t importance to procure a proper &s;upply of provi&s;ions at the&s;e i&s;lands, which could not po&s;&s;ibly be accompli&s;hed, if a free trade with the natives were to be permitted; Captain
<PB N="128" REF="030274_0954_0FE574E217F0FF70">
Cook publi&s;hed an order, prohibiting all per&s;ons on board the &s;hip from trading, except tho&s;e ap|pointed by him&s;elf and Captain Clerke; and the&s;e were under limitations of trading only for provi&s;ions and refre&s;hments. Injunctions were al&s;o laid again&s;t the admittance of women into the &s;hips, but under certain re&s;trictions. But the evil, which was intended to have been prevented by this regulation, had already got among&s;t them.</P>
<P>About noon, the coa&s;t extended from &s;outh-ea&s;t to north-we&s;t, the neare&s;t &s;hore three miles di&s;tant, in the latitude of 20&deg; 59&prime;, and the lon|gitude of 203&deg; 50&prime;. Some canoes came off, and, when they got along-&s;ide, many of the conduc|tors of them came into the &s;hip without he&s;ita|tion. We perceived that they were of the &s;ame nation as tho&s;e i&s;landers more to the leeward, which had already been vi&s;ited by us; and, as we under&s;tood, they were no &s;trangers to our having been there. It was, indeed, too evi|dent; the&s;e people having got the venereal di&s;|ea&s;e among them; which they probably contract|ed by an intercour&s;e with their neighbours, after we had left them.</P>
<P>Our vi&s;itors &s;upplied us with a quantity of cuttle-fi&s;h, in exchange for nails and iron. They brought but little fruit or roots, but &s;aid they had plenty of them on their i&s;land, as well as of hogs and fowls. The horizon being clear, in the evening, we &s;uppo&s;ed the we&s;ternmo&s;t land that
<PB N="129" REF="030274_0955_0FE574E39C638848">
we could &s;ee, to be an i&s;land, di&s;tinct from that off which we now were. Expecting the natives would return the next day, with the produce of their i&s;land, we plyed off the whole night, and &s;tood clo&s;e in &s;hore the next morning. At fir&s;t we were vi&s;ited but by few, but towards noon, many of them appeared, bringing with them po|tatoes, tarro, bread-fruit, plantains and &s;mall pigs&punc; all which were bartered for iron tools and nails, we having few other articles to give them. We traded with them till about four in the afternoon, at which time they had di&s;po&s;ed of all their cargoes; and not expre&s;&s;ing any in|clination to fetch more, we immediately made &s;ail.</P>
<P>On the 30th, in the afternoon, being off the north-ea&s;t end of the i&s;land, &s;ome more canoes came off. The&s;e principally belonged to Ter|reeoboo, a chief who came in one of them. He made the commodore a pre&s;ent of two or three pigs; and we procured a little fruit by bartering with the other people. In about two hours they all left us, except &s;even or eight who cho&s;e to remain on board. Soon after, a double &s;ailing canoe arrived to attend upon them, which we towed a&s;tern the whole night. In the evening, another i&s;land was &s;een to the windward, called, by the natives, <HI>Owhyhee.</HI> That, which we had been off for &s;ome days, was called <HI>Mowee.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="130" REF="030274_0956_0FE574E522E00E08">At eight in the morning, on the fir&s;t of De|cember, Owhyhee extended from &s;outh-ea&s;t to &s;outh-we&s;t. Perceiving that we could fetch Owhy|hee, we &s;tood for it, when our vi&s;itors from Mo|wee thought proper to embark in their canoes, and went a&s;hore. We &s;pent the night, &s;tanding off and on, the north &s;ide of Owhyhee.</P>
<P>On the 2d of December, in the morning, to our great &s;urprize, we &s;aw the &s;ummits of the mountains covered with &s;now. Though they were not of an extraordinary height, the &s;now, in &s;ome places, appeared to be of a con&s;iderable depth, and to have remained there &s;ome time. Drawing near the &s;hore, &s;ome of the natives ap|proached us, who appeared a little &s;hy at fir&s;t, but we prevailed on &s;ome of them to come on board; and, at length, induced them to return to the i&s;land, to bring a &s;upply of what we want|ed. We had plenty of company after the&s;e had reached the &s;hore, who brought us a tolerable &s;upply of pigs, fruit, and roots. We traded with them till about &s;ix in the evening, when we &s;tood off, in order to ply to windward round the i&s;land.</P>
<P>An eclip&s;e of the moon was ob&s;erved in the evening of the 4th. Mr. King u&s;ed, for the purpo&s;e of ob&s;erving, a night tele&s;cope, with a circular aperture at the object end. The Com|modore ob&s;erved with the tele&s;cope of one of Ram&s;den's &s;extants.</P>
<P><PB N="131" REF="030274_0957_0FE548CC1467A5E8">In the evening of the 6th, being near the &s;hore, and five leagues farther up the coa&s;t, we again traded with the natives; but, receiving only a trifling &s;upply, we &s;tood in the next morning, when the number of our vi&s;itors was con&s;iderable, with whom we trafficked, till two in the afternoon. We had now procured pork, fruit, and roots, &s;uf|ficient to &s;upply us for four or five days. We therefore made &s;ail, and &s;till plyed to windward.</P>
<P>Captain Cook having procured a great quan|tity of &s;ugar cane, and having, upon a trial, di&s;|covered that a decoction of it made very palat|able beer, he ordered &s;ome of it to be brewed for our general u&s;e; but, on the broaching of the ca&s;ks, not one of the crew would even ta&s;te it. The commodore, having no other motive in preparing this beverage, than that of pre&s;erv|ing our &s;pirits for a colder climate, neither exert|ed his authority, nor had recour&s;e to per&s;ua&s;ion, to induce them to drink it; well knowing that, &s;o long as we could be plentifully &s;upplied with other vegetables, there was no danger of the &s;curvy. But, that he might not be di&s;appointed in his views, he ordered that no grog &s;hould be &s;erved in either of the &s;hips. The Commodore, and his officers, continued to drink this &s;ugar|cane beer, whenever materials could be procured for brewing it. Some hops which we had on board, improved it much; and, it was, doubt|le&s;s, extremely whole&s;ome; though the Captain's
<PB N="132" REF="030274_0958_0FE574EBE93A94A8">
incon&s;iderate crew, could not be per&s;uaded but that it was injurious to their health.</P>
<P>Innovations, of whatever kind, on board a &s;hip, are &s;ure to meet with the di&s;approbation of the &s;eaman, though ever &s;o much to their advan|tage. Portable &s;oup, and &s;our krout, were con|demned, at fir&s;t, as improper food for human beings. Few commanders have introduced more u&s;eful varieties of food and drink into their &s;hips, than Captain Cook has done. Few others, in|deed, have had the opportunities, or have been driven to the nece&s;&s;ity of trying &s;uch experi|ments. It was, neverthele&s;s, owing to certain deviations from e&s;tabli&s;hed practice, that he was enabled, in a great degree, to pre&s;erve his peo|ple from the &s;curvy, a di&s;temper that has often made more havoc in peaceful voyages, than the enemy in military expeditions.</P>
<P>Having kept at &s;ome di&s;tance from the coa&s;t, till the 13th, we &s;tood in again, &s;ix leagues more to windward; and, after trading with the na|tives who came off to us, returned to &s;ea. We al&s;o intended to have approached the &s;hore again on the 15th, to get a fre&s;h &s;upply of fruit and roots; but the wind happening to be then at &s;outh-ea&s;t, we embraced the opportunity of &s;tretch|ing to the ea&s;tward, in order to get round the &s;outh-ea&s;t end of the i&s;land. The wind conti|nued at &s;outh-ea&s;t the greate&s;t part of the 16th; on the 17th, it was variable; and on the 18th,
<PB N="133" REF="030274_0959_0FE574EF3764D8E0">
it was continually veering&punc; Sometimes it blew in hard &s;qualls; and, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t other times, it was calm with thunder, lightning, and rain. The wind was we&s;terly for a few hours in the afternoon; but it &s;hifted, in the evening, to ea&s;t by &s;outh. The &s;outh-ea&s;t point of the i&s;land now bore &s;outh-we&s;t by &s;outh, di&s;tant about five leagues, and we expected that we &s;hould be able to weather it; but it became calm at one the next morning&punc; and we were left wholly at the mercy of a north-ea&s;terly &s;well, which greatly impelled us towards the land; in&s;omuch, that, before morning, lights were &s;een upon the &s;hore, which was then at the di&s;tance of about a league. It was a dark night, with thunder, lightning, and rain.</P>
<P>A breeze from the &s;outh-ea&s;t &s;ucceeded the calm at about three, blowing in &s;qualls, with rain. At day-break, the coa&s;t extended from north by we&s;t, to &s;outh-we&s;t by we&s;t, about half a league di&s;tant; a mo&s;t dreadful &s;urf breaking upon the &s;hore. We had certainly been in the mo&s;t imminent danger; from which we were not yet &s;ecure, the wind veering more ea&s;terly; &s;o that for a con&s;iderable time, we were but ju<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> able to keep our di&s;tance from the coa&s;t. Our &s;ituation was rendered the more alarming, by the leach-rope of the main top-&s;ail giving way, in con&s;equence of which the &s;ail was rent in two; the top-gallant-&s;ails giving way in the &s;am<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> man|ner. We &s;oon, however, got others to the yards,
<PB N="134" REF="030274_0960_0FE57423F05955A8">
and left the land a&s;tern. The Di&s;covery was at &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">me di&s;tance to the north, entirely clear from the land; nor did &s;he appear in &s;ight till eight o'clock.</P>
<P>It is an obvious remark, that the bolt-ropes to our &s;ails are extremely deficient in &s;trength or &s;ub&s;tance. This has frequently been the &s;ource of infinite labour and vexation; and occa&s;ioned the lo&s;s of much canva&s;s by their giving way. It was, upon this occa&s;ion, ob&s;erved by Captain Cook, that the cordage, canva&s;s, and other &s;tores, made u&s;e of in the navy, are inferior, in general, to tho&s;e u&s;ed in the merchant &s;ervice.</P>
<P>The Commodore al&s;o ob&s;erved, that an opi|nion prevailed among all naval officers, that the king's &s;tores were &s;uperior to any others; no &s;hips being &s;o well fitted out as tho&s;e of the navy. They might be right, he admits, as to the quan|tity; but, he apprehends, not with re&s;pect to the quality of the &s;tores. This, indeed, is not often tried; for the&s;e things are u&s;ually condemned, or converted to other u&s;es, before they are half worn out. Only &s;uch voyages as ours afford an opportunity of making the trial; our &s;ituation being &s;uch, as to render it nece&s;&s;ary to wear every thing to the extreme<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Captain Cook, in this particular, appears to be mi&s;taken; the be&s;t of cordage being made in the King's yard. In time of war, indeed, when the cordage is, from nece&s;&s;ity &s;upplied by contract, &s;ome of an in|ferior quality may &s;ometimes be made.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="135" REF="030274_0961_0FE574F628620B10">When day-light appeared, the natives a&s;hore exhibited a white flag, as a &s;ignal, we imagined, of peace and friend&s;hip. Many of them ventured out after us; but, as the wind fre&s;hened&punc; and we were unwilling to wait, they were pre&s;ently left a&s;tern. In the afternoon, we made another at|tempt to weather the ea&s;tern extreme, in which we failed; when the Commodore gave it up, and ran down to the Di&s;covery.</P>
<P>Our getting round the i&s;land was, indeed, a matter of no importance; for we had &s;een the ex|tent of it to the &s;outh-ea&s;t, which was all the Commodore aimed at: the natives having in|formed us, that there was no other i&s;land to the windward of this. But as we were &s;o near ac|compli&s;hing our de&s;ign, we did not entirely aban|don the idea of weathering it, and continued to ply.</P>
<P>At noon, on the 20th, the &s;outh-ea&s;t point bore &s;outh, at the di&s;tance of three leagues. The &s;nowy hills bore we&s;t-north-we&s;t; and we were within four miles of the neare&s;t &s;hore. We were vi&s;ited, in the afternoon, by &s;ome of the natives, who came off in their canoes, bringing with them pigs and plantains. The latter were highly ac|ceptable, we having been without vegetables for &s;ome days; but this was &s;o incon&s;iderable a &s;up|ply (hardly &s;ufficient for one day) that we &s;tood in the next morning, till within about four miles of the land, when a number of canoes came off
<PB N="136" REF="030274_0962_0FE5742AACC8D418">
laden with provi&s;ions. The people in them con|tinued trading with us till four o'clock, in the af|ternoon; at which time we had got a good &s;up|ply; we therefore made &s;ail, &s;tretching off to the northward.</P>
<P>We met with le&s;s re&s;erve and &s;u&s;picion, in our intercour&s;e with the people of this i&s;land, than we had ever experienced among any tribe of &s;a|vages. They frequently &s;ent up into the &s;hip the articles they meant to barter, and afterwards came in them&s;elves, to traffic on the quarter deck. The inhabitants of Otaheite, who we have &s;o often vi&s;ited, have not that confidence in our in|tegrity. Whence it may be inferred, that tho&s;e of Owhyhee are more faithful in their dealings with each other, than the Otaheitans.</P>
<P>It is but ju&s;tice to ob&s;erve, that they never at|tempted to over-reach us in exchanges, nor to commit a &s;ingle theft. They perfectly under|&s;tand trading, and clearly comprehended the rea|&s;on of our plying upon the coa&s;t. For, though they brought off plenty of pigs, and other provi|&s;ions, they were particular in keeping up their price; and, rather than di&s;po&s;e of them at an un|dervalue, would carry them to &s;hore again.</P>
<P>At eight in the morning of the 22d, we tack|ed to the &s;outhward. At noon, the &s;nowy peak bore &s;outh-we&s;t. We &s;tood to the &s;outh-ea&s;t till midnight, when we tacked to the north till four. We had hopes of weathering the i&s;land, and
<PB N="137" REF="030274_0963_0FE57473F1AC2020">
&s;hould have &s;ucceeded, if a calm had not en&s;ued, and left us to the mercy of a &s;well, which im|pelled us towards the land, from which we were not above the di&s;tance of two leagues. Some light puffs of wind, however, took us out of danger. Whil&s;t we lay in this &s;ituation, &s;ome i&s;landers came off with hogs, fowls, and fruit. From one of the canoes we got a goo&s;e, which was not larger than a Mu&s;covy duck. The co|lour of its plumage was dark grey, and the bill and legs were black.</P>
<P>After purcha&s;ing what the natives had brought off, we made &s;ail, and &s;tretched to the north. At midnight, we tacked and &s;tood to the &s;outh-ea&s;t. Imagining the Di&s;covery would &s;ee us tack, we omitted the &s;ignal; but it afterwards appeared that &s;he did not &s;ee us, and continued &s;tanding to the north; for, the next morning, at day-light, &s;he was not to be &s;een. But, as the weather was now hazy, we could not &s;ee far; it was therefore po&s;&s;ible that the Di&s;covery might be following us. At noon, we were in the lati|tude of 19&deg; 55&prime;, and in the longitude of 205&deg; 3&prime;; and were two leagues from the neare&s;t part of the i&s;land. In the evening, at &s;ix, the &s;outhern|mo&s;t part of the i&s;land bore &s;outh-we&s;t, the near|e&s;t &s;hore about &s;even miles di&s;tant. We had, therefore, now &s;ucceeded in our endeavours, in getting to the windward of the i&s;land.</P>
<P><PB N="138" REF="030274_0964_0FE5742C323D4848">The Di&s;covery was not yet within &s;ight, but as the wind was favourable for her to follow us, we expected &s;he would &s;hortly join us. We kept crui&s;ing off this point of the i&s;land, till Captain Clerke was no longer expected here. It was, at length, conjectured, that he was gone to leeward, in order to meet us that way, not having been able to weather the north-ea&s;t part of the i&s;land.</P>
<P>Keeping generally from five to ten leagues from the land, only one canoe came off to us till the 28th; at which time we were attended by about a dozen, bringing, as u&s;ual, the produce of the i&s;land. We were concerned that the peo|ple had been at the trouble of coming, as we could not po&s;&s;ibly trade with them, not having yet con&s;umed our former &s;tock; and experience had convinced us, that the hogs could not be kept a live, nor the roots be many days pre&s;erved from putrefaction. We meant, however, not to leave this part of the i&s;land till we had got a &s;up|ply, as we could not ea&s;ily return to it, if it &s;hould hereafter be found nece&s;&s;ary. On the 30th, we began to be in want, but a calm prevented us from approaching the &s;hore. A breeze, however, &s;prung up at midnight, which enabled us to &s;tand in for the land at day-break. At ten o'clock the i&s;landers vi&s;ited us, bringing with them a quan|tity of fruit and roots, but only three &s;mall pigs. This &s;canty &s;upply was, perhaps, occa&s;ioned by
<PB N="139" REF="030274_0965_0FE5747704F702E8">
our not having purcha&s;ed tho&s;e which had lately been brought off.</P>
<P>For the purpo&s;es of traffic we brought too, but we were &s;hortly interrupted with an exce&s;&s;ive rain; and, indeed, we were too far from the &s;hore; nor could we venture to go nearer, as we could not, for a moment, depend upon the wind's con|tinuing where it was. The &s;well too, was ex|tremely high, and &s;et obliquely upon the &s;hore, where it broke in a mo&s;t frightful &s;urf. We had fine weather in the evening, and pa&s;&s;ed the night in making boards. Before day-break, on the 1&s;t of January, 1779, the atmo&s;phere was laden with heavy clouds; and the new year was u&s;her|ed in with a heavy rain. We had a light breeze &s;outherly, with &s;ome calms. At ten, the rain cea&s;ed, the &s;ky became clear, and the wind fre&s;h|ened.</P>
<P>Being now about four or five miles from the &s;hore, &s;ome canoes arrived with hogs, fruit, and roots. We traded with the people in the canoes, till three in the afternoon; when, being pretty well &s;upplied, we made &s;ail, in order to pro|ceed to the lee &s;ide of the i&s;land, in &s;earch of the Di&s;covery. We &s;tretched to the ea&s;tward, till midnight, when the wind favoured us, and we went upon the other tack.</P>
<P>The 2d, 3d, and 4th, were pa&s;&s;ed in running down the &s;outh-ea&s;t &s;ide of the i&s;land, &s;tanding off and on during the nights, and employing part
<PB N="140" REF="030274_0966_0FE5742E1872B290">
of each day in laying too, to give the natives an opportunity of trading with us. They frequently came off to us, at the di&s;tance of five leagues from the &s;hore, but never brought much with them, at tho&s;e times, either from a fear of lo&s;ing their articles in the &s;ea, or from the uncertainty of a market. We procured a quantity of &s;alt, of a mo&s;t excellent quality.</P>
<P>In the morning of the 5th, we pa&s;&s;ed the &s;outh point of the i&s;land, in the latitude of 18&deg; 54&prime;, beyond which the coa&s;t trends north 60&deg; we&s;t. A large village is &s;ituated on this point, many of who&s;e inhabitants thronged off to the &s;hip with hogs and women. The lattter could not po&s;&s;ibly be prevented from coming on board, and they were le&s;s re&s;erved than any women we had ever &s;een. They &s;eemed, indeed, to have vi&s;ited us with no other view than to tender us their per|&s;ons.</P>
<P>Having now got a quantity of &s;alt, we pur|cha&s;ed only &s;uch hogs as were large enough for &s;alting; refu&s;ing all tho&s;e that were under &s;ize. But we could &s;eldom procure any that exceeded the weight of &s;ixty pounds. Happily for us, we had &s;till &s;ome vegetables remaining, as we were now &s;upplied with but few of tho&s;e productions. Indeed, from the appearance of this part of the country, it &s;eemed incapable of affording them. Evident marks pre&s;ented them&s;elves of its having been laid wa&s;te by the explo&s;ion of a volcano;
<PB N="141" REF="030274_0967_0FE574F0C316D138">
and though ye had not &s;een any thing of the kind, the deva&s;tation it had made in the neigh|bourhood was but too vi&s;ible.</P>
<P>Though the coa&s;t is &s;heltered from the reign|ing winds, it had no anchorage; a line of an hundred and &s;ixty fathoms not reaching the bot|tom within half a mile of the &s;hore. The na|tives having now left us, we ran a few miles down the coa&s;t in the evening, and pa&s;&s;ed the night in &s;tanding off and on.</P>
<P>We were again vi&s;ited by the natives the next morning. They came laden with the &s;ame arti|cles of commerce as before. Being not far from the &s;hore, Captain Cook &s;ent Mr. Bligh, in a boat in order to &s;ound the coa&s;t, and al&s;o to go a&s;hore in &s;earch of fre&s;h water. He reported, on his return, that, within two cables lengths of the &s;hore, he found no &s;oundings with a line of one hundred and &s;ixty fathoms; that on the land, he could di&s;cover no &s;tream or &s;pring; that there was &s;ome rain water in holes, upon the rocks, which the &s;pray of the &s;ea had rendered bracki&s;h; that the whole &s;urface of the country was compo&s;ed of flags and a&s;hes inter&s;per&s;ed with a few plants.</P>
<P>To our great &s;atisfaction, the Di&s;covery made her appearance between ten and eleven, coming round the &s;outh point of the i&s;land, and &s;he join|ed us about one. Captain Clerke then came on board the Re&s;olution, and acquainted us, that
<PB N="142" REF="030274_0968_0FE57433496C27B8">
having crui&s;ed four or five days where we were &s;eparated, he plied round the ea&s;t &s;ide of the i&s;land; where meeting with unfavourable winds, he had been driven to &s;ome di&s;tance from the coa&s;t. One of the i&s;landers continued on board the whole time, at his own reque&s;t, having re|fu&s;ed to leave the &s;hip, though opportunities had pre&s;ented them&s;elves. The night was &s;pent in &s;tanding off and on. In the morning we &s;tood in again, and were vi&s;ited by many of the na|tives. At noon, the latitude was 19&deg; 1&prime;, and the longitude 203&deg; 26&prime;; the neare&s;t part of the i&s;land two leagues di&s;tant. On the 8th, at day-break, we perceived, that whil&s;t we were plying in the night, the currents had carried us back con&s;ider|ably to windward; and that we were now off the &s;outh-we&s;t point of the i&s;land, where we brought too, in order to enable the inhabitants to trade with us.</P>
<P>The night was &s;pent in &s;tanding off and on. Four men and ten women, who came on board the preceding day, were with us &s;till. The Commodore not liking the company of the lat|ter, we &s;tood in &s;hore, on the 9th, about noon, &s;olely with a view of getting rid of our gue&s;ts; when, &s;ome canoes coming off, we embraced that opportunity of &s;ending them away.</P>
<P>On the 10th, in the morning, we had light airs from north-we&s;t, and calms; at eleven, the wind fre&s;hened at north north-we&s;t, which &s;o
<PB N="143" REF="030274_0969_0FE574F2A80D72D0">
greatly retarded us, that, in the evening at eight, the &s;outh &s;nowy hill bore north, 1 &frac12;&deg; ea&s;t.</P>
<P>At four o'clock in the morning of the 11th, the wind being at we&s;t, we approached the land in expectation of getting &s;ome refre&s;hments. The natives &s;eeing us &s;o near them, began to come off, and we continued trading with them the whole day; though we procured but a very &s;canty &s;up|ply, many of tho&s;e who came off in their canoes, not having a &s;ingle thing to barter. From this circum&s;tance, it appeared, that this part of the i&s;land was extremely poor, and had already fur|ni&s;hed us with every thing they could &s;pare.</P>
<P>The 12th was employed in plying off and on, with a fre&s;h gale at we&s;t. A mile from the &s;hore we found ground, at the depth of fifty-five fa|thoms. At five we &s;tood to the &s;outhward, and at midnight we had a calm. The next morning, at eight, we had a &s;mall breeze at &s;outh-&s;outh-ea&s;t, and &s;teered for the land.</P>
<P>A few canoes came off to us with &s;ome hogs: but they brought no vegetables, which were now much wanted. In the evening we had got the length of the &s;outh-we&s;t point of the i&s;land, but, by the veering of the wind, we lo&s;t in the night all that we had gained in the day. Being in the &s;ame &s;ituation the next morning, &s;ome more ca|noes attended us; but they brought nothing which we &s;tood in need of. We were now de&s;ti|tute of roots and fruit, and therefore obliged to
<PB N="144" REF="030274_0970_0FE57434CE45DAB8">
have recour&s;e to our &s;ea provi&s;ions. Some canoes, however, arrived from the northward, which &s;up|plied us with &s;ome hogs and roots.</P>
<P>On the 15th, we had variable light airs till five in the afternoon, when a breeze at ea&s;t-north-ea&s;t &s;prung up, and enabled us to &s;teer along &s;hore to the northward. The weather was this day re|markably fine, and we had plenty of company; many of whom continued with us on board all night, and their canoes were towed a&s;tern. On the 16th, at day-break, &s;eeing the appearance of a bay, the Commodore &s;ent Mr. Bligh, with a boat from each &s;hip, to &s;urvey it, being now about three leagues off.</P>
<P>Canoes arrived from all quarters; in&s;omuch that by ten o'clock in the morning, there were at lea&s;t a thou&s;and about the two &s;hips, crouded with people, and laden with hogs and other pro|vi&s;ions. We were perfectly convinced of their having no ho&s;tile intentions; not a &s;ingle per&s;on having a weapon with him of any &s;ort. Trade and curio&s;ity were their only inducements to vi&s;it us. Such numbers as we had frequently on board, it might be expected that &s;ome of them &s;hould betray a thievi&s;h di&s;po&s;ition. One of them took a boat's rudder from the &s;hip, and was not de|tected till it was too late to recover it. Captain Cook imagined this to be a proper opportunity to &s;hew the&s;e i&s;landers the u&s;e of fire arms; two or three m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;quets, and as many four pounders,
<PB N="145" REF="030274_0971_0FE57461CB839220">
were, by his orders, fired over the canoe which went away with the rudder. But as the &s;hot was not intended to take effect, the &s;urrounding mul|titude were more &s;urprized than frightened.</P>
<P>Mr. Bligh, when he returned in the evening, reported, that he had found a bay with good an|chorage, and fre&s;h water, in a de&s;irable &s;ituation. Into this bay, the Commodore determined to take his &s;hips, in order to refit, and &s;upply our&s;elves with refre&s;hments. At the approach of night, the mo&s;t con&s;iderable part of our vi&s;itors retired to the &s;hore; but many, at their own earne&s;t re|que&s;t, were permitted to &s;leep on board. Curio|&s;ity, at lea&s;t with &s;ome of them, was not the only motive, for &s;everal articles were mi&s;&s;ing the next morning; in con&s;equence of which, the Com|modore came to a re&s;olution not to admit &s;o many on any future night.</P>
<P>On the 17th, at eleven in the forenoon, we anchored in the bay, called by the natives <HI>Karaka|kooa,</HI> within a quarter of a mile of the north-ea&s;t &s;hore. The &s;outh point of the bay bearing &s;outh by we&s;t, and the north point we&s;t half north. After we were moored, the &s;hips continued much crouded with the natives, and &s;urrounded by a va&s;t multitude of canoes. In the cour&s;e of our voyages, we had no where &s;een &s;uch va&s;t numbers of people a&s;&s;embled at one place. Be&s;ides tho&s;e who vi&s;ited us in canoes, all the &s;hore was cover|ed with &s;pectators, and hundreds were &s;wimming

about the &s;hips, like &s;hoals of fi&s;h. We were &s;truck with the &s;ingularity of this &s;cene: and few of us lamented that we had not &s;ucceeded in our late endeavours, to find a northern pa&s;&s;age home|ward. To this di&s;appointment we were indebt|ed for revi&s;iting the <HI>Sandwich I&s;lands,</HI> and for enriching our voyage with a di&s;covery, in many re&s;pects the mo&s;t important that has been made by the Europeans in the Pacific Ocean.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE Bay of Karakakooa is &s;ituated in the di&s;trict of Acona, on the we&s;t &s;ide of the i&s;land of Owhyhee. It extends about a mile in
<PB N="148" REF="030274_0974_0FE57438348A87F0">
depth, and is bounded by two points of land, bearing &s;outh-ea&s;t and north-we&s;t from each other, at the di&s;tance of half a league. The north point is flat and barren, on which is &s;ituated the village of Kowrowa. A more con&s;iderable village, called Kakooa, &s;tands in the bottom of the bay, near a grove of &s;tately cocoa-trees. A high rocky cliff, inacce&s;&s;ible from the &s;ea-&s;hore, runs be|tween them. Near the coa&s;t, on the &s;outh &s;ide, the land has a rugged appearance; beyond which the country gradually ri&s;es, and abounds with cultivated inclo&s;ures, and groves of cocoa-trees. The habitations of the people are &s;cattered about in great plenty. Round the bay the &s;hore is co|vered with a black coral rock, except at Kakooa, where there is an excellent &s;andy beach, with a <HI>Morai</HI> at one extremity, and a &s;pring of fre&s;h water at the other. We moored at the north &s;ide of this bay, and within a quarter of a mile from the &s;hore.</P>
<P>The inhabitants, perceiving our intention to anchor in the bay, came off in a &s;toni&s;hing num|bers, expre&s;&s;ing their joy by &s;inging, &s;houting, and the mo&s;t extravagant ge&s;tures. The decks, fides, and riggings of our &s;hips were covered with them. Women and boys, who were unable to procure canoes, came &s;wimming round us in great multitudes; &s;ome of whom, not finding room to get on board, amu&s;ed them&s;elves the whole day by playing in the water.</P>

<P><PB N="149" REF="030274_0977_0FE5746A3A418360">One of the chiefs, who vi&s;ited the Re&s;olution, was named Pareea. Though a young man, we &s;oon di&s;covered him to be a per&s;on of great au|thority. He told Captain Cook that he was <HI>Jackane</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">We could not learn with certainty whether this was a name of offi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&punc; or expre&s;&s;ive of &s;ome degree of affinity.</NOTE> to the &s;overeign of the i&s;land, who was then on a military expedition at Mowee; whence he was expected to return in a few days. Some pre&s;ents from the Commodore attached him to our intere&s;ts, and we found him exceedingly u&s;e|ful to us. Before we had been long at anchor, the Di&s;covery had &s;o many people hanging on one &s;ide, that &s;he was ob&s;erved to heel con&s;ider|ably; and our people found it impo&s;&s;ible to pre|vent the crowds from pre&s;&s;ing into her. Captain Cook, apprehen&s;ive that &s;he might receive &s;ome injury, communicated his fears to Pareea, who in&s;tantly cleared the &s;hip of its incumberances, and di&s;per&s;ed the canoes that &s;urrounded her.</P>
<P>From this circum&s;tance, it appears that the chiefs have a mo&s;t de&s;potic authority over the in|ferior people. An in&s;tance, &s;imilar to this, hap|pened on board the Re&s;olution; where the crowd &s;o far impeded the ordinary bu&s;ine&s;s of the &s;hip, that we found it nece&s;&s;ary to apply to Kaneena, another chief, who had al&s;o attached him&s;elf par|ticularly to Captain Cook. The inconvenience we &s;uffered was no &s;ooner mentioned, than he ordered the natives immediately to quit the ve&s;|&s;el;
<PB N="150" REF="030274_0978_0FE5743CE28E86F0">
when, without a moment's he&s;itation&punc; we &s;aw them all jump over-board; except one per&s;on, who loitered behind, and, by his manner, ex|pre&s;&s;ed &s;ome degree of unwillingne&s;s to obey. Kaneena ob&s;erving this contempt of his autho|rity, took hold of him immediately, and threw him into the &s;ea.</P>
<P>The&s;e two chiefs were exceedingly well propor|tioned, and had countenances remarkable plea&s;|ing. Kaneena, who&s;e portrait was drawn by Mr. Webber, was as fine a figure as can be &s;een. His height was about &s;ix feet, his features were regu|lar and expre&s;&s;ive, his deportment was ea&s;y, firm, and graceful, and he had dark lively eyes.</P>
<P>Mention has already been made, that while we were cruizing off this i&s;land, the inhabitants had acted fairly and hone&s;tly, without manife&s;ting the lea&s;t propen&s;ity to theft; which was the more remarkable, becau&s;e tho&s;e with whom we had hitherto any dealings, were people of the lowe&s;t rank, &s;uch as fi&s;hermen or &s;ervants. The ca&s;e was now exceedingly altered. The multitude of i&s;landers, who blocked up every part of the &s;hips, afforded opportunity of pilfering without danger of di&s;covery, and even if detected, mu&s;t have e&s;caped with impunity from our inferiority in number. To the encouragement of their chiefs this alteration might al&s;o be attributed; for, as we frequently traced the booty into the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion
<PB N="151" REF="030274_0979_0FE574689FC41C50">
of &s;ome great men, there is little doubt but the&s;e depredations were made at their in&s;tigation.</P>
<P>The Re&s;olution having got into her &s;tation, the two chiefs, Pareea and Kaneena, brought a third on board, who&s;e name was Koah. He was re|pre&s;ented to us as a prie&s;t, and one who, in his early days, had di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf as a warrior. He was a little old emaciated figure, having &s;ore red eyes, and his body covered with a leprous &s;curf, occa&s;ioned by the immoderate u&s;e of the <HI>ava.</HI> Being conducted to the cabin, he ap|proached the Commodore with the greate&s;t de|ference, threw a piece of red cloth over his &s;houlders, and retreated a few paces, made an offering of a &s;mall pig, at the &s;ame time pro|nouncing a di&s;cour&s;e of a con&s;iderable length.</P>
<P>During our coutinuance at Owhyhee, this ceremony was repeated often, and from a variety of circum&s;tances, appeared to us to be a kind of religious adoration. Red cloth is an article with which their idols are arrayed, and a pig is their common offering to the <HI>Eatooas.</HI> Their &s;peeches were delivered with a volubility that indicated them to be conformable to &s;ome ritual.</P>
<P>At the conclu&s;ion of this ceremony, Koah dined with the Commodore, and eat plentifully of the viands before him; but, like mo&s;t of the i&s;landers in the&s;e &s;eas, he could hardly be induced to ta&s;te our wine or &s;pirits a &s;econd time. In the even|ing, the Commodore, Mr. King, and Mr. Baily,
<PB N="152" REF="030274_0980_0FE5743EEF2D9B30">
accompanied him on &s;hore. As &s;oon as we land|ed on the beach, we were preceded by four men, bearing each a wand tipt with dog's hair, and pronouncing, with a loud voice, a &s;hort &s;en|tence, in which the word <HI>Orono</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This was Captain Cook's general appellation among the natives of Owhyhee. Sometimes it was applied by them to an invi&s;ible being inhabiting heaven. It was al&s;o a title of great rank in the I&s;land.</NOTE> was very di&s;|tingui&s;hable. The crowd which had a&s;&s;embled on the &s;hore, retired at our approac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">; and not an individual was to be &s;een, except a few who had pro&s;trated them&s;elves on the ground, near the habitations of the adjacent village.</P>
<P>Before we relate an account of the peculiar ceremonies re&s;pecting the adoration paid to Cap|tain Cook, it may not be unnece&s;&s;ary to de&s;cribe the <HI>Morai,</HI> already mentioned, &s;ituated on the beach at <HI>Kakooa.</HI> It con&s;i&s;ted of a &s;quare &s;olid pile of &s;tones, of the length of forty yards, the breadth of twenty, and the height of fourteen. The top of it was flat, and a wooden rail &s;ur|rounded it, on which were di&s;played the &s;kulls of tho&s;e natives, who had been &s;acrificed on the death of their chiefs. A ruinous wooden build|ing was &s;ituated in the centre of the area, con|nected with the rail by a &s;tone wall, dividing the whole &s;pace into two parts. Five poles of about twenty feet in height, &s;upported an irregular kind of &s;caffold, on the &s;ide next the country; and,
<PB N="153" REF="030274_0981_0FE5746BC6AEBD38">
on the &s;ide towards the &s;ea, were too &s;mall hou&s;es, with a covered communication.</P>
<P>Koah conducted us to the top of this pile. At our entrance we beheld two large wooden images, with mo&s;t di&s;torted features, having a long piece of wood, proceeding from the top of their heads, of a conical form inverted; the other parts were covered with red cloth. Here Captain Cook was received by a tall young man, having a long beard, who pre&s;ented him to the images, and chanted a kind of hymn, in which he was a&s;&s;i&s;ted by Koah. We were then led to the &s;ide of the Morai where the poles were erected; at the foot of which twelve images were ranged in the form of a &s;emicircle; the middle figure having a high table before it like the <HI>Whatta</HI> of Otaheite, on which we &s;aw a putrid hog, and under it &s;ome cocoa-nuts, plantains, potatoes, bread-fruit, and pieces of &s;ugar-cane. The Commodore was con|ducted under this &s;tand by Koah; who, taking down the hog, held it towards him: when, hav|ing again addre&s;&s;ed him in a long and vehement &s;peech, he &s;uffered it to fall upon the ground, and a&s;cended the &s;caffolding with him, though at the peril of their falling.</P>
<P>We now beheld, advancing in &s;olemn proce&s;|&s;ion, and entering the top of the <HI>Morai,</HI> ten men bearing a live hog, and a piece of large red cloth of con&s;iderable dimen&s;ions. Advancing a few pa|ces, they &s;topped, and pro&s;trated them&s;elves; and
<PB N="154" REF="030274_0982_0FE5744075860E90">
Kaireekeea, the tall young man already mention|ed approaching them, received the cloth, and carried it to Koah, who wrapped it round the Commodore, and made him an offering of the hog.</P>
<P>Captain Cook was now aloft, in a &s;ituation truly whim&s;ical, &s;wathed in red cloth, and hard|ly able to keep his hold in the rotten &s;caffolding. In this &s;ituation he was entertained with the chanting of Koah and Kaireekeea, &s;ometimes in concert, and &s;ometimes alternately. After this office was performed, which was of con&s;iderable duration, Koah let the hog drop, and he and the Commodore immediately de&s;cended. He then conducted him to the images ju&s;t mentioned, to each of which he expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf in a &s;neering tone, &s;napping his fingers at them as he pa&s;&s;ed. He then pre&s;ented him to that in the centre; which, from its being habited in red cloth ap|peared to be in the highe&s;t e&s;timation. He fell pro&s;trate before this figure, and ki&s;&s;ed it, reque&s;t|ing Captain Cook would do the &s;ame; which he readily &s;ubmitted to, being determined to follow Koah's directions throughout the whole of this ceremony.</P>
<P>We were now conveyed into the other divi&s;ion of the Morai, where a &s;pace, of about twelve feet &s;quare, was &s;unk three feet below the level of the area. We de&s;cended into this, and the Commo|dore was immediately &s;eated between two idols;
<PB N="155" REF="030274_0983_0FE5746DA82FD780">
one of his arms being &s;upported by Koah, and Mr. King was reque&s;ted to &s;upport the other. A &s;econd proce&s;&s;ion of natives, at this time, arrived with a baked hog, a pudding, &s;ome cocoa-nuts, bread-fruit, and other vegetables. As they drew near, Kaireekeea placed him&s;elf before them, and pre&s;ented the hog to the Commodore, in the u&s;ual manner; chanting as before, and his companions making regular re&s;pon&s;es. Their &s;peeches and re&s;pon&s;es, we ob&s;erved, grew gradually &s;horter and &s;horter and, towards the conclu&s;ion, Kairee|keea's did not exceed three or four words, which was an&s;wered by the word <HI>orono.</HI></P>
<P>At the conclu&s;ion of this offering, the natives &s;eated them&s;elves fronting us, and began to cut up the baked hog, to break the cocoa-nuts, and to peel the vegetables. Others were employed in brewing the <HI>ava,</HI> by chewing it in the &s;ame manner as at the Friendly I&s;lands. Kaireekeea then chewed part of the kernel of a cocoa-nut, and wrapped it in a piece of cloth, with which he rubbed the Captain's head, face, hands, arms, and &s;houlders. The <HI>ava</HI> was afterwards handed round, and when we had all ta&s;ted it, Koah and Pareea pulled the fle&s;h of the hog in pieces, and proceeded to put &s;ome of it into our mouths. Mr. King had no particular objection to being fed by Pareea, who was remarkably cleanly in his per&s;on; but Captain Cook, to whom a piece was pre&s;ented by Koah, could not &s;wallow a mor&s;el,
<PB N="156" REF="030274_0984_0FE5744269E31948">
the putrid hog being &s;trong in his recollection; and as the old man, from motives of civility, had chewed it for him, his reluctance was much in|crea&s;ed.</P>
<P>This ceremony being concluded, we quitted the <HI>Morai,</HI> after di&s;tributing among the populace &s;ome pieces of iron, and other articles, with which they were much delighted. We were then conducted in proce&s;&s;ion to the boats; the men, with wands, attending, and pronouncing &s;enten|ces as before. Mo&s;t of the natives again retired, and the remaining few pro&s;trated them&s;elves as we pa&s;&s;ed along the &s;hore.</P>
<P>We went immediately on board, full of the idea of what we had &s;een, and perfectly &s;atisfied with the hone&s;t di&s;po&s;itions of our new friends. Of the &s;ingularity and novelty of the various ceremonies performed upon this occa&s;ion, we can only form conjectures; but they were certainly, highly expre&s;&s;ive of re&s;pect on the part of the inhabitants; and, as far as related to the Com|modore, they approached to adoration.</P>
<P>Mr. King went on &s;hore, the next morning, with a guard of eight marines; having received orders to erect the ob&s;ervatory in a proper &s;itua|tion; by which means the waterers, and other working parties, on &s;hore, might be &s;uperintend|ed and protected. Ob&s;erving a convenient &s;pot for this purpo&s;e, almo&s;t in the centre of the vil|lage, Pareea immediately offered to exerci&s;e his
<PB N="157" REF="030274_0985_0FE5740D7A137A38">
power in our behalf, and propo&s;ed that &s;ome hou&s;es &s;hould be taken down, that our ob&s;erva|tions might not be ob&s;tructed. This generous offer, however, we declined, and we made choice of a potatoe field, adjoining to the <HI>Morai,</HI> which was granted us mo&s;t readily; and to prevent the intru&s;ion of the natives, the place was con&s;ecrated by the prie&s;ts, by placing their wands round the walls which inclo&s;ed it.</P>
<P>This interdiction the natives call <HI>taboo,</HI> a term frequently repeated by the&s;e i&s;landers, and &s;eemed to be a word of exten&s;ive operation. In this in|&s;tance, it procured us more privacy than we could have wi&s;hed. No canoes attempted to land near us; the natives only &s;at on the wall, not daring to come within the <HI>tabooed</HI> &s;pace without obtain|ing our permi&s;&s;ion. The men, indeed, at our re|que&s;t, would bring provi&s;ions into the field; but our utmo&s;t endeavours were ineffectual to induce the women to approach us. Pre&s;ents were tried, but without &s;ucce&s;s. Attempts were made to prevail on Pereea and Koah to bring them, but to no purpo&s;e; the <HI>Eatooa</HI> and Terreeoboo, they &s;aid, would kill them if they did.</P>
<P>This circum&s;tance afforded great amu&s;ement to our friends on board, whither multitudes of people (particularly women) continually flocked; in&s;omuch that they were frequently obliged to clear the ve&s;&s;el, in order to have room to per|form their nece&s;&s;ary duties. Two or three hun|dred
<PB N="158" REF="030274_0986_0FE5744801D1BE78">
women were &s;ometimes obliged to jump, at once, into the water; where they continued to &s;wim and play till they could be re-admitted.</P>
<P>Pareea and Koah left us on the 19th of Janua|ry, in order to attend Terreeoboo, who had landed on a di&s;tant part of the i&s;land; and no|thing material happened on board till the 24th. The caulkers were employed on the &s;ides of the &s;hips, and the rigging was repaired. The &s;alting of hogs was al&s;o a principal object of the Com|modore's attention; and as we had improved in this operation &s;ince the former voyages, a detail of the proce&s;s of it may not be thought improper.</P>
<P>To cure the fle&s;h of animals, in tropical cli|mates, by &s;alting, has long been thought imprac|ticable; putrefaction making &s;o rapid a progre&s;s as not to allow the &s;alt to take effect before the meat gets tainted. Captain Cook appears to be the fir&s;t navigator who has attempted to make experiments relative to this bu&s;ine&s;s. His fir&s;t attempts in 1774, in his &s;econd voyage to the Pacific Ocean, &s;o far &s;ucceeded, as to convince him of the error of the general opinion. As his pre&s;ent voyage was likely to be protracted a year beyond the time that provi&s;ions had been &s;up|plied for the &s;hips, he was obliged to contrive &s;ome method of procuring &s;ub&s;i&s;tence for the crews, or relinqui&s;h the pro&s;ecution of his di&s;|coveries. He, therefore, renewed his attempts,
<PB N="159" REF="030274_0987_0FE5740F60828668">
and his mo&s;t &s;anguine expectations were com|pletely an&s;wered.</P>
<P>The hogs we cured were of various &s;izes from four to ten or twelve &s;tone, fourteen pound to the &s;tone. They were always &s;laughtered in the after|noon; and, after &s;calding off the hair, and re|moving the entrails, the hog was cut into pieces, from four to eight pounds each, and the bones taken out of the legs and chine: in the larger &s;ort, the ribs were al&s;o taken out. The pieces were then carefully examined and wiped, and the coagulated blood taken from the veins. After this they were given to the &s;alters whil&s;t they con|tinued warm, and, when they were well rubbed with &s;alt, placed in a heap on a &s;tage in the open air, covered with planks, and pre&s;&s;ed with very heavy weights. The next evening they were again well wiped and examined, when the &s;u&s;picious parts were taken away. This done, they were put into a tub of &s;trong pickle, after which they were examined once or twice a day; and, if it happened that any piece had not taken the &s;alt, which might be di&s;covered by the &s;mell of the pickle, they were in&s;tantly taken out and exa|mined again, the &s;ound pieces being put into fre&s;h pickle. This however, did not often hap|pen. At the end of &s;ix days they were examined for the la&s;t time; and, after being &s;lightly pre&s;|&s;ed, they were put into barrels, having a thin layer of &s;alt between them. Mr. King brought
<PB N="160" REF="030274_0988_0FE57449CB1DE6C8">
home &s;ome barrels of this pork, that had been pickled at Owhyhee, in January 1779, which was ta&s;ted here, by &s;everal per&s;ons, about Chri&s;tmas, 1780, who declared it to be perfectly &s;ound and whole&s;ome.</P>
<P>But to return from this digre&s;&s;ion. We had not been long &s;ettled at the ob&s;ervatory, before we di&s;covered the habitation of a &s;ociety of prie&s;ts, who had excited our curio&s;ity by their re|gular attendance on the <HI>morai.</HI> Their huts were erected round a pond, enclo&s;ed within a grove of cocoa-trees, by which they were &s;eperated from the beach and the village, and gave the &s;ituation an air of religious retirement. Captain Cook being made acquainted with the&s;e circum&s;tances, he was determined to vi&s;it them; and expecting the manner of his reception would be &s;ingular, he took Mr. Webber with him, to enable him to repre&s;ent the ceremony in a drawing.</P>
<P>When he arrived at the beach, he was con|ducted to <HI>Harre-no-Orono,</HI> or the hou&s;e of Orono. On his approaching this &s;acred place, he was &s;eated at the foot of a wooden idol, re&s;embling tho&s;e which he had &s;een at the <HI>morai.</HI> Here Mr. King again &s;upported one of his arms. He was then arrayed in red cloth, and Kaireekeea, a&s;&s;i&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|ed by twelve prie&s;ts, pre&s;ented a pig with the u&s;ual &s;olemnities. After this ceremony, the pig was &s;trangled, and thrown into the embers of a fire, prepared for that purpo&s;e. When the hair
<PB N="161" REF="030274_0989_0FE57414A4933090">
was &s;igned off, a &s;econd offering was made, and the chanting repeated as before; after which, the dead pig was held, for &s;ome time, under Cap|tain Cook's no&s;e; and then laid, with a cocoa-nut at his feet. This part of the ceremony be|ing concluded, the performers &s;at down; and the <HI>ava</HI> was brewed and handed about; a baked hog was brought in, and we were fed, as in the former ceremony.</P>
<P>While we continued on the bay, whenever the Commodore came on &s;hore, he was preceded by one of the&s;e prie&s;ts, who proclaimed the landing of the <HI>Orono,</HI> and ordered the inhabitants to pro&s;|trate them&s;elves. He was con&s;tantly attended by the &s;ame per&s;on, on the water, where he was &s;ta|tioned in the bow of the boat, having a wand in his hand, to give notice of his approach to the natives, who where in canoes; on which they in|&s;tantly cea&s;ed paddling, and fell on their faces till he had pa&s;&s;ed. Whenever he vi&s;ited the ob|&s;ervatory. Kairkeereea and his a&s;&s;i&s;tants pre&s;ented them&s;elves before him, making an offering of hogs, bread-fruit, cocoa-nuts, &amp;c. with the ac|cu&s;tomed &s;olemnities. Upon the&s;e occa&s;ions, &s;ome of the inferior chiefs entreated permi&s;&s;ion to make an offering to the <HI>Orono.</HI> If their re|que&s;t was complied with, they pre&s;ented the hog them&s;elves; in the performance of which, their countenances di&s;played that they were greatly impre&s;&s;ed with awe and terror. Kaireekeea, and

the prie&s;ts a&s;&s;i&s;ted, and accompanied the ceremony with their accu&s;tomed hymns.</P>
<P>But their civilities extended beyond parade and ceremony; our party, on &s;hore, were daily &s;up|plied by them with hogs and vegetables, &s;ufficient for our &s;ub&s;i&s;tance, and to &s;pare; and canoes, laden with provi&s;ions, were as regularly &s;ent off to the &s;hips. Nothing was demanded in return, nor was the mo&s;t di&s;tant hint ever given that any com|pen&s;ation was expected. Their manner of con|ferring favours, appeared more like the di&s;charge of a religious duty, than to re&s;ult from mere libe|rality. On a&s;king to whom we were indebted for all this munificence, we were informed, that it was at the expence of Kaoo, the chief prie&s;t, and grandfather to Kaireekeea, who was then in the &s;uit of the &s;overeign of the i&s;land.</P>
<P>We had, indeed, le&s;s rea&s;on to be &s;atisfied with the behaviour of the warrior chiefs, than with that of the prie&s;ts. In our intercour&s;e with the former, they were always &s;ufficiently attentive to their own intere&s;ts; and, be&s;ides their propen&s;ity to &s;tealing, which may admit of palliation from its univer&s;ality in the&s;e &s;eas, they had other ar|tifices equally di&s;honourable. The following is one in&s;tance, in which we di&s;covered, with re|gret, that our good friend Koah was a party prin|cipally concerned.</P>
<P>The chiefs, who made us pre&s;ents of hogs, were always generou&s;ly rewarded; in con&s;equence
<PB N="163" REF="030274_0991_0FE574165FABA2B0">
of which, we were &s;upplied with more than we could con&s;ume. On the&s;e occa&s;ions Koah, who con&s;tantly attended us, u&s;ually petitioned for tho&s;e that we did not ab&s;olutely want, and they were given to him of cour&s;e. A pig was, one day, pre&s;ented to us by a man whom Koah intro|duced as a chief; which we knew to be the pig that had, a &s;hort time before been given to Koah. Su&s;pecting we had been impo&s;ed upon, we found, on further enquiry, that the pretended chief was one of the common people; and from other con|current circum&s;tances, we were perfectly con|vinced that, in many in&s;tances, we had been the dupes of &s;imilar impo&s;ition.</P>
<P>On Sunday the 24th, we were now a little &s;ur|prized to find, that no canoes were permitted to put off, and that the natives confined them&s;elves to their hou&s;es. At length, however, we were in|formed, that the bay was <HI>tabooed,</HI> and that all in|tercour&s;e with us was interdicted, oh account of the arrival of Terreeoboo their king. Not appre|hending an accident of this kind, the &s;hips were deprived of their u&s;ual &s;upply of vegetables.</P>
<P>On Monday the 25th, in the morning, we en|deavoured, by threats and promi&s;es, to induce the inhabitants to approach us. At length, &s;ome of them were venturing to put off, and a chief was ob&s;erved to be very active in driving them away. In order to make him de&s;i&s;t, a mu&s;quet was in&s;tantly fired over his head, which operated
<PB N="164" REF="030274_0992_0FE5744D5FC0DC48">
as it was intended, and refre&s;hments were &s;oon after to be had as u&s;ual. In the afternoon, the &s;hips were privately vi&s;ited by Terreeoboo, at|tended only by one canoe, which had his wife and family on board. After &s;taying till almo&s;t ten o'clock, he returned to the village of Kow|rowa.</P>
<P>About noon the next day, the king, in a large canoe, with &s;ome attendants in two others, pad|dled from the village, in great &s;tate, towards the &s;hips. Their appearance was noble and mag|nificent. Terreeoboo, and his chiefs, were in the fir&s;t canoe, arrayed in feathered cloaks and helmets, and armed with &s;pears and daggers. In the &s;econd, came Kaoo, the chief prie&s;t, together with h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s brethern, having their idols di&s;played on red cloth. The&s;e idols were figures of an enormous &s;ize, made of wicker-work, and curi|ou&s;ly ornamented with &s;mall feathers of a variety of colours. Their eyes were large pearl oy&s;ters, with a black nut placed in the centre; a double row of the fangs of dogs was fixed in each of their mouths, which, as well as the re&s;t of their features appeared &s;trangely di&s;torted. The third canoe was laden with hogs and vegetables. As they advanced, the prie&s;ts, in the &s;econ canoe, chanted their hymns with great &s;olemnity. Af|ter paddling round the ve&s;&s;els, they did not come on board, as we expected, but made immedi|ately

towards the &s;hore, at the beach where we were &s;tationed.</P>
<P>When Mr. King beheld them approaching, he ordered our little guard to receive the king; and Captain Cook, &s;eeing that he intended to go on &s;hore, went thither al&s;o, and landed almo&s;t at the &s;ame in&s;tant. We u&s;hered them into the tent, and the king had hardly been &s;eated, when he ro&s;e up, and gracefully threw over the Cap|tain's &s;houlders, the rich feathered cloak that he him&s;elf wore, placed a helmet on his head, and pre&s;ented him with a curious fan. Five or &s;ix other cloaks, of great beauty and value, were &s;pread at the Commodore's feet.</P>
<P>Four hogs were then brought forward, by the king's attendants, together with bread-fruit, co|coa-nuts, and &s;ugar-canes. Then followed the ceremony of Terreeoboo's changing names with Captain Cook; the &s;tronge&s;t pledge of friend|&s;hip among all the i&s;landers of the Pacific Ocean. A &s;olemn proce&s;&s;ion now advanced, con&s;i&s;ting of prie&s;ts, preceded by a venerable old per&s;onage, followed by a train of people leading large hogs; others being laden with potatoes, plantains, &amp;c. We could in&s;tantly perceive, by the countenance and ge&s;tures of Kaireekeea, that the old man who headed the proce&s;&s;ion, was the chief prie&s;t, on who&s;e bounty we were told we had &s;o long &s;ub|&s;i&s;ted. He wrapped a piece of red cloth round the &s;houlders of Captain Cook, and, in the u&s;ual
<PB N="166" REF="030274_0995_0FE57453145F0AC8">
form pre&s;ented him with a pig. He was then &s;eated next the king, and Kaireekeea, and his at|tendants began their vocal ceremonies, Kaoo and the chiefs a&s;&s;i&s;ting in the re&s;pon&s;es.</P>
<P>In the per&s;on of this king, we were &s;urprized to recognize the &s;ame emaciated old man, who came on board the Re&s;olution, from the north-ea&s;t &s;ide of the i&s;land of Mowee; and we per|ceived, that &s;everal of his attendants were the &s;ame per&s;ons, who, at that time, continued with us the whole night. Among the&s;e were the king's two younge&s;t &s;ons, the elde&s;t about the age of &s;ixteen; and Maiha-Maiha, his nephew, whom we could not immediately recollect, having had his hair pla&s;tered over with a dirty pa&s;te and pow|der, which was no bad improvement to the mo&s;t &s;avage countenance we had ever &s;een.</P>
<P>The formalities of the meeting being ended, Captain Cook conducted Terreeoboo, and &s;eve|ral of his chiefs, on board the Re&s;olution. They were received with every po&s;&s;ible attention and re&s;pect; and the Commodore as a compen&s;ation for the feathered cloak, put a linen &s;hirt upon the &s;overeign, and girt his own hanger round him. Kaoo, and about half a dozen other ancient chiefs, remained on &s;hore.</P>
<P>All this time, not a canoe was permitted to appear in the bay, and tho&s;e natives who did not confine them&s;elves to their huts, lay pro&s;trate on the ground. Before the king quitted the Re&s;o|lution,
<PB N="167" REF="030274_0996_0FE5741E8489AEA0">
he granted leave for the natives to trade with the &s;hips, as u&s;ual; but the women (we know not upon what account) were &s;till interdict|ed by the <HI>taboo;</HI> that is, to remain at home, and not have any kind of intercour&s;e with us.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE behaviour of the inhabitants was &s;o civil and inoffen&s;ive, that all apprehen&s;ions of danger were totally vani&s;hed. We tru&s;ted our|&s;elves
<PB N="168" REF="030274_0997_0FE57454B4415990">
among&s;t them at all times, and upon all occa&s;ions, without the lea&s;t he&s;itation. The of|ficers ventured frequently up the country, either &s;ingly, or in &s;mall parties, and &s;ometimes con|tinued out the whole night. To relate all the in&s;tances of genero&s;ity and civility, which we ex|perienced upon the&s;e occa&s;ions, would require volumes. In all places the people flocked about us, anxious to afford every a&s;&s;i&s;tance in their power, and appeared highly gratified if we con|de&s;cended to accept of their &s;ervices. Variety of innocent arts were practi&s;ed to attract our notice, or to delay our departure. The boys and girls ran through their villages before us, &s;topping us at every opening, where there was a commodious place to form a group for dancing. We were, at one time, &s;olicited to take a draught of the milk of cocoa-nuts, or accept of &s;uch other refre&s;hment as their huts afforded; at another we were en|circled by a company of young women, who ex|erted their &s;kill and agility in amu&s;ing us with &s;ongs and dances.</P>
<P>But though their gentlene&s;s and ho&s;pitality were plea&s;ing to us, they were addicted to &s;teal|ing, like all the other i&s;landers of the&s;e &s;eas. This was a di&s;tre&s;&s;ing circum&s;tance, and &s;ometimes obliged us to exerci&s;e &s;everity, which we &s;hould have been happy to have avoided, if it had not been e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary. Some expert &s;wim|mers were one day detected under the &s;hips, draw|ing
<PB N="169" REF="030274_0998_0FE57420907224E0">
out the filling nails from the &s;heathing, which they ingeniou&s;ly performed with a flint &s;tone, fa&s;tened to the end of a &s;hort &s;tick. This practice was &s;o injurious to our ve&s;&s;els, that we fired &s;mall &s;hot at the offenders; but that they ea&s;ily evad|ed, by diving under the &s;hips bottom, It there|fore became highly nece&s;&s;ary to make an example of one of them, by flogging him on board the Di&s;covery.</P>
<P>A large party of gentlemen, from both &s;hips, &s;et out, about this time, on an excur&s;ion into the country, in order to examine its natural pro|ductions; an account of which will be hereafter given. At pre&s;ent, however, we &s;hall ob&s;erve, that it afforded Kaoo a fre&s;h opportunity of ex|erci&s;ing his civility and genero&s;ity. No &s;ooner was he informed of their departure, than he &s;ent after them a large quantity of provi&s;ions, with or|ders, that every attention and a&s;&s;i&s;tance &s;hould be granted them by the inhabitants of tho&s;e di&s;tricts through which they were to pa&s;s. His conduct, on this occa&s;ion, was &s;o delicate and di&s;intere&s;ted, that even the people he employed were not per|mitted to accept of the &s;malle&s;t pre&s;ent. At the end of &s;ix days, the gentlemen returned, without having penetrated more than twenty miles into the i&s;land; owing partly to improper guides, and partly to the impracticability of the country.</P>
<P>On the 27th, the Re&s;olution's rudder was un|hung, and &s;ent on &s;hore, in order to undergo a
<PB N="170" REF="030274_0999_0FE574563AA780C0">
thorough repair. The carpenters at the &s;ame time, where &s;ent into the country, under the guidance of &s;ome of Kaoo's people, to get planks for the head rail work, which was become rotten and decayed.</P>
<P>Captain Clerke, who was generally confined on board by ill health, paid Terreeoboo his fir&s;t vi&s;it on the 28th, at his habitation on &s;hore. The ceremonies ob&s;erved with Captain Cook, were performed in honour of Captain Clerke; and, on his return, he received a pre&s;ent of thirty large hogs, and &s;uch a quantity of vegetables as could not be con&s;umed, by his crew, in le&s;s than a week. This was the more extraordinary, as it was quite an unexpected vi&s;it.</P>
<P>Not having &s;een any of their &s;ports or exerci&s;es, the natives, at our particular reque&s;t, entertained us in the evening with a boxing match. Though the&s;e games were inferior, in every re&s;pect, to tho&s;e we had &s;een exhibited at the Friendly I&s;lands; yet, as they were &s;omewhat different, a &s;hort account of them may not be thought impro|per.</P>
<P>A va&s;t concour&s;e of people a&s;&s;embled on an even &s;pot of ground, not far di&s;tant from our tents. A long vacant &s;pace was left in the centre of them, at the upper end of which the judges pre|&s;ided, under three &s;tandards. Slips of cloth, of various colours, were pendent from the&s;e &s;tand|ards; as were the &s;kins of two wild gee&s;e, &s;ome &s;mall birds, and a few bunches of feathers.</P>
<P><PB N="171" REF="030274_1000_0FE57422153AF790">The &s;ports being ready to begin, the judges gave the &s;ignal, and two combatants appeared in view. They advanced &s;lowly, drawing up their feet very high behind and rubbing their hands upon the &s;oles. As they came forward, they frequently &s;urveyed each other from head to foot, with an air of contempt, looking archly at the &s;pectators di&s;torting their features, and practi&s;ing a variety of unnatural ge&s;tures. When they were advanced within the reach of each other, they held both arms &s;traight out before their faces, at which part they always aimed their blows. They &s;truck with a full &s;wing of the arm, which to us had a very awkward appearance. They did not attempt to parry; but endeavoured to elude their adver&s;ary's attack, by &s;topping, or retreating. The battle was expeditiou&s;ly decided; for if either of them fell, whether by accident, or from a blow he was deemed vanqui&s;hed; and the victor expre&s;&s;ed his triumph by a variety of &s;trange ge&s;tures, which u&s;ually excited a loud laugh a|mong the &s;pectators, for which purpo&s;e it &s;eemed to be calculated. The &s;ucce&s;sful combatant waited for a &s;econd antagoni&s;t; and, if again victorious, for a third; and &s;o on, till he was at la&s;t defeated.</P>
<P>It was very &s;ingular, in the&s;e combats, that when any two were preparing to attack each other, a third may advance, and make choice of either of them for his antagoni&s;t, when the other is un|der
<PB N="172" REF="030274_1001_0FE57458201B7798">
the nece&s;&s;ity of withdrawing. If the comba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> proved long and tedious, or appeared unequal, a chief generally interfered, and concluded it by putting a &s;tick between the combatants. As this exhibition was at our de&s;ire, it was univer&s;ally expected that &s;ome of us would have engaged with the natives; but, though our people re|ceived pre&s;&s;ing invitations to bear a part, they did not hearken to the challenges, not having forgot the blows they received at the Friendly I&s;lands.</P>
<P>William Whatman, a &s;eaman of the gunner's crew, died this day; this event is more par|ticularly mentioned, as death had hitherto been uncommon among&s;t us. He was a man in years, and much re&s;pected for his attachment to Cap|tain Cook. He had &s;erved twenty-one years as a marine, and then entered as a &s;eaman in 1772, on board the Re&s;olution, and &s;erved with the Commodore in his voyage towards the &s;outh pole. On their return, he got admittance into Green|wich Ho&s;pital, through the intere&s;t of Captain Cook, at the &s;ame time with him&s;elf; and, anxi|ous to follow the fortunes of his benefactor, he al&s;o quitted it with him, on his appointment to the command of the pre&s;ent expedition. He had been often &s;ubject to &s;light fevers, in the cour&s;e of the voyage, and was infirm when we arrived in the bay; where, having been &s;ent for a few days on &s;hore, he thought him&s;elf perfectly re|&s;tored,
<PB N="173" REF="030274_1002_0FE5742927C25458">
and reque&s;ted to return on board. Hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> reque&s;t was complied with; but the day follow|ing he had a &s;troke of the pal&s;y, which, in two days afterwards, put a period to his life.</P>
<P>At the reque&s;t of Terreeoboo, the remains of this hone&s;t &s;eaman were buried on the <HI>morai;</HI> the ceremony being performed with great &s;olemnity. Kaoo and his brethren were pre&s;ent at the fune|ral, who behaved with great decorum, and paid due attention while the &s;ervice was performing. On our beginning to fill up the grave, they ap|proached it with great awe, and threw in a dead pig, together with &s;ome cocoa-nuts and plan|tains. For three &s;ucce&s;&s;ive nights they &s;urround|ed it, &s;acrificing hogs, and reciting hymns and prayers till morning.</P>
<P>We erected a po&s;t at the head of the grave, and nailed thereon a piece of board; on which was in&s;cribed the name and age of the decea&s;ed, and the day of his departure from this life. The&s;e they a&s;&s;ured us they would not remove, and they will probably be permitted to remain, &s;o long as &s;uch frail materials can endure.</P>
<P>Our &s;hips were much in want of fuel, there|fore Captain Cook de&s;ired Mr. King to treat with the prie&s;ts for the purcha&s;e of the rail on the <HI>morai.</HI> Mr. King had his doubts about the de|cency of this overture, and apprehended that the bare mention of it might be deemed impious; but in this he was exceedingly mi&s;taken. They
<PB N="174" REF="030274_1003_0FE575D6F0470A10">
expre&s;&s;ed no kind of &s;urprize at the application, and the wood was delivered without the lea&s;t &s;ti|pulation. Whil&s;t our people were taking it away, he &s;aw one of them with a carved image; and, upon inquiry, was informed that the whole &s;emi|circle (as mentioned in the de&s;cription of the <HI>morai</HI>) had been carried to the boats.</P>
<P>Though the natives were &s;pectators of this bu|&s;ine&s;s, they did not &s;eem to re&s;ent it; but, on the contrary, had even a&s;&s;i&s;ted in the removal. Mr. King thought proper to mention the parti|culars to Kaoo: who &s;eemed exceedingly indif|ferent about the matter, begging him only to re|&s;tore the center image; which was immediately done, and it was conveyed to one of the prie&s;t's hou&s;es.</P>
<P>The king, and his chiefs, had, for &s;ome time, been very importunate to know the time of our departure. Mr. King's curio&s;ity was excited, from this circum&s;tance, to know the opinion the&s;e people had entertained of us, and what they &s;up|po&s;ed to be the objects of our voyage. He took con&s;iderable pains to &s;atisfy him&s;elf on the&s;e points: but the only information he could get was, that they &s;uppo&s;ed we had left our native country on account of the &s;cantine&s;s of provi&s;i|ons, and that we had vi&s;ited them for the &s;ole purpo&s;e of filling our bellies. This conclu&s;ion was natural enough, con&s;idering the meagre ap|pearance of &s;ome of our crew, the voracity with
<PB N="175" REF="030274_1004_0FE57530D2FE8C80">
which we devoured their fre&s;h provi&s;ions, and our anxiety to purcha&s;e as much of it as we were able. One circum&s;tance may be added to the&s;e, which puzzled them exceedingly; that of our having no women with us.</P>
<P>It was matter of entertainment to &s;ee the na|tives patting the bellies of the &s;ailors (who were much improved in &s;leekne&s;s &s;ince their arrival at the bay) and telling them, in the be&s;t manner they could, that it was time for them to depart; but, if they would return the next bread-fruit &s;ea&s;on, they &s;hould be better able to &s;upply them. We had now continued &s;ixteen days in the bay, during which time our con&s;umption of hogs and vegetables had been &s;o enormous, that we need not be &s;urprized at their wi&s;hing to &s;ee us take our leave. But Terreeoboo had, perhaps, no other view, in his enquiries, than a de&s;ire of hav|ing &s;ufficient notice, to prepare &s;uitable pre&s;ents for us at our departure; for when we informed him of our intention to quit the i&s;land in two days, a kind of proclamation was immediately made, requiring the natives to bring in their hogs and vegetables, for Terreeoboo to pre&s;ent to the <HI>Orono.</HI></P>
<P>At the beach, we were this day much enter|tained, with the buffooneries of one of the natives. In his hand he held an in&s;trument of mu&s;ic, &s;uch as we have already de&s;cribed; bits of &s;ea-weed were fa&s;tened round his neck; and, round each
<PB N="176" REF="030274_1005_0FE548DB218E6888">
leg, &s;ome &s;trong netting; on which were fixed &s;ome rows of dogs teeth, hanging loo&s;e. His dancing was accompanied with &s;trange grimaces, and unnatural di&s;tortions of the features: which, though &s;ometimes highly ridiculous, was, upon the whole, without meaning or expre&s;&s;ion. Mr. Webber made a drawing of this per&s;on; the man|ner in which the maro is tied; the figure of the in|&s;trument, and of the ornaments round the legs.</P>
<P>Wre&s;tling and boxing matches afforded us di|ver&s;ion for the evening; and we, in return, exhi|bited the few fire-works we had remaining. No|thing could more effectually excite the admira|tion of the&s;e i&s;landers, or &s;trike them with more exalted ideas of our &s;uperioity, than &s;uch a re|pre&s;entation. Though this was, in every re&s;pect, much inferior to that at Hapaee, yet the a&s;toni&s;h|ment of the people was equally great.</P>
<P>The carpenters which had been &s;ent up the country, to cut planks for the head rail-work of the Re&s;olution, had now been gone three days; and, not having heard from them, we began to be alarmed for their &s;afety. We expre&s;&s;ed our apprehen&s;ions to old Kaoo, who appeared equally concerned with our&s;elves; but while we were planning mea&s;ures with him, for &s;ending proper per&s;ons after them, they all &s;afely arrived. They went farther into the country than they expected, before they found any trees &s;uitable for their pur|po&s;e. This circum&s;tance, together with the bad|ne&s;s
<PB N="177" REF="030274_1006_0FE575327A156668">
of the roads, and the difficulty of conveying the timber to the &s;hips, had &s;o long detained them. They be&s;towed high commendations on their guides, who not only &s;upplied them with provi&s;ions, but faithfully protected their tools.</P>
<P>The 4th of February being fixed for our de|parture, Terreeoboo invited Captain Cook and Mr. King, to attend him on the 3d, to Kaoo's re&s;idence. On our arrival there we &s;aw large quantities of cloth lie &s;cattered on the ground; abundance of red and yellow feathers, fa&s;tened to the fibres of cocoa-nut hu&s;ks; and plenty of hatchets and iron ware, which had been received from us in barter. Not far from the&s;e was de|po&s;ited an immen&s;e quantity of various kinds of vegetables; and, at a little di&s;tance, a large herd of hogs. We &s;uppo&s;ed, at the fir&s;t, that the whole was intended as a pre&s;ent for us; but we were informed by Kaireekeea, that it was a tribute to the king, from the inhabitants of that di&s;trict. And, we were no &s;ooner &s;eated, than the bundles were brought, and laid &s;everally at Terreeoboo's feet, and the cloth, feathers, and iron, were di&s;played before him.</P>
<P>The king was perfectly &s;atisfied with this mark of duty from his people; and &s;elected about a third of the iron uten&s;ils, a third of the feathers, and &s;ome pieces of cloth; he ordered the&s;e to be &s;et a&s;ide by them&s;elves; and the remainder of the cloth, hogs, vegetables, &amp;c. were afterwards pre|&s;ented
<PB N="178" REF="030274_1007_0FE574F86844DE50">
to Captain Cook and Mr. King. The value and magnitude of this pre&s;ent, far exceed|ed any thing that we had met with. The whole was immediately conveyed on board. The large hogs were &s;elected, in order to be &s;alted for &s;ea &s;tore; but the &s;maller pigs, and the vegetables, were divided between the crews.</P>
<P>We left the <HI>morai,</HI> and got our ob&s;ervatories on board. The <HI>taboo</HI> was removed, and, with it, its magical effects. As &s;oon as we had quit|ted the place, the people ru&s;hed in, and vigilantly &s;earched; hoping to find &s;ome valuable articles left behind. Mr. King being the la&s;t on &s;hore, and waiting for the return of the boat, the inha|bitants crowded about him, and having prevailed on him to &s;it down among them, expre&s;&s;ed their regret at our &s;eperation. It was even with dif|ficulty that they would &s;uffer him to depart. He was, indeed, highly e&s;teemed among them, as will appear from the following relation.</P>
<P>Having had, while we were in the bay, the command of the party on &s;hore, he became more acquainted with the natives, and they with him, than tho&s;e who were required to be on board. He experienced great kindne&s;s and civility from the inhabitants in general, but the friend&s;hip &s;hewn by the prie&s;ts was con&s;tant and unbounded.</P>
<P>He was anxious to conciliate their e&s;teem: in which he &s;o happily &s;ucceeded, that, when they were acquainted with the time of our departure,
<PB N="179" REF="030274_1008_0FE575389CD0B968">
he was urged to remain behind, and received overtures of the mo&s;t flattering kind. When he endeavoured to excu&s;e him&s;elf, by alledging, that Captain Cook would not permit it, they propo&s;ed to conduct him to the mountains, and there con|ceal him till the departure of the &s;hips. On Mr. King's a&s;&s;uring them, that the Captain would not &s;ail without him, the king and Kaoo repair|ed to Captain Cook, (whom they &s;uppo&s;ed to be his father) formally reque&s;ting that he might be &s;uffered to remain behind. The Commodore, unwilling to give a po&s;itive refu&s;al, to a propo&s;al &s;o generou&s;ly intended, a&s;&s;ured them, that he could not then part with him; but he &s;hould re|turn thither the next year, when he would in|deavour to oblige them.</P>
<P>On Thur&s;day the 4th of February, early in the morning, we unmoored, and the Re&s;olution and Di&s;covery &s;ailed out of the bay; attended by a va&s;t number of canoes. It was Captain Cook's intention to fini&s;h the &s;urvey of Owhyhee, before he went to the other i&s;lands, hoping to meet with a road more &s;heltered than Karakakooa Bay; and, if he &s;hould not &s;ucceed here, he meant to examine the &s;outh-ea&s;t part of Mowee, where he had been informed, there was a mo&s;t excellent harbour.</P>
<P>On the 5th, and the following, day, we had calm weather, and con&s;equently our progre&s;s was but &s;low. A great number of the natives fol|lowed
<PB N="180" REF="030274_1009_0FE574F9F0523D40">
us in their canoes; and Terreeoboo gave an additional proof of his e&s;teem for the Commo|dore, by &s;ending after him a large pre&s;ent of hogs and vegetables.</P>
<P>Having a little breeze, in the night of the 5th of February, we made &s;ome progre&s;s to the north|ward; and on the 6th, in the morning, we were abrea&s;t of a deep bay, which the natives call Toe-yah-yah. We flattered our&s;elves with hopes of finding a commodious harbour in this bay, as we &s;aw &s;ome fine &s;treams of water to the north-ea&s;t; and the whole appeared to be well &s;helter|ed. The&s;e ob&s;ervations &s;eeming to tally with the accounts given us by Koah, who now accompa|nied Captain Cook, the Ma&s;ter was &s;ent in the pinnace, with Koah as his guide, to ob&s;erve and examine the bay; Koah having fir&s;t altered his name, out of compliment to us, to that of Bri|tannee.</P>
<P>The weather became gloomy in the afternoon, and &s;uch violent gu&s;ts of wind blew off the land, that we were obliged to take in all the &s;ails, and bring too, under the mizen-&s;tay-&s;ail. The canoes all left us as &s;oon as the gale began; and Mr. Bligh, on his return, pre&s;erved an old woman and two men from drowning, who&s;e canoes had been over&s;et in the &s;torm. We had &s;everal wo|men remaining on board, whom the natives, in their hurry to depart, had left to &s;hift for them|&s;elves.</P>
<P><PB N="181" REF="030274_1010_0FE5753A239CED98">Mr. Bligh reported, that he had landed at a village on the north &s;ide of the bay, where he was &s;hewn &s;ome wells of water, that would not, by any means, an&s;wer our purpo&s;e; that he pro|ceeded further into the bay; where, in&s;tead of meeting with good anchorage, he found the &s;hores were low, and a flat bed of coral rocks extended a long the coa&s;t&punc; and upwards of a mile from the land; the depth of water, on the out&s;ide, being twenty fathoms. During this &s;urvey, Britannee had contrived to &s;lip away, being, perhaps, afraid of returning, as his information had proved erroneous.</P>
<P>The weather became more moderate in the evening, and we again made &s;ail; but it blew &s;o violently about midnight, as to &s;plit the fore and main-top-&s;ails. We bent fre&s;h &s;ails in the morn|ing of the 7th, and had a light breeze, and fair weather. Being now about four or five leagues from the &s;hore, and the weather very un&s;ettled, the canoes would not venture off, &s;o that our gue&s;ts were under the nece&s;&s;ity of remaining with us, though much again&s;t their inclination; for they were all exceedingly &s;ea-&s;ick, and many of them had left their infants on &s;hore.</P>
<P>Though the weather continued &s;qually, we &s;tood in for the land in the afternoon; and, being within three leagues of it, we &s;aw two men in a canoe, paddling towards us. We naturally con|jectured that they had been driven off the &s;hore,
<PB N="182" REF="030274_1011_0FE574FBE0807AF8">
by the late violent gale; and &s;topped the &s;hip's way, in order to take them in. They were &s;o ex|hau&s;ted with fatigue, that had not one of the na|tives on board jumped into the canoe to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, they would hardly have been able to fix it to the rope thrown out for that purpo&s;e. With difficulty, however, we got them up the &s;hip's &s;ide, together with a child about four years of age, which had been la&s;hed under the thwarts of the canoe with only its head above the water. They informed us, that they had quitted the land the morning before, &s;ince which time they had not had food or water. Provi&s;ion was given them with the u&s;ual precautions, and the child entru&s;ted to the care of one of the women; and, the next morning, they were all perfectly reco|vered.</P>
<P>A gale of wind coming on at midnight, we were obliged to double reef the top-&s;ails. At day-break, on the 8th, we found that the fore|ma&s;t had again given way; the fi&s;hes being &s;prung and the parts &s;o very defective, as to make it ab&s;o|lutely nece&s;&s;ary to un&s;tep the ma&s;t. Captain Cook, for &s;ome time, he&s;itated, whether he &s;hould return to Karakakooa, or take the chance of finding a harbour in the i&s;lands to leeward. The bay was not &s;o commodious, but that a bet|ter might probably be met with, either for re|pairing the ma&s;ts, or procuring refre&s;hment, the latter of which, it was imagined, the neigh|bourhood
<PB N="183" REF="030274_1012_0FE5753BA8867748">
of Karakakooa had lately been pretty well drained of. It was, on the other hand, con&s;idered as an unprudent &s;tep, to leave a to|lerable good harbour, which once lo&s;t, could not be regained, for the mere po&s;&s;ibility of meet|ing with a better, e&s;pecially as the failure of &s;uch a contingency might have deprived us of any re&s;ource.</P>
<P>We &s;tood on towards the land, to give the natives on &s;hore an opportunity of relea&s;ing their friends on board; and about noon, when we were within a mile of the &s;hore, &s;everal canoes came off to us, but &s;o loaded with people, that no room could be found for any of our gue&s;ts; the pinnace was therefore hoi&s;ted out to land them; and the ma&s;ter who commanded it, was in&s;tructed to examine the &s;outh coa&s;ts of the bay for water, but returned without &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>Variable winds, and a &s;trong current to the northward, retarded our progre&s;s in our return; and, in the evening of the 9th, about eight o'clock, it blew very hard from the &s;outh-ea&s;t, which occa&s;ioned us to clo&s;e reef the top-&s;ails. Early in the morning of the 10th, in a heavy &s;quall, we found our&s;elves clo&s;e in with the breakers, to the northward of the we&s;t point of Owhyhee. We had ju&s;t room to avoid them, and fired &s;everal guns to alarm the Di&s;covery, and apprize her of the danger.</P>
<P><PB N="184" REF="030274_1013_0FE575002480ECC8">The weather, in the forenoon, was more mo|derate, and a few canoes ventured to come off to us, when tho&s;e on board them informed us, that much mi&s;chief had been occa&s;ioned by the late &s;torms, and that a great many canoes had been lo&s;t. We kept beating to windward the remainder of the day; and, in the evening, were within a mile of the bay; but we &s;tood off and on till day-light the next morning, when we anchored in our old &s;tation.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE whole of the 11th, and part of the 12th of February, we were engaged in getting out the forema&s;t, and conveying it on &s;hore. Not only the head of the ma&s;t had &s;u&s;tain|ed damage, but the heel was become exceedingly rotten, having a very large hole in the middle of it. Several days being probably required to make
<PB N="186" REF="030274_1015_0FE575024D679078">
the nece&s;&s;ary repairs, Me&s;&s;ieurs King and Baily got the ob&s;ervatory on &s;hore, and pitched their tents on the <HI>morai,</HI> guarded by a corporal, and &s;ix marines. A friendly intercour&s;e was renewed with the prie&s;ts, who, for our greater &s;ecurity, <HI>tabooed</HI> the place with their wands as before. The &s;ail-makers al&s;o repaired to the &s;hore to re|pair the damages, in their department, &s;u&s;tained by the late heavy gales. They occupied an habi|tation, lent us by the prie&s;ts, adjoining to the <HI>morai.</HI></P>
<P>Our reception, on coming to anchor, was &s;o different from what it had been upon our fir&s;t arrival, that we were all a&s;toni&s;hed: no &s;houts, bu&s;tle, or confu&s;ion, but a &s;olitary de&s;erted bay, with hardly a canoe &s;tiring. Their curio&s;ity, indeed, might be &s;uppo&s;ed to be dimini&s;hed by this time; but the ho&s;pitable treatment we had continually been favoured with, and the friendly footing on which we parted, induced us to expect that, on our return, they would have received us with the greate&s;t demon&s;trations of joy.</P>
<P>Various were our conjectures on the cau&s;e of this extraordinary appearance, when the whole my&s;|tery was unravelled by the return of a boat, which we had &s;ent on &s;hore, bringing intelligence that Terreeoboo was ab&s;ent, and that the bay was <HI>taboo|ed.</HI> This account appeared very &s;atisfactory to ma|ny of us; but others were of opinion, that there was at this time, &s;omething very &s;u&s;picious in the
<PB N="187" REF="030274_1016_0FE5757C1228C5F0">
behaviour of the natives; and that the <HI>taboo,</HI> or interdiction, on pretence of Terreeoboo's ab|&s;ence, was artfully contrived, to give him time to con&s;ult his chiefs in what manner we &s;hould be treated. We never could a&s;certain whether the&s;e &s;u&s;picions were well founded, or whether the natives had given a true account. It is probable, indeed, that our &s;udden return, for which they could a&s;&s;ign no apparent cau&s;e, might create a|larms in them; yet the conduct of Terreeoboo, who, on his &s;uppo&s;ed arrival the next morning, immediately waited on Captain Cook; and the natives, from that moment, renewing their friendly intercour&s;e with us, &s;eem to evince that they neither meant, nor apprehended, a different kind of conduct.</P>
<P>An account of another accident, &s;imilar to this, may be mentioned in &s;upport of this opinion, which happened to us on our fir&s;t vi&s;it, the day before the king's arrival. A native having &s;old a hog on board the Re&s;olution, and received the price agreed on, Pareea, who &s;aw the tran&s;action, advi&s;ed the &s;eller not to part with his hog, without an advanced price. For his interference in this bu&s;ine&s;s, he was har&s;hly &s;poken to, and pu&s;hed away; and as the <HI>taboo</HI> was &s;oon laid on the bay, we, at fir&s;t, &s;uppo&s;ed it to be in con&s;equence of the affront offered to the chief.</P>
<P>The&s;e two circum&s;tances con&s;idered, it is ex|tremely difficult to draw any certain conclu&s;ion
<PB N="188" REF="030274_1017_0FE57504374189D0">
from the action of a people, with who&s;e language and cu&s;toms we are &s;o imperfectly acquainted. Some idea, however, may be formed of the diffi|culties tho&s;e have to encounter, who in their intercour&s;e with the&s;e &s;trangers, are obliged to &s;teer their cour&s;e in the mid&s;t of uncertainty, where the mo&s;t &s;erious con&s;equences may be oc|ca&s;ioned by only imaginary offences. Whether the&s;e conjectures are erroneous or true, it is cer|tain that things were conducted in their u&s;ual quiet cour&s;e, till the 13th of February, in the afternoon.</P>
<P>At the approach of evening on that day, the commander of the Di&s;covery's watering party, came to inform Mr. King, that &s;everal chiefs were a&s;&s;embled near the b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ach, and were driving away the natives, who a&s;&s;i&s;ted the &s;ailors in rolling the ca&s;ks to the &s;hore: at the &s;ame time declaring, that their behaviour &s;eemed exceedingly &s;u&s;pici|ous, and that he imagined they would give him &s;ome farther di&s;turbance. He &s;ent a marine with him, agreeably to his reque&s;t, but permitted him to take only his &s;ide-arms. The officer, in a &s;hort time, returned, and informed Mr. King that the inhabitants had armed them&s;elves with &s;tones, and were become tumultuous. He there|fore went him&s;elf to the &s;pot, attended by a ma|rine, with his mu&s;ket. At their approach the i&s;landers threw away their &s;tones, and, on Mr. King's application to &s;ome of the chiefs, the
<PB N="189" REF="030274_1018_0FE57594ACDD84F8">
mob was di&s;per&s;ed. Every thing being now quiet, Mr. King went to meet Captain Cook, who was then coming on &s;hore in the pinnace. He related to him what had recently happened, and received orders to fire a ball at the offenders, if they again behaved in&s;olently, and began to throw &s;tones. In con&s;equence of the&s;e directions, Mr. King gave orders to the corporal, that the &s;entinels pieces &s;hould be loaded with ball, in|&s;tead of &s;hot.</P>
<P>On our return to the tents, we heard a con|tinued fire of mu&s;quets from the Di&s;covery; which we perceived to be directed at a canoe, which was ha&s;tening towards the &s;hore, with one of our &s;mall boats in pur&s;uit of it. This firing, we concluded, was the con&s;equence of &s;ome theft, and Captain Cook ordered Mr. King to follow him with a marine armed, and to endea|vour to &s;eize the people as they landed. They accordingly ran to the place, where the canoe was expected to come a&s;hore, but did not arrive in time; the people having quitted it, and fled into the country before their arrival.</P>
<P>At this time they did not know that the goods had been already re&s;tored; and thinking it pro|bable, from what they had ob&s;erved, that they might be of importance, they did not choo&s;e to relinqui&s;h their endeavours to recover them; and having inquired of the natives what cour&s;e the people had taken, they pur&s;ued them till it was
<PB N="190" REF="030274_1019_0FE57505C0E79528">
almo&s;t dark, when they &s;uppo&s;ed them&s;elves to be about three miles from the tents; and, think|ing the i&s;landers amu&s;ed them with fal&s;e informa|tion in their pur&s;uit, they gave up the &s;earch and returned.</P>
<P>A difference of a more &s;erious nature had hap|pened during their ab&s;ence. The officer, who had been di&s;patched in the &s;mall boat after the thieves, and who was returning on board, with the booty that had been re&s;tored, &s;eeing Captain Cook and Mr. King engaged in the pur&s;uit of the offenders, &s;eized a canoe, which was drawn upon the &s;hore. This canoe unfortunately be|longed to Pareea, who, at that in&s;tant arriving from on board of the Di&s;covery, claimed his pro|perty and prote&s;ted his innocence. The officer per&s;i&s;ted in detaining it, in which he was en|couraged by the crew of the pinnace, then wait|ing for Captain Cook; in con&s;equence of which a &s;cuffle en&s;ued, and Pareea was knocked down by a violent blow on the head, with an oar. Several of the natives, who had hitherto been peaceable &s;pectators, began now to attack our people with &s;uch a &s;hower of &s;tones, that they were forced to a precipitate retreat, and &s;wam off to a rock, at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance from the &s;hore. The pinnace was plundered immediately by the natives, and would have been entirely demoli&s;hed, if Pareea had not interpo&s;ed; who had not only recovered from his blow, but had
<PB N="191" REF="030274_1020_0FE575930536C338">
al&s;o forgot it at the &s;ame in&s;tant. He ordered the crowd to di&s;per&s;e, and beckoned to our peo|ple to come and take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the pinnace; and afterwards a&s;&s;ured them that he would u&s;e his influence to get the things re&s;tored <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ch had been taken out of it. After their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">parture, he followed them in his canoe, carrying them a mid|&s;hipman's cap, and &s;ome other articles of the plunder; and, expre&s;&s;ing much conce<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> at what had happened, begged to know if the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> would kill him, and whether he might be permitted to come on board the next day? He was a&s;&s;ured that he would be well received, and therefore joined no&s;es with the officers (their u&s;ual token of friend&s;hip) and paddled over to Kowrowa.</P>
<P>Captain Cook, when the&s;e particulars were re|pre&s;ented to him, was exceedingly concerned; and, when he and Mr. King were returning on board, he expre&s;&s;ed his fears that the&s;e i&s;landers would oblige him to pur&s;ue violent mea&s;ures; adding they mu&s;t not be permitted to &s;uppo&s;e, that they have gained any advantage over us. It was then, however, too late to take any &s;teps that evening; he therefore only gave orders that every i&s;lander &s;hould be immediately turned out of the &s;hip. This order being executed, Mr. King returned on &s;hore; and the events of the day having much abated our former confidence in the natives, a double guard was po&s;ted on the <HI>morai,</HI> with orders to let Mr. King know, if any
<PB N="192" REF="030274_1021_0FE5750AA1140098">
men were &s;een lurking about the beach. At eleven o'clock, five of the natives were &s;een creep|ing round the bottom of the <HI>morai</HI>; they ap|proached with great caution, and, at la&s;t, per|ceiving they were di&s;covered, immediately re|tired out of &s;ight. About midnight one of them ventured him&s;elf near the ob&s;ervatory, when a &s;entinel fired over him; on which they all fled, and we had no farther di&s;turbance during the re|mainder of the night.</P>
<P>At day-light the next morning Mr. King went on board the Re&s;olution, in order to get the time|keeper; and in his way thither was hailed by the Di&s;covery, and received information that their cutter, had &s;ome time in the night been &s;tolen, from the buoy, where it had been moored.</P>
<P>On Mr. King's arrival on board, he found the marines were arming them&s;elves, and Captain Cook bu&s;ied in loading his double-barrelled gun. Whil&s;t he was acquaintng him with what had happened in the night at the <HI>morai,</HI> he eagerly interrupted him, and informed him of the lo&s;s of the Di&s;covery's cutter, and the preparations he was making to recover it. It was his u&s;ual prac|tice in all the i&s;lands of this ocean, when any thing of con&s;equence had been &s;tolen from him, by &s;ome &s;tratagem, to get the king, or &s;ome of the prin|cipal <HI>Erees,</HI> on board; where he detained them as ho&s;tages, till the property was re&s;tored. This method having hitherto proved &s;ucce&s;sful, he
<PB N="193" REF="030274_1022_0FE5757D9A0164F8">
meant to adopt on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion; and gave orders to &s;top every canoe that &s;hould attempt to leave the bay; re&s;olving to &s;eize and de&s;troy them if the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">utter could not be recovered by peaceable means. In pur&s;uance of which, the boats of both &s;hips, properly manned and armed, were &s;tation|ed acro&s;s the bay; and before Mr. King quitted the &s;hip, &s;ome great guns were fired at two canoes, that were attempting to e&s;cape.</P>
<P>Between &s;even and eight o'clock Captain Cook and Mr. King quitted the &s;hip together; the former in the pinnace, with Mr. Phillips, and nine marines; and the latter in the &s;mall boat. The la&s;t orders Mr. King received from Captain Cook were to quiet the minds of the people, on our &s;ide of the bay, by the &s;tronge&s;t a&s;&s;urances that they &s;hould not be injured; to keep his people together, and to be continually on his guard. Captain Cook and Mr. King then &s;epa|rated; the Captain going towards Kowrowa, where Terreeoboo re&s;ided, and Mr. King proceed|ed to the beach: his fir&s;t bu&s;ine&s;s, when he arrived on &s;hore, was to i&s;&s;ue &s;trict orders to the marines to continue within the tent, to charge their mu&s;|quets with ball, and not on any con&s;ideration, to quit their arms. He then attended old Kaoo and the prie&s;ts at their re&s;pective huts, and explained to them, as well as he was able, the rea&s;on of the ho&s;tile preparations, which had &s;o exceedingly alarmed them. He found they were no &s;trangers

to the circum&s;tance of the cutter's being &s;tolen, and a&s;&s;ured them, that though the Commodore was not only re&s;olved to recover it, but al&s;o to puni&s;h, in the mo&s;t exemplary manner, the au|thors of the theft; yet that they, and all the in|habitants of the village, on our &s;ide, had not the lea&s;t occa&s;ion to be alarmed, or to apprehend the lea&s;t danger from us. He importuned the prie&s;ts to communicate this to the people, and intreat them not to entertain an idea of fear, but to con|tinue peaceable and quiet. Kaoo interrogated Mr. King, with great emotion, if any harm was to happen to Terreeoboo? He a&s;&s;ured him there was not; and both he and his brethren appeared much &s;atisfied with this a&s;&s;urance.</P>
<P>Captain Cook having, in the mean time, called off the launch, from the north point of the bay, and taken it with him, landed at Kowrowa, with tile lieutenant and nine marines. He proceeded immediately into the village, where he was re|&s;pectfully received; the people, as u&s;ual, pro|&s;trating them&s;elves before him, and making their accu&s;tomed offerings of &s;mall hogs. Perceiving that his de&s;ign was not &s;u&s;pected, his next &s;tep was, to inquire for the king, and the two boys, his &s;ons, who had been almo&s;t continually his gue&s;ts on board the Re&s;olution. The boys pre|&s;ently returned with the natives, who had been &s;earching for them, and immediately conducted Captain Cook to the habitation where Terreeoboo
<PB N="195" REF="030274_1024_0FE57551494C8228">
had &s;lept. The old man had ju&s;t awoke; and after &s;ome conver&s;ation re&s;pecting the lo&s;s of the cutter, from which the Commodore was con|vinced that he was not in any wi&s;e privy to it, he invited him to accompany him, and &s;pend the day on board the Re&s;olution. The king accept|ed the invitation, and ro&s;e immediately to ac|company him.</P>
<P>Every thing had now a pro&s;perous appearance; the two boys were already in the pinnace, and the re&s;t of the party approaching the water &s;ide, when a woman, named Kanee-kabareea the mother of the boys, and one of Terreeoboo's favourite wives, followed him, be&s;eeching him, with tears and entreaties, not to venture to go on board. Two chiefs, who came with her, took hold of him, and in&s;i&s;ted he &s;hould proceed no farther, obliged him to &s;it down. The i&s;landers, now collecting in va&s;t numbers along the &s;hore, who had probably been alarmed by the di&s;charging of the great guns, and the ho&s;tile appearances in the bay, gathered together round Captain Cook and Ter|reeoboo. Thus &s;ituated, the lieutenant of ma|rine, perceiving that his men were huddled to|gether in the croud, and con&s;equently unable to u&s;e their arms, if there &s;hould appear to be a nece&s;&s;ity for it&punc; propo&s;ed to Captain Cook, to draw them up along the rocks, clo&s;e to the edge of the water. The populace making way for them to pa&s;s, the lieutenant drew them up in a
<PB N="196" REF="030274_1025_0FE5750E11400BD0">
line; within about thirty yards of the place where Terreeoboo was &s;itting,</P>
<P>The old king continued, all this time, on the ground, bearing the mo&s;t vi&s;ible marks of terror and dejection in his countenance. Captain Cook, unwilling to abandon the object which occa&s;ioned him to come on &s;hore, urged him mo&s;t earne&s;tly to proceed: whil&s;t, on the other hand, if the king expre&s;&s;ed any inclination to follow him, the chiefs who &s;urrounded him, interpo&s;ed; at fir&s;t they had recour&s;e to prayers and entreaties, but after|wards to force and violence, and even in&s;i&s;ted on his remaining on &s;hore. Captain Cook, at length, perceiving that the alarm had &s;pread too gene|rally, and that there was not a probability of getting him off without much blood&s;hed, gave up the point; at the &s;ame time ob&s;erving, to Mr. Phillips, that to compel him to go on board, would probably occa&s;ion the lo&s;s of many of the lives of the inhabitants.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding this enterprize had now fail|ed, and was abandoned by Captain Cook, yet it did not appear that his per&s;on was in the lea&s;t degree of danger, till an accident happened, which occa&s;ioned a fatal turn to the affair. The boats, &s;tationed acro&s;s the bay, having fired at &s;ome canoes, for attempting to get out, unfor|tunately had killed one of their principal chiefs. Intelligence of his death arrived at the village where Captain Cook then was, ju&s;t as he had
<PB N="197" REF="030274_1026_0FE5754A00D58FE0">
parted from the king, and was proceeding with great deliberation towards the &s;hore. The fer|ment it immediately occa&s;ioned, was but too con|&s;picuous; the women and children were in&s;tantly &s;ent away, and the men were &s;oon clad in their war-mats, and armed with &s;pears and &s;tones. One of the natives having provided him&s;elf with a &s;tone, and a long iron &s;pike (called by the na|tives a <HI>pahooa</HI>) advanced towards the Captain, flouri&s;hing his weapon in defiance, and threaten|ing to throw the &s;tone. The Captain reque&s;ted him to de&s;i&s;t; the i&s;lander repeated his me|nace, he was highly provoked, and fired a load of &s;mall &s;hot at him. The man was &s;hielded in his war-mat, which the &s;hot could not penetrate; his firing therefore, &s;erved only to irritate and encourage them. Vollies of &s;tones were thrown at the marines; and one of the <HI>erees</HI> attempted the life of Mr. Phillips with his <HI>pahooa;</HI> but, not &s;ucceeding in the attempt, he received from him a blow with the butt end of his piece. Cap|tain Cook immediately di&s;charged his &s;econd bar|rel, loaded with ball, and killed one of the mo&s;t violent of the a&s;&s;ailants. A general attack with &s;tones &s;ucceeded, which was followed on our part, by a di&s;charge of mu&s;quetry, not only from the marines, but al&s;o from the people in the boats. The natives, to our great a&s;toni&s;hment, received our fire with great firmne&s;s; and with|out giving time for the marines to charge again,
<PB N="198" REF="030274_1027_0FE5751017374C60">
they ru&s;hed in upon them with dreadful &s;houts and yells. What followed was a &s;cene of horror and confu&s;ion, which can more ea&s;ily be conceived than properly related.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Though a view of Karakakoo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ay, by Mr. Webber, has appeared in Captain Cook's Voyage in Quarto, no engraving has there been given of the death of the much-lamented Commander.

<P>Four of the marines retreated among the rocks, and fell a &s;acrifice to the fury of the ene|my; three others were dangerou&s;ly wounded; and the lieutenant &s;tabbed between the &s;houlders with a <HI>pahooa;</HI> but having fortunately re&s;erved his fire, &s;hot the man from whom he had received the wound, at the in&s;tant he was preparing to repeat his blow.

<P>It was imagined by &s;ome of tho&s;e who were pre&s;ent, that the marines, and tho&s;e who were in the boats, fired without Captain Cook's orders, and that he was anxious to prevent the farther effu&s;ion of blood; it is therefore probable, that, on this occa&s;ion, his humanity proved fatal to him: for it was ob&s;erved, that while he faced the natives, no violence had been offered him, but, when he turned about, to give directions to

the boats, he was &s;tabbed in the back, and fell with his face into the water.

<P>Such was the fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e of our mo&s;t excellent Com|mander! After a life, di&s;tingui&s;hed by &s;uch &s;uc|ce&s;sful enterprize, his death can hardly be reck|oned premature; &s;ince he lived to accompli&s;h the great work for which he &s;eemed particularly de&s;igned; being rather removed from the enjoy|ment, than the acqui&s;ition of glory. How &s;in|cerely his lo&s;s was lamented, by tho&s;e who owed their &s;ecurity to his &s;kill and conduct, and every con&s;olation, to his tenderne&s;s and humanity, it is impo&s;&s;ible to de&s;cribe; and the ta&s;k would be equally difficult to repre&s;ent the horror, dejection, and di&s;may, which followed &s;o dreadful and un|expected a cata&s;trophe. Let us, therefore, turn from &s;o calamitous a &s;cene, to the plea&s;ing con|templation of his character and virtues, and pay our la&s;t ju&s;t tribute to the memory of this wor|thy man, in a &s;hort hi&s;tory of his life, and public &s;ervices.</P>
<P>Captain James Cook was born in the year 1727, near Whitby, in York&s;hire; and at an early age, commenced an apprentice&s;hip to a &s;hop|keeper in a neighbouring village. This not be|ing
<PB N="200" REF="030274_1030_0FE57517AF10FEF8">
&s;uitable to his natural propen&s;ity, he &s;oon quitted the counter, and contracted for nine years, with the ma&s;ter of a ve&s;&s;el in the coal trade. In 1755, at the commencement of the war, he entered into the king's &s;ervice on board the Eagle, then Commanded by Captain Hamer, and afterwards by Sir Hugh Palli&s;er, who per|ceiving his merit, advanced him to the quarter deck.</P>
<P>In 1758, we find him ma&s;ter of the Northum|berland, Lord Colville's flag &s;hip, who then commanded the &s;quadron, &s;tationed on the coa&s;t of America. Here, as he has frequently declar|ed, he fir&s;t read Euclid, and clo&s;ely applied him|&s;elf to the &s;tudy of the mathematics, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of only a few books, and his own indu&s;|try. While he thus found means to cultivate his under&s;tanding, and &s;upply, in &s;ome degree, the deficiencies of an early education, he was engaged in mo&s;t of the active &s;cenes of war in America. At the &s;iege of Quebec, he was intru&s;ted by Sir Charles Saunders with the execution of important &s;ervices, in the naval department. He was the pilot who conducted the boats to the attack of Montmorency; managed the embarkation to the heights of Abraham; and pointed out, by buoys, how the large &s;hips might proceed with &s;ecurity up the river. The manner in which he acquitted him&s;elf in the&s;e important &s;ervices, procured him the e&s;teem and friend&s;hip of Sir Charles Saunders
<PB N="201" REF="030274_1031_0FE57566EB3B2380">
and Lord Colville, who continued his zealous patrons during the remainder of their lives. At the conclu&s;ion of the war, he was appointed, through the intere&s;t of Lord Colville and Sir Hugh Palli&s;er, to make a &s;urvey of the Gulf of St. Lawrence, and the coa&s;ts of Newfoundland. He was thus employed till the year 1767, when Sir Edward Hawke appointed him to the com|mand of an expedition to the South Seas; in or|der to make an ob&s;ervation of the tran&s;it of <HI>Venus,</HI> and to pro&s;ecute di&s;coveries in that part of the globe.</P>
<P>His &s;ervices, &s;ince this period, are too gene|rally known to require enumeration. His repu|tation has proportionably advanced beyond the effect of panegyric. He &s;eems, indeed, to have been peculiarly qualified for this &s;pecies of enter|prize. His natural inclination, the nature of his &s;ervices, and indefatigable application, all con|&s;pired to compleat him for it: &s;o that he acquir|ed &s;uch a degree of profe&s;&s;ional knowledge, as can fall to the lot of very few.</P>
<P>His frame and con&s;titution were robu&s;t, and &s;uch as enabled him to undergo the &s;evere&s;t hard&s;hips. When nece&s;&s;ity required it, he could feed, with &s;atisfaction, upon the coar&s;e&s;t and mo&s;t ungrate|ful food; and he &s;ubmitted to every kind of &s;elf-denial with the greate&s;t compo&s;ure and indiffe|rence. Nor were the qualities of his mind le&s;s vi|gorous than tho&s;e of his body. His under&s;tand|ing
<PB N="202" REF="030274_1032_0FE57519872E93C8">
was &s;trong and per&s;picuous: his judgment, e&s;pecially in tho&s;e matters in which he was more particularly engaged, quick and &s;ure. His de|&s;igns and operations, were the natural re&s;ult of a great original genius. His valour was cool, deliberate, and determined; accompanied with a mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hing pre&s;ence of mind on the ap|proach of danger. His manners were plain, ea&s;y, and unaffected. His temper, it mu&s;t be admitted, was too much &s;ubject to ha&s;tine&s;s and pa&s;&s;ion; but this &s;hould be forgotten, when it is con&s;ider|ed, that this di&s;po&s;ition was the mo&s;t benevolent and humane.</P>
<P>The&s;e are a few traits or outlines of the charac|ter of Captain Cook; but its di&s;tingui&s;hing fea|ture was, the mo&s;t unremitting per&s;everance to accompli&s;h his de&s;ign, in oppo&s;ition to dangers, difficulties and hard&s;hips. During all his long and tedious voyages, his eagerne&s;s and activity were never in the lea&s;t abated. No alluring in|citement could detain him for a moment; even tho&s;e intervals of recreation, which unavoidably occured in the cour&s;e of our &s;ervices, and were joyfully embraced by many of his officers, were &s;ubmitted to, by him with impatience, if they could not be made &s;ub&s;ervient to the more effec|tual pro&s;ecution of his de&s;igns.</P>
<P>It would be unnece&s;&s;ary to recapitulate the in|&s;tances in which the&s;e qualities were di&s;played. The re&s;ult of his &s;ervices, however, we &s;hall ju&s;t
<PB N="203" REF="030274_1033_0FE5759FDD85E838">
touch upon, under two principal heads, viz. geo|graphy and navigation, placing each in a &s;eparate and di&s;tinct point of view.</P>
<P>No &s;cience, it is pre&s;umed, has ever received greater additions from the labours of one man, than geography has done from tho&s;e of Captain Cook. In his fir&s;t voyage, he di&s;covered the Society I&s;lands; a&s;certained the in&s;ularity of New Zealand; and di&s;covered the &s;traits which &s;eparate the two i&s;lands, and are called after his name. He explored the ea&s;tern coa&s;t of New Holland, till then unknown; an extent of twenty-&s;even degrees of latitude, and upwards of two thou&s;and miles.</P>
<P>He gave, in his &s;econd expedition, a re&s;olu|tion to the great problem of a &s;outhern conti|nent; having &s;o completely traver&s;ed that hemi|&s;phere, as not to leave a po&s;&s;ibility of its exi&s;t|ence, unle&s;s it is &s;o near the pole, as to be be|yond the reach of navigation. New Caledonia, the large&s;t i&s;land in the Southern Pacific, except New Zealand, was di&s;covered in this voyage. Al&s;o the i&s;land of Georgia; and an unknown coa&s;t, which the Captain named Sandwich land; and having twice vi&s;ited the tropical &s;eas, he &s;et|tled the &s;ituations of the old, and made &s;everal new di&s;coveries.</P>
<P>His third and la&s;t voyage, however, is di&s;tin|gui&s;hed above the re&s;t, by the extent and im|portance of its di&s;coveries. Not to mention the
<PB N="204" REF="030274_1034_0FE5751B0E04D248">
&s;everal &s;maller i&s;lands in the Southern Pacific, he di&s;covered the group, called the Sandwich i&s;lands; which, on account of their &s;ituation and produc|tions, may perhaps become an object of more co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">equence than any other di&s;covery in the South Sea. He explored what had before re|mained unknown of the we&s;tern coa&s;t of Ame|rica, an extent of three thou&s;and &s;even, hundred miles; a&s;certained the proximity of the two con|tinents of A&s;ia and America; &s;ailed through the &s;traits between them, and &s;urveyed the coa&s;ts on each &s;ide, &s;o far as to be &s;atisfied of the imprac|ticability of a pa&s;&s;age in that hemi&s;phere, from the Atlantic into the Pacific Ocean, by an ea&s;t|ern or we&s;tern cour&s;e. He has, in &s;hort, com|pleated the hydrography of the habitable globe, if we except the Japane&s;e Archipelago, and the &s;ea of Amur, which are &s;till imperfectly known by Europeans.</P>
<P>His &s;ervices, as a navigator, are not le&s;s im|portant and meritorious. The method which he invented, and &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully put in practice, of pre&s;erving the health (and con&s;equently the lives) of &s;eamen, will tran&s;mit his name to future ages, as a friend and benefactor to mankind.</P>
<P>It is well known among tho&s;e who are con|ver&s;ant in naval hi&s;tory, that the advantages which have been &s;ought, through the medium of long &s;ea-voyages, have always been purcha&s;ed at a dear rate. That dreadful di&s;order which is
<PB N="205" REF="030274_1035_0FE575F7426F2F28">
pecullar to this &s;ervire, mu&s;t, without exerci&s;ing an unwarrantable degree of tyranny over our &s;eamen, have been an in&s;uperable ob&s;tacle to our enterprizes. It was re&s;erved for Captain Cook to convince the world, that voyages might be pro|tracted to three or even four years, in unknown regions, and under every change of climate, without affecting the health in the &s;malle&s;t de|gree, and even without dimini&s;hing the probabi|lity of life. His method has been fully explain|ed, in a paper which was read before the Royal Society, in 1776 <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r God&s;r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> Copl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y's gold medal was awarded him, on that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"></NOTE>.</P>
<P>Re&s;pecting his profe&s;&s;ional abilities, they mu&s;t be &s;ubmitted to the judgment of tho&s;e who are acquainted with the &s;ervices in which he was en|gaged. They cannot but acknowledge, that to have conducted three &s;uch dangerous and diffi|cult expeditions, of &s;o unu&s;ual a length, with invariable &s;ucce&s;s, mu&s;t not only have required an accurate knowledge of his bu&s;ine&s;s, but al&s;o a mo&s;t powerful and comprehen&s;ive genius.</P>
<P>Having thus given a faithful, though a con|ci&s;e account of the death of our much lamented Commander, and al&s;o of his character and &s;er|vices, his memory mu&s;t now be le&s;t to the gra|titude and the admiration of po&s;terity.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>WE have before ob&s;erved that four of the marines, who accompanied Captain Cook, were killed by the natives on the &s;pot. The others, with their lieutenant, Mr. Phillips, threw them&s;elves into the &s;ea, and made their e&s;cape, being protected by a &s;mart fire from the boats.
<PB N="207" REF="030274_1037_0FE5754458BCA440">
On this occa&s;ion, a &s;triking in&s;tance of gallant behaviour, and of affection for his men, was di&s;|played by Mr. Phillips; for he had &s;carcely got into the boat, when &s;eeing one of the marines, who was not a very expert &s;wimmer, &s;truggling in the water, and in danger of being taken by the i&s;landers, he in&s;tantly leaped into the &s;ea to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, though con&s;iderably wounded him&s;elf; and after receiving a blow on his head from a &s;tone, which had almo&s;t &s;ent him to the bottom, he caught the marine by the hair, and brought him off in &s;afety. Our people for &s;ome time kept up a con&s;tant fire from the boats (which during the whole tran&s;action, were at no greater di&s;tance from the land than twenty yards), in order to af|ford their unfortunate companions, if any of them &s;hould &s;till remain alive, an opportunity of ef|fecting their e&s;cape. The&s;e continued efforts, &s;econded by a few guns, that were at the &s;ame time fired from the Re&s;olution, having at length compelled the enemy to retire, a &s;mall boat, manned by five mid&s;hipmen, pulled towards the &s;hore where they perceived the bodies lying on the ground, without any &s;igns of life. However, they judged it dangerous to attempt to bring them off with &s;o incon&s;iderable a force; and their ammunition being nearly con&s;umed, they re|turned to the &s;hips, leaving the bodies in po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of the natives, together with ten &s;tand of arms.</P>
<P><PB N="208" REF="030274_1038_0FE57523D0089D40">When the general con&s;ternation, which the news of this misfortune had diffu&s;ed throughout the whole company of both &s;hips, had in &s;ome degree &s;ub&s;ided, their attention was called to the party of the <HI>morai,</HI> where the ma&s;t and &s;ails were on &s;hore, guarded by only &s;ix marines. It is dif|ficult to de&s;cribe the emotions that agitated the minds of Mr. King and his attendants, at this &s;tation, during the time in which the&s;e occur|rences had happened, at the other &s;ide of the bay. Being at the di&s;tance only of a mile from the vil|lage of Kowrowa, they could di&s;tinctly perceive a va&s;t multitude of people collected on the &s;pot where Captain Cook had ju&s;t before landed. They heard the firing of the mu&s;quets, and ob&s;erved an uncommon bu&s;tle and agitation among the crowd. They afterwards &s;aw the i&s;landers re|treating, the boats retiring from the &s;hore, and pa&s;&s;ing and repa&s;&s;ing, with great &s;tillne&s;s be|tween the &s;hips. Mr. King's heart &s;oon mi&s;gave him on this occa&s;ion. Where &s;o valuable a life was concerned, he could not avoid being alarm|ed by &s;uch new and threatening appearances. Be&s;ides this, he knew that Captain Cook, from a long &s;eries of &s;ucce&s;s, in his tran&s;actions with the natives of this ocean, had acquired a degree of confidence, which might, in &s;ome ill-fated mo|ment, put him too much off his guard; and Mr. King now &s;aw all the dangers to which that confi|dence might lead, without deriving much con|&s;olation
<PB N="209" REF="030274_1039_0FE57552D1B29038">
from the con&s;ideration of the experience which had given ri&s;e to it. His fir&s;t care, on hearing the report of the mu&s;quets, was to a&s;&s;ure the i&s;landers, con&s;iderable numbers of whom were a&s;&s;embled round the wall of our con&s;ecrated field, and &s;eemed at a lo&s;s how to account for what they had heard and &s;een, that they &s;hould meet with no mole&s;tation; and that, at all events, he was in|clined to continue on peaceable terms with them.</P>
<P>Mr. King and his attendants remained in this &s;ituation, till the boats had returned on board, when Captain Clerke perceiving, by means of his tele&s;cope, that our party was &s;urrounded by the natives, who, he thought, de&s;igned to attack them, ordered two four-pounders to be fired at the i&s;landers. The&s;e guns, though well aimed, did no mi&s;chief; but they gave the natives a con|vincing proof of their powerful effects. A cocoa-nut-tree, under which &s;ome of them were &s;itting, was broken in the middle by one of the balls; and the other &s;hivered a rock, which &s;tood in an exact line with them. As Mr. King had, ju&s;t before, given them the &s;tronge&s;t a&s;&s;urances of their &s;afety, he was extremely mortified at this act of ho&s;tility, and, to prevent its being repeat|ed, in&s;tantly di&s;patched a boat to inform Captain Clerke, that he was, at pre&s;ent, on the mo&s;t amicable terms with the i&s;landers, and that, if any future occa&s;ion &s;hould ari&s;e for changing his conduct towards them, he would hoi&s;t a jack, as
<PB N="210" REF="030274_1040_0FE5752594BF0518">
a &s;ignal for Captain Clerke to afford him his a&s;|&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>Mr King waited the return of the boat with the greate&s;t impatience; and after remaining for the &s;pace of a quarter of an hour, under the ut|mo&s;t anxiety and &s;u&s;pence, his fears were at length confirmed, by the arrivel of Mr. Bligh, with or|ders to &s;trike the tents immediately, and to &s;end on board the &s;ails, that were repairing. At the &s;ame in&s;tant, Kaireekeea having al&s;o received in|formation of the death of Captain Cook, from a native who had arrived from the other &s;ide of the bay, approached Mr. King, with great dejection and &s;orrow in his countenance, inquiring whether it was true.</P>
<P>The &s;ituation of the party, at this time, was highly critical and important. Not only their own lives, but the i&s;&s;ue of the expedition, and the return of at lea&s;t one of the &s;hips, were in|volved in the &s;ame common danger. They had the ma&s;t of the Re&s;olution, and the greater part of the &s;ails, on &s;hore, protected by only half a dozen marines. The lo&s;s of the&s;e would have been irreparable; and though the i&s;landers had not as yet te&s;tified the &s;malle&s;t di&s;po&s;ition to mole&s;t the party, it was difficult to an&s;wer for the alteration, which the intelligence of the tran&s;|action at Kowrowa might produce. Mr. King therefore thought proper to di&s;&s;emble his belief of the death of Captain Cook, and to de&s;ire
<PB N="211" REF="030274_1041_0FE575AA26520F00">
Kaireekeea to di&s;courage the report; apprehend|ing that either the fear of our re&s;entment, or the &s;ucce&s;sful example of their countrymen, might perhaps lead them to &s;eize the favourable oppor|tunity, which at this time pre&s;ented it&s;elf, of giv|ing us a &s;econd blow. He, at the &s;ame time, ad|vi&s;ed him to bring old Kaoo, and the other prie&s;ts, into a large hou&s;e adjoining to the <HI>morai,</HI> partly from a regard to their &s;afety, in ca&s;e it &s;hould have been found nece&s;&s;ary to have recour&s;e to violent mea&s;ures; and partly from a de&s;ire of having him near our people, in order to make u&s;e of his authority with the natives, if it could be in&s;trumental in maintaining peace.</P>
<P>Mr. King having &s;tationed the marines on the top of the <HI>morai,</HI> which formed a &s;trong and advantageous po&s;t, intru&s;ted the command to Mr. Bligh, who received the mo&s;t po&s;itive directions to act &s;olely on the defen&s;ive, went on board the Di&s;covery, in order to confer with Captain Clerke on the dangerous &s;ituation of our affairs. He had no &s;ooner left the &s;pot, than the i&s;landers began to annoy our people with &s;tones; and ju&s;t after he had reached the &s;hip, he heard the firing of the marines. He therefore ha&s;tily returned on &s;hore, where he found affairs growing every mo|ment more alarming. The natives were provid|ing arms, and putting on their mats; and their numbers augmented very fa&s;t. He al&s;o ob&s;erved &s;everal large bodies advancing towards our party
<PB N="212" REF="030274_1042_0FE575271A679138">
along the cliff, by which the village of Kakooa is &s;eparated from the north &s;ide of the bay, where Kowrowa is &s;ituate.</P>
<P>They at fir&s;t attacked our people with &s;tones from behind the walls of their inclo&s;ures, and meeting with no re&s;i&s;tance, they &s;oon became more daring. A few courageous fellows, having crept along the beach, under cover of the rocks, &s;uddenly pre&s;ented them&s;elves at the foot of the <HI>morai,</HI> with an intention of &s;torming it on the &s;ide next the &s;ea, which was its only acce&s;&s;ible part; and they were not di&s;lodged before they had &s;tood a con&s;iderable quantity of &s;hot, and had &s;een one of their number fall.</P>
<P>The courage of one of the&s;e a&s;&s;ailants de&s;erves to be recorded. Having returned with a view of carrying off his companion, amid&s;t the fire of our whole party, he received a wound, which obliged him to quit the body, and retire; but, a few minutes afterwards, he again made his ap|pearance, and receiving another wound, was un|der the nece&s;&s;ity of retreating a &s;econd time. At that moment Mr. King arrived at the <HI>morai,</HI> and &s;aw this man return a third time, faint from the lo&s;s of blood and fatigue. Being informed of what had happened, he forbad the &s;oldiers to fire; and the i&s;lander was &s;uffered to carry off his friend, which he was ju&s;t able to accompli&s;h; and then fell down him&s;elf, and breathed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">.</P>
<P><PB N="213" REF="030274_1043_0FE575EEF74AA5D8">A &s;trong reinforcement from both &s;hips having landed about this time, the natives retreated be|hind their walls; which affording Mr. King ac|ce&s;s to the prie&s;ts, he &s;ent one of them to exert his endeavours to bring his countrymen to &s;ome terms, and to propo&s;e to them, that if they would de&s;i&s;t from throwing &s;tones, he would not allow our men to fire. This truce was agreed to, and our people were &s;uffered to launch the ma&s;t, and carry off the &s;ails, a&s;tronomical in&s;truments, &amp;c. without mole&s;tation. As &s;oon as our party had quitted the <HI>morai,</HI> the i&s;landers took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, and &s;ome of them threw a few &s;tones, which, however did no mi&s;chief.</P>
<P>Between eleven and twelve o'clock, Mr. King arrived on board the Di&s;covery, where he found that no deci&s;ive plan had been adopted for the regulation of our future proceedings. The re|covery of Captain Cook's body, and the re&s;titu|tion of the boat, were the objects, which, on all hands, we agreed to in&s;i&s;t on; and Mr. King de|clared it as his opinion, that &s;ome vigorous me|thods &s;hould be put in execution, if the demand of them &s;hould not be in&s;tantly complied with.</P>
<P>Though it may ju&s;tly be &s;uppo&s;ed that Mr. King's feelings, on the death of a beloved and re&s;pected friend, had &s;ome &s;hare in this opinion, yet there were doubtle&s;s other rea&s;ons, and tho&s;e, of the mo&s;t &s;erious nature that had &s;ome weight with him. The confidence which the &s;ucce&s;s or
<PB N="214" REF="030274_1044_0FE5752D436C7ED0">
the natives in killing our Commander, and oblig|ing us to leave the &s;hore, mu&s;t naturally have in|&s;pired; and the advantage, however incon&s;ider|able, which they had gained over us the preced|ing day, would, he had on doubt, excite them to make farther dangerous attempts; and the more particularly, as they had no great rea&s;on, from what they had hitherto ob&s;erved, to dread the effects of our fire-arms. This kind of weapon, indeed, contrary to the expectation of us all, had produced in them no &s;igns of terror. On our &s;ide, &s;uch was the condition of our ve&s;&s;els, and the &s;tate of di&s;cipline among us, that, had a vigorous attack been made on us, during the night, the con&s;equences might perhaps have been highly di&s;agreeable. Mr. King was &s;upported, in the&s;e apprehen&s;ions, by the opinon of the greater part of the officers on board; and no|thing &s;eemed to him more likely to encourage the i&s;landers to make the attempt, than the ap|pearance of our being inclined to an accommoda|tion, which they could only impute to weakne&s;s, or fear.</P>
<P>On the other hand it was urged, in favour of more conciliatory mea&s;ures, that the mi&s;chief was already done, and was irreparable! that the na|tives, by rea&s;on of their former friend&s;hip and kindne&s;s, had a &s;trong claim to our regard; and the more particularly, as the late calamitous ac|cident did not appear to have taken its ri&s;e from
<PB N="215" REF="030274_1045_0FE575E2F93A7788">
any premeditated de&s;ign; that, on the part of Terreeoboo, his ignorance of the theft, his wil|lingne&s;s to accompany Captain Cook on board the Re&s;olution, and his having actually &s;ent his two &s;ons into the pinnace, mu&s;t re&s;cue his character, in this re&s;pect, from the &s;malle&s;t degree of &s;u&s;|picion; that the behaviour of his woman, and the chiefs, might ea&s;ily be accounted for, from the apprehen&s;ions occa&s;ioned in their minds by the armed force, with which Captain Cook landed, and the ho&s;tile preparations in the bay; appear|ances &s;o un&s;uitable to the confidence and friend|&s;hip, in which both parties had hitherto lived, that the arming of the i&s;landers was manife&s;tly with a de&s;ign to re&s;i&s;t the attempt, which they had &s;ome rea&s;on to expect would be made, to carry off their &s;overeign by force, and was natural|ly to be expected from a people who had a re|markable affection for their chiefs.</P>
<P>To the&s;e dictates of humanity, other motives of a prudential kind were added; that we were in want of a &s;upply of water, and other refre&s;h|ments; that the Re&s;olution's forema&s;t would re|quire &s;even or eight days work, before it could be &s;tepped; that the &s;pring was advancing very fa&s;t; and that the &s;peedy pro&s;ecution of our next ex|pedition to the northward, ought now to be our &s;ole object; and that, therefore, to engage in a vindictive conte&s;t with the natives, might not only &s;ubject us to the imputation of needle&s;s
<PB N="216" REF="030274_1046_0FE575F1190A85C0">
cruelty, but would require great delay in the equipment of our &s;hips.</P>
<P>Captain Clerke concurred in this latter opinion; and though Mr. King was convinced, that an early and vigorous di&s;play of our re&s;entment would have more effectually an&s;wered every object both of prudence and humanity, he was, upon the whole, not &s;orry, that the mea&s;ures he had re|commended were rejected. For though the con|temptuous behaviour of the i&s;landers, and their &s;ub&s;equent oppo&s;ition to our nece&s;&s;ary occupations on &s;hore, ari&s;ing, mo&s;t probably, from a mi&s;|con&s;truction of our lenity, obliged us at la&s;t to have recour&s;e to violence in our own defence; yet he was not certain, that the circum&s;tances of the ca&s;e would, in the opinion of the generality of people, have ju&s;tified the u&s;e of force, on our part, in the fir&s;t in&s;tance. Cautionary &s;everity is ever invidious, and the rigour of a preventive mea&s;ure, when it is the mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful, leaves its expediency the lea&s;t apparent.</P>
<P>While we were thus engaged, in concerting &s;ome plan for our future operations, a very nume|rous concour&s;e of the natives &s;till kept po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;hore; and &s;ome of them, coining off in canoes, approached within pi&s;tol-&s;hot of the &s;hips, and in&s;ulted us by various marks of defiance and contempt. It was extremely difficult to re&s;train the &s;eamen from the u&s;e of their arms on the&s;e occa&s;ions; but, as pacific mea&s;ures had been re|&s;olved
<PB N="217" REF="030274_1047_0FE575A1628376E8">
on, the canoes were allowed to return unmole&s;ted.</P>
<P>Mr. King was now ordered to proceed towards the &s;hore, with the boats of both &s;hips, well manned and armed, with a view of bringing the i&s;landers to a parley, and of obtaining, if po&s;&s;ible, a conferrence with &s;ome of the <HI>Erees.</HI> If he &s;hould &s;ucceed in this attempt, he was to demand the dead bodies, and particularly that of Captain Cook; to threaten them, in ca&s;e of a refu&s;al, with our re&s;entment; but by no means to fire, unle&s;s attacked, and not to go a&s;hore on any account whatever. The&s;e in&s;tructions were delivered to Mr. King before the whole party, in the mo&s;t po&s;itive manner.</P>
<P>Mr. King and his detatchment left the &s;hips about four o'clock in the afternoon; and, as they approached the &s;hore, they perceived every in|dication of a ho&s;tile reception. The natives were all in motion; the women and children retiring; the men arming them&s;elves with long &s;pears and daggers, and putting on their war-mats. It al&s;o appeared, that, &s;ince the morning, they had thrown up brea&s;t-works of &s;tone along the beach, where Captain Cook had landed; in expectation, perhaps, of an attack at that place.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as our party were within reach, the i&s;landers began to throw &s;tones at them with &s;lings, but without doing any mi&s;chief. Mr. King concluded, from the&s;e appearances, that all
<PB N="218" REF="030274_1048_0FE5752F4D17AB58">
attempts to bring them to a parley would be in effectual, unle&s;s he gave them &s;ome ground for mutual confidence: he therefore ordered the armed boats to &s;top, and advanced alone, in the &s;mall boat, holding in his hand a white flag; the meaning of which, from an uni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">er&s;al &s;hout of joy from the natives, he had the &s;atisfaction to find was immediately under&s;tood. The women in|&s;tantly returned from the &s;ide of the hill, whither they had retired; the men threw of their mats and all &s;eated them&s;elves together by the &s;ea-&s;ide, extending their arms, and inviting Mr. King to land.</P>
<P>Though &s;uch behaviour &s;eemed expre&s;&s;ive of a friendly di&s;po&s;ition, he could not avoid entertain|ing &s;u&s;picions of its &s;incerity. But when he &s;aw Koah, with extraordinary boldne&s;s and a&s;&s;urance &s;wimming off towards the boat, with a white flag in his hand, he thought proper to return this mark of confidence, and accordingly received him into the boat, though he was armed; a circum|&s;tance which did not contribute to le&s;&s;en Mr. King's &s;u&s;picions. He had, indeed, long har|boured an unfavourable opinion of Koah. The prie&s;ts had always repre&s;ented him as a per&s;on of a malicious temper, and no friend to us; and the repeated detections of his fraud and treachery, had convinced us of the truth of their a&s;&s;ertions. Be&s;ides, the melancholy tran&s;actions of the morn-part,
<PB N="219" REF="030274_1049_0FE575F8C80A8090">
in&s;pired Mr. King with the utmo&s;t horror at finding him&s;elf &s;o near him; and as he ap|proached him, with &s;eigned tears, and embraced him, Mr. King was &s;o di&s;tru&s;tful of his intentions that he took hold of the point of the <HI>phaooa,</HI> which the chief held in his hand and turned it from him. He informed the i&s;lander, that he had come to demand the body of Captain Cook and to declare war again&s;t the natives, unle&s;s it was re&s;tored without delay. Koah a&s;&s;ured him that this &s;hould be done as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, and that he would go him&s;elf for that purpo&s;e; and after reque&s;ting a piece of iron of Mr. King, with marks of great a&s;&s;urance, he leaped into the water, and &s;wam a&s;hore, calling out to his countrymen, that we were all friends again.</P>
<P>Our people waited with great anxiety, near an hour, for his return. During this interval, the other boats had approached &s;o near the &s;hore, that the men who were in them entered into conver&s;a|tion with a party of the i&s;landers, at a little di&s;|tance; by whom they were informed, that the Captains body had been cut to pieces, and car|ried up the country; but of this circum&s;tance, Mr. King was not apprized till his return to the &s;hips.</P>
<P>Mr. King now began to expre&s;s &s;ome degree of impatience at Koah's delay; upon which the chiefs pre&s;&s;ed him exceedingly to land; a&s;&s;uring him, that, if he would go in per&s;on to Terreeo|him.
<PB N="220" REF="030274_1050_0FE575D405AB6A80">
When they found they could not prevail on Mr. King to go a&s;hore, they endeavoured, on pretence of conver&s;ing with him with greater ca&s;e, to decoy his boat among &s;ome rocks, where they might have had it in their power to &s;eparate him from the other boats. It was ea&s;y to &s;ee through the&s;e artifices, and he was, therefore, very de&s;irous of breaking off all communication with them, when a chief approached, who had particulary attached him&s;elf to Captain Clerke, and the officers of the Di&s;covery, on board which &s;hip he had &s;ailed, when we la&s;t quitted the bay, intending to take his pa&s;&s;age to the i&s;land of Mowee. He &s;aid <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> came from Terreeoboo, to acquaint our people that the body was carried up the country, but that it &s;hould be brought back the following morning. There appeared much &s;incerity in his manner; and being a&s;ked, if he uttered a fal&s;ehood, he hooked together his two fore fingers, which is here under&s;tood as the &s;ign of veracity, in the u&s;e of which the&s;e i&s;landers are very &s;crupulous.</P>
<P>Mr. King being now at a lo&s;s how to proceed, &s;ent Mr. Vancouver to inform Captain Clerke of all that had pa&s;&s;ed; that it was his opinion, the natives did not intend to keep their word with us; and, far from being grieved at what had hap|pened, were, on the contrary, in&s;pired with great confidence on account of their late &s;ucce&s;s, and &s;ought only to gain time, till they could plan &s;ome
<PB N="221" REF="030274_1051_0FE575E4849687B0">
&s;cheme for getting our people into their power. Mr. Vancouver came back with orders for Mr. King to return on board, after giving the i&s;landers to under&s;tand, that if the body was not re&s;tored the next morning, the town &s;hould be de&s;troyed.</P>
<P>When they perceived our party retiring, they endeavoured to provoke them by the mo&s;t con|temptuous and in&s;ulting ge&s;tures. Several of our people &s;aid, they could di&s;tingui&s;h &s;ome of the natives parading about in the cloaths which had belonged to our unhappy countrymen, and among them, an <HI>Eree</HI> brandi&s;hing Captain Cook's hanger and a woman holding the &s;cabbard.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of Mr. King's report to Cap|tain Clerke, of what he &s;uppo&s;ed to be the pre|&s;ent temper and di&s;po&s;ition of the inhabitants, the mo&s;t effectual methods were taken to guard again&s;t any attack they might make during the night. The boats were moored with top-chains; additional &s;entinels were &s;tationed in each of our &s;hips; and guard-boats were directed to row round them, in order to prevent the i&s;landers from cut|ting the cables.</P>
<P>In the night, we &s;aw a va&s;t number of lights on the hills, which induced &s;ome of us to ima|gine, that they were removing their effects far|ther up into the country, in con&s;equence of our menaces. But it &s;eems more probable, that they were kindled at the &s;acrifices that were perform|ing on account of the war, in which they &s;uppo&s;ed
<PB N="222" REF="030274_1052_0FE575E153B91A50">
them&s;elves likely to be engaged&punc; and, perhaps, the bodies of our &s;lain countrymen were, at that time, burning. We afterwards ob&s;erved fires of the &s;ame kind, as we pa&s;&s;ed the i&s;land of Mo|rotoi; and which, according to the information we received from &s;ome of the natives then on board, were made on account of a war they had declared again&s;t a neighbouring i&s;land. This agrees with what we learned among the Friendly and Society I&s;les, that, previous to any ho&s;tile ex|pedition, the chiefs always endeavoured to animate the courage of the people, by fea&s;ts and rejoicings in the night.</P>
<P>We pa&s;&s;ed the night without any di&s;turbance, except from the howlings and lamentations which were heard on &s;hore. Early the next morning, (Monday the 15th) Koah came along-&s;ide the Re&s;olution, with a &s;mall pig, and &s;ome cloth, which he de&s;ired permi&s;&s;ion to pre&s;ent to Mr. King. We have already mentioned, that this officer was &s;uppo&s;ed, by the i&s;landers, to be the &s;on of Captain Cook; and as the latter had al|ways &s;uffered them to believe it, Mr. King was probably con&s;idered as the chief after his death. As &s;oon as he came on deck, he interrogated Koah with regard to the body; and, on his re|turning eva&s;ive an&s;wers, refu&s;ed to accept his pre|&s;ents; and was on the point of di&s;mi&s;&s;ing him with expre&s;&s;ions of anger and re&s;entment, had not Captain Clerke, with a view of keeping up
<PB N="223" REF="030274_1053_0FE57597252381E0">
the appearance of friend&s;hip, judged it more pro|per, that he &s;hould be treated with the cu&s;tomary re&s;pect.</P>
<P>This chief came frequently to us in the cour&s;e of the morning, with &s;ome trifling pre&s;ent or other; and as we always ob&s;erved him eyeing every part of the &s;hip with a great degree of at|tention, we took care he &s;hould &s;ee we were well prepared for our defence.</P>
<P>He was extremely urgent both with Captain Clerke and Mr. King to go on &s;hore, imputing the detention of the bodies to the other chiefs; and a&s;&s;uring tho&s;e gentlemen, that every thing might be adju&s;ted to their &s;atisfaction, by a per|&s;onal interview with the king. However, they did not think it prudent to comply with Koah's reque&s;t; and, indeed, a fact came afterwards to their knowledge, which proved his want of vera|city. For, they were informed, that, immedi|ately after the action in which Captain Cook had lo&s;t his life, Terreeoboo had retired to a cave in the &s;teep part of a mountain, that hangs over the bay, which was acce&s;&s;ible only by means of ropes, and where he continued for &s;everal days, having his provi&s;ions let down to him by cords</P>
<P>After the departure of Koah from the &s;hips, we ob&s;erved that his countrymen, who had a&s;|&s;embled by day-break, in va&s;t crowds on the &s;hore, flocked around him with great eagerne&s;s on his landing, as if they wi&s;hed to learn the in|telligence
<PB N="224" REF="030274_1054_0FE575A71AC9B638">
he had gained, and what &s;teps were to be taken in con&s;equence of it. It is highly pro|bable, that they expected we &s;hould attempt to put our threats in execution; and they appeared fully determined to &s;tand their ground. During the whole morning, we heard conchs blowing in various parts of the coa&s;t; large parties were per|ceived marching over the hills; and, upon the whole, appearances were &s;o alarming, that we carried out a &s;tream anchor, for the purpo&s;e of hauling the &s;hip abrea&s;t of the town, in ca&s;e of an attack; and boats were &s;tationed off the north|ern point of the bay, in order to prevent a &s;ur|prize from the natives in that quarter.</P>
<P>The warlike po&s;ture in which they appeared at pre&s;ent, and the breach of their engagement to re&s;tore the bodies of the &s;lain, occa&s;ioned fre&s;h debates among us, concerning the mea&s;ures which &s;hould now be pur&s;ued. It was at length deter|mined, that nothing &s;hould be permitted to in|terfere with the repair of the Re&s;olution's ma&s;t, and the preparations for our departure; but that we &s;hould, neverthele&s;s, continue our negocia|tions for the re&s;toration of the bodies of our coun|trymen.</P>
<P>The greater part of the day was employed in getting the fore-ma&s;t in a proper &s;ituation on deck, that the carpenters might work upon it and al&s;o in making the requi&s;ite alteration in the commi&s;&s;ions of the officers. The chief command
<PB N="225" REF="030274_1055_0FE575B6400A77B0">
of the expedition having devolved on Captain Clerke, he removed on board the Re&s;olution, promoted Lieutenant Gore to the rank of Captain of the Di&s;covery, appointed Me&s;&s;rs King and William&s;on fir&s;t and &s;econd Lieutenants of the Re&s;olution, and nominated Mr. Harvey, a Mid|&s;hipman, who had accompanied Captain Cook during his two la&s;t voyages, to fill the vacant lieutenancy. During the whole day, we &s;u&s;tained no interruption from the i&s;landers; and, in the evening, the launch was moored with a top-chain, and guard-boats &s;tationed round each of the &s;hips as before.</P>
<P>About eight o'clock, it being exceedingly dark, we heard a canoe paddling towards the &s;hip; and it was no &s;ooner perceived, than both the &s;entinels on deck fired into it. There were two of the natives in this canoe, who immediately roared out "<HI>Tinnee,</HI>" (which was their method of pronouncing Mr. King's name), and &s;aid they were friends, and had &s;omething with them which belonged to Captain Cook. When they came on board, they threw them&s;elves at the feet of our officers, and &s;eemed to be extremely terrified. It fortunately happened, that neither of them was hurt, notwith&s;tanding the ball of both pieces had gone through the canoe.</P>
<P>One of them was the per&s;on, who has been al|ready mentioned, under the appellation of the <HI>taboo</HI> man, who con&s;tantly attended Captain Cook
<PB N="226" REF="030274_1056_0FE575A89F66BDF8">
with the particular ceremonies we have before de|&s;cribed; and who, though a man of di&s;tinction in the i&s;land, could &s;carcely be prevented from performing for him the mo&s;t humiliating offices of a menial &s;ervant. After bewailing, with many tears, the lo&s;s of the <HI>Orono,</HI> he informed us, that he had brought a part of his body. He then gave us a &s;mall bundle which he brought under his arm; and it is impo&s;&s;ible to de&s;cribe the hor|ror with which we were &s;eized, upon finding in it, a piece of human fle&s;h, of the weight of about nine or ten pounds. This, he &s;aid, was all that now remained of the body; that the re&s;t had been cut in pieces, and burnt; but that the head, and all the bones, except tho&s;e which belonged to the trunk, were in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Terreeoboo and the other chiefs; that what we &s;aw had been allotted to Kaoo, the chief of the prie&s;ts, for the purpo&s;e of being u&s;ed in &s;ome religious ceremo|ny; and that he had &s;ent it as a te&s;timony of his innocence, and of his attachment to us.</P>
<P>We had now an opportunity of learning whe|ther they were cannibals; and we did not neglect to avail our&s;elves of it. We fir&s;t endeavoured, by &s;everal indirect que&s;tions, but to each of them apart, to gain information re&s;pecting the man|ner in which the other bodies had been treated and di&s;po&s;ed of; and, finding them very con&s;tant in one account, that, after the fle&s;h had been cut off, the whole of it was burnt; we at la&s;t put the
<PB N="227" REF="030274_1057_0FE575B7CA70E9A0">
direct que&s;tion, whether they had not fed on &s;ome of it? they immediately te&s;tified as much horror at &s;uch an idea, as any European would have done; and a&s;ked, whether that was the prac|tice among us. They afterwards a&s;ked us, with great earne&s;tne&s;s, and with an appearance of ap|prehen&s;ion, when the <HI>Orono</HI> would come again? and how he would treat them on his return; the &s;ame inquiry was often made in the &s;equel by others; and this idea is con&s;i&s;tent with the gene|ral tenour of their conduct towards him, which indicated, that they con&s;idered him as a being of a &s;uperior &s;pecies.</P>
<P>Though we pre&s;&s;ed our two friendly vi&s;itants to continue on board till the next morning, we could not prevail upon them. They informed us, that, if this tran&s;action &s;hould come to the knowledge of the king, or any of the other <HI>Erees,</HI> it might be attended with the mo&s;t fatal con&s;e|quences to their whole &s;ociety; to prevent which, they had been&punc; under the nece&s;&s;ity of coming to us in the dark; and the &s;ame precaution, they &s;aid, would be requi&s;ite in returning on &s;hore. They further told us, that the chiefs were eager to take revenge on us for the death of their coun|trymen; and particularly cautioned us again&s;t tru&s;ting Koah, who, they a&s;&s;ured us, was our implacable enemy; and ardently longed for an opportunity of fighting us, to which the blowing
<PB N="228" REF="030274_1058_0FE575E60BC23D18">
of the conchs, that we had heard in the morning was intended as a challenge.</P>
<P>It al&s;o appeared from the information of the&s;e men, that &s;eventeen of their countrymen were &s;lain, in the fir&s;t action, at the village of Kowro|wa, five of whom were chiefs; and that Kaneena and his brother, our particular friends, were of that number. Eight, they &s;aid, had lo&s;t their lives at the ob&s;ervatory; three of whom likewi&s;e were per&s;ons of the fir&s;t di&s;tinction.</P>
<P>The two natives left us about eleven o'clock, and took the precaution to de&s;ire, that one of or guard-boats might attend them, till they had pa&s;&s;ed the Di&s;covery, le&s;t they &s;hould again be fired upon, which by alarming their countrymen on &s;hore, might expo&s;e them to the danger of detection. This reque&s;t was readily complied with, and we had the &s;atisfaction to find, that they reached the land &s;afe and undi&s;covered.</P>
<P>We heard, during the remainder of this night, the &s;ame loud lamentations, as in the preceding one. Early the following morning, we received a vi&s;it from Koah. Mr. King was piqued at find|ing, that notwith&s;tanding the mo&s;t glaring marks of treachery in his conduct, and the po&s;itive de|claration of our friends the prie&s;ts, he &s;hould &s;till be &s;uffered to carry on the &s;ame farce, and to make us at lea&s;t appear the dupes of his hypo|cri&s;y. Our &s;ituation was, indeed; become ex|tremely aukward and unpromi&s;ing; none of the
<PB N="229" REF="030274_1059_0FE548D7DA70E008">
purpo&s;es for which this pacific plan of proceed|ings had been adopted, having hitherto been, in any re&s;pect, promoted by it. No &s;atisfactory an|&s;wer had been given to our demands; we did not &s;eem to have made any progre&s;s towards a recon|ciliation with the natives; they &s;till remained on the &s;hore in ho&s;tile po&s;tures, as if determined to oppo&s;e any endeavours we might make to go a&s;hore; and yet it was become ab&s;olutely nece&s;|&s;ary to attempt landing, as the completing our &s;tock of water would not admit of any longer delay.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t remark, however, in ju&s;tice to the conduct of Captain Clerke, that it was highly probable, from the great numbers of the i&s;landers, and from the re&s;olution with which they &s;eemed to expect our approach, that an attack could not have been made without danger; and that the lo&s;s of even a very few men, might have been &s;everely felt by us, during the remainder of our voyage; whereas the delaying to put our menaces into execution, though, on the one hand, it di|mini&s;hed their opinion of our valour, had the ef|fect of occa&s;ioning them to di&s;per&s;e on the other. For this day, about twelve o'clock, upon finding that we per&s;i&s;ted, in our inactivity, great bodies of them, after blowing their conchs, and u&s;ing every method of defiance, marched off, over the hills, and never made their appearance afterwards. Tho&s;e, however, who remained, were not the
<PB N="230" REF="030274_1060_0FE5759E55407DA0">
le&s;s daring and pre&s;umptuous. One of them had the in&s;olence to come within mu&s;quet-&s;hot, a|head of the Re&s;olution, and, after throwing &s;eve|ral &s;tones at us, waved over his head the hat which had belonged to Captain Cook, while his countrymen a-&s;hore were exulting and encourag|ing his audacity.</P>
<P>Our people were highly enraged at this in&s;ult, and coming in a body on the quarter deck, begged they might no longer be obliged to put up with &s;uch reiterated provocations, and reque&s;ted Mr. King to endeavour to obtain permi&s;&s;ion for them, from Captain Clerke, to take advantage of the fir&s;t fair occa&s;ion of avenging the death of their much-lamented Commander. On Mr. King's acquainting the Captain with what was pa&s;&s;ing, he ordered &s;ome great guns to be fired at the i&s;landers on &s;hore; and promi&s;ed the crew, that, if they &s;hould be mole&s;ted at the watering-place, the next day, they &s;hould then be permitted to cha&s;ti&s;e them.</P>
<P>Before we could bring our guns to bear, the natives had &s;u&s;pected our intentions, from the bu&s;tle and agitation they ob&s;erved in the &s;hip; and had retired behind their hou&s;es and walls. We were con&s;equently obliged to fire, in &s;ome degree at random; notwith&s;tanding which, our &s;hot produced all the effects we could de&s;ire. For, in a &s;hort time afterwards, we perceived Koah paddling towards us, with the greate&s;t ha&s;te;
<PB N="231" REF="030274_1061_0FE575B4B292B378">
and when he arrived, we learned, that &s;ome peo|ple had lo&s;t their lives, and among the re&s;t Maiha|maiha, a principal <HI>Eree</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the language of the&s;e i&s;lands, the word <HI>matee</HI> is generally u&s;ed either to expre&s;s killing or wounding; and we were afterwards inform|ed, that this chief had only received a trifling blow on the face, from a &s;tone which had been &s;truck by one of our balls.</NOTE>, nearly related to Ter|reeoboo.</P>
<P>Not long after Koah's arrival, two boys &s;wam off from the <HI>morai</HI> towards our ve&s;&s;els, each armed with a long &s;pear; and after, they had approach|ed pretty near, they began, in a very &s;olemn manner, to chant a &s;ong; the &s;ubject of which, from their frequently mentioning the word <HI>Orono,</HI> and pointing to the village where Captain Cook had been &s;lain, we concluded to be the late ca|lamitous occurrence. Having &s;ung for near a quarter of an hour in a plaintive &s;train, during all which time they continued in the water, they repaired on board the Di&s;covery, and delivered up their &s;pears; and, after remaining there a &s;hort time, returned on &s;hore. We could never learn who &s;ent them, or what was the object of this ceremony.</P>
<P>During the night we took the u&s;ual precautions for the &s;ecurity of the &s;hips; and, as &s;oon as it was dark, the two natives, who had vi&s;ited us the preceeding evening, came off to us again. They a&s;&s;ured us, that though the effects of our
<PB N="232" REF="030274_1062_0FE5759CAF779C80">
great guns, this afternoon, had greatly alarmed the chiefs, they had by no means relinqui&s;hed their ho&s;tile intentions, and they advi&s;ed us to be on our guard.</P>
<P>The following morning, which was the 17th, the boats of both &s;hips were di&s;patched a&s;hore to procure water; and the Di&s;covery was warped clo&s;e to the beach, in order to protect the per&s;ons employed in that &s;ervice. We &s;oon found that the intelligence which had been &s;ent us by the prie&s;ts, was not de&s;titute of foundation, and that the i&s;landers were determined to neglect no op|portunity of annoying us, when it could be done without much hazard.</P>
<P>The villages, throughout this whole clu&s;ter of i&s;lands, are, for the mo&s;t part, &s;ituated near the &s;ea; and the adjacent ground is enclo&s;ed with &s;tone walls, of the height of about three feet. The&s;e, we at fir&s;t &s;uppo&s;ed, were de&s;igned for the divi&s;ion of property; but we now di&s;covered that they &s;erved for a defence again&s;t inva&s;ion, for which purpo&s;e they were, perhaps, chiefly in|tended. They con&s;i&s;t of loo&s;e &s;tones, and the natives are very dexterous in &s;hifting them, with great quickne&s;s, to &s;uch particular &s;ituations, as the direction of the attack may occa&s;ionally re|quire. In the &s;ides of the mountain, that &s;tands near the bay, they have likewi&s;e holes, or caves, of con&s;iderable depth; who&s;e entrance is &s;ecured by a fence of a &s;imilar kind. From behind both
<PB N="233" REF="030274_1063_0FE5753D8847CBF8">
the&s;e &s;tations, the i&s;landers perpetually harra&s;&s;ed our watering party with &s;tones; nor could the in|con&s;iderable force we had on &s;hore, with the ad|vantage of mu&s;quets, compel them to retreat.</P>
<P>Thus oppo&s;ed, our people were &s;o occupied in attending to their own &s;afety, that, during the whole forenoon, they filled only one ton of wa|ter. It being therefore impo&s;&s;ible for them to perform this &s;ervice, till their a&s;&s;ailants were driven to a greater di&s;tance, the Di&s;covery was or|dered to di&s;lodge the enemy with her great guns; which being accompli&s;hed by means of a few di&s;|charges, the men landed without mole&s;tation.</P>
<P>The natives, however, made their appearance again, &s;oon afterwards, in their u&s;ual method of attack; and it was now deemed ab&s;olutely nece&s;|&s;ary to burn down &s;ome &s;traggling huts, near the wall behind which they had &s;heltered them&s;elves. In executing the orders that were given for that purpo&s;e, our people were hurried into acts of un|nece&s;&s;ary deva&s;tation and cruelty. Some allow|ance ought certainly to be made for their re&s;ent|ment of the repeated in&s;ults, and contemptuous behaviour of the i&s;landers, and for their natural de&s;ire of revenging the death of their beloved and re&s;pected Commander. But, at the &s;ame time, their conduct &s;trongly evinced, that the greate&s;t precaution is requi&s;ite in tru&s;ting, even for a mo|ment, the di&s;cretionary u&s;e of arms, in the hands of private &s;oldiers, or &s;eamen, on &s;uch occa&s;ions.
<PB N="234" REF="030274_1064_0FE575AC20517BB8">
The &s;trictne&s;s of di&s;cipline, and the habits of obedience, by which their force is kept directed to &s;uitable objects, lead them to conceive, that whenever they have the power, they have like|wi&s;e a right to perform. Actual di&s;obedience be|ing almo&s;t the only crime for which they expect to receive puni&s;hment, they are apt to con&s;ider it as the &s;ole mea&s;ure of right and wrong; and hence they are too ready to conclude, that what they can do with impunity, they may al&s;o do con|&s;i&s;tently with honour and ju&s;tice; &s;o that the feelings of humanity, and that genero&s;ity towards an unre&s;i&s;ting enemy, which, at other times, is a &s;triking di&s;tinction of brave men, become but feeble re&s;traints to the exerci&s;e of violence, when &s;et in oppo&s;ition to the de&s;ire they naturally have of &s;hewing their own power and independence.</P>
<P>It has been before ob&s;erved, that directions had been given to burn only a few &s;traggling hou&s;es, which afforded &s;helter to the i&s;landers. We were therefore greatly &s;urpri&s;ed on perceiving the whole village in flames; and before a boat, that was &s;ent to &s;top the progre&s;s of the mi&s;chief, could reach the land, the habitations of our old and con&s;tant friends, the prie&s;ts, were all on fire. Mr. King had, therefore, great rea&s;on to lament the illne&s;s that confined him on board this day. The prie&s;ts had always been under his protection; and, unfortunately, the officers then on duty having &s;eldom been on &s;hore at the <HI>morai,</HI> were but lit|tle
<PB N="235" REF="030274_1065_0FE575DA06CFAED0">
acquainted with the circum&s;tances of the place. Had he been pre&s;ent him&s;elf, he might in all probability, have been the means of pre&s;erving their little &s;ociety from de&s;truction.</P>
<P>In e&s;caping from the flames, &s;everal of the inhabitants were &s;hot; and our people cut off the heads of two of them, and brought them on board. The fate of one unhappy native was much la|mented by all of us. As he was repairing to the well for water, he was &s;hot at by one of the marines. The ball happened to &s;trike his cali|ba&s;h, which he in&s;tantly threw from him, and ran off. He was pur&s;ued into one of the caves above-mentioned, and no lion could have defend|ed his den with greater bravery and fiercene&s;s; till at length, after he had found means to keep two of our people at bay for a con&s;iderable time, he expired, covered with wounds. This accident fir&s;t brought us acquainted with the u&s;e to which the&s;e caverns are applied.</P>
<P>About this time a man, advanced in years, was taken pri&s;oner, bound, and conveyed on board the Re&s;olution, in the &s;ame boat, with the heads of his two countrymen. We never ob&s;erved horror &s;o &s;trongly portrayed, as in the face of this per&s;on, nor &s;o violent a tran&s;ition to immo|derate joy, as when he was untied, and given to under&s;tand, that he might depart in &s;afety. He &s;hewed us that he was not deficient in gratitude,
<PB N="236" REF="030274_1066_0FE575C3030AAFC0">
as he not only often returned afterwards with pre|&s;ents of provi&s;ions, but, al&s;o did us other &s;ervices.</P>
<P>In a &s;hort time after the de&s;truction of the vil|lage, we &s;aw coming down the hill, a man, ac|companied by fifteen or twenty boys, who held in their hands pieces of white cloth, plantains, green boughs, &amp;c. It happened that this pacific emba&s;&s;y, as &s;oon as they were within reach, re|ceived the fire of a party of our men. This, however, did not deter them from continuing their proce&s;&s;ion, and the officer on duty came up in time, to prevent a &s;econd di&s;charge. As they made a nearer approach, the principal per&s;on proved to be our friend Kaireckeea, who had fled when our people fir&s;t &s;et fire to the village, and had now returned, and expre&s;&s;ed his de&s;ire of be|ing &s;ent on board the Re&s;olution.</P>
<P>On his arrival we found him extremely thought|ful and grave. We endeavoured to convince him of the nece&s;&s;ity there was of &s;etting fire to the village, by which his hou&s;e, and tho&s;e of his brethren were unintentionally de&s;troyed. He ex|po&s;tulated with us on our ingratitude and want of friend&s;hip; and indeed, it was not till the pre|&s;ent moment, that we knew the whole extent of the injury that had been done them. He in|formed us, that, confiding in the promi&s;es Mr. King had made them, and as well as in the a&s;|&s;urances they had received from the men, who had brought us &s;ome of Captain Cook's remains,
<PB N="237" REF="030274_1067_0FE575CF4AB5CE58">
they had not removed their effects back into the country, as the other inhabitants had done, but had put every valuable article of their own, as well as what they had collected from us, into a hou&s;e adjoining the <HI>morai,</HI> where they had the mortification to &s;ee it all &s;et on fire by our people. He had, on coming on board, perceived the heads of his two countrymen lying on deck, at which he was greatly &s;hocked, and earne&s;tly de&s;ired that they might be thrown over-board. This reque&s;t, by the directions of Captain Clerke, was immediately complied with.</P>
<P>Our watering party returned on board in the evening, having &s;u&s;tained no farther interruption. We pa&s;&s;ed a di&s;agreeable night; the cries and lamentations we heard from the &s;hore being far more dreadful than ever. Our only con&s;olation, on this occa&s;ion, aro&s;e from the hopes that a re|petition of &s;uch &s;everities might not be requi&s;ite in future.</P>
<P>It is remarkable, that amid&s;t all the&s;e di&s;turb|ances, the female natives who were on board, did not offer to leave us, or di&s;cover any apprehen|&s;ions either for them&s;elves or their friends on &s;hore. They appeared, indeed, &s;o perfectly un|concerned, that &s;ome of them, who were on deck when the village was in flames, &s;eemed to admire the &s;pectacle, and frequently exclaimed, that it was <HI>maitai,</HI> or very fine.</P>
<P><PB N="238" REF="030274_1068_0FE575C9A08823E8">The next morning the treacherous Koah came off to the &s;hips, as u&s;ual. There being no longer any nece&s;&s;ity for keeping terms with him, Mr. King was allowed to treat him as he thought pro|per. When he approached the &s;ide of the Re|&s;olution, &s;inging a &s;ong, and offering a hog, and &s;ome plantains, to Mr. King, the latter ordered him to keep off, and cautioned him never to make his appearance again without the bones of Captain Cook, le&s;t his life &s;hould pay the forfeit of his repeated breach of faith. He did not appear much mortified with this unwelcome reception, but immediately returned on &s;hore, and joined a party of his countrymen, who were throwing &s;tones at our waterers. The body of the young man, who had been killed the preceding day, was found this morning lying at the entrance of the cave; and a mat was thrown over him by &s;ome of our people; &s;oon after which they &s;aw &s;everal of the natives carrying him off on their &s;houlders, and could hear them chanting, as they marched, a mournful &s;ong.</P>
<P>The i&s;landers being at length convinced that it was not the want of ability to cha&s;tize them which had induced us at fir&s;t to tolerate their provocations, de&s;i&s;ted from mole&s;ting our people; and, towards the evening, a chief, named Eap|po, who had &s;eldom vi&s;ited us, but whom we knew to be a man of the fir&s;t di&s;tinction, came with pre&s;ence from Terreeoboo to &s;ue for peace.
<PB N="239" REF="030274_1069_0FE575FA4E425848">
The&s;e pre&s;ents were accepted, and the chief was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed with the following an&s;wer: That no peace would be granted, till the remains of Captain Cook &s;hould be re&s;tored.</P>
<P>We were informed by Eappo, that the fle&s;h of all the bones of our people who had been &s;lain, as well as the bones of the trunks, had been burnt; that the limb-bones of the marines had been di&s;|tributed among the inferior chiefs; and that the remains of Captain Cook had been di&s;po&s;ed of as follows: the head to a great <HI>Erce</HI> called Kahoo|opeou; the hair to Maiha-maiha; and the arms, legs, and thighs, to Terreeoboo. After it was dark, many of the natives came off with various &s;orts of vegetables; and we al&s;o received from Kaireekeea two large pre&s;ents of the &s;ame articles.</P>
<P>The next day was principally employed in &s;ending and receiving the me&s;&s;ages that pa&s;&s;ed between Captain Clerke and the old king. Eappo was very urgent, that one of our officers &s;hould go on &s;hore; and offered to remain on board, in the mean time, as an ho&s;tage. This reque&s;t, however, was not complied with; and he left us with a promi&s;e of bringing the bones the follow|ing day. Our watering party, at the beach, did not meet with the lea&s;t oppo&s;ition from the i&s;landers; who, notwith&s;tanding our cautious be|haviour, again ventured them&s;elves among&s;t us without any marks of diffidence or apprehen&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="240" REF="030274_1070_0FE57572F542BC30">On Saturday the 20th, early in the morning we had the &s;atisfaction of getting the fore-ma&s;t &s;tepped.

<P>This morning, between the hours of ten and eleven, we &s;aw a numerous body of the natives de&s;cending the hill, which is over the beach, in a &s;ort of proce&s;&s;ion, each man carrying on his &s;houlders two or three &s;ugar-canes, and &s;ome bread-fruit, plantains, and taro, in his hand. They were preceeded by two drummers, who, when they reached the water-&s;ide, &s;eated them|&s;elves by a white flag, and began beating their drums, while tho&s;e who had followed them, ad|vanced, one by one, and depo&s;ited the pre&s;ents they had brought with them; after which they retired in the &s;ame order. Soon afterwards Eappo appeared in his long feathered cloak, bearing &s;omething with great &s;olemnity in his hands; and having &s;tationed him&s;elf on a rock, he made &s;igns that a boat &s;hould be &s;ent him.</P>
<P>Captain Clerke, &s;uppo&s;ing that the chief had brought the bones of Captain Cook (which, in|deed, proved to be the ca&s;e), went him&s;elf in the pinnace to receive them, and ordered Mr. King to attend him in the cutter. When they arrived at the beach, Eappo, entering the pinnace, de|livered the bones to Captain Clerke, wrapped up
<PB N="241" REF="030274_1071_0FE57546776D06A0">
in a great quantity of fine new cloth, and covered with a &s;potted cloak of black and white feathers. He afterwards attended our gentlemen to the Re&s;olution, but could not be prevailed on to ac|company them on board; being, perhaps, from a &s;en&s;e of decency, unwilling to be pre&s;ent at the opening of the parcel.</P>
<P>We found, in this bundle, both the hands of Captain Cook entire, which were well known to us from a &s;car on one of them, that divided the fore finger from the thumb, the whole length of the metacarpal bone; the &s;kull, but with the &s;calp &s;eparated from it, and the bones of the face wanting; the &s;calp, with the ears adhering to it, and the hair upon it cut &s;hort; the bones of both the arms, with the &s;kin of the fore-arms hanging to them; the bones of the thighs and legs joined together, but without the feet. The ligaments of the joints were ob&s;erved to be entire; and the whole &s;hewed &s;ufficient marks of having been in the fire, except the hands, which had the fle&s;h remaining upon them, and were cut in &s;everal places, and crammed with &s;alt, mo&s;t probably with a view of pre&s;erving them. The &s;kull was free from any fracture, but the &s;calp had a cut in the back part of it. The lower jaw and feet, which were wanting, had been &s;eized, as Eappo in|formed us, by different <HI>Erees;</HI> and he al&s;o told us, that Terreeoboo was u&s;ing every means to recover them.</P>
<P><PB N="242" REF="030274_1072_0FE5757A81DA8490">Eappo, and the king's &s;on, came on board the next morning, and brought with them not only the remaining bones of Captain Cook, but like|wi&s;e the barrels of his gun, his &s;hoes, and &s;ome other trifles which had belonged to him. Eappo a&s;&s;ured us, that Terreeoboo, Maiha-maiha, and him&s;elf were extremely de&s;irous of peace; that they had given us the mo&s;t convincing proofs of it; and that they had been prevented from giving it &s;ooner by the other chiefs, many of whom were &s;till di&s;affected to us. He lamented, with the mo&s;t lively &s;orrow, the death of &s;ix chiefs, who had been killed by our people; &s;ome of whom, he &s;aid, were among our be&s;t friends. He in|formed us, that the cutter had been taken away by Pareea's people, probably in revenge for the blow that he had received; and that it had been broken up the following day. The arms of the marines, which we had al&s;o demanded, had been carried off, he &s;aid, by the populace, and were irrecoverable.</P>
<P>Nothing now remained, but to perform the la&s;t &s;olemn offices to our excellent Commander. Eappo was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed with orders to <HI>taboo</HI> all the bay; and, in the afternoon, the bones having been depo&s;ited in a coffin, the funeral &s;ervice was read over them, and they were committed to the deep with the u&s;ual military honours. Our feel|ings, on this mournful occa&s;ion, are more ea&s;y to be conceived than expre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P><PB N="243" REF="030274_1073_0FE5754802529AC0">During the morning of the 22d, not a canoe was &s;een in the bay. The <HI>taboo,</HI> which Eappo, at our de&s;ire, had laid on it the preceding day, not being yet taken off. At length that chief came off to us. We a&s;&s;ured him, that we were now perfectly &s;atisfied; and that, as the <HI>Orono</HI> was buried, all remembrance of the late unhappy tran&s;actions was buried with him. We after|wards reque&s;ted him to take off the <HI>taboo,</HI> and to make it known, that the i&s;landers might bring provi&s;ions to us as u&s;ual. The &s;hips were &s;oon &s;urrounded with canoes, and many of the <HI>Erees</HI> came on board, expre&s;&s;ing their grief at what had happened, and their &s;atisfaction at our reconci|liation. Several of our friends, who did not fa|vour us with a vi&s;it, &s;ent pre&s;ents of large hogs, and other provi&s;ions. Among the re&s;t, the old treacherous Koah came off to us, but we refu&s;ed him admittance.</P>
<P>As we were now prepared for putting to &s;ea, Captain Clerke imagining, that, if the intelligence of our proceedings &s;hould reach the i&s;lands to leeward before us, it might have a bad effect, gave orders, that the &s;hips &s;hould be unmoored. About eight in the evening, we di&s;mi&s;&s;ed all the natives; and Eappo, and the friendly Kaireekeea, took their leave of us in a very affectionate man|ner. We immediately weighed anchor, and &s;tood out of Karakakooa bay. The i&s;landers were a&s;|&s;embled in great numbers on the &s;hore; and, as
<PB N="244" REF="030274_1074_0FE5757F79CBA398">
we pa&s;&s;ed along, received our la&s;t farewels, with every mark of good-will and affection.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>HAVING cleared the land about ten, we &s;tood to the northward, with a view of &s;earching for an harbour, which the natives had often mentioned, on the &s;outh-ea&s;t &s;ide of Mo|wee.
<PB N="245" REF="030274_1075_0FE57587B8586870">
We found our&s;elves, the next morning, driven to leeward, by a &s;well from the north-ea&s;t; and a fre&s;h gale, from the &s;ame quarter, drove us &s;till farther to the we&s;tward. At mid|night we tacked, and &s;tood four hours to the &s;outh, to keep clear of the land; and, at day-break, on the 24th, we were &s;tanding towards a &s;mall barren i&s;land, named Tahoorow, about &s;even miles &s;outh-we&s;t of Mowee.</P>
<P>Giving up all pro&s;pect of making a clo&s;er ex|amination of the &s;outh-ea&s;t parts of Mowee, we bore away, and kept along the &s;outh-ea&s;t &s;ide of Tahoorowa. Steering clo&s;e round its we&s;tern extremity, in order to fetch the we&s;t &s;ide of Mo|wee, we &s;uddenly &s;hoaled our water, and &s;aw the &s;ea breaking on &s;ome rocks, almo&s;t right a-head. We then kept away about a league and a half, and again &s;teered to the northward; when we &s;tood for a pa&s;&s;age between Mowee, and an i&s;land named Ranai. In the afternoon, the weather was calm, with light airs from the we&s;t. We &s;tood to the north-north-we&s;t; but, ob&s;erving a &s;hoal about &s;un&s;et, and the weather being un&s;et|tled, we &s;tood towards the &s;outh.</P>
<P>We had now pa&s;&s;ed the &s;outh-we&s;t &s;ide of this i&s;land, without being able to approach the &s;hore. This &s;ide of the i&s;land forms the &s;ame di&s;tant view as the north-ea&s;t, as &s;een when we returned from the north, in November, 1778; the hilly parts, connected by low flat i&s;thmus, having,
<PB N="246" REF="030274_1076_0FE57589412A1C68">
at the fir&s;t view, the appearance of two &s;eparate i&s;lands. This deceptive appearance continued till we were within about ten leagues of the coa&s;t, which, bending a great way inward, formed a capacious bay. The we&s;ternmo&s;t point off which the &s;hoal runs that we have ju&s;t now mentioned, is rendered remarkable by a &s;mall hillock; &s;outh of which is a fine &s;andy bay; and on the &s;hore, are &s;everal huts, with plenty of cocoa-trees about them.</P>
<P>In the cour&s;e of the day, &s;everal of the na|tives vi&s;ited us, and brought provi&s;ions with them. We pre&s;ently di&s;covered, that they had heard of our unfortunate di&s;a&s;ter at Owhyhee. They were extremely anxious to be informed of the particulars, from a woman who had hid her&s;elf in the Re&s;olution, in order to obtain a pa&s;&s;age to Atooi; making particular enquiries about Pa|reea, and &s;ome other chiefs; and &s;eeming much agitated at the death of Kaneena, and his bro|ther. But, in whatever light this bu&s;ine&s;s might have been repre&s;ented by the woman, it pro|duced no bad effect in their behaviour, which was civil and obliging to an extreme.</P>
<P>During the night, the weather varied continu|ally, but on the 25th, in the morning, the wind being at ea&s;t, we &s;teered along the &s;outh &s;ide of Ranai, till almo&s;t noon, when we had baffling winds and calms till the evening; after which, we had a light ea&s;terly breeze, and &s;teered for the
<PB N="247" REF="030274_1077_0FE575687118B1F0">
we&s;t of Morotoi. The current, which had &s;et from the north-ea&s;t, ever &s;ince we left Karaka|kooa bay, changed its direction, in the cour&s;e of this day, to the &s;outh-ea&s;t.</P>
<P>The wind was again variable during the night; but, early in the morning of the 26th, it &s;ettled at ea&s;t; blowing &s;o fre&s;h, as to oblige us to dou|ble-reef the top-&s;ails. At &s;even, we opened a &s;mall bay, di&s;tant about two leagues, having a fine &s;andy beach; but not perceiving any appear|ance of fre&s;h water, we endeavoured to get to the windward of Woahoo, an i&s;land which we had &s;een in January, 1778. We &s;aw the land about two in the afternoon, bearing we&s;t by north at the di&s;tance of about eight leagues. We tack|ed, as &s;oon as it was dark, and again bore away at day-light on the 27th. Between ten and ele|ven, we were about a league of the &s;hore, and near the middle of the north-ea&s;t &s;ide of the i&s;land.</P>
<P>To the northward, the coa&s;t con&s;i&s;ts of detach|ed hills, a&s;cending perpendicular from the &s;ea; the &s;ides being covered with wood, and the val|lies between them appearing to be fertile, and well cultivated. An exten&s;ive bay was ob&s;erv|able to the &s;outhward, bounded, to the &s;outh-ea&s;t, by a low point of land, covered with cocoa-nut trees; off which, an in&s;ulated rock appeared, at the di&s;tance of a mile from the &s;hore.</P>
<P><PB N="248" REF="030274_1078_0FE5754F59E2C138">The wind continuing to blow fre&s;h, we were unwilling to entangle our&s;elves with a lee-&s;hore. In&s;tead of attempting, therefore, to examine the bay, we hauled up and &s;teered in the direction of the coa&s;t. At noon, we were about two leagues from the i&s;land, and a-brea&s;t of the north point of it. It is low and flat, having a reef &s;tretch|ing off almo&s;t a mile and an half. Between the north point, and a head-land to the &s;outh-we&s;t, the land bends inward, and &s;eemed to promi&s;e a good road. We therefore &s;teered along the &s;hore, at about a mile di&s;tance. At two, we were in|duced, by the &s;ight of a fine river, to anchor in thirteen fathoms water. In the afternoon, Mr. King attended the two Captains on &s;hore, where few of the natives were to be &s;een, and tho&s;e principally women. The men, we were inform|ed, were gone to Morotoi, to fight Tahyterree; but their chief, Perreeorance, remained behind, and would certainly attend us, as &s;oon as he was informed of our arrival.</P>
<P>The water, to our great di&s;appointment, had a bracki&s;h ta&s;te, for about two hundred yards up the river; beyond which, however, it was per|fectly fre&s;h, and was a delightful &s;tream. Far|ther up, we came to the conflux of two &s;mall ri|vulets, branching off to the right and left of a &s;teep romantic mountain. The banks of the river, and all that we &s;aw of Woahoo, are in fine cultivation, and full of villages; the face of the
<PB N="249" REF="030274_1079_0FE57554DEA99FE8">
country being al&s;o remarkably beautiful and pic|ture&s;que.</P>
<P>As it would have been a laborious bu&s;ine&s;s to have watered at this place, Mr. King was di&s;|patched to &s;earch about the coa&s;t to leeward; but, being unable to land, on account of a reef of coral, which extended along the &s;hore, Captain Clerke re&s;olved to proceed immediately to Atooi. In the morning, about eight, we weighed, and &s;tood to the northward; and, on the 28th, at day-light, we bore away for that i&s;land, and were in &s;ight of it by noon. We were off its ea&s;tern extremity, which is a green flat point, about &s;un-&s;et.</P>
<P>It being dark, we did not venture to run for the road on the &s;outh-we&s;t &s;ide, but &s;pent the night in plying on and off, and anchored, at nine the next morning, in twenty-five fathoms water. In running down, from the &s;outh-ea&s;t point of the i&s;land, we &s;aw, in many places, the appearance of &s;hoal water, at &s;ome di&s;tance from the land.</P>
<P>Being anchored in our old &s;tation, &s;everal ca|noes came to vi&s;it us; but it was very ob&s;ervable, that there was not that appearance of cordiality in their manner, and complacency in their coun|tenances, as when we &s;aw them before. They had no &s;ooner got on board, but one of them in|formed us, that we had communicated a di&s;order to the women, which had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">lled many per&s;ons of
<PB N="250" REF="030274_1080_0FE5756A80E8C9C0">
both &s;exes. He, at that time, was afflicted with the venereal di&s;ea&s;e, and minutely de&s;cribed the various &s;ymptoms which had attended it. As no appearance of that di&s;order had been ob&s;erved among&s;t them, on our fir&s;t arrival, we were, it is to be feared, the authors of this irreparable mi&s;chief.</P>
<P>The principal object in view, at this place, was to water the &s;hips with as much expedition as po&s;&s;ible; and Mr. King was &s;ent on &s;hore in the afternoon, with the launch and pinnace, laden with ca&s;ks. He was accompanied by the gun|ner of the Re&s;olution, who was in&s;tructed to trade for &s;ome provi&s;ions; and they were attend|ed by a guard of five marines. Multitudes of people were collected upon the beach, by whom, at fir&s;t, we were kindly received; but, after we had landed the ca&s;ks, they began to be exceed|ingly trouble&s;ome.</P>
<P>Knowing, from experience, how difficult a ta&s;k it was to repre&s;s this di&s;po&s;ition, without the interpo&s;ition of their chiefs, we were &s;orry to be informed, that they were all at a di&s;tant part of the i&s;land. Indeed we both felt and lamented the want of their a&s;&s;i&s;tance; for we could hardly form a circle, as our practice u&s;ually was, for the &s;afety and convenience of the trading party. No &s;ooner had we taken this &s;tep, and po&s;ted marines to keep off the populace, than a man took hold of the bayonet belonging to one of the
<PB N="251" REF="030274_1081_0FE5756F3B106068">
&s;oldier's mu&s;quets, and endeavoured to wrench it forcibly from his hand. Mr. King immedi|ately advanced towards them, when the native quitted his hold, and retired; but immediately returned, having a &s;pear in one hand, and a dag|ger in the other; and it was with difficulty that his countrymen could re&s;train him from engaging with the &s;oldier. This affray was occa&s;ioned by the native's having received, from the &s;oldier, a &s;light prick with his bayonet, to induce him to keep without the line.</P>
<P>Our &s;ituation, at this time, required great management and circum&s;pection; Mr. King ac|cordingly enjoined, that no one &s;hould pre&s;ume to fire, or proceed to any other act of violence, without po&s;itive commands. Having given the&s;e in&s;tructions, he was &s;ummoned to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the watering party, where he found the natives in the &s;ame mi&s;chievous di&s;po&s;ition. They had peremptorily demanded, for every ca&s;k of water, a large hatchet; which not being complied with, they would not permit the &s;ailors to roll them to the boats.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as Mr. King had joined them, one of the natives approached him, with great in&s;o|lence, and made the &s;ame demand. Mr. King told him, that, as a friend, he was welcome to a hatchet, but he certainly would carry off the wa|ter, without paying for it; and in&s;tantly order|ed the pinnace men to proceed; at the &s;ame
<PB N="252" REF="030274_1082_0FE575BE09C37748">
time calling for three marines, from the trading party, to protect them.</P>
<P>This becoming &s;pirit &s;o far &s;ucceeded, as to prevent any daring attempt to interrupt us, but they &s;till per&s;evered in the mo&s;t tea&s;ing and in|&s;ulting behaviour. Some of them, under pre|tence of a&s;&s;i&s;ting the &s;ailors in rolling the ca&s;ks towards the &s;hore, gave them a different direc|tion; others &s;tole the hats from off our people's heads, pulled them backward by the &s;kirts of their clothes, and tripped up their heels; the popu|lace, during all this time, &s;houting and laugh|ing, with a mixture of mockery and malice. They afterwards took an opportunity of &s;tealing the cooper's bucket, and forcibly took away his bag. Their principal aim, however, was to po&s;|&s;e&s;s them&s;elves of the mu&s;quets of the marines, who were continually complaining of their at|tempts to force them from their hands. Though they, in general, pre&s;erved a kind of deference and re&s;pect for Mr. King, yet they obliged him to contribute his &s;hare towards their &s;tock of plunder. One of them approached him, in a familiar manner, and diverted his attention, whil&s;t another &s;eized his hanger, which he held carele&s;sly in his hand, and ran away with it.</P>
<P>Such in&s;olence was not to be repelled by force. Prudence dictated that we mu&s;t patiently &s;ubmit to it; at the &s;ame time, guarding again&s;t its ef|fects as well as we were able. Mr. King was,
<PB N="253" REF="030274_1083_0FE5758B26FEF8A0">
however, &s;omewhat alarmed, on being &s;oon after informed by the &s;erjeant of marines, that, turn|ing &s;uddenly round, he &s;aw a man behind him, armed with a dagger, in the po&s;ition of &s;triking. Though he might, perhaps, be mi&s;taken, in this particular, our &s;ituation was truly critical and alarming; and the &s;malle&s;t error, or mi&s;take, on our part, might have been of fatal con&s;equences.</P>
<P>Our people being &s;eparated into three &s;mall parties; one filling ca&s;ks at the lake; another rolling them to the &s;hore; and a third purcha&s;ing provi&s;ions; Mr. King had &s;ome intentions of collecting them together, in order to protect the performance of one duty at a time. But, on due reflection, he thought it more advi&s;eable to let them proceed as they had begun. If a real at|tack had been made, even our whole force could have made but a poor re&s;i&s;tance. He thought, on the other hand, that &s;uch a &s;tep might operate to our di&s;advantage, as being an evident token of our fears. Be&s;ides, in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e the crowd was kept divided, and many of them wholly occupied in bartering.</P>
<P>The principal cau&s;e of their not attacking us was, perhaps, their dread of the effects of our arms; and, as we appeared to place &s;o much confidence in this advantage, as to oppo&s;e only five marines to &s;uch a multitude of people, their ideas of our &s;uperiority mu&s;t have been greatly exalted. It was our bu&s;ine&s;s to cheri&s;h this opi|nion;
<PB N="254" REF="030274_1084_0FE575B2DC745510">
and, it mu&s;t ever be acknowledged, to the honour of the whole party, that it was impo&s;|&s;ible for any men to behave better, in order to &s;trengthen the&s;e impre&s;&s;ions. Whatever could be con&s;idered as a je&s;t, they received with pa|tience and good-nature; but, if they were inter|rupted by any &s;erious attempt, they oppo&s;ed it with re&s;olute looks and menaces. At length, we &s;o far &s;ucceeded, as to get all our ca&s;ks to the &s;ea-&s;ide, without any accident of con&s;equence.</P>
<P>While our people were getting the ca&s;ks into the launch, the inhabitants thinking they &s;hould have no farther opportunity of plundering, grew more daring and in&s;olent. The &s;erjeant of ma|rines luckily &s;ugge&s;ted to Mr. King, the advan|tage of &s;ending off his party fir&s;t into the boats, by which means the mu&s;quets would be taken out of their reach; which, as above related, were the grand objects the i&s;landers had in view: and, if they &s;hould happen to attack us, the marines could more effectually defend us, than if they were on &s;hore.</P>
<P>Every thing was now in the boats, and only Mr. King, Mr. Ander&s;on, the gunner, and a &s;eaman of the boat's crew, remained on &s;hore. The pinnace laying beyond the &s;urf, which we were under a nece&s;&s;ity of &s;wimming through, Mr. King ordered the other two to make the be&s;t of their way to it, and told them he would follow them.</P>
<P><PB N="255" REF="030274_1085_0FE575CBDAD8ECC0">They both refu&s;ed to comply with this order, and it became a matter of conte&s;t, who &s;hould be the la&s;t on &s;hore. Some ha&s;ty expre&s;&s;ion, it &s;eems Mr. King had ju&s;t before made u&s;e of to the &s;ailor, which he con&s;idered as a reflection on his courage, and excited his re&s;entment; and the old gunner, as a point of honour was now &s;tart|ed, conceived it to be his duty to take a part in it. In this whim&s;ical &s;ituation, they, perhaps, might have long remained, had not the di&s;pute been &s;ettled by the &s;tones, which began to fly plentifully about us, and by the exclamations of the people from the boats, begging us to be expe|ditious, as the natives were armed with clubs and &s;pears, and pur&s;uing us into the water. Mr. King arrived fir&s;t at the pinnace, and, perceiv|ing Mr. Ander&s;on was &s;o far behind, as not to be entirely out of danger, he ordered one mu&s;quet to be fired; but in the hurry of executing his orders, the marines fired two. The natives im|mediately ran away, leaving only one man and woman on the beach. The man attempted to ri&s;e &s;everal times, but was not able, having been wounded in the groin. The i&s;landers, in a &s;hort time, returned; and, &s;urrounding the wounded man, brandi&s;hed their &s;pears at us, with an air of defiance; but, by the time we reached the &s;hips, &s;ome per&s;ons arrived which we &s;uppo&s;ed to be the chiefs, by whom they were all driven from the &s;hore.</P>
<P><PB N="256" REF="030274_1086_0FE575916857B688">Captain Clerke, during our ab&s;ence, had been under terrible apprehen&s;ions for our &s;afety; which had been con&s;iderably increa&s;ed by his mi&s;under|&s;tanding &s;ome of the natives, with whom he had had &s;ome conver&s;ation on board. The name of Captain Cook being frequently mentioned, ac|companied with circum&s;tantial de&s;criptions of death and de&s;truction, he concluded that they had received intelligence of the unfortunate events at Owhyhee, to which they alluded. But they were only endeavouring to make him under&s;tand, that wars had ari&s;en on account of the goats, which Captain Cook had left at Oneeheow, and that the poor goats had been &s;laughtered, during the conte&s;t for the property of them. Captain Clerke, applying the&s;e &s;hocking repre&s;entations to our misfortunes at Owhyhee, and to an indi|cation of revenge, fixed his tele&s;cope upon us the whole time: and, as &s;oon as he &s;aw the &s;moke of the mu&s;quets, ordered the boats to be put off to our a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>On the 2d of March, being the next day, Mr. King was again ordered on &s;hore, with the wa|tering party. Ae we had &s;o narrowly e&s;caped the preceding day, Captain Clerke augmented our force from both &s;hips, and we had a guard of forty men under arms. This precaution, how|ver, was found to be unnece&s;&s;ary; for the beach was left entirely to our&s;elves, and the ground, extending from the landing-place to the lake, <HI>ta|booed.</HI>
<PB N="257" REF="030274_1087_0FE57585B31DAD98">
Hence we concluded, that &s;ome of the chiefs had vi&s;ited this quarter; who, being un|able to &s;tay, had con&s;iderately taken this &s;tep, that we might be accommodated with &s;afety. Se|veral men appeared with &s;pears and daggers, on the other &s;ide of the river, but never attempted to mole&s;t us. Their women came over, and &s;eat|ed them&s;elves clo&s;e by us, on the banks; and about the middle of the day, &s;ome of the men were prevailed on to bring us hogs and roots, and al&s;o to dre&s;s them for us. When we had left the beach, they came down to the &s;ea-&s;ide, and one of them had the audacity to throw a &s;tone at us; but, as his conduct was highly cen&s;ured by the re&s;t, we did not expre&s;s any kind of re&s;ent|ment.</P>
<P>On the 3d, we completed our watering, with|out much difficulty; and, on returning to the &s;hips, we were informed, that &s;everal chiefs had been on board, and had apologized for the con|duct of their countrymen, attributing their riot|ous behaviour to the quarrels then &s;ub&s;i&s;ting among the principal people of the i&s;land, and which had de&s;troyed all order and &s;ubordination.</P>
<P>The government of Atooi was di&s;puted be|tween Toneoneo, who had the &s;upreme power when we were there the preceding year, and a youth named Teavee. By different fathers, they are both the grand&s;ons of Perreeorannee, king of Woahoo; who gave Atooi to the former, and
<PB N="258" REF="030274_1088_0FE575BF901318D8">
Oneeheow to the latter. The quarrel originated about the goats which we had left at Oneeheow the year before; they being claimed by Toneo|neo, as that i&s;land was a dependency of his. The adherents of Teavee in&s;i&s;ting on the right of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, both parties prepared to &s;upport their preten&s;ions, and a battle en&s;ued ju&s;t before our arrival, wherein Toneoneo had been defeated. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">neoneo was likely to become more affected by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> con&s;equence of this victory, than by the lo&s;s of the objects in di&s;pute; for the mother of Tea|vee having married a &s;econd hu&s;band, who was not only a chief at Atooi, but al&s;o at the head of a powerful faction there, he thought of embracing the pre&s;ent opportunity of driving Toneoneo out of the i&s;land, that his &s;on-in-law might &s;ucceed to the government. The goats, which had in|crea&s;ed to &s;ix, and would probably have &s;tocked the&s;e i&s;lands in a few years, were de&s;troyed in this conte&s;t.</P>
<P>On the 4th we were vi&s;ited, on board the Re|&s;olution, by the father-in-law, the mother, and the &s;i&s;ter of the young prince, who made &s;everal curious pre&s;ents to Captain Clerke. Among the re&s;t, were &s;ome fi&s;h-hooks, which were made from the bones of Terreeoboo's father, who had been killed in an un&s;ucce&s;sful de&s;cent upon Woa|hoo. Al&s;o a fly-flap, from the hands of the prince's &s;i&s;ter, which had a human bone for its handle, and had been given to her by her father-in-law,

as a trophy. They were not accompa|nied by young Teavee, he being then engaged in the performance of &s;ome religious rites, on ac|count of the victory he had obtained.</P>
<P>This day, and the 5th and 6th, were employed in completing the Di&s;covery's water. The car|penters were engaged in caulking the &s;hips, and preparing for our next crui&s;e. We no longer re|ceived any mole&s;tation from the natives, who &s;upplied us plentifully with pork and vegetables.</P>
<P>We were now vi&s;ited by an Indian, who brought a piece of iron on board, to be formed into the &s;hape of a <HI>pahooa.</HI> It was the bolt of &s;ome large &s;hip timbers, but neither the officers nor men could di&s;cover to what nation it belonged; though, from the &s;hape of the bolt, and the palene&s;s of the iron, they were convinced it was not Eng|li&s;h. They enquired &s;trictly of the native how he came po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of it, when he informed them, that it was taken out of a large piece of timber, which had been driven upon their i&s;land, &s;ince we were there in January, 1778.</P>
<P>We received a vi&s;it, on the 7th, from Tone|oneo, at which we were &s;urprized. Hearing the dowager prince&s;s was on board, he could hardly be prevailed on to enter the &s;hip. When they met, they ca&s;t an angry lowering look at each other. He did not &s;tay long, and appeared much dejected. We remarked, however, with &s;ome degree of &s;urprize, that the women pro&s;trated

them&s;elves before him, both at his coming and going away; and all the natives on board, treat|ed him with that re&s;pect which is u&s;ually paid to per&s;ons of his rank. It was &s;omewhat remark|able, that a man, who was then in a &s;tate of ac|tual ho&s;tility with Teavee's party, &s;hould venture alone within the power of his enemies. Indeed the civil di&s;&s;en&s;ions, which are frequent in all the &s;outh &s;ea i&s;lands, &s;eem to be conducted with|out much acrimony; the depo&s;ed Governor &s;till enjoying the rank of an <HI>Eree,</HI> and may put in practice &s;uch means as may ari&s;e; to regain the con&s;equence which he has lo&s;t.</P>
<P>At nine, in the morning of the 8th, we weigh|ed, and proceeded towards Oneeheow, and came to anchor in twenty fathoms water, at about three in the afternoon, nearly on the &s;pot where we an|chored in 1778. With the other anchor, we moored in twenty-&s;ix fathoms water. We had a &s;trong gale from the ea&s;tward in the night, and, the next morning, the &s;hip had driven a whole cable's length, both anchors being almo&s;t brought a-head; in which &s;ituation we were obliged to continue, this and the two following days.</P>
<P>The weather being more moderate on the 12th, the Ma&s;ter was di&s;patched to the north-we&s;t &s;ide of the i&s;land, in &s;earch of a more commodious place for anchoring. In the evening, he return|ed, having found a fine bay, with good anchor|age, in eighteen fathoms water. The points of

the bay were in the direction of north by ea&s;t, and &s;outh by we&s;t. A &s;mall village was &s;ituated on the north &s;ide of the bay, to the ea&s;tward of which were four wells of good water. Mr. Bligh went far enough to the north to convince him|&s;elf that Oreehoua, and Oneeheow, were too &s;e|parate i&s;lands.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>BEING now on the point of taking our final leave of the Sandwich I&s;lands, we &s;hall here give a general account of their &s;ituation and
<PB N="262" REF="030274_1092_0FE5756001AAF8B0">
natural hi&s;tory, as well as of the cu&s;toms and manners of the natives. This will &s;erve as a kind of &s;upplement to the former de&s;cription, which was the re&s;ult of our fir&s;t vi&s;it to the&s;e i&s;lands.</P>
<P>This group is compo&s;ed of eleven I&s;lands, ex|tending in longitude from 190&deg; 36&prime; to 205&deg; 6&prime;, ea&s;t, and in latitude from 18&deg; 54&prime;, to 22&deg; 15&prime; north. Their names, according to the natives, are, 1. Owhyhee. 2. Atooi, Atowi, or Towi; which is al&s;o &s;ome times called Kowi. 3. Woa|hoo, or Oahoo. 4. Mowee. 5. Morotoi, or Morokoi. 6. Oreehoua, or Reehoua. 7. Mo|rotinnee, or Morokinnee. 8. Tahoora. 9. Ra|nai, or Oranai. 10. Oneeheow, or Neeheehow. 11. Kahowrowee, or Tahoorowa. The&s;e are all inhabited except Tahoora and Morotinnee. Be|&s;ides tho&s;e we have enumerated, we heard of another i&s;land named Modoo-papapa, or Komo|doo-papapa, &s;ituated to the we&s;t-&s;outh-we&s;t of Tahoora: it is low and &s;andy, and is vi&s;ited &s;olely for the purpo&s;e of catching turtle and wa|ter-fowl. As we could never learn that the na|tives had knowledge of any other i&s;lands, it is mo&s;t probable that no others exi&s;t in their neigh|bourhood.</P>
<P>Captain Cook had di&s;tingui&s;hed this clu&s;ter of i&s;lands by the name of the Sandwich I&s;lands, in honour of the Earl of Sandwich, then fir&s;t Lord of the Admiralty, under who&s;e admini&s;tration he
<PB N="263" REF="030274_1093_0FE575EBEC065708">
had enriched Geography with &s;o many valuable di&s;coveries; a tribute ju&s;tly due to that noble|man, for the encouragement and &s;upport which the&s;e voyages derive from his power, and for the zealous eagerne&s;s with which he &s;econded the views of our illu&s;trious navigator.</P>
<P>Owhyhee, the mo&s;t ea&s;terly of the&s;e i&s;lands, and by far the large&s;t of them all, is of a trian|gular figure, and nearly equilaterial. The an|gular points con&s;titute the northern, &s;outhern, and ea&s;tern extremities. The latitude of the northern extreme is 20&deg; 17&prime; north, and its longi|tude 204&deg; 2&prime; ea&s;t: the &s;outhern end &s;tands in the longitude of 204&deg; 15&prime; ea&s;t, and in the latitude of 18&deg; 54&prime; north; and the ea&s;tern extremity is in the latitude of 19&deg; 34&prime; north, and in the lon|gitude of 205&deg; 6&prime; ea&s;t. The circumference of the whole i&s;land is about 255 geographical miles, or 293 Engli&s;h ones. Its breadth is twenty-four leagues; and its greate&s;t length, which lies near|ly in a north and &s;outh direction, is twenty-eight leagues and a half. It is divided into &s;ix ex|ten&s;ive di&s;tricts, namely, Akona and Koaara, which are on the we&s;t &s;ide; Kaoo and Opoona, on the &s;outh-ea&s;t; and Aheedoo and Amakooa, on the north-ea&s;t.</P>
<P>A mountain named <HI>Mouna Kaah,</HI> (or the moun|tain Kaah) which ri&s;es in three peaks, continu|ally covered with &s;now, and may be di&s;cerned at the di&s;tance of forty leagues, &s;eparates the di&s;|trict
<PB N="264" REF="030274_1094_0FE5755C98BA7D78">
of Amakooa from that of Aheedoo. The coa&s;t, to the northward of this mountain, is compo&s;ed of high and abrupt cliffs, down which fall many beautiful ca&s;cades of water. We once flattered our&s;elves with the hopes of finding a harbour round a bluff head, on a part of this coa&s;t, in the latitude of 20&deg; 10&prime; north, and the longitude of 204&deg; 26&prime; ea&s;t; but after we had doubled the point, and were &s;tanding clo&s;e in, we found that it was connected, by a low valley, with another elevated head to the north-we&s;tward. The country ri&s;es inland with a gradual a&s;cent, and is inter&s;ected by narrow deep glens, or rather cha&s;ms; it &s;eemed to be well cultivated, and to have many villages &s;cattered about it. The &s;nowy mountain above-mentioned is very &s;teep, and its lowe&s;t part abounds with wood.</P>
<P>The coa&s;t of Aoeedoo is of a moderate eleva|tion; and the interior parts have the appearance of being more even than the country towards the north-we&s;t. We crui&s;ed off the&s;e two di&s;tricts for near a month; and, whenever our di&s;tance from the &s;hore would permit, were &s;urrounded by canoes laden with refre&s;hments of every kind. On this &s;ide of the i&s;land we often met with a very heavy &s;ea, and a great &s;well; and, as there was much foul ground off the &s;hore, we &s;eldom made a nearer approach to the land than two or three leagues.</P>
<P><PB N="265" REF="030274_1095_0FE57574DB522BD0">The coa&s;t towards the north-ea&s;t of Apoona, which con&s;titutes the ea&s;tern extreme of the i&s;land, is rather low and flat. In the inland parts the acclivity is very gradual; and the country abounds with bread-fruit and cocoa-nut trees. This ap|peared to us to be the fine&s;t part of the whole i&s;land; and we were afterwards informed, that the king occa&s;ionally re&s;ided here. The hills, at the &s;outh-we&s;tern extremity, ri&s;e with &s;ome abrupt|ne&s;s from the &s;ea-&s;ide, leaving only a narrow border of low land towards the beach. The &s;ides of the&s;e hills were covered with verdure; but the adjacent country &s;eemed thinly inhabited.</P>
<P>When our &s;hips doubled the ea&s;t point of the i&s;land, we had &s;ight of another &s;nowy mountain, called by the natives <HI>Mouna Roa</HI> (or the exten&s;ive mountain) which, during the whole time we were &s;ailing along the &s;outh-ea&s;tern &s;ide, conti|nued to be a very con&s;picuous object. It was flat at the &s;ummit, which was perpetually involved in &s;now; and we once ob&s;erved its &s;ides al&s;o &s;lightly covered with it for a con&s;iderable way down. According to the tropical line of &s;now, as determined by Mon&s;ieur Condamine, from ob|&s;ervations made on the Cordilleras in America, the height of this mountain mu&s;t be, at lea&s;t, 16,020 feet. It therefore exceeds the height of the <HI>Pico de Teyde,</HI> or Peak of Teneriffe, by 3680 feet, according to the computation of the Che|valier de Borda, or 724, according to that of
<PB N="266" REF="030274_1096_0FE5755E1F31BBA8">
Dr. Heberden. The peaks of Mouna Kaah &s;eemed to be of the heigh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of about half a mile; and, as they are wholly covered with &s;now, the altitude of their &s;ummits mu&s;t at lea&s;t be 18,400 feet.</P>
<P>The coa&s;t of Kaoo exhibits a mo&s;t horrid and di&s;mal pro&s;pect; the whole country having, to appearance, undergone an entire change from the con&s;equences of &s;ome dreadful convul&s;ion. The ground is, in all parts, covered with cinders; and, in many places, inter&s;ected with blacki&s;h &s;treaks, which &s;eem to mark the progre&s;s of a <HI>lava</HI> that has flowed, not many centuries ago, from Mouna Roa to the &s;hore. The &s;outh pro|montory appears like the mere dregs of a volcano. The head-land con&s;i&s;ts of broken and craggy rocks, terminating in acute points, and irregu|larly piled on each other. Notwith&s;tanding the dreary a&s;pect of this part of the i&s;land, it con|tains many villages, and is far more populous than the verdant mountains of Apoona. Nor is it difficult to account for this circum&s;tance. The&s;e i&s;landers not being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of any cattle, have no occa&s;ion for pa&s;turage; and are therefore in|clined to prefer &s;uch ground, as is either more conveniently &s;ituated for fi&s;hing, or be&s;t adapted to the cultivation of plantains and yams. Now amid&s;t the&s;e ruins, there are many &s;pots of rich &s;oil, which are, with great care, laid out in plan|tations;
<PB N="267" REF="030274_1097_0FE575FBD4C62938">
and the neighbouring &s;ea abounds with excellent fi&s;h of various kinds.</P>
<P>Off this part of the coa&s;t, at le&s;s than a cable's length from the &s;hore, we did not &s;trike ground with one hundred and &s;ixty fathoms of line, ex|cept in a &s;mall bight to the ea&s;t of the &s;outhern point, where we found from fifty to fifty-eight fathoms of water, over a &s;andy bottom. It may be proper to ob&s;erve, before we proceed to give an account of the we&s;tern di&s;tricts, that the whole coa&s;t we have de&s;cribed from the northern to the &s;outhern extreme, affords not a &s;ingle harbour, nor the lea&s;t &s;helter for &s;hipping.</P>
<P>The &s;outh-we&s;tern parts of Akona are in a condition &s;imilar to that of the adjoining di&s;trict of Kaoo; but the country, further towards the north, has been carefully cultivated, and is ex|ceedingly populous. In this divi&s;ion of the i&s;land, lies Karakakooa Bay, of which we have already given a de&s;cription. Scarce any thing is &s;een along the coa&s;t, but the fragments of black &s;corch|ed rocks; behind which, the ground, for the &s;pace of about two miles and a half, ri&s;es gra|dually, and &s;eems to have been once covered with loo&s;e burnt &s;tones. The&s;e have been cleared away by the inhabitants, frequently to the depth of three feet and upwards; and the fertility of the &s;oil has amply repaired their labour. Here they cultivate in a rich a&s;hy mould, the cloth-plant and &s;weet potatoes. Groves of cocoa-nut-trees
<PB N="268" REF="030274_1098_0FE575655B2BBBF8">
are &s;cattered among the fields, which are inclo&s;ed with &s;tone fences. On the ri&s;ing ground beyond the&s;e, they plant bread-fruit trees, which flouri&s;h with &s;urpri&s;ing luxuriance.</P>
<P>The di&s;trict of Koaarra extends from the mo&s;t we&s;terly point to the northern extreme of the i&s;land. The whole coa&s;t between them forms a &s;pacious bay, which is called by the natives Toe-yah-yah, and is bounded to the northward by two con&s;picuous hills. Towards the bottom of this bay there is foul corally ground, that extends to the di&s;tance of upwards of a mile fron the &s;hore, without which there is good anchorage. The country, as far as the eye could di&s;cern, appeared to be fruitful and populous; but no fre&s;h water was to be found. The &s;oil &s;eemed to be of the &s;ame kind with that of the di&s;trict of Kaoo.</P>
<P>Having thus given an account of the coa&s;ts of the I&s;land of Owhyhee, and the adjacent country, we &s;hall now relate &s;ome particulars re&s;pecting the interior parts, from the information we ob|tained from a party, who &s;et out on the 26th of January, on an expedition up the country, prin|cipally with an intention of reaching the &s;nowy mountains. Having previou&s;ly procured two of the i&s;landers to &s;erve them as guides, they quit|ted the village about four o'clock in the after|noon. Their cour&s;e was ea&s;terly, inclining a lit|tle to the &s;outh. Within three or four miles from the bay, they found the country as already de|&s;cribed;
<PB N="269" REF="030274_1099_0FE575ED71C1ABC0">
but the hills afterwards ro&s;e with a le&s;s gradual a&s;cent, which brought them to &s;ome ex|ten&s;ive plantations, con&s;i&s;ting of the <HI>taro</HI> or eddy root, and &s;weet potatoes, with plants of the cloth-tree. Both the <HI>taro</HI> and the &s;weet potatoes are here planted at the di&s;tance of four feet from each other. The potatoes are earthed up almo&s;t to the top of the &s;talk, with a proper quantity of light mould. The <HI>taro</HI> is left bare to the root, and the mould round it is put in the form of a ba&s;on, for the purpo&s;e of holding the rain-water; this root requiring a certain degree of moi&s;ture. At the Friendly and Society I&s;les, the <HI>taro</HI> was con|&s;tantly planted in low and moi&s;t &s;ituations, and generally in tho&s;e places where there was the con|veniency of a rivulet to flood it. This mode of culture was con&s;idered as ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary; but we now found that this root, with the pre|caution before-mentioned, &s;ucceeds equally well in a more dry &s;ituation. It was indeed, remarked by all of us, that the <HI>taro</HI> of the Sandwich I&s;lands was the be&s;t we had ever ta&s;ted.</P>
<P>The walls, by which the&s;e plantations are &s;eparated from each other, are compo&s;ed of the loo&s;e burnt &s;tones, which are met with in clear|ing the ground; and, being totally concealed by &s;ugar-canes, that are planted clo&s;e on each &s;ide, form the mo&s;t beautiful fences that can be imagined.</P>
<P><PB N="270" REF="030274_1100_0FE5764E395AD0C8">Our party &s;topped for the night at the &s;econd hut they ob&s;erved among the plantations, where they &s;uppo&s;ed them&s;elves to be &s;ix or &s;even miles di&s;tant from our &s;hips. The pro&s;pect from this &s;pot was de&s;cribed by th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">m as very delightful: they had a view of our ve&s;&s;els in the bay before them; to the left they &s;aw a continued range of villages, inter&s;per&s;ed with groves of cocoa-nut-trees, &s;preading along the &s;hore; a thick wood extending it&s;elf behind them; and, to the right, a very con&s;iderable extent of ground, laid out with great regularity in well-cultivated planta|tions, di&s;played it&s;elf to their view. Near this &s;pot the natives pointed out to them, at a di&s;tance from every other dwelling, the re&s;idence of a hermit, who, they &s;aid, had, in the former part of his life, been a great chief and warrior, but had long ago retired from the &s;ea-coa&s;t of the i&s;land, and now never quitted the environs of his cottage. As they approached him, they pro&s;trat|ed them&s;elves, and afterwards pre&s;ented him with &s;ome provi&s;ions. His behaviour was ea&s;y, frank and cheerful. He te&s;tified little a&s;toni&s;h|ment at the &s;ight of our people, and though pre&s;&s;ed to accept of &s;ome European curio&s;ities, he thought proper to decline the offer, and &s;oon withdrew to his cottage. Our party repre&s;ented him as the mo&s;t aged per&s;on they had ever &s;een, judging him to be, at a moderate computation, upwards of a hundred years of age.</P>
<P><PB N="271" REF="030274_1101_0FE576E72E5E02A8">As our people had &s;uppo&s;ed that the mountain was not more than ten or a dozen miles di&s;tant from the bay, and con&s;equently expected to reach it with ea&s;e early the following morning, they were now greatly &s;urpri&s;ed to find the di&s;tance &s;carce perceivably dimini&s;hed. This circum|&s;tance, with the uninhabited &s;tate of the country, which they were on the point of entering, render|ing it nece&s;&s;ary to provide a &s;upply of provi&s;ions, they di&s;patched one of their conductors back to the village for that purpo&s;e. Whil&s;t they waited his return, they were joined by &s;everal of Kaoo's &s;ervants, whom that generous old man had &s;ent after them, loaded with refre&s;hments, and fully authorized, as their route lay through his grounds, to demand, and take away with them whatever they might want.</P>
<P>Great was the &s;urpri&s;e of our travellers, on finding the cold here &s;o inten&s;e. But, as they had no thermometer with them, they could only form their judgment of it from their feelings; which, from the warm atmo&s;phere they had quit|ted mu&s;t have been a very fallacious method of judging. They found it, however, &s;o cold, that they could &s;carce get any &s;leep, and the i&s;landers could not &s;leep at all; both parties being di&s;|turbed during the whole night, by continual coughing, As they, at this time, could not be at any very great height, their di&s;tance from the &s;ea being no more than &s;ix or &s;even miles, and
<PB N="272" REF="030274_1102_0FE5764FD1F51778">
part of the road on a very moderate a&s;cent, this uncommon degree of cold mu&s;t be attributed to the ea&s;terly wind blowing fre&s;h over the &s;nowy mountains.</P>
<P>They proceeded on their journey early the next morning, and filled their caliba&s;hes at a well of excellent water, &s;ituate about half a mile from their hut. After they had pa&s;&s;ed the plantations, they arrived at a thick wood which they entered by a path that had been made for the convenience of the i&s;landers, who frequently repair thither for the purpo&s;e of catching birds, as well as procur|ing the wild or hor&s;e-plantain. Their progre&s;s now became extremely &s;low, and was attended with great labour; for the ground was either &s;wampy, or covered with large &s;tones; the path narrow, and often interrupted by trees lying a|cro&s;s it, which they were obliged to climb over as the thickne&s;s of the underwood, on each &s;ide, rendered it impracticable to pa&s;s round them. They &s;aw, in the&s;e woods, pieces of white cloth fixed on poles, at &s;mall di&s;tances, which they imagined were land-marks for the divi&s;ion of pro|perty, as they only ob&s;erved them where the wild plantains grew. The trees were of the &s;ame kind with the &s;pice-tree of New Holland; they were &s;traight and lofty, and their circumference was from two to four feet.</P>
<P>Our party having advanced nine or ten miles in the wood, had the mortification of finding
<PB N="273" REF="030274_1103_0FE576C72AA08960">
them&s;elves, &s;uddenly, within &s;ight of the &s;ea, and not very far from it; the path having turned off imperceptibly to the &s;outh, and carried them to the right of the mountain, which it was their intention to reach. Their di&s;appointment was con&s;iderably heightened by the uncertainty under which they now were with re&s;pect to its true bear|ings, as they could not, at pre&s;ent, gain a view of it from the top of the highe&s;t trees. They, therefore, thought proper to walk back &s;ix or &s;even miles to an unoccupied hut, where they had left two of their own people, and three of the natives, with the &s;mall remnant of their provi|&s;ions. Here they pa&s;&s;ed the &s;econd night, during which the air was &s;o extremely &s;harp, that, by the morning, their guides were all gone off except one.</P>
<P>Being now in want of provi&s;ions, which laid them under the nece&s;&s;ity of returning to &s;ome of the cultivated parts of the i&s;land, they left the wood by the &s;ame path by which they had enter|ed it. When they arrived at the plantations, they were &s;urrounded by the i&s;landers, from whom they purcha&s;ed a fre&s;h &s;upply of nece&s;&s;aries; and prevailed upon two of them to accompany them as guides, in the room of tho&s;e who had gone away. Having procured the be&s;t information they could po&s;&s;ibly obtain, with regard to the direction of their road, the party, who were now nine in number, marched for about half a dozen miles
<PB N="274" REF="030274_1104_0FE576590B81BD60">
along the &s;kirts of the wood, and then entered it again by a path leading towards the ea&s;t. They pa&s;&s;ed, for the fir&s;t three miles, through a fore&s;t of lofty &s;pice-trees, which grew on a rich loam. At the back of the&s;e trees they met with an equal extent of low &s;hrubby trees, together with a con|&s;iderable quantity of thick under-wood, upon a bottom of loo&s;e burnt &s;tones. This led them to another fore&s;t of &s;pice-trees, and the &s;ame rich browni&s;h &s;oil, which was again &s;ucceeded by a barren ridge of a &s;imilar kind with the former. The&s;e ridges, as far as they could be &s;een, ap|peared to run parallel with the &s;ea-&s;hore, and to have Mouna Roa for their centre.</P>
<P>As they pa&s;&s;ed through the woods they found many unfini&s;hed canoes, and huts in &s;everal places; but they &s;aw none of the inhabitants. After they had penetrated almo&s;t three miles into the &s;econd wood, they arrived at two, huts, where they &s;topped, being greatly fatigued with the days journey, in the cour&s;e of which they had walked, according to their own computation, at lea&s;t twenty miles. Having found no &s;prings from the time they quitted the plantations, they had greatly &s;uffered from the violence of their thir&s;t; in con&s;equence of which they were obliged, before the evening came on, to &s;eparate into &s;mall parties, and go in que&s;t of water. They, at la&s;t, met with &s;ome that had been left by rain in the bottom of a half-fini&s;hed canoe; which,
<PB N="275" REF="030274_1105_0FE57641CC5E0BD0">
though of a reddi&s;h colour, was by no means un|welcome to them.</P>
<P>During the night, the cold was more inten&s;e than before; and though they had taken care to wrap them&s;elves up in mats and cloths of the country, and to keep a large fire between the two huts, they could get but very little &s;leep, and were under the nece&s;&s;ity of walking about for the greate&s;t part of the night. Their elevation was now, in all probability, pretty con&s;iderable, as the ground, over which their journey lay, had been generally on the a&s;cent.</P>
<P>The next morning, which was the 29th, they &s;et out early, with an intention of making their la&s;t and greate&s;t effort to reach the &s;nowy moun|tain; but their &s;pirits were con&s;iderably depre&s;|&s;ed, on finding that the mi&s;erable pittance of wa|ter, which they had di&s;covered the preceding night, was expended. The path, which reached no farther than where canoes had been built, be|ing now terminated, they were obliged to make their way as well as they could; frequently climb|ing up the mo&s;t lofty trees, to explore the &s;urrounding country. They arrived, about ele|ven o'clock, at a ridge of burnt &s;tones, from the top of which they had a pro&s;pect of the Mouna Roa, which then appeared to be at a di&s;tance of between twelve and fourteen miles from them.</P>
<P>They now entered into a con&s;ultation, whe|ther they &s;hould proceed any further, or re&s;t
<PB N="276" REF="030274_1106_0FE5766037ACA3C8">
contented with the view they now had of the &s;nowy mountain. Since the path had cea&s;ed, their road had become highly fatiguing, and was growing &s;till more &s;o, every &s;tep they advanced. The ground was almo&s;t every where broken into deep fi&s;&s;ures, which, being &s;lightly covered with mo&s;s, made them &s;tumble almo&s;t continually; and the intervening &s;pace con&s;i&s;ted of a &s;urface of loo&s;e burnt &s;tones, which broke under their feet. Into &s;ome of the&s;e fi&s;&s;ures they threw &s;tones, which &s;eemed from the noi&s;e they made, to fall to a con&s;iderable depth; and the ground &s;ounded hollow as they walked upon it. Be&s;ides the&s;e cir|cum&s;tances, which di&s;couraged them from pro|ceeding, they found their conductors &s;o aver&s;e to going on, that they had rea&s;on to think they would not be prevailed on to remain out another night. They, therefore, at length came to a de|termination of returning to the &s;hips, after tak|ing a &s;urvey of the country from the highe&s;t trees they could find. From this elevation, they per|ceived them&s;elves &s;urrounded with wood towards the &s;ea; they were unable to di&s;tingui&s;h, in the horizon, the &s;ky from the water; and betwixt them and the &s;nowy mountain, was a valley of about eight miles in breadth.</P>
<P>The travellers pa&s;&s;ed this night at a hut in the &s;econd fore&s;t; and the following day before noon, they had pa&s;&s;ed the fir&s;t wood, and found them|&s;elves nine or ten miles to the north-ea&s;t of the
<PB N="277" REF="030274_1107_0FE5764ADF27E420">
&s;hips, towards which they marched through the plantations. As they walked along, they did not ob&s;erve a &s;pot of ground, that was &s;u&s;cep|tible of improvement, left unplanted; and, in|deed, the country, from their account, could &s;carcely be cultivated to greater advantage for the purpo&s;es of the natives.</P>
<P>They were &s;urpri&s;ed at &s;eeing &s;everal fields of hay; and upon their enquiry, to what particu|lar u&s;e it was applied, they were informed, that it was intended to cover the ground where the young <HI>taro</HI> grew, in order to pre&s;erve them from being &s;corched by the rays of the &s;un. They ob|&s;erved among the plantations, a few huts &s;cat|tered about, which afforded occa&s;ional &s;helter to the labourers: but they did not &s;ee any villages at a greater di&s;tance from the &s;ea than four or five miles. Near one of them, which was &s;itu|ated about four miles from the bay, they di&s;co|vered a cave, forty fathoms in length, three in breadth, and of the &s;ame height. It was open at each end; its &s;ides were fluted, as if wrought with a chi&s;&s;el; and the &s;urface was glazed over, perhaps by the action of fire.</P>
<P>Having thus related the principal circum&s;tances that occurred in the expedition to the &s;nowy mountain at Owhyhee, we &s;hall now proceed to de&s;cribe the other i&s;lands of this groupe.</P>
<P>That which is next in &s;ize, and neare&s;t in &s;itu|ation to Owhyhee, is Mowee. It &s;tands at the
<PB N="278" REF="030274_1108_0FE576640A3864E0">
di&s;tance of eight leagues north-north-we&s;t from Owhyhee, and is one hundred and forty geogra|phical miles in circuit. It is divided by a low i&s;thmus into two circular penin&s;ulas, of which that to the ea&s;tward is named Whamadooa, and is twice as large as that to the we&s;t, called O|whyrookoo. The mountains in both ri&s;e to a very great height, as we were able to &s;ee them at the di&s;tance of above thirty leagues. The northern &s;hores, like tho&s;e of the i&s;le of Owhy|hee, afford no &s;oundings; and the country bears the &s;ame a&s;pect of fertility and verdure. The ea&s;t point of Mowee is in the latitude of 20&deg; 50&prime; north, and in the longitude of 204&deg; 4&prime; ea&s;t.</P>
<P>To the &s;outhward, between Mowee and the adjacent i&s;lands, we found regular depths with one hundred and fifty fathoms over a bottom of &s;and. From the we&s;tern point, which is rather low, runs a &s;hoal, extending towards the i&s;land of Ranai, to a con&s;iderable di&s;tance; and to the &s;outh of this, is an exten&s;ive bay, with a &s;andy beach, &s;haded with cocoa-trees. It is not impro|bable, that good anchorage might be met with here, with &s;helter from the prevailing winds; and that the beach affords a commodious land|ing-place. The country further back is very ro|mantic in its appearance. The hills ri&s;e almo&s;t perpendicularly, exhibiting a variety of peaked forms; and their &s;teep &s;ides, as well as the deep cha&s;ms between them, are covered with trees,
<PB N="279" REF="030274_1109_0FE57661C0E2E208">
among which tho&s;e of the bread-fruit principally abound. The &s;ummits of the&s;e hills are perfectly bare, and of a reddi&s;h brown hue. The natives informed us, that there was a harbour to the &s;outh of the ea&s;tern point, which they a&s;&s;erted was &s;u|perior to that of Karakakooa; and we al&s;o heard that there was another harbour, named Keepoo-keepoo, on the north-we&s;tern &s;ide.</P>
<P>Ranai is about nine miles di&s;tant from Mowee and Morotoi, and is &s;ituate to the &s;outh-we&s;t of the pa&s;&s;age between tho&s;e two i&s;les. The coun|try, towards the &s;outh, is elevated and craggy; but the other parts of the i&s;land had a better ap|pearance, and &s;eemed to be well inhabited. It abounds in roots, &s;uch as &s;weet potatoes, <HI>taro,</HI> and yams; but produces very few plantains and bread fruit-trees. The &s;outh point of Ranai is in the latitude of 20&deg; 46&prime; north, and in the longi|tude of 203&deg; 8&prime; ea&s;t.</P>
<P>Morotoi lies at the di&s;tance of two leagues and a half to the we&s;t-north-we&s;t of Mowee. Its &s;outh-we&s;tern coa&s;t, which was the only part of it we approached, is very low; but the land be|hind ri&s;es to a con&s;iderable elevation; and, at the di&s;tance from which we had a view of it, ap|peared to be de&s;titute of wood. Yams are its principal produce; and it may probably contain fre&s;h water. The coa&s;t, on the &s;outhern and we&s;tern &s;ides of the i&s;land, forms &s;everal bays that promi&s;e a tolerable &s;helter from the trade
<PB N="280" REF="030274_1110_0FE5766B0FE98838">
winds. The we&s;t point of Morotoi is in the lon|gitude of 202&deg; 46&prime; ea&s;t, and in the latitude of 21&deg; 10&prime; north.</P>
<P>Tahoorowa is a &s;mall i&s;land &s;ituated off the &s;outh-we&s;tern part of Mowee, from which it is nine miles di&s;tant. It is de&s;titute of wood, and its &s;oil &s;eems to be &s;andy and unfertile. Its lati|tude is 20&deg; 38&prime; north, and its longitude 203&deg; 27&prime; ea&s;t. Between it and Mowee &s;tands the little i&s;land of Morrotinnee, which has no inhabitants.</P>
<P>Woahoo lies about &s;even leagues to the north-we&s;t of Morotoi. As far as we were enabled to judge, from the appearance of the north-we&s;tern and north-ea&s;tern parts (for we had not an oppor|tunity of &s;eeing the &s;outhern &s;ide) it is by far the fine&s;t of all the Sandwich I&s;lands. The verdure of the hills, the variety of wood and lawn, and fertile well-cultivated vallies, which the whole face of the country pre&s;ented to view, could not be exceeded. Having already de&s;cribed the bay in which we anchored, formed by the northern and we&s;tern extremes, it remains for us to ob&s;erve, that, in the bight of the bay, to the &s;outhward of our anchoring-place, we met with foul rocky ground, about two miles from the &s;hore. If the ground <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ackling of a &s;hip &s;hould happen to be weak, and the wind blow with violence from the north, to which quarter the road is entirely open, this circum&s;tance might be attended with &s;ome degree of danger: but, provided the cables were
<PB N="281" REF="030274_1111_0FE5768746716618">
good, there would be no great hazard, as the ground from the anchoring-place, which is op|po&s;ite the valley through which the river runs, to the northern point, con&s;i&s;ts of a fine &s;and. The latitude of our anchoring-place is 21&deg; 43&prime; north, and the longitude 202&deg; 9&prime; ea&s;t.</P>
<P>Atooi is about twenty-five leagues to the north-we&s;t of Woahoo. Towards the north-ea&s;t and north-we&s;t, the face of the country is ragged and broken; but, to the &s;outhward, it is more even; the hills ri&s;e from the &s;ea-&s;ide with a gentle ac|clivity, and, at a little di&s;tance back, are cover|ed with wood. Its produce is the &s;ame with that of the other i&s;lands of this clu&s;ter; but its inha|bitants greatly excell the people of all the neigh|bouring i&s;lands in the management of their plan|tations. In the low grounds, contiguous to the bay wherein we anchored, the&s;e plantations were regularly divided by deep ditches; the fences were formed with a neatne&s;s approaching to ele|gance, and the roads through them were fini&s;hed in &s;uch a manner, as would have reflected credit even on an European engineer. The longitude of Wymoa Bay, in this i&s;land, is 200&deg; 20&prime; ea&s;t, and its latitude 21&deg; 57&prime; north.</P>
<P>Oneeheow is five or &s;ix leagues to the we&s;tward of Atooi. Its ea&s;tern coa&s;t is high, and ri&s;es with abruptne&s;s from the &s;ea; but the other parts of the i&s;land con&s;i&s;t of low ground, except a round bluff head on the &s;outh-ea&s;tern point. It pro|duces
<PB N="282" REF="030274_1112_0FE5766D8FCC9228">

<P>Oreehoua and Tahoora are two little i&s;lands, &s;ituate in the neighbourhood of Oneeheow. The former an elevated hummock, connected with the northern extreme of Oneeheow, by a reef of coral rocks. Its latitude is 22&deg; 2&prime; north, and its longitude 199&deg; 52&prime; ea&s;t. The latter &s;tands to the &s;outh-ea&s;t, and is uninhabited: its longitude is 199&deg; 36&prime; ea&s;t, and its latitude 21&deg; 43&prime; north.</P>
<P>The climate of the Sandwich I&s;les is, perhaps, rather more temperate than that of the We&s;t India i&s;lands, which are in the &s;ame latitude; but the difference is very incon&s;iderable. The thermo|meter, on &s;hore near Karakakooa Bay, never ro&s;e to a greater height than 88&deg;, and that but one day: its mean height, at twelve o'clock, was 83&deg;. Its mean height at noon, in Wymoa Bay, was 76&deg;, and, when out at &s;ea, 75&deg;. In the i&s;land of Jamaica, the mean height of the thermometer, at twelve o'clock, is about 86&deg;; at &s;ea 80&deg;.</P>
<P>Whether the&s;e i&s;lands are &s;ubject to the &s;ame violent winds and hurricanes with the We&s;t Indies, we could not a&s;certain, as we were not here during any of the tempe&s;tuous months. However, as no ve&s;tiges of their effects were any where to be &s;een, and as the i&s;landers gave us no po&s;itive te&s;timony of the fact, it is probable, that in this particu|lar,
<PB N="283" REF="030274_1113_0FE5763D33A0C048">
they re&s;emble the Friendly and Society I&s;les, which are, in a great degree, free from &s;uch tre|mendous vi&s;itations.</P>
<P>There was a greater quantity of rain, particu|larly in the interior parts, during the four winter months that we continued among the i&s;landers, than commonly falls in the We&s;t-Indies in the dry &s;ea&s;on. We generally ob&s;erved clouds col|lecting round the &s;ummits of the hills, and pro|ducing rain to leeward; but, after the wind has &s;eparated them from the land, they di&s;per&s;e, and are lo&s;t, and others &s;upply their place. This oc|curred daily at Owhyhee; the mountainous parts being u&s;ually enveloped in a cloud; &s;howers &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ively falling in the inland country; with a clear &s;ky, and fine weather, in the neighbour|hood of the &s;hore.</P>
<P>The winds were, for the mo&s;t part, from ea&s;t-&s;outh-ea&s;t to north-ea&s;t. In the harbour of Kara|kakooa we had every day and night a &s;ea and land breeze. The currents &s;ometimes &s;et to windward, and at other times to leeward, without the lea&s;t regularity. They did not &s;eem to be directed by the winds, nor by any other cau&s;e that we can a&s;|&s;ign: they often &s;et to windward again&s;t a fre&s;h breeze.</P>
<P>The tides are exceedingly regular, ebbing and flowing &s;ix hours each. The flood-tide comes from the ea&s;t, and, at the full and change of the moon, it is high-water at three quarters of an
<PB N="284" REF="030274_1114_0FE5766FD525E120">
hour after three o'clock. Their greate&s;t ri&s;e is two feet &s;even inches.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the quadrupeds of the&s;e i&s;lands they are confined to three &s;orts, namely, hogs, dogs, and rats. The dogs are of the &s;ame &s;pecies with tho&s;e we &s;aw at Otaheite, having pricked ears, long backs, and &s;hort crooked legs. We did not ob&s;erve any variety in them, except in their &s;kins; &s;ome being perfectly &s;mooth, and others having long rough hair. They are about as large as a common turn&s;pit, and &s;eem to be extremely &s;luggi&s;h in their nature; though this may, probably, be more owing to the manner in which they are treated, than to their natural di&s;|po&s;ition. They are generally fed with the hogs, and left to herd with tho&s;e animals; and we do not recollect a &s;ingle in&s;tance of a dog being made a companion here, as is the cu&s;tom in Europe. Indeed, the practice of eating them &s;eems to be an in&s;uperable bar to their being admitted into &s;ociety; and as there are no bea&s;ts of prey, nor objects of chace, in the&s;e i&s;lands, the &s;ocial quali|ties of the dog, its attachment, fidelity, and &s;aga|city, will, in all probability, remain unknown to the natives.</P>
<P>It did not appear that the dogs in the Sand|wich i&s;lands were near &s;o numerous, in propor|tion as at Otaheite. But, on the other hand, they have a much greater plenty of hogs, and the breed is of a larger kind. We procured from
<PB N="285" REF="030274_1115_0FE576268FC55A80">
them an amazing &s;upply of provi&s;ions of this &s;ort. We were upwards of three months, either crui&s;|ing off the coa&s;t, or in harbour at Owhyhee; during all which time the crews of both &s;hips had con&s;tantly a large allowance of fre&s;h pork, in&s;o|much that our con&s;umption of that article was computed at about &s;ixty puncheons of five hun|dred weight each. Be&s;ides this quantity, and the extraordinary wa&s;te, which, amid&s;t &s;uch abun|dance, could not be entirely prevented, &s;ixty more puncheons were &s;alted for &s;ea &s;tore. The greater part of this &s;upply was drawn from the i&s;le of Owhyhee alone; and yet we did not per|ceive that it was at all exhau&s;ted, or even that the plenty had decrea&s;ed.</P>
<P>The birds of the&s;e i&s;lands are numerous, though the variety is not great. Some of them may vie with tho&s;e of any country in point of beauty. There are four &s;pecies that &s;eem to belong to the <HI>trochili,</HI> or honey-&s;uckers of Linnaeus. One of them is &s;omewhat larger than a bullfinch; its colour is a glo&s;&s;y black, and the thighs and rump|vent are of a deep yellow. The natives call it <HI>hoohoo.</HI> Another is of a very bright &s;carlet; its wings are black, with a white edge, and its tail is black. It is named <HI>eeeeve</HI> by the inhabitants. The third is variegated with brown, yellow, and red, and &s;eems to be either a young bird, or a variety of the preceding. The fourth is entirely green, with yellow tinge, and is called <HI>akaiearooa.</HI>
<PB N="286" REF="030274_1116_0FE57671595F1630">
There is al&s;o a &s;mall bird of the fly-catcher kind; a &s;pecies of thru&s;h, with a greyi&s;h brea&s;t; and a rail, with very &s;hort wings, and no tail. Ravens are met with here, but they are extremely &s;carce; they are of a dark brown colour, inclining to black, and their note is different from that of the European raven.</P>
<P>We found here two &s;mall birds, that were very common, and both of which were of one <HI>genus.</HI> One of the&s;e was red, and was u&s;ually ob&s;erved about the cocoa-trees, from whence it &s;eemed to derive a con&s;iderable part of its &s;ub&s;i&s;tance. The other was of a green colour. Both had long tongues, which were ciliated, or fringed at the tip. A bird with a yellow head was likewi&s;e very commom here: from the &s;tructure of its beak, our people called it a prrroquet: it, how|ever, does not belong to that tribe, but bears a great re&s;emblance to the <HI>lexia flavicans,</HI> or yellow|i&s;h cro&s;s bill of Linnaeus. Here are al&s;o owls, curlews, petrels, and gannets; plovers of two &s;pecies, one nearly the &s;ame as our whi&s;tling plover; a large white pigeon; the common water-hen; and a long tailed bird, which is of a black colour, and the vent and feathers under the wings yellow.</P>
<P>The vegetable produce of the Sandwich I&s;les is not very different from that of the other i&s;lands of the Pacific Ocean. We have already ob&s;erved that the <HI>taro</HI> root, as here cultivated, was &s;uperior
<PB N="287" REF="030274_1117_0FE5770397045968">
to any we had before ta&s;ted. The bread-fruit-trees thrive here, not indeed in &s;uch abundance as at Otaheite, but they produce twice as much fruit as they do on the rich plains of that i&s;land. The trees are nearly of the &s;ame height; but the branches &s;hoot out from the trunk con&s;iderably lower, and with greater luxuriance of vegetation. The &s;ugar-canes of the&s;e i&s;lands grow to an ex|traordinary &s;ize. One of them was brought to us at Atooi, who&s;e circumference was eleven inches and a quarter; and it had fourteen feet eatable. At Oneeheow we &s;aw &s;ome large brown roots, from &s;ix to ten pounds in weight, re|&s;embling a yam in &s;hape. The juice, of which they yield a great quantity, is very &s;weet, and is an excellent <HI>&s;uccedaneum</HI> for &s;ugar. The natives are exceedingly fond of it, and make u&s;e of it as an article of their common diet; and our people likewi&s;e found it very palatable and whole&s;ome. Not being able to procure the leaves of this vegetable, we could not a&s;certain to what &s;pecies of plant it belonged; but we &s;uppo&s;ed it to be the root of &s;ome kind of fern.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE natives of the Sandwich I&s;les are doubt|le&s;s of the &s;ame extraction with the inhabi|tants of the Friendly and Society I&s;lands, of New-Zealand, the Marque&s;as, and Ea&s;ter I&s;land; a race which po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es all the known lands between the longitudes of 157&deg; and 260&prime; ea&s;t, and between the latitudes of 47&deg; &s;outh, and 22&deg; north. This
<PB N="289" REF="030274_1119_0FE576299ABC8350">
fact, extraordinary as it is, is not only evinced by the general re&s;emblance of their per&s;ons, and the great &s;imilarity of their manners and cu&s;toms, but &s;eems to be e&s;tabli&s;hed, beyond all controver&s;y, by the identity of their language. It may not, perhaps, be very difficult to conjecture, from what continent they originally emigrated, and by what &s;teps they have diffu&s;ed them&s;elves over &s;o immen&s;e a &s;pace. They bear &s;trong marks of affinity to &s;ome of the Indian tribes, which inha|bit the Landrones and Caroline I&s;les; and the &s;ame affinity and re&s;emblance, may al&s;o be traced among the Malays and the Battas. At what parti|cular time the&s;e migrations happened is le&s;s ea&s;y to a&s;certain; the period, in all probability, was not very late, as they are very populous, and have no tradition re&s;pecting their own origin, but what is wholly fabulous; though, on the other hand, the &s;implicity which is &s;till prevalent in their manners and habits of life, and the unadul|terated &s;tate of their general language, &s;eem to demon&s;trate, that it could not have been at any very remote period.</P>
<P>The Sandwich I&s;landers, in general, exceed the middle &s;ize, and are well made. They walk in a very graceful manner, run with con&s;iderable agility, and are capable of enduring a great de|gree of fatigue&punc; but, upon the whole, the men are inferior, with re&s;pect to activity and &s;trength, to the inhabitants of the Friendly I&s;lands, and
<PB N="290" REF="030274_1120_0FE5762180111ED0">
the women are le&s;s delicate in the formation of their limbs than the Otaheitean females. Their complexion is &s;omewhat darker than that of the Otaheiteans; and they are not altogether &s;o hand|&s;ome in their per&s;ons as the natives of the Society I&s;les. Many of both &s;exes, however, had fine open countenances<NOTE PLACE="foot">The annexed repre&s;entation of a man of the Sandwich I&s;les, was taken from a portrait of our friend Kaneena.</NOTE>; and the women, in parti|cular, had white well &s;et teeth, good eyes, and an engaging &s;weetne&s;s and &s;en&s;ibility of look.</P>
<P>The hair of the&s;e people is of a browni&s;h black, neither uniformly curling like that of the Afri|can negroes, nor uniformly &s;traight, as among the Indians of America; but varying, in this re|&s;pect, like the hair of Europeans. There is one &s;triking peculiarity in the features of every part of this great nation; which is, that, even in the mo&s;t hand&s;ome faces, there is always ob&s;ervable, a fullne&s;s of the no&s;tril, without any flatne&s;s or &s;preading of the no&s;e, that di&s;tingui&s;hes them from the inhabitants of Europe. It is not wholly improbable, that this may be the effect of their cu&s;tomary method of &s;alutation, which is per|formed by pre&s;&s;ing together the extremities of their no&s;es.</P>
<P>The &s;ame &s;uperiority that we generally ob|&s;erved at other i&s;lands in the per&s;ons of the <HI>Erees,</HI> is likewi&s;e found here. Tho&s;e that were &s;een by us were perfectly well formed; whereas the lower
<PB N="291" REF="030274_1121_0FE5762B968D7FA0">
cla&s;s of people, be&s;ides their general inferiority, are &s;ubject to all the variety of figure and make, that is met with in the populace of other parts of the world.</P>
<P>There are more frequent in&s;tances of defor|mity here, than in any of the other i&s;lands we vi&s;ited. While we were crui&s;ing off Owhyhee, two dwarfs came on board; one of whom was an old man, of the height of four feet two inches, but very well proportioned; and the other was a woman, nearly of the &s;ame &s;tature. We after|wards &s;aw, among the natives, three who were humpbacked, and a young man who had been de&s;titute of hands and feet, from the very mo|ment of his birth. Squinting is al&s;o common among them; and a man, who, they told us, had been born blind, was brought to us for the pur|po&s;e of being cured. Be&s;ides the&s;e particular defects, they are, in general, extremely &s;ubject to boils and ulcers, which &s;ome of us a&s;cribed to the great quantity of &s;alt they u&s;ually eat with their fi&s;h and fle&s;h. Though the <HI>Erees</HI> are free from the&s;e complaints, many of them experience &s;till more dreadful effects from the too frequent u&s;e of the <HI>ava.</HI> Tho&s;e who were the mo&s;t affected by it, had their eyes red and iflamed, their limbs emaciated, their bodies covered with a whiti&s;h &s;curf, and their whole frame trembling and paralytic, attended with a di&s;ability of rai&s;ing their heads.</P>
<P><PB N="292" REF="030274_1122_0FE5761C1F3CE320">Though it does not appear that this drug uni|ver&s;ally &s;hortens life, (for Terreeoboo, Kaoo, and &s;everal other chiefs, were far advanced in years) yet it invariably brings on a premature and decrepid old age. It is a fortunate circum&s;tance for the people, that the u&s;e of it is made a pecu|liar privilege of the chiefs. The young &s;on of Terreeoboo, who did not exceed twelve or thir|teen years of age, frequently boa&s;ted of his being admitted to drink <HI>ava;</HI> and &s;hewed us, with marks of exultation, a &s;mall &s;pot in his &s;ide that was beginning to grow &s;caly.</P>
<P>When Captain Cook fir&s;t vi&s;ited the Society I&s;les, this pernicious drug was very little known among them. In his &s;econd voyage, he found it greatly in vogue at Ulietea; but it had &s;till gained little ground at Otaheite. During the la&s;t time we were there, the havock it had made was almo&s;t incredible, in&s;omuch that Captain Cook &s;carce recognized many of his former acquaint|ances. It is al&s;o con&s;tantly drank by the chiefs of the Friendly I&s;les, but &s;o much diluted with water, that it &s;carcely produces any bad con&s;e|quences. At Atooi, likewi&s;e, it is u&s;ed with great moderation; and the chiefs of that i&s;land are, on this account, a much finer &s;et of men than tho&s;e of the neighbouring i&s;lands. It was remarked by us, that, upon di&s;continuing the u&s;e of this root, its noxious effects quickly wore off. We prevailed upon our friends Kaoo and
<PB N="293" REF="030274_1123_0FE5762816721BE8">
Kaireekeea, to ab&s;tain from it; and they reco|vered &s;urpri&s;ingly during the &s;hort time we after|wards remained among them.</P>
<P>To form any probable conjectures with regard to the population of i&s;lands, with many parts of which we have but an imperfect acquaintance, may be thought highly difficult. There are two circum&s;tances, however, which remove much of this objection. One is, that the interior parts of the country are almo&s;t entirely uninhabited: if, therefore, the number of tho&s;e who inhabit the parts adjoining to the coa&s;t, be a&s;certained, the whole will be determined with &s;ome degree of accuracy. The other circum&s;tance is, that there are no towns of any con&s;iderable extent, the hou&s;es of the i&s;landers being pretty equally &s;cat|tered in &s;mall villages round all their coa&s;ts. On the&s;e grounds we &s;hall venture at a rough calcu|lation of the number of per&s;ons in this clu&s;ter of i&s;lands.</P>
<P>Karakakooa bay, in Owhyhee, is about three miles in extent, and comprehends four villages of about eighty hou&s;es each, upon an average, in all three hundred and twenty; be&s;ides many &s;traggling habitations, which may make the whole amount to three hundred and fifty. If we allow &s;ix people to each hou&s;e, the country about the bay will then contain two thou&s;and one hun|dred per&s;ons. To the&s;e we may add fifty fami|lies, or three hundred &s;ouls, which we imagine
<PB N="294" REF="030274_1124_0FE576144FF6A3B0">
to be nearly the number employed among the plantations in the interior parts of the i&s;land; making, in all, two thou&s;and four hundred. If this number be applied to the whole coa&s;t round the i&s;land, a quarter being deducted for the un|inhabited parts, it will be found to contain a hun|dred and fifty thou&s;and per&s;ons. The other Sand|wich I&s;lands, by the &s;ame method of calculation, will appear to contain the following number of inhabitants: Mowee, &s;ixty-five thou&s;and four hundred; Atooi, fifty-four thou&s;and; Morotoi, thirty-&s;ix thou&s;and; Woahoo, &s;ixty thou&s;and two hundred; Ranai, twenty thou&s;and four hundred; Oneeheow, ten thou&s;and; and Oreehoua, four thou&s;and. The&s;e numbers, including the hun|dred and fifty thou&s;and in Owhyhee, will amount to four hundred thou&s;and: In this computation we have by no means exceeded the truth in the total amount.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be acknowledged, notwith&s;tanding the great lo&s;s we &s;u&s;tained from the &s;udden re&s;ent|ment and violence of the&s;e i&s;landers, that they are of a very mild and affectionate di&s;po&s;ition, equally remote from the di&s;tant gravity and re|&s;erve of the natives of the Friendly I&s;les, and the extreme volatility of the Otaheiteans. They &s;eem to live in the greate&s;t friend&s;hip and harmony with each other. Tho&s;e women who had chil|dren, &s;hewed a remarkable affection for them, and paid them a particular and con&s;tant attention;
<PB N="295" REF="030274_1125_0FE576052CB000A0">
and the men, with a willingne&s;s that did honour to their feelings, frequently afforded their a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance in tho&s;e dome&s;tic employments. We mu&s;t, however, remark, that they are greatly inferior to the inhabitants of the other i&s;lands, in that be&s;t criterion of civilized manners, the re&s;pect paid to the female &s;ex. Here the women are not only deprived of the privilege of eating with the men, but are forbidden to feed on the be&s;t &s;orts of provi&s;ions. Turtle, pork, &s;everal kinds of fi&s;h, and &s;ome &s;pecies of plantains, are denied them; and we were informed, that a girl received a vio|lent beating, for having eaten, while &s;he was on board one of our &s;hips, a prohibited article of food. With regard to their dome&s;tic life, they &s;eem to live almo&s;t wholly by them&s;elves, and meet with little attention from the men, though no in&s;tances of per&s;onal ill-treatment were ob|&s;erved by us.</P>
<P>We have already had occa&s;ion to mention the great kindne&s;s and ho&s;pitality, with which they treated us. Whenever we went a&s;hore, there was a continual &s;truggle who &s;hould be mo&s;t forward in offering little pre&s;ents for our acceptance, bringing provi&s;ions and refre&s;hments, or te&s;tify|ing &s;ome other mark of re&s;pect. The aged per|&s;ons con&s;tantly received us with tears of joy, ap|peared to be highly gratified with being permit|ted to touch us, and were frequently drawing compari&s;ons between us and them&s;elves, with
<PB N="296" REF="030274_1126_0FE5763EB823BFF8">
marks of extreme humility. The young women, likewi&s;e, were exceedingly kind and engaging, and attached them&s;elves to us, without re&s;erve, till they perceived, notwith&s;tanding all our en|deavours to prevent it, that they had cau&s;e to re|pent of our acquaintance. It mu&s;t, however, be ob&s;erved, that the&s;e females were, in all proba|bility of the inferior cla&s;s; for we &s;aw very few women of rank during our continuance here.</P>
<P>The&s;e people, in point of natural capacity, are, by no means below the common &s;tandard of the human race. The excellence of their manufac|tures, and their improvements in agriculture, are doubtle&s;s adequate to their &s;ituation and natural advantages. The eagerne&s;s of curio&s;ity, with which they u&s;ed to attend the armourer's forge, and the various expedients which they had in|vented, even before our departure from the&s;e i&s;lands, for working the iron obtained from us, into &s;uch forms as were be&s;t calculated for their purpo&s;es, were &s;trong indications of docility and ingenuity. Our unhappy friend, Kaneena, was endowed with a remarkable quickne&s;s of concep|tion, and a great degree of judicious curio&s;ity. He was extremely inqui&s;itive with re&s;pect to our manners and cu&s;toms. He enquired after our &s;overeign; the form of our government; the mode of con&s;tructing our &s;hips; the productions of our country; our numbers; our method of building hou&s;es; whether we waged any wars;
<PB N="297" REF="030274_1127_0FE576306CD5C880">
with whom, on what occa&s;ion, and in what parti|cular manner they were carried on; who was our Deity; be&s;ides many other que&s;tions of a &s;imilar import, which &s;eemed to indicate a com|prehen&s;ive under&s;tanding. We ob&s;erved two in|&s;tances of per&s;ons di&s;ordered in their &s;en&s;es; the one a woman at Oneeheow, the other a man at Owhyhee. From the extraordinary re&s;pect and attention paid to them, it appeared, that the opinion of their being divinely in&s;pired, which prevails among mo&s;t of the oriental nations, is al&s;o countenanced here.</P>
<P>It is highly probable, that the practice of feed|ing on the bodies of enemies was originally pre|valent in all the i&s;lands of the Pacific Ocean, though it is not known by po&s;itive and deci&s;ive evidence, to exi&s;t in any of them, except New-Zealand. The offering up human victims, which is manife&s;tly a relique of this barbarous cu&s;tom, &s;till univer&s;ally prevails among the&s;e i&s;landers; and it is not difficult to conceive why the inha|bitants of New-Zealand &s;hould retain the repa&s;t, which was, perhaps, the concluding part of the&s;e horrid rites, for a longer period than the re&s;t of their tribe who were &s;ituated in more fertile re|gions. As the Sandwich i&s;landers, both in their per&s;ons and di&s;po&s;ition, bear a nearer re&s;emblance to the New-Zealanders, than to any other people of this very exten&s;ive race, Mr. Ander&s;on was &s;trongly inclined to &s;u&s;pect, that, like them, they
<PB N="298" REF="030274_1128_0FE57606B16AC990">
are &s;till cannibals. The evidence, which induced him to entertain this opinion, has been already laid down in the tenth chapter of the third book; but, as Mr. King had great doubts of the ju&s;t|ne&s;s of his conclu&s;ions, we &s;hall mention the grounds on which he ventured to differ from him. With regard to the intelligence received on this head from the natives them&s;elves, it may not be improper to ob&s;erve, that mo&s;t of the officers on board took great pains to inquire into &s;o curious a circum&s;tance; and that, except in the in&s;tances above referred to, the i&s;landers invariably denied that any &s;uch practice exi&s;ted among them.</P>
<P>Though Mr. Ander&s;on's &s;uperior knowledge of the language of tho&s;e people ought certainly to give con&s;iderable weight to his judgment, yet when he examined the man who had the little parcel containing a piece of &s;alted fle&s;h, Mr. King, who was pre&s;ent on that occa&s;ion, was &s;trongly of opinion, that the &s;igns made u&s;e of by the i&s;lander intimated nothing more, than that it was de&s;igned to be eaten, and that it was very agreeable or whole&s;ome to the &s;tomach. In this &s;entiment Mr. King was confirmed, by a circum|&s;tance of which he was informed, after the de|cea&s;e of his ingenious friend Mr Ander&s;on, namely, that mo&s;t of the inhabitants of the&s;e i&s;lands carried about with them a &s;mall piece of raw pork, well &s;alted, either put into a calliba&s;h, or wrapped up in &s;ome cloth, and fa&s;tened round
<PB N="299" REF="030274_1129_0FE5763370EF9E50">
the wai&s;t: this they e&s;teemed a great delicacy, and would frequently ta&s;te it. With regard to the confu&s;ion the lad was in, (for his age did not exceed &s;ixte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n or eighteen years) no per&s;on could have been &s;urpri&s;ed at it, who had been witne&s;s of the earne&s;t and eager manner in which Mr. Ander&s;on interrogated him.</P>
<P>Mr. King found it le&s;s ea&s;y to controvert the argument deduced from the u&s;e of the in&s;trument made with &s;harks teeth, which is of a &s;imilar form with that u&s;ed by the New-Zealanders for cutting up the bodies of their enemies. Though he believed it to be an undoubted fact, that they never make u&s;e of this in&s;trument in cutting the fle&s;h of other animals, yet, as the practice of &s;a|crificing human victims, and of burning the bo|dies of the &s;lain, &s;till prevails here, he con&s;idered it as not altogether improbable, that the u&s;e of this knife (if it may be &s;o denomin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ed) is retain|ed in tho&s;e ceremonies. He was, upon the whole, inclined to imagine, and particularly from the la&s;t-mentioned circum&s;tance, that the horrible cu&s;tom of devouring human fle&s;h has but lately cea&s;ed in the&s;e and other i&s;lands of the Pacific Ocean. Omai acknowledged, that his country|men, in&s;tigated by the fury of revenge, would &s;ometimes tear with their teeth the fle&s;h of their &s;lain enemies; but he peremptorily denied that they ever eat it. The denial is a &s;trong indica|tion that the practice has cea&s;ed; for in New-Zealand,
<PB N="300" REF="030274_1130_0FE5761242BEA6E8">
where it is &s;till prevalent, the natives never &s;crupled to confe&s;s it.</P>
<P>The Sandwich I&s;landers, almo&s;t univer&s;ally, permit their beards to grow. There were, how|ever, a few who cut off their beards entirely, among whom was the aged king; and others wore it only on their upper lip. The &s;ame variety that is found among the other i&s;landers of this ocean, with re&s;pect to the mode of wearing the hair, is likewi&s;e ob&s;ervable here. They have be|&s;ides a fa&s;hion which &s;eems to be peculiar to them|&s;elves: they cut it clo&s;e on each &s;ide of their heads, down to their ears and leave a ridge, of the breadth of a &s;mall hand, extending from the forehead to the neck; which, when the hair is pretty thick and curling, re&s;embles, in point of form, the cre&s;t of the helmet of an ancient war|rior. Some of them wear great quantities of fal&s;e hair, flowing in long ringlets down their backs; while others tie it into one round bunch on the upper part of their heads, nearly as large as the head it&s;elf; and &s;ome into &s;ix or &s;even &s;e|parate bunches. They u&s;e, for the purpo&s;e of daubing or &s;mearing their hair, a greyi&s;h clay, mixed with &s;hells reduced to powder, which they keep in balls, and chew into a &s;ort of pa&s;te, whenever they intend to make u&s;e of it. This compo&s;ition pre&s;erves the &s;moothne&s;s of the hair, and changes it, in proce&s;s of time, to a palo yellow.</P>
<P><PB N="301" REF="030274_1131_0FE5763501EEEF20">Necklaces, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;trings of &s;mall varie|gated &s;hells, are worn by both men and women. They al&s;o wear an ornament, about two inches in length, and half an inch in breadth, &s;haped like the handle of a cup, and made of &s;tone, wood, or ivory, extremely well poli&s;hed; this is hung round the neck by fine threads of twi&s;ted hair, which are &s;ometimes doubled an hundred fold. Some of them, in&s;tead of this ornament, wear a &s;mall human figure on their brea&s;t, formed of bone, and &s;u&s;pended in a &s;imilar manner.</P>
<P>Both &s;exes make u&s;e of the fan, or fly-flap, by way of u&s;e and ornament. The mo&s;t common &s;ort is compo&s;ed of cocoa-nut fibres, tied loo&s;ely in bunches, to the top of a poli&s;hed handle. The tail-feathers of the cock, and tho&s;e of the tropic-bird, are u&s;ed for the &s;ame purpo&s;e. Tho&s;e that are mo&s;t in e&s;teem, are &s;uch as have the handle formed of the leg or arm bones of an enemy killed in battle; the&s;e are pre&s;erved with extraordinary care, and are handed down, from father to &s;on, as trophies of the highe&s;t value.</P>
<P>The practice of <HI>tatooing,</HI> or puncturing the body, prevails among the&s;e people; and of all the i&s;lands in this ocean, it is only at New-Zea|land, and the Sandwich I&s;les, that the face is <HI>tatooed.</HI> There is this difference between the&s;e two nations, that the New-Zealanders perform this operation in elegant &s;piral volutes, and the

Sandwich I&s;landers in &s;traight lines, that inter&s;ect each other at right angles.</P>
<P>Some of the natives had half their body, from head to foot <HI>tatooed,</HI> which gave them a mo&s;t &s;trik|ing appearance. It is generally done with great neatne&s;s and regularity. Several of them have only an arm thus marked; others, a leg; &s;ome, again, <HI>tatoo</HI> both an arm and a leg; and others only the hand. The hands and arms of the women are punctured in a very neat manner; and they have a remarkable cu&s;tom of <HI>tatooing</HI> the tip of the tongues of &s;ome of the females. We had &s;ome rea&s;on to imagine, that the practice of puncturing is often intended as a &s;ign of mourning, on the decea&s;e of a chief, or any other calamitous occurrence: for we were frequently informed that &s;uch a mark was in memory of &s;uch a chief; and &s;o of the others. The people of the lowe&s;t order are <HI>tatooed</HI> with a particular mark, which di&s;tingui&s;hes them as the property of the chiefs to whom they are re&s;pective|ly &s;ubject.</P>
<P>The common dre&s;s of the men of all ranks con&s;i&s;ts, in general, of a piece of thick cloth called the <HI>maro,</HI> about a foot in breadth, which pa&s;&s;es between the legs, and is fa&s;tened round the wai&s;t. Their mats, which are of various &s;izes, but, for the mo&s;t part, about five feet in length, and four in breadth, are thrown over their &s;houlders, and brought forward before. The&s;e, however, are rarely made u&s;e of, except in time
<PB N="303" REF="030274_1133_0FE5761DCE6B0E28">
of war, for which purpo&s;e they appear to be better calculated than for common u&s;e, &s;ince they are of a thick heavy texture, and capable of break|ing the blow of a &s;tone or of any blunt weapon. They generally go bare-footed, except when they travel over burnt &s;tones, on which occa&s;ion they &s;ecure their feet with a kind of &s;andal, which is made of cords, twi&s;ted from cocoa-nut fibres.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides their ordinary dre&s;s, there is another, which is appropriated to their chiefs, and worn only on extraordinary occa&s;ions. It con&s;i&s;ts of a feathered cloak and cap, or helmet, of uncom|mon beauty and magnificence. This dre&s;s having been minutely de&s;cribed, in a former part of our work, we have only to add, that the&s;e cloaks are of different lengths, in proportion to the rank of the per&s;on who wears them; &s;ome trailing on the ground, and others no lower than the middle. The chiefs of inferior rank have likewi&s;e a &s;hort cloak, which re&s;embles the former, and is made of the long tail-feathers of the cock, the man-of-war bird, and the tropic-bird, having a broad border of &s;mall yellow and red feathers, and al&s;o a collar of the &s;ame. Others are compo&s;ed of white feathers with variegated borders. The cap or helmet, has a &s;trong lining of wicker-work, &s;ufficient to break the blow of any warlike weapon; for which purpo&s;e it appears to be intended. The&s;e feathered dre&s;&s;es &s;eemed to be very &s;carce, and to be worn only by the male &s;ex. During
<PB N="304" REF="030274_1134_0FE576B9B54DFB18">
our whole continuance in Karakakooa Bay, we never ob&s;erved them u&s;ed, except on three occa|&s;ions; fir&s;t in the remarkable ceremony of Ter|reeoboo's fir&s;t vi&s;it to our &s;hips; &s;econdly, by &s;ome chiefs, who appeared among the crowd on &s;hore, when our unfortunate commander was killed; and thirdly, when his bones were brought to us by Eappo.</P>
<P>The &s;triking re&s;emblance of this habit to the cloak and helmet which the Spaniards formerly wore, excited our curio&s;ity to enquire, whether there might not be &s;ome rea&s;onable grounds for imagining that it had been borrowed from them. After all our endeavours to gain information on this head, we found, that the natives had no immediate acquaintance with any other people whatever; and that no tradition exi&s;ted among them of the&s;e i&s;lands having ever before received a vi&s;it from &s;uch ve&s;&s;els as our's. However, not|with&s;tanding the re&s;ult of our enquiries on this &s;ubject, the form of this habit &s;eems to be a &s;uf|ficient indication of its European origin; parti|cularly when we reflect on another circum&s;tance, viz. that it is a remarkable deviation from the general agreement of dre&s;s, which is prevalent among the &s;everal branches of this great tribe, di&s;per&s;ed over the Pacific Ocean. From this conclu&s;ion, we were induced to &s;uppo&s;e, that &s;ome Buccaneer, or Spani&s;h &s;hip, might have been wrecked in the neighbourhood of the&s;e
<PB N="305" REF="030274_1135_0FE5760895AC81F8">
i&s;lands. When it is con&s;idered, that the cour&s;e of the Spani&s;h trading ve&s;&s;els from Acapulco to Manilla, is not many degrees to the &s;outh of the Sandwich I&s;les, in their pa&s;&s;age out, and to the north, on their return, this &s;uppo&s;ition will not, we think, be deemed improbable.</P>
<P>There is very little difference between the com|mon dre&s;s of the men and that of the women. The latter wear a piece of cloth wrapped round the wai&s;t, which de&s;cends half way down their thighs; and &s;ometimes, during the cool of the evening, they throw loo&s;e pieces of fine cloth over their &s;houlders, like the Otaheitean females. The <HI>pan</HI> is another dre&s;s, which the younger part of the &s;ex often wear; it con&s;i&s;ts of the thinne&s;t and fine&s;t cloth, wrapped &s;everal times about the middle, and reaching down to the leg; &s;o that it has the appearance of a full &s;hort petticoat. They cut their hair &s;hort behind, and turn it up be|fore, as is the cu&s;tom among the New-Zealanders and Otaheiteans. One woman, indeed, whom we &s;aw in Karakakooa Bay, had her hair arranged in a very &s;ingular mode; &s;he had turned it up behind, and having brought it over her forehead, and doubled it back, &s;o that it formed a &s;ort of &s;hade to her face, and &s;omewhat re&s;embled a &s;mall bonnet.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides their necklaces, which are compo&s;ed of &s;hells, or of a &s;hining, hard, red berry, they wear dried flowers of the Indian mallow, formed
<PB N="306" REF="030274_1136_0FE5768397FB5BC8">
into wreaths; and likewi&s;e another elegant orna|ment, termed <HI>craie,</HI> which is &s;ometimes fa&s;tened round the hair, in the manner of a garland, but is u&s;ually put round the neck; though it is occa|&s;ionally worn in both the&s;e ways at once, as may be &s;een in the annexed repre&s;entation of the wo|man of the Sandwich I&s;lands. It is a kind of ruff, about as thick as a finger, formed with great ingenuity, of very &s;mall feathers, woven together &s;o clo&s;ely, that the &s;urface may be &s;aid to equal the riche&s;t velvet in &s;moothne&s;s. The ground is, in general, red, with alternate circles of black, yellow, and green.</P>
<P>We have already de&s;cribed their bracelets, of which they have a great variety. Some of the women of Atooi wear &s;mall figures of the turtle, made very neatly of ivory or wood, fa&s;tened on their fingers in the &s;ame manner that rings are worn by us. There is likewi&s;e an ornament con|&s;i&s;ting of &s;hells, tied in rows on a ground of &s;trong net-work, &s;o as to &s;trike again&s;t each other, while in motion; which both &s;exes, when they dance, fa&s;ten either round the ankles, or ju&s;t below the knee, or round the arm. They &s;ometimes, in|&s;tead of &s;hells, u&s;e for this purpo&s;e, the teeth of dogs, and a hard red berry.</P>
<P>Another ornament, if indeed it de&s;erves that appellation, remains to be de&s;cribed. It is a &s;ort of ma&s;k, compo&s;ed of a large gourd, having holes cut in it for the no&s;e and eyes. The top of it is
<PB N="307" REF="030274_1137_0FE576A6028CF828">
&s;tuck full of little green twigs, which appear, at &s;ome di&s;tance, like a waving plume; and the lower part has narrow &s;tripes of cloth hanging from it, &s;omewhat re&s;embling a beard, The&s;e ma&s;ks we never &s;aw worn but on two occa&s;ions, and both times by a number of per&s;ons a&s;&s;embled in a canoe, who approached the &s;ide of the &s;hip, laughing and making droll ge&s;ticulations. We could never learn whether they were not al&s;o made u&s;e of as a defence for the head again&s;t &s;tones, or in &s;ome of their public &s;ports and games, or were di&s;gui&s;ed merely for the purpo&s;es of mummery.</P>
<P>They dwell together in &s;mall towns or villages, which contain from about one hundred to two hundred hou&s;es, built pretty clo&s;e to each other without order or regularity, and have a winding path that leads through them. They are fre|quently flanked towards the &s;ea-&s;ide, with loo&s;e detached walls, which are, in all probability, in|tended for &s;helter, and defence. The form of their habitations, we have before de&s;cribed. They are of various dimen&s;ions, from forty-five feet by twenty-four, to eighteen by twelve. Some are of a larger &s;ize, being fifty feet in length, and thirty in breadth, and entirely open at one end. The&s;e, we were informed, were de&s;igned for the accommodation of &s;trangers or travellers, who&s;e &s;tay was likely to be &s;hort.</P>
<P><PB N="308" REF="030274_1138_0FE5764C97295240">Their furniture having been already mention|ed, we have only to add, that, at one end of their hou&s;es, are mats, on which they repo&s;e, with wooden pillows, or &s;leeping-&s;tools, perfectly re|&s;embling tho&s;e of the Chine&s;e. Some of the be&s;t hou&s;es have a court-yard before them, railed in very neatly, with &s;maller habitations for &s;ervants erected round it: in this area the family u&s;ually eat and &s;it in the day-time. In the &s;ides of the hills and among&s;t the &s;teep rocks, we &s;aw &s;everal holes or caves, which &s;eemed to be inhabited; but, the entrance being defended by wicker-work, and, in the only one that we vi&s;ited, a &s;tone fence being ob&s;erved running acro&s;s it within, we &s;up|po&s;ed that they were chiefly intended as places of retreat, in ca&s;e of an attack from enemies.</P>
<P>The people of an inferior cla&s;s feed principally on fi&s;h, and vegetables, &s;uch as plantains, bread-fruit, &s;weet-potatoes, &s;ugar-canes, yams, and <HI>taro.</HI> To the&s;e, per&s;ons of &s;uperior rank add the fle&s;h of dogs and hogs, dre&s;&s;ed after the &s;ame method that is practi&s;ed in the Society's I&s;les. They like|wi&s;e eat fowls of a dome&s;tic kind, which, how|ever, are neither plentiful, nor in any great degree of e&s;timation.</P>
<P>Though, on our fir&s;t arrival at the&s;e i&s;lands, yams and bread-fruit &s;eemed &s;carce, we did not find this to be the ca&s;e on our &s;econd vi&s;it: it is therefore probable, that, as the&s;e vegetable articles were commonly planted in the interior parts of
<PB N="309" REF="030274_1139_0FE5769CEABFCD48">
the country, the i&s;landers had not had &s;ufficient time for bringing them down to us, during our &s;hort continuance in Wymoa bay, on our fir&s;t vi&s;it.</P>
<P>They &s;alt their fi&s;h, and pre&s;erve them in gourd-&s;hells; not, indeed, with a view of providing again&s;t an occa&s;ional &s;carcity, but from the incli|nation they have for &s;alted provi&s;ions; for we al&s;o found, that the chiefs frequently had pieces of pork pickled in the &s;ame manner, which they con|&s;idered as a great delicacy. Their cookery is much the &s;ame as at the Friendly and Society I&s;lands; and though &s;ome of our people di&s;liked their <HI>taro</HI> puddings, on account of their &s;ourne&s;s, others were of a different opinion. It is remark|able, that they had not acquired the art of pre|&s;erving the bread-fruit, and making of it the &s;our pa&s;te named <HI>maihee,</HI> as is the practice at the So|ciety I&s;les; and it afforded us great &s;atisfaction, that we had it in our power to communicate to them this u&s;eful &s;ecret, in return for the generous and ho&s;pitable treatment we received from them.</P>
<P>They are very cleanly at their meals; and their method of dre&s;&s;ing both their vegetable and animal food, was univer&s;ally acknowledged to be &s;uperior to ours. The <HI>Erees</HI> con&s;tantly begin their meals with a do&s;e of the extract of pepper-root, or <HI>ava,</HI> prepared in the u&s;ual mode. The women eat apart from the other &s;ex, and are pro|hibited, as before ob&s;erved, from feeding on pork,
<PB N="310" REF="030274_1140_0FE576C9210EB908">
turtle, and &s;ome particular &s;pecies of plantains. Notwith&s;tanding this interdiction, they would privately eat pork with us; but we could never prevail on them to ta&s;te the two latter articles of food.</P>
<P>They generally ri&s;e with the &s;un; and, after having enjoyed the cool of the evening, retire to their repo&s;e a few hours after &s;un-&s;et. The <HI>Erees</HI> are occupied in making canoes and mats; the <HI>Towtows</HI> are chiefly employed in the planta|tions, and al&s;o in fi&s;hing; and the women are en|gaged in the manufactory of cloth. They amu&s;e them&s;elves in their lei&s;ure hours, with various diver&s;ions. Their young per&s;ons, of both &s;exes, are fond of dancing; and, on more &s;olemn oc|ca&s;ions, they entertain them&s;elves with wre&s;tling and boxing matches, performed after the man|ner of the natives of the Friendly I&s;lands; to whom, however, they are greatly inferior in all the&s;e re&s;pects.</P>
<P>Their dances, which bear a greater re&s;emblance to tho&s;e of the New-Zealanders, than of the Friendly or Society I&s;landers, are introduced with a &s;olemn kind of &s;ong, in which the whole number join, the &s;ame time &s;lowly moving their legs, and gently &s;triking their brea&s;ts; their attitudes and manner being very ea&s;y and graceful. So far they re&s;emble the dances of the Society I&s;les. After this has continued for the &s;pace of about ten minutes, they gradually quicken both the
<PB N="311" REF="030274_1141_0FE5770EB006EC00">
tune and the motions, and do not de&s;i&s;t till they are oppre&s;&s;ed with fatigue. This part of the per|formance is the counterpart of that of the inha|bitants of New-Zealand; and, as among tho&s;e people, the per&s;on who&s;e action is the mo&s;t vio|lent, and who continues this exerci&s;e the longe&s;t, is applauded by the &s;pectators as the be&s;t dancer. It mu&s;t be remarked, that, in this dance, the females only engage; and that the dances of the men re&s;emble what we &s;aw of the &s;mall parties at the Friendly I&s;les; and which may, perhaps, more properly be termed the accompaniment of &s;ongs, with corre&s;pondent motions of the whole body. But as we &s;aw &s;ome boxing exhibitions, of the &s;ame kind with tho&s;e we had &s;een at the Friendly I&s;les, it is not improbable that they had likewi&s;e here their grand ceremonious dances, wherein numbers both of men and women were performers.</P>
<P>The mu&s;ic of the&s;e people is of a rude kind; for the only mu&s;ical in&s;truments that we ob&s;erved among them, were drums of various &s;izes. Their &s;ongs, however, which they are &s;aid to &s;ing in parts,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The circum&s;tance of their &s;inging in parts, has been doubted by &s;everal per&s;ons of great &s;kill in mu&s;ic. Captain Burney, however, and Captain Phillips of the marines, both of whom have &s;ome knowledge of mu&s;ic, are &s;trongly of opinion, that they did &s;ing, in parts; that is, they &s;ung together in different notes.</NOTE> and which they accompany with a gentle
<PB N="312" REF="030274_1142_0FE576FF9D090F48">
motion of their arms, like the inhabitants of the Friendly I&s;lands, have a very plea&s;ing effect.</P>
<P>They are greatly addicted to gambling. One of their games re&s;embles our game of draughts; but, from the number of &s;quares, it &s;eems to be much more intricate. The board is of the length of about two feet, and is divided into two hun|dred and thirty-eight &s;quares, fourteen in a row. In this game they u&s;e black and white pebbles, which they move from one &s;quare to another. Another of their games con&s;i&s;ts in concealing a &s;tone under &s;ome cloth, which is &s;pread out by one of the parties, and rumpled in &s;uch a man|ner, that it is difficult to di&s;tingui&s;h where the &s;tone lies. The antagoni&s;t then &s;trikes, with a &s;tick, that part of the cloth where he &s;uppo&s;es the &s;tone to be: and the chances being, upon the whole, again&s;t his hitting it, odds of all degrees, varying with the opinion of the dexterity of the parties, are laid on the occa&s;ion. Their manner of playing at bowls nearly re&s;embles ours: the bowls have been before de&s;cribed.</P>
<P>They often entertain them&s;elves with races be|tween boys and girls, on which occa&s;ions they lay wagers with great &s;pirit. We &s;aw a man beating his brea&s;t, and tearing his hair, in the violence of rage, for having lo&s;t three hatchets at one of the&s;e races, which he had purcha&s;ed from us with near half his property a very little time before.</P>
<P><PB N="313" REF="030274_1143_0FE576A786850588">Both &s;exes are &s;urpri&s;ingly expert in &s;wimming, which, among the&s;e people, is not only deemed a nece&s;&s;ary art, but is al&s;o a favourite diver&s;ion. One particular method, in which we &s;ometimes &s;aw them amu&s;e them&s;elves with this exerci&s;e, in Karakakooa Bay, de&s;erves to be related. The &s;urf, that breaks on the coa&s;t around this bay, ex|tends about one hundred and fifty yards from the &s;hore; and, within that &s;pace, the &s;urges of the &s;ea are da&s;hed again&s;t the beach with extreme vio|lence. Whenever the impetuo&s;ity of the &s;urf is augmented to its greate&s;t height, they make choice of that time for this amu&s;ement, which they perform in the following manner. About twenty or thirty of the i&s;landers take each a long narrow board, rounded at both ends, and &s;et out from the &s;hore in company with each other. They plunge under the fir&s;t wave they meet, and, after they have &s;uffered it to roll over them, ri&s;e again beyond it, and &s;wim further out into the &s;ea. They encounter the &s;econd wave in the &s;ame manner with the fir&s;t. The principal difficulty con&s;i&s;ts in &s;eizing a favourable opportunity of diving under it; for if a per&s;on mi&s;&s;es the pro|per moment, he is caught by the &s;urf, and forced back with great violence; and his utmo&s;t dex|terity is then required, to prevent his being da&s;hed again&s;t the rocks. When, in con&s;equence of the&s;e repeated efforts, they have gained the &s;mooth water beyond the &s;u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hey recline them&s;elves at
<PB N="314" REF="030274_1144_0FE576CD819FB9C8">
length upon their board, and prepare for their return to &s;hore. As the &s;urf is compo&s;ed of a number of waves, of which every third is ob|&s;erved to be con&s;iderable larger than the re&s;t, and to flow higher upon the &s;hore, while the others break in the intermediate &s;pace; their fir&s;t object is to place them&s;elves on the top of the large&s;t &s;urge, which drives them along with a&s;toni&s;hing rapidity towards the land. If they &s;hould place them&s;elves, by mi&s;take, on one of the &s;maller waves, which breaks before they gain the &s;hore, or &s;hould find them&s;elves unable to keep their board in a proper direction on the upper part of the &s;well, they remain expo&s;ed to the fury of the next; to avoid which, they are under the nece&s;|&s;ity of diving again, and regaining the place whence they &s;et out. Tho&s;e per&s;ons who &s;uc|ceed in their object of reaching the &s;hore, are &s;till in a very hazardous &s;ituation. As the coa&s;t is defended by a chain of rocks, with a &s;mall opening between them in &s;everal places, they are obliged to &s;teer their planks through one of the&s;e openings; or, in ca&s;e of ill &s;ucce&s;s in that re|&s;pect, to quit it before they reach the rocks, and, diving under the wave, make their way back again as well as they are able. This is con&s;i|dered as highly di&s;graceful, and is attended with the lo&s;s of the plank, which we have &s;een da&s;hed to pieces, at the very in&s;tant the native quitted it. The amazing courage and addre&s;s, with
<PB N="315" REF="030274_1145_0FE576A98DED8570">
which they perform the&s;e dangerous manoeuvres, are almo&s;t incredible.</P>
<P>The following accident &s;hews at how early a period they are &s;o far accu&s;tomed to the water, as to lo&s;e all apprehen&s;ions of it, and &s;et its perils at defiance. A canoe, in which was a woman with her children, happening to be over&s;et, one of the children, an infant about four years of age, appeared to be greatly delighted with what had happened, &s;wimming about at its ea&s;e, and playing a number of tricks, till the canoe was brought to its former po&s;ition.</P>
<P>Among the amu&s;ements of the children, we ob&s;erved one that was frequently played at, and which &s;hewed a con&s;iderable &s;hare of dexterity. They take a &s;hort &s;tick, through one extremity of which runs a peg &s;harpened at both ends, ex|tending about an inch on each &s;ide; then throw|ing up a ball formed of green leaves moulded to|gether, and fa&s;tened with twine, they catch it on one of the points of the peg; immediately after which, they throw it up again from the peg, then turn the &s;tick round, and catch the ball on the other point of the peg. Thus, for &s;ome time, they continue catching it on each point of the peg alternately, without mi&s;&s;ing it. They are equally expert at another diver&s;ion of a &s;imilar nature, throwing up in the air, and catching, in their turns, many of the&s;e balls; and we have often &s;een little children thus keep five balls in
<PB N="316" REF="030274_1146_0FE57701A1889840">
motion at once. This latter game is al&s;o prac|ti&s;ed by the young people at the Friendly I&s;les.</P>
<P>The figure and dimen&s;ions of the canoes &s;een by us at Atooi, have been already de&s;cribed. Tho&s;e of the other Sandwich I&s;lands were made exactly in the &s;ame manner; and the large&s;t we &s;aw was a double canoe that belonged to Terreeo|boo, mea&s;uring &s;eventy feet in length, twelve in breadth, and between three and four in depth; and each was hollowed out of one tree.</P>
<P>Their method of agriculture, as well as naviga|tion, re&s;embles that of the other i&s;lands of the Pacific. They have made con&s;iderable proficiency in &s;culpture, and their &s;kill in painting or &s;taining cloth, and in the manufacture of mats, is very great. The mo&s;t curious &s;pecimens of their &s;culp|ture, that we had an opportunity of ob&s;erving, were the wooden bowls, in which the <HI>Erees</HI> drink <HI>ava.</HI> The&s;e are, in general, eight or ten inches in diameter, perfectly round, and extremely well poli&s;hed. They are &s;upported by three or four &s;mall human figures, repre&s;ented in different attitudes. Some of them re&s;t on the &s;houl|ders of their &s;upporters, others on the hands ex|tended over the head; and &s;ome on the head and hands. The figures are very neatly fini&s;hed, and accurately proportioned; and even the anatomy of the mu&s;cles is well expre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>They manufacture their cloth in the &s;ame man|ner, and of the &s;ame materials, as at the Society
<PB N="317" REF="030274_1147_0FE5771427FAE8B8">
and Friendly I&s;les. That which they intend to paint, is of a &s;trong and thick texture, &s;everal folds being beaten and incorporated together; after which they cut it in breadths, two or three feet wide, and then paint it in a great variety of patterns, with &s;uch regularity and comprehen&s;ive|ne&s;s of de&s;ign, as &s;hew an extraordinary portion of ta&s;te and fancy. The exactne&s;s with which even the mo&s;t intricate patterns are continued, is really a&s;toni&s;hing, as they have no &s;tamps, and as the whole is performed by the eye, with a piece of bamboo cane dipped in paint; the hand being &s;upported by another piece of the &s;ame &s;ort of cane. They extract their colours from the &s;ame berries, and other vegetable articles, which are made u&s;e of at Otaheite for this pur|po&s;e.</P>
<P>The operation of &s;taining or painting their cloth, is confined to the females, and is deno|minated <HI>kipparee.</HI> It is remarkable, that they always called our writing by this name. The young women would frequently take the pen from our hands, and &s;hew us, that they were as well acquainted with the u&s;e of it as we our&s;elves were; telling us, at the &s;ame time, that our pens were inferior to theirs. They con&s;idered a ma|nu&s;cript &s;heet of paper, as a piece of cloth &s;tri|ped after the mode of our country; and it was with the greate&s;t difficulty that we could make
<PB N="318" REF="030274_1148_0FE576D6868C77C8">
them under&s;tand, that our figures contained a meaning in them which theirs were de&s;titute of.</P>
<P>They make their mats of the leaves of the <HI>pan|danus;</HI> and the&s;e, as well as their cloths, are beautifully worked in various patterns, and &s;tain|ed with various colours. Some of them have a ground of a &s;traw colour, embelli&s;hed with green &s;pots; others are of a pale green, &s;potted with &s;quares, or rhomboids, of red; and &s;ome are ornamented with elegant &s;tripes, either in &s;traight or waving lines of brown and red. In this branch of manufacture, whether we regard the finene&s;s, beauty, or &s;trength, the&s;e i&s;landers may be &s;aid to excel the whole world.</P>
<P>Their fi&s;hing-hooks are of various &s;izes and figures; but tho&s;e which are principally made u&s;e of, are about two or three inches in length, and are formed in the &s;hape of a &s;mall fi&s;h, &s;erving as a bait, with a bunch of feathers fa&s;tened to the head or tail. They make their hooks of bone, mother-of-pearl, or wood, pointed and barbed with little bones or tortoi&s;e-&s;hells. Tho&s;e with which they fi&s;h for &s;harks, are very large, being, in general, of the length of &s;ix or eight inches. Con&s;idering the materials of which the&s;e hooks are compo&s;ed, their neatne&s;s and &s;trength are amazing; and, indeed, upon trial, we found them &s;uperior to our own.</P>
<P>Of the bark of the <HI>touta,</HI> or cloth-tree, neatly twi&s;ted, they form the line which they u&s;e for
<PB N="319" REF="030274_1149_0FE577051C1B09B0">
fi&s;hing, for making nets, and for &s;ome other pur|po&s;es. It is of different degrees of finene&s;s, and may be continued to any length. They have al&s;o a finer &s;ort, which they make of the bark of a &s;hrub, named <HI>areemah;</HI> and the fine&s;t is com|po&s;ed of human hair: this la&s;t, however, is chiefly made u&s;e of for matters of ornament.</P>
<P>They likewi&s;e make cordage of a &s;tronger kind, from cocoa-nut fibres for the rigging of their ca|noes. Some of this, which was purcha&s;ed by us for our own u&s;e, was found to be well calculated for the &s;maller kinds of running rigging. They al&s;o manufacture another &s;ort of cordage, which is flat, and extremely &s;trong, and is principally u&s;ed for the purpo&s;e of la&s;hing the roofs of their hou&s;es. This la&s;t is not twi&s;ted after the manner of the former &s;orts, but is formed of the fibrous &s;trings of the coat of the cocoa-nut, plaited with the fingers, in the &s;ame mode which is practi&s;ed by our &s;eamen in making their points for the reefing of &s;ails.</P>
<P>They apply their gourds to various dome&s;tic purpo&s;es. The&s;e grow to &s;uch an enormous mag|nitude, that &s;ome of them will contain from ten to a dozen gallons. In order to adapt them the better to their re&s;pective u&s;es, they take care to give them different &s;hapes, by fa&s;tening ban|dages round them during their growth. Thus, &s;ome of them are in the form of a di&s;h, &s;erving to hold their puddings, vegetables, &s;alted pro|vi&s;ions,
<PB N="320" REF="030274_1150_0FE576F7AA805B18">
&s;alt, &amp;c. Others are of a long cylin|drical form, and &s;erve to contain their fi&s;hing-tackle, which two &s;orts are furni&s;hed with neat clo&s;e covers, made al&s;o of the gourd. Others are in the &s;hape of a long-necked bottle; and, in the&s;e, water is kept. They frequently &s;core them with a heated in&s;trument, &s;o as to commu|nicate to them the appearance of being painted, in a great variety of elegant de&s;igns.</P>
<P>Their pans, in which they make &s;alt, are made of earth, lined with clay; and are in general, &s;ix or eight feet &s;quare, and about two-thirds of a foot in depth. They are elevated on a bank of &s;tones near the high-water mark, whence the &s;alt water is conducted to the bottom of them, in trenches out of which they are all filled; and, in a &s;hort time, the &s;un performs the proce&s;s of evaporation. The &s;alt we met with at Oneeheow and Atooi, during our fir&s;t vi&s;it, was browni&s;h and rather dirty; but that which we afterwards procured at Karakakooa Bay, was white, and of an excellent quality; and we obtained an ample &s;upply of it, in&s;omuch that, be&s;ides the quantity u&s;ed by us in &s;alting pork, we filled all our empty ca&s;ks with it.</P>
<P>The warlike weapons of the&s;e people are dag|gers, which they call by the name <HI>pahooa;</HI> &s;pears, &s;lings, and clubs. The <HI>pahooa</HI> is made of a black heavy wood, that re&s;embles ebony. It is com|monly from one to two feet in length; and has
<PB N="321" REF="030274_1151_0FE576B0D001E680">
a &s;tring pa&s;&s;ing through the handle, by which it is &s;u&s;pended to the arm. The blade is &s;omewhat rounded in the middle; the &s;ides are &s;harp, and terminate in a point. This in&s;trument is intended for clo&s;e engagements; and, in the hands of the natives, is a very de&s;tructive one.</P>
<P>Their &s;pears are of two kinds, and are formed of a hard wood, which, in its appearace, is not un|like mahogany. One &s;ort is from &s;ix to eight feet in length, well poli&s;hed, and increa&s;ing gradually in thickne&s;s from the extremity till within the di&s;tance of &s;ix or &s;even inches from the point, which tapers &s;uddenly, and has five or &s;ix rows of barbs. It is probable, that the&s;e are u&s;ed in the way of javelins. The other &s;ort, with which the warriors we &s;aw at Atooi and Owhyhee were chiefly armed, are from twelve to fifteen feet in length; and, in&s;tead of being barbed, terminate towards the point in the manner of their daggers.</P>
<P>Their &s;lings are the &s;ame with our common &s;lings, except in this re&s;pect, that the &s;tone is lodging on matting in&s;tead of leather. Their clubs are formed indifferently of &s;everal kinds of wood: they are of various &s;izes and &s;hapes, and of rude workman&s;hip.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>IN the Sandwich I&s;lands, the inhabitants are di|vided into three cla&s;&s;es. The <HI>Erees,</HI> or chiefs of each di&s;trict, are the fir&s;t; and one of the&s;e is &s;uperior to the re&s;t, who is called, at Owhyhee, <HI>Eree-taboo,</HI> and <HI>Eree Moee;</HI> the fir&s;t name ex|pre&s;&s;ing his authority, and the latter &s;ignifying that, in his pre&s;ence, all mu&s;t pro&s;trate them|&s;elves. Tho&s;e of the &s;econd cla&s;s appear to enjoy a right of property, but have no authority. Tho&s;e who compo&s;e the third cla&s;s, are called
<PB N="323" REF="030274_1153_0FE576DFC67AC488">
<HI>towtows,</HI> or &s;ervants, and have not either rank or property.</P>
<P>The &s;uperior power and di&s;tinction of Ter|reeoboo, the Eree-taboo of Owhyhee, was &s;uffi|ciently evident from his reception at Karakakooa, on his fir&s;t arrival. The inhabitants all pro&s;|trated them&s;elves at the entrance of their hou&s;es; and the canoes were <HI>tabooed,</HI> till he di&s;charged the interdict. He was then ju&s;t returned from Mowee, an i&s;land he was contending for, in be|half of his &s;on Tewarro, who&s;e wife was the only child of the king of that place, again&s;t Tahee|terree, his &s;urviving brother. In this expedi|tion, he was attended by many of his warriors; but we could never learn whether they &s;erved him as volunteers, or whether they held their rank and property by that tenure.</P>
<P>That the &s;ubordinate chiefs are tributary to him, is evidently proved in the in&s;tance of Kaoo, which has been already related. It has al&s;o been ob&s;erved, that the two mo&s;t powerful chiefs of the Sandwich I&s;lands, are Terreeoboo, and Per|reeoranne; the former being chief of Owhyhee, and the latter of Woahoo; all the &s;maller i&s;les being governed by one of the&s;e &s;overeigns; Mowee was at this time, claimed by Terreeoboo, for his &s;on and intended &s;ucce&s;&s;or; Atooi and Oneehow being in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the grand&s;ons of Perreeorannee.</P>
<P><PB N="324" REF="030274_1154_0FE576030FBD8698">Without entering into the genealogy of the kings of Owhyhee and Mowee, it may be nece&s;&s;ary to mention, that when we were fir&s;t off Mowee, Terreeoboo and his warriors were there to &s;upport the claims made by his wife, his &s;on, and his daughter-in-law; and a battle had then been fought with the oppo&s;ite party, in which Terreeoboo had been victorious. Matters, however, were after|wards compromi&s;ed; Taheeterree was to have po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of the three neighbouring i&s;lands, during his life; Teewarro to be acknowledged the Chief of Mowee, and to &s;ucceed to Owhyhee, on the death of Terreeoboo; together with the three i&s;lands con|tiguous to Mowee, after the decea&s;e of Taheeterre. If Teewarro, who has lately married his half &s;i&s;ter, &s;hould die, and leave no i&s;&s;ue behind him, tho&s;e i&s;lands de&s;cend to Maiha-maiha, whom we have frequently mentioned, he being the &s;on of Terreeoboo's decea&s;ed brother: and &s;hould he die without i&s;&s;ue it is doubtful who would be the &s;ucce&s;&s;or, for Terreeoboo's two younge&s;t &s;ons, being born of a mother who had no rank, would be debarred all right of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. We did not &s;ee Queen Rora-rora, whom Terreeoboo had left at Mowee; but we had an opportunity of &s;eeing Kanee Kaberaia, the mother of the two youths of whom he was &s;o extremely fond.</P>
<P>From what has been already mentioned, it appears pretty clearly that their government is
<PB N="325" REF="030274_1155_0FE576BDA4463588">
hereditary; whence it appears probable, that the inferior titles as well as property, de&s;cend in the &s;ame cour&s;e. Re&s;pecting Perreorannee, we only di&s;covered that he is an <HI>Eree-taboo;</HI> that he was, on &s;ome pretence, invading the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Ta|heeterree, and that the i&s;lands to leeward were go|verned by his grand&s;ons.</P>
<P>The <HI>Erees</HI> appear to have unlimited power over the inferior cla&s;&s;es of people; many in&s;tances of which occurred daily whil&s;t we continued among them. On the other hand, the people are implicit|ly obedient. It is remarkable, however, that we never &s;aw the chiefs exerci&s;e any acts of cruelty, inju&s;tice, or in&s;olence towards them; though they put in practice their power over each other, in a mo&s;t tyrannical degree: which is fully proved by the two following in&s;tances.</P>
<P>One of the lower order of chiefs, having &s;hewn great civility to the ma&s;ter of the &s;hip, on his examination of Karakakooa Bay; Mr. King, &s;ome time afterwards, took him on board the Re&s;olu|tion, and introduced him to Captain Cook, who engaged him to dine with us. While we remain|ed at table, Pareea entered, who&s;e countenance manife&s;ted the highe&s;t indignation at &s;eeing our gue&s;t &s;o honourably entertained. He &s;eized him by the hair of the head, and would have dragged him out of the cabin, if the Captain had not interfered. After much altercation, we could obtain no other indulgence (without quarrelling
<PB N="326" REF="030274_1156_0FE5771740CA31B8">
with Pareea) than that our gue&s;t &s;hould be per|mitted to remain in the cabin, on condition that he &s;eated him&s;elf on the floor, while Pareea occu|pied his place at the table. An in&s;tance &s;ome|what &s;imilar, happened when Terreeoboo came fir&s;t on board the Re&s;olution; when Maiha-maiha, who attended him, &s;eeing Pareea upon deck, turn|ed him mo&s;t ignominiou&s;ly out of the &s;hip; even though we knew Pareea to be a man of the fir&s;t con&s;equence.</P>
<P>Whether the lower cla&s;s have their property &s;e|cured, from the rapacity of the great chiefs, we cannot certainly &s;ay, but it appears to be well pro|tected again&s;t theft and depredation. All their plantations, their hou&s;es, their hogs, and their cloth, are left unguarded, without fear or appre|hen&s;ion. In the plain country, they &s;eparate their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions by walls; and, in the woods where hor&s;e plantains grow, they u&s;e white flags to di&s;|criminate property, in the &s;ame manner as they do bunches of leaves at Otaheite. The&s;e circum|&s;tances &s;trongly indicate, that, where property is concerned, the power of the chiefs is not arbitra|ry; but &s;o far limited, as to afford encouragement to the inferior orders to cultivate the &s;oil, which they occupy di&s;tinct from each other.</P>
<P>The information we could obtain, re&s;pecting their admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice, is exceedingly im|perfect. If a quarrel aro&s;e among the lower cla&s;s of people, the matter was referred to the
<PB N="327" REF="030274_1157_0FE576B43A49A950">
deci&s;ion of &s;ome chief. If an inferior chief had offended one of &s;uperior rank, his puni&s;hment was dictated by the feelings of the &s;uperior at that moment. If he &s;hould fortunately e&s;cape the fir&s;t tran&s;ports of his rage, he, perhaps, found means, through the mediation of others, to com|pound for his offence, by all, or a part of his effects.</P>
<P>Their religion re&s;embles that of the Society and Friendly I&s;lands. In common with each other, they have all their <HI>Morais,</HI> their <HI>Whattas</HI> their &s;acred &s;ongs, and their &s;acrifices. The&s;e are convincing proofs that their religious opinions are derived from the &s;ame &s;ource. The ceremo|nies here are, indeed, longer and more numerous than in the i&s;lands above-mentioned. And though in all the&s;e places, the care and performance of their religious rights, is committed to a particular cla&s;s of people; yet we have never found a regular &s;ociety of prie&s;ts, till we arrived at Kakooa, in Karakakooa Bay. <HI>Orono</HI> was the title given to the principal of this order; a title which &s;eemed to imply &s;omething highly &s;acred, and which almo&s;t received adoration in the per&s;on of Omeeah. The privilege of holding the principal offices in this order, is doubtle&s;s limited to certain families. Omeeah, the <HI>Orono,</HI> was Kaoo's &s;on, and Kairee|keea's nephew. Kaireekeea pre&s;ided in all reli|gious ceremonies at the <HI>morai,</HI> in the ab&s;ence of his grandfather. It was ob&s;erved, likewi&s;e, that
<PB N="328" REF="030274_1158_0FE57724352F5370">
the &s;on of Omeeah, an infant of about the age of five years, had always a number of attendants, and &s;uch other marks of attention and e&s;teem were &s;hewn him, as we never ob&s;erved in any &s;imilar in&s;tance. Hence we concluded, that his life was an object of much con&s;equence, and that he would eventually &s;ucceed to the high dignity of his father.</P>
<P>The title of <HI>Orono,</HI> we have already ob&s;erved, was be&s;towed upon Captain Cook; and it is very certain that they con&s;idered us as a race of be|ings &s;uperior to them&s;elves; frequently repeating, that great <HI>Eatooa</HI> lived in our country. The fa|vourite little idol (which has been already de|&s;cribed) on the <HI>morai,</HI> in Karakakooa Bay, is called <HI>Koonoorackaiee,</HI> and is &s;aid to be Terreoboo's god, who al&s;o re&s;ided among&s;t us.</P>
<P>Infinite variety of the&s;e images were to be &s;een, both on the <HI>morai,</HI> and about their hou&s;es, on which they be&s;tow different names; but they cer|tainly were held in very little e&s;timation, from their contemptuous expre&s;&s;ions of them, and from their expo&s;ing them to &s;ale for trifles; though they generally had one particular figure in high favour, to which, whil&s;t it continued a favourite, all their adoration was addre&s;&s;ed. They arrayed it in red cloth, beat their drums, and &s;ang hymns before it; placed bunches of red feathers, and different vegetables at its feet; and frequently
<PB N="329" REF="030274_1159_0FE576922C791220">
expo&s;ed a pig, or a dog, to rot on the <HI>Whatta,</HI> near which it was placed.</P>
<P>A party of us were conducted to a large hou&s;e, in a bay to the &s;outhward of Karakakooa, in which we beheld the black figure of a man, re&s;t|ing on his toes and fingers, and his head was inclined backwards; the limbs were well pro|portioned, and the whole was beautifully poli&s;hed. This figure was called <HI>Maee;</HI> round which thir|teen others were placed, with &s;hapes rude and di&s;torted. The&s;e, we were told, were the Eatooas of decea&s;ed chiefs, who&s;e names they repeated. Plenty of <HI>Whattas</HI> were &s;een within the place, with the remains of offerings on many of them. They al&s;o admit into their hou&s;es, many ludicrous and ob&s;cene idols, not unlike the Priapus of the ancients.</P>
<P>Former voyagers have remarked, that the So|ciety and Friendly I&s;landers, pay adoration to particular birds; and it &s;eems to be a cu&s;tom that is prevalent in the&s;e i&s;lands. Ravens are perhaps the object of it here; for Mr. King &s;aw two of the&s;e birds perfectly tame, at the village of Kakooa, and was told they were <HI>Eatooas;</HI> he offered &s;everal articles for them, which were all refu&s;ed; and he was particularly cautioned not to hurt or offend them.</P>
<P>The prayers and offerings, made by the prie&s;ts before their meals, may be cla&s;&s;ed among their religious ceremonies. As they always drink <HI>ava</HI>
<PB N="330" REF="030274_1160_0FE5770B38C87BD8">
before they begin their repa&s;t, whil&s;t that is chewing, the &s;uperior in rank begins a &s;ort of hymn, in which he is &s;oon after joined by one or more of the company; the bodies of the others are put in motion, and their hands are gently clapped together in concert with the &s;ingers. The <HI>ava</HI> being ready, cups of it are pre&s;ented to tho&s;e who do not join in the hymn, which are held in their hands till it is concluded; when, with united voice, they make a loud re&s;pon&s;e, and drink their <HI>ava.</HI> The performers are then &s;erved with &s;ome of it which they drink, after the &s;ame ceremony has been repeated. And, if any per&s;on of a very &s;uperior rank &s;hould be pre|&s;ent, a cup is pre&s;ented to him la&s;t of all. After chanting for a &s;hort time, and hearing a re&s;pon&s;ive chant from the others, he pours a &s;mall quantity on the ground, and drinks the re&s;t. A piece of the fle&s;h, which has been dre&s;&s;ed, is then cut off, and, together with &s;ome of the vegetables, is placed at the foot of the figure of the Eatooa; and after another hymn has been chanted, they begin their meal. A ceremony, in many re|&s;pects re&s;embling this, is al&s;o performed by the chiefs, when they drink <HI>ava</HI> between their regu|lar meals.</P>
<P>According to the accounts given by the na|tives, human &s;acrifices are more common here, than in any of the i&s;lands we have vi&s;ited. They have recour&s;e to the&s;e horrid rites on the com|mencement
<PB N="331" REF="030274_1161_0FE57636EAA1D180">
of a war and previous to every great battle, or other &s;ignal enterprize. The death of a chief demands a &s;acrifice of one or more <HI>tow|tows,</HI> according to the rank he bears; and we were informed that no le&s;s than ten were doomed to &s;uffer, on the death of Terreeoboo. This practice, however, is the le&s;s horrible, as the un|happy victims are totally unacquainted with their fate. Tho&s;e who are de&s;tined to fall, are attack|ed with large clubs, wherever they may happen to be; and after they are dead, are conveyed to the place where the &s;ub&s;equent rites are to be per|formed. This brings to our remembrance the &s;kulls of tho&s;e who had been &s;acrificed on the decea&s;e of &s;ome principal chief, and were fixed to the <HI>morai</HI> at Kakooa. At the village of Kow|rowa, we received further information upon this &s;ubject; where we were &s;hewn a &s;mall piece of ground, within a &s;tone fence, which we were told was an <HI>Heree-eere,</HI> or burying place of a chief. The per&s;on who gave us this information, point|ing to one of the corners added,&mdash;and there lie the <HI>tangata</HI> and <HI>waheene-taboo,</HI> or the man and woman who became &s;acrifices at his funeral.</P>
<P>The knocking out their fore-teeth may be, with propriety, cla&s;&s;ed among their religious cu&s;toms. Mo&s;t of the common people, and many of the chiefs, had lo&s;t one or more of them; and this we under&s;tood was con&s;idered as a pro|pitiatory &s;acrifice to the Eatooa, to avert his
<PB N="332" REF="030274_1162_0FE576FAB5AF5CC8">
anger; and not like the cutting off a part of the finger at the Friendly I&s;lands, to expre&s;s the vio|lence of their grief at the decea&s;e of a friend.</P>
<P>Of their opinions, with re&s;pect to a future &s;tate, we had very defective information. On enquiring of them, whither the dead were gone? We were told that the breath, which they &s;eemed to con&s;ider as the immortal part, was fled to the <HI>Eatooa.</HI> They &s;eemed al&s;o to give a de&s;cription of &s;ome place, which they &s;uppo&s;e to be the abode of the dead; but we could not learn that they had any idea of rewards or puni&s;hments.</P>
<P>An explanation of the word <HI>taboo,</HI> may not, in this place, be improperly introduced. On a&s;k|ing the rea&s;on of the intercour&s;e being in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">erdicted, between us and the I&s;landers, the day preceding Terreeoboo's arrival, we were informed, that the bay was <HI>tabooed.</HI> The &s;ame interdiction took place, by our de&s;ire, when we interred the remains of Captain Cook. The mo&s;t implicit obedience, in the&s;e two in&s;tances, was rendered by the natives; but whether on religious principles, or in deference to civil authority, we cannot pretend to determine.</P>
<P>The ground on which our ob&s;ervatories were fixed, and the place where our ma&s;ts were depo|&s;ited, were <HI>tabooed,</HI> and the operation was equally efficacious. This con&s;ecration was performed only by the prie&s;ts; and yet, at our reque&s;t, the men ventured on the &s;pot which was <HI>tabooed;</HI>
<PB N="333" REF="030274_1163_0FE57685BB263258">
whence it &s;hould &s;eem they entertained no reli|gious apprehen&s;ions, their obedience being limit|ed merely to our refu&s;al. No inducements could bring the women near us; on account, it is pre|&s;umed, of the <HI>morai</HI> adjoining; which they are, at all times, prohibited from approaching; not only here, but in all the i&s;lands of the&s;e &s;eas.</P>
<P>Women, it has been ob&s;erved, are always <HI>ta|booed,</HI> or forbidden to eat certain articles of food. We have &s;een many of them, at their meals, have their meat put into their mouths by others; and, on our reque&s;ting to know the rea&s;on of it, we were informed, that they were <HI>tabooed,</HI> and not permitted to feed them&s;elves. This prohi|bition was always the con&s;equence of a&s;&s;i&s;ting at any funeral, touching a dead body, and many other occa&s;ions. The word <HI>taboo</HI> is indifferently applied, either to per&s;ons or things; as, the na|tives are <HI>tabooed,</HI> the bay is <HI>tabooed,</HI> &amp;c. This word is al&s;o expre&s;&s;ive of any thing &s;acred, de|voted or eminent. The king of Owhyhee was called <HI>Eree-taboo,</HI> and a human victim, <HI>tangata taboo:</HI> and, among the Friendly I&s;landers, Tonga, where the king re&s;ides, is called <HI>Tongataboo.</HI></P>
<P>Very little can be &s;aid re&s;pecting their mar|riages, except that &s;uch a compact &s;eems to exi&s;t among them. It has already been mentioned, that, when Terreeoboo had left his queen Rora-rora at Mowee, another woman cohabited with him, by whom he had children, and &s;eemed par|ticularly
<PB N="334" REF="030274_1164_0FE576E96ADF6EF0">
attached to her; but, whether poly|gamy is allowed, or whether it is mixed with concubinage, either among the principal or in|ferior orders, we &s;aw too little of, to warrant any conclu&s;ions. From what we &s;aw of the dome&s;tic concerns of the lower cla&s;s of people, one man and one woman &s;eemed to have the direction of the hou&s;e, and the children were &s;ubordinate to them, as in civilized countries.</P>
<P>The following is the only in&s;tance of any thing like jealou&s;y, which we have &s;een among them; and which &s;hews, that among married women of rand not only fidelity, but even a degree of re&s;erve is required.</P>
<P>At one of their boxing matches, Omeah ro&s;e two or three times from his place, and approach|ed his wife with &s;trong marks of di&s;plea&s;ure, commanding her, as we &s;uppo&s;ed, to withdraw. Whether he thought her beauty engaged too much of our attention, or whatever might be his motives, there certainly exi&s;ted no real cau&s;e of jealou&s;y. She, however, continued in her place, and, at the conclu&s;ion of the entertainment, join|ed our party; and even &s;olicited &s;ome trifling pre&s;ents. She was informed that we had not any about us; but that, if &s;he would accompany us to the tent, &s;he &s;hould be welcome to make a choice of what &s;he liked. She was accordingly, proceeding with us; which being ob&s;erved by Omeah, he followed in great rage, &s;eized her
<PB N="335" REF="030274_1165_0FE5769E715C9CA8">
by the hair, and, with his fi&s;ts, began to inflict &s;evere corporal puni&s;hment. Having been the innocent cau&s;e of this extraordinary treatment, we were exceedingly concerned at it; though we under&s;tood it would be highly improper for us to interfere, between hu&s;band and wife of &s;uch &s;u|perior rank. The natives, however, at length, interpo&s;ed; and the next day, we had the &s;atis|faction of meeting them together, perfectly &s;a|tisfied with each other; and, what was extremely &s;ingular, the lady would not permit us to rally the hu&s;band on his behaviour; which we had an in|clination to do; plainly telling us, that he had acted very properly.</P>
<P>At Karakakooa Bay, we had twice an oppor|tunity of &s;eeing a part of their funeral rites. Hearing of the death of an old chief, not far from our ob&s;ervatories, &s;ome of us repaired to the place, where we beheld a number of people a&s;&s;embled. They were &s;eated round an area, fronting the hou&s;e where the decea&s;ed lay; and a man, having on a red feathered cap, came to the door, con&s;tantly putting out his head, and making a mo&s;t lamentable howl, accompanied with horrid grimaces, and violent di&s;tortions of the face. A large mat was afterwards &s;pread upon the area, and thirteen women and two men, who came out of the hou&s;e, &s;at down upon it in three equal rows; three of the women, and the two men, being in front. The women had feathered
<PB N="336" REF="030274_1166_0FE5767B439CD9B8">
ruffs on their necks and hands; and their &s;hould|ers were decorated with broad green leaves, cu|riou&s;ly &s;colloped. Near a &s;mall hut, at one cor|ner of this area, half a dozen boys were placed, waving &s;mall white banners, and <HI>taboo</HI> &s;ticks, who would not &s;uffer us to approach them. Hence we imagined, that the dead body was depo&s;ited in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ut, but we were afterwards informed that it remained in the hou&s;e, where the tricks were playing at the door, by the manin the red cap. The company, &s;eated on the mat, &s;ung a melan|choly tune, accompanied with a gentle motion of the arms and body. This having continued &s;ome time, they put them&s;elves in a po&s;ture between kneeling and &s;itting, and their arms and bodies into a mo&s;t rapid motion, keeping pace at the &s;ame time with the mu&s;ic. The&s;e la&s;t exertions being too violent to continue, at intervals they had &s;lower motions. An hour having pa&s;&s;ed in the&s;e ceremonies, more mats were &s;pread upon the area, when the dead chief's widow, and three or four other elderly women, came out of the hou&s;e with &s;low and &s;olemn pace; and &s;eated them&s;elves before the compa|ny, began to wail mo&s;t bitterly, in which they were joined by the three rows of women behind them; the two men appearing melancholy and pen&s;ive. They continued thus, with little varia|tion, till late in the evening, when we left them; and, at day-light in the morning, the people
<PB N="337" REF="030274_1167_0FE5760E65501FC0">
were di&s;per&s;ed, and every thing appeared per|fectly quiet. We were then given to under&s;tand, that the body was removed; but we could not learn how it was di&s;po&s;ed of. While we were directing our enquiries to this object, we were approached by three women of rank, who &s;igni|fied to us, that our pre&s;ence interrupted the per|formance of &s;ome nece&s;&s;ary rites. Soon after we had left them, we heard their cries and lamenta|tions; and when we met them a few hours after|wards, the lower part of their faces were painted perfectly black.</P>
<P>We had al&s;o an opportunity of ob&s;erving the ceremonies on the funeral of one of the ordinary cla&s;s. Hearing &s;ome mournful cries, i&s;&s;uing from a mi&s;erable hut, we entered it, and di&s;co|vered two women, which we &s;uppo&s;ed to be mo|ther and daughter, weeping over the body of a man who had that moment expired. They fir&s;t covered the body with a cloth; then, lying down by it, they &s;pread the cloth over them&s;elves, be|ginning a melancholy kind of &s;ong, often repeat|ing, <HI>Aweb medoaah! Aweb tanee!</HI> O my father! Oh my hu&s;band! In one corner of the hou&s;e, a young daughter lay pro&s;trate on the ground, having &s;ome black cloth &s;pread over her, and re|peating the &s;ame expre&s;&s;ions. On our quitting this melancholy &s;cene, we found many of their neighbours, collected together at the door, who were all perfectly &s;ilent, and attentive to their
<PB N="338" REF="030274_1168_0FE57728746807E8">
lamentations. Mr. King was willing to have em|braced this opportunity of knowing in what man|ner the body would be di&s;po&s;ed of; and there|fore, after being convinced that it was not re|moved when he went to bed, he ordered the &s;entries to walk before the hou&s;e, and if there were any appearances of removing the body, to acquaint him with it. The &s;entries, however, were remi&s;s in the performance of their duty, for, before the morning, the body was taken away. On a&s;king how it had been di&s;po&s;ed of, they pointed towards the &s;ea, perhaps thereby indicating, that it had been depo&s;ited in the deep, or that it had been conveyed to &s;ome burying-ground beyond the bay. The place of inter|ment for the chiefs, is the <HI>morai,</HI> or <HI>heree erees,</HI> and tho&s;e who are &s;acrificed on the occa&s;ion, are buried by the &s;ide of them. The <HI>morai</HI> in which the chief was interred, who, after making a &s;pi|rited re&s;i&s;tance, was killed in the cave, has a hanging of red cloth round it.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>WE weighed anchor on the 15th of March, at &s;even o'clock in the morning, and &s;tood to the &s;outh-we&s;t, in expectation of falling
<PB N="340" REF="030274_1170_0FE576EAF0843638">
in with the i&s;land of Modoopapappa; the native<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> having a&s;&s;ured us that it lay in that direction, within five hours &s;ail of Tahoora. About four in the afternoon, a large canoe overtook us, in which were ten per&s;ons, who were inhabitants of Oneeheow, and were proceeding to Tahoora to catch birds; particularly tropic and man-of-war birds, which are &s;aid to be very numerous in that place. It has already been ob&s;erved, that the feathers of the&s;e birds are held in great e&s;teem, being principally u&s;ed in the ornamental part of their dre&s;s.</P>
<P>Not having &s;een the i&s;land at eight in the even|ing, we hauled to the northward till midnight, when we tacked and &s;tood to the &s;outh-ea&s;t till day-break the next morning; when Tahoora bore ea&s;t-north-ea&s;t, di&s;tant about five or &s;ix leagues. We then &s;teered we&s;t-&s;outhwe&s;t, mak|ing a &s;ignal for the Di&s;covery to &s;pread four miles upon our &s;tarboard beam. We &s;tood on till five, and then made a &s;ignal for the Di&s;covery to come under our &s;tern, having given over all hopes of &s;eeing Modoopapappa. We &s;uppo&s;ed it might lie more &s;outherly from Tahoora, than the direc|tion which we had taken; though it is very po&s;&s;ible that we might have pa&s;&s;ed it in the night, it having been de&s;cribed to us as a very &s;mall i&s;land, and almo&s;t even with the &s;ea.</P>
<P>On the 17th, we &s;teered we&s;t, Captain Clerke meaning to keep nearly in the &s;ame parallel of
<PB N="341" REF="030274_1171_0FE5768D18F0B460">
latitude, till we made the longitude of Awat&s;ka Bay; and then to &s;teer north for the harbour of St. Peter and St. Paul, which was al&s;o fixed on as our rendezvous, if we &s;hould happen to &s;epa|rate. This track was cho&s;en, becau&s;e we &s;up|po&s;ed it to be yet unexplored, and we might pro|bably meet with &s;ome new i&s;lands in our pa&s;&s;age.</P>
<P>From the time of our lo&s;ing &s;ight of Tahoora, till the afternoon of the 18th, we had hardly &s;een a bird: we then &s;aw &s;everal boobies, and man-of-war birds, which induced us to look out &s;harply for land. The wind le&s;&s;ened towards the even|ing; and the heavy &s;well, which made the &s;hips labour exceedingly on the 16th and 17th, was con&s;iderably abated. No land appeared the next day; and at noon we &s;teered we&s;t by &s;outh, in expectation of finding the trade winds (which ge|nerally blew from the ea&s;t by north) fre&s;her as we advanced. It is remarkable, that, though no birds appeared in the forenoon, we had a multi|tude of boobies and man-of-war birds about us in the evening; whence we &s;uppo&s;ed that we had pa&s;&s;ed the land, not far di&s;tant from where the former flights appeared, and where approach|ing &s;ome other i&s;land.</P>
<P>We had fine weather and a moderate wind, till the 23d, when it increa&s;ed to a &s;trong gale, and continued about twelve hours. Afterwards it became more moderate, and remained &s;o till
<PB N="342" REF="030274_1172_0FE57709054A08D0">
noon on the 25th; at which time we had only a very light air.</P>
<P>In the morning of the 26th, we imagined we &s;aw land to the we&s;t-&s;outh-we&s;t; but we di&s;co|vered our mi&s;take, after &s;ailing &s;ixteen leagues in that direction; and, night approaching, we again &s;teered we&s;t. We pur&s;ued this cour&s;e, with|out much alteration in the wind, till the 29th, when it &s;hifted about, and was in the we&s;t for a few hours in the night; the weather being cloudy, accompanied with a great deal of rain. For &s;ome days pa&s;t, we had met with &s;everal turtles, one of which was &s;o remarkably &s;mall, as not to exceed three inches in length. We were again vi&s;ited by man-of-war birds and an uncommon kind of boobies. They were entirely white, except a black &s;pot at the tip of each wing, and had a &s;trong re&s;emblance of gannets, at fir&s;t &s;ight.</P>
<P>The continuation of the light winds, with the very un&s;ettled &s;tate of the weather, and the little expectation we had of any change for the better, induced Captain Clerke to give up his plan of keeping within the tropical latitudes. In con&s;e|quence of which, we began, at &s;ix o'clock this evening, to &s;teer north-we&s;t by north. The light winds almo&s;t con&s;tantly prevailed, after our de|parture from the Sandwich I&s;lands; during which time the air was hot and &s;ultry; the thermome|ter being generally from 80&deg; to 83&deg;. We had
<PB N="343" REF="030274_1173_0FE57694127E5060">
al&s;o a con&s;iderable &s;well from the north-ea&s;t, in which the &s;hips were &s;trained exceedingly.</P>
<P>On the fir&s;t of April, in the morning, the wind changed to the north-ea&s;t by ea&s;t, and continued to blow a fre&s;h breeze till the 4th, in the morn|ing, when it altered two points. At noon it blew a &s;trong gale, which continued till the 5th, in the afternoon. It then changed its direction to the &s;outh-ea&s;t, and blew moderate, with much rain. We kept &s;teering, all this time, to the north-we&s;t, again&s;t a &s;low current from that quarter. On the 4th, when our latitude was 26&deg; 17&prime;, and our longitude 173&deg; 30&prime;, we &s;aw great numbers of what are called (by the &s;ailors) Por|tugue&s;e men-of-war, <HI>holothuria phy&s;alis.</HI> Va&s;t quantities of oceanic birds likewi&s;e attended us, among which we di&s;covered the &s;heer-water and albatro&s;s.</P>
<P>About noon on the 6th, we lo&s;t the trade-wind. We were then in the latitude of 29&deg; 50&prime;, and the longitude of 170&deg; 1&prime;. Our old running ropes having been continually breaking in the late gales; we reeved all the new ones we had left, and made other nece&s;&s;ary preparations for the different climate we were &s;hortly to encounter. The fine weather which we experienced between the tro|pics, had not been mi&s;employed. The carpenters were &s;ufficiently engaged in repairing the boats. Our be&s;t bower cable having received &s;o much injury in Karakakooa Bay, and off Oneheow, as
<PB N="344" REF="030274_1174_0FE5767CCA0CEBF8">
to occa&s;ion forty fathoms to be cut from it; we converted that, together with &s;ome other old cordage into &s;pun-yarn, and applied it to various purpo&s;es. By which means, many of our people were kept wholly employed by the boat&s;wain. Be&s;ides, it was now become a trouble&s;ome and laborious part of our duty, to air the &s;ails, &amp;c. which were continually growing wet, from the leakne&s;s of the &s;ides and deck of the ve&s;&s;els.</P>
<P>There were other cares, which had the pre&s;er|vation of the health of the crews for their object; and the&s;e continually occupied a great number of our hands. Captain Cook's e&s;tabli&s;hed orders of airing the beds, having fires between decks, &s;moking them with gunpowder, and wa&s;hing them with vinegar, were invariably ob&s;erved. Even the mending of the &s;ailors old jackets was now become a duty of importance. Tho&s;e who are acquainted with the habits and di&s;po&s;ition of &s;eamen, require to be informed, that they are &s;o accu&s;tomed to be directed by their officers, re&s;pecting the care of them&s;elves, that they con|tract the thoughtle&s;&s;ne&s;s of infants. It is very certain, that had our people been &s;uffered to act according to their own di&s;cretion, the whole crew would have been naked, before half the comple|tion of the voyage. It might naturally be &s;up|po&s;ed, from their having experienced a voyage to the north the la&s;t year, that they would be tho|roughly &s;en&s;ible of the nece&s;&s;ity of paying atten|tion
<PB N="345" REF="030274_1175_0FE5761F53478C00">
to the&s;e matters; but the&s;e reflections never operated upon them; for as &s;oon as we returned to the tropical climates, their fur jackets, and other articles calculated for cold climates, were kicked about the decks as u&s;ele&s;s and in&s;ignifi|cant; though every one among us knew we were to make another voyage towards the Pole. They were, however, taken up and put into ca&s;ks, by the officers, and, about this time, re&s;tored to their proper owners.</P>
<P>We perceived in the afternoon &s;ome of the &s;heathing floated by the &s;hip; and di&s;covered, upon examination, that about fourteen feet had been wa&s;hed off under the lar-board bow; where the leak was &s;uppo&s;ed to have been, which had kept the people employed at the pumps, ever &s;ince our departure from the Sandwich I&s;lands; making twelve inches water an hour. A number of &s;mall crabs, of a pale blue colour, we had this day a &s;ight of; and were again accompanied by &s;heer-waters of albatro&s;&s;es. In the night-time, the thermometer &s;unk eleven degrees; and, though it was then as high as 69&deg;, we endured much from the cold; our feelings not being yet reconciled to that degree of temperature.</P>
<P>We had a fre&s;h wind from the north, till Thur&s;|day the 8th, in the morning: it then became more moderate, and was accompanied with fair weather. Afterwards it changed its direction to the ea&s;t, and then to the &s;outh.</P>
<P><PB N="346" REF="030274_1176_0FE576BF29F224D8">About noon, on the 9th, we were in the lati|tude of 32&deg; 16&prime;, and in the longitude of 166&deg; 40&prime;. On the 10th, we cro&s;&s;ed the track by which the Spani&s;h galleons pa&s;s from the Manillas to Aca|pulco, and expected to have &s;een the i&s;land of Rica de Plata; who, according to De Li&s;le's chart, which points out the route of tho&s;e &s;hips, ought to have appeared. Its latitude is there mentioned to be 34&deg; 30&prime; north, and its longitude 166&deg; ea&s;t. Though &s;o far advanced to the north|ward, we this day &s;aw a tropic bird; and &s;everal other kinds of oceanic birds; &s;uch as &s;heer-waters, albatro&s;&s;es, puffins, and &s;ea-parrots.</P>
<P>At noon, on the 11th, our latitude was 35&deg; 30&prime;. and our longitude 165&deg; 45&prime;. We this day &s;aw plenty of &s;ea-birds, and &s;everal bunches of &s;ea-weed. The Di&s;covery al&s;o pa&s;&s;ed a log of wood; but no other &s;igns of land appeared.</P>
<P>On the 12th, the wind veered to the ea&s;t, and blew &s;o &s;trong a gale as to oblige us to &s;trike our top-gallant yards. We happened, unfortunately, to be upon the mo&s;t di&s;advantageous tack for our leak. But, having always kept it under with the hand-pumps, it gave us but little concern till Tue&s;day the 13th, at &s;ix in the afternoon, when a &s;udden inundation deluged the whole &s;pace be|tween decks, and alarmed us much. The water, which had made its way into the coal-hole, not finding a pa&s;&s;age into the well, had forced up the platforms over it, and in&s;tantaneou&s;ly &s;et every
<PB N="347" REF="030274_1177_0FE576404698CC08">
thing afloat. Our &s;ituation was the more di&s;|tre&s;&s;ing, as we could not immediately di&s;cover any means of relieving our&s;elves. It could be of no &s;ervice to place a pump through the upper|decks into the coal-hole; and it was become im|practicable to bale the water out with buckets. We had, therefore, no other expedient left, than to cut a hole through the bulk-head, which &s;epa|rated the coal-hole from the fore-hold, and thus form a pa&s;&s;age for the water into the well. Before this could be effected, however, the ca&s;ks of dry provi&s;ions were to be got out of the fore-hold, which took us the remainder of the night; the carpenters, therefore, could not get at the parti|tion till the next morning. The pa&s;&s;age being made, the principal part of the water ran into the well, when we were enabled to get out the re&s;t with buckets. The leak was now greatly in|crea&s;ed, in&s;omuch that half of our people were con&s;tantly employed in pumping and baleing, till the 15th, at noon. Our men &s;ubmitted chear|fully to this exce&s;&s;ive fatigue; and, to add to their &s;ufferings, they had not a dry place to &s;leep in: but, in order to make them &s;ome amends, they were permitted to have their full allowance of grog.</P>
<P>As the weather grew more moderate, and the &s;well abated, we cleared away the re&s;t of the ca&s;ks from the fore-hold, and made a proper pa&s;&s;age for the water to the pumps. We &s;aw a piece of

<P>At noon, on the 16th, our latitude was 42&deg; 12&prime;, and our longitude 160&deg; 5&prime;; and, being near the &s;ituation where De Gama is &s;aid to have &s;een a great extent of land, we were glad of an oppor|tunity of contributing to remove the doubts, if any yet remained, re&s;pecting this pretended di&s;|covery. It is &s;omewhat remarkable that it can|not be di&s;covered who this John De Gama was, when he lived, or at what time he made this di&s;|covery.</P>
<P>Muller relates, that the fir&s;t account of it was in a chart publi&s;hed by Texeira, in 1649; who places it between the latitude of 44&deg; and 45&prime;, and calls it "land &s;een by John De Gama, in a voyage from China to New Spain." Why the French geographers have removed it five degrees to the ea&s;tward, we cannot comprehend; unle&s;s we &s;uppo&s;e it to have been to make room for another fre&s;h di&s;covery made by the Dutch, called Company's land.</P>
<P>The wind was very un&s;ettled the whole day, and blew in fre&s;h gu&s;ts, which were &s;ucceeded by dead calms. Though the&s;e were not unpromi&s;ing appearances, yet, after &s;tanding off and on the whole day, without perceiving land, we &s;teered to the northward; not chu&s;ing to lo&s;e much time
<PB N="349" REF="030274_1179_0FE5761093A0C7C0">
in &s;earch of an object, the exi&s;tence of which was univer&s;ally di&s;believed. The whole of the 16th, our people were employed in drying their wet things, and in airing the &s;hips below.</P>
<P>The increa&s;ing inclemency of the northern climate was now &s;everely felt. On the 18th, in the morning, we were in the latitude of 45&deg; 40&prime;, and the longitude of 160&deg; 25&prime;. We had &s;now, &s;leet, and &s;trong gales from the &s;outh-we&s;t. Con|&s;idering the &s;ea&s;on of the year, and the quarter from which the wind came, this is rather a re|markable circum&s;tance. In the day-time of the 19th, the thermometer remained at the freezing point, and fell to 29&deg; at four in the morning. On comparing the degree of heat, during the &s;ultry weather at the beginning of this month, with the extreme cold which we now endured, &s;ome idea may be formed of our &s;ufferings upon &s;o rapid a change.</P>
<P>The gale which we had on the 18th, had &s;plit mo&s;t of the &s;ails we had bent; and as the&s;e were our &s;econd &s;uit, we were obliged to have recour&s;e to our la&s;t and be&s;t &s;et. Captain Clerke's difficul|ties were augmented by the &s;ea being generally &s;o rough, and the &s;hips &s;o extremely leaky, that there was no place to repair the &s;ails in, except his apart|ments, which was a &s;erious inconvenience to him, in his declining &s;tate of health.</P>
<P>At noon on the 20th, our latitude was 40&deg; 45&prime; north, and our longitude 161&deg; 15&prime; ea&s;t, and we
<PB N="350" REF="030274_1180_0FE57729F9E4C148">
earne&s;tly expected to fall in with the coa&s;t of A&s;ia; when the wind &s;hifted to the north, where it continued the day following. Though our pro|gre&s;s was thus retarded, we were con&s;iderably re|fre&s;hed by the fair weather it produced. On the 21&s;t, in the forenoon, we had the &s;ight of a whale, and a land bird; and, as the water appeared muddy, we founded in the afternoon, but could not find ground with an hundred and forty fathoms of line. In the cour&s;e of the three preceding days, we &s;aw a large quantity of wild-fowl, &s;ome|what re&s;embling ducks. This u&s;ually indicates the vicinity of land, but no other &s;igns of it had been &s;een &s;ince the 16th, in which time we had &s;ailed an hundred and fifty leagues and upwards.</P>
<P>The wind &s;hifted to the north-ea&s;t, on the 22d, and was attended with mi&s;ty weather. The cold was &s;o inten&s;e, and the ropes frozen to &s;uch a de|gree, that it was a bu&s;ine&s;s of great difficulty to force them through the blocks. On comparing our pre&s;ent po&s;ition with the &s;outhern parts of Kamt&s;chatka, as given in the Ru&s;&s;ian charts, Cap|tain Clerke thought it might be dangerous to run on towards the land all night. We therefore tacked at ten, &s;ounded, and had ground with &s;eventy fathoms of line.</P>
<P>At &s;ix in the morning of the 23d, the fog clear|ing away we &s;aw mountains covered with &s;now, and a high conical rock, at the di&s;tance of about three or four leagues. &s;oon after we had taken
<PB N="351" REF="030274_1181_0FE576AEA7F76E18">
this imperfect view, a thick fog again appeared. According to our maps, we were now but eight leagues from the entrance of Awat&s;ka Bay; there|fore, when the weather cleared up, we &s;tood in to take a nearer &s;urvey of the country; when a mo&s;t di&s;mal and dreary pro&s;pect pre&s;ented it&s;elf. The coa&s;t is &s;traight and uniform, without bays, or inlets; from the &s;hore, the ground ri&s;es in moderate hills, and behind them are ranges of mountains, who&s;e &s;ummits penetrate the clouds. The whole was covered with &s;now, except the &s;ides of &s;ome cliffs, which ro&s;e too perpendicu|larly from the &s;ea, to permit the &s;now to lie upon them.</P>
<P>The wind blew &s;trong from the north-ea&s;t, with hazy weather and fleet, from the 24th to the 28th; the thermometer, during that time, being never higher than 30 &frac12;&deg;. The &s;hip re&s;embled a com|plete ma&s;s of ice; the &s;hrouds being &s;o incru&s;ted with it, as to double their dimen&s;ions: and, in|deed, the olde&s;t &s;eaman among us had never ex|perienced &s;uch continued &s;howers of fleet, and that extremity of cold, which we had now to encounter. The inclemency of the weather, the difficulty of working our &s;hips, and the in|ce&s;&s;ant duty required at the pumps, rendered the &s;ervice intolerable to many of our crew; &s;ome of whom were much fro&s;t-bitten, and others were confined with colds. We continued &s;tanding four hours on each tack, having &s;oundings of &s;ixty
<PB N="352" REF="030274_1182_0FE5772BE2B32208">
fathoms, when within three leagues of the land&punc; but no &s;ounding at double that di&s;tance.</P>
<P>We had, on the 25th. an imperfect glance of the entrance of Awat&s;ka Bay, but could not pre|&s;ume to venture into it, in the pre&s;ent condition of the weather. We again &s;tood off, when we lo&s;t &s;ight of the Di&s;covery, which gave us little concern, being now almo&s;t arrived at the place of rendezvous.</P>
<P>In the morning of the 28th, the weather cleared up, with a light breeze continuing from the &s;ame quarter. Having a fine warm day we were in expectation of a thaw, and therefore the men were bu&s;ied in taking the ice from the rigging, &s;ails, &amp;c. that it might not fall upon our heads. At noon, when our latitude was 52&deg; 44&prime;, and our longitude 159&deg;, the entrance of Awat&s;ka Bay bore north-we&s;t, at the di&s;tance of about three or four leagues; and, at three in the afternoon, we &s;tood in with a fair wind from the &s;outhward, having &s;oundings from twenty-two to &s;even fathoms.</P>
<P>The mouth of Awat&s;ka Bay opens in the di|rection of north north-we&s;t. On the &s;outh &s;ide, the land is moderately high: it ri&s;es, to the north|ward, into a bluff-head. Three remarkable rocks lie in the channel between them, not far from the north-ea&s;t &s;ide; and, on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide, a &s;ingle rock of a con&s;iderable &s;ize. There is a look-out hou&s;e on the north-head, which is u&s;ed as a light|hou&s;e

when any of the Ru&s;&s;ian &s;hips are expect|ed upon the coa&s;t. It had a flag-&s;taff in it; but there did not appear to be any per&s;on there.</P>
<P>Pa&s;&s;ing the mouth of the bay, which extends about four miles in length, a circular ba&s;on pre|&s;ents it&s;elf, of about twenty-five miles in circum|ference; in which, at about four o'clock, we anchored in &s;ix fathom water; fearing to run foul of a &s;hoal mentioned by Muller to lie in the channel. Great quantities of loo&s;e ice drifted with the tide in the middle of the bay; but the &s;hores were wholly blocked up with it. Plenty of wild-fowl, of various kinds, were &s;een; al&s;o large flights of Greenland pigeons; together with ravens and eagles. We looked at every corner of the bay, to &s;ee if we could di&s;cern the town of St. Peter and St. Paul, which, from the accounts we had received at Oonala&s;hka, we &s;uppo&s;ed to be a place of &s;trength and con&s;equence. At la&s;t we perceived to the north-ea&s;t, &s;ome mi&s;erable log-hou&s;es, and a few conical huts, amounting, in the whole to about thirty; which, from their &s;ituation we concluded to be Petropaulow&s;ka. In ju&s;tice, however, to the ho&s;pitable treatment we found here, it may not be ami&s;s to anticipate the reader's curio&s;ity, by a&s;&s;uring him, that our di&s;appointment proved in the end, a matter of entertainment to us. In this wretched extremity of the earth, beyond conception barbarous and in|ho&s;pitable, out of the reach of civilization, bound
<PB N="354" REF="030274_1184_0FE576CBF75B5360">
and barricadoed with ice, and covered with &s;um|mer &s;now, we experienced the tendere&s;t feelings of humanity, joined to a noblene&s;s of mind, and elevation of &s;entiment, which would have done honour to any clime or nation.</P>
<P>In the morning of the 29th, at day-light, Mr. King was &s;ent with the boats to examine the bay, and to pre&s;ent the letters to the Ru&s;&s;ian com|mander, which we had brought from Oonala&s;hka. We proceeded towards the village ju&s;t mentioned, and, having advanced as far as we could with the boats, we got upon the ice, which reached about half a mile from the &s;hore. Mr. King was at|tended by Mr. Webber, and two of the &s;eamen, whil&s;t the ma&s;ter went to fini&s;h the &s;urvey; the jolly boat being left to carry us back.</P>
<P>Probably the inhabitants had not, by this time, &s;een either the &s;hips or the boats; for, even on the ice, no appearance of a living creature could be &s;een in the town. When farther advanced on the ice, a few men were &s;een hurrying back|wards and forwards; and afterwards a &s;ledge with one per&s;on in it, and drawn by dogs, approach|ed us.</P>
<P>Struck with the unu&s;ual &s;ight, and admiring the civility of this &s;tranger, who we &s;uppo&s;ed was coming to our a&s;&s;i&s;tance, we were a&s;toni&s;hed to &s;ee him turn &s;hort round, and direct his cour&s;e towards the <HI>o&s;trog.</HI> We were equally chagrined and di&s;appointed at this abrupt departure; e&s;pe|cially
<PB N="355" REF="030274_1185_0FE57690A7049238">
as our journey over the ice began to be both difficult and dangerous. At every &s;tep we took, we &s;unk almo&s;t knee-deep in the &s;now; and, though there was tolerable footing at the bottom, the weak parts of the ice were not di&s;|coverable, and we were continually expo&s;ed to the ri&s;k of breaking through it. Indeed this accident actually happened to Mr. King; but, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a boat-hook, he was enabled to get upon firm ice again.</P>
<P>The nearer we approached the &s;hore, we found the ice &s;till more broken. The &s;ight of another &s;ledge advancing towards us, however, afforded us &s;ome comfort. But, in&s;tead of coming, to re|lieve us, the driver &s;topt &s;hort, and called out to us. Mr. King immediately held up I&s;myloff's letters. In con&s;equence of which, he turned about, and went full &s;peed back again; followed with the execrations of &s;ome of our party. Un|able to draw any conclu&s;ion from this unaccount|able behaviour, we &s;till proceeded towards the <HI>o&s;trog,</HI> with the greate&s;t circum&s;pection; and, when at the di&s;tance of about a quarter of a mile from it, we ob&s;erved a body of armed men ad|vancing towards us. To avoid giving them any alarm, and to pre&s;erve the mo&s;t peaceable appear|ance, Mr. King and Mr. Webber marched in front, and the men, who had boat-hooks in their hands, were ordered in the rear. The armed party con&s;i&s;ted of about thirty &s;oldiers, preceded
<PB N="356" REF="030274_1186_0FE576E1A4CBE048">
by a per&s;on with a cane in his hand. Within a few paces of us, he halted, and drew up his men in a martial order. Mr. King pre&s;ented I&s;ma|loff's letters to him, and vainly endeavoured to make him under&s;tand that we were Engli&s;h, and had brought the&s;e di&s;patches from Oonala&s;hka.</P>
<P>Having attentively examined us, he conducted us towards the village in &s;olemn &s;ilence, frequent|ly halting his men, and making them perform different parts of their manual exerci&s;e; in order to &s;hew us, perhaps, that if we &s;hould pre&s;ume to offer any violence, we &s;hould have to deal with tho&s;e who knew what they were about.</P>
<P>During the whole of this time, Mr. King was in his wet clothes, &s;hivering with cold; yet he could not avoid being diverted with this mili|tary parade, though it was attended by an un&s;ea|&s;onable delay. Arriving, at length, at the habi|tation of the commanding officer of the party, we were u&s;hered in; and, after giving orders to the military without doors, our ho&s;t appeared, accompanied by the &s;ecretary of the port. One of the letters from Imyloff was now opened, and the other &s;ent expre&s;s to Bolcheret&s;k, a town on the we&s;t &s;ide of Kamt&s;chatka, and the place of re&s;idence of the Ru&s;&s;ian commander of this province.</P>
<P>It appears extraordinary, that the natives had not &s;een the Re&s;olution the preceding day, when we anchored in the bay; nor this morning till our

boats approach the ice. The fir&s;t &s;ight of the &s;hip, we under&s;tood, had &s;truck them with a con|&s;iderable panic. The garri&s;on was in&s;tantly put under arms; two field-pieces were placed before the commander's hou&s;e; and powder, &s;hot, and lighted matches were all in readine&s;s.</P>
<P>The officer, who had conducted us to his hou&s;e, was a &s;erjeant; and al&s;o the commander of the <HI>o&s;trog.</HI> After he had recovered from the alarm which our arrival had produced, the kindne&s;s and ho&s;pitality of his behaviour was a&s;toni&s;hing. His hou&s;e, indeed, was intolerably hot, but remark|ably neat and clean. After Mr. King had chang|ed his clothes, by putting on a complete &s;uit of the &s;erjeant's, at his earne&s;t reque&s;t; we were re|que&s;ted to partake of a dinner, which was doubt|le&s;s the be&s;t he could procure; and, con&s;idering our vi&s;it was unexpected, was ingeniou&s;ly con|ducted. To have prepared &s;oup and <HI>bouillit,</HI> would have required &s;ome time; in&s;tead of which, we had &s;ome cold beef &s;liced, with boiling water poured over it. After that we were regaled with a large roa&s;ted bird, the ta&s;te of which was mo&s;t delicious, though we were unacquainted with its &s;pecies. Having eaten a part of this, it was re|moved, and fi&s;h were &s;erved up, dre&s;&s;ed in two different methods. Soon after which the bird ap|peared again in &s;avoury and &s;weet <HI>pates.</HI> Our liquor was &s;uch as the Ru&s;&s;ians di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of <HI>qua&s;s,</HI> and was the mo&s;t indifferent

part of our entertainment. The &s;erjeant's wife &s;erved up &s;everal of the di&s;hes, and was not per|mitted to &s;it down at table with us.</P>
<P>Our repa&s;t being fini&s;hed, during which our conver&s;ation was limited to a few bows, and other per&s;onal tokens of mutual re&s;pect, we &s;trove to explain to our ho&s;t, the occa&s;ion of our vi&s;it to this port. Probably I&s;maloff had written to them on this &s;ubject, in the letters we had deli|vered, as we made him readily conceive our meaning; but, as there was not a per&s;on in the place, who knew any other language than Ru&s;&s;ian or Kamt&s;chadale, we found it extremely difficult to comprehend what he endeavoured to commu|nicate to us. After much time &s;pent in our at|tempts to under&s;tand each other, the &s;um of the intelligence we had received appeared to be, that, though we could not be &s;upplied with pro|vi&s;ions or &s;tores at this place, yet tho&s;e articles were to be procured, in great plenty, at Bolche|ret&s;k. That he doubted not, but the comman|der would readily &s;upply us with what we want|ed; but that, till he had received his orders, neither he, nor any of the natives, could even venture on board the ve&s;&s;el.</P>
<P>It being now time for us to depart, and as Mr. King's clothes were not yet dry, he again had recour&s;e to the &s;erjeant's benevolence for his leave to carry tho&s;e on board which he had bor|rowed of him. This reque&s;t was chearfully com|plied
<PB N="359" REF="030274_1190_0FE5770CC4041F38">
with; and a &s;ledge, with five dogs, and a driver, was in&s;tantly provided for each of our party. This mode of conveyance afforded high entertainment for the &s;ailors; and they were de|lighted &s;till more, when they found that the two boat-hooks had a &s;ledge appropriated &s;olely to them&s;elves. The&s;e &s;ledges are &s;o light, and &s;o admirably con&s;tructed for the purpo&s;es they are intended, that they went &s;afely and expeditiou&s;ly over the ice, which we &s;hould have found ex|tremely difficult to have pa&s;&s;ed on foot.</P>
<P>The boats, on our return, were towing the Re&s;olution towards the village; and, at &s;even, we moored clo&s;e to the ice; the entrance of the bay bearing &s;outh by ea&s;t, and the <HI>o&s;treg</HI> north, at the di&s;tance of one mile and a half.</P>
<P>On the morning of the 30th, the ca&s;ks and cables were taken to the quarter-deck, to lighten the ve&s;&s;el forward; and the carpenters proceeded to &s;top the leak, which had occa&s;ioned us &s;o much trouble. It appeared to have been occa|&s;ioned by &s;ome &s;heathing falling off from the larboard-bow, and the oakum having been wa&s;h|ed out from between the planks. We had &s;uch warm weather in the middle of the day, that the ice began to break away very fa&s;t, and almo&s;t choaked up the entrance of the bay. Several of our officers waited upon the &s;erjeant, who receiv|ed them with great civility; and Captain Clerke made him a pre&s;ent of two bottles of rum, think|ing
<PB N="360" REF="030274_1191_0FE57731DDB72998">
he could not &s;end him any thing more ac|ceptable. In our return, he received twenty fine trouts, and &s;ome excellent fouls of the grou&s;e kind. Though the bay &s;warmed with ducks and Greenland pigeons, our &s;port&s;men had no &s;ucce&s;s, for they were &s;o exceedingly &s;hy as not to come within &s;hot.</P>
<P>On the fir&s;t of May, in the morning, we &s;aw the Di&s;covery &s;tanding in the bay; a boat was di&s;patched to her a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and &s;he was moored, in the afternoon, clo&s;e by the Re&s;olution. We were then informed, that, after the weather be|came clear on the 28th, (the day &s;he parted com|pany) they were to leeward of the bay; and the following day, when they got abrea&s;t of it, &s;ee|ing the entrance choaked up with ice, they fired guns and &s;tood off, &s;uppo&s;ing we could not be here; but afterwards, perceiving it was only drift ice, they ventured to come in.</P>
<P>On Sunday the 2d, we had heavy &s;howers of &s;now, and the weather was &s;o exceedingly un&s;et|tled, that the carpenters could not proceed in their bu&s;ine&s;s. In the evening the thermometer &s;tood at 28&deg;, and the fro&s;t in the night was re|markably &s;evere.</P>
<P>Two &s;ledges being ob&s;erved to drive into the village, on the morning of the 3d, Mr. King was ordered on &s;hore, to learn whether any an|&s;wer was arrived from the commander of Kamt&s;|chatka, which the &s;erjeant informed us might be
<PB N="361" REF="030274_1192_0FE5767E52792810">
rea&s;onably expected about this time. The di&s;|tance from Bolcheret&s;k to St. Peter and St. Paul's, is one hundred and thirty-five Engli&s;h miles. The dogs were &s;ent off with our di&s;patches, on the 29th at noon; and returned with an an&s;wer, as we were afterwards informed, early this morn|ing: &s;o that they performed a journey of two hundred and &s;eventy miles, in a little more than three days and a half.</P>
<P>For the pre&s;ent, however, the return of the commander's an&s;wer was concealed from us; and, on Mr. King's arrival at the &s;erjeant's, he was informed that he &s;hould hear from him the next day. While Mr. King was on &s;hore, the boat in which he came, and another belonging to the Di&s;covery, were bound fa&s;t by the ice. In this &s;ituation, the Di&s;covery's launch was &s;ent to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, which &s;oon partook of the &s;ame fate; and, &s;hortly after, they were &s;urrounded with ice to a great extent. Thus &s;ituated, we were obliged to continue on &s;hore till the evening; when, giving over the thoughts of getting the boats off at that time, &s;ome of us were conveyed in &s;ledges to the edge of the ice, where the boats from the &s;hip took us off, and the re&s;t continued all night on &s;hore.</P>
<P>It froze extremely hard during the night; but, in the morning of the 4th, the floating ice was drifted away by a change of wind; and the boats
<PB N="362" REF="030274_1193_0FE576B256127F58">
were &s;et at liberty without &s;u&s;taining the &s;malle&s;t damage.</P>
<P>At ten in the forenoon, &s;everal &s;ledges arriv|ing at the edge of the ice, a boat was &s;ent from the &s;hip to conduct tho&s;e who were in them on board. One of them proved to be a Ru&s;&s;ian merchant from Bolcheret&s;k, who&s;e name was Fedo&s;it&s;ch; and the other a German, named Port, with di&s;patches from Major Behm, commander of Kamt&s;chatka, to Captain Clerke.</P>
<P>Arriving at the edge of the ice, and &s;eeing di&s;|tinctly the magnitude of the &s;hips, which were then within two hundred yards of them, they were exceedingly alarmed; and before they ventured to embark, &s;tipulated that two of our boat's crew &s;hould remain on &s;hore, as ho&s;tages for their &s;afety. It afterwards appeared, that I&s;myloff, in the epi&s;tle he had written to the commander, (for rea&s;ons which we cannot comprehend) had men|tioned our ve&s;&s;els as two &s;mall trading boats; and that the &s;erjeant, having &s;een the &s;hips but at a di&s;tance, had not rectified that mi&s;take.</P>
<P>After they were come on board, we perceived by their timorous and cautious behaviour, that they entertained &s;ome very extraordinary appre|hen&s;ions. They were greatly elated, however, when the German found a per&s;on among us, with whom he could enter into conver&s;ation. Mr. Webber &s;poke that language fluently, and con|vinced them, though not without difficulty, that
<PB N="363" REF="030274_1194_0FE576BBEF8C2E20">
we were Engli&s;hmen and friends. Mr. Port was introduced to Captain Clerke, to whom he deli|vered the commander's letter. It was written in the German language, and merely compli|mental, giving him and his officers an invitation to Bolcheret&s;k. Mr. Port al&s;o told Captain Clerke, that the Major had been mi&s;informed, re&s;pecting the &s;ize of the &s;hips, and the &s;ervice in which we were engaged; I&s;myloff having called our two ve&s;&s;els Engli&s;h packet-boats, and warned him to be cautious; intimating, as he &s;uppo&s;ed, that he &s;u&s;pected we were pirates. This letter, he &s;aid, had given birth to various con|jectures about us at Bolcheret&s;k; that the Major apprehended we might be on a trading plan, and therefore had &s;ent a merchant to us; but that the officer next in command, imagined we were French, arrived with &s;ome ho&s;tile intentions, and that mea&s;ures ought to be pur&s;ued accordingly. He added, that the Major had been obliged to exert all his authority to prevent the inhabitants from quitting the town, &s;o much were they alarm|ed, from the apprehen&s;ion of our being French.</P>
<P>The&s;e alarms were principally occa&s;ioned by &s;ome circum&s;tances in an in&s;urrection which had happened at Bolcheret&s;k, not many years ago, in which the commander was killed. We were told, that Beniow&s;ki, an exiled Poli&s;h officer, &s;eeing the town in great confu&s;ion, took that op|portunity of &s;eizing upon a galliot, lying at the
<PB N="364" REF="030274_1195_0FE57733B06F8D28">
entrance of the Bolchoireeka, and forced a &s;uf|ficient number of Ru&s;&s;ian &s;ailors on board to na|vigate her; that part of the crew were put on &s;hore at the Kourile I&s;lands, and I&s;myloff among the re&s;t; who, as we have already ob&s;erved, puz|zled us exceedingly with a narrative of this tran&s;|action at Oonala&s;hka; though we then found it difficult to under&s;tand all the circum&s;tances at|tending it: that he had a view of Japan; made Luconia, where he was in&s;tructed how to &s;teer to Canton; that arriving there, he got a pa&s;&s;age to France in one of the French India &s;hips; mo&s;t of the Ru&s;&s;ians having al&s;o returned to Eu|rope in French &s;hips; and afterwards proceeded to Peter&s;burgh. We gathered the circum&s;tances of the above &s;tory, from three of Beniow&s;ki's crew, whom we met with in the harbour of St. Peter and St. Paul.</P>
<P>We received a farther corroboration of the&s;e facts, on our arrival at Canton, from the gentle|men belonging to the Engli&s;h factory there; who informed us, that a per&s;on in a Ru&s;&s;ian galliot had arrived there, who told them he came from Kamt&s;chatka, and that the French factory had furni&s;hed him with a pa&s;&s;age to Europe.</P>
<P>We were much diverted with the fears and ap|prehen&s;ions of the&s;e people; and e&s;pecially with an account, given by Mr. Port, of the &s;erjeant's extreme caution the day before. On &s;eeing Mr. King and &s;ome other gentlemen come on &s;hore,
<PB N="365" REF="030274_1196_0FE57715B88EAB10">
he concealed him and the Ru&s;&s;ian merchant in the kitchen, to give them an opportunity of li&s;tening to our conver&s;ation with each other, in order to di&s;cover, whether we were Engli&s;hmen or not.</P>
<P>Imagining, from the appearance of Mr. Port, that he might probably be the commander's &s;e|cretary, we was con&s;idered in that light, and was invited, with the Ru&s;&s;ian merchant, to dine with Captain Clerke. Soon, however, we began to &s;u&s;pect, from the behaviour of the merchant, that Mr. Port was no more than a common &s;er|vant; but, not choo&s;ing to &s;acrifice our little comforts at our pride, we avoided an explana|tion, by not permitting &s;uch a que&s;tion to be propo&s;ed to him; he therefore continued upon a footing of equality with us, and we, in return, reaped the advantage of his abilities as a lingui&s;t.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>BY the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of our interpreter, we were now enabled to conver&s;e with the Ru&s;&s;ians, with &s;ome degree of facility; and the fir&s;t objects of our enquiries, were the means of procuring fre&s;h provi&s;ions and naval &s;tores; particularly the latter, for the want of which we had been long
<PB N="367" REF="030274_1198_0FE576F599056D10">
in great di&s;tre&s;s. It appeared, upon enquiry, that the whole country about the bay, could fur|ni&s;h no other live cattle than two heifers; and the&s;e the &s;erjeant engaged to procure for us. Our next applications were made to the merchant, who&s;e terms for &s;erving us were &s;o exorbitant, that Captain Clerke thought it expedient to &s;end an officer to the commander at Bolcheret&s;k, to learn the price of &s;tores at that place. This de|termination being communicated to Mr. Port, he &s;ent an expre&s;s to the commander to acquaint him with our intentions, and to remove the &s;u&s;picions that were entertained, re&s;pecting the purpo&s;es of our voyage.</P>
<P>Captain Clerke fixed upon Mr. King for this &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">vice, and ordered him to prepare for &s;etting out the next day, together with Mr. Webber, who was to accompany him as interpreter. That day and the next, however, proved too &s;tormy for beginning a journey through &s;o de&s;olate and wild a country; but on the 7th of May, the weather became more favourable, and we &s;et out in the &s;hip's boats, early in the morning, in order to arrive at the entrance of the Awat&s;ka at high water, on account of the &s;hoals at the mouth of that river. The country boats were to meet us here, to conduct us up the &s;tream. Captain Core was al&s;o added to our party; and we were ac|companied by Mr. Port and the Ru&s;&s;ian mer|chant, with two co&s;&s;acks, having been previou&s;ly
<PB N="368" REF="030274_1199_0FE5778A0D338828">
furni&s;hed with warm furred clothing; a very ne|ce&s;&s;ary precaution, as it began to &s;now bri&s;kly im|mediately after our &s;etting out. About eight o'clock, we were &s;topped by &s;hoal water, within a mile of the mouth of the river, when &s;ome Kamt&s;chadales took us and our baggage, in &s;ome &s;mall canoes, and conveyed us over a bank of &s;and, which the rapidity of the river had thrown up, and which, we are informed, was continually &s;hifting. Having pa&s;&s;ed this &s;hoal, the water again deepened, and we were furni&s;hed with a commo|dious boat, re&s;embling a Norway yawl, to con|vey us up the river; together with canoes for the reception of our baggage.</P>
<P>The breadth of the mouth of the Awat&s;ka is about a quarter of a mile, but it gradually nar|rowed as we advanced. Having proceeded a few miles, we pa&s;&s;ed &s;everal branches; many of which we were told, emptied them&s;elves into other parts of the bay; and that &s;ome of tho&s;e, on the left, ran into the Paratounca river. For the fir&s;t ten miles, the general direction of the river, from the bay, is to the north; and afterwards it turns to the we&s;tward. Except this bend, it chiefly pre|&s;erves a &s;traight cour&s;e; and flows through a low flat country, to the di&s;tance of thirty miles from the &s;ea, which is &s;ubject to frequent inundations. Six men were employed in pu&s;hing us on with long poles, three of them being at each end of the boat; and proceeded again&s;t the &s;tream, at
<PB N="369" REF="030274_1200_0FE5779755B0E310">
the rate of about three miles an hour. Our con|ductors endured this &s;eve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> labour for ten hours; &s;topping only once, and that for a &s;hort &s;pace of time, to take a little refre&s;hment.</P>
<P>Being told, at our fir&s;t &s;etting out, that we could ea&s;ily reach Karatchin that night, we were greatly di&s;appointed to find our&s;elves fifteen miles from that place at &s;un-&s;et. This was attributed to the delay in pa&s;&s;ing the &s;hoals, both at the en|trance of the river, and in many other places.</P>
<P>Our men being exceedingly fatigued, and as the difficulty of navigating the river would have increa&s;ed by the darkne&s;s of the night, we de|clined all thoughts of proceeding on our journey that evening: we therefore fixed upon a place that was tolerably well &s;heltered, and, clearing it of the &s;now, erected a &s;mall marqu&eacute;e, which we had providentially taken with us; and, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a good fire, and &s;ome excellent punch, pa&s;&s;ed the night agreeably. Our principal incon|venience was the being obliged to keep at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance from the fire; for, as &s;oon as it was lighted, it thawed every part round it into an ab&s;olute puddle. The Kamt&s;chadales were extremely alert and expeditious in erecting our marqu&eacute;e, and cooking our provi&s;ions; but we were much &s;urprized at finding they had brought with them their uten&s;ils for making tea, con&s;ider|ing it as a mo&s;t intolerable hard&s;hip if they can|not,
<PB N="370" REF="030274_1201_0FE57795A9F30768">
two or three times a day, regale them&s;elves with drinking tea.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as it was light, in the morning, we pro|ceeded on our journey, and, before we had made much progre&s;s, were met by the <HI>Toion,</HI> or chief of Karatchin, who, being apprized of our coming, had provided canoes that were better accommo|dated for navigating the higher parts of the river. A commodious ve&s;&s;el (made by la&s;hing two canoes together) furni&s;hed with fur cloaks, and lined with bear-&s;kins, was al&s;o procured for us. We now proceeded rapidly, the Toion's people being remarkably expert in this kind of bu&s;ine&s;s. At ten we arrived at the <HI>o&s;trog,</HI> named Karatchin, and the &s;eat of his command; where we were received by the Kamt&s;chadale men and women, and &s;ome Ru&s;&s;ian &s;ervants belonging to the mer|chant, Fedo&s;itch. They were all attired in their be&s;t habilments; tho&s;e of the women being gay and plea&s;ing, and con&s;i&s;ting of a loo&s;e robe of white nankeen, gathered clo&s;e round the neck, and fa&s;tened with a &s;ilk collar. A &s;hort jacket, without &s;leeves, was worn over this, con&s;i&s;ting of different coloured nankeens; and they had petti|coats made of a &s;light Chine&s;e &s;ilk. Their &s;hifts, which were al&s;o made of &s;ilk, had &s;leeves extend|ing to the wri&s;ts; and their heads were bound with coloured &s;ilk handkerchiefs, which entirely concealed the hair of the married women; but the unmarried ones placed the handkerchief under
<PB N="371" REF="030274_1202_0FE5779AC77C7D18">
the hair, permitting it to flow loo&s;ely down the &s;houlders.</P>
<P>Karatchin was plea&s;antly &s;ituated on the &s;ide of the river, and was compo&s;ed of three log-hou&s;es, nineteen <HI>balagans,</HI> or &s;ummer habitations, and three <HI>jourts,</HI> which are hou&s;es under ground. The <HI>Toion,</HI> to who&s;e dwellings we were then conducted, was a plain decent man, &s;prung from a Ru&s;&s;ian mother, and a Kamt&s;chadale father. His hou&s;e, like all others in this country, con&s;i&s;ted of only two apartments. All the furniture in the outer room, was a long narrow table, with a bench round it; and the inner apartment, which was the kitchen, was al&s;o very &s;cantily furni&s;hed. But the hearty welcome, and kind attention of our ho&s;t, amply compen&s;ated for the poverty of his habitation.</P>
<P>The wife of the <HI>Toion</HI> was an excellent cook, and &s;erved us with various &s;orts of fi&s;h and game, and different kinds of heath-berries, which had been pre&s;erved &s;ince the la&s;t year. Whil&s;t we were dining in this mi&s;erable hut, the gue&s;ts of ab&s;olutely &s;trangers, and at the extremity of the habitable globe, a &s;olitary half-worn pewter &s;poon attracted our attention. Its form was familiar to us, and the word <HI>London</HI> was &s;tamped upon the back of it. It is impo&s;&s;ible to expre&s;s the anxious hopes and tender remembrances, this circum|&s;tance excited in us. Tho&s;e who have been long ab&s;ent from their native country, will readily
<PB N="372" REF="030274_1203_0FE5778753B4AD80">
conceived what inexpre&s;&s;ible plea&s;ure &s;uch trifling incidents can give.</P>
<P>Having now quitted the river, the next part of our journey was to be performed on &s;ledges; but the thaw had been &s;o great in the day-time, as not to permit us to &s;et out, till the &s;now was become hard and firm by the coldne&s;s of the evening. This furni&s;hed us with an opportunity of walking about the village, which was the only place in this country, that we had &s;een free from &s;now. It was &s;ituated on a flat, of about a mile and an half in circuit. The leaves of the trees were ju&s;t budding, and the verdure was &s;trongly contra&s;ted with the &s;urrounding hills, which remained cover|ed with &s;now. The &s;oil appeared to be capable of producing common vegetables, we were &s;ur|prized to find that not a &s;pot of it was cultivated. Neither were the inhabitants po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of cattle of any &s;ort. In &s;hort, their &s;ituation, during the winter months, mu&s;t be wretched beyond con|ception. They were now removing from their <HI>jourts</HI> to their <HI>balagans,</HI> which gave us an oppor|tunity of ob&s;erving both the&s;e &s;orts of habita|tions. The people invited us, very civilly, into their hou&s;es; chearfulne&s;s and content were vi&s;ible in every countenance, to which the approaching change of &s;ea&s;on might perhaps contribute.</P>
<P>On returning to our ho&s;t's, &s;upper was prepared for us, con&s;i&s;ting of the &s;ame articles which com|po&s;ed our former repa&s;t. When we had fini&s;hed
<PB N="373" REF="030274_1204_0FE57798DE3A7AC8">
our meal, we entertained the <HI>Toion</HI> and his wife with punch made of &s;ome of our &s;pirits; and Captain Gore, with his wonted genero&s;ity, made them &s;ome valuable pre&s;ents: after which, they retired to the kitchen, leaving us in the other room; on the benches of which we &s;pread our bear-&s;kins, and &s;ought a little repo&s;e; having fir&s;t &s;ettled with our conductors, to proceed on our journey, when the ground was judged to be in a &s;uitable condition.</P>
<P>The melancholy howlings of the dogs awaken|ed us about nine the &s;ame evening. During the whole time our baggage was la&s;hing upon the &s;ledges, their horrid noi&s;e continued; but, when they were yoked, and prepared for travelling, a chearful yelping &s;ucceeded, which cea&s;ed the in&s;tant they marched off.</P>
<P>The annexed engraving will &s;hew the figure of the &s;ledges: it was taken from one brought over by Mr. King, and now in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Sir A&s;hton Lever. The length of the body is about four feet and an half, and the breadth one foot. It is made in the form of a cre&s;cent, of light tough wood, fa&s;tened together with wicker work; and, among the principal people, is elegantly &s;tained with red and blue; the &s;eat being covered with furs or bear-&s;kins. It has four legs, about two feet in height, re&s;ting on two long flat pieces of wood, of the breadth of five or &s;ix inches, ex|tending a foot beyond the body of the &s;ledge, at
<PB N="374" REF="030274_1205_0FE577728A97B350">
each end. The&s;e run up before, &s;omewhat like a &s;kait, and are &s;hod with the bone of &s;ome &s;ea-animal. The carriage is ornamented, at the fore part with ta&s;&s;els off coloured cloth, and leather thongs. It has a cro&s;s bar, to which the harne&s;s is joined; and links of iron, or &s;mall bells, are hanging to it, which, by the jingling, is &s;up|po&s;ed to encourage the dogs. They &s;eldom carry more than one per&s;on at a time, who &s;its a &s;ide, with his feet on the lower part of the &s;ledge, having his baggage and provi&s;ions, in a bundle behind him. The u&s;ual number of dogs em|ployed in drawing this carriage, is five; four of them yoked two and two, and the other acting as leader. The reins being fa&s;tened to the collar, in&s;tead of the head, have no great command; and are therefore u&s;ually hung upon the &s;ledge; the driver depending principally on their obedi|ence to his voice. Great care and attention are con&s;equently u&s;ed in training up the leader, which frequently becomes very valuable on account of his &s;teadine&s;s and docility; the &s;um of forty rubles (or ten pounds) being no unu&s;ual price for one of them. The rider has al&s;o a crooked &s;tick, an&s;wering the purpo&s;e both of whip and reins; with which, by &s;triking in the &s;now, he can regulate the &s;peed of the dogs, or even &s;top them at plea&s;ure. When they are inattentive to their duty, he often cha&s;ti&s;es them by throwing it at them. The dexterity of the riders, in pick|ing
<PB N="375" REF="030274_1206_0FE577A08098A620">
this &s;tick up again, is very remarkable, and is the mo&s;t difficult manoeuvre in the exerci&s;e of their profe&s;&s;ion: nor is it, indeed, &s;urprizing that they &s;hould be &s;kilful in a practice in which they are &s;o materially intere&s;ted; for, they a&s;&s;ured us, that if a driver &s;hould happen to lo&s;e his &s;tick, the dogs immediately di&s;cover it; and, unle&s;s their leader is both &s;teady and re&s;olute, they will in&s;tantly &s;et off full &s;peed, and never &s;top till their &s;trength is exhau&s;ted; or till the carriage is overturned and da&s;hed to pieces, or hurried down a precipice, when all were buried in the &s;now. The accounts of the &s;peed of the&s;e animals, and of the hard&s;hips and fatigues they &s;uffer, would have appeared incredible, had they not been &s;up|ported by the greate&s;t authority. We our&s;elves were witne&s;&s;es of the extraordinary expedition with which the me&s;&s;enger returned, who had been di&s;patched to Bolcheret&s;k with the news of our arrival at St. Peter and St. Paul's, though the &s;now was exceedingly &s;oft. The Governor of Kamt&s;chatka a&s;&s;ured us, that this journey was u&s;ually performed in two days and an half; and that he had once received an expre&s;s from that harbour in twenty-three hours</P>
<P>During the winter, the dogs are fed on the offals of dried and &s;tinking fi&s;h; and, even this mi&s;erable food is withheld from them, a day before they &s;et out on a journey; and they are not per|mitted to eat a mor&s;el of any thing till they
<PB N="376" REF="030274_1207_0FE5778D199E51B0">
arrive at the end of it. They are frequently kept fa&s;ting for two entire days, in which time they will perform a journey of great extent. The &s;hape of the&s;e re&s;embles that of the Pomeranian breed, but they are con&s;iderably larger.</P>
<P>Not chu&s;ing to rely upon our own &s;kill, we had each of us a man to conduct the &s;ledge, which, in the condition the roads then, were proved a very laborious bu&s;ine&s;s: for, as the thaw had been prevalent in the vallies, through which was our regular road, we were obliged to travel along the &s;ides of the hills; our guides being under the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;upporting the &s;ledges, on the lower &s;ides, with their &s;houlders, for many miles together. Mr. King was attended by a good|natured Co&s;&s;ack, who was &s;o imperfect in his bu&s;ine&s;s, that he was continually overturned, which afforded entertainment to his companions. The party con&s;i&s;ted of ten &s;ledges in the whole. That which conducted Captain Gore, was formed of two la&s;hed together, and was plentifully fur|ni&s;hed with furs and bear-&s;kins. It was drawn by ten dogs, yoked four abrea&s;t; and tho&s;e which were laden with heavy baggage, were drawn by the &s;ame number.</P>
<P>We had proceeded about four miles on our journey, when it began to rain, which, together with the darkne&s;s of the night, threw us into &s;ome confu&s;ion. It was, after &s;ome little con&s;ul|tation, agreed, that we &s;hould continue where
<PB N="377" REF="030274_1208_0FE577A496F74D90">
we were till day-light; we therefore &s;ecured our &s;ledges, wrapped our&s;elves up in furs, and waited patiently for the morning. At three o'clock we were &s;ummoned to proceed; our guides expre&s;&s;ing their apprehen&s;ions, that if we waited any longer, the thaw would perhaps &s;top us, and prevent our advancing or returning. Though we had many difficulties to encounter, owing principally to the bad condition of the road, we got &s;afe to an <HI>o&s;trog</HI> about two in the afternoon. It is called Natcheekin, and is &s;ituated on a &s;mall &s;tream, which falls into the Belchoireka, at &s;ome di&s;tance below the town. It is twenty-five miles from Karatchin; which, by their account, we could have compa&s;&s;ed in four hours, had the fro&s;t con|tinued; but the &s;now was &s;o &s;oft that the poor animals &s;unk up to their bellies at almo&s;t every &s;tep; and it was indeed &s;urprizing that they &s;hould be able to &s;upport them&s;elves under &s;o fatiguing a journey.</P>
<P>This incon&s;iderable <HI>o&s;trog</HI> con&s;i&s;ts of one log|hou&s;e, the re&s;idence of the <HI>Toion,</HI> one <HI>jourt,</HI> and &s;ive <HI>balagans.</HI> We were received here with the &s;ame civility and ho&s;pitality as at Karatchin; and, in the afternoon, were conducted to a remarkable hot &s;pring, at a &s;mall di&s;tance from this village. Before we came very near it, we &s;aw a ri&s;ing &s;team from it, as from a boiling caldron; and, when we approached it, we perceived a &s;trong &s;ulphure|ous effluvia. A ba&s;on of about, three feet in
<PB N="378" REF="030274_1209_0FE577668AA309A8">
diameter, is formed by the main &s;pring; be&s;ides which, there are &s;everal le&s;&s;er &s;prings, of equal heat, in the adjacent ground; by which means the whole &s;pot, con&s;i&s;ting of about an acre, was &s;o very hot that we could not remain two minutes in the &s;ame place. The water i&s;&s;uing from the&s;e &s;prings, &s;upplies a &s;mall bathing pond, and after|wards a little rivulet, which conducts it into the river, at the di&s;tance of about an hundred and fifty yards. Great cures they informed us, had been effected by this bath, in rheumati&s;ms, &s;corbutic ulcers, &s;welled and contracted joints, and many other di&s;orders. Where the&s;e &s;prings flow, the ground is on a gentle a&s;cent; have a green hill of a moderate &s;ize behind it. Some plants &s;eem|ed to thrive here with great luxuriance, among which we ob&s;erved the wild garlick.</P>
<P>On the morning of the 10th, we embarked on the Bolchoireeka; and going with the &s;tream, expected to arrive at our journey's end the fol|lowing day. Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">gh Bolcheret&s;k is eighty miles from Natcheekin, we were informed, that, in the &s;ummer, when the melting of &s;now on the mountains has rendered the river full and rapid, the canoes have often gone there in a &s;ingle day: but now they told us we &s;hould be much longer, the ice having broken up only three days before our arrival, and our's being the fir&s;t boat that had attempted to pa&s;s. There was but too much truth in this intelligence; for we were greatly im|peded
<PB N="379" REF="030274_1210_0FE5774231D435D8">
by the &s;hallows; and, though the &s;tream was rapid in many places, we frequently had ripplings and &s;hoals, and were under the nece&s;&s;ity of hauling the boats over them. On each &s;ide of the river, the country was romantic, but not diver&s;ified: the cour&s;e of it being between craggy mountains, of a mo&s;t dreary and barren a&s;pect; with nothing to vary the &s;cene, except now and then the &s;ight of a bear, or a flock of wild fowl. This and the following night, we &s;lept under our marqu&eacute;e, on the banks of the river, and &s;uffered greatly from the &s;everity of the weather.</P>
<P>On the 12th, at day-light, we had pa&s;&s;ed the mountains, and were proceeding through a low exten&s;ive plain, on which were a number of &s;hrubby trees. At nine in the morning, we reached an <HI>o&s;trog,</HI> called Opatchin, of about the &s;ame magnitude as Karatchin, and &s;uppo&s;ed to be fifty miles from Natcheekin. A &s;erjeant and four Ru&s;&s;ian &s;oldiers had been here two day<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, waiting for our arrival; who in&s;tantly di&s;patch|ed a light boat to Bolcheret&s;k to give intelligence of our approach. A magnificent canoe, plenti|fully furni&s;hed with &s;kins and furs, was prepared for our reception, and we were very commo|diou&s;ly equipped; but our fellow-travellers were excluded. It gave us &s;ome concern to be &s;epa|rated from our old companion Mr. Port, who daily grew more &s;hy and di&s;tant, as we drew nearer to the completion of our journey. He acknow|ledged,
<PB N="380" REF="030274_1211_0FE5777CD2685F30">
indeed, before we &s;et out, that he was not entitled to the re&s;pect we had &s;hewn him; but, finding him di&s;creet, and not pre&s;uming, we had in&s;i&s;ted on his faring as we did, throughout the journey. We performed the remainder of our pa&s;&s;age, with the utmo&s;t ea&s;e and expedition; for, as we de&s;cended, the river grew more rapid, and had very few ob&s;tructions.</P>
<P>On our approaching Kamt&s;chatka, we judged, from an appearance of great &s;tir and bu&s;tle, that our reception was to be in form. This circum|&s;tance was di&s;agreeable to us; as decent clothing had long been &s;carce among us; and our travel|ling habits formed a &s;trange a&s;&s;emblage of the modes of India, Europe, and Kamt&s;chatka. To make a parade through the metropolis in this motley trim, we thought would appear ridicu|lous; and, as we ob&s;erved a crowd of people col|lected on the banks of the river, and were in|formed that the commander would receive us at the water-&s;ide, we &s;topped at the hou&s;e of a &s;ol|dier, about a quarter of a mile before we came to the town. Here we di&s;patch Mr. Port with a me&s;&s;age to his excellency, acquainting him, that, as &s;oon as we had put off our travelling dre&s;&s;es, we would attend him at his own hou&s;e, to pay our re&s;pects to him; and entreated him not to think of waiting to conduct us. He per&s;i&s;ted, how|ever, in his re&s;olution of paying us this compli|ment, and we immediately proceeded to join him
<PB N="381" REF="030274_1212_0FE577A2A4968BF0">
at the entrance of the capital. We were all re|markably aukward and defective in making our fir&s;t &s;alutations; not having been accu&s;tomed to bowing and &s;craping, for at lea&s;t two years and an half. The commander received us in a mo&s;t engaging manner; but we had the mortification to di&s;cover, that he had almo&s;t wholly forgot the French language; &s;o that only Mr. Webber had the &s;atisfaction of conver&s;ing with him, as he &s;poke the German, which was his native tongue.</P>
<P>Major Behm was accompanied by Captain Shmelaff, the next in command, and another officer; the whole body of merchants attended al&s;o. We were conducted to the commander's hou&s;e, where we were politely and re&s;pectfully received by his lady; who had prepared tea and other refre&s;hments for us. The fir&s;t compliments being over, Captain <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ore de&s;ired Mr. Webber to acquaint the Major, that we were di&s;tre&s;&s;ed for want of naval &s;tores, fre&s;h provi&s;ions, flour, and other nece&s;&s;aries; and that we were convinced we could not receive much a&s;&s;i&s;tance from him, in the country about Awat&s;ka Bay, from what we had already &s;een and heard; that the impo&s;|&s;ibility of conveying heavy &s;tores over the penin|&s;ula, at that &s;ea&s;on, we were but too &s;en&s;ible of, from the difficulties we had encountered in our journey; and that we could not delay the pro&s;e|cution of our voyage, to wait for any material change. Here the Major interrupted Mr. Web|ber,
<PB N="382" REF="030274_1213_0FE577486BE0DD48">
by ob&s;erving, that he knew not what they were capable of doing; that he &s;hould not be&s;tow a thought upon the difficulties of &s;upplying our wants; he only wi&s;hed to know what articles we &s;tood in need of, and the time he could be allow|ed for procuring them. After expre&s;&s;ing our acknowledgments for his obliging conde&s;cen&s;ion, we pre&s;ented him an account of the naval &s;tores, cattle, and flour, we were directed to purcha&s;e; and informed him, that we intended to pro&s;e|cute our voyage about the 5th of June.</P>
<P>After this the conver&s;ation became more ge|neral, and it might naturally be &s;uppo&s;ed, that we were anxious to obtain &s;ome information re|&s;qecting our native country. Having been three years ab&s;ent, we entertained the mo&s;t flattering expectations, of receiving &s;ome intere&s;ting in|telligence from Major Behm: but we were great|ly di&s;appointed, when he a&s;&s;ured us, that he could not communicate any intelligence of a much later date than that of our quitting&punc; Eng|land. The commander, &s;uppo&s;ing we might be fatigued, and de&s;irous of repo&s;e, begged leave to conduct us to our lodgings, at about &s;even o'clock. It was u&s;ele&s;s to prote&s;t again&s;t a com|pliment, to which we had no other title than that of being &s;trangers. That alone, with this gene|rous Livonian, was &s;ufficient to counterbalance every other con&s;ideration. In going along, we pa&s;&s;ed two guard-hou&s;es, where the men were
<PB N="383" REF="030274_1214_0FE577A61C9F6C50">
under arms in compliment to Captain Gore, and w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">re conducted to a neat decent hou&s;e, which the Major had appointed for our re&s;idence, while we continued at Kamt&s;chatka. We had two &s;en|tinels po&s;ted at our door, and a &s;erjeant's guard in an adjoining hou&s;e. Having di&s;po&s;ed of us in our apartments, the Major took his leave, pro|mi&s;ing to vi&s;it us the next day. We were now at lei&s;ure to di&s;cover the conveniences which he had amply provided for us. Our fellow-travel|ler, Mr. Port, and a &s;oldier, of a rank between that of a &s;erjeant and a corporal, (called a <HI>pul|proper&s;ckaek</HI>) were fixed upon to be our male do|me&s;tics. We had al&s;o a hou&s;ekeeper, and a cook, who were ordered to obey Mr. Port's directions in dre&s;&s;ing us a &s;upper, after the Engli&s;h mode of cookery. In the cour&s;e of the evening, we were favoured with a number of civil me&s;&s;ages, from the principal inhabitants of the town, po|litely ob&s;erving, that their attending to pay their re&s;pects to us at that time, would add to our fa|tigues, but they would do them&s;elves that honour the next morning. Such attention and polite|ne&s;s, in &s;o uncultivated and de&s;olate a country, formed a contra&s;t highly in favour of its inhabi|tants; and, in addition to their civility, at &s;un|&s;et, the &s;erjeant brought the report of his guard to Captain Gore.</P>
<P>In the morning of the 13th, compliments were &s;ent us by the Major, Captain Shmelaff, and the
<PB N="384" REF="030274_1215_0FE577740FA6C278">
mo&s;t re&s;pectable people of the town, from all whom we were honoured with vi&s;its &s;oon after. The two former having, after we had retired to re&s;t, enquired of Mr. Port what articles we &s;tood in the greate&s;t need of on board the &s;hips; they in&s;i&s;ted on our &s;haring with their garri&s;on, in the &s;mall &s;tock of provi&s;ions they had then remain|ing; lamenting, at the &s;ame time, that our ar|rival, &s;hould happen to be in that &s;ea&s;on of the year, when &s;carcity reigned univer&s;ally among them; the &s;loops from Okot&s;k not being yet ar|rived with their annual &s;upply.</P>
<P>We thankfully accepted the liberal offer of the&s;e ho&s;pitable &s;trangers; on condition, how|ever, that we &s;hould be made acquainted with the price of the articles we received from them, that Captain Clerke might draw upon the Victu|alling Office, in London, for the amount. This was refu&s;ed, in the mo&s;t po&s;itive terms; and, though repeatedly urged, the Major always &s;top|ped us &s;hort, by &s;aying, that his mi&s;tre&s;s would be highly gratified at his rendering every a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance in his power to the Engli&s;h, who are her good friends and allies; and that it would give her a peculiar &s;atisfaction to find, that, in &s;uch remote regions, her dominions had afforded any relief to ve&s;&s;els engaged in &s;uch important &s;er|vices. He added, that he could not, therefore, act &s;o contrary to the principles of his Empre&s;s, as to think of receiving any bills; but if we
<PB N="385" REF="030274_1216_0FE57775ED54BC80">
in&s;i&s;ted on it, we might give him a bare certifi|cate of the articles he might &s;upply us with, which he would tran&s;mit to the court of Ru&s;&s;ia, as evidence of having performed his duty.. All farther acknowledgments, continued he, mu&s;t be &s;ubmitted to the two courts, but you mu&s;t ex|cu&s;e me from acceding to your propo&s;al.</P>
<P>This matter being adju&s;ted, he reque&s;ted to be informed re&s;pecting our private wants, &s;aying he &s;hould con&s;ider it as offering him an affront, if we applied to any of the merchants, or had dealing with any other per&s;on except him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Not being able to make an adequate return for &s;uch &s;ingular genero&s;ity, he had only our thanks and admiration. At this moment, Mr. King re|collected, that Captain Clerke had &s;ent by him a &s;et of the engravings to Captain Cook's &s;econd voyage, de&s;iring him to pre&s;ent it, in his name, to the commander. Nothing could have been more acceptable to him than this pre&s;ent, the Major being an enthu&s;ia&s;t in all matters relative to di&s;coveries. Captain Clerke had al&s;o given Mr. King a di&s;cretionary power, of permitting the commander to &s;ee a chart of the di&s;coveries made in the pre&s;ent voyage; and judging from his &s;ituation and di&s;po&s;ition of mind, that he would be highly gratified by &s;uch a communica|tion; though, from motives of delicacy, he had only a&s;ked a few general que&s;tions on the &s;ubject&punc;
<PB N="386" REF="030274_1217_0FE577689283CEA0">
Mr. King repo&s;ed in him that confidence, which his whole conduct &s;o ju&s;tly merited.</P>
<P>He felt this compliment as it was intended he &s;hould; and was &s;truck at beholding, in one view, the whole of that coa&s;t on the &s;ide of A&s;ia and America, which his countrymen had been &s;o long employed in acquiring an imperfect knowledge of.</P>
<P>Except this mark of confidence, and the &s;et of copper-plates already mentioned, we had no|thing with us de&s;erving of his acceptance; for it was hardly worth noticing, that Mr. King pre|vailed on his &s;on (who was quite a youth) to ac|cept of a &s;ilver watch; and contributed to his little daugter's happine&s;s, by pre&s;enting her with two pair of ear-rings, of French pa&s;te. He al&s;o gave Captain Shmaleff the thermometer which he had u&s;ed on his journey, when he engaged to keep a regi&s;ter of the temperature of the air for one whole year, and to tran&s;mit it to Mr. Mul|ler, with whom he was acquainted.</P>
<P>This day we dined at the commander's, who, ever &s;tudious to gratify our curio&s;ity, had prepared a variety of di&s;hes dre&s;&s;ed after the Ru&s;&s;ian and Kamt&s;chadale manner, be&s;ides a number of others in the Engli&s;h &s;tyle. In the afternoon, we took a &s;urvey of the town, and the adjacent country. The &s;ituation of Bolcheret&s;k is in a low &s;wampy plain, extending to the &s;ea of Okot&s;k, being about forty miles in length, and of a con&s;iderable breadth. It lies north of the Bolchoi-reka (or
<PB N="387" REF="030274_1218_0FE5775B02F10958">
great river) and on a penin&s;ula, which has been &s;eparated from the continent by a large canal, under the directions of the pre&s;ent commander; which has added &s;trength to it as a fortre&s;s, and rendered it much le&s;s &s;ubject to inundations. The depth of the river, below the town, is from &s;ix to eight feet, and the breadth about a quar|ter of a mile. At the di&s;tance of twenty-two miles, it empties it&s;elf into the &s;ea of Okot&s;k; where it is capable of admitting pretty large ve&s;|&s;els. No corn, of any kind, is cultivated in this part of the country; and the Major a&s;&s;ured us, that his was the only garden that had been plant|ed. In general, the earth was covered with &s;now: the parts which were free from it, were full of black turfy hillocks. We &s;aw about twenty or thirty cows; and the commander had &s;ix good hor&s;es. The&s;e, and their dogs, are there only tame animals: being obliged to keep a great number of the latter, they can rear only &s;uch cat|tle as are a match for them in &s;trength and &s;ize. For, during the whole of the &s;ummer &s;ea&s;on, the dogs are turned loo&s;e, to provide entirely for them&s;elves; and are &s;ometimes &s;o ravenous, that they will even venture to attack the bullocks.</P>
<P>The buildings in Bolcheret&s;k are all in the &s;ame &s;tyle; they con&s;i&s;t of logs of wood, and are thatched. The Major's hou&s;e is con&s;iderably larger than the re&s;t, and has there capacious rooms neatly papered; but the <HI>talc,</HI> which co|vered
<PB N="388" REF="030274_1219_0FE5778B93465B50">
the windows, gave them a di&s;agreeable and mean appearance. The town con&s;i&s;t of low buildings, in rows of five or &s;ix habitations each, connected together by a pa&s;&s;age extending the whole length of them; having the kitchen and &s;tore-hou&s;e on one &s;ide, and the dwelling apart|ments on the other. There are al&s;o barracks for the Ru&s;&s;ian &s;oldiers and Co&s;&s;acks; a tolerable church; a court-room; and, at the end of the town, a number of <HI>Balagans.</HI> The number of the inhabitants is between five or &s;ix hundred. A hand&s;ome entertainment was given by the Ma|jor, in the evening, to which were invited all the re&s;pectable inhabitants of both &s;exes.</P>
<P>We made a private application, the next day, to Fedo&s;itch, the merchant, in order to purcha&s;e &s;ome tobacco; the &s;ailors having been without that favourite commodity for upwards of a year. This however, like other &s;imilar tran&s;actions, came immediately to the knowledge of the com|mander; and, in a very &s;hort time after, we were &s;urpri&s;ed to find four bags of tobacco in our hou&s;e, each containing upwards of a hundred pounds; which the Major reque&s;ted might be pre&s;ented to our &s;ailors, in his name, and that of the garri&s;on under his command. By the &s;ame conveyance, we received twenty loaves of &s;ugar, and as many pounds of tea, which they reque&s;t|ed the officers to accept of; as they under&s;tood that we were almo&s;t de&s;titute of tho&s;e articles. A
<PB N="389" REF="030274_1220_0FE5777F1E9D8A28">
pre&s;ent was al&s;o &s;ent by Madame Behm, for Cap|tain Clerke, which con&s;i&s;ted of honey, butter, figs, rice, and other articles; accompanied with her be&s;t wi&s;hes, that in his infirm &s;tate, they might prove &s;erviceable to him. We &s;trenuou&s;ly endeavoured to oppo&s;e this profu&s;ion of bounty, and were extremely anxious to re&s;train it; fully convinced that they were giving us almo&s;t the whole &s;tock of their garri&s;on. But the an&s;wer we received from the Major, on the&s;e occa&s;ions, generally was, That he had been in di&s;tre&s;s him|&s;elf, and he was &s;en&s;ible that we mu&s;t now be in that &s;ituation. The length of time, indeed, &s;ince we had touched at any known port, appeared to them almo&s;t incredible, and &s;eemed to require the evidence of our maps, and other concurrent circum&s;tances, to obtain their credit. Among the latter, we &s;hall mention a curious fact, which Major Behm related to us this morning, and which he &s;aid he &s;hould not have known how to account for, but for our arrival.</P>
<P>Among the people of the north of A&s;ia, it is well known, that the T&s;chut&s;ki only have main|tained their independence, and re&s;i&s;ted all the ef|forts of the Ru&s;&s;ians to reduce them. The la&s;t attempt was in 1750, and after variety of tempo|rary advantages on each &s;ide, the Ru&s;&s;ian forces retreated, after having lo&s;t their commanding of|ficer. The Ru&s;&s;ians afterwards removed their frontier frotre&s;s, from the Anadyr to the Ingiga
<PB N="390" REF="030274_1221_0FE5775C895319A8">
a river which runs into the northern extremity of the &s;ea of Okot&s;k, and gives its name to a gulph, we&s;t of that of Pen&s;hin&s;k. On the day of our ar|rival at Bolecheret&s;k, the Major had received di&s;|patches from this fort, acquainting him, that a party of the T&s;chut&s;ki had arrived there, with vo|luntary offers of friend&s;hip and a tribute. That, on a&s;king the cau&s;e of &s;o unexpected an alteration in their &s;entiments, they had acquainted his peo|ple, that two large Ru&s;&s;ian boats had vi&s;ited them, towards the end of the preceding &s;ummer: that they had been &s;hewn the greate&s;t kindne&s;s by the people who were in them, and had entered into a league of amity with them; and that, in con|&s;equence of this, they came to the Ru&s;&s;ian fort, in order to &s;ettle a treaty upon terms agreeable to both nations. This remakable tale had given ri&s;e to much &s;peculation, both at Ingigin&s;k and Bolcheret&s;k; and mu&s;t have remained utterly un|intelligible, had it not been elucidated by us. It was no &s;mall &s;atisfaction to us, to have thus &s;hewn the Ru&s;&s;ians, even by accident, the be&s;t method of collecting tribute, and extending their domi|nions; in hopes that the good under&s;tanding, which this event has produced, may re&s;cue a brave people from &s;uch powerful invaders.</P>
<P>We were this day engaged to dine with Cap|tain Shmaleff, who in order to vary our amu&s;e|ments, entertained us with an exhibition of danc|ing, in the Ru&s;&s;ian and Kamt&s;chadale &s;tyle. It
<PB N="391" REF="030274_1222_0FE57780A5B405F8">
is impo&s;&s;ible to convey an adequate idea of this uncouth exhibition. The figure of the Ru&s;&s;ian dance, re&s;embled tho&s;e of our hornpipes, and con&s;i&s;ted of one, two, or four performers at a time. Their &s;teps were exceedingly &s;hort and quick, their feet being rai&s;ed but a very little way from the ground; their arms were hung down clo&s;e to the &s;ides, the body being kept, the whole time, erect and immoveable, except when the performers pa&s;&s;ed each other, when the hand was &s;uddenly rai&s;ed with an awkward motion. But, if the Ru&s;&s;ian dance was unmeaning and ridicu|lous, the Kamt&s;chadale was infinitely more &s;o. The principle aim, in their performances, is to repre&s;ent the clum&s;y ge&s;tures of the bear, which the inhabitants of this country have frequent op|portunities of ob&s;erving in various &s;ituations. To de&s;cribe the awkward po&s;tures, exhibited on the&s;e occa&s;ions, would appear tedious and unintere&s;t|ing. In general, however, the body was bowed, and the knees bent, whil&s;t the arms were employ|ed in imitating the motions of that awkward animal.</P>
<P>Having &s;pent much time in our journey to Bolcheret&s;k, and being informed that our return might, perhaps, be more difficult and tedious we were obliged to acquaint the Major, this even|ing with our intention of departing the next day. We could not think of leaving our new acquaint|ance without regret; and were agreeably &s;urpri&s;ed,
<PB N="392" REF="030274_1223_0FE5774B82640F80">
when the Major promi&s;ed to accompany us, if we would &s;tay but one day longer. He told us, that he had made up his di&s;patches, and re&s;igned the command of Kamt&s;chatka to Captain Shmaleff; having made the nece&s;&s;ary preparations for his departure to Okot&s;k, which was &s;hortly to take place; but that he &s;hould be happy in po&s;tponing his journey, and at<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">nding us to St. Peter and St. Paul's, in order to be &s;atisfied, that nothing which could be done to &s;erve us, &s;hould be omitted.</P>
<P>For the articles which Mr. King had given to the Major's children, he received, the next morn|ing, a mo&s;t magnificent Kamt&s;chadale dre&s;s, &s;uch as the principal <HI>Toions</HI> wear on the mo&s;t &s;olemn occa&s;ions. This habit, as we are informed by Fedo&s;itch, mu&s;t have co&s;t, at lea&s;t, one hundred and twenty roubles. He al&s;o at the &s;ame time, was pre&s;ented with a hand&s;ome &s;able muff, as a pre&s;ent from his daughter.</P>
<P>We dined this day (the 15th) with the com|mander, who, willing to give us an opportunity of &s;eeing as much as we could of the manners and cu&s;toms of the country, invited all the principal inhabitants of the town, to his hou&s;e this even|ing. The dre&s;&s;es of the women were &s;plendid after the Kamt&s;chadale manner. Captain Shma|leff's lady, and the wives of the other officers of the garri&s;on, were dre&s;&s;ed in a pretty ta&s;te, partly in the Siberian, and partly in the European mode. Madame Behm, in particular, appeared in a grand
<PB N="393" REF="030274_1224_0FE577829A32E8C0">
European dre&s;s. The richne&s;s and variety of the &s;ilks worn by the women, as well as the &s;ingula|rity of their dre&s;s, was very &s;triking: and the whole had the air of &s;ome enchanted &s;cene, in the mid&s;t of the mo&s;t de&s;ert and dreary country in the univer&s;e. The entertainments of this night were dancing and &s;inging.</P>
<P>As we had fixed upon the next morning for our departure, we retired early to our apart|ments, where three travelling dre&s;&s;es pre&s;ented them&s;elves to our view, made after the Kamt&s;|chadale mode, which had been provided for us by the commander. He came to us him&s;elf &s;oon after, to &s;ee that proper care was taken in pack|ing up our things. We had, indeed, no incon|&s;iderable load of baggage; for exclu&s;ive of his liberal pre&s;ents, Captain Shmaleff, and &s;everal other individuals, &s;hewed us many in&s;tances of kindne&s;s and genero&s;ity.</P>
<P>On Sunday, the 16th, early in the morning, we were preparing for our departure, when we were invited to take our leave of Madame Behm, in our pa&s;&s;age to the boats. Already impre&s;&s;ed with &s;entiments of the warme&s;t gratitude, for the benevolent and generous treatment we had re|ceived at Bolcheret&s;k, they were much heightened by the effecting &s;cene which followed. On quit|ing our apartments, we &s;aw all the &s;oldiers and co&s;&s;acks of the garri&s;on drawn up on one &s;ide, and, on the other, were all the male inhabitants
<PB N="394" REF="030274_1225_0FE577636B12E2D0">
of the town, in their be&s;t clothing; the whole body of the people joining in a melancholy &s;ong, which, we were informed, it was u&s;ual to &s;ing on the departure of friends. Thus we marched till we arrived at the commander's hou&s;e, preceded by the drums and mu&s;ic belonging to the gar|ri&s;on. Here we were received by Madame Behm, accompanied by &s;everal ladies, habited in long &s;ilk cloaks, lined with furs of various colours: forming a mo&s;t &s;plendid appearance. Having partook of &s;ome refre&s;hment which had been pro|vided for us, we proceeded to the water-&s;ide, at|tended by the ladies, who joined with the re&s;t of the people in the &s;ong; and, having taken leave of Madame Behm, after a&s;&s;uring her that the &s;en&s;e of the ho&s;pitality of Bolcheret&s;k, would be indelible in our hearts, we were two much af|fected not to ha&s;ten into the boats. At putting off, we received three cheers, which we immedi|ately returned; and, on doubling a point, where we la&s;t beheld our friendly entertainers, they &s;till added to our feelings, by a farewell cheer!</P>
<P>On our return, the &s;tream was &s;o exceedingly rapid, that, notwith&s;tanding the utmo&s;t exertions of our conductors, we did not arrive at the fir&s;t village, Opatchin, till the 17th in the evening, which did not exceed the rate of twenty miles a day. On the 19th, we reached Natcheekin, and cro&s;&s;ed the plain to Karatchin on the 20th. The road was in much better order than when
<PB N="395" REF="030274_1226_0FE5776506246EF8">
we pa&s;&s;ed it before, as it froze &s;martly in the night of the 19th. We proceeded down the Awat&s;ka river on the 21&s;t, and pa&s;&s;ed over the &s;hoals, at the entrance of the bay, before it was dark. Dur|ing the whole of our journey, we were highly plea&s;ed with the willingne&s;s and alacrity, with which the <HI>Toions</HI> and their Kamt&s;chadales a&s;&s;i&s;ted us at the different <HI>o&s;trogs.</HI> On &s;eeing the Major, joy appeared in every countenance; and they were much affected upon being informed that he would &s;hortly leave them.</P>
<P>A me&s;&s;enger had been di&s;patched from Bol|cheret&s;k to Captain Clerke, acquainting him with the nature of our reception; and that the Major intended to accompany us on our return; ap|prizing him, at the &s;ame time, of the day he might expect us. We ob&s;erved, with plea&s;ure, as we approached the harbour, all our boats coming towards us. The men were all clean, and the officers as well arrayed as their ward|robes would then permit them to be. The Major was &s;truck at the healthly appearance of our &s;ailors, and was &s;urprized to &s;ee that many of them had no other covering than a &s;hirt and trow&s;ers, though it actually &s;nowed at that very in&s;tant.</P>
<P>Major Behm had expre&s;&s;ed an inclination to vi&s;it the &s;hips before he landed; but, being in|formed that Captain Clerke was extremely ill, he thought it would be improper to di&s;turb him at
<PB N="396" REF="030274_1227_0FE548DECADB4C00">
&s;o late an hour; it being then after nine o'clock. Mr. King therefore attended him to the &s;erjeant's hou&s;e, and afterwards went on board to commu|nicate to Captain Clerke what had happened at Bolcheret&s;k. He was much concerned to find that, during his ab&s;ence, that officer's health was con&s;iderably impaired; in&s;tead of growing better, as we flattered our&s;elves it might, from undi&s;|turbed repo&s;e in the harbour, and a milk and ve|getable diet.</P>
<P>The next morning, Mr. King conducted the Major to the &s;hips; where he was received with every po&s;&s;ible mark of di&s;tinction, and &s;aluted with thirteen guns. He was attended by the comman|der of a Ru&s;&s;ian galliot, two merchants from Bol|cheret&s;k, a ma&s;ter of a &s;loop, and the prie&s;t of the village of Paratounca.</P>
<P>Having vi&s;ited the captain, and taken a view of the two &s;hips, he returned to dine on board the Re&s;olution. In the cour&s;e of the afternoon, the curio&s;ities which we had collected were &s;hewn him, and an a&s;&s;ortment of each article pre&s;ented to him by Captain Clerke. Here we cannot &s;uppre&s;s an in&s;tance of great genero&s;ity and gra|titude in our &s;ailors; who, being informed of the hand&s;ome pre&s;ent which had been made them by the Major, voluntarily reque&s;ted that their grog might be withheld, and their allowance of &s;pirits pre&s;ented to the garri&s;on of Bolcheret&s;k; &s;aying they knew brandy was extremely &s;carce in that
<PB N="397" REF="030274_1228_0FE5773747C24460">
country, the &s;oldiers on &s;hore having offered four roubles a bottle for it. We could not but admire this extraordinary &s;acrifice, knowing how much the &s;ailors felt, when abridged or deprived of their grog. Indeed, they never had that article withheld from them but in warm weather, that they might enjoy a greater proportion when it was mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary; but this generous propo&s;al would deprive them of it, even in the inclement &s;ea&s;on we had naturally to expect in our northern expedition. The officers, however, would not permit them to &s;uffer by their genero&s;ity, and &s;ub&s;tituted, in the room of the &s;mall quantity of brandy, which the Major con&s;ented to accept, an equal quantity of rum. A dozen or two of Cape wine for Madame Behm, and &s;ome other trifling pre&s;ents which we were enabled to make, were accepted with great politene&s;s. The tobacco was di&s;tributed the next morning, among the crews of both ve&s;&s;els; every man that chewed or &s;moked tobacco being allowed three pounds, and the others only one.</P>
<P>It has been ob&s;erved that the Major had re|&s;igned the command of Kamt&s;chatka, and was &s;peedily to repair to Peter&s;burgh; and he now expre&s;&s;ed his willingne&s;s to convey any di&s;patches we might chu&s;e to commit to his care. Such an opportunity was not to be neglected; and Cap|tain Clerke reque&s;ted him to take the charge of &s;ome papers relative to our voyage, to the Briti&s;h
<PB N="398" REF="030274_1229_0FE57811EE3DB138">
Amba&s;&s;ador at the Ru&s;&s;ian court. At fir&s;t, we intended to tran&s;mit only a conci&s;e journal of our proceedings; but, after mature con&s;ideration, Captain Clerke was of opinion, that the whole account of our di&s;coveries might &s;afely be com|mitted to the care of a man, who had given the &s;tronge&s;t proofs of probity and virtue. Con&s;ider|ing al&s;o, that a very hazardous part of the voyage was &s;till to be performed, he re&s;olved to &s;end, by him, the whole of Captain Cook's journal; together with his own, from the death of that commander, till our arrival at Kamt&s;chatka; and al&s;o a chart of our di&s;coveries. Mr. Bayly and Mr. King al&s;o determined to &s;end an account of our proceedings to the board of longitude. From the&s;e precautions, had any accident befallen us, the Admiralty would have become po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the principal facts of our voyage. It was farther re&s;olved, that a &s;maller packet &s;hould be di&s;patched from Okot&s;k, which the Major &s;up|po&s;ed would reach Peter&s;burgh by December; and that he expected to arrive there him&s;elf in February or March.</P>
<P>The Major was entertained alternately in the two &s;hips, as well as we were able, the three fol|lowing days. He departed on the 25th, and was &s;aluted with thirteen guns; the &s;ailors, at their own reque&s;t, expre&s;&s;ing their regard for him by three cheers. Mr. King and Mr. Webber attend|ed him, the next morning, &s;ome few miles up
<PB N="399" REF="030274_1230_0FE5776DD1BEA9E0">
the Awat&s;ka river, where the Ru&s;&s;ian prie&s;t and his family were waiting to bid a la&s;t adieu to their commander.</P>
<P>On taking our leave of the Major, it is diffi|cult to &s;ay, whether the worthy prie&s;t and his family or our&s;elves were mo&s;t affected. Though our acquaintance had been of &s;hort duration, his behaviour had in&s;pired us with the highe&s;t e&s;teem for him; and we could not part (perhaps for ever) with one, to whom we were under &s;uch in|finite obligations, without indulging the mo&s;t tender feelings. Exclu&s;ive of the &s;tores, which might probably be carried to a public account, the value of the private pre&s;ents he be&s;towed on us, mu&s;t have amounted to upwards of two hun|dred pounds. But, however extraordinary this genero&s;ity may appear, it was exceeded by his delicacy in conferring favours, and his ingenious endeavours to prevent our feeling the weight of obligations, which he knew we were unable to requite. In &s;upporting a public character, and maintaining the honour of his &s;overeign, he is &s;till more entitled to our admiration, as he was actuated by &s;entiments the mo&s;t noble and enlarged. The &s;ervice in which we were engaged, he told us, was for the general benefit of mankind; and en|titled us to the offices of humanity, and the pri|vileges of citizens, in whatever country we might be driven. That by affording us &s;uch relief as was in his power, he was certain that he was acting
<PB N="400" REF="030274_1231_0FE5773E8A7231C0">
agreeably to the wi&s;hes of his empre&s;s; and that h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> could not &s;o entirely forget her character, or his own honour, as to barter for the performance of a duty. Among other things, he &s;aid, he made a particular point of &s;etting a good example to the Kamt&s;chadales, who were ju&s;t emerging from a &s;tate of barbari&s;m; that they con&s;idered the Ru&s;&s;ians as their patterns, in every re&s;pect; and that he hoped, they would in future, think it a duty incumbent on them to render &s;trangers every a&s;&s;i&s;tance in their power, and believe it to be the univer&s;al practice of all poli&s;hed and civi|lized nations.</P>
<P>The Major, having &s;o far as he was capable, relieved our pre&s;ent di&s;tre&s;&s;es, he was not unmind|ful of our future wants; and imagining we &s;hould not be able to di&s;cover the pa&s;&s;age we were in &s;earch of, and that we &s;hould return to Kamt&s;|chatka; he procured from Captain Clerke, the particulars of what flour and cordage he &s;hould want, promi&s;ing to &s;end them from Okot&s;k, to wait our arrival. He al&s;o pre&s;ented the Captain with a written paper, enjoining every Ru&s;&s;ian &s;ubject to a&s;&s;i&s;t us to the utmo&s;t of their abilities.</P>

<HEAD>LIFE OF CAPTAIN JAMES COOK.</HEAD>
<P>WITH AN ELEGANT PORTRAIT.</P>
<P>CAPTAIN JAMES COOK, eminently di&s;tin|gui&s;hed as a navigator, was born at Mar|ton, a &s;mall village in the North Riding of York|&s;hire, di&s;tant about &s;ix miles from Stockton upon Tees, on the 27th of October 1728. His father, who&s;e name was al&s;o James, and who, from his dialect, was &s;uppo&s;ed to be a Northumbrian, lived in the humble &s;tation of a farmer's &s;ervant; he married a woman of the &s;ame rank with him&s;elf, and they were both noted in their neighbourhood for their hone&s;ty, &s;obriety and indu&s;try. Young Cook received the fir&s;t rudiments of his education at the place in which he was born, from the &s;chool|mi&s;tre&s;s of the village; but his father in con&s;e|quence of the character he had obtained for dili|gence and &s;kill in his profe&s;&s;ion, having been ap|pointed bailiff, on a farm belonging to the late
<PB N="2" REF="030274_1233_0FE577B3857EE028">
Thomas Scottow, E&s;q. called Airy Holme, he removed thither with his family, and his &s;on James, being then about eight years of age, was, at Mr. Scottow's expence, put to a day &s;chool in Ayton, where he was in&s;tructed in writing and the principles of arithmetic.</P>
<P>Before he had attained to the age of thirteen, he was bound apprentice to a &s;hopkeeper at Staiths, a fi&s;hing town, ten miles north of Whitby; but as he had a &s;trong inclination for a &s;ea-faring life, and as his pa&s;&s;ion for it was, perhaps, &s;trengthened by the opportunities he had of frequenting the company of tho&s;e employed in that line, on &s;ome quarrel between him and his ma&s;ter, he obtained his di&s;charge, and &s;oon after bound him&s;elf, for &s;even years, to Me&s;&s;rs. J. and H. Walker of Whitby, who were Quakers, and principal own|ers of two &s;hips con&s;tantly employed in the coal trade. After the expiration of his time, he con|tinued to &s;erve, in the coal and other branches of trade, as a common &s;ailor, till he was at length promoted to be mate of one of Mr. J. Walker's &s;hips. During this period, nothing very &s;triking appeared either in his character or conduct; nor did he exhibit any marks of tho&s;e &s;uperior abili|ties, which have done &s;o much honour to the Bri|ti&s;h nation, which give him a title to be ranked among&s;t the mo&s;t celebrated navigators, and which will render his name immortal.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="030274_1234_0FE577BC24DAC8B0">In the &s;pring of the year 1755, ho&s;tilities com|menced between Great Britain and France. As an order had been i&s;&s;ued from the Admiralty for impre&s;&s;ing &s;eamen, Mr. Cook, who was then in the river with his &s;hip, afraid of being pre&s;&s;ed, re|&s;olved if po&s;&s;ible to conceal him&s;elf, but con&s;ider|ing afterwards, that this might be difficult, if not impo&s;&s;ible, he thought it would be be&s;t to enter voluntarily into his Maje&s;ty's &s;ervice, and to try his fortune in the Royal Navy. In pur&s;uance of this de&s;ign, he repaired to a hou&s;e of rendezvous at Wapping, and entered with an officer belong|ing to the Eagle, a &s;hip of &s;ixty guns, at that time commanded by Captain Hamer. To this &s;hip, Captain, now Sir Hugh Palli&s;er, being appointed in the month of October 1755, Cook's d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ligence, and his attention to the duties of his profe&s;&s;ion, did not e&s;cape his notice; he &s;oon di&s;tingui&s;hed him to be an able and active &s;eaman, and as all the officers were unanimous i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> opinion re&s;pecting him, and &s;poke highly in his favor, the Captain gave him every encouragement which he po&s;&s;ibly could.</P>
<P>Some time after this period, Mr. O&s;balde&s;ton, then Member of Parliament for Scarborough, hav|ing been &s;olicited by &s;ome of his neighbours, who had heard of Cook's merit, and the notice taken of him by his Captain and officers, wrote a lette<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> in his favor to Captain Palli&s;er, reque&s;ting he would point out in what manner they could con|tribute
<PB N="4" REF="030274_1235_0FE577B8ABEB87C0">
towards his promotion. The Captain, in his reply, did full ju&s;tice to Cook's character, but he informed Mr. O&s;balde&s;ton, that as he had been only a &s;hort while in the Navy, he could not be appointed a commi&s;&s;ioned officer; adding that a Ma&s;ter's warrant, might, perhaps, be procured for him, by which he would be placed in a &s;ituation &s;uited to his talents, and in which he had no doubt, he would di&s;charge his duty with credit to him&s;elf, and with honour to tho&s;e who patroni&s;ed him.</P>
<P>On the 10th of May, 1759, he obtained a Ma&s;|ter's Warrant for the Grampus &s;loop; but this ap|pointment did not take place, as the proper Ma&s;|ter of that ve&s;&s;el unexpectedly returned. Four days after, he was made Ma&s;ter of the Garland; but here again he was di&s;appointed, for, upon en|quiry, it was found, that he could not join the &s;hip, as &s;he had failed &s;ome days before: however, on the 15th of May, he was appointed to the Mercury, which was de&s;tined for North-America, to join the fleet under the command of Sir Charles Saunders, who, in conjunction with General Wolf, was then engaged in the &s;iege of Quebec. Dur|ing that memorable &s;iege, it was found nece&s;&s;ary to take &s;oundings in the channel of the river St. Lawrence, directly oppo&s;ite to the French camp at Montmorency and Beauport, in order that the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">dmiral might be enabled to lay his &s;hips before the enemies batteries, and to cover the Briti&s;h army, in an attack which the General intended to make
<PB N="5" REF="030274_1236_0FE577C3F354A000">
on the French camp. As this was a dangerous and difficult &s;ervice, and as Cook's &s;agacity and re&s;olution were now well known, Captain Palli&s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> recommended him as a proper per&s;on to undertake it, and in this choice he was not di&s;appointed; for Cook performed it in the complete&s;t manner, and to the full &s;atisfaction of his employers. He did not, however, effect his purpo&s;e without great ri&s;k: having been engaged in this bu&s;ine&s;s during night, for &s;everal nights &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, he was at length di&s;covered by the enemy, who &s;ent a num|ber of canoes filled with Indians, to &s;urround him, and he had no alternative, but to make for &s;hore on the i&s;land of Orleans, near the guard of the Engli&s;h ho&s;pital, to which he was &s;o clo&s;ely pur|&s;ued, that he had &s;carcely leaped from the bow of the boat, which belonging to one of the &s;hips of war when the Indians entered it by the &s;tern, and having taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, carried it off in tri|umph. There is rea&s;on to believe, that before this period, Cook had &s;carcely u&s;ed a pencil, and was entirely unacquainted with drawing; but &s;uch were the powers of his mind, and his aptitude for acquiring knowledge, that he &s;oon made him|&s;elf ma&s;ter of every object to which he applied, and notwith&s;tanding the di&s;advantages under which he labored, he furni&s;hed the Admiral with as com|plete a draught of the channel and &s;oundings as could have been made by the mo&s;t expert &s;urveyor in the time of profound peace.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="030274_1237_0FE577BA9F9ACE18">Another important &s;ervice which our naviga|tor performed while on the American &s;tation, does no le&s;s honour to his memory, and de&s;erves al&s;o to be mentioned. The navigation of the ri|ver St. Lawrence is both difficult and dangerous, and was particularly &s;o then to the Engli&s;h, who were not well acquainted with that part of North America, and who had no chart, on the correct|ne&s;s of which they could depend. The Admiral, therefore, who had received &s;o favorable a &s;peci|men of Mr. Cook's abilities, appointed him to &s;ur|vey tho&s;e parts of the river below Quebec which navigators accounted to be mo&s;t dangerous, and this bu&s;ine&s;s he executed with the &s;ame diligence, activity and &s;kill, as he had di&s;played on the for|mer occa&s;ion. When he had completed his chart of the river it was publi&s;hed, with &s;oundings and directions for &s;ailing in it, and &s;o great was its accuracy, that it hath never &s;ince been found ne|ce&s;&s;ary to publi&s;h another.</P>
<P>After the expedition to Quebec, Mr. Cook, by a warrant from Lord Colvill, was appointed Ma&s;|ter of the Northumberland, on the 22d of Sep|tember 1759. In this &s;hip his lord&s;hip &s;taid the following winter, as Commodore, at Hali<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ax, and Cook's behavior in his new &s;tation did not fail to gain him the friend&s;hip and e&s;teem of his com|mander. Sen&s;ible that he was now in the road to promotion, he &s;pent the lei&s;ure hours which the winter &s;ea&s;on gave him, in acquiring &s;uch branches
<PB N="7" REF="030274_1238_0FE577BE47B84D98">
of knowledge as might qualify him for future &s;er|vice. At Halifax he fir&s;t read Euclid, and &s;tudi|ed a&s;tronomy. The books he was able to procure were indeed few, but application and indu&s;try &s;upplied many deficiencies, and enabled him to make a progre&s;s &s;uperior to what could be expected from the advantages he enjoyed.</P>
<P>While Mr. Cook was Ma&s;ter of the Northum|berland, under Lord Colvill, that &s;hip came to Newfoundland in September, 1762, to a&s;&s;i&s;t in the recapture of the i&s;land. After that object was accompli&s;hed, the Engli&s;h fleet remained &s;ome days at Placentia, in order to put it in a better &s;tate of defence. During this time Mr. Cook had again an opportunity of di&s;playing his diligence, and manife&s;ting his zeal for the good of his Maje&s;ty's &s;ervice; he &s;urveyed the harbour and heights of that place, and by this attracted the notice of Cap|tain, afterwards Admiral Graves, who was at that time commander of the Antelope, and Governor of Newfoundland. The Governor, from this cir|cum&s;tance, having been induced to a&s;k him a num|ber of que&s;tions, his an&s;wers were &s;o &s;atisfactory, that he thence conceived a very favorable opinion of his abilities and nautical knowledge, and this was &s;till farther increa&s;ed by a longer acquaintance with him. Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of an active genius, &s;timu|lated, perhaps, by the &s;ucce&s;s which had attended his pa&s;t labors, and the hopes of promotion, Cook continued to di&s;play the mo&s;t unremitting a&s;&s;i|duity,
<PB N="8" REF="030274_1239_0FE57744323A5A48">
in order to make him&s;elf acquainted with the American coa&s;t, and to facilitate its navigation, while the e&s;teem which Captain Graves entertain for him was greatly heightened by the repeated te&s;|timonies of his good behaviour, given by all the officers under whom he had &s;erved.</P>
<P>In the latter end of the year 1762, Mr. Cook returned to England, and on the 21&s;t of Decem|ber he married, at Barking in E&s;&s;ex, a young la|dy of the name of Batts, whom he tenderly loved and who had every claim to his warme&s;t regard and affection; but his &s;ituation in life, and the high and important &s;ervices to which he was cal|led, did not &s;uffer him long to enjoy matrimonial felicity without interruption.</P>
<P>Peace being concluded in 1763 between En|gland, France, and Spain, Captain Graves was again &s;ent out as Governor of Newfoundland. As this country was con&s;idered to be of great va|lue in a commercial view, and as it had been the principal object of contention between the En|gli&s;h and the French, the Governor obtained, though with &s;ome difficulty, an e&s;tabli&s;hment for the &s;urvey of its coa&s;ts; and Mr. Cook, on the recommendation of Captain Graves, was ap|pointed to carry this plan into execution. He, therefore, went out with that gentleman, and having &s;urveyed the &s;mall i&s;lands of St. Pierre and Miquelon, which, by treaty, had been ceded to the French, and which they were &s;uffered to take
<PB N="9" REF="030274_1240_0FE577C583304CA8">
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of, after the bu&s;ine&s;s was fini&s;hed, he returned to England, towards the conclu&s;ion of the &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>In the beginning of the year following, he ac|companied his friend and patron Sir Hugh Palli&s;er, who was appointed Commodore and Governor of Labradore and Newfoundland, in the &s;ame &s;tation in which he had been under Captain Graves. For this employment Mr. Cook was well qualified, and the c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">rts of his &s;urveys, which he afterwards publi&s;hed, reflected the highe&s;t credit on his abili|ties. He explored the inland part of the i&s;land of Newfoundland, in a much more accurate manner than had ever been done before, and by penetrat|ing into the heart of the country di&s;covered &s;everal large lakes, the po&s;ition of which is di&s;tinctly mark|ed out in the general chart. It appears, that Mr. Cook was occa&s;ionally engaged in this &s;ervice, re|turning to England for the winter &s;ea&s;on, till the year 1767, which was the late&s;t period of his being employed as Marine Surveyor of Newfound|land. That he had by this time made a con&s;ide|rable knowledge in practical a&s;tronomy is evident, from a &s;hort paper written by him, which was in&s;erted in the fifty-&s;eventh volume of the Philo|&s;ophical Tran&s;actions, entitled <HI>An oh&s;ervation of an Eclip&s;e of the &s;un at the i&s;land of Newfoundland, Augu&s;t the</HI> 5<HI>th,</HI> 1766, <HI>with the longitude of the place of ob&s;ervation deduced from it.</HI> This ob&s;erva|tion was made at one of the Burgeo i&s;lands, near Cape Ray, in lat. 47&deg; 36&prime; 19&Prime;, on the &s;outh-we&s;t
<PB N="10" REF="030274_1241_0FE577FA1B3E80A8">
extremity of Newfoundland, and Mr. Cook's paper having been communicated to Mr&punc; Witchell, he compared it with an ob&s;ervation made on the &s;ame eclip&s;e by the Reverend Mr. Horn&s;by, and thence computed the difference of longitude of the places of ob&s;ervation making proper allowance for parallax, and the prolate &s;pheroidal figure of the earth. It appears from the Philo&s;ophical Tran&s;actions, that Cook was at this time accounted an able mathematician.</P>
<P>Though many di&s;coveries have been made at different periods, by Briti&s;h navigators, it was re|&s;erved for the pre&s;ent reign to carry the &s;pirit of enterprize to its utmo&s;t extent, and to direct it for the accompli&s;hment of the noble&s;t purpo&s;es. Soon after peace was concluded in 1763, two voyages round the world were undertaken, under the patronage of his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty, which were per|formed by Captains Byron, Wallis, and Cartaret, and before the two latter returned another was re|&s;olved upon, the principal object of which was the improvement of a&s;tronomy. It having been calculated, that the planet Venus would pa&s;s over the Sun's di&s;k in 1769, it was judged that the be&s;t place for ob&s;erving this phenomenon, would be either at the Marque&s;as, or at one of tho&s;e i&s;lands which Ta&s;man called Am&s;terdam, Rotterdam and Middleburgh, and which are now better known by the appellation of the Friendly I&s;les. This be|ing a matter of the greate&s;t importance to a&s;tro|nomy, the Royal Society, with a laudable zeal
<PB N="11" REF="030274_1242_0FE577C796537058">
for the advancement of that &s;cience, pre&s;ented a memorial to his Maje&s;ty, reque&s;ting among other things, that a ve&s;&s;el might be fitted out at the ex|pence of government, to convey proper per&s;ons to ob&s;erve the tran&s;it of Venus at one of the above mentioned places. This petition was readily com|plied with, and orders having been &s;ent to the Lords Commi&s;&s;ioners of the Admiralty to provide a ve&s;&s;el for that purpo&s;e, on the 3d of April Mr. Stephens informed the Society, that a bark had been taken up, and would be got ready with all convenient &s;peed.</P>
<P>The per&s;on originally fixed upon to conduct this expedition was Mr. Dalrymple, an eminent Member of the Royal Society, who had di&s;tingui&s;hed him|&s;elf by his enquiries re&s;pecting the geography of the &s;outhern ocean. Though this gentleman had not been regularly bred to the &s;ea, he in&s;i&s;ted upon hav|ing a brevet commi&s;&s;ion, as Captain of the ve&s;&s;el, before he &s;hould &s;et out. Sir Edward Hawke, who was then at the head of the Admiralty, violently oppo&s;ed this mea&s;ure, and being pre&s;&s;ed on the &s;ub|ject, declared, he would rather &s;uffer his right hand to be cut off than &s;ign &s;uch a commi&s;&s;ion. Both parties were inflexible; it was therefore found ne|ce&s;&s;ary to look out for &s;ome other per&s;on to conduct the expedition, and Mr. Stephens, Secretary to the Admiralty, having recommended Mr. Cook, and this recommendation being &s;trengthened by the te&s;timony of Sir Hugh Palli&s;er, who was well ac|quainted with his abilities and merit, he was ap|pointed
<PB N="12" REF="030274_1243_0FE57801A415D2D0">
to this important &s;ervice by the Lords Com|mi&s;&s;ioners, and promoted to the rank of Lieute|nant in the Royal Navy, on the 25th of May 1768.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as this appointment had taken place, Sir Hugh Palli&s;er was ordered to provide a ve&s;&s;el &s;uited for &s;uch a voyage. He examined a great many of tho&s;e which were then lying in the Thames, and with Mr. Cook's a&s;&s;i&s;tance of who&s;e judgment he entertained the highe&s;t opinion, he at length, fixed upon one of three hundred and &s;eventy tons burthen, which was afterwards named the Endea|vour.</P>
<P>Captain Wallis having returned from his voyage round the world while preparations were making for Cook's expedition, and that gentleman having &s;ignified to the Royal Society, that Port Royal har|bour, in King George's I&s;land, which he di&s;co|vered, and which is now known by the name of Otaheite, would be the mo&s;t convenient &s;ituation for ob&s;erving the tran&s;it, Captain Wallis's opinion was adopted, and orders were given to the ob&s;erv|ers to repair thither. Mr. Charles Green, who had been under Dr. Bradley, at the Royal Ob&s;er|vatory, at Greenwich, was appointed to a&s;&s;i&s;t Mr. Cook, in conducting the a&s;tronomical part of the voyage. He was accompanied al&s;o by Jo&s;eph Banks, E&s;q. now Sir Jo&s;eph Banks, Bart. and Dr. Solander, the former of whom, at an early period of life, and at a great expence to him&s;elf, embarked in this tedious and hazardous enterprize, with the noble&s;t of all views, that of promoting the cau&s;e
<PB N="13" REF="030274_1244_0FE577C987E85A60">
of &s;cience, and enlarging the knowledge of man|kind. Though the principal intention of this voy|age was to ob&s;erve the tran&s;it of Venus, it was thought proper, to make it comprehend other ob|jects al&s;o; Mr. Cook, therefore, was directed, after he had accompli&s;hed his main bu&s;ine&s;s, to proceed in making further di&s;coveries in the great Southern Seas. The complement of the Endeavour con&s;i&s;ted, be&s;ides the Commander, of eighty-four per&s;ons. She was victualled for eighteen months, and ten carriage and twelve &s;wivel guns were &s;ent on board of her, together with abundance of ammunition and all nece&s;&s;ary &s;tores.</P>
<P>The Endeavour being completely fitted for &s;ea, Mr. Cook &s;ailed from Deptford, on the 30th of July 1768, and on the 13th of Augu&s;t anchored in Plymouth Sound, from which, after a few days &s;tay, he proceeded to &s;ea, and reached Madeira on the 13th of September. Having laid in a fre&s;h &s;tock of beef, water and wine at this i&s;land, our navigator pur&s;ued his voyage; but on the 7th of November, finding that &s;everal articles of the &s;hip's provi&s;ions were likely to fall &s;hort, he determined to touch at Rio de Janeiro, where he had no doubt of meeting with a friendly reception. In this, however, he was di&s;appointed; and though he re|ceived a &s;upply of water, and &s;uch other nece&s;&s;a|ries as in like circum&s;tances, the people of one civi|lized nation would &s;carcely refu&s;e to tho&s;e of an other, he could not make the Viceroy, who appears to have been jealous of the de&s;igns of the Engli&s;h,

and who be&s;ides, was not celebrated for his know|ledge, comprehend the true intent of the expedi|tion.</P>
<P>On the 7th of December, the Endeavour got un|der &s;ail, and on the 14th of January, 1769, Mr. Cook entered the Strait of Le Maire, and next day anchored in the Bay of Good Succe&s;s, where the following remarkable adventure happened to Mr. Banks, Dr. Solander, and &s;ome others who accompanied them in a botanical excur&s;ion. Hav|ing a&s;cended a mountain in &s;earch of plants, they were expo&s;ed to &s;uch an inten&s;e degree of cold, that Dr. Solander was &s;eized with a torper, which had nearly put a period to his exi&s;tence. Two black &s;ervants who attended our adventurers, ac|tually died, and this event took place in the mid&s;t of &s;ummer, in that part of the world, and at the clo&s;e of a day, the beginning of which was as mild and warm as the month of May u&s;ually is in England.</P>
<P>After doubling Cape Horn, and di&s;covering &s;e|veral i&s;lands, mo&s;t of which appeared to be inha|bited, and to be clothed with the mo&s;t beautiful verdure, Mr. Cook arrived in &s;ight of Otaheite, on the 11th of April, and on the 13th the Endeavour came to anchor in Port Royal Bay, which by the natives is called <HI>Matavai.</HI> The fir&s;t object which engaged our navigator's attention upon his arrival here, does the highe&s;t honor to his good &s;en&s;e and humanity. As he was &s;en&s;ible that his &s;tay at the i&s;land was not likely to be long, and that much de|pended
<PB N="15" REF="030274_1246_0FE577CFA44E6730">
upon the manner in which the Engli&s;h be|haved towards the natives, he drew up a &s;et of re|gulations for the conduct of his people, and gave expre&s;s orders that they &s;hould be &s;trictly ob&s;erved. The&s;e orders were as follows: Fir&s;t, "To endea|vor by every fair means to cultivate a friend&s;hip with the natives; and to treat them with all ima|ginable humanity. Secondly, a proper per&s;on or per&s;ons will be appointed to trade with the natives for all manner of provi&s;ions, fruit, and other pro|ductions of the earth, and no officer or &s;eaman, or other per&s;on belonging to the &s;hip, except &s;uch as are &s;o appointed, &s;hall trade, or offer to trade for any &s;ort of provi&s;ion fruit, or other productions of the earth, unle&s;s they have leave to do &s;o. Thirdly, every per&s;on employed on &s;hore, or on any duty what&s;oever, is &s;trictly to attend to the &s;ame, and if by any neglect, he lo&s;eth any of his arms or work|ing tools, or &s;uffers them to be &s;tolen, the full value thereof will be charged again&s;t his pay, according to the cu&s;tom of the navy in &s;uch ca&s;es, and he &s;hall receive &s;uch farther puni&s;hment as the nature of the offence may de&s;erve. Fourthly, the &s;ame penalty will be inflicted on every per&s;on who is found to embezzel, trade, or offer to trade with any part of the &s;hip's &s;tores, of what&s;oever nature they may be. And la&s;tly, no &s;ort of iron, or any thing that is made of iron, or any &s;ort of cloth, or other u&s;eful or nece&s;&s;ary articles, are to be given in exchange for any thing but provi&s;ion."</P>
<P>Having accompli&s;hed the grand object of his expedition, a particular account of which may be
<PB N="16" REF="030274_1247_0FE578056935CA18">
&s;een in the &s;ixty-fir&s;t volume of the Philo&s;ophical Tran&s;actions, our navigator began to think of pur|&s;uing his voyage, in obedience to the orders which he had received from the Lords Commi&s;&s;ioners of the Admiralty. Having therefore, got every thing in readine&s;s for his departure, and having taken on board a native of the country, named <HI>Tupia,</HI> who brought with him a boy of 13 years of age, and earne&s;tly entreated that he might be allowed to ac|company the Engli&s;h, he weighed anchor on the 13th of July, after a &s;tay of three months. To give a particular account of all the places vi&s;it|ed by Mr. Cook, in the cour&s;e of this voyage, would be tedious; let it therefore be &s;ufficient to &s;ay, that, after a&s;certaining New-Zealand to be two i&s;lands, and after &s;pending &s;ix months in exploring their coa&s;ts, he made for New-Holland, where he anchored, in Botany Bay, on the 28th of April, 1770. Great part of the coa&s;ts of this exten&s;ive country Mr. Cook examined al&s;o, and finding on his arrival at Batavia, to which he had directed his cour&s;e, that it would be dangerous to proceed to Europe, without in&s;pecting the Endeavour's bottom, he reque&s;ted leave from the Governor to heave her down, which was readily complied with. Before the ve&s;&s;el was refitted, the dreadful effects of that unhealthy climate were &s;everely felt. Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander, were attacked by fevers, and in a little time almo&s;t every per&s;on both on board and on &s;hore, was &s;ick. This circum&s;tance occa&s;ioned a great delay, and though &s;everal of the gentlemen
<PB N="17" REF="030274_1248_0FE577D17562B3C8">
were con&s;iderably better by the time the &s;hip was ready for &s;ea, yet the number of &s;ick even then amounted to forty, and the re&s;t of the company were in a very feeble condition. What may ap|pear rather &s;ingular is, that the &s;ailmaker, an old man, between &s;eventy and eighty years of age, and who got drunk every day during the time he re|&s;ided at Batavia, was the only per&s;on who continu|ed in full health. Three &s;eaman, and Mr. Green's &s;ervant died, together with the &s;urgeon, <HI>Tupia</HI> and his companion <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ayeto.</HI> The former did not entire|ly fall a &s;acrifice to the unwhole&s;omene&s;s of the climate: having been accu&s;tomed to &s;eed princi|pally upon vegetables, he &s;oon contracted tho&s;e di&s;orders which are incident to a &s;ea life, and in all probability would have &s;unk under them, even if the Engli&s;h had not been obliged to go to Batavia.</P>
<P>On the 27th of December Mr. Cook departed from Batavia, and having taken in a fre&s;h &s;upply of wood and water, together with &s;ome refre&s;h|ments, at Prince's I&s;land, he directed his cour&s;e for the Cape of Good Hope; but before he reach|ed that place, the &s;eeds of di&s;ea&s;e which had been received at Batavia appeared with alarming &s;ymp|toms, and reduced the &s;hip's crew to the mo&s;t me|lancholy &s;ituation. Mr. Banks' life was almo&s;t de&s;paired of, and &s;o dreadful was the ravage of the di&s;temper, that &s;carcely a night pa&s;&s;ed but &s;ome dead body was committed to the deep. In the cour&s;e of &s;ix weeks, Mr. Sporing, one of Mr.
<PB N="18" REF="030274_1249_0FE57807506B9530">
Banks' a&s;&s;i&s;tants, Mr. Parkin&s;on, his natural hi&s;to|ry painter, Mr. Green, the a&s;tronomer, the boat|&s;wain, the carpenter, and his mate, Mr. Monk-hou&s;e, the mid&s;hipman, another mid&s;hipman, the old &s;ailmaker and his a&s;&s;i&s;tant, the &s;hip's cook, the corporal of the marines, two of the carpenter's crew, and nine of the &s;eamen, all &s;hared the &s;ame fate. The lo&s;s in all amounted to twenty-three per&s;ons, be&s;ides the &s;even who died at Batavia.</P>
<P>The evident proofs which Mr. Cook exhibited of his &s;agacity, re&s;olution and activity, during this perilous enterprize, in which he had encountered many dangers and difficulties, gave him a ju&s;t claim to the protection of government, and to the favour of his &s;overeign. He was, therefore, &s;oon after his arrival, promoted to be a commander in his Maje&s;ty's navy, by commi&s;&s;ion bearing date Au|gu&s;t 29th, 1771. On this occa&s;ion, he wi&s;hed to have been appointed a Po&s;t Captain; but Lord Sandwich, who was now at the head of the Admi|ralty, though he had the greate&s;t e&s;teem for our na|vigator, would not comply with his reque&s;t, be|cau&s;e it would have been incon&s;i&s;tent with the e&s;ta|bli&s;hed order of the naval &s;ervice.</P>
<P>Though Captain Cook had fully accompli&s;hed the main object of his voyage, and though he had afterwards traver&s;ed great part of the Pacific Ocean, and explored the coa&s;ts of New-Zealand and New Holland, he had not, however, been able to determine the grand que&s;tion, re&s;pecting a <HI>Ter|ra Au&s;tralis Incognita,</HI> or <HI>&s;outhern continent,</HI> which had long amu&s;ed Europe. The fir&s;t per&s;on who
<PB N="19" REF="030274_1250_0FE577D2F9F82238">
&s;eems to have entertained any notion of this kind, was the famous Quiros, who was &s;ent out for the expre&s;s purpo&s;e of di&s;covering it; but he did not &s;ucceed, and all tho&s;e who made the &s;ame attempt afterwards were equally un&s;ucce&s;sful. To deter|mine, therefore, this point, of &s;o much importance to geography and navigation, a &s;econd expedition was planned out, at the de&s;ire of his Maje&s;ty, who&s;e patronage of literature and &s;cience has been eminently con&s;picuous; and no per&s;on appeared better qualified to undertake it than Captain Cook.</P>
<P>When this de&s;ign was fully re&s;olved upon, two ve&s;&s;els, which had been both built at Whitby, by the &s;ame per&s;on who had built the Endeavour, were purcha&s;ed of Captain William Hammond, of Hull. The large&s;t, which was about four hundred and &s;ixty-two tons burthen, was called the Re&s;olution, and the other, which was con&s;ide|rably le&s;s, was named the Adventure. On the 28th of November, 1771, Captain Cook was ap|pointed to the command of the former, and about the &s;ame time Mr. Tobias Furneaux to that of the latter. In the equipment of the&s;e ve&s;&s;els, every po&s;&s;ible attention was be&s;towed; they were &s;uppli|ed with the be&s;t &s;tores and provi&s;ions, and every article &s;uited to the nature of the expedition was put on board of them, be&s;ides abundance of an|ti&s;corbutics, &s;uch as malt, &s;our krout, &s;alted cab|bage, portable broth, &s;aloup, mu&s;tard, marmalade of carrots, and in&s;pi&s;&s;ated juice of wort and beer.</P>
<P>The advancement of &s;cience was equally con|&s;ulted. Mr. Wm. Hodges, an eminent land&s;cape
<PB N="20" REF="030274_1251_0FE5774F8FE847E8">
painter, was engaged to make drawings of &s;uch objects as could not be &s;o well comprehended from de&s;criptions; Mr. John Reinhold Fo&s;ter, and his &s;on, were appointed to explore the natural hi&s;tory of the countries they might vi&s;it, and Mr. Wm. Wales, and Mr. Wm. Bayley, were cho&s;en on purpo&s;e to make a&s;tronomical ob&s;ervations.</P>
<P>On the 9th of April 1772, Captain Cook &s;ailed from Deptford, and on the 3d of July, joined the Adventure in Plymouth Sound. From Plymouth, he departed on the 13th of the &s;ame month, and having touched at Madeira, to obtain a &s;upply of water, wine and other nece&s;&s;aries, proceeded on his voyage, but finding that his water would not la&s;t to the Cape of Good Hope, without putting his men to &s;hort allowance, he re&s;olved to touch at St. Jago, one of the Cape de Verd I&s;lands, in order to get a fre&s;h &s;tock. On the 10th of Augu&s;t he arrived at Port Praya, in that i&s;land, and having procured a &s;ufficiency of water and other refre&s;h|ments, put to &s;ea again, on the 14th, and on the 30th of October, came to anchor in Table Bay, at the Cape of Good Hope, where he was received with the greate&s;t politene&s;s by the Governor, and promi&s;ed every a&s;&s;i&s;tance that the place could afford. From the Cape our commander departed on the 22d of November, in &s;earch of a <HI>&s;outhern continent,</HI> and having got clear of the land, directed his cour&s;e for Cape Circumci&s;ion; but a dreadful gale of wind coming on about the 6th of December, which at times was &s;o furious, that the &s;hips could carry no &s;ail, they were driven &s;o far to the ea&s;tward of
<PB N="21" REF="030274_1252_0FE577D4E33F7FA0">
their cour&s;e, that no hopes were left of reaching the intended &s;pot.</P>
<P>On the 10th of December, our navigators be|gan to meet with i&s;lands of ice, one of which was &s;o concealed by the hazine&s;s of the weather, that they were almo&s;t clo&s;e upon it before it was ob|&s;erved. Captain Cook judged, that it might be about fifty feet high, and half a mile in circumfe|rence. It was flat on the top, and its &s;ides ro&s;e in a perpendicular direction, again&s;t which the &s;ea broke with amazing fury, and was da&s;hed up to a great height. By the 17th of January 1773, he had reached the latitude of 67&deg; 15&prime;, where he found the ice entirely clo&s;ed, and on the 17th of March, after two months longer navigation amid&s;t mountains and i&s;lands of ice, which &s;eemed to threaten de&s;truction on every &s;ide, con&s;idering that it would be very improper to continue longer in high &s;outhern latitudes, he re&s;olved to quit them, and to proceed to New-Zealand, with a view of looking for the Adventure, which had parted from him on the 8th of February, and that he might have an opportunity of procuring &s;ome refre&s;h|ments for his people. He therefore, &s;teered his cour&s;e for that i&s;land, and came to anchor in Du&s;|ky Bay, on the 26th of March, from which he proceeded to Queen Charlotte's Sound, where he had the &s;atisfaction of meeting with the Adventure, after an ab&s;ence of fourteen weeks.</P>
<P>Quitting New-Zealand, in company with the Adventure, Captain Cook paid a vi&s;it to his old friends at Otaheite, the Society and Friendly I&s;les,
<PB N="22" REF="030274_1253_0FE5780D387041E8">
and having examined a &s;pace of more than forty degrees of longitude, between the tropicks, re|turned to Queen Charlotte's Sound. Here he changed the rigging of his &s;hip for &s;uch as might be able to with&s;tand &s;torms and the &s;everity of high &s;outhern latitudes; and again &s;et &s;ail on the 27th of November, to explore the unknown parts of the Pacific Ocean. In this perilous navigation, he was expo&s;ed to dangers which none but a man po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the greate&s;t re&s;olution could have en|countered; yet &s;uch was his &s;trength of mind, and &s;o great was his &s;kill in navigation, that though often interrupted by i&s;lands of ice, among which he was &s;ometimes as it were inclo&s;ed, and though his ve&s;&s;el was almo&s;t every moment in hazard of being da&s;hed to pieces, by large ma&s;&s;es, which floated around, he advanced amid&s;t all the&s;e ob|&s;tacles till nature &s;et bounds to his cour&s;e. Many of the&s;e ice-i&s;lands were two and three hundred feet in height, and between two and three miles in circuit, with perpendicular &s;ides or cliffs, that could not be beheld without a&s;toni&s;hment.</P>
<P>On the 26th of January, 1774, our navigators pa&s;&s;ed the Antarctic circle for the third time in 109 degrees of we&s;t longitude, where they found the milde&s;t &s;un-&s;hine they had ever experienced in the frigid zone. This circum&s;tance induced them to hope, that they &s;hould be able to penetrate as far towards the &s;outh as others had done towards the north; but the next day, they di&s;covered a &s;olid field of ice before them, which extended from ea&s;t to we&s;t farther than the eye could reach. Within
<PB N="23" REF="030274_1254_0FE577DA7119B3C0">
this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> ninety-&s;even i&s;lands were counted, be&s;ides tho&s;e on the out&s;ide, many of which were large, and had the appearance of a ridge of mountains, ri&s;ing one above another, till they were lo&s;t in the clouds. The outer, or northern edge of this im|men&s;e field, was compo&s;ed of loo&s;e or broken ice, packed &s;o clo&s;ely together, that there was no po&s;|&s;ibility of entering it; but Captain Cook was of opinion, that there mu&s;t be land to the &s;outh be|hind it. "If there is," &s;ays he, "it can afford no better retreat for birds, or any other animals than the ice it&s;elf, with which it mu&s;t be entirely covered." He then adds, "I, who was ambiti|ous not only of going farther than any body had gone before, but as far as it was po&s;&s;ible for man to go, was not &s;orry at meeting with this interrup|tion, as it in &s;ome mea&s;ure relieved us, and &s;hort|ened the dangers and hard&s;hips in&s;eparable from the navigation of the &s;outhern polar regions. Since then, we could not proceed farther to the &s;outh, no other rea&s;on need be a&s;&s;igned for my tacking and &s;tanding back to the north, being at this time in the latitude of 70&deg; 10&prime; &s;outh and lon|gitude 106&deg; 54&prime; we&s;t."</P>
<P>Our navigator next went in que&s;t of land &s;aid to have been di&s;covered by Juan Fernandez, no ve&s;tiges of which he could find. He then proceed|ed to the Marque&s;as, di&s;covered in 1565, and vi&s;it|ed for the &s;econd time during this voyage the i&s;land of Otaheite, where having procured &s;ome refre&s;h|ments, he &s;ailed for the New-Hebrides which though di&s;covered as early as 1606, by Quitos,
<PB N="24" REF="030274_1255_0FE5780EDF8657D0">
had never been &s;ufficiently explored. Be&s;ides a&s;|certaining the extent and &s;ituation of the&s;e i&s;lands, which had been barely &s;een by others, he acquir|ed a knowledge of &s;everal before unknown, which entitled him to give the whole that appellation by which they are now di&s;tingui&s;hed.</P>
<P>Captain Cook continued &s;urveying the&s;e i&s;lands during the month of Augu&s;t, 1774, and having &s;et &s;ail on the 1&s;t of Augu&s;t, di&s;covered a large track of land, to which he gave the name of New-Caledonia. The coa&s;ts of this he explored al&s;o, and found it to be the mo&s;t con&s;iderable of all the tropical i&s;lands in tho&s;e parts, and except New-Holland and New-Zealand, the large&s;t that has been &s;een in the South Pacific Ocean. On leaving New-Caledonia, he fell in with an uninhabited i&s;l|and, on the 10th of October, which he named Norfolk I&s;le, in honor of the noble family of How|ard, and finding that provi&s;ions were now begin|ning to run &s;hort, he determined to &s;ail again for New-Zealand, where he came to anchor on the 18th of October. Here he continued till the 10th of November, when he again &s;et out, in pur&s;uit of his great object, the determination of the que&s;tion concerning the exi&s;tence of a &s;outhern continent; but having &s;ailed till the 27th, in different degrees of latitude, extending from 43&deg; to 55&deg; 48&prime; &s;outh without &s;ucce&s;s, he gave up all hopes of finding it, and re&s;olved to &s;teer directly for the we&s;t entrance of the &s;traits of Maghalhaens, with a view of coa&s;t|ing the &s;outh &s;ide of Terra del Fuego, round Cape Horn to the &s;trait Le Maire.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="030274_1256_0FE5774074588340">During the re&s;t of the voyage very little remark|able occured. After leaving Terra del Fuego, our navigator proceeded round Cape Horn, pa&s;&s;ed through Strait Le Mair, to Staten I&s;land, and hav|ing explored part of the neighbouring &s;eas, direct|ed his cour&s;e to the Cape of Good Hope, from which he &s;ailed to England, where he arrived on the 19th of July, 1775, having been ab&s;ent from it three years and eighteen days.</P>
<P>Though the que&s;tion re&s;pecting the exi&s;tence of a &s;outhern continent was now fully determined, there remained &s;till another important object to be inve&s;tigated, the practicability of a northern pa&s;|&s;age to the Pacific Ocean. It had long been a fa|vorite &s;cheme with navigators, and particularly the Engli&s;h, to di&s;cover a &s;horter and more commodi|ous cour&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o the Ea&s;t Indies, than that by the Cape of Good Hope. Several attempts were made for this purpo&s;e, both by our own countrymen, and the Dutch; but with &s;o little &s;ucce&s;s, that it cea&s;ed for many years to be an object of pur&s;uit. In the beginning of the pre&s;ent century it was again re|vived by Mr. Dobbs, and Captain Middleton was &s;ent out by government in 1741, and Captain Smith and Captain Moore in 1746; but though an act of parliament had been pa&s;&s;ed, which &s;ecured a re|ward of twenty thou&s;and pounds to the di&s;coverer, the accompli&s;hment of this favorite object continu|ed at as great a di&s;tance as ever.</P>
<P>To a&s;certain whether this matter, of &s;o much importance to geography and navigation, could be carried into execution, was re&s;erved for the glory of the pre&s;ent reign. The idea was very warmly e&s;pou&s;ed by the Fir&s;t Lord of the Admiralty, and it was re&s;olved that a voyage &s;hould be undertaken for that purpo&s;e. For the conduct of this enter|prize, it was evident that great &s;kill and ability
<PB N="26" REF="030274_1257_0FE5781066B9F4A8">
were requi&s;ite, and though no one was &s;o well qualified for it as Captain Cook, yet none of his friends, not even Lord Sandwich, pre&s;umed to &s;olicit him on the &s;ubject. The &s;ervice he had ren|dered to &s;cience and navigation was &s;o great, the labors he had &s;u&s;tained, and the dangers he had encountered were &s;o many, and &s;o various, that it was deemed not rea&s;onable to a&s;k him to engage in fre&s;h perils. His advice, however, was reque&s;ted, re&s;pecting the propere&s;t per&s;on for undertaking the voyage, and in order to determine this point, the Captain, Sir Hugh Palli&s;er, and Mr. Stephens, were invited to dinner at Lord Sandwich's hou&s;e. In the cour&s;e of the conver&s;ation, while they were di&s;cour&s;ing on the importance of the de&s;ign, and the con&s;equences that were likely to re&s;ult from it to &s;cience and navigation, Cook's mind was &s;o fir|ed with the magnitude of the object, that he &s;ud|denly &s;tarted up and declared, that he him&s;elf would undertake the direction of it. No propo&s;al could be received with more plea&s;ure. Lord Sandwich immediately laid the affair before his Maje&s;ty, and Capt. Cook was appointed to the expedition, on the 10th of February, 1776.</P>
<P>When the command of the enterpri&s;e was thus &s;ettled, much to the &s;atisfaction of tho&s;e who had &s;et it on foot, it was con&s;idered as a matter of great importance to determine what might be the be&s;t cour&s;e to be pur&s;ued in the voyage. All former navigators round the globe had returned by the Cape of Good Hope; but to Capt. Cook was a&s;|&s;igned the arduous ta&s;k of attempting the &s;ame thing, by reaching the high northern latitudes, between A|&s;ia and America; and it appears, that this plan was adopted in con&s;equence of his own &s;ugge&s;tions. He was, therefore, ordered to proceed to the Pacific Ocean, through that chain of i&s;lands which he had before vi&s;ited, in the tropical regions of the &s;outh,
<PB N="27" REF="030274_1258_0FE577DD397BB6A8">
and thence, if practicable, to make his way into the Atlantic. To give every po&s;&s;ible encourage|ment to the pro&s;ecution of this great de&s;ign, mo|tives of intere&s;t were added to the ob<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">igations of duty. In the act of parliament pa&s;&s;ed in 1745, the reward of twenty thou&s;and pounds was offered on|ly to ve&s;&s;els <HI>belonging to any of his Maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects:</HI> &s;hips belonging to government being thus excluded. Be&s;ides this, the reward was entirely confined to &s;uch as &s;hould di&s;cover a pa&s;&s;age through Hud&s;on's Bay, but by a new act, which pa&s;&s;ed in 1776, it was declared, that if any &s;hip belonging to any of his Maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects or <HI>to his Maje&s;ty</HI>&punc; &s;hould find and &s;ail through any pa&s;&s;age by &s;ea, between the Atlan|tic and Pacific Oceans, in <HI>any direction,</HI> or parallel of the northern hemi&s;phere, to the northward of the fifty-&s;econd degree of northern latitude, the owners of &s;uch &s;hips, if belonging to any of his Ma|je&s;ty's &s;ubjects, <HI>or the commander, officers and &s;eaman of &s;uch &s;hip, if belonging to his Maje&s;ty,</HI> &s;hould receive as a reward for &s;uch di&s;covery the &s;um of twenty thou&s;and pounds.</P>
<P>The ve&s;&s;els fixed upon by government for this &s;ervice, were the Re&s;olution and the Di&s;covery. The command of the former was given to Captain Cook, and that of the latter to Capt. Clerk, who had been our navigator's &s;econd lieutenant in his &s;econd voyage. Nearly the &s;ame complement of men and officers was a&s;&s;igned to each as before, and the utmo&s;t attention was employed by the Admiralty Board to have them equipped in the com|pleate&s;t manner. Every article that could tend to pre&s;erve the health of the &s;eamen was provided in abundance; and that the inhabitants of Otaheite, and of the other i&s;lands in the South Seas where the Engli&s;h had been treated with &s;o much ho&s;pitality, might be benefited by the expedition, his Maje&s;ty
<PB N="28" REF="030274_1259_0FE548DD3AE07E98">
was graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to order an a&s;&s;ortment of u&s;e|ful animals to be put on board, and to be left in tho&s;e countries. Be&s;ides the&s;e, the Captain was fur|ni&s;hed with a quantity of European garden-&s;eeds, and the Board of Admiralty added &s;uch articles of commerce as were mo&s;t likely to promote a friend|ly intercour&s;e with the natives of the other hemi&s;|phere, and to induce them to carry on a profitable traffic with the Engli&s;h. Additional clothing, &s;uit|ed to the &s;everities of a cold climate, was likewi&s;e ordered for the crews of the two &s;hips, and nothing was denied our navigators that could contribute to l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;&s;en the hard&s;hips of the expedition, or to render their &s;ituation comfortable.</P>
<P>As the &s;hips were to touch at Otaheite and the Society I&s;les, it had been determined to &s;end back by this opportunity Omai, a native of that country, whom Capt. Furneaux brought with him to Eng|land the former voyage. He therefore left London on the 24th of June, 1776, in company with the Captain, and every preparation being completed, they &s;ailed for Plymouth, where they were joined by the Di&s;covery. From Plymouth our navigators directed their cour&s;e to Teneriff, to procure a fre&s;h &s;upply of corn and hay, for the &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of their live &s;tock. They then proceeded to the Cape, where they &s;taid from the 18th of October till the 30th of November, and having touched at Kergue|len's I&s;land, and Van Diemen's Land, di&s;covered by Ta&s;man in 1642, arrived at Queen Charlotte's Sound, in New-Zealand, on the 12th of Febru|ary, 1777.</P>
<P>At New-Zealand they &s;taid about two weeks, during which time they acquired much additional knowledge re&s;pecting its productions, and the man|ners and cu&s;toms of its inhabitants. They then paid a vi&s;it to the Friendly I&s;les, where they re|mained &s;ome time, and where Captain Cook neg|lected
<PB N="29" REF="030274_1260_0FE577DF1310E3D0">
no opportunity of making &s;uch ob&s;ervations as might be &s;erviceable to navigation and a&s;trono|my. From the information which he then receiv|ed, it appears, that this Archipelago is very ex|ten&s;ive; above one hundred and fifty i&s;lands were reckoned up by the natives, who made u&s;e of bits of leaves to a&s;certain their number; and Mr. An|der&s;on, with his u&s;ual diligence, procured all their names. Sixty-one of the&s;e i&s;les have their proper places and names marked out upon the chart of the Friendly I&s;les, and the &s;ketch of the harbour of Tongataboo, which are given in the account pub|li&s;hed of this expedition.</P>
<P>On the 17th of July Capt. Cook took his final leave of the Friendly I&s;les, and, re&s;uming his voy|age, reached Otaheite on the 12th of Augu&s;t. From Otaheite he proceeded to &s;ome other of the Society I&s;les, and having di&s;po&s;ed of Omai, agree|able to his wi&s;hes, and di&s;tributed part of his live &s;tock, in &s;uch a manner as he thought would be&s;t an&s;wer the propo&s;ed end, he determined to pur&s;ue his cour&s;e to the northward. Setting &s;ail, there|fore, from <HI>Bolabola,</HI> on the 8th of December, he cro&s;&s;ed the line about the 24th, and on the 18th of January, 1778, di&s;covered an i&s;land, which he, however, could not reach. Soon after another appeared, on which he went on &s;hore, and in the cour&s;e of a few days, a whole group was &s;een which Capt. Cook, in honor of Lord Sandwich, di&s;tin|gui&s;hed by the name of the Sandwich I&s;lands. Tho&s;e which he &s;aw were &s;ituated between the lati|tude of 20&deg; 30&prime;, and 22&deg; 15&prime; north, and between the longitude of 199&deg; 29&prime;, and 201&deg; 30&prime; ea&s;t.</P>
<P>On quitting the&s;e i&s;lands, Captain Cook proceed|ed to range along the we&s;tern &s;ide of America, and after giving names to &s;everal capes and headlands, which appeared in &s;ight, came to anchor in an in|let, where the country pre&s;ented a very different
<PB N="30" REF="030274_1261_0FE5781C601FFFC0">
a&s;pect from what he had &s;een before. The &s;um|mits of the mountains were clothed in &s;heets of &s;now, while the valleys between them and the grounds on the &s;ea coa&s;t, both high and low, were covered to a con&s;iderable breadth, with tall &s;treight trees, which formed a mo&s;t beautiful pro&s;pect, as of one immen&s;e fore&s;t. On his fir&s;t arrival in this inlet, he had honored it with the name of King George's Sound; but he afterwards found that it was called <HI>Nootka</HI> by the natives. Having &s;taid nearly a month here, to complete the nece&s;&s;ary re|pairs of the &s;hips, our navigators proceeded north|ward, and entered another inlet, from which great things were expected, as they entertained the &s;trong|e&s;t hopes, that it would be found to communicate either with the &s;ea to the north, or with Baffi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">'s or Hud&s;on's bay to the ea&s;t. On this account, there|fore, it was traced as high as the latitude of 60&deg; 30&prime;, and the longitude of 210&deg;, being &s;eventy leagues from its entrance, but without &s;ucce&s;s; for after &s;everal fruitle&s;s attempts to di&s;cover a pa&s;|&s;age through it, this idea was abandoned, and Captain Cook named it River Turnagain. Lord Sandwich has &s;ince di&s;tingui&s;hed it by the appella|tion of <HI>Cook's River.</HI></P>
<P>Indefatigable in pur&s;uit of his favorite object, Captain Cook continued his re&s;earches, and arrived on the 27th of June, 1778, at the i&s;land of <HI>Oona|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a,</HI> the inhabitants of which behaved with a de|gree of friend&s;hip and politene&s;s very uncommon to &s;avage tribes. He then <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">eered towards the Ame|rican coa&s;t, and having advanced as far as the lati|tude of 70&deg; 44&prime;, found his progre&s;s &s;topped by the ice, which was as compact as a wall, and at lea&s;t ten or twelve feet in height; &s;till farther north it appeared to be much higher; its &s;urface was ex|tremely rugged, and in different places it was co|vered with pools of water. A prodigious number
<PB N="31" REF="030274_1262_0FE577E098105EB0">
of &s;ea-hor&s;es lay upon it, &s;ome of which were pro|cured for food, as at this time there was a great want of fre&s;h provi&s;ions, and though many of the &s;ailors were di&s;appointed, having at fir&s;t concluded that the&s;e animals were &s;ea-cows, yet &s;uch was the general anxiety for a change of diet, that our voy|agers lived on them as long as they la&s;ted.</P>
<P>From the 26th of April, the time that Capt. Cook left Nootka, to the 29th of July, many important di&s;coverie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> were made, which it is impo&s;&s;ible to par|ticularize here. They form a valuable addition to tho&s;e made in the cour&s;e of his two former voyages, and, in point of extent, &s;urpa&s;s all that the Ru&s;&s;ians had accompli&s;hed in a long &s;eries of years, though in parts belonging or contiguous to their own em|pire. He had previous to the la&s;t mentioned peri|od, traver&s;ed the Icy Sea beyond Beering's Strait, in various directions, and through numberle&s;s dif|ficulties and ob&s;tructions; but he never abandoned the pur&s;uit of his favorite object till the ice increa&s;|ed &s;o much, as to preclude all hopes of attaining it, at lea&s;t during that year. The &s;ea&s;on being far ad|vanced, and the time when the fro&s;t was expected to &s;et in being fa&s;t approaching, he thought it im|prudent to make any farther attempts to find a pa&s;|&s;age into the Atlantic, till the next &s;ummer. He, therefore, began now to look out for a place where he might, be&s;ides procuring wood and water, con|veniently pa&s;s the winter, and as none &s;eemed bet|ter adapted for that purpo&s;e than &s;ome of the Sand|wich I&s;les, he determined to direct his cour&s;e thither.</P>
<P>Hitherto this expedition, though attended with many dangers and difficulties, had been marked with no peculiar di&s;a&s;ter, and our illu&s;trious commander was no doubt flattering him&s;elf with the hopes of be|ing more &s;ucce&s;sful in his re&s;earches the next &s;um|mer; but little did he think that the <HI>Sandwich I&s;les,</HI> which he con&s;idered as the mo&s;t important di&s;cove|ry
<PB N="32" REF="030274_1263_0FE5781E9F758338">
of all that had been made by Europeans in the Pacific Ocean, would in the re&s;ult prove fatal, and that he &s;hould there fall by the murdering dagger of a barbarian. To relate an event of this kind mu&s;t ever be a painful ta&s;k to a feeling mind; but it mu&s;t be doubly &s;o, when it appears that the unhap|py &s;ufferer became a victim to his own humanity.</P>
<P>In Captain Cook's former vi&s;it to this group of i&s;lands, he had ob&s;erved five of them &s;ituated be|tween the latitude of 20&deg; 30&prime;, and 22&deg; 15&prime; north, and between the longitude of 199&deg; 30&prime;, and 201&deg; 30&prime; ea&s;t, the names of which were <HI>Woahoo, Atooi, Oneeheow, Oreehoua</HI> and <HI>Tahoora;</HI> but on his re|turn &s;outhward, with an intent of pa&s;&s;ing the win|ter, he di&s;covered on the 26th of November, when he came to the latitude of 20&deg; 55&prime;, a &s;ixth, named <HI>Mowee,</HI> and on the 30th, another, which the na|tives di&s;tingui&s;hed by the appellation of <HI>Owhyhee.</HI> As this i&s;land appeared to be of greater extent and importance that any of the re&s;t, our navigator &s;pent nearly &s;even weeks in &s;ailing round it, and in ex|amining its coa&s;ts. Whil&s;t he was employed in this bu&s;ine&s;s, the inhabitants came off from time to time in great numbers with their canoes, and readily en|gaged in traffic. On this occa&s;ion their behaviour was open and unre&s;erved, and afforded much le&s;s cau&s;e for &s;u&s;picion than that of any other people among whom our navigators had ever been. It was even remarked, that the people of Otaheite it|&s;elf with whom he had been &s;o intimately connected, had never di&s;played &s;uch unbounded confidence in the integrity and good treatment of the Engli&s;h.</P>
<P>On the 17th of January, 1779, our navigators came to anchor in the Bay of <HI>Karakakooa,</HI> which is &s;ituated on the we&s;t &s;ide of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he i&s;land of <HI>Owhyhee,</HI> and extends about a mile in depth. It is bounded by two points of land, bearing &s;outh-ea&s;t and north-we&s;t from each other, at the di&s;tance of half a league:
<PB N="33" REF="030274_1264_0FE577E81489EB58">
on the northernmo&s;t of which is &s;ituated a village called <HI>Kowrowa.</HI> A more con&s;iderable village &s;tands in the bottom of the Bay, near a &s;tately grove of cocoa-nut trees, and a high rocky cliff, inacce&s;&s;i|ble from the &s;ea &s;hore, runs between them. Near the coa&s;t on the &s;outh &s;ide, the land has a rugged appearance, but farther inland the country gradual|ly ri&s;es, and abounds with cultivated enclo&s;ures and groves of cocoa trees.</P>
<P>While Capt. Cook remained here, the i&s;landers behaved with the greate&s;t friend&s;hip, and &s;eemed very much di&s;po&s;ed to render him every a&s;&s;i&s;tance in their power. Several of their chiefs paid him a vi&s;it, and when he him&s;elf went on &s;hore, he was received with very extraordinary ceremonies, which fell little &s;hort of adoration. He had likewi&s;e an interview with <HI>Terreeoboo,</HI> the king of the i&s;land, whom he carried on board the Re&s;olution, where he was treated with every mark of re&s;pect, and in return for a beautiful feathered cloak which he had be&s;towed on our navigator, the Captain put a linen &s;hirt on his Maje&s;ty, and girt his own hanger round him. In &s;hort, during the intercour&s;e which was kept up between the natives and the Engli&s;h, the greate&s;t harmony prevailed, and the quiet, inoffen|&s;ive behavior of the former bani&s;hed every appre|hen&s;ion of danger from the brea&s;ts of our voyagers. The i&s;landers, however, began at length to be very inqui&s;itive about the time of their departure; but this is not much to be wondered at, when it is con|&s;idered, that during &s;ixteen days, which they had been in the harbour of <HI>Karakakooa,</HI> they had made an enormous con&s;umption both of hogs and vege|tables. It afterwards appeared, that the&s;e enquiries were made with no other view than that they might provide a &s;ufficient quantity of provi&s;ions for them when they quitted the i&s;land; for it was ob&s;erved,
<PB N="34" REF="030274_1265_0FE5782076797AF8">
that the King, on being informed that they were about to depart in a few days, made a kind of pro|clamation throughout the villages, requiring the people to bring in their hogs and vegetables, that his Maje&s;ty might pre&s;ent them to the <HI>Orono</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Orono</HI> was a title of high honor be&s;towed on Captain Cook.</NOTE>, be|fore he took his leave of the country. A circum|&s;tance which &s;eems to prove the affectionate regard which the people of <HI>Owhyhee</HI> had for our voyagers is, that their prince &s;trongly &s;olicited Mr. King to remain among them, and waited upon Capt. Cook who&s;e &s;on he &s;uppo&s;ed him to be, with a formal re|que&s;t that he might be left.</P>
<P>On the 4th of February, Captain Cook quitted <HI>Karakakooa Bay,</HI> with an intention of fini&s;hing the &s;urvey of <HI>Owhyhee,</HI> and of proceeding afterwards to the re&s;t of the i&s;lands, in que&s;t of &s;ome road which might afford better &s;helter to the ve&s;&s;els; but a gale of wind ari&s;ing, in the cour&s;e of a few days the Re&s;olution had the misfortune to &s;pring the head of her forema&s;t, in &s;uch a dangerous man|ner, that it was found nece&s;&s;ary to return to <HI>Kara|kakooa,</HI> in order to have it repaired. It does not &s;ufficiently appear from the accounts given of Capt. Cook's death, whether the natives were di&s;plea&s;ed or not with this &s;econd vi&s;it. Captain King &s;ays, "That our voyagers, upon coming to anchor, were &s;urpri&s;ed to find their reception very different from what it had been on their fir&s;t arrival; but Mr. Samwell, who&s;e veracity &s;eems unque&s;tionable, a&s;|&s;erts, that he &s;aw nothing which could induce him to believe, that there was any change in the di&s;|po&s;ition or behavior of the inhabitants. However this may be, it is certain, that &s;ome acts of theft committed by the i&s;landers, and the attempts of the Engli&s;h to puni&s;h them, and to recover their pro|perty, were the preludes to that unhappy commo|tion, which deprived the Briti&s;h navy of one of
<PB N="35" REF="030274_1266_0FE577EACFC10CF0">
its brighte&s;t ornaments, and our illu&s;trious navi|gator of his life.</P>
<P>The&s;e people it &s;eems had a &s;trong propen&s;ity to thieving, and one of them having been detected in carrying of the amourer's tongs from the forge, was puni&s;hed with a pretty &s;evere flogging, and &s;ent out of the &s;hip. This example, however, did not deter another, who, having &s;natched the tongs and chi&s;&s;el from the &s;ame place, jumped overboard with them, and &s;wam for the &s;hore. The ma&s;ter and a mid&s;hipman were in&s;tantly di&s;patched after him in the &s;mall cutter, upon which the Indian made for a canoe, where he was taken on board by one of his countrymen, and though &s;everal mu&s;kets were fired at them, they &s;oon got out of gun &s;hot, and e&s;caped. <HI>Pareah,</HI> one of their chiefs, afterwards brought back the &s;tolen articles, but on his return, being met by the Re&s;olution's pinnace, with five men in her, who in&s;i&s;ted upon having the thief delivered up, or the canoe which had taken him in, a &s;cuffle en&s;ued, and the natives began to pelt the Engli&s;h with &s;tones. This commotion was, however, quelled by the interference of <HI>Pareah;</HI> but another circum&s;tance of the &s;ame kind &s;oon after occured, which widened the breach between them. Some of the i&s;landers found means in the night time to take away the Di&s;covery's large cut|ter, which lay &s;wamped at the buoy of one of her anchors, and &s;he was not mi&s;&s;ed till the next morn|ing, Sunday, February the 14th. When Captain Clerke had informed Captain Cook of this event, he returned on board, with orders for the launch and &s;mall cutter to go, under the command of the &s;econd lieutenant, and to lie off the ea&s;t &s;ide of the Bay, in order to intercept all canoes that might attempt to get out; and if he found it nece&s;&s;ary, to fire upon them. At the &s;ame time, the third

lieutenant of the Re&s;olution, with the launch and &s;mall cutter, was &s;ent out on the &s;ame &s;ervice, to the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the Bay, and the ma&s;ter was di&s;patched in the large cutter, in pur&s;uit of a dou|ble canoe already under &s;ail, and making the be&s;t of her way out of the harbor.</P>
<P>As it had been Capt. Cook's u&s;ual cu&s;tom in all the i&s;lands of the South Seas, when any thing of con&s;equence had been &s;tolen, to &s;ecure the per&s;on of the King, or of &s;ome of the principal <HI>Erees,</HI> and to detain them as ho&s;tages, until the property was re&s;tored, he re&s;olved to adopt this method on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion. He therefore left the &s;hip about &s;even o'clock, attended by the lieutenant of marines, a &s;erjeant, a corporal, and &s;even private men, and the pinnace's crew were al&s;o armed, un|der the command of Mr. Roberts. As they rowed towards the &s;hore, Captain Cook ordered the launch to leave her &s;tation at the we&s;t point of the Bay, in order to a&s;&s;i&s;t his own boat, which clearly &s;hews that he was not unapprehen&s;ive of meeting with re&s;i&s;tance, and that he was de&s;irous of making ne|ce&s;&s;ary preparations for the defence of him&s;elf and his people. When he landed, the natives flocked round him in great crowds, &s;hewed him the u&s;ual marks of re&s;pect, by pro&s;trating them&s;elves before him, and being ignorant of his intention in com|ing a&s;hore, frequently a&s;ked him if he wanted <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ogs or provi&s;ions. As &s;oon as he had found the King, who came out of a hou&s;e without any h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;itation, where he had been a&s;leep, the Captain took him by the hand, and invited him in a friendly manner to go on board, to which he readily con&s;ented. Thus far matters appeared in a favorable train, but in a little time the i&s;landers were ob&s;erved to be bu&s;y in arming them&s;elves with long &s;pears, clubs, and daggers, and in putting on thick mats, which
<PB N="37" REF="030274_1268_0FE5774D08A84B18">
they u&s;ed as armor. This ho&s;tile appearance en|crea&s;ed, and became more alarming on the arrival of two men in a canoe, from the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the Bay, with the news of a chief having been killed by one of the Di&s;covery's boats. The Captain, who by this time, was &s;urrounded by a great crowd, thinking his &s;ituation rather hazardous, ordered the lieutenant of marines to march his &s;mall party to the water &s;ide, where the boats lay, within a few yards of the &s;hore, and the Indians readily made a line for them to pa&s;s, without offering them the lea&s;t mole&s;tation. The di&s;tance they had to go might be about fifty or &s;ixty yards, and Capt. Cook followed, having hold of the King's hand, who was attended by his wife, two &s;ons, and &s;everal chiefs, and who accompanied him without reluc|tance. When they had reached the pinnace, the younger &s;on immediately &s;tepped in, expecting his father to follow; but ju&s;t as he arrived at the water &s;ide, his wife threw her arms round his neck, and with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of two chiefs, forced him to &s;it down by the &s;ide of a double canoe. Capt. Cook expo&s;tulated with them on this behavior; but they would not &s;uffer the King to proceed, telling him, that he would be put to death if he went on board the &s;hip.</P>
<P>One of the chiefs having been &s;een lurking near, with a dagger partly concealed, and another of the natives having made an attempt to wrench a mu&s;|quet from the &s;erjeant of marines, Capt. Cook ob|&s;erved, that as the Indians were becoming more daring and tumultuous, he could not take the King off by force without &s;acrificing the lives of many of his people, he therefore re&s;olved to act only on the defen&s;ive, and to &s;ecure a &s;afe embarkation for his &s;mall party, who were now clo&s;ely pre&s;&s;ed by a body of &s;everal thou&s;and people; one man at|tempted
<PB N="38" REF="030274_1269_0FE578298D180530">
to dart his &s;pear at Capt. Cook, who was thereupon forced to fire in his own defence; but he mi&s;&s;ed the per&s;on he aimed at, and happened to kill another clo&s;e to him, who was equally forward in the tumult. The &s;erjeant ob&s;erving to him that he had mi&s;&s;ed the man he aimed at, received or|ders to fire at him, which he immediately did, and killed him. The impetuo&s;ity of the i&s;landers was by this time &s;omewhat repre&s;&s;ed, they fell back &s;eemingly in confu&s;ion, but being pu&s;hed on by tho&s;e behind, returned to the charge, and poured a volley of &s;tones among the marines, who, with|out waiting for orders, returned it with a general di&s;charge of mu&s;quetry, which was in&s;tantly fol|lowed by a fire from the boats.</P>
<P>At this Captain Cook was heard to expre&s;s his a&s;toni&s;hment; he waved his hand to the boats, cal|led to them to cea&s;e firing, and bade them come nearer in to receive the marines.&mdash;What followed after this &s;eems to have been a &s;cene of confu&s;ion. After the marines had fired, the Indians ru&s;hed among them, and forced them into the water, where four of them were killed. Their lieutenant was wounded, but fortunately e&s;caped, and was taken up by the pinnace. "Captain Cook, who was then the only one remaining on the rock, was ob&s;erved making for the pinnace, holding his left hand again&s;t the back of his head, to guard it from the &s;tones, and carrying his mu&s;quet under the other arm. An Indian who had followed him, but with caution and timidity, at la&s;t advanced upon him unawares, and with a large club<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Some have &s;aid, that he received the fir&s;t injury from a dagger. The account here given, is that of Mr. Samwell, who publi&s;hed a relation of this melancholy affair, which &s;eems to be written with great preci&s;ion and accuracy.</NOTE> or &s;take, gave him a blow on the back of the head, and then
<PB N="39" REF="030274_1270_0FE577ECFB97E3D0">
precipitately retreated. By this &s;troke, Captain Cook &s;eemed to be &s;tunned, he &s;taggered a few paces, then fell on his hand and one knee, and dropped his mu&s;quet. As he was ri&s;ing, and be|fore he could recover his feet, another Indian &s;tab|bed him in the back of the neck with an iron dag|ger. He then fell in a bite of water about knee deep, where others crowded upon him, and en|deavoured to keep him under; but &s;truggling very &s;trongly with them, he got his head up, and ca&s;t|ing his look towards the pinnace, &s;eemed to &s;olicit a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Though the boat was not above five or &s;ix yards from him, yet from the crowded and confu&s;ed &s;tate of the crew, it &s;eems it was not in their power to &s;ave him.&mdash; The Indians got him under again, but in deeper water; he was, how|ever, able to get his head up once more, and be|ing almo&s;t &s;pent in the &s;truggle, he naturally turn|ed to the rock, and was endeavouring to &s;upport him&s;elf by it, when a &s;avage gave him a blow with a club, and he was &s;een alive no more.&mdash;They hauled him lifele&s;s upon the rocks, where they &s;eemed to take a &s;avage plea&s;ure in u&s;ing every barbarity to his dead body, &s;natching the daggers out of each others hands, to have the horrid &s;atis|faction of piercing the fallen victim of their bar|barous rage."</P>
<P>Thus peri&s;hed, in the fifty-fir&s;t year of his age, this truly eminent and valuable man, equally di&s;|tingui&s;hed for his &s;kill as a navigator, and for the heroic con&s;tancy and firmne&s;s of his mind. In whatever point of view we con&s;ider his character, we &s;hall find ju&s;t &s;ubject for admiration. Cool and deliberate in judging, &s;agacious in determin|ing, active in executing, and per&s;evering in his enterprizes, he &s;upported labors, overcame diffi|culties, and encountered dangers, which &s;eldom
<PB N="40" REF="030274_1271_0FE57756EEC43AA0">
fall to the lot of one man. Though rigid in di&s;ci|pline, he was mild, ju&s;t and humane; and his people, to whom he was a father, were obedient to him, rather from motives of affection than fear. &mdash;His con&s;titution was &s;trong, and his mode of living temperate. He was mode&s;t, and rather re|&s;erved in company; but among tho&s;e with whom he was acquainted, he was found to be a lively, &s;en&s;ible and intelligent companion. His per&s;on was about &s;ix feet high, and though a good look|ing man, he was plain both in addre&s;s and appear|ance. His head was &s;mall; his hair, which was dark brown, he wore tied behind. His face was full of expre&s;&s;ion, his no&s;e exceedingly well &s;haped, his eyes, which were &s;mall, and of a brown ca&s;t, were quick and piercing, and his eyebrows were prominent, which gave his countenance altogether an air of au&s;terity.</P>

Behm, who had accompanied them to our &s;hips; we &s;hall now recount the tran&s;actions which pa&s;&s;ed at Petropaulow&s;ka during their ab&s;ence.</P>
<P>On the 7th of May, not long after they had quitted the bay of Awat&s;ka, a great piece of ice drove again&s;t the Re&s;olution, and brought home the &s;mall bower anchor; in con&s;equence of which the other anchor was weighed, and the &s;hip was moored again. The carpenters, who were occupi|ed in &s;topping the leak, were under the nece&s;&s;ity of taking off great part of the &s;heathing from the bows; and many of the trunnels were found to be &s;o loo&s;e and rotten, that they were drawn out ea&s;ily with the fingers. On Tue&s;day the 11th, heavy gales blew from the north-ea&s;t, which obliged both our ve&s;&s;els to &s;trike their yards and top-ma&s;ts; but the weather becoming more mo|derate in the afternoon and the ice having drifted away as far as the mouth of the harbour of Pe|tropaulow&s;ka, we warped clo&s;e to the &s;hore for the greater convenience of procuring wood and water, and again moored, as before; the mouth of the bay &s;hut in by the mo&s;t &s;outherly point of Ra|kowina harbour, bearing &s;outh, and the town north half we&s;t, at the di&s;tance of half a mile.</P>
<P>On the 12th, a party was detached on &s;hore to cut wood, but made little progre&s;s in that &s;er|vice, on account of the &s;now, which &s;till covered the ground. A convenient &s;pot, abrea&s;t of the &s;hips, was cleared, where there was a good run
<PB N="3" REF="030274_1291_0FE5786D1F992068">
of water; and a tent being pitched for the cooper, our empty ca&s;ks were landed, and the &s;ail-makers &s;ent a&s;hore.</P>
<P>On Saturday the 15th, as the beach was then clear of ice, a party was &s;ent to haul the &s;eine, and caught a plentiful &s;upply of fine flat fi&s;h for the companies of both &s;hips. From this time, indeed, till we quitted the harbour, we were even overpowered with the great quantities of fi&s;h which came in from every quarter. The <HI>Toions,</HI> both of this town, and of Paratounca, a neigh|bouring village, had received orders from Major Bemh to employ, in our &s;ervice, all the Kamt&s;cha|dales; &s;o that it frequently happened, that we could not take into the &s;hips the pre&s;ents which were &s;ent us. They generally con&s;i&s;ted of herrings, trout, flat fi&s;h, and cod. The former, which were in their highe&s;t perfection, and of a delicious fla|vour, were in extreme plenty in this bay. The people of the Di&s;covery, at one time &s;urrounded &s;uch an amazing quantity in their &s;eine, that they were obliged to throw over a very con&s;iderable number, le&s;t the net &s;hould be broken to pieces; and the cargo they landed was &s;till &s;o abundant, that, be&s;ides having a &s;ufficient &s;tock for immedi|ate u&s;e, they filled as many ca&s;ks as they could conveniently &s;pare for &s;alting; and, after &s;ending on board the Re&s;olution a tolerable quantity for the &s;ame purpo&s;e, they left behind &s;everal bu&s;hels upon the beach.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="030274_1292_0FE578576232E9D0">The ice and &s;now now began rapidly to di&s;ap|pear, and plenty of nettle-tops, celery, and wild garlick were gathered for the u&s;e of the crews; which being boiled with portable &s;oup and wheat, furni&s;hed them with an excellent and &s;alutary breakfa&s;t; and with this they were every morn|ing &s;upplied. The birch-trees were al&s;o tapped, and the &s;weet juice, of which they produced great quantities, was con&s;tantly mixed with the brandy allowed to the men.</P>
<P>On the 16th, a &s;mall bullock was killed, which the &s;erjeant had procured for the &s;hip's compa|nies. Its weight was two hundred and &s;eventy|two pounds. It was &s;erved out to both the crews for their Sunday's dinner, and was the fir&s;t fre&s;h beef which they had ta&s;ted &s;ince the depar|ture of our ve&s;&s;els from the Cape of Good Hope in December 1776; a period of almo&s;t two years and a half.</P>
<P>John Macinto&s;h, the carpenter's mate, expired this evening, after having been afflicted with a dy&s;entery ever &s;ince we had left the Sandwich I&s;les. He was a peaceable and indu&s;trious man, and greatly regretted by his me&s;s-mates. Though he was the fourth per&s;on that we had lo&s;t by &s;ick|ne&s;s during our voyage, he was the fir&s;t who, from his age and con&s;titution, could be &s;aid to have had, on our &s;etting out, an equal chance of life with the re&s;t of his companions. Watman was &s;uppo&s;ed by us to be about &s;ixty years old;
<PB N="5" REF="030274_1293_0FE5782CD352ABA8">
and Roberts, and Mr. Ander&s;on from the decline which had manife&s;tly commenced before our de|parture from England, mo&s;t probably could not, under any circum&s;tances, have lived to a later pe|riod than they did.</P>
<P>Captain Clerke's health continued daily to de|cline, notwith&s;tanding the &s;alutary change of diet which Kamt&s;chatka afforded him, the prie&s;t of Pa|ratounca, as &s;oon as he was informed of the weak &s;tate he was in, &s;upplied him every day with milk, bread, fowls, and fre&s;h butter, though his habi|tation was &s;ixteen miles from the harbour where our &s;hips were &s;tationed.</P>
<P>The Ru&s;&s;ian ho&s;pital, near the town of St. Pe|ter and St. Paul, was, at our fir&s;t arrival, in a very deplorable &s;tate. All the &s;oldiers were in a greater or le&s;&s;er degree, afflicted with the &s;curvy, many being in the la&s;t &s;tage of that di&s;order. The re&s;t of the Ru&s;&s;ian inhabitants were likewi&s;e in a &s;imilar condition; and we ob&s;erved, that our friend the &s;erjeant, by drinking too freely of the &s;pirits he had received from us, had brought on him&s;elf, in the cour&s;e of a few days, &s;everal of the mo&s;t alarming &s;ymptoms of that di&s;ea&s;e. Cap|tain Clerke, de&s;irous of relieving them from this lamentable &s;tate, put them all under the care of our &s;urgeons, and gave orders, that a &s;upply of &s;our krout, and malt, for wort, &s;hould be fur|ni&s;hed for their u&s;e. A &s;urpri&s;ing alteration &s;oon took place in the figures of mo&s;t of them; and
<PB N="6" REF="030274_1294_0FE5783FC10E8200">
their &s;peedy recovery was chiefly attributed to the effects of the &s;weet wort.</P>
<P>On Tuesday the fir&s;t of June, two hundred and fifty poods or nine thou&s;and pounds weight of rye flour, were brought on board the Re&s;olution; and the Di&s;covery received a proportional quan|tity. We were &s;upplied with this flour from the &s;tores of Petropaulow&s;ka. The men were now put on their full allowance of bread, which, from the time of our leaving the Cape of Good Hope, they had not been indulged in. The &s;ame day, we completed our &s;tock of water, &s;ixty-five tons having been conveyed on board.</P>
<P>We had fre&s;h breezes, and heavy rains, on the 4th of June, &s;o that we were di&s;appointed in our de&s;ign of dre&s;&s;ing the &s;hips, and obliged to content our&s;elves with firing one and twenty guns, in ho|nour of his Maje&s;ty's birth-day, and celebrating it, in other re&s;pects, in the be&s;t manner we could. Port, who on account of his &s;kill in languages, was left with us, partook, as well as the &s;erjeants (in the capacity of commandant of the place) of the entertainment of the day. The worthy prie&s;t of Paratounca, having been informed that it was the anniver&s;ary of our &s;overeign's birth-day, gave likewi&s;e a &s;umptuous fea&s;t, at which &s;everal of our gentlemen were pre&s;ent, who were highly plea&s;ed with their entertainment, of which dancing formed a part.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="030274_1295_0FE57849E6375728">On Sunday the 6th, twenty head of cattle ar|rived, having been &s;ent us, by the directions of the commander, from the Verchni <HI>o&s;trog,</HI> which &s;tands on the river Kamt&s;chatka, at the di&s;tance of almo&s;t a hundred miles from this place. The&s;e cattle were of a moderate &s;ize; and though the Kamt&s;chadales had been &s;eventeen days in driving them down to the harbour, were in good condition when they arrived. The four &s;ucceeding days were employed in making preparations for putting to &s;ea; and on Friday the 11th, about two o'clock in the morning, we began to unmoor. Before, however, we had got up one anchor, &s;o violent a gale &s;prung up from the north-ea&s;t, that we thought proper to moor again, &s;uppo&s;ing, from the po&s;ition of the entrance of the bay, that the current of wind would, in all probability, &s;et up the channel. The pinnace was di&s;patched to exa|mine the pa&s;&s;age, and returned with intelligence, that the wind blew violently from the &s;outh-ea&s;t, with a great &s;well, &s;etting into the bay; &s;o that any attempt to get out to &s;ea would have been at|tended with con&s;iderable ri&s;que.</P>
<P>Port now took his leave of us, carrying with him the box containing the journals of our voyage, which Major Behm was to take charge of, and the packet that was to be forwarded by expre&s;s. On the 12th, the gale having abated, we began unmooring again; but, after having broken the
<PB N="8" REF="030274_1296_0FE548E599C0BE30">
me&s;&s;enger, and reeved a running purcha&s;e with a &s;ix inch haw&s;er, which likewi&s;e broke three times, we were, at la&s;t, under the nece&s;&s;ity of heaving a &s;train at low water, and waiting for the flowing of the tide to rai&s;e the anchor. This mea&s;ure &s;ucceeded, though not without damaging the cable. About three o'clock in the afternoon, the be&s;t bower was weighed, and we &s;et &s;ail; but, at eight, the tide making again&s;t us, and the wind being incon&s;iderable, we anchored again in ten fathoms water, off the mouth of Rako|wina harbour: the <HI>o&s;trog</HI> being at the di&s;tance of between two and three miles, bearing north by ea&s;t half ea&s;t; the elevated rock, on the we&s;tern &s;ide of the pa&s;&s;age, bearing &s;outh; and the needle rocks, on the ea&s;tern &s;ide of the pa&s;&s;age, &s;outh-&s;outh-ea&s;t half ea&s;t.</P>
<P>The next morning, at four o'clock, we got under way with the tide of ebb; and, as there was a perfect calm, the boats were di&s;patched a-head for the purpo&s;e of towing the &s;hips. About ten, a &s;outh-ea&s;terly wind &s;pringing up, and the tide having turned, we were obliged to let go our anchors again, in &s;even fathoms; the <HI>o&s;trog</HI> bearing north half ea&s;t, at the di&s;tance of a mile from the land that was neare&s;t to us; and the three needle rocks being in the direction of &s;outh half ea&s;t.</P>
<P>Captain Gore and Lieutenant King landed in the afternoon on the ea&s;t &s;ide of the pa&s;&s;age.
<PB N="9" REF="030274_1297_0FE5784212DDAE70">
where they ob&s;erved, in two different places, the remains of &s;pacious villages; and, on the &s;ide of a hill, they &s;aw an old ruined parapet, with four or five embra&s;ures. It had guns mounted on it in Beering's time, as that navigator him&s;elf in|forms us; and commanded the pa&s;&s;age up the mouth of the bay. Not far from this &s;pot, were the ruins of &s;ome &s;ubterraneous caverns, which our two gentlemen conjectured to have been ma|gazines.</P>
<P>We weighed anchor, with the ebb tide, about &s;ix o'clock in the afternoon, and turned to wind|ward; but, two hours after, a thick fog coming on, we were under the nece&s;&s;ity of bringing to, our &s;oundings not affording us a &s;ufficient direc|tion for &s;teering between &s;everal &s;unken <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ocks, &s;ituated on each &s;ide of the pa&s;&s;age we were to make. The next morning (Monday the 14th) the fog in &s;ome degree di&s;per&s;ing, we weighed as &s;oon as the tide began to ebb; and, there being little wind, the boats were &s;ent a-head to tow; but, about ten o'clock, both the wind and tide &s;et in &s;o &s;trong from the &s;ea, that we were once more obliged to ca&s;t anchor, in thir|teen fathoms water, the high rock being at the di&s;tance of &s;ix furlongs, in the direction of we&s;t one quarter &s;outh. We continued, during the re|mainder of the day, in this &s;ituation, the wind blowing fre&s;h into the mouth of the bay. To|wards
<PB N="10" REF="030274_1298_0FE57858E5181030">
the evening, the weather was extremely dark and cloudy with an un&s;ettled wind.</P>
<P>We were &s;urprized, before day-light, on the 15th, with a rumbling noi&s;e, that re&s;embled di&s;|tant thunder; and, when the day appeared, we found that the &s;ides and decks of our &s;hips were covered, near an inch thick, with a fine du&s;t like emery. The air was at the &s;ame time loaded and ob&s;cured with this &s;ub&s;tance; and, towards the volcano mountain, which &s;tands to the north|ward of the harbour, it was exceeding thick and black, in&s;omuch that we were unable to di&s;tin|gui&s;h the body of the hill. About twelve o'clock, and during the afternoon, the loudne&s;s of the ex|plo&s;ions increa&s;ed; and they were &s;ucceeded by &s;howers of cinders, which in general were of the &s;ize of peas, though many of tho&s;e that were picked up from the deck were larger than a hazel nut. Several &s;mall &s;tones, which had undergone no alteration from the action of the fire, fell with the cinders. In the evening we had dreadful claps of thunder and vivid fla&s;hes of lightning, which, with the darkne&s;s of the &s;ky, and the &s;ulphureous &s;mell of the air, produced a very awful and tremendous effect. Our di&s;tance from the foot of the mountain was, at this time, about eight leagues.</P>
<P>At day-break on the 16th, we got up our an|chors, and &s;tood out of the bay; but the wind falling, and the tide of ebb &s;etting acro&s;s the pa&s;|&s;age
<PB N="11" REF="030274_1299_0FE57863CD64D158">
on the ea&s;tern &s;hore, we were driven very near the three needle rocks, &s;ituated on that &s;ide of the entrance, and were under the nece&s;&s;ity of hoi&s;ting out the boats, for the purpo&s;e of towing the &s;hips clear of them. At twelve o'clock, we were at the di&s;tance of &s;ix miles from the land; and our depth of water was forty three fathoms, over a bottom of &s;mall &s;tones, of the &s;ame kind with tho&s;e which had fallen upon our decks, after the late eruption of the volcano.</P>
<P>The country had now a very different appear|ance from what it had on our fir&s;t arrival. The &s;now, except what remained on the &s;ummits of &s;ome very lofty mountains, had vani&s;hed; and the &s;ides of the hills, which abounded with wood in many parts, were covered with a beautiful verdure.</P>
<P>It being the intention of Captain Clerke to keep in &s;ight of the coa&s;t of Kamt&s;chatka, as much as the weather would allow, in order to a&s;|certain its po&s;ition, we continued to &s;teer towards the north-north-ea&s;t, with variable light winds, till the 18th. The volcano was &s;till ob&s;erved to throw up immen&s;e volumes of &s;moke; and we did not &s;trike ground with one hundred and fifty fathoms of line, at the di&s;tance of twelve miles from the &s;hore.</P>
<P>The wind blew fre&s;h from the &s;outh on the 18th and the weather became &s;o thick and hazy, that it was imprudent to make any further attempts at
<PB N="12" REF="030274_1300_0FE5785ACA0619E0">
pre&s;ent to keep in &s;ight of the land. However, that we might be ready, whenever the fog &s;hould clear up, to a&s;&s;ume our &s;urvey, we ran on in the direction of the coa&s;t, (as repre&s;ented in the Ru&s;|&s;ian charts) and fired &s;ignal guns for the Di&s;co|very to proceed on the &s;ame cour&s;e. At eleven o'clock, ju&s;t before we lo&s;t &s;ight of land, Chee|poon&s;koi No&s;s, &s;o denominated by the Ru&s;&s;ians, was at the di&s;tance of &s;even or eight leagues, bearing north-north-ea&s;t.</P>
<P>At three o'clock in the morning of the 20th, the weather becoming clearer, we &s;tood in to|wards the land, and, in the &s;pace of an hour af|terwards, &s;aw it a-head, extending from north-we&s;t to north-north-ea&s;t, at the di&s;tance of about five leagues. The northern part we conjectured to be Kronot&s;koi No&s;s; its po&s;ition in the Ru&s;|&s;ian charts, nearly agreeing with our reckoning in re&s;pect to its latitude, which was 54&deg; 42&prime; north; though, in point of longitude, we differed con|&s;iderably from them; for they place it 1&deg; 48&prime; ea&s;t of Awat&s;ka; whereas our computation makes it 3&deg; 34&prime; ea&s;t of that place, or 162&deg; 17&prime; ea&s;t of Green|wich. The land about this cape is very elevated, and the inland mountains were at this time cover|ed with &s;now. There is no appearance of inlets or bays in the coa&s;t; and the &s;hore breaks off in &s;teep cliffs.</P>
<P>We had not long been gratified with this view of the land, when the wind fre&s;hened from the
<PB N="13" REF="030274_1301_0FE5784E6F1E83E8">
&s;outh-we&s;t, bringing on a thick fog, which obliged us to &s;tand off in the direction of north-ea&s;t by ea&s;t.</P>
<P>The fog di&s;per&s;ing about noon, we again &s;teer|ed for the land, expecting to fall in with Kam|&s;chat&s;koi No&s;s, and gained a &s;ight of it at day|break on the 21&s;t. The &s;outh-we&s;t wind being &s;oon after &s;ucceeded by a light breeze that blew off the land, we were prevented from approach|ing the coa&s;t &s;ufficiently near to determine its direction, or de&s;cribe its a&s;pect. At twelve o'clock, our longitude was 163&deg; 50&prime;, and our la|titude 55&deg; 52&prime;; the extremes of the land bore north-we&s;t by we&s;t&punc; &frac34; we&s;t, and north by we&s;t &frac34; we&s;t; and the neare&s;t part was at the di&s;tance of about twenty-four miles.</P>
<P>At nine in the evening, when we had approach|ed about &s;ix miles nearer the coa&s;t, it appeared to form a projecting penin&s;ula, and to extend eleven or twelve leagues in the direction nearly of north and &s;outh. It is level, and of a mode|rate elevation; the &s;outhern extreme terminates in a low &s;loping point; that to the northward forms a &s;teep bluff head; and between them, ten or twelve miles to the &s;outh of the northern cape, there is a con&s;iderable break in the land. On both &s;ides of this break, the land is low. A re|markable hill, re&s;embling a &s;addle, ri&s;es beyond the opening; and a chain of lofty mountains capped with &s;now, extends along the back of the whole penin&s;ula.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="030274_1302_0FE5789D01323A88">The coa&s;t running in an even direction, we were uncertain with re&s;pect to the po&s;ition of Kamt&s;chat&s;koi No&s;s, which, according to Mr. Muller, forms a projecting point towards the mid|dle of the penin&s;ula; but we afterwards found, that, in a late Ru&s;&s;ian map, that appellation is given to the &s;outhern cape. The latitude of this from &s;everal accurate ob&s;ervations, was 56&deg; 3&prime;; and its longitude, 163&deg; 20&prime;. To the &s;outh of this penin&s;ula, the greater river Kamt&s;chat&s;ka runs into the &s;ea.</P>
<P>The &s;ea&s;on being too far advanced for us to make an accurate &s;urvey of the coa&s;t of Kamt&s;|chatka, it was the de&s;ign of Captain Clerke, in our cour&s;e to Beering's Straights, to a&s;certain chiefly the re&s;pective &s;ituations of the projecting points of the coa&s;t. We therefore &s;teered acro&s;s a &s;pacious bay, laid down between Kamt&s;chat|&s;koi No&s;s and Olutor&s;koi No&s;s, with a view of making the latter; which is repre&s;ented by the Ru&s;&s;ian geographers, as terminating the penin&s;ula of Kamt&s;chatka, and as being the &s;outhern limit of the country of the Koriacs.</P>
<P>On Tue&s;day the 22d, we pa&s;&s;ed a dead whale, which emitted a mo&s;t horrible &s;mell, perceivable at the di&s;tance of three or four miles. It was covered with a very con&s;iderable number of gulls, petrels, and other oceanic birds, which were re|galing them&s;elves upon it. On the 24th, the wind, which had &s;hifted about during the three
<PB N="15" REF="030274_1303_0FE5785582012730">
preceding days, &s;ettled at &s;outh-we&s;t, bringing on clear weather, with which we proceeded to|wards the north-ea&s;t by north, acro&s;s the bay, having no land in &s;ight. In the cour&s;e of this day we ob&s;erved a great number of gulls, and were di&s;gu&s;ted with the indelicate manner of feeding of the arctic gull, which has procured it the appellation of the para&s;ite. This bird, which is rather larger than the common gull, pur&s;ues the latter &s;pecies whenever it meets them; the gull after flying about for &s;ome time, with loud &s;creams and manife&s;t indications of extreme terror, drops its excrement, which its pur&s;uer in&s;tantly darts at, and catches in its beak before it falls into the &s;ea.</P>
<P>At one o'clock in the afternoon of the 25th, when we were in the latitude of 59&deg; 12&prime;, and in the longitude of 168&deg; 35&prime;, a very thick fog came on, about the time we expected to obtain a view of Olutor&s;koi No&s;s, which (if Muller's po&s;ition of it, in the latitude 59&deg; 30&prime;, and in the lon|gitude of 167&deg; 36&prime;, is right) could then have been only a dozen leagues from us; at which di&s;|tance we might ea&s;ily have di&s;cerned land of a moderate height. Our depth of water, at pre|&s;ent, was &s;o great, that we had no ground with a hundred and &s;ixty fathoms of line.</P>
<P>The fog &s;till continuing, prevented us from making a nearer approach to the land, and we &s;teered ea&s;t by north at five o'clock, which is a lit|tle more ea&s;terly than the Ru&s;&s;ian charts repre&s;ent
<PB N="16" REF="030274_1304_0FE57860C0578258">
the trending of the coa&s;t from Olutor&s;koi No&s;s. The next day, a fre&s;h gale blew from the &s;outh-we&s;t, which la&s;ted till noon on the 27th, when the weather clearing up, we &s;teered to the north, with an intention of making the land. Our lati|tude, at this time, was 59&deg; 49&prime;, and our longi|tude 175&deg; 43&prime;. Though we &s;aw &s;ome &s;hags in the morning, which are imagined never to fly far from land, yet there was no appearance of it during the whole day. However, the next morning, about &s;ix o'clock, we had &s;ight of it towards the north-we&s;t. The coa&s;t appeared in hills of mo|derate elevation; but, inland, others were ob|&s;erved con&s;iderably higher. The &s;now lying in patches, and no wood being perceived, the land had a very barren a&s;pect.</P>
<P>At nine o'clock, we were ten or eleven miles from the &s;hore, the &s;outhern extreme bearing we&s;t by &s;outh, about &s;ix leagues di&s;tant, beyond which the coa&s;t &s;eemed to incline to the we&s;t. This point being in the longitude of 174&deg; 48&prime;, and in the latitude 61&deg; 48&prime;, is &s;ituated, according to the Ru&s;&s;ian charts, near the mouth of the river Opuka. The northern extremity, at the &s;ame time bore north by we&s;t; between which, and a hill bearing north-we&s;t by we&s;t we&s;t, the coa&s;t appeared to bend towards the we&s;t, and form a deep bay.</P>
<P>At the di&s;tance of about eight miles from the land, we ob&s;erved a &s;trong rippling; and being
<PB N="17" REF="030274_1305_0FE5785056FF5440">
under apprehen&s;ions of meeting with foul ground, we made &s;ail to the north-ea&s;t, along the coa&s;t. On heaving the lead, we found the depth of wa|ter to be twenty-four fathoms, over a bottom of gravel. We therefore concluded, that the ap|pearance above-mentioned, was occa&s;ioned by a tide, then running to the &s;outhward. At noon, the extremes of the land bearing we&s;t-&s;outh-we&s;t and north-north-ea&s;t, we were abrea&s;t of the low land, which, we now ob&s;erved, joined the two points, where we had before expected to di&s;cover a deep bay. The coa&s;t bends a little towards the we&s;t, and has a &s;mall inlet, which is, perhaps, the mouth of &s;ome incon&s;iderable river. Our longitude was now 175&deg; 43&prime;, and our latitude 61&deg; 36&prime;.</P>
<P>During the afternoon, we continued our cour&s;e along the coa&s;t, at the di&s;tance of four or five leagues, with a breeze from the we&s;t, having re|gular &s;oundings from twenty-eight to thirty-&s;ix fathoms. The coa&s;t exhibited an appearance of &s;terility, and the hills ro&s;e to a con&s;iderable ele|vation inland, but the clouds on their tops pre|vented us from determining their height. About eight o'clock in the evening, &s;ome of our people thought they &s;aw land to the ea&s;t by north; upon which we &s;tood to the &s;outhward of ea&s;t; but it proved to be nothing more than a fog bank. At midnight, the extreme point bearing north-ea&s;t ea&s;t, we conjectured that it was St. Thadeus's
<PB N="18" REF="030274_1306_0FE5786EA578F8C8">
No&s;s; to the &s;outh of which the land inclines to|wards the we&s;t, forming a deep bight, wherein the river Katirka, according to the charts publi&s;hed by the Ru&s;&s;ians, is &s;ituate.</P>
<P>The weather, on the 29th, was un&s;ettled, with the wind at the north-ea&s;t point. The next day, at twelve o'clock, our longitude was 180&deg;, and our latitude 61&deg; 48&prime;. At this time, St. Thadeus's No&s;s bore north-north-we&s;t, at the di&s;tance of twenty-three leagues; and beyond it we perceiv|ed the coa&s;t extending almo&s;t directly north. The ea&s;ternmo&s;t point of the No&s;s is in the latitude 62&deg; 50&prime;, and in the longitude of 179&deg;. The land about it, from its being di&s;cerned at &s;o great a di&s;tance, may ju&s;tly be &s;uppo&s;ed to be of a con|&s;iderable height. During this and the preceding day, we &s;aw numbers of &s;ea-hor&s;es, whales, and &s;eals; al&s;o albatro&s;&s;es, gulls, &s;ea-parrots, guil|lemots, &amp;c. Taking the advantage of a little calm weather, &s;everal of our people employed them&s;elves in fi&s;hing, and caught plenty of excel|lent cod. Our &s;oundings were from &s;ixty-five to &s;eventy-five fathoms.</P>
<P>At noon, on Thur&s;day the fir&s;t of July, Mr. Bligh, Ma&s;ter of the Re&s;olution, having moored a &s;mall keg with the deep &s;ea lead, in &s;eventy-five fathoms water, found that the &s;hip made a cour&s;e to the north by ea&s;t, about half a mile in an hour: this was attributed by him to the effect of a &s;outherly &s;well, rather than to that of any

current. The wind, towards the evening, fre&s;h|ening from the &s;outh-ea&s;t, we &s;teered to north-ea&s;t by ea&s;t, for the point that Beering calls T&s;chukot&s;koi No&s;s, which we had ob&s;erved on the 4th of September the preceding year, at the &s;ame time that we perceived, towards the &s;outh-ea&s;t, the I&s;le of St. Lawrence. This cape, and St. Thadeus's No&s;s, from the north-ea&s;tern and &s;outh-we&s;tern extremes of the exten&s;ive Gulph of Anadir, into the bottom of which the river of that name di&s;charges it&s;elf, &s;eparating, as it pa&s;&s;es, the country of the T&s;chut&s;ki from that of the Koriacs.</P>
<P>On the 3d of July, at twelve o'clock, our la|titude was 63&deg; 33&prime;, and our longitude 186&deg; 45&prime;. Between twelve and one, we de&s;cried the T&s;chu|kot&s;koi No&s;s, bearing north half we&s;t, at the di&s;|tance of thirteen or fourteen leagues. At five in the afternoon, we &s;aw the i&s;land of St. Law|rence, in the direction of ea&s;t three-quarters north; and al&s;o another i&s;land, which we imagined was between St. Lawrence and Ander&s;on's I&s;land, about eighteen miles ea&s;t-&s;outh-ea&s;t of the for|mer. As we had no certain knowledge of this i&s;land, Captain Clerke was inclined to have a nearer view of it, and immediately hauled the wind towards it: but it unfortunately happened, that we were unable to weather the I&s;le of St. Lawrence, and were therefore obliged to bear up again, and pa&s;s them all to the leeward.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="030274_1308_0FE5787A5DA733A8">The latitude of the I&s;land of St. Lawrence, according to the mo&s;t accurate ob&s;ervations, is 63&deg; 47&prime;; and its longitude is 188&deg; 15&prime;. This i&s;land, if its boundaries were at pre&s;ent within our view, is about three leagues in circumference. The northern part of it may be di&s;cerned at the di&s;tance of ten or a dozen leagues. As it has &s;ome low land to the &s;outh-ea&s;t, the extent of which we could not perceive, &s;ome of us &s;up|po&s;ed, that it might perhaps be joined to the land to the ea&s;tward of it: we were, however, pre|vented by the hazine&s;s of the weather, from a&s;|certaining this circum&s;tance. The&s;e i&s;lands, as well as the land adjoining to the T&s;chukot&s;koi No&s;s, were covered with &s;now, and pre&s;ented a mo&s;t di&s;mal a&s;pect. About midnight, the I&s;le of St. Lawrence was five or &s;ix miles di&s;tant, bear|ing &s;outh-&s;outh-ea&s;t; and our &s;oundings were eighteen fathoms. We were accompanied with &s;ea fowl of various &s;orts, and ob&s;erved &s;ome guil|lemots and &s;mall cre&s;ted hawks.</P>
<P>As the weather continued to thicken, we lo&s;t &s;ight of land till Monday the 5th, when we had a view of it both to the north-ea&s;t and north-we&s;t. Our longitude, at this time, was 189&deg; 14&prime;, and our latitude 65&deg; 24&prime;. As the i&s;lands of St. Dio|mede, which are &s;ituated in Beering's Straight, between the two continents of A&s;ia and America, were determined by us the preceeding year to be in the latitude of 95&deg; 48&prime;, we were at a lo&s;s how
<PB N="21" REF="030274_1309_0FE578BE48A45378">
to reconcile the land towards the north-ea&s;t, with the po&s;ition of tho&s;e i&s;lands. We therefore &s;tood for the land till three o'clock in the afternoon, when we were within the di&s;tance of four miles from it, and di&s;covering it to be two i&s;lands, were pretty well convinced of their being the &s;ame; but the hazine&s;s of the weather &s;till continuing, we, in order to be certain, with re&s;pect to our &s;ituation, &s;tood over to the A&s;iatic coa&s;t, till about &s;even o'clock in the evening; at which time we had approached within two or three leagues of the ea&s;tern cape of that continent.</P>
<P>This cape is an elevated round head of land, and extends about five miles from north to &s;outh. It forms a penin&s;ula, which is connected with the continent by a narrow i&s;thmus of low land. It has a bold &s;hore; and three lofty, detached, &s;pi|ral rocks, are &s;een off its north part. It was at pre&s;ent covered with &s;now, and the beach encom|pa&s;&s;ed with ice. We were now convinced of our having been under the influence of a &s;trong cur|rent &s;etting to the northward, which had occa&s;i|oned an error of twenty miles in our computa|tion of the latitude at noon. At the time of our pa&s;&s;ing this Straight the la&s;t year, we had experi|enced a &s;imilar effect.</P>
<P>Being now certain with regard to our po&s;ition, we &s;teered north by ea&s;t. At ten o'clock in the evening, the weather clearing up, we &s;aw, at the &s;ame in&s;tant, the remarkable peaked hill near
<PB N="22" REF="030274_1310_0FE57865D9F5ACF8">
Cape Prince of Wales, on the North American coa&s;t, and the Ea&s;t Cape of A&s;ia, with the two i&s;lands of St. Diomede between them.</P>
<P>In the cour&s;e of this day, we &s;aw &s;everal large white gulls, and great numbers of very &s;mall birds of the hawk kind. The beak of the latter was compre&s;&s;ed, and large in proportion to the body of the bird; the colour was dark brown, or rather black, the brea&s;t whiti&s;h, and towards the abdomen a reddi&s;h brown hue was vi&s;ible.</P>
<P>On the 6th, at twelve o'clock, our latitude was 67&deg;, and our longitude 191&deg; 6&prime;. Having al|ready pa&s;&s;ed many large ma&s;&s;es of ice, and ob|&s;erved that it adhered, in &s;everal places, to the &s;hore of the A&s;iatic continent, we were not great|ly &s;urpri&s;ed when we fell in, about three o'clock, with an exten&s;ive body of it, &s;tretching towards the we&s;t. This appearance con&s;iderably di&s;cou|raged our hopes of proceeding much further to the north this year, than we had done the pre|ceding. There being little wind in the after|noon, the boats were hoi&s;ted out in pur&s;uit of the &s;ea-hor&s;es, great numbers of which were &s;een on the detached pieces of ice; but they returned without &s;ucce&s;s: the&s;e animals being extremely &s;hy, and, before our people could come within gun-&s;hot of them, always retreated into the water.</P>
<P>Having hoi&s;ted in the boats at &s;even o'clock in the evening, we &s;tood on to the north-ea&s;t-ward,
<PB N="23" REF="030274_1311_0FE578B39B811788">
with a fre&s;h &s;outherly breeze, intending to explore the American continent, between the la|titudes of 68&deg; and 69&deg;, which, on account of the foggy weather, we had not an opportunity of ex|amining the la&s;t year. In this attempt we were partly di&s;appointed again: for, on the 7th, about &s;ix o'clock in the morning, we were &s;topped by a large body of ice, &s;tretching from north-we&s;t to &s;outh-ea&s;t; but, not long afterwards, the horri|zon becoming clear, we had a view of the Ameri|can coa&s;t, at the di&s;tance of about ten leagues, extending from north-ea&s;t by ea&s;t to ea&s;t, and ly|ing between 68&deg; and 68&deg; 20&prime; of northern latitude. The ice not being high, we were enabled by the clearne&s;s of the weather to &s;ee over a great extent of it. The whole exhibited a compact &s;olid &s;urface, not in the lea&s;t thawed; and &s;eemed al&s;o to adhere to the land.</P>
<P>The weather becoming hazy &s;oon after, we lo&s;t &s;ight of the land; and it being impo&s;&s;ible to ap|proach nearer to it, we &s;teered to the north-north-we&s;t, keeping the ice clo&s;e on board; and having, by noon, got round its we&s;tern ex|tremity, we found that it trended nearly north. Our longitude, at this time, was 192&deg; 34&prime;, and our latitude 68&deg; 22&prime;. We proceeded along the edge of the ice, to the north-north-ea&s;t, during the remainder of the day, pa&s;&s;ing through many loo&s;e pieces which had been &s;eparated from the main body, and again&s;t which our ve&s;&s;els were
<PB N="24" REF="030274_1312_0FE578D65E3AB948">
driven with great violence, notwith&s;tanding our utmo&s;t caution. About eight in the evening, we pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome drift-wood: at midnight the wind veered to the north-we&s;t; and there were con|tinued &s;howers of &s;now and &s;leet. The thermo|meter had now fallen from 38&deg; to 31&deg;.</P>
<P>The next morning, at five o'clock, the wind &s;hifting more to the northward, we could conti|nue no longer on the &s;ame tack, by rea&s;on of the ice, but were under the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;tanding to|wards the we&s;t. Our depth of water, at this time was nineteen fathoms; from which, upon com|paring it with our remarks on the &s;oundings in the preceding year, we inferred, that our pre&s;ent di&s;tance from the coa&s;t of America did not exceed &s;ix or &s;even leagues; but our view was circum|&s;cribed within a much narrower compa&s;s, by a heavy fall of &s;now. Our latitude, at twelve o'clock, was 69&deg; 21&prime;, and our longitude 192&deg; 42&prime;.</P>
<P>At two in the afternoon, the weather became clearer, and we &s;ound our&s;elves clo&s;e to an ex|pan&s;e of ice, which from the ma&s;t-head, was di&s;|covered to con&s;i&s;t of very large compact bodies, united towards the exterior edge, but, in the in|terior parts, &s;ome pieces were ob&s;erved floating in vacant &s;paces of the water: it extended from we&s;t-&s;outh-we&s;t to north-ea&s;t by north. We bore away towards the &s;outh, along the edge of it, en|deavouring to get into clearer water; for the
<PB N="25" REF="030274_1313_0FE57843F6DF7088">
&s;trong northerly winds had drifted down &s;uch numbers of loo&s;e pieces, that we had been en|compa&s;&s;ed with them for &s;ome time, and were unable to prevent the &s;hips from &s;triking again&s;t &s;everal of them.</P>
<P>On Friday the 9th, a fre&s;h gale blew from the north-north-we&s;t, accompanied with violent &s;howers of &s;now and &s;leet. The thermometer, at noon, was at 30&deg;. We &s;teered we&s;t-&s;outh-we&s;t, and kept as near the main body of ice as we could; but had the misfortune to damage the cut-water again&s;t the drift pieces, and rub off &s;ome of the &s;heathing from the bows. The &s;hocks, indeed, which our &s;hips received, were frequently very &s;evere, and were attended with con&s;iderable ha|zard. Our latitude, at noon, was 69&deg; 12&prime;, and our longitude 188&deg; 5&prime;.</P>
<P>Having now &s;ailed almo&s;t forty leagues to the we&s;t, along the edge of the ice, without perceiv|ing any opening, or a clear &s;ea. beyond it towards the north, we had no pro&s;pect of making further progre&s;s to the northward at pre&s;ent. Captain Clerke, therefore, determined to bear away to the &s;outh by ea&s;t, the only quarter which was clear, and to wait till the &s;ea&s;on was &s;omewhat more advanced, before he made any further at|tempts, to penetrate through the ice. He pro|po&s;ed to employ the intermediate time in &s;urvey|ing the bay of St. Lawrence, and the coa&s;t &s;ituate to the &s;outh of it, as it would be a great &s;atis|faction
<PB N="26" REF="030274_1314_0FE5784CE82AE1F8">
to have a harbour &s;o near, in ca&s;e of fu|ture damage from the quantity of ice, in the&s;e parts. We were al&s;o de&s;irous of paying another vi&s;it to the T&s;chut&s;ki; and more particular &s;ince the acconuts we had heard of them from Major Behm.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of this determination, we made &s;ail to the &s;outhward, till the 10th at noon, when we pa&s;&s;ed con&s;iderable quantities of drift ice, and a perfect calm en&s;ued. The latitude, at this time, was 68&deg; 1&prime;, and the longitude, 188&deg; 30&prime;. This morning we &s;aw &s;everal whales, and in the afternoon, there being great numbers of &s;ea-hor&s;es on the pieces of ice that &s;urrounded us, we hoi&s;ted out the boats, and di&s;patched them in pur&s;uit of tho&s;e animals. Our people had more &s;ucce&s;s on this occa&s;ion, than they had on the 6th; for they returned with three large ones, and a young one, be&s;ides having killed or wounded &s;ome others. They were witne&s;&s;es of &s;everal &s;triking in&s;tances of parental affection in the&s;e animals. All of them, on the approach of the boats towards the ice, took their young ones un|der their fins, and attempted to e&s;cape with them into the &s;ea. Some, who&s;e cubs were killed or wounded, and left floating upon the &s;urface of the water, ro&s;e again, and carried them down, &s;ometimes ju&s;t as our men were on the point of taking them into the boat; and could be traced bearing them to a con&s;iderable di&s;tance through the
<PB N="27" REF="030274_1315_0FE5F7865E3F5110">
water, which was &s;tained with their blood. They were afterwards ob&s;erved bringing them, at inter|vals, above the &s;urface, as if for air, and again plunging under it, with a horrid bellowing. The female, in particular, who&s;e young one had been, killed, and taken into the boat, became &s;o furi|ous, that &s;he even &s;truck her two tu&s;ks through the bottom of the cutter.</P>
<P>About eight o'clock in the evening, an ea&s;terly breeze &s;prung up, with which we continued to &s;teer to the &s;outhward; and, at midnight, fell in with many exten&s;ive bodies of ice. We attempt|ed to pu&s;h through them under an ea&s;y &s;ail, that the &s;hips might &s;u&s;tain no damage; and when we had proceeded a little further towards the &s;outh, nothing was vi&s;ible but a very large and compact ma&s;s of ice, extending to the north-ea&s;t, &s;outh-we&s;t, and &s;outh-ea&s;t, as far as the eye could reach. This formidable ob&s;tacle prevented our vi&s;iting the T&s;chut&s;ki; for no &s;pace remained open, ex|cept back again to the northward. We therefore tacked, at three o'clock in the morning of the 11th, and &s;tood to that quarter. The latitude, at noon, was 67&deg; 49&prime;, and the longitude 188&deg; 47&prime;.</P>
<P>On Monday the 12th, we had light winds and hazy weather. On examining the current, we found it &s;et towards the north-we&s;t, at the rate of half a mile an hour. We continued our northerly cour&s;e, with a breeze from the &s;outh, and fair weather, till ten o'clock in the morning of the
<PB N="28" REF="030274_1316_0FE5788C71D33FC0">
13th, when we again found our&s;elves clo&s;e in with a &s;olid ma&s;s of ice, to which we could per|ceive no limits from the ma&s;t-head. This was an effectual di&s;couragement to all our hopes of penetrating further; which had been greatly rai&s;ed, by our having now advanced almo&s;t ten leagues, through a &s;pace, which, on the 9th, had been found to be occupied by impenetrable ice. Our &s;ituation, at this time, was nearly in the middle of the channel, betwixt the two con|tinents; our latitude was 69&deg; 37&prime;; and the main body of the ice extended from we&s;t-&s;outh-we&s;t to ea&s;t-north-ea&s;t.</P>
<P>As, in that part of the &s;ea where we now were, there was no probability of getting further to the north, Captain Clerke determined to make a final attempt on the coa&s;t of America, for Baffin's Bay, &s;ince we had found it practicable to advance the furthere&s;t on this &s;ide, in the preceding year. We accordingly, during the remainder of the day, worked to the windward, with a fre&s;h breeze from the ea&s;t. We ob&s;erved &s;everal fulmars and arctic gulls, and pa&s;&s;ed two trees, both of which &s;eemed to have lain a loner time in the water. The larger one was, in length, ten or eleven feet, and in circumference, about three, without either the bark or branches.</P>
<P>We proceeded to the ea&s;tward on the 14th, with thick foggy weather. The next day, the wind blowing fre&s;h from the we&s;t, and having,
<PB N="29" REF="030274_1317_0FE5789B6A46F7B0">
in &s;ome mea&s;ure, di&s;per&s;ed the fog, we immedi|ately &s;teered to the north, in order to have a nearer view of the ice; and we were &s;oon clo&s;e in with it. It extended from north-north-we&s;t to north-ea&s;t, and was &s;olid and compact; the ex|terior parts were ragged, and of various heights; the inner &s;urface was even: and, as we &s;uppo&s;ed, from eight to ten feet above the level of the &s;ea. The weather becoming moderate during the re&s;t of the day, we &s;haped our cour&s;e according to the trending of the ice, which, in &s;everal places, formed deep bays.</P>
<P>The wind fre&s;hened in the morning of the 16th, and was accompanied with frequent and thick &s;howers of &s;now. At eight o'clock in the fore|noon, we had a &s;trong gale from the we&s;t-&s;outh-we&s;t, which brought us under double-reefed top-&s;ails; when, the weather in &s;ome degree clearing up, we found our&s;elves, as it were, embayed; the ice having &s;uddenly taken a turn to the &s;outh-ea&s;tward, and encompa&s;&s;ing us, in one compact body, on all &s;ides but the &s;outh. In con&s;equence of this, we hauled our wind to the &s;outhward, being, at that time, in twenty-&s;ix fathoms water, and in the latitude of 70&deg; 8&prime; north; and, as we imagined, at the di&s;tance of about five-and-twenty leagues from the American coa&s;t.</P>
<P>At four in the afternoon, the gale increa&s;ing, we got the top-gallant-yards down upon the deck, &s;urled the mizen top-&s;ail, and clo&s;e-reefed the
<PB N="30" REF="030274_1318_0FE578F35FBE4FF0">
fore and main-top-&s;ails. About eight o'clock, finding that our &s;oundings had decrea&s;ed to twenty-two fathoms, which we con&s;idered as an indication of our near approach to the coa&s;t of America, we tacked and &s;teered to the north-ward. In the night we had boi&s;terous weather, attended with &s;now: but, the next morning, it was clear and moderate; and, at eight o'clock, we got the top-gallant-yards acro&s;s, and bore away, with the wind &s;till at we&s;t-&s;outh-we&s;t. Our latitude, at noon, was 69&deg; 55&prime;, and our lon|gitude, 194&deg; 30&prime;. The wind &s;lackened in the evening, and, about midnight, we had a calm.</P>
<P>A light breeze ari&s;ing from the ea&s;t-north-ea&s;t, at five in the morning of the 18th, we continued our progre&s;s towards the north, with a view of re|gaining the ice as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible. We &s;aw numbers of &s;ea-parrots, and &s;mall ice-birds, and al&s;o many whales; and pa&s;&s;ed &s;everal logs of drift-wood. The latitude, at twelve o'clock, was 70&deg; 26&prime;, and the longitude 194&deg; 54&prime;. Our &s;oundings, at the &s;ame time, were three-and-twenty fathoms; and the ice extended from north to ea&s;t-north-ea&s;t, being about one league di&s;tant.</P>
<P>At one o'clock in the afternoon, ob&s;erving, that we were clo&s;e in with a firm united ma&s;s of ice, &s;tretching from ea&s;t to we&s;t-north-we&s;t, we tacked, and, the wind veering to the we&s;tward, &s;tood to the ea&s;t, along the edge of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t, till eleven in the evening. A very thick fog then coming
<PB N="31" REF="030274_1319_0FE5789EE2AD3668">
on, and the depth of water decrea&s;ing to nineteen fathoms, we hauled our wind to the &s;outhward.</P>
<P>Though we perceived no &s;ea-hor&s;es on the body of ice, yet, on the detached fragments of it, they were &s;een in herds, and in greater numbers than we had ever before ob&s;erved. About nine o'clock in the evening, a white bear &s;wam clo&s;e by the Di&s;covery; it afterwards went towards the ice, on which were likewi&s;e two others.</P>
<P>The weather clearing up at one in the morning of the 19th, we bore away to the north-ea&s;t till two o'clock, when we were again &s;o completely embayed by the ice, that no opening remained, except to the &s;outhward; to which quarter we therefore directed our cour&s;e, and returned through a very &s;mooth water, with favourable weather, by the &s;ame way we had come in. We were unable to penetrate further towards the north than at this time, when our latitude was 70&deg; 33&prime;, which was about five leagues &s;hort of the point to which we had advanced the preceding &s;ummer. We &s;tood to the &s;outh-&s;outh-we&s;t, with light winds from the north-we&s;t, near the edge of the main body of ice, which was &s;ituated on our left hand, extending between us and the American coa&s;t. At noon, our latitude was 70&deg; 11&prime;, and our lon|gitude 196&deg; 15&prime;; and our &s;oundings were &s;ixteen fathoms. We &s;uppo&s;ed, from this circum&s;tance, that the Icy Cape was at the di&s;tance of only &s;even or eight leagues from us: but, though the wea|ther

was, in general, pretty clear, there was, at the &s;ame time, a ha&s;ine&s;s in the horizon &s;o that we could not expect to have an opportunity of &s;eeing the cape.</P>
<P>Two white bears appearing in the water during the afternoon, &s;ome of our people immediately pur&s;ued them in the jolly boat, and were &s;o for|tunate as to kill them both. The larger one, which was, in all probability, the dam of the younger, being &s;hot fir&s;t, the other would not leave it, though it might have e&s;caped with ea&s;e on the ice, while the men were re-loading their mu&s;quets; but continued &s;wimming about, till, after having been &s;everal times fired upon, it was &s;hot dead. The length of the larger one, from the &s;nout to the end of the tail, was &s;even feet two inches; its circumference, near the fore-legs, was four feet ten inches; the height of the &s;houlder was four feet three inches; and the breadth of the &s;ore-paw was ten inches. The weight of its four quarters was four hundred and thirty &s;ix pounds. The four quarters of the &s;malle&s;t weighed two hundred and fifty-&s;ix pounds.</P>
<P>The&s;e animals furni&s;hed us with &s;ome good meals of fre&s;h meat. Their fle&s;h, indeed, had a &s;trong fi&s;hy ta&s;te, but was infinitely &s;uperior to that of the &s;ea-hor&s;e; which, however, our people were again per&s;uaded, with no great dif|ficulty, to prefer to their &s;alted provi&s;ions.</P>

The latitude, at noon, was 69&deg; 33&prime;, and the longitude 194&deg; 53&prime;. Our depth of water, at the &s;ame time, was nineteen fathoms.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>IN con&s;equence of Captain Clerke's determina|tion to relinqui&s;h all attempts on the Ame|rican coa&s;t, and to make his final efforts, in &s;earch of a pa&s;&s;age, on the coa&s;t of the A&s;iatic continent, we &s;teered we&s;t-north-we&s;t&punc; during the afternoon of the 21&s;t of July, through a great quantity of loo&s;e ice. About ten o'clock in the evening, di&s;covering the main body of ice through the fog, right a-head, and very near us, and being
<PB N="36" REF="030274_1324_0FE5790D27C1FE68">
unwilling to &s;tand to the &s;outhward, &s;o long as we could po&s;&s;ibly avoid it; we hauled our wind, which was ea&s;terly, and made &s;ail to the north; but in the &s;pace of an hour afterwards, finding that the weather became clearer, and that we were &s;urrounded by a compact field of ice on all &s;ides, except to the &s;outh-&s;outh-we&s;t, we tacked, and &s;teered in that direction, for the purpo&s;e of getting clear of it. On the 22d at noon, our latitude was 69&deg; 30&prime;, and our longitude 187&deg; 30&prime;. In the afternoon, we again came up with the ice, which extending to the north-we&s;t, and &s;outh-we&s;t, obliged us to proceed to the &s;outhward, in order to weather it.</P>
<P>It may not be improper to remark, that, &s;ince the 8th of July, we had twice traver&s;ed this &s;ea, in lines almo&s;t parallel with the run we had ju&s;t now made; that we were unable in the fir&s;t of tho&s;e traver&s;es, to penetrate &s;o far north, by eight or ten leagues, as in the &s;econd; and that in the la&s;t we had again met with a connected ma&s;s of ice, generally about five leagues to the &s;outhward of its po&s;ition in the preceding run. This makes it evident, that the large compact fields of ice, ob&s;erved by us, were moveable, or dimini&s;hing&punc; but, at the &s;ame time, it does not authori&s;e any expectation of advancing much farther, even in the mo&s;t favourable &s;ea&s;ons.</P>
<P>About &s;even o'clock in the evening, the wea|ther being hazy, and no ice vi&s;ible, we made &s;ail
<PB N="37" REF="030274_1325_0FE579195A086DC0">
to the we&s;tward; but, between eight and nine, the haze di&s;per&s;ing, we found our&s;elves in the mid&s;t of loo&s;e ice, and very near the main body, we therefore &s;tood upon a wind, which was &s;till ea&s;terly, and continued to beat to windward during the night, hoping to weather the loo&s;e pieces, which the wind drove down upon us in &s;uch quantities, that we were in great danger of being blocked up by them.</P>
<P>The next morning, the clear water, in which we &s;teered to and fro, did not exceed a mile and a half, and was le&s;&s;ening every moment. At length, after exerting our mo&s;t &s;trenuous endea|vours to clear the loo&s;e ice, we were under the nece&s;&s;ity of forcing a pa&s;&s;age to the &s;outh, which we accompli&s;hed between &s;even and eight, though not without &s;ubjecting the &s;hip to &s;ome very &s;evere &s;hocks. The Di&s;covery was not &s;o &s;ucce&s;sful, for, about eleven o'clock, when &s;he had almo&s;t got clear out, &s;he became &s;o entangled by &s;everal large pieces, that her progre&s;s was &s;topped, and &s;he immediately dropped to leeward, and fell broad&s;ide foremo&s;t, on the edge of a con&s;iderably body of ice; and there being an open &s;ea to windward, the &s;urf occa&s;ioned her to &s;trike with violence upon it. This ma&s;s, at length, either &s;o far broke, or moved, as to give the crew an opportunity of making another effort to e&s;cape; but it unfortunately happened, that, before the &s;hip gathered way enough to be under
<PB N="38" REF="030274_1326_0FE578E0DAAAFEF0">
command, &s;he fell to leeward a &s;econd time, on another fragment, and the &s;well rendering it un|&s;afe to lie to windward, and finding no pro&s;pect of getting clear, they pu&s;hed into a &s;mall opening, furled their &s;ails, and made the ve&s;&s;el fa&s;t with ice hooks.</P>
<P>We &s;aw them in this dangerous &s;ituation at noon, at the di&s;tance of about three miles from us, in a north-we&s;t direction; a fre&s;h gale from the &s;outh-ea&s;t driving more ice towards the north-we&s;t, and augmenting the body that lay between us. Our latitude at this time was 69&deg; 8&prime;; our longitude 187&deg;; and our &s;oundings were twenty-eight fathoms. To add to the apprehen|&s;ions which began to force them&s;elves on our minds, between four and five in the afternoon, the weather becoming thick and hazy, we lo&s;t &s;ight of the Di&s;covery. However, that we might be in a &s;ituation to afford her every po&s;&s;ible a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance, we &s;tood on clo&s;e by the edge of the ice. About &s;ix o'clock the wind &s;hifting to the north, gave us &s;ome hopes, that the ice might drift away, and relea&s;e her from her danger; and in that ca&s;e, as it was uncertain in what condition &s;he might come out, we continued, every half hour, to fire a gun, with a view of preventing a &s;eparation. Our fears for her &s;afety did not cea&s;e till nine, when we heard her guns fired in an&s;wer to ours; and not long afterwards, being hailed by her, we were informed, that, upon the change of
<PB N="39" REF="030274_1327_0FE578FC21C2B728">
wind, the ice began to &s;eparate; and that her people, &s;etting all the &s;ails, forced a pa&s;&s;age through it. We al&s;o learned, that while they were &s;urrounded by it, they found the &s;hip drift with the main body towards the north-ea&s;t, at the rate of half a mile an hour. We found, that &s;he had rubbed off much of the &s;heathing from her bows, and was become very leaky, from the vio|lent blows &s;he had received when &s;he fell upon the edge of the ice.</P>
<P>On Saturday the 24th, we had fre&s;h breezes from the &s;outh-we&s;t, with hazy weather, and &s;teered to the &s;outh-ea&s;t till eleven o'clock in the forenoon, when our cour&s;e was again ob&s;tructed by a large body of loo&s;e ice, which extended from north-north-ea&s;t to &s;outh-&s;outh-ea&s;t; and to which we could di&s;cover no end. We therefore kept working to windward, and at twelve o'clock our latitude was 68&deg; 53&prime;, and longitude 188&deg;. About four in the afternoon, it became calm, and the boats were hoi&s;ted out in pur&s;uit of the &s;ea-hor&s;es, which appeared in prodigious he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> on each &s;ide of us. Ten of them were killed by our people, which were as many as could be made u&s;e of by us for eating, or for converting into lamp oil. We kept it on with a &s;outh we&s;terly wind, along the edge of the ice, which extended in a direction nearly ea&s;t and we&s;t, till four in the morning of the 25th, when perceiving a clear &s;ea beyond it, to the &s;outh ea&s;tward, we &s;teered that
<PB N="40" REF="030274_1328_0FE578BFCE043DD8">
way, with an intention of forcing through it. We <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">d cleared it by &s;ix, and continued, during the remaining part of the day, to run towards the &s;outh-ea&s;t, with no ice in &s;ight.</P>
<P>At noon, our latitude was 68&deg; 38&prime;, our longi|tude 189&deg; 9&prime;, and our &s;oundings thirty fathoms. We tacked at midnight, and &s;tood to the we&s;t, with a fre&s;h &s;outherly gale; and the next morn|ing, at ten, the ice again made its appearance, extending from north-we&s;t to &s;outh. It was loo&s;e, and drifted by the force of the wind towards the north. At twelve, our latitude was 68&deg;, lon|gitude 88&deg; 10&prime;, and our depth of water was twenty-eight fathoms. For the remainder of the day, and till noon on the 27th, we &s;tood backwards and forwards, to clear our&s;elves of different pieces of ice. The latitude at noon was 67&deg; 47&prime;, and the longitude 181&deg;.</P>
<P>At two in the afternoon, we had &s;ight of the continent to the &s;outh by ea&s;t; and at four, hav|ing run, &s;ince noon, to the &s;outh-we&s;t, we were encompa&s;&s;ed by loo&s;e ma&s;&s;es of ice, with the main body of it in view, &s;tretching in the direction of north by we&s;t, and &s;outh by ea&s;t, as far as the eye could reach, beyond which we de&s;cried the A&s;ia|tic coa&s;t, bearing &s;outh, and &s;outh by ea&s;t.</P>
<P>It being now nece&s;&s;ary to come to &s;ome deter|mination re&s;pecting the cour&s;e we were next to &s;teer, Captain Clerke di&s;patched a boat, with the carpenters, on board the Di&s;covery, to make in|quiry
<PB N="41" REF="030274_1329_0FE578B573C03EC8">
into the particulars of the damage &s;he had lately received. They returned, in the evening, with the report of Captain Gore, and of the car|penters of both ve&s;&s;els, that the damages &s;u&s;|tained were &s;uch as would require three weeks to repair; and that it would be requi&s;ite, for that purpo&s;e, to make the be&s;t of their way to &s;ome port.</P>
<P>Thus, finding our farther progre&s;s to the north, as well as our nearer approach to either continent, ob&s;tructed by immence bodies of ice, we con&s;i|dered it as not only injurious to the &s;ervice, by endangering the &s;afety of the &s;hips, but likewi&s;e fruitle&s;s with re&s;pect to the de&s;ign of our voyage to make any farther attempts for the di&s;covery of a pa&s;&s;age. This, therefore, added to Captain Gore's repre&s;entations, determined Captain Clerke to lo&s;e no more time in what he concluded to be an unattainable object, but to proceed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o the bay of Awat&s;ka, to repair our damages there, and, before the winter &s;hould &s;et in, to take a &s;urvey of the coa&s;t of Japan.</P>
<P>Great was the joy that appeared on the coun|tenance of every individual, as &s;oon as Captain Clerke's re&s;olutions were made known. We were all completely weary of a navigation full of dan|ger, and in which the greate&s;t per&s;everance had not been rewarded with the &s;malle&s;t pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s. We therefore turned our faces towards home, after an ab&s;ence of three years, with ex|treme
<PB N="42" REF="030274_1330_0FE578AA85983C58">
delight and &s;atisfaction, notwith&s;tanding the very long voyage we had &s;till to make.</P>
<P>We worked to windward on the 28th, with a fre&s;h breeze from the &s;outh-ea&s;t, being &s;till in &s;ight of the coa&s;t of A&s;ia. At four in the morn|ing, Cape Serdze Kamen bore &s;outh-&s;outh-we&s;t, at the di&s;tance of &s;ix or &s;even leagues. We ob|&s;erved, in different places, upon the &s;ummits of the hills, which ri&s;e inland on each &s;ide of this Cape, protuberances of a con&s;iderable height, which had the appearance of pillows of &s;tone, or great rocks.</P>
<P>The next day, the wind being &s;till unfavour|able, we made but &s;low progre&s;s to the &s;outh|ward. About midnight, we had foggy weather, attended with a breeze from the north-north-we&s;t, with which we &s;teered to the &s;outh-&s;outh-ea&s;t, through the &s;traits, and had no land in our view till &s;even in the evening of the 30th, when the fog di&s;per&s;ing, we &s;aw Cape Prince of Wales, bearing &s;outh by ea&s;t, at the di&s;tance of about &s;ix leagues; and the i&s;land of St. Diornede &s;outh-we&s;t by we&s;t. We now &s;tood to the we&s;t, and at eight made the Ea&s;t Cape, which at midnight, was four leagues di&s;tant, bearing we&s;t by north.</P>
<P>During the night we &s;teered to the &s;outh-&s;outh-we&s;t, with a fre&s;h breeze from the we&s;t north-we&s;t, and on the 31&s;t, at four in the morning, the Ea&s;t Cape bore north-north-ea&s;t and the north-ea&s;t part of the Bay of St. Lawrence,
<PB N="43" REF="030274_1331_0FE578624721C288">
(where our &s;hips anchored the preceding year) we&s;t by &s;outh, its di&s;tance being twelve miles. As we could not have worked up to windward, without a greater con&s;umption of time, than the object &s;eemed to de&s;erve, we ran acro&s;s the bay regretting the lo&s;s of this opportunity of paying another vi&s;it to the Tu&s;chut&s;ki. At twelve o'clock our latitude was 65&deg; 6&prime;, and longitude 189&deg;. The &s;outh point of the bay of St. Lawrence was &s;even or eight leagues di&s;tant, bearing north by we&s;t one quarter we&s;t.</P>
<P>Having now pa&s;&s;ed Beering's Straits, and finally quitted the north-ea&s;t coa&s;t of A&s;ia, it may not, perhaps, be improper, on this occa&s;ion, to &s;tate our rea&s;ons for adopting two general con|clu&s;ions relative to its extent, in oppo&s;ition to the &s;entiments of Mr. Muller. The fir&s;t is, that the promontory called Ea&s;t Cape is actually the mo&s;t ea&s;terly point of that quarter of the globe; or, in other words, that no part of that continent extends in longitude beyond 190&deg; 22&prime; ea&s;t. The &s;econd is, that the latitude of the north ea&s;tern|mo&s;t extreme is &s;omewhat to the &s;outhward of 70&deg; north. With regard to the former, if &s;uch land really exi&s;ts, it mu&s;t certainly be to the north of the 69th degree of latitude, where the di&s;co|veries made in our pre&s;ent voyage terminate. We &s;hall therefore, in the fir&s;t place, endeavour to inve&s;tigate the probable direction of the coa&s;t be|yond this point.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="030274_1332_0FE57928441D5458">Ru&s;&s;ia being the only nation, that has hitherto navigated this part of the ocean, all our infor|mation re&s;pecting the po&s;ition of the coa&s;t to the northward of Cape North, is derived from the journals and charts of the per&s;ons who have been engaged, at different times, in determining the bounds of that exten&s;ive empire; and the&s;e are, in general, &s;o confined, contradictory, and im|perfect, that we cannot ea&s;ily form a di&s;tinct idea of their pretended, much le&s;s collect the parti|culars of their real di&s;coveries. On this account, the extent and figure of the penin&s;ula, inhabited by the T&s;chut&s;ki, &s;till remains a point, on which the Ru&s;&s;ian geographers are greatly divided in their opinions. Mr. Muller, in the map which he publi&s;hed in 1754 &s;uppo&s;es that this country extends towards the north-ea&s;t, as far as the lati|tude of 75&deg;, and the longitude of 190&deg; ea&s;t of Greenwich; and that it ends, in a round cape, which he denominates T&s;chukot&s;koi No&s;s. To the &s;outh of this cape, the coa&s;t, as he imagines, forms a bay to the we&s;t, bounded in the latitude of 67&deg; 18&prime; by Serdze Kamen, the mo&s;t northerly point ob&s;erved by Beering in his expedition in 1728. The map publi&s;hed in 1776 by the aca|demy of St. Peter&s;burg, gives a new form to the whole penin&s;ula, placing its north-ea&s;ternmo&s;t extreme in the latitude 73&deg;, longitude 178&deg; 30&prime;, and the mo&s;t ea&s;terly point in latitude 65&deg; 30&prime;, longitude 189&deg; 30&prime;. All the other maps we have
<PB N="45" REF="030274_1333_0FE5792307A33B10">
&s;een, both manu&s;cript and printed, vary between the&s;e two, apparently more according to the fancy and conjectures of the compiler, than on any grounds of more accurate intelligence. The only particular in which there is a general coincidence, with very little variation, is the po&s;ition of the Ea&s;t Cape in the latitude of 66&deg;. The form of the coa&s;t, both to the north and &s;outh or the Ea&s;t Cape, in the map of the academy is extremely erroneous, and may be entirely di&s;regarded. In Mr. Muller's map, the coa&s;t towards the north has &s;ome degree of re&s;emblance to our &s;urvey, as far as the latter extends, except that he does not make it trend &s;ufficiently to the we&s;t, but makes it recede only about 5&deg; of longitude, between the latitude of 66&deg; and 69&deg;; whereas it actually re|cedes near ten. Between the latitude of 69&deg; and 74&deg;, the coa&s;t, according to him, bends round to the north and north-ea&s;t, and forms a large pro|montory. On what authority he has thus repre|&s;ented the coa&s;t, is next to be examined.</P>
<P>The ingenious Mr. Coxe, who&s;e accurate re|&s;earches in this &s;ubject, give great weight to his &s;entiments, is of opinion, that the extremity of the No&s;s in que&s;tion, was never pa&s;&s;ed except by De&s;hneff and his party, who &s;ailed in the year 1648, from the river Kovyma, and are imagined to have got round it into the Anadyr.

Ru&s;&s;ian di&s;coveries, comprehends no geographi|cal delineations of the coa&s;t along which they &s;ail|ed, our conjectures re&s;pecting its po&s;ition mu&s;t be derived from incidental circum&s;tances; and from the&s;e it evidently appears, that the T&s;chu|kot&s;koi No&s;s of De&s;hneff, is, in reality, the pro|montory named by Captain Cook, the Ea&s;t Cape. Speaking of the No&s;s, he &s;ays, that a per&s;on may &s;ail from the i&s;thmus to the Anadyr, with a favour|able wind, in three days, and three nights. This perfectly agrees with the &s;ituation of the Ea&s;t Cape, which is about one hundred and twenty leagues from the mouth of the river Anadyr; and there being no other i&s;thmus to the north between that and the latitude of 69&deg;, it &s;eems evident, that, by this de&s;cription he certainly means either the Cape in que&s;tion, or &s;ome other &s;ituated to the &s;outh of it. He &s;ays, in another place, that, oppo&s;ite to the i&s;thmus, there are two i&s;lands in the &s;ea, upon which were ob&s;erved &s;ome of the T&s;chut&s;ki nation, in who&s;e lips pieces of the teeth of the &s;ea-hor&s;es were fixed. This exactly coincides with the two i&s;lands that lie to the &s;outh-ea&s;t of the Ea&s;t Cape. We ob&s;erved, indeed, no inhabi|tants upon them; but it is by no means impro|bable, that a party of Americans from the op|po&s;ite continent, whom this de&s;cription &s;uits, might have accidentally been there at that time, and he might ea&s;ily mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">take them for a tribe of the T&s;chut&s;ki.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="030274_1335_0FE579250C2E7820">The&s;e two circum&s;tances &s;eem to us to be con|clu&s;ive on the point of the T&s;chukot&s;koi No&s;s, though there are others of a more dubious nature from the &s;ame authority, and which now remain to be inve&s;tigated. De&s;hneff, in another account, &s;ays, that in going from the Kovyma to the Ana|dyr, a great promontory which projects very far into the &s;ea, mu&s;t be doubled; and that this pro|montory extends between north and north-ea&s;t. It was, perhaps, from the&s;e expre&s;&s;ions, that Muller was induced to repre&s;ent the country of the T&s;chut&s;ki, in the form we find in his map; but, if he had been acquainted with the po&s;ition of the Ea&s;t Cape, as determined by Captain Cook, and the &s;triking agreement between that and the promontory or i&s;thmus (for it mu&s;t be remarked, that De&s;hneff &s;till appears to be &s;peak|ing of the &s;ame thing), in the circum&s;tances above-mentioned, we are confident that he would not have thought tho&s;e expre&s;&s;ions of &s;ufficient weight to authori&s;e his extending the north-ea&s;t|ern extreme of A&s;ia, either &s;o far to the north or to the ea&s;t. For the&s;e words of De&s;hneff may be reconciled with the opinion we have adopted, if we &s;uppo&s;e that navigator to have taken the&s;e bearings from the &s;mall bight lying to the we&s;t of the cape.</P>
<P>The next authority, on which Muller has pro|ceeded, &s;eems to have been the depo&s;ition of the Co&s;&s;ac Popoff, taken at the Anadir&s;koi <HI>o&s;trog,</HI> in
<PB N="48" REF="030274_1336_0FE5787F40699358">
1711. This Co&s;&s;ac was &s;ent by land, in compa|ny with &s;everal others, to demand tribute from the independent T&s;chut&s;ki tribes, who inhabited the parts about the No&s;s. The fir&s;t circum&s;tance, in the narative of this journey, that can tend to lead to the &s;ituation of T&s;chukot&s;koi No&s;s, is its di&s;tance from Anadir&s;k; and this is repre&s;ented as a journey of ten weeks, with loaded rein-deer; for which rea&s;on, it is added, their day's jour|ney was very incon&s;iderable. We cannot, in|deed, conclude much from &s;o vague an account, but as the di&s;tance between the Ea&s;t Cape and the <HI>o&s;trog</HI> exceeds two hundred leagues in a direct line, and con&s;equently may be &s;uppo&s;ed to allow twelve or fourteen miles a day, its &s;ituation is not incompatible with Popoff's calculation.</P>
<P>Another circum&s;tance &s;tated in this depo&s;ition is, that their rout lay at the foot of a rock named Matkol, &s;ituate at the bottom of a &s;pacious gulph. This gulf Muller conjectures to be the bay he had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">aid down between the latitudes of 66&deg; and 72&deg; and he accordingly places the rock Matkol in the center of it; but it appears to be more probable, that it might be a part of the Gulf of Anadyr, which they would doubtle&s;s touch upon in their journey from the o&s;trog to the Ea&s;t Cap.</P>
<P>What &s;eems, however, to put this point beyond all di&s;pute, and to prove that the Cape which Popoff vi&s;ited cannot be the northward of the latitude of 69&deg;, is that part of his depo&s;ition,
<PB N="49" REF="030274_1337_0FE57934B8570CC8">
which relates to an i&s;land lying off the No&s;s, from whence the oppo&s;ite continent might be di&s;|cerned. For, as the two continents, in the lati|tude of 69&deg;, diverge &s;o far as to be upwards of one hundred leagues di&s;tant, it is certainly very improbable, that the coa&s;t of A&s;ia &s;hould again trend in &s;uch a manner to the ea&s;t, as to come almo&s;t within &s;ight of the American coa&s;t.</P>
<P>Should the&s;e arguments be thought conclu&s;ive again&s;t the form and extent of the penin&s;ula of the T&s;chut&s;ki, as repre&s;ented by Mr. Muller, it will follow, that the Ea&s;t Cape is the T&s;chukot|&s;koi No&s;s of the earlier Ru&s;&s;ian navigators<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">We mention the earlier Ru&s;&s;ian navigators, becau&s;e Beering, and, after him, the late Ru&s;&s;ian geographers, have affixed this appellation to the &s;outh-ea&s;t cape of the penin&s;ula of the T&s;chut&s;ki, which was former|ly di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of the Anadir&s;koi No&s;s.</NOTE>; and, con&s;equently, that the unde&s;cribed coa&s;t, extend|ing from the latitude of 69&deg; to the mouth of the Kovyma, mu&s;t con&s;equently trend more or le&s;s towards the we&s;t. As an additional proof of this, we may ob&s;erve, that T&s;chukot&s;koi No&s;s is con&s;tantly laid down as dividing the &s;ea of Kovyma from that of Anadyr, which (we are of opinion) could not po&s;&s;ibly be, if any large cape had projected to the north-ea&s;t in the more ad|vanced latitudes.</P>
<P>Another que&s;tion ari&s;ing on this point, is, to what degree of northern latitude this coa&s;t ex|tends,
<PB N="50" REF="030274_1338_0FE57880EAADA8C0">
before it inclines more immediately to the we&s;t. If the po&s;ition of the mouth of the Ko|vyma, both with regard to its latitude and lon|gitude, were accurately a&s;certained, it might per|haps be ea&s;y to form a plau&s;ible conjecture upon this head. Captain Cook was always &s;trongly induced to believe, that the northern coa&s;t of A&s;ia, from the Indigirka ea&s;tward, has hitherto been u&s;ually laid down above two degrees to the northward of its true &s;ituation; and he has therefore, on the authority of a map that was in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and on the intelligence which he received at Oonala&s;hka, placed the mouth of the Kovyma, in his chart of the north-ea&s;t coa&s;t of A&s;ia, and the north-we&s;t coa&s;t of America, in the latitude of 68&deg;. Should the Captain be right in this conjecture, it is probable, for the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ea&s;ons which we have already &s;tated, that the coa&s;t of A&s;ia does not, in any part, exceed 70&deg; before it trends towards the we&s;t, and con&s;equently, that we were within one degree of its north-ea&s;tern ex|tremity. For if the continent be imagined to extend any where to the north of Shelat&s;koi No&s;s it can &s;carcely be &s;uppo&s;ed that &s;uch an intere&s;t|ing circum&s;tance would have been omitted by the Ru&s;&s;ian Navigators, who mention no remark|able promontory between the Anadyr and the Kovyma except the Ea&s;t Cape. Another par|ticular, which De&s;hneff relates, may, perhaps, be deemed a farther confirmation of this opinion,
<PB N="51" REF="030274_1339_0FE578A711600B38">
namely, that he met with no ob&s;truction from ice in &s;ailing round the north-ea&s;tern extremity of A&s;ia; though he adds that this &s;ea is not at all times &s;o free from it; as indeed evidently ap|pears from his not &s;ucceeding in his fir&s;t expe|dition, and, &s;ince that, from the failure of Sha|lauroff, as well as from the interruptions and im|pediments we met with, in two &s;ucce&s;&s;ive years, in our pre&s;ent voyage.</P>
<P>That part of the continent, which is between Cape North, and the mouth of the Kovyma, is one hundred and twenty-five leagues in longitu|dinal extent. About a third of this di&s;tance from the Kovyma ea&s;tward, was explored in 1723, by Fedot Amo&s;&s;off, a <HI>Sinbojar&s;koi</HI> of Jakutz, who in|formed Mr. Muller, that its direction was ea&s;ter|ly. It has &s;ince that time been &s;urveyed, with &s;ome degree of accuracy, by Shalauroff, who&s;e chart makes it trend to the north-ea&s;t by ea&s;t, as far as Shelat&s;koi No&s;s, which he places at the di&s;tance of about forty-three leagues to the ea&s;t of the Kovyma. The &s;pace, therefore, between the No&s;s and Cape North, upwards of eighty leagues, is the only part of the Ru&s;&s;ian dominions now remaining una&s;certained.</P>
<P>If the Kovyma, however, be erroneou&s;ly laid down, in point of longitude as well as latitude, (a &s;uppo&s;ition by no means improbable) the ex|tent of the unexplored coa&s;t will dimini&s;h in pro|portion. The rea&s;ons which incline us to ima|gine,
<PB N="52" REF="030274_1340_0FE578E304B17250">
that in the Ru&s;&s;ian charts, the mouth of the river is placed con&s;iderably too far to the we&s;t, are the following: fir&s;t, becau&s;e the ac|counts that have been given of the navigation of the Frozen Ocean, from that river, round the North-Ea&s;tern extreme of A&s;ia, to the gulf of Anadyr, do not agree with the &s;uppo&s;ed di&s;tance between tho&s;e places; &s;econdly, becau&s;e the di&s;|tance from the Anadyr to the Kovyma, over land, is repre&s;ented by former Ru&s;&s;ian travellers as a journey of no very great length, and ea&s;ily performed: thirdly, becau&s;e the coa&s;t from the Shelat&s;koi No&s;s of Shalauroff appears to trend directly &s;outh-ea&s;t towards the Ea&s;t Cape. If this be really the ca&s;e, it may be inferred, that as we were, in all probability, not more than one degree to the &s;outhward of Shelat&s;koi No&s;s, only &s;ixty miles of the coa&s;t of A&s;ia are una&s;certained.</P>
<P>It is highly probable, that a north<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">we&s;t pa&s;|&s;age from the Atlantic into the Pacific Ocean does not exi&s;t to the &s;outhward of the fifty-&s;ixth degree of latitude. If, therefore, a pa&s;&s;age really exi&s;ts, it mu&s;t certainly be either through Baffin's-bay, or by the north of Greenland, in the we&s;tern hemi&s;phere; or in the ea&s;tern, through the Frozen Sea, to the north of Siberia; and on whichever &s;ide it is &s;ituated, the navigator mu&s;t pa&s;s through the &s;traits di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of Beering's Straits. The impracticability of penetrating into the Atlantic Ocean on either &s;ide, through the&s;e
<PB N="53" REF="030274_1341_0FE578FDE455D1A0">
&s;traits, is therefore all that now remains to be offered to the reader's con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>The &s;ea to the northward of Beering's Straits, was found by us to be more free from ice in Augu&s;t than in July, and perhaps in &s;ome part of September it may be &s;till more clear of it. But, after the autumnal equinox, the length of the days dimini&s;hes &s;o fa&s;t, that no farther thaw can be expected; and we cannot rea&s;onably at|tribute &s;o great an effect to the warm weather in the la&s;t fortnight in the month of September, as to imagine it capable of di&s;per&s;ing the ice, from the mo&s;t northern parts of the coa&s;t of America. Admitting this, however, to be po&s;&s;ible, it mu&s;t at lea&s;t be allowed, that it would be highly ab|&s;urd to attempt to avoid the Icy Cape by running to the known parts of Baffin's Bay, (a di&s;tance of about twelve hundred and &s;ixty miles) in &s;o &s;hort a &s;pace of time as that pa&s;&s;age can be &s;uppo&s;ed to remain open.</P>
<P>There appears, on the &s;ide of A&s;ia, &s;till le&s;s probability of &s;ucce&s;s, not only from what came to our own knowledge, relative to the &s;tate of the &s;ea to the &s;outhward of Cape North, but likewi&s;e from what we have gathered from the experience of the Lieutenants under the direction of Beering, and the journal of Shalauroff, re&s;pect|ing that on the north of Siberia.</P>
<P>The po&s;&s;ibility of &s;ailing round the north-ea&s;tern extremity of A&s;ia, is undoubtedly proved
<PB N="54" REF="030274_1342_0FE57900F3A8BB40">
by the voyage of De&s;hneff, if its truth be ad|mitted; but when we reflect, that, &s;ince the time of that navigator, near a century and a half has elap&s;ed, during which, in an age of curio&s;ity and enterprize, no per&s;on has yet been able to follow him, we can entertain no very &s;anguine expecta|tions of the public benefits which can be derived from it. But even on the &s;uppo&s;ition, that, in &s;ome remarkably favourable &s;ea&s;on, a ve&s;&s;el might find a clear pa&s;&s;age round the coa&s;t of Siberia, and arrive in &s;afety at the mouth of the Lena, &s;till there remains the Cape of Taimura, extending to the &s;eventy-eighth degree of latitude, which no navigator has hitherto had the good fortune to double.</P>
<P>Some, however, contend, that there are &s;trong rea&s;ons for believing, that the nearer approach we make to the Pole, the &s;ea is more clear of ice; and that all the ice we ob&s;erved in the lower lati|tudes, had originally been formed in the great rivers of Siberia and America, from the breaking up of which the intermediate &s;ea had been filled. But even if that &s;uppo&s;ition be true, it is no le&s;s cer|tain that there can be no acce&s;s to tho&s;e open &s;eas, unle&s;s this prodigious ma&s;s of ice is &s;o far di&s;&s;olved in the &s;ummer, as to admit of a &s;hip's making its way through it. If this be the real fact, we made choice of an improper time of the year for attempting to di&s;cover this pa&s;&s;age, which &s;hould have been explored in the months of
<PB N="55" REF="030274_1343_0FE57893AE33DD98">
April and May, before the rivers were broken up. But &s;everal rea&s;ons may be alledged again&s;t &s;uch a &s;uppo&s;ition. Our experience at Petropaulow&s;ka, gave us an opportunity of judging what might be expected farther northward; and upon that ground, we had &s;ome rea&s;on to entertain a doubt, whether the two continents might not, during the winter, be even joined by the ice: and this coincided with the accounts we heard in Kamt|&s;chat&s;ka, that, on the coa&s;t of Siberia, the inha|bitants, in the winter, go out from the &s;hore, upon the ice, to di&s;tances that exceed the breath of the &s;ea, in &s;ome parts, from one continent to the other.</P>
<P>The following remarkable particular is men|tioned in the depo&s;ition above referred to. Speak|ing of the land &s;een from the T&s;chut&s;ki No&s;s, it is &s;aid, that, during the &s;ummer, they &s;ail in one day to the land in <HI>baidares,</HI> a kind of ve&s;&s;el formed of whale-bone, and covered with the &s;kins of &s;eals; and, in the winter, as they go &s;wift with rein-deer, the journey may al&s;o be performed in a day. A &s;atisfactory proof, that the two coun|tries were generally connected by the ice.</P>
<P>Muller's account of one of the expeditions undertaken for the purpo&s;e of di&s;covering a &s;up|po&s;ed i&s;land in the Frozen Ocean, is &s;till more remarkable. His narrative is to the following purport. In 1714, a new expedition was pre|pared from Jakntzk, under the conduct of Alexei
<PB N="56" REF="030274_1344_0FE578A8CB635FF0">
Markoff, who was to &s;et &s;ail from the mouth of the Jana; and if the Schitiki were not well adapted for &s;ea voyages, he was to build, at a convenient place, proper ve&s;&s;els for pro&s;ecuting the di&s;coveries without any great ri&s;que. Upon his arrival at U&s;t-jan&s;koe Simovie, the port where he was to embark, he di&s;patched an account, dated the 2d of February, 1515, to the Chancery of Jakutzka, intimating that it was impracticable to navigate the &s;ea, as it was con&s;tantly frozen both in winter and &s;ummer; and that, con&s;e|quently, the expedition could only be pro&s;ecuted with &s;ledges drawn by dogs. He accordingly &s;et out in this manner, accompanied with nine per|&s;ons, the 10th of March, in the &s;ame year, and returned to U&s;t-jan&s;koe Simovie on the 3d of the &s;ucceeding month. The account of his journey is as follows; that, for the &s;pace of &s;even days, he travelled with as much expedition as his dogs could draw, (which, in good tracks, and favourable weather, is from eighty to a hundred wer&s;ts in a day) directly to the northward, upon the ice, without ob&s;erving any i&s;land: that he was prevented from proceeding farther, by the ice, which ro&s;e like mountains in that part of the &s;ea: that he had a&s;cended &s;ome of the hills of ice, whence he could &s;ee to a great di&s;tance around him, but could di&s;cern no land: and that, at length, provi&s;ions for his dogs being deficient,
<PB N="57" REF="030274_1345_0FE578CC6C6CE8D8">
many of them died, which reduced him to the nece&s;&s;ity of returning.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the above-mentioned arguments, which proceed upon an admi&s;&s;ion of the hypothe&s;is, that the ice in this ocean comes from the rivers, others may be adduced, which afford good rea&s;on for &s;u&s;pecting the truth of the hypothe&s;is it&s;elf. Captain Cook, who&s;e opinion, with regard to the formation of ice, had originally coincided with that of the theori&s;ts we are now endeavour|ing to confute, found &s;ufficient grounds, in the pre&s;ent voyage, for changing his &s;entiments. We ob&s;erved, that the coa&s;ts of both continents were low, that the depth of water gradually decrea&s;ed towards them, and that a &s;triking re&s;emblance prevailed between the two; from which circum|&s;tances, as well as from the de&s;cription given by Mr. Hearne of the copper-mine river, we have room for conjecturing, that, whatever rivers may di&s;charge them&s;elves into the Frozen Ocean, from the continent of America are of a &s;imilar nature with tho&s;e on the A&s;iatic &s;ide; which are &s;aid to be &s;o &s;hallow at their entrance, as to admit only ve&s;&s;els of incon&s;iderable magnitude; whereas, the ice &s;een by us, ri&s;es above the level of the &s;ea, to a height that equals the depth of tho&s;e rivers; &s;o that its entire altitude mu&s;t be, at lea&s;t, ten times greater.</P>
<P>Another circum&s;tance will naturally offer it&s;elf, in this place, to our con&s;ideration, which &s;eems
<PB N="58" REF="030274_1346_0FE578FF6F0D93F8">
to be very incompatible with the opinion of tho&s;e who &s;uppo&s;e that land is nece&s;&s;ary for the forma|tion of ice; we mean, the different &s;tate of the &s;ea about Spit&s;bergen, and of that which is to the northward of Beering's Straits. It is incumbent on tho&s;e philo&s;ophers to explain how it happens, that in the former quarter, and in the neighbour|hood of much known land, navigators annually penetrate to near eighty degrees of northern lati|tude; whereas, on the other &s;ide, no voyager has been able, with his utmo&s;t efforts, to proceed beyond the &s;eventy-fir&s;t degree; where, more|over, the continents diverge nearly in the direc|tion of ea&s;t and we&s;t, and where there is no land yet known to exi&s;t in the vicinity of the pole. For the farther &s;atisfaction of our readers on this &s;ubject, we refer them to Dr. For&s;ter's " Ob&s;erva|tions round the World," where they will find the que&s;tion, of the formation of the ice, di&s;cu&s;&s;ed in a full and &s;atisfactory manner, and the proba|bility of open polar &s;eas, di&s;proved by many for|cible arguments.</P>
<P>To the&s;e remarks, we &s;hall &s;ubjoin a compara|tive view of the progre&s;s made by us to the north|ward, at the two different &s;ea&s;ons in which we were occupied in that pur&s;uit; together with &s;ome general ob&s;ervations re&s;pecting the &s;ea, and the coa&s;ts of the two continents, which lie to the north of Beering's Straits.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="030274_1347_0FE578B8E82701C8">In the year 1778, we did not di&s;cover the ice, till we advanced to the latitude of 70&deg;, on the 17th of Augu&s;t; and we then found it in com|pact bodies, which extend as far as the eye could di&s;cern, and of which the whole, or a part was moveable; &s;ince, by its drifting down upon our &s;hips, we were almo&s;t hemmed in between that and the land. After we had experienced, both how fruitle&s;s and dangerous it would be, to attempt to penetrate farther to the northward, between the land and the ice, we &s;tood over to|wards the &s;ide of A&s;ia, between the latitudes of 69&deg; and 70&deg;; after encountering in this tract very large fields of ice, and through the fogs, and thickne&s;s of the weather, prevented us from en|tirely tracing a connected line of it acro&s;s, yet we were certain of meeting with it before it reached the latitude of 70&deg;, whenever we made any at|tempts to &s;tand to the north.</P>
<P>On the 26th of Augu&s;t, in the latitude of 69&deg; &frac34; and the longitude of 184&deg;, we were ob&s;tructed by it in &s;uch quantities, that we could not pa&s;s either to the north or we&s;t; and were under the nece&s;&s;ity of running along the edge of it to the &s;outh-&s;outh-we&s;t, till we perceived land which proved to be the A&s;iatic coa&s;t. With the &s;ea&s;on thus far advanced, the weather &s;etting in with &s;now and &s;leet, and other indications of the approach of winter, we relinqui&s;hed our enterprize for that time.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="030274_1348_0FE579162D0730F0">In our &s;econd attempt, we did little more than confirm the remarks made by us in the fir&s;t; for we never had an opportunity of approaching the continent of A&s;ia higher than 67&deg; of latitude, nor that of America in any parts, except a few leagues between the latitude of 68&deg; and 68&deg; 20&prime;, that we had not &s;een in the preceding year. We now met with ob&s;truction from ice 3&deg; over; and our efforts to make farther progre&s;s to the northward, were chiefly confined to the middle &s;pace between the two coa&s;ts. We penetrated near 3&deg; farther on the &s;ide of America, than that of A&s;ia, com|ing up with the ice both years &s;ooner, and in more con&s;iderable quantities, on the latter coa&s;t. As we advanced in our northerly cour&s;e, we found the ice more &s;olid and compact; however, as in our different traver&s;es from one &s;ide to the other, we pa&s;&s;ed over &s;paces which had before been covered with it, we imagined, that the greate&s;t part of what we &s;aw was moveable. Its height, on a medium, we e&s;timated at eight or ten feet, and that of the highe&s;t at &s;ixteen or eighteen. We again examined the currents twice, and found that they were unequal, though they never ex|ceeded one mile an hour. We likewi&s;e found the currents to &s;et different ways, but more from the &s;outh-we&s;t than any other quarter; yet, what|ever their direction might be, their effect was &s;o incon&s;iderable, that on conclu&s;ions, with re&s;pect

to the exi&s;tence of any pa&s;&s;age towards the north, could po&s;&s;ibly be drawn from them.</P>
<P>We found July infinitely colder than Augu&s;t. The thermometer, in the fir&s;t of the&s;e months, was once at 28&deg;, and very frequently at 30&deg;; whereas, during the la&s;t year, it was very un|common in Augu&s;t, to have it &s;o low as the freez|ing point. In both &s;ea&s;ons, we experienced &s;ome high winds, all of which blew from the &s;outh-we&s;t. Whenever the wind was moderate from any quarter, we were &s;ubject to fogs; but they were ob&s;erved to attend &s;outherly winds more con&s;tantly than others.</P>
<P>The &s;traits, between the American and A&s;iatic continents, at their neare&s;t approach, in the lati|tude of 66&deg;, were a&s;certained by us to be thirteen leagues, beyond which they diverge to north-ea&s;t by ea&s;t, and we&s;t-north-we&s;t; and in the latitude of 69&deg;, their di&s;tance from each other is about three hundred miles. In the a&s;pect of the two coun|tries to the north of the &s;traits, a great re&s;em|blance is ob&s;ervable. Both of them are de&s;titute of wood. The &s;hores are low, with mountains further inland, ri&s;ing to a great height. The &s;oundings, in the mid-way between them, were twenty-nine and thirty fathoms, gradually de|crea&s;ing as we approached either continent; with this difference, however, that the water was &s;ome|what &s;hallower on the coa&s;t of America than on that of A&s;ia, at an equal di&s;tance from land. The
<PB N="62" REF="030274_1350_0FE578F1AD16ADC8">
bottom, towards the middle, was a &s;oft &s;limy mud; and near either &s;hore, it was a browni&s;h &s;and, intermixed with a few &s;hells, and &s;mall frag|ments of bones. We found but little tide or cur|rent, and that little came from the we&s;t.</P>
<P>We will now re&s;ume the narrative of our voy|age, which was continued till the 31&s;t of July; on which day we had proceeded, at noon, eigh|teen leagues to the &s;outhward of the ea&s;t cape. We had light airs from the &s;outh-we&s;t till the fir&s;t of Augu&s;t, at noon, when our latitude was 64&deg; 23&prime;, and our longitude 189&deg; 15&prime;; the A&s;iatic coa&s;t extending from north-we&s;t by we&s;t, to we&s;t half &s;outh, at the di&s;tance of about twelve leagues, and the land to the ea&s;tward of St. Lawrence bearing &s;outh half we&s;t.</P>
<P>On Monday the &s;econd, the weather being clear, we perceived the &s;ame land at noon, ex|tending from we&s;t-&s;outh-we&s;t half we&s;t to &s;outh-ea&s;t, and forming many elevated hummocks, which bore the appearance of &s;eparate i&s;lands. The latitude, at this time, was 64&deg; 3&prime;, the longi|tude 189&deg; 28&prime;, and our &s;oundings were &s;eventeen fathoms. We were not near enough to this land to a&s;certain whether it was a group of i&s;lands, or only a &s;ingle one. We had pa&s;&s;ed its mo&s;t we&s;terly point in the evening of the third of July, which we then &s;uppo&s;ed to be the i&s;le of St. Lawrence; the ea&s;ternmo&s;t we &s;ailed clo&s;e by in September the preceding year, and this we deno|minated
<PB N="63" REF="030274_1351_0FE578E6E35E2F18">
Clerke's I&s;land; and found it compo&s;ed of a number of lofty cliffs, connected by very low land. Though the&s;e cliffs, the la&s;t year, were mi&s;taken by us for &s;eparate i&s;lands, till we made a very near approach to the &s;hore, we are &s;till inclined to conjecture, that the i&s;le of St. Lawrence is di&s;tinct from Clerke's I&s;land, as there appeared betwixt them a con&s;iderable &s;pace, where we did not ob&s;erve the lea&s;t appearance of ri&s;ing ground. In the afternoon, we likewi&s;e &s;aw what had the appearance of a &s;mall i&s;land, to the north-ea&s;t of the land that we had &s;een at noon, and which, from the thickne&s;s of the wea|ther, we only had &s;ight of once. We &s;uppo&s;ed its di&s;tance to be nineteen leagues from the i&s;land of St. Lawrence, in the direction of north-ea&s;t by ea&s;t half ea&s;t.</P>
<P>We had light variable winds on the 3d, and &s;teered round the north-we&s;t point of the i&s;le of St. Lawrence. The next day, at noon, our lati|tude was 64&deg; 8&prime;, longitude 188&deg;; the i&s;land of St. Lawrence bearing &s;outh one quarter ea&s;t, at the di&s;tance of &s;even leagues.</P>
<P>In the afternoon, a fre&s;h breeze ari&s;ing from the ea&s;t, we &s;teered to the &s;outh-&s;outh-we&s;t, and quickly lo&s;t &s;ight of St. Lawrence. On Saturday the &s;eventh, at twelve o'clock, the latitude was 59&deg; 38&prime; and the longitude 183&deg;. We had a calm in the afternoon, and caught a great number of cod, in &s;eventy-eight fathoms of water. From
<PB N="64" REF="030274_1352_0FE578C8B18F7060">
this period to the 17th, we were making the be&s;t of our way towards the &s;outh, without any re|markable occurence, except that the wind blow|ing from the we&s;t, forced us more to the ea&s;tward than we wi&s;hed, it being our intention to make Beering's I&s;land.</P>
<P>On Thursday the 17th, between four and five in the morning, we de&s;cried land to the north-we&s;t, which we could not approach, as the wind blew from that quarter. Ac mid-day, the lati|tude was 53&deg; 49&prime;, and the longitude 168&deg; 5&prime;. The land in view bore north by we&s;t, at the di&s;tance of twelve or fourteen leagues. This land we ima|gine to be the i&s;land Mednoi, which is placed in the Ru&s;&s;ian charts to the &s;outh-ea&s;t of Beering's I&s;land. It is elevated land, and was at this time apparently free from &s;now. We reckon it to be in the latitude of 54&deg; 28&prime;, and the longitude of 167&deg; 52&prime;. We did not &s;trike ground with one hundred and fifty fathoms of line.</P>
<P>Captain Clerke being now no longer able to get out of his bed, &s;ignified his de&s;ire, that the officers would receive their orders from Mr. King; and directed that we &s;hould repair, with all convenient &s;peed, to the bay of Awat&s;ka. The wind continuing we&s;terly, we &s;teered a &s;outh|erly cour&s;e, till early in the morning of the 19th; when, after rain of a few hours continuance, it blew from the ea&s;t, and increa&s;ed to a &s;trong gale. We made the mo&s;t of it while it la&s;ted,
<PB N="65" REF="030274_1353_0FE578C34D71B238">
by &s;tanding towards the we&s;t, with all the &s;ail we could bear. The next day, the wind varying to the &s;outh-we&s;t, we &s;teered a we&s;t-north-we&s;t cour&s;e. The latitude, at noon, was 53&deg; 7&prime;, and the longitude 162&deg; 49&prime;. On the 21&s;t, between five and &s;ix in the morning, we perceived a very lofty peaked mountain on the coa&s;t of Kamt&s;|chatka, known by the name of Chepoon&s;koi Mountain, bearing north-we&s;t-by-north, at the di&s;tance of between twenty-five and thirty leagues. At noon the coa&s;t was ob&s;erved to extend from north-by-ea&s;t to we&s;t, with a very great hazine&s;s upon it; and it was about twelve leagues di&s;tant. We had light airs during the remainder of this, as well as the following day, and found no ground within one hundred and forty fathoms of line.</P>
<P>At nine o'clock in the morning, on Sunday the 22d of Augu&s;t, Capt. Charles Clerke expired, in the thirty-eighth year of his age. His death was occa&s;ioned by a con&s;umption, which had manife&s;tly commenced before his departure from England, and of which he had lingered, during the whole continuance of the voyage. His very gradual decay, had for a long time rendered him a melan|choly object to his friends; but the firmne&s;s and equanimity with which he bore it, the con|&s;tant flow of good &s;pirits, which he retained even to the la&s;t hour, and a chearful re&s;ignation to his fate, furni&s;hed them with &s;ome con&s;olation. It was impo&s;&s;ible, not to feel an uncommon degree
<PB N="66" REF="030274_1354_0FE578882F40D128">
of compa&s;&s;ion for a gentleman, who had experi|enced a &s;eries of tho&s;e difficulties and hard&s;hips, which mu&s;t be the inevitable lot of every &s;eamen, and under which he at la&s;t &s;unk. He was bred to the navy from his youth, and had been in many engagements during the war which began in the year 1756. In the action between the Bellona and Courageux, he was &s;tationed in the mizen|top, and was carried overboard with the ma&s;t; but was afterwards taken up, without having re|ceived the lea&s;t injury. He was mid&s;hipman on board the Dolphin, commanded by Commodore Byron, when &s;he fir&s;t &s;ailed round the world; and was afterwards on the American &s;tation. In the year 1768, he engaged in a &s;econd voyage round the world, in the &s;ituation of ma&s;ter's mate of the Endeavour; and, during the expedition, &s;uc|ceeded to a lieutenancy. In the Re&s;olution he made a third voyage round the world, in the ca|pacity of &s;econd lieutenant: and in a &s;hort time after his return, in 1775, he was appointed ma&s;|ter and commander. In the pre&s;ent expedition, he was appointed captain of the Di&s;covery, and to accompany Captain Cook. By the calamitous death of the other, he naturally &s;ucceeded, as has been already related, to the chief command.</P>
<P>It would &s;avour of inju&s;tice and ingratitude to his memory, not to mention, that, during the &s;hort time he commanded the expedition, he was mo&s;t remarkably zealous for its &s;ucce&s;s. When
<PB N="67" REF="030274_1355_0FE5791B456F72F0">
the principal command devolved upon him, his health began rapidly to decline; and he was un|equal in every re&s;pect, to encounter the &s;everity of a high northern climate. The vigour of his mind, however, was not, in the lea&s;t, impaired by the decay of his body: and though he was perfectly &s;en&s;ible, that his delaying to return to a warmer climate, was depriving him&s;elf of the only chance of recovery; yet, &s;o attentive was he to his duty, that he was determined not to &s;uffer his own &s;ituation to bias his judgment to the prejudice of the &s;ervice&punc; he therefore per&s;evered in the &s;earch of a pa&s;&s;age, till every officer in the expedition, declared they were of opinion it was impracticable, and that any farther attempts would be equally hazardous and ineffectual.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>CAPTAIN King &s;ent a me&s;&s;enger to Captain Gore, to acquaint him with the death of Captain Clerke, who brought a letter from Cap|tain
<PB N="69" REF="030274_1357_0FE578E4F34D8798">
Gore, containing an order for Captain King to exert his utmo&s;t endeavours to keep in com|pany with the Di&s;covery, and, if a &s;eparation &s;hould happen, to repair, as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible to St. Peter and St. Paul. Our latitude, at noon, was 53&deg; 8&prime; north, and our longitude 160&deg; 40&prime; ea&s;t; Cheepoon&s;koi No&s;s then bearing we&s;t. In the afternoon, we had light airs, which continued till noon on the 23d; when, a fre&s;h breeze &s;pringing up from the ea&s;t, we &s;teered for the entrance of Awat&s;ka-bay; which we &s;aw about &s;ix in the evening, bearing we&s;t-north-we&s;t, di&s;tant about five leagues. At eight, the light-hou&s;e, which now furni&s;hed a good light, was about three miles di&s;tant, and bore north-we&s;t-by-we&s;t. It was now a perfect calm; but, as the tide was favour|able, the boats were &s;ent a-head, and towed be|yond the narrow parts of the entrance. On the 24th, at one in the morning, we dropped anchor, the ebb tide then &s;etting again&s;t us.</P>
<P>We weighed about nine o'clock, and went up the bay with light airs, which being afterwards &s;ucceeded by a light breeze, we anchored before three in the harbour of St. Peter and St. Paul; having up our en&s;ign half &s;taff, as the body of our late Captain was in the ve&s;&s;el; and the Di&s;|covery followed us in a very &s;hort time.</P>
<P>Soon after we had anchored, we were vi&s;ited by our old friend, the Serjeant, (&s;till the command|ing officer of the place) who brought with him
<PB N="70" REF="030274_1358_0FE5792C7438AAE8">
a pre&s;ent of berries, intended for Captain Clerke. He was much affected at hearing of his death, and &s;eeing the coffin wherein his body was de|po&s;ited. As the decea&s;ed Captain had particu|larly reque&s;ted to be buried on &s;hore, and gave the preference to the church at Paratounca, we embraced this opportunity of con&s;ulting with the Serjeant, about the nece&s;&s;ary &s;teps to be pur&s;ued upon the occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>After much conver&s;ation on this &s;ubject, which was very imperfectly carried on, for want of an interpreter, we gathered intelligence that de L'I&s;le, and &s;ome other Ru&s;&s;ian gentlemen, who had died here, were buried near the barracks, at the <HI>o&s;trog</HI> of St. Peter and St. Paul; and that this place would certainly be more eligible than Paratounca, as the church was &s;hortly to be re|moved thither. We, therefore, determined to wait the arrival of the Prie&s;t of Paratounca, who was immediately to be &s;ent for, as being the per|&s;on be&s;t qualified to give us any information we required upon the &s;ubject. The Serjeant, at the &s;ame time, expre&s;&s;ed his intentions of &s;ending an expre&s;s to the commander of Bolcheret&s;k, with intelligence of our arrival; when Captain Gore begged to avail him&s;elf of that opportunity of con|veying a letter to him, wherein he reque&s;ted that &s;ixteen head of black cattle might be &s;ent with all po&s;&s;ible di&s;patch. And, as the commander was unacquainted with any language except his
<PB N="71" REF="030274_1359_0FE57909B315A300">
own, the particulars of our reque&s;t were commu|nicated to the Serjeant, who not only undertook to &s;end the letter, but al&s;o an explanation of its contents.</P>
<P>It was a general remark among us that, though the face of the country had improved in its ap|pearance &s;ince we had left it, the Ru&s;&s;ians looked even wor&s;e than they did then. They made the very &s;ame ob&s;ervation with re&s;pect to us; and, as neither party &s;eemed plea&s;ed with the di&s;covery, we mutually con&s;oled our&s;elves by ca&s;ting the blame upon the country, who&s;e verdant and lively complexion, had occa&s;ioned an appearance of &s;al|lowne&s;s on our own.</P>
<P>Though the eruption of the volcano was &s;o extremely violent when we quitted the bay, we were informed that no damage had been received from it here. Several &s;tones, however, that were as large as a goo&s;e's egg, had fallen at the <HI>o&s;trog.</HI> This was the principal news we had to enquire after, and all the intelligence they had to com|municate to us, excepting that of Sopo&s;nicoff's arrival from Oonala&s;hka, who took charge of the pacquet &s;ent by Captain Cook to the Admiralty, and which, we had the plea&s;ure to find, had been forwarded.</P>
<P>On the 25th of Augu&s;t, in the morning, Cap|tain Gore, in con&s;equence of the death of Cap|tain Clerke, made out the new commi&s;&s;ions. He appointed him&s;elf to the command of the Re&s;o|lution,
<PB N="72" REF="030274_1360_0FE578CE6963B7E8">
and Mr. King to that of the Di&s;covery&punc; Mr. Lanyan, who was ma&s;ter's mate of the Re|&s;olution, and who had been in that capacity in the former voyage, on board the Adventure, was appointed to the vacant lieutenancy. The fol|lowing arrangements were the con&s;equence of the&s;e promotions. Lieutenants Burney and Rick|man (from the Di&s;covery) were appointed fir&s;t and &s;econd Lieutenants of the Re&s;olution; and Lieu|tenant William&s;on, fir&s;t Lieutenant of the Di&s;|covery. Captain King, by the permi&s;&s;ion of Captain Gore, took in four mid&s;hipmen, who had rendered them&s;elves u&s;eful to him in a&s;tro|nomical calculations; and who&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;tance was become the more nece&s;&s;ary, as we had not an ephemeris for the pre&s;ent year. And, that a&s;tro|nomical ob&s;ervations might not be neglected to be made in either &s;hip, Mr. Bayly took Captain King's place in the Re&s;olution.</P>
<P>On the &s;ame day, we were attended by the worthy Prie&s;t of Paratounca. His expre&s;&s;ions of &s;orrow, at the death of Captain Clerke, did honour to his feelings. He confirmed what the Serjeant had related with regard to the intended removal of the Church, and a&s;&s;ured us the timber was actually preparing; but &s;ubmitted the choice of either place entirely to Captain Gore.</P>
<P>As the Di&s;covery had &s;uffered great injury from the ice, e&s;pecially on the 23d of July, and had continued exceedingly leaky ever &s;ince, it was
<PB N="73" REF="030274_1361_0FE5783B6595DF38">
apprehended that &s;ome of her timbers might have &s;tarted; the carpenters of the Re&s;olution were therefore &s;ent to a&s;&s;i&s;t tho&s;e of the Di&s;covery in repairing her; and they accordingly began to rip the damaged &s;heathing from the larboard bow. It was di&s;covered, by this operation, that three feet of third &s;trake were &s;taved, and the tim|bers &s;tarted. To accommodate tho&s;e who were to be employed on &s;hore, a tent was erected, and a party was &s;ent into the country, north of the harbour, to fell timber. The ob&s;ervatories were placed at the we&s;t end of the village, near which was erected a tent, as an abode for the Captains Gore and King.</P>
<P>As we proceeded to remove the &s;heathing, the decayed &s;tate of the &s;hip's hull became more and more apparent. Eight feet of a plank in the wale were &s;o exceedingly rotton, that we were obliged to &s;hift it the next morning. We were now totally at a &s;tand, as nothing could be found to replace it in either &s;hip, without cutting up a top-ma&s;t; which ought to be the la&s;t expedient to have recour&s;e to. In the afternoon, the carpen|ters were di&s;patched in &s;earch of a tree of a proper &s;ize for the purpo&s;e. Fortunately they di&s;covered a birch, which was probably the only one of &s;ufficient magnitude in the whole neighbourhood of the bay, and which we had &s;awed down when we were la&s;t here; con&s;equently it had the ad|vantage of being a little &s;ea&s;oned. This was
<PB N="74" REF="030274_1362_0FE578F4E4CC5578">
prepared on the &s;pot, and taken on board the Di&s;covery the next morning.</P>
<P>The &s;ea&s;on being now far advanced, Captain King was unwilling that any hindrance or delay &s;hould happen through him, to Captain Gore's farther views of di&s;covery, and therefore ordered the carpenters to rip off no more of the &s;heathing than &s;hould be found ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for re|pairing the damages occa&s;ioned by the ice. He was apprehen&s;ive of their meeting with more de|cayed planks, which he thought had better re|main in that &s;tate, than have their places &s;up|plied with green birch, even &s;uppo&s;ing it could be procured.</P>
<P>All hands were now fully employed in their &s;eparate departments, that we might be perfectly ready for &s;ea, by the time the carpenters had completed their bu&s;ineis. Four men were &s;et apart to haul the &s;eine for &s;almon, which were caught in immen&s;e quantities, and were of a mo&s;t excellent quality. After the wants of both &s;hips were &s;ufficiently &s;upplied, we daily &s;alted down almo&s;t a hog&s;head. We had four invalids, who were employed in gathering greens, and cooking for tho&s;e who were on &s;hore. We al&s;o landed our powder in order to have it dried; and the blubber of the &s;ea-hor&s;es, with which both &s;hips had completely furni&s;hed them&s;elves in our pa&s;|&s;age to the north, was now boiled down for oil, and was become a very nece&s;&s;ary article, having
<PB N="75" REF="030274_1363_0FE578466A5C2590">
long &s;ince expended all our candles. The cooper was al&s;o employed in his department.</P>
<P>Both &s;hips companies were thus fully engaged till Saturday afternoon, which was given up to every man (except the carpenters) to enable them to wa&s;h their linen, and get their clothes in toler|able order, that they might appear decently on the Sunday.</P>
<P>On Sunday the 29th, in the afternoon, we per|formed the la&s;t &s;ad offices to Captain Clerke. The officers and crew of the two ve&s;&s;els attended him in proce&s;&s;ion to the grave; the &s;hips, at the &s;ame time, firing minute guns; and, at the con|clu&s;ion of the &s;ervice, three vollies were fired by the marines. The body was interred under a tree, which &s;tands on a little eminence in the valley north of the harbour, where the &s;tore-hou&s;es and ho&s;pital are &s;ituated; this being, as Captain Gore &s;uppo&s;ed, &s;uch a &s;ituation as was mo&s;t con&s;onant to the wi&s;hes of the decea&s;ed. The Prie&s;t of Paratounca al&s;o recommended this &s;pot, imagining it would be very near the centre of the new church. This worthy pa&s;tor joined in the proce&s;&s;ion, walking with the gentleman who read the &s;ervice. All the Ru&s;&s;ians in the garri|&s;on a&s;&s;embled on the occa&s;ion, and re&s;pectfully a&s;&s;i&s;ted in the &s;olemnity.</P>
<P>On Monday the 30th, the &s;everal parties re|a&s;&s;umed their re&s;pective employments, as parti|cularly mentioned in the cour&s;e of the preceding
<PB N="76" REF="030274_1364_0FE578B700248B78">
week; and on the 2d of September, the carpen|ters proceeded to rip off &s;uch of the &s;heathing as had been injured by the ice, from the &s;tarboard-&s;ide; having fir&s;t &s;hifted the damaged planks, and repaired and caulked the &s;heathing of the larboard bow. Four feet of a plank were di&s;|covered in the third &s;trake under the wale, &s;o much &s;haken as to require to be replaced; which was accordingly done; and on the 3d, the &s;heath|ing was repaired.</P>
<P>In the afternoon of the 3d, we got &s;ome balla&s;t on board; after which we unhung the rudder, and cau&s;ed it to be conveyed on &s;hore, the lead of the pintles being much worn, and a con&s;ider|able part of the &s;heathing rubbed off. The car|penters of the Re&s;olution not being immediately wanted, this was put in proper order the next day; but finding the rudder immoderately heavy, (heavier indeed than that of the Re&s;olution) we let it remain on &s;hore to dry, and con&s;equently to become lighter.</P>
<P>An en&s;ign arrived this day from Bolcheret&s;k, with a letter from the commander of that place to Captain Gore; which we reque&s;ted the Serjeant to peru&s;e, and, by his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, we at length under&s;tood, that proper orders had been given re&s;pecting the cattle; and that in a few days we might expect to &s;ee them; and that Captain Shmaleff, who &s;ucceeded Major Behm in his command, would pay us a vi&s;it immediately on
<PB N="77" REF="030274_1365_0FE5793930DEFC80">
the arrival of a &s;loop which he expected from Okot&s;k. The bearer of the letter was the &s;on of Captain Lieutenant Synd, who, about eleven years ago, was appointed to the command of an expedition of di&s;covery between A&s;ia and Ame|rica, and now re&s;ided at Okot&s;k. He told us he was appointed to receive our directions, and to &s;upply us with every thing that our &s;ervice might require. That he &s;hould remain with us, till it was convenient for the commander to leave Bol|cheret&s;k; and then he was to return, or the gar|ri&s;on would be without an officer.</P>
<P>The Ru&s;&s;ians, in Kamt&s;chatka, could not fur|ni&s;h us with a better account of Synd than Mr. Coxe has given us; though they &s;eemed entirely di&s;po&s;ed to communicate what they really knew. Major Behm could only give us this general in|formation, that the expedition had mi&s;carried, and that the commander had been much cen&s;ured. It was evident that he had been on the coa&s;t of Africa, &s;outh of Cape Prince of Wales; and, as he was too far north to meet with &s;ea-otters, which the Ru&s;&s;ians &s;eem to have in view in all their attempts at di&s;coveries, it is probable, that his return without having made any, from whence commercial advantages might be reaped, was the cau&s;e of his di&s;grace, and on that account his voyage is &s;poken of with contempt by all the Ru&s;&s;ians.</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="030274_1366_0FE579429FCF91E8">But, to proceed; on the 5th of September, all the parties that were on &s;hore returned to the &s;hip, and were employed in &s;crubbing her bottom, and getting in &s;ome &s;hingle balla&s;t. Two of our guns, which had been &s;towed in the fore-hold, we now got up, and mounted them on the deck, as we were &s;hortly to vi&s;it tho&s;e nations, where our reception would probably be regulated by the re&s;pectability of our appearance. On the 8th, the Re&s;olution hauled on &s;hore, in order to repair &s;ome damages &s;he had received from the ice in her cut-water; and our carpenters, in their turn, were ordered to a&s;&s;i&s;t her.</P>
<P>We began, about this time, to make a &s;trong decoction from a &s;pecies of dwarf pine, which is very plentiful in this country, judging it would hereafter be u&s;eful in making beer, and that we might perhaps be able to procure &s;ugar, or a &s;ub&s;titute for it, to ferment with it, at Canton. We knew, however, it would be an admirable medicine for the &s;curvy, and therefore were par|ticularly de&s;irous of procuring a con&s;iderable &s;upply; as mo&s;t of the preventatives with which we had furni&s;hed our&s;elves, were either con|&s;umed, or had lo&s;t their efficacy through long keeping. When we had prepared about a hog&s;|head of it, the &s;hip's copper was found to be remarkably thin, and that in many places, it was even cracked. This obliged us to de&s;i&s;t,
<PB N="79" REF="030274_1367_0FE578EFAB183DE8">
and orders were given that, for the future, it &s;hould be u&s;ed as &s;paringly as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who may hereafter be engaged in long voyages, would act judiciou&s;ly if they provided them&s;elves with a &s;pare copper; or, at lea&s;t, they &s;hould be fully convinced that the copper, u&s;ually furni&s;hed, &s;hould be remarkably &s;trong and durable. The&s;e nece&s;&s;ary uten&s;ils are employed in &s;o many extra-&s;ervices, particularly in that im|portant one of brewing anti&s;corbutic decoctions, that &s;ome &s;uch provi&s;ion &s;eems ab&s;olutely nece&s;|&s;ary; and the former appears the more eligible, becau&s;e a much greater quantity of fuel would be con&s;umed in heating coppers that were very thick.</P>
<P>On Friday the 10th, the boats from both the &s;hips were ordered to tow a Ru&s;&s;ian galliot into the harbour, which had ju&s;t arrived from Okot&s;k. She had been no le&s;s than thirty-five days on her pa&s;&s;age, and, from the light-hou&s;e, had been ob&s;erved a fortnight before, beating up towards the mouth of the bay. The crew had, at that time, di&s;patched their only boat on &s;hore, in order to procure water, which they were much in need of; but, the wind increa&s;ing, the boat was lo&s;t; the galliot was again driven to &s;ea, and tho&s;e on board &s;uffered inconceivable hard&s;hips.</P>
<P>On board this galliot there were fifty &s;oldiers, their wives and children, they had al&s;o &s;everal pa&s;&s;engers, and their crew con&s;i&s;ted of twenty-five;
<PB N="80" REF="030274_1368_0FE579214E134198">
making, in the whole, upwards of an hun|dred per&s;ons; which, for a ve&s;&s;el of eighty tons, was a great number, e&s;pecially as &s;he was heavily laden with &s;tores and provi&s;ions. This galliot, and the &s;loop which we &s;aw here in May, are built in the manner of the Dutch doggers.</P>
<P>Soon after the ve&s;&s;el had come to anchor, we were vi&s;ited by a <HI>Pul-parouchich,</HI> or Sub-lieu|tenant, who arrived in her, and who was &s;ent to take the command of this place. Some of the &s;oldiers, we were informed, were intended to re|inforce the garri&s;on; and two pieces of cannon were brought on &s;hore, to &s;erve as an additional defence of the town. From the&s;e circum&s;tances, it is pretty apparent that the Ru&s;&s;ian commanders in Siberia, had, from our vi&s;iting this place, been induced to attend to the defencele&s;s &s;itua|tion of it; and the hone&s;t Serjeant &s;hrewdly ob|&s;erved, that, as we had found the way thither, others might do the &s;ame, who might not be &s;o welcome as our&s;elves.</P>
<P>Having repaired the damages which the Re&s;o|lution had &s;uffered by the ice, &s;he hauled off from the &s;hore the next morning; and, in the cour&s;e of the day, we got &s;ome pitch, tar, cordage, and twine from the galliot. Their &s;canty &s;tore rendered them unable to &s;upply us with canva&s;s, and they could not comply with our application for that article. She furni&s;hed us, however, with an hundred and forty &s;kins of flour, amounting
<PB N="81" REF="030274_1369_0FE57917D4A051B8">
to 13, 782 Engli&s;h pounds. Till this day, we had a continual cour&s;e of dry weather, but now a heavy rain &s;ucceeded, attended with &s;trong &s;qualls of wind, which occa&s;ioned us to &s;trike our yards and top-ma&s;ts.</P>
<P>Sunday the 12th, was a day of re&s;t: but, as the weather continued foul, our men could not employ them&s;elves in gathering the berries which grew in &s;uch va&s;t quantities about the coa&s;t, or amu&s;e them&s;elves by any other pa&s;time on &s;hore. En&s;ign Synd left us this day to return to Bolche|ret&s;k, with the remainder of the &s;oldiers who had arrived in the galliot. While he remained here, he had been our con&s;tant gue&s;t; and, on his father's account, we thought him in &s;ome degree belonging to us; and, as one of the family of di&s;coverers, entitled to a &s;hare of our e&s;teem.</P>
<P>The Serjeant, as being commander of the place, had hitherto been admitted to our tables; and his company was additionally welcome to us, becau&s;e he was &s;en&s;ible and quick in his con|ceptions; and comprehended, better than any other per&s;on, the few Ru&s;&s;ian words that we had acquired. Whil&s;t En&s;ign Synd remained, among us, he very politely &s;uffered him to enjoy the &s;ame privileges; but, when the new commander arrived from Okot&s;k, the Serjeant, for what cau&s;e we did not under&s;tand, fell into di&s;grace, and was no longer permitted to &s;it in the company of his own officers. Our endeavours to obtain in|dulgence
<PB N="82" REF="030274_1370_0FE5794425CF42A0">
for him, we perceived would have been ineffectual; for, though it would have been highly agreeable to us, it was, perhaps, incom|patible with their di&s;cipline.</P>
<P>On the 14th we had completed the &s;towage of the holds, got our wood and water on board, and were ready for &s;ea at a day's notice. But, it &s;hould be ob&s;erved, that, though every thing on board was in this degree of readine&s;s, we could not think of taking our departure, becau&s;e the cattle were not yet arrived from Verchnei; and fre&s;h provi&s;ions were now become the mo&s;t important article of our wants, and e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary for pre&s;erving the health of our people. As there was a pro&s;pect of fine weather, this was con&s;idered as a favourable opportunity of engaging in &s;ome amu&s;ement on &s;hore, and acquiring &s;ome little knowledge of the country. A party of bear hunting was therefore propo&s;ed by Captain Gore, and the propo&s;al was readily acceded to.</P>
<P>On Friday the 17th, we &s;et out on this expe|detion; which was deferred till that day, in order to give a little re&s;t to the Ho&s;podin Iva&s;kin, a new acquaintance who had arrived here on Wed|ne&s;day, and who was to be of our party. Major Behm had de&s;ired this gentleman, who u&s;ually re&s;ides at Verchnei, to attend us on our return to the harbour, and a&s;&s;i&s;t us as an interpreter; and, from what we had heard of him before his arri|val, our curio&s;ity to &s;ee him was much excited.</P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="030274_1371_0FE5793AB3FBF008">He is allied to a con&s;iderable family in Ru&s;&s;ia, and his father was a general in the &s;ervice of the empre&s;s. He received his education partly in Germany, and partly in France; he had been page to the empre&s;s Elizabeth, and bore an en&s;ign's commi&s;&s;ion in her guards. At &s;ixteen years of age he was <HI>knowted,</HI> had his no&s;e &s;lit, and was bani&s;hed to Siberia. He was afterwards tran&s;ported to Kamt&s;chatka, and had then re|&s;ided there thirty-one years. His per&s;on was tall and thin, and his vi&s;age furrowed with deep wrinkles. Old age was &s;trongly depicted in his whole figure, though he had hardly entered his fifty-fourth year.</P>
<P>Great was our di&s;appointment when we di&s;|covered, that he had &s;o totally forgotten the French and German languages as not to be able to &s;peak a &s;ingle &s;entence, nor readily to com|prehend any thing that was &s;aid to him in either of tho&s;e languages. Thus were we unfortunately deprived of what we expected would have fur|ni&s;hed a favourable opportunity of acquiring fur|ther information re&s;pecting this country. We al&s;o promi&s;ed our&s;elves much &s;atisfaction in hear|ing the hi&s;tory of this extraordinary man, which he might, perhaps, be induced to relate to &s;trangers who could probably be &s;erviceable to him, but who could not be &s;uppo&s;ed to take advantage from what he might &s;ay, to his prejudice.</P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="030274_1372_0FE579462629CA68">The cau&s;e of his bani&s;hment remained a &s;ecret to every one in this country, but it was generally &s;uppo&s;ed he had been guilty of &s;ome atrocious offence; e&s;pecially as &s;everal of the commanders of Kamt&s;chatka have exerted their intere&s;t to get him recalled, in the reign of the pre&s;ent empre&s;s; but, &s;o far from getting him recalled, they were not able to obtain a change of his place of bani&s;hment. He a&s;&s;ured us that, for twenty years, he had not ta&s;ted a mor&s;el of bread, nor had been allowed any kind of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence; but had lived, all that time with the Kamt&s;chadales, on what he had procured from the chace by his own activity and toil. Afterwards a &s;mall pen|&s;ion was allowed him, and his &s;ituation has been rendered much le&s;s intolerable, &s;ince Major Behm was appointed to the command. Being taken notice of by &s;o re&s;pectable a character, who often invited him to become his gue&s;t, others were induced to follow his example. The Major had al&s;o occa&s;ioned his pen&s;ion to be increa&s;ed to a hundred roubles a year, which is an en&s;ign's pay in every other part of the empre&s;s's dominions, but, in this province, all the officers have double pay. Major Behm informed us that he had ob|tained permi&s;&s;ion for him to go to Okot&s;k, where he was to re&s;ide in future; but that, at pre&s;ent, he &s;hould leave him behind, as he might probably be u&s;eful to us as an interpreter, on our return to</P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="030274_1373_0FE548E328473010">Orders having been given to the fir&s;t lieute|nants of both &s;hips, that the rigging &s;hould be repaired as far as the late &s;upply of &s;tores would permit, we proceeded on our hunting party, con|ducted by the corporal of the Kamt&s;chadales; but, previous to our looking out for game, we pro|ceeded to the head of Behm's Harbour, which is an inlet on the we&s;t &s;ide of the bay. This having been a favourite place of Major Behm's, we had named it after that officer, though by the natives it is called Tarein&s;ka.</P>
<P>As we advanced towards this harbour, we &s;aw the <HI>Toion</HI> of St. Peter and St. Paul, in a canoe having with him his wife and two children, and another inhabitant of Kamt&s;chatka. He had ju&s;t killed two &s;eals on an i&s;land in the entrance of the harbour, and was returning home with them, as well as with a large quantity of berries which he had gathered. The wind having veered to the &s;outh-we&s;t, in pur&s;uance of his advice we now changed our route, and, in&s;tead of proceeding up the harbour, took a northerly cour&s;e towards a pool of water, at a &s;mall di&s;tance from the mouth of the river Paratounca, which was much frequented by the bears.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as we had landed, the wind unfortu|nately veered to the ea&s;tward, and once more de|&s;troyed our hopes of meeting with any game; the Kamt&s;chadales having often a&s;&s;ured us, that there was no probability of finding any bears,
<PB N="86" REF="030274_1374_0FE5791FC972E260">
as we were to the windward; tho&s;e animals be|ing po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of extraordinary acutene&s;s in &s;cent|ing their pur&s;uers, which, under &s;uch circum|&s;tances, enabled them to avoid danger. We therefore returned to the boat, and, having pro|vided a tent for that purpo&s;e, pa&s;&s;ed the night upon the beach. The next day, being govern|ed by the opinion of our guides, we cro&s;&s;ed the bay, and proceeded to the head of Rokoweena Harbour; where we &s;ecured our boats, and af|terwards went on foot with all our baggage.</P>
<P>Having walked about five or &s;ix miles, we ar|rived at the &s;ea-&s;ide, three miles north of the light-hou&s;e head. From hence, a continued nar|row border of level ground adjoining to the &s;ea, extended it&s;elf towards Chepoon&s;koi No&s;s as far as we could &s;ee. It is entirely covered with heath, and produces berries in great abundance, e&s;pe|cially tho&s;e which are called crow and partridge berries.</P>
<P>We were told, that there was almo&s;t a certain|ty of finding a number of bears, feeding upon the&s;e berries; but, as the weather was &s;howery, it was unfavourable to us. Accordingly, how|ever, we pur&s;ued our cour&s;e along the plain; and, though &s;everal bears were &s;een at a di&s;tance, we could not by any means, get within &s;hot of them. This diver&s;ion was therefore changed to that of &s;pearing &s;almon, which we &s;aw in throngs, driving through the &s;urf into a &s;mall river. Here
<PB N="87" REF="030274_1375_0FE579411A18A230">
we could not help remarking the inferiority of the Kamt&s;chadales, at this kind of fi&s;hing, to the na|tives of Oonala&s;hka; neither were their in&s;tru|ments, though pointed with iron, near &s;o well adapt|ed to the purpo&s;e, nor fabricated with that neat|ne&s;s, which tho&s;e of the Americans were, though only pointed with bone. On a&s;king the cau&s;e of this inferiority, we were informed by the corporal, who had long re&s;ided among the Americans, that formerly the natives of Kamt&s;chatka u&s;ed &s;uch darts and &s;pears as tho&s;e of the Americans, and, like theirs, headed and barbed with bone, and were as dexterous as the latter in the manage|ment of them. We could not &s;ufficiently under|&s;tand each other to di&s;cover the real cau&s;e of this change, but &s;uppo&s;e it may be the effect of an imperfect &s;tate of improvement. Fortunately, however, the water afforded us a little provi&s;ion; for ill &s;ucce&s;s had not only attended us in the chace by land, but we had failed in our expecta|tions of &s;hooting wild-fowl, after having almo&s;t depended upon a &s;upply of them for our &s;ub&s;i&s;t|ence; and, on its failure, began to think it almo&s;t time to return to our head-quarters.</P>
<P>The Kamt&s;chadales who attended us, at length di&s;covered, that our not meeting with game was occa&s;ioned by our going in too large a party, and by the unavoidable noi&s;e that was the natural con&s;equence of it. This judicious remark in|duced us to &s;eparate; Captain King, Iva&s;kin, and
<PB N="88" REF="030274_1376_0FE5794A15F36E38">
the corporal, forming one party; the other con|&s;i&s;ting of Captain Gore, and the re&s;t of the com|pany. We pa&s;&s;ed the night under our tent, and, on the morning of the 19th, &s;et out by different routs, in order to make a kind of circuit round the country, and meet at St. Peter and St. Paul.</P>
<P>Captain King, and his party, took the cour&s;e of the river, at who&s;e mouth he had fi&s;hed for the &s;almon; and, after being completely &s;oaked with heavy rains the whole morning, they took &s;heller, about three in the afternoon, in &s;ome old <HI>balagans,</HI> which were the remains of a Kamt&s;cha|dale village, without having &s;een a &s;ingle bear in their long and tedious journey.</P>
<P>At fir&s;t we &s;eemed inclined to continue here all night, that we might re&s;ume the cha&s;e early in the morning; but, as the weather began to clear, and a fre&s;h breeze &s;prung up from a quarter ho&s;|tile to our de&s;igns, the Ho&s;podin, whom former &s;everities had rendered unable to endure fatigue, and who was now more particularly di&s;tre&s;&s;ed from having his &s;nuff-box exhau&s;ted of its con|tents, grew very importunate with us to re|turn home. The old corporal was extremely un|willing to con&s;ent, alledging, that we were at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance from the harbour, and that the badne&s;s of the way would probably hinder us from compleating our journey, before night had overtaken us. Iva&s;kin's entreaties, however, at length prevailed, and the corporal conducted us
<PB N="89" REF="030274_1377_0FE578901FEB47A8">
by the &s;ide of &s;everal &s;mall lakes, which are pretty numerous in the flat part of this country. They are from half a mile to two miles long, and ge|nerally about half a mile in breadth. The water in them is very clear and fre&s;h, and they abound with red-coloured fi&s;h, not unlike a &s;mall &s;almon, both in &s;hape and &s;ize. The margins of the&s;e lakes were u&s;ually covered with half-eaten fi&s;h, being fragments left by the bears, which occa&s;i|oned a mo&s;t intolerable &s;tench. We frequently arrived at places which had ju&s;t been quitted by the bears, but were never able to come within reach of them.</P>
<P>At night we reached the &s;hips, after having been full twelve hours upon our legs. Poor Iva&s;|kin &s;eemed perfectly overcome with fatigue, and was probably the more &s;en&s;ibly affected by it, for want of a &s;upply of &s;nuff; for, almo&s;t at every <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ep, his hand &s;unk mechanically into his pocket, and in&s;tantly ro&s;e again with his huge empty box. Ju&s;t as we arrived at the tent, the weather be|came exceedingly rough and wet, and we con|gratulated our&s;elves on our not having &s;taid another day from our general rendezvous. The Ho&s;podin's box was immediately repleni&s;hed, and, regaling upon a good &s;upper, we forgot the fatigues and di&s;appointments of our journey.</P>
<P>The next day (Monday the 20th) we received the di&s;agreeable intelligence, that our friend, the &s;erjeant, had &s;uffered corporal puni&s;hment, which
<PB N="90" REF="030274_1378_0FE57A315572E3F8">
had been inflicted on him by command of the old <HI>Put-parouchick.</HI> None of us could learn the cau&s;e of his di&s;plea&s;ure; but it was &s;uppo&s;ed to have ari&s;en from &s;ome little jealou&s;y, which had been excited by our civility to the former. Imagin|ing, however, that the offence, whatever it might be, could not merit a cha&s;ti&s;ement &s;o di&s;grace|ful, we were both &s;orry and angry at what had happened. The friendly and familiar terms on which we had lived with him, and the e&s;teem we were known to entertain for him, made the af|front appear per&s;onal to our&s;elves. For we had con&s;ulted the worthy Major Behm, who was like|wi&s;e the &s;erjeant's friend, how we could render him &s;ome &s;ervice, for the excellent order he had pre&s;erved in the <HI>o&s;trog</HI> during our &s;tay, and for his extreme readine&s;s to oblige us, upon every occa&s;ion that pre&s;ented it&s;elf. The Major &s;aid, a letter of recommendation to the Governor Ge|neral, would probably have a good effect; Cap|tain Clerke accordingly had given him one, which, together with his own repre&s;entations, he fully expected would get the &s;erjeant advanced in his profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>We were unwilling to remon&s;trate on this &s;ub|ject, till Captain Shmaleff &s;hould arrive. In|deed, our very imperfect knowledge of the lan|guage, would not permit us to enter into any di&s;|cu&s;&s;ion upon this bu&s;ine&s;s. But, when we were
<PB N="91" REF="030274_1379_0FE579AF45A4C360">
next vi&s;ited by the <HI>Put-parouchick,</HI> the coolne&s;s of our reception mu&s;t fully have te&s;tified our chagrin.</P>
<P>On Wedne&s;day, the 22d of September, being the anniver&s;ary of the coronation of George the Third, we fired twenty-one guns; and, in ho|nour of the day, prepared as elegant a fea&s;t as our &s;ituation would allow of. The arrival of Captain Shmaleff was announced the very moment we were &s;itting down to dinner. We were equally plea&s;ed and &s;urprized at this intelligence. Fir&s;t, becau&s;e he came &s;o opportunely to take a &s;hare in the fe&s;tivity of the day; and, in the next place, having lately been informed that the ef|fects of a &s;evere illne&s;s had rendered him unequal to the journey. We had the &s;atisfaction to hear that this had been merely an excu&s;e; that, know|ing we were di&s;tre&s;&s;ed for tea, &s;ugar, &amp;c. he was hurt at the idea of coming empty-handed, and therefore had deferred his &s;etting out, impatient|ly waiting for the arrival of a &s;loop from Okot&s;k; but hearing no intelligence of her, and fearing we &s;hould &s;ail before he had vi&s;ited us, he was re&s;olved to pro&s;ecute the journey, though he had nothing to pre&s;ent to us but apologies for the po|verty of Bolcheret&s;k.</P>
<P>He told us, at the &s;ame time, that the rea&s;on of our not having received the black cattle, which we had reque&s;ted to be &s;ent down, was, that the heavy rains at Verchnei, had ab&s;olutely prevented their &s;etting out. So much politene&s;s

and genero&s;ity demanded the be&s;t an&s;wer we were capable of making; and he was, the next day, &s;aluted with eleven guns, on coming on board the Re&s;olution: &s;amples and &s;pecimens of our curio&s;ities were then pre&s;ented to him; to which Captain Gore added a gold watch, and a fowling-piece. He was entertained on board the Di&s;co|very the next day, and on the 25th, he returned to Bolcheret&s;k.</P>
<P>No entreaties could prevail on him to extend his vi&s;it, having, as he a&s;&s;ured us, &s;ome expec|tations that the &s;ub-governor-general would ar|rive in the &s;loop which he expected from Okot&s;k, as he was then on a tour through all the provinces of the governor-general of Jakut&s;k. Without any application from us, he re-in&s;tated the &s;er|jeant in his command, before his departure, having re&s;olved to take the <HI>Put-parouchick</HI> with him. We al&s;o under&s;tood, that he was much offended with him for puni&s;hing the &s;erjeant, as there did not appear to be the &s;lighte&s;t grounds for inflicting &s;uch cha&s;ti&s;ement.</P>
<P>Encouraged by the Captain's great readine&s;s to oblige us, we ventured to reque&s;t a &s;mall fa|vour for another inhabitant of Kamt&s;chatka. It was to requite an hone&s;t old &s;oldier, who kept a kind of open hou&s;e for the inferior officers, and who had done a thou&s;and good offices, both for them and the whole crew. The Captain obliging|ly complied with our wi&s;hes, and dubbed him
<PB N="93" REF="030274_1381_0FE579A1563B3538">
in&s;tantly a corporal; telling him, at the &s;ame time, to thank the Engli&s;h officers for his very great promotion.</P>
<P>It may not here be unnece&s;&s;ary to remark, that the lower cla&s;s of officers in the Ru&s;&s;ian army, have a greater pre-eminence above the private men than tho&s;e in the Briti&s;h &s;ervice can po&s;&s;ibly conceive. It was, indeed, a matter of a&s;toni&s;h|ment to us, to &s;ee a &s;erjeant a&s;&s;ume all the &s;tate, and exact as much homage from tho&s;e beneath him, as though he had been a field officer. Be|&s;ides, there are &s;everal gradations of rank a|mong&s;t them, of which other countries are whol|ly ignorant; there being no le&s;s than four inter|mediate &s;teps between a &s;erjeant and a private &s;oldier; and many con&s;iderable advantages may probably ari&s;e from this &s;y&s;tem. Subordinate ranks in the &s;ea &s;ervice, are known to produce the mo&s;t &s;alutary effects, by creating emulation; and the officers of &s;uperior rank are thereby enabled to be&s;tow an adequate reward on almo&s;t every po&s;&s;ible degree of merit.</P>
<P>The di&s;cipline of the Ru&s;&s;ian army, though &s;o extremely remote from the &s;eat of government, is remarkable for its &s;trictne&s;s and &s;everity; not exempting even the commi&s;&s;ioned officers. Im|pri&s;onment, and bread and water diet, is the pu|ni&s;hment of the latter for incon&s;iderable offences. A good friend of ours, who was as an en&s;ign in this place, informed us, that the puni&s;hment he
<PB N="94" REF="030274_1382_0FE57A3976CE2AA8">
received for having been concerned in a drunken frolic, was three months impri&s;onment in the black hole, with bread and water only for his &s;ub&s;i&s;tence; which &s;o affected his whole nervous &s;y&s;tem, that he has never &s;ince enjoyed a &s;ufficient flow of &s;pirits to qualify him for a convivial meeting.</P>
<P>Captain King attended Captain Shmaleff as far as the entrance of Awat&s;ka river, and having taken leave of him, embraced that opportunity of vi&s;iting the prie&s;t of Paratounca. He attend|ed him to church on Sunday the 26th, when his whole congregation con&s;i&s;ted of his own family, three men, and the &s;ame number of boys, who a&s;&s;i&s;ted in the &s;inging; and the whole of the &s;er|vice was performed with great &s;olemnity and de|votion.</P>
<P>Though the church is built of wood, it is much &s;uperior to any building either in this town, or in that of St. Peter and St. Paul. Among the &s;everal paintings with which it is ornament|ed, are two pictures of St. Peter and St. Paul, which were pre&s;ented by Beering; and which might vie with the fir&s;t European performances in the intrin&s;ic riches of its drapery; the prin|cipal parts of it being compo&s;ed of thick plates of real &s;olid &s;ilver, &s;o fa&s;hioned as to imitate the foldings of the robes which decorate the figures, and fixed upon the canva&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="95" REF="030274_1383_0FE579F7F9D4B3E8">Another hunting party was &s;et on foot the next day, when Captain King &s;ubmitted him&s;elf to the direction of the pari&s;h clerk, who had ac|quired great reputation as a bear-hunter. About &s;un-&s;et they arrived at one of the larger lakes, where it was deemed nece&s;&s;ary to conceal them|&s;elves as much as po&s;&s;ible: this was ea&s;ily effect|ed among &s;ome long gra&s;s and bru&s;h-wood, of which there was great plenty near the water's edge. We had not been long in this &s;ituation, before our ears were agreeably &s;aluted with the growl|ing of bears, in almo&s;t every quarter round about us; and we &s;oon had the plea&s;ure of beholding one of them in the water, &s;wimming in a direct cour&s;e to where we lay concealed. At this time the moon &s;hone &s;o as to afford a con&s;iderable light; and, as the animal advanced towards us, three of us fired at it almo&s;t at the &s;ame in&s;tant. Immediately the bea&s;t turned &s;hort upon one &s;ide, and &s;et up a mo&s;t horrible noi&s;e; which was nei|ther yelling, growling, nor roaring, but a very extraordinary mixture of the whole three.</P>
<P>We could ea&s;ily perceive that the animal was &s;everely wounded, and that it reached the bank with difficulty; whence it retreated to &s;ome thick bu&s;hes not far di&s;tant, &s;till continuing to make that dreadful noi&s;e. The Kamt&s;chadales &s;up|po&s;ed it to be mortally wounded, and that it could proceed no farther; but judged it an act of imprudence to attempt to rou&s;e it again im|mediately.
<PB N="96" REF="030274_1384_0FE5799799797FE8">
It was then after nine o'clock; and, as the night became over-ca&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> a change of weather was to be apprehended, we thought it advi&s;eable to return home, and wait till morning for the gratification of our curio&s;ity; when we accordingly repaired to the &s;pot, and found the bear dead from the wounds it had received. It was a female and larger than the ordinary &s;ize. But, as this account of our hunting party may convey a wrong idea of the method u&s;ually pur|&s;ued in this &s;port, a few words may be nece&s;&s;ary to be added on this &s;ubject.</P>
<P>The natives generally contrive to reach the ground, frequented by the bears; about &s;un-&s;et. Their fir&s;t bu&s;ine&s;s when they arrive there, is to look out for their tracks, and to attend particu|larly to the fre&s;he&s;t of them; always paying a regard to the &s;ituation with re&s;pect to conceal|ment, and taking aim at the animal as it pa&s;&s;es by, or as it advances or goes from them. The&s;e tracks are numerous between the woods and the lakes, and are often found among the long &s;edgy gra&s;s and brakes on the margin of the water. Having determined upon a convenient &s;pot for concealment, the hunters fix their crutches in the ground, on which they re&s;t their firelocks, pointing them in a proper direction. They af|terwards kneel or lie down, as the circum&s;tances of their &s;ituations may require; and, having their
<PB N="97" REF="030274_1385_0FE5796A8DD7E648">
bear-&s;pears in readine&s;s by their &s;ide, wait the arrival of their game.</P>
<P>The&s;e precautions are extremely nece&s;&s;ary, on many accounts, that the hunters may make &s;ure of their mark: for the price of ammunition is &s;o high at Kamt&s;chatka, that the value of a bear will not purcha&s;e more of it than will load a mu&s;|quet four or five times. It is much more mate|rial on another con&s;ideration; for, if the fir&s;t &s;hot &s;hould not render the animal incapable of pur&s;uit, fatal con&s;equences too frequently en&s;ue. The enraged bea&s;t makes immedi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ly towards the place from whence the &s;ound and &s;moke i&s;&s;ue, and furiou&s;ly attacks his adver&s;aries. They have not &s;ufficient time to re-load their pieces, as the bear is &s;eldom &s;ired at till he comes within the di&s;tance of fifteen yards; therefore, if he &s;hould not happen to fall, they immediately prepare to receive him upon their &s;pears; their &s;afety de|pending, in a great mea&s;ure, on their giving him a mortal &s;tab as he advances towards them. Should he parry the thru&s;t, (which the&s;e animals are &s;ometimes enabled to do, by the &s;trength and agility of their paws) and break in upon his op|ponents, the conflict becomes dreadful, and it is &s;eldom that the lo&s;s of a &s;ingle life will &s;atisfy the bea&s;t's revenge.</P>
<P>The bu&s;ine&s;s or diver&s;ion of bear-hunting, is particularly dangerous at two &s;ea&s;ons of the year: in the &s;pring, when they fir&s;t i&s;&s;ue from their
<PB N="98" REF="030274_1386_0FE579812D394D10">
caves, after having &s;ub&s;i&s;ted the whole winter (as it is here po&s;itively a&s;&s;erted) &s;olely on &s;uck|ing their paws; and e&s;pecially if the fro&s;t &s;hould continue to be &s;evere, and the ice in the lakes is not broken up; as they cannot then have recour&s;e to their cu&s;tomary and expected food. Thus becoming exceedingly fami&s;hed, they grow fierce and &s;avage in proportion; pur&s;uing the inhabi|tants by the cent; and, prowling about at a di&s;tance from their u&s;ual tracks, dart upon them unawares. Under the&s;e circum&s;tances, as the natives have no idea of &s;hooting flying, or even running, or in any manner without re&s;ting their piece, they often fall a &s;acrifice to their rapacity. The time of their copulation, is the other dan|gerous &s;ea&s;on to meet with them; and that is u&s;ually about this time of the year.</P>
<P>We have already mentioned a remarkable in|&s;tance of natural affection in the&s;e animals. Many of a &s;imilar nature, and equally affecting, are fre|quently related by the Kamt&s;chadales; who, from this circum&s;tance, derive con&s;iderable advantage in hunting. They never pre&s;ume to &s;ire at a young bear, if the dam is upon the &s;pot; for, if the cub &s;hould happen to be killed, &s;he becomes enraged to an immoderate degree; and, if &s;he can only obtain a &s;ight of the offender, &s;he is &s;ure to be revenged of him, or die in the attempt. On the other hand, if the mother &s;hould be &s;hot, the cubs continue by her &s;ide after &s;he has been
<PB N="99" REF="030274_1387_0FE5794C4D025668">
a long time dead; exhibiting, by the mo&s;t af|fecting ge&s;tures and motions, the mo&s;t poignant affliction. The hunters, in&s;tead of commi&s;erating their di&s;tre&s;&s;es, embrace the&s;e opportunities of de&s;troying them. If the veracity of the Kamt&s;|chadales is to be depended on, the &s;agacity of the bears is as extraordinary as their natural af|fection.</P>
<P>Innumerable are the &s;tories which they relate to this effect. One remarkable in&s;tance, how|ever, we cannot avoid mentioning, as it is ad|mitted among the natives as a well-atte&s;ted fact. It is the &s;tratagem they put in practice to catch the bareins, which run too &s;wift for them to ex|pect &s;ucce&s;s in pur&s;uing them. The&s;e animals herd together in great numbers, and their u&s;ual haunts are low grounds, at the feet of rocks and precipices, where they delight in brow&s;ing. The bear pur&s;ues them by the &s;cent, till he obtains a view of them; and then advances warily, keep|ing in a &s;ituation above them; at the &s;ame time concealing him&s;elf among the rocks as he ap|proaches, till he is almo&s;t immedietely over them, and near enough to carry his purpo&s;e into execu|tion. Then, with his paws, he pu&s;hes down large pieces of the rock among&s;t the herd below. If he perceives that he has &s;ucceeded in maiming any of the flock, he immediately pur&s;ues them, and according to the injury the poor bareins have received, he either proves &s;ucce&s;sful in overtak|ing
<PB N="100" REF="030274_1388_0FE5799F922DB3A8">
them, or they e&s;cape by the rapidity of their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">light.</P>
<P>The Kamt&s;chadales acknowledge infinite obli|gations to the bears, for all the little progre&s;s they have hitherto made, as well in the &s;cience as the polite arts. They confe&s;s them&s;elves indebted wholly to tho&s;e animals for all their knowledge in phy&s;ic and &s;urgery; that, by ob&s;erving what herbs they have applied to the wounds they have receiv|ed, and what methods they have pur&s;ued when they were languid and out of order, they have ac|quired a knowledge of mo&s;t of tho&s;e &s;imples which they have now recour&s;e to, either as external or internal applications. But, the mo&s;t &s;ingular cir|cum&s;tance of all is, that they admit the bears to be their dancing-ma&s;ters; though the evidence of our own &s;en&s;es places this matter beyond all di&s;|pute; for, in the bear-dance of the Kamt&s;chadales, every ge&s;ture and attitude peculiar to that animal, was faithfully exhibited. All their other dances are &s;imilar to this in many particulars, and tho&s;e attitudes are thought to come the neare&s;t to per|fection, which mo&s;t re&s;emble the motions of the bear.</P>
<P>On the 28th of September, Captain King re|turned to the &s;hips, not a little plea&s;ed with his excur&s;ion, as it gave him an opportunity of &s;ee|ing a part of the country, and of ob&s;erving the actions of the Kamt&s;chadales when they were un|der

no re&s;traint, which evidently was not the ca&s;e when they were in the company of the Ru&s;&s;ians.</P>
<P>Nothing worth mentioning occurred till the 30th, when Captain Gore went to Paratounca, in order to have an e&s;cutcheon put up in the church, which had been prepaired by Mr. Web|ber. It had an in&s;cription on it, mentioning Captain Clerke's age and rank, and the nature of the expedition which he commanded at the time of his decea&s;e. To the tree, under which he was interred, a board was affixed with a &s;imilar in&s;crip|tion on it.</P>
<P>Captain Gore, before his departure, ordered Captain King to get the &s;hips out of the harbour, that they might be in readine&s;s to &s;ail. This, however, was prevented, by a violent gale of wind on the 1&s;t of October, which continued the whole day; but, on the 2d, both the ve&s;&s;els warped out of the harbour, and anchored in &s;even fathoms water, about a quarter of a mile from the <HI>o&s;trog.</HI> The day before we quitted the harbour the cattle from Verchnei arrived; and, that the men might have the full enjoyment of this &s;ea|&s;onable &s;upply, by eating it whil&s;t it was fre&s;h, Captain Gore determined to &s;tay in the &s;ame &s;ta|tion five or &s;ix days longer.</P>
<P>This time was far from being mi&s;applied, for the pumps, &s;ails, and rigging of each &s;hip re|ceived an additional repair. Captain King, hav|ing obtained permi&s;&s;ion to u&s;e the copper belong|ing
<PB N="102" REF="030274_1390_0FE579CF798115A8">
to the Re&s;olution, and being &s;upplied with mola&s;&s;es by Captain Gore, was enabled to brew a &s;ufficient quantity of beer to la&s;t the crew a fort|night, and to make ten additional puncheons of &s;trong &s;pruce e&s;&s;ence. This &s;upply was the more acceptable, as our la&s;t ca&s;k of &s;pirits was now &s;erving out, except a &s;mall quantity re&s;erved for ca&s;es of emergency.</P>
<P>As the 3d of October was the name-day of the Empre&s;s of Ru&s;&s;ia, we were perfectly inclined to &s;hew it every po&s;&s;ible re&s;pect. The prie&s;t of Pa|ratounca, Iva&s;kin, and the &s;erjeant, were invited to dine with us; and an entertainment was pre|pared for the two Toions of Paratounca, and St. Peter and St. Paul; as well as for the inferior officers of the garri&s;on, and the mo&s;t re&s;pectable of the Kamt&s;chadale inhabitants. All the other natives were invited to partake in common with the &s;hips companies; a pound of excellent beef being &s;erved out to every man, and the remainder of our &s;pirits was made into grog, and di&s;tributed among&s;t them. Twenty-one guns were fired upon the occa&s;ion; and, con&s;idering we were in a very remote part of the Empre&s;s's dominions, the whole was conducted in a manner not unworthy &s;o illu&s;trious a character.</P>
<P>On the 5th of October, we received a fre&s;h &s;upply of tea, &s;ugar, and tobacco, from Bolche|ret&s;k. Captain Shmaleff having met this pre&s;ent on his return, he &s;ent a letter with it, informing
<PB N="103" REF="030274_1391_0FE5798E63CD6BA8">
us that the &s;loop from Okot&s;k had arrived in his ab&s;ence, and that Madame Shmaleff had in&s;tantly di&s;patched a courier with the&s;e few pre&s;ents, re|que&s;ting our acceptance of them.</P>
<P>On the 6th and 7th of October, the appearance of foul weather prevented our unmooring; but on the 8th, we &s;ailed towards the mouth of the bay, and all the boats were hoi&s;ted in; but our progre&s;s was &s;topped by the wind veering to the &s;outh, which obliged us to drop anchor, the <HI>o&s;trog</HI> bearing north, at the di&s;tance of half a league. The wind blowing from the &s;ame quarter, and the weather being foggy all the forenoon on the 9th, we continued in our &s;tation.</P>
<P>At four in the afternoon of the &s;ame day, we again unmoored; but, whil&s;t we were rai&s;ing our la&s;t anchor, we were informed that the drum|mer of marines had fled from the boat, which had ju&s;t left the village, and that he had been lately &s;een with a Kamt&s;chadale woman, to whom he was known to have been much attached, and who had frequently importuned him to &s;tay behind. This man was entirely u&s;ele&s;s to us, having been rendered lame by a &s;welling in his knee; and, on that very account, Captain King was the more unwilling to leave him behind, le&s;t he &s;hould be|come a mi&s;erable burthen to him&s;elf, as well as to the Ru&s;&s;ians. He therefore applied to the &s;er|jeant to &s;end parties of his men in pur&s;uit of him; and, in the mean time, the &s;ailors vi&s;ited a well-known
<PB N="104" REF="030274_1392_0FE57A0A8F7CBCA8">
haunt of his in the neighbourhood, where the drummer and his woman were found together. On the return of our de&s;erter, we weighed anchor, and immediately followed the Re&s;olution.</P>
<P>As we have now taken our leave of St. Peter and St. Paul, a particular account of Awat&s;ka bay, and the adjoining coa&s;t, may not be unacceptable to the reader; as it is perhaps the &s;afe&s;t, and mo&s;t exten&s;ive harbour that has ever been di&s;covered; and the only one, in this part of the world, that can admit ve&s;&s;els of con&s;iderable burthen. The term bay, properly &s;peaking, is rather inapplica|ble to a place &s;o completely &s;heltered as Awat&s;ka; but when it is con&s;idered how loo&s;e and vague &s;ome navigators have been, in their denomina|tions of certain &s;ituations of &s;ea and land, as har|bours, bays, roads, &s;ounds, &amp;c. we are not &s;uf|ficiently warranted to exchange a popular name, for one that may perhaps &s;eem more con&s;i&s;tent with propriety.</P>
<P>The entrance into Awat&s;ka bay is in the lati|tude of 52&deg; 51&prime; north, and the longitude of 158&deg; 48&prime; ea&s;t. It lies in the bight of another exterior bay, formed by Cape Gavareea to the &s;outh, and Cheepoo&s;koi No&s;s to the north. The latter of the&s;e head-lands bears from the former, north-ea&s;t by north, and is thirty-two leagues di&s;tant. From Cape Gavareea to the entrance of Awat&s;ka Bay, the coa&s;t takes a northerly direction, and extends about eleven leagues. It con&s;i&s;ts of a
<PB N="105" REF="030274_1393_0FE579B9067D3D58">
chain of ragged cliffs and rocks, and, in many parts, pre&s;ents an appearance of bays or inlets; but on a nearer view, low ground was &s;een that connected the head-lands.</P>
<P>From the entrance of Awat&s;ka bay, Cheepoon|&s;koi No&s;s bears ea&s;t-north-ea&s;t, di&s;tant &s;eventeen leagues. The &s;hore, on this &s;ide, is flat and low, with hills behind, gradually ri&s;ing to a con&s;ider|able height. The latitude of Cape Gavareea is 52&deg; 21&prime;.</P>
<P>This remarkable difference of the land on the &s;ides of Awat&s;ka Bay, together with their diffe|rent bearings, are very proper guides to &s;teer for it, in coming from the &s;outhward; and when it is approached from the northward, Cheepoon&s;koi No&s;s becomes very con&s;picuous; it being a high projecting head-land, and is united to the conti|nent, by a large extent of level ground, lower than the No&s;s. Whether viewed from the north or &s;outh, it pre&s;ents the &s;ame appearance.</P>
<P>We have been rather particular in de&s;cribing this coa&s;t, having experienced the want of &s;uch a de&s;cription; for, if we had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a tolerably good account of the form of the coa&s;t on both &s;ides of Awat&s;ka Bay, we &s;hould, when we fir&s;t vi&s;ited it, have arrived there two days &s;ooner then we did, and con&s;equently have avoided part of the tempe&s;tuous weather, which we experienced in plying off the mouth of the harbour. Be&s;ides as the fogs are &s;o prevalent in the&s;e &s;eas, it often
<PB N="106" REF="030274_1394_0FE579CC14756188">
happens that an ob&s;ervation for a&s;certaining the latitude cannot be taken. It &s;hould al&s;o be con|&s;idered, that land makes a very deceptive appear|ance when covered with &s;now, or when viewed through an hazy atmo&s;phere; both which circum|&s;tances prevail here for a con&s;iderable part of the year, and render it nece&s;&s;ary for every mariner to be acquainted with as many di&s;criminating objects as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>If the weather &s;hould happen to be &s;ufficiently clear to admit a view of the mountains, both on the coa&s;t and its neighbourhood, the &s;ituation of Awat&s;ka bay may be preci&s;ely known, by the two high mountains to the &s;outh of it. That neare&s;t the bay is in the form of a &s;ugar-loaf; the other, which is more inland, is flat at the top, and not quite &s;o high. There are three very con&s;picuous mountains the north of the bay: that farthe&s;t to the we&s;t, appears to be highe&s;t; the next, which is a <HI>volcano</HI> mountain, may readily be known by the &s;moke i&s;&s;uing from its top. The third is the mo&s;t northerly, and might, with &s;ome propriety, be called a clu&s;ter of mountains, as it pre&s;ents &s;everal flat tops to our view.</P>
<P>When we got within the capes, and into the ea&s;tward bay, a light-hou&s;e on a perpendicular head-land, will point out the entrance of the bay of Awat&s;ka to the north. Many &s;unken rocks lie to the ea&s;tward of this head-land, &s;tretch|ing two or three miles into the &s;ea; and which,
<PB N="107" REF="030274_1395_0FE57A275A27A9D8">
with a moderate &s;ea or &s;well, will always &s;hew them&s;elves. A &s;mall round i&s;land lies four miles to the &s;outh of the entrance, principally com|po&s;ed of high pointed rocks, one of which is &s;trikingly remarkable, as being larger and more perpendicular than the re&s;t.</P>
<P>The entrance into the bay is, at fir&s;t, about three miles wide, and one mile and an half in the narrowe&s;t part; the length is four miles, in a north-north-we&s;t direction. A noble ba&s;on, of about twenty-five miles in circumference, lies within the mouth; in which are the harbours of Rakoweena to the ea&s;t, Tarcin&s;ka to the we&s;t, and St. Peter and St. Paul to the north.</P>
<P>The breadth of Tarcin&s;ka harbour is three miles, and the length about twelve. A narrow neck of land &s;eparates it from the &s;ea at the bot|tom, and it &s;tretches to the ea&s;t-&s;outh-ea&s;t. As far as we &s;urveyed, we never found le&s;s that &s;even fathoms water; but the ice hindered us from getting to the bottom of the harbour.</P>
<P>The entrance of the harbour of Rakoweena is impeded by a &s;hoal in the middle of the chan|nel, which, in general, makes it nece&s;&s;ary to warp in unle&s;s there &s;hould happen to be a lead|ing wind. Were it not for this circum&s;tance, this harbour would be preferable to the other two. Its breadth is from one mile to half a mile, and its length three miles, running in a &s;outh-ea&s;t

and ea&s;terly direction. It is from thirteen to three fathoms in depth.</P>
<P>One of the mo&s;t convenient little harbours we have &s;een, is St. Peter and St. Paul. Half a dozen &s;hips may be commodiou&s;ly moored in it, head and &s;tern; and it is, in every re&s;pect, con|venient for giving them any kind of repairs. The &s;outh &s;ide of this harbour is formed by a low, narrow, &s;andy neck, on which the <HI>o&s;trog</HI> is built. The mid-channel is only two hundred and &s;eventy feet acro&s;s, in which there is &s;ix fathoms and an half water; the deepe&s;t water within is &s;even fathoms; and all over a muddy bottom. Some inconvenience was, however, occa|&s;ioned by the toughne&s;s of the ground, which often broke the me&s;&s;enger, and made it trouble&s;ome to get the anchors up. At the head of this harbour there is a watering place.</P>
<P>There is a &s;hoal lying off the ea&s;tern harbour, and a &s;pit within the entrance, &s;tretching from the &s;outh-we&s;t &s;hore, having only three fathoms water over it. To &s;teer clear of the latter, a &s;mall i&s;land, or rather a large detached rock, on the we&s;t &s;hore of the enterance, mu&s;t be &s;hut in with the land to the &s;outh of it. In order to &s;teer clear of the former, the three needle-rocks, near the light-hou&s;e head, on the ea&s;t &s;hore of the entrance, mu&s;t be kept open with the head-lands to the northward of the fir&s;t &s;mall bending on the ea&s;t &s;ide of the entrance. In entering the har|bour

of St. Peter and St. Paul, and approaching the village, it is very nece&s;&s;ary to keep near the ea&s;tern &s;hore, to avoid a &s;pit which &s;tretches from the head-land, to the &s;outh-we&s;t of the <HI>o&s;trog.</HI></P>
<P>The time-keeper on board the Re&s;olution, which was exactly copied from Mr. Harri&s;on's, by Mr. Kendal, &s;topped on the 27th of April, a few days before our fir&s;t arrived in Awat&s;ka Bay. During the voyage, it had always been carefully attended to, not having been tru&s;ted, even for a moment, into any other hands than tho&s;e of Cap|tain Cook and Captain King. No accident, therefore, could po&s;&s;ibly have happened to it, to which its &s;topping could be attributed; nor could it proceed from the operation of inten&s;e cold, the thermometer being but very little below the freezing point.</P>
<P>When the failure of the time-piece was fir&s;t di&s;covered, the Captains Clerke and King, con|&s;ulted what mea&s;ures they &s;hould pur&s;ue; whether they &s;hould &s;uffer it to remain in a u&s;ele&s;s &s;tate, for the &s;atisfaction of the curious at home, where it would certainly be examined by proper judges; or &s;ubmit it to the in&s;pection of a &s;eaman on board, who had been regularly bred a watch-maker, in London, and who had given many &s;atisfactory proofs of his &s;kill in that profe&s;&s;ion, in repairing &s;everal watches upon the voyage.</P>
<P>Having experienced the accuracy of this time-piece, we were extremely unwilling to be deprived
<PB N="110" REF="030274_1398_0FE579A2DAA31B68">
of its advantages during the remaining part of the voyage; and that object appeared to us of more importance, than the &s;mall degree of pro|bability of deriving any material knowledge with regard to its mechani&s;m, by deferring the in|&s;pection of it till our return. Be&s;ides, it &s;hould be con&s;idered, that the watch had already been &s;ufficiently tried to a&s;certain its utility, as well in the former voyage, as during the three years we had now had it on board the Re&s;olution. There|fore, on the fir&s;t clear day after we arrived in Awat&s;ka bay, the time-piece was opened, in the pre&s;ence of Captain Clerke and Captain King. No part of the watch appeared to be broken; but, as the watch-maker was not able to make it go, he took off the cock and balance, and clean|ed the pivot-holes, which were extremely foul. The other parts of the work were al&s;o dirty. He then took off the dial-plate, and found a piece of dirt between two teeth of the wheel which carries the &s;econd hand, and attributed its &s;topping principally to this cau&s;e. After putting the work together, and oiling it very &s;paringly, the watch &s;eemed to go with freedom and regularity.</P>
<P>Captain King having orders to go the next day to Bolcheret&s;k, the time-keeper was left with Mr. Baily, in order to get its rate by comparing it with his watch and clock; who informed him, on his return, that it had gone very regularly for &s;ome days, never lo&s;ing more than &s;eventeen
<PB N="111" REF="030274_1399_0FE57A34D39AB128">
&s;econds a day, and afterwards &s;topped again. Upon its being a &s;econd time opened, its &s;topping &s;eemed to be occa&s;ioned by its having been badly put together on the fir&s;t opening of it. When it was again abju&s;ted, it gained above a minute a day and the watch-maker broke the balance-&s;pring in attempting to alter that and the regulator. He then made a new &s;pring, but the watch went &s;o irregularly afterwards, that we could make no farther u&s;e of it. The hone&s;t man was as much ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">grined as we were at our ill &s;ucce&s;s, which we were convinced was not &s;o much owing to his want of &s;kill, as to the mi&s;erable tools he had to work with, and the &s;tiffne&s;s his hands had contracted from his occupation as a &s;eaman.</P>
<P>At the full and change of the moon, it was high water at thirty-&s;ix minutes after four; and five feet eight inches was the greate&s;t ri&s;e. The tides were regular every twelve hours.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE penin&s;ula of Kamt&s;chatka, is &s;ituated on the ea&s;tern coa&s;t of A&s;ia, and extends from 52&deg; to 61&deg; north latitude; the longitude of its extremity to the &s;outh being 156&deg; 45&prime; ea&s;t. The i&s;thmus, joining it to the continent on the north, lies between the gulphs of Olutor&s;k and Pen&s;hin&s;k. Its extremity to the &s;outh, is Cape Lopatka; &s;o called from its re&s;embling the blade-bone of a man, which is the &s;ignification of that word. The whole penin&s;ula is &s;omewhat in the form of a &s;hoe; and its greate&s;t breadth is two hundred and thirty-&s;ix computed miles, being from the mouth of a river Tigil to that of the river Kamt&s;chatka; and, towards each extremity, it gradually becomes narrower.</P>
<P><PB N="113" REF="030274_1401_0FE57959D2108EB8">On the north, it is bounded by the country of the Koriacks; by the north Pacific Ocean to the &s;outh and ea&s;t; and by the &s;ea of Okot&s;k to the we&s;t. A chain of high mountains, from north to &s;outh, extend the whole length of the penin&s;ula, and almo&s;t equally divide it; whence &s;everal rivers take their ri&s;e, and make their cour&s;e into the Pacific Ocean, and the &s;ea of Okot&s;k.</P>
<P>The three principal rivers, are the Bolchoireka, or great river; the river Kamt&s;chatka; and the river Awat&s;ka. The fir&s;t di&s;charges it&s;elf into the &s;ea of Okot&s;k, and is navigable for the Ru&s;|&s;ian galliots, five leagues from its mouth, or within three leagues of Bolcheret&s;k, which is &s;itu|ated at the conflux of the two rivers, Golt&s;offka and the Bi&s;traia, which are here lo&s;t in the Bolcho|ireka. The &s;ource of the Bi&s;traia, which is no incon&s;iderable river, is derived from the &s;ame mountain as the river Kamt&s;chatka, but takes quite a contrary cour&s;e; by which means, the Kamt&s;chadales are enabled to tran&s;port their goods by water, almo&s;t acro&s;s the penin&s;ula.&mdash; The river Kamt&s;chatka continues about three hundred miles, in the direction of &s;outh to north; and, after winding round to the ea&s;tward, is re|ceived by the ocean, a little to the &s;outhward of Kamt&s;chatkoi No&s;s. To the north-we&s;t of the mouth of the Kamt&s;chatka, lies the great lake Nerpit&s;ch; from <HI>nerpi,</HI> a &s;eal; that lake abound|ing with tho&s;e animals. A fort, called Ni&s;hnei
<PB N="114" REF="030274_1402_0FE57984A46ACCB8">
Kamt&s;chatka <HI>o&s;trog,</HI> is &s;ituated about twenty miles up the river, where an ho&s;pital and barracks have been built by the Ru&s;&s;ians; and this place, we under&s;tood, is now become the principal mart in the country.</P>
<P>The &s;ource of the Awat&s;ka river, is from the mountains between the Bolchoireka and the Bi&s;|traia. After running two hundred miles, from north-we&s;t to the &s;outh-ea&s;t, it falls into Awat&s;ka bay. The Tigil is likewi&s;e a con&s;iderable river; it ri&s;es amid&s;t &s;ome high mountains, parallel with Kamt&s;chatkoi No&s;s, and empties it&s;elf into the &s;ea of Okot&s;k. The other rivers of this penin&s;ula, which are very numerous, are too incon&s;iderable to be particularly mentioned.</P>
<P>If we may judge of its &s;oil form its vegetable productions, it appears to be barren in the ex|treme. Neither about the bay, nor in our jour|ney to Bolcheret&s;k, nor in any of our hunting ex|hibitions, did we ever perceive the &s;malle&s;t &s;pot of ground, that had the appearance of a good green turf, or that &s;eemed capable of improve|ment by cultivation. Stunted trees were thinly &s;cattered over the whole face of the country, who&s;e bottoms were moffy, with a mixture of low heath, the whole re&s;embling Newfoundland in a mo&s;t &s;triking degree.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be admitted, however, that we &s;aw at Paratounca, three or four &s;tacks of mo&s;t excellent hay; and Major Behm a&s;&s;ured us, that the banks
<PB N="115" REF="030274_1403_0FE57961C3033D80">
of the Kamt&s;chatka, and the Bi&s;traia, as well as many other parts of the penin&s;ula, produce a quantity of gra&s;s of great &s;trength and height, which is mowed twice in every &s;ummer; and that the hay is particularly adapted to the fattening of cattle, being of a very &s;ucculent quality. It ap|peared, indeed, from the &s;ize and fatne&s;s of the thirty-&s;ix which we received from the Verchnei <HI>o&s;trog,</HI> that they mu&s;t have had the advantage of good gra&s;s and hay; for when we were &s;upplied with the fir&s;t twenty, it was ju&s;t the clo&s;e of the winter, the &s;now &s;till remaining on the ground; and probably they had fed only on hay for the &s;even preceding months. This agrees with Kra&s;|cheninicoff's account, who relates, that the coun|try which borders on the river Kamt&s;chatka, is much &s;uperior, in point of fertility, to that of either the north or &s;outh. Repeated experiments, he &s;ays, have been made, in different quarters near this river, in the culture of barley, rye, and oats, which &s;eldom failed of &s;ucce&s;s; and he &s;up|po&s;es, that wheat would grow in many parts, e&s;pecially near the &s;ource of the Bi&s;traia and Kamt&s;chatka, as well as in mo&s;t countries &s;ituated in the &s;ame latitude. The fertility of this part of the country may, perhaps, be occa&s;ioned by its lying in the wide&s;t part of the penin&s;ula, and, con&s;equently, at the farthe&s;t di&s;tance from the &s;ea on each &s;ide: as chilling fogs and drizzling weather generally prevail along the coa&s;t, and
<PB N="116" REF="030274_1404_0FE579C034DB8268">
cannot fail to render the parts adjacent incapable of improvement by agriculture.</P>
<P>The &s;everity of the climate, it may naturally be &s;uppo&s;ed, mu&s;t be in proportion to the &s;terility of the &s;oil, of which it is perhaps the cau&s;e. We fir&s;t &s;aw this country in the beginning of May, 1779, when it was covered with &s;now, from &s;ix to eight feet in depth. On the 6th of May we had &s;now, with the wind from north-ea&s;t. At noon, on the 8th, the thermometer &s;tood at 32&deg;; and &s;ome of our men were on that day ordered on &s;hore, to endeavour to cut wood; but their attempts were fruitle&s;s, the &s;now &s;till lying &s;o deep upon the ground. Nor could they proceed in this nece&s;&s;ary bu&s;ine&s;s, though tne party con|&s;i&s;ted of &s;tout and able fellows, till the 12th; when the thaw gradually advanced. In &s;ome places, the &s;ides of the hills were now free from &s;now; and it was principally melted on the low land by the beginning of June. On the 15th of that month, we &s;ailed out of the harbour: during our &s;tay, the winds generally blew from the ea&s;tward, and the &s;outh-ea&s;t was the mo&s;t pre|valent.</P>
<P>On this 24th of Augu&s;t, when we returned, the foliage of the trees, and vegatation in general, appeared to be in the height of profection. The weather, during the remainder of that month, and the whole of September, was very change|able, but not &s;evere. At the beginning of the
<PB N="117" REF="030274_1405_0FE57A1C8A631A78">
month, the winds were, in general, ea&s;terly; but afterwards got round to the we&s;t. The thermo|meter's greate&s;t height was 65&deg;, the lowe&s;t 40&deg;. The greate&s;t height of the barometer 30&deg;, the lowe&s;t 29&deg; 3&prime;. So that all the month of Septem|ber, a moderate degree of temperature prevailed. But when October began, the new fallen &s;now again covered the tops of the hills, and the wind continued we&s;terly.</P>
<P>In computing the &s;ea&s;ons here, &s;pring &s;hould certainly be omitted. Summer may be &s;aid to extend from t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> middle of June, till the middle of September; October may be con&s;idered as au|tumn; from which period to the middle of June, it is all dreary winter.</P>
<P>The climate, in the country adjacent to the river Kamt&s;chatka, is &s;aid to be as &s;erene and temperate, as in many parts of Siberia under the &s;ame latitude. This, probably, originates from the &s;ame cau&s;es, to which the fertility of the &s;oil in that part of the country, has been already at|tributed. The &s;terility of the ground, however, is not the only con&s;equence of the unfavourable temperature of the climate. The inhabitants are &s;ometimes prevented, by the uncertainty of the &s;ummer &s;ea&s;on, from providing a &s;ufficient &s;tock of dried fi&s;h, for their food in the winter; and the moi&s;ture of the air occa&s;ions worms to breed in them, which frequently de&s;troy, or &s;poil, the greate&s;t part.</P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="030274_1406_0FE57A1E0F9E8900">We had neither thunder nor lightning during our &s;tay at Kamt&s;chatka, excepting on the night of the eruption of the volcano; and we were told by the inhabitants, that they were not often troubled with either, and never but in a &s;light degree. The &s;everity of winter, and the dread|ful hurricanes of wind and &s;now which attend it, oblige the natives to retire to their &s;ubteraneous habitations, both for their &s;ecurity and warmth. We were informed by Major Behm, that the in|clemency of the winter of 1779, was &s;o great, that all intercour&s;e was &s;topped <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">tween the in|habitants for &s;everal weeks, no one daring to &s;tir from one habitation to another, &s;o fearful were they of being fro&s;t-bitten. The extreme rigour of climate, in &s;o low a latitude, may be attributed to its being &s;ituated to the ea&s;t of an immen&s;e uncultivated country, and to the prevalence of the we&s;terly winds over &s;o exten&s;ive and cold a con|tinent. The impetuo&s;ity of the winds, may be attributed to the &s;ubteraneous fires, and &s;ulphur|eous exhalations.</P>
<P>Volcanos are numerous in this penin&s;ula; only three of which have lately been &s;ubject to erup|tions. That in the neighbourhood or Awat&s;ka we have already mentioned; and there are others equally remarkable, according to Kra&s;cheninicoff.</P>
<P>The volcano of Tolbatchick is &s;ituated between the river Kamt&s;chatka and Tolbatchick, on a neck of land. The eruptions proceed from the
<PB N="119" REF="030274_1407_0FE57A200FF0EEC0">
&s;ummit of a high mountain, which terminates in pointed rocks. A whirlwind of flames i&s;&s;ued from it in the beginning of 1739, which reduced the fore&s;ts of the neighbouring mountains to a&s;hes. A cloud of &s;moke &s;ucceeded this, which &s;pread darkne&s;s over the whole country, but was di&s;&s;i|pated by a &s;hower of cinders, which covered the earth to the extent of thirty miles. Mr. Kra&s;che|ni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">icoff, who was then travelling from Bolchoi|reka to the Kamt&s;chatka <HI>o&s;trog,</HI> and not far from the mountain, &s;ays, the eruption was preceded by an alarming &s;ound in the woods, which, he thought, portended &s;ome dreadful &s;torm or hurri|cane; till three &s;ucce&s;&s;ive &s;hocks of an earthquake, with only a minute's interval between each, fully convinced him of its real cau&s;e; but that he was hindered, by the falling of the cinders, from ap|proaching nearer the mountain, or from proceed|ing on his journey.</P>
<P>On the top of the mountain, of Kamt&s;chatka, &s;uppo&s;ed to be by far the highe&s;t in the penin&s;ula, is the third volcano. A thick &s;moke ince&s;&s;antly a&s;cends from its &s;ummit, and it often has erup|tions of the mo&s;t dreadful kind; &s;ome of which were fre&s;h in the memories of the natives, and were frequently &s;poken of.</P>
<P>Springs of hot water are &s;aid to abound in this country. We have &s;een only that at Natcheekin <HI>o&s;trog,</HI> which has already been de&s;cribed. Seve|ral others are mentioned by Kra&s;cheninicoff, who
<PB N="120" REF="030274_1408_0FE579C2072010F0">
al&s;o taken notice of two pits or wells, at the bot|tom of which, the water boils with great impetu|o&s;ity; a dreadful noi&s;e i&s;&s;uing from them at the &s;ame time, and &s;o thick a vapour, that objects can|not be di&s;cerned through it.</P>
<P>Among the principal trees which fell under our notice, are the birch, the poplar, the alder, &s;everal &s;mall pieces of the willow, and two &s;orts of dwarfi&s;h cedars. One of the&s;e &s;orts grows up|on the coa&s;t, &s;eldom exceeding two feet in height, and creeping upon the ground. Of this our e&s;&s;ence for beer was made, and proved to be very proper for the purpo&s;e: the other, which grows much higher, is found on the mountains, and bears a kind of nut or apple. The old <HI>Toion</HI> at St. Peter and St. Paul informed us, that when Beering lay in that harbour, he taught them the u&s;e of the decoction of the&s;e cedars; which proved an admirable remedy for the &s;curvy; but, either from the &s;carcity of &s;ugar, or &s;ome other cau&s;e it is no longer u&s;ed among&s;t them.</P>
<P>Of the birch, which appears to be the mo&s;t common tree, we remarked three &s;orts. Two of them were large, and fit for timber, and differed from each other only in the colour and texture of the bark. The third is of a dwarfi&s;h kind. The natives apply this tree to a variety of u&s;es. When tapped, it yields a liquor in great abun|dance, which they drink without mixture, or any kind of preparation, as we frequently ob&s;erved
<PB N="121" REF="030274_1409_0FE5794FB3404510">
in our journey to Bolcheret&s;k. We drank &s;ome of it our&s;elves, and found it plea&s;ant and refre&s;h|ing, though &s;omewhat purgative. They convert the bark into ve&s;&s;els for their dome&s;tic purpo&s;es; and, and from the wood of this tree, are made their &s;ledges and canoes. Not only the birch, but every other kind of tree in the neighbourhood of the bay, were &s;tunted and very &s;mall; the na|tives are therefore obliged to go to a con&s;iderable di&s;tance up the country, to get wood of a proper &s;ize for their canoes, their <HI>balagans,</HI> and many other purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>Kra&s;cheninicoff al&s;o mentions the larch, a tree which grows only on the banks of the river Kamt&s;chatka; and tho&s;e which it receives. He al&s;o &s;ays, there are firs near the river Berezowa. Likewi&s;e the &s;ervice-tree, and two &s;pecies of the white thorn.</P>
<P>This penin&s;ula produces great abundance of the &s;hrub kind, as mountain a&s;h, junipers, ra&s;|berry bu&s;hes, and wild ro&s;e-trees. Al&s;o a variety of berries, as partridge-berries, blew-berries. The&s;e are gathered at proper &s;ea&s;ons, and pre|&s;erved by ma&s;hing them into a thick jam. They con&s;titute a con&s;iderable part of their winter pro|vi&s;ions, &s;erving as a general &s;auce to their dried fi&s;h. They al&s;o eat them in puddings, and in various other modes; and make decoctions of them for their common beverage.</P>
<P><PB N="122" REF="030274_1410_0FE579F61776A720">We found great quantities of whole&s;ome ve|getables in a wild &s;tate, &s;uch as chervil, garlic, onions, angelica, and wild celery. We al&s;o met with &s;ome excellent turnips, and turnip-radi&s;hes, upon a few &s;pots of ground in the vallies. This was the utmo&s;t extent of their garden cultivation; but, it is probable, that many of the hardy &s;orts of vegetables will thrive here (particularly tho&s;e who&s;e roots de&s;cend as carrots, par&s;nips, &amp;c. Major Behm told us, that many other &s;orts of kitchen vegetables had been tried, but without effect; that tho&s;e of the cabbage or lettuce kind would not head; and that, though beans and peas would grow vigorou&s;ly, and flower and pod, yet the pods would never fill. He al&s;o told us, that in experiments he made in different &s;orts of farinaceous grain, a &s;trong high blade &s;prung up, and even produced ears; but the latter never yielded flour.</P>
<P>This account of vegetables only relates to &s;uch parts of the country, as fell within our ob&s;erva|tion; near the river Kamt&s;chatka, where, as we have already ob&s;erved, both the &s;oil and climate is the be&s;t in the penin&s;ula, garden culture is at|tended to, and perhaps with &s;ucce&s;s; for, with the &s;econd drove of cattle which we received from Verchnei, we al&s;o received a pre&s;ent of cucum|bers, celery, &s;ome very large turnips, and other garden vegetables.</P>
<P><PB N="123" REF="030274_1411_0FE5795E33D0D0F8">Two plants are produced in this penin&s;ula, which de&s;erve particular attention.

The plant grows wild, and in great quantities: about the beginning of Au|gu&s;t, many women are employed in collecting the roots; which, after being dryed in the &s;un, are pre&s;erved for u&s;e. When we arrived the &s;e|cond time, it was at the conclu&s;ion of this harve&s;t, which we under&s;tood had fallen &s;hort of its u&s;ual produce. It is a maxim with the Kamt&s;chadales, that providence never de&s;erts them, for the &s;ea|&s;ons that are prejudicial to the <HI>&s;arana,</HI> are always favourable for fi&s;hing; and, on the contrary, an un&s;ucce&s;sful fi&s;hing month is always amply com|pen&s;ated by an exuberant <HI>&s;arana</HI> harve&s;t. This article is variou&s;ly employed in cookery. When roa&s;ted in embers, it is a better &s;ub&s;titute for bread than any thing the country produces.

When baked in an oven, and pounded, it &s;up|plies the place of flour and meal, and is mixed in all their &s;oups, and many of their other di&s;hes. It is extremely nouri&s;hing, has a plea&s;ant bitter flavour, and may be eaten daily without cloying. We partook of the&s;e roots, boiled in the manner of potatoes, and found them very whole&s;ome and agreeable. This plant is al&s;o produced at Oona|la&s;hka, where the roots of it, in like manner, con|&s;titute a con&s;iderable part of their food.</P>
<P><HI>Sweet gra&s;s</HI> is the name of the other plant al|luded to; the botanical de&s;cription of which is, <HI>Heracleum Sibericum foliis pinnatis, foliolis quinis, intermediis &s;en&s;&s;ilibus, corollulis uniformibus.</HI> HORT. UPSAL. 65. It was in the month of May that we took particular notice of it, when it was about eighteen inches in height, &s;trongly re&s;embled &s;edge, and was covered with a kind of white down not unlike the hoar-fro&s;t hanging upon it, and which might ea&s;ily be rubbed off. The ta&s;te of it is as &s;weet as that of &s;ugar, though very hot and pungent. It has a hollow &s;talk, which con|&s;i&s;ts of three or four joints, with large leaves, i&s;&s;u|ing from each. When this plant attains its full growth, it is about &s;ix feet in height. This plant was formerly a principal ingredient in cookery, among&s;t the Kamt&s;chadales; but, &s;ince the coun|try has been in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Ru&s;&s;ians, it has been chiefly appropriated to the purpo&s;e of di&s;tilation. It is gathered, prepared, and di&s;till|ed,
<PB N="125" REF="030274_1413_0FE57963A50E9A50">
in the following manner. Having cut the &s;talk which have leaves growing on them, and &s;craped the downy &s;ub&s;tance from their &s;urface, they are placed in &s;mall heaps till they begin to heat and &s;mell. When dry, they are put into &s;acks of matting, where they remain a few days, and are then gradually covered with a &s;weet &s;ac|charine powder, which exfudes from the hollow of the &s;talk. Only a quarter of a pound of powder is obtained from thirty-&s;ix pounds of the plant, in this &s;tate. The women who conduct this bu&s;i|ne&s;s, find it nece&s;&s;ary to defend their hands, with gloves, whil&s;t they are &s;craping the &s;talks, the rind being of &s;o acrid a quality, as even to ulcer|ate the part it touches.</P>
<P>In this &s;tate, the &s;pirit is drawn from the plant, by the following proce&s;s. Bundles of it are &s;teep|ed in hot water, and its fermentation promoted in a &s;mall ve&s;&s;el, with berries of the <HI>gimolo&s;t,</HI> or of the <HI>golubit&s;a;</HI> care being taken to clo&s;e the mouth of the ve&s;&s;el, and to keep it in a warm place whil&s;t it continues to ferment; which is often to &s;o violent a degree, as to agitate the ve&s;&s;el which contains it, and occa&s;ion a con&s;iderable noi&s;e. When this fir&s;t liquor is drawn off, more hot water is poured on, and a &s;econd made in the &s;ame manner. Both liquor and herbs are then put into a copper &s;till, and the &s;pirit is drawn off in the u&s;ual method. The liquor, thus prepared, is called by the natives <HI>raka,</HI> and has the &s;trength
<PB N="126" REF="030274_1414_0FE579D9C86DDA28">
of brandy. Seventy-two pounds of the plant, generally produce twenty-five pints of <HI>raka.</HI> Ac|cording to Steller, the &s;pirit di&s;tilled from this plant <HI>un&s;craped,</HI> is very pernicious to health, and produces &s;udden nervous di&s;orders.</P>
<P>Kra&s;cheninicoff mentions &s;everal other plants, from which decoctions are prepared; and which, when properly intermingled with their fi&s;h, make palatable di&s;hes. Such is the <HI>kipri,</HI> with which a plea&s;ant beverage is brewed; and, when this plant and the <HI>&s;weet-herb</HI> are boiled together, in the proportion of one to five of the latter, and properly fermented, a &s;trong and excellent vine|gar is obtained. The leaves are &s;ub&s;tituted for tea; and the pith, when dried, is introduced in many of their di&s;hes. He al&s;o mentions the <HI>mor|kovai,</HI> which is not unlike angelica; the <HI>kotkorica,</HI> the root of which is eaten green or dried; the <HI>ikoum,</HI> the <HI>utchichlei,</HI> and &s;everal others.</P>
<P>Before the Kamt&s;chadales were acquainted with fire arms, it is &s;aid, they poi&s;oned their &s;pears and arrows with a juice extracted from the root of the zgate; and that death was inevitable to every animal who had received a wound from them. The T&s;chut&s;ki are now reported to u&s;e the &s;ame drug, and for the very &s;ame purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>The materials of all the manufactures of Kamt&s;|chatka, according to Kra&s;cheninicoff, are fur|ni&s;hed by three plants. One of them is the <HI>triticum, radice perenni &s;piculis binis lanugino&s;is,</HI>
<PB N="127" REF="030274_1415_0FE57A3CC3673F10">
which is exceedingly plentiful along the coa&s;t. A &s;trong kind of matting is fabricated from the &s;traw of this gra&s;s; which is u&s;ed to cover their floors, as well as for bed-clothes, curtains, &s;acks, and many other dome&s;tic purpo&s;es. Little bags and ba&s;kets are al&s;o made of the &s;ame materials, and are applied to various u&s;es.</P>
<P>The <HI>bolotnaia</HI> grows in the mar&s;hes, and re|&s;embles <HI>cyperoides.</HI> It is gathered in the autumn, and is carded in the &s;ame manner as wool, with an in&s;trument made of the bones of the &s;ea-&s;wal|low. With this manufacture their new-born in|fants are &s;wathed, and it is u&s;ed for a covering next the &s;kin, after they cea&s;e to be infants. A kind of wadding is al&s;o formed of it, which is u&s;ed to give additional warmth to different parts of their clothing.</P>
<P>A vulgar well-known plant remains to be taken notice of, as being more e&s;&s;ential to their &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence than all which have been mentioned. It is the nettle; which, as neither hemp nor flax are produced in Kamt&s;chatka, &s;upplies materials for their fi&s;hing nets; and on which their exi&s;t|ence principally depends. For this purpo&s;e, nettles are u&s;ually cut down in Augu&s;t, and, after being hung in bundles under their balagans the remainder of the &s;ummer, they are manufactured like hemp. It is then &s;pun into thread with their fingers, and twi&s;ted round a &s;pindle; after which
<PB N="128" REF="030274_1416_0FE579D60AF413C0">
&s;everal threads may be twined together, if the pur|po&s;es for which it is de&s;igned requires it.</P>
<P>Many parts of this penin&s;ula would probably admit of &s;uch cultivation, as might contribute to the comfort and convenience of the inhabitants; yet, the number of wild animals it produces, mu&s;t always be con&s;idered as its real riches; and no labour can be &s;o productive of advantage, as what is employed upon their furrieries. And next to the&s;e, the animals that &s;upply them are to be con&s;idered. The&s;e are the fox, the <HI>zibeline,</HI> or &s;able; the &s;toat, or <HI>ermine</HI>; the <HI>i&s;atis,</HI> or arctic fox; the earle&s;s marmot; the varying hare; the wea&s;el; the glutton or <HI>wolverene;</HI> the wild &s;heep; rein-deer; bears; wolves; dogs.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t general object of the chace are foxes, with which this country abounds, and among which are a variety of colours. The mo&s;t com|mon &s;pecies is the &s;ame as the European, but their colours are more vivid and &s;hining. Some are of a dark, che&s;nut, others have dark-coloured &s;tripes; the bellies of &s;ome are black, when the other part of the body is of a light che&s;nut. Some are a black; others of a dark brown; others of a &s;tone-colour; and &s;ome few are entirely white; the la&s;t, however, are very &s;carce. The quality of their fur is much &s;uperior to that of the &s;ame animals in Siberia or America. Many artifices are put in practice by the hunters to de|&s;troy them. Traps of various kinds are prepared;
<PB N="129" REF="030274_1417_0FE579DE5F3EEAA8">
&s;ome to fall upon them, others to &s;ecure them by the feet, and others to catch them by the head. The&s;e are the mo&s;t common methods of taking them; but they have many ingenious contrivances for catching them in nets. Poi&s;oned baits are al&s;o u&s;ed, the <HI>nux vomica</HI> being generally em|ployed for that purpo&s;e. Still, however, the ani|mal pre&s;erves his character for craftine&s;s and cun|ning, in all climates, and upon all occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>Before the Kamt&s;chadales had any knowledge of the Ru&s;&s;ians, who in&s;tructed them in the u&s;e of fire-arms, they carried bows and arrows to the chace; but, &s;ince that period, almo&s;t every man among&s;t them is provided with a rifle-barrel gun; and, though he cannot u&s;e it with any extraordina|ry dexterity, he readily acknowledges its &s;uperiori|ty to the former in&s;truments.</P>
<P>The Kamt&s;chatka &s;ables are much larger than tho&s;e of Siberia, and their fur is thicker and brighter; but tho&s;e in the neighbourhood of the rivers Olekma and Vitime, are of a finer black. The &s;ables of the Tigil and Ouka, are &s;aid to be the be&s;t in Kamt&s;chatka, a pair of the&s;e being frequently &s;old for five pounds &s;terling. The wor&s;t are found in the &s;outhern extremity.</P>
<P>A rifle-barrel gun, of a very &s;mall bore, a net and a few bricks, are the whole apparatus of the &s;able hunters. With the fir&s;t, they &s;ometimes &s;hoot them, when they are &s;een on the trees; the net is u&s;ed in &s;urrounding the hollow trees; in
<PB N="130" REF="030274_1418_0FE57A25D662F500">
which they u&s;ually take refuge when pur&s;ued; and the bricks are put hot into the cavaties, in or|der to drive them out with the &s;moke.</P>
<P>For an account of the <HI>i&s;atis,</HI> or arctic fox, we mu&s;t refer the reader to Mr. Pennant's Arctic Zoology; the &s;kin of this animal is of little va|lue. The varying hare is neglected on that ac|count. They are very numerous, and always be|come perfectly white during the winter. In the beginning of May, we ob&s;erved &s;everal of this colour, but they were &s;o extremely &s;hy, as not to &s;uffer us to come within gun-&s;hot.</P>
<P>The earle&s;s marmot, or mountain rat, is a beau|tiful creature, much &s;maller than a &s;quirrel; and, like that animal, feeds upon roots and berries; &s;itting upon its hind legs whil&s;t it eats, and holding the food to its mouth with the paws. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;kin is in high e&s;timation among the Kamt&s;cha|dales; being warm, light, and of a bright &s;hining hue. Like the plumage of &s;ome birds, when it is viewed in different lights, it appears to be of various colours.</P>
<P>The <HI>ermine,</HI> or &s;toat, is little regarded here, and con&s;equently not much attended to by the hunters, its fur being of a very ordinary kind. We ob&s;erved &s;everal of the&s;e little creatures run|ning about, and we purcha&s;ed &s;ome of their &s;kins which were of a dirty yellow towards the belly, and the other parts were of a cloudy white. The wea&s;el is al&s;o neglected, and on the &s;ame account.</P>
<P><PB N="131" REF="030274_1419_0FE579E910F9B7E8">The &s;kin of the <HI>wolverene,</HI> or glutton, on the contrary, is in the highe&s;t repute; a Kamt&s;cha|dale looking upon him&s;elf as mo&s;t &s;plendidly at|tired, when a &s;mall quantity of this fur appears upon his garment. The women embelli&s;h their hair with its white pats, which is con&s;idered as the mo&s;t &s;uperlative piece of finery. In &s;hort, a &s;uper&s;titious opinion obtains among&s;t them, that the angels are clad with the &s;kins of tho&s;e ani|mals. This creature, it is &s;aid, may be ea&s;ily tamed, and in&s;tructed in a variety of entertaining tricks.</P>
<P>All the bears which we had an opportunity of &s;eeing, were of a dun brown colour; they gene|rally appear in a company of four or five together, and are frequently &s;een in the &s;ea&s;on when the fi&s;h quit the &s;ea, and pu&s;h, in great quantities, up the rivers. Fi&s;h is indeed their principal food. In the winter months they are &s;eldom vi&s;ible. Of the &s;kins of bears, warm mattre&s;&s;es and cover|ings for beds are made; together with comfort|able bonnets, and gloves, and harne&s;s for the &s;ledges. The fle&s;h, e&s;pecially the fat, is held in great e&s;timation.</P>
<P>The wolves appear only in the winter, when they are &s;aid to prowl about in large companies, in pur&s;uit of prey</P>
<P>Rein-deer, both wild and tame, are found in many parts of the penin&s;ula, but none in the neighbourhood of Awat&s;ka. It is remarkable,
<PB N="132" REF="030274_1420_0FE57A3B405A1298">
that the rein-deer have not been u&s;ed, in this na|tion, for the purpo&s;es of carriage, as they are by their neighbours to the north and ea&s;t. The de|mands of the natives, in their pre&s;ent &s;tate, are in|deed &s;ufficiently &s;upplied by their dogs; and the breed of Ru&s;&s;ian hor&s;es will probably &s;upply any future nece&s;&s;aries of the country. But as the u&s;e of dogs, in a great degree, precludes them from the advantage of rearing other dome&s;tic animals, it appears very extraordinary that they &s;hould not have preferred an animal &s;o much more powerful and gentle.</P>
<P>The wild mountain &s;heep, or <HI>argali,</HI> is in great plenty here; an animal unknown in Europe, ex|cept in Cor&s;ica and Sardinia. Its &s;kin re&s;embles that of the deer's, but it nearer approaches the goat, in its gait and general appearance. Its head is adorned with two large twi&s;ted horns, which, when the animal is at full growth, &s;ome|times weigh from twenty-five to thirty pounds; and are re&s;ted on the creature's back when it is running. The&s;e animals are remarkably &s;wift and active, frequent only the mo&s;t craggy and mountainous parts, and traver&s;e the &s;teepe&s;t rocks with an a&s;toni&s;hing agility. Of their horns, &s;poons, cups, and platters, are fabricated by the natives, who often have one of the latter hanging to a be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t, &s;erving them to drink out of, when on their hunting expeditions. This is a gregarious <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ni|mal.
<PB N="133" REF="030274_1421_0FE579ABE5A632E8">
It is extremely beautiful, and its fle&s;h is &s;weet and delicately flavoured.</P>
<P>The dogs of this country, as already ob&s;erved, re&s;emble the Pomeranian in mien and figure; but they are larger, and the hair is con&s;iderably coar&s;er. Their colours are various but that which mo&s;t prevails is a light dun, or a pale dirty yellow. The poor animals are all turned loo&s;e, about the latter end of May and are obliged to &s;hift for them&s;elves till the en&s;uing winter; but never fail to return to their re&s;pective homes, when the &s;now begins to make its appearance. In the winter, their food con&s;i&s;ts wholly of the head, back-bones, and entrails of &s;almon; which are pre&s;erved and dried for that purpo&s;e; and, even with this food, they are very &s;cantily &s;up|plied. The dogs mu&s;t certainly be very nume|rous, no le&s;s than five being yoked to a &s;ingle &s;ledge, and only one per&s;on carried in each &s;ledge. In our journey to Bolcheret&s;k, we had occa&s;ion for one hundred and thirty-nine, at the two &s;tages of Karatchin and Natcheekin. It is ob&s;ervable too, that bitches are never employed in this bu|&s;ine&s;s, nor dogs that have been ca&s;trated. The whelps are trained to the draft, by being fa&s;tened to &s;takes with leathern thongs, which are ela&s;tic, and having their food placed beyond their reach; and thus, by continually pulling and labouring to obtain a repa&s;t, they acquire &s;trength, and a
<PB N="134" REF="030274_1422_0FE57A1440229F48">
habit of drawing, both of which are e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary for their de&s;tined occupation.</P>
<P>Almo&s;t every kind of northern &s;ea-fowl, fre|quent the coa&s;t and bays of Kamt&s;chatka: and, among others, the &s;ea-eagles, but not in great plenty, as at Oonala&s;hka. The inland rivers are plentifully &s;tored with various &s;pecies of wild ducks; one of which, called by the natives <HI>aan|gitche,</HI> has a mo&s;t beautiful plumage. Its cry is equally &s;ingular and agreeable.</P>
<P>Another &s;pecies is called the mountain-duck, which according to Steller, is peculiar to Kamt&s;|chatka. The plumage of the drake is &s;ingularly beautiful. A variety of other water fowl were &s;een, which, from their magnitude, appeared to be of the wild goo&s;e kind.</P>
<P>We ob&s;erved, in pa&s;&s;ing through the woods, &s;ome eagles of a prodigious &s;ize, but of what &s;pe|cies we could not po&s;&s;ibly determine. There are &s;aid to be three different kinds. The fir&s;t is the black eagle, with a white head, tail, and legs; the eaglets of which are perfectly white. The &s;e|cond is improperly called the white eagle, though in reality, it is of a light grey. The third is the &s;tone-coloured eagle, which is a very common &s;ort. There are great numbers of the hawk, fal|con, and bu&s;tard kind, in this penin&s;ula.</P>
<P>Woodcocks, &s;nipes, and grou&s;e, are al&s;o found here. Swans are very numerous, and generally make a part of the repa&s;t at all public entertain|ments.
<PB N="135" REF="030274_1423_0FE5798C8D9D9498">
The va&s;t abundence of wild fowl, in this country, was &s;ufficiently manife&s;t from the many pre&s;ents we received, con&s;i&s;ting frequently of twenty brace at a time.</P>
<P>We &s;aw no amphibious animals on the coa&s;t, except &s;eals, which were in extreme plenty about the bay of Awat&s;ka. The others were, at that time, pur&s;uing the &s;almon, that were a&s;cending the rivers in large &s;hoals. Some of them, it is &s;aid, follow the fi&s;h into fre&s;h water, and frequent all the lakes which have a communication with the &s;ea.</P>
<P>The &s;ea-otters found here and tho&s;e which we met with at Nootka Sound, are exactly the &s;ame, and have already been particularly de&s;cribed. They were formerly in great abundance here; but &s;ince the Ru&s;&s;ians have opened a trade with the Chine&s;e for their &s;kins, where they bear a price &s;uperior to any other kind of fur, the hun|ters have been induced to be &s;o indefatigable in the pur&s;uit of them, that very few remain in the country. They are &s;till found among&s;t the Ku|rile I&s;lands, though the number is incon&s;iderable; but they are &s;uperior in quality to tho&s;e of Kamt&s;|chaka or Nootka Sound. It is &s;aid, that hardly a &s;ea otter is now to be found on Mednoi and Beering's I&s;land; though Muller informs us that they were exceedingly plentiful in his time.</P>
<P>A great variety of amphibious &s;ea-animals, are mentioned by the Ru&s;&s;ian voyages as frequenters
<PB N="136" REF="030274_1424_0FE579904E5ABE60">
of the&s;e coa&s;ts; but as we &s;aw no other kinds, this was probably the &s;ea&s;on of their migration.</P>
<P>Fi&s;h is certainly the &s;taple article of food among the inhabitants of this penin&s;ula; who cannot po&s;&s;ibly derive any con&s;iderable part of their &s;u&s;|tenance either from agriculture or cattle. The &s;oil, indeed, affords &s;ome whole&s;ome roots, and every part of the country produces great quantities of berries; but the&s;e alone could not po&s;&s;ibly &s;up|port the inhabitants; though they are extremely &s;alutary, as being proper correctives of the putre|&s;cent quality of their principal diet, dried fi&s;h. In &s;hort, fi&s;h may here be called the &s;taff of life, with more propriety than bread in any other country; for neither the inhabitants, nor their do|me&s;tic animals of the canine &s;pecies, could po&s;&s;ibly exi&s;t without it.</P>
<P>Whales are frequently &s;een in this country, and, when taken, &s;erve for a variety of u&s;es. Of the &s;kins, the inhabitants make the &s;oles of their &s;hoes, and belts and &s;traps for many other pur|po&s;es. The fle&s;h is eaten, and the fat is pre&s;erved for culinary u&s;es, and feeding their lamps. The whi&s;kers are highly &s;erviceable for &s;ewing the &s;eams of their canoes; nets are al&s;o made of them for the larger kind of fi&s;h, and they &s;hoe their &s;ledges with the under jaw-bones. Knives are formed from many of their bones; and the chains, which fa&s;ten the dogs together, were for|merly made of the &s;ame materials, though iron

ones are now generally u&s;ed. After cleaning their inte&s;tines, drying them, and blowing them like bladders, they depo&s;it their oil and grea&s;e in them; and they make excellent &s;nares of their nerves and veins; in &s;hort, there is no part of the whale that is not u&s;ed in this penin&s;ula.</P>
<P>We caught abundance of fine flat fi&s;h, trout, and herrings, from about the middle of May, till the 24th of June, the time of our departure. At one hawl, on the 15th of May, we dragged out upwards of three hundred flat fi&s;h, be&s;ides a con|&s;iderable quantity of &s;ea-trout. The former are firm and well-flavoured, &s;tudded with prickly knobs upon the back, like turbot, with dark brown &s;treaks, extending from the head towards the tail. The fir&s;t herring &s;ea&s;on commences about the latter end of May. They vi&s;it the coa&s;t in large &s;hoals, but continue there no con&s;iderable time. They quitted the bay before we &s;ailed out of it the fir&s;t time, but were returning in October. It has already been remarked, that the herrings here were excellent, and that many of our empty ca&s;ks were filled with them. Large quantities of extremely fine cod were taken, &s;ome of which were al&s;o &s;alted: and we caught, at different times, con&s;iderable quantities of &s;mall fi&s;h, which had the appearance of &s;melts.</P>
<P>But notwith&s;tanding this abundance of fi&s;h above-mentioned, it is on the &s;almon fi&s;hery alone that the inhabitants depend for their winter &s;u&s;te|nance.

On this coa&s;t, all the &s;pecies of the&s;e that are known to exi&s;t, are &s;aid to be found; and which were formerly characterized by the differ|ent times of their a&s;cending the rivers. It is al&s;o reported that, though &s;hoals of different &s;orts are &s;een floating up the rivers at the &s;ame time, they avoid mixing with each other; that they never fail to return to the river in which they were bred, but not till the third &s;ummer; that they never live to regain the &s;ea; that particular &s;pecies frequent certain rivers, and are not to be found in others, though the &s;ea receives them nearly at the &s;ame place.</P>
<P>About the middle of May, the fir&s;t &s;hoals of &s;almon enter the mouth of the Awat&s;ka. This kind is called <HI>tchavit&s;i,</HI> by the Kamt&s;chadales, and is the large&s;t and mo&s;t e&s;teemed. Three feet and a half is their u&s;ual length; and they are more than proportionally deep; their average weight being from thirty to forty pounds. The back is of a dark blue colour, with black &s;pots, and the tail is perfectly &s;traight. In all other re&s;pects, they re&s;emble our common &s;almon. They &s;wim with &s;uch velocity along the river, that the water is greatly agitated by their motion; and the na|tives, who are ever on the watch for them at their accu&s;tomed time, are convinced of their approach by this circum&s;tance, and drop their nets imme|diately before them. One of the fir&s;t that was taken was pre&s;ented to us, but not without ac|quainting

us that it was the highe&s;t compliment they could po&s;&s;ibly confer upon us. We are in|formed, by Kra&s;cheninicoff, that it was formerly the cu&s;tom, among the Kamt&s;chadales, to eat the fir&s;t fi&s;h they caught, in the mid&s;t of great re|joicings, accompanied with many &s;uper&s;titious ceremonies; and that, after they became &s;ubjects of Ru&s;&s;ia, it was long a matter of contention be|tween them who &s;hould be entitled to the fir&s;t. Their fi&s;hing &s;ea&s;on, for this &s;pecies, begins about the middle of May, and continues till the end of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">une.</P>
<P>There is a &s;maller &s;ort of &s;almon, weighing from about eight to fifteen pounds, known by the name of the red fi&s;h, which a&s;&s;emble in the bays, and at the mouths of the rivers, early in the month of June. From this time till towards the end of September, va&s;t quantities of them are taken upon the ea&s;tern and we&s;tern coa&s;ts, where the &s;ea receives any fre&s;h water; and al&s;o up the rivers, almo&s;t to their very &s;ource. Their me|thod of catching them in the bay of Awat&s;ka, is as follows: One end of the net is fa&s;tened to a large &s;tone at the &s;ide of the water, after which they pu&s;h off about twenty yards in a canoe, dropping their net as they proceed; then they turn, and extend the other part of the net in a line parallel on the &s;hore. Thus prepared, they carefully conceal them&s;elves in the boat, looking earne&s;tly for the fi&s;h, which u&s;ually hover ab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">t

the &s;hore, and who&s;e approach is known by a rippling in the water, till they have proceeded be|yond the boat. At that in&s;tant, they &s;hoot the canoe to &s;hore, and are almo&s;t certain of inclo&s;ing their prey. One of the&s;e nets is generally hawled by two men, with as much facility as our &s;eines are managed by a dozen, though our's are much &s;maller. We had very indifferent &s;ucce&s;s with our own method of hawling; but after receiving &s;ome friendly in&s;tructions from the Kamt&s;chadales, we were as &s;ucce&s;sful as they were. Their mode of fi&s;hing in the rivers, is to &s;hoot one net acro&s;s and haul another to it down the current.</P>
<P>All the lakes which communicate with the &s;ea, abound with fi&s;h which have much the appearance of &s;almon, and u&s;ually weigh about five or &s;ix pounds. The natives, we under&s;tand, did not think it worth their labour to catch them. The&s;e lakes being generally &s;hallow, the fi&s;h become an ea&s;y prey to the bears and dogs, in the &s;ummer &s;ea&s;on; and, from the quantities of bones appear|ing upon the banks, va&s;t numbers of them &s;eem to have been devoured.</P>
<P>The natives dry the principal part of their &s;al|mon, and &s;alt but very little of it. They cut a fi&s;h into three pieces; they take off the belly-piece fir&s;t, and then a &s;lice along each &s;ide of the back-bone. The belly-piece, which is e&s;teemed the be&s;t, is dried and &s;moked; the other &s;lices are dried in the air, and either eaten whole as a

</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE inhabitants of Kamt&s;chatka may be &s;aid to con&s;i&s;t of three &s;orts. The Kamt&s;cha|dales; the Ru&s;&s;ians, and Co&s;&s;acks; and a mix|ture produced by their intermarriages. We are informed by Mr. Steller, who was long re&s;ident in this country, and who was indefatigable in en|deavouring to acquire knowledge on this &s;ubject, that the Kamt&s;chadales are people of remote an|tiquity, and have inhabited this penin&s;ula for many ages; and that they doubtle&s;s de&s;cended from the Mungalians: though &s;ome have imagined they &s;prang from the Tongu&s;ian Tartars, and others from the Japane&s;e.</P>
<P>He endeavours to &s;upport the&s;e opinions by the following arguments: That they have no tradi|tion
<PB N="144" REF="030274_1432_0FE579CD994B2C88">
among them of their having migrated from any other country; that they believe they were created on this particular &s;pot, by their great god Koutkou, who prefers them to all his other crea|tures: that they are the happie&s;t of beings; and that their country far &s;urpa&s;&s;es any other; afford|ing means of gratification which cannot be ob|tained in other regions. Further to &s;upport his opinions, he &s;ays that they are perfectly acquaint|ed with all the plants which the penin&s;ula pro|duces, their qualities and their &s;everal u&s;es; a &s;pecies of knowledge of too exten&s;ive a na|ture to be acquired in a &s;hort time: that their in&s;truments and uten&s;ils are totally different from tho&s;e of any other nation; and are made &s;o ini|mitably neat and dexterous, as to be a &s;atisfactory demon&s;tration that they were invented by them|&s;elves, and mu&s;t have been long in arriving at &s;uch a pitch of perfection: that before the Ru&s;|&s;ians and Co&s;&s;acks came among&s;t them they had not the mo&s;t di&s;tant knowledge of any people, except the Koreki: that till very lately, they had not the &s;malle&s;t intercour&s;e with the Kuriles, and &s;till later that they had any knowledge of the Japane&s;e; that being acquired by means of a ve&s;&s;el which was &s;hipwrecked on their coa&s;t: and he further adds, that when the Ru&s;&s;ians fir&s;t got a footing in the country, they found it extremely populous.</P>
<P><PB N="145" REF="030274_1433_0FE5796C8E22FCF0">He &s;uppo&s;es them to be de&s;cended from the Mungalians, from the words in their language having &s;imilar terminations to tho&s;e of the Mun|galian Chine&s;e; and that, in both languages, the &s;ame principle of derivation is pre&s;erved: that they are generally &s;hort, their complexions &s;warthy, the face broad, the no&s;e &s;hort and flat, the eyes &s;mall and &s;unk, the legs &s;mall, and they have many other peculiarities which are to be ob&s;erved among the Munlgalians. He therefore concludes, that they fled to this penin&s;ula for &s;afety from the rapacity of the ea&s;tern conquerors, as the Lap|landers and others retreated to the extremities of the north, from the advances of the Europeans.</P>
<P>The Ru&s;&s;ians, having made them&s;elves ma&s;ters of that va&s;t extent of coa&s;t of the frozen &s;ea, e&s;ta|bli&s;hed po&s;ts and colonies, and appointed commi&s;|&s;aries to explore and &s;ubject the countries &s;till farther to the ea&s;t. They &s;oon di&s;covered that the wandering Koriacs inhabited part of the coa&s;t of the &s;ea of Okot&s;k, and they found no difficulty in making them tributary. The&s;e being at no great di&s;tance from the Kamt&s;chadales, with whom they had frequent intercour&s;e, a knowledge of Kamt&s;|chatka mu&s;t naturally follow.</P>
<P>To Feodot Alexeieff, a merchant, the honour of the fir&s;t di&s;covery is attributed, about the year 1648. That, being &s;eparated from &s;even other ve&s;&s;els by a &s;torm, he was driven upon the coa&s;t of Kamt&s;chatka, where he and his compa|nions
<PB N="146" REF="030274_1434_0FE579782A236638">
remained a whole winter, but they were afterwards cut off by the Koriacs. This was cor|roborated, in &s;ome degree, by Simeon De&s;hneff, who was commander of one of the &s;even ve&s;&s;els, and was driven on &s;hore near the mouth of the Anidir. But, as the&s;e di&s;coverers (if they really were &s;o) did not live to relate what they had di&s;|covered, a co&s;&s;ac, named Volodimir Atla&s;&s;off, is the fir&s;t acknowledged di&s;coverer of Kamt&s;|chatka.</P>
<P>He was &s;ent, in 1697, in the capacity of com|mi&s;&s;ary, from fort Jakut&s;k to the Anadir&s;k, with directions to call in the Koriacs to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, in order to di&s;cover, and make tributary, the countries beyond theirs. With &s;ixty Ru&s;&s;ian &s;oldiers, and as many co&s;&s;acks, he penetrated, in the year 1699, into the heart of the penin&s;ula, and gained the Tigil. In his progre&s;s he levied a tribute upon furs, and proceeded to the river Kamt&s;chatka on which he built an <HI>o&s;trog,</HI> now called Verchnei; and, leaving a garri&s;on of &s;ix|teen co&s;&s;acks, returned, in the year 1700, to Jakut&s;k with va&s;t quantities of valuable tributary furs. The&s;e he very judiciou&s;ly accompanied to Mo&s;cow, and was rewarded for his &s;ervices by the appointment of commander of the fort of Jakut&s;k; at the &s;ame time, received orders to return to Kamt&s;chatka, with a reinforcement of a hundred co&s;&s;acks, ammunition, and what|ever might conduce to the completion and &s;ettle|ment
<PB N="147" REF="030274_1435_0FE5799608F70370">
of his new di&s;coveries. Proceeding with his force towards the Anadir&s;k, he perceived a bark on the river Tungu&s;ka, which proved to be laden with Chine&s;e merchandize. He immedi|ately pillaged the ve&s;&s;el, in con&s;equence of which the owners remon&s;trated to the Ru&s;&s;ian court; he was &s;eized on at Jakut&s;k, and conducted to a pri&s;on.</P>
<P>All this time Potop Serioukoff, whom Atla&s;&s;off had left, enjoyed the quiet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the gar|ri&s;on of Verchnei; and, though his corps was too incon&s;iderable to enforce the payment of a tribute from the inhabitants, yet he had the ad|dre&s;s and management to traffic with them as a merchant, on very advantageous terms. His conciliating di&s;po&s;ition &s;o far gained him the e&s;teem of the natives of Kamt&s;chatka, that they lamented his departure, when he &s;et off to return to the Anadir&s;k. He and his party were, how|ever, attacked by the Koriacs, and unfortunately cut off in the year 1703. Several other commi&s;|&s;aries were &s;ucce&s;&s;ively &s;ent in to Kamt&s;chatka, during the di&s;grace and trial of Atla&s;&s;off.</P>
<P>Atla&s;&s;off was re&s;tored to his command in 1706, and entru&s;ted with the management of a &s;econd expedition into Kamt&s;chatka, after having re|ceived in&s;tructions to ingratiate him&s;elf into the favour of the natives by all peaceable and amicable means; but, on no con&s;ideration, to have re|cour&s;e to compul&s;ive mea&s;ures; but, &s;o far from
<PB N="148" REF="030274_1436_0FE57A163245FAD8">
paying any attention to the&s;e in&s;tructions, he rendered the natives extremely ho&s;tile to their new governors, by repeated acts of cruelty and inju&s;tice; and even alienated the affections of his, own people, in&s;omuch that it created a mutiny of the co&s;&s;acks, who demanded a new com|mander.</P>
<P>The co&s;&s;acks, having &s;ucceeded in di&s;placing Atla&s;&s;off, took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his effects; and hav|ing ta&s;ted the &s;weets of plunder, and living with|out di&s;cipline or controul, his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors were un|able to reduce them to order and &s;ubjection. No le&s;s than three &s;ucce&s;&s;ive commanders were a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated. From that period, to the grand re|volt of the Kamt&s;chadales in 1731, the hi&s;tory of this country pre&s;ents an unvaried detail of revolts, ma&s;&s;acres, and murders, in every part of the penin&s;ula.</P>
<P>This revolt was principally occa&s;ioned by the di&s;covery of a pa&s;&s;age from Okot&s;k, to the river Bo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">choireka, made by Co&s;mo So<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oloff. The Ru&s;&s;ians, before this period, could enter this country only on the &s;ide of the Anadir&s;k; which afforded frequent opportunities to the natives of plundering the tribute, as it was conveyed out of the penin&s;ula by &s;o long a journey. But, when this communication was di&s;covered, the tribute could be exported with &s;peed and &s;afety; and troops and military &s;tores might now be imported into the very heart of the country. The natives
<PB N="149" REF="030274_1437_0FE57A3EA551E8C8">
were convinced that this circum&s;tance would give the Ru&s;&s;ians &s;o great an advantage over them, as mu&s;t very &s;hortly confirm their dominion; and therefore they immediately re&s;olved to make one grand effort for their liberty.</P>
<P>Beering had, at this time, a &s;mall &s;quadron on the coa&s;t, and had di&s;patched what troops could be &s;pared from the country, to join Powlo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t&s;ki, in an expedition again&s;t the T&s;chut&s;ki. The time determined on, therefore, for carrying their plan into execution, was when Beering &s;hould have &s;et &s;ail. This was certainly a well-cho&s;en opportunity; and it is matter of a&s;toni&s;hment, that, notwith&s;taning this con&s;piracy was &s;o ge|neral that every native is &s;aid to have had his &s;hare in it, the whole was conducted with &s;uch &s;ecrecy, that the Ru&s;&s;ians had no &s;u&s;picion that any ho&s;tile mea&s;ures were meditating again&s;t them.</P>
<P>They were equally judicious in planning their other operations. A &s;trong body was in readi|ne&s;s to prevent any communication with the fort Anadir&s;k, and detached parties were &s;cattered on the ea&s;tein coa&s;t, in order to &s;eize any Ru&s;&s;ians that might accidentally arrive from Okot&s;k. Things were thus &s;ituated, when Cheekhaerdin, (who was then commi&s;&s;ary) was e&s;corted by the troops of the fort, with his tribute, from Verchnei to the mouth of the river Kamt&s;cha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ka, where a
<PB N="150" REF="030274_1438_0FE579FCB4069698">
ve&s;&s;el was to remove it, and convey it to the Anadir.</P>
<P>It was further re&s;oved on, that the revolt &s;hould not commence, till this ve&s;&s;el &s;hould be out at &s;ea; and &s;uch re&s;olution was communicated to the different chiefs. In con&s;equence of which the moment &s;he di&s;appeared, a mo&s;t dreadful ma&s;&s;acre began. Every Ru&s;&s;ian and Co&s;&s;ack that could be found, was immediately put to death, and their habitations were reduced to a&s;hes. A large party of them a&s;cended the river Kamt&s;chatka, took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the fort and <HI>o&s;trog,</HI> which had ju&s;t been quitted by the commi&s;&s;ary, and &s;lew all that were in it; and all the buildings were con&s;umed by fire, the fort and church only excepted. Here they received information that the Ru&s;&s;ian ve&s;&s;el which had got the commi&s;&s;ary on board, was &s;till remaining on the coa&s;t, and therefore re&s;olved to defend them&s;elves in the fort.</P>
<P>Fortunately the ve&s;&s;el was drived back to the harbour; for, had &s;he pro&s;ecuted her voyage, the utter extirpation of the Ru&s;&s;ians mu&s;t have en|&s;ued. The Co&s;&s;acks, on their landing, finding that their wives and children had been murdered, and their habitations con&s;umed by fire, were en|raged almo&s;t to madne&s;s. They proceeded im|mediately to the fort, and attacked it mo&s;t furi|ou&s;ly; the natives defending it with equal re&s;o|lution. The powder magazins at length took
<PB N="151" REF="030274_1439_0FE579EB214FE888">
fire, the fort was blown up, and, with it, almo&s;t every man that was in it. Various rencounters and a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inations &s;ucceeded this event; till, at length, two of the leaders being &s;lain, and ano|ther (fir&s;t di&s;patching his wife and children) hav|ing put a period to his own exi&s;tence, peace was again e&s;tabli&s;hed. From that period, no parti|cular di&s;turbances happened till 1740, when a few Ru&s;&s;ians were &s;lain in a tumult, but no far|ther con&s;equences en&s;ued; and every thing has &s;ince gone on very peaceably, excepting the in&s;ur|rection at Bolceret&s;k, which has been already mentioned.</P>
<P>Though a great many of the inhabitants were lo&s;t, in quelling the rebellion of 1731, the country had afterwards recovered it&s;elf, and was become as populous as ever in 1767; when the &s;mall-pox was, for the fir&s;t time, introduced among them, by a &s;oldier from Okot&s;k. It broke out with much fury, and was as dreadful in its progre&s;s as the plague; &s;eeming almo&s;t to threaten their en|tire extirpation. Twenty thou&s;and were &s;uppo&s;ed to have died by this filthy di&s;order in Kamt&s;chat|ka, the Kurile i&s;lands, and the Koreki country. The inhabitants of whole villages were &s;ometimes &s;wept away; of which &s;ufficient proof rem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ins. There are eight <HI>o&s;trogs</HI> about the bay of Awat&s;ka, which we were told had been completely inhabit|ed, but now they are all become de&s;olate, except St. Peter and St. Paul; and only &s;even Kamt&s;|chadales,
<PB N="152" REF="030274_1440_0FE5798691992850">
who are tributary, re&s;ide in that. At the <HI>o&s;trog</HI> of Paratounca, no more than thirty-&s;ix native inhabitants remain, including men, women, and children; though it contained three hundred and &s;ixty before it was vi&s;ited by the &s;mall-pox. We pa&s;&s;ed no le&s;s than four exten&s;ive <HI>o&s;trogs,</HI> in our journey to Bolcheret&s;k, which had not a &s;ingle in|habitant in either of them. The number of the natives is now &s;o much dimini&s;hed, and &s;o many Ru&s;&s;ians and Co&s;&s;acks are continually pouring in upon them, and intermixing with them by mar|riage, that, it is probable, very few of them will be left in le&s;s than half a century. We were in|formed by Major Behm, that tho&s;e who at this time pay tribute, do not exceed three thou&s;and, including the Kurile i&s;landers.</P>
<P>The number of military in the five forts of Nichnei, Verchnei, Tigil, Bolcheret&s;k, and St. Peter and St. Paul, are about four hundred, in|cluding Ru&s;&s;ians and Co&s;&s;acks. Nearly the &s;ame number are &s;aid to be at Ingiga; which, though in the north of the penin&s;ula, is under the com|mander of Kamt&s;chatka. The Ru&s;&s;ian traders and emigrants are not very con&s;iderable.</P>
<P>The government e&s;tabli&s;hed over this country by the Ru&s;&s;ians, con&s;idered as a military one, is remarkably mild and equitable. The natives are &s;uffered to elect their own magi&s;trates in their own mode, who exerci&s;e the &s;ame powers they have ever been accu&s;tomed to. One of the&s;e,

called a <HI>Toion,</HI> pre&s;ides over each <HI>o&s;trog,</HI> to whom all differences are referred; and who awards fines and puni&s;hments for all offences and mi&s;demea|nors; referring to the governor of Kamt&s;chatka, tho&s;e who are the mo&s;t intricate and enormous, not choo&s;ing to decide upon them him&s;elf. The <HI>Toion</HI> al&s;o appoints a civil officer under him, call|ed a corporal, who a&s;&s;i&s;ts him in his duty, and offi|ciates for him in his ab&s;ence.</P>
<P>An edict has been i&s;&s;ued by the empre&s;s of Ru&s;&s;ia, that no offence &s;hall be puni&s;hable with death. But we were told, that, in ca&s;es of murder (which rarely happens here) the <HI>knout</HI> is inflicted with &s;uch &s;everity, that the offender &s;eldom &s;ur|vives the puni&s;hment.</P>
<P>In &s;ome di&s;tricts, the only tribute that is ex|acted, is a fox's &s;kin; in others, a &s;able's; and, in the Kurile i&s;les, a &s;ea otter's; but, as the latter is con&s;iderably more valuable, the tribute of &s;everal per&s;ons is paid with a &s;ingle &s;kin. The tribute is collected by the <HI>Toions,</HI> in the different di&s;tricts, and is &s;o incon&s;iderable, as hardly to be con&s;ider|ed in any other light, than as an acknowledgment of the Ru&s;&s;ian dominion over them.</P>
<P>The Ru&s;&s;ians are not only to be commended for the mildne&s;s of their government, but are al&s;o entitled to applau&s;e for their &s;ucce&s;sful en|deavour in converting the natives to Chri&s;tianity; there being now but very few idolaters remaining among them. If we form a judgment of the

other mi&s;&s;ionaries, from the benevolent pa&s;tor of Paratounca, more &s;uitable per&s;ons could not po&s;|&s;ibly be engaged in this bu&s;ine&s;s. It may be ne|ce&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve, that the religion inculcated here, is that of the Greek Church. In many of the <HI>o&s;trogs,</HI> free-&s;chools are e&s;tabli&s;hed, for the in|&s;truction of the natives and Co&s;&s;acks in the Ru&s;|&s;ian language.</P>
<P>The articles exported from this country, con&s;i&s;t entirely of furs, and this bu&s;ine&s;s is principally conducted by a company of merchants, appointed by the empre&s;s. Twelve was the number of them originally, but three have &s;ince been added to them. Be&s;ides certain privileges allowed them, they are di&s;tingui&s;hed by wearing a gold medal, expre&s;&s;ive of the empre&s;s's protection of the fur trade. There are other inferior traders, chiefly Co&s;&s;acks, in different parts of the country. Whil&s;t the principal merchants remain here, they re&s;ide either at Bolcheret&s;k, or the Ni&s;hnei <HI>o&s;trog;</HI> the trade centering entirely in tho&s;e two places. This bu&s;ine&s;s was formerly carried on wholly in the way of barter, but every article is at pre&s;ent purcha&s;ed with ready money, no incon&s;iderable quantity of &s;pecie being circulated in that wretch|ed country. The furs produce a high price; and the natives, from their mode of life, require few articles in return. Our &s;ailors brought a quantity of furs from the coa&s;t of America, and were both plea&s;ed and a&s;toni&s;hed on receiving
<PB N="155" REF="030274_1443_0FE579ECA602BA68">
&s;uch a quantity of &s;ilver for them from the mer|chants; but as they could not purcha&s;e gin or to|bacco with it, or any thing el&s;e that would afford them any degree of entertainment, the roubles were &s;oon con&s;idered as trouble&s;ome companions, and they were frequently employed in kicking them about the deck. Our men received thirty roubles of a merchant, for a &s;ea-otter's &s;kin, and in the &s;ame proportion for others; but, under|&s;tanding they had great quantities to di&s;po&s;e of, and perceiving that they were unacquainted with traffic, he afterwards procured them at a much cheaper rate.</P>
<P>European articles are the principal that are im|ported, but they are not &s;olely confined to Ru&s;&s;ian manufactures. They come from England, Hol|land, Siberia, Bucharia, the Calmucks, and China. They chiefly con&s;i&s;t of coar&s;e woollen and linen cloths, &s;tockings, bonnets, and gloves; thin Per|&s;ian &s;ilks, pieces of nankeen, cottons, hanker|chiefs, both of &s;ilk and cotton; iron &s;toves, bra&s;s and copper pans, files, guns, powder and &s;hot; hatchets, knives, looking-gla&s;&s;es, &s;ugar, flour, boots, &amp;c. We &s;aw many of the&s;e articles in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of one of the merchants, who came from Okot&s;k in the empre&s;s's galliot. The&s;e commo|dities, we ob&s;erved, &s;old for three times the &s;um- they might have been purcha&s;ed for in England. And, notwith&s;tanding the merchants have &s;o ex|travagant a profit upon the&s;e imported goods,
<PB N="156" REF="030274_1444_0FE57A090932EF48">
they receive &s;till a greater advantage from the &s;ale of the furs at Kiachta, a con&s;iderable market for them on the frontiers of China. In Kamt&s;|chatka, the be&s;t &s;ea-otter &s;kins u&s;ually produce about thirty roubles a-piece; at Kiachta, the Chine&s;e merchant gives more than double that price, and di&s;po&s;es of them again at Pekin, for a much greater &s;um; after which, an aditional profit is made of many of them at Japan. If, then, the original value of a &s;kin at Kamt&s;chatka is thirty roubles, and it is afterwards tra&s;ported to Okot&s;k, thence by land thirteen hundred and &s;ixty-four miles to Kiachta, thence &s;even hundred and &s;ixty miles to Pekin, and after that to be tran&s;ported to Japan, what a lucrative trade might be e&s;tabli&s;hed between Kamt&s;chatka and Japan, which is not above three weeks &s;ail from it, at the utmo&s;t?</P>
<P>Furs of all kinds, exported from Kamt&s;chatka acro&s;s the &s;ea of Okot&s;k, pay ten <HI>per cent.</HI> duty, and &s;ables twelve. And merchandi&s;e of all de|nominations, imported from Okot&s;k, pay a duty of half a rouble for every pood, which is thirty-&s;ix Fngli&s;h pounds.</P>
<P>The export and import duties are paid at Okot&s;k; but the tribute which is collected at Bolcheret&s;k, amounts to the annual &s;um of ten thou&s;and roubles, as we were informed by Major Behm.</P>

large&s;t. But here they met with &s;o warm a re|ception, for attempting to compel the payment of a tribute, that they never ventured &s;o far again. The three groups before-mentioned, however, were made tributary. The whole &s;ea between Kamt&s;chatka and America is, according to the Ru&s;&s;ian charts, covered with i&s;lands; for, as tho&s;e who were engaged in the&s;e expeditions, frequently fell in with land, which they &s;uppo&s;ed did not tally with the &s;ituation laid down by preceding adventurers, they immediately &s;uppo&s;ed it to be a new di&s;covery, and reported it accordingly on their return; and, as the&s;e ve&s;&s;els were u&s;ually out three or four years, and &s;ometimes longer, &s;uch mi&s;takes could not immediately be rectified. It is pretty certain, however, that only tho&s;e i&s;lands which have been enumerated, have been di&s;|covered in that &s;ea, by the Ru&s;&s;ians, &s;outh of 6&deg; latitude.</P>

To extend this trade, an expedition was fitted out by the admi|ralty of Okot&s;k, to make di&s;coveries to the north and north-ea&s;t of the above mentioned i&s;lands, and the command of it given to Lieutenant Synd.

<P>The per&s;ons of the natives having already been de&s;cribed, we &s;hall only add, that, in their &s;tature, they are below the common height, which Major Behm attributes to their marrying &s;o very early; both &s;exes u&s;ually engage in the conjugal &s;tate, at thirteen or fourteen years of age. They are ex|ceedingly indu&s;trious, and may he properly con|tra&s;ted with the Ru&s;&s;ians and Co&s;&s;acks, who fre|quently intermarry with them, apparently for no other rea&s;on, but that they may be &s;upported in lazine&s;s and &s;loth. To this inactivity, may be at|tributed tho&s;e &s;corbutic complaints, which mo&s;t of them are dreadfully afflicted with; whil&s;t the natives, who exerci&s;e in the open air, entirely e&s;cape them.</P>
<P>Their habitations con&s;i&s;t of three di&s;tinct &s;orts; their <HI>jourts, balagons,</HI> and <HI>log-hou&s;es,</HI> which are

here called i&s;bas; they inhabit the fir&s;t in the winter, and the &s;econd in the &s;ummer; the third are introduced by the Ru&s;&s;ians, wherein only the wealthier people re&s;ide. The <HI>jourts</HI> are thus con|&s;tructed. A kind of oblong &s;quare is dug about &s;ix feet deep in the earth; the dimen&s;ions mu&s;t be proportioned to the numbers who are to inha|bit it, for it is u&s;ual for &s;everal to live together in the &s;ame <HI>jourt.</HI> Strong wooden po&s;ts, or pil|lars, are fa&s;tened in the ground, at equal di&s;|tances from each other, on which the beams in|tended to &s;upport the roof, are extended; which is formed by joi&s;ts, one end of which re&s;t upon the ground, and the other on the beams. Be|tween the joi&s;ts, the inte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;tices are filled up with wicker work, and turf is &s;pread over the whole. The external appearance of a <HI>jourt,</HI> re&s;embles a round &s;quat hillock. A hole, &s;erving for a chim|ney, window, and door, is left in the center, and the inhabitants go in and out by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a long pole, having notches deep enough to af|ford a little &s;ecurity for the toe. On the &s;ide, and even with the ground, there is another entrance, appropriated to the u&s;e of the women; but if a man pa&s;&s;es in or out of this door, he becomes as much an object of ridicule, as a &s;ailor who de|&s;cends through lubber's hole.</P>
<P>A <HI>jourt</HI> con&s;i&s;ts of one apartment, forming an oblong &s;quare. Broad platforms, made of boards are extended along the &s;ides, at the height of

about &s;ix inches from the ground; which &s;erve them for &s;itting on, and on which they repo&s;ed; fir&s;t taking care to cover them with mats and &s;kins.

<P>To erect a <HI>balagan,</HI> nine po&s;ts are fixed into the earth, in three regular rows, at equal di&s;|tances from each other, to the height of about twelve or thirteen feet from the &s;urface. About ten feet from the ground, rafters are laid from po&s;t to po&s;t, and &s;ecurely fa&s;tened by &s;trong ropes. The joi&s;ts are laid upon the&s;e rafters, and a turf covering completes the platform or floor of the balagan. A roof of a conical figure is rai&s;ed upon this, by means of long poles, which are fa&s;tened to the rafters at one end, and meet together in a point at the top. The whole is covered, or ra|ther thatched, with a coar&s;e kind of gra&s;s. The&s;e &s;ummer habitations have two doors, placed directly oppo&s;ite to each other, to which they a&s;cend by the &s;ame kind of ladders that are u&s;ed

in the <HI>jourts.</HI> In the lower parts, which is left entirely open, they dry their fi&s;h, vegetables, and other articles intended for the con&s;umption of the winter. Though &s;ix families u&s;ually live to|gether in one jourt, a <HI>balagan</HI> is &s;eldom occu|pied by more than one at a time.</P>
<P>The <HI>i&s;bas,</HI> or log-hou&s;es, are thus erected: Long timbers are piled horizontally, with the ends let into each other, and the &s;eams are filled up or caulked with mo&s;s. Like tho&s;e of our common cottages, the roof is &s;looping, and thatched either with gra&s;s or ru&s;hes. Each log-hou&s;e has three apartments in the in&s;ide. One end may be &s;aid to be a kind of entry, which extends the whole width and height of the hou&s;e, and &s;eems to be a kind of receptacle for their bulky articles, as &s;ledges, harne&s;s, &amp;c. This has a communication with their be&s;t apartment, which is in the middle, and is furni&s;hed with broad benches, calculated both for eating and &s;leeping upon. A door leads from this into the kitchen, almo&s;t half of which is taken up with an oven, or fire-place; which is let into the wall that &s;epa|rates the middle apartment and the kitchen, and is &s;o con&s;tructed as to communicate the heat to both rooms at the &s;ame time. There are two lofts over the kitchen and middle apartment, to which the inhabitants a&s;cend by a ladder placed in the entry for that purpo&s;e. Each apartment has two &s;mall windows made of <HI>talc,</HI> and, among

<P>The dre&s;s of the Kamt&s;chadale women having already been de&s;cribed, we &s;hall proceed to that of the men. The upper garment re&s;embles that of a waggoner's frock. If for &s;ummer wear, it is made of nankeen; if intended for winter, it is made of a &s;kin, (generally that of a deer or dog) having one &s;ide tanned, and the hair pre|&s;erved on the other, which is worn innermo&s;t. A clo&s;e jacket of nankeen, or &s;ome other cotton &s;tuff, is the next under this; and beneath that, a &s;hirt made of a thin Per&s;ian &s;ilk, of a red, blue, or yellow colour.

They have a fur cap, having two flaps that are u&s;ually tied up clo&s;e to the head, but are permitted to fall round the &s;houlders in bad weather.</P>
<P>The fur dre&s;s, which was pre&s;ented by Major Behm's &s;on to Captain King, is one of tho&s;e worn on ceremonious occa&s;ions by the <HI>Toions.</HI> It is &s;haped like the exterior garment we have ju&s;t de&s;cribed, and con&s;i&s;ts of &s;mall triangular pieces of fur, chequered brown and white, and &s;o ingeniou&s;ly joined as to appear to be of the &s;ame &s;kin. A border, of the breadth of &s;ix inches, curiou&s;ly wrought with different coloured threads of lerther, &s;urrounds the bottom, and produces a rich effect. A broad edging of the &s;ea otter's &s;kin is &s;u&s;pended to this. The &s;leeves are ornamented with the &s;ame materials. An edging of it al&s;o encircles the neck, and &s;urrounds the opening at the brea&s;t. It is lined with a beautiful white &s;kin.

The Ru&s;&s;ians who re&s;ide in Kamt&s;chatka, wear the European dre&s;s; and the uniform worn by the troops here, is of a dark green turned up with red.

<P>The Kuriles are a chain of i&s;lands, extending from latitude 51&deg; to 45&deg;, running from the &s;outhern promontory of Kamt&s;chatka to Japan, in a &s;outh-we&s;t direction. The inhabitants of the neighbourhood of Lopatka, who were them|&s;elves called Kuriles, gave the&s;e i&s;lands the &s;ame name, as &s;oon as they became acquainted with them. Spanberg &s;ays they are twenty-two in number, exclu&s;ive of the very &s;mall ones. The northernmo&s;t i&s;land, which is called Shoom&s;ka, is about three leagues di&s;tant from the promon|tory Lopatka, its inhabitants con&s;i&s;ting of a mix|ture of natives and Kamt&s;chadales.

The Ru&s;&s;ians paid their fir&s;t vi&s;it to the&s;e two i&s;lands in 1713, and added it to the domi|nions of the Empre&s;s.

And perhaps the time is not far di&s;tant, when all advantageous commerce will be carried on between Kamt&s;chatka and this exten&s;ive chain of i&s;lands, which may afterwards produce a communication with Japan it&s;elf. This intercour&s;e may probably be facilitated by a cir|cum&s;tance which Major Behm related, that &s;eve|ral Ru&s;&s;ians, having been taught the Japane&s;e language, by two natives of that country, who had been &s;hipwrecked on the coa&s;t of Kampt|&s;chatka, had been &s;ent among tho&s;e i&s;lands. The advantages that mu&s;t infallibly accrue to the Ru&s;&s;ians, by e&s;tabli&s;hing a commerce, with the Japane&s;e have been already adverted to, and are &s;ufficiently obvious.</P>
<P>The Koreki country con&s;i&s;ts of two di&s;tinct nations, which are called the wandering and fixed Koriacs. Part of the i&s;thmus of Kamt&s;chtka is inhabited by the former, as well as all the coa&s;t of the Ea&s;tern Ocean, from thence to the Anadir. The nation of the wandering Koriacs extends we&s;twards towards the river Kovyma, and along the north-ea&s;t of the &s;ea of Okot&s;k, as far as the river Pen&s;kina.</P>
<P>The re&s;emblance between the fixed Koriacs and the Kamt&s;chadales, is very &s;triking; both countries too depend alike on fi&s;hing for &s;ub&s;i&s;t|ence.
<PB N="168" REF="030274_1457_0FE57A1083AFD518">
Their clothing and habitations are equally &s;imilar. The fixed Koriacs are under the di&s;trict of the Ingiga, and are tributary to Ru&s;&s;ia.</P>
<P>The wandering Koriacs are wholly employed in breeding and pa&s;turing deer, and are &s;aid to have immen&s;e numbers in their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; it being common for a &s;ingle chief to have a herd of four or five thou&s;and. Deer is the food they &s;ub&s;i&s;t upon, and have an aver&s;ion to every kind of fi&s;h. They erect no <HI>balagans;</HI> their only ha|bitations being &s;omewhat like the Kamt&s;chadale <HI>jourts,</HI> except that, in winter, they are covered with raw deer-&s;kins; and, in &s;ummer, with &s;uch as have been tanned. Their &s;ledges are drawn only by deer, and tho&s;e which are u&s;ed in drawing them feed in the &s;ame pa&s;ture with the others. If they are wanted, the herd&s;man makes u&s;e of a certain cry which is familiar to them, which they obey quitting the herd immediately. The two nations of the Koriacs, (as we were in|formed by the prie&s;t of Paratounca) and the T&s;chut&s;ki, make u&s;e of different dialects of the &s;ame language; but it has not the &s;malle&s;t affi|nity to that of the Kamt&s;chadale.</P>
<P>The country inhabited by the T&s;chut&s;ki, is bounded by the Anadir on the &s;outh, and ex|tends to the T&s;chut&s;koi No&s;s. Their attention, like that of the wandering Koriacs, confined chiefly to their deer, with which their country
<PB N="169" REF="030274_1458_0FE57A4473E6A6D0">
abounds. They are a courageous, well-made, warlike race of people; and are formidable neigh|bours to the Koriacs of both nations who often experience their depredations. The Ru&s;&s;ians have long endeavoured to bring them under their do|minion; and though they have lo&s;t a great num|ber of men in their different expeditions to; ac|compli&s;h this purpo&s;e, they have never yet been able to effect it.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>AS the Lords of the Admiralty, in the in|&s;tructions which they had given for the re|gulation of the pre&s;ent voyage, had entru&s;ted the
<PB N="171" REF="030274_1460_0FE548E7D5592620">
commanding officer of the expedition with a di&s;|cretionary power, in ca&s;e of not &s;ucceeding in the di&s;covery of a pa&s;&s;age from the Pacific Ocean into the Atlantic, to make choice, in his return to England, of whatever route he &s;hould judge be&s;t adapted for the improvement of geography; Cap|tain Gore de&s;ired, that the principal officers would deliver their &s;entiments, in writing, relative to the mode in which the&s;e in&s;tructions might mo&s;t effectually be carried into execution. The re&s;ult of their opinions, which, to his great &s;atisfaction, he found unanimous, and perfectly agreeing with his own, was, that the condition of our ve&s;|&s;els, of the &s;ails, cordage, &amp;c. rendered it ha|zardous and un&s;afe to make any attempt, as the winter was now approaching, to navigate the &s;ea between A&s;ia and Japan, which would otherwi&s;e have opened to us the mo&s;t copious field for di&s;|covery: that it was therefore mo&s;t prudent to &s;teer to the ea&s;tward of that i&s;land; and, in our way thither, to &s;ail along Kuriles, and exa|mine, in a mo&s;t particular manner, tho&s;e i&s;lands that are &s;ituated neare&s;t to the northern coa&s;t of Japan, which are &s;aid to be of con&s;iderable ex|tent, and not &s;ubject to the Ru&s;&s;ians or Japane&s;e. Should we have the good fortune to meet with &s;ome &s;ecure and commodious harbours in any of the&s;e i&s;lands, we &s;uppo&s;ed they might prove of con&s;iderable importance, as convenient places of &s;helter for &s;ub&s;equent navigators, who might be
<PB N="172" REF="030274_1461_0FE57A12B7737EE0">
employed in exploring the &s;eas, or as the means of producing a commercial intercour&s;e among the adjacent dominions of the two above-menti|oned empires. Our next object was to take a &s;urvey of the coa&s;ts of the Japane&s;e i&s;les; after which we de&s;igned to make the coa&s;t of China as far to the north as was in our power, and pro|ceed along it to Macao.</P>
<P>This plan of operations being adopted, Cap|tain King was ordered by Captain Gore, in ca&s;e the two &s;hips &s;hould &s;eparate, to repair without delay to Macao; and on the 9th of October, about &s;ix o'clock in the afternoon, having cleared the entrance of the bay of Awat&s;ka, we made &s;ail to the &s;outh-ea&s;tward, the wind blowing from the north-we&s;t and by we&s;t. A perfect calm en|&s;ued at midnight, and continued till the noon of the following day; at which time the light-hou&s;e was at the di&s;tance of fourteen or fifteen miles, bearing north half we&s;t; and Cape Gavareea bore &s;outh by we&s;t half we&s;t. Our pre&s;ent depth of water being &s;ixty and &s;eventy fathoms, our peo|ple were very profitably engaged in catching cod, which were extremely fine, and in great abun|dance. A breeze &s;pringing up from the we&s;t about three o'clock in the afternoon, we &s;teered to the &s;outh along the coa&s;t.</P>
<P>A head-land now opened with Cape Gavareea, in the direction of &s;outh by we&s;t, &s;ituated about twenty-one miles beyond it. Betwixt them are
<PB N="173" REF="030274_1462_0FE579B5F5E3F1B8">
two narrow, though deep inlets, which may per|haps unite behind what has the appearance of an elevated i&s;land. The coa&s;ts of the&s;e inlets are rather &s;teep and cliffy. The hills, which break with abruptne&s;s, form cha&s;ms and vallies, that are plentifully furni&s;hed with wood.</P>
<P>Between Awat&s;ka Bay, and Cape Gavareea, which lies in the longitude of 158&deg; 38&prime;, and in the latitude of 52&deg; 21&prime;, there appear to be &s;everal inlets, which may, at fir&s;t &s;ight, flatter the navi|gator with hopes of procuring &s;helter and good anchorage: but we were a&s;&s;ured by the Ru&s;&s;ian pilots, that there are none that will admit ve&s;&s;els even of the &s;malle&s;t &s;ize, as the &s;paces which &s;eem vacant, between the lofty projecting head-lands, are filled up with low land.</P>
<P>We again, had a calm towards the evening: but, about midnight, a light breeze &s;prung up from the north, which gradually augmented to a &s;trong gale. On monday the 11th, at noon, we were in the latitude of 52&deg; 4&prime;, and in the longitude of 158&deg; 31&prime;; Cape Gavareea bearing north by we&s;t a quarter we&s;t, and the &s;outhern extremity &s;outh-we&s;t half we&s;t. We were now at the di&s;|tance of nine or ten miles from the neare&s;t part of the coa&s;t&punc; and perceived the whole inland coun|try covered with &s;now. A point of land towards the &s;outh, which we judged to be in the latitude of 51&deg; 54&prime;, con&s;tituted the northern &s;ide of a deep bay, di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of Achachin&s;koi,
<PB N="174" REF="030274_1463_0FE579C399008728">
in who&s;e di&s;tant bottom we imagined that a large river di&s;charged it&s;elf, as the land behind ap|peared remarkably low. To the &s;outhward of Achachin&s;koi Bay, the land did not exhibit &s;uch a rugged and barren a&s;pect, as was ob&s;ervable in that part of the country which we had before pa&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>We had variable winds during the night, ac|companied with rain; but, the next morning, at four o'clock, the wind began to blow with &s;uch violence from the north-ea&s;t quarter, that we were obliged to double-reef the top-&s;ails, and thought proper to &s;tand to a greater di&s;tance from the &s;hore. About &s;ix o'clock, the weather be|came more moderate and fair; in con&s;equence of which we again &s;tood in for the land. Our lati|tude, at twelve, was 51&deg;, and our longitude 157&deg; 25&prime;. The mo&s;t northerly land in view, being the point which we have already mentioned as fir&s;t opening with Cape Gavareea, was in the direc|tion of north-north-ea&s;t. A head-land, having a flat &s;ummit, which is &s;ituated in the latitude of 51&deg; 27&prime;, and forms the &s;outhern point of an inlet, named Girowara, bore north a quarter ea&s;t, and the mo&s;t &s;outherly land in &s;ight was about eight|teen miles di&s;tant, bearing we&s;t three quarters north. We could, at this time, faintly perceive low land extending from the &s;outhern extremity; but as the wind &s;hifted to the north-we&s;t, we were unable to obtain a nearer view of it.</P>
<P><PB N="175" REF="030274_1464_0FE579C582F15778">At &s;ix o'clock in the afternoon, we di&s;cerned, from the ma&s;t-head, Cape Lopatka, which is the mo&s;t &s;outhern extreme of Kamt&s;chatka. This cape, which is very low and flat, and gradually &s;lopes from the elevated level land that we had &s;ight of at noon, bore we&s;t half north, at the di&s;|tance of fifteen or &s;ixteen miles; and the high land, at the &s;ame time, bore north-we&s;t by we&s;t half we&s;t. This point of land forming &s;o di&s;tin|gui&s;hed an object in the geography of the ea&s;tern coa&s;t of A&s;ia, we were glad of an opportunity of a&s;certaining, by accurate ob&s;ervations, its exact po&s;ition, which is in the longitude of 156&deg; 45&prime;, and in the latitude of 51&deg;. We perceived, to the north-we&s;t of it, a very lofty mountain, who&s;e &s;ummit was lo&s;t in the clouds. At the &s;ame in|&s;tant, the fir&s;t of the Kurile i&s;lands, named Shoom|&s;ka, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">de its appearance, in the direction of we&s;t half &s;outh.</P>
<P>The pa&s;&s;age between Shoom&s;ka and Cape Lo|patka, is repre&s;ented by the Ru&s;&s;ians as being one league in breadth, and extremely dangerous, as well on account of the rapidity of the tides, as of the &s;unken rocks which lie off the Cape. The coa&s;t, from Cape Gavareea to Lopatka, trends to the &s;outh-ea&s;tward. The land, to the &s;outh of Achachin&s;koi, is not &s;o elevated and broken as betwixt that bay and the entrance of the bay of Awat&s;ka, being only of a moderate height towards the &s;ea, with hills ri&s;ing gradually
<PB N="176" REF="030274_1465_0FE579F4924B6538">
further inland. The coa&s;t is of con&s;iderable &s;teep|ne&s;s, and abounds with white chalky patches.</P>
<P>Having a calm at noon, we had an opportu|nity of catching &s;ome excellent cod. Our depth of water, at this time, was forty fathoms; and our di&s;tance from Cape Lopatka was between five and &s;ix leagues. During the night we &s;tood to the &s;outh-&s;outh-we&s;t under an ea&s;y &s;ail, with a we&s;terly wind. We &s;ounded at midnight, and found our&s;elves in &s;ixty fathoms water.</P>
<P>On the 13th, at break of day, we de&s;cried the &s;econd of the Kurile I&s;lands, named Paramou&s;ir by the Ru&s;&s;ians, extending from we&s;t half &s;outh to north-we&s;t by we&s;t. This land was exceed|ingly high, and almo&s;t wholly covered with &s;now. At twelve o'clock, its extremes bore from we&s;t-north-we&s;t half we&s;t, to north-north-we&s;t half we&s;t; and a lofty peaked mountain, from which &s;ome of our people imagined they beheld &s;moke i&s;&s;uing, was at the di&s;tance of twelve or thirteen leagues bearing north-we&s;t by we&s;t half we&s;t. Our latitude, at this time, was 49&deg; 49&prime; and our longitude 157&deg;. We ob&s;erved in the cour&s;e of the day, &s;everal whales, and a con&s;iderable num|ber of albatro&s;&s;es and gulls.</P>
<P>The i&s;land of Paramou&s;ir is the large&s;t of the Kuriles that are &s;ubject to the dominion of the Ru&s;&s;ians; and is worthy of a more accurate &s;ur|vey, than we were, on this occa&s;ion, enabled to take. For, in the afternoon, the we&s;terly wind
<PB N="177" REF="030274_1466_0FE579704CD51860">
increa&s;ing to a bri&s;k gale, it was not in our power to make a nearer approach to it than we had made at noon; we were, therefore, obliged to content our&s;elves with endeavouring to determine its po&s;ition at that di&s;tance. The &s;outhern ex|treme of the i&s;land &s;tands, according to our com|putation, in the latitude of 49&deg; 58&prime;; the northern extremity we place in the latitude of 50&deg; 46&prime;, and in the longitude of 10&prime; we&s;t of Cape Lo|patka; and as this &s;ituation does not metarially differ from that which the Ru&s;&s;ians have a&s;&s;ign|ed, it is in all probability, very near the truth.</P>
<P>While we were abrea&s;t of Paramou&s;ir, we had a very violent &s;well from the north-ea&s;t-ward, though the wind had continued, for &s;ome time, in the we&s;tern quarter; a circum&s;tance which more than once occurred to our ob&s;ervation dur|ing the cour&s;e of the voyage. In the night we &s;ounded, but did not reach the bottom with fifty fathoms of line. The two following days, the wind blowing fre&s;h from the we&s;t, obliged us to &s;teer to the &s;outhward, and con&s;equently pre|vented us from &s;eeing any more of the Kuriles.</P>
<P>On Saturday the 16th, at noon, our latitude was 45&deg; 27&prime;; our longitude, deduced from many lunar ob&s;ervations taken during the three preced|ing days, was 155&deg; 30&prime; and the variation was 4&deg; 30&prime; ea&s;t. In this &s;ituation, we were almo&s;t encompa&s;&s;ed by the real or pretended di&s;coveries of prior navigators, and could not readily deter|mine
<PB N="178" REF="030274_1467_0FE579B77A3A1508">
to which we &s;hould direct our cour&s;e. To|wards the &s;outh and the &s;outh-we&s;t, a group con|&s;i&s;ting of five i&s;lands, named Kuna&s;hir, Zellany, and the Three Si&s;ters, were placed in the French charts. According to the &s;ame charts, we were now about ten leagues to the we&s;t of De Gama's Land, which, in April la&s;t, we had pa&s;&s;ed to the ea&s;tward, at a di&s;tance &s;omewhat le&s;s than the pre&s;ent, without ob&s;erving the lea&s;t appearance of it; from which circum&s;tance it may rea&s;onably be inferred, that, if &s;uch land has any exi&s;tence, it mu&s;t be an i&s;land of very &s;mall extent.

<P>With re&s;pect to the famous land of Je&s;o, which has, for &s;o long a time, proved a &s;tumbling-block to modern geographers, it may be ob&s;erved, that it was fir&s;t brought to the knowledge of Euro|peans by the Ca&s;tricom and Bre&s;kes. The name, from the earlie&s;t accounts, appears to have been
<PB N="179" REF="030274_1468_0FE57A2AD2744DE0">
well known to the Kamt&s;chadales and Japane&s;e, and indi&s;criminately u&s;ed by them for all the i&s;lands that are &s;ituate between Japan and Kamt&s;|chatka. It has been &s;ince affixed to an exten&s;ive imaginary i&s;land, or continent, pretended to have been di&s;covered by the two Dutch &s;hips above-mentioned; and, therefore, it may not perhaps, be deemed improper to take the grounds of this error into our con&s;ideration. The expedition, in which tho&s;e ve&s;&s;els were engaged, was under|taken with a view of exploring the ea&s;tern coa&s;t of Tartary; but, a &s;torm &s;eparating the two &s;hips, off the &s;outh-ea&s;t point of Japan, they &s;ail|ed along the e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;tern &s;ide of that i&s;land in different tracks; and, pa&s;&s;ing its northern extreme, pro|ceeding &s;ingly on their voyage. De Vries, com|mander of the Ca&s;tricom, &s;teering a northerly cour&s;e, fell in with land on the third day, in the 42d degree of latitude. He &s;ailed (according to the journal of the expedition) along the &s;outh-ea&s;tern coa&s;t, in a continual fog, for the &s;pace of about &s;ixty leagues; and having brought his &s;hip to anchor in &s;everal places, had a friendly com|munication with the natives. Now, as the i&s;lands of Zellany, Kuna&s;hir, and Matimai, appear, from the di&s;coveries of Captain Spanberg, to &s;tand ex|actly in this &s;ituation, it is more than probable that they are the &s;ame land; and the error of De Vries, in &s;uppo&s;ing them to be one continent &s;eems to be &s;ufficiently accounted for from this

circum&s;tance of the fog, without our adopting the &s;uppo&s;ition of an earthquake, by which Mr. Muller, de&s;irous of reconciling the general opi|nion with the later di&s;coveries of the Ru&s;&s;ians, imagines the &s;everal parts to have been &s;eperated. The journal afterwards mentions the di&s;covery of Staten I&s;land and the company's Land re&s;pecting which we have already declared our &s;entiments. When they had pa&s;&s;ed through the Straits of De Vries, (continues the journal) they entered an exten&s;ive, wild, and tempe&s;tuous &s;ea, in which they proceeded, with dark mi&s;ty weather, to the 48th degree of northern latitude; after which being driven to the &s;outh by adver&s;e winds, they again fell in with land, towards the we&s;t, in the latitude of 45&deg;, which they &s;till &s;uppo&s;ed was a part of the continent of Je&s;o; whereas, if any per&s;on will examine Jan&s;en's map of their di&s;co|veries, which appears to be very accurate, he will not, we think, entertain a doubt of their being, at this time, on the coa&s;t of Tartary. After they had traced this land four degrees to the northward, they returned towards the &s;outh through the &s;ame &s;tarits they had before pa&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>But, to return to the narrative of our voyage; the having veered, in the afternoon of the 16th, to the northward, we hauled round to the we&s;t. In th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> cour&s;e of this day we ob&s;erved &s;everal albitro&s;&s;es, fulmars, and numerous flocks of birds, we al&s;o &s;aw a number of fi&s;h, which were

In the evening, being vi&s;ited by a &s;mall land bird, about the &s;ize of a gold-finch, and not unlike that bird in plumage and &s;hape, we thought proper to keep a careful look out for land. However, upon our trying for &s;oundings at midnight, we did not &s;trike ground with forty-five fathoms of line.</P>
<P>The next day, at noon, our longitude was 154&deg;, and our latitude 45&deg; 7&prime;. The wind again becoming we&s;terly, we were under the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;teering a more &s;outherly cour&s;e; and, about midnight, we had a fre&s;h gale from the &s;ame quarter, attended with heavy rain.

from us; and, about the &s;ame time, the wind &s;hifting to the &s;outhward, we were enabled to &s;teer for it. At two o'clock, we &s;et &s;tudding-&s;ails, and &s;tood to the we&s;tward; but, the wind augmenting to a gale, we were quickly obliged to double-reef the top-&s;ails; and, at midnight, we deemed it nece&s;&s;ary to examine our depth of water. We accordingly &s;ounded; but, meeting with no ground at the depth of &s;eventy-five fathoms, we again bore away to the we&s;t, with the wind in the &s;outh-ea&s;t point.</P>
<P>This cour&s;e we continued till two in the morn|ing of the 19th, when the weather becoming thick and gloomy, we hauled our wind, and &s;tood to the &s;outh-we&s;tward till five o'clock, at which time a violent &s;torm reduced us to our cour&s;ers. Though, from the unfavourable &s;tate of the weather, there was but little probability of our making the land, our attention was &s;till anxiou&s;ly directed to this object; and, on the appearance of day-light, we ventured to &s;teer we&s;t by &s;outh. We proceeded on the &s;ame cour&s;e till ten o'clock in the forenoon, when the wind &s;uddenly veered round to the &s;outh-we&s;t, and was accompanied with clear weather.

continuing any longer on this tack: we therefore put about, and &s;tood towards the &s;outh.</P>
<P>Our latitude, at this time, was 44&deg; 12&prime;, and our longitude 150&deg; 40&prime;; &s;o that, after all our exertions, we had the mortification of finding our&s;elves, according to the Ru&s;&s;ian charts, upon the &s;ame meridian with Nadeeg&s;da, which they repre&s;ent as the mo&s;t &s;outherly of all the Kurile I&s;lands, and about &s;ixty miles to the &s;outhward.</P>
<P>Though the violent and adver&s;e winds that we had met with for the la&s;t &s;ix days, had de|prived us of an opportunity of getting in with the&s;e i&s;lands, yet the cour&s;e on which we had been obliged to proceed, did not prove alto|gether de&s;titute of geographical advantages. For the groupe of i&s;lands, comprehending Zellany, Kuna&s;hir, and the Three Si&s;ters, which, in the maps of Mon&s;ieur D'Anville, are laid down in the track we had ju&s;t cro&s;&s;ed, are, by this means, demon&s;trably removed from that po&s;ition; and thus an additional proof is obtained of their being &s;ituated to the we&s;t, where Captain Span|berg has placed them, between the longi|tudes of 142&deg; and 147&deg;. But this &s;pace being occupied, in the French charts, by Staten I&s;land, and part of the land of Je&s;o, the opinion of Muller becomes highly probable, that they are all the &s;ame lands; and, as we have no rea&s;on to call in que&s;tion the accuracy of Spanberg, we have, in our general map, re-in&s;tated Kuna&s;hir
<PB N="184" REF="030274_1473_0FE579A4D259FB98">
Zellany, and the Three Si&s;ters, in their proper &s;ituation, and have totally omitted the re&s;t.</P>
<P>When we reflect on the manner in which the Ru&s;&s;ians have multiplied the I&s;lands of the Nor|thern Archipelago, not only from the want of accuracy in a&s;certaining their real po&s;ition, but likewi&s;e from the de&s;ire natural to mankind of propagating new di&s;coveries, we &s;hall not be &s;ur|prized that the &s;ame cau&s;es &s;hould produce &s;imilar effects. It is thus that the lands of Je&s;o, which appear, as well from the earlie&s;t traditions among the Ru&s;&s;ians, as from the accounts of the Ja|pane&s;e, to be no other than the &s;outhern Kurile I&s;lands, have been imagined to be di&s;tinct from the latter. De Gama's land is next on record; and this was originally repre&s;ented as being nearly in the &s;ame &s;ituation with tho&s;e we have ju&s;t mentioned; but it was afterwards removed, in order to make room for Staten I&s;land and the Company's Land; and, as Je&s;o, and the mo&s;t &s;outherly of the Kuriles, and likewi&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this &s;pace, that nothing might be lo&s;t, the former had a place provided for it to the we&s;tward, and the letter towards the ea&s;t.</P>
<P>As according to the Ru&s;&s;ian charts, the i&s;les of Kuna&s;hir and Zellany, were &s;till to the &s;outh, we entertained &s;ome hopes of being able to make them, and, with this view, kept our head to|wards the we&s;t as much as the wind would per|mit. At twelve o'clock, on the 20th, our lati|tude
<PB N="185" REF="030274_1474_0FE5794DD05D83A0">
was 43&deg; 47&prime;, and our longitude 150&deg; 30&prime;; and we were then &s;tanding to the we&s;t by &s;outh, with a gentle breeze from the &s;outh-ea&s;t, and, &s;oon after, were, in all probability, not more than four and twenty leagues to the ea&s;t of Zellany; but this good fortune was not of long duration: for, about three in the afternoon, the wind &s;hifting to the north-we&s;t point, began to blow with &s;uch violence, that we were brought under our mizen &s;tay-&s;ail and fore-&s;ail.</P>
<P>For the next twenty-four hours, we had heavy rain and vehement &s;qualls; after which, the weather becoming moderate, and the horizon being in &s;ome mea&s;ure clear we were enabled to &s;et our top-&s;ails; but as the wind continued to blow from the north we&s;t, all out attempts to make the land were rendered abortive, and we were at length obliged to relinqui&s;h all further thoughts of di&s;covery to the northward of Japan. To this di&s;appointment we &s;ubmitted with the greater reluctance, as our curio&s;ity had been con|&s;iderably excited by the accounts that are given of the natives of the&s;e i&s;lands.</P>
<P>An accident befel the Re&s;olution in the after|noon of the 21&s;t; for the leach-rope of her fore-top-&s;ail gave way, and &s;plit the &s;ail. As this had frequently happened during the life of Captain Cook, he had, on &s;uch occa&s;ions, ordered the foot and leach-ropes of the top-&s;ails to be taken out, and larger ones to be fixed in their room;

and the&s;e likewi&s;e proving incapable of &s;upport|ing the &s;train that was on them, it manife&s;tly appears, that the ju&s;t proportion of &s;trength be|tween the &s;ail and tho&s;e ropes is extremely mi&s;|calculated in our &s;ervice.</P>
<P>This day a land-bird, &s;omewhat larger than a &s;parrow, but greatly re&s;embling one in other re&s;pects, perched on our rigging, and was caught. The gale now gradually abated; &s;o that, on Fri|day the 22d, in the morning, we let out the reefs of our top-&s;ails, and carried more &s;ail. Our latitude, at twelve o'clock, was 40&deg; 58&prime;. and our longitude 148&deg; 17&prime;; the variation 3&deg; ea&s;t.</P>
<P>During the afternoon, another land-bird pitch|ed on one of our &s;hips, and was &s;o exhau&s;ted with fatigue, that it &s;uffered it&s;elf to be taken in|&s;tantaneou&s;ly, and expired a few hours after|wards. Its &s;ize did not exceed that of a wren; it had on its head a tuft of yellow feathers, and the re&s;t of its plumage was &s;imilar to that of a linnet. The bird that we mentioned before as bearing a great re&s;emblance to a &s;parrow, lived a long time after it was taken.</P>
<P>The&s;e birds afforded clear indications, that we were not at any very con&s;iderable di&s;tance from the land, and the wind, after varying for a little time, &s;ettling at the north point in the evening, our hopes of falling in with the land again revived, and we &s;teered to the we&s;t-north-we&s;t; in which direction were &s;ituated, at the

di&s;tance of about fifty leagues, the &s;outhernmo&s;t i&s;lands, &s;een by Captain Spanberg, and &s;aid to be inhabited by hairy men. The wind, however, did not keep pace with our wi&s;hes, but blew in &s;uch light airs, that we made little progre&s;s, till about eight o'clock the following morning, when a fre&s;h breeze &s;prung up from the &s;outh-&s;outh-we&s;t, with which we continterd our cour&s;e to the we&s;t-north-we&s;t till the evening. The latitude, at noon, was 40&deg; 35&prime;; and the longitude deduced from &s;everal lunar ob&s;ervations, was 146&deg; 45&prime;. The variation of the needle was 17&prime; ea&s;t.</P>
<P>In the evening, we had violent &s;qually gales, accompanied with rain; and, as we had, in the cour&s;e of this day, pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome patches of green gra&s;s, and ob&s;erved a number of &s;mall land birds, a &s;hag, and many flocks of gulls, we did not think it con&s;i&s;tent with prudence, having all the&s;e &s;igns of the vicinity of land, to &s;tand on for the whole night. We, therefore, about midnight, tacked, and for the &s;pace of a few hours, &s;teered to the &s;outh-ea&s;tward.</P>
<P>On the 24th, at four in the morning, we again bore away to the we&s;t-north-we&s;t, and carried a pre&s;s of &s;ail till about &s;even o'clock in the even|ing, when the wind veered round from &s;outh-&s;outh-we&s;t to the north, and blew a fre&s;h gale.

<P>The wind, during the night, &s;hifted to the north-ea&s;t, and blew a bri&s;k gale; and, at the &s;ame time, we had heavy rain, and hazy weather. On the 25th, at noon, we were in the latitude of 49&deg; 18&prime;, and in the longitude of 144&deg;. Flights, of wild ducks were this day ob&s;erved by us; a pigeon lighted upon our rigging; and many birds, re&s;embling linnets, flew about the &s;hips, with a degree of vigour, that gave us rea&s;on to imagine they had not been long on the wing. We al&s;o pa&s;&s;ed a piece either of bamboo or &s;ugar|cane, and &s;everal patches of long gra&s;s.

<P><PB N="189" REF="030274_1478_0FE57B422F33DCC0">On Tuesday the 26th at break of day, we had the &s;atisfaction of perceiving high land towards the we&s;t, which proved to be Japan. At eight o'clock, it was at the di&s;tance of ten or twelve miles, and extended from &s;outh by we&s;t to north-we&s;t. A low flat cape, which apparently con&s;ti|tuted the &s;outhern part of the entrance of a bay, bore north-we&s;t three quarters we&s;t. Near the &s;outh extremity, a hill of a conic figure appeared, bearing &s;outh by we&s;t three quarters we&s;t.

<P>Having &s;tood on till nine o'clock, we had by that time approached within five or &s;ix miles of the land, which bore we&s;t three quarters &s;outh. Our depth of water was fifty-eight fathoms, with a bottom compo&s;ed of very fine &s;and. We now tacked, and &s;tood off; but, as the wind failed us, we had proceeded, at noon, to no greater di&s;|tance from the &s;hore than three leagues. This part of the coa&s;t extended from north-we&s;t by north to &s;outh half ea&s;t, and was principally bold and cliffy. The low cape above-mentioned was about &s;ix leagues di&s;tant, bearing north-we&s;t by we&s;t; and the northern point of the inlet was in the direction of &s;outh three quarters we&s;t. Our

latitude, by ob&s;ervation, was 40&deg; 5&prime;, and our longitude 142&deg; 28&prime;.

We have, therefore, thought proper to adopt wherever we could nearly a&s;certain the identity of the &s;ituations, the names affixed in Jan&s;en's map, to the corre&s;ponding head-lands and points, ob&s;erved by us along the coa&s;t.</NOTE>.

The northern point of the inlet, was imagined by us to be Cape Nambu; and we conjectured, that the town <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Jan&s;en calls the town Nabo.</NOTE> &s;tood in a break or the high land, towards which the inlet apparently directed it&s;elf. The neighbouring country is of a moderate elevation, and has a double range of mountains. It is well furni&s;hed with wood, and exhibits a plea&s;ing variety of hills and dales. We perceived the &s;moke ari&s;ing from &s;everal villages or towns, and &s;aw many hou&s;es in delightful and cultivated &s;ituations, at a &s;mall di&s;tance from the &s;hore.</P>
<P>While the calm continued, that we might lo&s;e no time, we put our fi&s;hing-lines overboard, in ten fathoms water, but met with no &s;ucce&s;s.

This being the only diver&s;ion which our pre&s;ent circum&s;tances permitted us to enjoy, we very &s;en&s;ibly felt the di&s;appointment; and looked back with regret to the cod-banks of the di&s;mal regions we had lately quitted, which had furni&s;hed us with &s;o many &s;alutary meals, and, by the amu&s;e|ment they afforded, had given a variety to the tedious recurrence of the &s;ame nautical and a&s;tro|nomical ob&s;ervations, and the weari&s;ome &s;ucce&s;|&s;ion of calms and gales.</P>
<P>At two o'clock in the afternoon, the wind blow fre&s;h from the &s;outh, and, by four, had re|duced us to clo&s;e reefed top&s;ails, and obliged us to &s;tand off to the &s;outh-ea&s;tward; in con&s;equence of which cour&s;e, and the gloomine&s;s of the wea|ther, we &s;oon lo&s;t &s;ight of land. We kept on during the whole night, and till eight o'clock the following morning, when the wind &s;hifting to the north, and becoming moderate, we made, &s;ail, and &s;teered a we&s;t-&s;outh-we&s;t cour&s;e, towards the land, which, however, we did not make before three in the afternoon; at which time it was &s;een to extend from north-we&s;t half we&s;t to we&s;t. The mo&s;t northerly extremity was a continuation of the elevated land, which was the &s;outhernmo&s;t we had ob&s;erved the preceding day. The land to the we&s;tward, we conjectured to be the <HI>Ho&s;e Tafel Berg</HI> (or High Table Hill) of Jan&s;en. The coa&s;t, betwixt the two extremes, was low, and
<PB N="192" REF="030274_1481_0FE5E9FC8CDC30C8">
could &s;carcely be perceived, except from the ma&s;t-head.</P>
<P>We proceeded towards the coa&s;t till eight in the evening, when our di&s;tance from it was about five leagues; and having &s;hortened &s;ail for the night, we &s;teered in a &s;outherly direction, &s;ound|ing every four hours; but our depth of water was &s;o great, that we did not find ground with a hundred and &s;ixty fathoms of line.</P>
<P>We again &s;aw land on the 28th, about &s;ix o'clock in the morning. It lay twelve leagues to the &s;outhward of that which we had &s;een the day before, and extended from we&s;t by north to we&s;t-&s;outh-we&s;t. Steering &s;outh-we&s;t obliquely with the &s;hore, we &s;aw, at ten o'clock, more land in that direction. To the we&s;t of this land, which is low and level, were two i&s;lands, as we &s;uppo&s;ed, though &s;ome doubts were entertained, whether they were not united with the neigh|bouring low ground. The hazine&s;s of the wea|ther, as well as our di&s;tance, rendered it likewi&s;e impo&s;&s;ible for us to a&s;certain, whether there were not &s;ome inlets or harbours between the project|ing points, which here &s;eemed to promi&s;e tolera|ble &s;helter.</P>
<P>At noon, the northern extremity of the land in view bore north-we&s;t by north, and a lofty peaked hill, over a &s;teep head-land, was fifteen or &s;ixteen miles di&s;tance, bearing we&s;t by north. Our pre&s;ent latitude, by ob&s;ervation, was 30&deg; 16&prime;
<PB N="193" REF="030274_1482_0FE57AA75DDDEF60">
and our longitude 142&deg; 9&prime;. The mean of the variation was found to be 1&deg; 20&prime; ea&s;t.</P>
<P>The land di&s;appeared from our view between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, and, from its breaking off &s;o &s;uddenly, we imagined, that what we had this day &s;een was an i&s;land, or, perhaps, a group of i&s;land, &s;ituated off the main land of Japan; but, as the i&s;lands called by D'Anville Mat&s;ima, and by Jan&s;en the Schildpads, though repre&s;ented as being nearly in the &s;ame &s;ituation, are unequal in extent to the land &s;een by us, we mu&s;t leave this point undetermined.</P>
<P>We continued our cour&s;e to the &s;outh-we&s;t during the remainder of the day, and, at mid|night, found our depth of water to be &s;eventy fathoms, over a bottom of fine brown &s;and. We therefore hauled up towards the ea&s;t, till the next morning, when we again had &s;ight of land, about eleven leagues to the &s;outh of that which we had &s;een the preceeding day. At eight o'clock, we were within the di&s;tance of about two leagues from the &s;hore, having had regular &s;oundings from &s;ixty-five to twenty fathoms over gravel and coar&s;e &s;and.</P>
<P>It unfortunately happened, that there was a haze over the land, which prevented us from di&s;|tingui&s;hing &s;mall objects on it. The coa&s;t was &s;traight and unbroken, running nearly in the di|rection of north and &s;outh. The ground was low towards the &s;ea, but gradually &s;welled into
<PB N="194" REF="030274_1483_0FE57AC500159F28">
hills of a moderate elevation, who&s;e &s;ummits were pretty even, and covered with wood.</P>
<P>About nine o'clock, the &s;ky being in &s;ome de|gree overca&s;t, and the wind veering to the &s;outh, we tacked, and &s;tood off to the ea&s;tward. Not long after, we ob&s;erved a ve&s;&s;el, clo&s;e in with the land, &s;tanding to the north along the &s;hore; and we al&s;o &s;aw another in the offing, coming down on us before the wind. The reader will ea&s;ily conceive, that objects of any kind, belong|ing to a country &s;o celebrated, and yet &s;o imper|fectly known, mu&s;t have excited a general eager|ne&s;s of curio&s;ity; in con&s;equence of which, every per&s;on on board came in&s;tantaneou&s;ly upon deck, to gaze at them. As the ve&s;&s;el to windward ap|proached us, &s;he hauled off to a greater di&s;tance from the &s;hore; upon which, being apprehen&s;ive of alarming tho&s;e who were on board of her by the appearance of a pur&s;uit, we brought our &s;hips too, and &s;he &s;ailed a-head of us, at the di&s;tance of four or five furlongs. We might have &s;poken to them with great facility; but Captain Gore, perceiving, by their manoeuvres, that they were highly terrified, was unwilling to increa&s;e their apprehen&s;ions; and, imagining that we &s;hould have many better opportunities of communica|tion with the Japane&s;e, &s;uffered them to retire without interruption.</P>
<P>We were not &s;ufficiently near this ve&s;&s;el, to remark any particulars re&s;pecting the men on
<PB N="195" REF="030274_1484_0FE57B3402D284D8">
board of her, who &s;eemed to be &s;ix or &s;even in number, e&s;pecially as the u&s;e of our gla&s;&s;es was precluded by the thickne&s;s of the weather. Ac|cording to the mo&s;t probable conjectures we were enabled to form, the ve&s;&s;el was of the burthen of about forty tons. She had only one ma&s;t, on which was hoi&s;ted a quadrangular &s;ail, extended aloft by a yard, the braces of which worked for|wards. Three pieces of black cloth came half|way down the &s;ail, at an equal di&s;tance from each other. The ve&s;&s;el was lower in the middle than at each end; and from her figure and appearance, we &s;uppo&s;ed, that &s;he could not &s;ail otherwi&s;e than large.</P>
<P>The wind blew fre&s;h at noon, and was accom|panied with much rain. By three in the after|noon, it had increa&s;ed in &s;o great a degree, that we were reduced to our cour&s;es. The &s;ea, at the &s;ame time, ran as high as any of our people ever remembered to have &s;een it.</P>
<P>If the ve&s;&s;els of the Japane&s;e are, as Koempfer has de&s;cribed them, open in the &s;tern, it would have been impo&s;&s;ible for tho&s;e which we &s;aw, to have endured the violence of this &s;torm; but, as the appearance of the weather, during all the former part of the day, had progno&s;ticated its approach, and one of the &s;loops had, neverthe|le&s;s, &s;tood a con&s;iderable way out to &s;ea, it may &s;afely be inferred, that they are very capable of &s;u&s;taining the fury of a gale of wind. Spanberg

has, indeed, mentioned two &s;orts of Japane&s;e ve&s;&s;els; one corre&s;ponding with Koempfer's de|&s;cription, while the other, which he denominates bu&s;&s;es, and in which, he &s;ays, the natives make voyages to the adjacent i&s;lands, perfectly agrees with tho&s;e that were &s;een by us.</P>
<P>About eight o'clock in the evening, the gale, without the &s;malle&s;t diminution of its violence, &s;hifted to the we&s;t, and, by producing a &s;udden &s;well, in a direction contrary to that which had before prevailed, cau&s;ed our &s;hips to &s;train and labour extremely. During the continuance of the &s;torm, the Re&s;olution had &s;everal of her &s;ails &s;plit. They had, indeed, been bent for &s;uch a con&s;iderable time, and were worn &s;o thin, that this accident had lately happened in both our ve&s;|&s;els almo&s;t daily; particularly when the &s;ails were &s;tiff and heavy with rain, in which ca&s;e they be|came le&s;s capable of bearing the &s;hocks of the boi&s;terous and variable winds we occa&s;ionally ex|perienced.</P>
<P>The gale at length abating, and &s;ettling in the we&s;tern quarter, we &s;teered a &s;outhward cour&s;e; and on Saturday the 30th, at nine o'clock in the morning, we &s;aw the land, extending from we&s;t by north to north-we&s;t a quarter we&s;t, at the di&s;tance of fifteen or &s;ixteen leagues. It &s;hewed it&s;elf in detached parts; but we were not near enough to a&s;certain, whether they were &s;mall i&s;lands, or parts of Japan.</P>
<P><PB N="197" REF="030274_1486_0FE57AFCEE7F4648">At noon, the land extended from we&s;t to north-we&s;t; and the neare&s;t part of it was twelve or thirteen leagues di&s;tant, beyond which, the coa&s;t appeared to run in a we&s;tern direction. Our pre&s;ent latitude, by ob&s;ervation, was 36&deg; 41&prime;, and our longitude 142&deg; 6&prime;. The point to the north, which we imagined was near the &s;outhern|mo&s;t land &s;een the preceding day, was &s;uppo&s;ed by us to be Cape de Kennis; and the break to the &s;outh of this point, was thought to be the mouth of the river, on which the town named Gi&s;&s;ima is &s;aid to &s;tand. The next cape is, in all probability, that which is called Boomtje's Point in the Dutch charts; and the mo&s;t &s;outh|erly one, off which we were abrea&s;t at noon, we conjectured to be near Low Point (termed by Jan&s;en <HI>Lage Hoeck,</HI> and placed by him in the latitude of 36&deg; 40&deg;), and that our di&s;tance was too great to admit of our &s;eeing the low land, in which it probably terminates, toward the ea&s;t.</P>
<P>The wind, in the afternoon, &s;hifting to the north-ea&s;t, we &s;tood to the &s;outh, at the di&s;tance of &s;eventeen or eighteen leagues from the coa&s;t. As we pa&s;&s;ed along, we tried for &s;oundings, but did not find any ground with a hundred and fifty fathoms of line.</P>
<P>On the 31&s;t, at two o'clock in the morning, the wind veered round to the we&s;t, and blew in violent &s;qualls, accompanied with lightning and rain. In the cour&s;e of this day, &s;everal little
<PB N="198" REF="030274_1487_0FE57AE9867D7408">
birds of a brown plumage, re&s;embling linnets, which had been driven off the land by the &s;trong we&s;terly gales, flew about our &s;hips. On the approach of evening, the wind coming to the north-we&s;t point, we directed our cour&s;e, with the birds, to the we&s;t &s;outh-we&s;t, with a view of re|gaining the coa&s;t.</P>
<P>The next morning, which was the 1&s;t of No|vember, the wind &s;hifted to the &s;outh-ea&s;t, and was attended with fair weather; in con&s;equence of which, we obtained, with four different qua|drants, forty-two &s;ets of di&s;tances of the moon from the &s;un and &s;tars, each &s;et comprehending &s;ix ob&s;ervations. The&s;e nearly coinciding with each other, fix, with great accuracy, our &s;itua|tion, at twelve o'clock this day, in the longitude of 141&deg; 32&prime;; the latitude, by ob&s;ervation, being 35&deg; 17&prime;. In our reckonings of the 31&s;t of Octo|ber, we found an error, with re&s;pect to latitude, of eight miles, and of &s;eventeen in this day's computations; from which circum&s;tance, as well as from our being much more to the ea&s;t than we expected, we inferred, that there had been a vio|lent current from the &s;outh we&s;tward.</P>
<P>We again made the land towards the we&s;t, at two o'clock in the afternoon, at the di&s;tance of twelve or thirteen leagues. The mo&s;t &s;outherly land in view, which we imagined was White Point (or <HI>Witte Hoeck,</HI> placed by Jan&s;en in the latitude of 35&deg; 42&prime;), bore we&s;t-&s;outh-we&s;t half

we&s;t. A hummock to the northward, which had an in&s;ular appearance, bore north-north-we&s;t half we&s;t; and within this we di&s;cerned from the m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;t-head &s;ome low land, which we &s;uppo&s;ed to be Sanddown Point, called <HI>Sanduynege Hoeck</HI> by Jan&s;en, who has placed it in the latitude of 35&deg; 55&prime;</P>
<P>We &s;teered for the land till between five and &s;ix, when we hauled our wind to the &s;outh. We ob&s;erved, at this time, many Japane&s;e ve&s;&s;els, clo&s;e in with the land, &s;ome &s;tanding along the &s;hore, and others apparently occupied in fi&s;hing. We now de&s;cried to the we&s;tward a mountain of extraordinary height, with a round &s;ummit, ri&s;ing far inland. There is no high ground in the neigh|bourhood of it, the coa&s;t being of a moderate elevation, and, as far as the hazine&s;s of the hori|zon permitted us to judge, much broken and indented by &s;mall inlets. But, to the &s;outh of the hummock i&s;land above-mentioned, there ap|peared, at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance up the, coun|try, a ridge of hills, which extended towards the mountain, and might perhaps join with it.</P>
<P>This being the mo&s;t remarkable hill &s;een by us near the coa&s;t, we were de&s;irous of a&s;certaining its preci&s;e &s;ituation; but as we had only gained this &s;ingle view of it, we were obliged to content our&s;elves with &s;uch accuracy as our circum&s;tances would admit of. Its latitude we judged to be 35&deg; 20&prime;, and is longitude 140&deg; 26&prime;&punc; the latter

being e&s;timated by its di&s;tance from our &s;hips, at this time fifteen leagues.</P>
<P>As the coa&s;t of Japan, is repre&s;ented, in the Dutch charts, as extending nine or ten leagues to the &s;outh-we&s;t of White Point, we tacked at eight o'clock in the evening, and &s;tood off to the ea&s;tward, with a view of weathering that point. We again tacked, at midnight, to the &s;outh-we&s;t|ward, under the expectation of falling in with the coa&s;t to the &s;outh, but were &s;urprized, at eight the next morning, to &s;ee the hummock at no greater di&s;tance than three leagues, in the di|rection of we&s;t-north-we&s;t. We were, at fir&s;t, almo&s;t inclined to doubt the evidence of our &s;en&s;es, and afterwards began to &s;u&s;pect &s;ome de|ception from a re&s;emblance of land; but, at noon, we found, by ob&s;ervation, that we were actually in the latitude of 35&deg; 43&prime;, at a time when, according to our reckonings, it was 34&deg; 48&prime;. It therefore appeared, that during the eight hours in which we imagined we had proceeded nine leagues to the &s;outh-we&s;tward, we had really been carried eight leagues from the &s;ituation we left, in a totally oppo&s;ite direction; which occa&s;ioned, upon the whole, a difference of &s;eventeen leagues in our computation, in that incon&s;iderable &s;pace of time. From this error, we e&s;timated, that the current had &s;et, at the rate of at lea&s;t five knots an hour, to the north-ea&s;t by north. Our pre&s;ent longitude was 141&deg; 16&prime;</P>
<P><PB N="201" REF="030274_1490_0FE57AEB708C6010">As the weather had now a very threatening ap|pearance, and the wind was at &s;ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h-&s;outh-ea&s;t, we thought it advi&s;eable to quit the neighbour|hood of the &s;hore, and &s;tand off towards the ea&s;t, that the &s;hips might not be entangled with the land. We were not deceived in our progno&s;tica|tions; for, not long afterwards, a heavy gale be|gan to blow which continued till the &s;ucceeding day, and was attended with rainy and hazy wea|ther.</P>
<P>On Wedne&s;day the 3d, in the morning, we found our&s;elves, by our reckoning, at the di&s;tance of upwards of fifty leagues from the coa&s;t; which circum&s;tance, united to the con&s;ideratian of the very uncommon effect of currents we had already experienced, the advanced period of the year, the variable and uncertain &s;tate of the weather, and the &s;mall pro&s;pect we had of any alteration for the better, induced Captain Gore to form the re&s;olution of leaving Japan, and pro&s;ecuting our voyage to China; particularly as he entertained <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, that, &s;ince the track he intended to pur&s;ue had not yet been, explored, he might perhaps find an opportunity of making amends, by &s;ome new and important di&s;covery, for the di&s;appointments we had &s;u&s;tained upon this coa&s;t.</P>
<P>If any of our readers &s;hould be inclined to &s;up|po&s;e that we relingui&s;hed this object too ha&s;tily, it may be ob&s;erved, in addition to the facts before &s;tated, that the coa&s;t of Japan, according to
<PB N="202" REF="030274_1491_0FE57A6BCDFC6220">
Koempfer's de&s;cription of it, is the mo&s;t dange|rous in all the known world <NOTE PLACE="foot">Koempfer's Hi&s;tory of Japan, vol. i. p. 92, 93, 94, and 102.</NOTE>; that it would have been exceedingly hazardous, in ca&s;e of di&s;tre&s;s, to have run into any of the harbours of that country; where, if we may credit the mo&s;t au|thentic writers, the aver&s;ion of the natives to a communication with &s;trangers, has prompted them to the commi&s;&s;ion of the mo&s;t flagrant acts of barbarity; that our ve&s;&s;els were in a leaky con|dition; that the rigging was &s;o rotten as to require continual repairs; and that the &s;ails were almo&s;t entirely worn out, and incapable of with&s;tanding the vehemence of a gale of wind.</P>
<P>As the violent currents, which &s;et along the ea&s;tern &s;hore of Japan, may perhaps be attended with dangerous con&s;equences to tho&s;e navigators, who are not acquainted with their extreme rapi|dity, we will here &s;ubjoin a &s;ummary account of their direction and force, as remarked by us from the 1&s;t day of November to the 8th of the &s;ame month. On the 1&s;t, at a time when we were about eighteen leagues to the ea&s;t of White Point, the current &s;et, at the rate of three miles in an hour, to the north-ea&s;t and by north. On the 2d, as we made a nearer approach to the &s;hore, we ob&s;erved that it continued in a &s;imilar direc|tion, but was augmented in its rapidity to five miles an hour. As we receded from the coa&s;t,
<PB N="203" REF="030274_1492_0FE57A740A164A68">
it again became more moderate, and inclined towards the ea&s;t. On the 3d, at the di&s;tance of &s;ixty leagues from the &s;hore, it &s;et, at the rate of three miles an hour, to the ea&s;t-north-ea&s;t. On the two following days, it turned to the &s;outh|ward, and, at a hundred and twenty leagues from the coa&s;t, its direction was &s;outh-ea&s;t, and its rate did not exceed one mile and a half in an hour. It again, on the 6th and 7th, &s;hifted to the north-ea&s;t, and its force dimini&s;hed gradually till the 8th, at which time we could no longer perceive any current.</P>
<P>We proceeded to the &s;outh-ea&s;tward during the 4th and 5th of November, with very un&s;ettled weather, and much lightning and rain. On each of tho&s;e days we pa&s;&s;ed con&s;iderable quantities of pumice-&s;tone, &s;ome pieces of which were taken up by our people, and found to weigh from an ounce to three pounds. We imagined that the&s;e &s;tones had been thrown into the water, by eruptions at different periods, as many of them were entirely bare, and others covered with barnaeles. At the &s;ame time, we had a number of porpoi&s;es playing round our &s;hips; and &s;aw &s;everal &s;mall land-birds, and two wild ducks.</P>
<P>At break of day, on Saturday the 6th, we changed our cour&s;e to the &s;outh-&s;outh-we&s;t; but, about eight o'clock in the evening, we were taken back, and obliged to &s;tand towards the &s;outh-ea&s;t. The next day, at noon, we &s;aw a

<P>On the 9th, we had a great &s;well from the ea&s;t-&s;outh-ea&s;t; and our longitude was 146&deg; 20&prime;, and latitude 31&deg; 46&prime;. In the cour&s;e of this day, we ob&s;erved another little land-bird, a tropic bird, &s;ome flying-fi&s;h and porpoi&s;es.

<P>We continued to pa&s;s much pumice-&s;tone; the amazing quantities of which &s;ub&s;tance, floating in the &s;ea betwixt Japan and the Ba&s;hee I&s;les, give rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e, that in this, quarter of the Pacific Ocean, &s;ome great volcanic convul&s;ion mu&s;t have happened; and, con&s;equently, afford &s;ome degree of probability to the opinion of Mr. Muller, (which we have mentioned in a former part of this chapter) relative to the &s;eparation of the continent of Je&s;o, and the di&s;appearance of Staten I&s;land, and the Company's Land.</P>
<P>About &s;ix o'clock in the afternoon, we &s;teered to the we&s;t-&s;outh-we&s;t, Captain Gore deeming it u&s;ele&s;s to &s;tand any longer towards the &s;outh-&s;outh-we&s;t, as we were nearly in the &s;ame meri|dian with the Ladrones, or Marianne I&s;lands, and at no very con&s;iderable di&s;tance from the track of the Manilla galleons.</P>
<P>In the morning of Saturday the 14th, we had fine weather, and the wind, which blew mode|rately, &s;hifted by degrees to the north-ea&s;t point, and proved to be the trade-wind. At ten o'clock Mr. Trevenen, one of the young gentlemen who accompanied Captain King in the Di&s;covery, after the death of Captain Clerke, &s;aw land in the direction of &s;outh-we&s;t, which had the appear|ance

of a peaked mountain. At noon, the lon|gitude was 142&deg; 2&prime;, and the latitude 24&deg; 37&prime;.</P>
<P>The land in view, which we now di&s;covered to be an i&s;land, was nine or ten leagues di&s;tant, bearing &s;outh-we&s;t half we&s;t; and, at two o'clock in the afternoon, we de&s;cried another to the we&s;t-north-we&s;tward. This &s;econd i&s;land, when viewed at a di&s;tance, appears like two; the &s;outhern point con&s;i&s;ting of a lofty hill of a conic figure, united by a narrow neck to the northern land, which is of a moderate elevation. This i&s;land being manife&s;tly of greater extent than that to the &s;outhward, we directed our cour&s;e towards it. At four o'clock, it bore north-we&s;t by we&s;t; but, as we had not &s;ufficient day-light to examine its coa&s;t, we &s;tood, during the night, upon our tacks.</P>
<P>The next morning, at &s;ix, we made &s;ail for the &s;outhern point of the larger i&s;land; and, about this time, di&s;covered another high i&s;land, in the direction of north three quarters we&s;t; the i&s;land to the &s;outhward being on the &s;ame rhomb line, and the &s;outh extreme of the i&s;land a-head bear|ing we&s;t by north. At nine o'clock, we were abrea&s;t of the middle i&s;land, and within the di&s;|tance of a mile from it; but Captain Gore, find|ing that a boat could not land without running &s;ome ri&s;que from the heavy &s;urf that broke again&s;t the &s;hore, continued his cour&s;e to the we&s;tward.
<PB N="107" REF="030274_1496_0FE57A8E6DA02148">
The latitude at noon, by ob&s;ervation, was 24&deg; 50&prime;, and the longitude 140&deg; 56&prime;</P>
<P>The length of this i&s;land, in the direction of &s;outh-&s;outh-we&s;t and north-north-ea&s;t, is about five miles. Its &s;outh point is an elevated barren hill&punc; rather &s;lat at the &s;ummit, and when &s;een from the we&s;t-&s;outh-we&s;t, exhibits an evident volcanic crater.

The Re&s;olution having pa&s;&s;ed nearer the land, &s;everal of the officers of that &s;hip thought they di&s;cerned &s;teams proceeding from the top of the hill.

<P>Captain Gore now thought proper to direct his cour&s;e to the we&s;t-&s;outh-we&s;t, for the Ba&s;hee I&s;les, with the hopes of procuring, at them, &s;uch a &s;upply of refre&s;hments as might render it le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary to continue long at Macao, The&s;e i&s;lands received a vi&s;it from Captain Dampier, who has given a very favourable account, as well of the civility of the natives, as of the abun|dance of hogs and vegetables, with which the country is furni&s;hed.

and, during the night, we proceeded under an ea&s;y &s;ail; &s;o that it was &s;carcely po&s;&s;ible to avoid ob|&s;erving any land that lay in the vicinity of our cour&s;e. In this manner we continued our pro|gre&s;s, without any intere&s;ting occurrence, having a fre&s;h breeze from the north ea&s;t, till Monday the 22d, when it augmented to a &s;trong gale, with vehement &s;qualls of wind and rain, which re|duced us to clo&s;e-reefed top-&s;ails.</P>
<P>The following day, at twelve o'clock, our latitude, by account, was 21&deg; 5&prime;, and our longi|tude 123&deg; 20&prime;.

<P>Our pre&s;ent &s;ituation, with re&s;pect to longi|tude, being to the we&s;t of the Ba&s;hee I&s;les, ac|cording to Mr. Dalrymple's charts, we perceived that Captain Gore was influenced, in the cour&s;e he was now &s;teering, by the &s;entiments of Com|modore Byron and Captain Wallis, with whom he had &s;ailed when they pa&s;&s;ed the&s;e i&s;lands, which are placed by the former near four degrees to the we&s;tward, or in the longitude of 118&deg; 14&prime;. In con&s;equence of this opinion, we &s;tood towards the &s;outh at two o'clock in the afternoon, with an intention of getting into the &s;ame parallel of latitude with the Ba&s;hees, before we &s;hould r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n
<PB N="211" REF="030274_1500_0FE57A45FB3F1570">
down our longitude. We had nearly arrived in that &s;ituation by &s;ix o'clock, and ought, in con|&s;equence, to have been within &s;ight of the land, according to the account of Captain Wallis, who places the&s;e i&s;lands near three degrees more to the ea&s;t than Commodore Byron.</P>
<P>The fury of the gale had not, at this time, received the lea&s;t diminution; and Captain Gore, being &s;till of opinion that the Ba&s;hees were &s;ituated to the we&s;tward, brought the &s;hips too, with their heads turned towards the north-we&s;t, under the fore-&s;ail and balanced mizen.</P>
<P>On the 26th, about &s;ix in the morning, the wind having, in a great mea&s;ure, abated, we &s;et our top-&s;ails, let out the reefs, and bore away to the we&s;tward. At twelve o'clock, our latitude, by ob&s;ervation, was 21&deg; 12&prime;, and our longitude 120&deg; 25&prime;. In the cour&s;e of this day, we &s;aw many tropic birds, and a flock of ducks; al&s;o porpoi&s;es and dolphins; and continued to pa&s;s &s;everal pumice-&s;tones. We &s;pent the night on our tacks; and the following morning, at &s;ix o'clock, we again made &s;ail to the we&s;t, in &s;earch of the Ba&s;hee I&s;les.</P>
<P>Captain King began now to entertain appre|hen&s;ions, le&s;t, in the pro&s;ecution of our &s;earch for tho&s;e i&s;lands, we &s;hould get &s;o far to the &s;outh as to be under the nece&s;&s;ity of pa&s;&s;ing to leeward of the Pratas; in which ca&s;e, it might have proved extremely difficult for &s;uch bad-&s;ailing

ve&s;&s;els as ours to fetch Macao, e&s;pecially if the wind &s;hould continue to blow (as it now did) from the north-north-ea&s;t and north. The Cap|tain having &s;ome doubts whether Mr. Dalrymple's maps were on board the Re&s;olution, made &s;ail and hailed her; and having informed Captain Gore of the &s;ituation of the&s;e &s;hoals, and his ap|prehen&s;ions of being driven too much to the &s;outhward, the latter gave him to under&s;tand, that he &s;hould continue his cour&s;e during that day, being &s;till not without hopes of finding Mr. Byron's longitude right; and therefore ordered Captain King to &s;pread a few miles to the &s;outh.</P>
<P>The weather, at twelve o'clock, became hazy: the latitude, at that time, was 21&deg; 2&prime;, and the longitude 118&deg; 30&prime;. At &s;ix in the afternoon, having got to the we&s;t of the Ba&s;hee I&s;lands, ac|cording to Admiral Byron's account, Captain Gore hauled his wind to the north-we&s;tward, under an ea&s;y &s;ail, the wind blowing with great vehemence, and there being every pro&s;pect of a tempe&s;tuous night.</P>
<P>On the 28th, at four o'clock in the morning, the Re&s;olution, which was then a half a mile a-head of the Di&s;covery, wore, and the crew of the latter &s;hip at the &s;ame time, perceived breakers clo&s;e under their lee. On the approach of day-light, we had &s;ight of the i&s;land of Prata; and, be|tween the hours of &s;ix and &s;even, we &s;tood to|wards the &s;hoal, but finding our&s;elves unable to
<PB N="213" REF="030274_1502_0FE57A53F94D2C98">
weather it, we bore away, and ran to leeward. As we pa&s;&s;ed along the &s;outh &s;ide, within the di&s;|tance of a mile from the reef, we &s;aw two remark|able patches on the edge of the breakers, that had the appearance of wrecks.</P>
<P>At noon, the latitude di&s;covered by double altitudes, was 20&deg; 39&prime;; and the longitude was 116&deg; 45&prime;. The i&s;land of Prata was now three or four leagues di&s;tant, bearing north three quarters ea&s;t. Near the &s;outhern extremity of the i&s;land, and on the &s;outh-we&s;tern &s;ide of the reef, we ima|gined that we &s;aw, from the ma&s;t-head, &s;everal openings in the reef, which &s;eemed to promi&s;e &s;e|cure anchorage.</P>
<P>The extent of the Prata &s;hoal is con&s;iderable; for it is about &s;ix leagues from north to &s;outh, and extends three or four leagues to the ea&s;t of the i&s;land; its limits to the we&s;tward we had not an opportunity of a&s;certaining. We judge its north-ea&s;tern extremity to be in the latitude of 20&deg; 58&prime;, and the longitude of 117&deg;; and its &s;outh-we&s;t end we place in the latitude of 20&deg; 45&prime;, and the longitude of 116&deg; 44&prime;.</P>
<P>We carried a pre&s;s of &s;ail during the remainder of the day, and kept the wind, which now blew from the north-ea&s;t by north, in order to &s;ecure our pa&s;&s;age to Macao. It was a fortunate cir|cum&s;tance, that the wind favoured us towards the evening, by veering two points more to the ea&s;t|ward; for, if the wind and weather had continu|ed
<PB N="214" REF="030274_1503_0FE57A9ACE9CB518">
the &s;ame as they had been in the preceding week, we think we &s;hould &s;carcely have been able to have fetched that port, in which ca&s;e we mu&s;t have repaired to Batavia; a place we had good rea&s;on to dread, from the terrible havock which the unhealthine&s;s of the climate had occa|&s;ioned among the crews of the former ve&s;&s;els that had been employed in voyages of di&s;covery, and had touched there.</P>
<P>In the morning of Monday the 29th, we pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome Chine&s;e fi&s;hing-boats, the crews of which eyed us with marks of great indifference. In fi&s;hing, they make u&s;e of a large dredge-net, re|&s;embling a hollow cone in &s;hape, with a &s;tat iron rim fixed to the lower part of its mouth. The net is fa&s;tened with cords to the head and &s;tern of the boat, which being left to follow the impul&s;e of the wind, draws the net after it, with the iron rim dragging along the bottom. We found the &s;ea, to to our great regret, covered with the wrecks of boats which had been lo&s;t, as we &s;uppo&s;ed, in the late &s;tormy weather.</P>
<P>Our latitude at twelve o'clock, by ob&s;ervation, was 22&deg; 1&prime;; and, &s;ince the preceding noon, we had run a hundred and ten miles upon a north-we&s;t cour&s;e. As we were now nearly in the lati|tude of the Lema I&s;lands, we made &s;ail to the we&s;t by north, and, after we had proceeded two and twenty miles, de&s;cried one of them nine or ten leagues to the we&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="215" REF="030274_1504_0FE57A92AD00A140">At &s;ix in the afternoon, the extremes of the i&s;lands in view were in the direction of north-north-we&s;t, half we&s;t, and we&s;t-north-we&s;t half we&s;t; and we were four or five leagues di&s;tant from the neare&s;t; our &s;oundings being twenty-two fathoms, over a muddy bottom. We now &s;lackened &s;ail, and kept upon our tacks for the night. The Grand Lema, according to Mr. Bayly's time-keeper, bore, from the i&s;land of Prata, north 60&deg; we&s;t, a hundred and fifty-three miles; and, by our run, north 57&deg; we&s;t, a hun|dred and forty-&s;ix miles.</P>
<P>The next morning, we ran along the Lema I&s;les, which, like the other i&s;lands &s;ituated on this coa&s;t, are de&s;titute of wood, and, as far as we had an opportunity of ob&s;erving, devoid of cultivation. About nine o'clock, a Chine&s;e boat, which had before been with the Re&s;olution, came along-&s;ide the Di&s;covery, with offers of a pilot, which, however, Captain King declined, as it was incumbent upon him to follow his con&s;ort. Not long afterwards, we pa&s;&s;ed the we&s;ternmo&s;t of the Lema rocks; but, in&s;tead of hauling up to the north of the Grand Ladrone I&s;land, as was done by Lord An&s;on in the Centurion, we &s;ailed to leeward.</P>
<P>We &s;carcely think it nece&s;&s;ary to caution the navigator again&s;t taken this cour&s;e, as the dan|ger is &s;ufficiently manife&s;t; for, if the wind
<PB N="216" REF="030274_1505_0FE57AB106B7C9A0">
&s;hould blow violently, and the current &s;et with it, it will be highly difficult to fetch Macao. We might, indeed, by the direction of Mr. Dalrym|ple's chart, have &s;afely gone either between the Lema I&s;lands, or entirely to the northward of them, and have had the wind &s;avourable for our reaching Macao. From our apprehen&s;ions of mi&s;&s;ing that port, and being obliged to repair to Batavia, added to the &s;trong and ardent de|&s;ires of hearing intelligence from Europe, we were the more inclined to rejoice on ob&s;erving the Re&s;olution &s;oon after fire a gun, and di&s;play her colours as a &s;ignal, for a pilot. On the repe|tition of the &s;ignal, there was an excellent race between four Chine&s;e boats; and Captain Gore engaged with the per&s;on who arrived fir&s;t, to con|duct the &s;hip to the Typa, for the &s;um of thirty dollars, &s;ending word, at the &s;ame time, to Cap|tain King, that, as he could ea&s;ily follow him with the Di&s;covery, that expence might be &s;aved to him.</P>
<P>In a &s;hort time afterwards, a &s;econd pilot getting on board the Re&s;olution, in&s;i&s;ted on guiding the &s;hip; and immediately laying hold of the wheel, began to order the &s;ails to be trimmed. This gave ri&s;e to a violent altercation, which was at length compromi&s;ed, by their agreeing to divide the money between them.</P>
<P><PB N="217" REF="030274_1506_0FE57A47E257E2A8">At twelve o'clock, our latitude, by ob&s;erva|tion, was 21&deg; 57&prime; north, and our longitude 114&deg; 2&prime; ea&s;t. The Grand Ladrone i&s;land was, at this time, four miles di&s;tant, extending from north-we&s;t half north to north half we&s;t. The land, who&s;e bearings we have here mentioned, was &s;up|po&s;ed by us to be one i&s;land; but we afterwards found that the we&s;tern part was an i&s;land laid down in Mr. Dalrymple's chart of part of the Chi|ne&s;e coa&s;t, &amp;c. which we had not at pre&s;ent on board.</P>
<P>In pur&s;uance of the in&s;tructions which had been given to Captain Cook by the Lords of the Ad|miralty, it now became nece&s;&s;ary to de&s;ire the of|ficers and men to deliver up their journals, and all other papers they might have in their po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion, relative to the hi&s;tory of the voyage. Some degree of delicacy, as well as firmne&s;s, &s;eemed to be requi&s;ite in the execution of the&s;e orders. Our commanders could not be ignorant, that mo&s;t of the officers, and &s;everal of the &s;eamen, had amu&s;ed them&s;elves, in their lei&s;ure hours, with writing accounts of our proceedings, for the purpo&s;e of gratifying their friends, or for their own private &s;atisfaction; which they might not wi&s;h to have &s;ubmitted, in their pre&s;ent form, to the in&s;pection of &s;trangers. On the other hand, the Captains could not, con&s;i&s;tently with the in&s;tructions they had received, leave papers
<PB N="218" REF="030274_1507_0FE57AA59B706DE8">
in their cu&s;tody, which, either by accident or de|&s;ign, might fall into the hands of printers and thus give ri&s;e to &s;uch &s;purious and imperfect nar|ratives of our voyage, as might tend to the di&s;pa|ragement of our labours, and perhaps, to the pre|judice of officers, who might, though inju&s;tly, in|cur the &s;u&s;picion of having been the authors of &s;uch publications.</P>
<P>Captain King, therefore, a&s;&s;embled the Di&s;|covery's people on deck, and informed them of the orders that had been received, and the rea&s;ons which, in his opinion, ought to induce them to yield a perfect obedience. He, at the &s;ame time, gave them to under&s;tand, that whatever papers they wi&s;hed not to have &s;ent to the Lords of the Admiralty, &s;hould be &s;ealed up in their own pre|&s;ence and pre&s;erved in his cu&s;tody, till the inten|tions of their Lord&s;hips, re&s;pecting the publication of the hi&s;tory of the voyage, were accompli&s;hed; after which, he &s;aid, they &s;hould be faithfully re|&s;tored to them.</P>
<P>Captain King had the &s;atisfaction to find, that his propo&s;als met with the approbation, and the ready compliance, not only of the officers, but al&s;o of the re&s;t of the &s;hip's company; and every &s;crap of paper, that contained an account of any tran&s;actions relating to the pre&s;ent voyage, was immediately given up.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>WE continued working to windward till about &s;ix o'clock in the afternoon, when we let go our anchors, by the direction of the Chine&s;e pilot on board the Re&s;olution, who was
<PB N="221" REF="030274_1510_0FE57AE67B1E75E0">
of opinion, that the tide was now &s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ting again&s;t us. In this particular, however, he was greatly deceived; for, upon our making the experiment, we di&s;covered, that it &s;et towards the north till ten o'clock. The next morning&punc; (Wedne&s;day the 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t of December) he fell into an error of a &s;imilar kind; for, at five, on the appearance of &s;lack water, he directed that we &s;hould get under way; but the ignorance he had before manife&s;ted had put us upon our guard. We were therefore willing to be convinced, by our own ob&s;erva|tions, before we weighed anchor; and, on exa|mining the tide, we found a &s;trong under-tow, in con&s;equence of which we were obliged to keep fa&s;t till eleven o'clock. It appears from the&s;e circum&s;tances, that the tide had run down for the &s;pace of twelve hours.</P>
<P>We &s;tood on our tacks, during the afternoon, between the Grand Ladrone and the i&s;land of Potoe, having pa&s;&s;ed to the ea&s;t of the latter. The tide beginning to ebb at nine o'clock, we again ca&s;t anchor in &s;ix fathoms water; the town of Macao being at the di&s;tance of nine or ten miles, in a north-we&s;t direction; and the i&s;le of Potoe bearing &s;outh half we&s;t, &s;ix or &s;even miles di&s;tant.</P>
<P>Potoe is &s;ituated about two leagues to the north-north-we&s;t of that i&s;land, which, as we have already mentioned, we at fir&s;t con&s;idered as a part of the Grand Ladrone. It is rocky, and
<PB N="222" REF="030274_1511_0FE57B3592B60A00">
of &s;mall extent; and off its we&s;tern extremity there is &s;aid to be foul ground, though, when we pa&s;&s;ed near it, we did not perceive any.</P>
<P>On the 2d of December, in the morning, one of the Chine&s;e contractors, who are known by the appellation of <HI>Compradors,</HI> came on board the Re&s;olution, and &s;old to Captain Gore as much beef as weighed two hundred pounds, to|gether with a con&s;iderable quantity of eggs, oranges, and greens. The Di&s;covery received a proportional &s;hare of the&s;e articles; and an agree|ment was made with the <HI>comprador</HI> to provide us a daily &s;upply, for which, however, he in&s;i&s;ted on our paying him before-hand.</P>
<P>As our pilot now pretended that he could con|duct the &s;hips no further, Captain Gore was under the nece&s;&s;ity of di&s;charging him; and we were left to our own guidance and direction. At two o'clock in the afternoon, the tide flowing, we took up our anchors, and worked to windward; and, at &s;even, anchored again in three fathoms and a half of water; at which time Macao bore we&s;t, at the di&s;tance of one league. This was, indeed, a very ineligible &s;ituation; for it was expo&s;ed to the north-ea&s;t, and had &s;hoal water, not exceeding two fathoms and a half in depth, to leeward; but as, in the narrative of Lord An&s;on's voyage, no nautical de&s;cription is given of the harbour wherein the Centurian anchored, and Mr. Dalrymple's general map was on too
<PB N="223" REF="030274_1512_0FE57ADC0FCC1528">
&s;mall a &s;cale to be of much &s;ervice in directing us, our &s;hips were obliged to continue there during the whole night.</P>
<P>Captain Gore, in the evening, di&s;patched Cap|tain King to Macao, to pay a vi&s;it to the Portu|gue&s;e Governor, and to reque&s;t the favour of his a&s;&s;i&s;tance in &s;upplying our people with provi&s;ions, which he imagined might be done on more mo|derate terms than the <HI>Comprador</HI> would undertake to furni&s;h them. Captain King, at the &s;ame time, took an account of the naval &s;tores, of which both our &s;hips were in great want, with an intention of repairing immediately to Canton, and making application to the &s;ervants of our Ea&s;t-India company, who re&s;ided there at that time.</P>
<P>Upon Mr. King's arrival at the citadel, he was informed by the fort-major, that the governor was indi&s;po&s;ed, and was therefore unwilling to receive vi&s;itors, but that we might depend on meeting with every a&s;&s;i&s;tance in their power. This, however, Mr. King under&s;tood would be very incon&s;iderable, &s;ince they were perfectly de|pendent on the Chine&s;e even for their deily &s;up|port. Indeed, the an&s;wer that was returned to Mr. King's fir&s;t reque&s;t, furni&s;hed a &s;ufficient proof of the reduced &s;tate of the Portugue&s;e power; for, on his &s;ignifying to the Major his de&s;ire of proceeding to Canton as &s;oon as po&s;|&s;ible, the latter acquainted him, that they could
<PB N="224" REF="030274_1513_0FE57AB597F8BBE8">
not pre&s;ume to provide a boat for him, till per|mi&s;&s;ion had been obtained from the <HI>Hoppo,</HI> or officer of the cu&s;toms; and that it was nece&s;&s;ary to apply, for this purpo&s;e, to the Chine&s;e govern|ment at Canton.</P>
<P>Captain King's mortification at &s;o unexpected a delay, could be equalled only by the eager im|patience with which we had &s;o long waited for an opportunity of gaining information with regard to European affairs. It not unfrequently hap|pens, that amid&s;t the ardent pur&s;uit of an object, we neglect the mo&s;t obvious means of attaining it. This was, indeed, Mr. King's ca&s;e at pre|&s;ent; for he was returning to the &s;hip in a &s;tate of great dejection, when the Portugue&s;e officer, who accompanied him, a&s;ked him whether he did not intend to vi&s;it the Engli&s;h gentlemen at Macao. It is unnece&s;&s;ary to add with what tran&s;port Mr. King received the intelligence con|veyed to him by this que&s;tion; as well as with what anxious hopes and fears, what a conflict between curio&s;ity and apprehen&s;ion, his mind was agitated, as he and his companions walked towards the hou&s;e of one of their countrymen. The reception they met with was by no means deficient in civility or kindne&s;s, though, from the &s;tate of agitation they were in, it appeared to them rather cold and formal. In their inquiries as far as regarded objects of private concern, they obtained, as was indeed to be expected,
<PB N="225" REF="030274_1514_0FE57A614060DCE0">
little or no &s;atisfaction; but the occurrences of a public nature, which had happened &s;ince the period of our departure from England, and which now, for the fir&s;t time, bur&s;t all at once upon them, overwhelmed all other feelings, and almo&s;t deprived them, for &s;ome time, of the power of re|flection.</P>
<P>The information now received by Mr. King and his attendants, being communicated to tho&s;e who remained on board, we continued, for &s;eve|ral days, to que&s;tion each other with re&s;pect to the truth of it, as if de&s;irous of &s;eeking, in doubt and &s;u&s;pence, for that con&s;olation, which the reality of our mi&s;fortunes &s;eemed entirely to exclude. To the&s;e &s;en&s;ations the mo&s;t poignant regret &s;uc|ceeded, on finding our&s;elves cut off, at &s;o great a a di&s;tance, from the &s;cene, where, we &s;uppo&s;ed, the fate of contending fleets and armies was conti|nually deciding.</P>
<P>The intelligence we had gained concerning the &s;tate of affairs in Europe, rendered us the more anxious to accelerate our departure as much as we po&s;&s;ibly could. Captain King, therefore, re|newed his endeavours to procure a pa&s;&s;age to Canton, but did not meet with &s;ucce&s;s at pre&s;ent. He was now informed, that the difficulty ari&s;ing from the &s;ettled policy of the country, would, in all probability, be greatly augmented by an in|cident which had occurred a few weeks before our arrival. Captain Panton had been &s;ent from
<PB N="226" REF="030274_1515_0FE57AB412B66BA8">
Madras, in a &s;hip of war of twenty-five guns, called the Sea-hor&s;e, for the purpo&s;e of urging the payment of a debt which the Chine&s;e mer|chants of Canton owed to private Briti&s;h &s;ubjects in Europe and India, and which amounted, as we under&s;tood, to almo&s;t a million &s;terling, in|cluding the principal and compound intere&s;t. With this view, he was directed to make a peremptory demand of an audience of the viceroy of Canton, which after &s;ome delay, and not be|fore recour&s;e had been had to menaces, was at length granted. The an&s;wer he received, with regard to the &s;ubject of his mi&s;&s;ion, was fair and &s;atisfactory: but he had no &s;ooner departed, than an edict was &s;tuck up in the public places of the city, and on the hou&s;es of the Europeans, pro|hibiting all foreigners from lending money, on any pretence whatever, to the &s;ubjects of the em|peror of China.</P>
<P>This procedure had given occa&s;ion for very &s;erious alarms at Canton. The Chine&s;e mer|chants, who had contracted the debt, in oppo|&s;ition to the commercial laws of their country, and partly denied the ju&s;tice of the demand, were apprehen&s;ive le&s;t &s;ome intelligence of this &s;hould be conveyed to Pekin; in which ca&s;e the empe|ror, who is repre&s;ented as a ju&s;t and rigid prince, might perhaps puni&s;h them with the confi&s;cation of their property, if not with the lo&s;s of their lives. On the other hand, the Select Committee
<PB N="227" REF="030274_1516_0FE57AF300EFDE40">
at the Engli&s;h factory, to whom the Pre&s;idency of Madras had recommended, in &s;trong terms, the cau&s;e of the claimants, entertained violent apprehen&s;ions of embroiling them&s;elves with the Chine&s;e government at Canton, and of occa&s;ion|ing, by that means, great and perhaps irreparable detriment to the Ea&s;t-India Company's affairs in China. For the Mandarines, as Captain King was further informed, were con&s;tantly prepared to take occa&s;ion, even on the mo&s;t trivial grounds, to ob&s;truct their commerce; and it was frequently a very difficult matter, and always attended with expence, to get &s;uch re&s;traints taken off. The&s;e impo&s;itions were continually augmenting; and, indeed, Mr. King found it the general opinion, in all the European factories, that they &s;hould, pro|bably, in a &s;hort time, be reduced to the mortifying alternative, either of quitting their commercial in|tercour&s;e with China, or enduring the &s;ame indig|nities to which the Dutch are &s;ubjected in the Ja|pane&s;e dominions.</P>
<P>The arrival of our two &s;hips, at &s;uch a time, could not fail of giving ri&s;e to fre&s;h alarms. Captain King, therefore, finding there was no pro&s;pect of his proceeding to Canton, di&s;patched a letter to the Committee of the Engli&s;h Super|cargoes, to inform them of the rea&s;on of our putting into the Tygris, and to reque&s;t their a&s;&s;i&s;tance in procuring him a pa&s;&s;port, as well as in forwarding the &s;tores we had occa&s;ion for (of
<PB N="228" REF="030274_1517_0FE57AC6FAC31358">
which Mr. King &s;ent them a li&s;t) with all po&s;&s;ible expedition.</P>
<P>The following morning, Captain King was accompanied on board by our countrymen; who acquainting us with the &s;ituation of the Typa, we weighed anchor between &s;ix and &s;even o'clock, and &s;teered towards it; but the wind &s;ailing, we again came too, at eight, in three fathoms and a half; the Grand Ladrone bearing &s;outh-ea&s;t by &s;outh, and Macao we&s;t-north-we&s;t, at the di&s;tance of three miles.</P>
<P>The Portugue&s;e &s;ort was here &s;aluted by the Re&s;olution with eleven guns, and the compli|ment was returned by an equal number. Early in the morning of the 4th, we weighed again, and &s;tood into the Typa, where we moored with the &s;tream anchor and cable to the we&s;t.</P>
<P>As the <HI>Comprador,</HI> with whom we at fir&s;t en|gaged, had taken the liberty of going off with a &s;mall &s;um of money, which he had received from us before-hand for the purcha&s;e of provi&s;ions, we entered into an agreement with another, who &s;up|plied both our ve&s;&s;els during the whole time of our continuance here. This was done with &s;e|crecy, and in the night, on pretence of its being contrary to the e&s;tabli&s;hed regulations of the port; but we were inclined to &s;u&s;pect, that all this caution was practi&s;ed either with a view of en|hancing the price of the articles provided by him, or of &s;ecuring to him&s;elf the emoluments of his
<PB N="229" REF="030274_1518_0FE57A86B2850778">
contract, without being under the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;haring them with the Mandarines.</P>
<P>On Thur&s;day the 9th, Captain Gore received an an&s;wer from the Engli&s;h Supercargoes at Can|ton, in which they promi&s;ed to exert their mo&s;t &s;trenuous endeavours in procuring the &s;upplies of which we were in want, with all po&s;&s;ible di&s;|patch, and a&s;&s;ured him, that a pa&s;&s;port &s;hould be &s;ent for one of our officers; expre&s;&s;ing their hopes, at the &s;ame time, that we were &s;ufficiently acquainted with the character of the Chine&s;e ad|mini&s;tration, to impute any delays, that might unavoidably occur, to their true cau&s;e.</P>
<P>The next day, an Engli&s;h merchant, from one of our Ea&s;t-Indian &s;ettlements, made application to Captain Gore for the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a few of his people, to navigate as far as Canton a ve&s;&s;el which he had purcha&s;ed at Macao. Captain Gore, con&s;idering this as a good opportunity for Mr. King to repair to that city, gave orders, that he &s;hould take with him his &s;econd lieutenant, the lieutenant of marines, and ten &s;ailors.</P>
<P>Though this was not the exact mode in which Captain King could have wi&s;hed to vi&s;it Canton, yet as it was highly uncertain when the pa&s;&s;port would arrive, and his pre&s;ence might be of great &s;ervice in expediting the requi&s;ite &s;upplies; he did not &s;cruple to go on board the ve&s;&s;el, having left orders with Mr. William&s;on to prepare the Di&s;covery for &s;ea with all convenient &s;pee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and
<PB N="230" REF="030274_1519_0FE57A4967C64428">
make &s;uch additions and improvements in her upper works, as might contribute to render her more defen&s;ible. That the &s;eries of our a&s;trono|mical ob&s;ervations might not be interrupted by his ab&s;ence, he entru&s;ted Mr. Trevenen with the care of continuing them; as he repo&s;ed a perfect confidence in the abilities and a&s;&s;iduity of that gentleman.</P>
<P>Mr. King and his attendants quitted the har|bour of Macao on Saturday the 11th; and &s;ail|ing round the &s;outh-ea&s;tern extreme of the i&s;land, &s;teering a northerly cour&s;e, leaving on their right-hand, as they pa&s;&s;ed along, Lantao Lintin, and &s;everal i&s;les of &s;maller extent. All the&s;e i&s;lands, as well as that of Macao, which is &s;ituated to the left, are totally de&s;titute of wood: the land is high and unfertile, and is not inhabited, except occa&s;ionally by fi&s;hermen.</P>
<P>As they approached the Bocca Tygris, which is near forty miles di&s;tant from Macao, the coa&s;t of China appeared to the ea&s;tward in &s;teep white cliffs. The two forts, that command the mouth of the river, were, at this time, exactly in the &s;ame &s;tate they were in when Lord An&s;on was here. That which &s;tands to the left is a fine old ca&s;tle, environed by a grove of trees, and has a plea&s;ing and romantic a&s;pect.</P>
<P>The ve&s;&s;el was here vi&s;ited by an officer of the cu&s;toms; upon which occa&s;ion, the per&s;on to whom it belonged, being apprehen&s;ive that, if
<PB N="231" REF="030274_1520_0FE57AE14D4D9FD8">
our party &s;hould be di&s;covered on board, it would produce &s;ome alarm, and might perhaps be attend|ed with di&s;agreeable con&s;equences, reque&s;ted them to retire into the cabin below.</P>
<P>Above the&s;e forts, the breadth of the river is va|riable, the banks being flat and low, and &s;ubject to great inundations from the tide. The land on both &s;ides, is level, and laid out in fields of rice; but, as our party advanced, it was ob&s;erved to ri&s;e gradually into hills of con&s;iderable declivity, who&s;e &s;ides were cut into terraces, and planted with &s;ugar-canes, yams, &s;weet potatoes, the cotton tree, and plantains. They al&s;o perceived many lofty <HI>pagodas,</HI> di&s;per&s;ed about the country, and &s;e|veral towns at a di&s;tance, &s;ome of which &s;eemed to be of great magnitude.</P>
<P>Their progre&s;s being retarded by contrary winds, and the lightne&s;s of the ve&s;&s;el, they did not arrive at Wampu, which is no more than nine leagues from the Bocca Tygris, till the 18th. Wampu is a &s;mall town, off which the &s;hips of the various nations, who trade with the Chine&s;e are &s;tationed, in order to receive their re&s;pective ladings. It is a&s;&s;erted by Mon&s;ieur Sonnerat, that the river, higher up, is not &s;ufficiently deep for the admi&s;&s;ion of ve&s;&s;els that are heavily laden, even if the policy of the Chine&s;e had permitted Europeans to navigate them up to Canton. With re&s;pect to this circum&s;tance, however, we cannot pretend to decide, as no &s;tranger, we believe,
<PB N="232" REF="030274_1521_0FE57AF609196438">
has been allowed to inform him&s;elf with certainty of the truth. The little i&s;lands, that are &s;ituated oppo&s;ite the town, are appropriated to the &s;eve|ral factories, who have erected werehou&s;es for the reception of the various articles of merchan|dize which are brought down from Canton.</P>
<P>At Wampu, Captain King embarked in a <HI>&s;am|pane,</HI> or Chine&s;e boat, and immediately proceed|ed to Canton, which is eight or nine miles higher up the river. The&s;e <HI>&s;ampanes</HI> are the neate&s;t and mo&s;t commodious boats for pa&s;&s;engers that Mr. King ever &s;aw. They are of different &s;izes, of great breadth upon the beam, nearly flat at the bottom, and narrow at the head and &s;tern, which are elevated, and embelli&s;hed with ornaments. The middle part, where Mr. King &s;at, was arch|ed over with a roof made of bamboo, which may, at plea&s;ure, be rai&s;ed or lowered; in the &s;ides were &s;mall windows which had &s;hutters to them; and the apartment was furni&s;hed with tables, chairs, and hand&s;ome mats. A &s;mall waxen idol was placed in the &s;tern, in a ca&s;e of gilt leather. Before this image &s;tood a pot, that contained lighted tapers made of matches, or dry chips, and gum. The fare of this boat amounted to a Spani&s;h dollar.</P>
<P>Captain King reached Canton in the evening, and di&s;embarked at the Engli&s;h factory, where though his arrival was wholly unexpected, he was received with every mark of civility and re|&s;pect.
<PB N="233" REF="030274_1522_0FE57A5E31C6D410">
Me&s;&s;rs. Fitzhugh, Bevan, and Rapier, compo&s;ed, at this time, the Select Committee; and the former of the&s;e gentlemen acted as Pre&s;i|dent. They immediately gave Mr. King an in|ventory of tho&s;e &s;tores with which the Ea&s;t-India &s;hips were able to &s;upply us; and though he did not entertain the &s;malle&s;t doubt, that the com|manders were willing to a&s;&s;i&s;t us with whatever they could &s;pare, con&s;i&s;tently with a regard to the intere&s;t of their employers, as well as their own &s;afety, yet it was a great di&s;appointment to him to ob&s;erve in their li&s;t &s;carcely any canva&s;s or cordage, of both which articles we were chiefly in want. It afforded him, however, &s;ome con&s;olation to find that the &s;tores were ready to be &s;hipped, and that the provi&s;ions we had occa&s;ion for might be had at a day's notice.</P>
<P>Mr. King being de&s;irous of making his &s;tay here as &s;hort as po&s;&s;ible, reque&s;ted that the gen|tlemen would endeavour to procure junks or boats for him the next day, as it was his intention to quit Canton the following one; but they gave him to under&s;tand, that a bu&s;ine&s;s of that nature was not to be tran&s;acted with &s;uch quickne&s;s in the Chine&s;e dominions; that leave mu&s;t previ|ou&s;ly be obtained from the Viceroy; that appli|cation mu&s;t be made to the <HI>Hoppo,</HI> or principal officer of the cu&s;toms, for <HI>chops,</HI> or permits; and that it was not cu&s;tomary to grant &s;uch favours without mature deliberation: in &s;hort, that pa|tience
<PB N="234" REF="030274_1523_0FE57A9DD947D8F8">
was a virtue e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary in China; and that they hoped they &s;hould have the plea&s;ure of rendering the factory agreeable to him, for a few days longer than he &s;eemed inclined to favour them with his company.</P>
<P>Though Captain King was not much di&s;po&s;ed to be plea&s;ed with this compliment, he could not avoid being diverted with an incident which oc|curred very &s;ea&s;onably to convince him of the truth of their repre&s;entations, and of the &s;u&s;picious character that di&s;tingui&s;hes the Chine&s;e. Our readers will doubtle&s;s recollect, that it was now upwards of a fortnight &s;ince Captain Gore had written to the gentlemen of the factory, to &s;oli|cit, their a&s;&s;i&s;tance in gaining permi&s;&s;ion for one of his officers to repair to Canton. In con&s;e|quence of this application they had mention<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> the affair to one of the principal Chine&s;e mer|chants of that city, who had promi&s;ed to intere&s;t him&s;elf in our behalf, and to petition the Viceroy to grant our reque&s;t. This per&s;on came to vi&s;it Mr. Fitzhugh, the Pre&s;ident, while he and his colleagues were conver&s;ing with Captain King on the &s;ubject, and informed him, with great com|placency and &s;atisfaction in his countenance, that he had at length met with &s;ucce&s;s in his &s;olicita|tions, and that a pa&s;&s;port would be i&s;&s;ued in a few days for one of the officers of the Ladrone &s;hip, or pirate. Mr. Fitzhugh immediately de|&s;ired him not to give him&s;elf any further trouble
<PB N="235" REF="030274_1524_0FE57AF7F19AB330">
in this bu&s;ine&s;s, as the officer (pointing to Captain King) was already arrived. The con&s;ternation, with which the old Chine&s;e merchant was &s;eized on hearing this intelligence, is almo&s;t incon|ceivable. His head &s;unk in&s;tantaneo&s;ly upon his brea&s;t, and the &s;ofa, on which he &s;at, &s;hook, from the violence of his emotion. Whether the Ladrone &s;hip (as he called it) was the object of his apprehen&s;ions, or his own government, Cap|tain King could not determine; but, after he had continued a few minutes in this &s;tate of agita|tion, Mr. Bevan begged him not to de&s;pair, and acquainted him with the manner in which the Captain had pa&s;&s;ed from Macao, the motives of his journey to Canton, and his wi&s;hes to quit that city as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible. As this la&s;t circum|&s;tance &s;eemed to be particularly agreeable to the old man, Mr. King flattered him&s;elf that he &s;hould find him di&s;po&s;ed to accelerate his depar|ture; but he had no &s;ooner recovered from his con&s;ternation, than he began to recount the un|avoidable delays that would occur in our bu&s;ine&s;s, the difficulty of obtaining an audience of the Viceroy, the jealou&s;ies and &s;u&s;picions entertained by the Mandarines with regard to our real de|&s;igns, which, he affirmed, had ri&s;en to an un|common height, from the &s;trange account that we had given of our&s;elves.</P>
<P>After Captain King had waited &s;everal days, with great impatience, for the i&s;&s;ue of his negotia|tion,
<PB N="236" REF="030274_1525_0FE57AD0DCEE18F0">
without finding that the affair was in the lea&s;t advanced towards a conclu&s;ion, he made application to the commander of an Engli&s;h country &s;hip, who intended to &s;ail on the 25th, and who offered to take on board the men and &s;tores, and to lie too, unle&s;s the weather &s;hould prevent him, off Macao, till we could di&s;patch boats to receive them out of his ve&s;&s;el. He at the &s;ame time appri&s;ed Captain King of the danger he might perhaps incur of being driven with them out to &s;ea.</P>
<P>While Mr. King was con&s;idering what &s;teps he &s;hould take, the commander of another country &s;hip, pre&s;ented him with a letter from Captain Gore, importing that he had engaged this com|mander to bring our party from Canton, and to deliver our &s;upplies, at his own hazard, in the Typa. All difficulties being thus removed, Mr. King had lei&s;ure to be&s;tow &s;ome attention on the purcha&s;e of our &s;tores and provi&s;ions, which he completed on the 26th; and on the &s;ucceeding day, the whole &s;tock was conveyed on board.</P>
<P>Captain Gore being of opinion, that Canton would be the mo&s;t advantageous market for furs, had de&s;ired Mr. King to take with him about twenty &s;kins of &s;ea-otters; mo&s;t of which had been the property of our decea&s;ed Commanders, and to di&s;po&s;e of them at the be&s;t price he could obtain; a commi&s;&s;ion which furni&s;hed him with an opportunity of becoming acquainted, in &s;ome
<PB N="237" REF="030274_1526_0FE57A4F176814A8">
degree, with the genius of the Chine&s;e for trade. Mr. King having informed &s;ome of the Engli&s;h &s;upercargoes of the&s;e circum&s;tances, reque&s;ted that they would recommend him to &s;ome reputable Chine&s;e merchant, who would at once offer him a rea&s;onable price for the &s;kins. They accordingly directed him to a member of the <HI>Hong,</HI> (an appel|lation given to a &s;ociety of the principal merchants of the city) who being fully appri&s;ed of the nature of the bu&s;ine&s;s, &s;eemed to be &s;en&s;ible of the deli|cacy of Mr. King's &s;ituation, and a&s;&s;ured him that he might rely on his integrity, and that, in an affair of this kind, he &s;hould con&s;ider him&s;elf as a mere agent, without &s;eeking to acquire any profit for him&s;elf.</P>
<P>The &s;kins being laid before this merchant, he examined them over and over again with parti|cular attention, and at la&s;t informed Captain King, that he could not think of offering more than three hundred dollars for them. As the Captain was convinced, from the price at which our &s;kins had been &s;old in Kamt&s;chatka, that he had not offered one half of their value, he found him&s;elf obliged to drive a bargain. He there|fore in his turn, demanded a thou&s;and dollars; the Chine&s;e merchant then advanced to five hun|dred; after which he offered Mr. King a private pre&s;ent of porcelain and tea, which amounted to a hundred more; then he propo&s;ed to give the &s;ame &s;um in money; and at length ro&s;e to &s;even
<PB N="238" REF="030274_1527_0FE57AC883849E98">
hundred dollars, upon which the Captain lowered his demands to nine hundred. Here, each of them declaring that he would not recede, they parted; but the Chine&s;e &s;peedily returned with a li&s;t of Ea&s;t-Indian commodities, which he now de&s;ired that Mr. King would taken in exchange, and which (as the Captain was afterwards inform|ed) would have amounted in value, if faithfully delivered, to double the &s;um the merchant had before offered. Finding the Captain unwilling to deal in this mode, he finally propo&s;ed, that they &s;hould divide the difference, which Mr. King, weary of the conte&s;t, agreed to, and received the eight hundred dollars.</P>
<P>Captain King, from the ill health under which he at pre&s;ent laboured, had but little rea&s;on to lament the very narrow bounds, within which every European at Canton is obliged, by the &s;u&s;picious policy of the Chine&s;e, to confine his cu|rio&s;ity. He would otherwi&s;e, doubtle&s;s, have felt him&s;elf extremely tantalized with living under the walls of a city of &s;uch magnitude, and &s;o re|plete with objects of novelty, without being per|mitted to enter it.</P>
<P>The accounts of Canton, as well as of the other parts of China, by Le Comte and Du Halde, mo&s;t of our readers have, in all probability, peru&s;ed. The&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> authors have lately been charged by Mon&s;ieur Sonnerat with having been guilty of great exaggeration; for which rea&s;on the &s;ub&s;e|quent
<PB N="239" REF="030274_1528_0FE57A5CAE2A7B40">
remarks collected by Captain King from the intelligence which he received from &s;everal Engli&s;h gentlemen, who had re&s;ided a long time at Canton, may not improperly be introduced.</P>
<P>The circumference of Canton, including the old and new town, and al&s;o the &s;uburbs, is about ten miles. With regard to its population, Mr. King, judging of the whole from what he &s;aw in the &s;uburbs, is of opinion, that it falls con&s;iderably &s;hort of an European town of equal magnitude. Le Comte has e&s;timated the number of its inha|bitants at one million five hundred thou&s;and; Du Halde at a million; and M. Sonnerat affirms he has a&s;certained that their number does not exceed &s;eventy-five thou&s;and <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"J'ai <HI>verifi&eacute;</HI> moi-meme, avec plu&s;ieurs Chinois, la population de Canton," &amp;c. <HI>Voyage aux Indes Grientales et &agrave; la Ck us, M. Sonnerat,</HI> vol ii&punc; p. 14.</NOTE>: but, as this gen|tleman has not thought proper to communicate to us the grounds on which he founded his cal|culation, and, be&s;ides, &s;eems to be as much in|clined to depreciate whatever relates to the Chi|ne&s;e nation, as the Je&s;uits may be to magnify, his opinion does not lay claim to an implicit a&s;&s;ent. The following particulars may perhaps enable our readers to form a judgment on this point with &s;ome degree of accuracy.</P>
<P>It is certain, that a Chine&s;e hou&s;e, in general, occupies more &s;pace than is commonly taken up by hou&s;es in Europe; but the proportion of four
<PB N="240" REF="030274_1529_0FE57B1141509FC8">
or five to one, &s;ugge&s;ted by M. Sonnerat, mu&s;t be acknowledged to go far beyond the truth. To this we may add, that a con&s;iderable number of hou&s;es, in the &s;uburbs of Canton, are kept only for the purpo&s;es of commerce, by merchants and opulent trade&s;men, who&s;e families re&s;ide entirely within the walls. On the other hand, a Chine&s;e family, upon an average is more numerous than an European. A Mandarine, in proportion to his rank and property, has from five to twenty wives. A merchant has from three to five. A per&s;on of the latter cla&s;s at Canton, had, indeed, five and twenty wives, and &s;ix and thirty children; but this was mentioned to Captain King as a very uncommon circum&s;tance. A wealthy trade&s;man has generally two wives; and people of an inferior &s;tation very rarely have more than one. They have, at lea&s;t double the number of &s;ervants em|ployed by Europeans of the &s;ame rank. If, there|fore, we &s;uppo&s;e a Chine&s;e family to be larger by one third, and an European hou&s;e le&s;s by two-thirds, than each other, a city of China will com|prehend only half the number of people contained in a town of the &s;ame extent in Europe. Accord|ing to the&s;e <HI>po&s;tulata,</HI> the city and &s;uburbs of Can|ton may contain, in all probability, about a hun|dred and fifty thou&s;and inhabitants.</P>
<P>Captain King found various opinions entertain|ed re&s;pecting the number of inhabited <HI>&s;ampanes:</HI> but none computed them to be under forty
<PB N="241" REF="030274_1530_0FE57A55E1D6C7E0">
thou&s;and. They are moored in rows, clo&s;e to each other, a narrow pa&s;&s;age being left, at inter|vals for the boats to pa&s;s and repa&s;s on the river. The Tygris, at Canton, being of greater width than the Thames at London, and the whole river, for the &s;pace at lea&s;t of a mile, being covered in this manner, it does not appear that this e&s;timate of their number is at all exaggerated; and if it be allowed, the inhabitants in the <HI>&s;ampanes</HI> alone, each of which contains one family, mu&s;t amount to almo&s;t thrice the number affirmed by M. Sonnerat to be in the whole city.</P>
<P>Fifty thou&s;and men con&s;titute the military force of the province of Quangtong; of which Canton is the capital. It is a&s;&s;erted, that twenty thou&s;and are &s;tationed in the city and its environs; and Captain King was a&s;&s;ured, that, on occa&s;ion of &s;ome commotion which had happened at Canton, thirty thou&s;and troops had been drawn together in the cour&s;e of a few hours.</P>
<P>The &s;treets of this city are long, and mo&s;t of them are narrow and de&s;titute of uniformity. They are well paved with large &s;tones, and, in general, kept extremely clean. The hou&s;es are built of brick, and are only one &s;tory high. They have, for the mo&s;t part, two or three courts backwards, in which are erected the warehou&s;es for the reception of merchandize, and, in the hou&s;es within the city, the apartments for the females. Some of the meaner &s;ort of people,

though very few have their habitations compo&s;ed of wood.</P>
<P>The hou&s;es of the European factors are built on a fine quay, having a regular facade of two &s;tories towards the river. They are con&s;tructed, with re&s;pect to the in&s;ide, partly after the Chine&s;e, and partly after the European mode. Adjoining to the&s;e are a con&s;iderable number of hou&s;es which belong to the Chine&s;e, and are let out by them to the commanders of ve&s;&s;els, and to mer|chants, who make only an occa&s;ional &s;tay.</P>
<P>As no European is permitted to take his wife with him to Canton, the Engli&s;h &s;upercargoes live together, at a common table, which is main|tained by the company; and each of them has al&s;o an apartment appropriated to him&s;elf, con|&s;i&s;ting of three or four rooms. The period of their re&s;idence rarely exceeds eight months in a year; and as, during that time, they are almo&s;t con&s;tantly occupied in the &s;ervice of the com|pany, they may &s;ubmit, with the le&s;s unea&s;ine&s;s and regret, to the re&s;trictions under which they live. They very &s;eldom make any vi&s;its within the walls of Canton, except on public occa&s;ions. Indeed nothing contributed more to give Captain King an unfavourable opinion of the character of the Chine&s;e, than his finding, that, among &s;o many per&s;ons of ingenuous and liberal minds, as well as of amiable manners, &s;everal of whom had been re&s;ident in that country for near fifteen &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ive
<PB N="243" REF="030274_1532_0FE57A6EDC10FF60">
years, they had never formed any &s;ocial connection or friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the la&s;t &s;hip departs from Wampu, they are all under the nece&s;&s;ity of retiring to Macao; but they leave behind them all the money they po&s;&s;e&s;s in <HI>&s;pecie,</HI> which Mr. King was informed, &s;ometimes amounts to a hundred thou|&s;and pounds &s;terling, and for which they have no other &s;ecurity than the &s;eals of the Viceroy, the Mandarines, and the merchants of the <HI>Hong:</HI> a &s;triking proof of the excellent police maintained in China.</P>
<P>Captain King, during his continuance at Can|ton, accompanied one of the Engli&s;h gentlemen on a vi&s;it to a per&s;on of the fir&s;t di&s;tinction in the place. They were received in a long room or gallery, at the further end of which a table was placed, with a large chair behind it, and a row of chairs extending from it, on both &s;ides, down the room. The captain having been previou&s;ly in&s;tructed, that the point of politene&s;s con&s;i&s;ted in remaining un&s;eated as long as po&s;&s;ible, readily &s;ubmitting to this piece of <HI>etiquette</HI>; after which he and his friend were treated with tea, and &s;ome fre&s;h and pre&s;erved fruits. Their entertainer was very corpulent, had a dull heavy countenance, and di&s;played great gravity in his deportment. He had learned to &s;peak a little broken Engli&s;h and Portugueze. After his two gue&s;ts had taken their refre&s;hment, he conducted them about his
<PB N="244" REF="030274_1533_0FE57AA8E1B8FAF8">
hou&s;e and garden; and when he had &s;hewn them all the improvements he was making, they took their leave.</P>
<P>Captain King being de&s;irous of avoiding the trouble and delay that might attend an applica|tion for pa&s;&s;ports, as well as of &s;aving the unnece&s;|&s;ary expence of hiring a <HI>&s;ampane,</HI> which he was in|formed amounted at lea&s;t to twelve pounds &s;ter|ling, had hitherto de&s;igned to go along with the &s;upplies to Macoa, in the country merchant's &s;hip we mentioned before: but receiving an invitation from two Engli&s;h gentlemen, who had found means to procure pa&s;&s;ports for four, he accepted, together with Mr. Philips, their offer of places in a Chine&s;e boat, and entru&s;ted Mr. Lannyon with the &s;uperintendance of the men and &s;tores, which were to &s;ail the following day.</P>
<P>On Sunday the 26th, in the evening, Captain King took his leave of the &s;upercargoes, after having returned them thanks for their many fa|vours; among which mu&s;t be mentioned a pre|&s;ent of a con&s;iderable quantity of tea, for the u&s;e of the companies of both &s;hips, and a copious col|lection of Engli&s;h periodical publications. The latter proved a valuable acqui&s;ition to us, as they not only &s;erved to beguile our impatience, in the pro&s;ecution of our tedious voyage homewards, but al&s;o enabled us to return not wholly unacquainted with what had been tran&s;acting in our native country during our ab&s;ence.</P>
<P><PB N="245" REF="030274_1534_0FE57B2DC09E0138">At one o'clock in the morning of the 27th, Me&s;&s;rs. King and Phillips, and the two Engli&s;h gentlemen, quitted Canton, and, about the &s;ame hour of the &s;ucceeding day, arrived at Macao, having pa&s;&s;ed down a channel &s;ituated to the we&s;t of that by which Mr. King had come up.</P>
<P>During the ab&s;ence of our party from Macao, a bri&s;k traffic had been carrying on with the Chine&s;e for four &s;ea-otter &s;kins, the value of which had augmented every day. One of our &s;ailors di&s;po&s;ed of his &s;tock, alone, for eight hundred dollars; and a few of the be&s;t &s;kins, which were clean, and had been carefully pre|&s;erved, produced a hundred and twenty dollars each. The total amount of the value, in goods and ca&s;h, that was obtained for the furs of both our ve&s;&s;els, we are confident was not le&s;s than two thou&s;and pounds &s;terling; and it was the general opinion, that at lea&s;t two-thirds of the quantity we had originally procured from the Americans, were by this time &s;poiled and worn out, or had been be&s;towed as pre&s;ents, and otherwi&s;e di&s;po&s;ed of, in Kamt&s;chatka. If, in addition to the&s;e facts, we con&s;ider, that we at fir&s;t collected the furs without having ju&s;t ideas of their real value; that mo&s;t of them had been worn by the &s;avages from whom we purcha&s;ed them; that little regard was afterwards &s;hewn to their pre|&s;ervation; that they were frequently made u&s;e of as bed-clothes, and likewi&s;e for other purpo&s;es,
<PB N="246" REF="030274_1535_0FE57B52A6C1D060">
during our cruize to the northward; and that, in all probability, we never received the full value for them in China; the benefits that might accrue from a voyage to that part of the American coa&s;t where we obtained them, undertaken with com|mercial views, will certainly appear of &s;ufficient importance to claim the public attention.</P>
<P>So great was the rage with which our &s;eamen were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed to return to Cook's River, and there procure another cargo of &s;kins, by which they might be enabled to make their fortunes, that, at one time, they were almo&s;t on the point of proceeding to a mutiny. And Captain King acknowledges, that he could not refrain from in|dulging him&s;elf in a project, which was fir&s;t &s;ugge&s;ted to him by the di&s;appointment we had met with in being compelled to leave the Japa|ne&s;e Archipelago, as well as the northern coa&s;t of China, unexplored; and he is of opinion, that this object may &s;till be happily attained, by means of our Ea&s;t-India Company, not only with trifling expence, but even with the pro&s;pect of very be|neficial con&s;equences. The &s;tate of affairs at home, or perhaps greater difficulties in the ac|compli&s;hment of his plan that he had fore&s;een, have hitherto prevented its being carried into execution; but, as the &s;cheme &s;eems to be well contrived, we hope the reader will not be di&s;plea&s;ed with in&s;erting it here.</P>
<P><PB N="247" REF="030274_1536_0FE57ABBF77261B8">In the fir&s;t place, Captain King propo&s;es, that the Ea&s;t-India Company's China &s;hips &s;hould, each, carry an additional number of men, mak|ing one hundred in the whole. Two ve&s;&s;els, one of two hundred tons, and the other of a hundred and fifty, might, with proper notice, (as Mr. King was informed) be purcha&s;ed at Canton; and, as victualling is as cheap there as in Europe, he has calculated that they might be completely equipped for &s;ea, with one year's provi&s;ions and pay, for the &s;um of &s;ix thou&s;and pounds, including the pur|cha&s;e. The expence of the requi&s;ite articles for barter is very incon&s;iderable.</P>
<P>Mr. King particularly recommends that each of the &s;hips &s;hould have a forge, five tons of un|wrought iron, and a &s;kilful &s;mith, with an ap|prentice and journeyman, who might occa&s;ionally make &s;uch tools, as the Indians &s;hould appear to have the greate&s;t inclination for po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing. For, though half a dozen of the fine&s;t &s;kins, obtained by us, were purcha&s;ed with twelve large green gla&s;s beads, yet it is very certain, that the fancy of the&s;e people, for ornamental articles, is ex|tremely capricious and variable; and that the only &s;ure commodity for their market is iron. To this might be added &s;everal bales of coar&s;e woollen cloth, two or three barrels of gla&s;s and copper trinkets, and a few gro&s;s of large pointed ca&s;e-knives.</P>
<P><PB N="248" REF="030274_1537_0FE57B00AACD2F10">The Captain propo&s;es two ve&s;&s;els, not only for the greater &s;ecurity of the voyage, but becau&s;e &s;ingle &s;hips ought never, in his opinion, to be &s;ent out for the purpo&s;e of di&s;covery. For where ri&s;ques are frequently to be run, and uncertain and dangerous experiments tried, it can by no means be expected that &s;ingle &s;hips &s;hould venture &s;o far, as where &s;ome &s;ecurity is provided again&s;t an un|fortunate accident.</P>
<P>When the &s;hips are prepared for &s;ea, they will &s;ail with the fir&s;t &s;outh-we&s;t mon&s;oon, which u&s;u|ally &s;ets in about the commencement of the month of April. They will &s;teer a northward cour&s;e, with this wind, along the Chine&s;e coa&s;t, beginning to make a more accurate &s;urvey from the mouth of the Nankin river, or the river Kyana, in the 30th degree of latitude, which is &s;uppo&s;ed to be the remote&s;t limit of this coa&s;t hitherto vi&s;ited by European ve&s;&s;els.</P>
<P>The extent of the great gulph called <HI>Whang Hay,</HI> or the yellow Sea, being at pre&s;ent un|known, it may be left to the Commander's di&s;|cretion, to proceed up it as far as he may think proper: he mu&s;t be cautious, however, not to entangle him&s;elf in it too far, le&s;t he &s;hould not have &s;ufficient time left for the pro&s;ecution of the remainder of his voyage. The &s;ame di&s;cretion may be u&s;ed, when he has reached the &s;traits of Te&s;&s;oi, with regard to the i&s;lands of Je&s;o, which,
<PB N="249" REF="030274_1538_0FE57A79A489FD18">
if the wind and weather &s;hould be favourable, he mu&s;t not neglect to explore.</P>
<P>Having arrived in the latitude of 51&deg; 40&prime;, where he will make the mo&s;t &s;outherly point of the i&s;le of Sagaleen, beyond which we have a con&s;ider|able knowledge of the &s;ea of Okot&s;k he will &s;teer towards the &s;outh, probably about the begin|ning of June, and exert his endeavours to fall in with the mo&s;t &s;outhern of the Kurile i&s;lands. If the accounts of the Ru&s;&s;ians may be depended on, Ooroop, or Nade&s;chda, will furni&s;h the &s;hips with a commodious harbour, where they may re|cruit their wood and water, and provide them|&s;elves with &s;uch refre&s;hments as the place may afford.</P>
<P>About the end of June the commander will di|rect his cour&s;e to the Shummagins, whence he will proceed to Cook's River, purcha&s;ing, in his pro|gre&s;s, as many &s;kins as po&s;&s;ible, without lo&s;ing too much time, &s;ince he ought to &s;ail again to the &s;outhward, and trace the coa&s;t with the utmo&s;t ac|curacy between the 56th and 50th degrees of lati|tude, the &s;pace where contrary winds drove us out of &s;ight of land.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be here ob&s;erved, that Captain King con&s;iders the purcha&s;e of &s;kins, in this expedi|tion, as a &s;econdary concern, for defraying the expence; and from our experience in the pre|&s;ent voyage, there is no rea&s;on to doubt that two hundred and fifty &s;kins, each worth a hundred
<PB N="250" REF="030274_1539_0FE57B07A4F7F570">
dollars, may be obtained without low of time; particularly as they will, in all probability, be met with along the coa&s;t to the &s;outh of Cook's River.</P>
<P>The Commander, after having continued about three months on the American coa&s;t, will &s;et out on his return to China in the former part of Octo|ber, taking care, in his route, to avoid as much as po&s;&s;ible, the tracks of preceding navigators. All that remains to be added on this &s;ubject, is, that if the fur trade &s;hould become an e&s;tabli&s;hed object of Indian commerce, many opportunities will occur of completing whatever may have been left unfi|ni&s;hed, in the voyage of which the outlines are here delineated.</P>
<P>A very ludicrous alteration took place in the dre&s;s of all our crew, in con&s;equence of the barter which the Chine&s;e had carried on with us for our &s;ea-otter &s;kins. On our arrival in the Typa, not only the &s;ailors, but likewi&s;e the young officers, were extremely ragged in their apparel; for, as the voyage had now exceeded, almo&s;t by a year, the time it was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ot fir&s;t &s;uppo&s;ed we &s;hould continue at &s;ea, the far greater part of our original &s;tock of European clothes had been long ago worn out, or repaired and patched up with &s;kins, and the diffe|rent manufactures we meet with in the cour&s;e of the expedition. The&s;e were now mixed and eked out with the gaye&s;t &s;ilks, and cottons that China could produce.</P>
<P><PB N="251" REF="030274_1540_0FE57AF486371C38">Mr. Lannyon arrived on the 30th, with the &s;tores and provi&s;ions, which, without delay, were &s;towed in due proportion on board of our two ve&s;&s;els. The following day, in compliance with an agreement made by Captain Gore, Mr. King &s;ent the Di&s;covery's &s;heet anchor to the country &s;hip, and, in return, received the guns by which &s;he before rode.</P>
<P>While we remained in the Typa, Captain King was &s;hewn in the garden of an Engli&s;h gentlemen at Macao, the rock, under which, according to the traditional accounts, Camoens, the celebrated Por|tugue&s;e poet, was accu&s;tomed to &s;it and compo&s;e his Lu&s;iad. It is an arch of con&s;iderable height, con&s;i&s;ting of one &s;olid &s;tone, and forming the en|trance of a grotto dug out of the elevated ground behind it. Large &s;preading trees over&s;hadow the rock, which commands a beautiful and exten|&s;ive pro&s;pect of the &s;ea, and the i&s;lands di&s;per&s;ed about it.</P>
<P>On Tue&s;day the 11th of January, 1780, two &s;ailors belonging to the Re&s;olution went off with a &s;ix-oared cutter; and though the mo&s;t diligent &s;earch was made, both that and the &s;ucceeding day, we never could gain any intelligence of her. It was imagined, that the&s;e &s;eamen had been &s;e|duced by hopes of acquiring a fortune, if they &s;hould return to the fur i&s;lands.</P>
<P>As, during our continuance in the Typa, we heard nothing with re&s;pect to the mea&s;urement
<PB N="252" REF="030274_1541_0FE57B549B2E5FC0">
of the &s;hips, we may rea&s;onably conclude, that the point &s;o &s;trongly conte&s;ted, in Commodore An|&s;on's times by the Chine&s;e, has, in con&s;equence of his courage and firmne&s;s, never &s;ince been in&s;i&s;ted on.</P>
<P>According to the ob&s;ervations that were made while our ve&s;&s;els lay here, the harbour of Macao is &s;ituated in the latitude of 22&deg; 12&prime; north, and the longitude of 113&deg; 47&prime; ea&s;t; our anchoring-place in the Typa, in the latitude of 22&deg; 9&prime; 20&Prime; north, and the longitude of 113&deg; 48&prime; 34&Prime; ea&s;t; and the va|riation of the compa&s;s was 19&prime; we&s;t.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>WE unmoored on the 12th of January, at twelve o'clock, and &s;caled the guns, which, on board the Di&s;covery, amounted at this time to ten; &s;o that her people, by means of four additional ports, could fight &s;even on a &s;ide. In the Re&s;olution likewi&s;e, the number of guns had
<PB N="254" REF="030274_1543_0FE57ADF63717C80">
been augmented from twelve to &s;ixteen; and, in each of our ve&s;&s;els, a &s;trong barricade had been carried round the upper works, and all other pre|cautions taken to give our incon&s;iderable force a re&s;pectable appearance.</P>
<P>We con&s;idered it as our duty to furni&s;h our|&s;elves with the&s;e means of defence, though there was &s;ome rea&s;on to believe, that they had, in a great mea&s;ure, been rendered &s;uperfluous by the genero&s;ity of our enemies. Captain King had been informed at Canton, that, in the public prints, which had la&s;t arrived from Great Britain, mention was made of in&s;tructions having been found on board all the French &s;hips of war, that had been taken in Europe, importing, that their commanders, if they &s;hould happen to fall in with the &s;hips which had &s;ailed from England under the command of Captain Cook, &s;hould &s;uf|fer them to proceed unmole&s;ted on their voyage. It was al&s;o reported, that the American Congre&s;s had given &s;imilar orders to the ve&s;&s;els employed in their &s;ervice. This intelligence being further confirmed by the private letters of &s;ome of the &s;upercargoes, Captain Gore deemed it incum|bent on him, in return for the liberal exceptions which our enemies had made in our favour, to refrain from embracing any opportunities of capture, which the&s;e might afford, and to main|tain the &s;tricte&s;t neutrality during the whole of his voyage.</P>
<P><PB N="255" REF="030274_1544_0FE57B09AEFFA978">Having got under &s;ail, about two o'clock in the afternoon, the Re&s;olution &s;aluted the fort of Macao with eleven guns, and the &s;alutation was returned with an equal number. The wind fail|ing at five, the &s;hip mi&s;&s;ed &s;tays, and drove into &s;hallow water; but an anchor being quickly car|ried out, &s;he was hauled off without &s;u&s;taining any damage.</P>
<P>The calm continuing, we were under the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of warping out into the entrance of the Typa, which we gained by eight in the evening, and remained there till nine o'clock the follow|ing morning; when, being a&s;&s;i&s;ted by a fre&s;h ea&s;terly breeze, we &s;tood to the &s;outh between Wungboo and Potoe. At twelve a Swedi&s;h ve&s;|&s;el &s;aluted us as &s;he pa&s;&s;ed us on her way to Europe. At four in the afternoon, the Ladrone was about two leagues di&s;tant in an ea&s;tern di|rection.</P>
<P>We now &s;teered &s;outh half ea&s;t, having a fre&s;h breeze from the ea&s;t-north-ea&s;t point, without any remarkable occurrence, till the 15th at noon; at which time, our latitude being 18&deg; 57&prime;, and our longitude 114&deg; 13&prime; and the wind &s;hifting to the north, we directed our cour&s;e rather more to the ea&s;tward, with a view of &s;triking &s;oundings over the Macclesfield bank. This we accom|pli&s;hed on the 16th, at eight o'clock in the even|ing, and found that the depth of water was fifty fathoms, over a bottom con&s;i&s;ting of white &s;and
<PB N="256" REF="030274_1545_0FE57AD2667B8060">
and &s;hells. We judge this part of the Maccles|field &s;hoals to be in the latitude of 25&deg; 51&prime;, and the longitude of 114&deg; 20&prime;; which computation exactly coincides with the po&s;ition a&s;&s;igned in Mr. Dalrymple's map, who&s;e general accuracy was confirmed, in this in&s;tance, by many lunar ob&s;ervations. The variation was found, in the forenoon, to be 39&prime; we&s;t.</P>
<P>We had &s;trong gales from the ea&s;t by north, on the 17th, with a rough turbulent &s;ea, and gloomy weather. On the &s;ucceeding day, the &s;ea continuing to run high, and the wind to blow with violence, we changed our cour&s;e to &s;outh-we&s;t by &s;outh; and, at twelve o'clock, being in the longitude 112&deg;, and the latitude of 12&deg; 34&prime;, we began to &s;teer mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e to the we&s;tward for Pulo Sapata, of which we had &s;ight on the 19th, about four in the afternoon. It was, at that time, twelve or fourteen miles di&s;tant, bearing north-we&s;t by we&s;t.</P>
<P>This i&s;land, which is denominated <HI>Sapata,</HI> from its re&s;embling a &s;hoe in figure, is &s;mall, ele|vated, and unfertile. According to our ob&s;erva|tions, it is &s;ituated in the latitude of 10&deg; 4&prime; north, and the longitude of 109&deg; 10&prime; ea&s;t.</P>
<P>The fury of the gale was now &s;o much aug|mented, and the &s;ea ran &s;o high, that we were obliged to clo&s;e-reef the top-&s;ails. Our &s;hips during the three la&s;t days, had out-run their reckoning at the rate of twenty miles in a day;
<PB N="257" REF="030274_1546_0FE57A6D5555D678">
and, as this could not be wholly attributed to the effects of a following &s;ea, we partly a&s;cribed it to a current, which, according to Captain King's calculation, had &s;et, between the noon of the 19th, and the noon of the 20th, forty-two miles to the &s;outh &s;outh-we&s;tward; and is taken into the account in fixing the po&s;ition of Sapata.</P>
<P>Having pa&s;&s;ed this i&s;land, we &s;tood to the we&s;t|ward, and, at midnight, &s;ounded, and found a bottom of fine &s;and at the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> fathoms. The violence of the wind abating in the morning of the 20th, we let out the reefs, and directed our cour&s;e to the we&s;t by &s;outh for Pulo Condore. Our latitude at noon was 8&deg; 46&prime; north, and our longitude 106&deg; 45&prime; ea&s;t; and, between twelve and one, we had a view of that i&s;land, in a we&s;tern direction.</P>
<P>At four o'clock in the afternoon, the extremes of Pulo Condore and the i&s;lands that are &s;ituated off it, bore &s;outh-ea&s;t and &s;outh-we&s;t by we&s;t; and our di&s;tance from the neare&s;t i&s;lands was a|bout two miles. We &s;ailed to the northward of the i&s;lands, and &s;tood towards a harbour at the &s;outh-we&s;t end of Condore, which, having its entrance from the north-we&s;t, affords the be&s;t &s;helter during the north-ea&s;t mon&s;oon. At &s;ix o'clock we anchored in &s;ix fathoms water, with the be&s;t bower; and the Di&s;covery was kept &s;teady with a &s;tream anchor and cable towards the &s;outh-ea&s;t. When moored, the extremities of
<PB N="258" REF="030274_1547_0FE57B0B3A79F498">
the entrance of the harbour bore we&s;t-north-we&s;t a quarter we&s;t, and north by we&s;t; the opening at the upper end bore &s;outh-ea&s;t by ea&s;t three quarters ea&s;t; and we were about two furlong di&s;tant from the neare&s;t part of the &s;hore.</P>
<P>We had no &s;ooner let go our anchors, than Captain Gore fired a gun, with a view of giving the inhabitants notice of our arrival, and drawing them towards the &s;hore; but it had no effect. Early the next morning parties were di&s;patched to cut wood, as Captain Gore's principal motive for touching at this i&s;land was to &s;upply the &s;hips with that article. During the afternoon a &s;udden gu&s;t of wind broke the &s;tream-cable, by which the Di&s;|covery rode, and obliged her people to moor with the bower anchors.</P>
<P>As none of the i&s;landers had yet made their appearance, notwith&s;tanding the firing of a &s;econd gun, Captain Gore thought it advi&s;eable to go a&s;hore in &s;earch of them, that we might lo&s;e no time in opening a traffic for &s;uch provi&s;ions as the place could furni&s;h us with. For this purpo&s;e, he de&s;ired Captain King to accompany him in the morning of the 22d: and, as the wind, at that time blew violently from the ea&s;tward, they did not think it con&s;i&s;tent with prudence to coa&s;t in their boats to the town, which &s;tands on the ea&s;|tern &s;ide of the i&s;land, but rowed round the nor|thern point of the harbour.</P>
<P><PB N="259" REF="030274_1548_0FE57AFF282A1AC0">They had proceeded along the &s;hore for the &s;pace of about two miles, when perceiving a road that led into a wood, they l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nded. Here Captain King left Captain Gore, and, attended by a mid|&s;hipman, and four armed &s;ailors, pur&s;ued the path, which appeared to point directly acro&s;s the i&s;land. They pa&s;&s;ed through a thick wood, up a hill of con&s;iderable &s;teepne&s;s, to the di&s;tance of a mile, when, after they had de&s;cended through a wood of equal extent, on the other &s;ide, they ar|rived in an open, level, &s;andy country, inter|&s;per&s;ed with groves of cabbage-palm and cocoa-nut trees, and cultivated &s;pots of tobacco and rice.</P>
<P>Here they de&s;cried two huts, &s;ituate on the extremity of the wood, to which they directed their march. Before they came up to the&s;e habi|tations, they were ob&s;erved by two men, who in&s;tantaneou&s;ly ran away from them, notwith|&s;tanding all the peaceable and &s;upplicating ge&s;|tures our party could devi&s;e. On reaching the huts, Captain King, apprehending that the fight of &s;o many armed men might terrify the natives, commanded his attendants to remain without, while he entered and reconnoitred alone. In one of the huts he found an elderly man, who was in a great con&s;ternation, and was preparing to retire with the mo&s;t valuable of his effects that he was able to carry. Mr. King, however, found means, in a very &s;hort time, &s;o entirely to di&s;&s;ipate his
<PB N="260" REF="030274_1549_0FE57ADDDF18AD98">
terrors, that he came out, and called to the two i&s;landers, who were running away, to return.</P>
<P>Captain King and the old man now quickly came to a perfect under&s;tanding. A few &s;igns, particularly that &s;ignificant one of &s;hewing a handfull of dollars, and then pointing to a herd of buffa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oes, as well as to the fowls that were run|ning in con&s;iderable numbers about the huts, left him under no doubts with re&s;pect to the real ob|jects of the Captain's vi&s;it. He immediately pointed to the &s;pot where the town was &s;ituated and made Mr. King comprehend, that, by repair|ing thither, all his nece&s;&s;ities would be &s;up|plied.</P>
<P>By this time the two fugitives had returned, and one of them was ordered by the old man to conduct our party to the town, as &s;oon as an ob|&s;tacle, of which they were not aware, &s;hould be removed. On their fir&s;t leaving the wood, a herd of buffaloes, con&s;i&s;ting of at lea&s;t twenty, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">an towards them, to&s;&s;ing up their heads, &s;nuffing the air, and making a hideous roaring. They had followed our people to the huts, and now remained at a &s;mall di&s;tance drawn up in a body; and the old man &s;ignified to Captain King, that it would be extremely dangerous for our party to move, till the buffaloes had been driven into the woods: but the&s;e animals had become &s;o enraged at the &s;ight of them, that this was not accom|pli&s;hed without &s;ome difficulty. The men, in|deed,
<PB N="261" REF="030274_1550_0FE57A7D14DAAF20">
were unable to effect it; but, to the &s;ur|pri&s;e of Captain King and his companions, they called &s;ome little boys to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, who &s;peedily drove the animals out of &s;ight. It after|wards appeared, that, in driving the buffaloes, and &s;ecuring them, which is done by putting a rope through a hole made in their no&s;trils, it was cu&s;tomary to employ little boys, who, at times when the men would not venture to approach them, could &s;troke and handle them with im|punity.</P>
<P>After the buffaloes had been driven off, our party were conducted to the town, which was about a mile di&s;tant; the road to it lying through a deep whiti&s;h &s;and. It &s;tands near the &s;ea-&s;ide, at the bottom of a retired bay, which affords good &s;helter during the prevalence of the &s;outh-we&s;t mon&s;oon.</P>
<P>This town is compo&s;ed of between twenty and thirty hou&s;es, which are built contiguous to each other. Be&s;ides the&s;e, there are &s;ix or &s;even others di&s;per&s;ed about the beach. The roof, the two ends, and the &s;ide that fronts the country, are con&s;tructed of reeds in a neat manner. The oppo&s;ite &s;ide which faces the &s;ea, is perfectly open; but the inhabitants, by means of a kind of &s;creens made of bamboo, can exclude or admit as much of the air and &s;un as they think proper. There are likewi&s;e other large &s;creens, or parti|tions, which &s;erve to divide, as occa&s;ion may
<PB N="262" REF="030274_1551_0FE57B1E8469FD58">
require, the &s;ingle room, of which the habita|tion, properly &s;peaking, con&s;i&s;ts into &s;eperate apartments.</P>
<P>The i&s;lander who acted as a guide to our party, conducted them to the large&s;t hou&s;e in the town, belonging to the chief, or (as the natives &s;tyled him) the Captain. At each extremity of this hou&s;e was a room, &s;eparated by a partition of reeds from the middle &s;pace, which was un|enclo&s;ed on either &s;ide, and was furni&s;hed with partition &s;creens like the others. There was al&s;o a penthou&s;e, which projected to the di&s;tance of four or five feet from the roof, and ran the whole length on each &s;ide. Some Chine&s;e paintings, re|pre&s;enting per&s;ons of both &s;exes in ludicrous atti|tudes, were hung at each end of the middle room. In this apartment our people were reque&s;ted to &s;eat them&s;elves on mats, and <HI>betel</HI> was pre&s;ented to them.</P>
<P>Captain King, by producing money, and point|ing at different objects that were in &s;ight, met with no difficulty in making one of the company, who &s;eemed to be the principal per&s;on among them, comprehend the chief de&s;ign of his vi&s;it; and as readily under&s;tood from him, that the Chief, or Captain, was, at this time, ab&s;ent, but would quickly return; and that no purcha&s;e of any kind could be made without his concurrence and ap|probation.</P>
<P><PB N="263" REF="030274_1552_0FE57B4CC457ADD8">Our party took advantage of the opportunity afforded them by this circum&s;tance, to walk about the town: and did not omit &s;earching, though ineffectually, for the remains of a fort, which &s;ome of our countrymen had built in the year 1702, near the &s;pot they were now upon <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Engli&s;h &s;ettled on this i&s;land in 1702, and brought with them a party of Maca&s;&s;er &s;oldiers, who were hired to contribute their a&s;&s;i&s;tance in erecting a fort; but the pre&s;ident of the factory not fulfilling his en|gagement with them, they were determined upon revenge, and one night, took an opportunity of murdering all the Engli&s;h in the fort. Tho&s;e who were without the fort, hearing a noi&s;e, were greatly alarmed, and run|ning to their boats, narrowly e&s;caped with their lives to the Johore do|minions, where they met with very humane treatment. Some of the&s;e afterwards repaired to Benjar-Ma&s;&s;ean, in the i&s;land of B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rneo, for the purpo&s;e of forming a &s;ettlement.</NOTE>. On their return to the hou&s;e of the Captain, they were &s;orry to find, that he had not yet arrived, particularly as the time which had been fixed by Captain Gore, for their return to the boat, was nearly expired. The inhabitants de&s;ired them to protract their &s;tay, and even propo&s;ed their pa&s;|&s;ing the night there, offering to accommodate them in the be&s;t manner they were able.</P>
<P>Mr. King had ob&s;erved, when he was in the hou&s;e before, (and now remarked it the more) that the per&s;on above-mentioned frequently re|tired into one of the end rooms, where he con|tinued a &s;hort time, before he an&s;wered the in|terrogatories
<PB N="264" REF="030274_1553_0FE57B27E01B4CA0">
that were put to him. This in|duced Mr. King to &s;u&s;pect, that the Captain had been there the whole time, though for rea&s;ons with which he him&s;elf was be&s;t acquainted, he did not think proper to make his appearance. He was confirmed in his opinion, by being &s;top|ped as he attempted to enter the room. At length, it evidently appeared, that Mr. King's &s;u&s;picions were well founded; for, on his pre|paring to depart, the per&s;on who had pa&s;&s;ed in and out &s;o many times, came from the room with a paper in his hand, and gave it to him for his peru&s;al; and he was not a little &s;urpri&s;ed at finding it to be a kind of certificate, written in the French language, of which the following is a tran&s;lation.</P>

<P>Captain King returned the paper, with many prote&s;tations of our people being the Mandarin's
<PB N="265" REF="030274_1554_0FE57A5FB6A8DBE0">
good friends, and reque&s;ted he might be informed that they hoped he would do them the favour to pay them a vi&s;it on board the &s;hips, that they might convince him of it. They now took their leave, being, upon the whole, well &s;atisfied with what had happened, but full of conjectures with regard to this extraordinary French paper. Three of the inhabitants propo&s;ing to attend them back, they readily accepted the offer, and returned by the way they had come.</P>
<P>Captain Gore was extremely plea&s;ed at &s;eeing them again, for, as they had exceeded their ap|pointed time by almo&s;t an hour, he began to en|tertain apprehen&s;ions for their &s;afety, and was pre|paring to march after them. He and his party had, during Mr. King's ab&s;ence, been u&s;efully oc|cupied, in loading the boat with the cabbage-palm, which is very beautiful in this bay. The three guides were each pre&s;ented with a dollar, as a compen&s;ation for their trouble; and a bottle of rum for the mandarin was entru&s;ted to their care. One of them thought proper to accompany our people on board.</P>
<P>The Captains Gore and King rejoined the &s;hips at two o'clock in the afternoon; and &s;everal of our &s;hooting parties returned from the woods about the &s;ame time, having met with no great &s;ucce&s;s, though they had &s;een a con&s;iderable va|riety of birds and other animals, &s;ome of which
<PB N="266" REF="030274_1555_0FE57AD3EE068820">
will be noticed in the cour&s;e of the pre&s;ent chap|ter.</P>
<P>Six men, in a proa, rowed up to the &s;hips at five o'clock, from the upper end of the harbour; and one of them, who was a per&s;on of a decent appearance, introduced him&s;elf to Captain Gore with an ea&s;e and politene&s;s, which indicated that he had been accu&s;tomed to pa&s;s his time in other company than what Condore afforded. He brought with him the French certificate above tran&s;cribed, and gave us to under&s;tand, that he was the Mandarin mentioned in it. He could &s;peak a few Portugue&s;e words; but, as none of us had learned that language, we were under the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of having recour&s;e to a black man on board, who was acquainted with the Malayan tongue, which is the general language of the&s;e i&s;landers, and was under&s;tood by the Mandarin.</P>
<P>After &s;ome previous conver&s;ation, he informed us, that he profe&s;&s;ed the Chri&s;tian faith, and had been baptized by the appellation of Luco; that he had been &s;ent to this i&s;land in the preceding Augu&s;t, from Sai-gon, the capital of Cochin-China, and had waited, &s;ince that time, in ex|pectation of &s;ome French ve&s;&s;els, which he was to conduct to a &s;afe harbour, on the coa&s;t of Cochin-China, not above one day's &s;ail from Condore. We told him that we were not of the French nation, but of the Engli&s;h; and a&s;ked
<PB N="267" REF="030274_1556_0FE57A69E2340EC8">
him, whether he had not heard, that tho&s;e two kingdoms were now at war with each other. He replied in the affirmative; but intimated to us at the &s;ame time, that it was a matter of indifference to him to what nation the &s;hips he was directed to wait for appertained, provided their object was to enter into traffic with the people of Cochin-China.</P>
<P>He now produced another paper, which he re|que&s;ted us to peru&s;e. This was a letter &s;ealed up, and addre&s;&s;ed "To the Captains of any European &s;hips that may touch at Condore:" Though we &s;uppo&s;ed, that this letter was particularly intended for French ve&s;&s;els, yet, as the direction compre|hended all European Captains, and at Luco was de&s;irous of our reading it, we broke the &s;eal, and perceived that it was written by the &s;ame bi&s;hop who wrote the certificate.</P>
<P>Its contents were to the following purport&punc; "That he had rea&s;on to expect, by &s;ome intelli|gence lately received from Europe, that a &s;hip would, in a &s;hort time, come to Cochin-China; in con&s;equence of which news, he had prevailed on the court to di&s;patch a Mandarin (the bearer) to Pulo Condore, to wait its arrival: that if the ve&s;&s;el &s;hould touch there, the Captain might either &s;end to him, by the bearer of this letter, an account of his having arrived or tru&s;t him&s;elf to the direction of the Mandarin, who would pilot the &s;hip into a commodious port in Cochin-China,
<PB N="268" REF="030274_1557_0FE57B0D25C0FE48">
not exceeding a day's &s;ail from Pulo Con|dore: that if he &s;hould he inclined to continue at this i&s;land till the return of the me&s;&s;enger, proper interpreters &s;hould be &s;ent back, and any other a&s;&s;i&s;tance, which might be pointed out in a letter, &s;hould be furni&s;hed; that there was no occa&s;ion for being more particular, of which the com|mander him&s;elf mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible." This epi&s;tle had the &s;ame date with the certificate, and was re|turned to Luco, without our taking any copy of it.</P>
<P>From the whole of the Mandarin's conver|&s;ation, as well as from this letter, we had little doubt that the ve&s;&s;el he expected was a French one. We found, at the &s;ame time, that he was de&s;irous of not lo&s;ing his errand, and was not un|willing to become our pilot. We could not di&s;|cover from him the preci&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s which the &s;hip he was waiting for de&s;igned to pro&s;ecute in Cochin-China. The black, indeed, who acted as our interpreter on this occa&s;ion, was exceed|ingly dull and &s;tupid: we &s;hould, therefore, be &s;orry, having &s;uch imperfect means of informa|tion, to run the hazard of mi&s;leading our readers by any of our own conjectures, relative to the object of the Mandarin's vi&s;it to Pulo Condore. We &s;hall only add, that he acquainted us, that the French ve&s;&s;els might perhaps have touched at Tirnon, and from thence &s;ail to Cochin-China; and, as no intelligence of them had reached him,
<PB N="269" REF="030274_1558_0FE57ABD8068CC20">
he imagined that this was mo&s;t likely to have been the ca&s;e.</P>
<P>Captain Gore afterwards inquired, what &s;upplies could be procured from this i&s;land. Luco re|plied, that there, were two buffaloes belonging to him, which were at our &s;ervice; and that there were con&s;iderable numbers of tho&s;e animals on the i&s;land, which might be purcha&s;ed for four or five dollars each; but Captain Gore thinking that &s;um very moderate, and appearing inclined to give a much greater for them, the price was &s;peedily aug|mented to &s;even or eight dollars.</P>
<P>On the 23d, early in the morning, the launches of both our &s;hips were di&s;patched to the town, to bring away the buffaloes which we had given orders for the purcha&s;e of; but they were under the nece&s;&s;ity of waiting till it was high water, not being able, at any other time to make their way through the opening at the head of the har|bour. Upon their arrival at the town, the &s;urf broke again&s;t the beach with &s;uch fury, that it was not without the greate&s;t difficulty that each of the launches brought a buffaloe on board in the evening, and the officers employed in this &s;ervice declared it as their opinion, that, not only from the violence of the &s;urf, but al&s;o from the fero&s;ity of the buffaloes, it would be highly im|prudent to attempt to bring off any more this way.</P>
<P><PB N="270" REF="030274_1559_0FE57A8835EF4810">We had procured eight of the&s;e animals, and were now at a lo&s;s, in what manner we &s;hould get them on board. We could not conveniently kill more than ju&s;t &s;erved for one day's con&s;umption, as, in the climate in which we now were, meat would not keep till the next day. After con&s;ult|ing with the Mandarin on this point, it was de|termined that the remainder of the buffaloes &s;hould be driven through the wood, and over the hill down to the bay, where out two Captains had landed the preceding day; which being &s;heltered from the wind, was con&s;equently more free from &s;urf.</P>
<P>This plan was accordingly executed; but the intractablene&s;s and amazing &s;trength of the ani|mals rendered it a &s;low and difficult operation. The mode of conducting them was, by putting ropes through their no&s;trils, and round their horns; but when they were once enraged at the &s;ight of our people, they became &s;o furious, that they &s;ometimes tore a&s;under the cartilage of the no&s;tril, through which the ropes pa&s;&s;ed, and &s;et them&s;elves at liberty; at other times, they broke the trees, to which it was frequently found ne|ce&s;&s;ary to fa&s;ten them. On &s;uch occa&s;ions, all the endeavours of our men, for the recovery of them, would have been un&s;ucce&s;sful without the aid of &s;ome little boys, whom the buffaloes would &s;uffer to approach them, and by who&s;e puerile managements their rage was quickly appea&s;ed:
<PB N="271" REF="030274_1560_0FE57AD5DB9EF410">
and when, at length, they had been brought up to the beach, it was by their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, in twi&s;ting ropes about their legs, in the manner they were directed, that our people were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">bled to throw them down, and, by that means, to get them into the boats.</P>
<P>A circum&s;tance relative to the&s;e animals, which we con&s;idered as no le&s;s &s;ingular than their gen|tlene&s;s towards children, and &s;eeming affection for them, was, that they had not been a whole day on board, before they were as tame as po&s;|&s;ible. Captain King kept two of them, one of each &s;ex, for a con&s;iderable time, which became great favorites with the &s;eamen. Thinking that a breed of animals of &s;uch magnitude and &s;trength, &s;ome of which weighed, when dre&s;&s;ed, &s;even hun|dred pounds, would be an acqui&s;ition of &s;ome value, he intended to have brought them with him to England; but that de&s;ign was fru&s;trated by an incurable hurt which one of them received at &s;ea.</P>
<P>The buffaloes were not all brought on board before the 28th. We had no rea&s;on, however, to regret the time occupied in this &s;ervice, &s;ince in that interval, two wells of excellent water had been found, in con&s;equence of which di&s;covery, part of the companies of both &s;hips had been employed in providing a competent &s;upply of it. We likewi&s;e procured a quantity of wood: &s;o that a &s;horter &s;tay would be requi&s;ite, in the
<PB N="272" REF="030274_1561_0FE57ABF055D0818">
Straits of Sunda, for recruiting our &s;tock of the nece&s;&s;ary articles. A party had al&s;o been engaged in drawing the &s;eine, at the head of the harbour, where they caught a great number of good fi&s;h; and another party had been bu&s;ied in cutting down the cabbage-palm, which was boiled and &s;erved out with the meat. Be&s;ides, as we obtained but an incon&s;iderable &s;upply of cordage at Macao, the repairs of our rigging had become an object of con&s;tant attention, and demanded all the time we could conveniently &s;pare.</P>
<P>Pulo Condore is elevated and mountainous, and is encompa&s;&s;ed by &s;everal i&s;lands of inferior extent, &s;ome of which are about two miles di&s;|tant, and others le&s;s than one mile. Its name &s;ignifies the i&s;land of Calaba&s;hes, being derived from two Malay words, <HI>Pulo</HI> implying an i&s;land, and <HI>Condore</HI> a Calaba&s;h, great quantities of which fruit are here produced. It is of a &s;emi-circular form, and extends &s;even or eight miles from the mo&s;t &s;outherly point, in the direction of north-ea&s;t. Its breadth, in any part, does not exceed two miles.</P>
<P>From the we&s;ternmo&s;t extreme, the land, for the &s;pace of about four miles, trends to the &s;outh-ea&s;tward; and oppo&s;ite this part of the coa&s;t &s;tands an i&s;land, called, by Mon&s;ieur D' Apres, in the <HI>Neptune Oriental,</HI> Little Condore, which extends two miles in a &s;imilar direction. This &s;ituation of the two i&s;lands affords a &s;ecure and
<PB N="273" REF="030274_1562_0FE57A912959FBB8">
convenient harbour, the entrance into which is from the north-we&s;tward. The di&s;tance of the two oppo&s;ite coa&s;ts from each other is about three quarters of a mile, exclu&s;ive of a border of coral rock, running along each &s;ide, and &s;tretching about a hundred yards from the &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ore.</P>
<P>The anchorage in this harbour is very good, the depth of water being from five to eleven fathoms; but the bottom is &s;o &s;oft and clayey, that we meet with con&s;iderable difficulty in weigh|ing our anchors. There is &s;hallow water towards the bottom of the harbour, for the extent of about half a mile, beyond which the two i&s;lands make &s;o near an approach to each other, that they leave only a pa&s;&s;age at high water for boats. The mo&s;t commodious watering-place is at a beach on the ea&s;tern &s;ide, where we found a &s;mall &s;tream that &s;upplied us with fourteen or fifteen tons of water in a day.</P>
<P>With regard both to animal and vegetable pro|ductions, Pulo Condore is greatly improved &s;ince the time it was vi&s;ited by Dampier. Nei|ther that navigator, nor the compiler of the Ea&s;t-India Directory, mention any other quadrupeds than hogs, (which are &s;aid to be extremely &s;carce) lizards, and guanoes; and the latter a&s;&s;erts, up|on the authority of Mon&s;ieur Dedier, a French engineer, who &s;urveyed this i&s;land about the year 1720, that none of tho&s;e fruits and e&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ulent plants, which are &s;o frequently met with in the
<PB N="274" REF="030274_1563_0FE57B169CAB3FA8">
other parts of India, are to be found here, ex|cept <HI>chibbols</HI> (a &s;mall &s;ort of onion) water-melons, little black beans, &s;mall gourds, and a few pota|toes. At pre&s;ent, be&s;ides the buffaloes, of which animals we were informed there were &s;everal large herds, we purcha&s;ed from the inhabitants &s;ome remarkably fine hogs, of the Chine&s;e breed. They brought us three or four of a wild &s;pecies; and our &s;port&s;men affirmed, that they perceived their tracks in many parts of the woods, which likewi&s;e abounded with monkies and &s;quirrels; the&s;e, however, were &s;o &s;hy, that it was difficult to &s;hoot them.</P>
<P>One &s;pecies of the &s;quirrel, here ob&s;erved, was of a beautiful glo&s;&s;y black; and another &s;ort had brown and white &s;tripes. This is denomi|nated the flying &s;quirrel, from its being furni&s;hed with a thin membrane, re&s;embling the wing of a bat, which extends on each &s;ide of the belly, from the neck to the thighs, and, on the animal's &s;tretching out its legs, &s;preads, and enables it to fly from one tree to another at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance. Great numbers of lizards were &s;een; but we do not know that any of our people &s;aw the guano, or another animal which Dampier <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dampier's Voyages, Vol. I. p. 392.</NOTE> has de&s;cribed as re&s;embling the guano, though far &s;uperior in &s;ize.</P>
<P>Among the vegetable improvements of Pulo Condore, may be reckoned the fields of rice
<PB N="275" REF="030274_1564_0FE57ACA6AA19300">
that were ob&s;erved: cocoa-nuts, pomegranates, oranges, &s;haddocks, plantains, and various &s;orts of pompious, were al&s;o found here; though, ex|cept the &s;haddocks and plaintains, in no great quantities.</P>
<P>From what we have already mentioned, re|&s;pecting the Bi&s;hop of Adran&punc; it is probable, that the i&s;land is indebted to the French for the&s;e im|provements, which were introduced, perhaps, for the purpo&s;e of rendering it a more convenient place of refre&s;hment for any of their ve&s;&s;els that may be de&s;tined for Cochin-China or Cambodia. Should they have formed, or intend to form any &s;ettlement in tho&s;e regions, it is undoubtedly well &s;ituated for that purpo&s;e, as well as for annoying the commerce of their enemies, in time of war.</P>
<P>Though the woods are plentifully &s;tocked with the feathered game, our &s;port&s;men had very little &s;ucce&s;s in their pur&s;uit of them. One of our gen|tlemen was &s;o fortunate as to &s;hoot a wild hen; and all our &s;hooting parties were unanimous in declaring, that they heard the crowings of the cocks on every &s;ide, which they &s;aid re&s;embled that of our common cock, but was more &s;hrill. They ob&s;erved &s;everal of them on the wing, which, however, were extremely &s;hy. The hen that was &s;hot was of a &s;peckled hue, and of the &s;ame &s;hape with a full-grown pullet of this country, though &s;omewhat inferior in magnitude. Mon&s;ieur Sonnerat has, in a long di&s;&s;ertation,
<PB N="276" REF="030274_1565_0FE57AAAE5C43298">
endeavoured to prove, that he was the fir&s;t per&s;on who a&s;certained the country to which this u&s;eful and beautiful bird belongs, and denies that Dam|pier met with it at this i&s;land.</P>
<P>The land near the harbour is a continued lofty hill, richly adorned, from the &s;ummit to the edge of the water, with a great variety of fine high trees. Among others, we &s;aw that which is called by Dampier the tar-tree; but perceived none that were tapped, in the manner de&s;cribed by him.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of Pulo Condore, who are fugitives from Cochin-China and Cambodia, are not numerous. They are very &s;warthy in their complexion, of a &s;hort &s;tature, and of a weak un|healthy a&s;pect; and, as far as we had an opportu|nity of judging, of a gentle di&s;po&s;ition.</P>
<P>We continued at this i&s;land till Friday the 28th of January; and, when the Mandarin took his leave of us, Captain Gore gave him, at his reque&s;t, a letter of recommendation to the commanders of any other ve&s;&s;els that might put in here. He al&s;o be&s;towed on him a hand&s;ome pre&s;ent, and gave him a letter for the Bi&s;hop of Adran, to|gether with a tele&s;cope, which he de&s;ired might be pre&s;ented to him as a compliment for the fa|vours we had received, through his means, at Pu|lo Condore.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>WE weighed anchor on the 28th, and had no &s;ooner cleared the harbour, than we &s;tood to the &s;outh-&s;outh-we&s;t for Pulo Timoan. On Sunday the 30th, at twelve o'clock, our lati|tude,
<PB N="279" REF="030274_1568_0FE57AC0E89A4598">
by ob&s;ervation, being 5&deg; north, and our lon|gitude 104&deg; 45&prime; ea&s;t, we changed our cour&s;e to &s;outh three quarters we&s;t, having a gentle north-ea&s;terly breeze, attended with fair weather.</P>
<P>The next morning, at two o'clock, our depth of water was forty-five fathoms, over a bottom of fine white &s;and. The latitude, at this time, was 4&deg; 4&prime; north, the longitude 104&deg; 29&prime; ea&s;t, and the variation of the compa&s;s 31&prime; ea&s;t. We had &s;ight of Pulo Timoan at one in the afternoon; and, at three, it was nine or ten miles di&s;tant, bearing &s;outh-&s;outh-we&s;t three quarters we&s;t. This i&s;land is high and well furni&s;hed with wood, and has &s;e|veral &s;mall i&s;les lying off it to the we&s;t.</P>
<P>At five o'clock, Pulo Pui&s;&s;ang was &s;een, in the direction of &s;outh by ea&s;t three quarters ea&s;t; and, at nine, the weather being foggy, and hav|ing, from the effect of &s;ome current, out-run our reckoning, we were clo&s;e upon Pulo Aor, in the latitude of 2&deg; 46&prime; north, and the longitude of 104&deg; 37&prime; ea&s;t, before we were perfectly aware of it; in con&s;equence of which we hauled the wind to the ea&s;t-&s;outh-ea&s;tward. This cour&s;e we pro&s;e|cuted till midnight, and then &s;teered &s;outh-&s;outh ea&s;t for the Straits of Banca.</P>
<P>At noon, on the fir&s;t day of February, the la|titude was 1&deg; 20&prime; north, and the longitude, de|duced from a con&s;iderable number of lunar ob|&s;ervations, was 105&deg; ea&s;t. We now &s;tood to the &s;outh by ea&s;t; and towards &s;un-&s;et, the weather
<PB N="280" REF="030274_1569_0FE57A9FCBF61A70">
being clear and fine, we had a view of Pulo-Pan|jang; the body of the i&s;land bearing we&s;t-north-we&s;t, and the little i&s;lands, &s;ituated to the &s;outh-ea&s;t of it, we&s;t half &s;outh, at the di&s;tance of &s;even leagues. Our latitude, at the &s;ame time, was 53&prime; north.</P>
<P>On Wedne&s;day the 2d, at eight o'clock in the morning, we tried for &s;oundings, continuing the &s;ame practice every hour, till we had pa&s;&s;ed the Straits of Sunda, and &s;truck ground with twenty-three fathoms of line. At twelve, when our la|titude by ob&s;ervation, was 22&prime; &s;outh, our longi|tude 105&deg; 15&prime; ea&s;t, and our depth of water twenty fathoms, we arrived in &s;ight of the &s;mall i&s;lands known by the name of Dominis, lying off the ea&s;tern part of Lingen, and bearing from north 62&deg; we&s;t to north 800 we&s;t, at the di&s;tance of fif|teen or &s;ixteen miles.</P>
<P>At this time we pa&s;&s;ed a great quantity of wood, drifting on the water; and, at one o'clock in the afternoon, Pulo Taya made its appearance, in the direction of &s;outh-we&s;t by we&s;t, &s;even leagues di&s;tant. It is a &s;mall elevated i&s;land, with two round peaks, and two detached rocks to the northward of it. When we were abrea&s;t of this i&s;land, our &s;oundings were fifteen fathoms. We ob&s;erved, during this and the preceding day, con|&s;iderable quantities of a &s;cum or &s;pawn of a reddi&s;h hue, floating on the &s;ea, in a &s;outhern direction.</P>
<P><PB N="281" REF="030274_1570_0FE57AE803F25C58">We had &s;ight of the Three I&s;lands at day-break on the 3d; and not long afterwards, &s;aw Mo|nopin Hill, in the i&s;land of Banca. At twelve o'clock, this hill, which forms the north-ea&s;tern point of the entrance of the Straits of Banca, was &s;ix leagues di&s;tant, bearing &s;outh-ea&s;t half &s;outh. Our depth of water, at that time, was &s;eventeen fathoms; our latitude, by ob&s;ervation, 1&deg; 48&prime; &s;outh; our longitude 105&deg; 3&prime; ea&s;t; and there was no perceptible variation in the com|pa&s;s. Having got to the we&s;t of the &s;hoal, named Frederic Endric, we entered the &s;traits between two and three, and bore away towards the &s;outh; and, in the cour&s;e of the afternoon, Monopin Hill bearing due ea&s;t, we a&s;certained its latitude to be 2&deg; 3&prime; &s;outh, and its longitude 105&deg; 18&prime; ea&s;t.</P>
<P>About nine in the evening, a boat came off from the Banca &s;hore; but after the crew had rowed round the &s;hips, they immediately went away. We hailed them, in the Malayan tongue, to come on board, but no an&s;wer was returned. At midnight, finding that there was &s;trong tide again&s;t us, we let go our anchors in twelve fa|thoms water, Monopin Hill bearing north 29&deg; we&s;t.</P>
<P>In the morning of the 4th, after meeting with &s;ome difficulty in weighing our anchors, by rea|&s;on of the &s;tiff tenacious quality of the ground, we proceeded down the &s;traits with the tide, the
<PB N="282" REF="030274_1571_0FE57B389B6DC638">
incon&s;iderable wind we had from the north dying away as the day advanced. At twelve o'clock the tide beginning to make again&s;t us, and there being a perfect calm, we ca&s;t anchor in thirteen fathoms water, at the di&s;tance of about one league from what is denominated the Third Point, on the Sumatra &s;hore; Monopin Hill bearing north 54&deg; we&s;t, and our latitude being 2&deg; 22&prime; &s;outh, longitude 105&deg; 38&prime; ea&s;t.</P>
<P>We weighed at three in the afternoon, and continued our cour&s;e through the &s;traits with a gentle breeze. At eight o'clock, we were abrea&s;t of the Second Point, which we pa&s;&s;ed within two miles, in &s;eventeen fathoms water; a &s;ufficient proof, that ve&s;&s;els may border upon this point with &s;afety. About midnight, we anchored again, on account of the tide, in thirteen fathoms; Mount Permi&s;&s;ang, in the i&s;land of Banca, being in the direction of north 7&deg; ea&s;t, and the fir&s;t Point bearing &s;outh 54&deg; ea&s;t, at the di&s;tance of nine or ten miles.</P>
<P>The next morning we weighed anchor, and &s;tood on to the &s;outh-ea&s;tward, and at ten o'clock, we pa&s;&s;ed a &s;mall &s;hoal, &s;ituated in a line with the i&s;land of Lu&s;epara and the Fir&s;t Point, and five miles di&s;tant from the latter. At twelve, Lu&s;epara bearing &s;outh 57&deg; &frac12; ea&s;t, at the di&s;tance of four miles, its latitude was determined by us to be 3&deg; 10&prime; &frac12; &s;outh, and its longitude 106&deg; 15&prime; ea&s;t. The difference of longitude between the
<PB N="283" REF="030274_1572_0FE57B3717C18B00">
i&s;land of Lu&s;epara, which &s;tands in the &s;outhern entrance of the Straits of Banca, and Monopin Hill, which forms one &s;ide of the northern en|trance, we found to be 55&prime;.</P>
<P>In pa&s;&s;ing the&s;e &s;traits, &s;hips may make a nearer approach to the coa&s;t of Sumatra than to that of Banca. There are ten, eleven, twelve, or thir|teen fathoms, free from &s;hoals and rocks, at the di&s;tance of two or three miles from the coa&s;t; the lead, however, is the mo&s;t certain guide. The country, even to the edge of the water, is covered with wood; and the &s;hores are &s;o low, that the land is overflowed by the &s;ea, which wa&s;hes the trunks of the trees. To this flat and mar&s;hy &s;ituation of the Sumatra &s;hore, may be a&s;cribed tho&s;e thick fogs and vapours, which were every morning perceived by us, not without &s;ome degree of dread and horror, to hang over the i&s;land, till they were di&s;&s;ipated by the &s;olar rays. The &s;hores of Banca are much bolder, and the inland country ri&s;es to a moderate elevation, and &s;eems to abound with wood. We frequently ob|&s;erved fires on this i&s;land during the night; but none on the oppo&s;ite coa&s;t. The tide runs at the rate of between two and three miles an hour through the &s;traits.</P>
<P>On Sunday the 6th, in the morning, we pa&s;&s;ed to the we&s;t of Lu&s;epara, at the di&s;tance of four or five miles; our &s;oundings, in general, being five or &s;ix fathoms, and never le&s;s than four. We
<PB N="284" REF="030274_1573_0FE57B4049CDA4C0">
afterwards &s;tood to the &s;outh by ea&s;t; and having increa&s;ed our depth of water to &s;even fathoms, and brought Lu&s;epara to bear due north, we changed our cour&s;e to &s;outh by we&s;t, frequently making u&s;e of the lead, and hauling out a little, whenever we happened to &s;hoal our water. We &s;till found the &s;oundings on the &s;ide of Sumatra to be regular, and &s;hoaling gradually, as we came nearer to the &s;hore.</P>
<P>At five o'clock in the afternoon, we de&s;cried the Si&s;ters, in the direction of &s;outh by we&s;t half we&s;t; and, at &s;even, we ca&s;t anchor in ten fathoms water, near three leagues to the north|ward of tho&s;e i&s;lands. The weather was clo&s;e and fultry, with light winds, blowing, for the mo&s;t part, from the north-we&s;t, but occa&s;ionally &s;hift|ing round to the north-ea&s;t; and in the cour&s;e of the night, much lightning was ob&s;erved over Su|matra.</P>
<P>The following morning, at five, we weighed and made &s;ail; and in three hours afterwards we were clo&s;e in with the Si&s;ters. The&s;e are two i&s;lands of very &s;mall extent, plentifully &s;tocked with wood, &s;ituated in the latitude of 5&deg; &s;outh, and the longitude of 106&deg; 12&prime; ea&s;t, nearly &s;outh and north from each other, and encompa&s;&s;ed by a reef of coral rocks; the whole circuit of which is four or five miles. At twelve o'clock, we had &s;ight of the i&s;land of Java; the north-we&s;tern extreme of which (Cape St. Nicholas) bore &s;outh;
<PB N="285" REF="030274_1574_0FE57B4EADB76650">
North I&s;land, near the &s;hore of Sumatra, &s;outh 27&deg; we&s;t; and the Si&s;ters north 27&deg; ea&s;t, at the di&s;tance of twelve or thirteen miles. Our latitude, at the &s;ame time, was 5&deg; 21&prime; &s;outh, and our longi|tude 105&deg; 57&prime; ea&s;t.</P>
<P>About four in the afternoon we perceived two ve&s;&s;els in the Straits of Sunda; one of which lay at anchor near the Mid-channel I&s;land, the other nearer the &s;hore of Java; and as we did not know to what nation they might belong, we thought proper to prepare our &s;hips for action. At &s;ix o'clock, we dropped our anchors in twenty-five fathoms water, about four miles ea&s;t by &s;outh from North I&s;land. Here we remained the whole night, during which we had very heavy thunder and lightning to the north-we&s;t; the wind blowing in light breezes from the &s;ame quarter, attended with violent rain.</P>
<P>On the 8th, about eight o'clock in the morn|ing, we weighed, and proceeded through the Straits of Sunda, the tide &s;etting towards the &s;outh, as it had done all the preceding night At ten, the wind failing, we anchored again in thirty-five fathoms; an elevated i&s;land, or rather rock, named the Grand Toque, bearing &s;outh by ea&s;t. Being, at that time, not above two miles from the &s;hips before mentioned, which now hoi&s;ted Dutch colours, Captain Gore &s;ent a boat on board to procure intelligence. The rain &s;till
<PB N="286" REF="030274_1575_0FE57B200C2D10C0">
continued, accompanied with thunder and light|ning.</P>
<P>The boat returned early in the afternoon, with information that the larger of the two ve&s;&s;els was a Dutch Ea&s;t-Indiaman, bound for Europe; and the other a packet from Batavia, with in&s;tructions for the &s;everal &s;hips lying in the Straits. It is cu&s;|tomary for the Dutch &s;hips, when their cargoes are almo&s;t completed, to quit Batavia, on account of its very unwhole&s;ome climate, and repair to &s;ome of the more healthy i&s;lands in the Straits, where they wait for their di&s;patches, and the remainder of their lading. The Indiaman, notwith&s;tanding this precaution, had lo&s;t four men, &s;ince &s;he had left Batavia, and had as many more who&s;e lives were de&s;paired of. She had remained here a fort|night, and was now on the point of proceeding to Cracatoa to take in water, having ju&s;t received final orders by the packet.</P>
<P>At &s;even o'clock the next morning, we weighed anchor, and &s;teered to the &s;outh-we&s;tward through the Straits, taking care to keep clo&s;e in with the i&s;lands on the Sumatra &s;hore, for the purpo&s;e of avoiding a rock near Mid-channel I&s;land, which was &s;ituated on our left.</P>
<P>Between ten and eleven, Captain King was ordered by Captain Gore to make &s;ail towards a Dutch ve&s;&s;el that now came in &s;ight to the &s;outh|ward, and which we imagined was from Europe; and, according to the nature of the information
<PB N="287" REF="030274_1576_0FE57B2BD5449C50">
that might be obtained from her, either join him at Cracatoa, where he de&s;igned to &s;top, in order to furni&s;h the &s;hip with arrack; or to proceed to the &s;outh-ea&s;tern extremity of Prince's I&s;land, and there provide a &s;upply of water, and wait for him. In compliance with the&s;e in&s;tructions, Captain King bore down towards the Dutch &s;hip, which, in a &s;hort time after, ca&s;t anchor to the ea&s;tward: when the current &s;etting with great force in the Straits to the &s;outh-we&s;t, and the wind &s;lackening, Mr. King was unable to fetch her: having therefore got as near her as the tide would allow, he al&s;o anchored. He immediately &s;ent Mr. William&s;on, in the cutter, with orders to get on board the Dutch ve&s;&s;el, if po&s;&s;ible; but, as &s;he lay at the di&s;tance of almo&s;t a mile, and the tide ran with great rapidity, the boat dropped fa&s;t a&s;tern; in con&s;equence of which, Captain King having made the &s;ignal to return, began, without delay, to veer away the cable, and &s;ent out a buoy a&s;tern, to a&s;&s;i&s;t the boat's crew in get|ting on board again.</P>
<P>Our poverty with re&s;pect to cordage, was, on this occa&s;ion, very con&s;picuous: for there was not, in the Di&s;covery's &s;tore-room, a &s;ingle coil of rope, to fix to the buoy; &s;o that her people were under the nece&s;&s;ity of veering away two cables, and the greater part of their running rigging, before the boat, which was driving very rapidly to the &s;outhward, could fetch the buoy.</P>
<P><PB N="288" REF="030274_1577_0FE57C008EA2D768">Captain King was now obliged to wait till the force of the tide &s;hould abate; and this did not happen till the following morning, when Mr. William&s;on went on board the Dutch &s;hip, and was informed, that &s;he had been &s;even months from Europe, and three from the Cape of Good Hope; that, before her depart<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">re, the kings of France and Spain had declared war again&s;t his Britannic Maje&s;ty; and that &s;he had left Sir Ed|ward Hughes at the Cape, with a &s;quadron of men of war, and al&s;o a fleet of Ea&s;t-India &s;hips. Mr. William&s;on being, at the &s;ame time, a&s;&s;ured, that the water of Cracatoa was extremely good, and that the Dutch always preferred it to that of Prince's I&s;land, Captain King determined to re|join the Re&s;olution at the former place. He therefore, taking the advantage of a fair breeze, weighed, and made &s;ail towards the i&s;land of Cracatoa, where he &s;oon after perceived her at anchor; but the tide &s;etting forcibly again&s;t him, and the wind failing, he again thought proper to ca&s;t anchor, at the di&s;tance of near two leagues from the Re&s;olution, and immediately di&s;patched a boat on board, to communicate to Captain Gore the intelligence procured by Mr. William&s;on.</P>
<P>When the Re&s;olution &s;aw her con&s;ort preparing to come too, &s;he fired her guns, and di&s;played the &s;ignal for leading a-head, by hoi&s;ting an Engli&s;h jack at the en&s;ign &s;taff. This was intended to prevent the Di&s;covery's anchoring, on account of

the foul ground, which the maps on board the Re&s;olution plated in this &s;ituation. However, as Captain King met with none, but, on the con|trary, found a muddy bottom, and good anchor|ing-ground, at the depth of &s;ixty fathoms, he remained fa&s;t till the return of the boat, which brought him orders to proceed to Prince's I&s;land the en&s;uing morning.

<P>Cracatoa is the &s;outhernmo&s;t of a clu&s;ter of i&s;lands lying in the entrance of the &s;traits of Sunda.

The whole circumference of the i&s;land does not exceed nine miles. Off its north-ea&s;tern extreme is a &s;mall i&s;land, forming the road where the Re|&s;olution anchored; and within a reef runing off the &s;outhern end of the latter, there is tolerable &s;helter again&s;t all northerly winds, with twenty-&s;even fathoms water in the mid-channel, and eighteen near the reef. Towards the north-we&s;t,

there is a narrow pa&s;&s;age between the two i&s;lands for boats.</P>
<P>The &s;hore that con&s;titutes the we&s;t &s;ide of the road, runs in a north-we&s;terly direction, and has a bank of coral extending into the &s;ea, about a third of the length of a cable, which renders landing difficult for boats, except at the time of high water; but the anchoring-ground is very good, and clear of rocks. The place where the Re&s;olution procured a &s;upply of water is a &s;mall &s;pring, abrea&s;t of the &s;outhern extreme of the &s;mall i&s;land, at no great di&s;tance from the &s;ea-&s;ide. To the &s;outhward there is a &s;pring, who&s;e water is extremely hot, and is u&s;ed by the in|habitants as a bath. Whil&s;t we lay off the &s;outh end of this i&s;land, the ma&s;ter was &s;ent a&s;hore, in a boat, to &s;earch for water; but, after he had landed with &s;ome difficulty, he returned without &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>Cracatoa con&s;i&s;ts of elevated land, gradually ri&s;ing on all &s;ides from the &s;ea; and is entirely covered with trees, except a few &s;pots which have been cleared by the natives for the purpo&s;e of forming rice fields. The population of the i&s;land is very incon&s;iderable. Its Chief is dependent on the King of Bantam, to whom the Chiefs of all the other i&s;lands in the &s;traits are al&s;o &s;ubject. The coral reefs afford &s;mall turtles in abundance; but other refre&s;hments are exceedingly &s;carce, and are &s;old at a very exorbitant price. This

<P>About eight in the evening the wind began to blew fre&s;h from the we&s;t, accompanied with violent thunder, lightning, and rain. The next morning (the 11th) at three o'clock, Captain King weighed anchor, and &s;teered for Prince's I&s;land; but the we&s;terly wind dying away, a breeze from the &s;outh-ea&s;t &s;ucceeded, and the tide, at the &s;ame time &s;etting with great force to the &s;outh-we&s;tward, he was prevented from fetch|ing the i&s;land, and obliged, at two in the after|noon, to anchor at the di&s;tance of nine or ten miles from it, in &s;ixty-five fathoms water, over a muddy bottom; the elevated hill bearing &s;outh-we&s;t by &s;outh, and the peak of Cracatoa north by ea&s;t.</P>
<P>Light airs and calms prevailed till &s;ix o'clock the following morning, at which time the Di&s;|covery weighed and made &s;ail, though, in heav|ing the anchor out of the ground, the old me&s;|&s;enger was twice broken and al&s;o a new one.
<PB N="292" REF="030274_1581_0FE57BF42BE57128">
This, however, was entirely owing to the mi&s;era|ble &s;tate of the cordage, &s;ince the &s;train was not very con&s;iderable.</P>
<P>The wind being fair, &s;he came to an anchor, at twelve o'clock, off the &s;outh-ea&s;tern extremity of Prince's I&s;land, in twenty-&s;ix fathoms water, over a bottom of &s;and, at the di&s;tance of half a mile from the neare&s;t part of the &s;hore; the ea&s;t end of the i&s;land bearing north-north-ea&s;t, the high peak north-we&s;t half we&s;t, and the mo&s;t &s;outherly point in view &s;outh-we&s;t by &s;outh.</P>
<P>The Di&s;covery had no &s;ooner anchored, than Lieutenant Lannyon, who had been at this i&s;land, in the year 1770, with Captain Cook, was di&s;|patched, in company with the ma&s;ter, to &s;earch for the watering-place. The brook from which the Endeavour, according to the be&s;t of Mr. Lannyon's recollection, had been furni&s;hed, was now found extremely &s;alt. They ob&s;erved fur|ther inland a dry bed, where the water had pro|bably lodged in rainy &s;ea&s;ons; and another run about a cable's length below, &s;upplied from a &s;pa|cious pool, who&s;e bottom, as well as &s;urface, was covered with dead leaves. This, though &s;omewhat bracki&s;h, being far &s;uperior to the other, the Di&s;|covery's people began watering here early in the morning of the 13th, and fini&s;hed that &s;ervice the &s;ame day.</P>
<P>The inhabitants, who came to them &s;oon after they had anchored, brought a con&s;iderable quan|tity
<PB N="293" REF="030274_1582_0FE57BFF0AF1AA90">
of fowls, and &s;ome turtles; the la&s;t, however, were in general very &s;mall. During the night, it rained with great violence; and on Mon|day the 14th, at day-break, the Re&s;olution was &s;een to the north, &s;teering towards the i&s;land, and about two o'clock in the afternoon, &s;he ca&s;t anchor clo&s;e to the Di&s;covery.</P>
<P>As Captain Gore had not completed his &s;tock of water at Cracatoa, he &s;ent his men a&s;hore on the 15th, who repaired to the brook that was fir&s;t mentioned, which was now become perfectly &s;weet in con&s;equence, of the rain, and flowed in great abundance. This being a trea&s;ure too valuable to be di&s;regarded, Captain King gave orders, that all the ca&s;ks which the &s;eamen of his &s;hip had before filled &s;hould be &s;tarted, and re|pleni&s;hed with the fre&s;h water. This was ac|cordingly performed by twelve o'clock the next day; and in the evening the decks were cleared, and both ve&s;&s;els prepared for &s;ea.</P>
<P>We had heavy rains, and variable winds, in the morning of the 18th, which prevented us from getting under way till two o'clock in the afternoon, when a light northerly wind aro&s;e; but this being of &s;hort duration, we were under the nece&s;&s;ity of anchoring again, at eight in the evening, in fifty fathoms water. The following morning, at the &s;ame hour, being favoured by a north-we&s;terly breeze, we broke ground, to our extreme &s;atisfaction, for the la&s;t time in the &s;traits

of Sunda; on the 20th, we had totally lo&s;t &s;ight of Prince's i&s;land.</P>
<P>As this i&s;land has been de&s;cribed by Captain Cook in the narrative of a former voyage, we &s;hall only add, that we were uncommonly &s;truck with the great general re&s;emblance of the natives in point of complexion, figure, manners, and even language, to the inhabitants of the various i&s;lands vi&s;ited by us in the Pacific Ocean.</P>
<P>The country is &s;o plentifully furni&s;hed with wood, that, notwith&s;tanding the quantities an|nually cut down by the crews of the ve&s;&s;els which touch at this i&s;land, there is no appearance of its diminution. We were well &s;upplied with fowls of a moderate &s;ize, and &s;mall turtles; the former of which we purcha&s;ed at the rate of a Spani&s;h dollar for ten. The natives likewi&s;e brought us many hog-deer, and an amazing number of mon|kies, to our great annoyance, as the greater part of our &s;ailors found means to procure one, if not two, of the&s;e trouble&s;ome and mi&s;chievous ani|mals.</P>
<P>If Mr. Lannyan had not been with us, we &s;hould probably have met with &s;ome difficulty in finding the watering place: it may, therefore, not be improper to give a particular de&s;cription of its &s;ituation, for the benefit of &s;ub&s;equent navigators. The peaked hill on the i&s;land bears north-we&s;t by north from it; a remarkable tree, which grows on a coral reef, and is entirely de|tached

The&s;e marks will i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">|cate the place where the pool di&s;charges it&s;elf into the &s;ea; but the water here, as well as that which is in the pool, being in general &s;alt, the ca&s;ks mu&s;t be filled about fifty yards higher up; where, in dry &s;ea&s;ons, the fre&s;h water which de&s;cends from the hills, is in a great mea&s;ure lo&s;t among the leaves, and mu&s;t therefore be &s;earched for by clearing them away.</P>
<P>The latitude of the anchoring-place at Prince's I&s;land is 6&deg; 36&prime; 15&Prime; &s;outh, and its longitude 165&deg; 17&prime; 30&Prime; ea&s;t. The variation of the compa&s;s was 54&prime; we&s;t; and the mean of the thermometer 83&deg;.</P>
<P>We had begun to experience, from the time of our entering the &s;traits of Banca, the pernici|ous effects of this noxious climate. Two of the Di&s;covery's people became dangerou&s;ly ill of malignant putrid fevers; which, however, were prevented from being communicated to others, by putting the patients apart from the re&s;t of the crew, in the mo&s;t airy births. Many of us were attacked with di&s;agreeable coughs; &s;everal com|plained of violent pains in the head; and even the mo&s;t healthy per&s;ons among us felt a &s;en&s;ation of &s;uffocating heat, accompanied with an extreme languor, and a total lo&s;s of appetite.</P>
<P><PB N="296" REF="030274_1585_0FE57C3595B18B08">Though our &s;ituation, however, was for a time thus unea&s;y, and even alarming, we had, at la&s;t, the inexpre&s;&s;ible &s;atisfaction of e&s;caping from th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e de&s;tructive &s;eas without the lo&s;s of a &s;ingle life. This circum&s;tance, in all probability, was partly owing to the vigorous health of the &s;hip's companies, on our fir&s;t arrival in the&s;e parts, as well as to the unremitting attention, that was now become habitual in our men, to the prudent and &s;alutary regulations introduced among us by Captain Cook.</P>
<P>At the time of our departure from Prince's I&s;land, and during our whole pa&s;&s;age from thence to the Cape of Good Hope, the people of the Re&s;olution were in a far more &s;ickly condition than tho&s;e of the Di&s;covery. For though many of the crew of the latter &s;hip continued, for &s;ome time, to complain of the effects of the pe&s;tilential climate they had left, they all happily recovered. Of the two who had been afflicted with fevers, one, after having been &s;eized, on the 12th, of February, with violent convul&s;ions, which re|duced him to the verge of di&s;&s;olution, obtained &s;uch relief from the application of bli&s;ters, that he was out of danger in a &s;hort time afterwards: the other recovered, but by more &s;low degrees. On board the Re&s;olution, be&s;ides the fevers and coughs under which the greater part of the crew laboured, many were attacked with fluxes, the number of whom, contrary to our expectations,
<PB N="297" REF="030274_1586_0FE57BE356C0B118">
continued to augment till our arrival at the Cape of Good Hope.</P>
<P>This difference was partly a&s;cribed by Captain Gore, and probably not without good rea&s;on, to the Di&s;covery's fire-place being between decks; the heat and &s;moke of which, he was of opinion, contributed to mitigate the noxious effects of the damp nocturnal air. But Captain King was rather inclined to imagine, that his people e&s;caped the flux by the precautions which were taken to pre|vent their receiving it from others. For, if &s;ome kinds of fluxes be, as he apprehended they were, contageous, he thought it not improbable that the crew of the Re&s;olution caught this di&s;order from the Dutch ve&s;&s;els at Cracatoa. For the purpo&s;e of avoiding this danger, Mr. William|&s;on, when he was di&s;patched to the Ea&s;t-India-man in the entrance of the &s;traits of Sunda, was &s;trictly commanded to &s;uffer none of his people, on any account whatever, to go on board; and afterwards, whenever the Di&s;covery had occa&s;ion to have any communication with her con&s;ort, the &s;ame caution was continually ob&s;erved.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as we were clear of Prince's I&s;land, we had a light breeze from the we&s;t-north-we&s;t point. This, however, was not of long dura|tion; for, on the 20th, the wind again became variable, and remained &s;o till the 25th at noon, when it blew fre&s;h from the northward, with &s;qualls.</P>

<P>The following morning, at &s;even o'clock, we de&s;cried the land to the north at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance. On the 8th, the wind blew fre&s;h from the north-we&s;t, with &s;qualls.

proper to decline an offer, the acceptance of which might perhaps have brought him into a very embarra&s;&s;ing dilemma, in ca&s;e of our fall|ing in with any of the &s;hips belonging to our enemies.</P>
<P>During our continuance at the Cape, we met with the mo&s;t friendly treetment, not only from the Governor, but al&s;o from the other principal per&s;ons of the place, as well Africans as Euro|peans. On our fir&s;t arrival, Colonel Gordon, the Commander of the Dutch troops, was ab&s;ent on a journey into the inland parts of Africa, but returned before we left the Cape. Upon this occa&s;ion, he had penetrated further into the in|terior parts of the country than any preceding traveller, and made very con&s;iderable additions to the excellent collection of natural curo&s;ities with which he has contributed to enrich the Mu|&s;eum of the Prince of Orange. Indeed his long re&s;idence at the Cape, and the great a&s;&s;i&s;tance he has derived from his rank and &s;tation there, joined to an ardent de&s;ire of knowledge, and an active, indefatigable &s;pirit, have enabled him to gain a more perfect knowledge of this part of Africa, than any other per&s;on has had an oppor|tunity of acquiring; and it is with plea&s;ure we congratulate the public, on his intentions of pub|li&s;hing a narrative of his travels.</P>
<P>Fal&s;e Bay lies to the ea&s;tward of the Cape of Good Hope, and is frequented by ve&s;&s;els during
<PB N="305" REF="030274_1594_0FE57C0870AC3480">
the prevalence of the north-we&s;terly winds, which begin to exert their influence in May, and render it dangerous to remain in Table Bay. It is ter|minated to the ea&s;tward by Fal&s;e Cape, and to the we&s;tward by the Cape of Good Hope. It is eighteen miles wide at its entrance, and the two Capes bear due ea&s;t and we&s;t from each other.</P>
<P>At the di&s;tance of eleven to twelve miles from the Cape of Good Hope, on the we&s;tern &s;ide, is &s;ituated Simon's Bay, the only commodious &s;ta|tion for &s;hipping to lie in; for, though the road without it affords tolerable anchorage, it is rather too open, and not well adapted for procuring nece&s;&s;aries, the town being &s;mall, and &s;upplied with provi&s;ions from Cape-Town, which &s;tands at the di&s;tance of about twenty-four miles. To the north-north-ea&s;tward of Simon's Bay, there are &s;ome others, from which, however, it may with ea&s;e be di&s;tingu&s;hed, by a remarkable &s;andy way to the north of the town, which forms a con&s;picuous object.</P>
<P>In &s;teering for the harbour along the we&s;tern &s;hore, their is a &s;mall flat rock, known by the name of Noah's Ark; and about a mile to the north-ea&s;tward of it, there are &s;everal others, which are denominated the Roman Rocks. The&s;e are a mile and a half di&s;tant from the anchoring-place; and either to the northward of them, or
<PB N="306" REF="030274_1595_0FE57C06C1E72AD8">
between them, there is a &s;afe pa&s;&s;age into the Bay.</P>
<P>When the north-we&s;terly gales are &s;et in, the navigator, by the following bearings, will be directed to a &s;ecure and convenient &s;tation; Noah's Ark, &s;outh 51&deg; ea&s;t, and the centre of the ho&s;pital &s;outh 53&deg; we&s;t, in &s;even fathoms water. But, if the &s;outh-ea&s;terly winds &s;hould not have cea&s;ed blowing, it is more advi&s;eable to remain further out in eight or nine fathoms. The bottom con&s;i&s;ts of &s;and, and the anchors, before they get hold, &s;ettle con&s;iderably. The land, on the northern &s;ide of the bay, is low and &s;andy; but the ea&s;tern &s;ide is very elevated. About two leagues to the ea&s;tward of Noah's Ark, &s;tands Seal I&s;land, who&s;e &s;outhern part is &s;aid to be dangerous, and not to be approached, with &s;afety, nearer than in twenty-two fathoms water. There are many &s;unken rocks off the Cape of Good-Hope, &s;ome of which make their appear|ance at low water, and others con&s;tantly have breakers on them.</P>
<P>The anchoring-place in Simon's Bay is &s;ituated in the latitude of 34&deg; 20&prime; &s;outh, by ob&s;ervation; and its longitude is 18&deg; 29&prime; ea&s;t. It was high water, on the full and change days, at 5^h 55^m ap|parent time. The tide ro&s;e and fell five feet five inches; and, at the neap tides, the water ro&s;e only four feet one inch.</P>
<P><PB N="307" REF="030274_1596_0FE57BF5B1F2AEA0">According to the ob&s;ervations made by Cap|tain King and Mr. Bayly, on the 11th of April, when the Cape of Good Hope bore due we&s;t, its latitude is 34&deg; 23&prime; &s;outh, which is 4&prime; to the northward of the Abb&eacute; de la Caille's po&s;ition of it.</P>
<P>Having provided the nece&s;&s;ary quantity of naval &s;tores, and compleated our victualling, we quitted Simon's Bay on Tue&s;day the 9th of May. On the 14th of the &s;ame month, we got into the &s;outh-ea&s;t trade wind, and &s;tood to the we&s;t of the i&s;lands of A&s;cen&s;ion and St. Helena. On Wedne&s;day, the 31&s;t, we were in the latitude of 12&deg; 48&prime; &s;outh, and the longitude of 15&deg; 40&prime; we&s;t. On the 12th of June, we pa&s;&s;ed the equi|noctial line for the fourth time during our voyage, in the longitude of 26&deg; 16&prime; we&s;t.</P>
<P>We now perceived the effects of a current &s;et|ting north by ea&s;t, at the rate of half a mile in a hour. After continuing in the &s;ame direction till the middle of July, it began to &s;et a little to the &s;outhward of the we&s;t. On Saturday, the 12th of Augu&s;t, we de&s;cried the we&s;tern coa&s;t of Ireland, and endeavoured to get into Port Galway, from whence Captain Gore intended to have di&s;patched the journals and charts of our voyage to London. This attempt, however, proved ineffectual; and we were compelled, by violent &s;outherly winds, to &s;tand to the north.</P>
<P><PB N="308" REF="030274_1597_0FE57BF7A514CC40">Our next de&s;ign was to put into Lough Swil|ly, but the wind continuing in the &s;ame quarter, we &s;teered to the northward of the i&s;land of Lewis; and on Tue&s;day, the 22d of Augu&s;t, about eleven o'clock in the forenoon, both our ve&s;&s;els anchor|ed at Stromne&s;s. From this place Captain King was &s;ent by Captain Gore to inform the Lords of the Admiralty of our arrival; and, on Wedne&s;|day the 4th of october, the &s;hips reached the Nore in &s;afety, after an ab&s;ence of four years, two months, and two and twenty days.</P>
<P>When Captain King quitted the Di&s;covery at Stromne&s;s, he had the &s;atisfaction of leaving the whole &s;hip's company in perfect health; and, at the &s;ame time, the number of &s;ick per&s;ons on board the Re&s;olution did not exceed two or three, only one of whom was incapable of &s;ervice. In the whole cour&s;e of the voyage, the Re&s;olution lo&s;t no more than five men by &s;ickne&s;s, three of whom, at the time of our departure from Great-Britain, were in a precarious &s;tate of health: the Di&s;covery did not lo&s;e one individual. A &s;trict attention to the excellent regulations e&s;tabli&s;hed by Captain Cook, with which our readers are, doubtle&s;s, already acquainted, may ju&s;tly be deemed the chief cau&s;e, under the ble&s;&s;ing of Divine Providence, of this extraordinary &s;ucce&s;s. But, notwith&s;tanding the&s;e &s;alutary precautions, we might, perhaps, in the end, have felt the pernicious effects of &s;alt provi&s;ions, had we not
<PB N="309" REF="030274_1598_0FE57BE8747EEB48">
availed our&s;elves of every &s;ub&s;titute which our &s;ituation, at different times, afforded us. As the&s;e were &s;ometimes extremely nau&s;eous, fre|quently con&s;i&s;ting of articles which our people had not been accu&s;tomed to con&s;ider as food for men, it became nece&s;&s;ary, for the purpo&s;e of re|moving their prejudices, and conquering their di&s;gu&s;ts, to employ the united aid of per&s;ua&s;ion, example, and authority.</P>
<P>Portable &s;oup and &s;our krout were the preven|tives we principally depended on. We had no opportunity of trying the effects of the anti&s;cor|butic remedies, with which we were plentifully furni&s;hed, as they did not appear, during our whole voyage, the &s;lighte&s;t &s;ymptoms of the &s;curvy among the crew of either &s;hip.</P>
<P>Our malt and hops had likewi&s;e been kept as a re&s;ource in ca&s;e of &s;ickne&s;s; but, on being ex|amined at the Cape of Good Hope, they were found totally &s;poiled. About the &s;ame time, we opened &s;ome ca&s;ks of oatmeal, pea&s;e, groats, flour, bi&s;cuit, and malt, which, for the &s;ake of experiment, we had put up in &s;mall ca&s;ks, lined with tin-frail; and all the articles, except the pea&s;e, were found in a much better condition, than could have been expected in the ordinary mode of package.</P>
<P>On this occa&s;ion, we cannot omit recommend|ing to the con&s;ideration of government, the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of furni&s;hing &s;uch of his Maje&s;ty's &s;hips
<PB N="310" REF="030274_1599_0FE57BEA8CE02480">
as may be expo&s;ed to the influence of unhealthy climates, with a &s;ufficient quantity of Peruvian bark. It fortunately happened in the Di&s;covery, that only one of the men who were attacked with fevers in the Straits of Sunda, &s;tood in need of this valuable medicine; for the whole quantity that &s;urgeons are accu&s;tomed to carry out in &s;uch ve&s;&s;els as ours, was con&s;umed by him alone. If more per&s;ons had been affected in the &s;ame man|ner, it is probable that they would all have peri&s;h|ed, for want of the only remedy that could effec|tually have relieved them.</P>
<P>We &s;hall conclude our narrative of this voyage, with the mention of a circum&s;tance, which, if we con&s;ider its long duration, and the nature of the &s;ervice in which we were employed, &s;eems &s;carce|ly le&s;s remarkable than the uncommon healthine&s;s of the &s;hips' companies. This was, that our ve&s;&s;els never lo&s;t &s;ight of each other for a whole day, ex|cept on two occa&s;ions; the fir&s;t of which was the con&s;equence of an accident that befel the Di&s;covery off the coa&s;t of Owhyhee; and the &s;econd was owing to the fogs we met with at the entrance of the bay of Awat&s;ka. As this &s;hare of merit be|longs almo&s;t entirely to the inferior officers, it fur|ni&s;hes a &s;triking proof of their &s;kill and vigilance.
