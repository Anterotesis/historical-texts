<HEAD>REPORT OF THE SECRETARY OF STATE.</HEAD>
<P>THE Secretary of State, to whom was referred by the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;en|tatives, the repre&s;entation from the General Court of the Commonwealth of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, on the &s;ubjects of the Cod and Whale Fi&s;heries, together with the &s;everal papers accompanying it, has had the fame under con&s;ideration, and thereupon makes the following&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>REPORT.</HI></P>
<P>THE repre&s;entation &s;ets forth that, before the late way, about four thou&s;and &s;eamen, and twenty-four thou&s;and tons of &s;hipping were annually employed, from that State, in the whale fi&s;hery, the produce whereof was about three hundred and fifty thou&s;and pounds lawful money a year.</P>
<P>That, previous to the &s;ame period, the cod fi&s;hery of that State, employed four thou&s;and men, and twenty-eight thou&s;and tons of &s;hipping&punc; and produced about two hundred and fifty thou&s;and pounds a year.</P>
<P>That the&s;e branches of bu&s;ine&s;s, annihilated during the war, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> in &s;ome degree, recovered &s;ince: but that they labour under many and heavy embarra&s;&s;ments, which, if not removed, or le&s;&s;ened, will render the fi&s;heries every year le&s;s exten&s;ive and important.</P>
<P>That the&s;e embarra&s;&s;ments are, heavy duties on their produce abroad, and bounties on that of their competitors: and duties at home on &s;everal articles, particularly u&s;ed in the fi&s;heries.</P>
<P>And it a&s;ks that the duties be taken off; that bounties be given to the fi&s;her|men; and the national influence be u&s;ed abroad for obtaining better markets for their produce.</P>
<P>The cod and whale fi&s;heries, carried on by different per&s;ons, from different ports, in different ve&s;&s;els, in different &s;eas, and &s;eeking different markets, agree in one circum&s;tance, in being as unprofitable to the adventurer, as important to the public. A &s;uccinct view of their ri&s;e, progre&s;s, and pre&s;ent &s;tate, with diffe|rent nations, may enable us to note the circum&s;tances which have attended their pro&s;perity, and their decline, to judge of the embarra&s;&s;ments, which are &s;aid to oppre&s;s ours; to &s;ee whether they depend on our own will, and may, there|fore, be remedied immediately by our&s;elves, or, whether, depending on the will of others, they are without the reach of remedy, from us, either directly or indirectly.</P>
<P>Their hi&s;tory, being as unconnected as their practice, they &s;hall be &s;eparate|ly con&s;idered.</P>
<P>Within twenty years after the &s;uppo&s;ed di&s;covery of Newfoundland by the Ca|bots, we find that the abundance of fi&s;h on its banks, had already drawn the at|tention of the people of Europe. For, as early as 1517, or 1519, we are told of fifty &s;hips being &s;een there at one time. The fir&s;t adventurers in that fi&s;hery, were
<PB N="4" REF="023911_0003_0FC28DE7CD5256E0">
the Bi&s;cayans of Spain, the Ba&s;ques and Bas-Bretons of France, all united anciently in language, and &s;till in habits and in extreme poverty. The la&s;t cir|cum&s;tance enabled them long to retain a con&s;iderable &s;hare of the fi&s;hery. In 1577, the French had one hundred and fifty ve&s;&s;els there; the Spaniards had &s;till one hundred; and the Portugue&s;e fifty, when the Engli&s;h had only fifteen. The Spaniards and Portugue&s;e &s;eem, at length, to have retired &s;ilently, the French and Engli&s;h claiming the fi&s;hery exclu&s;ively, as an appurtenance to their adjacent colonies, and the profits being too &s;mall for nations &s;urcharged with the precious metals proceeding from their mines.</P>
<P>Without materials to trace the intermediate progre&s;s, we only know that &s;o late as 1744, the French employed there five hundred and &s;ixty-four &s;hips, and twenty &s;even thou&s;and five hundred &s;eamen, and took one million two hundred and forty &s;ix thou&s;and kentals of fi&s;h, which was three times the extent to which England and her colonies together carried this fi&s;hery at that time.</P>
<P>The Engli&s;h, in the beginning of the &s;eventeenth century, had employed, generally, about one hundred and fifty ve&s;&s;els in the Newfoundland fi&s;hery. About 1670, we find them reduced to eighty, and one hundred, the inhabi|tants of New-England beginning now to &s;upplant them. A little before this, the Briti&s;h parliament, perceiving that their citizens were unable to &s;ub&s;i&s;t on the &s;canty profits which &s;ufficed for their poorer competitors, endeavoured to give them &s;ome advantage by prohibiting the importation of foreign fi&s;h: and, at the clo&s;e of the century, they formed &s;ome regulations for their government and protection: and remitted to them &s;ome duties. A &s;ucce&s;sful war enabled them in 1713 to force from the French, a ce&s;&s;ion of the i&s;land of Newfound|land. Under the&s;e encouragements, the Engli&s;h and American fi&s;heries began to thrive. In 1731, we <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> the Engli&s;h take two hundred thou&s;and kentals of fi&s;h, and the Americans two hundred and thirty thou&s;and, be&s;ides the re|fu&s;e fi&s;h not fit for European markets. They continue to gain ground, and the French to lo&s;e it, in&s;omuch, that about 1755, they are &s;aid to have been on a par: and, in 1768, the French have only two hundred and fifty-nine ve&s;|&s;els of twenty-four thou&s;and four hundred and twenty tons, nine thou&s;and &s;e|ven hundred and twenty-two &s;eamen, taking two hundred thou&s;and kentals, while America alone, for &s;ome three or four years before that, and &s;o on to the commencement of the late war, employed &s;ix hundred and &s;ixty-five ve&s;&s;els, of twenty-five thou&s;and &s;ix hundred and fifty tons, and four thou&s;and four hundred and five &s;eamne, and took from three hundred and fifty thou&s;and, to upwards of four hundred thou&s;and kentals of fi&s;h, and England a &s;till greater quantity, five hundred and twenty-&s;ix thou&s;and kentals, as is &s;aid.</P>
<P>Spain had formally relinqui&s;hed her preten&s;ions to a participation in the&s;e fi&s;heries, at the clo&s;e of the preceding war: and, at the end of this, the adjacent continent and i&s;lands, being divided between the United States, the Engli&s;h and French (for the la&s;t retained two &s;mall i&s;lands merely for this object) the right of fi&s;hing was appropriated to them al&s;o.</P>
<P>France, &s;en&s;ible of the nece&s;&s;ity of balancing the power of England on the water, and therefore, of improving every re&s;ource for rai&s;ing &s;eamen, and &s;ee|ing that her fi&s;hermen could not maintain their competition without &s;ome pub|lic patronage, adopted the experiment of bounties on her own fi&s;h, and duties on that of foreign nations brought into her markets. But notwith&s;tanding this, her fi&s;heries dwindle, from a change taken place, in&s;en&s;ibly, in the character of her navigation, which, from being the mo&s;t economical, is now become the mo&s;t expen&s;ive. In 1786, &s;he is &s;aid to have employed but &s;even thou&s;and men in this fi&s;hery, and to have taken four hundred and twenty-&s;ix thou&s;and kentals; and in 1787, but &s;ix thou&s;and men, and one hundred and twenty-eight
<PB N="5" REF="023911_0004_0FC28DF69F8FC1F8">
thou&s;and kentals. She &s;eems not yet &s;en&s;ible that the unthriftine&s;s of her fi&s;heries proceeds from the want of economy, and not the want of markets; and that the encouragement of our fi&s;hery abridges that of a rival nation, who&s;e power on the ocean has long threatened the lo&s;s of all balance on that ele|ment.</P>
<P>The plan of the Engli&s;h government, &s;ince the peace, has been to prohibit all foreign fi&s;h in their markets, and they have given from eighteen to fifty pounds &s;terling, on every fi&s;hing ve&s;&s;el complying with certain conditions. This policy is &s;aid to have been &s;o far &s;ucce&s;sful as to have rai&s;ed the number of &s;ea|men employed in that bu&s;ine&s;s in 1786, to fourteen thou&s;and, and the quantity of fi&s;h taken, to &s;even hundred and thirty-two thou&s;and kentals. The table No. 1, hereto annexed, will pre&s;ent to the eye, this hi&s;tory more in detail.</P>
<P>The fi&s;heries of the United States, annihilated during the war; their ve&s;&s;els, uten&s;ils, and fi&s;hermen de&s;troyed; their markets in the Mediterranean and Bri|ti&s;h America lo&s;t, and their produce dutied in tho&s;e of France, their competitors enabled by bounties to meet and under &s;ell them at the few markets remaining open, without any public aid, and indeed, paying aids to the public: &s;uch were the hopele&s;s au&s;pices, under which this important bu&s;ine&s;s was to be re|&s;umed. Yet it was re&s;umed, and, aided by the mere force of natural advanta|ges, they employed, during the years 1786,&mdash;7,&mdash;8,&mdash;9, on an average, five hundred thirty-nine ve&s;&s;els, of nineteen thou&s;and one hundred eighty five tons, three thou&s;and two hundred eighty-&s;even &s;eamen, and took two hundred fifty thou&s;and &s;ix hundred fifty kentals of fi&s;h: (&s;ee No. 2) and an official paper (No. 3) &s;hews that, in the la&s;t of tho&s;e years, our exportation amounted to three hundred &s;eventy-five thou&s;and and twenty kentals, and thirty thou&s;and four hundred &s;ixty-one barrels, deduction made of three thou&s;and &s;even hundred one kentals, and &s;ix thou&s;and three hundred forty three barrels of foreign fi&s;h re|ceived and re-exported. (See No. 4.) Still, however, the calculations in (No. 5) which accompany the repre&s;entation, &s;hew, that the profits of the &s;ales in the years 1787,&mdash;8, were too &s;mall to afford a living to the fi&s;herman, and on tho&s;e of 1789, there was &s;uch a lo&s;s as to withdraw thirty-three ve&s;&s;els, of the town of Marblehead, alone, from the further pur&s;uit of this bu&s;ine&s;s: And the apprehen&s;ion is, that, without &s;ome public aid, tho&s;e &s;till remaining will continue to withdraw, and this whole commerce be engro&s;&s;ed by a &s;ingle na|tion.</P>
<P>This rapid view of the cod-fi&s;hery, enables us to di&s;cern under what policy it has flouri&s;hed or declined in the hands of other nations, and to mark the fact, that it is too poor a bu&s;ine&s;s to be left to it&s;elf, even with the nation the mo&s;t advantageou&s;ly &s;ituated.</P>
<P>It will now be proper to count the advantages which aid, and the di&s;advan|tages which oppo&s;e us in this conte&s;t.</P>
<P>Our advantages are&mdash;</P>
<P N="1">1. The neighbourhood of the great fi&s;heries, which permits our fi&s;hermen to bring home their fi&s;h to be &s;alted by their wives and children.</P>
<P N="2">2. The &s;hore fi&s;heries, &s;o near at hand as to enable the ve&s;&s;els to run into port in a &s;torm, and &s;o le&s;&s;en the ri&s;k, for which di&s;tant nations mu&s;t pay in|&s;urance.</P>
<P N="3">3. The winter fi&s;heries, which, like hou&s;hold manufactures, employ por|tions of time which would otherwi&s;e be u&s;ele&s;s.</P>
<P N="4">4. The &s;mallne&s;s of the ve&s;&s;els, which the &s;hortne&s;s of the voyage enables us to employ, and which, con&s;equently, require but a &s;mall capital.</P>
<P N="5"><PB N="6" REF="023911_0005_0FC28DF80C690850">5. The cheapne&s;s of our ve&s;&s;els, which do not co&s;t above the half of the Bal|tic fir ve&s;&s;els, computing price and duration.</P>
<P N="6">6. Their excellence as &s;ea boats, which decrea&s;es the ri&s;k, and quickens the returns.</P>
<P N="7">7. The &s;uperiority of our mariners in &s;kill, activity, enterprize, &s;obriety and order.</P>
<P N="8">8. The cheapne&s;s of provi&s;ions.</P>
<P N="9">9. The cheapne&s;s of ca&s;ks, which, of it&s;elf, is &s;aid to be equal to an extra profit of fifteen per cent.</P>
<P>The&s;e advantages are of &s;uch force, that, while experience has proved that no other nation can make a mercantile profit on the Newfoundland fi&s;hery, nor can &s;upport it without national aid, we can make a living profit, if vent for our fi&s;h can be procured.</P>
<P>Of the di&s;advantages oppo&s;ed to us, tho&s;e which depend on our&s;elves, are&mdash;</P>
<P>Tonnage, and naval duties on the ve&s;&s;els employed in the fi&s;hery.</P>
<P>Impo&s;t duties on &s;alt, on tea, rum, &s;ugar, mola&s;&s;es, hooks, lines and leads, duck, cordage and cables, iron, hemp and twine. U&s;ed in the fi&s;hery.</P>
<P>Cour&s;e woollens worn by the fi&s;hermen; and the poll-tax levied by the State on their per&s;ons. The &s;tatement, No. 6, &s;hews the amount of the&s;e, exclu&s;ive of the State tax, and drawback on the fi&s;h exported, to be 5.25 dollars per man, or 57.75 dollars per ve&s;&s;el of &s;ixty-five tons. When a bu&s;ine&s;s is &s;o nearly in equilibrio, that one can hardly di&s;cern whether the profit be &s;ufficient to con|tinue it, or not, &s;maller &s;ums than the&s;e &s;uffice to turn the &s;cale again&s;t it. To the&s;e di&s;advantages, add ineffectual duties on the importation of foreign fi&s;h. In ju&s;tification of the&s;e la&s;t, it is urged that the foreign fi&s;h received, is in ex|change for the produce of agriculture. To which it may be an&s;wered, that the thing given, is more merchantable than that received in exchange, and that agriculture has too many markets to be allowed to take away tho&s;e of the fi&s;h|eries. It will re&s;t, therefore, with the wi&s;dom of the legi&s;lature, to decide whether prohibition &s;hould not be oppo&s;ed to prohibition, and high duty to high duty, on the fi&s;h of other nations: Whether any, and which of the naval and other duties, may be remitted, or an equivalent given to the fi&s;herman in the form of a drawback or bounty; and whether the lo&s;s of markets abroad may not, in &s;ome degree, be compen&s;ated by creating markets at home; to which might contribute the con&s;tituting fi&s;h a part of the military ration, in &s;tations, not too di&s;tant from navigation, a part of the nece&s;&s;ary &s;ea &s;tores of ve&s;|&s;els, and the encouraging private individuals to let the fi&s;herman &s;hare with the cultivator, in furni&s;hing the &s;upplies of the table. A habit introduced from motives of patrioti&s;m, would &s;oon be followed, from motives of ta&s;te: And who will undertake to fix limits to this demand, if it can be once excited, with a nation which doubles, and will long continue to double at very &s;hort periods?</P>
<P>Of the di&s;advantages, which depend on others, are&mdash;
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. The lo&s;s of the Mediterranean markets.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Exclu&s;ions from the markets of &s;ome of our neighbours.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. High duties in tho&s;e of others, and&mdash;</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. Bounties to the individuals in competition with us.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>The con&s;ideration of the&s;e will find its place more aptly, after a review of the condition of our whale fi&s;hery, &s;hall have led us to the &s;ame point. To this branch of the &s;ubject, therefore, we will now proceed.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="023911_0006_0FC28DF904FC17B0">The whale fi&s;hery was fir&s;t brought into notice of the &s;outhern nations of Europe, in the fifteenth century, by the &s;ame Bi&s;cayans and Ba&s;ques, who led the way to the fi&s;hery of Newfoundland. They began it on their own coa&s;ts, but &s;oon found that the principal re&s;idence of the whale, was in the northern &s;eas, into which, therefore, they pur&s;ued him. In 1578, they employed twen|ty-five &s;hips in that bu&s;ine&s;s; the Dutch and Hamburghers took it up after this, and about the middle of the &s;eventeenth century, the former employed about two hundred &s;hips, and the latter three hundred and fifty.</P>
<P>The Engli&s;h endeavoured al&s;o to participate of it. In 1672, <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">25. Car. II. c. 7.</NOTE> they offered to their own fi&s;hermen a bounty of &s;ix &s;hillings a ton, on the oil they &s;hould bring home, and in&s;tituted at different times, different exclu&s;ive companies, all of which failed of &s;ucce&s;s. They rai&s;ed their bounty in 1733 <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">6. G. II. c. 33.</NOTE>, to twenty &s;hillings a ton on the admea&s;urement of the ve&s;&s;el. In 1740, to thirty &s;hillings, with a privilege to the fi&s;herman again&s;t being impre&s;&s;ed. The Ba&s;que-fi&s;hery, &s;up|ported by poverty alone, had maintained but a feeble exi&s;tence, before compe|titors, aided by the bounties of their nation, and was, in fine, annihilated by the war of 1745, at the clo&s;e of which, the Engli&s;h bounty was rai&s;ed to forty &s;hil|lings. From this epoch, their whale fi&s;hery went on between the limits of twenty-eight and &s;ixty-&s;even ve&s;&s;els, till the commencement of the la&s;t war.</P>
<P>The Dutch in the mean time, had declined gradually to about one hundred and thirty &s;hips, and have &s;ince that fallen down to le&s;s than half that number: &s;o that their fi&s;hery, notwith&s;tanding a bounty of thirty florins a man, as well as that of Hamburgh, is now nearly out of competition.</P>
<P>In 1715, the Americans began their whale fi&s;hery. They were led to it at fir&s;t by the whales which pre&s;ented them&s;elves on their coa&s;ts. They attacked them there in &s;mall ve&s;&s;els of forty tons. As the whale, being infe&s;ted, retired from the coa&s;t, they followed him farther and farther into the ocean, &s;till en|larging their ve&s;&s;els, with their adventures, to &s;ixty, one hundred, and two hun|dred tons. Having extended their pur&s;uit to the We&s;tern I&s;lands, they fell in, accidently, with the &s;permacaeti whale, of a different &s;pecies from that of Green|land, which alone had been hitherto known in commerce; more fierce and active, and who&s;e oil and head-matter was found to be more valuable, as it might be u&s;ed in the interior of hou&s;es without offending the &s;mell. The di&s;|tinction now fir&s;t aro&s;e between the northern and &s;outhern fi&s;heries&punc; the object of the former being the Greenland whale, which frequents the northern coa&s;ts and &s;eas of Europe and America, that of the latter being the &s;permacaeti whale, which was found in the &s;outhern &s;eas, from the We&s;tern I&s;lands and coa&s;t of Africa to that of Brazil, and &s;till on to the Falkland I&s;lands. Here again, within &s;oundings, on the coa&s;t of Brazil, they found a third &s;pecies of whale, which they called the black, or Brazil whale, &s;maller than the Greenland, yield|ing a &s;till le&s;s valuable oil, fit only for &s;ummer u&s;e, as it becomes opaque at fif|ty degrees of Farenheit's thermometer, while that of the &s;permacaeti whale is limped to forty-one, and of the Greenland whale to thirty-&s;ix, of the &s;ame ther|mometer. It is only worth taking therefore, when it falls in the way of the fi&s;hermen, but not worth &s;eeking, except when they have failed of &s;ucce&s;s again&s;t the &s;permacaeti whale, in which ca&s;e this kind, ea&s;ily found and taken, &s;erves to moderate their lo&s;s.</P>
<P>In 1771, the Americans had one hundred and eighty-three ve&s;&s;els, of thir|teen thou&s;and eight hundred and twenty tons, in the northern fi&s;hery, and one hundred and twenty-one ve&s;&s;els, of fourteen thou&s;and and twenty tons, in the
<PB N="8" REF="023911_0007_0FC28DFA8C06D798">
&s;outhern, navigated by four thou&s;and and fifty-nine men. At the beginning of the late war, they had one hundred and &s;eventy-&s;even ve&s;&s;els in the northern, and one hundred and thirty-two in the &s;outhern fi&s;hery.</P>
<P>At that period, our fi&s;hery being &s;u&s;pended, the Engli&s;h &s;eized the opportu|nity of pu&s;hing theirs. They gave additional bounties of five hundred, four hundred, three hundred, two hundred, one hundred pounds &s;terling, annually, to the five &s;hips, which &s;hould take the greate&s;t quantities of oil. The effect of which was &s;uch, as, by the year 1786, to double the quantity of common oil nece&s;&s;ary for their own con&s;umption. Finding, on a review of the &s;ubject, at that time, that their bounties had co&s;t the government thirteen pounds ten &s;hillings &s;terling a man annually, or &s;ixty per cent. on the cargoes, a part of which went con&s;equently to ea&s;e the purcha&s;es of this article made by foreign nations, they reduced the northern bounty from forty to thirty &s;hillings the ton of admea&s;urement.</P>
<P>They had &s;ome little time before turned their attention to the &s;outhern fi&s;h|ery, had given very great bounties in it, <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">26 G. III. c. 50.</NOTE> and had invited the fi&s;hermen of the United States, to conduct their enterprizes. Under their guidance, and with &s;uch encouragement, this fi&s;hery, which had only begun with them in 1784 or 1785, was ri&s;ing into value. In 1788, they increa&s;ed <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">28 G. III. c. 20.</NOTE> their bounties, and the temptations to our fi&s;hermen, under the general de&s;cription of <HI>foreigners who had been employed in the whale-fi&s;hery,</HI> to pa&s;s over with their families and ve&s;&s;els to the Briti&s;h dominions either in America or Europe, but preferably to the lat|ter. The effect of the&s;e mea&s;ures had been prepared by our whale oils becom|ing &s;ubject, in their market, to the foreign duty of eighteen pounds five &s;hil|lings &s;terling the ton, which, being more than equal to the price of the com|mon oil, operated as a prohibition on that, and gave to their own &s;permacaeti oil a preferance over ours to that amount. The particulars of this hi&s;tory are pre&s;ented to the eye, more in detail, in the table No. 7.</P>
<P>The fi&s;hermen of the United States, left without re&s;ource by the lo&s;s of their market, began to think of accepting the Briti&s;h invitation, and of removing&mdash; &s;ome to Nova-Scotia, preferring &s;maller advantages in the neighbourhood of their ancient country and friends, others to Great-Britain, po&s;tponing country and friends to high premiums.</P>
<P>The government of France could not be inattentive to the&s;e proceedings. They &s;aw the danger of letting four or five thou&s;and &s;eamen, of the be&s;t in the world, be transferred to the marine &s;trength of another nation, and carry over with them an art, which they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed almo&s;t exclu&s;ively. To give time for a counter plan, the Marquis de la Fayette, the valuable friend and citizen of this, as well as that country, wrote to a gentleman in Bo&s;ton to di&s;&s;uade the fi&s;her|men from accepting the Briti&s;h propo&s;als and to a&s;&s;ure them that their friends in France would endeavour to do &s;omething for them. A ve&s;&s;el was then ar|rived from Halifax, at Nantucket, to take off tho&s;e who had propo&s;ed to re|move. Two families had gone aboard, and others were going. In this mo|ment, the letter arriving, &s;u&s;pended their de&s;igns. Not another went aboard, and the ve&s;&s;el returned to Halifax with only the two families.</P>
<P>The plan adopted by the French mini&s;try, very different from that of the fir&s;t mover, was to give a counter invitation to the Nantucket men to remove and &s;ettle in Dunkirk, offering them a bounty of fifty livres (between nine and ten dollars) a ton on the admea&s;urement of the ve&s;&s;els they &s;hould equip for the whale fi&s;hery, with &s;ome other advantages. Nine families only, of thirty-three
<PB N="9" REF="023911_0008_0FC28DFCA61AC6A8">
per&s;ons, accepted this invitation. This was in 1785. In 1786, the mini&s;try were led to &s;ee, that their invitation would produce but little effect, and that the true means of preventing the emigration of our fi&s;hermen to the Briti&s;h do|minions, would be to enable them &s;till to follow their calling from their native country, by giving them a new market for their oils, in&s;tead of the old one they had lo&s;t. The duties were, therefore, abated on American whale oil immedi|ately, and a further abatement promi&s;ed by the letter, No. 8, and in Decem|ber, 1787, the arret, No. 9, was pa&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>The rival fi&s;hermen immediately endeavoured to turn this mea&s;ure to their own advantage, by pouring their whale oils into the markets of France, where they were enabled, by the great premiums received from their government, perhaps too by extraordinary indemnifications, to under&s;ell both the French and American fi&s;hermen. To repel this mea&s;ure, France &s;hut her ports to all fo|reign fi&s;h oils whatever, by the arret No. 10. The Briti&s;h whale fi&s;hery fell, in con&s;equence, the en&s;uing year, from two hundred and twenty-two to one hun|dred and &s;eventy-eight &s;hips. But this general exclu&s;ion had pal&s;ied our fi&s;he|ry al&s;o. On the &s;eventh of December, 1788, therefore, by the arret No. 11, the ports of France, &s;till remaining &s;hut to all other nations, were again opened to the produce of the whale fi&s;heries of the United States; continuing, however, their endeavours to recover a &s;hare in this fi&s;hery them&s;elves, by the aid of our fi&s;hermen. In 1784,&mdash;5,&mdash;6, they had had four &s;hips; in 1787, three; in 1788, &s;eventeen in the two fi&s;heries, of four thou&s;and five hundred ton. The&s;e co&s;t them in bounty, two hundred and twenty-five thou&s;and livres, which di|vided on one thou&s;and five hundred and fifty tons of oil, the quantity they took, amounted to one hundred and forty-five livres (near twenty-&s;even dol|lars) the ton; and on about one hundred natives on board the &s;eventeen &s;hips, (for there were one hundred and fifty Americans engaged by the voy|age) came to two thou&s;and two hundred and fifty livres, or about four hundred and &s;ixteen dollars and two-thirds a man.</P>
<P>We have had during the years 1787, 1788, 1789, on an average, ninety-one ve&s;&s;els, of five thou&s;and eight hundred and twenty tons, in the northern, and thirty-one, of four thou&s;and three hundred and ninety tons, in the &s;outhern fi&s;hery. See No. 12.</P>
<P>The&s;e details will enable Congre&s;s to &s;ee with what a competition we have to &s;truggle for the continuance of this fi&s;hery, not to &s;ay it's increa&s;e. Again&s;t prohibitory duties in one country, and bounties to the adventurers in both of tho&s;e which are contending with each other for the &s;ame object, ours have no auxiliaries but poverty and rigorous economy. The bu&s;ine&s;s, unaided, is a wretched one. The Dutch have peculiar advantages for the northern fi&s;hery, as being within &s;ix or eight days &s;ail of the grounds, as navigating with more economy than any other nation in Europe, their &s;eamen content with lower wages, and their merchants with lower profits. Yet the memorial No. 13, from a committee of the whale merchants to the States General of Holland in the year 1775, &s;tates that fourteen millions of guilders, equal to five millions &s;ix hundred thou&s;and dollars, had been lo&s;t in that fi&s;hery in forty-&s;even years, being about one hundred and twenty thou&s;and dollars a year. The States General thereupon gave a bounty of thirty guilders a man to the fi&s;hermen. A per&s;on intimately acquainted with the Briti&s;h whale fi&s;hery, and who&s;e information merits confidence, has given a&s;&s;urance that the &s;hips employed in their northern fi&s;hery in 1788, &s;unk eight hundred pounds each on an average, more than the amount of the produce and bounties. An Engli&s;h &s;hip of three hundred tons and forty-two &s;eamen in this fi&s;hery generally brings home, after a four months voyage, twenty-five ton of oil, worth four hundred and thirty-&s;even pounds ten &s;hillings &s;terling; but the wages of the officers and &s;eamen will be
<PB N="10" REF="023911_0009_0FC28DFD823BB760">
four hundred pounds, there remain but thirty-&s;even pounds ten &s;hillings, not worth taking into account towards the outfit and merchants profit. The&s;e then mu&s;t be paid by the government; and it is on this idea that the Briti&s;h bounty is calculated.</P>
<P>Our ve&s;&s;els for the northern fi&s;hery average &s;ixty-four tons, and co&s;t when built, fitted out, and victualled for their fir&s;t voyage, about three thou&s;and dollars. They have taken on an average the three la&s;t years, according to the &s;tatement No. 12, eighteen tons of oil, worth, at our market, nine hundred dollars, which are to pay all expences, and &s;ub&s;i&s;t the fi&s;herman and merchant. Our ve&s;&s;els for the &s;outhern fi&s;hery average one hundred and forty tons, and co&s;t, when built, fitted out, and victualled, for their fir&s;t voyage, about &s;ix thou&s;and five hundred dollars. They have taken on an average the three la&s;t years, according to the &s;ame &s;tatement, thirty-two tons of oil, each worth at our market three thou&s;and two hundred dollars, which are, in like manner, to pay all expences and &s;ub&s;i&s;t the owners and navigators. The&s;e expences are great, as the voyages are generally of twelve months duration. No hope can ari&s;e of their condition being bettered by an augmentation of the price of oil. This is kept down by the competition of the vegetable oils, which an&s;wer the &s;ame purpo&s;es, not quite &s;o well, but well enough to become preferable, were the price to be rai&s;ed, and &s;o well indeed as to be more generally u&s;ed than the fi&s;h oils for lighting hou&s;es and cities.</P>
<P>The American whale fi&s;hery is principally followed by the inhabitants of the i&s;land of Nantucket, a &s;and bar of about fifteen miles long and three broad, capable of maintaining by its agriculture about twenty families: but it employ|ed in the&s;e fi&s;heries before the war, between five and &s;ix thou&s;and men and boys; and in the only harbour it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, it had one hundred and forty ve&s;|&s;els, one hundred and thirty-two of which were of the larger kind, as being employed in the &s;outhern fi&s;hery. In agriculture then, they have no re&s;ource, and, if that of their fi&s;hery cannot be pur&s;ued from their own habitations, it is natural they &s;hould &s;eek others from which it can be followed, and pre|ferably tho&s;e where they will find a samene&s;s of language, religion, laws, ha|bits, and kindred. A foreign emi&s;&s;ary has lately been among them, for the purpo&s;e of renewing the invitations to a change of &s;ituation. But attached to their native country, they prefer continuing in it, if their continuance there can be made &s;upportable.</P>
<P>This brings us to the que&s;tion, what relief does the condition of this fi&s;hery require?</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. A remi&s;&s;ion of duties on the articles u&s;ed for their calling.</P>
<P N="2">2d. A retaliating duty on foreign oils, coming to &s;eek a competition with them in or from our ports.</P>
<P N="3">3d. Free markets abroad.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. The remi&s;&s;ion of duties will &s;tand on nearly the &s;ame ground with that to the cod fi&s;hermen.</P>
<P N="2">2d. The only nation who&s;e oil is brought hither for competition with our own, makes ours pay a duty of about eighty-two dollars the ton, in their ports. Theirs is brought here too, to be re-&s;hipped fraudulently under our flag into ports where it could not be received under theirs, and ought not to be covered by ours, if we mean to pre&s;erve our own admi&s;&s;ion into them. The</P>
<P N="3">3d, And principal object, is to find markets for the vent of oil.</P>
<P>Portugal, England, Holland, Sweden, Denmark, Pru&s;&s;ia, Ru&s;&s;ia, the Han&s;e towns, &s;upply them&s;elves and &s;omething more. Spain and Italy receive &s;up|plies from England, and need the le&s;s as their &s;kies are clearer. France is the
<PB N="11" REF="023911_0010_0FC28E0A70C50410">
only country which can take our &s;urplus, and they take principally of the com|mon oil; as the habit is but commencing with them of a&s;cribing a ju&s;t value to that of the &s;permacaeti whale. Some of this, however, finds its vent there. There was, indeed, a particular intere&s;t perpetually &s;oliciting the exclu&s;ion of our oils from their markets. The late government there &s;aw well, that what we &s;hould lo&s;e thereby, would be gained by others, not by them&s;elves. And we are to hope that the pre&s;ent government, as wi&s;e and friendly, will al&s;o view us, not as rivals, but as co-operators again&s;t a common rival. Friendly arrangements with them, and accommodation to mutual intere&s;t, rendered ea&s;ier by friendly di&s;po&s;itions exi&s;ting on both &s;ides, may long &s;ecure to us this important re&s;ource for our &s;eamen. Nor is it the intere&s;t of the fi&s;herman alone, which calls for the cultivation of friendly arrangements with that na|tion. Be&s;ides five-eighths of our whale oil, and two-thirds of our &s;alted fi&s;h, they take from us one-fourth of our tobacco, three-fourths of our live &s;tock (No. 14.) a con&s;iderable and growing portion of our rice, great &s;upplies oc|ca&s;ionally of other grain; in 1789, which, indeed, was extraordinary, four millions of bu&s;hels of wheat, and upwards of a million of bu&s;bels of rye and bar|ley (No. 15.) and nearly the whole carried in our own ve&s;&s;els (No. 16.) They are a free market now, and will in time be a valuable one for our &s;hips and &s;hip-timber, pota&s;h and peltry.</P>
<P>England is the market for the greater part of our &s;permacaeti oil. They im|po&s;e on all our oils, a duty of eighteen pounds five &s;hillings &s;terling the ton, which, as to the common kind, is a prohibition, as has been before ob&s;erved, and as to that of the &s;permacaeti, gives a preference of theirs over ours to that amount, &s;o as to leave in the end, but a &s;canty benefit to the fi&s;herman; and not long &s;ince, by a change of con&s;truction, without any change of the law, it was made to exclude our oils from their ports, when carried in our own ve&s;|&s;els. On &s;ome change of circum&s;tance, it was con&s;trued back again to the reception of our oils, on paying always, however the &s;ame duty of eighteen pounds five &s;hillings. This &s;erves to &s;hew that the tenure by which we hold the admi&s;&s;ion of this commodity in their markets, is as precarious as it is hard. Nor can it be announced, that there is any di&s;po&s;ition on their part, to arrange this or any other commercial matter, to mutual convenience. The exparte regulations which they have begun for mounting their navigation on the ruins of ours, can only be oppo&s;ed by counter regulations on our part. And the lo&s;s of &s;eamen, the natural con&s;equence of lo&s;t and ob&s;tructed markets for our fi&s;h and oil, calls in the fir&s;t place, for &s;erious and timely attention. It will be too late when the &s;eaman &s;hall have changed his vocation, or gone over to ano|ther intere&s;t. If we cannot recover and &s;ecure for him the&s;e important branches of employment, it behoves us to replace them by others equivalent. We have three nur&s;eries for forming &s;eamen;&mdash;</P>
<P N="1">1. Our coa&s;ting trade, already on a &s;afe footing.</P>
<P N="2">2. Our fi&s;heries, which in &s;pite of natural advantages, give ju&s;t cau&s;e of anxiety.</P>
<P N="3">3. Our carrying trade, the only re&s;ource of indemnification for what we lo&s;e in the other. The produce of the United States, which is carried to foreign markets, is extremely bulky. That part of it now in the hands of foreigners, and which we may re&s;ume into our own, without touching the rights of tho&s;e nations who have met us in fair arrangements by treaty, or the intere&s;ts of tho&s;e, who, by their voluntary regulations, have paid &s;o ju&s;t and liberal a re&s;pect to our intere&s;ts, as being mea&s;ured back to them again, places both parties on as good ground, perhaps, as treaties could place them: the proportion, I &s;ay, of our carrying trade, which may be re&s;umed without affecting either of the&s;e de&s;crip|tions of nations, will find con&s;tant employment for ten thou&s;and &s;eamen, be worth two millions of dollars annually, will go on augmenting with the popu|lation
<PB N="12" REF="023911_0011_0FC28E0E09A22FC0">
of the United States, &s;ecure to us a full indemnification for the &s;eamen we lo&s;s, and be taken wholly from tho&s;e who force us to this act of &s;elf-pro|tection, in navigation.</P>
<P>Hence too would follow that their Newfoundland &s;hips, not receiving pro|vi&s;ions from us in their bottoms, nor permitted (by a law of their own) to re|ceive in ours, mu&s;t draw their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence from Europe, which would encrea&s;e that part of their expences in the proportion of four to &s;even, and &s;o far oper|ate as a duty towards re&s;toring the level between them and us. The tables No. 2, and 12, will &s;how the quantity of tonnage, and con&s;equently the ma&s;s of &s;eamen who&s;e intere&s;ts are in di&s;tre&s;s; and No. 17, the materials for in|demnification.</P>
<P>If regulations, exactly the counterpart of tho&s;e e&s;tabli&s;hed again&s;t us, would be ineffectual from a difference of circum&s;tances, other regulations equivalent can give no rea&s;onable ground of complaint to any nation. Admitting their right of keeping their markets to them&s;elves, ours cannot be denied of keep|ing out carrying trade to our&s;elves. And if there be any thing unfriendly in this, it was in the fir&s;t example.</P>
<P>The lo&s;s of &s;eamen unnoticed, would be followed by other lo&s;&s;es in a long train. If we have no &s;eamen, our &s;hips will be u&s;ele&s;s, con&s;equently our &s;hip-timber, iron and hemp; our &s;hip-building will be at an end, &s;hip carpenters go over to other nations, our young men have no call to the &s;ea, our produce carried in foreign bottoms, be &s;addled with war-freight and in&s;urance in times of war; and the hi&s;tory of the la&s;t one hundred years, &s;hews that the nation which is our carrier has three years of war for every four years of peace. (No. 18) We lo&s;e, during the &s;ame periods, the carriage for belligerant pow|ers, which the neutrality of our flag would render an incalculable &s;ource of profit; we lo&s;e at this moment the carriage of our own produce to the annual amount of two millions of dollars, which in the po&s;&s;ible progre&s;s of the encroach|ment, may extend to five or &s;ix millions, the worth of the whole, with an in|crea&s;e in the proportion of the increa&s;e of our numbers. It is ea&s;ier as well as better, to &s;top this train at its entrance, than when it &s;hall have ruined or bani&s;hed whole cla&s;&s;es of u&s;eful and indu&s;trious citizens.</P>
<P>It will doubtle&s;s be thought expedient that the re&s;umption &s;ugge&s;ted &s;hould take effect &s;o gradually as not to endanger the lo&s;s of produce for the want of tran&s;portation; but that, in order to create tran&s;portation, the whole plan &s;hould be developed, and made known at once, that the individuals who may be di&s;po&s;ed to lay them&s;elves out for the carrying bu&s;ine&s;s may make their cal|culations on a full view of all circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>On the whole, the hi&s;torical view we have taken of the&s;e fi&s;heries proves they are &s;o poor in them&s;elves as to come to nothing with di&s;tant nations, who do not &s;upport them from their trea&s;ury. We have &s;een that the advantages of our po&s;ition place our fi&s;heries on a ground &s;omewhat higher, &s;uch as to re|lieve our trea&s;ury from the nece&s;&s;ity of giving them &s;upport, but not to permit it to draw &s;upport from them, nor to di&s;pen&s;e the government from the obliga|tion of effectuating free markets for them, that for the great proportion of our &s;alted fi&s;h, for our common oil, and a part of our &s;permacaeti oil, markets may perhaps, be pre&s;erved by friendly arrangements towards tho&s;e nations who&s;e arrangements are friendly to us, and the re&s;idue be compen&s;ated by giving to the &s;eamen thrown out of bu&s;ine&s;s the certainty of employment in another branch of which we have the &s;ole di&s;po&s;al.</P>

<HEAD>&mdash;No. VIII.&mdash; M. JEFFERSON, Mini&s;ter Plenipotentiary of the United States.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Fontainbleau,</HI>
<DATE><HI>October</HI> 22, 1786.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS it is the intention of the King to favor, as much as po&s;&s;ible, the com|merce of the United States, I have the honor to communicate to you the mea&s;ures that have been taken on this &s;ubject.</P>
<P>By a letter of the 9th January, 1784, to the Marquis de la Fayette, I in|formed him that in&s;tead of two free ports promi&s;ed by the treaty with the United States, the King had determined to grant them four, which has been done; and I promi&s;ed him that I would direct my attention to the cu&s;tom-hou&s;es and duties which are prejudicial to commerce, ob&s;erving however that this object demanded long inve&s;tigations, which are not yet compleated. By another letter I informed him, that his Maje&s;ty had &s;uppre&s;&s;ed the duties upon the exportation of brandy, and I expected this &s;uppre&s;&s;ion would be u&s;eful to the American commerce; I likewi&s;e promi&s;ed him that the duties of the King and the admiralty, payable by an American ve&s;&s;el on her arrival in a French port, &s;hould be dimini&s;hed and reduced to a &s;ingle duty, and regulated accord|ing to the number of ma&s;ts and draught of water, and not by the uncertain e&s;timation of mea&s;urement. This reduction requires a perfect knowledge of all the duties paid in our ports; and as they are of various kinds, the &s;tate|ments which I have ordered to be made are not ready.</P>
<P>You know, &s;ir, that the King has appointed a Committee for the particular purpo&s;e of examining our commercial connections with the United States, and that the Marquis de la Fayette has pre&s;ented a project conformable to the ideas contained in your letter to the Count de Vergennes; but you will con&s;ider how imprudent it would be to hazard by a change of &s;y&s;tem, the product of a branch of revenue which amounts to twenty-eight millions, upon an article which is not of the fir&s;t nece&s;&s;ity&mdash;after a long di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of every means that can be at pre&s;ent adopted to encourage the importation of American tobacco, it has been re&s;olved not to break the agreement made with Mr. Morris, but that after the expiration of this contract, no &s;imilar one &s;hall be made, and that in the mean while, the farmers general &s;hould be obliged to purcha&s;e, annually, about fifteen thou&s;and hog&s;heads of American tobacco imported directly from the United States, in French or American ve&s;&s;els at the &s;ame price, on the &s;ame conditions which have been &s;tipulated by the contract with Mr. Morris.</P>
<P>You will remember, &s;ir, that before a regulation could be made in favor of the importation of whale oil, the Marquis de la Fayette had taken a parti|cular arrangement with Mr. Sangrain for the &s;ale of this article, to the amount of eight hundred thou&s;and livres, and that I had granted him pa&s;&s;ports in or|der to render this fir&s;t importation, free from all duties what&s;oever. The &s;ame Mr. Sangrain, afterwards made an agreement with &s;ome merchants of Bo&s;ton, to the yearly amount of four hundred thou&s;and livres, to la&s;t during &s;ix years, for which his Maje&s;ty has granted the &s;ame favors which are enjoyed by the Han&s;e Towns.</P>
<P>This matter having been lately more exten&s;ively examined, the admini|&s;tration to whom the Committee communicated their wi&s;h, agreeable to the Marquis de la Fayette's demand and your opinion, entirely to aboli&s;h all duties upon oil, have found that at pre&s;ent, they could not con&s;ent to it, on account of the engagements made with other powers. All that could be done was to grant, during ten years, to the whale oil, &s;permacaeti, and whatever is compre|hended
<PB N="20" REF="023911_0019_0FC28E3442DDA868">
within the&s;e denominations, imported from the United States in French or American ve&s;&s;els, the &s;ame favors, the &s;ame diminution of duties which the Han&s;e Towns enjoy.</P>
<P>His Maje&s;ty hopes that the commercial connections between the United States and France, will become &s;o con&s;iderable as to engage him to continue the effect of this provi&s;ional determination; and as it has been ob&s;erved by the Committee, that a great duty of fabrication has been hitherto paid upon the mo&s;t favored whale oil, and even upon the national, his Maje&s;ty con&s;ents to aboli&s;h the duty of fabrication with re&s;pect to the whale oil and &s;permacaeti, directly imported from the United States in French or American bottoms, &s;o that this oil and &s;permacaeti &s;hall not pay, during ten years, any other duty but &s;even livres ten &s;ols, and ten &s;ols per livre; this la&s;t augmentation of ten &s;ols per livre, &s;hall cea&s;e in 1790.</P>
<P>It has al&s;o been determined that particular informations be taken concern|ing the con&s;umption of Carolina rice in France, and that means be devi&s;ed to encourage the importation of this article.</P>
<P>Repre&s;entations having been made concerning the con&s;iderable duties laid upon the importation of pot-a&s;h and pearl-a&s;h, al&s;o upon beaver-&s;kins and hair and raw leather, his Maje&s;ty has &s;uppre&s;&s;ed all duties what&s;oever upon tho&s;e articles, if imported of the growth of the United States in French or Ame|rican ve&s;&s;els. He is likewi&s;e de&s;irous of encouraging every article of Ameri|can fur.</P>
<P>His Maje&s;ty has moreover con&s;ented to aboli&s;h all duties upon ma&s;ts, yards, keels for &s;hips, red cedar, green oak, and in a word, all kinds of wood fit for &s;hip-building imported from the United States in French or American ve&s;&s;els.</P>
<P>The Committee having likewi&s;e repre&s;ented, that there was a duty of five per cent. on the purcha&s;e of foreign built &s;hips, and that this duty was preju|dicial to the &s;ale of American ve&s;&s;els, his Maje&s;ty has been plea&s;ed to exempt from all duties, the purcha&s;e of &s;hips which &s;hall be proved to be built in the United States.</P>
<P>Great duties having formerly been laid upon all &s;hrubs, trees and &s;eed, his Maje&s;ty has aboli&s;hed the&s;e duties, when the above articles &s;hall be imported in French or American ve&s;&s;els.</P>
<P>It having been repre&s;ented that the &s;tate of Virginia had ordered the arms for her militia to be made in France, an order is pa&s;&s;ed, that the prohibitions which hitherto have prevented the exportation of arms and gunpowder, as well as the duties laid upon the&s;e articles when exported by permi&s;&s;ion, &s;hall be aboli&s;hed; and that whenever the United States &s;hall think it expedient to export from France, arms, guns and gunpowder, they &s;hall have full per|mi&s;&s;ion, provided the&s;e articles are exported in French or American ve&s;&s;els, and they &s;hall be liable only to a very &s;mall duty, in order to facilitate the cal|culation of exports.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, his Maje&s;ty has received with the &s;ame favor, the applications made to the Committee for the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of the heavy duties actually paid upon books and papers of all kinds: the King aboli&s;hes all the&s;e duties when the above articles &s;hall be exported to the United States in French or American ve&s;&s;els.</P>
<P>It is with great plea&s;ure, &s;ir, that I inform you of the di&s;po&s;itions of his Ma|je&s;ty; they are a new te&s;timony of his great de&s;ire to e&s;tabli&s;h the mo&s;t inti|mate commercial connection between the two nations, and of the favorable

<P><HI>N. B.</HI> About one quarter of the &s;permacaeti is head-matter, one quarter of which was exported to Great-Britain, the remainder manufactured into can|dles. The &s;permacaeti oil, previous to the revolution, was mo&s;tly exported to Great-Britain. The average price in that market for five years previous to the war, about forty pounds &s;terling for the &s;permacaeti oil, and fifty pounds for head. The whale oil was formerly about one half exported to the French and Engli&s;h We&s;t-India i&s;lands, the other half &s;old in the United States. The average price of this oil, about &s;eventy dollars per ton. A whale producing one hundred and twenty barrels whale oil, will generally produce two thou|&s;and pounds bone, which was chiefly exported to Great-Britain, the price about half a dollar per pound: a whale producing fifty to &s;ixty barrels, will gene|rally produce neare&s;t ten pounds of bone to a barrel of oil.&mdash;The average price of oil for three years pa&s;t, as follows, viz.

<HEAD>&mdash;No. XIII.&mdash; Extract from a Memorial pre&s;ented to the States General in <HI>1775,</HI> by a Committee of the Merchants engaged in the Whale Fi&s;hery.</HEAD>
<P>THE whale fi&s;hery is of great importance to Holland, as the produce yield|ed by the &s;ea may properly be con&s;idered as our country produce, which fur|ni&s;h employ for thou&s;ands of hands; all the apparatus being made, and the ve&s;&s;els fitted out in our own country.</P>

</LIST>
<P>From the&s;e outfits the country evidently derives real advantages, whereas tho&s;e immediately concerned ri&s;que their property, as has formerly been repre|&s;ented, that during a period of forty-&s;even years, fourteen millions have been lo&s;t in this traffick, be&s;ides the lo&s;s ari&s;ing from the decrea&s;e of capital.</P>
<P>The in&s;tances which have proved profitable to the owners are but few; great|er lo&s;&s;es are to be apprehended from the pre&s;ent high prices of all the nece&s;&s;a|ries and materials. To clear the expences of a voyage, each ve&s;&s;el mu&s;t at lea&s;t bring a return of fifteen thou&s;and guilders, exclu&s;ive of one thou&s;and guilders for in&s;urance, be&s;ides the yearly decrea&s;e of capital, which may be cal|culated on an average, at thirty thou&s;and guilders for every ve&s;&s;el completely equipped, making the &s;um of three million eight hundred and &s;eventy thou&s;and guilders for one hundred and twenty-nine ve&s;&s;els which have been fitted out this pre&s;ent year, and which mu&s;t each fetch out of the &s;ea twenty tons of net goods to clear them&s;elves. The pro&s;pect of doing this is very unfavorable, as all our neighbours u&s;e greater exertions in that trade than ever; to which they are encouraged by the aid of their re&s;pective governments, in particular the Briti&s;h, who allow forty &s;hillings &s;terling per ton to each ve&s;&s;el which is employed in the whale fi&s;hery; by which means the number of their whaling ve&s;&s;els have, &s;ince the year 1749, (when the bounty was granted) increa&s;ed from two to one hundred and nine ve&s;&s;els, which in the &s;pring 1775, &s;ailed from England and Scotland, mea&s;uring in the whole thirty-three thou&s;and three hundred and eighteen tons, and amounting, at forty &s;hillings per ton, to &s;ixty-&s;ix thou&s;and &s;ix hundred and thirty-&s;ix pounds, equal to &s;even hundred and thirty-two thou&s;and nine hundred and ninety-&s;ix guilders, which amounts upon an average to &s;ix thou&s;and &s;even hundred and twenty-five guilders for each ve&s;&s;el.</P>
<P>The fi&s;heries in Sweden and Denmark have al&s;o received additional &s;trength from the encouragements offered by their governments, without which they would have but little inducement to that trade; &s;o that in&s;tead of Holland for|merly exceeding all the other nations together in the whale fi&s;hery, <HI>they</HI> at pre&s;ent exceed the Dutch by one third in the number of ve&s;&s;els&mdash;nay, Eng|land alone now &s;ends out nearly as many ve&s;&s;els as Holland.</P>
<P>Another ob&s;tacle pre&s;ents it&s;elf with regard to the whale-bone trade. Of this article Holland formerly &s;hipped five-eighth parts to Great-Britain, of which &s;ale we are now deprived, on account of the high duty impo&s;ed on all foreign whale-bone imported into that kingdom, and which may be con&s;idered as an additional premium on the fi&s;hery of that nation, amounting commonly to fifty guilders per one hundred weight. Our exportation of whale oil is al&s;o on the decline. Hamburgh and Bremen receive great &s;upplies, partly from their own fi&s;heries and partly from England and Ru&s;&s;ia, &s;o as to be able to
<PB N="27" REF="023911_0026_0FC28E548CB4D2A8">
furni&s;h the greate&s;t part of Germany with that article. France and Spain are mo&s;tly &s;upplied from England; and as it has been always computed, that three-fourths of the product of our fi&s;heries are exported, the competition of tho&s;e and other rival nations will &s;carcely leave a foreign market for us: our own provinces and the river Rhine, will be our limits.</P>
<P>Another di&s;advantage ought not to pa&s;s unnoticed, which is, that the prices of the produce of the fi&s;heries are con&s;iderably reduced; the whale-bone of the late&s;t voyage having already been &s;old as low as ninety guilders or le&s;s, which gives a lo&s;s. Oil may al&s;o in ca&s;e of a &s;ucce&s;sful &s;ea&s;on, fall from &s;ixty to forty guilders per twelve &s;tekan (&s;ixty-three gallons); and in that ca&s;e, ve&s;&s;els that return with one half or two thirds of their cargo, mu&s;t &s;ink money.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the mo&s;t material circum&s;tances that impede the progre&s;s of our fi&s;heries. The effect of the premium granted by the Briti&s;h parliament has already been &s;everely felt by our Greenland fleets, having, &s;ince that period, decrea&s;ed one third in number.</P>
