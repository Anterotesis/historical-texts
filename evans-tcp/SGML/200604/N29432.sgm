<P>UPon the &s;erious Con&s;ideration of that Cloud of the Lords Anger wherewith he hath covered this Land, in the lengthening out of War, which is one of the &s;ore&s;t of Gods Judgments, witholding in a great mea&s;ure his ble&s;&s;ing and &s;ucce&s;s upon Coun&s;els and en|deavours for the recovery of our peace, whence very great Deva&s;tations in &s;undry parts of the Countrey hath en&s;ued, and more Calamity is threat|ned, and that righteou&s;ly for our aggravated Sins whereby the Lord our God hath been provoked, which &s;ins have been expre&s;&s;ed in &s;everal former Or|ders for days of Fa&s;ting &amp; Prayer that have been publi&s;hed; yet the&s;e &s;ins have not been turned from, but we are rather in the time of our di&s;tre&s;s tre&s;pa&s;&s;ing yet more again&s;t him: Spiritual Judgments are prevailing, hardne&s;s of heart upon very many, great Security, Oppre&s;&s;ion, Luxury, and the Pride of this Land te&s;tifying again&s;t us to our very faces, Exacerbation of &s;pirit (as in <HI>Ma&s;&s;ah</HI> and <HI>Meribah</HI>) breaking forth in &s;tead of that Humiliation that &s;hould appear in &s;uch a day of the Lords rebuke upon us, our refu&s;ing to hear and obey the voice of the Lord in the mouth of his Servants whome he hath &s;ent to preach in his Name: whence the Lord hath denyed to hear our &s;upplications, and &s;eemed to &s;hut out our prayer when we have cryed to him, and to threaten us for our worldline&s;s to drive us out of our worldly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and for leaving our fir&s;t love to remove the very Candle&s;ticks out of their place except we repent, and for our &s;infull heathenizing, to deli|ver us into the hand of the barberous Heathen round about us, and &s;o to clear up the righteou&s;ne&s;s of his Judgments before all the world; (if by what he hath already done &s;o dreadfully, and his threatning of further Judgments we will not fear him, nor receive in&s;truction, nor be reformed) in demon|&s;trating that (in ca&s;e we be ruined) it is we that lay this plea&s;ant land de&s;olate,</P>
<P>This Court doth appoint the &s;econd day of <HI>March</HI> next to be kept to a day of &s;olemn <HI>Humiliation, Fa&s;ting</HI> and <HI>Prayer</HI> by all the Inhabitants of this Ju|risdiction, re&s;pecting all ranks and orders among&s;t us both in Church and Commonwealth, who are hereby earne&s;tly exhorted to make humble con|fe&s;&s;ion of their &s;ins, throughly to amend their wayes and turn to the Lord with their whole hearts, that &s;o the Lord may be entreated for us, and for his Name &s;ake turned away from the fiercene&s;s of his great anger, &amp; that yet at length he may be plea&s;ed to go forth with, and give &s;ucce&s;s to &s;uch forces as are or may be &s;ent forth as a meanes under him for the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of the Enemy: And it is hereby ordered that &s;uch as cannot have &s;ea&s;onable notice hereof &s;hall and are hereby injoyned to keep the fifth day of the next following Week in &s;tead of the day abovenamed,</P>
