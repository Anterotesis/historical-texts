<L>ONCE more, my &s;oul, releas'd from &s;leep,</L>
<L>And all the horrors of terrific dreams,</L>
<L>I ri&s;e before the Sun; and here alone,</L>
<L>Amid&s;t this garden's &s;olitary walks,</L>
<L>Await the earlie&s;t beam, that from the ea&s;t,</L>
<L>May come, to u&s;her in approaching day:</L>
<L>Thrice haple&s;s day to me! For now the year,</L>
<L>Revolving thrice, has roll'd the &s;ea&s;ons round;</L>
<L>Since, in obedience to my father's will,</L>
<L>I yielded to the matrimonial yoke.</L>
<L>At each return of this unhappy day,</L>
<L>The &s;un (methinks) &s;hould be o'er&s;pread with clouds,</L>
<L>And &s;ympathizing nature rob'd in black.</L>
<L>Little, ah! little did I then conceive</L>
<L>The ills that haunt a <HI>mercenary match.</HI></L>
<L>I envy now the homele&s;s vagabond,</L>
<L>Who begs her daily bread from door to door;</L>
<L>For &s;urely &s;he is ble&s;t with &s;weet content:</L>
<L>While, in the harne&s;s of a nuptial vow,</L>
<L>I drag along the heavy lead of life,</L>
<L>Join'd with a partner, whom my &s;oul dete&s;ts.</L>
<L>Unthinking maid! Why did my tongue con&s;ent,</L>

<L>I gave my <HI>hand,</HI> though nature held my <HI>heart.</HI></L>

<L>Not very well, I fear. There's nothing well,</L>

<L>It is unwi&s;e, I find, to undertake;</L>

<L>No farther, Sir, than was within my power.</L>

<L>Come, dire de&s;pair, thou blacke&s;t imp of hell,</L>
<L>With all the plagues, that form thy cur&s;ed train,</L>
<L>Remor&s;e and envy, jealou&s;y and pain;</L>
<L>Come, from the realms of mi&s;ery below,</L>
<L>And take me down to everla&s;ting woe.</L>

<L>TO generous &s;ouls, who&s;e &s;entiments are right&punc;</L>
<L>The exerci&s;e of candour gives delight&punc;</L>
<L>But other per&s;ons, of a different make,</L>
<L>Rejoice to find and cen&s;ure a mi&s;take.</L>
<L>As every audience is compo&s;ed of the&s;e,</L>
<L>This evening's play mu&s;t con&s;equently plea&s;e:</L>
<L>For here are faults of almo&s;t every name,</L>
<L>That candour can forgive, or cen&s;ure blome.</L>
<L>Ye critics, then, and patrons of the &s;tage.</L>
<L>The ju&s;t re&s;iners of the pre&s;ent age,</L>
<L>Who fill, adorn and dignify the&s;e &s;eats,</L>
<L>Pray, grant this &s;avour, which your friend entreats;</L>
<L>Be good enough our foibles to excu&s;e,</L>
<L>Indulge the boldne&s;s of a youthfull mu&s;e,</L>
<L>And thus declare to each unbia&s;s'd mind,</L>
<L>That &s;kilful judges are mo&s;t freely kind.</L>
