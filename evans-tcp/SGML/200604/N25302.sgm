<HEAD>SINGULAR STORY OF FRANK LEESON.</HEAD>
<P>IT &s;ometimes happens that men, who make the mo&s;t dangerous deviations from the laws of &s;ociety, and the principles of virtue, in a great mea&s;ure owe their crimes to the very benevolence of their hearts; and that in the mid&s;t of all their guilt we find a dignity of &s;oul which commands our highe&s;t admiration.</P>
<P>Frank Lee&s;on, was the &s;on of a country gentleman in Ireland&punc; who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a little e&s;tate of about <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">00 pounds a year, but who, with that liberality of &s;entiment, &s;o particu|larly the characteri&s;tic of his nation, gave into an ho&s;pitality rather beyond the power of his circum&s;tances, and in promoting the happine&s;s of his friends, too frequently for|got a nece&s;&s;ary attention to his own; the con&s;equence may be ea&s;ily fore&s;een by the intelligent reader; old Mr. Lee&s;on was in|volved in perpetu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> difficulties, and was up|on the e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e of being thrown into pri&s;on, when he was &s;aved from a di&s;grace of that

nature by the extraordinary piety of his &s;on; Frank to a very excellent under&s;tanding joined a very amiable per&s;on; on which ac|count, a young lady with an independent fortune of 8000l. had long beheld him with a favourable e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e; but Frank being attached to another who&s;e beauty and merit were her only recommendations, had hitherto de|clined to profit by this lady's partiality; however, when he &s;aw there was no other method of &s;aving an infirm father and mother from poverty and bondage, the force of his filial affection got the better of his love; he tore him&s;elf from the woman of his &s;oul, and married the eight thou&s;and pounds: With this money, he paid off all the old gentlem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n's debts, and entered the world with a degree of reputation, con&s;iderably &s;uperiour to the generality of his acquaint|ance.</P>
<P>As nothing could &s;eparate Frank and his father, the old couple and the young lived for &s;ometime in the mo&s;t perfect &s;tate of har|mony under the &s;ame roof; and the &s;ever|ity of their former &s;ituation producing a nece&s;&s;ary regulation in their expences, they were every day ri&s;ing no le&s;s in opulence th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> in felicity, when an unexpected mi&s;|fortune le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t them in the moment of their ut<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mo&s;t &s;ecurity without &s;helter and without bread: Old Mr. Lee&s;on, finding his health

<P><PB N="6" REF="033533_0005_0FF778DBA92F07A0">On the arrival of our unfortunate family in town, young Mr. Lee&s;on applied him&s;elf indu&s;triou&s;ly to profit by his recommenda|tions; but alas, though he met with civility, he could obtain no relief&punc; every fre&s;h ap|plication gave him nothing but fre&s;h occa|&s;ion to lament the mi&s;erable pro&s;pect before him; and while he was continually cheering every bo&s;om at home with the &s;peedy expec|tation of hale<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">on days, he had nothing but de&s;pair in his own.

<P>Next morning, however, the robbery be|came noi&s;ed abroad, and to the great &s;ur|prize of every body a merchant of the fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;t character and fortune was apprehended for the fact and lodged in Newgate; on the earlie&s;t knowledge of this circum&s;tance, Frank immediately wrote to the innocent gentleman, de&s;iring him to be under no ap|prehen&s;ion, for if he was not honourably acquitted, the per&s;on actually guilty would on the day of trial appear in court, acknowl|edge his crime, and &s;urrender him&s;elf to the violated laws of his country; the gentleman naturally read his letter to every body, but though &s;uch as were his friends, talked of it as a mo&s;t extraordinary affair, the general|ity of people con&s;idered it as a de&s;pica|ble artifice, calculated to impo&s;e on the cre|dulity of the publick.

<HEAD>FLORIO.&mdash;an affecting STORY.</HEAD>
<P>THE parents of the unhappy youth, who&s;e &s;tory we are abut to relate, dwelt at S&mdash;, a little town in the County of N&mdash;, where his father, a man of great merit and &s;trict piety, officiated as curate, with an income of about fifty pounds a year. Florio was their only child, who being a lad of a &s;prightly genius, had &s;o far improv|ed by the unwearied a&s;&s;iduity of his father,
<PB N="11" REF="033533_0010_0FF778E7D66F7820">
as to be, in his twelfth year, a perfect ma&s;ter of the Latin tongue, and not entire|ly unacquainted with the Greek: Yet, great as his father's care was in in&s;tructing him in the&s;e points, it was &s;till far exceeded by a regard for his morals. He had imbibed the &s;eeds of virtue from his birth; and the af|fectionate father took every opportunity of improving them.</P>
<P>By the&s;e means the little family lived in the mo&s;t exalted happine&s;s, till the youth had attained his fourteenth year, when all their bli&s;s was de&s;troyed by no le&s;s a calami|ty than the death of the indulgent father; a mi&s;fortune which could only be alleviated by the re&s;ignation with which he met the hand of Providence. Nothing can be im|agined more affecting than the calmne&s;s of the father, and the inexpre&s;&s;ible grief of the mother and her &s;on. "The pains of death (exclaims the expiring hu&s;band) bring no ter<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">or with them: I die, relying with con|fidence on my ble&s;&s;ed Redeemer.

For you, my dear Florio (embrac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing his &s;on in an ec&s;ta&s;y of joy) I leave you expo&s;ed to the frowns of a malicio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> world; but I tru&s;t in the good|ne&s;s of your heart to &s;upport you under every

calamity: But let me recommend it to you, above all things, to remain dutiful to your mother, and, for my &s;ake, be to her both a &s;on and a hu&s;band, that &s;he may experience at the &s;ame time your duty and protection." He would have &s;aid more; but finding his &s;pirits faint, he ended with. "Remember the&s;e my la&s;t words when I am gone; a few minutes will remove me from you; adieu forever, adieu." He had &s;carce uttered the&s;e words, when with a Chri&s;tian calm|ne&s;s he expired.</P>
<P>His widow and her unfortunate orphan, con&s;oled each other as well as this important event would permit them. No grief could recal the departed parent; and they now began to turn their eyes on their own con|dition. A relation, who was a trade&s;man in Philadelphia, and had no family of his own, had often de&s;ired to have Florio to town in his father's life time, which the tender father could never be brought to com|ply with. However, on the news of the clergyman's death, the generous Altamont flew to S&mdash;, and prevailed on the afflict|ed mother to part with her &s;on, promi&s;ing to adopt him for his own. This was an unex|pected &s;troke to her; to lo&s;e her hu&s;band, and now to be deprived of her &s;on, was more than &s;he could well bear: But recol|lecting it was not in her power to make a
<PB N="13" REF="033533_0012_0FF778ECE1170DD8">
provi&s;ion for Florio equal to his merit, &s;he at length con&s;ented to Altamont's propo&s;als, who &s;et out &s;oon after for town, overjoyed with his adopted &s;on.</P>
<P>The mother, as &s;he had lived very frugal during the life of her hu&s;band, had &s;aved a little money, which, as her &s;on was &s;o well provided for, &s;he laid out in an e&s;tate, and, for the &s;ake of cheapne&s;s, retired farther in|to the country, where &s;he kept up a con|&s;tant corre&s;pondence with her &s;on, who&s;e dutiful letters were the greate&s;t comfort of her life.</P>
<P>Florio, daily experienced fre&s;h in&s;tances of the di&s;intere&s;ted friend&s;hip of his bene|f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ctor; and now the ble&s;&s;ings of pro&s;perity &s;eemed again to &s;mile upon him. His only &s;tudy was to plea&s;e his generous patron, who amply recompen&s;ed his a&s;&s;iduity by the mo&s;t grateful acknowledgments. In this manner he &s;pent near three years in the mo&s;t perfect felicity; but this bli&s;s was too great to be permanent.</P>
<P>The affairs of Altamont required his pre&s;|ence at a little e&s;tate he had in the country; and as he knew his bu&s;ine&s;s in town would be faithfully tran&s;acted by Florio, he propo&s;|ed &s;taying a month or two in the country; but not choo&s;ing to leave the care of his hou&s;e to a young woman, he invited the wid|ow of his friend Lothario to &s;tay in it during
<PB N="14" REF="033533_0013_0FF778EF749B5C88">
his ab&s;ence as he was certain he might depend on her prudence in managing his family.</P>
<P>Having thus &s;ettled every thing to his mind, the generous Altamont &s;et out on his intended journey with great &s;atisfaction; but alas! little dreamt of the dreadful chain of mi&s;eries which were &s;o &s;oon to follow.</P>
<P>The widow of Lothario was left with two &s;mall children, both boys, and a very &s;canty provi&s;ion to maintain them; one of them, however &s;urvived his father but a &s;hort time; the other was maintained by the genero&s;ity of &s;ome friends, at a boarding &s;chool in the country: Yet, notwith&s;tanding the expen&s;es of her children being taken off, the unfortu|nate Raphelia could &s;cacre &s;upport her&s;elf on her trifling income. This Altamont knew and for that rea&s;on invited her to the care of his hou&s;e.</P>
<P>She was naturally of an agreeable temper; and notwith&s;tanding all her misfortunes, the beauty of her face was not totally van|i&s;hed. Her affability &s;oon procured her the e&s;teem of Florio, which on her &s;ide was re|paid by the mo&s;t affectionate regard. She frequently with a flood of tears related to him the happine&s;s &s;he once enjoyed with her loved Lothario, and the mi&s;eries &s;he had &s;ince his death experienced. This could not fail of working on the benevolent di&s;po&s;ition of Florio; he endeavoured to
<PB N="15" REF="033533_0014_0FF778F2481B6C98">
con&s;ole her anxiety, but in vain; he remon&s;|trated to her the crime of murmuring at the di&s;pen&s;ations of Providence; but to that &s;he was entirely inattentive; and often, in the innocent &s;implicity of his heart, knelt down before her, and earne&s;tly reque&s;ted her, in that moving po&s;ture, to de&s;i&s;t from her unea&s;ine&s;s. This goodne&s;s &s;erved only to increa&s;e, in&s;ted of alleviating, the grief of Raphelia. She rai&s;ed up the compa&s;&s;ion|ate youth, and tenderly embracing him, re|turned him her mo&s;t grateful thanks for his pity, the tears trickling all the while from both their eyes. This friend&s;hip imper|ceptibly increa&s;ed into the mo&s;t ardent love. But now, reader, it is time to throw a veil on the&s;e unhappy lovers. Let it &s;uffice to &s;ay that in an ill fated hour they were both ruined, though it is hard to tell which was the &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ducer, or which the &s;educed. In &s;hort, they indulged their criminal love till the return of Altamont, who, in his jour|ney, had paid a vi&s;it to the mother of Florio, and greatly comforted her with the character he gave of the promi&s;ing youth her &s;on.</P>
<P>The intrigue of Florio had never been &s;u&s;pected by the &s;ervants, as the age of Ra|phelia gave a &s;anction to any little liberty taken before them. Upon Altamont's arri|val, and inquiry into the &s;tate of his affairs, he found all his bu&s;ine&s;s had been exactly
<PB N="16" REF="033533_0015_0FF778F496756B90">
performed according to his directions; nor was he le&s;s plea&s;ed with a review of the do|me&s;tick care of Raphelia, which he ac|knowledged by a hand&s;ome pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>Though &s;he was now removed from Flo|rio, he &s;till pur&s;ued her to her lodgings, un|known to Altamont or his family; till one evening when he went as u&s;ual, he found her in tears. This he could not bear, and immediately reque&s;ted the rea&s;on of them: But judge, reader, what mu&s;t be his &s;urpri&s;e, when &s;he declared her&s;elf pregnant! This was a thought which had entered neither of their heads, &s;he thinking her&s;elf &s;ecure by age, and he by youth. They were now di&s;|tre&s;&s;ed indeed; but as one crime u&s;ually brings on another, he re&s;olved to fly from the &s;hame which he &s;aw approaching. Di&s;|&s;embling his mind, however, before her, (a thing which till then he had never been guilty of) he endeavoured to comfort her as well as he could, promi&s;ing to call on her the nex day.</P>
<P>He left the room, but without intending ever to &s;ee it again; and immediatly fled his native country, and arrived at Bri&s;tol, where he entered on board a privateer, fit|ting out for the We&s;tindies. They had not been out long, before they met with a French frigate, which the captain re&s;olved to board. Florio, de&s;perate with affliction, was per|mitted
<PB N="17" REF="033533_0016_0FF778F61B64EC98">
to be of the number appointed to board her, and &s;oon appeared upon the deck of the Frenchman, where, overpowered by numbers, he at la&s;t received a mortal wound, though not before he had given &s;everal him|&s;elf. The &s;urgeon in vain endeavoured to bleed him, he was too far gone for a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and &s;oon after expired. On &s;earching his che&s;t, a letter was found directed to Alta|mont, filled with the mo&s;t grateful acknowl|edgments for all his kindne&s;s, and acquaint|ing him with the rea&s;ons of his elopement. This was conveyed to him&punc; and the news &s;oon reached the ears of the unfortunate Raphelia, who looking on her&s;elf as the cau&s;e of his death, took the horrid re&s;olution of de&s;troying both her&s;elf and her unborn infant by poi&s;on, thinking to expiate her guilt by the horrid cr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">me of &s;uicide.</P>

<HEAD>STORY OF EDWARD AND MARIA.</HEAD>
<P>"MY father had two children, a daughter and my&s;elf. Anxious for our im|provement, he injudiciou&s;ly conceived, that the fir&s;t duty incumbent upon every parent was that of be&s;towing a genteel education on his children. Accordingly he &s;ent us to the mo&s;t re&s;pectable &s;chools he could &s;e|lect, where we received in&s;tructions that would have enabled us to have appeared in the highe&s;t &s;phere of life. My father, who was a woollen draper, upon my leaving &s;chool, di&s;clo&s;ed to me his intention of bind|ing me apprentice to him&s;elf, and intending me as his &s;ucce&s;&s;or; but my vanity revolted at the idea. I was &s;hocked beyond concep|tion, and left my father's pre&s;ence with evi|dent &s;igns of anger and di&s;approbation. He now di&s;covered his folly, and repented that he had be&s;towed on me an education from which I had imbibed principles &s;o repug|nant to a &s;ituation I conceived derogatory of my character. But repentance&punc; he found, was fruitle&s;s; and all his men<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters"> and &s;olic|itations

proving ineffectual, he &s;ent me to the Ea&s;t-Indies, through the intere&s;t and re|commendations of &s;ome of his friends, in the capacity of a writer. Poverty, &s;eemed preferable to the &s;ituation of a mechanick. I joyfully accepted of the place, and at length, by &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, became a &s;enior mer|chant, in which &s;tation riches poured in up|on me un&s;olicited.</P>
<P>"Having obtained an affluent fortune, I returned to my own country, after an ab|&s;ence of twenty five years. The fir&s;t inqui|ry, you mu&s;t naturally imagine, I made on my return, was after my father and &s;i&s;ter: (my mother, I &s;hould have told you, died when we were infants) the former, I heard, had &s;ome time &s;ince fallen a victim to afflic|tion: and how great was my a&s;toni&s;hment when I heard that my &s;i&s;ter had been the fatal cau&s;e of it, by a mi&s;erable pro&s;titution of her per&s;on! In vain I made u&s;e of every channel of information for the recovery of my poor wretched Maria. Every attempt to gain any knowledge of her was vain, and her fate might perhaps have remained un|known to me till this day, had not chance directed me to her.</P>
<P>"As I returned home from the convivial|ity of &s;ome friends one night, a little intox|icated, with others in the &s;ame &s;ituation as my&s;elf, having ill treated a man who had

expo&s;tulated with us for di&s;turbing the neighbourhood at &s;o late an hour, we were conducted to the watch hou&s;e, where I &s;hortly heard the groan of a female in an adjoining room. My mind was &s;till &s;u&s;|ceptible of pity; and though almo&s;t over|come by the power of wine, my &s;en&s;ations were equally tender.</P>
<P>"A pre&s;cence of mind, or &s;ome in&s;tinc|tive power, induced me to inquire into the &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">uation of the mi&s;erable object.

I earne&s;tly en|treated him to lead me to the unfortunate woman before &s;he breathed her la&s;t. He con&s;ented. But what was my a&s;toni&s;hment and &s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ations when I recogni&s;ed, in this almo&s;t expiring obj<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ct of pity and mi&s;ery, my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, long lo&s;t Maria!

<P>"When I had recovered a little from the horrors which enveloped me, I laid the dead corp&s;e on the bed, and &s;carcely could my friends di&s;entangle me from the body. I re|mained &s;ome time in a &s;tate of &s;tupefaction, and was lamenting that &s;he had not been able to recount the tale of her mi&s;eries, that I might be revenged on her &s;educer, when the keeper's wife interrupted my lamenta|tion by informing me, that my &s;i&s;ter had briefly di&s;clo&s;ed to her, a few moments be|fore my entering, the &s;ource of all her wretchedne&s;s. "It originated," &s;he &s;aid, "from the well-meaning but fal&s;e ideas of her father. An education that he had be|&s;towed on her &s;uperior to her humble &s;itua|tion, continually harra&s;&s;ed her mind with fal&s;e notions of vanity, which were the fir&s;t motives that induced her to a&s;pire to the a&s;|&s;ociation of a woman eminently her &s;uperior, and with whom &s;he had formed an intimate connection at &s;chool. A heart like her's, envenomed by that de&s;tructive poi&s;on&punc; <HI>pride,</HI> and &s;o nicely &s;u&s;ceptible of the tender pa&s;|&s;ion, could not long with&s;tand the &s;educing arts that were &s;o a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly &s;pread to en|&s;nare her v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rtue.

added &s;he, "I fell a victim to my own vanity, the foundation of which was innocently laid by my poor father."</P>
<P>"Thus, in a watch hou&s;e, ended the mi&s;|erable exi&s;tence of a woman who&s;e heart be|ing fundamentally good and virtuous, might have formed an u&s;eful and re&s;pectable mem|ber of &s;ociety, a tender wife, and an affec|tionate mother, had not her brain been in|toxicated by the effects of a fal&s;e education."</P>

<HEAD>THE GENEROSITY OF AN <HI>INJURED DAUGHTER.</HI></HEAD>
<P>FILIAL piety is a flower of &s;o delicate a nature, that we meet but very few plac|es which can produce it; and though we frequently hear of parents who ruin them|&s;elves for the &s;ake of their children, yet, we &s;eldom or ever hear of children, who do any extraordinary acts of kindne&s;s to their par|ents. Perhaps nature has formed the par|ental &s;en&s;ibility, infinitely more exqui&s;ite than the filial, and, for &s;ome wi&s;e purpo&s;e, implanted a much greater fondne&s;s on our minds for tho&s;e we beget and educate, than for tho&s;e by whom we are begotten and ed|ucated our&s;elves; at lea&s;t cu&s;tom has firmly e&s;tabli&s;hed &s;uch different &s;entiments relative to the behavour of parent and child, that it
<PB N="23" REF="033533_0022_0FF7790891BF4A08">
is thought a matter of the highe&s;t prai&s;e in a wealthy &s;on to &s;ettle a paltry fifty pound for life on a di&s;tre&s;&s;ed and worthy father; but an action of little or no merit in a father to &s;ettle twenty times the &s;um upon an in|digent &s;on. I &s;upped la&s;t night at my &s;i&s;ter Rattle's, where I generally hear &s;omething new, and was entertained by my nephew Harry, with the following exception to the foregoing po&s;ition, which I flatter my&s;elf will prove no di&s;agreeable relation to my readers.</P>
<P>An eminent merchant, who&s;e name I think nece&s;&s;ary to conceal under that of Webley, married a mo&s;t amiable woman, with whom he received a con&s;iderable fortune, and by whom he was ble&s;t in the fir&s;t year with a daughter, called Marria: Mrs. Webley however unhappily catching a cold during the time of her lying in, did not long &s;urvive the birth of her child, but died in about three months after; with her la&s;t breath conjuring her hu&s;band to be particularly at|tentive to the welfare of the unfortunate little Maria.</P>
<P>Mr. Webley for two years before his mar|riage had been connected with a &s;ubtle de|&s;igning woman, by whom he al&s;o had a daughter, nor did his having a wife put an end to the guilty intercour&s;e: Under pre|tence of important bu&s;ine&s;s, he frequently
<PB N="24" REF="033533_0023_0FF7790B07513AE0">
&s;taid in town with her a night or two in the week, while Mrs. Webley was down at the country hou&s;e in Hertford&s;hire; and as frequently carried her into the country with him, whenever he knew his lady could not conveniently leave town:&mdash; His marriage, in fact, was rather an engagement of intere&s;t, than a union of inclination; and Mrs. Webley's fortune enabling him to live up to the &s;ummit of his wi&s;hes, the moment &s;he was interred, he thought there was no far|ther nece&s;&s;ity for re&s;traint or di&s;gui&s;e.&mdash; In &s;hort, &s;ix weeks had &s;carcely elap&s;ed, when he married the abandoned woman we have been &s;peaking of, and pitched upon the mo&s;t profligate of her &s;ex, to &s;upply the place of the very be&s;t.</P>
<P>We &s;hall pa&s;s over the time of Maria's infancy, when &s;he experienced little more than the diminutive cruelty of a narrow minded mother in law, and come at once to that period which may be ju&s;tly reckoned the mo&s;t important of her life: She had ju&s;t entered on her eighteenth year, and was blooming into all the perfections of her &s;ex, when Mrs. Webley began to think of exe|cuting a &s;cheme which &s;he had long in agi|tation.&mdash;She &s;aw Maria treated by every body with the greate&s;t re&s;pect, and beheld her own daughter, though dre&s;t out in all the fa&s;hionable &s;oppery of the times, and in|finitely
<PB N="25" REF="033533_0024_0FF7790D92FB3508">
more attended to, received with a degree of in&s;ipid civilty, that bordered up|on contempt. The &s;hameful neglect which Maria experienced at home, gave a con&s;tant lu&s;tre to her merit when abroad, and if &s;he found no kind of countenance in her own family, &s;he met with the highe&s;t in every other place.&mdash;This was a circum&s;tance which galled Mrs. Webley to the very &s;oul, and being moreover fearful that the regard &s;o univer&s;ally &s;hewn to Maria, would be a means of ob&s;tructing any favourable ad|dre&s;&s;es which might be made to her own daughter, &s;he took a &s;peedy opportunity of quarrelling with that unhappy young lady, and being as the generality of tho&s;e of her principles mo&s;t commonly are, both ma&s;ter and mi&s;tre&s;s of the hou&s;e, very fairly turn|ed her out of doors. Maria was not how|ever de&s;titute of a protector, though &s;he had lo&s;t a father. A young fellow, with a good under&s;tanding and a &s;plendid e&s;tate, who had long &s;olicited her favourable opinion, and gained it, took that opportunity of pre&s;&s;ing for her hand, and was made the hap|pie&s;t of men.</P>
<P>Maria was married about five years, dur|ing which time, though &s;he had often en|treated for a reconciliation, &s;he never could be admitted to the pre&s;ence of her father; when taking up the Gazette, one Saturday

evening, &s;he met with his name among&s;t the li&s;t of bankrupts, and in&s;tantly fainted on the floor: She was however &s;oon brought to her&s;elf, when forgetting in a moment how &s;he had been turned out upon the char|ity of an inho&s;pitable world, and expo&s;ed to the mo&s;t pinching poverty and di&s;grace: how for a &s;eries of years &s;he had been treat|ed as an alien to her father's family, and even denied the mo&s;t trivial nece&s;&s;aries, while &s;trangers were rioting on her mother's fortune; &s;he flew to her hu&s;band, who&s;e happine&s;s was centered in obliging her, and pointing out the mi&s;erable &s;ituation of her father, obtained his con&s;ent to &s;ettle three hundred a year out of a &s;um which he would allow her for pin money, on him, to alleviate &s;o di&s;tre&s;&s;ing an incident: With this &s;he immediately took coach, and proceeded to her father's; the door was now thrown open at her approach; and being introduc|ed to the old gentleman's pre&s;ence, they gazed upon one another for &s;ome moments, and then bur&s;t into a mutual flood of tears.</P>
<P>Mr. Webley's misfortunes had opened his eyes to the &s;trangene&s;s of his conduct, and nobody could be more ready to con|demn it than him&s;elf. What then mu&s;t we judge his emotions to be, when a daughter, whom he had le&s;t de&s;titute of bread, came to offer him a genteel allowance for life;

and the &s;ame eyes which he had &s;teeped in tears of the keene&s;t di&s;tre&s;s, came to fill his with drops of unutterable joy; his grati|tude as a man, his feelings as a father, in|&s;tantly ru&s;hed upon his &s;oul; he dryed his eyes, looked full in his daughter's face for &s;ome moments, then capering about the room with the phrenzy of a bedlamite, bur&s;t afre&s;h into tears. Suffice it, however, that after his affairs were &s;ettled, he retired into the country, upon this yearly allowance, but did not live long enough to enjoy the fir&s;t quarter: The mortification of being a bankrupt, the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of his family errors, and finally, the very genero&s;ity of his daughter, which was intended to &s;weeten the remainder of his life, proved a means of hurrying him to his end: The agitation of his mind threw the gout into his &s;tomach, and he died in Maria's arms, in the fiftieth year of his age. His wife and daughter now thought them&s;elves utterly undone! but Maria, with a greatne&s;s of mind peculiar to her&s;elf, in an in&s;tant di&s;pelled their appre|hen&s;ions by a continuation of two hundred a year, during her life; and without ever &s;tooping to hint any thing of their former behaviour, told them, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> they mu&s;t con|&s;ider it as no compliment, &s;ince &s;he looked upon it as an indi&s;pen&s;ible duty, which &s;he ought to pay to the memory of her father.</P>

<P>Leonora had a brother to whom &s;he was dear as life; &s;he had a lover too who was his intimate friend, and for this lover &s;he en|tertained a &s;incere pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>This gentleman, whom we &s;hall call Al|bertus, was left by his father in rather in|digent circum&s;tances; but Lorenzo, the brother of Leonora, who had formed an at|tachment to him at &s;chool, by purcha&s;e, though he pretended it was by intere&s;t, pro|cured him a civil employment, &s;ufficiently competent to &s;upport a gentleman.</P>
<P>Albertus &s;pent all his lei&s;ure hours at the hou&s;e of his friend, and the amiable virtues of Leonora, which animated a beautiful face, &s;oon &s;ubdued his heart by their powerful influence.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="033533_0028_0FF77917E9DC4B18">Gratitude combated &s;trongly with pa&s;&s;ion. The obligations he owed Lorenzo, made him re&s;olve forever to quit the pre&s;ence of Leonora, yet he could not prevail on him&s;elf to depart without communicating the cau&s;e.</P>
<P>This was a trial which required the utmo&s;t exertions of fortitude: but accident &s;oon produced an opportunity.</P>
<P>Albertus &s;itting one morning in a parlour with Leonora, &s;he received a letter from her brother, which as &s;he peru&s;ed, her hands trembled, her face flu&s;hed, and at la&s;t over|powered by &s;en&s;ibility, &s;he fainted, and fell pro&s;trate upon a couch on which &s;he fat.</P>

<P>Leonora on recovering was overwhelmed with confu&s;ion, nor was Albertus in a le&s;s pitiable &s;ituation.

She was not &s;uch a novice in the knowledge of human nature, as to be ignorant of the effect of beauty, and the agitation of Albertus might have been the con&s;equence of &s;en&s;ual pa&s;&s;ion. She therefore put the letter in his hand&mdash;he read, he &s;ighed&mdash;he looked on her, and wept.</P>

<P>This letter was from the brother of Leo|nora. It informed her that a per&s;on of great fortune had propo&s;ed a tender of his heart.</P>

<HEAD>THE NEW PYGMALION. A NOVEL.</HEAD>
<P>A YOUNG gentleman of rank and for|tune, in one of his morning walks through Paris, was &s;truck with the appear|ance of a beautiful little creature that was earning her daily pittance by traver&s;ing the &s;treets for cinders! Notwith&s;tanding &s;he was in tatters, and disfigured with du&s;t, her eyes were brilliant and expre&s;&s;ive. The youth was captivated with &s;o uncommon an object, and his humanity pleaded powerful|ly in her favour. What, &s;aid he to him&s;elf, &s;hould hinder me of being &s;erviceable to this unhappy object! Perhaps her per&s;on might make her fortune; I &s;hould then make two happy. After this &s;hort &s;oliloquy he enquired where her parents lived? She replied, I am an orphan, Sir; a neighbour took me into her hou&s;e, and I endeavour to get a bit of bread that I may not be &s;ent to the workhou&s;e.</P>
<P>But you would be much better there than as you are now.</P>
<P>O Sir, one of my companions, who is there, &s;ays, &s;he would rather &s;tarve than be obliged to live in &s;uch a place. Well, my

child, if you like it, I will take care of you in future; I will provide you a mi&s;tre&s;s, who &s;hall cloathe and in&s;truct you in &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s more creditable; and all I require of you is, to profit by the expen&s;e I &s;hall be at on your account.</P>
<P>The little creature, delighted with the offer, begs to &s;hew him her hou&s;e. He ac|companies her to a fruiterer's, where he learnt her docility and application. This poor, but indu&s;trious woman, had taken care to have her taught reading and writing; and here he found that this orphan was the daughter of an exci&s;eman, who died in ex|treme indigence, and that her name was Loui&s;a Pa&s;&s;ementier.</P>
<P>Our new Pygmalion plea&s;ed with this in|formation, intimated his views re&s;pecting Loui&s;a, agreed to allow her a certain annual &s;um for the time &s;he had taken this orphan into her hou&s;e, and ordered her to be de|cently cloathed.</P>
<P>The man who has found a valuable dia|mond incru&s;ted with dirt, could not be more overjoyed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">han the protector of Loui&s;a, when he &s;aw her clean, and under the hands of the mantua maker.

<PB N="39" REF="033533_0037_0FF7792E4D2E34E0">
per&s;on who had made her &s;o happy. Mr. De M &mdash; was delighted. He &s;ignified his plea&s;ure of breakfa&s;ting with Loui&s;a and the two women; he then conducted her to a reputable milliner's where &s;he found a new mi&s;tre&s;s, that was the modle of ta&s;te, regularity, and good breeding.</P>
<P>Madam, &s;aid Mr. De M &mdash;, I here bring you a young apprentice. Be not &s;ur|pri&s;ed that &s;he is unaccompanied by a wo|man; &s;he is an orphan, and I, who am her guardian, am &s;till a bachelor. In placing her under your care and in&s;tructions. I give you all the authority of a parent. I re&s;ign to you all m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ne, only re&s;erving that of pay|ing you liberally for your expen&s;e and trouble. I wi&s;h her to be treated upon the &s;ame footing as your own children. I have not a doubt but you will find her worthy your attentions, and that &s;he will love your daughters as if they were her &s;i&s;ters. In taking his leave he ob&s;erved to this lady, that he &s;hould never de&s;ire to &s;ee her alone, or to take her out unle&s;s accompanied by her or her daughters. This arrangement meeting the entire approbation of her mi&s;|tre&s;s, Loui&s;a was immediately taken into her family and highly care&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>Mr. De M&mdash; had declined taking with him the fruiterer and mantua m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ker, in order that it might not be known the
<PB N="40" REF="033533_0038_0FF7793094EDB250">
&s;tate of mi&s;ery in which he had found this unfortunate orphan. He was &s;ome time without &s;eeing his adopted ward, and upon his paying the &s;econd quarter for her board, he was &s;urpri&s;ed with her progre&s;s. She had already acquired an air, which render|ed her pretty face &s;till more intere&s;ting; and her mode&s;ty in &s;eeing her benefactor, gave her additional charms.</P>
<P>Mr. De M &mdash; could not help exclaim|ing to him&s;elf, happy Pygmalion! The gods animated thy &s;tatue; render them divine honours, and re&s;pect their pre&s;ent! He then &s;eated him&s;elf oppo&s;ite to Loui&s;a, and con|ver&s;ed with her in the re&s;pectful language of a guardian to his ward, in order to in&s;pire her with an elevation of &s;entiment. In a private conver&s;ation, her mi&s;tre&s;s &s;aid &s;he was a trea&s;ure of beauty, &s;en&s;e, and &s;en&s;ibility. Loui&s;a, &s;ir, is all &s;weetne&s;s and conde&s;cen|&s;ion. She &s;eems thoroughly &s;en&s;ible that &s;he owes her pre&s;ent happine&s;s to your atten|tions. Her addre&s;s is uncommon and gra|cious; and her docility and comprehen&s;ion &s;urpri&s;ing for her age. Mr. De M &mdash; left the hou&s;e in a kind of rapture. Happy Pygmalion! What a beautiful &s;tatue has the bounty of the gods animated by thy care and a&s;&s;iduity!</P>
<P>The following evening he was &s;omething earlier in his vi&s;it; and brought with him a pretty pre&s;ent, con&s;i&s;ting of a pair of ear+rings,
<PB N="41" REF="033533_0039_0FF7793329DC0C98">
a necklace, a pair of bracelets, with a pair of hand&s;ome &s;hoebuckles, inclo&s;ed in an etui made of gold.</P>
<P>I wi&s;h, Mi&s;s Loui&s;a, to give you an in|&s;tance of my friend&s;hip, by pre&s;enting you with the&s;e trifles; and by &s;o doing I hope to gain a place in your's.</P>
<P>You have no nece&s;&s;ity, &s;ir, to have re|cour&s;e to &s;uch expedients, &s;ince the favours I have already received, will never be effac|ed from my memory.</P>
<P>You are, I believe, as good as you are lovely. I often &s;peak of you to Mi&s;s Hen|rietta Monclar, (her mi&s;tre&s;s elde&s;t daugh|ter) &s;he &s;ays you are my guardian angel; and were I to tell her all&mdash;</P>
<P>No, Loui&s;a; that &s;ecret mu&s;t remain where it is. You mu&s;t forget it as fa&s;t as you can.</P>
<P>Forget it, &s;ir! That's impo&s;&s;ible. If I dared to tell you what I think &mdash;</P>
<P>Why not, my dear Loui&s;a?</P>
<P>It is, &s;ir, that for &s;ome months pa&s;t, on re|flecting on the &s;tate from which you have taken me, I tremble with horror; particu|larly &s;o, when I compare it with my pre&s;ent &s;ituation.</P>
<P>The&s;e reflections are &s;ingular for one of your age, Loui&s;a.</P>
<P>I had a mother, &s;ir, that was as kind as &s;he was affectionate, and was very capable
<PB N="42" REF="033533_0040_0FF7793592BB0F28">
of bringing me up; and I &s;till remember tho&s;e things &s;he taught me.</P>
<P>My dear little maid, open your e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ui, and &s;ee what I have given you. She opens and examines every thing.</P>
<P>Ah, &s;ir! This is too fine for a poor or|phan.</P>
<P>If the&s;e articles are too fine for an orphan, they are not &s;o for my daughter&mdash;yes, Lou|i&s;a, it is the name my heart avows; and &s;ince I have taken the title of father, I &s;hall mo&s;t &s;edulou&s;ly di&s;charge all its duties. Be there|fore free from any inquietudes; your hap|pine&s;s will be a duty and a plea&s;ure to me.</P>
<P>Mr. De M&mdash;, admiring the work he had undertaken, could not refrain from articu|lating&mdash;Heavens! how beautiful is that creature grown! If I had ever &s;een &s;o love|ly an object among the circle of my acquaint|ance, could I refrain from adoring her?</P>
<P>The next day an unexpected affair prevent|ed him from &s;eeing Loui&s;a. He was obliged to &s;et out immediately for one of his e&s;tates in the country, where his pre&s;ence was ab&s;o|lutely nece&s;&s;ary. Here he was detained for &s;ix months; and during this interval, he received no le&s;s than two letters from his ward, inclo&s;ed in th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e of her mi&s;tre&s;s.</P>

<P>Mr. De M&mdash; was extremely affected with his ward's attachment. As &s;oon as his affairs were &s;ufficiently arranged, he ha&s;ten|ed back to the capital, where he found Lou|i&s;a in the blooming charms of all conquer|ing fifteen. Her beauty now made a forci|ble impre&s;&s;ion upon his heart. He felt its powers, and began to feel its con&s;equences. His vi&s;its became more &s;eldom, yet he could not dive&s;t him&s;elf of his feelings. Loui&s;a, on her part, became pa&s;&s;ionately fond of her protector; and as &s;he &s;aw no harm in giv|ing way to her penchant, &s;he expre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf, on all occa&s;ions, with a <HI>naievete</HI> that was irre&s;i&s;tibly &s;eductive.</P>
<P>One evening, after a &s;erious reflection, Mr. De M&mdash;appeared in the pre&s;ence of Loui&s;a, with a cloud hanging on his brow. She drew near to him, and with an accent of the livelie&s;t concern, &s;aid, dear &s;ir, you &s;eem to have &s;ome cau&s;e of unea&s;ine&s;s&mdash; would to heaven I could relieve you from it&mdash;</P>
<P>Loui&s;a, my dear Loui&s;a, it quits me when I &s;ee your; but it returns when I am going to leave you.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="033533_0043_0FF7793C310F5B50">Ah, dear papa! do not then leave me.&mdash;</P>
<P>That's impo&s;&s;ible</P>
<P>No, that is not impo&s;&s;ible. I am yours, I only live, I only breathe, but to be in&s;tru|mental to your happine&s;s.</P>
<P>Lovely creature! Can a daughter at your age content her&s;elf with living in my hou&s;e?</P>
<P>Why not, &s;ir? Cannot I live with my papa&mdash;if it be nece&s;&s;ary for his repo&s;e&mdash;</P>
<P>Loui&s;a, you are too dear to me, that I &s;hould &s;o expo&s;e your reputation.</P>
<P>My reputation&mdash;dear &s;ir, explain what you mean.</P>
<P>Loui&s;a, thou art my child, and yet I dare not take thee under my roof. Hear me, dear Loui&s;a, hear me. I have a name, a title, and a large e&s;tate; my rank requires that I make an alliance with a family of equal preten&s;ions; and to make a marriage &s;tate happy, it is nece&s;&s;ary to love the per&s;on to whom one is united, and I can love no other woman than my Loui&s;a. This is the rea&s;on why I am a prey to inquietude. My Loui&s;a, I adore thee&mdash;thou art the work of my hands; I have, in fact, called thee into exi&s;tence; and I love thee as a father, a brother, and a lover. I &s;hall be wretched without thee; I &s;hall be a mon&s;ter if I abu&s;e thy innocence; and, if I marry thee, my family will hold me in execration. This is my &s;ituation, thou too bewitching creature.
<PB N="46" REF="033533_0044_0FF7794096127B70">
Pity me; it is all that thy too enamoured friend reque&s;ts.</P>
<P>During this di&s;cour&s;e, Loui&s;a was a prey to a thou&s;and new ideas; &s;he &s;carce compre|hended the l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nguage of her protector; it was, to her, a chaos of incoherent &s;entiments.</P>
<P>Can I po&s;&s;ibly make him wretched who has rendered me &s;o completely happy! Can I then do nothing for him who has treated me as his daughter! Certainly I can; but you conceal it from me through a motive of genero&s;ity. Will you not then relieve me from this cruel perplexity;&mdash;</P>
<P>Loui&s;a, my kind Loui&s;a, my affectionate daughter, &s;ince you are the choice of my heart, be tranquillized; my rea&s;on will &s;ug|ge&s;t a remedy for my pre&s;ent &s;ituation.&mdash; Adieu, I will &s;ee you again tomorrow.</P>
<P>Mr. De M&mdash; after this vi&s;it was plung|ed into a painful irre&s;olution.</P>
<P>Shall I marry Loui&s;a! My heart &s;ays yes; but the world, rea&s;on, prudence, the age in which I live, put a negative to the mea&s;ure. My family, my relations, my friends, oppo&s;e &s;uch an union.</P>
<P>In&s;tead of flying from the object of his affection, he re&s;olved to &s;ee her every day, and accu&s;tom him&s;elf to her poi&s;on, in order to bid defiance to its malignity. And thus he rea&s;oned: Loui&s;a is a fever; this di&s;or|der &s;hould then be treated as &s;uch. The be|ginning
<PB N="47" REF="033533_0045_0FF7794219E29640">
is in a manner imperceptible, but the cri&s;is violent in the la&s;t degree; after this it dimini&s;hes in&s;en&s;ibly. I mu&s;t then &s;uffer with courage; the victory will be crowned with happy con&s;equences, and there will be left no room for repentance!</P>
<P>This line of conduct being adopted, Mr. De M&mdash; was regular in his vi&s;its; and Loui&s;a was the happie&s;t of women. The pa&s;&s;ion made a rapid progre&s;s in the heart of the guardian; who endeavoured, like a phi|lo&s;opher, to combat its efforts.</P>
<P>This conduct of the guardian and his ward, &s;oon opened the eyes of Madam Mon|clar. Loui&s;a made no my&s;tery of her in|clinations; on the contrary, all her words and actions demon&s;trated the fervour of her feelings. In his ab&s;ence, her &s;ighs, her tears, revealed the &s;tate of her heart, and her joy was no le&s;s con&s;picuous in &s;eeing him.&mdash; That bo&s;om, virtuous and &s;u&s;ceptible, was alive to all the ardour of the mo&s;t glowing pa&s;&s;ion, united to gratitude, e&s;teem, re&s;pect, and attachment.</P>
<P>My dear child, &s;aid Madam Monclar, I fear you love too well your guardian. Take care! for his partiality may one day be|come fatal to your repo&s;e.</P>
<P>Ah, madam! that cannot be; for every thing which relates to Mr. De M&mdash; mu&s;t be in&s;trumental to my happine&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="033533_0046_0FF77944DA03BAA0">But child, he may be induced to marry.</P>
<P>If madam, he &s;hould experience his felicity in that &s;tate, I &s;hall rejoice in his good fortune. In that ca&s;e he might per|haps be induced to make me a companion to his lady, whom I &s;hould love with the greate&s;t tenderne&s;s.</P>
<P>If the&s;e are your &s;entiments, Loui&s;a, I have nothing farther to &s;ay.</P>
<P>This conver&s;ation was related to Mr. De M&mdash; word for word. He confe&s;&s;ed the ardour of his affection, yet was irre&s;olute in the conduct he ought to pur&s;ue.</P>
<P>To make her my wife is certainly the noble&s;t procedure&mdash;and perhaps the mo&s;t prudent, &s;ince my happine&s;s hinges on the event. But my family&mdash;the world&mdash;the court, will &s;ee with different eyes. She has an hone&s;t parentage, and if I were but a private gentleman, I could marry her with|out &s;lander or detraction: As I am now &s;it|uated, my heir&s;hip to titles and di&s;tinctions, requires that I make choice of a woman a|mong the higher order of <HI>noble&s;&s;e,</HI> or one who&s;e riches can ca&s;t a veil upon her orig|inal ob&s;curity. Strange and unnatural pre|judice!

line of life, is deemed unworthy of my regards.</P>

<P>That heart, madam, will in&s;tantly declare in favour of Loui&s;a. But I will con&s;ult this lovely creature in per&s;on; I will &s;hew her what can be &s;aid for and again&s;t a mea&s;|ure of this nature; and by this means I &s;hall hear the advice of beautiful nature in all her purity.</P>
<P>Having &s;aid this, he de&s;ired to &s;peak with Loui&s;a in private.</P>

<P>Mr. De M &mdash; embraced the fir&s;t oppor|tunity of &s;peaking to his lady relative to

his adopted daughter, who readily &s;econded his views, by reque&s;ting he would bring her home as &s;oon as he thought proper.</P>
<P>Lady De M&mdash; received Loui&s;a with every mark of re&s;pect and e&s;teem. She was about the &s;ame age, lately come from a con|vent, and therefore con&s;idered her vi&s;itor as an agreeable companion, without the lea&s;t mixture of jealou&s;y of her charms, &s;ince her per&s;on was equally hand&s;ome and attractive.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t eight days this young family pa&s;&s;ed in the mo&s;t agreeable manner po&s;|&s;ible; but this harmony was interrupted by the Counte&s;s, who ob&s;erved the great famil|iarity that pa&s;&s;ed between the&s;e beautiful women, and taking her daughter a&s;ide, &s;aid, &s;he was a&s;toni&s;hed that her hu&s;band gave her one of his mi&s;tre&s;&s;es for her companion; at the &s;ame time menaced, that if this ar|rangement continued, &s;he &s;hould be provok|ed to &s;ue for a &s;eparation.</P>
<P>Lady De M&mdash; a&s;toni&s;hed at this lan|guage, endeavoured to undeceive her moth|er, by particulari&s;ing every thing that had pa&s;&s;ed, and the cautions which her hu&s;band had taken to prevent the lea&s;t mi&s;under|&s;tanding. She went even farther, and told her, that it was Loui&s;a's advice that deter|mined her protector to marry.</P>
<P>Without doubt, my child, for they con|certed together the arrangement which has

<P>Lady De M&mdash; prudently concealed from Loui&s;a this di&s;agreeable &s;cene! but &s;he took the fir&s;t opportunity of communicat|ing it to her hu&s;band. He &s;aw the &s;torm gathering; neverthele&s;s, he begged his lady to continue her friend&s;hip to Loui&s;a, adding, that he would get his mother to clear up matters to the Counte&s;s' &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>In this interval, the Counte&s;s plotted the ruin of this innocent creature; and in a|nother conver&s;ation with her daughter, &s;he was mortified to hear her declare, that Lou|i&s;a was a re&s;pectable and amiable character, and that &s;he would obey her hu&s;band's in|junctions in this and in all other circum|&s;tances. The counte&s;s was tran&s;ported with rage, left the room abruptly; and as &s;he had a mini&s;ter among the number of her friends&punc; &s;he obtained an order to take the per&s;on of Loui&s;a, and &s;hut her up in pri&s;on.</P>
<P>This order, ardently &s;olicited, was obtain|ed, and executed the &s;ame day; for before midnight a violent knocking was heard at the door, <HI>de la part du Roi.</HI> The porter ran to inform his ma&s;ter, and to take his orders.

<P>While he was &s;aying this, the mini&s;ter wrote an order for liberating Lady De M. and &s;ent a per&s;on with him to the Madelan|netes, where they arrived at the &s;ame in&s;tant with the Counte&s;s of Lan**, his mother in law, who was informed of Loui&s;a's captiv|ity.

<P>But, my child, it is indecent to retain a|bout your per&s;on the mi&s;tre&s;s of your hu&s;|band.</P>
<P>She is not his mi&s;tre&s;s, madam; on the contrary, &s;he is a virtuous and de&s;erving young creature, that has gained upon my heart by a thou&s;and good and amiable qual|ities, and I love her with the &s;ame cordiali|ty as if &s;he were my &s;i&s;ter.</P>

mother, thought it prudent that Loui&s;a &s;hould remain in her then ignorance and &s;e|curity. The Counte&s;s &s;till plotted how &s;he might wreck her vengeance, and endeavour|ed to get her carried off by a &s;et of villains. But by the watchful and cautious proceed|ings of her &s;on in law, &s;he was baffled in her &s;cheme. This repeated di&s;appointment ren|dered her furious; and finding any act of violence impracticable, had recour&s;e to that mea&s;ure, by which the execrable <HI>De Brin&s;il|liers</HI> terminated the days of her own father. She feigned to be more and more reconcil|ed; &s;he vi&s;ited her daughter, and made the kinde&s;t enquiries after the object of her im|placable hatred. This apparent alteration in the Counte&s;s, induced them to take back Loui&s;a; and in the cour&s;e of her vi&s;its, &s;he &s;hewed her every ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">k of attention. At la&s;t &s;he invited her to pa&s;s a few days at her &s;eat, but neither Mr. De M. nor his lady were dupes to this exce&s;s of civility.

Lady De M. was for Lou|i&s;a's feigning an indi&s;po&s;ition: but as &s;he &s;eemed de&s;irous of accompanying them her wi&s;hes in this re&s;pect were gratified. On their arrival, Loui&s;a was received with a thou&s;and care&s;&s;es; while Lady De M. who
<PB N="59" REF="033533_0057_0FF77B24C27DA260">
knew her mother's vindictive temper, was fearful of &s;ome &s;tratagem. She therefore cautioned Loui&s;a to eat nothing at table but what &s;he helped her to, which &s;he would do in a manner as to give no offence; tell|ing her, that &s;he &s;hould know her rea&s;on at their return: and that if &s;he did not &s;cru|pulou&s;ly attend to it, &s;he would never for|give her. The Counte&s;s, during the fir&s;t &s;ervice, did not apparently remark this at|tention in her daughter; but when the de|&s;ert was brought in &s;he pre&s;ented Loui&s;a with a fine peach, who was going to divide it with Lady De M. but &s;he oppo&s;ed it, giving at the &s;ame time another to her daughter. Loui&s;a in this moment, had for|gotten the caution given her by her friend, and was going to eat the peach that was be|fore her. Lady De M laughing, &s;natched it up, and gave her own in exchange. The vi&s;ible alteration in the Counte&s;s &s;truck Mr. De M. who, trembling le&s;t his wife &s;hould eat this peach, took it up, and per|ceived it had been &s;eparated into two parts: This di&s;covery augmented his &s;u&s;picions, and by a &s;eeming aukwardne&s;s let it fall un|der the table. The Counte&s;s began to re|cover from her alarm, and the dinner ended without any farther accident. Coffee was &s;erved up, when the Counte&s;s contrived that a particular di&s;h &s;hould be pre&s;ented to her

new vi&s;itor; but Lady De M. continuing the plea&s;ant<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y of helping her friend, let the cup of coffee &s;lide off the waiter. This &s;econd attempt being fru&s;trated, the Coun|te&s;s could &s;carce conceal the emotions of her &s;oul. In the interval, a favourite lap dog was lapping up the &s;pilled coffee. Mr. De M. was the only per&s;on who had re|marked this circum&s;tance, and immediately after the dog was &s;eized with convul&s;ions. The Counte&s;s withdrew to her appartment terrified; Lady De M. fell into a fit.&mdash;Her hu&s;band, alarmed, gave immediate orders for their return; when he found the fright had made &s;uch an impre&s;&s;ion on her &s;pirits, that &s;he was &s;oon after delivered, and be|came the victim of her guilty mother.</P>
<P>The di&s;tracted hu&s;band flew to the mini&s;|ter, and expo&s;ed the abominable proceed|ings of his mother in law; who, &s;tung with &s;hame, remor&s;e and contrition, put an end to her exi&s;tence, by the fame guilty means &s;he had admini&s;tered to others.</P>
<P>For two years Loui&s;a, as well as Mr. De M. was a prey to the blacke&s;t melancholy. The grief which the former had &s;hewn on every occa&s;ion, made &s;o lively an impre&s;&s;ion on the heart of Mr. De M. that he thought it his duty to recal her to life and exi&s;tence.</P>

<HEAD>AMELIA: OR, THE FAITHLESS BRITON.</HEAD>
<P>THE revolutions of government and the &s;ubver&s;ions of empire which have &s;welled the theme of national hi&s;torians&punc; have, likewi&s;e, in every age, furni&s;hed an|ecdote to the biographer, and incident to the noveli&s;t.

<P>Thus, the great events of the late war which produced the &s;eperation of the Brit|i&s;h empire, and e&s;tabli&s;hed the &s;overeignty of America, were chequered with &s;cenes of private &s;orrow, and the &s;ucce&s;s of the con|tending forces was alternately fatal to the peace and order of dome&s;tick life.

<P>HORATIO BLYFIELD was a re&s;pectable inhabitant of the &s;tate of Newyork. Suc|ce&s;s had rewarded his indu&s;try in trade with an ample fortune; and his mind, un|contaminated by envy and ambition, freely indulged it&s;elf in the delicious enjoyments of the father and the friend. In the form|er character he &s;uperintended the education of a &s;on and a daughter, left to his &s;ole care by the death of their excellent mother; and in the latter, his benevolence and coun&s;el were uniformily exerci&s;ed for the relief of the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, and information of the illit|erate.</P>
<P>His mercantile intercour&s;e with Great-britan afforded an early opportunity of ob|&s;erving the di&s;po&s;ition of that kingdom with re&s;pect to her colonies; and his knowledge of the habits, tempers, and opinions of the American citizens, furni&s;hed him with a painful anticipation of anarchy and war.&mdash; The texture of his mind, indeed, was nat|urally calm and pa&s;&s;ive, and the ordinary
<PB N="65" REF="033533_0063_0FF77B3368D7B428">
effects of a life of &s;ixty years duration, had totally eradicated all tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ions which rou&s;e men to oppo&s;ition, and qualify them for enterprize. When, therefore, the guant|let was thrown upon the theatre of the new world, and the &s;pirit of di&s;cord began to rage, Horatio, like the Roman Atticus, withdrew from publick clamour, to a &s;e|que&s;tered cottage, in the interiour di&s;trict of Longi&s;tand; and, con&s;ecrating the youth|ful ardour of&punc; his &s;on, Honorious, to the &s;ervice of his country, the fair Amelia was the only companion of his retreat.</P>
<P>Amelia had then attained her &s;eventeenth year. The delicacy of her form was in uni&s;on with the mildne&s;s of her a&s;pect, and the ex|qui&s;ite harmony of her &s;oul, was re&s;pon&s;ive to the &s;ymmetry of her per&s;on. The pride of parental attachment had graced her with every accompli&s;hment that depends upon tuition; and it was the &s;ingular fortune of Amelia, to be at once the admiration of our &s;ex, and the favourite of her own. From &s;uch a daughter, Horatio could not but re|ceive every &s;olace of which his generous feelings were &s;u&s;ceptible in a &s;ea&s;on of na|tional calamity; but the din of arms that frequently interrupted the &s;ilence of the neighbouring fore&s;ts, and the di&s;a&s;trous in|telligence which his &s;on occa&s;ionally tran&s;|mitted from the &s;tandard of the union, &s;u|per&s;eded

the cheerful avocations of the day, and di&s;pelled the peaceful &s;lumbers of the night.</P>
<P>After a retirement of many months, on a morning fatal to the happine&s;s of Horatio's family, the &s;ound of artillery announced a battle, and the hor&s;emen who were ob&s;erved galloping acro&s;s the grounds, proved that the &s;cene of action could not be remote.</P>
<P>As &s;oon, therefore, as the tumult of ho&s;|tility had &s;ub&s;ided, Horatio advanced with his dome&s;ticks, to admini&s;ter comfort and a&s;&s;i&s;tance to the wounded, and to provide a decent interment for the mangled victims of the conflict. In traver&s;ing the deadly field, he perceived an officer, who&s;e exhau&s;ted &s;trength ju&s;t &s;erved for the articulation of a groan, and his attention was immediately directed to the pre&s;ervation of this intere&s;t|ing object, who alone, of the number that had fallen, yielded a hope that his compa&s;|&s;ionate exertions might be crowned with &s;ucce&s;s.

never before &s;een the &s;emblance of death, which therefore afflicted her with all the terrors of imagination; and, notwith&s;tand|ing the pallid countenance of the wounded gue&s;t, he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed an elegance of per&s;on, which, according to the natural operations of female &s;en&s;ibility, added &s;omething, per|haps, to her commi&s;eration of his misfor|tunes. When, however, the&s;e fir&s;t impre&s;|&s;ions had pa&s;&s;ed away, the tenderne&s;s of her nature expre&s;&s;ed it&s;elf in the mo&s;t a&s;&s;iduous actions for his ea&s;e and accommodation, and the encrea&s;ing &s;ymptoms of his recovery, filled her mind with joy and exultation.</P>
<P>The day &s;ucceeding that on which he was introduced to the family of Horatio, his &s;ervant, who had made an ineffectual &s;earch for his body among the &s;lain, arrived at the cottage, and di&s;covered him to be <HI>Doli&s;cus,</HI> the only &s;on and heir of a noble family in England.</P>
<P>When Doli&s;cus had recovered from the &s;en&s;ele&s;s &s;tate to which he had been reduced (chiefly, indeed, by the great effu&s;ion of blood) the fir&s;t exerci&s;e of his faculties was the acknowledgment of obligation, and the profe&s;&s;ion of gratitude. To Horatio he &s;poke in terms of reverence and re&s;pect; and to Amelia in the more animated language of admiration, which melted at length, into the gentle tone of flattery and love. But
<PB N="68" REF="033533_0066_0FF77B3BD538DC80">
Doli&s;cus had been reared in the &s;chool of di&s;&s;ipation: and, with all the qualifications which allure and captivate the female heart, he had learned to con&s;ider virtue only as an ob&s;tacle to plea&s;ure, and beauty merely a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> an incentive to the gratification of pa&s;&s;ion. His experience &s;oon enabled him to di&s;cover &s;omething in the &s;olicitude of the artle&s;s Amelia beyond the dictates of compa&s;&s;ion and ho&s;pitality; and, even before his wounds were clo&s;ed, he conceived the in|famous project of violating the purity and tranquillity of a family, to which he was indebted for the prolongation of his exi&s;t|ence, and the re&s;toration of his health.&mdash; From that very innocence, however, which betrayed her feelings, while &s;he was her&s;elf ignorant of their &s;ource, he anticipated the extreme&s;t difficulty and danger. To im|prove the evident predilection of her mind into a fixed and ardent attachment, requir|ed not, indeed, a very &s;trenuous di&s;play of his talents and addre&s;s; but the &s;acrifice of her honour (which an in&s;urmountable an|tipathy to matrimonial engagements made nece&s;&s;ary to the accompli&s;hment of his pur|po&s;e) was a ta&s;k that he ju&s;tly fore&s;aw, could be only executed by the dete&s;table agency of perfidy and fraud. With the&s;e views then he readily accepted the &s;olicitations of his un&s;u&s;pecting ho&s;t, and even contrived

con&s;equences upon Horatio's peace, her own character, and the fate of the innocent being which &s;he bore, and, wiping the u&s;e|le&s;s tears from her cheek, &s;he re&s;olved publickly to vindicate her honour, and a&s;&s;ert her rights. Animated then, with the im|portant purpo&s;e, &s;upported by the pre&s;ump|tion of her marriage, and hoping yet to find Doli&s;cus in Newyork, &s;he immediately re|paired to that city&mdash;but, alas! he was gone! This di&s;appointment, however, did not de|feat, nor could any ob&s;tacle retard the pro&s;e|cution of her de&s;ign: A &s;hip that &s;ailed the &s;ucceeding day wafted her to Britain, friendle&s;s and forlorn.</P>
<P>Innumerable&punc; difficulties and inconven|iences were encountered by the inexperienc|ed traveller, but they vani&s;hed before the object of her pur&s;uit; and even her en|trance into London, that chaos of clamour and di&s;&s;ipation, produced no other &s;en&s;ations than tho&s;e which naturally aro&s;e from her approach to the dwelling of Doli&s;cus.</P>
<P>Amelia recollected that Doli&s;cus had oft|en de&s;cribed the family re&s;idence to be &s;ituated in Gro&s;venor place, and the &s;tage, in which &s;he journeyed, &s;topping in the evening at a publick hou&s;e in Piccadilly, &s;he determined, without delay, to pay him her unexpected and unwelcome vi&s;it. The embarra&s;&s;ed and anxious manner with
<PB N="78" REF="033533_0068_0FF77B4349780AB0">
which &s;he enquired for his hou&s;e, expo&s;ed her to unju&s;t &s;urmi&s;e and &s;en&s;ele&s;s ribaldry; but her grief rendered her incapable of ob|&s;ervation, and her purity was &s;uperiour to in&s;ult.</P>
<P>Doli&s;cus had arrived about a fortnight earlier than Amelia. The title, influence and fortune, which devolved upon him in con&s;equence of his father's death, had &s;welled his youthful vanity to exce&s;s, and &s;upplied him with a numerous retinue of flatterers and dependants. At the moment that he was li&s;tening in ec&s;tacy to that &s;er|vile crew, the victim of his arts, the delud|ed daughter of the man to whom he was indebted for the pre&s;ervation of his life, &s;tood trembling at his door. A gentle rap, after an awful pau&s;e of &s;ome minutes, pro|cured her admi&s;&s;ion. Her memory recog|nized the features of the &s;ervant that open|ed the door; but it was not the valet who had attended Doli&s;cus at the cottage&mdash; &s;he remembered not where or when &s;he had &s;een him.</P>
<P>After con&s;iderable &s;olicitation the por|ter con&s;ented to call Doli&s;cus from his com|pany, and conducted Amelia into an anti|camber to wait his arrival. A roar of laughter &s;ucceeded the delivery of her me&s;|&s;age, and the word <HI>a&s;&s;ignation,</HI> which was repeated on all &s;ides, &s;eemed to renovate the

wit and hilarity of the table. The gay and gallant ho&s;t, inflamed with Champaign, was not di&s;plea&s;ed at the imputation, but ob&s;erv|ed that as a lady was in the ca&s;e, it was un|nece&s;&s;ary to apologize for a &s;hort de&s;ertion of his friends and wine.</P>
<P>At the &s;ight of that lady, however, Do|li&s;cus &s;tarted. Amelia's countenance was pale and h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">gga<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> with fatigue and &s;orrow, her per&s;on was oppre&s;&s;ed with the burthen which &s;he now bore in its la&s;t &s;tage, and her eye, fixed &s;teadfa&s;tly upon him, as he entered the room, be&s;poke the complicated angui&s;h and indignation of her feelings.&mdash; Her a&s;pect &s;o changed, and her appearance &s;o unexpected, added to the terrors of a guil|ty con&s;cience, and, for a moment, Doli&s;cus thought the vi&s;itation &s;upernatural. But Amelia's wrongs having in&s;pired her with courage, &s;he boldly reproached him with his ba&s;ene&s;s and perfidy, and demanded a publick and unequivocal acknowledgment of their marriage. In vain he endeavoured to &s;oothe and divert her from her purpo&s;e, in vain to per&s;uade her to &s;ilence and delay, his arts had lo&s;t their wonted influence, while the re&s;toration of her injured fame and honour ab&s;orbed every faculty of her mind.</P>
<P>At length he a&s;&s;umed a different tone, a more authoritative manner. "Madam," ex|claimed

he, "I am not to be thus duped o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> controled. I have a &s;en&s;e of pity indeed, for your indi&s;cretion, but none for your pa&s;&s;ion: I would alleviate your afflictions, but I will not &s;ubmit to your frenzy."&mdash; "Wretch!" retorted Amelia, "but that I owe &s;omething to a father's peace, I &s;hould de&s;pi&s;e to call thee hu&s;band."&mdash;"<HI>Hu&s;band,</HI>" cried Doli&s;cus, with a &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">er, "Hu&s;band! why truly I remember a rural ma&s;querade, at which an hone&s;t &s;old<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">r, now my humble porter, played the par&s;on, and you the blu&s;hing bride&mdash;but, pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ythee do not talk of hu&s;band."</P>
<P>This di&s;covery only was wanting for the con&s;ummation of Amelia's mi&s;ery. It was &s;udden and fatal as the lightning's bla&s;t&mdash; &s;he &s;unk beneath the &s;troke.
