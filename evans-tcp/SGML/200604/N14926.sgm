<P>AT a meeting of the General A&s;&s;ociation of the State of Connecticut in June la&s;t, it was thought expedient, that a number of the P&s;alms in Doctor Watts's ver&s;ion, which are locally appropriated, &s;hould be altered and applied to the &s;tate of the Chri&s;tian Church in general, and not to any particular coun|try; and finding &s;ome attempts had been made to alter and apply tho&s;e P&s;alms to America, or parti|cular parts of America, tending to de&s;troy that uni|formity in the u&s;e of P&s;almody, &s;o de&s;ireable in reli|gious a&s;&s;emblies; they appointed the Rev. Me&s;&s;rs. <HI>Timothy Pitkin, John Smally</HI> and <HI>Theodore Hin&s;dale,</HI> a Committee to confer with and apply to Mr. <HI>Joel Barlow,</HI> of Hartford, to make the propo&s;ed al|terations. The&s;e, together with the additions and the collection of Hymns annexed to this Edition, we have carefully examined and approved; and we therefore recommend them to the u&s;e of the Church of Chri&s;t, for the purpo&s;es of public wor&s;hip and private devo|tion.</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE rea&s;ons for undertaking the Corrections and Ad|ditions, contained in this Edition of the P&s;alms are &s;ufficiently explained in the foregoing Narrative of the General A&s;&s;ociation's Committee. Yet the difficulty of giving general &s;atisfaction in attempts of this kind, cannot be realized till the experiment be made. Among the many Ver&s;ions which have been given of the&s;e Divine Songs, in order to adapt them to the chri&s;tian State and Wor&s;hip, that of <HI>DOCTOR WATTS</HI> is un|doubtedly in many re&s;pects to be preferred. His Appli|cation of the prophetic pa&s;&s;ages; his ea&s;y and natural ex|plication of parts that are in any mea&s;ure ob&s;cure; his pure and elevated &s;trains of devotion, &s;o plea&s;ing to every pious and attentive Reader, have perhaps never been equalled in our Language: And with re&s;pect to his &s;tyle and manner of ver&s;ification, they are not only better adapted to the capacities of common, a&s;&s;emblies and the ea&s;y &s;olemnity of church mu&s;ic, than any other that have yet appeared; but it may be pre&s;umed that no Poet after him will &s;ucceed in compo&s;ing devotional &s;ongs, without taking his model of &s;tyle and ver&s;ification from Doctor Watts. Were it not for his local appropriati|on of &s;ome P&s;alms, and his omi&s;&s;ion of a few others, his Ver&s;ion would doubtle&s;s have been u&s;ed for many ages without an amendment. But as the author of the&s;e corrections is employed, directed and &s;upported by &s;o re|&s;pectable a Body as the whole Clergy of the State; and as it is an object of great importance that harmony and uniformity &s;hould be e&s;tabli&s;hed as exten&s;ively as po&s;&s;i|ble in the u&s;e of P&s;almody, he has not only avoided all local applications, but has made &s;ome &s;lighter correcti|ons in point of elegance, where the rules of grammar, e&s;tabli&s;hed &s;ince the time of Doctor Watts, have made it nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>The P&s;alms con&s;iderably altered are the <HI>21</HI>&s;t, <HI>60</HI>th, <HI>67</HI>th, <HI>75</HI>th, <HI>124</HI>th, <HI>147</HI>th; tho&s;e omitted by Doctor Watts, are the <HI>28</HI>th, <HI>43</HI>d, <HI>52</HI>d, <HI>54</HI>th, <HI>59</HI>th, <HI>64</HI>th, <HI>70</HI>th, <HI>79</HI>th, <HI>88</HI>th, <HI>108</HI>th, <HI>137</HI>th, <HI>140</HI>th.</P>
<P>The Hymns are &s;elected chiefly from Doctor Watts;
<PB REF="018931_0004_0FA90E20A57C8EC0">
&s;ome are entirely new. It was thought advi&s;eable to bind them in the &s;ame volume, that &s;acramental and other particular occa&s;ions, not provided for in the Book of P&s;alms, might be &s;upplied with &s;uitable &s;ongs of de|votion.</P>
