<HEAD>A DISCOURSE ON THE <HI>DICOVERY</HI> OF <HI>AMERICA.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WE are met together, this day, my re&s;pectable auditors, to commemorate an event; which, whether it be con&s;idered in its cau&s;es, in its execution, or in its con&s;equences, mu&s;t be acknowledged, a &s;plendid in&s;tance of the accompli&s;hment of that remarkable predic|tion of the prophet,
<Q><BIBL><HI>DANIEL, Chap. xii. ver. 4.</HI></BIBL>
<P>"Many &s;hall run to and fro and knowledge &s;hall be increa&s;ed."</P></Q></P>
<P>The&s;e words in their obvious and literal meaning point out a va&s;t increa&s;e of &s;cience, and the &s;ub&s;erviency of travelling to this im|portant purpo&s;e. The time to which they refer cannot be preci&s;ely defined; but it mu&s;t
<PB N="6" REF="024085_0005_0FC31C6454F6BEB8">
be con&s;idered as remote from that in which they were delivered; and, it is evidently con|nected with the appearance of that glorious per&s;on "Michael the Prince," who&s;e coming and kingdom, and the &s;alvation of which he is the author are foretold in the &s;ame proph|ecy.</P>
<P>A thought of this kind would not readily have occurred to the mind of a captive Jew, had he not been under the influence of the prophetic &s;pirit. Tran&s;ported by the fortune of war into the dominions of a foreign Prince, as was Daniel, his highe&s;t expectation would be to return to the land of his nativity and re&s;ume his former employments and mode of acquiring knowledge; the objects of which were, the antiquities of the world, the doc|trine of the divine unity, the &s;eries of prophe|cy, the ritual wor&s;hip and the &s;y&s;tem of moral duty, which were taught in the &s;acred books. The hope of &s;uch a return, grounded on a divine promi&s;e was one &s;ource of con&s;olation to the Jews in their captivity; but this proph|et was favoured with &s;uch divine communica|tions re&s;pecting the future fortunes of his na|tion and the &s;tate of the Church of God un|der the reign of the Me&s;&s;iah, as carried his
<PB N="7" REF="024085_0006_0FC31C65E925B8D0">
views into the mo&s;t di&s;tant ages, and pre&s;ent|ed &s;cenes and events, of a nature very differ|ent from the genius and character of the times in which he lived. Among the&s;e, the increa&s;e of &s;cience, as it is connected with travelling, is not the lea&s;t con&s;picuous. Though brief|ly mentioned, yet it is placed among the mo&s;t important facts, and is repre&s;ented as one of the happy events attending the reign of the Prince Me&s;&s;iah, of the increa&s;e of who&s;e gov|ernment and peace there &s;hall be no end.</P>
<P>Sub&s;equent ages and tran&s;actions have proved that this prediction was founded in truth. Time has unfolded what was fore&s;een in prophetic vi&s;ion; and the hand of divine Providence has &s;pread before our eyes, tho&s;e great events, which many prophets and wi&s;e men de&s;ired to &s;ee, but &s;aw them not.</P>
<P>As "the te&s;timony of Je&s;us is the &s;pirit of prophecy," &s;o we may very properly con&s;ider the travels of the Apo&s;tles to &s;pread the knowl|edge of the go&s;pel, as one capital in&s;tance of the fulfilment of Daniel's prediction. By virtue of the commi&s;&s;ion which they received from their Lord, and the &s;pecial powers with which they were ve&s;ted, particularly the gift of tongues, tho&s;e cho&s;en witne&s;&s;es carried the
<PB N="8" REF="024085_0007_0FC31C7689B7A008">
knowledge of the truth to all parts of the world, then known; &s;o that it might be &s;aid of them, as of the luminaries of heaven, "their found went into all the earth and their words to the end of the world; there was no &s;peech nor language where their voice was not heard." The effects of that evangelic mi&s;|&s;ion, though in &s;ome places tran&s;ient, yet in others were abiding. Though a corrupt form of chri&s;tianity over&s;pread many of the na|tions who had heard the glad tidings of &s;al|vation; yet &s;o much of the truth remained, as to be a foundation for reviving the pure doctrines and practices of the apo&s;tolic age, when a concurrence of circum&s;tances pre&s;ent|ed a favourable opportunity.</P>
<P>Be&s;ide the miraculous &s;preading of divine truth by the labours and travels of the Apo&s;|tles, there was no remarkable event, which might be called another in&s;tance of the ac|compli&s;hment of the prophecy of Daniel, till &s;everal centuries had elap&s;ed. Other cau&s;es then contributed to produce events, which, either in their nature or con&s;equences, proved beneficial to the intere&s;t of &s;cience. Even the &s;uper&s;tition which prompted the cru&s;ades, in the tenth and eleventh centuries,
<PB N="9" REF="024085_0008_0FC31C7F4798E2A0">
opened a communication between the mo&s;t di&s;tant countries of Europe and A&s;ia; and the adventurers, who returned from the holy land, brought home a ta&s;te for the manners, habits and productions of the ea&s;t, which proved favourable to the &s;pirit of commerce; the mo&s;t powerful of all cau&s;es which have contributed to enlarge the &s;phere of &s;cience; becau&s;e it is &s;timulated by one of the mo&s;t active principles of the human mind.</P>
<P>But even the operations of commerce were &s;low and languid, till the di&s;covery of the magnetic needle, in the beginning of the fourteenth century. Before that period, the cautious mariner followed the indentings of the &s;hore, and con&s;umed much time in creep|ing along from Cape to Cape; &s;eeking a port before every tempe&s;t, and drawing up his bark to land during the reign of winter, or of ad|ver&s;e winds. But when the polarity of the magnet became known, he ventured farther into the ocean, and began to a&s;&s;ume that do|minion over the &s;ea, for which man had a grant from his Creator, when he was original|ly formed in the divine image. Then the deep rooted errors of antiquity were gradual|ly
<PB N="10" REF="024085_0009_0FC31C8047A80988">
corrected: The torrid and frigid zones were found to be habitable. The dream of Scipio proved to be an illu&s;ion: Thul&eacute; was no longer the la&s;t of lands, nor the pillars of Hercules the boundary of the univer&s;e.</P>
<P>About the middle of the fifteenth century, when the Portugue&s;e under the conduct of Prince Henry, and afterward of King John II. were pu&s;hing their di&s;coveries along the we&s;tern &s;hore of Africa, to find a pa&s;&s;age by the &s;outh to India; a genius aro&s;e, who&s;e memory has been pre&s;erved with veneration in the pages of hi&s;tory, as the in&s;trument of enlarging the region of &s;cience and commerce, beyond any of his predece&s;&s;ors. CHRIST|OPHER COLUMBUS, a native of the Republic of Genoa, was born in tbe year 1447, and at the age of fourteen entered on a &s;eafaring life, as the proper &s;phere, in which his vigorous mind was de&s;tined to perform ex|ploits which &s;hould a&s;toni&s;h mankind.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Life of Columbus by his &s;on Ferdinand&mdash; Chap. 4. See Vol. II. of Churchill's Collection of Voyages.</NOTE> He was educated in the &s;ciences of Geometry and A&s;tronomy, which form the ba&s;is of nav|igation;
<PB N="11" REF="024085_0010_0FC31C819C073390">
and he was well ver&s;ed in Co&s;mo|graphy, Hi&s;tory and Philo&s;ophy. His active and enterpri&s;ing genius, though it enabled him to comprehend the old &s;y&s;tems, yet would not &s;uffer him to re&s;t in their deci&s;ions, how|ever &s;anctified by time or by venerable names; but, determined to examine them by actual experiment, he fir&s;t vi&s;ited the &s;eas within the polar circle, and afterward tho&s;e parts of Af|rica, which the Portugue&s;e had di&s;covered, as far as the coa&s;t of Guinea; and by the time that he had attained the age of thirty-&s;even, he had from his own experience received the fulle&s;t conviction, that the opinion of the an|cients re&s;pecting the torrid and frigid zones was void of any ju&s;t foundation.</P>
<P>When an old &s;y&s;tem is found erroneous in one point, it is natural to &s;u&s;pect it of farther imperfections; and when one difficulty is o|vercome, others appear le&s;s formidable. Such was the ca&s;e with Columbus; and his views were accelerated by an incident, which threat|ened to put an end to his life. During one of his voyages, the &s;hip in which he &s;ailed took fire in an engagement with a Venetian galley, and the crew were obliged to leap in|to
<PB N="12" REF="024085_0011_0FC31C83266E8BF8">
the &s;ea, to avoid peri&s;hing in the flames. In this extremity, Columbus by the help of a floating oar &s;wam upwards of two leagues, to the coa&s;t of Portugal near Li&s;bon, and met with a welcome reception from many of his countrymen who were &s;ettled there.</P>
<P>At Li&s;bon, he married the daughter of Pere&s;trello, an old &s;eaman, who had been concerned in the di&s;covery of Porto Santo and Madeira; from who&s;e journals and charts, he received the highe&s;t entertainment. Pur|&s;uing his inquiries in Geography, and ob&s;erv|ing what &s;low progre&s;s the Portugue&s;e made in their attempts to find a way round Africa to India, "he began to reflect that as the Portugue&s;e travelled &s;o far &s;outhward, it were no le&s;s proper to &s;ail we&s;tward,"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Life, Chap. V.</NOTE> and that it was rea&s;onable to expect to find the de&s;ired land in that direction.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t here be remembered, that India was in part known to the ancients, and that its rich and u&s;eful productions had for many centuries been conveyed into Europe, either by Caravans through the de&s;arts of Syria and Arabia; or by the way of the Red Sea, through
<PB N="13" REF="024085_0012_0FC31C8E69E5E038">
Egypt, into the Mediterranean.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Robert&s;on's India. Bruce's Travels.</NOTE> This lu|crative commerce had been &s;ucce&s;&s;ively en|gro&s;&s;ed by the Phen<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">cians, the Hebrews, the Egyptians, the A&s;&s;yrians, the Palmyrenes, the Arabians, the Genoe&s;e and the Venetians. The Portugue&s;e were then &s;eeking it by at|tempting the circumnavigation of Africa; and their expectation of finding it in that direc|tion was grounded on ancient hi&s;torical tra|ditions, that a voyage had been formerly made by the orders of Necho King of Egypt, from the Red Sea, round the &s;outhern part of Africa to the &s;traights of Hercules; and that the &s;ame route had been traver&s;ed by Hanno the Carthaginian, by Eudoxus the Egyptian and others. The Portugue&s;e had <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">n&s;umed about half a century in making va|rious attempts, and had advanced no farther, on the we&s;tern Coa&s;t of Africa, than ju&s;t to cro&s;s the Equator, when Columbus conceiv|ed his great de&s;ign of finding India in the we&s;t.</P>
<P>The cau&s;es which led him to entertain this idea are di&s;tingui&s;hed by his &s;on, the writer of his life into the&s;e three,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Life, Chap. VI.</NOTE> "natural
<PB N="14" REF="024085_0013_0FC31C8FDB146750">
rea&s;on, the authority of writers, and the te&s;ti|mony of &s;ailors."</P>
<P>By the help of "rea&s;on," he argued in this manner, That the earth and &s;ea compo&s;ed one globe or &s;phere. This was known by ob&s;erving the &s;hadow of the earth in lunar eclip&s;es. Hence he concluded that it might be travelled over from ea&s;t to we&s;t or from we&s;t to ea&s;t. It had been explored to the the ea&s;t by &s;ome European travellers as far as Cipango or Japan, and as far we&s;tward as the Azores or We&s;tern I&s;lands. The re|maining &s;pace though now known to be more than half, he &s;uppo&s;ed to be but one third part of the circumference of the globe. If this &s;pace, were an open &s;ea, he imagined it might be ea&s;ily &s;ailed over; and if there were any land extending ea&s;twardly beyond the known limits of A&s;ia, he &s;uppo&s;ed that it mu&s;t be nearer to Spain by the we&s;t than by the ea&s;t. For it was then a received opinion that the continent and i&s;lands of India ex|tended over one third part of the circumfer|ence of the globe; that another third part was comprehended between India and the we&s;tern &s;hore of Spain; therefore it was con|cluded, that the ea&s;tern part of India mu&s;t be
<PB N="15" REF="024085_0014_0FC31C96F3E25170">
as near to Spain as the we&s;tern part. This opinion though now known to be erroneous, yet being then admitted as true, made it ap|pear to Columbus very ea&s;y and practicable to di&s;cover India in the we&s;t. He hoped al|&s;o that between Spain and India, in that di|rection, there might be found &s;ome i&s;lands; by the help of which, as re&s;ting places in his voyage, he might the better pur&s;ue his main de&s;ign. The probability of the exi&s;tence of land in that Ocean, he argued, partly from the opinion of philo&s;ophers, that there was more land than &s;ea on the &s;urface of the globe; and partly from the nece&s;&s;ity of a counterpoi&s;e in the we&s;t, for the immen&s;e quantity of land which was known to be in the ea&s;t.</P>
<P>Another &s;ource from which he drew his conclu&s;ion, was "the authority of learned men," who had affirmed the po&s;&s;ibility of &s;ail|ing from the we&s;tern coa&s;t of Spain, to the ea&s;tern bounds of India. Some of the an|cient Geographers had admitted this for truth, and one of them<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pliny.</NOTE> had affirmed that forty days were &s;ufficient to perform this nav|igation. The&s;e authorities fell in with the
<PB N="16" REF="024085_0015_0FC31C981DACB9B8">
theory which Columbus had formed; and having as early as 1474, communicated his ideas in writing to Paul, a learned Phy&s;ician of Florence, he received from him letters of that date, confirming his opinion and encour|aging his de&s;ign; accompanied with a chart, in which Paul had laid down the city of Qui&s;ay (&s;uppo&s;ed to be the capital of China) but little more than two thou&s;and leagues we&s;tward from Li&s;bon, which in fact is but half the di&s;tance. Thus by arguing from true principles, and by indulging conjectures partly well founded and partly erroneous, Columbus was led to the execution of a plan, bold in its conception, and to his view ea&s;ily practicable; for great minds overlook inter|mediate ob&s;tacles, which men of &s;maller views magnify into in&s;uperable difficulties.</P>
<P>The third ground on which he formed his idea was "the te&s;timony of mariners;" a cla&s;s of men who at that time, and in that imper|fect &s;tate of &s;cience, were too prone to mix fable with fact; and were often mi&s;led by ap|pearances, which they could not &s;olve. In the &s;ea, between Madeira and the We&s;tern I&s;lands, pieces of carved wood and large joints of cane had been di&s;covered, which were &s;up|po&s;ed
<PB N="17" REF="024085_0016_0FC31C9992791870">
to be brought by we&s;terly winds. Branches of pine trees, a canoe, and two hu|man bodies of a complexion different from the Europeans and Africans had been found, on the &s;hores of the&s;e i&s;lands. Some na|vigators had affirmed, that they had &s;een i&s;lands not more than an hundred leagues we&s;tward from the Azores. There was a tradition, that when Spain was conquered by the Moors in the eighth century, &s;even Bi&s;h|ops who were exiled from their country, had built &s;even cities and churches, on an i&s;land cal|led Antilla; which was &s;uppo&s;ed to be not more than two hundred leagues we&s;t of the Canaries; and it was &s;aid that a Portugue&s;e &s;hip had once di&s;covered this i&s;land, but could never find it again. The&s;e &s;tories, partly true and partly fabulous, had their effect on the mind of Columbus. He believed that i&s;lands were to be found, we&s;tward of the Azores and Canaries, though according to his theory, they were at a greater di&s;tance than any of his contemporaries had imagined. His candour led him to adopt an opinion from Pliny re|&s;pecting floating i&s;lands, by the help of which he accounted for the appearances related to
<PB N="18" REF="024085_0017_0FC31CA44929FE38">
him, by his marine brethren. It is not im|probable that the large i&s;lands of floating ice, driven from the Polar Seas to the &s;outh|ward; or the Fog Banks, which form many &s;ingular appearances re&s;embling land and trees, might have been the true foundation of this opinion and of the&s;e reports.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The following account of a curious deception, extracted from the Gentleman's Magazine, may eluc|idate the above ob&s;ervations.</P>

gave orders to a &s;hip, bound to the i&s;lands of Cape de Verd, to attempt a di&s;covery in the we&s;t, but through ignorance and want of enterpri&s;e, the navigators, after wandering for &s;ome time in the ocean and making no di&s;covery, reached their de&s;tined port and turned the project of Columbus into ridicule.</P>

wi&s;e men and &s;kilful &s;ailors who had exi&s;ted &s;ince the creation? Another was the author|ity of Seneca who had doubted whether it were po&s;&s;ible to navigate the ocean at any great di&s;tance from the &s;hore; but admitting that it were navigable, they imagined, that three years would be required to perform the voyage, which Columbus propo&s;ed. A third was, that if a &s;hip &s;hould &s;ail we&s;tward on a round globe, &s;he would nece&s;&s;arily go down, on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide, and then it would be impo&s;&s;ible to return, becau&s;e it would be like climbing up a hill, which no &s;hip could do with the &s;tronge&s;t wind. A fourth ob|jection was grounded on a book of St. Au|gu&s;tine, in which he had expre&s;&s;ed his doubt of the exi&s;tence of antipodes and the po&s;&s;ibil|ity of going from one hemi&s;phere to the oth|er. As the writings of this Holy Father had received the &s;anction of the Church, to con|tradict him was deemed here&s;y.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Life of Columbus, Chap. XII.</NOTE></P>
<P>For &s;uch rea&s;ons, and by &s;uch rea&s;oners the propo&s;al of Columbus was at fir&s;t rejected; but by the influence of father Perez, a Span|i&s;h Prie&s;t, and Lewis Santangel, an officer of

Thus, to the generous deci&s;ion of a female mind, we owe the di&s;covery of America.</P>
<P>The nece&s;&s;ary preparations being made, and a year's provi&s;ion laid in, on the 3d of Augu&s;t, 1492, Columbus &s;ailed from Palos, a port of Spain, on the Mediterranean, with three ve&s;&s;els, one of which was called a Car|rack, and the other two, Caravels; having on board, the whole, ninety men. Having pa&s;&s;ed through the &s;traights of Gibraltar, he arrived at the Canaries, on the 12th of the &s;ame month; where he was detained in refit|ting one of the Caravels, and taking in wood and water, till the 6th of September, when he &s;ailed we&s;tward on his voyage of di&s;covery.</P>
<P>This voyage, which now is con&s;idered as an ea&s;y and plea&s;ant run, between the lati|tudes of 20 and 30 degrees, with a trade wind, was then the bolde&s;t attempt which had ever
<PB N="24" REF="024085_0023_0FC31CBA9799A428">
been made, and filled the minds of the be&s;t &s;eamen with apprehen&s;ion. They were go|ing directly from home, and from all hope of relief, if any accident &s;hould befal them. No friendly port nor human being was known to be in that direction. Every bird which flew in the air, every fi&s;h which appeared in the &s;ea, and every weed which floated on its &s;ur|face, was regarded with the mo&s;t minute at|tention,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the journal of the voyage in the Life of Co|lumbus, Chap. XVIII&mdash;XXI.</NOTE> as if the fate of the voyage depend|ed on it. A phenomenon which had never before been ob&s;erved &s;truck them with terror. The magnetic needle appeared to vary from the pole: They began to apprehend that their compa&s;s would prove an unfaithful guide; and the trade wind, which wa&s;ted them along with its friendly wings, they fear|ed would ob&s;truct their return.</P>
<P>To be twenty days at &s;ea, without &s;ight of land was what the bolde&s;t mariner had never before attempted. At the expiration of that time the impatient &s;ailors began to talk of throwing their commander into the ocean and returning home. Their murmurs reach|ed
<PB N="25" REF="024085_0024_0FC31CBF46112D48">
his ears; but his active mind was never at a lo&s;s for expedients, even in the greate&s;t ex|tremity. By &s;oothing, flattery and artifice, by inventing rea&s;ons for every uncommon ap|pearance, by promi&s;ing rewards to the obedi|ent, and a gratuity to him who &s;hould fir&s;t di&s;cover land, in addition to what the King had ordered, and by deceiving them in the &s;hip's reckoning, he kept them on their cour&s;e for &s;ixteen days longer. In the night of the 11th of October, he him&s;elf &s;aw a light, which &s;eemed to be on &s;hore, and in the morning of the 12th, they had the joyful &s;ight of land, which proved to be the i&s;land of Guanahana, one of the clu&s;ter called Bahamas, in the 25th degree of north latitude.</P>
<P>Thus in the &s;pace of thirty-&s;ix days, and in the 45th year of his age, Columbus complet|ed a voyage which he had &s;pent twenty years in projecting and executing; a voyage which opened to the Europeans a new world; which gave a new turn to their thoughts, to their &s;pirit of enterpri&s;e and of commerce; which enlarged the empire of Spain, and &s;tamped with immortality the name of Columbus.</P>

During his pa&s;&s;age he met with a violent tempe&s;t which threatened him with de&s;truction. In this extremity he gave an admirable proof of his calmne&s;s and fore&s;ight. He wrote on parchment an ac|count of his di&s;coveries, wrapped it in a piece of oiled cloth, and inclo&s;ed it in a cake of wax, which he put into a tight ca&s;k and threw into the &s;ea.

<P>After this, he made three other voyages to America, in one of which he di&s;covered the continent; and in a &s;ucceeding voyage he endeavoured to find a pa&s;&s;age through it to India, but in vain; that de&s;irable country he never &s;aw.</P>

the probability, and then demon&s;trated the certainty of the exi&s;tence of this continent.</P>
<P>It is remarkable, that a fate &s;imilar to that of Columbus, hath befallen others of the fir&s;t adventurers to America. The great RALEIGH was &s;acrificed to the jealou&s;y of Spain by the pu&s;illanimity of his &s;overeign.

<P>The fir&s;t branch of &s;cience which pre&s;ents it&s;elf in this inquiry is <HI>Geography</HI>; the knowl|edge of which has been mo&s;t e&s;&s;entially im|proved by means of this di&s;covery. It is to
<PB N="29" REF="024085_0028_0FC31CD86EA85DD0">
us very a&s;toni&s;hing, that the ancient phi|lo&s;ophers per&s;i&s;ted &s;o tenaciou&s;ly in their opinion re&s;pecting the five zones; and e&s;pec|ially that they deemed the equatorial regions uninhabitable, when they had the means of better information. For, voyages were fre|quently made from the red &s;ea to the coa&s;t of India, within ten or twelve degrees of the equator. The Carthaginians planted colo|nies on the we&s;tern &s;ide of Africa, within five degrees of it; and if the country of Ophir was the &s;ame with Sofala, on the ea&s;tern &s;hore of Africa, the navy of Solomon mu&s;t have cro&s;&s;ed the equator both in going and return|ing. Notwith&s;tanding this advantage which they certainly had, it was a received opinion among the Greeks and Romans, which no one dared to controvert; that the torrid zone was &s;corched by the vertical &s;un, and that no hu|man being could re&s;ide in it, or pa&s;s through it, from the northern to the &s;outhern hemi&s;phere. This error, it is probable, fir&s;t aro&s;e from the knowledge which they had of the va&s;t, &s;andy de&s;arts of Africa, which had &s;ometimes prov|ed de&s;tructive to whole armies who had at|tempted to pa&s;s them. The only way, in
<PB N="30" REF="024085_0029_0FC31CD96FAEFC48">
which we can account for their not correcting this mi&s;take, is, that the navigation of the &s;outhern &s;eas was performed chiefly by the Phenicians and Carthaginians, who were the enemies and rivals of the Greeks and Romans, and kept their knowledge to them&s;elves. We find among them no philo&s;ophers, and very few authors. They were practical &s;eamen and merchants, intent on gain, and monopo|lizers of commerce.</P>
<P>The Greeks and Romans had very little more of the &s;pirit of enterpri&s;e than was con|nected with their ho&s;tile expeditions; but they formed theories of geography, either by the ob&s;ervations and reports of their military commanders, or by &s;econd hand information, or by conjecture and hypothe&s;is.

geographical knowledge. That imperfect &s;y&s;tem became at length a part of the creed of the Roman church, and was defended by the court of inqui&s;ition. If St. Augu&s;tine doubt|ed the diurnal motion of the earth, or the ex|i&s;tence of antipodes, or the habitablene&s;s of the torrid zone; St. Dominic was ready with his infernal logic, to &s;ilence every one who pre&s;umed to di&s;&s;ent from the infallible chair. Thus ignorance and error were canonized, and the feeble dawn of &s;cience was &s;carcely able to penetrate the dark mi&s;t of the middle ages. Even after the di&s;coveries made by the Portugue&s;e in the ea&s;t, and by the Spaniards in the we&s;t, the Roman Pontiff gravely a&s;|&s;umed a right to divide the world between them by a line drawn from pole to pole, at the di&s;tance of an hundred leagues from the Azores or we&s;tern i&s;lands; without any pro|vi&s;ion, in ca&s;e they &s;hould meet, and their claims &s;hould interfere on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the globe.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the Bull at large in Hazard's Collection, vol.

<P>In like manner, our title to religious free|dom was &s;uppo&s;ed to be derived, partly from the &s;ame charters and commi&s;&s;ions; in which, liberty of con&s;cience was <HI>granted</HI> by the King, to &s;uch of his &s;ubjects as &s;hould &s;ettle in the plantations; partly from acts of toleration, made in England, and con&s;trued to extend to the colonies; and, partly from our own laws made to favour the religious opinions and practices of tho&s;e who di&s;&s;ented from the majority. Religious liberty was not placed on its right foundation, nor deriv|ed from its true &s;ource. The world was not obliged to the &s;tate&s;man or the divine, for the fir&s;t acknowledgment of this darling right; but to the &s;pirit of commerce and to the intere&s;ted views of the merchant.

<P>Too much of the &s;ame &s;pirit, it mu&s;t be con|fe&s;&s;ed, has reigned here. Our ance&s;tors in New England e&s;tabli&s;hed a te&s;t before any was enacted by the Engli&s;h parliament; and though it has, long &s;ince, been abrogat|ed, yet the idea of an exclu&s;ive right to the honours and emoluments of government, by the prevailing religious denomination, con|tinued till very lately. Some of us can re|member the time, when it was thought a &s;uffi|cient objection to a man's being cho&s;en to a &s;eat in the legi&s;lature, that he belonged to the

Epi&s;copal Church. And, even at this enlight|ened period, I blu&s;h to own, that, by the Con&s;titution of this Commonwealth, the Jew, the Mahometan, the Gentoo, and the Di&s;ci|ple of Confucius, are excluded from our pub|lic councils, be they ever &s;o good citizens; whil&s;t men, who for convenience, call them|&s;elves Chri&s;tians, though deeply tinged with infidelity, and de&s;titute of moral principles, <HI>may</HI> freely be admitted.</P>
<P>But though imperfection is more or le&s;s interwoven with all human con&s;titutions; yet a &s;pirit of improvement is evidently pervad|ing this country. Several of the fir&s;t forms of government which were made for the&s;e States, have been reviewed and amended. Re|ligious te&s;ts have been gradually aboli&s;hed; and our national form of government is en|tirely free from them. It leaves religion where all civil government ought to leave it; to the con&s;ciences of individuals, under the control of the &s;upreme Lord.</P>
<P>As learning is acknowledged to be e&s;&s;en|tially nece&s;&s;ary to the pre&s;ervation of a repub|lican government, &s;o wherever the true &s;pirit of liberty reigns it will cheri&s;h the intere&s;t

of &s;cience. This principle was well under|&s;tood by the fathers of New England, and we their po&s;terity have reaped the benefit of their wi&s;e and faithful care to provide the means of in&s;truction for us. The &s;ame &s;pirit &s;eems more and more to prevail throughout this country, and forms one of the mo&s;t hap|py omens of the pre&s;ervation of liberty to future generations.</P>
<P>From our example of a government found|ed on the principle of repre&s;entation, exclud|ing all family preten&s;ions and titles of nobil|ity, other nations are beginning to look into their natural and original rights as <HI>men</HI>; and to a&s;&s;ert and maintain them again&s;t the claims of de&s;poti&s;m. As far as the pre&s;ent &s;truggle in Europe again&s;t civil and &s;piritual u&s;urpa|tion, is conducted on virtuous principles, we cordially wi&s;h it &s;ucce&s;s. But have we not rea&s;on to fear that the cau&s;e of liberty may be injured by the intemperate zeal of its friends, as much as by the &s;y&s;tematic oppo&s;i|tion of its enemies? If wi&s;dom, harmony and fortitude were combined with patrioti&s;m on the &s;ide of liberty, we might hope that the time was approaching, when an hereditary right to govern a nation would appear as con|temptible

as the royal touch for the King's evil; and when the loftie&s;t prelates of Europe would find them&s;elves reduced to the &s;ame level with the curate of a pari&s;h. But what &s;cenes of anarchy and di&s;tre&s;s may take place before the&s;e de&s;irable events, we mu&s;t wait for time to unfold.</P>
<P>It is an old ob&s;ervation of Solomon, "He that increa&s;eth knowledge increa&s;eth &s;orrow." This may ju&s;tly be applied to the enlarge|ment of &s;cience which is made by the di&s;cov|ery of America. The field is extended, but difficulties have ari&s;en which are not yet &s;olv|ed. Though we have learned more of the works of creation and providence than was known to preceding ages, yet we find that there is &s;till more behind the curtain.</P>
<P>Among the&s;e difficulties we may reckon the que&s;tion, <HI>whence was America peopled?</HI> For three centuries this has been a &s;ubject of de|bate among the learned; and it is amu&s;ing, to &s;ee how national prejudice has become in|volved with philo&s;ophical di&s;qui&s;ition, in the attempts which have been made to &s;olve the que&s;tion. The claims of Hanno the Car|thaginian, of Madoc the Welchman, of the

&s;even Bi&s;hops of Spain, and the ten tribes of I&s;rael, have had their &s;everal advocates; and after all, the claim of the &s;ix nations is as well founded as any, that their ance&s;tors &s;prung like trees out of the &s;oil. The true philo&s;o|pher will treat them all with indifference, and will &s;u&s;pend his judgment till he has better information than any which has yet appear|ed. Since the late di&s;covery of many clu&s;|ters of i&s;lands in the Pacific Ocean, and the near approach of the A&s;ian to the American continent, the difficulty with re&s;pect to the population of America, by the human &s;pecies is le&s;&s;ened; and had this continent been di&s;|covered by a &s;cientific people on its we&s;tern, before it was on its ea&s;tern &s;ide, perhaps the que&s;tion would not have been &s;o long nor &s;o warmly agitated. But &s;till the tran&s;porta|tion of other animals from the old to the new continent, and the exi&s;tence of &s;ome here which are not known there, is a &s;ubject, which remains involved in ob&s;curity.</P>
<P>Before we have &s;olved one difficulty anoth|er ri&s;es to view. It is not many years &s;ince the large bones found in the neighbourhood of the Ohio excited much attention. We
<PB N="45" REF="024085_0044_0FC31D2C0CF87328">
had &s;carcely conjectured to what animal they belonged when a new object was brought for|ward. <HI>Mounds</HI> and <HI>fortifications</HI> of a regular con&s;truction were di&s;covered in the thicke&s;t &s;hades of the American fore&s;t, overgrown with trees of immen&s;e age, which are &s;uppo&s;|ed to be not the fir&s;t growth upon the &s;pot &s;ince the dereliction of its ancient po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t obvious mode of &s;olving the dif|ficulty which aro&s;e in the curious mind on this occa&s;ion was by making inquiry of the natives. But the &s;tructures are too ancient for their tradition, their olde&s;t and wi&s;e&s;t men know nothing of their original. Indeed the form and materials of the&s;e works &s;eem to indicate the exi&s;tence of a race of men in a &s;tage of improvement &s;uperior to tho&s;e natives of whom we or our fathers have had any knowledge; who had different ideas of con|venience and utility; who were more patient of labour, and better acquainted with the art of defence.</P>
<P>That the&s;e works were not con&s;tructed by any Europeans who have penetrated the A|merican wilderne&s;s &s;ince the di&s;covery of the continent, appears from various con&s;idera|tions;
<PB N="46" REF="024085_0045_0FC31D2E122A3138">

At what remote period the&s;e works were erected and by whom; what became of their builders: whether they were driven away or de&s;troyed by a more fierce and &s;avage people, the Goths and Vandals of America; or whether they voluntarily mi|grated to a di&s;tant region; and where that region is, are que&s;tions which at pre&s;ent can not be &s;atisfactorily an&s;wered.</P>
<P>Our a&s;toni&s;hment is further excited, by con&s;idering that the di&s;covery of America has opened a large mart for the <HI>commerce in &s;laves</HI> from the oppo&s;ite continent of Africa. So much has been written and &s;poken on the in|iquity attending this dete&s;table &s;pecies of traf|fic, that I need not attempt again to excite the feelings of indignation and horror, which I doubt not have pervaded the brea&s;t of every per&s;on now pre&s;ent, when contemplating this flagrant in&s;ult on the laws of ju&s;tice and hu|manity. I &s;hall only ob&s;erve, that the fir&s;t intro|duction
<PB N="47" REF="024085_0046_0FC31D2FF10EF5C0">
of the negro &s;lavery into America, was occa&s;ioned by the previous de&s;truction of the native inhabitants of the We&s;t-India i&s;lands, by the cruelty of their Spani&s;h con|querors, in exacting of them more labour than they were able to perform. The mo&s;t remarkable and unaccountable circum&s;tance attending the beginning of this traffic, is, that it was recommended by a Spani&s;h Bi&s;hop, one of the mo&s;t benevolent friends of the In|dians, whom he could not bear to &s;ee &s;o wan|tonly de&s;troyed by his countrymen. When they pre&s;&s;ed him with this difficulty, "How &s;hall our plantations be cultivated if we may not u&s;e the natives as our &s;laves?" He ad|vi&s;ed them to &s;end to Africa, for a more ro|bu&s;t and patient race of men, who could bet|ter bear the fatigue of labour in a warm cli|mate. Thus from a principle of lenity to|ward the &s;avages of America, he introduced the commerce of &s;laves from Africa; which has proved de&s;tructive to human life and happine&s;s, in the &s;ame proportion that it has encouraged avarice, luxury, pride and cruelty.</P>
<P>But do I not &s;ee the dawn of that au&s;pi|cious day which &s;hall put a &s;top to this in|famous
<PB N="48" REF="024085_0047_0FC31D3B8A413E80">
traffic, and &s;hall teach mankind that Africans have a native right to liberty and property as well as Europeans and Americans? May the&s;e rights ever be re&s;pected, and nev|er more be infringed, e&s;pecially by tho&s;e who have &s;ucce&s;sfully contended for the e&s;tabli&s;h|ment of their own.</P>
<P>Let us now turn our attention to another &s;ubject of debate, ari&s;ing from the knowledge of this continent. If the go&s;pel was de&s;igned for an univer&s;al benefit to mankind, why was it not brought by the Apo&s;tles to America, as well as propagated in the &s;everal regions of the old continent? To &s;olve this difficulty, it has been alleged that America <HI>was</HI> known to the ancients; and that it was enlightened by the per&s;onal mini&s;try of the Apo&s;tles.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See an elaborate E&s;&s;ay on this &s;ubject by the late Dr. Samuel Mather.</NOTE> With equal propriety it might be &s;olved, by denying that America was at that time in|habited by any human being, and it might not be impo&s;&s;ible to maintain this negative po|&s;ition, again&s;t any po&s;itive proof which can be adduced to the contrary. But both are attended with difficulties which require more
<PB N="49" REF="024085_0048_0FC31D3CA5DD09F8">
light to unravel than has yet appeared. If America was peopled at that period, perhaps the &s;tate of human &s;ociety was &s;uch, that the wi&s;e and benevolent Author of chri&s;tianity &s;aw no pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s, to the propagation of his go&s;pel here, without the intervention of more and greater miracles, than were con&s;i&s;t|ent with divine wi&s;dom or the nature of man to permit.</P>
<P>Nearly akin to this, is another difficulty. The native inhabitants of Peru, for &s;ome centuries before the Spani&s;h inva&s;ion, are re|pre&s;ented as wor&s;hipers of the &s;un; who&s;e uni|ver&s;ally benignant influence to the world they thought them&s;elves bound to imitate.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Garcila&s;&s;o de la Vega's Royal Commenta|tions of Peru.</NOTE> Ac|cordingly their national character was mild, gentle and humane. They made no offen|&s;ive wars; and when they repelled the inva|&s;ions of their &s;avage neighbours, and conquer|ed them, it was done with a view to reduce them from their native ferocity, under the government of rational and &s;ocial principles; and to incorporate them with them&s;elves, that they might enjoy the benefits of their own pacific &s;y&s;tem. Their code of laws, deliver|ed
<PB N="50" REF="024085_0049_0FC31D3DE7F2E5F0">
by the founder of their empire, was a work of rea&s;on and benevolence, and bore a great re&s;emblance to the divine precepts giv|en by Mo&s;es and confirmed by Je&s;us Chri&s;t. In &s;hort, they &s;eem to have made the neare&s;t approach to the &s;y&s;tem of chri&s;tianity, I mean the moral part of it, of any people who had never been formally in&s;tructed in its princi|ples.</P>
<P>It would &s;eem then to human rea&s;on, that they were fit objects for an apo&s;tolic mi&s;&s;ion; and, that if the pure, &s;imple, original doctrine of the go&s;pel had been preached to them they would readily have embraced it.</P>
<P>But when we find that the&s;e mild and peaceful people were invaded by avaricious Spaniards, under a pretence of converting them to the catholic faith; when in&s;tead of the meek and humble language of a primi|tive evangeli&s;t, we &s;ee a bigoted Friar grave|ly advancing at the head of a Spani&s;h army, and, in a language unknown to the Peruvians, declaring that their country was given to his nation, by the Pope of Rome, God's only vic|ar on earth, and commanding them to re|ceive their new ma&s;ters on pain of death; when we con&s;ider this parade of arrogant hy|pocri&s;y
<PB N="51" REF="024085_0050_0FC31D3FD6D2BA48">
as the &s;ignal for &s;laughter, and &s;ee the innocent victims falling by the &s;word of the&s;e mini&s;ters of de&s;truction; when we &s;ee the whole nation vanqui&s;hed, di&s;heartened, and either murdered or reduced to &s;lavery, by their &s;avage conquerors; when in&s;tead of the wor&s;hip which they addre&s;&s;ed to the lu|minary of heaven, and which needed but one &s;tep more to conduct them to the knowledge of its invi&s;ible Creator, we &s;ee the pomp of Popi&s;h idolatry, with the infernal horrors of the Inqui&s;ition introduced into their country; our a&s;toni&s;hment is excited to the highe&s;t, de|gree, and we can only exclaim, "Thy judg|ments, O Lord, are a great deep! and thy ways are pa&s;t finding out!"</P>
<P>It would give me the greate&s;t plea&s;ure, if in concluding this di&s;cour&s;e I could &s;ay any thing, with re&s;pect to the propagation of chri&s;tian|ity, among the original natives of America, which could be con&s;trued into a fulfilment of the prediction of Daniel, concerning the pro|gre&s;s of knowledge.</P>
<P>Every European nation, which po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es any con&s;iderable &s;hare of the continent, has made this de&s;ireable work a part of their pro|fe&s;&s;ed de&s;ign; in planting and &s;ettling the
<PB N="52" REF="024085_0051_0FC31D4C2F3CE540">
country; and it mu&s;t be acknowledged that &s;ome very zealous and well meant endeavours have been made, by men who had neither wealth nor power in their view; but the &s;uc|ce&s;s has not been an&s;werable to the goodne&s;s of the de&s;ign, nor to the wi&s;hes of tho&s;e who have engaged in it. If we &s;urvey the whole continent, from the fir&s;t di&s;covery of Ameri|ca, to the pre&s;ent time, the number of con|verts to chri&s;tianity, among the Indians, bears but a &s;mall proportion to tho&s;e, who have been de&s;troyed either by war, by &s;lavery or by &s;pirituous liquors. And, with re&s;pect to many of tho&s;e who have been called con|verts, it may ju&s;tly be inquired, whether any thing more can be &s;aid in favour of their con|ver&s;ion, than that they have exchanged their original &s;uper&s;titions, for others, more glit|tering and refined.</P>
<P>If the truths of our holy religion are to be propagated among the &s;avages, it will become us to con&s;ider, whether we had not better fir&s;t agree among our&s;elves, what the&s;e truths are. For whil&s;t they &s;ee diver&s;ities of opinion a|mong us, and that &s;ome of the more zealous advocates of particular tenets, are endeavour|ing to in&s;til the peculiarities of their re&s;pec|tive
<PB N="53" REF="024085_0052_0FC31D4E51B781D8">
&s;ects among them, and to prejudice them again&s;t others; the native &s;agacity with which the&s;e people are endowed will lead them to avoid confounding them&s;elves with our di&s;|tinctions, and to retain the religion of their ance&s;tors, till they can find one, more free from perplexity, than chri&s;tianity appears by the diver&s;ity of our opinions concerning it.</P>
<P>It is al&s;o worthy of con&s;ideration, whether the vicious lives and conduct of our own peo|ple, and e&s;pecially tho&s;e on the frontiers, with whom the Indians are mo&s;t acquainted, be not a great ob&s;truction to the &s;preading of divine knowledge among them. It is very natural to e&s;timate the goodne&s;s of any reli|gion, by the influence which it appears to have on tho&s;e who profe&s;s it; and, if they are to regard the conduct of the people by whom they have been cheated, robbed, and murdered, as a &s;pecimen of the influence of chri&s;tianity on the human mind, it would be a greater wonder that they &s;hould embrace it than reject it.</P>
<P>If the chri&s;tian religion is to be propagated, without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of miracles, among the &s;avages of this continent, it mu&s;t be in &s;ome &s;uch manner as the Moravians have attempt|ed.

The&s;e people &s;eem to have an art of at|taching &s;avage nations to their faith and man|ners, and of forming them into civilized and laborious &s;ociety, beyond any other denomi|nation of chri&s;tians; and, for the honour of the common cau&s;e, I cannot but wi&s;h them all that &s;upport and encouragement which their zealous and benevolent efforts de&s;erve.</P>
<P>It is much to be wi&s;hed, that the &s;pirit of bigotry and the <HI>&s;hibboleth</HI> of party were to|tally aboli&s;hed; that the chri&s;tian religion may appear in its native &s;implicity and pu|rity, and that the profe&s;&s;ors of it would di&s;tin|gui&s;h them&s;elves by that love, that meekne&s;s and gentlene&s;s which marked the character of its author and his primitive followers.

<P>Notwith&s;tanding any pre&s;ent unfavourable appearances, yet we have the greate&s;t rea&s;on to expect that the time will come when knowl|edge will univer&s;ally prevail; when &s;pecu|lative truth will be reduced to practice, and men will be led to a devout acknowledgement of the only true God, and of Je&s;us Chri&s;t

<HEAD><HI>DISSERTATION</HI> I. ON THE CIRCUMNAVIGATION OF <HI>AFRICA</HI> BY THE ANCIENTS.</HEAD>
<P>THE authenticity of hi&s;torical tra|ditions on this &s;ubject hath been que&s;tioned by &s;everal writers ancient and modern. I &s;hall here place in one view, what evidence hath been produced on both &s;ides of the que&s;|tion, as far as I have had opportunity to in|quire; with &s;uch ob&s;ervations as have occur|red to me during the inquiry.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t navigators of whom we have any account were the Phenicians, who were &s;cat|tered along the coa&s;ts of the Mediterranean and of the Red Sea. As early as the days of Mo&s;es, they had extended their navigation beyond the pillars of Hercules, on the we&s;tern coa&s;t of Africa, toward the &s;outh; and as far northward as the i&s;land of Britain, whence they imported tin and lead,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Numbers, Chap. xxxi. ver. 22.</NOTE> which according to the univer&s;al te&s;timony of the ancients, were not then found in any other country.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="024085_0059_0FC31D7603328AE0">From the accounts given in ancient hi&s;|tory of the expeditions of Se&s;o&s;tris, King of Egypt, &s;ome have been led to conclude, that he made a di&s;covery of <HI>all</HI> the coa&s;ts of Af|rica.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">For&s;ter's Hi&s;tory of Voyages and Di&s;coveries, page 7.</NOTE> However this might be, there is no doubt that he opened, or revived a commer|cial intercour&s;e with India and Ethiopia, by way of the Red Sea. It hath al&s;o been thought, that the voyages of the Phenicians and He|brews to Ophir, in the time of Solomon, were nothing more nor le&s;s than circumnaviga|tions of Africa.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE></P>
<P>But, leaving the&s;e for the pre&s;ent in the region of conjecture; the earlie&s;t regular ac|count which we have, of any voyage round the continent of Africa, is that performed by order of Necho, King of Egypt, and recorded by Herodotus; the mo&s;t ancient hi&s;torian, except the &s;acred writers, who&s;e works have come down to our time. His character as a hi&s;torian is, "candid in his acknowledgment of what is uncertain, and ab&s;olute when he &s;peaks of what he knows." The date of Ne|cho's reign is fixed by Rollin 616 years before Chri&s;t. The date of Herodotus's hi&s;tory is
<PB N="61" REF="024085_0060_0FC31D771F0D8238">
placed by Dufre&s;noy in the third year of the 83d Olympiad an&s;wering to 446 years before Chri&s;t. So that he mu&s;t have penned his nar|ration of this voyage, in le&s;s than two cen|turies after it was performed. I &s;hall give his account at large, in a literal tran&s;lation, from the Geneva Edition of his work, in Greek and Latin, by Stephanus.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lib. iv. Cap. 42.</NOTE> In de|&s;cribing the &s;everal great divi&s;ions of the earth, he &s;peaks thus:</P>
<P>"I wonder at tho&s;e who have divided and di&s;tingui&s;hed Libya,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Libya is the name by which the whole continent of Africa was called by the Greeks.</NOTE> A&s;ia and Europe, be|tween which there is not a little difference. If indeed Europe agrees with the others in length, yet in breadth it does not &s;eem to me, worthy to be compared. For Libya &s;hews it|&s;elf to be <HI>&s;urrounded by the &s;ea,</HI> except where it joins to A&s;ia. Necos, King of the Egyptians, being the fir&s;t of tho&s;e, whom we know, to demon&s;trate it. After he had de&s;i&s;ted from digging a ditch from the Nile to the Arabic gulf [in which work above twenty thou&s;and Egyptians peri&s;hed; he betook him&s;elf to rai&s;ing armies and building &s;hips, partly in

Cap. 48.</NOTE>] He &s;ent certain Phenicians in &s;hips, commanding them, that having pa&s;&s;ed the pillars of Hercules, they &s;hould penetrate the north &s;ea, and &s;o return to Egypt. The Phenicians therefore loo&s;ing from the Red Sea, went away into the &s;outhern &s;ea, and, direct|ing their &s;hips to land, <HI>made a &s;eed time,</HI> that when autumn &s;hould come, they might ex|pect a harve&s;t, and might a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly coa&s;t Libya. Then, having gathered the harve&s;t, they &s;ailed.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">"Into whatever part of Libya &s;eamen came, they waited for harve&s;t, and when they had reaped, they loo&s;ed from the &s;hore." (Note of Stephanus.)</NOTE> Thus, two years being con|&s;umed; in the third year, coming round the pillars of Hercules, they returned to Egypt; reporting things which with me have no credit, but may perhaps with others, that <HI>in &s;ailing round Libya they had the &s;un on the right hand.</HI><NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">i. e. They being in the &s;outhern hemi&s;phere and &s;ailing to the we&s;tward, had the &s;un to the right hand or to the northward.</NOTE> In this manner it was fir&s;t known.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="024085_0062_0FC31D84550BE8B0">"In the &s;econd place, there have been Carthaginians, who have &s;aid, that a certain Sata&s;pes, &s;on of Tea&s;pis, a man of the Acha|menides did not &s;ail round Libya, when he was &s;ent; but being deterred by the length of the navigation and the &s;olitude of the country returned home, having not fulfilled the la|bour which his mother enjoined him. For he had violated a virgin daughter of Zopy|rus, the &s;on of Megaby&s;us; and for that cau&s;e, being by Xerxes condemned to be cru|cified, his mother, who was &s;i&s;ter to Darius, liberated him; becau&s;e he &s;aid, he had rath|er impo&s;e on him&s;elf that puni&s;hment, than &s;ubmit to the King's command. Wherefore it became nece&s;&s;ary for him to &s;ail round all Libya, till he &s;hould come to the Arabian Gulf. Xerxes con&s;enting to this, Sata&s;pes went into Egypt, and, having there taken a &s;hip and companions, &s;ailed to the pillars of Hercules. Having pa&s;&s;ed them, and having doubled the promontory of Libya called Sy|loes,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Now called Cape Bojador in the 26th degree of north latitude.</NOTE> he kept a &s;outhern cour&s;e. Having traver&s;ed much of the &s;ea in many months,
<PB N="64" REF="024085_0063_0FC31D85D568F500">
and finding much more time nece&s;&s;ary, he turned about and came back to Egypt. Re|turning to Xerxes, he reported, that in vi&s;it|ing the remote&s;t coa&s;ts, he had &s;een &s;mall men, clothed in Phenician garments; who at the approach of his &s;hips, fled to the moun|tains and left their villages; which he enter|ed, and took nothing from them but cattle. He gave this rea&s;on for not having &s;ailed round Libya, that his &s;hip could &s;ail no far|ther; but was &s;topped. Xerxes did not be|lieve him, and becau&s;e he had not performed his engagement, ordered him to undergo his de&s;tined puni&s;hment."</P>
<P>To the authenticity of this circumnaviga|tion of the African continent, the following objections have been made.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, it is &s;aid that "the ve&s;&s;els which the ancients employed, were &s;o &s;mall as not to afford &s;towage for provi&s;ions, &s;ufficient to &s;ub&s;i&s;t a crew during a long voyage."</P>
<P>Secondly, "their con&s;truction was &s;uch that they could &s;eldom venture to depart far from land, and their mode of &s;teering along the coa&s;t was &s;o circuitous and &s;low, that we may pronounce a voyage from the Mediter|ranean to India, by the Cape of Good Hope,
<PB N="65" REF="024085_0064_0FC31D905FAA8D58">
to have been an undertaking beyond their power to accompli&s;h, in &s;uch a manner as to render it in any degree &s;ub&s;ervient to com|merce. To this deci&s;ion, the account pre|&s;erved by Herodotus of a voyage performed by &s;ome Phenician &s;hips employed by the King of Egypt, can hardly be con&s;idered as repugnant."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Robert&s;on's India, p. 175, American edition. The objections taken from this learned author were not made directly again&s;t the voyage mentioned by Hero|dotus; but rather again&s;t the po&s;&s;ibility of a pa&s;&s;age to India by way of the Atlantic Ocean, and round the Af|rican continent. However, as he brings this voyage into view in the &s;ame argument, and &s;peaks of it dubiou&s;|ly, it is conceived that his &s;entiments are not mi&s;rep|re&s;ented in the above quotations.</NOTE></P>
<P>I have cho&s;en to con&s;ider both the&s;e objec|tions together, becau&s;e that each one helps to de&s;troy the other. For if the ve&s;&s;els were &s;o &s;mall, as not to contain provi&s;ions for a long voyage, this was one rea&s;on for the navigators to keep their cour&s;e near the land; that they might find water fruits, game and cattle on the &s;hore, as well as fi&s;h on the &s;hoals and rocks near the coa&s;t, for their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. And if it was their de&s;ign to keep near the land, for the &s;ake of di&s;covery, &s;mall ve&s;&s;els were be&s;t
<PB N="66" REF="024085_0065_0FC31D91D2E8ED58">
adapted to the purpo&s;e; becau&s;e they could pa&s;s over &s;hoals and through &s;mall openings, between i&s;lands and rocks, which are general|ly &s;ituate near the coa&s;ts of great continents. Be&s;ides, if the ve&s;&s;els were &s;mall they could carry but &s;mall crews, who would not require very large quantities of provi&s;ion.</P>
<P>But Herodotus has helped us to &s;olve the difficulty re&s;pecting provi&s;ions, in a manner perfectly agreeable to the practice of antiqui|ty, though unknown to modern navigators. They went on &s;hore and &s;owed corn, and when it was ripe gathered the harve&s;t. This enables us to account for two circum&s;tances attending the voyage of Necho; the length of time employed, and the &s;upply of pro|vi&s;ion, at lea&s;t of bread, con&s;umed in it.</P>
<P>Nor was this &s;owing and reaping any lo&s;s of time; for the mon&s;oons in the Indian ocean would not permit them to proceed any fa&s;ter. A &s;hip &s;ailing from the Red Sea with the N. E. mon&s;oon, in the &s;ummer or au|tumn, would meet with the S. W. mon&s;oon, in the beginning of December, which mu&s;t have detained her in &s;ome of the harbours, on the ea&s;tern coa&s;t of Africa, till the next April. During this time in that warm climate, corn
<PB N="67" REF="024085_0066_0FC31D9389E036A8">
might be &s;own and reaped; and any other articles, either of provi&s;ion or merchandi&s;e, might be taken on board. Then the N. E. mon&s;oon would carry her to the &s;outhern parts of Africa, into the region of variable winds. This regular cour&s;e and changing of the mon&s;oons was familiarly known to the navigators of Solomon's &s;hips, and was the cau&s;e of their &s;pending three years, in the voyage to and from Ophir. "In going and returning, they changed the mon&s;oon &s;ix times, which made thirty &s;ix months. They needed no longer time to complete the voyage, and they could not perform it in le&s;s."<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Bruce's Travels&mdash;B. II. chap. iv.</NOTE></P>
<P>It is not pleaded, that the voyage of Necho was undertaken for the &s;ake of commerce; or if the authenticity of it were e&s;tabli&s;hed, that it would prove the practicability of a voyage from the Mediterranean to India, round the Cape of Good Hope, by the ve&s;&s;els then in u&s;e, and the nautical &s;kill then acquired. The voyage of which Herodotus &s;peaks might have been a voyage of di&s;covery; &s;uch an one as was perfectly agreeable to the genius of the people by whom it was performed, and of the prince, by who&s;e order and at who&s;e
<PB N="68" REF="024085_0067_0FC31D995EFBAFB8">
expen&s;e it was undertaken. "The progre&s;s of the Phenicians and Carthaginians, in their knowledge of the globe, was not owing en|tirely to the de&s;ire of extending their trade from one country to another. Commerce was followed by its u&s;ual effects, among both tho&s;e people. It awakened curio&s;ity, enlarg|ed the ideas and de&s;ires of men, and incited them to bold enterpri&s;es. Voyages were un|dertaken, the &s;ole object of which was to <HI>di&s;|cover new countries and to explore unknown &s;eas.</HI>"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Robert&s;on's America&mdash;Vol. I. p. 11, 4th edit.</NOTE> The knowledge acquired in the&s;e voyages of di&s;covery might afterward be &s;ub&s;ervient to commerce; and though the Phenicians might not think it convenient, to circumnavigate Af|rica, more than once, yet that they carried on a commercial intercour&s;e with different parts of that country, and particularly with places &s;ituate on the ea&s;tern coa&s;t, in the Indian ocean, we have evidence from the &s;acred writ|ings. In the reign of Solomon "the king's &s;hips with the &s;ervants of Hiram and the navy of Thar&s;hi&s;h every three years brought ivory,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">2 Chron. viii.18. ix.21.</NOTE> apes and peacocks, be&s;ides &s;ilver and the gold of <HI>Ophir,</HI>" which is with great rea&s;on &s;uppo&s;ed
<PB N="69" REF="024085_0068_0FC31D9D0F4E78E8">
to be the country now called <HI>Sofala</HI> on the ea&s;tern coa&s;t of Africa, in the &s;outhern hem|i&s;phere; as the learned Bruce, in his late book of travels, has &s;atisfactorily proved.</P>
<P>The prophet Ezekiel, who was contempo|rary with Necho, King of Egypt, in the ac|count which he gives of the merchandi&s;e of Tyre, enumerates &s;everal commodities, which it is well known belong to Africa, "horns of ivory and ebony, and the per&s;ons of men."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ezekiel, chap. xxvii. ver. 13, 15.</NOTE> We may form &s;ome idea of the &s;trength and materials of the &s;hips of the Tyrians, and of their &s;kill in navigation, from the following pa&s;&s;ages in his apo&s;trophe to Tyrus. "They have made all thy &s;hip-boards of fir trees of Senir; they have taken cedars of Lebanon to make ma&s;ts for thee; of the oaks of Ba&s;han have they made thine oars. Thy wi&s;e men, O Tyrus&punc; were thy pilots. The ancients of Gebal, the wi&s;e men thereof were thy calkers. The &s;hips of Thar&s;hi&s;h did &s;ing of thee; thou wa&s;t repleni&s;hed and made very glorious in the mid&s;t of the &s;eas; thy rowers have brought thee into great waters." Though we have no particular de&s;cription of the &s;ize or model of their &s;hips; yet they certainly had ma&s;ts and
<PB N="70" REF="024085_0069_0FC31DA14F9A52E0">
&s;ails and oars; their pilots and calkers were wi&s;e men, and they were not afraid to &s;ail in great waters, by which is probably meant the ocean, in di&s;tinction from the Mediterranean.</P>
<P>Of the form and &s;tructure of the Grecian ve&s;&s;els we have a more particular knowledge. "They were of incon&s;iderable burden, and mo&s;tly without decks. They had only one ma&s;t, and were &s;trangers to the u&s;e of an|chors."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Robert&s;on's America&mdash;Vol. I. p. 15.</NOTE> But then it mu&s;t be remembered, that "the Phenicians, who in&s;tructed the Greeks in other u&s;eful arts, did not communi|cate to them that exten&s;ive knowledge of nav|igation, which they them&s;elves po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed."<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p 14.</NOTE> We may hence conclude that the &s;hips of the Phenicians were much &s;uperior to the Grecian ve&s;&s;els; that they were fitted with ma&s;ts; &s;ails and oars, and with expert pilots. We have then no evidence from the &s;tructure of their ve&s;&s;els or their mode of &s;ailing, to warrant a doubt of the ability of their &s;hips or &s;eamen, to perform a voyage round the continent of Africa in three years.</P>
<P>To an European theori&s;t &s;uch a voyage may &s;eem le&s;s practicable than to an Ameri|can.
<PB N="71" REF="024085_0070_0FC31DA89A558038">
The Europeans have u&s;ually employed none but &s;hips of great burden, in their trade to India and China; but &s;ince the Ameri|cans have vi&s;ited tho&s;e countries, &s;loops of fifty or &s;ixty tons have &s;ailed round the Cape of Good Hope to China, and round Cape Horn to the northwe&s;t coa&s;t of America, and acro&s;s the north Pacific Ocean. If any doubt can yet remain, it may be entirely re|moved by the recollection of a voyage per|formed in the year 1789, by Lieutenant Bligh of the Briti&s;h navy; who, being turned adrift by his mutinous crew, traver&s;ed the &s;outh Pa|cific Ocean, above twelve hundred leagues, in a boat of twenty three feet long, without a deck, in much &s;tormy weather, with &s;canty provi&s;ions; and having pa&s;&s;ed many danger|ous rocks and &s;hoals, among unknown i&s;lands, arrived in forty one days at a Dutch &s;ettle|ment in the Moluccas.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the printed narrative by Lieut. Bligh.</NOTE> The objections then again&s;t the reality of Necho's voyage, from the &s;ize and &s;tructure of the Pheni|cian ve&s;&s;els, and the want of provi&s;ion are not &s;o formidable on examination as at the fir&s;t appearance.</P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="024085_0071_0FC31DAA95AA0D10">A third objection again&s;t the credibility of this early circumnavigation is, that "&s;everal writers of the greate&s;t eminence among the ancients, and mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed for their knowledge of geography, regarded this ac|count rather as an amu&s;ing tale, than the hi&s;|tory of a real tran&s;action; and, either enter|tained doubts concerning the po&s;&s;ibility of &s;ailing round Africa, or ab&s;olutely denied it."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Robert&s;on's India, p. 175.</NOTE> That the Roman geographers and hi&s;torians did doubt and di&s;believe the &s;tory is very ev|ident; and the cau&s;es are not far to be &s;ought.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t was the jealou&s;y of the Phenici|ans. "Whatever acquaintance with the re|mote regions of the earth the Phenicians or Carthaginians acquired, was concealed from the re&s;t of mankind with a mercantile jealou&s;y. Every thing relative to the cour&s;e of naviga|tion was a &s;ecret of &s;tate as well as a my&s;tery of trade. Extraordinary facts are recorded concerning their &s;olicitude to prevent other nations from penetrating into what they wi&s;h|ed &s;hould remain undivulged."<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Robert&s;on's America, vol. I. p. 13.</NOTE> One of the&s;e extraordinary facts is thus related by Strabo. The Romans being de&s;irous to di&s;|cover
<PB N="73" REF="024085_0072_0FC31DACDE195280">
the places, whence the Carthaginians fetched tin and amber "&s;ent a ve&s;&s;el, with orders to &s;ail in the wake of a Phenician ve&s;|&s;el. This being ob&s;erved by the Carthagi|nian, he purpo&s;ely ran his ve&s;&s;el among rocks and &s;and banks; &s;o that it was lo&s;t, together with that of the inqui&s;itive Roman. The patriotic commander of the former was in|demnified for his lo&s;s by his country."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">For&s;ter's Hi&s;tory of Voyages and Di&s;coveries. chap. I.</NOTE></P>
<P>A &s;econd rea&s;on was the pride of the Ro|mans. If, as Pope tells us&punc;
<Q><L>With hone&s;t &s;corn the fir&s;t fam'd Cato view'd</L>

the &s;ame pride would make their wi&s;e men &s;corn to learn geography or navigation, theo|retically, from tho&s;e who were be&s;t able to teach them. It is acknowledged that the Romans "did not imbibe that commercial &s;pirit and ardor for di&s;covery which di&s;tin|gui&s;hed their rivals."<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Robert&s;on's America, vol.

<PB N="74" REF="024085_0073_0FC31DB0D26B9768">
Romans were famous. Among the Pheni|cians and Carthaginians, the &s;tudy and knowl|edge of their youth were confined to writing, arithmetic and mercantile accounts; whil&s;t polite literature, hi&s;tory and philo&s;ophy were in little repute; and by a law of Carthage, the &s;tudy of the Greek language was prohib|ited; le&s;t any communication &s;hould be car|ried on with their enemies.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rollin's Ancient Hi&s;tory, book II. part I. &s;ect. 7.</NOTE></P>
<P>A third rea&s;on was the opinion which the wi&s;e&s;t men among the Romans had formed, and to which they ob&s;tinately adhered, con|cerning the five zones, and the impo&s;&s;ibility of pa&s;&s;ing from one hemi&s;phere to the other, becau&s;e of the torrid zone lying between. This doctrine of the zones is &s;o fully repre|&s;ented by Dr. Robert&s;on<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Robert&s;on's America, vol.

<P>But notwith&s;tanding the doubts and the infidelity of the Roman Philo&s;ophers, and the great deference paid to them by this learn|ed and cautious inquirer; there is one cir|cum&s;tance which has <HI>almo&s;t</HI> convinced him of
<PB N="75" REF="024085_0074_0FC31DB41F4FF9D8">
the reality of Necho's voyage, as related by Herodotus. It is this, that the Phenicians, in &s;ailing round Africa, "had the &s;un on their right hand;" which Herodotus, with his u&s;u|al mode&s;ty and candor &s;ays, "with me has no credit, though it may with others." On this the Doctor judiciou&s;ly remarks, "The &s;cience of a&s;tronomy was in that early period &s;o im|perfect, that it was by experience only, that the Phenicians could come at the knowledge of this fact; they dur&s;t not, without this, have ven|tured to a&s;&s;ert what would have appeared to be an improbable fiction."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Robert&s;on's India, note 54.</NOTE> Indeed if they had not known it by experience, there is not the lea&s;t conceivable rea&s;on for their invent|ing &s;uch a report; nor even for the entrance of &s;uch an idea into their imagination. The mode&s;t doubt of Herodotus is another argu|ment in favour of the truth and genuinene&s;s of it; for as he had no experience to guide him, and the idea was new, it was very prop|er for him to he&s;itate in admitting it, though he &s;howed his impartiality by in&s;erting it in his relation.</P>
<P>So much for the voyage performed by the Phenicians under the orders of Necho, which
<PB N="76" REF="024085_0075_0FC31DB515F4A6B8">
is the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> proof produced by Herodotus of his po&s;ition that&punc; "Libya is &s;urrounded by the &s;ea, except where it joins A&s;ia."</P>
<P>His <HI>&s;econd</HI> proof is not &s;o conclu&s;ive, nor the de&s;ign of his introducing it &s;o obvious. It is the relation of a voyage undertaken by Sata&s;pes a Per&s;ian, who&s;e puni&s;hment was commuted from crucifixion to &s;ailing round Libya; which voyage he began, but returned by the &s;ame route, not having completed it. The rea&s;on which he gave for returning was, that "his &s;hip was &s;topped and could &s;ail no farther," which his &s;overeign did not believe, and therefore put him to death, to which he had before been condemned.</P>
<P>The only evidence which this &s;tory can af|ford is, that the circumnavigation of the Af|rican continent was, at that time, thought practicable. Sata&s;pes thought &s;o, or he would not have propo&s;ed it to his &s;overeign; and Xerxes thought &s;o, or he would not have di&s;|believed the &s;tory of the &s;hip being &s;topped; by which expre&s;&s;ion was meant that the &s;ea was no farther navigable, by rea&s;on of land.</P>
<P>The exact date of this voyage is not a&s;cer|tained; but as Xerxes reigned twelve years,
<PB N="77" REF="024085_0076_0FC31DB9A037B610">
and died in the year 473 before Chri&s;t, it could not have been much more than thirty years, preceding the time when Herodotus publi&s;hed his hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>The voyage of Hanno the Carthaginian, is thus briefly mentioned by Pliny. "In the flouri&s;hing &s;tate of Carthage, Hanno having &s;ailed round from Gades [Cadiz] to the bord|er of Arabia, committed to writing an account of his voyage; as did Himilco, who was at the &s;ame time &s;ent to di&s;cover the extreme parts of Europe."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pliny's Natural Hi&s;tory, lib. 2, cap. 67.</NOTE> The character of Pliny, as a hi&s;torian is, that "he collected from all au|thors, good and bad, who had written before him; and that his work is a mixture of truth and error, which it is difficult to &s;eparate." An in&s;tance in confirmation of this remark occurs in this very chapter; where he &s;peaks of &s;ome merchants, &s;ailing from India, and thrown by a tempe&s;t, on the coa&s;t of Germa|ny. He al&s;o mentions a voyage, made by Eudoxus; from the Arabian gulf to Gades, and another of Coelius Antipater from Spain to Ethiopia.</P>
<P>Of the&s;e voyages, that of Hanno is be&s;t au|thenticated. He &s;ailed from Carthage with
<PB N="78" REF="024085_0077_0FC31DC0EC51AC30">
&s;ixty gallies, each carrying fifty oars, having on board thirty thou&s;and men and women, with provi&s;ions and articles of traffic. The de&s;ign of this equipment was to plant colo|nies along the we&s;tern &s;hore of Africa, which the Carthaginians, from priority of di&s;cove|ry, and from its contiguity to their territory, con&s;idered as their own dominion. Hanno was ab&s;ent five years, on this colonizing ex|pedition; but there is no <HI>certainty</HI> of his having proceeded any farther &s;outhward, than the Bay of Benin, in the eighth degree of north latitude. A fragment of his journal, which at his return he depo&s;ited in the temple of Saturn, at Carthage, is now extant; and though it has been treated as fabulous by &s;everal authors, ancient and modern, yet its authenticity has been vindicated by M. Bou|gainville, in the 26th volume of the Memoirs of the Royal Academy of In&s;criptions and Belles Lettres; where a French tran&s;lation of it is given from the Greek, into which lan|guage it was rendered from the original Punic.</P>
<P>Concerning the voyage of Eudoxus, the fol|lowing account is given by Bruce.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Travels, book II. chap. V. The voyage of Eudoxus was originally written by <HI>Po&s;idonius,</HI> but I have not met with that author.</NOTE> He was
<PB N="79" REF="024085_0078_0FC31DC2989E0C38">
&s;ent by Ptolemy Euergetes, as an amba&s;&s;ador to India, to remove the bad effects of the King's conduct in the beginning of his reign, who had extorted contributions from mer|chants of that and other trading countries. Eudoxus returned after the King's death, and was wrecked on the coa&s;t of Ethiopia; where he di&s;covered the prow of a &s;hip, which had &s;uffered the &s;ame fate. It was the figure of a hor&s;e, and the &s;ailors, who had been employ|ed in European voyages, knew this to have been part of one of tho&s;e ve&s;&s;els, which traded on the Atlantic ocean; of which trade Gades was the principal port. This circum&s;tance amounted to a proof, that there was a pa&s;&s;age round Africa, from the Indian to the Atlan|tic ocean. The di&s;covery was of no greater importance to any per&s;on, than to Eudoxus him&s;elf; for, &s;ome time afterward, falling un|der the di&s;plea&s;ure of Ptolemy Lathyrus, and being in danger of his life, he fled; and em|barking on the Red Sea, &s;ailed round Africa and came to Gades.</P>
<P>This voyage of Eudoxus was treated as a fable by Strabo, the Roman geographer, who wrote about a century and a half after the
<PB N="80" REF="024085_0079_0FC31DC41C0EC128">
time when it is &s;aid to have been performed. The true cau&s;e of the incredulity of him and of other Roman authors in re&s;pect to the&s;e voyages and di&s;coveries, was the doctrine of the zones, to which they inflexibly adhered, and which effectually precluded all convic|tion.</P>
<P>The&s;e are all the evidences which I have had opportunity to examine re&s;pecting the que&s;tion of the circumnavigation of Africa,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. FORSTER, in his hi&s;tory of Voyages and Di&s;|coveries (chap.

<HEAD><HI>DISSERTATION</HI> II. AN EXAMINATION OF THE PRETENSIONS OF MARTIN BEHAIM, TO A DISCOVERY OF AMERICA, PRIOR TO THAT OF CHRIS|TOPHER COLUMBUS.</HEAD>
<P>SO much has already been well writ|ten on this &s;ubject by Dr. ROBERTSON, that I &s;hould not have thought of adding any thing to it; had not a Memoir appeared in the &s;ec|ond volume of the Tran&s;actions of the Ameri|can Philo&s;ophical Society<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">No. 35, p. 263.</NOTE> at Philadelphia, in which the preten&s;ions of Behaim are re|vived by M. OTTO; who has produced &s;ome authorities which he had obtained from Nu|remberg, an imperial city of Germany, and which appear to him, "to e&s;tabli&s;h in the cleare&s;t manner a di&s;covery of America ante|rior to that of Columbus."</P>
<P>It is conceded that Behaim was a man of learning and enterpri&s;e; that he was con|temporary
<PB N="86" REF="024085_0084_0FC31DDF228474D0">
with Columbus and was his friend; that he pur&s;ued the &s;ame &s;tudies and drew the &s;ame conclu&s;ions; that he was employed by King John II. in making di&s;coveries; and, that he met with de&s;erved honour for the im|portant &s;ervices which he rendered to the Crown of Portugal. But, there are &s;uch dif|ficulties attending the &s;tory of his di&s;covering America, as appear to me in&s;uperable. The&s;e I &s;hall &s;tate; together with &s;ome remarks on the authorities produced by M. Otto.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t of his authorities contains &s;everal a&s;&s;ertions which are contradicted by other hi&s;tories;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Memoirs of Philip de Comines. Mezeray's and Henault's hi&s;tory of France. Collier's Dictionary.</NOTE> (1) That I&s;abella, daughter of John, King of Portugal, reigned after the death of Philip, Duke of Burgundy, &s;urnamed the Good. (2) That to this lady, when regent of the Dutchy of Burgundy and Flanders, Be|haim paid a vi&s;it in 1459, and (3) that hav|ing informed her of his de&s;igns, he procured a ve&s;&s;el in which he made the di&s;covery of the i&s;land of Fayal, in 1460.</P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="024085_0085_0FC31DE712A36878">It is true that Philip, Duke of Burgundy and Flanders, &s;urnamed the Good, married I&s;abella the daughter of John I. King of Portugal; but Philip did not die till 1467, and was immediately &s;ucceeded by his &s;on Charles, &s;urnamed the Bold, then thirty-four years of age. There could therefore have been no interregnum, nor female regent after the death of Philip; and if there had been, the time of Behaim's vi&s;it will not corre&s;pond with it; that being placed in 1459, eight years before the death of Philip. Such a mi&s;take, in point of fact, and of chronology, is &s;ufficient to induce a &s;u&s;picion that the "ar|chives of Nuremberg" are too deficient in ac|curacy to be depended on as authorities.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the di&s;covery of Fayal, in 1460, M. Otto acknowledges that it is "con|trary to the received opinion;" and well he might; for the fir&s;t of the Azores, St. Maria was di&s;covered in 1431; the &s;econd, St. Mi|chael in 1444; the third, Terceira in 1445; and before 1449, the i&s;lands, St. George, Gracio&s;a, Fayal and Pico, were known to the

Portugue&s;e.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">For&s;ter's hi&s;tory of voyages and di&s;coveries, p. 256, 257, Dublin edition.</NOTE> However true it may be that Behaim &s;ettled in the i&s;land of Fayal, and liv|ed there twenty years; yet his claim to the di&s;covery of it mu&s;t have a better foundation than the "archives of Nuremberg," before it can be admitted.</P>
<P>The genuine account of the &s;ettlement of Fayal, and the intere&s;t which Behaim had in it, is thus related by Dr. For&s;ter, a German author of much learning and good credit.</P>
<P>"After the death of the infant Don Henry [which happened in 1463,] the i&s;land of Fayal was made a pre&s;ent of by [his &s;i&s;ter] I&s;abella, Dutche&s;s of Burgundy, to Job&s;t von Hurter, a native of Nuremberg. Hurter went in 1466, with a colony of more than 2000 Flem|ings of both &s;exes, to his property, the i&s;le of Fayal. The Dutche&s;s had provided the Flem|i&s;h emigrants with all nece&s;&s;aries for two years, and the colony &s;oon increa&s;ed. About the year 1486, Martin Behaim married a daught|er of the Chevalier Job&s;t von Hurter, and had a &s;on by her named Martin.&mdash;Job&s;t von Hurter, and Martin Behaim, both natives

<P>The date of the &s;uppo&s;ed di&s;covery of America, by Behaim, is placed by M. Otto, in 1484, eight years before the celebrated voyage of Columbus. In the &s;ame year we are told<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Garcila&s;&s;o de la Vega's Royal commentaries. Preface. Purchas. vol. V. p. 1454.</NOTE> that Alonzo Sanchez de Huelva was driven by a &s;torm to the we&s;tward for twenty-nine days; and &s;aw an i&s;land, of which at his return he gave information to Colum|bus; from both the&s;e &s;uppo&s;ed di&s;coveries this conclu&s;ion is drawn, "That Columbus would never have thought of his expedition to America, had not Behaim gone there before him." Whether it be &s;uppo&s;ed that Behaim and Sanchez &s;ailed in the &s;ame &s;hip, or that they made a di&s;covery of two different parts of America, in the &s;ame year, it is not ea&s;y to under&s;tand from the authorities produced; but what de&s;troys the credibility of this plau|&s;ible tale, is, that Columbus had formed his theory, and projected his voyage, at lea&s;t ten years before; as appears by his corre&s;pond|ence

with Paul, a learned phy&s;ician of Flor|ence, which bears date in 1474.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Life, chap. viii.</NOTE> It is uncer|tain at what time Columbus fir&s;t made his ap|plication to the King of Portugal, to fit him out for a we&s;tern voyage; but it is certain that after a negociation with him on the &s;ub|ject, and after he had found out the &s;ecret and un&s;ucce&s;sful attempt which had been made to anticipate a di&s;covery; he quitted that kingdom in di&s;gu&s;t, and went into Spain, in the latter end of the year 1484.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. chap. xii.</NOTE> The au|thority of the&s;e facts is unque&s;tioned; and from them it fully appears, that a prior di&s;|covery of America, by Behaim or Sanchez, made in 1484, could not have been the foun|dation of the enterpri&s;e of Columbus.</P>
<P>M. Otto &s;peaks of letters written by Behaim in 1486, in the German language, and pre&s;erv|ed in the "archives of Nuremberg" which &s;upport this claim to a prior di&s;covery. As the&s;e letters are not produced, no certain opinion can be formed concerning them; but from the date of the letters, and from the voyages which Behaim actually performed in
<PB N="91" REF="024085_0089_0FC31DFEEABD0270">
the two preceding years, we may with great probability &s;uppo&s;e, that they related to the di&s;covery of CONGO, in Africa; to which Behaim has an uncontroverted claim.</P>
<P>I will now &s;tate the facts relative to this event, partly from the authorities cited by M. Otto; and partly from others.</P>
<P>Dr. Robert&s;on places the di&s;covery of Con|go and Benin in 1483, and with him Dr. For&s;|ter agrees. The authors of the modern uni|ver&s;al hi&s;tory<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vol. XVI. p. 133, 135.</NOTE> &s;peak of two voyages to that coa&s;t, the fir&s;t in 1484; the &s;econd in 1485; both of which were made by Diego Cam,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Diego is the Spani&s;h name of James, in Latin Jacobus. and in Portugue&s;e, Jago. Cam is in Latin, Camus or Canus, and in Spani&s;h, Cano; the&s;e differ|ent names are found in different authors.</NOTE> who is &s;aid to have been one of the mo&s;t ex|pert &s;ailors and of an enterpri&s;ing genius. From the chronicle of Hartman Schedl, as quoted by M. Otto, we are informed, that Behaim &s;ailed with Cam, in the&s;e voyages, which are de&s;cribed in the following terms. "The&s;e two, by the bounty of heaven, coa&s;t|ing along the &s;outhern ocean, and having cro&s;&s;ed the equator, got into the other hem|i&s;phere;
<PB N="92" REF="024085_0090_0FC31E00224BBD48">
where, <HI>facing to the ea&s;tward,</HI> their &s;hadows projected toward the &s;outh, and right hand." No words could be more completely de&s;criptive of a voyage from Portugal to Con|go, as any per&s;on may be &s;atisfied by in&s;pect|ing a map of Africa; but how could M. Ot|to imagine that the di&s;covery of America was accompli&s;hed in &s;uch a voyage as this? "Hav|ing fini&s;hed this cruize (continues Schedl) in the &s;pace of 26 months, they returned to Por|tugal, with the lo&s;s of many of their &s;eamen, by the violence of the climate." This latter circum&s;tance al&s;o agrees very well with the climate of the African coa&s;t;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Brooks's Gazetteer, <HI>Benin.</HI></NOTE> but Schedl &s;ays not a word of the di&s;covery of America.</P>
<P>M. Otto goes on to tell us "that the mo&s;t po&s;itive proof of the great &s;ervices rendered to the crown of Portugal by Behaim, is the rec|ompen&s;e be&s;towed on him by King John II; who in the mo&s;t &s;olemn manner, knighted him, in the pre&s;ence of all his court." Then follows a particular detail of the ceremony of in&s;tallation, as performed on the 18th of Feb|ruary, 1485, and M. Otto fairly owns that this was "a reward for the di&s;covery of Con|go."
<PB N="93" REF="024085_0091_0FC31E019CFF4F30">
Now let us bring the detached parts of the &s;tory together.</P>
<P>Behaim was knighted on the 18th of Feb|ruary, 1485, for the di&s;covery of Congo, in which he had been employed 26 months pre|ceding; having within that time made two voyages thither in company with Diego Cam. It will follow then that the whole of the pre|ceding years, 1484 and 1483 were taken up in the&s;e two voyages. This agrees very well with the accounts of the di&s;covery of Congo, in Robert&s;on and For&s;ter, and does not di&s;a|gree with the modern univer&s;al hi&s;tory, as far as the year 1484 is concerned; which unfor|tunately is the year a&s;&s;igned for Behaim's di&s;|covery of "that part of America called Bra&s;il, and his &s;ailing even to the Straights of Magel|lan."</P>
<P>The only thing in M. Otto's memoir which bears any re&s;emblance to a &s;olution of this difficulty is this. "We may &s;uppo&s;e that Behaim, engaged in an expedition to Congo, was driven by the winds to Fernambouc, and from thence by the currents toward the coa&s;t of Guiana." But &s;uppo&s;itions without proof will avail little; and &s;uppo&s;itions again&s;t
<PB N="94" REF="024085_0092_0FC31E103A936068">
proof will avail nothing. The two voyages to Congo are admitted. The cour&s;e is de&s;|cribed; and the time is determined; and both the&s;e are directly oppo&s;ed to the &s;uppo|&s;ition of his being driven by winds and cur|rents to America. For if he had been driven out of his cour&s;e and had &s;pent "&s;everal years in examining the American i&s;lands, and di&s;covering the &s;traight which bears the name of Magellan;"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Memoirs, p. 269.</NOTE> and if one of tho&s;e years was the year 148<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">, then he could not have &s;pent 26 months preceding February, 1485, in the di&s;covery of Congo; but of this we have full and &s;atisfactory evidence; the di&s;covery of America therefore mu&s;t be given up.</P>
<P>There is one thing further in this memoir which de&s;erves a particular remark, and that is the rea&s;on a&s;&s;igned by M. Otto, for which the King of Portugal declined the propo&s;al of Columbus to &s;ail to India by the we&s;t.

But, not to urge again the chronological difficulty with which this conjecture is embarra&s;&s;ed, I will take notice of two circum&s;tances in the life of Columbus, which militate with this idea. The fir&s;t is, that when Columbus had propo&s;ed a we&s;tern voyage to King John, and he declined it, "The King by the ad|vice of one Doctor Calzadilla, re&s;olved to &s;end a caravel privately, to attempt that which Columbus had propo&s;ed to him; becau&s;e in ca&s;e tho&s;e countries were &s;o di&s;covered, he thought him&s;elf not obliged to be&s;tow any great reward. Having &s;peedily equipped a caravel, which was to carry &s;upplies to the i&s;lands of Cabo Verde, he &s;ent it that way which the admiral propo&s;ed to go. But tho&s;e whom he &s;ent wanted the knowledge, con&s;tancy and &s;pirit of the admiral. After wandering many days upon the &s;ea, they turned back to the i&s;lands of Cabo Verde, laughing at the un|dertaking, and &s;aying it was <HI>impo&s;&s;ible there &s;hould be any land in tho&s;e &s;eas.</HI>"<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Life of Columbus, chap. xi.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="96" REF="024085_0094_0FC31E13A7FE6358">Afterward "the King being &s;en&s;ible how faulty they were whom he had &s;ent with the caravel, had a mind to re&s;tore the admiral to his favour, and de&s;ired that he &s;hould re|new the di&s;cour&s;e of his enterprize; but not being &s;o diligent to put this in execution as the admiral was in getting away, he lo&s;t that good opportunity; the admiral, about the end of the year 1484, &s;tole away privately out of Portugal for fear of being &s;topped by the King."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Life of Columbus, chap. xii.</NOTE> This account does not agree with the &s;uppo&s;ition of a prior di&s;covery.</P>
<P>The other circum&s;tance is an interview which Columbus had with the people of Li&s;|bon, and the King of Portugal, on his re|turn from his fir&s;t voyage. For it &s;o hap|pened that Columbus on his return was by &s;tre&s;s of weather obliged to take &s;helter in the port of Li&s;bon; and as &s;oon as it was known that he had come from the Indies, "the peo|ple thronged to &s;ee the natives whom he had brought and hear the news; &s;o that the cara|vel would not contain them. Some of them prai&s;ing God for &s;o great a happine&s;s; others &s;torming <HI>that they had lo&s;t the di&s;covery through their King's incredulity.</HI>"</P>
<P><PB N="97" REF="024085_0095_0FC31E2328EA3E40">When the King &s;ent for Columbus, "he was doubtful what to do; but to take off all &s;u&s;picion that he came <HI>from his conque&s;ts,</HI> he con&s;ented." At the interview, "the King offered him all that he &s;tood in need of for the &s;ervice of their Catholic Maje&s;ties, though he thought, that fora&s;much <HI>as he had been a captain in Portugal,</HI> that conque&s;t belonged to him. To which the admiral an&s;wered, that he knew of no &s;uch agreement, and that he had &s;trictly ob&s;erved his orders, which were <HI>not to go to the mines of Portugal,</HI> [the gold coa&s;t] nor to Guinea."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Life, chap. xli.</NOTE> Had John II. heard of Behaim's voyage to a we&s;tern continent, would he not have claimed it by priority of di&s;covery rather than by the commi&s;&s;ion which Columbus had formerly borne in his &s;ervice? Had &s;uch a prior di&s;covery been made, could it have been concealed from the people of Li&s;bon? And would they have been angry that their King had lo&s;t it by his incredulity? The&s;e circum&s;tances appear to me to carry &s;ufficient evidence, that <HI>no</HI> di&s;cov|ery of America prior to that of Columbus had come to the knowledge of the King of Portugal.</P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="024085_0096_0FC31E290D1428E8">In an&s;wer to the que&s;tion "Why are we &s;earching the archives of an imperial city for the cau&s;es of an event, which took place in the we&s;tern extremity of Europe?" M. Ot|to gives us to under&s;tand, that "from the fourteenth to the &s;ixteenth centuries, the Ger|mans were the be&s;t geographers, the be&s;t hi&s;|torians and the mo&s;t enlightened politicians." Not to detract from the merit of the German literati of tho&s;e ages, I think we may give equal credit to a learned German author of the pre&s;ent age, Dr. John Reinhold For&s;ter; who appears to have a thorough under&s;tand|ing of the claims not only of his own country|men, but of others. In his indefatigable re|&s;earches into the di&s;coveries which have been made by all nations, though he has given due credit to the adventures of Behaim in Congo and Fayal, yet he has not &s;aid one word of his vi&s;iting America; which he certainly would have done if in his opinion there had been any foundation for it.</P>
<P>He has indeed given us a long detail, with much rea&s;oning, on a di&s;covery made in the 11th century by the Normans, of a country called <HI>Winland</HI>; which he &s;uppo&s;es to be the

<P>I AM very glad to hear of the familiarity you have with your mo&s;t &s;erene and magnifi|cent King; and though I have very often di&s;|cour&s;ed concerning the <HI>&s;hort</HI> way there is from hence to the Indies where the &s;pice is produc|ed, by &s;ea, which I look upon to be &s;horter than that you take by the coa&s;t of Guinea; yet you now tell me that his highne&s;s would have me make out and demon&s;trate it, &s;o as it may be under&s;tood and put in practice. There|fore, though I could better &s;how it him with a globe in my hand, and make him &s;en&s;ible of the figure of the world; yet I have re&s;olved to render it more ea&s;y and intelligible, to &s;how this way upon a chart, &s;uch as are u&s;ed in navigation; and therefore I &s;end one to his maje&s;ty, made and drawn with my own hand; wherein is &s;et down the utmo&s;t bounds of the we&s;t, from Ireland in the north, to the farthe&s;t part of Guinea, with all the i&s;lands that lie in the way. Oppo&s;ite to which we&s;tern coa&s;t is de&s;cribed the beginning of the Indies, with the i&s;lands and places whither you may go, and how far you may bend from the north pole

toward the equinoctial, and for how long a time; that is, how many leagues you may &s;ail, before you come to tho&s;e places mo&s;t fruitful in all &s;orts of &s;pice, jewels and precious &s;tones. Do not wonder if I term that country where the &s;pice grows <HI>we&s;t,</HI> that product being gene|rally a&s;cribed to the ea&s;t; becau&s;e tho&s;e who &s;hall &s;ail we&s;tward will always find tho&s;e places in the we&s;t; and th<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters"> that travel by land ea&s;t|ward will ever find tho&s;e places in the ea&s;t.

I have al&s;o marked down in the &s;aid chart, &s;everal places in India, where &s;hips might put in, upon any &s;torm or contrary winds, or any other accident unfore|&s;een.</P>
<P>Moreover to give you full information of all tho&s;e places which you are very de&s;irous to know; you mu&s;t under&s;tand, that none but traders live or re&s;ide in all tho&s;e i&s;lands, and that there is as great a number of &s;hips and &s;eafaring people with merchandi&s;e, as in any other part of the world; particularly in a mo&s;t noble port called <HI>Zacton,</HI> where there
<PB N="104" REF="024085_0101_0FC318BD20FEF1F8">
are every year a hundred large &s;hips of pepper loaded and unloaded, be&s;ides many other &s;hips that take in other &s;pice.</P>
<P>This country is mighty populous, and there are many provinces and kingdoms, and innumerable cities under the dominion of a prince called the great <HI>Kham,</HI> which name &s;ignifies King of Kings, who for the mo&s;t part re&s;ides in the Province of <HI>Cathay.</HI> His pred|ece&s;&s;ors were very de&s;irous to have com|merce and be in amity with Chri&s;tians; and 200 years &s;ince, &s;ent amba&s;&s;adors to the Pope; de&s;iring him to &s;end them many learned men and doctors to teach them our faith; but by rea&s;on of &s;ome ob&s;tacles the amba&s;&s;adors met with, they returned back, without coming to Rome.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, there came an amba&s;&s;ador to Pope Eugenius IV. who told him the great friend|&s;hip there was between tho&s;e princes, their people and the Chri&s;tians. I di&s;cour&s;ed with him a long while upon the &s;everal matters of the grandeur of their royal &s;tructures, and of the greatne&s;s, length and breadth of their riv|ers. He told me many wonderful things of the multitude of towns and cities founded
<PB N="105" REF="024085_0102_0FC318BEA4B8E8D0">
along the banks of the rivers; and that there were 200 cities upon one river only, with marble bridges over it, of a great length and breadth, and adorned with abundance of pil|lars. This country de&s;erves as well as any other to be di&s;covered; and there may not only be great profit made there, and many things of value found, but al&s;o gold, &s;ilver, all &s;orts of precious &s;tones, and &s;pices in abund|ance, which are not brought into our parts. And it is certain, that many wi&s;e men, phi|lo&s;ophers, a&s;trologers, and other per&s;ons &s;kil|led in all arts, and very ingenious, govern that mighty province, and command their armies.</P>
<P>From Li&s;bon directly we&s;tward, there are in the chart 26 &s;paces, each of which contains 250 miles, to the mo&s;t noble and va&s;t city of <HI>Qui&s;ay,</HI> which is 100 miles in compa&s;s, that is 35 leagues; in it there are ten marble bridges&punc; the name &s;ignifies a heavenly city; of which, wonderful things are reported, as to the inge|nuity of the people, the buildings and the rev|enues. This &s;pace abovementioned is almo&s;t the third part of the globe. This city is in the province of Mango, bordering on that of Cathay, where the King for the mo&s;t part re&s;ides.</P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="024085_0103_0FC318C018A74398">From the i&s;land <HI>Antilla,</HI> which you call the &s;even cities, and <HI>of which you have &s;ome knowl|edge,</HI> to the mo&s;t noble i&s;land of <HI>Cipango</HI> are ten &s;paces, which make 2500 miles, or 225 leagues; which i&s;land abounds in gold, pearls and precious &s;tones; and you mu&s;t under|&s;tand, they cover their temples and palaces with plates of pure gold. So that for want of knowing the way, all the&s;e things are hid|den and concealed, and yet may be gone to with &s;afety.</P>
<P>Much more might be &s;aid, but having told you what is mo&s;t material, and you being wi&s;e and judicious, I am &s;atisfied there is nothing of it, but what you under&s;tand, and therefore I will not be more prolix.

<P>I am glad it is well under&s;tood, and that the voyage laid down is not only po&s;&s;ible, but true, certain, honourable, very advantage|ous and mo&s;t glorious among all Chri&s;tians. You cannot be perfect in the knowledge of it, but by experience and practice, as I have had in great mea&s;ure, and by the &s;olid and true information of worthy and wi&s;e men, who are come from tho&s;e parts to this court of Rome; and from merchants who have traded long in tho&s;e parts, and are per&s;ons of good reputa|tion. So that when the &s;aid voyage is per|formed, it will be to powerful kingdoms, and to the mo&s;t noble cities and provinces; rich and abounding in all things we &s;tand in need of, particularly in all &s;orts of &s;pice in great quantities, and &s;tore of jewels.</P>
<P><PB N="108" REF="024085_0105_0FC318C9E43B96C8">This will moreover be grateful to tho&s;e kings and princes, who are very de&s;irous to conver&s;e and trade with Chri&s;tians of the&s;e our countries; whether it be for &s;ome of them to become Chri&s;tians, or el&s;e to have commu|nication with the wi&s;e and ingenious men of the&s;e parts, as well in point of religion, as in all &s;ciences, becau&s;e of the extraordinary ac|count they have of the kingdoms and govern|ment of the&s;e parts. For which rea&s;ons, and many more that might be alleged, I do not at all admire, that you who have a great heart, and all the Portugue&s;e nation which has ever had notable men in all undertakings, be eagerly bent upon performing this voyage.</P>

<HEAD><HI>DISSERTATION</HI> III. ON THE QUESTION, WHETHER THE HON|EY BEE IS A NATIVE OF AMERICA.</HEAD>
<P>MR. JEFFERSON, in his notes on Virginia, has &s;aid, that "the honey bee is <HI>not</HI> a native of our continent. The Indians concur with us in the tradition that it was brought from Europe, but when, and by whom we know not. The bees have generally ex|tended them&s;elves into the country, a little in advance of the white &s;ettlers, The Indi|ans therefore call them the white man's fly; and con&s;ider their approach as indicating the approach of the &s;ettlement of the whites." He allows that "in Bra&s;il there is a &s;pecies of honey bee, without a &s;ting, but that it is very different from the one we have, which perfect|ly re&s;embles that of Europe." The facts ad|duced by this re&s;pectable author are true; but they will not warrant his conclu&s;ion that "the honey bee, meaning the one re&s;embling that of Europe, is not a native of our conti|nent."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Page 79, American Edition. 121. Engli&s;h.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="024085_0114_0FC318F0D6DD6C90">There is one circum&s;tance in the hi&s;tory of Columbus, which proves that bees were known in the i&s;lands of the We&s;t-Indies, at the time of his di&s;covery. When on his fir&s;t return to Europe he was in danger of peri&s;h|ing at &s;ea, he wrote an account of his di&s;cov|ery on parchment, which he enclo&s;ed in <HI>a cake of wax,</HI> and put into a tight ca&s;k, com|mitting the whole to the &s;ea, in hope of its being driven on &s;hore or taken up. This wax was procured in the i&s;land of Hi&s;paniola<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See his Life, chap. xxx.</NOTE> which he had vi&s;ited, and it was one of the fir&s;t fruits of his di&s;covery.</P>
<P>The indefatigable Purchas gives us an ac|count of the revenues of the empire of Mex|ico, before the arrival of the Spaniards, as de&s;cribed in its annals; which were pictures drawn on cotton cloth. Among other arti|cles he exhibits the figures of covered pots, with two handles, which are &s;aid to be pots of "bees honie."<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Purchas, vol. IV.</NOTE> Of the&s;e pots, two hun|dred are depicted in one tribute-roll, and one hundred in &s;everal others.</P>
<P>This account is confirmed by a late hi&s;tory of Mexico, written by the Abbe Clavigero, a native of Vera Cruz, who from a re&s;idence of
<PB N="119" REF="024085_0115_0FC318F2536535C0">
thirty-&s;ix years in Mexico, and a minute in|quiry into the natural hi&s;tory and antiquities of his country mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed to be well informed, and competent to give a ju&s;t ac|count. He tells us, that a part of every u&s;e|ful production of nature or art was paid in tribute to the Kings of Mexico; and among other articles of revenue he reckons "600 cups of honey" paid annually by the inhabi|tants of the &s;outhern parts of the empire.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Book VII, p. 351, 4 to edit.</NOTE> He al&s;o &s;ays, "that though they extracted a great quantity of wax from the honey comb; they either did not know how, or were not at the pains to make lights of it."</P>
<P>In his enumeration of the in&s;ects of Mex|ico, he reckons &s;ix different kinds of bees which make honey,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Book I, p. 68.</NOTE> four of which have no &s;tings, and of the other two which have &s;tings, one "agrees with the common bee of Europe, not only in &s;ize, &s;hape and colour; but al&s;o in its di&s;po&s;ition and manners, and in the qualities of its honey and wax."</P>
<P>In the account given by Purchas, of the travels of Ferdinando de Soto, in Florida, it is ob&s;erved, that when he came to Chiaha,
<PB N="120" REF="024085_0116_0FC3190082E0D8D0">
which by the de&s;cription was on one of the upper branches of the Mobille, [now in the &s;tate of Georgia] he found among the provi|&s;ions of the natives "a pot full of honie of bees."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Purchas, vol. V. p. 1539.</NOTE> This was A. D. 1540, when there were no Europeans &s;ettled on the continent of America, but in Mexico and Peru.</P>
<P>From the&s;e authorities it is evident that honey bees were known in Mexico and the i&s;lands, before the arrival of the Europeans; and that they had extended as far northward as Florida, a country &s;o denominated from the numberle&s;s flowers, which grow there in wild luxuriance and afford a plenty of food, for this u&s;eful tribe of in&s;ects. The inference is, that bees were not imported by the Span|iards; for however fond they might be of honey as an article of food, or of wax to make tapers for common u&s;e, or for the illumina|tion of their churches; yet as bees were known to be in the country, there could be no need of importing them. The report of honey and wax being found in the i&s;lands, in Mexico, and in Florida, had reached Europe and had been publi&s;hed there long before any emigrations were made to the northward; if
<PB N="121" REF="024085_0117_0FC31901A5E79918">
therefore if the&s;e had been con&s;idered as articles of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence or of commerce; the &s;anguine &s;pirit of the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> adventurers would have rath|er led them to think of <HI>finding</HI> them in Amer|ica, than of tran&s;porting bees from Europe to make them.</P>
<P>As to the circum&s;tance of the bees "ex|tending them&s;elves a little in advance of the white &s;ettlers," it cannot be con&s;idered as a conclu&s;ive argument in favour of their having been fir&s;t brought from Europe. It is well known, that where land is cultivated, bees find a greater plenty of food than in the fore&s;t. The blo&s;&s;oms of fruit trees, of gra&s;&s;es and grain, particularly clover and buck wheat, af|ford them a rich and plentiful repa&s;t; and they are &s;een in va&s;t numbers in our fields and orchards at the &s;ea&s;on of tho&s;e blo&s;&s;oms. They therefore delight in the neighbourhood of "the white &s;ettlers," and are able to increa&s;e in numbers, as well as to augment their quan|tity of &s;tores, by availing them&s;elves of the labour of man. May it not be from this cir|cum&s;tance that the Indians have given them the name of "the white man's fly;" and that they "con&s;ider their approach (or frequent
<PB N="122" REF="024085_0118_0FC319034A5E24F0">
appearance) as indicating the approach of the &s;ettlement of the whites?"</P>
<P>The fir&s;t European &s;ettlement in Virginia was made about &s;eventy years after the expe|dition of Soto, in Florida, and the fir&s;t &s;ettle|ment in New England was ten years po&s;terior to that in Virginia. The large intermediate country was uncultivated for a long time af|terward. The &s;outhern bees therefore could have no inducement, to extend them&s;elves very far to the northward, for many years af|ter the &s;ettlements were begun; and within that time bees were imported from Europe.</P>
<P>That honey and wax were not known to the Indians of New England is evident from this, that they had no words in their language for them. When Mr. ELIOT tran&s;lated the bible into the Indian language, wherever the&s;e terms occurred, he u&s;ed the Engli&s;h words, though &s;ometimes with an Indian termination.</P>
<P>Jo&s;&s;elyn, who vi&s;ited New England fir&s;t in 1638, and afterward in 1663, and wrote an account of his voyages with &s;ome &s;ketches of natural hi&s;tory in 1673, &s;peaks of the honey bee in the&s;e words, "The honey bees are
<PB N="123" REF="024085_0119_0FC3190A5788DF30">
carried over by the Engli&s;h, and thrive there exceedingly."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Voyage to New England, p. 120.</NOTE></P>
<P>There is a tradition in New England, that the per&s;on who fir&s;t brought a hive of bees into the country was rewarded with a grant of land; but the per&s;on's name, or the place where the land lay, or by whom the grant was made, I have not been able to learn.</P>
<P>It appears then, that the honey bee <HI>is</HI> a na|tive of America, and that its productions were found by the fir&s;t European vi&s;itors as far northward as Florida and Georgia. It is al|&s;o true that bees were imported from Europe into New England, and probably into Virgi|nia; but whether, if this importation had not taken place, the bees of the &s;outhern parts would not have extended them&s;elves norther|ly, or whether tho&s;e which we now have are not a mixture of native and imported bees, cannot be determined. It is however certain that they have multiplied exceedingly, and that they are frequently found in New Eng|land, in a wild &s;tate, in the trunks of hollow trees, as far northward as cultivation and &s;et|tlements have extended, which is nearly to the forty-fifth degree of latitude.</P>
<P><PB N="124" REF="024085_0120_0FC3190FF7C603E0">I have made inquiry of &s;everal per&s;ons from Canada; but have not learned that bees were known during their re&s;idence in that country. It is however not improbable that as culti|vation extends, the bees may find their way to the northward of the lakes and river of Ca|nada, even though none &s;hould be tran&s;port|ed thither by the inhabitants.</P>

<HEAD><HI>DISSERTATION</HI> IV. ON THE COLOUR OF THE NATIVE AMERI|CANS, AND THE RECENT POPULATION OF THIS CONTINENT.</HEAD>
<P>IT has been queried, "if the black|ne&s;s of the Africans and the Ea&s;t Indians with|in the torrid zone, be the effect of climate; why are not the original natives of America, within the &s;ame latitudes equally black?"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">American Mu&s;eum, 1790&mdash;p. 78.</NOTE></P>
<P>That the blackne&s;s mentioned is the effect of climate is generally admitted by philo&s;ophi|cal writers. Their meaning is, that the ex|ce&s;&s;ive heat of the climate, in a long &s;eries of time, produces this effect. The heat of a country depends not only on its proximity to the equator; but on its particular and rela|tive &s;ituation. A plain is hotter than a moun|tain, a continent is hotter than an i&s;land, and one &s;ide of a continent is hotter than the other. Though almo&s;t all the countries and i&s;lands of A&s;ia and Africa, between the tropics, have black inhabitants; yet there is a diver&s;ity in
<PB N="126" REF="024085_0122_0FC3191AF3A95780">
the &s;hades of their &s;able hue, as well as in the form of their hair. The cri&s;ped woolly head|ed inhabitants of the we&s;tern coa&s;t of Africa, are &s;aid to be the blacke&s;t of mankind, becau&s;e that country, from its peculiar &s;ituation, re|ceives and retains a greater degree of heat than any other part of the globe; the ea&s;terly winds which pa&s;s over that continent being extremely heated in their pa&s;&s;age. The &s;ame wind (which at &s;ea is called the trade wind) is cooled in pa&s;&s;ing over the Atlantic. The ea&s;tern parts of South America are much cooler than the oppo&s;ite coa&s;t of Africa, in the &s;ame latitude; and the natives of Guiana and Bra&s;il are of a brown colour. Between Bra|&s;il and Peru are &s;ituate tho&s;e lofty mountains, the Andes; which again arre&s;t and cool the ea&s;terly wind&punc; before it reaches the we&s;tern coa&s;t of America; and, the inhabitants of Peru are of a lighter colour than tho&s;e of Bra|&s;il. Mexico is in the &s;ame latitude with Se|negal and Gambia; the inhabitants of the two latter countries are black, whil&s;t tho&s;e of the former are of an olive complexion, which is &s;uppo&s;ed to have been the original colour of the human &s;pecies.</P>
<P><PB N="127" REF="024085_0123_0FC3191D0DF351D0">This account is conformable to that given by the celebrated naturali&s;t, Buffon; but he has al&s;o formed an opinion, which, if it were admitted, might &s;olve the que&s;tion in another way. He conjectures that America is "of a much more recent exi&s;tence" than the old con|tinent; that it mu&s;t have remained buried under the waters of the &s;ea much longer; and has but lately emerged from the waves. In illu&s;tration of this conjecture he a&s;ks, "if this continent be really as ancient as the other, why did &s;o few men exi&s;t on it? Why were tho&s;e few &s;avage and di&s;per&s;ed? Why did the inhabitants of Mexico and Peru, (the only ones which had the &s;malle&s;t degree of &s;ociety) reckon only two or three hundred years from the time that they were fir&s;t a&s;&s;embled to|gether?" He might have gone on with his queries thus&mdash;Why are not the inhabitants of the torrid zone in America, of as dark a com|plexion as tho&s;e of the A&s;ian i&s;lands, and the ea&s;tern &s;ide of the African continent? For it is well known, that <HI>length of time</HI> as well as <HI>heat of climate,</HI> is nece&s;&s;ary to produce any great and permanent change in the human colour.</P>
<P><PB N="128" REF="024085_0124_0FC3192123229930">This conjecture of the late emer&s;ion of the American continent from the waters of the ocean, advanced by Buffon, De Paw, and other European theori&s;ts, appears to me at|tended with an in&s;uperable difficulty. For whil&s;t buried in the water it mu&s;t either have been &s;unk below, or the water mu&s;t have been rai&s;ed above the pre&s;ent level of the continent. On the former &s;uppo&s;ition, there mu&s;t have been &s;ome mighty convul&s;ion of nature, and of very long continuance; to rai&s;e &s;o im|men&s;e a bulk from the bottom of the ocean to its pre&s;ent elevation; and the water which covered it mu&s;t have been &s;o driven back on all &s;ides, as to have made great encroachments on the &s;hores of the other continent and i&s;lands of the globe. Or, on the latter &s;uppo&s;ition, that the water was rai&s;ed above the pre&s;ent level of America, it would have been impo&s;|&s;ible, for that element to pre&s;erve its equilib|rium, according to the laws of hydro&s;tatics, without at the &s;ame time overwhelming the ancient continent. This difficulty renders the conjecture inadmi&s;&s;ible, without &s;ome hi&s;|torical proof of the exi&s;tence of the&s;e effects.</P>
<P><PB N="129" REF="024085_0125_0FC319226CD43DF8">But, though the antiquity of America be al|lowed equal to the re&s;t of the world&punc; yet it is po&s;&s;ible that its <HI>population</HI> may be more recent. It is very certain that the annals of Mexico and Peru extended back but a few centuries pre|vious to the Spani&s;h inva&s;ion. If we are to believe them, Manco Capac, the founder of the Peruvian monarchy, was contemporary with Henry II. of England, in the twelfth century; and the Mexican empire was e&s;tab|li&s;hed in the fourteenth. The mo&s;t elaborate inve&s;tigation of the late hi&s;torian Clavigero, carries the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> population of Mexico by the Toltecas, no further back than the &s;eventh century of the Chri&s;tian Aera. Beyond that, they had no tradition, excepting that their ance&s;tors came from the north we&s;t.</P>
<P>If any analogy can be drawn from the prog|re&s;s which the ancient A&s;&s;yrians and Egyp|tians made from a rude to a civilized &s;tate; that is, to the &s;ame degree of improvement which the Mexicans and Peruvians had at|tained; there could not have intervened more than four or five centuries, from their fir&s;t ar|rival in America, to the appearance of Man|co. This calculation will bring the time of
<PB N="130" REF="024085_0126_0FC3192C131BE820">
the population of America, five or &s;ix centu|ries within the Chri&s;tian Aera.</P>
<P>Since modern voyagers have di&s;covered the Pacific Ocean to be full of i&s;lands, and tho&s;e i&s;lands full of people, many of whom are well &s;killed in navigation, the population of the we&s;tern parts of America, from the ea&s;t|ern &s;hores and i&s;lands of A&s;ia is rendered more credible than ever; and if the Mexi|cans and Peruvians came originally from the north of China or Corea, they might proba|bly bring &s;ome degree of refinement with them, beyond what tho&s;e had who found their way hither from the more northern de|&s;arts of Tartary. If this could be a&s;certained, it would greatly &s;trengthen the argument for the recent population of America, and help us to account for the difference between the inhabitants of tho&s;e celebrated empires, and the wild wanderers in the northern regions of this va&s;t continent; which is very analagous to the difference between the people of China, and the roving Tartars in the northern fore&s;ts of A&s;ia.</P>
<P>In &s;uch an inquiry, where &s;o little light can be derived from hi&s;tory or tradition, the
<PB N="131" REF="024085_0127_0FC3193124169620">
mind is apt to re&s;t, perhaps too much on cir|cum&s;tantial proofs which &s;eem to favour an hypothe&s;is. Let this be my apology, if any be nece&s;&s;ary, for introducing the following quotation from the learned Dr. For&s;ter.</P>
<P>"From the year 1259 to 1294 of the Chri&s;|tian Aera, reigned KUBLAI-KHAN, [Sove|reign of Tartary, who&s;e re&s;idence was in Ka|thay, the northern part of China, and who&s;e capital was a part of the pre&s;ent city of Pe|king.] He &s;ent a fleet and army to Niphon, or Japan for the purpo&s;e of conquering that country. The &s;hips compo&s;ing his fleet were very much &s;hattered by &s;torms, and it is prob|able that &s;ome of them were not able to get back to Japan or China. About this period there &s;prung up in America almo&s;t at one and the &s;ame time, two great empires, Mexico and Peru, which had regular in&s;titutes of religion; notions of rank and &s;ubordinations, were in &s;ome mea&s;ure civilized; were connected with each other by various kinds of a&s;&s;ociation; practi&s;ed agriculture; and in the matrimo|nial &s;tate did not allow polygamy.

cultivation; notwith&s;tanding that both the&s;e empires are &s;urrounded on all &s;ides by &s;avage and rude nations, very incon&s;iderable in point of extent, and are be&s;ides at a di&s;tance from each other. All this favours the &s;uppo&s;ition, that the&s;e two colonies came thither by &s;ea, in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries; per|haps they are &s;ome of the people who were lo&s;t in the expedition to Japan&punc; their &s;hips having been driven by the &s;torm to Amer|ica." <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">For&s;ter's Hi&s;tory of Voyages and Di&s;coveries, chap.
