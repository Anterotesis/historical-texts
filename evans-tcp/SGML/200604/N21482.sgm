<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THIS Letter was written at Chambery in Savoy, in December, 1792, at the reque&s;t of tho&s;e members of the National Convention who were then in that country, for the purpo&s;e of or|gani&s;ing the department of Mont Blanc. It was printed in French at Grenoble, and in Italian at Nice, and &s;ent from tho&s;e places into Piedmont, and other parts of Italy, during that winter.</P>
<P>It will occur to the reader of the Engli&s;h copy, which now appears for the fir&s;t time in print, that the defection of Dumourier, in April 1793, the violent factions which di&s;tracted the Convention, and the &s;ub&s;equent civil commotions in many parts of France, occupied the attention of the Republi|cans the remainder of that year. Their opera|tions again&s;t the league of foreign enemies (which was now augmented by the addition of England, Holland, Spain and Naples) were confined for that campaign to the defence of the frontiers; and they were thus prevented from pu&s;hing the exten&s;ive advantages which they had gained the year before.</P>
<P>This circum&s;tance relieved the King of Sar|dinia from the de&s;pair in which he had been plunged. It gave him time to augment his for|ces and repair his fortifications. It gave him ar|guments again&s;t the French and the principles of the revolution, and thus enabled him in &s;ome de|gree to unite his people in favour of the &s;y&s;tem of de&s;poti&s;m to which they had been accu&s;tomed; for it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that the manner in which the French affairs were conducted that year, had a
<PB N="iv" REF="028237_0004_0FD743F10EDE1378">
&s;trong tendency to excite a di&s;reli&s;h to their cau&s;e in the minds of di&s;tant or ignorant ob&s;ervers. In addition to all the&s;e advantages, he received a &s;ub&s;idy from England, to enable him to defend his own dominions; by the aid of which he has &s;ince obtained a large body of auxiliary troops from Tirol, Milan, and Tu&s;cany.</P>
<P>The&s;e unexpected events produced a remark|able change in the relative &s;ituation of the French and Piedmonte&s;e, from the clo&s;e of the fir&s;t cam|paign to the clo&s;e of the &s;econd. But the third is now opened with as much advantage to the French as the mo&s;t ardent republican could expect. The troops de&s;tined for the inva&s;ion of Italy this year, did not amount to more than one tenth of the military force that they now have in motion on the Continent. Yet the&s;e have already pa&s;&s;ed the Alps in three different directions, and are at this time ma&s;ters of a con&s;iderable part of Pied|mont. It is probable that this campaign will e&s;tabli&s;h the revolution in that country, but un|happily with more expence of blood than was ex|pected from former appearances. Could the &s;ame force have been employed there the la&s;t year, under the circum&s;tances that then exi&s;ted, we may pre&s;ume it would have met but little op|po&s;ition; and the writer might have had the &s;a|tisfaction of &s;eeing that his letter had produced &s;ome effect in promoting the cau&s;e of liberty and happine&s;s in that intere&s;ting part of the world.</P>

<SALUTE>CITIZENS OF PIEDMONT,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU occupy one of the &s;tronge&s;t fron|tiers of a country which nature &s;eems to have de&s;tined to be the happie&s;t in Europe. But a number of imperious circum&s;tances, of which you have been rather the victims than the authors, have for many centuries inverted the order of things, and deprived you of tho&s;e advantages which ought to attend your &s;itua|tion. I am a &s;tranger in this part of the world; Italy is known to me only from its hi&s;tory, and your pre&s;ent condition only from di&s;tant ob&s;ervation and report. It is not pro|bable that I &s;hall ever have the plea&s;ure of &s;ee|ing you or any part of your country. You mu&s;t, therefore, acquit me of entertaining any de&s;ire to mi&s;lead you, as I can have no po&s;|&s;ible intere&s;t in addre&s;&s;ing you this letter, but the intere&s;t which the human heart naturally takes in uttering the truth on a very important
<PB N="6" REF="028237_0006_0FD743F6387DEDE8">
&s;ubject. You are my fellow-creatures; as &s;uch I love you, and cheri&s;h the ties which ought to be mutual between us. You are in a condition which appears to me to call up|on you to bur&s;t the bands of &s;lavery; in this view, I am ready to hail you as brothers, and wi&s;h to aid you in your work.</P>
<P>I pre&s;ume in the fir&s;t place, and I think I am not deceived, that you are di&s;contented with your pre&s;ent &s;ituation. I believe you are convinced that you cannot be happy, as a peo|ple, while the powers of your government remain as they now are, as relative to the church, the &s;tate; and the army. If this be true, you mu&s;t wi&s;h for a change; provided &s;uch change can be within your power, and provided you are convinced that it would be for your advantage. Let us examine the&s;e two points: whether you are able to effect a revolution in your government; and if you are, whether you would be benefited by it.&mdash; For it is not my wi&s;h to hurry you into mea|&s;ures, of which you cannot &s;ee the i&s;&s;ue, and for which you are not prepared.</P>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="point">
<HEAD><HI>I.</HI> Are you able to effect a revolution in your government?</HEAD>
<P>This que&s;tion need never be a&s;ked of any peo|ple, when con&s;idered with reference to them|&s;elves only, without regard to their neighbours. A whole people is e&s;&s;entially &s;overeign.
<PB N="7" REF="028237_0007_0FD743F7267B49B0">
They can at all times do as they plea&s;e with their own affairs, unle&s;s they are overpowered by &s;urrounding nations. It is the people who &s;upport the government as it now is; and the &s;ame &s;overeign people can at any time change its form, and &s;upport it in whatever manner it &s;hall plea&s;e them be&s;t. The que&s;|tion has no difficulty in it, but when viewed with reference to the intere&s;t which other go|vernments may have in preventing a revolu|tion in their neighbourhood.</P>
<P>The enquiry, pur&s;ued in this connexion, be|comes more exten&s;ive; e&s;pecially when ap|plied to a country of &s;mall dimen&s;ions, and to a nation le&s;s powerful than &s;ome of its neigh|bours. Such is Piedmont. Had you been called upon &s;even years ago to look into your affairs, and take the government into your own hands, you mu&s;t have con&s;idered it as a dangerous experiment. Even &s;uppo&s;ing the weight of your &s;ufferings to have been as great then as they are now, and &s;uppo&s;ing you had been po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the &s;ame information which you have &s;ince drawn from the progre&s;s of liberty in Europe, it would &s;carcely have been prudent for you to have engaged in &s;o daring an enterpri&s;e. All the tyrants in your neigh|bourhood would have brought forward their armies of &s;laves to cru&s;h the rebellion. The French court would have been, at that time, as much your enemy as the French nation is now your friend. And the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria,
<PB N="8" REF="028237_0008_0FD743FF60E979E0">
with all the &s;ubdivi&s;ions of its power in Italy, po&s;ted at your gates, would have united with that of Bourbon, to have guaranteed your king in every po&s;&s;ible extent of his oppre&s;|&s;ion.</P>
<P>Under the&s;e di&s;advantages your &s;truggles for liberty might have been <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">; they might even have produced a new injury, in&s;tead of relieving you from the old. But the ground is now changed; the duty you owe to your|&s;elves is clearly pointed out by the natural cur|rent of events; and the work you have to do, in e&s;tabli&s;hing a perfect and undi&s;turbed li|berty, is in my opinion much ea&s;ier than you imagine. France is at this time, not only the mo&s;t powerful nation in Europe, but when engaged, as &s;he now is, in defence of liberty, &s;he is a match for all the other pow|ers of Europe, when united in defence of ty|ranny. France is now your natural friend, the friend of all people and the enemy of all tyrants. She is indeed the only friend you have as a nation in this part of the world. France has brought liberty to your doors; and &s;he invites you, in the name of all that is dear to you as men, in the name of all that can bind you to the intere&s;ts of human nature in general, to accept the ble&s;&s;ing at her hands. She has done more; &s;he has taught you and all other people how public happine&s;s is to be acquired and pre&s;erved. She has addre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf to the great principles of rea&s;on which
<PB N="9" REF="028237_0009_0FD74404CA053B38">
are common to all men; &s;he has cleared away the ma&s;s of prejudice, of fal&s;e doctrine, of &s;uper&s;tition in the &s;cience of morals; a ma&s;s which the complicated abu&s;es of tyranny, con|tinued for many centuries, had accumulat|ed on the human mind. She has laid down and clearly defined the rights and duties of man and of citizens, explained the great doc|trine of equality, the true de&s;ign of govern|ment, the nature of the tru&s;t to be repo&s;ed in public officers, as &s;ervants of the people, by whom they are created and by whom they are paid. She has taught you a great practi|cal truth, which is too con&s;oling to be reject|ed, and too clear to be called in que&s;tion, <HI>that you are the &s;overeigns in your own country;</HI> that you have not, that you cannot have a ma&s;ter, unle&s;s you choo&s;e to give up your rea&s;on, and renounce the character of men; that for any man to call him&s;elf your &s;overeign is a bla&s;|phemy again&s;t God the &s;overeign of nature, and again&s;t men the proprietors of the earth.</P>
<P>Obligations of gratitude are due to the French nation from you, and from every people in Europe. She has conquered liberty for all men, and laid the foundation for uni|ver&s;al public felicity. Other nations have only to build the &s;uper&s;tructure, of which the model is given them in the con&s;titution of this great republic.</P>
<P>But let us not amu&s;e our&s;elves with words, nor re&s;t the argument on theoretical principles,
<PB N="10" REF="028237_0010_0FD7440628AA6680">
however inconte&s;tible they may be. Let us &s;peak of facts that are pa&s;&s;ing before our eyes, and call to mind the events of the great year that is now drawing to a clo&s;e. You have &s;een the principal tyrants and the mo&s;t formi|dable armies of Europe, combined and march|ing in the full career of promi&s;ed victory again&s;t the liberties of France. The&s;e armies, after &s;weeping over half Europe and fami&s;hing whole countries in their way to the French frontiers, have there been cut to pieces by a handful of freemen, and driven out of their country. Liberty has marched on the heels of the fugitives; the arch tyrant of Au&s;tria, at the head of this fatal con&s;piracy of kings, has lo&s;t the fine&s;t part of his dominions; many of the &s;ubaltern princes of the Empire have lo&s;t the whole of theirs, and are now beggars abroad among their brother brigands, who are in expectation of the &s;ame inevitable fate. The &s;tandard of liberty has reached the bor|ders of the Rhine by the mi&s;carriage of the &s;ame combination which has brought it to the &s;ummit of the Alps.</P>
<P>All the crowned heads in Europe are now covered with thorns. The man of Turin, who calls him&s;elf your king, has been forced to relinqui&s;h one half of the u&s;urpations of his ance&s;tors, and is now menacing you with de|&s;truction for fear you &s;hould reclaim the re&s;t. The Duchy of Savoy and the county of Nice, more fortunate than you, have been the fir&s;t
<PB N="11" REF="028237_0011_0FD74407A58ED288">
to ca&s;t off his yoke, and are now ready to a&s;|&s;i&s;t you with their arms to follow their exam|ple. The Pope and the other Italian de&s;pots, are occupied in re&s;training the &s;pirit of liberty at home; &s;o that no one of the neighbouring powers is in a condition to take any con&s;ider|able part in your affairs, except the French; and the French are wi&s;hing to give you every aid that you may a&s;k.</P>
<P>Under the&s;e circum&s;tances, we need no longer enquire whether you are able to effect a revolution; the more natural que&s;tion is, are you able to re&s;i&s;t it? It is true, the French have renounced all ideas of conque&s;t, and have declared that they will never make war again&s;t the liberty of any people. But you will ob&s;erve that this principle contains in it|&s;elf a declaration of war again&s;t all tyrants who are ho&s;tile to the liberty of France; e&s;pecially again&s;t tho&s;e who&s;e vicinity renders them dangerous to the internal peace of the new republic, by fo&s;tering its fugitive traitors, and being the centre of new con&s;piracies again&s;t the rights of man. The court of Turin comes under this de&s;cription. It is ho&s;tile to the liberties of France; it has been &s;o from the beginning; the nature of its ex|ternal connexions and of its internal con&s;titu|tion requires that it &s;hould be &s;o to the end. The court of Turin mu&s;t, therefore, be over|turned; the government of your country mu&s;t
<PB N="12" REF="028237_0012_0FD7441249AA9048">
be changed, and its powers re&s;tored to you, to whom they naturally belong.</P>
<P>This is a &s;imple view of facts, which may &s;erve to indicate the pre&s;ent cri&s;is of your af|fairs, of which it is proper you &s;hould be ap|pri&s;ed; that by a due con&s;ideration of the cau&s;es you may not be a&s;toni&s;hed at the ef|fects. I make known to you my opinion, with all the frankne&s;s that the &s;olemnity of the &s;ubject demands; and it &s;eems almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible that you &s;hould fail to turn the con&s;equences to your advantage.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="point">
<HEAD>II. The more important que&s;tion to be di&s;|cu&s;&s;ed, is <HI>Whether you will be benefited by</HI> a revolution in your government?</HEAD>
<P>Many of you will doubtle&s;s con&s;ider this enquiry as &s;uperfluous, becau&s;e your condi|tion can &s;carcely be rendered wor&s;e, and the means of rendering it better are &s;o obvious that they cannot e&s;cape the &s;lighte&s;t ob&s;erva|tion. But tho&s;e of you who are accu&s;tomed to reflect on the principles of liberty will pardon the &s;implicity of the enquiry, in fa|vour of the great ma&s;s of the people whom it is our duty to in&s;truct. There has been &s;o much fal&s;ehood and folly impo&s;ed on that cla&s;s of mankind, in order to deba&s;e and bru|talize their minds to the level of their condi|tion, that their ignorance has become preter|natural; it is almo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary to begin their
<PB N="13" REF="028237_0013_0FD744152E586910">
in&s;truction by informing them that they are human creatures. But, citizens of Italy, de|&s;cendants of Brutus and Cato, this &s;tate of degradation is not the condition de&s;igned for man. The God of equal liberty has allotted you a different birthright; you are now invited to reclaim your inheritance, to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of your portion among your brethren, to enjoy it in peace, and re&s;tore harmony to the great family of men.</P>
<P>You have been fatally mi&s;informed with re&s;pect to the nature of the French revolu|tion, and the events that have attended it. Your religious teachers and your political ma&s;ters have an intere&s;t in deceiving you. They unite their efforts for this purpo&s;e; they blind your eyes, as you blind the eyes of a mill-hor&s;e, that he may not &s;ee his harne&s;s, nor con&s;ider the weight he draws. If the mill-hor&s;e could know that he has only a fee|ble child for a conductor, and that he is made to go con&s;tantly round in the &s;ame &s;mall cir|cle, &s;o that he cannot hope to come nearer his journey's end; e&s;pecially if he could look into the neighbouring fields and &s;ee the other hor&s;es enjoying their liberty, he would &s;oon revolt again&s;t his little de&s;pot, he would grow di&s;couraged with the &s;ame unpromi&s;ing round of fatigue, and refu&s;e to do his work. It is for this rea&s;on that you blind his eyes. My friends, the &s;ame arts are u&s;ed with you. The clergy and the nobles of your country,
<PB N="14" REF="028237_0014_0FD7441533E90C18">
with a man at their head whom they call a King, do nothing but live upon your labours. They cannot &s;upport their luxury by any other means than by keeping you con&s;tantly at work. They know that if you were to be informed of their weakne&s;s and of your own &s;trength, you would refu&s;e to be their drudges. They are &s;en&s;ible that the moment you open your eyes, you will &s;ee that they are but men, that all men are equal in their rights, that they have no more right or power to be kings and lords over you than you have to be kings and lords over them; and that in con&s;equence of this, you would immediately overturn that abomi|nable &s;y&s;tem of public robbery which they call a government, and e&s;tabli&s;h a new and equal government, which &s;hould &s;ecure to every man the fruits of his own labours, protect the innocent, puni&s;h the guilty, and in&s;truct every member of &s;ociety in his duties and his rights.</P>
<P>This is preci&s;ely what the people of France have done; and the performance of this great work, &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to the happine&s;s of man|kind, is called the French Revolution. It is the knowledge of this revolution which your court and clergy wi&s;h to conceal from you, le&s;t you &s;hould follow the example. They prevent the French news-papers from coming into your country; they forbid the reading of all books that treat of this revolution, and all conver&s;ation on that or any other political &s;ubject; they have &s;hut up the popular thea|tres
<PB N="15" REF="028237_0015_0FD74416A0DD73C0">
at Turin, and left open none but that of the nobility, from which the citizens are ex|cluded; they have &s;uppre&s;&s;ed the great uni|ver&s;ity of that capital, called <HI>the Univer&s;ity of the Provinces,</HI> which u&s;ed to bring &s;tudents from all parts of Italy, and a con&s;iderable emolument to the town; they have doubled the number of their &s;pies, and increa&s;ed the powers of the police.</P>
<P>All this is to keep you ignorant of the French revolution, that you may not be di&s;|po&s;ed to follow the example. Ob&s;erve the in&s;ult offered to your under&s;tanding. If the example were bad, your good &s;en&s;e would teach you to &s;hun it; it would need only to be known, to be de&s;pi&s;ed; and it ought to be explained to all people, that they might learn to avoid &s;uch a dangerous innovation. If it be good, it ought to be taught by your teach|ers, and imitated by all the world. But be a&s;&s;ured that the very caution they u&s;e to pre|vent your coming to the knowledge of the fact, is a proof that &s;uch a revolution would be an advantage to you and a di&s;advantage to them.</P>
<P>But this is not all; they have invented a thou&s;and fal&s;ehoods to &s;upply the place of truth. They have told you lies, in order to excite your enmity again&s;t your be&s;t friends, and to rou&s;e you to war again&s;t tho&s;e princi|ples which ought to be as dear to you as to the French; becau&s;e they are the principles of
<PB N="16" REF="028237_0016_0FD74419D27E4890">
equal liberty and national happine&s;s, applica|ble to all people. They have told you that the French nation is a race of robbers, a&s;&s;a&s;|&s;ins and athei&s;ts; that they have overturned the religion of their country, waged war again&s;t all property and again&s;t the lives of its owners. The&s;e are impudent fal&s;ehoods which never could have been impo&s;ed upon you for a moment, had you been permitted to judge for your&s;elves.</P>
<P>With regard to religion, I only reque&s;t you to look into the fir&s;t principles of liberty, as declared by the National A&s;&s;embly. You will find them conformable to the &s;y&s;tem of the Catholic faith, as taught by the Apo&s;tles and recognized in your country, before the church was connected with the civil govern|ment, and before the mini&s;ters of the altar became the tyrants of the &s;tate. The French con&s;titution has declared, that all men &s;hall be free to wor&s;hip God in their own way, and to follow the dictates of their con&s;cience. If any man &s;hall tell you that this is de&s;troying reli|gion, he is a liar, and not worthy to be your teacher. The go&s;pel of Je&s;us Chri&s;t preaches to you in the &s;tronge&s;t language the great doc|trine of equality; that all men are equal in the &s;ight of God, and that you &s;hall call no man your ma&s;ter upon earth. This is the very language of the French revolution. But its authors have gone farther; and, to &s;ilence all cavillers who could per&s;uade you or others that
<PB N="17" REF="028237_0017_0FD74424703B4A40">
they have de&s;troyed the Catholic religion, they have done more to maintain it than any le|gi&s;lative body ever did before; they have or|dained that the prie&s;ts and bi&s;hops, cho&s;en by the people &s;hall be &s;alaried and paid out of the national pur&s;e.</P>
<P>It is true, they have &s;uppre&s;&s;ed tho&s;e haunts of idlene&s;s, hypocri&s;y and vice, known by the name of mona&s;teries and convents. This is an advantage to religion, in&s;tead of being again&s;t it; for religion teaches men to do good, and to labour for their living; but the&s;e in&s;ti|tutions teach them to do nothing, and live upon the labours of others. Be a&s;&s;ured, there|fore, that the French have done nothing to the di&s;advantage of religion; but, on the contra|ry, they have done much to maintain it in its native purity and independence. But I in|treat you in the &s;incerity of my heart not to receive this fact on the &s;trength of my a&s;&s;er|tion, or that of any other man; but to look into their conduct and judge for your|&s;elves.</P>
<P>You have been likewi&s;e taught to believe that the French have violated private property. This is a malicious calumny, which every &s;tep of their revolution will contradict, the moment you become acquainted with it. In all the decrees of the National A&s;&s;embly, in all the irregular movements and in&s;urrections of the people, whatever was the object, you will find they have paid a mo&s;t &s;acred regard
<PB N="18" REF="028237_0018_0FD7442D337585E0">
to individual property. Their conduct in this re&s;pect has been more laudable within the la&s;t three years than that of any other government in Europe. The &s;ame thing may be ob&s;erved with regard to the private morals of the people; they are e&s;&s;entially better than they formerly were. There have been le&s;s in&s;tances of theft and robbery in France &s;ince the revolution, than at any former period; and probably le&s;s, in proportion to its popu|lation, than in any of the neighbouring coun|tries during the &s;ame period.</P>
<P>With regard to the National A&s;&s;embly, I will give you &s;ome in&s;tances of their inviola|ble principle of pre&s;erving the property of in|dividuals amid&s;t the &s;hock of the revolution. The abu&s;es of the ancient government had created thou&s;ands of u&s;ele&s;s offices in every department of &s;tate, in the <HI>law,</HI> the <HI>finance,</HI> and the <HI>king's hou&s;ehold,</HI>&mdash;the &s;ame as you &s;ee at Turin. The&s;e offices were &s;uppo&s;ed to have been purcha&s;ed and paid for by tho&s;e who held them; though many of them had been given gratis through favour and intrigue. On the regeneration of the government and of the nation by the revolution, it was nece&s;|&s;ary that the&s;e de&s;tructive &s;inecures &s;hould be &s;uppre&s;&s;ed; and the A&s;&s;embly, con&s;idering them as the property of the holders, purcha&s;|ed up this property and paid the proprietors the full prices that they had given, or were &s;uppo&s;ed to have given, for their places. This
<PB N="19" REF="028237_0019_0FD7442E9ECCE340">
act of ju&s;tice was certainly not nece&s;&s;ary to the revolution. It mu&s;t therefore be con&s;ider|ed as a mark of that national dignity which forbids the violation of any kind of private property, however &s;lender the title by which it is claimed.</P>
<P>Another in&s;tance may be ob&s;erved in the public debt. It is well known that the public debt of France, as well as that of Pied|mont, was contracted by a wicked and infamous court, the greater part of it for the wor&s;t of purpo&s;es. It was in part con|tracted to &s;upport the vices of a horde of men and women at Ver&s;ailles, who were a di&s;grace to human nature, and whom the nation was under no obligation to maintain; it was in part contracted to carry on foreign wars and conque&s;ts, the expre&s;s purpo&s;e of which was to rivet the chains of the people at home. But as the creditors in general were not to be blamed for the&s;e things, they were declared to be the proprietors of the debt; and the na|tion a&s;&s;umed upon it&s;elf the payment, without any diminution. This mu&s;t ever be remem|bered as an act of &s;overeign magnanimity and of di&s;intere&s;ted protection to the property of individuals; an act to which they were not con&s;trained by any nece&s;&s;ity or previous obli|gation. A royal bankruptcy might have been declared, without affecting the future credit of the nation; and the revolution would have &s;uffered no delay, but would have been faci|litated

by proceeding on this principle. In|&s;tead of doing this, the people have voluntarily taken an immen&s;e burden on them&s;elves, even under the humiliating circum&s;tance of giving a &s;anction to all the extravagance of the two la&s;t centuries, and paying at this day, under the rigid economy of a republic, for tho&s;e &s;plendid palaces, gardens, and water-works, which in&s;ult the poverty of millions, and &s;tare the nation in the face with the unpuni&s;hed crimes of a race of execrated kings.</P>
<P>The act of the a&s;&s;embly declaring the church lands to be the property of the nation, the &s;up|pre&s;&s;ion of tythes and other feudal claims, have been often mentioned as violations of property.

As to the church lands, this act of the A&s;&s;em|bly did not change the property of them at all. They belonged to the nation before. What the A&s;&s;embly did, was to change the mode of paying the clergy, equalize their &s;alaries, and reduce the number of eccle&s;ia&s;tics. That laborious and more u&s;eful cla&s;s of the clergy, who before were &s;tarving upon a beggarly pit|tance, have had their &s;alaries rai&s;ed; that idle and overgrown cla&s;s, who, without doing any duty, were living in the &s;tyle of princes and tyrants, have been reduced to a moderate in|come.

All are now cho&s;en by the people, and all paid by the nation. With regard to the feudal claims, they were founded in u&s;urpation. The landlords and nobles, to whom they were attributed, had no right to them or property in them, any more than the King of Sardinia has a property in you, or in the people of Jeru&s;alem, of which he likewi&s;e &s;tyles him&s;elf King. The&s;e feudal claims were mere badges of &s;er|vitude, which the e&s;tabli&s;hment of equal liber|ty and the abolition of hereditary titles render|ed it nece&s;&s;ary to de&s;troy. The nation has in all in&s;tances &s;howed it&s;elf able to di&s;tingui&s;h between the empty &s;uper&s;tition of pomp, which &s;erves only to deba&s;e mankind, and the &s;olid principles of &s;ociety on which the revolution is founded.</P>

All the cruelty, all the crimes of every name or denomination, that have attended this re|volution, have proceeded from royalty, the adherents of royalty, and the refractory prie&s;ts. The court of Ver&s;ailles had been for ages a &s;chool of fal&s;ehood and deceit; and the exe|cution of the penal laws &s;erved as a public ex|hibition of torture, to familiari&s;e the people

with the mo&s;t &s;anguinary puni&s;hments. If the court of Turin and the laws of Piedmont are any better, it is happier for you; you will have the le&s;s wickedne&s;s to combat in the cour&s;e of your revolution. But I fear in &s;ome re&s;pects they are wor&s;e. The&s;e circum&s;tances in France had trained up in all parts of the kingdom a numerous cla&s;s of men ver&s;ed in every art of treachery and perfidy. In this &s;itu|tion of things the great ma&s;s of the people, who are naturally hone&s;t and good, &s;et them|&s;elves &s;eriou&s;ly to work in the bu&s;ine&s;s of the revolution; which might have been carried on with the greate&s;t harmony; as it had nothing in view but the welfare of the whole. But the&s;e deceitful men, being enemies of the revolution, and finding that they could not oppo&s;e it by open force, a&s;&s;umed the ma&s;k of patrioti&s;m, and brought them&s;elves into places of tru&s;t in every department of the le|gi&s;lative and executive power. The effect of this was that the&s;e good people found them|&s;elves deceived and betrayed in every &s;tage of their affairs, from the beginning of the revo|lution in 1789, till the tenth of Augu&s;t, 1792. Being &s;urrounded by traitors, and not knowing whom to tru&s;t even with the exe|cution of their own vengeance, it was natural and &s;ometimes nece&s;&s;ary that they &s;hould a&s;|&s;ume this terrible ta&s;k upon them&s;elves.

the &s;ame. It is the cau&s;e of tyranny that has made them enemies; it is the impo&s;ition and fal&s;ehood of tho&s;e who would live on other men's labours, that have occa&s;ioned all the wars of every nation in the world. The people of Savoy were certainly under no obligation to be governed by the King of Jeru&s;alem; tho' they had groaned under his yoke for many generations. Their late conduct in declaring their own &s;overeignty and independence, aboli&s;hing hereditary titles, and e&s;tabli&s;hing a government of their own on the principles of equal liberty, is a &s;ubject which mu&s;t &s;trike your minds in a very intere&s;ting point of view. Your tyrants will repre&s;ent it as a crime which ought to excite your indignation; and they will call on you to take arms and ru&s;h headlong into a de&s;tructive war, to a&s;&s;i&s;t them in reducing this country again to their obe|dience. They are now preparing their forces, augmenting their armies, borrowing money abroad, and extorting it from the hand of in|du&s;try at home, for this dete&s;table purpo&s;e. You are to be taken from your farms and your &s;hops, and enrolled in the regiments of death. If you are unwilling to engage in this new kind of &s;lavery, you are to be &s;eized upon like &s;o many felons, dragged from your wives and children, and tortured into di&s;cipline un|der the la&s;h of a military officer.

<P><PB N="25" REF="028237_0025_0FD7445525CC8380">But before you &s;uffer your&s;elves to be dri|ven to this de&s;perate bu&s;ine&s;s, I intreat you to re&s;ort to your own rea&s;on, and exerci&s;e the right of judging for your&s;elves. Con&s;ider the nature of the enterpri&s;e, and the object you have in view. Who are the people on whom you are going to let fall this terrible &s;troke of vengeance? What is their crime? Are they not your brothers and friends? Have they not acted as you would have done in their &s;ituation? And ought you not rather at this moment to follow their example, than to be the in&s;truments of their de&s;truction and your own? Let us attend to this enquiry before it be too late.</P>
<P>The people of Savoy, as to their local po|&s;ition &s;tand in the &s;ame relation to France as you &s;tand in to Italy. They and you are po&s;t|ed in the marches of the&s;e two great fractions of the Continent. As long as this part of Europe is governed by tyrants, perpetually contending for dominion on each &s;ide of the Alps, the&s;e po&s;itions expo&s;e you both to the inroads of all parties. You cannot avoid be|ing in&s;ulted by foreign armies in their pa&s;&s;age through your country, although you have no intere&s;t in their quarrels. Your hi&s;tory is full of examples of this kind, from the days of Hannibal, down to that infamous war of the Spani&s;h &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, which involved your coun|try in blood and held half Europe in arms for many years together; a war in which you
<PB N="26" REF="028237_0026_0FD7445A667AD098">
had no other concern, than that of being the victims of foreign di&s;putes. The face of your country bears the in&s;ulting marks of this un|fortunate po&s;ition in which you are placed. It is covered with fortifications. As if na|ture had not thrown rocks and mountains enough in your way, you have been forced to create them by the hand of art, to encompa&s;s your towns with walls, and disfigure your fields with towers and ca&s;tles. Your agricul|ture has been ill-conducted, your manufac|tures neglected; all the u&s;eful arts have been forced to yield to a general &s;y&s;tem of defence again&s;t the enemies of your neighbours, when you had no enemies of your own.</P>
<P>In this &s;ituation, what is to be done? You cannot change the po&s;ition which nature has given to your country. Your only re&s;ource is to change the policy of Europe from war to peace. You are more peculiarly intere&s;ted in the perpetual peace of Europe than any other people on earth. This is a weighty con&s;ideration, a truth which your tyrants can|not deny. It is the knowledge of this truth which has influenced the people of Savoy in their late change of government. It is in this point of view that they have contemplated the French revolution; with this view they have adopted it them&s;elves, and wi&s;h to extend it to you, who&s;e &s;ituation &s;o nearly re&s;embles their own. With this view you ought to wi&s;h to extend it to all the States of Italy, to Spain,
<PB N="27" REF="028237_0027_0FD7445BA18B8E10">
and to the circles of the empire, from whence it would travel through Europe and through the world.</P>
<P>The principles of this revolution are tho&s;e of univer&s;al peace; and it is impo&s;&s;ible that it &s;hould fail to produce the effect, becau&s;e it takes away every motive for national ho&s;tility, and teaches the people of all countries to re|gard each other as friends and fellow-citizens of the world. E&s;tabli&s;h equal liberty among the people, and in&s;truct them in the duties that ari&s;e from that &s;ituation, as the French are about to do; you will then find that the bu&s;ine&s;s of tyrants has cea&s;ed, and the race is forever extinct. Purge the earth of its tyrants, and it will no more be tormented with war.</P>
<P>The conduct of the people of Savoy in uniting them&s;elves to the French republic de|&s;erves a farther con&s;ideration. This was a mea&s;ure incidental to their geographical po&s;i|tion on the French &s;ide of the Alps; and the arguments which induced them to it, do not apply to you. It is probable that for the pur|po&s;es of civil government you will hencefor|ward be two di&s;tinct people. But this &s;tep of their's cannot be con&s;idered by you as an act of ho&s;tility, or a breach of friend&s;hip. They are certainly not le&s;s your friends &s;ince they have cea&s;ed to be your fellow-&s;ubjects. It is an e&s;&s;ential quality of a French citizen to be the friend of all people, e&s;pecially of tho&s;e in
<PB N="28" REF="028237_0028_0FD7446021ACCDC8">
his neighbourhood, who&s;e peace and happine&s;s will always be nece&s;&s;ary to his own.</P>
<P>The e&s;&s;ence of tyranny is to counteract the economy of nature, the e&s;&s;ence of liberty is to promote it. Nature has &s;aid that the French and the Savoyards &s;hould be one people; but tyranny has &s;aid that the Savoyards and the Piedmonte&s;e &s;hould be one people. Con|&s;ult your hi&s;tory, and &s;ee what torrents of blood have been &s;hed to cement this unnatural union. Come and view the condition of this unfortunate people; po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing one of the fine&s;t countries in the world, and deprived of the means of improving it; &s;ubjected for ages to a race of weak and impolitic princes, who, fixing their re&s;idence on the other &s;ide of the Alps, have paid no other attention to this part of their dominions, than to keep the people in poverty and ignorance, in order to &s;ecure their obedience. A military force, &s;ent from your country, has been maintained here to in&s;ult the peaceable inhabitants, by exerci&s;|ing the police in every town and village. The Senate of Savoy, which was formerly a legi&s;lative body, has been long &s;ince reduced to the &s;imple functions of a judiciary tribunal, and its members appointed by the king. He has prevented the working of the mines of iron, lead and coals, with which the country abounds; he has prevented the e&s;tabli&s;hment of any one of the different manufactures to which the inhabitants are peculiarly invited

Though you hold the balance of great benefits and of great di&s;a&s;ters, which the pre&s;ent &s;tate of affairs is ready to offer to your country; though you are able by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of France to ri&s;e as one man and reclaim your own &s;overeignty, e&s;tabli&s;h your own liberty and provide for the future tranquility of this part of Europe; though by a contrary conduct you may fight the battles of your tyrant again&s;t the friends of your peace; yet remember, you cannot long im|pede the progre&s;s of liberty. Her cau&s;e is that of rea&s;on and of God; &s;he will not li&s;ten to any capitulation with de&s;poti&s;m; the mon&s;|ter mu&s;t be driven beyond the Adriatic, and bani&s;hed from the face of the earth. Italy mu&s;t be free; &s;he cannot wear her chains much longer; it would be glorious for you to
<PB N="35" REF="028237_0035_0FD74478EE57F3E0">
be the fir&s;t in this regeneration of &s;ociety in that ancient garden of the world. Such a mea&s;ure would be an example of virtue to your children, a con&s;olation to the &s;hades of your ance&s;tors, who for a long &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of ages have pa&s;&s;ed away in the clouds of preju|dice, without knowing the means of happi|ne&s;s, or perceiving the dignity of man.</P>
<P>Your king has joined the coalition of de&s;|pots again&s;t the people of all nations. Their arms are directed again&s;t France; but their ho&s;tility is really again&s;t their own &s;ubjects. What cau&s;e of quarrel had the King of Hun|gary, or the Elector of Brandenburg with the people of France? None. Their jealou&s;y was again&s;t the people of Hungary, of Au&s;|tria, of Brabant, and of Brandenburg. They &s;aw that the&s;e nations were about to reclaim the rights of man and to ca&s;t off the yoke of oppre&s;&s;ion, as the French had done. They, therefore, to retain their unju&s;t power at home, concluded that it was be&s;t to &s;trike the revolution at its root, and conquer Germany in France. They knew, if they could &s;ub|due the French, and completely vanqui&s;h the &s;pirit of liberty in that country, that all the people of Europe would &s;hrink beneath their chains, and their ma&s;ters might probably &s;leep upon their thrones for another half cen|tury.</P>
<P>Such was the policy of your ma&s;ter. You cannot &s;uppo&s;e that, as King of Jeru&s;alem or
<PB N="36" REF="028237_0036_0FD7447B24A414C8">
Prince of Peidmont, he had any ground or colour of di&s;pute with the French nation. That nation had no concern with him, nor with any part of his dominions. They were occupied in their own affairs, at peace with all the world, and declared that they meant to remain &s;o. He entered into the war with them for no other purpo&s;e but to keep you in &s;ubjection. The war was again&s;t you, and is &s;till to be carried on again&s;t you the next cam|paign. He intends to make you his &s;oldiers to fight his own battles again&s;t your&s;elves, al|though he orders you to point your cannon again&s;t the French.</P>
<P>This is the true &s;tate of the ca&s;e. The whole of this war on the part of your mo|narch is maintained by deceiving you. Indeed the whole bu&s;ine&s;s of monarchy is deception; kings mu&s;t govern by deception, as long as they govern at all; for it is impo&s;&s;ible for one man to tyranni&s;e over a whole people, but by deceiving them. I have no particular di&s;|like to your king, any more than to all others; he is probably no wor&s;e than kings in general. They hold an office that is perfectly u&s;ele&s;s in &s;ociety, and exceedingly de&s;tructive to the peace and happine&s;s of mankind. In this view they ought to be dete&s;ted by every man, and rejected by every nation.</P>
<P>France has been forced into the field, to encounter this infamous combination of rob|bers, this war of all crimes again&s;t the prin|ciples
<PB N="37" REF="028237_0037_0FD7447F72D5A048">
of all virtue. She has undertaken the defence of human nature. She has a&s;&s;umed a new kind of tactique unknown to the art of war, and irre&s;i&s;tible to the armies of kings. She has armed her&s;elf in the panoply of rea|&s;on; her manife&s;to is the rights of man, her &s;word the pledge of peace. In this &s;pecies of warfare we need not be a&s;toni&s;hed at her &s;uc|ce&s;s. What people can re&s;i&s;t the hand that comes to break their chains? The armies of liberty are every where triumphant, while their &s;tandards are &s;carcely &s;tained with blood. Victory completes her work, before they ar|rive to celebrate the conque&s;t; and the en|trance of the French troops into the conquer|ed country is regarded by the people rather as the proce&s;&s;ion of a civic fea&s;t, than as the dreaded violence of war. Their general, in|&s;tead of puni&s;hing the new recovered citizens with confi&s;cation, impri&s;onment, and death, meets them in their Jacobin &s;ocieties, and in|vites them to form their primary a&s;&s;emblies. The forts and garri&s;ons which he erects to &s;e|cure his conque&s;ts, are printing pre&s;&s;es and reading clubs.</P>
<P>Such is the war in which the illu&s;trious monarch of Turin is engaged. The&s;e are the armies he expects you to encounter in the field. If you wi&s;h to know in what manner the combat ought to be conducted, you may learn it from the people of Savoy, who&s;e ex|ample in this re&s;pect, as in many others, is
<PB N="38" REF="028237_0038_0FD7448164EFCB98">
worthy to be followed by every nation. You may learn it likewi&s;e from the people of Nice, from tho&s;e of Hainault, Flanders, Brabant, Ma|lines, Antwerp, Guelderland, Namur Liege, Spires, and Mayenee; all provinces, princi|palities, or independent &s;tates, conquered to liberty within the la&s;t three months. As I have kept no complete regi&s;ter of the&s;e con|que&s;ts, perhaps the above li&s;t may be incom|plete. But it matters not; if it were com|plete for to day, perhaps it would not be &s;o for to-morrow. This advice is intended for the in&s;truction of the people; if your king &s;hould deem it incon&s;i&s;tent with his warlike character to follow the &s;ame advice, he can take a le&s;&s;on from the battle of Gemmappe.</P>
<P>The French army de&s;tined for your deliver|ance will probably not pa&s;s the Alps till the &s;pring. You have the remainder of the win|ter to deliberate on the part you have to act. You can by that time decide whether you will receive them as enemies or as friends.&mdash; In the latter ca&s;e, you have only to &s;tudy the principles of republican government, &s;end away your tyrants, and prepare your&s;elves to give le&s;&s;ons of liberty to all the Italian States. The troops of Au&s;tria, which are now about to enter your territories from Milan and Tu&s;|cany, under pretence of aiding you again&s;t the French, will flee before them, as they have done in the Low Countries, the moment you
<PB N="39" REF="028237_0039_0FD744899B4C1538">
manife&s;t your intention of doing your own bu|&s;ine&s;s in a peaceable way.</P>
<P>But, after a due con&s;ideration of the circum|&s;tances which I have endeavoured to detail, &s;hould you conclude to regard the French peo|ple as your enemies, and to meet their armies in the field, I &s;hall tremble for the con&s;e|quences of your unfortunate deci&s;ion. Thou|&s;ands among you mu&s;t fall the victims of the infamous cau&s;e of your tyrant, which can|not be &s;upported. On that day, I beg you would call to mind the hone&s;t advice of a &s;tran|ger, who now &s;peaks to you the words of truth; who has been a &s;teady ob&s;erver of the ri&s;e and progre&s;s of liberty in America and in France; and, who, from the&s;e advantages is able to e&s;timate the force of its principles, and predict the triumph of its arms.</P>
<P>I advi&s;e you above all things to be cautious of the troops in the pay of Au&s;tria, who are marching to join your army. You cannot be &s;o blinded by your leaders as to &s;uppo&s;e that this band of ruffiians is brought into your country to render &s;ervice to you. They are de&s;igned to keep you in &s;ubjection, and to take from you the freedom of your choice in the great que&s;tion, Whether you will adopt the principles of the French revolution? They will be po&s;ted in your rear, to act again&s;t you, if you &s;hould refu&s;e to act again&s;t the French. Your po&s;ition may &s;eem a critical one, placed in the interval between two contending pow|ers;
<PB N="40" REF="028237_0040_0FD74493B69D1440">
but, remember that one is an army of freemen, the other a horde of &s;laves; on one &s;ide is the permanent force of a nation, who&s;e means are inexhau&s;tible, on the other the accidental hireling of a de&s;pot who&s;e &s;ceptre is falling from his hands; from one you have the offer of equal liberty and perpetual peace, from the other a continuance of your &s;lavery, augmentation of your burthens, and a cer|tainty of future wars.</P>
<P>Italy is de&s;tined to form one great republic. The boundaries which nature has given it are peculiarly &s;uited to this purpo&s;e; and as long as we follow nature, in politics as well as morals, we are &s;ure to be in the right. Politicians, who have not well con&s;i|dered the effects of liberty, are alarmed at the extention of the French republic, fearing it will become too powerful for its neighbours. For this rea&s;on the union of Savoy is men|tioned as a &s;ubject of jealou&s;y to other nations. The enemies of your liberty will not fail to make u&s;e of this circum&s;tance to excite your fears and provoke your re&s;entment. Men who rea&s;on in this manner have formed their max|ims on tho&s;e de&s;potic &s;y&s;tems of government to which they have been accu&s;tomed. They are maxims which can no longer apply to na|tions, when ma&s;ters of their own actions, and at liberty to govern them&s;elves by the collected wi&s;dom of the great body of the people. A nation in this condition will never di&s;turb the
<PB N="41" REF="028237_0041_0FD74498B13F5490">
peace of its neighbours in any manner what|ever. Its intere&s;t, on the contrary, will be to promote the peace and pro&s;perity of every country in the world.</P>
<P>When a nation is governed by one man, like Piedmont, or by a few families, like the ancient ari&s;tocracy of Rome, and &s;everal mo|dern ones in Italy, the intere&s;t of tho&s;e who govern, is to extend their dominions; becau&s;e it augments their per&s;onal revenue and adds to the weight of their influence over the peo|ple, whom they con&s;ider as their property.&mdash; For this rea&s;on they make war; for this rea|&s;on they form treaties of alliance to guaran|tee each other in their conque&s;ts, and in the property which they have in the people.&mdash; In pur&s;uance of this policy, the Prince of Piedmont, in the cour&s;e of that long Spani&s;h war which I have mentioned, purcha&s;ed with the blood and trea&s;ure of your nation, the title of King of Sardinia; and at the clo&s;e of the war, he obtained from the Hou&s;es of Au&s;tria and Bourbon, and from the King of England, a guarantee of the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>It is ea&s;y to conceive that a &s;y&s;tem of rob|bery and murder of this kind, carried on thro' all Europe for centuries together, mu&s;t be re|duced to &s;ome certain rules. The&s;e rules by a mi&s;application of terms, are called the <HI>law of nations.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>We may hope &s;oon to &s;ee the</HI> law of nations <HI>e&s;ta|bli&s;hed on different principles; that is, on principles as different from what it has been, as the intere&s;t of nations is different from that of tho&s;e per&s;ons who have u&s;ually governed them.</HI></NOTE> It is rather the law of de&s;pots,
<PB N="42" REF="028237_0042_0FD7449A63029DB0">
who know no law but their own fears. It has likewi&s;e been nece&s;&s;ary to e&s;tabli&s;h &s;ome general ideas of what is called the <HI>balance of power</HI> among the &s;tates of Europe, requiring that each &s;tate &s;hould be re&s;trained to certain fixed limits. On this principle, when any particular power endeavours to extend its limits, it is natural to tax that power with ambitious views, and to regard it as an object of jealou&s;y. This rea&s;oning is perfectly ju&s;t when applied to regal and ari&s;tocratical do|minions; but under the reign of liberty the argument has lo&s;t its ground; dominion it&s;elf is at an end; all the technical terms in the &s;cience of politics have changed their mean|ing; and as we mu&s;t begin the &s;cience anew, it is to be regretted that we are not furni&s;hed with new words, to expre&s;s our ideas with more preci&s;ion than we can with the old.</P>
<P>If all the nations of Europe were as free as the French, and every individual member of &s;ociety were equally independent of every other individual, the que&s;tion re&s;pecting the boundaries of any particular government would become in a great mea&s;ure indifferent, both to the people of that government and to all their neighbours. No per&s;on would have any intere&s;t in extending or contracting the
<PB N="43" REF="028237_0043_0FD7449CDF0C97D8">
territorial limits of a &s;tate. They would be e&s;tabli&s;hed purely on the principle of conven|ience for the admini&s;tration of the interior concerns of the people, and by the free con|&s;ent of all parties. And whenever it &s;hould be found more convenient to change them, they might be extended or contracted on the &s;ame principle, without injury to any per&s;on, and without exciting the jealou&s;y of any na|tion.</P>
<P>I could cite you many in&s;tances from the United States of America, in which this theo|ry has been carried into practice; which would prove to you that the doctrine I here advance, as one of the effects of liberty, is not chimerical. But an in&s;tance more &s;triking to you, and which will form an epoch in the hi&s;|tory of Europe, is the conduct of the Nation|al Convention of France on the propo&s;ition of Savoy to be united to that republic. Here we &s;ee a &s;overeign people, uninfluenced by any fears, hopes, or connections from abroad, deliberating in the mo&s;t &s;olemn manner, whether they will extend their territorial boundaries, by the admi&s;&s;ion of &s;even new provinces, inhabited by four hundred thou|&s;and freemen who had &s;ent their deputies to &s;olicit an union. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>The &s;even provinces which formed the Duchy of Savoy, now united to France, under the name of the department of</HI> Mont Blanc, <HI>were Savoy proper, Genevois, Carouge, Chablois, Fauchigny, Tarentai&s;e, and Maurienne.</HI></NOTE> To rai&s;e a que&s;tion on a
<PB N="44" REF="028237_0044_0FD7449F23BD2B80">
propo&s;ition of this kind is certainly a new thing in politics. Louis XIV. would have carried on a war for half a century, and &s;acra|ficed twice that number of his own &s;ubjects, to have made &s;uch an acqui&s;ition to his do|minions. But the members of the Convention who deliberated on this que&s;tion had no per|&s;onal intere&s;t to &s;erve, no ambition to gratify. It was merely a que&s;tion of national conveni|ence, whether the frontiers of the republic &s;hould remain fixed on the limits of Dauphiny and Lyonnois, or be extended to the Alps which appear to be the natural boundary of France.</P>
<P>The latter opinion prevailed; but it was rather on account of the pre&s;ent circum&s;tances of Italy than of France. Italy is &s;till govern|ed by de&s;pots; and it is to be expected, that as long as they remain in power, they will con|tinue the war they have undertaken again&s;t the French. To prevent their incur&s;ions, it was nece&s;&s;ary to oppo&s;e them the barrier of the Alps. But if Italy were as free as France, all cau&s;es of ho&s;tility between them would be for ever removed. It would be &s;carcely po&s;|&s;ible in the cour&s;e of human events, that they would ever more have any ground of conten|tion. In that ca&s;e it would be perfectly in|different, as to per&s;onal intere&s;t, both to the French and the Savoyards, whether they &s;hould form one people, or two, or ten.&mdash; And whatever re&s;olution they &s;hould take, as
<PB N="45" REF="028237_0045_0FD744A1CED7A308" MS="y">
mo&s;t convenient to them&s;elves, would never excite your jealou&s;y or re&s;entment.</P>
<P>No people has more to gain by this pacific &s;y&s;tem than tho&s;e of Piedmont. You inhabit a fertile country, productive of all the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary articles of life; &s;everal of which are in great demand among your neighbours. All that is wanting to render you happy is to be ma&s;ters of the fruits of your own labours at home, to be &s;ecured again&s;t war, and to have a free circulation of the objects of commerce.</P>
<P>The&s;e three things are now within your reach; they would follow as a nece&s;&s;ary con|&s;equence of adopting the principles of the French revolution, and e&s;tabli&s;hing the liber|ties of Italy.</P>
<P>With the mo&s;t ardent wi&s;hes to render you &s;ervice, in the pre&s;ent &s;olemn cri&s;is of your af|fairs, I have written you this letter. If it &s;hould an&s;wer no other purpo&s;e, it will at lea&s;t &s;erve as a te&s;timony to my con&s;cience, that I have endeavoured to do my duty, and to me|rit the title which I claim, that of your &s;incere and di&s;intere&s;ted friend,</P>
