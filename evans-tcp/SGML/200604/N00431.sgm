<HI>Day is this Scripture fulfilled in your Ears.</HI> It is by an unhappy Encounter of <HI>Gods Mercies</HI> and <HI>your Desires,</HI> that upon the Reading of the <HI>Text</HI> now before us, I may in like manner, <HI>close the Book,</HI> and say, <HI>This day is this Text fulfilled amongst us.</HI> Truly tis <HI>known</HI> abroad, that our God <HI>has done excel|lent things;</HI> and for this cause we are with no less <HI>Grounded</HI> than <HI>Solemn</HI> THNKSGIVINGS endeavouring to <HI>Sing unto the Lord.</HI> Behold a <HI>Word of the day in its day</HI> here provided for you!

<P>As the Noble Prophet <HI>Is<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">iah,</HI> is in the <HI>Books</HI> of the <HI>New-Testament</HI> quoted perhaps no less than threescore times; thu the <HI>Dayes</HI> of the <HI>New-Testament</HI> are those which his Prophecies have their frequent and special References to.</P>

of the great <HI>Luther,</HI> we may at this day make the <HI>Anodyne</HI> of our cares: we have two in|spired <HI>Songs</HI> in this Chapter laid before us<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> in the first of the <HI>Songs,</HI> the <HI>Confessors</HI> of God endeavour <HI>thmeselves</HI> to celebrate the Praises of that Eternal one; in the next they en|deavour to excite and engage <HI>others</HI> unto a consort with them in this glorious Exercise. And here we have the <HI>Text</HI> which we are now to descant upon. <HI>[In that Day ye shall say]</HI> But <HI>What</HI> day is <HI>That</HI> day? we must be beholden unto the foregoing Chapter, for an Answer thereunto. We there find, that there will a <HI>Day</HI> come, when the <HI>Lord will set His Hand again the second time, to recover the remnant of his People:</HI> which will be when the Tribes of lost <HI>Israel</HI> are converted unto the Faith of the Lord Jesus; when according to the Language of the <HI>New-Testament,</HI> All <HI>Israel shall be saved.</HI> There will a Day come, <HI>when the Root of Jesse shall stand for an Ensign for the People:</HI> which will be at the <HI>second coming</HI> of our Lord; when according to the phrase taken by our Saviour from this very place, <HI>the sign of the Son of man shall ap|pear.</HI> There will a Day come, <HI>when the Lord shall with the Breath of His Lips, slay the wicked;</HI> which will be when <HI>Antichrist</HI> shall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">erish by the fiery approach of the Lord Jesus, to take vengeance on His wickedest

Enemy: when according to the phrase taken by the Apostle also from this very place <HI>The Lord shall consume that wicked one with the breath of his mouth, and shall destroy, him with the brightness of his coming.</HI></P>
<P>Tis <HI>that day</HI> which the <HI>Song</HI> now before us, is peculiarly calculated for. But certainly, we that are only getting into the D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">wnings of <HI>that day,</HI> are not excluded from all medling with it; no, <HI>it is written for our Admoni|tion.</HI></P>
<P>In the Words to be now Handled, we have two Things.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> The <HI>Doings</HI> of God are here men|tioned. <HI>I</HI>t is said, <HI>He hath done Excellent Things:</HI> or as the Original imports, <HI>Great Things,</HI> and <HI>High Things:</HI> or as it may likewise be rendred <HI>Magnificent,</HI> and <HI>Illustrious Things.</HI> The <HI>Hebrew</HI> Word (<GAP DESC="foreign">) is indeed a Substantive; and it intimates, that the <HI>Works</HI> of God are even <HI>Excellency</HI> in the Abstract, and <HI>Majesty</HI> it self. And the <HI>Chaldee</HI> Paraphrase here fitly puts upon them the term of <GAP DESC="foreign"> of <HI>Magnali<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> noting in them something eminent and po|werful. Such things are done by Him, who is <HI>Wonderful</HI> in <HI>Working!</HI></P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> The <HI>Duties</HI> of men are then spe|cified hereupon. Since excellent <HI>Things</HI> are done by <HI>God,</HI> there are two things to be done by us.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="000540_0013_0FA6B5B336C8CF90">
<HI>First,</HI> We are to <HI>sing</HI> the Praises of God. It is here said, <HI>Sing unto the Lord.</HI> And such is the expression in the Holy style, as to sig|nifie, not only an <HI>exactness,</HI> but also an <HI>in|strument</HI> used in the <HI>Song.</HI> We are with a <HI>Sacred Musick</HI> to magnifie the God, who is <HI>worthy to be Praised.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> We are to <HI>spread</HI> the Praises of God. It is here said, <HI>This is known in all the Earth;</HI> but the version which is by some chosen for it rather is, <HI>Let this be known is all the Earth:</HI> We should not only our selves do it, but likewise provoke and excite <HI>all the Earth</HI> to take notice of what <HI>Wonders</HI> have been done by Him who is <HI>fearful in Prai|ses.</HI></P>
<P>Wherefore the Truth to be now en|tertained with us, is,</P>
<P><HI>Chat it should be our study to SING and SPREAD the Praises due to the Eternal God, for the EXCELLENT Things which are done by him in the World.</HI></P>
<P>It is by the Propounding of two or three, Conclusions that this <HI>Doctrine,</HI> will have its due Advantages.</P>

<HEAD>PROPOSITION I.</HEAD>
<P>There are multitudes of <HI>Praises</HI> due to the God the Heaven from us. To <HI>praise</HI> God, is to <HI>Acknowledge</HI> the perfections that are in Him; 'tis to <HI>Acknowledge</HI> the infinite Power, Wisdom, Goodness, Justice and Holiness, which are His Attributes; and this we are to do, <HI>In all our ways.</HI> We have received our Being for this End; and our Grand, our Chief Errand into the World, is, That our God may have a Number of <HI>Rational Be|holders</HI> to be sensible of His <HI>Excellencies.</HI> When Mankind came first out of His Glo|rious Hand, He then said, as in Isa. 43. 21. <HI>This people have I formed for my self, they shall shew forth my praise.</HI> In our Lower Little World, no Creatures can be found capable of Conceiving and Expressing those Ac|knowledgments of God, which are, <HI>The Glory due unto his Name,</HI> besides MAN; who is therefore not unfitly called, <HI>The High|priest of the Creation.</HI> The devout psalmist once called upon all Creatures, with a Repeated Invitation, <HI>Praise ye the Lord;</HI> but they all reply that <HI>Man</HI> is to do it for them, and they all therefore conspire to offer the Notices of the Almighty God, unto <HI>Mans</HI> affectionate Contemplation.</P>
<P><PB REF="000540_0015_0FA6B5B420162838">
To <HI>praise</HI> God, is to Acknowledge in Him something <HI>Excellent,</HI> as 'tis said in Psal. 148. 13. <HI>Let them praise the name of the Lord, for His Name alone is Excellent;</HI> thus, when we Acknowledge an <HI>Excellency</HI> in all those Ma|nifestations which God maketh of Himself; then 'tis that we <HI>praise</HI> Him. Now the <HI>Praises</HI> owing to the God of Heaven from us are ob|liged not only by what He <HI>Is,</HI> but also by what <HI>He Does:</HI> indeed by what <HI>He Does</HI> it is that we come to Learn what <HI>He is.</HI> We ought to Acknowledge an <HI>Excellency</HI> in the <HI>Nature</HI> of God; which is to Ascribe <HI>Glory</HI> to Him.

We are told in Isa. 28. 29. <HI>The lord of Hosts is Excellent in Working.</HI> Our <HI>praises</HI> of God, are in This to find the <HI>Reasons</HI> of them, <HI>He has done Excellent Things.</HI></P>
<P>First, We ought with many <HI>praises</HI> to ob|serve the <HI>Excellent Things</HI> which God has done for <HI>our selves.</HI> As the Psalmist call'd upon himself, in Psal. 103. 1. <HI>Bless the Lord, O my soul; and forget not all his Benefits;</HI> thus ought we to Reflect upon the many <HI>Benefits</HI> and <HI>Kindnesses</HI> of the most High towards our selves, with <HI>praises</HI> too many to be Numbred, too Hearty to be ended. We ought to see something of God, in all our Circumstances, and upon all that happens to us, we are to say, <HI>The Lord be magnify'd!</HI> But there are some <HI>Excellent Things</HI> done for us,
<PB N="9" REF="000540_0017_0FA6B5B6F7165738">
by our God; Things which no Friend, no Hand, <HI>none else</HI> could have done for our Good; and <HI>These</HI> Things we should with suitable <HI>praises</HI> be particularly grateful for. It is the manner of the <HI>Jews,</HI> to receive the Comforts of their Lives, with a <HI>Baruk Ado|nai,</HI> or <HI>Blessed be the Lord.</HI> We that are <HI>Christians</HI> may not suffer our selves to be ex|ceeded by any people, in <HI>Thankfulness</HI> un|to God.

Those persons are worse than Pharisees, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">n whose mouths, <HI>God be Thanked,</HI> is not a frequent but yet solemn Interjection.</P>
<P>Secondly, We ought with many <HI>praises</HI> to observe the <HI>Excellent Things</HI> which God has done for <HI>Others</HI> as well as for our selves. Our
<PB N="10" REF="000540_0018_0FA6B5B875DA4CF8">
<HI>praises</HI> must not be confined unto those <HI>mer|cies</HI> of God, which we our selves have been the Subjects of. But all His <HI>Dispensations</HI> a|broad in the world, are to be the Occasion of our <HI>Halleluj<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">bs</HI> to Him. A Soul that is <HI>Fill'd with all the Fullness of God,</HI> will be <HI>Fil|led</HI> with <HI>praises</HI> to Him for <HI>all</HI> his Workman|ship. We should be like him that said, in Psal 139. 14. <HI>I will praise thee, for marvel|lous are thy Works.</HI> Whatever our God is <HI>Doing,</HI> we should upon the sight thereof be <HI>praising;</HI> and we should Acknowledge Him, in all those <HI>Excellent Things,</HI> which we see done in any part of the Universe. It was said in Psal. 40. 5. <HI>Many, O Lord, my God, are the Wonderful Works which thou hast done.</HI> God has done many <HI>Wonderful Works,</HI> and many <HI>Excellent Things,</HI> in which we our selves have not an <HI>Immediate,</HI> or at least not a <HI>peculiar</HI> share; but we should all render <HI>praises</HI> unto Him on the account thereof. It is mentioned as the priviledge of a Righte|ous man, in Psal. 112. 9. <HI>His Horn shall be exalted.</HI> What if one thing intended in it should be This? That as the <HI>praises</HI> of God were sounded by His People, in <HI>Cornets</HI> of old, so there were <HI>Exalted Horns,</HI> or <HI>Exalted Notes,</HI> which He would have their <HI>praises</HI> to be Raised with.

<HEAD>PROPOSITION II.</HEAD>
<P>We ought both to <HI>Sing,</HI> and to <HI>Spread,</HI> the <HI>praises</HI> which we owe unto the God of Hea|ven. Behold, a double Office incumbent on us, with respect unto those <HI>Acknowledgments</HI> which we are to pay unto our God; beside and beyond the first <HI>Motions</HI> of them, in our own Souls. Indeed the <HI>Spring</HI> of all the <HI>Acknowledgments</HI> which we make unto God, must be in our Hearts, and the gracious <HI>Opi|nions</HI> and <HI>Resentmen's</HI> which are first formed there. We must <HI>first</HI> look to this, that God be <HI>praised</HI> by the Thoughts in our <HI>minds,</HI> and, as the Psalmist speaks, by, <HI>All that is within us Blessing his Holy Name.</HI> They ne|ver will <HI>praise</HI> God sufficiently or acceptably, who cannot say, as in Luke 1, 46. <HI>My Soul
<PB N="12" REF="000540_0020_0FA6B5BBE9DF3148">
does, Magnify the Lord.</HI> As all <HI>worship</HI> of God, so particularly, all <HI>praising</HI> of God, must be performed in <HI>Spirit;</HI> otherwise it will not be in <HI>Truth.</HI> But the <HI>praises</HI> of God, being shaped in the Honourable Thoughts of our Souls, what are we then to do?</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> We are to <HI>Sing</HI> the <HI>praises</HI> due to God for the <HI>Excellent Things</HI> that He hath done. And if we keep close to the Text, we shall see two things here demanded of us.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> There should be an <HI>Exactness</HI> used; in our <HI>praising</HI> of God. There should be in our <HI>Praises,</HI> as on one side an <HI>Amputation</HI> of all that is improper, so on the other side no <HI>Omission</HI> of any Article that calls for out me|ditations. The charge given to us it That in Psal. 103. 2. <HI>Forget not all His Benefits.</HI> We should not <HI>Forget</HI> so much as <HI>One</HI> of the <HI>Ex|cellent Things,</HI> which we can Remember to be done by God. The skipping of <HI>One stroke</HI> in a Lesson, often spoils the grace of the Musick. So does the missing of <HI>One Thing,</HI> in a Commemoration of what God has done. We should be careful with an often, yea with a daily <HI>Examination,</HI> to in|form our selves, about the Things for which God is to be <HI>praised.</HI> It is hardly convenient for a man to sleep at Night, until he have pondered, <HI>What New Excellent Things has been done by God this Day, that I should particularly
<PB N="13" REF="000540_0021_0FA6B5BC44F499B8">
praise Him for?</HI> And we should be careful that our <HI>Sorrows</HI> do not swallow up our <HI>prai|ses.</HI> 'Tis often so, that as that worthy wo|man of old could not eat of the <HI>Peace Of|fering,</HI> which was a <HI>Thank-Offering,</HI> because <HI>She Wept;</HI> thus we can't <HI>praise</HI> God, because He <HI>Smiles</HI> us. We cannot see <HI>Excellent Things</HI> done by God, because we feel <HI>Terrible Things</HI> done to our selves. But this is our <HI>Folly.</HI></P>
<P>Where we have <HI>One</HI> Trouble, we have a <HI>Thousand</HI> mercies of our own to be <HI>praising</HI> for. And if we were a million times more afflicted, than we are, yet the Lord might challenge our <HI>Praises.</HI> It was a great Speech of the Renowned <HI>G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">rson, Quiequid de me or|dinaverit</HI> Deus, said He, <HI>However God may dispose of me for ever, whether to Eternal Weal or Wo; yet This I know, that He is worthy of my praises, and He shall have them all.</HI> Indeed <HI>Praises</HI> are a Debt owing to Him, even from those woful Spirits that are <HI>broken in the place of Dragons, and covered with the shadow of Death.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> There should also be an <HI>Instru|ment</HI> used in our <HI>Praising</HI> of God. But of what kind? Far be it from us to plead for that which is properly <HI>instrumental Music</HI> in the Church of the Lord Jesus. Indeed be|fore the coming of our Lord, there was in the Church a Divine appointment for such a thing; and between the <HI>Neginoth</HI> and the
<PB N="14" REF="000540_0022_0FA6B5BD079F5EC8">
<HI>Nehiloth,</HI> I find, if I miscount not, sixteen or more kinds of <HI>Instruments</HI> for the main|taining of it. But upon the Abolition of the <HI>Mosaic Pedagogy,</HI> we have uo order-for the continuance of this <HI>Temple Worship,</HI> by intro|ducing of it into our <HI>Synagogues.</HI> The Primi|tive Church had it not, as even a <HI>Bellarmine</HI> tells you; the Ancients often &amp; loudly declaim against it, and <HI>Aquinas</HI> himself about four hun|dred years ago, notwithstanding all his Po|pery and Bigottry, yet bestows none of the kindest Remarks upon it. The <HI>Schoolmen</HI> themselves own, that <HI>Aliquid Figurabat,</HI> it was a <HI>Typical thing;</HI> and we having in the Tydings of the Gospel that <HI>grace</HI> and <HI>joy</HI> which this was a figure of, ought not to <HI>Judaize</HI> by upholding the shadow in the presence of the <HI>Substance;</HI> nor ought we to bring into the House of God, a Troop of Of|ficers which the Lord Jesus never instituted. What Instruments are we then to <HI>praise</HI> God withal? we are all furnished with <HI>two</HI> at least.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> Our <HI>Lips</HI> are to be employed in the <HI>praises</HI> of God. The Psalmist called his Tongue <HI>my glory.</HI> Our <HI>Tongues</HI> are then our <HI>glory,</HI> when we <HI>glorifie</HI> God therewith all. 'Tis a proper service for them; Hence the Apostle sayes, <HI>Therewith we bless God.</HI> It is <HI>Desired</HI> for the Saints in <HI>Psal.</HI> 149.6. <HI>let
<PB N="15" REF="000540_0023_0FAB5BDB8181B80">
the High Praises of God be in their mouthes.</HI> And it is Resolved by one of them, in <HI>Psal.</HI> 145.21. <HI>My mouth shall speak the praises of the Lord.</HI> Hence the Apostle urges it, in <HI>Heb.</HI> 13.15. <HI>let us offer the Sacrifice of praises to God continually, that is the fruit of our lips.</HI> There were Offerings of many sorts, which God was <HI>praised</HI> withal of old; but <HI>our Lips</HI> are to be instead of the <HI>Calves</HI> and <HI>Lambs,</HI> and other <HI>Euchr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">tical</HI> Offerings that then were customary.</P>
<P>With our Lips we are to rehearse and re|cite the <HI>Excellent Things</HI> that have been done by God, especially when we are with bended <HI>Knees</HI> and lifted <HI>Eyes,</HI> presenting our selves before him. With <HI>mentioning</HI> what God has done, we are to do as he said, in <HI>Psal.</HI> 145.2. <HI>Every Day will I bless thee my God.</HI></P>
<P>But there is one Exercise of our <HI>Lips,</HI> which God is more peculiarly to be <HI>praised</HI> with; and that is <HI>the Singing of Psalms.</HI> In those <HI>Commands</HI> of God which require the <HI>praises</HI> of God, even in our Dayes, we have such clauses as those, in <HI>Psal.</HI> 95 1. <HI>O come, let us sing to the Lord, let us make a joyful noise to the Rock of our Salvation.</HI> The New-Testament sufficiently inculcates this way of <HI>praising</HI> the most High; and if you will be|lieve <HI>Tertullian,</HI> the Primitive Christians
<PB N="16" REF="000540_0024_0FA6B5BFCF754A68">
hardly ever had a <HI>Feast</HI> without it. There are savoury <HI>Hymns,</HI> of an Humane Compo|sure, which no doubt we may <HI>praise</HI> God by singing of. But <HI>Scriptural</HI> and <HI>inspired</HI> Hymns are those which we should principally thus put Regards upon. <HI>The Psalms of David</HI> are those which <HI>God</HI> is to be <HI>Praised</HI> by a Reverent, and Attentive <HI>Singing</HI> of. <HI>These</HI> were those, no doubt which our Savio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">. Himself Sang, at the <HI>Passover,</HI> more than a score of Times, And the very <HI>Angels</HI> whose Melodies the <HI>Shepherds</HI> overheard of old, seem to sing out of the <HI>Eighty fifth Psalm.</HI> Hence when the Apostle says, in Eph. 5. 19. <HI>Speak to your selves in Psalms and Hymns, and Spiritual Songs;</HI> he alludes to the well-known Division of the <HI>Psalter. q. d.</HI> Go sing all the Psalms of <HI>David</HI> o|ver. Till we can <HI>mend</HI> them, never let us, leave them. He that shall <HI>sing</HI> those Blessed Psalms, and ordinarily spend at least one <HI>Observation,</HI> and one <HI>Ejaculation,</HI> upon every verse, as he goes along, will therein <HI>praise</HI> the great God, at no common rate.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Our L<HI>ives</HI> are likewise to be Employ'd in the <HI>Praises</HI> of God. We have <HI>Hands</HI> as well as <HI>Tongues</HI> for it; and some|thing there is that <HI>our Hand finds to do.</HI> The best <HI>Thanksgiving</HI> is <HI>Thanks living.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="000540_0025_0FA6B5BFF7CE4140">
We should sometimes put that Question to our selves, in <HI>Psal.</HI> 116:12. <HI>What shall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">render to the Lord for all His benefits?</HI> As a return to God for the <HI>Excellent things</HI> that are done by Him, we are to order our <HI>lives</HI> in such a manner as may be pleasing to him. Hence in <HI>Psal.</HI> 50.23. He that <HI>offers praise,</HI> and he that <HI>orders his conversation aright,</HI> are equiv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">|lent.</P>
<P>There is a <HI>general Return</HI> of Obedience, which we are to <HI>praise</HI> God by yielding of. It is said in <HI>Phil.</HI> 1.11. <HI>the fruits of Righteous|ness are unto the glory and praise of God.</HI> When God had carried <HI>Israel</HI> over <HI>Jordan,</HI> there were <HI>Stones</HI> erected for His praise; but what was inscribed on them? was it any History of what had been done by God? No, it was a <HI>Copy of the Law.</HI> Our keeping the Law is our <HI>praising</HI> of him that gave it. We <HI>praise</HI> God when we fear and blush to do any thing that he may be displeased at.</P>
<P>There is also a <HI>special Return</HI> of well-do|ing which we should now and then <HI>praise</HI> God withal. As when <HI>David</HI> had seen ma|ny mighty things done by God, he became inquisitive, in <HI>2 Sam.</HI> 7.2. <HI>What shall I now do for the House of God?</HI> so some signal act of <HI>Piety,</HI> or of <HI>Charity</HI> should be done by us, that God may not be without his <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">.</HI> We <HI>praise</HI> God when we are labour<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="4 letters">
<PB N="18" REF="000540_0026_0FA6B5C12F36B350">
to do <HI>some singular thing,</HI> for the advance|ment of His Truths and Wayes.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly</HI> We are to <HI>Spread</HI> the <HI>Praises</HI> due to God for the <HI>excellent things</HI> that He has done. Yea, our outmost is to be done that they may be <HI>known in all the Earth.</HI></P>
<P>A good man desires that he may not be <HI>Alone</HI> in the <HI>praising of God,</HI> he would have all men to joyn with him in it. It is there|fore said by such a man, <HI>Come, I will declare what God has done for my Soul.</HI> We are to <HI>praise</HI> God as <HI>publickly</HI> and as <HI>openly</HI> as we can; and to say like him in <HI>Psal.</HI> 22.25. <HI>My praise shall be of thee, in the great Congregation.</HI> And we are to do what we fairly can, that the excellent <HI>things</HI> done by God, may not be <HI>concealed things,</HI> but that all men may be acquainted with them: so are we advised in <HI>Psal.</HI> 105.1,2. <HI>Give thanks to the Lords, make known His Deeds among the people: sing unto Him, talk ye of all His wondrous Works.</HI> We should render them as <HI>Notorious</HI> as they are <HI>Notable;</HI> and <HI>publish them</HI> among all our Neighbours, as the happy <HI>partakers</HI> did the healing <HI>Miracles</HI> of our Lord Jesus Christ. Hence it was the wish of the Psalmist, in <HI>Psal.</HI> 26.7. <HI>That I may publish with the voice of Thanks giving, and tell of all thy wondrous works.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="000540_0027_0FA6B5C1A73FCE48">
Yea, when God has done <HI>Excellent things,</HI> we are not only to <HI>speak</HI> of them, but (If we can) to <HI>write</HI> of them too. Every good man should leave to his Children, a <HI>Diary</HI> for a <HI>Legacy.</HI> Some written <HI>Memorials</HI> and <HI>Experiences</HI> of <HI>Excellens things</HI> which a good, man in the time of his Pilgrimage hath seen done by the most High; these would be will worth bequeathing to them that should come after him, that they may set <HI>their hope in Gods.</HI></P>
<P>And the more considerable Appearances of God in every Generation, ought with a fuller Publication to be transmitted unto Posterity, by the Pens of good Historians. That we have no more Books of <HI>Remarkable Providences,</HI> is an Omission that has wrong'd and rob'd the Almighty God of more than a Million <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">.</HI> There should be compiled sufficient <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> ratives of the <HI>excellent things,</HI> oc|curring in every Age and every place; like the Books of <HI>Jasher,</HI> and <HI>Nathan,</HI> and <HI>Iddo,</HI> and other <HI>Seers;</HI> or like the <HI>Pillars</HI> among many Monuments of Antiquity.

<P>It is an <HI>excellent thing</HI> indeed, that we may have <HI>a Day of Thanksgiving,</HI> while the World is in so much Confusion and Combustion, and every where <HI>Mens hearts are failing them for fear, and for looking after those things which are doing upon the Earth.</HI> Let us be at some pains, that this Day be not lost, or that it may not evaporate in a few fensual satisfac|tions.

<P><HI>Day's of Thanksgiving</HI> as they are among the most <HI>Heavenly,</HI> so they will be among the most <HI>prosperous,</HI> of all our Devotions.

<P>But as for <HI>Dayes of Thanksgiving</HI> observed in the Assemblies of good men; all men have seen the wonderful successes of them. <HI>New-Englands</HI> Prosperity has more visibly followed upon its <HI>Thanksgivings</HI> than upon its <HI>Humiliations,</HI> as in times both of <HI>War</HI> and of <HI>Sickness,</HI> has been more than once percei|ved.

<P>Consider how <HI>Reasonable</HI> these <HI>praises</HI> are for us all.</P>

<P>My <HI>Brethren,</HI> there are <HI>Excellent things</HI> which our God has of late been doing in the <HI>English</HI> World.

<P N="I">I. The Late <HI>Revolutions</HI> in the Land of our Fore-Fathers Graves, afford unto us a sight of <HI>Excellent Things</HI> which ought to be had in <HI>Everlasting Remembrance.</HI></P>
<P>And here,</P>
<P>The first and great and most comprehen|sive matter of our <HI>Praises</HI> is, <HI>The happy accession of their Majesties,</HI> King <HI>Wil|liam,</HI> and Queen <HI>Mary, To the Throne of the Three Kingdoms.</HI></P>

<HI>This is the Lords Doing, and it is Marvellous in our Eyes!</HI> It made a Second <HI>EIGHTY EIGHT</HI> out-shining that in the former Century. For,</P>
<P>Consider, the <HI>Season</HI> of it. It was when the <HI>Protestant Religion</HI> was Lying at the Stake; and foreign Popish Writers did not stick to tell the World in Print, That there was a <HI>Private League</HI> made between two of the most Potent.

It was when the <HI>Indefatigable</HI> Drudg|es of the Papacy, who had more than Ten years before declared, <HI>We have here a Mig<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">y Work upon our Hands, no less than the Con|version of three Kingdoms, and by that perhaps the utter subduing a Pesi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">lent Heresy, which has domineered a long time over a great part of this Northern World; whereof never such Hopes as now;</HI> had now got all the Advantageous Posts of the Nation into their Hands, and had so model'd all their Business that they counted themselves <HI>cut of the Reach of chance for ever;</HI> and were even teady! like <HI>Human</HI> to cast Lots for a <HI>Lucky Day</HI> to throw all their Vizards off. It was when the <HI>Fundamental

Laws</HI> of the Kingdom were overturned, and the <HI>Frogs</HI> of the <HI>Romish Egypt</HI> were swar|ming in a main, to take possession of the <HI>Glorious Holy Mountain between the Seas.</HI> When things were thought hastening to that pass, that every vacancy in the publick Employ|ments would have made several <HI>Proselytes</HI> un|to Popery; when a great Creation would suddenly have given the <HI>Papists</HI> a majority in the House of <HI>Lords,</HI> and New <HI>Charters</HI> with Bold <HI>Returns</HI> might quickly have given them a Majority in the House of <HI>Commons</HI> too; a Condition of Affairs that was for|midable to all that penetrate into the Ten|dencies of <HI>Popery.</HI></P>
<P>THEN it was that the (then) Prince of ORANGE entred upon his Glorious Enter|prize of Rescuing the Church of <HI>G</HI>od from the Bloody Altar, which it was now bound upon; and the Protestant Princes Com|bining with him, offered up their <HI>Vows</HI> to God, for the prosperity of this Important Undertaking, as counting that in the mis|carriage of it, <HI>All was Lost.</HI> There had been one or two Attempts made before, but a <HI>wrong step</HI> taken in them, onely brought a R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ine upon the unhappy peo|ple Engaged therein.

<P>Consider also the <HI>Manner</HI> of it. It was the Expectation which the Late Earl of <HI>Ar|g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">le</HI> Expired withal, That God would ac|complish His work, <HI>Not by Might, nor by Power, but by His own most Holy Spirit.</HI> And <HI>so</HI> it has been done! The <HI>Spirit</HI> of God incli|ned the <HI>Dutch</HI> to give their Great PRINCE in the Assistence that could be given. When the Navy, with such Wonderful Turns of the <HI>Wind,</HI> as argued a particular Care of God about it, was come into its Harbour, the <HI>Spi|rit of God</HI> strangely inclined persons of all Degrees to an Agreement with the Princes <HI>Declaration:</HI> it was a <HI>Touch</HI> of God upon their Souls! Whence, though the Nation were <HI>D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">hauched</HI> on purpose to make <HI>Popery</HI> ac|ceptable to them, yet many thousands that were of no Religion at all, could not now fight for <HI>that</HI> Religion. The same <HI>Spirit</HI> sent a Terror into the Great Oppressors of the Nation, so that though there was a vast Army to oppose the Prince, the very <HI>sound,</HI> of his Approach, put them to Rout, equal

<HEAD>A Passage in Mr. Flavels Thanksgiving-Sermon, Preached Febr.14. 1688.</HEAD>
<P>SHall we Ingratefully Overlook the Be|ginnings of Mercy, as small and Incon|siderable Things? Shall we say, <HI>All this is Nothing,</HI> because we have not yet <HI>All</HI> that we would have? God forbid. When I<HI>srael</HI> was in <HI>Egypt,</HI> then a Little Straw would have been Esteemed as a great Mercy; but after|wards <HI>Quails</HI> and <HI>Manna</HI> were Despised. Bre|thren, Three or Four Years ago, you would have Accounted it a Special Mercy, to have Enjoy'd an Hour or Two together in <HI>Prayer,</HI> or to have had a Little Spiritual Bread Hand|ed to you, behind your Enemies Backs; and is it nothing in your Eyes this Day, to behold the Worship of God at Liberty? Yea, to see the <HI>Success</HI> of the <HI>Gospel,</HI> in bringing home of many Souls to Christ? The Fears of <HI>Po|pery</HI> vanished? The <HI>Witnesses Risen;</HI> the <HI>Tenth-part</HI> of the City fallen; and such a prospect of far greater and more glorious Things before your Eyes? O let not the Consolations of the Almighty seem small.</P>

<HEAD>A Postscript.</HEAD>
<P>Endeavouring the Satisfaction of them that are <HI>I</HI>nquisitive after the late Stu|pendous Extasies and Prophesies in <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>THe <HI>Words</HI> of God are <HI>True,</HI> in the Notice which they have given us, <HI>That the Works of God are Great;</HI> and certainly no Age did ever afford In|stances of <HI>Greater</HI> than those which are <HI>Now</HI> the matters of Discourse and Wonder throughout the World.</P>
<P>Among the <HI>Marvellous Things</HI> which at this Day strike the minds of Men with a just A|stonishment, there are not many more con|siderable, than those of <HI>the late Extasies in France.</HI> Concerning, which we have un|doubted Information;</P>
<P>That about the beginning of the Year 1688: a young Shepardess in the Province of <HI>Dauphine,</HI> fell into unaccountable <HI>Trances,</HI> wherein tho' the standers by, pull'd her, struck her, cut her and burnt her, yet it was impos|sible to awaken her. In this condition, her custome was to utter many Divine things;
<PB N="58" REF="000540_0066_0FA6B5F47AE64710">
and though she could neither write nor read, nor could speak any <HI>Language</HI> but that of her Countrey, which has nothing of pure <HI>French</HI> in it, yet she now <HI>Pray'd</HI> and <HI>Preach'd</HI> at a most prodigious rate, and Sang <HI>Psalms</HI> after the manner of the <HI>French</HI> Protestant Congregations: and when Auditors that could thereby be edified, were present, she expressed herself, not only in <HI>French</HI> of a Dialect most Exact and Correct, but also having occasion to speak <HI>Latin,</HI> in the Refu|tation of the <HI>Romish Superstitions,</HI> she did it with a distinctness that fill'd all the Hearers with Admiration. And though when she came out of her sleep, she remembred not what had befallen her; yet she had her wits thereby made more Sparkling and Refi|ned.</P>
<P>Those new <HI>French</HI> Apostles, the <HI>Dragoons,</HI> quickly did their utmost, for the suppression of this <HI>Rare Thing;</HI> but behold the event! It was not long before other persons fell into the like <HI>Trances,</HI> with <HI>Symptoms</HI> not unlike to those which had attended her; and the Number encreased unto several Hundreds of these <HI>Prophets,</HI> if I may call them so? where<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> of even the Kings own Guards afforded <HI>One.</HI> And at length some that were <HI>Awake</HI> were carried forth unto Rapturous Exercises with an <HI>Eloquence</HI> and <HI>Energy</HI> equal to that of those that were <HI>Asleep.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="000540_0067_0FA6B5F5365C8100">
They are People of all Ages and Sexes; but the greatest part of them are <HI>Boyes</HI> and <HI>Girles,</HI> from six or seven to five and twenty years of age; and persons very old; all of them the meaner sort of People: but of Fami|lies Exemplary for their good living; the whole affair being indeed so prodigious, that the most obstinate <HI>Saddu cees</HI> in the Kingdom confess it, <HI>A natural Distemper directed by Pro|vidence to procure the Repentance of a sinful World.</HI></P>
<P>The Ministry of these <HI>Extraordinary People,</HI> does chiefly consist of two things.</P>
<P>One part of it is, the <HI>Admonition</HI> of those unhappy persons that have provoked God by many notorious Miscarriages, but especi|ally by <HI>Apostasie</HI> under the late Persecution. They deride the Follies of the <HI>Mass,</HI> with a surprizing ingenuity; and in a vast Assem|bly of perhaps two thousand People come together to hear these <HI>Preachers,</HI> if there be any that have abjured the <HI>Protestant Religion,</HI> they will call them before them, and address them in such powerful Terms, as usually make not not only the whole Congregation shed floods of Tears, but the <HI>Apostates</HI> them|selves to become <HI>Penitents:</HI> and there comes not one away, who does not positively de|clare, <HI>That he had rather be torn to pieces with wild Horses than ever go to Mass again.</HI> No
<PB N="60" REF="000540_0068_0FA6B5F7C5776A00">
man is able to resist their Words! And they make the <HI>Penitents</HI> now and then confess o|ther particular sins, which they convince them of, though the Transgressors had ima|gined these Faults impossible to be discover|ed. A whole Council assembled could not manage any matter with more Authority than <HI>They</HI> do the Conviction of those, who have gone to <HI>Mass,</HI> that they may shun the Severities of the <HI>French Dragoons.</HI></P>
<P>It may not be unprofitable to recite a few of the Sentences, which fell from the mouths of these <HI>Extaticks.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Have a care</HI> (said one of them) <HI>that you come not hither out of Curiosity. Better it w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ere for the Wicked that hot Coals of Fire should p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ss through their mouths, than that they should mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">k at the Word of God; they had better swallow a Serpent with all its Poison.</HI></P>
<P><HI>If the Wicked</HI> (said one of them) <HI>had the same power over God, that they have over you, they would do the same to Him that they do to you: but God will pronounce the Sentence of Ma|lediction on them, and will say,</HI> Go into Eter|nal Fire.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI> (said another of them) <HI>Pray hard; and then though we should meet an Army of Enemies at the Door, God will place a million of Angels for your Guard.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI> (said another of them) <HI>We
<PB N="61" REF="000540_0069_0FA6B5F8DD1CF8F0">
have alwayes apprehended more the Threats of Men than those of God, else what happened to us, would not have happened.</HI></P>
<P>One of them said, <HI>Your Riches have ruined you, and your Prayers must Relieve you.</HI></P>
<P>One of them said, <HI>I am afraid the first Per|secution will make you return to Mass again; but O suffer your selves rather to be first out in pieces.</HI> Alas! <HI>Jesus Christ has poured out all his Blood for us, and we can't endure the prick of a pin for Him.</HI></P>
<P>To the <HI>Apostates,</HI> they generally so con|clude their Warnings; <HI>You have sinned a|gainst the Father, you have sinned against the Son, take heed of sinning against the Holy Ghost, for God will then pardon you no more.</HI></P>
<P>And when the Children are told, <HI>They shall be Hang'd,</HI> they are not at all afraid, but answer, <HI>That is but a little harm for a greater good.</HI></P>
<P>But the other part of their Ministry is, The P<HI>rediction</HI> of Things quickly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> come to pass. They do indeed foretell many Things of a more private concern; they foretell a thou|sand Things that must happen to themselves and their Friends: and the issue confirms the Prophesie. One of them being thrown into a Dungeon, said,. <HI>The man who sent her thither should within eight Dayes fetch her out,</HI> and it strangely was accomplished.</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="000540_0070_0FA6B5F9B6E02C08">
But the Things of a more publick Con|cern, are chiefly those which they foretel. The Gentlemen, who give us the History, tell us, that they judge it not yet convenient to publish a large part of the Authentick and sufficient Collections which they have made of these Prophecies. However, they have given us a Taste. In general, The Subjects of this <HI>Enthusiasm</HI> all agree in fore|telling, <HI>A Speedy Deliverance to the Church of God:</HI> and they declare, <HI>The Late Revolutions in England, to be the Beginning of that Delive|rance.</HI></P>
<P>Tho' all <HI>France</HI> was fill'd with a Rumour, That the Late K. <HI>James</HI> had Defeated the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> (then) Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> both by Land and <HI>S</HI>ea, <HI>these</HI> then said, <HI>The Authors of these Re|port, commit a great sin, for the Prince of O|range has Chas'd, and shall Chase the King out of</HI> England; <HI>and that is the Beginning of the Deliverance of the Church.</HI></P>
<P>They foretold a fresh Assault of Persecu|tion in <HI>France,</HI> and it had a very dreadful fulfilment; for after it Ensued a Terrible Storm of Outrage upon the Relicks of Pro|testantism in the Desolate Kingdom: in one Article of which, there was a Massacre, of about four hundred people; but they foretold within how many Days the Persecution should be over; and they give hopes of a <HI>Protestant
<PB N="63" REF="000540_0071_0FA6B5FA7B94BF20">
King,</HI> very quickly to be seen in <HI>France.</HI> They proclaim, <HI>The Divel is going to be shut up in the midst of Hell!</HI> They say, <HI>The Accomplish|ment of the</HI> P<HI>rophetical Months and Dayes is at Hand; but it must be accompanied with very Terrible Wars and Plagues.</HI></P>
<P>The whole is a Thing very unaccountable: and when I consider the Fate of the famous <HI>German Prophets,</HI> which made such a Noife in the World: or, when I consider, that while the <HI>Jews</HI> were under their Infatuations about their false Messiah, <HI>Sabatai Soevi,</HI> some Hundreds of people fell into <HI>Extasies</HI> (as 'tis Reported) wherein they Prophesied, the speedy Deliverance of the Jews by that impostor, and <HI>Little Children</HI> that could not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">tammer a word, yet repeated and pronoun|ced the <HI>Name</HI> of this Deceiver, with Happy Omens of Him but consider on the other side, That <HI>not to Regard the Works of the Lord,</HI> i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> a <HI>Destroying evil;</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> make any Reflections on it.

<HEAD>The Preface,</HEAD>
<P><HI>THe Occasion which first produced the fol|lowing Sermon, cannot be expressed in better Terms, that those which were used by the Worthy Gentlemen that were the</HI> Conservators of our peace, <HI>in their humble Address to Their Majesties, bearing Date, May 20th 1689. Wherein among other things they say,</HI></P>
<P>&mdash;Your three several Princely Declarati|ons, Encouraging the English Nation, to cast off the Yoke of a Tyrannical and Arbitrary Power, which at that time they were held un|der, have occurred unto the View and Consi|deration of the people in this Countrey, be|ing themselves under alike (if not worse) evil and unhappy Circumstances with their Brethren in <HI>England;</HI> First by being un|righteously deprived of their Charter-Go|vernment, &amp; Priviledges, without any Hear|ing or Tryal, and under utter impossibilities of having Notice of any Writt served upon them; and then followed with the Exercise of an illegal and Arbitrary power over them, which had almost ruined a late flourishing Countrey, and was become very grievous &amp; intolerable; besides the growing miseries,
<PB REF="000540_0076_0FA6B5FF146920D0">
and daily fears of a total Subversion, by ene|mies at home, and Invasion by forreign force; the people thereby excited, to imitate so no|ble and heroic an Exemple, being strongly and unanimously spirited, to intend their own safeguard and Defence, resolved to sieze up|on and secure some of the principal persons concerned, and most active in the ill manage|ment, of the illegal and arbitrary Govern|ment, set over them by Commission. Accor|dingly upon the eighteenth day of <HI>April,</HI> last past, arose as one man, siezed upon Sr. <HI>E. An|dros</HI> the late Governour, and other of the e|vil instruments, and have secured them for what Justice, Order from your Majesties shall direct.&mdash;<HI>Thus that Address.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Upon the late Revolutions thus described, en|sued various debates about the further</HI> Steps <HI>that were needful to be taken for the service of Their Majesties and this afflicted Countrey; Which</HI> De|bates <HI>quickly issued in the Return of our Govern|ment, into the Hands of our Ancient Magistrates; who with the</HI> Representatives <HI>or</HI> Deputies <HI>of the several Towns in the Colony, made another Address unto Their Majesties, bearing date, June 6. 1689. in which Address there were these Words.</HI></P>
<P>&mdash;Finding an Absolute Necessity of Civil Government, the People generally manifest|ed their Desires and Importunity once and a|gain
<PB REF="000540_0077_0FA6B6000C0E22C8">
That the Governour, Deputy Govern|our and Assistants, chosen and sworn in May 1686. according to Charter &amp; Court as then formed, would assume the Government;&mdash;</P>
<P>&mdash;the said Governour, Deputy-Governour, and Assistents, then Resident in the Colony, did Consent to accept the present Care and Government of this people, according to the Rules of the Charter, for the preservation of the Peace and common safety, and the put|ting forth further Acts of Authority, upon Emergencies: until by Direction from <HI>Eng|land,</HI> there should be an orderly Settlement; which we hope will Restore us to the full Ex|ercise thereof, as formerly; notwithstanding we have, for some time, been most unrigh|teously, and injuriously deprived of it.</P>
<P>That Royal Charter being the sole Induce|ment and Encouragement unto our Fathers and predecessors, to come over into this Wil|derness, and to plant the same at their own Cost and Charge.</P>
<P><HI>In Answer to this Address, His Majesty in a most gracious Letter, bearing Date the 12th of August</HI> 1689. <HI>unto the Government here, uses these Expressions,</HI></P>
<P>Whereas you give Us to understand, that you have taken upon you the present care of the Government, until you should receive Our Order therein, We do hereby Authori<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">e and
<PB REF="000540_0078_0FA6B6021A1B6150">
Empower you to Continue in Our Name, your Care in the Administration thereof, and Preservation of the Peace, until We shall have taken such Resolutions, and given such Di|rections for the more orderly Settlement of the said Government, as shall most conduce to Our Service, and the Security and Satis|faction of Our Subjects within that Our Colony.</P>
<P><HI>It was in the time of our greatest</HI> Heats <HI>and</HI> Straits, <HI>and at a time appointed for a</HI> General Assembly <HI>of this great Colony, that the ensu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ing Sermon was expected from me. Through the Grace of God, the Sermon</HI> Then <HI>was not alto|gether unacceptable to some who desired the Pub|lication of it. But I gave not my full Consent unto their Desire, until now, they had an</HI> Op|portunity <HI>(with their Renewed</HI> Im<HI>portunity) to join in with another Discourse which they have ob|tained from me; and tho' the little</HI> Differen|ces <HI>which were among us, when the Sermon was preached, are now so well Composed, yet I flatter any self with an opinion, that the things here in|sisted on, will not, should not be judg'd</HI> Unsea|sonable.</P>
<P><HI>I confess it is a very</HI> Bold <HI>thing, for one every way so</HI> mean <HI>as my self, to Address the whole Countrey in such a manner as here I do; but,</HI> Si crimen erit, crimen <HI>Amoris</HI> erit; <HI>and if the general Dispositions of the year will not ex|cuse
<PB REF="000540_0079_0FA6B60317AA2AA0">
a Breach of</HI> Order <HI>in me, I have but one thing more to offer by way of Satisfaction for it. There was once a people in the world, with whom it was a Custome, That when men would Conci|liate the Favour of the</HI> Ruler, <HI>they were to pre|sent his own</HI> Son <HI>before him, as a</HI> Sight <HI>which would speak more than any Advocate. Instead thereof, that I may not want the Favour of my</HI> Countrey, <HI>how blameable soever they may count my freedome with them, I shall only present them with my own</HI> Father; <HI>whose cheerful Encounter with an hazardous Voyage unto a strange Land, and with innumerable Difficulties and Temptati|ons these, for no other Cause, than that he might</HI> Speak FOR <HI>them, has at least merited oe Pardon for</HI> Mce, <HI>with whom he has for near two years now left both his</HI> Church <HI>and</HI> Family, <HI>if I have transgressed by taking a Liberty of</HI> Speak|ing To <HI>them at the same time, the things which may promote our Enjoyment of the</HI> Divine Pre|sence <HI>with us. Now, may</HI> Salvation be nigh unto us, <HI>and</HI> Glory dwell in our Land!</P>

<BIBL>It is the Word of the Eternal GOD in II. Chron. XV. 2.</BIBL>
<Q><HI>Hear ye me,</HI> Asa, <HI>and all</HI> Judah, <HI>and</HI> Benjamin: <HI>the Lord is with you while you are with Him.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IT is a <HI>Remarkable Occasion</HI> which has brought these Words to be the Sub|ject of our present Meditations; but it was much more a <HI>Remarkable Occasion</HI> which these Words were first uttered upon. We find them in the Sacred Book of <HI>Chronicles,</HI> which <HI>Chronicles</HI> are not the <HI>Civil Records,</HI> in other-parts of the Bible refer'd unto; but an Inspired History of things that concerned the <HI>Line</HI> of Christ and the <HI>Church</HI> of God for five hundred more than Three Thousand
<PB N="2" REF="000540_0081_0FA6B60438CAB240">
years. It seems as an <HI>Epitome</HI> of the <HI>Whole,</HI> (for so tis in <HI>Jerom's</HI> Language) to be writ|ten as <HI>late</HI> as the <HI>Last</HI> of all the Books in the Old Testament; and the Hebrew Bibles give it a place accordingly. The Greeks choose to entitle it, <HI>The Book of things</HI> (else where) <HI>passed by;</HI> because, as <HI>Lyra</HI> notes, according to the Rule of our Saviour, <HI>It gathers Frag|ments that nothing may be lost;</HI> and if there were nothing else but the Story which affords our Text unto us, to justifie that Appellation, it were enough: 'tis a Story <HI>passed</HI> by in the Book of <HI>Kings;</HI> but worthy to be <HI>had in e|verlasting Remembrance.</HI></P>
<P>The ready Pen of <HI>Ezra</HI> (for him we con|jecture to be the Scribe of the Holy Spirit here, notwithstanding those few Clauses which may be judged to be added by another hand after his Decease, I say the Pen of <HI>Ez|ra</HI>) is here informing us, That the people of God had newly been invaded by a vast Ar|my of <HI>Cushites;</HI> but we are yet at a loss who these <HI>Cushites</HI> were? Far more <HI>Scholars</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the World, than there were <HI>Souldiers</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> that Army have hitherto been content with our Translation, which renders them <HI>Ethiopians</HI> here. But that learned French-man <HI>Bochart,</HI> by whose happy industry, more than any man's, the Treasures in the Bowels of the Scriptures have been dely'd into, has with
<PB N="3" REF="000540_0082_0FA6B60500099CF0">
irrefragable Demonstration prov'd, That not <HI>Ethiopians</HI> but <HI>Arabians</HI> are the <HI>Cushites</HI> men|tioned in the Oracles of God. These <HI>Ara|bians,</HI> tho they have not been called <HI>Saracens</HI> (as has been thought) from their word <HI>Sa|rak,</HI> that signifies, <HI>to Steal;</HI> yet for their <HI>Eu|racious</HI> Inclinations, they well deserved such an Etymology; they were a wild sort of men, that liv'd much upon the Rapin and Ruin of their Neighbours; and particularly, a <HI>Million</HI> of them now designed <HI>Jerusalem</HI> for a prey. The blessed God gave His peo|ple a notable victory over these Invaders, and they were now returning from <HI>Gerar</HI> (a place between thirty and forty miles off) un|to <HI>Jerusalem.</HI> The Holy Spirit of God exci|ted and inclined a Prophet whose Name was <HI>Az<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">iah,</HI> to entertain them with a faithful &amp; solid Sermon hereupon; and in my Text you have the Sum and Substance of it.</P>
<P>We may observe,</P>
<P>First, The <HI>Proeface</HI> of it; and that is very awful and earnest: <HI>Hear ye me</HI> Asa, <HI>and all</HI> Judah, <HI>and</HI> Benjamin. As he was proba|bly none of the <HI>greatest,</HI> so tis like he was none of the <HI>oldest</HI> men; for it seems by the eighth verse, that his <HI>Father</HI> was yet alive, &amp; present at this time. Yet being to speak in the Name of the great and eternal God, he expects, he demands the attention of the
<PB N="4" REF="000540_0083_0FA6B605B7472750">
whole Army to him.</P>
<P>Secondly, the <HI>Design</HI> of it; and that is, to decclare both the <HI>Rise</HI> and <HI>Use</HI> of their late Prosperity. <HI>The Lord is with you, while you you are with Him;</HI> or as the Vulgar Latin has it, <HI>Inasmuch as you have been with him.</HI> What follows, is but an Explication, and Ampli|fication of <HI>this.</HI> He saw they were taken up with various Businesses and Contrivances; they had their Enemies under Hatches, and their minds were full of Thoughts and Cares, <HI>What to do next?</HI> But he calls them off to <HI>ac|knowledge</HI> the <HI>Presence</HI> of God, as the cause of their coming off so well in their late <HI>Action,</HI> and <HI>above all things</HI> to <HI>obtain</HI> &amp; <HI>secure</HI> the <HI>presence</HI> of God, that they might come off as well, in in their future Enterprises.</P>
<P>I am therefore to call for your Attention unto this <HI>Faithful Saying.</HI></P>
<P>DOCT. That <HI>The GOD of Heaven will be</HI> with <HI>a people while they are with Him.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis by the ensuing <HI>Propositions,</HI> that the <HI>Explication</HI> of this Truth shall be <HI>endeavoured.</HI></P>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="proposition">
<HEAD>PROPOSITION. I.</HEAD>
<P>It is the <HI>Interest,</HI> and should be the <HI>Desire,</HI> of Every people to have the God of Heaven <HI>With them.</HI> But we are to enquire,</P>
<P><HI>What is implied in that</HI> presence of GOD, <HI>which we are to be solicitous about?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="000540_0084_0FA6B606BA138DC0">
For Answer to this; There is a Threefold <HI>Presence of God,</HI> mentioned in the <HI>Scripture of Truth.</HI></P>
<P>First, God is <HI>Naturally</HI> present with all Crea|tures. He is an <HI>Immense Being,</HI> and no Crea|ture can be without him. The Apostle thus argued in the Court at <HI>Athens,</HI> in <HI>Act,</HI> 17.27. <HI>God is not far from every one of us.</HI> No, He is <HI>near</HI> us all, He is <HI>with</HI> us all. And <HI>Paul</HI> could have had the Gentiles themselves con|fessing it; for besides what their <HI>Seneca</HI> did own, One of their own Poets had said, <HI>Jovis omnia plena.</HI> It is the Speech of our God, in <HI>Jer.</HI> 23. 24. <HI>Do not I fill Heaven and Earth, saith the Lord?</HI> Yea, <HI>That</HI> He do's. The Jews call God by the Name of <HI>Makom,</HI> or of <HI>Place,</HI> because all things are in Him; this is His Name in the Book of <HI>Esther,</HI> if I mis|take it not. Whether we may count it <HI>pro|per</HI> and <HI>physical</HI> to speak of an <HI>Imaginary, In|finite space,</HI> beyond the utmost Selvige of the world, replenished with our God alone; yet we are sure that <HI>the Heaven of Heavens</HI> gives no limits unto His Being; and the Ancients were not mistaken when they said, <HI>Deus Ipse Sibi, et Mundus et Locus et Omnia.</HI> We can|not so well say, That God is in the <HI>World,</HI> as we may say, The whole World is in <HI>God;</HI> &amp; we may say with the Psalmist, in <HI>Psal.</HI> 139.7. <HI>Whither shall I flee from thy presence?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="000540_0085_0FA6B60740A35868">
<HI>Secondly,</HI> God is <HI>Gloriously</HI> present with the Inhabitants of the Third Heaven. The Hea|ven of Heavens hath in it most intimate and marvellous manifestations of God. It is the <HI>Place,</HI> of which we may say, as tis said of that <HI>State,</HI> in Rev. 21. 23. <HI>The glory of God doth lighten it.</HI> There the blessed ones have God <HI>with</HI> them, so that they <HI>Alwayes behold His face;</HI> and they are <HI>satisfied with His like|ness</HI> for ever. When we come to Heaven, then as in I. Thes. 4. 17. <HI>We shall ever be with the Lord.</HI> So the Lord will be <HI>with us</HI> for ever. Heaven is the <HI>Throne</HI> of the Most High; He is there as a Prince in his Throne; the Great KING is in a manner very ineffa|ble residing there. To be there, is called in 2. Cor. 5. 4. A being <HI>present with the Lord.</HI> Hence unto the <HI>Heaven,</HI> and not unto a <HI>Bi|ble,</HI> are we directed to make our <HI>Corporal Ap|plications</HI> in our <HI>Prayers,</HI> or our <HI>Oathes</HI> before the Lord.</P>
<P>But Thirdly, God is <HI>Graciously</HI> present with His people, by being <HI>Favourable</HI> unto them. And this <HI>Gracious presence</HI> of God is that which a people ought to be concerned for. It lies in The <HI>Engagement of Divine Providence for the Welfare of such a people.</HI> God is <HI>with</HI> us when God is <HI>for</HI> us.</P>
<P>To particularize,</P>
<P>First, God is <HI>with</HI> a people by <HI>Directing</HI>
<PB N="7" REF="000540_0086_0FA6B60901CF6100">
of them. When <HI>Israel</HI> was to pass thro' the Wilderness, they had that encouragement, in Exod. 22. 15. <HI>The presence of God going</HI> with them. What was that? Why, They had a cloudy fiery <HI>Pillar</HI> miraculously Leading of them every step of the way; There was a wonderful Pillar which was a <HI>Cloud</HI> by day, and a <HI>Fire</HI> by night; the <HI>Lower</HI> part of which rested on the Tabernacle, while the <HI>Upper</HI> part was to be seen by the whole Congregati|on: the Motions of this being managed by the Ministry of Angels, now <HI>God</HI> was <HI>with them,</HI> and <HI>He led them forth by the right way.</HI> A people are often brought into a Wilder|ness of Difficulties and Emergencies: but if God be <HI>with</HI> them, He guides them to a good Issue of them all. The <HI>Presence</HI> of God ap|pears in His Directing and Inclining of a peo|ple to such Actions, as may be for <HI>His Ho|nour</HI> and <HI>their Safety,</HI> and such <HI>Methods,</HI> as may extricate them out of all Distresses. When God is <HI>with</HI> a people, He shapes their Counsels for them, and he disposes them to the Things that should be done. He supplies them with Apprehensions beyond the Reach and Verge of their own Wisdome, and He <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ayes before them <HI>Invitations,</HI> and <HI>Provocati|ons,</HI> which as it were push them into <HI>the way wherein they should go.</HI> When the Jews were upon a <HI>Re-Assumption</HI> of the desireable things
<PB N="8" REF="000540_0087_0FA6B60A252F4D68">
which the <HI>Babylonians</HI> had deprived 'em of' they took a <HI>Right Way</HI> to dissappoint all that were desirous to interrupt them in it. We find in Neh. 4. 13. That while those Exer|cises continued, they <HI>waited</HI> in a posture a|greeable thereunto; and when the danger was over, <HI>then they returned every one to his work.</HI> How came this to pass? 'Twas be|cause GOD was <HI>with</HI> them.</P>
<P>Secondly, God is <HI>with</HI> a People, by <HI>Protect|ing</HI> of them. 'Twas the promise of God un|to His people, in Isa. 43. 2. <HI>When thou passest thro' the Waters, I will be with thee, and thro' the Rivers, they shall not overflow thee.</HI> On which Text, blessed <HI>Bilney</HI> after his Condem|nation so sweetly paraphrased, that his Friends caused the whole Sentence to be fair|ly written on their Tables. A people may be ready to be swallow'd up, by a stormy, gaping Ocean of Troubles, but if God be <HI>with</HI> them, they shall escape clear of all. The <HI>Presence</HI> of God is a Defence, a Refuge to the people that are partakers of it. It was said unto <HI>David</HI> in <HI>2. Sam.</HI> 7. 9. <HI>I was</HI> with <HI>thee, and have cut off all thine enemies out of thy sight.</HI> When God is <HI>with</HI> a people, He distracts and confounds their enemies, and He troubles <HI>those</HI> who trouble <HI>them.</HI> A people who have God <HI>with</HI> them, are too strong for all the <HI>Malice</HI> and <HI>Power</HI> of their enemies; no Ad|versary
<PB N="9" REF="000540_0088_0FA6B60A3A5E17C8">
no Desolation, shall make such a peo|ple miserable; they are the <HI>Jacob,</HI> unto whom in <HI>Gen.</HI> 28. 15. <HI>Behold, I am</HI> with <HI>thee, and I will keep thee, saith the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly, God is <HI>with</HI> a people by His <HI>Assist|ing</HI> and <HI>Succeeding</HI> of them. When <HI>Joshua</HI> had a vast Undertaking in hand, it was said unto him in <HI>Cap.</HI> 1. 9. <HI>Be of good Courage, for the Lord thy God is</HI> with <HI>thee, whither soe|ver thou goest.</HI> q. d. <HI>God</HI> will <HI>Assist</HI> thee, and <HI>succeed</HI> thee, in thy undertakings. The <HI>Pre|sence</HI> of God will carry a people comfortably through all that they take in hand. If they have <HI>Canaanites</HI> to subdue; if they have <HI>En|joyments</HI> to obtain or preserve, the <HI>Presence</HI> of God will prosper them in doing all. It was said unto <HI>Solomon,</HI> in I. Chron.22. 11. <HI>My son, the Lord be</HI> with <HI>thee, and prosper thou, and build the house of the Lord thy God.</HI> Thus, if the Lord be <HI>with</HI> a people, they shall <HI>prosper</HI> In all their Affairs; in every <HI>Expedition,</HI> they shall come off with Satisfaction; and they shall not miscarry in any of their <HI>Applications.</HI> This is the <HI>Presence</HI> of the Lord.</P>

<HEAD>Proposition. II.</HEAD>
<P>The <HI>Presence</HI> of God with <HI>a people</HI> in His <HI>Outward Providence,</HI> has a diverse <HI>Foundation</HI> and <HI>Continuance</HI> from His Presence with <HI>His</HI> People, in the <HI>Covenant of Grace.</HI> As tis well
<PB N="10" REF="000540_0089_0FA6B60B427C7598">
observed by the great <HI>Owen,</HI> in a Discourse unto the Parliament, <HI>These two</HI> are to be care|fully distinguished. We must not reflect on the Stability of the <HI>New-Covenant,</HI> for what Variety and Soveraignty we may see in <HI>provi|dential Dispensations,</HI> toward this and that people in the world. This matter seems de|termined by <HI>David,</HI> in <HI>2. Sam.</HI> 23. 5. <HI>Tho' my house be not so with God, yet He has made with me an Everlasting Covenant, ordered in all things and sure. David</HI> had promises for the prosperity of his <HI>House;</HI> He had also the <HI>sure mercies</HI> of the Covenant made over to him in the promises of God. These promises had now a different Establishment; The <HI>Sure mer|cies</HI> of the Covenant, were unto him more <HI>Absolute</HI> and <HI>Immutable;</HI> but the prosperity of his <HI>House,</HI> we find under another Law, and subject unto a dreadful Alteration.</P>
<P>To bring these things into the case before us.</P>
<P>God has in the <HI>Covenant of Grace,</HI> promis|ed, That He will be <HI>with</HI> His people. This we read in <HI>Heb.</HI> 13. 5. <HI>He hath said, I will never leave thee nor forsake thee.</HI> The <HI>Alsuffi|cient God,</HI> who is HEE that answers our Ne|cessities, Let them be what they will; the <HI>Unchangeable</HI> God, who is a HE still, whatever He was to the Saints of old; this God hath <HI>said</HI> [and how much better is this <HI>Autos E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">reken</HI> than the best <HI>Ipse dixit</HI> in the world!
<PB N="11" REF="000540_0090_0FA6B60DA98A1FF0">
He hath <HI>said</HI> it, and this] with multipli'd <HI>Negatives,</HI> in the Original, heaped one upon another, <HI>I will not,</HI> I will not <HI>leave thee, I will not, I will not,</HI> I will not <HI>forsake thee.</HI> Well, but <HI>God</HI> is not <HI>with</HI> a people in His <HI>outward</HI> Pro|vidence just after the manner therein observed.</P>
<P>This Two-fold <HI>Presence</HI> of God;</P>
<P>First, It has a Diverse <HI>Foundation.</HI> When we look on the <HI>Covenant of Grace,</HI> there the <HI>Sins</HI> of one are explated by the <HI>Sufferings</HI> of another; and so, God comes to be <HI>with</HI> His people, for whom the Atonement is thus Pro|cured. Thus tis said in 2. Cor. 5. 25. Christ was <HI>made sin</HI> [or a Sin-offering] <HI>for us, that we might become the Righteousness of God in Him.</HI> Now come to <HI>outward Providence,</HI> and there you see other measures taken. Here God is <HI>with</HI> a people, according to those Terms, in Ezek. 18.20. <HI>The Soul that</HI> sinneth IT <HI>shall dye; one shall not bear the Iniquity of nother.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Again,</HI> It hath a Diverse <HI>Continuance.</HI> When we look on the <HI>Covenant of Grace,</HI> there God hath <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ound Himself to be <HI>with</HI> His peo|ple for ever; yea, to see that they shall there|fore for ever be with <HI>Him.</HI> He there sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">es as in Jer. 32. 40. <HI>I will not turn away from them to do them good, but I will put My fear in their hearts, that they shall not depart from Me.</HI> Now come to <HI>outward Providence;</HI> and there
<PB N="12" REF="000540_0091_0FA6B60DF9F5A580">
you see tis otherwise. God is <HI>with</HI> a people for a while; and upon <HI>their</HI> misbehaviours and provocations, He changes the Tenour of His Dispensations to them. Tis with them, as it was with that family, in <HI>I. Sam.</HI> 2.30. <HI>I said indeed, that thy house should walk be|fore me forever; But now the Lord sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">es, that be far from me.</HI></P>
<P>The sense of these things will prepare your Thoughts for one Conclusion more, which is,</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="proposition">
<HEAD>Proposition. III.</HEAD>
<P>A People must be with <HI>God,</HI> or God will not be with <HI>them.</HI> And here also, to prevent Mistakes, Let that one Text be alwaies car|ried in our Minds; <HI>Neh.</HI> 9. 18. <HI>Being merci|ful, thou for sookest them not;</HI> there is <HI>Mercy</HI> in the Whole of this matter. Let it be noted, That tho' this Condition seems to be <HI>im<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">sed</HI> upon us; yet it is <HI>Grace,</HI> pure <HI>Grace,</HI> rich <HI>Grace</HI> that helps us, when we are helped un|to the performance of it. When a people have so been <HI>with</HI> God, as that He has been <HI>with</HI> them, they are to shout, <HI>Grace, Grace!</HI> concerning all. It is also to be noted, that this <HI>Benefit</HI> dos not depend upon that Con|dition, as an <HI>Effect</HI> upon the real and proper <HI>cause</HI> of it. When a people has been <HI>with</HI> God, this does not <HI>merit,</HI> and <HI>so</HI> procure that God should be with <HI>them;</HI> but <HI>that</HI> is barely the <HI>Antecedent</HI> unto which, <HI>this</HI> is the <HI>Conse|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="4 letters">.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="000540_0092_0FA6B60EC0603100">
Having praemsed this I must now affirm, <HI>God is</HI> with <HI>you, while you are</HI> with <HI>Him.</HI> We need only reflect on the People of <HI>Israel,</HI> for an Instance of it. That whole History, which almost fills the Bible, proclames nothing more than this; it loudly declares, That while a people are <HI>with</HI> God, God will be <HI>with</HI> them; but that He will be very Terrible in His <HI>pro|vidential Dispensations</HI> towards such a people as do <HI>forsake</HI> Him.</P>
<P>But, What is it for a people to be <HI>With God?</HI> In short,</P>
<P>Our being <HI>With God,</HI> implies the Whole of our <HI>Obedience</HI> to Him. Our <HI>Duty</HI> to God must be attended, that we may have the <HI>Pre|sence</HI> of God. The Wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">oe of this Duty is comprised in that Expression of our being <HI>with the Lord.</HI> Particularly the Hebrew Particle <HI>[<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">im]</HI> in our Text, admits of three Signi|fications; it signifies, <HI>With,</HI> and <HI>For,</HI> &amp; <HI>Like,</HI> [which last Signification I make the more free withal, because a little <HI>Philology</HI> will ac|quaint us with many Exemples of it: for in|stance, When <HI>David</HI> saith in Psal. 120, 5. <HI>I dwell in</HI> (<HI>Gnim</HI> Hebr.) <HI>the tents of Kedar;</HI> a very great Interpreter translates it so, <HI>I dwell</HI> As <HI>the tents of Kedar.</HI> i. e. <HI>Like</HI> the inhabitants of the Stony Sun-burnt <HI>Arabia;</HI> whom in|deed I don't Remember <HI>David</HI> ever was a|mong.] Accordingly, a people have Three
<PB N="14" REF="000540_0093_0FA6B60F84ACD2B8">
Things incumbent on them, if they would en|joy the <HI>Presence</HI> of God.</P>
<P>First, A People should be <HI>with</HI> God, by <HI>Communion [With] Him.</HI> This tis to be <HI>With</HI> Him; There are Certain meanes of <HI>Communion</HI> between God and us; and <HI>these</HI> we must be continually approaching to Him in. We are <HI>With</HI> God, while we are at <HI>Pray|er</HI> before Him; hence in our Context here, it immediately follows, <HI>If you</HI> seek <HI>the Lord, He will be found of you,</HI> While we do <HI>seek</HI> Him, we are <HI>with</HI> Him. The Psalmist was a man much in prayer, and therefore he could say as in Psal. 73. 23. <HI>I am continually</HI> with <HI>thee.</HI> A people much in <HI>Prayer</HI> may say the same, <HI>We are continually</HI> with <HI>the Lord.</HI> A People that will <HI>pray</HI> upon all occasions, a people that will <HI>pray</HI> over all Businesses, a peo|that will retire into the Mount for <HI>pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">er</HI> (and <HI>Easting</HI> too) at every turn; that peo|ple is <HI>with</HI> the Lord. And the whole <HI>Wor|ship</HI> of God must be, diligently, graciously, faithfully frequented by a people that would be <HI>with</HI> Him. We are <HI>with</HI> God, when we are at <HI>His House.</HI> A people should support &amp; esteem, and use all the <HI>Ordinances of God</HI> a|mong them. The <HI>Church</HI> of God hath His very special Presence in it; the Name of the Church is that is Ezek. 48. 35. <HI>Jehovah Sham|mah,</HI> the Lord <HI>is there.</HI> We should all be <HI>there</HI>
<PB N="15" REF="000540_0094_0FA6B61049C7B920">
too, and <HI>there</HI> give those Encouragements which are due to the Institutions of God; So shall we be <HI>with</HI> the Lord.</P>
<P>Secondly, A people should be <HI>with God</HI> by <HI>Activity</HI> [For] <HI>Him.</HI> To be <HI>For</HI> God is to be <HI>with</HI> God. It was once the Summons giv|en in Exod. 32. 26. <HI>Who is one the</HI> Lords side? <HI>And all the Sons of</HI> Levi <HI>gathered themselves;</HI> they were <HI>with</HI> God in doing so. Tis a Sum|mons given to the world in every Generation, <HI>Who is on the Lords side?</HI> They that obey the Summons are <HI>with</HI> the Lord. A people full of Contrivances for the Interest of God, are <HI>with</HI> Him. A people should set themselves to advance the <HI>Glory</HI> of God; they should own His <HI>Truths,</HI> and His <HI>Wayes;</HI> and endea|vour to draw all about them into the Ac|knowledgement of the same. A people should propound the <HI>Glory</HI> of God as their cheef <HI>End</HI> and the main <HI>Scope</HI> of all that they do; and they should think much of no <HI>Cost,</HI> no <HI>Pains,</HI> nor (tho, as a Martyr once ex|pressed himself, <HI>tho every</HI> hair <HI>on their heads were a life</HI>) should a Thousand <HI>Lives</HI> be dear unto them, in the promoting of it. Then are they <HI>with</HI> the Lord; they are <HI>so,</HI> when God can say of them, as in <HI>Isa.</HI> 43. 10. <HI>Ye are my</HI> Witnesses, <HI>saith the Lord, and my ser|vant.</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly, A people should be <HI>With God,</HI> by
<PB N="16" REF="000540_0095_0FA6B61159510C70">
<HI>Behaviour</HI> [Like] <HI>Him.</HI> To be <HI>Like</HI> God is to be <HI>with</HI> God. They that are <HI>with</HI> Him, do not <HI>walk contrary</HI> to Him. God and we should be <HI>One.</HI> A people should have the same <HI>Designs,</HI> the same <HI>Desires,</HI> which the Written Edicts of Heaven declare to be in the blessed God; and not only so, but the same <HI>Vertues</HI> too. Is God <HI>Holy?</HI> Thus a peo|ple should not <HI>bear with them that are evil.</HI> Is God <HI>Righteous?</HI> Thus a people should abhor all <HI>Injustice</HI> and <HI>Oppression.</HI> Is God <HI>Merciful?</HI> Thus a people should be disposed unto all fair acts of <HI>Pitty</HI> and <HI>Kindness.</HI> Then they will be <HI>with</HI> the Lord; and, <HI>O that this people were so</HI> with <HI>Him!</HI></P>
<P>This is the USE to be now made of what has been delivered.</P>
<P>Let us all now, <HI>Be</HI> with <HI>God,</HI> that God may <HI>Be</HI> with <HI>us.</HI> I suppose, whatever else we <HI>differ</HI> in, we generally <HI>concur</HI> in that wish, I. King. 8. 27. <HI>The Lord our God be</HI> with <HI>us, as He was</HI> with <HI>our Fathers, let Him not leave us nor forsake us.</HI> O that we might all as much concur in an endeavourous Resolution, <HI>to be</HI> with <HI>God, as our</HI> Fathers <HI>were</HI> with <HI>Him; not to leave Him, nor forsake him.</HI> There is as much of <HI>New-England</HI> in this great Con|gregation as can well be reach'd by the voice of <HI>one</HI> Address; tis indeed, the best part of
