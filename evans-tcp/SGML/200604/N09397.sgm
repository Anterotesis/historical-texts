<OPENER><SALUTE>My Dear Friend,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE ob&s;erved with much &s;orrow and concern your neglect of the public wor&s;hip of God and preaching of the Go&s;pel: As you thereby deprive me of the opportunity of addre&s;&s;ing you from the pulpit, I am obliged to follow you into your private retirements: And I have cho&s;en <HI>this</HI> method of application to your con|&s;cience, becau&s;e I would give you the advantage of re|newing and reflecting upon my &s;olemn admonition, which you might be more likely to forget if I &s;hould only di&s;cour&s;e with you in per&s;on, and becau&s;e I can in this method be quite free from the infirmities and interrupt|ions which often attend per&s;onal conferences.</P>
<P>Let me then beg of you, the fir&s;t lei&s;ure hour you have, after receiving this &s;mall addre&s;s, to &s;et your&s;elf &s;eriou&s;ly and impartially to weigh in your mind the following con|&s;iderations, without taking any offence at the plain and clo&s;e manner of addre&s;s here u&s;ed, and without blaming me for repre&s;enting the truth to you in a di&s;agreeable light, &s;ince it is not <HI>my</HI> fault that I am obliged to deal with you in this manner.</P>
<P>In love and tenderne&s;s to your &s;oul, and under a &s;en&s;e of the account which I mu&s;t hereafter render to my Lord and Ma&s;ter, I will endeavour, in the fir&s;t place, to &s;how you the <HI>nature</HI> of your &s;in&mdash; then &s;et forth its <HI>aggravations</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> and the <HI>danger</HI> to which it expo&s;es you&mdash;then an&s;wer with <HI>excu&s;es</HI> as you may make in favour of it&mdash;and la&s;tly, give you a word of <HI>exhortation</HI> and <HI>warning.</HI> May the divine &s;pirit &s;et home the&s;e things on your heart, that my labour may not be in vain.</P>

to the&s;e holy de&s;ires is the temper of your &s;oul? You had rather indulge your&s;elf in &s;in, than take the lea&s;t &s;tep to|ward holine&s;s; you are content to let the precious waters of the &s;anctuary run to wa&s;te, rather than &s;toop to drink of them as they glide along: And thus your poor &s;oul is making no improvement in divine knowledge; you are loving darkne&s;s rather than light, becau&s;e your deeds are evil; and if it &s;hould ever plea&s;e God to regenerate you by his holy &s;pirit, what a &s;mall &s;tock of knowledge will you have to be a foundation for the exerci&s;e of grace, and the performance of duty in your Chri&s;tian cour&s;e! I &s;peak of your regeneration only as a <HI>po&s;&s;ible</HI> thing; but at the &s;ame time I &s;olemnly warn you, from the word of God, that &s;o long as you remain negligent of the means of grace, there is not the lea&s;t <HI>probability</HI> that God will ever change your heart, nor the lea&s;t encouragement for you to hope for his mercy. Such is the nature of your &s;in.</P>
<P N="2">II. Let me now, in the &s;econd place, repre&s;ent to you <HI>the aggravations</HI> of it. And here,</P>
<P N="1">1. It is aggravated by <HI>the greatne&s;s, excellency, and importance of the go&s;pel.</HI> If the go&s;pel, and the &s;ervice which it requires, were things indifferent, or of little im|portance, the charge again&s;t you for neglecting them would not run &s;o high; but they are things of the mo&s;t excellent nature, and of the highe&s;t importance to every degenerate &s;on and daughter of Adam. The go&s;pel is nothing le&s;s than a revelation of mercy to apo&s;tate, re|bellious, &s;elf-de&s;troyed &s;inners; yea, a revelation of the only po&s;&s;ible way in which mercy can be &s;hewed to them, con&s;i&s;tent with the eternal ju&s;tice, truth and holine&s;s of the unchangeable GOD; it teaches us the only accept|able way of wor&s;hipping and &s;erving him, by revealing to us a glorious Mediator, through whom our wor&s;hip is to be directed to God, and by who&s;e precious righteou&s;|ne&s;s we and our &s;ervices are rendered acceptable in his fight. And is not this a mo&s;t glorious and valuable di&s;|covery to fallen man?

rams, and ten thou&s;and rivers of oil, would not have been an adequate offering; Lebanon would not have been &s;ufficient to burn, nor all the bea&s;ts thereof for a burnt-offering; nothing le&s;s than the blood of the Son of God could redeem us from the cur&s;e of the law, and open the way for our re&s;toration to the favour of an offended De|ity: And this, great as it was, Chri&s;t freely offered, for the love he bore to our guilty race; and God mercifully accepted his &s;acrifice in&s;tead of our &s;ufferings, and is upon account thereof reconciling the world to him&s;elf, not im|puting to men their tre&s;pa&s;&s;es. This glorious work of redemption is a my&s;tery which the angels de&s;ire to look into, 'tis the object of their admiration; 'tis a work which will engage the attention and excite the thankful prai&s;es of the redeemed throughout eternity; yea, 'tis a work which &s;eems to be the <HI>center</HI> of all God's great de|&s;igns from everla&s;ting to everla&s;ting. Chri&s;t, the great undertaker and fini&s;her of this illu&s;trious work, com|manded it to be made known to all nations; and accord|ingly his apo&s;tles went into all the world, publi&s;hing the truth, confirming their te&s;timony with many miraculous works, and &s;ealing it with their blood. Innumerable is the company of martyrs, who, animated with the true &s;pirit of Chri&s;tianity, per&s;evered in confe&s;&s;ing their glori|ous Lord, and vindicating the divine authority of his go&s;|pel, in the mid&s;t of the &s;harpe&s;t tortures which the unre|lenting cruelty of the mo&s;t inhuman tyrants could invent; having come out of great tribulation, they have wa&s;hed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb, and they are before the throne of God, and &s;erve him day and night in his temple. Of &s;uch importance did they e&s;teem the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t, that they did not even count their lives dear to them&s;elves, &s;o that they might &s;hew their love to it, and glorify their ble&s;&s;ed Lord. And is it not of the &s;ame importance now? How can you bear then to make the compari&s;on between them and your&s;elf, while you will not pay &s;o much re&s;pect to that very go&s;pel as to hear it preached?</P>

and you know how apt your children are to imitate what they &s;ee you do; you know they learn to &s;peak, to read, to perform all the common actions of life by imitation; and do they not learn &s;in the &s;ame way?

And when they &s;ee you living in the neglect of divine wor&s;hip and ordinances, will they not be led to think them things of little or no importance? Should you take pains to teach them the nature and advantage of public wor&s;hip, and &s;end them to the hou&s;e of God; yet will they not think you intend to deceive them, &s;ince it is plain, by your conduct, that you do not e&s;teem it a matter of any great importance to your&s;elf. But if you &s;hould in any mea&s;ure withold tho&s;e in&s;tructions, and be &s;lack about their attendance, is it at all likely that they will have any inclination of their own to go? And would you <HI>chu&s;e</HI> that they &s;hould be brought up in the neglect of this duty? The like may be &s;aid of &s;ervants, and all others over whom God in his providence hath placed you.

<P N="4">4.

The wor&s;hip of God, through the Mediator, is &s;o high and honourable a priviledge allowed to guilty men, and the publick per|formance thereof is a duty &s;o rea&s;onable in it&s;elf, &s;o con|ducive to our own happine&s;s, and &s;o expre&s;ly required by God, that the neglect thereof is highly offen&s;ive in his &s;ight, and merits a &s;evere puni&s;hment at his hands. But God has &s;o ordered the con&s;titution of the moral world, that &s;in <HI>nece&s;&s;arily</HI> brings on its own puni&s;hment: Thus, the glutton, the drunkard, and the unclean, by the abu&s;e of their bodies, in the intemperate gratification of their appetites, bring on them&s;elves tho&s;e pains and mi&s;eries which are a part of their puni&s;hment. And thus, the carele&s;s go&s;pel-&s;inner, by neglecting and mi&s;improving his day of grace, and the means of &s;alvation which God richly be&s;tows upon him, puts him&s;elf out of the way of divine in&s;truction and re&s;traint, and <HI>naturally</HI> brings on him&s;elf blindne&s;s of mind and hardne&s;s of heart, than which there cannot be a more dreadful judgment. Hear what God &s;ays of his ancient people I&s;rael: <HI>My people would not hearken to my voice, and I&s;rael would none of me; &s;o I gave them up to their own hearts' lu&s;ts, and they walked in their own coun&s;el.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. lxxxi.12.</NOTE> Remember al&s;o that &s;cripture &s;o o<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">en quoted in the new te&s;tament, and applied to the Jews, who would not hearken to the voice of Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tles. <HI>Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and &s;hut their eyes; le&s;t they &s;ee with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and under&s;tand with their heart, and convert and be healed.</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">I&s;aiah vi.10.</NOTE> This is here &s;poken by way of <HI>command</HI> from God to the prophet; but as it is quoted in the new te&s;tament, it is repre&s;ented as <HI>their own fault</HI> that they were brought into &s;uch an awful con|dition. <HI>The heart of this people is waxed gro&s;s, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes have they clo&s;ed,</HI> <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Acts. xxviii.2<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE> &amp;c. which teaches us, that though blindne&s;s and hardne&s;s be judicially inflicted by God, yet they are the natural ef|fects

<P>But we find another kind of judgment threatned and inflicted by God upon per&s;ons of your character.

But &s;uppo&s;ing the offence is ju&s;t, and you have rea&s;on &s;uffi|cient for it, ought you not (at lea&s;t &s;o far as it concern<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"> your&s;elf) to forgive it, and endeavour that there may <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">e a reconciliation?

This is the way to get good; and &s;ome <HI>&s;uch</HI> hearers there are, I tru&s;t, in o<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">r con|gregation (would God the number was greater.) And if any are really profited by their attendance on this di|vine in&s;titution, it is a far greater argument to urge your compliance with your duty, than the contrary is in favour of your neglect. It is much to be wi&s;hed, tho' hardly to be expected, that all who attend the public &s;ervice of God &s;hould gain equal benefit thereby: The word preach|ed will be a &s;avour of life unto life to &s;ome, and of death unto death to others; but you are greatly mi&s;taken if you imagine your&s;elf not &s;o guilty in the &s;ight of God, as they that outwardly attend their duty, and yet are not benefited by it; you have the &s;ame advantages, the &s;ame

talent is committed to you both; and if you are both found to have mi&s;improved it, you will be reckoned with alike; nor can you expect to e&s;cape the judgment of tho&s;e that wilfully reject the &s;alvation offered in the go&s;|pel, for you cannot &s;ay that you do not know your Ma&s;ter's will, in &s;ome mea&s;ure; and if you keep your|&s;elf ignorant of any part of it, by your neglect of the means of in&s;truction, the fault is wholly your own: Wilful ignorance of duty is wilful neglect of duty, and de&s;erves the &s;ame puni&s;hment.</P>
<P N="5">5. It is pleaded by &s;ome, that <Q>they have met with misfortunes, and are &s;o melancholy and dejected in their minds that they cannot compo&s;e them&s;elves to attend upon divine &s;ervice, and therefore it is as well to omit it.</Q> This is a mo&s;t artful delu&s;ion of Satan's; and whoever is &s;ubject to it, is led captive by him at his will. Let me tell you, O unhappy creature, that you are the cau&s;e of your own mi&s;ery: When God &s;ent af|flictions to you, he meant them for your good, to make you thoughtful, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">ut not di&s;tracted; &s;erious, but not me|lancholy: Your corrupt heart has led you to counteract God's gracious de&s;igns; in&s;tead of improving your trou|bles for the good of your &s;oul, you are making them the cau&s;e of your ruin. You &s;hould have humbled your&s;elf under the mighty hand of God, ki&s;&s;ed his correcting rod, &s;ubmitted to his holy will, examined your heart and life, to &s;ee what was the cau&s;e of his contending with you; put away your provoking &s;ins, continued clo&s;e to your duty, and patiently waited for light to ari&s;e in darkne&s;s, and good to be brought out of evil: But, fir&s;t to perplex your mind with God's providential dealings, and then to make that perplexity an excu&s;e for the neglect of plain duty, is in a very high degree &s;inful; it &s;hows a prodigi|ous enmity again&s;t God in your heart; the very thought of which ought to &s;trike horror into your &s;oul, &s;ince you have joined ingratitude to di&s;obedience, and are oppo&s;ing your be&s;t friend in his kinde&s;t de&s;igns toward you. Can there be any thing more void of rea&s;on, more contrary to the cleare&s;t light of nature, than your ab&s;urd plea?

<Q>Becau&s;e you are perplexed and dejected in your mind, therefore you will not go where light and comfort are to be had.

For the Lord's &s;ake, then, do not give way any longer to &s;uch a wretched delu&s;ion; but beg of God to recover you out of this fatal &s;nare of the evil one, or you will be in the greate&s;t danger of being hurried on to utter de&s;truction.</P>
<P N="6">6. "The want of decent clothes to appear in," is &s;ometimes made an excu&s;e for neglecting the public &s;er|vice of God. Is this your plea, my friend? then be not offended if I &s;hould a&s;k you, why you are not provided with &s;uch clothes as you need? You are poor; but do you labour in any hone&s;t employment to obtain the ne|ce&s;&s;aries and conveniences of life? And do you &s;pend what you get, in a reputable way, without wa&s;ting it in gratifying your appetites beyond due bounds? If &s;o, it is &s;trange that you cannot furni&s;h your&s;elf with &s;uch apparel as is &s;uitable to your condition; and nobody would ex|pect to &s;ee you wear better. But perhaps your <HI>pride</HI> keeps you at home more than your <HI>poverty</HI>; you are re|duced, it may be, from what you once was, and cannot appear in the &s;ame manner as formerly; or, you think your&s;elf as good as your neighbours, and would make as good a &s;how as they; and becau&s;e you cannot, therefore you will not venture into the public a&s;&s;embly for God's wor&s;hip. But do you think that he regards the <HI>dre&s;s</HI> you

appear in before him? Does he look at the outward ap|pearance, or at the heart? Is it the opinion of your fel|low men that you are afraid of? What if any of them &s;hould make &s;port of, or find fault with, your dre&s;s? So long as your con&s;cience can witne&s;s that you are hone&s;t and indu&s;trious, and are not to blame for your mean ap|pearance, you have a &s;atisfaction within, &s;ufficient to for|tify you again&s;t the reproaches of fools.

<P>If it is through idlene&s;s, or carele&s;sne&s;s, or extravagance of any kind, or pride, that you cannot appear decently in public, either of the&s;e is your <HI>&s;in</HI>; and one &s;in cannot be an excu&s;e for another: Therefore it is vain to make &s;uch a Plea, for it cannot be admitted at the bar of con&s;cience or of God. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>I wi&s;h it could not ju&s;tly be urged by the</HI> inferiors <HI>in &s;ome families, that they are not able to attend, becau&s;e their pa|rents or ma&s;ters neglect to furni&s;h them with &s;uitable appa|rel, although they make a decent appearance them&s;elves.</HI></NOTE></P>
