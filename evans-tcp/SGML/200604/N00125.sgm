<Q>O that they were wise, that they understood this, that they would consider their latter end,</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>BLessed <HI>Moses</HI> that Renowned Servant of the Lord, and King in <HI>Jeshurun</HI> (having served his own Generation <HI>by the Will of God,</HI> and performed his high and honourable Undertaking in Leading and conducting that untractable &amp; rebellious People of Israel to the borders of <HI>Canaan,</HI> and after many Temptations and Exerci|ses in the Wast and Howling Desart, brought them to a fair view, and near prospect of that long promised and much desired Land) was just now ready to deliver up his trust, and resigne the weighty charge of that great Congregation unto <HI>Joshua,</HI> his servant and successor, on whom it was devolved by the immediate order and disposal of the Lord. You have in this Chapter his <GAP DESC="foreign"> <HI>His Swan like Song, or his Farewell Sermon</HI> (as I may not ineptly call it) dictated to him by the Spirit of God, and delivered by him to that people at his departure from them in|to another World: And it is a very precious and a stately portion of Scri|pture. The <HI>Hebrews</HI> say of this Song of <HI>Moses,</HI> that it is a Summary of the whole Law, wherein mention is made of Gods Magnificence, the Creation of the World, the One true God that is to be Worshipped, the Generation of the Flood, the Division of Languages and Lands, the Ele|ction and Separation of the Children of <HI>Israel</HI> for the peculiar Treasure and Inheritance of the Lord, the benefits conferred upon them in the Wilder|ness, the future Resurrection of the dead, with many other things of grand importance and concernment. You may well call it a <HI>Song of Degrees,</HI> (as <HI>David</HI> doth some of his <HI>Psalme</HI>) in respect of the superlative excel|lency of it: It is certainly a Prophetical Song, wherein we have a predi|ction, or Prophetical Declaration of what the Lord, the God of their Fa|thers, would do for that people of Israel in that good Land of <HI>Canaan;</HI> and of the manner of their demeanour and deportment of themselves there. <HI>Moses</HI> by the spirit of Prophesi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> gives us in this Chapter, as in a true Glass, the feature of that People, as it look'd in after-times. He begins the Song with a Rhetorical &amp; pathetical Apostrophe, wherein there is a most solemn
<PB N="2" REF="000180_0007_0FA315D2876E4860">
and weighty contestation or appeal to Heaven and Earth, importing the deafness and stupidity of his hearers (that he had as good apply his speech to sensless and inanimate Creatures as to them) and the great con|cernment of what he had to speak, as fit and worthy that Heaven and Earth and all the World should hearken to it. After his <HI>Exordium, Proem</HI> or <HI>Preface,</HI> wherein he labours to procure Benevolence, Attention and Docility: You have,</P>
<P N="1">1. A Narrative, wherein he commemorates the great benefits which had been, and were to be conferred onthat people, from <HI>ver.</HI> 4. to 15. The Lord took special care in the first division of the habitable parts of the World, that there might be an Inheritance laid out for the Children of <HI>Israel,</HI> and assigned the Land of <HI>Canaan</HI> to them, <HI>ver.</HI> 8. He singled them out for his peculiar people, <HI>ver.</HI> 9. he conducted them graciously in the Wilderness, <HI>ver.</HI> 10. and afforded them not only safe conduct in the way, but also wholsome Instructions in his Laws and Commandments, <HI>ibid.</HI> He granted them protection from the many dangers they were exposed unto, and was as tender and careful of them as a man is of the Apple of his Eye, or the <HI>Eagle</HI> of her young ones, <HI>ver.</HI> 10, 11. He made comforta|ble provision for them in their Journey, introduced them into that Land flowing with <HI>Milk and Honey,</HI> confirmed and settled them in Possession and Fruition of the good things of it, <HI>ver.</HI> 13,14. <HI>Moses</HI> mentions and records in this Song (which was appointed of the Lord to be written and taught the Children of <HI>Israel,</HI> that it might be a Song of Witness for the Lord against them, <HI>Deut.</HI> 31. 19.) these and other loving kindnesses of the Lord.</P>
<P N="2">2. A Prediction of the Apostacy, Idolatry and horrible Ingratitude of <HI>Israel,</HI> from <HI>ver.</HI> 15. to 19. They would be so far from rend<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ing again unto the Lord according to the benefits done unto them in that good Land, that they would requite him evil for good, and load him with their sins, [<HI>Amos</HI> 2. 13] as he loaded them with his benefits. All those Cords of a Man and Bands of Love with which the <HI>L </HI> ord drew them to himself, would not hold them or bind them fast unto him: but they quickly snapt all a|sunder, and broke loose from all engagements, and rushed on prodigiously and desperately in wayes of Provocation and Rebellion.</P>
<P N="3">3. A severe Commination of deserved Chastisements and Punishments, from <HI>ver.</HI> 19, <HI>to</HI> 36.</P>
<P N="4">4. A Word of Consolation Administred unio them: from <HI>ver.</HI> 36, <HI>to</HI> 42. When they should have sinned themselves into a deplorable condi|tion, so that all Humane helps and hopes failed, and their case in appea|rance

and to the eye of reason was desperate: God would then awake and arise and plead their cause against insolent and injurious Adversaries, and glorifie himself in their deliverance. He would certainly preserve alive <HI>an Holy Seed, a Remnant in the worst times,</HI> and shew himself faith|ful and bountiful, even to an undeserving people</P>
<P N="5">5. The Conclusion of the song, wherein he predicts the multiplicati|on of the Church, and enlargment of the Kingdom of Christ, and ex|horts the remna<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t of <HI>Israel</HI> to praise God for their deliverance from their Babylonian Captivity; and the pious converted Gentiles for the ven|geance executed upon the <HI>Mystical Babylon,</HI> that had detained them in spiritual bondage; and especially for the expiation of their sins by Je|sus Christ which is by many Expositors, wise, and judicious, apprehen|ded to be the sense and importance of the 43. <HI>verse.</HI></P>
<P>Now in that part of the song which is <HI>Comminatory,</HI> and includes my Text, the Lord acquaints them by the hand of <HI>Moses</HI> with those dreadfull and almost unparalel'd judgments and calamities (Temporal as well as Spiritual<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> that should be inflicted and executed on the account of their intol|lerable Provocations: yet not to a total and universal destruction and de|solation. Though their sins were such as deserved utter extirpation and ruine, and their provocations of greivous and unsufferable that the Lord was ready to resolve to dissipate and blow them away, and make the re|membrance of them to cease from among men&punc; <HI>ver.</HI> 26. yet the clemency and goodness and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of the Lord's anger in the exec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ution of his thr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">mings should appear in the preservation of a remnant the impul|sive cause whereof is intimated to be the consideration of the <HI>Wrath and Insolence of the Adversary, and the Dishonour that would redound to the Name of God thereby,</HI> ver. 27. which is amplified by the Antithesis of the Impulsive cause that might have moved him <HI>to destroy them utterly, ver.</HI> 28. God renders the reason of his severe proceedings against them, why he heaped <HI>so many mischiefs</HI> and spent <HI>so many Arrows upon them, ver.</HI> 23. an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> was almost ready to <HI>blot out the Name and Memory of that People;</HI> namely this, <HI>Because their folly was Incureable.</HI> For he doth not only signifie in those words, that they did inconsiderately <HI>rush forward in wayes of sin,</HI> and <HI>precipitate themselves into misery, because they wanted the actual exercise of judgement and sound reason:</HI> but that they acted at such a rate, a <HI> s</HI> if there were not the least Drop or Dram of spiritual Wis|dome in their hearts, nor a possibility in the course of ordinary means of reducing them <HI>ad sanam mentem,</HI> as judicious <HI>Calvin</HI> observes upon the place. Thereupon we have in the Words <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ead, a Pathetical Exclama|tion,
<PB N="4" REF="000180_0009_0FA315D406708F40">
wherein the Lord (after the manner of men) passionately expresseth his desire that <HI>they would be spiritually wise to consider what would become of them, if they held on their course of sinning against the Lord:</HI> what would be the sad end and issue of their Rebellions against <HI>the God of their mer|cies.</HI> I know indeed that some understand these words, <HI>ver.</HI> 28, 29. as spoken of the Enemies of <HI>Israel.</HI> As if the Lord had said: <HI>If they were wise in deed, they would not say our band is high and the Lord hath not done all this as</HI> ver. 27. <HI>nor attribute and ascribe their prosperous and victorious Proceedings, and the destructions they bad brought upon</HI> Israel <HI>to their own prowess and policy, but would easily understand that God had delivered up his People to misery and destruction for their sins.</HI> Yea, and they would consider also their own latter end, that is, what end remaineth for them|selves also, even the like destruction for their great Abominations impeni|tently persisted in. But we have no reason to recede from the received common Interpretation of the Words, or question their immediate Ap|plication to the People of <HI>Israel.</HI> The Words are plainly spoken of <HI>Is|rael, the peculiar People of God, in a condition of great degeneracy:</HI> wherein the Lord intimates and expresseth.</P>
<P N="1">1. The ground and occasion of that Misery and Ruine that was come|ing upon them, namely, their want of Counsel and Understanding, <HI>ver.</HI> 28. The misery that befel them at several seasons in these and those Ge|nerations was not either undeserved or accidental: but as the hand of God inflicted it in a way of just severity, so their incurable Folly and Un|reasonableness was the meritorious cause that brought it upon them.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Cure, the Help, the only Remedy, or rather, that which would have saved them and secured their Nation, with all the concernments of it from those Ruines, and prevented such a sad issue and calamitous event, namely, Wisdome, <HI>ver.</HI> 29. which is in the words of the Text, amplified from the Act and Object thereof.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> The Act of this Wisdome: and that is double,</P>
<P N="1">1. To Understand. <HI>Oh that they were wise, that they understood this.</HI> The Word so translated signifies also to prosper, and to make prosperous: because though men of Understanding are not alwayes, yet they are or|dinarily prosperous, their counsels and actions are usually attended and waited on with success. The Word therefore may import a prosperous, successful, right understanding of things. Yet it signifies an acute and subtle and accurate understanding, with an intense and industrious exer|cise of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, and is contrary to a word [<HI>Chasal</HI> or <HI>Sachal</HI>] that signifies incognitancy, or idle levity in the managing of things as <HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">agwine</HI>
<PB N="5" REF="000180_0010_0FA315D4C50AE4C0">
observes. And considering the Conjugation wherein it is used, it signi|fies, to make (that is, to make themselves) to understand. Gods donation of this wisdome and understanding excludes not, but supposes our endea|vours to acquire it.</P>
<P N="2">2. To Consider: The Original word hath Affinity with <HI>Banah</HI> (as <HI>Avenarius</HI> notes) which signifies <HI>to build.</HI> A man of consideration must be like a wise <HI>Architect</HI> that disposes in his minde, contrives, conceives, models, frames and casts the several parts of his Fabrick or building. To consider is to cast, and conceive, and get the model or idea, the Platform (as it were) of this or that Object in our minds. And it notes a judicious, fixed or abiding dijudication of things.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> The Object of this Wisdome, Understanding and Conside|ration: and that is, <HI>their latter End. End</HI> in this place noteth not the final cause (as when we say, the last end of man is to glorifie God) but the <HI>exitus,</HI> the term, the issue, the upshot, the event and the conclusion of those sinful wayes they were engaged in. As when it is said <HI>the end of some way that seemeth right unto a man (are the wayes of death: and the end of some mirth is heaviness, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Prov.</HI> 14. 12,13. the wisdome of that people should have exprest it self in understanding and considering the latter end of their wayes. Not so much <HI>finis operantis,</HI> the end intended by themselves; as <HI>finis operis,</HI> the end of their wayes and doings, the scope, and tendency, and issue of their evil and unworthy deportments should have been considered by them.</P>
<P>I shall only adde, that the form of this expression in the Text is <HI>opta|tive; O that they were wise,</HI> &amp;c. we meet with the like form of speech, and mode of expression attributed to God in other places of Scripture. As <HI>Psal.</HI> 81. 13. <HI>O that my People had hearkened unto me, and Israel had wal|ked in my wayes,</HI> and Isai. 48. 18. <HI>O that thou hadst hearkened to my Com|mandments,</HI> &amp;c. the like occurs in other places. There is indeed some difficulty in it; For you will say,</P>
<P>Obj. <HI>How can the Lord be said to wish this? He could have made them wise, and understanding, and considering men and women, if it had been his good will and pleasure. How can wishing and woulding be attributed to God in respect of those things which are never accomplished? How can such a veli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ity be ascribed to God without the impeachment of his wisdome, and power, and constancy, and blessedness.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> This and the like expressions are spoken of God <GAP DESC="foreign"> after the manner of men, and must be understood <GAP DESC="foreign"> in a
<PB N="6" REF="000180_0011_0FA315D587340268">
manner becoming the glorious Nature and Being of God. It is mani|festly an expression borrowed from the manner of men, lamenting the rashness, the folly, the inconsiderateness of their Children, and their want of understanding, their wayes and the issue of them. And yet we must understand, and take it up in a manner becoming and comporting with the perfect nature of the blessed God. The Lord doth not really and properly carry himself, as a Father that stands wringing his hands over a prodigal Son, and saith, <HI>O that thou wouldst be wise, that thou wouldst un|derstand thy self, that thou wouldst consider what these prodigal courses will come to at last,</HI> what will be the end of thy Drunkenness, thy Lacivious|ness, thy Company keeping, thy great Idleness, and vain expence of pre|cious Time, Estate and Strength in this manner! O that thou wouldst be|think thy self and consider what will be the issue of these lewd wayes and courses! the poor afflicted Father may wish and desire it; but hath not power to give such an heart: but God alone can do it. If the Lord had willed properly with the will of purpose, or decreed that <HI>Israel</HI> should be wise to understand and consider their latter end, he both could and would have conferred upon them that wisdome, and prudent consideration of it; and that without any impeachment of or detriment to the liberty of their wills. It is at first sight a strange expression which we meet with; <HI>Deut.</HI> 5 29. <HI>O that there were such an heart in them, that they would fear me,</HI> &amp;c. In the Original it is (word for word) <HI>Who will give that their heart may be such in them.</HI> as Mr.<HI>Ainsworth</HI> reads it. Why doth God need to ask the question: <HI>who will give them such an heart?</HI> He knows that none but himself can give such an heart, and that he can effectually give it: and he knows whether he hath determined to give it or not. And therefore the expression must be understood after the manner of men. It is evident to any under standing man, that these things cannot be spoken&punc; of God pro|perly and rigorously (as the <HI>Arminians</HI> absurdly strain them) <HI>salva Ma|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">estate Divina.</HI> But we must say, <HI>cum toto Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ologorum Choro</HI> (as judicious <HI>Ames</HI> speaks) that God in such forms of speech, that he may commodi|ously treat with man, doth <HI>induerese homine,</HI> put on Man (as it were) o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> vest himself in the condition and properties of man, and propose his coun|sels to us in such a way wherein we may best apprehend them, and they may be most familiarized to us.

God doth not do and undo, and thereby contradict and deny himself: He doth not Decree not to confer this wisdome, and then wish there had been no such Decree to hinder the communication of that wisdome; He doth not give the Rational Crea|ture such an absolute and uncontrolable liberty of will, that he cannot bend and encline their will to what he will, and then repent, and wish that he had otherwise constituted the frame of their Rational Faculties: But if you divest the expression of that <HI>Anthropopathy</HI> that is in it, there are these and such like things imported therein.</P>
<P N="1">1. A Graphical and Emphatical Expression of their want of wisdome and counsel, understanding and consideration. They were not spiritually wise, nor was it in their power to understand aright, or consider duely their latter end.

<P N="2">2. That it was their duty to be so wise, <HI>as to understand and consider their latter end.</HI> Gods wishing this doth not necessarily import and ar|gue the Creatures power, but their duty&punc; not that they <HI>can</HI> of themselves, but that they <HI>ought</HI> to be thus wise. Their duty is hereby indigitated; that they ought to wish, and desire, and aspire after those things, which God (speaking after the manner of men) wisheth for them; and that it is their great fault if they neglect their duty herein.</P>
<P N="3">3. That it is their interest and the wisest course they can fix upon wisely <HI>to mind and consider their latter end.</HI> It would be really good for them|selves, and the best way to prevent misery and ruine.

<P N="5">5. That the want of this was the great cause of their rushing on pro|digiously in a course of sin into misery.

<P N="6">6. That this is the first and good step towards the repentance and re|formation of a degenerous, backsliding and rebellious People, to consider what they are doing, whither they are going, and what the end of their wayes will be at last.</P>
<P N="7">7. The nature of the Word of God and the dispensation thereof is signi|fied hereby, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> that it doth instantly perswade men to get this wisdom and understanding and considering spirit, or wise consideration of the Event and Issue of their ways and doings.

<P>But <HI>I</HI> shall not detain you longer in the general Explication of the Text, or Solution of these or those Difficulties. The sum &amp;result of all is; <HI>Israel</HI> was a People of many mercies and singular enjoyments (none like unto them) but withal of great provocations by their Apostacy, <HI>I </HI> dolatry, and other grievous miscarriages: and the Lord represents it here as their wisdome to consider rationally and judiciously what would be the sad and doleful issue thereof.</P>
<P>The Observation is plainly this:</P>
<P>Doct. That it is the great wisdome of a People that have been conducted by the Mighty Hand of God to a place of Rest and Liberty, and set|led in the possession of singular Priviledges and enjoyments, to under|stand

and consider, or understandingly to consider what will be the latter end of their sinful wayes, their unsuitable and unworthy deportments before the Lord.</P>
<P>The People of <HI>Israel</HI> were in Covenant with God, peculiarly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">avoured and accepted of him: And in pursuance of his Covenant engagements he had delivered them out of hard bondage, and carried them in his Arms to <HI>Canaan,</HI> a Land of rest, and liberty, and glorious enjoyments, where they quickly trespassed and rebelled grievously against him (accor|ding to the prediction of <HI>Moses in this Prophetical Song</HI>) and the Lord in the words of the Text plainly intimates it to be the wisdome of that People (and by parity of reason, of any other People that may be paralleld with them) at such a juncture, and in such a condition, to understand and consider (or to <HI>consider with Consideration,</HI> as the Original hath it signifi|cantly, <HI>Jer. 23. 20.) what will be the latter end of their sinful and rebellious wayes.</HI> Tho Lord tells, that People in the place but now mentioned, when he was about to bring a dreadful storm of wrath upon them, <HI>that in the latter dayes they should consider it perfectly.</HI> Surely then it would have been their great wisdome to consider it, in the former dayes, before the storm came, and the wrath of God arose against them, so that there was no remedy. Hence the Lord expostulates with the <HI>Jews,</HI> and calls them to a serious consideration of the end and issue of the general corruptions, and great evils found among them, <HI>Ier.</HI> 5. 30. <HI>The Prophets proph<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">sie falsly, and the Priests bear rule by their means, and my People love to have it so: And what will ye do in the end thereof?</HI> when Prophets, Priests (or Prin|ces) and People were so extreamly bad, so wofully corrupt and faulty, it was time for them to look about them, and consider what would become of them at last. It is the guise and character of a Fool, <HI>Prov.</HI> 17. 24. <HI>to have his eyes in the ends of the Earth, gazing and wandring about, looking hither and thither, far enough from his own concernments:</HI> But it is an act of wisdome in any People, especially such a People as <HI>Israel;</HI> and the pro|perty of wise persons to have their eyes fixed upon the end of their wayes and walkings.

<P><HI>Reas.</HI> 1. Because it is the great act of Wisdome to deduce, and regu|larly to inferre one thing from another. And so one of the <HI>Jewish Do|ctors</HI> saith, that <GAP DESC="foreign"> is <HI>when things are rationally collected from things, and one thing deduced from another.</HI> Sapience or Wisdome properly be|longs to <HI>Syllogistical Judgement,</HI> and is a virtue of the Understanding, whereby a man discerns the dependance of things, and how one follows upon another. To <HI>consider understandingly what will be the End of these or those wayes,</HI> imports in it a laying of things together in a Syllogistical way. Hence when men reason amiss, and conclude that which is not virtually contained in the Premises, or make wrong inferences, they are said to Paralogize themselves. <HI>Be ye doers of the word</HI> (saith the Apostle, <HI>Jam.</HI> 1. 22.) <HI>and not hearers onely,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign">. We are con|stant hearers of the Word, and waiters upon the Ordinances of God; therefore we are certainly in a good condition. The Apostle calls this a Paralogism, Sophistical Reasoning, and unsound Argumentation, where|with many Professors are wont to cheat themselves. So, <HI>We are Abra|ham's children,</HI> a people in Covenant with God, and we have his Temple,
<PB N="12" REF="000180_0017_0FA315DA04E7A550">
and Worship, and Ordinances among us: therefore though we indulge to sin, and do these and those abominations, yet God will dwell among us, and we shall do well enough. These are lying words, false inconse|quential Inferences, and foolish Reasonings. But to syllogize aright con|cerning <HI>the End of these and those wayes,</HI> is an act of Wisdome indeed. This is the work of Conscience, when it relates to the Moral actions of a man, and the issue of them; and it belongs to <HI>Syllogistical Judgement. This</HI> will follow upon <HI>that;</HI> this will be the <HI>certain Consequent of such an Antecedent;</HI> this will be the <HI>Conclusion</HI> resulting from <HI>those Premises.</HI> Wisdome lyes in the <HI>Rational Application</HI> of general Rules of Scripture to our selves and our own conditions, and in the <HI>induction of particulars,</HI> and due Reasoning from it: <HI>This hath been the End of such and such wayes, to these and those persons</HI> (witness Scripture and Experience) <HI>therefore will be so of mine also.</HI> The End is virtually in the way, as the Conclusion in the Premises. To consider and finde out this, and reason aright in this mat|ter, is an act of great wisdome and judgement.</P>
<P><HI>Reas.</HI> 2. <HI>Because it is the unquestionable duty of any people, especially such a people, to consider their latter End.</HI> What the Lord wisheth they might do, and would do, was their undoubted duty to do: and it is certainly the great wisdome of any person or people, to do their duty. There can be no greater wisdome then to conform to, and comply with every part of the revealed will of God. The Lord calls aloud upon that people of <HI>Israel</HI> again and again to <HI>consider their wayes,</HI> Haggai 1. 5,7. that is, the sad fruit and issue of them. Their building their <HI>own houses,</HI> and pur|suing their private Interests and Advantages, with the shameful neglect of <HI>publick Temple-work,</HI> was attended and followed with a visible Blast|ing Curse of God upon their Labours and Enjoyments; and he com|mands them to <HI>consider it&punc;</HI> It is the duty of a person or people, because God hath commanded it; and it is their wisdome to attend it, because what God commands is for their good; as <HI>Moses</HI> intimates to them, <HI>Deut.</HI> 10. 13.

The great enquiry of any wise man, when he is about to lift up his hand to any Enterprize, and ready to en|gage in this or that business, will be, <HI>Cui bono?</HI> To what purpose? what benefit will redound and ac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">rue thereby? <HI>Interest</HI> and <HI>Advantage</HI> is wont to lead men captive, and to influence them marvellously: and there is ordinarily no surer way to prevail with them, then by arguing <HI>ab Utili,</HI> and demonstrating the advantagiousness and expediency of any course or duty. Hence the Lord, when he would reason his people into a Care and Conscience of universal obedience to his Commandments in general, argues from this Topick or Head of Argument, <HI>Ut tibi ben&egrave; sit, That it may go well with thee,</HI> Deut. 4. 40.&mdash;5. 29.&mdash;6. 3,18.&mdash;12. 28. So may I reason in this case from the profit and advantage of such a course of con|sideration. A person or people do consult their own good, singular advantage in it. Hereby they may come to <HI>understand the signs of the Times,</HI> the want of which skill our Saviour taxeth severely, <HI>Matth.</HI> 16. 2,3. Men are usually wise to discern the signs of the Weather, and can probably conjecture when it will be fair, and when it will be foul Wea|ther: but this is Wisdome indeed, to understand and discern the dispen|sations of God, in a way of <HI>Mercy</HI> or <HI>Judgement,</HI> beforehand, and to know what God is doing, or about to do with them. As men can by the Aspect of the Sky prognosticate what Weather it will be: so they may be able to <HI>make a Judgement</HI> of their condition, and what is like to become of them, by the Aspect of their own wayes and deportments towards the Lord. Hereby they may know what to expect from the Lord, whether Mercy or Judgement, according to the ordinary Rule and Tenour of Gods dispensations. Hereby they may be awakened to Repentance, and the casting away or turning from those iniquities and transgressions that are otherwise sure to be their Ruine, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 18. 30,31.

they may be quickned and helped to <HI>meet God, when he is coming forth in the way of his Judgements,</HI> in a way of Humiliation and Supplication, <HI>Amos</HI> 4. 12. and to <HI>wait for him in the way of his Judgements,</HI> Isa. 26. 8.

there is a succenturiation or succession of men in their places of the like Spirit, Principles and Abilities. This is because <HI>the Lord our God hath loved our Israel,</HI> a Chron. 9. 8.

The mercy of the Lord hath compassed about his People that have trusted in him. Deliverances have been commanded seasonably, and no weapon formed against us hath prospered. God hath found us in this Desart Land, and compassed us about, <HI>and kept us as the Apple of his Eye,</HI> Deut. 32. 10. And all that have attempted to devour you have offended, <HI>and evil hath come upon them:</HI> just as it was with the Adversa|ries of <HI>Israel,</HI> Jer. 2. 3. God hath scattered his favours, and dealt out his blessings with a liberal hand to you: <HI>Having blessed you in basket and store,</HI> &amp; raised you up to some considerableness in the World from low be|ginnings.

So me thinks the Lord Jesus is this day standing above, beholding us from the height of his glory, and saying, Oh that my dear people in <HI>New England</HI> (whom I have peculiarly loved, and pitied, and protected, and blessed,) <HI>were wise, and would consider understandingly and rationally what the end of their sinful deportments before me will be at last.</HI> I hope he doth not adde; <HI>But now this wisdom is bid from their eyes.</HI></P>
<P>I confess I was under some temptation to have singled out such a Sub|ject in the Discussion or Handling whereof some general Christian Duties might have been commended to this great Assembly (so considerable as to the quality and publick capacity, as well as numerousness of the Au|ditors,) to have declined all such Discourses as might seem to grate, or re|flect blame, and bear too hard upon these or those. I would not have the Ministers of Christ needlesly to tamper or intermeddle with State affairs, or direct and dictate to Rulers, and intrude themselves into such things as are out of their sphere, and forreign to their calling and profession, unless upon insuperable occasions. I have seen much evil and inconvenience in it elsewhere: I would not pass the bounds, or go beyond he line of my

calling and commission from Jesus Christ. <HI>Trectent Fabrilia Fabri.</HI></P>
<P>Moreover I have considered (as a Discouragement from attempting any thing in this kind) that I am much a stranger to the Spirits, and Prin|ciples, and Practises of men in this Country, and greatly unacquainted with the state of affairs among you, and that it is no easie matter to gain thorough and certain information. And that good caution also came to minde, as a seasonable <HI>memento,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign"> <HI>a Stranger must be no needless medler.</HI> I considered also, that where men are in a di|vided posture, and their hearts are hot within them, there is small hope of doing any good. To what purpose is it to charm <HI>deaf Adders?</HI> such are men usually that are addicted to sides and parties: they are deaf on one side, and cannot hear of that ear. If a man had the meekness and gravity, and Fatherly spirit and affection that <HI>Moses</HI> discovers in the Book of <HI>Deuteronomie,</HI> the Wisdome and Reason on <HI>Solomon</HI> or <HI>Paul,</HI> the Tongue and Eloquence of <HI>Isaiah,</HI> the best accomplishments of any Son of <HI>Adam:</HI> yet it would in reason signifie little, where he hath to do with the ignorance, the pride, the perverseness, the conceitedness, the prejudi|ces, the opinionativeness of engaged men. Many good men, though in no good frame, are too like him in the Comedy, that said <GAP DESC="foreign"> <HI>Aristoph. Plut. Thou shalt not perswade me, no, though thou dost per|swade me.</HI> I considered also that things are run much to ruine among us, and gone beyond man, (the counsel and help of man) and that it must be <GAP DESC="foreign"> God alone in some more then ordinary way of working that can retrive the Interest of Christ among us, and reduce us again. Probable it is, that it must be some sharp affliction, some smarting rod, or sore tryal that must come upon these Churches to reduce them generally to their old trembling frame of spirit at the Word of God, and humble submission to the dispensation of it: And there is great reason to conceive that many Professors may be grown Sermon proof, that we had as good preach to the Heavens and Earth, and direct our discourse to the Walls and Seats and Pillars of the meeting house, and say, Hear, O ye Walls, give ear O ye Seats and Pillars, as to many men in these Church|es, that are deaf to all that is cried in their ears by the Lords Messengers, and are indeed like Rocks in the Sea, not to be stirred and moved by the beating and dashing of these waters of the Sanctuary, or by the strongest gust of rational and affectionate discourse that can blow upon them. I considered also that there may be too many, even in the Bosome of New|English Churches that have lived long in that great sin of confronting

<P>However having this oportunity, unsought and undesired by me, nay thrust upon me, I shall adventure (as God shall assist) to speak something to the present case and condition of the Country: If weakly and unad|visedly in any respect, I beg pardon of God and of his People; And if the Lord help to any words of wisdome; I know wisdome will be justi|fied of its Children, whoever condemn it, and I shall deliver my own soul, and express my compassion to the souls of others, and my faithfulness to the Interest of Christ in <HI>New-England,</HI> and those that will not hear shall be inexcusable.

How few <HI>watch and keep their garments, and gird up the loins of their minds, that walk and are not faint, run, and are not weary in the wayes of God?</HI> Not but that there are yet (through the great mercy of God) many, very many living, thriving, waking, powerful Christians among us, that have <HI>another spirit, and follow God fully</HI> (as <HI>Caleb</HI> did, <HI>Numb.</HI> 14. 24.) <HI>whose souls follow hard after God</HI> (as the speaks, <HI>Psa.</HI> 63. 8) <HI>and that walk with him with much exactness, according to the tenour of the Covenant, with whom the Lord is well pleased, and for whose sakes it fares the better with us at this day.</HI> But what shall we say of the Body of Profes|sors among us?

<P N="2">2. <HI>Consider what will be the latter end of the great contempt of and un|fruitfulness under the Dispensation of the Word and Ordinances among us.</HI> Do not your own Consciences tell you, that the Market and Price of Or|dinances is very low at this day? Houses and Lands, Lots and Farms, and outward accomodations are of more value with many people, then the Gospel and Gospel-ordinances. When the Ark of God was taken, it, was the sad lamentation of that good Woman, <HI>the Glory is departed from Israel:</HI> and she named her Son <HI>lehabod,</HI> that is, <HI>where is the glory?</HI> 1 Sam. 4. 21. 22. As if she had said, you tell me of the Birth of a Son; but where is <HI>the Glory of Israel?</HI> you shew me a Son indeed, but can you shew me the <HI>Glory?</HI> no alass! <HI>the Glory is departed from Israel, for the Ark of God is taken. The Ark of God</HI> was the glory in her eyes. But how many a|mong us are there to whom Flocks, and Herds, and Earthly Enjoyments are Glory (as they were to <HI>Labans</HI> Sons, Gen. 31. 1.) rather then the <HI>Ark of God's presence and his Holy Ordinances?</HI> where is that love to the Word, that affection to Sacraments, that longing for Sabbaths and Lecture dayes, that holy care to prepare for a meeting with God at such times, and to improve them, that was wont to be among us? Oh that old love, and zeal, and affection to the Ordinances and Messengers of Christ, though it abideth (blessed be God) with some still, is much aba|ted and lost, as to the generality of Professors in this Country. How <HI>Beautiful</HI> have the <HI>Feet</HI> of those that brought the <HI>Glad tidings of the Go|spel</HI> been? but now how <HI>burdensome?</HI> that Ministers are reckoned <HI>Bills of Charges,</HI> and were it not for shame, I doubt some people could be well enough without them, or would entertain and set up <HI>any piece of igno|rance and confidence</HI> (that would be <HI>cheap</HI> enough) to dispense the Ora|cles of God, and the Holy Mysteries of Religion unto them, rather then to be at the charge to procure and provide for men of Worth and A|bility. This very thing would make one fear that <HI>New England</HI> hath seen its best dayes: nor is it to be wondred at, if this undervalua|tion of the Ordinances of God be attended with great unfruitfulness.

May not that be the issue of these differences, that Adherence to a party, or to be a Darling of the Faction, will become as passant a Qualification with this or that party or Faction for admission into the Church of God, as visible Saint-ship hath been among us?

When you should be blessing God that you agree so far, you are wrangling because that you disagree a little: when you should thank God that you agree so much, you quarrel because you agree no more.

<P>There are the same Out-cries in Churches also for their Liberties. And God forbid but that out Brethren should enjoy the Priviledge and liber|ty which Christ hath conferred upon them.

not see this, And just it is that those that will not obey them in the Lord that have the rule over them, should be thus enslaved to the imperious and uncertain Humours of these and those usurping Brethren. And it is to be feared, that many of our Brethren (such is their weakness, and the power of prejudice) will never come humbly and kindly to submit them|selves in the Lord to the Government as Jesus Christ in his Church, till they have been soundly scratched with this <HI>Bramble Government</HI> of some aspiring and domineering Brethren. But I beseech you, Observe the mis|chief of this practise. It is a staple Principle of our ablest <HI>Congregational, men</HI> that as there is a liberty and priviledge appertaining to the Brethren; so the Rule and Government (properly so called) is appropriated to the Elders by the appointment of Jesus Christ. Now the Promise and Bles|sing goes with the Institution. So that where the Elders are in effect set by, and three or four heady Brethren lead the Church and rule all: They are in such Administrations under the wing and shadow of no promise or bles|sing which to a gracious heart is a dreadful consideration. Again the loud Out-cry of some is for <HI>Liberty of Conscience:</HI> that they may hold and practise what they will in Religion. This is the <HI>Diana</HI> of some men, and <HI>great is the Diana of the Libertines of this age.</HI> I remember <HI>Julian</HI> the <HI>Apostate,</HI> that malicious and implacable Enemy to Christianity have ob|served that the <HI>Christian Religion</HI> prospered the more for the severe per|secution in <HI>Di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">clesian's</HI> Time; and that the <HI>Christians</HI> grew up thicker and faster for being Mowed down with the <HI>Sythe</HI> of <HI>Bloody Enemies;</HI> He did for a while abstain from severities against the <HI>Christians,</HI> and suffe|red all men to use what Religion they would: And <HI>Austin</HI> saith of it, <HI>Li|bertatem perditionis permisit,</HI> He gave men liberty to destroy themselves. Such is that liberty of Conscience, even a liberty of Perdition, that some men are so unconscionably Clamorous for. But remember, that as long as you have liberty to walk in the Faith and Order of the Gospel, and may <HI>lead quiet and peaceable lives in all Godliness and Honesty,</HI> you have as much liberty of Conscience as <HI>Paul</HI> desired under any Government, 1. <HI>Tim.</HI> 2. 1, 2.

God is to be trusted with the preservation of thy Life: wilt thou not therefore in Case of Ilness, bleed and vomit, and purge out the peccant and noxious humours? God is to be trusted for the preservation of thy Corn in the Field, when it is growing up: wilt thou not therefore weed thy Corn, and take away what offends, and hinders the thriving of it? If it be replied; But this is no means of God's Appointment. Magistrates have nothing to do with matters of Religion, to interpose and exercise their coercive power in and about the things of God. I Answer. This is a meer begging of the Que|stion, and was never yet proved. But I must not dispute or further expa|tiate here.

You have done very well for the <HI>Reverend President.</HI> I beseech that the <HI>Fel|lows</HI> may be remembred also: that there may be a competent, comforta|ble, and certain allowance made for their <HI>Encouragement,</HI> who are, next to the <HI>President,</HI> the <HI>Props</HI> and <HI>Pillars of that Society,</HI> and have a c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">reful and <HI>Laborious Life</HI> of it.

on their Foundations to support and cherish and go forward with what they have begun, and <HI>to carry it on to greater perfection.</HI> Otherwise who sees not what ignorance, and Rudeness, and Barbarism will come in like a Floud upon us? Where there is a contempt or neglect of Learning there is a degeneracy from the Primitive Spirit and Way, as you call it.</P>
<P N="12">12. Lastly, <HI>Consider what will be the Latter End of that great neglect of the Rising Generation among us.</HI> The Word in my Text, which so tran|slated <HI>Latter End [Acharith]</HI> is sometimes rendred posterity: as <HI>Psal.</HI> 109 13. <HI>Let [Acharitho] his Posterity be cut off.</HI> It is the very same word with that in the Text, which is rendred <HI>Latter End.</HI> And it would be happy if we <HI>could be wise to understand this, to consider</HI> Posterity. We make very solemn Complaints to God, and one to Another of the Dege|neracie of the Rising Generation. But are not we to blame? Do we not grievously neglect them? to instruct them, to cherish and promote any good in them, to <HI>go before them</HI> with a <HI>gracious Example,</HI> to <HI>watch over them</HI> according to the mind of Christ? we teach them, (I am afraid) by our <HI>Examples</HI> to sleight <HI>Magistrates,</HI> to <HI>reproach</HI> and <HI>vilify Ministers,</HI> to be <HI>proud,</HI> and <HI>worldly,</HI> and <HI>Factious,</HI> and <HI>Contentious:</HI> as if we meant to leave <HI>Contention for an Inheritance</HI> to our Children, and to provide for the <HI>perpetuation</HI> of our <HI>Brabbles</HI> and <HI>Divisions</HI> to <HI>succeeding Generations.</HI> As if men were so such in love with Contention, that it were not enough for them to contend while they live, but they had a mind to do it when they are dead: I mean to transmit and make over their Strifes and Varian|ces, and Emulations, and Wraths, and Divisions, and petty-Enmities to after Ages; And so to contend and quarrel, in respect of the vertue and influence of their Example, to the end for the World. But alas! <HI>What good do we do them?</HI> Our Children are little beholden to us. We own them so far as to baptize them: But then Fare ye well, Children, we have nothing more to do with you. This is (as a wise Man said ingeniously) <HI>just as you are wont to Brand you Cattel, and then turn them into the woods:</HI> Or as the <HI>Popish Priests in the</HI> Indies <HI>drive scores of</HI> Indians <HI>to the Water, and Baptize them,</HI> and set down so many for Christian Converts they have made, and then let them run wild into the Woods again to their old <HI>Pa|gan courses.</HI> I fear God is angry with us on this account. Certainly some|thing should be done. If we are not agreed in all particulars, as to the way and manner and other circumstances: yet let us practise so far as we have attained; and Fast and Pray, and Consult the Scriptures, and dis|course out things in a Brotherly way (without Heats and Animosities) and wait upon God for the further and fuller Discovery of his mind to us,
<PB N="59" REF="000180_0064_0FA31547C6D8F1E8">
and be willing that Truth should be Truth, how contrary soever to any of our apprehensions. Sad it is to consider how many poor Children have their Souls overgrown with <HI>Ignorance, Atheism, Security</HI> and <HI>Prophaness,</HI> and are going to <HI>Destruction</HI> without controll, whilest we are contending and quarreling about these things. <HI>Oh consider</HI> (with bowels of Affe|ction and Compassion) <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> sad the latter end of our shameful neglect of Posterity will be.</HI></P>
<P>Thus (Honoured and Beloved in our Lord) Let us be perswaded in <HI>this our day</HI> to consider <HI>what will be the latter end of our sinful and unsuitable Depor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ments before the Lord:</HI> and be sure to make a right Judgement of it. To that purpose take these Directions.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Consult and credit Scripture-Testimony in this matter.</HI> The good Word of God informs you what <HI>the end</HI> of these and those wayes will be, and is able to make you wise in this respect, if you listen to it. The Scri|pture tells us, that <HI>the end of false Teachers will be according to their Works,</HI> 2 Cor. 11. 15. <HI>And of those that blindly follow them to fall into the Ditch</HI> (or Pit of Destruction) <HI>with them,</HI> Mat. 15. 14. <HI>that the end of Worldly-mindedness will be Destruction,</HI> Phil. 3. 19. <HI>the end of Back sliding and Apo|stacy will be the loss of Gods Favour, and Perdition,</HI> Heb. 10. 38, 39. <HI>The end of unfruitfulness will be to be cut down,</HI> Luk. 13. 7, 9. <HI>and burned,</HI> Heb. 6. 8. <HI>That the latter end, and wages of sin</HI> (one word in the Hebrew sig|nifies both end and wayes) <HI>will be Death,</HI> Rom. 6. 21. <HI>The end</HI> of the wayes of sin depends upon the constitution of God in his Law and Cove|nant, and the sanction thereof: and the Scripture acquaints us faithfully with it. <HI>If you would understand the end of man, you must go into the Sanctuary,</HI> Psal. 73. 17. To hear Gods Counsel and Instruction in the Scri|pture is the way to be wise in and about your <HI>latter and,</HI> Prov. 19. 20. Make Gods Testimonies <HI>the men of your counsel</HI> (as <HI>David</HI> phraseth it, Psal. 119. 24.) <HI>in this matter.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Consult instructing Examples and Experiences in order to a right Un|derstanding of the latter end of your wayes.</HI> The Scripture furnisheth you richly with considerable instances. The way of Sensuality, Security, Neglect of Gods Worship, Degeneracy of the Children of the Church, and corrupting their way ruined the old World. The way of Unclean|ness and of unnatural Lusts ruined <HI>Sodom</HI> and <HI>Gomorr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">h,</HI> the Cities which God overthrew and repented not. The way of Persecution and Oppres|sion of the Church of God ruined <HI>Pharaoh</HI> and his Co-partners and Fol|lowers. The way of Rebellion against Civil and Ecclesiastical Autho|rity ruined <HI>Korah</HI> and his Company: when they were too hard for <HI>Moses</HI>
<PB N="60" REF="000180_0065_0FA315488420E668">
and <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> (being Princes of the Assembly, Men of Renown and Famous in the Congregation) God Himself took them into his own hands, and destroyed them in a stupendous and dreadful manner. Contempt and ill usage of the Lords <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> practices ruined the State of Israel and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Contempt of our Lord Jesus Christ and his Mes|sengers, and putting away the Gospel, brought unparalleld Calamities upon the <HI>lews.</HI> Nay call to mind all your own experiences. Have you not known or heard of these and those Professors abroad, that in the time of their liberty and prosperity were wanton, proud, worldly, despisers of Gods Ministers, con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">io<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s and quarrelsome? And do you not know the end of it? such Examples are instructing, and for our Admo|nition.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Consider wisely the natural Tendency of the wayes themselves,</HI> Some ways of sin do in a way of <HI>physical efficiency,</HI> directly and in their own natural Tendency lead to misery and ruine: as <HI>Intemperance</HI> to the De|struction of Health and Life; <HI>Prodigality</HI> to Poverty and Misery, that it comes on like an Armed man, violently and irresistably; And so <HI>l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">leness</HI> and <HI>Neglect of a mans Calling and Business</HI> naturally works that way, and hath the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> issue. So Divisions among a people lead the way to ruine. It is a proverbial expression of our Saviour, a <HI>Kingdome, divided against itself will not stand.</HI> So any Common wealth, where the Leaders and People are divided, any Church or Churches divided, any Societies divided; they must fall, cannot stand: Not only Because God is angry with them, but also from the nature of the thing it self. Divisions pull down Societies, open a Door and make a Gap for Adver|saries and Oppressors to break in at, that are watching all Advantages. <HI>Enqu&ograve; Discordia Cives Perducit Mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">eros!</HI> The fall of schools and con|tempt of Learning will make way for Rudeness, Ignorance, Want of able Instruments to manage Church and State Affairs, Irreligion and Ruine to this poor Country. This or that miserable Event and End lies in the Womb of these and those wayes. Some wayes of sin naturally breed, are pregnant, and will in time travel with, and bring forth this or that woful issue. Oh <HI>Read your End in your way.</HI> You may do it certainly a some cases. As there are <GAP DESC="foreign"> Heb. 6. 9. things that accompany Salvation, and have a coherence with it. So there are also <GAP DESC="foreign"> Things that have connexion with Destruction, not only in respect of the positive constitution of God, but also in regard of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ature and frame of the things themselves: The due consideration whereof may be of great use in your passing a Judgement upon the end of <HI>year wayes.</HI></P>
