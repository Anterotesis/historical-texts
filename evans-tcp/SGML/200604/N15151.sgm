<SPEAKER>REP. HEROINE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Upon my word, Madam, I was a long while con&s;i|dering whether it was a real or imaginary compliment: I could &s;carcely believe it po&s;&s;ible, that this country, particularly this town, who&s;e name &s;tands foremo&s;t in the annals of America, &s;hould &s;o early plunge into the utmo&s;t exce&s;&s;es of di&s;&s;ipation: How will &s;uch an account read among the friends of America in Europe. I could hardly refrain from tears when I entered the Hall, to &s;ee the re&s;pectable inhabitants of this metropolis, &s;o wantonly introducing a cu&s;tom of publick card playing, even at &s;o early a period after the war. Forgive me, Madam, my expre&s;&s;ing my &s;entiments &s;o freely; but believe me I have hi|therto indulged &s;uch plea&s;ing ideas re&s;pecting this country, from their publick proceedings during the war, that when I find those &s;entiments of their virtue turn out mere chimeras of my own imagina|tion, I cannot but lament my di&s;appointment. The
<PB N="12" REF="019234_0012_0FAA67A2B5308808">
re&s;pect that has been &s;hewn me &s;ince my arrival, I mo&s;t gratefully acknowledge, but often on my re|tiring from the parade of their entertainments. I can|not but pity their delu&s;ion. I did not carry my en|thu&s;ia&s;m &s;o far as to expect to find the rigid Spartan principles practi&s;ed; but I did conceive to be intro|duced into &s;ocieties of frugality and oeconomy: I did expect to find a cultivation of manners &s;ome|what &s;imilar to their publick re&s;olves; but again par|don me, Madam, when I inform you I am greatly di&s;appointed. Briti&s;h gewgaws &mdash;etiquette and pa|rade, are too prevailing to be ea&s;ily eradicated, un|le&s;s &s;ome immediate exertions are made to turn this de&s;tructive current: As a &s;tranger, I cannot with propriety &s;et up to give examples, but on ladies of e&s;tabli&s;hed characters in the country, much ought to be expected from them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. W&mdash;N.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am very unhappy to find your ob&s;ervations are &s;o ju&s;t. I cannot but acknowledge we have too far copied the vices of that nation which we have &s;o late|ly oppo&s;ed: But however, I do not think this late entertaiment will be long continued; there are many re&s;pectable characters among them, who I am per|&s;uaded when they con&s;ider the dangerous tendency of this a&s;&s;embly, will readily di&s;countenance it. We mu&s;t be convinced how dangerous to the morals of youth&mdash;how de&s;tructive to the happine&s;s of families and individuals, an introduction of card parties has ever been; therefore though they have become of the party, which from inattention, rather than from inclination to promote a &s;pirit of di&s;&s;ipation they at

<P>I beg pardon, Madam&mdash;but there is &s;o much laughing, whi&s;pering and talking in the room, that I am quite embarra&s;&s;ed in my play.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Madam IMPORTANCE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I believe, Sir, you have not been u&s;ed to play in a &s;ocial circle&mdash;but rather in places where every idea is ab&s;orb'd in the game.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. BON TON.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why truly, Madam, I have imbibed the manners of Europe &s;o far, that I cannot have ears to attend to conver&s;ation, and eyes to ob&s;erve the variety of objects around me, and at the &s;ame time pay &s;o great attention to the play as to know the di&s;po&s;ition of the cards.</P>

<P>Amu&s;ement, Madam, is not the principle in Eu|rope; po&s;&s;ibly the fir&s;t in&s;titutions of this kind were e&s;tabli&s;hed on the&s;e principles and &s;uppo&s;e the &s;ums to be play'd for, were limited, as among us;&mdash;but the company which now vi&s;it tho&s;e places of publick re&s;ort, do not go for amu&s;ement &s;olely, but to pur|&s;ue a regular branch of bu&s;ine&s;s.&mdash;They have no idea of playing to pa&s;s away a few lei&s;ure hours, but to improve the moments for their profit&mdash;they are their bu&s;y hours&mdash;the time on which depends their future pro&s;pects. Therefore no conver&s;ation while at play is admitted, but what is on the &s;ubject of the game, and a per&s;on would appear equally as ridiculous to be &s;peaking at that time on any other &s;ubject, as to be talking of Hoyle at the tabernacle.</P>
