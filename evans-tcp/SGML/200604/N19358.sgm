<P>IN the publication of <HI>Po&s;thumous Works,</HI> it has been u&s;ual for the Editors or Publi&s;hers to accom|pany them with a Prefatory Addre&s;s,&mdash;generally explaining the particular rea&s;ons for offering them to the world, or relating their peculiar merits, and con&s;equently their claim to the patronage of the lovers of &s;cience. In compliance with this general cu&s;tom we think it nece&s;&s;ary merely to note, that having been frequently &s;olicited to publi&s;h, in a &s;eparate volume, a part of tho&s;e writings of Mrs. BLEECKER which had appeared in the <HI>New-York Magazine,</HI> we conceived a collection of all &s;uch of her poems and e&s;&s;ays as might with propriety come before th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> public, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ould be more likely to meet the approbation bo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> of <HI>her</HI> friends, and of the friends of American l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">te<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ature. Having &s;ug|ge&s;ted this idea to tho&s;e who appeared mo&s;t &s;trenu|ous for the mea&s;ure, we were plea&s;ed to find it met their hearty concurrence; and through the oblig|ing di&s;po&s;ition of her hu&s;band and daughter, we are now happy in being able to pre&s;ent this volume to our fellow citizens.</P>
<P><PB REF="025208_0004_0FCC8E9FE858F6D8">We are indebted to a friend for the idea of adding a number of pro&s;e and poetical e&s;&s;ays, which like|wi&s;e fir&s;t appeared in the <HI>New-York Magazine,</HI> mo&s;t of them under the &s;ignature of ELLA, and which are the production of Mrs. MARGARETTA V. FAU|GERES, the daughter of Mrs. BLEECKER. Our obligations to this lady are much increa&s;ed by the addition of &s;everal Original E&s;&s;ays in ver&s;e, which the reader will find inter&s;per&s;ed in that part of the collection which comprehends her writings.</P>
<P>It is not our intention to recommend this volume by an elaborate di&s;play of its particular merits or peculiar excellencies: the be&s;t recommendation we can give it, is an attentive peru&s;al: and when this is done, that the reader of ta&s;te and elegance will join in a&s;&s;erting, that though it is not faultle&s;s, yet that its merits preponderate, and entitle it to the patronage of every true American, is the candid opinion of</P>

<HEAD>MEMOIRS OF Mrs. ANN ELIZA BLEECKER.</HEAD>
<P>MRS. ANN ELIZA BLEECKER was the younge&s;t child of Mr. BRANDT SCHUYLER, of this city, (the place of her nativity;) &s;he was born in October, anno Domini 1752; and though in her early years &s;he never di&s;played any partiality for &s;chool, yet &s;he was pa&s;&s;ionately fond of books, in&s;omuch that &s;he read with propriety any book that came to hand long before the time that children in common pa&s;s their Spelling-Books. But though her poetical produc|tions (which made their appearance very early) di&s;played a ta&s;te far &s;uperior to her years; yet, &s;o great was her diffidence of
<PB N="ii" REF="025208_0012_0FCCA28E37E26198">
her own abilities, that none but her mo&s;t intimate acquaintance were ever indulged with a view of any of her performances, and <HI>then</HI> they were no &s;ooner peru&s;ed than &s;he de&s;troyed them.</P>
<P>Hence it comes, that none of her com|po&s;itions previous to the year 1769, are extant: in that year &s;he married JOHN J. BLEECKER, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> of <HI>New-Rochelle</HI>; and being willing <HI>now</HI> to cheri&s;h her genius, after a &s;hort re&s;idence in the capital, they retired to <HI>Poughkeep&s;ie,</HI> where they &s;tayed a year or two; and then taking a liking to the northern parts of this &s;tate, they removed to <HI>Tomhanick,</HI> a beautiful &s;olitary little village eighteen miles above <HI>Albany.</HI> Here Mr. BLEECKER built him an hou&s;e on a little eminence, which commanded a plea&s;ing pro&s;pect. On the <HI>ea&s;t</HI> &s;ide of it was an elegantly &s;imple <HI>garden,</HI> where fruits and flowers, exotics as well as natives, flouri&s;hed with beauty; and a little beyond it the roaring river of <HI>Tomhanick</HI> da&s;hed
<PB N="iii" REF="025208_0013_0FCCA290222009C8">
with rapidity its foaming waters among the broken rocks; toward the <HI>we&s;t,</HI> lay wide cultivated fields; in the <HI>rear,</HI> a young or|chard, bounded by a thick fore&s;t; and in <HI>front,</HI> (after cro&s;&s;ing the main road) a mea|dow, through which wandered a dimpling &s;tream, &s;tretched it&s;elf to join a ridge of tall nodding pines, which ro&s;e in awful grandeur on the &s;helving brow of a gra&s;&s;y mountain. Through the openings of this wood you might de&s;cry little cottages &s;cat|tered up and down the country, who&s;e environs the hard hand of Indu&s;try had transformed into rich fields and blooming gardens, and literally cau&s;ed the wilderne&s;s to blo&s;&s;om as the ro&s;e&mdash;It is to this &s;cene &s;he alludes where &s;he &s;o beautifully &s;ays,
<Q><L>Ca&s;t your eyes beyond this meadow,</L>
<L>Painted by a hand Divine,</L>
<L>And ob&s;erve the ample &s;hadow</L>
<L>Of that &s;olemn ridge of pine.</L></Q>
This was &s;uch a retreat as &s;he had always de&s;ired&mdash;the dark fore&s;t, the ru&s;hing river,
<PB N="iv" REF="025208_0014_0FCCA291992A8140">
and the green valley had more charms for her than the gay metropolis &s;he had left, and in which &s;he was &s;o well calculated to &s;hine: and &s;he was &s;o much attached to rural plea&s;ures, that no birds (tho&s;e of prey excepted) were ever &s;uffered to be &s;hot near her habitation if &s;he could pre|vent it&mdash;indeed, they built their ne&s;ts un|mole&s;ted in the very porch of the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>And the cultivation of flowers had like|wi&s;e a large &s;hare of her attention, &s;o much, that where <HI>Flora</HI> had been remi&s;s in deck|ing the &s;od, &s;he took upon her&s;elf that office, by gathering &s;eeds from her own garden and &s;trewing them promi&s;cuou&s;ly in the woods and fields, and along the clo|very borders of her favourite brook.</P>
<P>'Till the memorable 1777, they lived in the mo&s;t perfect tranquillity&mdash;fair pro&s;|pects were opening on every &s;ide&mdash;Her mother, a widow, (an ornament to the &s;ex) lived with her&mdash;her half-&s;i&s;ter, Mi&s;s TEN EYCK <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">er cheerful &s;prightly
<PB N="v" REF="025208_0015_0FCCA2931C8FDFD8">
companion&mdash;and her attentive hu&s;band and prattling children clo&s;ed the circle, and left her &s;carce another wi&s;h on this &s;ide of the grave&mdash;<HI>Then,</HI> indeed, the clamorous thunders of <HI>War</HI> frighted them from their peaceful dwelling, and the bla&s;ting hand of <HI>De&s;olation</HI> di&s;per&s;ed them as a flock in the de&s;ert.</P>
<P>Mr. BLEECKER, hearing of the ap|proaches of the infatuated BURGOYNE, had left Mrs. BLEECKER with the children and &s;ervants, while he went to <HI>Albany</HI> to &s;eek a place for them, (her mother and &s;i&s;ter having ju&s;t quitted her.) But he had &s;carce been gone a day when, as &s;he &s;at at breakfa&s;t, &s;he received intelligence that the enemy were within two miles of the vil|lage, burning and murdering all before them. Terrified beyond de&s;cription &s;he ro&s;e from the table, and taking her ABELLA on her arm, and her other daughter (about four years old) by the hand, &s;he &s;et off on foot, with a young mulatto girl, leav|ing
<PB N="vi" REF="025208_0016_0FCCA294345EB530">
the hou&s;e and furniture to the mercy of the approaching &s;avages. The roads were crouded with carriages loaded with women and children, but none could afford her a&s;&s;i&s;tance&mdash;di&s;tre&s;s was depictured on every countenance, and tears of heartfelt angui&s;h moi&s;tened every cheek. They pa&s;&s;ed on&mdash;no one &s;poke to another&mdash;and no &s;ound but the di&s;mal creaking of bur|dened wheels and the trampling of hor&s;es interrupted the mournful &s;ilence. After <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> tedious walk of four or five miles, &s;he ob|tained a &s;eat for the children upon one of the waggons, and &s;he walked on to <HI>Stony-Arabia,</HI> where &s;he expected to find many friends; but &s;he was deceived&mdash;no door was open to <HI>her,</HI> who&s;e hou&s;e by many of them had been made u&s;e of as a home&mdash; &s;he wandered from hou&s;e to hou&s;e, and at length obtained a place in the garret of a rich old acquaintance, where a couple of blankets, &s;tretched upon &s;ome boards, were offered her as a bed; &s;he, however, &s;at up
<PB N="vii" REF="025208_0017_0FCCA295AEBC5718">
all night and wept, and the next morning Mr. BLEECKER coming from <HI>Albany,</HI> met with them and returned to that city, from whence they &s;et off with &s;everal other fa|milies by water. At twelve miles below <HI>Albany</HI> little ABELLA was taken &s;o ill that they were obliged to go on &s;hore, where &s;he died. The <HI>impre&s;&s;ions</HI> this event made on Mrs. BLEECKER's mind were never effaced.

<P>From this period till the year 1781, they lived in tolerable tranquillity, when, in the beginning of Augu&s;t, as Mr. BLEECKER was a&s;&s;i&s;ting in the harve&s;t, he, with two of his men, were made pri&s;oners by a party
<PB N="xi" REF="025208_0021_0FCCA29DD6DF9740">
from <HI>Canada,</HI> and taken off immediately. As it was late in the afternoon, Mrs. BLEECKER expected him with a degree of impatience, and began to be apprehen&s;ive that &s;omething uncommon had occurred: a &s;ervant was therefore di&s;patched, who &s;oon returned with the &s;orrowful account, that he could not &s;ee any of them, and that the waggon and hor&s;es were in the road tied to a tree.</P>
<P>She was at no lo&s;s to conjecture what was become of him, for a number of &s;mall parties from <HI>Canada</HI> were known to be &s;culking in the woods, for the &s;ole pur|po&s;e of carrying off the mo&s;t active citi|zens. The neighbours therefore were im|mediately alarmed, and the woods, as far as was practicable, were &s;earched; but they could not di&s;cover a &s;ingle trace of the party. Mrs. BLEECKER, giving him up for lo&s;t, &s;et off for <HI>Albany</HI> directly, though it was then near night, and abandoned her|&s;elf to the mo&s;t hopele&s;s grief; but, by a
<PB N="xii" REF="025208_0022_0FCCA29EC7BD4ED8">
wonderful train of events, Mr. BLEECKER was re-taken by a party from <HI>Bennington,</HI> after having pa&s;&s;ed the la&s;t habitation on this &s;ide of the <HI>Green-Mountains,</HI> and when his conductors for the <HI>fir&s;t time</HI> had con&s;i|dered them&s;elves as perfectly &s;ecure. He returned to her in &s;ix days, and the joy &s;he felt at finding him operating more power|fully than the grief &s;he experienced at his lo&s;s, a fit of &s;ickne&s;s en&s;ued, which nearly proved fatal. They again returned to <HI>Tomhanick.</HI></P>
<P>Though Mrs. BLEECKER was witne&s;s to many &s;cenes of di&s;tre&s;s during the late war, in many of which &s;he was the principal &s;ufferer; yet, the idea of a <HI>far di&s;tant</HI> peace, which &s;hould again re&s;tore her to her friends, gilt the &s;olitary &s;hades which encompa&s;&s;ed her, and bore her up under frequent and poignant griefs.</P>
<P>In the year 1783, (the &s;pring after the peace,) &s;he re-vi&s;ited <HI>New-York,</HI> in hopes of &s;eeing her old acquaintance and friends;
<PB N="xiii" REF="025208_0023_0FCCA2A02C893AD8">
but her hopes were far from being realiz|ed&mdash;&s;ome were dead; others had left the continent; and the few who remained were in different &s;tates: She &s;aw her half-&s;i&s;ter, Mi&s;s TEN EYCK, but once, and then but for a few minutes, as one party was em|barking for <HI>New-York</HI> ju&s;t as the other ar|rived at <HI>Albany.</HI> Her principal corre&s;pon|dents and much-loved relatives, the Mi&s;s V** W***'s, were in <HI>Jer&s;ey</HI>; and as the Briti&s;h were &s;till here, &s;he could not (with|out the greate&s;t difficulty) vi&s;it them. But the ruinous condition of her native city gave &s;uch a &s;hock to her &s;pirits as the unit|ed efforts of her rea&s;on and fortitude were not able to ward off. The places which &s;he once knew as the &s;cenes of fe&s;tivity, were now &s;unk into du&s;t&mdash;the place that once knew them knowing them no more; or if by hard &s;earching &s;he at la&s;t de&s;cried them, they only met her eye as monuments of her pa&s;t plea&s;ures&mdash;dreary piles, mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l|dering fa&s;t beneath the relentle&s;s hand of

<HI>Time</HI> and <HI>War.</HI> Her &s;en&s;ibility was too keen for her peace&mdash;She had &s;truggled on through the war, and had &s;uffered <HI>Hope</HI> to beguile the hours devoted to di&s;tre&s;s: but <HI>now</HI> the &s;cene was changed&mdash;the illu&s;ion vani&s;hed, and &s;he concluded <HI>now</HI> &s;he &s;hould &s;ee no more good upon earth. She return|ed again to her cottage, where &s;he found her health very rapidly decline; and on the 23d of the following November, about noon-day, (after two days confinement to her bed) her calm &s;pirit took its flight from its &s;hattered habitation, without a &s;truggle or a groan. She retained her &s;en|&s;es till within a few minutes of her death; and the la&s;t words &s;he uttered to her weep|ing hu&s;band and family, were a&s;&s;urances of the plea&s;ing pro&s;pect <HI>Immortality</HI> offered her.</P>
<P>It is needle&s;s to &s;ay her lo&s;s was &s;everely felt&mdash;it may be naturally &s;uppo&s;ed. The benevolence of her di&s;po&s;ition had extend|ed it&s;elf to all cla&s;&s;es of people; and in
<PB N="xv" REF="025208_0025_0FCCA2A3EDD886C8">
the village where &s;he dwelt, there were &s;everal families who might be called her dependants. To the aged and infirm &s;he was a phy&s;ician and a friend&mdash;to the or|phan &s;he was a mother&mdash;and a &s;oother of the widow's woes; all loved&mdash;all honour|ed her: and when they followed her to the grave, they weeping &s;aid, (though differ|ently expre&s;&s;ed, &s;till meaning the &s;ame,) "<HI>We have lo&s;t</HI> HER <HI>who&s;e equal we &s;hall never &s;ee again!</HI>"</P>
<P>It is to be regretted that the writings which we now have are but a &s;mall part of what &s;he compo&s;ed: &s;he was frequently very lively, and would then give way to the flights of her fertile fancy, and write &s;ongs, &s;atires, and burle&s;que: but, as draw|ing a cord too tight will make it break, thus &s;he would no &s;ooner cea&s;e to be <HI>merry,</HI> than the heavie&s;t <HI>dejection</HI> would &s;ucceed, and then all the pieces which were not as melancholy as her&s;elf, &s;he de&s;troyed. As &s;he &s;eldom kept copies of her poetical epi&s;|tles,
<PB N="xvi" REF="025208_0026_0FCCA2A5ED56F2E8">
the mo&s;t of <HI>them</HI> are lo&s;t; one in par|ticular, written &s;ome little time before &s;he fled from <HI>Tomhanick,</HI> in 1777, and directed to General BURGOYNE, was left in her bu|reau; the bureau was broken open and its contents plundered by his men; but whe|ther the letter ever reached him or not, is unknown. In the winters of 1779 and 1780, &s;he amu&s;ed her&s;elf and friends by writing what &s;he called the <HI>Albany Gazette,</HI> which was &s;ent by every opportunity to <HI>Fi&s;hkill,</HI> where &s;everal of her relations lived. This lively and ingenious performance was much admired, and being handed about from one company to another, is entirely lo&s;t. Several political and &s;atirical pieces &s;hared a &s;imilar fate.</P>
<P>Some of tho&s;e, however, which are left, are here pre&s;ented to the public. The poli|tical &s;entiments di&s;played in &s;everal of them will, it is probable, recommend them to the notice and favour of the Patriot, and the re&s;t may plea&s;e the lovers of artle&s;s &s;tyle.
<PB N="xvii" REF="025208_0027_0FCCA2A75BB260B8">
Many of them are faulty, but their merits are more numerous than their <HI>defects,</HI> and <HI>the&s;e</HI> will be ea&s;ily pardoned and forgotten by all who knew her; for <HI>Detraction</HI> will not ri&s;e up again&s;t <HI>her,</HI> after death, who&s;e virtues, when alive, endeared her to &s;o many admiring <HI>friends,</HI> and who&s;e <HI>enemies</HI> (and <HI>Envy</HI> created her &s;ome) could not &s;peak evil of her.</P>
<P>As mo&s;t of the&s;e pieces were intended for the amu&s;ement of her&s;elf and particular friends, and not for the public eye, they appear as they flowed extempore from her pen.

<SALUTE>DEAR SUSAN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HOWEVER fond of novels and romances you may be, the unfortunate adventures of one of my neighbours, who died ye&s;terday, will make you de&s;pi&s;e that fiction, in which, know|ing the &s;ubject to be fabulous, we can never be &s;o truly intere&s;ted. While this lady was ex|piring, Mrs. C&mdash; V&mdash;, her near kin&s;|woman, related to me her unhappy hi&s;tory, in which I &s;hall now take the liberty of intere&s;t|ing you benevolent and feeling heart.</P>
<P>MARIA KITTLE was the only i&s;&s;ue of her parents, who cultivated a large farm on the
<PB N="20" REF="025208_0031_0FCCA2AB69C874F8">
banks of the <HI>Hud&s;on,</HI> eighteen miles above <HI>Al|bany.</HI> They were per&s;ons of good natural abi|lities, improved by &s;ome learning; yet, con|&s;cious of a deficiency in their education, they &s;tudied nothing &s;o much as to render their little daughter truly accompli&s;hed.</P>
<P>MARIA was born in the year 1721. Her promi&s;ing infancy pre&s;aged a maturity of excel|lencies; every amiable quality dawned through her li&s;ping prattle; every per&s;onal grace at|tended her attitudes and played over her fea|tures. As &s;he advanced through the playful &s;tage of childhood, &s;he became more eminent than a Penelope for her indu&s;try&punc; yet, &s;oon as the &s;un declined, &s;he always retired with her books until the time of repo&s;e, by which means &s;he &s;oon informed her opening mind with the principles of every u&s;eful &s;cience. She was beloved by all her female companions, who, though they ea&s;ily di&s;covered her &s;uperior ele|gance of manners, in&s;tead of envying, were excited to imitate her. As &s;he always made one in their little parties of plea&s;ure on fe&s;tival days, it is no wonder that &s;he &s;oon became the reigning godde&s;s among the &s;wains. She was importuned to admit the addre&s;&s;es of numbers,
<PB N="21" REF="025208_0032_0FCCA2ACE8D71BD0">
whom &s;he politely di&s;carded, and withdrew her&s;elf awhile from public ob&s;ervation. How|ever, the fame of her charms attracted &s;everal gentlemen of family from <HI>Albany,</HI> who intruded on her retirement, &s;oliciting her hand. But this happine&s;s was re&s;erved for a near relation of her's, one Mr. KITTLE, who&s;e merits had made an impre&s;&s;ion on her heart. He, although not hand&s;ome, was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a mo&s;t engaging addre&s;s; while his learning and moral virtues more particularly recommended him to her e&s;teem. Their parents &s;oon di&s;covered their reciprocal pa&s;&s;ion, and highly approving of it, ha&s;tened their marriage, which was celebrated under the mo&s;t happy au&s;pices.</P>
<P>MARIA was fifteen when married. They removed to his farm, on which he had built a &s;mall neat hou&s;e, &s;urrounded by tall cedars, which gave it a contemplative air. It was &s;i|tuated on an eminence, with a green inclo&s;ure in the front, graced by a well cultivated gar|den on one &s;ide, and on the other by a clear &s;tream, which, ru&s;hing over a bed of white pebble, gave them a high poli&s;h, that ca&s;t a &s;oft gleam through the water.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="025208_0033_0FCCA2AF30C37988">Here they re&s;ided in the tranquil enjoyment of that happine&s;s which &s;o much merit and in|nocence deferred: the indigent, the &s;orrowful, the unfortunate were always &s;ure of con&s;ola|tion when they entered tho&s;e peaceful doors. They were almo&s;t adored by their neighbours, and even the wild &s;avages them&s;elves, who often re&s;orted thither for refre&s;hments when hunting, expre&s;&s;ed the greate&s;t regard for them, and admiration of their virtues.</P>
<P>In little more than a year they were ble&s;&s;ed with a daughter, the lovelier re&s;emblance of her lovely mother: as &s;he grew up, her graces increa&s;ing, promi&s;ed a bloom and under&s;tand|ing equal to her's; the Indians, in particular, were extremely fond of the &s;miling ANNA; whenever they found a young fawn, or caught a brood of wood-ducks, or &s;urpri&s;ed the young beaver in their daily excur&s;ions through the fore&s;ts, they pre&s;ented them with plea&s;ure to her; they brought her the earlie&s;t &s;trawberries, the &s;carlet plumb, and other delicate wild fruits in painted ba&s;kets.</P>
<P>How did the fond parents hearts delight to &s;ee their beloved one &s;o univer&s;ally care&s;&s;ed! When they &s;auntered over the vernal fields
<PB N="23" REF="025208_0034_0FCCA2B0AAA8A780">
with the little prattler wantoning before them collecting flowers and pur&s;uing the velvet elu|&s;ive butterfly, MARIA's cheek &s;uffu&s;ing with rapture, "Oh my dear," &s;he would &s;ay,
<Q>we are happier than human beings can expect to be; how trivial are the evils annexed to our &s;ituation! may God avert that our hea|ven be limited to this life!</Q></P>
<P>Eleven years now elap&s;ed before Mrs. KIT|TLE di&s;covered any &s;igns of pregnancy: her &s;pou&s;e &s;ilently wi&s;hed for a &s;on, and his de&s;ires were at length gratified; &s;he was delivered of a charming boy, who was named, after him, WILLIAM.</P>
<P>A French and Indian war had commenced &s;ometime before; but about eight months after her delivery, the &s;avages began to commit the mo&s;t horrid depredations on the Engli&s;h frontiers. Mr. KITTLE, alarmed at the danger of his brothers, who dwelt near <HI>Fort-Edward,</HI> (the elde&s;t being ju&s;t married to a very agree|able young woman) invited them to re&s;ide with him during the war.</P>
<P>They were &s;carce arrived when the enemy made further incur&s;ions in the country, burn|ing the villages and &s;calping the inhabitants,
<PB N="24" REF="025208_0035_0FCCA2B25623BD68">
neither re&s;pecting age or &s;ex. This terribly alarmed Mrs. KITTLE; &s;he began to prepare for flight, and the next evening after receiving this intelligence, as &s;he and Mr. KITTLE were bu&s;ily employed in packing up china and other things, they were acco&s;ted by &s;everal Indians, who&s;e wigwams were contiguous to the village of <HI>Schochticook,</HI> and who always &s;eemed well affected to the Engli&s;h. An elderly &s;avage undertook to be prolocutor, and de&s;ired the family to compo&s;e them&s;elves, a&s;&s;uring them they &s;hould be cautioned again&s;t any approach|ing danger. To inforce his argument, he pre|&s;ented MARIA with a belt interwoven with &s;ilk and beads, &s;aying,
<Q>There, receive my token of friend&s;hip: we go to dig up the hatchet, to &s;ink it in the heads of your ene|mies; we &s;hall guard this wood with a wall of fire&mdash;you &s;hall be &s;afe.</Q>
A warm plow of hope deepened in MARIA's cheek at this&mdash; Then ordering wine to be brought to the friendly &s;avages, with a &s;mile of diffidence, "I am afraid," &s;aid &s;he,
<Q>nece&s;&s;ity may oblige you to abandon us, or neglect of your pro|mi&s;e may deprive us of your protection.</Q>&mdash; "Neglect of my promi&s;e!" retorted he with
<PB N="25" REF="025208_0036_0FCCA2B3AC9AF9D0">
&s;ome acrimony:
<Q>No, MARIA, I am a true man; I &s;hoot the arrow up to the Great Captain every new moon: depend upon it, I will trample down the briars round your dwelling, that you do not hurt your feet.</Q>
MARIA now retired, bowing a grateful ac|knowledgment, and leaving the &s;avages to in|dulge their fe&s;tivity, who pa&s;&s;ed the night in the mo&s;t vociferous mirth.</P>
<P>Mrs. KITTLE, with a &s;ort of exultation, re|lated the &s;ubject of their conference to her hu&s;|band, who had ab&s;ented him&s;elf on their fir&s;t appearance, having formed &s;ome &s;u&s;picion of the &s;incerity of their friend&s;hip, and not being willing to be duped by their di&s;&s;imulation. "And now," added MARIA &s;miling,
<Q>our fears may again &s;ub&s;ide: Oh my dear! my happine&s;s is trebled into rapture, by &s;eeing you and my &s;weet babes out of danger.</Q>
He only &s;ighed, and reaching his arm round her poli&s;hed neck, pre&s;&s;ed her to his bo&s;om. After a &s;hort pau&s;e, "My love," &s;aid he,
<Q>be not too confident of their fidelity; you &s;urely know what a &s;mall dependence is to be placed on their promi&s;es: however, to appear &s;u&s;|picious might be &s;uddenly fatal to us; we
<PB N="26" REF="025208_0037_0FCCA2B592BC3808">
will therefore &s;u&s;pend our journey to <HI>Albany</HI> for a few days.</Q>
Though MARIA's &s;oul &s;addened at the conviction of this truth; though her fears again urged her to propo&s;e immediate flight, yet &s;he acquie&s;ced; and having &s;upped with the family, this tender pair &s;unk a&s;leep on the bo&s;om of re&s;t.</P>
<P>Early the next morning Mr. KITTLE aro&s;e, fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ing a ki&s;s on MARIA's &s;oft cheek, as &s;he &s;lumbered with her infant in her arms. He then awaked his brother, reminding him that he had propo&s;ed a hunting match the pre|ceding evening. "It is true," replied PETER,
<Q>but &s;ince ho&s;tilities have commenced &s;o near us as the Indians inform, I think it rather imprudent to quit the family.</Q>&mdash;<Q>Come, come,</Q>
replied the other,
<Q>do not let us intimidate the neighbours by cloi&s;tering our|&s;elves up with women and children.</Q>&mdash;<Q>I reject the thought,</Q>
rejoined PETER,
<Q>of being afraid.</Q>
Then having dre&s;&s;ed him|&s;elf, while his brother charged their pieces, they left the hou&s;e, and traver&s;ed the pathle&s;s gra&s;s for many hours without perceiving any thing but &s;mall birds, who filled the fragrant air with melody, "PETER," &s;aid Mr. KIT|TLE,
<PB N="27" REF="025208_0038_0FCC8E99E5CBEB28">
ca&s;ting his eyes around the lovely land|&s;cape,
<Q>what a profu&s;ion of &s;weets does Na|ture exhale to plea&s;e her intelligent crea|tures! I feel my heart expand with love and gratitude to heaven every moment, nor can I ever be grateful enough. I have health and competence, a lovely fond wife who&s;e &s;mile would calm the rude&s;t &s;torm of pa&s;&s;ion, and two infants blo&s;&s;oming into perfection; all my &s;ocial ties are yet unbroken&mdash;PETER, I anticipate my heaven&mdash;But why, my bro|ther, do you turn pale? what dreadful idea &s;tiffens your features with amazement? what in God's name ails you, PETER? are you unwell? &s;it down under this tree awhile.</Q>
&mdash;To the&s;e interrogatories PETER replied,
<Q>Excu&s;e my weakne&s;s, I am not unwell, but an unu&s;ual horror chilled my blood; I felt as if the damps of death pre&s;t already round my &s;oul; but the vapour is gone off again, I feel quite better.</Q>
Mr. KITTLE cheered his brother, attributing his emotion to fear; who, by this time, having re-a&s;&s;umed his com|po&s;ure, entered into di&s;cour&s;e with cheerful|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;s, refu&s;ing to return home without having killed any thing.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="025208_0039_0FCC8E9B62BED620">Then ri&s;ing, they proceeded through lofty groves of pine, and open fields that &s;eemed to bend under the heavy hand of Ceres. At la&s;t, di&s;appointment and fatigue prevailed on them to return home&punc; they had gone farther than they apprehended; but pa&s;&s;ing along the bank of the river within a few miles of Mr. KIT|TLE's, they e&s;pied a fat doe walking &s;ecurely on the beach, which PETER &s;oftly approach|ing, levelled his piece with &s;o good an aim that the animal dropped in&s;tantly at the explo&s;ion. This &s;eeming &s;ucce&s;s was, however, the origin of their calamities; for immediately after, two &s;avages appeared, directed in their cour&s;e by the firing. Setting up a loud yell, they ran up to the brothers and di&s;charged their fire-arms. Mr. KITTLE &s;tarted back, but PETER receiv|ed a brace of balls in his bo&s;om.

with the other, who was loading again, he wre&s;ted his firelock from him, and felled him to the ground with the but-end of it. This was no time for reflection or unavailing laments; the danger was eminent: &s;o leaving the &s;avages for dead, with a mournful &s;ilence Mr. KITTLE ha&s;tened to throw the deer from off his hor&s;e, and laid his bleeding brother acro&s;s him.</P>
<P>When our &s;ouls are gloomy, they &s;eem to ca&s;t a &s;hade over the objects that &s;urround us, and make nature corre&s;pondent to our feelings: &s;o Mr. KITTLE thought the night fell with a deeper gloom than u&s;ual. The &s;oft notes of evening birds &s;eemed to be the re&s;pon&s;es of &s;a|vage yells. The echo of his tread, which he never before regarded, now rung di&s;mally hol|low in his ears. Even the ru&s;tling of the winds through the leaves &s;eemed attended with a &s;o|lemnity that chilled him with cold tremors. As he proceeded with his mournful charge, his feelings were alarmed for his dear MARIA; he dreaded the agitation and di&s;tre&s;s this ad|venture would throw her in: but it was un|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">oidable!</P>

<Q>it is all over&mdash;we are betrayed&mdash;your brother is killed!</Q>
&mdash;"Too true, oh, too fatally true!" replied he, falling on his knees be&s;ide her as &s;he &s;unk down,

MARIA was &s;ilent; at length &s;he bur&s;t into a flood of tears, which his endearments only augmented. Then expo&s;tulating with him,
<Q>Is it not enough,</Q>
cried &s;he,

<Q>how can I dare to propo&s;e a danger to them from which I would &s;hrink my&s;elf? their lives are equally precious with mine: but God may di&s;appoint our fears, my love!</Q>
He would have continued, but his &s;pou&s;e, ri&s;ing from her &s;eat, interrupted him&mdash;

Meanwhile, as &s;he &s;tept to the cra|dle for her &s;uckling, the fair ANNA, who was li&s;tening at the door anxious to hear her parents &s;entiments on this occa&s;ion, quitted her &s;tation and flew to them &s;wift as light; dropping on her knees before her father, and looked up in his face with the mo&s;t attractive graces and the per&s;ua&s;ive eloquence of &s;implicity. Her neck and features were elegantly turned, her com|plexion fairer than the tubero&s;e, and contra&s;ted by the mo&s;t &s;hining ringlets of dark hair. Her eyes, who&s;e brilliancy was &s;oftened through the medium of tears, for a while dwelt tenderly on his countenance.

<P>Mrs. KITTLE now approached with her playful infant in her arms; but its winning ac|tions extorted nothing but groans from her pain|ed bo&s;om, which was more &s;tormy than On|tario-Lake, when agitated by fierce winds.

<Q>O God! what are your doing, my ra&s;h, ra&s;h, unfortunate hu&s;band! you will be &s;acrificed!</Q>
Then falling on her knees, &s;he caught hold of his hand and &s;obbed out,
<Q>O pity me! have mercy on your&s;elf, on me, on my child!</Q>&mdash;"Alas! my love," &s;aid he, half turning with a look of di&s;traction,
<Q>what can we do? let us be re&s;igned to the will of God.</Q>
So &s;aying he unbarred the door, and that in&s;tant received a fatal bullet in his bo&s;om, and fell backward writhing in agonies of death; the re&s;t recoiled at this horrible &s;pectacle, and huddled in a corner, &s;ending forth the mo&s;t piercing cries: in the interim the &s;avages ru&s;h|ing in with great &s;houts, proceeded to mangle the corp&s;e, and having made an inci&s;ion round his head with a crooked knife, they tugged off his bloody &s;calp with barbarous triumph. While this was perpetrating, an Indian, hi|deou&s;ly painted, &s;trode &s;erociou&s;ly up to COME|LIA, (who &s;unk away at the &s;ight, and fainted o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> a chair) and cleft her white forehead deep|ly with his tomahack.

<P>During this horrid carnage, the dead were &s;tripped, and dragged from the hou&s;e, when one of the helli&s;h band advanced to MARIA, who circling her babes with her white arms, was &s;ending hopele&s;s petitions to heaven, and bemoaning their cruelly lo&s;t &s;ituation: as he approached, expecting the fatal &s;troke, &s;he en|deavoured to guard her children, and with &s;up|plicating looks, implored for mercy.

This was no time, however, to irritate him, by reminding him of his pro|mi&s;e; yet, gue&s;&s;ing her thoughts, he antici|pated her remon&s;trance. "MARIA," &s;aid he,

So &s;aying he &s;eized her laughing babe by the wri&s;ts, and forcibly endeavoured to draw him from her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">s. At this, terrified beyond conception, &s;he exclaimed,
<Q>O God! leave me, leave me my child! he &s;hall not go, though a legion of de|vils &s;hould try to &s;eparate us!</Q>
Holding him &s;till fa&s;t, while the Indian applied his &s;trength to tear him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, gna&s;hing his teeth at her op|po&s;ition; "Help! God of heaven!" &s;creamed &s;he,

By this time the breathle&s;s babe dropt its head on its bo&s;om; the writs were nigh pinched off, and &s;eeing him ju&s;t expiring, with a dreadful &s;hriek &s;he re&s;igned him to the mercile&s;s hands of the &s;avage, who in&s;tantly da&s;hed his little forehead again&s;t the &s;tones, and ca&s;ting his bleeding body at &s;ome di&s;tance from the hou&s;e, left him to make his exit in feeble and unheard groans.&mdash;Then in|deed,

Then ru&s;hing to her dead infant with redoubled cries, and clapping her hands, &s;he laid her&s;elf over his mangled body; again &s;oftened in tears and moans, &s;he wiped the blood from his gha&s;tly countenance, and pre&s;t him to her heaving bo&s;om, alternately care&s;&s;ing him and her trembling ANNA, who, clinging to her with bitter wailings, and ki&s;&s;ing her hands and face; entreated her to implore the &s;a|vages for mercy.

played round his &s;oul, he lifted up his eyes, and through an opening in the woods beheld his farm: but what language can expre&s;s his &s;urpri&s;e and con&s;ternation at &s;eeing his habita|tion &s;o &s;uddenly de&s;olated! a loud exclamation of amaze bur&s;t from the whole company at &s;o unexpected a view&mdash;the blood revolted from Mr. KITTLE's cheek&mdash;his heart throbbed un|der the big emotion, and all agha&s;t, &s;purring on his hor&s;e, he entered the inclo&s;ure with full &s;peed.&mdash;Stop here unhappy man! here let the fibres of thy heart crack with excruciat|ing mi&s;ery&mdash;let the cruel view of mangled wretches, &s;o nearly allied to thee, extort drops of blood from thy cleaving bo&s;om!&mdash;It did&mdash; it did. Uttering a deep groan he fell in&s;en&s;ible from his hor&s;e, while his attendants, ha&s;tening towards him, were &s;hocked beyond concep|tion at the di&s;mal &s;pectacle; and, &s;tarting back with averted eyes from the dead, were thun|der &s;truck, not having power to move or &s;peak. After awhile two Indians (who being u&s;ed to &s;anguinary &s;cenes, recovered them|&s;elves fir&s;t) took a blanket, and walking back|ward to the mangled COMELIA, threw it over her naked body; the others then timidly

advanced, and Mr. KITTLE opening his eyes, groaned again bitterly; then rai&s;ing him&s;elf on his knees, with a look of unutterable an|gui&s;h, he called upon his dear MARIA. Alas! no voice but the &s;olemn repetition of his own cries was articulated to him: then ri&s;ing with an air of di&s;traction, he &s;talked round the bloody &s;cene, and examined the dead bodies; fir&s;t uncovering the pale vi&s;age of COMELIA, he &s;urveyed in &s;ilence her di&s;torted features; but perceiving it was not MARIA, he gently laid the cloth over again, and turning furi|ou&s;ly, caught up his gha&s;tly infant, who&s;e little body was black with contu&s;ions, and his &s;kull horribly fractured. Almo&s;t fainting un|der his mournful load, and &s;taggering at the dreadful di&s;covery, he depo&s;ited it again on the bloody earth, and clapping his hands to|gether repeatedly with violence,
<Q>O hell! hell!</Q>
he cried,
<Q>you cannot inflict tor|ments &s;o exqui&s;ite as tho&s;e I now &s;uffer! how am I cru&s;hed to the center! how deeply am I degraded below the worms of the &s;od! O my children! my children! where are you now? O my wife! my MARIA! the beloved of my bo&s;om, are you

Oh! why was I ab&s;ent in this fatal hour? why did not their groans vibrate on my &s;oul that I might have flown to their aid?</Q>
Thus wildly lamenting and wandering among the &s;moaking ruins, he picked up &s;ome of the calcined bo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> of his once beautiful ANNA. At this &s;ight de&s;pair &s;hook his &s;oul afre&s;h, new agonies convul&s;ed his features, and dropping the &s;ad evidence of his mi&s;eries, he extended his arms to Heaven, and roared out,
<Q>Revenge! great God! re|venge if thou art ju&s;t and kind as repre&s;ent|ed! Oh! that I had the power of an arch|angel to thunder eternal horrors on the guilty wretches who have bla&s;ted the bud of my happine&s;s, who have darkened the brighte&s;t eyes that ever opened on the light!</Q></P>
<P>The men here interfering, to con&s;ole him ob&s;erved, the bones were probably tho&s;e of his brother PETER; but on finding his &s;keleton entire, Mr. KITTLE in&s;i&s;ted that it mu&s;t have

<P>You may judge, my dear, what a panic the appearance of this mournful cavalcade &s;truck over the inhabitants of this defencele&s;s village. Mr. KITTLE was gently laid on a bed, and being let blood, his re&s;piration became le&s;s ob&s;tructed, though he continued &s;en&s;ele&s;s till his unfortunate family were interred.

<P>But doubtle&s;s, my dear, your generous &s;en|&s;ibility is alarmed at my &s;ilence about Mrs. KITTLE; I think we left her repo&s;ing under a tree: &s;he was the fir&s;t that awaked as the &s;un began to exhale the cry&s;tal globules of morning, when half ri&s;ing, and reclining on her elbow, &s;he &s;urveyed the lovely land&s;cape

This &s;he de|clined with vi&s;ible dete&s;tation; and turning to her brother, with the dignity of con&s;cious merit in di&s;tre&s;s, "No," &s;aid &s;he,

This they readily granted, and farther to ingratiate them&s;elves in the pri&s;oners' fa|vour, they di&s;patched a young Indian to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">at for partridges or quails in the groves ad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ng them: He in&s;tantly returned with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> wood-pigeons, &s;carcely fledged, which he p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e|&s;ented to HENRY, who cleaned and broiled them on &s;ticks, with an officious &s;olicitude to plea&s;e his &s;i&s;ter, which &s;he ob&s;erved with a look of gratitude, and taking a pigeon from the &s;tick, began to eat more from complai&s;ance than inclination.

the dry fields of grain, would &s;corch off hundreds of acres in a few moments, and form a burning path for their de&s;troyers. As the &s;un advanced to his zenith, its rays beat fierce|ly on our travellers, augmented by the crack|ling flames around them; when meeting with a cool &s;tream of water, MARIA was com|manded to &s;it down (being over-heated) while the re&s;t approached the rivulet: the Indian that guarded MARIA was &s;tooping down to drink, when a loud ru&s;tling among the leaves and trampling of bu&s;hes attracted his attention; he li&s;tened awhile &s;eemingly much alarmed, then &s;tarting up &s;uddenly, he flew to MARIA, and caught hold of her hair, aiming his hatchet at her head: the con&s;equence was obvious, and her fate &s;eemed inevitable; yet, with a &s;toical compo&s;ure, &s;he folded her arms acro&s;s, and waited the fatal &s;troke with perfect re&s;igna|tion; but while the weapon was yet &s;u&s;pended over her, chancing to look around, he perceived the noi&s;e to proceed from a large deer, who&s;e antlers were entangled in the branches of a thicket.

then de&s;iring her to ri&s;e and drink, he quickly &s;hot the deer, his a&s;&s;oci|ates helping him to &s;kin it. In&s;tead of quench|ing her thir&s;t &s;he &s;at down pen&s;ive on the flow|ery margin, ca&s;ting he eyes carele&s;sly on the &s;tream: &s;he knew not whether to e&s;teem her late deliverance from death a happy provi|dence or protraction of mi&s;ery.

A gu&s;h of tears concluded her &s;oliloquy; and being called to attend the company, &s;he aro&s;e, and they began

their journey for the afternoon. HENRY de|&s;iring to have a piece of veni&s;on (having left it behind, &s;eldom incommoding them&s;elves with more than the hide and tallow) they re|turned and obliged him with a haunch, which was very fat: at the next interval of travel he dre&s;&s;ed it for him&s;elf and MARIA. In the evening they cro&s;&s;ed the river &s;omewhat be|low <HI>Fort-Edward,</HI> in a canoe left hid under &s;ome bu&s;hes for that purpo&s;e. They ob&s;erved the mo&s;t profound &s;ilence until they entered the woods again; but it was very late before they halted, which they did in a deep hollow, &s;urrounded by pines who&s;e tops &s;eemed to be lo&s;t in the clouds. It was nece&s;&s;ary here to light a fire, for the wolves howled mo&s;t dread|fully, and the whole fore&s;t rung with the cries of wild bea&s;ts of various &s;orts. The confines of hell could not have given MARIA more di&s;mal ideas than her pre&s;ent &s;ituation: the horrid gloom of the place, the &s;cowling looks of her murderous companions, the &s;hrill &s;hrieks of owls, the loud cries of the wolf, and mournful &s;creams of panthers, which were redoubled by di&s;tant echoes as the terrible &s;ounds &s;eemed dying away, &s;hook her frame

with cold tremors&mdash;&s;he &s;unk under the op|pre&s;&s;ion of terror, and almo&s;t fainted in HENRY's arms; however, on perceiving the bea&s;ts dur&s;t not approach the light, but began to retire, &s;he became a little more a&s;&s;ured, and helped HENRY to erect a booth of pine branches, making a bed of the &s;ame materials in it while he prepared their &s;upper: having eaten, and kindled a large fire in the front of her arbour, &s;he laid down and &s;oon fell in a deep &s;leep. She felt her&s;elf refre&s;hed by this unexpected repo&s;e, and the next morning, with &s;ome alacrity, continued her journey, hoping at la&s;t to arrive at &s;ome Chri&s;tian &s;et|tlement. Arriving at <HI>Lake-Champlain,</HI> they rai&s;ed a wigwam on the bank, expecting the coming of Indians from the oppo&s;ite &s;hore to carry them over.</P>
<P>Here our unfortunate captives were &s;tript of their habits, already rent to pieces by briers, and attired each with remnants of old blankets. In this new dre&s;s Mrs. KITTLE ventured to expo&s;tulate with the &s;avages, but it was talk|ing to the &s;tormy ocean; her complaints &s;erv|ed only to divert them; &s;o retiring among the bu&s;hes, &s;he adju&s;ted her coar&s;e dre&s;s &s;omewhat

decently, and then <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">ing her&s;elf &s;ilently un|der a &s;preading tree, indulged her&s;elf in the luxury of &s;orrow. HENRY, &s;en&s;ible that they expected more fortitude from him, and that if he &s;unk under his adver&s;e fortune he &s;hould be wor&s;e treated, affected to be cheerful; he a&s;&s;i&s;ted them in catching &s;almon, with which the lake abounds; an incredible quantity of wild fowl frequenting the lake al&s;o, he laid &s;nares for tho&s;e of the le&s;&s;er &s;ort, (not being allowed fire-arms) and &s;ucceeded &s;o well, that his dexterity was highly commended, and night coming on, they regaled them&s;elves on the fruits of their indu&s;try. The night was exceedingly dark, but calm; a thick mi&s;t ho|vered over the woods, and the &s;mall ridgy waves &s;oftly rolled to the &s;hore, when &s;udden|ly a large meteor, or fiery exhalation, pa&s;&s;ed by them with &s;urpri&s;ing velocity, ca&s;ting on every &s;ide &s;howers of brilliant &s;parkles. At &s;ight of this phenomenon the Indians put their heads between their knees, crying out in a la|mentable voice, "Do not! do not! do not!" continuing in the &s;ame attitude until the va|pour di&s;appeared. HENRY, with &s;ome &s;ur|pri&s;e, demanded the rea&s;on of this exclama|tion;
<PB N="57" REF="025208_0068_0FCCA2E2731FC0D8">
to which they replied,
<Q>What he had &s;een was a fiery dragon on his pa&s;&s;age to his den, who was of &s;o malevolent a tem|per, that he never failed, on his arrival there, to inflict &s;ome peculiar calamity on man|kind.</Q>
In about five minutes after the earth was violently agitated, the waves of the lake tumbled about in a &s;trange manner, &s;eem|ing to emit fla&s;hes of fire, all the while attend|ed with mo&s;t tremendous roarings, intermixed with loud noi&s;es, not unlike the explo&s;ion of heavy cannon. Soon as the Indians perceived it was an earthquake, they cried out,
<Q>Now he comes home!</Q>
and ca&s;ting them&s;elves in their former po&s;ture, filled the air with di&s;|mal howlings. This was a terrible &s;cene to MARIA, who had never been witne&s;s to &s;o dreadful a convul&s;ion of Nature before; &s;he &s;tarted up and fled from her &s;avage companions towards an eminence at &s;ome di&s;tance, where, dropping on her knees, &s;he emphatically im|plored the protection of Heaven: however, &s;he was followed by an Indian and HENRY; the latter, highly affected with her di&s;tre&s;&s;es, taking hold of her trembling hand,
<Q>But why, my &s;i&s;ter!</Q>
&s;aid he,
<Q>have you fled from

us? is the gloom of a fore&s;t more cheering than the &s;ympathi&s;ing looks of a friend?</Q>
"No, my brother!" replied MARIA;
<Q>but the thought was &s;ugge&s;ted to me, that the &s;upreme God perhaps was preparing to a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">enge him&s;elf of the&s;e murderers by &s;ome awful and uncommon judgment, and I fled from them as LOT did from <HI>Sodom,</HI> le&s;t I might be involved in the puni&s;hment of their guilt.</Q>
They conver&s;ed in Engli&s;h, which di&s;plea&s;ing the Indian, he ordered them to re|turn to the wigwam, threatening to bind MA|RIA fa&s;t if &s;he offered to elope again. The &s;hock being over, &s;ilence again &s;pread through the realms of darkne&s;s, when a high wind aro&s;e from the north and chilled our half-naked travellers with exce&s;&s;ive cold. The &s;avages (who&s;e callous &s;kins were proof again&s;t the in|clement weather) not caring to continue their fires, le&s;t they &s;hould be di&s;covered and &s;ur|pri&s;ed by &s;ome Engli&s;h party, they pa&s;&s;ed here a very uncomfortable night; but the wind &s;ub|&s;iding, and the &s;ky growing clear, the &s;un ro&s;e peculiarly warm and plea&s;ant, &s;treaming ten thou&s;and rays of gold acro&s;s the lake. MARIA had &s;carcely performed her orai&s;ons, when the
<PB N="59" REF="025208_0070_0FCCA2E5F608FA30">
&s;avages, forming a circle round her and HENRY, began to dance in a mo&s;t extravagant manner, and with antic ge&s;tures that at another time would have afforded mirth to our travellers. Having continued their exerci&s;e &s;ome time, they incontinently drew out boxes of paint, and began to ornament their captives with a variety of colours; one having cro&s;&s;ed their faces with a &s;troke of vermilion, another would inter&s;ect it with a line of black, and &s;o on until the whole company had given a &s;pecimen of their &s;kill or fancy.</P>
<P>Soon after two canoes arrived, in which they pa&s;&s;ed over the lake, which was uncom|monly &s;erene and plea&s;ant. They proceeded not far on their way before they were obliged to halt for two days, on account of MARIA's inability to travel, her feet being greatly &s;woln and lacerated by the flinty path. At length, by ea&s;y &s;tages, they came in view of an Indian &s;ettlement, when MARIA's long unbent fea|tures relaxed into a half &s;mile, and turning to HENRY, "Here, my brother!" &s;aid &s;he,
<Q>I &s;hall find &s;ome of my own &s;ex, to whom &s;im|ple Nature, no doubt, has taught humanity; this is the fir&s;t precept &s;he inculcates in the

female mind, and this they generally retain through life, in &s;pite of every evil propen|&s;ity.</Q>
As &s;he uttered this elogium in favour of the fair, the tawny villagers, perceiving their approach, ru&s;hed promi&s;cuou&s;ly from their huts with an execrable din, and fell upon the weary captives with clubs and a &s;hower of &s;tones, accompanying their &s;trokes with the mo&s;t virulent language; among the re&s;t an old deformed &s;quaw, with the rage of a Ti&s;i|phone, flew to MARIA, aiming a pine-knot at her head, and would certainly have given the wretched mourner her quietus had &s;he not been oppo&s;ed by the &s;avage that guarded Mrs. KITTLE: he at fir&s;t mildly expo&s;tulated with his pa&s;&s;ionate countrywoman; but finding the old hag frantic, and in&s;atiable of blood, he twi&s;ted the pine-knot from her hand and whirled it away to &s;ome di&s;tance, then &s;eizing her arm roughly and tripping up her heels, he laid her pro&s;trate, leaving her to howl and yell at lei&s;ure, which &s;he performed without a prompter.&mdash;MARIA was all in a tremor, and ha&s;tily followed her deliverer, not caring to ri&s;k another encounter with the exa&s;perated virago. By this time the rage and tumult of

the &s;avages &s;ub&s;iding, the new-comers were admitted into a large wigwam, in the center of which blazed a fire. After they were &s;eated, &s;everal young Indians entered with ba&s;kets of green maize in the ear, which, having roa&s;ted before the fire, they di&s;tributed among the company.</P>
<P>Mrs. KITTLE and her brother complaining of the brui&s;es they met with a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> their reception, an old Indian &s;eemed to attend with great con|cern; then leaving the place, in a little time returned with a bundle of aromatic herbs under his arm, the juice of which he expre&s;&s;ed by rubbing them between two &s;tones with flat &s;urfaces; this he gave them to drink, applying the leaves externally. They in&s;tantly found relief from the medical quality of this extraor|dinary plant, and compo&s;ing them&s;elves to &s;leep, expected a good night's repo&s;e; but they were mi&s;taken, for their entertainers growing intoxicated with &s;pirituous liquors, which ope|rating differently, it produced a mo&s;t compli|cated noi&s;e of yelling, talking, &s;inging, and quarrelling: this was a charm more powerful than the wand of Hermes to drive away &s;leep: but grown familiar with &s;orrow and di&s;ap|pointment, MARIA regarded this as a trifle,
<PB N="62" REF="025208_0073_0FCCA2EAC6C71F68">

The throng of people that came out to meet them, threw MARIA in the mo&s;t painful &s;en&s;ations of embarra&s;&s;ment; but as the cla|mours and in&s;ults of the populace increa&s;ed, a freezing torpor &s;ucceeded, and bedewed her limbs with a cold &s;weat&mdash;&s;trange chimeras danced before her &s;ight&mdash;the actings of her foul were &s;u&s;pended&mdash;&s;he &s;eemed to move me|chanically, nor recollected her&s;elf till &s;he found &s;he was &s;eated in the Governor's hall, &s;urrounded by an impertinent, inqui&s;itive cir|cle of people&punc; who were inquiring into the cau&s;e of her di&s;order, without attempting any thing towards her relief.

As &s;he thus moralized on her &s;ituation, an Engli&s;h woman (whom humanity more than curio&s;ity had drawn to the place) approached MARIA, and ob&s;erving her tears and deep dejection, took hold of her hand, and endeavoured to &s;mile; but the &s;oft impul&s;es of nature were too &s;trong for the efforts of di&s;&s;imulation&mdash;her features in&s;tantly &s;addened again, and &s;he bur&s;t into tears, exclaiming, (with a he&s;itating voice,)

The&s;e words were &s;ucceeded by an affecting &s;ilence on both &s;ides: meanwhile the Indians te&s;tified their impatience to be admitted to the Governor by frequent &s;houts; at length his Excellency appeared, and having held a long conference with the &s;avages, they retired with his Secretary, and our pri&s;oners &s;aw them no more.</P>

<P>HENRY was accommodated at a baker's, while his &s;i&s;ter, to her no &s;mall &s;atisfaction, found her&s;elf placed at the Engli&s;h woman's who, on her arrival, had expre&s;&s;ed &s;o much good nature.

<P>In the afternoon MARIA received her vi&s;i|tants in a neat little parlour. She was dre&s;&s;ed in a plain &s;uit of mourning, and wore a &s;mall mu&s;lin cap, from which her hair fell in artle&s;s curls on her fine neck: her face was pale, though not emaciated, and her eyes &s;treamed a &s;oft languor over her countenance, more bewitch|ing than the &s;prightlie&s;t glances of vivacity. As they entered &s;he aro&s;e, and advancing, mode&s;tly received their civilities, while Mrs. D&mdash; handed them to chairs: but hearing a well-known voice, &s;he ha&s;tily lifted up her eyes, and &s;creamed out in an accent of &s;ur|pri&s;e,

They &s;oon improved beyond my capacity of teaching. RICHARD, my elde&s;t, was pa&s;&s;ionately fond of books, which he &s;tudied with inten&s;e application. This naturally attached him to a &s;edentary life, and he became the con&s;tant in&s;tructive com|panion of my evening hours. My younge&s;t &s;on, CHARLES, was more volatile, yet not le&s;s agreeable; his per&s;on was charming, his wit &s;prightly, and his addre&s;s elegant.

<P><Q>One evening as my &s;ons were come in from reaping, and I was bu&s;ied in preparing them a di&s;h of tea, we were &s;urpri&s;ed by a di&s;charge of mu&s;kerry near us We all three ran to the door, and beheld a party of Indians not twenty paces from us. Struck with a&s;toni&s;hment, we had no power to move; and the &s;avages again firing that in|&s;tant, my CHARLES dropped down dead be&s;ide me. Good God! what were my emotions! But language would fail, &s;hould I attempt to de&s;cribe them. My &s;urviving &s;on then turning to me, with a countenance expre&s;&s;ive of the deepe&s;t horror, urged me to fly.

The Indians fired a volley at him, but mi&s;&s;ed, and, I flatter my&s;elf that he arrived &s;afe. And now, not all my prayers and tears could prevent the wretches from &s;calping my precious child. But when they rent me away from him, and dragged me from the hou&s;e, my grief and rage bur&s;t forth like a hurricane. I execrated their whole race, and called for eternal ven|geance to cru&s;h them to atoms. After a while I grew a&s;hamed of my impetuo&s;ity: the tears began again to flow &s;ilently on my cheek; and, as I walked through the fore&s;t between two Indians, my &s;oul grew &s;udden|ly &s;ick and groaned in me; a darkne&s;s, more &s;ub&s;tantial than Egyptian night, fell upon it&punc; and my exi&s;tence became an in&s;upport|able burthen to me. I looked up to Hea|ven with a hopele&s;s kind of awe, but I murmured no more at the di&s;pen&s;ations of my God; and in this frame of &s;ullen re&s;igna|tion I pa&s;&s;ed the re&s;t of my journey, which

<P><Q>I am the daughter of a poor clergyman, who being confined to his chamber by &s;ick|ne&s;s&punc; for &s;everal years, amu&s;ed him&s;elf by educating me. At his death, finding my|&s;elf friendle&s;s, and without money, I ac|cepted the hand of a young man who had taken a lea&s;ed farm in Penn&s;ylvania. He was very agreeable, and extravagantly fond of me. We lived happily for many years in a kind of frugal affluence. When the &s;avages began to commit outrages on the frontier &s;ettlements, our neighbours, intimi|dated at their rapid approaches, erected a &s;mall fort, &s;urrounded by a high pali&s;ade. Into this the more timorous drove their cat|tle at night, and one evening, as we were at &s;upper, my hu&s;band (being ordered on guard) in&s;i&s;ted that I &s;hould accompany him with the children (for I had two lovely girls, one turned of thirteen years, and an|other of &s;ix months.)

I acceded with a nod; and al|ready the dear charmer had handed me my hat and gloves, when &s;omebody thundered at the door. We were &s;ilent as death, and in&s;tantly after plainly could di&s;tingui&s;h the voices of &s;avages conferring together. Chil|led as I was with fear, I flew to the cradle, and catching my infant, ran up into a loft. SOPHIA followed me all trembling, and panting for breath ca&s;t her&s;elf in my bo&s;om.

At length, however, the flames be|ginning to invade our retreat, trembling and apprehen&s;ive, we ventured down &s;tairs; the whole hou&s;e now glowed like a furnace; the flames rolled towards the &s;tairs, which we ha&s;tily de&s;cended; but ju&s;t as I &s;at my foot on the thre&s;hold of the door, a piece of timber, nearly con&s;umed through, gave way, and fell on my left arm, which &s;upported my infant, mi&s;erably fracturing the bone.

<P>During two years, in which the French ladies continued their bounty and friend&s;hip to Mrs. KITTLE, &s;he never could gain the lea&s;t intelligence of her hu&s;band.

Being baffled in her humble attempt by the gentle reproaches of her indulgent pa|trone&s;s, &s;he &s;at down on the &s;tep of the door, and began to weep.
<Q>I believe, good Mrs. D&mdash;,</Q>
&s;aid &s;he,
<Q>were you a hard ta&s;k-ma&s;ter, that exacted from the&s;e u&s;ele&s;s hands the mo&s;t &s;lavi&s;h bu&s;ine&s;s, I could acquit my|&s;elf with cheerfulne&s;s: my heart is like ice, that brightens and grows firmer by tempe&s;ts, but cannot &s;tand the warm rays of a kind. &s;un.</Q>
Mrs. D&mdash; was beginning to an|&s;wer, when hearing a tumult in the &s;treet, they both ha&s;ted to the door, and MARIA, ca&s;ting her eyes carele&s;&s;ly over the crowd, in an in&s;tant recognized the features of her long-lamented hu&s;band, who &s;prang towards her with an un|de&s;cribable and involuntary rapture: but the tide of joy and &s;urpri&s;e was too &s;trong for the delicacy of her frame: &s;he gave a faint excla|mation, and &s;tretching out her arms to receive him, dropped &s;en&s;ele&s;s at his feet. The &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion
<PB N="83" REF="025208_0094_0FCCA30B70ED8728">
of his ideas was too rapid to admit de&s;cribing. He caught her up, and bearing her in the hall, laid his precious burden on a &s;ettee, kneeling be&s;ide her in a &s;peechle&s;s a|gony of delight and concern. Meanwhile the &s;pectators found them&s;elves wonderfully affect|ed&mdash;the tender contagion ran from bo&s;om to bo&s;om&mdash;they wept aloud; and the hou&s;e of joy &s;eemed to be the hou&s;e of lamentation. At length MARIA opened her eyes and bur&s;t into a violent fit of tears&mdash;Mr. KITTLE, with an&s;wering emotions, &s;ilently accompanying her; then cla&s;ping his arms endearingly round her, "It is enough, my love," &s;aid he,
<Q>we have had our night of affliction, and &s;urely this ble&s;&s;ed meeting is a pre&s;age of a long day of future happine&s;s; let me ki&s;s off tho&s;e tears, and &s;hew by your &s;miles that I am indeed welcome.</Q>
MARIA then bending fondly forward to his bo&s;om, replied, &s;ighing,
<Q>Alas! how can your beggared wife give you a proper reception? &s;he cannot re&s;tore your prattling babes to your arms&mdash;&s;he comes a|lone! Alas! her pre&s;ence will only &s;erve to remind you of the trea&s;ures&mdash;the filial delights you have lo&s;t!</Q>

an&s;wered he,
<Q>that I &s;hould repine at the lo&s;s of my &s;maller comforts, when &s;o capital a ble&s;&s;ing as my beloved MARIA is &s;o won|derfully re&s;tored to me.</Q>
Here he was in civility obliged to ri&s;e and receive the compli|ments of Mrs. BRATT, Mrs. WILLIS, and Madame DE R&mdash;, who, hearing of his ar|rival, entered ju&s;t then, half breathle&s;s with impatience and joy. The company increa&s;|ed; an elegant dinner was prepared: in &s;hort, the day was devoted to plea&s;ure; and never was &s;atisfaction more general&mdash;fe&s;tivity glow|ed on every face, and complacency dimpled every cheek.</P>
<P>After tea MARIA withdrew in the garden, to give her beloved an account of what had be|fallen her during their &s;eparation. The elo|quence of &s;orrow is irre&s;i&s;tible. Mr. KITTLE wept, he groaned, while all impa&s;&s;ioned (with long interruptions of grief in her voice) &s;he &s;tammered through her doleful hi&s;tory; and yet &s;he felt a great &s;atisfaction in pouring her complaints into a bo&s;om who&s;e feelings were in uni&s;on with her's&mdash;they wept&mdash;they &s;miled &mdash;they mourned, and rejoiced alternately, with an abrupt tran&s;ition from one pa&s;&s;ion to another.</P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="025208_0096_0FCCA30E66BD3C80">Mr. KITTLE, in return, informed her, that having thrown him&s;elf into the army, in hopes of ending a being that grew in&s;upport|able under the reflection of pa&s;t happine&s;s, he tempted death in every action wherein he was engaged, and being di&s;appointed, gave him&s;elf up to the blacke&s;t melancholy.
<Q>This gloomy &s;cene,</Q>
he ob&s;erved,
<Q>would &s;oon have been clo&s;ed by &s;ome act of de&s;pera|tion; but one evening, &s;itting pen&s;ive in his tent, and attentively running over the cir|cum&s;tances of his misfortunes, a thought darted on his mind that po&s;&s;ibly his brother HENRY might be alive.</Q>
This was the fir&s;t time the idea of any one of his family's &s;urviving the general murder had pre&s;ented it|&s;elf to him, and he caught at the flattering &s;ug|ge&s;tion as a drowning wretch would at a plank. "Surely, &s;urely," &s;aid he,
<Q>my brother lives&mdash;it is &s;ome divine emanation lights up the thought in my &s;oul&mdash;it carries convic|tion with it: I will go after him&mdash;it &s;hall be the comfort and employment of my life to find out this dear brother&mdash;this la&s;t and only trea&s;ure.</Q>
Per&s;uaded of the reality of his fancy, he communicated his de&s;ign to a
<PB N="86" REF="025208_0097_0FCCA31015408188">
few of his military friends; but they only laughed at his extravagance, and &s;trongly di&s;|&s;uaded him from &s;o wild an undertaking. Be|ing di&s;couraged, he de&s;i&s;ted; but &s;hortly after, hearing that a company of pri&s;oners (who were enfranchi&s;ed) were returning to <HI>Quebec,</HI> he got permi&s;&s;ion to accompany them. After a very fatiguing journey he arrived at <HI>Mon|treal,</HI> and was immediately introduced to the General Officer, who patiently heard his &s;tory, and treated him with great clemency. Hav|ing obtained leave to remain a few days in town, he re&s;pectfully withdrew, and turning down a &s;treet he inquired of a man who was walking before him, where lodgings were to be let? The &s;tranger turned about, civilly taking off his hat, when Mr. KITTLE, &s;tart|ing back, grew as pale as a&s;hes&mdash;
<Q>Oh, my God!</Q>
cried he, panting,
<Q>oh! HENRY, is it you! is it indeed you! No, it cannot be.</Q>
Here he was ready to fall; but HEN|RY, with little le&s;s agitation, &s;upported him; and a tavern being at hand, he led him in. The ma&s;ter of the hotel brought in wine, and they drank off many gla&s;&s;es to congratulate &s;o happy a meeting. When their tran&s;ports were
<PB N="87" REF="025208_0098_0FCCA31176489B40">
abated, HENRY ventured to tell him that his MARIA was living and well. This was a weight of joy too &s;trong for his enfeebled pow|ers&mdash;he &s;tared wildly about. At length, re|covering him&s;elf, "Take care, HENRY," &s;aid he, "this is too tender a point to trifle upon." &mdash;"My brother," replied HENRY,
<Q>be calm, let not your joy have a wor&s;e effect than your grief&mdash;they both came &s;udden, and it behoves a man and a chri&s;tian to &s;hew as much fortitude under the one as the other.</Q>
&mdash;<Q>Alas! I am prepared for &s;ome woeful de|ception,</Q>
cried Mr. KITTLE; but, "HEN|RY, this &s;u&s;pence is cruel."&mdash;<Q>By the eter|nal God!</Q>
rejoined his brother,
<Q>your MARIA, your wife, is in this town, and if you are compo&s;ed enough, you &s;hall imme|diately &s;ee her.</Q>
Mr. KITTLE could not &s;peak&mdash;he gave his hand to HENRY, and while (like the Apo&s;tles friends) he believed not for joy, he was conducted to her arms, and found his bli&s;s wonderfully real.</P>

<HEAD>THE STORY OF HENRY AND ANNE. FOUNDED ON FACT.</HEAD>
<P>HENRY and ANNE were born in <HI>Ger|many,</HI> in the Marqui&s;ate of <HI>Bade<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"></HI> their pa|rents dwelt contiguous to each other, and the mo&s;t &s;entimental friend&s;hip &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between the two families. ANNE was graceful even in infancy; HENRY tall and maje&s;tie, &s;trong and active, though not regularly beautiful their poverty early introduced them on the fields: their little hands were lacerated by the bearded grain, and their tender feet wounded by the a&s;perities of a flinty &s;oil. ANNE's lovely complexion &s;oon lo&s;t its delicate white|ne&s;s, but was amply recompen&s;ed by the bloom
<PB N="90" REF="025208_0100_0FCC8EB69044F290">
of luxuriant health. Whil&s;t they toiled to|gether in gathering the &s;tones from the green &s;urface of a meadow, or weeding the vines, the courtly pa&s;&s;enger would &s;top and gave with pity to &s;ee &s;o much elegance and beauty of form joined to the &s;ervility of unremitted la|bour. HENRY redoubled his exertions con|&s;tantly to le&s;&s;en little ANNE's fatigue; and when their ta&s;k was done, they rejoined their companions, a&s;&s;i&s;ted them to complete their work, and with gleeful hearts &s;ported them|&s;elves to &s;leep.</P>
<P>Nor were the old farmers di&s;plea&s;ed to &s;ee the growing affection between their children: "We &s;hall &s;oon be clo&s;er united," &s;aid they:
<Q>HENRY and ANNE (our only offspring) &s;hall cement our friend&s;hip, and perpetuate our names to remote&s;t centuries.</Q>
Alas! in the mid&s;t of this inchanting vi&s;ion, an of|ficer, attended by a file of mu&s;queteers, de|manded HENRY. He was now &s;eventeen, full grown, and mu&s;t enter his Lord's &s;ervice. It was in vain to expo&s;tulate. Without a fare|well &s;igh from ANNE, or &s;carce an embrace from his di&s;tracted parents, he mu&s;t depart. Being e&s;corted to a di&s;tant town, he was there
<PB N="91" REF="025208_0101_0FCC8EB7F4076988">
initiated into all the military manoeuvers, and three weeks after joined his regiment, which left that part of <HI>Germany</HI> &s;oon after. HENRY's di&s;appointed love &s;unk him into melancholy&mdash; he grew <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">perate, and negligent of life. In a very warm action, being engaged with the enemy in &s;ight of the General, he vent<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">red him&s;elf ra&s;hly, and fought without caution. It was called intrepidity, and he was advanc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d to the rank of &s;erjeant.

<Q>I blu&s;h to decline my officer's generous pro|po&s;al,</Q>
&s;aid HENRY;
<Q>but it is better to be virtuous than fortunate&mdash; I have left three broken hearts at home, I mu&s;t ha&s;ten to heal them&mdash;the &s;oft voice of my ANNE calls me from the thunder of <HI>Bellona.</HI></Q>&mdash;"Go," &s;aid his commander in a &s;oftened tone,

then dropping a tear,
<Q>Go HENRY&mdash;farewell&mdash;I know you de|&s;erve to be happier than I am.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="025208_0102_0FCC8EC335AD8BF0">The interview between the lovers was ten|der and romantic.&mdash;ANNE, to con&s;ole her HENRY's parents, remitted not her a&s;&s;iduities to plea&s;e them. She cultivated their garden; &s;he culled the riche&s;t fruit and brighte&s;t flowers to amu&s;e them: her active fingers extended an imperceptible thread of flax to provide them linen of finer texture than the product of Egyptian looms: &s;he re&s;i&s;ted the importunity of HENRY's rivals heroically, while her old father, weeping for joy, commended her con|&s;tancy. "My child," &s;aid he,
<Q>thou art no di&s;grace to thy lineage; HENRY loves thee, he is worthy of thee, and worthy of every &s;acrifice thou can&s;t make him; cheer up my little one, he will &s;oon return.</Q>&mdash;<Q>No, my father, &s;ome inexorable &s;hot will cleave his brave heart.</Q>
So &s;aying, &s;he ro&s;e agi|tated from weeding a bed of lupins, when a foot &s;oldier approached. Scarce had the old man civilly acco&s;ted the &s;tranger over the hedge, when ANNE &s;creamed out,
<Q>Oh heaven! father, it is our HENRY, our own HEN|RY.</Q>&mdash;In an in&s;tant the family was con|vened; from tears they made abrupt tran&s;itions to mirth, which &s;oon caught the cars of the
<PB N="93" REF="025208_0103_0FCC8EC568BF51F8">
good neighbours, who came in crouds to feli|citate the &s;oldier's arrival. His parents invited them to return the next day and &s;hare the ge|neral fe&s;tivity, which they freely accepted, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted to &s;laughter the poultry and fatte&s;t lambs. The entertainment was truly pa&s;toral. The tables were &s;pread in the vineyard, be|neath verdant arches that were impurpled by weighty clu&s;ters of grapes; a gu&s;hing fountain clo&s;e by di&s;pen&s;ed a delicious coolne&s;s, and ba&s;|kets of flowers filled the air with balmy &s;weet|ne&s;s. To heighten the &s;cene, the &s;ilvery airs of mu&s;ic, from the violin, harp, and melli|fluous flute, &s;oftly circled through the &s;ky. In &s;hort, a prie&s;t was called and our lovers married.</P>
<P>For two years peace and plenty were their hou&s;hold gods; but then HENRY &s;eeing a fa|mily increa&s;ing, began to reflect on the means of &s;upporting them. He had no land, and had never been taught any mechanical branch of bu&s;ine&s;s; however, after taking advice, he purcha&s;ed a &s;mall &s;tock of merchandi&s;e, and prepared to follow the army. The good parents exhau&s;ted them&s;elves to increa&s;e his commodities. "Be frugal and cautious, &s;on,"
<PB N="94" REF="025208_0104_0FCC8EC6EC0E32C0">
&s;aid they; "remember ANNE and her babe." &mdash;"Ah!" cried HENRY, embracing them,
<Q>if I di&s;honour my parents, take ANNE from my bo&s;om, give my paradi&s;e to a &s;tranger, and let me die the death of a villain!</Q></P>
<P>HENRY vi&s;ited his beloved friends frequent|ly, but the army being &s;tationed at a con&s;ider|able di&s;tance from them, after an interval of three years, he &s;ighed in ab&s;ence near eleven months; he had accumulated eight hundred pounds in ca&s;h by extraordinary application, which compen&s;ated in &s;ome mea&s;ure this pain|ful &s;eparation, when he received a &s;ummons to return home. It &s;eems his father-in-law had been di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of his farm, through inabi|lity to di&s;charge his rent. The good old man retired with his child to HENRY's parents, where they were cordially received; but grief made in&s;en&s;ible inroads in his con&s;titution; in le&s;s than three weeks (having langui&s;hed a few days) he died in ANNE's arms.</P>
<P>HENRY bur&s;t into tears at the news.
<Q>Cru|el parent,</Q>

<Q>you knew my happy &s;ituation&mdash;why did you let the canker of di&s;appointment abridge your days? my trea|&s;ure was your own&mdash;I am infinitely your

debtor&mdash;I never yet earned my RACHEL.</Q>
&mdash;Having paid a tribute of &s;incere drops of gratitude and love, he &s;ighed and went to bed; he &s;lumbered, and &s;aw his ANNE &s;mile with joy at the gold and &s;ilver he poured at her feet: his little ones climbed his knees, and &s;eemed to be delighted with the glitter of his trea&s;ures: his enamoured fancy called up every plea&s;ing idea to &s;port round his innocent family, when he was &s;uddenly awaked by four ruffians, who entered his tent well armed; and, advancing to his bed, bade him be &s;ilent, at the peril of immediate de&s;truction. Regardle&s;s of their menaces, he &s;tarted up and demanded their bu&s;ine&s;s; upon which they &s;eized and bound him hand and foot, then fell to rummaging the tent. They &s;oon di&s;covered his money&mdash; what a glorious booty! In vain did he plead, &s;oothe, and threaten.
<Q>Leave me a few pieces: leave me but a little, a very little, to carry me to my poor wife and children.</Q>
His rhetoric made no impre&s;&s;ion&mdash;they left him not a &s;ous.</P>
<P>Being at &s;ome di&s;tance from the camp, his repeated calls for help were not heard; at length, in the &s;ilence of midnight, a centinel
<PB N="96" REF="025208_0106_0FCC8EC9F641BD70">
di&s;tingui&s;hed a mournful cry for a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and &s;ent a couple of veterans to reconnoitre&punc; HENRY, now relieved from corporeal con|finement, began to feel his heart contracted and &s;hrunk by ideas of approaching beggary. He looked round him; the whole creation &s;eemed comfortle&s;s and de&s;olate.
<Q>How &s;hall I behold my dome&s;tic ble&s;&s;ings? how &s;hall I look ANNE in the face? would to God I had tilled &s;ome &s;terile &s;pot of ground, we would have been content in indigence; na|ture would have been &s;atisfied with herbs and lentils. Cur&s;ed ambition to be rich has ruined me, and I am a traitor to my fami|ly.</Q>
With the&s;e bitter reflections the day broke, and having collected the little furniture of his tent, he di&s;po&s;ed of it to advantage to the humane &s;oldiery, who univer&s;ally loved him and pitied his misfortunes. Having &s;e|cured his ca&s;h in a &s;mall bag, he &s;et off with a reluctant &s;tep for home. In vain did the birds carol on the elms that &s;haded the road. In vain did the ploughman whi&s;tle gleefully, and the lambs wanton o'er the green hillocks. No enlivening &s;cene could di&s;&s;ipate his melan|choly.</P>
<P><PB N="97" REF="025208_0107_0FCC8ED9B002B5E0">He protracted his journey through fear of being too &s;oon the me&s;&s;enger of ill tidings. On the &s;econd day at noon, having bought a loaf of bread, he &s;at down by a rivulet to eat; his tears flowed apace, and he began to deli|berate whether he &s;hould return to ANNE or not. He counted his little &s;tore, and fell li&s;t|le&s;s on the gra&s;s through de&s;pondency. While thus he lay &s;adly ruminating, a hand&s;ome cou|ple (thinking them&s;elves unob&s;erved) pa&s;&s;ed through the bu&s;hes. "Alas!" &s;aid the man,
<Q>for &s;ix years my EMMA you have &s;u&s;tained the mo&s;t bitter poverty with your unfortu|nate hu&s;band. My heart breaks under the oppre&s;&s;ion of your mi&s;ery; I cannot bear it &mdash;return I be&s;eech you, to the Baron; a&s;k his fatherly forgivene&s;s; he will rein&s;tate you to favour&mdash;and lovely EMMA I &s;hall die content.</Q>&mdash;"I &s;mile," replied the fair one,
<Q>at your ignorance: gold and gems and banquets have no charms for me; my heart was formed for &s;ocial happine&s;s; I love you, and deprived of your company I &s;hould langui&s;h and die, whereas I feel no unea&s;ine&s;s at the ab&s;ence of riches; we have enough to &s;ub&s;i&s;t comfortably on,
<PB N="98" REF="025208_0108_0FCC8EDB284D42C0">
though it be coar&s;e; &s;o pray, my dear, drop this unwelcome delicacy.</Q>
Here they went out of hearing, and HENRY, &s;truck with the lady's &s;entiments, began to re&s;ume courage. "I am a&s;hamed," &s;aid he,
<Q>at my want of fortitude; here is voluntary po|verty accepted in preference of an anxious mind: &s;urely ANNE will have as much philo&s;ophy in that article as the unfortunate EMMA: what a de&s;truction have I e&s;cap|ed! had I wandered away from my de&s;olate family, we had all been mi&s;erable indeed.</Q>
So thinking, he took his pack on his &s;houlders and proceeded or his journey.</P>
<P>The fourth evening, pa&s;&s;ing lei&s;urely by his decea&s;ed parent's door, he involuntarily turned back and walked in. Here his feelings received a new &s;hock. Strange faces acco&s;ted him&mdash;rudene&s;s and dirt had u&s;urped the place where ANNE once reigned the godde&s;s of ci|vility and neatne&s;s. The green inclo&s;ure, &s;urrounded by je&s;&s;amine, was trampled on by &s;wine, and lean cattle browzed on the vines that mantled over ANNE's window. He turn|ed with grief and di&s;gu&s;t from this mortifying &s;cene, and had gone but a little farther, when
<PB N="99" REF="025208_0109_0FCC8EDE182C04D0">
ANNE de&s;crying him at a di&s;tance, flew like a bird acro&s;s the meadow, and fell into his arms. After the fir&s;t emotions of tran&s;port were &s;ub&s;ided, HENRY affectionately em|braced his lovely babes and tender parents, who met him on the road.
<Q>I mi&s;s but one from this beloved company,</Q>

<Q>My HENRY, you will mi&s;s the chief of our good neigh|bourhood&mdash;our indulgent old Lord is dead; his tyrannical heir oppre&s;&s;es his tenants with heavy rents and &s;evere exactions, and they have unanimou&s;ly agreed to &s;helter them|&s;elves from this great burden, by flying to the wilds of <HI>America.</HI></Q></P>
<P>After they were &s;eated in the hou&s;e,

<Q>is true; and your aged parents would have al&s;o been forced to venture their trembling limbs and grey hairs over the dangerous ocean, had not our ble&s;&s;ed HENRY's indu&s;|try &s;ecured us a competency.</Q>
This trial was too &s;evere. HENRY changed counte|nance, and ca&s;t his eyes around with an alarming wildne&s;s.
<Q>What is the matter with my child?</Q>
cried his mother. Alas!
<PB N="100" REF="025208_0110_0FCC8EF4E2BF8200">
this encounter was too &s;udden.
<Q>Old and experienced as I am, I feel almo&s;t over|come with joy my&s;elf.</Q>&mdash;"Ah!" ex|claimed her &s;on (recollecting him&s;elf)
<Q>fain would I conceal from &s;uch endearing friends the motive of my di&s;tre&s;s; but I &s;hould ex|pire in the effort: forgive and pity a wretch who brings home nothing but mi&s;ery&mdash; who can &s;ee his family fall to ruin, and yet live.</Q>&mdash;All a&s;toni&s;hed they gazed at each other in &s;ilence, while HENRY &s;obbed, un|able to articulate a word.

<Q>Keep us not in &s;u&s;|pence, my hu&s;band; pour your griefs into our bo&s;oms, and wrong us not by re&s;erve; you can never bring mi&s;ery to us whil&s;t you remain virtuous and loving as now.</Q>&mdash; HENRY cla&s;ped the &s;ad orator with pa&s;&s;ionate fondne&s;s in his arms; and after a little he&s;ita|tion acquainted them with the particulars of his misfortune.</P>
<P>It was in vain to try to conceal their &s;urpri&s;e and di&s;oppointment, though HENRY's afflic|tion forbad them to fall into repining, or any expre&s;&s;ion of di&s;content. By degrees their

chagrin &s;ub&s;ided. The poor acquie&s;ce with greater re&s;ignation to calamity than the rich, who &s;eldomer meet with di&s;appointment. At la&s;t, by an in&s;en&s;ible gradation, our pen&s;ive a&s;&s;ociates became ble&s;t and ea&s;y. A &s;mall re|pa&s;t was provided, and &s;hutting out corro&s;ive Care, they indulged the hour of fe&s;tivity with as much glee as if the robbers had re&s;tored the money ten fold.</P>
<P>The &s;tory of HENRY's robbery was &s;oon known, and his parents concluded that their Lord would &s;hew &s;ome lenity to them; but finding him invariably cruel and oppre&s;&s;ive, they began to attend to the flattering informa|tions about the New World.&mdash;"At lea&s;t," &s;aid ANNE,
<Q>we &s;hall go into a land of &s;im|plicity&mdash;the artle&s;s &s;avages &s;ub&s;i&s;t not by rapine and deceit: pride and hypocri&s;y and avarice are &s;trangers where luxury and titles are unknown.</Q>&mdash;The old man di&s;|&s;ented from this opinion.
<Q>Wherever the print of human foot&s;teps have appeared, there certainly, my child, all human vices follow, though often under different appel|latives; however, we mu&s;t hazard this ad|venture. As the Lepers &s;aid at <HI>Samaria</HI>&punc;

<P>The en&s;uing week, as they were merrily chatting on the green before the door, a &s;ud|den cloud over&s;pread the heavens with black|ne&s;s, which &s;oon fell in a torrent of rain, in|termingled with thunder and lightning. The family retired in the hou&s;e; but HENRY ha&s;t|ed to drive the cattle and &s;heep to a place of &s;ecurity. All wet and dropping with rain he was returning to the hou&s;e, when an elegant phaeton, attended by a number of dome&s;tics, &s;topped at the gate. A gentleman handed out a lady, who &s;eemed much affrighted with the &s;torm, and conducted her, with a delicate ten|derne&s;s, to the door. HENRY opened it wide, and bowing to the ground, de&s;ired them to walk in, pre&s;enting them each with a chair. The noble air, and rich dre&s;&s;es of the new gue&s;ts, awed our humble ru&s;tics, who &s;carcely dur&s;t lift up their eyes at them, until the gen|tleman, &s;aluting the lady, inquired how his fair EMMA did after her fright. HENRY then in&s;tantly recollecting the lady's countenance, with a mode&s;t apology for his boldne&s;s, re|counted

<P><Q>I am the only child of the pre&s;ent Baron of <HI>Schauffhou&s;en,</HI> who was particularly cau|tious that my education &s;hould render me up an accompli&s;hed lady to the world. On my fir&s;t introduction into the <HI>grande monde,</HI> I found my&s;elf encompa&s;&s;ed by admirers, who&s;e addre&s;&s;es I permitted from vanity; but advancing to my twentieth year, my father grew &s;olicitous that I &s;hould &s;elect a hu&s;band from the number. It was in vain to remon&s;trate to him that my heart was di&s;|engaged. He in&s;i&s;ted on my accepting a

<P><Q>Seven months after this I became ac|quainted with my pre&s;ent hu&s;band; and not doubting but that the Baron would accede to our union, I permitted the mo&s;t violent love to &s;teal into my bo&s;om.

In ten minutes I received this note&mdash;</P>
<LETTER>

</LETTER>
<P><Q>I wept ince&s;&s;antly on the peru&s;al of this cruel billet. I wrote one to my lover, de|&s;iring him to forget me; but before I could di&s;patch it, my cou&s;in CHARLOTTE enter|ed
<PB N="105" REF="025208_0115_0FCCA3176C1E99F8">
the room in great confu&s;ion.</Q>
<Q>Begone, EMMA,</Q>
&s;aid &s;he,
<Q>your father is exa&s;|perated to a degree of madne&s;s. He bide me to give you this pur&s;e of pi&s;toles, and commands you to quit the ca&s;tle in&s;tantly.</Q>
&mdash;"Alas!" &s;aid I, &s;inking on the floor,
<Q>I &s;acrifice my love to my duty. My dear cou&s;in, tell my old parent I am no longer a rebel to his will.</Q>
Here I wept bitter|ly;
<Q>but the cruel CHARLOTTE called out, Here, JOSEPH, if the chai&s;e is ready, hand your young lady in. I am commi&s;&s;ioned, dear EMMA, to wait on you to another lodging. The angry Baron is from home, and I forfeit his favour if I do not oblige you to &s;ubmit.</Q>&mdash;I then ro&s;e from my
<Q>knees, and &s;ullenly giving my hand to her, &s;aid faintly,
<Q>I &s;ee, CHARLOTTE, you have &s;upplanted me; your undermining arts have ruined me.</Q>
She made no reply, and I &s;uffered my&s;elf to be conducted to the chai&s;e. In two hours we came to a neat farm-hou&s;e. CHARLOTTE formally took leave of me, and I was &s;hewn to a &s;mall, clean apartment, where, in a fit of agonizing de&s;|pair, I threw my&s;elf upon a little bed.
<PB N="106" REF="025208_0116_0FCCA318E924F580">
The woman of the hou&s;e, coming in, in|formed me that CHARLOTTE had advanced the pay for my year's board at her hou&s;e; and concluding I was &s;ome refractory child, gave me a long lecture on obedience to pa|rents. I &s;carcely heard her.</Q></P>
<P><Q>After a few days I wrote to my father. I begged the interce&s;&s;ion of my relations, but in vain; CHARLOTTE had &s;topped up every avenue to mercy. Finding my&s;elf rejected totally, I at length yielded to the emotions of a &s;oft pa&s;&s;ion, and accepted the hand of my pre&s;ent hu&s;band. We lived happily during &s;ix years, when, being &s;eized with a pleu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i&s;y, my phy&s;ician made a report of my danger and poverty to my father. We had a &s;mall hut on the common. The Baron's coach drove up to the door. He &s;tooped as he entered, and walked cautiou&s;|ly over the loo&s;e uneven floor of my poor bed-room. I ro&s;e up &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee him; and as I &s;at leaning again&s;t a pillow, the old man, in a gu&s;h of grief and remor&s;e, fell on my bed &s;obbing and unable to &s;peak. My two little ones &s;eeing me weep, came up with vi&s;ible concern. The elde&s;t ki&s;&s;ed

<Q>Don't cry any more, mamma, Mrs. MORELY has &s;ent us bread and milk enough for two days.</Q>
Here the Baron redoubled his &s;ighs and &s;eemed nearly &s;uffocated, when I feebly bent towards him. O my father! am I then forgiven?</Q>
But
<Q>what he replied I know not&mdash;I fainted on the pillow. To be &s;hort, he took us all home. CHARLOTTE's indi&s;cretions drew the odium of the family on her, and a bro|ken lieutenant carried her off to <HI>England.</HI> My father became exce&s;&s;ively fond of my &s;pou&s;e and children, and we are now upon a vi&s;it to an old aunt, who lays a dying, and to whom I am &s;ole heire&s;s. My friends,</Q>
<Q>continued &s;he, <Q>I &s;ee by your looks my hi&s;tory is not impertinent, and I acknow|ledge my&s;elf yet indebted to HENRY for his obliging partiality to me.</Q></Q></P>
<P>ANNE, with plea&s;ed looks, immediately &s;pread a table with a clean diaper cloth, and placed on it &s;everal earthen plates, filled with the mo&s;t delicious fruits, &s;ome bi&s;cuits, a plate with honey-combs, and a fla&s;k of wine; while HENRY, bowing low, thanked the lady for the honour &s;he had done him.
<Q>I ble&s;s the Almighty,</Q>

<Q>for &s;o &s;ignally

The gentleman &s;miled&mdash;<Q>And many a &s;enti|mental mind, my HENRY,</Q>

handing him a pur&s;e with twenty pi&s;toles. HENRY, amid the highe&s;t confu&s;ion of blu&s;hing gratitude, re|ceived the gift gracefully, and pre&s;&s;ed his be|nefactors to accept of his little regale. When they had eat, the &s;un began to &s;hine out with new lu&s;tre after the rain, and EMMA propo&s;ed to proceed on their journey. She took a ten|der leave of HENRY, and ki&s;&s;ing ANNE, &s;tept into the carriage, which in&s;tantly drove out of &s;ight.</P>
<P>Soon after this agreeable interview, they prepared for their long voyage. The pen&s;ive

neighbours a&s;&s;embled, and having delivered their ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tle to the Marquis's &s;teward, they all embarked in a &s;mall ve&s;&s;el on the <HI>Rhine.</HI> After a tedious &s;ail down the river, they were taken aboard a &s;hip bound for <HI>New-York,</HI> in <HI>America.</HI> A fair wind &s;prung up; they &s;oon lo&s;t &s;ight of the Imperial &s;hores, and found them&s;elves &s;ur|rounded by a horizon of waters. The poor cottagers viewed the uncommon &s;cene with plea&s;ure, mixed with dread; but in a few days were accu&s;tomed to the pro&s;pect, and great agitation of the ve&s;&s;el. HENRY, to le&s;&s;en the expence, had conditioned to work out his pa&s;|&s;age; but he could procure only very indiffe|rent accommodations for his family, the &s;hip being &s;o crouded. After a few weeks &s;ail ANNE's elde&s;t &s;on &s;ickened and died, and the mournful parents, with agonizing hearts, com|mitted the babe of their hopes, the darling of their bo&s;oms, to the waves.
<Q>There &s;inks my child,</Q>
cried ANNE, weeping,
<Q>in the depth of the wild ocean: in&s;tead of &s;lumber|ing in my arms, he is gone to be the food of &s;ea mon&s;ters.</Q>
HENRY &s;upported and comforted her.

Wi&s;ely and mercifully has Providence pro|portioned our &s;ufferings to our &s;trength, and given the lenient hand of Time power to mollify tho&s;e griefs he cannot cure.</Q>
In a little &s;pace ANNE's &s;orrows &s;unk into a lan|guid &s;erenity. She began to &s;mile as u&s;ual, and HENRY was happy.</P>
<P>They had a tedious pa&s;&s;age; but at length, one moon&s;hine night, the &s;ailors cried out, "land!" In a moment they all crouded upon deck: it was very calm, and near day: a gen|tle &s;outh breeze aro&s;e &s;oon after, and by &s;un|ri&s;e they clearly di&s;tingui&s;hed the little i&s;lands covered with verdure, and the white beach on the bold continent. As they &s;ailed up the Narrows, with a f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ir wind, the &s;trangers admired the beauty of the country, which they little expected to find &s;o well cultivated.

They got on &s;hore, and the &s;ailor procured for HENRY's little family a de|cent apartment in Beaver-&s;treet. HENRY ex|pre&s;&s;ed his acknowledgments to the generous &s;ailor, for he really found he &s;hould never have been able, in his uncouth broken language, to make the people under&s;tand him.</P>
<P>Here HENRY left his little family while he went to &s;eek a &s;pot on the vacant lands of this &s;tate, where he might accommodate them. He &s;ailed with a Dutch &s;kipper to <HI>Albany,</HI> and being informed by him where he might find &s;uch a place as he wi&s;hed for, he &s;et off early the morning after his arrival on foot.

<P>YOUR letter was more acceptable to me than the &s;miles of the returning &s;pring after this long rigid winter; (and indeed your &s;ilence contributed to make it more tedious.) But I wonder what caprice of fortune intercepts all my epi&s;tles: &s;urely &s;he owes you &s;everal volu|minous pacquets which I committed to her care. And &s;ince I am in a vein of wondering, I wonder how you could be &s;o long ignorant of the place of our KITTY's re&s;idence: her &s;tay with us was &s;hort; the charming city tempted her away: but &s;hortly after &s;he emi|grated to <HI>Halfmoon,</HI> five miles from here, where &s;he remains.</P>
<P>As to my&s;elf, I have but little to inform you, unle&s;s it &s;hould be the hi&s;tory of my heart, and even in that there is no novelty. I love the &s;ame per&s;ons, the &s;ame amu&s;ements, the &s;ame opinions I did ten years ago. But my affection is almo&s;t become a painful &s;en&s;ation to me; for, except my dear little family, all my friends are dead, or far, far ab&s;ent. This, the poet ob&s;erves, is the perqui&s;ite of long life: but my days have been evil and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ew&punc; I find no

<P>Let us change the &s;ubject.

<OPENER><SALUTE>MY DEAR SISTER,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THIS day (the anniver&s;ary of an event &s;adly important to me) awakes me from a de|ception I have admitted &s;ince our &s;eparation. I have been lo&s;ing relations, friends, children and acquaintances many years: but with the la&s;t farewell &s;alute you gave me, in the bitter|ne&s;s of grief I reproached Providence it had not left me one friend: I retired hither, with my very little family, mourning, and could not help repeating the words of HEZEKIAH, "I &s;hall go &s;oftly all my days."&mdash;Your letters, PEGGY's and MARIA's I have re|ceived, often read, and wept over; but, con|&s;cious that my gloomy ideas would be un&s;ea|&s;onable
<PB N="160" REF="025208_0169_0FCCA3632B66A050">
in the circle of plea&s;ure, I omitted an&s;wering as much as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>But this day tells me I have yet a kind com|panion, who might now have lain fettered in a dungeon, had not Providence interpo&s;ed. I have an endearing child, who might have now lain in the dark grave, if the &s;ame mercy had not re&s;tored her. And in &s;pite of habit, gra|titude &s;hall make me this day cheerful.</P>
<P>Dear SUSAN, you mu&s;t peru&s;e the above <HI>alone:</HI> the genuine &s;entiments of a broken heart appear ridiculous to inexperienced levity: and though your fai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> companions are &s;weetly &s;ympathi&s;ing, their very &s;en&s;ibility induces me to conceal from them the hi&s;tory of my feel|ings.</P>
<P>The news of this place is, that Mi&s;s P&mdash; T&mdash; is married to Mr. J&mdash; P&mdash;; Mr. S&mdash; T&mdash; obliged to ab&s;cond for forgery; and Mi&s;s S&mdash; C&mdash; is like to take H&mdash; G&mdash; for better for wor&s;e.

terror to every one that &s;ees it. It &s;eems &s;he was &s;truck with &s;o much horror at the &s;ight of JAMES YATES's murdered family, that it made too fatal an impre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>I had almo&s;t forgot to mention, that &s;imple BETT HERMAN is married to a He&s;&s;ian: Mr. B. officiated as prie&s;t, and I gave the happy couple a wedding-dinner, to which we invited our mo&s;t civilized neighbours. E. and G. lodge here alternately, to guard Mr. B. and beg their regards may be pre&s;ented you.</P>
<P>To return to my&s;elf&mdash;an unimportant and almo&s;t forgotten &s;ubject&mdash;I have been em|ployed during the winter and &s;pring in attend|ing to my health, which has been con&s;iderably impaired and weather-beaten by the &s;torms of affliction.
<Q><L>For who to dumb Forgetfulne&s;s a prey,</L>

Forgive my relap&s;ing into melancholy: I will make one more exertion to be lively, and if I cannot &s;ucceed, will conclude my paper.</P>
<P>I have the fine&s;t garden in the country. In the center of four gra&s;s walks we have erected
<PB N="162" REF="025208_0171_0FCCA366587A6738">
a &s;pacious arbour, clo&s;ely &s;haded with annual vines, where we often drink tea, and enjoy the pro&s;pect of a lovely collection of flowers on one hand, and a cool &s;hady orchard on the other; a luxuriant lot of herbage behind, and directly oppo&s;ite a blu&s;hing vineyard in minia|ture. Here, often, when peru&s;ing THEOCRI|TUS, TASSO, and VIRGIL, I drop tho&s;e pa&s;|toral enthu&s;ia&s;ts, to reflect on the hours of friend&s;hip I have pa&s;&s;ed with my SUSAN: my cheek then glows with delight, plea&s;ure deli|cately touches my nerves, and all the &s;prings of life mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e on cheerily. Ah, SUSAN! I love you more than you imagine. Wherefore are we &s;eparated? if for your advantage, I am more than re&s;igned, I am contented.</P>
<P>Do you never hear of SAMMY? does he not write to you? Though I dwell in the depth of a va&s;t fore&s;t, that need not limit his love: the &s;till voice of affection cannot be lo&s;t in the thunder of war. What can be the rea&s;on he forgets me? I mu&s;t either entertain a con|tempt of my own demerits, or this&mdash;but love and partiality forbid a deci&s;ion.</P>
<P>After all, my SUSAN, I will endeavour to circum&s;cribe my happine&s;s to the little lovely

<P>What ails the lads in your quarter? They mu&s;t be very in&s;en&s;ible, or you three fair nymphs very cruel, or Hymen &s;urely would light his taper at <HI>R</HI>&mdash;. If this vein of celibacy continues, I would advi&s;e to erect a cloi&s;ter, and then your nominal Lady Abbe&s;s would have &s;omething to do; the Mi&s;s W.'s would be large contributors, as they have taken the veil thirty years ago. But lea&s;t the con|finement of a number of beauties in a nunnery &s;hould cau&s;e an in&s;urrection in the <HI>beau monde,</HI> we mu&s;t al&s;o contrive to &s;hut up all the gay, &s;ighing, u&s;ele&s;s fops in a mona&s;tery; and to keep up forms and decencies, Mr. P&mdash; H&mdash;, a &s;uperannuated but con&s;tant adorer of the widow B. &s;hall be appointed <HI>Mon&s;ieur L' Abb&eacute;.</HI></P>

I went to &s;ee the place where they had &s;tationed them&s;elves; they had made a com|modious bed of dry leaves, and had amu&s;ed them&s;elves with plaiting gra&s;s and making true lovers knots.

<P>YOUR black eyes &s;eem to have done &s;ome execution already; but you, more cruel than the Prince&s;s of the Steel Ca&s;tle, who pitied the Knight of the Burning Pe&s;tle, have di&s;carded your STREPHON without a &s;igh.

"a pair of green &s;pectacles, with &s;ilver rima and a &s;hagreen ca&s;e," you may po&s;&s;ibly repent.</P>
<P>Dear SUSAN, you will ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;h this raillery from the undi&s;gui&s;ed &s;entiments of my heart: your letter made me feel that I am indeed your &s;i&s;ter: I love you, my SUSAN; and &s;ince your departure there is a cha&s;m in my family, at my table, at my fire-&s;ide, that is not filled to my liking by any other; but &s;o far I am happy, that you are in a family where, with proper attention, you will gain every u&s;eful, every ornamental accompli&s;h|ment.</P>
<P>Now let me tell you the news of the&s;e parts. NANNY BOSTWICK died lately of a con&s;ump|tion. I went to &s;ee the little beauty in her la&s;t moments; her piety, re&s;ignation and fortitude were very &s;triking: &s;he &s;miled di&s;approbation when, to con&s;ole her, I hinted &s;he might re|cover. Mrs. P&mdash; too lays very ill. Papa, who was here ye&s;terday, told me &s;he could not recover to all human appearance: I &s;hall vi&s;it her to-morrow, and if this paper is not &s;ealed, will let you know her true &s;ituation.&mdash;I hear Doctor BROWN is dead in <HI>Virginia</HI>; that H&mdash; is very much reduced; and that W&mdash; has

made a great fortune in <HI>New-England</HI> by pri|vateering, and improved it by a wealthy mar|riage. Undoubtedly he omits his u&s;ual que&s;|tion, "What do the ladies &s;ay of me?"&mdash; Ble&s;s me, I could fill a volume. S&mdash; C&mdash; has accidentally ble&s;t <HI>Vermont</HI> with a fatherle&s;s &s;on, and is gone to <HI>Canada.</HI> We are all well, except JOHNNY. Domine B. dre&s;&s;es like a very beau.

I &s;uppo&s;e you know that MOLLY P&mdash; is married: yes, I recollect I formerly wrote it to you.</P>
<P>All this non&s;en&s;e, my &s;weet SUSAN, will remind you of the many laughing, indolent hours we have pa&s;&s;ed, in the cool of &s;ummer evenings, on our green, where we chatted without re&s;erve or impertinent caution, and as the full moon ro&s;e bright in a cloudle&s;s &s;ky, when the &s;imple lads and la&s;&s;es were convened, we &s;ported in the innocency of childi&s;h amu&s;e|ments, and plea&s;ed and fatigued with blind|man's-buff,
<PB N="167" REF="025208_0176_0FCCA36DDFADAA38">
and hide-and-&s;eek, and pu&s;s-in-the-corner, we went &s;weetly to re&s;t.</P>
<P>SUSAN, all this little chat is for your own in&s;pection. Were you to &s;hew this letter to &s;ome belle or fop, you would be the le&s;s e&s;teem|ed for conver&s;ing with &s;uch a very ru&s;tic, &s;uch a &s;tranger to the etiquette of a polite circle. The well-bred hate &s;implicity: there is a great gulph between the vulgar adepts of nature, and the artificial, mechanical &s;ons of cere|mony.</P>
<P>To-day is my birth-day: I have made it a day of thank&s;giving to my God, who has often brought my &s;oul out of trouble, and have made it &s;acred to the memory of my be&s;t loved friends, by writing them &s;everally long letters. External rejoicing and fe&s;tivity I care not for: the &s;ecret approbation of my con&s;cience is all the prai&s;e I now &s;eek after, and more, in my e&s;teem, to be valued, than the acclamations of an empire.</P>
<P>How &s;hall I conclude this incoherent epi&s;|tle? When I begin to talk to my SUE, (for, as Mr. POPE &s;ays, this is not writing) I know not how to be &s;ilent.</P>

<P>We have had an agreeable jaunt to <HI>New-England,</HI> but in pa&s;&s;ing the mountains of <HI>Tawkanok</HI> I think I never &s;aw a more lovely &s;cene: we had a&s;cended the la&s;t declivity; the vallies below us, inter&s;per&s;ed with farms, and plains, and villages, &s;eemed to be at an in|credible depth; when we entered on a level, over&s;haded with evergreens, laurel, and hem|lock,

pine and &s;pruce, intermixed with red, blue and yellow berries&mdash;imitating the &s;ofte&s;t bowers of &s;ummer. The&s;e greens naturally &s;truck out into long vi&s;tas, through which we &s;aw the gildings of the &s;etting &s;un long after the mortals below us were &s;unk in darkne&s;s.</P>
<P>We found the people ho&s;pitable and &s;ocial; were invited cheerfully into almo&s;t every genteel hou&s;e we chanced to pa&s;s; and return|ed home, like JACOB's &s;ons from <HI>Egypt,</HI> with our money, if not in our &s;ack's mouth, at lea&s;t in our pockets: but tell SUSAN we left little BENJAMIN behind, who is preceeding to the <HI>Nine-Partners.</HI></P>
<P>I begin to find the winter tedious; my circle of friends here is too &s;mall; that of my ru&s;tic acquaintance too large: when the heart is not intere&s;ted, the mind has little &s;atisfaction in company: your own feelings will confirm my ob&s;ervation. Dear cuz, can't you contrive to vi&s;it us? In vain would the winds beat, and the hail rattle; deep &s;nows might confine us, and arctic bla&s;ts conden&s;e the atmo&s;phere; &s;till our fires &s;hould &s;parkle, plea&s;ure and joy and plenty attend us&mdash;and friend&s;hip &s;hould triumph.

of a &s;oul who&s;e feelings are too acute: the di&s;tant idea of an interview with tho&s;e whom I love elevates me beyond rea&s;on, and ten times a day I anticipate our happy meet|ing.</P>
<P>I received ye&s;terday a long letter from Mr. A&mdash;: he tells me our KITTY is <HI>increa&s;ing:</HI> po&s;&s;ibly I may inclo&s;e a letter for him: I wi&s;h &s;he would write; &s;he can (if &s;he will) chat very agreeably.

A certain Colonel told me la&s;t week that Mrs. F&mdash; u&s;ed to be a charming and in&s;tructive compa|nion, but that now &s;he was grown too fine a lady for conver&s;ation. I told him I never would believe that the tin&s;el of fortune could rob my B&mdash; of the ornaments of humanity: &s;o plea&s;e to inform her of the Colonel's malignity.</P>

<HEAD>To Mr. <HI>S***** S</HI>*******.</HEAD>
<P>I Congratulate you, my dear brother, on the peace; in con&s;equence of which I &s;incerely hope you may &s;ee many happy years: as for me, my bright pro&s;pects lie beyond the grave; I have little to promi&s;e my&s;elf on this &s;ide of eternity. Affliction has broken my &s;pirit and con&s;titution; I grow daily weaker and more emaciated, and depre&s;&s;ed with the reflection of leaving my hu&s;band and child&mdash;alas! the only trea&s;ures I have now on earth.</P>
<P>Let me talk freely to you for the la&s;t time, my brother:&mdash;You know your poor BETSEY was born a &s;olitary orphan: though enjoying a genteel fortune, yet friendle&s;s, and a wan|derer,
<PB N="178" REF="025208_0187_0FCCA37E2CC65378">
at length I found peace in the company of a tender hu&s;band. Ah, how &s;oon interrupt|ed! my lovely babes died away like &s;ummer blo&s;&s;oms before the fro&s;t: &s;till I had a kind mother to complain to; we wept together: but &s;oon the enemy ru&s;hing upon us like a hurri|cane, we were &s;cattered like a flock of frighted birds: our dear mother fled to <HI>Red-Hook</HI> with SUSAN; I &s;taid awhile at the farm; but a &s;ud|den incur&s;ion of &s;ome &s;avages ha&s;tened my re|treat; I took my beautiful ABELLA on my arm, and PEGGY by the hand, and wandered &s;olitary through the dark woods, expecting every moment to meet the bloody ally of <HI>Bri|tain:</HI> however, we arrived &s;afe at <HI>Arabia,</HI> where I met my hu&s;band, who had been to <HI>Albany</HI>; he procured a chai&s;e, and took us to the city; the alarm increa&s;ing, we got a pa&s;&s;age in a &s;loop with &s;i&s;ter SWITS and family; twelve miles below <HI>Albany</HI> my ABELLA died of a dy&s;entery; we went a&s;hore, had one of my mahogany dining-tables cut up to make her coffin, and buried the little angel on the bank. I was &s;eized with the di&s;temper; and when we came to <HI>Red-Hook,</HI> found my dear mamma wa&s;ted to a &s;hadow: &s;he mourned over the ruins of her

family, and carried me to uncle H&mdash;'s, who received us very reluctantly. Soon after my dear mother died, and I returned to <HI>Albany,</HI> where, in a few days, I &s;aw poor &s;i&s;ter CATY<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mrs. SWITS.</NOTE> expire. We retired again to <HI>Tomhanick,</HI> where we lived &s;ometime ble&s;t in dome&s;tic tranquilli|ty, though under perpetual alarms from the &s;avages: at length, one afternoon, a &s;mall party from <HI>Canada,</HI> who had unperceivedly pene|trated the country, carried off Mr. BLEECKER with his two &s;ervants. This &s;hock I could not &s;upport. My little PEGGY and I went to <HI>Albany,</HI> where we wept ince&s;&s;antly for five days, when God was plea&s;ed to re&s;tore him to our arms. Soon after I fell into premature labour, and was delivered of a dead child. Since that I have been declining; and though we often fled from the enemy &s;ince, been cruelly plundered, and often &s;uffered for very nece&s;&s;aries, yet your &s;ilence, my brother, hurts me more than the&s;e.</P>
<P>Mr. BLEECKER talks of taking me to <HI>New-York</HI> this &s;pring, but I believe I &s;hall never reach it; my health is &s;o precarious that I dare not, even here, venture an afternoon's vi&s;it. I

<HEAD>BENEFITS OF SCOLDING.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>1790.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE often wondered that among&s;t the numbers who write for the edification of the public, no one has ever thought fit to expatiate upon the <HI>Benefits of Scolding</HI>; nor can I con|ceive why an art, who&s;e origin we may trace in years before the flood, and which is &s;o much in u&s;e among the moderns&punc; &s;hould be di&s;re|garded by writers.</P>
<P>It is an ancient art, and I am per&s;uaded a very beneficial one, not only to individuals, &s;uch as hu&s;bands, wives, children, and &s;er|vants, but to the community at large. Schools, in particular, are much indebted to it; and though they may not acknowledge it, nor think it merits an eulogy from their pens, yet the flouri&s;hing &s;tate of many of our &s;eminaries &s;peaks loudly in its favour. People in general would rather &s;uffer corporeal puni&s;hment than
<PB N="266" REF="025208_0274_0FCCA3F57621C9C0">
be lectured upon their faults; and I have known many who did not mind the rod to be deterred from a continuance of their follies, merely by the la&s;hes of the tongue.</P>
<P>A &s;colding officer has often made his &s;ubal|terns as angry as hornets in an engagement; and a coward, when enraged, will fight mo&s;t courageou&s;ly. Perhaps he might have called them cowards in his ill-humour, and they, out of &s;pite, have exerted them&s;elves and per|formed wonders, which, had their leader been a tame, peaceable creature, they would have looked upon as impracticable: and we know an able politician, when a motion was made in the hou&s;e of which he was a member, preju|dicial to the &s;tate which he lived in, who not only &s;colded the hou&s;e out of countenance, but out of the motion too, and made them lay it by for years.</P>
<P>The &s;pou&s;e of SOCRATES was of a turbu|lent temper, which made his friends pity him much; but SOCRATES was a wi&s;e man, and well knowing the utility of &s;colding, told them, that &s;he taught him patiently to put up with the humours of other men.</P>
<P><PB N="267" REF="025208_0275_0FCCA3F6F440E078">Scolding is not only good for the mind but the body too. It makes re&s;piration more free, and cures colds; and by promoting per&s;piration, has been known to remove complaints of long &s;tanding. Let the following account &s;peak for it:&mdash;</P>
<P>A lady of my acquaintance was in a very ill &s;tate of health &s;ome time ago, as every body thought in a con&s;umption; but one day (as the Doctors were &s;itting by her) luckily &s;omething went wrong, and the poor invalid forgetting her reduced &s;ituation, gave vent to her feelings, and &s;colded mo&s;t eloquently, and di&s;played her talents in &s;uch a manner as rectified the mi&s;take, brought on a profu&s;e per&s;piration, and greatly relieved her. The benefits ari&s;ing from &s;uch proceedings were more than &s;he could have expected; &s;he, however, repeated it with the &s;ame &s;ucce&s;s, and is now a hearty woman.</P>
<P>But &s;ome may be apt to inquire, "If this is true, might not people live for ever were they to keep on &s;colding?" No one, I believe, has ever yet made the experiment, nor &s;hould I dare wi&s;h to propagate &s;uch an opinion; but this I know, that almo&s;t all &s;colds live to be
<PB N="268" REF="025208_0276_0FCCA3F8961244C0" MS="y">
pretty old, nor do I remember ever to have heard of a per&s;on who died &s;colding.</P>
<P>My &s;colding abilities are at pre&s;ent very &s;lender, but there is room for improvement; and it is probable, if I &s;hould make any con|&s;iderable proficiency in that &s;cience, I may favour the public with a &s;pecimen.</P>

<HEAD>FINE FEELINGS Exemplified in the Conduct of a Negro Slave.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>1791.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING what the learned Mr. JEFFERSON has &s;aid re&s;pecting the want of finer feelings in the blacks, I cannot help thinking that their &s;en&s;ations, mental and ex|ternal, are as acute as tho&s;e of the people who&s;e &s;kin may be of a different colour; &s;uch an a&s;|&s;ertion may &s;eem bold, but facts are &s;tubborn things, and had I not <HI>them</HI> to &s;upport me, it is probable I &s;hould not attempt to oppo&s;e the opinions of &s;uch an eminent rea&s;oner.</P>
<P>In the interior parts of this &s;tate lived (a few years ago) a man of property, who owned a number of blacks; but formed in Nature's

mo&s;t &s;avage mould, his chief employment was inventing puni&s;hments for his unfortunate de|pendants, and his principal delight in practi&s;|ing the tortures he had invented. Among the number of his &s;laves was an old Negro, who, in his younger days, had been a faithful &s;er|vant; but captivity and &s;orrow had at length broken his &s;pir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> and de&s;troyed that ambition which actuates the free, and gives energy and life to all they perform. This was a proper &s;ubject for the cruelty of Mr. A&mdash; to act upon. Upon the commi&s;&s;ion of the &s;malle&s;t fault, on the mo&s;t trifling neglect, he would him&s;elf tie MINGO, (as butchers do &s;heep in|tended for &s;laughter) and after having beaten him till the blood followed every &s;troke of the whip, he would retire, leaving the wretch weltering in his gore, expo&s;ed to the burning rays of &s;ummer or the gelid gales of winter. When re&s;ted he would return, and after a re|petition of his amu&s;ement, would relea&s;e the &s;ufferer, le&s;t a few more minutes of &s;uch ex|treme agonies &s;hould &s;horten the period of MINGO's woes, and his ma&s;ter's felicity. However, this mode of puni&s;hment becoming a little trouble&s;ome to Mr. A&mdash;, he thought
<PB N="270" REF="025208_0278_0FCCA3FC2F8E29F0">
of another which he believed would an&s;wer nearly as well: he cau&s;ed a large ox-chain to be made, and putting it about MINGO's wai&s;t, he brought it round his neck, and there fa&s;tened it again, leaving an end of about four yards, to which he nailed a piece of wood weighing upwards of forty weight. With this clog the &s;lave was obliged to work&mdash;and this at night was placed in the ma&s;ter's chamber, (the chain pa&s;&s;ing through a hole in the door) while MINGO &s;lept on the ground out &s;ide of the hou&s;e, from which uncomfortable couch no|thing but the mo&s;t bitter cold excu&s;ed him.</P>
<P>Seven long years did the mi&s;erable being groan under this load, when the captain of a ve&s;&s;el, hearing of his hard fate, out of pity bought him.</P>
<P>After having paid the money he went home, and &s;ending for MINGO, told him he was free:&mdash;"You are your own ma&s;ter," &s;aid the humane &s;ailor;
<Q>but you are old, and help|le&s;s&mdash;I will take care of you.</Q>&mdash;Over|powered with joy, the old man cla&s;ped the captain's knees; he wept aloud&mdash;he rai&s;ed his &s;wimming eyes to heaven&mdash;he would have &s;poken his thanks;&mdash;but his frame was too feeble for the mighty conflict of his &s;oul&mdash;he expired at his benefactor's feet!</P>
