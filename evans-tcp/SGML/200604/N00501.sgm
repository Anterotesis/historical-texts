<HEAD>January's Observation</HEAD>
<P>It is now just a year since our <HI>May Plot</HI> was discove|red, when <HI>Passive Obedience</HI> was turned into <HI>Rebellious Resistance,</HI> and a design laid to destroy the bravest Prince in the World, and this done by those who in their publick Auditories had be-rebell'd all mankind but their own faction; by those, I say at whose Doors lies all the Blood and miseries of <HI>Ireland.</HI></P>
<P>If we consider that the Ingress was attended with a Conjunction of the Sun and Mercury, and a Trine of Jupiter and the Sun; those things compared with the beginning of this month, seems to shew us much news discoursed of among all People; and especially about Peace, and such Affairs as relate thereunto, as Truces, Cessations of Arms, and the like; and do you think there is any thing in it? <HI>Vix Credo.</HI></P>
<P>For the Sun and Moon are Cadent, and the old plotting Knave Saturn is in Opposition to Mars; from the third and ninth, the house of Religion: I hope we have no more holy Plots coming abroad again, and

<P>At the Ingress in <HI>December</HI> we find the Moon void of course, but the Sum is going to the Trine of Jupi|ter, and on the Cusp of the Ascendant in Taurus, but the Sun lately separated from the Opposition of Mars, and the Body of <HI>Mercury,</HI> and this so near the Tropick, that I fear will spoil the Influence of <HI>Jupiter'</HI>s <HI>Balsa|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">uick Rays,</HI> which indeed tend to peace.</P>
