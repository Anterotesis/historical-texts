<HEAD>THE ADVENTURES OF <HI>SOCIVIZCA</HI>&mdash;A NOTO|RIOUS ROBBER AND ASSASSIN, OF THE RACE OF THE MORLACHIANS.</HEAD>
<P>MORLACHIA is a province belonging to the Vene<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">an &s;tate, lying between the Gulph of Venice, Croatia and Bo&s;nia, having Dalmatia to the South. Some reckon it a part of Croatia: the Capital town is Seng, or S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">gna. The inhabitants are inveterate ene|mies to the Turks, and never &s;pare them when they get them into their power. This will appear in the hi&s;tory of Socivizca, and is the only thing that can be urged in extenuation of his crimes, or as an excu&s;e for the conduct of the pre&s;ent Emperor of Germany, who, &s;ince the year 1776, has retained him in his &s;ervice, as <HI>Aramba&s;&s;a,</HI> an officer in his regiment of Pandours. The

Morlachians are amazingly &s;trong; travellers affirm that four of them will carry a man on hor&s;eback twen|ty or thirty paces over the mo&s;t dangerous pa&s;&s;es of the mountains. Their habits are of divers colours, quite different from tho&s;e of the Venetians, and they commonly go armed with an ax.</P>
<P>This &s;ingular man will not excite in us that horror and aver&s;ion which we generally feel in reading the lives of common thieves and murderers, nor does he de&s;erve to be con&s;idered wholly in that light, &s;ince he did not lie in wait for travellers indi&s;criminately&punc; to &s;trip and murder them, but confined his depredations and barbarity to the Turks, again&s;t whom he had a na|tive animo&s;ity, rou&s;ed and augmented by per&s;onal in|juries.</P>
<P>Before we proceed to the incidents of his life, it may be proper to &s;how, that the Morlachians of our time differ very little in their manners and cu&s;toms from the ancient inhabitants of their country, de&s;cribed thus by Ovid, in his "<HI>Epi&s;tolae ex Pento.</HI> The men that I &s;ee here (&s;ays this author) are &s;carce worthy to be called men, for they have the natural ferocity of wolves.

They live on pillage, but they fight-bravely and openly for their prey; all other means of procuring the nece&s;&s;aries of life appear to them to be ba&s;e and ignominious,. Without any fear or apprehen&s;ion of them, the &s;ight of them is alone &s;uf|ficient to create aver&s;ion. Their voice is &s;avage; their

wan and furious phy&s;iognomy is a ju&s;t repre&s;entation of death."</P>
<P>STANISLAO SOCIVIZCA was born in the year 1715, at Simiovo, in a farm hou&s;e, about &s;ixteen miles from Trebigne, a city dependant on the Ottoman empire. His father, who was in extreme indigence, labored, with three other &s;ons, in cultivating the lands of a very rich Turki&s;h family, called the <HI>Umitalcichi,</HI> and the&s;e poor people were cruelly oppre&s;&s;ed by their ma&s;ters, in&s;o|much that they not only loaded them with in&s;ults, but beat them &s;everely. Neither Socivizca, who&s;e tempera|ment was naturally &s;avage and cruel, nor his brothers, could any longer endure their repeated acts of tyranny, but their father con&s;tantly exhorted them to forbear|ance, and bound them by the ties of filial obedience to &s;ubmit, for &s;everal years, with re&s;ignation to their hard fate.</P>
<P>At length however chance threw in their way the three Turki&s;h brothers who were the chief per&s;ecutor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of the&s;e unfortunate laborers. Having ama&s;&s;ed the &s;um of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">8000 &s;equins ari&s;ing from exactions called <HI>the Arai,</HI> that is to &s;ay, the forced contributions of the inhabit|ants of &s;everal villages, their va&s;&s;als, they came to pa&s;s a few days on the farm where Socivizca and his family cultivated the lands. This favourable opportunity awak|ened their re&s;entment, and deaf to all the remon&s;tran|ces of their mild and peaceable father, they re&s;olved to avenge them&s;elves of the whole hou&s;e of the <HI>Umitalcichi</HI> in the per&s;ons of the&s;e three young men: accordingly they ma&s;&s;acred them, and buried the bodies in a deep
<PB N="6" REF="032707_0005_0FF432405F269C00">
ditch which they dug round the farm. The young men being mi&s;&s;ed, the Turki&s;h Ba&s;haw of <HI>Trebigne,</HI> and the captain of the guards arre&s;ted upwards of fifty chri&s;tians of the di&s;trict; &s;ome of whom were put to death, and others made &s;laves for not confe&s;&s;ing tho innocent, that they were criminals; but not the &s;malle&s;t &s;u&s;picion fell upon the family of <HI>Socivizca.</HI></P>
<P>It is a cu&s;tom among the Turks, that when a &s;um of money has been &s;tolen from any per&s;on, and cannot be recovered, all the inhabitants of the village or town wherein the robbery is committed are a&s;&s;embled togeth|er, and a tax is levied upon each family in proportion to their property to make up the amount; this was put in practice in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, and the neatne&s;s of <HI>So|civizca</HI>'s dre&s;s, the pride he had a&s;&s;umed, and which he had not &s;hown before, together with his temerity and audacity of which he had given frequent proofs &s;ince this event, left no doubt in the minds of the Turks that he was the murderer: but a full year had elap&s;ed before they were confirmed in this opinion.</P>
<P>Upon the fir&s;t rumour of his family being &s;u&s;pect|ed, Socivizca had advi&s;ed his brothers to retire to a di&s;tant province with the remains of the money. Ac|cordingly they all &s;led together with their father, who being very old and infirm died upon the road; and they reached <HI>Imo&s;chi</HI> a &s;mall town upon the <HI>Venetian</HI> territories. This happened in the year 1745; there they purcha&s;ed lands, built a hou&s;e, and &s;tocked a warehou&s;e with the mo&s;t valuable merchandi&s;e.</P>
<P>As for Socivizca as he did not think the &s;low re|turns

of trade, or annual rents worth his notice he re|&s;olved to return to <HI>Monte Vero,</HI> where with a &s;mall band of cho&s;en relations and friends, he commenced public robber and murderer of the Turks; in one &s;ummer they attacked, a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated and robbed forty. One of his com|rades having lo&s;t his carabine, Socivizca re&s;olved to take one by force from the fir&s;t per&s;on he met armed, but in this attempt, when he lea&s;t &s;u&s;pected it, he found him&s;elf in the mid&s;t of a Turki&s;h caravan. The guard who fir&s;t perceived him, took him for what <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e really was, an <HI>Aiduco,</HI> a name formerly given to a party of Morlachians, who devoted their whole lives to the de|&s;truction of the Turks, at pre&s;ent they call every high|way robber an <HI>Aiduco</HI>; he denied it with terrible oaths, but in vain, &s;ix other Turks &s;urrounded him, and with|out any further trial were preparing to bind him. Soci|vizca &s;eeing him&s;elf in this &s;ituation, fired a pi&s;tol as an alarm to his companions and told the Turks they con&s;i&s;ted of a large band at a little di&s;tance; at the &s;ame time he &s;houted as loud as po&s;&s;ible. The Turks took the alarm, and imagining they already &s;aw a hardy troop of veteran a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins advancing, fell back a few paces to ob&s;erve from what quarter they would come, this gave him an opportunity to e&s;cape by flight; but the Turks perceiving the &s;tratagem, pur&s;ued him with their carabines loaded. Socivizca, who knew that it was the cu&s;tom of the Turks to fire all together, and not to re&s;erve a &s;ingle carabine for an emergency, ju&s;t as they were on the point of di&s;charging their pieces, laid him&s;elf down flat on the ground, and the enemy having fired, in&s;tantly approached him think|ing

they had mortally wounded him, either in the mid|dle of his body or in the head, when ri&s;ing &s;uddenly he &s;hot one Turk, and knocked down another, with the butt end of his pi&s;tol, then recollecting that he had an|other pi&s;tol loaded he di&s;patched him.</P>
<P>In the interval his comrades joined him, and the five remaining Turks took to their heels. The caravan now came up, and tho Socivizca and his companions had no inclination to let &s;o rich a body e&s;cape them, they found it &s;o numerous that they dur&s;t not venture to attack it.</P>
<P>After this expedition he returned to <HI>Imo&s;chi</HI> where he lived retired for nine years, and followed the traf|fick his family had e&s;tabli&s;hed, but when he wanted recreation he made a &s;port of hunting the Turks, and a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inating one or two from time to time.</P>
<P>One of the brothers of Socivizca following his ex|ample, became the terror of the country; he a&s;&s;ociated him&s;elf with a banditti, at the head of whom was one <HI>Pezeireb</HI> who took plea&s;ure in empaling alive all the Turks who had the misfortune to fall into his hands. This mon&s;ter of cruelty at la&s;t was taken by the Turks, who ran a &s;take thro his body, and then fa&s;tened him with cords to another, leaving him in this condition to expire at the &s;ide of a high road. Pa&s;&s;engers, and the pea&s;ants inhabiting the neighbourhood, affirmed, that he lived in this horrid &s;ituation three days, pre&s;erving his ferocity to the la&s;t, and &s;moaking repeated pipes given him by them as long as he had breath, notwih|&s;tanding the agonies he endured.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="032707_0008_0FF43295AAB5DA68">Soivcizca's brother, after the death of his chief, entered into a clo&s;e friend&s;hip with a Mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lachian, of the Greek church, but a &s;ubject of the Turks. This man was a <HI>Probatim,</HI> a name a&s;&s;umed by a fraternity in Morlachia, who by &s;olemn rites and ceremonies, at the foot of the alter, &s;wear an unalterable friend&s;hip to each other, and a mutual alliance offen&s;ive and defen|&s;ive. The u&s;ual vows had been exchanged between this Greek and Socivizca's brother, and in confirma|tion of their friend&s;hip, he invited him to pa&s;s a few days at his hou&s;e on the confines of Imo&s;chi: the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e having &s;hown him every mark of ho&s;pitality and atten|tion, when he had made him quite drunk, he advi&s;ed him to retire to re&s;t, and while he &s;lept, &s;ent for a par|ty of the Turks to whom, for a bribe, he delivered up his un&s;u&s;pecting gue&s;t. The Turks carried him to the Ba&s;haw of <HI>Trawnick,</HI> who knowing him to be the bro|ther of a man who had &s;worn de&s;truction to the Otto|man race held a council which la&s;ted eight hours, to devi&s;e the mo&s;t cruel mode of torturing him to death. The news of this dreadful cata&s;trophe &s;oon reached the ears of Socivizca, but as he remained ignorant of the circum&s;tances of his falling into their hands, he went directly to the hou&s;e of the <HI>Proba|tim</HI> for intelligence. The father of the prefidious friend, received him with the greate&s;t compo&s;ure, and being a venerable old man, Socivizca readily believed the artful tale he told him, of their being unexpectedly &s;urround|ed by the Turks, who had received &s;ome &s;ecret intelli|gence, no doubt, from an unknown hand. The Proba|tim
<PB N="10" REF="032707_0009_0FF42A3E684E7370">
likewi&s;e received him with &s;uch an appearance of real kindne&s;s, that he did not entertain the &s;malle&s;t &s;u&s;+picions of treachery: for he invited him to &s;tay the night, and told him he would fetch a fine lamb from the fold to make him an excellent &s;upper. With this pretence he left him, in affect, to run as fa&s;t as he could to give notice to a party of the Turki&s;h cavalry &s;tation|ed about twelve miles from his hou&s;e, that he had got their great enemy under his roof.</P>
<P>The hour of midnight was pa&s;&s;ed, when Socivizca finding the Probatim was not returned with the lamb, went to bed, as well as the re&s;t of the family, who &s;oon fell into a profound &s;leep, but as for Socivizca, his &s;u&s;|picions were awake, and he could not clo&s;e his eyes. "And &s;uch were my forebodings, &s;aid he, (his own words to the Emperor) as if I was at the brink of &s;ome eminent danger, that I jumped from my bed and en|deavoured to light a lamp by the a&s;hes of a fire that had been in the room, but the old man was in the plot with his &s;on, and knowing what they expected to happen in the cour&s;e of the night, had taken care to extingui&s;h ev|ery &s;park." He was then convinced that &s;ome horrid con&s;piracy was formed again&s;t his life, and rage took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his &s;oul; he &s;ought in vain for his arms, they were concealed: he then called aloud to know if any of the family could tell him where to find them, but no one replied, except an old woman, who bid the brute lie &s;till and not make a noi&s;e to di&s;turb the children. Fortunately he had a flint and a knife in his pocket, with which he &s;truck a light, and applied it to the lamp.
<PB N="11" REF="032707_0010_0FF432995E1C0DB8">
He then repaired to the old man's bed, and a&s;ked in a &s;evere tone of voice where they had put his arms, but the traitor to gain time, feigned to be a&s;leep, but being compelled to an&s;wer, he pretended not to under&s;tand him, which co&s;t him his life, for Socivizca took up a hatchet that lay by the chimney, and di&s;patched him. This &s;o terrified the woman, that &s;he in&s;tantly produc|ed his arms, and he had no &s;ooner got them, then he made his e&s;cape from the hou&s;e, and concealed him&s;elf in &s;ome thick bu&s;hes at a &s;mall di&s;tance to wait the e|vent. He had not been long in this &s;ituation before he heard the trampling of a great number of hor&s;es, and by the light of their torches he di&s;covered them to be a detachment of Turki&s;h cavalry, who di&s;mounted, went into the hou&s;e, and in a few minutes returned, &s;eem|ingly much di&s;appointed. Socivizca ob&s;erved their motions when they remounted and returned by the &s;ame road; at length, having narrowly watched that not one of them remained to lay wait for him, he ven|tured from his hiding place and made the be&s;t of his way to Imo&s;chi.</P>
<P>This double per&s;idy of the <HI>Probatim</HI> made &s;uch an impre&s;&s;ion upon his mind that it was never out of his thoughts, nor was he ea&s;y till he had taken a mo&s;t am|ple and cruel revenge. As &s;oon as he could get toge|ther &s;even companions on whom he could rely for their re&s;olution, in&s;en&s;ibility, and attachment, he pro|po&s;ed to them his horrid expedition, which was to &s;et fire to the hou&s;e in the dead of night. This they effect|ed &s;o &s;ecretly and &s;uddenly, that the cottage which was
<PB N="12" REF="032707_0011_0FF432484E4BA330">
built with wood and thatch was in flames before any of the family perceived it, except one woman, who endea|vouring to make her e&s;cape by the door, was &s;hot thro the head. Seventeen per&s;ons fell a victim to his &s;avage vengeance; and the Turks repre&s;ented this barbarous tran&s;action in &s;uch &s;trong terms, in a memorial again&s;t him, addre&s;&s;ed to the Governor General of Dalmatia, that he i&s;&s;ued a decree ordering the hou&s;e of Socivizca to be razed level with the ground, and &s;etting a price upon his head, by offering <HI>twenty &s;equins</HI> to any per&s;on who &s;hould kill him, and <HI>forty</HI> to tho&s;e who &s;hould take him alive. Before this decree appeared, he had with|drawn him&s;elf from Imo&s;chi, and &s;ecreted him&s;elf un|der different di&s;gui&s;es, in various places, without en|joying one hour of tranquility, from the con&s;tant exer|tion of his mind, to find means of avoiding a &s;urpri&s;e.</P>
<P>Being at the fair of Sign, in Augu&s;t 1754, the year in which he had burnt the family of the Probatim, he narrowly e&s;caped the pur&s;uit of a party of Croats, who were out in &s;earch of him, and therefore finding he was no longer &s;afe in any part of the Venetian territories&punc; he wrote privately to one of his confidential friends to &s;end his wife and family, with his effects, after him to <HI>Carlowitz,</HI> near the river <HI>Zermanga,</HI> as &s;oon as they could &s;ecurely quit the retreat in which they lay con|cealed. Thither he travelled on foot, with all po&s;&s;ible expedition, and not long after his family arrived with all his effects, which were con&s;iderable. His hou&s;ehold con&s;i&s;ted of him&s;elf, his two remaining brothers, his wife, a &s;on and two daughters. This place being &s;o &s;it|uated
<PB N="13" REF="032707_0012_0FF4329DA16D82A8">
that he had no opportunity to pur&s;ue his &s;avage vengeance again&s;t the Mahometans; his manners were in&s;en&s;ibly &s;oftened, he lived a peaceable life for three years, and might have been totally reformed if a certain per&s;on in authority in that country had not been tempted from motives of avarice to deliver him and his brothers into the hands of the Turks. It is &s;aid, he afterwards paid dear for his perfidy; but be this as it may, poor So|civizca and his two brothers were &s;ent to a fort beyond the <HI>Udbina,</HI> on the frontiers of the territories of Au&s;|tria, Venice, and Turkey, from whence they were e&s;|corted by a detachment of one hundred Turki&s;h hor&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to the Ba&s;haw of <HI>Traunick,</HI> the &s;ame who had put the fourth brother to death a few years before. After they had lain in pri&s;on &s;ome time, &s;inking under the weight of double irons, and &s;trictly guarded night and day: the alternative was propo&s;ed to them, either to turn Ma|hometans, or to be impaled. It may well be imagined they prefered the milder operation of circumci&s;ion; and at the &s;ame time it &s;hows the force of Turki&s;h &s;u|per&s;tition, which beats down the fence of ju&s;tice: for Socivizca was publickly known to be the mortal foe of their race; and had ma&s;&s;acred many of their brethren. Socivizca upon this occa&s;ion took the name of <HI>Ibrahim,</HI> but he did not thereby regain his liberty: his two broth|ers indeed were relea&s;ed, and one of them had the po&s;t of Aga be&s;towed upon him; but this did not prevent them from taking the fir&s;t fair opportunity to fly from the Turki&s;h dominions. The Ba&s;haw enraged at this &s;tep ordered the new Ibrahim to be more clo&s;ely con|fined; that the indulgence lately granted to him &s;hould
<PB N="14" REF="032707_0013_0FF4324C863A21A8">
be withdrawn, and notwith&s;tanding his pretended zeal for the Mahometan faith, that the guards &s;hould never lo&s;e &s;ight of him.</P>
<P>Perceiving at length, that all his religious adora|tions, his affected docility, and exemplary patience did not advance his deliverance; his fruitful imagination furni&s;hed him another &s;tratagem. His only relief from the horror of his fate was to conver&s;e with his guards, whom he one day addre&s;&s;ed in the following terms. "My condemnation to perpetual captivity I could bear with fortitude; I have been guilty of crimes which de|&s;erve this puni&s;hment; but I regret the quantity of money I have been obliged to bury under ground, while the hand of ju&s;tice pur&s;ued me from place to place: con&s;iderable &s;ums are likewi&s;e owing to me from my former neighbors and friends. The Ba&s;haw cannot de|mand the one, nor find the other, but if he would per|mit me to demand my dues in per&s;on, or to find the money I have concealed, it &s;hould be his; and I &s;hould be happy to regain his favor by the&s;e pre&s;ents, and to be re&s;tored to the privileges' I enjoyed before my bro|thers incurred his di&s;plea&s;ure by their e&s;cape."</P>
<P>The &s;ub&s;tance of this &s;peech was carried to the Ba|&s;haw; avarice, the ruling pa&s;&s;ion of the Turks, prevail|ed over every other con&s;ideration, and an order &s;oon came to the goaler, to perm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t <HI>Ibrahim</HI> to leave the pri&s;on, e&s;corted by ten of the guard<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, &amp; to give them directions to conduct him to every &s;pot where he &s;hould indicate that he had concealed any trea&s;ure.</P>
<P>Re&s;tored by this artful device to the liberty of
<PB N="15" REF="032707_0014_0FF432A14BD897C0">
breathing the free air, his &s;ubtlety furni&s;hed him with various pretences to amu&s;e the guards for upwards of a month; &s;ometimes he directed them to pur&s;ue one route to arrive at a cavern in which he had concealed a con|&s;iderable &s;um, at others, he declared he had mi&s;taken the place, and finally, at SIGN, being confronted by &s;everal per&s;ons whom he called his debtors to a large amount, but who &s;olemnly and juridically prote&s;ted they did not owe him a &s;ingle &s;equin, the guards to puni&s;h him loaded him with heavy irons and confined him in an ob&s;cure apartment, placing two &s;entinels at the door night and day, till they had repo&s;ed them&s;elves &s;ufficiently after the fatigue of travelling, and had pro|cured depo&s;itions in form of the fal&s;ity of his preten&s;ions to give to the Ba&s;haw. By way of revenge, they found means to &s;end for his wife and his two children, a boy and a girl, from the county of Zara, pretending that he was at full liberty, and had ordered them to repair to him, but as &s;oon as they arrived, they took them into cu&s;tody.</P>
<P>This was an unexpected aggravation of his misfor|tunes, but it did not conquer his fortitude, nor check the fertility of his genius, ever meditating the means of e&s;cape. On the 26th of November, 1758, Socivizca and his family were carried before the Effendi by his guards, in order to receive in&s;tructions for reconducting him to Traunick; his wife was ordered to ki&s;s the hand of the officer as a token of obedience; he &s;uffered her and his daughter to &s;ubmit to this ceremony, but when they ordered his &s;on to do the &s;ame&punc; he called to him in
<PB N="16" REF="032707_0015_0FF432502B3708B8">

<P>The inhabitants of Sign, affected at this melancholy cavalcade, in compa&s;&s;ion for his wife and children, made a collection for him, and the&s;e charitable contri|butions he turned to more advantage than a rich booty &s;o dexterous was he in re&s;ources.

About &s;un &s;et they arrived at the tower of Prologh, not far from Bilibrigh, where is a &s;tation of Turki&s;h cavalry.

The &s;now lay upon the ground, which at oth|er times is a fine valley lined with fruit trees. As &s;oon as the guard neare&s;t the hor&s;e mi&s;&s;ed his pri&s;oner, he imparted it to his companions, who were &s;tupified with a&s;toni&s;hment, and not &s;u&s;pecting that he had &s;top|ped, they &s;eperated and galloped on in pur&s;uit of him. Night now came on, and a heavy fall of &s;now, and when Socivizca thought it was &s;o dark that objects could not be any longer di&s;tingui&s;hed, he traver&s;ed the mountains and woods, continuing his journey all night to regain the Venetian frontiers. He was frequently obliged to climb up into trees to avoid the fury of wild bea&s;ts, but the weight of his chains generally brought him to the ground, and probably nothing but the rat|tling of them pre&s;erved him from being devoured.

length however he reached Morlachia in &s;afety; his countrymen relea&s;ed him from his chains, made great rejoicings upon the occa&s;ion, and compo&s;ed &s;ongs in their language to be &s;ung in honor of their hero.</P>
<P>He told the emperor, that at this period of his life he had re&s;olved to &s;upport him&s;elf and family by the la|bor of his hands in a private retreat, and not to commit any more depredations on the Turks; if he could have prevailed on the Ba&s;haw of Traunick to re&s;tore to him his wife and &s;on; as for his daughter &s;he had been com|pelled to embrace the Mahometan religion, and was well maried to a rich Turk, who &s;aid it was a pity &s;uch fine blood &s;hould be contaminated by a Morlachian con|tract. But the Ba&s;haw deaf to all his intreaties, and en|raged by di&s;appointment, would not an&s;wer the letters he wrote him, in which he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">emon&s;trated, that he had only followed the common law of nature in u&s;ing every &s;tratagem to recover that fir&s;t of ble&s;&s;ings, liberty. In|&s;tead of re&s;toring his wife and &s;on, he &s;ent an emba&s;&s;y to the Margrave Contarini, Govenor General of Vene|tian Dalmatia, requiring him by the law of nations to find him out, to &s;eize him, and to &s;end him to him. The Margrave who under&s;tood politicks better than the Ba|&s;haw, replied, that having once got him into their hands, within their own dominions, they &s;hould have taken care to prevent his e&s;cape; and that an attempt to make him compen&s;ate for their negligence was a manife&s;t af|front: in &s;hort, he di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the envoys with contempt.</P>
<P>As for Socivizca, finding all his endeavors to recov|er his wife and &s;on by fair means were fruitle&s;s, he re|&s;olved

to re&s;ume his former occupation and to avenge him&s;elf on the Ba&s;haw's &s;ubjects. For this purpo&s;e he put him&s;elf at the head of twenty five &s;elect compan|ions, all of them intrepid, and in the vigor of youth: with this cho&s;en band he took the road for Serraglio, the fir&s;t Turki&s;h town beyond the Venetian frontiers; for he had the prudence not to commit any act of vio|lence within the juri&s;diction of the Venetian &s;tate, that he might not make that government re&s;pon&s;ible for his depredations.</P>
<P>In a few days he met with a Turki&s;h caravan, con|&s;i&s;ting of one hundred hor&s;es laden with merchandi&s;e, and e&s;corted by &s;eventy men. The Turks &s;eeing him accompanied by &s;o &s;trong a band, though they were &s;o much &s;uperior, dreaded him to &s;uch a degree, that they fled with the utmo&s;t precipitation, and only one Jew merchant lo&s;t his life, in defence of his valuable effects. This audacious robbery alarmed the whole Ottoman empire. Parties were &s;ent out again&s;t him from all quar|ters, he was &s;ought for in the mountains and in the val|lies, every field and almo&s;t every bu&s;h was beat, as if they had been in cha&s;e of a wild boar; but this was all mockery to di&s;gui&s;e their cowardice, for while all the&s;e parties were making &s;uch &s;trict re&s;earches, he and his companions appeared at noon day in their villages, and &s;upplied them&s;elves with provi&s;ions in the markets of their towns. He generally lodged his booty at a con|vent of <HI>Caloyers,</HI> an order of friars of the Greek church, who make a vow of rigid ab&s;tinence, but who&s;e relig|ion does not prevent them from harboring the <HI>Aiduzee</HI> (highwaymen) of the country, and &s;haring their plunder.

The guardian of one of the&s;e convents &s;ituated at Drago|vich, &s;even miles beyond the &s;prings of Cettina, was his particular friend, and here he often retired, &s;epera|ting him&s;elf from his companions for many months, &s;o that the Turks often thought he was dead; while he was only waiting for an opportunity to fall upon them, and to exterminate as many of their race as po&s;&s;ible. At length, his robberies and ma&s;&s;acres became in&s;upporta|ble to the Ottomans, and occa&s;ioned great inconven|iences to the Venetian &s;tate; for they were the con|&s;tant &s;ource of quarrels between the inhabitants of the frontiers of the two powers, &s;o that it became the in|tere&s;t of the latter to &s;eize him; therefore upon every new complaint of the Turks, the government of Dal|matia increa&s;ed the reward offered to take him, dead or alive.</P>
<P>Socivizca was not in&s;en&s;ible of the great danger he was in of being &s;eized by open force, or betrayed by &s;ome fal&s;e friend for the &s;ake of the price &s;et on his head, yet &s;uch is the force of habit, that nothing could deter him from continuing his depredations on the Turks, In the cour&s;e of the year 1760, a certain Turk who&s;e name was <HI>Acia Smaich,</HI> a very formidable man in the opinion of his countrymen, and in his own ideas a great hero, boa&s;ted in all companies that Socivizca dur&s;t not encounter him in &s;ingle combat.

By their &s;pies they ea&s;ily got intelligence who was at the head of the e&s;cort, and Socivizca who was not of a temper to put up with the in&s;olence of Smaich, went out to meet the caravan; and as &s;oon as he approached it, pub|lickly called upon the Turk to defend him&s;elf. Smaich advancing, in&s;tantly fired from his carabine at Sociviz|ca, and aimed &s;o well that the ball &s;truck the upper part of his forehead, fortunately for him he had turned his head, to &s;ee that the enemy did not &s;urround him while he was engaged with his adver&s;ary, and in this po&s;ition, the ball pa&s;&s;ed obliquely and only gave him a &s;light wound; but it rendered him de&s;perate, and with amaz|ing rapidity he fired one ball which entered the barrel of Smaich's carabine, and a &s;econd which &s;hot him thro the head, and killed him on the &s;pot. His companions in&s;tantly fled, but five of them were overtaken in the pur&s;uit and put to death by Socivizca's comrades.</P>
<P>After they had plundered the caravan and divided the &s;poils, they di&s;gui&s;ed them&s;elves and took different roads, the better to avoid the re&s;earches of the Turks, who generally go in &s;earch of troops of robbers, and pay little or no attention to &s;ingle per&s;ons on the road. For &s;ome time after this event, Socivizca lived &s;o retir|ed and quiet, that it was generally believed he was dead; but when it was lea&s;t expected, he &s;uddenly ap|peared at the head of a formidable banditti, con&s;i&s;ting of twenty five &s;tout young men, with whom he march|ed to attack a very con&s;iderable caravan that was go|ing

At the fir&s;t on&s;et, they killed &s;eventeen of the Turks and took three pri&s;oners; which &s;o terrified the re&s;t of the guards, that they fled with the utmo&s;t precipitation and left him in quiet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the trea&s;ure. Socivizca was no &s;ooner arrived at a neighboring wood, than he ordered two of his pri&s;on|ers to be impaled alive, and a&s;&s;igned to the third, the dreadful office of turning the &s;take which was pa&s;&s;ed thro their bodies before a &s;low fire; his companions ad|vi&s;ed him to put the third to death, but in&s;tead of this when the two victims were half roa&s;ted, he ordered their heads to be cut off, which he delivered to the &s;urviv|ing pri&s;oner with this commi&s;&s;ion: "Carry the&s;e to the Ba&s;haw of <HI>Traunick,</HI> and tell him from me, that if he does not relea&s;e my wife and children without delay, I will &s;erve every Turk who falls into my hands in the &s;ame manner; and, that God only knows what exce&s;|&s;ive plea&s;ure it would give me to roa&s;t the Ba&s;haw him|&s;elf."</P>
<P>The melancholy amba&s;&s;ador no &s;ooner arrived at Traunick and made known the unhappy fate of his countrymen, than all the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nhabitants vowed revenge, and rivalled each other in their eagerne&s;s to arm and go in pur&s;uit of Socivizca. Several &s;trong parties of foot and hor&s;e took different routes to traver&s;e the mountains, woods, and vallies in &s;earch of this de&s;perate enemy. Upon this occa&s;ion they were &s;o exa&s;perated, that they re&s;olved to quit every other employment, and to think

of nothing el&s;e but the extirmination of Socivizca and his band; and they were very near &s;ucceeding, for not expecting &s;o much celerity on the part of the Turks, they were &s;urpri&s;ed in a wood, and obliged to maintain a flying &s;kirmi&s;h, in which five of his comrades were wounded and and one killed, who&s;e brother cut off his head, that the Turks might not have it to expo&s;e upon a gibbet: The Turks pur&s;ued them almo&s;t to <HI>Mitco<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ick</HI> in the <HI>Primorie,</HI> and in this place, belonging to the Vene|tians, they took refuge. E&s;caped from this eminent danger, Socivizca once more &s;eperated him&s;elf from his companions, and to avoid the con&s;equences of &s;uch a general pur&s;uit, he retired for &s;everal months and concealed him&s;elf in the mo&s;t di&s;mal caverns in the &s;ides of mountains, or in woods that were &s;eldom pen|etrated by any human foot-&s;tep; here he endured hun|ger, fatigue, and all the horrors of &s;olitude, venturing forth but &s;eldom for food, from the apprehen&s;ion of being traced to his retreats.</P>
<P>In the mean time the Ba&s;haw of Traunick was re|called to Con&s;tantinople, to an&s;wer to accu&s;ations of ty|ranny in his government, and a de&s;ign to pillage the province af <HI>Mo&s;tar:</HI> Socivizca had always foretold this event, and that whenever it happened, the fe&s;tivity and di&s;order which is occa&s;ioned by the arrival of a new Ba|&s;haw, would afford a favorable opportunity for his wife and children to e&s;cape. After a great many fruitle&s;s at|tempts to accompli&s;h this grand point, he fell upon a &s;tratagem which &s;ucceeded. A comrade who had found him out, and informed him of the revolution at Trau|nick,
<PB N="24" REF="032707_0023_0FF4325ED3EF4968">
agreed to be dre&s;&s;ed in the habit of the <HI>Calac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e,</HI> per&s;ons who have an exclu&s;ive privilege from the Grand Signor to &s;ell &s;ilks and other merchandi&s;e, in the nature of travelling pedlars, throughout all Turkey. Having collected four more of his troop, he &s;ent this man to Traunick, and with the others he arrived by another road within four miles of that city, and there waited the i&s;&s;ue of the enterpri&s;e. We know not how it hap|pened, but his four companions had one day left him alone, when three of the Turki&s;h cavalry acco&s;ted him, who &s;trongly &s;u&s;pected he was an <HI>Aiduco,</HI> but little imagined he was Socivizca. Finding no excu&s;e to evade this, he thought the only way of removing their &s;u&s;pi|cion was to offer to go with them to the city of <HI>Pru&s;ack,</HI> which was at no great di&s;tance; many people in that place knew him per&s;onally, and he would not have made this offer, if he had not imagined that their doubts concerning him would have cea&s;ed, and that they would have left him, for it was hardly po&s;&s;ible to conceive that any notorious robber would make &s;uch an offer.</P>
<P>Contrary to his expectations the Turks replied, Well then, we will, go with you: accordingly they &s;et out&punc; when they arrived on the banks of a river, the &s;oldie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> di&s;mounted to water their hor&s;es, Socivizca drew hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;abre unperceived, and in a moment &s;evered the hea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of one of them from his &s;houlders, the &s;econd turning round-upon his companion's falling at his feet, met with the &s;ame fate, &amp; the third, like a poor bird, who &s;ees th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> hawk ready to pounce upon him, was &s;truck motionle&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&punc; he had not the power to mount his hor&s;e, or to attemp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> his e&s;cape on foot: this man he, took a&s;ide into a

wood, and after he had drawn from him all the infor|mation he could procure concerning the number and di&s;po&s;ition of the troops that were in &s;earch of him, he &s;acrificed him al&s;o to the &s;avage re&s;entment he harbour|ed again&s;t all the Ottoman race. His four comrades found him employed in this dreadful manner, and with them he returned to the village wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e he was to wait for his emi&s;&s;ary to Traunick. The pretended pedlar, went about that city <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ending his &s;ilks for &s;ome days, till at la&s;t he met the wife of Socivizca, and imparted to her his &s;ecret de&s;ign. Overjoyed to find her hu&s;band was &s;o near, &s;he determined to join him if po&s;&s;ible, and &s;he would have brought off her daughter, but &s;he enjoyed &s;o much plea&s;ure in the arms of her hu&s;band, that &s;he would only con&s;ent to facilitate the e&s;cape of her mother and brother. In the du&s;k of the evening they followed the pedlar, as if they were bargaining for &s;ome of his goods, and walking gently out of the gates, as if intending to return, they &s;tole out without notice, and got clear off. The joy of Socivizca at their meeting, could only be re&s;trained by the &s;en&s;e of their immediate danger, and therefore as &s;oon as the fir&s;t embraces were over, he and his companions e&s;corted his wife and his &s;on to <HI>Draco|vick,</HI> the u&s;ual place of refuge for them, and he de&s;ired the Cal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">yer, his confidential friend to teach the boy to read and write.</P>
<P>When it was known in Traunick that the wife and &s;on of Socivizca were not to be found, after the &s;tric|te&s;t &s;earch, the inhabitants were in as much con&s;terna|tion as if their city had been be&s;ieged: fear was on ev|ery
<PB N="26" REF="032707_0025_0FF432655C3F79D0">
countenance, for the name of Socivizca was become &s;o formidable to the Turks, that in&s;tead of terrifying their children with the appearance of gho&s;ts; they had only to name Socivizca to make them &s;hudder, and as the &s;um of all puni&s;hment; not doubting that he him&s;elf had conducted this bold enterpri&s;e; they intreat|ed the new Ba&s;haw to make the &s;tronge&s;t remon|&s;trances to the governor of Dalmatia, declaring that they could not &s;leep in tranquillity, unle&s;s his excel|lency would cau&s;e him to be &s;eized and put to death.

<P>About the latter end of the year 1764, Socivizca found him&s;elf deprived of mo&s;t of his comrades, &s;ome being carried off by the plague which raged with great violence in the territory of <HI>Sign,</HI> and others, among&s;t whom were the mo&s;t de&s;perate, being taken and execu|ted for robberies in the Venetian dominions. Thus circum&s;tanced, he could not undertake any co&s;iderable enterpri&s;e, for which rea&s;on he retired to the Au&s;trian frontiers near the river <HI>Zermagna,</HI> and his name was not heard of again for &s;ome years, in&s;omuch that the Turks had entirely forgot him, imagining he was either dead, or had taken refuge in &s;ome very remote part of the world. However, he was not quite idle all this time, for under the name and di&s;gui&s;e of a chief
<PB N="27" REF="032707_0026_0FF432B7BB137578">
of another banditti who died, he a&s;&s;i&s;ted in &s;ome attacks on &s;mall caravans, and collected a little booty, ju&s;t &s;ufficient for the &s;upport of his own family. But in the year 1769, he appeared publicly again; having picked up eight a&s;&s;ociates of determined valour, they attacked and pillaged larger caravans with &s;ucce&s;s, and once more &s;pread an alarm throughout the Turki&s;h ter|ritories. Innumerable and almo&s;t incredible &s;tories are related of his intrepidity and dexterity about this time, in his encounters with large bodies of the Turki&s;h hor&s;e &s;ent out to &s;cower the country in &s;earch of him. At one time, perceiving a party of twenty five, ap|proaching, he ordered his comrades to conceal them|&s;elves behind &s;ome trees, and to place their caps in &s;uch a manner in others near, that they &s;hould appear to be upon the heads of men; by this &s;tratagem he doubled the number of his little corps, and confounded the ene|my, for having fired at the caps which all fell down, and yet &s;till receiving a warm di&s;charge of &s;hot from another quarter, they thought there was &s;ome magic in it, and were &s;truck with &s;uch a panic that they fled with the utmo&s;t precipitation. Another party con&s;i&s;t|ing of forty, coming upon him by &s;urpri&s;e in a wood near the banks of a river, his companions had ju&s;t time to e&s;cape by flight, and while the Turks were pointing their mu&s;quetry at them, he darted into the river and lay concealed under the water, in the hollow of a bank. The a&s;toni&s;hed Turks thought it impo&s;&s;i|ble he could e&s;cape them, and at la&s;t fatigued with fruitle&s;s &s;earch, they gave him to the devil with whom

they were certain he was in league, otherwi&s;e he could not have rendered him&s;elf almo&s;t in&s;tantaneou&s;ly invi&s;|ible.</P>
<P>At length he began to grow tired of the wretched kind of life he led, and re&s;olved to employ the money he had &s;aved in purcha&s;ing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ome little po&s;t for the re|mainder of his days; but his de&s;ign was fru&s;trated by a cruel misfortune. The Caloyer, his confe&s;&s;or, with whom he had depo&s;ited five hundred &s;equins and &s;ome valuable jewels, the principal fruit of his robberies, ran away with them and was never heard of more; and to complete his mi&s;ery, while he was gone as far as the Danube in pur&s;uit of him on fal&s;e intelligence, one of his cou&s;ins from Imo&s;chi came to pay him a vi&s;it, and availing him&s;elf of his ab&s;ence, &s;tripped the hou&s;e of his clothes and linen. The&s;e events happened in the beginning of the year 1775, and the bitter complaints he made of the perfidy of the&s;e two thieves, &s;howed that he was abandoning him&s;elf to di&s;pair, when by one of tho&s;e unaccountable vici&s;&s;itudes for which the lives of &s;ome men are remarkable, chance brought the pre|&s;ent emperor of Germany to the village where he re&s;id|ed; it lay in the route of his memorable travels under&punc; the title of Count Falker&s;tein; and the fame, &s;uch as it was, of this bold man having reached Vienna many years before, his maje&s;ty &s;ent for him, that he might be entertained with his adventures from his own mouth.

<P>WHEN a lady happens to feel tender pre|po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, in favor of a man very much inferior to her in point of rank and fortune, &s;he may be allowed to make the fir&s;t overtures to him, e&s;pecially if &s;he had rea&s;on to believe, from his behavior, that he feels pre|po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of the &s;ame kind with her own, and that he is only prevented by a delicate con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of his inferiority, from making an avowal of his pa&s;&s;ion for her. In this &s;ituation, however, tho appearances may be very promi&s;ing, a woman cannot be &s;ure of di&s;inter|e&s;tedne&s;s on the &s;ide of him who has made an impre&s;|&s;ion on her heart; &s;he cannot be certain that his affec|tion
<PB N="30" REF="032707_0029_0FF4326B2D9747A8">
is pure and unmixed with any mercenary con&s;id|erations, without making &s;ome trial of it; without bringing it to the te&s;t. An artful woman is not, in general, an amiable character; but, in the&s;e &s;uppo&s;ed circum&s;tances, no woman can be fairly blamed for the exertion of her addre&s;s.</P>
<P>Olivetta, a rich heire&s;s in one of the mo&s;t fertile parts of Spain, lived upon the lands &s;he inherited in a &s;tyle which at once proved the grandeur of her &s;enti|ments, and the delicacy of her ta&s;te; the &s;trength of her under&s;tanding, and the goodne&s;s of her heart. In the various arrangements of her hou&s;ehold, &s;he di&s;covered a con&s;iderable deal of judgment, happily &s;teering be|tween the two extremes of par&s;imony and extrava|gance: and, while &s;he exhibited a &s;plendid appearance to the world, had not recour&s;e to any dome&s;tic mean|ne&s;&s;es for the &s;upport of it. Her liberality was exten|&s;ive; but it was ever under the guidance of di&s;cretion: the objects of her beneficence were numerous; but they were objects de&s;erving of her compa&s;&s;ion, before they ta&s;ted of her genero&s;ity.</P>
<P>It may be ea&s;ily imagined that &s;uch a woman, unmar|ried, had a train of admirers. Olivetta's admirers were innumerable, and many of them were in a &s;ituation to ju&s;tify their pretentions to an alliance with her; but, as &s;he had di&s;cernment enough to &s;ee that the majority of them only wanted to increa&s;e their con&s;equence by the addition of her fortune, &s;he very prudently declin|ed coming to any &s;erious conver&s;ation with them.</P>
<P>Among tho&s;e who wi&s;hed to be united to Olivetta,
<PB N="31" REF="032707_0030_0FF432BE217692F8">
there was one, however, whom &s;he particularly di&s;tin|gui&s;hed from the re&s;t, and whom &s;he felt emotions, of which &s;he had not, before he came in her way, been &s;en&s;ible. With nothing to recommend him&s;elf to her fir&s;t notice but an agreeable per&s;on, and a genteel de|portment, he drew her attention: by his mode&s;t and re&s;pectful behavior afterwards he became of &s;o much importance in her eyes, that &s;he could not help &s;ecretly wi&s;hing he was in a &s;ituation to throw him&s;elf into the line of her opulent lovers; a line which he avoided with a decency which heightened the favora|ble opinion &s;he had entertained of him.</P>
<P>Julio, the timid, &s;ilent, &s;incere lover of Olivetta, was by birth a gentleman, but the &s;port of fortune. His parents, having met with a &s;eries of bitter di&s;ap|pointments &s;unk at la&s;t under the oppre&s;&s;ive load of them, and left him to &s;truggle with an income ju&s;t &s;uffi|cient for a decent &s;ub&s;i&s;tance: an income by no means equal to what he had rea&s;on to expect in his early days, to the education which his father be&s;towed upon him when he was in a flouri&s;hing &s;tate, and had no pre&s;enti|ment of the change he was de&s;tined to feel in his cir|cum&s;tances. With that income, however, he made him&s;elf, by dint of oeconomy, fit to mix with the be&s;t company. His figure, his conver&s;ation, and his man|ners, were extremely engaging, and he was as much prai&s;ed as pitied by all who new him. Every body &s;aid, that he de&s;erved to be placed in a very different &s;phere, but nobody offered to promote his advancement to it. A man cramped in his affairs by the mere ca|price
<PB N="32" REF="032707_0031_0FF42A085ECFD910">
of fortune, without having done any thing to me|rit his adver&s;ity, may derive &s;ome plea&s;ure, indeed, from the good wi&s;hes of his friends; but if tho&s;e who declare them&s;elves to be his friends are not active in his &s;ervice, if they take no &s;teps to remove the di&s;tre&s;&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> which excite their compa&s;&s;ion, he is under very &s;light obligations to them. Julio could not but be pained by the inactivity of his friends, yet he was cheerful; and moved in his &s;mall circle uncomplaining, unrepining with a dignity which threw a lu&s;tre upon his character, and &s;hamed many illu&s;trious per&s;onages who looked down upon him with the cold eye of commi&s;eration.</P>
<P>This was the man whom Olivetta beheld in the mo&s;t favorable light, and whom &s;he thought worthy of that affluence which &s;he her&s;elf enjoyed. At fir&s;t &s;he viewed him with a kind of reverence, &s;o much was &s;he &s;truck with the philo&s;ophic part of his character: Venera|tion was &s;oon followed by e&s;teem, &amp; e&s;teem in a &s;hort time ripened into love. Such was the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of feelings in Olivetta's bo&s;om, and the la&s;t gave no &s;mall di&s;tur|bance to her gentle brea&s;t. Many were the tender lines which &s;he remembered from the &s;oft pages of the mo&s;t elegant Spani&s;h poets, lines of which &s;he had not till then felt the full&mdash;the more than poetic force. She blu&s;hed whenever &s;he thought of her loving a man in a &s;tation &s;o much beneath her. Not becau&s;e &s;he deem|ed Julio unde&s;erving of her &s;incere&s;t affection, but be|cau&s;e &s;he clearly perceived that he would not venture to offer him&s;elf to her for a hu&s;band, and that &s;he could not of cour&s;e hope to be united to him in the manner
<PB N="33" REF="032707_0032_0FF432C1C2F5FEE0">
&s;he wi&s;hed, without deviating from the decorum which &s;he could not bring her&s;elf to violate.</P>
<P>While &s;he was &s;itting one day in this painful, per|plexing &s;ituation, in a pen&s;ive attitude, over one of her favorite poets, a young lady, for whom &s;he had a great regard, who lived with her as a companion, endeavored to divert her melancholy, by &s;ome &s;prightly reflections on the havock made between the two &s;exes by the belle pa&s;&s;ion: but poor Olivetta was too much under the in|fluence of that pa&s;&s;ion to be amu&s;ed with her compan|ion's vivacity. She only, &s;ighing, replied, that tho&s;e were, in her opinion, the unhappie&s;t of human beings, who were denied the &s;atisfaction of a marriage agreea|ble to their inclinations.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">Franci&s;ca, who knew as well what pa&s;&s;ed in Olivet|ta's heart at that moment as &s;he did her&s;elf, told her, that, "if &s;he was in her place, &s;he would marry the man &s;he liked, however inferior he might be to her, if he was not unworthy of her, if &s;he could be a&s;&s;ured of his loving her, without any lucrative views in re|turn."</P>
<P>"Would you have me conde&s;cend to make the fir&s;t advances to a man?"</P>
<P>"The fir&s;t advances from a woman to a man, replied Franci&s;ca, are not, I confe&s;s, in general, to be defended; but, circum&s;tanced as you are, a few female delicacies may, I think, be di&s;pen&s;ed with. You love Julio&mdash;nay, you need not be a&s;hamed of loving him&mdash;I am &s;ure he is nece&s;&s;ary to your happine&s;s. He is very much your inferior, I grant, with re&s;pect to rank and for|tune,
<PB N="34" REF="032707_0033_0FF43270FA22E388">
but he is a gentleman by birth and education, and intrin&s;ically &s;uperior to all his richer competitors. From the mode&s;ty of his behavior, in con&s;equence, no doubt, of his elevated &s;entiments, I will pre&s;ume to &s;ay, that he will never &s;peak fir&s;t upon the &s;ubject."</P>
<P>"Then I am doomed to be mi&s;erable," exclaimed Olivetta, ha&s;tily interrupting her, ri&s;ing, and walking acro&s;s her chamber inexpre&s;&s;ibly agitated.</P>
<P>"Perhaps not, an&s;wered Franci&s;ca, your amiable lover, thro his extreme diffidence, a diffidence which enhances his merit, prevents him from di&s;clo&s;ing the &s;en&s;ations which wound his peace on your account, may be drawn into the very declaration you wi&s;h to extract from him, I do not pretend to put my&s;elf upon a foot|ing with you in any &s;hape; yet I fancy, I can point out a way to you, by which you may arrive at the &s;ummit of your de&s;ires, without being reduced to any indelicate mea&s;ures."</P>
<P>Olivetta, after having li&s;tened very attentively to her concluding words, earne&s;tly entreated her to pro|ceed with the greate&s;t freedom and unre&s;ervedne&s;s.</P>
<P>Franci&s;ca obeyed, proceeded, and gave Olivetta &s;o much plea&s;ure by her communications, that &s;he re&s;olved to avail her&s;elf of her advi&s;e without delay.</P>
<P>While Olivetta and Franci&s;ca were engaged in this manner, Julio, unable to remain in a place where he was perpetually beholding the woman whom he loved to di&s;traction, but with whom he dared not to expect an alliance, determined to remove him&s;elf to a di&s;tant part of the country, and endeavor, by ab&s;ence, to cure the
<PB N="35" REF="032707_0034_0FF42A48D58D1700">
wounds which love had inflicted on his heart. It was not, however, till after the &s;evere&s;t conflict which he had ever endured, that he re&s;olved to take a &s;tep &s;o lit|tle likely to produce the intended effect.</P>
<P>When he had packed up the few moveables in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, he repaired to Olivetta's magnificent man|&s;ion, in order to pay his grateful acknowledgements for all the civilities he had received from her, and to bid his eyes "take their la&s;t farewell."</P>
<P>The reception which he met with from the "god|de&s;s of his idolatay," would have probably encouraged any other man to tell his "fond tale;" but he, from the extreme refinement of his ideas, was &s;ilent upon the &s;ub|ject in which he was mo&s;t intere&s;ted, and only announ|ced his departure, after having poured out his mo&s;t grateful effu&s;ions. During the delivery of tho&s;e effu&s;ions, O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">vetta's cheeks were alternately pale and red, and the concluding words affected her in &s;uch a manner, that &s;he was almo&s;t on the point of fainting away. Recover|ing her&s;elf, however, in a few moments, &s;he took a dia|mond ring, of con&s;iderable value, from her finger, and pre&s;ented it to him, with the following &s;peech.</P>
<P>"Having longer entertained a high opinion of your merit, &s;ir, I have long wi&s;hed to reward it; and if I &s;hould happily have it in my power to be of &s;ervice to you, I &s;hall certainly prove my&s;elf your friend. In the mean time, I beg you to accept this trifle (pre&s;enting the ring to him) as a &s;mall token of my regard; and let me be acquainted with your route, if you are ab&s;o|lutely determined to leave this place, that I may know
<PB N="36" REF="032707_0035_0FF432754F156B70">
whither to di&s;patch a me&s;&s;enger, &s;hould I hear of any thing to your advantage."</P>
<P>If Julio had ob&s;erved Olivetta's looks, while &s;he delivered the above &s;peech, with the penetrating eyes of a truly touched inamorato, he would have derived the highe&s;t &s;atisfaction from them, as they forcibly a&s;|&s;ured him, as forcible as a thou&s;and words could have done&punc; that &s;he earne&s;tly wi&s;hed to reward him per&s;on|ally for the merit which had won her heart, and that &s;he wi&s;hed, with the utmo&s;t impatience, for his making the fir&s;t overtures, to &s;ave her from the indelicacy of having recour&s;e to a &s;till plainer mode of utterance for the con&s;umation of her de&s;ires: her cha&s;te de&s;ires: for &s;he loved Julio with an affection of the pure&s;t kind; loved him more for his internal worth than for his ex|ternal accompli&s;hments.</P>
<P>Julio, overwhelmed at once with gratitude, love, and delicacy, was unable to return an an&s;wer to the mo&s;t friendly expre&s;&s;ions with which the brilliant dona|tion was accompanied.</P>
<P>It is an old &s;aying, and a pretty true one, that a man &s;incerely in love is very apt to look like a fool in the pre&s;ence of his mi&s;tre&s;s. It is not quite clear that Julio's appearance would have been &s;illy before a wom|an to whom he might have had, as he thought, preten|tions, without being guilty of impertinence or pre|&s;umption; but Olivetta's &s;uperiority operated upon him in &s;uch a manner, that all the encouragement &s;he gave him to di&s;clo&s;e his tender &s;en&s;ations, was in&s;uffi|ficient to remove the ob&s;tructions which delicacy threw
<PB N="37" REF="032707_0036_0FF42BB442B2E718">
in his way. After much he&s;itation, and many &s;trong marks of irre&s;olution in his whole behavior, he murmured out &s;omething very grateful, but very aukwardly pro|nounced, and retired.</P>
<P>It is not ea&s;y to de&s;cribe what Olivetta &s;uffered, when her timid lover had taken his leave. Ordering her attendant to withdraw, &s;he thus unbo&s;omed her&s;elf to her faithful companion,</P>
<P>"The behavior of this amiable man, my dear Fran|ci&s;ca, is not to be endured. I have gone as far as I can with propriety, to make him &s;ee that his addre&s;&s;es to me would be favorably received; but to no purpo&s;e. You are continually a&s;&s;uring me, that he loves me as much as I love him. Would he not then, encouraged as he has been, make a declaration? Be&s;ides, how can you reconcile his intended departure from this place for ever&mdash;the&s;e were his words, Franci&s;ca, with the vi|olence of his attachment to me?"</P>
<P>"The violence of his attachment, replied Franci&s;ca &s;miling, is the cau&s;e of his departure. If he was quite indifferent about you, he would not, I imagine, have thought of it. His diffidence, his delicacy&mdash;call it what you will, prevents him from revealing the &s;ecret he longs to di&s;cover, (you cannot your&s;elf long more to have the di&s;clo&s;ure of it;)&mdash;and he is therefore re&s;olved to fly from a &s;pot which is become &s;o di&s;tre&s;&s;ing to him."</P>
<P>"You are right, I believe, my dear; but what can I do? how can I act? I cannot &s;ay directly to him, "I love!" and he will not, you perceive, give me a decent opportunity to tell him &s;o."</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="032707_0037_0FF43279122F78C8">"You are two of the mo&s;t refined lovers in Spain; but, were I in your &s;ituation, I would&mdash;</P>
<P>Here Franci&s;ca was interrupted by the arrival of a letter to Olivetta, who, upon breaking it open and &s;ee|ing the name of Julio at the bottom of the page, read it with her &s;pirits more fluttered than &s;he had before ever felt them.</P>
<P>"The unfortunate Julio, unable to expre&s;s his grat|titude in the terms he wi&s;hed, when he received the generous Olivetta's valuable pre&s;ent accompanied with a&s;&s;urances of a very flattering kind, cannot help embracing this opportunity, before his departure, to in|form her, that her noble behavior has &s;trengthened his re&s;olution never to return. The recollection of her promi&s;ed friend&s;hip will afford him, wherever he goes, as much con&s;olation as he can po&s;&s;ibly enjoy, while he feels him&s;elf in a &s;ituation which forbids him to expect an alliance with the only woman in the world whom he can ever love. From the pre&s;ence of her, he flies into a voluntary exile, becau&s;e he cannot bear the &s;ight of that beauty for which he ardently long<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, but dares not hope to call his own. May &s;he never endure the pangs of love, &s;harpened by de&s;pair."</P>
<P>The peru&s;al of this letter occa&s;ioned a variety of mixed emotions in the fluttered bo&s;om of Olivetta, but the plea&s;ing ones were predominant. Suppo&s;ing that &s;he might now venture to reward the merit which had long engro&s;&s;ed her attention, &s;he di&s;patched a note to her de&s;pairing l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ver, &s;ufficiently animating, &s;he imagin|ed,
<PB N="39" REF="032707_0038_0FF432C7822F3C10">
not only to make him give up all thoughts of ban|i&s;hment, but to bring him in ha&s;te to her pre&s;ence.</P>
<P>Having &s;ent it away by a tru&s;ty and active me&s;&s;enger, &s;he waited for his coming back with a re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s much more ea&s;ily to be conceived than communicated.</P>
<P>The me&s;&s;enger, hearing that Julio had &s;et out from his appartment &s;ome hours before his arrival, made all the enquiries in his power concerning the road he had taken; but, not being able to gain the lea&s;t intelligence about it, returned with his di&s;patches.</P>
<P>Olivetta, on the return of her dome&s;tic, was inex|pre&s;&s;ibly di&s;appointed, di&s;contented, and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed; and while &s;he regretted the lo&s;s of the only man who had kindled the flame of love, in her brea&s;t, reproached her|&s;elf &s;everely for that refinement which, by driving him into exile, had deprived her of the exqui&s;ite plea&s;ure &s;he had promi&s;ed her&s;elf from the contents of her an&s;wer to his de&s;ponding epi&s;tle.</P>
<P>Day &s;ucceeded day, week followed week, moons per|formed their revolutions, and no Julio appeared. At la&s;t, her pain on his account increa&s;ing, and her patience being quite exhau&s;ted, Olivetta, dead to all enjoyments of the world, re&s;olved to &s;eclude her&s;elf from it; to &s;pend the remainder of her melancholy days in a con|vent. Having made over the greate&s;t part of her for|tune to Franci&s;ca, &s;he proceeded to carry her mona&s;ti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> de&s;igns into execution.</P>
<P>When &s;he arrived within &s;ight of her retreat, the very man for who&s;e &s;ake &s;he was going to bury her&s;elf alive, Julio, &s;urpri&s;ed her with his appearance. The
<PB N="40" REF="032707_0039_0FF4327E0BD2EAA0">
moment he &s;aw her, he advanced with an uncommon agility towards her; perceiving on a nearer approach, that &s;he looked like the picture of death, he &s;tarted, and could hardly believe his eyes.</P>
<P>Olivetta, while her lover was advancing to her, had fainted away in the arms of her attendants. As &s;oon as &s;he recovered, he inquired with the greate&s;t anxiety into the cau&s;e of the melancholy alteration in her looks. On her acquainting him with her &s;ufferings on his ac|count, and with her conventual intentions, in con&s;e|quence of them, he rapturou&s;ly told her that it was in his power, by the decea&s;e of an opulent relation, to rein&s;tate her in her former &s;tile of life; and that, if &s;he would con&s;ent to &s;hare his unexpected acqui&s;ition with him, he &s;hould deem him&s;elf the happie&s;t being in the uni|ver&s;e.</P>
<P>Olivetta was charmed with a behavior which left her no room to que&s;tion the &s;incerity of her Julio's at|tachment to her; but threw out a few difficulties, origi|na<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing from a new &s;pecies of delicacy. The&s;e difficul|ties were, however, &s;oon &s;urmounted, and the union of their hearts was cemented by the union of their hands.</P>

<HEAD>STORY OF <HI>ARISTOCLEA</HI> FROM <HI>PLUTARCH.</HI></HEAD>
<P>ARISTOCLEA, the daughter of Theophanes was celebrated all over Greece for her virtues, her beauty, and her accompli&s;hments. Merit, &s;o con&s;picu|ous as hers, could not but attract the regard of the Gre|cian

youth, ever &s;u&s;ceptible of the fine&s;t emotions of love. Among the re&s;t of her admirers, Strato and Cal|li&s;thenes were &s;o happy as to obtain peculiar marks of di&s;tinction.</P>
<P>Strato had all the recommendations which wealth and power can be&s;tow, &amp; to do him ju&s;ti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e, was not en|tirely de&s;titute of per&s;onal merit. The only objection, which could with the appearance of rea&s;on be made to him, was, that he was con&s;iderably advanced beyond that period which is called the flower of youth; an ob|jection which commonly has great weight in a female heart.</P>
<P>Calli&s;thenes yielded to Strato in fortune, intere&s;t, and family: but his per&s;on was more engaging, his man|ners more polite, and his acquirements more agreeable. There was a peculiar mode&s;ty in his addre&s;s, which probably might be encrea&s;ed by a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of the &s;mallne&s;s of his fortune: but this circum&s;tance tended to promote his intere&s;t; for however it depre&s;&s;ed his &s;pirit, it taught him that &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive &s;oftne&s;s, which makes him appear amiable in the eyes of Ari&s;toclea.</P>
<P>Strato, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, was the more ardent lover, and his pa&s;&s;ion had been enflamed by an acciden|tal &s;ight of his fair charmer while &s;he was bathing, one &s;ummer morning, in a little rivulet that glided thro her father's garden.</P>
<P>Calli&s;thenes, perhaps in reality, felt as &s;trong a pa&s;|&s;ion as his rival, yet was he le&s;s a&s;&s;iduous in his addre&s;&s;|es, from de&s;pair of &s;ucceeding again&s;t a competitor &s;o much his &s;uperior in rank and fortune.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="032707_0041_0FF42A13EE852248">Theophanes, the father of Ari&s;toclea, was much embarra&s;&s;ed by the importunities of the two lovers, but would gladly have given his con&s;ent to him who&s;e po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ions were the large&s;t, had he not been cautious of interfering in the choice of his daughter. After many delays, it was at la&s;t agreed, on all &s;ides, to refer the af|fair to a neighbor of great wi&s;dom and experience, by who&s;e deci&s;ion it was re&s;olved to abide.</P>
<P>In the mean time, Strato was informed by a confi|dent of Ari&s;toclea, whom he had bribed with liberal pre&s;ents, that he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the fir&s;t place in the affec|tions of his mi&s;tre&s;s. Animated with this intelligence, he determined to break off the agreement of referring the affair to a &s;tranger, and to leave it to be decided by the mo&s;t proper judge, Ari&s;toclea her&s;elf. Calli&s;the|nes readily acceded to the propo&s;al, from a conviction, that if he &s;tood any chance; it could be only from the deci&s;ion of the fair object of his love. The father, who had previou&s;ly been a&s;&s;ured by Strato, that his daughter had &s;hown him a preference, entered without he&s;itation into the agreement, and appointed an early day for the final determination.</P>
<P>During this unea&s;y interval, various were the emo|tions of the two lovers. Strato already anticipated his happine&s;s, and wantoned in imagination on all the charms of his mi&s;tre&s;s. Calli&s;thenes, on the contrary felt all the pain and angui&s;h of &s;u&s;pended hope.</P>
<P>At length, the important hour arrived. Strato ap|proached to hear his doom with a &s;mile of confidence; Calli&s;thenes in all the dejection of de&s;pair. How &s;ud|denly
<PB N="43" REF="032707_0042_0FF432CE07C06000">
were their &s;everal emotions exchanged, when the lovely fair one declared in favor of the de&s;ponding Calli&s;thenes! Strato, however, after many efforts, got the better of his amazement and chagrin, a&s;&s;umed an air of chearfulne&s;s, and be&s;ought the happy pair to grant him one reque&s;t, which was to permit him to be pre&s;ent at the nuptial ceremony.

<HEAD><HI>OMAR,</HI> OR THE FOLLY OF ENVY. AN EAST|ERN TALE.</HEAD>
<P>AS Omar of Ba&s;ra was one day wandering along the &s;treets of Bagdat, mu&s;ing on the varieties of merchandi&s;e which the &s;hops offered to his view, and ob&s;erving the different occupations which bu&s;ied the multitudes on every &s;ide, he was awakened from the tranquility of meditation, by a croud that ob&s;tructed the pa&s;&s;age. He rai&s;ed his eyes and &s;aw the chief Vi&s;ier, who had returned from the Divan, and was entering his palace.</P>
<P>Omar mingled with the attendants, and being &s;up|po&s;ed to have &s;ome petition for the Vi&s;ier, was permitted to enter. He &s;urveyed the &s;paciou&s;ne&s;s of the apart|ments, admired the walls hung with golden tape&s;try, and the floors covered with &s;ilken carpets, and de&s;pi&s;ed the &s;imple neatne&s;s of his own little habitation. Surely, &s;aid he to him&s;elf, this palace is the &s;eat of happine&s;s, where plea&s;ure &s;ucceeds to plea&s;ure, and di&s;content and &s;orrow can have no admi&s;&s;ion. Whatever nature has provided for the delight of &s;en&s;e, is here &s;pread forth to be enjoy|ed. What can mortal wi&s;h or imagine which the ma&s;|ter of this palace has not obtained? The di&s;hes of lux|ury cover his table, the voice of harmony lulls him in his bowers; he breathes the fragrance of the groves of Java, and &s;leeps upon the downs of the cygnets of the Gange<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.

<P>How different, Omar, is thy condition, who art doomed to the perpetual torments of un&s;atisfied de&s;ire, and who has no amu&s;ement in thy power that can withold thee from thy own conviction. They tell thee that thou art wi&s;e, but what does wi&s;dom avail with poverty? None will flatter the poor, and the wi&s;e have very little power of flattering them&s;elves. That man, is &s;urely the mo&s;t wretched of the &s;ons of wretch|edne&s;s, who lives with his own faults and follies always before him, and who has none to reconcile him to him|&s;elf by prai&s;e and veneration. I have long &s;ought con|tent, and have not found it; I will from this moment endeavor to be rich.</P>
<P>Full of his new re&s;olution, he &s;huts him&s;elf in his chamber for &s;ix months, to deliberate how he &s;hould grow rich; he &s;ometimes propo&s;es to offer him&s;elf as a coun&s;ellor to one of the kings of India, and &s;ometimes re&s;olves to dig for diamonds in the mines of Colconda. One day, after &s;ome hours pa&s;&s;ed in violent fluctuation of opinion, &s;leep in&s;en&s;ibly &s;eized him in his chair.

Omar looked, &amp; e&s;pied a little well out of which i&s;&s;ued a &s;mall rivulet. Tell me now, &s;aid his father, do&s;t thou wi&s;h for &s;udden affluence, that may pour upon thee like the mountain torrent, or for a &s;low and gradual increa&s;e, re&s;embling the rill gliding from the well?

Look round thee, &s;aid his father; once again Omar looked, and &s;aw the channnel of the torrent dry and du&s;ty. But, following the rivulet from the well, he traced it to a wide lake, which the &s;upply, &s;low and con&s;tant, kept always full. He waked, and determined to grow rich by &s;ilent profits and per&s;evering indu&s;try.</P>
<P>Having &s;old his patrimony, he engaged in merchan|dize, and in twenty years purcha&s;ed lands on which he rai&s;ed a hou&s;e, equal in &s;umptuou&s;ne&s;s to that of the Vi&s;ier's, to which he invited all the mini&s;ters of plea&s;|ure, expecting to enjoy all the felicity he had imagined riches able to afford. Lei&s;ure &s;oon made him weary of him&s;elf, and he longed to be per&s;uaded that he was great and happy. He was courteous and liberal, he gave all that approached him hopes of plea&s;ing him, &amp; all who &s;hould plea&s;e him hopes of being rewarded. Ev|ery act of prai&s;e was tried, and every &s;ource of adula|tory fiction was exhau&s;ted. Omar heard his flatteries without delight, becau&s;e he found him&s;elf unable to be|lieve them.

<HEAD><HI>EDWIN</HI> AND <HI>ADELA.</HI> A TRAGIC STORY.</HEAD>
<P>ADELA was the only daughter of a powerful baron of Aquitaine. Her father &s;prung from an illu&s;|trious family, and added to hereditary honors, the glory of heroic atchievements. In his youth, he accompan|ied the flower of the European chivalry, who fought under the banner of Godfrey, and recovered the holy &s;epulchre from the hands of the infidel. He returned to his country, crowned with victory, and fair renown; and inherited the rich domains of his ance&s;tors. Adela was in the prime of beauty, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a &s;u&s;ceptible heart. In her air and a&s;pect, dignity was mingled with &s;weetne&s;s: for in the di&s;po&s;ition of her mind, con&s;cious elevation of &s;entiment was &s;oftened by amiable and mild affections.</P>
<P>Edwin, a gallant youth, animated with the gener|ous love of arms, &s;mit with the renown of Albert's prowe&s;s, and ambitious of profiting by the narrative of his exploits, repaired with other warriors to his ho&s;pi|table ca&s;tle. His eye; keen and piercing, indicated a fiery, vigorous, and active &s;pirit. His form was well fitted to kindle de&s;ire in the bo&s;om of tender maids: and the heart of Adela was not in&s;en&s;ible to his merit.
<PB N="48" REF="032707_0047_0FF4328BBA09A698">
Their pa&s;&s;ion was mutual. He gazed on her unaffected charms with a&s;toni&s;hment; for, till then, he had never felt the tender anxiety, the re&s;tle&s;s longing and langui&s;h|ment of love. Ambition had been the governing pa&s;|&s;ion of his &s;oul: but the fiercene&s;s of ambition now yielded to a &s;ofter, tho no le&s;s ardent de&s;ire. He no longer di&s;cour&s;ed in keen rapture of mar&s;halled ho&s;ts, of li&s;ted fields, and feats of venturous men; but lan|gui&s;hed on the ineffable attractions of a ro&s;eate com|plexion, and tender melting eye. The vehement im|patience of the warrior was lo&s;t in the complacency and pen&s;iven<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;s of the lover.</P>
<P>Albert, perceiving this change in his deportment, demanded the cau&s;e, Edwin replied in candid and re&s;|pectful gui&s;e; he told him, without re&s;erve, of the im|pre&s;&s;ion made on his &s;oul by the peerle&s;s beauty of Ade|la; and, with the temerity of youthful pa&s;&s;ion, be|&s;ought him to ratify his &s;incere attachment by wedlock. "And who art thou, &s;aid the haughty baron, who pre|tende&s;t to the love of Adela? What feats of heroic prowe&s;s ha&s;t thou atchieved? Or is thy ance&s;try di&s;|tingui&s;hed among the chieftains of the &s;outh? Thy &s;hield is in&s;cribed with no valorous atchievment: no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> are thy deeds, nor the deeds of thy fathers, rehear&s;ed by recording min&s;trels. Gain thee a name in arms, and then a&s;pire to the envied alliance of the Hou&s;e of Al|bert" The&s;e words, like an arrow, penetrated the heart of Edwin. Love and ambition, hitherto at vari|ance, were now united, they concurred in the &s;ame pur&s;uit, and their vehemence was irre&s;i&s;table. Accord|ingly
<PB N="49" REF="032707_0048_0FF432D7637919B8">
the youthful warrior prepared for his departure, and took tender farewell of Adela. "Farewell, &s;he replied (the tears gu&s;hing from her radiant eyes) heaven knows, no gallant youth but thee ever &s;hared my affec|tions. May the holy angels, who regard true and vir|tuous love with e&s;teem, grant thee protection! &s;peedy be thy return! and O! remember me. Gay and courtly dames, &s;killed in &s;educement and cunning de|vice, may &s;trive to allure thee; but their love will not equal mine." They plighted vows of mutual <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, and exchanged tokens of un&s;haken attachment&punc; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Edwin, clad in complete armor, a gay undaunted war|rior, mounted a &s;teed proudly capari&s;oned, and bent <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> cour&s;e to the plains of Catalonia, where the Saracen waded in the blood of Spain.</P>
<P>Soon after his departure, Edgar, a proud and weal|thy chieftain, with a numerous retinue of knights and retainers, came to the ca&s;tle of Albert. He was received with pomp and ho&s;pitable welcome. He ca&s;t amorous glances on the re&s;erved, unrivaled charms of Adela. He prefered his court&s;hip with &s;tudied &s;miles, and &s;peeches devi&s;ed with cunning. She heard him at fir&s;t with in|difference; he per&s;i&s;ted, and &s;he requited him with con|tempt. He then addre&s;&s;ed his &s;uit to the baron: he boa&s;ted of the high renown of his ance&s;tors, and the wide extent of his domain; he expatiated on the num|ber of his va&s;&s;als; and in&s;i&s;ted, in magnificent terms, on the mutual honor and &s;ecurity that would accrue from &s;o &s;eemly an alliance. Albert li&s;tened to him with par|tial and plea&s;ed attention; he repented of the hopes he
<PB N="50" REF="032707_0049_0FF432DE6A745CC8">
had encouraged in the &s;oul of Edwin; and endeavored to per&s;uade his daughter to forget her attachment to that valiant youth. In vain the a&s;toni&s;hed Adela lamented, wept, entreated; in vain &s;he threw her&s;elf at her father's feet, and tore her di&s;hev<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lled tre&s;&s;es, and in angui&s;h &s;mote her brea&s;t. Her oppo&s;ition, in&s;tead of mitigating his rigor, irritated his re&s;entment, and confirmed him in his ungenerous purpo&s;e. He mingled menaces and unkindly reproach with his per&s;ua&s;ions: "By the holy rod, &s;aid he, with a fa&s;tidious and wrathful a&s;pect, the honor of my hou&s;e &s;hall not be &s;tained by the preten|&s;ions of a low born boy. Degenerated as thou art, the meanne&s;s of thy &s;entiments &s;hall not fully the &s;plendor of thine ance&s;try, nor load my re&s;pectful age with di&s;|honor. Receive the addre&s;&s;es of Edgar with &s;uitable regard, and the deference due to my commands. Mean time preparations &s;hall be made for the bridal &s;olemnity in a manner becoming the dignity of this alliance."</P>
<P>Adela, after remon&s;trating in vain again&s;t the &s;ever|ity of his commands, intreated, with an humble and dejected air, that the marriage ceremony might be de|layed. "Can Edgar, &s;aid &s;he, prize the cold and eon|&s;trained embraces of a heart that throbs for another? Will the &s;ighing and angui&s;h of a broken &s;pirit accord with the fond care&s;&s;es of a bridegroom? To Edwin my faith was plighted, and on him my imagination hath dwelt. Give me time, therefore, to divert the current of an affection too violent to be &s;uddenly oppo&s;ed; to di&s;courage the reveries of fancy, animated by a legal and habituated pa&s;&s;ion; and to reconcile my&s;elf to the
<PB N="51" REF="032707_0050_0FF4331257409B30">
addre&s;&s;es of Edgar." As her rea&s;oning was plau&s;ible, the nuptial &s;olemnity was deferred. But, as &s;oon as &s;he had retired from her father's pre&s;ence, &s;he &s;ummon|ed a page in whom &s;he confided, and &s;poke to him in the following manner: "Prepare thee for a long journ|ey: &s;addle the &s;l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ete&s;t of my father's &s;teeds, and dur|ing the ob&s;curity of the night depart. Hie thee to the b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nks of the Ebro; find Edwin; tell him of the perils that be&s;et me; tell him that a wealthy and powerful rival, with co&s;tly parade, and glittering &s;how of blazon|ry, hath impo&s;ed on my father, and in&s;inuated him&s;elf into his e&s;teem." The menial bowed with humble obei&s;ance, and, with profe&s;&s;ions of diligence and fideli|ty, departed.</P>
<P>Mean time Edgar pre&s;&s;ed his &s;uit with courteous phra&s;e and dalliance. Daily tournaments were exhib|ited at the ca&s;tle of Albert. The knights and barons of the neighboring domains attended: but Edgar &s;urpa&s;&s;ed them in the &s;plendor of his armor, and the pomp of his retinue. The hall re&s;ounded with revelry and rejoicing; and min&s;trels, clad in gaudy apparel, celebrated the prai&s;es of warlike chiefs, or &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ng the power and the plea&s;ures of love. Adela arrayed her countenance with &s;miles and courte&s;y; but her bo&s;om was di&s;tracted with angui&s;h. "O when, &s;he cried, &s;hall I be delivered from the importunity of a dete&s;ted &s;uitor, and the bondage of feigned complacency? When will Edwin return, adorned with conque&s;t, and confident with &s;ucce&s;s? His merit &s;hall &s;hine unri|valed; and Edgar &s;hall be covered with &s;hame." At
<PB N="52" REF="032707_0051_0FF42A638409A160">
length the page returned; and, repairing to the apart|ment of his mournful mi&s;tre&s;s, "Now heaven forbid, &s;aid he, mo&s;t gracious lady, that the tidings I bring &s;hould injure thy tender frame more than thou art able to endure. May the &s;aints and mini&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ring angels <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">|hold thee!"&mdash;"Hath he peri&s;hed? cried Adela, with a look of terror and amazement, in what bloody field hath he fallen? Where li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> the lifele&s;s body? What barbarous adver&s;ary hath mangled and in&s;ulted his graceful form?" "He hath not peri&s;hed replied the attendant. But, O gentle lady! foul arts have been practi&s;ed; &s;hameful perfidy hath been committed. Ed|win lives, but not for thee; he hath given his hand to another!" "Peace! peace! interrupted Adela, with a faultering utterance and looks of a&s;toni&s;hment mixed with anger, re&s;train thy bla&s;phemous &s;peech, nor with ba&s;e calumny a&s;per&s;e the fame of a true and gallant warrior." "When, an&s;wered the menial, have I been guilty of deceit or infidelity towards my gen|tle mi&s;tre&s;s? full &s;ore it grieveth me to be the me&s;&s;en|ger of evil tidings." "Rehear&s;e them unre&s;ervedly, cried Adela, with a tone of anxious impatience."</P>
<P>"I pur&s;ued my journey, &s;aid he, many days, without any adventure, till I came within &s;ight of a &s;tately ca&s;|tle. It &s;tood on a brow of a woody hill; was garni&s;h|ed with towers and battlements; and commanded a wide pro&s;pect of cultivated fields and fore&s;ts. As I advanced mine ear was &s;uddenly &s;urpri&s;ed with the din of hounds and horns, mingled with the cries of the hunt&s;men. I &s;oon de&s;cried a gallant &s;how of knights
<PB N="53" REF="032707_0052_0FF42AA03B576418">
and gorgeous dames, mounted on milk-white cou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ers, and pur&s;uing the rapid deer. When the chace was ended, they &s;topped by the &s;ide of a cry&s;tal brook; and a comely youth, arrayed in &s;hining apparel, light|ing from his foamy &s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">d, with courtly obei&s;ance pre|&s;ented the prey to a fair &s;miling lady. I mingled in their company, and in the lineaments of the courteous youth recogni&s;ed the incon&s;tant Edwin. O gentle la|dy, may Heaven &s;o help me in my utmo&s;t need, as I now &s;peak the words of truth; and may the &s;aints and holy angels &s;o &s;uccour thee as thy mi&s;hap requires! The faithle&s;s youth hath committed trea&s;on again&s;t thy love; &s;educed by the blandi&s;hment of an artful dame, he hath become forgetful of thy peerle&s;s beauty."</P>
<P>The heart of Adela throbbed with angui&s;h during the recital. "Valorous, heroic warrior! &s;he exclaim|ed, are the&s;e thy deeds of hardy prowe&s;s, to betray the innocent credulity of an ea&s;y maid? Stain to manhood, and the honoured profe&s;&s;ion of arms, be henceforth ban|i&s;hed from my remembrance?"</P>
<P>Edgar now advanced his &s;uit with redoubled ardor. Albert, unable to brook any longer delay in&s;i&s;ted on having the bridal ceremony &s;olemnized; and Adela, in|cited by &s;ecret pride and re&s;entment, &s;ubmitted to the will of her father. The report of this noble alliance was publi&s;hed thro the land; and the kindred of Albert and Edgar, with the neighboring barons, were a&s;&s;em|bled to grace the &s;olemnity. Already were the parties betrothed; the holy benediction was already pronounc|ed; and forever was Adela to be the wedded &s;pou&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of

Edgar. Now, with pompous &s;how and attendance, the banquet was &s;erved up to dames and knights, the flow|er of courte&s;y and valor. The ca&s;tle re&s;ounded with min&s;trel&s;y, and the dance; when a &s;tranger, in the &s;im|ple garb of a pilgrim, entered the hall. He ca&s;t his eyes around on the goodly company, and with an ai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of &s;anctity and re&s;pect, implored a ble&s;&s;ing on their fel|low&s;hip. He was received with ho&s;pitable welcome, and the reverence due to his holy &s;emblance. He &s;pake in meek and mode&s;t gui&s;e; his eyes were often fixed on Adela; they were &s;ometimes dimmed with a gli&s;tening tear; and ever and anon his bo&s;om heaved with involuntary &s;ighs. He took the harp of a min|&s;trel; he touched the &s;trings with ma&s;terly cunning and accompanied the notes with a melodious voice. Tuneful, but melancholy was the &s;train: for he &s;ung the &s;orrows of tho&s;e that are for&s;aken; the angui&s;h of a de&s;ponding &s;pirit; and the wounds inflicted on a faith|ful heart, by incon&s;tancy and proud di&s;dain. He de|&s;i&s;ted, with marks of grief and inward contention. "Holy pilgrim, &s;aid Albert, the &s;en&s;e of calamnity de|vours thy &s;pirit. Inform us of thy mi&s;hap, that, if po&s;|&s;ible, we may admini&s;ter comfort.

<P>"I am the &s;on of a freeman, replied the &s;tranger; and tho my birth was not enobled by &s;plendid titles, nor my ance&s;try di&s;tingui&s;hed by the parade of blazon|ry, my bo&s;om burned with the love of arms, and my heart was upright. In an unlucky hour I became en|amored
<PB N="55" REF="032707_0054_0FF43314731BE0A8">
of a gentle dame, the only daughter of a noble baron. My &s;incere, tho pre&s;umptuous &s;uit, &s;eemed not di&s;plea&s;ing to that peerle&s;s beauty; and with the ra&s;h, intemperate boldne&s;s of a lover, I a&s;ked her in marriage of her &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e. Go, &s;aid he, gain thee a name in arms, and then a&s;pire to the envied alliance of my hou&s;e. I de|parted, not without a tender interchange of vows and tokens of affection with the beloved idol of my heart. I ha&s;tened to the plains of Catalonia, where the Saracen was waging fierce battles again&s;t the banner of the holy cro&s;s. I proffered my &s;ervice to the chief of the Chri&s;|tians; and that my &s;word was not idle, and that I was not, backward in the &s;trife of arms, my honorable wounds can te&s;tify. Neither were my &s;ervices, nor my thir&s;t after martial fame unrewarded. Fair recom|pences have I received, and the &s;un of glory hath gild|ed the ob&s;curity of my birth. Rejoicing in my &s;uc|ce&s;s, I ha&s;tened my return. But what power of utter|ance can expre&s;s the agony of my &s;oul, when I learned that the faithle&s;s and incon&s;tant fair had yielded to the vows of another? I who was &s;o true and loyal to my love and plighted truth, to be &s;o &s;oon forgotten, &s;o &s;oon for&s;aken!"</P>
<P>"Enough, enough, cried Adela, O ill requited lov|er! pierce not my &s;oul with deeper wounds. O Ed|win! Edwin! never was I incon&s;tant. Bear witne&s;s, ye holy angels! but traiterous guile hath been practi&s;ed: thy integrity hath been impeached, and my vexed heart betrayed into error."</P>
<P>The eyes of all were now turned on the &s;tranger:
<PB N="56" REF="032707_0055_0FF432E7EF2BF550">
he threw off his di&s;gui&s;e, and, in&s;tead of a pilgrim's &s;taff, he gra&s;ped a keen and trenchant weapon. Re|&s;entment glowed in his cheeks, and fla&s;hed from his fiery eyes. "And who, &s;aid he, hath impeached mine integrity? Stand forth, thou proud, but da&s;tard ba|ron, who&s;e glo&s;&s;ing tales have betrayed the unwary heart of a maiden: it is Edwin demands reparation." Con&s;cious fear was manife&s;t in the di&s;ordered features, the pale cheek, and di&s;concerted air of Edgar. He neverthele&s;s accepted the challenge: and the warriors, arraying them&s;elves in complete armor, de&s;cended in|to the court of the ca&s;tle. In the fir&s;t on&s;et, the well tempered &s;teel of Edwin cleft the cre&s;ted helm of his adver&s;ary; he threw him to the ground, and di&s;armed him. "Confe&s;s thy guilt, &s;aid the conqueror, and by what infamous arts thou ha&s;t accompli&s;hed the de&s;ign."&mdash;By gifts and glittering gold he replied, I cor|rupted the page of Adela, who with counterfeited &s;em|blance of fidelity and regret, accu&s;ed thee of incon&s;tan|cy, and impo&s;ed fal&s;ehood on the ear of his mi&s;tre&s;s. I embraced the &s;ea&s;on of her excited re&s;entment, and forwarded my &s;uit with &s;ucce&s;s. She is mine by the indi&s;&s;oluble ties of wedlock: and know, proud boy that, if thy hands be &s;tained with my blood, it is the blood of Adela's hu&s;band; and if &s;he receives thee to her bo&s;om, &s;he receives the &s;layer of her &s;pou&s;e."</P>
<P>Edwin &s;tarted with apparent horror. He pau&s;ed; but recollecting him&s;elf, "ari&s;e he cried, and by anoth|er trial, prove thy&s;elf worthy of that envied title." So

&s;aying, he rai&s;ed him from the ground, and both war|riors addre&s;&s;ed them&s;elves a &s;econd time to the fight. Edgar, burning with exa&s;perated rancor, aimed his &s;pear at his rival's brea&s;t. Edwin neither averted nor avoided the deadly blow. The keen weapon cleft his brea&s;t, and was tinged in the purple &s;prings of his heart. He fell to the ground. "Farewell, he cried, Adela! lady peerle&s;s! and dearly beloved. I have proved my&s;elf worthy of thy e&s;teem: I die a &s;acrifice to thy repo&s;e. With my hands red with thy hu&s;band's blood, could I ever a&s;pire to thy love? Could I &s;urvive and behold thee wedded bride of another?" He heav|ed a &s;igh, and died. "Inhuman deed! cried Adela, tearing her lovely tre&s;&s;es, and beating her &s;now white brea&s;t: &s;he ran, &s;he threw her&s;elf on the lifele&s;s body.

<P>In&s;tantly the page, who had been corrupted by Edger, &s;eizing a daggar, ru&s;hed behind that teacherous baron, and pierced him to the heart. "Peri&s;h! he cried, author of my ruin, and of the ruin of the Hou&s;e of Albert."

<P>IN one of tho&s;e incur&s;ions formerly made by the <HI>Tartars</HI> on the Ru&s;&s;ian monarchy, <HI>O&s;man,</HI> who at that time headed a party, had the good fortune to pre&s;erve a beautiful gi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l, about &s;even years old, from falling a &s;acrifice to the relentle&s;s &s;word; and conceiving great expectations form her &s;urpri&s;ing charms, carried her into Tartary, and educated her with all tho&s;e accom|pli&s;hments nece&s;&s;ary to render her a fit pre&s;ent for the Sultan. The perfections of her mind and per&s;on being improved to his wi&s;h, &s;he was no &s;ooner arrived at a proper age, than he &s;et out with her towards Con&s;tant|inople. In their journey meeting with a company of <HI>Polanders,</HI> he was in great danger of lo&s;ing his prize, and the innocence of the beautiful <HI>Selima</HI> had certainly been the prey of the &s;avage hand, had not <HI>Mirzim,</HI> a great favorite of the Sultan, happened to come that way with a numerous retinue, and put the ravi&s;hers to flight.</P>
<P>The deliverer and the delivered were in the &s;ame in&s;tant in&s;pired with a mutual pa&s;&s;ion for each other;
<PB N="59" REF="032707_0058_0FF4331738DEAB88">
but Mirzim, under&s;tanding O&s;man's de&s;ign, made no public &s;how of his affection; and Selima as carefully concealed her<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s. To retard, however, as long as po&s;&s;i|ble being carried to Con&s;tantinople, &s;he pretended &s;ick|ne&s;s, and was every day vi&s;ited by her lover di&s;gui&s;ed as a phy&s;ician; and this frequent intercour&s;e making them perfectly acquainted with each other's merit, e&s;tabli&s;hed a tenderne&s;s, which ended not but with their lives.</P>
<P>Thus they continued giving and receiving all th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> marks that virtue would permit of the fonde&s;t and mo&s;t di&s;intere&s;ted pa&s;&s;ion, till Mirzim received a mandate from the Sultan, creating him Grand Vi&s;ir, and at the &s;ame time commanding him to go at the head of a pow|erful army to the relief of <HI>Buda,</HI> then be&s;ieged by the Emperor of Germany. The cruel &s;eperation mu&s;t be now endured, not all his love could render Mirzim neglectful of the duty be owed to his imperial ma&s;ter, his country, and his honor; and Selima had too true &s;en&s;e of the latter to delay his ha&s;tening where glory called. He took his leave, and &s;he was now obliged to acknowledge her&s;elf re|covered, le&s;t a real phy&s;ician &s;hould di&s;cover &s;he had but counterfeited indi&s;po&s;ition. O&s;man pro&s;ecuted his journey, and in a &s;hort time reached Con&s;tantinople; where, he agreed with the <HI>K<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ter Aga</HI> of the Sirago and the charming maid was to be delivered to him, in order to be pre&s;ented to the &s;ultan at a &s;it opportunity. The dry appointed being arrived, &s;he could no longer re&s;train the &s;truggling emotions of her &s;oul, &s;he kneels, &s;he

weeps: &s;he intreats O&s;man to change his re&s;olution, and at la&s;t reveals the &s;ecret of her love for Mirzim; but all is now too late, the compact is made and &s;he mu&s;t by force &s;ubmit.</P>
<P>Mirzim returned from his expedition the &s;ame day&punc; but in a condition far different from what he had hoped at his embarking in it: he had flattered him&s;elf with being able to do things which might enable him to beg the charming Selima of the Sultan as a reward of his &s;ervices; but in&s;tead of laurels, he was covered with confu&s;ion; all his de&s;igns had proved un&s;ucce&s;sful; <HI>Buda</HI> was taken before his face, and he was obliged to acertificate from the &s;ubaltern officers to clear his con|duct to the Sultan. If any &s;hadow of comfort appeared to him, it was in the friend&s;hip of the <HI>Ki&s;ler Aga,</HI> who promi&s;ed him to conceal the beauty of Selima as much as po&s;&s;ible from the Sultan's knowledge; but tho this eunuch kept his word inviolably a new and undreamed of misfortune befel their loves. Zara, a creature of Prince Mu&s;tapha, the brother of the Sultan, no &s;ooner beheld this lovely maid, than &s;he began to ca&s;t about in her mind how to procure her for him, and &s;oon after intro|duced him to her apartment: he was immediately e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|amored of her beauty, but her behavior gave him equal de&s;pair. Mirzim being informed of this vi&s;it, and the effects of it, writes a letter to a friend complaining of the &s;everity of his face in rai&s;ing him a new rival. The <HI>Ki&s;ler Aga</HI> had the charge of delivering it but being called away on &s;ome important bu&s;ine&s;s, entru&s;ts it to a &s;lave, who gives it into Zara's hand, &s;he communicates
<PB N="61" REF="032707_0060_0FF42AA917B152A8">
it to Prince Mu&s;tapha, who, ignorant of the character, and no name being &s;ub&s;cribed, is fired with extreme impatience to di&s;cover this happy favorite. At this in|&s;tant Achmet and Ibrahim, two di&s;contented courtiers, enter his apartment; to them he relates the &s;tory of his love and jealou&s;y, and is by them informed, the letter which gave him &s;o much pain, was the Vi&s;ir's hand; and they take this opportunity of per&s;uading him to appear at the head of a party already formed for de|throning the Sultan; this they a&s;&s;ure him is the only means by which he can attain the enjoyment of his mi&s;tre&s;s, or the de&s;truction of his rival.</P>
<P>How great &s;oever the weight of the&s;e rea&s;ons were to him as a lover, tho&s;e of nature and of duty had not le&s;s efficacy; he could not pre&s;ently be brought to take up arms again&s;t his &s;ovreign and brother, nor yet could he think of &s;eeing his adored Selima torn from him; he therefore de&s;ires time for con&s;ideration &amp; in this tempe&s;t of his &s;oul, the <HI>Ki&s;ler Aga</HI> having found the mi&s;carriage of the letter, and judging into who&s;e hands it was fallen, makes him an offer of his &s;ervice, and &s;o artfully gains the belief and confidence of this un&s;u&s;pecting prince, that he prevails with him to give him the letter on pre|tence of confronting Mirzim, and obliging him by me|naces to de&s;i&s;t.</P>
<P>In the mean time Achmet and Ibrahim, having per|ceived that the only way to bring Mu&s;tapha into their plot, is the immediate danger of lo&s;ing Selima, &s;ecretly inform the Sultan how beautiful a creature is in the <HI>Ki&s;ler Aga's</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; on which the impatient monarch

commands &s;he &s;hall be brought in&s;tantly to his pre&s;ence&punc; as &s;oon as &s;he appeared, her charms had their ordinary effect, the Sultan's heart yielded to a pa&s;&s;ion not infe|rior to that &s;he had in&s;pired in his brother or the Vi&s;ir; and finding her wit and virtue as matchle&s;s as her per|&s;on, he re&s;olves to make her Empre&s;s, and defer the gratification of his love till the celebration of tho&s;e rites, which &s;hould yield her to him without a blu&s;h.</P>
<P>All the &s;cruples which had hitherto &s;ubdued the dictates of ambition in Mu&s;tapha, were now &s;ilenced by the calls of a more powerful pa&s;&s;ion: he enters into the mea&s;ures Achmet and Ibrahim had propo&s;ed, and perceives they had already carried things to &s;uch a height, that there wanted little more than his con&s;ent to pluck his brother from the throne; the Vi&s;ir's well known loyalty was the only impediment he had to &s;truggle with; it was therefore nece&s;&s;ary to begin with his de&s;truction, and chance &s;oon furni&s;hed means.</P>
<P>That de&s;pairing lover had prevailed with the <HI>Ki&s;ler Aga</HI> to admit him in a di&s;gui&s;e to take a la&s;t farewell of his dear Selima, and the contrivance by which he was to be introduced being overheard by Achmet, he that moment di&s;patches Ibrahim to the Sultan to acquaint him with it; who going in per&s;on to the apartment of Selima finds Mirzim with her. All denials of their mutual pa&s;&s;ion would be now in vain; they boldly own it, and the Vi&s;ir is ordered to immediate death. Mirzim in the confu&s;ion of this dreadful incident drops a paper, which the Sultan t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">kes up and reads. This was the

<P>While the Sultan is thus employed, the Divan and army have declared for Mu&s;tapha; but that prince be|ing informed of the Vi&s;ir's genero&s;ity in choo&s;ing rat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">er to endure the rack than betray him, tho his rival, &s;ends his commands for his pre&s;ervation.</P>
<P>The Sultan hearing what was done again&s;t him, goes at the head of his jani&s;&s;aries, to oppo&s;e his brother, but they revolting, at the &s;ight of Mu&s;tapha, he was compel|led to yield to his de&s;tiny, and pa&s;s the remainder of his life dive&s;ted of all power.

<P>Mu&s;tapha, now &s;upreme, thinks of nothing but &s;har|ing the Imperial dignity with Selima; but that faithful maid a&s;&s;uring him, that &s;he had long &s;ince made a vow to Mirzim, her un&s;haken fidelity, and the con&s;ideration how much he was indebted to &s;o generous a rival, de|termined him after a long and &s;evere &s;truggle with him|&s;elf to crown the happine&s;s of &s;o de&s;erving a pair; and to re&s;tore Mirzim to the dignity of Grand Vi&s;ir.</P>

<HEAD>THE <HI>WEASLES</HI> AND THE <HI>FERRETS.</HI> AN OCCASIONAL FABLE.</HEAD>
<P>IN ancient days, before man extended his do|minion over the extreme&s;t limits of the earth, there was an i&s;land in the Northern Seas, inhabited only by the different &s;pecies of the quadruped kingdom; who, for a time, having no general ruler or ma&s;ter, lived in perfect ca&s;e and happine&s;s. Tranquil &s;tates, however, never are of long duration; the want of one general lord made them &s;oon begin to lord it ever one another, and the Ferrets, a knavi&s;h and cunning, as well as extremely ambitious, tho weak people, look it into their heads to e&s;tab|li&s;h an univer&s;al monarchy, of which their king &s;hould always be at head.</P>
<P>Slavery is a contagious evil; the king of the Ferrets had found means to make him&s;elf an ab&s;olute and de&s;|potic tyrant over them, and the &s;ubjects &s;eemed intent on nothing &s;o much as reducing the whole i&s;land, which was to them a world, into the &s;ame abject &s;tate with them&s;elves. Their tyran<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> had taught them to think his grandeur their greate&s;t glory. This &s;eemed a very ab|&s;urd doctrine in the fir&s;t age, when it was advanced; but as all opinions mellow by u&s;e, and the mo&s;t ungrate|ful things become familiar by habit, the favorite opin|ion of the court had been handed down from father to &s;on, till in a few reigns it became as ab&s;urd to di&s;pute, as it had at fir&s;t been to believe it. In this &s;tate were

things in our i&s;land, when the king of the Ferrets, &s;um|moning his people about him, addre&s;&s;ed them in the&s;e words: You &s;ee, my &s;ubjects, we live among a great number of different &s;tates, each of which has its pecu|liar king, but there is yet no monarch of the whole.

<P>As the fire eyed tyrant ended his &s;peech, he &s;talked away in a maje&s;tic manner, attended by his courtiers: great murmurs were rai&s;ed among the people; many &s;crupled to give in their money, more to expo&s;e their lives, and &s;ome to murder innocent people, who had done them no injury, only at his command; but they had made a tyrant, and they found they mu&s;t obey him. The Ferrets of broken fortunes entered readily to mend them, and tho&s;e in better circum&s;tances, becau&s;e they could not help it&punc; however, all entered. The whole country inhabited by the&s;e animals was &s;tripped of its inhabitants, and the tyrant &s;aw him&s;elf at the head of a very numerous and powerful army. With his bribes and emi&s;&s;aries at the &s;tronger courts, and this army at his heels, he marched again&s;t the weaker provinces; he flattered him&s;elf every thing was in his power, all bu&s;i|ne&s;s, but that of conque&s;t was neglected, and all thoughts but that of victory at once de&s;erted the &s;ouls of prince and people. The inhabitants of this i&s;land were all of the &s;maller kind of animals, &s;o that they had no de&s;troy|ers

of their own kind to fear; the lion, the leopard, and the wolf were not known there: only a creature of another kind &s;wept them off with a very fatal havoc; this was a mon&s;trous &s;erpent known among them by a name which in their language &s;ignified death. He was cunning enough to way lay them in a thou&s;and dif|ferent manners, and their only defence again&s;t him was by means of water, for he hated &s;wimming, &s;o that, while he was kept off from them by trenches filled with water, he only now and then came over and &s;napped them up one by one, as his natural hunger required; but, if this defence was away at any time, he devoured them by millions. Every province therefore allotted a great number of its inhabitants to work high up in the coun|try, at the &s;ources of rivers and brooks, to turn their currents in, and give annually a fre&s;h &s;upply of this their liquid wall; this was a nece&s;&s;ary &s;ervice, and on the labor of the&s;e the lives of all depended. The Fer|ret king however, inflamed with the lu&s;t of univer&s;al tyranny, &s;pared not even his &s;ubjects, who were thus employed, but commanded all into his army; in vain was it repre&s;ented to him, that, when the fir&s;t or &s;econd year was out, he would have no water, and that by that time his neighbors would be all too much his enemies to &s;upply him; he arrogantly an&s;wered fear not that, they &s;hall by that time be all my &s;laves and then we cannot want what they are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of.</P>

The whole nation of the Wea&s;els applauded to the clouds, the wi&s;dom of their &s;overeign; and an army was &s;oon formed on this pla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. The&s;e met the great power of the Ferret tyrant, while others were engaged in different places with his par|ties. He &s;tirred up private di&s;&s;entions where he could not come or &s;end his troops in per&s;on; and even &s;trip|ped his be&s;t friends of all their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, under the &s;pecious pretence of keeping them for them, and pre|&s;erving them from falling into the hands of his, and, as he cho&s;e to expre&s;s it, their enemies. Thus the whole i&s;land, before &s;o peaceable and happy, was by the ambitious views of one prince turned into a &s;cene of blood and murther.</P>
<P>Battles were fought with various &s;ucce&s;s in different places, but the re&s;i&s;tle&s;s numbers of the main body of the Ferret army made it every where too &s;ucce&s;sful, and victories and conquered provinces crowned all its attempts. The i&s;land was alarmed with the impending danger, when the illcon&s;tructed fabrick began to &s;ink by its own weight. The armies of the Wea&s;els and their friends though they could not prevent, had greatly &s;topped the rapid progre&s;s of the Ferrets, and as the&s;e could be &s;upported without injuring their country, being rai&s;ed on judicous plans,
<PB N="71" REF="032707_0070_0FF43322324D6160">
&s;o the Ferret army, gathered in ha&s;te, and managed without true prudence, now found it&s;elf peri&s;hing with its country, and &s;oon fell into de&s;pair amid&s;t its glorious conque&s;ts.</P>
<P>The &s;upplies of water failed, the trenches became dry, and the grand de&s;troyer, the Serpent, marched in horrid pomp with all his retinue over them, and thou|&s;ands fell before him every day. The tyrant now be|held his army peri&s;hing, before his work was yet half done: he knew there was no way to &s;ave them, but by the relief and a&s;&s;i&s;tance of tho&s;e he was now at war with, and he therefore humbly &s;ued for peace.</P>
<P>The Wea&s;els, who had armed only for the &s;ake of peace, which they wi&s;hed to give to the whole earth, readily con&s;ented, and to encourage the new humbled tyrant to better behaviour for the future, gave it on ea&s;y terms. His &s;ubtle heart, however, was not to be won by good; he had a deeply de&s;tructive plan con|trived, while all was open and free on the Wea&s;els &s;ide. Both agreed to &s;end off their armies to different quarters, and, as &s;oon as articles of peace were agreed on, the generous Wea&s;els &s;topped the rage of death among their late enemies, by throwing water from their own rivers into their trenches. The Serpent was now driven off again, and no ho&s;tilities were thought of again&s;t the Ferrets, when a thou&s;and &s;cenes of rapine and murther were at once let loo&s;e upon the Wea&s;els, by the per|fidious enemy; when this was complained of, the double dealing tyrant delared his &s;ubjects had not done this,

but that it was the <HI>Polecat</HI> nation who had been guilty of it, and with whom the Wea&s;els had no di&s;pute.</P>
<P>The Wea&s;el monarch received the lying an&s;wer as he ought; A&s;k your perfidious king, &s;aid he, to the am|ba&s;&s;ador, whether he thinks Wea&s;els have not eyes to di&s;tingui&s;h black from white, and tell him withal, his actions and tho&s;e of his &s;ubjects &s;tink to the whole world, though their carca&s;es do not; and they &s;hall be revenged. Let him beware: he has begun his treach|ery too early, &amp; will find by the event, that the &s;tings of his perfidy will return with tenfold violence on the head of him who is guilty of it. He di&s;mi&s;&s;ed him with the&s;e words, when an old and &s;age Wea&s;el, well known to his country by his &s;ervices, aro&s;e and addre&s;&s;ed his &s;ovreign in the&s;e words:</P>
<P>"What I have to offer &s;eems but the tenour, of your maje&s;ty's own thoughts; let us now puni&s;h this breaker of treaties as we ought; he &s;oon mu&s;t bend to us again, and let us then make him feel the weight of his la&s;t crime.

<P>This ju&s;t advice was followed; a few years brought the haughty victor again to be a &s;upplicant; death raged among his &s;ubjects with an uncontrolled &s;way, and &s;wept them daily in &s;uch numbers from his &s;ide, that he was forced to yield to &s;uch conditions as made the whole i&s;land afterwards happy for many ages.</P>

&s;tile them&s;elves, "<HI>the better &s;ort.</HI>" An example of this kind it pourtrayed in the following fact.</P>
<P><HI>Florimore</HI> and <HI>Leontine</HI> were the only &s;ons of two gentlemen, who&s;e e&s;tates were contiguous, and who re&s;ided in a town &s;ituate in the we&s;tern part of Ma&s;&s;a|chu&s;etts. In the innocent amu&s;ement of childhood, they were con&s;tant partners; through the playful &s;cenes of youth, they walk'd hand in hand. They were in&s;tructed by the &s;ame preceptor; ta&s;ted the &s;weets of &s;cience from the &s;ame cup, and the &s;ame college wit|ne&s;&s;ed the progre&s;&s;ive improvment of two minds, which bid fair, in their expan&s;ion, to enlighten and ble&s;s &s;ociety.</P>
<P>Having completed their collegiate education, they retired to &s;pend a few months in their native town, and to enjoy the company of tho&s;e who&s;e paternal fondne&s;s had enabled them to tread the paths of knowledge with honor; and who&s;e attention to the improvement of their under&s;tandings, in the days of youth, had a&s;&s;i&s;ted them to gain the applau&s;e of the learned world.</P>
<P>The time at length arrives when they mu&s;t part.&mdash; It was the wi&s;h of <HI>Florimore's</HI> father that he &s;hould de|vote his talents to the mini&s;try of the go&s;pel of peace&mdash; with that wi&s;h the willing &s;on coincided.&mdash;<HI>Leontine's</HI> di&s;|po&s;ition led him to the &s;tudy of phy&s;ic.&mdash;They part, in pur&s;uit of their different callings.&mdash;No vows were nece&s;&s;ary to cement and perpetuate the friend&s;hip&mdash; an intimacy for years had formed an union, which noth|ing but death could di&s;&s;olve.</P>
<P><HI>Florimore,</HI> had completed his &s;tudies, and was inducted into the pa&s;toral office, to take charge of a flock, who
<PB N="75" REF="032707_0074_0FF43328AE687E40">
delighted in his mini&s;try, and who were enraptured with the propriety and amiablene&s;s of his conduct in the private walks of life&mdash;indeed, his heart was the receptacle of every finer feeling; the &s;igh of &s;ympathy ever e&s;caped him, at the tale of another's woe, and the tear of pity &s;treamed from his eye, at the &s;ight of human mi&s;ery. But the &s;igh of &s;ympathy, and the tear of pity, were not the only con&s;olations which <HI>Florimore</HI> afforded to the &s;ons and daughters of di&s;tre&s;s. His ho&s;|pitable board bid welcome to the hungry and the thir&s;ty, and his wardrobe often furni&s;hed a cloak for the naked, &s;hivering mendicant.</P>
<P>About this time <HI>Leontine</HI> was u&s;hered into the notice of the world, as a Phy&s;ician. He was &s;oon celebrated for an uncommon &s;hare of &s;kill in his profe&s;&s;ion, and for his attention and humamity to his patients. His practice became exten&s;ive, and his pro&s;pects were flour|i&s;hing. Though the love of wealth is predominant in mo&s;t minds, <HI>Leontine</HI> ever made it &s;ub&s;ervient to the calls of humanity. His attention and &s;kill were em|ployed equally with tho&s;e who moved in the ob&s;cure, humble paths of life, and tho&s;e who&s;e opulence enable them to revel in every luxury the world afford|ed.</P>
<P>At the clo&s;e of three years attention to the duties of his calling, <HI>Florimore,</HI> was &s;eized with a di&s;order, which his phy&s;icians apprehended would prove mor|tal. <HI>Leontine</HI> flew, on the wings of friend&s;hip, to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the beloved of his &s;oul. His &s;kilful aid, and the &s;miles of an overruling Providence, &s;oon di&s;|pelled

that anxiety, under which his pari&s;h and friends labored, le&s;t a blo&s;&s;om &s;o u&s;eful &s;hould be nipt in its opening. But though the re&s;pectable Clergyman got the better of his di&s;order, it left him in a very weak and debilitated &s;tate; and it was the decided opinion of the faculty, that he mu&s;t bid adieu to the walks of a clerical life. This intelligence impre&s;&s;ed the minds of the people of his charge, with the deepe&s;t &s;orrow;&mdash; nor was <HI>Florimore</HI> unaffected on the occa&s;ion, though he was &s;en&s;ible of the nece&s;&s;ity of a compliance with the opinion of his phy&s;icians. He, however, collected &s;ufficient &s;trength and fortitude, once more to a&s;cend the &s;acred de&s;k, and take an affectionate farewell of his beloved flock. Tears often choaked the pa&s;&s;age of his words; while melancholy, and heartfelt grief were depicted in the countenance of his audience. After this, he quitted the place of his late re&s;idence, and the prayers and ble&s;&s;ings of hundreds followed him to the man&s;ion of his affectionate parent.</P>
<P>A &s;hort time previous to this event, his father, from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he natural goodne&s;s and di&s;po&s;ition of his heart, had become bound, to a large amount, in order to &s;ave a di&s;tant relation from the walls of a pri&s;on. (But, oh! <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ngratitude, thou wor&s;t of fiends, how &s;hall I relate <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he tale of thy ba&s;ene&s;s.) This relation, in contempt of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he mo&s;t &s;olemn obligations, hardened again&s;t the op|eration of every principle of honour and genero&s;ity, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ecamped, and left his too credulous benefactors to the mercy of an unfeeling creditor, who &s;ternly demanded of <HI>Florimore's</HI> father the payment of every farthing.
<PB N="77" REF="032707_0076_0FF4332C6116CF58">
To &s;atisfy the demand the whole property of the un|fortunate gentleman was &s;old at public auction, nor did even the venerable man&s;ion or hou&s;ehold furni|ture remain the property of its former owner.&mdash;This event made &s;o deep an impre&s;&s;ion upon the aged gen|tleman's mind, that it brought on a di&s;ea&s;e, which &s;oon clo&s;ed his eyes upon all temporary objects; and he was entombed be&s;ide the remains of a once fond partner, who had not lived to behold this melancholy rever&s;e of fortune.</P>
<P>For &s;oms time <HI>Florimore</HI> remained incon&s;olable&mdash; nor could every a&s;&s;i&s;tance which the genuine friend&s;hip of <HI>Leontine</HI> be&s;towed, di&s;pel the gloom from his mind, or revive his depre&s;&s;ed &s;pirits. At length, however, calm reflection re&s;umed her place in his &s;oul; and a di&s;|po&s;ition to &s;ubmit with re&s;ignation to the divine will, triumphed in his mind. "<HI>The Lord hath given</HI> (&s;aid he) <HI>the Lord hath taken away; and ble&s;&s;ed be his name.</HI>"</P>
<P>At the pre&s;&s;ing &s;olicitations of his friend, <HI>Florimore</HI> repaired to the ho&s;pitable dome of <HI>Leontine</HI>; and every hour which could be &s;pared from the calls of his pro|fe&s;&s;ion, <HI>Leontine</HI> devoted to &s;olace the cares, and &s;weet|en the hours of him whom his &s;oul loved.</P>
<P><HI>Florimore's</HI> &s;tate of mind, and his bodily infirmities, prevented him from taking a part in the active pur&s;uits of life&mdash;and his friend had a&s;&s;ured him that no other &s;eparation than that which di&s;&s;olves all human ties, &s;hould ever take place between them.&mdash;In this &s;itua|tion, one of the mo&s;t important objects of <HI>Florimore</HI> was the cultivation of the infant mind of the young &s;on of

<HI>Leontine.</HI> And "well were all his cares repaid," by the progre&s;s which his pupil made in knowledge and information.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who, from their wealth and rank in life, move in what is termed a more exalted &s;phere, are of|ten nece&s;&s;itated to a&s;&s;ociate, in &s;ome degree, with that cla&s;s who have nothing but wealth to recommend them. It was <HI>Leontine's</HI> misfortune to be thus &s;ituated. At an entertainment given to the neighboring gentlemen, <HI>Ve&s;|pers</HI> made one of the company. He abounded in wealth but was an entire &s;tranger to every finer feeling of the &s;oul. The tale of di&s;tre&s;s made little or no im|pre&s;&s;ion upon his mind; and the poor, tho encircled with merit and virtue, be ever treated with rudene&s;s and di&s;dain. His rough and uncouth manners led him to expre&s;s his contempt of humble worth on all occa|&s;ions.&mdash;He was no &s;tranger to <HI>Florimore</HI>'s &s;ituation and circum&s;tances; and notwith&s;tanding his pre&s;ence, took occa&s;ion to fling out the mo&s;t bitter reflections and pointed &s;arca&s;ms, upon dependent objects.&mdash;<HI>Leontine</HI> perceiving the drift of his ob&s;ervations, and was &s;en&s;i|ble to whom they pointed. His noble &s;oul took fire at the affront, and he openly accu&s;ed <HI>Ve&s;pers</HI> not only of ill manners, but brutality. His re&s;entment led him further; he bid him depart from his pre&s;ence, nor ever darken again his doors with an object, that could bea&s;t of nothing but an human form; the world, continued he, can furni&s;h me if I want, with hundreds like your|&s;elf; but the world cannot give me another <HI>Florimore.</HI></P>

<P>Sir John Wentworth was a younger brother of a fam|ily, who by the death of an uncle in Oxford&s;hire be|came po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a title, but of nothing el&s;e; the baro|net, whom he &s;ucceeded in honor, had it in his power to bequeath every foot of his e&s;tate, as he thought proper, and as he never entertained any cordial affection for Sir John, he left it to a more di&s;tant relation. This was rather an unfortunate circum&s;tance for Sir John, who&s;e finances were not in a very flouri&s;hing &s;ituation &mdash;however as his per&s;on was hand&s;ome, his addre&s;s el|egant, and his education fini&s;hed, he did not quite de&s;|pair of obtaining a fortune &s;omewhat &s;uitable to his rank &mdash;nor was our baronet's expectations altogether with|out rea&s;on&mdash;to the qualities we have already de&s;cribed Sir John, added a deep di&s;&s;imulation, and a fa&s;cinating plau&s;ibility&mdash;he knew mankind well, and was inclined upon every occa&s;ion to profit by the weakne&s;s or gen|ero&s;ity of his acquaintance, nor was an opportunity long wanting to gratify his avarice&mdash;a young widow who had been left in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a large e&s;tate by the la&s;t will of a doating hu&s;band, &s;aw Sir John by accident at

Bath, liked, and married him; as love is &s;eldom accom|panied by prudence, &s;he would by no means lock up her fortune from the man &s;he had honored with her per&s;on.&mdash;It is true &s;he had a daughter by her former hu&s;band but what of that? She was in love with her pre&s;ent,&mdash;and we generally believe tho&s;e people are really worthy of our regard, whom we eagerly wi&s;h to de&s;erve it:&mdash;Be&s;ides this, Mi&s;s Milmour her daughter had ten thou&s;and pounds &s;ettled on her by her fath|er's will, which Lady Wentworth thought a very hand&s;ome provi&s;ion; and it was &s;o in reality, if her mother had not been her guardian, and this guardian's fate entirely at the di&s;po&s;al of Sir John. It is unnece&s;|&s;ary to dwell minutely upon particulars;&mdash;our baronet had married totally from intere&s;tive motives, and as we have already ob&s;erved, he was not the mo&s;t con&s;cien|tious of mankind,&mdash;he was not therefore united two years to his lady till he got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Mi&s;s Milmour's fortune, and in le&s;s than two years after, both the moth|er and the daughter were negligently loft at a mi&s;erable old <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eat above two hundred miles from the capital, where Lady Wentworth after undergoing every &s;pecies of mortification, and knowing that the man whom &s;he loved to di&s;traction publicly cohabited with another woman, died of a broken heart; leaving Mi&s;s Milmour wholly dependent on the genero&s;ity of a wretch whom &s;he her&s;elf had found &s;o utterly dive&s;ted not only of &s;entiment, but &s;hame, and not only of gratitude but of hone&s;ty.</P>

This greatly cooled the affections of the young lady's friends, who&s;e regard had for &s;ome time been gradually declining, from the unpromi&s;ing appearance of affairs, and &s;he was at la&s;t induced from motives of prudence as well as tenderne&s;s, to throw her&s;elf into the arms of a worthy young fellow who had a company in a march|ing regiment, and to whom &s;he was rendered addi|tionally dear, by the melancholy turn in her circum|&s;tances.</P>
<P>All this time it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed the world made very free with Sir John Wentworth's character; they exclaimed at his inhumanity in the very moment they ac|knowledged his politene&s;s, and tho the law had pro|nounced in his favour, the deci&s;ion by no means removed the reflections which were eternally thrown upon his character.&mdash;But though his name was frequently men|tioned with abhorrence, his company was never avoided; &amp; tho&s;e who acknowledged the cruelty of his di&s;po&s;ition, were the fir&s;t to give him invitations, and though they could &s;ay nothing in favour of his principles, they were always ready to declare that he was infinitely agreeable: Death, however, did not treat him &s;o polite|ly as the world did; it took him away in the mid&s;t of all his ill-gotten wealth, without a moment of pre|vious intimation, and an apoplexy &s;natched away at a

His language was copious, ele|gant and per&s;ua&s;ive: and his memory and under&s;tand|ing were of the highe&s;t degree of &s;trength. He had &s;tudied human nature for no intention but to prey on its weakne&s;&s;es, and he well knew when to take an op|portunity to in&s;inuate his pernicious principles. Gam|ing was his bu&s;ine&s;s, and to &s;eduction of females he was no &s;tranger. His per&s;onal courage was e&s;tabli&s;hed in the fa&s;hionable world, but upon no better foundation than his having killed in a duel the hu&s;band of a woman whom he had ruined, plundered and expo&s;ed to &s;hame. With the undi&s;cerning part of the world, he was a man of honour and of abilities.&mdash;In fact, he was totally de&s;titute of every virtue that can dignify man, and he practi&s;ed tho&s;e vices which brutes are incapable of, but which the imperfect &s;tate of our legi&s;lature leaves "unwhipt of ju&s;tice."</P>

But they had lo&s;t that which can &s;eldom be recalled; they lo&s;t the &s;potle&s;s purity of their minds; they &s;carcely ever recollected the princi|ples of their early education. The &s;en&s;ibilities of love and friend&s;hip were no longer felt. Avarice, envy, and rancour were now the leading pa&s;&s;ions, as they are the natural con&s;equence of gaming.

As their expences multiplied, they found it nece&s;&s;ary to have recour&s;e to other means than formerly: their father might weep over their infatuation, but he could no longer &s;upply their wants. The friends (as they were wont to call them) who had profited by their folly, re|fu&s;ed to contribute any a&s;&s;i&s;tance. The gaming table was their only place of refuge; but ignorant of the tricks of &s;harpers, they found that their &s;ucce&s;s here

<P>An offer was made by an opulent relation to purcha&s;e a commi&s;&s;ion in a regiment de&s;tined for for|eign &s;ervice. This was repre&s;ented to them by their parent, and the elde&s;t accepted the offer, while the other agreed to apply to the &s;tudy of commerce in the hou&s;e of an eminent merchant in London, to which they now removed, and their parents rejoiced at their departure from a place in which their fonde&s;t hopes had been &s;o &s;adly di&s;appointed.</P>
<P>Happy had it been, if their follies had now ended; if they had profited by their experience, dear bought as it was, and been reclaimed from vicious indulgencies. But the company they fell into in London, a place to which they were before &s;trangers, added to their imprudence. In a &s;hort time, by the common tran&s;itions of the life of a game&s;ter they were reduced to the greate&s;t di&s;tre&s;s. To complete all, when they found them&s;elves beyond all hopes of retrieving circum&s;tances, they took the de&s;|perate re&s;olution of going on the highway, determined to plunder or die in the attempt. They carried their purpo&s;e into execution; weary of life, they al&s;o re|&s;olved that if there &s;hould be danger of detection to rid them&s;elves of life by pi&s;tol or poi&s;on. If they &s;ucceed|ed, they were to leave of the pernicious practice off gaming, and amend that life which in its pre&s;ent &s;tate was a burthen. Such is the &s;ophi&s;try with which a game&s;ter grown de&s;perate amu&s;es his mind.</P>

<P>Such and &s;o fatal are the effects of gaming. When a <HI>harmle&s;s game of cards,</HI> as it is called, becomes a <HI>habit of gaming</HI> every game may be reckoned a &s;tep towards inevitable ruin. They are al&s;o pernicious when the

<P>But gaming, when it is made the bu&s;ine&s;s of life, is pernicious in every re&s;pect. Ruin and reproach are the portion of that unhappy female who is prone to a vice &s;o incon&s;i&s;tent with the delicacy of the &s;ex.

<P>I called one day at Mr.&mdash;'s a gentleman of my acquaintance, where I had promi&s;ed my&s;elf an agreea|ble afternoon; but finding my friend was gone out, I re&s;olved to entertain my&s;elf as well as I could. Accor|dingly, being invited by the lovely &s;ong&s;ters, and prompted by a natural curio&s;ity, I took a walk into the fields; and, intent upon great nature's works, carele&s;sly &s;auntered about, till I was quite lo&s;t among the inex|tricable mazes of mountains, lawns, and meadows. The &s;un had &s;et, and the &s;ables of night were covering the earth; when I found my&s;elf alone in a &s;eque&s;tered vale. From whence I had come, or whither to go, I knew not. In this bewildered condition, I came to an high mountain, and &s;at down under a large tree; that the boughs might &s;helter me from the damps of night. The winds cea&s;ed, and a &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rene calm en&s;ued. I reclined my head again&s;t my favorite tree, and was ju&s;t clo&s;ing my eyes in &s;leep; when I was &s;tartled from the ground by the broken accents of grief. At fir&s;t, I imagined it to

be the love lorn turtle, who was co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing her plaintive ditty: but the repeated &s;ighs, joined with almo&s;t articu|late &s;ounds, &s;oon convinced me of my mi&s;take. The a&s;cent of the mountain, that the &s;ound came from, was exceeding &s;teep, and appeared to be in&s;uperable; yet nature, at the voice of human di&s;tre&s;s, irri&s;i&s;tably urged me to offer relief. With much difficulty, and at the expence of much time, I climbed up the precipice; and guided by the mournful &s;ound, I came to a cave where the object of pity was. The morning light by this time favoring me, I had a clear view: A young woman of &s;urpa&s;&s;ing beauty, was &s;itting on the ground within the mouth of the cave: her di&s;hevelled hair hung neglected down her neck, and her langui&s;hing head reclined on her &s;houlder; while &s;he was pouring forth her moans to the empty winds. For a few minutes I &s;tood &s;ur|pri&s;ed at the piteous &s;ight; then, moved with an humane pa&s;&s;ion and kind &s;ympathy, I &s;tepped to the cave, and took her by the hand to rai&s;e her up, till then &s;he took no notice; but feeling my hand, &s;he looked up and thus &s;poke: "Ah! depart, and leave me, the mo&s;t wretched of my &s;ex." If your misfortunes, &s;aid I, are great, as this your condition, is mi&s;erable, and you have no &s;ympathi&s;ing friend to bear the burden with you, thou art wretched indeed "Friend!" &s;he replied, "&s;ympa|thi&s;ing friend! O Artamenes! had not I injured thee, I &s;hould now po&s;&s;e&s;s a warm and generous friend." Per|ceiving that &s;he was oppre&s;&s;ed with a load of &s;orrow, I begged to be informed of the cau&s;e; and made every proffer of a&s;&s;i&s;tance. "Kind &s;tranger," &s;he replied,

"your curio&s;ity is laudable, and your offers generous; the former, if it will afford you any &s;atisfaction, I am willing to gratify; but the latter, thro a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of my own unworthine&s;s, I am re&s;olved never to accept.

It was not long before a train of flatterers, as I thought them, paid me their compliments; but with a kind of plea&s;ing vanity I treated all with di&s;dain; and took a &s;ecret &s;atisfaction in finding that the more I &s;lighted, &s;till the more I had to engage.

di&s;appointment. Thus I was fixed on a new &s;trata|gem. The next day he returned, according to his de|&s;ire, and renewed the attack with the greate&s;t civility and warme&s;t per&s;ua&s;ion. But like the mon&s;ter guilt my tongue &s;aid no, when my heart and coun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">enance gave it the lie. This undoing folly, O tyrant cu&s;tom, ha&s;t thou introduced to our &s;ex, and blanched it over with the &s;mooth name of mode&s;ty! He remained con|&s;tant to his purpo&s;e, and often renewed his reque&s;t. In|deed I admired his per&s;on, and was charmed with his &s;en&s;ibility; yet had the folly, incident to my &s;ex, whil&s;t I was in his pre&s;ence to banter his pa&s;&s;ion and ridicule the &s;incere&s;t profe&s;&s;ions of his love: but no &s;ooner could he leave me, than I pined with the &s;ame vehe|mence of pa&s;&s;ion, and wi&s;hed for an opportunity to di&s;clo&s;e it. At length being wearied with ungenerous treatment, and de&s;pair of &s;ucce&s;s, he made this la&s;t re|&s;olve: (ah, too fatal re&s;olution!) "Tho thou art dearer than life; tho death &s;hould &s;ooner &s;eparate me from the world, than aught from thy arms; yet, &s;ince my mi&s;ery is &s;o nearly blended with thine, I cannot de&s;ire to be &s;o wretchedly happy, as thereby to make you mi&s;erable; as you intimate, if ever a union betwixt us &s;hould en|&s;ue: therefore, I fly thy pre&s;ence, having this comfort only, that I may feed on thy &s;weet remembrance, which is &s;o deeply fixed in my brea&s;t, that not life, nor death can era&s;e it."</P>
<P>"This he &s;poke with &s;o much tenderne&s;s, and yet re&s;olution that I was at a lo&s;s what to do: and whil&s;t I was con&s;idering whether fal&s;e named mode&s;ty, or open &s;incerity &s;hould guide my way, he took his la&s;t farewell.

Still I had the vanity to think that he would break <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> his re&s;olution and return; when I intended, to have thrown off the ma&s;k, and made my&s;elf happy in his arms. But I was &s;oon informed that he took leave of his friends, and told them that he &s;hould never return. It is impo&s;&s;ible for you to conceive of my di&s;tre&s;s and anxiety: a thou&s;and ideas, and a thou&s;and &s;tratagems continually pa&s;&s;ed thro my mind. My &s;pirits &s;unk, and I pined away in grief and &s;orrow. And altho the &s;lighte&s;t occurrence would rai&s;e my expectation, yet they were all ideal and momentary. My parents no &s;ooner &s;aw me di&s;ordered, than with the kinde&s;t concern they u&s;ed all means for recovering my health. Phy&s;icians far and near were con&s;ulted, but to no purpo&s;e; for be|ing ignorant of the cau&s;e, the cure was beyond their reach. I continued in this &s;tate for a con&s;iderable time, avoiding all company as much as po&s;&s;ible. But as I was &s;itting alone one evening in my chamber, having &s;ecur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d my&s;elf from interruption by locking my door, I fell into a drow&s;e. My fancy, ever bu&s;y at &s;uch times now placed me in the mid&s;t of a large and populous city.

I &s;poke to a per&s;on, who was &s;tanding by, and a&s;ked the cau&s;e of the tumult. He replied, that life, or liberty, mu&s;t now be re&s;igned. Ju&s;t as he &s;poke, I e&s;pied thro the crowd the long wi&s;hed for Artamenes. The ro&s;e blu&s;hed on his cheek and the &s;erenity of the morn|ing &s;at upon his countenance; length of time had added new elegance to his form, and melting love, mingled with cheerful innocence &s;parkled in his eye. Tran&s;|ported

beyond expre&s;&s;ion, I was ju&s;t leaping to embrace the object of my love&mdash;but ere I could reach his lovely arms; (Oh horrid to relate! let flowing tears buy off the mournful tale) ere I could ta&s;te the &s;weetne&s;s of his lips; the cruel &s;oldiers di&s;charged the winged fate.

<P>Here &s;he was &s;o affected, that her power of &s;peech was &s;u&s;pended for a con&s;iderable time; but at length &s;he thus continued.</P>
<P>"I &s;tartled in wild amaze from my &s;leep, raved with &s;taring horror; and, then &s;wooned with over|whelming grief. When I had recovered again my en|feebled &s;trength, I thus &s;poke with my&s;elf; O Artame|nes! if my dream be true, how changed! a pale, lifele&s;s corp&s;e! trampled with the common earth under foot! &s;acrifice to &s;avage lu&s;t! and the &s;econd victim at liber|ty's &s;hrine!

I will &s;eek &s;ome lonely cavern where I may forever mourn his unhappy fate. The next day at evening I had the &s;orrowful news of his murder from a per&s;on who was pre&s;ent at the ma&s;&s;acre.

Unknowing, and un|known, I wandered about; till I chanced to light upon this cave.

<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible for any per&s;on to imagine, or me to expre&s;s, the grief and &s;ympathy that agitated my brea&s;t, whil&s;t &s;he was relating her &s;tory.

<P>I came down from the mountain, and with &s;ome difficulty found the way back to my friend's hou&s;e. After the u&s;ual compliments, and a tran&s;ient conver&s;a|tion were pa&s;&s;ed; being very much fatigued with what had happened, I retired to an apartment, and &s;lept till

<HEAD>THE HAPPY DELIVERANCE.</HEAD>
<P>IN one of tho&s;e ages when de&s;poti&s;m was the engine of re&s;entment, of pa&s;&s;ion, of civil fury, and po|litical rage, Alphon&s;o, the &s;on of Ferdinand, king of Arragon, lived. This young prince was di&s;tingui&s;hed not more by the robu&s;t valor of the times, than by the gentle and generous qualities of the heart, which are thought to belong more properly to modern manners. The &s;on of a cruel and ruthle&s;s tyrant, he was mild, hu|mane, and forbearing; the flattery of courtiers was heard by him with indifference, and to the fawning of &s;ycophants he was ever aver&s;e. He led a retired life even in the bu&s;tle of a court, and devoted his hours to love and the Mu&s;es. The object of his pa&s;&s;ion was the daughter of his father's trea&s;urer Orlando&mdash;her name I&s;abella&mdash;a virgin univer&s;ally admired for her extreme beauty, and the lovely qualities of her mind. She was not in&s;en&s;ible to the pa&s;&s;ion of Alphon&s;o, but whether from dread of Ferdinand, who &s;he was convinced had too much pride to allow his &s;on to marry the daughter of one whom he had rai&s;ed from ob&s;curity&mdash;or whether Orlando had forbid her interviews with the young prince, &s;he avoided meeting with the prince, who could not but venerate her prudence while he lamented the unhappy cau&s;e.</P>
<P>Ferdinand about this time &s;ent for his &s;on, and in|formed him of a march he had prepared for him, and
<PB N="110" REF="032707_0109_0FF42ABF2B2428B0">
which he had ordered him in&s;tantly to accept, forbid|ing him on pain of his di&s;plea&s;ure to offer any argument again&s;t it. Alphon&s;o was not more alarmed at this in|formation than a&s;toni&s;hed at the injunctions which accompanied it. "Surely," though he, "my father &s;u&s;pects my pa&s;&s;ion for I&s;abella, el&s;e why imagine that I was about to refu&s;e his offer." Ferdinand, however, mo&s;t ab&s;olute in all his commands, immediately gave orders to prepare the &s;olemnities u&s;ual on the marriage of the king's &s;on. Alphon&s;o had no alternative&mdash;He flew to I&s;abella&mdash;and by &s;tealth got into her apart|ment, notwith&s;tanding every precaution her father had u&s;ed to prevent their meeting.&mdash;Fatal was that interview; he was di&s;covered entering I&s;abella's apart|ment, and betrayed to his father by a dome&s;tic. Ferdi|nand, enraged beyond de&s;cription, &s;ent for Orlando, and reproaching him for encouraging an illicit connec|tion between his &s;on and I&s;abella, ordered him in&s;tantly to be beheaded; the cruel &s;entence was no &s;ooner exe|cuted than the king &s;ent &s;ome tru&s;ty &s;ervant to &s;eize I&s;abella and remove her to a &s;ecret place of confine|ment on the borders of his dominions, and command|ed her to be treated with every po&s;&s;ible &s;everity, and that every precaution &s;hould be taken to prevent her e&s;cape. The minions of tyrants are frequently &s;acrifices to their own treachery; when tho&s;e &s;ervants returned to inform him that his orders were obeyed, he put every one of them to death, le&s;t they might betray the &s;ecret of I&s;abella's impri&s;onment.</P>
<P>Mean time Alphon&s;o, in the height of his de&s;pair, a th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">u&s;and times meditated his own de&s;truction; but

fortitude and re&s;ignation &s;ugge&s;ting to him that he ought to live to redre&s;s the wrongs of I&s;abella, he became in|&s;pired with the romantic hope; and that he might no longer be &s;ubject to his father's tyranny, &s;uddenly di&s;|appeared on the very morning appointed for his <HI>de|te&s;ted</HI> nuptials, as he now more than ever accounted them.&mdash;Me&s;&s;engers were &s;ent into every part of the kingdom to &s;eck for him, but in vain.&mdash;Ferdinand's fury became &s;o great as to end in madne&s;s, a di&s;order rendered &s;till &s;tronger by the recollection of his many cruelties and murders; and in a few days he died, call|ing upon his &s;on to come and forgive him. The news of his death &s;oon &s;pread over the kingdom; and Al|phon&s;o, who had hid him&s;elf at no great di&s;tance from the city, returned and was proclaimed king; the fir&s;t act of his power was to di&s;mi&s;s tho&s;e men who had been the agents of his father's tyranny, and redre&s;s the grievances of tho&s;e &s;ubjects who had &s;uffered by their oppre&s;&s;ion. His virtues had long been the theme of popular applau&s;e, and the whole kingdom reechoed "Long live Alphon&s;o!"</P>
<P>To Alphon&s;o, however, the&s;e proofs of loyalty af|forded little relief. The remembrance of I&s;abella's wrongs, nothing could efface. His imagination repre&s;ented her as in mi&s;ery and di&s;tre&s;s, and his dreams were filled with horrible apparitions of her &s;orrows. Every means he had hitherto u&s;ed to find out the place of her confinement were in vain. Such precautions were taken by Ferdinand that this might for ever have remained a &s;ecret had not accident di&s;covered it.</P>
<P><PB N="112" REF="032707_0111_0FF4332A32E5CCE8">To divert Alphon&s;o's mind the griefs of which had a vi&s;ible effect on his per&s;on, his courtiers recommend|ed him to vi&s;it his kingdom throughout. Alphon&s;o, indifferent whether to live or die, carele&s;s of him&s;elf and dead to plea&s;ure, agreed however, to their propo|&s;al. One day when he was riding near the frontiers of his kingdom with only one attendant, he mi&s;&s;ed his way, and in endeavoring to recover it, had to go through a wood; the evening approached, and he had no hopes of being able to join the body of his guards at the village where he had left them. In this dilemma, he came up to an old tower, the greater part of which was in ruins; the only habitable part was a pri&s;on, but apparently in decay. Alighting from his hor&s;e he entered the horrible place, and ordered his attendant to tell the per&s;ons in the pri&s;on, that he was a benighted traveller, and begged &s;helter until morning, The keep|er received him courteou&s;ly, and even &s;atisfied his cu|rio&s;ity as to the nature of the place, and, ignorant of the late king's death, informed him tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> it was a &s;tate pri&s;on, where criminals that had rendered them&s;elves obnoxious to the king, were confined for life, but that at pre&s;ent there was only one lady in it.

Of that the keeper told him he was perfectly ignorant; the per&s;ons who brought her never having informed him, nor returned them&s;elves; but that his orders were &s;he &s;hould be kept in chains, and every po&s;&s;ibility of e&s;cape provid|ed again&s;t.

<P>HAMET the &s;on of Morat was de&s;cended from the ancient princes of Per&s;ia: led by the fame of Cha Abbas, he re&s;orted to his court and was treated with all tho&s;e marks of di&s;tinction which he could expect from &s;o generous a monarch.</P>
<P>He had a fine hou&s;e and gardens allotted him in the city of I&s;pahan with a numerous retinue, and an ample revenue to maintain them. His table was loaded with all the luxuries of the ea&s;t, his &s;eraglio was filled with the mo&s;t beautiful women in the world, He was high in favour with the Per&s;ian Monarch, and &s;eemed to po&s;|&s;e&s;s every thing that could contribute to en&s;ure human felicity.</P>
<P>Yet there was a &s;trange void in his heart, a &s;ort of
<PB N="114" REF="032707_0113_0FF4332F2260C030">
cha&s;m which to him was the &s;ource of perpetual unea|&s;ine&s;s.&mdash;The ri&s;ing day beheld him a prey to cares, and the &s;hades of night brought him no repo&s;e.</P>
<P>One day as he was wandering abroad alone, full of anxious thoughts, he came to a little &s;pot of ground where he found a &s;hepherd who was reclining on a green bank warbling out a plea&s;ant air, while his flock was feeding be&s;ide him; every now and then he ca&s;t a look towards a &s;mall cottage at a little di&s;tance, then cea&s;ing his melody would ca&s;t up a grateful look to heaven as full of thankfulne&s;s for its benefits.</P>
<P>Hamet had approached as yet un&s;een, and as there was &s;omething in the pea&s;ant <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hat attracted his notice, he &s;tood for a while ob&s;erving him. At length di&s;cov|ering him "&s;hepherd, &s;aid he, thou appeare&s;t delighted with thy occupation, and by thy countenance thy heart &s;eems to be unacquainted with trouble." It is &s;o indeed, illu&s;trious &s;tranger, returned the &s;hepherd, my occupation an&s;wers all my wants and is well &s;uited to my inclination; but I have be&s;ides yet other &s;ources of happine&s;s.&mdash;Then thou art happy? exclaimed Ha|met, but what are the&s;e &s;ources of felicity, and where|fore do&s;t thou regard that cottage with &s;uch &s;atisfaction, and lift up thy eyes to heaven as in prayer or rather in thank&s;giving." &mdash;"My &s;ources of happine&s;s my lord, an&s;wered the &s;hepherd, are in a woman whom I tenderly love, and a faithful friend who regards me as him&s;elf.&mdash;That cottage &s;uffices to contain us all, and I am for ever pouring out my thanks to heaven that has pre&s;erved them to me, and thus has made me hap|py."</P>
<P><PB N="115" REF="032707_0114_0FF42AEC15FC1128">This &s;peech touched the very &s;ource of Hamet's an|xiety: "Alas he cried, I have an hundred &s;laves and concubines, and friends without number, and yet I am unhappy!"</P>
<P>So &s;aying he left the &s;hepherd, and advanced on his walk buried in meditation till the hour of noon, when the weather which he had before little attended to, grew &s;uddenly very boi&s;terous.&mdash;A cloudy curtain veiled the &s;kies, the fighting winds ru&s;hed forth, loud thunders roared and lightning fla&s;hed around him, &mdash;A deluge of rain poured down while the very ground &s;eemed to &s;hake beneath him.</P>
<P>Driven by their tempe&s;ts, he ha&s;ted to &s;eek &s;helter in a wood, who&s;e thicke&s;t branches however were not &s;ufficient to repel its force.

When he arrived, a venerable man opened the door to him, who&s;e hair and beard were &s;ilvered over by age, it was the hermit Ha&s;&s;an, who kindly invited him to take refuge from the &s;torm while it la&s;ted. Perceiving the anxiety that dwelt on the bow of his gue&s;t, he inquired the cau&s;e of his un|ea&s;ine&s;s&mdash;Hamet concealed nothing of it from him, as far as he knew him&s;elf;&mdash;When he came to &s;peak of the &s;hepherd's happine&s;s and compare it with his own &s;ituation, "what &s;aid Ha&s;&s;an, do&s;t thou &s;ay, thou ha&s;t an hundred &s;laves, concubines and friends with|out number&mdash;ah! deluded wretch, thou ha&s;t no love, no friend, thy luxury indeed has provided thee with a

<P>The &s;on of Morat withdrew, when the tempe&s;t was over, fully determined to follow the advice of the hermit, he went home and changed his attire for plain cloathing and di&s;gui&s;ed his face as much as po&s;&s;ible; then having concealed a quantity of rich jewels in his garment, he &s;at out on a journey to Cachemire.

<P>In this country we are born to inherit an equal proportion of our parents' fortune at their decea&s;e, pro|vided our conduct does not render us unworthy their care: by this means a large e&s;tate is &s;ubject to being di|vided into many hands; thence the ba&s;is of equality and the incitement to indu&s;try and caution: and the exam|ple of frugality may operate with the &s;ame if not &s;uperi|or force, in pre&s;erving the re&s;pectability of families in this country, as the pernicious cu&s;tom of inheritance, which the laws have e&s;tabli&s;hed in &s;ome parts of Eu|rope, are capable of doing. But even the milde&s;t laws, and cu&s;toms the mo&s;t generous and well founded, will not alone in&s;ure and maintain re&s;pectability. Virtue and good morality are nece&s;&s;ary.

the object who warmed her youthful heart. Tho it di&s;covers little firmne&s;s and &s;ome caprice, yet it can be ea&s;ily conceived of.

&s;he determined to be the friend of Philander; a mutual confidence &s;oon took place, and from friend&s;hip, which grew up with them, re&s;ulted the pure&s;t love.

He vi&s;ited the gardens of plea&s;ure without lo&s;ing him&s;elf in their labyrinths, and paid his devoir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> at the &s;hrine of beauty without being fa&s;cinated by her charms. Frank was no &s;tranger at Bath, Bri&s;tol, Scar|borough, and Brighthelm&s;tone; and he began to &s;hat|ter him&s;elf that he had gained &s;o much wi&s;dom by experience, that it would be almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible for him to be deceived, even by the mo&s;t artful.</P>
<P>His prudence was &s;oon put to the trial. Pa&s;&s;ing in a &s;tage-coach from London to York, he was &s;truck with the &s;ight of a young lady, whom he con&s;idered as the mo&s;t beautiful of her &s;ex. She appeared mode&s;t even to a fault, and gave the mo&s;t prudent an&s;wer to the que&s;tions &s;he was a&s;ked by any of the pa&s;&s;engers.

One evening, as Frank was walking with the object of his wi&s;hes, he accidentally met a gentleman, who had been a very particular acquaintance of his father. Surpri&s;ed to &s;ee him in that part of the world, without having received the favour of a vi&s;it, he com|plained in a friendly manner of &s;uch unmerited neglect, and begged the favour of his company the next day to dinner. Frank, promi&s;ed to attend him, and after mutual compliments they parted. Delia &s;eemed con|founded at the pre&s;ence of this gentleman, whom we &s;hall call Horatio; and, during the conference, kept her eyes fixed upon the ground. Her lover imputed her behaviour entirely to mode&s;ty, and the incident &s;eemed rather to increa&s;e, than le&s;&s;en the e&s;teem he had conceiv|ed for her. But Delia's confu&s;ion aro&s;e from a very dif|ferent motive: She was no &s;tranger to the face of Horatio, and u&s;ed every artifice in her power to pre|vent Frank from performing the promi&s;e he had made to his friend.

<P>'I wi&s;h, for the &s;ake of our common friend&s;hip, and that harmony which has always &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between our families,' replied Horatio, with &s;ome vivacity, 'that I could approve your choice. I would willingly con|gratulate your on the pro&s;pect of your approaching happine&s;s with all the ardour of a friend.

<P>Frank readily con&s;ented, and it was agreed that the vi&s;it &s;hould be paid in the morning.

<HEAD>THE <HI>PARADISE</HI> OF <HI>SCHEDAD:</HI> AN EASTERN TALE.</HEAD>
<P>A LONG time before the prophet of true be|lievers had enlightened the world, and the holy Alco|ran had de&s;cended from the &s;eventh heaven, Schedad reigned in Yemen, with ab&s;olute power, which he u&s;ed without moderation. He was a voluptuous, an extrav|agant, and an impious tyrant: He was a mon&s;ter rather than a man, and he had the ambition of being a god. If he had wi&s;hed to be &s;o only in his court, they &s;ay the courtiers of the&s;e times would have adored without &s;cru|ple, him&s;elf, his monkey, and his paroquet: But Sche|dad was de&s;irous that all his &s;ubjects &s;hould recognize his pretended divinity, and that they &s;eriou&s;ly and in good faith &s;hould believe in it.</P>
<P>To &s;ucceed in this project, he conceived a &s;cheme, which to him appeared infallible. He made a circular
<PB N="132" REF="032707_0131_0FF43348DC9638D8">
wall, of prodigious height and extent, built in the mo&s;t beautiful &s;pot of Yemen. This wall was bordered on the in&s;ide with a fore&s;t of pine trees, which &s;erved as a belt or crown to the greate&s;t and m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;t magnificent gar|den one can po&s;&s;ibly imagine. There were meadows adorned with all the flowers of the &s;pring, and orchards which promi&s;ed all the riches of autumn. There were rivulets which glided in &s;ilence over golden &s;ands; or which ru&s;hing rapidly over a bed of pearls, mixed their murmurs with the warbling of the birds On one &s;ide, a per&s;on might admire him&s;elf in a &s;ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l like, where fi&s;h of all kind and colours were &s;port<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ng: On the other, one might de&s;cend into a delicious valley, who&s;e fre&s;hne&s;s is pre&s;erved by a &s;heet of water which tumbles from a rock.</P>
<P>A little further on, one might walk among per|fumed arbours always green, where the &s;pikenard, the balm, and the aloes, grow at the foot of palm trees and cedarr. Nature every where &s;hows her&s;elf with all her charms; and the timid art which has unveiled her, hardly allows her&s;elf to be perceived.</P>
<P>In the center of this enchanted &s;olitude, a round hill ari&s;es with a gentle &s;lope; then growing flat at once, forms on the &s;ummit a va&s;t e&s;planade. There Schedad con&s;tructed a &s;uperb palace, which he furn|i&s;hed with equal elegance and magnificence.</P>
<P>Here the pomp of luxury was found joined with the acquirements of affeminacy, and the immen&s;e ap|paratus of little conveniencies. And one might there find the arti&s;ts of plea&s;ure, cooks, mu&s;icians, dancers,
<PB N="133" REF="032707_0132_0FF4336AEBF12158">
buffoons, and even poets. Schedad thought little of the&s;e la&s;t; but what he prized above all the re&s;t was a numerous &s;warm of young girls, whom he took care to &s;catter over the palace and the gardens.&mdash;They were beautiful as the heavenly <HI>houris</HI> &s;omewhat le&s;s pure, but much more lively and &s;prightly.</P>
<P>When every thing was ready for the execution of his de&s;ign, Schedad was in ha&s;te to publi&s;h this &s;trange edict, which was affixed on all the tem|ples.</P>
<P>"Schedad, the god of Yemen, to our faithful adorers, &s;ends health and happine&s;s. As we intend to &s;urpa&s;s in liberality all other gods, who only promi&s;e happine&s;s after death, we make it known unto you, that we have created in the plain of Iram a paradi&s;e where you &s;hall enjoy all the plea&s;ures of this life.

<P>Should you wi&s;h to know who were the&s;e ble&s;|&s;ed &s;ervants of Schedad? Some of the mo&s;t impudent flatterers; &s;ome mini&s;ters of his oppre&s;&s;ion and of his debaucheries; &s;ome de&s;picable women who had yielded to his de&s;ires; &s;ome others more artful who
<PB N="134" REF="032707_0133_0FF4334C861D1040">
only promi&s;ed to repair there, and the&s;e were be&s;t treated in this promotion. Scarcely was this edict publi&s;hed, when Schedad kept his word with the new &s;aints. He conducted them with great &s;olemnity to the palace of <HI>Iram,</HI> where he left them, de&s;iring them to enjoy in peace the happine&s;s he had prepared for them, which his frequent vi&s;its &s;hould render more perfect.&mdash;He him&s;elf in going out &s;hut the gate of the &s;acred inclo&s;ure, with an order to the &s;oldiers who guarded it without, to kill without mercy all the pro|fane who &s;hould dare to approach it.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the ble&s;&s;ed gave them&s;elves up without re&s;erve to the raptures into which the view alone of their new habitation had thrown them. For the fir&s;t time in their life they admired, nay almo&s;t loved, the tyrant of Yemen. They even believed, as if he had been pre&s;ent, that the author of &s;o many delights could be only a god. But their faith was of no longer duration than their happine&s;s, which was indeed extremely &s;hort. Plea&s;ures varied in appear|ance, but which at bottom were eternally the &s;ame; plea&s;ures ea&s;y to be procured, con&s;tant, and immode|rate; &s;oon became in&s;ipid employments or hateful drudgery. By being obliged to enjoy them, they had no longer reli&s;h for hem; they perceived, on the other hand, that di&s;gu&s;t and di&s;quiet paid little re&s;pect to the paradi&s;e of Schedad, and that di&s;ea&s;es without intermi&s;&s;ion paid &s;till le&s;s. This was not all. The ble&s;&s;ed had been a little acquainted in the world, and did not like each other; but on &s;eeing one another nearer, they became better acquainted, and mutually
<PB N="135" REF="032707_0134_0FF4336D7A2CBEF8">
dete&s;ted each other. From that time, no more &s;ociety, no more conver&s;ation. Shut up in their apartment, or di&s;per&s;ed over the terraces of the palace, they looked with &s;orrow on the delicious gardens which &s;urround|ed them; They only &s;aw there the verdure of their pri&s;on. Their eyes were more willingly fixed on the red &s;ea, and on a chain of mountains they perceived at a di&s;tance. What would they not have given to wan|der at liberty through the&s;e frightful rocks, or to &s;ail on that &s;ea, di&s;credited by &s;o many &s;hip|wrecks.</P>
<P>In this &s;ituation were the ble&s;&s;ed when the god of Yemen honored them with his fir&s;t vi&s;it. He came to add the &s;upreme good of his pre&s;ence to the plea&s;ures with which he believed them enchanted. But who can figure his &s;urpri&s;e and indignation when he &s;aw &s;orrow painted on every countenance: And when in place of hymns and &s;ongs, he heard only complaints and murmurs! he di&s;&s;embled, however, and contained him&s;elf as much as po&s;&s;ible! He joined care&s;&s;es to re|proaches; and by threatening and cajolling his &s;aints, he made them promi&s;e that they would endeavour to accu&s;tom them&s;elves to paradi&s;e, and to enjoy their good fortune with patience. But this extorted prom|i&s;e hardly removed his fears. He tru&s;ted more to an order he left with the guards of the outer wall; which was to put to death no longer the profane, but the &s;aints them&s;elves, if they attempted to &s;cale the wall.</P>
<P>In &s;pite of all the&s;e precautions, Schedad returned to his capital with the mo&s;t lively inquietude, which
<PB N="136" REF="032707_0135_0FF42ADFC7B557C8">
was but too well founded. He no longer flattered him&s;elf; he &s;aw that his paradi&s;e and his divinity would tumble together into &s;uch di&s;credit as never more to rai&s;e them&s;elves. To parry this fatal &s;troke, he had recour&s;e to the only expedient which remain|ed. He proclaimed, by a &s;econd edict, that &s;eeing the ingratitude of his people, and their little eagerne&s;s to de&s;erve paradi&s;e, he was about to create a hell, where unbelievers and impious per&s;ons &s;hould no longer mock him. As it is more ea&s;y to torment men than to make them happy, the new project would probably have &s;ucceeded better than the other: But they did not leave Schedad time to execute it. That cruel extravagance alarmed people of all ranks, and exhau&s;t|ed their patience. The tyrant was dethroned; and they deliberated a long time on the puni&s;hment they &s;hould inflict. At la&s;t, they could think of none more proper than to &s;hut him up in the garden of Iram with the vile wretches with whom he had peopled it, and to &s;hut the gate of that infernal paradi&s;e. There, torn with remor&s;e, and overwhelmed with affronts, the god of Yemen ought to be convinced, that there is a &s;upreme God, who confounds the projects of impiety; and who has only promi&s;ed happine&s;s to virtue.</P>

<HEAD>TWO LETTERS FROM MR. <HI>EVERARD,</HI> F.S.M. CONTAINING AN ADVENTURE, OF WHICH HE WAS AN EYE WITNESS, AT THE QUICK|SILVER MINE OF <HI>IDRA.</HI></HEAD>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="letter">
<HEAD>LETTER I.</HEAD>
<P>THE plea&s;ure I always take in writing to you wherever I am, and whatever doing, in &s;ome mea&s;ure di&s;pels my pre&s;ent unea&s;ine&s;s; and unea&s;ine&s;s cau&s;ed at once by the di&s;agreeable a&s;pect of every thing round me, and the more di&s;agreeable circum&s;tances of the Count Alberti, with whom you were once acquainted. You remember one of the gaye&s;t, mo&s;t agreeable per&s;ons at the court of Vienna; at once the example of the men, and the favorite of the fair &s;ex. I often heard you repeat his name with e&s;teem, as one of the few that did honor to the pre&s;ent age, as po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of genero&s;ity and pity in the highe&s;t degree; as one who made no other u&s;e of fortune but to alleviate the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of mankind. That gentleman, Sir, I wi&s;h I could &s;ay, is now no more; yet, too unhappily for him, he exi&s;ts, but in a &s;ituation more terrible than the mo&s;t gloomy imagination can conceive.</P>
<P>After pa&s;&s;ing thro &s;everal parts of the Alps, and having vi&s;ited Germany, I tho't I could not well return home without vi&s;iting the quick&s;ilver mines at Idra, and &s;eeing tho&s;e dreadful &s;ubterranean caverns, where thou&s;ands are condemned to re&s;ide, &s;hut out from all hopes of ever &s;eeing the chearful light of the &s;un, and
<PB N="138" REF="032707_0137_0FF42B211331B240">
obliged to toil out a mi&s;erable life under the whips of imperious ta&s;k ma&s;ters. Imagine to your&s;elf an hole in the &s;ide of a mountain, of about five yards over; down this you are let, in a kind of bucket, more than an hundred fathom, the pro&s;pect growing &s;till more gloomy, yet &s;till widening as you de&s;cend.</P>
<P>At length after &s;winging in terrible &s;u&s;pen&s;e, for &s;ome time, in this precarious &s;tation, you reach the bot|tom, and tread on the ground, which, by its hollow &s;ound under your feet, and the reverberations of the echo, &s;eems thundering at every &s;tep you take. In this gloomy and frightful &s;olitude, you are enlightened by the feeble gleam of lamps, here and there di&s;po&s;ed, &s;o as that the wretched inhabitants of the&s;e man&s;ions can go from one part to another without a guide. And yet, let me a&s;&s;ure you, that tho they, by cu&s;tom, could &s;ee objects very di&s;tinctly by the&s;e lights, I could &s;carce di&s;cern, for &s;ome time, any thing not even the per&s;on who came with me to &s;how me the&s;e &s;cenes of horror.</P>
<P>From this de&s;cription, I &s;uppo&s;e, you have but a di&s;agreeable idea of the place: yet let me a&s;&s;ure you, that it is a palace, if we compare the habitation with the inhabitants. Such wretches my eyes never yet be|hold. The blackne&s;s of their vi&s;ages only &s;erves to cover an horrid palene&s;s cau&s;ed by the noxious quali|ties of the mineral they are employed in procuring. As they, in general, con&s;i&s;t of malefactors condemned for life to this ta&s;k, they are fed at the public expence; but they &s;eldom con&s;ume much provi&s;ion, as they lo&s;e their appetites in a &s;hort time; and commonly in about

two years expire, from a total contraction of all the joints of the body.</P>
<P>In this horrid man&s;ion I walked after my guide for &s;ome time, pondering on the &s;trange tyranny and avarice of mankind, when I was acco&s;ted by a voice behind me, calling me by name and enquiring after my health with the mo&s;t cordial affection. I turned and &s;aw a creature all black and hideous, who approached me and with a mo&s;t piteous accent demanding, "Ah! Mr. Everard do not you know me!" Good God, what was my &s;urpri&s;e, when, thro the veil of his wretchedne&s;s, I di&s;covered the features of my old and dear friend Alberti. I &s;lew to him with affection: and after a tear of condolence, a&s;ked how he came here? To this he replied, that hav|ing fought a duel with a general of the Au&s;trian inf<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|ty, again&s;t the emperor's command, and having left him for dead, he was obliged to fly into one of the fore&s;ts of I&s;tria, where he was &s;heltered by &s;ome banditti, who had long infe&s;ted that quarter. With the&s;e he had liv|ed for nine months, till, by a clo&s;e inve&s;titure of the place in which they were concealed and after a very ob|&s;tinate re&s;i&s;tance, in which the greater part of them were killed, he was taken and carried to Vienna, in order to be broke alive upon the wheel. However, upon arriving at the capital, he was quickly known, and &s;everal of the a&s;&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ciates of his accu&s;ation and dan|ger witne&s;&s;ing his innocence, his puni&s;hment of the rack was changed into that of perpetual confinement and labor in the mines of Idra; a &s;entence, in my opin|ion a thou&s;and times wor&s;e than death.</P>
<P>As Alberti was giving me this account a young wo|man

came up to him who at once I &s;aw to be born for better fortune; the dreadful &s;ituation of the place was not able to de&s;troy her beauty, and even in this &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ene of wretchedne&s;s, &s;he &s;eemed to have charms to grace the mo&s;t brilliant a&s;&s;embly.

With him &s;he accor|dingly de&s;cended into the&s;e man&s;ions from whence few of the living return; and with him &s;he is contented to live, forgetting the gaities of life, with him to toil, de&s;pi&s;ing the &s;plendors of opulence, and contented with the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of her own con&s;tancy.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER II.</HEAD>
<P>MY la&s;t to you was expre&s;&s;ive and perhaps too much &s;o, of the gloomy &s;ituation of my mind. I own the deplorable &s;ituation of the worthy man de&s;cri|bed in it, was enough to add double &s;everity to the hid|eous man&s;ion. At pre&s;ent, however, I have the hap|pine&s;s of informing you, that I was a &s;pectator of the mo&s;t affecting &s;cene I ever yet beheld. Nine days after I had written my la&s;t, a per&s;on came po&s;t from Vienna to the little village near the mouth of the greater &s;haft. He was &s;oon after followed by a &s;econd, and he by a third. Their fir&s;t inquiry was after the unfortunate count, and I happening to overhear the demand, gave them the be&s;t information. Two of the&s;e were the
<PB N="141" REF="032707_0140_0FF433851B5F5EB8">
brother and cou&s;in of the lady, the third was an intimate friend and fellow &s;oldier to the count: they came with his pardon which had been procured by the general, with whom the duel had been fought, and who had perfectly recovered from his wounds. I led them with all the expedition of joy down to his dreary abode, and pre&s;ented to him his friends, and informed him of the happy change in his circum&s;tances. It would be impo&s;&s;ible to de&s;cribe the joy that brightened upon his grief&mdash;worn countenance; nor was the young lady's emotion le&s;s vivid at &s;eeing her friends and hearing of her hu&s;bands freedom. Some hours were employed in mending the appearance of this faithful couple, nor could I without a tear behold him taking leave of the formers wretched companions of his toil. To one he left his mattock, to another his working cloths, to a third his little hou&s;hold uten&s;ils, &s;uch as were nece&s;&s;ary for him in that &s;ituation. We &s;oon emerged from the mine, where he once again revi&s;ited the light of the &s;un, that he had totally de&s;paired of every &s;eeing. A po&s;t chai&s;e and four were ready the next morning to take them to Vienna, where I am &s;ince informed by a letter from him&s;elf, they are returned. The empre&s;s has again taken him into favour; his fortune and rank are re&s;tored; and he and his fair partner now have the plea&s;ing &s;atisfaction of feeling happine&s;s with double reli&s;h, as they once knew what it was to be mi&s;era|ble.</P>

<DIV3 TYPE="letter">
<P>YOUR letter, kind Lindor, I peru&s;ed with pe|culiar &s;atisfaction. I feel much gratified, and you have the pure&s;t acklowledgments of my heart for your inter|e&s;ting &s;tory. To merit your confidence, I &s;hall ever rank among my mo&s;t valuable acqui&s;itions; and be per&s;uaded of the warm emotions of my bo&s;om, when you inform me, that any words my lips can pronounce, are capable of abating the &s;orrows which corrode your mind. If my advice has been &s;erviceable, if it has been the means of calming the turbulence of your fruit|le&s;s burning flames, I am richly compen&s;ated by its event; my intention is thereby &s;anctioned, and by following it in this in&s;tance, I may without o&s;tentation &s;ay, you add a &s;prig of laurel to your own brow. It is not common, for two &s;exes to corre&s;pond with each other, on the &s;ub|ject you have cho&s;en. It is rather the province of ours alone. But what is uncommon, is not always vicious; if therefore, our corre&s;pondence &s;hould be con|demned by the maidens of &s;ixteen, my age of &s;ix and thirty will ju&s;tify me; add to this, our connection and early acquaintance, and I may flatter my&s;elf of being &s;e|cure from cen&s;ure. I often think on your father's anx|ity for you, and the plea&s;ure he fondly anticipated in the enjoyment of your &s;ociety, after the completion of
<PB N="143" REF="032707_0142_0FF42B229763F210">
your education, which he had determined to watch over with a parental care.</P>
<P>I well remember his grey di&s;hevelled locks, falling upon the &s;houlders, on which, he has often borne you with peculiar delight, while you remained uncon&s;cious of his devoted affection towards you. He was &s;natch|ed from this &s;cene of woes, this theatre of &s;hort lived plea&s;ures, to mount the realms of eternal bli&s;s, while yet you needed his parental precepts. His examples however have afforded you the pure&s;t model of recti|tude, and his virtues offer you a complete and worthy rule of human perfection. Follow them, my friend; and if the &s;ympathy of Caroline can at any time allevi|ate your grief, recur to her, and receive tho&s;e reflec|tions which re&s;ult from her little experience, with the &s;ame plea&s;ure &s;he takes in offering them; and be a&s;&s;ur|ed of the joy &s;he ever feels in &s;uppre&s;&s;ing the &s;orrows of thy wounded heart, and the animation it affords her, to draw upon thy blooming cheek, a gentle &s;mile.</P>
<P>While I was writing you, <HI>Charles</HI> came running in|to the parlor, to inform me of the arrival of my brother <HI>Sylvander;</HI> (who you know we heard was dead) the a&s;|&s;urance he gave me of the fact, left me no room to doubt the truth of it. He told me he had enquired for my father, and ran immediately into his chamber; luck|ily he found him &s;leeping&punc; and would not, notwith|&s;tanding his anxiety, di&s;turb him: I had been up as u&s;ual ever &s;ince five.</P>
<P>You may well judge of my joy and &s;urpri&s;e to &s;ee an only brother, who all of us had concluded to
<PB N="144" REF="032707_0143_0FF42B075141E478">
be dead nearly &s;ix years &s;ince; our conjectures of his decea&s;e were founded on va<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ious reports, which though they could never be made to corre&s;pond, yet the &s;ilence he &s;uffered to take place, &s;erved to de&s;troy on our part, the &s;malle&s;t hope of his exi&s;tence, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> doubt of his death; you may readily &s;uppo&s;e I could write no more, 'till my anxious wi&s;hes were &s;uppre&s;&s;ed or accompli&s;hed; laying my pen acro&s;s the ink&s;tand, I went and threw my&s;elf upon the &s;ofa, at the other end of the room; my mind felt agitated with a variety of thoughts on the &s;ubject of the arrival of a beloved brother, after &s;o long &s;eparation; the blood began to boil in my heart, and a certain dizzine&s;s &s;eized my head.</P>
<P>Indeed I was almo&s;t di&s;tracted, fearing it a dream; at the moment of my deepe&s;t indeci&s;ion, he came into the parlor; I made a fruitle&s;s effort to run to meet him; with difficulty I pre&s;erved my&s;elf from fainting; my &s;trength failed me, and I fell back upon the &s;ofa almo&s;t lifele&s;s; he flew and caught me in his arms, and by the help of &s;ome &s;alvolatile from my &s;melling bottle, which had dropt from my hand, I was very &s;oon recovered. Is it po&s;&s;ible, my deare&s;t &s;i&s;ter, cried he, that my pre&s;|ence can afflict? rather let it in&s;pire within your heart a lively gladne&s;s, and exhibit with mine the proof of mu|tual tran&s;port. Tho he p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ended to demon&s;trate: degree of fortitude &s;uperior to mine, I could readily perceive his feelings were not le&s;s affected. I have fre|quently heard you mention the pathetic and touching &s;cenes you have witne&s;&s;ed, on the meetings of the

<HI>French,</HI> with their friends or near connexions, after a long ab&s;ence, and the apathy of the <HI>Americans,</HI> who are, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, often in&s;en&s;ible to appearance: Their feelings on occa&s;ions like the&s;e are for the mo&s;t part concealed in their brea&s;ts, and from cu&s;tom alone, are not te&s;tified with that warmth, for which the former are &s;o ju&s;tly celebrated; the ardor of each, ri&s;es, I believe, to the &s;ame degree of pure &s;incerity; and your opinion of the <HI>Americans,</HI> would have been altered, could you have &s;een our meeting.</P>
<P>I felt extremely glad that <HI>Sylvander</HI> did not di&s;turb my father, for the &s;hock might have overcome him. We have now taken the precaution, to advi&s;e him of the plea&s;ing news of my brother's arrival, when he &s;hall awake. This will prepare his mind, for the interview, and at the &s;ame time prevent a too &s;udden effu&s;ion of joy, which might prove fatal to one in his declining years. After the mutual inquiries con&s;equent on the meeting of friends, &s;eparated from each other for &s;o long a term of years, my brother informed me that la&s;t evening he met with his "ever adored <HI>Lavina,</HI>" as he called her, which prevented his arrival in town &s;ooner; indeed he told me, he had almo&s;t determined to tarry to day wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h his charmer, and &s;end us a letter to an|nounce his arrival.

<HEAD>THE NYMPH OF THE GROVE. <HI>A Sentimental Hi&s;toriette.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE evening was beautifully &s;erene; the moon, blu&s;hing with crim&s;on hue, had ju&s;t emerged from the horizon; and I was directing my &s;teps towards an ele|vation, from whence, I promi&s;ed my&s;elf with rea&s;on, the mo&s;t delightful per&s;pective view of the fine country around.&mdash;Arrived at this &s;ummit, I was contemplating the &s;weet pro&s;pect, and dwelling with rapture upon the variety of the &s;cene. On the one &s;ide were verdant plains and flowery meads; on the other &s;ide, an orchard of trees in blo&s;&s;om, exhaling in profu&s;ive plenty the &s;weete&s;t fragrance, wafted by the gentle zephyr with fanciful delight; the ruffling of the leaves and the mur|muring &s;ound from the little brook clo&s;e by me, arre&s;ted attention with peculiar plea&s;ure; the wide extended ocean glittering in tranquil calmne&s;s, attracted thought, and the little inter&s;per&s;ed i&s;l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s, who&s;e green &s;urfaces ro&s;e in maje&s;tic beauty above the &s;hining waters, formed al&s;o a part of pen&s;ive meditation. As the day retired,
<PB N="147" REF="032707_0146_0FF42B1659C0BE30">
the &s;ilver moon advanced to replace the diurnal &s;tar, and prevent the dark canopy of night from being un|furled. I wandered from hill to hill, contemplating in tran&s;port the brilliancy of the pro&s;pect, till I had re|ally lo&s;t my&s;elf; and entering an adjacent grove, I heard the voice of a female, uttering her complaints in &s;oft accents, to the meandring brook, by the &s;ide of which &s;he had &s;eated her&s;elf on a rock. I crept &s;oftly when I perceived her, and came near to her, while &s;he was yet melodiou&s;ly continuing her tender tale, uncon&s;cious of an interruption. Pardon my intru&s;ion, &s;aid I, unknown fair, whoever thou art, and if the almighty ruler of events, &s;hall have thus directed my &s;teps to afford you relief, command the exertions of one, who will take a plea&s;ure in pre&s;enting the balm of comfort, to the fair di&s;tre&s;&s;ed. Her ebony hair was di&s;played in ringlets over her well formed neck, and divided in front, fall|ing carele&s;sly in gentle curls upon her temples. A gloom was vi&s;ible on her countenance, and &s;he appeared to behold me with very little &s;urpri&s;e. I told her the bright evening had induced me to wander till I had quite lo&s;t my way, and begged her to inform me in what direction I might walk to regain the road. She replied, with a &s;yren's voice, "yonder hou&s;e borders on it." And pray is that your dwelling? She an&s;wered in the affirmative. The tear was not dried from her lively eye, &s;parkling, tho in di&s;tre&s;s, and animating to a charm. Her cheeks &s;eemed to have been once emblems of the blooming ro&s;e, but now become almo&s;t pale; her features were regular, and her countenance di&s;played a degree of virtuous dignity, at once commanding and agreeable;

<P>"My Father was a trade&s;man in the capital. By a &s;trict application to bu&s;ine&s;s, favoured in &s;ome mea&s;ure by good fortune, and availing him&s;elf of every adven|titious circum&s;tances in trade, he acquired a very hand&s;ome e&s;tate. My mother died when I was but an infant, and the care of my education devolved con&s;equently upon my father, who never put it out of his hands, until he re&s;igned his breath!"

<P>"The attention of a father to the nece&s;&s;ary edu|cation of a daughter, is &s;ometimes to be complained of; in &s;ome degree this was unhappily my ca&s;e.

I felt obliged by their advice, though at the age of &s;eventeen, I mu&s;t confe&s;s it appeared awkward, to begin the rudiments of nece&s;|&s;ary learning. It was however, a duty I owed my&s;elf, and &s;o greatly beneficial to my future welfare, that I &s;hould have heen highly culpable to have di&s;pen&s;ed with this all important nece&s;&s;ity, and &s;hould have paid too &s;everely the price of my ignorance. My father left a will, by which his large fortune was divided between an elder brother and my&s;elf. The

idea of a fortune without control, was an attractive charm, and brought me many pretended admirers, and in &s;warms I was &s;eemingly infe&s;ted every time I made my appearance in public. My &s;ituation demanded the mo&s;t determined fortitude, and peculiar fore&s;ight, to prevent being impo&s;ed upon, being u&s;h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">red into the world, unprepared for &s;uch a change, and at an age, when the imagination is too ea&s;ily captivated by &s;oph|i&s;try and airy tales; for I mu&s;t inform you that my father utterly dete&s;ted every kind of publick amu&s;e|ment.</P>
<P>"I had an adorer, as &s;incere, methinks, as the loves can paint; a tear is due to his momory! my heart &s;wells and is ready to bur&s;t when I &s;peak of him. I have him always in my thoughts.

One who pretended to be my friend, intimated to my father that the amiable <HI>Sylvander</HI> vi&s;ited him for the &s;ake of his daughter, and was actually paying his ad|dre&s;&s;es; this was &s;ufficient to induce my father to refu&s;e <HI>Sylvander</HI> any future admi&s;&s;ion to his hou&s;e, and order me to forbid his coming. My duty obliged me to per|form the painful ta&s;k; this did not, however, by any means di&s;&s;olve my pa&s;&s;ion; on the contrary it &s;eemed rather to augment it, and I endeavored to alleviate the poignancy of his grief, by giving him every opportu|nity I was able, to be in my company; but the plot was &s;oon di&s;covered, and for my own peace and the in|clination I ever had to follow the dictates of my beloved parent, I was obliged to beg my lover never to &s;ee me more.

my acquaintance, and endeavored to obtain with my per&s;on, that part of my father's hard earnings which fell to my lot.

<HEAD><HI>KINTAIR</HI> AND <HI>SEATON</HI>; OR, THE UNFORTU|NATE SISTERS.</HEAD>
<P>IN the north we&s;t parts of Scotland, in the reign of Malcolm, and cotemporary with the u&s;urper Macbeth, who&s;e hi&s;tory our immortal Shake&s;pear has made the &s;ubject of one of his tragedies, there lived two young noblemen, at the head of two parties, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> mortal ene|mies of one another. Scarce a week pa&s;&s;ed, at tho&s;e times when the families were near one another, without accounts of rapes, of duels, and of private murthers; for the hatred was &s;o univer&s;ally &s;trong thro the whole multitude, that from the lord to the meane&s;t &s;ervant, all thought it a merit and an honor to injure, even in the mo&s;t di&s;hone&s;t manner, any body that belonged in any degree to the enemy's party.</P>
<P><PB N="159" REF="032707_0158_0FF42B8658F19EC0">The names of the two young noblemen, at this time at the head of the&s;e parties, were <HI>Seaton</HI> and <HI>Kintair</HI>; the former, a youth of a mo&s;t promi&s;ing genius and great abilities, joined to great integrity, and an earne&s;t love of virtue; his hereditary hatred to the Kintairs was, in &s;hort, the only thing that could &s;ully his character; and that he governed in &s;uch a manner, that had it not been for the temper of his enemy, the world &s;aw the family quarrel might have been made up between them, and a deal of mi&s;ery and blood&s;hed prevented to the country; but &s;uch was the implacable hatred and native cruelty of the young Kintair, that all offers of this kind in his life mu&s;t have been vain, and could only have ex|po&s;ed the goodne&s;s of the offerer to the imputations of weakne&s;s, cowardice, and fear. The violent Kintair was in his temper bloody, revengeful, pityle&s;s, and &s;avagely cruel, to a degree &s;carce to be conceived; ye all the&s;e violent pa&s;&s;ions and all his hatred to the Seaton family, could not prevent his falling in love, at fir&s;t &s;ight, with one of that hou&s;e, indeed the &s;i&s;ter, though he at fir&s;t knew it not, of the very lord he hated &s;o implacably.</P>
<P>This lady, who&s;e name was Margaret, had nor only a very charming per&s;on; but the innate virtues of her &s;oul di&s;played them&s;elves outwardly in her face&punc; and whole deportment, and gave her an air and manner not to be re&s;i&s;ted; &s;he had a twin &s;i&s;ter, &s;o like her in every feature and lineament of face, that they were not ea&s;ily to be known a&s;under, the&s;e were the only relations of the young Seaton; and, with him, made all the remain|der of that noble and antient family.</P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="032707_0159_0FF433A344431468">Opportunities of meeting, it is ea&s;y to imagine, were not very frequent between the&s;e two families, e&s;pecially between the heads of them: in &s;hort, it happened that the rough Kintair had never &s;een this lady, till one evening as &s;he was returning on hor&s;e back from a vi&s;it to a friend at &s;ome miles di&s;tance, he met her, as he was going acro&s;s the country, attended by half a dozen &s;er|vants, to a party of diver&s;ion. The moment he beheld her, he &s;topped his hor&s;e, ordered as polite a me&s;&s;age a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> he could dictate to be delivered to her, and begged h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> might have leave to &s;peak to her: the lady alighted from her hor&s;e, and readily admitted him: when he ap|proached her, he threw him&s;elf upon his knees, intreated her to tell him her condition; and, if the laws of honor would permit it, he would make her wife to the fir&s;t nobleman of the country; for that he was the lord Kintair. The lady, who had till that word heard him with a downca&s;t look, and a face covered with a blu&s;h of mode&s;ty, now immediatly leaped on her hor&s;e again, and told him; young lord, one word will an&s;wer you; my name is Maraget Seaton. And, thus &s;aying, &s;he pur&s;ued her journey.</P>
<P>Words are too faint to de&s;cribe the conflict of raging pa&s;&s;ions in the brea&s;t of the wild Kintair, on this occa&s;ion; love, anger, pride, revenge, the lo&s;t hopes of enjoyment of the lady, and the di&s;dain of a refu&s;al, all combating together in his brea&s;t, left him no room at fir&s;t for words, or for any re&s;olution: he thew him&s;elf on the ground, and tore up the very earth in agony: at length, ari&s;ing in a fury, he bade his &s;ervants follow, and bring her and her attendants back to him:

they were not got far, however, before he changed his opinion; and, thinking of the uncertainty of their &s;uc|ce&s;s, as the lady's attendants were equal to them in num|ber, and determining to tru&s;t his revenge to nobody but him&s;elf, he mounted his hor&s;e and followed them.</P>
<P>Love and revenge gave him wings; he &s;oon over|took his own &s;ervants, and, quickly after, the lady Margaret and hers: he rode up to her, and addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to her a &s;econd time in the&s;e words: In&s;olent ideot, did you imagine you could e&s;cape me thus, and that I would let you go home to make your brother &s;port with my entreaties, and your proud refu&s;al? no! think not that I would marry the &s;i&s;ter of a man I hate; or be the &s;candalous means, by a boyi&s;h pa&s;&s;ion, of making up an enmity, which has &s;o ju&s;t a cau&s;e as that between our families; and which I hope, will be eter|nal. There is a &s;horter way for me to &s;atiate my de|&s;ires; one that gives me too a double plea&s;ure; as it &s;eeds at once my hatred and my love, and gives me the noble&s;t revenge on all your hou&s;e, that my hate can even wi&s;h: with the&s;e words, he gave the &s;ignal of mur|ther to his attendants, who de&s;troyed all the unhappy lady's &s;ervants, after a &s;hort conflict; during which, the inhuman lord ravi&s;hed their mi&s;erable mi&s;tre&s;s.

and wandered to weep her &s;orrows at the fatal place where the horrid act had been committed; &s;he was here to&s;&s;ing her&s;elf on the ground, and making the rocks and woods re&s;ound with her di&s;tracted cries, when the mur|therers approached with their unhappy prey; the trampling of hor&s;es, the oaths and bla&s;phemies of the company, and the known voice of the hated Kintair ter|rified the unfortunate lady Margaret &s;o, that &s;he crept among bu&s;hes and thorns which wounded her tender &s;kin as &s;he pa&s;&s;ed on at every &s;tep, till &s;he came to a thicket, behind which &s;he re&s;ted to li&s;ten to the noi&s;e of the&s;e abandoned ruffians.

Immediately all &s;eparated to the work; and the afflicted lady Margaret took that opportunity to get back to her cottage; &s;he was &s;carce there when the whole country was rai&s;ed; the bloody Kintair joined the mob; and Farquar&s;on, when they came in &s;ight, fled, as he was ordered, before them; Kintair pur&s;ued him, with a number of the clowns; and when he was got from them, that mon&s;ter of villainy returned, a&s;&s;ured, and per&s;uaded his followers, that it was lord Seaton who &s;led before them. The clowns, willing to &s;how their di&s;cernment, agreed to a man, that they knew him all the way he went, and knew the hor&s;e he rode on; and on now viewing the bodies of the murthered per&s;ons, the abandoned Kintair per&s;uaded every body, that this Seaton had debauched his &s;i&s;ter, and brought her hither, where with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his other &s;ervants, he had murthered her, and all who were there pre&s;ent. His own people, it is ea&s;y to imagine, joined readily in this, and the re&s;t were &s;oon brought over to follow their opinion: as &s;oon as Kintair found this, he made them a long declamation on the horror of the crime, and per&s;uaded them all to follow him imme|diately to the next large town, and relate before the magi&s;tracy what they had &s;een. His per&s;ua&s;ions, and the rewards he promi&s;ed to all that would go with him, made every one pre&s;ent follow; and immediately they &s;et forward, tho in the night, and never &s;topped or &s;tay|ed till they arrived at the end of their journey.

extolled the genero&s;ity, the goodne&s;s, and love of ju&s;tice their ma&s;ter &s;howed in this; and partly by the&s;e prai&s;es, and partly by promi&s;ed reward to all that &s;hould be able to give material evidence again&s;t the murtherers, the clowns were led into forming a thou&s;and circum|&s;tances, all po&s;itive, again&s;t the pretended murtherer. When they arrived at the town, it happened that the magi&s;tracy was at that time &s;itting: they were all rejoic|ed at this, and went in a body to the hall; and, de|manding (on account of the horrid enormity of the crime they came to give evidence in) an immediate <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">u|dinence, were admitted. The arch-devil Kintair en|tering at their head, recounted to the magi&s;tracy the &s;tory he had before concerted, and &s;wore to the iden|tity of the per&s;on he accu&s;ed; his &s;ervants all follow|ed his example, and, unwilling to &s;ay &s;omething from their own knowledge, each &s;ingled out &s;ome one by name of the innocent Seaton's &s;ervants, whom they accu&s;ed of the murther of the attendants; and the clowns joining their po&s;itive oaths to the &s;ame facts, and ma|ny other forged circum&s;tances, the ab&s;ent Seaton and &s;ix of his attendants were accu&s;ed of a mo&s;t horrid murther, on the po&s;itive oaths of more than thirty per&s;ons, who all declared them&s;elves to have been eye witne&s;&s;es of the facts they alledged again&s;t them.</P>
<P>The innocent lord Seaton knew nothing of any part of this fatal tragedy, but was returning to his ca&s;tle with &s;ome of his &s;ervants, from a &s;hort journey he had taken to meet his &s;i&s;ters, when he was &s;eized by the officers of ju&s;tice &s;ent to apprehend him: all circum|&s;tances are con&s;trued into meaning by people po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed

of an opinion; and accordingly, this unhappy lord being now found returning with a number of his &s;er|vants from that part of the country where the murther had been committed, was looked on as a proof of his having been committing it; and the agonies of grief, a&s;toni&s;hment, and horror with which he received the news of the death of his beloved &s;i&s;ter, and his &s;ervants, were con&s;trued into confe&s;&s;ions of his guilt.</P>
<P>The mi&s;take of the two-&s;i&s;ters was not found out; and the po&s;itives oaths of all the accu&s;ers, that it was lady Margaret that was murthered, made it not at all doubted. The unfortunate lady was glad of the mi&s;|take, wi&s;hing, &s;ince the rape, for nothing but to be un|known to the whole world; and looking on this as the mo&s;t &s;ecure of all the means of being &s;o, would never, had &s;he not afterwards felt the then nece&s;&s;ity that com|pelled her to it, have declared her&s;elf to the world.</P>
<P>A &s;hort journey brought the accu&s;ed lord before the magi&s;tracy; he entered the room before they ex|pected him, and immediately on his appearance all the accu&s;ers renewed their oaths, that he and his attend|ants who were now with him, were the very per&s;ons who had committed the murthers; and the vile Kintair made a long harrangue to the court, aggravating in the &s;tronge&s;t manner the horror of the crime, and adding a thou&s;and reproaches. When he had done, the accu&s;ed lord advanced toward his judges with a &s;ettled coun|tenance, and looking with di&s;dain on his accu&s;er, and on his judges with that mode&s;t, but intrepid confidence, which con&s;cious innocence ever gives, &s;poke in the following manner:

<P>Is it probable that they could for my &s;ake, be in|duced to murther the&s;e; or that I, who have been known to love my &s;i&s;ter Margaret with more than a common affection, could be her murtherer?

<P>Here the accu&s;ed ended his defence, which was &s;oon overpowered by the number and repeated oaths of the evidences and particularly of his enemy Kintair, who a&s;&s;erted that he &s;aw him plunge his dagger in the brea&s;t of the lady Margaret, and &s;aw the others butch|ering her attendants. The &s;upreme judge was now ri&s;ing from his &s;eat, to pronounce &s;entence on the ac|cu&s;ed lord and his attendants, when a voice was heard crying with the utmo&s;t earne&s;tne&s;s, Forbear! forbear, oh judge guard well the doors that none e&s;cape; and at the &s;ame in&s;tant, a woman threw her&s;elf at the feet of the judges, crying out, I am that Margaret, whom this innocent this be&s;t of brothers is accu&s;ed of mur|thering;

The court all ro&s;e in a moment, a&s;toni&s;hed at her appearance; the brother threw him&s;elf on her neck in a tran&s;port of joy, and the court examining the daggers, and finding on each the name of its owner, demanded of the lady the true hi&s;tory of the fact. She on this related the whole ca|ta&s;trophe in the mo&s;t pathetic terms. And when &s;he had heard the &s;entence, intended for her brother and his &s;ervants, pa&s;&s;ed on his accu&s;ers, &s;he retired into a nunnery, and left the innocent, but unhappy Seaton in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his own, and the forfeited e&s;tate and titles of his accu&s;er; which his de&s;cendants, the Seatons of that country, enjoy to this day.</P>

Ingratitude, has, from the earlie&s;t ages, been treated with ju&s;t contempt, and
<PB N="170" REF="032707_0169_0FF433B119891818">
ince&s;&s;ant pains have been taken to publi&s;h the deed, and lay open to mankind the hated mi&s;creant, guilty of &s;o vile a &s;tain; a crime of the greate&s;t magnitude in the &s;ight of heaven, and generally regarded as heinous and contemptible by the inhabitants of this lower world.</P>
<P>I was led to the&s;e reflections, from a circum&s;tance which took place not long after the peace. It will be recollected, that at the clo&s;e of the late war, between <HI>Britain</HI> and <HI>America,</HI> the latter was as memorable for failures among its merchants, as during the conte&s;t, the &s;ucce&s;s of their trade had been remarkable. At this period the unfortunate <HI>Douxville</HI> (as I &s;hall here call him) from his exten&s;ive trade, experienced repeated &s;hocks by bankruptcies and the death of in&s;olvent debt|ors; the&s;e, added to ill &s;ucce&s;s in navigation, reduced a hand&s;ome fortune to the confines of a very &s;mall capital, all of which he could not call his own.</P>
<P><HI>Douxville,</HI> was a foreigner, of a compa&s;&s;ionate turn of mind, and a di&s;po&s;ition truly amiable. It always de|lighted him to calm the afflictions of his fellow coun|tryman, who were indigent through misfortunes. The&s;e he &s;eemed to entertain with an extreme plea|&s;ure, even from the &s;lighte&s;t recommendation. It was in the days of his pro&s;perity when mirth was the product of every moment; when affluence had cea&s;ed to afford in real enjoyment, and the exqui&s;ite refinements of plea|&s;ure had lo&s;t their verdant &s;miles, ari&s;ing from a con|&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of them, that chance pre&s;ented to his ho&s;pitalitie board his former friend <HI>Raymond,</HI> to whom <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> fortune had been illiberal in the di&s;tribution
<PB N="171" REF="032707_0170_0FF433E91B1F3CC0">
of her favours. He had contracted an intimacy with <HI>Raymond</HI> in <HI>Paris,</HI> and found his family to be rather in opulent that middling circum&s;tances. They offered him a hand&s;ome capital on his enterance into bu&s;ine&s;s; with which he purcha&s;ed goods and came to <HI>America</HI> a little before the peace; but through misfortunes on the one hand, and entering into &s;peculations he was en|tirely unacquainted with, on the other, he reduced him&s;elf to mere penury. <HI>Raymond</HI> was a young man who united to a getneel per&s;on and polite addre&s;s, the advantages of an exten&s;ive education; but de&s;titute, without a hope, when introduced to <HI>Douxville,</HI> who&s;e genero&s;ity, from di&s;intere&s;ted friend&s;hip alone, taught him to recognize the friendle&s;s object. <HI>Douxville,</HI> who&s;e ho&s;pitality was con&s;picious on every occa&s;ion, and who&s;e liberality the &s;hadow of meanne&s;s never eclip&s;ed, invited him to his hou&s;e, and made him his companion and bo&s;om friend. The impre&s;&s;ions &s;uch di&s;tingui&s;hed kindne&s;s wrought upon feelings of the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed <HI>Raymond,</HI> can be ea&s;ily conceived of. He accepted the invitation with all the a&s;&s;urances, that a mind penetrated with the extent of the obligation is capable of te&s;tifying: But it appears by the event, that this &s;entiment of gratitude was only momentary; and the&s;e outward demon&s;trations were, by no means the genuine effu&s;ions of a good heart. The time however was now arrived, when the beneficent acts of real friend&s;hip could be in &s;ome mea&s;ure re|paid; fidelity inviolable, and attachment &s;incere, were all that became nece&s;&s;ary. It was at this time <HI>Douxville,</HI> taking into &s;erious con&s;ideration his extreme rever&s;e of fortune, reflected with &s;ome &s;ecret &s;atisfaction, that
<PB N="172" REF="032707_0171_0FF42B4AEDB4BEA0">
a friend was left him, to whom he could di&s;clo&s;e without any kind of re&s;erve, the exact e&s;tate of his affairs. From the &s;tagnation of bu&s;ine&s;s in <HI>America,</HI> he found he &s;hould be totally ruined to continue, and therefore, &s;ug|ge&s;ted the plan of collecting together the feeble remains of his &s;hattered fortune, and &s;ailing for the We&s;tindies, in a ve&s;&s;el which he had, to endeavour to repair his lo&s;&s;es by a few &s;ucce&s;sful voyages in tho&s;e parts. From a mi&s;taken conception of merit, and a fal&s;e idea of friend&s;hip in the object he had &s;elected for his com|panion, he thought to place the mo&s;t implicit confi|dence in the wretch he had prevented from fami&s;hing; one whom gratitude ought to have very &s;trongly in|fluenced to &s;trict fidelity. But behold! a fatal rever&s;e. The &s;mall capital that remained in <HI>Douxville's</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion would not admit of diminution without injury to his trade; and owing &s;everal &s;ums in the We&s;tindies, though not very con&s;iderable, he thought it mo&s;t pru|dent to &s;ecure his property, in &s;uch a manner as not to have it arre&s;ted from him by &s;eizure in the ports where his bu&s;ine&s;s might lead him. To this effect, he propo&s;ed to convey the ve&s;&s;el and cargo by a bill of &s;ale to <HI>Raymond</HI>; the latter promoted the idea with all the warmth of apparent friend&s;hip, and the plan was duly carried into execution. They pur&s;ued their voyage, and arriving in the We&s;tindies, found every thing to exceed their mo&s;t &s;anguine expectations. Fortune to appearance began once more to di&s;play her lucid beams over the head of the unhappy <HI>Douxville.</HI> The cargo was di&s;po&s;ed of in the name of <HI>Raymond,</HI> and the profits afforded <HI>Douxville</HI> the plea&s;ing hopes of
<PB N="173" REF="032707_0172_0FF433ED6D9A54E8">
a &s;peedy termination with his creditors in a neighbour|ing i&s;land. The&s;e did not long remain ignorant of his being there, and improved the fir&s;t opportunity to &s;end and arre&s;t him. From the confidence he placed in the efforts, of his pretended friend, he &s;uffered him&s;elf to be conducted to pri&s;on, in perference to making any attempts to e&s;cape; and the gates were &s;hut again&s;t him, never to be opened for his enlarge|ment. The fal&s;e <HI>Raymond</HI> continued the ma&s;k no longer than an opportunity offered for ca&s;ting off the di&s;&s;embling veil; and the property which he was fir&s;t led to regard as imaginary, he now claimed as his lawful right. He was &s;ent for, from the dark&s;ome cell, and called on by the voice of his benefactor from the black rece&s;s of a pri&s;on. But the hardened wretch was deaf to the calls of him who had been his true&s;t friend, who&s;e ab&s;ence &s;erved to &s;uppre&s;s all kind of fear and re&s;traint. His an&s;wers, when he conde&s;cend|ed to make any, were vile as the mouth that uttered them, the imports of which were, that he had been his friend already too long, and that the period was now arrived that mu&s;t terminate all further intercour&s;e between them. He pretended ignorance of having any obligations to him, and affected to de&s;pi&s;e him as an impo&s;tor; one for whom repeated favours had be|come irk&s;ome, by their con&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Confined within the walls of a loath&s;ome goal, the unhappy <HI>Douxville</HI> was unable to ju&s;tify him&s;elf to the world, or to obtain the lea&s;t ju&s;tice from a wretch lo&s;t to all the feelings of humanity. In vain did the now mi&s;erable <HI>Douxville,</HI> by pathetic remon|&s;trances,

endeavour to rai&s;e a grateful &s;entiment in his brea&s;t.&mdash;Equally vain were his attempts to prove the property his and offer it in preference to his cred|itors in payment of his ju&s;t debts. It was in the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of a wretch undaunted by threats and demands, and who&s;e heart was thoroughly &s;teeled again&s;t the &s;oft language of milder intreaties. Every effort to ob|tain ju&s;tice became futile, and the hardened villian &s;ailed in a few days from the &s;hore, leaving his true&s;t friend in the deepe&s;t affliction and lowe&s;t mi&s;ery, to worry out the remainder of his exi&s;tence in a pri&s;on; where he was &s;oon overcome by the weight of his grief, &s;urviving only a few days the departure of the wretch who com|pleted his ruin and terminated his exi&s;tence. How fatal the effects of mi&s;placed confidence! The perpetra|tor of this horrid deed did not however e&s;cape with impunity. The enjoyment of his ill gotten trea&s;ures was but of &s;hort duration. Righteous heaven, to whom nothing is unknown, who pre&s;ides in ju&s;tice, and who pun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;hes &s;ooner or later the crimes of mankind, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> who&s;e di&s;cerning eye black ingratitude is never concealed, beheld in wrath the horrid deed. <HI>Raymond</HI> was overtaken by a &s;evere &s;torm &s;oon after his depart|ure, and the blue lightning from the &s;kies &s;hivered the ma&s;ts from the top to the &s;urface of the deck, and the ve&s;&s;el was left to the &s;port of the waves.&mdash;This &s;torm was &s;ucceeded by another more violent and more terri|ble: And the ve&s;&s;el was now almo&s;t incapable of longer re&s;i&s;ting the impetuo&s;ity of the watry element, beating without ce&s;&s;ation again&s;t every part.

<HEAD>THE HISTORY OF <HI>LEONORA,</HI> OR THE UN|FORTUNATE JILT.</HEAD>
<P>LEONORA was the daughter of a gentleman of fortune; &s;he was tall and well-&s;haped, with a &s;pright|line&s;s in her countenance, which often attracts beyond more regular features joined with an in&s;ipid air; nor is this kind of beauty le&s;s apt to deceive than allure the good humor which it indicates, being often mi&s;taken for good nature, and the vivacity for true under&s;tand|ing.</P>
<P>Leonora, who was now at the age of eighteen, lived with an aunt of her's in a town in the north of England. She was an extreme lover of gaiety; and very rarely mi&s;&s;ed a ball, or any other public a&s;&s;embly; where &s;he had frequently opportunities of &s;atisfying a greedy ap|petite of vanity with the preference which was given her by the men to almo&s;t every other woman pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>Among many young fellows who were particular in their gallantries towards her, Horatio &s;oon di&s;tin|gui&s;hed him&s;elf in her eyes beyond all his competitors; &s;he danced with more than ordinary gaiety when he happened to be her partner; neither the fairne&s;s of the evening nor the mu&s;ic of the nightingale, could length|en her walk like his company. She affected no longer to under&s;tand the civilities of others: whil&s;t &s;he inclined &s;o attentive an air to every compliment of Horatio, that &s;he often &s;miled even when it was too delicate for her comprehen&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="179" REF="032707_0178_0FF433F115892F00">Horatio, was a young gentleman of a good family <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">red to the law, and had been &s;ome few years called to the degree of a barri&s;ter. His face and per&s;on were &s;uch as the generality allowed hand&s;ome: but he had a dignity in his air very rarely to be &s;een. His temper was of the &s;aturnine complexion, and without the lea&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">aint of moro&s;ene&s;s. He had wit and humor, with an inclination to &s;atire, which he indulged rather too much.</P>
<P>This gentleman, who had contracted the mo&s;t vio|lent pa&s;&s;ion for Leonora, was the la&s;t per&s;on who per|ceived the probability of its &s;ucce&s;s. The whole town had made the match for him, before he him&s;elf had drawn a confidence from her actions &s;ufficient to men|tion his pa&s;&s;ion to her; for it was his opinion, (and perhaps he was there in the right) that it is highly im|politic to talk &s;eriou&s;ly of love to a woman before you have made &s;uch a progre&s;s in her affections, that &s;he her&s;elf expects and de&s;ires to hear it.</P>
<P>But whatever diffidence the fears of a lover may create, which are apt to magnify every favor conferred on a rival, and to &s;ee the little advances towards them|&s;eves thro the other end of the per&s;pective; it was im|po&s;&s;ible that Horatio's pa&s;&s;ion &s;hould &s;o blind his di&s;|cernment, as to prevent his conceiving hopes from the behavior of Leonora, who&s;e fondne&s;s for him was now as vi&s;ible to an indifferent per&s;on in their company, as his for her.</P>
<P>It was in the mid&s;t of a gay conver&s;ation in the walks one evening, when Horatio whi&s;pered Leonora, that he was de&s;irous to take a turn or two with her in
<PB N="180" REF="032707_0179_0FF42B5F68E694C0">
private, for that he had &s;omething to communicate <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> her of great con&s;equence. 'Are you &s;ure it is of con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;equence? &s;aid &s;he &s;miling&mdash;

<P>Leonora, who very much &s;u&s;pected what was com|ing, would have deferred it till another time: but Ho|ratio, who had more than half conquered the difficulty of &s;peaking, by the fir&s;t motion, was &s;o very impor|tunate, that &s;he at la&s;t yielded, and leaving the re&s;t of the company, they turned a&s;ide into an un<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">re|quented walk.</P>
<P>They had retired far out of the &s;ight of the com|pany, both maintaining a &s;trict &s;ilence. At la&s;t Ho|ratio made a full &s;top, and taking Leonora, who &s;tood pail and trembling, gently by the hand, he fetched a deep &s;igh, and then looking on her eyes with all the tenderne&s;s imaginable, he cried out in a faltering ac|cent; 'O Leonora! it is nece&s;&s;ary for me to declare to you on what the future happine&s;s of my life mu&s;t be founded! Mu&s;t I &s;ay, there is &s;omething belonging to you which is a bar to my happine&s;s, and which unle&s;s you will part with, I mu&s;t be mi&s;erable?' 'What can that be,' replied Leonora?&mdash; 'No wonder,' &s;aid he, 'you are &s;urprized that I &s;hould make an objection to any thing which is yours, yet &s;ure you may gue&s;s, &s;ince it is the only one which the riches of the world, if they were mine, &s;hould purcha&s;e of me&mdash;Oh it is that which you mu&s;t part with, to be&s;tow all the re&s;t!

<P>Leonora, covered with blu&s;hes, and with as an|gry a look as &s;he could po&s;&s;ibly put on, told him, that had &s;he &s;u&s;pected what his declaration would have been, he &s;hould not have decoyed her from her com|pany; that he had &s;o &s;urprized and frightened her, that &s;he begged him to convey her back as quick as po&s;&s;ible; which he, trembling very near as much as her&s;elf, did.</P>
<P>Many weeks had not pa&s;s'd after this interview, before Horatio and Leonora were what they call on a good footing together. All ceremonies except the la&s;t were now over; the writings were now drawn, and every thing was in the utmo&s;t forwardne&s;s pre|parative to the putting Horatio in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all his wi&s;hes. I will, if you plea&s;e, repeat you a letter from each of them which I have got by heart, and which will give you no &s;mall idea of their pa&s;&s;ion on both &s;ides.</P>

<P>Matters were in &s;o great forwardne&s;s between this fond couple, that the day was fixed for their marriage and was now within a fortnight, when the &s;e&s;&s;ions chanced to be held for that county in a town about twenty miles di&s;tance from that which is the &s;cene of our &s;tory.

<P>The &s;ame afternoon in which he left the town, as Leonora &s;tood at her window, a coach and &s;ix pa&s;&s;ed by, which &s;he declared to be the compleate&s;t, gen|teele&s;t, prettie&s;t equipage &s;he ever &s;aw; adding the&s;e remarkable words, 'O I am in love with that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">quipage!' which, tho her friend Florella at that time did not greatly regard, &s;he hath &s;ince remembered.</P>

<P>O why have no women as good re&s;olution to main|tain their vows, as they have often good inclinations in making them!</P>
<P>The gentleman who owned the coach and &s;ix came to the a&s;&s;embly. His clothes were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s remarka|bly fine as his equipage could be.

<P>He had on a cut velvet coat of a cinnamon colour, lined with a pink &s;attin, embroidered all over with gold: his wai&s;tcoat, which was cloth of &s;ilver, was embroidered with gold likewi&s;e.

<P>Leonora &s;aw her&s;elf admired by the fine &s;tranger, and envied by every woman pre&s;ent.

<P>In this temper of mind, Bellarmine, having enquir|ed who &s;he was, advanced to her, and with a low bow begged the honor of dancing with her, which &s;he with a low court'&s;y immediately granted.

<P>Leonora retired about &s;ix in the morning, but not to re&s;t.

<P>Thus, what Horatio had by &s;ighs and tears, lov<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and tenderne&s;s, been &s;o long obtaining, the French En|gli&s;h Bellarmine with gaiety and gallantry po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him|&s;elf of in an in&s;tant.

<P>From the opening of the a&s;&s;embly till the end of Bellarmine's vi&s;it, Leonora had &s;carce once thought of Horatio; but he now began, tho an unwelcome gue&s;t, to enter into her mind. She wi&s;hed &s;he had &s;een the charming Bellarmine and his charming equipage, before matters had gone &s;o far. 'Yet why (&s;ays &s;he) &s;hould I wi&s;h to have &s;een him before; or what &s;ignifies it that I have &s;een him now? Is not Horatio my lover? almo&s;t my hu&s;band? Is he not as hand&s;ome, nay hand&s;omer, than Bellarmine? Aye, but Bellarmine is the genteeler and the finer man; yes, that he mu&s;t be allowed. Yes, yes, he is that certainly. But did not I no longer than ye&s;terday love Horatio more than all the world? Aye, but ye&s;terday I had not &s;een Bellarmine. But doth not Horatio doat on me, and may he not in de&s;|pair break his heart if I abandon him? Well, &amp; hath not Bellarmine a heart to break too? Yes, but I promi&s;ed Horatio fir&s;t; but that was poor Bellarmine's misfor|tune; if I had &s;een him fir&s;t, I &s;hould certainly have prefered him. Did not the dear creature prefer me to every woman in the a&s;&s;embly, when every She was lay|ing out for him; When was it in Horatio's power to give me &s;uch an in&s;tance of affection?

She was thus arguing with her&s;elf, when &s;ome young ladies cal|led her to the walks, and a little relieved her anxiety for the pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>The next morning Bellarmine breakfa&s;ted with her in pre&s;ence of her aunt, whom he &s;ufficiently informed of his pa&s;&s;ion of Leonora: he was no &s;ooner withdrawn, than the old lady began to advi&s;e her nice on this occa&s;ion&mdash;'You &s;ee, child, (&s;ays &s;he) what fortune hath thrown in your way; and I hope you will not with&s;tand your own preferment.' Leonora &s;ighing, 'begged her not to mention any &s;uch thing, when &s;he knew her engagements to Horatio.' 'Engagements to a fig,' cryed the aunt; 'you &s;hould thank heaven on your knees, that you have it yet in your power to break them. Will any woman he&s;itate a moment, whether &s;he &s;hall ride in a coach, or walk on foot all the days of her life?&mdash;But Bellarmine drives &s;ix, and Horatio not even a pair.' 'Yes,' 'but, Madam, what will the world &s;ay?' an&s;wered Leonora; 'will they not condemn me?' 'The world is always on the &s;ide of

'O leave that to me,' &s;ays the aunt. 'You know your father hath not been acquainted with the affair.

<P>Leonora was at length &s;atisfied with her aunt's rea|&s;oning; and, Bellarmine &s;upping with her that even|ing, it was agreed he &s;hould the next morning go to her father and propo&s;e the match, which &s;he con&s;ented &s;hould be con&s;ummated at his return.</P>

Leonora an&s;wered, '&s;he thought them very pretty.' 'All French,' &s;ays he, 'I a&s;&s;ure you, except the great coats; I never tru&s;t any thing more than a great coat to an Engli&s;hman; you know one mu&s;t encourage our own people what one can, e&s;pecially as, before I had a place, I was in the country intere&s;t, he, he, he! but for my&s;elf, I would &s;ee the dirty i&s;land at the bottom of the &s;ea, rather than wear a &s;ingle rag of Engli&s;h work about me; and I am &s;ure after you have made one tour to Paris, you will be of the &s;ame opinion with re|gard to your own clothes.

I po&s;itively a&s;&s;ure you, at the fir&s;t opera I &s;aw &s;ince I came over, I mi&s;took the Engli&s;h ladies for chamber-maids, he, he, he!'</P>
<P>With &s;uch &s;ort of polite di&s;cour&s;e did the gay Bel|larmine entertain his beloved Leonora, when the door opened on a &s;udden, and Horatio entered the room. Here 'tis impo&s;&s;ible to expe&s;s the &s;urprize of Leonora.</P>

Do you intend to affront me before this gentleman?' 'D&mdash;n me, af|front the lady,' &s;ay Bellarmine, cocking his hat, and &s;trutting up to Horatio. 'Does any man dare affront this lady before me, d&mdash;n me?' 'Hearkee, Sir,' &s;ays Horatio, 'I would advi&s;e you to lay a&s;ide that fierce air; for I am mightily deceived, if this lady has not a violent de&s;ire to get your wor&s;hip a good drubbing.'

She convin|ced him that he was never more awake in his life, and that nothing more extraordinary had happened in his three days ab&s;ence, than a &s;mall alteration in the affections of Leonora; who now bur&s;t into tears, and wondered what rea&s;on &s;he had given him to u&s;e her in
<PB N="194" REF="032707_0193_0FF4340377EBB838">
&s;o barbarous a manner. Horatio de&s;ired Bellarmine to withdraw with him: but the ladies prevented it, by laying violent hands on the latter; upon which, the former took his leave without any great ceremony, and departed, leaving the lady with his rival to con&s;ult for his &s;afety, which Leonora feared her indi&s;cretion might have endangered: but the aunt comforted her with a&s;&s;urances, that Horatio, would not venture his per&s;on again&s;t &s;o accompli&s;hed a cavalier as Bellar|mine; and that, being a lawyer, he would &s;eek re|venge in his own way, and the mo&s;t they had to ap|prehend from him was an action.</P>
<P>They at length therefore agreed to permit Bellarmine to retire to his lodgings, having fir&s;t &s;ettled all matters relating to the journey which he was to undertake in the morning, and their preparations for the nuptials at his return.</P>
<P>But alas! as wi&s;e men have ob&s;erved, the &s;eat of val|or is not the countenance; and many a grave and plain man, will, on a ju&s;t provocation, betake him&s;elf to that mi&s;chievous metal, cold iron; while men of fiercer brow, and &s;ometimes with that emblem of courage, a cockade, will more prudently decline it.</P>
<P>Leonora was waked in the morning, from a vi&s;iona|ry coach and fix, with the di&s;mal account, that Bellar|mine was run thro the body by Horatio: that he lay langui&s;hing at an inn, and the &s;urgeons had declared the wound mortal. She immediately leaped out of the bed danced about the room in a frantic manner, tore her hair, and beat her brea&s;t in all the agonies of de&s;pair; in which &s;ad condition her aunt, who likewi&s;e aro&s;e at
<PB N="195" REF="032707_0194_0FF433FFC7CDAE40">
the news, found her. The good old lady applied her almo&s;t art to comfort her niece. She told her, 'while <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">here was life there was hope; but that if he &s;hould die, her affliction &s;hould be of no &s;ervice to Bellarmine, and would only expo&s;e her&s;elf, which might probably keep her &s;ome time without any future offer; that as mat|ters had happened, her wi&s;e&s;t way would be to think no more of Bellarmine, but to endeavor to regain the affections of Horatio.' 'Speak not to me,' cryed the di&s;con&s;olate Leonora; 'is it not owing to me, that poor Bellarmine has lo&s;t his life? have not the&s;e cur&s;ed charms' (at which words &s;he looked &s;tedfa&s;tly in the gla&s;s) 'been the ruin of the mo&s;t charming man of his age? Can I ever bear to contemplate my own face again? (with her eyes &s;till fixed on the gla&s;s.) 'Am I not the murdre&s;s of the fine&s;t gentleman? no other woman in the town could have made any impre&s;&s;ion on him.' 'Never think of things pa&s;t,' cries the aunt, 'think of regaining the affections of Horatic.' 'What rea&s;on,' &s;aid the niece, 'have I to hope he would for|give me? No, I have lo&s;t him as well as the other, and it was your wicked advice which was the occa&s;ion of all; you &s;educed me, contrary to my inclinations, to abandon poor Horatio,' at which words &s;he bur&s;t into tears; you prevailed upon me, whether I would or not, give up my affections for him; had it not been for you, Bellarmine never would have entered into my thoughts; had not his addre&s;&s;es been backed by your per&s;ua&s;ions, they never would have made any impre&s;|&s;ion on me; I &s;hould have defied all fortune and equip|age in the world; but it was you, it was you, who got

the better of my youth and &s;implicity, and forced me to lo&s;e my dear Horatio for ever.'</P>
<P>The aunt was almo&s;t borne down with this torren<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of words; &s;he however rallied all the &s;trength &s;he could, and drawing her mouth up in a pur&s;e, began: I am not &s;urpri&s;ed, Niece, at this ingratitude. Tho&s;e who advi&s;e young women for their intere&s;t, mu&s;t al|ways expect &s;uch a return: I am convinced my brother will thank me for breaking off your match with Horatio at any rate.' 'That may not be in your power yet,' an&s;wered Leonora; 'tho it is very ungrateful in you to de&s;ire or attempt it, after the pre&s;ents you have received from him.' (For indeed true it is, that many pre&s;ents, and &s;ome pretty valuable ones, had pa&s;&s;ed from Horatio to the old lady: but as true it is, that Bellar|mine, when he breakfa&s;ted with her and her niece, had complimented her with a brilliant from his finger, of much greater value than all &s;he had touched of the ot<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">er.)</P>
<P>The aunt's gall was on float to reply, when a &s;ervant brought a letter into the room; which Leonora, hear|ing it came from Bellarmine, with great eagerne&s;s open|ed, and read as follows:

<P>As &s;oon as Leonora perceived &s;uch hopes of Bel|larmine's recovery, and that the go&s;&s;ip Fame had, ac|cording to cu&s;tom, &s;o enlarged his danger, &s;he pre&s;ent|ly abandoned all further thoughts of Horatio, and was &s;oon reconciled to her aunt, who received her again in|to favor, with a more chri&s;tian forgivene&s;s than we generally meet with. Indeed, it is po&s;&s;ible, &s;he might <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e a little alarmed at the hints which her niece had given her concerning the pre&s;ents. She might appre|hend &s;uch rumors, &s;hould they get abroad, might injure a reputation, which, by frequenting church twice a day, and pre&s;erving the utmo&s;t rigor and &s;trictne&s;s in her countenance and behavior for many years, &s;he had e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>
<P>Leonora's pa&s;&s;ion returned now for Bellarmine, with greater force after its &s;mall relaxation than ever. She propo&s;ed to her aunt to make him a vi&s;it in his con|finement, which the old lady, with great and commend|able prudence, advi&s;ed her to decline: 'For,' &s;ays &s;he, '&s;hould any accident intervene to prevent your intend|ed match, too forward a behavior with this lover may injure you in the eyes of others. Every woman, till &s;he is married, ought to con&s;ider of and provide again&s;t the po&s;&s;ibility of the affair's breaking off.' Leonora &s;aid, '&s;he &s;hould be indifferent to whatever might hap|pen

She there|fore re&s;olved to vi&s;it him, notwith&s;tanding all the pru|dent advice of her aunt to the contrary, and that very afternoon executed her re&s;olution.</P>
<P>Leonora having once broke through the bounds which cu&s;tom and mode&s;ty impo&s;e on her &s;ex, &s;oon gave an unbridled indulgence to her pa&s;&s;ion. Her vi&s;its to Bellarmine were more con&s;tant, as well as longer, than his &s;urgeon's; in a word, &s;he became ab&s;olutely his nur&s;e, made his water-grewel, admini&s;|tered him his medicines, and, notwith&s;tanding the prudent advice of her aunt to the contrary, almo&s;t entirely re&s;ided in her wounded lover's apartment.</P>
<P>The ladies of the town began to take her conduct under con&s;ideration; it was the chief topic of di&s;cour&s;e at their tea tables, and was very &s;everely cen&s;ured by the mo&s;t part; e&s;pecially by Lindamira, a lady who&s;e di&s;creet and &s;tarch carriage, together with a con&s;tant attendance at church three times a day, had utterly de|feated malicious attacks on her own reputation: for &s;uch was the envy that Lindamira's virtue had attracted, that, notwith&s;tanding her own &s;trict behavior and &s;trict inquiry into the lives of others &s;he had not been able to e&s;cape being the mark of &s;ome arrows her&s;elf, which however did her no injury; a ble&s;&s;ing perhaps owned by her to the clergy, who were her chief male compan|ions, and with two or three of whom &s;he had been bar|barou&s;ly and unju&s;tly calumniated.</P>
<P><PB N="199" REF="032707_0198_0FF434014D74E688">The extreme delicacy of Lindamira's virtue was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">elly hurt by tho&s;e freedoms which Leonora allowed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">&s;elf: &s;he &s;aid it was an affront to her &s;ex; 'that &s;he did dot imagine it con&s;i&s;tent with any woman's ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">or to &s;peak to the creature, or to be &s;een in her company; and that, for her part; &s;he &s;hould always refu&s;e to dance at an a&s;&s;embly with her, for fear of contamination by taking her by the hand.'</P>
<P>But to return to my &s;tory: as &s;oon as Bellarmine was recovered, which was &s;omewhat within a month from his receiving the wound, he &s;at out according to agreement, for Leonora's father's, in order to propo&s;e the match, and &s;ettle all matters with him touching &s;ettlements, and the like.</P>
<P>A little before his arrival, the old gentlemen had received an intimation of the affair by the following letter; which I can repeat <HI>verbatim,</HI> and which, they &s;ay, was written neither by Leonora nor her aunt, tho it was in the woman's hand. The letter was in the&s;e words:

He pa&s;&s;ed, in the world's lan|guage, as an exceeding good father, being not only &s;o rapacious as to rob and plunder all mankind to the utmo&s;t of his power, but even to deny him&s;elf the conveniencies and almo&s;t nece&s;&s;aries of life; which his neighbors attributed to a de&s;ire of rai&s;ing im|men&s;e fortunes for his children; but in fact it was not &s;o: he heaped up money for his own &s;ake only, and looked on his children as his rivals, who were to enjoy his beloved mi&s;tre&s;s, when he was incapable of po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ing her, and which he would have been much more charmed with the power of carrying along with him: nor had his children any other &s;ecurity of being his heirs, than that the law would con&s;titute them &s;uch without a will, and that he had not affections enough for any one living to take the trouble of writing one.</P>
<P>To this gentleman came Bellarmine on the errand I have mentioned.

<HEAD>THE STORY OF THE TWO SISTERS.</HEAD>
<P>TOWARDS the end of tho&s;e trouble&s;o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> times, when ENGLAND was &s;haken by the feuds of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> hou&s;es of York and Lanca&s;ter, there re&s;ided, in a vil|lage near the bank of the Medway, a gentleman, who&s;e name was Geoffry de Saint Clair, de&s;cended from a family of great antiquity and repute in tho&s;e parts. The many launces, and pieces of armour, that hung round the old hall, did not render it more re&s;|pectable, that did the unbounded benevolence of its pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or. The poor &s;at at his gate, and ble&s;|&s;ed his liberal hand; and never a pilgrim repo&s;ed in his porch, without remembering, in his ori&s;ons, its ho&s;pitable owner.</P>
<P>Saint Clair had allied him&s;elf in marriage with the Lady Margaret de Boys, a woman of high birth and rare endowments; who&s;e accompli&s;hments might have embelli&s;hed the greate&s;t &s;cenes, had not a love of do|me&s;tic life and a religious ca&s;t of mind, induced her to prefer retirement. All her lei&s;ure hours, which her family did not call for, were &s;pent in duties, which, in that age, ladies of the noble&s;t rank exerci&s;ed, without thinking they demeaned their &s;tations;&mdash;&s;he relieved the indigent,&mdash;advi&s;ed with the unfortunate,&mdash;vi&s;ited the &s;ick,&mdash;and brought up her <HI>Twin Daughters,</HI> Fran|ces and I&s;abella, in the &s;ame &s;entiments;&mdash;accu&s;tom|ing them very early, to attend upon her in all tho&s;e acts of primitive piety. As the&s;e young ladies were the &s;ole i&s;&s;ue of Saint Clair and Lady Margaret, they
<PB N="205" REF="032707_0204_0FF42B3704900B88">
devoted their whole attention to their education; and and the comfort to find in their minds, &s;o rich a &s;oil, that every thing pro&s;pered which was planted in them: &mdash;no u&s;eful knowledge was omitted,&mdash;no external ac|compli&s;hment neglected.</P>
<P>Frances and I&s;abella were now arrived at the age of twenty five. The amiablene&s;s of their characters, their enlarged under&s;tanding, and the gracefulne&s;s of their per&s;ons, won the admiration and e&s;teem of all who approached them. They had, from &s;imilitude of manners, and &s;entiment, contracted &s;uch a rare affec|tion for each other, that it &s;eemed as if Nature, by for|ming them together in the womb, had prepared them for that extraordinary union, which was to di&s;tingui&s;h their lives,&mdash;and for tho&s;e effu&s;ions of elevated friend|&s;hip, which the lo&s;s of their exemplary mother was one day to call forth. Nor was this event very re|mote; Lady Margaret was &s;eized by a &s;udden illne&s;s which, in a few days, carried her off, and de&s;olated one of the happie&s;t families in the world.</P>
<P>It would be difficult to de&s;cribe the &s;ounds of woe, which on this occa&s;ion, echoed through all the man|&s;ions, or the &s;ighs of the di&s;con&s;olate poor, under the windows.&mdash;The grief of Saint Clair, after the many years of uninterrupted happine&s;s that he had enjoyed with lady Margaret, in its fir&s;t attack, almo&s;t over|powered his rea&s;on;&mdash;whil&s;t Frances and I&s;abella had the weight of a father's &s;orrow added to their own; which compelled them to &s;mother their feelings, great as they were, and to a&s;&s;ume a fortitude their hearts di&s;avowed.</P>

<P>The Saint Clair called in aid all his philo&s;ophy, to &s;upport him&s;elf under the lo&s;s of his beloved Lady Margaret, yet he was worn, by a &s;ilent &s;orrow, which had &s;o vi&s;ible an effect on his health, as to menace his life; and which, in about a year, put an end to it.</P>
<P>In this mournful interval, the greate&s;t comfort his dejected daughters received, was from the frequent vi&s;its of their uncle, John de Saint Clair&mdash;who was at that time Abbot of the mona&s;tery of Saint Augu&s;tin, in Canterbury; of which place there are, at this day, &s;uch noble remains exi&s;ting. He was the younger brother of Geoffry, though there was but the difference of a year between them; and was reputed to be a man of &s;o much learning and virtue, that Saint Clair, by his will, recommended his children to his care and protection; bequeathing to each of them a very large inheritance.</P>
<P>&mdash;The manner in which Frances had been brought up, added to her natural turn of mind, and the example of a mother &s;he &s;o much revered, determined her to a life
<PB N="207" REF="032707_0206_0FF433AA9AA7C6B8">
of religious retirement;&mdash;and a great convent of Bene|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">tine Nuns, not very di&s;tant from Fever&s;ham, hap|pening a few months after, to lo&s;e their principal (who was always one of a con&s;iderable family) the Abbot of Saint Augu&s;tin, perceiving her fixed in her &s;cheme of life, procured her to be named the Lady Abbe&s;s of it.</P>
<P>I&s;abella, who had never as yet been &s;eparated from her &s;i&s;ter, would on this occa&s;ion, mo&s;t willingly have taken the veil. "The &s;ame roof," &s;ays &s;he, "hath ever hitherto covered us,&mdash;the &s;ame have been our wi&s;hes &mdash;the &s;ame our pur&s;uits;&mdash;the grave hath divided us, from tho&s;e, who taught us the amiablene&s;s of friend|&s;hip,&mdash;and &s;hall alone divide us from one ano|ther!"</P>
<P>&mdash;The Abbot was much hurt by this declaration of his niece. He de&s;ired her to bani&s;h from her thought, &s;uch a re&s;olution;&mdash;and failed not to intimate to her, that Frances, having devoted her&s;elf to the cloy&s;ter&punc; &s;he remained the only &s;upport of the family of Saint Clair; that her virtues &s;hould rather embelli&s;h &s;ociety, than be lo&s;t within the walls of a mona&s;tery;&mdash;and wi&s;hed &s;he would, by accepting &s;ome alliance of &s;uita|ble rank and fortune, rather permit tho&s;e accompli&s;h|ments to be &s;een by the world, which &s;he &s;ought to hide in oblivion.</P>
<P>Frances, on her part, however &s;he was charmed with this te&s;timony of her &s;i&s;ter's affection, joined in &s;entiment with her uncle,&mdash;expre&s;&s;ing to her, how much happier &s;he &s;hould be, to &s;ee her &s;ettle her&s;elf by marriage, and imitate the good life and example of their excellent mother.&mdash;</P>

<P>&mdash;It was not but with great difficulty, nor even <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ill much time after, that, by the repeated &s;olicitations of Frances, and her uncle, I&s;abella was prevailed on to relinqui&s;h entirely, her intentions of entering on a mona&s;tic life.&mdash;She re&s;ided for &s;ome time, in her father's venerable old man&s;ion on the Medway, accompanied by a widowed aunt, her father's &s;i&s;ter;&mdash;who at in|tervals, attended her on vi&s;its to Frances,&mdash;and al&s;o, at particular &s;ea&s;ons, to the Abbot, at his hou&s;e which was a noble building, adjoining to the mona&s;tery of Saint Augu&s;tin.</P>
<P>&mdash;It was in one of the&s;e vi&s;its to her uncle, that &s;he became acquainted with Henry de Belville, between who&s;e father and the Abbot, there had long &s;ub&s;i&s;ted a mo&s;t firm friend&s;hip. He was of good birth, though much inferior to I&s;abella in fortune; his father's e&s;tate having greatly &s;uffered in the confu&s;ion of tho&s;e turbu|lent times.</P>
<P>Belville was now in his twentyninth year;&mdash;his figure was graceful and manly,&mdash;and, to a di&s;po&s;ition as

<P>Belville, on his fir&s;t return to England, a few years previous to the pre&s;ent period, had been honored by the patronage of Richard Duke of Glouce&s;ter; near who&s;e per&s;on he held an employment, which could not long di&s;pence with his ab&s;ence;&mdash;for that prince, being now mounted on the throne of England, the whole nation was thrown into an ho&s;tile &s;tate.</P>
<P>It will not be wondered at, if after Belville and I&s;a|bella had been a few days together, their mutual accom|pli&s;hments, and their mutual de&s;ire to plea&s;e, &s;hould have made them much charmed with one another. Bel|ville felt him&s;elf enamoured of his fair companion,&mdash; and had the &s;atisfaction to perceive, that his attention to her was not thrown away. Tho he took leave, after a &s;hort time, to go to London, yet he found an ex|cu&s;e for returning very &s;oon;&mdash;and having rea&s;on to think he had made a favorable impre&s;&s;ion on I&s;abella, did not long he&s;itate to propo&s;e him&s;elf to her, as one who would be happy to pa&s;s his life in the &s;ociety of &s;o engaging a woman. His offer was not le&s;s plea&s;ing to I&s;abella, than it was to her uncle, and Frances;&mdash;the latter of whom agreed to give up to her &s;i&s;ter, her right

<P>&mdash;I&s;abella now found in religion, the only con&s;ola|tion for her pa&s;t misfortunes;&mdash;and tho the remem|brance of her Belville, would often come acro&s;s her, and &s;pread a temporary gloom over her mind,&mdash;yet &s;he con|&s;tantly &s;trove to di&s;pel it, by piety and re&s;ignation. The two Si&s;ters enjoyed all that heart felt plea&s;ure, which ari&s;es from rooted friend&s;hip;&mdash;and, as the effects of benevolent di&s;po&s;itions operate on all around, theirs &s;erved to commmunicate happine&s;s to all the Si&s;terhood.</P>
<P>The Louvain <HI>Manu&s;cript</HI> informs us, that after the&s;e ladies had pa&s;&s;ed near fourteen years in this peaceful retirement, the Abbe&s;s was &s;eized with an alarming fe|ver, the effects of which hung &s;o long upon her, that they greatly endangered her life. It is not difficult to conceive, how &s;evere I&s;abella's &s;ufferings were, in this dreadful interval of &s;u&s;pen&s;e and apprehen&s;ion, or the anxieties of her mind, till her Si&s;ter was re&s;tored to health.</P>
<P>FRANCES during her illne&s;s, had made a private vow to the <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed Virgin</HI> Mary, that if &s;he recovered, &s;he would &s;end &s;ome co&s;tly offering to a chapel, which was con&s;ecrated to her, at a little Port, called Brad&s;tow or Broad&s;tairs, in the i&s;le of Thanet (part of which chapel is at this day <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">maining);&mdash;and in which, her image was e&s;teemed to work &s;uch great miracles, that Pilgrims came from parts very remote, to vi&s;it it;&mdash;and

it was held in &s;uch veneration, that all &s;hips pa&s;&s;ing within fight of it; are reported to have con&s;tantly lowered their top &s;ails, to &s;alute it. And the fea&s;t of the Invention of the Holy Cro&s;s, which was the third day of May, being to be celebrated there, with great &s;olemnity,&mdash;her gratitude for her recovery, and for the &s;uppo&s;ed interce&s;&s;ion of the Virgin, determined her to go her&s;elf at that time and fulfil her vow.</P>
<P>I&s;abella obtained permi&s;&s;ion to accompany her &s;i&s;ter in this devout purpo&s;e;&mdash;and the roads being little frequented in that age, and a hor&s;e almo&s;t the only conveyance&mdash;they re&s;olved to put them&s;elves, with two attendants, aboard a pa&s;&s;age-&s;loop, that u&s;ually went at &s;tated times, from Fever&s;ham to Broad-&s;tairs, and other parts along the coa&s;t, between that place and the Downs.</P>
<P>&mdash;They &s;et &s;ail in the evening, but had not been at &s;ea above two hours, before a violent &s;torm aro&s;e.

<P>&mdash;The &s;urpri&s;e&mdash;the confu&s;ion&mdash;and the image of death, that mu&s;t naturally ru&s;h into the minds of peo|ple, who are on the point of being wrecked,&mdash;can only be ju&s;tly felt, or de&s;cribed by tho&s;e who have &s;tood in &s;o dreadful a &s;ituation.

<P>Scarce was the boat on the &s;urface of the waves, when every one was eager to ru&s;h into it; for it was certain the ve&s;&s;el mu&s;t bilge in a few hours,&mdash;and, to add to the horror, night advanced. The Captain, almo&s;t by force, dragged the Lady Abbe&s;s, and her Si&s;|ter, from the cabin,&mdash;and &s;carce had he helped the fir&s;t, half dead as &s;he was, down the &s;ide of the &s;hip, when tho&s;e who were already in the boat, finding they mu&s;t all peri&s;h, if more got in, pu&s;hed off in&s;tantly, and rowed towards &s;hore,&mdash;in &s;pite of the menaces of the Captain, who &s;tood on deck, &s;upporting I&s;abella,&mdash;the intreaties of the Abbe&s;s, who was wild to return,&mdash;or the cries of the pa&s;&s;engers left behind.</P>
<P>&mdash;The only faint hope which now remained to

<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">o&s;e on board, was, that the ve&s;&s;el might po&s;&s;ibly hold t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">her, till &s;ome a&s;&s;i&s;tance could be obtained from the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">; which they &s;till flattered them&s;elves would come, in ca&s;e the boat reached the land,&mdash;which it prov|identially did, tho with the utmo&s;t ri&s;k. Every one who remained in the ve&s;&s;el was re&s;igned to his fate;&mdash; and &s;urrounded as I&s;abella was, by impending death, it afforded no &s;mall con&s;olation to her, to think, there was a po&s;&s;ibility that her Si&s;ter had e&s;caped.</P>
<P>&mdash;It was four hours after the arrival of the boat, before any one dur&s;t venture out; when, the &s;torm abating with the departure of the tide, and the day be|ing near dawning, a large boat put off to the wreck. When tho&s;e who went to a&s;&s;i&s;t, got to it, they found all the people on board, retired to different places be|neath the deck,&mdash;great part of which was broken away. I&s;abella had remained in the cabin; one &s;ide of which was al&s;o wa&s;hed off, and the room half filled with water;&mdash;&s;he was almo&s;t exhau&s;ted, by the terrors &s;he had &s;u&s;tained,&mdash;the brui&s;es &s;he had received,&mdash;and the extreme cold in which &s;he had &s;o long &s;uffered. They led her with the utmo&s;t gentlene&s;s from this wretched place,&mdash;while &s;he, all pale and trembling, &s;carcely comprehended at fir&s;t what they were doing;&mdash; yet life &s;eemed to flu&s;h anew in her countenance, on hearing that her Si&s;ter was pre&s;erved.&mdash;</P>
<P>&mdash;As &s;oon as they had brought her on &s;hore, &s;he was &s;upported by &s;everal women, who were waiting to receive her; and conducted to the hou&s;e where the la|dy Abbe&s;s was. Frances, tran&s;ported at the fir&s;t &s;ight of her Si&s;ter, ran out to meet I&s;abella,&mdash;who the mo|ment

<P>I&s;abella was immediately put into bed, and received every a&s;&s;i&s;tance that could be procured;&mdash;but her &s;trength and &s;pirits were &s;o far exhau&s;ted, by the terror and fatigue, which her mind and body had undergone, and by remaining &s;o many hours in water, that &s;he lived but till the evening of the following day.</P>
<P>Frances, tho &s;till &s;inking from the &s;hock and agita|tion of the preceeding night, forgot, in her attention to her Si&s;ter, her own &s;ufferings. She never &s;tirred from her bed&s;ide,&mdash;and often accu&s;ed her&s;elf, as being the fatal cau&s;e of all that had befallen her, by &s;uffering her attendance in this expedition. I&s;abella chid her for thinking &s;o,&mdash;declaring it was the will of heaven, to, which &s;he patiently &s;ubmitted. "Tho we came into the world together," &s;ays &s;he, "yet as we were not de&s;tined to peri&s;h together,&mdash;a time mu&s;t inevitably have come, when death would have di&s;&s;olved our un|ion. I rejoice that I am not the &s;urvivor. I die, where I have ever wi&s;hed to live, in the arms of the mo&s;t beloved of &s;i&s;ters. Pray for the repo&s;e of my &s;oul; &mdash;and lay me in the tomb which you have allotted to be your own&mdash;that one grave may in death hold our remains, who in life had but one heart."</P>
<P>The lo&s;s of I&s;abella plunged the lady Abbe&s;s into that deep di&s;tre&s;s, which minds, formed like her's with

the noble&s;t &s;entiments of tenderne&s;s, and benevolence, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, on &s;uch a trial, inevitably feel. She cau&s;ed the body of her unfortunate &s;i&s;ter to be tran&s;ported in &s;olemnity to their convent;&mdash;where, after it had been expo&s;ed with accu&s;tomed rites, it was depo&s;ited, with every mark of re&s;pect, in a vault, on one &s;ide of the &s;hrine of Saint Benedict,&mdash;bedewed with tears of the mo&s;t heart-felt &s;orrow, dropped from the eyes all the &s;i&s;|terhood.</P>
<P>When time and reflection had &s;omewhat calmed her affliction, Frances failed not to tran&s;mit, by the hands of her Confe&s;&s;or, (her uncle, the Abbot, having been &s;ometime dead) her intended offering to the <HI>Vir|gin of</HI> Broad-Stairs,&mdash;accompanied by a donation of twelve ma&s;&s;es, to be &s;aid for the repo&s;e of I&s;abella's &s;oul. And &s;oon after, to perpetuate the memory of her Si&s;|ter,&mdash;as well as to direct mariners in their cour&s;e,&mdash; that they might e&s;cape the &s;ad calamnity her&s;elf had &s;o fatally experienced,&mdash;&s;he cau&s;ed a very ancient church, that &s;tood on a ri&s;ing ground ju&s;t above the village of Reculver, and which was greatly fallen into decay, to be re&s;tored, and much enlarged,&mdash;and at one end there|of erected <HI>two Towers</HI> with <HI>lofty Spires</HI> upon them,&mdash; the which &s;he directed &s;hould be called THE SISTERS! &mdash;and to this day it retains the name, and is a &s;ea mark of great utility.</P>
<P>In le&s;s than &s;even years, the whole church was completed; which &s;he endowed very liberally, by a grant out of her own fortune;&mdash;and ordained, that there &s;hould be celebrated one &s;olemn ma&s;s <HI>on the fir&s;t day</HI> of every month (the wreck having happened on

Being a genteel han&s;ome young fellow, he made a very elegant appearance, and did cre|dit to hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> corps. In this &s;ituation he was &s;oon di&s;tin|gui&s;hed by many demireps upon the ton, and having a natural pa&s;&s;ion for gallantry, failed not to improve eve|ry opportunity that pre&s;ented it&s;elf for promoting an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mour. In the&s;e pur&s;uits he found that the pay of an en&s;ign would &s;carce pay coach<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hire, and he &s;oon di&s;|covered, that he was &s;o much in arrears with his agent, that he would advance Frank no more money.</P>
<P>In this &s;ituation he &s;aw no other hope than having recour&s;e to play, in which he was for &s;ometime pretty &s;ucce&s;sful, &amp; was, by his good fortune at the hazard ta|ble, enabled to make a more &s;plendid figure than ever, &amp; even his mi&s;tre&s;&s;es more valuable pre&s;ents. He &s;et up a chariot, upon the death of his father, which hapened about this period, he gave out that he had come to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of an e&s;tate of two thou&s;and a year, when, in fact, all he gained by this demi&s;e was fifty pounds for mourning, and a ring.</P>

a &s;trong recommendation to the ladies, who now viewed him with more partial eyes than ever; and finding his influence, he re&s;olved to turn it to &s;ome ac|count, &amp; to realize his nominal e&s;tate, in that of a wi&s;e. He had &s;carce come to this re&s;olution, before a lady pre|&s;ented her&s;elf with about fifteen thou&s;and pounds in her po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, being of age, and out of the clutches of her guardian. Mi&s;s Ellis was about twenty-three, tall and genteel, rather &s;howy than hand&s;ome; but, upon the whole, very well calculated to make an agreeable wi&s;e, and a dome&s;tic life completly comfortable.</P>
<P>Frank let no opportunity e&s;cape of advancing his &s;uit: and the lady had &s;o far con&s;ented, and the day of their nuptials was appointed. In the interim, a mo&s;t unfortunate affair happened to Frank. He one night engaged in a party at picquet with a celebrated Black legs, well known upon the turf, to whom he lo&s;t two hundred pounds. An apology was &s;ufficient for the evening; but on the morrow, a farther apology was fruitle&s;s, Paddy &s;aid, this is 'tother &s;ide of enough&mdash;a man with two thou&s;and a year, to make two apologies for &s;uch a trifle as two hundred&mdash;no, no&mdash;my dear, it won't do&mdash;I had a mi&s;erable ill run my&s;elf la&s;t week at Newmarket&mdash;and &s;o do you &s;ee, I &s;hall meet you here to morrow at twelve, and we mu&s;t &s;ettle it one way or other." Saying this he took a French leave, and left poor Frank to his own melancholy reflections. What was to be done?&mdash;If he a&s;ked Mi&s;s Ellis to lend him money, it would ruin his match, that was to take place in about a week&mdash;To morrow he mu&s;t either pay or fight, which was a very di&s;agreeable alternative. In a

<P>Unfortunately for Frank, Mi&s;s Ellis had a near re|lation in the &s;ame regiment, and as occurrences of this kind &s;oon get abroad, and become the &s;ubject of ani|madver&s;ion among officers of the &s;ame corps, it became, in a day or two, the &s;ubject of conver&s;ation at mi&s;s Ellis's teatable. She was greatly alarmed at the intel|ligence, but &s;uppre&s;&s;ed her a&s;toni&s;hment at the informa|tion, and endeavoured to account for the tran&s;action, by &s;aying, "She heard Mr Gaylove was on the point of being married, and doubtle&s;s that was the cau&s;e of his &s;elling out of the army." But her kind&s;man a&s;&s;ured her that &s;he was mi&s;taken in this re&s;pect, as he was informed Mr. Gaylove had &s;old his commi&s;&s;ion to pay a gaming debt.&mdash;"Pay a gaming debt (&s;aid 'mi&s;s Ellis) Heavens does he game? you a&s;toni&s;h me, I have always heard him declare the greate&s;t abhorrence for play." Ha! ha! ha! re&s;umed the captain, you are very much deceived; there is not a man who plays deeper in all the purlieus of St. James's. Mi&s;s Ellis now became very &s;erious; and of cour&s;e very bad company, when her relation retired.</P>
<P>He had not long gone before Frank made his appear|ance, when he found Mi&s;s Ellis in a very melancholy &s;ituation&mdash;Her an&s;wer to all his que&s;tions were very cool and conci&s;e. He urged her very &s;trenuou&s;ly to ex+plain the cau&s;e of her very uncommon behaviour, when eclarici&s;&s;ement en&s;ued: &s;he then &s;aid, that a &s;oldier was the idol of her heart, and that &s;he had re&s;olved never to
<PB N="239" REF="032707_0238_0FF42BB2B868D390">
marry any other; and if he had that e&s;teem for her which he pretended, he would buy it again the fir&s;t opportunity, for that &s;he would not give him her hand till he bore a commi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Frank took his leave in a promi&s;e to obey her man|dates&mdash;but, alas! it was impo&s;&s;ible in his pre&s;ent &s;itua|tion. He had but one chance, which was very un|promi&s;ing&mdash;but one glimmering of hope; which was very forlorn. He was in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of about a hundred and fifty pounds, the re&s;idue of the &s;ale of his commi&s;|&s;ion; and with this he was re&s;olved to make a pu&s;h at the gaming-table, in the flattering expectation that the blind godde&s;s would, for once, &s;mile propitiou&s;ly on him.</P>
<P>He accordingly had recour&s;e that very evening, to the box and dice; and the bones, to &s;peak in the gambling phra&s;eology, were pretty favourable to him: but twenty pounds were no objects to him in his pre&s;ent &s;ituation. In fine, he pur&s;ued his plan for about three weeks; at the end of which time, he was neither a con|&s;iderable lo&s;er or gainer&mdash;but his expences had eat up near a moiety of the relics of his fortune. He, never|thele&s;s, continued paying his vi&s;its to Mi&s;s Ellis, but did not meet with that cordial reception he had hitherto done, and not a &s;ylable of the nuptial day ever now tran&s;pired; tho he a&s;&s;ured her he was then in treaty for a cornet<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y of dragoons.</P>
<P>Three weeks were expired, and affairs &s;till remained in &s;tatu quo, till one morning at breakfa&s;t, at the coffee hou&s;e, he read with a&s;toni&s;hment&mdash;"Ye&s;terday morn|ing was married at St. James' church captain D&mdash;

of the guards, to Mi&s;s Ellis, a beautiful young lady&punc; with a hand&s;ome fortune." He &s;lung down the paper in rage, broke all the tea equipage, damned the whole &s;ex and &s;lew out of the room; to the great a&s;toni&s;hment of every one pre&s;ent, who for the mo&s;t part judged he was mad.</P>
<P>Thus &s;ituated&mdash;the came up with Mi&s;s Eills&mdash;He had another game to play, and he was re&s;olved to pay more attention to his cards, and never make &s;uch an|other matrimonial revoke. He was by this time re|duced to his la&s;t ten pieces, when being at a city ball, he danced with a lady whom he found to be a widow, and in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a hand&s;ome jointure. Having gained this intelligence, he re&s;olved to cultivate the acquaintance, and waited upon her the next day, to in|quire after her health, and hoped &s;he had taken no cold.</P>
<P>Mrs. Harri&s;on, the lady in que&s;tion, received him very politely, as &s;he had entertained &s;ome prejudices in his favor the night before, from the elegance of his per&s;on, and the graceful manner of his dancing. His conver&s;ation &s;he now found to be as lively and enter|taining, as his figure had been pre-engaging; and an involuntary &s;igh &s;oon convinced her; that he had made no &s;mall impre&s;&s;ion on her.</P>
<P>Mr. Harri&s;on, her former hu&s;band, was a plodding cit old enough to have been her father; it was a match of intere&s;t, and very di&s;agreeable to her: &s;he therefore re&s;olved to plea&s;e her&s;elf in a &s;econd mate.</P>
<P>Mrs. Harri&s;on's partiality for Frank was &s;oon di&s;|covered by her relations, who &s;trenuou&s;ly di&s;&s;uaded
<PB N="241" REF="032707_0240_0FF433D4E8734D08">
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> from the match; pointing him out as a rake and &s;p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">d thrift, who would ruin her; and that &s;he would have the pungent mortification of finding her fortune tran&s;ferred to harlots and &s;harpers. But the&s;e remon|&s;trances had little or no effect; &s;he was re&s;olved to have him, her vanity prompting her to believe her charms and attractions were &s;ufficient to reclaim a rake, let him be ever &s;o abandoned. In this pre&s;umption &s;he li&s;tened to his addre&s;&s;es, and, in a &s;hort time gave him her hand; but not before &s;he had prudently &s;ettled his whole fortune upon her&s;elf.</P>
<P>The honey moon had &s;carce clap&s;ed, before &s;he was &s;en&s;ible of his coolne&s;s. He was frequently ab&s;ent from home all night; and, when he returned, &s;eemed to have forgot that Mrs. Gaylove was his wife&punc; Stung to the quick at this behaviour, &s;he re&s;olved to trace his haunts, and di&s;cover what happy female had &s;upplan|ted her in his affections. It was not long before one of his emi&s;&s;aries pur&s;ued him from the chocolate hou&s;e to the apartments of a celebrated Thais, in the new build|ings. This intelligence was immediately communica|ted to Mrs. Gaylove, who in&s;tantly took a coach, and repaired to the &s;cene of infidelity, where having in|quired for Mi&s;s Shep&mdash;d, &s;he gained admittance, and ru&s;hed up &s;tairs, threw open the dining room door, when &s;he detected her perfidious hu&s;band, in amorous dalliance with his mi&s;tre&s;s. His &s;word was hung up, and every circum&s;tance tended to te&s;tify that he propo|&s;ed taking up his quarters there that night.</P>
<P>Mrs. Gaylove's remon&s;trances to Mi&s;s Shep&mdash;d, were doubtle&s;s pretty &s;evere upon the occa&s;ion; but
<PB N="242" REF="032707_0241_0FF433A1268A7480">
could no way equal the emba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">&s;&s;ment and di&s;traction Gaylove.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner had Mrs. Gaylove returned home, than &s;he packed up all her clothes, with what belonged to her, and repaired to a relation, with whom &s;he remained till &s;uch time as &s;he could obtain proper apartments for her&s;elf, leaving upon the table the following mortifying billet.</P>
<P>"Ungrateful wretch! adieu for ever! From this moment I take a final farewell, and leave you to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">upport of your generous mi&s;tre&s;s, upon whom you have, doubtle&s;s, lavi&s;hed &s;ums that were my property, and which will, certainly, entitle you, from her gene|ro&s;ity and gratitude, to make a &s;uitable provi&s;ion for you."</P>
<P>Upon Frank's return, finding the &s;ituation of affairs, he was almo&s;t frantic&mdash;he inquired of the &s;ervants whither their mi&s;tre&s;s had flown. The only an&s;wer he could obtain was, that &s;he had paid them their wages, and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed them.</P>
<P>In this &s;ituation he di&s;po&s;ed of the hou&s;hold furni|ture, the produce of which &s;upported him for &s;ome time.

<P><HI>Horten&s;ia Melmoth,</HI> the heroine of this hi&s;tory, was the daughter of Sir Cecil Melmoth, a man who&s;e high|e&s;t ambition was to be reckoned the leader of the <HI>beau monde</HI> in all the fa&s;hionable pur&s;uits of plea&s;ure, &s;o that it was almo&s;t proverbial when any thing particularly elegant appeared, to &s;ay, "this is quite in Sir Cecil's &s;tile:" his fortune was large, and he had a heart &s;en|&s;ible of the mo&s;t delicate feelings; generous, and good natured to a fault: ble&s;&s;ed with a wife in whom every virtue, every grace was concentered, to render the &s;tate of matrimony as perfectly happy as that of our primi|tive parents before their fall; yet had &s;he none of that rigid &s;ternne&s;s, which &s;o many hypocrites affect, and call it virtue. No, &s;he was all that was lively, gay, and debonair, would enter freely into mo&s;t of the modi&s;h amu&s;ements, dre&s;s elegantly according to the ta&s;te of the times, and often, to plea&s;e her hu&s;band, would even lead them.</P>
<P>One would imagine that nothing could now exceed Sir Cecil's felicity; happy in a woman's love with whom (after being &s;atiated with a continual round of di&s;&s;ipation) he could pa&s;s his hours in &s;ocial conver&s;e, with &s;uch heartfelt &s;atisfaction, that, were it to be made known to the world even in idea, it would be the means of dome&s;ticating half the popinjays of the age. Flattered in his favorite foible of having the polite cir|cles implicitly following him thro all the mazes of plea|&s;ure; and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a fortune ample enough to &s;up|ply him in his darling pa&s;&s;ion without the lea&s;t difficul|ty;

had not that bane of &s;ociety, that di&s;turber of connu|bial tranquility GAMING, gained an a&s;cendency over him, amid&s;t the other follies of the day, and without which, it would be impo&s;&s;ible for him to pre&s;erve that high rank, as a man of the <HI>ton,</HI> which he had taken &s;uch pains to acquire, he mu&s;t have been as happy as this mundane &s;tate would admit. The con&s;equence was, he fell a dupe to the de&s;igns of knighted pick pockets, and ennobled &s;harpers, who, according to their de|&s;erts, &s;hould have a cord in&s;tead of a ribbon. Sure there never was a truer &s;aying in regard to gaming than that of the French poet, "On commence par etre dupe, et on fi nit par etre fripon." His repeated and heavy lo&s;&s;es brought a gloom upon his temper to which he was heretofore a &s;tranger; and his brea&s;t, which u&s;ed to be the man&s;ion of plea&s;antry, was now the &s;eat of angui&s;h.

At length his frenzy &s;ub&s;ided, and he was &s;eized with a &s;ettled melancholy that &s;eemed likely to la&s;t his life. In this &s;tate he continued about &s;even years; when, unexpectedly, by the death of a di&s;tant relation, a fortune much larger than his former devolv|ed to him&mdash;his fir&s;t care was to place his children in a more eligible &s;ituation than they were at pre&s;ent, as they had been till now under the care of the nur&s;e who had reared them from their tender infancy. His mel|ancholy decrea&s;ed imperceptibly, and he once more returned to gaiety and plea&s;ure; yet he took care to avoin gaming of every &s;pecies. He bought a large hou&s;e in Portland-place, and engaged a tutor for his &s;on; his daughter he placed at an eminent boarding &s;chool near Londnn; where in&s;tead of that &s;trict regard being paid to the morals, and proper care taken to implant
