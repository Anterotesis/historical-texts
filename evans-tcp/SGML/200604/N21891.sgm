<HEAD>THE HISTORY OF CONSTANTIUS &amp; PULCHERA.</HEAD>
<P>IN the &s;uburbs of the city of Philadelphia, in the &s;oft &s;ea&s;on of the year, about one o'clock, on a moon &s;hining morning, on the terrace of an high building, forty feet from the ground, appeared a mo&s;t beautiful lady of the age of &s;ixteen&mdash;&s;he was clad in a long white ve&s;t, her hair of a beautiful che&s;nut colour, hang|ing carele&s;sly over her &s;houlders; every mark of great|ne&s;s was vi&s;ible in her countenance, which was over|ca&s;t with a &s;olemn gloom, and now and then, the un|willing tear, unnoticed, rolled down her cheek.</P>
<P>She ca&s;t her eyes around, taking a &s;urvey of the garden below, and the places adjacent&mdash;a fixed melan|choly, apparently, increa&s;ed on her countenance, and now and then the big &s;igh would bur&s;t from her la|bouring bo&s;om&mdash;more than once &s;he attempted to re|turn into the chamber from which &s;he had made her appearance&mdash;and then would appear unre&s;olved. At length, taking a chair, and &s;eating her&s;elf near the &s;ide of the terrace, and after a few moments of expre&s;|&s;ive &s;ilence, &s;he thus uttered her&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="028832_0004_0FDD5CB9777B9148">"O cruel fortune! O more cruel parent!&mdash;when &s;hall I again behold my adorable CONSTANTIUS? but why do I mention him? why do I recall his loved ideas? He is gone,&mdash;I am bani&s;hed forever from him, cloi&s;tered up in this unble&s;&s;ed man&s;ion&mdash;debarred from him, for who&s;e &s;ake only I could wi&s;h to live!&mdash;But I mu&s;t deface his memory.&mdash;O for one draught from the river Lethe, that the tender feelings of my di&s;|tracted bo&s;om might no more be harrowed up by his recollection! Alas! vain is the wi&s;h; the impre&s;&s;ion on my heart is &s;o deep, that it cannot be defaced but by annihilation!&mdash;Can I ever eradicate from my mind his lovely features, his charming di&s;po&s;ition, his fine &s;en&s;e, with all his fini&s;hed accompli&s;hments! No, &s;ooner than that could be the ca&s;e, the adamant would vegetate. All impo&s;&s;ibilities will become practicable, &s;ooner than I could forget that &s;tood of tran&s;port with which I &s;urrendered my heart to him, and took deliv|ery of his in exchange, and called on Heaven to regi&s;|ter the indi&s;&s;oluble contract.</P>
<P>Oh! the effu&s;ion of extacy of that happy moment, the &s;oft remembrance of which &s;erves no other pur|po&s;e than to plant daggers in my di&s;tracted bo&s;om. Why &s;hould a father be lo&s;t to every tender feeling, and tear me in&s;tantaneou&s;ly from the &s;ummit of hap|pine&s;s, and place me in the <HI>focus</HI> of torment!&mdash;"never more to &s;ee him!" The cruelle&s;t accents which ever were uttered by one who is totally unworthy the name of "<HI>father!</HI>" Has he a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated him? or has he procured his manumi&s;&s;ion to &s;ome foreign barbarous land? O could I but once more &s;ee him, though it were but ju&s;t long enough to bid him a final farewell&mdash; O could I but have the &s;atisfaction of taking my leave of him, though it were in the agonies of death; how would I wa&s;h his mangled limbs with tears, and ki&s;s

the departing &s;oul from his quivering lips! How would my &s;oul bur&s;t through the &s;hackles of its clay tenement, and bear him company through the unex|plored regions of Ely&s;ium! but in vain the wi&s;h.&mdash; But what doth my eyes &s;ee pa&s;&s;ing through the moon &s;hade of the garden? It is my dear, loved CON|STANTIUS, or his &s;pirit returned from the Ely&s;ian fields! But hark, I hear his foot&s;teps, it is he, and not his &s;pirit&mdash;Once more have my optic nerves re|animated my almo&s;t de&s;erted body&mdash;CONSTAN|TIUS! CONSTANTIUS! once more your PULCHE|RA beholds you; my eyes are enchanted at the pro&s;|pect, though bars of iron hold me from your embra|ces! Three bolted doors &s;ecure me from you&mdash;yet I behold you, and never more will I complain of ad|ver&s;e fortune, if I can but expire before you are taken from my view, dear CONSTANTIUS! CONSTAN|TIUS!" He lifted up his eyes and beheld her&mdash;with the &s;tronge&s;t emotions of elevated joy, he exclaimed, "my dear PULCHERA, it is enough! once more I do behold the object to which in my mind I had given a final adieu!&mdash;driven from your arms by a father, who till the fatal moment had expre&s;&s;ed his approba|tion of me in the mo&s;t flattering terms, with a ferocity which I never before believed human nature capable of, he drove me from his hou&s;e, after having torn from me the delight of my eyes, and the ravi&s;her of my heart&mdash;tell me, my deare&s;t PULCHERA, what was the cau&s;e of this &s;trange alteration of conduct in him, whom once I thought worthy to be called your father."</P>
<P>The di&s;tre&s;&s;ed PULCHERA replied,&mdash;"Ambition! cruel ambition is the cau&s;e of our misfortune&mdash;no man was ever better plea&s;ed with another than my father was with you, until Mon&s;ieur <HI>Le Monte,</HI> only &s;on and
<PB N="8" REF="028832_0006_0FDD5CBF604E4380">
heir to a rich nobleman in France, waited on him, and offered to make me his wife, giving a mo&s;t in|chanting de&s;cription of the honours and pomp he would advance me to&mdash;the temptation was too great for him to with&s;tand&mdash;the anticipations of tin&s;elled greatne&s;s took the full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his &s;oul&mdash;he prom|i&s;ed Mon&s;ieur that I &s;hould be his&mdash;he &s;oon informed me of my de&s;tination, and I could &s;ee joy &s;parkling in his eyes when he reflected on the good fortune to which he fondly imagined my good &s;tars had de&s;tined me.&mdash;In vain did I remon&s;trate to him, that by his own voluntary con&s;ent I had formed an indi&s;&s;oluble union with my deare&s;t CONSTANTIUS, and that love had cemented us beyond the power of &s;eparation; and while I was going on with my mo&s;t pathetic lamenta|tion for his conduct, your approach interrupted me&mdash; a degree of rancour, which till then I &s;uppo&s;ed him totally incapable of, appeared in his vi&s;age, and your own recollection will furni&s;h you with ideas of his conduct, until he drove you from the garden in which we were, and gave you the &s;olemn a&s;&s;urances you never &s;hould &s;ee me more.</P>
<P>He then &s;ecured me in the chamber communicating with the terrace, on which you &s;ee me forty feet high; and tomorrow I am to embark for France, in a pack|et, lying in the river, with Mon&s;ieur, to be his for|ever"&mdash;Here her voice failed her, and &s;he almo&s;t di&s;&s;olved in a flood of tears. CONSTANTIUS was on the rack at this fatal intelligence&mdash;in de&s;pair he drew his &s;word, and was on the eve of falling on its point, thereby putting a period to an exi&s;tence which he no longer could con&s;ider as a ble&s;&s;ing; but fortune, which always favours the virtuous, &s;ugge&s;ted to his mind a tow line he that day had ob&s;erved in his &s;tore, which had been left there by accident&mdash;he cries out, PUL|CHERA,
<PB N="9" REF="028832_0007_0FDD5CC361C57648">
be contented a few moments, and I will re|lieve you. So running to his &s;tore, which &s;tood not far di&s;tant, he takes the tow line, and la&s;hing three oars at the end of each other, made the rope fa&s;t to the end of them. He by this means reached the rope to PULCHERA, who di&s;engaged it from the oar, made it fa&s;t to one of the banni&s;ters of the ter|race, by which means &s;he de&s;cended, tho' the knot by which &s;he made the rope fa&s;t, &s;lipped before &s;he had got to the ground, yet &s;he was &s;o near it that &s;he received no material damage thereby. Never, perhaps, was joy more triumphant than on this occa&s;ion: he &s;traitway conveyed her to his chamber, where the remainder of the night was &s;pent in a far more agreeable manner, than the former part thereof had been.</P>
<P>Never was there, perhaps, a greater tran&s;ition from doleful anticipations to real joy, than had been expe|rienced by PULCHERA; for nothing could be more di&s;tre&s;&s;ing to her than the idea of being forever &s;eparat|ed from CONSTANTIUS; to be forced by cruel pa|rental authority from her home, her friends, and from every plea&s;ing pro&s;pect, into a foreign land, and there to be &s;hackled for life to a man to whom &s;he had the mo&s;t fixed and irrever&s;able aver&s;ion, and from whom &s;he had no other conceivable way to e&s;cape than through the avenue of death; thus circum&s;tanced, to be in a manner bordering on the invi&s;ible world, and dive&s;ted of all her fearful apprehen&s;ions, at the &s;ame time to find her&s;elf in the full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of him who was dearer to her than all things el&s;e, was well nigh too hard for her. They &s;carcely had fini&s;hed their reciprocal congratulations, when the clock adverti&s;ed them that two hours of the la&s;t half of the night was expended, when CONSTANTIUS informed her that her &s;afety required her to be put in &s;ome place more
<PB N="10" REF="028832_0008_0FDD5CC49D4C5DC0">
&s;ecure from the re&s;earches of her father, who would doubtle&s;s make the mo&s;t vigorous efforts to recover her. This piece of information gave a mo&s;t &s;urpri&s;|ing &s;hock to PULCHERA, who till that moment had con&s;idered her&s;elf in the mo&s;t perfect &s;ecurity; vari|ous &s;chemes of &s;afety were propo&s;ed by each of them, not one of which on examination proved admi&s;&s;ible; at length the dawn of day approaching, nece&s;&s;ity obliged them to leave their pre&s;ent place of retreat, and conclude on &s;ome place of &s;ecurity after their de|parture from the haven.</P>
<P>In this determination they quitted the chamber, hand in hand through the meadows, while invention &s;upplied the place of conver&s;ation until they wandered down the banks of the Delaware &s;ome miles; when on &s;ome occa&s;ion PULCHERA being a few rods be|hind, CONSTANTIUS, as ju&s;t entering a &s;hort turn of the bank, was &s;eized by half a dozen armed men, who hurried him on board of a boat. PULCHERA, by the means of the feeble rays of light which were retained by the atmo&s;phere, had a dim pro&s;pect of this tran&s;action; and altho what &s;he e&s;teemed as her <HI>&s;um|mum bonum</HI> was torn from her, yet &s;o &s;udden was the on&s;et, and &s;o complete the &s;urprize, that it &s;ummoned all the tender and fearful feelings which female nature is &s;u&s;ceptible of; and PULCHERA retired behind the oppo&s;ite declivity of the bank, out of the pro&s;pect of the &s;cene, and &s;ecure from their view. Dreadful were the &s;en&s;ations which &s;he here experienced; her apprehen&s;ions of per&s;onal danger being at la&s;t in &s;ome mea&s;ure abated, the &s;afety of CONSTANTIUS in the next in&s;tance occupied her di&s;tracted bo&s;om; &s;he bur&s;t into a flood of tears, and exclaimed, "Oh! heavens, where is he! what have they done with him! he is gone! he is gone! never more &s;hall my wretched eyes
<PB N="11" REF="028832_0009_0FDD5CC62F96E068">
behold him! he has fallen a prey to relentle&s;s <HI>Briti&s;h barbarity!</HI> he mu&s;t expire in &s;ome loath&s;ome pri&s;on|&s;hip, or give up the gho&s;t in &s;ome forlorn, death-im|pregnated dungeon, without a friendly hand to clo&s;e his eyes when they are dimmed by death! Why did my cowardly fears prevail on me to leave him? Why did I not like a true lover (as I thought I was) pre&s;s forward to him, and have been a partner in his mis|fortunes? Had I been worthy the name of a lover, I &s;hould have done it; but I was a &s;tranger to love, tho' I profe&s;&s;ed it, and now I am ju&s;tly left to &s;uffer tor|ments greater than would be probable on any circum|&s;tances where he was pre&s;ent. But can I not yet get to him?&mdash;She ran to the bank of the river, where &s;he was &s;eized by the party, but nothing of him or his captors could be di&s;covered&mdash;Frantic in de&s;pair, &s;he beat her brea&s;t, tore her hair, cur&s;ed her fate, and prayed for annihilation, and was ju&s;t about commit|ting her body to the watery grave, when &s;he was pre|vented therefrom by her father's taking hold of her arm.</P>
<P>The con&s;ternation &s;he was now in is more ea&s;ily conjectured than de&s;cribed&mdash;Her father, unacquainted with what had happened to CONSTANTIUS, any further than he gathered from the exclamations of PULCHERA, &s;uffered her to &s;tay there no longer, but in&s;tantly conducted her home, and confined her to an inner chamber, leaving her to the reflections of her own mind, where &s;leep and comfort were equally &s;trangers to her.</P>
<P>The next day her father entered her chamber in a plea&s;ant air, inquiring after her health, and &s;aying a a variety of plea&s;ant things to her, taking no notice of her late elopement: &mdash; At length, in &s;oft accents, he ob&s;erved to her that this was the day on which <HI>M. Le
<PB N="12" REF="028832_0010_0FDD5CCA1A9CF530">
Monte</HI> had propo&s;ed to embark with her for his native country, in order to make her his wife; and that all he waited for was to be informed of her readine&s;s to attend him. Her father was about to proceed, but was interrupted by PULCHERA, who thus acco&s;ted him, "Dear father, the obligation of paternal autho|rity, and the duty of filial obedience, are among&s;t the fir&s;t ideas which took place in my mind; and with &s;uch forcible le&s;&s;ons have tho&s;e duties been inculcated on my mind, that nothing will ever be able to deface them; and I &s;hall make it my fir&s;t bu&s;ine&s;s, as long as I re|tain a rational exi&s;tence, to practi&s;e the one, and &s;ub|mit cheerfully to the other. But, dear and re&s;pected father, the barely naming of <HI>M. Le Monte</HI> to me, under my circum&s;tances, cannot fail of giving me &s;en|&s;ations, wor&s;e than the mo&s;t &s;tudied torture of the <HI>Wheel</HI> and <HI>Rack</HI>: But was I at my own di&s;po&s;al, you, Sir, could command nothing which I could he&s;itate at obeying! but I am not my own.&mdash;At your &s;pecial leave and reque&s;t, I have, in a mo&s;t &s;olemn manner, given up my&s;elf to CONSTANTIUS, and am no more my own&mdash;he took full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my heart when I gave him my promi&s;e, and I have neither power nor inclination to take it back. You, Sir, was pre&s;ent, and ratified our contract by your mo&s;t explicit appro|bation thereof; and therefore cea&s;e to po&s;&s;e&s;s the right or power of di&s;po&s;ing of me again: Pray, dear Sir, give the&s;e con&s;iderations that weight which they de|&s;erve: remember that I am under the mo&s;t &s;olemn obligations to my dear CONSTANTIUS, that heaven has recognized it, and that a violation thereof would involve me in the horrid &s;in of perjury, which would eventually deprive me of every &s;pecies of peace here, and procure endle&s;s mi&s;ery to me hereafter. Con&s;ider al&s;o, I pray Sir, that <HI>Le Monte</HI> is as odious to me as
<PB N="13" REF="028832_0011_0FDD5CCB5CF25AC8">
CONSTANTIUS is agreeable&mdash;that his temper and di&s;po&s;ition is naturally fierce and cruel to the la&s;t de|gree&mdash;that it is one of the articles of his religion, that "no faith is to be kept with hereticks," and &s;uch, you are &s;en&s;ible, he e&s;teems me&mdash;that he de&s;pi&s;eth that holy religion, who&s;e principles, in my early infancy, you have taught me to have the highe&s;t regard for, as being in&s;eparably connected with my future welfare. I hope you will reflect &s;uitably on the&s;e things, and not let the idea of the pomp and &s;how of tin&s;eled greatne&s;s, and the place near a Monarch's court, in|duce you to de&s;troy the pre&s;ent peace and future wel|fare of your only child."</P>
<P>Her father li&s;tened to what &s;he &s;aid until &s;he had gone through; when, with a &s;tern a&s;pect, he replied, "Poor &s;illy creature, your folly would be your utter ruin, had you not a father living to bridle your giddy pa&s;&s;ions: but to rea&s;on with a per&s;on void of ration|ality is no part of my bu&s;ine&s;s. Remember you are under my government, and that my will is your law&mdash; that nothing will be able to divert me from my pur|po&s;e of having Le Monte for a &s;on in law, and you may as well &s;ubmit to my plea&s;ure quietly, as to be dragged to it by force, which will be the ca&s;e if you prove refractory. As to your CONSTANTIUS, he is a man who&s;e fortune does not exceed that to which you are born; but Le Monte has an inexhau&s;tible fund, both of riches and honour." Thus &s;aying, be left her to her own doleful reflections. Sleeple&s;s and weari&s;ome moments were her companions until the next morning, when a &s;ervant of the family entered the room, informing her it was her father's plea&s;ure that &s;he &s;hould prepare her&s;elf to breakfa&s;t with <HI>Le Monte</HI> and him&s;elf; at which he left the room throw|ing into her lap a new&s;paper of that day. She took
<PB N="14" REF="028832_0012_0FDD5CCF54BE8048">
up the paper, and the fir&s;t thing &s;he e&s;pied therein, was the fatal intelligence that CONSTANTIUS, after he had been taken pri&s;oner by the Briti&s;h, proved &s;o franticly refractory, that in a fit of rage one of the of|ficers had &s;heathed his &s;word in his heart, and he was dead!&mdash;At the reading of which, poor PULCHERA &s;wooned away, and fell on the floor; the noi&s;e of which brought the &s;ervant again into the apartment, for, by his ma&s;ter's order, he had waited at the door to ob&s;erve her. He, &s;eeing her in that condition, called up the family, and a long time it was before they could re&s;tore her to her &s;en&s;es; and when at la&s;t it was effected, with eyes &s;tarting with horror, &s;he ex|claimed, "He is gone! He is gone! CONSTAN|TIUS is no more! Had it not been for my cruel fa|ther, he would &s;till have been alive and with me; but untimely death hath clo&s;ed his eyes; and you, Oh! my father, mu&s;t be an&s;werable for that and all its con|&s;equences! But you &s;hall be di&s;appointed; never will I be <HI>Le Monte's</HI>; if I am deprived of him in life, I will &s;till be his in death; he has my heart, and I will never give it to another. I will de&s;cend to the grave! I will retire from the theatre of this world, which has no longer any thing in it to allure me, and will &s;eek that peace, in the unexplored regions of futurity, of which I am deprived here by a relentle&s;s father."</P>
<P>To no purpo&s;e did her father attempt to rea&s;on with her, telling her, that as CONSTANTIUS was dead, &s;he was ab&s;olved from all her obligations&mdash;that &s;he, in con&s;equence thereof, was again under parental di&s;po|&s;al&mdash;that now &s;he had no excu&s;e of duty to CON|STANTIUS&mdash;that <HI>that</HI> religion which &s;he the day before &s;poke &s;o highly of, made it her duty now to &s;ubmit to the dictates of her father, and that if &s;he refu&s;ed, &s;he mu&s;t lo&s;e his ble&s;&s;ing and her own peace
<PB N="15" REF="028832_0013_0FDD5CD09E608CE0">
con&s;cience here, and be &s;ure of the indignation of her Maker and Judge hereafter; and that for her to con|tinue ob&s;tinate would be of no &s;ervice to her, as &s;he was totally in his power, and that he was fully deter|mined &s;he &s;hould, that very night approaching, em|bark with <HI>Le Monte.</HI> She ob&s;erved to him, that to urge the death of CONSTANTIUS as an argument for her again coming under his di&s;po&s;al, when at the &s;ame time he was in reality the guilty cau&s;e of it, did not carry any great matter of force with it, and that it was enough for him to deprive her of CONSTANTIUS, without adding a cur&s;e of little le&s;s magnitude to her misfortune; for the joining her to <HI>Le Monte</HI> would add as much to her wretchedne&s;s as the depriving her of CONSTANTIUS.</P>
<P>Her father, finding that expo&s;tulation had no kind of effect upon her, withdrew, to prepare for her em|barkation; and the evening following forced her into a coach, which conveyed her in the cour&s;e of the night to the wharf where lay the &s;hip in which <HI>Le Monte</HI> was to return to France, waiting for her arrival. She was hurried on board&mdash;and the wind being fa|vourable, they hoi&s;ted &s;ail, and in a few hours lo&s;t fight of the American &s;nore. Grief, amazement and horror occupied the brea&s;t of PULCHERA, though <HI>Le Monte</HI> u&s;ed every effort to recommend him&s;elf to her; but all to no purpo&s;e. She replied to him, that it was in vain for him to attempt what was totally im|po&s;&s;ible&mdash;that her aver&s;ion to him was &s;o great, that time and circum&s;tances would never be able to efface it&mdash;that though he had the power over her body, yet her mind was, and &s;hould continue, free&mdash;that &s;he never would give him her hand or heart, and that he might re&s;t a&s;&s;ured he would never have the &s;atisfaction of being her hu&s;band&mdash;that even the crown of France
<PB N="16" REF="028832_0014_0FDD5CD4D69AED20">
was too trifling a toy to have any effect on her mind. In di&s;cour&s;es like this they pa&s;&s;ed a tedious pa&s;&s;age of thirty one days, when one morning the light pre&s;ented to their view three Briti&s;h &s;hips at not more than half a league's di&s;tance, at the leeward of them: a flight was impo&s;&s;ible, and in a few minutes the neare&s;t of the Briti&s;h &s;hips fired a &s;hot acro&s;s their bow. The Cap|tain of the French &s;hip called his officers together, and held a momentary council of war, the re&s;ult of which was to &s;trike their colours, and yield them&s;elves pri&s;|oners of war; which was done immediately.</P>
<P>The Captain and &s;ome of his principal officers, to|gether with <HI>Le Monte</HI> and PULCHERA, were carried on board the Commandant's &s;hip; but what was the &s;urprize of PULCHERA, when on board of the captor &s;he beheld her lo&s;t CONSTANTIUS! Nor were the &s;en&s;ations of CONSTANTIUS le&s;s nervous at behold|ing his adorable PULCHERA &mdash;they both &s;tood &s;ilent, &s;wallowed up in extacy, while their expre&s;&s;ive counte|nances declared the emotions of their hearts more in|telligibly than the mo&s;t fini&s;hed compo&s;ition of words is capable of doing.</P>
<P>The Captain of the Briti&s;h &s;hip, on ob&s;erving what pa&s;&s;ed, took PULCHERA into his cabin, &s;aying, "Fair lady, by the &s;ilent me&s;&s;ages which have pa&s;&s;ed between you and CONSTANTIUS, a pri&s;oner in my &s;hip, I fancy you have had &s;ome former acquaintance with him, and that by &s;ome means he has been forced from you&punc; and your meeting appears to be unexpected to both; be &s;o good as to inform me of the circum|&s;tances, as far as may be proper: you are both in my power; I will &s;ee you have ample ju&s;tice done you." PULCHERA then went on to inform him that &s;he was the only daughter of a rich farmer in the neighbour|hood of Philadelphia&mdash;that her father had paid every
<PB N="17" REF="028832_0015_0FDD5CD5DFAA5E78">
attention to her education&mdash;that at the age of &s;even|teen her father informed her that for three years pa&s;t he had made it the whole of his &s;tudy to devi&s;e means of recommending her to the only &s;on of a wealthy merchant in the &s;ame neighbourhood, who&s;e name he &s;aid was CONSTANTIUS; and that CONSTANTIUS and his father had both agreed to the match, and that he hoped there would be no objections on her part&mdash; that with blu&s;hes &s;he told her father &s;he had no ob|jection to offer to &s;uch a propo&s;al&mdash;that &s;he had long had a &s;trong prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion in favour of CONSTAN|TIUS; in fine, &s;he proceeded to give him a brief hi&s;to|ry of the tran&s;actions which we have before related, until the then pre&s;ent moment.</P>
<P>The Captain, at the end of the narration, called CONSTANTIUS into the cabin, &s;aying to him, "You have hitherto been a pri&s;oner in my &s;hip&mdash;you from this moment cea&s;e to be one&mdash;you are henceforth at liberty, and have the freedom of the &s;hip; I congratu|late you on your fortunate meeting with your admired PULCHERA&mdash;an elegant &s;tateroom &s;hall be allotted for your u&s;e&mdash;you and PULCHERA &s;hall henceforth participate at my table, and when we arrive at Port&s;|mouth, I will take &s;uitable care of you: you &s;hall have a &s;afe conveyance to Holland, from whence at your lei&s;ure you may return to your native coun|try." CONSTANTIUS politely returned him his warme&s;t thanks for his offered goodne&s;s, and noth|ing but harmony &s;ub&s;i&s;ted in the cabin.</P>
<P><HI>Le Monte,</HI> who continued a pri&s;oner on board the &s;ame &s;hip, in a few days was informed of all that had taken place with regard to CONSTANTIUS and PULCHERA, and was &s;tung with re&s;entment at the information, and &s;wore revenge. The next day he &s;ent CONSTANTIUS a challenge to a duel, which
<PB N="18" REF="028832_0016_0FDD5CD9ED886328">
he accepted; and that night met for the purpo&s;e; in the i&s;&s;ue of which <HI>Le Monte</HI> fell, and had to a&s;k his life of CONSTANTIUS, who magnanimou&s;ly gave it to him.</P>
<P><HI>Le Monte</HI> was &s;o &s;en&s;ible of his obligation to CONSTANTIUS, that he ro&s;e and expre&s;&s;ed his warme&s;t acknowledgments to him on the occa&s;ion; adding, that after experiencing &s;uch a favour from him, he had too much gratitude to do any thing which could in any degree prove di&s;agreeable to him:&mdash;"I therefore," &s;aid he, "do relinqui&s;h every idea of any claim to the admirable PULCHE|RA&mdash;I re&s;ign her to you, &s;ir&mdash;your conduct has rendered you worthy of her who has not an equal on earth. May you long live mutual ble&s;&s;ings to each other, and may a beneficent Providence grant that you may forever be &s;harers of the be&s;t of ble&s;&s;ings which heaven has re&s;erved in &s;tore for its deare&s;t favourites; and may I hope, notwith&s;tanding all which has pa&s;&s;ed, that <HI>Le Monte</HI> will be record|ed among&s;t the number of your friends."</P>
<P>Nothing could exceed the courte&s;y with which CONSTANTIUS and PULCHERA treated <HI>Le Monte</HI> on this occa&s;ion; and the remainder of the voyage was &s;pent in the mo&s;t agreeable manner, until one night, after a mo&s;t beautifully &s;erene day, they &s;aw a prodigiou&s;ly black cloud make its appearance in the we&s;tern hemi&s;phere, which was &s;o hurried on by a terrific gale, that in twenty minutes time it total|ly ob&s;cured the whole face of the heavens, and in|volved them in one &s;olid ma&s;s of &s;ub&s;tantial dark|ne&s;s, while the wind continued to rage with the wild madne&s;s of the mo&s;t violent hurricane, &s;o that the greate&s;t &s;kill and exertions of the officers and mariners became nece&s;&s;ary to prevent their being
<PB N="19" REF="028832_0017_0FDD5CDB206AC848">
totally ingulphed in the bottom of the great deep. What added to their frightful &s;ituation was, that after it had continued without any mitigation for the &s;pace of about two hours, their ears were &s;alut|ed with the &s;ound of di&s;tant thunder, which every moment, with a&s;toni&s;hing rapidity, approached nearer and nearer to their a&s;toni&s;hed ob&s;ervation, until their &s;hip, by the fla&s;hes of lightning, &s;eem|ed to be wrapped in &s;heets of fire, which were ac|companied by &s;uch dreadful peals of thunder as in|dicated that the final di&s;&s;olution of univer&s;al nature was fa&s;t approaching, while torrents of rain, as though the flood gates of heaven were un&s;topped, fell upon them with &s;uch impetuo&s;ity as was &s;uffi|cient (one would have thought) to have over|whelmed them in inevitable de&s;truction.</P>
<P>While in this pitiable &s;ituation, being the &s;port of the enraged elements, at one moment to&s;&s;ed up to the clouds, at the next immerged into the bottom of the convul&s;ed deep, expecting every moment to be the la&s;t; when nothing but fruitle&s;s cries and lamentations were to be heard between tho&s;e amaz|ing peals of thunder which kept almo&s;t con&s;tantly bur&s;ting over their devoted heads; in the tenth hour of this de&s;perate condition, they felt the &s;hock of the ve&s;&s;el's &s;triking on a bar. This was but a com|pletion of their de&s;pair. The Captain, however, ordered the longboat to be thrown out, that any who cho&s;e it might take their chance in it, as it was more than probable that the next &s;ea would beat the &s;hip to pieces, and bury tho&s;e in the &s;and who remained on board; neither was the pro&s;pect of venturing in the boat any more favourable, as it was bordering hard on impo&s;&s;ible for a boat to &s;tand it for two minutes. It was at this time that CON|STANTIUS

and PULCHERA, who till then had kept hold of each other's hands, by &s;ome means &s;epa|rated; and in a few minutes PULCHERA di&s;cover|ed, through the medium of the lightning, that &s;he was the only per&s;on remaining on board. This circum&s;tance, di&s;tre&s;&s;ing as it was, could add but little to her wretchedne&s;s, which before was com|plete; &s;he &s;tood &s;till, and re&s;igned her&s;elf to fate. It was not long before &s;he perceived that the beat|ing of the &s;eas had made a fatal inroad on the &s;hip, which threatened every moment to come to pieces&mdash; which in about five or &s;ix hours took place.</P>
<P>PULCHERA, who was almo&s;t in a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of thought, found her&s;elf floating on one of the hatch|es, on which &s;he was &s;oon wa&s;hed upon the beach. The di&s;con&s;olate PULCHERA, with the &s;mall re|mains of &s;trength &s;he yet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, was ju&s;t able to avoid the fury of the &s;ucceeding wave, which, if &s;he had not e&s;caped, could not have failed of prov|ing fatal to her. When &s;he found her&s;elf beyond the reach of the boi&s;terous &s;urges, &s;he reclined her|&s;elf again&s;t the declivity of a bank, where &s;he &s;at to bemoan her di&s;a&s;terous fate: wearine&s;s overcame her, and &s;he fell into a &s;leep. When &s;he awoke, &s;he found that the &s;torm had &s;ub&s;ided, the boi&s;terous wind had &s;unk into a perfect calm, the &s;ky was clear, the air was &s;erene, the face of nature appear|ed &s;miling, the birds on the boughs filled the air with their melody, the &s;un &s;hone with peculiar lu&s;tre, and every appearance &s;eemed calculated to in&s;pire the bo&s;om with plea&s;ing &s;en&s;ations; but all the&s;e circum&s;tances had no delights for PULCHERA &mdash;a fixed gloom occupied her countenance, and the mo&s;t melancholy &s;en&s;ations rent her di&s;tre&s;&s;ed brea&s;t&punc; &s;he wandered, making an u&s;ele&s;s moan to the heed|le&s;s

flowers which decorated the wanton &s;oil over which &s;he rambled. Hours after hours in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion pa&s;&s;ed away, while &s;he traver&s;ed the &s;hore, where lay in forlorn ruins the &s;hattered remains of the &s;hip; but no &s;igns of any of the people, dead or alive, were to be found.</P>
<P>In un&s;ucce&s;sful re&s;earches &s;he &s;pent the day, in the cour&s;e of which &s;he found &s;he was on a &s;mall i&s;land, which, though under cultivation, was de&s;|titute of inhabitants. The night &s;ucceeded the day which &s;he pa&s;&s;ed in a manner not le&s;s joyle&s;s than the day before had been; but on the return of day, ju&s;t after bright Phoebus had ri&s;en from his orient bed, &s;he di&s;covered a ve&s;&s;el coming down from the northward. As good fortune would have it, &s;he came within call of the &s;hore; &s;he therefore, with a voice as loud as her enfeebled &s;ituation would ad|mit, hailed them; and being a&s;ked what &s;he de&s;ir|ed, &s;he an&s;wered, that &s;he was the only &s;urvivor from a &s;hip lately ca&s;t away there in a &s;torm, and wi&s;hed to come on board. The Captain ordered his boat to bring her on board his ve&s;&s;el, which was done accordingly. This ve&s;&s;el proved to be an American privateer, fitted out from a port in France, the Captain being M&mdash;, of New York, with whom PULCHERA had formerly had a &s;light acquaintance, and knowing him to be a gentleman of &s;trict honour, &s;he informed him of the whole of her adventure. Capt. M&mdash;was very much af|fected with her &s;tory, but with no part of it more than with the haple&s;s fate of his friend CONSTAN|TIUS, with whom he had been bread at &s;chool, and for whom he entertained the greate&s;t regard; and nothing in Capt. M&mdash;'s power was left une&s;|&s;ayed to render PULCHERA happy; and &s;he expe|rienced

every mark of di&s;tinction, as well from all the officers as the Captain and &s;eamen, which their &s;ituation would admit of.</P>
<P>Capt. M&mdash; informed her that after a few days crui&s;e in tho&s;e parts, they were bound to America, and on their arrival there it &s;hould be &s;ome of his fir&s;t bu&s;ine&s;s to &s;ee her conducted &s;afely to her friends; and in a few days they &s;at out to put this purpo&s;e into effect. Nothing material happened the fir&s;t ten days&mdash;but on the eleventh day, they found they were cha&s;ed by a ve&s;&s;el of &s;uperior force, and that &s;he gained con&s;iderably upon them&mdash;and it was &s;oon made certain that &s;he was a ve&s;&s;el of more than twice their force, con&s;equently a capture (extraor|dinaries excepted) was unavoidable. Capt. M&mdash; advi&s;ed PULCHERA, in order to e&s;cape any ill u&s;age from their captors, to dive&s;t her&s;elf of wo|men's apparel, and attire her&s;elf in a &s;uit of his, which &s;he accordingly did, putting on a neat &s;uit of red regimentals, a gold laced hat, and a &s;word by her &s;ide, and took upon her the character of a Lieutenant under the name of VALORUS. By this time their pur&s;uer was within reach of them, which was announced by the di&s;charge of one of her bow guns. Capt. M&mdash;, on a more particular in&s;pec|tion of his enemy, began to conceive &s;ome hope of being able to make good his defence again&s;t them: he accordingly made ready for an engagement, which &s;oon commenced with great fury on both &s;ides. In a few moment the combatants were at not more than &s;ixty feet di&s;tance, while an ince&s;&s;ant di&s;charge of cannon, many of which were loaded with langrage and grape &s;hot, was &s;ufficient to have effectually tried the fortitude of the olde&s;t veterans; and for a very con&s;iderable time fortune

&s;eemed undetermined in who&s;e favour to decide, until a well directed fire from the Briti&s;h, cau&s;ed Capt. M&mdash; to &s;trike his colours, and thereby de|cided the action. The captor put a prize ma&s;ter on board of the prize, taking the officers (among whom was VALORUS, under the character of a lieutenant) into his own ve&s;&s;el.</P>
<P>The captor proved to be a &s;loop of war from Port&s;mouth, bound to Quebeck. Capt. M&mdash; and his officers received as good treatment on board the &s;loop as could rea&s;onably be expected from the hands of a captor; in particular the delicate appearance of VALORUS in&s;ured to her an uncommon degree of re&s;pect from the under officers and men&mdash;&s;he kept her countenance as &s;mooth as the unruffled &s;ea, tho' at the &s;ame time her recollection of CONSTANTIUS totally de&s;troyed every agreeable idea which was about to ri&s;e in her mind, though none but her pil|low was a witne&s;s to her immoderate grief on the occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>They pur&s;ued their voyage for Quebeck, where the pri&s;oners had the promi&s;e of being liberated, they giving their parole not to enter into actual &s;ervice again&s;t the Briti&s;h, until regularly exchang|ed. But how fickle is fortune! When they &s;uppo&s;|ed, by their reckoning, they were near in with the land, a terrible &s;torm a&s;&s;ailed them, which continu|ed without intermi&s;&s;ion day after day, the wind rather increa&s;ing than dimini&s;hing, till on the night of the third day after the commencement of the &s;torm; when, about one o'clock, they were alarm|ed by the breaking of the &s;ea but a very &s;mall di&s;|tance before them; a &s;ure indication that a bar, &s;hoal, rocks, or land, was there, and &s;o nigh was it, that all attempts to avoid it were made u&s;e of in

vain; they had &s;carcely time to realize their &s;itua|tion before their ve&s;&s;el was a ground&mdash;their fate was apparently fixed&punc; and their &s;mall remains of hope &s;eemed to be totally annihilated. But this &s;u&s;pen&s;e la&s;ted not long; the wind was &s;o violent and the &s;eas &s;o enormous&punc; that the fourth &s;ea after &s;he fir&s;t &s;truck, reduced her to a heap of ruins, and the hands, by the violence of the waves, were wa&s;hed on the &s;hore, which was but a few feet di&s;tant from the bow of the ve&s;&s;el, and they had the &s;urpri&s;ing good fortune to e&s;cape a watery tomb, &s;aving three only, who were drowned. They endeavoured to &s;eek a &s;helter from the &s;torm by advancing up on the land; but all attempts of this nature were in vain; for, twenty feet from the water was the far|the&s;t they could extend, by rea&s;on of a bank which a&s;cended nearly perpendicular, and the &s;tate of the night was &s;o dark that they could form no idea of its height; and as they traver&s;ed to the right hand and the left, they found it was not to be avoided either way, as at a &s;hort di&s;tance it butted down into the water, and they found they mu&s;t con|tent them&s;elves in that &s;ituation until morning; but they were overwhelmed by one very melancholy con&s;ideration, viz. that they were ignorant of what time of tide it was; if it &s;hould happen to be any thing near low water, they could not po&s;&s;ibly avoid being &s;wallowed up long before it was high water: however, it &s;o happened that at the time of their being ca&s;t a&s;hore, it was high water, and by keep|ing a con&s;tant ob&s;ervation they &s;oon found that the tide was on the ebb, which &s;oon ea&s;ed them from their di&s;mal apprehen&s;ions on that account. The night, however, pa&s;&s;ed away in a very joyle&s;s man|ner. When the daylight appeared, the &s;torm &s;till
<PB N="25" REF="028832_0023_0FDEB33FFA52ADE8">
continuing <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> very plea&s;ing pro&s;pect pre&s;ented it&s;elf to their view.</P>
<P>The beach on which they were, was about thirty rods in length, bounded by an in&s;urmountable ledge of rocks, to the height of one hundred and fifty feet, which butted at each extremity into the &s;ea, the ends of which they in vain attempted to double; their boats they found cru&s;hed in ruins with the remains of their &s;hip.&mdash;Providentially, among the rubbi&s;h they found con&s;iderable quantities of provi&s;ions: but, un|fortunately, no kind of tools larger than a jack-knife could they obtain, though the mo&s;t diligent &s;earches were made therefore&mdash;They bu&s;ied them&s;elves in &s;e|curing their provi&s;ion, by carrying it above the reach of the tide. They then &s;ecured a few barrels of am|munition which they found undamaged, and &s;ome fire arms. Fruitle&s;s attempts were then made to a&s;cend the precipice, until experience had taught them that nothing was to be expected from their mo&s;t vigorous exertions.</P>
<P>Having &s;ecured the whole of the provi&s;ions they could find among the ruinous remains of their &s;hip, they began to collect materials for building a raft, and immediately began to erect one, though this bu&s;i|ne&s;s went on very &s;lowly for the want of tools proper to execute it with&mdash;however, they did as well as they could, and in the cour&s;e of two or three days, by their exertions, they had fabricated one &s;ufficient to float the whole of the unhappy &s;ufferers, on board of which the next morning they embarked with a part of their provi&s;ions, their fire arms, and a quantity of ammu|nition; with this they pu&s;hed off from the &s;hore, the weather being very cold, and the heavens indicated the approach of a &s;torm.</P>
<P>It was a que&s;tion at fir&s;t which way they &s;hould di|rect
<PB N="26" REF="028832_0024_0FDEB3423B5E1AD8">
their cour&s;e&mdash;at la&s;t it was agreed to crui&s;e along &s;hore, to the ea&s;tward. They pro&s;ecuted this inten|tion, at about three, and &s;ometimes four rods di&s;tance from the &s;hore, for five or &s;ix miles, while nothing appeared to them to favour their wi&s;hes&mdash;nothing but a perpendicular ledge of ragged rocks was to be &s;een; and by this time the &s;now began gently to de&s;cend.</P>
<P>They kept a con&s;tant look out for a place where it was po&s;&s;ible for them to run their raft a&s;hore, where they might encamp on dry land; but this they long &s;ought for in vain, till towards evening, when the &s;now had fallen to the depth of twelve or thirteen inches, they di&s;covered a &s;mall declivity in the bank, where they run their raft on &s;hore. And through this declivity they a&s;cended the bank, which was about one hundred feet in length.</P>
<P>When they had attained the &s;ummit, they had an exten&s;ive uncultivated plain in pur&s;uit, and not the lea&s;t &s;ign that any thing human was ever there before them.</P>
<P>With &s;ome difficulty in collecting materials, they built them a comfortable fire, and frying a quantity of bread and meat, they &s;oon ate a very hearty &s;up|per; by this time it being dark, they made prepara|tions for taking &s;ome repo&s;e.</P>
<P>In the morning they awoke and beheld a &s;erene air, and a plea&s;ant &s;ky&mdash;they con&s;ulted what cour&s;e they &s;hould then take, when it was agreed that they &s;hould divide into a number of &s;mall companies, each com|pany to take a different route, taking a quantity of provi&s;ions each, and if either party found any inhabit|ants, to return to that place and wait for the return of the re&s;t.</P>
<P>VALORUS, with two others, compo&s;ed one of tho&s;e &s;mall companies, each taking a gun, a quantity of
<PB N="27" REF="028832_0025_0FDEB345CE9D0B08">
ammunition and provi&s;ions; they each took their differ|ent <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">, the &s;now being about &s;ix inches deep. They employed them&s;elves, the fir&s;t day, in exploring the inho&s;pitable wilderne&s;s, without meeting with any thing worthy of remark.</P>
<P>On the latter part of the &s;econd day, they were o|vertaken by a furious &s;torm of &s;now. They travelled till almo&s;t night, and &s;eeing no kind of probability of finding any inhabitants, they concluded to &s;top under the leeward &s;ide of a large rock, and make as good preparations for the en&s;uing night as they could, which was only to tread down the &s;now, and collect &s;uch fu|el as they could, to &s;upport a fire. The &s;torm contin|ued to rage with uncommon fury during the whole of the night, and the &s;ucceeding day, during which time, it was with the greate&s;t difficulty they kept them&s;elves from freezing, their fuel being exhau&s;ted, and it was with the greate&s;t difficulty that they procured a &s;mall quantity more. They found, at the abatement of the &s;now, that it had fallen to the immoderate depth of four or five feet, and by rea&s;on of its not being capa|ble of &s;u&s;taining half the weight of a man, it was en|tirely impo&s;&s;ible for them to proceed either backward or forward.</P>
<P>In this &s;ituation, all they could do, was to make them&s;elves as comfortable as their dreary circum&s;tan|ces would permit. The weather was &s;o inten&s;ely cold, that a large fire was indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary; and though they were &s;urrounded with timber, they lack|ed the means of procuring it; however, they collected the &s;mall remains of wood which they had, and after incredible pains, they beat a track to an old dry oak tree, at about a rod's di&s;tance from them, and kindled a fire in a fracture at the bottom thereof, by which means in le&s;s than two hours they burned it down,
<PB N="28" REF="028832_0026_0FDEB3476A20E980">
which providentially falling acro&s;s the rock, broke, and &s;plit the main trunk to pieces; this was a very valuable acqui&s;ition, making as much as two cords and a half of wood. This la&s;ted them for better than three days, when their &s;ituation &s;eemed to arrive at the height of wretchedne&s;s; the rigour of the weather not having in any degree abated, and the &s;mall &s;tore of provi&s;ions they had brought with them being &s;pent, there &s;eemed nothing but inevitable death before their eyes; for although a &s;econd attempt &s;imilar to the fir&s;t had furni&s;hed them with a con&s;iderable &s;tock of wood, yet, with nothing el&s;e to &s;u&s;tain nature, death could not appear at a very great di&s;tance from them, e&s;pecially, as their natural &s;trength, by exce&s;&s;ive exer|tions, the inclemency of the weather, the &s;evere hard|&s;hips, and want of food, was greatly debilitated.</P>
<P>In this &s;ituation they lived, or rather exi&s;ted, for &s;ix days, having no kind of &s;u&s;tenance, excepting the bark of trees, which, as it was frozen, they could get off only in &s;mall pieces with their knives, and then, thawing it by the fire, chewed and &s;wallowed it.</P>
<P>At the commencement of the &s;eventh day, when their &s;ufferings had reduced them to a &s;urpri&s;ing &s;tate of weakne&s;s, and it was become certain that they could exi&s;t but a very little time longer, they began to wreck their invention to determine what they &s;hould do next. In vain did they then lament that they had not, as &s;oon as the &s;torm had abated, attempt|ted to have forced through the &s;now a way back to their rendezvous, though the pro&s;pect was very un|promi&s;ing, it being, by the be&s;t of judgment, nearly fifty miles; but it was now too late to think of an at|tempt like that; and after mutually condoling each other on their de&s;perate &s;ituation, one of the party thus addre&s;&s;ed his partners: <HI>Dear Fellow Sufferers,</HI>

In our &s;ad &s;ituation, a few hours more will clo&s;e our eyes, to be opened no more; we now cea&s;e to be any advantage to each other; and though life is hard to part with, yet it is of little con&s;equence whether we die to day or to-morrow; and if <HI>one</HI> dying to day will eventually &s;ave the life of the <HI>two &s;urvivors,</HI> one had better die alone for the other two to live, than for all three to die together.

Thank God, you may yet live!" and di&s;charged his piece at the bear, lodging two balls in his head, of which he died in&s;tantly.&mdash;If ever joy was to exce&s;s, it was then &s;o among&s;t this little unfortunate company&mdash;VAL|ORUS, whom they both loved equal to them&s;elves, was &s;till alive&mdash;without going to their prey, they both fell upon him, embracing him as one from the dead, and the mo&s;t tender, expre&s;&s;ive congratula|tions pa&s;&s;ed on the occa&s;ion&mdash;they all &s;eemed lo&s;t in extacy for &s;ome &s;pace of time.</P>

<P>It is needle&s;s to recount the weari&s;ome &s;teps which they experienced on their journey; &s;uffice it to &s;ay, that on the fifth day, ju&s;t before night, they arrived at the place exceedingly fatigued, which they found in the &s;ame &s;ituation they had left it, and no &s;igns were to be di&s;covered that intimated any per|&s;on's having been there &s;ince their departure; but it was &s;o near the windward &s;ide of the land, that the wind, in the time of the falling of the &s;now, had driven the &s;now quite off from that place.</P>
<P>Fatigued as they were, they built a fire, and pro|vided &s;ome &s;upper:&mdash;Here they found bread, pork, beef, tea, &s;ugar, and &s;ome cooking uten&s;ils, which they had left there; and they prepared and ate a more comfortable meal than they had &s;ince their being ca&s;t away. The next day they had recour&s;e to their raft, which they found inclo&s;ed with ice;&mdash; they then repaired on the ice to the place of their &s;hipwreck, which they likewi&s;e found the &s;now drifted off from. Tired of any further re&s;earches, they con&s;ulted which was the be&s;t place to fix their abode at; and when they had con&s;idered, that at this place was the greater part of the provi&s;ions they had to depend on&mdash;that here, from the ruins of their &s;hip, they could obtain materials for build|ing

them a &s;helter&mdash;and that likewi&s;e, here they could procure fuel from the &s;ame re&s;ource&mdash;they unanimou&s;ly agreed to make that the place of their re&s;idence, hoping they had provi&s;ions enough to carry them through the winter, and that in the &s;pring, Providence would find &s;ome way for their deliverance.</P>
<P>Under the impre&s;&s;ion of the&s;e ideas they went to work, and fabricated them&s;elves a hut, tolerably warm; and to add to their good fortune, among&s;t the ruins of the &s;hip they found a ca&s;k of Jamaica Rum, and another of Brandy, and about eight thou&s;and nine hundred pounds in ca&s;h, though <HI>that</HI> they looked on as a very &s;mall acqui&s;ition, but they &s;ecured it. In this &s;ituation they con&s;idered them&s;elves tolerably happy; but a misfortune now attacked them which they were in no mea&s;ure pre|pared for. VALORUS and one of his companions were taken &s;ick of a pleuri&s;y; this deadly di&s;order &s;eized them &s;o violently, that in three days both of their lives were de&s;paired of by them&s;elves and their companion, who left nothing unattempted, which he had rea&s;on to hope would contribute to their recovery. There was nothing but what the unfortunate two underwent, both from the extreme raging of their di&s;temper, and al&s;o from the forlorn &s;ituation which they were unfortunately in; how|ever, contrary to their own and their companion's expectations, on the eighth day the fever broke, and by &s;low degrees they regained their wonted &s;trength, &s;o that in about five weeks they were able to walk about, and were in a good mea&s;ure able to do &s;uch kind of bu&s;ine&s;s as their circum&s;tances re|quired to be done. They now pa&s;&s;ed their time as agreeably as could be expected for people in &s;uch

lonely circum&s;tances, &s;aving only the di&s;con&s;olate VALORUS, who as her thoughts began to be le&s;s taken up on her own per&s;onal &s;afety, the idea of her beloved CONSTANTIUS would keep continu|ally ari&s;ing in her di&s;tracted mind. The horrors of that dreadful night wherein they parted by &s;hip|wreck, to meet no more, would keep continually harrowing up her mind, and depriving her of every &s;pecies of comfort&mdash;her mind was di&s;tracted with terrific dreams, and her days &s;pent in melancholy reflections. At times &s;he was half re&s;olved to un|bo&s;om her&s;elf to her comrades; but rea&s;ons of policy forbid the mea&s;ure.&mdash;They &s;till &s;uppo&s;ed VALORUS to be what he appeared to be&mdash;a man.</P>
<P>In this &s;ituation they &s;pent their time, until the return of &s;pring, at which time their provi&s;ion was nearly exhau&s;ted; when one morning, to their in|expre&s;&s;ible &s;atisfaction, they e&s;pied a &s;mall ve&s;&s;el, not more than a league and an half from &s;hore. They made u&s;e of every means in their power to give them notice of their &s;ituation, by firing guns of di&s;tre&s;s, which at la&s;t had the de&s;ired effect, and the ve&s;&s;el &s;tood in for the &s;hore, until they got with|in call, when they hailed them, and a&s;ked them what they wi&s;hed. They gave them a &s;hort account of their di&s;a&s;ter, and that in all probability they were the only &s;urvivors of a large crew. The ve&s;&s;el &s;ent their boat a &s;hore and took them on board She proved to be a privateer from a port of E&s;&s;ex county, in Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts &s;tate.&mdash;VALORUS did not think proper to make known his &s;ex, though he in|formed them he was an American, and that he was a pri&s;oner when he had the misfortune to be &s;hip|wrecked. The captain of the privateer told VAL|ORUS, if he would enter on board voluntarily, he
<PB N="35" REF="028832_0033_0FDEB3644A2411C0">
&s;hould be entitled out of the dead &s;hares to a lieu|tenant's proportion of the prize money; the hands on board having agreed thereto, he accepted the appointment&mdash;as for the other two, it was agreed that they &s;hould be &s;et at liberty the fir&s;t opportu|nity that pre&s;ented.</P>
<P>They crui&s;ed on this coa&s;t about a week, when they fell in with and took a brigantine, from Bri&s;tol bound to Quebec, with a very valuable cargo on board. The captain of the privateer put VALORUS on board prize ma&s;ter, with a &s;ufficiency of hands, and ordered her into Salem; but unfortunately the next day &s;he was captured by a forcible Briti&s;h crui&s;er, and was carried into Halifax. VALORUS had, through unacquaintedne&s;s with this kind of bu&s;ine&s;s, left the papers which he had of the captain of the privateer; and when the captor demanded his papers, he had nothing to &s;hew. In vain did VALORUS inform him of the whole tran&s;action. The captain of the crui&s;er &s;aid any one might make as good a &s;tory as that&mdash;he accordingly put VAL|ORUS in irons, and when they arrived at Halifax (perceiving that the irons hurt his wri&s;ts, they were taken off) he was put into the dungeon, and there kept in order for a trial for piracy.</P>
<L>"Unhappy nymph, who thus art forc'd to roam,</L>
<L>"Without a kind protector, friend or home."</L>
<P>Tho&s;e who are acquainted with Halifax, know that the provo&s;t, under which the dungeon is &s;itu|ated, &s;tands on a ri&s;ing piece of ground, and that from a vault in the bottom of the dungeon there is a drain of about two feet &s;quare, which leads from the &s;aid vault out to the &s;ide of the hill on which the provo&s;t &s;tands. After VALORUS had been con|fined
<PB N="36" REF="028832_0034_0FDEB366F58C9670">
in this place about ten days (the eleventh be|ing appointed for their trial) he got acquainted with this circum&s;tance of the drain; he therefore, in company with &s;ome others, determined to make their e&s;cape through that avenue: they therefore, one by one, let them&s;elves down into the vault, and crept out through the drain on their hands and knees, it being about half filled up with filth; how|ever, they lived through the operation, though it was nau&s;eous to the la&s;t degree; and they all got &s;afely through, though they were all in a filthy con|dition; in order to dive&s;t them&s;elves of this, they had immediate recour&s;e to the water, where they found a &s;mall &s;hallop, on board of which they en|tered, and under cover of the night got clear of the harbour: But their evil genius had not yet left them; for on the &s;econd day after their e&s;cape they were taken up by a &s;mall ve&s;&s;el of force, bound from Penob&s;cot to London; &s;o their plea&s;ing hopes of &s;eeing home were once more brought to nothing.</P>
<P>The captain of this little cutter, proved to be a ve|ry good natured &s;ort of a man, and VALORUS made it his bu&s;ine&s;s to enter as far into his good graces as po&s;&s;ible, and he had every &s;ucce&s;s he could wi&s;h for, and on their arrival at London, he &s;at VALORUS and the re&s;t of the pri&s;oners at liberty.</P>
<P>VALORUS now found the advantage of the money, which he had &s;aved out of the wreck, he having about two hundred guineas in his pockets which his captors had not taken from him: he procured him&s;elf a couple of &s;uits of genteel clothes, and in a few days had an opportunity to embark for Li&s;bon, and from thence in a few days more for France. When he arrived at France, his fir&s;t inquiry was, if any Americans were in that place, or not. As it happened there was pre|&s;ent
<PB N="37" REF="028832_0035_0FDEB3EFF5C142D0">
a French officer, who under&s;tood the Engli&s;h lan|guage tolerably well, who informed him that at the next door but one, there lodged an American gentle|man, who he believed was of a very con&s;iderable rank in life.</P>
<P>VALORUS &s;tepped to the door, and a&s;ked if he could have lodgings there, till an opportunity pre&s;ent|ed for him to &s;hip for America? He was an&s;wered in the affirmative, and entered the hou&s;e; he was conduc|ted into a parlour, where &s;at a gentleman reading a manu&s;cript: the gentleman ro&s;e to receive him, but how great was the a&s;toni&s;hment of VALORUS, when in the face of the gentleman, he recognized every fea|ture of the long (thought) lo&s;t CONSTANTIUS. At fir&s;t thought, VALORUS had like to have di&s;covered his &s;ex and per&s;on, by the mo&s;t pathetic acclamations; but a &s;econd thought forbid any thing like that: "<HI>Time and ab&s;ence cure the fonde&s;t love</HI>:" &s;o taking each other by the hand, they pa&s;&s;ed mutual and civil compliments, and each &s;eated him&s;elf. CONSTAN|TIUS ordered a bottle of wine and &s;ome gla&s;&s;es to be brought to them, and after drinking to each other, CONSTANTIUS inquired what part of America VALORUS was from? He informed him, he belonged to a privateer from Salem, that he was captured and carried into Halifax, from whence he made his e&s;cape, was again taken and carried into England, where he was liberated, and came to this place in order to &s;eek a pa&s;&s;age home. Ju&s;t as this di&s;cour&s;e happened, a French gentleman entered the parlour, whom VALO|RUS, at fir&s;t &s;ight, knew to be <HI>Le Monte,</HI> the fir&s;t cau&s;e of all her trouble; mutual compliments pa&s;&s;ed between CONSTANTIUS and <HI>Le Monte,</HI> and a mi&s;cellaneous di&s;cour&s;e pa&s;&s;ed away the time, until &s;upper was &s;erv|ed; VALORUS then propo&s;ed taking his lodging, and
<PB N="38" REF="028832_0036_0FDEB3F1A4D54E58">
was conducted to his bed; CONSTANTIUS and <HI>Le Monte</HI> afterwards repaired to their lodging, which was &s;eparated from that of VALORUS only by a parti|tion.</P>
<P>Sleep had in a great mea&s;ure departed from VAL|ORUS. He attended to the di&s;cour&s;e of CONSTAN|TIUS and <HI>Le Monte,</HI> after they had taken their beds. He found that the mo&s;t intimate friend&s;hip &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between them, and that a purpo&s;e of marriage was on foot between CONSTANTIUS and the only &s;i&s;ter of <HI>Le Monte,</HI> and that &s;he would be in town on the mor|row from Paris, and that in a &s;hort time the nuptials were to be celebrated. Confu&s;ion now took full po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed heart of the feigned VALORUS. She viewed her CONSTANTIUS as totally lo&s;t to her forever; now did &s;he cur&s;e her unfortunate &s;tars, and lamented the time &s;he e&s;caped the gaping liquid grave, and all the horrors of the di&s;con&s;olate i&s;land on which &s;he had been &s;hipwrecked; but mo&s;t of all, the ill fat|ed moment which again introduced her to the pre&s;ence of CONSTANTIUS.&mdash;De&s;pair and angui&s;h rent her heart through the tedious watches of the night, and her pillow was wet with the choice&s;t tears that ever flowed within the realms of France.</P>
<P>On the return of the morning, they all aro&s;e, and every preparation was making for the reception of the lady (<HI>Le Monte</HI>'s &s;i&s;ter.) Breakfa&s;t was at la&s;t bro't on the table; <HI>Le Monte,</HI> CONSTANTIUS and VAL|ORUS &s;at down. During breakfa&s;t time. VALORUS inquired of CONSTANTIUS what part of America he was from? He replied, from Philadelphia. Pray &s;ir, &s;aid he, did you ever have any acquaintance with a gen|tleman by the name of&mdash;? Yes, replied he, with a very expre&s;&s;ive countenance&mdash;Did you know a daughter of his by the name of PULCHERA? Yes,
<PB N="39" REF="028832_0037_0FDEB3F33422C570">
replied CONSTANTIUS, with a degree of melancholy vi&s;ibly blended in his once cheerful countenance. Why, continued CONSTANTIUS, was you ever ac|quainted with her? Some years ago, replied VAL|ORUS, I was very intimate in the family, and if I forget not, when I la&s;t knew the family, &s;he was the only &s;urviving child which her father had. Can you inform me if ever &s;he married, and whether &s;he is yet alive or not? This que&s;tion brought tears into the eyes of CONSTANTIUS, who, with a voice which be&s;poke the perturbation of his mind, replied&mdash;Poor PULCHERA, the ornament of her &s;ex, and the pride of human nature, is no more; &s;ome mi&s;under&s;tanding with her father, with regard to a propo&s;ed marriage, cau&s;ed her to leave her home and cro&s;s the Atlantic, in which voyage the ve&s;&s;el was wrecked, and the un|happy PULCHERA was the only per&s;on that was lo&s;t! His tears prevented him from proceeding any further, and VALORUS's feelings were too &s;en&s;ible to pro&s;e|cute the inquiry.</P>
<P>After breakfa&s;t, VALORUS a&s;ked CON|STANTIUS to take a walk with him in the garden. CONSTANTIUS rather declined, &s;ay|ing, he &s;hould be exceeding fond and proud of an interview, but it was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for him to make all the preparation he could, to receive &s;ome company of rank which would attend on him in the afternoon, in con&s;equence of which, Sir, &s;aid he, I dare &s;ay you will excu&s;e me. VALORUS replied, he had too much good nature to urge him to a mea&s;ure that was di&s;agreeable to him, and retired to his cham|ber, and wrote a letter to CONSTANTIUS, then wal|ked out to take a view of the town, giving the letter to a boy in the &s;treet, making a pre&s;ent to him of a gui|nea to &s;ecure the delivery of it to the lady of the hou&s;e where CONSTANTIUS boarded.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="028832_0038_0FDEB3F4B7CABAE8">In about half an hour CONSTANTIUS received the letter of the lady; he opened, and read the contents, which were as follows:

<P><PB N="42" REF="028832_0040_0FDEB3FD913AD3E0">CONSTANTIUS was thunder&s;truck at reading the&s;e lines, viewing the writing, he would exclaim&mdash;"It mu&s;t be &s;o&mdash;I am too well acquainted with the hand, to be capable of being impo&s;ed on. She is &s;till alive, and I am hers, and &s;he is mine. An indi&s;&s;oluble bond has united us together, which nothing but death is capable of di&s;&s;olving. O heavens! where is &s;he? I am on the <HI>rack</HI> till I behold her! Where is the po&s;t boy who delivered the letter?" &amp;c.</P>
<P>CONSTANTIUS went on in &s;uch like exclamations until <HI>Le Monte</HI> came in, to whom he read the letter. <HI>Le Monte</HI> was a little &s;truck at fir&s;t hearing it, but on con&s;idering the &s;ubject, he told CONSTANTIUS it was impo&s;&s;ible for it to be a reality, but it was a piece of impo&s;ition, contrived by &s;ome ill minded per&s;on, in order to break off his propo&s;ed marriage with his &s;i&s;ter; &s;aying, you know, you po&s;itively know, my CONSTANTIUS, that it is beyond the reach of po&s;&s;i|bilities for her to be alive. She did not leave the &s;hip with us, and it is not in the power even of credulou&s;|ne&s;s it&s;elf to form an idea of her e&s;caping. CON|STANTIUS &s;tood in amaze; at la&s;t he replied, "it mu&s;t be, you are in the right; it is impo&s;&s;ible &s;he &s;hould be alive; &s;he has long &s;ince paid the debt of nature, and is no more."</P>
<P>VALORUS continued to walk the &s;treets, wi&s;hing to know the effect which the letter had on the mind of CONSTANTIUS, not being able to form a judg|ment how his affections &s;tood towards PULCHERA; about noon he returns to the hou&s;e, clo&s;ely examining the looks of CONSTANTIUS, but could read nothing in his countenance for certain.&mdash;He then enters into a di&s;cour&s;e with him, in the cour&s;e of which he inquires of him how long &s;ince he was in Phila|delphia? He an&s;wered, about &s;ix or eight weeks.&mdash;

Was the father of PULCHERA alive when you left the place? He was&mdash;Was he much affected at the lo&s;s of his daughter? Exceedingly&mdash;it had like to have rained his &s;en&s;es. I think, when I was there la&s;t, continued VALORUS, a certain gentleman by the name of CONSTANTIUS was paying his addre&s;&s;es to PULCHERA. Do you know any thing with regard to him? CONSTANTIUS, with &s;ome tender emo|tions, replied, yes, I am the per&s;on. I was once happy in the love of the amiable PULCHERA; but cruel death, that interrupter of human felicity, forced her from me, and left me, incon&s;olably to bemoan her haple&s;s fate.</P>

of which I took this locket, having her picture &s;et in gold&mdash;this I have ever worn on my brea&s;t, and never &s;hall it be transferred to any other place.&mdash;O thou amiable PULCHERA! never will your image be era&s;ed from my memory&mdash;never &s;hall I forget the time when we exchanged mutual vows, and gave our|&s;elves up to each other, when joys extatic took full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of our enraptured brea&s;ts at anticipating &s;cenes of felicity, which we promi&s;ed our&s;elves, but which cruel fortune never de&s;igned we &s;hould realize &mdash;here CONSTANTIUS's utterance failed him&mdash; here he gave him&s;elf up to a flood of immoderate grief, and VALORUS could &s;carcely contain him&s;elf&mdash;at length, in broken accents, he thus acco&s;ted him:&mdash; "<HI>Dear Sir,</HI> I pray that you would moderate your grief, which can be of no &s;ervice to you&mdash;your &s;orrows can never reanimate PULCHERA; when death &s;epa|rates lovers, though it is impo&s;&s;ible entirely to forget, yet&punc; duty makes it nece&s;&s;ary to bani&s;h every idea, as far as is practicable&mdash;you may no doubt find another to &s;upply the place of PULCHERA." O! replied CON|STANTIUS, the&s;e are the reflections of a mind at ea&s;e&mdash; it is true I cannot reanimate the admirable PULCHE|RA&mdash;&s;he has bid farewell to all &s;ublunary things, but my veneration for her will never cea&s;e to exi&s;t, neither will it in any degree abate. It is true, I have &s;ought for relief in the arms of another, and &s;oon, very &s;oon are the nuptials to be celebrated; but there is nothing which can era&s;e that &s;upreme indi&s;&s;oluble affection which I have once for all placed on the inimitable PULCHERA: &s;he is no more!</P>
<P>Dear Sir, replied VALORUS, your affections were very &s;incere, and Providence will never admit of &s;uch virtues going unrewarded&mdash;it mu&s;t have in its &s;tore of beneficence &s;ome peculiar ble&s;&s;ing to be&s;tow upon
<PB N="45" REF="028832_0043_0FDEB4081545BD60">
you, and though I am no prophet, I will venture to predict that your days of &s;orrow are nearly at an end&mdash; &s;omething you have no idea of at pre&s;ent, will &s;oon o|pen upon you, which will in&s;pire you with &s;uch &s;en&s;|ations as you have a long time been a &s;tranger to.&mdash; I pray you to di&s;mi&s;s the &s;ubject, and a&s;k me no fur|ther que&s;tions on this matter which intere&s;ts me beyond your conception&mdash;whether ever you &s;ee me again or not, remember what I now &s;ay to you.&mdash;Saying this, he bid him adieu; and the mo&s;t earne&s;t entreaties of CONSTANTIUS could not prevail on him to tarry any longer with him&mdash;he walked away into the city, leaving CONSTANTIUS in amazement.</P>
<P>CONSTANTIUS employed his rea&s;oning powers to conclude what the &s;equel of this matter &s;hould be, and and from what VALORUS could obtain &s;uch informa|tion concerning him; various were his conjectures, although he could form no fixed idea in his own mind favouring the elucidation of this riddle which VAL|OROUS had put upon him&mdash;he walked into the hou&s;e, where he &s;at down and continued his rumination on this inexplicable adventure. While he was thus mu&s;|ing, there came in a boy, and, delivering him a letter, he immediately retired&mdash;he opened the letter, and read the proceeding contents:

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IF you will call at the &s;ign of the eagle, at half pa&s;t four preci&s;ely, you will hear of &s;ome|thing you very little expect, and which concerns you in the highe&s;t degree, after that, it will be too late.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>ADIEU.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER></P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="028832_0045_0FDEB40C521F9660">This &s;till &s;erved to increa&s;e his wonder&mdash;but he con&s;idered it as rather an unfortunate appointment on one account, as that was the time appointed for the arrival of <HI>Le Monte's</HI> &s;i&s;ter, whom he wi&s;hed to receive with all the re&s;pect po&s;&s;ible&mdash;he at one time would imagine it was a &s;tratagem of &s;ome enemy of his, in order to introduce a friend between him and his propo&s;ed bride, and then he would determine to pay no kind of attention to the me&s;&s;age; then again the anxiety of his mind would be &s;uch, that he re&s;ol|ved, let the event be what it would, he would at|tend the &s;ummons.</P>
<P>Accordingly, at a little pa&s;t four, he made prepa|rations to go, and at twenty five minutes &s;at out, but as he had left the door, he looked round and di&s;covered his propo&s;ed bride, approaching at &s;ome di&s;tance, attended with a very &s;plendid retinue, the &s;ight of which &s;taggered his re&s;olution of proceed|ing&mdash;it could not fail of &s;triking his mind mo&s;t powerfully, that if he ab&s;ented him&s;elf at this time, the lady would conceive &s;uch a di&s;like, at this want of re&s;pect, that &s;he would abandon him forever, and that he &s;hould draw upon him&s;elf the revenge of <HI>Le Monte,</HI> and all his connexions&mdash;however, his curio&s;ity was &s;o great, and his anxiety &s;o irre&s;i&s;ti|ble, that his determination to go overcame every con&s;ideration to the contrary. He therefore turned his face towards the eagle, and &s;uffered nothing to divert his &s;teps&mdash;he arrived at 29 minutes pa&s;t four; at the door he met a barber and a toilet woman going out. He a&s;ked the ho&s;te&s;s if there were any commands there for him? She an&s;wered, that in the chamber parlour was a young gentleman waiting for you, if your name is CONSTANTIUS: That is my name, re|plied he&mdash;&s;he &s;hewed him&punc; the way to the room,
<PB N="48" REF="028832_0046_0FDEB40E956C8EE0">
which he entered&mdash;but heavens, what a &s;urpri&s;e was he &s;eized with, when he, in&s;tead of a young gentle|man, found his eyes fixed on his adorable PULCHERA; decked in all the magnificence which the city of Bour|deaux could afford&mdash;&s;he ro&s;e in the mo&s;t graceful manner to receive him: &s;uch a &s;weetne&s;s was in her countenance, as could not fail of ravi&s;hing the heart of the mo&s;t &s;tupid beholder&mdash;her eyes acquired addi|tional lu&s;tre, as they met tho&s;e of her long wi&s;hed for CONSTANTIUS, who&s;e &s;urpri&s;e was &s;o great, that his organs of &s;peech were totally incapable (for a while) to perform their functions, while PULCHERA thus ad|dre&s;&s;ed him: <HI>Dear</HI> CONSTANTIUS, it is long &s;ince my heart has been totally in your po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and many and great have been the &s;ufferings which I have pa&s;&s;ed through for the &s;ake of him whom I have now the plea|&s;ure of beholding; and you Sir, and you <HI>only</HI> know whe|ther my &s;ufferings have been in vain or not&mdash;you Sir, know whether I am to be happy in your favour, or whether the &s;i&s;ter of <HI>Le Monte</HI> predominates in your affections. You, Sir, can decide on a que&s;tion which is of more con&s;equence to me, than the riches of both the Indies. My complete happine&s;s, and my in&s;u|perable mi&s;ery, are now &s;u&s;pended in the balance of your mind, and as one or the other &s;cale preponderates, will my fate be happy or mi&s;erable in the extreme&mdash;yet Sir do not mi&s;under&s;tand me, perhaps my language conveys ideas different from my intentions, notwith|&s;tanding the many terms I have made u&s;e of, I value your repo&s;e &s;o highly, that I never can wi&s;h you to do a thing di&s;agreeable to your&s;elf, in order to oblige me; and even an event like that, was I &s;en&s;ible of it, would only add to my torment&mdash;If Sir, I have po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of your heart, I &s;hall be thankful for your hand al&s;o; but to have the <HI>latter</HI> without the <HI>former,</HI> this
<PB N="49" REF="028832_0047_0FDEB415729B7D78">
is &s;o foreign from my wi&s;h, that it never can obtain my con&s;ent. I plead no contract, but leave you to the free determination of your affections."</P>
<P>CONSTANTIUS by this time had in &s;ome good de|gree recovered of his &s;urpri&s;e: he encircled her in his arms, and in accents of rapture exclaimed, "O tran|&s;cendently propitious heaven! thrice bountiful, inex|hau&s;tible, magnificent Providence! inexpre&s;&s;ibly be|nevolent and &s;uperlatively beneficent fates! the mo&s;t exalted language is more than infinitely too inexpre&s;|&s;ive to give an idea of the grateful &s;en&s;ations which occupy my brea&s;t, which is borne down with the grateful &s;en&s;e which I have of your inconceivable benediction towards me! I am arrived at the &s;ummit of human gratification&mdash;I am lo&s;t in extacy. O! ye powers Omni&s;cient, is this real, or the un&s;ub&s;tantial fabrick of an empty vi&s;ion? O tran&s;cendently be|neficent powers! 'tis no fiction, 'tis no reverie of an in&s;ane mind, for I am above being impo&s;ed on in this matter&mdash;I have her in my arms, the real, half adora|ble PULCHERA! propitious Providence has once more placed her in my embraces, and the freaks of wild fortune &s;hall never more &s;eparate me from the object of my delight. No, no, my adorable angel, my deare&s;t PULCHERA, you have the full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a heart totally incapable of di&s;&s;imulation or change. No&mdash;&s;ooner than I could withdraw my &s;upreme af|fection from you, and place it on another, &s;hall the cour&s;e of nature receive a total revolution, the &s;un &s;hall cea&s;e to communicate his light or heat, darkne&s;s &s;hall become the medium of di&s;cerning objects&mdash;be|lieve me, my deare&s;t PULCHERA, as &s;oon as my &s;mall affairs in France are &s;ettled, we will cro&s;s the Atlantic, we will revi&s;it the land of freedom&mdash;we will &s;olemnize the long wi&s;hed for marriage ceremo|nies,
<PB N="50" REF="028832_0048_0FDEB417D2A82368">
and we will live the remainder of our days in that felicity which we have &s;o long in vain &s;ought for."</P>
<P>In this way they exchanged a variety of mutual expre&s;&s;ions of the mo&s;t fond affections, until time had in&s;en&s;ibly introduced the &s;hades of the evening, when CONSTANTIUS again began to think of his appointment with the &s;i&s;ter of <HI>Le Monte.</HI> He men|tioned to PULCHERA the overtures which he had made to <HI>Le Monte</HI>'s &s;i&s;ter, in con&s;equence of his totally de&s;pair|ing of ever &s;eeing her again&mdash;that a &s;en&s;e of honour made it nece&s;&s;ary for him to repair to his lodg|ings, and to inform her of his &s;ituation, and to make as good terms with her as he could, and that he would &s;pend as little time on this matter, as the nature of the thing would admit of.</P>
<P>CONSTANTIUS then repaired to his place of abode, where he found <HI>Le Monte</HI> and his &s;i&s;ter waiting with anxiety for his return. On his arrival, joy &s;eemed to &s;parkle in their countenances, but rather decrea&s;|ed as they read in his vi&s;age that every thing was not right in his mind. However, CONSTANTIUS went through the u&s;ual formalities of welcoming the lady with a tolerable good grace, But he &s;oon called <HI>Le Monte</HI> a&s;ide, de&s;iring to &s;peak with him alone. "My dear friend, &s;aid he, we have long been in &s;trict friend&s;hip together, which I zealou&s;ly wi&s;h to cultivate and improve, and there is a mat|ter which lays with peculiar weight on my mind, about which I wi&s;h to a&s;k your advice: I hope you will give me your &s;entiments fully." "Speak on, quoth <HI>Le Monte</HI>; the be&s;t of my poor advice is al|ways at your &s;ervice, and you cannot lay a greater obligation upon me, than to command my be&s;t &s;er|vices." "For a con&s;iderable time (continued
<PB N="51" REF="028832_0049_0FDEB4195AE694D8">
CONSTANTIUS) you have been acquainted with my affairs; you was no &s;tranger to my trea<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters"> with PULCHERA, to the pa&s;&s;ion I had for her, and the &s;olemn obligations I was under to her: &s;ince her exit you have been fully let into the particulars of my negociations with your amiable &s;i&s;ter, and the length to which we have carried the matter&mdash;now, Sir, &s;uppo&s;ing that PULCHERA &s;hould prove to be &s;till alive, and &s;hould in&s;i&s;t on my fulfilling my engage|ments, what could you advi&s;e me to do, Sir? Pray, dear Sir, on the &s;acred bonds of friend&s;hip, by which we are cemented, give me your impartial o|pinion on the matter."</P>
<P>"What <HI>&s;hould you do!</HI>" replied <HI>Le Monte,</HI> "can there remain a doubt in your mind with regard to what you &s;hould do? I think it is impo&s;&s;ible there &s;hould&mdash;are you not a man of honour? Do not your engagements, your &s;olemn promi&s;es, lay with &s;ome degree of weight on your mind? Can you harbour an idea that you are at liberty to break through the &s;olemn and delicate obligations of a matrimonial contract? If you do, how can you an&s;wer it to your own con&s;cience, to the wronged lady who has plac|ed &s;o much confidence in you? Can you have the mo&s;t di&s;tant idea that you can make a &s;econd con|veyance of your&s;elf to one woman before you are di&s;charged from the other? Can you lawfully di&s;|po&s;e of any article, after you have conveyed away the whole of your title to it? If you cannot, I wi&s;h to be informed of the means by which you were di&s;|charged from your obligations to PULCHERA: Will you &s;ay, you &s;uppo&s;ed &s;he was dead? Is that &s;ufficient, think you? Can your own mi&s;take de|prive her of that right which &s;he had to you, in con&s;equence of your voluntary con|tract?
<PB N="52" REF="028832_0050_0FDEB3018021DBF8">
No&mdash;your good &s;en&s;e will forbid your harbouring &s;uch unworthy ideas. If PULCHERA is alive, in the name of common ju&s;tice, marry her: your engagements to my &s;i&s;ter mu&s;t, in the nature of things, be, on this implied condition that PULCHE|RA is no more; it was totally out of your power to make any other contract with her, whether that con|dition was <HI>expre&s;&s;ed</HI> or not.'</P>
<P>Well (&s;aid CONSTANTIUS) &s;trange as it may ap|pear, PULCHERA is yet alive! I have &s;een her&mdash;&s;he is now at the &s;ign of the Eagle! <HI>Le Monte</HI> inter|rupted him, &s;aying, "Then marry her, otherwi&s;e I &s;hould e&s;teem you as totally unworthy of any &s;hare in my friend&s;hip&mdash;you &s;eem to he&s;itate: I will call in my &s;i&s;ter&mdash;I will inform her of the circum&s;tances; and then, if &s;he will con&s;ent to marry you under this predicament, and rifle PULCHERA of that felicity which &s;he has hazarded her life to obtain, I &s;hall blu&s;h when I reflect that I was ever allied to her, and from henceforth will forever di&s;own her as a relation of mine. I will call her in and inform her, as I &s;ee by your countenance that your &s;entiments corre&s;pond with mine."</P>
<P><HI>Le Monte</HI> called in his &s;i&s;ter to them, and informed her of the whole affair; who, looking on CONSTAN|TIUS with a plea&s;ant and very wi&s;hful countenance, gave the following deci&s;ion in favour of CONSTAN|TIUS&mdash;a proof of female genero&s;ity and noblene&s;s of mind.</P>
<P>"Dear Sir, di&s;appointments were never agreeable to my nature, and I have often thought that I had the lea&s;t patience to bear with them of any mortal exi&s;ting&mdash;and I have not a &s;ingle doubt but my affec|tions are as &s;trong towards you as PULCHERA'S are; yet you are her's by right, and your after engagements
<PB N="53" REF="028832_0051_0FDEB42436A5D288">
to me, under the mi&s;taken idea of her being dead, cannot make her claim to you invalid. He&s;itate not, my dear CONSTANTIUS&mdash;fulfil your engagements to her; for you will totally forfeit every claim to my affections and e&s;teem, if you do not. You have my mo&s;t fervent prayers that you may continue long and la&s;ting ble&s;&s;ings to each other in the connubial &s;tate&mdash; &s;he will always be &s;ure of a peculiar place in my e&s;teem, for the good will I bear to you. I hope you will favour us by introducing her into our company this evening&mdash;it will afford me the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible plea|&s;ure, to be in any mea&s;ure in&s;trumental in conducing to her happine&s;s.</P>
<P>CONSTANTIUS returned her a very polite compli|ment, for her candid and amiable overture; expre&s;&s;|ing his wi&s;hes, that providence would furni&s;h her with an hu&s;band &s;uitable to her rank in life, and one that would be much more worthy of her than he could have the arrogance to pretend to be. He then, in company with <HI>Le Monte,</HI> waited on PULCHERA from the &s;ign of the eagle, and introduced her to the &s;i&s;ter of <HI>Le Monte,</HI> where the remainder of the evening was &s;pent in the greate&s;t conviviality, and nothing could exceed the plea&s;ing compliments which pa&s;&s;ed between tho&s;e two rival ladies.</P>
<P>CONSTANTIUS and PULCHERA, after this, made the greate&s;t di&s;patch po&s;&s;ible in their preparations for returning home; and in about a week's time they embarked accordingly, taking an affectionate farewell of <HI>Le Monte</HI> and his &s;i&s;ter; and, after a &s;hort and plea&s;ant pa&s;&s;age, they arrived &s;afely at Philadelphia, and on the &s;ame day repaired to her father's hou&s;e. The &s;hock was almo&s;t too great for her father's nerves&mdash;he embraced them both extatically, a&s;king a thou&s;and pardons for his mi&s;conduct towards them,
<PB N="54" REF="028832_0052_0FDEB425D03AA9C0">
and with tears of joy promi&s;ed to devote the remain|der of his days to the &s;ub&s;tantiating their happine&s;s.&mdash; About a week from this they joined their hands at the altar of Hymen, amid&s;t a croud of &s;pectators, who&s;e plea&s;ed countenances be&s;poke the inward joy of their hearts: and they now live the greate&s;t ornaments of the married &s;tate.</P>
