<HEAD>AN ORATION.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN I rise in presence of so esteemed an Au|dience, and on so important an occasion, I am struck with diffi|dence and fear; with diffidence of my own abilities to perform the task I have undertaken, and fear, lest, by an unsuccessful at|tempt, I may lessen myself in your esteem. But I am comforted by the reflection, that you, MY RESPECTED AUDIENCE, are gener|ous and candid; that you, in your judgment, will consider my youth and inexperience, and, in your hearts, will feel for the delicacy of my situation; a situation I would willingly have declined, were I not convinced, that, to suffer this our political birth day to pass uncelebrated, would indicate ingratitude for our national exist|ence, and the dearest rights we enjoy: for we have heretofore
<PB N="4" REF="035229_0003_10017DCB00E4C668">
been too negligent of this GREAT ANNIVERSARY; and, while our neighbours have been testifying their gratitude with the great|est exultation and joy, careless of our duty, we have sitten tamely idle, nor joined in the general festivity. But, this day, I trust, you come with hearts prepared to enter into the ceremonies of celebra|tion, and that every attempt, however small, to render the day more solemn, will meet your approbation. I may then expect your in|dulgence, when I come forward to address you upon an interesting subject; nor am I discouraged for that it has been frequently han|dled before, since I know the topic must always be pleasing: for, to the ears of freemen, nothing is more peculiarly grateful than to hear of the blessings, which flow from their Liberty and Indepen|dence. And my wishes will be fully answered, if, in treating these sublime points, I can bring to your minds sentiments, which will be pleasing and useful in the review.</P>
<P>LET me lead you to consider the situation of our ancestors. They ever were the enemies of Tyranny and Persecution; and when, to shun the devouring jaws of those monsters, they left their native country, they sought an asylum in the forests of America.
<PB N="5" REF="035229_0004_10017DCD2542AA70">
Those forests, by their labours and those of their posterity, have been changed to cultivated fields; and, instead of being the haunts of savages, are now the residence of a great and civilized people. But, even here, Oppression pursued them, and the same power, which at|tempted to rule their consciences, was desirous to possess an abso|lute sway over their lives and properties; while the same spirit, which dictated resistance to the one usurpation, excited resolution to oppose the other. The ties, which connected them, were broken by the unworthy treatment of the mother country, who continued to oppress her children, and, by every means, to excite their resent|ment, till the burden grew too heavy to be borne, and the sons of Columbia, by their united efforts, strove to evade the load. It was three and twenty years ago this day, that they, inspired with the energies of freedom, came forward; and, while they avowed the wrongs and injuries they had received, declared their rights and privileges to the world. Force was used against them; they prepar|ed for resistance; and, as the slaves of despotism must always shrink before the animated exertions of freemen, they were crowned with success. Yet the contest was long and bloody, and Liberty was not established, till many of her dearest sons had fallen in the field of
<PB N="6" REF="035229_0005_10017DCF4B96D7B8">
battle. I need not mention to you a WARREN or MONTGOME|RY, they "have received their fame," and will be sure of a place in the memory of every American. And their claim to our grati|tude is just, since every one feels the beneficial effects, which have resulted from their generous endeavours, and is cheered by the presence of FREEDOM, that was purchased with their blood. Nor, in such a contest, and such a cause, were the children of Ver|mont idle. Though few, they were hardy, and the boldness of their enterprizes drew from the enemy himself a confession of their valour. As the transition from the hunter to the war|rior is small, they were alike successful, in chasing the deer on their native mountains, and facing the enemy in the open field. They shared the dangers, and have participated in the fruits of vic|tory. Let me then meet your attention, while I endeavour to lay these fruits before you.</P>
<P>THE first, then, my esteemed Audience, was our existence as sovereign States. Before, we were in the humble situation of Col|onies, dependant on a foreign power, the slaves of a foreign master, and governed by his mercenary tools, who were ever ready to de|press
<PB N="7" REF="035229_0006_10017DD193A56758">
us and aggrandize themselves; while we were approaching fast to taxation and servitude. But now, the scene is changed. We have risen to be respectable on the list of nations; our ancient masters are desirous of our friendship; and the powers of the world are courting the commerce and alliance of America. She is inde|pendent of external assistance, and rich in resources. Her chil|dren are bound by their own authority and laws only; and will ever contribute with cheerfulness to the public support. The rul|ers, who govern them, so far from being arbitrary and infallible dictators, are the servants of the people, and to them responsible. They are bound to walk in the path of duty; and, so well are we convinced of the ambition and lust of power, inherent in hu|man nature that, we may be allowed to watch with eagle eyes over their conduct, and to notice their intentions. Nor is it re|pugnant to the confidence, we place in their abilities and integrity, consistent with the natural weakness of humanity. Let not the world, then, judge too harshly nor stigmatize with opprobrious names men, whose only anxiety is for the good of their country, and the welfare and peace of their posterity. The late long and sanguinary struggle is still fresh upon their minds; and, as love and
<PB N="8" REF="035229_0007_10016496257B90D8">
jealousy are coupled, they dread the loss of a blessing, which cost so much blood, and which tends so peculiarly to the prosperity and happiness of society.</P>
<P>THIS blessing is no less than LIBERTY, who descended from heaven to cheer the spirits of our drooping countrymen. She has since continued to bless them with her influence; and, under her auspices, this will still be a great and Independent nation. While she is cherished, no tyrant can enslave, no misfortunes subdue, and life with bondage will be a bitter portion. Without her all is dark and cheerless; the tears of misery fill up the measure of the day, and Death alone can discharge the draught. She only can make us happy. It is she, that warms every heart with generous ardour, and increases the natural love of one's country into the most sublime patriotism. It is she, that smiles on the labours of the husbandman, while she protects him from the oppression of the powerful. Nor does she neglect the poor; for he, who eats his morsel of bread in freedom, is more truly happy, than the cour|tier, who feeds on dainties and riots in luxury; but whose fate hangs suspended by a thread. The Goddess has been justly ador|ed
<PB N="9" REF="035229_0008_10017DD3C09E0520">
in every age and nation; and Genius, wherever it has been found, has made an offering at her shrine, while she was fondly acknowledged the parent of political felicity. She is nurse of the most noble sentiments, and inspires genius with the most generous emulation; while, in her presence, "subjection grows more light and poverty looks cheerful:" her altars are the hearts of freemen, from which her offerings are the true and genuine feelings of patriotism.</P>
<P>ANOTHER, and not the least happy, consequence of our im|portant revolution, was the excellent government, under which we now live. Framed by our wisest heads, when improved by the experience of tyranny, and the dread of anarchy, it rose to birth, admirable in its composition, and beneficial in its effects. As it participates in the chief virtues of all governments, while it rejects their errors, like gold purified from the dross, it becomes more beautiful to view. For, while it imbibes the firmness of a monar|chy, the wisdom of an aristocracy, and the freedom of a democra|cy, it equally guards against the tyranny of the one, the divided op|pression of the other, and the licentious fury of the last. The vi|per
<PB N="10" REF="035229_0009_10017DD5EC35FE40">
of rebellion had begun to rear its head, and to disturb our ears with its hissings, when UNION was found necessary to crush the serpent. The FEDERAL SISTERS, convinced of the necessity of concord for their mutual safety and defence, joined their hands, and pledged to each other their lives, their fortunes, and their sa|cred honour, to maintain the common cause, and defend their rights from violation. The chain, which connects them, has been strengthened by Time and brightened by Friendship. Their number and its links have been increased; and we may say, without pride, that the accessions have been to the glory and inter|est of all. On the one hand, the United States, by an increase of population, have acquired strength and respectability; and, by their unity, are freed from the horrors of division and domestic war. Their authority is now respected and obeyed&punc; on the moun|tains of Vermont, and the fertile banks of the Ohio; while their territory extends from Canada to Georgia, and from the Atlantic Ocean to the Lakes. On the other hand, this individual State, by her admission into their sacred society, has procured the friendship of the powers around her, who are now ready to assist her against foreign intruders, or those, who would disturb her domestic peace.
<PB N="11" REF="035229_0010_10017DD76F8FD3B8">
Hemmed around by her neighbours, she is benefited by their com|merce, and shares the blessings, which indulgent Heaven has divid|ed equally between them; and, while protected by the talons of the American Eagle, she will continue to increase and flourish, nor shall her growth be checked, save by the corroding hand of time.</P>
<P>To detail every particular benefit, you have received from this grateful change, would be too tedious and minute. But we can safely say, that no land on the globe is more marked by harmony and happiness, than that of Columbia. Her sons are hardy and rugged, unacquainted with destructive idleness and dissipation. Their arms are braced by Industry, and their hearts are warmed by Patriotism. Her riches are increased by their labours; and, in times of difficulty, they will fly with alacrity to her defence. Yes, they are industrious, brave, and animated with the spirits of their fathers. Her daughters are blooming and modest, the pride and boast of their country. Unspoiled by the refinements of luxu|ry, the dignity of their charms is heightened by the simplicity of their manners: and, till folly and extravagance shall take place of prudence, neatness, and sense, the AMERICAN FAIR will continue to be respected and admired by every heart of feeling and taste.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="035229_0011_10017D8BF9D45A10">
THESE, with many others, are the blessings you enjoy, in con|sequence of your happy situation. They are the gifts, the inesti|mable gifts of Heaven, bestowed upon you to make you happy and content. And it is your duty, your indispensable duty, to cherish them in your hearts, and to transmit them pure and undi|minished to your posterity; and, while you defend them from in|vasion from abroad, it is necessary you should seek the means of preserving them from decay at home. I shall now proceed to demonstrate these means of preservation.</P>
<P>IN the first place, let Education be considered, not only with a view of present interest and superiority, but with an eye to your future felicity: for, one of the surest means of preserving and en|joying the advantages, I have laid before you, is, to instil into your offspring those sentiments, that will make them good and brave; that will teach them the value of the rights of man, and inspire them with sufficient resolution to defend them from encroachment. The general increase of information, opens and expands the mind, enlarges its views, generates independence, and promotes happi|ness; while a bigoted and sordid disposition cramps the growth of
<PB N="13" REF="035229_0012_100164949D813900">
freedom, "which can flourish only in a soil tilled and cultivated with incessant care." Ignorance can never encourage the spirit of Liberty, for she knows it not. She cannot enjoy its pleasures, for she feels them not. She is numb to every patriotic sensation, dead to every generous feeling; and, careless of her real interest, would suffer the dearest rights of humanity to be snatched away without a single effort. But Knowledge fires every heart with ardour, to cherish and preserve the genial principle. And, let it not be thought repugnant to Morality, that these sentiments prevail. Lib|erty and Religion, may both be perverted, and the one change to Anarchy and the other to Superstition, in which situations they can never unite. But pure Republicanism and Virtue, go hand in hand; and should Corruption or Immorality frighten away the one, the other will surely follow. Since, then, they are not to be separated, and both are equally desirable, as tending to the good of mankind, let it be inculcated, as a fundamental maxim, that to seek virtue, and to promote liberty, should be the greatest objects of our pursuit. Nor let it discourage us, that both have been used as masks of hypocrisy, and cloaks to the villany of designing men. The man, who can boldly use their sacred names for wicked pur|poses,
<PB N="14" REF="035229_0013_10016498AA5CAA60">
cannot escape unpunished; nor will you be in danger from his designs, as long as you continue to approve of measures rather than of men. For he, who judges of measures by the unerring rule of right and wrong, will promote the spirit of Freedom, and the good of his country; but he, who lists himself under the standard of party, and determines to support his leader, will introduce, in its stead, the spirit of Faction, and bring down upon us ruin and destruction. We may earnestly wish that these pests may be avert|ed; but every lover of his country will view with sorrow and con|cern, the discordance of opinion that tears her bosom.</P>
<P>MILITARY affairs must also be attended to. And it is an ob|ject of surprize, that men of spirit should consider it as a burden|some, rather than an honourable duty. It is an unlucky omen, that freemen are unwilling to acquire the art, by which only their free|dom can be maintained. You gained your Independence by arms, and by arms alone can you defend it. Should foreign enemies in|vade, or domestic ones seek to oppress, Virtue and Religion can|not save you, nor can Public Spirit alone save you; but a knowl|edge of tactics must be acquired, and that too by yourselves.
<PB N="15" REF="035229_0014_100164C3567A6500">
Hirelings and mercenaries can never protect you. They are ev|er open to corruption, and standing armies may be the tools of op|pressors, but should never be placed as the defenders of freemen. They fight for pay and that only, while every inhabitant contends, with energy, for his property, his friends, his family, and himself. Let every one, therefore, attain the proper skill, and be ready to come forward. When occasion calls, he will then do his duty, and his Country will be safe.</P>
<P>LASTLY, let public spirit always prevail among you, and the prosperity of your land be your greatest boast. You may tread in the steps of your fathers, and preserve the principle they have transmitted down to you, as a rich inheritance. They first kindled in their bosoms the sacred fire of Liberty, which has since blazed over Europe, entered Asia, and spread even to the borders of the Nile. But with them, a happy simplicity of manners prevailed; and, if you imitate them, like them, your efforts will be crowned with success. Thus, while in early youth, you imbibe the princi|ples of freedom and virtue, while you attend to the defence of your Country, nor suffer public spirit, nor purity of manners to de|cay,
<PB N="16" REF="035229_0015_10017D891EF5C800">
you will enjoy your Independence, feel the influence of Lib|erty, and preserve the springs of your excellent Government. But, when you grow careless of these great concerns, and Vice and Luxury are introduced, Corruption will come upon the stage, and Slavery will close the scene.</P>
