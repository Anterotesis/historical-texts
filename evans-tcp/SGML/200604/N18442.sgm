<P>THE territory ceded by the &s;tate of North-Carolina to the United States,<NOTE PLACE="marg">South-we&s;tern Territory.</NOTE> by deed bearing date the 25th day of February 1790, is bounded as fol|lows, to wit: Beginning in the boundary between Virginia and North-Carolina, that is to &s;ay, in the parallel of latitude 36 &frac12; degrees north from the equator, on the extreme height of the Stone Mountain, where the &s;aid boundary or parallel inter&s;ects it, and running thence along the &s;aid extreme height to the place where Wataugo River breaks through it; thence a direct cour&s;e to the top of the Yellow Mountain, where Bright's Road cro&s;&s;es the &s;ame; thence along the ridge of the &s;aid mountain between the waters of Doe River and the waters of Rock Creek, to the place where the road cro&s;&s;es the Iron Mountain; from thence along the extreme height of &s;aid mountain to where Nolichuckey River runs through the &s;ame; thence to the top of the Bald Mountain; thence along the extreme height of the &s;aid mountain to the Painted Rock, on French Broad River; thence along the highe&s;t ridge of the &s;aid mountain, to the place where it is called the Great Iron or Smoaky Mountain; thence along the ex|treme height of the &s;aid mountain to the place where it is called Unaka Moun|tain, between the Indian towns of Cowee and Old Chota; thence along the main ridge of the &s;aid mountain, to the &s;outhern boundary of the &s;aid &s;tate of North-Carolina, that is to &s;ay, to the parallel of latitude 35 degrees north from the equator; thence we&s;twardly along the &s;aid boundary or parallel, to the middle of the river Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi; thence up the middle of the &s;aid river to where it is inter&s;ected by the fir&s;t mentioned parallel of 36 &frac12; degrees; thence along the &s;aid parallel to the beginning: which tract of country is a degree and a half of latitude from north to &s;outh, and about 360 miles, in general, from ea&s;t to we&s;t, as nearly as may be e&s;timated from &s;uch maps as exi&s;t of that country.</P>
<P>The Indians having claims within the &s;aid tract of country,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Indian claims.</NOTE> are the Chero|kees and Chicka&s;aws, who&s;e boundaries are &s;ettled by the treaties of Hopewell, concluded with the Cherokees on the twenty-eighth day of November, 1785, and with the Chicka&s;aws, on the tenth day of January 1786, and by the treaty of Hol&s;ton, concluded with the Cherokees, July &s;econd, 1791. The&s;e trea|ties acknowledge to the &s;aid Indians all the lands we&s;tward and &s;outhward of the following lines, to wit; beginning in the boundary between South and North-Carolina, where the South-Carolina Indian boundary &s;trikes the &s;ame; thence north to a point from which a line is to be extended to the river Clinch, that &s;hall pa&s;s the Hol&s;ton, at the ridge which divides the waters running into Little River, from tho&s;e running into the Tanni&s;&s;ee; thence up the river Clinch to Campbell's Line, and along the &s;ame to the top of the Cumberland mountain; thence in a direct cour&s;e towards the Cumberland river, where the Kentucky road cro&s;&s;es it, as far as the Virginia line, or parallel afore&s;aid, of 30 &frac12; degrees; thence we&s;twardly, or ea&s;twardly, as the ca&s;e &s;hall be, along the &s;aid line or parallel to the point thereof, which is due north-ea&s;t from an|other

point to be taken on the dividing ridge of Cumberland and Duck rivers, 40 miles from Na&s;hville; thence &s;outh-we&s;t to the point la&s;t mentioned, on the &s;aid dividing ridge, and along the &s;aid dividing ridge north-we&s;twardly, to where it is inter&s;ected by the &s;aid Virginia line, or parallel of 36 &frac12; degrees. So that there remained to the United States, the right of pre-emption of the lands we&s;tward and &s;outhward of the &s;aid lines, and the ab&s;olute right to tho&s;e northward thereof, that is to &s;ay; to one parcel to the ea&s;tward, &s;omewhat triangular, comprehending the counties of Sullivan and Wa&s;hington, and parts of tho&s;e of Greene and Hawkins, running about 150 miles from ea&s;t to we&s;t, on the Virginia boundary, as its ba&s;e, and between 80 and 90 miles from north to &s;outh, where broade&s;t; and containing, as may be conjectured, with|out pretending to accuracy, between &s;even and eight thou&s;and &s;quare miles, or about five millions of acres: And to one other parcel to the we&s;tward, &s;omewhat triangular al&s;o, comprehending parts of the counties of Sumner, Da|vid&s;on, and Tanni&s;&s;ee, the ba&s;e whereof extends about 150 miles al&s;o, from ea&s;t to we&s;t, on the &s;ame Virginia line, and its height, from north to &s;outh, about 55 miles, and &s;o may comprehend about four thou&s;and &s;quare miles, or up|wards of two and a half millions of acres of land.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Claims of citi|zens.</NOTE>Within the&s;e triangles, however, are the following claims of citizens, re&s;erved by the deed of ce&s;&s;ion, and con&s;equently forming exceptions to the rights of the United States.</P>
<P N="1">I. Appropriations by the &s;tate of North-Carolina, for their continental and &s;tate officers and &s;oldiers.</P>
<P N="2">II. Grants and titles to grants ve&s;ted in individuals by the laws of the &s;tate.</P>
<P N="3">III. Entries made in Arm&s;trong's office, under an act of that &s;tate, of 1783, for the redemption of &s;pecie and other certificates.</P>
<P>The claims covered by the fir&s;t re&s;ervation are,</P>
<P N="1"><NOTE PLACE="marg">Military boun|ties.</NOTE>1&s;t. The bounties in land given by the &s;aid &s;tate of North-Carolina, to their continental line, in addition to tho&s;e given by Congre&s;s; the&s;e were to be located within a di&s;trict bounded northwardly by the Virginia line, and &s;outh|wardly by a line parallel thereto, and 55 miles di&s;tant: we&s;twardly, by the Tanni&s;&s;ee, and ea&s;twardly by the meridian of the inter&s;ection of the Virginia line, and Cumberland river; grants have accordingly i&s;&s;ued for 1,239,498 acres, and warrants for the further quantity of 1,549,726 acres, making toge|ther 2,789,224 acres.</P>
<P>It is to be noted that the &s;outhwe&s;tern and &s;outhea&s;tern angles of this di&s;trict, con&s;tituting perhaps a fourth or a fifth of the whole, are &s;outh of the lines e&s;tabli&s;hed by the treaties of Hopewell and Hol&s;ton, and con&s;equently in a country wherein the Indian title is acknowledged and guarantied by the Uni|ted States. No information is received of the exact proportion of the locations made within the&s;e angles.</P>
<P N="2">2d. Bounties in land to Evan's battalion, rai&s;ed for &s;tate purpo&s;es. The&s;e were to be taken we&s;t of the Cumberland Mountain. The locations are not yet made.</P>
<P>The &s;econd re&s;ervation covers the following claims:</P>
<P N="1"><NOTE PLACE="marg">Entries and grants.</NOTE>1. Lands for the &s;urveyor-general's fees for laying out the military bounties, to be located in the military di&s;trict. The grants already i&s;&s;ued on this account amount to 30,203 acres.</P>
<P N="2">2. Grants to I&s;aac Shelby, Anthony Bled&s;oe, and Ab&s;alom Tatum, commi&s;|&s;ioners for laying out the military bounties;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Commi&s;&s;ioners.</NOTE> and to guards, chain-carriers, markers, and hunters, who attended them, already i&s;&s;ued to the amount of 65,932 acres, located in the military di&s;trict.</P>
<P N="3">3. Entries in Wa&s;hington county amounting to 746,362 &frac12; acres; for 214,549 &frac34; of which grants have already i&s;&s;ued.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wa&s;hington county.</NOTE> Of the remaining 531,812 &frac14; acres, a con&s;iderable proportion were declared void by the laws of the &s;tate, and were particularly excluded from the cover of the re&s;ervation in the deed
<PB N="5" REF="023913_0004_0FC289BB06815438">
of ce&s;&s;ion, by this clau&s;e in it, to wit, "Provided that nothing herein contained &s;hall extend, or be con&s;trued to extend, to the making good any <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> or en|tries, or any grant or grants, heretofore declared void, by any act or <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> of the General A&s;&s;embly of this &s;tate." Still it is to be con&s;idered, that many of the&s;e per&s;ons have &s;ettled and improved the lands, are willing, as is &s;aid, to comply with &s;uch conditions as &s;hall be required of other purcha&s;ers, form a &s;trong barrier on the new frontier, acquired by the treaty of Hol&s;ton, and are there|fore objects meriting the con&s;ideration of the Legi&s;lature.</P>
<P N="4">4. Entries in Sullivan county, amounting to 240,624 acres;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sullivan county.</NOTE> for 173,332 acres of which, grants have already i&s;&s;ued; of the remaining entries, many are certified void, and others under&s;tood to be lap&s;ed or otherwi&s;e voidable under the laws of the &s;tate.</P>
<P N="5">5. Certain pre-emption rights granted to the fir&s;t &s;ettlers of David&s;on county,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pre-emptions.</NOTE> on Cumberland river, amounting to 309,760 acres.</P>
<P N="6">6. A grant of 200,000 acres to Richard Hender&s;on and others on Powel's and Clinch's rivers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hender&s;on.</NOTE> extending up Powel's river in a breadth of not le&s;s than 4 miles, and down Clinch's from their junction in a breadth not le&s;s than 12 miles. A great part of this is within the Indian territory.</P>
<P>Among the grants of the &s;tate now under recapitulation, as forming excep|tions out of the ab&s;olute rights of the United States, are not to be reckoned here two grants of 2,000 acres each to Alexander Martin and David Wil&s;on,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Martin &amp; Wil|&s;on.</NOTE> adjacent to the lands allotted to the officers and &s;oldiers; nor a grant of 25,000 acres on Duck river to the late Major General Greene;<NOTE PLACE="marg">General Greene.</NOTE> becau&s;e they are whol|ly within the Indian territory, as acknowledged by the treaties of Hopewell and Hol&s;ton.</P>
<P>The extent of the third re&s;ervation in favor of entries made in Arm&s;trong's office is not yet entirely known, nor can be till the 20th of December, 1702,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Arm&s;trong's of|fice.</NOTE> the la&s;t day given for perfecting them: the &s;um of certificates, however, which had been paid for the&s;e warrants into the trea&s;ury of the &s;tate, before the 20th day of May 1790, reaches in all probability near to their whole amount; this was &pound;.373,649: 6: 5, currency of that &s;tate, and at the price of &pound;.10 the hun|dred acres, e&s;tabli&s;hed by law, &s;hews that warrants had i&s;&s;ued for 3,736,493 acres; for 1,762,660 of the&s;e, grants have pa&s;&s;ed, which appear to have been located partly in the counties of Greene and Hawkins, and partly in the coun|try, from thence to the Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi, as divided into Ea&s;tern, Middle, and We&s;t|ern di&s;tricts. Almo&s;t the whole of the&s;e locations are within the Indian terri|tory. Be&s;ides the warrants paid for as before mentioned, it is known that there are &s;ome others out-&s;tanding and not paid for: but perhaps the&s;e need not be taken into account, as payment of them has been di&s;puted on the ground, that the lands being within the Indian territory, cannot now be delivered to the holders of the warrants.</P>
<P>On a review of all the re&s;ervations, after making &s;uch conjectural allowance as our information authorizes, for the proportion of them, which may be with|in the Indian boundaries, it appears probable that they cover all the ceded lands &s;u&s;ceptible of culture, and cleared of the Indian title, that is to &s;ay, all the habitable parts of the two triangles beforementioned, excepting only the lands &s;outh of French Broad, and Big Pigeon Rivers. The&s;e were part of the tract appropriated by the laws of the &s;tate, to the u&s;e of the Indians, who&s;e ti|tle being purcha&s;ed at the late treaty of Hol&s;ton, they are now free to be di&s;po|&s;ed of by the United States, and are probably the only lands open to their di&s;|po&s;al, within this &s;outh-we&s;tern territory, which can excite the attention of pur|cha&s;ers. They are &s;uppo&s;ed to amount to about 300,000 acres, and we are told that 300 families have already &s;et down upon them without right or li|cen&s;e.</P>
<P>The territory of the United States north-we&s;t of the Ohio,<NOTE PLACE="marg">North-we&s;tern territory.</NOTE> is bounded on the &s;outh by that river, on the ea&s;t by Penn&s;ylvania, on the north and we&s;t,
<PB N="6" REF="023913_0005_0FC289BEE72D5F88">
by the lines which divide the United States from the dominions of Great-Bri|tain and Spain.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Claims of In|dians.</NOTE>The part of this territory occupied by Indians, is north and we&s;t of the following lines, e&s;tabli&s;hed with the Wiandots, Delawares, Chippawas, and Ottawas, by the treaty of Fort M'Into&s;h, and, with the Shawane&s;e, by that of the Great Miami, to wit: beginning at the mouth of the Cayahoga, and running up the river to the portage, between that and the Tu&s;caroras branch of the Mu&s;kingum, then down the &s;aid branch to the Forks, at the cro&s;&s;ing place above Fort Lawrence, then we&s;twardly, towards the portage of the Big Miami, to the main branch of that river, then down the Miami to the fork of that river next below the old Fort, which was taken by the French in 1752; thence due we&s;t to the river De la Pan&s;e, and down that river to the Waba&s;h. So far the lines are preci&s;ely defined, and the whole country &s;outhward of the&s;e lines, and ea&s;tward of the Waba&s;h cleared of the claims of tho&s;e Indians, as it is al&s;o of tho&s;e of the Poutiwatimas, and Sacs, by the treaty of Mu&s;kingum. How far on the other &s;ide of the Waba&s;h, the &s;outh|ern boundary of the Indians has been defined, we know not. It is only un|der&s;tood in general, that their title to the lower country, between that river and the Illinois, has been formally extingui&s;hed by the French, while in their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. As to that country then, and what lies &s;till beyond the Illinois, it would &s;eem expedient that nothing be done, till a fair a&s;certainment of boundary can take place, by mutual con&s;ent, between us and the Indians in|tere&s;ted.</P>
<P>The country within the Waba&s;h, the Indian line before de&s;cribed, the Penn|&s;ylvania line, and the Ohio, contains, on a loo&s;e e&s;timate, about 55,000 &s;quare miles, or 35 millions of acres.</P>
<P>During the Briti&s;h government, great numbers or per&s;ons had formed them&s;elves into companies under different names,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ancient compa|nies.</NOTE> &s;uch as the Ohio, the Wa|bache, the Illinois, the Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi, or Vandalia companies, and had covered, with their applications, a great part of this territory. Some of them had ob|tained orders on certain conditions, which, having never been fulfilled, their titles were never completed by grants. Others were only in a &s;tate of nego|ciation, when the Briti&s;h authority was di&s;continued. Some of the&s;e claims being already under a &s;pecial reference by order of Congre&s;s, and all of them probably falling under the operation of the &s;ame principles, they will not be noticed in the pre&s;ent report.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Claims of Citi|zens.</NOTE>The claims of citizens to be here &s;tated will be,</P>

<P N="2"><NOTE PLACE="marg">French at Ka&s;|ka&s;kias, &amp;c.</NOTE>2. A re&s;ervation in the deed of Virginia of the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions and titles of the French and Canadian inhabitants and other &s;ettlers of the Ka&s;ka&s;kias, St. Vincents, and the neighboring villages, who had profe&s;&s;ed them&s;elves citi|zens of Virginia, which rights have been &s;ettled by an act of the la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion of Congre&s;s, intituled, "An act for granting lands to the inhabitants and &s;et|tlers at Vincennes and the Illinois country in the territory north-we&s;t of the Ohio, and for confirming them in their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions." The&s;e lands are in the neighborhood of the &s;everal villages.</P>

By a &s;tatement of the 16th of September, 1788, it appears that 724,045 <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">/3 acres had been &s;ur|veyed for them on the &s;outh-ea&s;tern &s;ide of the Ohio; that 1,395,385 <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">/3 acres had been &s;urveyed on the north-we&s;tern &s;ide; that warrants for 649,649 acres more, to be laid off on the &s;ame &s;ide of the river, were in the hands of the &s;urveyor, and it was &s;uppo&s;ed there might &s;till be &s;ome few warrants not yet pre&s;ented; &s;o that this re&s;ervation may be &s;tated at 2,045,034 &frac13; acres, or perhaps &s;ome &s;mall matter more.</P>

cour&s;e of the &s;aid Great Miami; and on the north by an ea&s;t&punc; and we&s;t line, &s;o run as to include a million of acres in the whole area, whereof five lots, num|bered as before mentioned, are re&s;erved out of every town&s;hip by the United States.</P>
<P>It is &s;ugge&s;ted that this purcha&s;er, under colour of a fir&s;t and larger propo|&s;ition to the board of trea&s;ury, which was never clo&s;ed, (but pending that pro|&s;ition) &s;old &s;undry parcels of land, between his ea&s;tern boundary before men|tioned, and the Little Miami; and that the purcha&s;ers have &s;ettled thereon. If the&s;e &s;ugge&s;tions prove true, the &s;ettlers will, perhaps, be thought to merit the favor of the legi&s;lature, as purcha&s;ers for valuable con&s;ideration, and with|out notice of the defect of title.</P>
<P>The contracts for lands, which were at one time under con&s;ideration with Me&s;&s;rs. Flint and Parker,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Flint &amp; Parker. Morgan.</NOTE> and with Colonel Morgan, were never &s;o far pro&s;ecu|ted as to bring either party under any obligation. All proceedings thereon were di&s;continued at a very early &s;tage, and it is &s;uppo&s;ed that no further views exi&s;t with any party. The&s;e, therefore, are not to be enumerated among exi&s;t|ing claims.</P>

Three town&s;hips were re&s;erved by the ordinance of May 20, 1785, adja|cent to Lake Erie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Canadian refu|gees.</NOTE> for refugees from Canada and Nova-Scotia, and for other purpo&s;es, according to re&s;olutions of Congre&s;s, made or to be made on that &s;ubject.

<P N="7"><NOTE PLACE="marg">Chri&s;tian In|dians.</NOTE>7. The &s;ame ordinance of May 20, 1785, appropriated the three towns of Gnadenhutten, Schoenbrun, and Salem, on the Mu&s;kingum, for the chri&s;tian Indians formerly &s;ettled there, or the remains of that &s;ociety, with the grounds round about them, and the quantity of the &s;aid circumjacent grounds, for each of the &s;aid towns, was determined by the re&s;olution of Congre&s;s of September 3d, 1788, to be &s;o much as, with the plat of its re&s;pective town, &s;hould make up 4000 acres; &s;o that the three towns and their circumjacent lands were to a|mount to 12,000 acres. This re&s;ervation was accordingly made out of the larger purcha&s;e of Cutler and Sargent, which comprehended them. The Indians, however, for whom the re&s;ervation was made, have cho&s;en to emigrate beyond the limits of the United States, &s;o that the lands re&s;erved for them, &s;till remain to the United States.</P>
