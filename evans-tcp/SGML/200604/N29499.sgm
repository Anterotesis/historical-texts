<HEAD>BY HIS EXCELLENCY THE GOVERNOUR.</HEAD>
<P>WHEREAS it hath been of ab&s;olute Nece&s;&s;ity, that a certain Number of men &s;hould be Impre&s;&s;ed, for the Service of Their Maje&s;ties, in Defence of this their Province, both at Sea and Land, again&s;t the common Enemy. And that &s;ome per&s;ons imployed therein, have pa&s;&s;ed the Bounds of their Duty, and my Order, by putting the &s;ame in Execution in a violent and di&s;|orderly manner, to the great Grievance of Their Maje&s;ties good Subjects.</P>
<P><HI>For preventing &s;uch Di&s;orders for the future, and rendring to all injured Per&s;ons due Satisfaction, I do hereby Publi&s;h and Declare.</HI></P>
<P>THat as &s;uch violent and undue methods have been u&s;ed without my Knowledge, and to my great Di&s;turbance, there &s;hall be effectual care taken, that &s;uch as have received Damage thereby, &s;hall Be Relieved, and all tho&s;e that have been the occa&s;ion thereof &s;hall be &s;everely puni&s;hed.</P>
<P>And all people what&s;oever are to take notice, that no per&s;on &s;hall hereafter be Pre&s;t into their Maje&s;ties Service, but by a par|ticular Warrant to the Military Officers, or Con&s;tables, for that Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>And if any &s;hall pre&s;ume to Act contrary to their Duty upon any &s;uch occa&s;ion, all Ju&s;tices of the Peace and all Officers Mi|litary and Civil, are Required in the Name of their Maje&s;ties to cau&s;e them to be Seized, and Secured, in order to their being puni&s;hed, according to the utmo&s;t &s;everity of the Law.</P>
<P>And whereas divers Souldiers Entered in their Maje&s;ties Service and Pay, have pre&s;umed to leave their Po&s;ts, and &s;ome have out &s;taid their Pa&s;s, without leave from their Commanders, others Impre&s;t for their Maje&s;ties Service, have ab&s;ented and not ap|peared according to Order.</P>
<P>I do therefore Order and &s;trictly Command, all &s;uch Souldiers, forthwith to Repair unto their Re&s;pective Po&s;ts, and Duty, as they will an&s;wer their Neglect at their Peril, and all Officers Military and Civil, that &s;hall know, or be informed of any &s;uch De&s;erters or Runaway Soldiers, are to cau&s;e them to be taken up, and conveyed before the next Ju&s;tice of the Peace, in order to their being Returned, and &s;ent unto their Re&s;pective Officers, and every Ju&s;tice of the Peace, is hereby Impowred and Required to deal effectually, in this matter; and no Soldier may pre&s;ume to leave his Po&s;t, or ab&s;ent him&s;elf from his Duty, on pain of being proceeded again&s;t with utmo&s;t &s;everity of Law.</P>
<P>And whereas a vigorous Endeavour to &s;uppre&s;s the Growth of Wickedne&s;s and Prophanene&s;s in this Territory, is not onely the way to obtain the gracious Pre&s;ence of Almighty God, without which we can expect no good Succe&s;s of our Affairs, but al|&s;o a thing for which Their Maje&s;ties have given their particular In&s;tructions.</P>
<P>IT is hereby Required, That all the whol&s;ome Laws here in Force again&s;t Vices of all kinds, and particularly the Laws again&s;t Bla&s;phemy, Swearing, Cur&s;ing, Lying, unlawful Gaming, Sabbath-breaking, Idlene&s;s, Drunkenne&s;s, Uncleanne&s;s, and all Nur&s;eries and Inticements of &s;uch Impietys, be in their Maje&s;ties Name im|mediately, and impartially put in Execution. And all Ju&s;tices, of the Peace, Con&s;ta|bles, Tithing men, or what-ever other Officers, as well Civil as Military, as are therein concerned, are hereby directed, enjoyned, and in Their Maje&s;ties Name Required, in this matter to di&s;charge the Duty of their places, with all fidelity, and all &s;orts of per&s;ons to conform them&s;elves accordingly: And it is hereby &s;ignified, that upon Complaint made, and proved again&s;t any Officers; of having neglected their Duty, the utmo&s;t mark of Di&s;plea&s;ure &s;hall be &s;et upon them, while tho&s;e that are found faithful, &s;hall be encouraged with all fit Acknowledgments. Given at Bo&s;ton, and Dated the 27th day of July, 1692. In the Fourth Year of Their Maje&s;ties Reign.</P>
