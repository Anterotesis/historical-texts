<Q><BIBL>HEBREWS xiii.4.</BIBL>
<P>MARRIAGE IS HONOURABLE IN ALL, AND THE BED UNDEFILED: BUT WHOREMONGERS AND ADULTERERS GOD WILL JUDGE.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE natural propen&s;ity of the human &s;pe|cies to multiply and repleni&s;h the earth, has al|ways been too great to go unregulated by &s;ome wi&s;e and whol&s;ome in&s;titution from heaven. Therefore, for the great end of rendering mankind more happy, than they otherwi&s;e could have been, the God of love has favoured us with the in&s;titution of Marriage.</P>
<P>In di&s;cour&s;ing upon the words of the text thus introduced, we will</P>
<P N="1">I. Illu&s;trate the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">a, that marriage is hon|ourable in all.</P>
<P N="2">II. Take notice, that the propagation of our &s;pecies without marriage, mu&s;t be whoredom and
<PB N="14" REF="028341_0009_0FD88C1C6EC2A078">
adultery, which will be condemned by a righteous God, the Judge of all the earth&mdash;and then,</P>
<P N="3">III. Draw a few inferences from the whole.</P>
<P N="1">1. Notwith&s;tanding the example &s;et us by the Clergy of the Church of Rome&punc; and many others of the dei&s;tical tribe among civilians&mdash;notwith|&s;tanding the &s;entiments of Lord Bolingbroke, that poligamy is a dictate of nature&mdash;notwith&s;tanding the &s;entiments and examples of the&s;e and many others, who have fooli&s;hly ridiculed revealed in&s;titutions&mdash;we &s;ay, that our God has told us, that <HI>Marriage is honourable in all</HI>; this will ap|pear&punc; if we con&s;ider that marriage is an in&s;titution of heaven, and among the children of men, is a civil contract, by which, for life, one man and one woman are joined together as hu&s;band and wife. The Saviour of the world has told us&mdash; That he who made us <HI>at the beginning,</HI> made us <HI>male and female,</HI> and &s;ays, <HI>for this cau&s;e, a man &s;hall leave father and mother, and &s;hall cle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ve to his wife, and they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">wain &s;hall be one fle&s;h.</HI> Hence one great end in the <HI>formation of man,</HI> was that they might multiply and repleni&s;h the earth.</P>
<P>The union of one man and one woman as hu&s;|band and wife, therefore, mu&s;t be honourable in the &s;ight of heaven, con&s;equently, mu&s;t be hon|ourable in the &s;ight of all tho&s;e who have any re&s;pect to tho&s;e in&s;titutions which God has made for the good of mankind.</P>
<P N="2">2. Marriage mu&s;t be honourable, becau&s;e this is the only way of propagating our &s;pecies, which is truly virtuous. Nothing which is virtuous can be di&s;honourable in the &s;ight of God, or even in the &s;ight of men who&s;e judgments are regulated by a love of propriety and truth.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="15" REF="028341_0010_0FD8B0FB9D653520">3. Marriage mu&s;t be honourable, becau&s;e it is profitable. Man and woman are mutually profit|ed by a judicious connection of this kind; in this way their wants may be &s;upplied by each other with more ea&s;e than in any other: this is a truth applicable to mankind in general.</P>
<P N="4">4. Marriage mu&s;t be honourable, becau&s;e it renders virtuous men and women more happy than they can be without it. In the married &s;tate, there are ten thou&s;and joys and innocent plea&s;ures, which men and women in a &s;ingle &s;tate can never experience and be virtuous. The happy, virtuous and m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ied pair, viewing them|&s;elves as having one common intere&s;t, and feel|ing them&s;el<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> animated by one &s;oul, will readily partic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> each others labours and &s;orrows, and w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> communicate to each plea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> joys; and while they trea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the rougher <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of life, hand in hand, they will beguile the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">e&s;ome walk with mutual and enchanting &s;mile<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&mdash;with plea&s;ures, which have never yet found names to expre&s;s them.</P>
<P N="2">II. We were to take notice, that the propaga|tion of our &s;pecies, without marriage, mu&s;t be whoredom and adultery, which will be condemn|ed by a righteous God, the judge of all the earth.</P>
<P N="1">1. Here let it be remembered, that God will cen&s;ure and condemn every thing which in its nature, is contrary to his holy law, di&s;honourable to him&s;elf, and injurious to his creatures&punc; but whoredom and adultery are unlawful, di&s;hon|ourable to God, and injurious to mankind, there|fore, the perpetrators of the&s;e &s;hameful crimes
<PB N="16" REF="028341_0011_0FD8B0FD43C25760">
mu&s;t expect to meet their angry Judge, who will not fail to treat them as the rude violators of his holy laws, and abu&s;ers of his creatures.</P>
<P>That this vicious cour&s;e of conduct is a viola|tion of the law of God, mu&s;t be evident to every one who reads his Bible; that it is injurious to mankind, will appear from the following con&s;id|erations:</P>
<P N="1">1. It never fails of introducing confu&s;ion and di&s;tre&s;s into families and &s;ocieties where it take<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> place. How many of the fair and unguarded &s;ex, by means of this di&s;graceful conduct, have been obliged to pine and die, in circum&s;tances the mo&s;t wretched and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">orlor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> How many chil|dren have been expo&s;ed to want, and even death in con&s;equence thereof, who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> might have been well <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ided <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s of infamy do all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ho &s;u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> them to the grave!</P>
<P N="2">2. Though it be a fact, that &s;everal men of fortune and influence have taken care to provide for, and educate their illegitimate and &s;purious offspring, yet it is more than probable, that ten to one of tho&s;e unfortunate mortals have &s;uffer|ed beyond all expre&s;&s;ion by means of the un|happy circum&s;tances which attended their being brought into exi&s;tence. The hi&s;tory of a Savage, one of the Briti&s;h Poets, would be enough to convince any one of this. And if the great and the opulent neglect their natural children, and &s;uffer them to endure innumerable evils, for want of their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, what may we expect to find among the ignorant and indigent parts of &s;ociety,
<PB N="17" REF="028341_0012_0FD8B0FE9B68C110">
who, without controul, give them&s;elves up to the unlawful gratification of their pa&s;&s;ions?</P>
<P>The many in&s;tances of parents being executed for the murder of their illegitimate children, are more than ten thou&s;and arguments again&s;t this ab&s;urd and vicious mode of propagating our &s;pe|cies in the world.</P>
<P>They who indulge them&s;elves in whoredom or adultery, mutually abu&s;e and defile one another: they di&s;grace their families, injure &s;ociety, and di&s;honour their Maker; and therefore, without repentance, cannot e&s;cape the wrath of God.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="improvement">
<HEAD>IMPROVEMENT.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. Has God, for the happine&s;s of mankind, given as the in&s;titution of marriage, and is <HI>mar|riage</HI> and the <HI>bed undefiled</HI> honourable in all? Then we ought to feel the obligations we are un|der, to ob&s;erve this regulation of our pa&s;&s;ions in life. Have we not rea&s;on to fear, there are ma|ny who live under the light of the Go&s;pel, with|out any reali&s;ing &s;en&s;e of the goodne&s;s of God, in this happy in&s;titution&mdash;that feel them&s;elves un|der no obligation to ob&s;erve the will of heaven re&s;pecting this matter? This is, and ought to be for a lamentation among chri&s;tian people.</P>
<P N="2">2. From what has been &s;aid, we may learn, what an odious figure tho&s;e make in the &s;ight of God, and in the &s;ight of all the virtuous part of mankind, who indulge them&s;elves in propagating their &s;pecies by acts of whoredom and adultery: &s;uch characters will not bear an examination; the plea&s;ures which they take in the&s;e vicious ways are attended with &s;tings of con&s;cience, with di&s;grace and infamy to them&s;elves and their
<PB N="18" REF="028341_0013_0FD8B103C02A8AA0">
wretched po&s;terity in this life, and with puni&s;h|ment in the life which is to come, if unrepented of.</P>
<P N="3">3. How thankful ought we to be for the in&s;ti|tution of marriage, which is &s;o wonderfully cal|culated to promote the happine&s;s of mankind. By entering into the married &s;tate, the natural propen&s;ities of male and female towards each other, may be indulged in perfect con&s;i&s;tency, with the mo&s;t elevated and pious feelings of an holy and humble heart: for there is nothing more criminal in that natural inclination which the &s;ex have for the enjoyment of each other, than there is in hunger or thir&s;t, with which the God of na|ture has univer&s;ally endowed the human &s;pecies. As we are rational creatures, we are then crimi|nal when we indulge the&s;e propen&s;ities, or natur|al appetites in an unlawful way and manner, which con&s;titutes whoredom, adultery, gluttony and drunkenne&s;s.</P>
<P N="4">4. Is marriage of &s;o much importance as to promote the honour and happine&s;s of mankind? then we may learn the propriety of laying down rules or directions for the choice of &s;uitable com|panions in life, that we may virtuou&s;ly propagate our &s;pecies in the world.</P>
<P>Therefore, we &s;hall now lay down &s;everal gen|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters"> rules or prudential Maxims, worthy to be trea&s;ured up in the memories of tho&s;e young people, who would obtain &s;uitable companions in life; after which we &s;hall give &s;everal in&s;tan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">es of Court&s;hips, not unworthy of the imitation of the American Youth.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="028341_0014_0FD8B104AB947E80">MAXIM 1.&mdash;Never undertake to woo a com|panion previous to your arriving to an age fit for marriage: for not ob&s;erving this precaution, ma|ny a &s;prightly youth has been &s;o entangled with premature connections, as have been very griev|ous through life.</P>
<P>MAXIM 2.&mdash;No per&s;on ought to engage in the delightful bu&s;ine&s;s of courting, while his cir|cum&s;tances in life afford no rational pro&s;pect of &s;upporting a &s;mall family, and of his pretty &s;oon entering into a &s;tate of wedlock: for not ob&s;erv|ing the&s;e precautions, many evils have attended the married &s;tate, and injured the parties all their days.</P>
<P>MAXIM 3.&mdash;Youth who are under age, ought to form no connection for the purpo&s;e of keeping company, without the approbation of their par|ents or guardians.</P>
<P>The not ob&s;erving this maxim, has plunged many a promi&s;ing youth into great difficulties. However, in all ca&s;es in which this is impractica|ble, by means of the want of parents and guar|dians, youth are ju&s;tified in proceeding without it.</P>
<P>MAXIM 4.&mdash;Let none propo&s;e marriage, long before any real pro&s;pect of entering into that neare&s;t and deare&s;t of all connections. The do|ing of this, has proved a &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">are to the undoing of many a lovely youth: the pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;e of marriage has untied the bands of virtue, and thrown many innocent creatures off their guard, to the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> entire ruin.</P>
<P>MAXIM 5 &mdash;It is not de&s;irable for per&s;ons o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> an un&s;uitable age to m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">n with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n other&punc;
<PB N="20" REF="028341_0015_0FD8B107309ED6A0">
However, a few years more in the age of the male than the age of the female, has been found by experience not inconvenient, owing probably, to women's failing in their natural &s;trength and vigour &s;ooner than men. But when the age of the parties are &s;o di&s;proportionate, as to find the one party in the bloom and vigour of life, and the other undergoing all the infirmities of old age, much of the happine&s;s of the married &s;tate is interrupted, if not wholly prevented.</P>
<P>MAXIM 6.&mdash;The parties who would wi&s;h to match with each other, ought to be as nearly of a level, as to reputation, and family, as po&s;&s;ible; otherwi&s;e, &s;cenes of contention may ari&s;e, which in time may ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r the delicious &s;weets of matri|mony, and render the conjugal life burden&s;ome.</P>
<P>MAXIM 7.&mdash;It is unde&s;irable, if not unlawful, for per&s;ons of piety, to match with open and a|vowed infidels. It is likewi&s;e frequently incon|venient for per&s;ons of one denomination, to match with per&s;ons of another, e&s;pecially tho&s;e, who are of &s;uch denominations as admit of no communion with each other. The evil effects of &s;uch heterogeneous connections, are too many here to be enumerated.</P>
<P>MAXIM 8.&mdash;It is prepo&s;terous for any to marry only for the &s;ake of money; for riches may take unto them&s;elves wings and fly away: and when this comes to pa&s;s, it will be ten to one if all the &s;weets of matrimony do not follow, and innumerable evils ri&s;e in their room. In&s;tances of this kind have not been unfrequent in every part of the world.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="028341_0016_0FD8B1086EC9DFF0">MAXIM 9.&mdash;Other things being equal, &s;enti|ment intermingled with unfeigned affection, ought to be the great ba&s;is on which a connection &s;o honourable and plea&s;ant as that of matrimony &s;hould be founded. They who &s;uffer their fancy to take the lead of their judgment in the choice of companions, will be in great danger of being deceived, and finally rendered unhappy in the conjugal &s;tate.</P>
<P>MAXIM 10.&mdash;In the choice of companions, the parties &s;hould as thorougly as po&s;&s;ible, inve&s;ti|gate each others natural tempers. Some are of a temper &s;o rough and boi&s;terous, or &s;o &s;ullen and unforgiving, that a per&s;on of a tender heart, calm di&s;po&s;ition, and delicate con&s;titution, could no more be happy with them in the bands of matri|mony, than a lamb in the company of a tyger, or a dove in the pre&s;ence of a hawk. Many a poor wretch having never &s;een the intended com|panion, but in hours of the greate&s;t plea&s;antry, has been decoyed into a match as un&s;uitable as can well be expre&s;&s;ed. It is acknowledged, that in many in&s;tances, the natural tempers of young people lie much out of &s;ight, and con&s;equently cannot be known without much attention: this ought not to di&s;courage, but engage all to obtain this knowledge.</P>

<P>WE &s;hall now give you an hi&s;tory of a court&s;hip not unworthy of your imitation. It is that which took place between Strephon and Eliza, American you<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h.</P>
<P>Strephon was a young gentleman of about twenty-five years of age; a per&s;on of gente<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l de|portment; his &s;hapes, lim<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> and features were well proportioned; comely, though not very hand&s;ome; of good parentage, but of a moderate intere&s;t; of a mo&s;t amiable moral character, and devoutly religious.</P>
<P>Eliza was a young lady of about eighteen years of age, who&s;e per&s;on was in almo&s;t every re&s;pect captivating: &s;he was rather above the middle &s;ize for height, &s;trait and well proportioned through|out, her features regular and charming, her &s;kin admirably fair, her eyes black and expre&s;&s;ive, her hair dark and flowing; &s;he was of a mode&s;t, amiable and religious character, and of a family truly excellent.</P>
<P>Strephon and Eliza were of the &s;ame re|ligion, and had natural tempers and turns of mind, in many re&s;pects, much alike. Strephon
<PB N="23" REF="028341_0018_0FD8B10F1F7F2BE0">
had been much more acquainted with the world than Eliza, for he had &s;een much company, for a man of his age. Eliza, by means of her tender parents, had been led in a cour&s;e of life more re|tired, till the age of &s;eventeen; of con&s;equence, her ideas and &s;entiments re&s;pecting matrimony, were &s;uch as &s;he had gained from books, and from the wi&s;e and cha&s;te conver&s;ation of her dear parents, and a few &s;elect friends of great mode&s;ty and worth.</P>
<P>Kind providence &s;o ordered events, that Stre|phon and Eliza became acquainted with each other, and indeed long before they had kept one anothers company; they were both in love, and both ignorant of their being beloved by each other. Their mutual feelings and conduct may be learned from the following corre&s;pondence, together with tho&s;e hi&s;toric &s;ketches which are in|ter&s;per&s;ed through the whole &s;cene of their Court&s;hip, which was completed in le&s;s than two years.</P>

<P>I HAVE given Mi&s;s B&mdash; I.&mdash; liberty to call on you for tho&s;e volumes of Mr. Addi&s;ons works which I left with you &s;ome time &s;ince. If you have read them as much as you have an incli|nation, you can &s;pare them, if not, keep them &s;till.

<HEAD>LETTER IV. STREPHON TO ELIZA.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Eliza,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IF I mi&s;take not, I have heard you ob&s;erve, that you were peculiarly fond of hi&s;tory. It has ju&s;t come into my head to give you a &s;ketch of my life from Friday la&s;t to the pre&s;ent time. I am &s;or|ry my &s;ubject is of &s;o melancholy a nature, how|ever, I will comfort my&s;elf that perhaps the next time I write to you, I may have a &s;ubject more lively and entertaining. We &s;hould not know how to prize the innumerable favours of this life, were we to experience no evils while in the world.</P>
<P>Between ten and eleven o'clock on Friday la&s;t, in a very weak and languid &s;ituation of body (for you mu&s;t know I have been &s;ick &s;ince you went from home) I took my leave of your honoured parents and dear family with an heart penetrated with un|di&s;&s;embled gratitude, for the many favours they be&s;towed on me while at H&mdash;r. It would have been a con&s;ideration more plea&s;ing than I am able to expre&s;s, to have received a parting &s;mile and charming look from my deare&s;t friend, my lovely Eliza, but the&s;e were impracticable: The kinde&s;t hearts and deare&s;t friends are &s;ometimes ne|ce&s;&s;itated to bleed alone. You were from home and knew nothing of my &s;ickne&s;s or emotions of heart.</P>
<P>Upon the road from your fathers to the Rev. Mr. H&mdash;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> my thoughts were principally em|ployed on the various affections and mercies, pains and plea&s;ures, enjoyments and di&s;appoint|ments of which I had been the &s;ubject during my
<PB N="28" REF="028341_0023_0FD8B11DD9F1E050">
Hanoverian vi&s;it. I could not help thinking that this vi&s;it was a picture of human life in miniature, nor forbear adoring the great Jehovah for the many u&s;eful le&s;&s;ons I had been taught during it. O Eliza, mankind may &s;ay what they plea&s;e, but I am per&s;uaded, that it is as impo&s;&s;ible for us to be truly happy without real virtue, as it is for us to be rich without the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of any thing whatever. When I arrived at my old friend's, Mr. H&mdash;s, I found his &s;on, the &s;cholar, from Philadelphia, and daughter from New-York, were both at home; the whole family were apparently plea&s;ed to &s;ee me &s;o far recovered from that dreadful &s;tate of illne&s;s under which I had been labouring. When people appear happy in our company, we are naturally led to think they are our real friends: but this is not unfrequently <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> delu&s;ion. In &s;uch ca&s;es we &s;ometimes find our|&s;elves greatly deceived by the enchanting airs of love and friend&s;hip. O Eliza! Hypocri&s;y is one of the greate&s;t blots that ever &s;tained the dignity of man: may kind heaven ever keep you and I at the greate&s;t remove from it.</P>
<P>I think Mrs. T&mdash; ju&s;t as &s;he was before &s;he was married, only older&mdash;that Mi&s;s H&mdash; pants for the joys of matrimony&mdash;and that Mi&s;s P&mdash; will enter into the connubial &s;tate within ten days. At two in the afternoon I took my leave of the old gentleman and his lady, together with my merry friends, the young gentlemen and ladies, and proceeded on my way homeward a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> far as your brother B&mdash;l's, where I &s;pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t my time with more plea&s;ure than is common on &s;u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> vi&s;its.

woman of uncommon accompli&s;hments; &s;he is very agreeable in her conver&s;ation, and well worthy of the man who has cho&s;en her for his com|panion in life: I wi&s;h all her Papa's daughters may make women as excellent as &s;he is.</P>
<P>My next &s;tage was at Mr. P&mdash;'s, where I al|ways call with peculiar plea&s;ure. After &s;ome a|greeable chat, I enquired for your intimate friend Mi&s;s &mdash;, who was from home. I told my friends I had been lately informed by one who pre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ends to know almo&s;t every thing, that I was married to her, which rai&s;ed an agreeable &s;mile on every countenance in the room. Mi&s;s P&mdash;, however, not being at home, I was nece&s;&s;arily deprived of a &s;ight of my bo&s;om companion.</P>
<P>My next &s;tage was at the Rev. Mr. L&mdash;s, where I was received ju&s;t at du&s;k, with all that friend&s;hip which gladdens the heart of a weary traveller. Having &s;upped, I walked out &s;everal rods from the hou&s;e, where, in a &s;udden and &s;ur|pri&s;ing manner, I was &s;eized with a fit of languor &s;o great, that for &s;ome time&punc; I de&s;paired of ever reaching the hou&s;e again; however, by &s;ome means or other, I know not by what, I got into the hou&s;e, where my good friends u&s;ed every mean in their power to keep life in me, for &s;ever|al hours on the &s;tretch. Mi&s;s B. your great inti|mate and admirer, with her brother, watched with me through the night; her kindne&s;s brought my friend Eliza into full view, who&s;e tenderne&s;s to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> when formerly &s;ick at her father's, can never be era&s;ed from my mind, while &s;en&s;ibility and r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">ction are unde&s;troyed.

home, where I remained in this unhappy &s;itua|tion, till two in the afternoon of the next day, when I gained in &s;ome good degree, my natural flow of &s;pirits, and experienced that plea&s;ure and freedom of thought in contemplating the good|ne&s;s and mercy of God our Saviour, which no words can fully expre&s;s. O Eliza, it is in him we live, move, and have our being; and nothing ought to divert our attention from the great duty of a&s;cribing to him glory and honour for ever and ever.</P>
<P>Thus I have given you an imperfect &s;ketch of the mo&s;t remarkable events which have happened to me &s;ince I left your Papa's: and though they may appear trifling to an indifferent per&s;on, they may admini&s;ter &s;ome &s;atisfaction to a friend.

The re|covery of your health, and that flow of natural &s;pirits &s;o common to you, together with that calmne&s;s and tranquility of mind in devotional exerci&s;es, are circum&s;tances of too much value, to pa&s;s unnoticed by a friend.

<P>On a &s;ummer's eve, being &s;eated under a green ar|bour, the thought for the fir&s;t time &s;prang into Stre|phon's mind, Why will not Eliza, the young, the charming Eliza, make thee happy, O Strephon, in the &s;weet bondage of honourable wedlock?

<P>That I &s;hould write on a &s;ubject of this kind, is what I could not have believed, though an an|gel &s;hould have declared it unto me.

A pri|vate interview, perhaps, may &s;ettle this matter to our mutual &s;atisfaction.

The&s;e facts lead me to ob|&s;erve, that in my view, I am a kind of miracle, for I cannot under&s;tand my own heart. I have no doubt but I could marry in a manner equal to my &s;ituation in life, were I di&s;po&s;ed to accept any of the offers made to me of late; but this is not agreeable to my pre&s;ent feelings. It is not, there|fore, barely for a companion, but for the man whom I love, that I would change my &s;ituation. And now, perhaps, I &s;hall be obliged to ta&s;te the bitter cup, which I have turned out to others&mdash;I mean a denial of your affections. But, O Sir, think not of me as I have fooli&s;hly thought of others in like circum&s;tances, that it is a &s;light of fancy, and not love, which &s;o powerfully moves and agitates my &s;oul. Sure I am, I never had that love for any man, while in a &s;ingle &s;tate, which now glows in my wounded heart for you. But what am I doing? In days pa&s;t my indigna|tion has been fired again&s;t tho&s;e ladies, who, &s;in|gle, had openly expre&s;&s;ed their affections for any particular man; and indeed, my rea&s;on now con|demns this practice as imprudent: But love, all powerful love, triumphs over rea&s;on, judgment and education. My heart is engaged, and I mu&s;t go through with the bu&s;ine&s;s. Dear Sir, be &s;o kind as to inform me, whether you are under any particular engagement to any of my &s;ex? If you are, I am undone&punc; If you are not, I &s;hall &s;till hope for happine&s;s in this life. I &s;hall be in the

That a per&s;on of your birth, education, character and circum&s;tan|ces in life, &s;hould write to one in my &s;ituation on &s;o tender and delicate a &s;ubject as love, is in|deed not unworthy of &s;everal notes of admira|tion. That fooli&s;h mode&s;ty, fear and ba&s;hful|ne&s;s, which prevents your &s;ex from di&s;clo&s;ing the tender emotions of their hearts to gentlemen of character, has ever appeared to me an imperfec|tion. I confe&s;s, the tyrannical laws of cu&s;tom, however, in many ca&s;es, have put it out of their power to do this with &s;o much &s;afety and honour as the rights of women demand. A&s;ide from this, I can &s;ee no more impropriety in a lady's communicating her thoughts on love to a gen|tleman of character, than there is in a gentleman's communicating his thoughts on the &s;ame &s;ubject to a lady of character: Therefore I beg you would give your&s;elf no unea&s;ine&s;s on the account of the innocent freedom you have taken in writ|ing to me on the mo&s;t tender and delicate &s;ub|ject that ever employed the pen of either men or women. It is evident to my mind, notwith&s;tand|ing all your notes of admiration and mode&s;t apol|ogies, that had not the &s;ecret &s;entiments of your heart been &s;imilar to mine, on this &s;ubject your addre&s;s would have never &s;een the light. In|clination, honour and piety con&s;train me to deal generou&s;ly with you, Madam: I mu&s;t, therefore, let you know, that my circum&s;tances in life are &s;uch as forbid my marrying &s;o &s;oon as perhaps would be agreeable to you.

<P>THIS day your endearing favour came fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> to hand, and met with the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">inde&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eption.

Your letter, Sir, has bani&s;hed all &s;uch apprehen&s;ions from my troubled brea&s;t, and ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">|ed the tumults of my bleeding heart. My affec|tion for you, Sir, is truly great; and had I not been con&s;cious of violating the tyrannical laws of cu&s;tom, my addre&s;s would not have been in|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">lard<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d with &s;o many notes of admiration. Not|with&s;tanding this conce&s;&s;ion, I mu&s;t do my&s;elf the ju&s;tice to affirm, that I am not wholly unac|quainted with tho&s;e delicate feelings which are always put on the rack, when a mode&s;t lady de|clares
<PB N="61" REF="028341_0056_0FD8B16353D8C7B0">
her affections for any particular gentle|man&mdash;I mean in an unmarried &s;tate. What mor|tifies me mo&s;t of all is, that upon &s;o &s;light an ac|quaintance, I &s;hould &s;uffer my heart &s;o quick to to be carried away with your charms&mdash;and my pen &s;o &s;oon to di&s;clo&s;e the melancholy tale. Be a&s;&s;ured, Sir, nothing alloys my anxiety on this &s;ubject &s;o much as the te&s;timony of my own con|&s;cience, that I have acted in &s;incerity. Your &s;trictures on the tyrannical laws of cu&s;tom are, in my opinion, ju&s;t; and indeed are &s;uch as have not unfrequently occurred to my own mind when reflecting on this &s;ubject. Were women allowed the &s;ame liberty to communicate their affections to men, as men are to communicate theirs to the women&mdash;I believe unhappy matches would be le&s;s numerous. One thing is certain, I &s;hall now have no rea&s;on to reproach my&s;elf with the ne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">glect of any mean I thought ju&s;tifiable to obtain a gentleman for my companion, for whom I had the highe&s;t e&s;teem and the mo&s;t unbounded af|fection. Your conde&s;cen&s;ion in &s;tating your ob|jections again&s;t altering your &s;ituation &s;oon, gives me both plea&s;ure and pain; plea&s;ure to find you &s;o obliging and &s;incere; and pain le&s;t &s;ome one or more of the&s;e objections may prove an in&s;ur|mountable ob&s;tacle to my happine&s;s: Politene&s;s and &s;incerity are not unfrequent inducements to love; and in this in&s;tance I feel their influence mo&s;t &s;en&s;ibly: However, I cannot forbear &s;mil|ing at one of your ingenious objections again&s;t &s;oon entering the conjugal &s;tate. No wonder you imagine me di&s;po&s;ed to marry &s;oo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">er than you are inclined to do&mdash;My letter has given you
<PB N="62" REF="028341_0057_0FD8B164C0761A60">
&s;ufficient rea&s;on to draw this conclu&s;ion: But, dear Sir, I am unfeignedly &s;incere in the decla|ration of my affection for you&mdash;and will now tell you, that I will wait for you any period of time you may think proper to propo&s;e; provided you can a&s;&s;ure me, you are under no engagement to any of my &s;ex, and will attend to my reque&s;t, which to me is a &s;ubject of the la&s;t importance. In the mean time I mu&s;t let you know, Sir, that I never &s;hall con&s;ent to match with any per&s;on living&mdash;no, not even with your&s;elf, whom I love almo&s;t to di&s;traction, without ample evidence of being loved by the &s;ame. Where affections are not reciprocal, there can be nothing of the deli|cate nature of &s;ocial and refined happine&s;s. Va|rious circum&s;tances have led me to conclude you have &s;ome e&s;teem of and love for my per&s;on: This conclu&s;ion emboldened me to addre&s;s you in the manner I have done, and yet I am afraid my un|guarded expre&s;&s;ions will le&s;&s;en your affections for me. I mu&s;t be indulged in hoping you will never improve my freedom to the injury of my character, whether you finally comply with my propo&s;als or not.

<P>YOUR favour of the 13th in&s;tant, came &s;afe to hand on the la&s;t Sabbath. I &s;hould have an|&s;wered it before now had it been in my power. La&s;t Saturday, as you have doubtle&s;s heard, I was taken down with my old di&s;order, the intermitting fever.&mdash;This turn of the fever has proved more &s;evere than any I have experienced heretofore.

What I mo&s;t earne&s;tly de&s;ire of you, is, that you would accompany me to the paradi&s;e above&mdash;where immortal youth blooms&mdash;love tri|umphs&mdash;and every tear is wiped away: Though the road which leads thither, is &s;trait and narrow, yet it deprives us of no plea&s;ures, but &s;uch as are beneath the dignity of man&mdash;&s;uch as are low, vi|cious and diabolical.

<P>Pau&s;e then, a moment, my deare&s;t creature, and &s;et the excellencies of real religion before your eyes; perhaps they may &s;way your mind to a life of humility and undi&s;&s;embled piety, which is of more value than all this wide world affords.

<P>YOUR long and entertaining letter of the 14th of the la&s;t month, I have received with pe|culiar plea&s;ure; and now embrace the fir&s;t mo|ment which pre&s;ents, to make out &s;ome kind of an&s;wer to it.

Pardon my imperfections, and you will &s;ecure my heart. I am heartily rejoiced my honoured papa has been &s;o good as to inform you of my welfare. I have written and thrown away &s;everal letters &s;ince my &s;ickne&s;s; the rea&s;on of this conduct has been altogether owing to my

want of opportunity to convey them to you; and it is entirely uncertain whether this ever reaches you; therefore you will accept of a &s;hort and imperfect an&s;wer. Be a&s;&s;ured, that it is with no &s;mall plea&s;ure, that I find my&s;elf able to inform you that my health is perfectly re&s;tored. Oh how thankful ought I to be to the great di&s;po&s;er of all events, for this di&s;play of his goodne&s;s and mercy to an unworthy wretch. Many, many of my fellow mortals have been cut down as cum|bers of the earth, and lodged in the &s;ilent grave, &s;ince I was fir&s;t &s;eized with my late bodily indi&s;|po&s;ition. O Emilius! help me to prai&s;e the great pre&s;erver of man, for his di&s;tingui&s;hing goodne&s;s to an unworthy and helple&s;s creature.

One thing, however, you may de|pend upon as fact; and that is, I have never had more &s;erious thoughts on the great and important things of real religion, than I have had during my late &s;ickne&s;s: And to tell you the truth, your piou&s; letter has largely contributed to increa&s;e the&s;e &s;olemn impre&s;&s;ions on my naturally vain and trifling mind; but I am afraid they will &s;oon wear away, and leave me wor&s;e than they found me. Oh the wretched influence of this vain and un&s;atisfactory world! How powerfully it allure<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> our imaginations, and commands our affections. O Emilius, on the&s;e accounts I &s;hould be more happy to &s;ee you, than ever I have been h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">reto|fore.

<P>UPON the reception of the above letter, Emilius concluded to drop his important and delightful &s;tudies, and &s;pend a few weeks with his enchanting Oliva, from whom he had endured an ab&s;ence &s;o long and painful. At their meeting, their mutual joys were expre&s;&s;ed, not by the cold and lifele&s;s language, which mere words compo&s;e&mdash;but by &s;parkling eyes, glowing countenances, and actions the mo&s;t polite and endear|ing.

The pious and dignified conduct of Emilius, on this occa&s;ion, was too per&s;picuous to pa&s;s unno|ticed by the honoured parents of Oliva, who now be|gan to feel them&s;elves happy in their daughter<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s con|nection with a gentleman of &s;o much worth: Every thing, of cour&s;e, con&s;pired to render them as happy in each others company as they could rea&s;onably wi&s;h.

Be &s;o kind as to free me from the&s;e per|plexing thoughts, by a long letter filled with your &s;entiments upon the mo&s;t important &s;ubject&mdash;I mean religion.

<P>I can never be thankful enough for that un|wearied and generous pains you have &s;o long taken to render my per&s;on, mind and carriage, agreeable to men of ta&s;te, virtue and refinement; as well as for that concern you have exhibited for my happine&s;s beyond this tran&s;itory &s;tate: the&s;e things I &s;hall &s;et down as real tokens of friend&s;hip.

<P>I HAVE had the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing Mr. P&mdash;m, who lately came from B&mdash;m; and who, in his blunt way of talking, tells me that my &s;weet|heart is unwell. I a&s;ked him what he meant&mdash; He an&s;wered, Mi&s;s <HI>Oliva</HI> is pining, and&punc; I be|lieve, unwell; and this was all I could get out of the philo&s;opher on this &s;ubject, except that you looked unwell. I then told him, if you in fact were unwell, I &s;hould have &s;uppo&s;ed you would have written me on the &s;ubject, which you had not done. He an&s;wered, delicate ladies are not apt to communicate all their feelings to their &s;uitors. Upon the whole, he talked with me till I heartily wi&s;hed my&s;elf at B&mdash;m&mdash;where I might judge of the health of my deare&s;t friend.

<P>NOT long after the preceding letter was written, Emilius vi&s;ited the di&s;con&s;olate parents of his depart|ed Oliva. The &s;cene was truly affecting to all who beheld it. The good Mr. Calybs and his lady re|ceived Emilius with all the demon&s;trations of love that tender parents could receive a &s;on who had been long ab&s;ent. They mingled &s;orrows with joys; their hearts bled; their tears flowed, till weeping could be endured no longer. At this &s;olemn and tender interview, Mr. Calybs delivered Emilius the forego|ing letters, which he had written to Oliva; togeth|er with that which Oliva had written and directed to Emilius but a few days before her exit. The emotions of Emilius' heart, on reading this letter, exceeded all de&s;cription.</P>
<P>The next day the whole family of Mr. Calybs went, in company with Emilius, to mourn over the grave of his Oliva. No language can expre&s;s the &s;orrows of Emilius heart on this &s;olemn and tremen|dous occa&s;ion.

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. Of the Court&s;hip of <HI>BRAGADOTIUS</HI> and <HI>NUM|SKULDIA.&mdash;Not</HI> for example&mdash;but warning.</HEAD>
<P>THE following anecdotes of the actual Court&s;hip of Bragadotius and Num&s;kuldia, are recorded, not for the example, but for the amu&s;e|ment of the American youth.</P>
<P>As to parentage, education, turns of mind, and cour&s;es of conduct, Bragadotius and Num&s;kul|dia, were much on a level. At an early period in life they formed an acquaintance, which final|ly i&s;&s;ued in what they e&s;teemed <HI>love</HI>&mdash;and marri|age was its con&s;equence.</P>
<P>While Bragadotius viewed him&s;elf the mo&s;t accompli&s;hed young gentleman within the circle of his acquaintance&mdash;Num&s;kuldia con&s;idered her|&s;elf a lady inferiour to none, within the circle of her knowledge. Bragadotius, without coun&s;el, felt him&s;elf equal to the important tru&s;t of pro|viding a companion every way &s;uited to his ta&s;te and views in life: and Num&s;kuldia became the
<PB N="130" REF="028341_0125_0FD8B044A0AD5370">
object of his highe&s;t ambition. For notwith|&s;tanding many fair creatures fell under the notice of his eye, none appeared to him &s;o charming, none proved &s;o captivating, as his incomparable Num&s;kuldia. Contrary to the whole&s;ome coun|&s;els and &s;olemn commands of his parents, Braga|dotius was frequently out whole nights on what he called his own bu&s;ine&s;s. Sometimes he was obliged to break open his father's hou&s;e; at others he was nece&s;&s;itated to take up his lodgings with the cattle in the barn, or &s;ome out hou&s;e, till the day broke and the family were up.</P>
<P>The amorous Num&s;kuldia was under le&s;s re|&s;traints, than her beloved Bragadotius; which frequently chagrined, and pained him to the very heart. Bragadotius and Num&s;kuldia were equal as to religion; for neither they nor their parents had the lea&s;t appearance of any &s;uch thing.</P>
<P>The following is an Epi&s;tolary corre&s;pondence which pa&s;&s;ed between them during their court|&s;hip.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. Of the <HI>Court&s;hip</HI> of <HI>PARAMOND</HI> and <HI>MATILDA</HI> &mdash;the former an old <HI>Bachelor,</HI> and the latter an old <HI>Maid.</HI></HEAD>
<P>PARAMOND was a bachelor of about fifty; who, notwith&s;tanding his large intere&s;t, had all his life feared to marry, le&s;t he &s;hould not be able to &s;upport his family in that &s;plendor he wi&s;hed. He was a man of as good character as one could expect for a bachelor. His per&s;on was not ungraceful, though not very beautiful; his manners acceptable, allowing for the oddities peculiar to bachelors: And notwith&s;tanding all the&s;e things, he firmly adopted a re&s;olution to change his &s;ituation.</P>
<P>What puzzled him more than every thing el&s;e, was whether he &s;hould woo a young girl, an old maid&punc; of widow. After &s;everal years reflection&mdash; for bachelors' thoughts run not very rapidly&mdash;he came to the conclu&s;ion to marry an old maid; and in the whole circle of his acquaintance (which
<PB N="144" REF="028341_0139_0FD8B0641C64DC20">
was by no means contracted) he could not find a fairer candidate for his affections than <HI>Matilda. Matilda</HI> was a lady of good family, and of a mo&s;t excellent character; &s;he was in reality exceed|ingly clever&mdash;but not hand&s;ome. Her good fa|ther left her po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a fortune of about four thou&s;and pounds; which rendered her more beautiful in the eyes of Paramond than any per|&s;onal qualification whatever could have done.</P>
<P>At a certain wedding, Paramond and Matilda were rallied by &s;ome of the company then pre&s;ent, and put in mind of the propriety of their match|ing with each other. This &s;o emboldened Para|mond in the &s;ecret conclu&s;ions of his heart, that he &s;oon paid Matilda a vi&s;it in the character of a lover; which was received with that coldne&s;s and indifferency which are peculiar to old maids: However Paramond was not di&s;couraged, as the following corre&s;pondence will &s;hew.</P>

<SALUTE>Dear Matilda,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>FOR more than thirty years &s;ince, I have had a &s;ecret flame enkindled in my brea&s;t for your per&s;on. You may remember the &s;ilver &s;nuff box I had the plea&s;ure to pre&s;ent to you when we were children. The &s;parkling of your
<PB N="145" REF="028341_0140_0FD8B06A8B9BAE00">
eyes, on that occa&s;ion, wounded my heart, and it has never been healed from that day to this. Should you a&s;k the rea&s;on why I did not declare my pa&s;&s;ion before, I would an&s;wer becau&s;e it was very great. My circum&s;tances in life were then by no means affluent; and my love for you was too great to bring you (had it been in my power) into a &s;ituation in which you mu&s;t have lived in a &s;tyle le&s;s elegant than that in which you have been brought up. For more than thirty years it has been my con&s;tant &s;tudy, as well as labour, to lay up money for the &s;ole purpo&s;e of your &s;pend|ing it in my company. The great di&s;po&s;er of all events has &s;o far &s;ucceeded my worldly enter|prizes, that I am now worth about &s;ix thou&s;and pounds clear of all incumbrances: This, added to the generous portion which your honoured father has left to you, may, with mutual affec|tions for each other, render us happy for that lit|tle &s;pace of time we have to &s;pend in this world. I &s;ay that little &s;pace, for you mu&s;t know we can|not live long in this world.</P>
<P>Thus, my dear Matilda, I have &s;incerely open|ed my heart to you, and &s;hall wait with great anxiety, till you declare your &s;entiments upon this important and intere&s;ting matter. One thing more: It has always given me plea&s;ure to know that you have uniformly rejected the mo&s;t ad|vantageous propo&s;als of matrimony.</P>

Polymond &s;oon made him&s;elf acquainted with the circum&s;tances of the charming Sylvia, and found them to be &s;uch, as emboldened him to make her overtures of e&s;|teem, friend&s;hip and love; and accordingly &s;pent &s;everal afternoons in her company.

<P>YOUR an&s;wer to my la&s;t has met with my ap|probation and e&s;teem. I was not wholly unapprized of your circum&s;tances, and therefore am not &s;hocked to hear them painted in the blacke&s;t colours. I knew you had four children, on who&s;e welfare your heart has been ju&s;tly fix|ed.</P>
<P>That you have never thought of marrying &s;ince the departure of your worthy companion, is not &s;trange; and is no rea&s;on I &s;hould not put &s;uch a thought into your mind.</P>
<P>I will a&s;&s;ure you, that it is far from my mind to entertain the lea&s;t thought of marrying you, without making hand&s;ome provi&s;ion for your children; and likewi&s;e recommending my&s;elf to your ta&s;te.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to a man's loving a &s;econd wo|man well enough to render the married &s;tate de|&s;irable, I mu&s;t &s;ay, I have never had the lea&s;t doubt of &s;uch a thing. The be&s;t proof, howev|er, of this is drawn from men of virtue and in|tegrity, who have had experience. As to my|&s;elf, I have been once married, and loved my wife as well as I wi&s;h ever to love any body; and I know that I loved &s;everal young ladies be|fore her, with the &s;ame kind of affection, and to the &s;ame degree, before ever I &s;aw her.</P>
<P><PB N="159" REF="028341_0154_0FD8B08674E7DA90">Doctor B&mdash;, a gentleman of known integri|ty and unblemi&s;hed piety, told me a few days &s;ince, that he had buried four companions, which were &s;o equal in his affections, that were they all now alive, and pre&s;ented before him, as they were the moment he gave them his hand; and he to loo&s;e his life, if he did not &s;ay which he preferred&mdash;he &s;hould not be able to do it&punc;</P>
<P>The idle fancy, therefore, of men and women not being capable of e&s;teeming and loving &s;eve|ral per&s;ons in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion well enough for marri|age, is what no per&s;on of &s;en&s;e will build upon.

<OPENER><SALUTE>Lovlie&s;t of Women,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM charmed with your piety&mdash;with that ten|der regard you have for your children, and that &s;acred re&s;pect you pay to religion; and therefore there was no need of your a&s;king par|don for dwelling upon the&s;e great and intere&s;t|ing &s;ubjects. It is with real plea&s;ure, I comply with your pious and rational reque&s;t, in giving you a &s;ummary of my religious &s;entiments.</P>
<P>My parents were chri&s;tians, who lived in the &s;trict ob&s;ervance of all the duties&punc; and doctrines taught by <HI>Calvin,</HI> that eminent mini&s;ter of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and reformer of the chri&s;tian church.&mdash; The religious &s;entiments which I, for my&s;elf, have adopted, comprehend the leading ideas of Calvini&s;m&mdash;and differ from him in nothing ex|cept &s;everal incon&s;i&s;tences, which he either had not time or wi&s;dom to rectify.</P>
<P>True religion, in my opinion, con&s;i&s;ts in a conformity of mind, heart, and life, to the law of God and go&s;pel of Je&s;us Chri&s;t.&mdash; In the mid&s;t of that almo&s;t infinite variety of &s;entiments, this, my deare&s;t Sylvia, is all that I call religion; every thing el&s;e, in my opinion, being idolatry, &s;uper&s;tition, enthu&s;ia&s;m and will-wor&s;hip.</P>
<P>All the &s;chemes of religion, ever yet publi&s;hed to the world of mankind, may be denominated
<PB N="162" REF="028341_0157_0FD88BF33B24C710">
&s;elfi&s;h, or benevolent.&mdash;Under the head of &s;elfi&s;h religion, may be comprehended every fal&s;e &s;cheme of religion which has ever taken place in the world.&mdash;Under that of benevolence, we may &s;ay of true religion, that it is a religion which is derived from and &s;upported by the &s;criptures of the old and new te&s;tament. This is the religion which I profe&s;s to believe and practi&s;e, and up|on which I mean to venture my &s;oul into the world of &s;pirits&mdash;for it bears the image of its ori|ginal, the great author of the univer&s;e.</P>
<P>But the Apo&s;tle &s;ays, <HI>Sanctify the Lord God in your hearts; and be ready always to give an an&s;wer to every man that a&s;keth you a rea&s;on of your hope that is in you, with meekne&s;s and fear.</HI></P>
<P>That boa&s;ting and proud mode of giving a relation of what is called religious experiences, too frequently practi&s;ed among the warm and de|vout, is in my opinion, an abomination to the great God, and all good men.</P>
<P>With meekne&s;s and fear, therefore, I would now give you the following rea&s;on of my hope that I am an heir of the grace of God.</P>
<P>I now perfectly remember that when I was a|bout &s;even years of age, after hearing one of my parents commend me, together with my brethren and &s;i&s;ters, to the grace of God, that I was ex|ceedingly affected with a &s;en&s;e of my own vile|ne&s;s. I really felt my&s;elf an exceedingly vile and unworthy creature in the &s;ight of God&mdash;be|fore whom I had been u&s;ually called to bow my|&s;elf morning and evening. This idea grew up|on me for more than ten years&mdash;I found my&s;elf
<PB N="163" REF="028341_0158_0FD9BA9F0C0D05A0">
a wretch undone; for notwith&s;tanding I had been taught, and knew my duty, &s;uch was the pride of my unhumbled and un&s;anctified heart, that I loved not the things which my rea&s;on and con|&s;cience told me were mo&s;t excellent. Sometimes I was gay and airy; but never without &s;ome re|flection.</P>
<P>When I was about twenty years of age, it plea&s;ed the great di&s;po&s;er of all things (as I hum|bly hope) to change the temper of my heart. I remember perfectly well (which is not probably the ca&s;e with every one) the place and time when I fir&s;t di&s;covered a change in my di&s;po&s;i|tion and feelings of &s;oul.&mdash;I felt deeply impre&s;&s;|ed with a &s;en&s;e of the righteou&s;ne&s;s of the great Governor of the univer&s;e; and with the exceed|ing vilene&s;s of my own conduct in life&mdash;though I have been &s;o happy as to e&s;cape tho&s;e blots and blurs, which bla&s;t the characters of many of my fellow-citizens&mdash;I found enough in my char|acter and heart to fill me with blu&s;hing and con|fu&s;ion.</P>
<P>About this time, I felt an uncommon di&s;po&s;i|tion to take blame and &s;hame to my&s;elf, for all my former conduct towards my creator; and was mo&s;t &s;incerely di&s;po&s;ed to cen&s;ure and con|demn my&s;elf as a &s;inner before heaven. Now my conduct appeared infinitely more vile than ever it had done before; and I felt my&s;elf eve|ry way undone&mdash;and began to feel in &s;uch de&s;|pair as words cannot de&s;cribe. In the mid&s;t of this di&s;tre&s;s and horror of &s;oul, I was, in infinite mercy, favoured with a fre&s;h idea of the glori|ous go&s;pel of Je&s;us Chri&s;t.&mdash;The glorious Re|deemer
<PB N="164" REF="028341_0159_0FD88BFFE7ED34E8">
appeared ju&s;t &s;uch a &s;aviour as I need|ed; and I thought I could with the greate&s;t plea&s;ure, yield my all up into his hands, without any re&s;erve, for time and eternity. Since that time, the wor&s;hip of God&mdash;his friends&mdash;his ordi|nances, and precepts, have been my delight.</P>
<P>In about twelve months after I ob&s;erved this alteration in my heart and life, I joined my&s;elf to a congregational church of Chri&s;t, with which I have lived in the greate&s;t harmony for a num|ber of years pa&s;t. With great plea&s;ure I have put my children under the watch and care of the church, with whom I am in covenant.</P>
<P>Thus, my deare&s;t Sylvia, I have given you a &s;ummary of my religious &s;entiments; and, I hope, with meekne&s;s and fear, added a relation of my religious experiences. If I know my own heart, I mu&s;t &s;ay, there is nothing in the whole circle of creation, which appears of more value, than real religion&punc; it is in very deed <HI>the one thing needful.</HI> And to tell you the truth, all per&s;onal charms are of little value, where religion is de|&s;pi&s;ed. My former companion was a per&s;on of univer&s;ally acknowledged wit and beauty: but her piety added ten thou&s;and charms to all her other excellencies&mdash;her la&s;t words to me were, "Polymond, if you ever &s;hould marry again, &s;ee to it, that you match with a lady of virtue and piety&mdash;and may the great di&s;po&s;er of all things direct you in the pathway of life."</P>

<P>FAIRSHUTE was a gentleman of about &s;eventy five years of age, who had been favour|ed with two wives: by the fir&s;t he had &s;everal children; by the &s;econd he had none.

<OPENER><SALUTE>Charming creature,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR letter has given me more plea&s;ure than you can cleverly conceive. It is not un|common for young ladies to feel &s;hocked at the fir&s;t propo&s;als of matrimony, e&s;pecially when they come from an unexpected quarter. Mr. Peter Mean&s;omething &s;ays you look &s;erious and very thoughtful, and thinks my propo&s;als are the principal cau&s;e of this uncommon appearance. Remember, my dear Shutefair, the moment you con&s;ent to write your name Fair&s;hute in&s;tead of Shutefair, you become the mi&s;tre&s;s of my hou&s;e, and heir of my whole e&s;tate. I would moreover inform you, that I am by no means &s;o debilitated as King David was, when Bi&s;hag the Shunamite was placed in his bo&s;om; for my eye-&s;ight has not &s;o failed me, that I cannot di&s;cern a great difference between you and any other lady in town.

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII. The Court&s;hip of <HI>DAMON</HI> and <HI>HARRIOT.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>DAMON</HI>&mdash;an American youth&mdash;was twen|ty-one years of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ge, when he became the humble &s;ervant of <HI>Harriot.</HI> He was the olde&s;t &s;on of a reputable Clergymen; educated in the chri&s;tian religion. However, during his re&s;idence at the Univer&s;ity, from under the eye of his pious father, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e contracted &s;entiments and habits quite incon|&s;i&s;tent with the chri&s;tian religion, and returned home a fini&s;hed Dei&s;t; which almo&s;t broke the hearts of his exemplary and pious parents. Not|with&s;tanding all this, Damon was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;uch a degree of beauty, &s;en&s;e, mode&s;ty and po|litene&s;s, as never failed to gain him the e&s;teem of tho&s;e who beheld him&mdash;e&s;pecially the e&s;teem of the fair &s;ex. Harriot, upon her fir&s;t acquaint|ance with Damon, was turned of eighteen. She was the only child of a rich and reputable mer|chant, and of cour&s;e heir to a very hand&s;ome for|tune; her education was liberal for a female, and very particular in matters of chri&s;tianity.
<PB N="178" REF="028341_0173_0FD8B0AB5E38D100">
Though Harriot was no beauty&punc; yet, in her pre|&s;ence, it was not uncommon for beauties to be|come di&s;&s;atisfied with them&s;elves. Harriot was one of tho&s;e rare per&s;ons, the &s;econd &s;ight of whom, always charms more than the fir&s;t. She dre&s;&s;es with &s;ingular grace, always intermingling &s;implicity with elegance. Her ambition is to know what mo&s;t becomes the fair &s;ex, in every &s;tation of life; and her ruling pa&s;&s;ion the love of virtue. She is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a tender, mode&s;t, del|icate and benevolent heart. The peculiar turn of her mind is cheerfulne&s;s, unallied to vanity. She always appears plea&s;ed, at the &s;tated returns of her &s;ea&s;ons of devotion.</P>
<P>Damon and Harriot formed their fir&s;t acquaint|ance with each other, at a public entertainment. Damon, having entered the parlour, indulged his eye indifferently to wander over a numerous cir|cle of beautiful and well dre&s;&s;ed ladies; in the mid&s;t of whom his attention was irri&s;i&s;tably fixed on the incomparable Harriot&mdash;who&s;e pene<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ing eye &s;oon perceived her&s;elf the object of Da|mon's admiration. Both bru&s;hed, and in vein &s;trove to hide from the company the impre&s;&s;ions a &s;ight of each other had made upon their ten|der and yielding hearts. The very next day, Damon found means to introduce him&s;elf to Har|riot as a courtier, and met with her mode&s;t ap|probation. The following corre&s;pondence will di&s;play before the reader, their &s;entiments, their love, and the ob&s;tacles which lay in their way&punc; for a long time, of matching with each other.</P>
<P><PB N="179" REF="028341_0174_0FD8B0B15718C010">Damon having cho&s;en the &s;tudy of law, as the high road to political preferment, was obliged to re&s;ide at &s;ome con&s;iderable di&s;tance from his be|loved Harriot, and therefore commenced the &s;ub&s;equent corre&s;pondence.</P>

<P>YOUR obliging and delicate letter has filled my heart with more plea&s;ure than I can command language to expre&s;s. The line of con|duct you formerly adopted, and con&s;tantly pur|&s;ued, was undoubtedly judicious for the time of life in which it &s;ub&s;i&s;ted. But all general rules have &s;ome exceptions; and I am happy to find, that in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e you have laid hold of one &s;o much in my favour. Be a&s;&s;ured, dear Madam, your confidence in me &s;hall never be abu&s;ed. I mo&s;t heartily confe&s;s, that the language of flatte|ry is too often u&s;ed to the ladies as the language of politene&s;s. For, upon recollection, I find that I have in &s;everal in&s;tances been guilty of this un|gentleman-like conduct to the ladies. This is a folly which &s;hows the great importance of exam|ining general cu&s;toms, and &s;huning tho&s;e things, which, tho' cu&s;tomary, are really unrighteous and abu&s;ive. But in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, you mu&s;t give me leave to a&s;&s;ure you&punc; that my pen and heart have exactly corre&s;ponded with each other. And to convince you of the &s;incerity of this declara|tion, I will wait on time and &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">rounding circum|&s;tances as far as the fervent emotions of my &s;oul will admit.

<OPENER><SALUTE>Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN my la&s;t, I engaged to give you the rea&s;ons of my faith in Revelation. In doing which I mu&s;t be excu&s;ed from any thing more than a bare &s;tatement of them; for a f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ll illu&s;tration of them would require a volume of many pages.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t rea&s;on of my faith, in Revelation is founded on the circum&s;tances of mankind, who are de&s;titute of what, enlightened chri&s;tians plead, is a revelation from God. The&s;e are, in my view, evidently &s;uch as demon&s;trate that human nature, una&s;&s;i&s;ted by &s;upernatural aid, is in a mo&s;t deplorable &s;ituation. The con&s;equence mu&s;t be that &s;uch &s;upernatural aid is truly de&s;irable.&mdash; When we contemplate the &s;ituation of the mo&s;t enlightened and improved nations on earth, who are de&s;titute of Revelation, the idea that the light of nature needs the a&s;&s;i&s;tanee of Revelation, ru&s;hes in upon our minds with irre&s;i&s;table force&punc; I need not inform you, Sir, (who&s;e mind is open to the various &s;ituations of tho&s;e nations, which are de&s;titute of Revelation) that not one of the&s;e nations have ever been known to form and em|brace a &s;cheme of religion which would bear the te&s;t of common &s;en&s;e: Witne&s;s the religions of the Pagan world; yea, all the &s;chemes of religion which have not been founded on revelation&mdash; the gro&s;&s;e&s;t idolatry&mdash;the greate&s;t inju&s;tice, as well as the m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;t immoral and ob&s;cene conduct, have been celebrated as acts of virtue and reli|gion.
<PB N="193" REF="028341_0188_0FD8B0D0AF3FE6C8">
Thus the world by wi&s;dom, or philo&s;ophy, knew not God.</P>
<P N="2">2. By contemplating the character of the one living and true God, I find it is not incon&s;i&s;tent with his perfections, to grant unto his depraved and benighted creature, man, an expre&s;s revela|tion of his mind and will. For if the great char|acteri&s;tic of the Deity be goodne&s;s, and if the circum&s;tances of men be &s;uch as call for &s;uch aid as a revelation from God&mdash;then his character cannot be impeached, provided he &s;hould give men &s;uch a revelation. The objection again&s;t the bible's being a revelation from God, becau&s;e it is not given to all the nations of the earth at once, cannot be admitted; for in this ca&s;e, we &s;hould be deprived of one of the greate&s;t argu|ments in favour of revelation, viz. the great need in which men &s;tood of it. The revelation no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> being &s;ent to all men at the &s;ame time; tho&s;e who enjoy it, may, by comparing them&s;elves with tho&s;e who do not, &s;ee in a more &s;triking manner, the ble&s;&s;ings of &s;uch a revelation, than otherwi&s;e it would be po&s;&s;ible for them to do. Now, if it can be made to appear, that the &s;crip<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tures of the old and new te&s;tament are &s;uch a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> aid to men as the circum&s;tances of mankind re|quired, and the character of God admitted to be given to them&mdash;I think we &s;hall have gained our point, that it is rational to believe that the Bible is a revelation from God.</P>
<P>This then is the <HI>third</HI> rea&s;on of my faith in re|velation, viz. That the &s;criptures of the old and new te&s;tament, are &s;uch a revelation of the mind and will of God, as the circum&s;tances of men re+quired,
<PB N="194" REF="028341_0189_0FD8B0D19D573B00">
and the holy character of the God of Nature would admit to b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> given to mankind.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not here &s;top to illu&s;trate this idea, but proceed immediately to give you a fourth rea&s;on of my faith in revelation; which is, That the &s;criptures of the old and new te&s;taments contain all the internal and external evidences of a reve|lation of the mind and will of God, any one could rea&s;onably expect or wi&s;h for.</P>
<P>Thus, Sir, you &s;ee the ground upon which I go. Be &s;o kind and generous as to examine each &s;tep with care and candor, and put me right where I have tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed the laws of rea&s;on and common &s;en&s;e.

<HEAD>LETTER XII. HARRIOT to DAMON.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN my la&s;t I endeavoured to &s;tate &s;ome of the fir&s;t principles of my faith in revelation. In this I &s;hall attempt &s;ome farther arguments in favour of the Bible's being the word of God.</P>
<P N="1">1. All the doctrines of the Bible are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ght rea&s;on. It is not denyed, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;ev|eral
<PB N="195" REF="028341_0190_0FD8B0D66BA2F1B8">
of them, however, are &s;uch as men in the exerci&s;e of rea&s;on, una&s;&s;i&s;ted by revelation could never have di&s;covered. B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t it is affirmed, that after their di&s;covery&mdash;though &s;everal of them are too great and &s;ublime for our &s;canty faculties to comprehend&mdash;yet none of them are contrary to right rea&s;on.&mdash;To exemplify&mdash;The law of God requires &s;upreme love to God, and impartial and univer&s;al love to mankind&mdash;which exactly cor|re&s;ponds with the dictates of right rea&s;on and with common &s;en&s;e. The &s;cheme of &s;alvation revealed in the Bible, though incomprehen&s;ible and undi&s;coverable by the light of nature, has been acknowledged con&s;onant to the dictates of right rea&s;on, by many of tho&s;e wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e rational powers are acknowledgely inferior to none of their fellow-creatures. Witne&s;s a <HI>Boyle,</HI> a <HI>Bacon,</HI> a <HI>Newton,</HI> an <HI>Addi&s;on,</HI> and ten thou&s;and more, who&s;e names are recorded in the annals of reli|gion and &s;ame.</P>
<P>Again, that true religion, according to the &s;criptures, con&s;i&s;ts in conformity to the moral law, which requires love to God and man, and compliance with the go&s;pel&mdash;which requires re|pentance towards God, and &s;aith in the Lord Je|&s;us Chri&s;t&mdash;together with a faithful ob&s;ervance of all the commandments and ordinances of God's hou&s;e, has been found by the generation of the righteous in all ages, to be con&s;onant to rea&s;on. The univer&s;ality and perfection of the divine go|vernment&mdash;a future &s;tate of rewards for the righ|teous, and puni&s;hment for the unrighteous which is &s;trictly eternal, are doctrines perfectly agree|able to rea&s;on. The particular doctrines of to|tal
<PB N="196" REF="028341_0191_0FD8B0D86476E278">
depravity, human dependence, and the &s;eve|ral operations of the &s;pirit of God, with all tho&s;e which are their con&s;equents, are &s;o evident to every judicious mind, that I need &s;ay nothing of their being con&s;onant to right rea&s;on.</P>
<P N="2">2. Another argument which I con&s;ider in fa|vour of the Bible's being the word of God, is the manner in which its doctrines were fir&s;t propa|gated. The writers of the &s;everal doctrines found in the holy &s;criptures, lived in different ages, and in different parts of the world; but all appear to &s;peak the &s;ame language, to be moved by the &s;ame Holy Gho&s;t; which could not have been the ca&s;e had they not been in&s;pired of God.&mdash; Moreover the propagation of the&s;e &s;entiments have not been accompli&s;hed by the powerful arm of the civil law&mdash;by the dint of the &s;word; their intrin&s;ic excellency has been felt and ac|knowledged by thou&s;ands. The &s;pirit of God has evidently attended the reading and preaching of the great truths of the go&s;pel, to the comfort and &s;alvation of thou&s;ands who have been favor|ed with them.</P>
<P>Moreover, the original propagators of the doc|trines contained in the &s;criptures, were, generally &s;peaking, illiterate men; and con&s;equently un|furni&s;hed with the means of deceiving the world; and the doctrines which they preached and prac|ti&s;ed were, in every point of light, contrary to the ta&s;te of &s;elfi&s;h and wicked men. Their rapid &s;pread, therefore, mu&s;t be owing to the divine and not human agency.</P>
<P>A third argument in favour of the &s;cri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s being of a divine original, is, that their contents
<PB N="197" REF="028341_0192_0FD8B0DA00B6A9B8">
are of &s;uch a nature as far exceeds the highe&s;t &s;tretches of the mo&s;t exalted created minds and powers. All finite powers are confined to limits infinitely &s;hort of tho&s;e exalted and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">blime &s;tretches of thought exemplified in the &s;criptures of divine truth.</P>
<P N="4">4. The whole of the &s;criptures are delivered, not in the name of the penman, as would natu|rally have been the ca&s;e, provided they had not been of a divine original&mdash;but in the name of the God of Nature, who undoubtedly is their au|thor.</P>
<P N="5">5. Miracles, which were wrought in atte&s;tation of the truth of what the &s;acred penman wrote, are, notwith&s;tanding all the Dei&s;tical tribe have &s;aid and written to the contrary, a powerful ar|gument in favour of the divinity of the &s;criptures.</P>
<P N="6">6. The fulfilment of prophe&s;ies is an incon|te&s;tible and powerful argument that the Bible is the word of God.</P>
<P N="7">7. The re&s;urrection of Chri&s;t from the dead, mu&s;t be con&s;idered by all rational and candid minds in the &s;ame point of light&mdash;Chri&s;t had fore|told his death, and the time of his re&s;urrection&mdash; If this had failed of proving true, the &s;criptures mu&s;t have been given up as a delu&s;i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n&mdash;the en|emies of revelation would have had great rea&s;on to have triumphed over the friends to revelation and chri&s;tianity. Perhaps you will &s;ay, this de|pends on the &s;criptures them&s;elves. We ackn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">w|ledge that the &s;criptures do a&s;certain this great and glorious fact; and we moreover affirm th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> it is a&s;certained by human te&s;timony; and con|&s;equently
<PB N="198" REF="028341_0193_0FD8B0DB5FC1F970">
ought not to be rejected by any ration|al man.</P>
<P N="8">8. The internal evidences of the truth of the holy &s;criptures are very &s;ingular. The&s;e writ|ings, without exception, breath love and friend|&s;hip to God and man; they are &s;tamped with the marks of a divine original. We find men capa|ble of comprehending the works of genius and piety of a human kind; but where is the man to be found, who can gra&s;p the lofty extent of thought, the elevated and &s;ublime &s;tretch of &s;en|timent contained in the lively oracles of the liv|ing God? We look at them as we do at the ex|ten&s;ive and mighty ocean, and &s;ee a part, but not the whole of their meaning.</P>
<P>While the&s;e &s;acred writings have been hated and ridiculed by the vicious, they have always been e&s;teemed and loved by the generation of the righteous.</P>
<P>Thus, my dear Sir, I have given you &s;ome faint traces of the outlines of the rea&s;ons of my faith in revelation.</P>
<P>I advi&s;e you carefully to peru&s;e Kneeland's View of the Engli&s;h Dei&s;tical writers, and the &s;everal an&s;wers to Pain's Age of Rea&s;on&mdash;which might with more propriety, have been &s;tiled the Age of Folly.</P>

<P>Giving up then, the &s;entiment that all men &s;hall be &s;aved, I have come to a conclu&s;ion, that &s;al|vation is by the deeds of the law&mdash;for the righte|ous only &s;hall be &s;aved.&mdash;You mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible, however, that this idea of &s;alvation, mu&s;t be very alarming and painful, to one &s;o de&s;titute of righ|teou&s;ne&s;s as I am.

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Harriot,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I KNOW not that ever I &s;hall be otherwi&s;e than in the wrong. My early fixed deter|mination to &s;teer clear of &s;uper&s;tition and enthu|&s;ia&s;m, landed me in the deeps of Dei&s;m. Being driven from this ground by your ma&s;terly pen, I ha&s;tily adopted the idea of Univer&s;al Salvation but being convinced that this &s;entiment was un|&s;criptural and illu&s;ory, I fell into the Arminian &s;cheme, which promi&s;es &s;alvation to tho&s;e who are careful to obey the law; and of cour&s;e have been &s;eeking to e&s;tabli&s;h my own righteou&s;ne&s;s as my only ground of hope. But from your la&s;t, I perceive that I am &s;till in the wrong; and in|deed I find that my own righteou&s;ne&s;s is far from that which God requires of every rational crea|ture; and that there is no evidence from the Bible, that the righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t is de&s;igned only to patch up our filthy rags. I now know not which way to turn, unle&s;s it be to believe that I &s;hall be &s;aved, let me live and do as I may. And yet this &s;cheme of religion does by no means corre&s;pond with the dictates of my rea&s;on.</P>
<P><HI>Dear Harriot,</HI> be &s;o kind as to unbo&s;om your heart to your afflicted friend, on the all impor|tant &s;ubject of real religion; be not contented with telling me what is wrong, but tell likewi&s;e

<P>THE account which you give of your&s;elf is like that of a &s;lender barge to&s;&s;ed on the boi&s;terous waves of the raging &s;ea&mdash;always in danger, though &s;ometimes faintly hoping &s;oon to gain a &s;afe and commodious harbour.

<P><PB N="206" REF="028341_0201_0FD8AFB1525A2A78">Be a&s;&s;ured then, dear Sir, that the great ob&s;ta|cle, which lies in your way of under&s;tanding and believing the truth unto &s;alvation, is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ed in your own brea&s;t.

Believe me, Damon, it was this that blinded your eyes again&s;t the reality and glory of that revelation which the God of love has been plea&s;ed to make of his mind and will, in the &s;criptures of the old and new te&s;ta|ment. It was this wickedne&s;s of heart which led you to catch hold of that mi&s;taken idea of &s;alva|tion, which the Univer&s;ali&s;ts have pre&s;umptuou&s;|ly palmed on the holy &s;criptures. And after your good &s;en&s;e and uncommon talents had led you to give up the&s;e too often fatal delu&s;ions, it was the corruption of your own depraved heart, which &s;purre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> you on to embrace the Arminian notion of &s;alvation by the deeds of the law. And being again driven from the dangerous ground which you had incon&s;iderately taken, by the mighty power of truth&mdash;it was the &s;ame deceitful heart that led you, as your la&s;t re&s;ort, to the ab&s;urd and un&s;criptural &s;cheme of &s;alvation adopted by the Antinomians&mdash;which, give me leave to tell you, is no le&s;s foreign from the truth, than either of the former. Now, as the&s;e various &s;chemes of religion will by no means an&s;wer your pur|po&s;e, permit me in faithfulne&s;s to your be&s;t inter|e&s;t, to tell you, that your feet undoubtedly &s;tand on &s;lippery places.

<P>I THANK you for your acknowledgments of my &s;incere attempts to promote your be&s;t intere&s;ts. I am moreover exceedingly plea&s;|ed, that the truth has found you out&mdash;that in fact it has &s;howed your&s;elf to your&s;elf in any degree.

Remember, my dear friend, the human heart is deceitful above all things, and de&s;perately wicked. You &s;ay that you perceive it your duty to believe on the Sa|viour of men&mdash;but find your&s;elf unable to per|form this important ta&s;k.

<PB N="210" REF="028341_0205_0FD88BBB9DA94300">
&s;mall trouble. I mu&s;t, therefore, grudge no pains to free you from it.</P>
<P N="1">1. Be &s;o kind, Sir, as to reflect &s;eriou&s;ly upon the ab&s;urdity of any thing's being your duty which lies beyond the limits of your natural powers and faculties to perform.</P>
<P N="2">2. Carefully examine whether, &s;trictly &s;peak|ing, the great duties of repentance and faith, are of this kind?</P>
<P N="3">3. Carefully &s;ettle the matter, whether it be really a fact, that you feel your&s;elf under obliga|tions to exerci&s;e repentance towards God and faith in the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t immediately, or not?</P>
<P>Now, that I might contribute, as far as in me lies, to your properly &s;olving the&s;e momentuous que&s;tions&mdash;plea&s;e to attend to the following re|marks:</P>
<P N="1">1. There are many things incumbent upon men as duties, which they have no inclination to perform; but none which lie beyond the limits of their natural powers. The natural con&s;e|quence is, that the inability which men are under to obey God, mu&s;t be of a moral and not a natu|ral kind; and of cour&s;e wholly inexcu&s;able.&mdash; Hence</P>
<P N="3">3dly. The want of natural ability is the only thing which can excu&s;e us for the non-perform|ance of any thing which God commands.</P>
<P>But remember, dear Sir, a di&s;approbation of our wrong conduct towards God, lies within the limits of our natural powers and faculties; and of cour&s;e is a duty incumbent upon us&mdash;for the non-performance of which, we can have no rea|&s;onable
<PB N="211" REF="028341_0206_0FD8AFBC47CA9160">
excu&s;e. Therefore, we may ea&s;ily &s;ee, that when we feel it a duty to repent; and at the &s;ame time, feel no inclination to perform this du|ty, the difficuly lies not in the want of power, but in the want of inclination only&mdash;or in other words, in the po&s;itive and voluntary oppo&s;ition of our hearts again&s;t God. When you come care|fully to examine the&s;e matters, I believe you will find I am not out of the way in my thoughts on this great and intere&s;ting &s;ubject.

<OPENER><SALUTE>Charming Harriot,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I CAN never be thankful enough for that un|wearied pains you have taken to reform me in &s;entiment, in heart and in life. I now humbly hope, God has in reality ble&s;&s;ed your pious and unwearied labours, to my everla&s;ting good; and doubt not but he will reward you for the &s;ame in the coming world, to which we are ha&s;tening.&mdash; When I reflect upon the remaining corruptions of my heart, I feel that I ought to rejoice in my pro&s;pects of future glory, with fear and trem|bling; r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ling that none can be &s;aved, but tho&s;e who hold out to the end of life, in the exerci&s;e of every chri&s;tian grace and virtue.</P>
<P>And now, Harriot, I mu&s;t inform you, that I begin to find my&s;elf engaged in a warfare, of which previous to my change I had no idea. I find that I mu&s;t, in fact, fight not with fle&s;h and blood only, but with principalities and powers, with the rulers of the darkne&s;s of this world, or lo&s;e my &s;oul after all. Little did I think, in that happy moment, when, without re&s;erve, I gave my all into the hands of God, that I &s;hould &s;o &s;oon be called to put on the go&s;pel armour, and plunge into the battles of the Lord, the Captain and Bi&s;hop of my &s;oul. I find it impo&s;&s;ible for one, who is really embarked in the cau&s;e of the dear Redeemer, to live in this world without re|proach and per&s;ecution. My Dei&s;tical acquaint|ance have got &s;ome idea of my views of mind,

The followers of the Lamb of God &s;eek my company, and call me brother; they mark the change through which I have pa&s;&s;ed, and bid me God's &s;peed.</P>
<P>I am plea&s;ed with the change of company, which &s;eems to be the con&s;equence of my change of heart. But Oh, what will become of tho&s;e &s;prightly youths, who formerly were my deare&s;t companions? They certainly are in the gall of bitterne&s;s, and in the bonds of iniquity. Their feet &s;tand on &s;lippery places, and mu&s;t, unle&s;s &s;overeign grace prevent, &s;lide in due time. Oh that each of them had an Harriot, who&s;e in&s;truc|tions would be attended to out of love. I am determined to do all in my power to convince them of their errors, and per&s;uade them to em|brace the chri&s;tian religion. You will join with me in addre&s;&s;ing the throne of grace, night and day, with an expre&s;s view to their &s;alvation.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM extremely gratified with your la&s;t let|ter, becau&s;e&punc; it &s;peaks the language of the redeemed, &s;truggling through this vale of tears&mdash; to come off conquerors, yea more than conquer|ors, through him who hath loved and died for them. The effects of that change of &s;entiment and heart, you mention, are what I have been looking for, and &s;o far as they evidence the real|ity of your religion, rejoice at. I have felt &s;im|ilar ones pre&s;&s;ing upon my &s;pirits for more than eight years; and no wonder, for the Lord God, immediately after the fall of man, put enmity be|tween the &s;erpent and the woman whom he had deceived, and between his &s;eed and her &s;eed. Hence the righteous are an abomination to the wicked, and the wicked are an abomination to the righteous&mdash;and can no more have fellow&s;hip with each other, than Chri&s;t and Belial. Per&s;e|cution is the natural con&s;equence of the&s;e differ|ent natures; but let us be careful that we are re|proached and per&s;ecuted for nothing but well-doing&mdash;that we &s;uffer for righteou&s;ne&s;s &s;ake; then may we rejoice and be exceedingly glad, for great will be our reward in Heaven; for &s;o per&s;ecuted they the Prophets who were before us; yea our Lord and ma&s;ter him&s;elf.
