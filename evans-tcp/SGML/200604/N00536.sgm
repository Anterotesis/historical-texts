Whereas against such Treaties of Peace made between their Majesties and their Allies, several of their Majesties Subjects do continually sail under Com|missions of Forreign Princes and States, contrary to their Duty and good Allegiance, and by fair means cannot be restrained from so doing. Be it therefore Enacted by the Governor, Council and Assembly, and it is hereby Enacted by the Authority of the same, That from and after Publication hereof, it shall be Fellony for any Person which now doth or hereafter shall inhabit in or belong to this Province, to serve in <HI>America</HI> in an Hostile manner under any Forreign Prince, State or Potentate in Amity with their Majesties, without special Lisence for so doing, under the Hand and Seal of their Majesties Governor or Commander in Chief of this <HI>P</HI>rovince for the time being, and that all and every such Offender and Offenders, contrary to the true intent of this Act, being thereof duely convinced in their Majesties Court of Judi|cature within this Province (to which Courts Authority is hereby given, to hear and determine the same, as other cases of Fellony) shall suffer,

Provided nevertheless that this Act, nor any thing therein contained, shall <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> to any Person or Persons, which now are or have been in the Service or Imployment of any forreign Prince, State or Potentate whatsoever, that shall return to this Province, and leave and desert such Service and Imployment, before the first day of <HI>September</HI> next ensuing, rendring themselves to their Majesties Governour or Commander in Chief for the time being, and giving such Security as he shall appoint, for their future good Behaviour, and also that they shall not depart this Province without the Lisence of their Majesties Governour or Commander in chief.</P>
<P>And for the better and more speedy Execution of Justice upon such who having committed Pyracies, Fellonies, and other Offences upon the Sea, shall be apprehended in or brought prisoners to this Province, Be it further enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That all Fellonyes, Pyracies, Roberies, Murders, or Confederacies committed, that here-after shall be committed upon the Sea, or in any Haven, Creek or Bay, within the Jurisdiction of the Admirality, shall be enquired, tryed, heard, determined and judged in such Form as if such Offence had been committed in and upon the Land, and to that end and purpose Com|missions shall be had under their Majesties Seal of this Province, directed to the Judge or Judges of the Admirality of this <HI>P</HI>rovince for the time being, and to such other substantial persons, as by their Majesties Go|vernour or Commander in chief of this Province, for the time being, shall be named or appointed; which said Commissioners, or such a Quorum of them, as by such Commission shall be thereunto authorized, shall have full Power to do all things in and about the enquiry, hearing, determining, adjudging and punishing of any of the Crimes and Offences aforesaid, as any Commissioners appointed by Commission under the great Seal of <HI>England,</HI> by Virtue of a Statute made in the Twenty Eight Year of the Reign of King <HI>Henry</HI> the eight, are Im|powered to do and execute within the Kingdom of <HI>England.</HI> And that the said Offenders which are or shall be apprehended in or brought Prisoners to this Province, shall be lyable to such Order, Process, Judgment and Execution, by Virtue of such Commission to be grounded upon this Act, as might be awarded or given against them, if they were proceeded against within the Realm of <HI>England,</HI> by Virtue of any Commission grounded upon the said Statute.</P>
<P>Be it further Enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That all and every person or persons that shall any way knowingly entertain, harbour, conceal, trade, or hold any correspondence by Letters, or otherwise, with any person or persons that shall be deemed or judged to be Privateers, <HI>P</HI>yrates, or other Offenders within the Construction of this Act, and shall not readily endeavour, to the best of his <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> their power, to apprehend, or cause to be apprehended such <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> or Offenders, shall be lyable to be prosecuted against, as <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span">
