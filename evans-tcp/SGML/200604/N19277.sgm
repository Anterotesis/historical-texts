<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>IN the following pages, the Public, according to the promi&s;e of the Publi&s;hers, is pre&s;ented with a Volume of American Poems; partly Selected, and partly Original. In undertaking this Work, they have been actuated by a variety of motives, and drawn onward by a number of ob|jects. When looking round them, they &s;aw many Poems, written by the mo&s;t eminent American Authors, from the loo&s;e manner of their publi&s;hment, known only to a few of their particular acquaintance, and unheard of by the gene|rality of their Countrymen. The value of the perform|ances, and the regard which authors generally feel for their literary offspring, left them no room to doubt, but that, at &s;ome future period, each per&s;on would think it not un|worth the while to collect what he had &s;cattered. But this period was uncertain; and the publi&s;hers tho't that it would not be rendering an unacceptable &s;ervice to the Pub|lic, if they undertook the bu&s;ine&s;s of collecting, and arran|ging each Author's productions in a volume, which from its &s;ize &s;hould claim a more univer&s;al attention.&mdash;Be&s;ide the &s;maller Poems of Gentlemen, di&s;tingui&s;h'd for their poet|ical talents, many others, of very great merit, have ap|peared in the different Periodical publications of the United States. Performances of this kind, falling from the pens of per&s;ons not intent on literary fame; or intent on repu|tation different from poetical reputation; or who&s;e names have not yet been dignified by national applau&s;e; e&s;pecial|ly
<PB N="iv" REF="025104_0003_0FCE54276A1F91C0">
as many of them are adapted to particular and local oc|ca&s;ions; notwith&s;tanding their de&s;ert, are con&s;tantly lia|ble to be forgotten and lo&s;t. And the publi&s;hers have ob|&s;erved it to be a matter of much regret, among per&s;ons of reading and ta&s;te, that the frail &s;ecurity of an ob&s;cure news|paper, was the only one they had for &s;ome of the han&s;om|e&s;t &s;pecimens of American Poetry. To afford a &s;tronger, and more durable &s;ecurity, is one of the objects of this Publication.&mdash;Among other things, it did not appear to be a matter altogether de&s;titute of u&s;efulne&s;s, to bring togeth|er, in one view, the &s;everal poetical productions of the dif|ferent States. By this means a more certain e&s;timation can be made of the comparative merit of their various wri|ters; a more thorough acquaintance may be obtained of the &s;tate of the belles-lettres in the individual parts of the Uni|on; and hereby will be promoted a more intimate combi|nation of literary intere&s;ts.&mdash;It e&s;pecially &s;eemed a matter of importance, to draw forth, for the amu&s;ement of the lovers of poetry, tho&s;e Poems which, for want of a Repo&s;|itory of this kind, alone, were withheld from the Public. It was ea&s;y to fore&s;ee, that many per&s;ons, acting with a proper regard to the worth of their own writings, would readily give up that advantage, which news-papers be&s;tow, of having them known to every body; if they could by means of a Work like the pre&s;ent one, &s;ecure them a certain conveyance to the attention of the &s;cientific and refined. It was l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">kewi&s;e the wi&s;h of the Publi&s;hers, to excite the attention of tho&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of talents and lei&s;ure, to &s;imi|lar pur&s;uits; by holding out to them a Work where, uni|ted with the like performances of the mo&s;t celebrated among their Countrymen, their Poems may be equally &s;e|cure
<PB N="v" REF="025104_0004_0FCE54294EC9B4A0">
of pre&s;ervation and notice.&mdash;The&s;e have been the in|tentions of the Publi&s;hers. How far their de&s;ign is accom|pli&s;hed, is not for them to determine. That it &s;hould be completely &s;o, was not to be expected. This is but the be|ginning of an Undertaking; and they hope, not an un|promi&s;ing one. The Public alone, have the power to coun|tenance and &s;upport them in its accompli&s;hment.&mdash;Should the Volume, now publi&s;hed, meet with that &s;ucce&s;s which the value of the Poems it contains &s;eems to warrant, it is the intention of the Publi&s;hers to add another; and to con|tinue the Collection as long as the <HI>pre&s;ent &s;upply</HI> of Mate|rials, and <HI>that</HI> for which, in future, they may be indebt|ed to the genero&s;ity of the literarty, will enable them.</P>
<P>They have, now, only to return, to their &s;ub&s;cribers, their mo&s;t unfeignedly grateful acknowledgments for the generous &s;upport which they have afforded them; and to expre&s;s a hope, that tho' the publication owing to &s;ome unfortunate circum&s;tances, has been delayed longer than their fir&s;t purpo&s;e, no other expectation, which they have held forth, may be di&s;appointed on a careful examination of the Work.</P>

<HEAD>POSTSCRIPT.</HEAD>
<P>IT is the intention of the Editors, as mentioned in the Preface, to pur&s;ue their de&s;ign; and, &s;hould &s;ufficient encouragement appear, to publi&s;h a Se|cond Volume, in the cour&s;e of the next two years. &mdash;Many di&s;appointments, the ill health of one of the Editors, and other circum&s;tances, too complicated and painful to mention, have contributed to render their part of this Work le&s;s perfect than their ex|pectations, and promi&s;es. They intend to fini&s;h the &s;ucceeding Volume, or Volumes, in a more el|egant manner; and, if a &s;econd edition of the pre|&s;ent volume &s;hould be called for, it is their further intention to make it equal, in beauty, to the oth|ers; to all of which &s;uitable, and well-executed de|corations &s;hall be added.</P>

<Q>The inclo&s;ed Poem is handed you for publication. I have long thought that the Bible furni&s;hed many &s;ubjects for poetry, far more de&s;erving the ambition and efforts of genius, than tho&s;e to which it is commonly dedicated. I do not mean merely that they are &s;ubjects more friendly to virtue, but to poetry. They are more &s;ublime, novel, beautiful, agreeable, and in every way intere&s;ting.&mdash; Perhaps this experiment may not have been &s;o happily made, as to elucidate the truth of this opinion. But as it is, it is &s;ubmitted to the judgment of your readers. Should it have the happy influence to induce even one per&s;on of poetical talents, to apply tho&s;e talents to this method of ornamenting his own character, and that of his country, I &s;hall think my labours not unhappily di|rected.</Q></NOTE></HEAD>
