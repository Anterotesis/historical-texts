What? is the word <HI>Paper</HI> a scandal to them? Is a <HI>Bond</HI> or <HI>Bill-of-Exchange</HI> for 1000<HI>l,</HI> other than <HI>Paper?</HI> and yet is it not as valuable as so much Silver or Gold, supposing the Security of payment be sufficient? Now what is the <HI>Security</HI> of your Paper-mony less then the <HI>Credit of the whole Country.</HI> If the Countries <HI>Debts</HI> must be paid (as I believe they must, and <HI>I</HI> am sure in justice they ought) whatever change of Govern|ment shall come, then the <HI>Country</HI> must make good the <HI>Credit,</HI> or <HI>more Taxes</HI> must be still Raised, till the publick Debts be Answered. <HI>I</HI> say, the Country, and not the <HI>Gentlemen</HI> who <HI>Administer</HI> the Govern|ment, who are but the <HI>Countries Agents</HI> in this Affair. <HI>All the Inhabitants</HI> of the Land, taken as one Body are the <HI>Principals,</HI> who Reap the <HI>Benefits,</HI> and must bear the <HI>Bur|dens,</HI> and are the Security in their <HI>Publick Bonds.</HI> What do the Gentlemen get, but their labour for their pains, and perhaps not a little Obloquie into the bargain? can all their <HI>Estates</HI> (with all their <HI>Gains,</HI> if there were any) bear the <HI>Charge of Go|vernment</HI> for the whole Land? no, no, it cannot be supposed.

<P N="2">2. This <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>Running</HI> Cash is an <HI>abiding Cash:</HI> for no man will carry it to another Country, where it will not pass; but rather, use it here, where it will (or at least) <HI>ought:</HI> and then only the <HI>Growths of the Country</HI> will be carried off, and that will be no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> Damage but rather an Advantage to us.</P>
<P N="3">3. If this be made Currant, the <HI>Credit</HI> of the Colony will <HI>rise</HI> to the utmost height of it's ability on all Extraordinary Emergen|cies; whereas otherwise you may be quick|ly Distressed; for if the Soldiers cannot put off their Pay to Supply their necessities, who will hereafter serve the Country in their greatest Dangers, and if the Merchants can|not Buy as well as Sell for Credit, how shall they carry on their Trades? and how shall they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> end upon great occassions if the Coun|tries Bill lie dead on their hands? surely they'l no more trust the Country, whatever suddain need we should have, unless on the bare consideration of their own Security.</P>
<P>There is indeed a way found out by poor mens Necessities to make the Bills passant; namely by <HI>Selling</HI> them at <HI>Under-rates.</HI> Thus the poor <HI>Soldier</HI> is horribly <HI>injured,</HI> who have adventured their Lives in the publick Service, and the <HI>Government</HI> made <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">mptible</HI> as not worthy to be trusted. <HI>I</HI> remember many years since, there was such
<PB N="8" REF="000566_0008_0FA714A52A262170">
a prank plaid in <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Ireland</HI> after the War. Some bought up the <HI>Soldiers Debenters</HI> at very low Rates, and then with half Debenters and half Mony purchased great Estates in Kings and Bishops Lands, (a fine Trade they made of it if it had held) but God shook his Lap at this disho|nest and interloping gain; and a great unexpected Revolution made them lose both their Lands and Mony. Thus the woman shook her Dog by the Collar, till she made him Disgorge again all her Pud|dings.</P>
<P>A better way (in my opinion) to make the <HI>Credit passable</HI> without Interruption, is.</P>
<P N="1">1. To Raise the Rates of those above the <HI>common Standard,</HI> whom you catch Tardy in Debasing the Credit of your bills either by purchasing them with little mony; or sel|ling commodities for them at Excessive dearer Rates:</P>
<P N="2">2. Let all refusers to receive them have forthwith their <HI>I axes</HI> demanded in <HI>Silver,</HI> nor let them have the benefit of paying <HI>them,</HI> who will not also Receive them. And in like manner several such, as shall at any time reproach them as a <HI>Grand Cheat.</HI> Who is it but <HI>They,</HI> that makes 'em so.</P>
<P N="3">3. What if the <HI>General Court</HI> Declare by a Law, that if any man tender these Bills for payment of his Debts, to be accepted at their full value, which the Country has put upon
<PB N="9" REF="000566_0009_0FA714A624E6FDB0">
them; If any private person will not receive them so, That then the Government will not concern themselves for the recovery of those Debts, till all the <HI>Publick Debts</HI> are dis|charged. It is a known Maxim of Law in <HI>England</HI> (and <HI>I</HI> think in all other Countrys) that <HI>of Debts, The Kings must be first paid.</HI> And great reason for it; for why shall the Government secure <HI>others Debts</HI> by Law; and not <HI>their own?</HI> now if these refusers stay for their Debts till the Country be first serv'd they may stay till they are weary. And if hereafter they resolve to make no more <HI>Debts</HI> (for fear of this Law) I believe their Trading will be very dull. Whereas (on the Contrary) If they shall accept the <HI>Bills,</HI> 'tis probable their Debts will come in a pace; their Trading will revive, and the Countries Credit become Currant.</P>
<P>To Conclude [<HI>Fas est et<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ab Ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">e Doceri</HI>] The <HI>French</HI> (I hear) <HI>at Canada</HI> pass such <HI>Paper mony</HI> without the least scruple; where|by the Government is greatly Fortified, since they can at all times make what they need.

<P>These are my present thoughts, which you may communicate as you see cause; mean whole please to accept them as Really intended for the Publick good. By A well <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> to <HI>New-England</HI> &amp; your <HI>Humble Servant.</HI> &amp;c.</P>

<P N="1">1.

<P N="7">7. It is time for all people to examine, what is that which clogs the passing of our Bills. It is the debasing of them, so that <HI>twenty shillings</HI> in a <HI>Bill</HI> can scarce find <HI>Cre|dit</HI> for fourteen or fifteen shillings of <HI>stamped silver:</HI> But wherein is the Original of this? Is it in the <HI>Merchant?</HI> or the <HI>Trader?</HI> surely they who have lent the Country some Thousands of <HI>Pounds, much</HI> of it in ready silver, and <HI>all</HI> of it without Interest, or o|ther Gains (that an unthankful Neighbour hood have reported of them and reproach|ed them with) and have taken their whole Repayment in <HI>Bills of Credit,</HI> they should be willing to keep up the <HI>Credit</HI> of these Bills. Is it in the <HI>Husbandman?</HI> one would think they who find it so hard to <HI>buy Sil|ver,</HI> should be willing with their Provisi|ons to buy <HI>Credit,</HI> that may be as <HI>good</HI> (and in some cases better) to them than ready Cash. It remains then that all should joyn to mend this great error. And why may not <HI>Boston</HI> begin? where-ever were the first fault, it seems, possible now for <HI>Boston</HI> to Correct the whole. It is sup|posed the Government will be resolute in Raising what hath been granted by the Country this year, for the <HI>Publick Rates.</HI> Many Proposals have been made unto the Government, for establishing the <HI>Credit</HI> of our Bills. In my opinion, they need only

to do this; Let the <HI>Publick Rates</HI> be vigo|rously Raised. These Rates will in one years time fetch back all the <HI>Bills</HI> into the Treasury, where they will be cancelled. The people will find it their Advantage then (common <HI>sense</HI> will reach them) to furnish themselves with these <HI>Bills;</HI> tho' they give <HI>ready Silver</HI> for them, they will find they thereby save a Shilling in a Pound.
