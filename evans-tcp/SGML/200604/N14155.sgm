<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE Writer of the following Dramatic Repre&s;enta|tation, imagines that no apology will be nece&s;&s;ary for it's publication: The tran&s;actions referred to, were &s;ingular and important, and de&s;erve to be known and at|tended to, by every friend to his country, throughout the United States; for whether it is believed or not, yet it is an indubitable truth, that that State or Kingdom is ap|proaching, with a rapid &s;tep, to its final di&s;&s;olution, wherein &s;uch execrable villainies are connived at, and &s;uch eminent patrioti&s;m di&s;approved of, as are di&s;played in the following pages.</P>
<P>It is expected that the Performance will be con&s;idered as a true and impartial hi&s;tory of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, and not as a work of fancy: The Writer cho&s;e this dre&s;s, as it &s;uited his in|tention of repre&s;enting things after the real life, better than any other; and the materials he was furni&s;hed with, being principally depo&s;itions given under oath, were more ea&s;ily dige&s;ted into it verbatim; and he can a&s;&s;ure the world, that from this, and other &s;ources equally certain, he obtained &s;uch a clear and po&s;itive knowledge of the whole affair, that he thinks he can &s;afely vouch for the truth and ju&s;tne&s;s of every material circum&s;tance in the portrait; and that he can, under proper advantages, bring &s;atisfactory proof for their &s;upport: He therefore claims no merit, nor demerit, further than the bare collation, and hopes to be &s;ecured from any &s;evere reflections of the critical reader, upon the language, the characters or the drama. That every inhabitant of the United States may always for the future, receive his ju&s;t de&s;erts, and occa|&s;ion no more be given, for complaints of a &s;imilar kind, is the &s;incere wi&s;h of</P>

<HEAD>PROLOGUE, To be Spoken by Mr. FRANKLY.</HEAD>
<L>TO &s;hew the vile intentions of the mind;</L>
<L>To paint the real vices of mankind;</L>
<L>To drag out crimes conceal'd in &s;hades of nigh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></L>
<L>To fetch the lurking mi&s;chief to the light;</L>
<L>To &s;hew th' effects of ev'ry baleful ill,</L>
<L>By black examples drawn with won'drous &s;kill:</L>
<L>For this, the Drama fir&s;t adorn'd the &s;tage,</L>
<L>Checking the progre&s;s of a vicious age;</L>
<L>Here &s;ee, our crimes and follies, all portray'd,</L>
<L>The road to virtue, joy, and bli&s;s di&s;play'd&punc;</L>
<L>This, proves the wi&s;dom of the heav'nly plan;</L>
<L>That, the perver&s;ene&s;s in the heart of man:</L>
<L>But here our author far exceeds the re&s;t,</L>
<L>He dwelt unnoticed in the villian's brea&s;t,</L>
<L>There &s;aw how trea&s;on from th' infernal &s;eed,</L>
<L>Sprung forth, increas'd, and ripen'd for the deed;</L>
<L>While Satan, pouring in th' invenom'd gall,</L>
<L>Conducted, guided, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted all.</L>
<L>Far di&s;tant &s;ince, before the world began,</L>
<L>Or ever being claim'd a kindred Man,</L>
<L>Within the ble&s;t abodes of heaven above,</L>
<L>Th' empyreal regions of eternal love;</L>
<L>Satan, that fir&s;t old vile arch traitor, fell,</L>
<L>And drew with him his Myriads to rebel:</L>
<L>The great Supreme, in vengeance, quick prepar'd,</L>
<L>A fi'ry pri&s;on;&mdash;trea&s;on's ju&s;t reward:</L>
<L>And thunders rolling from th' Almighty's throne,</L>
<L>To hell's dark centre, drove the traitors down:</L>
<L>So Judas too, when he his Lord betray'd,</L>
<L>Was &s;ent to his own place, by Ju&s;tice made;</L>
<L>There, join'd by kindred &s;ouls, with &s;im'lar guilt,</L>
<L>Feel weighty vengeance for the blood they've &s;pilt.</L>
<L>Thus Heav'n and Earth were freed, the traitors now,</L>
<L>Were all impri&s;on'd in the &s;hades below,</L>
<L>No more to vex the realms of joy and peace,</L>
<L>With war, &s;edition, &s;laughter, and di&s;tre&s;s.</L>
<L>But &s;ee and wonder, that our happy Land,</L>
<L>Where freedom arms a patriotic band.</L>
<L><PB REF="017918_0005_0FA37B9342DE67D0">Where mild and equal Laws, by wi&s;dom giv'n,</L>
<L>Form a mo&s;t fair epitome of Heav'n;</L>
<L>Should be defac'd by trea&s;on's noxious breath;</L>
<L>Should, in it's bo&s;om, keep and cheri&s;h death,</L>
<L>Tran&s;gre&s;s the fir&s;t great Law; make nature groan;</L>
<L>And rob Newgate, and Satan, of their own.</L>

<HEAD>EPILOGUE, To be Spoken by Mrs. <HI>GIBBER.</HI></HEAD>
<L>I'VE often heard it repre&s;ented,</L>
<L>That women cannot be contented,</L>
<L>Unle&s;s at liberty to gabble,</L>
<L>And imitate a Yankee rabble;</L>
<L>Or the mix'd rumbling of a mill;</L>
<L>Or waggons clatt'ring down a hill:</L>
<L>In &s;uch wild var'egated clamours,</L>
<L>There's much of &s;candal, much of amours.</L>
<L>With much of non&s;en&s;e, and defaming,</L>
<L>And much not worth, nor fit the naming;</L>
<L>And to keep up the noi&s;y clatter,</L>
<L>We're often forc'd, for want of matter,</L>
<L>Our greate&s;t &s;ecrets to reveal,</L>
<L>And blab out things we &s;hould conceal,</L>
<L>Betray the cau&s;e we have e&s;pous'd,</L>
<L>And get our Hu&s;bands foundly &s;ous'd:</L>
<L>But if you've &s;een the play to night,</L>
<L>You'll &s;wear, that all was &s;aid in &s;pite,</L>
<L>And that af'rall the&s;e plaguy jokes,</L>
<L>We women &s;till are clever folks,</L>
<L>Are always wi&s;e, and good and kind,</L>
<L>No mi&s;chief dwells within our mind;</L>
<L>Think much, talk little, &s;oftly too,</L>
<L>We tell no tales, are cha&s;te and true:</L>
<L>When an event has taken place,</L>
<L>We knew it well before it was.</L>
<L>And can declare&punc; when things we &s;ee,</L>
<L>We told exactly how <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hey'd be;</L>
<L>We are, like turtle doves, mo&s;t harmle&s;s,</L>
<L>Ne'er breed confu&s;ion in our fam'lies,</L>
<L>Nor rai&s;e di&s;orders in the State,</L>
<L>Nor vent our malice, &s;pleen, or hate:</L>
<L>Shou'd you &s;uppo&s;e 'twere otherwi&s;e,</L>
<L>'Tis a deception of your eyes;</L>
<L>And if you ever find intrigues,</L>
<L>'Tis fate has plan'd them, or the Whigs:</L>
<L><PB REF="017918_0086_0FA37BD303216058">No Tory, male or female's found,</L>
<L>Ob&s;curely working under ground,</L>
<L>Or ever once his cau&s;e for&s;ook,</L>
<L>Or e'er trod back the &s;tep he'd took;</L>
<L>But Whigs, tho&s;e incon&s;i&s;tent elves,</L>
<L>Will mob us fir&s;t, and then them&s;elves;</L>
<L>Contrive deep plans to undermine us;</L>
<L>But quickly change their minds&punc; and join us;</L>
<L>Fight all the Reg'lars in <HI>New-York,</HI></L>
<L>Yet help them onward in their work;</L>
<L>Give them their money, and provi&s;ion,</L>
<L>And &s;ink the Country to perdition:</L>
<L>So if the land is overturn'd,</L>
<L>Them&s;elves all kill'd, their towns all burn'd,</L>
<L>With not a hou&s;e, or &s;oul upon it,</L>
<L>'Tis they them&s;elves, not us, have done it&punc;</L>
