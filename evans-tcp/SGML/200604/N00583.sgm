<P>H<HI>OW many ways Gods hand is out against this People, and that He hath now for a long time been managing a Contro|versy with us, in a course of awfull Afflictive Providences, is Obvious to him who is not willingly a</HI> Stranger in our Israel. <HI>We have tried many ways for the removal of our troubles, and, among others have kept many Fasts, both Publick and Private, to seek an Atonement, and obtain help from Heaven: many also, if not the most of our</HI> Churches <HI>have with Solemnity revived their</HI> Covenant <HI>Obligations to God. But that after all our Essays on this account, our dis|tresses abide on us, and our perplexities are grow|ing upon us, and God seems to blast our Enter|prizes,
<PB REF="000713_0003_0FA9ABB3FB99CC18">
to return our Prayers with anger upon us, to hide Counsel, and take away our Spirits from us; yea, &amp; expose us to the Scorn of our enemies, the Lan|guage of the Providences we are now under speaks plainly: and what may be the meaning of these things? We are by Name and Profession a People of God; and there are</HI> great Promises <HI>made to such, in case of their close walking with God: yea, and though they have Sinned, and brought troubles on themselves, if they truly</HI> Repent, <HI>and</HI> Return <HI>to Him. Doubtless if God had not been angry, we had not been thus Afflicted; and if he had not been Provoked by our Sins, He would not h&agrave;ve been an|gry; and if we had bearkned to the</HI> voice of the Rod, <HI>it would have been removed, and not continued, and harder strokes inflicted. That which God expects of us is Reformation; and though this belongs to each of us personally; and if every one would take beed to himself, and mend one, the whole would be amended: there is a common concern lying upon us, as we are a People whose interests are bound up together; so God treats us in his Providence as a community. Doubtless then it is, that it is not like to be better with us as a People, till such a</HI> Reformation <HI>be promoved; and there are the measures and steps to be taken in it, which, it is to be feared, have hi|therto been neglected.

<P><HI>The design of the following Discourse was only to shew the Necessity of this Duty, and to stimu|late all that heard it, to do what is in their Com|pass towards the furtherance of such a work. God is signifying to us, that nothing else will content Him; and He is yet</HI> in the way of His Judgments, <HI>both giving us Opportunity to attend it; and loudly calling upon us so to do: and if this word added to the other manifest speakings of our God to us, may Contribute to the awakning this People to a Serious setling about this Duty, and a vigorous pursuance of it; God shall have the Praise. It made, throngh Mercy, some Impression on the hearts of many hearers; if this Publication may be blessed to the fixing of it on such, and to the rousing of others, that we may be a truly</HI> Reforming People, <HI>and God may turn from His Anger; it will be found a</HI> Word spoken in Season; <HI>To GODS Gracious Blessing I Commend it, Who am,</HI></P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IN this Chapter, from <HI>Ver.</HI> 3. after that God had, by <HI>Moses</HI> given to the People of <HI>Israel</HI> the several Statutes and Judg|ments, where unto he required their Cordial Obedience; he declares to them the <HI>terms</HI> of the <HI>Covenant</HI> between him and them, as he afterwards did in like manner, upon the rehearsal of the Law, a little before <HI>Moses's</HI> death, <HI>Deut.</HI> 28. which is the same for substance with this, though in words diversly expressed. In it there are three parts contained. 1. A declaration of those blessings which God did engage unto their obedience, to <HI>Ver.</HI> 14. 2. A menace of such Judgments
<PB N="6" REF="000713_0006_0FA9ABB6370DCFA0">
as they should be visited withal in case of their disobedience and obstinacy: to <HI>Ver.</HI> 40. 3. A Promise made to them of mercy, and restauration, upon their repentance after all, to <HI>Vers.</HI> 46. He is more brief in the account gi|ven of the first and last of these, but com|morates more largely upon the second.</P>
<P>Before I come to a more particular dis|coursing upon this matter, it will be requisite that I remove an Objection out of the way; <ABBR><HI>Viz.</HI></ABBR> It may be, and it is said by some, that these terms here proposed are Legal, and therefore not proper to be applyed to us in Gospel times, who are under another Co|venant, and treated by God with other man|ner of dispensations towards us. To which let me briefly reply, that, though there were many and great differences in the manner of Gods dispensing of Himself to his People be|fore and after the coming of <HI>Christ</HI> in the Flesh, on the account of which diversity that is more than once called the <HI>Old Cove|nant,</HI> and this a <HI>New</HI> one; the former being suited to the Childish, the latter to the Virile Age of the Church, as the Apostle illustrates it in, <HI>Gal</HI> 4. <HI>begin.</HI> Among which this was one, that God then treated them more with <HI>Terrors,</HI> and now more with <HI>Promises;</HI> Chil|dren needing more of severity to be used with them, than such as are grown to years
<PB N="7" REF="000713_0007_0FA9ABB6F7629AA8">
of a riper understanding: whence the moral Law was revived on Mount <HI>Sinai</HI> with <HI>Thun|drings and Lightnings,</HI> and amazing terrours, which put a Consternation into the People; and <HI>Moses</HI> is usually more large in the <HI>Mina|tory</HI> than the <HI>Promissory</HI> part of the Covenant. God also then more insisted on the External Considerations of Temporary Favours and Afflictions, whereas in the Gospel such as are Spiritual are more inculcated: yet the Co|venant which God entred into with His Peo|ple then, and that which He makes with us in the days of the Gospel, is, for the sub|stance; one and the same. All the <HI>Covenants</HI> which ever God made with men, are redu|cible to one of these two, <ABBR><HI>Viz.</HI></ABBR> either the Covenant of <HI>Works,</HI> or of <HI>Grace:</HI> and it is certain, that whatsoever Transaction there hath been in a Covenant way between God and man since Adams <HI>Apostasy,</HI> is of <HI>Grace,</HI> that of <HI>Works</HI> being by the Fall, made una|ble any more <HI>to give Life</HI> unto man, <HI>Gal.</HI> 3. 21. and hence, though the <HI>Moral Law</HI> was re|newed with this People, and Solemnly pro|claimed unto them, yet <HI>it was given in the hands of a Mediatour, Gal.</HI> 3. 19. and it is to be Observed, that Gods Publick Transacti|ons with any People, considered as they are a Body, referring to Mercies and Judgments, are restrained to this Life and World. The
<PB N="8" REF="000713_0008_0FA9ABB7BA1DB750">
future Judgment of the Great Day shall not be of Communities as such, for there will then be an end of them, but every one there and then must personally answer for himself. But here there are both Temporal and Spiritual Mercies and Miseries, Blessings and Curses to be dispensed unto such accor|ding to their behaviour; we read that <HI>God|liness hath the Promise of the life that now is,</HI> 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 4. 8. and that Gods People are <HI>Judged in this World,</HI> 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 11. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">. The Judgments therefore which befell the Church in the Wil|derness, are proposed to our Consideration as Exemplary to us, and we are advised to take warning by them, that we may escape Suffer|ing the like, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 10. 11.</P>
<P>These things being thus premised, let us take a more particular view of the matter before us and here, (1.) It is supposed that a People thus circumstanced may preva|ricate; they may neglect to pay their due Obedience unto God which he requires of them, nay they may despise the Commands of God, and turn their backs upon them, <HI>Verse</HI> 14, 15. for this is the <HI>Hypothesis</HI> upon which the threatning is built; and if it were not a thing possible, and that of which there was at least some danger, the threatning would be Supervacaneous, and it is very Ob|vious that sometimes a People that make a
<PB N="9" REF="000713_0009_0FA9ABB9CE1C6570">
great pretence to Religion, will dare thus to do, and that notwithstanding the threatning stands as a thorn hedge to keep them in; they will adventure upon it, although they Scratch themselves. (2.) God threatens to bring awful Judgments upon them in case they do so Transgress, <HI>Verse</HI> 16, 17. Their Covenant Relation, and their neerness to God by reason of it, shall be no security to them against the Miseries mentioned: Sin will <HI>break down this hedge,</HI> and let the <HI>wild beasts</HI> upon them, to <HI>devour</HI> them. (3.) It is further presumed that these Judgments <HI>will not amend</HI> them, but that they will for&punc;all per|sist in their <HI>Apostasy,</HI> and proceed yet to great|er revolts: and this is supposed from one step to another, unto every one of which there is menaced a processe in the way of Judgments, and an Augmentation of their Miseries, till they come to the height: and this is mentioned four times, one whereof is in our Text, of which we may, at present make some improvement for our Instructi|on.</P>
<P>The words are very <HI>Emphatical;</HI> I might Observe the various manner of expressing this, which is used in the four several in|stances; but I shall supersede that. In our Text is contained an <HI>Hypothetical Commination,</HI> in which Observe, 1. The <HI>Hypothesis</HI> it self,
<PB N="10" REF="000713_0010_0FA9ABBA5B230D50">
<HI>Verse</HI> 23. and that is, that the Judgments which have been inflicted on them, do not <HI>Reform</HI> them; they are not reclaimed by them: <HI>i. e.</HI> they remain still obstinate, in which there are several things to be Noted. 1. It is supposed that they have before sinned a|gainst the <HI>Covenant,</HI> so as to bring the Judg|ments of God upon themselves: they are looked upon as a People under the effects of Divine displeasure for their sins. 2. It is presumed that these Judgments so brought upon them have not obtained the proper end which was expected by them; where we have the aim or end pointed at, <ABBR><HI>Viz.</HI></ABBR> <HI>to Re|form them.</HI> 3. It is looked upon to be after such time as God hath been more than once trying of them in this way, and yet it hath not taken effect, or proved successfull. The instance in our <HI>Text,</HI> is the <HI>third</HI> case mentioned, after the <HI>fist</HI> trial of all had not succeeded. 4. The nature of this Impeni|tence is expressed in the <HI>Hypothesis.</HI> 1. Nega|tively; <HI>If ye be not Reformed.</HI> 2. Positively; <HI>but walk contrary unto me.</HI> 2. Here is the Consequent threatning in case such be the event of former trials, <HI>Ver.</HI> 24. Where is pointed, 1. The manner of his carriage to|wards them, <HI>I will walk Contrary to you.</HI> 2. The aggravation of the Punishment, <HI>and will Pun|ish you yet Seven times for your Sins.</HI> I shall
<PB N="11" REF="000713_0011_0FA9ABBAB20E8788">
not here tarry to Criticise upon the words; if there be any Occasion it may be remark|ed in the Sequel. There are several great practical Truths, suitable for the present Occasion, which may be taken up from the words, and briefly improved.</P>
<P><HI>DOCT. I. The Great design of all Gods Judg|ments on a Professing People is to Reform them.</HI></P>
<P>The word signifies <HI>to bind,</HI> and <HI>Metaphori|cally to chasten,</HI> and then <HI>Metonimically,</HI> to <HI>re|form</HI> or <HI>reclaim,</HI> that being the desirable ge|nuine effect of it; and so it must be here understood. When I say this is the design, I do not speak of the end of the <HI>purpose</HI> which is secret; but of the <HI>precept</HI> which requires it, and of the Providence, which is said to bespeak it; this then is the <HI>Revealed</HI> and <HI>Pro|posed</HI> end. This may be opened and cleared in a few things.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>That Publick Calamities may be the Lot of a Professing People to meet withal.</HI> This needs no proof, in being so manifestly exemplified in the Providence of God, in all the Ages of the Church, that we may as well question the Suns shining at noon day in a clear sky. The true <HI>Emblem</HI> of the <HI>Militant Church</HI> is a <HI>Bush on fire:</HI> such a People are Obnoxious to God, to Devils, and to wicked men, and there
<PB N="12" REF="000713_0012_0FA9ABBBBA482A80">
are Occasions for their expecting to meet with trouble from them all.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>That usually they procure these Afflictions to themselves by some</HI> Apostasy. God may in|deed exercise them for the <HI>trial</HI> of their Obe|dience, and sincerity in it: Afflictions meer|ly probationary are not only suffered <HI>Perso|nally,</HI> but may be <HI>Publickly</HI> too; did not God do thus by the Kingdom of <HI>Judah</HI> un|der <HI>Hezekiah,</HI> in the time of a most zealous and through Reformation? and there is an Astonism put upon it, 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 32. <HI>begin. Af|ter these things, and the establishment thereof, &amp;c.</HI> But, though God some times, for holy ends, thus useth his Sovereignty; for the most part there hath some great Provocation or other gone before, which procured these troubles for them; and this is very agreeable to the tenour of the <HI>Covenant,</HI> in which God hath engaged to bestow his favours on a People, that walk before him in the Truth, and therefore the Apostle hath such a chal|lenge, 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 3. 13. <HI>Who is he that will harm you, if you be followers of that which is good?</HI> And God himself thus expostulates with his People, when they were suffering his Judg|ments, <HI>Jer.</HI> 2. 17. <HI>Hast thou not procured this to thy self, in that thou hast forsaken the Lord thy God?</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>That hence these Judgments are Gods Testi|mony
<PB N="13" REF="000713_0013_0FA9ABBC4C954C58">
that he beares against that sin</HI> They are the discoveries which he makes of the dis|pleasure that he takes at it; they are the <HI>To|kens</HI> of his anger by which he gives them to understand how ill he resents it that they have broken his Laws, and gone back from his Command: these therefore are, in Scrip|ture language, called his <HI>Anger,</HI> his <HI>Wrath,</HI> his <HI>Displeasure;</HI> because they are the discoveries of it. When he brings them upon men, they feel that which bespeaks him to be offended at them; they are such things as are wont in men to proceed from such a passion; and are ascribed to him after the manner of men, in whom are no passions properly so called.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>They are of the Discipline which God, by Covenant, engageth to Exercise towards his Peo|ple.</HI> It is therefore one <HI>Article</HI> mentioned in the Covenant on this <HI>Hypoth&eacute;sis, Psal.</HI> 89. 30. <HI>&amp;c. If his Children forsake my Law, &amp;c. then will I visit their transgressions with the Rod, and their iniquity with stripes.</HI> And the Apostle expres|seth it as so, <HI>Heb.</HI> 12. 6. <HI>He scourgeth every son whom be receiveth. i. e.</HI> He receiveth him on such terms. It is therefore called a <HI>Rod,</HI> which is used for <HI>Discipline,</HI> and not for <HI>Ru|ine:</HI> they are called <HI>Corrections,</HI> which, though they have anger in them, and suppose a fault which procures them, is yet tempered with love which manageth the anger for good.
<PB N="14" REF="000713_0014_0FA9ABBFB00F4C88">
And alwayes Correction is Administred for <HI>Reformation</HI> of the party that undergoes it.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>These Judgments are to be annumerated to the</HI> long-suffering <HI>which God useth towards a sinning People.</HI> This therefore is Attributed to him, and is to be read in these dispensations. As he waits before he smites them, so he waits in smiting of them, and what is this for, but to see for their amendment if it may thus be obtained? Hence that, <HI>Hos</HI> 5. 15. <HI>I will go &amp;c. in their Affliction they will seek me early.</HI> And indeed there is a great deal of Mercy in it; God corrects when he might cut off; he afflicts instead of destroying, which they deserved, and might have suffered, if he had strained the advantage offered him. This is the Churches acknowledgment, <HI>Lam.</HI> 3. 22, <HI>It is of the Lords mercy that we are not consumed.</HI> And so the good man, <HI>Neh.</HI> 9. 31. <HI>For thy great mercies sake, thou didst not utterly consume them.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>God is wont, with these Judgments, to send them invitations to Repentance, and offers of his favours if they Repent.</HI> This is a priviledg that a People in Covenant with God do en|joy, that not only doth he warn and advise them before he smites, that so, if it might be, blows might be prevented; but whiles he is smiting too: he calls upon them now to <HI>Consider their ways, Hag.</HI> 1. 5. <HI>i. e.</HI> whiles they are under afflictions. He tells them that he
<PB N="15" REF="000713_0015_0FA9ABC16BE2E8B8">
doth not thirst for their blood, or seek op|portunities to ruine them; but would have them to turn that they may prevent it, and he declares it solemnly, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 33. 11. <HI>As I live, I delight not in the Death &amp;c. Turn ye, Turn ye, why will ye Die, Oh house of Israel?</HI> And he Declares that if they do turn he will receive them, and turn his anger away from them, <HI>Jer.</HI> 3. 22. <HI>Return ye backsliding Children, and I will heal your backslidings; and so Chap.</HI> 4. 1.</P>
<P N="7">7. <HI>God hath been wont, upon their Reformati|on, to avert his Judgments from his People.</HI> This is a course that hath not used to fail. How often did he do so for his People of old! as we shall find upon Record in Scripture History: Nay such hath been the pitty which he hath extended to them in this regard, that when their Reformation hath been feigned, and not upright, yet he hath delivered them for-all, and that many a time, as is intimated in <HI>Psal.</HI> 78. 34. <HI>&amp;c.</HI> how much more then will be do so when it is hearty, and sincere? it is a very remarkable passage in, <HI>Judg.</HI> 10. 15, 16.</P>
<P N="8">8. <HI>Hence the reason why God hath at any time proceeded to Extirpate a Professing People hath been their</HI> Impenitence. When neither word nor rod, neither warnings nor Judgments would prevail with them to return, but they have re|mained obstinate under all; see an account of
<PB N="16" REF="000713_0016_0FA9ABC323B07598">
this, 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 36. 15, 16. He waited <HI>till there was no remedy;</HI> no other course to be taken: all their other Provocations, though never so many and heinous, would never have brought it to this, if they had not added contumacy to their Apostasy; hence we have God using of that Expostulation with them, <HI>Isai</HI> 48. 18, 19.</P>
<P><HI>USE. I.</HI> Learn hence, <HI>That if a Professing People perish at last, they must blame themselves.</HI> Well might God say to them as he did, <HI>Hos.</HI> 13. 9. <HI>Oh Israel! thou hast destroyed thy self.</HI> All the sore Judgments and Calamities, which God brings upon a sinning People, are not in themselves any Symptom of their ruine; are not a sure token that God hath forsaken them; though sometimes <HI>Zton,</HI> when sorely visited with them, is ready to say <HI>My God hath forgotten me;</HI> but they are on the other hand, and argument that God is loth to de|stroy them, and therefore he first tries whe|ther by such Judgments this may not be pre|vented. What the Apostle saith, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 11. 32. <HI>When we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we should not be Condemned with the Oorld;</HI> is here applicable. God by Afflicting of a sinfull People, shews that he would not destroy them, unless they themselves are re|solved <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> their own destruction. There is a <HI>Voice</HI> in the <HI>Rod,</HI> and he would have them to
<PB N="17" REF="000713_0017_0FA9ABC3B026EB68">
<HI>hear it, and him who hath appointed it, Mic.</HI> 6. 9. And he hath more than once said it, that if they will hear it shall be well with them for all: if then they will not hear, but stop their cars at this voice, and harden their hearts against the advice of it, and so they perish, where is the fault?</P>
<P><HI>USE. II. Let this then serve to point us to our present Duty.</HI> It tells us what it is that is now incumbent on us. We are a people whom God hath <HI>taken near</HI> to Himself, who have been priviledged with his Covenant fa|vours and blessings; whom he hath done many and great things for: but he hath sig|nally altered the course of his Providence to|wards us, and brought us under his rod; his hand is many ways out against us, and we are made <HI>low;</HI> he hath <HI>wasted us by smiting us</HI> many ways, and we are reduced to great distresses. And what is all this for but our iniquities? if we had not revolted from him, he would not have thus Afflicted us: our peace, and our prosperity might have continu|ed uninterrupted, and he would have delight|ed in it. What then remains, but that we set upon a real and a through <HI>Reformation?</HI> And let us be serious in it. Are there not the things among us that need Reforming? Is there not a fearful decay of love, and zeal,
<PB N="18" REF="000713_0018_0FA9ABC4809356C0">
and holiness among us? is not almost every thing that can be thought of out of order a|mongst us? and is our God now manifesting of the dislike that he takes at it. What have we to do then, but to set upon this work in good earnest? Let all orders of men be invited to it. Let us all <HI>Search, and try, and Turn, Lam.</HI> 3.40. And to move us, Con|sider,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>God is waiting to be gracious.</HI> Whatever displays he gives us of his righteous anger, and they are awfull, yet still he is to be <HI>Sought in the way of his Judgments, Isa.</HI> 26. 8. though he be scourging of us by his Afflictive Providences, yet he is still <HI>hearkening to hear</HI> if there be any inclination in us this way; if there be the least motions or stirrings in our hearts towards it; and he will take it well of us if there be; he therefore makes that complaint on this account; <HI>Jer.</HI> 8. 6. <HI>I hearkned and heard, but none spake aright, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Hence, if we do Reform, there is hope:</HI> May not we say as he did <HI>Ezra,</HI> 10. 2, 3. <HI>We have trespassed against our God, yet now there is hope in Israel concerning this thing, now therefore let us make a Covenant with our God.</HI> And observe what great incouragment there is gi|ven for our so doing, <HI>Joel</HI> 2. 12. <HI>&amp;c.</HI> God is merciful and gracious, and ready to <HI>Repent of the evil,</HI> and he hath his end in smiting of us,
<PB N="19" REF="000713_0019_0FA9ABC53336F258">
if this may but be obtained, the design of Corrective Providences is fully answered, and so the controvesy is ended when once it ar|rives at this. <HI>Why then do we sit still?</HI> Why <HI>do we pine away in our iniquities,</HI> because we do not put them away from us? let us be up and doing, and the Lord will accept of us.</P>
<P><HI>DOCT. II. A declined Professing People, may meet with sore Judgments, and yet remain unreformed under and after them.</HI></P>
<P>This is supposed and presumed in our Text, and remember, it is the fourth step in the Process of Gods judicial dispensation towards them; and we are not to think such things are here supposed which may not be. We shall therefore find awfull instances of this truth upon record in the word of God, giving us to understand that it hath been so <HI>in Thesi.</HI> What great pains did God afterwards take with this People for their <HI>Reformation,</HI> when they had forgotten the works that he had done in <HI>Egypt,</HI> and in the Wilderness, and were revolted from him? and yet what was the issue of all? although <HI>He sent all his ser|vants the Prophets to them, rising up early and sending them,</HI> by whom he laid evident Con|victions of their sins, before them, gave them awfull warnings of his Judgments impending,
<PB N="20" REF="000713_0020_0FA9ABC5F9DE4520">
and urged upon them solemn and serious in|vitations to repent, with the fairest promises of his favour in case of their compliance therewithall: and though he laid many and severe stroaks upon them, bringing of them low for their iniquities, wasting them every way; yet to what purpose was it? what effect did it work in them? We are told, that God <HI>would have purged them, but they were not purged;</HI> this is the complaint that is made against them in <HI>Ezek.</HI> 24. 13. They <HI>held fast their deceit, and would</HI> not let it goe, <HI>Jer.</HI> 8.5.8. so it went on; nor is this at all to be wondered at, if we shall Consider;</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>The body of a Professing People are not al|ways truly gracious.</HI> To be sure, in times wherein there is a decay of holiness, and in|crease of impiety, it is not like to be so. All are not Israel that are of Israel. There is in|deed a bored ear in the Children of God, that doth encline them to be ready to heark|en to the voice of the Rod, and to be awaken|ed to discipline; to be of a tender&punc; heart, and resent the displeasure of God; this is the na|tural and genuine working of Grace in the heart wherein it really planted. But all are not so who are the People of God by exter|ternal denomination, and a verbal profession. When <HI>Apostasy</HI> begings to creep upon a Peo|ple, Conversion work begins to be more rare,
<PB N="21" REF="000713_0021_0FA9ACEDC131E0B0">
and men are not so frequently brought home to God by a through and saving change wrought in them: <HI>Hypocrisy</HI> and <HI>Luke warm|ness</HI> begins to get head and prevail, and the power of Godliness ceaseth, and men rest contented in <HI>a name to live whiles they are dead.</HI> We have the Character of such a Church fully represented to us in that of <HI>Laodicea,</HI> in <HI>Rev.</HI> 3. 14. <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And it is not seldom exempli|fied in the world, where the name of Christ is taken up.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Gods own Children are sometimes judicially left under obstinate frames.</HI> It is the mourn|full expostulation of the Church, <HI>Isa.</HI> 63. 17. <HI>O Lord, why hast thou made us to erre from thy wayes, and hardned our hearts from thy fear?</HI> And though there be a Principle of saying grace in them, which enclines them to an holy fear; yet they have a body of death too, which hath it influence on them, and that so powerfull, that they are drawn by it into the sins of the times and places they live in, and God is displeased at them for it, and so he awfully leaves them to have their ears stopt, so as not to give ear, as they ought to do, to the warnings he gives, and the Judg|ments which he inflicts. We have instances for this in <HI>Eli, David, Asa,</HI> serving to let us understand, how far holy men may, under desertion provoke their Father to displeasure,
<PB N="22" REF="000713_0022_0FA9ACEE4753DEA8">
and thereby open away for more temporal Judgments to come upon them.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Natural men have no true liking to the ways of God.</HI> They are in their sins, and so their hearts are set for sin. Lust hath Domi|nion in them, and all the powers of their Souls are engaged for it; their understanding approves it, <HI>calls evil good;</HI> their wills give it the preference, and so makes choice of it, and their affections are set upon it. Hereup|on, their close keeping to Duty, and their ab|stinence from sin is a forced thing, and a|gainst the whole bent of their natures; it is a yoke that doth not sit easy on their necks, but feels very irksome to them: and this makes them in a readiness to shake it off, and glad of an opportunity so to do; and such opportunities, the times of declension afford enough of to them: when many sins grow common, and not so scandalous, and witness begins not to be born against them as some|times, now the before hidden corruption looks forth and shews its head: and when once they are gotten into such a way, they are willing to <HI>hold it fast,</HI> and care not for being disturbed in it, or turning away from it: hence that complaint, <HI>Jer.</HI> 5. 23. <HI>This People hath a revolting and rebellious heart, they are revolted and gone.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Afflictions, or Judgments, have not in them|selves
<PB N="23" REF="000713_0023_0FA9ACEF586014F0">
the vertue of Reforming a backslidden Peo|ple.</HI> They are indeed made use of by God for this purpose, and if he pleaseth to influ|ence them they shall be servicable to the fur|therance of it, and suitable <HI>moral</HI> arguments may be drawn from them for conviction and awakning; but they cannot alone work any gracious effect: except <HI>Correction</HI> and <HI>Instructi|on</HI> go together, there is no good like to be done. Hence that, <HI>Psal.</HI> 94. 12. <HI>Blessed is the man whom thou chastenest, O Lord, and teachest him out of thy Law,</HI> otherwise, <HI>Bray a fool in a morter among wheat with a Pestil, yet will not his foolishness depart from him. Prov.</HI> 27. 22. Men might indeed know, if they would, what Afflictions come for, and that would be a step to Reformation, if there were a through Conviction upon the Conscience; but there is no kindly working upon the heart by this alone. Unsanctified Afflictions, being mis|improved by the native corruption that is in man, will make him worse, and more obsti|nate, instead of mending him; 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 28. 22. <HI>And in the time of his distress he did yet trespass more against the Lord.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>Sinfull men are hard to be perswaded to believe that they are the guilty causes of the Judg|ments that are upon Gods People.</HI> Men indeed are apt at such times to make a fearfull cry against sin, talk much of the Provocation that is given
<PB N="24" REF="000713_0024_0FA9ACF1C89B3B58">
to God, as if they had a mind to find it out and have it removed: but yet every one is apt to put it off from himself and lay it upon others. There is a great deal of noise made at such a time, but what is there in it? If we observe we shall find, that it is only throw|ing dirt one upon another; but as for them|selves, they are clear and innocent; they have nothing to accuse themselves of; if others would have been as carefull as they, this might have been avoided. How doth God make such a complaint as this? <HI>Jer.</HI> 8. 6. <HI>I heark|ned and heard, but they spake not aright: no man repented him of his wickedness, saying what have I done?</HI> There is such a sottishness in men, that they cannot think their ways are perverse, they can see no evil in them, so are they charged, <HI>Isa.</HI> 44. 20. <HI>A deceived heart hath turned him aside, that he cannot deliver his own soul, not say, is there not a lie in my right hand?</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>Hence, till God powers out his Spirit upon them, men do remain thus stupid and senseless.</HI> There must be an inward working upon the hearts of men by the Spirit of God, if ever they are by his Judgments wrought up to Re|formation. Till he gives them eyes to see, and hearts to consider, they continue as sot|tish as ever. Let one Judgment come upon them in the neck of another, let them be broken, wasted, consumed, and almost laid
<PB N="25" REF="000713_0025_0FA9ACF355E744F0">
desolate, and they are obdurate still; all this will not melt down their hard hearts, or bring them to any kindly complyance with God. It is an observation made by the Prophet, <HI>Isa.</HI> 42. 25. <HI>Therefore he hath poured upon him the fury of his anger, and the strength of battel: and it hath set him on fire round about, yet he knew it not; and it burned him, yet he laid it not to heart.</HI></P>
<P><HI>USE. I.</HI> Learn hence, <HI>That Judgments a|lone, are not a sure sign that God hath a purpose of good for such a People as suffer by them.</HI> It is true, they do bear witness for God, that he is very loth to destroy them, if it might in a|ny other way be prevented; they say that he is a God of great patience, and that he is waiting for the repentance of such a People, that so he may yet be favorable to them and establish them; else he could as easily have cut them off at a stroak and must have been justified in his doing so. But still, we can make no certain Judgment of the issue, till we see what influence and efficacy these Judg|ments have upon them; the conclusion is still suspended. If once they appear to work kindly, and begin to awaken them to enquire into the provocation, and seriously to set about the work of Reformation, there is then a good hope offered us, that all will end well at last.
<PB N="26" REF="000713_0026_0FA9ACF45B43B898">
But if still they do not reform; nay, if rei|terated Judgments do not produce such an effect as this is on them, but they still persist in their evil wayes, and are rather hardned in them by these Afflictions, there is abundant reason given us to be very doubtfull what it will come to at the last.</P>
<P><HI>USE.</HI> II. <HI>Let it then put us upon the enquiry, What effect all the stroaks of God which we have felt, have wrought on us.</HI> And it is of no small consequence that we do in good earnest make this enquiry, as will more evidently ap|pear in the following Observations. That we have been under the discipline of Gods Judgments is not to be called in questi|on; let us then see to it what is the fruit of all upon us; we are here given to understand that all so treated are <HI>not reformed;</HI> and it is not every thing that looks fair, which will amount to the <HI>Reformation</HI> which God expects. It is not crying out of sin in general, nor cal|ling of Solemn Assemblies, Fasting, Praying, Confessing, Petitioning, renewing of Cove|nants, making of Laws, putting away of some more gross and enormous sins that are appa|rently provoking, that will answer Gods ex|pectation, and so put a stop to his anger, and turn away his Judgments from us. It is ano|ther manner of thing to <HI>Reform.</HI> Let us then
<PB N="27" REF="000713_0027_0FA9ACF5106BD798">
be very inquisitive into his matter, and make a diligent search about it. If we think that we have done it, or are in the way to the doing of it, when there is no such thing, we shall miserably deceive our selves; and it will be no little damage that will arise to us from it. And one would think that a small enquiry upon this account, would be suffici|ent both to convince and condemn us: there hath been so much of notorious flightiness and neglect in this regard, that it is hard to say what one thing hath been amended: and if we shall call all that we have hitherto been doing, a <HI>Reformation?</HI> will not God upbraid|ingly say to us, <HI>Is this the Reformation, that I have required?</HI> is this the thing that you have made so much of a talk and doe about? is this all that you intend?</P>
<P><HI>DOCT.</HI> III. <HI>If Gods Judgments do not reform a backslidden People, the blame lies in their wilfulness.</HI></P>
<P>Hither the Lord chargeth it, not if you do not, but if ye will not reform. All the <HI>impenitency</HI> of a backslidden People is the effect of their <HI>obstinacy.</HI> This is not to be under|stood so, as if they did not labour of <HI>Impotency</HI> in themselves, or as if they had a power in themselves to reform themselves, which is the mistaken inference which some draw from
<PB N="28" REF="000713_0028_0FA9ACF5D12FB820">
such Scriptures as charge sin upon mans wil|fulness. No, it must be granted that they cannot reform themselves; although it is al|so certain that externally, or with respect to practice, they might do a great deal more than they doe; and that will manifestly de|clare them <HI>inexcusable:</HI> but truly to turn from sin, and cordially to return to God from whom they have departed, is a work above their ability, and the Spirit of God must pow|erfully work it in them, if ever it be done. But still God is wont to lay the blame of their not being <HI>Reformed,</HI> not upon their im|potency, but their wilfulness. Thus <HI>Matth.</HI> 23. 37. <HI>How often would I have gathered thy Children, but ye would not. Joh.</HI> 5. 40. <HI>Ye well not come unto me;</HI> and here lies the height of the wickedness of it; and that it is so, will be made to appear, if we consider these three things.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>That a principal part of the natural im|potency of men, lies in the</HI> pravity <HI>of their</HI> wills. It is true, mans whole nature and all the faculties in him are dehilitated, sin having a rooting in them all, and robbed them of the <HI>Image</HI> of God, by which once man was fitted with ability for his work; but as the will is the leading faculty in the man, so is the im|potency of it very notorious. That sin which men are full of, hath laid fast hold on
<PB N="29" REF="000713_0029_0FA9ACF670800400">
them, and engaged their hearts to it, and they have made choise of it, and that according to the dictates of a depraved understanding: for that being filled with crooked <HI>principles,</HI> causing it to judge perversly of things, and quite contrary to what they are in reality, hath drawn away the will after it, into a spon|teneous and deliberate Election and Embrace|ment of these delusions; and by their will it is that men <HI>hold fast deceit, Jer.</HI> 8. 5. Their sins have thus gained not only their <HI>Approbation,</HI> to preferre them before holiness, but also their <HI>Affections;</HI> they love the ways of iniqui|ty, and that makes them to adhere to them; <HI>Jer.</HI> 2. 25. <HI>I have loved strangers, and after them I will goe.</HI> And hereby their wills are be|come so impotent, that they cannot make a better choise of themselves, or by their own power: and yet all this is <HI>voluntary;</HI> there is no outward force laid upon them to cause them thus to do, but it is a fruit of the native Corruption which is in them.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>That men do wilfully shut their eyes against the Convictions wich are laid before them, by which they might be led to</HI> Reformation. The Afflictions themselves which they suffer, are for <HI>Conviction;</HI> there is such a design in them, God sends them for sin, and they are to <HI>bring it to remembrance;</HI> they have a <HI>Voice</HI> in them, and it is intelligible; they say that God is
<PB N="30" REF="000713_0030_0FA9ACF91EE47E38">
angry with such a People, and they serve to put men upon enquiry after the cause of them; even the <HI>Philistines</HI> themselves are led by the light of nature to ask such a question when the hand of God is upon them, acknowledg|ing that it was from him, and thereupon to consult how they might obtain a removal of it, 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 6. <HI>begin.</HI> Yea, and many times the Judgments bring light in and with them, to discover the ground of the controversy, and point to the very sin against which they are witnesses. <HI>Adonibezek</HI> was thus brought to a Confession of his cruelty, and Gods just vin|dication, <HI>Judg.</HI> 1. 7. But besides this, when God comes to punish a People that are in Covenant with him, he is wont, together with these troubles, to send them matter of Conviction in his <HI>Ordinances,</HI> to awaken his Servants in the Ministry, to touch their hearts, and suggest to them the things that he con|tends for, and make them to <HI>Cry aloud and not to spare,</HI> but to <HI>shew his People the sins</HI> they are guilty of; and to do it with all evidence and demonstration; so that if men would but listen and give ear to these cryes and Con|victions, they might be throughly convinced and not be able to withstand. But the reason why they do not thus do, is because <HI>they will not.</HI> What they said plumply to the Prophet, <HI>Jer.</HI> 44. 16. <HI>As for the word that thou hast spoken
<PB N="31" REF="000713_0031_0FA9ACFAB8BD44C0">
to us in the name of the Lord, we will not heark|en unto thee.</HI> These say the same practically, which amounts to as much in the event, and is so interpreted by God as if their tongues had uttered it: and this is to be charged on all that do not take the warnings, and bring themselves to the light of the truth, that they may know their sins. And what is the reason why they will not readily receive the light, but shut their eyes against it, and do what in them lies to keep it out? it is because they are resolved to hold on their sinfull courses, and would be quiet in it; which that they may, they would prevent the reflexions of <HI>Conscience,</HI> which is most likely be done by keeping them in the <HI>dark;</HI> our Saviour tells us how it is, and why it is so in this regard, <HI>Joh.</HI> 3.19, 20. <HI>Mens ways</HI> are evil, and they are afraid to know that they are so, and to be <HI>reproved</HI> for them; they therefore resolve to resist all the means that might bring them to a knowledge of themselves and their evil doings.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>That men will not receive the help which otherwise they might have, to remove all the o|ther impediments of their</HI> Reformation. It is true, none can turn themselves, till God put in his Grace and turn them, he must first draw us, before we can run after him: it was a right Prayer which <HI>Ephraim</HI> put up, <HI>Jer.</HI> 31.
<PB N="32" REF="000713_0032_0FA9ACFB6428CE30">
18. <HI>Turn thou me, and I shall be turned.</HI> But God, in his Ordinances, offers to his People, together with reproofs, all the Assistance and Grace that is wanting to the doing of that which he requires of them: he useth all means and endeavours with them, tendring them his hand, but they reject him, they <HI>will have none of him,</HI> they had rather go without his help; they are not willing to be rid of their sins: they are therefore said to <HI>resist his Spirit;</HI> and hereupon, the reason rendred why God at length <HI>leaves them up</HI> to their sinfull wayes, and gives them over to their vile courses to sin without any restraints, is because they would not accept of these his gracious offers, <HI>Psal.</HI> 81. 11, 12. <HI>My People would not hearken to my voice, &amp;c. So I gave them up to their own hearts lust; &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P><HI>USE.</HI> I. Learn hence, <HI>How inexcusable we shall be, if under all Gods Judgments we</HI> Reform <HI>not.</HI> Men are ready to think they have a great deal to plead for themselves by way of excuse: alas! if God do not give them Grace to repent and reform, how should they ever do it? They have no power of themselves, and if they should attempt it, what would it turn to? If therefore they ly in their sins, and <HI>pine away in their iniquities,</HI> how can they help it? This seems to be the meaning of their
<PB N="33" REF="000713_0033_0FA9ACFBC064DC50">
Language in, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 33. 10. But this will not stand men in any stead. If indeed men had a heart to it, and eages desire after it; if they were really for it, and used cordial endeavours after it; if they did truly bewail this impotency of theirs, and cry out importunately and heartily to God for his help against it, as those that were weary of their sins, and would fain be rid of them, and God should refuse them his Grace, and with hold this necessary help from them, somthing then were to be pleaded: But when was it ever so? When did God with|hold his Grace from such as did indeed desire it, and ask for it? He hath promised, and al|wayes practised the contrary. No, no, the will is in it, we are set against it, we have chosen our own ways, they best please us, we cannot part with them; God calls us once and again, and he smites us at one time and ano|ther, and we stop our cars at him, turn our backs upon him, shut our eyes, and harden our hearts. And what can such a people say for themselves, against whom it will be proved that they were wilfully set in their own way, in despite of all courses used to reclaim them. Whoever excused such as wilfully transgressed&punc; this is that which all mans reason accounts a Consideration that takes away all excuse.</P>

<PB N="34" REF="000713_0034_0FA9ACFC7985EBF0">
humble us in this regard, and doubtless we have great Occasion for it.</HI> Hath not God been using all manner of endeavours with us, to bring us to a sight and sence of our sins, and to make us know that it is an evil and a bitter thing that we have forsaken him to such a degree as we have, and that feelingly by the sense of all those sharp stroaks that he hath laid upon us; and there have been many of them, and no little of his severity exercised in them: and hath he not the mean while been send|ing as many faithful warnings, cleer Convic|tions, and awakning loud calls in his House and Ordinances, and that from time to time? Have not <HI>all his Servants</HI> been unanimously engaged in this design? Hath there been any thing wanting as to means? <HI>What more could he have done, than what he hath done?</HI> Nay have we not been convinced in our Con|sciences, and enforced by them to make Con|fessions upon this account? Hath he not also kindly invited us to lay hold on his strength, and be at peace with him? offering us all fair terms in the treaty he hath been holding all this while with us? What is the reason then that there is no more <HI>Reformation</HI> wrought in the midst of us? Have we been willing, and God unwilling? He will certainly make us to know that there is no such matter ere he hath done with us. How then should this confound
<PB N="35" REF="000713_0035_0FA9ACFD54E6D868">
us, and lay us in the dust before him? How should it fill us with shame, and cloath us in sackcloth? Let us then see and confess the naughtiness of our own hearts; and take the blame home to our selves; set us acknowledge as <HI>Ephraim, Jer.</HI> 31. 18. <HI>We have been as a bul|lock unaccustomed to the yoak.</HI> This is the great complaint which we have at this day to make of our selves before God, and bitterly to be|wail it in his presence, that <HI>we have hardned our hearts against him;</HI> that we have obstinate|ly-set our selves to withstand all the attemps which he hath been using to reclaim us. And let us <HI>be no more stiff necked,</HI> but bring these hard hearts of ours to him to have them made tender, and beg of him to take the stone out of them, and work them to a true compliance with his will; that we may have a true re|sentment of all his Judgments and be humbled under them: and if this may be obtained, we are in fair way to be reformed; and then there will be a good hope that he will return and save us. And what a happy day would this prove for us, if it might come to this issue?</P>
<P><HI>DOCT.</HI> IV. <HI>An unreformed Professing People do all the while walk contrary to God.</HI></P>
<P>Thus he interprets it, <HI>Text.</HI> This is the very sense that he puts upon it; in the <HI>Hebrew</HI> it is,
<PB N="36" REF="000713_0036_0FA9AD035A24A468">
<HI>shall walk with me contrarily.</HI> And the man|ner of expression seems to have something observable in it, nothing, a pretence of being his people, and making it their design to walk with him, <HI>i. e.</HI> in conformity to his commands; and yet a carrying of it <HI>contrary,</HI> to the pre|tence of their practice. And the phrase notes an Opposition, or a setting of themselves a|gainst God. And that such a people as do not, will not reform, do thus, will appear on the Consideration of these things.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>All Apostasy is a revolting from God.</HI> A People that are in Covenant with him, have acknowledged and submitted to his Sovereign|ty over them; they have owned him to be their <HI>Lord,</HI> and their <HI>King,</HI> and their <HI>Law-givers</HI> and bound themselves to yield obedience to all his commands; promised that <HI>all that the Lord shall speak unto them, they will do it.</HI> Now God hath given them his Orders, according to which he expects that they should regulate themselves, and therein give a Testimony of their loyalty to him: Every professing people are <HI>brought under this bond of the Covenant</HI> When therefore they depart from his obedience, and <HI>turn aside to their crooked wayes,</HI> they therein depart from their Allegiance. Hence it is called a <HI>revolting, Jer.</HI> 5. 23. <HI>They are revolted, &amp; gone:</HI> and the name of <HI>revolters</HI> is put upon them, <HI>Chap.</HI> 6. 28. <HI>They are all grievous <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span">.</HI>

Every new act of disobe|dience to his Commands, is a renewed actual opposing of themselves unto him; and by e|very such act they do as much as say, that they are resolved to withstand him. The life of man is compared to a <HI>walk,</HI> and every action that is done in it, is a <HI>step</HI> in that walk; and so long as they are out of the right way, and still going, they do but increase their revolt. Every sinner is a <HI>Rebel;</HI> he that persists in his sin, is an <HI>hardned rebel;</HI> and this must needs be a wofull contrariety to God. God is then only complied with when men do repent of their sins; for that is it which he requires of them; wilfull impenitence then is a setting of themselves to oppose this will of his; and what can be more contrary than this?</P>

<P>Thus therefore he expresseth the nature of the Judgments which he brings on them for their wilfull impenitence, and by this manner of expression he vindicates the righteousness of his proceedings against them in the way of Judgment, it is nothing else but a <HI>Retalation;</HI> he doth but pay them in their own kind; and what can be more equal? for, if they set themselves against him, it is but just that he should be against them; if they are the ag|gressours, it is fit he vindicate himself, by with|standing of them.

For,</P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>Herein he accomplisheth the Covenat threat|ning.</HI> If we look upon the Covenant of God as it is plighted between him and the body of a people professing to be his, it is very evident, that there do not only belong to it gracious promises made to their faithfull Obedience unto him, but also awfull threatnings against all disobedience; and to these threatnings do belong all the Afflictions that are denounced in the word of God against the disobedience of a people that stand so related to him. There are some indeed who do call these the promi|ses of the Covenant; but it is very <HI>Catachres|tically,</HI> if not a plain <HI>Antiphrasis:</HI> for a promise always hath a respect to something that is good; whereas these things are in their own nature evil, and so the Scripture calls them, which is the proper matter of a threatning; hence that, <HI>Jer.</HI> 11. 17. <HI>The Lord of hosts that
<PB N="45" REF="000713_0045_0FA9AD0CF3D4F778">
planted thee, hath pronounced evil against thee.</HI>And although sometimes eventually they prove for good, and that according to Gods purpose; and on this account, those that are compared to <HI>good Figs,</HI> are said to be <HI>sent to Babilon for their good, Jer.</HI> 24. 5. Yet this is besides the na|ture of them. Gods Children therefore are wont to be <HI>afraid of those Judgments, Psa.</HI> 119. 120. And God doth therefore speaks of them, that he may stirre up this fear, to make them cautious against exposing of themselves to them.</P>
<P N="2">2. Hence,<HI>By them God is said to do men hurt.</HI> So he expresseth it, <HI>Josh.</HI> 24. 20. <HI>Then will he turn and do you hurt, and consume you, after that he hath done you good.</HI> They are many ways harmfull to a people that are brought under the impres|sions of them: besides the misery that men do personally suffer by them, in which some are usually more deeply concerned than others, being made the peculiar monuments of the severity of such Judgments; there is great evil which befalls the body of such a people. They are greatly hurt by Famines, by Pestilences, by Sword, by Captivity and bondage, their glory is disgraced by such disasters, their numbers are wasted, and they are made, of a great ma|ny, to be but a few; their comforts of life are taken away from them, and they are brought into miserable distress; they are filled with sorrows and bitter mournings; and they are
<PB N="46" REF="000713_0046_0FA9AD0DB39F4560">
wasted, impoverished, and brought low by them, and made <HI>to come down &amp; sit in the dust solitary; they are made a reproach to their enemies, a scoff and a scorn to all those that hate them,</HI> who point at them and say, <HI>This is Zion the out-cast, &amp;c.</HI> And all this doth very sensibly hurt them; and that which doth a man hurt, must needs be contrary to him.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>These are all of them the effects and discove|ries of Gods anger: and that is certainly against them. Anger</HI> is one of the separating affections, and it makes a distance between him that is angry, and those at whom he is so. It is true, if there be love in the bottom of these Afflictions, (and many times there is so, for he hath said, <HI>Rev.</HI> 3. 19. <HI>As many as I love, I rebuke &amp; chasten;</HI> and there is a consistency between love and anger; a father may be angry with his offend|ing son, and beat him in anger, but love go|verns that wrath) then all this is for them in the secret counsel of God. But the anger is certain, the course of providence bears witness to that; whereas there is not a present discovery of the love which is at work in the manage|ment of it: and besides, this love is usually re|served but for a <HI>Remnant,</HI> for whom God hath <HI>thoughts of peace, and to put a good end</HI> to their Afflictions; whereas others are exposed to his <HI>force indignation.</HI> But when God brings these evils upon men, he is said to <HI>make away for his

And how do we find in Scrip|ture, the History of such dispensations intro|duced with that preface, <ABBR><HI>Viz.</HI></ABBR> <HI>That the anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel,</HI> and therefore he did so and so: and this tells us that God herein walks contrary to them.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>And it is directly contrary to mens desire &amp; hopes.</HI> As sin is opposite to Gods <HI>Hiliness,</HI> and it <HI>grievs</HI> him, so is sorrow to mens <HI>Inclinations,</HI> and it <HI>vexeth</HI> them.

That therefore which is contrary to this, that undermines their peace and health, and destroys their prosperity and liberty, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> is that which they hate, and it perplexeth them: and hence, when God by his providence thus deals with

It is high time then for us to bethink our selves, and be in good earnest too, and trifle no longer with him. It was indeed high presumption in us to dare him to this at first; and to stout it out so long against his warnings with which he sought to reclaim us&punc; that a further proceeding against us might so have been prevented: but it will be madness to a <HI>Paroxism</HI> for us to continue in it, when we see him up in arms, and causing the arrows of his vengeance to fly among us, and he is <HI>Marching through our land in his fury.</HI> It is high time then for us to enter into seri|ous Consultation&punc; whether there be no way to be found in which an end may be put to such a Controversy, and without delay to get into the way&punc; for, if he sets himself against us, woe unto us, we can never stand before him.

<P><HI>DOCT.</HI> VI. <HI>There is a certain gradation in the Judgments of God upon an Apostatizing People.</HI></P>
<P>God here speaks of <HI>Punishing them,</HI> or <HI>smit|ting of them</HI> (for so the word used in our Text firstly signifies) <HI>Seven times more, i. e.</HI> by a seven fold greater and more terrible smit|ing than that which was before, and he men|tions this many times over in the Context, in every of which he still riseth by Sevens. <HI>Se|ven</HI> is not here to be taken strictly, but for <HI>many,</HI>or <HI>much greater; </HI>and yet, it being a num|ber of perfection, it denotes a very notable and observable Augmentation of the Calami|ties threatned, in the progress of Gods judici|al dispensations, when he passeth over from one scene of Judgments to another, and with|all it points us to the gradual progress which he is pleased to make with men this way, and this gives us the advantage to take notice of the wonted dealings of God with a people in
<PB N="51" REF="000713_0051_0FA9AD156410D960">
Covenant with him, different from what is usually towards those that are strangers to him&punc; or towards particular persons. And there are four things that we may here take notice of; only remembering, that God useth much of his <HI>Sovereignty</HI> in the diversifying of his dispensa|tions on this account; as to circumstances; though for the substance this is the ordinary course.</P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>He is wont first to give them warning before he smites them.</HI> These Judgments come for sin, and that according to the threatning. But God being mercifull, and pitiful, doth not fall upon them presently upon every prevari|cation of their; but, though they give him provocation, he will first offer them admoni|tion; tells them what they have done, how they have exposed themselves by it; tells them he is loth to smite them if they will be reclaim|ed on easier terms, and accordingly invites them to it: and these warnings are first more gen|tle, and afterwards more severe; and that is when he not only cautions, but withall threat|ens them in case they will not presently com|ply with them: and the reason of all this is, because, if they will by any fair means, or hard words&punc; be reclaimed, there may be a stop, and the threatnings not take place upon them. The reason therefore why he doth proceed to
<PB N="52" REF="000713_0052_0FA9AD18AEFBBD90">
smite them, is rendred to be because they did not take these warnings; what doth God him|self say, <HI>Zeph.</HI> 37. <HI>I said, surely thou wilt fear me, thou wilt receive instruction.</HI> And see how God interprets his own threatnings, <HI>Jer.</HI> 18.7, 8. <HI>At what time I speak concerning a nation, to pluck up, and pull down and destroy; if that nation turn from their evil, I will repent of the evil that I thought to do to them: </HI>Repentance is here as|cribed to him after the manner of men; the meaning is, I will not do it. He limits the threatning to this <HI>Hypothesis.</HI> God hath that respect for his people, that if <HI>Chiding</HI> will do, he will not <HI>Smite; </HI>if <HI>Words</HI> will prevail, he will not proceed to <HI>Blows.</HI> It is therefore said that <HI>He doth not afflict willingly,</HI> and this work of punishing them is called <HI>his strange work:</HI> whereas he many times comes upon others suddenly, and they are surprized and cut off without any fore-warning given them.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>When he doth smite, he doth not do all at once.</HI> He doth not cut off his people at one stroak, though they have given him provoca|tion enough to do it. He doth not begin and make an end at the same time, and by the same Judgment by which he first Afflicted them: but if ever it must come to that, by reason of their wofull obstinacy and refusing to receive Correction by his Afflictive providences, there
<PB N="53" REF="000713_0053_0FA9AD1B0535A228">
is a very considerable time in which that is doing; and many leisurely steps are taken be|fore it arrives at this. When God threat|ens <HI>Niniveh,</HI> we find how it is exprest, <HI>Nah.</HI> 1. 9. <HI>He will make an utter end: Affliction shall not rise up the second time.</HI> Whereas it is ob|servable in our <HI>Text,</HI> laid by the <HI>Context,</HI> that there is a process from one to another, and from that to another, and there is a long time passeth before the evil be finished, and the last scene brought in: and if we observe, we shall find, that it was so long, after God had begun in his Judgments with his backsliding people of old, before they came to be extirpated, that the prophets begun to be mocked, and the peo|ple grew into such security, that they conclud|ed it should never be, and begun to make bold challenges about it. Now the reason of Gods using this method is, because he is in a way of <HI>Discipline</HI> with his people: he is trying if they will be <HI>amended</HI> by his rods, and there|fore, in wisdom, he proves another course, when one fails of doing the work, that so, if there may be any hope, they may not perish at last, but be led to repentance. It saith that he is very loth to destroy them, if there may be any prevention of it, by such courses as are proper.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Hence he is also wont to begin with lesser, &amp;
<PB N="54" REF="000713_0054_0FA9AD1BA4FDDD28">
more tolerable stroaks.</HI> He doth not come to the extremity at once, he proves them first with <HI>Rods,</HI> before he proceeds to make use of <HI>Scor|pions</HI> in punishing of them. And there is a double consideration under which this may be observed; It is either with respect to the <HI>Judg|ments themselves,</HI> or to the <HI>degrees</HI> in which he doth inflict them. Hence we have such a difference mentioned, <HI>Isa.</HI> 9. 1. <HI>When at first he lightly afflicted, &amp;c. and afterwards did more grie|vously afflict her.</HI> There are some Afflictions which in themselves are far less formidable than other; the nature of man is not so af|frighted at them, and hereupon there is not so great a discovery of the anger of God, at least as to the heat of it: we find <HI>David</HI> chose ra|ther <HI>to fall into the hands of God than of men,</HI> and God many times begins with such; these are the forlorn of his army which are first sent up to alarum a sinning people. He brings upon them <HI>Scarcity</HI> of the comforts of this life, by <HI>cutting short</HI> the fruits of the earth, and he visits them with <HI>Epidemical sicknesses,</HI> where|by they are <HI>brought low,</HI> and the like. There are also several degrees in the same kinds of Afflictions, whereby they prove more or less distressing to a people: and God useth to be|gin at the lower degrees; he comes first <HI>as a mo<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters"> to the house of Ephraim, Hos.</HI> 5. 12. He
<PB N="55" REF="000713_0055_0FA9AD1C0335ABA8">
diminisheth them, and shortens their comforts, brings difficulties and straits upon them, before he falls upon them in the severity of these. He brings scarcity before a killing Famine, gen|tler sicknesses before destroying Pestilences, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And the reason of this is, because he will prove them to see if <HI>their hearts be tender,</HI> and sensi|ble of the easier touches of his anger, that if they so be, there may be an end, and no fur|ther process made in the way of his wrath a|gainst them.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>But if the more easy Corrections will not do, he then goes on to smite them harder.</HI> If his hand may be stayed from this, well; but if it be not, he is not wont to tarry always where he was, and do no more, but he will, in due sea|son, go a step further, and make them to un|dergoe greater and more grievous Calamities, he doubles his stroaks, and pulls up the flood|gates higher, and makes the gap in the hedge wider, so that <HI>their Plagues become great and wonderfull:</HI> and this is observable in a treble respect; he doth it, partly by greatning the same stroaks, and so adding to the degrees of it, partly by bringing in of greater and more terrible Judgments, such as are more frightfull to men, and which carry in them more of his indignation, and in their own nature are dread|full: if scarcity and sickness will not do, if Fa|mines,

and Pestilences prevail not, he calls for <HI>a wasting Sword</HI> upon his land, and gives it a Commission <HI>to devour, and make it self drunk with the blood of the slaine.</HI> Partly also by heap|ing up of manifold Calamities at once upon them, involving of them in all sorts of difficul|ties, as, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 14. 21. <HI>How much more when I send my four sore Judgments upon Jerusalem, the Sword, and the Famine, and the noisome Beasts&punc; and the Pestilence:</HI> and these lay all wast before them, and they that escape the one&punc; are devoured of the other, and now they are terribly distrest.

If he had cut us off as soon as we be|gun to revolt from him, and given us no advan|tage at all to have made our peace with him, it had been just, and we could never have laid any injurious dealing to his charge: that there|fore he makes so many steps in it, and that he proceeds, so slowly in them all, is to be cor|dially and thankfully acknowledged by us; and we have reason to say, <HI>It is of the Lords mercy that we are not consumed, Lam.</HI>3. 22.

<HI>DOCT.</HI> VII. <HI>God is wont to use intermissions in his Afflicting of a people that will not reform under his Judgments.</HI></P>
<P>When he begins in a way of Judgment with them; when he takes his rod in hand and smites them, and they are not bettered by these smitings, yet as he proceeds very slowly in renewing and adding severity to his stroaks, according as was observed under the former <HI>Doctrine,</HI> so he makes many stops and delays in his progress, although he <HI>takes them out of one fire &amp; kindleth another upon them,</HI> as he threatens to do by them, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 15 7. Yet he hath his intervalls between. The manner of expression in the Text notes that God seeks, and conse|quently waits for their <HI>Reformation by these things,</HI> and that signifies such an intermission as this. And there are two things wherein it will be more especially discovered.</P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>He doth not speedily pass from one Judg|ment to another.</HI> When he brings one sort of Affliction upon his people, as a Testimony of his displeasure at them, he continues them un|der that for a considerable time, before he goes on to another; we read of a <HI>Famine</HI> in <HI>Davids</HI> time that continued for <HI>three years</HI> successively; and no other Judgment is recorded to inter|vene, though the procuring cause of it was not
<PB N="61" REF="000713_0061_0FA9AD244002D690">
presently removed; 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 21. And so in <HI>Eli|sha's</HI> time of a Famine which lasted <HI>three years,</HI> by which <HI>Israel,</HI> under <HI>Ahabs</HI> wicked reign was distressed; 1 <HI>Kings</HI> 18.1. And of one that lasted <HI>Seven years</HI> in the days of <HI>Elisha,</HI> in the time when <HI>Joram, Ahab's</HI> son, reigned, 2 <HI>King&punc;</HI> 8.1. And the reason why God doth thus is, because he will wait to see what efficacy this will have, before he takes a further course with them. He doth not come to <HI>kill</HI> them, but to <HI>cure</HI> them, if it may be; and hence he acts like a wife <HI>Physician,</HI> who, when he hath administred a proper sort of <HI>Potion,</HI> will wait for the working of it, a competent time, not looking that it will work, as soon as it is down, and if one potion do not do, he will give a|nother of the same, and it may be be a larger dose of it, before he leaves that of, and goes about to try any other experiment: he doth not presently say this will not do, though it doth not immediately appear in the desirable effects of it. God saith, it may be they will bethink themselves, and lay this Judgment to heart; and by the continuance of it be brought to solemn Consideration, which may set them upon Reformation; and therefore, till the Judgment comes to be notoriously despised by them, he many times continues them under exercise of it.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>And he sometimes gives them a present de|liverance,
<PB N="62" REF="000713_0062_0FA9AD24F99345E8">
and respite from the troubles which they have been exercised with.</HI> There are very fre|quently <HI>lucid intervals</HI> to be observed in the course of Gods providence towards a sinning people, whom he hath under the rod, and this notwithstanding they do not answer the end of these Afflictions, but do abide in their de|generacy. He doth <HI>not always grieve them,</HI> but, though they do not hearken to him; though they do not cease to provoke him, but are senseless, careless, and go on in their way, yet he extends a great deal of his pity to them, <HI>He remembers their frame,</HI> and he inter|poseth some great deliverance or other, and hereby tries them between with his mercy; to see if thus he may break their hearts with kindness, and let them experience how unwil|ling he is to do them hurt, if they do not force him to it. Hence he causeth the stormy clouds which hand over them, and showred trouble on them to break, and some beams of light and comfort to dart in between; and all to try if mercy after Judgment will do any thing with them; if his being before hand in his kindness to them, will melt their hard hearts into a compliance with his calls and counsels. And hereby at least he will leave them the more <HI>inexcusable</HI> if they yet persist in their obstinancy. Thus we find that in <HI>Ahabs</HI> reign, though the foregoing Famine had not wrought

the expected <HI>Reformation,</HI> and God brought a Sword after it; yet God gave Israel two sig|nal Victories over the <HI>Syrians,</HI> who had sorely distressed them, 1 <HI>Kings</HI> 20. And then in <HI>Jo|rams</HI> reign, God succoured that people with a strange relief in a grievous Famine and fright|ed away their enemies, when they were just ready to swallow them up, 2 <HI>Kings</HI> 7. And agen afterwards in the days of <HI>Jeroboam</HI> the second, of which we have that observable pas|sage, 2 <HI>Kings</HI> 14 24, 25, 26. <HI>He did that which was evil, &amp;c. he restored the coast of Israel, &amp;c. for the Lord saw the Affliction of Israel, &amp;c.</HI> And many a time hath God done after this man|ner with his people, when the entertainment they have given to his Judgments hath been a Provocation to him to do otherwise.</P>
<P><HI>USE. I. Learn hence how unreasonable a thing it is for such a people to maintain their rebellion against God.</HI> What reason can there possibly be given for their refusing to return to him, and reform the things that give him offense? How wonderfully doth God herein shew his tenderness and great compassion towards them? And one would think it should be enough to melt hearts of Adamant: that the hardest flint should dissolve under the influence of it. What greater provocation can there be given to God, than to have his <HI>Word</HI> despised, and
<PB N="64" REF="000713_0064_0FA9AD2671B84968">
<HI>Rod</HI> condemned, and a people under the ex|periment of both, obstinately stopping their ears and hardning their hearts? This is enough to put him upon resolving to spare them no more, to turn his <HI>Rod</HI> into a <HI>Sword,</HI> and pass from <HI>Correction</HI> to <HI>Vengeance,</HI> and cut them off at once. And shall he, for all this, hold back his hand when it is up, and shew his great kindness to a people that are not affected with his Judgment? Shall he endeavour thus to win them, after he hath Afflicted them to no purpose? And shall they for all, and after this persist in their former evil courses? May he not call upon <HI>Heaven and Earth to be asto|nished at this?</HI> How horrible and amazing a thing must it needs be?</P>
<P><HI>USE. II. Let it put us upon the tryal in this re|gard.</HI> Hath not our God dealt thus by us more than once or twise? Have there not been very notable respites which he hath af|forded unto us in the midst of our troubles? Hath he not mercifully given us several breath|ing times, and these considerable, between one Calamity and another? And what improve|ment is it that we have made of them? Did we not begin to hope that he was in the way of returning again to us? But have there not new clouds risen again afterwards, and show|red down a fresh tempest upon us? May we
<PB N="65" REF="000713_0065_0FA9AD2739354F38">
not use the moan which the Prophet doth in the name of his people? <HI>Jer.</HI> 8.15. <HI>We looked for peace, but behold no good; and for a time of health, and behold trouble.</HI> And it is good for us to enquire whence this is: surely if we had rightly understood the things of our peace, and accordingly improved such an opportunity wisely, it would not have been thus. If, when God looked as if he were coming towards us in <HI>away of mercy;</HI> we had cordially returned to him in <HI>away of Repentance and Reformation;</HI> those <HI>Daunings</HI> of deliverance, would have been the <HI>day break</HI> of our Salvations, and God would have established us in his favour. Let the thought then of this, convince us of our grievous folly, and lay us low before God. Alas! did we not begin arrogantly to say, <HI>the bitterness of death is over?</HI> to think that now the Judgments of God were at an end, and we should see no more of them? and there|upon to grow the more confident, and secure, and remorcless, and so to forget the obligati|ons lying upon us, and thereupon to promise our selves to enjoy peace, though we continu|ed in our old way and course? yea and here|upon have thrown by our thoughts of Refor|mation, supposing that all matters stood right and well between God and us? Is it not so? and if thus it be, how righteously hath God dealt with us, in raising up of new troubles,
<PB N="66" REF="000713_0066_0FA9AD2CA88A6EE8">
and bringing us into more perplexing Calami|ties than before? How must our mouths be stopt, and the holiness of God be adored by us in this respect? Certainly the face of pro|vidence calls aloud, for our putting of our selves upon such a trial; and let us account it our interest to comply with it solemnly.</P>
<P><HI>DOCT. VIII. As long as a professing people remain unreformed, God will proceed in his Judgments against them.</HI></P>
<P>This is the very sum and substance of the threatning contained in our <HI>Text:</HI> and it is <HI>thrice</HI> besides repeated in our <HI>Context.</HI> There may be many changes in the process which God is using with such a people, and he may see meet now and then to give them some in|termissions in that process: and herein he acts his own Sovereign pleasure: but for all this he will not so put an end to their troubles, nor is it to be expected. There are two things contained in this Doctrine, <ABBR><HI>Viz.</HI></ABBR></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>That there will be a proceeding in the way of Judgments.</HI> When God begins to take such a course with them, he will hold on in it, as long as they hold on in a course of impeni|tence and obstinacy: and though he hath kept them never so long under them; yet if there be no repentance, no <HI>Reformation</HI> wrought
<PB N="67" REF="000713_0067_0FA9AD2D473517C0">
on them by all, he will not so leave off, but will add still to Afflict them: he will proceed in his way, as long as they proceed in theirs. We therefore find, that when God had enu|murated how many several courses he had taken with Israel to reclaim them, and all had proved unsuccessful, and that is the remark which is made at the foot of every one of them, <HI>yet have ye not returned unto me saith the Lord, Am.</HI> 4.6. <HI>&amp;c.</HI> He gives them anuredly to understand that he will go on, and therefore bids them to look and prepare for it, <HI>Vers.</HI> 12. <HI>Therefore thus will I do unto O Israel; and be|cause I will do this unto thee, prepare to meet thy God, Oh Israel. q. d.</HI> Look for it, make ready; it shall certainly be.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>That there will be an encreasing or aggra|vating of these troubles.</HI> There shall not only be a continuance, but an augmentation; they shall meet with more and more severe; they shall be plagued yet deeper and deeper, and inextricably into their Afflictions and distres|ses. He therefore threatens to lay aside all pitty, <HI>Jer.</HI> 13.14. <HI>I will not have pitty, nor mercy, but destroy them. Ezek.</HI> 5.11. <HI>Neither shall mine eye spare, nor will I have any pitty.</HI> And this is intended, in his <HI>Punishing</HI> of them <HI>Seven times.</HI> And the ground of his thus proceeding will appear, in the Consideration of these things.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="68" REF="000713_0068_0FA9AD2E101E7AE8">
1. <HI>A Professing Covenant people are under greatest Obligations to glorify God, which is done by their faithfull obedience to his Commands.</HI> It is for this that God hath formed them into a people, under such circumstances, <HI>Isa.</HI> 43.21 <HI>This people have I formed for my self, they shall shew forth my praise.</HI> God requires it of them, and expects it from them; he doth not look for it from others to whom he hath not so revealed himself, but he saith of such a peo|ple for whom he hath done so much, more than for others, <HI>surely they will serve me, and honour me.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>When therefore such a people degenerate, they fall from the great end, which they were enjoyned, and every way advantaged to serve to, and so they dishonour instead of honouring him.</HI> And the truth is, there are none in the world that reflect so much of dishonour upon God, as such do: all the sin and wickedness of an <HI>Heathen</HI> people, doth not bring so much re|proach to his name, as the backslidings of such doe; his name suffers more by them, than by all the profligate abominations of those who are strangers to the Covenant: because his name is not so much concerned in them. And therefore, when these do the very same things for the matter of them, which the Heathen do; they do <HI>a great deal worse</HI> than these, and the reason of it is because it is they that do it.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="69" REF="000713_0069_0FA9AD2EB367BAA0">
3. <HI>Hence by their Apostasy they render them|selves unprofitable: and there are none more so than they.</HI> All the cost, and care, and peculiar husbandry that God hath laid out upon them is lost; he hath been at a great deal more of expense upon his <HI>Vineyard,</HI>than upon the wast wilderness; he hath fenced it, cleered it, and planted it, and afforded it a great deal of spe|cial tendance and this, as to any fruit which they bring forth for him, is thrown away up|on it. God on this account compares his peo|ple to a vine, which is a sort of plant, that if it bear well, and good grapes plentifully, is very excellent and usefull; but if it doth not so bear, it is <HI>good for nothing but to make a fire of: Ezek.</HI> 15. <HI>begin.</HI> Other trees, though they do not bear fruit, yet they may serve for many other uses, but the vine is altogether un|servicable in any other way but this.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>God in Afflicting of them, useth means, if it may be obtained, that he may bring them to their fruitfulness again.</HI> Whiles they enjoyed times of peace and prosperity, and all things went according to their desire, they grew wanton and left off to bring forth fruit to his praise; now these afflictive providences which he brings upon them, were his pruning and cut|ting of them; he hereby pares off their ex|crescencies, and lets them blood, and this, if any thing, looks as if it were probable to re|cover
<PB N="70" REF="000713_0070_0FA9AD2FF28B58A8">
them again. That this is the direct de|sign of these Judgments, herein appears, be|cause God saith, <HI>if they be net reformed by these things,</HI> and that plainly intimates, that <HI>Refor|mation</HI> was the thing that was looked for by them: and for this reason we shall find him so often complaining of them, because this was not the effect following upon them, see <HI>Isa.</HI> 1.5. <HI>Why should ye he smitten any more? ye will revolt more and more,</HI> and, <HI>Jer.</HI> 2.30. <HI>In vain have I smiten your Children; they would not re|ceive Correction.</HI> Now a thing is then said to be in vain, when the end of it is frustrated.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>Hence, as long as they remain not bettered hereby, their</HI> benefit <HI>and his</HI> Glory <HI>is concerned in his proceeding further in the course of his Judgments. Their benefit is deeply interested in it:</HI> for they are no whit bettered by these Afflictions, till they are wrought up unto Re|formation. The Physick that is Administred un|to men, works not for them, as long as it doth but irritate the disease, and makes the ill hu|mours to work more strongly, but doth not remove them&punc; then it works kindly, when it conquers the malady. And truly, if God leaves off Afflicting before such a people be reformed, they are apt to be thereby the more hardned; and when God is weary of smiting of them by reason of their obstinacy, it is a sad sign that he is about to give them
<PB N="71" REF="000713_0071_0FA9AD3517A89460">
up as desperate, <HI>Isa.</HI> 1. 5. <HI>Psa.</HI> 81. 11, 12 and 95. 10, 11. And when God lays by his <HI>Rod</HI> after he hath been using it, before his People are a|mended, it bodes that he intends next to take up the <HI>Sword,</HI> when he hath let them a|lone a while without check to fill up their measure. <HI>His Glory also is here concerned;</HI> He is in honour bound to bear a Testimony a|gainst the Apostasies of his People; and he must and will be at length too hard for them, one way or other his glory is trampled upon by their impenitence, his holiness cannot en|dure that it be always so: and therefore we are told that if after all endeavours, and ut|most patience drawn forth into long suffering, their returning be not obtained, at last it must come to extirpation, and scattering of them into the corners of the earth. The sum is, either Gods name must suffer; or else a peo|ple that are departed from their Covenant Obligations, and will by no means be refor|med, must be cut off; and so made the mo|numents of his righteous revenge, because they would not, <HI>hearken to his voice; Math.</HI> 23. 37, 38. <HI>How often would I have gathered you, but you would not; behold your house is left unto you desolate.</HI></P>
<P><HI>USE.</HI> I. <HI>This truth gives us a sad Prognostick of a People that are left to insensibleness and hard|ness
<PB N="72" REF="000713_0072_0FA9AD35B5F37660">
of heart, under the smitings of God.</HI> It tells us how miserable they are like to be. We are here given to understand that if they are resolved, God is resolved too: if they say <HI>there is no hope,</HI> but we will follow our own ways, and will not forsake them, God will also say, <HI>there is no hope,</HI> but you must see and feel the weight of the hand of his displeasure, and be made the monuments of his stupen|dous wrath. The best that is to be conclud|ded concerning such a People, is that they are like to be made to feel more amazing Judg|ments, than heretofore, there is no hope of an end being put to them, unless it be come to that, that he hath done striving with them in this way; and that is abundantly more formidable. And although God can, if he will, break their hearts after all, and when no means will do it, yet his Spirit is able to melt them down, and cast them anew; and sometimes he doth exalt his Sovereign Grace in doing of it, as, <HI>Isa.</HI> 57 18. <HI>I smote him, and he went on fro|wardly; I have seen his ways and will heal him.</HI> Yet this is Arbitrary with him; if they be|long to his Election of Grace, it shall be so; but that is a Secret thing; but as to the pre|sent posture of things, and referring to the <HI>Articles</HI> of the Covenant between God and such a People, it speaks sadly, and wofully bodes that their Calamities are but begun upon
<PB N="73" REF="000713_0073_0FA9AD362F63E1B8">
them. We may count from the breaking out of his displeasure, but who shall live to see the quenching of it, God alone knows; and whe|ther it may at last end graciously or no, we may expect to see God acting of fearfull <HI>Tra|gedies</HI> among them before he hath done, and we may be sure that he will either <HI>how</HI> them, or <HI>break</HI> them in pieces.</P>
<P><HI>USE.</HI> II. <HI>Let it then Solemnly call upon us, seriously to think of, and speedily to improve this Truth to a through Reformation.</HI> Let us take it to be a voice from Heaven to a|waken us this day to the practice of this duty. God hath now for a long time been calling us aloud to <HI>REFORMATION;</HI> and that by many ways and courses that he hath been practising with us. How many years since he put it into the mouths of his Servants to complain of the Degenerating of this Peo|ple, from the Spirit and design of those that were first employed in the Planting of these <HI>Churches?</HI> How many years is it since there have been Convincing and openly Confessed witnesses in the Providence of God, to the displeasure he had taken at that degeneracy? And doth he not continue these tokens unto this day? But our ears have been sealed; and though we have been under some Consterna|tions, especially when some distressing Afflicti|on
<PB N="74" REF="000713_0074_0FA9AD36FA2E60F0">
hath broken in upon us, yet how little is there done mean while, towards the putting an end to Gods Controversy? God is still onward in his way, and proceeding from one step to another, and going forward to punish us more and more, <HI>and shall we never be in|structed? Oh when shall it once be?</HI> Is there no|thing to be done at such a day as this is? Are all things right? Have there been no open and notorious declensions from God a|mong us? Or are we recovered out of them? Is every thing among us as it should be? <HI>Why then is his hand stretched out still?</HI> What means the continuing and blowing up of the heat of his anger? And is it no bodies work to be|gin in this matter? or is it not every ones business to set about it in his place? If we are in a <HI>Private Capacity,</HI> and cannot active|ly influence the Publick so as to mend it, yet may we not mend one? Are there not our Personal iniquities in the heap or <HI>Ephah?</HI> or have we carried it so evenly and holily as to be altogether clear of this guilt? Who of us is there that dares to appear, and own that we have done nothing to the continu|ance of these Judgments? And if every one would do that which is to be done at home in this regard, it would surely Contribute not a little to a general <HI>Reformation:</HI> and we may by an holy exemplary Conversation, and
<PB N="75" REF="000713_0075_0FA9AD396F16C388">
earnest Prayers to God, help forward this work. If we are in a <HI>Publick station,</HI> and thereby advantaged peculiarly to put for|ward such a work; shall we <HI>look one upon a|nother,</HI> and strain Complements, who shall be|gin in it? Shall we not father joyn hearts, and hands, and counsels in this business? Shall any of us draw back, and refuse to be con|cerned in it; or shall we withstand it? <HI>Note that man an Enemy to God and his People.</HI> I shall not here enlarge in enumerating the <HI>Catalogue</HI> of those things that want to be lookt into and after in this <HI>Reformation,</HI> but earnestly wish that it may be a matter of Solemn Consultation and enquiry. Only let me say, this work must be done sooner or later: God expects it, he calls aloud for it, he saith that he will have it. And what will it advantage us to dally and delay, till God hath multiplied his Judgments upon us, and made us a <HI>by word and an astonishment to the world?</HI> Assure we our selves it may be worse, but it will not be really better with us, till we come roundly to this work. Why then should we provoke a good and a gracious God to more wrath, and pull down on our own heads more of his fearful Judgments? Stay him now; ruine else may be not far off. We have tried our carnal policy already, and have found it nothing to avail us, but rather
<PB N="76" REF="000713_0076_0FA9AD3A65379298">
to entangle us in greater perplexities, and more inextricable: let us now essay the Spiritu|al policy. Resolve we, from this day for|ward to make diligent search after, and utterly to renounce all our sins; to Return as one man to the Lord; and set our selves in good earnest about this work: and I dare say, <HI>God will be jealous for the land, and pitty his People; and then will he arise as a strong man after new wine, plead our cause for us, and bring us forth out of darkness into the light, set our feet upon a Rock, and put a new Song into our mouths, even Praise unto our GOD. Amen.</HI></P>
