<OPENER><SALUTE>GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE time is at la&s;t arrived, when the people of France, by re&s;orting to their own proper dignity, feel them&s;elves at liberty to exerci&s;e their unembarra&s;&s;ed rea&s;on, in e&s;tabli&s;hing an equal government. The pre&s;ent cri&s;is in your affairs, marked by the a&s;&s;embling of a National Convention, bears nearly the &s;ame relation to the la&s;t four years of your hi&s;tory, as your whole revolution bears to the great accumulated ma&s;s of modern improvement. Compared therefore with all that is pa&s;t, it is perhaps
<PB N="4" REF="025143_0003_0FCE6BD80522A6C8">
the mo&s;t intere&s;ting portion of the mo&s;t important period that Europe has hitherto &s;een.</P>
<P>Under this impre&s;&s;ion, and with the deepe&s;t &s;en&s;e of the magnitude of the &s;ub|ject which engages your attention, I take a liberty which no &s;light motives could warrant in a &s;tranger, the liberty of offer|ing a few ob&s;ervations on the bu&s;ine&s;s that lies before you. Could I &s;uppo&s;e however that any apology were nece&s;&s;ary for this intru&s;ion, I &s;hould not rely upon the one here mentioned. But my intentions re|quire no apology; I demand to be heard, as a right. Your cau&s;e is that of human nature at large; you are the repre&s;entatives of mankind; and though I am not literally one of your con&s;tituents, yet I mu&s;t be bound by your decrees. My happine&s;s will be &s;eriou&s;ly affected by your delibera|tions; and in them I have an intere&s;t, which nothing can de&s;troy. I not only con&s;ider all mankind as forming but one great family, and therefore bound by a natural &s;ympathy to regard each other's
<PB N="5" REF="025143_0004_0FCE6BD8F39EB0F0">
happine&s;s as making part of their own; but I contemplate the French nation at this moment as &s;tanding in the place of the whole. You have &s;tepped forward with a gigantic &s;tride to an enterprize which involves the intere&s;ts of every &s;urrounding nation; and what you began as ju&s;tice to your&s;elves, you are called upon to fini&s;h as a duty to the human race.</P>
<P>I believe no man cheri&s;hes a greater veneration, than I have uniformly done, for the National A&s;&s;embly who framed that Con&s;titution, which I now pre&s;ume your con&s;tituents expect you to revi&s;e. Perhaps the merits of that body of men will never be properly appreciated. The greate&s;t part of their exertions were ne|ce&s;&s;arily &s;pent on objects which cannot be de&s;cribed; and which from their nature can make no figure in hi&s;tory. The enormous weight of abu&s;es they had to overturn, the quantity of prejudice with which their functions called them to con|tend, as well in their own minds as in tho&s;e of all the European world, the open
<PB N="6" REF="025143_0005_0FCE6BDD0D418248">
oppo&s;ition of intere&s;ts, the &s;ecret weapons of corruption, and the unbridled fury of de&s;pairing faction,&mdash;the&s;e are &s;ubjects which e&s;cape our common ob&s;ervation, when we contemplate the labours of that A&s;&s;embly. But the legacy they have left to their country in their deliberative capa|city will remain a la&s;ting monument to their prai&s;e; and though while &s;earching out the defective parts of their work, without lo&s;ing &s;ight of the difficulties under which it was formed, we may find more occa&s;ion to admire its wi&s;dom, than to murmur at its faults; yet this con&s;ider|ation ought not to deter us from the at|tempt.</P>
<P>The great leading principle, on which their con&s;titution was meant to be founded, is <HI>the equality of rights.</HI> This principle being laid down with &s;uch clearne&s;s, and a&s;&s;erted with &s;o much dignity in the be|ginning of the code, it is &s;trange that men of clear under&s;tandings &s;hould fail to be charmed with the beauty of the &s;y&s;tem which nature mu&s;t have taught them to build
<PB N="7" REF="025143_0006_0FCE6BDE4E79A870">
on that foundation. It &s;hows a di&s;po&s;ition to counteract the analogy of nature, to &s;ee them at one moment, impre&s;&s;ing this indelible principle on our minds, and with the next breath declaring, That France &s;hall remain a monarchy,&mdash;that it &s;hall have a king, hereditary, inviolable, clothed with all the executive, and much of the legi&s;lative power, commander in chief of all the national force by land and &s;ea, having the initiative of war, and the power of concluding peace;&mdash;and above all, to hear them declare, that
<Q>The nation will provide for the &s;plendour of the throne,</Q>
granting in their legi&s;lative capacity to that throne more than a million &s;terling a year, from the national pur&s;e, be&s;ides the rents of e&s;tates which are &s;aid to amount to half as much more.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t be a&s;toni&s;hed at the paradoxi|cal organization of the minds of men who could &s;ee no di&s;cordance in the&s;e ideas. They begin with the open &s;implicity of a rational republic, and immediately plunge into all the labyrinths of royalty; and a
<PB N="8" REF="025143_0007_0FCE6BE348C88900">
great part of the con&s;titutional code is a practical attempt to reconcile the&s;e two di&s;cordant theories. It is a perpetual con|flict between principle and precedent,&mdash; between the manly truths of nature, which we all mu&s;t feel, and the learned &s;ubtilties of &s;tate&s;men, about which we have been taught to rea&s;on.</P>
<P>In reviewing the hi&s;tory of human opi|nions, it is an unplea&s;ant con&s;ideration to remark how &s;low the mind has always been in &s;eizing the mo&s;t intere&s;ting truths; al|though, when di&s;covered, they appear to have been the mo&s;t obvious. This re|mark is no where verified with more cir|cum&s;tances of regret, than in the progre&s;s of your ideas in France relative to the inutility of the kingly office. It was not enough that you took your fir&s;t &s;tand upon the high ground of natural right; where, enlightened by the &s;un of rea&s;on, you might have &s;een the clouds of prejudice roll far beneath your feet&mdash;it was not enough that you began by con&s;idering royalty, with its well-known &s;courges, as being the cau&s;e of
<PB N="9" REF="025143_0008_0FCE6BE4EDD9ABC0">
all your evils,&mdash;that the kings of modern Europe are the authors of war and mi&s;ery, that their mutual intercour&s;e is a com|merce of human &s;laughter,&mdash;that public debts and private oppre&s;&s;ions, with all the degrading vices that tarni&s;h the face of na|ture, had their origin in that &s;pecies of government which offers a premium for wickedne&s;s, and teaches the few to trample on the many;&mdash;it was not enough that you &s;aw the means of a regeneration of mankind in the &s;y&s;tem of equal rights, and that in a wealthy and powerful nation you po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the advantage of reducing that &s;y&s;tem to immediate practice, as an exam|ple to the world and a con&s;olation to hu|man nature. All the&s;e argument, with a variety of others which your republican orators placed in the &s;tronge&s;t point of light, were in&s;ufficient to rai&s;e the public mind to a proper view of the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>It &s;eems that &s;ome of your own philo&s;o|phers had previou&s;ly taught, that royalty was nece&s;&s;ary to a great nation. Monte&s;|quieu, among his whim&s;ical maxims about
<PB N="10" REF="025143_0009_0FCE6BE5CCF0B6B0">
laws and government, had informed the world, that a limited monarchy was the be&s;t po&s;&s;ible &s;y&s;tem, and that a democracy could never flouri&s;h, but in a &s;mall tract of country. How many of your legi&s;lators believed in this doctrine, how many acted from tempori&s;ing motives, wi&s;hing to ba|ni&s;h royalty by &s;low degrees, and how many were led, by principles le&s;s pardon|able than either, it is impo&s;&s;ible to deter+mine. Certain it is, that republican ideas gained no ground upon the monarchical in your con&s;tituting a&s;&s;embly, during the la&s;t &s;ix months of their deliberations. It is likewi&s;e certain, that the majority of that a&s;&s;embly took much pains to prevent the people from di&s;covering the cheat of roy|alty, and to continue their ancient venera|tion, at lea&s;t for a while, in favour of cer|tain principles in government which rea|&s;on could not approve.</P>
<P>It is remarkable that all the perfidy of your king, at the time of his flight, &s;hould have had &s;o little effect in opening the eyes of &s;o enlightened a people as the French.
<PB N="11" REF="025143_0010_0FCE6BE7341530E0">
His flight, and the in&s;ulting declaration which he left behind him, were &s;ufficient not only to give the lie to the fiction, with which common &s;en&s;e has always been put to the blu&s;h, and to which your a&s;&s;embly had attempted to give a &s;anction, <HI>that kings can do no wrong,</HI> but they were &s;ufficient to &s;how, at lea&s;t to all who would open their eyes, that the bu&s;ine&s;s of government required no &s;uch officer. There is no period during your revolution, if there is any to be found in the hi&s;tory of France, when bu&s;ine&s;s went on with more alacrity and good order, than during the &s;u&s;pen|&s;ion of the royal functions in the interval from the time that the king was brought back to the capital in June, until the com|pletion of the con&s;titution in September. Every thing went right in the kingdom, except within the walls of the a&s;&s;embly. A majority of that body was determined to make an experiment of a limited monarchy. The experiment has been made. Its du|ration has indeed been &s;hort, being le&s;s than eleven months; but, although in
<PB N="12" REF="025143_0011_0FCE6BEB302AE308">
&s;ome re&s;pects it has been almo&s;t as fatal to the cau&s;e of liberty as any &s;y&s;tem could have been within the time, yet in other re&s;pects it has done more good than all the rea&s;onings of all the philo&s;ophers of the age could have done in a much longer time: it has taught them a new doctrine, which no experience can &s;hake, and which rea&s;on mu&s;t confirm, <HI>that kings can do no good.</HI> So that, if the que&s;tion were now to be agitated by the people of France, as it may be by you in their behalf, whe|ther they will have a king or not, I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e the following would be the &s;tate of the calculation: A certain quantity of evils are to be expected from the regal office; and the&s;e evils are of two cla&s;&s;es, <HI>certain</HI> and <HI>probable.</HI> The <HI>certain</HI> evils are, 1. The million and a half &s;terling a year drawn from the people to
<Q>&s;upport the &s;plendour of the throne;</Q>
2. A great va|riety of enormous &s;alaries paid to mini&s;ters at home, to amba&s;&s;adors abroad, and to bi&s;hops in the church; while the only bu&s;ine&s;s of the&s;e men and their &s;alaries
<PB N="13" REF="025143_0012_0FCE6BEBF95EA540">
is, to &s;upport the fiction, that kings can do no wrong. It will always co&s;t more to &s;upport this fiction, than it would to &s;up|port the whole national government with|out it. 3. The wor&s;t of all the certain evils is, that the million and a half will be nearly all &s;pent in bribery and corrup|tion among the members of the legi&s;lature, to increa&s;e the power of the throne, and the means of oppre&s;&s;ion. If the money, after it is extorted from the people, could be thrown into the &s;ea, in&s;tead of being paid to the king and his &s;atellites, the evil would be trifling; in that ca&s;e the wicked|ne&s;s would cea&s;e with the fir&s;t act of in|ju&s;tice; while in this it multiplies the weapons of de&s;truction again&s;t them&s;elves. It creates a perpetual &s;crambling for power, rewards knavery in the higher ranks, en|courages fal&s;ehood in others, and corrupts the morals of the whole. This it is that deba&s;es and vilifies the general ma&s;s of mankind, and brings upon them the in|&s;ulting remarks of many men, who even wi&s;h them well, <HI>that the people are unfit for liberty.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="025143_0013_0FCE6BED37178018">Among the <HI>probable</HI> evils re&s;ulting from the kingly office, the principal one, and indeed the only one that needs to be men|tioned, is the chance of its being held by a <HI>weak or a wicked man.</HI> When the office is hereditary, it is &s;carcely to be expected but that this &s;hould always be the ca&s;e. Con|&s;idering the birth and education of princes, the chance of finding one with practical common &s;en&s;e is hardly to be reckoned among po&s;&s;ible events; nor is the proba|bility le&s;s &s;trong again&s;t their having vir|tue. The temptations to wickedne&s;s ari&s;|ing from their &s;ituation are too powerful to be re&s;i&s;ted. The per&s;ua&s;ive arts of all their flatterers, the companions of their youth, the mini&s;ters of their plea&s;ures, and every per&s;on with whom they ever con|ver&s;e, are nece&s;&s;arily employed to induce them to increa&s;e their revenue, by op|pre&s;&s;ing the people, whom they are taught from their cradle to con&s;ider as bea&s;ts of burthen. And what mu&s;t almo&s;t in&s;ure the triumph of wickedne&s;s in their tempers, is the idea that they act totally and for ever without re&s;traint. This is an allurement
<PB N="15" REF="025143_0014_0FCE6BF03907F1F0">
to vice that even men of &s;en&s;e could &s;carcely re&s;i&s;t. Impre&s;s it on the mind of any man that he <HI>can do no wrong,</HI> and he will &s;oon convince you of your mi&s;take.</P>
<P>Take this general &s;ummary of the evils ari&s;ing from hereditary monarchy, under any re&s;trictions that can be propo&s;ed, and place it on one &s;ide of the account,&mdash;and &s;tate, on the other &s;ide, the truth which I believe no man of reflection will hereafter call in que&s;tion, <HI>that kings can do no good,</HI> and the friends of liberty will no longer be in doubt which way you will decide the que&s;tion relative to that part of your con|&s;titution.</P>
<P>I cannot feel ea&s;y in di&s;mi&s;&s;ing this part of my &s;ubject, without offering &s;ome remarks on that general vague idea which has long been floating about in the world, that a people under certain circum&s;tances are unfit for liberty. You know in what in&s;ulting language this ob|&s;ervation has been perpetually applied to the French during the cour&s;e of the
<PB N="16" REF="025143_0015_0FCE6BF3F79F2A90">
revolution. Some have &s;aid, that they were too <HI>ignorant</HI> to form a government of their own, others, that they were too <HI>poor,</HI> others that they were too <HI>numerous,</HI> and others, that they were too <HI>vitious.</HI> I will not de&s;cend to the examination of the particular parts of this charge, nor of the whole as applied to the French, or to any other particular people; I will only remark on the general ob&s;ervation, as ap|plicable to any po&s;&s;ible nation exi&s;ting in a &s;tate of nature. By a &s;tate of nature I mean a &s;tate of peace; where the intention is, as a nation, to live by indu&s;try at home, not by plunder from abroad.</P>
<P>I think Monte&s;quieu has &s;aid, that virtue mu&s;t be the foundation of a republican go|vernment. His book is not now by me, or I would try to di&s;cover what he means by virtue. If he means tho&s;e moral ha|bits by which men are di&s;po&s;ed to mutual ju&s;tice and benevolence, which is the common idea of virtue, it cannot be the foundation of a republican government, or of any government. The&s;e qualities re|quire
<PB N="17" REF="025143_0016_0FCE6BF576FEE738">
no re&s;traints: the more general their influence &s;hould be among any people, the le&s;s force would be nece&s;&s;ary in their go|vernment; and could we &s;uppo&s;e a nation in which they &s;hould exi&s;t in a perfect de|gree, that nation would require no govern|ment at all. It is the vices, not the vir|tues of men which are the objects of re|&s;traint, and the foundation of government. The expre&s;&s;ion of the general will, operat|ing on the mind of an individual, &s;erves with him as a &s;ub&s;titute for virtue. This general will may always be expre&s;&s;ed by a nation in any po&s;&s;ible circum&s;tances; and, if the nation be in a &s;tate of nature, this expre&s;&s;ion will always be <HI>moral virtue,</HI> ac|cording to their ideas of the word; and it will always <HI>tend</HI> to moral virtue, in the mo&s;t exten&s;ive &s;en&s;e in which we have yet been able to define it.</P>
<P>It has been &s;aid, that man differs from man, as much as man from bea&s;t; it is &s;aid al&s;o to be fit, that the wi&s;e and virtu|ous &s;hould make laws for the ignorant and vitious. It is not to my purpo&s;e to call in
<PB N="18" REF="025143_0017_0FCE6BF7E0131AF8">
que&s;tion the fir&s;t of the&s;e a&s;&s;ertions: but the &s;econd, plau&s;ible as it is, I mu&s;t totally deny; at lea&s;t in the &s;en&s;e in which it is generally under&s;tood. That &s;ome men in the &s;ame &s;ociety &s;hould be wi&s;er and better than others, is very natural; and it is as natural, that the people &s;hould choo&s;e &s;uch to repre&s;ent them in the formation of laws. But in this ca&s;e the laws originate from the people at large, ignorant and vi|tious as they are; and the repre&s;entatives are only the organs by which their will is declared. This is not the &s;en&s;e in which the a&s;&s;ertion is intended. It is meant, that if kings were always wi&s;e and good, or if a band of nobles were always wi&s;e and good, it would be be&s;t that they &s;hould de the hereditary legi&s;lators. This is the &s;en&s;e in which I deny the a&s;&s;ertion, becau&s;e it is contrary to the analogy of nature. It being a &s;ubject on which we cannot look for experience, we mu&s;t rea&s;on only from analogy; and it appears extremely evident to me, that, were a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the wi&s;e&s;t and be&s;t men that ever have, or ever will be known, to be perpetuated in any coun|try
<PB N="19" REF="025143_0018_0FCE6BF934D08DB8">
as independent legi&s;lators for the peo|ple, the happine&s;s and good government of the nation would be greatly injured by it. I am confident that any people, whe|ther virtuous or vitious, wi&s;e or ignorant, numerous or few, rich or poor, are the be&s;t judges of their own wants relative to the re&s;traint of laws, and would always &s;upply tho&s;e wants better than they could be &s;up|plied by others.</P>
<P>In expre&s;&s;ing the&s;e ideas on the peace and happine&s;s to be expected from a free repub|lic, I have been often accu&s;ed of holding too favourable an opinion of human nature. But it appears to me, that the que&s;tion, whether men, on any given portion of the earth, are able to make their own laws, does not depend in the lea&s;t on their moral cha|racter. It has no relation to their &s;tate of improvement, or their &s;tate of morals. The only previous enquiry is, What is the object to be aimed at in the govern|ment? If it be the good of the whole community, the whole can be&s;t know the means of pur&s;uing it; If it be to exalt a
<PB N="20" REF="025143_0019_0FCE6BFE359EDE20">
few men at the expence of all the re&s;t, the deci&s;ion, perhaps, may take a different turn.</P>
<P>A republic of beavers or of monkies, I believe, could not be benefited by receiv|ing their laws from men, any more than men could be in being governed by them. If the Algerines or the Hindoos were to &s;hake off the yoke of de&s;poti&s;m, and adopt ideas of equal liberty, they would that moment be in a condition to frame a bet|ter government for them&s;elves, than could be framed for them by the mo&s;t learned &s;tate&s;man in the world. If the great Mr. Locke, with all his wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s, were to attempt the ta&s;k, he would probably &s;ucceed as ill as he did in his con&s;titution for the colony of South Carolina.</P>
<P>Colonies have always been teazed and tormented more or le&s;s (and probably al|ways will be as long as colonies &s;hall exi&s;t) by the overweening wi&s;dom of the mo|ther-country, in making their laws and con&s;titutions. This is often done without
<PB N="21" REF="025143_0020_0FCE6BFF37C319C8">
any wi&s;h to tyrannize, and &s;ometimes with the be&s;t intentions to promote the good of the people. The misfortune more fre|quently lies in the legi&s;lator's not knowing the wants and wi&s;hes of the people, than in any wanton de&s;ire to counteract them. The &s;ure and only characteri&s;tic of a good law is, <HI>that it be the perfect expre&s;&s;ion of the will of the nation;</HI> its excellence is pre|ci&s;ely in proportion to the univer&s;ality and freedom of con&s;ent. And this defini|tion remains the &s;ame, whatever be the character of the nation, or the object of the law. Every man, as an individual, has a will of his own, and a manner of expre&s;&s;ing it. In forming the&s;e individuals into &s;ociety, it is nece&s;&s;ary to form their wills into a government; and in doing this, we have only to find the ea&s;ie&s;t and cleare&s;t mode of expre&s;&s;ing their wills in a national manner. And no po&s;&s;ible di&s;advantages relative to their &s;tate of morals or civiliza|tion can render this a difficult ta&s;k.</P>
<P>I have gone into the&s;e arguments, not merely to prove that the <HI>French</HI> are fit for
<PB N="22" REF="025143_0021_0FCE6C00B3E38220">
liberty, who are certainly at this moment the mo&s;t enlightened nation in Europe; but to &s;how that the calumny contained in the contrary a&s;&s;ertion need not be repeated again&s;t any other nation, who &s;hould make the like exertions, and who&s;e preten&s;ions, in this re&s;pect, might appear more que&s;|tionable in the eye of fa&s;hionable remark.</P>
<P>But it will be &s;aid, I am too late with all the&s;e ob&s;ervations on the nece&s;&s;ity of pro&s;cribing royalty from your con&s;titution. The cau&s;e is already judged in the minds of the whole people of France; and their wi&s;hes will &s;urely be the rule of your con|duct. I &s;uppo&s;e that, without being re|minded of your duty by a &s;tranger, one of your fir&s;t re&s;olutions would be, to fix a national anathema on every ve&s;tige of regal power, and endeavour to wipe out from the human character the &s;tain which it receiv|ed, with its veneration for kings and he|reditary claims. But it requires much reflection to be well aware to what extent this duty &s;hould carry you. There are many vices in your con&s;titution, which,

the &s;hackles of royalty, it finds it&s;elf it a new world. It ri&s;es to a more exten&s;ive view of every circum&s;tance of the &s;ocial &s;tate.

In this ca&s;e, it is a long time before we acquire a habit of tracing effects to their proper cau&s;es, and of applying the ea&s;y and &s;imple remedy to tho&s;e vices of our nature which &s;ociety requires us to re&s;train. This, I apprehend, is the &s;ource of by far the greate&s;t difficulties with which you have to contend.

<P>Much has been &s;aid, &s;ince the beginning of your revolution, on the difference be|tween the bu&s;ine&s;s of framing con&s;titutions, and that of ordinary legi&s;lation. Indeed I am afraid that either too much or too little has been inculcated on this &s;ubject; be|cau&s;e it appears to me, that the doctrine now received is not that which the &s;ub|ject would naturally &s;ugge&s;t. It teaches us to con&s;ider tho&s;e laws that are called <HI>Con&s;titutions,</HI> in a light &s;o &s;acred, as to &s;a|vour too much of the old leaven of vene|ration for precedent; and every degree of &s;uch veneration is &s;o much taken from the chance of improvement. To &s;uppo&s;e that our predece&s;&s;ors were wi&s;er than our|&s;elves is not an extraordinary thing, though
<PB N="29" REF="025143_0028_0FCE6C0FB6B412F8">
the opinion may be ill-founded; but to &s;uppo&s;e that they can have left us a better &s;y&s;tem of political regulations than we can make for our&s;elves, is to a&s;cribe to them a degree of di&s;cernment to which our own bears no compari&s;on; it &s;uppo&s;es them to have known our condition by prophecy better than we can know it by experi|ence.</P>
<P>There was not only a degree of arro|gance in your fir&s;t a&s;&s;embly, in &s;uppo&s;ing that they had framed a con&s;titution, which for a number of years would require no amendment; but they betrayed a great degree of weakne&s;s in imagining that the ridiculous barriers with which they fenced it round would be &s;ufficient to re&s;train the powerful weight of opinion, and prevent the people from exerci&s;ing the irre&s;i&s;tible right of innovation, whenever experience &s;hould di&s;cover the defects of the &s;y&s;tem. It is partly to the&s;e barriers, as well as to the inherent vices of the con&s;titution, that we are to attribute the late in&s;urrections in Paris. If we would trace the cau&s;es of
<PB N="30" REF="025143_0029_0FCE6C153492D8D8">
popular commotions, we &s;hould always find them to have originated in a previous unju&s;t re&s;traint.</P>
<P>I would not however be under&s;tood to mean, that there &s;hould be no di&s;tinction between the con&s;titutional code, and other occa&s;ional laws. There is room for a con|&s;iderable difference, both as to the mode of expre&s;&s;ing them, and as to the formali|ties proper to be ob&s;erved in repealing or amending them. I will offer &s;ome remarks on a plan for amendments towards the clo&s;e of my letter. With regard to the general complexion of the code, it ought to be as &s;imply expre&s;&s;ed and ea&s;y to be under&s;tood as po&s;&s;ible; for it ought to &s;erve not only as a guide to the legi&s;lative body, but as a political grammar to all the citi|zens. The greate&s;t &s;ervice to be expected from it is, that it &s;hould concentrate the maxims, and form the habits of thinking, for the whole community. For this pur|po&s;e, it is not &s;ufficient that it be puri|fied from every ve&s;tige of monarchy, and hierarchy, with all the impo&s;itions and in|equalities
<PB N="31" REF="025143_0030_0FCE6C1696EA4988">
which have &s;prung in&s;en&s;ibly from the&s;e ideas; but it &s;hould contemplate the whole circle of human propen&s;ities, and cut off the temptations and opportuni|ties for degenerating into tho&s;e evils which have &s;o long afflicted mankind, and from which we are now but beginning to ari&s;e.</P>
<P>After laying down the great fundamen|tal principle <HI>that all men are equal in their rights,</HI> it ought to be the invariable object of the &s;ocial compact to in&s;ure the exerci&s;e of that equality, by rendering them as equal in all &s;orts of enjoyments, as can po&s;&s;ibly be con&s;i&s;tent with good order, in|du&s;try, and the reward of merit. Every individual ought to be rendered as <HI>inde|pendent</HI> of every other individual as po&s;&s;i|ble; and at the &s;ame time as <HI>dependent</HI> as po&s;&s;ible on the whole community. On this undeniable maxim, I think the follow|ing po&s;itions ought to be founded and guaranteed in the con&s;titutional code:</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="025143_0031_0FCE6C1923DB65C8"><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> The only ba&s;is of repre&s;entation in the government &s;hould be <HI>population</HI>; territory and property, though ab&s;urdly &s;tated by your fir&s;t a&s;&s;embly as making part of the ba&s;is of repre&s;entation, have no intere&s;t in it. Property, in it&s;elf, conveys no right to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, but the right of enjoying it. To &s;ay that it has the right of claiming for it&s;elf the protection of &s;ociety, is ab&s;urd; becau&s;e it is already protected, or it would not be property. It is the <HI>per&s;on,</HI> not the property, that exer|ci&s;es the will, and is capable of enjoying happine&s;s; it is therefore the per&s;on, for whom government is in&s;tituted, and by whom its functions are performed. The rea&s;on why property has been con&s;idered as conveying additional rights to the po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;or in matters of government, is the &s;ame as has blinded the under&s;tandings of men rela|tive to the whole order of nature in &s;ociety. It is one of tho&s;e appendages of monarchy and oligarchy, which teaches that the ob|ject of government is to increa&s;e the &s;plen|dour of the few, and the misfortunes of the
<PB N="33" REF="025143_0032_0FCE6C1A5089B038">
many. And every &s;tep that &s;uch govern|ments take has a tendency to counteract the equality of rights, by de&s;troying the equality of enjoyments.</P>
<P><HI>Second,</HI> If you take population as the only ba&s;is of repre&s;entation in the depart|ments, the next &s;tep will be, to declare every independent man to be an active ci|tizen. By an independent man, I mean every man whom the laws do not place under the control of another, by rea&s;on of nonage or dome&s;ticity. The laws of France, in my opinion, have always placed the pe|riod of majority by &s;everal years too late; that is, later than nature has placed it. This however, was of little con&s;equence in a political view, as long as the go|vernment remained de&s;potic; but now, when the rights of man are re&s;tored, and government is built on that foundation, it is of con&s;equence to increa&s;e as far as po&s;&s;ible the number of active citizens. And for this purpo&s;e I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e the period of majority ought to be placed at lea&s;t as early as the age of twenty years.
<PB N="34" REF="025143_0033_0FCE6C1BD58D8C30">
To make this change in France would be attended with many advantages. I would increa&s;e the &s;tock of knowledge, and of indu&s;try, by in&s;piring young men with early ideas of independence, and the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of providing for them&s;elves by &s;ome u&s;eful employment: it would be a great inducement to early marriages; and, by that means, increa&s;e population, and encourage purity of morals.</P>
<P>I am likewi&s;e fully convinced, that the a&s;&s;embly was wrong in &s;uppo&s;ing that a &s;tate of dome&s;ticity ought to deprive a man of the rights of a freeman. This is a re|lick of tho&s;e ideas which the ancient go|vernment has in&s;pired. Where a &s;ervant is ab&s;olutely dependent on the caprice of a ma&s;ter for his place, and con&s;equently for his bread, there is indeed much force in the argument, that he can have no politi|cal will of his own; and will give his &s;uf|frage as directed by the ma&s;ter. But when every man &s;hall be ab&s;olutely free to fol|low any profe&s;&s;ion, every kind of u&s;eful indu&s;try being equally encouraged and re|warded;
<PB N="35" REF="025143_0034_0FCE6C1D5CA3B9E0">
and e&s;pecially when every man &s;hall be well in&s;tructed in his duties and his rights, which will certainly be the con&s;equence of the &s;y&s;tem you have now begun,&mdash;&s;uch arguments will fall to the ground with the &s;y&s;tem which they &s;up|port. The &s;ervant and his ma&s;ter, though not equal in property or in talents, may be perfectly &s;o in freedom and in virtue. Wherever the &s;ervant is more dependent on the ma&s;ter, than the ma&s;ter on the &s;ervant, there is &s;omething wrong in the government. The &s;ame remarks I believe may be repeat|ed, with little variation, in the ca&s;e of in&s;olvent debtors, another cla&s;s of men di&s;|franchi&s;ed by the fir&s;t a&s;&s;embly.</P>
<P><HI>Third,</HI> The manner in which citizen&s;hip may be acquired or lo&s;t, is a &s;ubject which ought to be recon&s;idered by you; as your predece&s;&s;ors have left in it &s;ome room for improvement. Their regulation was in|deed a liberal one, compared with what other governments have done; but not &s;o, when compared with what the &s;ubject re|quired. I am confident that when &s;ociety
<PB N="36" REF="025143_0035_0FCE6C1EB2777AB8">
&s;hall be placed on the right footing, the citizens of any one &s;tate will con&s;ider tho&s;e of any other &s;tate as their brothers and fellow citizens of the world; and in this ca&s;e, when tho&s;e who are called foreigners come to &s;ettle among them, a mere decla|ration of their intention of re&s;idence will be &s;ufficient to entitle them to all the rights which the natives po&s;&s;e&s;s. I was anxious that the French &s;hould &s;et the example in this &s;pecies of liberality, as they have done in &s;o many other good things; and I &s;till believe, that on reviewing the &s;ubject, you will do it.</P>
<P>But according to your con&s;titution there are many ways in which the rights of citi|zens may be lo&s;t, for one of which I can &s;ee no rea&s;on; it is naturalization in a fo|reign country. This is &s;o manife&s;tly illi|beral and unju&s;t, that I am almo&s;t &s;ure it will be altered. It is an old feudal idea of allegiance; and goes upon the &s;uppo&s;ition that fidelity to one country is incompatible with our duty to another. When a citi|zen of one &s;tate is complimented with the
<PB N="37" REF="025143_0036_0FCE6C2143FFCDC0">
freedom of another, it is generally an ac|knowledgment of his merit; but your con&s;tituting a&s;&s;embly con&s;idered it as an object of puni&s;hment. Many of your citi|zens have been naturalized in America; but the American governments certainly did not fore&s;ee that this act of theirs would di&s;|franchi&s;e tho&s;e gentlemen at home. You have lately conferred the rights of a French citizen on George Wa&s;hington. If he &s;hould accept the honour you have thus done him, and the American con&s;titution were in this re&s;pect the &s;ame as your own, he mu&s;t immediately be turned out of office, and for ever disfranchi&s;ed at home.</P>
<P><HI>Fourth,</HI> You will doubtle&s;s con&s;ider the important &s;ubject of the <HI>frequency of popu|lar elections,</HI> as claiming a farther delibera|tion. It is an article on which too much reflection cannot be be&s;towed. It influ|ences the habits of the people and the &s;pirit of the government in a variety of ways, that e&s;cape our common ob&s;erva|tion. I mentioned before, that one of the fir&s;t objects of &s;ociety is to render every
<PB N="38" REF="025143_0037_0FCE6C227A600BC8">
individual perfectly dependent on the whole community. The more completely this object is attained, the more perfect will be the equality of enjoyments and the happi|ne&s;s of the &s;tate. But of all individuals, tho&s;e who are &s;elected to be the organs of the people, in making and in executing the laws, &s;hould feel this dependence in the &s;tronge&s;t degree. The ea&s;ie&s;t and mo&s;t natural method of effecting this purpo&s;e is, to oblige them to recur frequently to the authors of their official exi&s;tence, to depo&s;it their powers, mingle with their fellows, and wait the deci&s;ion of the &s;ame &s;overeign will which created them at fir&s;t, to know whether they are again to be tru&s;ted.</P>
<P>There are doubtle&s;s &s;ome limits to this frequency of election, beyond which it would be hurtful to pa&s;s; as every &s;ubject has a medium between two vitious ex|tremes. But I know of no office, in any department of &s;tate, that need to be held for more than one year, without a new election. Mo&s;t men, who give in to this
<PB N="39" REF="025143_0038_0FCE6C26E2E4C510">
idea with re&s;pect to the legi&s;lative, are ac|cu&s;tomed to make an exception with re|gard to the executive, and particularly with regard to that part which is called the judiciary. I am aware of all the argu|ments that are u&s;ually brought in &s;upport of the&s;e exceptions; but they appear to me of little weight, in compari&s;on to tho&s;e in favour of univer&s;al annual elections. Power always was, and always mu&s;t be, a danger|ous thing. I mean, power collected from the great ma&s;s of &s;ociety, and delegated to a few hands; for it is only in this &s;en&s;e that it can properly be called power. The phy&s;ical forces of all the individuals of a great nation cannot be brought to act at once upon a &s;ingle object; and the &s;ame may be &s;aid of their moral forces. It is nece&s;&s;ary therefore that the exerci&s;e of the&s;e &s;hould always be performed by dele|gation; the moral in legi&s;lation, the phy|&s;ical in execution. This is the proper definition of national power; and in this &s;en&s;e it is nece&s;&s;arily dangerous; becau&s;e, &s;trictly &s;peaking, it is not exerci&s;ed by tho&s;e who&s;e property it is, and for who&s;e
<PB N="40" REF="025143_0039_0FCE6C27CCA45BD0">
good it is intended to operate. It is in the nature of this kind of tru&s;t to invert in &s;ome mea&s;ure the order of things; it ap|parently &s;ets the &s;ervant above the ma&s;ter, and di&s;po&s;es him to feel a kind of inde|pendence which ought never to be felt by any citizen, particularly one who is charged with a public function.</P>
<P>It has ever been the tendency of govern|ment to divide the &s;ociety into two par|ties,&mdash;the governors and the governed. The mi&s;chiefs ari&s;ing from this are almo&s;t infinite. It not only di&s;po&s;es each party to view the other with an eye of jealou&s;y and di&s;tru&s;t, which &s;oon ri&s;e to acts of &s;e|cret or open enmity, but it effectually cor|rupts the morals of both parties, and de|&s;troys the vital principles of &s;ociety; it makes government the trade of the few, &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion the drudgery of the many, and fal&s;ehood the common artifice of the whole. To prevent this, I would have no man placed in a po&s;ition in which he can call him&s;elf governor, for a moment longer than while he performs the duties of his tru&s;t
<PB N="41" REF="025143_0040_0FCE6C2937093008">
to the &s;atisfaction of his fellow citizens, nor even then, but for a &s;hort period. He &s;hould feel at all times as though he were &s;oon to change places with any one of his neighbours, whom he now &s;ees &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive to his authority.</P>
<P>But to an&s;wer this purpo&s;e, the fre|quent return of elections is not of it&s;elf &s;ufficient. I am fully of the opinion, that with regard to all di&s;cretionary officers, there ought to be an exclu&s;ion by rota|tion. Tho&s;e functions that are purely mini&s;terial, &s;uch as tho&s;e of &s;heriffs, con|&s;tables, clerks of courts, regi&s;ters, &amp;c. per|haps may form exceptions; but legi&s;lators, executive coun&s;ellors, judges and magi&s;|trates of every de&s;cription, &s;hould not only feel their dependence on the people by an annual election, but &s;hould frequently mingle with them by an exclu&s;ion from office. The effect of this would be, not what is often a&s;&s;erted, that no one would under&s;tand government, but the contrary, that every one would under&s;tand it. This would form a prodigious &s;timulus to the
<PB N="42" REF="025143_0041_0FCE6C2AD6FB77F8">
acqui&s;ition of knowledge among all de|&s;criptions of men, in all parts of the country. Every man of ordinary ability would be not only capable of watching over his own rights, but of exerci&s;ing any of the functions by which the public &s;afe|ty is &s;ecured. For whatever there is in the art of government, whether legi&s;lative or executive, above the capacity of the or|dinary cla&s;s of what are called well in|formed men, is &s;uperfluous and de&s;tructive, and ought to be laid a&s;ide. The man who is called a <HI>politician,</HI> according to the prac|tical &s;en&s;e of the word in modern Europe, exerci&s;es an office infinitely more de&s;truc|tive to &s;ociety than that of a highwayman. The &s;ame may be &s;aid, in general, of the <HI>financier</HI>; who&s;e art and my&s;tery, on the funding &s;y&s;tem of the pre&s;ent century, con|&s;i&s;t in making calculations to enable go|vernments to hire mankind to butcher each other, by drawing bills on po&s;terity for the payment.</P>
<P>I would therefore &s;ugge&s;t the propriety of your reviewing the article of biennial
<PB N="43" REF="025143_0042_0FCE6C2C32C66DA8">
elections, as in&s;tituted by your fir&s;t a&s;&s;em|bly, and of your making them annual; and the &s;ame term, if not the &s;ame manner of election, ought to extend to all executive officers, who&s;e functions are in any man|ner di&s;cretionary. I think it would like|wi&s;e be e&s;&s;ential, that no office of this de&s;|cription &s;hould be held by one man, more than two years in any term of four years. This would &s;end into the departments, and into every part of the empire, at frequent periods, &s;ome thou&s;ands of men with prac|tical knowledge of public bu&s;ine&s;s; it would at lea&s;t be the means of doubling the number of &s;uch well-in&s;tructed men; and, by holding out the inducement to others, to qualify them&s;elves to merit the confidence of their fellow citizens, it would multiply the number of men of theoretical knowledge, at lea&s;t ten fold. All the&s;e men will be watchful guardians of the public &s;afety. But the&s;e are not all the advantages of frequent elections.

labour; they habituate the candidates to be gratified with the public confidence, or to be di&s;appointed in the expectation of ob|taining it; &s;o that their &s;ucce&s;s or di&s;ap|pointment cea&s;es to make that deep im|pre&s;&s;ion on their minds, which it otherwi&s;e would do. It is thus that you would cut off an infinite &s;ource of that intrigue and cor|ruption, which are foretold with &s;o much horror by tho&s;e who have not well &s;tudied the effects of a well organized popular government. But another method, not le&s;s effectual, to prevent the arts of &s;crambling for power and places, will be hinted at in the following article.</P>
<P><HI>Fifth,</HI> Among the fatal mi&s;conceptions of things which monarchy has entailed upon us, and which are extremely difficult to eradicate from the mind, mu&s;t be reckoned that prevalent opinion, that all govern|ments &s;hould gratify their agents with <HI>enormous &s;alaries.</HI> This idea has u&s;ually been more particularly applied in favour of the executive officers of government and their dependants; and it had its origin in
<PB N="45" REF="025143_0044_0FCE6C30A5164B10">
the antecedent principle, that government divides the people into two di&s;tinct cla&s;&s;es, and that the &s;ame quantity of bu&s;ine&s;s, coming within the verge of one of the&s;e cla&s;&s;es, mu&s;t be paid for at a higher price than it would be, within that of the other; though it &s;hould be performed by the &s;ame man, and required the &s;ame exertion of talents. Your con&s;titution is &s;ilent as to the quantity of &s;alary that &s;hall be paid to any particular officer; it only &s;ays, that <Q>the nation will provide for the &s;plendour of the throne</Q> (which indeed is a decla|ration of war again&s;t the liberties of the people) but the authors of that con&s;titution, in their legi&s;lative capacity, after providing for that &s;plendour with a &s;um &s;ufficient to purcha&s;e the majority of almo&s;t any corps of &s;even hundred legi&s;lators, went on to provide for the &s;plendour of the mini&s;ters. They gave to one, if my memory does not deceive me, one hundred and fifty thou&s;and livres, and one hundred thou&s;and to each of the re&s;t. This on an average is about three times more than ought to have been
<PB N="46" REF="025143_0045_0FCE6C31754081E0">
given, unle&s;s the object were to carry on the government by intriguing for places.</P>
<P>I mention this article, not on the &s;core of oeconomy. That con&s;ideration, how|ever weighty it may appear, is one of the lea&s;t that can &s;trike the mind on the &s;ubject of public &s;alaries. The evil of paying too much is pregnant with a thou&s;and mi&s;|chiefs. It is almo&s;t &s;ufficient of it&s;elf to defeat all the advantages to be expected from the in&s;titution of an equal govern|ment. The general rule to be adopted in this ca&s;e (which perhaps is all that can be &s;aid of it in the con&s;titution) appears to me to be this, <HI>That &s;o much, and no more, &s;hall be given for the performance of any public function, as &s;hall be &s;ufficient to in|duce &s;uch men to undertake it who&s;e abilities are equal to the ta&s;k.</HI> If this rule were &s;trictly ob&s;erved, it is rational to conclude, that there would be no more contention or intrigue among candidates to obtain places in the government, than there is among manufacturers, to find a market
<PB N="47" REF="025143_0046_0FCE6C34658A0BE0">
for their goods. This conclu&s;ion becomes more probably ju&s;t, when we con&s;ider that your intention is to cut off from the &s;er|vants of the public all hopes of obtaining the public money by any indirect and frau|dulent mea&s;ures. When there &s;hall be no more civil li&s;t, or livre rouge, no more mini&s;terial patronage in church or &s;tate, no more &s;ale of ju&s;tice or purcha&s;e of op|pre&s;&s;ion, or any kind of perqui&s;ite of office, but the candidate &s;hall be a&s;&s;ured, that all the money he &s;hall receive, will be the &s;imple &s;um promi&s;ed by the legi&s;lature, that &s;um being no more than the work is hone&s;tly worth, he will accept or relin|qui&s;h the mo&s;t important tru&s;t, as he would an ordinary occupation.</P>
<P>This &s;ingle circum&s;tance of &s;alaries, be|ing wi&s;ely guarded on every &s;ide, would, in the cour&s;e of its operation, almo&s;t change the moral face of government. It would &s;ilence all the clamours again&s;t the republican principle, and an&s;wer many of the fa&s;hionable calumnies again&s;t the cha|racter of the human heart.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="025143_0047_0FCE6C3602467D30">There is another que&s;tionable opinion now extant, even in republican countries; which, as it has made &s;ome figure in France, and is connected with the &s;ubject of &s;alaries, I will mention in this place. It is &s;uppo&s;ed to be nece&s;&s;ary, for the ener|gy of government, that its officers &s;hould a&s;&s;ume a kind of external pomp and &s;plen|dour, in order to dazzle the eye, and in|&s;pire the public mind with a veneration for their authority. As this pomp cannot be &s;upported without &s;ome expence, the &s;up|po&s;ed nece&s;&s;ity for a&s;&s;uming it is always of|fered as a rea&s;on for high &s;alaries; and, allowing the fir&s;t po&s;ition to be true, the con&s;equence is certainly rea&s;onable and ju&s;t. If we are to be governed only by deception, it is right that we &s;hould pay for this deception. But the whole argu|ment is wrong; that is, if we allow mo|narchy and hierarchy to be wrong; it is a badge of that kind of government which is directly the rever&s;e of republican principles, or the government of rea&s;on. I do not deny, that this official pomp has in a great mea&s;ure the effect which is intended from
<PB N="49" REF="025143_0048_0FCE6C38323A94E0">
it; it impo&s;es on the unthinking part of mankind, and has a tendency to &s;ecure their obedience. This effect, however, is not &s;o great as that of &s;implicity, and the native dignity of rea&s;on would be; but on the moral habits of &s;ociety, its operation is more pernicious than at fir&s;t view we are ready to imagine. So far as the people are caught by the impo&s;ition, it leads them to wrong ideas of them&s;elves, of their of|ficers, and of the real authority of laws. This is a fatal deviation from the true de|&s;ign of government; for its principal ob|ject certainly ought to be, to rectify our opinions, and improve our morals.</P>
<P>For my own part, when I &s;ee a man in private life a&s;&s;uming an external &s;plendour, for the &s;ake of gaining attention, I cannot but feel it an in&s;ult offered to my under|&s;tanding; becau&s;e it is &s;aying to me, that I have not di&s;cernment enough to di&s;tin|gui&s;h his merit, without this kind of <HI>ecce &s;ignum.</HI> And when an officer of govern|ment exhibits him&s;elf in the foppery of a puppet, and is drawn by &s;ix or eight
<PB N="50" REF="025143_0049_0FCE6C3C67B42770">
hor&s;es, where two would be really more convenient to hir &s;elf, I am grieved at the in&s;ult offered to the nation, and at their &s;tupidity in not perceiving it. For the language of the mummery is &s;imply this, That the officer cannot rely upon his own per&s;onal dignity as a title to re&s;pect, nor the laws be tru&s;ted to their own ju&s;tice, to in&s;ure their execution. It is a full ac|knowledgment on his part, that the go|vernment is bad, and that he is obliged to dazzle the eyes of the people, to prevent their di&s;covering the cheat. When a &s;et of judges on the bench take the pains to &s;hroud their head and &s;houlders in a fleece of hor&s;e-hair, in order to re&s;emble the bird of wi&s;dom, it rai&s;es a &s;trong &s;u&s;picion, that they mean to palm upon us the emblem for the reality.</P>
<P>It is e&s;&s;ential to the character of a free republic, that every thing &s;hould be re|duced to the &s;tandard of rea&s;on; that men and laws &s;hould depend on their own in|trin&s;ic merit, and that no &s;hadow of decep|tion &s;hould ever be offered to the people;
<PB N="51" REF="025143_0050_0FCE6C3D806D3508">
as it cannot fail to corrupt them; and pave the way to oppre&s;&s;ion. I make the&s;e re|marks, not that they will form an article proper to enter into your con&s;titution, but to remove every appearance of argument in favour of high &s;alaries. And I think the con&s;titution ought to contain a general declaration, <HI>that every public &s;alary &s;hould be re&s;tricted to a &s;um not more than &s;ufficient to reward the officer for his labour;</HI> which &s;um mu&s;t, of cour&s;e, be left to be fixed by the legi&s;lature.</P>
<P><HI>Seventh,</HI> There appears to me to be an error of doctrine in France, with re&s;pect to the relation which ought to &s;ub&s;i&s;t be|tween the repre&s;entative, and his imme|diate con&s;tituents. It is &s;aid, that when a repre&s;entative is once cho&s;en, and &s;ent to the A&s;&s;embly, he is no longer to be con&s;i|dered as repre&s;enting the people of the particular department which &s;ent him, but of the nation at large; and therefore, dur|ing the term for which he is cho&s;en, he is not accountable to the people who cho&s;e him, but is to be controuled, removed or
<PB N="52" REF="025143_0051_0FCE6C3FB3EC7B00">
&s;u&s;pended, only by the National A&s;&s;embly. This appears to have been e&s;tabli&s;hed, in order to get rid of a contrary doctrine, which was found to be inconvenient; which was, that a delegate &s;hould be bound at all times to follow the <HI>in&s;tructions</HI> of his con&s;tituents; as thereby all the ad|vantages to be expected from di&s;cu&s;&s;ion and deliberation would be lo&s;t. If the fir&s;t of the&s;e be an error, as I believe it is, it may ea&s;ily be avoided, without running into the la&s;t. When the delegate receives in&s;tructions, which prove to be contrary to the opinion which he afterwards forms, he ought to pre&s;ume that his con&s;tituents, not having had the advantage of hearing the national di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, are not well in|formed on the &s;ubject, and his duty is to vote according to his con&s;cience. It is to be &s;uppo&s;ed that, for his own &s;ake, he will explain to them his motives; but if for this, or any other circum&s;tance, they &s;hould be di&s;&s;atisfied with his conduct, they have an undoubted right at any time to recall him, and nominate another in his place. This will tend to maintain a proper relation be|tween
<PB N="53" REF="025143_0052_0FCE6C43812D0298">
the repre&s;entative and the people, and a due dependence of the former upon the latter. Be&s;ides, when a man has lo&s;t the confidence of his fellow-citizens of the department, he is no longer their repre|&s;entative; and when he cea&s;es to be theirs, he cannot in any &s;en&s;e be the repre&s;enta|tive of the nation; &s;ince it is not pretended that he can derive any authority, but through his own con&s;tituents. This, however, cannot deprive the a&s;&s;embly of its right to expel or &s;uspend a member for any refrac|tory conduct, which may be deemed an offence again&s;t the &s;tate.</P>
<P><HI>Eighth,</HI> The article of <HI>inviolability,</HI> as applied to the members of the a&s;&s;embly, or to any other officers of the &s;tate, is worthy of re-con&s;ideration. But before it be again decided in the affirmative, you ought to take a general view of that intere&s;ting &s;ub|ject of <HI>impri&s;onment for debt.</HI> It is a &s;pe|cies of civil cruelty which all modern go|vernments have borrowed from the Roman law, which con&s;idered a debtor as a crimi|nal, and committed the care of his puni&s;h|ment
<PB N="54" REF="025143_0053_0FCE6C44F28C46F0">
into the hands of the creditor, lend|ing the public pri&s;on as an in&s;trument of private vengeance. It is a di&s;grace to the wi&s;dom of a nation, and can never be allowed in a well regulated &s;tate. If no citizen could be arre&s;ted or deprived of his liberty, for debt, there would be no need of making an exception in favour of the offi|cers of government; and thus you would remove a di&s;tinction which mu&s;t always appear unju&s;t.</P>
<P><HI>Ninth,</HI> You will &s;carcely think that your duty is di&s;charged, &s;o as to &s;atisfy your own minds on the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a con|&s;titution, from which the friends of hu|manity will anticipate a total regeneration of &s;ociety, until you &s;hall have given a far|ther declaration on the &s;ubject of criminal law. All men of reflection are agreed, that puni&s;hments in modern times have lo&s;t all proportion to the crimes to which they are annexed, even on that &s;cale of barbarous ju&s;tice by which they were in|troduced. Few, however, have had the wi&s;dom to di&s;cover, or the boldne&s;s to de|clare,
<PB N="55" REF="025143_0054_0FCE6C478EAF52B8">
the true cau&s;e of the evil; and while we remain ignorant of the cau&s;e, it is no wonder that we fail in finding the remedy. In the glooms of meditation on the mi&s;e|ries of civilized life, I have been almo&s;t led to adopt this conclu&s;ion, That &s;ociety it&s;elf is the cau&s;e of all crimes; and, as &s;uch, it has no right to puni&s;h them at all. But, without indulging the &s;everity of this un|qualified a&s;&s;ertion, we way venture to &s;ay, that every puni&s;hment is a new crime; though it may not in all ca&s;es be &s;o great as would follow from omitting to puni&s;h.</P>
<P>There is a manife&s;t difference between <HI>puni&s;hment</HI> and <HI>correction;</HI> the latter, among rational beings, may always be performed by in&s;truction; or at mo&s;t by &s;ome gentle &s;pecies of re&s;traint. But puni&s;hment, on the part of the public, ari&s;es from no other &s;ource but a jealou&s;y of power. It is a confe&s;&s;ion of the inability of &s;ociety, to protect it&s;elf again&s;t an ignorant or refrac|tory member. When there are factions in a &s;tate, contending for the &s;upreme command, the pains inflicted by each party
<PB N="56" REF="025143_0055_0FCE6C4A8A956D48">
are &s;ummary; they often precede the crime&punc; and the factions wreak their vengeance on each other, as a prevention of expected injuries. Something very &s;imilar to this is what perpetually takes place in every na|tion, in what is called a &s;tate of tranquil|lity and order. For government has u&s;u|ally been nothing more than a regulated faction. The party which governs and the party which reluctantly &s;ubmits to be governed, maintain a continual conflict; and out of that conflict proceed the crimes and the puni&s;hments, or, more properly &s;peaking, the puni&s;hments and the crimes. When we &s;ee the power of the nation &s;eizing an individual, dragging him to a tribunal, pronouncing him worthy of death, and then going through the &s;olemn formalities of execution, it is natural to a&s;k, what is the meaning of all this? It certainly means, that the nation is in a &s;tate of civil war; and even in that barbarous &s;tage of war, when it is thought nece&s;&s;ary to put all pri|&s;oners to death. In deciding the que&s;tion, whether a particular criminal &s;hould be put to death, I never would a&s;k what is the
<PB N="57" REF="025143_0056_0FCE6C4C1B3ABFB8">
nature of his offence; it has nothing to do with the que&s;tion; I would &s;imply enquire, what is the condition of the &s;ociety. If it be in a &s;tate of internal peace, I would &s;ay it was wicked and ab&s;urd to think of inflicting &s;uch puni&s;hment. To plead that there is a nece&s;&s;ity for that de&s;perate remedy, proves a want of energy in the government, or of wi&s;dom in the nation.</P>
<P>When men are in a &s;tate of war, with the enemy's bayonets pointed at their brea&s;ts, or when they are in the heat of a revolution, encompa&s;&s;ed by trea&s;on, and tormented by corruption, there is an apo|logy for human &s;laughter; but when you have e&s;tabli&s;hed a wi&s;e and manly govern|ment, founded on the moral &s;en&s;e, and invigorated by the enlightened rea&s;on of the people, let it not be &s;ullied by that timid vengeance, which belongs only to tyrants and u&s;urpers. I could wi&s;h that your con&s;titution might declare, not merely what it has already declared, that the penal code &s;hall be reformed, but, that within a certain period after the return of peace,
<PB N="58" REF="025143_0057_0FCE6C4D5BD9E5E8">
<HI>the puni&s;hment of death &s;hall be aboli&s;hed.</HI> It ought likewi&s;e to enjoin it on the legi&s;|lative body to &s;often the rigour of puni&s;h|ments in general, until they &s;hall amount to little more than a tender paternal correc|tion. Whoever will look into the human heart, and examine the order of nature in &s;ociety, mu&s;t be convinced, that this is the mo&s;t likely method of preventing the com|mi&s;&s;ion of crimes. But</P>
<P><HI>Tenth,</HI> In order to be con&s;i&s;tent with your&s;elves in removing tho&s;e abu&s;es which have laid the foundation of all offences again&s;t &s;ociety, both in crimes and puni&s;h|ments, you ought to pay a farther attention to the nece&s;&s;ity of <HI>public in&s;truction.</HI> It is your duty, as a con&s;tituting a&s;&s;embly, to e&s;tabli&s;h a &s;y&s;tem of government that &s;hall improve the morals of mankind. In rai&s;ing a people from &s;lavery to freedom, you have called them to act on a new theatre; and it is a nece&s;&s;ary part of your bu&s;ine&s;s, to teach them how to per|form their parts. By di&s;covering to a man his rights, you impo&s;e upon him a new
<PB N="59" REF="025143_0058_0FCE6C4EB1B098A8">
&s;y&s;tem of duties. Every Frenchman, born to liberty, mu&s;t now claim, among the fir&s;t of his rights, the right of being in&s;tructed in the manner of pre&s;erving them. This the &s;ociety has no authority to refu&s;e; and to fail of enjoining it on the legi&s;lative body, as a part of its con&s;tant care, would be to counteract the principles of the revo|lution, and expo&s;e the whole &s;y&s;tem to be overturned.</P>
<P>From what the con&s;titution has already declared on this head, and from the di&s;po|&s;ition of the two la&s;t a&s;&s;emblies, I have no doubt but con&s;iderable attention will be paid to it; but I wi&s;h in this place to re|commend it to a more particular con&s;ider|ation, as a &s;ubject connected with criminal law. It is certain that no obedience can be rationally expected from any man to a law which he does not know. It is not only unju&s;t, but ab&s;urd and even impo&s;&s;i|ble, to enforce his obedience. It is there|fore but half the bu&s;ine&s;s of legi&s;lators to make good laws; an indi&s;pen&s;able part of their duty is to &s;ee that every per&s;on in
<PB N="60" REF="025143_0059_0FCE6C5191647038">
the &s;tate &s;hall perfectly under&s;tand them. The barbarous maxim of juri&s;prudence, <HI>That ignorance of the law is no excu&s;e to the offender,</HI> is an in&s;olent apology for tyranny, and ought never to di&s;grace the policy of a rational government. I think therefore it would do honor to your con&s;titution, and &s;erve as a &s;timulus to your legi&s;lature and to your magi&s;trates, in the great duty of in&s;truction, to declare, <HI>That knowledge is the foundation of obedience, and that laws &s;hall have no authority but where they are under&s;tood.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Eleventh,</HI> Since I am treating of mo|rals, the great object of all politic I in&s;ti|tutions, I cannot avoid be&s;towing &s;ome remarks on the &s;ubject of <HI>public lotteries.</HI> It is a &s;hocking di&s;grace to modern govern|ments, that they are driven to this pitiful piece of knavery, to draw money from the people. But no circum&s;tance of this kind is &s;o extraordinary, as that this policy &s;hould be continued in France, &s;ince the revolution; and that a &s;tate lottery &s;hould &s;till be reckoned among the permanent

&s;ources of revenue. It has its origin in deception; and depends for its &s;upport, on rai&s;ing and di&s;appointing the hopes of in|dividuals, on perpetually agitating the mind with unrea&s;onable de&s;ires of gain, on cloud|ing the under&s;tanding with &s;uper&s;titious ideas of chance, de&s;tiny, and fate, on divert|ing the attention from regular indu&s;try, and promoting a univer&s;al &s;pirit of gambling, which carries all &s;orts of vices into all cla&s;&s;es of people. Whatever way we look into human affairs, we &s;hall ever find, that the bad organization of &s;ociety is the cau&s;e of more di&s;orders than could po&s;&s;ibly ari&s;e from the natural temper of the heart. And what &s;hall we &s;ay of a government, that avowedly &s;teps forward with the in&s;olence of an open enemy, and creates a new vice, for the &s;ake of loading it with a tax? What right has &s;uch a government to puni&s;h our follies? And who can look without di&s;gu&s;t on the impious figure it makes, in holding the &s;courge in one hand, and the tempta|tion in the other?

The experience of mankind has not yet enabled us even to &s;uppo&s;e a ca&s;e, in which it would be other|wi&s;e.

<P>I cannot but think it unnece&s;&s;ary, if not impertinent, to enter into farther ar|guments to prove, that ju&s;tice, policy, and the true principles of commerce, re|quire you to &s;et the example to the world, of declaring your colonies ab&s;olutely free and independent &s;tates, and of inviting
<PB N="65" REF="025143_0064_0FCE6C5EDA344C38">
them to form a government of their own. The example would &s;oon be followed by other nations; if not from rea&s;on and from choice, at lea&s;t from the more imperious argument of nece&s;&s;ity.</P>
<P><HI>Thirteenth,</HI> I cannot clo&s;e my letter, without &s;ome reflections on the policy of maintaining any thing like what is called <HI>a &s;tanding army in time of peace,</HI> which &s;eems to have been the intention of your fir&s;t A&s;&s;embly. Such a force would have many fatal effects on the &s;pirit of a repub|lican government, without an&s;wering any good purpo&s;e that can be expected from it. According to your own principles, you will have no more to do with foreign wars, unle&s;s you are invaded; and it is probable, that the pre&s;ent is the la&s;t inva|&s;ion that will ever be formed again&s;t France. But, be that as it may, a &s;tand|ing military force is the wor&s;t re&s;ource that can be found for the defence of a free re|public. In this ca&s;e, the &s;trength of the army is the weakne&s;s of the nation. If
<PB N="66" REF="025143_0065_0FCE6C5FF245FEC0">
the army be really &s;trong enough to be re|lied on for defence, it not only impo&s;es on the people a va&s;t unnece&s;&s;ary expence, but it mu&s;t be a dangerous in&s;trument, in the hands of dangerous men; it may furni&s;h the means of civil wars, and of the de&s;truc|tion of liberty. If, on the contrary&punc; it be not &s;ufficient for external defence, it will only &s;erve to di&s;appoint the people. Be|ing taught to believe that they have an army, they will cea&s;e to tru&s;t in their own &s;trength, and be deceived in their expecta|tions of &s;afety.</P>
<P>But the greate&s;t objection again&s;t a &s;tanding army is, the effect it would have on the political &s;entiments of the people. Every citizen ought to feel him&s;elf to be a nece&s;&s;ary part of the great community, for every purpo&s;e to which the public in|tere&s;t can call him to act; he &s;hould feel the habits of a citizen and the energies of a &s;oldier, without being exclu&s;ively de&s;tined to the functions of either. His phy&s;ical and moral powers &s;hould be kept in equal
<PB N="67" REF="025143_0066_0FCE6C64BA5E8CF8">
vigour; as the di&s;u&s;e of the former would be very &s;oon followed by the decay of the la|ter. If it be wrong to tru&s;t the legi&s;lative power of the &s;tate for a number of years, or for life, to a &s;mall number of men; it is certainly more prepo&s;terous to do the &s;ame thing with regard to military power. Where the wi&s;dom re&s;ides, there ought the &s;trength to re&s;ide, in the great body of the people; and neither the one nor the other ought ever to be delegated, but for &s;hort periods of time, and under &s;evere re&s;tric|tions. This is the way to pre&s;erve a tem|perate and manly u&s;e of both; and thus, by tru&s;ting only to them&s;elves, the people will be &s;ure of a perpetual defence again&s;t the open force, and the &s;ecret intrigues of all po&s;&s;ible enemies at home and abroad.</P>
<P><HI>Fourteenth,</HI> After tracing the outlines of your con&s;titution, according to your pre&s;ent ideas, and proclaiming it in the mo&s;t &s;olemn manner, as the foundation of law and right, it will &s;till be vain to think of re&s;training the people from making al|terations
<PB N="68" REF="025143_0067_0FCE6C662EDABC58">
and amendments, as often as ex|perience &s;hall induce them to change their opinions. The point you have to aim at in this, is to agree upon a method in which amendments can be made, without any of tho&s;e extraordinary exertions, which would occa&s;ion unnece&s;&s;ary in&s;urrections. The more ea&s;y and expeditious this method &s;hall appear, the le&s;s likely it will be to provoke di&s;orders, and the better it will an&s;wer the purpo&s;e, provided it always re|fers the &s;ubject to the real wi&s;hes of the people. I would propo&s;e, therefore (on the pre&s;umption that your legi&s;lative body &s;hall be cho&s;en only for one year at a time) that every annual National A&s;&s;embly &s;hall have power to propo&s;e, and the next &s;uc|ceeding one to adopt and ratify, any amend|ments that they &s;hall think proper in the con&s;titutional code. But it &s;hould always be done under this re&s;triction, that the ar|ticles to be propo&s;ed by any one A&s;&s;embly, &s;hould be agreed to, and publi&s;hed to the people in every department, within the fir&s;t &s;ix months of the &s;e&s;&s;ions of that
<PB N="69" REF="025143_0068_0FCE6C6772798240">
A&s;&s;embly. This would give time to the people to di&s;cu&s;s the &s;ubject fully, and to form their opinions, previous to the time of electing their members to the next A&s;&s;embly. The members of the new A&s;&s;embly, when they &s;hould come toge|ther, would thus be competent to declare the wi&s;hes of the people on the amend|ments propo&s;ed, and would act upon them as they &s;hould think proper. The &s;ame power of propo&s;ing and adopting would be continued from year to year with per|fect &s;afety to the con&s;titution, and with the probability of improvement.</P>
<P>Thus, gentlemen, I have given a ha&s;ty &s;ketch of &s;ome leading ideas, that lay with weight upon my mind, on a &s;ubject of much importance to the intere&s;ts of a con|&s;iderable portion of the human race. If they &s;hould be thought of no value, they will of cour&s;e occupy but little of your at|tention, and therefore can do no injury. If I have &s;aid any thing from which a u&s;e|ful reflection &s;hall be drawn, I &s;hall feel
