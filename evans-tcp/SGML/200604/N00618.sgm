<P>WHen the <HI>Lawes</HI> of Heaven were given to <HI>Israel,</HI> by the Hand of <HI>Moses,</HI> 'tis Observable, that the first of the <HI>Judgments then set before them,</HI> was about <HI>Servants:</HI> They had been <HI>Servants</HI> themselves; &amp; it was very proper to Begin with such things as might mind them <HI>of</HI> their late Condition, &amp; such things whe<HI>r</HI>e of they might be further mind|ed <HI>in</HI> their late Condition. Their Father <HI>Ja|cob,</HI> also had been hardly used as a <HI>Servant,</HI> for whole <HI>Sevens</HI> of Years, &amp; in some Remem|brance of it, the Lord begins His <HI>Laws</HI> with Prohibiting the Children of <HI>Jocob,</HI> to make one of their Nation a <HI>Servant</HI> more than <HI>Six.</HI></P>
<P>Reader, I have Considered, that the Second Edition of the <HI>Law,</HI> in the New Testament likewise, made no little mention of what be|longs unto a <HI>Good Servant:</HI> and I have Con|sidered the many Complaints which Fami|lies in all places made, of their wanting such a <HI>Blessing.</HI> That I might in this matter, be a <HI>Servant</HI> unto the Lord Jesus Christ, and the Souls of my Neighbours, both the <HI>Bond,</HI> &amp; the <HI>Free,</HI> in Him, the following <HI>Essay,</HI> just as it was uttered unto my own Congrega|tion, is here Exposed.</P>

<BIBL>It is also Written, in 1 Tim. VI. 1, 2.</BIBL>
<Q><P><HI>Let as many Servants as are under the yoke, count their own Masters worthy of all honour: that th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> Name of God, and his Doctrine be not blasphemed.</HI></P>
<P><HI>And they that have believing Masters, let them no despise them, because they are brethren: but rather do them Service, because they are faithful, and beloved, partakers of the benefit. These thing teach and exhort.</HI></P></Q>
<BIBL>It is again Written, in Eph. VI. 5, 6, 7, 8.</BIBL>
<Q><P><HI>Servants be obedient to them that are your Master according to the flesh, with fear and trembling in singleness of your heart, as unto Christ.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Knowing that whatsoever good thing any man doeth, the same shall he receive of the Lord, whether he be bond or free.</HI></P></Q>
<BIBL>It is likewise Written, in Col. III. 22, 23, 24, 25.</BIBL>
<Q><P><HI>Servants obey in all things your masters according to the flesh; not with eye service, as men pleasers, but in singleness of heart, fearing God.</HI></P>
<P><HI>And whatsoever ye do, do it heartily, as to the Lord, and not unto men.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Knowing that of the Lord ye shall receive the reward of the inheritance: for ye serve the Lord Christ.</HI></P>
<P><HI>But he that doeth wrong, shall receive for the wrong which he hath done: and there is no respect of persons.</HI></P></Q>
<BIBL>It was afterwards Written, in 1 Pet. II. 18.</BIBL>

<HI>Nature,</HI> hath <HI>Positive Rules</HI> given by our God in His Word, for the Regulation of it.</P>
<P>The <HI>First Society,</HI> which Mankind falls, and indeed <HI>Naturally</HI> falls into, is <HI>Domestical;</HI> the <HI>So|ciety,</HI> that makes a family.

<P>When the Providence of God, hath brought a person, into any sort of <HI>Humane Society,</HI> it is not the least Office of Religion to direct, and assist, the person, in the Discharge of the Rela|tion, which he bears to that Society. The true <HI>Religion,</HI> having a due <HI>Impression</HI> upon us, will vastly amend us, and improve us, in every <HI>Rela|tion,</HI> wherein the Providence of God hath pla|ced us.

We find therefore that the <HI>Scriptures</HI> of God often and largely insist on the Duties of men, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> those Relative Capacities, wherein they stand obliged unto one another.

For this Cause, the Apostles, do very emphatically De|monstrate it, that <HI>Christianity</HI> will Teach persons to be better <HI>Masters,</HI> and better <HI>Servants,</HI> than ever they were before.</P>

There is this Lesson divers times in the Bible given you, <HI>Know that you have a Master in Heaven.</HI> I say then, Learn this Lesson; and let every <HI>Master</HI> say, <HI>The Lord of Heaven shall be my Master.</HI> I remember the Servant of <HI>Abraham</HI> seem'd, as it were to value himself, upon the score of his having such a <HI>Master;</HI> said he, in Gen. 24. 34. <HI>I am Abra|hams Servant.</HI> Indeed, a <HI>Master</HI> that shall be like <HI>Abraham,</HI> an Exemplary Believer, and a Re|ligious Housholder, will give <HI>Servants</HI> cause to be ambitious of Living with him.

It is true, and, alas, that it is true! there is too much Scarcity of <HI>Godly Ser|vants,</HI> to afford a <HI>Choice,</HI> unto us all; but if we can't have <HI>Godly Servants,</HI> yet let it not be our <HI>Choice,</HI> to have <HI>Servants,</HI> that shall be noted for any visible and notorious <HI>Ungodliness;</HI> you had better take a <HI>Serpent</HI> into your Houses, than a Profane, Swearing, Cursing, Drinking, Wanton, Thievish, Lying, Child of the <HI>Old Serpent.</HI> There are many little Ingenuities, which are used by men, for the <HI>Trials</HI> of their <HI>Servants,</HI> before they have them; the <HI>Trials</HI> of their Ca|pacity, their Sedulit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">y, their Fidelity; but let your main Trials for your <HI>Servants</HI> be, Whether they can say, as he, in 1 King. 18. 12. <HI>I thy Ser|vant fear the Lord from my Youth.</HI> Now, a good <HI>Report,</HI> of them, is therefore to be sought for An <HI>Onesimus,</HI> a <HI>Servant</HI> Born again, will be a <HI>profitable Servant.</HI></P>

<P>They <HI>Eat</HI> until they <HI>Sweat,</HI> and <HI>Work</HI> until they <HI>Freeze:</HI> But the <HI>Spirit</HI> of God, has, you see, passed this Judgment on them, <HI>The worst Meat they can Eat, is too good for them.</HI> Whereas there is a Notable <HI>Prophecy</HI> concerning the <HI>Dili|gent;</HI>
<PB N="42" REF="000754_0042_0FAA51266A87D140">
you have that <HI>Prophecy</HI> in the <HI>Proverbs of Israel;</HI> 'tis in Prov. 10. 4. <HI>The Hand of the Dili|gent makes Rich;</HI> 'tis in Prov. 12. 24. <HI>The Hand of the Diligent shall bear Rule;</HI> 'tis in Prov. 22. 29. <HI>Seest thou a man Diligent in his Business?

<P>But among many Instances of <HI>Diligence,</HI> which a <HI>Servant</HI> is to give, a more special one is, <HI>An Expedition in these Errands which</HI> he may be sent upon.
