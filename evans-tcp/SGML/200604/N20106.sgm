<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><HI>ACCORDING</HI> to the plea&s;ure of the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives, expre&s;&s;ed in their re&s;olution of February <HI>23, 1791,</HI> I now lay before them, a <HI>REPORT</HI> on the <HI>PRI|VILEGES</HI> and <HI>RESTRICTIONS</HI> on the <HI>COMMERCE</HI> of the United States in Foreign Countries. In order to keep the &s;ubject within tho&s;e bounds, which I &s;uppo&s;ed to be under the contemplation of the Hou&s;e, I have re&s;trained my &s;tatements to tho&s;e countries only, with which we carry on a commerce of &s;ome importance, and to tho&s;e articles al&s;o of our produce, which are of &s;en&s;ible weight in the &s;cale of our exports; and even the&s;e articles are &s;ometimes grouped together, accor|ding to the degree of favor or re&s;triction, with which they are received in each country, and that degree expre&s;&s;ed in general terms, without detailing the exact duty levied on each article.</P>
<P>To have gone fully into the&s;e minutiae, would have been to copy the tariffs and books of rates of the different countries, and to have hidden under a ma&s;s of detail, tho&s;e general and important truths, the extraction of which in a &s;imple form, I conceived, would be&s;t an&s;wer the enquiries of the Hou&s;e, by conden&s;ing material information within tho&s;e li|mits of time and attention, which this portion of their duties may ju&s;tly claim. The plan, indeed, of minute details, would have been impracticable with &s;ome countries, for want of information.</P>
<P>Since preparing this Report, which was put into its pre|&s;ent form, in time to have been given in to the la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion of Congre&s;s, alterations of the conditions of our commerce with &s;ome foreign nations have taken place, &s;ome of them inde|pendent of the war, &s;ome ari&s;ing out of it. France has
<PB N="iv" REF="026339_0003_0FCF9CEA1E3F6C68">
propo&s;ed to enter into a new treaty of commerce with us, on liberal principles; and has, in the mean time, relaxed &s;ome of the re&s;traints mentioned in the report.&mdash;Spain has, by an ordinance of June la&s;t, e&s;tabli&s;hed New-Orleans, Pen&s;acola, and Saint Augu&s;tine into free ports, for the ve&s;&s;els of friendly nations <HI>having treaties of commerce</HI> with her, provided they touch for a permit, at Corcubion in Gallicia, or at Ali|cant; and our rice is by the &s;ame ordinance, excluded from that country.&mdash;The circum&s;tances of the war have nece&s;&s;a|rily given us freer acce&s;s to the We&s;t-Indian i&s;lands, whil&s;t they have al&s;o drawn on our navigation, vexations and depreda|tions of the mo&s;t &s;erious nature.</P>
<P>To have endeavored to de&s;cribe all the&s;e, would have been as impracticable as u&s;ele&s;s, &s;ince the &s;cenes would have been &s;hifting, while under de&s;cription. I, therefore, think it be&s;t to leave the report, as it was formed, being adapted to a particular point of time, when things were in their &s;ettled order, that is to &s;ay, to the &s;ummer of <HI>1792.</HI></P>

<P><PB N="7" REF="026339_0006_0FCF85E511CC51F8">Of our commercial objects, SPAIN receives favour|ably, our bread &s;tuff, &s;alted fi&s;h, wood, &s;hips, tar, pitch, and turpentine. On our meals, however, as well as on tho&s;e of other foreign countries, when re-exported to their colonies, they have lately impo&s;ed duties, of from half a dollar, to two dollars the barrel, the duties being &s;o proportioned to the current price of their own flour, as that both together, are to make the con&s;tant &s;um of nine dollars per barrel.</P>
<P>They do not di&s;courage our rice, pot and pearl a&s;h, &s;alted provi&s;ions, or whale oil: but the&s;e articles, being in &s;mall demand at their markets, are carried thither but in a &s;mall degree. Their demand for rice, however, is increa&s;ing. Neither tobacco, nor indigo are received there. Our commerce is permitted with their Canary I&s;lands, under the &s;ame conditions.</P>
<P>Them&s;elves, and their colonies are the actual con&s;u|mers of what they receive from us.</P>
<P>Our navigation is free with the kingdom of Spain; foreign goods being received there in our &s;hips, on the &s;ame conditions as if carried in their own, or in the ve&s;|&s;els of the country of which &s;uch goods are the manu|facture or produce.</P>
<P>PORTUGAL receives favourably our grain, and bread, &s;alted fi&s;h and other &s;alted provi&s;ions, wood, tar, pitch, and turpentine.</P>
<P>For flax&s;eed, pot, and pearl a&s;h, though not di&s;coura|ged, there is little demand.</P>
<P>Our &s;hips pay twenty per cent. on being &s;old to their &s;ubjects, and are then free bottoms.</P>
<P>Foreign goods (except tho&s;e of the Ea&s;t-Indies) are received on the &s;ame footing in our ve&s;&s;els, as in their own, or any others; that is to &s;ay, on general duties of from twenty to twenty-eight per cent. and, con&s;equent|ly, our navigation is unob&s;tructed by them. Tobacco, rice and meals, are prohibited.</P>
<P>Them&s;elves and their colonies con&s;ume what they re|ceive from us.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="026339_0007_0FCF9CF1F4FE4CA8">The&s;e regulations extend to the Azores, Madeira, and the Cape de Verd I&s;lands, except, that in the&s;e, meals and rice are received freely.</P>
<P>FRANCE receives favourably our bread-&s;tuff, rice, wood, pot and pearl a&s;hes.</P>
<P>A duty of five &s;ous the kental, or nearly four and an half cents, is paid on our tar, pitch and turpentine. Our whale-oils pay &s;ix livres the kental, and are the only fo|reign whale-oils admitted. Our indigo pays five livres the kental; their own two and an half: but a difference of quality, &s;till more than a difference of duty, prevents its &s;eeking that market.</P>
<P>Salted beef is received freely for re-exportation; but if for home-con&s;umption, it pays five livres the kental. Other &s;alted provi&s;ions pay that duty in all ca&s;es, and &s;alted fi&s;h is made lately to pay the prohibitory one of twenty livres the kental.</P>
<P>Our &s;hips are free to carry thither all foreign goods, which may be carried in their own, or any other ve&s;&s;els, except tobaccoes not of our own growth: and they par|ticipate with theirs the exclu&s;ive carriage of our whale-oils, and tobaccoes.</P>
<P>During their former government, our tobacco was under a monopoly, but paid no duties; and our &s;hips were freely &s;old in their ports, and converted into nati|onal bottoms. The fir&s;t national a&s;&s;embly took from our &s;hips this privilege. They emancipated tobacco from its monopoly, but &s;ubjected it to duties of eigh|teen livres fifteen &s;ous the kental, carried in their own ve&s;&s;els, and twenty-five livres, carried in ours; a dif|ference more than equal to the freight of the article.</P>
<P>They and their colonies con&s;ume what they receive from us.</P>
<P>GREAT-BRITAIN receives our pot and pearl a&s;hes, free, while tho&s;e of other nations pay a duty of two &s;hillings and three pence the kental. There is an equal di&s;tinction in favour of our bar-iron; of which article
<PB N="9" REF="026339_0008_0FCF9CF337D00E30">
however we do not produce enough for our own u&s;e. Woods are free, from us, whil&s;t they pay &s;ome &s;mall duty from other countries. Indigo and flax-&s;eed, are free from all countries. Our tar and pitch pay eleven-pence &s;ter|ling the barrel. From other alien countries, they pay about a penny and a third more.</P>
<P>Our tobacco, for their own con&s;umption, pays 1<HI>&s;</HI>3 &s;terling the pound, cu&s;tom and exci&s;e, be&s;ides heavy ex|pen&s;es of collection. And rice, in the &s;ame ca&s;e, pays 7<HI>&s;</HI>4 &s;terling the hundred weight; which, rendering it too dear, as an article of common food, it is con&s;equently, u&s;ed in very &s;mall quantity.</P>
<P>Our &s;alted fi&s;h, and other &s;alted provi&s;ions, except bacon, are prohibited. Bacon and whale-oils are un|der prohibitory duties: &s;o are our grains, meals, and bread, as to internal con&s;umption; unle&s;s in times of &s;uch &s;carcity as may rai&s;e the price of wheat to 50<HI>&s;.</HI> &s;ter|ling the quarter, and other grains and meals in proportion.</P>
<P>Our &s;hips, though purcha&s;ed and navigated by their own &s;ubjects, are not permitted to be u&s;ed, even in their trade with us.</P>
<P>While the ve&s;&s;els of other nations are &s;ecured by &s;tanding laws, which cannot be altered, but by the con|current will of the three branches of the Briti&s;h legi&s;la|ture, in carrying thither any produce or manufacture of the country to which they belong, which may be lawfully carried in any ve&s;&s;els, ours, with the &s;ame pro|hibition of what is foreign, are further prohibited by a &s;tanding law (12. Car. 2.18. &sect;. 3.) from carrying thither all and any of our own dome&s;tic productions and manufactures. A &s;ub&s;equent act, indeed, has authori|zed their executive to permit the carriage of our own productions in our own bottoms, at its &s;ole di&s;cretion: and the permi&s;&s;ion has been given from year to year by proclamation; but &s;ubject every moment to be with|drawn on that &s;ingle will, in which event, our ve&s;&s;els having any thing on board, &s;tand interdicted from the entry of all Briti&s;h ports. The di&s;advantage of a te|nure
<PB N="10" REF="026339_0009_0FCF85ED0C323910">
which may be &s;o &s;uddenly di&s;continued, was expe|rienced by our merchants on a late occa&s;ion<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>April</HI> 12. 1792.</NOTE>, when an official notification that this law would be &s;trictly enfor|ced, gave them ju&s;t apprehen&s;ions for the fate of their ve&s;&s;els and cargoes di&s;patched or de&s;tined to the ports of Great-Britain. The mini&s;ter of that court indeed frankly expre&s;&s;ed his per&s;onal conviction that the words of the order went farther than was intended, and &s;o he afterwards officially informed us: but the embarra&s;&s;|ments of the moment were real and great, and the po&s;|&s;ibility of their renewal, lays our commerce to that country, under the &s;ame &s;pecies of di&s;couragement as to other countries, where it is regulated by a &s;ingle legi&s;|lator&punc; and the di&s;tinction is too remarkable not to be noticed, that our navigation is excluded from the &s;ecu|rity of fixed laws, while that &s;ecurity is given to the navigation of others.</P>
<P>Our ve&s;&s;els pay in their ports 1<HI>&s;</HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;terling per ton, light and trinity dues, more than is paid by Briti&s;h &s;hips, except in the port of London, where they pay the &s;ame as Briti&s;h.</P>
<P>The greater part of what they receive from us is re-exported to other countries, under the u&s;ele&s;s charges of an intermediate depo&s;ite, and double voyage. From tables publi&s;hed in England; and compo&s;ed as is &s;aid, from the books of their cu&s;tom-hou&s;es, it appears that of the indigo imported there in the years 1773,&mdash;4,&mdash;5, one third was re-exported; and from a document of au|thority, we learn, that, of the rice and tobacco imported there, before the war, four fifths were re-exported. We are a&s;&s;ured indeed, that the quantities &s;ent thither for re-exportation &s;ince the war, are con&s;iderably dimini&s;h|ed, yet le&s;s &s;o than rea&s;on and national intere&s;t would dictate. The whole of our grain is re-exported when wheat is below 50<HI>&s;.</HI> the quarter, and other grains in pro|portion.</P>
<P>The UNITED NETHERLANDS prohibit our pick|led beef and pork, meals and bread of all &s;orts, and lay a prohibitary duty on &s;pirits di&s;tilled from grain.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="026339_0010_0FCF9CF4A9F13690">All other of our productions are received on varied duties, which may be reckoned, on a medium at about three per cent.</P>
<P>They con&s;ume but a &s;mall proportion of what they receive. The re&s;idue is partly forwarded for con&s;ump|tion in the inland parts of Europe, and partly re-&s;hip|ped to other maritime countries. On the latter portion they intercept, between us and the con&s;umer &s;o much of the value as is ab&s;orbed by the charges attending an in|termediate depo&s;ite.</P>
<P>Foreign goods, except &s;ome Ea&s;t-India articles, are received in ve&s;&s;els of any nation.</P>
<P>Our &s;hips may be &s;old and naturalized there, with ex|ceptions of one or two privileges, which &s;omewhat le&s;|&s;en their value.</P>
<P>DENMARK lays con&s;iderable duties on our tobacco and rice, carried in their own ve&s;&s;els, and half as much more, if carried in ours; but the exact amount of the&s;e duties is not perfectly known here. They lay &s;uch as amount to prohibitions on our indigo and corn.</P>
<P>SWEDEN receives favourably our grains and meals, &s;alted provi&s;ions, indigo, and whale-oil.</P>
<P>They &s;ubject our rice to duties of &s;ixteen mills the pound weight, carried in their own ve&s;&s;els, and of forty per cent additional on that, or 22 4/10 mills, carried in ours, or any others. Being thus rendered too dear as an article of common food, little of it is con&s;umed with them. They con&s;ume &s;ome of our tobaccoes, which they take circuitou&s;ly through Great-Britain; levying hea|vy duties on them al&s;o; their duties of entry, town du|ties, and exci&s;e, being 4.34 dollars, the hundred weight, if carried in their own ve&s;&s;els, and of forty per cent on that additional, if earned in our own or any other ve&s;|&s;els.</P>
<P>They prohibit altogether our bread, fi&s;h, pot and pearl a&s;hes, flax-&s;eed&punc; tar, pitch, and turpentine, wood, (ex|cept oak timber and ma&s;ts) and all foreign manufac|tures.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="026339_0011_0FCF9CF61868AC28">Under &s;o many re&s;trictions and prohibitions, our navi|gation with them is reduced almo&s;t to nothing.</P>
<P>With our neighbours, an order of things much harder pre&s;ents it&s;elf.</P>
<P>SPAIN and PORTUGAL refu&s;e, to tho&s;e parts of Ame|rica which they govern, all direct intercour&s;e with any people but them&s;elves. The commodities in mutual de|mand, between them and their neighbours, mu&s;t be car|ried to be exchanged in &s;ome port of the dominant country; and the tran&s;portation between that and the &s;ubject-&s;tate mu&s;t be in a dome&s;tic bottom.</P>
<P>FRANCE by a &s;tanding law, permits her We&s;t-India po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"> to receive directly our vegetables, live-pro|vi&s;ions, hor&s;es, wood, tar, pitch, and turpentine, rice, and maize, and prohibits our other bread-&s;tuff: but a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of this prohibition having been left to the colonial legi&s;latures, in times of &s;carcity, it was former|ly &s;u&s;pended occa&s;ionally, but latterly without inter|ruption.</P>
<P>Our fi&s;h and &s;alted provi&s;ions (except pork) are re|ceived in their i&s;lands under a duty of three colonial livre the kental, and our ve&s;&s;els are as free as their own to carry our commodities thither, and to bring away rum and mola&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>GREAT-BRITAIN admits in her i&s;lands, our vege|tables, live-provi&s;ions, hor&s;es, wood, tar, pitch, and tur|pentine, rice, and bread-&s;tuff, by a proclamation of her executive, limited always to the term of a year, but hi|therto renewed from year to year. She prohibits our &s;alted fi&s;h, and other &s;alted provi&s;ions. She does not permit our ve&s;&s;els to carry thither our own produce.&mdash; Her ve&s;&s;els alone, may take it from us, and bring in ex|change, rum, mola&s;&s;es, &s;ugar, coffee, cocoa-nuts, ginger, and pimento. There are, indeed, &s;ome freedoms in the i&s;land of Dominica, but, under &s;uch circum&s;tances, as to be little u&s;ed by us. In the Briti&s;h continental colo|nies, and in Newfoundland, all our productions are pro|hibited,
<PB N="13" REF="026339_0012_0FCF9CF7A29AE300">
and our ve&s;&s;els forbidden to enter their ports. Their governors, however, in times of di&s;tre&s;s, have power to permit a temporary importation of certain ar|ticles, in their own bottoms, but not in ours.</P>
<P>Our citizens cannot re&s;ide as merchants or factors within any of the Briti&s;h plantations, this being expre&s;s|ly prohibited by the &s;ame &s;tatute of 12. Car. 2. C. 18, commonly called the navigation act.</P>
<P>In the DANISH-AMERICAN po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, a duty of five per cent. is levied on our corn, corn-meal, rice, to|bacco, wood, &s;alted fi&s;h, indigo, hor&s;es, mules, and live &s;tock; and of ten per cent. on our flour, &s;alted pork, and beef, tar, pitch, and turpentine.</P>
<P>In the AMERICAN i&s;lands of the UNITED NETHER|LANDS and SWEDEN, our ve&s;&s;els and produce are received, &s;ubject to duties, not &s;o heavy as to have been complained of: but they are heavier in the Dutch po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ions on the continent.</P>
<P>To &s;um up the&s;e RESTRICTIONS, &s;o far as they are important:</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. IN EUROPE&mdash;</P>
<P>Our bread-&s;tuff is at mo&s;t times under prohibitory duties in England, and con&s;iderably dutied on re-expor|tation from Spain to her colonies.</P>
<P>Our tobaccoes are heavily dutied in England, Swe|den and France, and prohibited in Spain, and Portugal.</P>
<P>Our rice is heavily dutied in England and Sweden, and prohibited in Portugal.</P>
<P>Our fi&s;h and &s;alted provi&s;ions are prohibited in Eng|land, and under prohibitory duties in France.</P>
<P>Our whale-oils are prohibited in England and Por|tugal.</P>
<P>And our ve&s;&s;els are denied naturalization in England, and of late in France.</P>
<P N="2">2d. IN THE WEST-INDIES.</P>
<P>All intercour&s;e is prohibited with the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of Spain, and Portugal.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="026339_0013_0FCF9CF9275C5EC8">Our &s;alted provi&s;ions and fi&s;h are prohibited by Eng|land.</P>
<P>Our &s;alted pork, and bread-&s;tuff (except maize) are received under temporary laws only, in the dominions of France, and our &s;alted fi&s;h pays there a weighty duty.</P>
<P N="3">3d. IN THE ARTICLE OF NAVIGATION.</P>
<P>Our own carriage of our own tobacco, is heavily du|tied in Sweden, and lately in France.</P>
<P>We can carry no article, not of our own production, to the Briti&s;h ports in Europe.</P>
<P>Nor even our own produce to her American po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>Such being the re&s;trictions on the commerce and na|vigation of the United States, the que&s;tion is, in what way they may be&s;t be removed, modified, or counteracted?</P>
<P>As to commerce, two methods occur, 1. By friend|ly arrangements with the &s;everal nations with whom the&s;e re&s;trictions exi&s;t: Or, 2. By the &s;eparate act of our own legi&s;latures for countervailing their effects.</P>
<P>There can be no doubt, but that of the&s;e two, friend|ly arrangement is the mo&s;t eligible. In&s;tead of embar|ra&s;&s;ing commerce under piles of regulating laws, duties, and prohibitions, could it be relieved from all its &s;hackles in all parts of the world&mdash;could every country be em|ployed in producing that which nature has be&s;t fitted it to produce, and each be free to exchange with others mutual &s;urplu&s;&s;es, for mutual wants, the greate&s;t ma&s;s po&s;&s;ible would then be produced of tho&s;e things which contribute to human life, and human happine&s;s; the numbers of mankind would be increa&s;ed, and their con|dition bettered.</P>
<P>Would even a &s;ingle nation begin with the United States this &s;y&s;tem of free commerce, it would be advi&s;a|ble to begin it with that nation; &s;ince it is one by one only, that it can be extended to all. Where the cir|cum&s;tances of either party render it expedient to levy a revenue, by way of impo&s;t, on commerce, its free|dom might be modified, in that particular, by mutual and equivalent mea&s;ures, pre&s;erving it entire in all others.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="026339_0014_0FCF9CFAE6913AE0">Some nations, not yet ripe for free commerce, in all its extent, might &s;till be willing to mollify its re&s;tricti|ons and regulations for us in proportion to the advanta|ges, which an intercour&s;e with us might offer. Parti|cularly they may concur with us in reciprocating the duties to be levied on each &s;ide, or in compen&s;ating any exce&s;s of duty, by equivalent advantages of another na|ture. Our commerce is certainly of a character to en|title it to favour in mo&s;t countries. The commodities we offer, are either nece&s;&s;aries of life; or materials for ma|nufacture; or convenient &s;ubjects of revenue: and we take in exchange, either manufactures, when they have re|ceived the la&s;t fini&s;h of art and indu&s;try; or mere luxu|ries. Such cu&s;tomers may rea&s;onably expect welcome, and friendly treatment at every market: cu&s;tomers too, who&s;e demands, increa&s;ing with their wealth, and po|pulation, mu&s;t very &s;hortly give full employment to the whole indu&s;try of any nation whatever, in any line of &s;upply they may get into the habit of calling for, from it.</P>
<P>But &s;hould any nation, contrary to our wi&s;hes, &s;up|po&s;e it may better find its advantage by continuing its &s;y&s;tem of prohibitions, duties, and regulations, it be|hoves us to protect our citizens, their commerce and navigation, by counter-prohibitions, duties, and regula|tions al&s;o. Free commerce and navigation are not to be given in exchange for re&s;trictions, and vexations; nor are they likely to produce a relaxation of them.</P>
<P>Our navigation involves &s;till higher con&s;iderations. As a branch of indu&s;try, it is valuable; but, as a re|&s;ource of defence, e&s;&s;ential.</P>
<P>Its value, as a branch of indu&s;try, is inhanced by the dependence of &s;o many other branches on it. In times of general peace it multiplies competitors for employ|ment in tran&s;portation, and &s;o keeps that at its proper level; and in times of war, that is to &s;ay, when tho&s;e nations who may be our principal carriers, &s;hall be at war with each other, if we have not within our&s;elves the means of tran&s;portation, our produce mu&s;t be export|ed
<PB N="16" REF="026339_0015_0FCF9CFC8B6A8FC8">
in belligerent ve&s;&s;els at the increa&s;ed expen&s;e of war|freight and in&s;urance, and the articles which will not bear that, mu&s;t peri&s;h on our hands.</P>
<P>But it is as a re&s;ource for defence that our navigation will admit neither neglect nor forbearance. The po|&s;ition and circum&s;tances of the United States leave them nothing to fear on their land-board, and nothing to de|&s;ire beyond their pre&s;ent rights. But, on their &s;ea|board, they are open to injury, and they have there too, a commerce which mu&s;t be protected. This can only be done by po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing a re&s;pectable body of citizen-&s;ea|men, and of arti&s;ts and e&s;tabli&s;hments in readine&s;s for &s;hip building.</P>
<P>Were the ocean, which is the common property of all, open to the indu&s;try of all, &s;o that every per&s;on and ve&s;&s;el &s;hould be free to take employment wherever it could be found, the United States would certainly not &s;et the example of appropriating to them&s;elves, exclu|&s;ively, any portion of the common &s;tock of occupation. They would rely on the enterprize and activity of their citizens for a due participation of the benefits of the &s;ea|faring bu&s;ine&s;s, and for keeping the marine cla&s;s of citi|zens equal to their object. But if particular nations gra&s;p at undue &s;hares, and more e&s;pecially, if they &s;eize on the means of the United States to convert them into aliment for their own &s;trength, and withdraw them en|tirely from the &s;upport of tho&s;e to whom they belong, defen&s;ive and protecting mea&s;ures become nece&s;&s;ary on the part of the nation who&s;e marine re&s;ources are thus invaded, or it will be di&s;armed of its defence; its pro|ductions will lie at the mercy of the nation which has po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed it&s;elf exclu&s;ively of the means of carrying them, and its politics may be influenced by tho&s;e who command its commerce. The carriage of our own commodities, if once e&s;tabli&s;hed in an other channel, cannot be re&s;umed in the moment we may de&s;ire. If we lo&s;e the &s;eamen and arti&s;ts, whom it now occupies, we lo&s;e the pre&s;ent means of marine defence, and time will be requi&s;ite to rai&s;e up others, when di&s;grace or
<PB N="17" REF="026339_0016_0FCF9CFF2540A2E8">
lo&s;&s;es &s;hall bring home to our feelings the error of having abandoned them. The materials for maintaining our due &s;hare of navigation, are ours in abundance; and, as to the mode of u&s;ing them, we have only to adopt the principles of tho&s;e who thus put us on the defen|&s;ive, or others, equivalent and better fitted to our cir|cum&s;tances.</P>
<P>The following principles, being founded in recipro|city, appear perfectly ju&s;t, and to offer no cau&s;e of com|plaint to any nation.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. Where a nation impo&s;es high duties on our pro|ductions, or prohibits them altogether, it may be pro|per for us to do the &s;ame by theirs, fir&s;t burthening or excluding tho&s;e productions which they bring here, in competition with our own of the &s;ame kind; &s;electing next &s;uch manufactures as we take from them in grea|te&s;t quantity, and which at the &s;ame time we could the &s;oone&s;t furni&s;h to our&s;elves, or obtain from other coun|tries; impo&s;ing on them duties, lighter at fir&s;t; but heavier and heavier afterwards, as other channels of &s;up|ply open. Such duties having the effect of indirect en|couragement to dome&s;tic manufactures of the &s;ame kind, may induce the manufacturer to come him&s;elf in|to the&s;e &s;tates, where cheaper &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, equal laws, and a vent of his wares, free of duty, may en&s;ure him the highe&s;t profits from his &s;kill and indu&s;try. And here it would be in the power of the &s;tate governments to co|operate e&s;&s;entially, by opening the re&s;ources of encou|ragement which are under their controul, extending them liberally to arti&s;ts in tho&s;e particular branches of manufacture, for which their &s;oil, climate, population, and other circum&s;tances, have matured them, and fo&s;|tering the precious efforts and progre&s;s of <HI>hou&s;ehold</HI> ma|nufacture by &s;ome patronage &s;uited to the nature of its objects, guided by the local informations they po&s;&s;e&s;s and guarded again&s;t abu&s;e by their pre&s;ence and atten|tions. The oppre&s;&s;ions on our agriculture in foreign ports would thus be made the occa&s;ion of relieving it
<PB N="18" REF="026339_0017_0FCF85F5190C8D48">
from a dependence on the councils and conduct of others, and of promoting arts, manufactures, and population at home.</P>
<P N="2">2d. Where a nation refu&s;es permi&s;&s;ion to our mer|chants and factors to re&s;ide within certain parts of their dominions, we may, if it &s;hould be thought expedient, refu&s;e re&s;idence to theirs in any and every part of ours, or modify their tran&s;actions.</P>
<P N="3">3d. Where a nation refu&s;es to receive in our ve&s;&s;els any productions but our own, we may refu&s;e to receive, in theirs, any but their own productions. The fir&s;t and &s;econd clau&s;es of the bill reported by the committee, are well formed to effect this object.</P>
<P N="4">4th. Where a nation refu&s;es to con&s;ider any ve&s;&s;el as ours, which has not been built within our territories, we &s;hould refu&s;e to con&s;ider as theirs, any ve&s;&s;el not built within their territories.</P>
<P N="5">5th. Where a nation refu&s;es to our ve&s;&s;els the car|riage even of our own productions, to certain countries under their domination, we might refu&s;e to theirs, of every de&s;cription, the carriage of the &s;ame productions to the &s;ame countries. But as ju&s;tice and good neighbor|hood would dictate, that tho&s;e who have no part in im|po&s;ing the re&s;triction on us, &s;hould not be the victims of mea&s;ures adopted to defeat its effect, it may be proper to confine the re&s;triction to ve&s;&s;els owned or navigated by any &s;ubjects of the &s;ame dominant power, other than the inhabitants of the country to which the &s;aid pro|ductions are to be carried. And to prevent all incon|venience to the &s;aid inhabitants, and to our own, by too &s;udden a check on the means of tran&s;portation, we may continue to admit the ve&s;&s;els marked for future ex|clu&s;ion, on an advanced tonnage, and for &s;uch length of time only, as may be &s;uppo&s;ed nece&s;&s;ary to provide again&s;t that inconvenience.</P>
<P>The e&s;tabli&s;hment of &s;ome of the&s;e principles by Great-Britain, alone, has already lo&s;t us in our com|merce with that country and its po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, between
<PB N="19" REF="026339_0018_0FCF9D00A00E3CE0">
eight and nine hundred ve&s;&s;els of near 40,000 tons bur|then, according to &s;tatements from official materials, in which they have confidence. This involves a propor|tional lo&s;s of &s;eamen, &s;hip-wrights, and &s;hip-building, and is too &s;erious a lo&s;s to admit forbearance of &s;ome effectual remedy.</P>
<P>It is true we mu&s;t expect &s;ome inconvenience in prac|tice, from the e&s;tabli&s;hment of di&s;criminating duties.&mdash; But in this, as in &s;o many other ca&s;es, we are left to chu&s;e between two evils. The&s;e inconveniencies are nothing, when weighed again&s;t the lo&s;s of wealth, and lo&s;s of force, which will follow our per&s;everance in the plan of indi&s;crimination. When once it &s;hall be perceived that we are either in the &s;y&s;tem, or the habit, of giving equal advantages to tho&s;e who extingui&s;h our commerce and navigation, by duties and prohibitions, as to tho&s;e who treat both with liberality and ju&s;tice, liberality and ju&s;tice will be converted by all into duties and prohibitions. It is not to the moderation and ju&s;tice of others, we are to tru&s;t for fair and equal acce&s;s to market with our produc|tions, or for our due &s;hare in the tran&s;portation of them; but to our own means of independence, and the firm will to u&s;e them. Nor do the inconveniences of di&s;cri|mination merit con&s;ideration. Not one of the nations before mentioned; perhaps, not a commercial nation on earth, is without them. In our ca&s;e, one di&s;tinc|tion alone will &s;uffice, that is to &s;ay, between nations who favor our productions and navigation, and tho&s;e who do not favour them. One &s;et of moderate duties, &s;ay the pre&s;ent duties, for the fir&s;t, and a fixed advance on the&s;e, as to &s;ome articles, and prohibitions as to others, for the la&s;t.</P>
<P>Still it mu&s;t be repeated that friendly arrangements are preferable with all who will come into them; and that we &s;hould carry into &s;uch arrangements all the liberali|ty and &s;pirit of accommodation, which the nature of the ca&s;e will admit.</P>
<P>France has, of her own accord, propo&s;ed negotiati+ons for improving, by a new treaty on fair and equal
<PB N="20" REF="026339_0019_0FCF9D06C09DCA88">
principles, the commercial relations of the two coun|tries. But her internal di&s;turbances have hitherto pre|vented the pro&s;ecution of them to effect, though we have had repeated a&s;&s;urances of a continuance of the di&s;po&s;ition.</P>
<P>Propo&s;als of friendly arrangement have been made on our part, by the pre&s;ent government, to that of Great Britain, as the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;tates: but being already on as good a footing <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> and a better in fact, than the mo&s;t favoured nation, they have not, as yet, di&s;covered any di&s;po&s;ition to have it meddled with.</P>
<P>We have no rea&s;on to conclude that friendly arrange|ments would be declined by the other nations, with whom we have &s;uch commercial intercour&s;e as may ren|der them important. In the mean while, it would re&s;t with the wi&s;dom of Congre&s;s to determine whether, as to tho&s;e nations, they will not &s;urcea&s;e exparte regula|tions, on the rea&s;onable pre&s;umption that they will con|cur in doing whatever ju&s;tice and moderation, dictate &s;hould be done.</P>
