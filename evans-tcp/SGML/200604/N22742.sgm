<Q><BIBL>2 TIMOTHY, I.8.</BIBL>
<P>&mdash;BE THOU PARTAKER OF THE AFFLICTIONS OF THE GOSPEL, ACCORDING TO THE POWER OF GOD.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>WHEN the great Apo&s;tle of the Gentiles was fir&s;t called to be an amba&s;&s;ador of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the Lord was plea&s;ed to &s;hew him how great things he mu&s;t &s;uffer for his name's &s;ake; and during the whole cour&s;e of his mini&s;try, the Holy Gho&s;t witne&s;&s;ed that in every city, bonds and afflictions awaited him. But &s;uch was his invincible re&s;olution in the &s;ervice of his divine Ma&s;ter, that none of the&s;e things moved him, nor did he count his life dear to him&s;elf, &s;o that he might fini&s;h his cour&s;e with joy, and the mini&s;try which he had received of the Lord.</P>
<P>HAVING pa&s;&s;ed through a cour&s;e of laborious and faithful &s;ervice; having endured every affliction, and &s;urmounted every difficulty which lay in his way, and having arrived &s;o near the end of life as to be able to &s;ay, "I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at hand;" he does, in this epi&s;tle, (one of the la&s;t which he wrote) encourage
<PB N="6" REF="030052_0004_0FE4175238393FE0">
his &s;on Timothy to imitate his example, and not to be a&s;hamed of the te&s;timony of the Lord, nor of him who was then a pri&s;oner for his &s;ake; but to be a partaker with him of the afflictions of the go&s;pel.</P>
<P>HAD Paul him&s;elf been a&s;hamed of the cau&s;e he had undertaken to &s;upport, or had he been con&s;cious of an error therein, natural affection would have prompted him (as is common with dying malefactors) to warn his beloved friend, of the danger of following his example, and to exhort him to a different cour&s;e of life: but knowing in whom he had believed; knowing the dignity and importance of the work to which Timothy had been ordained, and the certain reward which awaited the faithful mini&s;ter; knowing that the &s;pirit by which they both were animated was not the &s;pirit of fear, but of power and love and of a &s;ound mind, his tenderne&s;s toward him operated in a different way, and prompted him rather to de&s;ire that Timothy &s;hould continue &s;tedfa&s;t in his Ma&s;ter's work, and patiently endure the afflictions of the go&s;|pel.</P>
<P>SUCH a pathetic exhortation, enforced by &s;o &s;trik|ing an example, could not but have great force on the mind of this young evangeli&s;t; and, as it was written not for his &s;ake alone, but for a &s;tanding di|rection to go&s;pel mini&s;ters, we have rea&s;on to believe that it has had a very exten&s;ive influence in the pa&s;t ages of Chri&s;tianity. It &s;till continues on record for our admonition and encouragement.</P>
<P>IT was more e&s;pecially nece&s;&s;ary that the primitive mini&s;ters &s;hould have &s;uch an exhortation addre&s;&s;ed to them, becau&s;e of the peculiar and extraordinary trials which many of them had to undergo. The genius of Chri&s;tianity was &s;o oppo&s;ite to all the prevailing religious opinions and e&s;tabli&s;hments in the heathen world, and made &s;uch a &s;urprizing progre&s;s in turning men from darkne&s;s to light, and from &s;erving dumb
<PB N="7" REF="030052_0005_0FE417E6FB35B318">
idols to wor&s;hipping the living God, that the ruling powers became jealous of its growth, and laboured, by the mo&s;t &s;anguinary terrors, to &s;uppre&s;s or eradi|cate it. The public mini&s;ters of Chri&s;tianity being always di&s;tingui&s;hed by their office, were often di&s;tin|gui&s;hed by their &s;ufferings; and in this re&s;pect, as well as others, they were called to be examples to the flock; examples of patience and fortitude in their adherence to Chri&s;t and his cau&s;e, amid&s;t the mo&s;t terrible oppo&s;ition of their enemies; whom neither rea&s;on could per&s;uade, nor experience convince, of the folly of their attempt. The profe&s;&s;ion of Chri&s;tianity, and e&s;pecially the public character which the mini&s;ters of the go&s;pel &s;u&s;tained, was then attended with the greate&s;t hazard; and therefore they needed &s;ome &s;pecial &s;upport and encouragement. But though the mini&s;ters and di&s;ciples of Je&s;us Chri&s;t are not now expo&s;ed to the peril of their lives for the &s;ake of Chri&s;t and his religion; yet the exhortation in the text has a very important u&s;e; and the Holy Gho&s;t, who indited it, knew that there would always be &s;ufficient need of it. The world has not lo&s;t that &s;pirit of op|po&s;ition to the truth, which it had in the primitive times; the mode of its operation is changed; but the inveteracy of it remains; it is often brought into view, and produces di&s;agreeable effects. There are &s;till many afflictions to which the mini&s;ters of the go&s;|pel are expo&s;ed, and which they may certainly expect to meet with, if they continue &s;teadily and earne&s;tly engaged in their duty, and are determined to keep a con&s;cience void of offence towards God and man.</P>
<P>IN common with other men, we are &s;ubject to all tho&s;e providential afflictions which God &s;ends as fath|erly cha&s;ti&s;ements to correct his people for their errors, to try their virtues, and make them partakers of his holine&s;s. But be&s;ide the&s;e, WE are &s;ubject to afflictions of a peculiar kind, which may, with &s;trict propriety, be called "the afflictions of the go&s;pel," becau&s;e they
<PB N="8" REF="030052_0006_0FE41753E41E4AC8">
befal us on account of our peculiar character as the mini&s;ters of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. The&s;e afflictions ari&s;e from tho&s;e corrupt lu&s;ts and pa&s;&s;ions which are always working in oppo&s;ition to divine truth, under the in|fluence of the prince of darkne&s;s.</P>
<P>HAPPY would it be for us, if we did not experience much affliction ari&s;ing from our own unmortified lu&s;ts and pa&s;&s;ions. We are, like other men, compounded of fle&s;h and &s;pirit; and we often find, to our &s;orrow, that the fle&s;h lu&s;teth again&s;t the &s;pirit, &s;o that we can|not do the things which we would; and when we would do good, evil is pre&s;ent with us. But if, through grace, we do obtain, in &s;ome degree, the ma&s;tery over our own corruptions; yet we &s;hall not find it &s;o practicable to keep the lu&s;ts and pa&s;&s;ions of other men, of tho&s;e with whom we have a nece&s;&s;ary connection, yea of our deare&s;t friends, in the &s;ame degree of &s;ubjection. We &s;hall find very &s;harp and &s;evere afflictions ari&s;ing from this &s;ource; of the&s;e we are exhorted to be partakers; and we &s;hall find &s;uf|ficient comfort and &s;upport in the divine word to enable us to bear them with patience.</P>
<P>IT may be proper to enumerate &s;ome of tho&s;e pe|culiar trials which may be ju&s;tly called the <HI>afflictions of the go&s;pel;</HI> and then &s;how why, and in what &s;en&s;e, the <HI>power of God</HI> is given as a rea&s;on of the exhorta|tion to be <HI>partakers</HI> of the&s;e afflictions.</P>
<P N="1">1. ONE of the&s;e afflictions, of which we are called to partake, is <HI>the un&s;ucce&s;sfulne&s;s of our labours.</HI> Who hath believed our report? is an old complaint among the mini&s;ters of God. The world, and the things of the world, have taken &s;uch firm hold of men's hearts as to engro&s;s the principal part of their attention, and leave little room for things of a &s;piritual nature. Pre&s;ent things afford &s;ome pro&s;pect of pre&s;ent good; whil&s;t things un&s;een and eternal are imagined to be at a great di&s;tance, and not to require our pre&s;ent at|tention.
<PB N="9" REF="030052_0007_0FE4175597683000">
This is the general temper of the world, and this is what &s;huts the go&s;pel out of men's hearts. Cu&s;tom, and a &s;en&s;e of decency, will induce &s;ome of them to an outward ob&s;ervance of religious duties, and attendance on divine in&s;titutions, and even to treat us with a degree of re&s;pect, becau&s;e of our &s;a|cred character; but their hearts will not be touched with a &s;erious &s;en&s;e of divine things, nor will their lives and behaviour be regulated by the go&s;pel. Such were the people to whom the Prophet Ezekiel mini&s;|tered: "They come to thee as the people cometh, and they &s;it before thee as my people, and they hear thy wor<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters"> but they will not do them; for with their mouth they &s;hew much love, but their heart goeth after their covetou&s;ne&s;s. And lo, thou art to them as a very lovely &s;ong of one that hath a plea&s;ant voice, and can play well on an in&s;trument, for they hear thy words, but they do them not." Such a kind of be|haviour in people may &s;uit one who is &s;eeking his own ea&s;e and comfort and popularity; but the true mini&s;ter of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, though he cannot but be plea&s;ed with outward tokens of re&s;pect, becau&s;e they are in a degree &s;ub&s;ervient to his u&s;efulne&s;s; yet is not &s;atisfied with them, as an&s;wering the end of his mini&s;try. He knows the value of &s;ouls, and of that precious blood which was &s;hed to redeem them. He knows the great importance of the work which he has undertaken, and the &s;olemn account which he mu&s;t render of his &s;teward&s;hip; and therefore his heart's de&s;ire and prayer to God is, that they may be &s;aved. He longs to &s;ee the truth take hold of their hearts, and &s;hew its happy fruit in their holy and exemplary lives. But as a cour&s;e of di&s;appointment in any of our dar|ling expectations is a grief and burden to the mind, &s;o it may be concluded, that the faithful mini&s;ter &s;uffers great affliction from a view of the un&s;ucce&s;sfulne&s;s of his labours. When, after all his inten&s;e &s;tudies, his watchings and &s;elf-denial, he finds that his hearers are &s;till hardened through the deceitfulne&s;s of &s;in, deaf to
<PB N="10" REF="030052_0008_0FE417579253FC70">
the calls and invitations of the go&s;pel, and blind to their true intere&s;t; when he reflects that his earne&s;t|ne&s;s in &s;eeking their good may prove an aggravation of their guilt; when he &s;ees them dropping, one after another, into the grave, and has rea&s;on to fear that many of them will peri&s;h through their own negli|gence and folly; the&s;e things mu&s;t affect him with the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible grief, whil&s;t he &s;ilently adores that tremendous ju&s;tice which &s;uffers &s;o many unhappy &s;ouls to plunge them&s;elves into the mi&s;ery of the fu|ture world.</P>
<P N="2">2. THE <HI>levity and incon&s;tancy,</HI> which appear in men's religious conduct, prove another &s;ource of affliction to the mini&s;ters of the go&s;pel. Where people have been u&s;ed to a variety of preaching, they are very apt to grow nice and ta&s;ty, to di&s;cover a fondne&s;s for novelty, and to be plea&s;ed or di&s;plea&s;ed with &s;ome external circum&s;tances attending the preacher, as his looks, his voice, his ge&s;ture, his &s;tyle and manner, without any regard to the truth preached, or the con&s;equence of receiving or rejecting it. If it comes attended with &s;ome particular circum&s;tances, then it is plea&s;ing, not for the &s;ake of its own intrin&s;ic worth and excellency, but on account of tho&s;e external circum&s;tances; whereas if the truth be ever &s;o plainly and faithfully delivered, yet if it be de&s;titute of tho&s;e ornaments which attract the fancy and plea&s;e the ta&s;te, it is de&s;pi&s;|ed and rejected. Men's per&s;ons are had in admiration becau&s;e of &s;ome external advantages, and they are not e&s;teemed highly in love for their work's &s;ake. How painful mu&s;t it be to a true go&s;pel mini&s;ter, who has been a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly labouring to come to his people, and bring them the &s;incere milk of the word, that they may grow thereby, to find his labours &s;lighted becau&s;e of a deficiency in tho&s;e external accompli&s;hments, which are no e&s;&s;ential part of the furniture of a go&s;pel preacher. The Apo&s;tle Paul experienced much of this affliction. He came not with excellency of &s;peech, nor
<PB N="11" REF="030052_0009_0FE417E8ABAF4DC8">
in the words of man's wi&s;dom; his bodily pre&s;ence was weak, and his &s;peech contemptible; and when he preached the go&s;pel in the learned and inqui&s;itive city of Athens, the compliment paid him by that polite a&s;&s;embly was, "What will this babbler &s;ay?" But the &s;ervant mu&s;t not expect to be greater than his Lord. Je&s;us him&s;elf, the be&s;t friend of mankind, was received by his audience with &s;uch contemptuous language as
<Q>Can any good thing come out of Naza|reth? This man is a wine-bibber and a drunkard, a friend of publicans and &s;inners.</Q>
Was it not an occa&s;ion of grief to his holy &s;oul, and to his faithful Apo&s;tles, to find them&s;elves &s;o di&s;re&s;pectfully and ig|nominiou&s;ly treated? and can it be otherwi&s;e to every &s;incere mini&s;ter of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, to find him&s;elf de&s;pi&s;|ed, and his te&s;timony rejected, by &s;uch idle and &s;uper|ficial hearers? Or if he has not &s;o large a &s;hare of it him&s;elf, yet does it not grieve him, to &s;ee and hear any of his brethren, with whom he is jointly labouring in the Lord's vineyard, and for whom he entertains a cordial and &s;ympathetic affection, thus ba&s;ely treat|ed; whil&s;t, on the other hand, he &s;ees multitudes of people carried away by an empty noi&s;e, and dazzled by a fal&s;e glare of impudent attractions, when there is no &s;olid food for their &s;ouls; leaving the &s;ub&s;tantial entertainment, prepared for them by the &s;tricte&s;t care, and running after the frothy tra&s;h which is pre&s;ented to them in a manner flattering to their imagination, and gratifying to their pa&s;&s;ions. Let &s;uch trials lead us to reflect, how vain a thing is mere popularity! how low in the e&s;teem of him who was de&s;pi&s;ed and rejected of men! and how earne&s;tly &s;hould we &s;eek the more valuable accompli&s;hment of being able, by manife&s;tation of the truth, to commend our&s;elves to every man's con&s;cience in the &s;ight of God.</P>
<P N="3">3. ANOTHER of the afflictions of the go&s;pel is the <HI>oppo&s;ition</HI> which we &s;ometimes meet in the way of our duty. We are commanded not only to preach the
<PB N="12" REF="030052_0010_0FE417EAA9591D10">
word, but to reprove and rebuke offenders, either privately, in clo&s;e conver&s;ation, or publicly, in the way of church di&s;cipline. This is a very nece&s;&s;ary, but difficult and unplea&s;ing part of mini&s;terial duty, and we go to it as &s;oldiers go on a forlorn hope: for as it is a direct attack on the lu&s;ts and pa&s;&s;ions of man|kind, &s;o it is natural to expect a repul&s;e. Though armed with re&s;olution, and conducted by wi&s;dom and judgment, yet we often find the voice of rea&s;on too weak to be heard, where lu&s;t and pa&s;&s;ion have u&s;urped the government of the mind. There are &s;ome tempers which will hearken to nothing which pre&s;umes to contradict the reigning de&s;ire, or bring the lawfulne&s;s of it into que&s;tion. Men will readily condemn what they ob&s;erve ami&s;s in others, as David did when he heard Nathan relate the &s;tory of the rich man who took away the poor man's lamb; but when it comes clo&s;e to the con&s;cience, as did the application of that parable, "Thou art the man," it requires a great degree of patience, humility and tenderne&s;s of mind, to receive the &s;hock in the &s;ame manner that David did; and as the&s;e qualities are not to be found in every man, &s;o wherever they are wanting, we may expect oppo&s;ition and ill &s;ucce&s;s. In&s;tead of having our reproof received with meekne&s;s, we &s;hall hear the voice of recrimination; and the proverb, "Phy&s;ician, heal thy&s;elf," will be retorted. Or we &s;hall be thought hard and cruel, or charged with fal&s;hood, or want of charity, or taking up an ill report. Or they will endeavour to revenge them&s;elves, by inventing lies again&s;t us, where there is no real ground of accu|&s;ation. The prophet complains of tho&s;e to whom he was obliged to admini&s;ter reproofs in the name of the Lord, that they con&s;pired again&s;t him, &s;aying, "Come, let us devi&s;e devices again&s;t Jeremiah, let us <HI>&s;mite him with the tongue,</HI> and let us not give heed to any of his words." And the Apo&s;tle Paul was, by &s;ome of his brethren, counted an enemy becau&s;e he told them the truth.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="030052_0011_0FE417F0C33B1A48">THE principal difficulties of this kind ari&s;e from the hypocri&s;y which too often reigns among profe&s;&s;ors of religion. As a hollow tree makes a much greater noi&s;e, when &s;truck, than one which is &s;ound; &s;o the hypocrite, when his faults are reproved with chri&s;tian fidelity, will make a loud noi&s;e, either in vindicating his own character, or finding fault with his reprover; whereas a true chri&s;tian receives a rebuke with meek|ne&s;s and patience. Let the righteous &s;mite me, &s;aid David, and it &s;hall be a kindne&s;s, and their reproof &s;hall be an excellent oil, which &s;hall not break my head. A reproof, &s;ays Solomon, enters deeper into a wi&s;e man than a hundred &s;tripes into the back of a fool. The wounds of God's true children will bear to be &s;earched, and are &s;oon healed; but the wounds of the hypocrite are full of proud fle&s;h, which keeps them always &s;ore.</P>
<P>BESIDES the oppo&s;ition which we meet in the way of reproof and di&s;cipline, there is much difficulty ari&s;|ing from the ignorance, the weakne&s;s, the prejudices, and the narrow views of &s;ome of our brethren, whom we charitably hope to be &s;incere. The&s;e cau&s;es will &s;ometimes produce a degree of ob&s;tinacy, and even violence, which may be mi&s;taken for religious zeal, and operate to the di&s;turbance of order and peace in chri&s;tian &s;ocieties. Such things are a great affliction to the mini&s;ters of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. It grieves them to &s;ee that their mo&s;t laborious, and, as they hope, pru|dent and faithful endeavours to remove &s;candals, to convince gain&s;ayers, to eradicate errors, to awaken men from a delu&s;ive, dangerous, hypocritical &s;leep, to pluck them out of the fire, and to pre&s;erve or re&s;tore the purity of churches and divine ordin|ances, meet with &s;o much oppo&s;ition from the pride, the perver&s;ene&s;s, and the prejudices of man|kind, though they are a&s;&s;ured, and their Lord hath forewarned them, it is impo&s;&s;ible but that offences will come.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="14" REF="030052_0012_0FE417F2C5369458">4. ANOTHER affliction to which we are &s;ubjected is <HI>the contempt and reproach of the profane.</HI> The world has always been an enemy to the truth. Satan loves to keep his &s;trong hold in peace; but when this guilty peace is in danger of being di&s;turbed by the plain and faithful preaching of the go&s;pel, or the ex|emplary conduct of its mini&s;ters, his endeavour is to render their work un&s;ucce&s;sful by exciting his in&s;tru|ments to reproach, to ridicule, and de&s;pi&s;e them. If any, who bear the character of go&s;pel mini&s;ters, are &s;o unhappy as to fall into open &s;ins, reproach is liberally ca&s;t on the whole order, and we are &s;aid to be all alike, though our faults are not made &s;o public. How many ba&s;e reflections, &s;neering jokes, and con|temptuous &s;arca&s;ms are ca&s;t on us, as if we preach only for hire; how little allowance is made for our unavoidable infirmities, interruptions and tempta|tions; and how much more is expected of us than is rea&s;onable. If we fail in any part of our duty, how much greater &s;hare of reproach do we &s;uffer than oth|er men in the &s;ame circum&s;tances. How often is the tongue of &s;lander let loo&s;e upon us; our mo&s;t inno|cent actions are looked upon with an eye of &s;u&s;picion, and our private conduct pried into with a bu&s;y and impertinent curio&s;ity! If we preach again&s;t any par|ticular &s;ins, or de&s;cribe any particular &s;ort of bad character, &s;ome per&s;on or other will think he is point|ed at, will be offended, and &s;hew his re&s;entment. On the other hand, if we &s;peak only in general terms, to avoid giving offence, then we are cen&s;ured as general preachers, who do not &s;peak clo&s;e to the con&s;ciences of our hearers. Both our public performances and our private conver&s;ation are expo&s;ed to the attacks of malicious, cavilling and prejudiced tempers; and he mu&s;t be more than human, who can behave &s;o up|rightly and circum&s;pectly as in all ca&s;es to avoid giv|ing offence; e&s;pecially when we con&s;ider that we can recommend no duty but what &s;ome per&s;on neglects, and condemn no &s;in but what &s;ome per&s;on commits.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="030052_0013_0FE417F46EFC9C38">IT is incon&s;i&s;tent with the character of a go&s;pel min|i&s;ter to be a man-plea&s;er. "If I yet plea&s;ed men," &s;ays the Apo&s;tle Paul, "I &s;hould not be the &s;ervant of Chri&s;t." Indeed we ought to be conde&s;cending to men's capacities and peculiarities in things of indiffer|ence; for the &s;ame Apo&s;tle &s;ays, that he became all things to all men, and that he plea&s;ed men for their good to edification. But beyond this, chri&s;tian fidel|ity will not warrant us to go; and yet if we find our|&s;elves obliged to &s;peak or act in a manner contrary to men's old e&s;tabli&s;hed opinions and inveterate preju|dices; yea, if we do not actually fall in with, and hu|mour them, we &s;hall incur their re&s;entment and for|feit their favour. We often find, by our own expe|rience, that the tempers of mankind are &s;uch as our Lord de&s;cribed the Jews to be. "Whereto &s;hall I liken this generation? It is like children &s;itting in the market, and calling to their fellows, &s;aying, We have piped to you, and ye have not danced; we have mourned to you, and ye have not lamented. For John came neither eating nor drinking, and ye &s;ay he hath a devil. The &s;on of man is come eating and drinking, and ye &s;ay, Behold a man gluttonous, a wine-bibber, a friend of publicans and &s;inners. But wi&s;dom is ju&s;tified of her children."</P>
<P N="5">5. ANOTHER of the afflictions to which we are ex|po&s;ed, is the re&s;entment of pretended patriots, when we oppo&s;e their views in endeavouring to &s;erve our country. There is a monopolizing &s;pirit in &s;ome politicians, which would exclude clergymen from all attention to matters of &s;tate and government; which would prohibit us from bringing political &s;ubjects into the pulpit, and even threaten us with the lo&s;s of our livings if we move at all in the political &s;phere.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">HAD this di&s;cour&s;e been delivered twenty or twenty-five years ago, it might have been conjectured that the politicians here meant were tories, and under Briti&s;h influence! The &s;ame language is now held by &s;ome who think them&s;elves the be&s;t friends of America!</NOTE> But, my brethren, I con&s;ider politics as intimately con|nected
<PB N="16" REF="030052_0014_0FE417F66842B3A0">
with morality, and both with religion. If the political character of a people is bad, their morals are equally bad, and their religion is good for nothing. The &s;ame man who appears in the character of a poli|tician, is al&s;o a &s;ubject of moral government, and a candidate for immortality. Therefore if he act right or wrong as a politician, he acts equally right or wrong as a &s;ubject of God's moral government; his cha|racter as a politician will be brought into the grand review at the la&s;t day, and his future &s;tate will be determined accordingly. This doctrine, I am &s;en&s;ible, is not agreeable to the practice of &s;ome men, who act with a tolerable regard to the principles of morality in their common bu&s;ine&s;s; but when they get into a political body, relax their ideas of morality, and en|deavour to carry a point by any means whatever. Again&s;t &s;uch an idea of politics, I think it my duty to prote&s;t; for I believe that hone&s;ty is the be&s;t policy, both in private and public life.</P>
<P>NOW if it be the duty of go&s;pel mini&s;ters to preach morality, it is their duty to preach it to public as well as private men. Did not the ancient prophets warn the princes of I&s;rael and Judah of their duty, and re|prove them for their mi&s;conduct in their political characters? Did not our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t recom|mend to the Jews to render to Cae&s;ar the things which were Cae&s;ar's, in direct and decided contradiction to the principles of the <HI>di&s;organizing</HI> Phari&s;ees? Did not the Apo&s;tle Paul, in his epi&s;tle to the Romans, de&s;cribe the character of good and bad rulers, and teach the Chri&s;tians how to di&s;tingui&s;h one from the other? Did not the Apo&s;tle Peter pointedly denounce the judgment of God again&s;t tho&s;e who de&s;pi&s;e govern|ment, and &s;peak evil of dignities, &s;tigmatizing them with the epithets of pre&s;umptuous and &s;elf-willed; characterizing them as political hypocrites, who, whil&s;t they promi&s;e liberty, are them&s;elves &s;ervants of cor|ruption; comparing them to Balaam, who loved the
<PB N="17" REF="030052_0015_0FE417FAEFF776F8">
wages of unrighteou&s;ne&s;s; and applying to them that true proverb, The dog is turned to his own vomit, and the &s;ow that was wa&s;hed to her wallowing in the mire?<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See 2 Peter, chap. ii. ver. 10, 1<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">, 19, 22.</NOTE> This, in the apo&s;tolic age, was plain, hone&s;t, go&s;pel preaching; and if there appear any &s;uch cha|racters among us, why &s;hould not the mini&s;ters of the go&s;pel, in the &s;ame manner, expo&s;e them to the public odium? It is true, that the Apo&s;tles did not call &s;uch men by their proper names, but only drew their cha|racter, and left it to be applied where it belonged. The like prudence &s;hould we u&s;e; but if men will conde&s;cend to wear &s;uch a character, they mu&s;t blame them&s;elves for the reproach which is nece&s;&s;arily attached to it.</P>
<P>THE Roman government, under which the Apo&s;tles lived, was a mixture of the old republican forms with military de&s;poti&s;m: That government was e&s;tabli&s;h|ed; but the Jews, though protected and indulged in the free exerci&s;e of their religion, were continually unea&s;y, and frequently exciting in&s;urrection and re|volt, not only in the province of Judea, but in their various di&s;per&s;ions through the empire. To this <HI>di&s;|organizing faction,</HI> the apo&s;tolic reproofs were addre&s;&s;ed; for as the Chri&s;tian Religion was not de&s;igned to over|throw any of the kingdoms of this world, &s;o it inculcat|ed a &s;pirit of peace and loyalty on all who profe&s;&s;ed it.</P>
<P>HAD the Apo&s;tles lived in the&s;e days, and among us, who have the privilege of choo&s;ing our own rulers, I have no doubt that they would have exhorted us to exerci&s;e our privileges by none but hone&s;t and lawful means. They would have advi&s;ed the people to carry the principles of Chri&s;tian morality to a town-meeting as well as to the exchange. They would have advi&s;ed legi&s;lators to carry the &s;ame principles to the &s;enate and hou&s;e of a&s;&s;embly; they would have advi&s;ed executive and judicial officers to carry the &s;ame prin|ciples to the bar, to the bench, to the council-board, and to the Governor's chair. They would have ad|vi&s;ed us to be con&s;i&s;tent and uniform in our regards
<PB N="18" REF="030052_0016_0FE4175E77FCC380">
to God and man, in every &s;ituation, private or public&punc; and this is the duty of go&s;pel mini&s;ters.</P>
<P>IT is very &s;trange that we may not preach on the &s;ame &s;ubjects which are recommended to us as &s;ubjects of prayer. In the annual proclamations for fa&s;ts and thank&s;givings we are exhorted to pray and give thanks on a great variety of political &s;ubjects, foreign and dome&s;tic. And what good rea&s;on can be given why the&s;e &s;ame &s;ubjects &s;hould not be di&s;cour&s;ed on, as well as prayed over? It is expected, that we bring them into the pulpit in our prayers, and it is by &s;ome people highly re&s;ented if we do not. When we have them in our mind as proper &s;ubjects for devotion, why &s;hould we not &s;peak and di&s;cour&s;e on them for the in&s;truction of our hearers? Mu&s;t we make an addre&s;s to God on political &s;ubjects, and may we not make an addre&s;s to our brethren on the &s;ame &s;ubjects? I would not be guilty of &s;o &s;trange an incon&s;i&s;tency.</P>
<P>IT &s;hould be con&s;idered that we are men of like pa&s;&s;ions with others. We feel our&s;elves intere&s;ted equally with our brethren in the &s;ame religious, moral, and political matters; and where there is freedom of &s;peech, as I tru&s;t there always will be in this happy country, we ought not to be blamed if we u&s;e the liberty of Americans to &s;peak our minds at proper times, and in a decent manner, on political as well as on moral and religious topics.</P>
<P>BUT "there is a generation that are pure in their own eyes, though their teeth are as &s;words!" And how liberal are &s;ome tongues, &s;ome pens, and &s;ome pre&s;&s;es, with their abu&s;e, when we appear warm and zealous in the cau&s;e of our country! When we &s;peak or write in &s;upport of its liberties, its con&s;titution, its peace and its honor, we are &s;tigmatized as bu&s;y-bodies, as tools of a party, as meddling with what does not belong to us, and u&s;urping authority over our brethren.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="030052_0017_0FE417FE09E3BD00">WHATEVER may be the views of tho&s;e who are of a different opinion from me, re&s;pecting this matter, yet I con&s;ider their principle, that the clergy have no right to meddle with politics, and their endeavour to &s;top our mouths, as "pregnant with mi&s;chief," tend|ing to keep the people in ignorance, and expo&s;ing them to be mi&s;led by tho&s;e who would always pretend that the people &s;hall govern, provided that they &s;hall govern the people.</P>
<P>THE time has been, when &s;ome of the&s;e &s;ame per|&s;ons were very fond of engaging the clergy in politics, encouraging them to write and preach, or, to u&s;e a phra&s;e of their own, "blow the trumpet," in defence of the liberties of their country. But, alas, how changed, how fallen! From &s;uch politicians, and &s;uch patriots, the good Lord deliver us!</P>
<P N="6">6. THERE is another affliction of the go&s;pel, which I would gladly omit, if the omi&s;&s;ion might not be deemed improper, and that is the difficulty which we &s;ometimes experience for want of a <HI>competent temporal &s;upport.</HI> Though the Apo&s;tles in the infancy of the church, laboured with their hands that they might not be chargeable to the new converts, yet they challenged it as a right, not only for them&s;elves, but for all &s;ucceeding mini&s;ters, that tho&s;e who preach the go&s;pel &s;hould live of the go&s;pel. This is a dic|tate of rea&s;on and ju&s;tice, an injunction of the law of God, and of the government under which we live. But in many in&s;tances it happens, that through cov|etou&s;ne&s;s, or carele&s;&s;ne&s;s, or prejudice, or a &s;pirit of eva&s;ion and procra&s;tination, the &s;upport we receive is either in&s;ufficient in it&s;elf, or is &s;o long in coming, that we are reduced to &s;traits and &s;ufferings for want of it. In the&s;e ca&s;es, we have but a choice of difficult|ies. If we complain, we are cen&s;ured as impatient and querulous. If we lie &s;till, and do nothing to help our&s;elves, we are &s;aid to be carele&s;s and improv|ident. If we &s;olicit benefactions, we are &s;tigmatized <PB N="20" REF="030052_0018_0FE417FFB34AD430">
as beggars. If we work with our hands, or engage in any literary labours, we are called worldly mind|ed, and negligent of our proper bu&s;ine&s;s. If we ap|peal to the laws of our country, and compel our peo|ple to do us ju&s;tice, it is a wonder if there be not &s;uch a &s;pirit of re&s;entment rai&s;ed again&s;t us, as will either make a continual unea&s;ine&s;s, or el&s;e terminate in a &s;eparation.</P>
<P>ENOUGH has now been &s;aid, to convince all who could entertain any doubt, that the profe&s;&s;ion of the go&s;pel mini&s;try is nece&s;&s;arily attended with difficulties, and &s;ubjects us to peculiar afflictions and trials. If I &s;hould &s;ay that mo&s;t of the&s;e ideas are the re&s;ult of <HI>my own</HI> experience, I am &s;ure that many of my fath|ers and brethren, who hear me, can from <HI>their</HI> expe|rience te&s;tify to the truth of them. Others might be mentioned with as much propriety as any of the&s;e; but it mu&s;t be &s;ufficiently apparent that the exhorta|tion in the text is of very important u&s;e, <HI>Be thou partaker of the afflictions of the go&s;pel.</HI> Two ideas &s;eem to be implied in this exhortation; <HI>one</HI> is, that we do not &s;uffer alone, but are partakers with each other in the&s;e afflictions; the <HI>other</HI> is, that we &s;hould have our minds prepared for them, &s;o as not to be di&s;appointed or di&s;couraged. If we &s;uffer in company with our fath|ers and brethren, we have the benefit of their exam|ple and of their advice; and it is a con&s;olation to us to reflect that we are partakers with the be&s;t of men in the&s;e trials and difficulties. This con&s;ideration will help to prepare our minds to receive them, and keep us from &s;inking under them. But there is another motive &s;ugge&s;ted by the Apo&s;tle, which merits our particular attention. Be thou partaker of the afflic|tions of the go&s;pel, <HI>according to the power of God.</HI></P>
<P>LET us then inquire, why, and in what &s;en&s;e, the <HI>power of God</HI> is given as a rea&s;on of the exhortation in the text.</P>
<P>IN the preceding ver&s;es the Apo&s;tle had repre&s;ented the divine power as part of the gift which Timothy
<PB N="21" REF="030052_0019_0FE418015FE95790">
had received; "Stir up the <HI>gift</HI> that is in thee, by the putting on of my hands, for God hath not <HI>given</HI> us the &s;pirit of fear, but of <HI>power,</HI> and love, and a &s;ound mind." By which we learn, that a &s;pirit of power is reckoned among the mini&s;terial gifts, and nece&s;&s;ary to the di&s;charge of the mini&s;terial office. The mean|ing of this, as far as it re&s;pects the ordinary mini&s;ters of the church, I take to be, that the Holy Spirit is al|ways ready, with his powerful influence, to &s;upport and comfort the mini&s;ters of the word; to communi|cate to them all the energy, boldne&s;s and patience which they need, to enable them to bear the trials, and go through the duties of their important &s;tation; and the recollection of the gift received in their ordina|tion or appointment to this office, the gift of a <HI>&s;pirit of power,</HI> will &s;o put them and continue them in the way of their duty, as that they may confidently rely on the aid of the divine &s;pirit, for their &s;upport. Chri&s;t has promi&s;ed to be with his mini&s;ters to the end of the world; and when they are engaged with re&s;olution and fidelity in his &s;ervice, he who has a feeling of their infirmities, and is ever attentive to their wants and reque&s;ts, will enable them, by his power, to per&s;evere in the way of their duty, and &s;o far to overcome all the oppo&s;ition which may be made again&s;t them, as that the cau&s;e of truth &s;hall, on the whole, pro&s;per in their hands, and be promot|ed by their mini&s;try.</P>
<P>IN humble reliance, therefore, on this divine power, we &s;hould &s;et our&s;elves re&s;olutely and earne&s;tly about our Ma&s;ter's work, and not be moved from our &s;ted|fa&s;tne&s;s by any of the afflictions of the go&s;pel. For if we have a proper faith in this power; and a proper knowledge of the manner in which it is conveyed, and has been exerci&s;ed, we &s;hall be &s;atisfied that it is &s;ufficient for the purpo&s;e for which it is given.</P>
<P>AND here, we may, with propriety, look back to the primitive times of Chri&s;tianity, and &s;ee how this
<PB N="22" REF="030052_0020_0FE41760238AC528">
divine power was manife&s;ted in &s;upporting the fir&s;t preachers of the go&s;pel, in times of far greater diffi|culty than the pre&s;ent. They had to encounter the mo&s;t fierce and formidable oppo&s;ition from inveterate prejudices, from malicious pa&s;&s;ions, from over-heated zeal, and from a combination of powerful intere&s;ts. They had to travel among all &s;orts of people, civilized and &s;avage, learned and unlearned, by &s;ea and by land, without any certain temporal revenues or means of &s;upport. They had to preach a new doctrine, and introduce a rational and &s;imple form of wor&s;hip, in defiance of ancient &s;uper&s;tition, the craft of prie&s;ts, the eloquence of orators, the authority of magi&s;trates, and the policy of princes. The per&s;ons employed in this &s;ervice were in general illiterate, void of art, actuated by an hone&s;t regard to their duty. They were fully convinced them&s;elves of the truth of what they re|ported, but were de&s;titute of tho&s;e natural and exter|nal advantages, which human wi&s;dom would deem nece&s;&s;ary to introduce a new religion, and recommend it to the notice and e&s;teem of the world. Yet they went out on their arduous and benevolent work with|out fear; they per&s;evered in it with wi&s;dom and bold|ne&s;s, and they were greatly &s;ucce&s;sful in their en|deavours to promote the cau&s;e of their Ma&s;ter, and &s;ubdue the hearts of men to the obedience of the truth. And to what means can this remarkable &s;uc|ce&s;s be a&s;cribed, but to a divine <HI>power,</HI> upholding and &s;upporting them, and co-operating with their exertions to produce this mighty effect. To this cau&s;e, the Apo&s;tles them&s;elves a&s;cribe it. "Our go&s;pel came to you not in word only, but in <HI>power,</HI> and in the Holy Gho&s;t, and in much a&s;&s;urance." "My preaching was not with enticing words of man's wi&s;dom, but in demon&s;tration of the &s;pirit, and of <HI>power.</HI>"</P>
<P>SOME may think, that in the idea of this power, might have been comprehended the gift of miracles, by which they were enabled to make a direct appeal
<PB N="23" REF="030052_0021_0FE41761D1530730">
to the &s;en&s;es of mankind, and prove that they had an extraordinary commi&s;&s;ion from God. But this was a temporary thing. There is a power accompanying go&s;pel preaching, di&s;tinct from the gift of miracles; a power, by which they were &s;upported in the exer|ci&s;e of their office, and by which their preaching was rendered effectual to the end for which it was appoint|ed. This was a divine energy, communicated to them, by which they were &s;trengthened and animated to go on boldly and courageou&s;ly with their Ma&s;ter's work, in defiance of all the oppo&s;ition which the world could throw in their way. It is not ea&s;y to de&s;cribe this energy but by its effect; and of this we have a remarkable in&s;tance, in the different conduct of Peter, before and after he was endowed with the &s;pirit of power. Before our Lord's death, we find this for|ward, &s;anguine di&s;ciple, failing of his duty in a mo&s;t &s;hameful manner. One hour profe&s;&s;ing, "Though all men &s;hould for&s;ake thee, yet will I never for&s;ake thee;" "Though I &s;hould die with thee, yet I will not deny thee;" and the next, denying that he knew his Ma&s;ter; and when clo&s;ely pre&s;&s;ed on the &s;ubject, adding oaths and cur&s;es to confirm the denial. We find him afraid not only of the high-prie&s;t and rulers, but even of their &s;ervants; and though he &s;eemed to recover from this fall, and &s;hed tears of remor&s;e for his folly, yet, when his Lord was actually led to ex|ecution, he was one of tho&s;e who for&s;ook him, and fled. This was an affecting in&s;tance of incon&s;tancy and timidity, which would &s;eem to have di&s;qualified Peter from being an Apo&s;tle of Chri&s;t, and a preacher of his go&s;pel. But, mark the difference in his conduct, after the de&s;cent of the Holy Gho&s;t upon him. Then he could declare to the Jewi&s;h multitude, "This Je&s;us, whom ye have taken, and with wicked hands have crucified and &s;lain, God hath rai&s;ed up, of which all we are witne&s;&s;es. God hath made the &s;ame Je&s;us both Lord and Chri&s;t." Then he could tell the Jew|i&s;h rulers, when a&s;&s;embled in council, "The God of
<PB N="24" REF="030052_0022_0FE4180844206198">
our fathers hath rai&s;ed up Je&s;us, whom ye &s;lew, and hanged on a tree." And when he and his brother John were forbidden, by the Jewi&s;h council, to preach in the name of Je&s;us, he could boldly an&s;wer, "We ought to obey God rather than Men." Here we have a complete &s;pecimen of the effect of that &s;pirit of power, with which the primitive mini&s;ters were en|dowed; which enabled them to per&s;evere with a holy fortitude in confe&s;&s;ing Chri&s;t before men, who were enraged again&s;t them, and thir&s;ted for their blood. We &s;ee that this power can make the feeble &s;trong, and transform the coward into a hero.</P>
<P>WITH this &s;pirit of power, all the true mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t are endowed. It was not like the gift of mir|acles, confined to the primitive age; but it is diffu&s;ed univer&s;ally. Every mini&s;ter of Je&s;us Chri&s;t has, or may have, a &s;hare of it; and, were it not for this, it would be impo&s;&s;ible for us to &s;upport our character, or endure the trials and afflictions to which we are &s;ubject, and which will befal us in the cour&s;e of our mini&s;try. Were it not for this, we &s;hould &s;ink under the burden of our labours and &s;ufferings; or el&s;e, for&s;ake the &s;ervice of Chri&s;t, and, like Demas, &s;eek our portion and enjoyment in the things of this vain world. The Apo&s;tle, therefore, wi&s;ely refers to this divine energy, as the proper ground of encourage|ment to Timothy, in partaking of the afflictions of the go&s;pel. He knew that there was a &s;pirit of power in him, and communicated to him by his divine Ma&s;|ter, which would uphold and &s;upport him in affliction and tribulation; which would enable him to endure hardne&s;s as a good &s;oldier of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and carry him &s;afely and honourably through his chri&s;tian warfare. The &s;ame ground of comfort there is to every faithful &s;ervant of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. We are exhorted, therefore, to be partakers of the afflictions of the go&s;pel, accord|ing to the power of God. The&s;e afflictions are permit|ted to befal us by our wi&s;e and gracious Lord, who
<PB N="25" REF="030052_0023_0FE4176379437C20">
knows how to proportion our trials to our &s;trength; who, having given us a &s;pirit of power, gives us al&s;o opportunity to exerci&s;e it; that in much tribulation we may approve our&s;elves faithful to his cau&s;e, and diligent in his &s;ervice.</P>
<P>FROM what has now been ob&s;erved, agreeable to the text, we may infer, the mi&s;take of tho&s;e per|&s;ons who affect to think the work of the go&s;pel mini&s;try an ea&s;y thing. It has been often &s;aid, by &s;u|perficial ob&s;ervers, that mini&s;ters lead an ea&s;y life, becau&s;e they do not work for their living, but are maintained by their people. Granting the premi&s;es to be true, yet the conclu&s;ion will not follow. If our Lord has excu&s;ed us from manual labour, and if our people comply ever &s;o well with his directions in &s;up|porting us, yet he mu&s;t be a great &s;tranger to the du|ties of the mini&s;try, who thinks our work ea&s;y, and that we have not bu&s;ine&s;s enough to give us full em|ployment.</P>
<P>IT is a fact, confirmed by long and repeated expe|rience, that the work which we are obliged to do, and the trials which we are called to endure, are more wa&s;ting to the health and &s;pirits than any kind of bodily labour which men u&s;ually perform. Ex|erci&s;e of body tends to confirm and e&s;tabli&s;h the health; but the exerci&s;e of the mind, which falls to our lot, often proves ruinous to the health, and wears away the con&s;titution in a mo&s;t unaccountable man|ner. The thoughtfulne&s;s, the watchfulne&s;s, the &s;elf-denial, the anxiety, the clo&s;e application, and inten&s;e &s;tretch of the mental powers in deep &s;tudy and con|templation, which form an e&s;&s;ential part of our work, are exerci&s;es unknown to the bulk of mankind. If, on any particular occa&s;ion, they are called to &s;uch kind of labour, how painful and tedious is it to them, and how eagerly do they embrace the fir&s;t opportu|nity to get rid of it! But it is our con&s;tant employ|ment. The inward labour of our mind, our conflicts
<PB N="26" REF="030052_0024_0FE41809F5BAE5E8">
with our own corruptions, and our application to &s;acred &s;tudies, are objects which the world does not &s;ee, and therefore can form no idea of them. Our public di&s;cour&s;es are the re&s;ult of deep thought and &s;trict inquiry; and yet how often does it happen that tho&s;e di&s;cour&s;es are lea&s;t regarded; whil&s;t the tin&s;el trumpery of him "that beateth the air" is admired as the perfection of wi&s;dom and rhetoric! the beaten oil of the &s;anctuary is quickly con&s;umed, and its light appears to have been &s;pent in vain! whil&s;t the twink|ling of an <HI>ignis fatuus</HI> &s;hall draw after it crouds of admirers! If our brethren did but know the labour, the patience, the &s;elf application, the trials and di&s;|couragements, which fall to our lot, they would pity us, and pray for us, rather than think our work light and ea&s;y.</P>
<P>BUT notwith&s;tanding all the&s;e trials and di&s;courage|ments, yet we are not without our &s;hare of comfort; there are con&s;olations, as well as afflictions, of the go&s;|pel; and he who hath appointed us to the one, knows how to impart to us the other. His grace is &s;ufficient for us, and his &s;trength is made perfect in our weak|ne&s;s. The Apo&s;tle Paul could &s;ay, "Ble&s;&s;ed be God, even the Father of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort, who comfort|eth us in all our tribulation, that we may be able to comfort them who are in any trouble, by the comfort with which we our&s;elves are comforted of God; for as the &s;ufferings of Chri&s;t abound in us, &s;o our con|&s;olation al&s;o aboundeth by Chri&s;t." And I doubt not, my <HI>fathers</HI> and <HI>brethren,</HI> that as ye have been par|takers of the afflictions, &s;o ye have al&s;o been partakers of the con&s;olations of the go&s;pel. If &s;ome per&s;ons have been in&s;tructed, converted, and edified by our mini&s;try, the knowledge which we have of the&s;e good effects, wrought in the minds of our hearers, affords us proportionable &s;atisfaction, that we have not wholly laboured in vain. God often gives us to &s;ee
<PB N="27" REF="030052_0025_0FE41767AFAB7DC0">
&s;ome good fruit produced by our mini&s;try; and though we &s;ee not &s;o much as we could wi&s;h, yet we may have been in&s;trumental of doing more good than ever has, or ever will, actually come to our knowl|edge in this world. The hu&s;bandman, in the para|ble, is repre&s;ented as &s;owing his &s;eed, and &s;leeping and ri&s;ing night and day, while the &s;eed &s;prings and grows up <HI>he knoweth not how;</HI> &s;o it is our duty to keep our|&s;elves employed in our mini&s;terial labours, leaving the &s;ucce&s;s of them to the &s;ecret, imperceptible influence of divine truth, which operates not by external might or power, but by the &s;pirit of him who has free and perfect acce&s;s to the human heart at all times. We &s;ee a fountain pouring out con&s;tant &s;treams of water for ages, and yet now and then only &s;ome thir&s;ty per&s;on comes to drink. From the analogy between natural and &s;piritual objects we may learn that God's word will not return to him void, but &s;hall accom|pli&s;h the purpo&s;e for which it is &s;ent; and though only now and then &s;ome thir&s;ty &s;inner comes to drink, yet we &s;hould rejoice that the water of life has not been flowing in vain.</P>
<P>IF we are faithful in our Ma&s;ter's &s;ervice, though we may be de&s;pi&s;ed by the thoughtle&s;s and profane, yet we &s;hall be re&s;pected by the wi&s;e and good; we &s;hall have &s;uch a &s;hare of influence over mankind as we may u&s;e to their advantage, both in a moral and political view; and we &s;hall receive &s;uch outward tokens of friend&s;hip as will help to &s;upport us, and keep our courage from failing even in the mo&s;t diffi|cult trials. Though we &s;ow in tears, we &s;hall reap in joy; and at the great harve&s;t-day, and not before, we &s;hall &s;ee the <HI>whole</HI> fruit of our labour, to our abundant &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>MY brethren, of this <HI>whole</HI> congregation, you have heard &s;ome enumeration of the afflictions of the go&s;|pel; and among them, the want of a competent tem|poral &s;upport, which often falls to the lot of its min|i&s;ters
<PB N="28" REF="030052_0026_0FE4176A8B790AD0">
and their families. It has been the laudable practice of this convention, for many years, and it may be ju&s;tly reckoned the <HI>be&s;t</HI> part of our bu&s;ine&s;s at the&s;e annual meetings, to contribute to the relief of the widows and orphans of our decea&s;ed brethren, who are &s;ometimes left in de&s;titute circum&s;tances. This is a &s;pecies of con&s;olation which it is in every one's power to admini&s;ter in &s;ome degree; and if it be ever &s;o &s;mall, it will be accepted by him who hath &s;aid, "He that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet &s;hall receive a prophet's reward; and he that receiveth a righteous man in the name of a righteous man &s;hall receive a righteous man's reward; and who&s;oever &s;hall give to one of the&s;e little ones that believe in me, a cup of cold water only, in the name of a di&s;ciple, verily I &s;ay to you, he &s;hall in no wi&s;e lo&s;e his reward."</P>
<P>IF the time would allow, I might urge your atten|tion to this part of duty by a variety of con&s;iderations; but there is one, which I cannot omit, becau&s;e I think it is founded in fact, and yet has not, perhaps, been &s;o much attended to as it de&s;erves. It is well known, that many of our order have but a &s;mall income; it is al&s;o well known, that many of our families make a decent appearance, both at home and abroad. To what cau&s;e can this be owing, but to a principle of <HI>oeconomy,</HI> which is, I believe, generally, a characteri&s;tic of our families? I do not mean to &s;peak without ex|ception, becau&s;e it would not be con&s;i&s;tent with truth. This principle, being once formed into habit, is not ea&s;ily lo&s;t; but when the wife becomes a widow, and the children orphans, it is of un&s;peakable advantage to them.</P>
<P>IT is al&s;o well known, that our brethren are gener|ally di&s;po&s;ed to give their children a good education. Having no pro&s;pect of leaving them an inheritance, and being &s;en&s;ible of the great advantage of education, and the great di&s;advantage of a &s;tate of dependence,
<PB N="29" REF="030052_0027_0FE4180BA44B3AB0">
they are earne&s;t to put their children into a way of being able to get their own living independently, and, at the &s;ame time, of being u&s;eful to the community. The good effect of the&s;e cau&s;es is vi&s;ible in every part of the country, and this town contains &s;ome valuable examples of it. Take a general view of our citizens, and you will find, or by inquiry you may &s;oon be in|formed of the &s;ons of clergymen, who make a capital figure in all the departments of bu&s;ine&s;s. You will &s;ee them among our mo&s;t active and enterpri&s;ing mer|chants, and our mo&s;t indu&s;trious and reputable trade&s;|men. You will &s;ee them &s;hine, at the bar, on the bench, in the medical faculty, in the pulpit, in our legi&s;lative a&s;&s;emblies; and even the chief &s;eat of our government was lately filled with a gentleman of this de&s;cription. Look into the female line, and you will find among the daughters of clergymen &s;ome of the brighte&s;t ornaments of the &s;ex.</P>
<P>WHEN the&s;e things are con&s;idered, you will permit me to &s;ay, that in &s;oliciting charity for the widows and orphans of my brethren, I am pleading the cau&s;e, not of tho&s;e who are too proud or too lazy to work, but of tho&s;e who, with a little a&s;&s;i&s;tance, in their pre&s;|ent circum&s;tances, may, in time, become ornaments of their country, and pillars of church and &s;tate.</P>
<P>TO conclude. Let us never be weary in well-doing. We &s;erve a good Ma&s;ter, and we cannot &s;erve him too much; he is a vigilant ob&s;erver of our conduct, and he views not only the outward appearance, but the heart. Let &s;incerity and uprightne&s;s, then, govern our whole deportment. Let us be ready to every good work; and we &s;hall find, by our own experi|ence, that in &s;erving God, we are &s;erving our&s;elves; and that in &s;uffering according to his will, we are promoting our own true happine&s;s, both here and hereafter.</P>
