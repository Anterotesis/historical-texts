<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>THE French Revolution is at la&s;t not only accompli&s;hed, but its accompli&s;hment univer&s;ally acknowledged, beyond contradiction abroad, or the power of retraction at home.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The reader will bear in mind that this was written in the latter end of the year 1791, ju&s;t as the French had e&s;tabli&s;hed their fir&s;t con&s;titution, and were determined to try the experiment of a lim|ited monarchy. It is in this &s;en&s;e that the author con&s;idered the revolution as fini&s;hed; though he did not believe, as will appear in this introduction, that a government &s;o con&s;tructed, and &s;o little con|genial to the &s;pirit of the times, would be of long duration.</P>
<P>He did not believe in the nece&s;&s;ity of a war to in|troduce and e&s;tabli&s;h the republic. For though the treaty of Pilnitz had then been publi&s;hed, and though it bore the marks of that folly which is common to the enemies of reform in all ages, &s;till it does not appear from any &s;ub&s;equent events, that the parties to that treaty had any intention of pu&s;h|ing their oppo&s;ition to open ho&s;tilities. This opin|ion is more fully developed in the preface to <HI>The Con&s;piracy of Kings,</HI> and in the note on Mr. Burke, at the end of the volume.</P></NOTE> It has fini&s;hed its work, by organizing a government, on principles approved by rea&s;on; an object long contemplated by different writers, but never before exhibited, in this quarter of the globe. The experiment now
<PB N="iv" REF="030026_0003_0FE400914022E598">
in operation will &s;olve a que&s;tion of the fir&s;t mag|nitude in human affairs: Whether <HI>Theory</HI> and <HI>Practice,</HI> which always agree together in things of &s;lighter moment, are really to remain eternal ene|mies in the highe&s;t concerns of men?</P>
<P>The change of government in France is, pro|perly &s;peaking, a renovation of &s;ociety; an object peculiarly fitted to hurry the mind into a field of thought, which can &s;carcely be limited by the con|cerns of a nation, or the improvements of an age. As there is a tendency in human nature to imita|tion; and as all the apparent cau&s;es exi&s;t in mo&s;t of the governments of the world, to induce the peo|ple to wi&s;h for a &s;imilar change; it becomes inter|e&s;ting to the cau&s;e of humanity, to take a delibe|rate view of the real nature and extent of this change, and find what are the advantages and di&s;|advantages to be expected from it.</P>
<P>There is not that necromancy in politics, which prevents our fore&s;eeing, with tolerable certainty, what is to be the re&s;ult of operations &s;o univer&s;al, in which all the people concur. Many truths are as perceptible when fir&s;t pre&s;ented to the mind, as an age or a world of experience could make them; others require only an indirect and collateral experience; &s;ome demand an experience direct and po&s;itive.</P>
<P><PB N="v" REF="030026_0004_0FE40093D6E0F6D0">It is happy for human nature, that in morals we have much to do with this fir&s;t cla&s;s of truths, le&s;s with the &s;econd, and very little with the third; while in phy&s;ics we are perpetually driven to the &s;low proce&s;s of patient and po&s;itive experience.</P>
<P>The Revolution in France certainly comes re|commended to us under one a&s;pect which renders it at fir&s;t view extremely inviting: it is the work of argument and rational conviction, not of the &s;word. The <HI>ultima ratio regum</HI> had nothing to do with it. It was an operation de&s;igned for the be|nefit of the people; it originated in the people, and was conducted by the people. It had therefore a legitimate origin; and this circum&s;tance entitles it to our &s;erious contemplation, on two accounts: becau&s;e there is &s;omething venerable in the idea, and becau&s;e other nations, in &s;imilar circum&s;tances, will certainly be di&s;po&s;ed to imitate it.</P>
<P>I &s;hall therefore examine the nature and con&s;e|quences of a &s;imilar revolution in government, as it will affect the following principal objects, which make up the affairs of nations in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of Europe:
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. The Feudal Sy&s;tem,</ITEM>
<ITEM>II. The Church,</ITEM>
<ITEM>III. The Military,</ITEM>
<ITEM>IV. The Admini&s;tration of Ju&s;tice,</ITEM>
<ITEM>V. Revenue and public expenditure.</ITEM>

<P>It mu&s;t be of va&s;t importance to all the cla&s;&s;es of &s;ociety, as it now &s;tands cla&s;&s;ed in Europe, to cal|culate before-hand what they are to gain or to loo&s;e by the approaching change; that, like prudent &s;tock-jobbers, they may buy in or &s;ell out, accord|ing as this great event &s;hall affect them.</P>
<P>Philo&s;ophers and contemplative men, who may think them&s;elves di&s;intere&s;ted &s;pectators of &s;o great

a political drama, will do well to con&s;ider how far the cata&s;trophe is to be beneficial or detrimental to the human race; in order to determine whether in con&s;cience they ought to promote or di&s;courage, accelerate or retard it, by the publication of their opinions. It is true, the work was &s;et on foot by this &s;ort of men; but they have not all been of the &s;ame opinion relative to the be&s;t organization of the governing power, or how far the reform of abu&s;es ought to extend. Monte&s;quieu. Voltaire, and many other re&s;pectable authorities, have ac|credited the principle, that republicani&s;m is not convenient for a great &s;tate. Others take no no|tice of the di&s;tinction between great and &s;mall &s;tates, in deciding, that this is the only govern|ment proper to en&s;ure the happine&s;s, and &s;upport the dignity of man. Of the former opinion was a great majority of the con&s;tituant national a&s;&s;em|bly of France. Probably not many years will pa&s;s, before a third opinion will be univer&s;ally adopted, never to be laid a&s;ide: That the republi|can principle is not only proper and &s;afe for the government of any people; but that its propriety and &s;afety are in proportion to the magnitude of the &s;ociety and extent of the territory.</P>
<P>Among &s;incere enquirers after truth, all gener|al que&s;tions on this &s;ubject reduce them&s;elves to this: Whether men are to perform their duties by an ea&s;y choice or an expen&s;ive cheat; or, whe|ther our rea&s;on be given us to be improved or &s;ti|fled, to render us greater or le&s;s than brutes, to increa&s;e our happine&s;s or aggravate our mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>Among tho&s;e who&s;e anxieties ari&s;e only from intere&s;t, the inquiry is, how their privileges or their profe&s;&s;ions are to be affected by the new order of things. The&s;e form a cla&s;s of men re&s;pectable

both for their numbers and &s;en&s;ibility; it is our duty to attend to their ca&s;e. I &s;incerely hope to admini&s;ter &s;ome con&s;olation to them in the cour&s;e of this e&s;&s;ay. And though I have a better opinion of their philanthrophy, than political opponents generally entertain of each other, yet I do not al|together rely upon their pre&s;umed &s;ympathy with their fellow-citizens, and their &s;uppo&s;ed willing|ne&s;s to &s;acrifice to the public good; but I hope to convince them, that the e&s;tabli&s;hment of general liberty will be le&s;s injurious to tho&s;e who now live by abu&s;es, than is commonly imagined; that protected indu&s;try will produce effects far more a&s;|toni&s;hing than have ever been calculated; that the increa&s;e of enjoyments will be &s;uch, as to amelio|rate the condition of every human creature.</P>
<P>To per&s;uade this cla&s;s of mankind, that it is neither their duty nor their intere&s;t to endeavour to perpetuate the ancient forms of government, would be an high and holy office; it would be the great|e&s;t act of charity to them, as it might teach them to avoid a danger that is otherwi&s;e unavoidable; it would preclude the occa&s;ion of the people's indul|ging what is &s;ometimes called a ferocious di&s;po&s;i|tion, which is apt to grow upon the revenge of injuries, and render them le&s;s harmonious in their new &s;tation of citizens; it would prevent the civil wars, which might attend the in&s;urrections of the people, where there &s;hould be a great want of una|nimity,&mdash;for we are not to expect in every country that mildne&s;s and dignity which have uniformly characterized the French, even in their mo&s;t tu|multuous movements<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Whatever rea&s;on may be given for the fact, I believe all tho&s;e who have been witne&s;&s;es of what are called <HI>mobs</HI> in France (during the revolution) will join with me in opinion, that they are by no means to be compared with Engli&s;h mobs, in point of indi&s;criminate ferocity and private plunder. A popular commotion in Paris was uniformly directed to a certain well-explained object; from which it never was known to deviate. Whether this object were to hang a man, to arre&s;t the king, to intimidate the court, or to break the furniture of a hotel, all other per&s;ons and all other property, that fell in the way of the mob, were perfectly &s;afe.</P>
<P>The truth is, tho&s;e collections were compo&s;ed of hone&s;t and indu&s;trious people, who had nothing in view but the public good. They believed that the cau&s;e of their country required an execution of ju&s;|tice more prompt than could be expected from any e&s;tabli&s;hed tribunal. Be&s;ides, they were in the cri&s;is of a revolution, when they were &s;en&s;ible, that the crimes of their enemies would remain unpuni&s;h|ed, for want of a known rule by which they could be judged. Though a violation of <HI>right,</HI> is not always a violation of <HI>law</HI>; yet, in their opinion, occa&s;ions might exi&s;t, when it would be dangerous to let it pa&s;s with impunity.</P>
<P>It is indeed to be hoped, that whenever mobs in other countries &s;hall be animated by the &s;ame cau&s;e, they will conduct them&s;elves with the &s;ame dignity; and that this &s;ingular phenomenon will be found not altogether attributable to national character.</P></NOTE>; it would remove every

ob&s;tacle and every danger that may &s;eem to attend that rational &s;y&s;tem of public felicity to which the nations of Europe are moving with rapid &s;trides, and which in pro&s;pect is &s;o con&s;oling to the en|lightened friends of humanity.</P>
<P>To induce the men who now govern the world to adopt the&s;e ideas, is the duty of tho&s;e who now

po&s;&s;e&s;s them. I confe&s;s the ta&s;k, at fir&s;t view, ap|pears more than Herculean; it will be thought an object from which the eloquence of the clo&s;et mu&s;t &s;hrink in de&s;pair, and which prudence would leave to the more powerful arguments of events. But I believe at the &s;ame time that &s;ome &s;ucce&s;s may be expected; that though the harve&s;t be great, the labourers may not be few; that prejudce and in|tere&s;t cannot always be relied on to garri&s;on the mind again&s;t the a&s;&s;aults of truth. This belief, ill-grounded as it may appear, is &s;ufficient to ani|mate me in the cau&s;e; and to the venerable ho&s;t of republican writers, who have preceeded me in the di&s;cu&s;&s;ions occa&s;ioned by the French revolution, this belief is my only apology for offering to join the fraternity, and for thus practically declaring my opinion, that they have not exhau&s;ted the &s;ub|ject.</P>
<P>Two very powerful weapons, the force of rea|&s;on and the force of numbers, are in the hands of the political reformers. While the u&s;e of the fir&s;t brings into action the &s;econd, and en&s;ures its co|operation, it remains a &s;acred duty, impo&s;ed on them by the God of rea&s;on to wield with dexterity this mild and beneficent weapon, before recurring to the u&s;e of the other; which, though legitimate, may be le&s;s harmle&s;s; though infallible in opera|tion, may be le&s;s glorious in victory.</P>
<P>The tyrannies of the world, whatever be the ap|pellation of the government under which they are exerci&s;ed, are all ari&s;tocratical tyrannies. An or|dinance to plunder and murder, whether it fulmi|nate from the Vatican, or &s;teal &s;ilently forth from the Harem; whether it come clothed in the <HI>certain &s;cience</HI> of a Bed of Ju&s;tice, or in the legal &s;olemni|ties of a bench of lawyers; whether it be purcha|&s;ed

by the care&s;&s;es of a woman, or the trea&s;ures of a nation;&mdash;never confines its effects to the benefit of a &s;ingle individual; it goes to enrich the whole combination of con&s;pirators, who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s it is to dupe and to govern the nation. It carries its own bribery with it&s;elf through all its progre&s;s and con|nexions,&mdash;in its origination, in its enaction, in its vindication, in its execution; it is a fertilizing &s;tream, that waters and vivifies its happy plants in the numerous channel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of its communication. Mi|ni&s;ters and &s;ecretaries, commanders of armies, contractors, collectors and tide-waiters, intendants, judges and lawyers,&mdash;whoever is permitted to drink of the &s;alutary &s;tream,&mdash;are all intere&s;ted in removing the ob&s;tructions and in prai&s;ing the foun|tain from which it flows.</P>
<P>The &s;tate of human nature requires that this &s;hould be the ca&s;e. Among beings &s;o nearly equal in power and capacity as men of the &s;ame commu|nity are, it is impo&s;&s;ible that a &s;olitary tyrant &s;hould exi&s;t. Laws that are de&s;igned to operate unequal|ly on &s;ociety, mu&s;t offer an exclu&s;ive intere&s;t to a con&s;iderable portion of its members, to en&s;ure their execution upon the re&s;t. Hence has ari&s;en the nece&s;&s;ity of that &s;trange complication in the governing power, which has made of politics an inexpliclable &s;cience; hence the rea&s;on for arming one cla&s;s of our fellow creatures with the weapons of bodily de&s;truction, and another with the my&s;te|rious artillery of the vengeance of heaven; hence the cau&s;e of what in England is called the indepen|dence of the judges, and what on the continent has created a judiciary nobility, a &s;et of men who pur|cha&s;e the privilege of being the profe&s;&s;ional ene|mies of the people, of &s;elling their deci&s;ions to the rich, and of di&s;tributing individual oppre&s;&s;ion;
<PB N="xi" REF="030026_0010_0FE400B24750B9F8">
hence the &s;ource of tho&s;e Draconian codes of cri|minal juri&s;prudence which en&s;hrine the idol pro|perty in a bloody &s;anctuary, and teach the modern European, that his life is of le&s;s value than the &s;hoes on his feet; hence the po&s;itive di&s;courage|ments laid upon agriculture, manufacture, com|merce, and every method of improving the condi|tion of men; for it is to be ob&s;erved, that in every country the &s;hackles impo&s;ed upon indu&s;try are in proportion to the degree of general de&s;poti&s;m that reigns in the government. This ari&s;es not only from the greater debility and want of enterpri&s;e in the people, but from the &s;uperior nece&s;&s;ity that &s;uch governments are under, to prevent their &s;ub|jects from acquiring that ea&s;e and information, by which they could di&s;cern the evil and apply the remedy.</P>
<P>To the &s;ame fruitful &s;ource of calamities we are to trace that perver&s;ity of rea&s;on, which, in governments where men are permitted to di&s;cu&s;s political &s;ubjects, has given ri&s;e to tho&s;e perpetual &s;hifts of &s;ophi&s;try, by which they vindicate the pre|rogative of kings. In one age it is the <HI>right of conque&s;t,</HI> in another <HI>the divine right,</HI> then it comes to be a <HI>compact between king and people,</HI> and la&s;t of all, it is &s;aid to be founded on general convenience, <HI>the good of the whole community.</HI> In England the&s;e &s;everal arguments have all had their day; though it is a&s;toni&s;hing that the two former could ever have been the &s;ubjects of rational debate: the fir&s;t is the logic of the mu&s;quet, and the &s;econd of the chalice; the one was buried at Rennimede on the &s;ignature of Magna Charta, the other took its flight to the continent with James the Second. The compact of king and people has lain dor|mant

the greater part of the pre&s;ent century; till it was rou&s;ed from &s;lumber by the French revo|lution, and came into the &s;ervice of Mr. Burke.</P>
<P>Ha&s;ty men di&s;cover their errors when it is too late. It had certainly been much more con&s;i&s;tent with the temperament of that writer's mind, and quite as &s;erviceable to his cau&s;e, to have recalled the fugitive claim of the divine right of kings. It would have given a my&s;tic force to his declama|tion, afforded him many new epithets, and furni&s;h|ed &s;ubjects perfectly accordant with the copious charges of <HI>&s;acrilege, athei&s;m, murders, a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inations, rapes</HI> and <HI>plunders</HI> with which his three volumes abound.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The&s;e three works are, his <HI>Reflections on the Revolution in France,</HI> his <HI>Letter to a Member of the National A&s;&s;embly,</HI> and his <HI>Appeal from the New to the Old Whigs.</HI></NOTE> He then could not have di&s;appointed his friends by his total want of argument, as he now does in his two fir&s;t e&s;&s;ays; for on &s;uch a &s;ub|ject no argument could be expected; and in his third, where it is patiently attempted, he would have avoided the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;howing that he has none, by giving a different title to his book; for the "Appeal," in&s;tead of being "from the New to the Old Whigs," would have been <HI>from the new whigs to the old tories</HI>; and he might as well have appealed to Cae&s;ar; he could have found at this day no court to take cognizance of his cau&s;e.</P>
<P>But the great advantage of this mode of handling the &s;ubject would have been, that it could have provoked no an&s;wers; the gauntlet might have been thrown, without a champion to have taken it up; and the la&s;t &s;olitary admirer of chivalry have retired in negative triumph from the field.</P>
<P><PB N="xiii" REF="030026_0012_0FE400BC83707288">Mr. Burke, however, in his defence of royalty, does not rely on this argument of the compact. Whether it be, that he is con&s;cious of its futility, or that in his rage he forgets that he has u&s;ed it, he is perpetually recurring to the la&s;t ground that has yet been heard of, on which we are called up|on to con&s;ider kings even as a tolerable nui&s;ance, and to &s;upport the exi&s;ting forms of government: this ground is <HI>the general good of the community.</HI> It is &s;aid to be dangerous to pull down &s;y&s;tems that are already formed, or even to attempt to improve them; and it is likewi&s;e &s;aid, that, were they peaceably de&s;troyed, and we had &s;ociety to build up anew, it would be be&s;t to create hereditary kings, hereditary orders, and exclu&s;ive privileges.</P>
<P>The&s;e are &s;ober opinions, uniting a cla&s;s of rea|&s;oners too numerous and too re&s;pectable to be treated with contempt. I believe, however, that their number is every day dimini&s;hing, and I be|lieve the example which France will &s;oon be obli|ged to exhibit to the world on this &s;ubject, will induce every man to reject them, who is not per|&s;onally and exclu&s;ively intere&s;ted in their &s;upport.</P>
<P>The incon&s;i&s;tency of the the con&s;tituent a&s;&s;em|bly, in retaining an hereditary king, armed with an enormous civil li&s;t, to wage war with a popu|lar government, has induced &s;ome per&s;ons to pre|dict the downfall of their con&s;titution. But this mea&s;ure had a different origin from what is com|monly a&s;&s;igned to it, and will probably have a dif|ferent i&s;&s;ue. It was the re&s;ult rather of local and temporary circum&s;tances, than of any general be|lief in the utility of kings, under any modifica|tions or limitations that could be attached to the office.</P>
<P><PB N="xiv" REF="030026_0013_0FE400C24E1387E8">It is to be ob&s;erved, <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> that the French had a king upon their hands. This king had always been con&s;idered as a well-di&s;po&s;ed man; &s;o that, by a fatality &s;omewhat &s;ingular, though not unex|ampled in <HI>regal hi&s;tory,</HI> he gained the love of the people, almo&s;t in proportion to the mi&s;chief which he did them. <HI>Secondly,</HI> their king had very power|ful family connexions, in the &s;overeigns of Spain, Au&s;tria, Naples and Sardinia; be&s;ides his relations within the kingdom, whom it was nece&s;&s;ary to at|tach, if po&s;&s;ible, to the intere&s;ts of the community. <HI>Thirdly,</HI> the revolution was con&s;idered by all Eu|rope as a high and dangerous experiment. It was nece&s;&s;ary to hide as much as po&s;&s;ible the appearance of its magnitude from the eye of the di&s;tant ob|&s;erver. The reformers con&s;idered it as their duty to produce an internal regeneration of &s;ociety, rather than an external change in the appearance of the court; to &s;et in order the counting-hou&s;e and the kitchen, before arranging the drawing-room. This would leave the &s;overeigns of Eu|rope totally without a pretext for interfering; while it would be con&s;oling to that cla&s;s of phi|lo&s;ophers, who &s;till believed in the compatibility of royalty and liberty. <HI>Fourthly,</HI> this decree, That <HI>France &s;hould have a king,</HI> and that he <HI>could do no wrong,</HI> was pa&s;&s;ed at an early period of their operations; when the above rea&s;ons were appa|rently more urgent than they were afterwards, or probably will ever be again.</P>
<P>From the&s;e con&s;iderations we may conclude, that royalty is pre&s;erved in France for rea&s;ons which are fugitive; that a majory of the con&s;ti|tuent a&s;&s;embly did not believe in it, as an ab&s;tract principle; that a majority of the people will learn
<PB N="xv" REF="030026_0014_0FE400C7B6F273B8">
to be di&s;gue&s;ted with &s;o unnatural and ponderous a deformity in their new edifice, and will &s;oon hew it off.</P>
<P>After this improvement &s;hall have been made, a few years experience in the face of Europe, and on &s;o great a theatre as that of France, will pro|bably leave but one opinion in the minds of hone&s;t men, relative to the republican principle, or the great &s;implicity of nature applied to the organiza|tion of &s;ociety.</P>
<P>The example of America would have had great weight in producing this conviction; but it is too little known to the European rea&s;oner, to be a &s;ubject of accurate inve&s;tigation. Be&s;ides the dif|ference of circum&s;tances between that country and the &s;tates of Europe has given occa&s;ion for imagi|ning many di&s;tinctions which exi&s;t not in fact, and has prevented the application of principles which are permanently founded in nature, and follow not the trifling variations in the &s;tate of &s;ociety.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. I. FEUDAL SYSTEM.</HEAD>
<P>THE mo&s;t prominent feature in the moral face of Europe, was imprinted upon it by conque&s;t. It is the re&s;ult of the &s;ubordination nece&s;&s;ary among military &s;avages, on their becoming cultivators of the &s;oil which they had de&s;olated, and making an advantageous u&s;e of &s;uch of the inhabitants as they did not choo&s;e to ma&s;&s;acre, and could not &s;ell to foreigners for &s;laves.</P>
<P>The relation thus e&s;tabli&s;hed between the offi|cers and the &s;oldiers, between the victors and the van|qui&s;hed, and between them all and the lands which they were to cultivate, modified by the experience of unlettered ages, has obtained the name of the Feudal Sy&s;tem, and may be con&s;idered as the foun|dation of all the political in&s;titutions in this quar|ter of the world. The claims re&s;ulting to parti|cular cla&s;&s;es of men, under this modification of &s;ociety, are called Feudal Rights; and to the in|dividual po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors they are either nominal or real, conveying an empty title or a &s;ub&s;tantial profit.</P>
<P>My intention is not to enter on the details of this &s;y&s;tem, as a lawyer, or to trace its progre&s;s with the accuracy of an hi&s;torian, and &s;how its peculiar fitne&s;s to the rude ages of &s;ociety which
<PB N="18" REF="030026_0017_0FE400D64E08B660">
gave it birth. But, viewing it as an ancient edi|fice, who&s;e foundation, worn away by the current of events, can no longer &s;upport its weight, I would &s;ketch a few drawings to &s;how the &s;tile of its architecture, and compare it with the model of the new building to be erected in its place.</P>
<P>The <HI>philo&s;ophy</HI> of the Feudal Sy&s;tem, is all that remains of it worthy of our contemplation. This I will attempt to trace in &s;ome of its leading points, leaving the practical part to fall, with its ancient founders and its modern admirers, into the peace|ful gulph of oblivion; to which I wi&s;h it a &s;pee|dy and an unob&s;tructed pa&s;&s;age.</P>
<P>The original object of this in&s;titution was un|doubtedly, what it was alleged to be, the pre&s;er|vation of turbulent &s;ocieties, in which men are held together but by feeble ties; and it effected its purpo&s;e by uniting the per&s;onal intere&s;t of the head of each family, with the perpetual &s;afety of the &s;tate. Thus far the purpo&s;e was laudable, and the means extremely well calculated for the end. But it was the fortune of this &s;y&s;tem to attach it&s;elf to tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ions of human nature which vary not with the change of circum&s;tances. While national motives cea&s;ed by degrees to re|quire its continuance, family motives forbade to lay it a&s;ide. The &s;ame progre&s;&s;ive improvements in &s;ociety, which rendered military tenures and military titles fir&s;t unnece&s;&s;ary and then injurious to the general intere&s;t, at the &s;ame time &s;harpen|ed the avarice, and piqued the honour of tho&s;e who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them, to pre&s;erve the exclu&s;ive pri|vileges which rendered them thus di&s;tingui&s;hed. And the&s;e privileges, united with the operations of the church, have founded and &s;upported the
<PB N="19" REF="030026_0018_0FE400D9B4FC7400">
de&s;poti&s;ms of Europe in all their divi&s;ions, com|binations, and refinements.</P>
<P>Feudal Rights are either <HI>territorial</HI> or <HI>per&s;onal.</HI> I &s;hall divide them into the&s;e two cla&s;&s;es, for the &s;ake of be&s;towing a few ob&s;ervations upon each.</P>
<P>The pernicious effects of the &s;y&s;tem on territo|rial tenures are inconceivable, various and great. In a legal view, it has led to tho&s;e intricacies and vexations, which we find attached to every cir|cum&s;tance of real property, which have perplex|ed the &s;cience of civil juri&s;prudence, which have perpetuated the ignorance of the people relative to the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice, rendered nece&s;&s;ary the intervention of lawyers, and multiplied the means of oppre&s;&s;ion. But, in a political view, its con&s;equences are &s;till more &s;erious, and demand a particular con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t quality of the feudal tenure is to con|fine the de&s;cendible property to the <HI>elde&s;t male i&s;&s;ue.</HI> To &s;ay that this is contrary to nature, is but a feeble expre&s;&s;ion. So abominable is its ope|ration, that it has &s;educed and perverted nature; her voice is &s;tifled, intere&s;t it&s;elf is laid a&s;leep, and nothing but the eloquence of an incomprehen&s;ible pride is heard on the occa&s;ion. You will hear father and mother, younger brothers and &s;i&s;ters, rejoice in this provi&s;ion of the law; the former con&s;igning their daughters to the gloomy pri&s;on of a convent, and their younger &s;ons to the church or the army, to en&s;ure their celibacy; that no rem|nant of the family may remain but the heir of the e&s;tate entire; the latter congratulating each other, that the elder brother will tran&s;mit unimpaired the title and the property, while they them&s;elves are content to peri&s;h in the ob&s;curity of their &s;everal de&s;tinations. It is probable that, in another age,
<PB N="20" REF="030026_0019_0FE400DFD7F01510">
a tale of this kind will &s;carcely gain credit, and that the tear of &s;en&s;ibility may be &s;pared by a di&s;belief of the fact. It is, however, no creature of the imagination; it happened every day in France previous to the revolution; I have &s;een it with my own eyes, and heard it with my own ears; it is now to be &s;een and heard in mo&s;t other Catholic countries.</P>
<P>But other points of view &s;how this di&s;po&s;ition of the law to be &s;till more reprehen&s;ible in the eye of political philo&s;ophy. It &s;wells the inequality of wealth, which, even in the be&s;t regulated &s;ocie|ty, is but too con&s;iderable; it habituates the peo|ple to believe in an unnatural inequality in the rights of men, and by the&s;e means prepares them for &s;ervility and oppre&s;&s;ion; it prevents the im|provement of lands, and impedes the progre&s;s of indu&s;try and cultivation, which are be&s;t promoted on &s;mall e&s;tates, where proprietors cultivate for them&s;elves; it di&s;courages population, by indu|cing to a life of celibacy.&mdash;But I &s;hall &s;peak of celibacy when I &s;peak of the church.</P>
<P>Whether men are born to govern, or to obey, or to enjoy equal liberty, depends not on the ori|ginal capacity of the mind, but on the <HI>in&s;tinct of analogy,</HI> or the <HI>habit of thinking.</HI> When children of the &s;ame family are taught to believe in the un|conquerable di&s;tinctions of birth among them|&s;elves, they are completely fitted for a feudal go|vernment; becau&s;e their minds are familiari&s;ed with all the gradations and degradations that &s;uch a government requires. The birth-right of domi|neering is not more readily claimed on the one hand, than it is acknowledged on the other; and the Jamaica planter is not more habitually con|vinced
<PB N="21" REF="030026_0020_0FE400E479DA9F88">
that an European is &s;uperior to an African, than he is that a Lord is better than him&s;elf.</P>
<P>This &s;ubject de&s;erves to be placed in a light, in which no writer, as far as I know, has yet con&s;idered it. When a per&s;on was repeating to Fontenelle the common adage <HI>habit is the &s;econd nature,</HI> the philo&s;opher replied, <HI>and do me the fa|vour to tell me which is the fir&s;t.</HI> When we a&s;&s;ert that nature has e&s;tabli&s;hed <HI>inequalities</HI> among men, and has thus given to &s;ome the right of governing others, or when we maintain the <HI>contrary</HI> of this po&s;ition, we &s;hould be careful to define what &s;ort of nature we mean, whether the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> or <HI>&s;econd nature</HI>; or whether we mean that there is but one. A mere &s;avage, Colocolo<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the Araucana of Ercilla.</NOTE> for in&s;tance, would decide the que&s;tion of equality by a trial of bodi|ly &s;trength, de&s;ignating the man that could lift the heavie&s;t beam to be the legi&s;lator; and unle&s;s all men could lift the &s;ame beam, they could not be equal in their rights. Ari&s;totle would give the preference to him that excelled in mental ca|pacity. Uly&s;&s;es would make the deci&s;ion upon a compound ratio of both. But there appears to me another &s;tep in this ladder, and that the <HI>habit of thinking</HI> is the only &s;afe and univer&s;al criterion to which, in practice, the que&s;tion can be refer|red. Indeed, when intere&s;t is laid a&s;ide, it is the only one to which, in civilized ages, it ever is referred. We never &s;ubmit to a King, becau&s;e he is &s;tronger than we in bodily force, nor becau&s;e he is &s;uperior in under&s;tanding or in information; but becau&s;e we believe him born to govern, or at lea&s;t, becau&s;e a majority of the &s;ociety believes it.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="030026_0021_0FE3F128F5A75A00">This <HI>habit of thinking</HI> has &s;o much of nature in it, it is &s;o undi&s;tingui&s;hable from the indelible marks of the man, that it is a perfectly &s;afe foun|dation for any &s;y&s;tem that we may choo&s;e to build upon it; indeed it is the <HI>only</HI> foundation, for it is the only point of contact by which men commu|nicate as moral a&s;&s;ociates. As a practical po&s;ition therefore, and as relating to almo&s;t all places and almo&s;t all times, in which the experiment has yet been made, Ari&s;totle was as right in teaching, <HI>That &s;ome are born to command, and others to be commanded,</HI> as the National A&s;&s;embly was in de|claring, That <HI>men are born and always continue free and equal in re&s;pect to their rights.</HI> The latter is as apparently fal&s;e in the diet of Rati&s;bon, as the former is in the hall of the Jacobins.</P>
<P>Ab&s;tractly con&s;idered, there can be no doubt of the unchangeable truth of the a&s;&s;embly's de|claration; and they have taken the right method to make it a <HI>practical</HI> truth, by publi&s;hing it to the world for di&s;cu&s;&s;ion. A general belief <HI>that it is a truth,</HI> makes it at once practical, confirms it in one nation, and extends it to others.</P>
<P>A due attention to the a&s;toni&s;hing effects that are wrought in the world by <HI>the habit of thinking,</HI> will &s;erve many valuable purpo&s;es. I cannot therefore di&s;mi&s;s the &s;ubject &s;o &s;oon as I intended; but will mention one or two in&s;tances of the&s;e effects, and leave the reflection of the reader to make the application to a thou&s;and others.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> It is evident that all the arbitrary &s;y&s;tems in the world are founded and &s;upported on this <HI>&s;e|cond nature</HI> of man, in counteraction of the <HI>fir&s;t.</HI> Sy&s;tems which di&s;tort and cru&s;h and &s;ubjugate every thing that we can &s;uppo&s;e original and cha|racteri&s;tic in man, as an undi&s;torted being. It
<PB N="23" REF="030026_0022_0FE400ED5D956CE0">
&s;u&s;tains the mo&s;t ab&s;urd and abominable theories of religion, and honours them with as many mar|tyrs as it does tho&s;e that are the mo&s;t peaceful and beneficent.</P>
<P>But <HI>&s;econdly,</HI> we find for our con&s;olation, that it will likewi&s;e &s;upport &s;y&s;tems of equal liberty and national happine&s;s. In the United States of Ame|rica, the &s;cience of liberty is univer&s;ally under|&s;tood, felt, and practi&s;ed, as much by the &s;imple as the wi&s;e, the weak as the &s;trong. Their deep-rooted and inveterate habit of thinking is, that <HI>all men are equal in their rights,</HI> that <HI>it is impo&s;&s;ible to make them otherwi&s;e</HI>; and this being their un|di&s;turbed belief, they have no conception how any man in his &s;en&s;es can entertain any other. This point once &s;ettled, every thing is &s;ettled. Many operations, which in Europe have been con&s;idered as incredible tales or dangerous experiments, are but the infallible con&s;equences of this great prin|ciple. The fir&s;t of the&s;e operations is <HI>the bu&s;ine&s;s of election,</HI> which, with that people, is carried on with as much gravity as their daily labour. There is no jealou&s;y on the occa&s;ion, nothing lucrative in office; any man in &s;ociety may attain to any place in the government, and may exerci&s;e its functions. They believe that there is nothing more difficult in the management of the affairs of a nation, than the affairs of a family; that it only requires more hands. They believe that it is the juggle of keep|ing up impo&s;itions to blind the eyes of the vul|gar, that con&s;titutes the intricacy of &s;tate. Bani&s;h the my&s;tici&s;m of inequality, and you bani&s;h almo&s;t all the evils attendant on human nature.</P>
<P>The people, being habituated to the election of all kinds of officers, the <HI>magnitude</HI> of the office makes no difficulty in the ca&s;e. The pre&s;ident of
<PB N="24" REF="030026_0023_0FE400F2EA45F5E0">
the United States, who has more power while in office than &s;ome of the kings of Europe, is cho&s;en with as little commotion as a churchwarden. There is a public &s;ervice to be performed, and the people &s;ay who &s;hall do it. The &s;ervant feels honoured with the confidence repo&s;ed in him, and generally expre&s;&s;es his gratitude by a faithful performance.</P>
<P>Another of the&s;e operations is making every citizen a &s;oldier, and every &s;oldier a citizen; not only <HI>permitting</HI> every man to arm, but <HI>obliging</HI> him to arm. This fact, told in Europe, previous to the French revolution, would have gained lit|tle credit; or at lea&s;t it would have been regarded as a mark of an uncivilized people, extremely dangerous to a well ordered &s;ociety. Men who build &s;y&s;tems on an inver&s;ion of nature, are obliged to invert every thing that is to make part of that &s;y&s;tem. It is <HI>becau&s;e the people are civili|zed, that they are with &s;afety armed.</HI> It is an ef|fect of their con&s;cious dignity, as citizens enjoy|ing equal rights, that they wi&s;h not to invade the rights of others. The danger (where there is any) from armed citizens, is only to the <HI>govern|ment,</HI> not to the <HI>&s;ociety</HI>; and as long as they have nothing to revenge in the government (which they cannot have while it is in their own hands) there are many advantages in their being accu&s;tomed to the u&s;e of arms, and no po&s;&s;ible di&s;advantage.</P>
<P><HI>Power,</HI> habitually in the hands of a whole community, lo&s;es all the ordinary a&s;&s;ociated ideas of power. The exerci&s;e of power is a relative term; it &s;uppo&s;es an oppo&s;ition,&mdash;&s;omething to operate upon. We perceive no exertion of power in the motion of the planetary &s;y&s;tem, but a very &s;trong one in the movement of a whirlwind, it is
<PB N="25" REF="030026_0024_0FE400F7344A2B60">
becau&s;e we &s;ee ob&s;tructions to the latter, but none to the former. Where the government is <HI>not</HI> in the hands of the people, there you find oppo&s;ition, you perceive two contending intere&s;ts, and get an idea of the exerci&s;e of power; and whether this power be in the hands of the government or of the people, or whether it change from &s;ide to &s;ide, it is always to be dreaded. But the word <HI>people,</HI> in America, has a different meaning from what it has in Europe. It there means the whole community, and comprehends every human crea|ture; here it means &s;omething el&s;e, more diffi|cult to define.</P>
<P>Another con&s;equence of the habitual idea of equality, is the <HI>facility of changing the &s;tructure of their government,</HI> whenever, and as often as the &s;o|ciety &s;hall think there is any thing in it to amend. As Mr. Burke has written no
<Q>reflections on the revolution</Q>
in America, the people there have never yet been told that they have no <HI>right</HI>
<Q>to frame a government for them&s;elves;</Q>
they have therefore done much in this bu&s;ine&s;s, with|out ever affixing to it the idea of "&s;acrilege" or "u&s;urpation," or any other term of rant, to be found in that gentleman's vocabulary.</P>
<P>Within a few years the fifteen &s;tates have not only framed each its own &s;tate con&s;titution, and two &s;ucce&s;&s;ive federal con&s;titutions; but &s;ince the &s;ettlement of the pre&s;ent general government in the year 1789, three of the &s;tates, Penn&s;ylvania, South-Carolina, and Georgia, have totally new modelled their own. And all this is done without the lea&s;t confu&s;ion; the operation being &s;carcely known beyond the limits of the &s;tate where it is performed. Thus they are in the habit of
<Q>choo&s;|ing
<PB N="26" REF="030026_0025_0FE400FCD2B3EB08">
their own governors,</Q>
of
<Q>ca&s;hiering them for mi&s;conduct,</Q>
of
<Q>framing a government for them&s;elves,</Q>
and all tho&s;e abominable things, the mere naming of which, in Mr. Burke's opi|nion, has polluted the pulpit in the Old Jewry.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Dr. Price's Sermon preached in the Old Jewry before the Revolutionary Society, and Mr. Burke's abu&s;ive &s;trictures on the above expre&s;&s;ions u&s;ed by the Doctor.</NOTE></P>
<P>But it is &s;aid, The&s;e things will do very well for America, where the people are le&s;s numerous, le&s;s indigent, and better in&s;tructed; but they will not apply to Europe. This objection de&s;erves a reply, not becau&s;e it is &s;olid, but becau&s;e it is fa&s;hionable. It may be an&s;wered, that &s;ome parts of Spain, much of Poland, and almo&s;t the whole of Ru&s;&s;ia, are le&s;s peopled than the &s;ettled coun|try in the United States; that poverty and igno|rance are <HI>effects</HI> of &s;lavery rather than its <HI>cau&s;es</HI>; but the be&s;t an&s;wer to be given, is the example of France. To the event of that revolution I will tru&s;t the argument. Let the people have time to become thoroughly and &s;oberly grounded in the doctrine of <HI>equality,</HI> and there is no danger of op|pre&s;&s;ion either from government or from anarchy. Very little in&s;truction is nece&s;&s;ary to teach a man his rights; and there is no per&s;on of common in|tellects, in the mo&s;t ignorant corner of Europe, but receives le&s;&s;ons enough, if they were of the proper kind. For writing and reading are not in|di&s;pen&s;able to the object; it is <HI>thinking</HI> right which makes them act right. Every child is taught to repeat about fifty Latin prayers, which &s;et up the Pope, the Bi&s;hop, and the King, as the trinity of his adoration; he is taught that <HI>the powers that
<PB N="27" REF="030026_0026_0FE40101824CA368">
be, are ordained of God,</HI> and therefore the &s;oldier quartered in the pari&s;h has a right to cut his throat. Half this in&s;truction, upon oppo&s;ite prin|ciples, would go a great way; in that ca&s;e nature would be a&s;&s;i&s;ted, while here &s;he is counteracted. Engrave it on the heart of a man, <HI>that all men are equal in rights,</HI> and that the <HI>government is their own,</HI> and then per&s;uade him to &s;ell his crucifix and buy a mu&s;quet,&mdash;and you have made him a good citizen.</P>
<P>Another con&s;equence of a &s;ettled belief in the equality of rights is, that under this belief <HI>there is no danger from anarchy.</HI> This word has likewi&s;e acquired a different meaning in America from what we read of it in books. In Europe it means confu&s;ion, attended with mobs and carnage, where the innocent peri&s;h with the guilty. But it is very different where a country is <HI>u&s;ed</HI> to a repre|&s;entative government, though it &s;hould have an interval of no government at all. Where the peo|ple at large feel and know that they <HI>can do every thing</HI> by them&s;elves per&s;onally, they really <HI>do noth|ing</HI> by them&s;elves per&s;onally. In the heat of the American revolution, when the people in &s;ome &s;tates were for a long time without the lea&s;t &s;ha|dow of law or government, they always acted by committees and repre&s;entation. This they mu&s;t call anarchy, for they know no other.</P>
<P>The&s;e are materials for the formation of go|vernments, which need not be dreaded, though disjointed and laid a&s;under to make &s;ome repairs. They are deep-rooted habits of thinking, which almo&s;t change the moral nature of man; they are principles as much unknown to the ancient republics as to the modern monarchies of Eu|rope.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="030026_0027_0FE4010727DAED38">We mu&s;t not therefore rely upon &s;y&s;tems drawn from the experimental rea&s;onings of Ari&s;totle, when we find them contradicted by what we feel to be the eternal truth of nature, and &s;ee them brought to the te&s;t of our own experience. Ari&s;|totle was certainly a great politician; and Clau|dius Ptolemy was a great geographer; but the latter has &s;aid not a word of America, the large&s;t quarter of the globe; nor the former, of repre|&s;entative republics, the re&s;ource of afflicted hu|manity.</P>
<P>Since I have brought the&s;e two great luminaries of &s;cience &s;o near together, I will keep them in company a moment longer, to &s;how the &s;trange partiality that we may retain for one &s;uper&s;tition after having laid a&s;ide another, though they are built on &s;imilar foundations. Ptolemy wrote a &s;y&s;tem of A&s;tronomy; in which he taught among other things, that the earth was the centre of the univer&s;e, and that the heavenly bodies moved round it. This &s;y&s;tem is now taught (to the ex|clu&s;ion by an anathema of all others) in Turkey, Arabia, Per&s;ia, Pale&s;tine, Egypt, and where ever the doctrines of Mahomet are taught; while at the &s;ame time, and with the &s;ame reverence, the politics of Ari&s;totle are taught at the univer&s;ity of Oxford. The ground which &s;upports the one is, that the &s;un &s;topt its cour&s;e at the command of Jo&s;hua, which it could not have done, had it not been in motion; and the other, that <HI>the powers that be, are ordained of God.</HI> Mention to a Mu&s;|&s;elman the Copernican &s;y&s;tem, and you might as well &s;peak to Mr. Burke about the rights of man; they both call you an athei&s;t.&mdash;But I will proceed with the feudal &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>The next quality of a feudal tenure is what is
<PB N="29" REF="030026_0028_0FE4010AE044D188">
commonly called on the Continent the right of <HI>&s;ub&s;titution,</HI> in the Engli&s;h law, known by the name of <HI>entail.</HI> Of all the methods that have yet been di&s;covered to prevent men from enjoying the advantages that nature has laid before them, this is the mo&s;t extraordinary, and in many re&s;|pects the mo&s;t effectual. There have been &s;uper|&s;titions entertained by many nations relative to property in lands; rendering them more difficult of alienation than any other po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and con|&s;equently le&s;s productive. Such were the <HI>jus re|tractus</HI> of the Romans, the family-right of re|demption, and the ab&s;olute re&s;toration once in fifty years among the Jews, &s;imilar regulations among the ancient Egyptians, and laws to the &s;ame purpo&s;e under the government of the Incas in Peru.</P>
<P>The&s;e were all calculated to perpetuate family di&s;tinctions, and to temper the minds of men to an ari&s;tocratical &s;ubordination.

<P>Sir Edward Coke &s;hould have &s;pared his pane|gyric on the parliament of Edward the fir&s;t, as the fathers of the laws of entailments. He quotes with &s;ingular plea&s;ure the words of Sir William Herle, who informs us, that
<Q>King Edward I. was the wi&s;e&s;t King that ever was, and they were &s;age men, who made this &s;tatute.</Q>
Whatever wi&s;dom there is in the &s;tatute, is of an elder growth. It is a plant of genuine feudal extraction, brought into England by the Normans or Saxons, or &s;ome other conquerors; and though &s;ettled as common law, it began to be di&s;regarded and de&s;pi&s;ed by the judicial tribunals, as a &s;en&s;e of good policy prevailed. But the progre&s;s of li|berality was arre&s;ted by that parliament, and the law of entailments pa&s;&s;ed into the &s;tatute of We&s;t|min&s;ter the &s;econd.</P>
<P>This was con&s;idered as law in America, previ|ous to the revolution. But that epoch of light and liberty has freed one quarter of the world from this mi&s;erable appendage of Gothici&s;m; and France has now begun to break the &s;hackles from another quarter, where they were more &s;trongly rivetted. The &s;imple de&s;truction of the&s;e two laws, of <HI>entailment</HI> and <HI>primogeniture,</HI> if you add to it the <HI>freedom of the pre&s;s,</HI> will en&s;ure the continuance of liberty in any country where it is once e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>

&s;uch an allegiance to another man, is to have an evil &s;tar indeed; it is to be born to unchangeable &s;lavery.</P>
<P>A nobleman of Venice, at this moment, can|not &s;tep his foot over the limits of the republic without leave from the Senate, on pain of for|feiting his e&s;tate. Similar laws prevail in all feudal countries, where revolutions have not yet prevailed. They flee before the &s;earching eye of liberty, and will &s;oon flee from Europe.</P>
<P>Hitherto we have treated of claims, whether per&s;onal or territorial, that are confined to the elde&s;t &s;ons of families; but there is one genuine feudal claim, which "&s;preads undivided" to all the children, runs in all collateral directions, and extends to every drop of noble blood, wherever found, however mixt or adulterated,&mdash;it is the claim of <HI>idlene&s;s.</HI> In general it is &s;uppo&s;ed, that all indigent noble children are to be provided for by the government.

<P>In contemplating the peculiar de&s;tiny of this de&s;cription of men, we cannot but feel a mixture of emotions, in which compa&s;&s;ion gets the better of contempt. In addition to the misfortunes in|cident to other cla&s;&s;es of &s;ociety, their noble birth has entailed upon them a &s;ingular cur&s;e; it has interdicted them every kind of bu&s;ine&s;s or occu|pation, even for procuring the nece&s;&s;aries of life.

<P>Every capital in Europe, if you except Lon|don, throngs with this mi&s;erable cla&s;s of noble&s;&s;e, who are really and literally tormented between their pride and their poverty.

<P>But in France their hands are at la&s;t untied; the charm is broken, and the feudal &s;y&s;tem, with all its infamous idolatries, has fallen to the ground.

<P>BUT it would have been impo&s;&s;ible for the feudal &s;y&s;tem, with all its powers of inver&s;ion, to have held human nature &s;o long deba&s;ed, with|out the aid of an agent more powerful than an arm of fle&s;h, and without a&s;&s;ailing the mind with other weapons than tho&s;e which are furni&s;hed from its temporal concerns.

An open arrangement of forces, whether phy&s;i|cal or moral, mu&s;t be artfully avoided; for men, however ignorant, are as naturally di&s;po&s;ed to calculation, as they are to religion; they perceive as readily that an hundred &s;oldiers can de&s;troy the captain they have made, as that thunder and light|ning can de&s;troy a man.

<P>To render this truth a little more familiar to the mind of any reader who &s;hall find him&s;elf &s;ta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ed with it, we will take a view of the church in a different light from what we have yet con&s;i|dered it.

I.</NOTE>, was the Roman <HI>Magna Charta</HI>; and it &s;tood in place of a declaration of the rights of man. There is &s;omething extremely impo&s;ing in a maxim of this kind. Nothing is more pious, peaceful, and moderate in appearance; and noth|ing more &s;avage and abominable in its operation. But it is a genuine <HI>church-maxim,</HI> and, as &s;uch, de&s;erves a further con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>One obvious tendency of this maxim is, like the feudal rights, to inculcate radical ideas of ine|qualities among men; and it does this in a much greater degree. The feudal di&s;tance between man and man, is perceptible and definite; but the mo|ment you give one member of &s;ociety a familiar intercour&s;e with God, you launch him into the region of infinities and invi&s;ibilities; you unfit him, and his brethren, to live together, on any terms but tho&s;e of &s;tupid reverence and of in&s;olent abu&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="030026_0042_0FE4015627286A00">Another tendency is to make men cruel and &s;avage in a preternatural degree. When a per&s;on believes that he is doing the immediate work of God, he dive&s;ts him&s;elf of the feelings of a man. And an ambitious general, who wi&s;hes to extir|pate or to plunder a neighbouring nation, has on|ly to order the prie&s;t to do his duty, and &s;et the people at work by an oracle; they then know no other bounds to their frenzy than the will of their leader, pronounced by the prie&s;t; who&s;e voice to them is the voice of God. In this ca&s;e the lea&s;t attention to mercy or ju&s;tice would be abhorred as a di&s;obedience to the divine command. This cir|cum&s;tance alone, is &s;ufficient to account for two-thirds of the cruelty of all wars,&mdash;perhaps in a great mea&s;ure for their exi&s;tence,&mdash;and has given ri&s;e to an opinion, that nations are cruel in pro|portion as they are religious. But the ob&s;ervation ought to &s;tand thus, <HI>That nations are cruel in pro|portion as they are guided by prie&s;ts</HI>; than which there is no axiom more undeniably without ex|ception.</P>
<P>Another tendency of governing men by oracles, is to make them factious and turbulent in the u&s;e of liberty, when they feel them&s;elves in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it. In all ancient democracies, the great body of the people enjoyed no liberty at all; and tho&s;e who were called freemen, exerci&s;ed it only by &s;tarts, for the purpo&s;e of <HI>revenging</HI> injuries,&mdash;not in a regular con&s;tituted mode of <HI>preventing</HI> them: the body politic u&s;ed liberty as a medicine, and not as daily bread. Hence it has happened, that the hi&s;tories of ancient democracies, and of modern in&s;urrections, are quoted upon us, to the in&s;ult of common &s;en&s;e, to prove that a whole people is not capable of governing it&s;elf.

It is the <HI>want</HI> of liber|ty, not the <HI>enjoyment</HI> of it, which has occa&s;ioned all the factions in &s;ociety from the beginning of time, and will do &s;o to the end; it is becau&s;e the people are <HI>not</HI> habitually free from civil and eccle|&s;ia&s;tical tyrants, that they are di&s;po&s;ed to exerci&s;e tyranny them&s;elves. Habitual freedom produces effects directly the rever&s;e in every particular. For a proof of this, look into America, or, if that be too much trouble, look into human nature, with the eyes of common &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>When the Chri&s;tian religion was perverted, and pre&s;&s;ed into the &s;ervice of government, under the name of the <HI>chri&s;tian church,</HI> it became nece&s;&s;ary that its prie&s;ts &s;hould &s;et up for &s;upernatural pow|ers, and inve&s;t them&s;elves in the &s;ame cloak of in|fallibility, of which they had &s;tripped their pre|dece&s;&s;ors, the druids and the augurs. This they effected by miracles; for which they gained &s;o great a reputation, that they were canonized after death, and have furni&s;hed modern Europe with a much greater catalogue of &s;aints, than could be found in any breviary of the ancients. The poly|thei&s;m of the catholic church, is more &s;plendid for the number of its divinities, than that of the

Eleu&s;inian; and they are not inferior in point of attributes. The Denis of France is at lea&s;t equal to the Jupiter of Greece or the Apis of Egypt. As to &s;upernatural powers, the ca&s;e is preci&s;ely the &s;ame in both; and the portions of infallibility are dealt out from the pope to the &s;ubordinate prie&s;ts, according to their rank, in &s;uch a manner as to complete the harmony of the &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>Cicero has written with as much judgment and erudition on the "corruptions" of the old Roman Church, as Dr. Prie&s;tly has on tho&s;e of the new. But the difficulty is not that the <HI>church</HI> is corrupt|ed by men; it is, that <HI>men</HI> are corrupted by the church; for the very exi&s;tence of a church, as I have before defined it, is founded on a lie; it &s;ets out with the bla&s;phemy of giving to one cla&s;s of men the attributes of God; and the practi&s;ing of the&s;e &s;orceries by that cla&s;s, and the believing of them by another, corrupt and vitiate the whole.</P>
<P>One of the mo&s;t admirable contrivances of the Chri&s;tian church, is the bu&s;ine&s;s of <HI>confe&s;&s;ions.</HI> It requires great reflection to give us an idea of the effects wrought on &s;ociety by this part of the machinary.

<P>Another contrivance of the &s;ame &s;ort, and lit|tle inferior in efficacy, is the law of <HI>celibacy,</HI> impo&s;ed on the prie&s;thood, both male and female, in almo&s;t all church-e&s;tabli&s;hments, that have hitherto exi&s;ted. The prie&s;t is in the fir&s;t place armed with the weapons of moral de&s;truction, by which he is made the profe&s;&s;ional enemy of his fellow men; and then, for fear he &s;hould neg|lect to u&s;e tho&s;e weapons,&mdash;for fear he &s;hould con|tract the feelings and friend&s;hips of rational be|ings, by mingling with &s;ociety and becoming one of its members,&mdash;for fear his impo&s;itions &s;hould be di&s;covered by the intimacy of family connexions,&mdash;he is interdicted the mo&s;t cordial endearments of life; he is &s;evered from the &s;ym|pathies of his fellow-creatures, and yet compelled to be with them; his affections are held in the <HI>mortmain</HI> of perpetual inactivity; and, like the

dead men of Mezentius, he is la&s;hed to &s;ociety for tyranny and contamination.</P>
<P>The whole of this management, in &s;electing, preparing, and organizing the members of the eccle&s;ia&s;tical body, is pur&s;ued with the &s;ame uni|form, cold-blooded ho&s;tility, again&s;t the &s;ocial harmonies of life. The &s;ubjects are taken from the younger &s;ons of noble families, who, from their birth, are con&s;idered as a nui&s;ance to the hou&s;e, and an outca&s;t from parental attachment. They are then cut off from all opportunities of forming fraternal affections, and educated in a cloi&s;ter; till they enter upon their public func|tions, as di&s;connected from the feelings of the community, as it is de&s;igned they &s;hall ever re|main from its intere&s;ts.</P>
<P>I will not mention the corruption of morals, which mu&s;t re&s;ult from the combined cau&s;es of the ardent pa&s;&s;ions of con&s;trained celibacy, and the &s;ecret interviews of the prie&s;t with the women of his charge, for the purpo&s;e of confe&s;&s;ion<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">: I will draw no arguments from the di&s;&s;en&s;ions &s;own in families; the jealou&s;ies and con&s;equent aberrations of both hu&s;band and wife, occa&s;ioned by an in|triguing &s;tranger being in the &s;ecrets of both; the di&s;couragements la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d upon matrimony by a gene|ral dread of the&s;e con&s;equences, in the minds of men of reflection,&mdash;effects which are remarkable in all catholic countries; but I will conclude this article by ob&s;erving the direct influence that eccle|&s;ia&s;tical celibacy alone, has had on the population of Europe.</P>
<P>This policy of the church mu&s;t have produced, at lea&s;t, as great an effect, in thining &s;ociety, as the whole of her wars and per&s;ecutions. In ca|tholic Europe, there mu&s;t be near a million of ec|cle&s;ia&s;tics.

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE church, in all modern Europe, may be con&s;idered as a kind of &s;tanding army; as the members of that community have been, in every nation, the &s;ure&s;t &s;upporters of arbitrary power, both for internal oppre&s;&s;ion and for external vio|lence. But this not being &s;ufficient of it&s;elf, an additional in&s;trument, to be known by the name of the <HI>military &s;y&s;tem,</HI> became nece&s;&s;ary; and it &s;eems to have been expedient to call up another element of human nature, out of which this new in&s;trument might be created and maintained. The church was in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;tronge&s;t ground that could be taken in the human mind, the <HI>principle of religion</HI>; a principle dealing with things invi&s;ible; and con&s;equently the mo&s;t capa|ble of being it&s;elf perverted, and then of pervert|ing the whole mind, and &s;ubjecting it to any un|rea&s;onable pur&s;uit.</P>
<P>Next to that of religion, and &s;imilar to it in mo&s;t of its characteri&s;tic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, is the principle of <HI>ho|nour.</HI> Honour, like religion, is an original, in|delible &s;entiment of the mind, an indi&s;pen&s;able ingredient in our nature. But its object is inca|pable of preci&s;e definition; and con&s;equently, though given us in aid of the more definable feel|ings of morality, it is capable of total perver&s;ion, of lo&s;ing &s;ight of its own original nature, and
<PB N="51" REF="030026_0050_0FE402077A09CDA8">
&s;till retaining its name; of pur&s;uing the de&s;truc|tion of moral &s;entiments, in&s;tead of being their ornament; of deba&s;ing, in&s;tead of &s;upporting, the dignity of man.</P>
<P>This camelion principle was, therefore, a proper element of impo&s;ition, and was de&s;tined to make an immen&s;e figure in the world, as the foundation and &s;upport of the military &s;y&s;tem of all unequal governments. We mu&s;t look pretty far into human nature, before we &s;hall di&s;cover the cau&s;e, why killing men in battle &s;hould be deemed, <HI>in it&s;elf,</HI> an honourable employment. A hangman is univer&s;ally de&s;pi&s;ed; he exerci&s;es an office, which not only the feelings, but the policy of all nations, have agreed to regard as infamous. What is it that &s;hould make the difference of the&s;e two occupations, in favour of the former? Surely it is not becau&s;e the victims in the former ca&s;e are <HI>innocent,</HI> and the latter <HI>guilty.</HI> To a&s;&s;ert this, would be a greater libel upon human &s;ocietiy, than I can bring my&s;elf to utter; it would make the tyranny of opinion the mo&s;t <HI>dete&s;table,</HI> as well as the mo&s;t &s;overeign of all po&s;&s;ible tyrannies. But what can it be? It is not, what is &s;ometimes alleged, that <HI>courage</HI> is the foundation of the bu|&s;ine&s;s; that fighting is honourable becau&s;e it is dangerous; there is often as much courage di&s;|played in highway-robbery, as in the warme&s;t conflict of armies; and yet it does no honour to the party; a Robin Hood is as di&s;honourable a character as a Jack Ketch. It is not becau&s;e there is any idea of <HI>ju&s;tice</HI> or <HI>hone&s;ty</HI> in the ca&s;e; for, to &s;ay the be&s;t that can be &s;aid of war, it is impo&s;&s;ible that more than one &s;ide can be ju&s;t or hone&s;t; and yet both &s;ides of every conte&s;t are

equally the road to fame; where a di&s;tingui&s;hed killer of men, is &s;ure to gain immortal honour.

<P>Indeed, I can &s;ee but one rea&s;on in nature, why the principal of honour &s;hould be &s;elected from all human incentives, and relied on for the &s;upport of the military &s;y&s;tem; it is becau&s;e it was <HI>convenient for the governing power</HI>; that power being in the hands of a &s;mall part of the commu|nity, who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s was to &s;upport it by impo&s;i|tion. No principle of a permanent nature, who&s;e object is unequivocal, and who&s;e &s;lighte&s;t deviations are perceptible, would have an&s;wered the purpo&s;e. Ju&s;tice, for in&s;tance, is a principle of common u&s;e, of which every man can di&s;|cern the application. Should the Prince &s;ay it was <HI>ju&s;t,</HI> to commence an unprovoked war with his weak neighbours, and plunder their country, the fal&s;hood would be too glaring; all men would judge for them&s;elves, and give him the lie; and no man would follow his &s;tandard, unle&s;s bribed by his avarice. But honour is of another nature; it is what we all can feel, but no one can define; it is therefore whatever the Prince may choo&s;e to name it: and &s;o powerful is its operation, that all the u&s;eful &s;entiments of life lo&s;e their effect: morality is not only bani&s;hed

<P>It is common for a King, who wi&s;hes to make a thing fa&s;hionable, to practi&s;e it him&s;elf; and in this he is &s;ure of general imitation and &s;ucce&s;s.

<P>Hence it is, that warriors have been termed heroes; and the eulogy of heroes has been the con&s;tant bu&s;ine&s;s of hi&s;torians and poets, from the days of Nimrod down to the pre&s;ent century. Homer, for his a&s;toni&s;hing variety, animation, and &s;ublimity, has not a warmer admirer than my&s;elf; he has been for three thou&s;and years, like a reigning &s;overeign, applauded as a matter of cour&s;e, whether from love or fear; for no man with &s;afety to his own character can refu&s;e to join the chorus of his prai&s;e.

<P>At the &s;ame time that the feudal &s;y&s;tem was furni&s;hing Europe with a numerous body of noble&s;&s;e, it became nece&s;&s;ary, for various purpo&s;es of de&s;poti&s;m, that they &s;hould be prevented from mingling with the common ma&s;s of &s;ociety, that they &s;hould be held together by what they call <HI>l'e&s;prit de corps,</HI> or the corporation &s;pirit, and be furni&s;hed with occupations, which &s;hould leave them nothing in common with their fellow men.
<PB N="55" REF="030026_0054_0FE4021189F1EDD0">
The&s;e occupations were offered by the church and the army; and as the former was permanent, it was thought expedient to give permanency to the latter. Thus the military &s;y&s;tem has created the noble&s;&s;e, and the noble&s;&s;e the military &s;y&s;tem. They are mutually nece&s;&s;ary to each other's exi&s;t|ence,&mdash;concurrent and reciprocal cau&s;es and ef|fects, generating and generated, perpetuating each other by interchangeable wants, and both indi&s;|pen&s;able to the governing power.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e per&s;ons, therefore&punc; who undertake to de|fend the noble&s;&s;e as a nece&s;&s;ary order in the great community of men, ought to be appri&s;ed of the extent of their undertaking. They mu&s;t, in the fir&s;t place, defend <HI>&s;tanding armies,</HI> and that too upon principles, not of national prudence, as re|lative to the circum&s;tances of neighbours, but of internal nece&s;&s;ity, as relative only to the organi|zation of &s;ociety. They mu&s;t, at the &s;ame time, extend their arguments to the increa&s;e of tho&s;e ar|mies; for they infallibly mu&s;t increa&s;e to a degree beyond our ordinary calculation, or they will not an&s;wer the purpo&s;e; both becau&s;e the number of the noble&s;&s;e, or "the men of the &s;word" (as they are properly &s;tyled by their friend Burke,) is con|&s;tantly augmenting, and becau&s;e the influence of the church is on the decline. As the light of philo&s;ophy illuminates the world, it &s;hines in up|on the &s;ecrets of government; and it is nece&s;&s;ary to make the blind as broad as the window, or the pa&s;&s;engers will &s;ee what is doing in the cabinet. The means of impo&s;ition mu&s;t be increa&s;ed in the army, in proportion as they are lo&s;t in the church.</P>
<P>Secondly, they mu&s;t vindicate <HI>war,</HI> not merely as an occurrence of fatality, and ju&s;tifiable on the
<PB N="56" REF="030026_0055_0FE4018C5C78E8F0">
defen&s;ive; but as a thing of choice, as being the mo&s;t nutritious aliment of that kind of govern|ment, which requires privileged orders, and an army&punc; for it is no great figure of &s;peech, to &s;ay that the nobility of Europe, are always fed upon human gore. They originated in war, they live by war, and without war it would be impo&s;&s;ible to keep them from &s;tarving. Or, to drop the figure entirely, if mankind were left to the peace|able pur&s;uit of indu&s;try, the titled orders would lo&s;e their di&s;tinctions, mingle with &s;ociety, and become rea&s;onable creatures.</P>
<P>Thirdly, they mu&s;t defend the <HI>honor</HI> of the occupation which is allotted to the noble&s;&s;e. For the age is becoming extremely &s;ceptical on this &s;ubject; there are heretics in the world (Mr. Burke calls them athie&s;ts) who affect to di&s;believe that men were made expre&s;sly for the purpo&s;e of cutting each other's throats; and who &s;ay that it is not the highe&s;t honour that a man can arrive at, to &s;ell him&s;elf to another man for life, at a cer|tain daily price, and to hold him&s;elf in readine&s;s, night and day, to kill individuals or nations, at home or abroad, without ever inquiring the cau&s;e. The&s;e men &s;ay, that it is no compliment to the judgment or humanity of a man, to lead &s;uch a life; and they do not &s;ee why a nobleman &s;hould not po&s;&s;e&s;s the&s;e qualities as well as other peo|ple.</P>
<P>Fourthly, they mu&s;t prove that all occupations, which tend to <HI>life,</HI> and not to <HI>death,</HI> are di&s;ho|nourable and infamous&punc; Agriculture, commerce, every method of augmenting the means of &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence, and rai&s;ing men from the &s;avage &s;tate, mu&s;t be held ignoble; or el&s;e men of honour will forget them&s;elves &s;o far, as to engage in them;
<PB N="57" REF="030026_0056_0FE4021806D2CF98">
and then, farewell to di&s;tinctions. The National A&s;&s;embly may then create orders as fa&s;t as it has ever uncreated them; it is impo&s;&s;ible for nobility to exi&s;t in France, or in any other country, un|le&s;s the above articles are firmly defended by arguments, and fixed in the minds of mankind.</P>
<P>It &s;eems difficult for a man of reflection to write one page on the &s;ubject of government, without meeting with &s;ome old e&s;tabli&s;hed max|ims, which are not only fal&s;e, but which are preci&s;ely the rever&s;e of truth. Of this &s;ort is the opinion,&mdash;that inevitable wars in modern times, have given occa&s;ion to the pre&s;ent military &s;y&s;tem, and that &s;tanding armies are the be&s;t means of preventing wars. This is what the people of Europe are commanded to believe. With all due deference, however, to their com|manders, I would propo&s;e a contrary belief, which I will venture to lay down as the true &s;tate of the fact: <HI>That the pre&s;ent military &s;y&s;tem has been the cau&s;e of the wars of modern times, and that &s;tand|ing armies are the be&s;t, if not the only means of</HI> PROMOTING <HI>wars.</HI> This po&s;ition has, at lea&s;t, one advantage over tho&s;e that are commonly e&s;ta|bli&s;hed by governments, that it is believed by him, who propo&s;es it to the a&s;&s;ent of others. Men, who cannot command the power of the &s;tate, ought to enforce their doctrines by the power of rea&s;on.</P>
<P>To apply this maxim to the ca&s;e now before us; let us a&s;k, <HI>What is war?</HI> and on what pro|pen&s;ity in human nature does it re&s;t? For it is to MAN that we are to trace the&s;e que&s;tions, and not to <HI>Princes</HI>; we mu&s;t drive them up to <HI>principle,</HI> not &s;top &s;hort at <HI>precedent</HI>; and endeavour to u&s;e our &s;en&s;e, in&s;tead of parading our learning.

manner, antecedent to the formation of great &s;ocieties, there may be many cau&s;es of quarrels and a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inations; &s;uch as love, jealou&s;y, rapine, or the revenge of private injuries. But the&s;e do not amount to the idea of war. War &s;uppo&s;es a va&s;t a&s;&s;ociation of men engaged in one cau&s;e, ac|tuated by one &s;pirit, and carrying on a bloody con|te&s;t with another a&s;&s;ociation in a &s;imilar predica|ment. Few of the motives which actuate private men can apply at once to &s;uch a multitude, the greate&s;t part of which mu&s;t be per&s;onal &s;trangers to each other. Indeed, where the motives are clearly explained, and well under&s;tood by the com|munity at large, &s;o as to be really felt by the peo|ple, there is but one of the ordinary cau&s;es above mentioned, which can actuate &s;uch a body; it is <HI>rapine,</HI> or the hope of enriching them&s;elves by plunder. There can be then but two circum|&s;tances under which a nation will commence an offen&s;ive war: either the people at large mu&s;t be thoroughly convinced that they &s;hall be per&s;onally rewarded, not only with conque&s;t, but with a va&s;t &s;hare of wealth from the conquered nation, or el&s;e they mu&s;t be duped into the war by tho&s;e who hold the reins of government. All motives for national offences are reduced to the&s;e two, and there can be no more. The &s;ubject, like mo&s;t others, becomes extremely &s;imple, the moment it is con&s;idered.</P>
<P>And how many of the wars of mankind origi|nate in the fir&s;t of the&s;e motives? Among civili|zed nations, none. A people con&s;iderably numerous, approaching towards ideas of &s;ober policy, and beginning to ta&s;te the fruits of indu&s;|try, require but little experience to convince them&s;elves of the following truths.&mdash;that no be|nefit
<PB N="59" REF="030026_0058_0FE4021C96903EC0">
can be derived to the great body of individu|als from conque&s;t, though it were certain&mdash;that this event is always doubtful, and the deci&s;ion to be dreaded,&mdash;that nine tenths of the lo&s;&s;es in all wars are a <HI>clear</HI> lo&s;s to both parties, being &s;unk in expences,&mdash;that the remaining tenth nece&s;&s;arily comes in the hands of the principle managers, and produces a real misfortune even to the victo|rious party, by giving them ma&s;ters at home, in|&s;tead of riches from abroad.</P>
<P>The pitiful idea of fea&s;ting our&s;elves on a com|pari&s;on of &s;uffering, and balancing our own lo&s;&s;es by tho&s;e of the enemy, is a &s;tratagem of govern|ment, a calculation of cabinet arithmetic. Indi|viduals rea&s;on not in this manner. A di&s;tre&s;&s;ed mother in England, reduced from a full to a &s;canty diet, and bewailing the lo&s;s of her &s;on, receives no con&s;olation from being told of a wo|man in France, who&s;e &s;on fell in the &s;ame battle, and that the taxes are equally increa&s;ed in both countries by the &s;ame war. But Kings, and mini&s;ters, and Generals, and hi&s;torians proclaim, as a glorious conte&s;t, every war which appears to have been as fatal to the enemy as to their own party, though one half of each nation are &s;laugh|tered in the field, and the other half reduced to &s;lavery. This is one of the bare-faced impo&s;itions with which mankind are perpetually in&s;ulted, and which call upon us, in the name of humanity, to pur&s;ue this enquiry into the cau&s;es of war.</P>
<P>The hi&s;tory of ancient Rome, from beginning to end, under all its Kings, Con&s;uls, and Em|perors, furni&s;hes no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> a &s;ingle in&s;tance, after the conque&s;t of the Sabines, of what may properly be called a <HI>popular</HI> offen&s;ive war; I mean a war that would have been undertaken by the people, had

they enjoyed a free government, &s;o organized as to have enabled them to deliberate before they acted, and to &s;uffer nothing to be carried into exe|cution but the national will.</P>
<P>The &s;ame may be &s;aid of modern Europe, after a corre&s;ponding period in the progre&s;s of nations; which period &s;hould be placed at the very com|mencement of civilization. Perhaps after the &s;ettlement of the Saracens in Spain, the Lombards in Italy, the Franks in Gaul, and the Saxons in England, we &s;hould have heard no more of offen|&s;ive operations, had they depended on the unin|fluenced wi&s;hes of the people. For we are not to regard as <HI>offen&s;ive</HI> the &s;truggles of a nation for the recovery of liberty.</P>
<P>What an inconceivable ma&s;s of &s;laughter are we then to place to the other account; to dark, unequal government! to the magical powers, po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed by a few men, of blinding the eyes of the community, and leading the people to de&s;truction, by tho&s;e who are called their fathers and their friends! The&s;e operations could not be carried on, for a long time together, in ages tolerably en|lightened, without a permanent re&s;ource. As long as the military conditions of feudal tenures remained in full vigour, they were &s;ure to furni&s;h the means of de&s;truction to follow the will of the &s;overeign; but as the a&s;perities of this &s;y&s;tem &s;of|tened away by degree, it &s;eems that governments were threatened with the nece&s;&s;ity of applying to the people at large for voluntary enli&s;tments, and contributions in money; on which application the purpo&s;e mu&s;t be declared. This would be too di|rect an appeal to the con&s;ciences of men on a que&s;|tion of offen&s;ive war, and was, if po&s;&s;ible, to be avoided. For even the power of the church, pro|vided

there was no que&s;tion of here&s;y, could not be always relied on, to &s;timulate the people to a quarrel with their neighbours of the &s;ame faith; and &s;till le&s;s was it &s;ure of inducing them to part with their money. The expedient, therefore, of &s;tanding armies became nece&s;&s;ary; and perhaps rather on account of the money than the men.&mdash; Thus money is required to levy armies, and ar|mies to levy money; and foreign wars are intro|duced as the pretended occa&s;ion for both.</P>
<P>One general character will apply to much the greater part of the wars of modern times,&mdash;they are <HI>political,</HI> and not <HI>vindictive.</HI> This alone is &s;ufficient to account for their real origin. They are wars of agreement,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Whenever the real &s;ecret hi&s;tory of the En|gli&s;h and Spani&s;h armaments of 1790 &s;hall be pub|li&s;hed to the world, though it may not furni&s;h new arguments to men of reflection for di&s;tru&s;ting politi|cal cabinets, it may at lea&s;t increa&s;e the number of &s;uch men. But this cannot be done with &s;afety during the lives of &s;ome of the principal actors in that a&s;toni&s;hing piece of audacity. I am convinced, that the per&s;on, who at this moment &s;hould do it, would not &s;urvive the publication &s;o long as pope Ganganelli did the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of the Je&s;uits.</NOTE> rather than of di&s;&s;ention; and the conque&s;t is taxes, and not territory. To carry on this bu&s;ine&s;s, it is nece&s;&s;ary not only to keep up the military &s;pirit of the noble&s;&s;e by titles and pen&s;ions, and to keep in pay a va&s;t number of troops, who know no other God but their king; who lo&s;e all ideas of them&s;elves, in contemplating their officers; and who forget the duties of a man, to practi&s;e tho&s;e of a &s;oldier,&mdash;this is but half the

operation: an e&s;&s;ential part of the military &s;y&s;tem is to di&s;arm the people, to hold all the functions of war, as well the arm that executes, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the will that declares it, equally above their reach. This part of the &s;y&s;tem has a double effect, it pal&s;ies the hand and brutalizes the mind: an habitual di&s;u&s;e of phy&s;ical forces totally de&s;troys the moral; and men lo&s;e at once the power of protecting them|&s;elves, and of di&s;cerning the cau&s;e of their oppre&s;|&s;ion.</P>
<P>It is almo&s;t u&s;ele&s;s to mention the conclu&s;ions which every rational mind mu&s;t draw from the&s;e con&s;iderations. But though they are too obvious to be mi&s;taken, they are &s;till too important to be pa&s;&s;ed over in &s;ilence; for we &s;eem to be arrived at that epoch in human affairs, when "all u&s;eful ideas, and truths the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary to the happi|ne&s;s of mankind, are no longer exclu&s;ively de&s;tined to adorn the pages of a book<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>L'A&s;&s;embl&eacute;e Nationae.</HI></NOTE>." Nations, wear|ied out with impo&s;ture begin to provide for the &s;afety of man, in&s;tead of pur&s;uing his de&s;truction.</P>
<P>I will mention as one conclu&s;ion, which bids fair to be a practical one, that the way to prevent wars is not merely to change the military &s;y&s;tem; for that, like the church, is a nece&s;&s;ary part of governments as they now &s;tand, and of &s;ociety as now organized: but the <HI>principle of government</HI> mu&s;t be completely changed; and the con&s;equence of this will be &s;uch a total renovation of &s;ociety, as to bani&s;h &s;tanding armies, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">verturn the military &s;y&s;tem, and exclude the po&s;&s;ibility of war.</P>

<PB N="63" REF="030026_0062_0FE402282789B828">
requires no effort but that of natural deduction. The fir&s;t nece&s;&s;ary deduction will be, that the people will form an equal repre&s;entative govern|ment; in which it will be impo&s;&s;ible for <HI>orders</HI> or <HI>privileges</HI> to exi&s;t for a moment; and con&s;equently the fir&s;t materials for &s;tanding armies will be converted into peaceable members of the &s;tate. Another deduction follows, That the people will be univer&s;ally armed: they will a&s;&s;ume tho&s;e weapons for &s;ecurity, which the art of war has invented for de&s;truction. You will then have removed the <HI>nece&s;&s;ity</HI> of a &s;tanding army by the organization of the legi&s;lature, and the <HI>po&s;&s;ibility</HI> of it by the arrangement of the militia; for it is as impo&s;&s;ible for an armed &s;oldiery to exi&s;t in an armed nation, as for a nobility to exi&s;t under an equal government.</P>
<P>It is curious to remark how ill we rea&s;on on human nature, from being accu&s;tomed to view it under the di&s;gui&s;e which the unequal governments of the world have impo&s;ed upon it. During the American war, and e&s;pecially towards its clo&s;e, General Wa&s;hington might be &s;aid to po&s;&s;e&s;s the hearts of all the Americans. His recommenda|tion was law, and he was able to command the whole power of that people for any purpo&s;e of defence. The philo&s;ophers of Europe con&s;idered this as a dangerous cri&s;is to the cau&s;e of freedom. They <HI>knew</HI> from the example of Cae&s;ar, and Sylla, and Marius, and Alcibiad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s, and Pericles, and Cromwell, that Wa&s;hington would never lay down his arms, till he had given his country a ma&s;ter. But after he did lay them down, then came the miracle,&mdash;his virtue was cried up to be more than human; and it is by this miracle of
<PB N="64" REF="030026_0063_0FE401A0EF2E8590">
virtue in him, that the Americans are &s;uppo&s;ed to enjoy their liberty at this day.</P>
<P>I believe the virtue of that great man to be equal to any that has ever yet been known; but to an American eye no extraordinary portion of it could appear in that tran&s;action. It would have been impo&s;&s;ible for the General or the army to have continued in the field after the enemy left it; for the &s;oldiers were all <HI>citizens</HI>; and if it had been otherwi&s;e, their numbers were not the hundredth part of the citizens at large, who were all <HI>&s;oldiers.</HI> To &s;ay that he was wi&s;e in di&s;cern|ing the impo&s;&s;ibility of &s;ucce&s;s in an attempt to imitate the great heroes above mentioned, is to give him only the &s;ame merit for &s;agacity which is common to every other per&s;on who knows that country, or who has well con&s;idered the effects of equal liberty.</P>
<P>Though infinite prai&s;e is due to the con&s;tituent a&s;&s;embly of France for the temperate re&s;olution and manly firmne&s;s which mark their operations in general; yet it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed that &s;ome of their reforms bear the marks of too timorous a hand. Pre&s;erving an heriditary King with a tre|menduous accumulation of powers, and providing an unnece&s;&s;ary number of prie&s;ts to be paid from the national pur&s;e, and furni&s;hed with the means of rebuilding the half-de&s;troyed ruins of the hier|archy, are circum&s;tances to be pardoned for rea&s;ons which I have already hinted. But the enormous military force, which they have decreed &s;hall remain as a permanent e&s;tabli&s;hment, appears to me not only unnece&s;&s;ary, and even dangerous to liberty, but totally and directly &s;ubver&s;ive of the end they had in view. Their objects were the &s;ecurity of the frontiers and the tranquility of the
<PB N="65" REF="030026_0064_0FE4022DB9043100">
&s;tate; the rever&s;e of this will be the effect,&mdash;not perhaps that this army will be turned again&s;t the people, or involve the &s;tate in offen&s;ive wars. On the contrary, &s;uppo&s;e that it &s;imply and faith|fully defends the frontiers and protects the people; this defence and this protection are the evils of which I complain. They tend to weaken the nation, by deadning the &s;pirit of the people, and teaching them to look up to others for protection, in&s;tead of depending on their own invincible arm. A people that legi&s;late for them&s;elves ought to be in the habit of protecting them&s;elves; or they will lo&s;e the &s;pirit of both. A knowledge of their own <HI>&s;trength</HI> pre&s;erves a temperance in their own <HI>wi&s;dom,</HI> and the performance of their <HI>duties</HI> gives a value to their <HI>rights.</HI></P>
<P>This is likewi&s;e the way to increa&s;e the &s;olid dome&s;tic force of a nation, to a degree far beyond any ideas we form of a &s;tanding army; and at the &s;ame time to annihilate its capacity as well as inclination for foreign aggre&s;&s;ive ho&s;tilities. The true guarantee of perpetual tranquility at home and abroad, in &s;uch a ca&s;e, would ari&s;e from this truth, which would pa&s;s into an incontrovertible maxim, <HI>that offen&s;ive operations would be impo&s;&s;ible, and defen&s;ive ones infallible.</HI></P>
<P>This is undoubtedly the true and only &s;ecret of exterminating wars from the face of the earth; and it mu&s;t afford no &s;mall degree of con&s;olation to every friend of humanity, to find this un&s;peak|able ble&s;&s;ing re&s;ulting from that equal mode of government, which alone &s;ecures every other en|joyment for which mankind unite their intere&s;ts in &s;ociety. Politicians, and even &s;ometimes hone&s;t men, are accu&s;tomed to &s;peak of war as an
<PB N="66" REF="030026_0065_0FE401A6A269A588">
uncontroulable event, falling on the human race like a concu&s;&s;ion of the elements,&mdash;a &s;courge which admits no remedy; but for which we mu&s;t wait with trembling preparation, as for an epi|demical di&s;ea&s;e, who&s;e force we may hope to lighten, but can never avoid. They &s;ay that mankind are wicked and rapacious, and "it mu&s;t be that offences will come." This rea&s;on applies to individuals; but not to nations deliberately &s;peaking a national voice. I hope I &s;hall not be under&s;tood to mean, that the nature of man is totally changed by living in a free republic. I allow that it is &s;till <HI>intere&s;ted</HI> men and <HI>pa&s;&s;ionate</HI> men, that direct the affairs of the world. But in national a&s;&s;emblies, pa&s;&s;ion is lo&s;t in deliberation, and intere&s;t: balances intere&s;t; till the good of the whole community combines the general will. Here then is a great moral entity, acting &s;till from intere&s;ted motives; but who&s;e intere&s;t it never can be, in any po&s;&s;ible combination of circum&s;tan|ces, to commence an offen&s;ive war.</P>
<P>There is another con&s;ideration, from which we may argue the total extinction of wars, as a ne|ce&s;&s;ary con&s;equence of e&s;tabli&s;hing governments on the repre&s;entative wi&s;dom of the people. We are all &s;en&s;ible that &s;uper&s;tition is a blemi&s;h of human nature, by no means confined to &s;ubjects connected with religion. Political &s;uper&s;tition is almo&s;t as &s;trong as religious; and it is quite as univer&s;ally u&s;ed as an in&s;trument of tyranny. To enumerate the variety of ways in which this in&s;trument ope|rates on the mind, would be more difficult, than to form a general idea of the re&s;ult of its opera|tions. In monarchies, it induces men to &s;pill their blood for a particular family, or for a par|ticular branch of that family, who happens to
<PB N="67" REF="030026_0066_0FE40233070B8EF0">
have been born fir&s;t, or la&s;t, or to have been taught to repeat a certain creed, in preference to other creeds. But the effect which I am going chiefly to notice is that which re&s;pects the territo|rial boundaries of a government. For a man in Portugal or Spain to prefer belonging to one of tho&s;e nations rather than the other, is as much a &s;uper&s;tition, as to prefer the hou&s;e of Braganza to that of Bourbon, or Mary the &s;econd of England to her brother. All the&s;e &s;ubjects of preference &s;tand upon the &s;ame footing as the turban and the hat, the cro&s;s and the cre&s;cent, or the lily and the ro&s;e.</P>
<P>The boundaries of nations have been fixed for the accommodation of the <HI>government,</HI> without the lea&s;t regard to the convenience of the people. Kings and mini&s;ters, who make a profitable trade of governing, are intere&s;ted in extending the limits of their dominion as far as po&s;&s;ible. They have a property in the people, and in the territory that they cover. The country and its inhabitants are to them a farm &s;tocked with &s;heep. When they call up the&s;e &s;heep to be &s;heared, they teach them to know their names, to follow their ma&s;ter, and avoid a &s;tranger. By this unaccountable impo&s;ition it is, that men are led from one extravagant folly to another,&mdash;to adore their King, to boa&s;t of their nation, and to wi&s;h for conque&s;t,&mdash;circum&s;tances equally ridiculous in them&s;elves, and equally in|compatible with that rational e&s;timation of things, which ari&s;es from the &s;cience of liberty.</P>
<P>In America it is not &s;o. Among the &s;everal &s;tates, the governments are all equal in their force, and the people are all equal in their rights. Were it po&s;&s;ible for one State to conquer another State, without any expence of money, or of time,

or of blood,&mdash;neither of the States, nor a &s;ingle individual in either of them, would be richer or poorer for the event. The people would all be upon their own lands, and engaged in their own occupations, as before; and whether the terri|tory on which they live were called New York or Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts is a matter of total indifference, about which they have no &s;uper&s;tition. For the people belong not to the government, but the go|vernment belongs to the people.</P>
<P>Since the independance of tho&s;e States, many territorial di&s;putes have been &s;ettled, which had ri&s;en from the interference of their ancient char|ters. The interference of charters is a kind of policy which, I &s;uppo&s;e, every mother country ob&s;erves towards her colonies, in order to give them a &s;ubject of contention; that &s;he may have the opportunity of keeping all parties quiet by the parental ble&s;&s;ing of a &s;tanding army. But on the bani&s;hment of foreign control, and all ideas of European policy, the enjoyment of equal liberty has taught the Americans the &s;ecret of &s;ettling the&s;e di&s;putes, with as much calmne&s;s as they have formed their con&s;titution. It is found, that que&s;tions about the boundaries between free States are not matters of intere&s;t, but merely of form and convenience. And though the&s;e que&s;tions may involve a tract of country equal to an Euro|pean kingdom, it alters not the ca&s;e; they are &s;ettled as merchants &s;ettle the cour&s;e of exchange between two commercial cities. Several in&s;tan|ces have occured, &s;ince the revolution of deci|ding in a few days, by amicable arbitration, territorial di&s;putes, which determine the juri&s;dic|tion of larger and richer tracts of country, than
<PB N="69" REF="030026_0068_0FE40238F07457B8">
have formed the objects of all the wars of the two la&s;t centuries between France and Germany.</P>
<P>It is needle&s;s to &s;pend any time in applying this idea to the circum&s;tances of all countries, where the government &s;hould be freely and habitually in the hands of the people. It would apply to all E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ope; and will apply to it, as &s;oon as a revolution &s;hall take place in the principle of government.

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. THE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE.</HEAD>
<P>IT would be a curious &s;peculation, and perhaps as u&s;eful as curious, to con&s;ider how far the moral nature of man is affected by the organization of &s;ociety; and to what degree his predominant qualities depend on the nature of the government under which he lives. The adage, <HI>That men are every where the &s;ame,</HI> though not wholly fal&s;e, would doubtle&s;s be found to be true only in a limited &s;en&s;e.

It would teach us to &s;it down with a gloomy &s;atisfaction on the &s;tate of human affairs, to pronounce the race of man emphatically "fated to be cur&s;t," a community of &s;elf-tormentors and mutual a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins, bound down by the irre&s;i&s;tible de&s;tiny of their nature to be robbed of their rea&s;on by prie&s;ts, and plun|dered of their property by Kings.

<P>In confirmation of this adage, and as an apo|logy for the exi&s;ting de&s;poti&s;ms, it is &s;aid, That all men are by nature tyrants, and will exerci&s;e their tyrannies whenever they find opportunity. Allowing this a&s;&s;ertion to be true, it is &s;urely cited by the wrong party. It is an apology for equal, not for unequal governments; and the weapon belongs to tho&s;e who contend for the republican principle. If government be founded on the vices of mankind, its bu&s;ine&s;s is to re&s;train tho&s;e vices in all, rather than to fo&s;ter them in a few. The di&s;po&s;ition to tyrannize is effectually re&s;trained under the exerci&s;e of the equality of rights; while it is not only rewarded in the few, but invigorated in the many, under all other forms of the &s;ocial connexion. But it is almo&s;t impo&s;&s;i|ble to decide, among moral propen&s;ities, which of of them belong to nature, and which are the off|&s;pring

of habit; how many of our vices are charg|able on the permanent qualities of man, and how many re&s;ult from the mutable energies of &s;tate.</P>
<P>If it be in the power of a bad government to render men wor&s;e than nature has made them, why &s;hould we &s;ay it is not in the power of a good one to render them better? and if the latter be capable of producing this effect in any perceiva|ble degree, where &s;hall we limit the progre&s;s of human wi&s;dom, and the force of its in&s;titutions, in ameliorating, not only the &s;ocial condition, but the controlling principles of man?</P>
<P>Among the component parts of government, that, who&s;e operation is the mo&s;t direct on the moral habit of life, is the Admini&s;tration of Ju|&s;tice. In this every per&s;on has a peculiar i&s;olated intere&s;t, which is almo&s;t detached from the common &s;ympathies of &s;ociety. It it this which operates with a &s;ingular concentrated energy, collecting the whole force of the &s;tate from the community at large, and bringing it to act upon a &s;ingle individual, affecting his life, reputation, or property; &s;o that the govern|ing power may &s;ay with peculiar propriety to the mini&s;ter of ju&s;tice, <HI>divide et impera</HI>; for, in ca&s;e of oppre&s;&s;ion, the victim's cries will be too feeble to excite oppo&s;ition; his cau&s;e having nothing in common with that of the citizens at large. If, therefore, we would obtain an idea of the condi|tion of men on any given portion of the earth, we mu&s;t pay a particular attention to their judiciary &s;y&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">, not in its form and theory, but in its &s;pi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and practice.

impurities are found in the &s;ource from whence it de&s;cends, the only hope of clean&s;ing the &s;tream is by purifying the fountain.</P>
<P>If I were able to give an energetic &s;ketch of the office and dignity of a rational &s;y&s;tem of juri&s;|prudence, de&s;cribe the full extent of its effects on the happine&s;s of men, and then exhibit the per|ver&s;ions and corruptions attendant on this bu&s;i|ne&s;s in mo&s;t of the governments of Europe, it would furni&s;h one of the mo&s;t powerful arguments in favour of a general revolution, and afford no &s;mall con&s;olation to tho&s;e per&s;ons who look for|word with certainty to &s;uch an event. But my plan embraces too many &s;ubjects, to be particular on any; all that I can promi&s;e my&s;elf is to &s;eize the rough features of &s;y&s;tems, and mark the moral attitudes of man as placed in the nece&s;&s;ary po&s;ture to &s;upport them.</P>
<P>It is generally under&s;tood, that the object o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> government, in this part of its admini&s;tration, I merely to <HI>re&s;train</HI> the vices of men. But there is another object prior to this: an office more &s;acred, and equally indi&s;pen&s;able, is to <HI>prevent</HI> their vices, &mdash;to correct them in their origin, or eradicate them totally from the adole&s;cent mind. The lat|ter is performed by in&s;truction, the former by coercion; the one is the tender duty of a father, the other, the unrelenting drudgery of a ma&s;ter; but both are the bu&s;ine&s;s of government, and ought to be made concurrent branches of the &s;y&s;tem of juri&s;prudence.</P>
<P>The ab&s;urd and abominable doctrine, <HI>that pri|vate vices are public benefits,</HI> it is hoped will be blotted from the memory of man, expunged from the catalogue of human follies, with the &s;y&s;tem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of government which gave it birth. The ground
<PB N="73" REF="030026_0072_0FE40244308D61E0">
of this in&s;ulting doctrine is, that advantage may be taken of the extravagant foibles of individuals to increa&s;e the revenues of the State; as if the chief end of &s;ociety were, to &s;teal money for the government's pur&s;e! to be &s;quandered by the go|vernors, to render then more in&s;olent in their oppre&s;&s;ions! it is humiliating, to an&s;wer &s;uch arguments as the&s;e; where we mu&s;t lay open the mo&s;t degrading retreats of pro&s;tituted logic, to di&s;cover the po&s;itions on which they are founded. But <HI>Orders</HI> and <HI>Privileges</HI> will lead to any thing: once teach a man, that <HI>&s;ome are born to command and others to be commanded</HI>; and after that, there is no camel too big for him to &s;wallow.</P>
<P>This idea of the objects to be kept in view by the &s;y&s;tem of Ju&s;tice, involving in it the bu&s;ine&s;s of prevention as well as of re&s;triction, leads us to &s;ome ob&s;ervations on the particular &s;ubject of cri|minal juri&s;prudence. Every &s;ociety, con&s;idered in it&s;elf as a moral and phy&s;ical entity, has the un|doubted faculty of &s;elf-pre&s;ervation. It is an independent being; and, towards other beings in like circum&s;tances of independence, it has a right to u&s;e this faculty of defending it&s;elf, without previous notice to the party; or without the ob|&s;ervance of any duty, but that of ab&s;taining from offen&s;ive operations. But when it acts towards the members of its own family, towards tho&s;e dependent and defencele&s;s beings that make part of it&s;elf, the <HI>right</HI> of coercion is preceded by the <HI>duty</HI> of in&s;truction. It may be &s;afely pronounced, <HI>that a State has no right to puni&s;h a man, to whom it has given no previous in&s;truction</HI>; and con&s;equently, any per&s;on has a right to do any action, unle&s;s he has been informed that it has an evil tendency.

It is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ue, that, as relative to particular ca&s;es, the having given this information is a thing that the &s;ociety mu&s;t &s;ometimes <HI>pre&s;ume,</HI> and is not always obliged to <HI>prove.</HI> But the&s;e ca&s;es are rare, and ought never to form a general rule.

With what ju&s;tice or propriety it is &s;o adopted, a very little reflection will enable us to decide.</P>
<P>The great out-lines of morality are extremely &s;imple and ea&s;y to be under&s;tood; they may be &s;aid to be written on the heart of a man antece|dent to his a&s;&s;ociating with his fellow-creatures. As a &s;elf-dependent being he is &s;elf-in&s;tructed; and as long as he &s;hould remain a &s;imple child of <HI>nature,</HI> he would receive from nature all the le&s;|&s;ons nece&s;&s;ary to his condition. He would be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> complete moral agent; and &s;hould he violate the rights of another independent man like him&s;elf, he would &s;in again&s;t &s;ufficient light, to merit <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> puni&s;hment that the offended party might inflict upon him. But <HI>&s;ociety</HI> opens upon us a new field of contemplation; it furni&s;hes man with another cla&s;s of rights, and impo&s;es upon him an addi|tional &s;y&s;tem of duties; it enlarges the &s;phere of his moral agency, and makes him a kind of arti|ficial being, propelling and propelled by new dependencies, in which nature can no longer &s;erve him as a guide. Being removed from her rudimental &s;chool, and entered in the college of &s;ociety, he is called to encounter problems which the elementary tables of his heart will not always enable him to &s;olve. Society then ought to be con&s;i&s;tent with her&s;elf in her own in&s;titutions; if &s;he &s;ketches the lines of his duty with a variable pencil, too &s;light for his natural perception, &s;he

<P>We mu&s;t ob&s;erve farther,&mdash;that though &s;ociety it&s;elf be a &s;tate of nature, as relative to the nation at large,&mdash;though it be a &s;tate to which mankind naturally recur to &s;atisfy their wants and increa&s;e the &s;um of their happine&s;s,&mdash;though all its laws and regulations may be perfectly rea&s;onable, and calculated to promote the good of the whole,&mdash;yet, with regard to an individual member, his having <HI>con&s;ented</HI> to the&s;e laws, or even cho&s;e to live in the &s;ociety, is but a <HI>fiction</HI>? and a rigid di&s;cipline, founded on a fiction, is &s;urely hard upon its ob|ject. In general it may be &s;aid, that a man comes into &s;ociety by birth; he neither con&s;ents nor di&s;&s;ents re&s;pecting his relative condition; he fir&s;t opens his eyes on that &s;tate of human affairs in which the intere&s;ts of his moral a&s;&s;ociates are infinitely complicated; with the&s;e his duties are &s;o blended and intermingled, that nature can give him but little a&s;&s;i&s;tance in finding them out. His morality it&s;elf mu&s;t be arbitrary; it mu&s;t be varied at every moment, to comprehend &s;ome local and po&s;itive regulation; his &s;cience is to begin where that of preceding ages has ended; his alpha is their omega; and he is called upon to act by in|&s;tinct what they have but learnt to do from the experience of all mankind. Natural rea&s;on may teach me not to &s;trike my neighbour without a cau&s;e; but it will never forbid my &s;ending a &s;ack of wool from England, or printing the French con|&s;titution in Spain. The&s;e are po&s;itive prohibi|tions which nature has not written in her book; &s;he has therefore never taught them to her children.

<P>It is a truth, I believe, not to be called in que&s;t|ion, that every man is born with an impre&s;crip|tible claim to a portion of the elements; which portion is termed his <HI>birth-right.</HI> Society may vary this right, as to its form, but never can de&s;troy it in &s;ub&s;tance. She has no control over the man, till he is born; and the right being born with him, and being nece&s;&s;ary to his exi&s;tence, &s;he can no more annihilate the one than the other, though &s;he has the power of new&mdash;modelling both. But on coming into the world, he finds that the ground which nature had promi&s;ed him is taken up, and in the occupancy of others; &s;ociety has changed the form of his birth-right; the general &s;tock of elements, from which the lives of men are to be &s;upported, has undergone a new modifi|cation; and his portion among the re&s;t. He is told that he cannot claim it in its pre&s;ent form, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> an independent inheritance; that he mu&s;t draw on the &s;tock of &s;ociety, in&s;tead of the &s;tock of nature; that he is bani&s;hed from the moth|er and mu&s;t cleave to the nur&s;e. In this unex|pected occurrence he is unprepared to act but <HI>knowledge</HI> is a part of the &s;tock of &s;ociety; and an indi&s;pen&s;able part to be allotted in the portion of the claimant is <HI>in&s;truction</HI> relative to the new arrangement of natural right. To withhold th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> in&s;truction therefore would be, not merely the omi&s;&s;ion of a duty, but the commi&s;&s;ion of a crime; and &s;ociety in this ca&s;e would &s;in again&s;t the man&punc; before the man could &s;in again&s;t &s;ociety.</P>
<P>I &s;hould hope to meet the a&s;&s;ent of all unpreju|diced readers, in carrying this idea &s;till farther. In ca&s;es where a per&s;on is born of poor parents,

or finds him&s;elf brought into the community of men without the means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, &s;ociety is bound in duty to furni&s;h him the means. She ought not only to in&s;truct him in the artificial laws by which property is &s;ecured, but in the artificial indu&s;try by which it is obtained. She is bound, in <HI>ju&s;tice</HI> as well as policy, to give him &s;ome art or trade. For the rea&s;on of his incapacity is, that <HI>&s;he</HI> has u&s;urped his birth-right; and this is re&s;tor|ing it to him in another form, more convenient for both parties. The failure of &s;ociety in this branch of her duty is the occa&s;ion of much the greater part of the evils that call for criminal juri&s;prudence. The individual feels that he is robbed of his natural right; he cannot bring his proce&s;s to reclaim it from the great community, by which he is overpowered; he therefore feels authorized in repri&s;al; in taking another's goods to replace his own. And it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that in numberle&s;s in&s;tances the conduct of &s;ociety ju&s;tifies him in this proceeding; &s;he has &s;eized upon his property, and commenced the war again&s;t him.</P>
<P>Some, who perceive the&s;e truths, &s;ay that it is un&s;afe for &s;ociety to publi&s;h them; but I &s;ay it is un&s;afe not to publi&s;h them.

The former is the only kind from which moral evils ari&s;e; and to this the energies of government ought to be chiefly directed; e&s;pecially that part which is called the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>No nation is yet &s;o numerous, nor any country &s;o populous, as it is capable of becoming. Eu|rope, taken together, would &s;upport at lea&s;t five times its pre&s;ent number, even on its pre&s;ent &s;y&s;tem of cultivation; and how many times this increa&s;ed population may be multiplied by new di&s;coveries in the infinite &s;cience of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, no man will pretend to calculate. This of it&s;elf is &s;ufficient to prove, that &s;ociety at pre&s;ent has the means of rendering all its members happy in every re&s;pect, except the removal of bodily di&s;|ea&s;e. The common &s;tock of the community appears abundantly &s;ufficient for this purpo&s;e. By common &s;tock, I would not be under&s;tood to mean the goods exclu&s;ively appropriated to indi|viduals. Exclu&s;ive property is not only con&s;i&s;tent with good order among men, but it is conceived by &s;ome to be nece&s;&s;ary to the exi&s;tence of &s;ociety. But the common &s;tock of which I &s;peak con&s;i&s;ts, fir&s;t, in <HI>knowledge,</HI> or the improvement which men have made in the means of acquiring a &s;up|port; and &s;econdly, in the <HI>contributions</HI> which it is nece&s;&s;ary &s;hould be collected from individuals, and applied to the maintenance of tranquillity in the State. The property exclu&s;ively belonging to individuals can only be the &s;urplu&s;age remain|ing in their hands, after deducting what is nece&s;|&s;ary

to the real wants of &s;ociety. Society is the fir&s;t proprieter; as &s;he is the original cau&s;e of the appropriation of wealth, and its indi&s;pen&s;able guardian in the hands of the individual.</P>
<P>Society then is bound, in the fir&s;t place, to di&s;tribute knowledge to every per&s;on according to his wants, to enable him to be u&s;eful and hap|py; &s;o far as to di&s;po&s;e him to take an active intere&s;t in the welfare of the State. <HI>Secondly,</HI> where the faculties of the individual are naturally defective, &s;o that he remains unable to provide for him&s;elf, &s;he is bound &s;till to &s;upport and ren|der him happy.

It is no part of my &s;ubject to enter into this in|quiry, any farther than &s;imply to ob&s;erve, that it is the characteri&s;tic of arbitrary governments to be jealous of their power.

<P>For the purpo&s;es of compul&s;ive ju&s;tice it is not enough that the laws be rendered familiar to the people; but the tribunals ought to be near at hand, ea&s;y of acce&s;s, and equally open to the poor as to the rich; the means of coming at ju&s;tice &s;hould be cheap, expeditious, and certain; the mode of proce&s;s &s;hould be &s;imple and perfectly intelligible to the meane&s;t capacity, unclouded with my&s;teries and unperplexed with forms.

<P>As to the general &s;y&s;tem of the laws of the land, on which all property depends, no man in the kingdom knows them, and no man pretends to know them.

only expected as a matter of cour&s;e, and practi&s;ed without di&s;gui&s;e, but is made almo&s;t a nece&s;&s;ary part of the judiciary &s;y&s;tem?</P>
<P>Whether the practice of receiving bribes was the original idea on which is founded the <HI>venality of offices</HI> in modern governments, it is not to our purpo&s;e to inquire. But certain it is, they are concomitant ideas, and co-exten&s;ive practices; and it is de&s;igned that they &s;hould be &s;o. In France, before the revolution, the office of judge was not indeed hereditary, like that of king; but it was wor&s;e; it was held up for &s;ale by the king, and put at auction by the mini&s;ter. As a part of the king's revenue aro&s;e from the &s;ale of ju&s;tice, the government &s;old all the offices in that department at fixed prices; but the mini&s;ter made the bargains with tho&s;e who would give him in mo&s;t. Thus the &s;eats of the judges became objects of &s;pecu|lation, open to all the world; and the man, who&s;e con&s;cience was the be&s;t fitted to make a profitable trade of deciding cau&s;es, could afford to give the highe&s;t price, and was con&s;equently &s;ure to be judge.</P>
<P>Ju&s;tice then was a commodity which nece&s;&s;arily gave a profit to three &s;ets of men, before it could be purcha&s;ed by the &s;uitor; even &s;uppo&s;ing it might have flowed to him in a direct channel. But this was a thing impo&s;&s;ible; there were other de&s;criptions of men, more numerous, if not more greedy, than tho&s;e of whom we have &s;poken, through who&s;e hands it mu&s;t pa&s;s and repa&s;s, be|fore it could arrive at the client, who had paid his money to the judge. The&s;e men, who infe&s;ted the tribunals in all &s;tages of the bu&s;ine&s;s, were divided in France, into about &s;ix cla&s;&s;es. For want of the preci&s;e names in Engli&s;h to de&s;ignate all their official di&s;tinctions, we &s;hall rank the

whole under the great appellation of Lawyers<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>To avoid any &s;u&s;picion of exaggeration, I will mention by their original names &s;uch of the&s;e cla&s;&s;es as occur to me.

But though we here confound them together, as we often do objects at a di&s;tance; yet they were not to be &s;o treated by the client.

<P>Lawyers in France &s;erved two important pur|po&s;es, which it is &s;uppo&s;ed they do not &s;erve in England: they added con&s;iderably to the revenues of the crown by the purcha&s;e of their places; and they covered the iniquity of the judges under the impenetrable vail of their own. In a cau&s;e of ordinary con&s;equence, there was more writing to be done in France than there is even in England, perhaps by a hundred and fifty pages. The rea|&s;on of this was, that it was more nece&s;&s;ary to in|volve the que&s;tion in my&s;teries and perplexities that &s;hould be ab&s;olutely in&s;crutable. For it mu&s;t never be known, either at the time of trial or ever after, on what point or principle the cau&s;e was decided. To an&s;wer this end, the multiplying of the different orders of the managers, as well as encrea&s;ing the quantity of writing, had an admira|ble effect; it removed the po&s;&s;ibility of fixing a

charge of fraud or mi&s;management on any one of the great fraternity, or of di&s;covering, among the formidable piles of papers and parchments that enveloped the my&s;teries of the trial, in what &s;tage the iniquity was introduced.</P>
<P>To call this whole &s;y&s;tem of operations a &s;olemn farce, is to give no utterance to our feelings; to &s;ay it is a &s;plendid mockery of ju&s;tice by which individuals are robbed of their property, is almo&s;t to &s;peak its prai&s;e.&mdash;The reflecting mind cannot re&s;t upon it a moment, without glancing over &s;ociety, and bewailing the terrible inroads made upon morals public and private, the deva&s;tation of principle, the outrage upon nature, the degrada|tion of the la&s;t particle of dignity by which we re|cognize our own re&s;emblance in man.</P>
<P>Its obvious tendency is, by its enormous ex|pence, to bar the door of ju&s;tice again&s;t the poor, who in &s;uch countries are &s;ure to form the great body of mankind,&mdash;to render them enemies to &s;ociety, by teaching that &s;ociety is an enemy to them,&mdash;to &s;timulate them to crimes both from their own nece&s;&s;ities, and from the example of their ma&s;ters,&mdash;and to &s;pread over the people at large an incru&s;tation of ignorance, which exclu|ding all ideas of their duties and their rights, com|pels them to forget their relation to the human race.</P>
<P>Are the&s;e to be ranked among the circum&s;tances which call for a change in the governments of Eu|rope? Or are we to join with Mr. Burke, and lament as an evil of the French revolution, That the ancient &s;y&s;tem "of juri&s;prudence will no more be &s;tudied?"

<P>It is &s;o fa&s;hionable in Europe, e&s;pecially among Engli&s;hmen, to &s;peak in prai&s;e of the Engli&s;h juri&s;prudence, and to con&s;ider it as a model of perfection, that it may &s;eem nece&s;&s;ary for a per&s;on to begin with an apology for offering his ideas on that &s;ubject, if he means to deviate from the o|pinion &s;o generally e&s;tabli&s;hed.

<P>Exclu&s;ive of the rules by which the merits of a cau&s;e are to be decided (and which, if they could be a&s;certained, would be the <HI>law</HI>), the mere <HI>form</HI> of bringing a que&s;tion before a court is of it&s;elf a &s;cience, an art, le&s;s under&s;tood, and more difficult to learn, than the con&s;truction and u&s;e of the mo&s;t complicated machine, or even the motions of the heavenly bodies.

<P>Let us trace a few of the windings, and &s;ee where &s;ome of the paths lead which are laid down as nece&s;&s;ary to obtaining a deci&s;ion in Chancery; we &s;hall there find how hundreds, and &s;ometimes thou&s;ands of pounds are expended in a cau&s;e, before any defence is &s;et up, and where no defence is ever intended to be &s;et up. The &s;uitor begins his incomprehen&s;ible operation, by &s;tating his claim, in what is called a <HI>Bill,</HI> which he leaves at a cer|tain office belonging to the court, and obtains an order, called a &s;ubpoena, for &s;ummoning the defendant. This being done, the court requires the defendant to &s;end an Attorney to write his name at another office of the court. This writing the name, is called an <HI>appearance</HI>; it an&s;wers no po&s;&s;ible purpo&s;e, but that of increa&s;ing expences and fees of office, for which it is a powerful engine. For if the defendant does not comply, an expence of thou&s;ands of pounds may be made, to compel him. A <HI>cap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">as,</HI> a proce&s;s for <HI>outlawry,</HI> a commi&s;|&s;ion of <HI>rebellion,</HI> and an order and commi&s;&s;ion of <HI>&s;eque&s;tration,</HI> are pur&s;ued in their proper routine, till he con&s;ents to write his name.</P>

<P>We will, however, &s;uppo&s;e, that the defendant very good naturedly writes his name; he is then entitled to a certain delay, during which, the court informs him, he mu&s;t plead, demur, or an&s;wer to the bill. When this time expires, he is inti|tled to a farther delay of four weeks. But though he is <HI>entitled</HI> to this farther delay, and neither the plaintiff nor the court can refu&s;e it, &s;till he mu&s;t employ a &s;olicitor to make a brief for coun&s;el; and this &s;olicitor mu&s;t attend the coun&s;el, and give him and his clerk their fees, for moving the court for this delay, which cannot be refu&s;ed. The coun&s;el mu&s;t attend the court and make the motion; the &s;olicitor mu&s;t attend the court, and pay for the order, entry, and copy; and then mu&s;t cau&s;e it to be &s;erved.</P>
<P>At the end of this term of four weeks, the de|fendant is <HI>entitled</HI> to a farther delay of three weeks; which again cannot be refu&s;ed. But he mu&s;t pay his &s;olicitor for drawing and engro&s;&s;ing a petition for that purpo&s;e, and the petition mu&s;t be pre&s;ent|ed, and an&s;wered for which he mu&s;t pay; he mu&s;t al&s;o pay for order, entry, copy and &s;ervice. At the end of the&s;e three weeks, he is in the &s;ame manner <HI>entitled</HI> to a farther delay of two weeks; but the &s;ame farce mu&s;t be acted over again to ob|tain it. And a very &s;olemn farce it is to the par|ties, a very plea&s;ant farce to the officers of the court, and a very ridiculous farce to every body el&s;e</P>

<P>The&s;e terms mu&s;t be explained to the reader; and this is the be&s;t opportunity to do it. For the cau&s;e &s;till remaining preci&s;ely where it was at fir&s;t, we may &s;uppo&s;e it &s;ufficiently at re&s;t, not to move during the explanation. A <HI>capias</HI> is an order, to take the man, and hold him in gaol till he obeys the order of the court; whether it be to write his name, or any thing el&s;e. The word <HI>outlawry</HI> explains, of it&s;elf, this horrid engine of the court. A commi&s;&s;ion of <HI>rebellion</HI> is an order i&s;&s;ued, after the officer with the capias has &s;earched and cannot find the man, and after an outlawry has taken place. It is directed to other per&s;ons, requiring them to take up the man who was guilty of rebellion in refu&s;ing to write his name. But as the officer with the capias, before outlawry, could not find the man, the i&s;&s;uing the commi&s;&s;ion of rebellion <HI>now,</HI> has no other meaning but <HI>fees.</HI> A <HI>&s;eque&s;tration</HI> is taking the whole property of the defendant into the hands of the court. And when this is done, the cau&s;e is &s;oon done al&s;o; for no e&s;tate could la&s;t long there. When the money is gone the proceedings cea&s;e.</P>
<P>But let us &s;uppo&s;e that the defendant has com|plied with all orders thus far, and has put in a good and &s;ufficient an&s;wer. Let us leave out of our account all motions, petitions, decrees, or|ders, &amp;c. for amending the bill, for referring to Ma&s;ters the in&s;ufficiency of an&s;wers, reports upon tho&s;e an&s;wers, and farther an&s;wers, and excep|tions

<P>The bill expre&s;&s;es the claim of the plaintiff, and points out the nature of the decree, which he prays may be made in his favour again&s;t the de|fendant. Notice is given to the defendant that &s;uch a &s;uit is pending, and that he may appear and &s;how cau&s;e why the decree &s;hould not be made. Having given this notice, it is not only cruel, but ab&s;urd, to think of forcing him to defend him&s;elf whether he will or no. One would &s;uppo&s;e it little to the purpo&s;e, to make the attempt, Why may not the &s;ubpoena, which gives notice to the defendant, point out the day, beyond which he cannot give an an&s;wer? then, if he choo&s;es to de|fend, hear him candidly; but if he refu&s;es to come, and does not choo&s;e to defend,&mdash;proceed in the cau&s;e; he is willing that the decree &s;hould pa&s;s. Can it be rea&s;onable,&mdash;can it be any thing &s;hort of flat contradiction and non&s;en&s;e, to compel him to appear, to compel him to a&s;k for a delay, and to compel him to defend? Can his defence be nece&s;&s;ary in doing ju&s;tice to the plaintiff? and, if he will not defend him&s;elf, can you make him? Can any one of the whole ho&s;t of all the profe&s;&s;ions of the law &s;how the lea&s;t &s;hadow of u&s;e in all this flouri&s;h of proce&s;s thus far, but <HI>fees</HI> on the one hand, and <HI>oppre&s;&s;ion</HI> on the other?</P>
<P>To proceed through all the forms, to the end of a &s;uit in chancery, would be to write a com|mentary on many volumes of practice, and would be calling the patience of the reader to a trial, from which it would certainly &s;hrink. but there are parts as much wor&s;e than what we have de&s;cri|bed, as this is wor&s;e than common &s;en&s;e.

In New-York, Penn&s;ylvania, and almo&s;t every other State of the union, ju&s;tice is nearly as expen&s;ive as in Great Britain. The common law of the mother coun|try has been univer&s;ally adopted, and the &s;tatute books of the Briti&s;h Parliament blindly and &s;er|vilely copied. When this is the ca&s;e, and it can|not be controverted, have we rea&s;on to look for le&s;s expen&s;ive litigation in tho&s;e States than in the i&s;land of Great Britain? Can it be expect|ed that the channels of ju&s;tice will be le&s;s cor|rupt; and that the &s;ocial rights of individuals will be better protected and defended? In the courts of common pleas, particularly tho&s;e of New-York, the bill of the plaintiffs attorney a|lone is &s;eldom le&s;s than eight pounds. In the &s;upreme court of the &s;ame State, it often times &s;tretches beyond thirty pounds.

<P>Men who are habituated to the expen&s;es incur|red in law-&s;uits in England, will &s;carcely be per|&s;uaded of the extent to which a reform would be carried, on a general de&s;truction of abu&s;es.

&s;ubject requires, there is no my&s;tery left. The rational part that remains is &s;oon comprehended, and ea&s;ily retained in memory. This would doubtle&s;s augment the number of &s;uits; for it would open the courts to va&s;t multitudes of people, again&s;t whom they are now effectually &s;hut.

<P><PB N="100" REF="030026_0099_0FE40428D22D0F98">There is a &s;trange idea prevalent in England, (it has had its day in America) that it is good policy to rai&s;e the expences of legal proceedings above the reach of the lower cla&s;&s;es of people; as it le&s;&s;ens the number of &s;uits. This kind of rea&s;oning ap|pears too ab&s;urd to &s;upport its own weight for a moment; and it would be beneath our &s;erious no|tice, were it not for the reflection, that men of &s;uperficial re&s;earch are perpetually caught by it.

<P>For a man to bring into court a &s;uit that is manife&s;tly unju&s;t, is a crime again&s;t the &s;tate; to hinder him from bringing one that is ju&s;t, is a crime of the &s;tate again&s;t him.

<HEAD>CHAP. V. REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE.</HEAD>
<P>A Nation is &s;urely in a wretched condition, when the principal object of its government is the increa&s;e of its public revenue. Such a &s;tate of things is in reality a perpetual warfare between the few individuals who govern, and the great bo|dy of the people who labour. Or, to call things by their proper names, and u&s;e the only language

that the nature of the ca&s;e will ju&s;tify, the real oc|cupation of the governors is either to plunder or to &s;teal, as will be&s;t an&s;wer their purpo&s;e; while the bu&s;ine&s;s of the people is to &s;ecrete their pro|perty by fraud, or to give it peaceably up, in pro|portion as the other party demands it; and then, as a con&s;equence of being driven to this nece&s;&s;ity, they &s;lacken their indu&s;try, and become mi&s;erable through idlene&s;s; in order to avoid the mortifica|tion of labouring for tho&s;e they hate.</P>
<P>The art of con&s;tructing governments has u&s;ually been to organize the Sate in &s;uch a manner, as that this operation could be carried on to the be&s;t advantage for the admini&s;trators; and the art of admini&s;tring tho&s;e governments has been, &s;o to vary the means of &s;eizing upon private property, as to bring the greate&s;t po&s;&s;ible quantity into the public coffers, without exciting in&s;urrections. Tho&s;e governments which are called de&s;potic, deal more in open plunder; tho&s;e that call them|&s;elves free, and act under the cloak of what they teach the people to reverence as a con&s;titution, are driven to the arts of &s;tealing. The&s;e have &s;uc|ceeded better by theft than the others have by plunder; and this is the principal difference by which they can be di&s;tingui&s;hed. Under the&s;e <HI>con&s;titutional</HI> governments the people are more in|du&s;trous, and create property fa&s;ter; becau&s;e they are not &s;en&s;ible in what manner and in what quantities it is taken from them. The admini&s;|tration, in this ca&s;e, operates by a compound movement; one is to induce the people to work, and the other to take from them their earn|ings.</P>
<P>In this view of government, it is no wonder hat it &s;hould be con&s;idered as a curious and com|plicated
<PB N="107" REF="030026_0106_0FE4039FAEF0B940">
machine, too my&s;terious for vulgar con|templation, capable of being moved by none but experienced hands, and &s;ubject to fall in pieces by the &s;lighte&s;t attempt at innovation or improvement. It is no wonder that a church and an army &s;hould be deemed nece&s;&s;ary for its &s;upport; and that the double guilt of impiety and rebellion &s;hould follow the man who offers to enter its dark &s;anctuary with the profane light of rea&s;on. It is not &s;urpri+&s;ing that kings and prie&s;ts &s;hould be &s;uppo&s;ed to have derived their authority from God, &s;ince it is evidently not given them by men; that they &s;hould trace to a &s;upernatural &s;ource claims which nature never has recognized, and which are at war with every principle of &s;ociety.</P>
<P>I con&s;tantly bear in mind, that there is a re&s;|pectable cla&s;s of men in every country in Europe, who, whether immediately intere&s;ted in the admi|ni&s;tration of the governments or not, are con&s;ci|entiou&s;ly attached to the old e&s;tabli&s;hed forms.

But I &s;hould pay a real compliment to their &s;en&s;ibility, in &s;uppo&s;ing that their angui&s;h can be as great on viewing the picture, as mine has been in attempting to draw it; or, that they can &s;hudder as much at the pro&s;pect of a change, as I have done in contemplating &s;ociety under the di&s;tortions of its pre&s;ent organization. I &s;ee the noble nature of man &s;o cruelly deba&s;ed,&mdash;I &s;ee the hor&s;e and the dog in &s;o many in&s;tances rai&s;ed to a rank far &s;uperior to beings whom I mu&s;t ac|knowledge as my fellow-creatures, and whom my heart cannot but embrace with a fraternal af|fection which mu&s;t increa&s;e with the in&s;ults I &s;ee

<P>But I reflect that the contemplation of the&s;e mi&s;eries has already left an impre&s;&s;ion on my mind too deep to be ea&s;ily effaced.&mdash;I am likewi&s;e con|vinced that all the moral evils under which we la|bour, may be traced without difficulty, to their proper &s;ource,&mdash;that the &s;pirit of inve&s;tigation, which the French revolution has awakened in ma|ny parts of Europe, is &s;timulating the people to pur&s;ue the enquiry, and will con&s;equently lead them to apply the remedy. Under this pro&s;pect every per&s;on who but thinks he can throw the lea&s;t light upon the &s;ubject, is called upon for his a&s;&s;i&s;tance; and this duty to his fellow-creatures becomes more imperious, as it is increa&s;ed by the probability of &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>In con&s;idering the &s;ubject of <HI>Revenue and Expen|diture,</HI> as in other articles that I have treated, I &s;hall confine my&s;elf chiefly to the great outlines of the &s;y&s;tem; only noticing its effect on the moral habits which mu&s;t be con&s;idered as the vital prin|ciples of &s;ociety, and which ought always to be kept in view as the fir&s;t object of government, both in its original con&s;titution and in every part

of its admini&s;tration. I was indeed &s;en&s;ible that this &s;ubject would require more details; and that it might be u&s;eful to form an e&s;timate of the quan|tity of contributions nece&s;&s;ary for any given portion of mankind united in a national intere&s;t; as we might thus be convinced how &s;mall a revenue would be &s;ufficient for all the purpo&s;es of a rational government.

<P>Men are gregarious in their nature; they form together in &s;ociety, not merely from nece&s;&s;ity, to avoid the evils of &s;olitude, but from inclination and mutual attachment. They find a po&s;itive plea&s;ure in yielding a&s;&s;i&s;tance to each other, in communi|cating their thoughts and improving their faculties. This di&s;po&s;ition in man is the &s;ource of morals; they have their foundation in nature, and receive their nouri&s;hment from &s;ociety. The different portions of this &s;ociety, that call them&s;elves nations, have generally e&s;tabli&s;hed the principle of &s;ecuring to the individuals who compo&s;e a nation, the exclu&s;ive enjoyment of the fruits of their own labour; re&s;erving however to the governing power the right to reclaim from time to time &s;o much of the property and labour of individuals as &s;hall be deemed nece&s;&s;ary for the public &s;ervice. This is

the general ba&s;is on which <HI>property,</HI> public and private, has hitherto been founded. Nations have proceeded no farther. Perhaps in a more im|proved &s;tate of &s;ociety, the time will come, when a different &s;y&s;tem may be introduced; when it &s;hall be found more congenial to the &s;ocial nature of man to exclude the idea of &s;eperate property, and with that the numerous evils which &s;eem to be entailed upon it. But it is not my intention in this work to enter upon that enquiry.</P>
<P>When the feudal &s;y&s;tem, with all its ferocities, was in full operation, the &s;uperior lord, who re|pre&s;ented the power of the &s;tate, granted the lands to his immediate va&s;&s;als, on condition of military &s;ervice. They engaged to &s;erve in the wars of the lord paramount a certain number of days in the year, at their own expence. Thus they &s;tipulated as to the <HI>quantity</HI> of &s;ervice; but gave up the right of private judgment, as to the <HI>object of the war.</HI> This is the origin of the revenue &s;y&s;tem of mod|ern Europe; and it began by deba&s;ing the minds of the whole community; as it hurried them into actions, of which they were not to enquire into the ju&s;tice or propriety. Then came the <HI>&s;ocage|tenures</HI>; which were lands granted to another cla&s;s of va&s;&s;als, on condition of ploughing the lord's fields and performing his hu&s;bandry. This was a more rational kind of &s;ervice; though, by a &s;hocking pervertion of terms, it was called le&s;s honorable.</P>
<P>In proportion as war became le&s;s productive, and its profits more precarious, than tho&s;e of hu&s;|bandry, the tenures upon knight-&s;ervice were converted into &s;ocage-tenures; and finally it was found convenient in mo&s;t ca&s;es, e&s;pecially in Eng|land, to make a commutation of the whole into

The feudal rev|enues of the crown, though they were &s;uppo&s;ed to be &s;ufficient for the ordinary purpo&s;es of govern|ment, were capable of being increa&s;ed on any ex|traordinary occa&s;ion; and &s;uch extraordinary oc|ca&s;ions were &s;ure to happen, as often as the gov|ernment cho&s;e to draw more money from the peo|ple.

In many ca&s;es the authority of the pope was brought in to the a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance of the king, to enable him to levy money for the court. The pope, as head of the church, re|ceived a revenue from the people of England through the Engli&s;h clergy; and the king, on cer|tain occa&s;ions, agreed with him that he &s;hould double his demand; on condition that the addi|tional &s;um to be rai&s;ed, &s;hould be divided between them&s;elves.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Cunningham's Hi&s;tory of Taxes, page</HI> 6.</NOTE></P>

It is certain that the Cardinal de Richlieu has given them different advice.

<P>It mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, however, that in the bu|&s;ine&s;s of taxation, which is nearly all the bu&s;ine&s;s of a public nature that is done by the government in England; a policy not very different from that of Richlieu has been practi&s;ed with great &s;ucce&s;s.

To keep the &s;ubject ignorant of the&s;e things is the great &s;ecret in the modern &s;cience of finance. The money he pays to government being incorporated with every thing on which he lives, all that he can know of the matter is, that whether he eats, drinks or &s;leeps, walks or rides, &s;ees the light or breathes the air,&mdash;whatever he does, drains from him a tax; and this tax is to &s;upport the luxury of tho&s;e who tell him they are born to govern.

<P>It is difficult to de&s;cribe, perhaps impo&s;&s;ible to conceive, the quantity of evils wrought in &s;ociety from this mode of collecting revenue by decep|tion; or laying the duty in &s;uch a manner, that the people &s;hall not be &s;en&s;ible when or how it is paid. This is extremely unlike that manly prin|ciple of mutual confidence on which men unite in &s;ociety. It is the rever&s;e of that conduct, which, ari&s;ing from the open integrity of our own hearts, is the guarantee of integrity in others. It is a policy that mu&s;t have originated from two con|tending intere&s;ts in the nation, from a jealou&s;y of their own power in the legi&s;lative body, from a knowledge that &s;omething was wrong in them|&s;elves or in the &s;y&s;tem, and from a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s that one or the other, or both, were unworthy of the confidence of the people by whom they were &s;upported.</P>

to examine a po&s;ition, which, re&s;ting on the accumulated experience of mank<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nd, has not yet been &s;haken by enquiry.</P>
<P>I will begin by acknowledging the force of two ob&s;ervations, which go to the &s;upport of the pre&s;|ent &s;y&s;tem, as it applies to mo&s;t of the exi&s;ting governments and to the pre&s;ent &s;tate of &s;ociety in Europe: 1. As long as public revenues mu&s;t re|main as great as they now are, and as di&s;propor|tioned to the abilities of the people, it is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to di&s;gui&s;e the taxes on which they de|pend; otherwi&s;e they cannot be collected. 2. As long as the&s;e revenues are applied to the purpo&s;es to which they now are, it is impo&s;&s;ible to collect them but by fraud or violence; and violence has been found by repeated trials, e&s;pecially in Eng|land, not to an&s;wer the purpo&s;e &s;o well as fraud. While &s;ociety remains divided into two parties, which are con&s;titutionally oppo&s;ed to each other, it is impo&s;&s;ible but that they mu&s;t regard each other as enemies, and their conduct mu&s;t be the dictate of mutual aver&s;ion. When the people &s;ee that pay|ing money to their governors, is paying it to their enemies, they certainly never can give it with a good will; and when they know that this money &s;erves only to &s;trengthen the hands of their oppre&s;|&s;ors in forging new weapons of oppre&s;&s;ion again&s;t them&s;elves, they mu&s;t feel an obligation to with|hold it, rather than to pay it. In this ca&s;e, de|frauding the revenue is con&s;idered not only as ju&s;tice to them&s;elves, but as a duty to their chil|dren. A tax under the&s;e circum&s;tances is more naturally objectionable than the <HI>Dane-gelt,</HI> which was formerly paid in England: that contribution was made by the people, to hire a foreign enemy to leave them in peace; and it always had a tempo|rary
<PB N="120" REF="030026_0119_0FE4045E0DAC6978">
good effect. But a contribution paid to the people's enemies at home, who being few in number, mu&s;t &s;oon, if un&s;upported, fall of them|&s;elves, cannot promi&s;e even a temporary benefit; the hand of the enemy that receives it, does not &s;o much as lay down its weapon while it gra&s;ps the money. As long therefore as &s;ociety continues in its pre&s;ent di&s;ordered condition, any arguments drawn from moral propriety mu&s;t be overpowered by the &s;trong voice of nece&s;&s;ity; for rea&s;ons of nature generally fall in a conflict with rea&s;ons of &s;tate.</P>
<P>But as a new order of things begins to make its appearance, and principle is no longer to be bor|rowed from precedent, we will endeavour to di&s;|cover the ground of the received doctrine relative to taxation; and enquire how far that doctrine is, in it&s;elf, an object of reform. Out of the &s;even|teen millions &s;terling which are annually paid in|to the exchequer in England, but about two mil|lions and a half are levied in direct taxes; that is, in taxes laid in &s;uc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> a manner as to be paid direct|ly to the fi&s;cal officers by the per&s;ons on whom the burthen falls. The&s;e are chiefly comprehended in the taxes on lands and hou&s;es. In France, be|fore the revolution, the proportion of direct taxes was much greater. According to the &s;tatement of M. Necker, it was near eight millions &s;terling, out of about twenty-four millions and a half, of which the public revenue con&s;i&s;ted. This is &s;omething le&s;s than a third; while the proportion in Eng|land is little more than a &s;eventh. The&s;e propor|tions are &s;uppo&s;ed by &s;ome of the mo&s;t approved rea&s;oners on the &s;ubject, in each country, particu|larly M. Necker and Sir John Sinclair, to be as high as it would be prudent to go with direct tax|ation.
<PB N="121" REF="030026_0120_0FE403C4F656DBB0">
The remaining portion of the immen&s;e revenues in the&s;e two countries, about &s;ixteen mil|lions and a half for France, and fourteen and a half for England, was rai&s;ed in the former, and is &s;till rai&s;ed in the latter, by indirect taxation; by cu&s;toms, exci&s;e, and inland duties of various kinds, called <HI>taxes on con&s;umption.</HI> The art of impo&s;ing the&s;e, &s;o as to in&s;ure their collection, is to incor|porate the &s;um to be rai&s;ed for government with the price of every thing for which men pay their money in the cour&s;e of life. It is the hook with|in the bait of all our plea&s;ures, of all our conveni|ences and of all our nece&s;&s;aries. The hook can|not be &s;eparated from the bait, nor the bait from our exi&s;tence. With regard to individuals, the que&s;tion is not, &s;hall we pay the tax? but, &s;hall we exi&s;t? The continuance of life is a continuance of the tax; and the language of the &s;y&s;tem is, pay the debt to government, or pay the debt to na|ture.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid in ethics, on the &s;ubject of <HI>nece&s;&s;ity,</HI> that, &s;uppo&s;ing their is no choice of action, there can be no moral agency, and no virtue. We will not enquire into the propriety of the &s;uppo&s;ition as it re|&s;pects our relation to the Deity, and our &s;ubjection to the great laws of nature; but there can be no doubt that the rea&s;oning is ju&s;t, when applied to the laws of &s;ociety. Perhaps it is true, that, though I am prompted by the invi&s;ible de&s;tiny of nature, to do an action for the good of my fellow-creatures, this action is virtuous; but when the nece&s;&s;ity for this action ari&s;es directly from the po&s;itive laws of &s;ociety, in who&s;e favour it is to be performed&mdash;when the argument derives its force from the ax held over my neck, no idea of virtue can be annexed to the action; it is merely me|chanical.
<PB N="122" REF="030026_0121_0FE40462D76D0A30">
On this ground we may e&s;tabli&s;h a po&s;ition, which I believe will not be controvert|ed: that the exerci&s;e of <HI>private judgment</HI> is the foundation of <HI>moral virtue</HI>; and con&s;equently, that all operations of government carry de&s;truction to the latter, in proportion as they deprive us of the former. An arbitrary order impo&s;ed by a ma&s;ter, whether it be upon a nation or a &s;imple dome&s;tic &s;ervant, tends to deba&s;e the mind, and cru&s;h that native dignity which is ab&s;olutely nece&s;|&s;ary to the exi&s;tence of merit, or of &s;elf approba|tion. And the effect that &s;uch an order produces on the mind is nearly the &s;ame, whether the action enforced be right or wrong.</P>
<P>The true object of the &s;ocial compact is to im|prove our moral faculties, as well as to &s;upply our phy&s;ical wants; and where it fails in the fir&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the&s;e, it certainly will fail in the la&s;t. But when the moral purpo&s;e is attained, there can be no fear but that the phy&s;ical one will be the in&s;eparable con&s;equence; place &s;ociety on this footing, and there will be no aid or duty that the general inter|e&s;t can require from individuals, but what every individual will under&s;tand.

There is no po&s;ition more undenia|ble in my apprehen&s;ion, than that this would al|ways be the ca&s;e with a great majority of any peo|ple; and if we &s;uppo&s;e a &s;mall portion of refrac|tory per&s;ons, who, from want of original con|&s;ent; or from a &s;ub&s;equent change of opinion, &s;hould refu&s;e to perform their duties; in this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a&s;e, the opinions of the great majority a&s;&s;ume the &s;ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e

of government, and procure a compliance by com|pul&s;ion and re&s;traint. This is the only &s;ure foun|dation on which we can ever build the real dignity of &s;ociety, or the corre&s;ponding energy of govern|ment. It is e&s;tabli&s;hing the moral relations of men on the moral &s;en&s;e of men; and it is this union alone that can cheri&s;h our e&s;teem or command our re&s;pect.</P>
<P>On this plan, it is of the utmo&s;t importance that the wants of the &s;tate &s;hould never be di&s;|gui&s;ed, and that the duty of the individual, in &s;up|plying tho&s;e wants, &s;hould never be performed by deception. If the &s;tate be properly organized, &s;uch di&s;gui&s;e and deception will be unnece&s;&s;ary; and if we wi&s;h to pre&s;erve it from degeneration, they will be extremely dangerous; as, by attack|ing the moral &s;en&s;e of the people, they &s;ap the foundation of the &s;tate.</P>
<P>When a company of merchants, or other pri|vate men, engage in an enterpri&s;e that requires con|tributions in money, we hear of no difficulties in rai&s;ing the &s;tipulated &s;ums among the different partners in the company. Every partner makes it his bu&s;ine&s;s to under&s;tand the nature of the con|cern; he expects an advantage from the enter|pri&s;e, and pays his money with the &s;ame willing|ne&s;s, as he would pay it in his private bu&s;ine&s;s. He would feel him&s;elf in&s;ulted, if any di&s;gui&s;e were thrown upon the &s;ubject, to cheat him into his duty. Indeed, when the enterpri&s;e has come to an end, or when there is an apprehen&s;ion of lo&s;s, or a &s;u&s;picion of mi&s;management in the agents, it is natural to expect a reluctance in payment, which is only to be overcome by the arts of deception or the compul&s;ion of law. But this is not the ca&s;e while the company is in a pro&s;|perous

condition, and while its members are uni|ted by mutual confidence in pur&s;uit of a common intere&s;t. A nation, who&s;e government &s;hould be habitually in the hands of the whole community, would always be a company in this pro&s;perous con|dition; its concerns would be a perpetual and promi&s;ing enterpri&s;e, in which every individual would find his intere&s;t and repo&s;e his confidence. Per&s;onal protection and public happine&s;s would be the objects aimed at in the admini&s;tration; and the&s;e would be infallibly attained, becau&s;e no hu|man accidents could prevent it. There could be no &s;u&s;picion of mi&s;management in the agents, they being perpetually under the control of the whole people. Every rea&s;on, therefore, which could induce individuals to with-hold their pecuni|ary contributions, would be entirely removed; and the &s;ame motives which influence a man to give his attention and pay his money in his own per&s;onal concerns, would engage him to do the &s;ame things in the concerns of the public.</P>
<P>If the&s;e po&s;itions are not true, then have I mi&s;|conceived the character of the human heart, and the real effects to be wrought on &s;ociety by a ra|tional &s;y&s;tem of government; but if they are ac|knowledged to be true, it ought to be an indi&s;pen|&s;ible maxim to aboli&s;h and avoid every ve&s;tige of indirect taxation. It mu&s;t appear evident, that to rai&s;e money from the people by any other method, than by openly a&s;&s;igning to every one his portion, and then demanding that portion as a direct con|tribution, is unnece&s;&s;ary to the object of revenue, and de&s;tructive to the fir&s;t principles of &s;ociety. It has long been complained of in England (&s;o long that the complaint has almo&s;t cea&s;ed to make any impre&s;&s;ion even on the minds of tho&s;e who repeat

it) that <HI>the Exci&s;e is an odious tax</HI> The rea&s;on on which the complaint is founded is what the prin|ciple of government would naturally &s;ugge&s;t; but it is not the rea&s;on which I &s;hould a&s;&s;ign. The tax is &s;aid to be odious, chiefly becau&s;e it throws a vexatious power into the hands of the revenue officers, to &s;earch the hou&s;es and in&s;pect the affairs of individuals. As long as the government and the people are two oppo&s;ite parties in the &s;tate, at continual enmity with each other, it is natural that each party &s;hould wi&s;h to conceal its opera|tions, the better to &s;ucceed in their mutual ho&s;til|ity and defence; for &s;ecrecy is one of the weapons of war. But if the &s;tate con&s;i&s;ted of no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hing more than one great &s;ociety compo&s;ed of all the people, if the government was their will, and its object their happine&s;s, the rea&s;ons for &s;ecrecy would cea&s;e, the inte&s;tine war would cea&s;e, the par|ties would cea&s;e.</P>
<P>The bu&s;ine&s;s of the &s;tate and the bu&s;ine&s;s of in|dividuals might be &s;afely expo&s;ed to all the world. An open genero&s;ity of conduct, the reciprocal &s;ign and guarantee of integrity, would mark the character of every member of &s;ociety, whether acting as a public agent, or as a private citizen.</P>
<P>But the great objection which ought to be made again&s;t the exci&s;e, is the &s;ame as will apply to cu&s;toms, duties, and all other tricks of a &s;imilar kind, by which the money is drained from the people without their knowledge or con&s;ent. The whole &s;y&s;tem of indirect taxation, &s;o univer&s;al in Europe, &s;o much extolled by the able&s;t financiers, as nece&s;&s;ary in compo&s;ing their enormous ma&s;&s;es of extorted revenue, is wrong from its foundation, and mu&s;t be vicious in its practice.

The pride of birth and the jealou&s;y of rank operate on &s;ociety like congelation and concu&s;&s;ion on a body of water: they freeze up the whole ma&s;s, and break it into a thou&s;and pieces; which refu&s;e to unite among them&s;elves, or to an&s;wer the purpo&s;es which nature has a&s;&s;igned to that element.

The&s;e were perpetually repelling and repelled, torment|ed by jealou&s;ies, and kept a&s;under by artificial aver&s;ions, which &s;ilenced the voice of nature, and counteracted every object of &s;ociety.

all their arguments in form, I certainly mean to do it in &s;ub&s;tance; for I am not unappri&s;ed of their weight. Where the revenue is to be rai&s;ed only for <HI>hone&s;t</HI> purpo&s;es, and where it is to be kept within a moderate compa&s;s, &s;o that the taxes are to be no more than what a well-organi|zed community would be willing to lay upon it&s;elf, all arguments again&s;t rai&s;ing the whole by direct taxation are reducible to the&s;e two points: the <HI>improvident</HI> temper of one cla&s;s of men, and the unrea&s;onable <HI>&s;elfi&s;hne&s;s</HI> of others, have always ren|dered it difficult to obtain from them their contri|butions by direct and open means. The fir&s;t of the&s;e cla&s;&s;es comprehends many of the poor labour|ing people in the great towns. The&s;e people are in the habit of &s;pending all they can earn, if not for the nece&s;&s;aries of life, at lea&s;t for &s;uper&s;tuous or vicious gratifications. They never provide for a future want, even their own; much le&s;s would they think of providing for the wants of the &s;tate. As it is vain to a&s;k for money where it does not exi&s;t, no tax can be collected by applying directly to that cla&s;s of men. It is therefore thought be&s;t to mingle the tax with their meat and drink; and, &s;ince they will &s;pend all their money for the&s;e, let a part of it go to the &s;tate.</P>
<P>To this argument &s;everal an&s;wers may be offer|ed: <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> it is in a great mea&s;ure owing to the inherent defects of the government, that &s;uch a cla&s;s of improvident men is found in any &s;ociety. That men of good intellects and found con&s;titu|tions &s;hould be inattentive to the means of procur|ing happine&s;s, is certainly contrary to the analogy of nature. Indeed we overlook the cau&s;e when we go back to nature for it; there is no doubt but it is always to be found in their relative &s;ituation

in the &s;ocial &s;tate. It is the want of early in&s;truc|tion, or the want of proper objects of emulation to &s;timulate the mind to a &s;en&s;e of its own dignity, as relative to the &s;ociety in which it has to act. When the man is taught to know and feel that he never can ri&s;e above the condition of a bea&s;t of burthen, he acts at lea&s;t a con&s;i&s;tent part, perhaps even a wi&s;e part, in blunting his feelings, and beating down his mind to the level of his de&s;tina|tion. But it is not nece&s;&s;ary to &s;uppo&s;e that per|&s;ons in general, who are found in the cla&s;s above de&s;cribed, have to go through the &s;ame proce&s;s of rea&s;oning, and then of killing their rea&s;on, in or|der to arrive at this condition. Such indeed mu&s;t have been the origin of the bu&s;ine&s;s in the fir&s;t in&s;tance; but afterwards, the greater part are <HI>born</HI> in this element of apathy; they are &s;urround|ed all their lives by no other examples but beings of this &s;ort; and they never have a thought or a wi&s;h beyond their pre&s;ent &s;ituation. Their only object is to bani&s;h all thought and &s;tifle every wi&s;h; and whether they peri&s;h under the walls of an ale|hou&s;e, or in a king's &s;hip, or on the king's gal|lows, is to them a matter of perfect indifference.</P>
<P>Such is the deplorable condition of a numerous cla&s;s of beings whom monarchs and mini&s;ters mu&s;t recognize as their fellow-creatures; and if they are called more <HI>vitious</HI> than their rulers, it is be|cau&s;e we have perverted the meaning of the word. But I am not finding fault with <HI>men</HI> of any partic|ular de&s;cription whatever. In this drama of hu|man mi&s;ery, in which &s;o many di&s;torted charac|ters are acted, our moral faculties are warped and fitted to the part a&s;&s;igned us; and we perform it without &s;cruple or enquiry. The judge upon the bench is &s;carcely more to blame, than the &s;tupid

felon he condemns. The oppre&s;&s;ors and the op|pre&s;&s;ed, of every denomination, are in general, ju&s;t as wicked and ju&s;t as ab&s;urd as the &s;y&s;tem of gov|ernment requires. In mercy to them all, let the &s;y&s;tem be changed, let &s;ociety be re&s;tored, and human nature retrieved.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who compo&s;e the middle cla&s;&s;es of man|kind, the cla&s;&s;es in which the &s;emblance of nature mo&s;t re&s;ides, are called upon to perform this ta&s;k. It is true that, as rea&s;on is &s;low in returning to the mind from which it has been &s;o fatally bani&s;h|ed, it will require &s;ome time to bring the men, who now fill the two extremes in the wretched &s;cale of rank, to a proper view of their new &s;ta|tion of citizens. Minds that have long been cru&s;hed under the weight of privilege and pride, or of mi&s;ery and di&s;pair, are equally di&s;tant from all rational ideas of the dignity of man. But even the&s;e cla&s;&s;es may be brought back by degrees to be u&s;eful members of the &s;tate; and there would &s;oon be no individual, but would find him&s;elf happier from the change. Place government on the wi&s;|dom of the whole people, and they will always have wi&s;dom enough to conduct it.</P>
<P><HI>Second,</HI> under this natural organization of the &s;tate, &s;hould there remain a &s;mall number of im|provident men; unable to perform the duties of active citizens, there would be many rea&s;ons for excu&s;ing them from any part of the public bur|then. It is probable that very few in&s;tances would be found, where the inability did not ari&s;e from mental or bodily defects; in which ca&s;e, their claim on &s;ociety for &s;upport, would take place of any claim that &s;ociety could have upon them for the payment of a tax. In addition to the&s;e, we may &s;uppo&s;e a few others, who, from

accidental lo&s;&s;es, or other misfortunes to which &s;eparate property is liable, might be unable to an|&s;wer the demand of the collector; the&s;e the gov|ernment would naturally excu&s;e. If, after the&s;e, there &s;hould remain another cla&s;s, who, wantonly regardle&s;s of their own happine&s;s and of their &s;o|cial duties, &s;hould be found without the means of payment, (which is a &s;uppo&s;ition I admit only for the &s;ake of argument) the lo&s;s to the &s;tate would be very trifling in omitting to collect from them. It would bear no compari&s;on to the infinite mi&s;|chiefs that proceed from the &s;y&s;tem of di&s;gui&s;e.</P>
<P>As to the other point of objection, ari&s;ing from the unrea&s;onable <HI>&s;elfi&s;hne&s;s</HI> of &s;ome &s;orts of people, which makes it difficult to come at their money by any direct application to their per&s;ons, it de&s;erves a farther con&s;ideration. But to give it a full di&s;|cu&s;&s;ion would lead to a new range of &s;peculation into human nature, extending to a length which I fear would be di&s;proportionate to the limits a&s;|&s;ined to this chapter. I cannot be &s;atisfied with the common opinions we have entertained in re|gard to the effect that <HI>property</HI> would naturally have upon the human mind. I &s;ay <HI>naturally,</HI> not in contradiction to the <HI>&s;ocial</HI> &s;tate, but in contra|diction to the <HI>unnatural</HI> &s;tate, in which govern|ment, founded on conque&s;t or accident, has hither|to placed mankind. A natural &s;tate of &s;ociety, or a nation organized as human rea&s;on would dictate, for the purpo&s;e of &s;upplying the greate&s;t quantity of our phy&s;ical wants, with the corre&s;ponding improvement of our moral faculties, has never yet been thoroughly tried. It mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed therefore that the opinions we have formed of the human heart &s;tand a chance of being eroneous; as they have been formed under the di&s;gui&s;e of im|pre&s;&s;ions
<PB N="134" REF="030026_0133_0FE40483562AA308">
which do not belong to its nature. The picture of man could not have been fairly drawn while he &s;at with a veil upon his face. The&s;e facts being premi&s;ed, if we wi&s;h to come at his genuine character, the hi&s;tory of his actions mu&s;t be received with particular caution; as but little reliance can be had upon their te&s;timoney. The labyrinths of error in which he has been forced to wander, the delu&s;ive tapers with which he has been conducted, and the load of abu&s;es under which he has had to &s;truggle, mu&s;t have dimmed his under&s;tanding and deba&s;ed his moral powers, to a degree that cannot yet be accurately known. He ri&s;es into light, a&s;toni&s;hed at what he is, a&s;hamed at what he has been, and unable to con|jecture at what he may arrive.</P>
<P>Some general traits, however, may be di&s;cov|ered in his character, and recognized as the genu|ine &s;tamp of nature. Among the&s;e may be rec|koned a certain de&s;ire in every individual of obtain|ing the good opinion of his fellow-creatures.&mdash; Some degree of di&s;tinction, at lea&s;t &s;o far as to ac|quire an individuality of character among his equals, and merit their re&s;pect and confidence, is doubtle&s;s natural to man; and whatever, in a true &s;en&s;e, is natural, is, in the &s;ame &s;en&s;e, laud|able. A man, without the artificial aid that &s;oci|ety gives him, has but two re&s;ources on which he can rely for obtaining this re&s;pect; the&s;e are his <HI>phy&s;ical</HI> and his <HI>moral powers.</HI> By the cultivation of one or both of the&s;e, he renders him&s;elf u&s;eful, and merits the di&s;tinction that he wi&s;hes. Proper|ty, which is called, perhaps with &s;ufficient accura|cy, the creature of &s;ociety, is &s;ecured to individuals, only for their private benefit; or at mo&s;t as a pledge of their attachment to the community, by
<PB N="135" REF="030026_0134_0FE403E8DB85E9E8">
which it is guaranteed. It is not expected, on the true principles of &s;ociety, that an individual &s;hould di&s;po&s;e of any part of his own property to the benefit of the public. So much of it as the public requires in contributions, is demanded as a right; it belongs to the &s;tate by the nature of the &s;ocial contract, in return for the guarantee of the re&s;t. It cannot be intended therefore that this &s;hould be the way in which a man &s;hould u&s;e his property, to procure to him&s;elf re&s;pect; neither is it &s;o in fact. The reliance he has upon it, for the purpo&s;e of re&s;pect, is founded on a differ|ent principle. Except &s;uch proportion as is ne|ce&s;&s;ary in &s;upplying his per&s;onal wants, the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;or makes u&s;e of his property as a &s;ign, or as a &s;ub&s;titute, for per&s;onal merit. Indeed &s;o far as his property is the fruit of his own exertions, it is not an unnatural indication of abilities; and even where it has de&s;cended to him from his an|ce&s;tors, it is not a more unrea&s;onable ground of preten&s;ion, than hereditary titles of any other de|&s;cription.</P>
<P>On this principle, it is ea&s;y to trace the begin|nings of a deviation from a rational e&s;timate of things, in our attachment to property. A gov|ernment which had been founded in violence, and was to be carried on for the exclu&s;ive benefit of a &s;mall proportion of the community, mu&s;t have been under the nece&s;&s;ity, at all times, of &s;upport|ing it&s;elf by impo&s;ition. This circum&s;tance goes at once to the di&s;couragement and the di&s;u&s;e of the <HI>moral powers</HI> of individuals; as they mu&s;t cea&s;e to be cultivated, the moment they cea&s;e to be re&s;|pected. As the nation, at the &s;ame time, grew more numerous, and the &s;ucce&s;s of war and other great operations were found to depend le&s;s on <HI>bodi|ly
<PB N="136" REF="030026_0135_0FE40489086F1E60">
&s;trength,</HI> this too began to lo&s;e its e&s;timation, and could no longer be relied on, as a title to re&s;|pect. A natural re&s;ource therefore, by which to e&s;cape from the&s;e unnatural re&s;trictions, was found in a veneration for external and fallacious &s;igns of merit, appropriated to individuals. This was the origin of all hereditary titles of honour; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">d it mu&s;t likewi&s;e have been the origin, at lea&s;t in a great mea&s;ure, of our exce&s;&s;ive attachment to property.</P>
<P>There is another point of view in which this theory may be placed, that will &s;how it to be &s;till more probable. In the &s;ame proportion as this veneration for property offered a re&s;ource to in|dividuals, on their giving up the natural right of cultivating their per&s;onal talents, it al&s;o became a nece&s;&s;ary engine in the hands of the government. It is ea&s;y to perceive, that, in a &s;y&s;tem where ev|every thing depends on hereditary rank, the per|&s;on placed at the head ought always to be entitled to the greate&s;t &s;hare of re&s;pect. And where &s;hould a king &s;eek for this, but in exterior pomp? Nei|ther wi&s;dom nor &s;trength can be made hereditary, but titles and property may. It was ab&s;olutely requi&s;ite that tho&s;e qualities, in which the king might be rivalled or &s;urpa&s;&s;ed by his &s;ubjects, &s;hould be brought into di&s;repute; and that all mankind &s;hould fix their admiration on tho&s;e in which he could excel. Governments of this kind are &s;ure to be admini&s;tered in &s;uch a manner, that the king &s;hall always be the riche&s;t man in the na|tion; and they generally go farther, and make other men rich in proportion to their &s;ervility to him. It is thus that the order of nature is invert|ed, and names are &s;ub&s;tituted for things. The &s;imple u&s;es of <HI>property</HI> are converted into the &s;plen|did
<PB N="137" REF="030026_0136_0FE403EF173F4B40">
magnificence of <HI>wealth.</HI> This becomes the great and almo&s;t univer&s;al object of human ambi|tion; it excites the gaze and veneration of all cla&s;&s;es of men. Individuals are really not to be blamed, nor their judgment to be called in que&s;|tion, for this manner of e&s;timating things. Exte|rior pomp is, in fact, more u&s;eful to them, than per&s;onal qualifications. It indeed often takes place of all the &s;olid enjoyments of life; and it never can be &s;trange that it &s;hould do &s;o, as long as it procures that re&s;pect, the de&s;ire of which is doubtle&s;s among the &s;tronge&s;t pa&s;&s;ions of our na|ture. We never hear of a man committing &s;ui|cide for the want of bread, but it is often done for the want of a coach.</P>
<P>Such is the pa&s;&s;ion, and &s;uch, I believe, is the <HI>origin</HI> of the inordinate pa&s;&s;ion for property, in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of manners. The greater part of rational men agree that the&s;e things are wrong; they agree that the general ta&s;te and &s;entiments of mankind, on this &s;ubject, are eroneous; and they wi&s;h they could be changed. The only point in which I differ from the&s;e men in opinion is, that I have no doubt but the&s;e things <HI>will</HI> be chan|ged. I think we di&s;cern the radical cau&s;e of the evil; I think that cau&s;e will &s;oon be removed; and the remedy will inevitably follow; becau&s;e it is nothing more than a &s;imple operation of nature, recovering her&s;elf from re&s;traint. I am not preaching a moral lecture on the u&s;e of riches, or the duty of charity; I am endeavouring to point out the means by which the nece&s;&s;ity for &s;uch lec|tures may be &s;uperceded. A duty that runs con|trary to habit, is hard to be enforced, either by per&s;ua&s;ion or by law. Rectify our habits, and our duties will rarely be omitted.</P>
<P><PB N="138" REF="030026_0137_0FE4048CC4C19338">Good men in all civilized nations, have take<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> unwearied pains, and given them&s;elves real grief of heart, in cen&s;uring the vices and recommend|ing the duties of mankind, relative to the u&s;e and abu&s;e of property. Their labours have doubtle&s;s done &s;ome good; for we may readily conceive that the quantity of mi&s;ery in the world is not &s;o great as it might have been without them. But the&s;e men have not penetrated to the root of the evil; or rather, they have overlooked it; and the remedies they have propo&s;ed have always been partial, unpromi&s;ing, and without &s;ucce&s;s. They lay the blame to the natural propen&s;ities of the human heart, and call upon individuals for refor|mation. Whereas, the fault lies not &s;o deep, nor is the cure to be looked from individuals, even with re&s;pect to them&s;elves. Habit is the ape of na|ture; it a&s;&s;umes her appearance, and palms its vices upon her. And as the univer&s;al habit with re&s;pect to the &s;ubject now in que&s;tion has ari&s;en out of unnatural and degrading &s;y&s;tems of govern|ment, a reformation can be expected, only from referring back to nature for a change of tho&s;e &s;y&s;|tems; and there is no doubt but this remedy will be effectual.</P>
<P>E&s;tabli&s;h government univer&s;ally on the individ|ual wi&s;hes and collected wi&s;dom of the people, and it will give a &s;pring to the moral faculties of every human creature; becau&s;e every human creature mu&s;t find an intere&s;t in its welfare. It mu&s;t af|ford an ample &s;ubject for contemplation and exer|tion; which cannot fail to give a perpetual im|provement to the mind, and elevate the man to a more exalted view of him&s;elf, as an active mem|ber of that &s;ocial &s;tate, where virtue has a &s;cope for expan&s;ion, and merit is &s;ure to be rewarded.
<PB N="139" REF="030026_0138_0FE403F458690DD0">
Being thus re&s;tored to nature, every thing is ea&s;y and progre&s;&s;ive; the individual looks to him&s;elf for his title to re&s;pect, the moment he becomes habituated to believe and know that this is the only title that will an&s;wer his purpo&s;e. The idea of relying on the glare of exterior pomp, whether it be of wealth or hereditary rank, mu&s;t be regarded as what it really is in fact, the effort of a weak mind to cover its own weakne&s;s. Such efforts being re&s;ented by the people, as attempts to im|po&s;e upon their under&s;tanding, they mu&s;t fall in|to di&s;repute and be laid a&s;ide. They cannot be u&s;eful, they cannot be kept in countenance, in a &s;ociety founded on the ba&s;is of human rea&s;on.</P>
<P>It is difficult to conceive to what an extent this circum&s;tance would operate on the character of the human mind, with re&s;pect to its attachment to property. If the pre&s;ent &s;y&s;tems of government are unnatural, I am convinced that this part of the human character is unnatural; and a change in the former mu&s;t produce a change in the latter. One of the u&s;es of property, that of procuring re&s;pect would be entirely cut off. And it mu&s;t be con&s;i|dered that this is the u&s;e that has generally had the mo&s;t powerful effect upon the mind; becau&s;e it is immoderate and unbounded. It is well known that rivals in the di&s;play of wealth are among the mo&s;t jealous rivals in the world; and that there is u&s;ually no limit to the de&s;ires of a man on this &s;ub|ject, when they once pa&s;s the limit of his real or expected wants.</P>
<P>One &s;imple fact, with re&s;pect to the French na|tion, is almo&s;t &s;ufficient of it&s;elf to &s;upport the opinion I here advance. But I thought it nece&s;|&s;ary, before adducing that fact, to recur to theo|retical principles; in order to &s;hew that both the
<PB N="140" REF="030026_0139_0FE404934AC9EAC8">
fact and the opinion are founded in nature, and therefore may be tru&s;ted, &s;o far as they go, as the foundation of a practical &s;y&s;tem. It is well known that the national character of that people within four years has undergone almo&s;t a total change, with regard to the e&s;timation of exterior marks of di&s;tinction, of every kind. What is called rank, ari&s;ing from hereditary titles, had formerly as great an influence in the country, as at court; it was held as &s;acred in the mo&s;t &s;eque&s;tered walks of life, where actions obey the impul&s;es of the heart, as in the mo&s;t brilliant a&s;&s;embly, where they are regulated by a Ma&s;ter of Ceremonies. It is im|po&s;&s;ible for wealth it&s;elf in any nation to be more re&s;pected than titles were in France among all cla&s;&s;es and de&s;criptions of people. Their venera|tion for king was proverbial through the world; and this was only a &s;ample of their univer&s;al re&s;|pect for every thing that bore the name of heredi|tary tokens of rank. Their adoration of the&s;e di&s;tinctions could &s;carcely be con&s;idered as the effect of habit; it had &s;o far wound it&s;elf into the na|tive character and &s;oul of a Frenchman, that it could not be di&s;tingui&s;hed from an element of his nature. But the change of government, like a chymical analy&s;is, has &s;eparated the dro&s;s of habit from the gold of nature; it has melted off the courtier and &s;hewed us the man.</P>
<P>This is not all. <HI>The brilliance of wealth</HI> has likewi&s;e in that country lo&s;t its former value; it being no longer con&s;idered, either by the proprie|tors or by others, as capable of commanding re&s;|pect. I know it will be &s;aid, in an&s;wer to this, That it is owing to a temporary circum&s;tance; that the great body of the people, who have taken the government into their own hands, are envious

towards the rich, and are aiming to reduce all men to a level in regard to property. The plaine&s;t re|ply to this a&s;&s;ertion which has often been repeated is, <HI>that it is not true.</HI> No people ever &s;hewed a more &s;acred regard to private property than the French have uniformly done, during the whole revolution. And, as if to put calumny to the blu&s;h, and baffle all theories of &s;ophi&s;try again&s;t a popular reclamotion of rights, this regard to pri|vate property has been in proportion to the irregu|larity of their movements, and the opportunity for pillage. It is to be wi&s;hed that governments them&s;elves would learn a le&s;&s;on of honour from the&s;e examples of anarchy in&s;tead of employing venal writers to abu&s;e them.</P>
<P>It cannot be denied, that in all other parts of Europe there are two di&s;tinct purpo&s;es to which property is applied&mdash;a re&s;ource again&s;t phy&s;ical wants, and a re&s;ource for per&s;onal re&s;pect. It cannot be denied, that in France it has already cea&s;ed, in a great mea&s;ure, to an&s;wer the la&s;t of the&s;e purpo&s;es, The cau&s;e of this is perfectly na|tural, and I have no doubt that it mu&s;t be perma|nent. The &s;ame effect will be produced in other countries, by placing the government on the &s;olid ba&s;is of rea&s;on, in&s;tead of propping it up on the tottering foot-&s;tool of impo&s;ition.</P>
<P>I am aware that my argument is &s;till expo&s;ed to one objection, from tho&s;e readers who are ac|quainted with the pre&s;ent &s;tate of &s;ociety in <HI>Ameri|ca.</HI> It will be &s;aid, that the people of the United States manife&s;t a great attatchment to property, con&s;idered as <HI>wealth,</HI> and merely for the purpo&s;e of parade; that, though their government is American, their manners are European. To this I reply, in the fir&s;t place, that the charge is true
<PB N="142" REF="030026_0141_0FE40422EFA17B40">
only in a limited &s;en&s;e. The influence of riches in that country, even on the minds of tho&s;e who po&s;&s;e&s;s them, is by no means &s;o great as it is in Europe. But this an&s;wer will not be completely &s;atisfactory to the objector, neither is it &s;o to me. We mu&s;t acknowledge the fact to exi&s;t, at lea&s;t in a con&s;iderable degree, and endeavour to &s;earch out the cau&s;e. The people of that country have been always accu&s;tomed to borrow their maxims, as well as their manners, from the various nations of Europe, from which they emigrated; in the tra|ding towns, many of the pre&s;ent inhabitants are really Europeans, having been in the country but a &s;hort time; and emigration is perpetually &s;up|plying all parts of the States with new adventures; fa&s;hions, and a ta&s;te for expen&s;ive modes of living, are imported with other merchandi&s;e.

Under the&s;e circum&s;tances, the people continued mo&s;t of their ancient maxims, though they were a mixture of foreign and dome&s;tic; and, as habit is a coin current in all countries, it is not &s;urpri&s;ing that whatever had received the &s;tamp of authority in poli&s;hed nations of Europe, &s;hould be adopted without &s;cruple by the offspring of tho&s;e nations in America.</P>

chiefly be confined to the &s;ubject of Public Debts. This &s;ubject becomes more important at this time, not merely on account of the pre&s;ent magnitude of tho&s;e debts in mo&s;t of the &s;tates of Europe, but as relative to the principle on which they are contracted and &s;upported.

<P>Here we mu&s;t take a review of that mode of anticipation, which is common to mo&s;t of the modern governments of Europe, and known by the name of the <HI>funding &s;y&s;tem.</HI> This invention (for &s;o the art of funding is &s;ometimes called) has received from the hands of different writers, a con&s;iderable degree of cen&s;ure, as well as much unqualified and injudicious prai&s;e. Indeed, when con&s;idered with reference to its wide &s;weep of at|tending circum&s;tances, it pre&s;ents it&s;elf to the mind under a variety of a&s;pects, and forms alto|gether a &s;tupendous object of meditation; having produced effects that have far &s;urpa&s;&s;ed the limits of previous calculation or belief. In politics and war, it has changed the face of Europe. With regard to other concerns, both of nations and individuals, its effects have been various, contra|dictory, delu&s;ive, and incapable of accurate e&s;ti|mation. It has a&s;toni&s;hingly multiplied the force and activity of trade; but it has increa&s;ed in an equal degree the quantity of u&s;ele&s;s and de&s;truc|tive &s;peculation. It has converted commerce into a weapon of war; and it has made of that tre|mendous calamity an alluring in&s;trument of com|merce. It has brought the&s;e two occupations, &s;o

extremely oppo&s;ite in their nature, to a cordial coalition and mutual &s;upport; and thus by the aid of both, it facilitates every project of ambition in the government; till it familiari&s;es the public mind to a &s;erious acquie&s;cence in a paradox, which mu&s;t have excited the ridicule of any age accu&s;|tomed only to common calculation, That the more a nation is debilitated and exhau&s;ted, the more &s;plendid and powerful it grows. Indeed the &s;y&s;tem is replete with &s;o much apparent good, attended with its &s;olid weight of evils, that we may be thought to incur the guilt of partiality or inatten|tion, &s;hould we fail to qualify our cen&s;ure with &s;ome degree of approbation.</P>
<P>But the que&s;tion, Whether the &s;y&s;tem of fund|ing ought to be admitted in all its latitude, can be decided only by &s;triking the balance of good and evil in the effects that it mu&s;t from its nature pro|duce. And I think, on con&s;idering the &s;ubject as relative to a free republic, the balance will be found much more on the &s;ide of the evil, than it is when applied to the old plans of government.</P>
<P>The benefits, to be derived from the &s;y&s;tem, are of two kinds;&mdash;<HI>commercial,</HI> as it facilitates the bu&s;ine&s;s of individuals, and <HI>political,</HI> as it aids the government in the great operations of war. It is well known, or it is univer&s;ally believed, that the public debt in England, being funded on the ba&s;is of mortgaging the national revenue for its intere&s;t, has created a prodigious ma&s;s of capital in the hands of trade. By furni&s;hing men with a kind of &s;tock, which they are &s;ore of turning into money at any moment they choo&s;e, it enables them to vary their operations with &s;uch facility, as to &s;eize many ad|vantages in dome&s;tic and foreign markets, which mu&s;t otherwi&s;e pa&s;s without effect. It is in a great

mea&s;ure to this circum&s;tance, that many per&s;ons (perhaps without a due con&s;ideration of cau&s;es) have attributed the flouri&s;hing &s;tate of commerce in this kingdom. Indeed, &s;ince it is found that commerce has increa&s;ed with the augmentation of taxes, the argument in favour of unlimited fund|ing has become &s;o &s;educing, that the paradox has ari&s;en almo&s;t to a &s;oleci&s;m; it is &s;aid that public in&s;olvency is public wealth, and the national debt is it&s;elf a national benefit.</P>
<P>The advantages of a <HI>political</HI> nature, which are derived from the principle of funding, con&s;i&s;t in e&s;tabli&s;hing &s;uch an unque&s;tionable credit, that the government can at all times borrow, without the means or the intention, or even the promi&s;e of payment. This credit an&s;wers all the purpo&s;e of an inexhau&s;tible trea&s;ury, on which the govern|ment may draw at any moment, and to any amount. It is ea&s;y to conceive the immen&s;e faci|lity thus given to the mea&s;ures of admini&s;tration. It enables them to begin, on the &s;horte&s;t notice and with the greate&s;t &s;ecrecy, the mo&s;t expen&s;ive operations, and then to pur&s;ue them to any extent; and this without con&s;ulting the wi&s;hes of the na|tion. It precludes the nece&s;&s;ity of accumulating a national trea&s;ure by previous taxation and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">co|nomy; a mea&s;ure which mu&s;t always be attended with the di&s;advantage of lo&s;ing the u&s;e of the mo|ney, from the time it is hoarded, until it is ex|pended.

of mini&s;ters, and to the &s;ucce&s;s of extraor|dinary enterpri&s;es.</P>
<P>Such is the general &s;ummary of the advantages derived from the Funding Sy&s;tem; and this opens to our view the train of evils with which they are contra&s;ted. The&s;e I fear will be too numerous to be particularly noticed, and too great to be readily conceived. In the hands of an admini&s;tration, I will not &s;ay <HI>corrupt,</HI> but an admini&s;tration who&s;e intere&s;t is in any mea&s;ure different from that of the nation at large, this &s;y&s;tem is the mo&s;t danger|ous in&s;trument that can be imagined: as it is an in&s;trument of incalculable force, and may be al|ways wielded without oppo&s;ition. This from the nature of the &s;ubject mu&s;t be the ca&s;e; becau&s;e the expences of any projected enterpri&s;e being charged on po&s;terity, the party mo&s;t intere&s;ted in making the oppo&s;ition, is not in being at the time, and cannot be heard in its remon&s;trance. Thus, in the bu&s;ine&s;s of war, which is the principal object in the funding &s;y&s;tem, it enables governments to hire men to &s;laughter each other with more than their own &s;words. They wring out of the hard earnings of future generatio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the means of de|&s;troying the pre&s;ent.

And the&s;e expences they mu&s;t pay under the cruel di&s;advantages of being deprived of half their na|tural re&s;ources, by a diminution of their natural numbers.</P>
<P><PB N="149" REF="030026_0148_0FE4041177EFBB90">As military operations are now conducted, every man killed or de&s;troyed in war, co&s;ts to the nation upwards of a thou&s;and pounds &s;terling. This cal|culation is taken from a view of the la&s;t war in which England was engaged. The nation ex|pended in that war, as &s;tated by Sir John Sinclair,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Hi&s;t. of the Revenue, Part III. page</HI> 9<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE> &s;omething more than 139 millions.

<P>It requires but a &s;light ob&s;ervation on the cha|racter of the times in different ages, to &s;how that the object of war, and the &s;pirit with which it is conducted, have been altogether different, within the pre&s;ent century, from what they were in more remote periods of modern hi&s;tory. In the mari|time nation<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of Europe, the object of war has changed from religion to commerce; from a point of honour among kings, to a point of profit among merchants, mini&s;ters and generals.

Therefore, to find the means

of earning it on, they re&s;ort to a principle conge|nial to the object of the war; and it becomes &s;up|ported, as it is projected, in the &s;pirit of commerce. But, as all offen&s;ive wars, in every po&s;&s;ible cir|cum&s;tance, can only be maintained by deceiving the people, the government in this ca&s;e recurs to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> deception, and i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">uces them to un|dertake the burthen, on condition that the weight of it be &s;hifted off to a future period. Such is the origin of funding; and it has evidently ri&s;en out of the nece&s;&s;ity that governments were under, of changing the principle of deception, in order to conform to the &s;pirit of the times.</P>
<P>As an engine of &s;tate, the funding &s;y&s;tem has completely taken place of religious enthu&s;ia&s;m; and mankind have been hurried on to their own de&s;truction by the former, within the two la&s;t ages; with as little prudence and as much delu&s;ion, as they were by the latter, in the twelfth century. Indeed, I &s;ee no rea&s;on why a genuine cru&s;ade could not have been undertaken, even by the go|vernment of Great Britain within the la&s;t fifty years, and carried on to any extent, by the aid of the funding &s;y&s;tem. For the principle of the &s;y&s;|tem is &s;uch as to prevent men from enquiring into the object of the war; as every inducement to &s;uch enquiry is almo&s;t completely taken away, with re&s;pect to every cla&s;s of &s;ociety.

<P>From the time when the predatory &s;pirit, which led the northern Barbarians to ravage the &s;outh of Europe, had &s;ub&s;ided, and given place to its natu|ral offspring, in the e&s;tabli&s;hment of feudal mo|narchy, the hi&s;tory of this quarter of the world begins to a&s;&s;ume a con&s;i&s;tent &s;hape; and it offers it&s;elf to our contemplation, as relative to the &s;pirit of nations, under three &s;ucce&s;&s;ive a&s;pects. The&s;e are the &s;pirit of hierarchy, the &s;pirit of chivalry, and the &s;pirit of commerce. Out of the&s;e dif|ferent materials the genius of the government has forged in&s;truments of oppre&s;&s;ion almo&s;t equally de&s;tructive. It has never failed to cloud the minds of the nation with &s;ome kind of &s;uper&s;tition, con|formable to the temper of the times. In one age it is the &s;uper&s;tition of religion, in another the &s;uper&s;tition of honour, in another the &s;uper&s;tition of public credit.</P>
<P>The deplorable u&s;e that has been made of the la&s;t of the&s;e, during the pre&s;ent century in Eng|land, and for a much longer period in &s;ome other governments, has induced many per&s;ons to regret that the &s;pirit of commerce has ever become pre|dominant over that of chivalry and that of the church.

of the other two. But before we find fault with what &s;eems to be the order of nature in the&s;e events, we ought to con&s;ider the effects that it has and will produce, in the progre&s;s of &s;ociety and morals. Chivalry and hierac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> taught us to be|lieve that all men who did not pay homage to the &s;ame monarch, or u&s;e the &s;ame mode of wor&s;hip with our&s;elves, were our natural enemies, and ought to be extirpated. The &s;pirit of commerce has brought us acquainted with tho&s;e people; we find them to be like other men, and that they are really <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;eful to us in &s;upplying our wants. As their exi&s;tence and their pro&s;perity are found to be advantageous to us in a commercial point of view, we cea&s;e to regard them as enemies; and refu&s;e to go and kill them, unle&s;s we are hired to do it. But as commerce may deal in human &s;laugh|ter as well as in other things, when ever the go|vernment will offer us more money for de&s;troying our neighbours than we can get by other bu&s;ine&s;s, we are ready to make enemies of our be&s;t friends, and to go to war, as we go to market, on a calcu|lation of profit.</P>
<P>This is the true &s;pirit of commerce, as relative to war. But as this &s;pirit has made us better ac|quainted with all foreign nations, and with our|&s;elves, it has excited a di&s;po&s;ition for enquiry into the moral relations of men, with a view to politi|cal happine&s;s. The re&s;ult of this enquiry is now beginning <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n appear.

of its admini&s;trators. The &s;ame &s;pirit of enquiry is now leading the people to change the form of their governments, that &s;ociety may be re&s;tored to its proper foundation, the general hap|pine&s;s of the great community of men.</P>
<P>On examining the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of principles which mark the character of the times through the&s;e different periods, it appears that, when the &s;pirit of commerce had become predominant, the only engine of &s;tate, which could be relied upon to excite the people to war, was the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a national credit by funding the national debts. And we &s;hould not be wide from the truth in a&s;|&s;erting, that to the funding &s;y&s;tem alone the prin|cipal commercial nations of Europe are to attribute the wars of the pre&s;ent century, as well as the enormous debts under which they have learned to &s;truggle.</P>
<P>Such have been the effects of funding, under the old forms of governments; and having a&s;cer|tained the principles on which it has operated in producing the&s;e effects, we &s;hall be better able to determine whether it be admi&s;&s;ible in the policy of a free republic. In this great cri&s;is of human affairs, it behoves mankind to probe the wounds of nature to the bottom, and remove every excre|&s;cence which might prevent a perfect cure.</P>
<P>Men of contemplative minds, as well as tho&s;e of practical knowledge, have now become &s;o ge|nerally agreed in the nece&s;&s;ity of the funding &s;y&s;|tem, that, though they di&s;cern the evils to which it mu&s;t expo&s;e a nation, I fear it is one of the la&s;t of their e&s;tabli&s;hed maxims that they will be wil|ling to &s;ubject to the &s;everity of di&s;cu&s;&s;ion. The univer&s;al opinion is that a &s;tate cannot exi&s;t with|out a national credit; unle&s;s it put it&s;elf to the
<PB N="154" REF="030026_0153_0FE4029CA8725308">
di&s;advantage of hoarding up money, and keeping a trea&s;ure in re&s;erve. And this latter mea&s;ure, be&s;ides the inconvenience above-mentioned, of lo&s;ing the u&s;e of the capital while it lies inactive, would throw into the hands of the executive go|vernment, the &s;ame dangerous power which is entru&s;ted to them by the means of credit. In this re&s;pect their rea&s;oning is ju&s;t; and perhaps a full trea&s;ury would be the greate&s;t evil of the two.</P>
<P>But after all, what is the advantage of a na<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ion|al credit? I mean in the &s;en&s;e in which it is gen|erally under&s;tood, the facility of rai&s;ing a capital on long annuities, by a mor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">gage of revenue. Shall we not find on an inve&s;tigation of this very &s;imple que&s;tion, that the advantage derived from &s;uch a credit (even &s;uppo&s;ing it never to be abu&s;ed) can only be applicable to the old &s;y&s;tems of gov|ernment? Will it not appear that it is an advan|tage totally unnece&s;&s;ary to a rational and manly admini&s;tration, conducted by the wi&s;hes of a free and enlightened people?

This people will never engage in any offen&s;ive war. Indeed, as &s;oon as the &s;urrounding nation<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> adopt the &s;ame change of government, the bu&s;ine&s;s of war will be forgotten; but in the interval&punc; previous to this event, a real republic cannot &s;tand in need of funds, as a preparative for wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> unle&s;s it be invaded.

But the cal|culation does not turn on the cabinet-rules of royal arithmetic; the power of the republic for the purpo&s;e of defence does not depend on a national credit, in the &s;en&s;e above-mentioned, or the fa|cility of borrowing money; the government, in making up its e&s;timate of re&s;i&s;tance, never a&s;ks, How many &s;oldiers have we in pay?

It is true in nature, and the truth mu&s;t prove it&s;elf beyond contradiction to the world, as &s;oon as it &s;hall have opportunity to judge, that a great people accu&s;tomed to exerci&s;e their rights, would never violate their duties.</P>

<HEAD>A LETTER TO THE NATIONAL CONVENTION OF FRANCE, On the defects in the Con&s;titution of <HI>1791,</HI> and the extent of the amendments which ought to be applied.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>LONDON,
<DATE><HI>September</HI> 16, 1792.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE time is at la&s;t arrived, when the people of France, by re&s;orting to their own pro|per dignity, feel them&s;elves at liberty to exerci&s;e their embarra&s;&s;ed rea&s;on, in e&s;tabli&s;hing an equal government. The pe&s;ent cri&s;is in your affairs, marked by the a&s;&s;embling of a National Conven|tion, bears nearly the &s;ame relation to the la&s;t four years of your hi&s;to<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">, as your whole revolu|tion bears to the great accumulated ma&s;s of mod|ern improvement. Compared therefore with all that is pa&s;t, it is perhaps the mo&s;t intere&s;ting por|tion of the mo&s;t important period that Europe has hitherto &s;een.</P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="030026_0158_0FE402AD1572A578">Under this impre&s;&s;ion, and with the deepe&s;t &s;en&s;e of the magnitude of the &s;ubject which is to engage your attention, I take a liberty which no &s;light motives could warrant in a &s;tranger, the liberty of offering a few ob&s;ertions on the bu&s;ine&s;s that lies before you. Could I &s;uppo&s;e however, that any apology were nece&s;&s;ary for this intru&s;ion, I &s;hould not rely upon the one here mentioned. But my intentions require no apology; I demand to be heard, as a right. Your cau&s;e is that of hu|man nature at large; you are the repre&s;entatives of mankind; and though I am not literally one of your con&s;tituents, yet I mu&s;t be bound by your decrees. My happine&s;s will be &s;eriou&s;ly affected by your deliberations; and in them I have an in|tere&s;t which nothing can de&s;troy. I not only con|&s;ider all mankind as forming but one great family, and therefore bound by a natural &s;ympathy to re|gard each other's happine&s;s as making part of their own&punc; but I contemplate the French nation at this moment as &s;tanding in the place of the whole. You have &s;tepped forward with a gigantic &s;tride to an enterprize which involves the intere&s;t of every &s;urrounding nation; and what you began as ju&s;|tice to your&s;elves, you are called upon to fini&s;h as a duty to the human race.</P>
<P>I believe no man cheri&s;hes a greater veneration, than I have uniformly done, for the National A&s;&s;embly who framed the con&s;titution, which I now pre&s;ume your con&s;tituents expect you to re|vi&s;e. Perhaps the mer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">s of that body of men will never be properly appreciated. The greate&s;t part of their exertions were nece&s;&s;arily &s;pent on objects which cannot be de&s;cribed; and which from their nature can make no figure in hi&s;tory. The enor|mous weight of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">&s;es they had to overturn, the
<PB N="161" REF="030026_0159_0FE40326F8D32A38">
quantity of prejudice with which their functions called then to contend, as well in their own minds as in tho&s;e of all the European world, the open oppo&s;ition of intere&s;ts, the &s;ecret weapons of cor|ruption, and the unbridled fury of de&s;pairing fac|tion&mdash;the&s;e are &s;ubjects which e&s;cape our common ob&s;ervation, when we contemplate the labors of that A&s;&s;embly. But the legacy they have left to their country in their deliberative capacity will remain a la&s;ting monument to their prai&s;e; and though while &s;earching out the defective parts of their work, without lo&s;ing &s;ight of the difficulties under which it was formed, we may find more occa&s;ion to admire its wi&s;dom, than to murmur at its faults; yet this con&s;ideration ought not to deter us from the attempt.</P>
<P>The great leading principle, on which their con&s;titution was meant to be founded, is <HI>the equal|ity of rights.</HI> This principle being laid down with &s;uch clearne&s;s, and a&s;&s;erted with &s;o much dig|nity in the beginning of the code, it is &s;trange that men of clear under&s;tandings &s;hould fail to be charmed with the beauty of the &s;y&s;tem which na|ture mu&s;t have taught them to build on that found|ation. It &s;hows a di&s;po&s;ition to counteract the analogy of nature, to &s;ee them at one moment, impre&s;&s;ing this indelible principle on our minds, and with the next breath declaring, That France &s;hall remain a mon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rchy,&mdash;that it &s;hall have a king, hereditary, inviolable, clothed with all the executive, and much of the legi&s;lative power, commander in chief of all the national force by land and &s;ea, having the initiative of war, and the power of concluding peace;&mdash;and above all, to hear them declare that, "The nation will provide for the &s;plendour of the throne," granting in their
<PB N="162" REF="030026_0160_0FE402B36C74E3D0">
legi&s;lative capacity to that throne more than a million &s;terling a year, from the national pur&s;e, be&s;ides the rents of e&s;tates which are &s;aid to amount to half as much more.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t be a&s;toni&s;hed at the paradoxical or|ganization of the minds of men who could &s;ee no di&s;cordance in the&s;e ideas. They begin with the open &s;implicity of a rational republic, and imme|diately plunge into all the labyrinths of royalty; and a great part of the con&s;titutional code is a practical attempt to reconcile the&s;e two di&s;cordant theories. It is a perpetual conflict between prin|ciple and precedent,&mdash;between the manly truths of nature, which we all mu&s;t feel, and the learned &s;ubtilties of &s;tate&s;men, about which we have been taught to rea&s;on.</P>
<P>In reviewing the hi&s;tory of human opinions, it is an unplea&s;ant con&s;ideration to remark how &s;low the mind has always been in &s;eizing the mo&s;t in|tere&s;ting truths; although, when di&s;covered, they appear to have been the mo&s;t obvious. This re|mark is no where verified with more circum&s;tan|ces of regret, than in the progre&s;s of your ideas in France relative to the inutility of the kingly office. It was not enough that you took your fir&s;t &s;tand upon the high ground of natural right; where, enlightened by the &s;un of rea&s;on, you might have &s;een the coulds of prejudice roll far beneath your feet&mdash;it w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s not enough that you began by con&s;idering royalty, with its well-known &s;courges, as being the cau&s;e of all your evils,&mdash;that the kings of modern Europe are the authors of war and mi&s;ery, that their mutual in|tercour&s;e is a commerce of human &s;laughter,&mdash;that public debts and private oppre&s;&s;ions, with all the degrading vices that tarni&s;h the face of nature, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">

their origin in that &s;pecies of government which offers a premium for wickedne&s;s, and teaches the few to trample on the many;&mdash;it was not enough that you &s;aw the means of a regeneration of man|kind in the &s;y&s;tem of equal rights, and that in a wealthy and powerful nation you po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the ad|vantage of reducing that &s;y&s;tem to immediate practice, as an example to the world and a con&s;o|lation to human nature. All the&s;e arguments, with a variety of others which your republican orators placed in the &s;tronge&s;t point of light, were in&s;ufficient to rai&s;e the public mind to a proper view of the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>It &s;eems that &s;ome of your own philo&s;ophers had previou&s;ly taught, that royalty was nece&s;&s;ary to a great nation. Monte&s;quieu, among his whim&s;ical maxims about laws and government, had informed the world that a limited monarchy was the be&s;t po&s;&s;ible &s;y&s;tem, and that a democracy could never flouri&s;h, but in a &s;mall tract of coun|try. How many of your legi&s;lators believed in this doctrine, how many acted from tempori&s;ing motives, wi&s;hing to bani&s;h royalty by &s;low de|grees, and how many were led by principles le&s;s pardonable than either, it is impo&s;&s;ible to deter|mine. Certain it is, that republican ideas gained no ground upon the monarchial in your con&s;titu|ent a&s;&s;embly, during the la&s;t &s;ix months of their deliberations. It is likewi&s;e certain that the ma|jority of that a&s;&s;embly took much pains to prevent the people from di&s;covering the cheat of royalty, and to continue their ancient veneration, at lea&s;t for a while, in favour of certain principles in government which rea&s;on could not approve.</P>
<P>It is remarkable that all the perfidy of your king, at the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">me of his flight, &s;hould have had &s;o
<PB N="164" REF="030026_0162_0FE402B8EF1ADE50">
little effect in opening the eyes of &s;o enlightened a people as the French. His flight, and the in|&s;ulting declaration which he left behind him, were &s;ufficient not only to give the lie to the fiction, with which common &s;en&s;e has always been put to the blu&s;h, and to which your a&s;&s;embly had at|tempted to give a &s;anction, <HI>that kings can do no wrong,</HI> but they were &s;ufficient to &s;how, at lea&s;t to all who would open their eyes, that the bu&s;ine&s;s of gov|ernment required no &s;uch officer. There is no period during your revolution, if there is any to be found in the hi&s;tory of France, when bu&s;ine&s;s went on with more alacrity and good order, than during the &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of the royal functions in the interval from the time that the king was brought back to the capital in June, till the completion of the con&s;titution in September. Every thing went right in the kingdom, except within the walls of the a&s;&s;embly. A majority of that body was deter|mined to make an experiment of a limited mon|archy. The experiment has been made. Its duration has indeed been &s;hort, being le&s;s than eleven months; but, although in &s;ome re&s;pects it has been almo&s;t as fatal to the cau&s;e of liberty as any &s;y&s;tem could have been within the time, yet in other re&s;pects it has done more good than all the rea&s;onings of all the philo&s;ophers of the age could have done in a much longer time: it has taught them a new doctrine, which no experience can &s;hake, and which rea&s;on mu&s;t confirm, <HI>that kings can do no good.</HI> So that, if the que&s;tion were now to be agitated by the people of France, as it may be by you in their behalf, whether they will have a king or not, I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e the following would be the &s;tate of the calculation: A cretain quantity of evils are to be expected from the regal office; and
<PB N="165" REF="030026_0163_0FE403308D44C250">
the&s;e evils are of of two cla&s;&s;es, <HI>certain</HI> and <HI>proba|ble.</HI> The <HI>certain</HI> evils are, 1. The million and a half &s;terling a year drawn from the people to "&s;upport the &s;plendour of the throne;" 2. A great variety of enormous &s;alaries paid to mini&s;|ters at home, to amba&s;&s;adors abroad, and to bi&s;h|ops in the church; while the only bu&s;ine&s;s of the&s;e men and their &s;alaries is to &s;upport the fic|tion, that kings can do no wrong. It will always co&s;t more to &s;upport this fiction, than it would to &s;upport the whole national government without it. 3. The wor&s;t of all the certain evils is, that a great part of the million and a half will be &s;pent in bribery and corruption among the members of the legi&s;lature, to increa&s;e the power of the throne, and the means of oppre&s;&s;ion. If the mo|ney, after it is extorted from the people, could be thrown into the &s;ea, in&s;tead of being paid to the king and his &s;atellites, the evil would be trifling; in that ca&s;e the wickedne&s;s would cea&s;e with the fir&s;t act of inju&s;tice; while in this it multiplies the weapons of de&s;truction again&s;t them&s;elves. It creates a perpetual &s;crambling for power, re|wards knavery in the higher ranks, encourages fal&s;ehood in others, and corrupts the morals of the whole. This it is that deba&s;es and vilifies the general ma&s;s of mankind, and brings upon them the in&s;ulting remarks of many men, who even wi&s;h them well, <HI>that the people are unfit for liberty.</HI></P>
<P>Among the <HI>probable</HI> evils re&s;ulting from the kingly office, the principal one, and indeed the only one that need to be mentioned, is the chance of its being held by a <HI>weak or a wicked man.</HI>&mdash; When the office is hereditary, it is &s;carcely to be expected but that this &s;hould always be the ca&s;e. Con&s;idering the birth and education of princes,
<PB N="166" REF="030026_0164_0FE402BEA3A8EFD0">
the change of finding one with practical common &s;en&s;e is hardly to be reckoned among po&s;&s;ible events; nor is the probability le&s;s &s;trong again&s;t their having virtue. The temptations to wick|edne&s;s ari&s;ing from their &s;ituation are too powerful to be re&s;i&s;ted. The per&s;ua&s;ive arts of all their flat|terers, the companions of their youth, the mini&s;|ters of their plea&s;ures, and every per&s;on with whom they ever conver&s;e, are nece&s;&s;arily employ|ed to induce them to increa&s;e their revenue, by oppre&s;&s;ing the people, whom they are taught from their cradle to con&s;ider as bea&s;ts of burthen. And what mu&s;t almo&s;t in&s;ure the triumph of wicked|ne&s;s is their tempers, is the idea that they act to|tally and forever without re&s;traint. This is an allurement to vice that even men of &s;en&s;e could &s;carcely re&s;i&s;t. Impre&s;s it on the mind of any man that he <HI>can do no wrong,</HI> and he will &s;oon con|vince you of your mi&s;take.</P>
<P>Take this general &s;ummary of the evils ari&s;ing from hereditary monarchy, under any re&s;trictions that can be propo&s;ed, and place it on one &s;ide of the account,&mdash;and &s;tate, on the other &s;ide, the truth which I believe no man of reflection will hereafter call in que&s;tion, <HI>that kings can do no good,</HI> and the friends of liberty will no longer be in doubt which way you will decide the que&s;tion relative to that part of your con&s;titution.</P>
<P>I cannot feel ea&s;y in di&s;mi&s;&s;ing this part of my &s;ubject, without offering &s;ome remarks on that general vauge idea which has long been floating about in the world, that a people under certain circum&s;tances are unfit for liberty. You know in what in&s;ulting language this ob&s;ervation has been perpetually applied to the French during the cour&s;e of the revolution. Some have &s;aid that they
<PB N="167" REF="030026_0165_0FE403361F2DC7F0">
were too <HI>ignorant</HI> to form a government of their own, others that they were too <HI>poor,</HI> others that they were too <HI>numerous,</HI> and others that they were too <HI>vitious.</HI> I will not de&s;cend to the examination of the particular parts of this charge, nor of the whole as applied to the French, or to any other particular people; I will only remark on the gen|eral ob&s;ervation, as applicable to any po&s;&s;ible na|tion exi&s;ting in a &s;tate of nature. By a &s;tate of nature I mean a &s;tate of peace; where the i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">en|tion is, as a nation, to live by indu&s;try at home, not by plunder from abroad.</P>
<P>I think Monte&s;quieu has &s;aid, that virtue mu&s;t be the foundation of a republican government. His book is not now by me, or I would try to di&s;cover what he means by virtue. If he means tho&s;e moral habits by which men are di&s;po&s;ed to mutual ju&s;tice and benevolence, which is the com|mon idea of virtue, it cannot be the foundation of a republican government, or of any government. The&s;e qualities require no re&s;traints: the more general their influence &s;hould be among any peo|ple, the le&s;s force would be nece&s;&s;ary in their go|vernment; and could we &s;uppo&s;e a nation in which they &s;hould exi&s;t in a perfect degree, that nation would require no government at all. It is the vices, not the virtues of men which are the objects of re&s;traint, and the foundation of government. The expre&s;&s;ion of the general will, operating on the mind of an individual, &s;erves with him as a &s;ub&s;titute for virtue. This general will may al|ways be expre&s;&s;ed by a nation in any po&s;&s;ible cir|cum&s;tances; and, if the nation be in a &s;tate of nature, this expre&s;&s;ion will alway be <HI>moral virtue,</HI> according to their ideas of the word; and it will
<PB N="168" REF="030026_0166_0FE402C1D6A4BCD8">
always <HI>tend</HI> to moral virtue, in the mo&s;t exten&s;ive &s;en&s;e in which we have yet been able to define it.</P>
<P>It has been &s;aid, that man differs from man, as much as man from bea&s;t; it is &s;aid al&s;o to be fit, that the wi&s;e and virtuous &s;hould make laws for the i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">norant and vitious. It is not to my purpo&s;e to call in que&s;tion the fir&s;t of the&s;e a&s;&s;ertions; but the &s;econd, plau&s;ible as it is, I mu&s;t totally deny; at lea&s;t in the &s;en&s;e in which it is generally under|&s;too<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. That &s;ome men in the &s;ame &s;ociety &s;hould be wi&s;er and better than others, is very natural; and it is as natural, that the people &s;hould choo&s;e &s;uch to repre&s;ent them in the formation of laws. But in this ca&s;e the laws originate from the people at large, ignorant and vitious as they are; and the repre&s;entatives are only the organs by which their will is declared. This is not the &s;en&s;e in which the a&s;&s;ertion is intended. It is meant, that if kings were always wi&s;e and good, or if a band of nobles were always wi&s;e and good, it would be be&s;t that they &s;hould be the hereditary legi&s;lators. This is the &s;en&s;e in which I deny the a&s;&s;ertion, becau&s;e it is contrary to the analogy of nature. It being a &s;ubject on which we cannot look for ex|perience, we mu&s;t rea&s;on only from analogy; and it appears extremely evident to me, that, were a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the wi&s;e&s;t and be&s;t men that ever have, or ever will be known, to be perpetuated in any country as independent legi&s;lators for the people, the happine&s;s and government of the nation would be greatly injured by it. I am confident that any people, whether virtuous or vitious, wi&s;e or igno|rant, numerous or few, rich or poor, are the be&s;t jedges of their own wants relative to the re&s;traint of laws, and would always &s;upply tho&s;e wants better than <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> could be &s;upplied by others.</P>
<P><PB N="169" REF="030026_0167_0FE4033ADC0CE880">In expre&s;&s;ing the&s;e ideas on the peace and hap|pine&s;s to be expected from a free republic, I have been often accu&s;ed of holding too favourable an opinion of human nature. But it appears to me, that the que&s;tion, whether men, on any given portion of the earth, are able to make their own laws, does not depend in the lea&s;t on their moral character. It has no relation to their &s;tate of im|provement or their &s;tate of morals. The only previous enquiry is, What is the object to be aimed at in the government? If it be the good of the whole community, the whole can be&s;t know the means of pur&s;uing it; if it be to exalt a few men at the expence of all the re&s;t, the deci&s;ion, perhaps, may take a different turn.</P>
<P>A republic of beavers or of monkies, I believe, could not be benefited by receiving their laws from men, any more than men could be in being governed by them. If the Algerines or the Hin|doos were to &s;hake off the yoke of de&s;poti&s;m, and adopt ideas of equal liberty, they would that mo|ment be in a condition to frame a better govern|ment for them&s;elves, than could be framed for them by the mo&s;t learned &s;tate&s;men in the world.

<P>Colonies have always been teazed and torment|ed more or le&s;s (and probably always will be as long as colonies &s;hall exi&s;t) by the overweening wi&s;dom of the mother-country, in making their laws and con&s;titutions.

lies in the legi&s;lator's not knowing the wants and wi&s;hes of the people, than in any wanton de&s;ire to counteract them. The &s;ure and only charac|teri&s;tic of a good law is, <HI>that it be the perfect ex|pre&s;&s;ion of the will of the nation</HI>; its excellence is preci&s;ely in proportion to the univer&s;ality and freedom of con&s;ent. And this definition remains the &s;ame, whatever be the character of the nation, or the object of the law. Every man, as an indi|vidual, has a will of his own, and a manner of expre&s;&s;ing it. In forming the&s;e individuals into &s;ociety, it is nece&s;&s;ary to form their wills into a government; and in doing this, we have only to find the ea&s;ie&s;t and cleare&s;t mode of expre&s;&s;ing their wills in a national manner. And no po&s;&s;ible di&s;|advantages relative to their &s;tate of morals or civil|ization can render this a difficult ta&s;k.</P>
<P>I have gone into the&s;e arguments, not merely to prove that the <HI>French</HI> are fit for liberty, who are certainly at this moment the mo&s;t enlightened nation in Europe, but to &s;how that the calumny contained in the contrary a&s;&s;ertion need not be re|peated again&s;t any other nation, who &s;hould make the like exertions, and who&s;e preten&s;ions, in this re&s;pect, might appear more que&s;tionable in the eye of fa&s;hionable remark.</P>

character the &s;tain which it received, with its veneration for kings and hereditary claims. But it requires much reflection to be well aware to what extent this duty &s;hould carry you. There are many vices in your con&s;titution, which though not opparently connected with the king, had their origin in regal ideas. To purify the whole code from the&s;e vices, and to purge human nature from their effects, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to re&s;ort to many principles which appear not to have &s;truck the minds of the fir&s;t a&s;&s;embly.</P>
<P>You will permit me to hint at &s;ome of the great outlines of what may be expected from you, un|der the peculiar advantages with which you meet to form a glorious republic. Although many of my ideas may be perfectly &s;uperfluous, being the &s;ame as will occur to every member of your body, yet it is po&s;&s;ible that &s;ome of them may &s;trike the mind in a new point of light, and lead to reflec|tions which would not ri&s;e from any other quar|ter.

<P>On con&s;idering the &s;ubject of government, when the mind is once &s;et loo&s;e from the &s;hackles of royalty, it finds it&s;elf in a new world. It ri&s;es to a more exten&s;ive view of every circum&s;tance of the &s;ocial &s;tate. Human nature a&s;&s;umes a new and more elevated &s;hape, and di&s;plays many mor|al features, which, from having been always di&s;|gui&s;ed, were not known to exi&s;t. In this ca&s;e, it is a long time before we acquire a habit of tra|cing effects to their proper cau&s;es, and of apply|ing the ea&s;y and &s;imple remedy to tho&s;e vices of our nature which &s;ociety requires us to re&s;train.

This, I apprehend, is the &s;ource of by far the greate&s;t difficulties with which you have to con|tend. We are &s;o much u&s;ed, in government, to the mo&s;t complicated &s;y&s;tems, as being nece&s;&s;ary to &s;upport tho&s;e impo&s;itions, without which it has been &s;uppo&s;ed impo&s;&s;ible for men to be governed, that it is an unu&s;ual ta&s;k to conceive of the &s;impli|city to which the bu&s;ine&s;s of government may be reduced, and to which it mu&s;t be reduced, if we would have it an&s;wer the purpo&s;e of promoting happine&s;s.</P>
<P>After pro&s;cribing royalty, with all its append|ages, I &s;uppo&s;e it will not be thought nece&s;&s;ary in France to &s;upport any other errors and &s;uper|&s;titions of a &s;imilar complection; but that undi&s;|gui&s;ed rea&s;on in all things will be preferred to the cloak of impo&s;ition. Should this be the ca&s;e, you will conceive it no longer nece&s;&s;ary to maintain a <HI>national church.</HI> This e&s;tabli&s;hment is &s;o mani|fe&s;tly an impo&s;ition upon the judgment of man|kind, that the con&s;tituent a&s;&s;embly mu&s;t have con|&s;idered it in that light. It is one of tho&s;e mon|archial ideas, which pay us the wretched compli|ment of &s;uppo&s;ing that we are not capable of being governed by our own rea&s;on. To &s;uppo&s;e that the people of France are to learn the mode of wor|&s;hipping God from the decrees of the council of Trente, is certainly as ab&s;urd as it would be to appeal to &s;uch a council to learn how to breathe, or to open their eyes. Neither is it true, as is ar|gued by the advocates of this part of your con|&s;titution, that the preference there given to one mode of wor&s;hip by the payment of the catholic prie&s;ts, from the national pur&s;e, to the exclu&s;ion of others, was founded on the idea of the proper|ty &s;uppo&s;ed to have been po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by that church,
<PB N="173" REF="030026_0171_0FE4034414A1E028">
and which by the a&s;&s;embly was declared to be thenceforward the property of the nation.</P>
<P>The church, in this &s;en&s;e of the word, &s;ignifies nothing but a <HI>mode of wor&s;hip</HI>; and to prove that a mode can be the proprietor of lands, requires a &s;ubtilty of logic that I &s;hall not attempt to re|fute. The fact is, the church con&s;idered as an <HI>hierarchy,</HI> was always nece&s;&s;ary to the &s;upport of royalty; and your a&s;&s;embly, with great con&s;i&s;ten|cy of de&s;ign, wi&s;hing to pre&s;erve &s;omething of the old fabric, pre&s;erved &s;omething of this nece&s;&s;ary prop. But as the fabric is now overturned, the prop may be &s;afely taken away. I am confident that monarchy and hierarchy will be buried in the &s;ame grave; and that in France they will not &s;urvive the pre&s;ent year.</P>
<P>I know that it is a&s;&s;erted and believed by &s;ome well-wi&s;hers to &s;ociety, that religion would be lo&s;t among men, if they were to bani&s;h all legal e&s;tabli&s;hments with regard to the manner of exer|ci&s;ing it. I &s;hould not be &s;o perfectly convinced as I am of the ab&s;urdity of this opinion, were it not ea&s;y to di&s;cover how it came to be introduced. It is an idea, as I believe, purely political; and it had its origin in the &s;uppo&s;ed nece&s;&s;ity of gov|erning men by fraud,&mdash;of erecting their credulity into an hierarchy, in order to &s;u&s;tain the de&s;poti&s;m of the &s;tate. I hold religion to be a natural propen|&s;ity of the mind, as re&s;piration is of the lungs. If this be true, there can be no danger of its being lo&s;t: and I can &s;ee no more rea&s;on for making laws to regulate the impre&s;&s;ion of Deity upon the &s;oul, than there would be, to regulate the action of light upon the eye, or of air upon the lungs.

<P>Much has been &s;aid, &s;ince the beginning of your revolution, on the difference between the bu&s;ine&s;s of framing con&s;titutions, and that of ordinary legi&s;lation. Indeed I am afraid that either too much or too little has been inculcated on this &s;ub|ject; becau&s;e it appears to me, that the doctrine now received is not that which the &s;ubject would naturally &s;ugge&s;t. It teaches us to con&s;ider tho&s;e laws that are called <HI>con&s;titutions,</HI> in a light &s;o &s;ac|red, as to &s;avour too much of the old leaven of veneration for precedent; and every degree of &s;uch veneration is &s;o much taken from the chance of improvement. To &s;uppo&s;e that our predece&s;&s;ors were wi&s;er than our&s;elves is not an extraordinary thing, though the opinion may be ill founded; but to &s;uppo&s;e that they can have left us a better &s;y&s;tem of political regulations than we can make for our&s;elves, is to a&s;cribe to them a degree of di&s;cernment to which our own bears no compari|&s;on; it &s;uppo&s;es them to have known our condi|dition by prophecy better than we know it by ex|perience.</P>
<P>There was not only a degree of arrogance in your fir&s;t a&s;&s;embly, in &s;uppo&s;ing that they had framed a con&s;titution, which for a number of years would require no amendment; but they be|trayed a great degree of weakne&s;s in imagining
<PB N="175" REF="030026_0173_0FE4034A3558A590">
that the ridiculous barriers with which they fenced it round would be &s;ufficient to re&s;train the power|ful weight of opinion, and prevent the people from exerci&s;ing the irre&s;i&s;tible right at innovation, whenever experience &s;hould di&s;cover the defects of the &s;y&s;tem. It is partly to the&s;e barriers, as well as to the inherent vices of the con&s;titution, that we are to attribute the late in&s;urrections in Paris. If we would trace the cau&s;es of popular commotions, we &s;hould always find them to have originated in a previous unju&s;t re&s;traint.</P>
<P>I would not however be under&s;tood to mean that there &s;hould be no di&s;tinction between the con&s;ti|tutional code, and other occa&s;ional laws. There is room for a con&s;iderable difference, both as to the mode of expre&s;&s;ing them, and as to the form|alities proper to be ob&s;erved in repealing or amend|ing them. I will offer &s;ome remarks on a plan for amendments towards the clo&s;e of my letter. With regard to the general complection of the code, it ought to be as &s;imply expre&s;&s;ed and ea&s;y to be under&s;tood as po&s;&s;ible; for it ought to &s;erve not only as a guide to the legi&s;lative body, but as a political grammar to all the citizens. The great|e&s;t &s;ervice to be expected from it is, that it &s;hould concentrate the maxims, and form the habits of thinking, for the whole community. For this purpo&s;e, it is not &s;ufficient that it be purified from every ve&s;tige of monarchy, and hierarchy, with all the impo&s;itions and inequalities which have &s;prung in&s;en&s;ibly from the&s;e ideas; but it &s;hould contemplate the whole circle of human propen&s;i|ties, and cut off the temptations and opportunities for degenerating into tho&s;e evils which have &s;o long afflicted mankind, and from which we are now but beginning to ari&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="176" REF="030026_0174_0FE402D760107730">After laying down the great fundamental prin|ciple <HI>that all men art equal in their rights,</HI> it ought to be the invariable object of the &s;ocial compact to in&s;ure the exerci&s;e of that equality, by rendering them as equal in all &s;orts of enjoyments, as can po&s;&s;ibly be con&s;i&s;tent with good order, indu&s;try, and the reward of merit.

On this un|deniable maxim, I think the following po&s;itions ought to be founded and guaranteed in the con&s;ti|tutional code:</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> The only ba&s;is of repre&s;entation in the government &s;hould be <HI>population</HI>; territory and property, though ab&s;urdly &s;tated by your fir&s;t a&s;|&s;embly as making part of the ba&s;is of repre&s;enta|tion, have no intere&s;t in it. Property, in it&s;elf, conveys no right to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, but the right of enjoying it. To &s;ay that it has the right of claim|ing for it&s;elf the protection of &s;ociety, is ab&s;urd; becau&s;e it is already protected, or it would not be property. It is the <HI>per&s;on,</HI> not the property, that exerci&s;es the will, and is capable of enjoying happine&s;s; it is therefore the per&s;on, for whom government is in&s;tituted, and by whom its func|tions are performed. The rea&s;on why property has been con&s;idered as conveying additional rights to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or in matters of government, is the &s;ame as has blinded the under&s;tandings of men relative to the whole order of nature in &s;ociety. It is one of tho&s;e appendages of monarchy and oligarchy, which teaches that the object of gov|ernment is to increa&s;e the &s;plendour of the few, and the misfortunes of the many. And every &s;tep that &s;uch governments take has a tendency to
<PB N="177" REF="030026_0175_0FE4034DD1BD2340">
counteract the equality of rights, by de&s;troying the equality of enjoyments.</P>
<P><HI>Second,</HI> If you take population as the only ba&s;is of repre&s;entation in the departments, the next &s;tep will be, to declare every independent man to be an active citizen. By an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">dependent man, I mean every man whom the laws do not place under the control of another, by rea&s;on of nonage or do|me&s;ticity. The laws of France, in my opinion, have always placed the period of majority by &s;e|veral years too late; that is, later than nature has placed it. This however, was of little con&s;equence in a political view, as long as the government re|mained de&s;potic; but now, when the rights of man are re&s;tored, and government is built on that foun|dation, it is of con&s;equence to encrea&s;e as far as po&s;&s;ible the number of active citizens. And for this purpo&s;e I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e the period of majo|rity ought to be placed at lea&s;t as early as the age of twenty years. To make this change in France would be attended with many advantages. It would increa&s;e the &s;tock of knowledge, and of indu&s;try, by in&s;piring young men with early ideas of independence, and the nece&s;&s;ity of providing for them&s;elves by &s;ome u&s;eful employment: it would be a great inducement to early marriages, and, by that means, increa&s;e population, and en|courage purity of morals.</P>
<P>I am likewi&s;e fully convinced that the a&s;&s;embly was wrong in &s;uppo&s;ing that a &s;tate of dome&s;ticity ought to deprive a man of the rights of a freeman. This is a relick of tho&s;e ideas which the ancient government has in&s;pired. Where a &s;ervant is ab&s;olutely dependent on the caprice of a ma&s;ter for his place, and con&s;equently for his bread, there is indeed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">uch force in the argument, that he can
<PB N="178" REF="030026_0176_0FE402DCF8775E38">
have no political will of his own; and will give his &s;uffrage as directed by the ma&s;ter. But when every man &s;hall be ab&s;olutely free to follow any pro|fe&s;&s;ion, every kind of u&s;eful indu&s;try being equally encouraged and rewarded; and e&s;pecially when every man &s;hall be well in&s;tructed in his duties and his rights, which will certainly be the con&s;equence of the &s;y&s;tem you have now begun,&mdash;&s;uch argu|ments will fall to the ground with the &s;y&s;tem which they &s;upport. The &s;ervant and his ma&s;ter, though not equal in property or in talents, may be perfectly &s;o in freedom and in virtue. Wherever the &s;ervant is more dependent on the ma&s;ter, than the ma&s;ter on the &s;ervant, there is &s;omething wrong in the government. The &s;ame remarks I believe may be repeated, with little variation, in the ca&s;e of in&s;olvent debtors, another cla&s;s of men di&s;|franchi&s;ed by the fir&s;t a&s;&s;embly.</P>
<P><HI>Third,</HI> The manner in which citizen&s;hip may be acquired or lo&s;t, is a &s;ubject which ought to be con&s;idered by you; as your predece&s;&s;ors have left in it &s;ome room for improvement. Their regu|lation was indeed a liberal one, compared with what other governments have done; but not &s;o, when compared with what the &s;ubject required. I am confident that when &s;ociety &s;hall be placed on the right footing, the citizens of any one &s;tate will con&s;ider tho&s;e of any other &s;tate as their brothers and fellow citizens of the world; and in this ca&s;e, when tho&s;e who are called foreigners come to &s;et|tle among them, a mere declaration of their in|tention of re&s;idence will be &s;ufficient to entitle them to all the rights which the natives po&s;&s;e&s;s. I was anxious that the French &s;hould &s;et the example in this &s;pecies of liberality, as they have done in
<PB N="179" REF="030026_0177_0FE4035423415078">
&s;o many other good things; and I &s;till believe that on reviewing the &s;ubject, you will do it.</P>
<P>But according to your con&s;titution there are many ways in which the rights of citizens may be lo&s;t, for one of which I can &s;ee no rea&s;on; it is naturalization in a foreign country. This is &s;o manife&s;tly illiberal and unju&s;t, that I am almo&s;t &s;ure it will be altered. It is an old feudal idea of allegiance; and goes upon the &s;uppo&s;ition that fidelity to one country is incompatible with our duty to another. When a citizen of one &s;tate is complimented with the freedom of another, it is generally an acknowledgment of his merit; but your con&s;tituent a&s;&s;embly con&s;idered it as an object of puni&s;hment. Many of your citizens have been naturalized in America; but the American go|vernments certainly did not fore&s;ee that this act of theirs would disfranchi&s;e tho&s;e gentlemen at home. You have lately conferred the rights of a French citizen on George Wa&s;hington. If he &s;hould accept the honour you have thus done him, and the American con&s;titution were in this re&s;pect the &s;ame as your own, he mu&s;t immediately be turned out of office, and for ever disfranchi&s;ed at home.</P>
<P><HI>Fourth,</HI> You will doubtle&s;s con&s;ider the import|ant &s;ubject of the <HI>frequency of popular elections,</HI> as claiming a farther deliberation. It is an article on which too much reflection cannot be be&s;towed. It influences the habits of the people and the &s;pirit of the government in a variety of ways, that e&s;cape our common ob&s;ervation. I mentioned before, that one of the fir&s;t objects of &s;ociety is to render every individual perfectly dependent on the whole community. The more completely this object is attained, the more perfect will be the equality of enjoyments and the happine&s;s of the &s;tate. But
<PB N="180" REF="030026_0178_0FE402E0F7D69610">
of all individuals, tho&s;e who are &s;elected to be the organs of the people, in making and in executing the laws, &s;hould feel this dependence in the &s;trong|e&s;t degree. The ea&s;ie&s;t and mo&s;t natural method of effecting this purpo&s;e is, to oblige them to recur frequently to the authors of their official exi&s;tence, to depo&s;it their powers, mingle with their fellows, and wait the deci&s;ion of the &s;ame &s;overeign will which created them at fir&s;t, to know whether they are again to be tru&s;ted.</P>
<P>There are doubtle&s;s &s;ome limits to this frequency of election, beyond which it would be hurtful to pa&s;s; as every &s;ubject has a medium between two vitious extremes. But I know of no office, in any department of &s;tate, that need to be held for more than one year, without a new election. Mo&s;t men, who give in to this idea with re&s;pect to the legi&s;lative, are accu&s;tomed to make an exception with regard to the executive, and particularly with regard to that part which is called the judiciary. I am aware of all the arguments that are u&s;ually brought in &s;upport of the&s;e exceptions; but they appear to me of little weight, in compari&s;on to tho&s;e in favour of univer&s;al annual elections. Power always was, and always mu&s;t be, a danger|ous thing. I mean, power collected from the great ma&s;s of &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ciety, and delegated to a few hands; for it is only in this &s;en&s;e that it can properly be called power. The phy&s;ical forces of all the in|dividuals of a great nation cannot be brought to act at once upon a &s;ingle object; and the &s;ame may be &s;aid of their moral forces. It is nece&s;&s;ary therefore that the exerci&s;e of the&s;e &s;hould always be performed by delegation; the moral in legi&s;la|tion, the phy&s;ical in execution. This is the pro|per definition of national power; and in this &s;en&s;e
<PB N="181" REF="030026_0179_0FE403571F6B4A08">
it is nece&s;&s;arily dangerous; becau&s;e &s;trictly &s;peak|ing, it is not exerci&s;ed by tho&s;e who&s;e property it is, and for who&s;e good it is intended to operate. It is in the nature of this kind of tru&s;t to invert in &s;ome mea&s;ure the order of things; it apparently &s;ets the &s;ervant above the ma&s;ter, and di&s;po&s;es him to feel a kind of independence which ought never to be felt by any citizen, particularly one who is charged with a public function.</P>
<P>It has ever been the tendency of government to divide the &s;ociety into two parties,&mdash;the governors and the governed. The mi&s;chiefs ari&s;ing from this are almo&s;t infinite. It not only di&s;po&s;es each party to view the other with an eye of jealou&s;y and di&s;tru&s;t, which &s;oon ri&s;e to acts of &s;ecret or open enmity, but it effectually corrupts the morals of both parties, and de&s;troys the vital principles of &s;ociety; it makes government the trade of the few, &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion the drudgery of the many, and fal&s;ehood the common artifice of the whole. To prevent this, I would have no man placed in a po|&s;ition in which he can call him&s;elf governor, for a moment longer than while he performs the du|ties of his tru&s;t to the &s;atisfaction of his fellow citizens, nor even then, but for a &s;hort period. He &s;hould feel at all times as though he were &s;oon to change places with any one of his neighbours, whom he now &s;ees &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive to his authority.</P>
<P>But to an&s;wer this purpo&s;e, the frequent return of elections is not of it&s;elf &s;ufficient. I am fully of the opinion, that with regard to all di&s;cretion|ary officers, there ought to be an exclu&s;ion by ro|tation. Tho&s;e functions that are purely mini&s;terial, &s;uch as tho&s;e of &s;heriffs, con&s;tables, clerks of courts, regi&s;ters, &amp;c. perhaps may form excepti|ons; but legi&s;lators, executive coun&s;ellors, judges
<PB N="182" REF="030026_0180_0FE402E6DAE60838">
and magi&s;trates of every de&s;cription, &s;hould not only feel their dependence on the people by an an|nual election, but &s;hould frequently mingle with them by an exclu&s;ion from office. The effect of this would be, not what is often a&s;&s;erted, that no one would under&s;tand government, but the contrary, that every one would under&s;tand it. This would form a prodigious &s;timulus to the acqui&s;ition of knowledge among all de&s;criptions of men, in all parts of the country. Every man of ordinary ability would be not only capable of watching over his own rights, but of exerci&s;ing any of the functions by which the public &s;afety is &s;ecured. For whatever there is in the art of government, whether legi&s;lative or executive, above the capaci|ty of the ordinary cla&s;s of what are called well informed men, is &s;uperfluous and de&s;tructive, and ought to be laid a&s;ide. The man who is called a <HI>politician,</HI> according to the practical &s;en&s;e of the word in modern Europe, exerci&s;es an office infi|nitely more de&s;tructive to &s;ociety than that of a highwayman. The &s;ame may be &s;aid, in general, of the <HI>financier</HI>; who&s;e art and my&s;tery, on the funding &s;y&s;tem of the pre&s;ent century, con&s;i&s;ts in making calculations to enable governments to hire mankind to butcher each other, by drawing bills on po&s;terity for the payment.</P>
<P>I would therefore &s;ugge&s;t the propriety of your reviewing the article of biennial elections, as in|&s;tituted by your fir&s;t a&s;&s;embly, and of your mak|ing them annual; and the &s;ame term, if not the &s;ame manner of election, ought to extend to all executive officers, who&s;e functions are in any manner di&s;cretionary. I think it would likewi&s;e be e&s;&s;ential, that no office of this de&s;cription &s;hould be held by one man, more than two years
<PB N="183" REF="030026_0181_0FE4035D835DD8D0">
in any term of four years. This would &s;end into the departments, and into every part of the em|pire, at frequent periods, &s;ome thou&s;ands of men with practical knowledge of public bu&s;ine&s;s; it would at lea&s;t be the means of doubling the number of &s;uch well-in&s;tructed men; and, by holding out the inducement to others to qualify them&s;elves to merit the confidence of their fellow citizens, it would multiply the number of men of theoretical knowledge, at lea&s;t ten fold. All the&s;e men will be watchful guardians of the public &s;afety. But the&s;e are not all the advantages of frequent elec|tions. They habituate the people to the <HI>bu&s;ine&s;s</HI> of election, and enable them to carry it on with order and regularity, like their daily labour; they habituate the candidates to be gratified with the public confidence, or to be di&s;appointed in the ex|pectation of obtaining it; &s;o that their &s;ucce&s;s or di&s;appointment cea&s;es to make that deep impre&s;|&s;ion on their minds, which it otherwi&s;e would do. It is thus that you would cut off an infinite &s;ource of that intrigue and corruption, which are fore|told with &s;o much horror by tho&s;e who have not well &s;tudied the effects of a well organized popular government. But another method, not le&s;s effec|tual, to prevent the arts of &s;crambling for power and places, will be hinted at in the following article.</P>
<P><HI>Fifth,</HI> Among the fatal mi&s;conceptions of things which monarchy has entailed upon us, and which are extremely difficult to eradicate from the mind, mu&s;t be reckoned that prevalent opinion, that all governments &s;hould gratify their agents with <HI>enor|mous &s;alaries.</HI> This idea has u&s;ually been more particularly applied in favour of the executive offi|cers of government and their dependants; and it
<PB N="184" REF="030026_0182_0FE402EB0DAF3068">
had its origin in the antecedent principles, that government divides the people into two di&s;tinct cla&s;&s;es, and that the &s;ame quantity of bu&s;ine&s;s, coming within the verge of one of the&s;e cla&s;&s;es, mu&s;t be paid for at a higher price than it would be&punc; within that of the other; though it &s;hould be performed by the &s;ame man, and required the &s;ame exertion of talents. Your con&s;titution is &s;ilent as to the quantity of &s;alary that &s;hall be paid to any particular officer; it only &s;ays that "the nation &s;hall provide for the &s;plendour of the throne," (which indeed is a declaration of war again&s;t the liberties of the people) but the authors of that con&s;titution, in their legi&s;lative capacity, after providing for that &s;plendour with a &s;um &s;uf|ficient to purcha&s;e the majority of almo&s;t any corps of &s;even hundred legi&s;lators, went on to pro|vide for the &s;plendour of the mini&s;ters. They gave to one, if my memory does not deceive me, one hundred and fifty thou&s;and livres, and one hundred thou&s;and to each of the re&s;t. This on an average is about three times more than ought to have been given, unle&s;s the object were to carry on the gov|ernment by intriguing for places.</P>
<P>I mention this article, not on the &s;core of oeco|nomy. That con&s;ideration, however weighty it may appear, is one of the lea&s;t that can &s;trike the mind on the &s;ubject of public &s;alaries. The evil of paying too much is pregnant with a thou&s;and mi&s;chiefs. It is almo&s;t &s;ufficient of it&s;elf to de|feat all the advantages to be expected from the in&s;titution of an equal government. The general rule to be adopted in this ca&s;e, (which perhaps is all that can be &s;aid of it in the con&s;titution) ap|pears to me this, <HI>That &s;o much, and no more, &s;hall be given for the performance of any public function,
<PB N="185" REF="030026_0183_0FE4036200E9A480">
as &s;hall be &s;ufficient to induce &s;uch men to undertake it who&s;e abilities are equal to the ta&s;k.</HI> If this rule were &s;trictly ob&s;erved, it is rational to conclude, that there would be no more contention or in|trigue among candidates to obtain places in the government, than there is among manufacturers, to find a market for their goods. This conclu&s;ion becomes more probably ju&s;t, when we con&s;ider that your intention is to cut off from the &s;ervants of the public all hopes of obtaining the public mo|ney by any indirect and fraudulent mea&s;ures. When there &s;hall be no more civil li&s;t, or livre rouge, no more mini&s;terial patronage in church or &s;tate, no more &s;ale of ju&s;tice or purcha&s;e of oppre&s;|&s;ion, or any kind of perqui&s;ite of office, but the candidate &s;hall be a&s;&s;ured, that all the money he &s;hall receive, will be the &s;imple &s;um promi&s;ed by the legi&s;lature, that &s;um being no more than the work is hone&s;tly worth, he will accept or relin|qui&s;h the mo&s;t important tru&s;t, as he would an ordinary occupation.</P>
<P>This &s;ingle circum&s;tance of &s;alaries, being wi&s;ely guarded on every &s;ide, would, in the cour&s;e of its operation, almo&s;t change the moral face of government. It would &s;ilence all the clamours again&s;t the republican principle, and an&s;wer many of the fa&s;hionable calumnies again&s;t the character of the human heart.</P>
<P>There is another que&s;tionable opinion now ex|tant, even in republican countries; which, as it has made &s;ome figure in France, and is connected with the &s;ubject of &s;alaries, I will mention in this place. It is &s;uppo&s;ed to be nece&s;&s;ary, for the energy of government, that its officers &s;hould a&s;|&s;ume a kind of external pomp and &s;plendour, in order to dazzle the eye, and in&s;pire the public
<PB N="186" REF="030026_0184_0FE3F12F45F1BA80">
mind with a veneration for their authority. As this pomp cannot be &s;upported without &s;ome ex|pence, the &s;uppo&s;ed nece&s;&s;ity for a&s;&s;uming it is always offered as a rea&s;on for high &s;alaries; and, allowing the fir&s;t po&s;ition to be true, the con&s;e|quence is certainly rea&s;onable and ju&s;t. If we are to be governed only by deception, it is right that we &s;hould pay for this deception. But the whole argument is wrong; that is, if we allow mon|archy and hierarchy to be wrong; it is a badge of that kind of government which is directly the re|ver&s;e of republican principles, or the government of rea&s;on. I do not deny, that this official pomp has in a great mea&s;ure the effect which is intended from it; it impo&s;es on the unthinking part of mankind, and has a tendency to &s;ecure their obe|dience. This effect, however, is not &s;o great as that of &s;implicity, and the native dignity of rea&s;on would be; but on the moral habits of &s;ociety, its operation is more pernicious than at fir&s;t view we are ready to imagine. So far as the people we caught by the impo&s;ition, it leads them to wrong ideas of them&s;elves, of their officers, and of the real authority of laws. This is a fatal deviation from the true de&s;ign of government; for its prin|cipal object certainly ought to be, to rectify our opinions, and improve our morals.</P>
<P>For my own part, when I &s;ee a man in private life a&s;&s;uming an external &s;plendour, for the &s;ake of gaining attention, I cannot but feel it an in&s;ult offered to my under&s;tanding; becau&s;e it is &s;aying to me, that I have not di&s;cernment enough to di&s;|tingui&s;h his merit, without this kind of <HI>ecce &s;ig|num.</HI> And when an officer of government exhibits him&s;elf in the foppery of a puppet, and is drawn by &s;ix or eight hor&s;es, where two would be really
<PB N="187" REF="030026_0185_0FE40367D3A989F0">
more convenient to him&s;elf, I am grieved at the in&s;ult offered to the nation, and at their &s;tupidity in not perceiving it. For the language of the mummery is &s;imply this, That the officer cannot rely upon his own per&s;onal dignity as a title to re&s;pect, nor the laws be tru&s;ted to their own ju&s;|tice, to in&s;ure their execution. It is a full ac|knowledgment on his part, that the government is bad, and that he is obliged to dazzle the eyes of the people, to prevent their di&s;covering the cheat. When a &s;et of judges on the bench take the pains to &s;hroud their heads and &s;houlders in a fleece of hor&s;e-hair, in order to re&s;emble the bird of wi&s;|dom, it rai&s;es a &s;trong &s;u&s;picion, that they mean to palm upon us the emblem for the reality.</P>
<P>It is e&s;&s;ential to the character of a free republic, that every thing &s;hould be reduced to the &s;tandard of rea&s;on; that men and laws &s;hould depend on their own intrin&s;ic merit, and that no &s;hadow of deception &s;hould ever be offered to the people; as it cannot fail to corrupt them, and pave the way to oppre&s;&s;ion. I make the&s;e remarks, not that they will form an article proper to enter into your con&s;titution, but to remove every appearance of argument in favour of high &s;alaries. And I think the con&s;titution ought to contain a general declara|tion, <HI>that every public &s;alary &s;hould be re&s;tricted to a &s;um not more than &s;ufficient to reward the officer for his labour</HI>; which &s;um mu&s;t, of cour&s;e, be left to be fixed by the legi&s;lature.</P>
<P><HI>Sixth,</HI> There appears to me to be an error of doctrine in France, with re&s;pect to the relation which ought to &s;ub&s;i&s;t between the repre&s;entative, and his immediate con&s;tituents. It is &s;aid, that when a repre&s;entative is once cho&s;en, and &s;ent to the a&s;&s;embly, he is no longer to be con&s;idered as
<PB N="188" REF="030026_0186_0FE402F44F074E28">
repre&s;enting the people of the particular depart|ment which &s;ent him, but of the nation at large; and therefore, during the term for which he is cho&s;en, he is not accountable to the people who cho&s;e him, but is to be controuled, removed or &s;u&s;pended, only by the national a&s;&s;embly. This appears to have been e&s;tabli&s;hed, in order to get rid of a contrary doctrine, which was found to be inconvenient; which was, that a delegate &s;hould be bound at all times to follow the <HI>in&s;tructions</HI> o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> his con&s;tituents; as thereby all the advantages to be expected from di&s;cu&s;&s;ion and deliberation would be lo&s;t. If the fir&s;t of the&s;e be an error, as I be|lieve it is, it may be ea&s;ily avoided, without run|ning into the la&s;t. When the delegate receives in&s;tructions, which prove to be contrary to the opinion which he afterwards forms, he ought to pre&s;ume that his con&s;tituents, not having had the advantage of hearing the national di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, are not well informed on the &s;ubject, and his duty is to vote according to his con&s;cience. It is to be &s;uppo&s;ed that, for his own &s;ake, he will explain to them his motives; but if for this, or any other circum&s;tance, they &s;hould be di&s;&s;atisfied with his conduct, they have an undoubted right at any time to recal him, and nominate another in his place. This will tend to maintain a proper relation be|tween the repre&s;entative and the people, and a due dependence of the former upon the latter. Be&s;ides, when a man has lo&s;t the confidence of his fellow-citizens of the department, he is no longer their repre&s;entative; and when he cea&s;es to be theirs, he cannot in any &s;en&s;e be the repre&s;enta|tive of the nation; &s;ince it is not pretended that he can derive any authority, but through his own con&s;tituents. This, however, cannot deprive the
<PB N="189" REF="030026_0187_0FE4036B71E34550">
a&s;&s;embly of its right to expel or &s;u&s;pend a member for any refractory conduct, which may be deemed an offence again&s;t the &s;tate.</P>
<P><HI>Seventh,</HI> The article of <HI>inviolability,</HI> as applied to the members of the a&s;&s;embly, or to any other officers of the &s;tate, is worthy of re-con&s;ideration. But before it be again decided in the affirmative, you ought to take a general view of that intere&s;t|ing &s;ubject of <HI>impri&s;onment for debt.</HI> It is a &s;pecies of civil cruelty which all modern governments have borrowed from the Roman law, which con|&s;idered a debtor as a criminal, and committed the care of his puni&s;hment into the hands of the cre|ditor, lending the public pri&s;on as an in&s;trument of private vengeance. It is a di&s;grace to the wi&s;|dom of a nation, and can never be allowed in a well regulated &s;tate. If no citizen &s;hould be ar|re&s;ted or deprived of his liberty, for debt, there would be no need of making an exception in fa|vour of the officers of government; and thus you would remove a di&s;tinction which mu&s;t always appear unju&s;t.</P>
<P><HI>Eighth,</HI> You will &s;carcely think that your duty is di&s;charged, &s;o as to &s;atisfy your own minds on the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a con&s;titution, from which the friends of humanity will anticipate a total re|generation of &s;ociety, until you &s;hall have given a farther declaration on the &s;ubject of penal law. All men of reflection are agreed, that puni&s;hments in modern times have lo&s;t all proportion to the crimes to which they are annexed, even on that &s;cale of barbarous ju&s;tice by which they were in|troduced. Few, however, have had the wi&s;dom to di&s;cover, or the boldne&s;s to declare, the true cau&s;e of the evil; and while we remain ignorant of the cau&s;e, it is no wonder that we fail in find|ing
<PB N="190" REF="030026_0188_0FE402FA6A6BB5F0">
the remedy. In the glooms of meditation on the mi&s;eries of civilized life, I have been almo&s;t led to adopt this conclu&s;ion, That &s;ociety it&s;elf is the cau&s;e of all crimes; and, as &s;uch, it has no right to puni&s;h them at all. But, without indulg|ing the &s;everity of this unqualified a&s;&s;ertion, we may venture to &s;ay, that every puni&s;hment is a new crime; though it may not in all ca&s;es be &s;o great as would follow from omitting to puni&s;h.</P>
<P>There is a manife&s;t difference between <HI>puni&s;h|ment</HI> and <HI>correction</HI>; the latter, among rational be|ings, may always be performed by in&s;truction; or at mo&s;t by &s;ome gentle &s;pecies of re&s;traint. But puni&s;hment, on the part of the public, ari&s;es from no other &s;ource but a jealou&s;y of power. It is a confe&s;&s;ion of the inability of &s;ociety, to p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">|tect it&s;elf again&s;t an ignorant or refractory mem|ber. When there are factions in a &s;tate, contend|ing for the &s;upreme command, the pains inflicted by each party are &s;ummary; they often precede the crime; and the factions wreak their vengeance on each other, as a prevention of expected inju|ries. Something very &s;imilar to this is what per|petually takes place in every nation, in what is called a &s;tate of tranquility and order. For go|vernment has u&s;ually been nothing more than a regulated faction. The party which governs, and the party which reluctantly &s;ubmits to be governed, maintain a continual conflict; and out of that conflict proceed the crimes and the puni&s;hments, or, more properly &s;peaking, the puni&s;hments and the crimes. When we &s;ee the power of the na|tion &s;eizing an individual, dragging him to a tribunal, pronouncing him worthy of death, and then going through the &s;olemn formalities of exe|cution, it is natural to a&s;k, what is the meaning
<PB N="191" REF="030026_0189_0FE40371B863BEC8">
of all this? It certainly means, that the nation is in a &s;tate of civil war; and even in that barbarous &s;tage of war, when it is thought nece&s;&s;ary to put all pri&s;oners to death. In deciding the que&s;tion, whether a particular criminal &s;hould be put to death, I never would a&s;k what is the nature of his offence; it has nothing to do with the que&s;tion; I would &s;imply enquire, what is the condition of the &s;ociety. If it be in a &s;tate of internal peace, I would &s;ay it was wicked and ab&s;urd to think of inflicting &s;uch puni&s;hment. To plead that there is a nece&s;&s;ity for that de&s;perate remedy, proves a want of energy in the government, or of wi&s;dom in the nation.</P>
<P>When men are in a &s;tate of war, with the ene|my's bayonets pointed at their brea&s;ts, or when they are in the heat of a revolution, encompa&s;&s;ed by trea&s;on, and tormented by corruption, there is an apology for human &s;laughter; but when you have e&s;tabli&s;hed a wi&s;e and manly government, founded on the moral &s;en&s;e, and invigorated by the enlightened rea&s;on of the people, let it not be &s;ul|lied by that timid vengeance, which belongs only to tyrants and u&s;urpers. I could wi&s;h that your con&s;titution might declare, not merely what it has already declared, that the penal code &s;hall be re|formed, but, that within a certain period after the return of peace, <HI>the puni&s;hment of death &s;hall be aboli&s;hed.</HI> It ought likewi&s;e to enjoin it on the le|gi&s;lative body to &s;often the rigour of puni&s;hments in general, till they &s;hall amount to little more than a tender paternal correction. Whoever will look into the human heart, and examine the order of nature in &s;ociety, mu&s;t be convinced, that this is the mo&s;t likely method of preventing the com|mi&s;&s;ion of crimes. But,</P>
<P><PB N="192" REF="030026_0190_0FE402FF069A5E60"><HI>Ninth,</HI> In order to be con&s;i&s;tent with your&s;elves in removing tho&s;e abu&s;es which have laid the foun|dation of all offences again&s;t &s;ociety, both in crimes and puni&s;hments, you ought to pay a farther at|tention to the nece&s;&s;ity of <HI>public in&s;truction.</HI> It is your duty, as a con&s;tituent a&s;&s;embly to e&s;tabli&s;h a &s;y&s;tem of government that &s;hall improve the mo|rals of mankind. In rai&s;ing a people from &s;lavery to freedom, you have called them to act on a new theatre; and it is a nece&s;&s;ary part of your bu&s;ine&s;s, to teach them how to perform their parts. By di&s;|covering to a man his rights, you impo&s;e upon him a new &s;y&s;tem of duties. Every Frenchman, born to liberty, mu&s;t now claim, among the fir&s;t of his rights, the right of being in&s;tructed in the manner of pre&s;erving them. This the &s;ociety has no authority to refu&s;e; and to fail of enjoining it on the legi&s;lative body, as a part of its con&s;tant care, would be to counteract the principles of the revolution, and expo&s;e the whole &s;y&s;tem to be overturned.</P>
<P>From what the con&s;titution has already declared on this head, and from the di&s;po&s;ition of the two la&s;t a&s;&s;emblies, I have no doubt but con&s;iderable attention will be paid to it; but I wi&s;h in this place to recommend it to a more particular con&s;i|deration, as a &s;ubject connected with criminal law. It is certain that no obedience can be rati|onally expected from any man to a law which he does not know. It is not only unju&s;t, but ab&s;urd and even impo&s;&s;ible, to enforce his obedience. It is therefore but half the bu&s;ine&s;s of legi&s;lators to make good laws; an indi&s;pen&s;able part of their duty is to &s;ee that every per&s;on in the &s;tate &s;hall perfectly under&s;tand them. The barbarous max|im of juri&s;prudence, <HI>That ignorance of the law is
<PB N="193" REF="030026_0191_0FE4037735821AD8">
no excu&s;e to the offender,</HI> is an in&s;olent apology for tyranny, and ought never to di&s;grace the policy of a rational government. I think therefore it would do honour to your con&s;titution, and &s;erve as a &s;timulus to your legi&s;lature and to your magi&s;|trates, in the great duty of in&s;truction, to declare, <HI>That knowledge is the foundation of obedience, and that laws &s;hall have no authority but where they are under&s;tood.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Tenth,</HI> Since I am treating of morals, the great object of all political in&s;titutions, I cannot avoid be&s;towing &s;ome remarks on the &s;ubject of <HI>public lotteries.</HI> It is a &s;hocking di&s;grace to modern gov|ernments, that they are driven to this pitiful piece of knavery, to draw money from the people. But no circum&s;tance of this kind is &s;o extraordinary, as that this policy &s;hould be continued in France, &s;ince the revolution; and that a &s;tate lottery &s;hould &s;till be reckoned among the permanent &s;ources of revenue. It has its origin in deception; and de|pends for its &s;upport, on rai&s;ing and di&s;appointing the hopes of individuals, on perpetually agitating the mind with unrea&s;onable de&s;ires of gain, on clouding the under&s;tanding with &s;uper&s;titious ideas of chance, de&s;tiny, and fate, on diverting the at|tention from regular indu&s;try, and promoting a univer&s;al &s;pirit of gambling, which carries all &s;orts of vices into all cla&s;&s;es of people. Whatever way we look into human affairs, we &s;hall ever find, that the bad organization of &s;ociety is the cau&s;e of more di&s;orders than could po&s;&s;ibly ari&s;e from the natural temper of the heart. And what &s;hall we &s;ay of a government, that avowedly &s;teps forward with the in&s;olence of an open enemy, and creates a new vice for the &s;ake of loading it with a tax? What right has &s;uch a government to puni&s;h our follies?
<PB N="194" REF="030026_0192_0FE40304E7AA82B0">
And who can look without di&s;gu&s;t on the impious figure it makes, in holding the &s;courge in one hand, and the temptation in the other? You cannot he&s;itate to declare in your con&s;titution, that all &s;tate lotteries &s;hall be for ever aboli&s;hed.</P>
<P><HI>Eleventh,</HI> As yours is the fir&s;t nation in the world, that has &s;olemnly renounced the horrid bu|&s;ine&s;s of conque&s;t, you ought to proceed one &s;tep farther and declare, that you will have no more to do with <HI>colonies.</HI> This is but a nece&s;&s;ary con|&s;equence of your former renunciation. For colo|nies are an appendage of conque&s;t; and to claim a right to the one would be claiming a perpetual, or reiterated right to the other. Suppo&s;ing your colonies were to declare independence, and &s;et up a government of their own, (which your own principles and the fir&s;t laws of nature declare they have a right to do) in that ca&s;e, the &s;ame pretences which you now have to hold them under your con|trol, would certainly ju&s;tify you in reconquering and &s;ubjecting them. But it would be a mere wa&s;te of argument, to prove that you have no <HI>right</HI> to retain a &s;overeignty over them; and if I could bring my&s;elf to pay &s;o ill a compliment to your ju&s;tice, as to &s;uppo&s;e that you could wi&s;h to violate a right, for the &s;ake of what is called <HI>policy,</HI> it would be ea&s;y to &s;how, that to maintain foreign po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, is in all ca&s;es as impolitic, as it is un|ju&s;t and oppre&s;&s;ive. Policy, in this re&s;pect, can have no other object but the advantages of trade; and it may be laid down as a univer&s;al po&s;ition, that whatever &s;olid advantages can flow to the mo|ther-country from the trade of her colonies, would nece&s;&s;arily flow to her, if they were independent &s;tates. The experience of mankind has not yet enabled us even to &s;uppo&s;e a ca&s;e, in which it

would be otherwi&s;e. Whatever is free and mu|tually advantageous in trade, would be natural, and would be carried on by each party for its own intere&s;t: whatever is unnatural and forced, mu&s;t be &s;ecured by means that will probably le&s;&s;en the quantity of the whole; but at all events, the co&s;t of maintaining it will for ever exceed the profits. This is not only found to be true, from the expe|rience of every nation which has maintained colo|nies abroad; but the nature of the &s;ubject re|quires that it &s;hould always be the ca&s;e. It is a theory, for the proof of which no experience could have been nece&s;&s;ary; and it is to the pride of kings, and the mi&s;taken rapacity of governments, to the fal&s;e glare of extended &s;overeignty, and the de&s;ire of providing predatory places for the &s;ycophants of courts, that we are to attribute the train of calamities which has tormented the maritime na|tions of Europe, in maintaining colonies for the monopoly of trade. And where are we to look for rea&s;on and reformation, but to France? The Engli&s;h and other governments, to &s;upport a con|&s;i&s;tency of character, and fill up the mea&s;ure of their &s;ins, are faithful only to this one point, that the more they are convinced of the truth, the more ob&s;tinate is their per&s;everance in error.</P>
<P>I cannot but think it unnece&s;&s;ary, if not imper|tinent, to enter into farther arguments to prove, that ju&s;tice, policy, and the true principles of commerce, require you to &s;et the example to the world, of declaring your colonies ab&s;olutely free and independent &s;tates, and of inviting them to form a government of their own. The example would &s;oon be followed by other nations; if not from rea&s;on and from choice, at lea&s;t from the more imperious argument of nece&s;&s;ity.</P>
<P><PB N="196" REF="030026_0194_0FE4030845C72FE0"><HI>Twelfth,</HI> I cannot clo&s;e my letter, without &s;ome reflections on the policy of maintaining any thing like what is called <HI>a &s;tanding army in time of peace,</HI> which &s;eems to have been the intention of your fir&s;t a&s;&s;embly. Such a force would have many fatal effects on the &s;pirit of a republican government, without an&s;wering any good purpo&s;e that can be ex|pected from it. According to your own principles, you will have no more to do with foreign wars, unle&s;s you are invaded; and it is probable, that the pre&s;ent is the la&s;t inva&s;ion that will ever be formed again&s;t France. But, be that as it may, a &s;tanding military force is the wor&s;t re&s;ource that can be found for the defence of a free republic. In this ca&s;e, the &s;trength of the army is the weak|ne&s;s of the nation. If the army be really &s;trong enough to be relied on for defence, it not only impo&s;es upon the people a va&s;t unnece&s;&s;ary ex|pence, but it mu&s;t be a dangerous in&s;trument, in the hands of dangerous men; it may furni&s;h the means of civil wars, and of the de&s;truction of lib|erty. If, on the contrary, it be not &s;ufficient for external defence, it will only &s;erve to di&s;appoint the people. Being taught to believe that they have an army, they will cea&s;e to tru&s;t in their own &s;trength, and be deceived in their expectations of &s;afety.</P>
<P>But the greate&s;t objection again&s;t a &s;tanding ar|my is, the effect it would have on the political &s;entiments of the people. Every citizen ought to feel him&s;elf to be a nece&s;&s;ary part of the great community, for every purpo&s;e to which the public intere&s;t can call him to act; he &s;hould feel the habits of a citizen and the energies of a &s;oldier, without being exclu&s;ively de&s;tined to the functions of either. His phy&s;ical and moral powers &s;hould

be kept in equal vigour; as the di&s;u&s;e of the for|mer would be very &s;oon followed by the decay of the latter. If it be wrong to tru&s;t the legi&s;lative power of the &s;tate for a number of years, or for life, to a &s;mall number of men; it is certain<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y more prepo&s;terous to do the &s;ame thing with re|gard to military power. Where the wi&s;dom re|&s;ides, there ought the &s;trength to re&s;ide, in the great body of the people; and neither the one nor other ought ever to be delegated, but for &s;hort periods of time, and under &s;evere re&s;trictions. This is the way to pre&s;erve a temperate and man|ly u&s;e of both; and thus, by tru&s;ting only to them&s;elves, the people will be &s;ure of a perpetual defence again&s;t the open force, and the &s;ecret in|trigues of all po&s;&s;ible enemies at home and abroad.</P>
<P><HI>Thirteenth,</HI> After tracing the outlines of your con&s;titution, according to your pre&s;ent ideas, and proclaiming it in the mo&s;t &s;olemn manner, as the foundation of law and right, it will &s;till be vain to think of re&s;training the people from making al|terations and amendments, as often as experience &s;hall induce them to change their opinions. The point you have to aim at in this, is to agree upon a method in which amendments can be made, with|out any of tho&s;e extraordinary exertions, which would occa&s;ion unnece&s;&s;ary in&s;urrections. The more ea&s;y and expeditious this method &s;hall ap|pear, the le&s;s likely it will be to provoke di&s;orders, and the better it will an&s;wer the purpo&s;e, provided it always refers the &s;ubject to the real wi&s;hes of the people. I would propo&s;e, therefore, (on the pre&s;umption that your legi&s;lative body &s;hall be cho|&s;en only for one year at a time) that every annual national a&s;&s;embly &s;hall have power to <HI>pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">po&s;e,</HI> and the next &s;ucceeding one <HI>adopt</HI> and <HI>ratify,</HI> any
<PB N="198" REF="030026_0196_0FE4030E7A72AD50">
amendments that they &s;hall think proper in the con&s;titutional code. But it &s;hould always be done under this re&s;triction, <HI>that the articles to be propo&s;ed by any one a&s;&s;embly, &s;hould be agreed to, and publi&s;hed to the people in every department, within the fir&s;t &s;ix months of the &s;e&s;&s;ion of that a&s;&s;embly.</HI> This would give time to the people to di&s;cu&s;s the &s;ubject fully, and to form their opinions, previous to the time of electing their members to the next a&s;&s;embly. The members of the new a&s;&s;embly, when they &s;hould come together, would thus be competent to declare the wi&s;hes of the people on the amend|ments propo&s;ed, and would act upon them as they &s;hould think proper. The &s;ame power of <HI>propo&s;ing</HI> and then of <HI>adopting</HI> would be continued from year to year with perfect &s;afety to the con&s;titution, and with the probability of improvement.</P>
<P>Thus, gentlemen, I have given a ha&s;ty &s;ketch of &s;ome leading ideas, that lay with weight upon my mind, on a &s;ubject of much importance to the intere&s;ts of a con&s;iderable portion of the human race. If they &s;hould be thought of no value, they will of cour&s;e occupy but little of your attention, and therefore can do no injury. If I have &s;aid any thing from which a u&s;eful reflection &s;hall be drawn, I &s;hall feel my&s;elf happy in having render|ed &s;ome &s;ervice to the mo&s;t glorious cau&s;e that ever engaged the attention of mankind.</P>

<HEAD>A LETTER ADDRESSED TO THE PEOPLE OF PIEDMONT, On the advantages of the French Revolution, and the nece&s;&s;ity of adopting its principles in Italy.</HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="to the reader">
<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THIS Letter was written at Chambery in Savoy, in December 1792, at the reque&s;t of tho&s;e members of the National Convention, who were then in that country, for the purpo&s;e of organi&s;ing the department of Mont Blanc. It was printed in French at Grenoble, and in Italian at Nice, and &s;ent from tho&s;e places into Piedmont, and other parts of Italy, during that winter.</P>
<P>It will occur to the reader of the Engli&s;h copy, which now appears for the fir&s;t time in print, that the defection of Dumourier, in April 1793, the violent factions which di&s;tracted the Convention, and the &s;ub&s;equent civil commotions in many parts of France, occupied the attention of the republi|cans the remainder of that year. Their opera|tions again&s;t the league of foreign enemies (which was now augmented by the addition of England, Holland, Spain, and Naples) were confined for that campaign to the defence of the frontiers; and they were thus prevented from pu&s;hing the
<PB REF="030026_0198_0FE404DFADAE2338">
exten&s;ive advantages which they had gained the year before.</P>
<P>This circum&s;tance relieved the king of Sar|dinia from the de&s;pair in which he had been plunged. It gave him time to augment his for|ces and repair his fortifications. It gave him ar|guments again&s;t the French and the principles of the revolution, and thus enabled him in &s;ome de|gree to unite his people in favour of the &s;y&s;tem of de&s;poti&s;m to which they had be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> accu&s;tomed; for it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that the manner in which the French affairs were conducted that year, had a &s;trong tendency to excite a di&s;reli&s;h to their cau&s;e in the minds of di&s;tant of ignorant ob&s;ervers. In addition to all the&s;e advantages, he received a &s;ub&s;idy from England, to enable him to defend his own dominions; by the aid of which he has &s;ince obtained a large body of auxiliary troops from Tirol, Milan, and Tu&s;cany.</P>
<P>The&s;e unexpected events produced a remark|able change in the relative &s;ituation of the French and Piedmonte&s;e, from the clo&s;e of the fir&s;t cam|paign to the clo&s;e of the &s;econd. But the third is now opened with as much advantage to the French as the mo&s;t ardent republican could expect. The troops de&s;tined for the inva&s;ion of Italy this year, did not amount to more than one tenth of the military force that they now have in motion on the continent. Yet the&s;e have already pa&s;&s;ed the Alps in three different directions, and are at this time ma&s;ters of a con&s;iderable part of Pied|mont. It is probable that this campaign will e&s;tabli&s;h the revolution in that country, but un|happily with more expence of blood than was ex|pected from former appearances. Could the &s;ame force have been employed there the la&s;t year,
<PB REF="030026_0199_0FE404EC8BF0DE98">
under the circum&s;tances that then exi&s;ted, we may pre&s;ume it would have met but little oppo|&s;ition&punc; and the writer might have had the &s;ati&s;|faction of &s;eeing that his letter had produced &s;ome effect in promoting the cau&s;e of liberty and hap|pine&s;s in that intere&s;ting part of the world.</P>

<P>YOU occupy one of the &s;tronge&s;t frontiers of a country which nature &s;eems to have de&s;tined to be the happie&s;t in Europe. But a number of imperious circum&s;tances, of which you have been rather the victims than the authors, have for many centuries inverted the order of things, and depri|ved you of tho&s;e advantages which ought to attend your &s;ituation. I am a &s;tranger in this part of the world; Italy is known to me only from its hi&s;tory, and your pre&s;ent condition only from di&s;tant ob&s;er|vation and report. It is not probable that I &s;hall ever have the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing you or any part of your country. You mu&s;t, therefore, acquit me of entertaining any de&s;ire to mi&s;lead you, as I can have no po&s;&s;ible intere&s;t in addre&s;&s;ing you this letter, but the intere&s;t the human heart naturally takes in uttering the truth on a very important &s;ubject. You are my fellow-creatures; as &s;uch I love you, and cheri&s;h the ties which ought to be mutual be|tween us. You are in a condition which appears to me to call upon you to bur&s;t the bands of &s;lavery; in this view, I am ready to hail you as brothers, and wi&s;h to aid you in your work.</P>
<P>I pre&s;ume in the fir&s;t place, and I think I am not deceived, that you are di&s;contented with your
<PB N="203" REF="030026_0201_0FE404EE38ACC618">
pre&s;ent &s;ituation. I believe you are convinced that you cannot be happy, as a people, while the pow|ers of your government remain as they now are, as relative to the church, the &s;tate, and the army. If this be true, you mu&s;t wi&s;h for a change; pro|vided &s;uch change can be within your power, and provided you are convinced that it would be for your advantage. Let us examine the&s;e two points: whether you are able to effect a revolution in your government; and if you are, whether you would be benefited by it.&mdash;For it is not my wi&s;h to hurry you into mea&s;ures, of which you cannot &s;ee the i&s;&s;ue, and for wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ch you are not prepared.</P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>Are you able to effect a revolution in your go|vernment?</HI></P>
<P>The que&s;tion need never be a&s;ked of any people, when con&s;idered with reference to them&s;elves only, without regard to their neighbours. A whole peo|ple is e&s;&s;entially &s;overeign. They can at all times do as they plea&s;e with their own affairs, unle&s;s they are overpowered by &s;urrounding nations. It is the people who &s;upport the government as it now is; and the &s;ame &s;overeign people can at any time change its form, and &s;upport it in whatever man|ner it &s;hall plea&s;e them be&s;t. The que&s;tion has no difficulty in it, but when viewed with reference to the intere&s;t which other governments may have in preventing a revolution in their neighbourhood.</P>
<P>The enquiry, pur&s;ued in this connection, be|comes more exten&s;ive; e&s;pecially when applied to a country of &s;mall dimen&s;ions, and to a nation le&s;s powerful than &s;ome of its neighbours. Such is Piedmont. Had you been called upon &s;even years ago to look into your affairs, and take the government into your own hands, you mu&s;t have con&s;idered it as a dangerous experiment. Even
<PB N="204" REF="030026_0202_0FE404A137478128">
&s;uppo&s;ing the weight of your &s;ufferings to have been as great then as they are now, and &s;uppo&s;ing you had been po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the &s;ame information which you have &s;ince drawn from the progre&s;s of liberty in Europe, it would &s;carcely have been prudent for you to have engaged in &s;o daring an enterpri&s;e. All the tyrants in your neighbourhood would have brought forward their armies of &s;laves to cru&s;h the rebellion. The French court would have been, at that time, as much your enemy as the French nation is now your friend. And the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria, with all the &s;ubdivi&s;ions of its power in Italy, po&s;ted at your gates, would have united with that of Bourbon, to have guaranteed your king in every po&s;&s;ible extent of his oppre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Under the&s;e di&s;advantages your &s;truggles for li|berty might have been vain; they might even have produced a new injury, in&s;tead of reli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ving you from the old. But the ground is now changed; the duty you owe to your&s;elves is clearly pointed out by the natural current of events; and the work you have to do, in e&s;tabli&s;hing a perfect and undi&s;|turbed liberty, is in my opinion much ea&s;ier than you imagine. France is at this time, not only the mo&s;t powerful nation in Europe, but when engag|ed, as &s;he now is, in defence of liberty, &s;he is a match for all the other powers of Europe, when united in defence of tyranny. France is now your natural friend, the friend of all people and the enemy of all tyrants. She is indeed the only friend you have as a nation in this part of the world. Fr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nce has brought liberty to your doors; and &s;he invites you, in the name of all that is dear to you as men, in the name of all that can bind you to the intere&s;ts of human nature in general, to accept the ble&s;&s;ing at her hands. She has done more; &s;he
<PB N="205" REF="030026_0203_0FE404F0748B89C0">
has taught you and all other people how public happine&s;s is to be acquired and pre&s;erved. She has addre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf to the great principles of rea|&s;on which are common to all men; &s;he has cleared away the ma&s;s of prejudice, of fal&s;e doctrine, of &s;uper&s;tition in the &s;cience of morals; a ma&s;s which the complicated abu&s;es of tyranny, continued for many centuries, had accumulated on the human mind. She has laid down and clearly defined the rights and duties of man and of citizens, explain|ed the great doctrine of equality, the true de&s;ign of government, the nature of the tru&s;t to be repo&s;|ed in public officers, as &s;ervants of the people, by whom they are created and by whom they are paid. She has taught you a great practical truth, which is too con&s;oling to be rejected, and too clear to be called in que&s;tion, <HI>that you are the &s;overeigns in your own country</HI>; that you have not, that you cannot have a ma&s;ter, unle&s;s you choo&s;e to give up your rea&s;on, and renounce the character of men; that for any man to call him&s;elf your &s;ove|reign is a bla&s;phemy again&s;t God the &s;overeign of nature, and again&s;t men the proprietors of the earth.</P>
<P>Obligations of gratitude are due to the French nation from you, and from every people in Eu|rope. She has conquered liberty for all men, and laid the foundation for univer&s;al public felicity. Other nations have only to build the &s;uper&s;truct|ure, of which the model is given them in the con|&s;titution of this great republic.</P>
<P>But let us not amu&s;e our&s;elves wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h words, nor re&s;t the argument on theoretical principles, howev|er inconte&s;tible they may be.

to a clo&s;e. You have &s;een <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> principal ty|rants and the mo&s;t formidable armies of Europe, combined and marching in the full career of pro|mi&s;ed victory again&s;t the liberties of France.&mdash; The&s;e armies after &s;weeping over half of Europe and fami&s;hing whole countries in their way to the French frontiers, have there been cut to pieces by a handful of freemen, and driven out of their c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">untry. Liberty has marched on the heels of the fugitives; the arch tyrant of Au&s;tria, at the head of this fatal con&s;piracy of kings, has lo&s;t the fine&s;t part of his dominions; many of the &s;ubal|tern princes of the empire have lo&s;t the whole of theirs, and are now beggars abroad among their brother brigands, who are in expectation of the &s;ame inevitable fate. The &s;tandard of liberty has reached the borders of the Rhine by the mi&s;car|riage of the &s;ame combination which has brought it to the &s;ummit of the Alps.</P>
<P>All the crowned heads in Europe are now cov|ered with thorns. The man of Turin, who calls him&s;elf your king, has been forced to relinqui&s;h one half of the u&s;urpations of his ance&s;tors, and is now menacing you with de&s;truction for fear you &s;hould reclaim the re&s;t. The Dutchy of Sa|voy and the county of Nice, more fortunate than you, have been the fir&s;t to ca&s;t off his yoke, and are now ready to a&s;&s;i&s;t you with their arms to fol|low their example. The pope and the other Ital|ian de&s;pots, are occupied in re&s;training the &s;pirit of liberty at home; &s;o that no one of the neigh|bouring powers is in a condition to take any con|&s;iderable part in your affairs, except the French; and the French are wi&s;hing to give you every aid that you may a&s;k.</P>
<P><PB N="207" REF="030026_0205_0FE404F61FC73160">Under the&s;e circum&s;tances, we need no longer enquire whether you are able to effect a revolu|tion; the more natural que&s;tion is, are you able to re&s;i&s;t it? It is true, the French have renounced all ideas of conque&s;t, and have declared that they will never make war again&s;t the liberty of any people. But you will ob&s;erve that this principle contains in it&s;elf a declaration of war again&s;t all tyrants who are ho&s;tile to the liberty of France; e&s;pecially again&s;t tho&s;e who&s;e vicinity renders them dangerous to the internal peace of the new repub|lic, by fo&s;tering its fugitive&punc; traitors, and being the centre of new con&s;piracies again&s;t the rights of man. The court of Turin comes under this de&s;cription. It is ho&s;tile to the liberties of France; it has been &s;o from the beginning; the nature of its external connections and of its internal con&s;ti|tution requires that it &s;hould be &s;o to the end. The court of Turin mu&s;t, therefore, be over|turned; the government of your country mu&s;t be changed, and its powers re&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ed to you, to whom they naturally belong.</P>

&s;carcely be rendered wor&s;e, and the means of ren|dering it better are &s;o obvious that they cannot e&s;cape the &s;lighte&s;t ob&s;ervation. But tho&s;e of you who are accu&s;tomed to reflect on the principles of liberty will pardon the &s;implicity of the enquiry, in favour of the great ma&s;s of the people whom it is our duty to in&s;truct. There has been &s;o much fal&s;ehood and folly impo&s;ed on that cla&s;s of man|kind, in order to deba&s;e and brutalize their minds to the level of their condition, that their ignorance has become preter natural; it is almo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary to begin their in&s;truction by informing them that they are human creatures.

<P>This is preci&s;ely what the people of France have done; and the performance of this great work, &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to the happine&s;s of mankind, is called the French revolution. It is the know|ledge of this revolution which your court and clergy wi&s;h to conceal from you, le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t you &s;hould follow the example. They prevent the French new&s;papers from coming into your country; they forbid the reading of all book that treat of this revolution, and all conver&s;ation on that or any other political &s;ubject; they have &s;hut up the po|pular theatres at Turin, and left open none but that of the nobility, from which the citizens are

<P>All this is to keep you ignorant of the French revolution, that you may not be di&s;po&s;ed to follow the example. Ob&s;erve the in&s;ult offered to your under&s;tanding. If the example were bad, your good &s;en&s;e would teach you to &s;hun it; it would need only to be known, to be de&s;pi&s;ed; and it ought to be explained to all people, that they might learn to avoid &s;uch a dangerous innovation. If it be good, it ought to be taught by your teach|ers, and imitated by all the world. But be a&s;&s;ured that the very caution they u&s;e to prevent your com|ing to the knowledge of the fact, is a proof that &s;uch a revolution would be an advantage to you and a di&s;advantage to them.</P>
<P>But this is not all; they have invented a thou|&s;and fal&s;ehoods to &s;upply the place of truth. They have told you lies, in order to exci&s;e your enmity again&s;t your be&s;t friends, and to rou&s;e you to war again&s;t tho&s;e principles which ought to be as dear to you as to the French; becau&s;e they are the principles of equal liberty and national happine&s;s, applicable to all people. They have told you that the French nation is a race of robbers, a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins, and athei&s;ts; that they have overturned the religion of their country, waged war again&s;t all property and again&s;t the lives of its owners. The&s;e are impudent fal&s;ehoods which never could have been impo&s;ed upon you for a moment, had you been permitted to judge for your&s;elves.</P>
<P><PB N="211" REF="030026_0209_0FE404FA35DEBDB0">With regard to religion, I only reque&s;t you to look into the fir&s;t principles of liberty, as declared by the national a&s;&s;embly. You will find them conformable to the &s;y&s;tem of the catholic faith, as taught by the apo&s;tles and recognized in your country, before the church was connected with the civil government, and before the mini&s;ters of the altar became the tyrants of the &s;tate. The French con&s;titution has declared, that all men &s;hall be free to wor&s;hip God in their own way, and to follow the dictates of their con&s;cience. If any man &s;hall tell you that this is de&s;troying your religion, he is a liar, and not worthy to be your teacher. The go&s;pel of Je&s;us Chri&s;t preaches to you in the &s;tronge&s;t language the great doctrine of equality, that all men are equal in the &s;ight of God, and that you &s;hall call no man your ma&s;ter upon earth.&mdash; This is the very language of the French revolu|tion. But its authors have gone farther; and, to &s;ilence all cavillers who could per&s;uade you or others that they have de&s;troyed the catholic relig|ion, they have done more to maintain it than any legi&s;lative body ever did before; they have ordain|ed that the prie&s;ts and bi&s;hops, cho&s;en by the peo|ple, &s;hall be &s;alaried and paid out of the national pur&s;e.</P>

This is an advantage to religion, in&s;tead of being again&s;t it; for relig|ion teaches men to do good, and to labour for their living; but the&s;e in&s;titutions teach them to do nothing, and live upon the labours of others. Be a&s;&s;ured, therefore, that the French have done nothing to the di&s;advantage of religion; but, on the contrary, they have done much to maintain it

in its native purity and independence. But I in|treat you in the &s;incerity of my heart not to re|ceive this fact on the &s;trength of my a&s;&s;ertion, or that of any other man; but to look into their con|duct and judge for your&s;elves.</P>
<P>You have been likewi&s;e taught to believe that the French have violated private property. This is a malicious calumny, which every &s;tep of their revolution will contradict, the moment you be|come acquainted with it. In all the decrees of the national a&s;&s;embly, in all the irregular move|ments and in&s;urrections of the people, whatever was the object, you will find they have paid a mo&s;t &s;acred regard to individual property. Their con|duct in this re&s;pect has been more laudable within the la&s;t three years than that of any other govern|ment in Europe. The &s;ame thing may be ob|&s;erved with regard to the private morals of the peo|ple; they are e&s;&s;entially better than they formerly were. There have been le&s;s in&s;tances of theft and robbery in France &s;ince the revolution, than at any former period; and probably le&s;s, in propor|tion to its population, than in any of the neigh|bouring countries during the &s;ame period.</P>
<P>With regard to the national a&s;&s;embly, I will give you &s;ome in&s;tances of their inviolable princi|ple of pre&s;erving the property of individuals amid&s;t the &s;hock of the revolution. The abu&s;es of the ancient government had created thou&s;ands of u&s;ele&s;s offices in every department of &s;tate, in the <HI>law,</HI> the <HI>finance,</HI> and the <HI>king's hou&s;ehold,</HI>&mdash;the &s;ame as you &s;ee at Turin. The&s;e offices were &s;uppo&s;ed to have been purcha&s;ed and paid for by tho&s;e who held them; though many of them had been given gratis through favour and intrigue. On the regeneration of the government and of the
<PB N="213" REF="030026_0211_0FE404FBE8C74CF0">
nation by the revolution, it was nece&s;&s;ary that the&s;e de&s;tructive &s;inecures &s;hould be &s;uppre&s;&s;ed; and the a&s;&s;embly, con&s;idering them as the proper|ty of the holders, purcha&s;ed up this property and paid the proprietors the full prices they had given or were &s;uppo&s;ed to have given for their places. This act of ju&s;tice was certainly not nece&s;&s;ary to the re|volution. It mu&s;t therefore be con&s;idered as a mark of that national dignity which forbids the violation of any kind of private property, howev|er &s;lender the title by which it is claimed.</P>
<P>Another in&s;tance may be ob&s;erved in the public debt. It is well known that the public debt of France, as well as that of Piedmont, was con|tracted by a wicked and infamous court, the great|er part of it for the wor&s;t of purpo&s;es. It was in part contracted to &s;upport the vices of a horde of men and women at Ver&s;ailles, who were a di&s;|grace to human nature, and whom the nation was under no obligation&punc; to maintain; it was in part contracted to carry on foreign wars and con|que&s;ts, the expre&s;s purpo&s;e of which was to rivet the chains of the people at home. But as the creditors in general were not to be blamed for the&s;e things, they were declared to be the propri|etors of the debt; and the nation a&s;&s;umed upon it|&s;elf the payment, without any dimunition. This mu&s;t ever be remembered as an act of &s;overeign magnanimity and of di&s;intere&s;ted protection to the property of individuals; an act to which they were not con&s;trained by any nece&s;&s;ity or previous obligation. A royal bankruptcy might have been declared, without affecting the future credit of the nation; and the revolution would have &s;uffered no delay, but would have been facilitated by proceed|ing on this principle. In&s;tead of doing this, the
<PB N="214" REF="030026_0212_0FE404B2CFA67070">
people have voluntarily taken an immen&s;e burden on them&s;elves, even under the humiliating cir|cum&s;tance of giving a &s;anction to all the extrava|gance of the two la&s;t centuries, and paying at this day, under the rigid economy of a republic, for tho&s;e &s;plendid palaces, gardens, and water-works, which in&s;ult the poverty of millions, and &s;tare the nation in the face with the unpuni&s;hed crimes of a race of execrated kings.</P>
<P>The act of the a&s;&s;embly declaring the church lands to be the property of the nation, the &s;up|pre&s;&s;ion of tithes and other feudal claims, have been often mentioned as violations of property. Tho&s;e who really con&s;ider them in this light are weak men, or they have not examined the &s;ub|ject; tho&s;e who per&s;uade you to think &s;o, without believing it them&s;elves, are wicked men, and not to be tru&s;ted. As to the church lands, this act of the a&s;&s;embly did not change the property of them at all. They belonged to the nation before.&mdash; What the a&s;&s;embly did, was to change the mode of paying the clergy, equalize their &s;alaries, and reduce the number of eccle&s;ia&s;tics. That labori|ous and more u&s;eful cla&s;s of the clergy, who be|fore were &s;tarving upon a beggarly pittance, have had their &s;alaries rai&s;ed; that idle and overgrown cla&s;s, who, without doing any duty, were living in the &s;tyle of princes and tyrants, have been re|duced to a moderate income. All are now cho&s;en by the people, and all paid by the nation. With regard to the feudal claims, they were founded in u&s;urpation. The landlords and nobles, to whom they were attributed, had no right to them or pro|perty in them, any more than the king of Sardin|ia has property in you, or in the people of Jeru&s;a|lem, of which he likewi&s;e &s;tyles him&s;elf king. The&s;e
<PB N="215" REF="030026_0213_0FE4050272B22640">
feudal claims were mere badges of &s;ervitude, which the e&s;tabli&s;hment of equal liberty and the abolition of hereditary titles rendered it nece&s;&s;ary to de&s;troy. The nation has in all in&s;tances &s;howed it&s;elf able to di&s;tingui&s;h between the empty &s;uper&s;tition of pomp, which &s;erves only to deba&s;e mankind, and the &s;olid principles of &s;ociety on which the revolu|tion is founded.</P>
<P>You have heard it likewi&s;e a&s;&s;erted that the French revolution has been marked with cruelty and murder. This is unfortunately true. But it has likewi&s;e been marked with treachery, with bribery, with perjury, with all the complicated wiles of expiring de&s;poti&s;m. All the cruelty, all the crimes of every name or denomination, that have attended this revolution, have proceeded from royalty, the adherents of royalty, and the refractory prie&s;ts. The court of Ver&s;ailles had been for ages a &s;chool of fal&s;ehood and deceit; and the execution of the penal laws &s;erved as a public exhibition of torture, to familiarize the people with the mo&s;t &s;anguinary puni&s;hments. If the court of Turin and the laws of Piedmont are any better, it is happier for you; you will have the le&s;s wickedne&s;s to combat in the cour&s;e of your revolution. But I fear in &s;ome re&s;pects they are wor&s;e. The&s;e circum&s;tances in France had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rained up in all parts of the kingdom a numerous cla&s;s of men ver&s;ed in every art of treachery and perfidy.

But the&s;e deceitful men, being enemies of the revolution,

<P>The limits, I pre&s;cribe to my letter, will not allow of my entering into details on a &s;ubject &s;o intricate and exten&s;ive. This, however, may be relied on as an undeniable truth, that no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hing is more humane, generous and ju&s;t, than the general &s;pirit of the revolution; and whatever particular acts may &s;eem to contravene the&s;e principles, tho&s;e acts are chargeable upon its enemies, and not upon its friends.</P>

the cour&s;e of the revolution in a geographical &s;en&s;e, and pa&s;s with it from France to Piedmont. The revolution in this journey has &s;topped to win|ter in Savoy, from whence I write this letter; and before we mount the Alps, it is natural to make a pau&s;e, to contemplate the country where we are. Here is a people who lately made part of your&s;elves, and who are now &s;eparated from you, rather on account of their vicinity to France, than for any particular intere&s;t different from your own. For, in the great cau&s;e of liberty, the in|tere&s;ts of all people are the &s;ame. It is the cau&s;e of tyranny that has made them enemies; it is the impo&s;ition and fal&s;ehood of tho&s;e who would live on other men's labours, that have occa&s;ioned all the wars of every nation in the world. The peo|ple of Savoy were certainly under no obligation to be governed by the king of Jeru&s;alem; though they had groaned under his yoke for many gener|ations. Their late conduct in declaring their own &s;overeignty and independence, aboli&s;hing heredi|tary titles, and e&s;tabli&s;hing a government of their own on the principles of equal liberty, is a &s;ub|ject which mu&s;t &s;trike your minds in a very inter|e&s;ting point of view. Your tyrants will repre&s;ent it as a crime which ought to excite your indigna|tion; and they will call on you to take up arms and ru&s;h headlong into a de&s;tructive war, to a&s;&s;i&s;t them in reducing this country again to their obedi|ence. They are now preparing their forces, augmenting their armies, borrowing money abroad and extorting it from the hand of indu&s;try at home, for this dete&s;table purpo&s;e. You are to be taken from your farms and your &s;hops, and enrolled in the regiments of death. If you are unwilling to engage in this new kind of &s;lavery, you are to be
<PB N="218" REF="030026_0216_0FE404BC0ACC57E0">
&s;eized upon like &s;o many felons, dragged from your wives and children, and tortured into di&s;ci|pline under the la&s;h of a military officer. Your families are to be left to peri&s;h in poverty, while you perhaps are &s;laughtered in the field.</P>
<P>But before you &s;uffer your&s;elves to be driven to this de&s;perate bu&s;ine&s;s, I intreat you to re&s;ort to your own rea&s;on, and exerci&s;e the right of judg|ing for your&s;elves. Con&s;ider the nature of the enterpri&s;e, and the object you have in view.&mdash; Who are the people on whom you are going to let fall this terrible &s;troke of vengeance? What is their cri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e? Are they not your brothers and friends? Have they not acted as you would have done in the &s;ame &s;ituation? And ought you not rather at this moment to follow their example, than to be the in&s;truments of their de&s;truction and your own? Let us attend to this enquiry before it be too late.</P>
<P>The people of Savoy, as to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> po&s;ition &s;tand in the &s;ame relation to France as you &s;tand in to Italy.

You cannot avoid being in&s;ulted by foreign armies in their pa&s;&s;age through your country, although you have no intere&s;t in their quarrels. Your hi&s;tory is full of examples of this kind, from the days of Han|nibal, down to that infamous war of the Spani&s;h &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, which involved your country in blood and held half Europe in arms for many years to|gether; a war in which you had no other concern, than that of being the victims of foreign di&s;putes.
<PB N="219" REF="030026_0217_0FE4050667F86818">
The face of your country bears the in&s;ulting marks of this unfortunate po&s;ition in which you are pla|ced. It is covered with fortifications. As if na|ture had not thrown rocks and mountains enough in your way, you have been forced to create them by the hand of art, to encompa&s;s your towns with walls, and disfigure your fields with towers and ca&s;tles. Your agriculture has been ill-conducted, your manufactures neglected; all the u&s;eful arts have been forced to yield to a general &s;y&s;tem of defence again&s;t the enemies of your neighbours, when you had no enemies of your own.</P>
<P>In this &s;ituation, what is to be done? You cannot change the po&s;ition which nature has given to your country. Your only re&s;ource is to change the policy of Europe from war to peace. You are more peculiarly intere&s;ted in the perpetual peace of Europe than any other people on earth. This is a weighty con&s;ideration, a truth which your tyrants cannot deny. It is the knowledge of this truth which has influenced the people of Sa|voy in their late change of government. It is in this point of view that they have contemplated the French revolution; with this they have adopted it them&s;elves, and wi&s;h to extend it to you, who&s;e &s;ituation &s;o nearly re&s;embles their own. With this view you ought to wi&s;h to extend it to all the &s;tates of Italy, to Spain, and to the circles of the empire, from whence it would travel through Europe and through the world.</P>
<P>The principles of this revolution are tho&s;e of univer&s;al peace; and it is impo&s;&s;ible that it &s;hould fail to produce the effect, becau&s;e it takes away every motive for national ho&s;tility, and teaches the people of all countries to regard each other as friends and fellow-citizens of the world.

Purge the earth of its tyrants, and it will no more be tormented with war.</P>
<P>The conduct of the people of Savoy in uniting them&s;elves to the French republic de&s;erves a far|ther con&s;ideration. This was a mea&s;ure inciden|tal to their geographical po&s;ition on the French &s;ide of the Alps; and the arguments which indu|ced them to it, do not apply to you.

But this &s;tep of theirs cannot be con&s;idered by you as an act of ho&s;tility, or a breach of friend&s;hip. They are certainly not le&s;s your friends &s;ince they have cea&s;|ed to be your fellow-&s;ubjects. It is an e&s;&s;ential quality of a French citizen to be the friend of all people, e&s;pecially of tho&s;e in his neighbourhood, who&s;e peace and happine&s;s will always be nece&s;&s;a|ry to his own.</P>
<P>The e&s;&s;ence of tyranny is to counteract the economy of nature, the e&s;&s;ence of liberty is to promote it.

The Savoyards have been treated as your &s;laves, as well as the &s;laves of your com|mon ma&s;ter. Their hard earnings have been drained from them, to increa&s;e the wealth and population of Piedmont. You mu&s;t ob&s;erve, however, that this was not de&s;igned as an advan|tage to you, neither has it been &s;o in fact. It was done to facilitate the collection of the king's revenue.

&s;en&s;ible that he &s;upported a &s;et of infamous court|iers beyond the mountains, who riot on the la|bours of mankind.</P>
<P>The effect of tyranny has u&s;ually been to vitiate the morals of &s;ociety, and de&s;troy that energy of mind which is natural to man in a &s;tate of free|dom. The people of Savoy exhibit a remarkable exception to this rule. They retain a &s;ingular pu|rity of morals, and a firmne&s;s of character, which the weight of a long and complicated tyranny has not been able to deba&s;e. They have long witne&s;&s;|ed the vices and indured the inju&s;tice of their ma&s;|ters, without learning to be vicious or unju&s;t.&mdash; They have felt the inconvenience of that unnatural combination of things which cut them off from the country to which they really belonged, and bound them to a di&s;tant lord. But almighty liberty has at la&s;t di&s;&s;olved the chain, and re&s;tored them to na|ture and to France.</P>
<P>The moral character of this people, which renders them &s;o worthy of our e&s;teem, has like|wi&s;e fitted them for the enjoyment of the liberty to which they have been &s;o &s;uddenly born. No people, ri&s;ing at once from &s;lavery to a &s;tate of equality and independence, ever conducted them|&s;elves with &s;o much dignity and moderation.&mdash; They ro&s;e, like the infant Hercules, to the vigour of manhood in a &s;ingle day. They &s;howed them|&s;elves ma&s;ters of the whole &s;y&s;tem of government, the moment they became ma&s;ters of them&s;elves. They have committed no blunders; they have ta|ken no retrograde &s;teps; they have lo&s;t no time in idle di&s;putes, and u&s;ele&s;s etiquette. Their National Convention, which was the fir&s;t repre|&s;entative body that ever was heard of in the coun|try, and con&s;i&s;ted of &s;ix hunderd and fifty mem|bers,

But there is one fact more remarkable than all the re&s;t, a fact which hi&s;tory will announce to the ad|miration of the late&s;t ages: the revolution in Savoy has not yet co&s;t a &s;ingle drop of blood. It has been attended with no acts of violence, no tumult|uous meetings, no nece&s;&s;ity for the intervention of military force. The force of rea&s;on has conduct|ed the whole operation; and the &s;acred energy of liberty has proved it&s;elf to be the &s;ource and gua|rantee of the moral attributes of man.</P>
<P>Such is the condition of this re&s;pectable people; and &s;uch is the point of view in which you are to con&s;ider the late mea&s;ures they have taken to re|claim and &s;ecure their rights. From this con&s;ider|ation you will naturally turn your attention to your&s;elves, and contemplate the duties you are called upon to perform. For the time is fa&s;t ap|proaching when you can no longer be the idle &s;pectators of the triumphs of liberty. Although the revolution in Savoy is hitherto free from the violence of war, it depends on you to &s;ay whether it &s;hall continue &s;o to the end of another year. It is in your power at this moment to declare that the Alps &s;hall never more re-echo the &s;ound of a can|non, nor their maje&s;tic &s;treams be &s;tained with human blood. Your de&s;tiny calls you either to pronounce the &s;entence of mi&s;ery and &s;laughter upon thou&s;ands of your&s;elves and of your neigh|bours who will follow your example, or to declare the immediate emancipation, peace and happine&s;s of all the &s;tates of Italy.</P>
<P><PB N="226" REF="030026_0224_0FE404C8C2AFED60">This is doubtle&s;s a &s;erious commi&s;&s;ion, as it renders you re&s;pon&s;ible for the fate of &s;o con&s;ider|able a portion of your fellow-creatures.

<P>Your king has joined the coalition of de&s;pots again&s;t the people of all nations. Their arms are directed again&s;t France; but their ho&s;tility is really again&s;t their own &s;ubjects. What cau&s;e of quarrel had the king of Hungary, or the elector of Bran|denburgh with the people of France? None. Their jealou&s;y was again&s;t the people of Hungary, of Au&s;tria, of Brabant, and of Brandenburgh. They &s;aw that the&s;e nations were about to reclaim

the rights of man and to ca&s;t off the yoke of op|pre&s;&s;ion, as the French had done. They, there|fore, to retain their unju&s;t power at home, con|cluded that it was be&s;t&punc; to &s;trike the revelution at i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s root, and conquer Germany in France. They knew, if they could &s;ubdue the French, and com|pletely vanqui&s;h the &s;pirit of liberty in that coun|try, that all the pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ple of Europe would &s;hrink beneath their chains, and their ma&s;ters might pro|bably &s;leep upon their thrones for another half century.</P>
<P>Such was the policy of your ma&s;ter. You can|not &s;uppo&s;e that, as king of Jeru&s;alem or prince of Piedmont, he had any ground or colour of di&s;|pute with the French nation. That nation had no concern with him, nor with any part of his dominions. They were occupied in their own affairs, at peace with all the world, and declared that they meant to remain &s;o. He entered into the war with them for no other purpo&s;e but to keep you in &s;ubjection. The war was again&s;t you, and is &s;till to be carried on again&s;t you the next cam|paign. He intends to make you his &s;oldiers to fight his own battles again&s;t your&s;elves, although he orders you to point your cannon again&s;t the French.</P>
<P>This is the true &s;tate of the ca&s;e. The whole of this war on the part of your monarch is main|tained by deceiving you. Indeed the whole bu&s;ine&s;s of monarchy is deception; kings mu&s;t govern by deception, as long as they govern at all; for it is impo&s;&s;ible for one man to tyrannize over a whole people, but by deceiving them. I have no par|ticular di&s;like to your king, any more than to all others; he is probably no wor&s;e than kings in ge|neral. They hold an office that is perfectly u&s;ele&s;s in &s;ociety, and exceedingly de&s;tructive to the peace
<PB N="228" REF="030026_0226_0FE404CA81F12D58">
and happine&s;s of mankind. In this view they ought to be dete&s;ted by every man, and rejected by every nation.</P>
<P>France has been forced into the field, to encoun|ter this infamous combination of robbers, this war of all crimes again&s;t the principles of all virtue. She has undertaken the defence of human nature. She has a&s;&s;umed a new kind of tactique unknown to the art of war, and irre&s;i&s;tible to the armies of kings. She has armed her&s;elf in the panoply of rea&s;on; her manife&s;to is the rights of man, her &s;word the pledge of peace. In this &s;pecies of warfare we need not be a&s;toni&s;hed at her &s;ucce&s;s. What people can re&s;i&s;t the hand that comes to break their chains? The armies of liberty are every where triumphant, while their &s;tandards are &s;carcely &s;tained with blood. Victory completes her work, before they arrive to celebrate the conque&s;t; and the entrance of the French troops into the con|quered country is regarded by the people rather as the proce&s;&s;ion of a civic fea&s;t, than as the dreaded violence of war. Their general, in&s;tead of puni&s;h|ing the new recovered citizens with confi&s;cation, impri&s;onment, and death, meets them in their po|pular &s;ocieties, and invites them to form their pri|mary a&s;&s;emblies. The forts and garri&s;ons which he erects to &s;ecure his conque&s;ts, are printing pre&s;&s;es and reading clubs.</P>
<P>Such is the war in which the illu&s;trious monarch of Turin is engaged. The&s;e are the armies he expects you to encounter in the field. If you wi&s;h to know in what manner the combat ought to be conducted, you may learn it from the people of Savoy, who&s;e example in this re&s;pect, as in many others, is worthy to be followed by every nation. You may learn it likewi&s;e from the people of
<PB N="229" REF="030026_0227_0FE4051572665BE8">
Nice, from tho&s;e of Hainault, Flanders, Brabant, Malines, Antwerp, Guelderland, Namur, Liege, Spires, and Mayence; all provinces, principalities, or independent &s;tates, conquered to liberty within the la&s;t three months. As I have kept no com|plete regi&s;ter of the&s;e conque&s;ts, perhaps the above li&s;t may be incomplete. But it matters not; if it were complete for to-day, perhaps it would not be &s;o for to-morrow. This advice is intended for the in&s;truction of the people; if your king &s;hould deem it incon&s;i&s;tent with his warlike character to follow the &s;ame advice, he can take a le&s;&s;on from the battle of Gemmappe.</P>
<P>The French army de&s;tined for your deliverance will probably not pa&s;s the Alps till the &s;pring. You have the remainder of the winter to deliber|ate on the part you have to act. You can by that time decide whether you will receive them as ene|mies or as friends. In the latter ca&s;e, you have on|ly to &s;tudy the principles of a republican govern|ment, &s;end away your tyrants, and prepare your|&s;elves to give le&s;&s;ons of liberty to all the Italian &s;tates. The troops of Au&s;tria, which are now about to enter your territories from Milan and Tu&s;cany, under pretence of aiding you again&s;t the French, will flee before them, as they have done in the Low Countries, the moment you manife&s;t your intention of doing your own bu&s;i|ne&s;s in a peaceable way.</P>
<P>But, after a due con&s;ideration of the circum|&s;tances which I have endeavoured to detail, &s;hould you conclude to regard the French people as your enemies, and to meet their armies in the field, I &s;hall tremble for the con&s;equences of your unfor|tunate deci&s;ion. Thou&s;ands among you mu&s;t fall the victims of the infamous cau&s;e of your ty|rant,
<PB N="230" REF="030026_0228_0FE404CCBADB90E0">
which cannot be &s;upported. On that day, I beg you would call to mind the hone&s;t advice of a &s;tranger, who now &s;peaks to you the words of truth; who has been a &s;teady ob&s;erver of the ri&s;e and progre&s;s of liberty in America and in France; and, who, from the&s;e advantages is able to e&s;ti|mate the force of its principles, and predict the triumph of its arms.</P>
<P>I advi&s;e you above all things to be cautious of the troops in the pay of Au&s;tria, who are march|ing to join your army. You cannot be &s;o blind|ed by your leaders as to &s;uppo&s;e that this band of ruffians is brought into your country to render &s;er|vice to you. They are de&s;igned to keep you in &s;ubjection, and to take from you the freedom of your choice in the great que&s;tion, Whether you will adopt the principles of the French revolu|tion? They will be po&s;ted in your rear, to act again&s;t you, if you &s;hould refu&s;e to act again&s;t the French. Your po&s;ition may &s;eem a critical one, placed in the interval between two contending powers; but, remember that one is an army of freemen, the other a horde of &s;laves; on one &s;ide is the permanent force of a nation, who&s;e means are inexhau&s;tible, on the other the accidental hire|lings of a de&s;pot who&s;e &s;ceptre is falling from his hands; from one you have the offer of equal lib|erty and perpetual peace, from the other a conti|nuance of your &s;lavery, an augmentation of your burthens, and certainty of future wars.</P>
<P>Italy is de&s;tined to form one great republic. The boundaries which nature has given it are pe|culiarly &s;uited to this purpo&s;e; and as long as we follow nature, in politics as well as morals, we are &s;ure to be in the right. Politicians, who have not well con&s;idered the effects of liberty, are alarm|ed

at the exten&s;ion of the French republic, fear|ing it will become too powerful for its neighbours. For this rea&s;on the union of Savoy is mentioned as a &s;ubject of jealou&s;y to other nations. The ene|mies of your liberty will not fail to make u&s;e of this to excite your fears and provoke your re&s;ent|ment. Men who rea&s;on in this manner have formed their maxims on tho&s;e de&s;potic &s;y&s;tems of government to which they have been accu&s;tomed. They are maxims which can no longer apply to nations, when ma&s;ters of their own actions, and at liberty to govern them&s;elves by the collected wi&s;dom of the great body of the people. A nation in this condition will never di&s;turb the peace of its neighbours in any manner whatever. Its inter|e&s;t, on the contrary; will be to promote the peace and pro&s;perity of every country in the world.</P>
<P>When a nation is governed by one man, like Piedmont, or by a few families, like the ancient ari&s;tocracy of Rome, and &s;everal modern ones in Italy, the intere&s;t of tho&s;e who govern, is to ex|tend their dominions; becau&s;e it augments their per&s;onal revenue and adds to the weight of their influence over the people, whom they con&s;ider as their property.&mdash;For this rea&s;on they make war; for this rea&s;on they form treaties of alliance to guarantee each other in their conque&s;ts, and in the property which they have in the people.&mdash;In pur&s;uance of this policy, the prince of Piedmont, in the cour&s;e of that long Spani&s;h war which I have mentioned, purcha&s;ed with the blood and trea&s;ure of your nation, the title of king of Sardi|nia; and at the clo&s;e of the war, he obtained from the hou&s;es of Au&s;tria and Bourbon, and from the king of England, a guarantee of the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>

have any intere&s;t in extending or contracting the territorial limits of a &s;tate.

And whenever it &s;hould be found more convenient to change them, they might be extended or contracted on the &s;ame principle, without injury to any per|&s;on, and without exciting the jealou&s;y of any nation.</P>
<P>I could cite you many in&s;tances from the United States of America, in which this theory has been carried into practice; which would prove to you that the doctrine I here advance, as one of the effects of liberty, is not chimerical. But an in&s;tance more &s;triking to you, and which will form an epoch in the hi&s;tory of Europe, is the conduct of the national convention of France on the propo&s;iti|on of Savoy to be united to that republic. Here we &s;ee a &s;overeign people, uninfluenced by any fears, hopes, or connections from abroad, deliberating in the mo&s;t &s;olemn manner, whether they will extend their territorial boundaries, by the admi&s;&s;ion of &s;even new provinces, inhabited by four hundred thou&s;and freemen who had &s;ent their deputies to &s;olicit an union.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>The &s;even provinces which formed the Dutchy of Savoy, now united to France, under the name of the department of</HI> Mont Blanc, <HI>were Savoy proper, Genevois, Carouge, Chablois, Fauchigny, Tarent<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i&s;e, and Maurienne.</HI></NOTE> To rai&s;e a que&s;tion on a pro|po&s;ition of this kind is certainly a new thing in politics.

an acqui&s;ition to his dominions. But the members of the convention who deliberated on this que&s;tion had no per&s;onal intere&s;t to &s;erve, no ambition to gratify. It was merely a que&s;tion of national con|venience, whether the fr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ntiers of the republic &s;hould remain fixed on the limits of Dauphiny and Lyonnois, or be extended to the Alps which ap|pear to be the natural boundary of France.</P>
<P>The latter opinion prevailed; but it was rather on account of the pre&s;ent circum&s;tances of Italy than of France. Italy is &s;till governed by de&s;pots; and it is to be expected, that as long as they re|main in power, they will continue the war they have undertaken again&s;t the French. To prevent their incur&s;ions, it was nece&s;&s;ary to oppo&s;e them the barrier of the Alps. But if Italy were as free as France, all cau&s;es of ho&s;tility between them would be for ever removed. It would be &s;carcely po&s;&s;ible in the cour&s;e of human events, that they would ever more have any ground of con|tention.

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE following little poem was publi&s;hed in London, in February 1792. It happened that two of the principal con&s;pirators, the emperor Leopold, and the king of Sweden, died in a few weeks after. The oppo&s;ite effects, produced by the death of the&s;e two per&s;ons, are very remarkable. From a view of the general character of the king of Sweden, and of the particular tran&s;actions of the la&s;t year of his life, there can be no doubt but he was de|termined
<PB N="238" REF="030026_0235_0FE404D85A472088">
to go any lengths with the powers which were then confederating again&s;t the liberty of France; and it is a con&s;olation to human nature, that the violent death of our &s;ceptred mad-man has &s;aved the people of Sweden from tho&s;e horrid &s;cenes of &s;laughter which now involve mo&s;t of the neighbouring nations.</P>
<P>The character of Leopold, in &s;ome of its lead|ing traits, was directly the rever&s;e of that of Gu&s;|tavus. The latter was prodigal of wealth, and exce&s;&s;ively eager for what is called military fame, without the capacity or the means of acquiring it; the former was affectedly pacific, moderate in mo&s;t of his vices, and remarkable for nothing but his avarice. He had &s;en&s;e enough to &s;ee that nothing was to be gained by a war with France; his ava|rice, had he lived, would have been a &s;ufficient guarantee again&s;t that event: and his death may be con&s;idered as the immediate cau&s;e of the war.</P>
<P>The treaty of Pilnitz was doubtle&s;s fabricated in the court of Paris. The emperor agreed to it, for the purpo&s;e of duping the king of Pru&s;&s;ia into mea&s;ures which might &s;ecure the obedience of the people of Brabant, whom he had pacified the year before by a cruel deception. His de&s;ign was like|wi&s;e to deceive, the emigrant princes, who were then deceiving him; and to exhibit &s;uch a menac|ing appearance, as, according to his calculation, would induce the French people to &s;et down qui|etly under a limited monarchy; well knowing that, if they did this, their government would &s;oon degenerate into a de&s;poti&s;m, which would conti|nue to give countenance to the general principle that had &s;o long en&s;laved the nations of Europe.</P>
<P>That he never intended, or had relinqui&s;hed the intention, of executing the conditions of the
<PB N="239" REF="030026_0236_0FE4051E8B5DB6B8">
treaty of Pilnitz by going to war with France, is evident from the following con&s;iderations: the French con&s;titution was ratified, and the revolution &s;uppo&s;ed to be fini&s;hed, in September 1791. A war, to overturn that con&s;titution, certainly ought not to have been deferred beyond the in&s;uing &s;pring; and as it would require an army of two or three hundred thou&s;and men, the winter mu&s;t have been occupied in making the preparations. Leopold died &s;uddenly, about the fir&s;t of March. At that time no preparation<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> had been made for offen&s;ive ho&s;tilities. The number of troops &s;ent from Au&s;tria into the Low Countries, during the autumn and winter, was not more than was &s;tipu|lated to be maintained there, and were &s;carcely &s;ufficient to enforce the de&s;poti&s;m to which he had de&s;tined that unhappy people. Before the death of Leopold, the French emigrants at Cobl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">z began to de&s;pair. The hopes they had built on the treaty of Pilnitz had nearly vani&s;hed; the princes had an army of forty thou&s;and gentlemen to maintain; Louis was carrying on too great a &s;y&s;tem of cor|ruption at home, to be able to &s;upply them with money from the <HI>civil li&s;t</HI>; they had exhau&s;ted their credit in all the merchantile towns in Europe; and Leopold, con&s;idering them in the character of beggars, began to treat them as trouble&s;ome gue&s;ts; for none of the objects of their demands could be flattering to his favourite pa&s;&s;ion. At la&s;t, to their great &s;atisfaction, the emperor died; and his &s;y&s;|tem with regard to France was either never under|&s;tood by his own mini&s;ters, or it was laid a&s;ide, in compliance with the predominant pa&s;&s;ions of his &s;on; which happened to be for war, expence, and unqualified de&s;poti&s;m.</P>
<P><PB N="240" REF="030026_0237_0FE404DDF6C70688">This young man began his career by a &s;olemn declaration to all the powers of Europe, that he &s;hould follow preci&s;ely the &s;y&s;tem of his father, with re&s;pect to the affairs of France. This de|claration might be under&s;tood to mean the open and avowed &s;y&s;tem, pre&s;cribed by the treaty of Pilnitz, or the &s;ecret and unexplained &s;y&s;tem, which was to avoid the war. It was univer&s;ally under&s;tood, as it was doubtle&s;s meant, in favour of the avowed &s;y&s;tem; who&s;e object, announced in the treaty, was "<HI>to &s;upport the rights of crowns.</HI>"</P>
<P>From this moment, a &s;pirit of ho&s;tility was provoked by the court of Vienna, and encouraged by the French amba&s;&s;ador there, who, like their other amba&s;&s;adors of that day, was betraying the nation, to &s;erve the king; till, on the 20th of April, war was declared by the National A&s;&s;em|bly. In this war the de&s;pots of Europe will try their &s;trength, and will probably &s;oon be ex|hau&s;ted.</P>

<HEAD>NOTE ON MR. BURKE. [Referring to page <HI>247.</HI>]</HEAD>
<P>* SOME of the author's friends in England, although <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hey join with him in cen&s;uring the wri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ings <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">f Mr. Burke on the French revolution, are of op<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n that the picture here drawn of that writer is too highly col<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d; or a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> lea&s;t, that the cen&s;ure is &s;o &s;evere as to lo&s;e the effect <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hat it might otherwi&s;e produce. It i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ay what effect, or whether any, has or will be produced by this poe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">; but, out of re&s;pect to the opinion above &s;tated, it may be proper to m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ke &s;ome ob|&s;ervations on the effect that has already followed from the writing of Mr. Burke. I &s;peak not of what has taken place in England; where it is &s;uppo&s;ed that, con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rary to his intentions and tho&s;e of the government that &s;et him at work, his mali|cious attack upon liberty has opened a di&s;cu&s;&s;ion which cannot be clo&s;ed until the whole &s;y&s;tem of de&s;poti&s;m, which he meant to &s;upport, &s;hall be overturned in that country. The pre&s;ent war with France is doubtle&s;s the la&s;t piece of delu&s;ion that a &s;et of hereditary tyrants will ever be able to impo&s;e upon the people of England,</P>
<P>But this &s;ubject opens a field of contemplation far m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">re &s;erious and exten&s;ive on the con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">inent of Europe; where, if Mr. Burke can view without horror the immen&s;ity of the mi&s;chiefs he has done, he will &s;how him&s;elf worthy of much higher at|tributes of wickedne&s;s than have yet been a&s;cribed to him. It is a painful ta&s;k to traver&s;e &s;uch a wide &s;cene of &s;laughter and de&s;olation as now involves the nations of Europe, and then to lay it all to the charge of a &s;ingle individual; e&s;pecially when we con&s;ider that individual as having, for a long time
<PB N="253" REF="030026_0250_0FE40538DA94DAF8">
before, enjoyed the confidence of all good men, and having at la&s;t betrayed it from the wor&s;t and vile&s;t motives; as he had e&s;tabli&s;hed his previous reputation by &s;peaking the language of liberty, and profe&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to be the friend of national felicity. But it is not from a tran&s;itory di&s;gu&s;t at his dete&s;tible principles, it is from deliberate ob&s;ervation and mature conviction, that I &s;tate it as an hi&s;torical fact, That the pre&s;ent war, with all its train of calamities, mu&s;t be attributed al|mo&s;t exclu&s;ively to the pen of Mr. Burke.</P>
<P>There is a peculiar combination of circum|&s;tances which threw this power into his hands, and which ought to be duly con&s;idered, before we come to a deci&s;ion on the &s;ubject. The people of England had enjoyed for &s;everal ages a much greater portion of liberty than any other people in Europe. This had rai&s;ed them to a great degree of eminence in many re&s;pects. At the &s;ame time that it rendered them powerful as a nation, it made them &s;ober, indu&s;trious, and per&s;evering, as individuals; it taught them to think and &s;peak with a certain air of dignity, independence, and preci&s;ion, which was unknown in other coun|tries. This circum&s;tance could not fail to gain the admiration of foreigners, and to excite a per|petual emulation among them&s;elves. England has therefore produced more than her proportion of the illu&s;trious men of modern times, e&s;pecially in politics and legi&s;lation, as the&s;e affairs came with|in the reach of a larger cla&s;s of men in that coun|try than in any other.</P>
<P>In a nation where there is an enormous civil li&s;t at the di&s;po&s;al of the crown, and a con&s;titu|tional &s;pirit of liberty kept alive in the people, we mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily expect to find two parties in the
<PB N="254" REF="030026_0251_0FE4053EB9D91500">
government. In &s;uch a ca&s;e, as the king is &s;ure to carry all the mea&s;ures that he dares to propo&s;e, the party in favour of the people are called the <HI>op|po&s;ition</HI>; and it being always a minority, it gives occa&s;ion for great exertion of talents, and is &s;up|po&s;ed to be the nur&s;e of every public virtue. Such has been the compo&s;ition of the Engli&s;h govern|ment ever &s;ince the la&s;t revolution. The oppo|&s;ition has been the &s;chool of great men; its prin|cipal di&s;ciples have been the apo&s;tles of liberty; and their exertions have made the Briti&s;h name re&s;pectable in every part of the world. Mr. Burke had been for many years at the head of this &s;chool; and from the brilliant talents he di&s;cover|ed in that con&s;picuous &s;tation, he rendered him&s;elf univer&s;ally re&s;pected. His eloquence was of that flowery and figurative kind, which attracted great admiration in foreign countries; where it was viewed, for the mo&s;t part, through the medium of a tran&s;lation; &s;o that he was con&s;idered, at lea&s;t in every country out of England, as the able&s;t advo|cate of liberty that then exi&s;ted in Europe. Even kings and tyrants, who hated the cau&s;e, could not withhold their veneration from the man.</P>
<P>Under the&s;e impre&s;&s;ions, their attention was called to the great event of the French revolution. It was a &s;ubject which they did not under&s;tand, a bu&s;ine&s;s in which they had no intention to inter|fere; as it was evidently no concern of theirs. But viewed as a &s;peculative point, it is as natural for kings as for other per&s;ons to wait till they learn what great men have &s;aid, before they form their opinion. Mr. Burke did not &s;uffer them to remain long in &s;u&s;pen&s;e; but, to enlighten their under&s;tandings and teach them how to judge, he came forward with his "<HI>Reflections on the Revolu|tion
<PB N="255" REF="030026_0252_0FE405415558D418">
in France</HI>;" where, in his quality of the po|litical &s;chool-ma&s;ter of his age, in his quality of the profe&s;&s;ed enemy of tyrants, the friend of the people, and the mo&s;t enlightened leader of the mo&s;t enlightened nation in Europe, he tells them that this revolution is an abominable u&s;urpation of a gang of beggarly tyrants; that its principle is athei&s;m and anarchy; that its in&s;truments are murders, rapes, and plunders; that its object is to hunt down religion, overturn &s;ociety, and de|luge the world in blood. Then, in the whining cant of &s;tate-piety, and in the cowardly in&s;olence of per&s;onal &s;afety, he calls upon the principal &s;overeigns of Europe to unite in a general confed|eration, to march into France, to interfere in the affairs of an independent power, to make war with the principles which he him&s;elf had long la|boured to &s;upport, to overturn the noble&s;t monu|ment of human wi&s;dom, and bla&s;t the faire&s;t hopes of public happine&s;s that the world had ever &s;een.</P>
<P>Copies of his book were &s;ent in great profu&s;ion by the courts of London and Paris to the other courts of Europe; it was read by all men of let|ters, and by all men of &s;tate, with an avidity in|&s;pired by the celebrity of the author and the mag|nitude of the &s;ubject; and it produced an effect which, in other circum&s;tances, would have ap|peared almo&s;t miraculous; e&s;pecially when we con&s;ider the intrin&s;ic character of the work. M. de Calonne, about the &s;ame time, publi&s;hed a book of much more internal merit; a book in which fal&s;ehood is clothed in a more decent covering; and in which there is more energy and argument, to excite the champions of de&s;poti&s;m to begin the work of de&s;olation. But Calonne wrote and ap|peared
<PB N="256" REF="030026_0253_0FE405430888D850">
in his true character. It was known that he had been a robber in France, and was now an exile in England; and, while he herded with the Engli&s;h robbers at St. James's, he wrote to revenge him&s;elf upon the country who&s;e ju&s;tice he had e&s;caped. His writings, therefore, had but little weight; perhaps as little as Mr. Burke's would have had, if his real object had been known.</P>
<P>But this illu&s;trious hypocrite po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed every ad|vantage for deception. He palmed him&s;elf upon the world as a volunteer in the general cau&s;e of philanthropy. Giving him&s;elf up to the frenzy of an unbridled imagination, he conceives him&s;elf writing tragedy, without being confined to the obvious laws of fiction; and taking advantage of the recency of the events, and of the ignorance of tho&s;e who were to read his rhap&s;odies, he peoples France with a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins, for the &s;ake of rai&s;ing a hue-and-cry again&s;t its peaceable inhabitants; he paints ideal murders, that they may be avenged by the reality of a wide extended &s;laughter; he tran&s;|forms the milde&s;t and mo&s;t generous people in Europe into a nation of mon&s;ters and athei&s;ts, "heaping mountains upon mountains, and wag|ing war with heaven," that he may intere&s;t the con&s;ciences of one part of his readers, and cloak the hypocri&s;y of another, to induce them both to renounce the character of men, while they avenge the cau&s;e of God.</P>
<P>Such was the fir&s;t picture of the French revo|lution pre&s;ented at once to the eyes of all the men who held the reins of government in the &s;everal &s;tates of Europe; and &s;uch was the authority of the author by whom it was pre&s;ented, that we are not to be a&s;toni&s;hed at the effect. The emigrant princes, and the agents of the court of the Thuil|leries,
<PB N="257" REF="030026_0254_0FE40544B6CB4C48">
who were then be&s;ieging the anti-chambers of mini&s;ters in every country, found a new &s;ource of impudence in this extraordinary work. They found their own invented fictions confirmed in their fulle&s;t latitude, and a rich variety of &s;uper|added fal&s;ehood, of which the mo&s;t &s;hamele&s;s &s;yco|phant of Louis or of Cond&eacute; would blu&s;h to have been the author. With this book in their hands, it was ea&s;y to gain the ear of men already predi&s;|po&s;ed to li&s;ten to any project which might rivet the chains of their fellow creatures.</P>
<P>The&s;e arguments, detailed by proper agents, induced &s;ome of the principal &s;overeigns of Eu|rope to agree to the treaty of Pilnits; then the death of Leopold, as I have &s;tated in the preface, unhappily removed the great ob&s;tacle to the exe|cution of that treaty, and the war of Mr. Burke was let loo&s;e, with all the horrors he intended to excite. And what is the language proper to be u&s;ed in de&s;cribing the character of a man, who, in his &s;ituation, at his time of life, and for a pen&s;ion of only fifteen hundred pounds a year, could &s;it down deliberately in his clo&s;et and call upon the powers of earth and hell to inflict &s;uch a weight of mi&s;ery on the human race? When we &s;ee Alex|ander depopulating kingdoms and reducing great cities to a&s;hes, we tran&s;port our&s;elves to the age in which he lived, when human &s;laughter was hu|man glory; and we make &s;ome allowance for the ravings of ambition. If we contemplate the frightful cruelties of Cortez and Pizarro, we view their characters as a compo&s;ition of avarice, and fanatici&s;m; we &s;ee them in&s;atiable of wealth, and mad with the idea of extending the knowledge o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> their religion. But here is a man who calls him|&s;elf a philo&s;opher, not remarkable for his avarice,
<PB N="258" REF="030026_0255_0FE4054A2F8511D0">
the delight and ornament of a numerous &s;ociety of valuable friends, re&s;pected by all enlightened men as a friend of peace and preacher of humanity, living in an age when military madne&s;s has lo&s;t its charms, and men begin to unite in &s;earching the means of avoiding the horrors of war; this man, wearied with the happine&s;s that &s;urrounds him, and di&s;gu&s;ted at the glory that a waits him, renoun|ces all his friends, belies the doctrines of his for|mer life, bewails that the military &s;avagene&s;s of the fourteenth century is pa&s;t away, and, to gratify his barbarous wi&s;hes to call it back, conjures up a war, in which at lea&s;t two millions of his fellow creatures mu&s;t be &s;acrificed to his unaccountable pa&s;&s;ion. Such is the condition of human nature, that the greate&s;t crimes have u&s;ually gone unpu|ni&s;hed. It appears to me, that hi&s;tory does not furni&s;h a greater one than this of Mr. Burke; and yet all the con&s;olation that we can draw from the detection, is to leave the man to his own reflecti|ons, and expo&s;e his conduct to the execration of po&s;terity.</P>
