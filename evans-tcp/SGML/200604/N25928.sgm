<Q><L>But where to find that happie&s;t &s;pot below&mdash;</L>
<L>Who can direct, when all pretend to know?</L>
<BIBL><HI>GOLDSMITH.</HI></BIBL></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IT is a common place ob&s;ervation "that man is born with a capacity to enjoy happine&s;s." Each one believes this true in theory, and imagines, how|ever others have failed of practically verifying it, he &s;hall certainly be an illu&s;trious in&s;tance of its ex|emplification. His predece&s;&s;or has blindly mi&s;taken the way, and he has found it; but at the clo&s;e of life, when he is taking a retro&s;pective view of his journey, he finds that he has been pur&s;uing a phan|tom, like tho&s;e who went before him, and while, with the wi&s;e man, he exclaims that "all is vanity," he feels, on his dying bed, experimental evidence, that the only real "good under the &s;un, is for a man to eat, and drink, and enjoy the fruit of his labour, for that is the gift of God."</P>
<P>Something here is in the wrong. Either happi|ne&s;s is not to be obtained in this world, or tho&s;e who &s;eek it mi&s;take the road which leads to it. Un|doubtedly the former is the fact&mdash;though I believe, much more felicity might be enjoyed than there is, if people knew how to &s;eek for it. If the intellectu|al
<PB N="4" REF="034482_0003_0FFDE742E93996C0">
faculties of man, did not participate in his joys and &s;orrows, his tranquility would but rarely be di&s;|turbed, where objects for &s;en&s;ual gratification were within his reach. Having &s;atisfied the claims of hunger and thir&s;t, and protected his body from in|clement &s;ea&s;ons, his remaining care would be, to &s;ooth the calls of &s;en&s;uality, by indulgence to the full. But this is not the ca&s;e. Man is created with a &s;en&s;ual, and a mental, capacity for enjoyment.&mdash; The&s;e are not unfrequently in direct oppo&s;ition at each other, where the &s;en&s;es de&s;ire what rea&s;on di&s;approves. Notwith&s;tanding they are often at variance, yet they are perfectly reconcilable; and when in harmony, a rational indulgence of the one, will contribute much to the gratification of the o|ther. But the pa&s;&s;ions get the &s;tart in infancy, and by the time that rea&s;on begins to exerci&s;e its influ|ence, they have generally become &s;o head&s;trong, that they turn a deaf ear to her advice, and like Je|hu, drive furiou&s;ly after their enemy.</P>
<P>The infant &s;carcely opens its eyes before it cries for the moon. It is a plea&s;ing object to its &s;ight, and rea&s;on has not yet taught it to know the im|po&s;&s;ibility of its indulgence. The &s;chool-boy finds his gratification, at times, in his bow and arrow, in his popgun, in his &s;kates, his hoop and his whi&s;tle&mdash; and, although actual po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion at this time of life, affords more la&s;ting contentment, than at any &s;ub|&s;equent period, yet, even now, it is fleeting; it fades with the novelty of its object, and is forgotten almo&s;t as &s;oon as known. How &s;oon will the boy forget his whi&s;tle, when his comrade produces a jews harp? And how readily does the jews-harp give place to the top? as childhood draws to a clo&s;e, the childi&s;h &s;ports are laid a&s;ide, and the young man places his happine&s;s in his hor&s;es, his beauty, the favorable reception which he may meet with among the young ladies, or on &s;ome other object equally
<PB N="5" REF="034482_0003_0FFDE742E93996C0">
trivial. It is not enough that he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the&s;e&mdash; but they mu&s;t be pre-eminently his. So long as his hor&s;e is the hand&s;ome&s;t and mo&s;t the &s;ubject of com|mendation, he is contented with it. But no &s;ooner does his town&s;men appear with a hand&s;omer hor&s;e, and a fine new chai&s;e, than his own loo&s;es half its value, and immediately he &s;ets his thoughts at work to invent how he can &s;urpa&s;s his comrade in both. Suppo&s;e he does it. His happine&s;s is again di&s;&s;ipated the moment he &s;ees an acquaintance in his phaeton, drawn by his &s;pan and driven by his &s;ervant.&mdash; Should he procure the&s;e, his felicity would again be de&s;troyed by the fir&s;t coack and four which he &s;aw.</P>
<P>A &s;mall part even of our temporal happine&s;s con|&s;i&s;ts in actual po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. While an object of de&s;ire is contemplated in futurity, we behold in it nothing but that which promi&s;es plea&s;ure. When obtained, though it may po&s;&s;e&s;s all that which made it de&s;ira|ble while at a di&s;tance, it is found u&s;ually to po&s;&s;e&s;s more. The ro&s;e blo&s;&s;oms on a briar bu&s;h, and the &s;un too long beheld, de&s;troys the &s;ight. To illu&s;|trate the foregoing, we will turn our thoughts, for a moment, to a child, and follow him in his progre&s;s to old age. His fir&s;t great wi&s;h, which promi&s;es fe|licity, is to have his petticoats exchanged for a boy's dre&s;s. He &s;oon wants a penknife, a top or a pair of &s;kates. The&s;e afford him no permanent &s;atisfac|tion, until he can open the fir&s;t, &s;pin the &s;econd, and run upon the third. After he has learned the&s;e, do they &s;atisfy him? No; he now longs to be of age. At twenty-one years, he wants to be in bu|&s;ine&s;s by him&s;elf, to have a hou&s;e, and to be married. A wife cannot render him contented without chil|dren. Is he contented with the&s;e? He now mu&s;t have an e&s;tate to educate them, and to &s;ecure them from poverty, if he &s;hould die during their child|hood. How many anxieties does he feel on their account? If one of them is &s;ick, the parent takes

no re&s;t until he thinks him out of danger. When he is in health, his &s;olicitude is transferred to &s;ome other concern for the good of his child. After his children are reared up to manhood, he is unea&s;y un|til they are married and &s;ettled in life. His next wi&s;h mu&s;t be gratified, for without it, this is of no importance; he mu&s;t &s;ee their children&punc; and be con|vinced that his name will be perpetuated to po&s;teri|ty; el&s;e all his former cares, and anxieties, are not worth the trouble they have co&s;t. Does this grati|fy him? Is he now ready to re&s;ign up all to them, and be laid down in peace? No; all the &s;olicitude, the di&s;appointments, and mortifications, he has met with in this world, do not alienate his affections from life; nor does his experience yet make him feel that permanent happine&s;s cannot be procured. He will <HI>tell</HI> you that it cannot, before he is ten years old, but he never practically believes it until on his deathbed. I have known a man, of nearly four &s;core years, who had lived in &s;orrow all his days, and had &s;truggled with poverty and &s;ickne&s;s, during his whole life, who had been blind for about a year. Often has he told me, that all the troubles of his life were not half &s;o burthen&s;ome as the lo&s;s of his eye &s;ight. He had enjoyed it longer than the period u&s;ually allotted to man, and it had &s;erved him only to witne&s;s &s;cenes of pain and wretched|ne&s;s; yet he thought that if he could only have his &s;ight re&s;tored to him, if it was but ju&s;t enough for him to walk about, he &s;hould be <HI>perfectly happy.</HI>&mdash; Ju&s;t &s;uch creatures we are. When we po&s;&s;e&s;s a ble&s;&s;ing, we know not how valuable it is, nor how much our happine&s;s depends upon it, until we are deprived of it. Some future good allures us; and, when obtained, we find it not to po&s;&s;e&s;s <HI>that</HI> for which we &s;o earne&s;tly &s;ought it; and away our wi&s;hes fly to &s;omething <HI>&s;till remote</HI>&mdash;which, when <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">btained, &s;erves us in the &s;ame manner. And if

we were to pu&s;h on, like Alexander the Great, to the conque&s;t of the world, like him, we &s;hould &s;it down and cry when it was vanqui&s;hed; not becau&s;e we had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions enough, but becau&s;e there would be <HI>nothing more to &s;eek for.</HI></P>
<P>Providence has &s;o formed us, and &s;o variegated our lives, with good and evil, plea&s;ure and pain, happine&s;s and mi&s;ery, that we may not become &s;o attached to this world, as to be unwilling to pre|pare for another. He has &s;ent us here as gue&s;ts to an entertainment, in which there are nouri&s;hing and poi&s;onous ingredients. He has taught us how to di&s;tingui&s;h between them&mdash;has &s;et before us the &s;tronge&s;t motives to improve the one, and to &s;hun the other, and left us to exerci&s;e our own di&s;creti|on. Such was the ca&s;e with Eve, and &s;uch has been the ca&s;e with all of her de&s;cendants. The forbidden fruit "was fair to look upon," and &s;he eat it; and by eating it, &s;he lo&s;t paradi&s;e&mdash;tainted the whole of her de&s;cendants, and, from her, they inherit the &s;ame di&s;po&s;ition. They, like her, wan|der about in pur&s;uit of happine&s;s. She enjoyed it in paradi&s;e, and knew it not until it was forfeited. When forfeited, &s;he &s;ought in vain to find it on earth. She lo&s;t it for her children, and they will, like her, &s;eek it in vain, unle&s;s they pur&s;ue it in that road which will re-conduct them to paradi&s;e.</P>

<P>WHOSOEVER will be married, before all things it is nece&s;&s;ary that he hold the conju|gal faith; and the conjugal faith is this: That there were two rational beings created, both equal, and yet one &s;uperior to the other&mdash;and the inferi|or &s;hall bear rule over the &s;uperior; which faith, except every one keep whole, and undefiled, with|out doubt, he &s;hall be &s;colded at everla&s;tingly.</P>

<P>The woman is commanded to obey the man, and the man ought to obey the woman; and yet there are not two obedients, but one obedient.</P>
<P>For there is one dominion nominal of the hu&s;band, and another dominion real of the wife.</P>
<P>And yet there are not two dominions but one dominion.</P>
<P>For, like as we are compelled by the chri&s;tian verity to acknowledge, that wives mu&s;t &s;ubmit them&s;elves to their hu&s;bands, and be &s;ubject to them in all things;</P>
<P>So we are forbidden by the conjugal faith to &s;ay, that they &s;hould be at all influenced by their wills, or pay regard to their commands.</P>
<P>The man was not created for the woman, but the woman for the man;</P>
<P>Yet the man &s;hall be the &s;lave of the woman, and the woman the tyrant of the man:</P>
<P>So that in all things, as afore&s;aid, the &s;ubjection of the &s;uperior to the inferior is to be believed.</P>
<P>He, therefore, that will be married, mu&s;t thus think of the woman and the man.</P>
<P>Furthermore, it is nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive matri|mony, that he al&s;o believe rightly the infallibility of the wife.</P>

<P>Perfectly fallible and perfectly infallible; of an erring &s;oul and unerring mind &s;ub&s;i&s;ting; fallible, as touching human nature; and infallible, as touch|ing her female &s;ex.</P>
<P>Who, although &s;he be fallible and infallible, yet &s;he is not two, but one woman; who &s;ubmitted to lawful marriage to acquire unlawful dominion, and

<HEAD>GAMING.</HEAD>
<P>GAMING is the cur&s;e that &s;preads the wide&s;t, and &s;ticks the clo&s;e&s;t to the pre&s;ent times: All ranks and degrees of people are infected with it; it is the livelihood of many, and &s;o countenanced by all, that it is almo&s;t &s;candalous to forbear it, and e&s;teemed down-right ill-breeding to expo&s;e it. But where|ever you are, if cards are called for, let it be a &s;ignal for you to take your leave. Nor let the propo&s;al of a trifling &s;take be a bait to induce you to &s;it
<PB N="10" REF="034482_0006_0FFDE748E47F4EB8">
down: Adventurers heat them&s;elves by play, as cowards by wine; and he that began timorou&s;ly, may, by degrees, &s;urpa&s;s the whole party in ra&s;h|ne&s;s and extravagance. Be&s;ides, as avarice is one of our &s;tronge&s;t pa&s;&s;ions, &s;o nothing flatters it more than play. Good &s;ucce&s;s has an almo&s;t irre&s;i&s;table charm, and ill prompts us to put all to the hazard, to recover our lo&s;&s;es; either way, nothing is more infatuating, or de&s;tructive.</P>
<P>This is but a faint &s;ketch of the mi&s;chiefs attend|ing gaming, even upon the &s;quare; but, where it is otherwi&s;e, which often happens, as numbers have found to their co&s;t, what can &s;ave the wretched bubble from imminent and inevitable ruin; or who can enumerate the &s;nares, the blinds, the lures em|ployed by &s;harpers, to entrap their prey, and ratify the premeditated mi&s;chief? To be &s;afe, then, keep out of the po&s;&s;ibility of danger. Strangers, how|ever dazzling their appearance, are always to be mi&s;tru&s;ted. Even per&s;ons who prided them&s;elves on their birth, rank and fortune, have been found confederates with the&s;e &s;plendid pick-pockets. And to play with your friends, is an infallible receipt to lo&s;e them; for, if you plunder them, they'll aban|don you with re&s;entment: and, if they plunder you, they'll decline an interview, that mu&s;t be at|tended with &s;ecret ill-will, if not open reproaches. To avoid all the&s;e hazards, play not at all; but, when you find your&s;elf giving way to the dange|rous temptation, by ca&s;ting your eyes on tho&s;e who gain a livelihood by the&s;e execrable means, let their dete&s;ted reputations, and the contempt always con|nected with them, deter you from the dete&s;table ambition of making your way to fortune by the &s;ame infernal road; or, if that reflection proves ineffectual for your pre&s;ervation, look with horror on the num|bers of meagre faces that haunt gaming hou&s;es, as gho&s;ts are &s;aid to do the places where their trea&s;ure

<HEAD>THE POOR MAN's APOLOGY For marrying a <HI>POOR WOMAN.</HI></HEAD>
<P>MY lot was ca&s;t among tho&s;e to whom fortune deals her favors &s;paringly: nature, as if to make amends for the niggardline&s;s of the capricious god|de&s;s, made me heir to a con&s;titution, though not the mo&s;t robu&s;t, equal to the &s;tation heaven had allotted to me; and I thought my condition enviable, endu|ed as I was with fortitude &s;ufficient to encounter poverty in wedlock. All my acquaintance cried &s;hame on the man who had been &s;o blind to his in|tere&s;t, and in the mo&s;t unre&s;erved terms cen&s;ured me for &s;haking hands with beggary. The cu&s;tom of this thrifty age, indeed, and the oppre&s;&s;ive tem|per of the times, gave a color of ju&s;tice to a cen&s;ure apparently dictated by friend&s;hip. Neverthele&s;s their remon&s;trances made but a tran&s;ient impre&s;&s;ion on a mind like mine, which had armed it&s;elf again&s;t the vici&s;&s;itudes of the world by the following reflec|tions, previous to the &s;olemn engagement into which I had entered.</P>
<P>Every man who marries without a fortune, pledg|es him&s;elf to the &s;tate for his indu&s;try; after having turned the matter in my mind, I am the more con|vinced that my country has a &s;imilar claim upon me. But &s;hall I marry to gratify the inclinations of others, perhaps to humor their caprices? or indulge a wi&s;h of my own? Some friends I have, who are very importunate with me to be directed by them&mdash;one tells me, he has had in his eye for me, ever &s;ince my birth, a lady who is immen&s;ely rich, but mon|&s;trou&s;ly hunchbacked withall, and arrived at the &s;o|ber age of &s;ixty&mdash;from her having been un&s;olicited
<PB N="12" REF="034482_0007_0FFDE74A79564C88">
&s;o long, I mu&s;t needs &s;uppo&s;e her to be the refuge of her whole &s;ex. Now, &s;hould I, in a fit of in&s;ani|ty, for nothing &s;hort of a derangement of my intel|lects could urge me to the ra&s;h act, link my&s;elf to decrepidate, and her di&s;po&s;ition be as crooked as her per&s;on, where &s;hould I hope for redre&s;s? Could this friend of mine di&s;&s;olve the tie, or I recal my words? No, the words are irrevocable, the bond indi&s;&s;oluble, "till death doth us part." To wi&s;h that death would &s;tep in, to rid me of my incum|brance, by &s;ummoning away my joke fellow, or my|&s;elf, would be &s;inful; be&s;ides that &s;uch a wi&s;h would be fruitle&s;s for &s;he might live long enough to break my heart. At her age, the turbulence of the pa&s;|&s;ions is &s;uppo&s;ed to be calmed, it is true; but were the forty years younger, would that better my &s;itua|tion? Upon con&s;ideration I think it would not; by the time a woman &s;its down to &s;erious hou&s;ewifery, her marriage portion is &s;pent in the indulgencies, which &s;he expects for&s;ooth in con&s;ideration of her dower. Hence I conclude, that my friend, in his recommendation of a wife to me, is actuated by no other motive than his pride, which would be wound|ed by his owning a poor relative. So help me God then, I will chu&s;e for my&s;elf, and woo happine&s;s in a per&s;on who&s;e di&s;po&s;ition I think congenial to my own.</P>

<P>IN the book of Eccle&s;ia&s;tes, we find related in a very familiar and &s;imple apologue, the &s;iege of a certain city.

<P>FROM my attachment to &s;implicity in writing, I read Sterne more attentively than Stackhou&s;e, and prefer a &s;tory in Gene&s;is to a volume of Gibbon.&mdash; It appears to me that, notwith&s;tanding the &s;arca&s;ms of Voltaire, and other French infidels, that mode of writing, which finds a ready way to the heart, was never more &s;ucce&s;sfully atchieved, than by the Ori|entals.

<P>Abraham a mo&s;t affectionate parent, perceiving that his life declined, and zealous with the anxiety of old age, for an e&s;tabli&s;hment for I&s;aac, intreats a confidential &s;teward of the hou&s;ehold, that he would not &s;uffer the inexperienced heart of his &s;on to be captivated by the Canaaniti&s;h beauties. At the ear|ne&s;t reque&s;t of the patriarch, the &s;ervant binds him|&s;elf to &s;olicit for I&s;aac a wife of his own rank, reli|gion, and country. After &s;anctioning this promi&s;e by one of the mo&s;t tremendeous oaths among the Jewi&s;h u&s;ages, he harne&s;&s;es his camels, and departs for Me&s;opotamia. On his arrival at the &s;uburbs of Nahor, a city of that country, fatigued with a te|dious journey, and tender of his drudging camels, he makes them kneel by a well of water, to take their nece&s;&s;ary refre&s;hment. In this weary moment, Re|bekah appears; and the fir&s;t accents that fall from the parched tongue of the traveller, were to &s;olicit a little water from the pitcher, which &s;he carried, "<HI>And &s;he made ha&s;te, and let down her pitcher from her &s;houlder and &s;aid, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink al&s;o.</HI>"</P>

<L>&mdash;To unfold</L>

<P>But the night is not only propitious to &s;pecula|tive, but likewi&s;e to gay and &s;ocial men. Even the rigid Dr. John&s;on was &s;o convinced that late hours were auxiliary to the <HI>fea&s;t of rea&s;on and the flow of &s;oul,</HI> that he u&s;ed to declare "no man, but a &s;coun|drel went to bed before midnight." This expre&s;|&s;ion was perhaps too &s;trong, and he would not have u&s;ed it, had he lived in a farm hou&s;e. But his love of the conver&s;ation of men of letters and his experi|ence that fancy is generally mo&s;t wakeful, when dulne&s;s &s;leeps, tempted him to employ a phra&s;e which mu&s;t &s;tartle every labourer, who, by mere la&s;&s;itude of limb is compelled early to retire.</P>
<P>But night is friendly to playful no le&s;s than to met|aphy&s;ical, and ab&s;tract thought, not only the author and &s;tate&s;man watch, but likewi&s;e the &s;ons of &s;ocia|bility and glee.

St. Paul avers that they that be drunken are drunken in the night, and I know that its broad mantle is frequent|ly employed to cover exce&s;s from the world. Still, the arrival of night is greeted by many, who wi&s;h neither to &s;leep nor drink it away. Conver&s;ation often holds a levee at midnight, and wit and &s;enti|ment and &s;ong like the Fairies, a&s;&s;emble and &s;port before the cock crow.

<P><PB N="47" REF="034482_0024_0FFDE78314A79518">In this manner he continued his journey till the &s;un approached his meridian, and the increa&s;ing heat preyed upon his &s;trength; he then looked care|fully round him, to di&s;cover &s;ome more agreeable and &s;hady path. On his right hand he &s;aw a grove, that &s;eemed to wave its &s;hades, as a &s;ign of invita|tion; he entered it, and found the coolne&s;s and ver|dure irre&s;tibly plea&s;ant. He did not, however, for|get whither he was travelling, but found a narrow way bordered with flowers, which appearing to have the &s;ame direction with the main road, he was plea&s;|ed that, by this happy experiment, he had found means to unite plea&s;ure with his bu&s;ine&s;s, and to gain the rewards of diligence, without &s;uffering its fatigues. He, therefore, for a time &s;till continued to walk, without the lea&s;t remi&s;&s;ion of his ardor, ex|cept that he was &s;ometimes tempted to &s;top by the mu&s;ic of the birds, whom the heat had a&s;&s;embled in the &s;hade; and &s;ometimes amu&s;ed him&s;elf with plucking the flowers which grew on either &s;ide, or the fruits that hung upon the branches. At la&s;t the green path began to decline from its fir&s;t direction, and to wind among hills and thickets, cooled with fountains, and murmuring with the falls of water. Here Obidah pau&s;ed for a time, and began to con&s;i|der whether it were &s;afe for him to for&s;ake any longer the known and open road; but remember|ing that the heat was now in its greate&s;t violence, and that the plain was du&s;ty and uneven, he re&s;olved to pur&s;ue the new path, which he &s;uppo&s;ed only to make a few meanders, in compliance with the vari|eties of the ground, and to end at la&s;t in the com|mon road.</P>
<P>Having thus calmed his &s;olicitude, he renewed his pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e, though he &s;u&s;pected he was not gaining ground. The unea&s;ine&s;s of his mind inclined him to lay hold on every new object, and gave way to

every &s;en&s;ation that might &s;ooth, or divert him.&mdash; He li&s;tened to every echo, he mounted every hill for a fre&s;h pro&s;pect, he turned a&s;ide to every ca&s;|cade, and plea&s;ed him&s;elf with tracing the cour&s;e of a gentle river that rolled among the trees, and wa|tered a large region with innumerable circumvolu|tions. In the&s;e amu&s;ements the hours pa&s;&s;ed away uncounted, his deviations had perplexed his memory and he knew not towards what point to travel.&mdash; He &s;tood pen&s;ive and confu&s;ed, afraid to go forward le&s;t he &s;hould go wrong, yet con&s;cious that the time of loitering was now pa&s;&s;ed. While he was thus tortured with uncertainty, the &s;ky was over&s;pread with clouds, the day vani&s;hed from before him, and a &s;udden tempe&s;t gathered round his head. He was now rou&s;ed from his danger to a quick and painful remembrance of his folly; he now &s;aw how happi|ne&s;s is lo&s;t when ea&s;e is con&s;ulted, and lamented the unmanly impatience that prompted him to &s;eek &s;hel|ter in the grove, and de&s;pi&s;ed the petty cur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o&s;ity that led him on from trifle to trifle; while he was thus reflecting&punc; the air grew blacker, and a clap of thunder broke his meditation.</P>
<P>He now re&s;olved to do what remained yet in his power, to tread b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">k the ground which he pa&s;&s;ed, and try to find &s;ome i&s;&s;ue, where the wood might open into the plain. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e pro&s;trated him&s;elf on the ground, and commended his life to the Lord of na|ture.

or whether he was every moment drawing nearer to &s;afety or di&s;truction. At length not fear but labour began to overcome him; his breath grew &s;hort, and his knees trembled, and he was on the point of ly|ing down in re&s;ignation to his fate, when he beheld, through the brambles, the glimmer of a taper. He advanced towards the light, and finding it proceed|ed from the cottage of a hermit, he called humbly at the door, and obtained admi&s;&s;ion.

<P>'Son &s;aid the hermit, let the errors and follies, the dangers and e&s;cape of this day, &s;ink deep into thine heart; remember, my &s;on, that human life is the journey of a day.

In a &s;hort time we remit our fervour, and endeavour to find &s;ome mitigation of our duty, and &s;ome more ea&s;y means of obtaining the &s;ame end. we then relax our vigour, and re&s;olve no longer to be terrified at crimes at a di&s;tance, but rely upon our own con&s;tan|cy, and venture to approach what we re&s;olve never to touch. We thus enter the bowers of ea&s;e, and repo&s;e in the &s;hades of &s;ecurity.

the gardens of plea&s;ure; we approach them with &s;cruple and he&s;itation, we enter them, but enter timorous and trembling, and always hope to pa&s;s through them without lo&s;ing the road of virtue, which we, for a while, keep in our &s;ight, and to which we propo&s;e to return. But temptation &s;uc|ceeds temptation, and one compliance prepares us for another; we in time lo&s;e the happine&s;s of inno|cence, and &s;olace our di&s;quiet with &s;en&s;ual gratifica|tions. By degrees we let fall the remembrance of our original intention, and quit the only adequate object of rational de&s;ire. We entangle our&s;elves in bu&s;ine&s;s, immerge our&s;elves in luxury, and rove through the labyrinths of incon&s;tancy, till the dark|ne&s;s of old age begins to invade us, and di&s;ea&s;e and anxiety ob&s;truct our way. We then look back upon our&s;elves with horror, with &s;orrow, with repen|tance; and wi&s;h, but too often vainly wi&s;h, that we had not for&s;aken the ways of virtue. Happy are they, my &s;on, who &s;hall learn, from thy example, not to de&s;pair, but &s;hall remember, that though the day is pa&s;t, and their &s;trength is wa&s;ted, there yet remains one effort to be made; that reformation is never hopele&s;s, nor &s;incere endeavours ever una&s;&s;i&s;|ted but the wanderer may at la&s;t return after all his errors; and he who implores &s;trength and cou|rage from above, &s;hall find danger and difficulty give way before him. Go now, my &s;on, to thy repo&s;e; commit thy&s;elf to the care of omnipotence, and when the morning calls again to toil, begin a new thy journey and thy life.'</P>

It was not the length of the way from Timnah; it was not the rugged road, nor the irk|&s;omene&s;s of a hard trotting mule; it was not a &s;troke of the &s;un, nor a bleak air that &s;hook the nerves, and pro&s;trated the life of Samp&s;on; for not one of the&s;e circum&s;tances is ever glanced at by the hi&s;torian; no, he &s;aw, in one of the &s;tews of Gaza, a venal beauty and was undone. His wit evapora|ted, his wi&s;dom turned babbler, he lo&s;t his vigilance, his eyes and his life.</P>
<P>One licentious indulgence excites to another. The blandi&s;hments of his courtezan allured to the cells of the whole &s;i&s;terhood. He lays his head in the lap of voluptuou&s;ne&s;s, and gives full &s;cope to criminal de&s;ire. For it came to pa&s;s afterwards, that he loved a woman in the valley of Sorek, who&s;e name was Delilah.</P>
<P>Let us ponder a little the hi&s;tory of the&s;e unlucky amours. A &s;ketch of the wars and vici&s;&s;itudes of pa&s;&s;ion is of more intere&s;t than the narrative of a battle or &s;iege, or the annals of an empire.</P>

it may be correct to view Samp&s;on, before he enter|ed the gates of Gaza, and after his acquaintance with two bad women.</P>
<P>His fir&s;t was by no means a love adventure. It was in the &s;tyle of chyvalry without a dam&s;el. Lurking in the vines of rude territory, a lion roared again&s;t our juvenile hero, who as it is in a lively man|ner expre&s;&s;ed, rent his verocious adver&s;ary, as he would have rent a kid. A bold encounter, but not half &s;o dangerous as the &s;miles of the lady in the valley of Sorek. Mere brute force, however was not the &s;ole attribute of Samp&s;on. For &s;even days he tortures the ingenuity of thirty friends to re|&s;olve an enigma. He had the palm of wit and the chaplets of victory; by his art he de&s;troys the pro|perty, and by his arm the life of his enemies. Not only the family of his father, Manoah, but the whole circumjacent region mu&s;t have rung with the prai&s;es of this youth of promi&s;e; and even indiffer|ent men, and ab&s;tract rea&s;ons would alertly from &s;uch impo&s;ing premi&s;es draw the happie&s;t conclu&s;ion.</P>
<P>But behold how, in one hour, &s;o great riches come to nought. Thus far, what a ti&s;&s;ue of brilliant atchievments do we admire! The next &s;cene is madly mortifying. In the very &s;ummer of the en|&s;uing page of his &s;tory what are the humiliating particulars of his downfall? Samp&s;on, the valiant, the witty and the wi&s;e, is the dupe of female jug|glers; is enticed; is overcome. In the arms of a "twining Lais" of the Phili&s;tines, his &s;uperna|tural &s;trength melts away. He awakes out of his lethargy of plea&s;ure, and hopes to go out, as at other times, rejoicing in his might. But the ener|gy of the &s;oul is no more. He, whom once nothing could re&s;train, is bound. He grinds in the pri&s;on hou&s;e, and dwindled into a buffoon, is <HI>inve&s;ted with his motley</HI> to amu&s;e the rabble.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="034482_0031_0FFDE7999F04B068">In the life of this extraordinary per&s;onage it is a matter of regretful &s;peculation that the field of ho|nor &s;hould be changed for the valley of Sorek. Hence an abundant crop of evil. It was not the Phili&s;tines, it was impure pa&s;&s;ion that extingui&s;hed the di&s;cernment of Samp&s;on. He never &s;aw any object clearly, after he went to Gaza, and &s;aw an harlot. It is true, he &s;aw Delilah, but probably, through the ob&s;curity of nocturnal hours. Of her arts, of her perils, he &s;urely ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> but an imperfect vi&s;ion.

<P>Genius, &s;aid the amiable clergyman, with whom I &s;tudied divinity, is invariably connected with &s;trong pa&s;&s;ions.

The in&s;en&s;ible lounger, the &s;elf engro&s;&s;ed coxcomb, may &s;leep upon the knees of Delilah, and wake again to puny life. But of that opiate of joy, of that golden cup of abomina|tion, which the harlot pre&s;ents, if you &s;ip, man, of feeling, you will "drain the chalice to the lowe&s;t and foule&s;t dregs."

<HEAD>MATERNAL ARTIFICE. A TRUE STORY.</HEAD>
<P>TWO young gentlemen of fa&s;hion and fortune, &s;tudents of law, &s;ome years ago rented an el|egant double &s;et of chambers, and lived together in Gray's-Inn. The apartments were on the ground floor, and the windows looked into and had an ea|&s;y communication with the charming garden belong|ing to that ancient &s;eminary. One Sunday morn|ing, being at breakfa&s;t, with the window open, they ob&s;erved a very beautiful young woman in the gar|den, with a child in her arms equally beautiful: &s;he pa&s;&s;ed them &s;everal times, &s;edate and unob&s;erving, but at length her attractions becoming too irre&s;i&s;ti|ble, they &s;poke to her, and with much earne&s;tne&s;s invited her to partake of their breakfa&s;t. The beau|tiful <HI>nur&s;ery maid,</HI> however, was inflexible; &s;he re|&s;i&s;ted all intreaties, and in &s;ome time retired. For the whole day nothing el&s;e was thought of but her, and a thou&s;and &s;chemes devi&s;ed to entrap her into the chambers.</P>

<HEAD>The Morris-Town Gho&s;t DELINEATED.</HEAD>
<P>A DIABOLICAL intrigue invaded the county of <HI>Morris,</HI> in the &s;tate of <HI>New Jer&s;ey,</HI> in the year 1788. This unequalled performance, has taken vent and is promulgated througout the continent, and de|&s;erves the attention of every per&s;on. But before I proceed any further, I think it requi&s;ite to advert a few minutes to the general character of that place.</P>
<P>It is very con&s;picuous that many of the people in that county, are much attached to machinations, and will &s;pend much time in inve&s;tigating curio&s;ities. I don't &s;ay whether &s;uch a turn of mind is to be imputed to indigence or owing to the operation of the climate: this I &s;ubmit to the candor of every per&s;on to deter|mine within him&s;elf&mdash;it is obvious to all who are acquainted with the county of Morris, that the pheno|mena and capricious notions of witchcraft, has engaged the attention of many of its inhabitants for a number of years, and the exi&s;tence of witches is adopted by the generality of the people.</P>
<P>I was once in Morri&s;town, and happened to be in conver&s;ation with &s;ome gentlemen, who had, as it were, the faith of a&s;&s;urance it witchcraft. They informed me that there were &s;everal young women who were be|witched; and they had been harra&s;ed &s;o much by witches for a long time, and all their experiments proved abortive, and the young women were &s;o much debilitated they were fearful they would never recover their healths. They related &s;everal occurrences, that I think too &s;imple to mention; but one in&s;tance was, "That an old lady was churning, and being much fatigued, and unable to obtain butter, &s;he at la&s;t con|cluded that the witches were in the churn, and imme|diately
<PB N="8" REF="034482_0046_0FFDE7C0F9AFDA50">
had recour&s;e to experiments, which were, that of heating &s;everal hor&s;e-&s;h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">es, and putting them into the churn alternately&mdash;&s;he burnt the devil out, and immediately obtained butter."</P>
<P>I perceived that the generality were apprehen&s;ive of witches riding them, and the greate&s;t evidence of a witch was, if a woman had any deformity, or had lived to that age to cau&s;e wrinkles in her face, &s;he had the appella<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ion of a witch. There was another occurrence that happened on Sunday. They informed me, a man was driving his &s;heep from his grain, and an accident happened as they were jumping ove<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> a fence, one of the &s;heep broke its leg. The man for &s;ome time before &s;uppo&s;ed that the &s;ame &s;heep was bewitched. About the &s;ame time, an aged old lady returning from church, her hor&s;e unfortunately &s;tumbled, &s;he fell to the ground and broke her leg&mdash;This was received as an indication that &s;he was a witch: And in fact, if a hor&s;e had the belly-ache, or any bea&s;t was in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">gony of pain and be|haved uncommon, the general opinion was, that the crea|ture was bewitched.</P>
<P>It is my opinion, that per&s;ons actuated by &s;uch ca|pricious notions, are pre-di&s;po&s;ed for the reception of marvelous curio&s;ities whenever they occur.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now proceed to detail as near as po&s;&s;ible, re|lative to the tran&s;actions of that phenomena, <HI>Legerde|main</HI> and <HI>Hobgoblins,</HI> that happened in Morri&s;town, in the year 1788.</P>
<P>This tran&s;action has occupied the attention of many&punc; &amp; cau&s;ed great wondering through the &s;tate, and every per&s;on is eager to acqu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">re a thorough knowledge of the real tran&s;actions; and I hope this will have a tendency to eradicate &s;uch capricious notions from every ration|al mind&mdash;The chief conductor of this deception, was <HI>Ransford Rogers,</HI> a native of Connecticut, in New-England. He was an illiterate per&s;on, but very aff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|ble, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a genius adequate to prepo&s;&s;e&s;s him&s;elf into favor with many, and great facility to di&s;play his abilities with the geate&s;t brilliancy.

thence to the &s;tate of New-York. His place of re&s;i|dence, before he came to New Jer&s;ey, was Smith's Clove, where he taught a &s;chool. During his re&s;idence at Smith's Clove, two gentlemen from the county of Morris, who had been long in &s;earch and digging of mines, but had always proved un&s;ucce&s;sful for the want of a per|&s;on who&s;e knowledge de&s;cended into the bowels of the earth, and could reveal the &s;ecret things of dark|ne&s;s. There was al&s;o, a prevailing opinion, that there was money depo&s;ited in the bowels of the earth, at Schooler's mountain, with an enchantment upon it&mdash; that it could not be obtained without a peculiar art in legerdemain, or to di&s;pel the hobgoblins &amp; apparitions. The&s;e gentlemen, in pur&s;uit of a man that could work miracles, accidentally found Rogers, and after a &s;hort conver&s;ation, made known their bu&s;ine&s;s to him, and concluded that he was the man every way calculated to their wi&s;hes, for he was very fond of giving hints of his exten&s;ive knowledge in every art and &s;cience, but careful not to go &s;o far as to demon&s;trate his pro|po&s;itions. He had a pretended copious knowledge in chemi&s;try; and could rai&s;e or di&s;pel good or evil &s;pirits. He then agreed with tho&s;e gentlemen to &s;upply them with whatever was reque&s;ted&mdash;This was a noble man indeed! Now they concluded the man was found who could &s;upply them with all things; and one who was endowed with power and &s;agacity not to be exceeded by finite wi&s;dom!</P>
<P>But altho' Rogers had engaged to exhibit miracles, knowing that he mu&s;t &s;eek inventions, he thinking it too great <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n undertaking, began to regret, fearing that he was not able to perform: but after he had underta|ken, and given hints of his knowledge and abilities, and being &s;olicited by the gentlemen to proceed, he could not elude what he had advanced, but re&s;olved to have recour&s;e to experiments and &s;tratagem to prove his a&s;&s;ertions. He was then &s;olicited to remove to Morri&s;town. Tho&s;e gentlemen, with indifatigable pains, procured him a &s;chool, three miles from Morri&s;|town. This was &s;atisfactory to Rogers being confi|dent of their integrity, and perceiving their flexibility

and readine&s;s to admini&s;ter to his relief, he thinking him&s;elf happy with &s;uch noble concomitants, left Smith's Clove, with the greate&s;t alacrity, and took his ab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">de about three miles from Morri&s;town, where he pre&s;ided over a common Engli&s;h &s;chool.

He then finding him&s;elf deficient, and perceiving it requi&s;ite to have an a&s;&s;i&s;tant in order to carry on nocturnal performances, with the greate&s;t &s;ecrecy. He then obtained leave of his em|ployers, to ab&s;ent him&s;elf a few days and return to New England for his family and &s;ome other bu&s;ine&s;s, upon his promi&s;e to return as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>While he was in New-England, he contracted with a per&s;on, a &s;choolma&s;ter, to return with him, in&s;uring him a &s;chool that would be very lucrative.&mdash;Rogers, agree<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ble to his promi&s;e, was as brief as po&s;&s;ible, and returned with his new companion to Morri&s;town, where he was &s;aluted by per&s;ons of eminence and congratula|ted by many after his long ab&s;ence.

<P>Rogers, after gathering information from every quar|ter, and hearing the ob&s;tructions that debarred them from obtaining immen&s;e riches, was now &s;atisfied this was the time for him to fulfil his former a&s;&s;ertions.</P>

<P>The&s;e gentlemen now under apprehen&s;ions of va&s;t riches, began to propagate their intentions to particu|lar friends, and there was &s;uch a pro&s;pect of being rich, that many were anxious to become members; and ad|ditions were added unto it daily, of &s;uch as expected great riches.

<P>Now you will ob&s;erve, that it is highly nece&s;&s;ary, that Rogers would have a&s;&s;ociates, in order to facilitate his manoeuvres and avoid detection.

<P>Upon one part of the circle was erected four po&s;ts, in order to &s;pread a cloth, and form a tent, where Ro|gers could pre&s;ide, as governor of the gha&s;tly proce&s;&s;ion.

This therefore had a tendency to continue the bu&s;ine&s;s thro' the winter, as it was almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible for &s;ome of them to get &s;ilver or gold; but all of them were very

indu&s;trious &s;eeking the &s;um required. They would give almo&s;t any di&s;count or intere&s;t that any man plea&s;ed to a&s;k. They would mortgage their farms and di&s;po&s;e of their cattle at half price, rather than fail in obtaining the required &s;um.</P>
<P>It is very obvious why Rogers and his a&s;&s;ociates, the &s;uppo&s;ed &s;pirits, reque&s;ted &s;ilver or gold, for they wanted to carry it out of the &s;tate, and paper money would have been of but little &s;ervice.</P>
<P>Sometime in March, the money being chiefly de|po&s;i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed in the hands of the &s;pirits. Rogers fearing that &s;omething might happen, pretended to have nocturnal interviews with the &s;pirit, likewi&s;e &s;everal per&s;ons, e&s;pecially tho&s;e who had the mo&s;t faith and men of veracity were called out of thei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> beds in the night by the &s;pirits, and directed how to proceed.</P>
<P>The&s;e gentlemen immediately made known to the company their interviews with the &s;pirit; and when the company were convened in a private room&punc; the pretended &s;pirits were out &s;ide of the hou&s;e, gr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">aning, gingling of money, telling them to have faith, be of good cheer, and keep &s;ecret all tran&s;actions, and in May next they &s;hould receive the trea&s;ure.&mdash;This was in March 1789. They all returned with joy, fear and wondering, being very liberal, waiting impatiently for May to come.</P>
<P>Now Rogers and his a&s;&s;ociates have received the greater part of the money, and they are full of machi|nations, how they &s;hall po&s;tpone the bu&s;ine&s;s the next meeting, for all expected to proceed to Schooler's Mountain the next May, and receive the trea&s;ure.</P>
<P>The night appointed being now arrived, they all convened in a large circle in an open field, waiting for the gho&s;ts to appear and give them farther directions, and proceed with them to the place where the money was depo&s;ited. Immediately the gho&s;ts appeared with|out the circle, with great choler, and hedious groanings, wreathing them&s;elves in various po&s;itions, that appeared mo&s;t gha&s;tly in the night&mdash;then upbraiding the company declaring they had not proceeded regular, and &s;ome

of them was faithle&s;s, and had devulged many things that ought to have been kept &s;ecret; and by their wicked di&s;po&s;itions and animo&s;ities that had taken place among them, debarred them at pre&s;ent, from obtaining the trea&s;ures. The pretended gho&s;ts, raging to that degree at the mi&s;conduct of the company, that Rogers, who appeared or pretended to be very much frightened with the re&s;t, with all his art and pleading was &s;carcely able to pacify the raging gho&s;ts!</P>
<P>At this the company confiding in Rogers, looked to him for protection.

<P>They now returned from the circle, &s;till retaining their belief, reve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing and adhering to Rogers in all things. Thus far they have been &s;educed. They have given their money to Rogers and his a&s;&s;ociates, in&s;tead of apparitions; and are waiting for the &s;pirit to return and lead them to anticipated fortunes.</P>
<P>Had Rogers now halted, and not proceeded upon another project, he would have been feared and re&s;pect|ed; &amp; the capricious notions of witchcraft, hobgoblins, and the devil would have prevailed among them, with prejudice, fear and ignorance, until this day. But this diabolical intrigue and the &s;ucceeding one, has d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ffu&s;ed light, and eradicated ignorance from the minds of many. This &s;cene ended the fir&s;t of May, 1789.</P>
<P>It is evident that Rogers did not intend to proceed any further upon &s;uch diabolical intrigues; but &s;ome|time in the fall preceding the termination of the fir&s;t &s;cene, two young men from New England, took up their abode in the county of Morris: Some time the fore part of the winter, one of them took up his abode in Morris.

They all returned to the hou&s;e, ob&s;erving the greate&s;t order, trembling at every noi&s;e and gazing in every direction; &s;uppo&s;ing they were &s;urrounded by hob|goblins, apparitions, witches and the devil. Rogers and two of his a&s;&s;ociates pretended to give up the money which was only blank paper.</P>
<P>This pretended &s;pirit was one of the a&s;&s;ociates with a white &s;heet around him, and a machine over his mouth that his voice might not be de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">cted by any that knew him; and immediately after the &s;pirit had depo&s;ited his money, this &s;pirit takes it to him&s;elf, which was about forty pounds.</P>
<P>Previous to this, Rogers pulverized &s;ome bones and had given it to the commander, declaring that it was the du&s;t of their bodies, and each man mu&s;t have &s;ome of this powder in a paper &s;ealed, as a token of the &s;pirits approbation, &amp; that he was one of the company. This powder was to be kept &s;ecret, and no one to touch it upon his peril. A &s;ufficient quantity of liquor was al&s;o prepared, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e &s;pirit had ordered to be u&s;ed very freely; then each one taking a hearty dram, they all united in fervent prayer, after which the meeting was concluded.</P>
<P>It is very obvious that &s;piritous liquors, when taken in large q<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ntities, will augm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> the ideas of men and induce them to anticipate profit and plea&s;ure, although they are inacce&s;&s;ible in futurity.&mdash;Some of the

<P>Thus they proceeded as above mentioned, in giv|ing their money to the &s;pirit every few evenings.&mdash; The &s;pirits brought to the commander &s;everal curio|&s;ities, that were to be exhibited to the company in order to confirm their faith, but were to be delivered to the &s;pirits whenever they called for them.</P>
<P>Various ceremonies were performed that I &s;hall omit as they are too &s;imple to mention, but every means were taken in order to make the members u&s;e liquor freely, the &s;pirits gave unto the command|er a compounded ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s that was to be made into pills, and each one to take a pill at every meeting, and except he u&s;ed ve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y freely of liquor it would operate in making his mouth and lips &s;well; thus they cau&s;ed &s;ome to drink to exc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;s through fear, although they before ob&s;erved the greate&s;t tempe|rance, and in fact &s;ome drank to that degree, to ob|viate the effects of the pill, that they were almo&s;t in|capable of navigating in the night.</P>
<P>Thus the company had increa&s;ed to about thirty-&s;even in number; and the greater part had given the money to the &s;p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rits and circum&s;tances prevent|ed or delayed the re&s;t from doing it, although every one was as bri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> as p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;&s;ible and &s;pared no pains to procure the money.</P>

<PB N="25" REF="034482_0054_0FFDE7D7C32F8570">
was to be kept &s;ecret and no one to touch it. This man, leaving it accidently in his pocket one day in the hou&s;e, his wife happened to find it, broke it open and perceiving the contents, feared to touch it &s;uppo&s;ing it to be witchcraft: She went immediate<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y to the prie&s;t for advice&mdash;He, not knowing i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> compo&s;ition was un|willing to touch it for fear it might have &s;ome ope|ration upon him.</P>
<P>When her hu&s;band di&s;covered what &s;he had done, he was much terrified, declaring that &s;he had ruined him forever, in breaking open that paper. This made her more &s;olicitous to know the contents; and &s;he de|claring not to devulge any thing, he told her the whole of their proceedings; &s;he in&s;i&s;ted on it, they were &s;erv|ing the devil, and thought it her duty, to put an end to &s;uch proceedings. This made great di&s;turbance in the company, and Rogers and his a&s;&s;ociates were in di&s;gui&s;e every night, appearing to particular per&s;ons as &s;pirits, in order to confirm them in the faith and prevent a di&s;covery. At la&s;t one evening Rogers having drank too much of the good creature, taking a &s;heet with him rode to a hou&s;e of a certain gentleman in order to conver&s;e with him at a &s;pirit; but making many blunders the woman thought it was a man, but after conver&s;ing with him &s;ome time, and going to prayer, Rogers departed declaring&punc; that he was the &s;pirit of a ju&s;t man.</P>
<P>In the morning as &s;oon as it was light, the man went out where the &s;pirit appeared, and as there had been a heavy dew that night, he perceived the tracks of a man, and following him &s;ome di&s;tance to the fence where he perceived a hor&s;e had been tied; he then tracking the hor&s;e to the door where Rogers lived&mdash;But as Rogers was not within, he followed the &s;ame track to the hou&s;e of a certain gentleman, about half a mile di&s;tant, where he found Rogers; and as the gentleman of the hou&s;e had, the evening before, lent Rogers a hor&s;e, together with many other circum&s;tan|ces, &s;ufficient to convict him. The authority was
<PB N="26" REF="034482_0055_0FFDE7DB9F3E69C0">
then con&s;ulted, and judging him culpable, he was im|mediately apprehended and committed to pri&s;on.</P>
<P>This detection greatly alarmed the whole company, as they were unwilling to believe that Rogers was the &s;pirit, even when the cleare&s;t evidence demon&s;trated the fact, but Rogers declaring his innocence, was in a few days bailed out, by a gentleman that I &s;hall call by the name of compa&s;&s;ion, and to this gentleman Rogers ought ever to pay a debt of gratitude and benevolence.</P>
<P>After Rogers was clear of the gaol, he perceived he was among his enemies, he therefore made his flight, but being pur&s;ued and apprehended the &s;econd time, he confe&s;&s;ed his faults, and owned that for his conduct and the expre&s;&s;ions he had u&s;ed in his projects, he de|&s;erved puni&s;hment; but fortune favored him, and he once more eluded their hands.</P>
<P>Now many threatenings and horrid imprecations proceed from many after this man, who only a few days before, they revered and thought him a &s;uperior being.</P>
<P>The cau&s;e of the&s;e imprecations being ca&s;t after him is very obvious, that is while he continued with them in parables, working miracles, he promi&s;ed them va&s;t riches, but now he is gone, their hopes are all eradicated. But ought not the county of M&mdash; to perpetuate and honor the name of Rogers for eradicating ignorance and cau&s;ing the light of rea&s;on to illume the minds of many, where ob&s;curity had reigned for many years?</P>
<P>There have been various reports propagated con|cerning the &s;um that Rogers and his a&s;&s;ociates ob|tained from the believers of witchcraft, but the whole amount was about five hundred pounds. But after Rogers had taken the veil from their eyes, and extracted money from their pockets, they were unwil|ling that he &s;hould have any compen&s;ation, but in&s;i&s;t|ed that he &s;hould be brought to condign puni&s;hment, therefore Rogers is detected in his knavery, and his a&s;&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ciates are unknown to the world; but had Rogers per&s;evered, and avoided detection until all had given
<PB N="27" REF="034482_0055_0FFDE7DB9F3E69C0">
in their money, he would have left them in ignorance waiting with patience, for the return of the &s;pirit, as was the ca&s;e with the former company; but his being detected, and confe&s;&s;ion, demon&s;trated to every per&s;on that there was neither witchcraft nor black art in any of his performances, which they thought to proceed from &s;upernatural power. I am confident that this occurrence is &s;ufficient to exterpate all capri|cious notions of witchcraft, wizzards, hobgoblins, ap|paritions and frightful imaginations from the minde of rational beings.</P>
<P>I am confident that there are many &s;uch kinds of impo&s;itions tran&s;acted by particular per&s;ons, and many illiterate and vulgar readily believe that they have power &s;ufficient to call into being the &s;ouls of tho&s;e dead bodies that have long &s;lept dorment in the earth&punc; But let rea&s;on be our guide, and we &s;hall &s;oon exclaim again&s;t &s;uch capricious declarations&mdash;But one half of the world will not inve&s;tigate whether the&s;e things are either probable or po&s;&s;ible, but proceed with alacri|ty, upon the affirmation of others. Again, there are &s;ome, that are as de&s;titute of hone&s;ty as the devil is of holine&s;s, and will per&s;evere in hopes of gain, and will gra&s;p at every opportunity to take advantage, but when they are outwitted, they will exclaim again&s;t knavey and plead innocence.</P>
<P>It is obvious to every per&s;on that it is among the mo&s;t vulgar and illiterate part of the world, where the capricious notions of witchcraft and hobgoblins re&s;ide. But in tho&s;e parts of the world where learning and &s;cience has prevailed, every idea or preten&s;ion towards rai&s;ing demons are excluded. The Laplanders the mo&s;t ignorant beings on earth, pretend to work miracles, rai&s;e, demons, and predict future events, and many with weak intellects and tremulous readily adhere to their fanta&s;tical declarations; but nature is uniform in her cour&s;e, and deviates not, and when &s;uch wonderful phaenomena pre&s;ents, as I have been treating of, we m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y rea&s;onably expect that is the production and craft of vicious per&s;ons, to &s;upport their indolence.

<DIV2 TYPE="speech">
<HEAD>Mr. Er&s;kine's Speech on the part of the Pro&s;ecution:</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>GENTLEMEN OF THE JURY,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE charge of bla&s;phemy, which is put upon the record again&s;t the printer of this publication, is not an accu&s;ation of the &s;ervants of the crown, but comes before you &s;anctioned by the oaths of a grand jury of the country. It &s;tood for trial upon a for|mer day; but it happening, as it frequently does, without any imputation upon the gentlemen named in the pannel, that a &s;ufficient number did not appear to con&s;titute a full &s;pecial jury, I thought it my duty to withdraw the cau&s;e from trial, till I could have the opportunity which is now open to me of addre&s;|&s;ing my&s;elf to you, who were originally appointed to try it. I pur&s;ued this cour&s;e, however, from no jealou&s;y of the common juries appointed by the laws for the ordinary &s;ervice of the court, &s;ince my whole life has been one continued experience of their virtues; but becau&s;e I thought it of great im|portance, that tho&s;e who were to decide upon a cau&s;e &s;o very momentous to the public, &s;hould have the highe&s;t po&s;&s;ible qualifications for the deci&s;ion. That they &s;hould not only be men capable from their educations of forming an enlightened judgment, but
<PB N="4" REF="034482_0058_0FFDE7E31EB3FC40">
that their &s;ituations &s;hould be &s;uch as to bring them within the full view of their enlightened coun|try, to which in character and in e&s;timation, they were in their own turns to be re&s;pon&s;ible.</P>
<P>Not having the honour, gentlemen, to be &s;worn for the king as one of his coun&s;el, it has fallen much oftener to my lot to defend indictments for libels, than to a&s;&s;i&s;t in the pro&s;ecution of them. But I feel no embarra&s;&s;ment from that recollection; &s;ince I &s;hall not be found to-day to expre&s;s a &s;entiment, or to utter an expre&s;&s;ion incon&s;i&s;tent with tho&s;e inva|luable principles for which I have uniformly con|tended in the defence of others. Nothing that I have ever &s;aid, either profe&s;&s;ionally or per&s;onally for the Liberty of the Pre&s;s, do I mean to-day to contrad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ct or counteract. On the contrary, I de&s;ire to preface the very &s;hort di&s;cour&s;e I have to make, with reminding you, that it is your mo&s;t &s;olemn duty to take care that it &s;uffers no injury in your hands. A free and unlicen&s;ed pre&s;s <HI>(in the ju&s;t and legal &s;en&s;e of the expre&s;&s;ion)</HI> has led to all the ble&s;&s;ings both of religion and government, which Great Britain or any part of the world at this moment enjoys, and is calculated &s;till farther to ad|vance mankind to higher degrees of civilization and happine&s;s. But this freedom, like every other, mu&s;t be limited to be enjoyed, and like every human ad|vantage, may be defeated by its abu&s;e.</P>
<P>Gentlemen! the defendant &s;tands indicted for having publi&s;hed this book, which I have only read from the obligations of profe&s;&s;ionly duty, and which I aro&s;e from the reading of with a&s;toni&s;hment and di&s;gu&s;t. Standing here with all the privileges be|longing to the highe&s;t coun&s;el for the crown, I &s;hall be entitled to reply to any defence that &s;hall be made for the publication. I &s;hall wait with patience till I hear it. Indeed, if I were to anticipate the defence which I hear and read of, it would be defaming by
<PB N="5" REF="034482_0058_0FFDE7E31EB3FC40">
anticipation, the learned coun&s;el who is to make it. For if I am to collect it, even from a formal notice given to the pro&s;ecutors in the cour&s;e of the pro|ceedings, I have to expect, that in&s;tead of a de|fence conducted according to the rules and princi|ples of Engli&s;h law and ju&s;tice, the foundation of all our laws, and the &s;anctions of all our ju&s;tice, are to be &s;truck at and in&s;ulted. What is the force of that juri&s;diction which enables the court to &s;it in judgment? What but the oath which his lord&s;hip, as well as your&s;elves, have &s;worn upon the go&s;pel to fulfil. Yet in the king's court, where his maje&s;|ty is him&s;elf al&s;o &s;worn to admini&s;ter the ju&s;tice of England&mdash;in the king's court&mdash;which receives its high authority under a &s;olemn oath to maintain the chri&s;tian religion, as it is promulgated by God in the Holy Scriptures, I am neverthele&s;s called upon as coun&s;el for the pro&s;ecution to produce a certain book de&s;cribed in the indictment to be the Holy Bible. No man de&s;erves to be upon the rolls of the court, who dares, as an attorney, to put his name to &s;uch a notice. It is an in&s;ult to the authority and dignity of the court of which he is an officer; &s;ince it &s;eems to call in que&s;tion the very foundation of its juri&s;diction. If this is to be the &s;pirit and temper of the defence; if, as I collect from that ar|ray of books which are &s;pread upon the benches be|hind me, this publication is to be vindicated by an attack of all the truths which the chri&s;tian religion promulgates to mankind, let it be remembered that &s;uch an argument was neither &s;ugge&s;ted nor ju&s;ti|fied by any thing &s;aid by me on the part of the pro|&s;acution. <HI>In this &s;tage of the proceedings,</HI> I &s;hall call for reverence to the Sacred Scr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ptures, not from their merits, unbounded as they are, but from their authority in a chri&s;tian country&mdash;not from the obli|gations of con&s;cience, but from the rules of law.

devoted to the truths of Chri&s;tianity, and my firm belief in the Holy Go&s;pel is by no means owing to the prejudices of education, (though I was religiou&s;|ly educated by the be&s;t of parents) but ari&s;es from the fulle&s;t and mo&s;t continued reflections of my ri|per years and under&s;tanding. It forms at this mo|ment the great con&s;olation of a life, which, as a &s;hadow, mu&s;t pa&s;s away; and without it, indeed&punc; I &s;hould con&s;ider my long cour&s;e of health and pro&s;|perity (perhaps too long and too uninterrupted to be good for any man) only as the du&s;t which the wind &s;catters, and rather as a &s;nare than as a ble&s;&s;ing.&mdash; Much, however, as I wi&s;h to &s;upport the authority of Scripture from a rea&s;oned con&s;ideration of it, I &s;hall repre&s;s that &s;ubject for the pre&s;ent.

The &s;ame principles, which vindicate civil conten|tions hone&s;tly directed, extend their protection to the &s;harpe&s;t controver&s;ies on religious faiths. This rational and legal cour&s;e of improvement, was re|cognized and ratified by Lord Kenyon, as the law of England, in a late trial at Guildhall, when he look|ed back with gratitude to the labors of the reform|ers, as the fountains of our religious emancipation, and of the civil ble&s;&s;ings that followed in their train. The Engli&s;h con&s;titution, indeed, does not &s;top &s;hort in the toleration of religious opinions, but li|berally extends it to practice. It permits every man, <HI>even publicly,</HI> to wor&s;hip God according to his own con&s;cience, though in marked di&s;&s;ent from the national e&s;tabli&s;hment, &s;o as he profe&s;&s;es the general faith, which is the &s;anction of all our moral duties, and the only pledge of our &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the &s;y&s;tem which con&s;titutes a &s;tate. Is not this &s;y&s;tem of free|dom of controver&s;y, and freedom of wor&s;hip, &s;uf|ficient for all the purpo&s;es of human happine&s;s and improvement? And can it be nece&s;&s;ary for either, that the law &s;hould hold out indemnity to tho&s;e who wholly abjure and revile the government of their country, or the religion on which it re&s;ts for its foundation? I expect to hear, in an&s;wer to what I am now &s;aying, much that will offend me. My learned friend, from the difficulties of his &s;ituation, which I know, from experience, how to feel for very &s;incerely, may be driven to advance propo&s;i|tions which it may be my duty, with much freedom, to reply to; and the law will &s;anction that freedom. But will not the ends of ju&s;tice be completely an|&s;wered by that right, to point out the errors of his di&s;cour&s;e in terms that are decent and calculated to expo&s;e its defects; or will any arguments &s;uffer, or will public ju&s;tice be impeded, becau&s;e neither pri|vate honor and ju&s;tice, nor public decorum, would induce my telling my learned friend, that he was a

fool, a liar, and &s;coundrel in the face of the court, becau&s;e I differed from him in argument or opin|ion? This is ju&s;t the di&s;tinction between a book of free legal controver&s;y, and the book which I am arraigning before you. Every man has a legal right to inve&s;tigate, with mode&s;ty and decency, contro|ver&s;ial points of the chri&s;tian religion; but no man, con&s;i&s;tently with a law, which only exi&s;ts under its &s;anctions, has a right, not only broadly to deny its very exi&s;tence, but to pour forth a &s;hocking and in&s;ulting invective, which the lowe&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hments, in the gradations of civil authority, ought not to be permitted to &s;uffer, and which &s;oon would be borne down by in&s;olence and di&s;obedience, if they did.</P>
<P>The &s;ame principle pervades the whole &s;y&s;tem of the law, not merely in its ab&s;tract theory, but in its daily and mo&s;t applauded practice. The inter|cour&s;e between the &s;exes and which, properly regu|lated, not only contiues but humanizes and adorns our natures, is the foundation of all the thou&s;and romances, plays, and novels, which are in the hands of every body. Some of them lead to the confirma|tion of every virtuous principle; others though with the &s;ame profe&s;&s;ion, addre&s;s the imagination in a manner to lead the pa&s;&s;ions into dangerous exce&s;&s;es. But though the law does not nicely di&s;criminate the various &s;hades which di&s;tingui&s;h the&s;e works from one another, &s;o as that it &s;uffers many to pa&s;s through its liberal &s;pirit, that upon principle might be &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, would it, or does it tolerate, or does any decent man contend that it ought to pa&s;s by unpuni&s;hed, libels of the mo&s;t &s;hamele&s;s ob&s;cenity, manife&s;tly pointed to debauch innocence, and to bla&s;t and poi&s;on the morals of the ri&s;ing generation? This is only another illu&s;tration to demon&s;trate the obvious di&s;tinction between the work of an author, who fairly exerci&s;es the powers of his mind, in inve&s;ti|gating doctrinal points in the religion of any country,
<PB N="10" REF="034482_0061_0FFDE7EB77047518">

How any man can rationally vin|dicate the publication of &s;uch a book, in a country where the Chri&s;tian Religion is the very foundation of the law of the land, I am totally at a lo&s;s to con|ceive, and have no ideas for the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of!

Upon what principle is it even offered to the court, who&s;e authority is contemned and mocked at? If the religion propo|&s;ed to be called in que&s;tion, is not previou&s;ly adopt|ed in belief and &s;olemnly acted upon, what authori|ty has the court to pa&s;s any judgment at all of acquit|tal or condemnation? Why am I now, or upon any other occa&s;ion, to &s;ubmit to your Lord&s;hip's author|ity?

The whole judi|cial fabric from the king's &s;overeign authority to the lowe&s;t office of magi&s;tracy, has no other foundation.

&s;hall attend their ob&s;ervances, and the awful pun|i&s;hments which &s;hall await upon their tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions. But it &s;eems, this is an age of rea&s;on, and the time and per&s;on are at la&s;t arrived, that are to di&s;&s;ipate the errors which have over&s;pread the pa&s;t genera|tions of ignorance. The believers in Chri&s;tianity are many, but it belongs to the few that are wi&s;e to correct their credulity. Belief is an act of rea&s;on, and &s;uperior rea&s;on may, therefore, dictate to the weak. In running the mind along the long li&s;t of &s;incere and devout Chri&s;tians, I cannot help lament|ing, that Newton had not lived to this day, to have had his <HI>&s;hallowne&s;s</HI> filled up with this <HI>new flood</HI> of <HI>light.</HI>&mdash;But the &s;ubject is too awful for irony. I will &s;peak plainly and directly. Newton was a Chri&s;tian&mdash;Newton, who&s;e mind bur&s;t forth from the fetters ca&s;t by nature upon our finite concep|tions&mdash;Newton who&s;e &s;cience was truth, and the foundation of who&s;e knowledge of it was philo&s;o|phy. Not tho&s;e vi&s;ionary and arrogant pre&s;ump|tions which too often u&s;urp its name, but philo&s;ophy re&s;ting upon the ba&s;is of mathematics, which, like figures, cannot lie. Newton, who carried the line and rule to the uttermo&s;t barriers of creation, and explored the principles by which, no doubt, all cre|ated matter is held together and exi&s;ts. But this extraordinary man, in the mighty reach of his mind, overlooked, perhaps, the errors, which a minuter inve&s;tigation of the created things on this earth might have taught him, of the e&s;&s;ence of his Creator. What &s;hall then be &s;aid of the great Mr. Boyle, who locked into the Organic &s;tructure of all matter, even to the brute inanimate &s;ub&s;tances, which the foot treads on. Such a man may be &s;uppo&s;ed to have been equally qualified with Mr. Paine to look up through nature to nature's God. Yet the re&s;ult of all his contemplation was the mo&s;t confirmed and devout belief in all which the other holds in con|tempt,
<PB N="13" REF="034482_0062_0FFDE7F034DE0AD8">
as de&s;picable and driveling &s;uper&s;tition.&mdash; But this error might, perhaps, ari&s;e from a want of due attention to the foundations of human judgment and the &s;tructure of that under&s;tanding which God has given us for the inve&s;tigation of truth&mdash;Let that que&s;tion be an&s;wered by Mr. Locke, who was, to the highe&s;t pitch of devotion and adoration, a Chri&s;|tian. Mr. Locke, who&s;e office was to detect the errors of thinking, by going up to the fountains of thought, and to direct into the proper track of rea|&s;oning, the devious mind of man, by &s;hewing him its whole proce&s;s, from the fir&s;t perceptions of &s;en&s;e to the la&s;t conclu&s;ions of ratiocination, putting a rein be&s;ides upon fal&s;e opinion, by practical rules for the conduct of human judgment. But the&s;e men were only deep thinkers, and lived in their clo|&s;ets, unaccu&s;tomed to the traffic of the world, and to the laws which practically regulate mankind.</P>
<P>Gentlemen! in the place where we now &s;it to admini&s;ter the ju&s;tice of this great country, above a century ago, the never to be forgotten Sir Matthew Hale pre&s;ided; who&s;e faith in chri&s;tianity is an ex|alted commentary upon its truth and rea&s;on, and who&s;e life was a glorious example of its fruits in man, admini&s;tering human ju&s;tice with wi&s;dom and purity drawn from the pure fountain of the chri&s;tian di&s;|pen&s;ation, which has been, and will be, in all ages, a &s;ubject of the highe&s;t reverence and admiration. But it is &s;aid by the author, that the chri&s;tian fable is but the tale of the more ancient &s;uper&s;titions of the world, and may be ea&s;ily detected by a proper under&s;tanding of the mythologies of the heathens. Did Milton under&s;tand tho&s;e Mythologies? Was <HI>he</HI> le&s;s ver&s;ed than Mr. Paine in the &s;uper&s;titions of the world? No, they were the &s;ubject of his im|mortal &s;ong; and though &s;hut out from all recur|rence to them, he poured them forth from the &s;tores of a memory rich with all that man ever knew,
<PB N="14" REF="034482_0063_0FFDE7F3010496F0">
and laid them in their order as the illu&s;tration of that real and exalted faith, the unque&s;tionable &s;ource of that fervid genius, which ca&s;t a &s;ort of &s;hade up|on all the other works of man&mdash;

But it was the light of the BODY only that was ex|tingui&s;hed; "The cele&s;tial light &s;hone inward, and enabled him to ju&s;tify the ways of God to man." The re&s;ult of his thinking was neverthele&s;s not the &s;ame as the author's. The my&s;terious incarnation of our Ble&s;&s;ed Saviour (which this work bla&s;phemes in words &s;o wholly unfit for the mouth of a Chri&s;|tian, or for the ear of a court of ju&s;tice, that I dare not, and will not, give them utterance) Milton made the grand conclu&s;ion of the <HI>Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t,</HI> the re&s;t from his fini&s;hed labors and the ultimate hope, expectation, and glory of the world.</P>

<PB N="16" REF="034482_0064_0FFDE7F6E2B4EEF8">
affects me very deeply. The author of this book has written largely on public liberty and govern|ment; and this la&s;t performance has, on that ac|count, been more widely circulated, and principally among tho&s;e who attached them&s;elves from principle to his former works. This circum&s;tance renders a public attack <HI>upon all revealed religion</HI> from &s;uch a writer, infinitely more dangerous. The religious and moral &s;en&s;e of the people of Great-Britain, is the great anchor which alone can hold the ve&s;&s;el of the &s;tate amid&s;t the &s;torms which agitate the world; and if I could believe for a moment, that the ma&s;s of the people were to be debauched from the prin|ciples of religion, which form the true ba&s;is of that humanity, charity, and benevolence, that has been &s;o long the national characteri&s;tic, in&s;tead of mixing my&s;elf, as I &s;ometimes have done, in political refor|mations, I would rather retire to the uttermo&s;t cor|ners of the earth to avoid their agitation; and would bear, not only the imperfections and abu&s;es com|plained of in our own wi&s;e e&s;tabli&s;hment, but even the wor&s;t government that ever exi&s;ted in the world, rather than go to the work of reformation with a multitude &s;et free from all the charities of chri&s;tiani|ty, who had no &s;en&s;e of God's exi&s;tence, but from Mr. Paine's ob&s;ervation of nature, which the ma&s;s of mankind have no lei&s;ure to contemplate; nor any belief of future rewards and puni&s;hments to animate the good in the glorious pur&s;uit of human happi|ne&s;s, or to deter the wicked from de&s;troying it even in its birth. But I know the people of England bet|ter. They are a religious people, and with the ble&s;&s;ing of God, as far as it is in my power, I will lend my aid to keep them &s;o. I have no objections to the free&s;t and mo&s;t extended di&s;cu&s;&s;ions upon doc|trinel points of the chri&s;tian religion, and <HI>though the law of England does not permit it,</HI> I do not dread the rea&s;oned arguments of Dei&s;ts again&s;t the exi&s;tence

An intellec|tual book, however erroneous, addre&s;&s;ed to the in|tellectual world upon &s;o profound and complicated a &s;ubject, can never work the mi&s;chief which this in|dictment is calculated to repre&s;s.&mdash;Such works will only employ the minds of men enlightened by &s;tudy, to a deeper inve&s;tigation of a &s;ubject well worthy of their deepe&s;t and continued contemplation.

The changes produced by &s;uch reciprocations of lights and intelligences are certain in their progre&s;&s;ions, and make their way imperceptably, as conviction comes upon the world, by the final and irre&s;i&s;tible power of truth. If chri&s;tianity be founded in fal&s;e|hood, let us become Dei&s;ts in this manner, and I am contented. But this book has no &s;uch object, and no &s;uch capacity: it pre&s;ents no arguments to the wi&s;e and enlightened. On the contrary, it treats the faith and opinions of the wi&s;e&s;t with the mo&s;t &s;hocking contempt, and &s;tirs up men, without the ad|vantages of learning, or &s;ober thinking, to a total di&s;belief of every <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hing hitherto held &s;acred; and con&s;equently to a rejection of all the laws and ordi|nances of the &s;tate, which &s;tand only upon the a&s;&s;ump|tion of their truth.</P>

<P>A Mr. Fleming, one of the Clerks of the Bank, was the only witne&s;s called on the part of the pro&s;e|cution. He &s;aid, he purcha&s;ed the book in que&s;tion, of the defendant, at his &s;hop, on the 7th of Februa|ry la&s;t.</P>
<P>The Notice which Mr. Er&s;kine mentioned in his &s;peech was here read, and Mr. John Martin, the attorney for the defendant, readily admitted that he had &s;ent it to tho&s;e who were concerned for the pro|&s;ecution.</P>
<P>Mr. Kyd made a very learned and ingenious &s;peech for the defendant. He &s;aid he would endea|vor to di&s;charge the important duty which he ow|ed to his client, in a manner, that was con&s;i&s;tent with the dignity of that court, and with that decency and &s;olemnity which, he felt, belonged to the &s;ubject. The que&s;tion was, whether the author, when he wrote this book, felt as he wrote, and expre&s;&s;ed him|&s;elf as he felt. He humbly &s;ubmitted, that the in|ferences which Mr. Paine had drawn from the pre|mi&s;es, were &s;uch as he might have drawn with a fair and hone&s;t intention. Whether tho&s;e inferen|ces were ju&s;t or not, was totally a different que&s;|tion.

But, if his lord&s;hip and the gentlemen of the jury could di&s;cover no wicked or malicious intent, they would not puni&s;h a man for a mere error in judgment. If the jury could collect no wicked in|tention in the author from reading the whole of this performance, he contended he was completely pro|tected under the right which he and every other man had to exerci&s;e the powers of his mind in di&s;|cu&s;&s;ing any controver&s;ial points of religion. Suppo|&s;ing then the book had been written innocently, he might infer, as a general propo&s;ition, that it was al|&s;o publi&s;hed with an innocent intention. At the &s;ame time he admitted, that what was &s;o written, might be publi&s;hed from a malicious motive, for which the publi&s;her would be amenable to the laws of his country. The learned council next &s;elected &s;everal pa&s;&s;ages from this performance, to &s;hew, that the author felt the mo&s;t profound reverence and veneration for the &s;upreme being, and denied the truth of revelation only becau&s;e he could not re|concile it to the character and attributes of the Deity. It was &s;tated in that publication, that the law of na|ture was engraven on every man's heart, and that he might clearly collect the knowledge of that duty which he owed to his creator from a contemplation of his works. Mr. Kyd next endeavored to ju&s;tify the charges made upon the Bible by the author, by a variety of pa&s;&s;ages which he &s;elected, but which, at the de&s;ire of his lord&s;hip and the jury, he did not read, but only referred to them, and contended, that if tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ages were found in any other book, they would be con&s;idered as indecent and immoral. He appealed to the writings of Dr. Lairdner, Dr. Bentley, and other eminent divines in &s;upport of the right of free di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, upon all &s;ubjects of a controver&s;ial nature. He then &s;poke in &s;evere terms of this pro&s;ecution, which he &s;aid, would ne|ver have been in&s;tituted, had it not been for Bi&s;hop

Wat&s;on's Apology, which had been very widely circulated, and had excited a curio&s;ity to read the book, to which it was an an&s;wer; and to gratify that public curio&s;ity, it was that this book, which, he believed, had been fir&s;t publi&s;hed at Paris, was afterwards publi&s;hed in this country. Mr. Kyd in|&s;i&s;ted, at a great length, upon the freedom of enqui|ry, and a free pre&s;s, and gave the reformation and revolution as two in&s;tances of the ine&s;timable ble&s;|&s;ings which had re&s;ulted from them to this country.</P>
<P>Mr. Er&s;kine made a mo&s;t eloquent reply. He &s;aid, he was bound, in re&s;pect to his learned friend, as a member of a mo&s;t honorable profe&s;&s;ion, to &s;up|po&s;e, that he was placed in a very irk&s;ome &s;ituation, to be called for on a defence &s;o exceedingly difficult to make and &s;o extremely delicate to manage, with|out violating that common decency that was due to a court of ju&s;tice. He could not therefore help con|&s;idering him as entitled to a con&s;iderable degree of indulgence. Mr. Er&s;kine here adverted to &s;everal of the pa&s;&s;ages &s;elected from the Old Te&s;tament by Mr. Kyd, and explained the rea&s;on of the introduc|tion into the &s;acred writings. The hi&s;tory of man, he &s;aid, was the hi&s;tory of man's vices and pa&s;&s;ions, which could not be cen&s;ured without adverting to their exi&s;tence, and many of the in&s;tances that had been referred to were recorded as memorable warn|ings and examples for the in&s;truction of mankind.&mdash; Mr. E. next entered mo&s;t forcibly and deeply into the evidences of chri&s;tianity, particularly tho&s;e that were founded on that &s;tupendous &s;cheme of prophe|cy, which formed one of the mo&s;t unan&s;werable ar|guments for the truth of the chri&s;tian religion.&mdash; "It was not," he &s;aid, the purpo&s;e of God to de|&s;troy free agency by overpowering the human mind with the irre&s;i&s;table light, and conviction of revela|tion, but to leave men to collect its truths, as they were gradually illu&s;trated in the accompli&s;h|ment

of the divine promi&s;es of the go&s;pel. Bred as he was to the con&s;ideration of evidence, he declared he con&s;idered the prophecy concerning the de&s;truc|tion of the Jewi&s;h nation, if there was nothing el&s;e to &s;upport chri&s;tianity, ab&s;olutely irre&s;i&s;table. The divi&s;ion of the Jews into tribes, to pre&s;erve the gen|ealogy of Chri&s;t, the di&s;tinction of the tribe of Ju|dah, from which he was to come; the lo&s;s of this di&s;tinction when that end was accompli&s;hed; the predicted departure of the &s;ceptre from I&s;rael; the de&s;truction of the temple of Jeru&s;alem, which im|perial munificence in vain attempted to re-build to di&s;grace the prophecy; the di&s;per&s;ion of this na|tion over the face of the whole earth, the &s;preading of the go&s;pel throughout the world; the per&s;ecution of its true mini&s;ters, and the foretold &s;uper&s;titions which for ages had defiled its wor&s;hip&mdash;the&s;e were topics upon which Mr. Er&s;kine expatiated with great eloquence, and produced a mo&s;t powerful effect on every part of the audience. He concluded with a vindication of the authors of this pro&s;ecution. He &s;aid, they were men of the highe&s;t character and greate&s;t con&s;ideration in the country. Many of them were charged with the offices of religion, others of them were cloathed with the robes of magi&s;tracy; mo&s;t of them were men of deep learn|ing and thinking; and all of them ju&s;tly entitled to the thanks of the public for their noble exertions in the cau&s;e of religion and virtue.</P>

<P>Being now in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all the facts of this ea&s;e, and convinced, in my own mind, what conclu|&s;ion ought to be drawn from them, I am not &s;ure, that it is nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay any thing at all to you up|on the &s;ubject. Gentlemen, before you proceed to decide on the merits of this, or any other cau&s;e, it is

proper to &s;ee whether the parties litigating &s;tand in a fair light before you. I was extremely hurt when the learned Coun&s;el for the defendant thought fit to &s;tate to you, with very con&s;iderable empha&s;is, and a very determined tone of voice, that this was a &s;candalous pro&s;ecution. I cannot help wi&s;hing that this &s;entence had not been uttered.&mdash;Who commenced this pro&s;ecution, I certainly know not. But from what fell from the very learn|ed Coun&s;el who ju&s;t &s;at down, I am inclined to &s;up|po&s;e it proceeded from a &s;ociety of gentlemen in&s;ti|tuted for the mo&s;t important of all purpo&s;es, for pre&s;erving the morals of the people; a &s;ociety com|po&s;ed of Clergymen, and Laymen of the mo&s;t re|&s;pectable characters in the kingdom, who, feeling how the country is overrun with profligacy and wickedne&s;s, which boldly rai&s;e their heads in defi|ance of the law of the land, were determined to &s;ee whether, in the fir&s;t place, by admonition and ad|vice, they could not &s;top the torrent of vice and im|morality; and &s;econdly, if that &s;hould fail, to try what could be done by puni&s;hment. If people with the very be&s;t intentions carry on pro&s;ecutions that are oppre&s;&s;ive, the end may not always perhaps &s;anctify the means. But the manner in which this pro&s;ecution has been conducted, is certainly not oppre&s;&s;ive; for in&s;tead of proceeding in the more expen&s;ive mode, the pro&s;ecutors went before a Grand Jury of the country: and it was nece&s;&s;ary to obtain the opinion of that Grand Jury before the party could be put in proce&s;s.&mdash;Gentlemen! we &s;it here in a Chri&s;tian A&s;&s;embly to admini&s;ter the laws of the land, and I am to take my knowledge of what the law is from that which has been &s;anc|tioned by a great variety of legal deci&s;ion. I am bound to &s;tate to you, what my predece&s;&s;ors in Mr. Wool&s;ton's ca&s;e (2 Strange, 834) &s;tated half a century ago, in this Court of which I
<PB N="23" REF="034482_0067_0FFDE7FE3AFC8E30">
am an humble member, namely, that the chri&s;tian religion is part of the law of the land. Chri&s;tianity from its earlie&s;t in&s;titution met with its oppo&s;ers. Its profe&s;&s;ors were very &s;oon called upon to publi&s;h their apologies for the doctrines they had embraced. In what manner they did that, &amp; whether they had the advantage of their adver&s;aries, or &s;unk under the &s;u|periority of their arguments mankind for near two thou&s;and years have had an opportunity of judging. They have &s;een that Julian, Ju&s;tin Martyr, and o|ther apologi&s;ts have written, and have been of opin|ion the argument was in favour of tho&s;e very publi|cations. The world has lately been favoured with another apology from a mo&s;t learned and re&s;pecta|ble prelate, who calls his work <HI>An Apology for the Chri&s;tian Religion.</HI> I &s;hall not decide between the merits of the one and the other. The publications them&s;elves are in the hands of the world: and I &s;incerely wi&s;h in the concluding language of the work to which I have ju&s;t referred (I do not affect to u&s;e the very words) I &s;incerely wi&s;h that the author of the work in que&s;tion may become a partaker of that faith in revealed religion, which he has &s;o gro&s;s|ly defamed, and may be enabled to make his peace with God for that di&s;order which he has endea|voured to the utmo&s;t of his power to introduce into &s;ociety. We have heard to-day, that the light of Nature, and the contemplation of the works of cre|ation are &s;ufficient, without any other revelation of the Divine Will. Socrates, Plato, Xenophon, Tul|ly&mdash;each of them in their turns profe&s;&s;ed they want|ed other lights; and knowing and confe&s;&s;ing that God was good, they took it for granted that the time would come when he would impart a farther revelation of his will to mankind. Though they walked as it were through a cloud, darkly, they hop|ed their po&s;terity would almo&s;t &s;ee God face to face. &mdash;This condition of mankind has met with repre|hen&s;ion

to-day. But I &s;hall not pur&s;ue this argu|ment. Fully impre&s;&s;ed with the great truths of re|ligion, which, thank God, I was taught in my ear|ly years to believe, and of which the hour of reflec|tion and inquiry, in&s;tead of producing any doubt has fully confirmed me in. I expected the learned Coun&s;el for the Defendant would have differed the ca&s;e of the publi&s;her from that of the author of this work; that he would have endeavored to convince you that whatever guilt might belong to the author, nothing was imputable to the publi&s;her. He has, however to my utter &s;urpri&s;e, exactly rever&s;ed the ca&s;e. He tells you it was originally publi&s;hed at Paris in 1794; that the feelings of the author's friends were wounded by this work, which I call a nefarious publication, and that it was in a great mea&s;ure forgotten; and you are now called upon to judge of the merits or demerits of the publi&s;her, who has brought forth a &s;till-born work, forgotten by every body, till he ventured in defiance of the verdicts of mankind on the author's political works to &s;end it forth among the inhabitants of this coun|try. Unle&s;s it was for the mo&s;t malignant purpo&s;es, I cannot conceive how it was publi&s;hed. It is how|ever for you to judge of it, and to do ju&s;tice between the public and the defendant."</P>

<P>THIS au&s;picious day, my fellow citizens, is the epoch from which we date our national exi&s;te<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ce; it ranks fir&s;t in our American calander.

the fir&s;t in the annals of time, which gave to a kind equal rights and equal privileges&mdash;How &s;triking the contra&s;t! the one &s;inks and degrades, the other exalts and ennobles the human charact|er&mdash;How augu&s;t the contemplation! that through the various changes and national revolutions which the hi&s;toric page unfolds, this &s;hould be the fir&s;t p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">d of time, when in truth and reality man became re-inve&s;ted with that equal liberty, which the God of nature gave him.

The principles on which it was defended and &s;upported&mdash;the di&s;tingui&s;hed rank it takes among the other revo|lutions of the earth, and the conduct of its brave defenders in the days of danger and di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>A Briti&s;h political writer ob&s;erves, that the
<Q>American war originated in parliamentary job|bing, and its great purpo&s;e was to transfer enormous ma&s;&s;es of Engli&s;h property into loans, funds and taxes, to form that corrupt mini&s;te|rial phalanx called the friends of government; while this faction, like a malignant di&s;ea&s;e, was
<PB N="9" REF="034482_0071_0FFDE80BE986BCC0">
draining the vital &s;ub&s;tances of Britain, and even armies and navies were meerly its ramifi|cations.</Q></P>
<P>If this repre&s;entation of the cau&s;e of the Ame|rican war be true, and &s;uch a faction, or &s;uch a parliament, could obtain &s;uch an a&s;cendency in Britain as to draw forth the vital &s;ub&s;tances of that nation to effect &s;uch purpo&s;es, how awfully wretched mu&s;t have been our &s;ituation and cir|cum&s;tances had they been enabled to rear and e&s;tabli&s;h the &s;tandard of corruption on our Ame|rican &s;hores&mdash;in&s;tead of rejoicing this day, we &s;hould have been mourning&mdash;in&s;tead of celebrat|ing the triumphs of freedom, we &s;hould have been langui&s;hing in the &s;hackles of de&s;poti&s;m.</P>
<P>The frequent repre&s;entations which were made in England of the wealth of the Americans by the Briti&s;h officers, who had &s;erved here again&s;t the French, and who had fared &s;umptuou&s;ly at the American tables, rou&s;ed into action the contemp|lations which had long been entertained by the government, to rai&s;e a revenue in America.</P>
<P>Early in 1764, the que&s;tion of right to tax was brought forward in the hou&s;e of commons, and &s;o &s;trong was the impul&s;e of avarice, and &s;uch the
<PB N="10" REF="034482_0072_0FFDE80EC8246190">
influence which a corrupt admini&s;tration had ac|quired at this period, that not a per&s;on in the hou&s;e ventured to controvert the right. After|wards however, many illu&s;trious characters came forward in the oppo&s;ition; and the names of tho&s;e who&s;e motives were pure and uncorrupt will ever brighten and adorn the page of Ameri|can freedom. They improved us in the knowledge of our political rights, and confirmed us in the &s;up|port of them. The fir&s;t, the foremo&s;t, and I may add, the mo&s;t &s;incere, was the celebrated Colonel Barre, for who&s;e noble defence of virtue, and America, in oppo&s;ition to the whole hou&s;e; "May recorded honors gather round his monument and thicken over him."</P>
<P>Sub&s;equent to the revolution of 1688, the mo&s;t prominent features in the Briti&s;h &s;y&s;tem of politics was "That taxation could only re&s;ult from repre|&s;entation," or, in other words, that the property of the &s;ubject could never be taken without his con&s;ent. But the influence of corruption and the anxiety to draw re&s;ources from America to &s;up|port its &s;ooted &s;tream, in all its branches, from the king on the throne down to the lowe&s;t mini&s;terial hireling, had opperated &s;uch an entire dereliction of principles, that when the que&s;tion of right, as
<PB N="11" REF="034482_0072_0FFDE80EC8246190">
before ob&s;erved, fir&s;t came forward, there was not an advocate in its favor; and they con&s;idered the future oppo&s;ition as merely the petulance of di&s;content and not the voice of rea&s;on.</P>
<P>From hence, my fellow citizens, we have this in&s;tructive le&s;&s;on, never to permit a departure from a political principle of freedom, known, e&s;|tabli&s;hed and felt to be right&mdash;it augurs corruption in the government, and will never be attempted from motives pure and virtuous.</P>
<P>To &s;upply the priviledged and pampered orders of &s;tate, the heart of poverty in Britain had been probed, from every quarter, for many years, and for new &s;ources they turned their baleful eyes acro&s;s the atlantic.</P>
<P>America was &s;een like a fair flower ri&s;ing in the wilderne&s;s, untouched and unblighted by the breath of corruption. The hierarchy of that country ever clo&s;ely united with the mini&s;try and with hands equally impure, as anxiou&s;ly de&s;ired to gra&s;p and enjoy the flower&mdash;it was as &s;trongly inculcated that the e&s;tabli&s;hment and &s;upport of a Bi&s;hopric in America, with its de&s;irable append|ages, was as e&s;&s;ential to the &s;upport and pre&s;erva|tion of the mother church, as the obtaining a

revenue was e&s;&s;ential to the &s;upport of the &s;tate&punc; Thus united with the&s;e views and the&s;e de&s;ires, they commenced the operation from whence re|&s;ulted the glorious revolution which we this day celebrate.</P>
<P>But let us turn, my countrymen, from that bar|ren wa&s;te "in which no &s;alutary plant takes root, no verdure quickens," to a &s;oil, as I willingly be|lieve, pure as the limped &s;tream, and fertile in every great and good qualification.</P>
<P>It is the ob&s;ervation of an elegant writer, "That the Americans, di&s;per&s;ed throughout an immen&s;e continent, free as the wilds of nature which &s;urrounded them; amid&s;t their rocks, their mountains, the va&s;t plains of their de&s;erts, on the confines of tho&s;e fore&s;ts, in which all is &s;till in its &s;a|vage &s;tate, and where there are no traces of either the &s;lavery or the tyranny of man; &s;eemed to re|ceive from every natural object a le&s;&s;on of liberty and independence&mdash;as far removed from riches as from poverty, they were not corrupted either by the exce&s;s of luxury or the exce&s;s of want. Feed us with food convenient for us, le&s;t we be full and deny thee, and &s;ay, who is the Lord, or le&s;t we be poor and &s;teal and take the name of our God in vain," was their united prayer.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="034482_0073_0FFDE8106D8C89A8">From this natural equality in which man is more jealous of his rights than perhaps in any other &s;tate of &s;ociety, flowed a greater effu&s;ion of knowledge than falls to the lot of mankind in ge|neral, as they better under&s;tood their rights, &s;o were they more ready to repel every unju&s;t inva|&s;ion of them.</P>
<P>The principle, that repre&s;entation and taxation mu&s;t go together, was well under&s;tood in America; there were comparatively few, &s;o illiterate, but knew it to be a political axiom; none &s;o in&s;en&s;ible but felt it as their only &s;ecurity again&s;t the gra&s;p of oppre&s;&s;ion&mdash;this principle individuals in Ame|rica oppo&s;ed in their public prints to the repeated attempts making in Britain to bring forward bills to tax them; and illu&s;trated it with a &s;trength of argument that &s;unk beneath contempt the vile and &s;lavi&s;h yell of the minions of de&s;poti&s;m, that all oppo&s;ition to government was rebellion, and re|bellion trea&s;on.</P>
<P>The plan however progre&s;&s;ed in Britain, and when matured, was brought into action; it was like putting fire to the train; the noble &s;entiment of <HI>Freedom or Death</HI> &s;pread quick as the electric flame from one extreme of our continent to the other, and rou&s;ed, as it were, in&s;tantaneou&s;ly, three millions of people in &s;upport of their right.</P>

And to the honor of our country would it be, could we in truth pa&s;s this eulogium from the Congre&s;s of '75 to every &s;ub&s;equent Congre&s;s of America.

<P>To &s;how to you, my countrymen, the character of the&s;e our youthful politicians in the mind of the un|prejudiced in Europe; permit me to repeat the lan|guage of the fir&s;t &s;tate&s;man and orator of Britain: "The repre&s;entatives of America (&s;aid he) meet with the &s;entiments and temper, and &s;peak the &s;en&s;e of the continent. For genuine &s;agacity, for &s;ingular moderation, for &s;olid wi&s;dom, manly &s;pi|rit, &s;ublime &s;entiments and &s;implicity of language, for every thing re&s;pectable and honorable, the Congre&s;s of Philadelphia &s;hine unrivalled. They are viewed as the northern con&s;tellation of glori|ous worthies illuminating and warming the New World." The&s;e eulogiums re&s;ulted from that

<P>But let us pa&s;s to a comparative view of this our glorious revolution, with the other revoluti|ons of the earth, having <HI>Liberty</HI> for their object. In one re&s;pect, my countrymen, there is a di&s;tin|gui&s;hing difference which gives lu&s;tre to the Ame|rican character. The revolution of this country proceeded from a well dige&s;ted knowledge of civil rights, the re&s;ult of philo&s;ophical reflection, and &s;peculative enquiry. The other revolutions, which have preceded it, have been cau&s;ed either by a &s;eries of oppre&s;&s;ions which could no longer be endured, or have &s;prung from the impul&s;e of the moment, occa&s;ioned by &s;ome unexpected and vio|lent act of de&s;poti&s;m that tortured human nature into action&mdash;the one pourtrays the rea&s;on and reflection of man, the other the limits of his pati|ence,

and the keenne&s;s of his &s;en&s;ations. The Romans, &s;o celebrated in hi&s;tory for their patrio|tic virtues, were rou&s;ed from &s;lavery to freedom by the &s;ight of the poignard reeking with the blood of the virtuous Lucretia.</P>
<P>The death of the cha&s;te Virginia, by the hand of her father to &s;ave her honor from the tyrannic Decimvir, and her body expo&s;ed to the public view, impelled that people again to revolt and to annihilate the order of the Decimvirs, which had violated the rights of the Roman citizens.</P>
<P>And to come down to more modern times&mdash;the introduction of the inqui&s;ition into the Nether|lands by the de&s;potic Philip,&mdash;The terrible &s;pec|tacles daily pre&s;ented by that awful in&s;titution of men peri&s;hing in the flames on account of their religion; and the ignomineous death of Egmont and Horn, two popular favorites, at length tor|tured the people into that oppo&s;ition which, even|tually, i&s;&s;ued in the emancipation of the &s;even united provinces. Even the hardy robu&s;t inha|bitants of the Alps, &s;ince &s;o famous for the Hel|vetic confederacy, for a long time, bore the mo&s;t degrading oppre&s;&s;ions until the manly virtues of a TELL excited them to re&s;i&s;tance.

for the magnitude of its object, and the tran&s;|cendant brilliancy of execution, an exception; tho&s;e heroic and unconquerable republicans had borne the hard hand of de&s;poti&s;m, till forced by its oppre&s;&s;ive weight to avenge their wrongs.</P>
<P>The guardian genius of America, on the con|trary, would never permit the fangs of de&s;poti&s;m to fa&s;ten on our hallowed &s;oil. And may it fore|ver be our great characteri&s;tic to fore&s;ee danger at a di&s;tance, and to repel its approach on principle and rational enquiry.</P>
<P>Where are the liberties of the republics which have preceded us; except the Swis Cantons&punc; I know of no republican &s;tate at this day but has returned to the dark glooms of de&s;poti&s;m, and the name of <HI>Republic</HI> and <HI>Liberty</HI> is, with them, meer &s;ounding bra&s;s and tinkling cimbal. The cau&s;e of this awful relap&s;e from freedom to &s;lavery is well worth the enquiry of every American. And the great &s;ource from whence it has proceeded, my countrymen, is the want of general in&s;truction and information among the people. This forms an un&s;urmountable barrier again&s;t their inve&s;tigat|ing their political rights, renders them inattentive thereto, and obliges them to intru&s;t the &s;acred depo&s;it in the hands of a few individuals, who&s;e

conduct they are unable to &s;crutinize, and &s;ubjects them to be carried away credulous victims to the artifice of every de&s;igning demagogue.</P>
<P>But it is time we turn to a &s;ummary con&s;ideration of the conduct of the brave defenders of our coun|try in its days of danger and di&s;tre&s;s. "And what hand withholds the lawrel &s;o ju&s;tly due to the virtues of our patriotic warriors," called from the peaceful walks of private life by their coun|try's danger&mdash;from citizens they became &s;oldiers. What hard&s;hips, incident to that &s;ituation, for &s;e|ven long years did they not endure? Where is the example in hi&s;tory of equal gallantry and per|&s;everance in every difficulty and danger un&s;upplied and unpaid, owing to the impoveri&s;hed &s;tate of their country. In the dark &s;ea&s;ons of the war when the genius of liberty &s;eemed to langui&s;h un|der the pre&s;&s;ure of de&s;poti&s;m, and many of her &s;ons, in moments of de&s;pondency, &s;ought protec|tion from the relentle&s;s foe; who &s;aw the army di&s;cover &s;imptoms of de&s;pair, or heard from them the language of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion?</P>
<P>Permit me here, my fellow citizens, to pay the tribute of prai&s;e to the patriotic &s;oldier who con|tinued on the banks of the D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">leware, with their illu&s;trious commander, after the expiration of their

enli&s;tments, and with whom he was enabled to recro&s;s that river &amp; turn the tide of the war by his victories at Trenton and at Princeton. But why do I particularize? Scarcely a town in our coun|try but where have been di&s;played acts which &s;ound their panegyric&mdash;when the cau&s;e of free|dom was finally triumphant, and the minions of de&s;poti&s;m obliged to withdraw from its &s;hores, which they had &s;o long &s;tained with the blood of its citizens, the&s;e patriotic warriors gave to the world an example of the love of country ever to be admired and imitated. Un&s;atisfied and unre|quited for their long laborious toils and &s;ervices, the moment their country cea&s;ed to call, they for|&s;ook the in&s;ignia of <HI>War</HI> for the mantle of <HI>Peace,</HI> and returned to the bo&s;om of that country who&s;e rights they had &s;o nobly defended.</P>
<P>And here they have pur&s;ued the various occu|pations of civil life with an indu&s;try which di&s;tin|gui&s;hes them in &s;ociety; and at this day are, al|mo&s;t unexceptionably, con&s;picuous examples of attachment to the <HI>Rights of Man</HI> and the cau&s;e of <HI>Liberty</HI> in general, in oppo&s;ition to all arbitrary power&mdash;&s;entiments that were &s;o &s;trongly impre&s;|&s;ed in the cour&s;e of their illu&s;trious &s;ervice.

merit, is the only compen&s;ation they can now receive. The&s;e will never be withheld while gratitude is an American virtue; and when time &s;hall cea&s;e with them and us, let their monumenal in&s;cription be "HE FOUGHT AND CON|QUERED IN HIS COUNTRY's CAUSE." It will &s;erve both for Epitaph and Elegy, and en|dear their memory with po&s;terity.</P>
<P>The brilliant exploits of the militia of our country ought never, on an occa&s;ion like this, to be pa&s;&s;ed over in &s;ilence. They have ever been con&s;idered as the grand defence of every land of freedom, and in the cour&s;e of our &s;truggle for in|dependence, they proved them&s;elves eminently worthy of the &s;acred charge. The &s;cenes of Bunker's hill, of Bennington and the Sarratoga heights, will &s;tand to the late&s;t time, illu&s;trious examples of their prowes and intripidity. But to enumerate all the glorious deeds of our warring yeomanry would require time far beyond my pre|&s;ent limits. Permit me only to add, that the mi|litia of New-Jer&s;ey acquired lawrels which will ever be con&s;picuous in the volums of American hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>I will not lead you on this occa&s;ion to the tombs of our illu&s;trious warriors who fell in their coun|try's

cau&s;e&mdash;it would touch the &s;prings of grief in the heart of &s;en&s;ibility, and draw the &s;ympathetic tear from many an eye. The renumeration of their names without the annexation of their &s;hin|ing virtues, would be too melancholy a detail&mdash; and to give to each his characteri&s;tic glory is the plea&s;ing ta&s;k of the hi&s;torian. The memory of every &s;on and daughter of liberty will embalm them as long as time and recollection &s;hall exi&s;t.</P>
<P>And now permit me to clo&s;e this addre&s;s, my countrymen, in reminding you that the pre&s;erva|tion of that liberty, which you have &s;o gloriou&s;ly obtained, depends on your own knowledge and the right in&s;truction and education of your chil|dren; for you and they can only be thereby en|abled to guard the avenues to the temple of free|dom, from the fir&s;t approaches of tyranny, and to detect both oppre&s;&s;ion and anarchy, which are equal evils in all their variety of &s;hapes&mdash;guard with anxious care your pre&s;ent free and glorious Con&s;titution, and afford at all times your ready exertions to &s;upport it in its purity again&s;t either its de&s;troyer or corrupter; for by either its de&s;|truction or corruption you loo&s;e your all; <HI>in vain you fought&mdash;in vain you conquered.</HI></P>
