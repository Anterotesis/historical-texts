<P>The two following narratives were tran&s;mitted for pub|lication in September la&s;t, but &s;hortly afterwards the letter from &s;ir Guy Carleton to his excellency general Wa&s;hington, informing that the &s;avages had receiv|ed orders to de&s;i&s;t from their incur&s;ions, gave rea&s;on to hope that there would be an end to their barbari|ties. For this rea&s;on it was not thought nece&s;&s;ary to hold up to view what they had heretofore done. But as they &s;till continue their murders on our frontiers, the&s;e narratives may be &s;ervicable to induce our go|vernments to take &s;ome effectual &s;teps to cha&s;ti&s;e and repre&s;s them; as from hence they will &s;ee that the na|ture of an Indian is fierce and cruel, and that an ex|tirpation of them would be u&s;eful to the world, and honourable to tho&s;e who can effect it.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Mr. BAILEY,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>Enclo&s;ed are two narratives; one of Dr. Knight, who acted as &s;urgeon in the expedition under col. Craw|ford; the other of John Slover: That of Dr. Knight was written by him&s;elf at my reque&s;t; that of Slover was taken down by my&s;elf from his mouth as he re|lated it. The man from his early and long captivi|ty, among&s;t the Indians, though perfectly &s;en&s;ible and intelligent, yet cannot write. The character of Dr. Knight is well known to to be that of a good man, of great veracity, of a calm and deliberate mind, and u&s;ing no exaggeration in his account of any matter. As a te&s;timony in favour of the veracity of Slover, I thought proper to procure a certificate from the clergyman to who&s;e church he belongs, and which is as follows:</P>
<P>"I DO hereby certify that John Slover has been for many years a regular member of the church under my care, and is worthy of the highe&s;t credit, WILLIAM RENO."</P>
<P>The&s;e narratives you will plea&s;e to publi&s;h in your u&s;e|ful paper or in any other way you may judge proper. I conceive the publication of them may an&s;wer a good end in &s;howing America, what have been the &s;uffer|ings of &s;ome of her citizens by the hands of the In|dian allies of Britain. To the&s;e narratives I have &s;ubjoined &s;ome ob&s;ervations which you may publi&s;h or omit as it may be convenient.</P>

<HEAD>Dr. KNIGHT'S Narrative.</HEAD>
<P>ABOUT the latter end of the month of March or the beginning of April, of the pre&s;ent year, the we&s;tern Indians began to make incur&s;ions upon the frontiers of Ohio, Wa&s;hington, Youghagany, and We&s;t|moreland counties, which has been their con&s;tant prac|tice ever &s;ince the commencement of the pre&s;ent war between the United States and Great Britain.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of the&s;e predatory inva&s;ions the prin|cipal officers of the abovementioned counties, namely, colonels William&s;on and Mar&s;hall, tried every method in their power to &s;et on foot an expedition again&s;t the Wyandot towns, which they could effect no other way than by giving all po&s;&s;ible encouragement to volun|teers. The plan propo&s;ed was as follows: Every man furni&s;hing him&s;elf with a hor&s;e, a gun, and one months provi&s;ion, &s;hould be exempted from two tours of mili|tia duty. Likewi&s;e, that every one who had been plun|dured by the Indians, &s;hould, if the plunder could be found at their towns, have it again, proving it to be his property: and all hor&s;es lo&s;t on the expedition by unavoidable accident were to be replaced by hor&s;es taken in the enemy's country.</P>
<P>The time appointed for the rendezvous, or general meeting of the volunteers, was fixed to be on the 20th of May, and the place, the old Mingoe town on the we&s;t &s;ide of the river Ohio, about forty miles below Fort Pitt by land, and I think about 75 by water.</P>
<P>Col. Crawford was &s;olicited by the general voice of the&s;e we&s;tern counties and di&s;tricts to command the ex|pedition. He accordingly &s;et out as a volunteer and came to Fort Pitt two days before the time appointed for the a&s;&s;embling of the men. As there was no &s;ur|geon yet appointed to go with the expedition, colonel Crawford begged the favour of gen. Irvine to permit me to accompany him, (my con&s;ent having been previ|ou&s;ly
<PB N="5" REF="017993_0004_0FA412C135602F40">
a&s;ked) to which the general agreed provided col. Gib&s;on did not object.</P>
<P>Having obtained permi&s;&s;ion of the colonel I left Fort Pitt on Tue&s;day, May 1&s;t, and the next day about one in the afternoon arrived at the Mingoe bottom. The volunteers had not all cro&s;&s;ed the river until Friday morning the 24th, they then di&s;tributed them&s;elves into eighteen companies, choo&s;ing their captains by vote. There were cho&s;en, al&s;o, one col commandant, four field and one brigade major. There were four hundred and &s;ixty five who voted.</P>
<P>We began our march on Saturday May 25th, making almo&s;t a due we&s;t cour&s;e, and on the fourth day reached the old Moravian town, upon the river Mu&s;kingum about 60 miles from the river Ohio. Some of the men having lo&s;t their hor&s;es on the night preceding, return|ed home.</P>
<P>Tue&s;day the 28th in the evening, major Brenton and captain Bean went &s;ome di&s;tance from camp to recon|noitre: having gone about one quarter of a mile they &s;aw two indians, upon whom they fired, and then re|turned to camp. This was the fir&s;t place in which we were di&s;covered, as we under&s;tood afterwards.</P>
<P>On Thur&s;day the fourth of June, which was the e|leventh day of our march, about one o'clock we came to the &s;pot where the town of Sandu&s;ky formerly &s;tood: the inhabitants had moved 18 miles lower down the creek, nearer the lower Sandu&s;ky; but as neither our guides or any who were with us, had known any thing of their removal, we began to conjecture there were no Indian towns nearer than the lower Sandu&s;ky, which was at lea&s;t 40 miles di&s;tant.</P>
<P>However, after refre&s;hing our hor&s;es we advanced on in &s;earch of &s;ome of their &s;ettlements, but had &s;carcely got the di&s;tance of three or four miles from the old town when a number of our men expre&s;&s;ed their de&s;ire to re|turn, &s;ome of them alledging that they had only five days provi&s;ion; upon which the field officers and cap|tains, determined, in council, to proceed that afternoon and no longer. Previous to the calling of this council, a &s;mall party of light hor&s;e had been &s;ent forward to reconnoitre.</P>
<P>I &s;hall here remark, by the way, that there are a
<PB N="6" REF="017993_0005_0FA412C2B3A709A8">
great many exten&s;ive plains in that country: The woods in general grow very thin, and free from bru&s;h and underwood; &s;o that light hor&s;emen may advance a con&s;iderable di&s;tance before an army without being much expo&s;ed to the enemy.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t as the council ended, an expre&s;s returned from the above mentioned party of light hor&s;e with intelli|gence, "that they had been about three miles in front, and had &s;een a large body of Indians running towards them."&mdash;In a &s;hort time we &s;aw the re&s;t of the light hor&s;e, who joined us, and having gone one mile fur|ther met a number of Indians who had partly got po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of a piece of woods before us, whil&s;t we were in the plains, but our men alighting from their hor&s;es and ru&s;hing into the woods &s;oon obliged them to abandon that place.</P>
<P>The enemy being by this time reinforced flanked to the right, and part of them coming in our rear quickly made the action more &s;erious. The firing continued very warm on both &s;ides from four o'clock until the du&s;k of the evening, each party maintaining their ground. Next morning about &s;ix o'clock &s;ome guns were di&s;charged at the di&s;tance of two or three hundred yards, which continued till day, doing little or no exe|cution on either &s;ide.</P>
<P>The field officers then a&s;&s;embled and agreed, as the enemy were every moment increa&s;ing and we had al|ready a number wounded, to retreat that night. The whole body was to form into three lines, keeping the wounded in the center. We had four killed and twen|ty three wounded, of the latter, &s;even very dangerou&s;|ly, on which account as many biers were got ready to carry them: mo&s;t of the re&s;t were &s;lightly wounded and none &s;o bad but they could ride on hor&s;eback. After dark the officers went on the out po&s;ts and brought in all the men as expeditiou&s;ly as they could. Ju&s;t as the troops were about to form &s;everal guns were fired by the enemy, upon which &s;ome of our men &s;poke out and &s;aid, our intention was di&s;covered by the Indians who were firing alarm guns. Upon which &s;ome in front hurried off and the re&s;t immediately followed, leaving the &s;even men that were dangerou&s;ly wounded, &s;ome of whom however got off on hor&s;eback, by means of &s;ome
<PB N="7" REF="017993_0006_0FA412C2E1C61670">
good friends, who waited for, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted them.</P>
<P>We had not got a quarter of a mile from the field of action when I heard col. Crawford calling for his &s;on John Crawford, his &s;on in law major Harri&s;on, major Ro&s;e and William Crawford, his nephews, upon which I came up and told him I believed they were before us&mdash;He a&s;ked, was that the doctor?&mdash;I told him it was&mdash;he then replied, they were not in front, and begged of me not to leave him&mdash;I promi&s;ed him I would not.</P>
<P>We then waited, and continued calling for the&s;e men till the troops had pa&s;&s;ed us. The colonel told me his hor&s;e had almo&s;t given out, that he could not keep up with the troops, and wi&s;hed &s;ome of his be&s;t friends to remain with him: he then exclaimed again&s;t the militia for riding off in &s;uch an irregular manner, and leaving &s;ome of the wounded behind, contrary to his orders. Pre&s;ently there came two men riding af|ter us, one of them an old man, the other a lad: we enquired if they had &s;een any of the above per&s;ons? they an&s;wered they had not.</P>
<P>By this time there was a very hot &s;iring before us, and, as we judged, near where our main body mu&s;t have been. Our cour&s;e was then nearly &s;outh-we&s;t, but changing it, we went north about two miles, the two men remaining in company with us. Judging our&s;elves to be now out of the enemy's lines, we took a due ea&s;t cour&s;e, taking care to keep at the di&s;tance of fifteen or twenty yards apart, and directing our|&s;elves by the north &s;tar.</P>
<P>The old man often lagged behind and when this was the ca&s;e never failed to call for us to halt for him. When we were near the Sandu&s;ky Creek he fell one hundred yards behind, and bawled out, as u&s;ual, for us to halt. While we were preparing to reprimand him for making a noi&s;e, I heard an Indian halloo, as I thought one hundred and fifty yards from the man and partly behind him; after this we did not hear the man call again neither did he ever come up to us any more. It was now pa&s;t midnight, and about day break col. Crawford's and the young man's hor&s;es gave out, and they left them. We pur&s;ued our jour|ney ea&s;tward, and about two o'clock fell in with
<PB N="8" REF="017993_0007_0FA412C3A3EEFD68">
capt. Biggs who had carried lieut. A&s;hley from the field of action, who had been dangerou&s;ly wounded. We then went on about the &s;pace of an hour, when a heavy rain coming on we concluded it was be&s;t to en|camp, as we were encumbered with the wounded officer. We then barked four or five trees, made an encampment and a fire and remained there all that night. Next morning we again pro&s;ecuted our jour|ney, and having gone about three miles found a deer which had been recently killed. The meat was sliced from the bones and bundled up in the &s;kin with a tomahawk lying by it. We carried all with us and in advancing about one mile further e&s;pyed the &s;moke of a fire. We then gave the wounded officer into the charge of the young man, de&s;iring him to &s;tay behind whil&s;t the colonel, the captain, and my&s;elf, walked up as cautiou&s;ly as we could toward the fire. When we came to it, we concluded from &s;everal circum|&s;tances &s;ome of our people had encamped there the preceding night. We then went about roa&s;ting the veni&s;on, and when ju&s;t about to march ob&s;erved one of our men coming upon our tracks. He &s;eemed at fir&s;t very &s;hy, but having called to him he came up and told us he was the per&s;on who had killed the deer, but upon hearing us come up, was afraid of Indians, hid it in a thicket and made off. Upon this we gave him &s;ome bread and roa&s;ted veni&s;on, proceeded al|together on our journey and about two o'clock came upon the paths by which we had gone out. Capt. Biggs and my&s;elf did not think it &s;afe to keep the road, but the colonel &s;aid the Indians would not fol|low the troops farther than the plains, which we were then con&s;iderably pa&s;t. As the wounded officer rode capt. Biggs' hor&s;e I lent the captain mine; the colo|nel and my&s;elf went about one hundred yards in front, the captain and the wounded officer in the center, and the two young men behind. After we had travelled about one mile and a half, &s;everal In|dians &s;tarted up within fifteen or twenty &s;teps of the colonel and me. As we at fir&s;t di&s;corvered only three I immediately got behind a large black-oak, made ready my piece and rai&s;ed it up to take fight, when the colo|nel called to me twice not to fire; upon that one of
<PB N="9" REF="017993_0008_0FA412C465B3CF48">
the Indians ran up to the colonel and took him by the hand. The colonel then told me to put down my gun, which I did. At that in&s;tant one of them came up to me whom I had formerly &s;een very often, cal|led me doctor and took me by the hand. They were Delaware Indians of the Wingenim tribe. Captain Biggs fired among&s;t them but did no execution. They then told us, to call the&s;e people and make them come there, el&s;e they would go and kill them, which the colonel did, but they four got off and e&s;caped for that time. The colonel and I were then taken to the Indian camp, which was about half a mile from the place where we were captivated. On Sunday evening five Delawares who had po&s;ted them&s;elves at &s;ome di&s;tance further on the road brought back to the camp, where we lay, captain Biggs' and lieutenant A&s;hley's &s;calps, with an Indian &s;calp which captain Bigg's had taken in the field of action: they al&s;o brought in Biggs' hor&s;e and mine, they told us the two other men got away from them.</P>
<P>Monday morning the tenth of June we were parad|ed to march to Sandu&s;ky, about 33 miles di&s;tant: they had eleven pri&s;oners of us and four &s;calps, the Indians being &s;eventeen in number.</P>
<P>Col. Crawford was very de&s;irous to &s;ee a certain Simon Girty, who lived with the Indians, and was on this account permitted to go to town the &s;ame night, with two warriors to guard him, having orders at the &s;ame time to pa&s;s by the place where the col. had turned out his hor&s;e, that they might if po&s;&s;ible, find him. The re&s;t of us were taken as far as the old town which was within eight miles of the new.</P>
<P>Tue&s;day morning the 11th, col. Crawford was brought out to us on purpo&s;e to be marched in with the other pri&s;oners. I a&s;ked the colonel if he had &s;een Mr. Gir|ty?&mdash;He told me he had, and that Girty had promi&s;ed to do every thing in his power for him, but that the Indians were very much enraged again&s;t the pri&s;oners; particularly captain Pipe one of the chiefs: he likewi&s;e told me that Girty had informed him that his &s;on in law col. Harri&s;on and his nephew William Crawford, were made pri&s;oners by the Shawane&s;e, but had been pardoned. This capt. Pipe had come from the towns
<PB N="10" REF="017993_0009_0FA412C527FA3508">
about an hour before col. Crawford, and had painted all the pri&s;oners faces black.</P>
<P>As he was painting me he told me I &s;hould go to the Shawane&s;e towns and &s;ee my friends. When the colo|nel arrived he painted him black al&s;o, told him he was <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> to &s;ee him, and that he would have him &s;haved when he came to &s;ee his friends at the Wyandot town. When we marched the col. and I were kept back be|tween Pipe and Wyngenim, the two Delaware chiefs, the other nine pri&s;oners were &s;ent forward with ano|ther party of Indians. As we went along we &s;aw four of the pri&s;oners lying by the path tomahaked and &s;calped &s;ome of them were at the di&s;tance of half a mile from each other. When we arrived within half a mile of the place where the colonel was executed, we overtook the five pri&s;oners that remained alive: the In|dians had cau&s;ed them to &s;it down on the ground, as they did al&s;o the colonel and me at &s;ome di&s;tance from them I was there given in charge to an Indian fellow to be taken to the Shawane&s;e towns.</P>
<P>In the place where we were now made to &s;it down there was a number of &s;quaws and boys who &s;ell on the five pri&s;oners and tomahawk'd them. There was a certain John M^cKinly, among&s;t the pri&s;onners, former|ly an officer in the 13th Virginia regiment, who&s;e head on old &s;quaw cut off, and the Indians kicked it about upon the ground. The young indian fellows came of|ten where the colonel and I were, and da&s;hed the &s;calps in our faces. We were then conducted along toward the place where the colonel was afterwards executed: when we came within about half a mile of it Simon Gir|ty met us, with &s;everal Indians on hor&s;eback: he &s;poke to the colonel, but as I was about one hundred and fif|ty yards behind could not hear what pa&s;&s;ed between them.</P>
<P>Almo&s;t every Indian we met &s;truck us either with &s;ticks or their fi&s;ts. Girty waited till I was brought up and a&s;ked, was that the doctor?&mdash;I told him, yes, and went toward him reaching out my hand, but he bid me begone and called me a damn'd ra&s;cal, upon which the fellow who had me in charge pulled me along. Girty rode up after me and told me I was to go to the Shawa|ne&s;e towns.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="017993_0010_0FA412C63624C760">When we were come to the fire the colonel was &s;trip|ped naked, ordered to &s;it down by the fire and then they beat him with &s;ticks and their fi&s;ts. Pre&s;ently after I was treated in the &s;ame manner. They then tied a rope to the foot of a po&s;t about fifteen feet high, bound the colonel's hands behind his back and fa&s;ten|ed the rope to the ligature between his wri&s;ts. The rope was long enough either for him to &s;it down or walk round the po&s;t once or twice and return the &s;ame way. The colonel then called to Girty and a&s;ked if they in|tended to burn him?&mdash;Girty an&s;wered, yes. The co|lonel &s;aid he would take it all patiently. Upon this capt. Pipe, a Delaware chief, made a &s;peech to the In|dians, viz. about thirty or forty men, &s;ixty or &s;eventy &s;quaws and boys.</P>
<P>When the &s;peech was fini&s;hed they all yelled a hide|ous and hearty a&s;&s;ent to what had been &s;aid. The In|dian men then took up their guns and &s;hot powder into the colonel's body, from his feet as far up as his neck. I think not le&s;s than &s;eventy loads were di&s;charged upon his naked body. They then crowded about him, and to the be&s;t of my ob&s;ervation, cut off his ears: when the throng had di&s;per&s;ed a little I &s;aw the blood running from both &s;ides of his head in con&s;equence thereof.</P>
<P>The fire was about &s;ix or &s;even yards from the po&s;t to which the colonel was tied: it was made of &s;mall hickory poles, burnt quite through in the middle, each end of the poles remaining about &s;ix feet in length. Three or four Indians by turns would take up, indivi|dually, one of the&s;e burning pieces of wood and apply it to his naked body, already burnt black with the pow|der. The&s;e tormentors pre&s;ented them&s;elves on every &s;ide of him, &s;o that which ever way he ran round the po&s;t they met him with the burning faggots and poles. Some of the &s;quaws took broad boards upon which they would put a quantity of burning coals and hot embers and throw on him, &s;o that in a &s;hort time he had no|thing but coals of fire and hot a&s;hes to walk upon.</P>
<P>In the mid&s;t of the&s;e extreme tortures he called to Si|mon Girty and begged of him to &s;hoot him; but Girty making no an&s;wer he called to him again. Girty then, by way of deci&s;ion, told the colonel he had no gun, at
<PB N="12" REF="017993_0011_0FA412C6B046C7A8">
the &s;ame time turning about to an Indian who was be|hind him, laughed heartily, and by all his ge&s;tures &s;eemed delighted at the horrid &s;cene.</P>
<P>Girty then came up to me and bade me prepare for death He &s;aid, however, I was not to die at that place&punc; but to be burnt at the Shawane&s;e towns. He &s;wore by G&mdash;d I need not expect to e&s;cape death, but &s;hould &s;uffer it in all its extremities.</P>
<P>He then ob&s;erved that &s;ome pri&s;oners had given him to understand that if our people had him they would not hurt him for his part, he &s;aid, he did not believe it, but de&s;ired to know my opinion of the matter; but being at that time in great angui&s;h and di&s;tre&s;s for the torments the colonel was &s;uffering before my eyes, as well as the expectation of undergoing the &s;ame fate in two days, I made little or no an&s;wer. He expre&s;&s;ed a great deal of ill will for col. Gib&s;on, and &s;aid he was one of his greate&s;t enemies, and more to the &s;ame purpo&s;e, to all which I paid very little attention.</P>
<P>Col. Crawford at this period of his &s;ufferings be&s;ought the Almighty to have mercy on his &s;oul, &s;poke very low, and bore his torments with the mo&s;t manly forti|tude. He continued in all the extremities of pain for an hour and three quarters or two hours longer, as near as I can judge, when at la&s;t being almo&s;t &s;pent, he lay down on his belly: they then &s;calped him and repeatedly threw the &s;calp in my face, telling me "that was my great captain."&mdash;An old &s;quaw (who&s;e appear|ance every way an&s;wered the ideas people entertain of the Devil) got a board, took a parcel of coals and a&s;hes and laid them on his back and head after he had been &s;calped: he then rai&s;ed him&s;elf upon his feet and began to walk round the po&s;t: they next put a burning &s;tick to him as u&s;ual, but he &s;eemed more in&s;en&s;ible of pain than before.</P>
<P>The Indian fellow who had me in charge now took me away to capt. Pipes' hou&s;e, about three quarters of a mile from the place of the colonel's execution. I was bound all night and thus, prevented from &s;eeing the la&s;t of the horrid &s;pectacle. Next morning, being June 12th, the Indian untied me, painted me black, and we &s;et off for the Shawane&s;e town, which he told me was &s;omewhat le&s;s than forty miles from that place. We

&s;oon came to the &s;pot where the colonel had been burnt, as it was partly in our way; I &s;aw his bones laying a|mong&s;t the remains of the fire, almo&s;t burnt to a&s;hes, I &s;uppo&s;e after he was dead they had laid his body on the fire.</P>
<P>The Indian told me, that was my Big Captain and gave the &s;calp halloo. He was on hor&s;eback and drove me before him.</P>
<P>I pretended to this Indian I was ignorant of the death I was to die at the Shawane&s;e town, affected as chearful a countinance as po&s;&s;ible and a&s;ked him if we were not to live together as brothers in one hou&s;e when we &s;hould get to the town?&mdash;He &s;eemed well plea&s;ed, and &s;aid, yes. He then a&s;ked me if I could make a wigwam?&mdash;I told him, I could&mdash;he then &s;eemed more friendly &mdash;we went that day as near as I can judge about 25 miles, the cour&s;e partly &s;outhwe&s;t&mdash;The Indian told me we &s;hould next day come to the town the &s;un being in &s;uch a di|rection, pointing nearly &s;outh. At night when we went to re&s;t I attempted very often to unty my&s;elf but the Indian was extremely vigilant and &s;carce ever &s;hut his eyes that night. About day break he got up and un|tied me: he next began to mend up the fire and as the gnats were trouble&s;ome I a&s;ked him if I &s;hould make a &s;moke behind him?&mdash;he &s;aid, yes. I then took the end of a dogwood fork which had been burnt down to a|bout 18 inches long: it was the longe&s;t &s;tick I could find, yet too &s;mall for the purpo&s;e I had in view: then I pick|ed up another &s;maller &s;tick and taking a coal of fire be|tween them went behind him: then turning &s;uddenly about, I &s;truck him on the head with all the force I was ma&s;ter of; which &s;o &s;tunned him that he fell forwards with both his hands into the fire, but &s;eeing him reco|ver and get up, I &s;iezed his gun while he ran off howl|ing in a mo&s;t fearful manner&mdash;I followed him with a determination to &s;hoot him down, but pulling back the cock of the gun with too great violence I believe I broke the main &s;pring. I pur&s;ued him, however, about thirty yards &s;till endeavouring to fire the gun, but could not; then going back to the fire I took his blanket, a pair of new mokki&s;ons, his hoppes, powder horn, bullet bag, (together with the gun) and marched off, directing my cour&s;e toward the five o'clock mark about half an

hour before &s;un&s;et I came to the plains which I think are about &s;ixteen miles wide. I laid me down in a thicket till dark and then by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the north &s;tar made my way through them and got into the woods before morning. I proceeded on the next day and a|bout noon cro&s;&s;ed the paths by which our troops had gone out: the&s;e paths are nearly ea&s;t and we&s;t but I went due north all that afternoon with a view to avoid the enemy.</P>
<P>In the evening I began to be very faint, and no won|der; I had been &s;ix days pri&s;oner; the la&s;t two days of which I had eat nothing and but very little the fir&s;t three or four; there were wild goo&s;berries in abun|dance in the woods, but being unripe required ma&s;tica|tion, which at that time I was not able to perform on account of a blow received from an Indian on the jaw with the back of a tomahawk: there was a weed that grew plentifully in that place, the juice of which I knew to be grateful and nouri&s;hing; I gathered a bundle of the &s;ame, took up my lodging under a large &s;preading beech tree and having &s;ucked plentifully of the juice, went to &s;leep. Next day I made a due ea&s;t cour&s;e which I generally kept the re&s;t of my journey. I often ima|gined my gun was only wood bound and tried every method I could devi&s;e to un&s;crew the lock but never could effect it having no knife nor any thing fitting for the purpo&s;e; I had now the &s;atisfaction to find my jaw began to mend and in four or five days could chew any vegetable proper for nouri&s;hment, but finding my gun only a u&s;ele&s;s burden left her in the wilderne&s;s. I had no apparatus for making fire to &s;leep by &s;o that I could get but little re&s;t for the gnats and mu&s;ketoes; there are likewi&s;e a great many &s;wamps in the beach ridge which occa&s;ioned me very often to lie wet: this ridge through which I travelled is about 20 miles broad, the ground in general very level and rich, free from &s;hrubs and bru&s;h: there are, however, very few &s;prings, yet wells might ea&s;ily be dug in all parts of that ridge; the timber on it is very lofty, but it is no ea&s;y matter to make a &s;traight cour&s;e through the &s;ame, the mo&s;s grow|ing as high upon the &s;outh &s;ide of the trees as on the north. There are a great many white oaks, a&s;h and hickory trees that grow among the beach timber; there
<PB N="15" REF="017993_0014_0FA412CAA7FB8110">
are likewi&s;e &s;ome places on the ridge, perhaps for three or four continued miles where there is little or no beech, and in &s;uch &s;pots, black, white oak, a&s;h and hickory a|bound. Sugar trees grow there al&s;o to a very great bulk: the &s;oil is remarkably good, the ground a little a&s;cend|ing and de&s;ending with &s;ome &s;mall rivulets and a few &s;prings. When I got out of the beech ridge and nearer the river Mu&s;kingum the lands were more broken but equally rich with tho&s;e before mentioned, and abound|ing with brooks and &s;prings of water: there are al&s;o &s;everal &s;mall creeks that empty into that river, the bed of which is more than a mile wide in many places: the woods con&s;i&s;t of white and black oaks, walnut, hickory and &s;ugar tree in the greate&s;t abundance. In all parts of the country through which I came the game was very plenty, that is to &s;ay, deer, turkies and phea&s;ants, I likewi&s;e &s;aw a great many ve&s;tiges of bears and &s;ome elks.</P>
<P>I cro&s;&s;ed the river Mu&s;kingum about three or four miles below Fort Laurence, and cro&s;&s;ing all paths aim|ed for the Ohio river. All this time my food was goo&s;e|berries, young nettles, the juice of herbs, a few &s;er|vice berries, and &s;ome May apples, likewi&s;e, two young blackbirds and a turripine, which I devoured raw. When my food &s;at heavy on my &s;tomach, I u&s;ed to eat a little wild ginger which put all to rights.</P>
<P>I came upon Ohio river about five miles below fort M^cInto&s;h, in the evening of the 21&s;t day after I had made my e&s;cape, and on the twenty &s;econd, about &s;even o'clock in the morning, being the fourth day of July, arrived &s;afe, though very much fatigued, at the fort.</P>

<HEAD>A Short MEMOIR of the within mentioned Col. CRAWFORD.</HEAD>
<P>COL. CRAWFORD, was about 50 years of age, had been an old warrior again&s;t the &s;avages. He di&s;|tingui&s;hed him&s;elf early as a volunteer in the la&s;t war, and was taken notice of by colonel (now general) Wa&s;hington, who procured for him the commi&s;&s;ion of en&s;ign. As a parti&s;an he &s;howed him&s;elf very active, and was greatly &s;ucce&s;sful: He took &s;everal Indian towns, and did great &s;ervice in &s;couting, patrolling and defending the frontiers. At the commencement of this war he rai&s;ed a regiment in the back country by his own exertions: He had the commi&s;&s;ion of colonel in the continental army, and acted bravely on &s;everal occa&s;ions in the years 1776, 1777, and at other times. He held his commi&s;&s;ion at the time he took command of the militia, in the afore&s;aid expedition again&s;t the Indians: mo&s;t probably he had it with him when he was taken: He was a man of good judgment, &s;ingular good nature, and great humanity, and remarkable for his ho&s;pitality; few &s;trangers coming to the we&s;tern coun|try, and not &s;pending &s;ome days at the cro&s;&s;ings of the Yochaghany river where he lived; no man therefore could be more regretted.</P>

<HEAD>The NARRATIVE of JOHN SLOVER.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING in the la&s;t war been a pri&s;oner among&s;t the Indians many years, and &s;o being well ac|quainted with the country we&s;t of the Ohio I was em|ployed as a guide in the expedition under col. William Crawford again&s;t the Indian towns on or near the river Sandu&s;ky. It will be unnece&s;&s;ary for me to relate what is &s;o well known, the circum&s;tances and unfortunate event of that expedition; it will be &s;ufficient to ob|&s;erve, that having on Tue&s;day the fourth of June &s;ought the enemy near Sandu&s;ky, we lay that night in our camp, and the next day fired on each other at the di&s;|tance of three hundred yards, doing little or no execu|tion. In the evening of that day it was propo&s;ed by col. Crawford, as I have been &s;ince informed, to draw off with order; but at the moment of our retreat the Indians (who had probably perceived that we were about to retire) firing alarm guns, our men broke and rode off in confu&s;ion, treading down tho&s;e who were on foot, and leaving the wounded men who &s;upplicated to be taken with them.</P>
<P>I was with &s;ome others on the rear of our troops <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">ed|ing our hor&s;es in the glade, when our men began to break: The main body of our people had pa&s;&s;ed by me a con&s;iderable di&s;tance before I was ready to &s;et out. I overtook them before they cro&s;&s;ed the glade, and was advanced almo&s;t in front. The company in which I was had &s;eparated from me, and had endeavoured to pa&s;s a mora&s;s: for coming up I found their hor&s;es had &s;tuck fa&s;t in the mora&s;s, and endeavouring to pa&s;s, mine al&s;o in a &s;hort time &s;tuck fa&s;t I ought to have &s;aid, the company of five or &s;ix men with which I had been immediately connected, and who were &s;ome di&s;tance to the right of the main body, had &s;eparated from me, &amp;c.

and it was with the greate&s;t difficulty that I got acro&s;s it but which having at length done, I came up with the &s;ix men who had left their hor&s;es in the &s;ame man|ner I had done; two of the&s;e, my companions, having lo&s;t their guns.</P>
<P>We travelled that night making our cour&s;e towards Detroit, with a view to &s;hun the enemy, who we con|ceived to have taken the paths by which the main bo|dy of our people had retreated. Ju&s;t before day we got into a &s;econd deep mora&s;s, and were under the nece&s;&s;ity of detaining until it was light to &s;ee our way through it. The whole of this day we travelled toward the Shawan|e&s;e towns&punc; with a view of throwing our&s;elves &s;till far her out of the &s;earch of the enemy. About ten o'clock this day we &s;at down to eat a little, having ta&s;ted nothing from Tue&s;day, the day of our engagement, until this time which was on Thur&s;day; and now the only thing we had to eat was a &s;crap of pork to each. We had &s;at down ju&s;t by a warrior's path which we had not &s;u&s;pec|ted, when eight or nine warriors appeared Running off ha&s;tily we left our baggage and provi&s;ions, but were not di&s;covered by the party; for &s;kulking &s;ome time in the gra&s;s and bu&s;hes, we returned to the place and recovered our baggage. The warriors had halloo|ed as they pa&s;&s;ed, and were an&s;wered by others on our flanks</P>
<P>In our journey through the glades, or wide extended dry meadows, about twelve o'clock this day we di&s;co|vered a party of Indians in front, but &s;kulking in the gra&s;s and bu&s;hes were not perceived by them. In the&s;e glades we were in great danger, as we could be &s;een at a great di&s;tance. In the afternoon of this day there fell a heavy rain, the colde&s;t I ever felt. We halted while it rained, and then travelling on we &s;aw a party of the enemy about two hundred yards before us, but hiding our&s;elves in the bu&s;hes, we had again the good fortune not to be di&s;covered. This night we got out of the glades, having in the night cro&s;&s;ed the paths by which we had advanced to Sandu&s;ky. It was our de&s;ign to leave all the&s;e paths to the right, and to come in by the Tu&s;carawas. We &s;hould have made a much grea|ter progre&s;s, had it not been for two of our companions

who were lame; the one having his foot burnt, the other with a &s;welling in his knee of a rheumatic nature.</P>
<P>On this day, which was the &s;econd after the retreat, one of our company, the per&s;on affected with the rheu|matic &s;welling, was left behind &s;ome di&s;tance in a &s;wamp. Waiting for him &s;ome time we &s;aw him com|ing within one hundred yards, as I &s;at on the body of an old tree mending my mokki&s;ins, but taking my eye from him I &s;aw him no more. He had not ob&s;erved our tracks, but had gone a different way. We whi&s;tled on our chargers, and afterwards hallooed for him, but in vain Neverthele&s;s he was fortunate in mi&s;&s;ing us, for he afterwards came &s;afe into Wheeling <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This is a po&s;t of ours on the Ohio, about 70 miles below Fort Pitt.</NOTE>. We tra|velled on until night, and were on the waters of Mu&s;|kingum from the middle of this day.</P>
<P>Having catched a fawn this day we made a fire in the evening, and had a repa&s;t, having in the mean time eat nothing but the &s;mall bit of pork I mentioned be|fore. We &s;et off at break of day. About nine o'clock the third day we fell in with a party of the enemy about twenty miles from the Tu&s;carawas, which is about 135 miles from fort Pitt. They had come upon our tracks, or had been on our flanks, and di&s;covered us, and then having got before had way laid us, and fired before we perceived them. At the fir&s;t fire one of my companions fell before me, and another ju&s;t behind; the&s;e two had guns: there were &s;ix men in company, and four guns, two of the&s;e rendered u&s;ele&s;s by rea&s;on of the wet, when coming through the &s;wamp the fir&s;t night; we had try|ed to di&s;charge them, but could not. When the indi|ans fired I ran to a tree, but an Indian pre&s;enting him|&s;elf fifteen yards before me, de&s;ired me to deliver my|&s;elf up and I &s;hould not be hurt: My gun was in good order, but apprehending the enemy behind might di&s;|charge their pieces at me, I did not ri&s;k firing, which I had afterwards rea&s;on to regret, when I found what was to be my fate, and that the Indian who was before me and pre&s;ented his gun, was one of tho&s;e who had ju&s;t before fired. Two of my companions were taken

with me in the &s;ame manner, the Indians a&s;&s;uring us we &s;hould not be hurt. But one in company, James Paul, who had a gun in order made his e&s;cape, and has &s;ince come into Wheeling. One of the&s;e Indians knew me, and was of the party by whom I was taken in the la&s;t war. He came up and &s;poke to me calling me by my Indian name, Mannuchcothee, and upbraiding me for coming to war again&s;t them. I will take a moment here to relate &s;ome particulars of my fir&s;t captivity, and my life &s;ince.</P>
<P>I was taken from New River in Virginia by the Mi|ame&s;e, a nation of Indians by us called the Picts, among&s;t whom I lived &s;ix years; afterwards being &s;old to a Delaware, and by him put into the hands of a trader, I was carried among&s;t the Shawane&s;e, with whom I continued &s;ix years: &s;o that my whole time among&s;t the&s;e nations was twelve years, that is, from the eighth to the twentieth year of my age. At the treaty at Fort Pitt in the fall preceding what is called Dunmore's war, which, if I am right was in the year 1773, I came in with the Shawane&s;e nation to the trea|ty, and meeting with &s;ome of my relations at that place was by them &s;ollicited to relinqui&s;h the life of a &s;avage, which I did with &s;ome reluctance, this manner of life having become natural to me, ina&s;much as I had &s;carcely known any other. I enli&s;ted as a &s;oldier in the continental army at the commencement of the pre&s;ent <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> and &s;erved fifteen months. Having been properly di&s;charged I have &s;ince married, have a family, and am in communion with the church</P>
<P>To return: The party by whom we were made pri|&s;oners we had taken &s;ome hor&s;es, and left them at the glades we had pa&s;&s;ed the day before They had fol|lowed on our tracts from the&s;e glades; on our return to which we found the hor&s;es and rode We were carried to Wachatomakak, a town of the Mingoes and Shawane&s;e. I think it was on the third day we reached the town, which when we were approaching, the Indians, in who&s;e cu&s;tody we were, began to look <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">, having been kind to us before, and given us a little meat and flour to eat, which they had found or taken from &s;ome of our men on their retreat. This

town is &s;mall, and we were told was about two miles di&s;tant from the main town to which they meant to carry us.</P>
<P>The inhabitants from this town came out with clubs and tomhawks, &s;truck beat and abu&s;ed us greatly. One of my two companions they &s;eized, and having &s;tripped him naked blacked him with coal and water: This was the &s;ign of being burnt the man &s;eemed to &s;urmi&s;e it, and &s;hed tears. He a&s;ked me the meaning of his being blacked; but I was forbid by the enemy in their own language to tell him what was intended. In Engli&s;h which they &s;poke ea&s;ily, having been often at Fort Pitt, they a&s;&s;ured him he was not to be hurt. I know of no rea&s;on for making him the fir&s;t object of their cruelty, unle&s;s it was that he was the olde&s;t.</P>
<P>A warrior had been &s;ent to the greater town to ac|quaint them with our coming, and prepare them for the frolic; for on our coming to it, the inhabitants came out with guns, clubs and tomhawks. We were told that we had to run to the council hou&s;e, about three hundred yards. The man that was blacked was about twenty yards before us, in running the gauntlet: They made him their principal object, men, women and children beating him, and tho&s;e who had guns firing loads of powder on him as he ran naked, putting the muzzles of the guns to his body, &s;hout|ing, hallooing and beating their drums in the mean time.</P>
<P>The unhappy man had reached the door of the coun|cil hou&s;e, beat and wounded in a manner &s;hocking to the &s;ight; for having arrived before him we had it in our power to view the &s;pectacle: it was indeed the mo&s;t horrid that can be conceived: they had cut him with their tomhawks, &s;hot his body black, burnt it into holes with loads of powder blown into him; a large wadding had made a wound in his &s;houlder whence the blood gu&s;hed.</P>
<P>Agreeable to the declaration of the enemy when he fir&s;t &s;et out he had rea&s;on to think him&s;elf &s;ecure when he had reached the door of the council hou&s;e. This &s;eemed to be his hope, for coming up with great &s;trug|gling and endeavour, he laid hold of the door but was

pulled back and drawn away by them; finding they in|tended no mercy, but putting him to death he attempted &s;everal times to &s;natch or lay hold of &s;ome of their tom|hawks, but being weak could not effect it. We &s;aw him borne off and they were a long time beating, wounding, pur&s;uing and killing him.</P>
<P>That &s;ame evening I &s;aw the dead body of this man clo&s;e by the council hou&s;e. It was mangled cruelly and the blood mingled with the powder was rendered black.

Every warrior is admitted to the&s;e coun|cils; but only the chiefs or head warriors have the pri|vilege of &s;peaking. The head warriors are accounted &s;uch from the number of &s;calps and pri&s;oners they have taken.</P>
<P>The third day M&lsquo;Kee <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This man before the war was an Indian agent for the Briti&s;h. He was put on parole, broke it, went to the Indians and has &s;ince continued violently to incite them to make war again&s;t us.</NOTE> was in council, and after|wards was generally pre&s;ent. He &s;poke little, and did not a&s;k any que&s;tions or &s;peak to me at all. He lives about two miles out of the town, has a hou&s;e built of &s;quared logs with a &s;hingled roof&punc; he was dre&s;&s;ed in gold laced cloths. I had &s;een him at the former town through which I pa&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>I think it was on the la&s;t day of the council, &s;ave one, that a &s;peech came from Detroit, brought by a warrior who had been coun&s;elling with the commanding officer at that place. The &s;peech had been long expected, and was in an&s;wer to one &s;ometime before &s;ent from the town to Detroit: It was in a belt of Wampum, and be|gan with addre&s;&s;ing them, "My children," and en|quiring why they continued to take pri&s;oners? "Pro|vi&s;ions are &s;carce; when pri&s;oners are brought in we are obliged to maintain them, and &s;till &s;ome of them are running away, and carrying tidings of our affairs. When any of your people fall into the hands of the re|bels they &s;how no mercy: why then &s;hould you take pri&s;oners? Take no more pri&s;oners, my children, of any &s;ort; man, woman or child."</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="017993_0024_0FA412D74B0624C0">Two days after a party of every nation that was near being collected, it was determined on to take no more pri&s;oners of any &s;ort. They had held a large council, and the determination was, that if it were po&s;&s;ible they could find a child of a &s;pan or three inches long, they would &s;how no mercy to it. At the conclu&s;ion of the council it was agreed upon by all the tribes pre&s;ent, viz. the Tawaws, Chiappawaws, the Wiondots, the Min|goes, the Delawares, the Shawane&s;e, the Mun&s;es, and a part of the Cherokees, that &s;hould any of the nations who were not pre&s;ent take any pri&s;oner, the&s;e would ri&s;e again&s;t them, take away the pri&s;oners and put them to death.</P>
<P>In the cour&s;e of the&s;e deliberations I under&s;tood what was &s;aid perfectly. They laid plans again&s;t our &s;ettle|ments of Kentucky, the Falls, and towards Wheeling. The&s;e it will be unnece&s;&s;ary for me to mention in this narrative, more e&s;pecially as the Indians finding me to have e&s;caped, and knowing that I would not fail to communicate the&s;e de&s;igns, will be led to alter their re|&s;olutions.</P>
<P>There was one council held at which I was not pre|&s;ent: The warriors had &s;ent for me as u&s;ual, but the &s;quaw with whom I lived would not &s;uffer me to go, but hid me under a large quantity of &s;kins. It may have been from an unwillingne&s;s that I &s;hould hear in coun|cil the determination with re&s;pect to me, that I &s;hould be burnt.</P>
<P>About this time twelve men were brought in from Kentucky, three of whom were burnt on this day; the remainder were di&s;tributed to other towns, and all, as the Indians informed me, were burnt. This was after the &s;peech came from Detroit.</P>
<P>On this day al&s;o I &s;aw an Indian who had ju&s;t come into town, and who &s;aid that the pri&s;oner he was bring|ing to be burnt, and who he &s;aid was a doctor, had made his e&s;cape from him. I knew this mu&s;t have been Dr. Knight, who went as &s;urgeon of the expedi|tion. The Indian had a wound four inches long in his head, which he acknowledged the doctor had given him: he was cut to the &s;cull. His &s;tory was, that he had untied the doctor, being a&s;ked by him to do &s;o, the doctor promi&s;ing that be would not go away; that while
<PB N="26" REF="017993_0025_0FA412D7E0046D28">
he was employed in kindling the fire, the doctor &s;natch|ed up the gun, had come behind and &s;truck him; that he then made a &s;troke at the doctor with his knife, which he laid hold of, and his fingers were cut almo&s;t off, the knife being drawn through his hand&punc; that he gave the doctor two &s;tabs, one in the belly, the other in the back; &s;aid the doctor was a great, big, tall, &s;trong man. Being now adopted in an Indian family, and having &s;ome confidence for my &s;afety, I took the liberty to contradict this, and &s;aid that I knew the doc|tor, who was a weak, little man. The other warriors laughed immoderately, and did not &s;eem to credit him<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>It is well known that Mr. Slover mentioned the&s;e circum&s;tances at his fir&s;t coming into Wheeling, and before he could have known the relation of the doctor, &s;o that this is an evidence of the truth of the doctor's account, and of his own.</P>
<BIBL>H. B.</BIBL></NOTE>. At this time I was told that col. Crawford was burnt, and they greatly exulted over it.</P>
<P>The day after the council I have mentioned, about forty warriors accompanied by George Girty came early in the morning round the hou&s;e where I was. The &s;quaw gave me up; I was &s;itting before the door of the hou&s;e; they put a rope round my neck, tyed my arms behind my back, &s;tripped me naked, and blacked me in the u&s;ual manner. George Girty as &s;oon as I was tyed, damned me, and &s;aid that I now &s;hould get what I had de&s;erved many years. I was led away to a town di&s;tant about five miles, to which a me&s;&s;enger had been di&s;patched to de&s;ire them to prepare to receive me: Arriving at this town I was beaten with clubs and the pipe ends of their tomhawks, and was kept for &s;ome time tied to a tree before a hou&s;e door. In the mean while the inhabitants &s;et out to another town about two miles di&s;tant, where I was to be burnt, and where I ar|rived about three o'clock in the afternoon.</P>
<P>Here al&s;o was a council hou&s;e, part of it covered and part of it without a roof. In the part of it where no cover was, but only &s;ides built up, there &s;tood a po&s;t about &s;ixteen feet in height, and in the middle of the hou&s;e around the po&s;t, there were three piles of wood built about three feet high and four feet from the po&s;t.
<PB N="27" REF="017993_0026_0FA412D8A18DFF10">
Being brought to the po&s;t my arms were tyed behind me, and the thong or cord with which they were bound was fa&s;tened to the po&s;t; a rope al&s;o was put about my neck, and tyed to the po&s;t about four feet above my head. During the time they were tying me, piles of wood were kindled and began to flame.</P>
<P>Death by burning, which appeared to be now my fate, I had re&s;olved to &s;u&s;tain with patience. The di|vine grace of God had made it le&s;s alarming to me; for on my way this day I had been greatly exerci&s;ed in regard to my latter end. I knew my&s;elf to have been a regular member of the church, and to have &s;ought repentance for my &s;ins; but though I had often heard of the faith of a&s;&s;urance, had known nothing of it; but early this day, in&s;tantaneou&s;ly by a change wrought upon me, &s;udden and perceivable as lightning, an a&s;&s;urance of my peace made with God, &s;prung up in my mind. The following words were the &s;ubject of my meditation&mdash;"In peace thou &s;halt &s;ee God. Fear not tho&s;e who can kill the body. In peace &s;halt thou depart." I was on this occa&s;ion by a confidence in mind&punc; not to be re&s;i&s;ted, fully a&s;&s;ured of my &s;alvation: This being the ca&s;e, I was willing, &s;atisfied, and glad to die.</P>
<P>I was tyed to the po&s;t, as I have already &s;aid, and the flame was now kindled. The day was clear, not a cloud to be &s;een; if there were clouds low in the ho|ri&s;on, the &s;ides of the hou&s;e prevented me from &s;eeing them, but I heard no thunder, or ob&s;erved any &s;ign of approaching rain. Ju&s;t as the fire of one pile began to blaze, the wind ro&s;e; from the time they began to kin|dle the fire and to tie me to the po&s;t, until the wind began to blow, was about fifteen minutes. The wind blew a hurricane, and the rain followed in le&s;s than three minutes. The rain fell violent; and the fire, though it began to blaze con&s;iderably, was in&s;tant|ly extingui&s;hed. The rain la&s;ted about a quarter of an hour.</P>
<P>When it was over the &s;avages &s;tood amazed, and were a long time &s;ilent. At la&s;t one &s;aid, We will let him alone till morning, and take a whole days frolic in burning him. The &s;un at this time was about three hours high. It was agreed upon, and the rope about my neck was untied, and making me &s;it down, they

began to dance around me. They continued dancing in this manner until eleven o'clock at night; in the mean time, beating, kicking, and wounding me with their tomhawks and clubs <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>I ob&s;erved marks on the man when I &s;aw him, which was eight or ten days after he came in, particu|larly a wound above his right eye brow, which he had received with the pipe end of a tomhawk; but his back and body generally had been injured.</P>
<BIBL>H. B.</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P>At la&s;t one of the warriors, the Half Moon, a&s;ked me if I was &s;leepy? I an&s;wered, Yes. The head war|rior then cho&s;e out three men to take care of me. I was taken to a block hou&s;e; my arms were tied until the cord was hid in the fle&s;h; they were tied in two pla|ces, round the wri&s;t and above the elbows. A rope was fa&s;tened about my neck, and tied to a beam of the hou&s;e, but permitting me to lie down on a board. The three warriors were con&s;tantly harra&s;&s;ing and troubling me, &s;aying, "How will you like to eat fire to morrow&mdash; you will kill no more Indians now." I was in expec|tation of their going to &s;leep; when at length, about an hour before day break, two laid down; the third &s;moked a pipe, talked to me, and a&s;ked the &s;ame pain|ful que&s;tions. About half an hour after he al&s;o laid down, and I heard him begin to &s;nore. In&s;tantly I went to work, and as my arms were perfectly dead with the cord, I laid my&s;elf down upon my right arm which was behind my back, and keeping it fa&s;t with my fingers, which had &s;till &s;ome life and &s;trength, I &s;lipped the cord from my left arm over my elbow and my wri&s;t. One of the warriors now got up and &s;tirred the fire: I was apprehen&s;ive that I &s;hould be examined, and thought it was over with me; but my hopes reviv|ed when now he lay down again. I then attempted to unloo&s;e the rope about my neck, tryed to gnaw it but in vain, as it was as thick as my thumb and as hard as iron, being made of a buffaloe hide: I wrought with it a long time, gave it out, and could &s;ee no relief. At this time I &s;aw day break and heard the cock crow: I made a &s;econd attempt almo&s;t without hope, pulling the rope by putting my fingers between my neck and it, and to

my great &s;urpri&s;e it came ea&s;ily untyed: it was a noo&s;e with two or three knots tyed over it.</P>
<P>I &s;tept over the warriors as they lay, and having got out of the hou&s;e looked back to &s;ee if there was any di&s;turb|ance; I then ran through the town into a corn field; in my way I &s;aw a &s;quaw with four or five children lying a&s;leep under a tree: going a different way into the field I untyed my arm which was greatly &s;welled and turned black: having ob&s;erved a number of hor&s;es in the glade as I ran through it, I went back to catch one, and on my way found a piece of an old rug or quilt hanging on a fence which I took with me: having caught the hor&s;e, the rope with which I had been tyed &s;erving for a hal|ter, I rode off: the hor&s;e was &s;trong and &s;wift, and the woods being open and the country level, about ten o'clock that day I cro&s;&s;ed the Siota river at a place by computation fifty full miles from the town. I had rode about twenty five miles on this &s;ide Siota by three o'clock in the afternoon, when the hor&s;e began to fail and could no longer go on a trot. I in&s;tantly left him and on foot ran about twenty miles farther that day, mak|ing in the whole the di&s;tance of near one hundred miles, In the evening I heard hallooing behind me and for this rea&s;on did not halt until about ten o'clock at night, when I &s;at down, was extremely &s;ick and vomited; but when the moon ro&s;e which might have been about two hours after, I went on and travelled until day.</P>
<P>During the night I had a path, but in the morning judged it prudent to for&s;ake the path and take a ridge for the di&s;tance of fifteen miles, in a line at right angles to my cour&s;e, putting back as I went along with a &s;tick the weeds which I had bended, le&s;t I &s;hould be track'd by the enemy. I lay the next night on the waters of Mu&s;kingum: the nettles had been trouble&s;ome to me after my cro&s;&s;ing the Siota, having nothing to defend my&s;elf but the piece of a rug which I had found, and which while I rode I u&s;ed under me by way of &s;addle; the briars and thorns were now painful to and prevent|ed me from travelling in the night until the moon ap|peared: In the mean time I was hindred from &s;leeping by the mu&s;ketoes, for even in the day I was under the nece&s;&s;ity of travelling with a handful of bu&s;hes to bru&s;h them from my body.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="017993_0029_0FA412DE954EC1F8">The &s;econd night I reached Cu&s;hakim; next day came to Newcomer's town, where I got about &s;even ra&s;berries, which were the fir&s;t thing I ate from the morning in which the Indians had taken me to burn me until this time, which was now about three o'clock the fourth day. I felt hunger very little, but was extreme|ly weak; I &s;wam Mu&s;kingum river at Oldcomers town, the river being about two hundred yards wide having reached the bank I &s;at down, looked back and thought I had a &s;tart of the indians if any &s;hould pur&s;ue. That evening I travelled about five miles, next day came to Stillwater a &s;mall river, in a branch of which I got two &s;mall crafi&s;h to eat: Next night I lay within five miles of Wheeling, but had not &s;lept a wink during this whole time, being rendered impo&s;&s;ible by the mu&s;ketoes, which it was my con&s;tant employment to bru&s;h away. Next day came to Wheeling and &s;aw a man on the i&s;|land in the Ohio oppo&s;ite to that po&s;t, and calling to him and a&s;king for particular per&s;ons who had been on the expedition, and telling him I was Stover, at length, with great difficulty, he was per&s;uaded to come over and bring me acro&s;s in his canoe <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>It has been &s;aid, that the putting to death the Mo|ravian Indians has been the cau&s;e of the cruelties prac|ti&s;ed on the pri&s;oners taken at Sandu&s;ky. But though this has been made an excu&s;e by the refugees among&s;t the &s;avages, and by the Briti&s;h, yet it mu&s;t be well known, that it has been the cu&s;tom of the &s;avages at all times. I have it from colonel John Campbell, who is lately from Chamblee, where he has been in confine|ment a long time, and was taken on the Ohio &s;ome years ago, that two men who were taken with him were put to death at the Shawne&s;e towns in the &s;ame manner in which Harri&s;on was afterwards executed, viz. by blowing powder into their bodies. A large load blow|ed into the body of one of the&s;e men, reached his kid|neys; the pain throwing him into rage and madne&s;s, the &s;avages were uncommonly diverted with the vio|lence of his exclamation and ge&s;tures; boys of the town particularly following him, and con&s;idering it as ex|cellent &s;port. In the evening his head was cut off, and an end put to his mi&s;ery. Col. Campbell him&s;elf was 
<PB N="31" REF="017993_0030_0FA412D0C914D440">
led out to make &s;port of the &s;ame kind, but was &s;aved, by the interpo&s;ition, I think, of Elliot.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time, though I would &s;trike away this excu&s;e which is urged for the &s;avages, I am far from approving the Moravian &s;laughter. Doubtle&s;s the ex|i&s;tence of that body of people in our neighbourhood, was of di&s;advantage, as they were under the nece&s;&s;ity of receiving and refre&s;hing the Sandu&s;ky &s;avages as they came to war, and as they returned; and as no doubt &s;ome among&s;t them communicated intelligence of any expedition on foot again&s;t the enemy. I am al|&s;o di&s;po&s;ed to believe, that the greater part of the men put to death were warriors; this appears from the te&s;|timony of one again&s;t another, from the confe&s;&s;ion of many, from their &s;inging the war &s;ong when ordered out to be tomhawked, from the cut and painting of their hair, and from other circum&s;tances. The greater part of the Moravian men who were really peaceable or well affected to us, having been carried off the fall be|fore, and &s;till detained at Sandu&s;ky. But the putting to death the women and children, who &s;ang hymns at their execution, mu&s;t be con&s;idered as unju&s;tifiable in|excu&s;able homicide; and that the colonel who com|manded the party, and who is &s;aid per&s;everingly, con|trary to the remon&s;trances of officers pre&s;ent, to have enjoined the perpetration of the act, has not yet been called to an account, is a di&s;grace to the &s;tate of Penn|&s;ylvania.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Mr. BAILEY,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WITH the narrative enclo&s;ed, I &s;ubjoin &s;ome ob&s;er|vations with regard to the animals, vulgarly cal|led Indians. It is not my intention to write any labour|ed e&s;&s;ay; for at &s;o great a di&s;tance from the city, and &s;o long unaccu&s;tomed to write, I have &s;carcely re&s;olution to put pen to paper. Having an opportunity to know &s;omething of the character of this race of men, from the deeds they perpetrate daily around me, I think proper to &s;ay &s;omething on the &s;ubject; indeed &s;everal years ago, and before I left your city, I had thought different from &s;ome others with re&s;pect to the right of &s;oil, and the propriety of forming treaties and making peace with them. In the United States Magazine, in the year 1779, I publi&s;hed a di&s;&s;ertation denying them to have a right to the &s;oil: I perceive a writer in your very ele|gant and u&s;eful paper, has taken up the &s;ame &s;ubject, under the &s;ignature of Caractacus, and unan&s;werably &s;hown, that their claim to the exten&s;ive countries of America, is wild and inadmi&s;&s;ible: I will take the li|berty in this place, to pur&s;ue this &s;ubject a little.</P>
<P>On what is their claim founded?&mdash;Occupancy. A wild India with his &s;kin painted red, and a feather through his no&s;e, has &s;et his foot on the broad continent of North and South America: a &s;econd wild Indian with his ears cut in ringlets, or his no&s;e &s;lit like a &s;wine or a malefactor, al&s;o &s;ets his foot on the &s;ame exten&s;ive tract of &s;oil: Let the fir&s;t Indian make a talk to his bro|ther, and bid him take his foot off the continent, for he being fir&s;t upon it, had occupied the whole, to kill buffaloes, and tall elks with long horns. This claim, in the rea&s;oning of &s;ome men would be ju&s;t, and the &s;e|cond &s;avage ought to depart in his canoe, and &s;eek a continent where no prior occupant claimed the &s;oil. Is this claim of occupancy of a very early date? When Noah's three &s;ons, Shem, Ham, and Japhet, went out to the three quarters of the old world, Ham to Africa, Shem to A&s;ia, and Japhet to Europe, did each claim a quarter of the world for his re&s;idence? Suppo&s;e Ham to have &s;pent his time fi&s;hing or gathering oy&s;ters in the Red Sea, never once &s;tretching his leg in a long walk to &s;ee his va&s;t dominions, from the mouth of the Nile, acro&s;s the mountains of Ethiopia and the river Niger
<PB N="33" REF="017993_0032_0FA412E09817A210">
to the cape of Good Hope, where the Hottentotts, a cleanly people, now &s;tray; or &s;uppo&s;ing him, like a Scots pedlar, to have travelled over many thou&s;and leagues of that country: would this give him a right to the &s;oil?&mdash;In the opinion of &s;ome men it would e&s;tabli&s;h an exclu&s;ive right. Let a man in more modern times take a journey or voyage like Patrick Kennedy and o|thers, to the heads of the Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi or Mi&s;&s;ouri rivers, would he gain a right ever after to exclude all per&s;ons from drinking the water of the&s;e &s;treams? Might not a &s;econd Adam make a talk to them and &s;ay, is the whole of this water nece&s;&s;ary to allay your thir&s;t, and may not I al&s;o drink of it?</P>
<P>The whole of this earth was given to man, and all de|&s;cendents of Adam have a right to &s;hare it equally. There is no right of primogeniture in the laws of na|ture and of nations. There is rea&s;on that a tall man, &s;uch as the chaplain in the American army we call the High Prie&s;t, &s;hould have a larger &s;pot of ground to &s;tretch him&s;elf upon; or that a man with a big belly, like a goodly alderman of London, &s;hould have a larger garden to produce beans and cabbage for his appetite, but that an agile, nimble runner, like an Indian called the Big Cat, at Fort Pitt, &s;hould have more than his neighbours becau&s;e he has traver&s;ed a greater &s;pace, I can &s;ee no rea&s;on.</P>
<P>I have conver&s;ed with &s;ome per&s;ons and found their mi&s;takes on this &s;ubject, to ari&s;e from a view of claims by individuals in a &s;tate of &s;ociety, &s;ome holding a greater proportion of the &s;oil than others; but this is according to the laws to which they have con&s;ented; an individual holding one acre, cannot encroach on him who has a thou&s;and, becau&s;e he is bound by the law which &s;ecures property in this unequal manner. This is the municipal law of the &s;tate under which he lives. The member of a di&s;tant &s;ociety is not excluded by the laws from a right to the &s;oil: He claims under the general law of nature, which gives a right, equally to all, to &s;o much of the &s;oil as is nece&s;&s;ary for &s;ub&s;i&s;t|ance. Should a German from the clo&s;ely peopled coun|try of the Rhine, come into Penn&s;ylvania, more thinly peopled, he would be ju&s;tifiable in demanding a &s;ettle|ment, though his per&s;onal force would not be &s;ufficient
<PB N="34" REF="017993_0033_0FA412E0EE313200">
to effect it. It may be &s;aid that the cultivation or me|lioration of the earth, gives a property in it. No&mdash;if an individual has ingro&s;&s;ed more than is nece&s;&s;ary to produce grain for him to live upon, his u&s;ele&s;s gardens, fields and plea&s;ure walks, may be &s;eized upon by the per&s;on who not finding convenient ground el&s;ewhere, choo&s;es to till them for his &s;upport.</P>
<P>It is a u&s;ual way of de&s;troying an opinion, by pur&s;u|ing it to its con&s;equence. In the pre&s;ent ca&s;e we may &s;ay, that if the vi&s;iting one acre of ground could give a right to it, the vi&s;iting a milion would give a right on the &s;ame principle; and thus a few &s;urly ill natured men, might in the earlier ages, have excluded half the human race from a &s;ettlement, or &s;hould any have fixed them&s;elves on territory, vi&s;ited before they had &s;et a foot upon it, they mu&s;t be con&s;idered as invaders of the rights of others.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid that an individual, building a hou&s;e or fa|bricating a machine has an exclu&s;ive right to it, and why not tho&s;e who improve the earth? I would &s;ay, &s;hould a man build hou&s;es on a greater part of the &s;oil than falls to his &s;hare, I would, in a &s;tate of nature, take away a proportion of the &s;oil and the hou&s;es from him, but a machine or any work of art, does not le&s;&s;en the means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence to the human race, which an exten&s;ive occupation of the &s;oil does.</P>
<P>Claims founded on the fir&s;t di&s;covery of &s;oil are futile. When gold, jewels, manufactures, or any work of men's hands is lo&s;t, the finder is intitled to &s;ome reward, that is, he has &s;ome claim on the thing found, for a &s;hare of it.</P>
<P>When by indu&s;try or the exerci&s;e of genius, &s;ome|thing unu&s;ual is invented in medicine or in other mat|ters, the author doubtle&s;s has a claim to an exclu&s;ive profit by it, but who will &s;ay the &s;oil is lo&s;t, or that any one can found a claim by di&s;covering it. The earth with its woods and rivers &s;till exi&s;ts, and the only ad|vantage I would allow to any individual for having, ca&s;t his eye fir&s;t on any particular part of it, is the privilege of making the fir&s;t choice of &s;ituation. I would think the man a fool and unju&s;t, who would exclude me from drinking the waters of the Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi river, becau&s;e he had fir&s;t &s;een it. He would be equally &s;o who, would
<PB N="35" REF="017993_0034_0FA412E1A2408E00">
exclude me from &s;ettling in the country we&s;t of the Ohio becau&s;e in cha&s;ing a buffaloe, he had been fir&s;t o|ver it.</P>
<P>The idea of an exclu&s;ive right to the &s;oil in the na|tives had its origin in the policy of the fir&s;t di&s;coverers, the kings of Europe. Should they deny the right of the natives from their fir&s;t treading on the continent, they would take away the right of di&s;covery in them&s;elves, by &s;ailing on the coa&s;t. As the ve&s;tige of the mokki&s;on in one ca&s;e gave a right, &s;o the cruize in the other was the foundation of a claim.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who under the&s;e kings, derived grants, were led to countenance the idea, for otherwi&s;e why &s;hould kings grant or they hold exten&s;ive tracts of country.</P>
<P>Men become en&s;laved to an opinion that has been long entertained. Hence it is that many wi&s;e and good men will talk of the right of &s;avages to immen&s;e tracts of oil.</P>
<P>What u&s;e do the&s;e ring &s;treaked, &s;potted and &s;peckled cattle make of the &s;oil? Do they till it? Revelation &s;aid to man, "Thou &s;halt till the ground." This a|lone is human life. It is favourable to population, to &s;cience, to the information of a human mind in the wor|&s;hip of a God. Warburton has well &s;aid, that before you can make an Indian a chri&s;tian you mu&s;t teach him agriculture and reduce him to a civilized life. To live by tilling is <HI>more humano,</HI> by hunting is <HI>more be&s;tiarum.</HI> I would as &s;oon admit a right in the buffaloe to grant lands, as in Killbuck, the Big Cat, the Big Dog, or any of the ragged wretches that are called chiefs and &s;a|chems. What would you think of going to a big lick, or place where the bea&s;ts collect to lick the &s;aline and nitrous earth and water, and addre&s;&s;ing your&s;elf to a great buffaloe to grant you land? It is true he could not make the mark of the &s;tone or the mountain in his deed; but he could &s;et his cloven foot to the paper like the great Ottoman, the father of the Turks, who when he put his &s;ignature to an in&s;trument, dipt his hand and &s;preading fingers in the ink and laid them on the parchment. To &s;ee how far the folly of mankind would go, I had once a thought of &s;upplicating one of the&s;e great elkes or buffaloes that run to the we&s;tward, to make me a grant of a hundred thou&s;and acres: I could
<PB N="36" REF="017993_0035_0FA412E26472EEC0">
prove he had bru&s;hed the weeds with his tail, and run fifty miles. I wonder if Congre&s;s or the different &s;tates would recognize the claim. I am &s;o far from thinking the Indians have right to the &s;oil, that not having made a better u&s;e of it for many hundred years, I conceive they have forfeited all pretence to claim, and ought to be driven from it.</P>
<P>With regard to forming treaties or making peace with this race, the&s;e are my ideas:&mdash;They have the &s;hapes of men and may be of the human &s;pecies, but certainly in their pre&s;ent &s;tate they approach nearer the character of Devils: take an Indian is there any faith in him? Can you bind him by favours? Can you tru&s;t his word or confide in his promi&s;e? When he makes war upon you, when he takes you pri&s;oner and has you in his power will he &s;pare you? In this he departs from the law of nature, by which, according to baron Mon|te&s;quieu and every other man who thinks on the &s;ub|ject, it is unju&s;tifiable to take away the life of him who &s;ubmits; the conqueror in doing otherwi&s;e becomes a murderer, who ought to be put to death. On this prin|ciple are not the whole Indian nations murderers? Ma|ny of them may have not had an opportunity of putting pri&s;oners to death, but the &s;entiment which they enter|tain leads them invariably to do this when they have it in their power or judge it expedient: the&s;e principles con&s;titute them murderers, and they ought to be prevented from carrying them into execution, as we would prevent a common hommicide, who &s;hould be mad enough to conceive him&s;elf ju&s;tifiable in killing men.</P>
<P>The tortures which they exerci&s;e on the bodies of their pri&s;oners, ju&s;tify extirmination. Gelo of Syra|cu&s;e made war on the Carthaginians, becau&s;e they of|fered up human victims, and made peace with them on condition they would cea&s;e from this unnatural and cruel &s;uper&s;tition If we could have any faith in the &s;avages, I would &s;uffer them to live, provided they would no longer make war among&s;t them&s;elves, or a|gain&s;t others by lurking privately on the path ways of the wood, and putting unarmed and defencele&s;s inha|bitants to death or attacking women and children in the frontier families, and on their cea&s;ing in the mean to exerci&s;e torture.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="017993_0036_0FA412E3231097D0">I do not know but I ought to recal my word and &s;ay, that even reforming from the&s;e practices, they ought not to live: The&s;e nations are &s;o degenerate from the life of man, &s;o devoid of every &s;entiment of genero&s;ity, &s;o prone to every vicious exce&s;s of pa&s;&s;ion, &s;o faithle&s;s, and &s;o incapable of all civilization, that it is dangerous to the good order of the world that they &s;hould exi&s;t in it. Why was it that a &s;tream of fire was &s;ent to burn up Sodom and Gomorrah, or &s;ome years before a de|luge of water to wa&s;h the old world, but that the evil example of wicked men and horrid deeds might be &s;truck from the knowledge and memory of the world? Why was it that the Canaanites were &s;entenced to ex|tirpation, but becau&s;e their rites and practices rendered them unfit to live. With what zeal did that good man Samuel hew Agag in pieces? With the &s;ame zeal ought every whig in America to hew the Big Pipe, or the Big Rattle&s;nake, or any of the&s;e, yclept by whatever name, wherever he can find them It may be &s;aid the I&s;rael|ites had an order from the Lord to put to death the Ca|naanites. I think when we &s;ee men by their practice murderers, by every &s;entiment and principle of heart carried out to &s;hed blood privately; it is a &s;ufficient or|der to exterminate the whole brood. As the Seceder &s;aid of Satan, what will you make of them, my belov|ed, but ill, vile, evil devils?</P>
<P>There have been in&s;tances of &s;everal of the&s;e crea|tures that have been taken young from the woods, and put to public &s;chools in America; I do not know one who has even by the&s;e means been rendered a u&s;eful member of &s;ociety: They retain the temper of their race. I knew one of the&s;e, a certain John Montour, who had been educated at one of the northern &s;emina|ries, taught Greek and Latin, and in this war dignified by Congre&s;s with a commi&s;&s;ion of captain. No greater &s;avage ever exi&s;ted. He had murdered &s;everal of his own people, and being obliged to avoid the re&s;entment of their relations, had fled from one place to another, and at la&s;t joined our arms at Fort Pitt. I &s;aw this man with the bloody &s;calp of an Indian in his hand, which he had ju&s;t taken off, having fir&s;t tomhawked the crea|ture, though &s;ubmitting and praying for his life. The Indian had been for &s;ome time a pri&s;oner with us, on
<PB N="38" REF="017993_0037_0FA412E3E1C756C0">
&s;u&s;picion of having acted again&s;t us, but having always profe&s;&s;ed him&s;elf a friend, and not being yet convicted of any murder, it was ruthful in his fellow &s;avage to put him to death. I am well per&s;uaded, that for a keg of whi&s;key you might induce any Indian to murder his wife, child, or be&s;t friend. I am informed, that the experiment was actually made by a trader. An Indian for a quart of whi&s;ky, in one of the we&s;tern towns cut the throat of his own child.</P>
<P>This being the character of the&s;e men, &s;hall we not wi&s;h to di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s them of the goodly lands, &s;prings and rivers to the we&s;tward, which they have &s;o long made a &s;cene of horror by their practices. At the termina|tion of the pre&s;ent war, when they are no longer a&s;&s;i&s;t|ed by our enemies, it will be ea&s;y to drive them be|yond the lakes: In&s;tead of forming treaties, and &s;end|ing any other talk to them, and prophaning our&s;elves by calling them brothers, I would &s;imply let them know that they are no longer to &s;how them&s;elves below the heads of the great rivers that fall from the we&s;tward into the Ohio and Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi waters: After &s;ome period they may be reduced to more di&s;tant bounds, until dri|ven to the cold &s;nows of the north we&s;t, where darkne&s;s reigns &s;ix months in the year, if the continent extends &s;o far, their practices &s;hall be ob&s;cured, and the tribes gradually aboli&s;hed.</P>
