<OPENER><SALUTE>Friends and Fellow Citizens,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THERE are times and &s;ea&s;ons when <HI>general evils</HI> &s;pread general alarm and unea&s;ine&s;s, and yet ari&s;e from cau&s;es too complicated, and too little under&s;tood by many, to produce a unanimity of opinions re&s;pecting their remedies. Hence it is, that on &s;uch occa&s;ions, the conflict of arguments too often excites a conflict of pa&s;&s;ions, and intro|duces a degree of di&s;cord and animo&s;ity, which, by agitating the public mind, di&s;po&s;e it to precipitation and extravagance. They who on the ocean have been unexpectedly inveloped with tempe&s;ts, or &s;uddenly entangled among rocks and &s;hoals, know the value of that &s;erene, &s;elf-po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion and pre&s;ence of mind, to which in &s;uch ca&s;es they owed their pre&s;ervation: nor will the heroes who have given us victory and peace, he&s;itate to acknowledge, that we are as much indebted for tho&s;e ble&s;|&s;ings to the calm previ&s;ion, and cool intrepidity which planned and conducted our military mea&s;ures, as to the glowing animation with which they were executed.</P>
<P>While rea&s;on retains her rule, while men are as ready to receive as to give advice, and as willing to be convinced them&s;elves, as to con|vince others, there are few political evils from which a free and en|lightened people cannot deliver them&s;elves. It is unque&s;tionably true, that the great body of the people love their country, and wi&s;h it pro&s;|perity; and this ob&s;ervation is particularly applicable to the people of a <HI>free</HI> country, for they have more and &s;tronger rea&s;ons for loving it than others. It is not therefore to vicious motives that the unhappy divi&s;i|ons which &s;ometimes prevail among them are to be imputed; the peo|ple at large always mean well, and although they may, on certain oc|ca&s;ions,
<PB N="4" REF="021175_0003_0FB2705351F749F8">
be mi&s;led by the coun&s;els, or injured by the efforts of the few who expect more advantage from the wreck, than from the pre&s;erva|tion of national pro&s;perity, yet the motives of the&s;e few, are by no means to be confounded with tho&s;e of the community in general.</P>
<P>That &s;uch &s;eeds of di&s;cord and danger have been di&s;&s;eminated and begin to take root in America, as unle&s;s eradicated will &s;oon poi&s;on our gardens and our fields, is a truth much to be lamented; and the more &s;o, as their growth rapidly encrea&s;es, while we are wa&s;ting the &s;ea&s;on in hone&s;tly but imprudently di&s;puting, not whether they &s;hall be pulled up, but by whom, in what manner, and with what in&s;truments the work &s;hall be done.</P>
<P>When the King of Great-Britain, mi&s;guided by men who did not merit his confidence, a&s;&s;erted the unju&s;t claim of binding us in all ca&s;es what&s;oever, and prepared to obtain our &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion by force, the object which engro&s;&s;ed our attention, however important, was neverthele&s;s plain and &s;imple. "What &s;hall we do?" was the que&s;tion&mdash;the people an&s;wered, let us unite our coun&s;els and our arms. They &s;ent Delegates to Congre&s;s, and &s;oldiers to the field. Confiding in the probity and wi&s;dom of Congre&s;s, they received their recommendations as if they had been laws; and that ready acquie&s;cence in their advice enabled tho&s;e patriots to &s;ave their country. Then there was little lei&s;ure or di&s;po&s;ition for controver&s;y re&s;pecting the expediency of mea&s;ures&mdash;ho&s;|tile fleets &s;oon filled our ports, and ho&s;tile armies &s;pread de&s;olation on our &s;hores. Union was then con&s;idered as the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential of human means, and we almo&s;t wor&s;hipped it with as much fervor, as pagans in di&s;tre&s;s formerly implored the protection of their tutelar deities. That Union was the child of wi&s;dom&mdash;Heaven ble&s;&s;ed it, and it wrought out our political &s;alvation.</P>
<P>That glorious war was &s;ucceded by an advantageous peace. When danger di&s;appeared, ea&s;e, tranquility, and a &s;en&s;e of &s;ecurity loo&s;ened the bands of union; and Congre&s;s and &s;oldiers and good faith depreci|ated with their apparent importance. Recommendations lo&s;t their in|fluence, and requi&s;itions were rendered nugatory, not by their want of propriety, but by their want of power. The &s;pirit of private gain ex|pelled the &s;pirit of public good, and men became more intent on the means of enriching and aggrandizing them&s;elves, than of enriching and aggrandizing their country. Hence the war-worn veteran, who&s;e re|ward
<PB N="5" REF="021175_0004_0FB27056EECB0100">
for toils and wounds exi&s;ted in written promi&s;es, found Congre&s;s without the means, and too many of the States without the di&s;po&s;ition to do him ju&s;tice. Hard nece&s;&s;ity compelled him, and others under &s;imilar circum&s;tances, to &s;ell their hone&s;t claims on the public for a lit|tle bread; and thus unmerited misfortunes and patriotic di&s;tre&s;&s;es be|came articles of &s;peculation and commerce.</P>
<P>The&s;e and many other evils, too well known to require enumeration, imperceptibly &s;tole in upon us, and acquired an unhappy influence on our public affairs. But &s;uch evils, like the wor&s;t of weeds, will natu|rally &s;pring up in &s;o rich a &s;oil; and a good Government is as nece&s;&s;a|ry to &s;ubdue the one, as an attentive gardener or hu&s;bandman is to de|&s;troy the other&mdash;Even the garden of Paradi&s;e required to be dre&s;&s;ed, and while men continue to be con&s;tantly impelled to error and to wrong, by innumerable circum&s;tances and temptations, &s;o long will &s;ociety ex|perience the uncea&s;ing nece&s;&s;ity of Government.</P>
<P>It is a pity that the expectations which actuated the authors of the exi&s;ting Confederation, neither have nor can be realized:&mdash;accu&s;tomed to &s;ee and admire the glorious &s;pirit which moved all ranks of people in the mo&s;t gloomy moments of the war, ob&s;erving their &s;teadfa&s;t at|tachment to Union, and the wi&s;dom they &s;o often manife&s;ted both in choo&s;ing and confiding in their rulers, tho&s;e gentlemen were led to flat|ter them&s;elves that the people of America only required to know what ought to be done, to do it. This amiable mi&s;take induced them to in&s;titute a national Government in &s;uch a manner, as though very fit to give advice, was yet de&s;titute of power, and &s;o con&s;tructed as to be very unfit to be tru&s;ted with it. They &s;eem not to have been &s;en&s;ible that mere advice is a &s;ad &s;ub&s;titute for laws; nor to have recollected that the advice even of the all-wi&s;e and be&s;t of Beings, has been always di&s;regarded by a great majority of all the men that ever lived.</P>
<P>Experience is a &s;evere preceptor, but it teaches u&s;eful truths, and however har&s;h, is always hone&s;t&mdash;Be calm and di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate, and li&s;ten to what it tells us.</P>
<P>Prior to the revolution we had little occa&s;ion to enquire or know much about national affairs, for although they exi&s;ted and were managed, yet they were managed <HI>for</HI> us, but not <HI>by</HI> us. Intent on our dome&s;tic concerns, our internal legi&s;lative bu&s;ine&s;s, our agriculture, and our buying and &s;elling, we were &s;eldom anxious about what pa&s;&s;ed or was
<PB N="6" REF="021175_0005_0FB2705A5645FB08">
doing in foreign Courts. As we had nothing to do with that department of policy, &s;o the affairs of it were not detailed to us, and we took as little pains to inform our&s;elves, as others did to inform us of them. War, and peace, alliances, and treaties, and commerce, and navigation, were con|ducted and regulated without our advice or controul. While we had liberty and ju&s;tice, and in &s;ecurity enjoyed the fruits of our "vine and fig tree," we were in general too content and too much occupied, to be at the trouble of inve&s;tigating the various political combinations in this department, or to examine and perceive how exceedingly impor|tant they often were to the advancement and protection of our pro&s;pe|rity. This habit and turn of thinking affords one rea&s;on why &s;o much more care was taken, and &s;o much more wi&s;dom di&s;played, in forming our State Governments, than in forming our foederal or national one.</P>
<P>By the Confederation as it now &s;tands, the direction of general and national affairs is committed to a &s;ingle body of men, viz. the Con|gre&s;s. They may make war, but are not empowered to rai&s;e men or mo|ney to carry it on&mdash;They may make peace, but without power to &s;ee the terms of it ob&s;erved&mdash;They may form alliances, but without abili|ty to comply with the &s;tipulations on their part&mdash;They may enter into treaties of commerce, but without power to inforce them at home or abroad&mdash;They may borrow money, but without having the means of re|payment&mdash;They may partly regulate commerce, but without authority to execute their ordinances&mdash;They may appoint mini&s;ters and other officers of tru&s;t, but without power to try or puni&s;h them for mi&s;demea|nors&mdash;They may re&s;olve, but cannot execute either with di&s;patch or with &s;ecrecy&mdash;In &s;hort, they may con&s;ult, and deliberate, and recom|mend, and make requi&s;itions, and they who plea&s;e may regard them.</P>
<P>From this new and wonderful &s;y&s;tem of Government, it has come to pa&s;s, that almo&s;t every national object of every kind, is at this day unprovided for; and other nations taking the advantage of its imbeci|lity, are daily multiplying commercial re&s;traints upon us. Our fur trade is gone to Canada, and Briti&s;h garri&s;ons keep the keys of it. Our &s;hip-yards have almo&s;t cea&s;ed to di&s;turb the repo&s;e of the neigh|bourhood by the noi&s;e of the axe and hammer; and while foreign flags fly triumphantly above our highe&s;t hou&s;es, the American Stars &s;eldom do more than &s;hed a few feeble rays about the humbler ma&s;ts of river &s;loops and coa&s;ting &s;chooners. The greater part of our hardy &s;eamen
<PB N="7" REF="021175_0006_0FB2705BD1663170">
are plowing the ocean in foreign pay; and not a few of our ingenious &s;hipwrights are now building ve&s;&s;els on alien &s;hores. Although our in|crea&s;ing agriculture and indu&s;try extend and multiply our productions, yet they con&s;tantly dimini&s;h in value; and although we permit all na|tions to fill our country with their merchandizes, yet their be&s;t mar|kets are &s;hut again&s;t us. Is there an Engli&s;h, or a French, or a Spani&s;h i&s;land or port in the We&s;t-Indies to which an American ve&s;&s;el can carry a cargo of flour for &s;ale? Not one. The Algerines ex|clude us from the Mediterranean, and adjacent countries; and we are neither able to purcha&s;e, nor to command the free u&s;e of tho&s;e &s;eas. Can our little towns or larger cities con&s;ume the immen&s;e productions of our fertile country? or will they without trade be able to pay a good price for the proportion which they do con&s;ume? The la&s;t &s;ea&s;on gave a very unequivocal an&s;wer to tho&s;e que&s;tions&mdash;What numbers of fine cattle have returned from this city to the country for want of buyers? What great quantities of &s;alted and other provi&s;ions &s;till lay u&s;ele&s;s in the &s;tores? To how much below the former price, is our corn and wheat and flour and lumber rapidly falling? Our debts remain undi|mini&s;hed, and the intere&s;t on them accumulating&mdash;our credit abroad is nearly extingui&s;hed, and at home unre&s;tored&mdash;they who had money have &s;ent it beyond the reach of our laws, and &s;carcely any man can borrow of his neighbour. Nay, does not experience al&s;o tell us, that it is as difficult to pay as to borrow? That even our hou&s;es and lands cannot command money&mdash;that law &s;uits and u&s;urious contracts abound &mdash;that our farms &s;ell on executions for le&s;s than half their value, and that di&s;tre&s;s in various forms, and in various ways, is approaching fa&s;t to the doors of our be&s;t citizens.</P>
<P>The&s;e things have been gradually coming upon us ever &s;ince the peace&mdash;they have been perceived and proclaimed, but the univer&s;al rage and pur&s;uit of private gain con&s;pired with other cau&s;es, to prevent any proper efforts being made to meliorate our condition by due atten|tion to our national affairs, until the late Convention was convened for that purpo&s;e. From the re&s;ult of their deliberations, the States ex|pected to derive much good, and &s;hould they be di&s;appointed, it will probably be not le&s;s their misfortune than their fault. That Conven|tion was in general compo&s;ed of excellent and tried men&mdash;men who had become con&s;picuous for their wi&s;dom and public &s;ervices, and who&s;e names
<PB N="8" REF="021175_0007_0FB2705D5E3ECC40">
and characters will be venerated by po&s;terity. Generous and candid minds cannot perceive without pain, the illiberal manner in which &s;ome have taken the liberty to treat them; nor forbear to impute it to impure and improper motives&mdash;zeal for public good, like zeal for religion, may &s;ometimes carry men beyond the bounds of rea&s;on, but it is not conceivable, that on this occa&s;ion, it &s;hould find means &s;o to enebriate any <HI>candid</HI> American, as to make him forget what he owed to truth and to decency, or induce him either to believe or to &s;ay, that the almo&s;t unanimous advice of the Convention, proceeded from a wicked combination and con&s;piracy a|gain&s;t the liberties of their country. This is not the temper with which we &s;hould receive and con&s;ider their recommendations, nor the treat|ment that would be worthy either of us or of them. Let us continue careful therefore that facts do not warrant hi&s;torians to tell future generations, that envy, malice and uncharitablene&s;s pur&s;ued our pa|triotic benefactors to their graves, and that not even pre-eminence in virtue, nor lives devoted to the public, could &s;hield them from oblo|quy and detraction. On the contrary, let our bo&s;oms always retain a &s;ufficient degree of hone&s;t indignation to di&s;appoint and di&s;courage tho&s;e who expect our thanks or applau&s;e for calumniating our mo&s;t faithful and meritorious friends.</P>
<P>The Convention concurred in opinion with the people, that a na|tional government <HI>competent to every national object,</HI> was indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary; and it was as plain to them, as it now is to all America, that the pre&s;ent confederation does not provide for &s;uch a government. The&s;e points being agreed, they proceeded to con&s;ider how and in what manner &s;uch a Government could be formed, as on the one hand &s;hould be &s;ufficiently energetic to rai&s;e us from our pro&s;trate and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed &s;i|tuation, and on the other be perfectly con&s;i&s;tent with the liberties of the people of every State. Like men to whom the experience of other ages and countries had taught wi&s;dom, they not only determined that it &s;hould be erected by, and depend on the people; but remembering the many in&s;tances in which Governments ve&s;ted &s;olely in one man, or one body of men, had degenerated into tyrannies, they judged it mo&s;t prudent that the three great branches of power &s;hould be committed to different hands, and therefore that the executive &s;hould be &s;eparated from the legi&s;lative, and the judicial from both. Thus far the propriety of their work is ea&s;ily &s;een and under&s;tood, and therefore is thus far <HI>almo&s;t</HI> uni|ver&s;ally
<PB N="9" REF="021175_0008_0FB2705F00210520">
approved&mdash;for no one man or thing under the &s;un ever yet plea&s;ed every body.</P>
<P>The next que&s;tion was, what particular powers &s;hould be given to the&s;e three branches? Here the different views and intere&s;ts of the different States, as well as the different ab&s;tract opinions of their mem|bers on &s;uch points, interpo&s;ed many difficulties. Here the bu&s;ine&s;s became complicated, and pre&s;ented a wide field for inve&s;tigation; too wide for every eye to take a quick and comprehensive view of it.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid that "in a multitude of coun&s;ellors there is &s;afety," becau&s;e in the fir&s;t place, there is greater &s;ecurity for probity; and in the next, if every member ca&s;ts in only his mite of information and argument, their joint &s;tock of both will thereby become greater than the &s;tock po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by any one &s;ingle man out of doors. Gentlemen out of doors therefore &s;hould not be ha&s;ty in condemning a &s;y&s;tem, which probably re&s;ts on more good rea&s;ons than they are aware of, e&s;pecially when formed under &s;uch advantages, and recommended by &s;o many men of di&s;tingui&s;hed worth and abilities.</P>
<P>The difficulties before mentioned occupied the Convention a long time, and it was not without mutual conce&s;&s;ions that they were at la&s;t &s;urmounted. The&s;e conce&s;&s;ions &s;erve to explain to us the rea&s;on why &s;ome parts of the &s;y&s;tem plea&s;e in &s;ome States, which di&s;plea&s;e in others; and why many of the objections which have been made to it, are &s;o contradictory and incon&s;i&s;tent with one another. It does great credit to the temper and talents of the Convention, that they were able &s;o to reconcile the different views and intere&s;ts of the different States, and the cla&s;hing opinions of their members, as to unite with &s;uch &s;ingular and almo&s;t perfect unanimity in any plan whatever, on a &s;ub|ject &s;o intricate and perplexed. It &s;hews that it mu&s;t have been tho|roughly di&s;cu&s;&s;ed and under&s;tood; and probably if the community at large had the &s;ame lights and rea&s;ons before them, they would, if equal|ly candid and uninfluenced, be equally unanimous.</P>
<P>It would be arduous, and indeed impo&s;&s;ible to comprize within the limits of this addre&s;s, a full di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of every part of the plan. Such a ta&s;k would require a volume, and few men have lei&s;ure or inclination to read volumes on any &s;ubject. The objections made to it are almo&s;t without number, and many of them without rea&s;on&mdash;&s;ome of them are real and hone&s;t, and others merely o&s;ten&s;ible. There are friends to
<PB N="10" REF="021175_0009_0FB270634EA8F5D0">
Union and a national Government who have &s;erious doubts, who wi&s;h to be informed, and to be convinced; and there are others who, neither wi&s;hing for Union nor any national Government at all, will oppo&s;e and object to any plan that can be contrived.</P>
<P>We are told, among other &s;trange things, that the liberty of the pre&s;s is left in&s;ecure by the propo&s;ed Con&s;titution, and yet that Con&s;ti|tution &s;ays neither more nor le&s;s about it, than the Con&s;titution of the State of New-York does. We are told that it deprives us of trial by jury, whereas the fact is, that it expre&s;ly &s;ecures it in certain ca&s;es, and takes it away in none&mdash;it is ab&s;urd to con&s;true the &s;ilence of this, or of our own Con&s;titution, relative to a great number of our rights, into a to|tal extinction of them&mdash;&s;ilence and blank paper neither grant nor take away any thing. Complaints are al&s;o made that the propo&s;ed Con&s;titu|tion is not accompanied by a bill of rights; and yet they who make the&s;e complaints, know and are content that no bill of rights accompa|nied the Con&s;titution of this State. In days and countries where Mo|narchs and their &s;ubjects were frequently di&s;puting about prerogative and privileges, the latter often found it nece&s;&s;ary, as it were to run out the line between them, and oblige the former to admit by &s;olemn acts, called bills of rights, that certain enumerated rights belonged to the people, and were not comprehended in the royal prerogative. But thank God we have no &s;uch di&s;putes&mdash;we have no Monarchs to con|tend with, or demand admi&s;&s;ions from&mdash;the propo&s;ed Government is to be the government of the people&mdash;all its officers are to be their officers, and to exerci&s;e no rights but &s;uch as the people commit to them. The Con&s;titution only &s;erves to point out that part of the people's bu&s;ine&s;s, which they think proper by it to refer to the management of the per|&s;ons therein de&s;ignated&mdash;tho&s;e per&s;ons are to receive that bu&s;ine&s;s to manage, not for them&s;elves, and as their own, but as agents and over|&s;eers for the people to whom they are con&s;tantly re&s;pon&s;ible, and by whom only they are to be appointed.</P>
<P>But the de&s;ign of this addre&s;s is not to inve&s;tigate the merits of the plan, nor of the objections made to it. They who &s;eriou&s;ly contemplate the pre&s;ent &s;tate of our affairs will be convinced that other con&s;iderations of at lea&s;t equal importance demand their attention. Let it be admit|ted that this plan, like everything el&s;e devi&s;ed by man, has its imperfec|tions; That it does not plea&s;e every body is certain, and there is little
<PB N="11" REF="021175_0010_0FB27069B400B2C8">
rea&s;on to expect one that will. It is a que&s;tion of great moment to you, whether the probability of our being able &s;ea&s;onably to obtain a better, is &s;uch as to render it prudent and advi&s;able to reject this, and run the ri&s;que.&mdash;Candidly to con&s;ider this que&s;tion is the de&s;ign of this addre&s;s.</P>
<P>As the importance of this que&s;tion mu&s;t be obvious to every man, whatever his private opinions re&s;pecting it may be, it becomes us all to treat it in that calm and temperate manner, which a &s;ubject &s;o deeply intere&s;ting to the future welfare of our country and po&s;terity requires. Let us therefore as much as po&s;&s;ible repre&s;s and compo&s;e that irritation in our minds, which too warm di&s;putes about it may have excited. Let us endeavor to forget that this or that man, is on this or that &s;ide; and that we our&s;elves, perhaps without &s;ufficient reflection, have cla&s;&s;ed our|&s;elves with one or the other party. Let us remember that this is not to be regarded as a matter that only touches our local parties, but as one &s;o great, &s;o general, and &s;o exten&s;ive in its future con&s;equences to America, that for our deciding upon it according to the be&s;t of our un|bia&s;&s;ed judgment, we mu&s;t be highly re&s;pon&s;ible both here and hereafter.</P>
<P>The que&s;tion now before us naturally leads to <HI>three</HI> enquiries:
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. Whether it is probable that a better plan can be obtained?</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Whether, if attainable, it is likely to be in &s;ea&s;on?</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. What would be our &s;ituation, if after rejecting this, all our ef|forts to obtain a better &s;hould prove fruitle&s;s?</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>The men who formed this plan are Americans, who had long de|&s;erved and enjoyed our confidence, and who are as much intere&s;ted in having a good government as any of us are, or can be. They were ap|pointed to that bu&s;ine&s;s at a time when the States had become very &s;en&s;ible of the derangement of our national affairs, and of the impo&s;&s;i|bility of retrieving them under the exi&s;ting Confederation. Although well per&s;uaded that nothing but a good national Government could op|po&s;e and divert the tide of evils that was flowing in upon us, yet tho&s;e gentlemen met in Convention with minds perfectly unprejudiced in fa|vor of any particular plan. The minds of their Con&s;tituents were at that time equally unbia&s;&s;ed, equally cool and di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate. All agreed in the nece&s;&s;ity of doing &s;omething, but no one ventured to &s;ay deci|dedly what preci&s;ely ought to be done&mdash;opinions were then fluctuating and unfixed, and whatever might have been the wi&s;hes of a few indi|viduals, yet while the Convention deliberated, the people remained in

&s;ilent &s;u&s;pence. Neither wedded to favorite &s;y&s;tems of their own, nor influenced by popular ones abroad, the members were more de&s;irous to receive light from, than to impre&s;s their private &s;entiments on one another. The&s;e circum&s;tances naturally opened the door to that &s;pirit of candor, of calm enquiry, of mutual accommodation, and mutual re&s;pect, which entered into the Convention with them, and regulated their debates and proceedings.</P>
<P>The impo&s;&s;ibility of agreeing upon any plan that would exactly qua|drate with the local policy and objects of every State, &s;oon became evi|dent; and they wi&s;ely thought it better mutually to concede, and ac|commodate, and in that way to fa&s;hion their &s;y&s;tem as much as po&s;&s;ible by the circum&s;tances and wi&s;hes of the different States, than by perti|naciou&s;ly adhering, each to his own ideas, oblige the Convention to ri&s;e without doing any thing. They were &s;en&s;ible that ob&s;tacles ari&s;ing from local circum&s;tances, would not cea&s;e while tho&s;e circum&s;tances conti|nue to exi&s;t; and &s;o far as tho&s;e circum&s;tances depended on differences of climate, productions, and commerce, that no change was to be expected. They were likewi&s;e &s;en&s;ible that on a &s;ubject &s;o comprehen&s;ive, and in|volving &s;uch a variety of points and que&s;tions, the mo&s;t able, the mo&s;t candid, and the mo&s;t hone&s;t men will differ in opinion. The &s;ame propo&s;ition &s;eldom &s;trikes many minds exactly in the &s;ame point or light: different habits of thinking, different degrees and modes of edu|cation, different prejudices and opinions early formed and long enter|tained, con&s;pire with a multitude of other circum&s;tances, to produce among men a diver&s;ity and contrariety of opinions on que&s;tions of diffi|culty. Liberality therefore as well as prudence, induced them to treat each other's opinions with tenderne&s;s, to argue without a&s;perity, and to endeavor to convince the judgment without hurting the feelings of each other. Although many weeks were pa&s;&s;ed in the&s;e di&s;cu&s;&s;ions, &s;ome points remained, on which a uni&s;on of opinions could not be effected. Here again that &s;ame happy di&s;po&s;ition to unite and conciliate, induced them to meet each other; and enabled them by mutual conce&s;&s;ions, fi|nally to compleat and agree to the plan they have recommended, and that too with a degree of unanimity, which, con&s;idering the variety of di&s;cordant views and ideas they had to reconcile, is really a&s;toni&s;hing.</P>
<P>They tell us very hone&s;tly that this plan is the re&s;ult of accommoda|tion&mdash;they do not hold it up as the be&s;t of all po&s;&s;ible ones, but only
<PB N="13" REF="021175_0012_0FB2706E925E9360">
as the be&s;t which they could unite in, and agree to. If &s;uch men, ap|pointed and meeting under &s;uch au&s;picious circum&s;tances, and &s;o &s;in|cerely di&s;po&s;ed to conciliation, could go no further in their endeavors to plea&s;e every State and every body, what rea&s;on have we at pre&s;ent to expect any &s;y&s;tem that would give more general &s;atisfaction?</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e this plan to be rejected, what mea&s;ures would you propo&s;e for obtaining a better? Some will an&s;wer, let us appoint another Con|vention, and as every thing has been &s;aid and written, that can well be &s;aid and written on the &s;ubject, they will be better informed than the former one was, and con&s;equently be better able to make and agree upon a more eligible one.</P>
<P>This rea&s;oning is fair, and as far as it goes has weight; but it ne|verthele&s;s takes one thing for granted, which appears very doubtful; for although the new Convention might have more information, and perhaps equal abilities, yet it does not from thence follow that they would be equally <HI>di&s;po&s;ed to agree.</HI> The contrary of this po&s;ition is the mo&s;t probable. You mu&s;t have ob&s;erved that the &s;ame temper and equanimity which prevailed among the people on the former occa&s;ion, no longer exi&s;ts. We have unhappily become divided into parties, and this important &s;ubject has been handled with &s;uch indi&s;creet and offen|&s;ive acrimony, and with &s;o many little unhand&s;ome artifices and mi&s;re|pre&s;entations, that pernicious heats and animo&s;ities have been kindled, and &s;pread their flames far and wide among us. When therefore it be|comes a que&s;tion who &s;hall be deputed to the new Convention; we can|not flatter our&s;elves that the talents and integrity of the candidates will determine who &s;hall be elected. Foederal electors will vote for foede|ral deputies, and anti-foederal electors for anti-foederal ones. Nor will either party prefer the mo&s;t moderate of their adherents, for as the mo&s;t &s;taunch and active partizans will be the mo&s;t popular, &s;o the men mo&s;t willing and able to carry points, to oppo&s;e, and divide, and embarra&s;s their opponents will be cho&s;en. A Convention formed at &s;uch a &s;ea|&s;on, and of &s;uch men, would be but too exact an epitome of the great body that named them. The &s;ame party views, the &s;ame propen&s;ity to oppo&s;ition, the &s;ame di&s;tru&s;ts and jealou&s;ies, and the &s;ame unaccomodat|ing &s;pirit which prevail without, would be concentred and ferment with &s;till greater violence within. Each deputy would recollect <HI>who</HI> &s;ent
<PB N="14" REF="021175_0013_0FB270731DAFA3D0">
him, and <HI>why</HI> he was &s;ent; and be too apt to con&s;ider him&s;elf bound in honor, to contend and act vigorou&s;ly under the &s;tandard of his party, and not hazard their di&s;plea&s;ure by preferring compromi&s;e to victory. As vice does not &s;ow the &s;eeds of virtue, &s;o neither does pa&s;&s;ion culti|vate the fruits of rea&s;on. Su&s;picions and re&s;entments create no di&s;po&s;i|tion to conciliate, nor do they infu&s;e a de&s;ire of making partial and per|&s;onal objects bend to general union and the common good. The ut|mo&s;t efforts of that excellent di&s;po&s;ition were nece&s;&s;ary to enable the late Convention to perform their ta&s;k; and although contrary cau&s;es &s;ometimes operate &s;imilar effects, yet to expect that di&s;cord and animo|&s;ity &s;hould produce the fruits of confidence and agreement, is to expect "grapes from thorns, and figs from thi&s;tles."</P>
<P>The States of Georgia, Delaware, Jer&s;ey and Connecticut, have adopted the pre&s;ent plan with unexampled unanimity; they are content with it as it is, and con&s;equently their deputies, being apprized of the &s;entiments of their Con&s;tituents, will be little inclined to make alterati|ons, and cannot be otherwi&s;e than aver&s;e to changes which they have no rea&s;on to think would be agreeable to their people&mdash;&s;ome other States, tho' le&s;s unanimous, have neverthele&s;s adopted it by very re|&s;pectable majorities; and for rea&s;ons &s;o evidently cogent, that even the minority in one of them, have nobly pledged them&s;elves for its pro|motion and &s;upport. From the&s;e circum&s;tances the new Convention would derive and experience difficulties unknown to the former. Nor are the&s;e the only additional difficulties they would have to encounter. Few are ignorant that there has lately &s;prung up a &s;ect of politicians who teach and profe&s;s to believe, that the extent of our nation is too great for the &s;uperintendance of one national Government, and on that principle argue that it ought to be divided into two or three. This doctrine, however mi&s;chievous in its tendency and con&s;equences, has its advocates, and &s;hould any of them be &s;ent to the Convention, it will naturally be their policy rather to cheri&s;h than to prevent divi&s;ions: for well knowing that the in&s;titution of any good national Government, would bla&s;t their favorite &s;y&s;tem, no mea&s;ures that lead to it can meet with their aid or approbation.</P>
<P>Nor can we be certain whether or not any and what foreign influence would, on &s;uch an occa&s;ion, be indirectly exerted, nor for what pur|po&s;es&mdash;delicacy forbids an ample di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of this que&s;tion. Thus
<PB N="15" REF="021175_0014_0FB2707557606BB8">
much may be &s;aid without error or offence, viz. That &s;uch foreign nations as de&s;ire the pro&s;perity of America, and would rejoice to &s;ee her become great and powerful, under the au&s;pices of a Government wi&s;e|ly calculated to extend her commerce, to encourage her navigation and marine, and to direct the whole weight of her power and re&s;ources as her intere&s;t and honor may require, will doubtle&s;s be friendly to the Union of the States, and to the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a Government able to perpetuate, protect and dignify it.&mdash;Such other foreign nations, if any &s;uch there be, who, jealous of our growing importance, and fearful that our commerce and navigation &s;hould impair their own&mdash;who behold our rapid population with regret, and apprehend that the enterprizing &s;pirit of our people, when &s;econded by power and probability of &s;ucce&s;s, may be directed to objects not con&s;i&s;tent with their policy or intere&s;t, cannot fail at lea&s;t to wi&s;h that we may continue a weak and a divided people.</P>
<P>The&s;e con&s;iderations merit much attention, and candid men will judge how far they render it probable that a new Convention would be able either to agree in a better plan, or with tolerable unanimity, in any plan at all. Any plan forcibly carried by a &s;lender majority, mu&s;t expect numerous opponents among the people, who, e&s;pecially in their pre&s;ent temper, would be more inclined to reject than adopt any &s;y&s;tem &s;o made and carried. We &s;hould in &s;uch a ca&s;e again &s;ee the pre&s;s teem|ing with publications for and again&s;t it; for as the minority would take pains to ju&s;tify their di&s;&s;ent, &s;o would the majority be indu&s;trious to di&s;play the wi&s;dom of their proceedings. Hence new divi&s;ions, new parties, and new di&s;tractions would en&s;ue, and no one can fore&s;ee or conjecture when or how they would terminate.</P>
<P>Let tho&s;e who are &s;anguine in their expectations of a better plan from a new Convention, al&s;o reflect on the delays and ri&s;ques to which it would expo&s;e us. Let them con&s;ider whether we ought, by continuing much longer in our pre&s;ent humiliated condition, to give other nations further time to perfect their re&s;trictive &s;y&s;tems of commerce, to reconcile their own people to them, and to fence and guard and &s;trengthen them by all tho&s;e regulations and contrivances in which a jealous policy is ever fruitful. Let them con&s;ider whether we ought to give further oppor|tunities to di&s;cord to alienate the hearts of our citizens from one another, and thereby encourage new Cromwells to bold exploits. Are we cer|tain
<PB N="16" REF="021175_0015_0FB2707784FB19C8">
that our foreign creditors will continue patient, and ready to pro|portion their forbearance to our delays? Are we &s;ure that our di&s;tre&s;&s;es, di&s;&s;entions and weakne&s;s will neither invite ho&s;tility nor in&s;ult? If they &s;hould, how ill prepared &s;hall we be for defence! without Union, with|out Government, without money, and without credit!</P>
<P>It &s;eems unnece&s;&s;ary to remind you, that &s;ome time mu&s;t yet elap&s;e, before all the States will have decided on the pre&s;ent plan. If they re|ject it, &s;ome time mu&s;t al&s;o pa&s;s before the mea&s;ure of a new Conven|tion, can be brought about and generally agreed to. A further &s;pace of time will then be requi&s;ite to elect their deputies, and &s;end them on to Convention. What time they may expend when met, cannot be divined, and it is equally uncertain how much time the &s;everal States may take to deliberate and decide on any plan they may recommend&mdash; if adopted, &s;till a further &s;pace of time will be nece&s;&s;ary to organize and &s;et it in motion:&mdash;In the mean time our affairs are daily going on from bad to wor&s;e, and it is not ra&s;h to &s;ay that our di&s;tre&s;&s;es are accumu|lating like compound intere&s;t.</P>
<P>But if for the rea&s;ons already mentioned, and others that we cannot now perceive, the new Convention, in&s;tead of producing a better plan, &s;hould give us only a hi&s;tory of their di&s;putes, or &s;hould offer us one &s;till le&s;s plea&s;ing than the pre&s;ent, where &s;hould we be then? The old Confederation has done its be&s;t, and cannot help us; and is now &s;o re|laxed and feeble, that in all probability it would not &s;urvive &s;o violent a &s;hock. Then "to your tents Oh I&s;rael!" would be the word. Then every band of Union would be &s;evered. Then every State would be a little nation, jealous of its neighbours, and anxious to &s;trengthen it&s;elf by foreign alliances, again&s;t its former friends. Then farewell to fra|ternal affection, un&s;u&s;pecting intercour&s;e, and mutual participation in commerce, navigation and citizen&s;hip. Then would ari&s;e mutual re|&s;trictions and fears, mutual garri&s;ons,&mdash;and &s;tanding armies, and all tho&s;e dreadful evils which for &s;o many ages plagued England, Scot|land, Wales and Ireland, while they continued di&s;united, and were played off again&s;t each other.</P>
<P>Con&s;ider my fellow citizens what you are about, before it is too late &mdash;con&s;ider what in &s;uch an event would be your particular ca&s;e.&mdash;You know the geography of your State, and the con&s;equences of your local po&s;ition. Jer&s;ey and Connecticut, to whom your impo&s;t laws have been
<PB N="17" REF="021175_0016_0FB270784D2D61F0">
unkind&mdash;Jer&s;ey and Connecticut, who have adopted the pre&s;ent plan, and expect much good from it, will impute its mi&s;carriage and all the con&s;equent evils to you. They now con&s;ider your oppo&s;ition as dic|tated more by your fondne&s;s for your impo&s;t, than for tho&s;e rights to which they have never been behind you in attachment. They cannot, they will not love you&mdash;they border upon you, and are your neighbours, but you will &s;oon cea&s;e to regard their neighbourhood as a ble&s;&s;ing. You have but one port and outlet to your commerce, and how you are to keep that outlet free and uninterrupted, merits con&s;ideration.&mdash; What advantages Vermont in combination with others, might take of you, may ea&s;ily be conjectured; nor will you be at a lo&s;s to perceive how much rea&s;on the people of Long-I&s;land, whom you cannot protect, have to deprecate being con&s;tantly expo&s;ed to the depredations of every invader.</P>
<P>The&s;e are &s;hort hints&mdash;they ought not to be more developed&mdash;you can ea&s;ily in your own minds dilate and trace them through all their relative circum&s;tances and connections.&mdash;Pau&s;e then for a moment, and reflect whether the matters you are di&s;puting about, are of &s;uffici|ent moment to ju&s;tify your running &s;uch extravagant ri&s;ques. Reflect that the pre&s;ent plan comes recommended to you by men and fellow-citizens, who have given you the highe&s;t proofs that men can give, of their ju&s;tice, their love for liberty and their country, of their prudence, of their application, and of their talents. They tell you it is the be&s;t that they could form; and that in their opinion, it is nece&s;&s;ary to re|deem you from tho&s;e calamities which already begin to be heavy upon us all. You find that not only tho&s;e men, but others of &s;imilar cha|racters, and of whom you have al&s;o had very ample experience, advi&s;e you to adopt it. You find that whole States concur in the &s;entiment, and among them are your next neighbours; both of whom have &s;hed much blood in the cau&s;e of liberty, and have manife&s;ted as &s;trong and con&s;tant a predilection for a free Republican Government as any States in the Union, and perhaps in the world. They perceive not tho&s;e la|tent mi&s;chiefs in it, with which &s;ome double-&s;ighted politicians endea|vor to alarm you. You cannot but be &s;en&s;ible that this plan or Con|&s;titution will always be in the hands and power of the people, and that
<PB N="18" REF="021175_0017_0FB27079CCEB28D0">
if on experiment, it &s;hould be found defective or incompetent, they may either remedy its defects, or &s;ub&s;titute another in its room. The objec|tionable parts of it are certainly very que&s;tionable, for otherwi&s;e there would not be &s;uch a contrariety of opinions about them. Experience will better determine &s;uch que&s;tions than theoretical arguments, and &s;o far as the danger of abu&s;es is urged again&s;t the in&s;titution of a Govern|ment, remember that a power to do good always involves a power to do harm. We mu&s;t in the bu&s;ine&s;s of Government as well as in all other bu&s;ine&s;s, have &s;ome degree of confidence, as well as a great degree of caution. Who on a &s;ick bed would refu&s;e medicines from a phy&s;i|cian, merely becau&s;e it is as much in his power to admini&s;ter deadly poi|&s;ons, as &s;alutary remedies.</P>
<P>You cannot be certain, that by rejecting the propo&s;ed plan you would not place your&s;elves in a very awkward &s;ituation. Suppo&s;e nine States &s;hould neverthele&s;s adopt it, would you not in that ca&s;e be obliged either to &s;eparate from the Union, or re&s;cind your di&s;&s;ent? The fir&s;t would not be eligible, nor could the latter be plea&s;ant&mdash;A mere hint is &s;uffici|ent on this topic&mdash;You cannot but be aware of the con&s;equences.</P>
<P>Con&s;ider then, how weighty and how many con&s;iderations advi&s;e and per&s;uade the People of America to remain in the &s;afe and ea&s;y path of Union; to continue to move and act as they hitherto have done, as a <HI>Band of Brothers</HI>; to have confidence in them&s;elves and in one another; and &s;ince all cannot &s;ee with the &s;ame eyes, at lea&s;t to give the propo&s;ed Con&s;titution a fair trial, and to mend it as time, occa&s;ion and experi|ence may dictate. It would little become us to verify the predictions of tho&s;e who ventured to prophecy, that <HI>Peace,</HI> in&s;tead of ble&s;&s;ing us with happine&s;s and tranquility, would &s;erve only as the &s;ignal for facti|ons, di&s;cords and civil contentions to rage in our land, and overwhelm it with mi&s;ery and di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>Let us al&s;o be mindful that the cau&s;e of freedom greatly depends on the u&s;e we make of the &s;ingular opportunities we enjoy of governing our&s;elves wi&s;ely; for if the event &s;hould prove, that the people of this
<PB N="19" REF="021175_0018_0FB2707B4FCF4590">
country either cannot or will not govern them&s;elves, who will hereafter be advocates for &s;y&s;tems, which however charming in theory and pro&s;|pect, are not reducible to practice. If the people of our nation, in&s;tead of con&s;enting to be governed by laws of their own making and rulers of their own choo&s;ing, &s;hould let licentiou&s;ne&s;s, di&s;order and confu&s;ion reign over them, the minds of men every where, will in&s;en&s;ibly become alie|nated from republican forms, and prepared to prefer and acquie&s;ce in Governments, which, though le&s;s friendly to liberty, afford more peace and &s;ecurity.</P>
<P><HI>Receive this Addre&s;s with the &s;ame candor with which it is written; and may the &s;pirit of wi&s;dom and patrioti&s;m direct and di&s;tingui&s;h your coun&s;els and your conduct.</HI></P>
