<P>IT is not pretended that any new arguments are advanced in this perform|ance; nor does the author suppose that there is any need of referring to particu|lar books which he has frequently consult|ed, when engaged in studies of this kind. If the reader &s;hould find any of these sen|timents, in the works of <HI>Ditton, West, Lardner, Stackhouse, Doddridge, But|ler,</HI> or other eminent writers, he will there see the same subjects treated with more learning and energy, than in this compendium; which is designed for those who have not leisure or opportunity to look into more voluminous works.</P>

<HEAD>ON THE NATURE OF THAT EVIDENCE BY WHICH THE GOSPEL IS SUPPORTED.</HEAD>
<P>IT has been the fate of many great and illu&s;trious characters, to be mi&s;repre&s;ented; and to have different opinions formed of them by per&s;ons of different parties and prejudices; but there never was a per&s;on on earth who has, for &s;o long a time been a &s;ubject of controver&s;y as JESUS CHRIST. The controver&s;y has a&s;&s;umed various forms, and has been &s;timulated by various pa&s;||&s;ions and intere&s;ts; but it has never been di&s;continued, or, if &s;ilent awhile, it has broken out again from its re|&s;traint.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="028256_0006_0FD847D91247DEE0">The oppo&s;ition to the go&s;pel at this time, appears in a different form from that in the early days of chri&s;tianity. Then the followers of Chri&s;t, were ac|cu&s;ed before magi&s;trates, or in&s;ulted by mobs, or anathematized by &s;ynagogues and councils; now, our per&s;ons are &s;afe, and our religious wor&s;hip is undi&s;|turbed; but we hear our ma&s;ter defamed, and the writers of his life abu&s;ed. The extraordinary facts which they have re|corded, are either repre&s;ented as incre|dible; or made the &s;ubject of profane wit. A &s;pecies of vulgar infidelity, founded partly in pedantry, partly in debauchery and partly in ill manners, is in&s;inuating it&s;elf into the minds of the thoughtle&s;s; and the mo&s;t &s;acred truths are rejected and ridiculed, with|out an examination of their evidence, or a con&s;ideration of their importance.</P>
<P>Among other ebullitions of this &s;pe|cies of infidelity lately pre&s;ented to the "Citizens of America" by a popular writer, I find the following.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Age of rea&s;on&punc; p. 14. American Edition.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="028256_0007_0FD8480B8D3823D8">"THOMAS did not believe the re&s;urrection; and <HI>would</HI> not believe, without having ocular and manual de|mon&s;tration him&s;elf. So neither <HI>will</HI> I; and the rea&s;on is equally as good for me, and for every other per&s;on, as for Thomas."</P>
<P>It is true that Thomas did not believe the report of the re&s;urrection from his brethren; but it is equally true that when he had &s;atisfactory evidence of its truth he did believe it. At the &s;ame time that Je&s;us conde&s;cended to give him all the "ocular and manual demon&s;tra|tion," which it was nece&s;&s;ary for him <HI>as an apo&s;tle</HI> to have, he accompanied the conde&s;cen&s;ion with this memorable declaration. "Thomas, becau&s;e thou ha&s;t <HI>&s;een</HI> me thou ha&s;t believed, ble&s;&s;ed are they who have <HI>not &s;een</HI> and yet have believed."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John 11.29.</NOTE> Plainly giving him to un|der&s;tand that the actual &s;ight which he demanded, and with which he was in|dulged, is not equally nece&s;&s;ary for all,
<PB N="10" REF="028256_0008_0FD847DACD5B2C98">
as for him; but that there may be a true faith without it; that per&s;ons who have not enjoyed it, and who cannot enjoy it, may have &s;uch evidence offered to them as will be a &s;ufficient ground of faith, and give them a title to true ble&s;&s;|edne&s;s. What this evidence is, may be learned from the remark of the evan|gelical hi&s;torian immediately following.</P>
<P><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 30, 31.</NOTE>"Many other &s;igns truly did Je&s;us in the pre&s;ence of his di&s;ciples, which are not written in this book; but the&s;e are written, that ye might believe, that Je&s;us is the Chri&s;t, the Son of God; and that believing, ye might have life, through his name."</P>
<P>Whil&s;t the apo&s;tles lived, their te&s;ti|mony delivered in their public or pri|vate di&s;cour&s;es amounted to credible evidence of this great event; but as they knew them&s;elves to be mortal, they were directed by the &s;ame influence which conducted them through all their evangelical labours to commit to writing
<PB N="11" REF="028256_0009_0FD8480D01F874A0">
&s;uch things as were nece&s;&s;ary to be a proper foundation for faith. Though they did not record every di&s;cour&s;e, or every &s;ign, or action of their ma&s;ter, yea though they might omit &s;ome cir|cum&s;tances of tho&s;e things which they have recorded; yet there is enough written to convince every &s;erious and candid inquirer, that Je&s;us was the Chri&s;t, the Son of God and therefore that there is a &s;ure foundation for the hope of &s;alvation by him.</P>
<P>The go&s;pel, and particularly that capital part of it, the re&s;urrection of Je&s;us, is propo&s;ed to us, not barely as an object of faith; but as containing the hope of eternal life. It is &s;et before us, not merely to be believed as a mat|ter of fact; but to be tru&s;ted in as a mat|ter of importance to us; as that on which our everla&s;ting intere&s;t depends. This is a ju&s;t view of the go&s;pel, and we cannot rightly e&s;timate its value, without taking both the&s;e ideas into the account. For if the go&s;pel, or the re|&s;urrection
<PB N="12" REF="028256_0010_0FD847DC46F8D210">
of Je&s;us, were propo&s;ed mere|ly as an object of belief, without any con&s;ideration of our intere&s;t in it, &s;ome per&s;on might &s;ay, "What is this to me? It may be true, or it may not be true. I have no lei&s;ure for inquiries, but into tho&s;e things with which I have &s;ome concern. I mu&s;t attend to my bu&s;ine&s;s, and leave &s;ubjects of &s;peculative inqui|ry to men who have time and genius to pur&s;ue them." Or, on the other hand, if it were propo&s;ed to us, as a ground of expectation, without any rational evidence of its truth, &s;ome might &s;ay, "How can I entertain hope, without &s;ome evidence which &s;atisfies my mind? I cannot place my expectation, where I can &s;ee no rea&s;on for confidence. My eternal intere&s;t is an object too precious to be committed to any per&s;on as a &s;avi|our, but to one, concerning who&s;e cha|racter and qualifications I can be &s;atisfi|ed on rea&s;onable evidence."</P>
<P>To prevent objections of either kind, the go&s;pel of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and particu|larly
<PB N="13" REF="028256_0011_0FD8481244FD5800">
the doctrine of his re&s;urrection, is propo&s;ed to us in a twofold view; as an object of faith, and therefore &s;upported by proper evidence; and as an object of va&s;t importance to us and therefore de|&s;erving attention. It is an object of &s;o much importance, that if we do not in|quire into its truth with a view to enter|tain the hope which it contains, we are criminal in the highe&s;t degree; and can|not e&s;cape the &s;evere&s;t reprehen&s;ion of our own con&s;cience in a &s;olemn hour. If the go&s;pel be of any importance, it is of the highe&s;t; it not only gives us di|rections for our conduct in this life; but it points the way to immortality. It propo&s;es to us as a mo&s;t &s;erious truth, that this life is but the fir&s;t &s;tage of our exi&s;tence, and that though we mu&s;t die and return to the du&s;t, yet that there &s;hall be a re&s;urrection. It propo&s;es to us immortality, as the reward of well doing; and this immortality is &s;aid to be a &s;tate of the highe&s;t enjoyment which rational beings can expect or de&s;ire; an eternal enjoyment of the chief good,
<PB N="14" REF="028256_0012_0FD847E118752F48">
and an eternally increa&s;ing conformity to God as the ba&s;is of that enjoyment; and the re&s;urrection of Je&s;us &s;hows us in the cleare&s;t light, how we are to ar|rive at this immortality.</P>
<P>Now, what can be of more impor|tance to mankind than &s;uch a doctrine? Is there any higher or nobler truth with which we have any concern? Is there any thing, about which we can or ought to be more &s;olicitous than to &s;ecure our happine&s;s in the future &s;tate? And can we have any &s;atisfaction concerning this mo&s;t important of all con&s;iderations, equal to what is given to us in the go&s;|pel?</P>
<P>As the go&s;pel profe&s;&s;es to have in view our eternal intere&s;t; there is &s;omething to excite our inquiry. We cannot look upon it with indifference; if it be true, it deeply and intimately concerns us. We mu&s;t feel our&s;elves intere&s;ted in the inquiry, whether it be true or not; and this con&s;ideration ought to lead us to a &s;erious and thorough inquiry into that evidence, by which it is &s;upported.
<PB N="15" REF="028256_0013_0FD84813C0D39BE0">
Men will not put them&s;elves to the trouble of inquiry, without &s;ome pro&s;|pect of advantage: They mu&s;t be per|&s;uaded that there is &s;ome good to be ob|tained, before they will enter on any thing which has the appearance of la|bour. He who con&s;tituted our minds knew this; and therefore he has adapt|ed his go&s;pel to our moral con&s;titution: He has propo&s;ed to us, the highe&s;t good to be obtained, by a due regard to the revelation which he has given; that our attention might be excited toward it as a valuable and important object</P>
<P>But he has not only given us a proper motive to make the inquiry; he has al&s;o afforded us &s;uch evidence as is &s;ufficient to convince us of the truth, that is, of &s;uch kind of truth as is thus highly in|tere&s;ting to us. If phy&s;ical truth were the object of our inquiry, we might look for &s;uch kind of evidence as is equal to mathematical demon&s;tration. But our &s;earch is after moral truth, and therefore we mu&s;t admit moral evidence. What I mean, is, that we mu&s;t admit
<PB N="16" REF="028256_0014_0FD847E2A2D000A8">
&s;uch evidence as we do in other ca&s;es, where our intere&s;t is concerned; &s;uch evidence <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> we think it prudent to ad|mit and to depend on in matters which we e&s;teem of great importance to us. Let us take an example.</P>
<P>Let us &s;uppo&s;e, (as mo&s;t people real|ly do) that the acqui&s;ition of wealth is one of the mo&s;t de&s;ireable and impor|tant things in the world; and that it is the part of wi&s;dom to obtain as much riches as we can by our own indu&s;try; and at the &s;ame time, that there is a ne|ce&s;&s;ity of tru&s;ting to other men, for their information and a&s;&s;i&s;tance to accompli&s;h our de&s;ires. Do we not think it ration|al and prudent to put this confidence in them? Do we not depend on their abil|ities, their veracity, their fidelity? And what rea&s;on have we to think it &s;afe for us &s;o to do.?</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e there is a report of a newly di&s;covered country, containing abundant &s;upplies of merchandize, the means of wealth; and that by adventuring our &s;ub&s;tance thither, there is a great pro&s;|pect
<PB N="17" REF="028256_0015_0FD84819D2D620D8">
of advantage; what evidence do we require as a ground of that conduct which is prudent and rational? Mu&s;t we actually &s;ee that country with our own eyes? No. Mu&s;t we &s;ee the per|&s;ons who have been there, and hear the &s;tory from their own mouths? No. Mu&s;t we examine their invoices and count the gains which they have made? No. We content our&s;elves with an in|ferior kind of evidence: We depend on te&s;timony, which we think credible. If there are books or letters written by per&s;ons of proper information and cre|dit, we depend on that evidence: We believe that &s;uch a country exi&s;ts; and that there is &s;uch a way of getting wealth; and we take the mo&s;t prudent methods to obtain it. We put our confidence in &s;uch per&s;ons as are be&s;t acquainted with the bu&s;ine&s;s; and, venture our &s;ub&s;tance on the credit of their abilities and information. Who does not think this, rational and pru|dent conduct?</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="028256_0016_0FD847E3C64C9068">Well, ju&s;t &s;uch kind of evidence is exhibited to us to &s;upport our hope of immortality! Evidence, on which it is rational and prudent to build our expec|tations, and form our conduct. I &s;ay, &s;uch <HI>kind</HI> of evidence, becau&s;e it is the evidence of te&s;timony; but it is much higher in its <HI>degree.</HI> For, the one is &s;ubject to &s;ome deduction, becau&s;e the mo&s;t probable means have &s;ometimes failed: The adventurer has in &s;ome in|&s;tances been di&s;appointed: His confi|dence has been mi&s;placed, or his oppor|tunities lo&s;t: Some accident has inter|vened to bla&s;t his expectations however well grounded; but the other can &s;uffer no deduction from any &s;uch circum|&s;tances: No in&s;tances can be produced, that any have failed of &s;alvation, if they have fought it, in the way pointed out in the go&s;pel; and, therefore, there is no counter evidence to detract from the cre|dibility of the go&s;pel hope. It ought then to have that place in our minds which belongs to the highe&s;t degree of moral evidence. It is &s;aid that "faith<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Heb. xi, 1.</NOTE>
<PB N="19" REF="028256_0017_0FD8481B46C3C408">
is the evidence of things, not &s;een; the &s;ub&s;tance of things hoped for." Here are the &s;ame ideas held out, a pro&s;pect of advantage to be a ground of hope; as well as evidence of truth, to be a ground of faith. Where there is a pro&s;|pect of advantage, and of &s;uch va&s;t un|&s;peakable advantage as the happine&s;s of a future &s;tate; a &s;ubject which has en|gaged the attention of good men in all ages; &s;urely, it is rational to admit that degree of moral evidence, which is founded on credible te&s;timony; on te&s;timony which cannot be contradicted by any te&s;timony of equal credibility; and, from the certainty of which, no de|duction can be made by any rea&s;onable evidence of a contrary truth.</P>
<P>Such is the kind of evidence; and &s;uch is the degree of that kind of evi|dence on which the facts which involve the go&s;pel hope of eternal life are grounded. It is the evidence of te&s;timony; the te&s;timony of Je&s;us Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tles. Je&s;us Chri&s;t came from heaven into this world and pointed out to us the path of life by
<PB N="20" REF="028256_0018_0FD847E54245A658">
his doctrine and example. Having de|livered his te&s;timony and confirmed it by a &s;eries of the mo&s;t wonderful and beneficial works, which were ever &s;een and known in this world; having vo|luntarily yielded him&s;elf to the power of death and &s;ubmitted to be laid in the grave; he hath re&s;umed his life and re|turned to heaven. Of all this, there is &s;ufficient evidence; there is written evi|dence; there is evidence from the writ|ten te&s;timony of credible witne&s;&s;es who could not be mi&s;taken, becau&s;e they did not believe it them&s;elves, until after doubting, they were convined by the mo&s;t infallible and demon&s;trative proof; and who could have no intere&s;t in de|ceiving us, becau&s;e they have ventured their own happine&s;s, on the credibility of the &s;ame truths. If then, we have any idea of the benefit, which is propo&s;|ed to us, by believing in Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and obeying his go&s;pel; if we have any value for that &s;alvation, which is there revealed; ought we not to attend to this evidence? And if it appears rea&s;on|able,
<PB N="21" REF="028256_0019_0FD8481D0B16AB38">
and we have no contrary evidence, to detract from its credibility, is it not wi&s;e and prudent for us to admit the truth of the facts, and the importance of the con&s;equences deducible from them: And when we have admitted it, to build our hope and expectations on it? Ought we not to exerci&s;e the &s;ame judg|ment, and caution on this &s;ubject, which we do every day on things of le&s;s con&s;e|quence? And at the &s;ame time, to place that confidence, and entertain that hope which &s;hall animate us to exertion? Hope is the life of all bu&s;ine&s;s; and what nobler hope can we have than the hope of eternal life? Being per&s;uaded of this truth and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of this hope, we &s;hall pur&s;ue with vigour the path of duty, and the farther we advance in the way of go&s;pel obedience the more com|fort and &s;atisfaction &s;hall we find; "the righteous &s;hall hold on his way and he that hath clean hands &s;hall be &s;tronger and &s;tronger."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Job xvii.9<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"></NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="028256_0020_0FD847E98A259860">If what is &s;aid &s;hould fall into the hands of any who are yet wavering and un&s;ettled in their belief of chri&s;tianity, let me &s;ay to them; that the middle &s;tate you are in, between a full belief of the go&s;pel and a total di&s;belief of it. lays you a &s;trong obligation to pay a &s;trict regard to the evidence by which it is &s;upported.

that conduct, which in other ca&s;es would be thought rational and prudent. You can by no means be excu&s;ed from the duty of making the mo&s;t &s;erious in|quiry. In &s;uch a ca&s;e, negligence is criminal. Indifference will have the &s;ame con&s;equence as actual infidelity. When you have evidence pre&s;ented to you in &s;upport of the mo&s;t momentous truth, and you do not believe it becau&s;e you will not examine it, who mu&s;t bear the blame? When you acknowledge the importance of chri&s;tianity and yet re|main in doubt of its truth, you are guilty of a criminal di&s;regard to your own intere&s;t, and a want of reverence to the authority of your maker, who has a right to require this of you. If chri&s;ti|anity &s;hould finally prove to be true, and you &s;hould be found among tho&s;e who have had a price put into their hands, and have neglected to improve it, what can you expect but the fate of the unprofitable &s;ervant who hid his Lord's talent in the earth?

<HEAD>ON THE INCOMPREHENSIBILITY OF SOME THINGS IN THE SYSTEM OF NATURE; AND ITS ANALOGY, WITH SOME TRUTHS OF DIVINE REVELATlON.</HEAD>
<P>IF the book of nature and the book of &s;cripture be the work of the &s;ame hand, we may expect to find the &s;ame marks and characters in both. A|mong human arti&s;ts, there is a &s;imilari|ty in the &s;tyle and manner of books written by the &s;ame pen, of pictures drawn by the &s;ame pencil, and of build|ings erected by the &s;ame architect. May we not then expect to find in the works of the divine author, a &s;tyle and manner peculiar to him&s;elf? And, if he hath impre&s;&s;ed the peculiar mark of incom|prehen&s;ibility on &s;ome of his works, is

<P>Thus, the incomprehen&s;ibility of GOD is the end of all our inquiries into his works.

<P>May we not al&s;o trace the analogy between the works and <HI>word</HI> of God, and learn the &s;ame mode&s;ty in judging of the latter as of the former? And, if we find the peculiar mark of incompre|hen&s;ibility on &s;ome of the truths which are delivered to us as divine, is it ration|al to reject them on this account? If there were no appearance of this peculiar di&s;tinction, attending the truths which claim a divine original, we might &s;ay, "all this we are able to di&s;cover by our own faculties; we need no divine revela|tion to bring this to our knowledge." But when the revelation is attended with this mark, that &s;ome parts of it are at pre&s;ent impenetrable, how can we con|&s;i&s;tently reject it? Mu&s;t we not for the &s;ame rea&s;on reject all that knowledge of God which is derived from the works of nature? For there are impenetrable depths in both. To be con&s;i&s;tent, therefore, &s;uch per&s;ons mu&s;t join with the fool who &s;aith in his heart "there

<P>By this, it is not meant, that all the truths of God's word are pa&s;t finding out, any more than that all the works of nature are &s;o. There are many things in nature of which we know the u&s;e, though we are ignorant of the cau&s;e; and if we knew the cau&s;e, we &s;hould receive no more benefit from the things them&s;elves than we do now. We know the u&s;e of the magnetic needle and its variation, and can guide our&s;elves through the pathle&s;s ocean, by means of it; though we cannot &s;olve the que&s;|tion, why does it point toward the poles? Or why does it deviate from the true meridian? But if we were to find out the true mechanical cau&s;e of its polarity or its variation, either by the exerci&s;e of our own faculties, or by information from above, what greater benefit could we derive from the needle than we now

They may be found|ed in principles ab&s;tru&s;e and remote from human comprehen&s;ion, and yet may be very u&s;eful and nece&s;&s;ary to us in a practical view; and the te&s;timony which accompanies them may be a &s;ufficient rea&s;on for our belief and practice.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, though they be at pre&s;ent in|comprehen&s;ible to us, that is no rea&s;on why they will always be &s;o.

<P>Of this la&s;t kind is the prediction in Daniel, (chap. ix.24,) re&s;pecting the time of the appearance of the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah,</HI> which limits it to "<HI>&s;eventy weeks,</HI>" from the time when the decree was giv|en, for the re&s;toration of the Jewi&s;h gov|ernment, and the rebuilding of Jeru&s;a|lem, after the expiration of the captivity of the Jews in Babylon.</P>
<P>That &s;uch a per&s;on as the Me&s;&s;iah, was the &s;ubject of many predictions, de|livered to the Jewi&s;h Church, by the mini&s;try of their prophets, is a truth in which both Jews and Chri&s;tians agree. He was predicted under different ti|tles; all of which were expre&s;&s;ive of the dignity of his per&s;on, the characters which he &s;hould a&s;&s;ume, and the bene|fits which he &s;hould confer. He was called the &s;eed of the Woman, the &s;eed of Abraham, in whom all the families

of the earth &s;hould be ble&s;&s;ed, the Son of God, the Son of Man, the Son of David, a prophet like Mo&s;es, a prie&s;t after the order of Melchi&s;edec, a king in Zion, a redeemer, a deliverer, a &s;aviour and the de&s;ire of all nations.</P>
<P>As the time of his advent approached, the predictions became more clear and di&s;tinct; and the &s;eries of prophecy was not clo&s;ed, till he was &s;o particularly de|&s;cribed, and the time of his appearance was &s;o di&s;tinctly fixed, that unle&s;s JESUS CHRIST were the Me&s;&s;iah, no &s;uch per|&s;on has yet appeared in the world.</P>
<P>The name by which he is familiarly known fully expre&s;&s;es the character, in which he appeared; JESUS &s;ignifies <HI>a Saviour,</HI> and CHRIST, <HI>the anointed</HI>; THE ANOINTED SAVIOUR, or the per|&s;on commi&s;&s;ioned by GOD to be the &s;av|iour of the world.</P>
<P>"The ancient Jews were led by their prophecies, as interpreted by them&s;elves, to expect that they would be completed at the <HI>time</HI> in which, the chri&s;tians &s;ay, they were completed; and it was not

<P>In addition to this chronological pre|diction, the coming of the Me&s;&s;iah, is limited by the prophet Haggai, to the time in which the &s;econd temple &s;hould be &s;tanding.

by Solomon, they could not refrain from weeping at the di&s;proportion. Be|&s;ides the gold and other rich furniture, &s;everal things were wanting in the &s;e|cond temple, which were accounted part of the glory of the fir&s;t; viz. the ark of the covenant, the &s;hekinah or vi&s;|ible token of the divine pre&s;ence, the perpetual fire, the &s;acred oil, the Urim and Thummim; but notwith&s;tanding the ab&s;ence of the&s;e, it was predicted by Haggai, [chap. ii.7, 8, 9,] for the con|&s;olation of his countrymen, that "the glory of the latter hou&s;e, &s;hould be great|er than the glory of the former; becau&s;e <HI>the de&s;ire of all nations</HI> &s;hould appear in in it, and by him it would be filled with glory." The&s;e predictions limited the appearance of the Me&s;&s;iah, by the expi|ration of the fifth century, from the re&s;|toration of the Jews, and by the exi&s;t|ence of the temple which they rebuilt after their return from Babylon.

<P>The great difference between tho&s;e of the Jews who rejected Je&s;us, and tho&s;e who received him, was re&s;pecting the nature of that redemption or &s;alva|tion, of which the Me&s;&s;iah was to be the author. The former regarded it in a political &s;en&s;e; they had been redeem|ed from the Egyptian bondage by the mini&s;try of Mo&s;es and Aaron; and from the Babyloni&s;h captivity, by the media|tion of Ezra and Nehemiah; they were then in &s;ubjection to the Romans; and
<PB N="46" REF="028256_0044_0FD84802DF419640">
they looked for the Me&s;&s;iah, as their national redeemer, from that yoke; as one who &s;hould be a temporal prince, like David, and rai&s;e their nation to the &s;ame degree of independence, wealth and honour; but they &s;aw no traits of &s;uch a character in Je&s;us, and therefore rejected him. The latter were induced by various degrees, to overcome the na|tional prejudice, in which they had been educated, and to regard the &s;alvation of the Me&s;&s;iah in a moral and &s;piritual &s;en&s;e; not as re&s;pecting this world but extending to the future ages; not as con|fined to the Jews, but comprehending all mankind. "The Jews in rejecting a &s;piritual &s;en&s;e of tho&s;e prophecies (which yet is admitted by them on other occa&s;ions) have been driven to the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of &s;uppo&s;ing a twofold Me&s;&s;iah, a new conceit, without warrant from their &s;criptures and again&s;t the ideas and expectations of their fathers; the chri&s;|tians by the help of that moral and &s;pi|ritual &s;en&s;e, which they have put on the &s;ame prophecies, are able to explain

<P>The conduct of the ruling part of the Jewi&s;h nation, toward tho&s;e of their brethren who embraced the doctrine of Je&s;us, in the fir&s;t age of the chri&s;tian church &s;hows the force of prejudice over the human mind in a mo&s;t affecting view. They had been &s;ubjected by the Romans; but had expected a Me&s;&s;iah to redeem them, and the time limited by the prophets had elap&s;ed. In&s;tead of being able to recover their own indepen|dence, to &s;ubdue all the nations who had oppre&s;&s;ed them, and to reign as &s;ov|ereigns over the whole earth; they not only continued tributary to the Romans, but &s;aw a number of their own nation, under the full per&s;ua&s;ion that Je&s;us whom they had crucified was the Me&s;|&s;iah, travelling over the world, teach|ing this doctrine, and inviting all men to partake of the ble&s;&s;ings of God's

The Jews were looking for temporal dominion, but the chri&s;tians were expecting no kingdom but what was moral and &s;pirit|ual and would extend to the future in|vi&s;ible world.</P>
<P>The po&s;terity of tho&s;e Jews have liv|ed to &s;ee, not only that they as a nation were never delivered from the Roman yoke; but that the Roman empire,

<HEAD>ON THE CHARACTER OF JESUS CHRIST AND THE WRITERS OF HIS LIFE.</HEAD>
<P>AMIDST the wit and ridicule which have been played off again&s;t chri&s;|tianity, there is &s;ometimes an appear|ance of re&s;pect to the character of Je&s;us Chri&s;t; which, however plau&s;ible at fir&s;t view, yet is accompanied with &s;uch other &s;entiments, as render the &s;incerity of it very que&s;tionable. We are grave|ly told "that &s;uch a per&s;on as Je&s;us Chri&s;t exi&s;ted, and that he was cruci|fied; that he was a virtuous and amiable man; that he preached mo&s;t excellent

<PB N="51" REF="028256_0049_0FD84873C12A5AE8">
which we derive from his death and re&s;urrection.</P>
<P>To expo&s;e the weakne&s;s and incon&s;i&s;t|ency of &s;uch an attack on chri&s;tianity, let us attend to the following con&s;ider|ations.</P>
<P N="1">1. If it be allowed that there was &s;uch a per&s;on as Je&s;us Chri&s;t, that he was virtuous and amiable, that he preach|ed the mo&s;t excellent morality and prac|ti&s;ed the virtues which he taught, from what &s;ource is the knowledge of this derived? How do we know that there was &s;uch a per&s;on, and that his doctrine and life were &s;o good? Mu&s;t not this knowledge be derived from the te&s;ti|mony of ancient authors? And are not tho&s;e authors mo&s;t to be depended on, who were eye witne&s;&s;es of the facts and events of his life, and ear-witne&s;&s;es of the di&s;cour&s;es and in&s;tructions which he delivered? Though &s;omething credible might have been &s;aid by per&s;ons at a di&s;tance who had known him by report and hear&s;ay, who were not his contem|poraries, but had received their know|ledge
<PB N="52" REF="028256_0050_0FD8483E7B6E7E28">
by tradition, and who did not profe&s;s to write his life, nor to be his di&s;ciples and who were far from being particular in their accounts of him; yet, is not greater credit due to tho&s;e who per&s;onally knew him, who fre|quently conver&s;ed with him, and who could not mi&s;take in their te&s;timony concerning him? This is a rule which holds good in all other ca&s;es, and why &s;hould it not be allowed equally good here? We cannot violate this rule with|out &s;uppo&s;ing that the neare&s;t friends of a virtuous and amiable man were the greate&s;t liars; and that tho&s;e who knew him only by a di&s;tant report, were the only hone&s;t and credible hi&s;torians. This &s;uppo&s;ition would not be admitted in any other ca&s;e; becau&s;e it is contrary to the nature of te&s;timony and the rules of evidence univer&s;ally acknowledged among mankind.</P>
<P N="2">2. If Je&s;us Chri&s;t taught the pure&s;t morality and practi&s;ed what he taught, who were more likely to learn of him and to imitate his example than his own
<PB N="53" REF="028256_0051_0FD848780D5C49C0">
di&s;ciples? And would not the morality which they learned of him induce them to &s;peak the truth concerning him? <HI>Socrates</HI> was an eminent teacher of moral philo&s;ophy among the Greeks, but he wrote nothing him&s;elf; <HI>Plato</HI> and <HI>Xenophon</HI> were his di&s;ciples and wrote memorable things concerning him. Doth any per&s;on &s;u&s;pect them of in&s;in|cerity in their relations of their ma&s;ter? Why then &s;hould the di&s;ciples of Je&s;us be le&s;s worthy of credit? What kind of morals can we &s;uppo&s;e they had learned of Je&s;us? What kind of morals do they recommend in their own writings? Do they not enjoin the &s;ame virtues and duties as did their ma&s;ter? and would not candor lead us to &s;up|po&s;e that they practi&s;ed what they taught? Are there not evident marks of &s;implicity and &s;incerity in their writings? Do they not give us the mo&s;t plain and undi&s;gui&s;ed accounts of the actions and &s;ayings of their ma&s;ter? Of their own faults and imperfections? Of their own ab&s;urd rea&s;onings, vain expectations
<PB N="54" REF="028256_0052_0FD84841CDE2C388">
and fal&s;e prejudices, and of the manner in which they were led to correct them? Do they not relate the mo&s;t grand and &s;olemn events, in a &s;tyle as &s;imple and unaffected, as they relate the mo&s;t com|mon occurrences? Do they not plainly &s;how that they had no fondne&s;s for em|belli&s;hing their narratives? But that they aimed only at giving a &s;imple hi&s;tory of &s;uch facts and events as fell under their ob&s;ervation? And, are there any &s;eeming di&s;agreements in their narra|tions but what may be reconciled, by the exerci&s;e of the &s;ame candor which we &s;hould u&s;e in reconciling other wri|ters of equal antiquity, who agree in the mo&s;t material points? Why then are not the di&s;ciples of Je&s;us entitled to our credit in what they have related con|cerning him?</P>
<P N="3">3. If Je&s;us taught and practi&s;ed the be&s;t morality, and if he accounts given of his life and character, by his biogra|phers, be true, then it mu&s;t be allowed, that he was a per&s;on of &s;trict integrity, one who &s;poke the truth and had no in|tention

to deceive. Admitting this, let us attend to what is related by them re&s;|pecting his <HI>miracles.</HI> A que&s;tion aro&s;e among the di&s;ciples of John the Bapti&s;t, whether Je&s;us were he that &s;hould come or they &s;hould look for another? With this que&s;tion John &s;ent them to Je&s;us; and at the time of their arrival, Je&s;us was employed in healing the &s;ick, giv|ing &s;ight to the blind, and performing other miraculous and benevolent works. In&s;tead of giving any direct an&s;wer to their inquiry, he &s;aid. "Go and &s;hew John the things which you hear and &s;ee: The blind receive their &s;ight, the lame walk, the lepers are clean&s;ed, the deaf hear, the dead are rai&s;ed and the poor have the go&s;pel preached to them."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matthew xi. Luke vii.</NOTE> Was not this an appeal to the miracles which he wrought? Did he not re&s;t the proof of his divine mi&s;&s;ion on that evi|dence? And wherein con&s;i&s;ted the force of the evidence? It had been foretold by the ancient prophets, that this &s;hould be one of the characters of the Me&s;&s;iah;<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">I&s;aia. XXXV, LXI.</NOTE>
<PB N="56" REF="028256_0054_0FD8484300DA4300">
John was acquainted with the&s;e prophe|cies; the an&s;wer therefore was perti|nent and the argument conclu&s;ive. And would a per&s;on of a truly virtuous character have u&s;ed an unfair argument on &s;o &s;olemn an occa&s;ion?</P>
<P N="4">4. In the &s;ame manner did he appeal to his <HI>re&s;urrection,</HI> as a proof of his di|vine mi&s;&s;ion. When the Jews a&s;ked him, "what &s;ign &s;howe&s;t thou to us, &s;eeing thou do&s;t the&s;e things?" He an|&s;wered, "de&s;troy this temple, (meaning his body,) and in three days I will rai&s;e it up."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John ii.19</NOTE> If at fir&s;t they did not under|&s;tand the figure contained in this an&s;wer, yet they did afterward; for at his buri|al, they told Pilate, "Sir, we remem|ber that this deceiver &s;aid while he was yet alive, after three days I will ri&s;e again."<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mat xxvii, 63.</NOTE> The re&s;urrection of Je&s;us was an event which he foreknew, which he foretold, to which he appealed, and to which his apo&s;tles appealed as a deci|&s;ive proof of his divine character and mi&s;&s;ion. If he were a truly virtuous man, he would not have foretold &s;uch event,
<PB N="57" REF="028256_0055_0FD8487AA14F7358">
unle&s;s he had a well grounded faith that it would come to pa&s;s; and if his di&s;|ciples learned their morality of him, they would not have related &s;uch an event, unle&s;s they had known it to be true. To pretend that the &s;tory of his re&s;urrection was fabricated by his di&s;ci|ples as a counterpart to the &s;tory of his miraculous conception is a reproach as weak and malicious as the old calumny of the Jews, "that his di&s;ciples came by night and &s;tole him away;" to pretend, at the &s;ame time, a re&s;pect to the charac|ter of Je&s;us as virtuous and amiable, is a palpable incon&s;i&s;tency; and, to in&s;inu|ate that the authors of the &s;tory are un|known, and that the time when it was invented, is unknown; is nothing more than "a wretched contrivance," to pal|liate a fal&s;e and groundle&s;s pretence.</P>
<P>It is in vain to attempt to &s;eperate things which are &s;o intimately connect|ed as the virtuous character of Je&s;us, and the truth of his miracles and re&s;ur|rection. They re&s;t on the &s;ame evidence and mu&s;t &s;tand or fall together. It is
<PB N="58" REF="028256_0056_0FD84844A5C9ACF0">
impo&s;&s;ible to believe that Je&s;us was vir|tuous and good, and yet that he wrought no miracles and did not ri&s;e from the dead; for a good man would not have ap|pealed to &s;uch facts, and to &s;uch an event, as the proofs of his divine mi&s;&s;ion, un|le&s;s they had been realities.</P>
<P>If therefore we would be con&s;i&s;tent with our&s;elves, and treat tho&s;e ancient and venerable hi&s;torians, who have writ|ten the life of Je&s;us, with the &s;ame can|dor and re&s;pect, as other hi&s;torians of equal antiquity; we mu&s;t not only be|lieve, that &s;uch a per&s;on as Je&s;us Chri&s;t did exi&s;t, and that he bore a virtuous and amiable character; but we mu&s;t be|lieve that he was &s;ent by God, to be the Saviour of the world; that he an&s;wered in all re&s;pects the characters which had been given of the Me&s;&s;iah, in particular, that he went about doing good; and though he was put to death, yet that he ro&s;e from death to immortality. Why &s;hould not the&s;e facts be believed on the &s;ame te&s;timony with that which &s;upports the virtue and goodne&s;s of his character?
<PB N="59" REF="028256_0057_0FD8487C02DE7B58">
Were not his miracles one part of the proof of his benevolence? And did they not gain him the love as well the vene|ration of the people? Tho&s;e works were, to the people who &s;aw and receiv|ed benefit by them, the mo&s;t demon&s;tra|tive proofs of the goodne&s;s and power of the per&s;on who wrought them; they proved that he was a prophet &s;ent from God. To us, the&s;e miracles have <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> that &s;ame direct and intuitive evidence; but &s;till they are of u&s;e. The relation of them is credible; the nature of them was beneficial; they were a fulfilment of ancient prophecy; and, they &s;erve to confirm our faith in the virtuous and amiable character of the per&s;on who wrought them. If we believe that he was virtuous, certainly he was not the le&s;s virtuous for doing &s;o much good, as the evangeli&s;ts have reported of him.</P>
<P>His re&s;urrection may be con&s;idered in one view, as the reward of his virtuous and amiable conduct, and of the patience with which he endured his la&s;t &s;uffer|ings. Is it not credible, that virtue
<PB N="60" REF="028256_0058_0FD84845FB716840">
&s;hould be rewarded with immortal life and happine&s;s? Why &s;hould it be thought incredible, that God &s;hould rai&s;e the dead? But there is a farther u&s;e to be made of this great event. For as Je|&s;us hath &s;et us an example of virtue, which we are bound to imitate; &s;o God hath, by the re&s;urrection of his Son, given us an a&s;&s;urance, that our virtue &s;hall be rewarded, in the &s;ame manner. And what is the de&s;ign of this, but to encourage us to per&s;evere in a clo&s;e imi|tation of the character of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, tru&s;ting in his promi&s;e, "becau&s;e I live, ye &s;hall live al&s;o?"</P>
<P>Upon the whole, let every one who is acquainted with hi&s;tory and chronolo|gy, or who may be ea&s;ily informed, if he thinks it worthy his inquiry, be a&s;k|ed the&s;e que&s;tions. Do you believe that there was &s;uch a per&s;on as Je&s;us Chri&s;t? That he was born and lived in Judea, in the latter part of the fifth century, after the return of the Jews from the Babylon|i&s;h captivity? In the reigns of Augu&s;|tus and Tiberius, Emperors of Rome?
<PB N="61" REF="028256_0059_0FD8487D97683000">
that he was a per&s;on of a virtuous cha|racter, that he practi&s;ed what he taught, and that the writers of his life learned their morality of him? If he an&s;wers the&s;e que&s;tions in the affirmative, he mu&s;t, to be con&s;i&s;tent with him&s;elf, be a chri&s;tian: He cannot rea&s;onably doubt the truth of the miracles, nor the re&s;ur|rection of Je&s;us Chri&s;t; he cannot rea|&s;onably doubt of the doctrines, the duties nor the tendency of the whole go&s;pel &s;y&s;tem through time and eternity.</P>

<HEAD>ON THE TESTIMONY OF THE ROMAN CEN|TURION TO THE CHARACTER OF JESUS CHRIST.</HEAD>
<P>IN any matter of con&s;equence, which engages our attention, it is very de&s;ireable to have the opinion of &s;en&s;i|ble, ob&s;erving and judicious per&s;ons in our favour. This &s;erves to keep as in

<P>There is no que&s;tion of more impor|tance to us, than whether the Chri&s;tian religion be true or not; and there is no human being who is unconcerned in this que&s;tion. But a per&s;on may be really concerned in a matter on which he is to give an opinion, and yet not know it, at the time. The ca&s;e of David is full to the point. When Na|than delivered the parable of the rich man who had taken away the poor man's lamb, David knew not that he was the per&s;on, but he gave a ju&s;t deci|&s;ion, on the merits of the cau&s;e. The Centurion who attended the crucifixion of Je&s;us, did not know that he had any other concern in the tran&s;actions of the day, than that he was to do his duty as the officer of the guard. He was not a

Jew; and therefore had no tincture of the prejudice which the Jewi&s;h nation had again&s;t Je&s;us. Nor was he one of his di&s;ciples and therefore had no expec|tation of honour and preferment in his kingdom, as the be&s;t of them, at that time had. He was to all intents an im|partial, unprejudiced per&s;on. Yet, from the ob&s;ervations, which he had opportu|nity of making on that &s;ingular event, the death of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and its atten|dant circum&s;tances, he deliberately and voluntarily pronounced him to be the SON of GOD; and the &s;oldiers of the guard joined with him in the &s;ame te&s;|timony.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matthew xx<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">ii.54.</NOTE></P>

<P N="1">1. The cruel hatred and enmity of the Jews to Je&s;us. It is not u&s;ual among any people, who make pretences to civil|ization, to treat a per&s;on with in&s;ult, when he is going to &s;uffer death by a judicial &s;entence; be his crimes ever &s;o odious and dete&s;table and his &s;entence ever &s;o ju&s;t.

But here, the
<PB N="65" REF="028256_0063_0FD8488398626E80">
ca&s;e was far otherwi&s;e. Je&s;us was ac|cu&s;ed of no crime, which the Centurion could judge de&s;erved death. Nor, did any thing appear in his character or con|duct which merited outrage and vio|lence. But the Jews had wrought them|&s;elves up to a furious pa&s;&s;ion, and vented them&s;elves in the mo&s;t bitter, &s;cornful, reproaching and in&s;ulting language. This was not done by the common peo|ple only, from whom no better treat|ment could be expected; but by the prie&s;ts, the elders and the &s;cribes; the eccle&s;ia&s;tical rulers, the mo&s;t &s;acred and dignified characters.</P>
<P N="2">2. He mu&s;t al&s;o have ob&s;erved, the mild, meek and patient behaviour of Je&s;us; "who when he was reviled, re|viled not again;" and, in&s;tead of &s;how|ing any di&s;plea&s;ure again&s;t them for their cruel and abu&s;ive treatment, pitied his per&s;ecutors, and in his la&s;t agonies prayed for them, "Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do."</P>
<P>There was a mo&s;t &s;urprizing contra&s;t between the temper of the per&s;ecutors

There was nothing in him which appeared to de|&s;erve it; and if there had been, &s;till it would have been ba&s;e and ungenerous to in&s;ult a per&s;on when he was in their power, and they were inflicting on him the extreme puni&s;hment of the law: No brave, candid mind could approve &s;uch conduct. On the contrary, the temper of Je&s;us was all meekne&s;s, patience and benevolence; not an angry re&s;entful word or look proceeded from him; but he manife&s;ted a calm, com|po&s;ed, re&s;igned, dignified deportment, and a tender concern for his enemies when they were loading him with re|proaches. This contra&s;t could not but have been ob&s;erved by the Centurion and his company.</P>
<P N="3">3. Another circum&s;tance was the uncommon darkne&s;s, which over|&s;pread the land, at the time of the cru|cifixion. The account of this dark|ne&s;s, given by the evangelical hi&s;torians,
<PB N="67" REF="028256_0065_0FD848839C140CA0">
like all their accounts of extraordinary facts, is very &s;hort and &s;imple. "From the &s;ixth hour, there was darkne&s;s over all the land, till the ninth hour." They relate the event, but not the &s;econdary cau&s;es, which produced it; for their writings were de&s;igned, not to &s;olve phenomena in the natural world, nor to teach us philo&s;ophy; but to give us a true account of the chri&s;tian religion and the means by which it was introduced into the world.</P>
<P N="4">4. The darkne&s;s, having continued three hours, was &s;ucceeded by an earth|quake. "The earth did quake, and the rocks rent," i. e. the rocks of mount Calvary, where the Centurion and his company were performing their duty. An earthquake naturally excites terror; and this event mu&s;t have given an addi|tional &s;olemnity to the &s;cene, and made a deep impre&s;&s;ion on the minds of the Centurion and his company. Accord|ingly it is remarked by the hi&s;torian, that when they "&s;aw the earthquake" and its effects, "they feared greatly."</P>
<P N="5"><PB N="68" REF="028256_0066_0FD84850264CCB58">5. Another circum&s;tance as remark|able as any, was the conver&s;ation which Je&s;us had with the penitent thief, and which pa&s;&s;ed within the hearing of the Centurion. Je&s;us was crucified between two thieves, one of whom joined with the Jewi&s;h prie&s;ts, in reviling him, and was reproved for it by the other, who &s;aid; "Do&s;t thou not fear God, &s;eeing thou art in the &s;ame condemnation? And we indeed ju&s;tly, but this man hath done nothing ami&s;s." Having thus borne his te&s;timony to the innocency of Je&s;us, he turned him&s;elf to him and &s;aid, "Lord remember me when thou come&s;t into thy kingdom." To which Je&s;us an&s;wered, "<HI>Amen,</HI> I &s;ay to thee, this day &s;halt thou be with me in Para|di&s;e."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Luke xxiii.43. (Greek)</NOTE> Both the&s;e per&s;ons were then apparently going out of this world, in|to the invi&s;ible &s;tate, yet the thief had an idea, that Je&s;us was a King, and was going to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his kingdom; and though dying, he prayed that Je&s;us would remember him, when he &s;hould
<PB N="69" REF="028256_0067_0FD84885CCB791C8">
come into his kingdom. What kind of a kingdom mu&s;t this have been? Not a kingdom of this world, but a &s;piritual and a heavenly kingdom. The thief therefore, might be &s;uppo&s;ed to pray to Je&s;us for an admi&s;&s;ion into a &s;tate of happine&s;s after death. This prayer was immediately an&s;wered by Je&s;us, with a voice full of maje&s;ty and dignity, promi&s;ing him admi&s;&s;ion into Paradi&s;e. What mu&s;t an impartial &s;pectator think of &s;uch a conver&s;ation? Mu&s;t he not conclude that Je&s;us really had a power over departed &s;pirits, to appoint them to a &s;tate of happine&s;s, and that the thief had a full per&s;ua&s;ion of this truth, and ventured his &s;alvation upon it?</P>
<P N="6">6. Another circum&s;tance was the cry which Je&s;us uttered as he was ex|piring. "Father, into thy hands, I commend my &s;pirit."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Luke xxiii.46.</NOTE> The&s;e words it is &s;aid, he cried with a loud voice; which was an evidence of the inward &s;trength and vigour, both of his body and mind, notwith&s;tanding his pain and
<PB N="70" REF="028256_0068_0FD848514104A690">
and the lo&s;s of blood from his wounds. It was al&s;o an indication, that he died at his own time, that no man took his life from him, but that he laid it down of him&s;elf, and re&s;igned his &s;pirit into the hands of his father. It is ob&s;erved, by one of the hi&s;torians, that when Jo&s;eph of Arimathea, begged of Pilate, the bo|dy of Je&s;us, "Pilate marvelled if he were already dead," and would not be|lieve it, till he had called the Centurion, and was a&s;&s;ured of it by him;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mark 2<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">, 44.</NOTE> whence it appears that Je&s;us died much &s;ooner than it was u&s;ual for per&s;ons in tho&s;e circum&s;tances to die; and indeed &s;oon|er than the companions of his &s;uffer|ings.</P>
<P>This loud expiring cry, joined with the other circum&s;tances abovementioned, drew from the Centurion and his compa|ny that hone&s;t confe&s;&s;ion.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ver. 38.</NOTE> "Truly this man was the Son of God." The penetration and &s;en&s;ibility which were di&s;covered by the&s;e military characters,
<PB N="71" REF="028256_0069_0FD84886814702D8">
did them much honour. They were greatly affected with the &s;ingularity and &s;olemnity of the &s;cene; their confe&s;&s;ion was the re&s;ult of conviction; it was vo|luntary and &s;incere, and they could have no inducement to make it, but the force of truth.</P>
<P>The Centurion's expre&s;&s;ion as given by Luke is, "certainly this was a righteous man;" <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Luke xxiii.47.</NOTE> which amounts to what the penitent thief had &s;aid, "This man hath done nothing ami&s;s," or to what Pilate had &s;aid before, "I find no fault in this man." The&s;e are full and &s;ufficient proofs of the <HI>innocency</HI> of the character of Je&s;us; but the te&s;timony, "that he was the SON of GOD," ri&s;es &s;till higher and proves that the Centu|rian did believe him to have been a per|&s;on of extraordinary dignity, honoured with a &s;pecial commi&s;&s;ion from God. He had doubtle&s;s learned this phra&s;e from his acquaintance with the Jews, it being one of the names, by which they were u&s;ed to call the Me&s;&s;iah, whom
<PB N="72" REF="028256_0070_0FD84852DBA210F0">
they expected.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P&s;alm ii.7.</NOTE> He probably knew that Je&s;us was put to death, for a&s;&s;uming this character; he had heard him re|peatedly pray to God, on the cro&s;s, call|ing him <HI>Father</HI>; "Father, forgive them." "Father, into thy hands I commend my &s;pirit;" and he had rea|&s;on to believe from the extraordinary behaviour of the &s;ufferer, and the &s;o|lemn appearance of the face of nature, on that memorable day, that Je&s;us was &s;incere in the&s;e addre&s;&s;es, and that God had heard him; whence it was natural for him to conclude, that there was &s;ome &s;pecial union and relation between God and him, as between a father and a &s;on; that he was inve&s;ted by the father, with a power over death and the future &s;tate; that he had a kingdom beyond the grave, in the un&s;een world, and could di&s;po&s;e of departed &s;ouls at his plea&s;ure. Such a te&s;timony, coming from &s;uch a per&s;on, at &s;uch a time, reflects the high|e&s;t honour on the character of Je&s;us, and is a &s;triking evidence in favour of
<PB N="73" REF="028256_0071_0FD8488805BD44D0">
the chri&s;tian revelation. Could any per&s;on more de&s;ervedly receive &s;uch un|&s;ought, unbia&s;&s;ed te&s;timonies?

<HEAD>ON THE CIRCUMSTANCES ATTENDING THE RESURRECTION OF JESUS CHRIST.</HEAD>
<P>THE dignity and &s;olemnity of this grand event, and the infinitely mo|mentous con&s;equences of it to us and to all mankind, may ju&s;tly &s;trike our minds with awe and reverence; yet if we would entertain a ju&s;t idea of it, we mu&s;t enter familiarly into all its circum|&s;tances;

and even into the affections, the weakne&s;&s;es and the prejudices of tho&s;e who were fir&s;t acquainted with it; for they were human beings like our|&s;elves, having rea&s;on and pa&s;&s;ion in exer|ci&s;e at once; and the tumult of both produced tho&s;e effects; which we are now to contemplate.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible to read the hi&s;tory of the life and death of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, with|out ob&s;erving the con&s;tant, zealous and re&s;pectful attention of his female friends. We find among them &s;ingular in&s;tances of attachment to a worthy and amiable character in the mo&s;t di&s;tre&s;&s;ing &s;cenes. They gave the &s;tronge&s;t proofs of their love to him, even when mo&s;t of his cho&s;en di&s;ciples for&s;ook him; they kept as near to him as the circum&s;tances he was in would allow; and, they would gladly have mini&s;tered to him and com|forted him in his la&s;t moments, had they been permitted.</P>
<P>Among the friends of Je&s;us were two per&s;ons who had hitherto kept them|&s;elves concealed; but an occa&s;ion of his
<PB N="77" REF="028256_0075_0FD84891D04BB120">
death appeared openly and boldly in the character of di&s;ciples. The&s;e were Jo&s;eph of Arimathea and Nicodemus both members of the Jewi&s;h council, but who had not been concerned in the proceedings again&s;t him. The provi|dence of God &s;o directed the manner of their expre&s;&s;ing their regard to Je&s;us, as to make them in&s;trumental of fulfilling two remarkable prophecies re&s;pecting the Me&s;&s;iah. One was that he &s;hould not "&s;ee corruption;"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P&s;alm xvi.10.</NOTE> the other was that he &s;hould "make his grave with the wicked and with the rich".<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">I&s;aiah liii.9.</NOTE> The two thieves were doubtle&s;s buried in Golgotha, the common burying ground, in or near the place of crucifixion; but the body of Je&s;us, after Jo&s;eph had ob|tained leave of Pilate, was conveyed in|to his own garden, nigh at hand, in which was a new &s;epulchre hewn out of a rock; and becau&s;e it was the day of preparation before the Sabbath, and it was near night, he thought it be&s;t to depo&s;it the body in that new &s;epulchre.
<PB N="78" REF="028256_0076_0FD8485A41229E70">
To pre&s;erve it in the mo&s;t decent man|ner which circum&s;tances would then ad|mit, Jo&s;eph and Nicodemus who were both men of wealth, brought fine linen with a large quantity of myrrh and aloes. "Then took they the body of Je&s;us, and wound it in the linen cloth, with the &s;pices, as the manner of the Jews was to bury." Thus by means of the rich drugs applied to the wounded body, and the linen wrapped around it, togeth|er with the coolne&s;s of the rock in which the &s;epulchre was hewn, the body of Je&s;us was effectually pre&s;erved from corruption, during the time appointed for its continuance in the grave. The entrance of the &s;epulchre was clo&s;ed with a great &s;tone; and the body being thus &s;ecured by his friends, they retired and "re&s;ted the &s;eventh day according to the commandment."</P>
<P>But his enemies could not re&s;t. They remembered what his di&s;ciples had for|gotten, that he had foretold his own re|&s;urrection on the third day; and they were afraid that &s;omething might take
<PB N="79" REF="028256_0077_0FD8489335201900">
place which &s;hould give countenance to &s;uch a report. They feared that tho&s;e of his di&s;ciples who had buried him, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of others, would come by night and take away his body and would &s;o effectually conceal it, that there would be &s;ufficient ground to &s;ay that he was ri&s;en from the dead; and thus "the la&s;t error would be wor&s;e than the fir&s;t." i. e. the people would be more ready to profe&s;s their regard to him af|ter the report of his re&s;urrection than they were during his life. Filled with this idea, they a&s;&s;embled on the Sabbath and went in a body to Pilate, de&s;iring that the &s;epulchre might be &s;ecured till the third day. He granted them a guard which they placed in Jo&s;eph's garden, to watch the &s;epulchre. Having as may well be &s;uppo&s;ed, fir&s;t looked into it to &s;ee that the body was there, they clo&s;ed the entrance and &s;ealed the &s;tone; and it is probable that their de&s;ign was to keep the body till after the third day, and then publicly expo&s;e it to view; that they might at once ruin the credit
<PB N="80" REF="028256_0078_0FD8485DAC4EAAA8">
of the prediction and the character of Je&s;us.</P>
<P>Thus it appears that divine provi|dence overruled the de&s;igns of his ene|mies, as well as the endeavours of his friends, to give the utmo&s;t &s;trength to the proof of his re&s;urrection. All po&s;|&s;ible care was taken to pre&s;erve and &s;e|cure his body; by his friends, to pre|&s;erve it from corruption&punc; and by his ene|mies, to &s;ecure it from removal. It be|came nece&s;&s;ary then for a &s;pecial divine agency to be manife&s;ted, in accompli&s;h|ing that glorious event; on which the truth of the go&s;pel and our hope of &s;al|vation e&s;&s;entially depend.</P>
<P>The &s;pace of time in which Je&s;us had foretold that he &s;hould lie in the grave, is in one place, &s;aid to be "three days and and three nights;"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matt. xii.40.</NOTE> in other places, the prediction is that he &s;hould ri&s;e "on the third day."<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ch. xvi.21. and xx.19.</NOTE> According to the Jewi&s;h mode of reckoning the, evening belonged to the day which followed it, and not to the day which preceeded it.
<PB N="81" REF="028256_0079_0FD8489428CFE810">
The day ended at the &s;etting of the &s;un; and then the next day began. The day on which Je&s;us died, according to our mode of reckoning, was Friday at three of the clock in the afternoon. The re|maining part of that day, viz. from that hour to the &s;etting of the &s;un, the Jews would call the fir&s;t day of his death. Then the next twenty four hours, which ended at &s;un&s;et on the Jewi&s;h Sabbath, was the &s;econd day; and the following night and day, belonged to the third day. The &s;everal phra&s;es "three days and nights," or "after three days," or "in three days," &s;igni|fy the &s;ame as, "on the third day;" and thus the Jews under&s;tood it.

<P>The friends of Je&s;us were &s;o far from intending &s;uch a thing as the removal of his body, to favour the &s;uppo&s;ition of a re&s;urrection, that they neither under|&s;tood nor believed what he had &s;everal times told them of his ri&s;ing from the dead. They had &s;o deeply imbibed the Jewi&s;h idea of a Me&s;&s;iah, who &s;hould "abide forever," that when Je&s;us was dead, all their hopes were dead al&s;o. They had &s;een that he did not deliver him&s;elf from the power of his enemies; but was fallen a &s;acrifice to their malice; and with the ideas of temporal domin|ion which they entertained, what could they think of his being the king of I&s;rael? As they knew his pious, hum|ble and benevolent character, it mu&s;t
<PB N="83" REF="028256_0081_0FD84895A90BCC18">
have filled them with perplexity to ac|count for his being put to death as a criminal. As the Jews had gratified their malice again&s;t him, it was natural to expect that the &s;ame vengeance would be executed on his followers. The terror of this, made them at fir&s;t de&s;ert him; it cau&s;ed Peter to deny him; and it operated &s;o &s;trongly on all, that when they came together, to confer on the &s;trange things which had happened, they &s;hut them&s;elves up for fear of the Jews. Such was the &s;tate of their minds; and hence it is ea&s;y to conclude that the apprehen&s;ion of the Jews, le&s;t the&s;e men &s;hould &s;teal the body of Je&s;us, and then rai&s;e a report of his re&s;urrec|tion, was entirely groundle&s;s. All which the mo&s;t zealous and forward of them intended, was to embalm it, in the mo&s;t re&s;pectful and honourable manner, on the day following the Sabbath. For this, they had begun their preparations in the evening, and with an attempt to put this de&s;ign in execution, the morn|ing of the third day was opened. But
<PB N="84" REF="028256_0082_0FD84864EE138458">
the providence of God di&s;appointed that de&s;ign and introduced a new, &s;urpri&s;ing and magnificent &s;cene, of which they had not any idea or expectation. The particular circum&s;tances of it, I &s;hall now recite, in the order, in which, from a compari&s;on of the four Evangeli&s;ts, I conceive them to have happened.</P>
<P>When the Sabbath was pa&s;t, i. e. in the evening following the Sabbath, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the moth|er of James, with Salome and Joanna and other women, bought &s;weet &s;pices that they might anoint the body of Je|&s;us, in the preparation of which they employed them&s;elves during a part or perhaps the whole of the night. Very early in the morning, ju&s;t as the dawn began to appear, Mary Magdalene went from home, with the other Mary and Salome, to &s;ee the &s;epulchre, leaving Joanna and the other women to bring the &s;pices. As they were pro|ceeding toward Jo&s;eph's garden, near Mount Calvary, they &s;aid among them|&s;elves, "who &s;hall roll away the &s;tone
<PB N="85" REF="028256_0083_0FD8489A771DC978">
from the door of the &s;epulchre? For it was very great." It is evident from this conver&s;ation, that &s;ome of them had &s;een the &s;tone placed there by Jo|&s;eph and Nicodemus, two evenings be|fore; and the removal of this &s;tone, was the only difficulty, of which they had any apprehen&s;ion; the guard hav|ing been placed there in the evening preceeding, without their knowledge. But, when they approached the &s;epul|chre, they &s;aw the &s;tone removed; and it had been removed in a manner of which they had not the lea&s;t expecta|tion. For, about the time of their &s;et|ting out from home, there was an earth|quake; the noi&s;e of which would pro|bably have awakened the guard, if they had been a&s;leep; and an angel of the Lord had de&s;cended from heaven, and came into the garden, and removed the &s;tone from the door of the &s;epulchre, and &s;at upon it. "His countenance was like lightning," fla&s;hing around him; "and his raiment white as &s;now; and for fear of him" the guards trem|bled
<PB N="86" REF="028256_0084_0FD8486653112E08">
and became as dead. At the in|&s;tant of this maje&s;tic appearance of the angel, and the terror of the guards; Je|&s;us, being awakened from the &s;leep of death, probably by another angel, aro&s;e and came out of the &s;epulchre; his bo|dy being transformed in &s;uch a peculiar manner, as to be vi&s;ible or invi&s;ible at his plea&s;ure; and, the &s;ame peculiarity at|tended the angels al&s;o. It is probable that the guards, as &s;oon as they had re|covered from their &s;urprize, and &s;een the &s;epulchre open, fled from the garden; for there is no account, that any of them were &s;een by the friends of Je&s;us, at their approach.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as Mary Magdalene, who was the foremo&s;t of the company, per|ceived that the &s;tone was taken away, and the &s;epulchre open, &s;he left her companions, and ran to inform Peter and John, of what &s;he had di&s;covered; and &s;aid to them, "they have taken away the Lord, out of the &s;epulchre, and we know not where they have laid him."</P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="028256_0085_0FD81B59D91CECB0">Whil&s;t &s;he was gone on this errand, the other women advanced to the &s;epul|chre, and went in; where they &s;aw an angel in the likene&s;s of a young man, &s;itting on the right &s;ide, clothed in a long white garment, and they were af|frighted. But he &s;aid to them, "be not affrighted, ye &s;eek Je&s;us of Naza|reth, who was crucified; he is ri&s;en, he is not here; behold the place where they laid him. But go your way, tell his di&s;ciples, and Peter, that he goeth before you into Galilee; there &s;hall ye &s;ee him, as he &s;aid to you." Having di&s;tinctly heard the&s;e words, they went out and fled; and it is remarked, that they &s;aid nothing to any per&s;on whom they met by the way; though probably they met &s;ome of their own friends.</P>
<P>After they were gone, Peter and John, who had heard the report of Mary Mag|dalene, came running to the &s;epulchre. John out ran Peter and came fir&s;t; and &s;tooping down, he looked in and &s;aw the linen cloths, in which the body of Je&s;us had been enclo&s;ed, but he went
<PB N="88" REF="028256_0086_0FD84867D0AE8200">
not in. When Peter came, he went in and made a further di&s;covery; that the napkin which was about his head did not lie with the other linen, but was wrapped together in a place by it&s;elf. Then John went in and &s;aw the &s;ame, and <HI>he believed,</HI> i. e. he was the fir&s;t of the di&s;ciples who believed the re&s;urrec|tion of his Lord. For as yet, the others knew not the meaning of the &s;cripture, and of his own prediction&punc; that he &s;hould ri&s;e from the dead. The&s;e two di&s;ciples having examined all the objects pre&s;ented to their view, went away and probably called together the re&s;t of the eleven, to tell them what they had &s;een.</P>
<P>But Mary Magdalene, who had come back to the &s;epulchre, with, or &s;oon af|ter Peter and John, &s;tayed without, at the door, weeping; and as &s;he wept, &s;he &s;tooped down, and &s;aw two angels, who had been invi&s;ible, whil&s;t Peter and John were there. They were cloth|ed in white, and were &s;itting one at the head, the other at the feet of the place

were the body of Je&s;us had lain. They &s;aid to her, "Woman, why weepe&s;t thou?" She an&s;wered, "Becau&s;e they have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid him." When &s;he had &s;aid this, &s;he turned her&s;elf back and &s;aw Je&s;us, but knew not that it was he. Je&s;us &s;aid to her, "Woman, why weepe&s;t thou? whom &s;eeke&s;t thou?" She &s;uppo&s;ing him to be the Gardener, &s;aid, "Sir, if thou ha&s;t borne him hence tell me where thou ha&s;t laid him, and I will take him away." Ob&s;erve, &s;he did not name the per&s;on, for whom &s;he was looking, but concluded that the keeper of the garden mu&s;t know whom &s;he meant. Je&s;us then a&s;&s;uming his u&s;ual familiar voice, called her "Mary!" In|&s;tantly, &s;he knew the joyful &s;ound, and flew to embrace him, crying "Rabboni! or my Ma&s;ter." But Je&s;us &s;aid "Touch me not, for I am not yet a&s;cended to my Father." The meaning was, do not now &s;pend time in embracing me, I &s;hall not yet leave the world, and go to my father; you will have opportunity to

&s;ee me again; "but go to my brethren and &s;ay to them, I a&s;cend to my father and your father, to my God and your God." This was the fir&s;t appearance of Je&s;us.</P>
<P>His next appearance was to the other Mary and Salome, and, probably the other women, Joanna and her company who were bringing the &s;pices and had turned back al&s;o. For as the women were going to deliver to the di&s;ciples the me&s;&s;age which the angels had given them: Je&s;us met them, &s;aying "All hail!" And they, came and held him by the feet, and wor&s;hipped him. Then &s;aid Je&s;us to them, "Be not afraid, go tell my brethren, that they go before me into Galilee and there &s;hall they &s;ee me."</P>
<P>Should any difficulty ari&s;e from the account given by Luke of the women's vi&s;it to the &s;epulchre; where he &s;peaks of two men in &s;hining garments who gave them a me&s;&s;age to the di&s;ciples of the &s;ame import, though not preci&s;ely in the &s;ame words, as that which Matthew and Mark have recorded; candour will
<PB N="91" REF="028256_0089_0FD848A4299631C8">
oblige us to &s;olve it, by &s;uppo&s;ing, either that &s;ome of them &s;aw but one, and others both the angels; who might make them&s;elves vi&s;ible at one time and not at another, to one per&s;on and not to another or el&s;e, that different women came in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the &s;epulchre and that the angels, repeated the me&s;&s;age to them.</P>
<P>When the&s;e women came into the city, they went to the eleven, who had met together. To them they reported what they had &s;een and heard; but their words &s;eemed as idle tales and they be|lieved them not. This ob&s;ervation mu&s;t be applied only to the major part of the eleven; for John had been to the &s;epul|chre, and had ob&s;erved &s;o much, as in|duced him to believe the re&s;urrection of Je&s;us; and Peter was wondering in his heart at the things which had happened. On this report of the women, who &s;aid that they had &s;een a vi&s;ion of angels, Luke &s;ays that "Peter aro&s;e and ran to the &s;epulchre." This is &s;uppo&s;ed to have been a &s;econd vi&s;it, which he
<PB N="92" REF="028256_0090_0FD8486BCFDB1500">
made; but, at this &s;econd vi&s;it, <HI>he</HI> &s;aw no angels; he only looked in, and &s;aw the linen cloths lying as they were be|fore. Either with Peter or &s;oon after, &s;ome others of the eleven went thither and found the &s;epulchre in the &s;ame &s;ituation; but they &s;aw not the angels, nor their ri&s;en Lord.</P>
<P>About this time, Cleopas and ano|ther of the di&s;ciples departed from the city to go to Emmaus; in which jour|ney they had an interview with Je&s;us, which completely &s;atisfied them that he was ri&s;en from the dead. The de&s;ign of this appearance of Je&s;us was to im|pre&s;s on the minds of the&s;e two di&s;ci|ples, an argument for the truth of his being the Me&s;&s;iah which had not been con&s;idered by any of them as it ought to have been, I mean the argument from prophecy. That they might under|&s;tand this argument properly and exer|ci&s;e their rea&s;on in judging of it, he did not di&s;cover him&s;elf at once; but di&s;|gui&s;ed him&s;elf in the habit of a traveller and entered into familiar conver&s;ation
<PB N="93" REF="028256_0091_0FD848A4329B0848">
with them, on the &s;ubject. Having thus in a rational way prepared their minds for the belief of his re&s;urrection, of which they had heard &s;ome report; but were in doubt and &s;adne&s;s on ac|count of it, her pre&s;ented him&s;elf before them as their ri&s;en Lord, and gave them &s;en&s;ible evidence of the truth of what the women had reported.</P>
<P>On their return to the city, they found that the evidence of this great event had gained ground during their ab&s;ence, by an appearance of the Lord to Simon, the particulars of which are not record|ed; but neither the report of this ap|pearance nor of his being &s;een of them at Emmaus was &s;atisfactory to the eleven, until Je&s;us him&s;elf came into the mid&s;t of them, and did eat and drink before them; and made them handle him and judge on the mo&s;t &s;en&s;i|ble and demon&s;trative proof, that, the &s;ame body which had been crucified, dead and buried was alive again. The &s;ame kind of demon&s;tration was given to Thomas at their next meeting, and
<PB N="94" REF="028256_0092_0FD8486D028F26C0">
thus the whole number were fully &s;atis|fied by the mo&s;t infallible evidence.</P>
<P>It is now proper to turn our attention to the enemies of Je&s;us, and &s;ee what effect this extraordinary event had on them. It is &s;aid by Matthew, that "<HI>&s;ome</HI> of the watch came into the city, and told the chief prie&s;ts all things that were done," as far as they were acquainted with them. The&s;e &s;oldiers doubtle&s;s told the truth, and probably <HI>others</HI> of them might tell the &s;ame truth to other people. Such an event was an occa&s;i|on of &s;urpri&s;e and concern to the Jewi&s;h prie&s;ts, who&s;e intere&s;t it was to ruin the credit of the miracle. When they had a&s;&s;embled and con&s;ulted among them|&s;elves, they found no other means in their power to do this, but to bribe the &s;oldiers with a large &s;um of money, to tell this lie, "that the di&s;ciples of Je&s;us had come by night and &s;tolen him away, whil&s;t they &s;lept," and when the &s;oldiers objected, that they &s;hould be puni&s;hed for breach of duty, they gave them this a&s;&s;urance, "if it come to the Governor's
<PB N="95" REF="028256_0093_0FD848A630012B58">
ears, we will per&s;uade him, and &s;ecure you." This argument prevailed; they took the money, and did as they were commanded. This report became cur|rent among the Jews, and continued &s;o till the time when the go&s;pel of Mat|thew was written, in which their arti|fice was detected, and expo&s;ed.</P>
<P>Such were the circum&s;tances attend|ing the re&s;urrection of Je&s;us Chri&s;t; and from the whole, we may fairly de|duce this ob&s;ervation; that if there had been &s;uch a pre-concerted plan among the di&s;ciples, as the Jews pretended, we &s;hould have found them watching for the event, and &s;eizing the fir&s;t report as incontrovertible evidence. But in fact, it was a matter of prophecy, which none of them under&s;tood or expected. The news was received by them with &s;urpri&s;e; and it was a long time before they could overcome their prejudices. Their incredulity in &s;uch a ca&s;e, is the &s;tronge&s;t evidence, that there was no fraud, no de&s;ign, no artifice. Nothing but the mo&s;t demon&s;trative proof could
<PB N="96" REF="028256_0094_0FD8487160C58E90">
convince them; and when this was of|fered, they finally yielded them&s;elves to its force, and believed, that they had &s;een not a &s;pectre as at fir&s;t they imagin|ed; but the real ri&s;en body of their be|loved ma&s;ter.</P>

<HEAD>ON THE QUESTION, WHY THE EVIDENCE OF THE RESURRECTION OF JESUS CHRIST RESTS ENTIRELY ON THE TESTIMONY OF HIS OWN DISCIPLES.</HEAD>
<P>AMONG the objections which the wi&s;dom of this world hath made to the &s;y&s;tem of chri&s;tianity, it hath been alledged that the re&s;urrection of Je&s;us Chri&s;t was witne&s;&s;ed by none but his own di&s;ciples; and the credibility of the fact hath been &s;uppo&s;ed to be greatly injured by this circum&s;tance. It is &s;aid, that "the re&s;urrection, &s;uppo&s;ing it to have taken place, admitted of public and ocular de|mon&s;tration,
<PB N="97" REF="028256_0095_0FD848A8EDE74438">
to all Jeru&s;alem at lea&s;t. A thing which every body is required to believe, requires that the proof of it &s;hould be equal to all, and univer&s;al. In&s;tead of this, a &s;mall number of per&s;ons are in|troduced as proxies for the whole world, to &s;ay that they &s;aw it; and all the re&s;t of the world are called upon to believe it."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Age of Rea&s;on page 14.</NOTE></P>
<P>In an&s;wer to this objection, I will now endeavour to &s;how why this great and capital fact is atte&s;ted in this particular manner; or, why the apo&s;tles and other di&s;ciples of Je&s;us Chri&s;t were the only witne&s;&s;es of his re&s;urrection. To vindi|cate this part of the conduct of divine providence let the following things be con&s;idered.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t.</HI> The Jewi&s;h prie&s;ts and rulers had &s;ufficient evidence of his re&s;urrection without being eye witne&s;&s;es of it. They were per&s;ons endowed with con&s;ummate art and policy: They were fully aware of the con&s;equence of what Je&s;us had fore|told concerning his own re&s;urrection:
<PB N="98" REF="028256_0096_0FD8487242B7D8B8">
They &s;aw that the cau&s;e of chri&s;tianity would be &s;ucce&s;sful if this point were to be believed; and, they took all imagina|ble care to prevent <HI>all</HI> which they expect|ed could or would be done to favour &s;uch a report. They procured a guard and placed it at the &s;epulchre, and &s;ealed the &s;tone, to prevent the di&s;ciples from com|ing by night to &s;teal the body. There was but <HI>one</HI> night in which there could be any apprehen&s;ion of &s;uch an event, and that night con&s;i&s;ted of not more than ten hours, from the clo&s;e of one twilight to the dawn of the next. Now, who can believe that a company of Ro|man &s;oldiers, in &s;uch circum&s;tances, would not do their duty, for one night? Or if they had not done their duty, who can, believe that they would not have been puni&s;hed for their negligence? What the Roman di&s;cipline was in &s;uch ca&s;es we may learn from a &s;imilar circum&s;tance. Peter was impri&s;oned by the command of Herod, and was miraculou&s;ly delivered in the night by the mini&s;try of an angel.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts xii.18, 19.</NOTE>
<PB N="99" REF="028256_0097_0FD848A9BB99A8F0">
"As &s;oon as it was day there was no &s;mall &s;tir among the &s;oldiers, what was become of Peter; and when Herod had &s;ought for him and could not find him, he examined the keepers, and command|ed that they &s;hould be <HI>put to death.</HI>" This was agreeable to the martial law of the Romans; and can any per&s;on be|lieve that the Jewi&s;h prie&s;ts would have behaved, with &s;o much tenderne&s;s and delicacy toward the&s;e &s;oldiers, as not to have complained to the governor and had the martial law executed upon them, if they had been really guilty of &s;leeping on guard? The acknowledged fact is, that the &s;epulchre was opened and the body gone. Had there been really a &s;u&s;picion that it was &s;tolen, they would have argued, that it mu&s;t have been done either by force or by fraud. The guard was &s;et to prevent force, and there would have been re&s;i&s;tance made, the evidence of which would have appeared on trial, in vindication of the &s;oldiers. The &s;eal on the &s;tone was to prevent fraud; which could not have been prac|ti&s;ed
<PB N="100" REF="028256_0098_0FD848F764A37C70">
without connivance; and in this ca&s;e, the broken &s;eal would have been evidence again&s;t them. Sleeping on guard was a breach of tru&s;t, and if urg|ed as an excu&s;e, could not have acquit|ted them. But the truth is, that the &s;oldiers were not brought to a trial, and therefore had no opportunity to ju&s;tify them&s;elves by declaring what they knew to be fact, and the rea&s;on of their not having been brought to trial was that no complaint was made again&s;t them; nor did it con&s;i&s;t with the policy of the Jew|i&s;h rulers to make &s;uch a complaint, be|cau&s;e it would have brought the truth to light and defeated their own de&s;ign.</P>
<P>That &s;uch a report, viz. of the &s;teal|ing the body of Je&s;us by his di&s;ciples was current among the Jews, is allow|ed; it is equally true, that the apo&s;tles knew how it came to be current. Should it be a&s;ked, how could &s;uch an artle&s;s &s;et of men as the apo&s;tles are repre&s;ented to be, have penetrated this &s;ecret? It may be an&s;wered; we are informed by Luke, the writer of the Acts of the a|po&s;tles
<PB N="101" REF="028256_0099_0FD848B30713EB90">
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chap, vi.7.</NOTE> that after &s;ome time "the word of God increa&s;ed and the number of the di&s;ciples was greatly multiplied in Jeru|&s;alem, and a great company of <HI>the prie&s;ts</HI> were obedient to the faith." The&s;e prie&s;ts were probably acquainted with the artifice, the fiction and the bribery which had been practi&s;ed by their brethren; and upon their conver&s;ion would naturally communicate it to the apo&s;tles, of which number Matthew was one, who publi&s;hed it in his go&s;pel. The Jewi&s;h rulers had no means in their power to contradict what was thus pub|li&s;hed. They did not attempt to prove, that the body was &s;tolen; nor to account for its being mi&s;&s;ing; nor to produce it from its concealment, though they had &s;ufficient power to make a &s;earch and &s;uf|ficient inducement to detect the fraud, if any had been really &s;u&s;pected.</P>
<P>The conclu&s;ion then is, that they were con&s;cious to them&s;elves of the truth of the re&s;urrection of Je&s;us. They knew that they had bribed the &s;oldiers
<PB N="102" REF="028256_0100_0FD848B44D080388">
to make a fal&s;e report, and why &s;hould they have done this, if they had not been convinced that Je&s;us was ri&s;en? Let any one who is acquainted with the motives and principles of human actions judge, whether, if the charge of bribery and for|gery thus brought again&s;t the Jews by the chri&s;tians, had been fal&s;e, the Jews would not have taken &s;ome method to vindicate them&s;elves. There was an open controver&s;y between the chri&s;tians and the Jews on that que&s;tion, whether Je&s;us were ri&s;en from the dead. The chri&s;tians boldly and publicly a&s;&s;erted it, and declared them&s;elves witne&s;&s;es of it. And how did the Jews manage their part of the controver&s;y? They contra|dicted and bla&s;phemed: They threatned and per&s;ecuted: They did all which power and malice could do, to hinder the doctrine from being propagated. And what kind of proof is this? It is a &s;pecies of argument which has often been u&s;ed in a bad cau&s;e; but never produced conviction in the mind of any &s;incere inquirer. Since no other argument but
<PB N="103" REF="028256_0101_0FD848B5CD02C7B0">
violence was by them oppo&s;ed to the chri&s;tian doctrine, we may &s;afely con|clude that they had no other to u&s;e; and there is &s;ufficient ground for us to believe that the Jewi&s;h rulers <HI>knew</HI> that Je&s;us was ri&s;en; but endeavoured to conceal the truth and &s;ub&s;titute a fal&s;hood in its place.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly.</HI> It will follow, then, that they were of all men mo&s;t <HI>unworthy</HI> to be indulged with any other evidence or mode of conviction. They had di&s;cov|ered the greate&s;t enmity and malice a|gain&s;t Je&s;us Chri&s;t, his per&s;on, his doc|trine, his miracles and the &s;ucce&s;s of his public mini&s;try: Their prejudice again&s;t him was &s;o &s;trong; that they were di&s;|po&s;ed to re&s;i&s;t the plaine&s;t evidence, which could be offered. To what pur|po&s;e then would have been any other evidence than what they already had? Would it have produced an alteration in their temper or behaviour? What was their conduct toward Lazarus, af|ter Je&s;us had rai&s;ed him from death?" "They gathered a council, and &s;aid,
<PB N="104" REF="028256_0102_0FD848B862127150">
what do we? For this man doth many miracles, if we let him alone, all men will believe on him. And they con&s;ult-that they might put Lazarus to death, becau&s;e that by rea&s;on of him, many of the Jews believed on Je&s;us."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John xi.47, 48, and xii.10.</NOTE> Now would not the &s;ame enmity have operat|ed in the &s;ame way again&s;t Je&s;us him|&s;elf? Would not the &s;ame malice, which put him to death once, have attempted to kill him again? Should it be &s;aid, that Je&s;us might ea&s;ily have e&s;cap|ed out of their hands, as he did &s;everal times, during his life and before his hour was come; &s;uppo&s;e he had, what u&s;e would &s;uch malicious enemies have made of this circum&s;tance? They would have &s;aid, that it was a gho&s;t or &s;pectre, which appeared, and not the real ri&s;en body of Je&s;us: They would have &s;aid that the &s;en&s;es of the people were impo&s;|ed upon by magic; that they were de|luded with a fictitious appearance, and thus they would have evaded the proof of his re&s;urrection. Did they not treat
<PB N="105" REF="028256_0103_0FD848BB34E40DE8">
his miracles in this manner? The&s;e were open and public. The witne&s;&s;es were &s;o many, that the facts could not be denied; but how did the enemies of Je&s;us evade this proof of his divine mi&s;|&s;ion? "He ca&s;teth out devils, by Beel|zebub prince of the devils." If &s;uch was their malicious di&s;po&s;ition, how ea&s;y would it have been for them to invent &s;ome &s;uch rea&s;on for the appearance pre&s;ented to the view of the people, and a&s;cribe it to &s;ome infernal artifice?</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly.</HI> It may be inquired, if Je&s;us had appeared openly and publicly to the Jews, his enemies, after his re&s;urrec|tion, what additional evidence could we have derived from it? How &s;hould we have known that he thus appeared? If the Jews were &s;o full of malice as to try all in their power to de&s;troy chri&s;tianity, is it probable that they would have given their te&s;timony and left it on record, that they had &s;een Je&s;us alive again, af|ter his death? Such a thing could not have been expected. If they had left no &s;uch te&s;timony, then we mu&s;t have
<PB N="106" REF="028256_0104_0FD848BE65A45270">
received it from his friends and di&s;ci|ples, as we do now: We mu&s;t have de|pended on their credibility as we do now; and what addition could have been made to the evidence from their te&s;tify|ing that he had appeared to his enemies?</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, the malice of his enemies might have induced them to deny that they had &s;een him: They were certain|ly wicked enough to have done this. And, what if it had been recorded by &s;ome Jewi&s;h hi&s;torian; that the prie&s;ts and rulers of his nation, had openly de|nied that they had ever &s;een the ri&s;en Je|&s;us, when the apo&s;tles had te&s;tified the contrary? Here would have been a cla&s;h|ing of evidence, and the proof would have been weakened by it. For, if one witne&s;s appeals to another for the truth of any fact, and that other per&s;on de|nies it, the appeal is &s;o far from helping, that it injures the evidence very materi|ally, becau&s;e it will naturally be con|cluded, that one or the other is in the wrong. It is plain then, that the credibili|ty of this fact could not have been better
<PB N="107" REF="028256_0105_0FD848BE6B8AD5D8">
e&s;tabli&s;hed, but might have been e&s;&s;enti|ally injured, if the apo&s;tles had &s;aid that the enemies of Je&s;us had &s;een him after his re&s;urrection.</P>
<P>The truth is, that not the number, but the character of the witne&s;&s;es is mo&s;t to be regarded. If a few men can make it &s;ufficiently appear that what they &s;ay is true, there is as full evidence to a rea|&s;onable inquirer, as if the number were ever &s;o great. And, the ca&s;e before us is of &s;uch a nature, that we could not rea|&s;onably expect any evidence, but what is given us by the friends of Je&s;us; nor is there the lea&s;t nece&s;&s;ity for any other.

Let us take an example, familiar to our&s;elves. Do not we know, that on a certain day, in a certain year, of the pre&s;ent century, the delegates of the&s;e American &s;tates, in Congre&s;s a&s;&s;embled, declared them <HI>independent</HI>? Should any per&s;on now, or within a few years hence doubt this fact, may not an appeal be made to tho&s;e per&s;ons who were then living and acting in that great affair? Or, &s;hould any doubt be made a century, or &s;everal centuries hence, when all the pre&s;ent generation will be in their graves; may not an appeal be made to public re|cords, or to approved hi&s;tories, or to the annual celebration of the day on which the act was pa&s;&s;ed? And, will not this be rea&s;onable and convincing evidence? Ju&s;t &s;uch evidence we have that Je&s;us ro&s;e from the dead. It was a fact, &s;een and known, witne&s;&s;ed and believed, by per&s;ons who could not have mi&s;taken
<PB N="110" REF="028256_0109_0FD848C60CB1B1E0">
the fact; by numbers, by great numbers of them. There has been an authentic hi&s;tory of it written by eye-witne&s;&s;es, and pre&s;erved by their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, There has al&s;o been a familiar monument of it pre&s;erved among them; the fir&s;t day of every week is regarded as a day of reli|gious re&s;t and wor&s;hip; it has been, for almo&s;t eighteen centuries, invariably kept, and under&s;tood to be kept &s;acred, in memory of that great event. If any per&s;on in this age of the world &s;hould doubt the re&s;urrection of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, let him &s;eek &s;ome other rea&s;on for the ob&s;ervation of the Lord's day: Let him tell us when it began to be kept, and by whom, and for what purpo&s;e; and if he can give no other, or no more &s;atis|factory account of it, than is given in the books of the evangelical hi&s;torians, let him be a&s;hamed of doubting or he&s;itat|ing to admit the truth of that account.</P>
<P>As to the <HI>character</HI> of the witne&s;&s;es, let it be ob&s;erved, that they not only had full opportunity to know the truth and &s;atisfy them&s;elves of it; but it was a
<PB N="111" REF="028256_0110_0FD848C705677410">
matter which they did not at once believe. They did not under&s;tand the predictions of the prophets nor of Je&s;us him&s;elf; and therefore did not expect and were by no means prepared to believe the re|&s;urrection of their Lord before it hap|pened. It was as new and &s;urprizing to them, as if there had not been a word &s;poken concerning it. And, when the evidence of it was pre&s;ented to them, it was a long time before they were all con|vinced. They needed the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible, demon&s;trative proof: They exerci&s;ed their &s;en&s;es and their rea&s;on in examin|ing it; and after the mo&s;t full and criti|cal inquiry, they were convinced by "many infallible proofs."</P>
<P>The evidence &s;eems to have been com|municated to them, in proportion to the re&s;pective &s;trength and capacity of their minds. The fir&s;t appearance of Je&s;us was to Mary Magdalene; the &s;econd, which immediately followed it, was to the other Mary and her companions. The&s;e women were the mo&s;t zealous and affectionate friends of Je&s;us; and the
<PB N="112" REF="028256_0111_0FD848C896FA9180">
fir&s;t di&s;covery of him&s;elf to them was doubtle&s;s intended as a reward for their faithful attention to him in his la&s;t hours before his death. But, there might be another rea&s;on for it. The female mind is well known to be &s;udden in its deci|&s;ions: It does not &s;tay to inquire, to com|bine and compare ideas, and deduce con|clu&s;ions from various premi&s;es; but it &s;eizes its object at once, or in want of it, falls into agony and di&s;tre&s;s. In conde|&s;cention to this habit of acquiring truth, Je&s;us did not leave his female friends in doubt, but &s;atisfied them immediately of the truth of his re&s;urrection; and they received it with a tran&s;port of joy. Not &s;o was it with his other friends. John, the beloved di&s;ciple was indeed the fir&s;t who believed the re&s;urrection; but he was left to draw his conclu&s;ion from &s;everal premi&s;es: He &s;aw no angel, he heard no voice, he had no actual &s;ight of the ri&s;en Je&s;us; but, from comparing the &s;tate in which he found the &s;epul|chre, with what he remembered to have read in the &s;criptures, and with what
<PB N="113" REF="028256_0112_0FD848CDD6F51B10">
Je&s;us had &s;poken when he was alive, he drew his conclu&s;ion in favour of the re|&s;urrection of his ma&s;ter. Others had their doubts removed by degrees, and by different repre&s;entations of the evi|dence to their minds. Thus there was an exerci&s;e of rea&s;on in judging of the evidence, and the re&s;ult was conviction and faith. This is the right way of be|coming true believers.</P>
<P>If it be admitted that they believed the re&s;urrection and could not have been deceived in gaining this belief, the next inquiry is, what rea&s;on could they have for propagating the knowledge of it? Was it conducive to their temporal in|tere&s;t? No, they were poor before, and they had no pro&s;pect of making them|&s;elves rich, by oppo&s;ing the general &s;en|timent, of the ruling party among their nation. Was it calculated to make them famous and re&s;pected in the eyes of the world? For enough from this! Their doctrine was to the Jews a &s;tumb|ling-block&punc; and to the Greeks, fooli&s;hne&s;s. Was there any hope of their enjoying
<PB N="114" REF="028256_0113_0FD848CF4183DCF8">
ea&s;e and tranquility? No, their apo&s;tolio character expo&s;ed them to labour and travel; to be per&s;ecuted and impri&s;oned; to endure all kinds of &s;ufferings, to which human nature &s;ubmits with the utmo&s;t reluctance. Were they overheat|ed with enthu&s;ia&s;m? No men were more prudent and cautious and took more pains to avoid giving offence. Indeed their doctrine was contrary to the lu&s;ts and pa&s;&s;ions of mankind; and the &s;pirit by which they were animated, obliged them hone&s;tly and boldly to maintain their principles and te&s;tify what they knew to be the truth; and by the&s;e means much oppo&s;ition was excited a|gain&s;t them. The fault however lay not in them, but in their enemies. The religion which they preached and prac|ti&s;ed was full of love and good will to men; but it tended to di&s;turb and over|throw the fal&s;e opinions, the idolatrous wor&s;hip and the licentious morals, which had been long e&s;tabli&s;hed in the heathen world; as well as the formality and hypocri&s;y which reigned in the

Jewi&s;h nation; and therefore, all the policy and power of the prie&s;ts and ru|lers, fir&s;t among the Jews, and afterward among the Gentiles were oppo&s;ed to it. In the&s;e circum&s;tances, what inducement could the&s;e men have to undertake &s;uch a mighty work as to preach the go&s;pel <HI>to all nations</HI>? What, but a full convic|tion of its truth and importance, and a full expectation of receiving their re|ward, not in this but in a future &s;tate? That they had this expectation, and this alone to &s;upport and comfort their minds in the mid&s;t of their apo&s;tolic labours and &s;ufferings, we have the te&s;timony of one of the mo&s;t indefatigable of them, who in his admirable di&s;cour&s;e on the re&s;urrec|tion, &s;ays of him&s;elf and his brethren, "If in this life only, we have hope in Chri&s;t, we are of all men mo&s;t mi&s;era|ble." <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">.

<P N="1">1.

They give the chronology of the events which they relate; they tell us in who&s;e reign they happened, and who were Governours of the Roman Provinces, and they are found to agree in the&s;e circum&s;tances with contemporary writers, as far at lea&s;t, as tho&s;e writers agree with each other.</P>
<P N="3">3. If the evangelical hi&s;torians have te&s;tified things which no other hi&s;tori|ans have te&s;tified, it was becau&s;e no other

grand deci&s;ive proof is, his re&s;urrection from the dead.

<HEAD>ON THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE RESURREC|TION OF JESUS CHRIST, AND THE TRUTHS DEDUCIBLE FROM THE CERTAINTY OF THAT EVENT.</HEAD>
<P>JESUS Chri&s;t appealed to his re&s;urrection as the deci&s;ive proof of his divine mi&s;&s;ion and his apo&s;tles followed his example. They were &s;o &s;ure of the truth of this fact and &s;o fully per&s;uaded of its importance, that they &s;crupled not to ri&s;que the whole credit of their reli|gion upon it. They believed it, on the be&s;t evidence; they exhibited that evidence to others; they required the belief of this extraordinary fact as a nece&s;&s;ary term of di&s;ciple&s;hip; and, they had &s;uch a view of the connection between this and the other doctrines of chri&s;tianity, that they &s;crupled not to allow, that if this were fal&s;e, all the re&s;t was not worthy of regard. "If Chri&s;t be not ri&s;en,

(&s;aid Paul<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"> Cor. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"> v.14.</NOTE>) then is our preaching vain and your faith al&s;o is vain." The&s;e words fairly imply that if the doctrine of the re&s;urrection of Chri&s;t be true, then the preaching of the go&s;pel and the faith of chri&s;tians are of the highe&s;t importance, connected with and condu|cive to our eternal &s;alvation.</P>
<P>Having &s;tated and vindicated the evi|dence of this illu&s;trious fact, let us at|tend to the con&s;equences which follow from it.</P>
<P N="1">I. If the doctrine of the re&s;urrec|tion of Je&s;us Chri&s;t be true, then he was the promi&s;ed Me&s;&s;iah, the Saviour of the world.</P>
<P>In the &s;ame books which contain the evidence of his re&s;urrection, we have many of his di&s;cour&s;es, in &s;ome of which he declared in the mo&s;t &s;olemn manner, that his doctrine was not his own, but his who &s;ent him; that he &s;pake to the world tho&s;e things which he had heard of the father; that as the father had taught him &s;o he &s;pake; and in his la&s;t
<PB N="122" REF="028256_0120_0FD848E3082EECC8">
prayer with his di&s;ciples he appealed to the father in the&s;e words "I have given to them the words which thou gave&s;t me." Not only was his doctrine de|livered but his miracles were wrought by the &s;ame divine commi&s;&s;ion. "The works which I do, bear witne&s;s of me that I came from God." The&s;e mira|cles were wrought to prove the truth of his doctrine: They were direct appeals to the &s;en&s;es of mankind. Tho&s;e who &s;aw them, and e&s;pecially tho&s;e who ex|perienced the benefit of them mu&s;t have been forcibly convinced, that the per&s;on who wrought them was endowed with more than human power; and mu&s;t have been induced to attend to his teaching as the mo&s;t &s;erious and important truth.</P>
<P>If we regard the death of Chri&s;t as that of a martyr, confirming his te&s;ti|mony with his blood, this mu&s;t be ad|mitted as a weighty evidence of the truth of what he taught; e&s;pecially when we take into view his holy and exemplary life, and the wi&s;dom, meek|ne&s;s and humility which he di&s;covered
<PB N="123" REF="028256_0121_0FD848E440D1B398">
in his whole conduct. We cannot be|lieve, that &s;uch a per&s;on as he appears to have been would have ventured to die, in any cau&s;e but that of truth; and if we had no other te&s;timony than what ari&s;es from his miracles and his death, yet that would have been &s;ufficient to give credi|bility to the doctrines which he deliver|ed; but when in addition to this, we are a&s;&s;ured that God did, by a &s;pecial act of his power, rai&s;e this extraordinary per&s;on from death to life, exactly as he him&s;elf had predicted, we have the high|e&s;t po&s;&s;ible evidence, that he was &s;ent by God to enlighten and reform the world both by his doctrine and his example.</P>
<P>But there was &s;omething beyond this in the de&s;ign of his death; &s;omething which was prefigured in the Levitical &s;acrifices, where an innocent creature, without &s;pot or blemi&s;h, was offered to God in behalf of trangre&s;&s;ors. In al|lu&s;ion to this he is &s;aid to have been <HI>of|fered</HI> to God, to be <HI>&s;acrificed</HI> for us and to <HI>die for our &s;ins.</HI> It is certain that he did not die for any &s;in of his own; and
<PB N="124" REF="028256_0122_0FD848E75F64B288">
it is equally certain that no man could have taken away his life, and that death could have had no power over him, with|out his own con&s;ent. But he offered him|&s;elf to God, that he might &s;o take away &s;in, as that God might be "ju&s;t and yet ju&s;tify the &s;inner who believes in him."</P>
<P>This great event, the death of Chri&s;t, and the particular purpo&s;e for which he died&punc; were foreknown and predetermin|ed by God, before the world was made. This eternal purpo&s;e was revealed as early as the days of Adam; it was the &s;ub&s;tance of the Levitical &s;acrifices; it was the &s;ubject of &s;everal direct prophe|cies; it was as capital and e&s;&s;ential a truth in the &s;criptures of the old as it is in tho&s;e of the new Te&s;tament. It may therefore be truly &s;aid "that Chri&s;t died for our &s;ins, <HI>according to the &s;criptures.</HI>"</P>
<P>Among the enemies of Chri&s;t and his religion, his death was reckoned a di&s;|grace to the chri&s;tian cau&s;e. That the founder of a religious &s;y&s;tem, who pro|fe&s;&s;ed that he was &s;ent from God, &s;hould be put to death as a malefactor, was a
<PB N="125" REF="028256_0123_0FD848E8E78566B0">
thing which in their opinion di&s;graced his character and overthrew the merit of his preten&s;ions. This cavil of the ene|mies of chri&s;tianity had &s;uch an effect on &s;ome weak profe&s;&s;ors, as to induce them to deny the death of Chri&s;t, and to invent &s;ome fabulous and ab&s;urd in|terpretations of that part of the go&s;pel hi&s;tory, to remove the &s;candal, which they imagined was ca&s;t on their religion by that event. But the apo&s;tles, who were perfectly in&s;tructed in the religion of their divine ma&s;ter, were &s;o far from wi&s;hing to deny or evade this matter, that they e&s;tabli&s;hed the fact, and open|ly preached that Chri&s;t died, and that he died for our &s;ins; without this, there could not be any foundation for the par|don of them; and without the ignominy of the cro&s;s, there could be no founda|tion for the glory of the re&s;urrection.</P>
<P>The crucifixion and death of Je&s;us then are to be con&s;idered as the direct way to his exaltation. "Becau&s;e he humbled him&s;elf and became obedient to death, even the death of the cro&s;s
<PB N="126" REF="028256_0124_0FD848EA4268ED98">
therefore God hath highly exalted him and given him a name which is above every name, that in the name of Je&s;us every knee &s;hould bow, and every tongue confe&s;s him Lord, to the glory of God the father."</P>
<P N="2">II. It follows from the truth of our Lord's re&s;urrection, that his apo&s;tles were divinely commi&s;&s;ioned, to preach the go&s;|pel through the world. The &s;ame books, which contain the evidence of his re&s;ur|rection, give us an account of the com|mi&s;&s;ion which he gave to his apo&s;tles; by which he provided in the mo&s;t proper and effectual way for the continuance of his religion in the world. It was not intended that <HI>his</HI> vi&s;it to this world &s;hould be of any longer continuance than was nece&s;&s;ary to e&s;tabli&s;h and con|firm the truth of his divine mi&s;&s;ion, and lay a &s;ure foundation for our hope of enjoying the benefits of pardon and im|mortality. It was fit and right that his voluntary humiliation &s;hould be reward|ed with the highe&s;t honours, and that he &s;hould return in triumph to that glo|rious
<PB N="127" REF="028256_0125_0FD848ED658587A0">
world from whence he came. But it was equally nece&s;&s;ary that his religion &s;hould be propagated in this world. His per&s;onal mini&s;try was confined to "the lo&s;t &s;heep of the hou&s;e of I&s;rael;" but he had "other &s;heep which were not of that fold," and it was nece&s;&s;ary that "they al&s;o &s;hould be brought in, that there might be one fold and one &s;hepherd." Accordingly when he &s;pake of the effect of his death he &s;aid, "If I be lifted up from the earth, I will draw all men to me." The commi&s;&s;ion given to his apo&s;tles was expre&s;&s;ed in the mo&s;t univer&s;al terms, "Go ye into all the world and preach the go&s;pel to every creature." "Go ye and teach all na|tions." "As my father hath &s;ent me &s;o &s;end I you." The apo&s;tles under|&s;tood their commi&s;&s;ion in this exten&s;ive &s;en&s;e and accordingly each one took his di&s;trict and travelled over that part of the world which fell to his lot. Whence we may conclude, that it was the will of Chri&s;t, that during the fir&s;t and pure&s;t age; the knowledge of the truth &s;hould
<PB N="128" REF="028256_0126_0FD848EEEB1A4188">
be propagated through the world, ac|companied with the &s;ame evidence which was exhibited before the eyes of the Jews. The impartial regard which God had to all men would not &s;uffer him to confine the&s;e "glad tidings of great joy" to any particular nation. As he is no re&s;pecter of per&s;ons, and would have all men &s;aved, and come to the knowledge of the truth, &s;o the me&s;&s;en|gers of truth were &s;ent forth to com|mand all men every where to repent</P>
<P>Different people treated the go&s;pel differently. To &s;ome it was a "&s;avour of life to life; to others of death to death." Some have pre&s;erved &s;ome parts of the religion of Je&s;us pure, whil&s;t they have corrupted other parts; &s;ome have pre&s;erved what others have corrupt|ed, and &s;ome have lo&s;t both the name and the power of it. The&s;e differences are to be a&s;cribed to various cau&s;es; ignorance, &s;uper&s;tition, impo&s;ture, bigo|try, covetou&s;ne&s;s, pride, inva&s;ion, per|&s;ecution and tyranny have in their re&s;|pective degrees contributed to mar the
<PB N="129" REF="028256_0127_0FD848F065837C30">
glory of the chri&s;tian religion and deface the purity of its in&s;titutions; but not|with&s;tanding the combination or preva|lency of the&s;e cau&s;es, yet we may re&s;t a&s;&s;ured that as the chri&s;tian religion has not been lo&s;t, &s;o "the gates of hell &s;hall never prevail again&s;t it."</P>
<P N="3">III. From the truth of the re&s;urrec|tion of Je&s;us Chri&s;t we deduce the <HI>divine authority</HI> of the books of the <HI>new</HI> Te&s;ta|ment. The apo&s;tles were mortal as well as other men. Had there been no provi&s;ion for a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of teachers, nor any authentic &s;tandard of doctrine, pre|&s;erved and e&s;tabli&s;hed in the chri&s;tian church, the religion of the go&s;pel would not have &s;urvived the fir&s;t age; but it was intended for a <HI>durable</HI> religion; not to be worn out or di&s;u&s;ed, but to la&s;t forever. It was not de&s;igned for any one age or place, or for any one parti|cular cla&s;s or denomination of men; but for mankind univer&s;ally. It has its foun|dation in the rational nature of man: It applies to his under&s;tanding, judgment, con&s;cience, will and affections; and it
<PB N="130" REF="028256_0128_0FD848F1C9EDA040">
regards all men equally. It is a religion which has produced converts from heatheni&s;m and judai&s;m; from every &s;pecies of idolatry and &s;uper&s;tition in the world: It is adapted to all countries and to all climates: It teaches mankind every where, the &s;ame truths to be believed; the &s;ame duties to be practi&s;ed; the &s;ame examples to be imitated; the &s;ame mo|tives to influence their conduct; and, it &s;ets before them the &s;ame hopes and pro&s;pects to animate them in doing and &s;uffering the will of God.</P>
<P>This being the nature and de&s;ign of the religion of Chri&s;t it was highly pro|per and nece&s;&s;ary that it &s;hould be com|mitted to <HI>writing;</HI> and that copies of what was written &s;hould be pre&s;erved; &s;o that &s;ucceeding ages might enjoy the benefit of what was delivered by Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tles.</P>
<P>Accordingly we find that there are books pre&s;erved and handed down to us, which have been acknowledged as au|thentic by chri&s;tians of ancient and mo|dern times; by chri&s;tians of different
<PB N="131" REF="028256_0129_0FD848F4E61B4790">
&s;ects and parties; who, though they have differed widely in their &s;entiments, re&s;pecting &s;ome of the doctrines taught in the&s;e writings, yet have con&s;tantly appealed to them as the &s;tandard of truth; and their mutual jealou&s;y has made them &s;o watchful of each other, that no material alteration could have been introduced into the&s;e books, with|out being detected, by one party or a|nother. Since the art of printing has been di&s;covered, the mo&s;t &s;crupulous care has been taken to have the&s;e books correct; and whil&s;t there is a &s;pirit of inquiry prevailing and opportunity given to all, to &s;earch, and judge for them&s;elves, there can be no danger of any per&s;on be|ing impo&s;ed upon, with regard to the &s;en&s;e of &s;cripture.</P>
<P>From the&s;e con&s;iderations, we may be &s;atisfied on good grounds, that the books delivered to us as the writings of the apo&s;tles and evangeli&s;ts are genuine and authentic; written as they were di|rected by the <HI>&s;pirit of truth;</HI> which Je&s;us Chri&s;t promi&s;ed to &s;end into the
<PB N="132" REF="028256_0130_0FD81B608D977E00">
world after his a&s;cention to the right hand of the father.</P>
<P>It is not however pretended that the in|&s;piration by which the new Te&s;tament was written extended to particular words and phra&s;es, and modes of &s;peech. There is a diver&s;ity of &s;tyle among the &s;acred writers, according to each one's natural gift and particular genius and di&s;po|&s;ition. But what is meant by in&s;pira|tion is, that there was &s;uch a &s;uperin|tending divine influence with the &s;acred writers as brought to their remembrance what they had &s;een and heard of our Lord's di&s;cour&s;es and of his life and actions; and pre&s;erved them from committing any material error in the repre&s;entation which they have given us of the truths of chri&s;tianity. Nor is this idea of divine in&s;piration to be under&s;tood as if every matter or thing which is occa&s;ionally mentioned in the writings of the apo&s;tles, were guided and governed by the divine &s;pirit. It is evident that &s;ometimes the apo&s;tles give their own private opinions, on certain points; at other times they
<PB N="133" REF="028256_0131_0FD848F88E52CF20">
introduce &s;alutations to their friends; or give directions about common affairs; as particularly where Paul directs Timothy to bring the <HI>cloke</HI> which he left at Troas, with the books and parchments; and advi&s;es him to drink <HI>wine</HI> with <HI>water</HI> for the &s;ake of his health. The&s;e things are brought in incidentally, in familar epi&s;tles, and &s;how that the apo&s;tles were men in &s;imilar circum&s;tances with other men; having the &s;ame infirmities and wants as our&s;elves. But the&s;e &s;mall matters do not detract from the value and importance of tho&s;e dignified &s;enti|ments, and &s;ublime de&s;criptions which are given in other parts of the &s;ame writings; of which there is one of the mo&s;t noble &s;pecimens in the 15th chap|ter of the 1&s;t, Epi&s;tle to the Corinthians. No per&s;on can read this chapter, with any proper degree of attention, without being forcibly &s;truck with the &s;ingular|ity and &s;ublimity of the &s;ubject, and the eloquence and pathos of the language; all which together &s;trongly mark it as a di&s;cour&s;e written under the direction
<PB N="134" REF="028256_0132_0FD848FACAF14118">
of that holy &s;pirit which &s;earcheth the <HI>deep things</HI> of God; which unveils the glories of the future &s;tate; and penetrates into tho&s;e things which eye could not have &s;een, nor ear heard, nor could have entered into the heart of men, unle&s;s God had taught them to us by the mini&s;try of his Son and his &s;pirit.</P>
<P N="4">IV. Another deduction which we make from the doctrine of the re&s;urrec|tion of Je&s;us, is, that the &s;criptures of the <HI>Old Te&s;tament</HI> contain <HI>divine reve|lations.</HI></P>
<P>If there were no other proof of this, it would be &s;ufficient to re&s;t the truth of it upon the credit of Je&s;us Chri&s;t and that of his apo&s;tles. For if it be allow|ed that he came with a divine commi&s;|&s;ion to declare the truth of God, and that he commi&s;&s;ioned them to propagate the &s;ame truth; and if it be certain that both he and they appealed to the writings of Mo&s;es and the prophets, as &s;acred, au|thentic books, acknowledged as &s;uch by the Jewi&s;h church; if he and they quot|ed the predictions therein contained, and
<PB N="135" REF="028256_0133_0FD848FB8649B9D8">
applied them to occa&s;ions and events, in that age in which they lived; then we have the highe&s;t authority for believing that tho&s;e books contain revelations of the mind and will of God, who &s;pake at &s;undry times and in divers manners, to the fathers, by the prophets. The&s;e predictions refer to a multitude of events, &s;ome of which are &s;o &s;ingular and unex|ampled, that no human penetration could have fore&s;een or even imagined them; but yet we have the mo&s;t credible evi|dence of their exact fulfilment. One of them is that great event, the re&s;urrection of Je&s;us Chri&s;t; for the language of the New Te&s;tament is, that he ro&s;e again, <HI>according to the &s;criptures.</HI> If therefore he ro&s;e from the dead, then the prophecies of the Old Te&s;tament, which foretold this among other great events, were writ|ten by in&s;piration of God. Be&s;ides this, it is to be ob&s;erved, that there is &s;uch a connection between the chri&s;tian and the Jewi&s;h religions, that if one be true the other is true al&s;o. They are both parts of one plan, the one contains the &s;had|ow
<PB N="136" REF="028256_0134_0FD848FF58BFAD98">
and the other the &s;ub&s;tance; one is the letter and the other the &s;pirit. The Jewi&s;h religion cannot be properly un|der&s;tood without the chri&s;tian; which &s;hows the fulfilment of many things, pre|dicted and typified, under that ancient di&s;pen&s;ation; as any one may be fully &s;atisfied by peru&s;ing the epi&s;tle to the Hebrews, written by a learned Jew, brought up in the &s;chool of Gamaliel, but better in&s;tructed by Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P N="5">V. It al&s;o follows from the re&s;ur|rection of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, that the re&s;urrection of the dead is the only true doctrine of <HI>immortality.</HI></P>
<P>The heathen world had no clear ideas of futurity. Some of their wi&s;e&s;t men had a notion of the immortality of the <HI>&s;oul,</HI> con&s;idered as &s;eparate from the body or of its pa&s;&s;ing into and animating oth|er bodies; but they had no idea of the re&s;urrection of the body to life. So ig|norant were the wi&s;e&s;t of them on this point, that when Paul preached <HI>Je&s;us</HI> and the <HI>re&s;urrection</HI> at Athens, they cal|led him "a &s;etter forth of &s;trange <HI>Gods,</HI>"
<PB N="137" REF="028256_0135_0FD84900C1886520">
&s;uppo&s;ing <HI>Je&s;us</HI> to be the name of one, and <HI>Ana&s;ta&s;is</HI> (the Greek word for re|&s;urrection) to be the name of another. And even with re&s;pect to the immortal|ity of the &s;oul, their notions were confu&s;|ed, and their proofs vague and inconclu|&s;ive. Socrates, though he u&s;ed a varie|ty of arguments in &s;upport of this doc|trine yet told his di&s;ciples, "that if the proofs which he offered, &s;hould appear in&s;ufficient, it would be nece&s;&s;ary for them to &s;earch for others that would be more &s;atisfactory." Cicero, though he endeavoured with all the force of his genius to a&s;&s;ert the doctrine of immor|tality, yet declared "that his belief of it was founded more on the plea&s;ure of the pro&s;pect, than on the conviction of his mind from the arguments u&s;ed in its favour."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Blacklock's Paracle&s;is, page 297.</NOTE> The truth is, they had &s;ome &s;ublime ideas of God, and of the nature of the human &s;oul; and they could not bear to think that God would create &s;uch a noble being, to live only a &s;hort time, in this world and then die
<PB N="138" REF="028256_0136_0FD84904E5B0E530">
with the body. Hence they were led to frame arguments and conjectures, re&s;|pecting the <HI>probability</HI> of the &s;oul's fu|ture exi&s;tence and immortality, which they wi&s;hed might prove true; and it is &s;aid that Plato intimated his expectation that God would &s;ome time or other make this matter <HI>certain,</HI> by a revelation to mankind. Such were the ancient <HI>Dei&s;ts</HI>; "they &s;et them&s;elves to prove the reali|ty of a future &s;tate; and caught at every thing which had the &s;hadow of proba|bility; they were &s;en&s;ible of the need of &s;uch a doctrine, and gave a degree of plau&s;ibility to the arguments in its favour." Yet it is certain that the true doctrine, of immortality was never brought to lights, but by the re&s;urrection of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. By that great event we are in&s;tructed, that the go&s;pel hope of immortality is a re&s;urrection of the body from death; and a reunion of the &s;oul to it, never more to be &s;eparated; "that this corruptible &s;hall put on in|corruption, and this mortal &s;hall put on immortality and then &s;hall be brought to
<PB N="139" REF="028256_0137_0FD849072C52A248">
pa&s;s the &s;aying that is written, death is &s;wallowed up in victory."</P>
<P>The go&s;pel indeed does not give us a circum&s;tantial and particular detail of the employments and entertainments of the future &s;tate, as did &s;ome of the an|cient poets who believed the &s;oul's im|mortality, and as did Mahomet; who framed his &s;y&s;tem agreeable to the ta&s;te and di&s;po&s;ition of the people who were to receive it for truth. Divine revelation gives us an a&s;&s;urance and a pledge of im|mortality, by which the certainty of it is e&s;tabli&s;hed; but its bli&s;sful &s;cenes are &s;o tran&s;cendently &s;ublime and glori|ous as to &s;urpa&s;s the power of de&s;crip|tion, and therefore we are only told "it doth not yet appear what we &s;hall be, but when he, who is our life, &s;hall ap|pear, we &s;hall be like him; for we &s;hall &s;ee him as he is!"</P>
<P>Our bu&s;ine&s;s then is not to pry into the &s;ecrets of the future &s;tate, but to pre|pare for it; to imitate tho&s;e graces and virtues which appeared in Chri&s;t, if we expect to have "our bodies fa&s;hioned
<PB N="140" REF="028256_0138_0FD8490859E1D6D8">
like his glorious body," and to comfort our&s;elves, and one another with the ble&s;&s;ed hope of being "changed into his image from glory to glory." <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
