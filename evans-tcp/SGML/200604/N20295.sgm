<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE following little Poem was publi&s;hed in London, in February <HI>1792.</HI> It happened that two of the principal con|&s;pirators, the emperor Leopold, and the king of Sweden, died in a few weeks after. The oppo&s;ite effects, produced by the death of the&s;e two per&s;ons, are very remarkable. From a view of the general character of the king of Sweden, and of the particular tran&s;actions of the la&s;t year of his life, there can be no doubt but he has determined to go any lengths with the powers which were then confederating again&s;t the liberty of France; and it is a con&s;olation to human nature, that the violent death of one &s;ceptred mad-man has &s;aved the people of Sweden from tho&s;e hor|rid &s;cenes of &s;laughter which now involve mo&s;t of the neighbour|ing nations.</P>
<P>The character of Leopold, in &s;ome of its leading traits, was
<PB N="vi" REF="026618_0004_0FD2253CDD0949E0">
directly the rever&s;e of that of Gu&s;tavus. The latter was prod|igal of wealth, and exce&s;&s;ively eager for what is called military fame, without the capacity or the means of acquiring it; the former was affectedly pacific, moderate in mo&s;t of his vices, and remarkable for nothing but his avarice. He had &s;en&s;e enough to &s;ee that nothing was to be gained by a war with France; his avarice, had he lived, would have been a &s;ufficient guar|antee again&s;t that event; and his death may be con&s;idered as the immediate cau&s;e of the war.</P>
<P>The treaty of Pilnitz was doubtle&s;s fabricated in the court of Paris. The emperor agreed to it, for the purpo&s;e of duping the king of Pru&s;&s;ia into mea&s;ures which might &s;ecure the obedi|ence of the people of Brabant, whom he had pacified the year before by a cruel deception. His de&s;ign was likewi&s;e to deceive the emigrant princes, who were then deceiving him; and to exhibit &s;uch a menacing appearance, as, according to his cal|culation, would induce the French people to &s;et down quietly under a limited monarchy; well knowing that, if they did this, their government would &s;oon degenerate into a de&s;poti&s;m, which would continue to give countenance to the general principle that had &s;o long en&s;laved the nations of Europe.</P>
<P>That he never intended, or had relinqui&s;hed the intention, of executing the conditions of the treaty of Pilnitz by going to war with France, is evident from the following con&s;iderations: the French con&s;titution was ratified, and the revolution &s;uppo|&s;ed to be fini&s;hed, in September <HI>1791.</HI> A war, to overturn
<PB N="vii" REF="026618_0005_0FD2253F76B52468">
that con&s;titution, certainly ought not to have been deferred be|yond the en&s;uing &s;pring; and as it would require an army of two or three hundred thou&s;and men, the winter mu&s;t have been occupied in making the preparations. Leopold died &s;uddenly, about the fir&s;t of March. At that time no preparations had been made for offen&s;ive ho&s;tilities. The number of troops &s;ent from Au&s;tria into the Low Countries, during the autumn and winter, was not more than was &s;tipulated to be maintained there, and were &s;carcely &s;ufficient to enforce the de&s;poti&s;m to which he had de&s;tined that unhappy people. Before the death of Leo|pold, the French emigrants at Coblentz began to de&s;pair. The hopes they had built on the treaty of Pilnitz had nearly van|i&s;hed; the princes had an army of forty thou&s;and gentlemen to maintain; Louis was carrying on too great a &s;y&s;tem of corrup|tion at home, to be able to &s;upply them with money from his <HI>civil li&s;t;</HI> they had exhau&s;ted their credit in all the mercan|tile towns in Europe; and Leopold, con&s;idering them in the character of beggars, began to treat them as trouble&s;ome gue&s;ts; for none of the objects of their demands could be flattering to his favourite pa&s;&s;ion. At la&s;t, to their great &s;atisfaction, the emperor died; and his &s;y&s;tem with regard to France was either never under&s;tood by his own mini&s;ters; or it was laid a&s;ide, in compliance with the predominant pa&s;&s;ions of his &s;on; which happened to be for war, expence, and unqualified de&s;poti&s;m.</P>
<P>This young man began his career by a &s;olemn declaration to all the powers of Europe, that he &s;hould follow preci&s;ely the &s;y&s;t|em
<PB N="viii" REF="026618_0006_0FD22540C92BA800">
of his father, with re&s;pect to the affairs of France. This de|claration might be under&s;tood to mean the open and avowed &s;y&s;tem, pre&s;cribed by the treaty of Pilnitz, or the &s;ecret and un|explained &s;y&s;tem, which was to avoid the war. It was univer|&s;ally under&s;tood, as it was doubtle&s;s meant, in favour of the a|vowed &s;y&s;tem; who&s;e object, announced in the treaty, was "<HI>to &s;upport the rights of crowns.</HI>"</P>
<P>From this moment, a &s;pirit of ho&s;tility was provoked by the Court of Vienna, and encouraged by the French amba&s;&s;ador there, who, like their other amba&s;&s;adors, was betraying the nation, to &s;erve the king; till, on the <HI>20</HI>th of April, war was declared by the National A&s;&s;embly. In this war the de&s;|pots of Europe will try their &s;trength, and will probably &s;oon be exhau&s;ted.</P>

A Duke of Cumberland, in order to become an Alexander, had to ride all the way to Culloden, and back again to London. Louis the Fourteenth was obliged to &s;ubmit to the fatigue of being carried on board of a &s;plendid barge, and row|ed acro&s;s the Rhine, about the &s;ame time that the French army cro&s;|ed it; and all this for the &s;imple privilege of being placed above the Macedonian in the temple of Fame, and of cau&s;ing this atchievement to be celebrated, as more glorious than the pa&s;&s;ing of the Granicus; as may be &s;een on that mode&s;t monument in the <HI>Place vendome</HI> in Paris.</P>

<HEAD>Note on Mr. Burke, referring to page 17.</HEAD>
<P>* Some of the author's friends in England, although they join with him in cen&s;uring the writings of Mr. Burke on the French Revolu|tion, are of opinion that the picture here drawn of that writer is too highly coloured; or at lea&s;t, that the cen&s;ure is &s;o &s;evere as to lo&s;e the effect that it might otherwi&s;e produce. It is impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ay what effect, and whether any, has or will be produced by this poem; but, out of re&s;pect to the opinion above &s;tated, it may be proper to make &s;ome ob&s;ervations on the effect that has already followed from the writings of Mr. Burke. I &s;peak not of what has taken place in England; where it is &s;uppo&s;ed that, contrary to his intentions and tho&s;e of the government that &s;et him at work, his malicious attack upon liberty has opened a di&s;cu&s;&s;ion which cannot be clo&s;ed until the whole &s;y&s;tem of de&s;poti&s;m, which he meant to &s;upport, &s;hall be over|turned in that country. The pre&s;ent war with France is doubtle&s;s the la&s;t piece of delu&s;ion that a &s;et of hereditary tyrants will ever be able to impo&s;e upon the people of England.</P>
<P>But this &s;ubject opens a field of contemplation far more &s;erious and exten&s;ive on the continent of Europe; where if Mr. Burke can view without horror the immen&s;ity of the mi&s;chiefs he has done, he will &s;how him&s;elf worthy of much higher attributes of wickedne&s;s than have yet been a&s;cribed to him. It is a painful ta&s;k to traver&s;e &s;uch a wide &s;cene of &s;laughter and de&s;olation as now involves the nations of Europe, and then to lay it all to the charge of a &s;ingle individual; e&s;pecially when we con&s;ider that individual as having for a long time before, enjoyed the confidence of all good men, and having at la&s;t be|trayed it from the wor&s;t and vile&s;t motives; as he had e&s;tabli&s;hed his previous reputation by &s;peaking the language of liberty, and profe&s;|&s;ing him&s;elf to be the friend of national felicity. But it is not from a tran&s;itory di&s;gu&s;t at his dete&s;tible principles, it is from deliberate ob&s;ervation and mature conviction, that I &s;tate it as an hi&s;torical fact, That the pre&s;ent war, with all its train of calamities, mu&s;t be attribu|ted almo&s;t exclu&s;ively to the pen of Mr. Burke.</P>
<P>There is a peculiar combination of circum&s;tances which threw this
<PB N="26" REF="026618_0024_0FD22575EEFA5A18">
power into his hands, and which ought to be duly con&s;idered, before we come to a deci&s;ion on the &s;ubject. The people of England had enjoyed for &s;everal ages a much greater portion of liberty than any other people in Europe. This had rai&s;ed them to a great degree of eminence in many re&s;pects. At the &s;ame time that it rendered them powerful as a nation, it made them &s;ober, indu&s;trious and per&s;evering, as individuals; it taught them to think and &s;peak with a certain air of dignity, independence and preci&s;ion, which was unknown in other countries. This circum&s;tance could not fail to gain the admiration of foreigners and to excite a perpetual emulation among them&s;elves. England has therefore produced more than her proportion of the il|lu&s;trious men of modern times, e&s;pecially in politics and legi&s;lation, as the&s;e affairs came within the reach of a larger cla&s;s of men in that country than in any other.</P>
<P>In a nation where there is an enormous civil li&s;t at the di&s;po&s;al of the crown, and a con&s;titutional &s;pirit of liberty kept alive in the peo|ple we mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily expect to find two parties in the government. In &s;uch a ca&s;e, as the king is &s;ure to carry all the mea&s;ures that he dares to propo&s;e, the party in favour of the people are called the <HI>op|po&s;ition;</HI> and it being always a minority, it gives occa&s;ion for great exertion of talents, and is &s;uppo&s;ed to be the nur&s;e of every public virtue. Such has been the compo&s;ition of the Engli&s;h government ever &s;ince the la&s;t revolution. The oppo&s;ition has been the &s;chool of great men; its principle di&s;ciples have been the apo&s;tles of liberty; and their exertions have made the Briti&s;h name re&s;pectable in every part of the world. Mr. Burke had been for many years at the head of this &s;chool; and from the brilliant talents he <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">covered in that con|&s;picuous &s;tation, he rendered him&s;elf univer&s;ally re&s;pected. His elo|quence was of that flowery and figurative kind, which attract|ed great admiration in foreign countries; where it was viewed, for the mo&s;t part, through the medium of a tran&s;lation; &s;o that he was con&s;idered, at lea&s;t in every country out of England, as the able&s;t ad|vocate of liberty that then exi&s;ted in Europe. Even kings and tyrants,
<PB N="27" REF="026618_0025_0FD2257967554A48">
who hated the cau&s;e, could not withhold their veneration from the man.</P>
<P>Under the&s;e impre&s;&s;ions, their attention was called to the great e|vent of the French revolution. It was a &s;ubject which they did not under&s;tand, a bu&s;ine&s;s in which they had no intention to interfere; as it was evidently no concern of theirs. But viewed as a &s;peculative point, it is as natural for kings as for other per&s;ons to wait till they learn what great men have &s;aid, before they form their opinion. Mr. Burke did not &s;uffer them to remain long in &s;u&s;pence; but, to en|lighten their under&s;tandings and teach them how to judge, he came forward with his "<HI>Reflections on the Revolution in France</HI>;" where, in his quality of the political &s;choolma&s;ter of his age, in his quality of the profe&s;&s;ed enemy of tyrants, the friend of the people, the mo&s;t en|lightened leader of the mo&s;t enlightened nation in Europe, he tells them that this Revolution is an abominable u&s;urpation of a gang of beggarly tyrants; that its principle is athei&s;m and anarchy; that its in&s;truments are murders, rapes, and plunders; that its object is to hunt down religion, overturn &s;ociety, and deluge the world in blood.&mdash; Then, in the whining cant of &s;tate-piety, and in the cowardly in&s;o|lence of per&s;onal &s;afety, he calls upon the principal &s;overeigns of Eu|rope to unite in a general confederation, to march into France, to in|terfere in the affairs of an independent power&punc; to make war with the principles which he him&s;elf had long laboured to &s;upport, to over|turn the noble&s;t monument of human wi&s;dom, and bla&s;t the faire&s;t hopes of public happine&s;s that the world had ever &s;een.</P>
<P>Copies of his book were &s;ent in great profu&s;ion by the courts of London and Paris to the other courts of Europe; it was read by all men of letters, and by all men of &s;tate, with an avidity in&s;pired by the celebrity of the author and the magnitude of the &s;ubject; and it produced an effect which, in other circum&s;tances would have appear|ed almo&s;t miraculous; e&s;pecially when we con&s;ider the intrin&s;ic char|acter of the work. M. de Calonne, about the &s;ame time, publi&s;hed a book of much more internal merit; a book in which fal&s;hood is
<PB N="28" REF="026618_0026_0FD2257C27A5FA88">
clothed in a more decent covering; and in which there is more ener|gy and argument, to excite the champions of de&s;poti&s;m to begin the work of de&s;olation. But Calonne wrote and appeared in his true char|acter. It was known that he had been a robber in France, and was now an exile in England; and, while he herded with the Engli&s;h rob|bers at St. James's, he wrote to revenge him&s;elf upon the country who&s;e ju&s;tice he had e&s;caped. His writings, therefore, had but little weight; perhaps as little as Mr. Burke's would have had, if his real object had been known.</P>
<P>But this illu&s;trious hypocrite po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed every advantage for decep|tion. He palmed him&s;elf upon the world as a volunteer in the gene|ral cau&s;e of philanthropy. Giving him&s;elf up to the frenzy of an unbridled imagination, he conceives him&s;elf writing tragedy, with|out being confined to the obvious laws of fiction; and taking advan|tage of the recency of the events, and of the ignorance of tho&s;e who were to read his rhap&s;odies, he peoples France with a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins, for the &s;ake of rai&s;ing a hue-and-cry again&s;t its peaceable inhabitants; he paints ideal murders, that they may be avenged by the reality of a wide extended &s;laughter; he transforms the milde&s;t and mo&s;t generous people in Europe into a nation of mon&s;ters and athei&s;ts, "heaping mountains upon mountains, and waging war with heaven," that he may intere&s;t the con&s;ciences of one part of his readers, and cloak the hypocri&s;y of another, to induce them both to renounce the char|acter of men, while they avenge the cau&s;e of God.</P>
<P>Such was the fir&s;t picture of the French Revolution pre&s;ented at once to the eyes of all the men who held the reins of government in the &s;everal &s;tates of Europe; and &s;uch was the authority of the author by whom it was pre&s;ented, that we are not to be a&s;toni&s;hed at the ef|fect. The emigrant princes, and the agents of the court of the Thu<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">|leries, who were then be&s;ieging the anti-chambers of mini&s;ters in eve|ry country, found a new &s;ource of impudence in this extraordinary work. They found their own invented fictions confirmed in their ful|le&s;t latitude, and a rich variety of &s;uperadded fal&s;hood, of which the
<PB N="29" REF="026618_0027_0FD2257F26AE1D68">
mo&s;t &s;hamele&s;s &s;ycophant of Louis or of Cond&eacute; would hare blu&s;hed to have been the author. With this book in their hands it was ea&s;y to gain the ear of men already predi&s;po&s;ed to li&s;ten to any project which might rivet the chains of their fellow creatures.</P>
<P>The&s;e arguments, detailed by proper agents, induced &s;ome of the principal &s;overeigns of Europe to agree to the treaty of Pilnitz; then the death of Leopold, as I have &s;tated in the preface, unhappily re|moved the great ob&s;tacle to the execution of that treaty, and the war of Mr. Burke was let loo&s;e, with all the horrors he intended to ex|cite. And what is the language proper to be u&s;ed in de&s;cribing the character of a man, who, in his &s;ituation, at his time of life, and for a pen&s;ion of only fifteen hundred pounds a year, could &s;it down de|liberately in his clo&s;et and call upon the powers of earth and hell to inflict &s;uch a weight of mi&s;ery on the human race? When we &s;ee Al|exander depopulating kingdoms and reducing great cities to a&s;hes, we tran&s;port our&s;elves to the age in which he lived, when human &s;laugh|ter was human glory; and we make &s;ome allowance for the ravings of ambition. If we contemplate the frightful cruelties of Cortez and Pizarro, we view their characters as a compo&s;ition of avarice and fan|atici&s;m; we &s;ee them in&s;atiable of wealth, and mad with the idea of extending the knowledge of their religion. But here is a man who calls him&s;elf a philo&s;opher, not remarkable for his avarice, the delight and ornament of a numerous &s;ociety of valuable friends, re&s;pected by all enlightened men as a friend of peace and a preacher of humanity, living in an age when military madne&s;s has lo&s;t its charms, and men begin to unite in &s;earching the means of avoiding the horrors of war; this man, wearied with the happine&s;s that &s;urrounds him, and di&s;gu&s;t|ed at the glory that awaits him, renounces all his friends, belies the doctrines of his former life, bewails that the military &s;avagene&s;s of the fourteenth century is pa&s;t away, and, to gratify his barbarous wi&s;hes to call it back, conjures up a war, in which at lea&s;t two millions of his fellow creatures mu&s;t be &s;acrificed to his unaccountable pa&s;&s;ion. Such is the condition of human nature, that the greate&s;t crimes have u&s;ual|ly
<PB N="30" REF="026618_0028_0FD22580973A9820">
gone unpuni&s;hed. It appears to me, that hi&s;tory does not furni&s;h a greater one than this of Mr. Burke; and yet all the con&s;olation that we can draw from the detection, is to leave the man to his own re|flections, and expo&s;e his conduct to the execration of po&s;terity.</P>
