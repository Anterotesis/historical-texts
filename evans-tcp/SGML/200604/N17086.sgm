<P>Yes, Sir, *****&mdash;I &s;u&s;pect him to be the author, but wi&s;h to be convinced before I proceed to extremities; You can have no ade|quate conceptions, Sir, of my &s;ufferings; I am witheld, by <HI>extreme delicacy,</HI> from inve&s;tigating the whole affair, and proving my innocence; the world believes the young lady in que&s;tion to have been as pure as an angel; but their opin|ions are mo&s;t egregiou&s;ly erroneous&mdash;How|ever, I &s;hall wait until your return, before I make up my mind upon this cur&s;ed bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
