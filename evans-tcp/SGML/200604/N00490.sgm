God forbid, that <HI>we</HI> should any of us have any Indisposition to such <HI>Meditations</HI> on the <HI>Day of Judgment,</HI> as are Laid before us, in the Books of some that are Longing for the Day.

<HEAD>AN APPENDIX Containing only some Heads of Meditation, on the <HI>DAY OF JUDGMENT,</HI> more largely and fully delivered in a Sermon Preach|ed at <HI>Charlestown.</HI></HEAD>
<HEAD>By the Reverend <HI>SAMUEL LEE.</HI></HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>On Math. 25. 6.</BIBL>
<Q><HI>At Midnight there was a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"></HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE <HI>Scope</HI> of a Parable <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> best Expositor of it. The Design of this is to Express, The <HI>Suddenness</HI> of our Lords Advent, and the <HI>Supidity</HI> and <HI>Security</HI> of the World with reference thereto.</P>
<P>Oberve, Blessed Christians, Three Things,</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="000614_0083_0FA9AB7683EB6B00">
FIRST. A dolorous Exclamation, with the dismal season of it.</P>
<P>The out cry here, is like that of drowning Marriners, or routed Souldi|ers.</P>
<P>SECONDLY. The matter of the Exclamation thus amazing, which causes all the great Hectors, and Herods, and <HI>Belshazzars</HI> of the World, to tremble.</P>
<P>Yet it is not, <HI>Behold, the Judge Cometh!</HI>&mdash;but,&mdash;the Bride|groom, the Delight of our Souls.</P>
<P>Tis good Advice, Are you Ready! <HI>Dr. Usher</HI> used to say unto some Persons of Quality. <HI>Madam, Be ready, Be ready.</HI></P>
<P>THIRDLY. A Command unto all, Especially the Virgins, <HI>Go out to meet Aim.</HI> Even Hypocrites count them|selves in a fair way to meet the Lord.</P>
<P>Of old, Marriage was at <HI>Midnight,</HI> to show the <HI>Modesty</HI> of Marriage. You are by Ministers now <HI>Contracted,</HI> and are to be by Angels at last <HI>Conduct|ed</HI> unto Jesus Christ.</P>
<P>The Ten <HI>Virgins</HI> are professors of
<PB N="51" REF="000614_0084_0FA9AB7732ECAAB8">
Sorts. A <HI>Wise</HI> Virgin is a Soul that takes the seasons of Grace, and is af|fected with the Beauty of Jesus Christ. A <HI>Foolish,</HI> is one, that regards not the Word of God. <HI>Midnight,</HI> is the End of the World, before the Morning of the <HI>Resurrection.</HI> The Cry is an <HI>Angelical Voice:</HI> as soon as the Clock strikes Twelve, then the Angel sets his <HI>Trumpet</HI> to his mouth, and proclameth so.</P>
<P>The <HI>Apantesis,</HI>&mdash;the Meeting here Expressed, is the <HI>Resurrection.</HI> when the Earth and Sea too shall yield their <HI>Dead;</HI> and the very Entrails of the Fishes shall be raked by the Trident of the <HI>Archangel.</HI> Never was there such a Terror as then will be! But the Saints are then led unto the <HI>Nuptial</HI> in the New Jerusalem.</P>

<P>At the Coming of Jesus Christ to Judgment, the whole World shall be in a state of great Security, and Insensibility of His Coming.</P>

<HI>I.</HI> There shall be a Great <HI>Day of Judgment.</HI> How many Warnings have you had about this Day of the Lord? But alas, How many of the then Raised, shall say, <HI>Non Putaram;</HI> or, <HI>This I thought not of!</HI> which is a sign of a great <HI>Fool.</HI></P>
<P>Oh that we could be like <HI>Jerom:</HI> alwayes having a, <HI>Come to Judgment,</HI> in our Ears! <HI>I</HI> beleive you all make a <HI>Day of Judgment,</HI> an Article of your Creed. Why, The Heathen had a sense of it.</P>
<P N="II"><HI>II. Near</HI> and <HI>At</HI> that very time, there shall be a deadly Stupefaction in the World. As to sit under <HI>Night|shade,</HI> breeds a Stupor.&mdash;This will be the Effect of being in the <HI>Night shade Walks</HI> of the World.</P>
<P>How are most of us asleep? so that one can hardly get so much as any good Discourse on foot among us. See Math. 24. 39. <HI>And knew not till the Flood came and took them all away; so shall also the Coming of the Son of man be.</HI>&mdash;Remember that on your Knees&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="000614_0086_0FA9AB79F9D5B5B8">
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> This comes from want of Con|sideration God says, <HI>O that they would Consider!</HI> See Psal. 119. 59.

Tis only Gods Fire and Vinegar, that can cause the Nether Milstone of our Hearts to Crack. And it works in <HI>Consideration. Consideration</HI> is the Glory of a man; and it would be our Happiness.

<P>This comes,</P>

<P N="2">2. From a Judicial <HI>Obsignation.</HI></P>
<P>God says, to His Ministers, Go Preach at such a place, and harden the People there.</P>
<P>Oh with uplifted Hands beg, <HI>Lord, let me not be Sealed up under this hard|ness.</HI>This Hardness will be turned into shrieks in Hell. See Exod. 9.10. From this Hardness tis, that men will <HI>Scoff</HI> at a Little Expression of a Mi|nister,&mdash;but every such Scoff shall cost you a Thousand years in Hell. This <HI>Nigrum Theta,</HI> marks for Hell.</P>
<P N="3">3. From a Confaederation with <HI>Sin,</HI> and with <HI>Sinners.</HI> Tis not our <HI>Can|not,</HI> but our <HI>Will not,</HI> that undo's us. Famous <HI>Fenner</HI> ha's Writ well of this <HI>Self-Murder.</HI> Sinners, as <HI>Cliopatra,</HI> take the Asp of <HI>Incomsiderateness,</HI> and put it to their Breasts.</P>
