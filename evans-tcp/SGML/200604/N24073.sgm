<SALUTE>DEAR SUSAN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HOWEVER fond of novels and roman|ces you may be, the unfortunate adventures of one of my neighbours, who died ye&s;ter|day, will make you de&s;pi&s;e that fiction, in which, knowing the &s;ubject to be fabulous, we can never be &s;o truly intere&s;ted. While this lady was expiring, Mrs. C&mdash; V&mdash;, her near kin&s;woman, related to me her un|happy hi&s;tory, in which I &s;hall now take the liberty of intere&s;ting your benevolent and feeling heart.</P>
<P>MARIA KITTLE was the only i&s;&s;ue of her parents, who cultivated a large farm on the
<PB N="4" REF="031837_0003_0FEECD84BAF53F18">
banks of the <HI>Hud&s;on,</HI> eighteen miles above <HI>Albany.</HI> They were per&s;ons of good natu|ral abilities, improved by &s;ome learning; yet, con&s;cious of a deficiency in their edu|cation, they &s;tudied nothing &s;o much as to render their little daughter truly accom|pli&s;hed.</P>
<P>MARIA was born in the year 1721. Her promi&s;ing infancy pre&s;aged a maturity of excellencies; every amiable quality dawn|ed through her li&s;ping prattle; every per|&s;onal grace attended her attitudes and play|ed over her features. As &s;he advanced through the playful &s;tage of childhood, &s;he became more eminent than a Penelope for her indu&s;try; yet, &s;oon as the &s;un declin|ed, &s;he always retired with her books until the time of repo&s;e, by which means &s;he &s;oon informed her opening mind with the principles of every u&s;eful &s;cience. She was beloved by all her female companions, who, though they ea&s;ily di&s;covered her opening elegance of manners, in&s;tead of envying, were excited to imitate her. As &s;he al|ways made one in their little parties of plea|&s;ure on fe&s;tival days, it is no wonder that &s;he &s;oon became the reigning godde&s;s a|mong the &s;wains. She was importuned to
<PB REF="031837_0004_0FEE92FD40087BE0">
admit the addre&s;&s;es of numbers, whom &s;he politely di&s;carded, and withdrew her&s;elf a|while from public ob&s;ervation. However, the fame of her charms attracted &s;everal gentlemen of family from <HI>Albany,</HI> who in|truded on her retirement, &s;oliciting her hand. But this happine&s;s was re&s;erved for a near relation of her's, one Mr. KITTLE, who&s;e merits had made an impre&s;&s;ion on her heart. He, although not hand&s;ome, was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a mo&s;t engaging addre&s;s; while his learning and moral virtues more particularly recommended him to her e&s;|teem. Their parents &s;oon di&s;covered their reciprocal pa&s;&s;ion, and highly approving of it, ha&s;tened their marriage, which was cele|brated under the mo&s;t happy au&s;pices.</P>
<P>MARIA was fifteen when married. They removed to his farm, on which he had built a &s;mall neat hou&s;e, &s;urrounded by tall ce|dars, which gave it a contemplative air. It was &s;ituated on an eminence, with a green inclo&s;ure in the front, graced by a well cultivated garden on one &s;ide, and on the other by a clear &s;tream, which, ru&s;hing over a bed of white pebble, gave them a high poli&s;h, that ca&s;t a &s;oft gleam through the water.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="031837_0005_0FEECD9B02165CE0">Here they re&s;ided in the tranquil enjoy|ment of that happine&s;s which &s;o much me|rit and innocence de&s;erved: the indigent, the &s;orrowful, the unfortunate were always &s;ure of con&s;olation when they entered tho&s;e peaceful doors. They were almo&s;t adored by their neighbours, and even the wild &s;a|vages them&s;elves, who often re&s;orted thith|er for refre&s;hments when hunting, expre&s;&s;|ed the greate&s;t regard for them, and admi|ration of their virtues.</P>
<P>In little more than a year they were ble&s;|&s;ed with a daughter, the lovelier re&s;emblance of her lovely mother: as &s;he grew up, her graces increa&s;ing, promi&s;ed a bloom and under&s;tanding equal to her's; the Indians, in particular, were extremely fond of the &s;miling ANNA; whenever they found a young fawn, or caught a brood of wood-ducks, or &s;urpri&s;ed the young beaver in their daily excur&s;ions through the fore&s;ts, they pre&s;ented them with plea&s;ure to her; they brought her the earlie&s;t &s;trawberries, the &s;carlet plumb, and other delicate wild fruits in painted ba&s;kets.</P>
<P>How did the fond parents' hearts delight to &s;ee their beloved one &s;o univer&s;ally ca|re&s;&s;ed! When they &s;auntered over the ver|nal
<PB N="7" REF="031837_0006_0FEE9358601BDD28">
fields with the little prattler wantoning before them collecting flowers and pur&s;uing the velvet elu&s;ive butterfly, MARIA's cheek &s;uffu&s;ing with rapture, "Oh my dear," &s;he would &s;ay,
<Q>we are happier than human beings can expect to be; how trivial are the evils annexed to our &s;ituation! may God avert that our heaven be limited to this life!</Q></P>
<P>Eleven years now elap&s;ed before Mrs. KITTLE di&s;covered any &s;igns of pregnan|cy: her &s;pou&s;e &s;ilently wi&s;hed for a &s;on, and his de&s;ires were at length gratified; &s;he was delivered of a charming boy, who was named, after him, WILLIAM.</P>
<P>A French and Indian war had commen|ced &s;ometime before; but about eight months after her delivery, the &s;avages be|gan to commit the mo&s;t horrid depreda|tions on the Engli&s;h frontiers. Mr. KIT|TLE, alarmed at the danger of his brothers, who dwelt near <HI>Fort-Edward,</HI> (the elde&s;t be|ing ju&s;t married to a very agreeable young woman) invited them to re&s;ide with him during the war.</P>
<P>They were &s;carce arrived when the enemy made further incur&s;ions into the country, burning the villages and &s;calping the inhab|itants,
<PB N="8" REF="031837_0007_0FEECD8050516228">
neither re&s;pecting age nor &s;ex. This terribly alarmed Mrs. KITTLE; &s;he began to prepare for flight, and the next evening after receiving this intelligence, as &s;he and Mr. KITTLE were bu&s;ily employed in pack|ing up china and other things, they were acco&s;ted by &s;everal Indians, who&s;e wigwams were contiguous to the village of <HI>Schochti|cook,</HI> and who always &s;eemed well affected to the Engli&s;h. An elderly &s;avage under|took to be prolocutor, and de&s;ired the fa|mily to compo&s;e them&s;elves, a&s;&s;uring them they &s;hould be cautioned again&s;t any ap|proaching danger. To inforce his argu|ment, he pre&s;ented MARIA with a belt interwoven with &s;ilk and beads, &s;aying,
<Q>There, receive my token of friend&s;hip: we go to dig up the hatchet, to &s;ink it in the heads of your enemies; we &s;hall guard this wood with a wall of fire&mdash; you &s;hall be &s;afe.</Q>
A warm glow of hope deepened in MARIA's cheek at this&mdash; Then ordering wine to be brought to the friendly &s;avages, with a &s;mile of diffidence, "I am afraid," &s;aid &s;he,
<Q>nece&s;&s;ity may o|blige you to abandon us, or neglect of your promi&s;e may deprive us of your protection.</Q>
&mdash;"Neglect of my promi&s;e!"
<PB N="9" REF="031837_0008_0FEECD9E0AAAD5C0">
retorted he with &s;ome acrimony:
<Q>No, MARIA, I am a true man; I &s;hoot the arrow up to the Great Captain every new moon: depend upon it, I will trample down the briars round your dwelling, that you do not hurt your feet.</Q>
MARIA now retired, bowing a grateful acknowl|edgment, and leaving the &s;avages to indulge their fe&s;tivity, who pa&s;&s;ed the night in the mo&s;t vociferous mirth.</P>
<P>Mrs. KITTLE, with a &s;ort of exultation, related the &s;ubject of their conference to her hu&s;band, who had ab&s;ented him&s;elf on their fir&s;t appearance, having formed &s;ome &s;u&s;picion of the &s;incerity of their friend&s;hip, and not being willing to be duped by their di&s;&s;imulation. "And now," added MARIA &s;miling,
<Q>our fears may again &s;ub&s;ide: Oh my dear! my happine&s;s is trebled into rapture, by &s;eeing you and my &s;weet babes out of danger.</Q>
He only &s;ighed, and reaching his arm round her poli&s;hed neck, pre&s;&s;ed her to his bo&s;om. After a &s;hort pau&s;e, "My love," &s;aid he,
<Q>be not too confident of their fidelity; you &s;urely know what a &s;mall dependence is to be placed on their promi&s;es: however, to appear &s;u&s;picious might be &s;uddenly fatal to us; we will
<PB N="10" REF="031837_0009_0FEECD729D5E99B8">
therefore &s;u&s;pend our journey to <HI>Albany</HI> for a few days.</Q>
Though MARIA's &s;oul &s;addened at the conviction of this truth; though her fears urged her to propo&s;e im|mediate flight, yet &s;he acquie&s;ced; and ha|ving &s;upped with the family, this tender pair &s;unk a&s;leep on the bo&s;om of re&s;t.</P>
<P>Early the next morning Mr. KITTLE a|ro&s;e, fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ing a ki&s;s on MARIA's &s;oft cheek, as &s;he &s;lumbered with her infant in her arms. He then awaked his brother, reminding him that he had propo&s;ed a hunting match the preceding evening. "It is true," replied PETER,
<Q>but &s;ince ho&s;|tilities have commenced &s;o near us as the Indians inform, I think it rather impru|dent to quit the family.</Q>
&mdash;
<Q>Come, come,</Q>
replied the other,
<Q>do not let us intimidate the neighbours by cloi&s;ter|tering our&s;elves up with women and chil|dren.</Q>&mdash;
"I reject the thought," rejoin|ed PETER, "of being afraid." Then hav|ing dre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf, while his brother charg|ed their pieces, they left the hou&s;e, and traver&s;ed the pathle&s;s gra&s;s for many hours without perceiving any thing but &s;mall birds, who filled the fragrant air with melody. "PETER," &s;aid Mr. KITTLE, ca&s;ting his
<PB N="11" REF="031837_0010_0FEECD6C9FB8B658">
eyes around the lovely land&s;cape,
<Q>what a profu&s;ion of &s;weets does Nature exhale to plea&s;e her intelligent creatures! I feel my heart expand with love and gratitude to heaven every moment, nor can I ever be grateful enough. I have health and competence, a lovely fond wife who&s;e &s;mile would calm the rude&s;t &s;torm of pa&s;|&s;ion, and two infants blo&s;&s;oming into per|fection; all my &s;ocial ties are yet unbro|ken&mdash;PETER, I anticipate my heaven&mdash; But why, my brother do you turn pale? what dreadful idea &s;tiffens your features with amazement? what in God's name ails you, PETER? are you unwel? &s;it down under this tree awhile.</Q>
&mdash;To the&s;e interrogaties PETER replied,
<Q>Excu&s;e my weakne&s;s, I am not unwel, but an unu|&s;ual horror chilled my blood; I felt as if the damps of death pre&s;t already round my &s;oul; but the vapour is gone off a|gain, I feel quite better.</Q>
Mr. KITTLE cheered his brother, attributing his emotion to fear; who, by this time, having re-a&s;&s;u|med his compo&s;ure, entered into di&s;cour&s;e with cheerfulne&s;s, refu&s;ing to return home without having killed any thing.</P>
<P>Then ri&s;ing, they proceeded through lof|ty
<PB N="12" REF="031837_0011_0FEECDCA3517CC00">
groves of pine, and open fields that &s;eem|ed to bend under the heavy hand of Ceres. At la&s;t, di&s;appointment and fatigue prevail|ed on them to return home: they had gone farther than they apprehended; but pa&s;&s;ing along the bank of the river within a few miles of Mr. Kittle's, they e&s;pied a fat doe walking &s;ecurely on the beach, which Peter &s;oftly approaching, levelled his piece with &s;o good an aim that the animal dropped in|&s;tantly at the explo&s;ion. This &s;eeming &s;uc|ce&s;s was, however the origin of their cala|mities; for immediately after, two &s;avages appeared, directed in their cour&s;e by the firing. Setting up a loud yell, they ran up to the brothers and di&s;charged their fire|arms. Mr. Kittle &s;tarted back, but Peter received a brace of balls in his bo&s;om. He recoiled a few &s;teps back, and then &s;unk down encompa&s;&s;ed with tho&s;e deadly hor|rors of which in the morning he had a pre|&s;entiment. Mr. Kittle &s;tood awhile agha&s;t, like a per&s;on ju&s;t waked from a frightful dream; but on &s;eeing the Indian advancing to tear the &s;calp from his dying brother, he &s;uddenly recollected him&s;elf, and &s;hot a bul|let through his head: then grappling with the other, who was loading again, he wre&s;t|ed
<PB N="13" REF="031837_0012_0FEECD4D9D4EE248">
his firelock from him, and felled him to the ground with the but-end of it. This was no time for reflection or unavailing la|ments; the danger was eminent: &s;o leav|ing the &s;avages for dead, with a mournful &s;ilence Mr. Kittle ha&s;tened to throw the deer from off his hor&s;e, and laid his bleed|ing brother acro&s;s him.</P>
<P>When our &s;ouls are gloomy, they &s;eem to ca&s;t a &s;hade over the objects that &s;urround us, and make nature corre&s;pondent to our feelings: &s;o Mr. Kittle thought the night fell with a deeper gloom than u&s;ual. The &s;oft notes of evening birds &s;eemed to be the re&s;pon&s;es of &s;avage yells. The echo of his tread, which he never before regarded, now rung di&s;mally hollow in his ears. Even the ru&s;tling of the winds through the leaves &s;eemed attended with a &s;olemnity that chil|led him with cold tremors. As he pro|ceeded with his mournful charge, his feel|ings were alarmed for his dear Maria; he dreaded the agitation and di&s;tre&s;s this ad|venture would throw her in: but it was unavoidable!</P>
<P>The &s;ound of his hor&s;e's feet no &s;ooner invaded the ears of Maria, than &s;eizing a light, &s;he &s;prung with a joyful impatience
<PB N="14" REF="031837_0013_0FEECE12136C7538">
to the door, and was met by her partner pale and bloody, who endeavoured to pre|vent too &s;udden a di&s;covery of this calami|ty. But at the fir&s;t glance &s;he comprehen|ded the whole affair, and retiring a few &s;teps, with the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite agony in her countenance, "Oh Mr. Kittle!" &s;he cried, cla&s;ping her hands together, "it is all over &mdash;we are betrayed&mdash;your brother is kill|ed!"&mdash;"Too true, oh, too fatally true!" replied he, falling on his knees be&s;ide her as &s;he &s;unk down, "my angel! the very &s;avages that &s;olemly engaged to protect us have deprived him of life; but I am yet alive, my Maria, be comforted&mdash;I will in|&s;tantly procure carriages, and before morn|ing you and your innocents &s;hall be beyond the reach of their malevolence."</P>
<P>By this time the family had crouded a|bout them, and with grievous wailings were inquiring the particulars of this &s;ad adven|ture. Mr. Kittle having related every cir|cum&s;tance with brevity, ordered the corp&s;e to be laid in a remote chamber, de&s;iring at the &s;ame time a hor&s;e to be &s;addled for him. Then, more oppre&s;&s;ed by his wife's griefs than his own, he led the di&s;con&s;olate fair to her chamber, where, being &s;eated, &s;he &s;igh|ing
<PB N="15" REF="031837_0014_0FEECD5F43C721F0">
demanded where he intended to go at that time of night. "Only," &s;aid he, "to the village of <HI>Schochticook</HI> to hire a couple of waggons; I &s;hall return in an hour I hope, with a proper guard to &s;ecure our re|treat from this ho&s;tile place." Maria was &s;ilent; at length &s;he bur&s;t into a flood of tears, which his endearments only augment|ed. Then expo&s;tulating with him, "Is it not enough," cried &s;he, "that you have e&s;caped one danger, but mu&s;t you be &s;o ve|ry eager to encounter others? be&s;ides, you are &s;pent with &s;orrow and fatigue&mdash;let one of your brothers perform this &s;ilent expedi|tion.&mdash;"It is impo&s;&s;ible," replied the ten|der hu&s;band; "how can I dare to propo&s;e a danger to them from which I would &s;hrink my&s;elf? their lives are equally precious with mine: but God may di&s;appoint our fears, my love!" He would have continued, but his &s;pou&s;e, ri&s;ing from her &s;eat, interrupted him&mdash;"At lea&s;t, my dear, before you leave us give your lovely babes a farewel em|brace, that if fate &s;hould&mdash;&s;hould &s;eparate us, <HI>that</HI> yet &s;hall &s;weeten our hours of ab|&s;ence." Here &s;he found her&s;elf cla&s;ped in her con&s;ort's arms, who exclaimed, "My Maria! I love you pa&s;&s;ionately, and if the
<PB N="16" REF="031837_0015_0FEECD9C86031FA0">
lea&s;t &s;hadow of danger did appear to attend this night's travel, for your &s;ake, for my ble&s;&s;ed children's &s;ake I would decline it: but I have left the Indians lifele&s;s, who no doubt attacked us from &s;ome private pique; nor will they be di&s;covered until morning." &mdash;"Well then," Maria an&s;wered, "I no longer oppo&s;e you; forgive my fears."&mdash; Meanwhile as &s;he &s;tept to the cradle for her &s;uckling, the fair Anna, who was li&s;tening at the door anxious to hear her parents &s;en|timents on this occa&s;ion, quitted her &s;tation and flew to them &s;wift as light; dropping on her knees before her father, and look|ed up in his face with the mo&s;t attractive graces and the per&s;ua&s;ive eloquence of &s;im|plicity. Her neck and features were ele|gantly turned, her complexion fairer than the tubero&s;e, and contra&s;ted by the mo&s;t &s;hining ringlets of dark hair. Her eyes, who&s;e brilliancy was &s;oftened through the medium of tears, for a while dwelt tender|ly on his countenance. At length, with a voice &s;carce audible, &s;he &s;ighed out, "Oh papa! do not leave us; if any accident &s;hould happen to you, mamma will die of grief, and what will become of poor Anna and Billy? who will care for me? who will
<PB N="17" REF="031837_0016_0FEECD8DC204DC68">
teach me when my papa, my mamma's papa is gone?"&mdash;"My &s;weet child," replied he, embracing her and holding her to his bo|&s;om, "there is no danger; I &s;hall return in an hour, and before to-morrow you &s;hall be &s;afe on the plains of <HI>Albany,</HI> and my heart &s;hall exult over the happine&s;s of my family."</P>
<P>Mrs. Kittle now approached with her playful infant in her arms; but its winning actions extorted nothing but groans from her pained bo&s;om, which was more &s;tormy than Ontario-Lake, when agitated by fierce winds. Mr. Kittle perceiving this uncom|mon emotion, gently took the child from her, and repeatedly ki&s;&s;ed it, while new &s;miles dimpled its lovely a&s;pect. "Oh!" &s;aid he to him&s;elf, "this gloom that dark|ens Maria's &s;oul is &s;upernatural!&mdash;it &s;eems dreadfully portentious!&mdash;Shall I yet &s;tay?" But here a &s;ervant informing him that his hor&s;e was ready, he blu&s;hed at his want of fortitude; and having conquered his irre&s;|olution, after the mo&s;t affecting and &s;olemn parting, he quitted his hou&s;e, never to re|view it more!</P>
<P>Maria then walked &s;adly back again, and having a&s;&s;embly the family in a little hall,
<PB N="18" REF="031837_0017_0FEECDA6D1ED3FA8">
they clo&s;ed and barred the doors&punc; Mrs. Comelia Kittle, Maria's &s;i&s;ter-in-law, was far advanced in her pregnancy, which in|crea&s;ed her hu&s;band's unea&s;ine&s;s for her; and they were debating in what manner to accommodate her at <HI>Albany,</HI> when the tram|pling of feet about the hou&s;e, and a yell of complicated voices, announced the Indians arrival. Struck with horror and con&s;tern|ation, the little family crouded together in the center of the hall, while the &s;ervants at this alarm, being in a kitchen di&s;tant from the hou&s;e, &s;aved them&s;elves by a precipitate flight. The little Billy, frightened at &s;uch dreadful &s;ounds, clung fa&s;t to his mother's throbbing brea&s;t, while Anna, in a &s;ilent agony of amazement, cla&s;ped her trembling knees. The echo of their yells yet rung in long vibrations through the fore&s;t, when, with a thundering peal of &s;trokes at the door, they demanded entrance. Di&s;trac|tion and de&s;pair &s;at upon every face. Ma|ria and her companions gazed wildly at each other, till, upon repeated menaces and ef|forts to break open the door, Comelia's hu&s;band, giving all for lo&s;t, lei&s;urely advan|ced to the door. Comelia &s;eeing this, ut|tered a great &s;hriek, and cried out, "O
<PB N="19" REF="031837_0018_0FEECD6F9D98F720">
God! what are you doing, my ra&s;h, ra&s;h, unfortunate hu&s;band! you will be &s;acrific|ed!" Then falling on her knees, &s;he caught hold of his hand and &s;obbed out, "O pi|ty me! have mercy on your&s;elf, on me, on my child!"&mdash;"Alas! my love," &s;aid he, half turning with a look of di&s;traction, "what can we do? let us be re&s;igned to the will of God." So &s;aying he unbarred the door, and that in&s;tant received a fatal bullet in his bo&s;om, and fell backward wri|thing in the agonies of death; the re&s;t re|coiled at this horrible &s;pectacle, and hud|dled in a corner, &s;ending forth the mo&s;t piercing cries: in the interim the &s;avages ru&s;hing in with great &s;houts, proceeded to mangle the corp&s;e, and having made an in|ci&s;ion round his head with a crooked knife, they tugged off his bloody &s;calp with bar|barous triumph. While this was perpetra|ting, an Indian, hideou&s;ly painted, &s;trode ferociou&s;ly up to Comelia, (who &s;unk away at the &s;ight, and fainted on a chair) and cleft her white forehead deeply with his tomahack. Her fine azure eyes ju&s;t open|ed, and then &s;uddenly clo&s;ing for ever, &s;he tumbled lifele&s;s at his feet. His &s;anguina|ry &s;oul was not yet &s;atisfied with blood; he
<PB N="20" REF="031837_0019_0FEECDE9A8D60E48">
deformed her lovely body with deep ga&s;h|es; and, tearing her unborn babe away, da&s;hed it to pieces again&s;t the &s;tone wall; with many additional circum&s;tances of in|fernal cruelty.</P>
<P>During this horrid carnage, the dead were &s;tripped, and dragged from the hou&s;e, when one of the helli&s;h band advanced to Maria, who circling her babes with her white arms, was &s;ending hopele&s;s petitions to heaven, and bemoaning their cruelly lo&s;t &s;ituation: as he approached, expecting the fatal &s;troke, &s;he endeavoured to guard her children, and with &s;upplicating looks, implored for mer|cy. The &s;avage attempted not to &s;trike; but the a&s;toni&s;hed Anna &s;heltered her&s;elf behind her mamma, while her blooming &s;uckling quitting her brea&s;t, gazed with a plea&s;ing wonder on the painted &s;tranger.&mdash; Maria &s;oon recognized her old friend that pre&s;ented her with the belt, through the loads of &s;hells and feathers that di&s;gui&s;ed him. This was no time, however, to irri|tate him, by reminding him of his promi&s;e; yet, gue&s;&s;ing her thoughts, he anticipated her remon&s;trance. "Maria," &s;aid he, "be not afraid, I have promi&s;ed to protect you; you &s;hall live and dance with us around the
<PB N="21" REF="031837_0020_0FEECDA54D30F400">
fire at <HI>Canada:</HI> but you have one &s;mall incumbrance, which, if not removed, will much impede your progre&s;s thither." So &s;aying he &s;eized her laughing babe by the wri&s;ts, and forcibly endeavoured to draw him from her arms. At this, terrified be|yond conception, &s;he exclaimed, "O God! leave me, leave me my child! he &s;hall not go, though a legion of devils &s;hould try to &s;eparate us!" Holding him &s;till fa&s;t, while the Indian applied his &s;trength to tear him away, kna&s;hing his teeth at her oppo&s;ition; "Help! God of heaven!" &s;creamed &s;he, "help! have pity, have mercy on this in|fant! O God! O Chri&s;t! can you bear to &s;ee this? O mercy! mercy! mercy! let a little &s;park of compa&s;&s;ion &s;ave this inoffend|ing, this lovely angel!" By this time the breathle&s;s babe dropt its head on its bo&s;om; the wri&s;ts were nigh pinched off, and &s;ee|ing him ju&s;t expiring, with a dreadful &s;hriek &s;he re&s;igned him to the mercile&s;s hands of the &s;avage, who in&s;tantly da&s;hed his little forehead again&s;t the &s;tones, and ca&s;ting his bleeding body at &s;ome di&s;tance from the hou&s;e, left him to make his exit in feeble and unheard groans.&mdash;Then indeed, in the unutterable angui&s;h of her &s;oul, &s;he fell pro|&s;trate,
<PB N="22" REF="031837_0021_0FEECD681CF37FC0">
and rending away her hair, &s;he roar|ed out her &s;orrows with a voice louder than natural, and rendered awfully hollow by too great an exertion. "O barbarians!" &s;he exclaimed, "&s;urpa&s;&s;ing devils in wick|edne&s;s! &s;o may a tenfold night of mi&s;ery enwrap your black &s;ouls as you have de|prived the babe of my bo&s;om, the comfort of my cares, my ble&s;&s;ed cherub, of light and life&mdash;O hell! are not thy flames impa|tient to cleave the center and engulph the&s;e wretches in thy ever burning waves? are there no thunders in Heaven&mdash;no avenging Angel&mdash;no God to take notice of &s;uch Hea|ven defying cruelties?" Then ru&s;hing to her dead infant with redoubled cries, and clapping her hands, &s;he laid her&s;elf over his mangled body; again &s;oftened into tears and moans, &s;he wiped the blood from his gha&s;tly countenance, and pre&s;t him to her heaving bo&s;om, alternately care&s;&s;ing him and her trembling Anna, who, clinging to her with bitter wailings, and ki&s;&s;ing her hands and face, entreated her to implore the &s;av|ages for mercy. "Do, my angel mamma," &s;he urged, "do beg them yet to pity&mdash;beg them yet to &s;ave you for my poor, poor pa|pa's &s;ake!&mdash;Alas! if we are all killed, his

heart will break!&mdash;Oh! they can't be rocks and &s;tones!&mdash;Don't cry mamma, they will &s;pare us!"&mdash;Thus the little orator endea|voured to con&s;ole her afflicted mother; but their melancholy endearments were &s;oon in|terrupted by the relentle&s;s &s;avages, who hav|ing plundered the hou&s;e of every valuable thing that was portable, returned to Maria, and rudely catching her arm, commanded her to follow them; but repul&s;ing them with the boldne&s;s of de&s;pair, "Leave me, leave me," &s;he &s;aid, "I cannot go&mdash;I ne|ver will quit my murdered child! Too cru|el in your mercies, you have given me life only to prolong my mi&s;eries!"&mdash;Meanwhile the lovely Anna, terrified at the ho&s;tile ap|pearance of the enemy, left her mamma &s;truggling to di&s;engage her&s;elf from the In|dians, and fled precipitately to the hou&s;e. She had already concealed her&s;elf in a clo|&s;et, when Mrs. Kittle pur&s;uing her, was in|tercepted by flames, the &s;avages having fi|red the hou&s;e. The wretched child &s;oon di&s;covered her deplorable &s;ituation, and al|mo&s;t &s;uffocated by the &s;moke, with piercing cries called for help to her dear, dear mo|ther.&mdash;Alas! what could the unhappy pa|rent do? whole &s;heets of flames rolled be|tween

them, while in a phrenzy of grief, &s;he &s;creamed out, "O my la&s;t trea&s;ure, my be|loved Anna! try to e&s;cape the devouring fire&mdash;come to me, my &s;weet child&mdash;the In|dians will not kill us&mdash;O my peri&s;hing babe! have pity on your mother&mdash;do not leave me quite de&s;titute!" Then turning to the calm villains who attended her, &s;he cried, "Why do you not attempt to re&s;cue my &s;weet innocent? Can your unfeeling hearts not bear to leave me one&mdash;a &s;olitary &s;ingle one?" Again calling to her Anna, &s;he received no an&s;wer, which being a pre|&s;umption of her death, the Indians obliged Maria and her brother Henry to quit the hou&s;e, which they effected with &s;ome diffi|culty, the glowing beams falling around them and thick volumes of &s;moke ob&s;curing their pa&s;&s;age. The flames now &s;truck a long &s;plendor through the humid atmo&s;phere, and blu&s;hed to open the tragical &s;cene on the face of heaven. They had &s;carce advanced two hundred yards with their reluctant cap|tives, when the flaming &s;tructure tumbled to the earth with a dreadful cra&s;h. Our trav|ellers by in&s;tinct turned their eyes to the mournful blaze; and Maria, bur&s;ting afre&s;h into grievous lamentations, cried, "There,
<PB N="25" REF="031837_0024_0FEECD7589C678D0">
there my brother, my children are wrapt in arching &s;heets of flames, that u&s;ed to be cir|cled in my arms! they are entombed in ru|ins that breathed their &s;lumbers on my bo|&s;om! yet, oh! their &s;potle&s;s &s;ouls even now ri&s;e from this chaos of blood and fire, and are pleading our injured cau&s;e before our God, my brother!" He only replied in &s;ighs and groans; he &s;carcely heard her; horror had froze up the avenues of his &s;oul; and all amazed and trembling, he followed his leaders like a per&s;on in a trouble&s;ome dream.</P>
<P>The di&s;tant flames now ca&s;t a fainter light, and the northern breeze bent the columns of &s;moke over the &s;outh horizon. Sad and benighted, they wandered through almo&s;t impenetrable &s;wamps, forded the broad &s;tream of <HI>Tomhanick,</HI> and the rapid river of <HI>Ho&s;ack;</HI> they pa&s;&s;ed through de&s;erted &s;et|tlements, where the yelling of &s;olitary dogs increa&s;ed the &s;olemnity of midnight, nor halted till the &s;tars, emitting a feebler lu&s;tre, pre&s;aged the approach of day. Maria, over|come by &s;orrow and fatigue, immediately &s;unk helple&s;s at the foot of a tree, while the &s;avages (who were &s;ix in number) kindled a fire, and prepared their meal, (in a cala|ba&s;h)

which con&s;i&s;ted only of &s;ome parched maize pulverized and enriched with the fat of bears fle&s;h. Ob&s;erving Maria had fallen a&s;leep, they offered not to di&s;turb her, but invited Henry Kittle to partake of their re|pa&s;t. He dur&s;t not refu&s;e them; and hav|ing &s;wallowed a few mouthfuls of their un|palatable food, and accepted of a pipe of to|bacco, he de&s;ired leave to repo&s;e him&s;elf, which being readily granted, they &s;oon fol|lowed his example, and &s;unk a&s;leep, leaving two centinels to guard again&s;t &s;urpri&s;e, which precaution they always make u&s;e of.</P>
<P>I am, &s;orry, dear Su&s;an, to quit Maria in this intere&s;ting part of her &s;tory; but order requires that we &s;hould now return to her &s;pou&s;e, whom we left on his way through the wood.</P>
<P>The village of <HI>Schochticook</HI> is &s;ituated on a circular plain, &s;urrounded by high hills, ri&s;ing in form of an amphitheatre. Mr. Kit|tle had ju&s;t gained the verge, when, chanc|ing to ca&s;t his eyes around, he perceived the whole &s;outhern hemi&s;phere &s;uddenly illumi|nated with a bright blaze; however, being accu&s;tomed to the fore&s;t's being often fired to clear it from the underwood, he was not much &s;urpri&s;ed, but proceeded to de&s;cend
<PB N="27" REF="031837_0026_0FEECD7892CBEF78">
the hill. On his arriving with the account of his brother's murder, the place was put in the highe&s;t commotion; the men fitting up their arms, and the women clamouring about them, highly importunate to be removed to <HI>Albany;</HI> but the night being very dark, this manoeuvre was deferred till morning; nor could Mr. Kittle prevail on a &s;ingle per&s;on to return with him during the darkne&s;s; he felt him&s;elf &s;trangely agitated at this di&s;ap|pointment, and, refu&s;ing to repo&s;e him&s;elf, with great impatience he watched the fir&s;t orient beam of Pho&s;phor, which appearing, he &s;at off for home with two waggons, and a guard of three Indians. As he approach|ed his late happy dwelling, his bo&s;om dila|ted with the plea&s;ing hope of &s;oon extrica|ting his beloved family from danger; he chid the &s;lowne&s;s of the carriages, and felt impatient to di&s;&s;ipate the apprehen&s;ions of Maria, to ki&s;s the pendant tear from her eye, and pre&s;s his &s;portive innocents to his bo&s;om. While the&s;e bright ideas play|ed round his &s;oul, he lifted up his eyes, and through an opening of the woods, beheld his farm: but what language can expre&s;s his &s;urpri&s;e and con&s;ternation at &s;eeing his habitation &s;o &s;uddenly de&s;olated! a loud ex|clamation
<PB N="28" REF="031837_0027_0FEECD5994D82A98">
of amaze bur&s;t from the whole company at &s;o unexpected a view&mdash;the blood revolted from Mr. Kittle's cheek&mdash;his heart throbbed under the big emotion, and all agha&s;t, &s;purring on his hor&s;e, he entered the inclo&s;ure with full &s;peed.&mdash;Stop here un|happy man! here let the fibres of thy heart crack with excruciating mi&s;ery&mdash;let the cruel view of mangled wretches, &s;o nearly allied to thee, extort drops of blood from thy cleaving bo&s;om! It did&mdash;it did. Uttering a deep groan, he fell in&s;en&s;ible from his hor&s;e, while his attendants, ha&s;tening tow|ards him, were &s;hocked beyond conception at the di&s;mal &s;pectacle; and, &s;tarting back with averted eyes from the dead, were thun|der &s;truck, not having power to move or &s;peak. After awhile two Indians (who be|ing u&s;ed to &s;anguinary &s;cenes, recovered them&s;elves fir&s;t) took a blanket, and walk|ing backward to the mangled Comelia, threw it over her naked body; the others then timidly advanced, and Mr. Kittle open|ing his eyes groaned again bitterly; then rai&s;ing him&s;elf on his knees, with a look of unutterable angui&s;h, he called upon his dear Maria. Alas! no voice but the &s;olemn re|petition of his own cries was articulated to
<PB N="29" REF="031837_0028_0FEECD9232A23C08">
him: then ri&s;ing with an air of di&s;traction, he &s;talked round the bloody &s;cene, and exa|mined the dead bodies; fir&s;t uncovering the pale vi&s;age of Comelia, he &s;urveyed in &s;i|lence her di&s;torted features; but perceiving it was not Maria, he gently laid the cloth over again, and turning furiou&s;ly, caught up his gha&s;tly infant, who&s;e little body was black with contu&s;ions, and his &s;kull horribly fractured. Almo&s;t fainting under his mournful load, and &s;taggering at the dread|ful di&s;covery, he depo&s;ited it again on the bloody earth, and clapping his hands toge|ther repeatedly with violence, "O hell! hell!" he cried, "you cannot inflict tor|ments &s;o exqui&s;ite as tho&s;e I now &s;uffer! how am I cru&s;hed to the center! how deep|ly am I degraded below the worms of the &s;od! O my children! my children! where are you now? O my wife! my Maria! the beloved of my bo&s;om, are you too fallen a &s;acrifice? Why do I &s;urvive the&s;e mi&s;eries, my God? how can mortality &s;upport them? Bur&s;t&mdash;bur&s;t my &s;hrinking heart, and pun|i&s;h a wretch for not having died in the de|fence of &s;uch lovely and innocent beings! Oh! why was I ab&s;ent in this fatal hour? why did not their groans vibrate on my &s;oul
<PB N="30" REF="031837_0029_0FEECE13D7295A10">
that I might have flown to their aid!" Thus wildly lamenting and wandering among the &s;moaking ruins, he picked up &s;ome of the calcined bones of his once beautiful An|na. At this &s;ight de&s;pair &s;hook his &s;oul a|fre&s;h, new agonies convul&s;ed his features, and dropping the &s;ad evidence of his mi&s;e|ries, he extended his arms to Heaven, and roared out, "Revenge! great God! re|venge if thou art ju&s;t and kind as repre&s;ent|ed! Oh! that I had the power of an arch|angel to thunder eternal horrors on the guil|ty wretches who have bla&s;ted the bud of my happine&s;s who have darkened the brighte&s;t eyes that ever opened on the light!"</P>
<P>The men here interfering, to con&s;ole him ob&s;erved, the bones were probably tho&s;e of his brother Peter; but on finding his &s;kele|ton entire, Mr. Kittle in&s;i&s;ted that it mu&s;t have been Maria and Anna, who, having hid them&s;elves, had doubtle&s;s peri&s;hed in the flames. Again, in the furious extrava|gance of pa&s;&s;ion, he tore the hair from his head, and ca&s;ting him&s;elf pro&s;trate on the a&s;hes, he gathered the crumbling bones to his bo&s;om, while the big drops of angui&s;h i&s;&s;ued at every pore, till life, unable longer to &s;u&s;tain the mental conflict, &s;u&s;pended her
<PB N="31" REF="031837_0030_0FEECD7B790F8758">
powers, and once more deprived him of &s;en|&s;ation. His companions having laid him on a waggon, now conferred together in what manner to proceed, and apprehending an attack from the &s;avages, they unanimou&s;ly concluded to lay the dead bodies on the re|maining carriage, and make the be&s;t of their way to <HI>Schochticook,</HI> which they according|ly performed with great &s;ilence and expedi|tion.</P>
<P>You may judge, my dear, what a panic the appearance of this mournful cavalcade &s;truck over the inhabitants of this defence|le&s;s village. Mr. Kittle was gently laid on a bed, and being let blood, his re&s;piration be|came le&s;s ob&s;tructed, though he continued &s;en&s;ele&s;s till his unfortunate family were in|terred. Six weeks elap&s;ed before he reco|vered any degree of &s;trength; but even then he appeared pale and emaciated like a &s;e|cond Lazarus; his di&s;po&s;ition was entirely changed, his looks were fierce, his attitudes wild and extravagant, and his conver&s;ation, which was formerly &s;en&s;ible, commanding attention by a mu&s;ical voice, now was inco|herent, and his cadence deep and hollow, rather in&s;piring terror than any plea&s;ing &s;en|&s;ation. Thir&s;ting for revenge, and perceiv|ing
<PB N="32" REF="031837_0031_0FEECD87A772B588">
that &s;olitude only tended to corrode his moments with the blacke&s;t melancholy, he &s;oon after entered the Briti&s;h &s;ervice in the capacity of gentleman volunteer, and &s;igna|lized him&s;elf by his prudence and intrepidi|ty, attracting the particular notice of his of|ficers, who being affected with his misfor|tunes, proffered their &s;ervices to him with &s;o much friend&s;hip and candour, as obliged him to accept of them, and yet lightened the obligation.</P>
<P>But doubtle&s;s, my dear, your generous &s;en&s;ibility is alarmed at my &s;ilence about Mrs. Kittle; I think we left her repo&s;ing under a tree; &s;he was the fir&s;t that awaked as the &s;un began to exhale the cry&s;tal glo|bules of morning, when half ri&s;ing, and re|clining on her elbow, &s;he &s;urveyed the love|ly land&s;cape around her with a deep &s;igh; they were on an eminence that commanded an unlimited pro&s;pect of the country every way. The birds were cheerful; the deer bounded fearle&s;s over the hills; the meadows blu&s;hed with the enamel of Flora; but grief had &s;addened every object in her &s;ight; the whole creation &s;eemed a dark blank to the fair mourner. Again recollection un|locked the &s;luices of her eyes, and her &s;elf
<PB N="33" REF="031837_0032_0FEECD7ECA8BB8E8">
complaints di&s;turbed her &s;avage compani|ons, who, ri&s;ing and kindling up the dying embers, began to prepare their victuals, which they invited her to partake of. This &s;he declined with vi&s;ible dete&s;tation; and, turning to her brother with the dignity of con&s;cious merit in di&s;tre&s;s, "No," &s;aid &s;he, "I will never receive a mor&s;el from tho&s;e bloody hands yet dropping with recent mur|der!&mdash;let me peri&s;h&mdash;let the iron hand of famine fir&s;t pinch out my vitals, and &s;end me after my children!" Notwith&s;tanding this, Henry added his &s;olicitations that &s;he &s;hould accept of &s;ome refre&s;hment, reminding her of her fatal re&s;olution, which could be deem|ed no otherwi&s;e than &s;uicide. Finding this had no effect, he tried to touch her feelings on a &s;ofter key&mdash;"Remember, Maria," &s;aid he, "you have a tender hu&s;band yet living; would you wi&s;h to deprive him of every earthly con&s;olation? Would you add affliction to affliction, and after he has per|formed the &s;orrowful ob&s;equies of his chil|dren, to cru&s;h all his remaining hope by the news of your voluntary death? No, live my &s;i&s;ter! be a&s;&s;ured he will &s;oon get us ex|changed, when &s;oft &s;ympathies &s;hall wa&s;h away your &s;orrows; and after a few years,
<PB N="34" REF="031837_0033_0FEECDD6093F9978">
who knows but the &s;miles of a new lovely progeny may again draw a paradi&s;e of hap|pine&s;s on you." Maria was affected, and half rai&s;ing her eyes from the earth, &s;he re|plied, "O my brother! how con&s;oling do your words &s;ink on my heart! though my rea&s;on tells me your arguments are impro|bable and fallacious, yet it &s;oothes the tem|pe&s;t of my &s;oul&mdash;I will try to live&mdash;perhaps I may again behold my dear&mdash;dear&mdash;dear hu&s;band!" Here a flood of tears interrupted her.</P>
<P>As this conver&s;ation was held in Engli&s;h, the &s;avages were inqui&s;itive to know the &s;ub|ject of it, at the &s;ame time enjoining them both never to utter a &s;yllable in their pre|&s;ence, except in their own uncouth dialect, which, as they perfectly under&s;tood, they could not excu&s;e them&s;elves from. Henry then informed them that his &s;i&s;ter, objecting to their method of preparing food, had de|&s;ired him to prevail with them to indulge her in dre&s;&s;ing her meals her&s;elf. This they readily granted, and farther to ingratiate them&s;elves in the pri&s;oner's favour, they di&s;patched a young Indian to hunt for par|tridges or quails in the groves adjoining them: He in&s;tantly returned with a brood
<PB N="35" REF="031837_0034_0FEE9339BAC0E4C0">
of wood-pidgeons, &s;carcely fledged, which he pre&s;ented to Henry, who cleaned and broiled them on &s;ticks, with an officious &s;olicitude to plea&s;e his &s;i&s;ter, which &s;he ob|&s;erved with a look of gratitude, and taking a pigeon from the &s;tick, began to eat more from complai&s;ance than inclination. Hen|ry was delighted at her ready acquie&s;cence, and their repa&s;t being ended, they proceed|ed on their tire&s;ome journey with le&s;s re|pining than the preceding night. Maria was exempted from carrying a burden, yet &s;he found the fatigue almo&s;t intolerable. They continually pa&s;&s;ed through a &s;cene of conflagration, the &s;avages firing every cottage in their way, who&s;e mournful blaze catching the dry fields of grain, would &s;corch off hundreds of acres in a few mo|ments, and form a burning path for their de&s;troyers. As the &s;un advanced to his zenith, its rays beat fiercely on our travel|lers, augmented by the crackling flames a|round them; when meeting with a cool &s;tream of water, Maria was commanded to &s;it down (being over-heated) while the re&s;t approached the rivulet: the Indian that guarded Maria was &s;tooping down to drink, when a loud ru&s;tling among the leaves and
<PB N="36" REF="031837_0035_0FEECDD78EF51230">
trampling of bu&s;hes attracted his attention; he li&s;tened awhile &s;eemingly much alarmed, then &s;tarting up &s;uddenly, he flew to Maria, and caught hold of her hair, aiming his hat|chet at her head: the con&s;equence was ob|vious, and her fate &s;eemed inevitable; yet, with a &s;toical compo&s;ure, &s;he folded her arms acro&s;s, and waited the fatal &s;troke with perfect re&s;ignation; but while the weapon was yet &s;u&s;pended over her, chanc|ing to look around, he perceived the noi&s;e to proceed from a large deer, who&s;e antlers were entangled in the branches of a thicket. Though an uncivilized inhabitant of the fo|re&s;t, he blu&s;hed at his precipitancy, and re|turning the in&s;trument of death to his gir|dle, after &s;ome he&s;itation made this apology: "Maria, this &s;udden di&s;covery is well for you; I thought we had been pur&s;ued, and we never &s;uffer our pri&s;oners to be re-tak|en; however, I was imprudent to attempt your life before there was a probability of your being re&s;cued:" then de&s;iring her to ri&s;e and drink, he quickly &s;hot the deer, his a&s;&s;ociates helping him to &s;kin it. In&s;tead of quenching her thir&s;t &s;he &s;at down pen|&s;ive on the &s;lowery margin, ca&s;ting her eyes carele&s;sly on the &s;tream: &s;he knew not whe|ther
<PB N="37" REF="031837_0036_0FEECD4F3760A6A8">
to e&s;teem her late deliverance from death a happy providence or protraction of mi&s;ery. Ob&s;erving the &s;potted trout, and other fi&s;h, to dart &s;portively acro&s;s the wa|ter, &s;he could not help exclaiming, "Hap|py! happy animals! you have not the fatal gift of rea&s;on to embitter your plea&s;ures; you cannot anticipate your difficulties by apprehen&s;ion, or prolong them by recol|lection; incapable of offending your Cre|ator, the ble&s;&s;ings of your exi&s;tence are &s;e|cured to you: Alas! I envy the meane&s;t among ye!" A gu&s;h of tears concluded her &s;oliloquy; and being called to attend the company, &s;he aro&s;e, and they began their journey for the afternoon. Henry de&s;iring to have a piece of veni&s;on (having left it behind, &s;eldom incommoding them&s;elves with more than the hide and tallow) they returned and obliged him with a haunch, which was very fat: at the next interval of travel he dre&s;&s;ed it for him&s;elf and Maria. In the evening they cro&s;&s;ed the river &s;ome|what below <HI>Fort-Edward,</HI> in a canoe left hid under &s;ome bu&s;hes for that purpo&s;e. They ob&s;erved the mo&s;t profound &s;ilence until they entered the woods again; but it was very late before they halted, which
<PB N="38" REF="031837_0037_0FEECDF363FBE230">

It was nece&s;&s;ary here to light a fire, for the wolves howled mo&s;t dreadful|ly, and the whole fore&s;t rung with the cries of wild bea&s;ts of various &s;orts. The con|fines of hell could not have given Maria more di&s;mal ideas than her pre&s;ent &s;itua|tion: the horrid gloom of the place, the &s;cowling looks of her murderous compan|ions, the &s;hrill &s;hrieks of owls, the loud cries of the wolf, and mournful &s;creams of panthers, which were redoubled by di&s;tant echoes as the terrible &s;ounds &s;eemed dying away, &s;hook her frame with cold tremors&mdash; &s;he &s;unk under the oppre&s;&s;ion of terror, and almo&s;t fainted on Henry's arms; how|ever, on perceiving the bea&s;ts dur&s;t not ap|proach the light, but began to retire, &s;he became a little more a&s;&s;ured, and helped Henry to erect a booth of pine branches, making a bed of the &s;ame materials in it while he prepared their &s;upper: having ea|ten, and kindled a large fire in the front of her arbour, &s;he laid down and &s;oon fell in a deep &s;leep. She felt her&s;elf refre&s;hed by this unexpected repo&s;e, and the next morn|ing, with &s;ome alacrity, continued her jour|ney,

hoping at la&s;t to arrive at &s;ome Chri&s;|tian &s;ettlement. Arriving at <HI>Lake-Cham|plain,</HI> they rai&s;ed a wigwam on the bank, expecting the coming of Indians from the oppo&s;ite &s;hore to carry them over.</P>
<P>Here our unfortunate captives were &s;tript of their habits, already rent to pieces by briers, and attired each with remnants of old blankets. In this new dre&s;s Mrs. Kit|tle ventured to expo&s;tulate with the &s;avag|es, but it was talking to the &s;tormy ocean; her complaints &s;erved only to divert them; &s;o retiring among the bu&s;hes, &s;he adju&s;ted her coar&s;e dre&s;s &s;omewhat decently, and then &s;eating her&s;elf &s;ilently under a &s;pread|ing tree, indulged her&s;elf in the luxury of &s;orrow. Henry, &s;en&s;ible that they expect|ed more fortitude from him, and that if he &s;unk under his adver&s;e fortune he &s;hould be wor&s;e treated, affected to be cheerful; he a&s;&s;i&s;ted them in catching &s;almon, with which the lake abounds; an incredible quantity of wild fowl frequenting the lake al&s;o, he laid &s;nares for tho&s;e of the le&s;&s;er &s;ort, (not being allowed fire-arms) and &s;uc|ceeded &s;o well, that his dexterity was high|ly commended, and night coming on, they regaled them&s;elves on the fruits of their in|du&s;try.

The night was exceedingly dark, but calm; a thick mi&s;t hovered over the woods, and the &s;mall ridgy waves &s;oftly rol|led to the &s;hore, when &s;uddenly a large me|teor, or fiery exhalation, pa&s;&s;ed by them with &s;urpri&s;ing velocity, ca&s;ting on every &s;ide &s;howers of brilliant &s;parkles. At &s;ight of this phaenomenon the Indians put their heads between their knees, crying out in a lamentable voice, "Do not! do not! do not!" continuing in the &s;ame attitude un|til the vapour di&s;appeared. Henry, with &s;ome &s;urpri&s;e demanded the rea&s;on of this exclamation; to which they replied, "What he had &s;een was a fiery dragon on his pa&s;|&s;age to his den, who was of &s;o malevolent a temper, that he never failed, on his arri|val there, to inflict &s;ome peculiar calamity on mankind." In about five minutes after the earth was violently agitated, the waves of the lake tumbled about in a &s;trange man|ner, &s;eeming to omit fla&s;hes of fire, all the while attended with mo&s;t tremendous roar|ings, intermixed with loud noi&s;es, not un|like the explo&s;ion of heavy cannon. Soon as the Indians perceived it was an earth|quake, they cried out, "Now he comes home!" and ca&s;ting them&s;elves in their

This was a terrible &s;cene to Maria, who had never been witne&s;s to &s;o dreadful a convul&s;ion of Nature before; &s;he &s;tarted up and fled from her &s;avage companions towards an eminence at &s;ome di&s;tance, where, dropping on her knees, &s;he emphatically implored the protection of Heaven: however, &s;he was followed by an Indian and Henry; the latter, highly af|fected with her di&s;tre&s;&s;es, taking hold of her trembling hand, "But why, my &s;i&s;ter!" &s;aid he, "have you fled from us? is the gloom of a fore&s;t more cheering than the &s;ympathi&s;ing looks of a friend?" No, my brother!" replied Maria; "but the tho't was &s;ugge&s;ted to me, that the &s;upreme God perhaps was preparing to avenge him&s;elf of the&s;e murderers by &s;ome awful and uncom|mon judgment, and I fled from them as Lot did from <HI>Sodom,</HI> le&s;t I might be involved in the puni&s;hment of their guilt." They con|ver&s;ed in Engli&s;h, which di&s;plea&s;ing the In|dian, he ordered them to return to the wigmam, threatening to bind Maria fa&s;t if &s;he offered to elope again.

from the north and chilled our half-naked travellers with exce&s;&s;ive cold. The &s;avages (who&s;e callous &s;kins were proof a|gain&s;t the inclement weather) not caring to continue their fires, le&s;t they &s;hould be di&s;|covered and &s;urpri&s;ed by &s;ome Engli&s;h par|ty, they pa&s;&s;ed here a very uncomfortable night; but the wind &s;ub&s;iding, and the &s;ky growing clear, the &s;un ro&s;e peculiarly warm and plea&s;ant, &s;treaming ten thou&s;and rays of gold acro&s;s the lake. Maria had &s;carcely performed her orai&s;ons, when the &s;avages, forming a circle round her and Henry, be|gan to dance in a mo&s;t extravagant manner, and with antic ge&s;tures that at another time would have afforded mirth to our travellers. Having continued their exerci&s;e &s;ome time, they incontinently drew out boxes of paint, and began to ornament their captives with a variety of colours; one having cro&s;&s;ed their faces with a &s;troke of vermilion, another would inter&s;ect it with a line of black, and &s;o on until the whole company had given a &s;pecimen of their &s;kill or fancy.</P>

were obliged to halt for two days, on ac|count of Maria's inability to travel, her feet being greatly &s;woln and lacerated by the flinty path. At length, by ea&s;y &s;tages, they came in view of an Indian &s;ettlement, when Maria's long unbent features relaxed into a half &s;mile, and turning to Henry&punc; "Here my brother!" &s;aid &s;he, "I <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> &s;ome of my own &s;ex, to whom <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> Nature, no doubt, has taught humanity; this is the fir&s;t precept &s;he inculcates in the female mind, and this they generally retain thro' life, in &s;pite of every evil propen&s;ity." As &s;he uttered this eulogium in favour of the fair, the tawny villagers, perceiving their approach, ru&s;hed promi&s;cuou&s;ly from their huts with an execrable din, and &s;ell upon the weary captives with clubs and a &s;hower of &s;tones, accompanying their &s;trokes with the mo&s;t virulent language; among the re&s;t an old deformed &s;quaw, with the rage of a Ti&s;iphone, flew to Maria, aiming a pine-knot at her head, and would certainly have given the wretched mourner her quietus had &s;he not been oppo&s;ed by the &s;avage that guarded Mrs. Kittle: he at fir&s;t mildly ex|po&s;tulated with his pa&s;&s;ionate countrywo|man; but finding the old hag frantic, and

in&s;atiable of blood, he twi&s;ted the pine-knot from her hand and whirled it away to &s;ome di&s;tance, then &s;eizing her arm roughly and tripping up her heels, he laid her pro&s;trate, leaving her to howl and yell at lei&s;ure, which &s;he performed without a prompter. &mdash;Maria was all in a tremor, and ha&s;tily followed her deliverer, not caring to ri&s;k another encounter with the exa&s;perated vi|rago.

<P>Mrs. Kittle and her brother complaining of the brui&s;es they met with at their recep|tion, an old Indian &s;eemed to attend with great concern; then leaving the place, in a little time returned with a bundle of aro|matic herbs under his arm, the juice of which he expre&s;&s;ed by rubbing them be|tween two &s;tones with flat &s;urfaces; this he gave them to drink, applying the leaves ex|ternally.

Di&s;covering her &s;ituation, &s;he blu&s;hingly withdrew to a dark corner from the public gaze, and could not help &s;ighing to her&s;elf, "Alas! but a very few days ago I was hailed as the hap|pie&s;t of women&mdash;my fond hu&s;band antici|pated all my de&s;ires&mdash;my children &s;miled round me with filial delight&mdash;my very &s;er|vants paid me the homage due to an angel &mdash;O my God! what a &s;udden, what a de|plorable tran&s;ition!

As &s;he thus moralized on her &s;ituation, an Engli&s;h woman (whom hu|manity more than curio&s;ity had drawn to the place) approached Maria, and ob&s;erv|ing her tears and deep dejection, took hold of her hand, and endeavoured to &s;mile; but the &s;oft impul&s;es of nature were too

&s;trong for the efforts of di&s;&s;imulation&mdash;her features in&s;tantly &s;addened again, and &s;he bur&s;t into tears, exclaiming, (with a he&s;itat|ing voice,) "Poor, forlorn creature! where are thy friends! perhaps the dying moments of thy fond parent, or hu&s;band, have been cruelly embittered with the &s;ight of thy cap|tivity! perhaps now thy helple&s;s orphan is mourning for the brea&s;t which gave him nouri&s;hment! or thy plaintive little ones are wondering at the long ab&s;ence of their mi|&s;erable mother!"&mdash;"Oh! no more! no more!" interrupted Maria; "your pity is &s;everer than &s;avage cruelty&mdash;I could &s;tand the &s;hock of fortune with &s;ome degree of firmne&s;s, but your &s;oft &s;ympathy opens a|fre&s;h the wounds of my &s;oul! my lo&s;&s;es are beyond your conjecture&mdash;I have no parent, no &s;portive children, and, I believe, no hu&s;|band, to mourn and wi&s;h for me!" The&s;e words were &s;ucceeded by an affecting &s;i|lence on both &s;ides: meanwhile the Indians te&s;tified their impatience to be admitted to the Governor by frequent &s;houts; at length his Excellency appeared, and having held a conference with the &s;avages, they retired with his Secretary, and our pri&s;oners &s;aw them no more.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="031837_0047_0FEECDBC8EC937A0">After their exit the Governor turning round to Maria and Henry, demanded who they were? Mrs. Kittle's perplexity pre|vented her reply; but Henry, in a mo&s;t re&s;pectful manner, gave him a &s;uccinct ac|count of their misfortunes. The Govern|or perceiving him &s;en&s;ible and communi|cative, interrogated him farther, but he mode&s;tly declined giving any political in|telligence. Ob&s;erving that Maria &s;uffered greatly in this interview, he &s;oon conclud|ed it, after having pre&s;ented &s;everal pieces of calicoes and &s;tuffs to them, de&s;iring they would accept what they had occa&s;ion for.

<P>Henry was accommodated at a baker's, while his &s;i&s;ter, to her no &s;mall &s;atisfaction, found her&s;elf placed at the Engli&s;h woman's who, on her arrival, had expre&s;&s;ed &s;o much good nature. She had &s;carcely entered,

<P>This tenderne&s;s, which Maria had long been a &s;tranger to, relaxed every fibre of her heart: &s;he again melted into tears; but it was a gu&s;h of grateful acknowledg|ment, that called a mode&s;t blu&s;h of plea&s;|ure and perplexity on Mrs. D&mdash;'s cheek.

<P>"My heart, ladies, &s;hall ever retain a &s;en&s;e of the happine&s;s I enjoyed in the &s;o|ciety of Mrs. Kittle and &s;everal other ami|able per&s;ons in the vicinage of <HI>Schochticook,</HI> where I re&s;ided. She in particular cheered my lonely hours of widowhood, and omit|ted nothing that &s;he thought might conduce to my &s;erenity. I had two &s;ons; &s;he re|commended the education of them to my lei&s;ure hours. I accepted her advice, and found a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of my &s;orrows in the execution of my duty. They &s;oon impro|ved beyond my capacity of teaching. Ri|chard, my elde&s;t, was pa&s;&s;ionately fond of books, which he &s;tudied with inten&s;e appli|cation. This naturally attached him to a &s;edentary life, and he became the con&s;tant in&s;tructive companion of my evening hours. My younge&s;t &s;on, Charles, was more vola|tile,
<PB N="54" REF="031837_0053_0FEECE155CB3B7A0">
yet not le&s;s agreeable; his per&s;on was charming, his wit &s;prightly and his addre&s;s elegant. They often importuned me, at the commencement of this war, to with|draw to <HI>Albany;</HI> but, as I apprehended no danger, (the Briti&s;h troops being &s;tationed above us, quite from <HI>Saratoga</HI> to the Lake) I ridiculed their fears.</P>
<P>"One evening as my &s;ons were come in from reaping, and I was bu&s;ied in prepar|ing them a di&s;h of tea, we were &s;urpri&s;ed by a di&s;charge of mu&s;quetry near us. We all three ran to the door, and beheld a party of Indians not twenty paces from us. Struck with a&s;toni&s;hment, we had no power to move; and the &s;avages again firing that in|&s;tant my Charles dropped down dead be|&s;ide me. Good God! what were my emo|tions! But language would fail, &s;hould I attempt to de&s;cribe them. My &s;urviving &s;on then turning to me, with a countenance expre&s;&s;ive of the deepe&s;t horror, urged me to fly. "Let us be gone this in&s;tant," &s;aid he;
<Q>another moment determines our &s;ate. O my mother! you are already lo&s;t.</Q>
But de&s;pair had &s;wallowed up my fears; I fell &s;hrieking on the body of my child, and rending away my hair, endea|voured

to recall him to life by unavailing laments. Richard, in the meanwhile had quitted me, and the moment after I beheld him mounted on hor&s;eback, and &s;tretching away to the city. The Indians fired a vol|ley at him, but mi&s;&s;ed, and, I flatter my&s;elf that he arrived &s;afe. And now, not all my prayers and tears could prevent the wretch|es from &s;calping my precious child. But when they rent me away from him, and dragged me from the hou&s;e, my grief and rage bur&s;t forth like a hurricane. I execra|ted their whole race, and called for eternal vengeance to cru&s;h them to atoms. After a while I grew a&s;hamed of my impetuo&s;ity: the tears began again to flow &s;ilently on my cheek; and, as I walked through the for|e&s;t between two Indians, my &s;oul grew &s;ud|denly &s;ick and groaned in me; a darkne&s;s, more &s;ub&s;tantial than Egyptian night, felt upon it, and my exi&s;tence became an in&s;up|portable burden to me. I looked up to Heaven with a hopele&s;s kind of awe, but I murmured no more at the di&s;pen&s;ations of my God; and in this frame of &s;ullen re|&s;ignation I pa&s;&s;ed the re&s;t of my journey, which being nearly &s;imilar to Mrs. Kittle's, I &s;hall avoid the repetition of.

You indeed have proved the good Samaritan to me, pouring oil and wine in my wounds."&mdash; "Hu&s;h, hu&s;h, (cried Madame De Roche,) you e&s;timate our &s;ervices at too high a rate.

<P>"I now reject (interrupted Mrs. Bratt,) all prejudices of education. From my in|fancy have I been taught that the French were a cruel perfidious enemy, but I have found them quite the rever&s;e."</P>
<P>Madame De R. willing to change the &s;ub|ject, acco&s;ted the other &s;tranger,&mdash;"Dear Mrs. Willis, &s;hall we not be intere&s;ted like|wi&s;e in your misfortunes?"&mdash;"Ah! do (added Madamoi&s;elle V.) my heart is now &s;weetly tuned to melancholy.

tears; but a&s;&s;uming a compo&s;ed look, &s;he began:&mdash;</P>
<P>"I am the daughter of a poor clergy|man, who being confined to his chamber by &s;ickne&s;s, for &s;everal years, amu&s;ed him|&s;elf by educating me. At his death, find|ing my&s;elf friendle&s;s, and without money, I accepted the hand of a young man who had taken a lea&s;ed farm in Pen&s;ylvania. He was very agreeable, and extravagantly fond of me. We lived happily for many years in a kind of frugal affluence. When the &s;avages began to commit outrages on the frontier &s;ettlements, our neighbours, intimidated at their rapid approaches, erec|ted a &s;mall fort, &s;urrounded by a high pa|li&s;ade. Into this the more timorous drove their cattle at night; and one evening, as we were at &s;upper, my hu&s;band (being or|dered on guard) in&s;i&s;ted that I &s;hould ac|company him with the children (for I had two lovely girls, one turned of thirteen years, and another of &s;ix months.) My Sophia a&s;&s;ented to the propo&s;al with joy.
<Q>Mamma, (&s;aid &s;he) what a merry woman the Captain's wife is; &s;he will divert us the whole evening, and &s;he is very fond of your company: come, I will take our
<PB N="58" REF="031837_0057_0FEECDE0A288CE18">
little Charlotte on my arm, and papa will carry the lantern.</Q>
I acceded with a nod; and already the dear charmer had handed me my hat and gloves, when &s;ome|body thundered at the door. We were &s;ilent as death, and in&s;tantly after plainly could di&s;tingui&s;h the voices of &s;avages con|ferring together. Chilled as I was with fear, I flew to the cradle, and catching my infant, ran up into a loft. Sophia follow|ed me all trembling, and panting for breath ca&s;t her&s;elf in my bo&s;om. Hearing the In|dians enter, I looked through a crevice in the floor, and &s;aw them, with menacing looks, &s;eat them&s;elves round the table, and now and then addre&s;s them&s;elves to Mr. Willis, who, all pale and a&s;toni&s;hed, nei|ther under&s;tood nor had power to an&s;wer them. I ob&s;erved they took a great plea&s;|ure in terrifying him, by flouri&s;hing their knives, and ga&s;hing the table with their hatchets. Alas! this &s;ight &s;hot icicles to my &s;oul; and, to increa&s;e my di&s;tre&s;s, my Sophia's little heart beat again&s;t my brea&s;t, with redoubled &s;trokes, at every word they uttered.</P>
<P>"Having fini&s;hed their repa&s;t in a glut|tinous manner, they laid a fire-brand in
<PB N="59" REF="031837_0058_0FEECDD2F97430E0">
each corner of the chamber, and then de|parted, driving poor Mr. Willis before them. The &s;moke &s;oon incommoded us; but we dreaded our barbarous enemy more than the fire. At length, however, the flames beginning to invade our retreat, trembling and apprehen&s;ive, we ventured down &s;tairs; the whole hou&s;e glowed now like a fur|nace; the flames rolled towards the &s;tairs, which we ha&s;tily de&s;cended; but ju&s;t as I &s;at my foot on the thre&s;hold of the door, a piece of timber, nearly con&s;umed through, gave way, and fell on my left arm, which &s;upported my infant, mi&s;erably fracturing the bone. I in&s;tantly caught up my fallen lamb, and ha&s;tened to overtake my Sophia. There was a large hollow tree contiguous to our hou&s;e, with an aperture ju&s;t large enough to admit &s;o &s;mall a woman as I am. Here we had often laughingly propo&s;ed to hide our children, in ca&s;e of a vi&s;it from the olive coloured natives. In this we now took &s;helter; and being &s;eated &s;ome time, my &s;oul &s;eemed to awake as it were from a vi&s;ion of horror: I lifted up my eyes, and beheld the cottage that lately circum|&s;cribed all my worldly wealth and delight, melting away before the devouring fire.
<PB N="60" REF="031837_0059_0FEECDD48313C7E0">
I dropt a tear as our apo&s;tate fir&s;t parents did when thru&s;t out from <HI>Eden.</HI></P>
<P>"The world lay all before them, where to chu&s;e their place of re&s;t, and Providence their guide. Ah, Eve! thought I, had&s;t thou been like me, &s;olitary, maimed, and unprotected, thy &s;ituation had been deplo|rable indeed. Then pre&s;&s;ing my babe to my heart,
<Q>How quiet art thou, my angel, (&s;aid I;) &s;ure&mdash;&s;ure, Heaven has &s;tilled thy little plaints in mercy to us.</Q>
&mdash;
<Q>Ah! (&s;obbed Sophia,) now I am comforted a|gain that I hear my dear mamma's voice. I was afraid grief would have forever de|prived me of that happine&s;s.</Q>
And here &s;he ki&s;&s;ed my babe and me with vehemence. When her tran&s;ports were moderated,&mdash;
<Q>How cold my &s;i&s;ter is, (&s;aid &s;he) do wrap her up warmer, mamma; poor thing, &s;he is not u&s;ed to &s;uch uncomfortable lodging.</Q></P>
<P>"The pain of my arm now called for all my fortitude and attention; but I forbore to mention this afflicting circum&s;tance to my daughter.</P>
<P>"The cheerful &s;wallow now began to u&s;her in the dawn with melody; we timid|ly prepared to quit our hiding place&punc; and
<PB N="61" REF="031837_0060_0FEECE09A42DCB88">
turning round to the light, I ca&s;t an anxious eye of love on my innocent, wondering that &s;he &s;lept &s;o long. But oh! horror and mi&s;ery! I beheld her a pale, &s;tiff corp&s;e in my arms; (&s;uffer me to weep, ladies, at the cruel recollection.) It &s;eems the piece of wood that di&s;abled me, had al&s;o cru&s;hed my Charlotte's tender &s;kull, and no won|der my haple&s;s babe was quiet. I could no longer &s;u&s;tain my &s;orrowful burden, but falling pro&s;trate, almo&s;t in&s;en&s;ible at the dreadful di&s;covery, uttered nothing but groans. Sophia's little heart was too &s;u&s;|ceptible for &s;o moving a &s;cene. Di&s;tracted between her concern for me, and her grief for the lo&s;s of her dear &s;i&s;ter, &s;he ca&s;t her|&s;elf be&s;ide me, and with the &s;ofte&s;t voice of &s;orrow, bewailed the fate of her beloved Charlotte&mdash;her &s;weet companion&mdash;her in|nocent, laughing play-fellow. At length we ro&s;e, and Sophia, cla&s;ping all that re|mained of my cherub in her arms,
<Q>Ah! (&s;aid &s;he,) I did engage to carry you, my &s;i&s;ter, but little did I expect in this di&s;|tre&s;&s;ing manner.</Q>
When we came in &s;ight of the fort, though I endeavoured to &s;pirit up my grieved child, yet I found my &s;prings of action begin to move heavily,
<PB N="62" REF="031837_0061_0FEECE00073828E8">
my heart fluttered, and I &s;uddenly fainted away. Sophia, concluding I was dead, ut|tered &s;o piercing a cry, that the centinel looking up, immediately called to tho&s;e in the fort to a&s;&s;i&s;t us. When I recovered, I found my&s;elf in a bed encircled by my kind neighbours, who divided their expre&s;&s;ions of love and condolement between me and my child. I remained in the fort after this; but, ladies, you may think, that be|reft as I was of &s;o kind a hu&s;band and en|dearing child, I &s;oon found my&s;elf &s;olitary and de&s;titute. I wept ince&s;&s;antly; and hearing nothing from my dear Willis, I at length re&s;olved to traver&s;e the wilds of <HI>Ca|nada</HI> in pur&s;uit of him. When I commu|nicated this to my friends, they all &s;trong|ly oppo&s;ed it; but finding me inflexible, they furni&s;hed me with &s;ome money and nece&s;&s;aries, and obtained a permi&s;&s;ion from the Governor to let me go under protect|ion of a flag that was on the way. Hear|ing likewi&s;e that a cartel was drawn for an exchange of pri&s;oners, I &s;at out, flu&s;hed with hope, and with indefatigable indu&s;try and painful &s;olicitude, arrived at <HI>Montreal,</HI> worn to a &s;keleton (as you &s;ee ladies) with fatigue.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="031837_0062_0FEECE068792F700">"I omitted not to inquire of every offi|cer, the names of pri&s;oners who had been brought in. At length I under&s;tood that Mr. Willis had peri&s;hed in jail, on his fir&s;t arrival, of a dy&s;entery.&mdash;Here my expecta|tions terminated in de&s;pair. I had no money to return with, and indeed but for my Sophia no inclination&mdash;the whole world &s;eemed dark and cheerle&s;s to me as the fa|bled region of Cimmeria, and I was nigh peri&s;hing for very want, when Mrs. Bratt, hearing of my di&s;tre&s;s, &s;ought my acquain|tance: &s;he kindly participated my &s;orrows, and too&mdash;too generou&s;ly &s;hared her pur&s;e and bed with me. This, ladies, is the &s;to|ry of a broken-hearted woman; nor &s;hould I have intruded it in any other but the hou&s;e of mourning."</P>
<P>Here &s;he concluded, while the ladies &s;e|verally embracing her, expre&s;&s;ed their ac|knowledgments for the painful ta&s;k &s;he had complied with to oblige their curio&s;ity.&mdash; "Would to Heaven!" &s;aid Madame De R. that the brutal nations were extinct, for never&mdash;never can the united humanity of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Britain</HI> compen&s;ate for the hor|rid cruelties of their &s;avage allies."</P>
<P>They were &s;oon after &s;ummoned to an
<PB N="64" REF="031837_0063_0FEECDBE13B0DCF0">
elegant collation; and having &s;pent be&s;t part of the night together, the gue&s;ts retir|ed to their re&s;pective homes.</P>
<P>During two years, in which the French ladies continued their bounty and friend&s;hip to Mrs. Kittle, &s;he never could gain the lea&s;t intelligence of her hu&s;band. Her let|ters, after wandering through &s;everal pro|vinces, would often return to her hands unopened. De&s;pairing at length of ever &s;eeing him, "Ah!" &s;he would &s;ay to Mrs. D&mdash;, "my poor hu&s;band has undoubted|ly peri&s;hed, perhaps in his fruitle&s;s &s;earch after me, and I am left to be a long&mdash;long burden on your goodne&s;s, a very unprofit|able dependant."</P>
<P>In her friend's ab&s;ence &s;he would de|&s;cend into the kitchen, and &s;ubmit to the mo&s;t menial offices; nor could the &s;ervants prevent her; however, they appri&s;ed Mrs. D&mdash; of it, who &s;eized an opportunity of detecting her at her labour. Being baffled in her humble attempt by the gentle re|proaches of her indulgent patrone&s;s, &s;he &s;at down on the &s;tep of the door, and began to weep. "I believe, good Mrs. D&mdash;," &s;aid &s;he, "were you a hard ta&s;k-ma&s;ter, that ex|acted from the&s;e u&s;ele&s;s hands the mo&s;t &s;la|vi&s;h
<PB N="65" REF="031837_0064_0FEECD624FA62638">
bu&s;ine&s;s, I could acquit my&s;elf with cheerfulne&s;s: my heart is like ice, that brightens and grows firmer by tempe&s;ts, but cannot &s;tand the warm rays of a kind &s;un." Mrs. D&mdash; was beginning to an&s;wer, when hearing a tumult in the &s;treet, they both ha&s;ted to the door, and Maria, ca&s;ting her eyes carele&s;sly over the crowd, in an in|&s;tant recognized the features of her long-lamented hu&s;band, who &s;prang towards her with an unde&s;cribable and involuntary rap|ture: but the tide of joy and &s;urpri&s;e was too &s;trong for the delicacy of her frame: &s;he gave a faint exclamation, and &s;tretch|ing out her arms to receive him, dropped &s;en&s;ele&s;s at his feet. The &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of his ideas was too rapid to admit de&s;cribing. He caught her up, and bearing her in the hall, laid his precious burden on a &s;ettee, kneeling be&s;ide her in a &s;peechle&s;s agony of delight and concern. Meanwhile the &s;pectators found them&s;elves wonderfully af|fected&mdash;the tender contagion ran from bo|&s;om to bo&s;om&mdash;they wept aloud; and the hou&s;e of joy &s;eemed to be the hou&s;e of la|mentation. At length Maria opened her eyes and bur&s;t into a violent fit of tears&mdash; Mr. Kittle, with an&s;wering emotions, &s;ilent|ly
<PB N="66" REF="031837_0065_0FEECE1742A08FC8">
accompanying her; then cla&s;ping his arms endearingly round her, "It is enough, my love," &s;aid he, "we have had our night of affliction, and &s;urely this ble&s;&s;ed meeting is a pre&s;age of a long day of future happi|ne&s;s; let me ki&s;s off tho&s;e tears, and &s;hew by your &s;miles that I am indeed welcome." Maria then bending fondly forward to his bo&s;om, replied, &s;ighing, "Alas! how can your beggared wife give you a proper re|ception? &s;he cannot re&s;tore your prattling babes to your arms&mdash;&s;he comes alone! A|las! her pre&s;ence will only &s;erve to remind you of the trea&s;ures&mdash;the filial delights you have lo&s;t!"&mdash;"God forbid," an&s;wered he, "that I &s;hould repine at the lo&s;s of my &s;maller comforts, when &s;o capital a ble&s;&s;ing as my beloved Maria is &s;o wonderfully re|&s;tored to me." Here he was in civility o|bliged to ri&s;e and receive the compliments of Mrs. Bratt, Mrs. Willis, and Madame De R&mdash;, who, hearing of his arrival, en|tered ju&s;t then, half breathle&s;s with impa|tience and joy. The company increa&s;ed; an elegant dinner was prepared: in &s;hort, the day was devoted to plea&s;ure; and ne|ver was &s;atisfaction more general&mdash;fe&s;tivity glowed on every face, and complacency dimpled every cheek.</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="031837_0066_0FEECDE228184840">After tea Maria withdrew in the garden, to give her beloved an account of what had befallen her during their &s;eparation. The eloquence of &s;orrow is irre&s;i&s;tible. Mr. Kittle wept, he groaned, while all impa&s;|&s;ioned (with long interruptions of grief in her voice) &s;he &s;tammered through her dole|ful hi&s;tory; and yet &s;he felt a great &s;atisfac|tion in pouring her complaints into a bo|&s;om who&s;e feelings were in uni&s;on with her's &mdash;they wept&mdash;they &s;miled&mdash;they mourned, and rejoiced alternately, with an abrupt tran&s;ition from one pa&s;&s;ion to another.</P>
<P>Mr. Kittle, in return, informed her, that having thrown him&s;elf into the army, in hopes of ending a being that grew in&s;up|portable under the reflection of pa&s;t hap|pine&s;s, he tempted death in every action wherein he was engaged, and being di&s;ap|pointed, gave him up to the blacked mel|ancholy. "This gloomy &s;cene," he ob|&s;erved, "would &s;oon have been clo&s;ed by &s;ome act of de&s;peration; but one evening, &s;itting pen&s;ive in his tent, and attentively running over the circum&s;tances of his mis|fortunes, a thought darted on his mind that po&s;&s;ibly his brother Henry might be alive." This was the fir&s;t time the idea of any one
<PB N="68" REF="031837_0067_0FEECD568B4CF990">
of his family's &s;urviving the general murder had pre&s;ented it&s;elf to him, and he caught at the flattering &s;ugge&s;tion as a drowning wretch would at a plank. "Surely, &s;ure|ly," &s;aid he, "my brother lives&mdash;it is &s;ome divine emanation lights up the thought in my &s;oul&mdash;it carries conviction with it: I will go after him&mdash;it &s;hall be the comfort and employment of my life to find out this dear brother&mdash;this la&s;t and only trea&s;ure." Per&s;uaded of the reality of his fancy, he com|municated his de&s;ign to a few of his mili|tary friends; but they only laughed at his extravagance, and &s;trongly di&s;&s;uaded him from &s;o wild an undertaking. Being di&s;|couraged, he de&s;i&s;ted; but &s;hortly after, hearing that a company of pri&s;oners (who were enfranchi&s;ed) were returning to <HI>Que|bec,</HI> he got permi&s;&s;ion to accompany them. After a very fatiguing journey he arrived at <HI>Montreal,</HI> and was immediately introdu|ced to the General Officer, who patiently heard his &s;tory, and treated him with great clemency. Having obtained leave to re|main a few days in town, he re&s;pectfully withdrew, and turning down a &s;treet he inquired of a man who was walking before him, where lodgings were to be let? The
<PB N="69" REF="031837_0068_0FEECD8AAF0B2EB0">
&s;tranger turned about, civilly taking off his hat, when Mr. Kittle, &s;tarting back, grew as pale as a&s;hes&mdash;"Oh, my God!" cried he, panting, "oh! Henry, is it you! is it indeed you! No, it cannot be." Here he was ready to fall; but Henry, with little le&s;s agitation, &s;upported him; and a tavern being at hand, he led him in. The ma&s;ter of the hotel brought in wine, and they drank off many gla&s;&s;es to congratulate &s;o happy a meeting. When their tran&s;ports were abated, Henry ventured to tell him that his Maria was living and well. This was a weight of joy too &s;trong for his en|feebled powers&mdash;he &s;tared wildly about.&mdash; At length, recovering him&s;elf, "Take care Henry," &s;aid he, "this is too tender a point to trifle upon."&mdash;"My brother," re|plied Henry, "be calm, let not your joy have a wor&s;e effect than your grief&mdash;they both came &s;udden, and it behoves a man and a chri&s;tian to &s;hew as much fortitude under the one as the other."&mdash;"Alas! I am prepared for &s;ome woeful deception," cried Mr. Kittle; but, Henry, this &s;u&s;pen&s;e is cruel."&mdash;"By the eternal God!" rejoin|ed his brother, "your Maria, your wife, is in this town, and if you are compo&s;ed e|nough,
<PB N="70" REF="031837_0069_0FEECE20C650A360">
you &s;hall immediately &s;ee her."&mdash; Mr. Kittle could not &s;peak&mdash;he gave his hand to Henry, and while (like the Apo&s;|tles friends) he believed not for joy, he was conducted to her arms, and found his bli&s;s wonderfully real.</P>
