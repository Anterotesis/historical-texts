<P>THE go&s;pel of Je&s;us Chri&s;t breathes a &s;pirit of the pure&s;t benevolence; and if it were univer&s;ally believed and obeyed, it would &s;o renew the heart, &s;often the temper and rectify the behaviour of mankind, as to make this world an habitation of peace and harmony. But, alas, how little influence has this divine religion upon the hearts of men, even tho&s;e among whom it is known and pro|fe&s;&s;ed! In&s;tead of that mild and pacific di&s;po&s;ition which the Prince of Peace requires in all his &s;ubjects, do we not &s;ee boi&s;terous and malignant pa&s;&s;ions u&s;urp|ing the empire of the &s;oul, violating the mo&s;t &s;acred obligations, trampling on rea&s;on and con&s;cience, and &s;etting at defiance the vengeance of heaven? In&s;tead of that love which &s;hould reign among creatures of the &s;ame God, inhabitants of the &s;ame earth, do not hatred and revenge &s;well their bo&s;oms and operate to the de|&s;truction of all order and &s;afety?&mdash;or, &s;ometimes in a more &s;ilent, but not le&s;s de&s;tructive manner, do not &s;ubtilty and deceit undermine the foundations of civil peace, and break tho&s;e bonds of union, on the &s;trength

of which the happine&s;s of &s;ociety depends? To re&s;train the di&s;ordered pa&s;&s;ions, and render life and property more &s;ecure, government and &s;ubordination have taken place, and the inhabitants of the world are by the wi&s;dom of the great providential Ruler formed into various nations and kingdoms, which have each their di&s;tinct laws and rules, founded on rea&s;on and experience; and the "powers that be" in the&s;e &s;everal political bodies
<Q>are ordained of God for the puni&s;hment of evil doers, and for the prai&s;e of them that do well</Q>:<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. xiii.1. 1 Pet. ii.14.</NOTE> He has wi&s;ely delegated to the civil magi&s;trate the power of vengeance which belongeth only to him&s;elf.</P>
<P>But even this wi&s;e and benevolent in&s;titution is not always &s;ufficient to &s;ecure the peace and welfare of &s;ociety; for the &s;ame lu&s;ts which produce jealou&s;ies, hatred and quarrels among individuals, do &s;ometimes operate in a larger &s;phere, and cau&s;e nation to ri&s;e up again&s;t nation, and kingdom again&s;t kingdom. The heads and rulers of &s;ocieties are men of like pa&s;&s;ions and infirmities with their &s;ubjects; they are apt to be blinded by &s;elf-intere&s;t, wedded to particular &s;chemes of policy, inflamed with pride and vain glory, mi&s;led by artful deceivers, and precipitated into mea&s;ures which time and rea&s;on will condemn: Innumerable are the &s;eeds of jealou&s;y and di&s;cord which are &s;own by the grand enemy of mankind, who fails not to improve every opportunity to rai&s;e heats and animo&s;ities, to &s;tir up the depraved pa&s;&s;ions, which are all in his &s;ervice, ready to do his de&s;tructive work; and when public di&s;putes ari&s;e between any of the powers of the earth which cannot be quelled by the voice of rea&s;on, nor &s;a|crificed to the love of peace; when public in&s;ults are committed, and the &s;afety of the commonwealth threat|ened by ho&s;tile inva&s;ion, where can the injured body appeal for a deci&s;ion of the controver&s;y, but to the &s;u|preme Ruler of the world, who
<Q>&s;its in the throne, judging right?</Q>
And how mu&s;t this appeal be made?

God does not interpo&s;e in a miraculous way to rectify the di&s;orders of &s;tates and kingdoms; but as he has implanted in men the principle of &s;elf-pre&s;ervation, and given them the means of defence, &s;o he allows them to repel injuries by violence, and take all prudent ways to guard them&s;elves again&s;t de&s;truction; while he pre|&s;ides over the events of war, keeping them &s;ometimes long in &s;u&s;pen&s;e, and making each party in&s;trumental of puni&s;hing the other, often bringing about revolutions quite different from the intention of the combatants, making the wrath of man to prai&s;e him and accompli&s;h the ju&s;t and wi&s;e de&s;igns of his holy providence.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See I&s;aiah x.5, 6, 7, 12, 13.</NOTE></P>
<P>The nece&s;&s;ity of &s;elf-defence in the kingdoms of this world is evident from the very nature and de&s;ign of &s;ociety, which in this tumultuous and di&s;ordered &s;tate of things cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t without being &s;ufficiently guard|ed again&s;t external injuries. Has the all-wi&s;e and mer|ciful Parent of the univer&s;e furni&s;hed the brute and reptile creation with the nece&s;&s;ary in&s;truments of de|fence? and does the in&s;tinct which he has implanted in them prompt them to make u&s;e of the&s;e weapons for their own &s;ub&s;i&s;tence and &s;ecurity? and has he not im|planted in mankind a natural courage, a martial &s;pirit, and given them &s;kill and power to provide them&s;elves with all the nece&s;&s;ary in&s;truments of defence? and can it be &s;uppo&s;ed that we mu&s;t make no u&s;e of the&s;e gifts of nature, even when providence points out the nece&s;&s;ity? Do we guard our fields from devouring bea&s;ts, our hou&s;es and our bodies from the injuries of the weather? and &s;hall we not have the privilege of defending our lives, our liberties, our property, our families, our civil government from ho&s;tile invaders? Mu&s;t we tamely yield to every lawle&s;s u&s;urper, and &s;uffer tyrants to &s;port with the lives and e&s;tates of mankind? Mu&s;t all tho&s;e laws, which the wi&s;dom and experience of ages have founded; mu&s;t the &s;acred bonds of &s;ociety, the peace, the welfare, the happine&s;s of mankind, be &s;acrificed to

the impetuous rage of a foreign conqueror? Forbid it, rea&s;on and con&s;cience; forbid it, ye heroic worthies of old,
<Q>who through faith &s;ubdued kingdoms, wrought righteou&s;ne&s;s, obtained promi&s;es, &s;topped the mouths of lions, quenched the violence of fire, e&s;caped the edge of the &s;word, out of weakne&s;s were made &s;trong, waxed valiant in fight, turned to flight the armies of the aliens.</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Heb. xi.33, 34.</NOTE></P>
<P>The meek and compa&s;&s;ionate Redeemer of the world, who "came not to de&s;troy men's lives, but to &s;ave them,"<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Luke ix.56.</NOTE> though he commands his di&s;ciples to "live peaceably with all men,"<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rom. xii.18.</NOTE> "to be tender-hearted and forgiving even toward their bittere&s;t per&s;onal enemies,"<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Matt. v.44.</NOTE> yet does not expect that, con&s;idered as members of civil &s;ocieties, they &s;hould tamely &s;ubmit to &s;uch injuries as tend to overthrow the peace and &s;afety of the kingdoms of this world in which they dwell.</P>
<P>What a &s;triking proof of the lawfulne&s;s of &s;elf-defence has our ble&s;&s;ed Lord given us in that noble te&s;timony which he bore to "the truth" when he &s;tood unju&s;tly arraigned before Pilate's bar, explaining and vindicating his claim to the kingdom of I&s;rael. In an&s;wer to Pilate's demands, "whether he was King of the Jews," and "what he had done," our Lord declares,
<Q>My king|dom is not of this world; if my kingdom were of this world, then would my &s;ervants fight, that I &s;hould not be delivered to the Jews; but now is my king|dom not from hence.</Q>
By this "good confe&s;&s;ion"<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Tim. xi.13.</NOTE> he cleared him&s;elf of the charge of being an enemy to Cae&s;ar, and proved that he had no de&s;ign to &s;et up as a rival to the Roman government, yet &s;till holding his claim to the title of King, and declaring the nature of his kingdom to be entirely different from all the king|doms of this world, which cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t without the means of &s;elf-defence. It is plain that Chri&s;t did not
<PB N="9" REF="012667_0008_0F8BE5304BE05820">
allow his di&s;ciples to fight in his defence; for he had ju&s;t before reproved Peter for drawing his &s;word and &s;miting the High Prie&s;t's &s;ervant;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John xviii.10, 11.</NOTE> and it is as plain from our Lord's own declaration, that if his kingdom had been of this world he would have allowed them to fight for him.</P>
<P>In the&s;e remarkable words he di&s;tingui&s;hes the king|dom, at the head of which he was now placed, not only from all the kingdoms of this world in general, but from <HI>the national church or kingdom of I&s;rael</HI> in particular, and this he does by taking away from his &s;piritual kingdom, that, without which no kingdom of this world can &s;ub|&s;i&s;t, <HI>the power of &s;elf-defence.</HI></P>
<P>That Chri&s;t makes a di&s;tinction between his new kingdom, and the ancient kingdom of I&s;rael, appears from this clau&s;e,
<Q>but now is my kingdom not from hence</Q>; the word <HI>now</HI> implies that there was &s;ome alteration made in the nature of his kingdom, or that what was before his kingdom did now cea&s;e to be &s;o, and give way to a more pure and &s;piritual di&s;pen&s;ation.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The reader may &s;ee this point largely illu&s;trated and confirmed in Mr. <HI>Glas</HI>'s Te&s;timony of the King of Martyrs, chap. 2d and 3d.</NOTE> The ancient church of I&s;rael was <HI>the kingdom of God,</HI> a kingdom in which God exerci&s;ed a peculiar kind of government, being their Lord and Sovereign in a &s;en&s;e di&s;tinct from that in which he is the providential Governor of the world: and as we read of God's making him&s;elf <HI>vi&s;ible</HI> at divers times to &s;ome of that favourite nation, with a particular view to the &s;etting up and maintaining of a temporal kingdom; &s;o, we mu&s;t under&s;tand the&s;e as well as all other appearances of the Deity, which are repre&s;ented as <HI>vi&s;ible,</HI> to have been made by Him who is <Q>the brightne&s;s of his glory and the expre&s;s image of his per&s;on <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Heb. i.3.</NOTE>;</Q> for

<P>The grand rea&s;on why this ancient kingdom of I&s;rael was kept &s;o di&s;tinct from other kingdoms of the world, and governed by JEHOVAH in &s;uch a peculiar man|ner, was, that it might be a figurative repre&s;entation of the elect church or &s;piritual kingdom of true believers, who are
<Q>a cho&s;en generation, a royal prie&s;thood, an holy nation, a peculiar people</Q><NOTE N="&sect;&sect;" PLACE="foot">1 Peter ii.9.</NOTE>, who are under the &s;piritual government of Je&s;us Chri&s;t; and therefore when the time of his humiliation was expiring, and he was going to be exalted at the right hand of the Father,
<Q>to be a Prince and a Saviour, to give repentance to [his &s;piritual] I&s;rael and remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins</Q><NOTE N="&para;&para;" PLACE="foot">Acts v.31.</NOTE>, he made a plain declaration, that the nature of his kingdom
<PB N="11" REF="012667_0010_0F8BE531C4244998">
was changed; that whereas it had &s;ub&s;i&s;ted under the form of a temporal kingdom, being confined to one particular nation; now it was a&s;&s;uming a &s;piritual form, and going to be manife&s;ted in its true nature and glory: Whereas before it had been not only lawful but ne|ce&s;&s;ary that his kingdom &s;hould be defended by arms, like all other kingdoms of this world; now it was ap|pearing to be of &s;uch a nature as not to be defended by temporal power and weapons: Whereas before, the &s;eat of his kingdom and the place of his royal re&s;idence had been the city of Jeru&s;alem and the temple which was built therein; now the &s;eat of his kingdom and the place of his re&s;idence was the heaven of heavens, where all &s;incere wor&s;hippers were to meet by faith, round the throne of grace, and where the triumphant company of the redeemed will finally celebrate the victory which their glorious Lord has gained over all his enemies.</P>
<P>We are then to con&s;ider our Lord's words as holding forth to us the&s;e two contra&s;ted truths:
<Q>That when God's kingdom &s;ub&s;i&s;ted under a tem|poral form, as a kingdom of this world, it was both lawful and nece&s;&s;ary that it &s;hould be de|fended by the &s;word.</Q>
But
<Q>That that ancient con&s;titution is now di&s;&s;olved, and the kingdom of God is a &s;piritual kingdom, not of this world, and therefore not capable of being de|fended by the &s;word.</Q></P>
<P>The rea&s;on why God's kingdom, under the former appearance of it, was to be defended by the &s;word, was, that it was a kingdom of this world, containing a mixt|ure of civil and eccle&s;ia&s;tical polity, calculated as well for the temporal pro&s;perity as the &s;piritual improvement of the &s;ubjects: It was liable to be invaded and de&s;troyed by temporal enemies, as it was by Nebuchadnezzar, who de&s;troyed Jeru&s;alem and the temple, and cau&s;ed an
<PB N="12" REF="012667_0011_0F8BE5340B1B6628">
interruption of &s;eventy years in the theocratical go|vernment: And it was al&s;o by God's permi&s;&s;ion finally de&s;troyed by the Roman army under Titus Ve&s;pa&s;ian, from which it has never recovered.</P>
<P>As this was its &s;tate, and as it was liable to &s;uch cala|mities as other kingdoms of this world are; &s;o it was highly nece&s;&s;ary that it &s;hould be guarded and defend|ed in the &s;ame manner as they are. Accordingly, we find the nation of I&s;rael combined together in a <HI>military</HI> form from the beginning of their becoming a &s;eparate people, and the Lord who was their Sovereign bore the &s;tile of "a Man of War," and "God of the armies of I&s;rael:" They went up "harne&s;&s;ed out of the land of Egypt," and kept them&s;elves in a warlike po&s;ture, under the conduct of their divine Leader, all the time of their march through the wilderne&s;s, where they had to encounter divers mighty nations who oppo&s;ed them: They were led in martial array into the Land of pro|mi&s;e by their brave and faithful Jo&s;hua, (who&s;e cha|racter is one of the mo&s;t noble and un&s;potted in the Old Te&s;tament) and divers of the Judges who &s;ucceeded him were heroes of renown, and rendered the nation formi|dable again&s;t its enemies. Numerous are the battles, &s;ieges and victories recorded in the book of God from the days of Mo&s;es to the death of Jo&s;iah; but among them all, the reign of David &s;tands di&s;tingui&s;hed as the time when God granted the greate&s;t &s;ucce&s;&s;es: He was "a man after God's own heart," rai&s;ed up to fulfil his purpo&s;es, to give his people re&s;t, by &s;ubduing all their enemies, and leaving the kingdom in peace to his &s;on Solomon; and herein he was a remarkable type of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, whom God has anointed King on his holy hill of Zion, where
<Q>he mu&s;t reign till he hath &s;ub|dued all enemies under his feet.</Q></P>
<P>Many of the wars recorded in the Jewi&s;h hi&s;tory were undertaken at the expre&s;s command of the God of I&s;rael:<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Judges xx&punc; 18, 23, 28. 2 Sam. v.23, 24.</NOTE> In all ca&s;es of difficulty, direction was &s;ought

of him by the High Prie&s;t, who pre&s;ented the Urim and Thummim in his brea&s;t-plate before the oracle, and re|ceived the divine an&s;wer to the petition of the enquirer: Yea, the warlike actions of the ancient worthies are &s;aid to have been performed "through faith," and by
<Q>the &s;pirit of the Lord coming upon them</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Judges iii.10.vi.34.ix.29, &amp;c.</NOTE>; from whence we conclude not barely that war was <HI>permitted,</HI> like poli|gamy and divorce, but that it was <HI>lawful</HI> and <HI>nece&s;&s;ary</HI> in the kingdom of I&s;rael, which was a kingdom of this world. God not only allowed, but commanded it in particular ca&s;es, and he has no where forbidden it to the kingdoms of this world, nor even to his own people as &s;ubjects of &s;uch kingdoms, nor indeed could he have done it without de&s;troying the very exi&s;tence of political bodies: If then it be God's will that government and order be kept up, and that the kingdoms of this world &s;hould &s;ub&s;i&s;t as &s;uch, then it is his will that they &s;hould u&s;e the means of &s;elf-defence when his providence points out the nece&s;&s;ity.</P>
<P>The mild and forgiving precepts of the go&s;pel might as fairly be pleaded again&s;t the execution of penal laws on malefactors, as again&s;t pre&s;erving the peace of &s;o|ciety by repelling foreign invaders, and de&s;troying tho&s;e who would de&s;troy the foundations of government and property; and it de&s;erves to be &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;idered, whether the &s;uffering an enemy to invade our country and de&s;troy the lives of our friends and neighbours when it is in our power to defend them, would not render us as guilty, in the &s;ight of God, as if we actually murdered them our&s;elves?

It is readily allowed that Chri&s;t here di&s;countenances all attempts to defend <HI>him</HI> and <HI>his kingdom</HI> by the &s;word&mdash;but to &s;ay that it implies that his &s;ervants &s;hall not fight at all, and that tho&s;e that fight are not his &s;ervants, is more than can be proved. Whoever under&s;tands the nature of Chri&s;t's kingdom mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible that an attempt to defend it by arms would be equally ra&s;h and ridiculous, it being ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible to do it. Men may de|fend what they call the kingdom of Chri&s;t, they may defend a form of Chri&s;tianity which has been inter|woven with their civil government, and makes a part of their con&s;titution; &s;uch e&s;tabli&s;hments may be de|fended, and may be de&s;troyed by the &s;word; and if every &s;uch e&s;tabli&s;hment was actually de&s;troyed the kingdom of Chri&s;t would &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;t unhurt; for it is not in the power of men nor devils to aboli&s;h that glorious con&s;titution which is
<Q>built on the foundation of the apo&s;tles and prophets, Je&s;us Chri&s;t him&s;elf being the chief corner &s;tone.</Q>
The &s;eat of Chri&s;t's kingdom is the heaven of heavens, this cannot even be attacked by the proude&s;t a&s;&s;aults of temporal or &s;piritual enemies; and if they &s;hould kill the bodies of the &s;ubjects of this kingdom, which is the utmo&s;t they can do, their &s;ouls would be immediately received into the heavenly Zion, and glorified with their exalted Head: Should all the forms of Chri&s;tianity now &s;ub&s;i&s;ting in the world be

<P>It is in vain then to think of u&s;ing the &s;word in de|fence of Chri&s;t's kingdom; it is &s;o &s;piritual and heavenly in its nature, that no weapon formed again&s;t it &s;hall pro&s;per, nor can any weapon u&s;ed in its defence be of the lea&s;t avail: It is able to &s;ub&s;i&s;t in the world not only without any help from the kingdoms of the world, but even in defiance of all their art and &s;trength, all their malice and enmity again&s;t it. And as it receives no &s;upport from, &s;o it does no injury to them: It does not interfere with any of their natural rights and privi|leges: It makes no alteration in their con&s;titutions: It does not deprive the Prince of the allegiance of his &s;ubjects, nor the &s;ubjects of the protection of their So|vereign; but it leaves all matters relating to civil &s;o|ciety and government in the &s;ame &s;tate as it found them, only enforcing the natural duty of &s;ubjection and obe|dience to the higher powers, from the noble&s;t motives; and as to the natural right which all the kingdoms of this world have to defend them&s;elves by the &s;word, Chri&s;t has never made the lea&s;t alteration, but has ra|ther implicitly <HI>recognized</HI> and allowed it.</P>
<P>From what has been &s;aid I hope it appears &s;ufficiently plain, that to defend and maintain the peace of civil &s;ociety again&s;t foreign inva&s;ion is not only allowable, but is a nece&s;&s;ary and important duty; and it may ju&s;tly be con&s;idered as a branch of that power which God has

<P>Having &s;tated this matter as a point of <HI>duty,</HI> let us go a little further, and &s;ee what may be done in a way of <HI>prudence,</HI> to maintain the peace and happine&s;s of human &s;ociety. And I think it is a very clear con&s;equence from what has been &s;aid, that it is the part of a wi&s;e government to take &s;uch mea&s;ures as &s;hall have the be&s;t tendency to <HI>prevent</HI> any encroachments being made on the natural rights and property of the &s;ubject: If it is lawful to arm again&s;t an invading foe, it is certainly prudent to keep that foe at a di&s;tance, and our&s;elves in &s;uch a po&s;ture of defence as &s;hall intimidate him and prevent his attacks; then, if he is &s;o hardy as to a&s;&s;ault us we &s;hall be the better able to repel him, and if he peri&s;hes in his attempt he is really his own executioner. All this may be done with a very good temper, and in the exerci&s;e of that benevolence which we are to enter|tain toward an enemy, and which is never incon&s;i&s;tent with our own &s;ecurity. If it be known that an hou&s;e is well guarded and defended, the probability is far greater that the owner will &s;leep in peace, than if it was expo&s;ed to be robbed; the ca&s;e is ju&s;t the &s;ame with regard to a nation or kingdom as an individual; if there be proper care taken to render it formidable again&s;t foreign inva&s;ion, it is more likely that the peace of that kingdom will be pre&s;erved, than if it was defencele&s;s,

e&s;pecially if it be an object of de&s;ire in the eyes of a fo|reign Prince. A &s;udden call to arms on the &s;urprize of an enemy's fir&s;t appearance is &s;o terrifying, that, if the u&s;e of arms be not previou&s;ly known, it will pro|duce as many bad con&s;equences as the enemy's attack it&s;elf: It is better therefore to under&s;tand the art of war, though it &s;hould &s;erve only for an amu&s;ement, than by neglecting it to expo&s;e our&s;elves to the hazard of an inva&s;ion, the con&s;equences of which mu&s;t be dread|ful to an unguarded and unprepared people: And as other nations, and tho&s;e in particular whom we have mo&s;t rea&s;on to fear, are expert in the u&s;e of arms, it mu&s;t be a great piece of carele&s;sne&s;s if we &s;uffer our|&s;elves to remain ignorant of an art &s;o e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary to our own &s;afety.</P>
<P>The Briti&s;h continent is now &s;wiftly advancing to|ward &s;uch a degree of opulence as mu&s;t render it an object worthy to be coveted by &s;ome ambitious foe: The European nations cannot but be envious at the va&s;t increa&s;e and pro&s;perity of our empire; and as it is well known that &s;ome of them are as &s;uperior to us in the cabinet as they are inferior in the field, it is far from impo&s;&s;ible that intrigues may be formed to en|tangle our mother country in &s;ome war upon the Eu|ropean continent, in &s;upport of her allies, and divide her maritime forces by rai&s;ing alarms in di&s;tant parts of the globe where we have connexions; and when a &s;uit|able opportunity offers, a de&s;cent may be made on our coa&s;ts, and our friends at home not being able to grant us the nece&s;&s;ary &s;uccours, we mu&s;t be left to defend our|&s;elves: Then, unle&s;s we know the u&s;e of arms, of what avail will be our natural courage? it will only expo&s;e us to be more ea&s;ily marked out as objects of de&s;truction.</P>

<P>For &s;everal years pa&s;t, Great-Britain has experienced the advantage of a regular &s;tanding militia, in rai&s;ing the &s;pirit of the people, and rendering them formidable again&s;t their neighbours. In the beginning of the la&s;t war a general panic run through the nation, upon the news of an intended inva&s;ion, and the preparations that were made from year to year in the ports of France; the numbers of ve&s;&s;els that were &s;aid to be con&s;tructed for a &s;peedy di&s;embarkation of troops rai&s;ed a terrible alarm, and made the nation anxious for their &s;ecurity; but when the genius of Britain awoke and gave birth to the new militia laws, they begun to feel their own &s;trength, di&s;mi&s;&s;ed their foreign allies, and very &s;oon the idea of an inva&s;ion from the flat-bottomed boats of France became as ridiculous as it had been dreadful.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P><Q>The general &s;cheme of the pre&s;ent militia laws is to di&s;cipline a certain number of the inhabitants of every coun|ty, <HI>cho&s;en by lot</HI> for three years, and officered by the Lord Lieutenant, the deputy Lieutenants and other principal Landholders, under a commi&s;&s;ion from the Crown.

re&s;entment; and within a few years after two neigh|bouring plantations &s;uffered like dreadful effects of their fury.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The Indian war which began in Plimouth colony, in 1675, &s;oon &s;pread its fatal effects into the&s;e parts, exciting and encouraging the ea&s;tern Indians to commence ho&s;tilities again&s;t the Engli&s;h &s;ettlers, in revenge for &s;ome private injuries.&mdash; After Philip's death, in Augu&s;t 1676, numbers of tho&s;e Indians who were in confederacy with him, took refuge among the Indians of Penicook, who had continued peaceable during the war, and were on friendly terms with the people of Dover and other neighbouring &s;ettlements. Forces being &s;ent from Bo&s;ton to &s;earch for tho&s;e di&s;gui&s;ed enemies, and being arrived at Dover, where about four hundred Indians were peaceably a&s;&s;embled; by a &s;tratagem of Major Richard Waldron they &s;urrounded and &s;eized the whole body, without the lo&s;s of a life on either &s;ide (September 6); and the perfidious Indians being &s;eparated from the friendly, (who were di&s;mi&s;&s;ed) they were &s;ent to Bo&s;ton, to the number of about two hundred, a few were put to death and the re&s;t &s;old into &s;lavery abroad, of whom &s;ome found their way home. This action of the Major's was by the Indians deemed treachery and breach of friend&s;hip, and though they might have known he did it in con&s;equence of orders from the Government of the Ma&s;&s;a|chu&s;etts, under who&s;e juri&s;diction this province then was, yet according to their principles he de&s;erved &s;imilar treatment in revenge. But it was not till thirteen years after that matters were &s;ufficiently ripened to &s;trike the meditated blow. There had been then a renewal of friendly intercour&s;e between the Indians of Penicook and Saco and the Engli&s;h, which ren|dered the latter too &s;ecure, and gave the former an opportu|nity to execute their vindictive purpo&s;e more effectually.&mdash; On the evening of the 27th of June, 1689, &s;everal Squaws applied to each of the garri&s;oned hou&s;es at Cocheco for lodg|ing, and Me&s;andowit, Sachem of Pigwacket, was, as u&s;ual, kindly entertained by Major Waldron: By an unaccountable negligence, no watch was kept in the night, &s;o that the Squaws in the &s;everal garri&s;ons, and Me&s;andowit in the Ma|jor's, &s;ilently opened the gates and gave the &s;ignal by a whi&s;tle to their comrades, who were at hand, who ru&s;hed in and did their de&s;tructive work before the Engli&s;h could have time to repel them: They barbarou&s;ly murdered the old Major and <HI>twenty-two</HI> others, took <HI>twenty-nine,</HI> and having burned the be&s;t hou&s;es, drew off towards Canada, from whence they had been encouraged and &s;upplied.</P>
<P>Within a year after, viz. March 18, 1690, a body of In|dians and French fell &s;uddenly upon the inhabitants of Salmon-Falls, de&s;troying the be&s;t part of that plantation, about <HI>thirty</HI> per&s;ons were &s;lain and above <HI>fifty</HI> carried captive; the Engli&s;h boldly ventured in pur&s;uit of the enemy, and had a &s;kirmi&s;h, in which about four or five were killed on both &s;ides, but night put an end to the action.</P>
<P>The&s;e exploits not being &s;ufficient to glut the revenge of the Indians, who were now newly engaged in the French intere&s;t, they were &s;till determined on further mi&s;chief: After having made divers attacks upon the Ea&s;tern &s;ettlements, and being informed by their &s;pies of the defencele&s;s and &s;ecure &s;tate of the people at Oy&s;ter-River, they &s;uddenly fell upon them in the morning of the 18th of July, 1694, killing and captivating between <HI>ninety</HI> and an <HI>hundred</HI> per&s;ons, with the lo&s;s of only one Indian. There had been a peace made the year before at Pemaquid; but the Indians, like &s;ome of the polite&s;t nations in Europe, could keep their faith no longer than till they &s;aw a fit opportunity to break it.</P>

<P>We congratulate our&s;elves, <HI>May it plea&s;e your Excel|lency,</HI> on the happine&s;s we have hitherto enjoyed under your mild admini&s;tration: We behold with &s;atisfaction your endeavours to unite the true intere&s;t of our gra|cious Sovereign, and that of a free and loyal people, into one indivi&s;ible object: We rejoice to &s;ee this province, long &s;tinted in its growth, harra&s;&s;ed by repeated and cruel wars, expo&s;ed as the barrier again&s;t a mercile&s;s and &s;avage foe, now expanding and flouri&s;hing, under the au&s;picious patronage which your Excellency has afforded to our <HI>agriculture,</HI> and by the wi&s;e and gene|rous in&s;titution of a &s;eminary of <HI>learning:</HI> While the&s;e happy events di&s;tingui&s;h the annals of your admini&s;tra|tion, permit us al&s;o to hope, that the defence of this territory by a regular militia will employ your Excel|lency's

attention in proportion to your thorough know|ledge of the beneficial effects of a &s;imilar in&s;titution in our mother kingdom, and to your ardent zeal to pro|mote the true intere&s;t of this your native country.</P>
<P>May the Sovereign Ruler of the world incline the heart of our King &s;till to continue your Excellency a <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">ch and la&s;ting ble&s;&s;ing to this province: May the wi&s;dom which is from above direct and regulate your endeavours for the public good: And, may the &s;ancti|fying grace of God's holy &s;pirit &s;o influence your pub|lic &s;ervices, that they may not only promote our happi|ne&s;s, but may receive a gracious and eternal reward in a better world.</P>
<P>The Gentlemen who are commi&s;&s;ioned to the &s;everal <HI>Offices</HI> in this regiment will we hope di&s;tingui&s;h them|&s;elves, and do honour to their &s;tations by their diligent and united attention to the duty a&s;&s;igned them.&mdash; Gentlemen, the cau&s;e in which you are engaged is good; the fear of the God of armies, the love of your country, of its civil and religious Liberty, are noble principles to animate you; the&s;e will render the duty of furni&s;hing your own minds, and in&s;tructing your countrymen in the art of war, a plea&s;ing employment, and if you are ever called to action will &s;erve to alleviate the burdens of duty, and in&s;pire you with true courage and re&s;olu|tion. We tru&s;t, therefore, that the &s;ame generous and manly &s;pirit which you have already di&s;covered, will not &s;uffer you to be content with enjoying the honour of a title, but will make you &s;tudious to de&s;erve well of your country, &s;o that the re&s;pect &s;hewn you by others may be not merely the effect of complai&s;ance, but a ju&s;t tribute to your real merit.</P>
<P>No man I pre&s;ume will think it beneath him to be a <HI>Soldier,</HI> in defence of his family, his intere&s;t, his civil and religious liberty. My Brethren, many of you have in time pa&s;t girded on the harne&s;s, and proved

your&s;elves good &s;ervants of your King and country in the late wars; and tho&s;e of you who have not been in actual &s;ervice have the &s;ame natural intrepidity and alertne&s;s which are e&s;&s;ential qualifications of a good &s;oldier, and by which the men of the&s;e northern colo|nies have been always remarkably di&s;tingui&s;hed. You will not therefore need to be urged to a vigorous and graceful exertion of the&s;e gifts, in the military &s;ervice; you are not to be &s;ubject to the rigour and &s;everity of a &s;tanding army, but to that ea&s;y di&s;cipline which is &s;uffi|cient among neighbours united together for their own &s;afety; your officers are not a &s;et of &s;trangers, who might have ideas of rank &amp; &s;ubjection different from your&s;elves; but they are your friends and neighbours, who value your intere&s;t and reputation as dearly as their own, and would expo&s;e you to no difficulties but what they would cheer|fully endure them&s;elves: You know, that in all &s;ocie|ties there is a nece&s;&s;ity for order and &s;ubjection, or the valuable ends in view cannot be an&s;wered: As your duty is, therefore, &s;o ea&s;y, and will be but little interruption to your nece&s;&s;ary bu&s;ine&s;s; as the end of military know|ledge and &s;ervice is the good of the community, the defence and protection of your deare&s;t intere&s;ts; &s;o, we tru&s;t you will unanimou&s;ly and cheerfully addre&s;s your&s;elves to the duty, and render your&s;elves in this as well as other ways u&s;eful and ornamental members of &s;ociety.</P>
<P>To conclude, Let us <HI>all</HI> remember that though the knowledge and practice of military duty are &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to our defence and &s;ecurity as &s;ubjects of the kingdoms of this world; yet all the&s;e improvements are of a tem|poral nature, and the knowledge and utility of them will cea&s;e with our pre&s;ent form of exi&s;tence. Soon, very &s;oon &s;hall we get into the world of Spirits, where we &s;hall live and conver&s;e in a manner va&s;tly different from what we do here; and our eternal &s;tate will be

If we would then obtain the crown of immortal glory, we mu&s;t as good &s;oldiers of Je&s;us Chri&s;t fight <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> the banner of his cro&s;s again&s;t all the enemies of our &s;ouls: We mu&s;t look to the Great Captain of &s;alvation for &s;trength and a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and depend on his <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> and righteou&s;ne&s;s for the acceptance of our &s;er|vices and our reward: May he therefore enable us to be faithful unto death, and then give us a crown of life.</P>
