<HEAD>PREFACE</HEAD>
<P>IN penning the following memoirs, I had no other object in view than my own amu&s;ement. This con&s;i|deration may, perhaps, be accepted as an excu&s;e for the familiarity of my &s;tyle; which, as well as many other imperfections, will, no doubt, be perceived and condemned by the critic. The candid and indulgent reader, who reflects, that the piece was not till lately intended for the public eye&mdash;nor then, without the mo&s;t urgent &s;olicitations of a number of friends, will generou&s;ly pardon any defect he may di&s;cover in the peru&s;al. Having been intimately acquainted with the hero of the piece, in my juvenile days, I can with con|fidence vouch for the authenticity of the narrative. 'Tis true, I have introduced &s;ome per&s;ons and incidents which appear to be unconnected with the foundation of the &s;tory; yet, it will be found, that were any of the&s;e withdrawn, the chain of events would be broken, and the congruity of the piece de&s;troyed.&mdash;Upon the whole, if the &s;tyle is not florid, it will not wound the ear of mode&s;ty; if she &s;ubjects are not &s;ublime, they have a manife&s;t tendency to propagate &s;entiments of virtue&mdash;to &s;timulate youth to an humble re&s;ignation to the di&s;pen|&s;ations of providence&mdash;and to di&s;countenance vice.</P>
<P>At all events, I have ventured to lay it before the public, in hopes that, as a forlorn infant, it may find a fo&s;ter father, who will not &s;uffer it to &s;ink in oblivion.</P>

<HEAD>FORTUNE's FOOTBALL.</HEAD>
<P>BEFORE I enter into a detail of the adventures of our hero, I pre&s;ume it will not be unaccepta|ble to my readers, if not expedient, to give a cur&s;ory &s;ketch of his birth and education, in order to illu&s;trate the &s;ubject of the following &s;heets. This I &s;hall do in as conci&s;e a manner as po&s;&s;ible&mdash;well knowing that prolixity creates di&s;gu&s;t.</P>
<P>He was the fir&s;t and only &s;on of a gentleman in Lon|don, who enjoy'd an affluent and independent fortune &mdash;was noble, generous, humane and ho&s;pitable: His income not only &s;upported his family in &s;plendour, but al&s;o di&s;pen&s;ed its glad'ning &s;treams to the dreary abodes of pain and indigence. This gentleman, at a a &s;uitable age, with the approbation of his friends, paid his addre&s;&s;es to a young lady of a di&s;tingui&s;hed family, and great fortune&mdash;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of every accompli&s;hment to render a man of honour happy: To whom he was &s;hortly married. Before the anniver&s;ary of their nup|tials arrived, their happine&s;s was augmented by the birth of a &s;on, who, from that period, was the delight of every eye that &s;aw him, and in whom all the ri&s;ing hopes of his fond parents concentrated.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="031902_0004_0FEF3B88F4380EA8">This &s;on, is the per&s;on who&s;e &s;urprizing and varie|gated adventures I intend to di&s;clo&s;e&mdash;candidly tracing him through the various mazes and doublings of his peregrination:&mdash;He was called Mercutio.</P>
<P>There is a period between infancy and manhood, in which, let our &s;tation in life be what it may, nothing but trifles occur: I &s;hould hold my&s;elf inexcu&s;able in detaining the attention of my readers from the more in|tere&s;ting incident of my narrative, with an in&s;ipid rela|tion of tho&s;e; and therefore, &s;hall date the adventures of our hero from the commencement of his &s;ixteenth year. At that period, he became enamoured with a young lady, by an accident, which laid the foundation of his future fortunes and misfortunes, and of cour&s;e, this hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>He had ju&s;t completed his &s;tudies, at Oxford, when he attained his &s;ixteenth year: He therefore took leave of his teachers and fellow &s;tudents, and repaired to London. It would be needle&s;s to de&s;cribe the joyful emotions of his parents, on his arrival&mdash;Let it &s;uffice to &s;ay, that while the fond mother cla&s;p'd him with ardour to her bo&s;om, his father's heart expanded with parental pride, to &s;ee his &s;on&mdash;his only &s;on, in full po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of every nece&s;&s;ary accompli&s;hment&mdash;nature as well as art having largely contributed to render him complete.</P>
<P>His mother, li&s;ten'd with &s;upreme delight to the periods, which, with uncommon ea&s;e and propriety
<PB N="7" REF="031902_0005_0FEF3B785FD5E318">
he pronounced, while he de&s;cribed the progre&s;s he had made in his &s;tudies, and remark'd on the beauties and deformities of the &s;everal authors which had come un|der his particular ob&s;ervation&mdash;which he did with &s;o much judgment and candour, that envy her&s;elf could have made no exception&mdash;She revolved in her mind the many years of uninterrupted happine&s;s which it was probable he might enjoy&mdash;the many hours of heart-felt &s;atisfaction &s;he her&s;elf, as well as his happy father were yet likely to experience, not only in his company and conver&s;ation, but al&s;o in the plea&s;ing contemplation of his tran&s;mitting his name and virtues to millions yet unborn: But alas! the happine&s;s of mankind is fleet|ing and tran&s;itory&mdash;like fair weather in an April day, it is but of &s;hort duration; and though &s;o widely differ|ent, from di&s;appointment, pain and &s;lavery, in its nature and con&s;equences, is, neverthele&s;s, &s;o immedi|ately &s;ucceeded by them, as to appear, to human con|ception, to be of the &s;ame family.</P>
<P>This happy family lived within fifteen minutes' walk of Hyde-Park, and it being that delightful &s;ea&s;on of the year in which nature &s;eems to take a pride in di&s;playing her innumerable beauties&mdash;our hero frequently walk'd in the Park for recreation&mdash;&s;ometimes in company with his happy parents, and at others alone. As he delighted much in reading, he &s;eldom took an excur&s;ion alone without a book, in the peru&s;al of which he often &s;pent an hour or two&mdash;reclining beneath the friendly &s;hade of &s;ome one of tho&s;e venerable trees which adorn that
<PB N="8" REF="031902_0006_0FEF3B8ACE655550">
fine Park. One evening, while he was amu&s;ing him&s;elf in this manner, he was rou&s;ed by a &s;hriek of di&s;tre&s;s, which was uttered by a young lady, who, walking too near the &s;erpentine river, where the bank was very &s;teep, accidentally fell in&mdash;and the &s;tream running ra|pidly, wa&s;h'd her more than a hundred yards in a few &s;econds. Mercutio, being at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance from the bank of the river, exerted his utmo&s;t &s;peed, and perceiving the young lady ju&s;t above the water&mdash; he plunged in&mdash;caught her in his arms, and with much difficulty, bore her to the &s;hore, almo&s;t breathle&s;s. He was met at the bank of the river by two ladies, in tears, who prov'd to be the mother and &s;i&s;ter of her he had re&s;cued from a watery grave. They gave him what a&s;&s;i&s;tance they could, in conveying her to a convenient &s;ituation, then reque&s;ted him to &s;tep to the end of Pic|cadilly for an eminent phy&s;ician, who lived there. He ran immediately, leaving the young lady to the care of her mother and &s;i&s;ter, and in a few words communicat|ed his bu&s;ine&s;s to the &s;urgeon: who in&s;tantly accom|panied him to the &s;pot. The young lady, notwith|&s;tanding the endeavours of her mother and &s;i&s;ter, was to all appearance dead. The tender parent was hardly kept from fainting, while the &s;urviving daughter wept immoderately&mdash;&s;o that the whole exhibited a &s;cene of real di&s;tre&s;s. While the &s;urgeon exerted his abilities to recover the almo&s;t drowned lady, it required all the philo&s;ophy as well as rhetoric of Mercutio, to keep the other two in any tolerable degree of &s;pirits;&mdash;however it plea&s;ed God to crown the endeavours of the &s;urgeon
<PB N="9" REF="031902_0007_0FEF3B7C1473FA28">
with unexpected &s;ucce&s;s:&mdash;Cheerfulne&s;s diffu&s;ed it&s;elf in&s;tantly over every countenance, when her re&s;u&s;cita|tion was announced&mdash;they &s;urrounded her with an eagerne&s;s which plainly indicated their late apprehen|&s;ions, and pre&s;ent &s;atisfaction. Our hero was not the la&s;t in congratulating her on her recovery; but the joy of her mother and &s;i&s;ter, is ea&s;ier imagined than de&s;cribed. She, with a heavy &s;igh, opened her eyes, which, even in that impair'd &s;tate, were equal in lu&s;tre to the dia|mond of the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite poli&s;h, and looking around her, eagerly &s;aid, where is my mama?&mdash;Where is Charlotte?&mdash;Here we are, replied the mother and &s;i&s;ter together. Be compo&s;ed, my dear, &s;aid the old lady&mdash;Heaven his interpo&s;ed in our favour, and all will be well. Madam, interrupted the &s;urgeon, my advice is to convey your daughter home as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible&mdash;let her be put in a warm bed, and do not di&s;turb her to night&mdash;give me your addre&s;s, and I will vi&s;it her early in the morning, and pre&s;cribe &s;uch things as I &s;hall then judge &s;alutary. The old lady re|turned her thanks for his care, and informed him that &s;he lived on the &s;outh &s;ide of Cavendi&s;h-Square. The patient was then placed between her mother and &s;i&s;ter, in the doctor's chariot, which had brought him and Mercutio, who having promi&s;ed, at the in&s;tance of the old lady, to accompany the &s;urgeon the next day, took leave and departed.</P>
<P>Although the foregoing accident and adventure, does not appear to have been calculated for the foundation
<PB N="10" REF="031902_0008_0FEF3B8D814A6DD8">
of an amour; yet this was ab&s;olutely the ca&s;e: For no &s;ooner did Lucinda, (the young lady) expand her beauteous eyes, than love, like the electrical fire, diffus'd it&s;elf through each avenue of our hero's heart, which being tender and &s;u&s;ceptible, retained this fir&s;t impre&s;|&s;ion &s;o firmly, that it was never eradicated, until the lovely orbs, by which it was communicated, were quench'd in death.</P>
<P>Mercutio's mind had never been agitated before, in the &s;ame manner, as it was that evening, and the en&s;u|ing night. He &s;lept little&mdash;broken &s;lumbers, and con|fus'd ideas, tortur'd his imagination, till the return of the day. The image of Lucinda appear'd to his ima|gination in various forms: At one time, he beheld her pale and lifele&s;s on the bank of the river&mdash;at another, faintly &s;truggling with the impetuous &s;tream&mdash;and &s;ome|times as a bride, adorned for the nuptial ceremony, in all the bloom of youth, beauty and native innocence.</P>
<P>Having breakfa&s;ted, he ha&s;tened to the hou&s;e of the &s;urgeon, and with him, for the fir&s;t time, rode to Ca|vendi&s;h-Square, where he was received with all that politene&s;s peculiar to per&s;ons of exalted rank and refin|ed education. Lucinda, after a comfortable night's re&s;t, aro&s;e, invigorated and cheerful, and having been informed by her mama, of the particulars of what &s;he had &s;u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ere<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the prece<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing evening, and of her miracu|lous pre&s;ervation&mdash;&s;he was ju&s;t expre&s;&s;ing her de&s;ire to &s;ee and thank her deliverer, when the &s;ervant announc'd
<PB N="11" REF="031902_0009_0FEF3B9184B89E40">
the arrival of the phy&s;ician and another gentleman. Lucinda's matchle&s;s charms blazed forth in their native &s;plendor&mdash;and, her natural vivacity having re&s;umed its feat, her di&s;cour&s;e con&s;iderably encrea&s;ed the &s;atisfaction of the company. The old lady, acknowledged the pre&s;ervation of her daughter's life, in the mo&s;t grateful terms, and added, that &s;he knew Lord S&mdash;r, her hu&s;band, would never forget the obligation. Though our hero was fully recompen&s;ed for the &s;ervice he had rendered the daughter of Lord S&mdash;r, with a con|&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of having been in&s;trumental in &s;aving &s;uch a compo&s;ition of wit and beauty from the mercile&s;s jaws of death; yet his &s;atisfaction was con&s;iderably augmented, by the acknowledgments of Lucinda her|&s;elf, which &s;he expre&s;&s;ed in the following manner: Words, &s;ir, are too weak, to de&s;cribe my grateful &s;en&s;i|bility of the va&s;t obligation, under which, my mama informs me, you have laid me, by your humane exer|tions in &s;aving me from impending danger; but as the only return in my power at pre&s;ent, is a grateful re|membrance of the favour, I hope that may be accepted in part, and I promi&s;e to make up the deficiency, by ever e&s;teeming you as the generous pre&s;erver of my life.</P>
<P>Madam, &s;aid he, the reward you have promi&s;ed, and which I accept with joy, and &s;hall ever &s;trive to de&s;erve, is more than an equivalent to any &s;ervice I could po&s;&s;ibly render; but you mu&s;t not &s;uppo&s;e your&s;elf under any obligation to me; for a gentleman who could have done le&s;s, on a &s;imilar occa&s;ion, mu&s;t have dive&s;t|ed
<PB N="12" REF="031902_0010_0FEF3B66B7ECC9A8">
him&s;elf of every particle of humanity, as well as violated its common laws.</P>
<P>The &s;urgeon finding his fair patient in perfect health, and being &s;atisfied for his trouble, departed. Mercutio was more than once prevented from taking his leave, by the joint &s;olicitations of the ladies, who ardently reque&s;ted the favour of his company till evening, to which he very willingly complied.</P>
<P>Dinner being over, the ladies played a duetto on the harp&s;ichord, accompanied with their voices: The ma&s;|terly &s;kill with which they performed, and the enchant|ing harmony produced from the lips and fingers of the&s;e lovely girls, increa&s;ed the infant pa&s;&s;ion of Mercu|tio to a degree of ardor not often exceeded. He li&s;tened with rapture, and gazed with &s;ilent a&s;toni&s;hment! He had never fea&s;ted his eyes and ears &s;o &s;umptuou&s;ly be|fore. The evening approaching, he took leave, having previou&s;ly, in compliance with reiterated reque&s;ts, promi&s;ed to renew his vi&s;it &s;hortly, which he did not fail punctually to ob&s;erve, as will appear in the &s;equel.</P>
<P>As the accident which gave ri&s;e to our hero's ac|quaintance with this family, proved to be the &s;ource of tho&s;e &s;urprizing adventures of which the en&s;uing part of this hi&s;tory is compo&s;ed, I pre&s;ume it will not be accounted a digre&s;&s;ion, to pre&s;ent the reader with a very brief account of the eminent per&s;onages, who gave birth to the empre&s;s of his affections.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="031902_0011_0FEF3B942F9EC008">The father of Lucinda was the elde&s;t &s;on of the duke of N&mdash;, who&s;e great abilities, as well in the field as cabinet, are too well known to need a repetition in this place: The &s;on po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed not only the e&s;tate of his fa|ther, but al&s;o his virtues and bravery. At a &s;uitable age, without having run through tho&s;e &s;cenes of vice and di&s;&s;ipation, which are too frequently and fatally the principal objects which our young noblemen pur&s;ue, he fixed his affections on an amiable young lady, daughter of Lord H&mdash;n. They lived, as might be expect|ed, in all that harmony which never fails a virtuous union, founded on mutual e&s;teem. The fir&s;t fruit of their connubial love was a daughter, which was the &s;ame who had captivated the affections of Mercutio. She had received an education &s;uitable to her birth and fortune, which &s;he improved by every means po&s;&s;ible. The &s;econd child was a &s;on, and called Charles, an amiable youth, then in Naples: He had been taken dangerou&s;ly ill in that city, and his companion and tutor having written to his father, to inform him of the &s;ituation of his &s;on, he had embarked, accompani|ed by a very able phy&s;ician, for Italy.&mdash;But to return:&mdash;</P>
<P>Mercutio's attention was totally diverted from its u&s;ual channel: 'twas entirely ab&s;orbed in the contem|plation of the charming qualifications of Lucinda, and in revolving the happy con&s;equences that would infalli|bly attend an honorable union with her&mdash;and began &s;eriou&s;ly to re&s;olve on matrimony, if the con&s;ent of all
<PB N="14" REF="031902_0012_0FEF3B96E214A7B8">
parties could be obtained: Of this, however, he had many doubts and fears; having frequently heard his father reprobate the cu&s;tom of marrying at too early a period, and being &s;o young, he imagined would be an in&s;urmountable ob&s;tacle in procuring his con&s;ent, which he conceived as ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to his future hap|pine&s;s.</P>
<P>Lucinda's gratitude was, at the fir&s;t interview, by an ea&s;y tran&s;ition, converted to genuine friend&s;hip: It is no wonder, then, if the exact and manly features, &s;ym|metry of &s;hape, engaging deportment, and natural viva|city of Mercutio, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by &s;o powerful an ally as the mo&s;t uncontaminated e&s;teem, &s;hould have made an indelible impre&s;&s;ion on &s;uch a heart as her's&mdash;&s;u&s;ceptible of the &s;lighte&s;t. This was the ca&s;e&mdash;but each was ignorant of the attachment of the other, and bore hard on the feelings of both; for it would have afforded great con&s;olation to them, to have known the real &s;ituation of each other's heart.</P>
<P>Mercutio re&s;olved to love&mdash;he relinqui&s;hed all his former diver&s;ions: The park, the ball, the opera and play, had no charms for him! he devoted him&s;elf to &s;olitude while at home&mdash;and &s;eldom went abroad but to Lord S&mdash;'s.</P>
<P>It was at one of tho&s;e vi&s;its he had the honour of his fir&s;t interview with the father and brother of his beloved Lucinda. They had arrived from Italy the day before,
<PB N="15" REF="031902_0013_0FEF3B99A97E6408">
both in health and vigour. On entering the room, Lu|cinda with a charming grace, taking his hand, pre&s;ented him to her father, &s;aying, This, papa, is the gentleman (with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of heaven) to whom I owe this my &s;econd exi&s;tence. He aro&s;e in&s;tantly, and enclo&s;ing him in his arms, &s;aid, Sir, you have bound, by your genero&s;ity, me, and every branch of my family, by the mo&s;t la&s;ting ties, tho&s;e of friend&s;hip&mdash;let this day be the epocha of our invariable attachment. My dear Charles, &s;aid he to his &s;on, from this day forward, con&s;ider this our worthy friend as a brother&mdash;a beloved and truly meritorious brother. So &s;aying, he joined the hands of the two young men, who &s;aluted each other with ardor. Mercutio congratulated his newly adopted brother, on his recovery and return to England; and he, in return, a&s;&s;ured him of his un&s;haken gratitude and affection. They then entered into unre&s;trained conver&s;ation, in the cour&s;e of which Mercutio's anxiety for&s;ook him&mdash;he di&s;cour&s;ed with his u&s;ual vivacity and good &s;en&s;e, and by his judicious rea&s;oning and remarks, prov'd him&s;elf the fini&s;hed gentleman. Charles was enraptured with his di&s;cour&s;e, and earne&s;tly wi&s;hed to cultivate an acquaintance with one, who&s;e &s;entiments appeared congenial with his own, and who had already engro&s;&s;ed a large portion of his e&s;teem.</P>
<P>In the afternoon, they took an excur&s;ion in Hyde-Park, and coming to the &s;pot where Lucinda had &s;lip|ped into the river, the gratitude of the whole family was again called into action: They reiterated their former
<PB N="16" REF="031902_0014_0FEF3B436EDB3958">
acknowledgments, &s;o that Mercutio, overwhelmed with a &s;en&s;e of their genero&s;ity, entreated them to de&s;i&s;t, add|ing, that the favours he had received that day, were &s;ufficient to preponderate all he had done, or ever &s;hould be able to do, though his whole future life &s;hould be devoted to their &s;ervice. This turned the di&s;cour&s;e in another channel&mdash;for, as the whole family entertained &s;entiments of the highe&s;t e&s;teem for him, they forebore &s;peaking on a &s;ubject which they found gave him pain, though they conceived them&s;elves &s;o highly obliged, that they held them&s;elves in&s;olvent.</P>
<P>Before they parted, Charles begged the favour of Mercutio's company to Hampton court, on that day week, adding, he had been &s;o long abroad that he had almo&s;t forgot the beautiful retreats of his own country. Mercutio promi&s;ed to wait on him at the time appoint|ed, and taking leave of the whole family, departed.&mdash; His father, having &s;ome affairs to tran&s;act at Bri&s;tol, &s;et out the next morning for that place, while his &s;on formed the re&s;olution to di&s;clo&s;e his love for Lucinda to his mother, before his father's return: Rightly judg|ing, that if &s;he approved, it would not be a very ar|duous ta&s;k to procure his approbation al&s;o. In con&s;e|quence of this re&s;olution, one evening, being engaged in &s;erious conver&s;ation with her, he introduced the important &s;ecret that engro&s;&s;ed all his thoughts&mdash;and cau&s;ed him &s;o much anxiety, and which he had never communicated to any one before. It happened that his mother was not altogether unacquainted with the
<PB N="17" REF="031902_0015_0FEF3B9B61507140">
family to which &s;he found her &s;on &s;o firmly attached, and had he been of riper years, would not have with|held her approbation a moment; but knowing her hu&s;|band's tenacity in that point, &s;he forebore giving a po&s;itive an&s;wer, for the pre&s;ent; promi&s;ing, however, to do every thing in her power, to intere&s;t his father in his behalf.</P>
<P>This, though in&s;ufficient immediately to obliterate every doubt, was a cordial to the mind of Mercutio: He, from that evening became cheerful, and before the day arriv'd on which he had con&s;ented to ride to Hampton, he enjoyed the mo&s;t perfect tranquillity of mind, and re&s;olved to acquaint his friend Charles, with the pa&s;&s;ion he had conceived for his elde&s;t &s;i&s;ter, but previou&s;ly to enjoin him to &s;ecrecy, if he &s;hould di&s;approve of it. Having &s;ettled the&s;e things in his mind, he met his friend Charles at the appointed time and place. It was a fine day, and Charles entertained him with the many rarities and diver&s;ions of Italy, which afforded Mercutio much &s;atisfaction. They arrived at Hampton about noon, and having refre&s;hed, ordered dinner to be ready at three, and then went to regale them&s;elves with the beauties of the elegant gar|dens which pertain to the palace.</P>

After &s;ome preparatory conver&s;ation, Mercutio, in a few words, and in a very diffident &s;tyle, informed Charles of his violent pa&s;&s;ion for Lucinda, and reque&s;ted him to give his opinion and advice on the &s;ubject, as it was a very important one to him. My dear friend, &s;aid Charles, it gives me infinite plea&s;ure, that the per&s;om whom I &s;o much e&s;teem, has honoured me with his confidence in a matter &s;o weighty and intere&s;ting, and mu&s;t freely confe&s;s, that it is no more than I &s;u&s;pected.

She was interred in the family vault in St. James's church, on the very day her hand was to have been joined to Mercutio's, who followed her remains, array'd in &s;olemn black, which but faintly expre&s;&s;ed the gloomy &s;ituation of his mind.</P>
<P>Having a&s;&s;i&s;ted at tho&s;e rites, which forever &s;eparated him from that trea&s;ure, which but a few days before, not all the riches of the ea&s;t would have purcha&s;ed, he betook him&s;elf to the mo&s;t profound &s;olitude&mdash;kept no company&mdash;never went abroad, except to &s;pend a lone|&s;ome hour in St. James church. One morning early,

when he repaired to that owful receptacle, and having walked backward and forward for &s;ome time, with his arms folded together, &s;uppo&s;ing him&s;elf alone, broke out into the following pa&s;&s;ionate exclamations: Oh! my tortured bo&s;om!&mdash;Where &s;hall my &s;oul find peace? Alas, there is none for me on this &s;ide eternity&mdash;no, no, the marble jaws of death hath &s;eparated, finally &s;eparated me from all the world contained to render me happy! I &s;hall never more behold tho&s;e ravi&s;hing fea|tures which once tran&s;ported my devoted &s;oul&mdash;where blooming innocence and inimitable beauty contended for pre-eminence&mdash;&s;hall never li&s;ten to tho&s;e joy-in&s;pir|ing accents, which has &s;o frequently fill'd my &s;oul with plea&s;ure un&s;peakable! But though the cruel tyrant has &s;eparated our bodies, our &s;ouls can never be divided&mdash; that tie is too &s;trong&mdash;it cannot&mdash;&s;hall not be broken. Here, Charles, who had arrived at the mournful &s;pot before Mercutio, and had heard the foregoing, di&s;co|vered him&s;elf. Though the time, place and other cir|cum&s;tances, had a palpable tendency to render &s;olitude more &s;olitary; yet it was a matter of con&s;olation to tho&s;e young friends to meet, even on &s;o mournful an occa&s;ion: For though it was impo&s;&s;ible for one to re|move the melancholy from the other, yet by interming|ling their griefs, they were enabled to &s;upport the enor|mous load more patiently, than they could have done &s;eparately. After di&s;cour&s;ing &s;ome time on the &s;hortne&s;s and po&s;itive certainty of the extinction, &s;ooner or later, of human life, as well as the innumerable avenues lead|ing to the gloomy man&s;ions of death, that are con&s;tantly

In this frame of mind, Mercutio reque&s;ted Charles to &s;pend the day with him. Taking leave of that awful rece&s;s, they dropt a tributary tear and departed. They &s;pent the day in a manner corre|&s;ponding with that in which they had began it, taking to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance HERVEY and SHERLOCK, who&s;e inimitable works made no &s;mall addition to that cheer|ful re&s;ignation with which their morning di&s;cour&s;e had in&s;pired them.</P>

propo&s;ed it to them&mdash;they freely a&s;&s;ented, in hopes that a diver&s;ity of climate, and the innumerable objects, both natural and artificial, to be met with in making the tour of Europe, might have a happy effect in re|viving tho&s;e animated marks of a cheerful heart and vigorous body, which had ever been the leading features in his countenance, until impaired by grief and di&s;ap|pointment.</P>
<P>Preparations were made for his intended voyage: He vi&s;ited the parents of the much lamented Lucinda. But, it would require &s;ome of the fine&s;t &s;trokes and &s;tronge&s;t colouring that ever proceeded from the pen of the immortal Raphael, to paint the emotions of the whole family, when the moment of &s;eparation arrived. Not an eye pre&s;ent but &s;hed the tear of real affection! Not a heart but palpitated, in perfect uni&s;on, with the &s;oul-dividing pangs of &s;eparation. Lord S&mdash; and his amiable con&s;ort, cla&s;p'd their departing friend to their noble brea&s;ts, in all the extacy of parental love. Adieu! my dear &s;on they exclaimed together. Adieu! my beloved friend and brother, repeated Charles and Charlotte&mdash;It was too much for human nature to bear&mdash;The organs of &s;peech were mutually arre&s;ted &mdash;tears &s;upplied the place of words. He &s;ilently and &s;peedily withdrew, while his agitated limbs were yet capable of &s;upporting him out.</P>
<P>After taking an affectionate leave of his parents, he &s;et out po&s;t for Dover, and embarked on board a packet
<PB N="35" REF="031902_0033_0FEF3B5FF2BA2CF0">
at that place, attended by two tru&s;ty dome&s;tics, who had been many years in the family, and arrived at Calais the &s;ame evening. It is more than probable, that if Mercutio, or his friends, had barely conceived the danger, difficulties, hard&s;hips and &s;lavery, he had to encounter, before they were to meet again, they would have guarded again&s;t &s;o fatal an event with all their powers; but it is more wi&s;ely order'd: man is not permitted to penetrate the unfathomable depths of futurity: he is allow'd a faint glimp&s;e of the pre&s;ent: and, while he retains his faculties, he may, by retro|&s;pection, take an imperfect, ideal view, of &s;uch of the pa&s;t as has been &s;trongly marked, and con&s;equently made a more la&s;ting impre&s;&s;ion than generally attend the common occurrences of life; but the incidents and objects of futurity are concealed behind an impenetra|ble cloud, until the uncea&s;ing, undeviating order of nature, &s;hall unfold them, individually, in the order in which they may then lie.</P>
<P>He made no &s;tay in Calais, but proceeded to Paris. As he had not much reli&s;h for cover&s;ation, he intended, while he re&s;ided in Paris, to act the part of a &s;pectator only: Of cour&s;e, he took lodgings at a private hou&s;e, in a plea&s;ant &s;ituation, where he could enjoy the cool air, undi&s;turb'd by the rattling of chariots, and the vain pomp of Pari&s;ian grandeur. He attended all pub|lic places of recreation, but carefully avoided culti|vating an intimacy with any per&s;on. He wrote to his father and other friends, by every po&s;t: This, and

the peru&s;al of the &s;everal epi&s;tles from them, (not one of whom neglected to an&s;wer punctually every one of his) employed mo&s;t of his lei&s;ure time, and afforded him much of that kind of plea&s;ure, in which he then mo&s;t delighted.</P>
<P>Being pre&s;ent at an auction of pictures, one day, where &s;everal per&s;ons of di&s;tinction were a&s;&s;embled, his eyes involuntarily caught a face which &s;eem'd familiar to him: He fixed his attention on the object, and after con&s;idering him for &s;ome minutes, found it to be his old acquaintance and fellow-&s;tudent, George Wright. Mercutio was a good deal &s;urprized at &s;eeing him in that place, and &s;o richly dre&s;&s;ed (it being an elegant &s;uit, fa&s;hioned in the Pari&s;ian ta&s;te, and richly embroi|dered) in &s;o &s;hort a time after the &s;ingular affair before recited. He found means to di&s;cover him&s;elf to his friend, who, when he recognized him, gave a &s;ignal to follow, and immediately left the room. When they had got into the &s;treet, Georg, in a very affectio|nate manner, took Mercutio by the hand, &s;aying, I have joyful news to communicate to you, my dear friend; but we will &s;tep into a hotel, where we can di&s;cour&s;e in private, and with freedom. There being one within a few &s;teps, they entered, when George called for a private room and a bottle of Burgundy. I make no doubt, &s;aid George, but you are a&s;toni&s;hed at the alte|ration you perceive in me&mdash;but bani&s;h your &s;urprize: The dear girl, of whom I told you the la&s;t time I had the happine&s;s of &s;eeing you in England, and whom I

con&s;idered as irrecoverably lo&s;t to me, is now in Paris, and mine by every law, human and divine, and death alone can &s;eparate us. Why, you have been very for|tunate indeed, replied Mercutio. Fortunate! Yes, my friend, my good fortune has exceeded my mo&s;t &s;anguine expectations; and, be a&s;&s;ured, my heart vibrates with gratitude to heaven, and you, the happy in&s;trument of my &s;alvation from eternal infamy and de&s;pair! Mercu|tio expre&s;&s;ing a wi&s;h to be informed of the particulars of this apparently unaccountable revolution, George proceeded to gratify it. After I parted with you and your friend at Hyde-Park wall, I went to a friend in whom I could confide, and related my &s;tory in a few words, concealing only the re&s;olution I had taken in con&s;equence of my father's barbarity, and reque&s;ted his advice and a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Why, &s;aid he, it's a critical affair &mdash;I'm at a lo&s;s how to advi&s;e&mdash;After a &s;hort pau&s;e&mdash; George, &s;aid he, I'll tell you what&mdash;I will go in the morning to your father, and, without taking any no|tice of having &s;een you, as I am &s;omething in his debt, &s;ettle and pay him off: Then, as he will be obliged to examine the account him&s;elf, I &s;hall have a fair oppor|tunity to enquire for you, if he does not &s;tart it him&s;elf. This will naturally (as you know our intimacy) bring out the whole tran&s;action, in which I &s;hall be able to di&s;cover how the old man &s;tands affected towards you. If I find him relenting, I will immediately pre&s;s him to a reconciliation&mdash;if not, I &s;hall be &s;ilent on the &s;ubject: This is all in my power to do, in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of affairs. In the morning he &s;et out&mdash;and it is hard to

At length he returned&mdash;and, to my extreme amazement, announced the in&s;tantaneous death of my father! And though it might be &s;uppo&s;ed, after expe|riencing &s;uch cruel treatment, I &s;hould receive the news of his decea&s;e with a degree of &s;atisfaction, rather than regret:&mdash;But I do a&s;&s;ure you, this was not the ca&s;e&mdash; I &s;tood a&s;toni&s;hed for &s;ome time, and know not how long I &s;hould have remained &s;o, had not my friend rouzed me from my reverie, by telling me, my pre&s;ence was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary at home, as my father was a widower, and having no child but me, the af<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">airs of the family would otherwi&s;e &s;oon fall into a di&s;tracted &s;tate. Be&s;ides, what would the world &s;ay, if you &s;hould &s;o far neglect your duty, as not to provide for and &s;uperintend your father's funeral?&mdash;Although I was fully &s;en&s;ible of the ju&s;tice and propriety of the&s;e hints&mdash;yet I was &s;o wrapt in the contemplation of the &s;udden &s;troke which had reduced my father to a &s;tate of inanimation, that I had forgot every thing el&s;e. However, not to detain you, I repaired home, where I no &s;ooner perceived him from whom I derived my exi&s;tence, lying pale and breathle&s;s, than, impelled by filial love and duty, I fell on the venerable corp&s;e, and bathed it with tears&mdash; lamenting, in the mo&s;t &s;incere and pathetic terms, his premature death, which was occa&s;ioned by a fit of apoplexy. To be brief&mdash;in one month after the funeral ob&s;equies were performed, in con&s;equence of a letter
<PB N="39" REF="031902_0037_0FEF3BC8C030DFB8">
from my uncle in Venice, reque&s;ting me to go thither, I applied my&s;elf to the &s;ettling my affairs, which to me who had managed my father's bu&s;ine&s;s &s;o long, was an ea&s;y matter.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, after &s;ettling and paying every legal demand, I found my&s;elf worth at lea&s;t forty thou&s;and pounds. Among a number of bonds, which I di&s;cover|ed in a little box in my father's &s;crutoire, one for five and twenty hundred pounds, on the father of my dear Amelia pre&s;ented it&s;elf. I wrote to him without de|lay, informing him of my intended voyage to Venice, and reque&s;ting immediate payment. The next day, I received an an&s;wer to my billet, full of con&s;olatory lan|guage, expre&s;&s;ing much &s;orrow for the lo&s;s I had &s;u&s;|tained in &s;o good a father&mdash;reque&s;ting the favour of a vi&s;it, and added, that he could not reimbur&s;e the whole &s;um for a few weeks, owing to &s;ome heavy lo&s;&s;es he had met with in the public funds, &amp;c.</P>
<P>As I wi&s;hed for nothing on earth &s;o much as one more interview with his daughter, if yet unmarried, &s;hould it even be the la&s;t&mdash;a gleam of hope darted thro' my &s;oul, and &s;ugge&s;ted the idea, that if &s;he was yet &s;ingle, I might one day be &s;o happy as to call her mine.</P>
<P>I waited on the old man in a few days. He received me with much apparent kindne&s;s, and to my inexpre&s;&s;i|ble joy, introduced me to his daughter, as beautiful, and as much at liberty as when I la&s;t parted with her&mdash;
<PB N="40" REF="031902_0038_0FEF3B37F29883C0">
though her father had employed the mo&s;t rigorous means to force her to wed the avaricious, &s;uperannuated I&s;raelite&mdash;yet it was all to no purpo&s;e&mdash;the lovely girl remained inflexible; &s;he cho&s;e rather to endure confinement, nay, even death it&s;elf, than &s;ubmit to be joined to a wretch of that de&s;cription. In the cour&s;e of our conver&s;ation, I gave him to under&s;tand, that I &s;hould have immediate occa&s;ion for the money, as I intended to embark for Venice in a few days, having &s;ettled all my affairs, and that a failure would be de|trimental, and perhaps productive of di&s;agreeable con|&s;equences. He told me, he would endeavour to fur|ni&s;h it within three weeks, and concluded with a reque&s;t, that I would not pa&s;s his door as a &s;tranger, in the mean time; for as he ever had a great veneration for my decea&s;ed father, he &s;hould think it an honour to be ranked among the friends of his &s;on.</P>
<P>It was ea&s;y to perceive the old fellow's drift. He was well acquainted with my father's circum&s;tances, and al&s;o, that I was &s;ole heir; therefore, he conceived if he could ingratiate him&s;elf with me, I would not only marry his daughter without a portion, but al&s;o relea&s;e him from the payment of the bond, in which he was not altogether mi&s;taken; for finding her attachment as &s;trong as ever, I was determined to renew my vi&s;it &s;hortly, and demand her of her father in marriage, and if granted, I was re&s;olved to have celebrated as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, without regard to the motives or conditions of his con&s;ent. In &s;hort, at the very next vi&s;it I declared

my&s;elf to him. He con&s;ented without he&s;itation, and in ten days more, heaven conferred on me the greate&s;t ble&s;&s;ing&mdash;my every wi&s;h. We were married, and the &s;ame day I re&s;igned the bond into his own hands, with|out any con&s;ideration, which plea&s;ed him exceedingly. George, &s;aid he, you have been a dutiful &s;on to your de|cea&s;ed father, and for that rea&s;on I have given you my only child, and though I have given her nothing on the day of her marriage, all I have will fall to you both when I die, and perhaps I &s;hall make as great an addi|tion to my pre&s;ent &s;tock, as you could po&s;&s;ibly, if you had it in your own hands.</P>
<P>I immediately made the nece&s;&s;ary preparations for my intended voyage. Having never been in France, I re&s;olved, in order to &s;how my dear Amelia the manners of the Pari&s;ians, as well as gratify my own curio&s;ity, to take it in my tour: We have been here a month, and expect to &s;ail for Italy in a few days.&mdash;This is all I have to communicate at pre&s;ent. Now, I wi&s;h you to accompany me to my lodgings, where, as long as we remain in Paris, you &s;hall be a welcome gue&s;t. Mercutio con&s;ented, and on the way informed George of his own &s;ad di&s;a&s;ter, and of the re&s;olution he had taken in con&s;equence. George &s;ympathized with him in his misfortunes; but at the &s;ame time, begged him to be con&s;oled: for, it argues a debility of mind, to faint under the di&s;pen&s;ations of providence;&mdash;true fortitude, you have taught me, con&s;i&s;ts in a virtuous and cheer|ful re&s;ignation: It is to your animating and well-timed

<P>Having di&s;patched a letter home to adverti&s;e his friends of his intention, he embarked on board an Italian &s;hip, bound to Rome, whither they had a &s;hort and plea&s;ant pa&s;&s;age. After &s;taying three days in that once fam'd capital, to refre&s;h, they &s;et out by land for Ancona, from whence they &s;ailed in a &s;mall ve&s;&s;el for Venice. On their arrival, they &s;ound George's uncle in good health, who received Mercutio with the greate&s;t politene&s;s imaginable. He was at fir&s;t, overjoyed to &s;ee his nephew; but his tran&s;port was much abated, when he was informe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of the &s;udden death of his brother.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="031902_0041_0FEF3B6B5103F118">Mercutio, at the earne&s;t reque&s;t of the whole family, took up his abode with them during his &s;tay at Venice.

<P>HAVING been &s;o happy as to be honored with your hand this evening, I have, for a peculiar rea&s;on, a &s;trong de&s;ire to have a &s;hort interview in private, as I have a matter of great importance to communicate to you. If this meets your approbation, you will attend ve&s;pers to-morrow evening, at the chapel of St. Aloy&s;ius, where the per&s;on who delivers this will attend, to conduct you to a proper place for that pur|po&s;e&mdash;if not, de&s;troy this, and quit Venice &s;peedily&mdash; Perhaps you may find no rea&s;on to repent a compliance.</P>
<P>Mercutio having got home, examined the billet, and peru&s;ed it attentively &s;everal times over, ju&s;tly conclud|ed it mu&s;t be the lady with whom he danced, that had honored him with this &s;ingular epi&s;tle. The next morn|ing he &s;howed the billet to George, and reque&s;ted his advice, adding, he would fain meet the author, if he thought he might do it with &s;afety. Why, replied he, I don't imagine you have any cau&s;e to apprehend dan|ger in meeting her; but a refu&s;al, it appears to me, if you remain here, may be attended with di&s;agreeable con&s;equences.

which are commonly imaginary. How re|markably kind and indulgent is Providence in ca&s;es of this nature: For when the mind has experienced any uncommon &s;hock, there is always a counterpoi&s;e placed within reach, &s;ufficient to prevent the dreadful effects of a mind &s;urcharged with grief. This was exemplified in the ca&s;e before us: For had Mercutio remained at home, a variety of objects would frequently have awak|ened the remembrance of Lucinda, and kept his mind in a continual &s;tate of dreary &s;olitude, if not ab&s;olute de&s;pair. But by a my&s;terious concatenation of events, we behold him rein&s;tated in his former vigour and gaiety &mdash;involuntarily engaged in an amour, which, though apparently criminal, is not ab&s;olutely &s;o; for his in|tention was to repair the error he had been &s;uddenly betrayed into, by an honorable marriage, as &s;oon as a convenient opportunity &s;hould pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>The female confidante, before the dawning of the day, gave Mercutio notice it was time to decamp. Though this was an unwelcome piece of intelligence, yet a compliance being ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, they part|ed, with reluctance, Leonora having previou&s;ly pre&s;&s;ed a very valuable ring on the finger of Mercutio, which &s;he reque&s;ted him to wear in te&s;timony of her unalter|able attachment.</P>
<P>Having propo&s;ed to renew his vi&s;it, on an appointed evening, his female conductre&s;s e&s;corted him to the &s;pot where &s;he had met him the evening before, and on the

way, laid down a very judicious and well-con&s;tructed plan for their future operations, and withal, pointing out the mo&s;t infallible marks whereby he might find the wicket without difficulty or danger of being di&s;covered. Having rewarded her hone&s;ty with a few pieces, he repaired to his lodgings, ju&s;t as the dawn of day began to appear, and went immediately to bed, where the &s;oft balm of &s;leep locked up his faculties, while his counte|nance exhibited a type of death&mdash;his imagination be|ing &s;teadily fixed on the object of his love.</P>
<P>About noon, his friend George waited on him, to whom Mercutio made known every particular of his nocturnal adventure&mdash;But pray inform me, &s;aid he, if &s;o much may tran&s;pire, in what part of Venice does your fair enamoretto dwell? Indeed, replied Mercutio, I am not able to &s;olve that que&s;tion, though I am of opinion, I could find the hou&s;e; but the way to and from it is &s;o intricate, that it would be next to an im|po&s;&s;ibility for me to point out the particular &s;pot, until I make a further di&s;covery, which I am determined to attempt this day. But, my dear George, I mu&s;t re|que&s;t you to keep this matter a profound &s;ecret, becau&s;e I have very cogent rea&s;ons to &s;u&s;pect that the young lady is of an exalted rank, and if the affair &s;hould inad|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ertently be developed, di&s;agreeable con&s;equences might en&s;ue. Pardon me for giving you this (perhaps need|le&s;s) caution, as it does not proceed from a doubt of your fidelity: but from a conviction of the tenderne&s;s of your connections, which will &s;carcely admit of the lea&s;t
<PB N="50" REF="031902_0048_0FEF3B50AABE0828">
re&s;erve. For, added he, I have experienced too many proofs of your &s;incere attachment, to harbour the mo&s;t di&s;tant idea of your &s;aying or doing any thing that might prove injurious to me, with de&s;ign. George a&s;&s;ured him he &s;hould never abu&s;e the confidence repo&s;ed in him, by any means, adding, that it would afford him the highe&s;t &s;atisfaction to &s;ee his friend completely happy.</P>
<P>After dinner, he &s;allied forth, determining to ex|plore, by day-light, the mine which contained the &s;um of all his earthly trea&s;ure. Accordingly, pa&s;&s;ing thro' all tho&s;e crooked defiles through which he had been con|ducted the preceding night, &s;oon di&s;covered the wic|ket, which he pa&s;&s;ed with &s;ome precipitation, and pa&s;&s;ing two angles of the garden-wall, found him&s;elf in a &s;pacious &s;treet, where, running his eye along that &s;ide of the wall which fronted the &s;treet, he perceived a con|nection between it and a magnificent building, which he rightly conjectured mu&s;t be the hou&s;e he &s;ought. He was confirmed in this opinion&mdash;for, pa&s;&s;|ing on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the &s;treet, he perceived two young ladies at one of the windows, one of whom was Leonora. She ob&s;erved him, and in&s;tantly retired.</P>
<P>He hurried home, and having de&s;cribed the building, &amp;c. to his friend, was a&s;&s;ured, it could be no other than the palace of the Doge, and that his mi&s;tre&s;s mu&s;t be his daughter. This information was received with manife&s;t &s;atisfaction by Mercutio, who determined to pur&s;ue his amour in con&s;equence.</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="031902_0049_0FEF3BD70DD7EA30">He carried on his operations with &s;uch precaution, that he continued his nocturnal vi&s;its for the &s;pace of eight months, when the effects of their illicit commerce began to appear, and to conceal it much longer, would have been a difficult ta&s;k, if not utterly impracticable. This circum&s;tance, which, in another &s;ituation, would have heightened their joys into rapture, embarra&s;&s;ed them exceedingly: But though difficulty and danger &s;tared them in the face, neither love, fortitude or inven|tion de&s;erted them in this emergency.</P>
<P>Speedy and effectual mea&s;ures being ab&s;olutely nece&s;|&s;ary, they devoted one whole night in deliberating what was mo&s;t proper to be done; and after propo&s;ing and rejecting &s;everal plans, determined, that Mercutio &s;hould immediately provide for their tran&s;portation to England, if po&s;&s;ible; if not, to &s;ome other part of the world. In the mean time, Leonora, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Margaretta, her maid, &s;hould be &s;etting all things in proper train for an elopement at a minute's warning. The&s;e preliminaries being &s;ettled, he returned home, and taking his well-tried friend a&s;ide, made known the project, and earne&s;tly &s;olicited his a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>I have a plan in my head, (&s;aid George, after pau&s;ing &s;ome time) which I am of opinion, if adopted, cannot fail of being &s;ucce&s;sful. I have a light ve&s;&s;el lying at a &s;mall di&s;tance from hence, which arrived but ye&s;terday from Valona, whither &s;he had been with a cargo of merchandize. Now, as the utmo&s;t privacy is requi&s;ite,
<PB N="52" REF="031902_0050_0FEF3B538D0148E0">
it would be highly improper to attempt &s;ailing in any of the ve&s;&s;els lying in the gulph, except this, as there is not one bound to any port in Great-Britain: I can have her ready in twelve hours, and will carry you down to O&s;imo in eight more, from whence you may travel ea&s;ily over land to Naples, in a &s;hort time, and remain incog. until your mi&s;tre&s;s can proceed with le&s;s difficulty, if you think proper; if not, there are gene|rally &s;hips from every part of Europe, &s;o that you may &s;ail for England when you plea&s;e. Now, what do you think of my plan? Why, I think, &s;aid Mercutio, nothing could have been &s;o fortunate, and it &s;hall be put in execution this night, if agreeable to you. The &s;ooner the better, &s;aid he, for it is hardly known that the ve&s;&s;el has returned, and if we can &s;ail early in the night, I can replace her in her pre&s;ent &s;ituation by &s;un|ri&s;e to-morrow at farthe&s;t, and &s;hall never be mi&s;&s;ed. The&s;e rea&s;ons appearing perfectly &s;atisfactory, he took leave in order to make the nece&s;&s;ary preparations for his departure. In the afternoon, they went on board, in order to &s;how the &s;ervants where to carry the bag|gage, as &s;oon as it was dark, while Mercutio conduct|ed Leonora. After taking a view of the ve&s;&s;el, and learning the neare&s;t way to it, they returned to George's hou&s;e, and by the time they had taken a &s;light refre&s;h|ment it was du&s;k. George, offered it as his opinion, that it would be mo&s;t proper to depart without taking a formal leave of the family, adding, that after matters were &s;ettled, and they arrived in England, he might write to his uncle, and inform him of the rea&s;on of his abrupt
<PB N="53" REF="031902_0051_0FEF3C2F3AF58950">
departure. This was agreed to, and Mercutio &s;at out, to pay his la&s;t vi&s;it at the Doge's, while his &s;ervants conveyed the baggage on board, and George with his little crew, got up the anchor and unfurled the &s;ails, &s;o that there might be no delay.</P>
<P>Mercutio found his mi&s;tre&s;s ready and willing to de|part, &s;o that they &s;oon &s;allied out at the wicket, and bidding an eternal, though &s;ilent farewell to the Doge, proceeded towards the water &s;ide: The faithful Mar|garetta bearing a large bundle of wearing apparel, and Mercutio an ebony box, crammed with ducats, which Leonora put into his hands, ju&s;t as they were leaving the hou&s;e, though he was ignorant of its contents until after their arrival at Naples.&mdash;They embarked &s;afely, having a fine breeze from the we&s;tward, and a &s;trong current &s;etting outward, anchored at O&s;imo in &s;ix hours.</P>
<P>It happened very fortunate for our adventurers, that George had an intimate friend there, who at that time lay under particular obligations to him. As &s;oon as they dropped anchor, George went on &s;hore, and re|paired immediately to the hou&s;e of his friend, and in|formed him, that there was a gentleman and his wife on board his ve&s;&s;el, wi&s;hing to proceed to Naples, and for particular rea&s;ons, to perform their journey as privately as po&s;&s;ible, and reque&s;ted him to procure a convenient vehicle to tran&s;port them. Here, &s;aid he, are thirty ducats&mdash;be faithful&mdash;be diligent. This is but a trifling earne&s;t of what I will do further for you. The gentle|man

will corre&s;pond with me during his &s;tay at Naples &mdash;you will forward our letters with care, &s;ecrecy and expedition. His friend a&s;&s;ured him he was happy in being charged with this commi&s;&s;ion, as it would afford him an opportunity of demon&s;trating his gratitude for the many favours he had already received Well, &s;aid George, I rely on your word; now come with me and conduct them to your hou&s;e, for I want to &s;ail im|mediately&mdash;I expect to &s;ee you again in a few days&mdash; in the mean time let nothing extort this &s;ecret from you.</P>
<P>George returned on board, and informed his depart|ing friend the &s;ub&s;tance of his negociation: Then taking an affectionate farewell, tho&s;e adventurers lan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed, and followed their new ho&s;t; while George &s;pread the can|vas to the wind, which at that time had veered round &s;everal points in his favour, &s;o that before the day dawned he had remoored and got home to his own hou&s;e&mdash;having performed a trip of more than forty-&s;ix leagues, in &s;omething le&s;s than ten hours and a half.</P>
<P>Proper apartments being a&s;&s;igned for the reception of our adventurers, they tetired to re&s;t, whil&s;t the vigilant ho&s;t went in &s;earch of a carriage to convey them to Naples, the en&s;uing day. Having &s;ucceeded to his wi&s;h, he returned, and informed his gue&s;ts, who were then up, and taking chocolate with his wife, a woman of good &s;en&s;e, who informed Leonora, that &s;he had a &s;i&s;ter, a widow, in Naples, an approved and experienced midwife, that kept a commodious hou&s;e fitted for the

reception of ladies in her &s;ituation, where they might be accommodated with every thing nece&s;&s;ary as long as &s;he plea&s;ed to remain. This was an agreeable piece of information; and her hu&s;band, in order to fulfil his engagements with George, in the fulle&s;t extent, made a tender of his &s;ervice to accompany them to his &s;i&s;ter in-law's, and negociate the whole bu&s;ine&s;s for them im|mediately on their arrival. This propo&s;al was accept|ed with joy, as it &s;eemed exactly adapted to their cir|cum&s;tances; for 'twould have been madne&s;s to have taken Leonora to &s;ea, except in a ca&s;e of the mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ing nece&s;&s;ity.</P>
<P>They &s;tarted next morning with the fir&s;t light, and arrived at the place of their de&s;tination on the fourth day about &s;un-&s;et. When they were within two leagues of Naples, their ho&s;t rode forward to provide for their reception, which having accompli&s;hed, he met the carriage about half a mile from the city, where they alighted and walked to their lodgings. They received a very cordial welcome from the mi&s;tre&s;s of the hou&s;e, who was a genteel a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">able per&s;on. An elegant &s;upper was &s;erved up, of which our young travellers eat hear|ty; and at an early hour were conducted to proper apartments for repo&s;e.</P>
<P>The next morning, Mercutio wrote to his friend George, to inform him of their &s;afe arrival, and reque&s;t|ed him to write as &s;peedily as po&s;&s;ible, as Leonora was anxious to hear how matters were conducted at Venice,

in con&s;equence of her elopement&mdash;well knowing her father's impetuous temper would, in the fir&s;t torrent of his rage, bear down all before it. This letter he deli|vered to his generous ho&s;t, accompanied by a pur&s;e of ducats, which, for &s;ome time he&s;trenuou&s;ly refu&s;ed; but on Mercutio's declaring, he &s;hould not look on him as his friend, if he did not accept it, with reluctance com|plied, &s;aying, heaven knows, I neither wi&s;hed or ex|pected any reward for the trifling pains I have taken to &s;erve you&mdash;you may re&s;t a&s;&s;ured, I would not have done and promi&s;ed what I have on any other con&s;idera|tion, but that of &s;erving my friend, who informed me, is deeply intere&s;ted in what concerns your welfare. He then departed, with a promi&s;e to forward all letters that came under his care, to and from him, with the greate&s;t &s;ecrecy and di&s;patch.</P>
<P>In five days, Mercutio had the inexpre&s;&s;ible &s;atisfac|tion of receiving the following letter from George, by the hand of his late friendly ho&s;t:&mdash;

<P>I RECEIVED yours by the bearer, who is faithful and diligent, and am happy to hear of your being ac|commodated &s;o much to your &s;atisfaction. You wi&s;h to know the con&s;equence of your departure&mdash;I will tell you: I arrived here &s;afely, before day, the next morn|ing after I parted with you. All things remained quiet that day&mdash;but there was not a crevice in Venice left un&s;earched by the en&s;uing evening. The &s;ucce&s;s
<PB N="57" REF="031902_0055_0FEF3BE0E336ADD0">
attending the &s;earch you are acquainted with. The Doge finding his endeavors to recover his daughter fruitle&s;s, cau&s;ed &s;trict enquiry to be made, whether any ve&s;&s;el had failed that night, or &s;ince, and was informed that a certain &s;wift-&s;ailing &s;loop had weighed, and &s;tood out to &s;ea early in the morning, but her de&s;tination could not be a&s;certained. He natu|rally concluded &s;he was on board the &s;loop. A young gentleman, a native of France, had left his lodgings, the hou&s;e of an eminent merchant which &s;tood in the &s;ame &s;treet where the Doge's palace &s;tands, where he had re&s;ided for &s;everal months, that very even|ing. It &s;eems he had contracted an intimacy with his landlord's daughter, the effects of which began to ap|pear; and although &s;he loved him to di&s;traction, and was willing to &s;uffer any thing rather than a &s;eparation, yet the unfeeling villain ab&s;conded privately, and pro|bably &s;ailed in the &s;loop, leaving the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed creature to a fate, which makes me &s;hudder at the bare recital. The Doge obtained information of a per&s;on of this de&s;cription having eloped, gave peremptory orders to have the merchant and his whole family in&s;tantly &s;eized and brought before him, concluding that their lodger had carried off his daughter, and they of cour&s;e acce&s;&s;ary: For as yet his &s;educing the merchant's daughter was not &s;u&s;pected. In vain the Doge endea|voured to extort confe&s;&s;ion from each of them apart, they per&s;i&s;ted in their innocence: He, therefore, com|manded them to be &s;eparately confined till next morn|ing, threatning them with the rack if they &s;hould &s;till
<PB N="58" REF="031902_0056_0FEF3BE2DF92A058">
per&s;i&s;t. The next day it was the &s;ame, but their a&s;&s;eve|rations of innocence &s;erved only to enrage the Doge. He ordered the in&s;truments of torture to be brought into his pre&s;ence. The merchant's daughter falling on her knees deplored the Doge to defer the dreadful pun|i&s;hment for a few minutes, while &s;he di&s;clo&s;ed the &s;ecrets of her &s;oul, of which her parents were ignorant. With a look of indignation he ordered her to proceed. Tho' my dear parents and my wretched &s;elf &s;tand as crimi|nals in your pre&s;ence, my lord, yet I tru&s;t I &s;hall be able to convince you of our innocence; yet in &s;o doing, I mu&s;t publi&s;h my own &s;hame. If M. de Gar|delle has robbed Venice of &s;o great a trea&s;ure as my lord's daughter, his treachery to me, and ingratitude to my parents, mu&s;t forever acquit us of having been either acce&s;&s;aries or principals in the crime. For, know, my lord, the faithle&s;s wretch had previou&s;ly effected the de&s;truction of the haple&s;s woman who now addre&s;&s;es you:&mdash;In a fatal hour I yielded to his fal&s;e promi&s;es, and by that means rendered my&s;elf an object of contempt. It is probable, by his artifice, he has found means to &s;educe your daughter, and, knowing my &s;ituation, per&s;uaded her to accompany him to France, where it is likely, when &s;ated with her com|pany, he will abandon her as he has me, to all the hor|rors of infamy and de&s;pair!&mdash;Oh! my unhappy parents! Pardon your wretched daughter&mdash;who cannot, will not &s;urvive the publication of her di&s;grace!&mdash;As &s;he pronounced the&s;e words, &s;he, to the a&s;toni&s;hment of all pre&s;ent, plunged a poignant in her brea&s;t, and expired
<PB N="59" REF="031902_0057_0FEF3B1DBB6FBA90">
in&s;tantly. Such a horrid &s;cene, could not fail to im|pre&s;s the mind of the Doge and tho&s;e of the &s;pectators, with a &s;trong conviction of the &s;incerity of her confe&s;&s;ion, as well as of the innocence of her parents. The Doge retired with manife&s;t marks of &s;orrow and confu&s;ion, and gave immediate orders for the liberation of the un|happy parents, who continued bathing the body of their dear, unfortunate child with tears! The next day, the Doge &s;ent for them, and was clo&s;eted with them for the &s;pace of three hours. The re&s;ult of their conference has not yet tran&s;pired: but the merchant&punc; who is a native of Spain, with the remains of his fami|ly, embarked this morning for Valencia.</P>
<P>Since this unhappy affair happened, there has been very little &s;aid about it, as the Venetians &s;eem willing to con&s;ign the remembrance of &s;uch a lamentable cata|&s;trophe to eternal oblivion. Let me intreat you to re|main as quiet as po&s;&s;ible, during your &s;tay at Naples; and as &s;oon as circum&s;tances will admit, to take &s;hip|ping for England. I informed my uncle the cau&s;e of your abrupt departure; concealing, however, my &s;hare in the enterprize: He is well plea&s;ed at your e&s;cape, and de&s;ires me to pre&s;ent his re&s;pects to you, together with his &s;incere wi&s;hes for your future welfare.&mdash; Continue to write every opportunity, and re&s;t a&s;&s;ured of my being, and remaining your &s;incere friend,</P>

<P><PB N="60" REF="031902_0058_0FEF3BE830C1F6D0">Mercutio, in con&s;equence of the preceding informa|tion, re&s;olved, as &s;oon as Leonora was able to &s;tir about after her confinement, to &s;ail for England.</P>
<P>At length, the much de&s;ired period arrived&mdash;when &s;he was &s;afely delivered of a beautiful boy, to the no &s;mall &s;atisfaction of our hero and his lovely companion. Leonora being diligently attended by her kind ho&s;te&s;s, and the faithful Magaretta, was &s;oon in a &s;ituation to undertake the intended voyage. Her &s;on, healthful and vigorous, grew exceedingly fa&s;t, and his father's features were &s;trikingly depicted in his face, which cir|cum&s;tance gave birth to the mo&s;t plea&s;ing reflections i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the minds of his parents.</P>
<P>Mercutio began immediately to make diligent enqui|ry for an Engli&s;h &s;hip; and finding one bound for Li|verpool, bargained with the commander, who&s;e name was Nichol&s;on, for his pa&s;&s;age. The &s;hip waited for nothing but a fair wind, therefore, he was as expedi|tious as po&s;&s;ible, in providing nece&s;&s;aries for the voyage, and conveying his baggage on board. Having arranged all his affairs in ample order, nothing remain|ed to be done, but to &s;atisfy his ho&s;te&s;s, and write a farewell epi&s;tle to his friend George. They devoted the la&s;t evening to mirth and hilarity; our hero hav|ing previou&s;ly di&s;charg'd his reckoning with two hun|dred ducats. Ju&s;t as they were &s;itting down to &s;up|per, they were &s;urpriz'd by the appearance of George and his friend. Mutual &s;alutations pa&s;t, George in|formed

them the cau&s;e of his journey as follows:&mdash; "About three days ago, I was informed by a Vene|tian gentleman, a friend of the Doge's, that the Doge of Naples had &s;ent a very pre&s;&s;ing invitation to the Doge of Venice, to honour him with a vi&s;it, which, in con|&s;ideration of the one he received from him when you were there, as well as the &s;trict amity exi&s;ting between them, he had accepted, and is expected in Naples this evening. I was afraid to commit this piece of intelli|gence to paper, and therefore &s;et out as &s;oon as I po&s;|&s;ibly could, in order to let you know your danger: For a di&s;covery now, might be attended with dreadful con|&s;equences."&mdash;My ine&s;timable friend, replied Mercutio, how &s;hall I ever make you a &s;uitable return for your di&s;intere&s;ted exertions in my favour? Unadulterated friend&s;hip is all you hold worthy your acceptance, and it &s;hall be my chief care, to pre&s;erve that inviolate and undimini&s;hed. We are, my dear George, to embark for Liverpool to-morrow morning&mdash;I have every thing on board, and if the wind &s;hould prove favorable, the &s;hip will &s;ail immediately, &s;o that if heaven permits, we &s;hall &s;oon be on the Briti&s;h &s;hore; and, probably, the fir&s;t letter you receive from me will inform you of the celebration of our happy union. May heaven grant you a &s;afe, and agreeable pa&s;&s;age, returned George.</P>
<P>At a very late hour they retired to re&s;t, and before the dawn of day, were all a&s;&s;embled in the common apartment, where they reiterated their former pro|fe&s;&s;ions of eternal friend&s;hip. Our voyagers taking
<PB N="62" REF="031902_0060_0FEF3B562AA3B5E0">
an affectionate leave of their ho&s;te&s;s, &s;et out, accompa|nied by George and his friend. The anchor was weighing by the time they got on board, and George, having &s;een them &s;afe through the whole of this dan|gerous enterprize, wi&s;hed them a pro&s;perous voyage, and returned to the &s;hore.</P>
<P>Our hero was as happy at the commencement of this voyage, as the nature of the circum&s;tances would per|mit: Leonora too, promi&s;ed her&s;elf the mo&s;t perfect felicity in the endearing company of her beloved Mer|cutio, and with the enchanting prattle of the dear pledge of their mutual affection. Mercutio had previou&s;ly di&s;patched a packet to England, to inform his friends of the time of his intended departure from Naples, and in the letter to his mother, he &s;ignified his intention of bringing with him a Venetian lady, whom he intended to make his wife, with the approbation of his friends, immediately on his arrival in London. But it is the uncontrolable will of heaven, that man, when he for|gets his origin, and looks up with confidence to &s;upreme felicity as already within his gra&s;p, &s;hould experience the cha&s;ti&s;ing rod of affliction, in order to bring him to a &s;en&s;e of his duty&mdash;to acknowledge his own imbecility and the omnipotence of that Being, from whom all happine&s;s, whether in heaven or on earth, mu&s;t flow; and to whom all thanks are nece&s;&s;arily due. A &s;triking in&s;tance of this was exhibited in the ca&s;e before us. Mer|cutio conceived that nothing could intervene to bla&s;t the flattering pro&s;pect which had ju&s;t engaged his at|tention;
<PB N="63" REF="031902_0061_0FEF3BED58AA1A28">
but which was on the eve of di&s;appearing: The fatal moment was fa&s;t approaching, in which all his imaginary joys were to vani&s;h, like the fleet|ing meteor: The cloud was already collected, and &s;u&s;pending over his head, which was &s;hortly to bur&s;t and involve him in mi&s;ery. How vain! how trifling! in the view of Omnipotence, are the pur&s;uits of &s;hort <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ighted mortals;&mdash;ever anxious to &s;ecure happine&s;s which &s;hall be permanent, our imagination is eternal|ly on the wing; our invention is tortured for &s;chemes to &s;ecure the glittering phantom, and we madly re|ject the &s;ub&s;tance, which thro' life, is con&s;tantly with|in our reach; and ignorantly pur&s;ue a &s;hadow, which we never can&mdash;never will overtake.</P>
<P>They had ju&s;t weather'd Comin, on the I&s;le of Sar|dinia, when a mo&s;t tremendous hurricane from the N. W. accompanied with an irre&s;i&s;table current &s;etting out of the gulph of Lyons, and violently pa&s;&s;ing be|tween Minorca and Sardinia, drove them, in &s;pite of their &s;kill and indu&s;try, into the Streights of Me&s;|&s;ina. The day was ju&s;t clo&s;ing when they doubled the cape, which tended to aggravate the horror of the &s;cene which immediately &s;ucceeded. The awful bur&s;ts of thunder, and &s;treams of livid lightning, together with dreadful &s;qualls of hail, rain, and wind, &s;eemed to threaten a final di&s;&s;olution. The whole univer&s;e ap|peared in violent convul&s;ions, and the &s;hip was hurled about like an egg-&s;hell in this elemental conflict, which none but the mo&s;t in&s;en&s;ible being, could have be|held
<PB N="64" REF="031902_0062_0FEF3BF0B1F52388">
without horror. To admini&s;ter comfort to Leo|nora was the whole bu&s;ine&s;s of Mercutio, during the &s;torm, and it was with much difficulty he pre&s;erved her from fainting.</P>
<P>About day light, however, it pleas'd that God in who&s;e hand the whole univer&s;e is but as a grain of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">and, to quell the fury of the unfathomable deep&mdash;to re|buke the winds; and immediately all was hu&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">'d in|to profund tranquillity. The cloud<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> di&s;pers'd&mdash;the blue concave appear'd in its native &s;plendor, and the beams of that glorious diffu&s;er of light and heat, con|veyed new vigor to the benumbed limbs of the fatigued mariners, and cheerfulne&s;s once more reigned through|out the whole.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the &s;torm &s;ub&s;ided, captain Nichol&s;on ordered all hands to appear on the quarter deck, when both &s;eamen and pa&s;&s;engers beat, in lowly reverence, to that all merciful Being, who&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;tance is ever at hand, to relieve and &s;upport his unworthy creatures, and offered up the acceptable &s;acrifice of grateful hearts, in the mo&s;t unfeigned thanks for his divine protection during the &s;torm, without which they mu&s;t inevitably have peri&s;hed. This done, they began to repair their &s;hattered &s;ails and rigging, which had &s;uffered much in the hurricane. Though they were much rejoiced with their late deliverance, their &s;atisfaction was con&s;iderably damped, when the captain found that they were within a few leagues of Malta, and le&s;s of the coa&s;t of
<PB N="65" REF="031902_0063_0FEF3BF6C669C110">
Barbary; and, as the wind &s;till blew fre&s;h from the N. W. it would be exceedingly difficult to keep off the coa&s;t; con&s;equently, they would be in continual danger of the rovers, until they made the Streights of Gi|braltar. They in&s;tantly braced up, and laid the &s;hip as clo&s;e to the wind as po&s;&s;ible, &s;tood away for the South point of Sicily. They had &s;ailed only three hours in this direction, when the captain, from the main topma&s;t head, di&s;covered a cor&s;air, at the di&s;tance of about three leagues and a half, bearing down on them. Capt. Nichol&s;on immediately &s;hifted his cour&s;e, in hopes of making Puzoli, before the pirate could reach them; but in this he was unfortunately di&s;appointed; though it is very probable, he might have &s;ucceded, had his ve&s;&s;el been in as good &s;ailing order, as &s;he was before the late &s;torm; but it was impracticable in the pre&s;ent &s;hattered condition to e&s;cape&mdash;the pirates gained on them every moment.</P>
<P>When the captain found all his endeavours to e&s;cape fruitle&s;s, he told Mercutio, that their liberty, property, and perhaps lives, depended on their courage and ac|tivity: Therefore, added he, I expect you will lend me all the a&s;&s;i&s;tance in your power. There are three guns on board, which I will load with grape, and bring them to bear in an oblique direction: I have, &s;ixteen hands be&s;ides my&s;elf, and you with your two &s;ervants will make twenty;&mdash;we have &s;mall arms plenty, with which we mu&s;t endeavour to prevent them from board|ing us:&mdash;For my part, I am determined never to &s;ur|render
<PB N="66" REF="031902_0064_0FEF3B74CFDE7448">
while I have a living man, or a load of ammu|nition on board. We will, continued he, flee fro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> them as fa&s;t as we can, as well to gain time to arrange matters, as to amu&s;e and fatigue them&mdash;and when they get within reach of our guns, &s;uddenly tack and pour in a volley, which, perhaps, will throw them into di&s;order, and if their number and metal does not exceed ours, decide the matter in our favor.</P>
<P>Mercutio a&s;&s;ured him, that all the a&s;&s;i&s;tance in his power &s;hould be devoted to his &s;ervice, and they imme|mediately made the nece&s;&s;ary di&s;po&s;itions for the event. The pirate, in the mean time, was not idle, but bore down upon them with crouded &s;ails and oars; and in a &s;hort time hailed captain Nichol&s;on, and ordered him, if he wi&s;hed to experience any mercy, to bring too immediately, and &s;trike his colours. The captain having all things in readine&s;s, clapt his helm a-lee, and was about in an in&s;tant; then poured in a well-directed fire, which killed four of the Turks and wound|ed two Chri&s;tian &s;laves, who were chained to the oar. This &s;udden, unexpected volley, and the execution performed by it, di&s;concerted the pirates con&s;iderably, but being thirty in number, be&s;ides eight Chri&s;tians at the oar, they returned the fire vigorou&s;ly, and dropping a&s;tern, di&s;charged &s;ix double fortified fours into the cabin windows, by which, the unfortunate Leonora, her &s;on, and Margaretta, were at the &s;ame moment, &s;ent into eternity!&mdash;The galley then came along &s;ide, and the commander levelling his piece at the brave captain
<PB N="67" REF="031902_0065_0FEF3B5A5F11FEA8">
Nichol&s;on, &s;hot him through the heart. Mercutio con|tinued the conflict, with great firmne&s;s and courage. The galley having grappled the &s;hip, the infidels im|mediately attempted to board her; but were bravely repul&s;ed&mdash;Mercutio, jumping into the mizen chains, cut off, with his hanger, the arms of two Turks, who fell overboard and were drowned. The pirates then made a feint of falling off; but ju&s;t as our hero was &s;tepping out of the chains, he received a ball in his right knee, which laid him pro&s;trate on the quarter deck. The pirates immediately grappled again, and without much re&s;i&s;tance, boarded the &s;hip, as there were only two men left unwounded. Captain Ni|cho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;on, his two mates, the carpenter, Mercutio's two &s;ervants, and five forema&s;t men were killed; and Mer|cutio, the boat&s;wain, cook, cabin-boy, and three &s;ailors wounded. The lo&s;s on the part of the Turks, was twelve killed, exclu&s;ive of four &s;laves, and three wounded.</P>
<P>Mercutio's wound bled amazingly, by which means he became in&s;en&s;ible, and remained in that &s;ituation till the pirates, perceiving &s;ome &s;igns of life, and judging by his habit, that he was a per&s;on of di&s;tinction, had conveyed him on board the galley, and confined him to a ring-bolt, on his back. 'Twas in this unhappy &s;itu|ation he became &s;en&s;ible, when, making an effort to ri&s;e, he found him&s;elf chained hand and foot!&mdash;But what words can de&s;cribe the intolerable angui&s;h of his &s;oul, when he was informed, by one of his
<PB N="68" REF="031902_0066_0FEF3BF86F9146D0">
fellow-captives, of the dreadful fate of the beaute|ous Leonora and her lovely infant! Had he not been chained fa&s;t to the deck, it is more than probable, that, in the mid&s;t of de&s;pair, he would have leaped overboard; but finding it impo&s;&s;ible to move out of the &s;pot, he gave him&s;elf up to immoderate grief! and formed the de&s;perate re&s;olution of taking no food, in order, as he expre&s;&s;ed it, to end his life and mi&s;eries as quick as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>The wound he had received having never been at|tended, grew very painful; and being overheated in the action, he had caught a violent cold, which brought on an intermittent fever, &s;o that at the time the galley arrived at Algiers, he was actually delirious. The re|negado who commanded, was a Spaniard, who judg|ing Mercutio a per&s;on of quality, had him taken to his own hou&s;e, and procured an eminent phy&s;ician, who applied &s;uch healing medicines, that in about one month he was rein&s;tated in his health; but &s;till remained di&s;|con&s;olate for his beloved Leonora and darling &s;on.</P>
<P>The renegado, perceiving the health of Mercutio re|&s;tored, a&s;ked him &s;everal que&s;tions relative to his coun|try and connexions, and whether he had any expecta|tion of being ran&s;omed. Mercutio an&s;wered, that if a letter could be conveyed &s;afely to London, he was &s;ure of being ran&s;omed. This was granted, and he di&s;patch|ed one letter to his father, and another to his friend George Wright.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="031902_0067_0FEF3B3635BA2680">The renegado demanded three hundred crowns for his ran&s;om; and as he had lo&s;t &s;everal of his men in the late engagement, he took our hero and three of his fellow captives on board his own galley, where they were con&s;trained to row night and day, chained to the thwart they &s;at on. They had no occa&s;ion to per|form voluntary ab&s;tinence&punc; for their food was of the coar&s;e&s;t kind, and the quantities &s;o &s;mall as to be but barely &s;ufficient to &s;upport them in a life of wretched bondage. This cruel &s;lavery bore much heavier on Mercutio than his companions in di&s;tre&s;s, having never been accu&s;tomed to hard&s;hips. His hands were &s;oon &s;tript of &s;kin, yet his mercile&s;s commanders compel|led him to labour, though the blood ran in &s;treams down the handle of the oar.&mdash;He who 'till then, had been clothed with the fine&s;t production of the loom, had no other covering than a frock and drawers of the coar&s;e&s;t canvas, without &s;hoes or &s;tockings. His feet began to &s;well and grow exceedingly pain|ful. Three months had elap&s;ed without any news arriving from England or Venice, all hands having been pre&s;&s;ed in the Downs out of the ve&s;&s;el that had &s;ailed to England; and the other having foundered off Minorca, and all on board peri&s;hed: However, he obtained leave to write once more to Venice, and, in a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">bout &s;ix weeks, received a letter from his friend George, wherein he a&s;&s;ured him he &s;hould have the money in fifteen days without fail.</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="031902_0068_0FEF3BFA13DE6918">The money arrived at the appointed time, with three hundred crowns more than he had reque&s;ted, to furni&s;h him with clothes and other nece&s;&s;aries; and an invitation, to come and re&s;ide in Venice for &s;ome time. Our hero would willingly have waved going there, well knowing that the very fight of the ci|ty would be a dagger to his &s;oul; yet, the regard he had for his friend, and the great and many obliga|tions he lay under, &s;ilenced every objection that pre|&s;ented it&s;elf, and decided the matter quickly. He paid the renegado the &s;um demanded for his own ran|&s;om, and two hundred crowns for his three companions in &s;lavery, who, with him&s;elf were immediately liberat|ted. He gave the three poor fellows ten crowns each, and told them to make the be&s;t of their way home; but they finding him going to Venice; begged permi&s;|&s;ion to &s;ail on board the &s;ame &s;hip, as they had no chance of getting their pa&s;&s;age to England, and added, that, when he was gone, the Turks might &s;eize and en&s;lave them again. This he complied with, and they all embarked on board the &s;hip in which George had &s;ent the money, and arrived at Venice in a &s;hort time.</P>
<P>Our hero having taken leave of the&s;e poor fellows, who expre&s;&s;ed their gratitude to him in the mo&s;t fervent manner, went to &s;ee his well tried friend, whom he found in health, but not quite &s;o cheerful as former|ly, having ju&s;t returned from the funeral of his uncle and aunt, who both expired in one day. He was re|ceived, however, with unaffected kindne&s;s, which he
<PB N="71" REF="031902_0069_0FEF3BFD6E538EE0">
experienced for the &s;pace of &s;ix weeks, the time he remained in Venice; and, having pretty well recruited his health and &s;pirits, he re&s;olved to embark for En|gland on board the fir&s;t &s;hip he could find bound thither. George endeavoured to di&s;&s;uade him from his purpo&s;e, by repre&s;enting to him the danger of being cap|tured by the French privateers; that nation having entered into an alliance with the States of America: Who had thrown off the Hanoverian yoke, and de|clared them&s;elves Independent; and, under the au&s;pi|ces of a gentleman of Virginia, (George Wa&s;hing|ton) who had given indubitable proofs of his bravery and &s;kill in tacties, in former wars between France and England, were bravely &s;truggling again&s;t the de&s;|potic arms of Great-Britain, in &s;upport of the inde|fea&s;ible Rights of Man.</P>
<P>Mercutio, however; was not to be diverted from undertaking, his intended voyage: Di&s;con&s;olate for the lo&s;s of Leonora, and weary of the repeated vici&s;|&s;itudes of his adver&s;e fate, he re&s;olved to attempt a pa&s;&s;age to England at all events.</P>
<P>George finding it to no purpo&s;e to per&s;i&s;t, urged the matter no further; but procured a ve&s;&s;el, and furni&s;hed him with a &s;um of money, more than &s;ufficient to de|fray every expence. In a &s;hort time he was ready to embark, and having taken leave of his kind friends, with the mo&s;t grateful acknowledgment for all pa&s;t favors, and promi&s;ing to remit the money George had
<PB N="72" REF="031902_0070_0FEF3C034A3F3310">
&s;o freely advanced for his ran&s;om, &amp;c. by the fir&s;t op|portunity after his arrival in London, once more bid adieu to Venice.</P>
<P>Fortune favoured them with pro&s;perous gales and plea&s;ant weather; and in a few days, they were imper|ceptibly wa&s;ted within &s;ight of the Lizard. Mercutio, for the fir&s;t time, &s;ince his redemption from captivity, became cheerful. He experienced that kind of &s;atis|faction, which the hople&s;s mariner, who, having been deprived the fight of land or &s;un&s;hine for many days, and all the time threatened by the devouring waves, to be buried in the bowels of the deep, is &s;uddenly wafted into the de&s;ired haven.</P>
<P>They arrived, and moored off Deal without an acci|dent. Mercutio propo&s;ed hiring a po&s;t-chai&s;e, and to &s;et out for London the next morning. But alas! Fortune, that fickle godde&s;s, had rai&s;ed her foot with a de&s;ign to give him another kick. Pre&s;s-warrants were out for rai&s;ing ten thou&s;and &s;eamen; in con&s;equence of which, a lieutenant and forty &s;eamen boarded the &s;hip, about midnight; and, &s;lipping down between decks, made prize of the whole crew, and among the re&s;t, Mercutio.</P>
<P>Re&s;i&s;tance would have been as vain as it was im|practicable, they therefore made a virtue of nece&s;&s;ity, and &s;ubmitted to be conveyed on board the Otter, (a tender) where they remained for &s;ome days, and then put on board the I&s;is, of 50 guns, at Spithead. They were welcomed on board with three cheers from the
<PB N="73" REF="031902_0071_0FEF3C04DD1A0AF0">
whole crew. The lieutenant who had pre&s;&s;ed them, cau&s;ed plenty of grog to be di&s;tributed among the new hands: This done, he ordered the boat&s;wain's mate to bring them aft, where he read over the articles of war; after which, he entertained them with the following eloquent ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rangue.</P>
<P>"Ship-mates and brother &s;ailors!&mdash;But I &s;peak chiefly to you that's come aboard la&s;t.

<P>The major part of the pre&s;&s;ed men accepted this po|lite invitation, while he continued to di&s;play his rhetori|cal powers:&mdash;"Come, my brave me&s;s-mates, now is the time to EXTINGUISH your&s;elves in OFFENCE of your king and country&mdash;There an't a man in England but mu&s;t turn out now, d&mdash;n me, either by &s;ea or land; and, for my part, I'd rather be an under-turnkey in hell, than a SOGER, d&mdash;n me if I had'nt."</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="031902_0072_0FEF3B21531A5D98">This animating oration had a great effect on the tar-pawlings; for as he very ju&s;tly ob&s;erved, there they were, and there they were like to remain, con&s;equent|ly, might as well comply as not&mdash;&s;o they generally took his advice. Adver&s;e as Mercutio's fate appeared, he did not ab&s;olutely de&s;pair of procuring his liberty, if he could gain acce&s;s to the commander; but found, on enquiry, that he was on &s;hore. Finding no officer on board &s;uperior to this loquacious &s;on of Neptune, he re&s;olved to &s;olicit his a&s;&s;i&s;tance in remitting a letter to London. Having executed this re&s;olve, this patriotic officer gave him the following an&s;wer:&mdash;"I'll tell you what, me&s;s-mate, you may write a letter to Lunnan, but I'm d&mdash;'d if I think it will be of any &s;ervice to you. However, if you think it will do you any good, as you have the look of a clever fellow, I'll &s;peak to the pur|&s;er for pen, ink and paper for you; and when I go a&s;hore to night, I'll clap it in the po&s;t-office. But God knows when or where we &s;hall &s;ail&mdash;we may &s;ail to|morrow, and mayhap we may'nt this month, d'ye &s;ee." Mercutio thanked him for his civility, and told him he would &s;atisfy him for his trouble.

<P>Our hero paid very little attention to what he &s;aid, but &s;at down on a che&s;t, and wrote a very pre&s;&s;ing let|ter to his father, informing him of the de&s;perate cir|cum&s;tances under which he lay, and earne&s;tly reque&s;t|ing him to employ all po&s;&s;ible means to obtain his re|lea&s;e. Having delivered the letter to his friend the lieutenant, he grew cheerful, and began to cheri&s;h the hope of being yet re&s;tored to his friends, without being forced to &s;ea again. But Providence, it &s;eems, had otherwi&s;e decreed. The next morning, very early, orders came on board, for the I&s;is, with two frigates, and &s;ome tran&s;ports, to weigh, and &s;ail the next tide. Their de&s;tination was to &s;ome part of the Continent; but as the &s;pecial orders were &s;ealed, and not to be opened till they had got into a certain degree of latitude, the particular port was unknown.</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="031902_0074_0FEF3C09A1A07D70">The captain and officers who had been on &s;hore, came on board &s;oon after the &s;ailing orders, and Mer|cutio made application, by letter (through his friend the lieutenant) for a di&s;charge&mdash;but without effect: In vain he repre&s;ented the &s;ufferings he had endured in Algiers, from whence he had been &s;o lately redeemed &mdash;he was deaf to his entreaties: All the con&s;ola|tion he received, was, that if he behaved well, he might make his fortune before the war was over.</P>
<P>Finding all his efforts defeated, he con&s;igned him&s;elf to his fate. His countenance became gloomy and thoughtful; and had he remained long in that &s;tate, it is more than probable, he would have degenerated in|to a mo&s;t un&s;ocial being&mdash;&s;o, true it is, that the &s;weete&s;t temper may be &s;oured by frequent repul&s;es and di&s;ap|pointments.</P>
<P>The nece&s;&s;ary preparations being made, the an|chor was weighed; the &s;ails extended to the expanding gale; and with drums beating, trumpets &s;ounding, colours flying, and every other demon&s;tration of naval joy, they took their departure.</P>
<P>Satisfaction appeared con&s;picuous on every counte|nance on board, except that of Mercutio's, which was impre&s;&s;ed with marks of the deepe&s;t melancholy.

had never taken notice of Mercutio till they had been a full week at &s;ea. This gentleman ob&s;erving him in a pen&s;ive attitude one day, at the &s;ame time remarking, that he had not the lea&s;t appearance of a &s;eaman; enquired of the &s;econd lieutenant who he was, and from whence he came.</P>
<P>Being informed of this, and that he had been late|ly relea&s;ed from the Algerines, he was impatient to have &s;ome di&s;cour&s;e with a per&s;on of &s;o &s;ingular a de&s;cription. He wrote a billet, and &s;ent it by the ca|bin-boy, reque&s;ting a &s;hort interview. Our hero, after peru&s;ing the billet, ordered the boy to conduct him to the per&s;on who had &s;ent him: He followed, neither knowing nor caring who it was that de&s;ired the interview. On entering the cabin he &s;aluted the lieu|tenant with a very low bow, who in&s;tantly aro&s;e, and taking our hero by the hand, very politely returned the &s;alute. But what words can paint the amazement and joy of Mercutio, when in the features of the lieutenant he recogni&s;ed tho&s;e of his beloved friend Charles, Lu|cinda's brother! Charles in&s;tantly recollected his fea|tures&mdash;and ru&s;hing into each others arms, they em|braced with mutual tran&s;port, without uttering a &s;yllable: The &s;udden &s;hock of joy having &s;hackled their organs of &s;peech for &s;everal minutes.</P>
<P>Mercutio fir&s;t recovering his &s;peech &s;aid, My dear Charles, my tongue would but di&s;cover its impotence in attempting to de&s;cribe the plea&s;ing &s;en&s;ations which pervade my &s;oul, on this occa&s;ion&mdash;to meet a friend

&s;o much e&s;teemed, after &s;o long and painful a &s;epara|ration, is a happine&s;s &s;o unexpected, that my weak frame, fatigued and emaciated, with trouble, di&s;ap|pointment, and melancholy, is almo&s;t unable to &s;u&s;tain the &s;udden &s;hock, which, like the &s;wift winged, livid lightning, has penetrated the very centre of my &s;oul&mdash;&s;tunned my whole fabric&mdash;and unhinged all my &s;en&s;es.

<P>Mercutio, after making him &s;uch an an&s;wer as his unbounded, di&s;intere&s;ted offers merited, related the whole of his adventures, from the time they parted la&s;t, in London, till they met on board the I&s;is: con|cealing, however, his amour with Leonora.</P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="031902_0077_0FEF3C0FA4BC2108">Charles generou&s;ly &s;ympathized with him in all his misfortunes, promi&s;ed to render him all the &s;ervice in his power, and to repre&s;ent his ca&s;e to the captain, who, notwith&s;tanding his profe&s;&s;ion, was a gentleman of the nice&s;t feelings, and mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed merit; and, added he, if the fleet is detained on the Ameri|can coa&s;t, I think I have influence enough with him to procure your di&s;chage, and you can &s;ail from New-York to England at any time, as packets are con&s;tantly going and coming.

<P>From that time Charles and Mercutio eat, drank, and &s;lept together; the officers vied with each other in a genteel treatment to him, and the captain became his firm friend.

your travels, I have experienced many hard &s;trokes my&s;elf.</P>
<P>"Some time after your departure, Augu&s;tus Daven|port, &s;on of Sir Edward Davenport, of Oxford&s;hire, having &s;een my &s;i&s;ter Charlotte, at my uncle's &s;eat, which lies contiguous to Sir Edward's, where &s;he was on a vi&s;it, came to London, and re&s;ided with his brother in-law, Sir Benjamin Godfrey. As his journey to the metropolis, was undertaken with a view of &s;etting on foot an hymeneal treaty between him and my &s;i&s;ter, he engaged Sir Benjamin, (knowing the great friend&s;hip exi&s;ting between him and my father) to intro|duce him, and a&s;&s;i&s;t in the cour&s;e of the negociation with his recommendation and advice.&mdash;He was &s;hortly permitted to pay his addre&s;&s;es to Charlotte&mdash;When matters were nearly ripe, Augu&s;tus took leave for &s;ome time.&mdash;He returned, accompanied by his father and&mdash;a &s;i&s;ter&mdash;That &s;i&s;ter!&mdash;Oh Mercutio! do not &s;uppo&s;e your&s;elf unfortunate!&mdash;But I'll proceed: The marriage contract being &s;anctioned with the ap|probation of all parties, they were married, to the great &s;atisfaction of both families.</P>
<P>"After &s;taying &s;ix weeks in town, Sir Edward pro|po&s;ed returning to his country &s;eat; and, as Augu&s;tus after tarrying a while at his father's, intended to take his wife to a &s;eat which Sir Edward had lately purcha&s;ed and promi&s;ed to give him whenever he &s;hould enter the bands of wedlock, the old knight re|que&s;ted,
<PB N="82" REF="031902_0080_0FEF3C13C984E3C0">
or rather in&s;i&s;ted, that I &s;hould accompany them thither. I acquie&s;ced, being prompted by more powerful motives than tho&s;e produced by his invitation.</P>
<P>"We &s;at out, all on hor&s;e-back, and had a very agreeable ride to Sir Edward's, who treated us nobly for the &s;pace of one month, at the end of which, Au|gu&s;tus prepared to go to his own &s;eat. I, as well as his &s;i&s;ter, accompanied them. But, now, Mercutio, your repeated misfortunes, though great, will quickly di&s;ap|pear, when you hear the &s;equel&mdash;I might almo&s;t &s;ay with the Gho&s;t of Hamlet:
<Q>I can a tale unfold, who&s;e lighte&s;t word will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">arrow up thy foul! Freeze thy young blood!

<P>"This daughter of Sir Edward was, I believe, a model of beauty and apparent innocence. She po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed every accompli&s;hment nece&s;&s;ary to render a woman lovely, and the undivided po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her, a peculiar ble&s;&s;ing.

This enchanting paragon, without intention, or even &s;u&s;picion, e&s;tabli&s;hed &s;o ab&s;olute a dominion over my &s;oul, that the very thought of parting with her, was as daggers to my heart!&mdash;I addre&s;&s;ed her on the

One year I lived with her in &s;o great a degree of felicity, that I would not have exchanged my &s;ituation for all the riches of the Ea&s;t.</P>
<P>"She wi&s;hed to vi&s;it her friends at Oxford&s;hire&mdash;I con&s;ented; for what could I refu&s;e to her who&s;e brea&s;t was the repo&s;itory of my &s;oul?&mdash;We found Sir Ed|ward in good health; and after &s;taying a few days, proceeded to the &s;eat of Augu&s;tus, where we arrived ju&s;t as Charlotte had made her fir&s;t appearance at church after the birth of a beautiful boy.</P>
<P>"While we remained there, all the neighbouring gentry for &s;everal miles round, came to congratulate the young couple on the birth of an heir. Among tho&s;e who appeared the mo&s;t a&s;&s;iduous, was Charles Howard, &s;on to a noble Earl, who I afterwards found, had been acquainted with Loui&s;a Davenport, from her infancy, but had not &s;een her during the la&s;t five years. This per&s;on, though a villain of the fir&s;t magnitude, had neverthele&s;s, by long practice in the in&s;idious arts of &s;eduction, become an adept in di&s;&s;imulation, &s;o that he had actually &s;ecured the good opinion of every per&s;on of condition in and about Oxford&s;hire&mdash;con&s;equently, was received into all parties of plea&s;ure with a hearty welcome; and was never parted with but with regret. He was remarkably a&s;&s;iduous in congratulating my&s;elf
<PB N="84" REF="031902_0082_0FEF3B2FAEE68FB0">
and wife on our late union, and at length received an invitation to pay us a vi&s;it in London.</P>
<P>"One evening, as I was &s;itting with my wife, in one of the &s;ide-boxes of Drury-Lane theatre, Howard entered the &s;ame box, and &s;eated him&s;elf over again&s;t us; my wife knew him in&s;tantly, and welcomed him to London. He &s;eemed &s;urprized at this meeting&mdash;I immediately recollected his features, and ro&s;e to &s;alute him&mdash;he returned the &s;alute in a very polite manner, and &s;eating him&s;elf on our &s;ide, informed us in a whi&s;|per, that he had ju&s;t arrived in town. My wife and he began a whi&s;pering dialogue; the &s;ubject of which was on her part, an enquiry about the people in Ox|ford&s;hire.</P>
<P>"The play being ended, he very politely took leave, having previou&s;ly received an invitation to pay us a vi&s;it the fir&s;t opportunity, which he promi&s;ed to ob&s;erve.</P>
<P>"Some &s;hort time after, he paid the vi&s;it; but as I happened to be abroad, I was deprived of the oppor|tunity of &s;eeing him; which, I &s;uppo&s;e, was no di&s;ap|pointment: For I have every rea&s;on to think my wife entertained him to his &s;atisfaction&punc;</P>

<P>"I was in&s;tantly tempted, by &s;ome unaccountable im|pul&s;e, to open the letter which he had told me was for my wife, and reque&s;ted him to let me &s;ee the &s;uper&s;crip|tion.

He &s;eemed &s;urprized, but replied, he knew of none&mdash;adding, that Jenny (the chamber|maid) had let &s;omebody in a few minutes ago, and on his a&s;king her who it was, &s;aid it was her ma&s;ter. This was enough: I made no delay, but going in, &s;hut the &s;treet door, locked it, and putting the key in my pocket, proceeded cautiou&s;ly up &s;tairs.</P>
<P>"I li&s;tened a moment at the door, and heard enough to convince me of my di&s;honor. In a degree of rage bordering on madne&s;s, I bur&s;t open the door! They were on the bed:&mdash;I drew in&s;tantly, and calling him ba&s;e villain&mdash;cur&s;ed traitor, with many other epithets of the &s;ame kind, ordered him to ri&s;e and defend him|&s;elf; as I was determined to lo&s;e my life or puni&s;h his perfidy with death. He ro&s;e with apparent reluctance, and drew his &s;word, which lay on the table, and put him&s;elf in a po&s;ture of defence. After a few pa&s;&s;es, I left him for dead on the floor&mdash;having run him quite through the body. Turning to my faithle&s;s wife, Madam, &s;aid I, though you de&s;erve a &s;imilar fate, yet I forbear the &s;acrifice: Perhaps you can find &s;ome &s;ub|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">erfuge to vindicate your conduct to the world; but

con&s;cience will not be impo&s;ed on. I therefore leave you to the &s;tings of that monitor.</P>
<P>"Before I left the hou&s;e, I ordered a &s;ervant to go for a &s;urgeon, that if the wretch had any remains of life, he might be &s;aved if po&s;&s;ible. Whether he lived or died I know not. I went immediately to my fa|ther's, and in as few words as the circum&s;tances would admit, informed him of the whole tran&s;action. He was much alarmed, told me I had acted extremely wrong in committing &s;uch a ra&s;h and de&s;perate act: However, as the thing was done, and as it was ab&s;o|lutely nece&s;&s;ary for me to di&s;appear &s;peedily, for &s;ome time at lea&s;t, he immediately wrote a letter to the ad|miral, with whom he was intimately acquainted, re|que&s;ting him to appoint me to &s;ome po&s;t on board one of his maje&s;ty's &s;hips; at the &s;ame time giving him &s;ome hint of the cau&s;e of his making the reque&s;t. He then gave me one thou&s;and guineas, and bank notes to four times that amount; to which he &s;ubjoined his ble&s;&s;ing, with tears, as did al&s;o my honored mother: Both of them lamenting with me the fatal cau&s;e of the di&s;agreeable &s;eparation.</P>
<P>"I in&s;tantly took hor&s;e for Port&s;mouth, attended by a &s;ervant who is now on board. The admiral received me in a very polite and friendly manner; and when he had read the letter, told me, he was very &s;orry it was not in his power to &s;upply me with any thing higher than a fir&s;t lieutenancy, of a fifty gun &s;hip, having no|thing

better in his gift; but a&s;&s;ured me of the fir&s;t va|cancy. He then pre&s;ented me with the commi&s;&s;ion immediately; and now, &s;aid he, I will give you the orders for &s;ailing, as that fleet mu&s;t &s;ail with the fir&s;t fair wind. The &s;ecretary copied the orders, and the admi|ral, after &s;ealing, delivered them to me, together with a letter from the captain.</P>
<P>"The wind being fair when I came on board, the captain, on reading the admiral's letter, hoi&s;ted the &s;ignal for &s;ailing. What has taken place &s;ince, you know already. And now, you mu&s;t confe&s;s, that I have had no &s;mall &s;hare of misfortune&mdash;neverthele&s;s, I endeavour to eradicate the impre&s;&s;ions it has made in my mind; 'tis true, the reflection gave me much unea&s;i|ne&s;s for two or three days, but I find my&s;elf quite ea&s;y and cheerful now."</P>
<P>Our hero readily perceived, that the misfortunes which he had experienced, were by no means equal to tho&s;e of his friend. He highly commended Charles's re&s;olution of leaving his wife to the &s;evere la&s;hes of her own con&s;cience, which, he ob&s;erved, would probably be productive of better effects, than any corporal pun|i&s;hment that could have been de&s;ired.</P>
<P>Nothing remarkable happened in the cour&s;e of the voyage. They arrived at Quebec in May 17. After landing their troops, marines, provi&s;ions, &amp;c. Sir Guy Carlton gave orders for the &s;hips to be cleared,
<PB N="92" REF="031902_0090_0FEF3C22C98E0B80">
and repaired, if nece&s;&s;ary, and to &s;ail into a certain de|gree, and their cruize in order to intercept the French fleet. They were ready to &s;ail in &s;ixteen days. Their force con&s;i&s;ted of two fifty gun &s;hips, and three frigates, all well manned and fit for either offence or defence.</P>
<P>The captain of the Manheim, of fifty guns, dying at Quebec, Charles was appointed to the command; in con&s;equence, our hero le&s;t the I&s;is, and accompanied his friend.</P>
<P>The period was approaching, in which our two friends were to be once more &s;eparated:&mdash;The thick and gloomy clouds of adver&s;ity were already collected, &s;u&s;pended over, and ready to bur&s;t on the Briti&s;h na|tion. Fortune had lavi&s;hed her favors profu&s;ely on the king of England; but the mea&s;ure of his iniquity, be|ing full to the brim, the godde&s;s took offence at the ar|bitrary proceedings of the imperious monarch, in con|junction with Bute, North, Sandwich, and &s;everal others of the &s;ame &s;tamp, and was determined to hum|ble their arrogance, by taking into her protection the oppre&s;&s;ed, much injured Americans, who&s;e de&s;truction was meditated, and every mea&s;ure that appeared likely to effect it, adopted in London, for no other rea&s;on than that they would not tamely &s;ubmit to be plundered of the fruits of their virtuous labour.</P>
<P>This favorable turn of affairs reanimated the fainting Americans, who laboured under every di&s;advantage but want of bread, courage, and a good General.</P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="031902_0091_0FEF3C1E2B38CDD8">In England it had a different effect. The King and his &s;ycophantic train were utterly confounded; for they had never dreamt of re&s;i&s;tance in America. They ex|pected implicit obedience to their commands and de|mands, however tyrannical or unju&s;t. But the &s;equel demon&s;trated their mi&s;take; and had &s;o remarkable an effect on George, that he became in&s;ane, and it is doubt|ful whether he is yet rational or not.</P>
<P>This fleet had not cruized long before they di&s;covered five French and two Spani&s;h &s;hips of war, bearing down with crowded canvas: The two latter were in the &s;ervice of France. A council of war was immedi|ately called on board the I&s;is, wherein it was determin|ed to attack the French (they were all under French colours) as &s;oon as ever they came within gun-&s;hot. Accordingly, the nece&s;&s;ary di&s;po&s;itions being made, the two large &s;hips bore up in front, in order to &s;u&s;tain the fir&s;t &s;hock of the enemy's fire. The frigates at the &s;ame time dropt a&s;tern, with orders to act as opportunity or nece&s;&s;ity might require. Every man &s;tood at his &s;tation, with his eye fixed attentively on the approaching enemy &mdash;not a whi&s;per could be heard on board. The fleets advanced to the conflict, with &s;ilent rapid motion. What an awful &s;ituation! where thou&s;ands of human beings &s;tand on the very verge of eternity! &s;tand ready to di&s;charge the dreadful me&s;&s;engers of death among their fellow-creatures! Surrounded by the devouring ocean: Dreadful aby&s;s! &s;hocking idea!</P>
<P><PB N="94" REF="031902_0092_0FEF3B324DFC9CB8">The French commander call'd to the captain of the I&s;is to &s;trike, otherwi&s;e to expect no quarter. He an|&s;wered, that he wi&s;hed for no quarter, and that if he in|tended to capture the Engli&s;h fleet, he mu&s;t kill him fir&s;t, for he was determined never to &s;urrender while he had a living man on board. He had no &s;ooner pro|nounced the&s;e words, than he gave orders to pour in a broad&s;ide, which was performed with alacrity, and re|turned no le&s;s vigorou&s;ly. The fight &s;oon became ge|neral. Chain, grape and langridge, flew like hail. Ma&s;ts, yards, fails and &s;hattered rigging, covered the foaming &s;urface of the ocean, which, from the mo&s;t beauteous green, was converted to a crim&s;on hue.</P>
<P>The Briti&s;h tars, it mu&s;t be acknowledged, fought with unparelleled bravery. Pity it had not been in a better cau&s;e. One of the Engli&s;h frigates taking a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">van|tage of the &s;moke to leeward, ran under the &s;tern of a French &s;hip of ninety guns, poured in a heavy broad|&s;ide, which raked her fore and aft, and &s;et her on fire, which was never extingui&s;hed till &s;he was burnt down to the water. The frigate wore as &s;he di&s;charged the broad&s;ide, and recovered her po&s;ition without injury or difficulty.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t at that in&s;tant, a two and forty pounder pene|trated the Blenheim, between wind and water, and was on the point of &s;inking before the leak was di&s;co|vered&mdash;all hands were employed in repelling the com|mon enemy, and therefore paid no attention to any

thing el&s;e. At the &s;ame in&s;tant, the brave commander of the I&s;is was deprived of his head and right hand by a chain-&s;hot. Before there could be any &s;top put to the leak, the Blenheim &s;unk, having three hundred and fifty met on board. Mercutio and Charles were on the quarter-deck when it went down: The principle of &s;elf-pre&s;ervation prompted the former to &s;eize a large hen|coop, which had worked loo&s;e, by &s;ome means, &s;o that when the &s;hip &s;unk, it bore him up.</P>
<P>After having been to&s;&s;ed about for &s;ome time, in the mid&s;t of this dire conflict, he, with nine of his &s;hip|mates, was taken into a boat belonging to one of the Spani&s;h &s;hips, immediately conveyed on board and hand-cu&s;&s;ed two and two.</P>
<P>They had &s;carcely got on board, when one of the French &s;hips blew up&mdash;and while a &s;econd &s;hared a &s;imilar fate with the Blenheim, the fierce&s;t flames de|voured the &s;ails, rigging, and hull of a third. The explo&s;ion was dreadful; and a more horrid &s;cene was never de&s;cribed. Legs, arms, heads, whole bodies, blood and brains, were hurled in the air, in awful con|fu&s;ion. The di&s;tracted French &s;ailors were &s;een jump|ing into the &s;ea, to e&s;cape the more excruciating tor|ments of being con&s;umed by fire. The flames having communicated to another of the French &s;hips, which encrea&s;ed the horror of the &s;cene. The two &s;urviving &s;hips took to precipitate flight. The Engli&s;h made a feint of pur&s;uit, but being in a &s;hattered condition, gave
<PB N="96" REF="031902_0094_0FEF3C27496770B0">
a great &s;hout, accompanied with three times three cheers, hove about and let them go. On their return, they took up &s;everal of the mi&s;erable wretches that had e&s;caped the flames, and &s;ome few who had e&s;|caped from &s;inking with the Blenheim.</P>
<P>The French commander &s;teered away for Bre&s;t, and pre&s;&s;ed the Spaniard to accompany him; but he ab&s;o|lutely refu&s;ed&mdash;&s;o bore away for Bilboa, a rich &s;eaport in Spain. On their arrival, Mercutio, with his fellow-pri&s;oners, were confined in a noi&s;ome dungeon, with|out light or fre&s;h air; the damp ground for their com|mon bed, and a very &s;canty allowance of cour&s;e bread and water, for their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. In this deplorable &s;ituation, they remained for the &s;pace of three months, in which time &s;ix of the unhappy captives expired; for the horrid &s;tench of their own ordure, which was never removed during their confinement, added to their want of food and fre&s;h air, introduced a malignant di&s;ea&s;e among them, under which, tho&s;e attacked by it, lin|gered in extreme torture, about three days, and then expired. The wretched &s;urvivors, envied their de|parting fellow-&s;ufferers, and earne&s;tly invoked the powers of heaven to ha&s;ten their di&s;&s;olution&mdash;their bodies were &s;o emaciated by the combined force of grief, want and di&s;ea&s;e, that they re&s;embled &s;keletons more than living men. Mercutio, however, in &s;pite of all the&s;e, &s;u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ered nothing more than want of liberty and food; for his appetite &s;till remained, and although re|duced almo&s;t to nothing, was &s;till healthy.</P>
<P><PB N="97" REF="031902_0095_0FEF3C293827DAC0">It happened, fortunately for our hero, that a Spani&s;h nobleman having heard of the pri&s;oners, made applica|tion to the chief magi&s;trate for leave to &s;end them to his villa, in order to a&s;&s;i&s;t at digging a canal, which was already begun, through an exten&s;ive park, where a num|ber of labourers where then at work.</P>
<P>The nobleman obtained his reque&s;t, on certain con|ditions, and di&s;patched a dome&s;tic with the magi&s;trate's order to relea&s;e them. When they were brought out, and their chains taken off, they concluded, they were going to be put to death. True it is, death never received a more hearty welcome, than the&s;e men would have given him. However, this was not the ca&s;e, they were conducted immediately to the villa, whither the nobleman had already gone. When he was apprized of their arrival, he ordered them to be brought before him.</P>
<P>He was a&s;toni&s;hed at their appearance, and expre&s;&s;|ed much indignation at the treatment they had received, generou&s;ly commi&s;erated their misfortunes, and imme|diately commanded plenty of good food to be given them, after forcing them to drink a large gla&s;s of wine, each in his pre&s;ence. His orders were punctually obeyed, and two of the poor creatures in&s;tantly fell victims to the gratification of their raging appetites: They expired in &s;trong convul&s;ions, while Mercutio and the other wretched &s;urvivor, remained in&s;en&s;ible for &s;everal hours. The nobleman, however, who&s;e name was Don Diego de Guzman, &s;ent for a phy&s;ician,
<PB N="98" REF="031902_0096_0FEF3B768D37C618">
who, in a few days, by the application of &s;alutary me|dicine, and nouri&s;hing, though &s;imple food, re&s;tored them to perfect health. After being &s;haved, wa&s;hed, and putting on clean linen, they began to wear the a&s;pects of men again; but were &s;till weak.</P>
<P>They were &s;ent in company with &s;everal other la|borers to digging the canal; here, though they eat their food by the &s;weat of their brow, yet, having plenty that was good, with a quart of wine each man per day, they recovered &s;trength &s;urprizingly, and began to experi|ence much &s;atisfaction. Mercutio, had he not been greatly affected with the idea of the death of Charles, would probably have been tolerably happy; for having experienced &s;o many turns of fortune, he had become in &s;ome mea&s;ure, habituated to cro&s;&s;es and di&s;appoint|ment, and therefore, though his &s;ituation, at that time, was by no means a de&s;irable one; yet it effectually &s;e|cured him from the attacks of envy, and from falling into tho&s;e exce&s;&s;es to which young men are expo&s;ed; the effects of which, are galling remor&s;e, tormenting reflections, and very frequently, infamy. He therefore, in gratitude, returned thanks to the Supreme Di&s;|po&s;er of every event, for the mea&s;ure of contentment he &s;till po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, in the enjoyment of &s;ound and unin|terrupted health and increa&s;ing vigour.</P>
<P>Don Diego generally devoted &s;even or eight hours of each day in viewing the work and in giving directions: Though a native of old Spain, and immen&s;ely rich, yet he was neither indolent nor imperious; but com|pletely
<PB N="99" REF="031902_0097_0FEF3B4E0D4FD258">
affable and generous; in a word, &s;ympathy and benevolence characterized that noble Spaniard. He had &s;tudied the features, air, and behaviour of Mercu|tio for &s;ome time, with the mo&s;t acute attention, and rightly judging he was of no vulgar extraction, re|&s;olved to que&s;tion him on the &s;ubject. Accordingly, one day he ordered Mercutio to follow him, with his mattock, as if to do &s;omething that had been neglect|ed. Having taking him out of the fight of his fellow labourers, he made him a number of que&s;tions; &s;uch as, where he was born? how he came to be captured? &amp;c. The an&s;wer he received proved &s;o &s;atisfactory to the Don, that he began to entertain a very high opi|nion of our hero's merit, and, after a pau&s;e of &s;ome minutes, he a&s;ked him, if his liberty could be procured, whether he would be willing to &s;tay and &s;ettle in Spain? Mercutio did not refu&s;e; his an&s;wer however, was eva&s;ive. He well knew that, being at liberty, a de&s;ire of returning to his native country would inevitably predo|minate. He therefore framed his an&s;wer accordingly, and, from the &s;ucceeding circum&s;tances, we may ju&s;t|ly infer that the old Don took for granted that he in|tended to &s;tay.</P>
<P>Don Diego told him to go to his work, and left him. After the labours of the day were ended, a fe|male dome&s;tic came to Mercutio and de&s;ired him to follow her. He complied, and &s;he conducted him in|to an apartment he had never &s;een before; and, af|ter de&s;iring him to &s;it, retired. He had not been long,
<PB N="100" REF="031902_0098_0FEF31D44ADA55E8">
there before Don Diego made his appearance, and, preventing our hero from ri&s;ing, &s;at down by him.</P>
<P>Mercutio, &s;aid he, ever &s;ince I fir&s;t beheld you, I have entertained a prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion in your favour: I find that prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion has not been unju&s;tly founded. Your behaviour in the inferior &s;tation to which you have unfortunately been reduced, with the candid ac|count you have given me of your misfortunes, con|firms me in the good opinion I had conceived of you, and all the&s;e circum&s;tances have concurred to deter|mine me to &s;et you at liberty. To convince you of the &s;incerity of my profe&s;&s;ions, (here he rang a bell and a &s;ervant entered bearing a bundle, which he deli|vered to his ma&s;ter and departed) take this, &s;aid he, and with it your liberty, pre&s;enting the bundle, which contained a rich Spani&s;h habit, embroidered; and though I propo&s;ed in our conver&s;ation to day, your &s;taying in Spain, I did not intend to make that the condition of your liberty; as that would be only en|larging the place of your confinement. No, I have procured your liberty, and intend you &s;hall enjoy it in its mo&s;t exten&s;ive latitude. You are at liberty to go when and where you plea&s;e. If you choo&s;e to remain &s;ome time in Spain, my hou&s;e and my pur&s;e are at your &s;ervice.</P>
<P>Such a &s;uperior di&s;play of genero&s;ity in an utter &s;tranger, almo&s;t petrified our hero with a&s;toni&s;hment: He remained &s;ilent for &s;ome time. At length he ex|claimed,
<PB N="101" REF="031902_0099_0FEF31D79469DC50">
thanks to Heaven! Thanks to the generous, the benevolent Guzman! May that power who in|&s;pired you with the&s;e exalted &s;entiments, &s;hower down his choice&s;t ble&s;&s;ings on you, and your po&s;terity. May his mercy be liberally extended to you and them, as you have extended yours to me, exceeding my mo&s;t &s;anguine wi&s;hes! Command my life! It's at your &s;er|vice&mdash;there is no injunction, con&s;i&s;tent with religion and honour, you are capable of laying on me, that I can, or will, refu&s;e to my generous deliverer&mdash;here he was interrupted by the Don. Mercutio, &s;aid he, I am already more than recompenced in the real plea|&s;ure I derived from a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of having, in this in&s;tance, performed my duty. It argues a &s;ordid, con|tracted mind, &s;uch as I hope the natives of Spain are &s;trangers to&punc; to confer a favour in hopes of retalia|tion: So I de&s;ire whatever thanks the effu&s;ions of your gratitude may in&s;pire, may be directed to that Fountain of benevolence, who has commanded us to love one another, and who graciou&s;ly inforced the precept by his own glorious example.&mdash;You will &s;up with me to night, and if you would oblige me, dive&s;t your&s;elf of all re&s;traint; treating me in all re&s;pects as if we were &s;ons of the &s;ame father. To-morrow I will give you a more convincing proof of my e&s;teem: Which is greater, perhaps, than you expect. Thus this di&s;intere&s;ted Spaniard &s;uppre&s;&s;ed the ardent ac|knowledgments which our hero was about to make, and which all mankind would allow him as ju&s;tly his due: De&s;iring nothing but an approving con&s;cience,
<PB N="102" REF="031902_0100_0FEF320BE9390A20">
and wi&s;hing to a&s;cribe all the merit of the action to the Author of all good.&mdash;He then introduced our hero to Donna Belvidera, his wife, a per&s;on of con&s;ummate beauty and good &s;en&s;e, by whom he was treated with all imaginable re&s;pect. The Don had two daughters, who were accounted beauties, but they never appear|ed before Mercutio unveiled. After one month's re|&s;idence there, no opportunity offering of procuring a pa&s;&s;age to England, he re&s;olved to take the advantage of the Don's proffer, and, having an inclination to go to Barcelona the capital of Catalonia, noted for its trade, riches and beauty, informed him of his in|tention. He in&s;tantly acquie&s;ced, and, taking him in|to his clo&s;et, unlocked his bureau and taking out a a pur&s;e containing 200 johannes, pre&s;ented them to him, &s;aying, I in&s;i&s;t on your acceptance of this trifle, as a farther token of my e&s;teem for you: It may per|haps be &s;erviceable to you in your tour, in which I heartily with you genuine &s;atisfaction: Barcelona is a beautiful city, and one of the riche&s;t in the Spani&s;h dominions. I &s;hall expect to hear from you in the cour&s;e of two months, for you may re&s;t a&s;&s;ured I am much intere&s;ted in your welfare; and &s;hall take a plea&s;ure in hearing of your health and pro&s;perity.</P>
<P>Our hero was about to make a proper acknowledg|ment for this and every other favor he had received at his hands, but was prevented by the Don's begging to be excu&s;ed for that time, as he was obliged to meet &s;ome gentlemen on an important occa&s;ion. This put
<PB N="103" REF="031902_0101_0FEF320DC1EAA190">
an end to to the conference, and Mercutio began to prepare for his intended journey. Having procured a good hor&s;e, and being properly equipped, he took leave of the old Don and his lady, who did not part without regret, and &s;et forward attended by a hired &s;er|vant, mounted on a mule, a bea&s;t more frequently made u&s;e of there than a hor&s;e.</P>
<P>He made no delay, but kept &s;teadily forward until he arrived at Barcelona, where he lodged &s;ome days at an inn, until he could procure accommodation in a pri|vate hou&s;e, which be&s;t &s;uited his di&s;po&s;ition. He went one day into a jeweller's &s;hop, to look at &s;ome trinkets, as well as to enquire for a convenient lodging; and after &s;ome di&s;cour&s;e with the jeweller, who was a very jo|cular per&s;on, and &s;poke tolerable Engli&s;h, received an invitation to dine. He accepted the invitation, and was conducted to an elegant back apartment, where his wife and four fine children were &s;itting. When the lady was informed that our hero was from London, &s;he ro&s;e and gave him a very cordial reception, as &s;he was a native of that city her&s;elf. Their conver&s;ation became general till dinner was &s;erved up. They in|formed Mercutio, that they were married in London, and had lived and carried on bu&s;ine&s;s near three years; but the father of the jeweller dying, he was obliged to return to Barcelona, to &s;ettle his affairs and take po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of the e&s;tate. The jeweller further informed him, that he re&s;ided four years in London prior to his marriage, in which time he had embraced the Prote&s;tant

faith, and added, that he was determined to return to that city, as &s;oon as the war with America was at an end; as he found it very difficult to di&s;gui&s;e his religi|ous &s;entiments, though he u&s;ed the utmo&s;t precaution for that purpo&s;e&mdash;which line of conduct he conjured our hero to pur&s;ue as he valued his life.</P>
<P>He &s;pent the evening with his new acquired friends, much to his &s;atisfaction; and as they had a couple of rooms unoccupied, Mercutio hired them for him&s;elf and &s;ervant. He took leave late in the evening, and the next morning, di&s;charged his reckoning at the inn, and after providing for the accommodation of his cattle, removed to his new lodging.</P>
<P>Here he began again to ta&s;te the &s;weets of &s;ociety; his ho&s;t and ho&s;te&s;s being perfectly frank, &s;ocial and generous, which rendered his &s;ituation very comforta|ble&mdash;his kind country-woman propo&s;ed a &s;eparate table for him; but he reque&s;ted as a favor, to be permitted to eat and drink with her and her hu&s;band. This was agreed on, and they enjoyed much &s;atisfaction in the &s;ociety of each other. During his re&s;idence at this place, he vi&s;ited every place of polite entertainment and re&s;ort in that beautiful and opulent city, by which means he contracted an acquaintance with &s;everal young Spaniards of di&s;tinction; &s;ome of whom pro|fe&s;&s;ed a very great friend&s;hip for him; but among all tho&s;e, none had &s;o great a &s;hare of the e&s;teem of our hero, as Don Alonzo, a young Ca&s;tilian nobleman,

who inherited the mo&s;t happy di&s;po&s;ition: To a very regular &s;et of features, and genteel &s;hape, he added an agreeable and graceful deportment&mdash;his judgment was found, and his conver&s;ation animating, mode&s;t and plea&s;ing. He had ju&s;t arrived at Barcelona, after a re&s;idence of two whole years in the capital of France, that mart of vivacity and politene&s;s, &s;o that he retained none of that imperious &s;tiffne&s;s of a Spaniard&mdash;neither had he acquired the extreme volatility which character|izes the French; but that happy medium, which ren|dered his company very de&s;irable.</P>
<P>Alonzo profe&s;&s;ed every &s;entiment of re&s;pect for our hero, who fell nothing &s;hort, &s;o that in a little time a reciprocal attachment took place between them, which rendered their walks, recreations, and intere&s;ts of every kind in&s;eparable.</P>
<P>Alonzo had a very exten&s;ive acquaintance, to whom at different times, he introduced Mercutio as a re&s;pect|ed friend; by which means, he became, as it were, naturalized;&mdash;and as he &s;poke the Spani&s;h language fluently, his company was courted by all the mo&s;t no|ble Spaniards in Barcelona.</P>
<P>Our hero with his friend Alonzo, and &s;everal other per&s;ons of di&s;tinction, made an appointment to divert them&s;elves in cha&s;ing the wild-boar, a kind of exerci&s;e common in that country. The company met accord|ing to appointment, and &s;et forward in high &s;pirits to

the chace. The dogs beat the low grounds for &s;ome time, and at length rou&s;ed an amazing large boar.</P>
<P>The foaming bea&s;t took to an adjacent mountain, and a&s;cended it &s;wiftly. They pur&s;ued him vigorou&s;ly over the &s;ame; but on de&s;cending the other &s;ide, which was very &s;teep and craggy, Mercutio's hor&s;e was &s;tung &s;o &s;everely by a tarantula, that he bounded &s;uddenly over a &s;harp ridge of a rock, by which he di&s;mounted his rider, though an excellent hor&s;eman. This unlucky accident put an end to the &s;port, and threw the re&s;t of the company in the utmo&s;t con&s;ternation. Every one di&s;mounted in&s;tantly, and ran to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance. On examining, they found his right arm broke, and his &s;houlder di&s;located. Alonzo mounted his hor&s;e and ran, or rather flew to a &s;mall village, which lay conti|guous to the foot of the mountain, for a &s;urgeon, who dwelt there, and begging his attendance immediately, went out and procured a hor&s;e for him, in order to acce|lerate his &s;peed, which he had brought to the door ju&s;t as the &s;urgeon had his dre&s;&s;ings and implements ready &mdash;They &s;oon arrived at the &s;pot where he was lying in extreme pain. Alonzo immediately gave him a large gla&s;s of cordial, which greatly revived his &s;pirits. The &s;urgeon then got him removed to a convenient place, and ordered a palanquin to be &s;ent for immediately, to convey him to the neare&s;t hou&s;e, where accommodation could be procured, after the opperation of &s;etting was performed. Mercutio's &s;er|vant was di&s;patched on this bu&s;ine&s;s in&s;tantly, as there

was not one to be had nearer than Barcelona, which was full &s;even Engli&s;h miles.</P>
<P>The &s;urgeon, who was eminent in his profe&s;&s;ion, hav|ing examined, &s;et, and bound up his arm and &s;houlder in an exceeding tender manner, told him he need not be un|der any apprehen&s;ion, as he would pledge his life for the performance of the cure in the &s;pace of four weeks, with God's a&s;&s;i&s;tance, if he followed his directions. The young gentleman, &s;aid he, turning to the company, mu&s;t be carefully removed to &s;ome hou&s;e as near as po&s;&s;ible. A young Spaniard, one of the company, who&s;e father's &s;eat lay but a &s;mall di&s;tance from the mountain, propo&s;ed his being removed thither, where, he ob&s;erved, he &s;hould be carefully attended, until his cure &s;hould be effected. Mercutio, who by this time, was con&s;iderably relieved from his pain, returned him thanks for his kindne&s;s; but a&s;ked the &s;urgeon, if he might not be removed to Barcelona, without danger, and being an&s;wered in the negative, gratefully accepted the offer.</P>
<P>The &s;ervant having exerted all his &s;peed, &s;oon return|ed, followed by a couple of brawny fellows, bearing a palanquin, in which Mercutio was immediately placed, in an ea&s;y po&s;ition, and conveyed to the gentleman's hou&s;e. The &s;on having rode on before to inform his father, who&s;e name was Don Ferdinando de Ca&s;tigni, of the accident.</P>
<P><PB N="108" REF="031902_0106_0FEF3C3BBB2140B8">The old gentleman met the re&s;t of the company at the gate, gave them a cordial welcome, &s;aid he was &s;orry for the unfortunate interruption in their amu&s;e|ment, and that nothing &s;hould be deficient on his part to render the time of the young gentleman's &s;tay in his hou&s;e, as ea&s;y and agreeable as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>Mercutio was taken out of the palanquin and put to bed, and the &s;urgeon having de&s;ired him to be compo&s;ed, till the morning, took his leave, as did al&s;o the re&s;t of the company, except Alonzo, who did not leave the hou&s;e that night.</P>
<P>Our hero was ble&s;&s;ed with a good night's re&s;t: His friend Alonzo had been twice at his bed-&s;ide in the morning before he awoke&mdash;the third time finding him awake, eagerly enquired how he had re&s;ted. He an|&s;wered, that he had never re&s;ted better in his life; add|ing that he had not felt the lea&s;t pain, &s;ince he had laid down.</P>
<P>The &s;urgeon appearing &s;oon after, dre&s;&s;ed his &s;houl|der, but did not open the bandage of his arm, &s;aying he would let it remain till the evening of the en&s;uing day; and a&s;&s;ured him, if he kept him&s;elf &s;till, he was not afraid but he &s;hould be ab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e to perfect the cure in fifteen days.</P>
<P>Alonzo &s;at with him the greate&s;t part of that day: In the afternoon he took leave, with a promi&s;e to &s;ee
<PB N="109" REF="031902_0107_0FEF3C3D88516118">
him early next morning. Mercutio parted with him reluctantly, as he was not intimately acquainted with young de Ca&s;tigni. However, he did not want for company in Alonzo's ab&s;ence; for the old Don and his &s;on, &s;at with him, until they conceived it time for him to repo&s;e.</P>
<P>Not a day pa&s;&s;ed that he had not two or three of his friends to vi&s;it him. In &s;hort he was as well attended, during the three weeks that he was under the &s;urgeon's hands, as he could po&s;&s;ibly have been in England. His arm was re&s;tored to its proper &s;hape and vigour, for which he liberally rewarded his &s;urgeon.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as he was able to leave his chamber, he made an apology to the old Don and his lady, for the trouble his unlucky fall had made in their hou&s;e, and at the &s;ame time returning his mo&s;t unfeigned thanks for the generous and polite attention he had received during the time he had re&s;ided with them. Don de Ca&s;tigini prevented him from proceeding any further, by &s;aying, "Come, come, Sir, I reque&s;t you will &s;ay no more on this &s;ubject&mdash;humanity is a duty incumbent on every per&s;on who profe&s;&s;es chri&s;tianity; to have done le&s;s, for a per&s;on in the &s;ituation you were when fir&s;t introduced here, would have di&s;clo&s;ed a very callous heart, an unchri&s;tian-like di&s;po&s;ition, that would di&s;|grace a Heathen, and con&s;equently beneath a Chri&s;tian. But, however, as I &s;ee you are de&s;irous of making a &s;uitable return for the little &s;ervice you have received

in my hou&s;e, I will &s;oon give you an opportunity of di&s;playing your gratitude to advantage." Make your own conditions, replied Mercutio, and you &s;hall &s;ee with what willingne&s;s, I will hazard my life, if re|quired, in the &s;ervice of my generous and kind benefactor. "Well then," rejoined the Don, "the condition is this: That you will favor us with your company fourteen days at lea&s;t. This is all I a&s;k, and after your profe&s;&s;ions of gratitude, I expect you will not refu&s;e me the favor."</P>
<P>To this he very willingly agreed, and the Don in|troduced him to his three daughters, whom he had ne|ver before &s;een. They were all beautiful, and each of them attired in a rich Spani&s;h undre&s;s, of blue &s;atin, &s;pangled with &s;ilver. The two elde&s;t were a little in|clined to brown, though beautifully featured; but the younge&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed all the beauty that could po&s;&s;ibly be comprized in one woman. They drop<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> their veils when Mercutio entered the apartment with their father; but he ordered them to unveil, and conver&s;e without re&s;erve, as though no &s;tranger was pre&s;ent.

He returned their compliments in a very mode&s;t, be|coming &s;tyle.</P>
<P>They had ju&s;t &s;eated them&s;elves, when Alonzo and young Ferdinando entered. After mutual &s;alutations
<PB N="111" REF="031902_0109_0FEF3C4500CEE0F0">
and congratulations had pa&s;&s;ed between them, they en|tered into an animated &s;train of conver&s;ation, where|in the young ladies bore a di&s;tingui&s;hed part. The agreeable and pertinent remarks which, with the mo&s;t engaging mode&s;ty they expre&s;&s;ed, afforded Mercutio the mo&s;t &s;uperior &s;atisfaction. Donna I&s;abella, the younge&s;t daughter, who&s;e per&s;onal charms were, though matchle&s;s, totally eclip&s;ed by the real and more la&s;ting beauties of her mind, made an impre&s;&s;ion on the heart of our hero, not ea&s;ily de&s;cribed. To the mo&s;t happy turn of wit, &s;he united the &s;weete&s;t tem|per, and the mo&s;t critical propriety of &s;peech: All the&s;e amiable qualifications rendered her conver&s;ation delighting. 'Twas this captivated Mercutio. When I&s;abella took any part in the conver&s;ation, he was in extacy; with the mo&s;t profound attention he li&s;ten|ed to the enchanting accents &s;he pronounced, and when &s;he cea&s;ed to &s;peak, pre&s;erved his attentive at|titude, as if petrified with plea&s;ure by the ravi&s;hing &s;ound.</P>
<P>A collation was &s;erved up, con&s;i&s;ting of the luxu|ries of Europe; which was followed by a de&s;ert of the choice&s;t viands of Spain, and the evening was &s;pent in the mo&s;t undi&s;&s;embled mirth and hilarity; Don Ferdinando him&s;elf being a very &s;ocial per&s;on, his frank and affable behaviour con&s;iderably augmented the &s;atisfaction of the whole company.</P>
<P><PB N="112" REF="031902_0110_0FEF3C47A6E7ABC8">The next day, our hero wrote to his friend and be|nefactor, Don Guzman, at Bilboa: His letter contain|ed a mo&s;t grateful acknowledgment of the obligations he lay under to him&mdash;an account of the accident he had met with, and his recovery, and concluded with a promi&s;e to &s;ee him in a &s;hort time, being determined to &s;et out for Bilboa in a few days.</P>
<P>Though Mercutio certainly intended to fulfil his pro|mi&s;e in its fulle&s;t extent, yet he &s;oon found (what he might be &s;uppo&s;ed to have been well acquainted with before) that nothing earthly is entitled to our confi|dence; but that all our actions are guided by an in|vi&s;ible power; and that however flattering our future pro&s;pect may appear to our partial fight, or however near, yet the clouds of di&s;appointment and adver&s;ity, which are driven about by the uncertain gales of for|tune, may intervene and deprive us of the glittering phantom, if not forever, at lea&s;t for a &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>It was with the utmo&s;t reluctance that Don Ferdi|nando and his family permitted our hero to depart, af|ter a &s;tay of twenty four days, nor then, without the mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ing invitations to pay them another vi&s;it &s;hortly. A &s;trict regard to truth con&s;trained him to in|form them of his intention of leaving Spain very &s;oon. This information had a remarkable effect on the coun|tenance of Donna I&s;abella. Mercutio, however, in compliance with the reque&s;t of the whole family, pro|mi&s;ed to pay them a parting vi&s;it.</P>
<P><PB N="113" REF="031902_0111_0FEF3C4A6012AD98">The countenance of I&s;abella re&s;umed its wonted &s;erenity, and they took a cheerful and friendly leave of each other; he returned to Barcelona, accompanied by Alonzo and young Ferdinando. His kind ho&s;t and his wife were happy in &s;eeing him &s;afe again, and, in te&s;|timony of the plea&s;ure they derived from his return, devoted the day to mirth and good cheer: The only thing that occurred to damp their joy, was the reflec|tion of &s;o &s;oon parting with Mercutio: However, they &s;pent the day very agreeably. In the evening, Alonzo and his friend took an affectionate leave of our hero, and his ho&s;t, and departed. Mercutio hav|ing retired to his apartment, began to reflect on the long &s;eries of adventures he had run through &s;ince his departure from his native country, which appeared like a cha&s;m in his life: The re&s;ult was, he re&s;olved to &s;tay about one week longer in Barcelona, take leave of his friends there, and return to Bilboa, where he intended to take &s;hipping for England. But alas, how vain are the re&s;olutions of man! When the idea of taking leave of Ca&s;tigni's family pre&s;ented it&s;elf, the image of the charming I&s;abella, arrayed in all the charms peculiar to innocence, youth, and beauty, di&s;|&s;olving in tears at the &s;eparation, accompanied it. However, as he &s;uppo&s;ed his heart was entirely di&s;en|gaged, he per&s;i&s;ted in his re&s;olution, and under this impre&s;&s;ion endeavoured to compo&s;e him&s;elf to re&s;t, but in vain, the plea&s;ing phantom was &s;till vi&s;ible to the eye of his imagination; all his reflections &s;erved but to increa&s;e his perplexity; nor could he &s;leep until Au|rora

<P>We find, from her own confe&s;&s;ion, that &s;he pa&s;&s;ed that night in no le&s;s perplexity than Mercutio. When &s;he anticipated the fatal, approaching day which was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o &s;eparate her from him for ever, her tender bo&s;om &s;welled with &s;ighs; and &s;he wet her pillow with her tears. Oh! &s;he would exclaim, how unhappy am I! Though I enjoy all the advantages of birth, fortune, and education, yet my prophetic &s;oul forbodes my future mi&s;ery. I love Mercutio, yet he is ignorant of it! What then? Perhaps if he was convinced of the love I bear him, he would not have it in his power to extricate me from the wretchedne&s;s which awaits me, or which would complete my mi&s;ery. Perhaps &s;ome Engli&s;h beauty is now impatiently waiting his return, to crown her happine&s;s by fulfilling the ten|der engagements he entered into, when they parted. And yet, my eyes deceived me, or I ob&s;erved &s;omething like embarra&s;&s;ment in his countenance to day, at parting. But what will that avail me? It may be, if unen|gaged el&s;ewhere, he has become enamoured with one of my &s;i&s;ters:&mdash;There ruin &s;tares me in the face again! Would to heaven I was acquainted with

<P>Mercutio aro&s;e without that tr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">quillity of mind with which he had been ble&s;t for a con&s;iderable time before. He concealed his unea&s;ine&s;s from his kind ho&s;t and lady during the time they &s;at at breakfa&s;t; and afterwards dre&s;t, and walked out to one of tho&s;e delightful gardens which are adorned with all the beauties of nature and of art, and are fitted for the entertainment and reception of per&s;ons of quality only. He walked about, mu&s;ing on the vi&s;ion of the preceding night, for &s;ome time. He reflected that the pa&s;&s;ion which he had conceived was as yet but in embryo, and might be ea&s;ily eradi|cated. Be&s;ides he had no foundation to build his hope on, if he &s;hould cheri&s;h it. When he con&s;idered the di&s;|appointments and dangers he had already experienced, the lo&s;&s;es he had &s;u&s;tained, and the depths of mi&s;ery to which he had been reduced, in con&s;equence of his pa&s;t amours, he re&s;olved to abandon an enterprize which appeared to be fraught with hazard and mani|fe&s;t difficulty. He became cheerful again, and de|termined

to leave Barcelona, in a very few days. At dinner he communicated his intention to his ho&s;t, without the lea&s;t hint of the rea&s;on of &s;o precipitate a retreat.

<P>In the morning he &s;et out, on hor&s;e back, attend|ed by a &s;ervant. He was received with the &s;ame degree of kindne&s;s, which he had uniformly expe|rienced in that family.

The lovely I&s;abella, who&s;e heart, tender as the orb of &s;ight, had caught the &s;weet infection, was &s;eized, when he took her hand, with a &s;udden tremor, which thrilled like lightning through the deepe&s;t, and mo&s;t intricate rece&s;&s;es of it.&mdash;In vain &s;he endeavoured to conceal the palpi|tation of her convul&s;ed brea&s;t&mdash;to withhold the &s;peed of the glittering globes of chry&s;tal which privately &s;tole down her blu&s;hing cheeks,&mdash;Cupid had planted one of his keene&s;t darts in her un<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ullied brea&s;t, and &s;he tacitly confe&s;&s;ed it.

He eagerly em|braced the offer: The more &s;o, as it might convince her of the rectitude of his intentions. Thither, then, he was immediately conducted.

She brightened at this a&s;&s;urance, and he be|gan to paint the obligations he lay under to her father, in the mo&s;t &s;triking colours. He then expatiated largely on the blackne&s;s of ingratitude; and concluded, by declaring the fervency of his love for her, which be &s;aid was heightened by the reflection of her being a daughter of the generous De Ca&s;tigni; but added, that whatever &s;teps a &s;en&s;e of her di&s;tre&s;s might prompt him to take in her behalf, he was determined to take none that &s;hould be di&s;honorable to him&s;elf; or by which he might forfeit the e&s;teem of her noble father: "Such a &s;tep," continued he, "would render me unworthy of your confidence."</P>
<P>Our Hero expected the latter part of his declaration would have been a little unwelcome to I&s;abella; but in this he was mi&s;taken: She told him &s;he abhor|ed the very idea of purcha&s;ing happine&s;s at the ex|pence of his honor or integrity, adding, if &s;he could have harboured the mo&s;t di&s;tant thought of his being capable of acting in a manner unworthy of a gentle|man, &s;he &s;hould never have acted the part &s;he had.</P>

Though a thou|&s;and different ideas crowded his imagination at fir&s;t, yet, when he compared all the circum&s;tances; view|ed the matter in every light in which it was capa|ble of being viewed, he re&s;olved no longer to refu&s;e a happine&s;s, which, by the long concatenation of events that had accompanied it, appeared to be

the immediate gift of Heaven: But to ri&s;que every thing in e&s;tabli&s;hing that happine&s;s which involved his own. He embraced her with ardor, and exclaim|ed, "Is Heaven then propitious to my wi&s;hes! And am I at la&s;t to obtain that trea&s;ure, which is of greater e&s;timation than the glittering mines of Col|con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ia! A trea&s;ure of which kings would boa&s;t with rapture!"&mdash;Here &s;he interrupted him by ob&s;erving, that her mother and the Reverend Father had maturely weighed every circum&s;tance; that he conceived the Italian, having taken an undue advantage of a ra&s;h vow, made in the effu&s;ions of gratitude, his claim had neither religion, rea&s;on, nor ju&s;tice for its foun|dation, and con&s;equently was null to all intents and purpo&s;es; that if a countermine could be effected, it would not only be blamele&s;s, but meritorious: As the temporal, and, perhaps, eternal happine&s;s of I&s;a|bella was deeply concerned, it behoved them to prevent, if po&s;&s;ible, a union fraught with &s;o many evils and inconveniencies. They al&s;o agreed that to deceive the Italian, without the knowledge or concurrence of the Don would be laudable, for the rea&s;ons above men|tioned.</P>
<P>Our hero then enquired if &s;he had &s;een her brother &s;ince her arrival in town, &s;he an&s;wered in the affirma|tive, and that he &s;hould &s;ee him &s;hortly. She then rang a &s;mall bell, and Tere&s;a, her maid, appeared: She told her to inform her aunt and brother that &s;he wi&s;hed the favor of their company. In a few minutes
<PB N="128" REF="031902_0126_0FEF3C754ECB0878">
they entered, accompanied by the holy Father, a per|&s;on truly reverend in his appearance, the &s;erenity of who&s;e countenance &s;poke the goodne&s;s and tranquillity of his &s;oul.</P>
<P>After mutual &s;alutations. I&s;abella with her aunt re|tired into a clo&s;et; when the prie&s;t began a very pious and edifying di&s;cour&s;e, in the cour&s;e of which he made &s;everal pertinent allu&s;ions to the cau&s;e of their meeting. He animadverted freely, and with great ingenuity on the impropriety of ha&s;ty marriages, unequal matches, ra&s;h promi&s;es, &amp;c. and concluded by urging in a very pathetic manner, the nece&s;&s;ity of the approaching union, as the lives, and what was of infinitely more value, the happine&s;s of the mother and daughter, wholly depended on its con&s;ummation. He next enjoined our hero to write a letter to his intended father-in-law, containing an ample account of the whole affair&mdash;promi&s;ing to take charge of it him&s;elf, and deliver it to the Don, after preparing him for the reception of the news. This Mercutio promi&s;ed to do. They were then re-joined by the old lady, leading forward I&s;abella, the cheerful|ne&s;s of who&s;e lovely countenance but faintly typified the exqui&s;ite felicity of her &s;oul, which heightened her charms to a degree &s;carcely inferior to ab&s;olute perfec|tion.</P>
<P>The ceremony was dignified by the &s;incere devotion with which it was performed. The old lady, for the fir&s;t time, performed the part of a mother, and young

Ferdinando that of a father, in conferring on Mercutio a trea&s;ure which he would not have exchanged for the empire of the univer&s;e. The ceremony over, the prie&s;t and Ferdinando took leave under a promi&s;e of taking breakfa&s;t with the bride and her hu&s;band the next morning.</P>
<P>The hour for repo&s;e arriving, the old lady conducted her niece to a proper apartment, and retired, leaving her under the conduct of her maid&punc; as the bu&s;ine&s;s of a bride-maid having never fell within her &s;phere.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t thing that occupied our hero's attention in the morning, was a letter to his father-in-law, which he penned agreeable to his promi&s;e, informing him of the ri&s;e, progre&s;s and con&s;ummation of his pre&s;ent happine&s;s: Explaining, in the mo&s;t re&s;pectful terms, the motives of his conduct, and humbly reque&s;ted him to pardon a crime which originated merely from a wi&s;h to re&s;tore to happine&s;s a family, for every branch of which he entertained the highe&s;t &s;entiments of gratitude and e&s;teem. After fini&s;hing this letter, he wrote another to his old benefactor at Bilboa.</P>
<P>The prie&s;t and Ferdinando kept their appointment, and they all breakfa&s;ted together very cheerfully; the former, having taken charge of the letter, and wi&s;h|ing our hero and his bri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e a great deal of happine&s;s, departed. Mercutio then informed his wife and friends his wi&s;h to embark for Holland as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible.
<PB N="130" REF="031902_0128_0FEF3C7C98D1BAB0">
They were well plea&s;ed with the information, and Fer|dinando promi&s;ed to &s;pend every evening with them, until their embarkation, and to &s;ee them &s;afe on board. He then took leave and Mercutio went in &s;earch of the Dutch captain. He found him, and agreed immedi|ately for their pa&s;&s;age. The captain propo&s;ed &s;ailing the next day, as he had to touch at Mar&s;eilles for &s;ome lading; and ob&s;erved, that if he thought proper to wait his return to Barcelona, he would lay too and take them in. This propo&s;al, however, did not exactly tally with the circum&s;tances of our hero; he therefore, made a virtue of nece&s;&s;ity, and told the captain he had &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s at Mar&s;eilles him&s;elf, and was re&s;olved to embark very early the next morning. They parted, and our hero immediately returned to inform I&s;abella of his determination. He next went to his lodgings, in order to &s;atisfy his ho&s;t, as well as to di&s;charge his &s;ervant and di&s;po&s;e of his hor&s;e. As the &s;ervant in|tended to return to Bilboa, he committed the letter for Guzman to his care, which he promi&s;ed to deliver &s;afe; and then pre&s;enting him the mule he had rode to Bilboa, the &s;ervant departed, very grateful for the liberal treatment he had received.</P>
<P>Our hero di&s;po&s;ed of his hor&s;e to his landlord, and having taken a parting bottle together, he took a final leave of them, and returned to the impatient I&s;abella, who was afraid &s;ome unlucky accident would yet inter|vene to &s;eparate them; &s;he was, therefore, naturally anxious to leave Barcelona with all po&s;&s;ible &s;peed.</P>

<P>Before the day dawned, Mercutio and his brother-in-law walked down to the water &s;ide, as the former had appointed to meet the &s;hip's boat at that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">our. In the interim, I&s;abella waited on her aunt in her bed-chamber, who immediately aro&s;e at the &s;ound of her opening the door, and taking her niece by the hand, led her to a cabinet, from which &s;he took a ca&s;ket, and pre&s;enting it to her, &s;aid: "Accept this, my dear I&s;abella, as a token of my love to you and my dear &s;i&s;ter. May you be happy! Perhaps I &s;hall never &s;ee you more. Your father, when informed of the inno|cent deceit that has been practiced on him, will, I am convinced, &s;earch you out."</P>
<P>Ju&s;t then the men returned, and the boat being wait|ing, they made ready in&s;tantly; then taking an affection|ate farewel, but not without tears on the part of the women, they &s;et forward. Their baggage, was not very bulky, con&s;i&s;ting chiefly of money and jewels, was ea&s;ily carried to the water &s;ide by our hero and Fer|dinando, who was re&s;olved to &s;ee them &s;afe on board. Preparations were making for weighing the anchor,
<PB N="132" REF="031902_0130_0FEF3C82EA4044D8">
when they came on board, where the captain welcom|ed them heartily, and conducted them to a very com|modious cabin, which had been cleared out and fitted for their reception. The wind being favorable, the captain left them in order to get the &s;hip under way as quick as po&s;&s;ible. The &s;ails &s;et, and every thing put in order, he returned to the cabin, and informed Ferdinando that the &s;hip's boat was ready to put him on &s;hore, he took an affectionate leave of his &s;i&s;ter and her hu&s;band, and returned to Barcelona.</P>
<P>Our voyagers were &s;avored with a gentle breeze for &s;ome days, during which time they enjoyed as much happine&s;s as their &s;ituation could po&s;&s;ibly afford. They happened to have a couple of French gentlemen and a very agreeable young lady of the &s;ame nation, which greatly encrea&s;ed their &s;atisfaction. Social harmony, and convivial friend&s;hip were imparted from brea&s;t to brea&s;t, and uninterrupted tranquillity, a nece&s;&s;ary con&s;e|quence of that friend&s;hip, &s;eemed to be e&s;tabli&s;hed on a permanent ba&s;is.

cu&s;tom, become le&s;s irk&s;ome, nay, in a certain degree, natural; and the angui&s;h of grief dimini&s;hes in propor|tion to the length of its continuance.</P>
<P>Their tranquillity was not of long continuance, for when they were within two days &s;ail of Mar&s;eilles, they were overtaken by a dreadful hurricane, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by a &s;trong current &s;itting out of the gulph of Lyons, which threatened the total de&s;truction of the &s;hip, and all on board. The wind blew with irre&s;i&s;table violence, which carried away the fore-top-ma&s;t and bow&s;prit in the be|ginning of the &s;torm, and at length grew &s;o furious, that the main-ma&s;t went by the board, at the &s;ame in|&s;tant the tiller-rope breaking, the man at the helm was knocked overboard; and it was at the manife&s;t hazard of their lives that the whole crew ventured to &s;eize the tiller and bend new ropes to it.</P>
<P>Con&s;ternation and horror pervaded the minds as well as countenances of all on board, under a firm per|&s;ua&s;ion of being &s;hortly buried in the capacious womb of the tremendous deep. Fortunately the &s;hip hull had &s;uffered no damage, for the ma&s;ts and yards which had been carried away, fell clear of the gunwale, and the rigging was immediately cut away. But as hope is generally the la&s;t thing that for&s;akes us, &s;o they did not ab&s;olutely de&s;pair, till after enduring the fury of the &s;torm for three days and as many nights, they found the &s;hip hurled, by the combined force of wind and waves, &s;tern foremo&s;t into a cavity between two huge rocks, where &s;he remained immoveably fixed.&mdash;

De&s;pair at la&s;t &s;tared them in the face!&mdash;Dreadful &s;itu|ation!&mdash;The &s;hip's keel was jammed in between the rocks, from which no mortal &s;trength or &s;kill could extricate it:&mdash;Surrounded by the foaming waves, which were hurled about in horrible confu&s;ion, by the yet un|abated fury of the tempe&s;t, they all betook them&s;elves to fervent prayer, and in&s;tant preparation for eternity! for death appeared inevitable. De&s;pair was &s;trongly depicted in the faces of the mariners, and every hope of &s;etting foot on &s;hore again had fled.</P>
<P>Five days and nights they remained in this horrid &s;ituation, and the major part of their provi&s;ion, particu|larly bread, was rendered u&s;ele&s;s, the water being &s;ix feet deep in the hold; however, they made very little u&s;e of what they had&mdash;they eat little, &s;lept le&s;s, and in all re&s;pects conducted them&s;elves as per&s;ons hourly ex|pecting death.</P>
<P>Mercutio's concern for I&s;abella triumphed over every other con&s;ideration; his expectations of relief were exhau&s;ted, he went &s;eldom on deck, &s;ince a&s;&s;i&s;tance had become u&s;ele&s;s. The two Frenchmen, from &s;imilar motives, remained con&s;tantly below, the one being the hu&s;band and the other the brother of the French lady: They found it an arduous ta&s;k to keep her in any tolera|ble degree of &s;pirits; but it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed I&s;abella &s;upported her fate with a fortitude that would have re|flected honor on philo&s;ophy it&s;elf. About eleven o'clock, on the fifth night of their extreme di&s;tre&s;s, the wind &s;hifted, and blew &s;o violent, that the waves rolled

in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion over this devoted &s;hip and crew. Their ears were at the &s;ame time a&s;&s;ailed with the mo&s;t &s;hock|ing peals of thunder, and terrifying fla&s;hes of ethereal fire&mdash;floods of rain and re&s;i&s;tle&s;s gu&s;ts of wind roared in concert&mdash;the whole exhibited a &s;cene of terror which would baffle every attempt to de&s;cribe.</P>
<P>As the &s;tern of the ve&s;&s;el lay con&s;iderably higher than the head, the cabins and &s;teerage were yet clear of water; the captain, his officers and pa&s;&s;engers occu|pied the former, and the common &s;ailors the latter. About day-break the &s;torm began to abate, and by nine o'clock, they were ble&s;t with a pro&s;pect of a calm &s;ea and a clear &s;ky. This, hopele&s;s as their &s;ituation was, afforded them a tran&s;itory ce&s;&s;ation of grief, during which they all bent in gratitude to that Omnipotent Power, who had mercifully &s;tayed the fury of the wind, and awed the boi&s;terous waves into &s;ubjection.</P>
<P>Though this change in the weather had in &s;ome mea&s;ure alleviated their di&s;tre&s;s, yet the cutting reflec|tion on their &s;ituation, produced pangs of the mo&s;t ex|cruciating woe: The beauteous pro&s;pect by which they were &s;urrounded, &s;erved but to in&s;pire them with the dreadful idea of &s;oon terminating their days by fa|mine. In this &s;tate of horrid anxiety, they &s;at as if benumbed and &s;tupid, until the captain broke the mournful &s;ilence in the following manner:</P>

<P>They li&s;tened with rapture to what he &s;aid, and eagerly demanded, what foundation he had to hope for what to them appeared to exceed the utmo&s;t &s;tretch of human probability? "Why, my friends," rejoined the captain, "the &s;ea is now calm, and the &s;ky clear, I will take an ob&s;ervation, by which means I &s;hall be able to a&s;certain the be&s;t cour&s;e to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">eer to make the neare&s;t land."</P>
<P>The captain found by ob&s;ervation, that it would be mo&s;t advi&s;eable to &s;teer for Leghorn. "We are," &s;aid he, "thanks to the Almighty, all in good health

<P>This propo&s;al was embraced with avidity by the whole company, who immediately began to clear the boats of all incumbrances, &s;o that they &s;oon had them out and rigged, and then proceeded to embark the mo&s;t valuable of their effects, provi&s;ions, water, &amp;c. The cap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ain, for fear of being &s;eparated by another &s;quall, propo&s;ed making a tow-line fa&s;t to the head of each boat, by which, in ca&s;e of extremity, they on board the cutter would be enabled to get on board the long|boat.</P>
<P>About four in the afternoon they left the wreck, and &s;tee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed away under an ea&s;y &s;ail Ea&s;t by South.

<P>About &s;un-&s;et they de&s;cried a &s;loop a head, at the di&s;tance of about a league, which they &s;oon met. They hailed her, and reque&s;ted the commander to come on board the long boat, which he immediately complied with. This gentleman proved to be the captain's bro|ther before mentioned, who expre&s;&s;ed much a&s;toni&s;h|ment at &s;eeing them coming from &s;ea in an open boat; but his &s;urprize vani&s;hed when informed of the particu|lars, and was much affected with the narrative; but bid them be of good cheer, as they would quickly be among humane and ho&s;pitable people, who would render them all the &s;ervice in their power.</P>
<P>In about three hours they anchored before Leghorn. Being late at night, it was agreed to &s;tay on board the &s;loop till next morning, except the captain, who went on &s;hore.</P>
<P>In the morning they di&s;embarked, and our hero hired one of the &s;ailors to carry his baggage. He had ju&s;t taken leave of his captain, and received his bro|ther's directions where to find &s;uitable accommodations for &s;ome days, when, as he was handing I&s;abella along, he was met by a gentleman in a rich Italian habit, who, after being informed of their &s;hipwreck, kindly welcomed them on &s;hore, and invited them to take

breakfa&s;t with him. They con&s;ented, and he conducted them to a very elegant hou&s;e, where they were kindly received by the mi&s;tre&s;s. Among other enquiries, the gentleman a&s;ked Mercutio the place of his nativity? Finding him an Engli&s;hman, which he was him&s;elf, he told him he intended to remove to England in a very &s;hort time, and politely offered him his hou&s;e, if he would &s;tay with them: He added, that he expected to embark with his whole family in three weeks at farthe&s;t.&mdash;Ju&s;t then a man entered the room, the unex|pected fight of whom gave Mercutio no &s;mall plea&s;ure: 'Twas George Wright!&mdash;The familiarity of the &s;alu|tation of tho&s;e two friends, amazed the whole family. But George &s;oon removed their &s;urprize by informing them of the very great intimacy which had &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between them.</P>
<P>George embraced the fir&s;t opportunity of taking our hero a&s;ide, to enquire what brought him to Italy again. When Mercutio had &s;atisfied him in every particular, he in his turn informed him, that his wife had paid the debt of nature, &s;hortly after his departure for England. She fell a victim, &s;aid he, to the &s;ame di&s;ea&s;e which car|ried off my uncle and aunt. She was no &s;ooner attack|ed by it than the mo&s;t unfavourable &s;ymptoms appear|ed.

&s;u&s;pected the truth.&mdash;The elde&s;t of the three, both in years and practice, beckoned to me to follow him, and when in private, &s;aid: Endeavor, Sir, to collect all your fortitude, to &s;upport you under your affliction&mdash;To di&s;|&s;emble in &s;uch a ca&s;e would be unpardonable&mdash;Your amiable &s;pou&s;e will &s;oon be numbered with the dead!

<P>His prediction was truly verified, for exactly at the time he mentioned, &s;he expired in my arms! I mu&s;t confe&s;s, it was the greate&s;t &s;hock I had ever experienced.

ducats, however, &s;ilenced them on that head; but they in&s;i&s;ted on celebrating ma&s;s on the &s;pot, which I did not think proper to refu&s;e.</P>
<P>The clouds of melancholy enveloped my mind for a con&s;iderable time, and it is doubtful whether I &s;hould have re&s;umed my native cheerfulne&s;s yet, had I remained in Venice. I re&s;i&s;ted the &s;olicitations of my friends a long time&mdash;at length, weary of their impor|tunity, I re&s;olved to pur&s;ue their advice, and, as I had &s;ome affairs to &s;ettle in Naples, I made ready to go thither immediately.</P>
<P>While I remained there, I went to Mount Ve&s;uvius, at lea&s;t, as near as the &s;tones, &s;ulphur, a&s;hes and flames would permit, as there was a mo&s;t violent eruption, which covered the neighboring fields and gardens with tho&s;e combu&s;tibles. From thence, I vi&s;ited the tomb of the celebrated Virgil, which &s;tands at a &s;mall di&s;|tance from a &s;ubterraneous pa&s;&s;age, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ut quite through the ba&s;e of a large mountain, known there by the name of Paufilipo's Grotto.

<P>However, not to trouble you with a recital of every place and thing I &s;aw, in travelling from Naples to

Leghorn, I took my abode in this hou&s;e, the owner of which is now my father-in-law, and as worthy a man as England ever produced. He then confirmed what the gentleman had told our hero, adding, that he was to accompany the family to England, and was highly plea&s;ed, when he found Mercutio was to be of the party.</P>
<P>Mercutio de&s;ired to be introduced to Mrs. Wright; but George informed him that &s;he was not in Leghorn, that he lived in St. Marino; but told him he intended to &s;et out next morning for that place, and reque&s;ted him and his lady to accompany him&mdash;declaring that nothing could give him &s;o much plea&s;ure and &s;atisfaction. Our hero gladly accepted the invitation. They then joined the company, when George was introduced in form to I&s;abella, who received his &s;alute with the ut|mo&s;t complai&s;ance as her hu&s;band's friend.</P>
<P>The next morning early, they &s;et forward, and met a cordial reception from Eliza, Mrs. Wright, who was as complete a female figure, perhaps, as Italy could afford. The mode&s;t and &s;prightly behavior of this lady to her new acquaintances, unfolded a &s;weetne&s;s of temper, not frequently equalled, and never exceeded: In &s;hort, her whole deportment reflected the highe&s;t honor on the choice and judgment of her hu&s;band.</P>
<P>The dwelling of George was &s;ituated at the foot of a mountain, on the &s;ummit of which &s;tands the capital

of St. Marino. A beautiful green of con&s;iderable ex|tent, lay in front of the hou&s;e, terminating in an acute angle at one end, and widening at the other in a gradual manner, till it pa&s;&s;es the end of the mountain, and lo&s;es it&s;elf in a beautiful champaign country, diver&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">fied with fields, gardens, and delightful villas.

<P>George, it &s;eems, had &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nce his &s;econd marriage and removal to St. Marino, taken frequent excur&s;ions through &s;everal parts of the mountain and villages ad|jacent.&mdash;In one of his morning rambles, he perceived a path leading towards a high and craggy promontory, which j<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tted over the &s;ea. He could not &s;pare time to examine where it led to then, returned home, and thought no more about it, until one evening as they were all &s;itting, enjoying the plea&s;ant breeze, and ad|miring the diver&s;ity of the objects which immediately &s;urrounded them. "Mercutio," &s;aid he, "let us take a walk&punc; I &s;tumbled on a path not long before I went to Leghorn, which, if I am not mi&s;taken, leads to &s;ome romantic place, and I have a curio&s;ity to &s;ee it&mdash; what &s;ay you, will you accompany me?"&mdash;"With all my heart," &s;aid he, "come ladies, favor us with your company." This was agreed to, and they all &s;et out immediately.</P>
<P><PB N="144" REF="031902_0142_0FEF3CAC74421510">After walking about a quarter of a mile along its ba&s;e, they began to a&s;cend the mountain by a narrow path, which led to a &s;mall village near the &s;ummit. The path was too narrow to admit more than one at a time; &s;o George led them on, the two ladies kept the centre, and Mercutio clo&s;ed the rear.</P>
<P>When they had a&s;cended to nearly the midway, George &s;truck off into a &s;maller path, which was the one he had mentioned. They had not travelled far on that cour&s;e, till they came into a place which appeared to have been once cultivated: Here they found vines laden with mo&s;t delicious grapes, of which they all eat heartily. George was not mi&s;taken in his opinion of the place, for a more romantic &s;cene was never painted; but his having &s;urveyed the promontory from the water, and ob&s;erving the direction of the path, enabled him to found his judgment truly. They all &s;at down on a flat &s;tone to di&s;cour&s;e on the amazing &s;cene.</P>
<P>They were about midway between the ba&s;e of the mountain, which in that part was wa&s;hed by the &s;ea, and the &s;ummit.

What particularly encrea&s;ed
<PB N="145" REF="031902_0143_0FEF3CAF15A536C8">
their a&s;toni&s;hment, was the number of trees and &s;hrubs which proceeded in all directions from the fi&s;ures of that amazing rock; for the contra&s;t of colours occa&s;ion|ed by the various &s;pecies and po&s;itions of the trees, gave it the appearance of a &s;pacious arched ceiling, curiou&s;ly ornamented with tape&s;try.</P>
<P>The ladies viewed this piece of natural architecture with the utmo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hment. With amazement, they ca&s;t upwards their wondering eyes, at the awful pile which hung over, and threatened to fall and cru&s;h them to atoms. "Let us go down," &s;aid I&s;abella; "my eyes ach looking at this mon&s;trous rock!" "The pro&s;pect is really terrifying," &s;aid Eliza. As it was near &s;un-&s;et they agreed to return, and accordingly be|gan to de&s;cend in the &s;ame order in which they had a&s;|cended. When they were near the foot, Mercutio, hearing a ru&s;tling at &s;ome di&s;tance above him, turn|ed about and perceived a man, &s;tep nimbly into the path which led to the old vineyard. He in&s;tantly com|municated the di&s;covery to the re&s;t of the company, and they all continued to watch the Mountaineer, un|til intervening objects rendered it impo&s;&s;ible. They &s;et forward again, di&s;cour&s;ing as they went of the &s;trange adventure of the man of the mountain. "That man," &s;aid I&s;abella, "is unacquainted with the na|ture of the place to which he is going, or is fonder of retirement than I am." "I am of opinion," &s;aid Mercutio, "that he has &s;ome &s;ort of a habitation a|mong tho&s;e rocks. I will examine that place clo&s;ely to-morrow.

<P>At the dawn of day, George and Mercutio a|ro&s;e, and, leaving their beauteous partners wrapt in calm &s;lumbers beneath the calmy pinions of repo&s;e, &s;et forward towards the mountain, in order, if po&s;|&s;ible, to explore the rocky cavern, which contained the per&s;on they perceived a&s;cending the preceding evening.</P>
<P>They arrived at the old vineyard ju&s;t as the fun beams began to penetrate the horizontal mi&s;ts; and with the utmo&s;t &s;ilence and caution, placed them&s;elves under a &s;preading vine, &s;o advantageou&s;ly, that it was impo&s;&s;ible for their game to e&s;cape; nor was it po&s;&s;i|ble for any per&s;on to a&s;cend or de&s;cend by the path without di&s;covery.

<P>The &s;tranger, after walking backward and forward in &s;ilence, with his arms folded, exclaimed aloud, with all the marks of grief and anxiety in his coun|tenance, "Why, O Why! ye immortal powers, have ye be&s;towed on me every thing that the world conceives conducive to happine&s;s, and &s;uffer me neverthele&s;s, to exi&s;t here a living monument of thy di&s;plea&s;ure, &s;ecluded from the &s;ociety of mankind?&mdash;If without knowledge or intention, I have merited puni&s;hment extreme, O ha&s;ten my di&s;&s;olution, by hurling the hi&s;|&s;ing bolts of thy vengeance on my devoted head; and, at one &s;troke, reduce me to a &s;tate of nonenti|ty!

They a&s;&s;ured him upon honor they would. "Fir&s;t then, were you ever in this place before this morning?" They immediately recounted to him the adventures of the preceding evening, not omitting

the mo&s;t minute circum&s;tance. This information in|&s;pired him with fre&s;h life: He then demanded if they were natives of England?

<P>"Forgive me, gentlemen," &s;aid he, "I behave ve|ry ill; but I doubt not your genero&s;ity will impute it to the real cau&s;e."

<P>Eugenio, the &s;tranger, perceiving their impatience to hear his &s;tory, began thus:&mdash;"Well, gentlemen, I &s;uppo&s;e you have not met with &s;uch a &s;cene as this in all your travels: If you plea&s;e, we will de&s;cend into my &s;ubterraneous habitation, which exhibits a lively epitome of my own wretchedne&s;s." The de&s;cent was very craggy, which &s;upplied the want of &s;tairs. After de&s;cending about twelve feet perpendicular, they found them&s;elves in a kind of grotto, the floor of which was compo&s;ed of &s;olid marble. The roof was of a concave form, lined with party-coloured &s;hells, and &s;tones of different complexions and qualities. The cave was about thirty feet long, and fifteen in width: The end

next to the &s;ea was entirely open, forming an arch; and that part which compo&s;ed the roof, projected full fifteen feet beyond the mouth of the cavern, which &s;creened him effectually from rain. The pro&s;pect it afforded was really terrifying: Nothing could be ob|&s;erved at the back part of the cave; but the terror was greatly encrea&s;ed by ca&s;ting the eye downward from the mouth to the dreadful cliffs which hung below. One would be tempted, when viewing this &s;cene, to &s;up|po&s;e that the author of the tragedy of Lear, was &s;it|ting in the mouth of this cave, when penning the de&s;cription which he puts into the mouth of Edgar, in order to deter old Glo&s;ter from the de&s;perate act of ca&s;ting him&s;elf headlong from &s;uch a height.</P>
<P>In one corner of the cave lay a matra&s;s and &s;ome other bedding; in another, a &s;mall trunk, which &s;erved the double purpo&s;e of table and cupboard: A &s;mall kegg, and a brace of pi&s;tols made up the re&s;t of the furniture, all which had been procured and con|veyed thither by the tru&s;ty &s;ervant.</P>
<P>Being all &s;eated on the matra&s;s, Eugenio proceeded to relate his &s;tory:&mdash;"My narrative," &s;aid he, "gentle|men, will be found barren of plea&s;ure or amu&s;ement, as it con&s;i&s;ts entirely (the latter part at lea&s;t) of melancholy, vexation and de&s;pair.

France, Spain, and Italy. In con&s;equence of this re|&s;olution, he &s;ought out an elderly gentleman, of good morals, completely ver&s;ed in the &s;ciences, a competent judge of the human mind and the pa&s;&s;ions of it. He po&s;&s;e&s;t a &s;weetne&s;s of temper peculiar to him&s;elf, and his countenance and deportment would have commanded re&s;pect among ruffians. Such a per&s;on, inheriting every endearing qualification, could not have failed to attract my mo&s;t profound reverence and e&s;teem: I already anticipated the profit, as well as plea&s;ure, I &s;hould derive from the company of a gentleman, who knew how to blend the mo&s;t in&s;truc|tive precepts with the mo&s;t familiar conver&s;ation, from which I might imbibe principles that would re|flect honor on the choice of my father, the abilities of my tutor, and on my own genius and indu&s;try.</P>

Naples, &s;taid there a &s;hort time and &s;et out for Florence, which we never yet have reached. Having mi&s;&s;ed our proper road we travelled till we were within an incon|&s;iderable di&s;tance of the capital of St. Marino. My tu|tor, who had formerly been there, propo&s;ed, as we were &s;o near, to ride into town, put up our hor&s;es, refre&s;h, and &s;pend an hour or two in the evening in the governor's garden, which, he &s;aid, was a per|fect type of Eden&mdash;lodge in St. Marino that night, and &s;tart for Florence in the morning. I made no objection but &s;ubmitted every thing to his &s;uperior judg|ment. The landlord where we halted, &s;ent a little Italian with us to the porter of the governor's gardens, to re|que&s;t admi&s;&s;ion for us in his ma&s;ter's name. He inform|ed the porter that we were a couple of foreign gentle|men on our travels, who had rode a con&s;iderable di&s;|tance out of our way in order to take a view of the gardens, and that his ma&s;ter would e&s;teem the favor as done to him&s;elf if he would admit us. He admitted us without he&s;itation, for which my tutor rewarded him with a piece of gold. He then conducted us to a walk which led to the centre. I was &s;truck with admira|tion at the a&s;toni&s;hing &s;truggle between nature and art, which appeared in the beauteous di&s;po&s;ition of the innu|merable &s;urrounding objects. In the centre, a ba&s;on of marble, well &s;tocked with gold and &s;ilver fi&s;h, fifteen yards diameter, had a very fine e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ct, which was encrea&s;ed by the figure of a &s;ea-hor&s;e, gilt, in the mid|dle of the ba&s;on, from the no&s;trils of which two &s;treams of water projected to the height of thirty feet. The

ba&s;on is immediately &s;urrounded by ten beautiful olive trees, planted at equal di&s;tances. Twenty yards from the&s;e, another circle of trees afford a charming &s;helter to the delightful arbors which occupy the intermediate &s;paces. Here per&s;ons of the fir&s;t rank in the republic, u&s;ually &s;pend their evenings, after fea&s;ting their &s;ight and &s;mell with the exqui&s;ite odours which proceed from the flowers of every hue; which, by the culti|vating hands of the mo&s;t celerated flori&s;ts, are taught to grow in every direction. In each of the&s;e arbors is an elegant organ, which, by turning a &s;mall bra&s;s cock, plays off thirty-&s;ix favorite Italian airs: They can all be &s;et going together, or one, two, &amp;c. at plea|&s;ure. The contrivance is a ma&s;ter piece of art: By rai&s;ing a &s;mall gate in the &s;ide of a canal at &s;ome di&s;|tance, from which the ba&s;on is &s;upplied, a &s;mall trunk is immediately filled with water; at the other extremity of which are as many bra&s;s cocks as there are organs: When the&s;e are turned, the mu&s;ic begins. One of tho&s;e organs was playing ju&s;t as we pa&s;&s;ed the door of the arbor. We &s;topped a while to li&s;ten to the enchanting &s;ound, an Eunuch coming out at that moment, my tutor enquired if a couple of foreigners might be admitted. He de&s;ired us to wait a moment, left us, and in&s;tantly returning, de&s;ired us to walk in. We complied, and were much &s;urprized at being &s;aluted, on our entrance, by five ladies"&mdash;(Here he faultered)&mdash;"Five ladies richly habited and clo&s;ely veiled."

<P>"We returned their &s;alute in a proper manner. The mu&s;ic was &s;uddenly &s;topt, and one of the ladies, who by her air and the &s;uperiority of her dre&s;s, appear|ed to claim the precedence, reque&s;ted us to be &s;eated, with which we complied. She then a&s;ked how long we had been in Italy? My tutor &s;atisfied her in this particular, &s;he proceeded to a&s;k &s;everal other que&s;tions concerning our pa&s;t travels, and the route we intended to take; to all of which we an&s;wered without re&s;erve. She expre&s;&s;ed her &s;atisfaction with the di&s;cription we had given her of England, France, and the other places through which we had pa&s;&s;ed; and in her turn de&s;crib|ed in the mo&s;t animating &s;tyle, the innumerable rarities of Italy, adding, that three days would not be &s;ufficient to review tho&s;e gardens, as they were very exten&s;ive. We pa&s;&s;ed the highe&s;t encomiums on the ta&s;te, magnifi|cence and convenience, which appeared in every part; but urged the unavoidable nece&s;&s;ity of departing from thence the next morning, as our time was limited, and we had &s;pent a great portion of it in France; therefore, it required our exertion, in order to fini&s;h our intended tour within the appointed time.</P>
<P>"To this &s;he made no an&s;wer, but rung a &s;mall bell, which brought the Eunuch, to whom &s;he whi&s;pered a few words: He withdrew immediately, but &s;oon after returned, bearing two bottles, &s;ome gla&s;&s;es, and
<PB N="155" REF="031902_0153_0FEF31CC76513278">
a ca&s;ket of the mo&s;t dilicious fruits. Having placed the&s;e on a table, he was ordered to &s;et the mu&s;ic to playing. The ladies invited us to partake of this re|fre&s;hment. The mu&s;ic began, and the ladies unveiled.&mdash; But ah! The pangs that &s;ight has co&s;t me are beyond de&s;cription! The fir&s;t time my ravi&s;hed eyes met tho&s;e of the beauteous Terentia, my &s;oul experienced emo|tions to which, till then, I had been a &s;tranger! Un|der the&s;e new impre&s;&s;ions I was much embarra&s;&s;ed, I retired for &s;ome time, for feeling my face flu&s;hed with an unu&s;ual warmth, I was afraid my tutor &s;hould perceive my agitation; well knowing him to be a man of the mo&s;t acute penetration, and apt to draw the mo&s;t exact conclu&s;ions. I was convinced that the beauteous object who was the cau&s;e of my emotion, perceived it plainly; for whenever my eyes accidentally met her's, I found them rivetted on me; &s;he would then ca&s;t them downwards, and affect to be paying earne&s;t attention to the mu&s;ic. Having walked once or twice round the ba&s;on, I found my&s;elf pretty well compo|&s;ed; I &s;ummoned all my fortitude, and returned to my company. After the organ had played off a round, my tutor made a motion to retire; accordingly, hav|ing made a proper acknowledgement, for the very kind reception we had met with, we took leave and de|parted.</P>
<P>"We returned to our inn, and retired early to re&s;t. When I reflected on our evening's adventure, I began to be well &s;atisfied at leaving St. Marino in the morning,

as the means of obliterating the memory of an infant attachment, which, if &s;uffered to gather &s;trength, mu&s;t inevitably draw after it a train of di&s;agreeable, if not fatal con&s;equences; for by the influence the dear Te|rentia had over the re&s;t of the ladies, I concluded, and rightly too, that &s;he mu&s;t be the governor's daughter. My &s;leep, however, was much di&s;turbed by dreams, yet when my tutor awakened me, which was at day|break, I found my&s;elf in tolerable &s;pirits. The rea&s;on he a&s;&s;igned for waking me &s;o early, was, that it would be much more agreeable to ride in the morning, than in the &s;corching rays of noon. I ro&s;e immediately, and though the mandate appeared &s;omewhat di&s;agreea|ble at fir&s;t, yet I dre&s;&s;ed bri&s;kly: In the mean time, my tutor rou&s;ed the landlord, and ordered our hor&s;es to be got ready immediately.

We had depo&s;ited a hun|dred guineas, the value of the hor&s;es, in the hands of the owner, but were to be reimbur&s;ed in Florence, by the per&s;on to whom we were to deliver them, all but fifteen guineas, which was for their hire.</P>

We &s;tood &s;ome minutes to view this magnificent &s;tructure, and as we were turning to go to the gardens, I perceived at one of the upper windows, the lady who had treated us &s;o kindly the preceding evening; but perceiving us, &s;he in&s;tantly di&s;appeared.</P>

So, after taking a parting em|brace, I fear for ever, of my dear Terentia, he gave me a burning, waxen taper in my hand; then lifting a trap door, be&s;towed on me his benediction, and I entered the di&s;mal gulph, overwhelmed with all the horrors which &s;uch a dreadful vici&s;&s;itude was capa|ble of producing. He &s;hut down the door and left me to penetrate the bowels of this mountain for near a mile, under the mo&s;t excruciating torture of mind. At length, I emerged once more into open air, through a crevice of a rock barely wide enough to ad|mit me. I wandered about through the thickets, &s;ome|times mi&s;&s;ing my &s;teps and falling many yards down the rugged &s;ide of the mountain, till day light, when I found my&s;elf on the uppermo&s;t declivity of this pro|montory, which affords a much more horrid pro&s;pect than you now behold. In that inho&s;pitable &s;pot I &s;at down, weary and faint with climbing from one ridge of rocks to another, all night, to bemoan my adver&s;e fate, ruminating on the dreadful &s;ituation to which, in the &s;hort &s;pace of two days and two nights, I was reduced, the circum&s;tances which produced, and tho&s;e which accompanied this change; I became as it were, petrified with grief and a&s;toni&s;hment, and re|mained in&s;en&s;ible of every thing, and &s;hould probably,
<PB N="162" REF="031902_0160_0FEF3CE1745C3C60">
never have recovered, had not my man, who provi|dentially through curio&s;ity watched us to the cell, and lay perdue till the guards were gone, di&s;covered my retreat. He, ob&s;erving that they took my dear &s;pou&s;e and the Friar with them, &s;u&s;pected I was &s;lain, and as &s;oon as they were out of &s;ight, entered the cell.</P>
<P>"After he had called me &s;everal times by name, he began to &s;earch diligently, and finding a waxen taper, light it, and as he has &s;ince informed me, &s;earched eve|ry part of the cell with great minutene&s;s. He was ex|ceedingly &s;urprized, and could not believe his own eyes: Looking again, however, very narrowly, he e&s;pied the trap door, which he rai&s;ed and de&s;cended in&s;tantly&punc; He continued pur&s;uing and calling me until his taper was exhau&s;ted, and then groped his way to the hole through which I had pa&s;&s;ed. It being then broad day, &s;o that in &s;ome places he could trace my foot&s;teps along. Ob&s;erving &s;omething white, at a di&s;tance on an emi|nence, far above him, he advanced towards it, thinking I had laid down, and hung my handkerchief there as a &s;ignal to him in ca&s;e he &s;hould &s;earch for me. However, in this he was mi&s;taken; for though it was my handker|chief. I was not there, but had dropped it by accident. But it happened through the providence of God, that as he &s;tood debating with him&s;elf whether he &s;hould proceed, or return back by the way he came, and in|form my tutor of what had happened, that he perceived me at the di&s;tance, he &s;uppo&s;ed, of three quarters of a mile, climbing over a ridge of rocks. He had once
<PB N="163" REF="031902_0161_0FEF3CE4B0375A70">
a mind to call; but reflecting, that as I was igno|rant of his having followed me, I might conceive it to be &s;ome of the guards in pur&s;uit, and conceal my&s;elf where he would not be able to find me, deter|mined to follow in &s;ilence.</P>
<P>"He found me in the &s;ituation I have before de|&s;cribed, and having after a long &s;earch, found a &s;pring i&s;&s;uing from a rock, he wa&s;hed my face and temples, by which means I recovered my &s;en&s;es again. Mi&s;erable as I was, a tran&s;ient gleam of joy ran through my &s;oul on beholding my tru&s;ty, affectionate &s;ervant; but gloomy reflections took place of that, and I fear will pervade my &s;oul till death puts a period to my life and mi&s;eries together.</P>
<P>"The place in which he found me, afforded no &s;helter from the fury of a &s;torm, which was collecting, we therefore &s;et out in &s;earch for a &s;ituation that would, and chance directed us to this cavern. About noon the clouds di&s;per&s;ed, and the weather became &s;erene, my man de|clared he would endeavor to find the way to town, in order to gain &s;ome intelligence of my tutor, if po&s;&s;ible, and to procure &s;ome provi&s;ions for me. Though I ar|dently wi&s;hed to know how matters had been conducted &s;ince the unhappy affair of the preceding evening, and though we could not exi&s;t long without &s;ome refre&s;h|ment, yet it was with reluctance I permitted him to go. A thou&s;and doubts and fears po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed my mind, until he returned, and informed me of his &s;ucce&s;s. On
<PB N="164" REF="031902_0162_0FEF3CE665653630">
his arrival in town, it was his intention to go to our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> but fear being ever watchful, before he ventured to ap|proach, he took care to have a watchful eye about him, le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t he &s;hould be di&s;covered, and was no &s;ooner within &s;ight of the hou&s;e than he perceived it &s;urrounded by guards. He retreated with &s;ome precipitation, down a narrow lane, which led to a remote part of the town. Slackening his pace a little, he accidentally met an old acquaintance, with whom he had contracted an intima|cy when attending my father in his travels. His friend invited him to partake of a bottle of wine, to which he complied, and while drinking, they enquired of each other the particulars of their travels, employment, &amp;c. They both an&s;wered without re&s;erve. "My friend," &s;aid the other to my man, "I am &s;orry to find you are in the &s;ervice of a per&s;on, who if found, will meet the mo&s;t rigorous treatment, if not an ignominious death. The old gentleman, his companion, is now in a dungeon, as well as the Friar and landlord; and I am afraid that will not be the greate&s;t puni&s;hment the Governor will inflict on them, for he is much enraged again&s;t them. I was pre&s;ent at their whole examina|tion, and though there does not appear any cau&s;e of accu&s;ation again&s;t any but the Friar, they will &s;hare the &s;ame puni&s;hment."</P>
<P>"My man then reque&s;ted him to tell every circum|&s;tance he knew, which he did in a few words. He informed him, that an ancient Duenna, who had nur&s;ed Terentia, and had a real affection for her, &s;eeing her &s;et
<PB N="165" REF="031902_0163_0FEF3CE99BC223E0">
out towards the Friar's cell, re&s;olved to follow and ac|company her home, but on &s;eeing her &s;o familiarly give me her hand and enter the wood with me, returned in|&s;tantly, and informed the Governor of the di&s;covery &s;he had made, who immediately ordered his guards to go to Friar John's cell, and bring every per&s;on he found there in&s;tantly before him. The dear creature di&s;claim|ed all manner of knowledge or acquaintance with me: That &s;he had met a gentleman on her entering the wood, &s;he confe&s;&s;ed, but denied having any di&s;cour&s;e with him. The Friar al&s;o per&s;i&s;ted in having &s;een her come alone to the cell, and that there had been no other per&s;on there that evening.</P>
<P>"Notwith&s;tanding all their a&s;&s;everations of innocence, the Friar was committed to the dungeon, and my dear bride to the care of the Duenna, with orders to keep her clo&s;ely confined from the &s;ight of every per&s;on but her&s;elf. "Your hor&s;es," continued his friend, "were found in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a man, who would not deliver them to any per&s;on but &s;ome of the Governor's hou&s;|hold: The landlord, and the old gentleman took him by force and conveyed him to town late la&s;t night, confined him in a room till this morning, when they obtained an audience of the Governor, and had their pri&s;oner examined. His examination developed the whole affair, for he produced a note in the hand writing of Terentia, charging him to keep the hor&s;es &s;afely, until the bearer or &s;ome other of her father's dome&s;tics &s;hould demand them, and not then with|out
<PB N="166" REF="031902_0164_0FEF3CEE36BF1F18">
her orders in writing. On being a&s;ked who de|livered the hor&s;es to him, he an&s;wered he believed it to be one of the Governor's Eunuch's, and that he was &s;ure he &s;hould know him if he could &s;ee him again. All the Eunuchs were then brought into the pre&s;ence of the governor, and the man in&s;tantly pointed out the culprit. He denied the fact po&s;itively, and bore the rack a con&s;iderable time before he di&s;clo&s;ed the truth. He confe&s;&s;ed that his mi&s;tre&s;s had given him orders to watch two gentlemen from the gardens to their lodgings, to find out whether they travelled on hor&s;eback or not: That having performed this, he informed her of every circum&s;tance, and that &s;he gave him money and the note, charging him to go in the night, take the hor&s;es out of the &s;table, and convey them to the place where they were found. The Governor ordered him to be &s;trangled immediately. The man in who&s;e cu&s;tody the hor&s;es were found, was &s;everely &s;courged, for not giving immediate notice to the Governor of the&s;e proceedings:" A guard was &s;ent to the inn to &s;earch for me, with orders not to return without me; and my tutor and the landlord clo&s;ely confined, till I &s;hould be found.</P>
<P>"This was all he could collect at that time, and being well a&s;&s;ured of the fidelity of his friend, informed him of my concealment, and begged he would a&s;&s;i&s;t him in procuring &s;ome nece&s;&s;aries for my &s;upport: This he complied with&punc; and they parted, having previou&s;ly agreed to meet the next day at the &s;ame place.</P>
<P><PB N="167" REF="031902_0165_0FEF3CF154F7EB80">"My man returned in the evening, much fatigued, having carried this matra&s;s and cover, be&s;ides provi|&s;ions enough for a week's &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, and a large fla&s;k of wine.</P>
<P>"When I reflected on the concatenation of circum|&s;tances by which my late happine&s;s, and pre&s;ent mi&s;e|ry was effected, I could not but admire the power of love, which &s;urmounts every difficulty, and maugre con&s;equences, braves every danger to attain its end. It is obvious, that our hor&s;es were taken for no other purpo&s;e than to detain us in St. Marino &s;ome day<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> longer. But to proceed:&mdash;</P>
<P>"From the information of my man, re&s;pecting the fidelity of his friend, I began to entertain hopes of yet regaining my dear Terentia, if there was a po&s;&s;ibi|lity of conveying a letter to her. I communicated the&s;e ideas to my man, which he &s;aid exactly corre&s;ponded with his, and added, that but for the &s;hortne&s;s of the time, he would have &s;ounded his friend on that &s;ubject, but would not fail to try every expedient to procure me the &s;atisfaction I de&s;ired. He met his friend accord|ing to appointment and found every thing to his wi&s;h. His friend is in the &s;ervice of an Engli&s;h gentleman, who lodges in a hou&s;e in a back &s;treet, the back win|dows of which overlooks the Governor's private garden, which is immediately attached to the palace.&mdash; His friend further informed him, that he had formed an intimacy with a female dome&s;tic of the Governor's,
<PB N="168" REF="031902_0166_0FEF3CF41FCA36D0">
by who&s;e means he could be informed of every par|ticular relative to my af<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">airs. He &s;aid, the Duenna attended the young lady as the &s;hadow the &s;ub&s;tance; but that he did not doubt finding means to convey her a letter, if committed to his charge. My man a&s;&s;ur|ed him of an ample reward if he &s;ucceeded; but with all conjured him not to communicate the &s;ecret to his fair enamoratta. He then, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his friend, procured pen, ink and paper; flint, &s;teel and candles, and returned to me full of the &s;ucce&s;s of his ne|gociation. I was overjoyed at the pro&s;pect of return|ing happine&s;s, and embraced him as a brother&mdash;indeed he has manife&s;ted the mo&s;t un&s;haken attachment, and unwearied diligence in &s;oothing my misfortunes, which demands my utmo&s;t regard,</P>
<P>"The next morning I wrote a letter to my dear girl, wherein I de&s;cribed my dreadful &s;ituation&mdash;painted the angui&s;h of my mind on her particular account, and my &s;orrow for the fate of my beloved tutor. I conjured her by the &s;acred ties which united our &s;ouls, to let me know the &s;ituation of affairs there, and gave her a hint of the fidelity of the per&s;on who forwarded the letter. I &s;ealed and delivered this to my faithful &s;ervant. "Now, &s;ir," &s;aid he, "don't be alarmed, if you &s;hould not &s;ee me for a day or two&punc; as it is impo&s;&s;ible to hurry this kind of bu&s;ine&s;s, becau&s;e it depends entirely upon circum&s;tances, and mu&s;t be conducted with the greate&s;t caution." He was gone four days and as many tedious nights: I began to look on my ruin as
<PB N="169" REF="031902_0167_0FEF3CF9D74820F8">
inevitable. I &s;aw already my man &s;tretched on the rack &mdash;&s;aw the guards a&s;cending the mountain, and was &s;everal times preparing to take the de&s;perate leap, from which you prevented me to day. It was my determination to e&s;cape my enemies by that means, if ever they &s;hould di&s;cover my retreat.</P>
<P>"At length, however, he arrived with a letter from her dear hand: (Here he read the letter:) He &s;aid his friend bid him tell me, that he had never run &s;uch a hazzard in his life, as he did in procuring it. He had taken an opportunity of dropping my letter into the walk before her, when her keeper was at &s;ome di&s;tance behind. Terentia, &s;aw it fall, and ca&s;ting her eyes upwards and perceiving him, &s;eemed to he&s;itate; how|ever, &s;he picked it up and thru&s;t it ha&s;tily into her bo|&s;om. Her keeper overtook her pre&s;ently and pa&s;&s;ed her, and after &s;ome time went into the palace. Dur|ing her &s;tay in the hou&s;e he ob&s;erved my wife, &s;eated in a &s;hady &s;pot, reading the letter, with much appa|rent emotion. She &s;uppre&s;&s;ed her agitation, and &s;eem|ed anxious to &s;peak to him; but that was impo&s;&s;ible, as the Duenna ju&s;t then returned. The next morning, very early, he po&s;ted him&s;elf at the window, and though it was but ju&s;t day light, &s;he was there. She perceived him immediately, and &s;howed him a billet which &s;he &s;eemed anxious to convey to him. He made a &s;ign to her to throw it down, and retire, giving her to under&s;tand that he would de&s;cend for it, &s;he under|&s;tood him and immediately complied. He then, by the help of a rope-ladder, which was kept in the hou&s;e
<PB N="170" REF="031902_0168_0FEF3CFD1621E4C0">
in ca&s;e of fire, de&s;cended &s;peedily, took up the letter, and returned to his po&s;t; then taking up his ladder he &s;tood &s;ome minutes, till the dear creature, who had been ob&s;erving his motions, returned to the &s;pot where &s;he had left the letter, and perceiving it gone, looked up at him with a glow of &s;atisfaction on her counte|nance, and retired into the hou&s;e. His friend further &s;aid that he did not conceive it impo&s;&s;ible to deliver her entirely from her confinement, and if I could devi&s;e means to convey her out of Italy immediately, he would freely undertake it.</P>
<P>"You &s;ee gentlemen," &s;aid he, "that my worthy tu|tor is condemned to linger out his days in a mi&s;erable dungeon, and &s;elf pre&s;ervation will not permit me to take any &s;tep towards effecting his liberation. This thought afflicts me beyond mea&s;ure. If he had incur|red his puni&s;hment by any mi&s;conduct of his own, I &s;hould have been &s;en&s;ibly afflicted; but the reflection of his being entirely innocent, and of the whole crime being mine, di&s;tracts me, and, I fear, will make &s;uch an impre&s;&s;ion of grief on my mind, as will never be ef|faced.</P>
<P>"My &s;ervant is now gone with a letter to inform my dear Terentia that I am determined to free my&s;elf and her quickly, or peri&s;h in the attempt. He is al&s;o to reque&s;t his friend to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in procuring bea&s;ts to convey us to Leghorn, where, if we &s;ucceed, I will embark for England immediately. This, gentlemen,
<PB N="171" REF="031902_0169_0FEF3CFF40108678">
is the &s;um of my unhappy &s;tory, and I think you mu&s;t acknowledge my misfortunes to be peculiarly di&s;tre&s;|&s;ing: &s;uch as, I hope, you will never experience."</P>
<P>They confe&s;&s;ed he had been unfortunate, but ex|horted him to be cheerful, for that his ca&s;e, at pre&s;ent, was by no means de&s;perate; that he had now rea&s;on to expect that his affairs would take a favourable turn. They informed him of their intended voyage, and pro|mi&s;ed him every po&s;&s;ible a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Ju&s;t at this in&s;tant the &s;ervant arrived.</P>
<P>The &s;ervant &s;tarted at the &s;ight of &s;trangers, and was going to retire, but his ma&s;ter, perceiving his intention prevented him, &s;aying, Fear nothing, here are none but friends: Come forward, how have you &s;ped? At that in&s;tant Mercutio and George aro&s;e, with an intention to retire; but Eugenio in&s;i&s;ted on their &s;tay until his &s;ervant &s;hould have di&s;clo&s;ed the re&s;ult of his negociation. They acquie&s;ced, and he de&s;ired the &s;ervant to inform them, without re&s;erve, of all his tran&s;actions &s;ince his departure from thence: He be|gan as follows:&mdash;</P>
<P>"I met my friend at the appointed place, who in|formed me that the Governor of St. Marino intends paying a vi&s;it to the Doge of Venice, in a very &s;hort time: He added, that the lady is not &s;o clo&s;ely confin|ed as &s;he has been, being now permitted to walk in the garden alone. He advi&s;es you, &s;ir, to remain here
<PB N="172" REF="031902_0170_0FEF3D0123636AF0">
until her father &s;ets out for Venice; in the mean time, he promi&s;es to arrange matters &s;o as to effect the libera|tion of the lady immediately after the departure of her father."</P>
<P>He then delivered a letter which, he &s;aid, his friend had procured from the lady's own hand. Eugenio &s;eized it, and read it with avidity, then pre&s;enting it to Mercutio, &s;aid, Behold a &s;light &s;pecimen of her mental accompli&s;hments, and tell me whether the communica|tion of happine&s;s appears to be intimately connected with &s;uch perfection, or not.</P>
<P>After peru&s;ing it attentively, our hero and his friend could not withhold their a&s;&s;ent to his propo&s;ition: They be&s;towed the greate&s;t encomiums on the amiable and beloved writer, who, by the &s;pirit, ea&s;e and ele|gance with which &s;he wrote, would have arre&s;ted the attention, and extorted the approbation of the mo&s;t &s;urly critic. To the mo&s;t ardent vows of eternal fide|lity, united with wi&s;hes for her deliverance, &s;he added an intimation of her father's intended journey to Ve|nice, and a minute account of the particular rout he de&s;igned to take.</P>
<P>Mercutio enjoined Eugenio to make him&s;elf per|fectly ea&s;y, as from the pre&s;ent face of his affairs, he had every rea&s;on to hope they would &s;hortly terminate to his entire &s;atisfaction. George heartily joi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed in the admonition, and added, that his hou&s;e and pur&s;e
<PB N="173" REF="031902_0171_0FEF3D069A678968">
were at his &s;ervice, together with all the per&s;onal a&s;|&s;i&s;tance in his power. "My beloved friends," &s;aid the a&s;toni&s;hed Eugenio, "how &s;hall I render you a proper return for your unparalelled genero&s;ity? The liberality, and exten&s;ive latitude of your offers, when I reflect on my pre&s;ent critical &s;ituation, and the danger to which you expo&s;e your&s;elves in ca&s;e of di&s;covery, really amaze me! Of one thing I am &s;ure&mdash;if the whole of my future <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;hould be devoted entirely to your &s;ervice it would fall infinitely &s;hort of a &s;uitable re|turn." Common humanity, replied George, is &s;uffici|ent in this ca&s;e to prompt us to contribute to your re|lief, therefore we can have no claim on your gratitude; for all the good offices we can po&s;&s;ibly perform in be|half of each other will entitle us to no other reward, than a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of having performed a part of that duty, which, as men, we owe one to another. If by any thing in our power, your happine&s;s is &s;ecured, we &s;hall participate with you in the conviction of hav|ing acted with propriety; and the only acceptable re|turn you can make, is your friend&s;hip, independent of acknowledgments.</P>
<P>This effectually &s;ilenced Eugenio, and George pro|po&s;ed to retire: "In the evening," &s;aid he, "I will &s;end a per&s;on to conduct you and your &s;ervant to my hou&s;e, which is but a &s;hort di&s;tance from hence, where you &s;hall be properly accommodated, and may remain in as much privacy as here, till your affairs are brought to an i&s;&s;ue." Eugenio was about to return an an&s;wer
<PB N="174" REF="031902_0172_0FEF3D08659D16E0">
full of grateful acknowledgments; but they politely taking leave, and bidding him fear nothing, departed.</P>
<P>As they de&s;cended the mountain, their di&s;cour&s;e na|turally turned on the amazing revolutions of human af|fairs. "Eugenio," &s;aid George, "was beginning to grow de&s;perate ye&s;terday, and if we had not di&s;covered his retreat, it is more than probable he would have at|tempted the regaining his wi&s;e by means which, per|haps, might have terminated in his de&s;truction." "Ve|ry likely," replied Mercutio; "the &s;en&s;e of his misfor|tunes had nearly overcome his rea&s;on and fortitude: How often are we prevented, by the interpo&s;ition of Divine Providence from the commi&s;&s;ion of that, which, if permitted, would involve us in inevitable ruin! Then how thankful ought we to be to that mighty Be|ing which &s;pake all things into exi&s;tence, for his mer|ciful conde&s;cen&s;ion in re&s;training us from actions which, if committed, his ju&s;tice mu&s;t have &s;everely puni&s;hed."</P>
<P>Having regained the foot of the mountain, they were joined by their ladies, who were taking a walk along the &s;ea &s;hore, the ground between which and the mountain being covered with a delightful verdure, with fine tufts of trees inter&s;per&s;ed, on the boughs of which millions of birds &s;at &s;inging; the azure concave was beautifully clear to the extremity of the horizon, and every obj<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ct con&s;pired to render their excur&s;ion agreea|ble. It was in this delightful &s;pot that George <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> of the di&s;covery his friend and he had that

morning made. They li&s;tened with a&s;toni&s;hment and expre&s;&s;ed the utmo&s;t &s;olicitude for the &s;ucce&s;s of Euge|nio and Terentia. They next con&s;ulted on the mo&s;t &s;alutary mea&s;ures to be employed with regard to their intended journey, and after rejecting &s;everal propo&s;i|tions, agreed, that preparations &s;hould be made for a &s;udden departure, hor&s;es provided, ready to &s;tart at a minute's warning, and all things packed up ready to lay on them. It was al&s;o thought requi&s;ite that Eugenio and Terentia &s;hould a&s;&s;ume the appearance of &s;ervants, at lea&s;t till their arrival at Florence, in order, by concealing their quality, to prevent di&s;covery. The&s;e preliminaries being agreed to, George in&s;tructed a &s;ervant how to a&s;cend the mountain and to conduct Eugenio down thither in the twilight.</P>
<P>Eugenio arrived attended by his guide and &s;ervant ju&s;t as candles were lighting. The reception he met with, reflected the highe&s;t honour on the feelings of his new found friends: He was introduced to the ladies by Mercutio; they received him with marks of the mo&s;t profound re&s;pect.</P>
<P>Eugenio was a hand&s;ome per&s;on, perfectly well &s;haped and extremely polite; his complexion fair, his features manly; and though his late misfortunes had, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, checked his natural vivacity, yet re|turning hope rendered his company very agreeable, which, added to his mental qualifications, &s;ecured him a &s;trong prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion in the affections of his new friends,

<P>After &s;upper, George informed Eugenio of the plan which had been adopted, which he highly approv|ed, expre&s;&s;ed much &s;urprize at the promptitude of his friends to &s;erve him, and promi&s;ed eternal friend&s;hip in return.</P>
<P>Early on the following day, Eugenio di&s;patched his man with a letter to Terentia, informing her of his for|tunate &s;ituation, and of the plan projected by his friends: He likewi&s;e &s;ent a hand&s;ome pre&s;ent to his agent in town, reque&s;ting at the &s;ame time, his every a&s;&s;i&s;tance to relea&s;e the lady as &s;oon as the Governor &s;hould de|part, a&s;&s;uring him of an ample reward. The man had orders to conceal him&s;elf in town till an an&s;wer was procured. George in&s;tantly began to make the nece&s;|&s;ary arrangements for the intended journey, in which Mercutio a&s;&s;i&s;ted him. The hou&s;e in which George re&s;ided was ready furni&s;hed, therefore his moveables could be ea&s;ily packed in portmantaus, which was immediately done, while our hero and George went in que&s;t of hor&s;es, to tran&s;port them whenever they might be called for. In the mean time, Eugenio's &s;ervant ar|rived with a letter from Terentia, in &s;ub&s;tance as fol|lows:

<P>Eugenio was tran&s;ported beyond mea&s;ure on the pe|ru&s;al of this epi&s;tle, and already anticipated the plea&s;ure of folding his beloved Terentia in his arms. He &s;ub|mitted the letter to the peru&s;al of the ladies, who heartily congratulated him on the apparent pro&s;perous turn of his affairs; and George and Mercutio return|ing &s;hortly after, informed them, they had hor&s;es and every other nece&s;&s;ary accommodation at command on the &s;horte&s;t notice: "And now," &s;aid Mercutio, "ba|ni&s;h anxiety, &s;ince the good old gentleman, your <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> has made his e&s;cape; three days, I hope <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"></P>

The&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> in&s;pired Eugenio with new life, and the vi&s;ible change on his countenance indicated a heart elate with joy. Agreeably to his appointment with his friend, Eugenio's &s;ervan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> to town the next day, and had the &s;atisfaction of &s;eeing the Governor &s;et out; and of hearing that the &s;couts who had been &s;ent in pur&s;uit of the keeper of the pri&s;on, and his fellow travellers, had returned without having been able to procure the lea&s;t intelligence of their rout. It was then concerted be|tween him and his friend, that on the evening of the en|&s;uing day, he &s;hould conduct his ma&s;ter to the &s;pot where he had met Terentia in order to proceed to Fri|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r John's cell, and there wait the arrival of the lady. His friend informed him that Terentia was to feign a &s;light indi&s;po&s;ition &s;ome hours before that appointed for the intended enterprize, and retire to her clo&s;et on pretence of trying to compo&s;e her&s;elf to &s;leep. That <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">her window overlooked the garden, and was not more than four feet from the ground, &s;o that &s;he might de|&s;cend with &s;afety: In the mean time, he would fix the abovementioned ladder of ropes to his own window, with which &s;he was well acquainted, where he would &s;tand centinel and in&s;tantly on her approach, drop the ladder, receive her into the window and, throw a man's long riding cloak over her, conduct her to the appointed &s;pot: He added, that his ma&s;ter's being out <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> for a few days would greatly facilitate the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"></P>
<P><PB N="179" REF="031902_0177_0FEF3D16FAB49468">Having placed every thing in a proper train in town, Eugenio's &s;ervant returned with a billet from the lady, wherein &s;he a&s;&s;ured him of her perfect willingne&s;s, and even impatience to accompany him to any part of the globe.</P>
<P>Eugenio communicated the&s;e welcome tidings to his friends, who partook of his &s;atisfaction on the occa&s;ion. They then concluded, that it would be prudent to &s;end for the hor&s;es in the afternoon; to have the baggage laid on as &s;oon as it was dark, then &s;et forward and travel all night, and, as George knew the whole road perfectly, to halt as &s;eldom as po&s;&s;ible until they &s;hould arrive in Leghorn.</P>
<P>The next day all hands were bu&s;y in making the nece&s;&s;ary arrangements for their departure: Eugenio, in a &s;ta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> of the utmo&s;t anxiety, thought it the longe&s;t of his lif<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">; nor were his friends le&s;s anxious. At two o'clock, the &s;ervants were di&s;patched for the bea&s;ts; at five, Eugenio and his man began to a&s;cend the mountain, and our hero and his friends waited their re|turn in calm &s;u&s;pence, as though &s;omething fatal hung on the event. The whole hemi&s;phere was involved in darkne&s;s, when Eugenio and his faithful &s;ervant arriv|ed at the place of a&s;&s;ignation. After waiting about half an hour, full of hopes and fears, Eugenio was re|lieved from all his anxiety, by the appearance of her whom he e&s;teemed more than empires: He cla&s;ped her in his arms with ecta&s;y, at the &s;ame time ex|claiming,
<PB N="180" REF="031902_0178_0FEF3D18B3756E70">
"And do I once more embrace my love! Thanks to all gracious heaven! Such bli&s;s would be cheaply purcha&s;ed with an age of toil and &s;u&s;pence." Terentia manife&s;ted her &s;atisfaction by the mo&s;t tender care&s;&s;es, and tears of joy.</P>
<P>After the fir&s;t emotions had &s;ub&s;ided, Eugenio turn|ed to her conductor, &s;aying, "And you, my much e&s;teemed friend! How &s;hall I ever reward your merit as it de&s;erves? You have rendered me a kindne&s;s which I can never repay. But (pulling out a pur&s;e of gold and pre&s;enting it) accept this trifling te&s;timony of my e&s;teem, until an opportunity &s;hall offer when I may have it in my power to do more ju&s;tice to your worth. " He refu&s;ed it peremptorily&mdash;per&s;ua&s;ions were vain, he would not touch a &s;ingle ducat, and it was with &s;ome difficulty that he was prevailed on to accept a ring which Eugenio forced on his finger, &s;aying, "Wear this, as a token of my friend&s;hip, till you return to Lon|don, when you mu&s;t return it; and I will &s;upply its place by &s;omething more worthy of your acceptance."</P>
<P>They then took an affectionate leave of each other and parted. Eugenio's man led the way bearing a ve|ry weighty ca&s;ket belonging to Terentia: They were a con&s;iderable time de&s;cending the mountain, but ar|rived &s;afely at George's ju&s;t as &s;upper was &s;erved up. Terentia was received with politene&s;s and affection; and, after re&s;ting her&s;elf a little, &s;at down to &s;upper with them. Preparation was in&s;tantly made for their
<PB N="181" REF="031902_0179_0FEF3D1FA84BC3F0">
departure, Mercutio and George undertook to equip Eugenio, and the ladies di&s;gui&s;ed Terentia, who con|&s;ented to per&s;onate I&s;abella's waiting woman. In the mean time, the &s;ervants &s;addled the hor&s;es and laid on the baggage, and, after imploring the a&s;&s;i&s;tance and protection of heaven, they mounted and &s;et forward.</P>
<P>They arrived at Leghorn without meeting with any material occurrence, where they were received with the mo&s;t unaffected cordiality by Mr. Wilcox and his amiable &s;pou&s;e, who, though &s;omewhat advanced in years, was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the mo&s;t perfect good nature, added to a &s;uperior degree of good &s;en&s;e, and a mo&s;t plea&s;ing vivacity combined with an elegant form and unacceptionable features.</P>
<P>Mr. Wilcox had two &s;ons, the elde&s;t commanded a &s;tout merchant &s;hip in the Levant trade; the younge&s;t was factor to his father, in Am&s;terdam; and two daughters, the younge&s;t was then in Holland with her brother; and the elde&s;t was married to George Wright.</P>
<P>The old gentleman had already provided a &s;hip to tran&s;port them to Holland, which he had freighted him&s;elf: He intended to remain in Am&s;terdam a few weeks, till his &s;on Robert &s;hould have di&s;po&s;ed of what merchandize he had on hand, expecting the re|turn of his other &s;on from the Levant, and then to re|turn to Liverpool with his whole family. They re|mained but ten days in Leghorn, for George having
<PB N="182" REF="031902_0180_0FEF3D215C268330">
informed his father and mother-in-law of the adventure of Eugenio and Terentia, they judged it the mo&s;t expe|dient to keep them in di&s;gui&s;e while on &s;hore, and to embark as &s;oon as convenient. In the mean time Mr. Wilcox and his &s;on-in-law were bu&s;y in &s;eeing their ef|fects embarked and &s;afely &s;towed on board the &s;hip. One day they found the captain engaged in di&s;cour&s;e with a &s;tranger, who &s;eemed to pre&s;s earne&s;tly for &s;ome favor: The Captain perceiving Mr. Wilcox, inter|rupted the &s;tranger, &s;omewhat ha&s;tily, &s;aying, here is the gentleman of whom I was &s;peaking, if he is willing to grant your reque&s;t I have not the lea&s;t objection.</P>
<P>"What is your reque&s;t Sir?" &s;aid Mr. Wilcox, in the mo&s;t unre&s;erved manner, "I &s;hall think my&s;elf happy in having it in my power to oblige a gentleman of your appearance, therefore pray let me hear your reque&s;t, and rely on my willingne&s;s to &s;erve you." "You do me a great deal of honour, Sir," &s;aid the &s;tranger, "and I cannot enough admire your frankne&s;s and genero&s;ity, in &s;o freely tendering me your &s;ervice. Not to keep you longer in &s;u&s;pence, I am a native of England, and have been tran&s;acting &s;ome affairs in Ita|ly for a certain nobleman in London: Having lately received letters from thence pre&s;&s;ing me to return on a very important affair, I am in ha&s;te to get thither. Af|ter having, in vain enquired for a ve&s;&s;el bound for En|gland, I was informed of this being &s;hortly to &s;ail for Holland; I therefore made application to the com|mander, who informs me, that you have already en|gaged
<PB N="183" REF="031902_0181_0FEF3D2381227F30">
his &s;hip entirely, and that without your con&s;ent he could not pretend to take any pa&s;&s;engers on board. Now Sir, if you will be kind enough to permit me to &s;ail with you to your de&s;tined port, as my affairs are very pre&s;&s;ing, I &s;hall e&s;teem it as a favor of the fir&s;t mag|nitude, and will comply with every requi&s;ite for my pa&s;|&s;age." "Say no more, &s;ir," &s;aid Mr. Wilcox: "You are not only welcome to your pa&s;&s;age, but, as I pro|mi&s;e my&s;elf much &s;atisfaction in your company, I &s;hall make that the only condition." "Your genero&s;ity," returned the &s;tranger, "demands all my gratitude, and you may re&s;t a&s;&s;ured of my eternal acknowledg|ment of the obligation." He would have proceeded, but Mr. Wilcox prevented him by informing him, that he intended to embark his family early the next morn|ing, and &s;ail whenever the wind &s;hould &s;erve, therefore, advi&s;ed him, if he had any bu&s;ine&s;s to tran&s;act<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">on &s;hore, to be as expeditious as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>They then politely took leave of each other; Mr. Wilcox and George returned to their friends, and the &s;tranger having no bu&s;ine&s;s on &s;hore, remained on board with the Captain.</P>
<P>Three hours before day, our little community aro&s;e, and being collected in the common apartment, united in imploring the protection of that God who gave them exi&s;tence, in their intended voyage. They then began to prepare for embarkation: Eugenio and Te|rentia put of their menial habits, and appeared in their
<PB N="184" REF="031902_0182_0FEF3D2A63D946D0">
proper characters. At dawn of day, being all ready, they &s;et forward towards the water-&s;ide, where they found the &s;hip's boat waiting. They embarked, and the &s;hip was immediately got under weigh: The can|va&s;s being &s;pread to the fre&s;h breeze, they were, in a few hours, wafted out of &s;ight of the city of Leghorn.</P>
<P>Soon after they went on board, Mr. Wilcox enquired for the &s;tranger, and was informed he was not &s;tirring yet. They were all &s;itting on the quarter deck, con|gratulating each other on the extreme plea&s;ant weather with which heaven had favoured them in the com|mencement of their voyage, when the &s;tranger appear|ed upon deck, and advancing, &s;aluted the whole compa|ny in the polite&s;t manner. But how &s;hall I paint the a&s;toni&s;hment of Eugenio, when in the per&s;on of the &s;tranger, he perceived his beloved tutor? He &s;prang forward, and eagerly embracing him, exclaimed aloud, "Do I behold, once more, my honoured, my much loved ma&s;ter, friend and companion, alive and at his liberty." Then falling on his knees, earne&s;tly intreated him to pardon the folly of his youth, which had nearly involved them both in irretreivable ruin.</P>
<P>"Ri&s;e my child," &s;aid his tutor, with a countenance that di&s;covered the goodne&s;s of his &s;oul, "and may heaven pardon every inadvertency of your future life as freely as I do this fir&s;t: As to the inconveniencies I may have met with &s;ince our &s;eperation, they were of no con&s;ideration with me, when compared with the
<PB N="185" REF="031902_0183_0FEF3D2BF81AF5F8">
anxiety I experienced on your particular account, le&s;t you &s;hould be di&s;covered. After all I am happy in the reflection of having your company to England; and of having in my power then to pre&s;ent you &s;afe to your noble parents."</P>
<P>"My dear &s;ir," replied the youth, "your genero|&s;ity, from our fir&s;t interview, has been familiar to me; but in this particular in&s;tance manife&s;ts it&s;elf in &s;o &s;uper|lative degree, that it leaves me a bankrupt, by confer|ring an obligation too va&s;t for me ever to acquit my|&s;elf of." He then took Terentia by the hand, and pre&s;ented her to his tutor, &s;aying, "behold, dear &s;ir the innocent, beloved cau&s;e of our late troubles; and &s;eal my pardon by admitting her to a &s;hare of your e&s;teem." The old gentleman prevented her from kneel|ing, by catching her in his arms, as &s;he was taking that po&s;ture: He a&s;&s;ured her of his warme&s;t friend&s;hip, adding, that he had never imputed the lea&s;t part of his late troubles to her intention. She declared her &s;a|tisfaction in being honoured with the regard of &s;o wor|thy a per&s;on; and promi&s;ed to re&s;pect him as one of her be&s;t friends. Breakfa&s;t interrupted the conver&s;a|tion for &s;ome time. When over, Mr. Savigny, Eu|genio's tutor, reque&s;ted of his pupil the particulars of his adventures &s;ince they parted in St. Marino. Euge|nio accordingly related, in the mo&s;t connect manner, every circum&s;tance, as it has been communicated to the reader already: Painting, in the mo&s;t &s;triking co|lours the favours he had experienced at the hands of
<PB N="186" REF="031902_0184_0FEF31C66AA22F40">
his new friends. "Mr. Savigny li&s;tened attentively to every part of his narrative, not without emotion, and when it was ended, remarked, that the hand of Providence had been vi&s;ibly exerted in favour of them both; adding, that nothing &s;hort of a complete affiance in the protection of the Supreme Being, could have encouraged him even to hope for an e&s;cape from the horrid dungeon in which he had been confined. The whole company then reque&s;ted a &s;imilar favour of Mr. Savigny.</P>
<P>"My adventures," &s;aid he, "in &s;o &s;hort a &s;pace, cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed to have been many or important; and though intere&s;ting to me, will afford neither plea|&s;ure nor amu&s;emement to the company pre&s;ent: Yet, it would argue the mo&s;t unpardonable ingrati|tude in me, to refu&s;e &s;o &s;light a gratification to per|&s;ons who have &s;o generou&s;ly contributed to my pre&s;ent happine&s;s, and that of my pupil, in &s;o exten&s;ive a lati|tude. The day I parted with you," turning to Euge|nio, "You know I &s;et out in company with our ho&s;t, in order, if po&s;&s;ible, to recover our hor&s;es. The per|&s;on in who&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion we found them, refu&s;ed to deliver them without a written order from the Governor or &s;ome of his hou&s;hold: We were much &s;urprized at this repul&s;e, and demanded his rea&s;ons. He an&s;wer|ed, that they were delivered to him by one of the Go|vernor's Eunuchs, who charged him to keep them &s;afely, feed them well, and that he &s;hould be amply rewarded; and moreover delivered him a billet from
<PB N="187" REF="031902_0185_0FEF3D2FD758E9D8">
the Governor's daughter:" (Here Terentia withdrew with I&s;abella,) "which contained peremptory orders not to deliver the hor&s;es to any per&s;on without the aforementioned order.</P>
<P>"This an&s;wer did but involve me in greater perplex|ity, for, what bu&s;ine&s;s the Governor of St. Marino could have with our hor&s;es, or how he came by them, was to me, an inexplicable my&s;tery. I told him the hor&s;es were mine, that I &s;u&s;pected he wi&s;hed to im|po&s;e on me; that the &s;tory he had vamped up appeared to me a fiction, and the note a forgery. I told him further, that if he would deliver up the hor&s;es immedi|ately, I &s;hould give my&s;elf no further trouble; if not, that I would make immediate application to the Go|vernor, and have him &s;everly puni&s;hed for his ob&s;tinacy.</P>
<P>"Finding that all I &s;aid had no effect, I left him, and with my landlord, returned to St. Marino, and &s;oon obtained an audience with his Excellency: This was the next day about ten o'clock. After having made my complaint, he promi&s;ed me ample &s;atisfac|tion and in&s;tantly di&s;patched an officer and twelve men with orders to bring the delinquent before him imme|diately. He was brought there in a few hours, when the Governor proceeded to interrogate him: He im|mediately produced the billet. The Governor having peru&s;ed it, a&s;ked who delivered him the hor&s;es? An|tonio, replied the pri&s;oner. He then a&s;ked him if
<PB N="188" REF="031902_0186_0FEF3D34A1D95050">
Antonio had a&s;&s;igned any rea&s;on for bringing them to him; he an&s;wered in the negative.</P>
<P>"The Eunuch was &s;ent for, and examined. He trembled exceedingly, his tongue faltered, and his an|&s;wers were &s;hort, broken and ambiguous. The Go|vernor commanded him to the torture&mdash;He confe&s;&s;ed the whole, corroborated what the pri&s;oner had &s;aid, and completely unravelled the whole affair. The Go|vernor, having obtained all the information the unfor|tunate Eunuch could give, ordered him to be &s;trangled: My feelings revolted at this piece of cruelty, and I could not refrain &s;oliciting pardon for the trembling victim; but in vain: He flew into a violent rage and began to interrogate the landlord and me concerning you, at which we were a&s;toni&s;hed, not doubting but you was &s;till at our lodgings.</P>
<P>"In vain we a&s;&s;ured him we had neither &s;een nor heard from you &s;ince we had &s;et out in &s;earch of the hor&s;es: He in&s;i&s;ted our an&s;wers were all eva&s;ions; that we had all con&s;pired together to rob him of his daughter, and perhaps his life. One mi&s;creant, &s;aid he, has atoned for his crimes by death, and, if that heretic, meaning you, is not &s;peedily di&s;covered, you may re&s;t a&s;&s;ured of a &s;imilar fate: Drag them away, &s;aid he to the keeper of the pri&s;on, confine them clo&s;ely; if you &s;uffer them to e&s;cape, your life &s;hall pay the forfeit.</P>
<P><PB N="189" REF="031902_0187_0FEF3D39157EFDA0">"Accordingly we were conveyed to the common pri|&s;on, where we were confined in a mo&s;t horrid dungeon, denied the benefit of light or air, and in continual ex|pectation of being &s;trangled or broke on the wheel. The &s;econd day of our impri&s;onment, the landlord was relea&s;ed, in order (as the goaler has &s;ince informed me) to detect, if po&s;&s;ible, you or your &s;ervant, who it was &s;uppo&s;ed, would be keeping a look out for me. Dreary as my habitation, and gloomy as my future pro&s;pect was, my ardent prayer to heaven was, that I might be permitted to endure the utmo&s;t vengeance of the Governor, rather then you &s;hould be di&s;covered.</P>
<P>"One night, as I lay, enveloped in the mo&s;t gloomy darkne&s;s, ruminating on my unhappy &s;ituation, and praying for your &s;afety, I thought I heard &s;omebody di&s;cour&s;ing in a very low key. I rai&s;ed my head and li&s;tened very attentively.&mdash;I &s;oon perceived, through a very &s;mall crevice, the Goaler and a per&s;on in a cano|nical habit (who afterwards proved to be the Friar who married you) in clo&s;e conver&s;ation together: They were forming a plan for abandoning the pri&s;on the en&s;uing night, and to po&s;t away to the dominions of Spain with all po&s;&s;ible &s;peed.</P>
<P>"Hopele&s;s as my &s;ituation was, a ray of hope darted through my &s;oul with the idea of converting the di&s;co|very to my own advantage.

events, I re&s;olved to hint the matter to the Goaler, let him know I had di&s;covered their whole plan, and final|ly, reque&s;t a participation in their adventure: I was encouraged to this mea&s;ure by an idea that he would never (if he could help it) return to Italy, con&s;e|quently would be regardle&s;s of the con&s;equences which might attend his elopement: He might al&s;o be appre|hen&s;ive of my di&s;covering their rout.</P>
<P>"I &s;lept very little that night, and that little was interrupted by dreams, by no means agreeable, and when I awoke, my heart palpitated violently; my whole frame was much agitated, tho' uncon&s;cious of any crime, either committed or meditated.</P>
<P>"Morning, if the appearance of the Goaler may be termed &s;o; for light never intruded my apartment, at length di&s;pelled the perturbation of my mind; my keeper appeared more civil than ordinary, which I in|terpreted as a good omen.

How happy &s;hould I be now, could I be permitted to b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eathe, once more the fre&s;h air! Once more enjoy the light of heaven!&mdash;But alas! I am, I fear, if not to &s;uffer an ignominious death, doomed to linger out the remainder of my days in this loath|&s;ome

d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n, excluded from the &s;ociety of men, with a mind tortured with the mo&s;t racking anxiety, without having committed even the &s;hadow of a crime.</P>
<P>"I really commi&s;erate your di&s;tre&s;s, but you know, &s;aid he, the nature of my employment will not admit of my contributing to the alleviation of it. Oh y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s, an&s;wered I, it is in your power to re&s;cue me from the impending mi&s;chief which awaits me. If you intended to remain here, I &s;hould not put your fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">elity to the trial. He appeared much embarra&s;&s;ed. But be not offended nor &s;urprized, when I inform you, that your intentions are well known to me: I overheard every word that pa&s;t between you and the reverend father la&s;t night; and all I reque&s;t in con&s;equence is, that you will admit me a partner in your intended enterprize.</P>
<P>"His countenance changed, and he was about to re|ply; but I prevented him, by &s;aying, only reflect, my dear friend, on the con&s;equences re&s;ulting from your elopement: You &s;ee how rigorou&s;ly I am already trea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, without any cau&s;e, and is it not more than probable that when the Governor is informed of the &s;tep you have taken, he will wreak his whole vengeance on me:&mdash;I &s;ee humanity in your countenance&mdash;I am convinced you have not a wi&s;h to be acce&s;&s;ary to my death, which will inevitably follow your departure. Oh con&s;ider this, my dear friend, &s;aid I, taking his hand, you are &s;en&s;ible my pre&s;ent confinement is un|merited; therefore, let me take my lot with you this

night, let what will befal me, I will be your everla&s;t|ing friend.&mdash;Here I pau&s;ed. Your reque&s;t &s;hall be granted, &s;aid he, I am going to Father John now; and will return to you &s;hortly; in the mean time, make your&s;elf ea&s;y: If we &s;ucceed, this night you &s;hall be at your liberty; if not, inevitable ruin attends us all.</P>
<P>"He left me, and I mu&s;t confe&s;s I wronged him; for I was doubtful of his integrity: He returned, how|ever, according to his promi&s;e, and informed me, that he had con&s;ulted with the Holy father; that he was well &s;atisfied for me to accompany them to &s;ome di&s;|tance from the town; but that then I mu&s;t &s;hift for my&s;elf.&mdash;I will, continued he, furni&s;h you with a hor&s;e of my own, which you may di&s;po&s;e of as you think proper, and twenty ducats to bear your ex|pences till you are out of danger. With the&s;e words he pre&s;ented me with this pur&s;e, (&s;howing it) containing the afore&s;aid &s;um and this dagger: You may, perhaps, find this your be&s;t friend, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">aid he. Farewell&mdash;hold your&s;elf in readine&s;s&mdash;doubt nothing.</P>
