<HEAD>LETTER I. From Mi&s;s <HI>POLLY GRANVILLE,</HI> to Mi&s;s SOPHIA DANIELSON.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Mi&s;s Sophia,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU know that Mr. Danford, of late, has paid his addre&s;&s;es to me; and you know, likewi&s;e, that he is a man worthy of any body's e&s;teem. I am &s;ure he had engaged all my affections; and we had got &s;o far in our court&s;hip, that we had promi&s;ed marriage to each other: But my father, for &s;ome family conve|nience, hath engaged Mr. Stapleton to addre&s;s me. Now Mr. Stapleton is very wealthy, but he is quite ill looking: I believe you never &s;aw him. Well, I will try to let you know how he looks. He is a tall figure of a man; has very large coar&s;e features, and a dead looking eye; with hollow cheeks, large irreg|ular teeth, and a mouth no ways be&s;peaking approba|tion. Indeed he is a frightful looking man as to his per&s;on. He is, be&s;ides, of a violent temper, and hath no con&s;ideration in any matter what&s;oever. He &s;peaks quick, and talks much, without &s;en&s;e, or method; is quite a libertine; is very fond of company; and no company comes ami&s;s to him. And, indeed, he is altogether a debauchee. Now could you think your Polly could be fond of &s;uch an alliance? No. What, to exchange Mr. Danford, who has every per&s;onal qualification, for &s;uch a creature as this? No, I won't! for I will die fir&s;t! Be&s;ides, I would not break my
<PB N="6" REF="033734_0004_0FF8BF66EBBD8A50">
promi&s;e, that is of &s;uch a nature, for all the world&punc; and there is nothing &s;hall tempt me to break it!</P>
<P>My mother and I have had a long di&s;cour&s;e on the &s;ubject, and I find I am not to expect much favour from my father in this affair; and my mother &s;eems to &s;ide with him, at pre&s;ent. I will &s;end you the di&s;|cour&s;e I had with my mother; which was nearly as follows:</P>
<P>My mother called me to her, and upon my &s;eating my&s;elf by her, &s;aid, Polly, do you intend to favour the addre&s;&s;es of Mr. Danford any longer, or have you di&s;mi&s;&s;ed him already? Dear mamma, &s;aid I, I have not di&s;mi&s;&s;ed him at pre&s;ent; and why &s;hould I? I hope you have no objections to his vi&s;its; have you? Yes, Polly, &s;aid my mother, I have: and if I &s;hould only tell you that it is di&s;agreeable to me, it ought to be a &s;ufficient rea&s;on for you to di&s;mi&s;s him. But I will give you &s;ome rea&s;ons why I wi&s;h you to break with him. It is high time that you knew your own importance. For prithee, child, don't you know that you are nobly de&s;cended; that our family is one of the olde&s;t in the country; and that your father is very wealthy, having a large e&s;tate in his hands; is im|men&s;ely rich in money and lands; and carries on an exten&s;ive trade at &s;ea; and is called one of the fir&s;t men on the continent? Now Mr. Danford's circum|&s;tances being but moderate, no ways equal to yours, it cannot be thought that you will &s;toop &s;o low as to re|ceive his vi&s;its; much le&s;s to encourage any further alliance with him. It is therefore your father's plea&s;|ure that you break with him; and &s;o it is mine. For your &s;i&s;ter Jenny married a man that was exceeding wealthy, and you was always looked upon above her, both in beauty and accompli&s;hments of mind, and it is in your power to make the riche&s;t man in the coun|try happy: So I hope you will not di&s;plea&s;e your fa|ther nor vex me, for I never had a child that I &s;et more by than I do by you. Neither &s;hould try harder to make any child happier in a wealthy marriage, than I &s;hould you. And now, I think I have given you &s;ufficient rea&s;ons, why I think it will be be&s;t for you
<PB N="7" REF="033734_0005_0FF8F07D32FD3130">
to break with him. And I am &s;ure I would not ad|vi&s;e you to any thing that is not for your good.</P>
<P>Dear ma'am, &s;aid I, you greatly &s;urpri&s;e me; for I had not the lea&s;t thought that Mr. Danford was di&s;|gu&s;tful to you; for you never hinted a &s;yllable of it to me before&mdash;and he engro&s;&s;es all my attention. And my inclination is too &s;trongly bia&s;&s;ed in his favour to admit of an alteration. Neither can I &s;ee why you &s;hould de&s;pi&s;e him: For Mr. Danford is every thing that I could po&s;&s;ibly wi&s;h for in a man. He is of a noble mind, is above every little action&mdash;is of a kind and affable di&s;po&s;ition, and has a heart not ungenerous. He &s;eems to be formed both to defend and love the other &s;ex; and indeed there is nothing of meanne&s;s in him: For he has acquired great honour in the &s;er|vice of his country, as a public officer; and is in po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of a good e&s;tate, his circum&s;tances being quite ea&s;y. And indeed great riches never had &s;uch charms with me! 'Tis true, where there is riches, it enables one to be kind and benevolent to the poor and needy. But to love riches for the &s;ake of grandeur, and that only, characterizes a low and little mind, and bor|ders on &s;elfi&s;h &s;tupidity. But, ma'am, you know that I always was of a &s;erious turn of mind, and I think I have &s;ome love for religion; nor do I confine my ideas of happine&s;s to this world; but my &s;chemes of happi|ne&s;s are chiefly beyond the grave. Now, Mr. Dan|ford is of a con&s;onant turn of mind, being a great lov|er of religion, which is beautifully mixed in all his di&s;cour&s;e; and, in my mind, &s;ets him above the riche&s;t man on earth, who is void of his qualifications. And then, when he talks of love, or marriage, it is with that open frankne&s;s, that ever denotes the noble mind. And from him, you never hear any of that frantic di&s;order of &s;peech: but per&s;ua&s;ion &s;eems to dwell on his tongue, in a ju&s;t and noble manner. And can you think, that &s;uch an alliance as this can be di&s;agreeable to me? An alliance that will not end at death, but will endure when the &s;un and moon &s;hall forget to &s;hine? O what a rich thought is this; that we may be mutual helps to each other in this world, and then be removed to the realms of joy and happi|ne&s;s,
<PB N="8" REF="033734_0006_0FF8F08502D8B6C8">
never to be parted again! And would you de|prive me of the anticipation of all this happine&s;s, and &s;ink me below the du&s;t? For I never &s;hall be happy with any other man; becau&s;e we have pledged our&s;elves to each other. And as for Mr. Murfee, who married Jenny, 'tis true, he is in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a large e&s;tate; but then, he is altogether a man of this world. And indeed he is nothing more than a fa&s;hionable rake&mdash; a profe&s;&s;ed libertine. If &s;he feels her&s;elf happy with him, it is well. But it is hardly &s;uppo&s;able that &s;he does? But if we may judge by appearances, &s;he is very unea&s;y in her mind; and does not rejoice in her noble marriage: And now, would you have me tied to another, &s;uch as Mr. Murfee is? If I was, I &s;hould bid farewel to all enjoyments in this world; and mo&s;t &s;et down mi&s;erable for life: And then, what avail would riches and grandeur be to me? Why, they would only &s;erve to heighten my mi&s;ery, and augment the troubles of life to a greater degree.</P>
<P>Polly, &s;aid my mother, you &s;eem to branch out ve|ry largely; but I hope you are not in earne&s;t: for your father, of late, had &s;ome overtures made to him by Mr. Stapleton on your account; which I think cannot be di&s;agreeable to you. For he is a very wealthy man, indeed; there is hardly any end to his riches. And he is a man well enough as to other qualifications. And now what objections can you have to him?</P>
<P>Dear mamma, &s;aid I, don't mention Mr. Stapleton to me for &s;uch an alliance; for he is a frightful look|ing man, and has nothing attractive in his behaviour; being quite void of that tenderne&s;s to be found in ma|ny others. And then there is nothing noble in his mind, or generous in his temper. And indeed, he &s;eems to be formed by nature for a mere tyrant. For having a churli&s;h ungovernable temper, and not hav|ing &s;en&s;e enough to know right from wrong; he is many times in a pa&s;&s;ion, without knowing what he is angry at. And, above all, he is a great libertine, car|ing for nothing but debauchery. Now, could you have a &s;ingle thought of &s;uch a man for your Polly? Dear ma'am, you cannot! For I had rather live a
<PB N="9" REF="033734_0007_0FF8F0874362AB30">
&s;ingle life all my days, or marry a man without any e&s;tate at all, provided he is endowed with per&s;onal qualifications, than to have him. For it is ea&s;ier for a poor man, thus qualified, to attain to an e&s;tate, than for a rich, &s;elfi&s;h clown, to attain to tho&s;e qualifications. So I hope you won't mention him to me any more.</P>
<P>Well, Polly, &s;aid my mother, you had better think &s;eriou&s;ly of the matter; for your father is determined that Mr. Danford &s;hall not continue his vi&s;its; and has wrote him a line to forbid him our hou&s;e. I I think you had better encourage the addre&s;&s;es of Mr. Stapleton; for your father is &s;et upon it, to give him all the aid in his power. For there is to be &s;ome ex|change of property between your father and Mr. Sta|pleton, in con&s;equence of your marriage, which will be very advantageous to our family. And &s;o, I fear, he is too much &s;et to be turned. For Mr. Stapleton being very wealthy, he thinks 'twill reflect great hon|our on the family. But I &s;hall not &s;ay any more to you at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>Dear ma'am, &s;aid I, let me ju&s;t an&s;wer you before you withdraw. Then the matter is concluded alrea|dy, I find. And I am to be &s;old to Mr. Stapleton, to be his &s;lave. For if I am married to him, no other &s;hall I be, I warrant. But I never will be neither his wife, nor &s;lave! For if I cannot have a man of my own choo&s;ing, I had rather never alter my con|dition. But if I am ever married, Mr. Danford mu&s;t be the man: indeed he mu&s;t! Dear mamma, do &s;tand my friend! And don't in&s;i&s;t on my breaking with Mr. Danford, for my life depends upon it! and if you are not my friend, I am wholly de&s;titute of any except Mr. Danford. And you &s;ay I am not to &s;ee him again. O &s;hocking! Then I am to be plunged into di&s;tre&s;s and mi&s;ery at an early age. And how can you &s;ay that you love me above any of your rela|tions, when you do not care what befals me? Which denotes you don't love me at all. But you will love your Polly yet, will you not? And will you not try to per&s;uade my father to deal otherwi&s;e by me?&mdash; But if you will for&s;ake me, I have no where to go but to a merciful God; on who&s;e care and protection I
<PB N="10" REF="033734_0008_0FF8F08D1F89B330">
will ever venture my&s;elf, hoping he will not lay more on me, than I am able to bear.</P>
<P>At this my mother withdrew, and now what have I to expect but hard treatment? Well, 'tis hard to di&s;obey parents; but, as for my marrying Mr. Staple|ton, I never will, let what will come of it. Neither will I marry any other man whil&s;t Mr. Danford is living. For how can I, we having promi&s;ed each other not to? which promi&s;es I hold to be &s;acred; and that no body hath a right to revoke them. And &s;o you &s;ee, that I am &s;tedfa&s;tly &s;et, to hold my pro|mi&s;e with Mr. Danford. But I cannot tell yet how it will be brought about.</P>
<P>By this time you will think it is time for me to con|clude, which I do by &s;ending you my kind regards.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER II. From Mr. <HI>DANFORD,</HI> to Mi&s;s <HI>POLLY GRANVILLE.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My dear Mi&s;s Polly,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AND am I forbidden to vi&s;it you? Yes, I received a line from your father, which forbids me his hou&s;e. On what account I cannot tell; but have heard, by the bye, that it is becau&s;e my e&s;tate is not large enough. And I hear farther, that Mr. Staple|ton is encouraged to vi&s;it you; and I &s;uppo&s;e his e&s;|tate is &s;ufficient, and that is all he has to recommend him. But I &s;hould not think that my Polly (you &s;ee that I call you mine yet) would take up with &s;uch a wretch as Mr. Stapleton, who is void of every good quality. And then, my dear, what have I done to your father? For if I am guilty of any enormity that
<PB N="11" REF="033734_0009_0FF8F08F5A063F28">
is offen&s;ive to him, if he will but hint it to me, I will amend; and &s;hall be very proud to gain his affections at any rate, let it co&s;t me what it will. And indeed, I &s;hould be willing to &s;eek danger in the face of &s;tub|born foes, if that would reconcile him to me. But I fear his di&s;gu&s;t is of another nature. For I believe that nothing but money is wanting. As for an e&s;tate, I have enough of that to make us comfortable, and I don't think we ought to let the world engro&s;s all our de&s;ires.</P>
<P>And now, my dear, are your affections alienated from me? Or have you forgot me? You u&s;ed to &s;ay that you had &s;ome e&s;teem for me, and that I was delightful to you. And indeed you promi&s;ed to be mine, let what would be the con&s;equence. And may not I expect a line from you to inform me of the &s;tate of your mind towards me. As to my&s;elf, my love to you is, and ever will be, the &s;ame it ever was. Don't think that ab&s;ence will, or can efface it. No; but if the &s;un &s;hould forget to &s;hine, or the rivers for|get to flow, then might I forget my Polly Granville, but not otherwi&s;e. Nor will the trials and troubles of this world make me unmindful of you. And I am re&s;olved never to marry any other whil&s;t you are liv|ing. But how you will behave your&s;elf to me, is yet uncertain. But I always did depend on your word and promi&s;e, and think I may yet.</P>
<P>As for an e&s;tate, don't let that trouble you; for if your father &s;hould di&s;inherit you, yet I have a com|petence of this world; and if I can but have your per&s;on, I do not care whether your father gives you any thing or not. For riches, ab&s;tractly of them&s;elves, will never make a per&s;on happy; and I ever loved you more for the beauties of your mind, than any thing el&s;e. Your being of an open temper, that ever &s;ets the noble above the low minded, and having a love for virtue and religion, and not confining your ideas of happine&s;s wholly to this world, greatly height|ened you in my e&s;teem, for I am my&s;elf, of a con&s;o|nant turn of mind. How plea&s;ing was the anticipa|tion of the&s;e things to me; that we &s;hould be able to give advice and coun&s;el to one another, which would
<PB N="12" REF="033734_0010_0FF8F093404722F0">
mutually heighten the thoughts of heaven, even whil&s;t in this &s;tate of change and vici&s;&s;itude; and finally, that our friend&s;hip &s;hould not end at death, but that we &s;hould be partakers of that ble&s;&s;edne&s;s which is laid up for tho&s;e who make virtue their chief aim.&mdash; But I cannot, and will not give you up as lo&s;t to me yet, For there are many intricate windings in life, which appear to us to be wholly again&s;t us; yet at the &s;ame time are working together for our good. And the per&s;on that puts his tru&s;t wholly in a divine Providence, is &s;eldom di&s;appointed. For Providence can overcome all the&s;e &s;eemingly untoward ob&s;tacles, and make them all turn to our advantage; and then we can can look back with delight on tho&s;e &s;eeming afflictions, and can &s;ee how they did work together for our good.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IS it po&s;&s;ible that you &s;hould di&s;tru&s;t the love and fidelity of your Polly? No, I'll not harbour &s;uch a thought&mdash;I think you are not capable of &s;uch a thing. And do you a&s;k whether my love is the &s;ame towards you? I an&s;wer, no; for the unthought-of trials that I have met with of late, have greatly heightened my love and affection to you. My e&s;teem for you is altogether unalterable, and my heart is fix|ed.
<PB N="13" REF="033734_0011_0FF8F099C5562A48">
Neither is there any thing in this world that &s;hall alienate my affections from you; and you may a&s;&s;ure your&s;elf that I am unalterably yours, and never will I marry any other man whil&s;t you are living: Let the trials and trouble I meet with be ever &s;o great, yet I will never break this re&s;olution. For you can|not think that I &s;et &s;o light by the promi&s;e I made you as to break it, for any con&s;ideration what&s;oever. But I have experienced great troubles, and heavy tri|als, &s;ince I &s;aw you, which are on your account: and I expect they are not at an end yet. But this con&s;idera|tion makes them the lighter, that they are on your ac|count: and I am willing to &s;uffer greater trials for your &s;ake, if I can but obtain your per&s;on. So you may &s;ee by this that you are no ways indifferent to me; but that you engro&s;s my whole attention, as to the things of this world; my worldly happine&s;s being wholly centered in you.</P>
<P>I would give you, if I could, a &s;ketch of my trou|bles. My father hath forbid my receiving your vi&s;its, and I &s;uppo&s;e forbidden you his hou&s;e, and hath like|wi&s;e propo&s;ed Mr. Stapleton to me as a &s;uitor; but I have utterly refu&s;ed to have any thing to &s;ay to Mr. Stapleton on &s;uch an account. And have peremtori|ly declared, that if I could not be favored with an alli|ance with you, I would never alter my condition: which &s;eems to rai&s;e great anger in my father: for it &s;eems (tho' it is hard to &s;ay it of one's parents) that my father &s;ets more by riches, than he does by the peace and quiet of his children. It &s;eems that Mr. Stapleton is to pay me a vi&s;it; but it will be labour lo&s;t; I can tell them that: for I am determined not to have any thing to &s;ay to him on the &s;ubject; and I will warrant, he will get nothing but frowns from me. For if my affections were not fixed already, I could not think of Mr. Stapleton for a companion&mdash;indeed I could not; for he is no ways engaging to me, nei|ther in per&s;on or behaviour. And then his mind is altogether naughty; and, in my view, he is not in po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of one good quality. So, if I was not bia&s;&s;ed in your favour, you may &s;ee he would not be likely to make a conque&s;t of me. But to return; my father
<PB N="14" REF="033734_0012_0FF8BF71A85D1D58">
hath not confined me to my chamber yet; though he &s;ays he will, if I don't comply with his propo&s;al. But I have liberty of the garden, and to vi&s;it, having one of the family with me, to &s;ee that I am not in your company. I am al&s;o allowed to write; and my maid being wholly on my &s;ide, I can convey my letters when, and where I plea&s;e: So you may leave your letters, and &s;he will call for them.</P>
<P>Your letter to me revived my &s;pirits greatly. To think, that you don't de&s;pi&s;e, nor forget me in this trouble, is a great con&s;olation to me. And your hint, that "they who put their tru&s;t in Providence, will not be di&s;appointed," gave me great encouragement; for my whole dependence is on a kind indulgent Providence; in who&s;e hands I am willing to venture my&s;elf, and all my concerns. Ever praying that he will not lay greater trials on me than he &s;hall enable me to bear, and that I may, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, be blamele&s;s.</P>

Well, I have a great many &s;trange things to tell you, for I am u&s;ed with great &s;everity by my parents; who try all in their pow|er to make me break with Mr. Danford, and favour
<PB N="15" REF="033734_0013_0FF8F09E5520E3C8">
Mr. Stapleton&punc; but I utterly refu&s;e to do either, which vexes them greatly.</P>
<P>Mr. Stapleton has paid us a vi&s;it, and you will wi&s;h to know how I behaved my&s;elf with my new lover, and how he conducted in the bu&s;ine&s;s. Why, I be|lieve that we both behaved quite aukwardly. I am &s;ure he did; and I have not much to &s;ay for my&s;elf. Well, as my mother and I were &s;itting in the parlour, who &s;hould enter but my papa, and Mr. Stapleton with him, which put me in a terrible &s;lutter. My papa introduced him to my mother, and then to me; and I aro&s;e to receive him&mdash;but tremble, tremble, went my feet, &s;o that I could hardly &s;tand. I hope, &s;aid he, I &s;ee you well, Mi&s;s Polly: very well, Sir, &s;aid I; but did not &s;ay, at your &s;ervice, you may well think. Well, he &s;eated him&s;elf not far from me, and &s;eemed as if his &s;eat was unea&s;y to him. Now turning to this &s;ide, now to that; and &s;eemed to be at a lo&s;s what to &s;ay. But my father and mother put him out of his pain, by withdrawing: my father &s;ay|ing, as he went out, well, Polly, I have engaged Mr. Stapleton to vi&s;it you, and I hope you will receive him kindly; and that you will be agreeable to him, and he to you. While my father addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to me, I &s;tood up, and when he had done, I courte&s;ied, and &s;et down again; and was in hopes, that when I &s;hould tell Mr. Stapleton how the matter &s;tood be|tween Mr. Danford and my&s;elf, that he would relin|qui&s;h all his pretentions to me, and would try to help me out of my pre&s;ent difficulty. But in this I found my&s;elf mi&s;taken; for the more I expo&s;tulated with him, the more he would claim his right by my father's engagement; &s;o I was re&s;olved to u&s;e him very plain|ly, and to let him know, that I was determined to ad|here to my promi&s;e to Mr. Danford. Well, as to our di&s;cour&s;e; after I had &s;eated my&s;elf, he moved his &s;eat nearer to me, and acco&s;ted me as follows:</P>
<P>Well, Mi&s;s Polly, your father hath engaged me to addre&s;s you, and I hope that my vi&s;its will meet with your approbation; for I &s;hould be fond of an alliance with your family; and I hope I &s;hall make my&s;elf as agreeable to you, as you are to me.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="033734_0014_0FF8F0A49BD4CD38">Sir, &s;aid I, if it were in my power to receive your vi&s;its, I &s;hould be very glad to on my father's account, who hath given you the trouble to call upon me. But as I have a prior engagement, I hope you will ex|cu&s;e me, Sir, when I tell you, that I cannot di&s;cour&s;e with you on the &s;ubject. And I have more depend|ence on your honour, Sir, than to think that you will try to make a young defencele&s;s creature break her promi&s;e with another man. For you know, Sir, that &s;uch an engagement is &s;olemn, and ought to be held &s;acred. And I have great dependence on your hon|our, Sir, in this affair; expecting you will not in&s;i&s;t on my favouring your preten&s;ions; and hope you will &s;ay no more to me on that &s;ubject.</P>
<P>As I &s;aid before, he is quite an unpolite gentleman, wherefore breaking in upon me, he &s;aid, ma'am&punc; ma'am!&mdash;if you are agreeable to Mr. Danford, why &s;hould not you be &s;o to me? And no doubt, if Mr. Danford is agreeable to you, I can make my&s;elf equally agreeable. For we all know that affections are transferable. And be&s;ides, I am va&s;tly above Mr. Danford in every point of view. So I am no ways concerned, but that you will like me, in a little time, as well as you do him.</P>
<P>But Mr. Stapleton, &s;aid I, what &s;hall I do with the promi&s;e I have made to Mr. Danford? for I have pledged my&s;elf to him in a &s;olemn manner; and if I &s;hould break that promi&s;e, I &s;hould be afraid that &s;omething uncommon would befal me. And what can you &s;ay to this?</P>
<P>Love-promi&s;es, &s;aid he, are nothing but words of cour&s;e, and I have made a dozen of them in my life|time; but never thought them binding. And if you have made a promi&s;e to Mr. Danford, you know the form now: and &s;o you may make another to me, and I will do the &s;ame to you, and we will join our hands at the church, and then the matter will be &s;ettled, and who can call you to an account about it?</P>
<P>Mr. Stapleton, &s;aid I, you &s;urpri&s;e me! Do you make thus light of &s;olemn promi&s;es? If the&s;e are your &s;entiments, what &s;ecurity could a woman have with you? why you put me quite out of conceit of
<PB N="17" REF="033734_0015_0FF8F0A9751032B0">
the other &s;ex. But I hope they are not all of your turn of mind. And I am under the nece&s;&s;ity of telling you, that you are no ways plea&s;ing to me; therefore wi&s;h you to withdraw, and not di&s;turb me with &s;uch di&s;cour&s;e&mdash;for I mu&s;t tell you, that I have no liking to you. And indeed, Sir, if I was not engaged, I could not think of a man of your &s;entiments for a com|panion&mdash;indeed I could not! And now, as I have been &s;o plain with you, I hope you will give me no more trouble in this affair: for we being not of a con&s;onant turn of mind, cannot be agreeable to each other.</P>
<P>Well, &s;aid Mr. Stapleton, I &s;hall not give up my preten&s;ions to you, for your father and I have &s;ettled the whole matter; and he having a right to command you, I &s;hall depend upon his authority, and expect a &s;peedy marriage. For I have engaged &s;o far in the affair, that I cannot ea&s;ily give it up: and &s;o you may as well comply, as not.</P>
<P>Sir, &s;aid I, may not I depend on your honour, when I tell you, that I cannot love you, and that you are wholly di&s;agreeable to me? If I &s;hould con&s;ent to give you my hand, what a life &s;hould we be likely to live together? For, where there is no love, there can be no confidence: and then we might both re|pent our proceedings when it would be too late.</P>
<P>I am, &s;aid he, not at all concerned about that. For it is a wife's duty, to obey her hu&s;band. And I &s;hall take care of that in the fir&s;t place, and then look out for your affections afterwards. And it will be &s;trange, if you cannot both love and e&s;teem me&mdash;for I have a large e&s;tate; and, you know, where there is riches, there mu&s;t be contentment of mind. So I have no doubt, but, in time, you will both love and re&s;pect me; and I am re&s;olved to venture the con&s;equence, and doubt not, that we &s;hall be married &s;oon.</P>
<P>Mr. Stapleton, &s;aid I, you may rely upon it, that I will never be your wife whil&s;t I am living&mdash;neith|er do I intend to talk any more with you about the matter. Indeed, I did depend &s;ome upon your hon|our, but I find that you are void of that qualification. And to &s;how you that I am in earne&s;t in all that I
<PB N="18" REF="033734_0016_0FF8F0AECD77F3C8">
have &s;aid, I &s;hall this moment withdraw, and leave you by your&s;elf, hoping you will make proper reflec|tions on what hath been &s;aid, and that you will give me no more trouble:</P>
<P>And &s;o I retired to my chamber. But my father and he had a long conference, after I withdrew. And, by what I can find out, by the bye, my father is determined to u&s;e all his authority, to make me comply with his propo&s;al. And, I believe, he told Mr. Stapleton as much&mdash;for &s;ince that time, he u&s;es me more like a &s;tranger than a child: only with this difference, that he is not &s;o polite with me, as he is with others.</P>
<P>When we &s;at down to tea, after Mr. Stapleton was gone&mdash;we having no company, his di&s;cour&s;e was whol|ly about the above affair; and he &s;aid, I was altogeth|er unpolite to Mr. Stapleton; but if I did not behave my&s;elf better to him, the next time he vi&s;ited me, he would u&s;e his authority with me: and if that would not make me bend, he &s;hould take &s;uch mea&s;ures with me, as would be very di&s;tre&s;&s;ing, both for him to in|flict, and for me to bear.</P>
<P>I thought it be&s;t for me not to an&s;wer him, &s;o made no reply to what he &s;aid; but &s;oon retired to my chamber again, and wrote you the re&s;ult.</P>
<P>And now, ma'am, what mu&s;t I expect? Nothing but hard words and angry looks from them that ought to deal mo&s;t kindly and tenderly by me. But I did not think my mother capable of hard-heart|edne&s;s: for &s;he u&s;ed to be very kind to me; indeed, &s;he never gave me an angry word before this affair happened. But I intend to have another di&s;cour&s;e with her. Pray, my dear Mi&s;s Sophia, write to me, and tell me how one ought to behave to parents in &s;uch a ca&s;e as mine. I know one ought to obey parents in all things: But when Mr. Danford fir&s;t addre&s;&s;ed me, my parents &s;eemed to encourage me in the affair; and now when my inclination has got &s;trongly bia&s;&s;ed in his favour, and we have promi&s;ed marriage to each other&mdash;and all done, as it were, through their concur|rence, they can have no right, I think, to in&s;i&s;t upon my breaking with him, and admitting the vi&s;its of
<PB N="19" REF="033734_0017_0FF8F0B1069C6200">
another, who is altogether di&s;agreeable to me. There|fore, I think I &s;hall not be altogether wrong, if I do di&s;obey them in this point, for my worldly happine&s;s does depend on it, and I fear it will go far in breaking my peace with heaven. For, dear ma'am, we &s;hould, in all our &s;chemes of worldly happine&s;s, make &s;ome provi&s;ion for the better part; and not let the world infringe on the affairs of the &s;oul and eternal happi|ne&s;s. But in my mind, to be joined to &s;uch an aban|doned man, is, in effect, to bid farewel to all &s;erious thoughts, and is for&s;aking religion entirely. But do, dear Mi&s;s Sophia, &s;end me your thoughts on this &s;ub|ject; and if I am wrong, don't &s;pare me; but give me your mind upon the matter plainly; for I am a young defencele&s;s creature, and I &s;eem to have no mor|tal to a&s;k advice of but you at pre&s;ent. So I will con|clude by &s;ending you my be&s;t wi&s;hes.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER V. From Mi&s;s <HI>SOPHIA DANIELSON</HI> to Mi&s;s POLLY GRANVILLE.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My Dear Mi&s;s Polly,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I RECEIVED your two la&s;t letters which gave me much pain for you. And I do lament your ca&s;e, and heartily &s;ympathize with you in your misfortunes. Your troubles &s;eem to come fa&s;t upon you, and from a quarter that I little expected. For your father and mother u&s;ed to &s;how you all that tenderne&s;s, which is the effect of real paternal affection. Nay, I often thought, that they were partial in your favor; and it &s;eemed as if you could not do a wrong thing, in their view. Your mother, e&s;pecially, was, I thought, a kind and
<PB N="20" REF="033734_0018_0FF8F0B5F7EE1998">
tender hearted woman; and &s;eemed to have a feeling for any who were in di&s;tre&s;s. But your father, I always thought was a great lover of the world. Indeed, wealth &s;eemed to engro&s;s his whole attention; and he could ea&s;ily forego any thing for riches. But I did not think he was capable of &s;uch conduct to his Polly. Indeed I could not have thought it of him. What! reject Mr. Danford, who is in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a good e&s;tate; is quite a polite gentleman, endowed with every ac|compli&s;hment to be found either in the intrepid or gentle? And then to encourage Mr. Stapleton to vi&s;|it you, wholly upon the &s;core of riches, is to me quite unaccountable. And to join his authority with his pro|po&s;al, and try to compel you to break with the one, and to marry the other, is too flagrant to be ju&s;tified, even in one's father.</P>
<P>Do you, my dear Mi&s;s Polly, a&s;k my opinion upon the above affair? Perhaps, I am not &s;o tender hearted, as my Polly is; but I know what I &s;hould do, was I in your circum&s;tances. Why, I &s;hould write to Mr. Danford, to meet me at &s;ome place, and then go off with him, and get married. And to u&s;e Mr. Staple|ton's words, who could call you to an account about the matter? For you know that your uncle left you &s;ome|thing of an e&s;tate, which is wholly at your di&s;po&s;al&punc; and which you may join with Mr. Danford's, and then you will be nearly as wealthy as your father.</P>
<P>But I don't &s;uppo&s;e that you will follow this advice. Well, this is what I would do. But then, you &s;aid I mu&s;t tell you how you ought to behave; and that, you know is another matter. Well, I think that par|ents ought not to do any more than advi&s;e their chil|dren; and that I think, they are in duty bound to do. But I do not think they ought to compel them to mar|ry again&s;t their wills; for in &s;uch a ca&s;e, many times, the con&s;equence is fatal. On the other hand, a parent's advice ought to be well weighed; and if it is rea&s;ona|ble, it ought be followed, by all means. But then there is &s;uch a thing as parents giving unrea&s;onable advice; and then I do not think we ought to obey them. For &s;uppo&s;e your parents &s;hould command you to murder a certain per&s;on, do you think that you ought
<PB N="21" REF="033734_0019_0FF8F0BFA884E108">
to obey them? No, by no means. Now in your af|fair&mdash;you having &s;olemnly promi&s;ed marriage to Mr. Danford; your worldly happine&s;s, in a great mea&s;|ure depending upon your fulfilling that promi&s;e: and their not advi&s;ing you to the contrary before you made that promi&s;e, when they might well expect that this would be the con&s;equence of his vi&s;its; in my mind, fully authorizes you to di&s;obey them in this point, and they have no right to command your obedience in this affair; or to make you revoke your promi&s;e</P>
<P>But I mu&s;t &s;till advi&s;e you, to u&s;e all the patience that you are capable of; for gentle methods are cer|tainly the be&s;t. And do try to gain your mother over upon your &s;ide; for that will be as likely a means to ex|tricate you out of your pre&s;ent trouble, as any that I can think of. But I would never give up the main point; nor break with Mr. Danford on any account what&s;oever. And &s;o you have my thoughts on the matter, without any re&s;erve. Pray excu&s;e what is not agreeable to your mind; and at the &s;ame time a&s;&s;ure your&s;elf, that I am your compa&s;&s;ionate friend and &s;er|vant,</P>

<HEAD>LETTER VI. From Mi&s;s <HI>POLLY GRANVILLE,</HI> to Mi&s;s SOPHIA DANIELSON.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Mi&s;s Sophia,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WILL you not be tired of reading my letters? Well, if you &s;hould be, I mu&s;t write, becau&s;e to you I can unbo&s;om all my thoughts. And, you
<PB N="22" REF="033734_0020_0FF8F0C204B5D368">
know, it is &s;ome con&s;olation for one to communicate their afflictions and trials. And then we have promi&s;|ed to write to each other every thing that is worthy of notice. Accordingly I &s;hall make no furth|er apology, but write on as u&s;ual. You mu&s;t expect to hear of nothing but trials and troubles from your Polly; and &s;o I will begin with the fir&s;t.&mdash; My mother and I have had another di&s;cour&s;e about Mr. Danford and Mr. Stapleton, which was as fol|lows:</P>
<P>My mother being in her chamber, I happened to &s;tep in at her door; &s;he &s;aid to me, Polly, come &s;it down by me, child; for I want to have &s;ome di&s;|cour&s;e with you. This put me into a flutter, as any thing &s;he &s;ays to me on that &s;ubject always does; for I was &s;en&s;ible of what &s;he wanted to talk upon. Well, I went in, and &s;at down by her, and &s;aid, what would you &s;ay to me, ma'am?</P>
<P>Why, Polly, &s;aid &s;he, you quite vexed your father by your behaviour to Mr. Stapleton. He &s;ays you did not treat him with common civility. You might have u&s;ed him with politene&s;s, though you did not in|tend to encourage him any further. You know, Pol|ly, it is the duty of a child to obey their parents; and your father commanded you to receive him kindly; therefore I think you are guilty of di&s;obedience.</P>
<P>Perhaps, ma'am, &s;aid I, you are mi&s;informed, as to my behaviour to Mr. Stapleton: for in the fir&s;t place, I a&s;&s;ure you, I treated him with all the politene&s;s I was capable of, and told him of my &s;ituation and en|gagements, but he u&s;ed me with unpolite language; and then I was obliged to be plain with him. And now, ma'am, as to obeying parents, I hold my&s;elf bound to obey my parents in all things wherein their commands are not repugnant to the commands of my Supreme Judge, as &s;et forth to us in the word of un|erring truth: where we are informed, that we ought not to be unequally yoked; which, I &s;uppo&s;e, implies this&mdash;<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> who is of a religious <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> of mind, ought not <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> be married to one that is altogether vain and abandoned &mdash;where there can be no hopes of amendment. For if a child &s;hould obey her parents
<PB N="23" REF="033734_0021_0FF8F0C76E6D1220">
in this thing, &s;he mu&s;t make her&s;elf mi&s;erable for life; and, perhaps endanger her everla&s;ting happine&s;s there|by. For if a parent has a right to command a child in &s;uch a matter, &s;urely a hu&s;band has a greater right to command his wife. And, if a child mu&s;t obey her parents in this thing, then &s;he mu&s;t be married to an abandoned man, if it is her parents' plea&s;ure. And what if that abandoned hu&s;band &s;hould command the wife to follow him in all manner of wickedne&s;s? &mdash; Why, by the &s;ame rule, &s;he mu&s;t obey him, and &s;o mu&s;t &s;in unavoidably, be&s;ides breaking the above &s;u|preme command: and therefore I think a child is not bound to obey her parents, when they command her to be joined to &s;uch a man. And now, dear ma'am, let me tell you, word for word, what pa&s;&s;ed between Mr. Stapleton and my&s;elf, that you may judge whether he or I was mo&s;t unpolite.</P>
<P>And then I related to her the whole di&s;cour&s;e, that pa&s;t between my&s;elf and Mr. Stapleton, nearly as I &s;ent it to you; and when I had ended, I made &s;ome remarks on his di&s;cour&s;e with me.</P>
<P>For him, &s;aid I, to &s;ay, that, if I really loved and e&s;teemed Mr. Danford, it was a token that I would love and re&s;pect him, would incline one to think, that he never knew what either love or friend&s;hip meant. But then his making &s;o light of &s;olemn promi&s;es, put me out of all patience with him. A wretch! to &s;ay that he had made a dozen of them already! Why do you think, Madam, that I could have any patience with him? Indeed I could not. And now, do you wi&s;h your Polly to have &s;uch a hu&s;band as this is, on who&s;e word there is no dependence; and who might divide his affection between her and another woman? If it might be &s;aid that he hath any affection. And would it not be a dreadful thing for one to have a companion, in whom they could have no confidence nor &s;ecurity: one who knows not what religion is, and hath no re|gard to right or wrong?</P>
<P>But Polly, &s;aid &s;he, perhaps you are prejudiced again&s;t him, and prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in another's favour, which might cau&s;e you to con&s;true all that he &s;aid to his di&s;|advantage;
<PB N="24" REF="033734_0022_0FF8F0CA49F61838">
and, perhaps, if you were to hear him again, he might appear to you in another point of view. And don't you wi&s;h, Polly, to have another conver&s;a|tion with him?</P>
<P>By no means, Madam, &s;aid I, if I can avoid it: nor do I de&s;ire ever to &s;ee him again. And now, dear mamma, if you have any love and affection for your Polly, you will not in&s;i&s;t upon our having another in|terview. And, if you have any regard for me, I pray you will give me your &s;entiments on his di&s;cour&s;e with me, without the lea&s;t re&s;erve; and al&s;o tell me, whether I may expect a friend in my mamma, or not.</P>
<P>At this, my mother bur&s;t into tears; and I could not avoid joining with her; and indeed, my eyes would be running over all the time I was talking with her do the be&s;t I could. Well, after a while my mother &s;aid, Polly, you know that my love and affec|tions are &s;trongly bia&s;&s;ed in your favour; and I mu&s;t acknowledge that I never did like or e&s;teem Mr. Sta|pleton, nor do I like his di&s;cour&s;e with you at all: which di&s;cover neither the gentleman nor the lover.&mdash; And I own, he was very unpolite to you, nor can I blame you much for your plainne&s;s of &s;peech to him.</P>
<P>But then, what &s;hall we do with your father? For he is ob&s;tinately bent upon your having Mr. Staple|ton; I having di&s;cour&s;ed with him on the &s;ubject, find he is not to be turned. And, he being of &s;uch a pa&s;&s;ion|ate temper, I dare not &s;peak to him any more on the &s;ubject. Therefore, you mu&s;t not let him know that I have let you into the&s;e thoughts of mine; but my heart yearned upon you &s;o, that I could not keep my mind from you any longer. And now I will a&s;&s;i&s;t you all I can; but I can have but little hopes of helping you much. Yet this will be &s;ome con&s;olation to you, that I don't hate you as you thought I did.</P>
<P>My dear Mi&s;s Sophia, after this tender declaration from her, do you think I could keep my &s;eat? No; for running to her, and dropping on my knees before her, and with my arms cla&s;ped around her, I exclaim|ed, what did you &s;ay to your Polly? And do you love me yet? When I thought I had no friend in this hou&s;e, to find that my dear mamma is yet my friend, fills
<PB N="25" REF="033734_0023_0FF8F0CE4DFAA4D0">
me with &s;uch joy, as is almo&s;t in&s;upportable! And in|deed, I cried, till I &s;obbed again; my mother joining with me. But my father coming home, I withdrew to my chamber, and could do no le&s;s than write you the whole affair. My father does not &s;o much as give me a plea&s;ant look; and is always throwing out &s;ome word or other, to let me know what to depend upon, if I don't favour Mr. Stapleton; to which I never make any an&s;wer. But I under&s;tand he intends to have another di&s;cour&s;e with me upon the above affair. And, O how I dread the interview! for I &s;hall do nothing but cry, I'll warrant: but that mu&s;t be the &s;ubject of another letter; therefore I'll conclude this, having an opportunity to &s;end it.

<P>I WILL now continue my &s;tory; for my father and I have had a di&s;cour&s;e together, on the &s;ub|ject of Mr. Stapleton, which was pretty much as follows: Being in my chamber, my father &s;ent for me to attend him in his clo&s;et; my maid attending me, I went trembling to him, and when entered&punc; &s;at down in the fir&s;t chair I came to, and thought I &s;hould have fainted, do the be&s;t I could. My father, &s;peaking to my maid&punc; &s;aid, Ann, you may withdraw, for I wi&s;h to talk with your mi&s;tre&s;s in private.</P>
<P>After Ann was gone, my father began, by &s;aying, Polly, what can be the rea&s;on, that you did not en|courage
<PB N="26" REF="033734_0024_0FF8F0D307591E68">
Mr. Stapleton, when I engaged him to vi&s;it you purely on that account? You knew it was my plea&s;ure that you &s;hould u&s;e him kindly. And now give me the rea&s;ons why you behaved &s;o unpolitely to him, when he vi&s;ited you.</P>
<P>Dear Sir, &s;aid I, I cannot di&s;cour&s;e with you on the &s;ubject. Indeed I cannot! And fell a crying.</P>
<P>But, Polly, &s;aid my father, I will be an&s;wered to the&s;e que&s;tions without the lea&s;t eva&s;ion!</P>
<P>Dear Sir, &s;aid I, I did not u&s;e him unpolitely. But as for encouraging him in the ideas of marriage with me, it is wholly inadmi&s;&s;ible; as I have not the lea&s;t po&s;&s;ible regard for him: and beg you, Sir, to excu&s;e me from ever di&s;cour&s;ing with him again on that &s;ub|ject; for I cannot think of him for a companion&mdash;in|deed I cannot!</P>
<P>Why, Polly! &s;aid my father, you would think well enough of Mr. Stapleton, were it not for Mr. Dan|ford. But I am determined that you never &s;hall &s;ee him again; and &s;o you may content your&s;elf; for that affair is at an end.</P>
<P>Well, Sir, &s;aid I, if I am never to &s;ee Mr. Dan|ford again, I am fully determined never to alter my condition. For, excu&s;e me, Sir, it is impo&s;&s;ible for me to think of another man, whil&s;t Mr. Danford is living; as I have pledged my&s;elf to him.</P>
<P>I don't care, &s;ays my father, any thing about your pledging your&s;elf to Mr. Danford; for you &s;hall not be married to him! And now, tell me, po&s;itively, whether you will encourage Mr. Stapleton or not?</P>
<P>Sir, &s;aid I, it is not fitting that I &s;hould tell my papa that I will not; therefore de&s;ire to be excu&s;ed from &s;aying any thing on the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>But, &s;aid he, you &s;hall give me a direct an&s;wer to the que&s;tion, without any equivocation.</P>
<P>Then, &s;aid I, I mu&s;t &s;ay, I cannot encourage him; and hope you will excu&s;e me, Sir, if I tell you that I think my life depends upon it; and hope you will not in&s;i&s;t upon my ever &s;eeing him again&punc; and, I am &s;ure if you love your Polly, you will not invite Mr. Sta|pleton here on that account.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="033734_0025_0FF8F0DB4E75D3F8">Polly, &s;aid he, if you are &s;o incorrigible, I &s;hall not give my&s;elf any trouble about you; and &s;o, you mu&s;t not expect any protection from me in any matter what|&s;oever; for I &s;hall wholly give you up for lo&s;t: and if you lo&s;e my friend&s;hip, I don't know what will be|come of you.</P>
<P>Dear papa, &s;aid I, will you con&s;ent for me to go to my uncle's at Philadelphia, and pay my aunt a vi&s;it; &s;he being very earne&s;t to have me vi&s;it her this &s;ea&s;on, and &s;pend the winter with her? If you will give your approbation, Sir, I will immediately &s;et about getting ready to go, as I can have an opportunity to be con|veyed there &s;oon. Dear Sir, won't you con&s;ent to my going?</P>
<P>Polly, &s;aid my father, you &s;hall not go: and from this time you &s;hall not go out of my hou&s;e; which, with the garden, &s;hall be your limits, until you &s;ubmit to my propo&s;als. I have no more to &s;ay to you at pre&s;ent, &s;o you may withdraw.</P>
<P>Well, our I went, to my chamber, and cried a good while; for the tears would run down my cheeks all the time my father was talking with me. So you &s;ee I am completely confined. Yet under all the&s;e afflic|tions, I have &s;ome con&s;olation. My Mi&s;s Sophia is my friend. Mr. Danford doth not de&s;pi&s;e me; and my mother loves me &s;till. Be&s;ides, I think I have a con|&s;cience that doth not accu&s;e me&punc; but, above all, my greate&s;t dependence is in him who is able to deliver out of all adver&s;ity; religion being my chief &s;upport. For, to contemplate &s;eriou&s;ly on heaven, and heaven|ly things, &s;eems to carry one above the noi&s;y tumults of a bu&s;y world; and fills one's &s;oul with quiet, and &s;atisfaction, in the mid&s;t of troubles and worldly afflic|tion. But, perhaps, I &s;hall conclude my letter too &s;e|riou&s;ly for your lively &s;pirits. But it being a time of trouble with me, I expect to be excu&s;ed by my Mi&s;s Sophia; who may a&s;&s;ure her&s;elf, that I am, in all conditions of life, her friend and &s;ervant,</P>

<HEAD>LETTER VIII. From Mr. <HI>DANFORD,</HI> to Mi&s;s <HI>POLLY GRANVILLE.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My Dear Mi&s;s Polly,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I CAN take no re&s;t or comfort becau&s;e of your confinement. Mu&s;t I be the cau&s;e of &s;o much trouble and affliction, to the per&s;on in whom my worldy happine&s;s is wholly centered? But, my dear, if it was in my power to extricate you out of the&s;e difficulties, I &s;hould not he&s;itate one moment: but I don't &s;ee that any thing can be done at pre&s;ent, in an honorable way, to deliver you out of your trouble. I find I am whol|ly excluded from &s;eeing you: for, applying to Mr. Granville for leave to di&s;cour&s;e with you for the &s;pace of ten minutes only, I was denied with contempt. I even expo&s;tulated with him, to &s;uffer me to take my leave of you, if no more, but could not prevail. I then told him how deeply I was intere&s;ted in your welfare; which only put him into a pa&s;&s;ion; and I was forced to drop the &s;ubject: But it touched me to the quick, to think that I mu&s;t not &s;o much as di&s;|cour&s;e with him upon the matter. For he forbid me ever &s;aying any thing about you again. But I don't love you the le&s;s for his behaviour to me, no, my dear. You may re&s;t a&s;&s;ured, that I am wholly your's, and that my affections are unalterably fixed, and are uncapable of roving. But I am going to propo&s;e a thing to you, which is this. The &s;hip Good&s;peed now lies at the wharf, ready loaded for the Ea&s;t, and perhaps will pro|ceed as far as Canton, in China: which will be a voyage of a year and a half or two years; and as I own one half of her, the re&s;t of the owners have ap|plied to me to go in her, in the capacity of a &s;uper-cargo. I having &s;ome inclination to vi&s;it tho&s;e coun|tries; and my affairs being now in a pro&s;perous &s;itua|tion,
<PB N="29" REF="033734_0027_0FF8F0EA541B1458">
I think it may be productive of good to us, for me to undertake the voyage. If Providence &s;hould &s;till &s;mile upon me, perhaps, in the cour&s;e of a year or two, I may appear in a le&s;s exceptionable point of view to your father than I do at pre&s;ent I think, at lea&s;t, my going abroad, mu&s;t effect your liberation. I cannot think of your being confined wholly on my account; and I di&s;dain to u&s;e any kind of artifice, to get you into my hands, until every other method is tried: for we ought not to u&s;e fraud in any ca&s;e what&s;oever, but tru&s;t all our affairs in the hands of a kind Providence; and, be a&s;&s;ured, my dear, if we do, we &s;hall not be di&s;appointed. And I verily believe, that we &s;hall be extricated out of the&s;e troubles and difficulties, and be happier in each other than if tho&s;e difficulties had never befallen us. Some things that have come under my ob&s;ervation of late, fully evinces the above ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not, however, engage in this undertaking without your approbation; and &s;hall therefore wait your an&s;wer to this before I proceed any farther. For it &s;hall be wholly in your power to command me, either to go or &s;tay, as you &s;hall think mo&s;t conducive to your happine&s;s. At the &s;ame time, you may re&s;t a&s;&s;ured, that I am wholly your's; and &s;hall remain &s;o, either at home or abroad.</P>
<P>And now, my deare&s;t Mi&s;s Polly, let us put our whole tru&s;t in that Providence which is able to keep us in all the&s;e changes and vici&s;&s;itudes of life, and bring good out of evil&mdash;which I pray may be the happy ca&s;e with you and me. And I cannot but make &s;ome de|pendence on being happy in you, after the&s;e &s;torms are overblown.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER IX. From Mi&s;s <HI>POLLY GRANVILLE,</HI> to Mr. DANFORD.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My Deare&s;t Friend,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I RECEIVED your letter with as true af|fection, perhaps, as you wrote it; but language will fail me to de&s;cribe the gratitude of my heart, for your regard and tenderne&s;s to me, after your having expe|rienced &s;uch in&s;ulting behaviour and outrageous lan|guage from my father. But there is no compari&s;on between virtue and vice: for virtue will ever &s;et a man above re&s;entment at the little foibles of tho&s;e that have no regard to virtue; cau&s;ing him to act con&s;i&s;tent|ly in every occurrence of life; not even aiming to take the advantage of the low minded; but pa&s;&s;ing on in qui|et, through the boi&s;terous tumults of a noi&s;y world, with a mind fully fixed, and firmly re&s;ted, on a kind Provi|dence; he is willing to wait the determination of that Providence; and not to ru&s;h into fraudulent mea&s;ures to extricate him&s;elf out of difficulty. This is the cha|racteri&s;tic of my dear Mr. Danford, when, at the &s;ame time, tho&s;e, that are not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of your noble mind, would try to retaliate and u&s;e every kind of fraud, to be revenged on &s;uch as they think are their ene|mies; by which means they often involve them&s;elves in inextricable difficulties, which often end in their ut|ter ruin.</P>
<P>But to return: I think you have pitched upon a noble mode of conduct, which cannot fail of &s;alutary effects. It will, doubtle&s;s, be productive of my enlarge|ment. And, in the time of your ab&s;ence, &s;omething, I doubt not, will turn up to our advantage in an honor|able way, which will be va&s;tly preferable to the &s;ame end gained in a clande&s;tine manner. For, to u&s;e your language, I don't think fraud ought to be u&s;ed in any
<PB N="31" REF="033734_0029_0FF8F0F2779A44A8">
ca&s;e what&s;oever. If we tru&s;t to Providence, I don't think we &s;hall be di&s;appointed.</P>
<P>I fully acquie&s;ce in your propo&s;al of vi&s;iting the ea&s;tern part of the world. And may your life and health be pre&s;erved, and the be&s;t of heaven's ble&s;&s;ings attend you, until you return, richly experiencing the kind hand of Providence. In the mean time, I expe|rience great trials, and afflictions on your account: for my father, u&s;ing me with great &s;everity, has confined me to the hou&s;e; except that I have the privilege of the garden, with my maid to attend me as u&s;ual. But his &s;everity has only this effect, to increa&s;e my affec|tions to you: cau&s;ing me to &s;ee the va&s;t di&s;parity be|tween a virtuous character, and a man who&s;e aims are wholly confined to this world. But I mu&s;t tell you that I have gained my mother over on my &s;ide, who no doubt will try all in her power to help me.</P>
<P>I &s;till expect to &s;uffer great trials; but am determin|ed to adhere firmly to the promi&s;e I made you. And you may re&s;t a&s;&s;ured, that I will prove con&s;tant to you even to a punctilio. Neither &s;hall any trouble that I may meet with le&s;&s;en my attachment to you. I have re|que&s;ted of my father to allow me to go to my uncle's at Philadelphia, and was denied. But I &s;hall renew my reque&s;t when you are gone, and perhaps by the inter|ference of my mother, I may gain his con&s;ent. But I hope I &s;hall conduct my&s;elf in all the&s;e affairs, &s;o as that I may be blamele&s;s, and have a con&s;cience void of offence; ever tru&s;ting and looking to him for aid, who is able to re&s;cue in the greate&s;t di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>And &s;o I conclude with my warme&s;t and mo&s;t unfeigned wi&s;hes, and prayers, that you may be re|turned in &s;afety to your friend and humble &s;ervant,</P>

<HEAD>LETTER X. From Mi&s;s <HI>POLLY GRANVILLE,</HI> to Mi&s;s SOPHIA DANIELSON.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Mi&s;s Sophia,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT has been &s;ome time &s;ince I wrote to you; and longer &s;ince I received a line from you. I have a great many things to tell you; for you &s;ay you wi&s;h to be informed of all the occurrences relative to Mr. Danford. Accordingly, I &s;hall proceed without any apology. And, in the fir&s;t place, I will inform you that Mr. Danford &s;ent me a letter, informing me of his de&s;ign of going in the &s;hip Good&s;peed, to the Ea&s;t Indies, if agreeable to me. To which I returned an an&s;wer, that I had no objection. And now he is gone, having &s;ailed about a fortnight ago; &s;ince which, I have had the old &s;tory over again; my father having had another di&s;cour&s;e with me, in which he told me, that Mr. Danford was now gone to a far di&s;tant country, (which plainly &s;hewed, as was always his opinion, that he did not &s;et much by me, notwith&s;tanding all his pro|fe&s;&s;ions of e&s;teem;) as he is now gone, &s;aid he, the mat|ter is at an end. For now he hath plainly &s;howed what he was after, that he wanted the lamb for the &s;ake of her fleece. For, when he &s;aw that he was not likely to have any of my e&s;tate, his love &s;oon came to nothing; and now he has run away. Well, Polly, I can &s;oon make up your lo&s;s, for I have invited Mr. Stapleton to pay you another vi&s;it, and I hope now he will have better &s;ucce&s;s, &s;ince your idol hath for&s;aken you. And I hope you will receive him in a more polite manner than you did when he was here before; at lea&s;t, I hope you will receive him with common civility. And what &s;ay you, Polly, to another vi&s;it from Mr. Staple|ton?</P>
<P>Dear Sir, &s;aid I, if I tell you, that I cannot re|ceive his vi&s;its, you will be angry with me. But if I
<PB N="33" REF="033734_0031_0FF8F0F997B1FAA0">
mu&s;t an&s;wer you directly to your que&s;tion, I mu&s;t &s;ay, that I don't de&s;ire to &s;ee him on any &s;uch account. And if he gives him&s;elf the trouble of calling upon me, I cannot di&s;cour&s;e with him upon the &s;ubject you mentioned. Therefore I beg to be excu&s;ed from &s;ee|ing him at all, for it is impo&s;&s;ible for me to think of placing him in any other relation to me, than he now &s;tands in.</P>
<P>Polly, &s;aid my father, you are of an incorrigible temper, and take more delight in di&s;plea&s;ing me than any thing you do. If Mr. Stapleton was ever &s;o agreea|ble to you, yet, I believe you would reject him mere|ly to di&s;plea&s;e me.</P>
<P>Sir, &s;aid I, I &s;hould be happy in plea&s;ing my papa, if it was in my power. But as for encouraging Mr. Stapleton, I cannot: for my worldly happine&s;s doth wholly depend upon my not being connected with him. And do you, Sir, wi&s;h to make me wretched for life? I cannot think you do&mdash;but, dear Sir, let me be excu&s;ed from &s;eeing Mr. Stapleton, dear Sir, do!</P>
<P>At this, my father broke out into a violent rage, and &s;aid, that if I did not receive him kindly, he would turn me out of his hou&s;e and di&s;inherit me; and nev|er regard me again, any more than he would a &s;tran|ger. He then charged me to mind how I behaved my&s;elf, for he would not, he &s;aid, bear &s;uch treatment from me in future.&mdash;And &s;o he di&s;mi&s;&s;ed me.</P>
<P>I went to my chamber, and &s;pent the remainder of the day and evening in lamenting my great afflic|tion, and then wrote thus far, and &s;hall &s;till continue, writing, until I have an opportunity to &s;end you what I have written.</P>
<P>My dear Mi&s;s Sophia, I will now proceed with my narrative, and relate our further proceedings; for I have had another di&s;cour&s;e with my mother, and thus it began. As my mother and I were &s;itting togeth|er, &s;he bid the maid go down and &s;tay till &s;he &s;hould ring for her. She then &s;aid to me, Polly, your fath|er is much &s;et upon your receiving another vi&s;it from Mr. Stapleton; and perhaps, as Mr. Danford has now
<PB N="34" REF="033734_0032_0FF8F0FBF3177F90">
left the country, you will think more favourable of Mr. Stapleton than you did before. It being uncer|tain that Mr. Danford will ever come near you again. For it appears to me that he would never have under|taken &s;uch a voyage, had he &s;et as high a value upon you as he pretended: for he might well think you would be married to &s;ome other man in his ab|&s;ence. And indeed I cannot find that he ever &s;aid a word to you about his going &s;o long a voyage: nor that he has ever &s;ent you a letter &s;ince your father for|bid him our hou&s;e. If that is the ca&s;e, it is very prob|able he has done thinking of you in any other view, than that of a common acquaintance.</P>
<P>Dear ma'am, &s;aid I, I cannot think of Mr. Staple|ton; and I wi&s;h I might not be under the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;eeing him again. But I don't &s;ee how I can avoid it: and yet you told me that you would &s;tand my friend; and do, dear mamma, &s;tand by me&mdash;for I cannot think of having any body but Mr. Danford.</P>
<P>Well, Polly, &s;aid &s;he, has Mr. Danford &s;ent you any letters of late? Upon my acknowledging that he had, &s;he de&s;ired me to let her &s;ee them; and upon her promi&s;ing the utmo&s;t &s;ecre&s;y, I con&s;ented; and immediately fetched her two letters that I received from Mr Danford, and copies of the two letters that I &s;ent him, and gave them into her hand. She read them, and gave them to me again &mdash; &s;aying, well, Polly, I &s;ee now, that the matter is &s;ettled between Mr. Danford and you: and it will be in vain for Mr. Stapleton to renew his vi&s;its to you. But I think it will be be&s;t for you to u&s;e him with politene&s;s, on your father's account; for I dread the con&s;equence if you &s;hould not&mdash;as your father's heart &s;eems to be bound up in Mr. Stapleton; and if you finally reject him, I fear he will turn you off entirely, and wholly di&s;inherit you.</P>
<P>Dear Madam, &s;aid I, as for his di&s;inheriting me, it does not trouble me much&mdash;for great riches have not the charms with me that they have with &s;ome.&mdash; My heart is not wholly &s;et on the things of this world. As to an e&s;tate, you know, ma'am, that Mr. Dan|ford
<PB N="35" REF="033734_0033_0FF8BF84C7413550">
is in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a good e&s;tate, and the intere&s;t that my uncle left me, is &s;omething con&s;iderable&mdash; which, placed together, will make a fortune, fully an|&s;wering the utmo&s;t of my wi&s;hes. But then I dread my father's di&s;plea&s;ure; and I would do any thing to gain his ble&s;&s;ing, con&s;i&s;tent with my former &s;olemn promi&s;es: for a parent's ble&s;&s;ing is an e&s;&s;ential thing with me&mdash;I prize that above all my father's e&s;tate. You don't know, Madam, how many tears it has co&s;t me already; for I do nothing but cry night and day.&mdash; But it gives me great con&s;olation, to think you are my friend, becau&s;e, now I can unbo&s;om my mind to you, which is a great relief to me.</P>
<P>As for my being favourable to Mr. Stapleton, I cannot in any &s;en&s;e of the word: for if I &s;hould, and then reject him, it would only exa&s;perate my father the more. And &s;o I think it will be be&s;t to u&s;e him plainly: for if there mu&s;t be a &s;torm with my father, it may as well be now, as &s;ix months hence. But if matters &s;hould be de&s;perate with my father, do be &s;o kind, as to intercede with him to let me go and pay my uncle Finter, of Philadelphia, a vi&s;it: my aunt Finter having &s;ent me a letter, de&s;iring me to wait on her this &s;ea&s;on and &s;pend the winter there. Now, Madam, if you could prevail with my father, to give his con&s;ent for me to go; and if I &s;hould &s;tay there &s;ome time, perhaps, &s;omething might turn up that would reconcile my father to me. At lea&s;t it would have this effect, that I &s;hould be out of the way of Mr. Stapleton; and then he would &s;oon addre&s;s &s;ome other per&s;on; for one is as good as another, with him. As he is void of any kind of love, or tender feelings, per&s;on|al qualifications are not an object with him. Doubt|le&s;s, he would be glad of money; for his mind is whol|ly &s;et on the world. If he &s;hould marry &s;ome other per&s;on, it would relieve me of that trouble; and, per|haps, &s;omething would turn up, that I might gain my father's affections, and ble&s;&s;ing; which would be a happy event to me. And now, Madam, mayn't I de|pend on your aid in this matter? May I not?</P>
<P>Polly, &s;aid &s;he, I will think on this matter, and per|haps
<PB N="36" REF="033734_0034_0FF8F10361BD5440">
I may a&s;&s;i&s;t you; for I think it be&s;t for you to go to your uncle's, and &s;pend the winter there. And after this vi&s;it of Mr. Stapleton is over, I will impor|tune your father on your behalf. But you mu&s;t keep the&s;e things to your&s;elf, on my account. For &s;hould your father know of this di&s;cour&s;e, he would be di&s;|plea&s;ed at me, as well as at you.</P>
<P>Upon this, I went out; and now you &s;ee that I mu&s;t have another interview with Mr. Stapleton. And O, how I dread that interview! But I am re|&s;olved to u&s;e him very plainly. Don't you think 'twill be the be&s;t way? Well, that mu&s;t be the &s;ubject of another letter; in the mean time, a&s;&s;ure your&s;elf that I am, &amp;c.</P>

<P>I WILL now continue my narrative, with|out much regard to method, as I am writing to my Mi&s;s Sophia, who will make proper allowances.</P>
<P>Well, Mr. Stapleton has paid me another vi&s;it; and the creature came in full a&s;&s;urance of &s;ucce&s;s; being filled with a &s;en&s;e of his own importance. Indeed, he is, naturally, very &s;elf-&s;ufficient. Well, I thought I would u&s;e him with a little plea&s;antry, to &s;ee if I could not &s;hame him; and, at the &s;ame time, divert my &s;elf.

And he, &s;eating him|&s;elf by me, &s;aid, well, Mi&s;s Polly, I am come to pay you another vi&s;it; and I hope it will be more agree|able to you now, than when I called upon you the oth|er day. What &s;ay you?</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="033734_0035_0FF8F105AF0D8C28">Perhaps, Mr. Stapleton, &s;aid I, you and I may be|come acquainted yet, in &s;pite of my be&s;t endeavours to the contrary. For you are &s;o good, Sir, as to pay your re&s;pects officiou&s;ly. But I wi&s;h to know on what errand you have come; and then I &s;hall know how to di&s;cour&s;e with you.</P>
<P>I have come, &s;aid he, upon the old &s;core of court|&s;hip; and hope now, you will not &s;ay to me, nay: &s;ee|ing Mr. Danford is gone; that being your chief ob|jection before. And I expected to have been received now with open arms; and that you would have been more earne&s;tly engaged in the bu&s;ine&s;s, than I &s;hould my&s;elf.</P>
<P>It is a wonder, Sir, &s;aid I, that I have not been to your hou&s;e, before now, on this &s;ame bu&s;ine&s;s; but I beg you to excu&s;e me, Sir, becau&s;e it is not agreeable to the rules of decorum, for a maiden to addre&s;s a man on that &s;ubject. But I mu&s;t tell you, Sir, that I &s;hould think much better of you, if you could di&s;tingui&s;h be|tween real affection, and real hatred. But I find you are void of quick di&s;cernment, or el&s;e you are wilful|ly blinded, and won't di&s;cern.</P>
<P>Be that as it may, &s;aid he, I will not give up my preten&s;ions to you; as your father promi&s;es to aid me all in his power. Nay, I will even worry you with my vi&s;its, and perhaps, by and bye, you will think more favorably of me. And &s;o I do not de&s;pair of &s;ucce&s;s yet.</P>
<P>Well Sir, &s;aid I, I am already greatly <HI>worried</HI> with your vi&s;its; and yet you may well de&s;pair of &s;ucce&s;s: for I declare po&s;itively, that you &s;hall never &s;ucceed with me. And if you had the lea&s;t di&s;cernment, you would not have given your&s;elf the trouble to call up|on me, at this time. And, indeed, had you the lea&s;t &s;en&s;e of honor, you would, now, quit all your preten&s;ions; and try to gain me my father's affection, that you have been the means of alienating from me. Had you a generous heart, you would try to extricate me out of the difficulty you have brought me into. But I can't depend upon your genero&s;ity: fearing that you are wholly de&s;titute of that noblene&s;s of mind. But you being an egoti&s;t, and &s;elf-admirer, are led to think it
<PB N="38" REF="033734_0036_0FF8F108841C2F60">
impo&s;&s;ible but that every one mu&s;t like you: And it is of no avail to u&s;e rea&s;on with you; becau&s;e you are not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, in any con&s;iderable degree of that noble qualification, which rai&s;eth the humane above the bru|tal creation. Perhaps, Sir, I &s;hall rai&s;e your choler; and I don't care if I do: becau&s;e you de&s;erve to be dealt plainly with, at lea&s;t, from me. For you have been the cau&s;e of great trouble and affliction to me. And now, Sir, why won't you be &s;o kind, as to quit all thoughts of me, and let me try to extricate my&s;elf out of tho&s;e entanglements, as well as I can? For 'twill be fruitle&s;s, to &s;ay any thing more to me on that &s;ubject; as I am fully determined in my own mind; and unaltera|bly &s;et again&s;t any alliance with you, of &s;uch a nature. And, dear Sir, if you will give me no more trouble on this &s;core, I &s;hall ever e&s;teem you as my father's friend, and my benefactor.</P>
<P>But, &s;aid he, perhaps I &s;hall get your father's di&s;|plea&s;ure, if I don't per&s;i&s;t. Indeed, I am almo&s;t di&s;|couraged: and if it was not for your father, I would relinqui&s;h all preten&s;ions to you; but I don't know how he will like it, if I &s;hould. Dear Sir, &s;aid I, my father will not re&s;ent the matter with you; but I &s;hall feel the weight of his re&s;entment. Then, Sir, you will leave me, won't you? What &s;ay you to this?</P>
<P>I will not, &s;aid he, in&s;i&s;t any more upon it at pre&s;|ent; and &s;o I hope you will think as favourable of me as you can. So taking his leave of me, he went out, and told my father, that he found me wholly aver&s;e to any alliance with him; and thought it be&s;t to drop the matter; thanked my father for his favour|able opinion of him, took his leave of him, and with|drew.</P>
<P>I have not &s;een my father &s;ince, but I fear his di&s;|plea&s;ure greatly. Dear Mi&s;s Sophia, the&s;e are trying &s;cenes; for 'tis hard to di&s;obey parents; but in this thing, I cannot obey my father. Yet I would not wilfully do a wrong thing for the world! And, O that I may &s;o behave my&s;elf, as that I may, in &s;ome mea&s;|ure, be blamele&s;s! But, Mi&s;s Sophia, one word to you. I have heard that Mr. Granbe has paid his ad|dre&s;&s;es

<P>Well now, Mi&s;s Sophia, I &s;hall expect a letter from you; for you have a good &s;ubject now to write upon, and I want &s;ome of your advice. At the &s;ame time, you may a&s;&s;ure your&s;elf, that</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XII. From Mi&s;s <HI>SOPHIA DANIELSON,</HI> to Mi&s;s POLLY GRANVILLE.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My dear Mi&s;s Polly,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE read your letters with emotion, and I feel for you in every line. Your trials are truly complicated; having an angry father at home, who ought to give you protection, and endeavour to &s;ecure your morals: but who, on the contrary, is turned again&s;t you, and is trying to de&s;troy them. And abroad, the man in whom you placed your whole de|light, is abandoning his country on your account.</P>
<P>Well, now let us look on the bright &s;ide. I am ex|ceeding glad that you have gained your mother over; and as you are rid of Mr. Stapleton, it is not likely you will meet with any more trouble from that quarter; upon which event I do heartily congratulate you.</P>
<P>Your propo&s;ition of going to your uncle's at Phila|delphia, I think, is a good thought of your's; for if you can once get there, perhaps you can ea&s;ily gain liberty to continue there till Mr. Danford returns; and I doubt not, but, by the help of your mother, you
<PB N="40" REF="033734_0038_0FF8F10AB7B20A98">
will gain your father's con&s;ent to your going. I know you ever had a de&s;ire to vi&s;it your aunt, and this will be a lucky opportunity, as you will &s;pring two mines at once; you will get clear of the&s;e dome&s;tic di&s;quie|tudes, and pay your aunt, and cou&s;ins, a vi&s;it at the &s;ame time.</P>
<P>Well, as to what you wrote about my own affairs, do you think I will acquaint you with my love affairs; and let you into tho&s;e tran&s;actions, which delicacy and prudence, in our &s;ex, require us to conceal? Yes, to my Mi&s;s Polly, I will write, without any kind of re|&s;erve.</P>
<P>Well, the affair was introduced in the following manner. One day, as I &s;at in the &s;ummer-hou&s;e, at the end of our garden, I &s;aw my father enter the gar|den, with Mr. Granbe. They walked the garden, and &s;eemed to be engaged in di&s;cour&s;e. After taking &s;everal winding-walks, but &s;till bending their cour&s;e towards the &s;ummer-hou&s;e, at length they came to the door. I aro&s;e, paid my re&s;pects, and was going to withdraw; but my father &s;aid to me, Sophia, this gentlemen wi&s;hes to have &s;ome di&s;cour&s;e with you for a few minutes; and then he immediately with|drew. We &s;eated our&s;elves in the &s;ummer-hou&s;e, and di&s;cour&s;ed together for &s;ome time; &s;ince which he has renewed his vi&s;its often. He is a gentleman of a noble mind and generous heart; is very polite, and &s;eems to have a tender regard for me: he is of a &s;erious turn of mind; and, I think, one may fully tru&s;t to his honour. But the mo&s;t fortunate circum&s;tance is, that he is a favourite of my father's. Now, what objection can I have to &s;uch a man? Or what objections have you to &s;uch an alliance for your Sophia? Will you &s;end me your thoughts on the &s;ubject, and at the &s;ame time continue your narrative? For I mu&s;t know all your proceedings; and &s;o you mu&s;t write without any re&s;erve. And at the &s;ame time, you may look upon me as your mo&s;t faithful friend and &s;ervant,</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XIII. From Mi&s;s <HI>POLLY GRANVILLE,</HI> to Mi&s;s SOPHIA DANIELSON.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My dear Mi&s;s Sophia,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS it has been &s;ome time &s;ince I wrote to you, I have &s;everal things to inform you of: for I have met with more hard things, and experienced more of my father's di&s;plea&s;ure. But now I am all joyous; and &s;o you &s;ee I go from one extreme to the other. But to continue my narrative.&mdash;My father and I have had another ecclairci&s;&s;ement: for he called upon me to explain to him, the rea&s;ons of my conduct of late, and &s;aid he would have an an&s;wer to his que&s;tion, without the lea&s;t eva&s;ion.</P>
<P>Sir, &s;aid I, what part of my conduct would you wi&s;h me to explain to you?</P>
<P>I will have you explain to me, &s;aid he, the rea&s;ons why you di&s;obeyed me, in not encouraging Mr. Sta|pleton.</P>
<P>There are many rea&s;ons, Sir, &s;aid I, which I can give, why I could not encourage him. In the fir&s;t place, he is a man that I could never love or e&s;teem; and then his morals are altogether naughty: for he cares not for right or wrong. He is not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of that turn of mind that would be in any degree agreea|ble to me&mdash;for he &s;eems to me to be formed for a ty|rant. Why, he once told me, that he &s;hould fir&s;t take care to gain my obedience, and then look out for my love and e&s;teem. Now, Sir, that plainly &s;hows that he means to make a &s;lave of his wife. And would you wi&s;h, Sir, that your daughter &s;hould live in a &s;tate of va&s;&s;alage all her days, and be in a wor&s;e condition than the meane&s;t of your dependants? And, indeed Sir, I &s;hould rather be a &s;ervant in &s;ome families, than to be his wife. And I hope, Sir, you will forgive my &s;eeming di&s;obedience, now you have heard my inducements to reject him.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="033734_0040_0FF8F10F767D10F0">But he is very rich, &s;aid my father, and you know money an&s;wers all things; and why need you care about his morals, as long as he has money enough? His morals won't effect you&mdash;you may look to your own rectitude, and let his alone. A large e&s;tate is all that you ought to look after, when going to be mar|ried.</P>
<P>Dear Sir, &s;aid I, I mu&s;t differ from you in &s;enti|ment relative to the choice of a companion. Are not virtue and noblene&s;s of mind, va&s;tly preferable to rich|es and grandeur? For riches may be &s;uddenly taken from a man, and then if he has nothing el&s;e to recom|mend him, he will be in a poor condition indeed. A per&s;on of no morals is not to be tru&s;ted, but a virtuous per&s;on will be tru&s;ted and re&s;pected in whatever &s;ta|tion of life he may be in. As to a man's bad morals not effecting his wife, I cannot join with you, Sir: for a man's word is his wife's &s;ecurity: but where one cannot tru&s;t to her hu&s;band's honour, how can &s;he feel her&s;elf &s;afe? And then, &s;uch an one will bring di&s;grace upon him&s;elf; and how can the man be di&s;graced without his companion participating in it? For that connection, let me remind you, dear Sir, is, or ought to be, very near.</P>
<P>On the other hand, a virtuous man is ever the hon|our, and glory of his wife. Such a man will ever come into one's pre&s;ence with that &s;erenity and cheerful|ne&s;s in his countenance, which is a true emblem of greatne&s;s of mind. And indeed, &s;uch men, and &s;uch only, are capable of that tenderne&s;s, love, and great|ne&s;s of &s;oul, that would ever cau&s;e me to delight in the other &s;ex. And now, Sir, I hope I have an&s;wer|ed your demand, as to this &s;ubject.</P>
<P>Well, Polly, &s;aid he, you have di&s;obliged me to that degree, that for the future, I &s;hall not give my|&s;elf any trouble about you; and you mu&s;t not expect ever to &s;hare in my affections or e&s;tate, as you would if you had not di&s;obeyed me.</P>
<P>Dear papa, &s;aid I, if I may expect to have your ble&s;&s;ing, I will be content, as I &s;hall prize that above any thing. And may not I expect&punc; Sir, to have your
<PB N="43" REF="033734_0041_0FF8BF8E21C7E360">
con&s;ent to my &s;pending the winter with my aunt Fin|ter, at Philadelphia? Do, dear Sir, give me your con&s;ent to go, will you? I had rather you would go than not, &s;aid he, and you may &s;tay there, until you come home more obedient to your father, than you are at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>I thank you, Sir, &s;aid I, and it &s;hall ever be my &s;tudy to plea&s;e my papa in all things that I po&s;&s;ibly can: for there is nobody that has a greater affection for a father than I have, or would do more for a par|ent than I would. And &s;o I withdrew. But it was a hard ta&s;k to me, to talk &s;o much to my father on that &s;ubject: for I am ever &s;truck with an awe, when I come into his pre&s;ence, as he has a very &s;tern ma|je&s;tic countenance, and &s;eems to look one through. Well, I am now preparing for my vi&s;it, and &s;hall &s;et out in le&s;s than a month. I am determined to go in the &s;tage-coach, being quite aver&s;e to water carriage. And now you may &s;ee I am all life, having gained my point farther than I expected. And who knows but I &s;hall gain a complete deliverance after a while. It is be&s;t, I &s;ee, not to run our&s;elves into ruin, but wait upon the movements of Providence, and tru&s;t our|&s;elves wholly to a divine care, which I hope to do in &s;ome mea&s;ure. And I will yet venture my&s;elf in the hands of that Divine Power, who cannot do ami&s;s.</P>
<P>Well, now, as to your affairs with Mr. Granbe. Why, your court&s;hip goes on &s;wimmingly; and I &s;uppo&s;e you have nearly arrived at the haven of matri|mony. Well, look out, if you &s;hould arrive there before I do. Do you a&s;k for my objections to Mr. Granbe? I have no objections; but, on the contrary, I think he is a gentleman, in the genuine &s;en&s;e of the word; and that you cannot do better than to receive his vi&s;its. And be&s;ides, it &s;eems your family are all delighted with him. And your father is a man of quick di&s;cernment, and is a good judge of men, and their preten&s;ions.</P>

<P>I AM greatly rejoiced to find you have gain|ed your father's con&s;ent to vi&s;it your aunt Finter. I am inclined to think, that your &s;ufferings on that &s;core are nearly at an end; for certainly, when Mr. Dan|ford arrives at Philadelphia, and finds you there, he will, doubtle&s;s, marry you without waiting for your father's con&s;ent. And I don't &s;ee where the wrong will be, as he will find you out of your father's pro|tection. And as your father has threatened to di&s;in|herit you, it will make no difference whether you plea&s;e him, or not. If I was in your place, I &s;hould be glad of &s;uch an opportunity to &s;teal a march upon them. Indeed, I could not help exulting a little, upon fru&s;trating their views, though they were my parents. But I don't know whether it would be right or not. Perhaps you will &s;end me your thoughts on the &s;ub|ject in your next letter: for I expect to receive letters from you, even from Philadelphia. And you mu&s;t write all the occurrences relative to your court&s;hip, until you are married. And I &s;hall expect one letter from you &s;oon after you arrive there.</P>
<P>Well, as to my own affairs. You &s;eem to threaten me if I &s;hould get married before you; but you don't &s;ay what &s;hall be the puni&s;hment. And therefore, 'tis ten to one if I don't; for matters go on in as ju&s;t a train as can be expected. Mr. Granbe continues his vi&s;its, and I expect that we &s;hall &s;oon &s;tand in a differ|ent capacity to each other, than what we do at pre&s;|ent. Well, when this event takes place, I will write and inform you of it. And &s;o I conclude, wi&s;hing you peace and pro&s;perity, and every enjoyment that life can afford.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XV. From Mi&s;s <HI>POLLY GRANVILLE,</HI> to Mi&s;s SOPHIA DANIELSON.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My dear Mi&s;s Sophia,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM now &s;afely arrived at my uncle Finter's hou&s;e in Philadelphia. My uncle Finter is a very noble minded man indeed. He is an ornament to the age he lives in; being, be&s;ides, otherwi&s;e qualified, quite a religious man. He has a large e&s;tate, and car|ries on an exten&s;ive trade; and, of cour&s;e, has a large family; yet not one of his family is allowed to be ab|&s;ent at the time of prayers, which are con&s;tantly per|formed by him&s;elf every night and morning. And all under his care are enjoined to attend con&s;tantly on public wor&s;hip, on the Lord's day; except they have &s;uch an excu&s;e as they dare appear before their Judge with, at the la&s;t day. And all are commanded to let their conver&s;ation be mode&s;t&punc; and to live, as if they expected to give an account of their behaviour and conduct in life. After I have told you this, you may expect that they have a very mode&s;t, regular family. And, indeed, I never lived in &s;uch a delightful family before. For you know that religion always appeared beautiful to me. And how different is this family from many in the world! And even from my father's! For he being a lover of the world, gave him&s;elf no trouble about religious duties; in which I always thought he was faulty. But it is my earne&s;t prayer that he may &s;ee his mi&s;take, and reform, before it is too late. 'Tis my opinion, that if a man did not think well of relig|ion, yet he would find his account in &s;etting up &s;uch a regulation in his family; if it were only for the &s;ake of the government of his hou&s;e. But my uncle is quite a thoughtful man; and takes delight in the perform|ance of his duty, which &s;eems to impre&s;s one's mind
<PB N="46" REF="033734_0044_0FF8BF93668F0860">
with holy thoughts, that carry one quite out of them|&s;elves, and give one the foreta&s;te of tho&s;e delights that are re&s;erved for them, who love virtue, and are willing to &s;uffer for religion. My uncle and aunt have been made acquainted with my &s;tory; are very kind to me, and try to make me as ea&s;y as po&s;&s;ible. And, as I am of a &s;ober turn of mind, my uncle takes delight in di&s;|cour&s;ing with me; and often tells me, that I &s;hall not go home again, until Mr. Danford returns He tells me he has &s;een Mr. Danford, and was delighted with him at their fir&s;t acquaintance. If Mr. Danford, &s;aid my uncle, was not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of one copper of e&s;tate&punc; I &s;hould prefer him in every re&s;pect, to any rich, &s;elfi&s;h clown whatever. But I am informed, &s;aid he, that his circum&s;tances are quite ea&s;y; and you mu&s;t make your&s;elf ea&s;y with us, Polly, till Mr. Danford returns, who will touch in here, as the &s;hip is partly to unload in this port; and we will write to your father, not doubting but his con&s;ent can be obtained to your mar|riage. In the mean time, you mu&s;t make your&s;elf as ea&s;y, and as free, as if you were in your father's hou&s;e. And furthermore, child, &s;aid he, I de&s;ire you would look upon me as a father, until your other father is re|conciled to you; which event, I have no doubt, will he brought about in a happy manner. In the mean time, I &s;hall look upon you as one of my daughters. And you mu&s;t not harbour a thought of being burden|&s;ome to us; for we delight to have you in the family, and &s;hall regret your departure, whenever the time comes that we mu&s;t be deprived of you. And &s;o you &s;ee, Mi&s;s Sophia, that I may make my&s;elf ea&s;y; and indeed I &s;hould, if I had but my father's ble&s;&s;ing. But what do you think I could &s;ay to my uncle? Why I could do nothing but cry for joy, I think, which my uncle &s;aw with plea&s;ure: for he is a man of di&s;|cernment, and can di&s;tingui&s;h between tears of joy, and tho&s;e of a troubled heart. But I recovered my|&s;elf as well as I could, and thanked him for his kind|ne&s;s to, and tenderne&s;s of me. But my heart &s;eemed as if it would have left its orbit, on &s;uch a tender di&s;|cour&s;e as this was. For having had nothing but rough
<PB N="47" REF="033734_0045_0FF8F11E59EA4AE8">
u&s;age of late, and now having all the&s;e tender ex|pre&s;&s;ions heaped on me; indeed it was almo&s;t too much for me. But my uncle and aunt often di&s;cour&s;e on the&s;e &s;ubjects, and &s;ometimes on religion; and in|deed they try all in their power to make my pre&s;ent &s;ituation agreeable to me.</P>
<P>I will now give you &s;ome account of my cou&s;ins. My uncle has four children, three daughters and a lit|tle &s;on. The olde&s;t daughter is about fourteen; nam|ed Sally, after my aunt. She is a &s;weet girl, and I take great delight in her company; and indeed we are almo&s;t always together. And it &s;eems to plea&s;e my uncle much, that I &s;et &s;o much by her; for he is very fond of his children; and well enough he may be, they being very promi&s;ing, and mode&s;t behaved.</P>
<P>Now, as to my journey, I came in the &s;tage, attend|ed only by my maid Ann, who has engaged to &s;tay with me until I return. She is a &s;ober, well-behaved girl; is enamoured with the regularity of the family, and wi&s;hes &s;he could always live in &s;uch an one.</P>
<P>As there was nothing uncommon in our journey, I &s;hall pa&s;s it over. But as to what you &s;aid, about my marrying without my father's con&s;ent, and &s;tealing a march upon them, and then exulting in their mortifi|cation, I &s;hall never agree to it: for I hold my&s;elf bound to obey my father &s;till, as much as if he had not u&s;ed me with &s;uch &s;everity; and I &s;hall not be mar|ried without his con&s;ent, if it is po&s;&s;ible to obtain it. But I can make little dependence on that; although my uncle has promi&s;ed to gain his con&s;ent, if po&s;&s;ible. When you are married, I hope you will write to in|form me; and if you write by the po&s;t, I &s;hall &s;oon get your letters.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XVI. From Mrs. <HI>SOPHIA GRANBE,</HI> to Mi&s;s POLLY GRANVILLE.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My Dear Mi&s;s Polly,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR letter has been received, and has given me very plea&s;ing &s;en&s;ations; to think you was &s;o delightfully received by your uncle and aunt. What a good and amiable man your uncle is! One that is formed to &s;oothe the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, ea&s;e the burden|ed, and comfort the troubled. You may well feel your&s;elf ea&s;y in &s;uch a hou&s;e as his is; it being every way calculated to allay the troubles of the mind. For where there is &s;o much good nature, mode&s;ty, regu|larity, and real religion, one cannot help being calm in one's mind. A &s;hip's crew, that for many days, has been beaten, and drove about with a violent &s;torm, and all at once, find them&s;elves in a &s;afe and commo|dious harbour, mu&s;t feel a &s;atisfaction inexpre&s;&s;ible: &s;o it mu&s;t have been with my dear Mi&s;s Polly, after having e&s;caped the rocks and quick&s;ands which you had like to been driven among; to find your&s;elf in &s;o good a harbour as your uncle's is. And I do greatly rejoice that you have got &s;afely at your uncle's hou&s;e.</P>
<P>But now, as to my own affairs; I have been mar|ried the&s;e two months, and have got to hou&s;e-keeping, if you'll believe me. Perhaps you may think that we were in ha&s;te. But Mr. Granbe's circum&s;tances required it; and what objection could I have to it? Well, you will want to know how my&mdash;what &s;hall I call him? Why, a hu&s;band&mdash;and &s;o there you have the word at large. Well, as I was going to &s;ay, you will want to know how he behaves to me. Why, very politely. But he is not one of tho&s;e frantic lovers, that heap all upon one at once; and then have no more to &s;ay about love, or affections all their days after|ward.
<PB N="49" REF="033734_0047_0FF8F12307282B28">
But he leaves &s;omething for improvement; and indeed, he does improve in his attentions to me every day. And then, he is always the mo&s;t complai|&s;ant to me in company: and never &s;ays any thing at my expen&s;e, in company. There are &s;ome men, that will &s;ay &s;hocking things of their wives, only to rai&s;e a laugh in company; and don't think of what will be the effect; which will inevitably be this, that other men will take the &s;ame liberty of &s;peech with them, they do them&s;elves. But Mr. Granbe is not a&s;hamed to be polite to, and tender of me, in company: Indeed he is a very regular, &s;ober man in his hou&s;e; and keeps up tho&s;e regulations in his family, that you &s;peak &s;o highly of in your uncle. And he being a man that has all my affections and e&s;teem, I feel my&s;elf entirely ea&s;y in my &s;ituation.</P>
<P>Well now, one word about your father; he has met with &s;ome capital lo&s;&s;es &s;ince you went away, which has con&s;iderably perplexed his affairs; and I heard, by the bye, that he applied to your broth|er Murfee for a&s;&s;i&s;tance; and that he refu&s;ed to help him. For Murfee is ju&s;t &s;uch another as him&s;elf. And he might well think he would not help him. He will look well at home, and let others &s;hift for them|&s;elves: for he does not care who &s;inks, if he can &s;wim. But I feel grieved for your mother; for &s;he is cer|tainly a delightful woman! Indeed &s;he is.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XVII. From Mrs. <HI>GRANVILLE,</HI> to her Daughter POLLY.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Ever Dear Daughter,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS I have not written you a letter &s;ince you have been at your uncle's, except ju&s;t to inform you of our health, &amp;c.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="033734_0048_0FF8F1292136CAD8">I will now inform you of our circum&s;tances, which are in a di&s;tre&s;sful &s;ituation. For we have lo&s;t a &s;hip, and a brig: both richly loaded. The &s;hip returning from the Ea&s;t-Indies, with a very valuable cargo, was ca&s;t away, and all lo&s;t. The brig met with the &s;ame fate; and the re&s;t of our &s;hipping have made but &s;mall returns. In con&s;equence of the&s;e lo&s;&s;es, your father has been obliged to mortgage the large&s;t part of his landed intere&s;t; and in vain has he applied to your brother Murfee for relief; although the e&s;tate is mort|gaged for not more than half of its real value; and though he offered to &s;ecure the lands to your brother, if he would only take up the mortgage, &s;o that the e&s;tate might not go out of the family; yet he refu&s;ed, and returned him this an&s;wer, that he would not in|volve him&s;elf to help another out of difficulty. And if he had been &s;o unwi&s;e, as to run him&s;elf into irre|trievable ruin, he mu&s;t abide by the con&s;equence.</P>
<P>You and your &s;i&s;ter Jenny, are all the children we have left; for Murfee has wholly abandoned us: and your father has u&s;ed Mr. Danford and you &s;o roughly, that if Mr. Danford was at home, and you were mar|ried, we could not expect any relief from you. The thoughts of which, together with our pre&s;ent di&s;tre&s;s, is almo&s;t too much for me.</P>
<P>But this trouble has had &s;o good effect on your father, that it has opened his eyes, to &s;ee the difference between riches and virtue. And he &s;ays, that he re|pents heartily of his folly, in u&s;ing Mr. Danford and you with &s;uch &s;everity; and wi&s;hes to &s;ee Mr. Dan|ford, that he might immediately a&s;k his forgivene&s;s, and make an offer of you to him. He is, al&s;o, re|joiced to think, that you e&s;caped Mr. Stapleton.</P>
<P>I can now inform you, that Mr. Stapleton is mar|ried, and to ju&s;t &s;uch another as him&s;elf; and, that they live very unhappily together. Indeed they have had their hou&s;e on fire two or three times, already; and, at &s;uch times, &s;he &s;eeks refuge at her father's; and then Mr. Stapleton has nothing to do, but to tackle his coach and go after her. And after &s;ome abatement
<PB N="51" REF="033734_0049_0FF8BF9573EB1F58">
on both &s;ides, &s;he is willing to go home with him a|gain: and thus they mu&s;t wear out a mi&s;erable life together; being never likely to enjoy any peace or happine&s;s in this world. And what a ble&s;&s;ing it is, my dear, that you &s;teered clear of this rock!</P>
<P>My dear child, you mu&s;t forgive your father; in|deed you mu&s;t! For he loves you as well as a father ought to love a child: and I really believe, that his &s;everity to you, at that time, was de&s;igned by him for your good. But your father thinks otherwi&s;e now; for he &s;ees there is a great di&s;parity between virtue and vice; and that virtue, with poverty, is preferable to vice accompanied with riches; and &s;o, Polly, you will forgive your father, won't you? And I &s;hould be glad if you would &s;end us a letter, and tell us whether you can, and will forgive us, or not. And O, that you was here with us. But all in good time&punc; For I &s;up|po&s;e you look for Mr. Danford, by this time; and I would not deprive you of an interview with him, at his arrival, by de&s;iring you to come home; knowing that his ab&s;ence has been very tedious to you; your heart, I know, being always with him. For you two &s;eem to be formed for each other: and I hope, ere long, you will &s;tand in a nearer relation to one another, than you have heretofore done.</P>
<P>As to our misfortunes, they are very grievous to the mind; being repugnant to nature, and an idea of grandeur. But, no doubt, they are de&s;igned for our good, and, perhaps, will terminate for our happine&s;s in this world, as well as in that which is to come; for it will certainly &s;erve to wean us from the world. And I think it has had a good effect on your father already; who has become a great advocate for virtue, and &s;peaks well of religion. And now, my dear daughter, let us live in this world, as if we expected that this was not our abiding place; and let us u&s;e the things of this world as only lent to us, and be willing to part with them at any time, when the great Be&s;tower of every ble&s;&s;ing &s;hall think be&s;t to deprive us of them. For we, and all we have, are at his di&s;po&s;al. And it is be&s;t for us to rejoice at all times, that we are in his hands, who
<PB N="52" REF="033734_0050_0FF8F132E025A510">
cannot do a wrong thing: "For &s;hall not the God of all the earth do right?" And my dear child, let us &s;o live, as that we &s;hall not be afraid to die.</P>
<P>That you may be returned to us in peace, experience every ble&s;&s;ing while in this world, and at la&s;t be re|ceived by your Judge in peace, is the earne&s;t prayer of your affectionate mother,</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XVIII. From Mi&s;s <HI>POLLY GRANVILLE,</HI> to her Mother.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear and Honoured Mother,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I RECEIVED your kind letter; and it greatly rejoiced my heart, to find you &s;o kind to me, and to have you relate your affairs to me, e&s;pecially my father's reformation. And, dear ma'am, if the lo&s;s of his e&s;tate has opened his eyes, to &s;ee the empti|ne&s;s of the things of this world, when compared to virtue; and to &s;ee the preference of religion to riches; I think he has gained more than he has lo&s;t. And O, ma'am, how acceptable was my father's ble&s;&s;ing to me, which I prize above all my father's e&s;tate. Upon reading your kind letter, to find my father was well inclined to Mr. Danford, and that he gave his con&s;ent to our marriage; and then to receive his ble&s;&s;ing in form, was almo&s;t too much for me. Tears of joy ran plentifully from my eyes; and, indeed, it &s;eemed to rai&s;e me above my&s;elf; and I was in &s;uch an ec&s;tacy,
<PB N="53" REF="033734_0051_0FF8F1378598FFA8">
that 'twas &s;ome time before I could find my&s;elf de|&s;cended to my proper orbit again.</P>
<P>As for my father, I do mo&s;t heartily forgive, and will entirely forget whatever he has done, that was grievous to me. And, dear ma'am, tell him that I will do all in my power, to extricate him out of his pre&s;ent embarra&s;&s;ment. You know the e&s;tate that my uncle left me, has been let for a number of years, and the rent is now due; which, with the money that I have on intere&s;t, will amount to a con&s;iderable &s;um; and, if he chu&s;es, he may call on my tru&s;tee for that money, before my return.</P>
<P>But I hope it will not be long before I &s;hall have the happine&s;s of throwing my&s;elf before you both, and receiving your ble&s;&s;ing from your own mouths. For Mr. Danford has arrived here, having made a capital return; and will accompany this, with a letter to my father.</P>
<P>I &s;howed him the letter that I received from you; and he was much plea&s;ed that my father was reconcil|ed to him. My uncle will write, and therefore I &s;hall not &s;ay any thing about him. And I &s;uppo&s;e you have &s;een the letter I &s;ent to Mrs. Sophia Granbe; for which rea&s;ons, I &s;hall not give you any account of my uncle's family; only that they continue to &s;how me every mark of affection and kindne&s;s; and &s;eem to be as tender of me, as if I was one of their daughters. My uncle is &s;et upon it, that I &s;hall be married at his hou&s;e: he always calls me his elde&s;t daughter; and he &s;ays, his elde&s;t daughter &s;hall not be married out of his hou&s;e.</P>

<P>PERMIT me to addre&s;s you with a line on a very tender and intere&s;ting &s;ubject; and, dear Sir, let it meet with your approbation. When I ar|rived at this place, Mr. Finter informed me that your daughter was at his hou&s;e; and invited me to wait up|on her, which I did with the greate&s;t plea&s;ure imagi|nable: for I need not inform you, that &s;he engro&s;&s;es all my attention, and that my heart is wholly her's; and &s;orry I am, that there was any mi&s;under&s;tanding between you and I. But I flatter my&s;elf, that what you did at that time proceeded from a true paternal care of, and affection towards your daughter, and not to any per&s;onal di&s;like to my&s;elf. In hopes of a more favourable reception, I venture to addre&s;s you on that &s;ubject again, and a&s;k your con&s;ent to our marriage. And if &s;uch an alliance will be agreeable to you&punc; Sir, may not I expect to have a letter from you? For I mu&s;t tell you, that I cannot make my&s;elf happy with|out I can call her my own; for my worldly happine&s;s doth greatly depend on that alliance.</P>
<P>I hope, Sir, you will forgive me in every particu|lar, wherein I might have incurred your di&s;plea&s;ure in times pa&s;t; and will re&s;t a&s;&s;ured of your kind conde|&s;cen&s;ion towards me, and &s;hall hold my&s;elf obliged to obey you in what&s;oever commands you &s;hall be plea&s;|ed to lay upon me.

<P>WE have heard of your lo&s;&s;es and mi&s;|fortunes, and do truly &s;ympathize with you in your troubles. But we mu&s;t con&s;ider that the&s;e are all the doings of Providence, who&s;e ways are pa&s;t finding out, and knows how to lay afflictions on his children; and at the &s;ame time, bring good out of evil. For many times he doth try them in the furnace of affliction, that tho&s;e virtues, which lay buried in the dro&s;s of the world, may &s;hine forth and be con&s;picuous to tho&s;e that are around them. And I doubt not, but the&s;e afflictions of your's will all work for your good. Nay, I am morally certain, that they will. You mu&s;t be patient, arming your mind with virtue and religion.</P>
<P>But I have another &s;ubject to write upon: for Mr. Danford has returned from the Ea&s;t Indies, and has arrived here with the riche&s;t cargo I ever &s;aw. He has taken up his lodgings at my hou&s;e, and I am en|amoured with him. For indeed, brother, he is every thing one could wi&s;h for in a gentleman. He has a noble mind, that is above every little action, is &s;ober, virtuous, and well-bred: and, in &s;hort, he is endowed with every accompli&s;hment that will be|&s;peak one's e&s;teem and affections. I under&s;tand you did not affect Mr. Danford before he went his voyage; but I hope you have thought better of the matter &s;ince: for I mu&s;t tell you, that if he addre&s;&s;ed one of my daughters, and had not the tenth part of the e&s;tate which he now has, yet I &s;hould rather encourage him, than that &s;he &s;hould be married to one of an independ|ent fortune, who wanted his endowments. And as

And I intend &s;he &s;hall be married at my hou&s;e, and you mu&s;t give your con&s;ent to both of the&s;e propo&s;als; for indeed, I cannot be denied.

<PB N="57" REF="033734_0055_0FF8BFA1C69A46F0">
I am &s;ure, Sir, you never wronged me in the lea&s;t&mdash; your behaviour, Sir, was ever con&s;i&s;tent with virtue, and a religious mind&mdash;whil&s;t mine was quite the rever&s;e. For at that time my whole mind was &s;et on riches and grandeur. But &s;ince your ab&s;ence, I have experien|ced &s;uch vici&s;&s;itudes in fortune, as I think hath fully opened my eyes. And now it appears to me, that wealth ought not to be mentioned in compari&s;on of virtue. Indeed, Sir, religion appears beautiful to me. And now I hope you will not look upon me with ab|horrence, as I know you love tho&s;e who love relig|ion.</P>
<P>You wrote to me for my con&s;ent to your entering into an alliance with our family, which I freely grant with plea&s;ure: and you may either bring Polly home before you are married, or may complete your happi|ne&s;s at my brother's&mdash;as you chu&s;e. For my brother is &s;omewhat earne&s;t that the ceremony &s;hould be per|formed at his hou&s;e. I &s;hall expect you will pay your compliments to us as &s;oon as you conveniently can: for you mu&s;t not re&s;ent my conduct to you. And as I know you are of a kind, forgiving temper, I doubt not but you will overlook tho&s;e faults I have been guilty of. And do tell Polly, that &s;he &s;hould forgive me the wrong I have done her, and not think hard of me. For at that time I did really think, that I was &s;eeking her good. But a per&s;on that is blinded with the world, will many times do wrong things; and let her be a&s;&s;ured, that I love her as well as a father ought to love a child&mdash;Jenny and &s;he, being all the children that we have left.</P>
<P>Mr. Murfee's behaviour towards us, has been quite exceptionable: for he de&s;erted us in the greate&s;t of our difficulty, and has quite for&s;aken our family. But all is for the be&s;t, for it gave me a di&s;like to tho&s;e men who make this world their god; and it gave me a rel|i&s;h to virtue and religion. And I do rejoice now that tho&s;e things have befallen me.</P>
<P>And now, dear Sir, let me commend you to the di|vine care and keeping; and may we live in the exer|ci&s;e

<P>I RECEIVED your kind letter with plea&s;ure, being rejoiced to hear of your welfare. And O, how acceptable was your kind condolence for our affliction, and your &s;o &s;ea&s;onable advice to us under tho&s;e misfort|unes! It &s;eemed like a cordial to the fainting heart. And indeed, brother, the letters that we have received from your hou&s;e, have put new life into us. For the ways of Providence, many times, appear to us to be in|tricate and full of windings, and we can no ways com|prehend them. But how often is it that the&s;e things which we think are again&s;t us, are the very means de&s;igned for our good. And how often is it that tho&s;e adver&s;e providences towards us, work a change in our minds, and brings the creature to &s;ee his dependance on the Supreme Being. When this is the ca&s;e, the per&s;on afflicted, can ki&s;s the rod, and &s;ay, "It is good for me that I have been afflicted." And I humbly hope, that this is the effect which trouble hath pro|duced in my mind: for the world doth not appear to me as it u&s;ed to. And indeed I think I have a real love for virtue and religion. I believe you will re|joice at this declaration, as coming from one that u&s;ed to make the world his chiefe&s;t good. But, dear Sir, you mu&s;t own me now for a brother, in a double &s;en&s;e. And I flatter my&s;elf that you will&mdash;for I know that virtue and religion was ever your boa&s;t, and you ever
<PB N="59" REF="033734_0057_0FF8F14FAF9FD560">
&s;eemed to live above the world, although your po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ions were large in it. This is the more admirable in you, as it is rare, for a very rich man to mind tho&s;e things which will terminate in true happine&s;s.</P>
<P>As to what you wrote to me, concerning Mr. Danford, and Polly, I have wrote to Mr. Danford, and have given my con&s;ent to their union; it will be needle&s;s for me to &s;ay any thing to you about it. You wrote to me, de&s;iring, that they might be married at your hou&s;e. I &s;hould be very glad to have the cere|mony performed at my hou&s;e. But, as my daughter Polly found a father in you; I &s;hall &s;ubmit the mat|ter to have it performed, where it &s;hall be mo&s;t agree|able to you.</P>
<P>As to your recommendation of Mr. Danford, I mu&s;t tell you, that he now &s;tands as high in my e&s;teem, as he does, or can do, in yours. And I now &s;ee the folly, in doing, as I did, by him and Polly. For I really carried my re&s;entment to an outrageous extremity. But as I now repent of my folly, I hope they will both forgive me. And I am determined to a&s;k their forgivene&s;s in form. You mu&s;t tell them, that I have fully repented of what I did to them; and try to en|gage them to think well of me; and I know they are both of a kind forgiving temper; therefore, I flatter my|&s;elf, that they will be reconciled to me, and that we &s;hall yet be happy in each other.</P>
<P>Your &s;i&s;ter de&s;ires to join with me, in &s;ending our love to you and your family. That the&s;e may find you as they leave us, enjoying health, and peace of mind, prays your affectionate brother, and humble &s;ervant,</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXIII. From Mi&s;s <HI>POLLY GRANVILLE,</HI> to Mrs. SOPHIA GRANBE.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My dear Mrs. Granbe,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I MUST write you the particulars of Mr. Danford's arrival, and al&s;o of our marriage. As to the fir&s;t, my uncle came home one day, and &s;aid he had been in company with a choice friend of his, and that he had invited him to take tea with us in the afternoon, de&s;iring the family might be properly dre&s;&s;ed to re|ceive him. And as he was a particular friend of his, he hoped we would receive him as politely as po&s;&s;ible. All this time I did not in the lea&s;t mi&s;tru&s;t who it &s;hould be; but my aunt told me afterwards that &s;he did; for, upon her a&s;king my uncle who this friend of his could be, whom he wi&s;hed us to receive with &s;o much parade? He an&s;wered, that perhaps &s;he might know him when he came; and &s;o waved the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>Well, after dining, we all dre&s;&s;ed anew; and the whole hou&s;e was &s;o di&s;po&s;ed, as to receive the un|known &s;tranger with all the politene&s;s imaginable. My aunt, her daughter, and I, were &s;etting together in the parlour, when my uncle entered, and with him Mr. Danford, Upon &s;eeing him I aro&s;e, and immediately run into his arms; for the &s;urpri&s;e was &s;o &s;udden, I knew not what I did. O, Mr. Danford, &s;aid I. And indeed that was all I could &s;ay; for the interview was too much for my weak frame of body to bear; and I fainted in his arms, which greatly perplexed the com|pany; but they &s;oon recovered me again. My dear, &s;aid my aunt to my uncle, you did not do well to &s;ur|prize our niece to this degree. But my uncle &s;aid that he did not in the lea&s;t expect it would have had &s;uch an effect on me; and that I mu&s;t forgive him.</P>
<P>After the fir&s;t emotion was over, Mr. Danford &s;aid
<PB N="61" REF="033734_0059_0FF8F1538D37E940">
a hundred tender things to me, and &s;oothed me in the be&s;t manner he could. And indeed, he never appeared to me in &s;uch an amiable light before; for he was richly dre&s;&s;ed: and be&s;ides, there was that noblene&s;s in his looks, which denotes real grandeur, and con&s;ci|ous greatne&s;s. And he &s;eemed to be more tender of me now, than when I was in pro&s;perity in my fath|er's hou&s;e; and &s;ays, he is glad it is in his power to retrieve my father's affairs, which, he &s;ays, he means to do, as &s;oon as he arrives in tho&s;e parts again, My dear Polly, &s;aid he to me, you mu&s;t not think hard of me, though your &s;ufferings have been great on my ac|count; nor for my leaving this country at the time of your trouble; for it was attended with pungent grief to me; and was wholly on your account in order to gain you your liberty. And I cannot but hope, that your father thinks more favourably of me by this time. Dear Sir, &s;aid I, you know my mind relative to your going abroad; and it is matter of joy to me, and ex|alts you in my e&s;teem, that you did not abandon me under the in&s;ulting treatment you met with, from my father. But I know, Sir, that you are not capable of any meanne&s;s; that your mind is &s;teady and con|&s;i&s;tent; and I ever &s;uppo&s;ed it was &s;afe tru&s;ting to your word. And as to what you &s;aid concerning my father's thinking better of you now than formerly, I can a&s;&s;ure you, Sir, that he does: for I have a letter, in my hands, which makes it obvious that my father's mind is quite altered from what it u&s;ed to be.</P>
<P>And indeed, Mrs. Granbe, his eyes gli&s;tened with noble &s;en&s;ibility And there &s;eems to be a meaning in every turn of his countenance. Well, after he had &s;eated him&s;elf again, I put my mother's letter into his hand which contained the particulars of my father's af|fairs; which he read &s;everal times over; and then &s;aid, I am exceeding &s;orry for your father's misfor|tune. But, as your mother writes, it may be all for the be&s;t. As for Mr. Murfee, it &s;eems he has behav|ed in a mo&s;t &s;hocking manner. Not to a&s;&s;i&s;t in their di&s;tre&s;s, the family he is &s;o nearly connected with, di&s;|covers neither the &s;on, nor the humane heart. How
<PB N="62" REF="033734_0060_0FF8F155F0EA9928">
could he be &s;o cruel? Is it po&s;&s;ible that the noble crea|ture, man, &s;hould be &s;o void of humanity? But your father, my dear Polly, &s;tands high in my e&s;teem; and I love him with a real affection. And it &s;hall be one of my fir&s;t concerns, when I return home, to &s;et your father on as good a footing as he was before. There ever was a dignity in that man's looks, which excited my veneration. And now to have the gracious mind, joined to his other noble qualifications, will really &s;et him in a &s;phere above any in tho&s;e parts. What &s;ay you, Polly, to the&s;e propo&s;itions?</P>
<P>Dear Sir, &s;aid I, &s;uch genero&s;ity, and unmerited kindne&s;s, is almo&s;t too much for me to bear. And what &s;hall I do on my part, to de&s;erve all this good|ne&s;s from you? But it is con&s;i&s;tent with your noble turn of mind. You will then forgive my father, and think well of him, and forget what he hath done to you? Yes, my dear, &s;aid he, I will. For I ever thought that his &s;everity was owing to his love to you. For, though his aims were wrong, yet, doubtle&s;s, his inten|tions were good. And it is our duty to think as well of him now, &s;ince he has repented of that evil, as if he had never been guilty of it. Dear Sir, &s;aid I, your genero&s;ity is without an equal; and it &s;hall be my care to merit as much with you as I can.</P>
<P>My uncle and aunt al&s;o gave their minds on this topic; but I have confined my&s;elf wholly to what he &s;aid on the &s;ubject. Well, Mr. Danford took up his lodgings at my uncle's, upon his invitation; &s;o that we were more or le&s;s together every day. Mr. Danford wrote to my father for his con&s;ent to our mar|riage, and received an an&s;wer full of kind expre&s;&s;ions, with a cheerful con&s;ent to our marriage, which rai&s;ed every tender emotion in Mr. Danford, and occa&s;ioned his &s;aying many tender things to me on that &s;ubject. Indeed, he is always full of complacency to me; and is exceeding polite to me in company; ever &s;howing me that preference, when in company, which is cha|racteri&s;tic of the real lover, and generous mind.</P>
<P>My uncle wrote to my father for his con&s;ent to our being married at his hou&s;e; which my father gave him,
<PB N="63" REF="033734_0061_0FF8F158DC21A130">
in a letter full of endearing expre&s;&s;ions, at lea&s;t they were &s;o to me, for it was a penitent one; my father condemning him&s;elf, and &s;peaking exceeding well of virtue, which was plea&s;ing to us all. But my uncle &s;aid, that my father ever &s;tood high in his e&s;teem; and he thought that he never lacked but one thing, which was religion. And now he is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of that qualifica|tion, he mu&s;t, in my e&s;teem, out&s;hine any that I know of.</P>
<P>And Polly, &s;aid he, you may, and ought to rejoice, that you have &s;uffered; for that, I believe, has partly been the means of opening his eyes. And you may now return to your father, who will &s;et more by you than if you had never offended him: and I hope nei|ther Mr. Danford, nor you, will retain the lea&s;t re&s;ent|ment again&s;t him. But, on the contrary, endeavour to &s;oothe him, mitigate his affliction, and make his mind as ea&s;y as po&s;&s;ible, under his pre&s;ent difficulties; and you will be richly paid for what you do for him&punc; even in worldly intere&s;t: for your father is yet in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a con&s;iderable e&s;tate.</P>
<P>Mr. Danford &s;aid, that he would make it one of his fir&s;t concerns after his return home, to deliver my fath|er out of all difficulty. And as for his behaviour to him in times pa&s;t, he &s;hould entirely bury it in oblivion&punc; I al&s;o a&s;&s;ured my uncle, that my parents &s;hould have no rea&s;on to find fault with my behaviour to them. I am rejoiced, &s;aid my uncle, to hear you make this de|claration! And as my brother has con&s;ented for you to be married at my hou&s;e, agreeable to the reque&s;t I made in my letter to him, you may &s;et the time when the ceremony &s;hall be performed, and we will make prepa|rations accordingly.</P>
<P>Mr. Danford &s;aid that he wi&s;hed to have his happi|ne&s;s completed, as &s;oon as it conveniently could be, and &s;o they &s;et the day. After this, my uncle brought home &s;everal pieces of &s;ilk, for me to choo&s;e a &s;uit out of; and would in&s;i&s;t on my making a choice, which I accordingly did. He furni&s;hed me with a &s;uit com|plete, and Mr. Danford gave me a &s;econd-day &s;uit. Now you will think that your Polly was gorgeou&s;ly apparelled; well, &s;o I was, and they would have it &s;o; for my uncle intended to invite many of his friends,
<PB N="64" REF="033734_0062_0FF8F15B17E314F0">
to attend the nuptials. Well, at length the appointed time came; but I did not find my&s;elf cheerful as u&s;ual; neither could I make my&s;elf &s;o for the life of me. In|deed I have often wondered how a per&s;on can enter into that &s;olemn covenant, with &s;uch gaiety, and thoughtle&s;&s;ne&s;s as I have &s;een &s;ome: for it doth ap|pear to me to be a &s;olemn undertaking; and it always u&s;ed to impre&s;s my mind with awe, to &s;ee a couple mar|ried. But then, many look upon marriage to be only a ceremony, prefixed by the civil authority, to oblige a man to take care of his wife, and to keep families from &s;eparating. But I always looked upon marriage to be a divine ordinance; and it is obvious from the word of truth, that it is &s;o. But now, when I came to enter into that covenant my&s;elf, it appeared more awful to me than ever. But I was re&s;olved to hold up as well as I could.</P>
<P>Well, the me&s;&s;enger coming in to inform us, that they were ready to receive us, Mr. Danford took me by the hand, and &s;pake very encouraging to me; &s;o we &s;tepped into the other room; but tremble, trem|ble went my feet all the way! Lay &s;till, &s;aid I, you little fool! why &s;hould you be &s;o unea&s;y? For my heart was ready to leave its orbit. After the fir&s;t flut|ter was over, I held up better, while the ceremony was performing, than I was afraid I &s;hould.</P>
<P>As to our gue&s;ts, my uncle had got together a noble circle of the be&s;t gentry in the city; and after the nup|tials were over, they were nobly entertained by him; and all was conducted in a mode&s;t, &s;ociable manner; and after we had &s;pent a very agreeable evening to|gether, the company withdrew, about eleven; and the next day we had again a con&s;iderable company; and indeed we were obliged to give up the whole week to entertainment and plea&s;ure. We had &s;o much parade, that I was quite tired of it.</P>
<P>Well, the next Sunday I mu&s;t be dre&s;&s;ed to the be&s;t advantage, to make our public appearance at church&punc; For my uncle is a man of note here, and Mr. Danford is looked upon very highly in this city; all &s;eeming to be fond of an acquaintance with him. After dre&s;&s;ing
<PB N="65" REF="033734_0063_0FF8F16049337FD0">
my&s;elf very richly, agreeable to their de&s;ire, we &s;et out, attended by my uncle and aunt, and a young couple, that my uncle invited for that purpo&s;e. When we came to the meeting hou&s;e, my uncle aided us into his pew; but it gave me another flutter, in &s;pite of all I could do; for the eyes of all the congregation were upon us. But the &s;olemnity of the place awed my mind into a frame of devotion; and &s;o I held up bet|ter than I expected.</P>
<P>There was nothing more occurred that was remark|able, except that the next week we were crowded with company.</P>
<P>Now, I will tell you what preparations we are in to return to my father's. As Mr. Danford did not own a coach, he has bought one here; and &s;o we &s;hall ride home in &s;tate. But we &s;hall not be accompanied by any be&s;ides my maid and the coachman.</P>
<P>I forgot to tell you, that Mr. Danford, before we were married, pre&s;ented my maid Ann with a new &s;uit, which mightily plea&s;ed her.</P>
<P>Mr. Danford has adju&s;ted all his affairs relative to the cargo he has had unloaded here; and the Captain is to proceed with the &s;hip, whil&s;t we go by land. We &s;hall &s;et out &s;ometime next week, &s;o that you may &s;oon expect us in your part of the country again. I long to receive my father's ble&s;&s;ing from his own mouth, and again to embrace my dear So|phia. With which plea&s;ing hopes, I ha&s;ten to &s;ub|&s;cribe my&s;elf your's,</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXIV. From Mrs. <HI>POLLY DANFORD,</HI> to her Un|cle and Aunt <HI>FINTER.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Ever dear, and much honour'd Uncle and Aunt,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS you engaged me to write to you, and inform you of our arrival at my father's hou&s;e, and how he received us, &amp;c. and as it was ever a plea&s;|ure to me to obey my &s;econd father and mother, as I u&s;ed to call you, I will proceed, hoping you will make allowances for my imperfections.</P>
<P>Setting out from your hou&s;e at Philadelphia, we came by ea&s;y journies, &s;topping a day or two at eve|ry town of note, till we arrived at this town, and put up at Mr. Danford's cou&s;in Fitcher's. Mr. Fitcher is a very polite gentleman, but as we did not arrive till dark, we had no company that night, and glad I was that we had not.</P>
<P>Mr. Danford and Mr. Fitcher had much di&s;cour&s;e about my father. Mr. Fitcher &s;aid, he believed my father would be able to carry on his trade, though he had met with great lo&s;&s;es. But his landed intere&s;t was mortgaged; and he believed that his farms mu&s;t be lo&s;t to him, as he did not think it po&s;&s;ible for him to redeem them, which was a pity&mdash;for they were mort|gaged for not more than one half of their real value. And upon Mr. Danford's enquiry, he told him, that the mortgage was not out, and that the man who held the deeds was my father's friend; and wanted nothing more, than to be made whole, and would give them up at any time.</P>
<P>The next morning Mr. Danford went to &s;ee the man who had the deeds, and &s;oon after came in and delivered me all the deeds of my father's farms, (and you know he was in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;everal farms.) Up|on handing me the papers, he &s;aid, my dear, you may
<PB N="67" REF="033734_0065_0FF8BF9A79AF0F30">
give them to your father, or I will my&s;elf, as you &s;hall think proper. But I returned him the papers, chu&s;ing he &s;hould deliver them him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Soon after, Mr. Danford &s;ent a &s;ervant to my fath|er's, to inform him that we were in town, and if he wi&s;hed to &s;ee us at his hou&s;e, and to know when he would have us wait upon him, who returned for an&s;wer, that he &s;hould expect us in the afternoon. Accord|ingly, after dining, we went in the coach. Mr. Dan|ford would have me dre&s;&s;ed in the &s;uit my uncle gave me, and he was charmingly dre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf.</P>
<P>When we arrived at my father's, we were met at the door, and conducted into the parlour, where my fath|er and mother were waiting, ready to receive us.&mdash; When we entered the parlour, my father, ri&s;ing, &s;aid, welcome, Mr. Danford, into the&s;e parts again; and thrice welcome to my hou&s;e! And after Mr. Dan|ford had returned him the u&s;ual compliment of thanks, my father, &s;tepping to him, took his hand and &s;aid, I a&s;k your forgivene&s;s, Sir, for the ill u&s;age I &s;howed you before you went your Ea&s;tern voyage.&mdash; Sir, &s;aid Mr. Danford, you did nothing uncommon to me&mdash;nothing at lea&s;t, that requires forgivene&s;s: but if you are anxious, Sir, for a further declaration, I am ready to &s;atisfy you. And if you think you have done any thing to me that was unbecoming a gentle|man in your capacity, I do freely forgive you. And &s;hall ever re&s;pect and behave towards you, as if there never had been any mi&s;under&s;tanding between us: and hope, Sir, that I &s;hall be enabled to conduct my&s;elf towards you and others, that you will not di&s;dain to call me your &s;on. At this, Mr. Danford took me by the hand and pre&s;ented me to him, &s;aying, dear Sir, your daughter&mdash;will you be plea&s;ed to receive her in|to favour, and give her your ble&s;&s;ing?</P>
<P>My father took me by the hand, and I dropping on my knees before him, &s;aid, dear Sir, will you forgive your Polly, and grant her your ble&s;&s;ing? At this, my father rai&s;ing me up, &s;aid, &s;tand up, my dear child&mdash;for I want to a&s;k you, whether you can, and will forgive me freely from your heart, all the &s;everi|ty
<PB N="68" REF="033734_0066_0FF8F143F7BB3E10">
that I u&s;ed towards you? Dear Sir, &s;aid I, you mu&s;t not a&s;k your Polly &s;uch a que&s;tion! But Polly, &s;aid he, if you can forgive me, you mu&s;t &s;ay you will. Dear Sir, &s;aid I, I do forgive you whatever you may have done ami&s;s to me: and now, Sir, you will give me your ble&s;&s;ing and receive me into favour again, won't you?</P>
<P>My ble&s;&s;ing you have, &s;aid he, and may you both be a ble&s;&s;ing to each other! And may you enjoy the be&s;t of heaven's ble&s;&s;ings; and be an honour to the place you live in! And I am &s;atisfied, becau&s;e you are returned to us in peace; and do not de&s;pi&s;e us, but will yet look upon us with love, and filial affections. Then turning to my mother, he &s;aid, my dear, here I pre&s;ent you with a &s;on and daughter, that would do honour to any family on earth.</P>
<P>Then my mother took us both by the hand, and wel|comed us to her hou&s;e. Saying, that &s;he promi&s;ed her&s;elf great comfort in us, &s;eeing the former mi&s;un|der&s;tandings were to be buried in oblivion. After we were &s;eated, and had got into conver&s;ation, Mr. Dan|ford a&s;ked my father concerning the perplexed &s;tate of his affairs, which he has hinted at in his letter to him? And whether he had been able to extricate him&s;elf out of the&s;e difficulties, that he then laboured under?</P>
<P>My father an&s;wered, that his affairs were much in the &s;ame &s;ituation that they were when he wrote; only, that he believed he was rather upon the gaining hand.</P>
<P>At this, Mr. Danford &s;tepped to him, and gave him the mortgage deeds, which he had purcha&s;ed; and &s;aid, there is a &s;mall pre&s;ent, Sir; and if you are el&s;ewhere involved, and will notice the matter to me, I &s;hall hold my&s;elf obligated to extricate you as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible. But when my father came to &s;ee what he gave him, he ro&s;e up, and &s;aid, Sir, your kindne&s;s is too great for me to bear! But as you have done this, I will imme|diately put you into the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all tho&s;e farms that you have re&s;tored to me</P>
<P>Sir, &s;aid Mr. Danford, I did not pre&s;ent them to you to be repaid again; and I &s;hall not receive any &s;e|curity on that account.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="033734_0067_0FF8F1650C6BE6B0">Now I &s;ee, &s;aid my father, the triumph of the vir|tuous mind over the covetous worldling. For there is no compari&s;on between the man that &s;quares all his doings by the rule of religion; and one that makes this world his idol, and is hurried on by an impetuous de|&s;ire after riches and grandeur. Then turning to my mother, &s;aid, how unlike this, was our &s;on Murfee? For we offered him the land, if he would only take up the deeds, &s;o that the e&s;tate might not go into the hands of a &s;tranger. But he refu&s;ed us with contempt; and made him&s;elf &s;trange to our family, and forgot the duty of a child to a parent. But then, Murfee is wholly a man of this world, and makes no di&s;tinction between virtue and vice; riches and grandeur appearing to be the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential articles in his creed. And we &s;ee, my dear, continued he, in every occurrence of life, the preference of virtue to wealth. And I de&s;ire to be thankful, that of late my eyes have been opened in &s;uch a mea&s;ure as to make the di&s;tinction. Then turning to Mr. Danford, &s;aid, I acknowledge, Sir, that the kindne&s;s you have done me is great; and that the prin|ciple from which you govern the&s;e actions mu&s;t be wholly centered in virtue. And, in future, I &s;hall look upon you in as near a relation as if you were my own &s;on: and &s;hall in&s;i&s;t upon your joining your inte|re&s;t with mine, that we may carry on an in&s;eparable trade together: and what I have in the world you mu&s;t look upon as your own. And you mu&s;t not think of living in any hou&s;e but mine. It is capacious enough for two families; and you mu&s;t not deny me this re|que&s;t; for I &s;hall always want your per&s;on near me. Your coun&s;el and conduct will be a means to &s;trength|en the&s;e good principles, and laudable de&s;ires, that be|gin to bud forth in my heart.</P>
<P>And then turning to me he &s;aid, happy, thrice hap|py is my dear Polly! who was enabled to with&s;tand my anger, and to de&s;pi&s;e what then looked promi&s;ing, as to the things of this world; having her views wholly governed by virtue. You have at la&s;t, my dear child, e&s;caped all the &s;nares that were laid for you; and now your per&s;everance is crowned by an alliance with one
<PB N="70" REF="033734_0068_0FF8F166AB3C0610">
of the noble&s;t men this age can produce. May you &s;pend many happy days together; and, finally, may you be un&s;eparated in the world of joy and happine&s;s!</P>
<P>My dear uncle and aunt, you may well think this di&s;cour&s;e was plea&s;ing to me. How plea&s;ing indeed mu&s;t it be, to &s;ee my father's eyes gli&s;ten with rapture, and his looks full of noble &s;en&s;ibility; every word be|ing &s;poke with energy, and his countenance carrying a meaning in it, beyond the power of words to expre&s;s! My mother &s;eemed to indulge the anticipation of what might be the re&s;ult of this interview; tears of joy &s;ometimes e&s;caping her eyes, though &s;he &s;eemed to &s;trive again&s;t it. And, indeed, we all were more or le&s;s affected with the interview. But plea&s;ure &s;eemed to pervade all our minds, and brighten each one's coun|tenance.</P>
<P>In the evening, we were waited upon by &s;everal of the neighbouring gentry: and we &s;pent a very &s;ocial evening together. And, the next day, my father in|vited many of them, to dine with us, and welcome us into the&s;e parts again. Indeed, the company of &s;o many of my acquaintance, was very entertaining to me. They complimented us highly on our nuptials; and my father related to them what Mr. Danford had done for him. He &s;poke exceeding highly of him to the company; and would run on in his prai&s;e, though evidently again&s;t Mr. Danford's inclination. But he is &s;o plea&s;ing to my father, now, that he &s;ays, he mu&s;t &s;peak well of him in all company; and that he doth not think he will be lifted up by it; becau&s;e, &s;ays he&punc; Mr. Danford is above pride&punc; He al&s;o &s;poke very kindly to me, and &s;hewed me that tenderne&s;s before the company, as mu&s;t convince them, that he was fully re|conciled to me. He likewi&s;e took an occa&s;ion, to tell the whole circle how much he was delighted with me; and how glad he was, that I had made a virtu|ous man my early choice; and had been enabled to &s;tand again&s;t every temptation, and hard treatment, in order to &s;ecure to my&s;elf one that was as virtuous as I was.

proud in calling her companion, than I am in calling my &s;on. And as they have forgiven me, and all pa&s;t mi&s;under&s;tandings are to be buried in oblivion, I think there is a pro&s;pect of our being very happy together&mdash; which happine&s;s, it &s;hall be my endeavour to culti|vate.</P>
<P>The company &s;taid till quite late, and then retired, giving us a thou&s;and good wi&s;hes, and &s;eeming to par|ticipate in our happine&s;s.</P>
<P>Well, as the po&s;t was to &s;et out the next day, I hurried to get my &s;cribbles ready to &s;end forward to you. And now my dear uncle and aunt, am I not richly repaid for all the trials and troubles that I have met with? For I am now returned to a virtuous&punc; and religious father, who is no longer that &s;elfi&s;h world|ling he u&s;ed to be, but is a great advocate for virtue, and religious duties, which will not fail delighting one, who thinks well of the&s;e things. And then, to be received by my father with &s;uch open cordiality, to have his affections all flowing upon me again; and to &s;ee the &s;peaking joy of his countenance, every time we come into his pre&s;ence, is a matter of great joy and thankfulne&s;s with me.</P>
<P>As for the propo&s;al that my father made Mr. Dan|ford, of living with him, I cannot tell whether we &s;hall accept of it or not.</P>
<P>And now, my dear uncle and aunt, accept of my thanks, for the favours I have received from you, and of my be&s;t wi&s;hes, for your health and happine&s;s.&mdash; Plea&s;e to give my love to your family, and my compli|ments to all inquiring friends.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXV. From Mrs. <HI>POLLY DANFORD,</HI> to Mrs. FINTER.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Much honour'd, and greatly e&s;teemed Uncle and Aunt,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AGAIN write, agreeable to your reque&s;t, and &s;hall inform you of our further proceedings. My father continues to &s;how Mr. Danford every mark of di&s;tinction. Soon after I wrote you la&s;t, as we were all &s;etting together, my father directing him&s;elf to Mr. Danford, &s;aid, have you con&s;idered of the propo&s;al I made you, relative to our connecting our intere&s;t, and becoming but one in e&s;tate and family? Perhaps, Sir, &s;aid Mr. Danford, if I &s;hould join you, as you de&s;ire, it might give offence to Mr. Murfee and his wife, and I &s;hould be loath to do any thing, that might incur their di&s;plea&s;ure. And then I do not know whether it would be right for me to con&s;ider your e&s;tate as my own&mdash;would it, Sir?</P>
<P>Why truly, Mr. Danford, &s;aid my father, neither Murfee nor Jenny can expect I &s;hould do much for them. For when I applied to him in my difficulty, he turned a deaf ear to my complaint, although I ex|po&s;tulated with him, and told him it would not be for the credit of the family, to let the e&s;tate go into the hands of a &s;tranger; yet he treated me with in&s;ult and contempt. I then made him the offer I now make you; but he refu&s;ed, and treated me with abu&s;ive language, which rai&s;ed my di&s;plea&s;ure and indignation again&s;t him, and all tho&s;e who &s;quare all their doings by a view of &s;elf-intere&s;t, and are making an idol of them&s;elves. But it had this effect on me, that it cau&s;|ed me to think there mu&s;t be &s;omething in religion be|&s;ides a mere form; and that brought me into a cour&s;e
<PB N="73" REF="033734_0071_0FF8F16CCAE765A8">
of thinking, which has terminated in the full belief of the reality and importance of a religious cour&s;e of life, which I hope I practice in &s;ome mea&s;ure. And now I want your a&s;&s;i&s;tance in my worldly affairs, and your advice and example in the matters of a &s;piritual nature. And as to what you &s;aid, concerning Mr. Murfee and Jenny, I &s;hall &s;ubmit the matter to your judgment, to do as you &s;hall think ju&s;t and right; for I would not wi&s;h to do him wrong, though he has di&s;plea&s;ed me. But you mu&s;t not deny me the reque&s;t I have made. Mr. Danford in reply &s;aid, if you will do this, Sir, I will come into the mea&s;ure you propo&s;ed, viz. let your e&s;tate be valued, and a ju&s;t inventory taken, of all the e&s;tate you was in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of, at the time I came to your hou&s;e; and let it &s;tand in a fair manner, to be &s;een hereafter, and then I will join my e&s;tate with your's, and we will carry on but one intere&s;t.</P>
<P>At this my father &s;aid he would fully acquie&s;ce; and would &s;et about the bu&s;ine&s;s as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible. And now, continued he, I can &s;ee the preference of virtue to any thing el&s;e; for when you could have made my whole e&s;tate your own, you refu&s;ed it from a regard of ju&s;tice. But what &s;hall I &s;ay to you, my dear &s;on and daughter? You will doubtle&s;s be ble&s;&s;ed in this world, and that which is to come&punc; and you will be a ble&s;&s;ing to me, lightening my burden, and cau&s;ing me to &s;pend the remainder of my days in quiet and happine&s;s.</P>
<P>Well, my dear uncle and aunt, we have got all the&s;e matters &s;ettled, and we now live in one hou&s;e, and have but one intere&s;t. And indeed their &s;tock in trade is very large, which enables them to carry it on to great advantage. We live exceeding happy together, for my father is very fond of Mr. Danford; and Mr. Danford is careful to a&s;k advice of him, in every un|dertaking of any importance. And &s;o you &s;ee we are as happy as one could think of being in this world of uncertainty, change and trouble. My dear uncle and aunt, don't you think that many of the troubles we labour under ari&s;e from our&s;elves? and that we bring them on us by our own mi&s;conduct? I am led to think
<PB N="74" REF="033734_0072_0FF8BFB8F616C188">
that is many times the ca&s;e. For oftentimes we get unea&s;y in our minds, and murmur at all we meet with; and we often fault others, when, at the &s;ame time, our troubles ari&s;e from our own ba&s;ene&s;s of heart: for our unruly hearts will run into faulty mea&s;ures, if we don't keep a &s;trict watch over them, and then we &s;hall be led to wrong our fellow-creatures, which will procure us many enemies, and tho&s;e enemies will try to be reveng|ed on us; which will lead us into many entanglements and troubles; when, at the &s;ame time, if we would only trace the matter to its &s;ource, we &s;hould find it would terminate in our own hearts.</P>
<P>But with our family, every affair is conducted by the rule of &s;trict ju&s;tice, which gains us many friends.</P>
<P>And now, my dear aunt, as we have got into a reg|ular way of living, you mu&s;t expect no more adventures from me: and yet, perhaps, I may write you &s;ome ac|count of our vi&s;its; for we are going to pay Mrs. Granbe one &s;oon.</P>
<P>With my be&s;t re&s;pects to you, and compliments to all my friends, I ha&s;ten to &s;ub&s;cribe my&s;elf yours, &amp;c.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXVI. From Mrs. <HI>POLLY DANFORD,</HI> to her Aunt FINTER.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Ever dear Aunt,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AGAIN a&s;&s;ume my pen, as I have engag|ed to write you every thing that is worth notice. Since I wrote to you la&s;t, I have made &s;everal vi&s;its; and there are &s;ome particulars in our conver&s;ations, that I wi&s;h to let you into. In the fir&s;t place, we paid a vi&s;it to my dear Mrs. Sophia Granbe; and re|ally Mr. Granbe is a delightful man, indeed he is!
<PB N="75" REF="033734_0073_0FF8F17212DB9F18">
Well, I will give you the particulars of our tour. As we went in the coach, he and I had a con&s;iderable con|ver&s;ation together; in which he was plea&s;ed to remind me of &s;everal things that he wi&s;hed to have ob&s;erved in his family. And his di&s;cour&s;e was delivered with &s;uch love, and tenderne&s;s, that I am &s;ure it was very plea&s;|ing to me. And indeed he ever treats me with that tenderne&s;s which denotes the noble mind, and gener|ous heart. This fully &s;ecures me in his honour, and leaves me no room to di&s;tru&s;t his love or fidelity.</P>
<P>Well, the fir&s;t thing that he mentioned to me was, that whenever he &s;hould invite a friend home with him, or have one call upon him, he wi&s;hed to have &s;uch an one received with every mark of polite atten|tion. Let your bu&s;ine&s;s, &s;aid he, be what it will, or the per&s;on ever &s;o obnoxious to you, yet I &s;hall expect that you will not receive &s;uch with indifference. For a woman, continued he, to &s;how by her countenance, words or behaviour, that the per&s;on &s;o invited is not welcome, gives the per&s;on a very di&s;agreeable feeling, and at the &s;ame time reflects di&s;honour on the man. And the man, you know, cannot be di&s;honoured with|out his companion's participating in the &s;ame di&s;hon|our. For often, my dear, have I been at hou&s;es, where the wife's conduct plainly &s;hewed that I was not want|ed; when, at the &s;ame time, the gentleman of the hou&s;e was urgent for me to call upon him. And once in particular I will mention: Falling in company one evening with a gentleman, we &s;oon got acquainted, and he very urgently in&s;i&s;ted upon my going home, and &s;pending the night with him. I being at a di&s;tance from home, after a little he&s;itation, accepted his invi|tation. But when we arrived at his hou&s;e, his wife behaved quite odly; for &s;he never ro&s;e from her &s;eat, but fixed her eyes on the fire; and after the fir&s;t volley at her companion, was quite dumb. He &s;et me a chair, and I &s;eated my&s;elf. He then ordered &s;ome refre&s;h|ment, but in vain. He then addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to me, and &s;aid, it is but a few &s;teps, Sir, to an hou&s;e of en|tertainment. Upon this, I bid him good by, and with|drew. How the man felt, you may judge; for I mu&s;t
<PB N="76" REF="033734_0074_0FF8F174E8BB2B78">
confe&s;s it gave me a di&s;agreeable feeling. Indeed, the man and woman were both to blame. He, for not in&s;tructing her better; and &s;he, for in&s;ulting him to &s;uch a degree. Such behaviour reflects di&s;grace on any family. The wife ought ever to receive her hu&s;|band's acquaintance with an open and cheerful coun|tenance; and u&s;e &s;uch an one with all the politene&s;s &s;he is capable of. Becau&s;e, if &s;he re&s;pects her hu&s;|band, &s;he mu&s;t, and will re&s;pect his friends. At lea&s;t, that is the rule which we generally judge by.</P>
<P>I don't think, my dear, &s;aid he, you are capable of &s;uch an enormity; yet I wanted to expre&s;s my mind to you on this &s;ubject. And there are &s;everal other things that I want ju&s;t to mention. One is, that I &s;hould wi&s;h to have you always dre&s;&s;ed, and the hou&s;e put in order, early in the day; then company would never find you unprepared to receive them. For, at many places, when one calls in to &s;ee a friend, they are wholly unprepared to receive one; and then there is &s;uch a running, and dre&s;&s;ing, and &s;lutter in the whole family, that it takes off all the plea&s;ure of conver&s;a|tion; and one wi&s;hes them&s;elves at home again. And as to the hour of retiring to re&s;t at night, and ari&s;ing in the morning; I &s;hould chu&s;e to go to re&s;t at ten, and ri&s;e early in the morning. But perhaps you will &s;ay, that this is quite unfa&s;hionable; and how will com|pany join with us in this unpolite practice? I an&s;wer, that in my opinion, 'tis in the power of every man to pre&s;cribe rules for his own family, and adhere to tho&s;e rules without giving offence. And I &s;hall make it my practice, always, to withdraw from company, and re|turn to my hou&s;e, at nine in the evening; and when others &s;ee that this is my practice, they will do the &s;ame when they are at my hou&s;e. And thus we &s;hall have &s;ome time for contemplation. For you know, my dear, that the better part ought not to be neglected, out of mere fa&s;hionablene&s;s. And then, again, if we ari&s;e early, we may call our family to orders, and not be di&s;turbed by company. And now, my dear, I hope you will take this di&s;cour&s;e kindly. Indeed I have not a &s;ingle thought, but that the&s;e things are agreea|ble
<PB N="77" REF="033734_0075_0FF8BFBAA18A8C40">
to you; yet I thought it was nece&s;&s;ary, that I &s;hould expre&s;s my mind to you on the&s;e &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>Dear Sir, &s;aid I, your di&s;cour&s;e is very agreeable, and I am glad you have opened your mind to me on tho&s;e &s;ubjects; and I wi&s;h you would often notice to me tho&s;e rules that are nece&s;&s;ary for me to follow. And now, Sir, I wi&s;h to a&s;k you a que&s;tion or two, wanting to have your opinion on the &s;ubject. The fir&s;t que&s;tion is, how &s;hould a man and woman behave to each other, in company, after they are married? For I have often &s;een tho&s;e that are married u&s;e each other with great freedoms; and &s;eem as if they could not &s;ay too much to the expen&s;e of each other; which ever looked ridiculous to me; and often made me think, it was be&s;t for one not to change their condition, if one could not do it without having all their fooli&s;h foibles expo&s;ed to the world. For you know, Sir, there are many things which we do, and &s;ay, which we don't wi&s;h to have exhibited to public view. And the other que&s;tion is, how is it po&s;&s;ible that any man &s;hould be &s;o abandoned, as to attempt the cha&s;tity of any of our &s;ex that are within the pale, with|out &s;ome encouragement from the per&s;on &s;o attempted?</P>
<P>As to the fir&s;t que&s;tion, my dear, I think the beha|viour of tho&s;e who are &s;o nearly connected, when in company, ought to be &s;uch, as would induce the com|pany to judge, that they were agreeable to each other. And when they di&s;cour&s;e with each other, it ought to be done with tenderne&s;s, and in as polite a manner, as you would addre&s;s any other per&s;on: but nothing bor|dering on an over-heated fondne&s;s; for a per&s;on can &s;peak kind and agreeable things to another; and &s;how that their companion has the preference, and that one is no ways di&s;&s;atisfied with their choice, without that fawning fondne&s;s that is ever di&s;gu&s;tful to compa|ny, and is to be reprobated by all by-&s;tanders: But, as you ob&s;erved, there are tho&s;e, who &s;peak &s;hocking things of their companions only to divert them&s;elves and company, not con&s;idering that the re&s;t of the com|pany will think them&s;elves authori&s;ed to u&s;e the &s;ame freedoms. And again, they will many times expo&s;e
<PB N="78" REF="033734_0076_0FF8F17B119F46B8">
the foibles of each other, which &s;hould be the care and endeavour of every thinking per&s;on to conceal. By which means they are expo&s;ed to the contempt and &s;corn of all that come near them. And how can it otherways be, when tho&s;e that ought to extenuate the faults of each other, &s;eem to try all in their power to exaggerate them, and to make their bo&s;om friend look as ridiculous as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>As to your other que&s;tion, I do not think there are many men that will attempt the cha&s;tity of a married woman, unle&s;s &s;he, by &s;ome word or action, gives him encouragement. And the greate&s;t thing that one can po&s;&s;ibly improve upon, is the woman's &s;peaking &s;light|ingly of her hu&s;band; which the man &s;o attempting, will immediately take advantage of, by joining with her again&s;t her hu&s;band, and will &s;oon make him appear to her a &s;hocking picture of a man; and &s;o will lead on, from one thing to another, 'till he has in&s;inu|ated him&s;elf into her favour, which many times will end in ruin. We ought therefore to &s;peak well of our companion before all company, that none may take advantage of our conver&s;ation. Great freedoms in conver&s;ation often emboldens the vicious to con&s;true &s;uch freedoms as an encouragement. Therefore I think it be&s;t to be mode&s;t in our conver&s;ation; for that will tend to our own honour, as well as &s;atisfac|tion. And now, my dear, I have given you my thoughts on the&s;e &s;ubjects, without the lea&s;t re&s;erve.</P>
<P>It is very kind in you, Sir, &s;aid I, and very &s;atis|factory to me, for you to di&s;cour&s;e on the&s;e topics.&mdash; And do, dear Sir, continue to in&s;truct me, as occa&s;ion &s;hall offer.</P>
<P>And &s;o my dear aunt, we held our di&s;cour&s;e, till we arrived at Mr. Granbe's. When we arrived there, we were met at the door by Mr. Granbe, who conducted us into the parlour, where we were met by my dear Mrs. Sophia, who run to me, and we could not refrain from embracing each other. You may ea&s;ily imagine the meeting was very agreeable to us; for we had not &s;een each other for the &s;pace of two years. After the fir&s;t emotion was over, we &s;eated
<PB N="79" REF="033734_0077_0FF8F17E129C53F8">
our&s;elves, and entered into conver&s;ation; and there was &s;uch cheerfulne&s;s in each one's countenance, ac|companied with &s;uch frankne&s;s of behaviour, and the conver&s;ation was conducted with &s;uch politene&s;s and ea&s;e, as made the interview very plea&s;ing to each one of us; and we &s;pent the remainder of the day and evening, greatly to my &s;atisfaction. For, as Mr. Dan|ford and Mr. Granbe are both of a &s;erious turn of mind, their di&s;cour&s;e was beautified with &s;ome noble remarks on religion. My dear Mrs. Granbe thinks exceeding well of religion, &s;o that their di&s;cour&s;e was truly &s;atisfactory to both of us. I cannot forbear mentioning one remark that Mr. Granbe made on what I think is a great duty.</P>
<P>It appeared &s;trange to him, he &s;aid, that &s;o many in this land, where we are favoured with a preached go&s;pel, &s;hould de&s;ignedly ab&s;ent them&s;elves from pub|lic wor&s;hip, and debar them&s;elves from the benefit of the word of God; and, as it were, &s;hut the door again&s;t all conviction; and thereby, in effect, &s;ay, "they care for none of the&s;e things." And thus, through this fatal neglect, the morals of tho&s;e unhappy per&s;ons become corrupted, and they grow more and more vic|ious, until, perhaps, they grow quite abandoned, and are pa&s;t all hopes of repentance. But the evil will not &s;top here; for his children will be apt to follow his example, and &s;o it will be like a great river of death, that flows broader and deeper, till it ends in de&s;truc|tion. And I verily believe, continued he, that it would be to a man's advantage to attend con&s;tantly on public wor&s;hip, if it were only to cultivate the morals of his children. And what, continued he, can be the rea&s;on, that &s;o many in the&s;e days, are &s;o much ad|dicted to profane language? Can there be any plea&s;|ure in the u&s;e of &s;uch language, or any &s;atisfaction to be reaped therefrom? To me it is quite di&s;gu&s;tful; and I cannot &s;ee what can induce any one to utter &s;uch di&s;cour&s;e&punc; and I would thank you Mr. Danford, continued he, to give us your mind on this &s;ubject.</P>
<P>I &s;hall be happy, &s;aid Mr. Danford, to oblige you, by delivering my &s;entiments on that &s;ubject: for I
<PB N="80" REF="033734_0078_0FF8F180E40D56F0">
think it is a mo&s;t dete&s;table practice. For in almo&s;t all other enormities that we run into, there &s;eems to be &s;ome temptation to excite us thereunto: but profane language is a vice which &s;eems to be without the lea&s;t temptation. For it does not promi&s;e either plea&s;ure, profit, or honour: but ever makes tho&s;e who u&s;e it, look contemptible! Indeed, it is quite a fooli&s;h prac|tice, and unmans any per&s;on who makes u&s;e of it.&mdash; I cannot imagine what inducement any per&s;on can have, for addicting them&s;elves to &s;uch infernal language. But, perhaps, &s;ome may think, that wounding the ears of many with their profane words, will grace their con|ver&s;ation in the opinion of others, and &s;et them off in the eyes of the world, cau&s;ing others to think they are full as important as they really are. But with good characters, they mu&s;t, and will appear very little, and their words of no con&s;equence; becau&s;e tho&s;e that will &s;wear needle&s;sly, will, generally, as needle&s;sly wrong the truth. And I make it a rule, to give but little credit to what &s;uch per&s;ons &s;ay: for a per&s;on that will lie, will &s;wear to it, without the lea&s;t he&s;ita|tion. Therefore, &s;uch per&s;ons are not to be believed a whit the more for their horrible a&s;&s;everations. I have often wondered, that any per&s;on can be &s;o aband|oned, as to imitate the father of lies, and prince of darkne&s;s, and u&s;e language which we &s;uppo&s;e is agreea|ble to his language, only for the &s;ake of following a fooli&s;h practice, which, the mo&s;t abandoned among&s;t us, have brought into vogue, by the in&s;tigation of the above agent. Some are &s;o vicious and void of good man|ners, that they do not &s;cruple to wound, with their hor|rid expre&s;&s;ions, the ears and tender feelings of the fair &s;ex, who, we mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e, abhor to hear &s;uch lan|guage made u&s;e of: for we cannot harbour a thought that &s;uch di&s;cour&s;e is agreeable to them, much le&s;s, that any of that &s;ex will make u&s;e of it.</P>
<P>The next day, as we were in conver&s;ation, Mr. Granbe de&s;ired me to give them the hi&s;tory of my &s;uf|ferings, which I accordingly did, with cheerfulne&s;s, and much to his &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="033734_0079_0FF8BFC153C02ED0">He then a&s;ked me to give my opinion upon the&s;e que&s;tions, viz. How far ought a parent to &s;how re&s;ent|ment to their children, when they attempt to marry contrary to their liking? And, al&s;o, whether parents ought to u&s;e commands in that affair, or not. I have been, perhaps, Sir, &s;aid I, too much in the &s;moke, to give you a clear and impartial account of the fire; and would beg you, Sir, to put that que&s;tion to Mr. Dan|ford. And then turning to Mr. Danford, &s;aid, will you, my dear, give Mr. Granbe an an&s;wer to this que&s;tion?</P>
<P>If you reque&s;t it, &s;aid Mr. Danford, I &s;hall be hap|py to give Mr. Granbe, and the re&s;t of the company, my thoughts on that &s;ubject. The re&s;t of the company &s;aid, it would be very &s;atisfactory to them, to hear his mind on it.</P>
<P>I will proceed, then, &s;aid Mr. Danford, by declar|ing, that, in my opinion, parents ought never to com|mand their children, in point of marriage, again&s;t their inclination; nor u&s;e any roughne&s;s in the matter. But if parents &s;ee that a child, in their opinion, is in dan|ger of being ruined in marriage, they ought, by all means, to give them their advice, and tell them of the fatal con&s;equences of their proceedings. But their ad|vice ought to be given, mixed with love, and the ten|dere&s;t expre&s;&s;ions they are capable of. For, how doth a parent know, but the child's inclination is too &s;trong|ly bia&s;&s;ed to admit of an alteration. The&s;e are very tender points to meddle with; and the parent, by com|manding the child again&s;t its liking, may &s;hock the feelings, change the temper, and even di&s;order the &s;en|&s;es of the child. For commands are very &s;tubborn things, and ought not to be u&s;ed at all in this matter. And it is my opinion, that advice will go further to|wards making a child break with a per&s;on they are attached to, than rough u&s;age: for a dutiful child will have a regard to the tender advice of an affection|ate parent; and if their inclinations are not too &s;trong|ly fixed, will certainly adhere to &s;uch advice, for it will then appear to be wholly de&s;igned for their good. But when any kind of roughne&s;s is u&s;ed, the child will
<PB N="82" REF="033734_0080_0FF8F186852D8020">
be apt to &s;ay, what! am I not capable of making my own choice? and why may I not have one of my own chu&s;ing, in&s;tead of being compelled to be joined to one who I cannot like? And then, what has the per&s;on that I have &s;et my affections on done, that he mu&s;t be &s;lighted and abu&s;ed? I am &s;ure he is not to blame, that I am partial in his favour: and as long as I have a regard for him, it is kind in him to regard me. And I think it very unju&s;t, that he &s;hould be per&s;ecuted only becau&s;e he is agreeable to me. And thus the parents, by their rough treatment to their child, will arou&s;e the &s;entiments of compa&s;&s;ion and gratitude in favour of the per&s;on beloved, which will have a tendency to heighten their affections for each other.&mdash; "Stolen waters are &s;weet;" and &s;ome have gone &s;o far as to &s;uppo&s;e, that our fir&s;t parents would not have preferred the forbidden fruit, if there had been no prohibition on it. How very irk&s;ome it is to be con|fined to the company of this, that, or any other per&s;on, again&s;t our wills and inclination? And to be confined to a per&s;on that is not agreeable to us, and that confinement to be for life, in the neare&s;t relation that can po&s;&s;ibly &s;ub&s;i&s;t, is a very unhappy &s;ituation; and ought to engro&s;s the mo&s;t &s;erious con&s;ideration of parents as well as children.</P>
<P>Your &s;entiments, &s;aid Mr. Granbe, are exactly agree|able to my mind. For, I think, that parents, in &s;uch ca&s;es, ought to do nothing but give their advice; and then let their children do as they plea&s;e. For 'tis they that mu&s;t abide the con&s;equence, and not the parents. And when they have given their advice, told the child what they think will be the con&s;equences of their pro|ceedings, and mentioned the particular failing of the per&s;ons they are advi&s;ing again&s;t, I think they have done their duty; and &s;hould &s;uffer the child to con&s;ider of the matter, and refu&s;e, or accept the advice, as they think fit. When parents u&s;e their power and author|ity in this point, it often has a contrary effect, from what they de&s;igned; and is &s;carcely ever productive of good; but many times will end in the di&s;appoint|ment of them, and damage of the child; and &s;ometimes the con&s;equences prove fatal.</P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="033734_0081_0FF8F18A07FD3E08">By this, my dear aunt, you may judge, that our vi&s;it was very entertaining. And, as I have given you &s;uch a lengthy account of our conver&s;ation, I &s;hall &s;ay no more about this vi&s;it.</P>
<P>But I would &s;ay one word about my father's con|duct, &s;ince our return to his hou&s;e. Indeed, my dear aunt, he is one of the mo&s;t exemplary men in the&s;e parts; for he is very exact in all the duties of relig|ion, and makes a virtuous life his aim and boa&s;t. He is exceeding fond of Mr. Danford, and is very lavi&s;h in the prai&s;es of him, and his daughter Polly (as he always calls me) to all his acquaintances. And is often telling his friends, what Mr. Danford has done for him; and then condemns him&s;elf, for his conduct to us heretofore. But &s;ays, as we have forgiven him, he hopes to gain our affections entirely by his conduct to us; and that his endeavours &s;hall not be wanting. But my papa need not be anxious on that &s;core; for, I am &s;ure, he has our love, and re&s;pect, and will ever have our be&s;t wi&s;hes. I feel my&s;elf entirely ea&s;y; and as contented as is po&s;&s;ible for one to be in this world.</P>
<P>Well, if I don't conclude, you will think I am going to write a packet, in&s;tead of a letter. Plea&s;e to give my compliments to all friends; and love to your fam|ily. Dear aunt, a&s;&s;ure your&s;elf that I am your mo&s;t affectionate niece,</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXVII. From Mrs. <HI>POLLY DANFORD,</HI> to her Aunt <HI>FINTER.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Ever dear Aunt,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I WILL &s;end you another letter. But per|haps I &s;hall tre&s;pa&s;s on your patience. Yet, as it is to my &s;econd mamma; and, as you &s;ay, you love to read my &s;cribbles, I will write on without further apology.
<PB N="84" REF="033734_0082_0FF8BFC2DDF41F10">
Well, this letter &s;hall give you &s;ome account of Mr. Stapleton and his lady; for we have paid him a vi&s;it. Mr. Danford, who had been out, the other day, inform|ed me, that he had been in company with Mr. Staple|ton, who had invited us to pay him a vi&s;it. Have you, my dear, &s;aid he to me, any inclination to accept of his invitation?</P>
<P>If it is agreeable to you, Sir, &s;aid I, I have no ob|jections; and &s;hall attend to your command at any time.</P>
<P>He wi&s;hed to wait upon us, to-morrow, replied Mr. Danford, and I think we will go; for I have &s;ome inclination my&s;elf to &s;ee his lady; and, perhaps, it will be &s;atisfactory to you to &s;pend an hour or two with her. And I &s;uppo&s;e you can di&s;cour&s;e with him now with more ea&s;e, than you could, when he u&s;ed to vi&s;it you.</P>
<P>I don't know but I can, &s;aid I. And, be&s;ides, I promi&s;ed him that I would re&s;pect him as my father's friend, if he would relinqui&s;h his preten&s;ions to me: and now if I pay him a vi&s;it, I &s;hall be as good as my word.</P>
<P>Well, about ten o'clock the next day, we &s;et out on our vi&s;it; and as it is &s;ome di&s;tance to Mr. Stapleton's, we went in the coach.</P>
<P>On our way thither, Mr. Danford told me, that we mu&s;t not expect to &s;ee &s;o polite a family as &s;ome; but, continued he, we mu&s;t not let that di&s;concert us; on the contrary let our behaviour be as ea&s;y, and our con|ver&s;ation as cheerful, as if we were well plea&s;ed with their conduct.</P>
<P>I hope, Sir, &s;aid I, that I &s;hall not be &s;o ab&s;urd as to trouble my&s;elf about their family oeconomy. Nev|erthele&s;s, I am glad you mentioned it to me; for now, I &s;hall keep it in mind, and, therefore, &s;hall not be &s;o likely to &s;how any &s;urpri&s;e at their roughne&s;s. I have &s;een Mrs. Stapleton when &s;he was a maiden, and &s;he then appeared to be quite an odd per&s;on in her beha|viour. Therefore mu&s;t not expect to find any thing genteel or polite in them. Well, at length we arrived at their hou&s;e and Mr. Danford knocked at the door.
<PB N="85" REF="033734_0083_0FF8F190B887BDA0">
Come in, &s;aid Mrs. Stapleton; but did not come to the door. So in we bolted; and as the parlour door was open, we &s;tept in; where Mrs. Stapleton was &s;itting. She, without ri&s;ing to receive us, cried out, lard! here is Mr. Danford come!</P>
<P>Mr. Danford then took my hand, and introduced me to her.</P>
<P>Your &s;ervant, ma'am! &s;aid &s;he; but you have catch|ed me in my morning dre&s;s.</P>
<P>We then &s;eated our&s;elves, without any further com|pliments. Is Mr. Stapleton at home, ma'am? &s;aid Mr. Danford.</P>
<P>No, &s;aid &s;he, he is taking his morning ramble, I &s;uppo&s;e. Why, Mr. Danford, the&s;e men are &s;trange creatures, when they once get married. And I &s;up|po&s;e they are all alike, ha, ha, ha!</P>
<P>He is doubtle&s;s on bu&s;ine&s;s, &s;aid Mr. Danford: but you expect him &s;oon, don't you, madam?</P>
<P>Yes, Sir, &s;aid &s;he. But I believe 'tis time I was dre&s;&s;ed, and the room &s;et in order. With that, &s;he got up for the fir&s;t time, and went to the door, calling out, Nab! you jade! why don't you &s;et this room in order? Becau&s;e, ma'am, &s;aid &s;he, you did not or|der me to do it. Come along, &s;aid &s;he, and do as I bid you! And then away &s;he went up &s;tairs to dre&s;s, and left us &s;itting in the parlour alone.</P>
<P>After a while Nab, as Mrs. Stapleton called her, came in; but &s;eemed to be very unea&s;y at what her mi&s;tre&s;s had &s;aid to her. For &s;he &s;aid, the time &s;he had engaged to live with Mr. Stapleton was almo&s;t out, after which, &s;he would not live with them one hour. For, &s;aid &s;he, when one does all in one's power to plea&s;e; to have nothing but angry words for their pains, is very di&s;couraging. And this very morning I offered to &s;et this room in order, but &s;he would not let me; and now I mu&s;t be called a jade, for not doing what &s;he would not allow me to do: and all this only to make me look ill before &s;trangers. I am not u&s;ed to &s;uch treatment; for I was never faulted in any fam|ily before, neither will I be faulted in this much longer.</P>
<P><PB N="86" REF="033734_0084_0FF8F19313972EB8">After &s;he had put the room in order, &s;he went out; and though I did not care to make her any reply, yet Mr. Danford and I had a con&s;iderable di&s;cour&s;e on the &s;ubject. For we were left alone, and could di&s;|cour&s;e as privily as if we were in our own chamber.</P>
<P>What means do you think, my dear, &s;aid he to me, are the be&s;t, to prevent the&s;e family feuds, which are &s;o very trouble&s;ome, where they are practiced?</P>
<P>I think, Sir, &s;aid I, that a family may be governed as well without &s;uch a clamour, as with it. And for the mo&s;t part, a kind word, and a plea&s;ant look will do more towards keeping up good order in a family, than hard words and angry looks. And then, for the head of a family to command, and then countermand their &s;ervants, and blame them for not doing what, perhaps, they never commanded them to do, is di&s;couraging, and cannot fail of di&s;agreeable con&s;equences. And then, when there is a continual clamour kept up, the &s;ervants don't know when one is in earne&s;t, and when not; and &s;o, by this means, one lo&s;es all their author|ity with their &s;ervants, and cannot expect any thing but feuds, and di&s;turbances in their family.</P>
<P>After a while, Mr. Stapleton came home, and put on as graceful a face as po&s;&s;ible, and was as polite as you ever &s;aw him. When he entered the parlour where we were &s;itting, he paid his compliments to Mr. Dan|ford, and then to me; which, being returned, and we having &s;eated our&s;elves, he &s;aid, it gives me great &s;at|isfaction, to &s;ee two of my mo&s;t worthy friends call upon me; and I am &s;orry that I was not at home when you fir&s;t came; but I was called away on bu&s;ine&s;s, and hope I may be excu&s;ed.</P>
<P>You are very excu&s;able, &s;aid Mr. Danford, for it is often the ca&s;e, that we are called from home, when we lea&s;t wi&s;h to be ab&s;ent.</P>
<P>Now, in this place, my dear aunt, I will try to give you &s;ome &s;ort of a portrait of Mrs. Stapleton, and a &s;ketch of her character. She is of a dark complexion, with coar&s;e black hair, and black eyes; which, at the fir&s;t &s;ight, &s;how a degree of brilliance; but it needs but
<PB N="87" REF="033734_0085_0FF8F195EF9A66C0">
a &s;mall degree of phy&s;iognomy, to di&s;cover, that they are filled with malignant &s;pite. She is full faced, and all her features rather coar&s;e; and being pretty tall and bulky, one would be led to think, that none could like her for her per&s;on. Well, now for her character. She is of a ludicrous turn of mind, and affects to be a wit; which leads her to be very loquacious; though for the mo&s;t part, her prattle is without connexion or &s;en&s;e. And this &s;he generally makes more contemptible, by letting up a large laugh at the end of every &s;entence, which I think indicates brutality of manners. She is of a dictatorial temper, and therefore cannot bear to be contradicted; which makes it very difficult for one to di&s;cour&s;e with her, without offence; and indeed, I did not care to have much conver&s;ation with her.</P>
<P>But to return; after a while Mrs. Stapleton came down &s;tairs, dre&s;&s;ed out to the be&s;t advantage; and &s;eemed to be full of a &s;en&s;e of her own importance. After &s;eating her&s;elf, &s;he &s;aid to Mr. Stapleton, I think you received your gue&s;ts in a &s;hocking manner this morning; for you told me, that you expected Mr. Dan|ford and his lady here, and then run away your&s;elf; &s;o as to be out of the way when they came.</P>
<P>But bu&s;ine&s;s called me away, ma'am, &s;aid he; and I was &s;orry for it: but I think you might have been dre&s;&s;ed before twelve, and not have left Mr. and Mrs. Danford &s;itting here alone; which was very unpolite in you. And I had rather you &s;hould not have been dre&s;&s;ed to-day, than to have treated my friends in &s;uch a manner. Perhaps, &s;aid Mrs, Stapleton, you have been at the tavern, this morning; for I am &s;ure, that you have come home much more nice, than you was when you went away. And what if Mr. Danford did find me in my morning dre&s;s? Do you think it was the fir&s;t time he ever &s;aw a woman in a morning habit? I don't &s;uppo&s;e that Mr. Danford is quite &s;o nice as you are. But I believe, the&s;e men, the be&s;t of them, love to fault their wives, yet we can, for the mo&s;t part, be up &s;ides with you&punc; and &s;o there you have it! ha, ha, ha!</P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="033734_0086_0FF8F19DDFC9AA30">And &s;o, my dear aunt, they &s;ported with each oth|er's characters, 'till they had expo&s;ed all their foibles. I believe you may well think this was but a dull en|tertainment to us. But to return.</P>
<P>My dear, &s;aid Mr. Stapleton, I believe 'tis time to drop this di&s;cour&s;e. Perhaps it is not agreeable to Mr. Danford and his lady.</P>
<P>Well, &s;aid &s;he, if they can't join with us, I &s;uppo&s;e they can &s;et and hear us. With that &s;he &s;et up a hor&s;e laugh again. After this, the conver&s;ation became general, and we di&s;cour&s;ed on common topics till din|ner.</P>
<P>After dinner, upon Mr. Stapleton and his wife's falling into the &s;ame thwarting, reproachful di&s;cour&s;e, Mr. Stapleton, addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to Mr. Danford, &s;aid, don't you and your lady never get into the&s;e fool|i&s;h di&s;putes? Although I cannot approve of &s;uch di&s;|cour&s;e, yet I think Mrs. Stapleton and I are always at them.</P>
<P>Neither can I approve of &s;uch di&s;cour&s;e, &s;aid Mr. Danford; for I think it is a very di&s;agreeable &s;ight, to &s;ee the two that are, or ought to be, but one, contin|ually at variance; even though it is in a je&s;ting way. And many times they begin in je&s;t, and end in earne&s;t. Ah, &s;aid Mr. Stapleton, that is often the ca&s;e with Mrs. Stapleton and my&s;elf; for we often get by the ears; and after a little &s;marting on both &s;ides, we come to an ecclairci&s;&s;ement, and then we jog on in the &s;ame path we did before.</P>
<P>Well, &s;aid Mrs. Stapleton, I don't care a fig about your refinements: neither do I like &s;uch mighty polite|ne&s;s between a man and his wife. I love je&s;ting; and if we do di&s;agree at times, what then? After we have had a &s;mart quarrel, we can have a &s;weet making up; and then we love one another better than ever. And &s;o I don't care whether either of you like it or not, as it is plea&s;ing to me. I &s;uppo&s;e I have a right to chu&s;e my di&s;cour&s;e. What &s;ay you, Mrs. Danford, won't you join with us in this matter?</P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="033734_0087_0FF8BFC58B5FBE40">I mu&s;t beg leave to differ from you, ma'am, &s;aid I, for I always look upon a man and his wife, to be but one. And I think there ought not to be any differ|ence &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between them, on any account what&s;o|ever. And then, a woman ought ever to look upon her hu&s;band as the head, and one that has a right to command; and &s;he ought to reverence him according|ly. At this, Mrs. Stapleton broke in upon me, &s;aying, "Reverence to whom reverence is due;" but I think my&s;elf as much above the men, as you think your&s;elf below them. And, "as one thinketh, &s;o is he." And &s;o there I have you, ha, ha, ha!</P>
<P>And now, dear aunt, did you ever hear any thing like this? To turn every thing one &s;ays into ridicule in this manner? Indeed it quite provoked me, &s;o I did not an&s;wer her again.</P>
<P>After this we di&s;cour&s;ed on common topics till it was time to return home. And glad was I, when we got into the coach again. After we had got a little from the hou&s;e, Mr. Danford &s;aid to me, well, my dear, how did you like your vi&s;it? Did you get any in&s;truction from Mr. and Mrs. Stapleton's di&s;cour&s;e? For we ought ever to improve by the conduct of oth|ers. It was not &s;atisfactory to me in the lea&s;t, &s;aid I. On the contrary, their je&s;ting, di&s;puting, and expo&s;ing one another, appeared to me ridiculous, and di&s;gu&s;tful, in the highe&s;t degree. But then, as to my improving by their conduct, I think I never made a vi&s;it in my life that I might get more in&s;truction from, than this: for what we &s;ee thus &s;trikingly ami&s;s in others, we &s;hall be more apt to avoid our&s;elves, and thus e&s;cape the rock they &s;plit upon. May I never be left to conduct in a family as Mrs. Stapleton does! But what do you think of their conduct, Sir?</P>
<P>I agree with you in &s;entiments, upon that &s;ubject, &s;aid he, but it is granted by all, that a man and his wife may u&s;e freedom of &s;peech to each other, when alone: But you know that I always made it a point with me, when in company, to u&s;e you with as much politene&s;s, as I did any in the circle: and this I think
<PB N="90" REF="033734_0088_0FF8F19F8312A6D0">
ought always to be ob&s;erved as a rule by married peo|ple. But Mr. and Mrs. Stapleton bid fair to wear out a wretched life together, without peace or con|tentment of mind; while, at the &s;ame time, their be|ing in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a con&s;iderable e&s;tate, &s;eems on|ly to heighten their di&s;content and mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>You &s;ee, my dear, by what Mrs. Stapleton &s;aid to you about the reverence due to hu&s;bands, that Mr. Stapleton has lo&s;t all authority in his family, and that his wife places but little confidence in him; and when that is the ca&s;e, you cannot expect much regularity in a family.</P>
<P>But what could Mrs. Stapleton mean, &s;aid I, when &s;he hinted to Mr. Stapleton, a &s;u&s;picion that he had been at the tavern? He does not practice drinking to exce&s;s, does he? Indeed, my dear, &s;aid he, I be|lieve it is too true to make a te&s;t of. But Mr. Sta|pleton did not practice this vice, when he was a &s;in|gle man: but now having but little peace at home, and not having &s;teadine&s;s of mind to govern his fami|ly, nor re&s;olution enough to guard again&s;t that vice, 'twill be well if he does not ruin his reputation. A man cannot follow that vice without an entire lo&s;s of his character: for a man mu&s;t appear in a mo&s;t dete&s;t|able light, that follows &s;uch a bea&s;tly practice. And then, &s;uch an one is not to be tru&s;ted in the di&s;charge of any bu&s;ine&s;s, as we know not when we may de|pend upon him.</P>
<P>And &s;o, my dear aunt, we di&s;cour&s;ed, till we arrived at our own hou&s;e.</P>
<P>I will now conclude this long epi&s;tle, by &s;ub&s;crib|ing my&s;elf your affectionate niece, or rather daughter,</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXVIII. From Mrs. <HI>POLLY DANFORD,</HI> to her Aunt FINTER.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My dear Aunt,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS you engaged me to &s;end you an ac|count of every thing worth notice, and as I love writ|ing, I will &s;end you another letter; and this &s;hall give you &s;ome account of my brother and &s;i&s;ter Murfee: for Mr. Danford, meeting with Mr. Murfee, had a long di&s;cour&s;e with him, who earne&s;tly de&s;ired that we would pay him a vi&s;it at his hou&s;e. For he &s;aid, that he wi&s;hed to di&s;cour&s;e with us when together. Up|on which, Mr. Danford promi&s;ed to wait upon him in a day or two.</P>
<P>Well, the next day we went, and were received by them in a very polite and affectionate manner.&mdash; Mr. Murfee met us at the door, and received us with an open and cheerful countenance, and conducted us into his parlour, where Jenny was ready to receive us, who, on our entering the room, aro&s;e and ran to me, &s;aying, it gives me inexpre&s;&s;ible joy and &s;atisfaction, to &s;ee you both at our hou&s;e. After compliments were over, we &s;eated our&s;elves and conver&s;ed on common topics for &s;ome time. After which Mr. Murfee &s;aid, I have earne&s;tly de&s;ired &s;uch an oppor|tunity as now pre&s;ents, to expre&s;s my mind to you both, my brother and &s;i&s;ter; and I feel my&s;elf happy that you have conde&s;cended to vi&s;it me: and hope now, that you will not hate and di&s;pi&s;e me, though I have acted a ba&s;e and fooli&s;h part with Mr. Gran|ville, while you was ab&s;ent. For as you mu&s;t have
<PB N="92" REF="033734_0090_0FF8F1AAAD6EBCC0">
felt the injury, I &s;hall endeavour to make you repara|tion:&mdash;I do therefore mo&s;t &s;incerely a&s;k forgivene&s;s of you both; and hope, that after you have been made &s;en&s;ible how truly I repent of my behaviour to Mr. Granville, you will endeavour to look upon me in the &s;ame light, as if I had acted the part of a &s;on to a parent. And if you can look upon me as a broth|er, do be &s;o kind as to a&s;&s;ure me of it. Dear Sir, &s;aid Mr. Danford, you have done nothing again&s;t me; but I am glad you are &s;en&s;ible of your neglect, in not a&s;&s;i&s;ting Mr. Granville in his &s;traits: but I dare &s;ay, that he waits for nothing but an opportunity to for|give you. And I doubt not, now, but that you will &s;oon give him that plea&s;ing &s;atisfaction: for it is a plea&s;ure to him to forgive an injury.</P>
<P>Well, &s;i&s;ter Polly, &s;aid Mr. Murfee, can you look upon us the &s;ame as if none of the&s;e mi&s;under&s;tandings had taken place?</P>
<P>Dear Sir, &s;aid I, you need not have a&s;ked me &s;uch a que&s;tion, for I &s;hall ever look on you as a brother; and I hope the&s;e mi&s;under&s;tandings will &s;oon be com|promi&s;ed,</P>
<P>I hope then, &s;aid Mr. Murfee, that you will both a&s;&s;i&s;t me in bringing about this much de&s;ired recon|ciliation.</P>
<P>I will try all in my power, &s;aid Mr. Danford, to get the&s;e differences reconciled.</P>
<P>The&s;e differences, &s;aid Mr. Murfee, have been the cau&s;e of great anxiety of mind to me. But then, I believe they have been a great means of good to me, For many times, good comes out of evil: yet that is not a warrant for us to do wrong. For, believe me, Mr. Danford, though I u&s;ed to think, there was noth|ing in virtue or religion, but a mere name; yet I think quite otherwi&s;e now. And I flatter my&s;elf, that you will think the more favourable of me for this confe&s;|&s;ion: &s;eeing you are an advocate for virtue, and delight in it, and in tho&s;e who endeavour to practice it.</P>
<P>I rejoice, &s;aid Mr. Danford, that you are come over to the &s;ide of virtue&punc; For "her ways are ways of
<PB N="93" REF="033734_0091_0FF8BFC819D59238">
plea&s;antne&s;s, and all her paths are peace." And there is no compari&s;on between a life &s;pent in the ways of virtue, and one wa&s;ted in vice. I dare &s;ay, this is highly plea&s;ing to Mrs. Murfee. And I cannot but rejoice with her; for I know, that virtue and religion were always her boa&s;t.</P>
<P>Dear Sir, &s;aid Jenny, no event of my life ever gave me the joy which this has done&punc; nor ever did I know what it was to enjoy &s;ocial happine&s;s, till of late. And now, if my father was but reconciled to Mr. Murfee, I &s;hould feel my&s;elf without a wi&s;h for any thing in this world.</P>
<P>This, my dear aunt, was an agreeable relation to me, you may well think. To &s;ee Mrs. Murfee's counte|nance &s;parkle with &s;en&s;ibility, and to &s;ee the cheerful|ne&s;s of her looks, and the plea&s;ure which &s;eemed to pervade her mind; every word appearing to be &s;poken with a feeling &s;en&s;e of the happy turn Mr. Murfee had taken, were &s;cenes truly delightful, and &s;weetened my vi&s;it greatly. But to return; there was nothing el&s;e remarkable in our vi&s;it, &s;ave that, when we &s;et out for home, Mr. Danford invited Mr. and Mrs. Mur|fee to return the vi&s;it, and promi&s;ed them to be an ad|vocate with my father, on their behalf. They thank|ed him, and promi&s;ed to wait on us &s;oon.</P>
<P>The next day Mr. Danford fell into di&s;cour&s;e with my father concerning Mr. Murfee; wherein he told him that Mr. Murfee was exceeding &s;orry for his be|haviour to him, and earne&s;tly de&s;ired his forgivene&s;s. And really, continued Mr. Danford, Mr. Murfee is quite a different man from what he u&s;ed to be: and I hope, Sir, you will forgive him, and receive him into favour again.</P>
<P>If Mr. Murfee, &s;aid my father, is &s;orry for his be|haviour to me, and repents of his pa&s;t mi&s;conduct, and will a&s;k my forgivene&s;s, I &s;hall think it my duty to forgive him. And then Mr. Danford related to him what Mr. Murfee had &s;aid on the &s;ubject, which gave him great &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P><PB N="94" REF="033734_0092_0FF8F1AC8EC2A020">The next day, Mr. and Mrs. Murfee called upon us&mdash;Mr. Danford met them at the door, and con|ducted them into the parlour, where my father, mother, and my&s;elf were &s;itting. We all aro&s;e to receive them, and after the u&s;ual &s;alutations on both &s;ides, Mr. Murfee acco&s;ted my father as follows:</P>
<P>Dear Sir, I mo&s;t &s;incerely beg your forgivene&s;s: For I know I have acted the part of an undutiful &s;on with you, by neglecting to a&s;&s;i&s;t you when in di&s;tre&s;s. And indeed, my conduct at that time was not incon|&s;i&s;tent: for to my &s;hame, I now confe&s;s, that I had then no regard to virtue; but con&s;idered virtue and vice on a par: and did not trouble my&s;elf any further about tho&s;e nice di&s;tinctions (as I then called them) than ju&s;t to keep up my reputation. But I hope, Sir, you will believe me, when I declare, that &s;uch conduct as I then practi&s;ed, now appears odious to me; and that I now love virtue for virtue's &s;ake&punc; for the be|haviour of Mr. Danford and my &s;i&s;ter Polly, convinc|ed me, that there mu&s;t be &s;omething in virtue more than an empty name. And I think, I can now &s;ay, that virtue and religion appear amiable to me. And now, dear Sir, can you forgive me, and own me for one of our family again. I am glad, &s;aid my father, that your eyes are opened; and that you have &s;een your error. And as you have a&s;ked my forgivene&s;s, I freely grant it you, and hope you will &s;tand fa&s;t in the ways of virtue: For as vice carries its puni&s;hment along with it, &s;o virtue gives its reward, even whil&s;t we are in the practice of it.</P>
<P>And thus, my dear aunt, they di&s;cour&s;ed together, for &s;ome time; and this you may well think, was a happy period to my mother. Indeed, we all &s;eemed to be highly plea&s;ed with this reconciliation; and, in particular, my &s;i&s;ter Jenny, who &s;eemed to be all life, upon this occa&s;ion. For you may remember, I once mentioned to you, that there &s;eemed to be a la|tent concern in her countenance, ever &s;ince &s;he had been married. Though &s;he never &s;poke of it, yet one might plainly di&s;cern it in her face. But now &s;he has
<PB N="95" REF="033734_0093_0FF8BF61F43232A8">
that open cheerfulne&s;s in her looks, which &s;he u&s;ed to have in her maiden &s;tate. And indeed, &s;he &s;eems to be thrown back to eighteen again. I am, indeed, great|ly rejoiced for Jenny. My heart u&s;ed formerly to be grieved for her; for &s;he would not open her mind to any; but kept her troubles to her&s;elf; and tried to make her&s;elf as cheerful as po&s;&s;ible. But now &s;he &s;peaks freely of it, and &s;ays her happine&s;s is com|plete; and that &s;he did not know, till of late, the &s;weets of &s;ocial happine&s;s, &amp;c.</P>

<P>P. S. I had forgot to mention, that Mr. Danford &s;till continues exceeding fond of me. Indeed, he &s;eems to be more kind to, and tender of me, than ever. For, he &s;ays, that at this time, I need all the tender|ne&s;s he is capable of &s;howing. And accordingly he ever &s;peaks encouragingly to me; which I find to be a great &s;upport. For I often get into a melancholy mood, and train of thinking; and when Mr. Danford finds me in &s;uch a frame, he endeavours to cheer me, all in his power. And indeed, he is nobly calculated to &s;oothe the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, and &s;trenghten the feeble mind|ed. But you will think I am going to write another letter.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXIX. From Mrs. <HI>DANFORD,</HI> to her Aunt <HI>FINTER.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Ever dear Aunt,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>MY fir&s;t devoir I mu&s;t pay to you. For never does a day pa&s;s over me, without the remem|brance of the happy time I &s;pent in your family: which fills me with &s;o grateful a &s;en&s;e of the kindne&s;s you then &s;hewed me, as will not be effaced &s;o long as life endures. I have likewi&s;e to thank you for your kind letter; from which I received much plea&s;ure and benefit; e&s;pecially that part where you advi&s;ed me not to give way to de&s;ponding thoughts on my condi|tion, (you having di&s;covered my &s;ituation from the po&s;t&s;cript of my la&s;t) but to "put my tru&s;t in that pow|er, who is able to help in time of trouble." You like|wi&s;e a&s;&s;ured me of your prayers for my &s;afety. Now let me inform you that I have pa&s;t through the peril|ous hour; and have ju&s;t got about again. Ble&s;&s;ed be the great Di&s;po&s;er of all events, who appeared for me in the hour of di&s;tre&s;s; and "hath filled my heart with rejoicing and my mouth with prai&s;e!" I am now the mother of a noble &s;on; and our family have done nothing but rejoice, ever &s;ince this event. And in particular, my father &s;eems to be ten years younger, than he was before.</P>
<P>Mr. Danford, who &s;eeks every opportunity to plea&s;e my father, &s;aid, as &s;oon as our little &s;on was carried to him&mdash;this is William Granville Danford. I had al|mo&s;t &s;aid, you might &s;ee the bloom of youth flu&s;h in my father's face, and with a complacent countenance and looks full of &s;en&s;ibility, he looked at Mr. Danford, and then at me, &s;aying, with ec&s;tacy, how greatly do I rejoice in the birth of this child! He
<PB N="97" REF="033734_0095_0FF8F1B82C084338">
&s;hall be my &s;on, indeed he &s;hall: for, as I have no &s;on left, I &s;hall look upon this as my own, and &s;hall provide for him accordingly. And then, his being the &s;on of my beloved Mr. Danford and Polly, heightens his value in my e&s;timation, and will &s;ecure him my affections. And may he live to the age of man, and be a comfort to his parents, a &s;upport to the declining age of his grand-parents, and a glory to the land he lives in!</P>
<P>It gave Mr. Danford great &s;atisfaction to find he had plea&s;ed my father &s;o well. And, indeed, he is never better &s;atisfied, than when he doth any thing that plea&s;es him. I was likewi&s;e as well plea&s;ed my&s;elf. For I mu&s;t confe&s;s, that the little dear looked charming|ly to me: For I fancy, that I can &s;ee all that intrepidity, mixed with gentlene&s;s, &s;o con&s;picuous in the counte|nance of my dear Mr. Danford. But I would not wi&s;h to prai&s;e the little lamb too much. For, are we not my dear aunt, apt to &s;et too much by our children? We are apt to con&s;ider them as our own; indulging the an|ticipation of what may be for many years to come: al|though &s;o very liable to be deprived of them. But then, it is our duty to love our children; and be&s;ides; it is natural for us &s;o to do.</P>
<P>Mr. Danford is fonder of me than ever; and my father cannot keep out of the room where our child is: for his heart &s;eems to be bound up in the little dear. He is al&s;o very tender of me; and my mother is highly &s;atisfied with all our conduct. And indeed, we are a happy family: for all &s;eem to be emulous to excel in virtue; and vie with each other in acts of duty and friend&s;hip. Nor have we any of tho&s;e bad &s;ervants, that many complain of; which, perhaps, is owing more to the wi&s;e management, and good examples of Mr. Danford, than to our good fortune in procuring them.</P>
<P>The only earthly wi&s;h I can rea&s;onably indulge, is for the happine&s;s of &s;eeing my other parents. For, you know, I always con&s;idered you and my uncle as parents; you having always acted the part of parents

towards me. Of this kindne&s;s, I hope I &s;hall ever retain a grateful &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>Plea&s;e to pre&s;ent my love and re&s;pects to all friends; and a&s;&s;ure your&s;elf, that I am</P>

<HEAD>CONCLUSION.</HEAD>
<P>SUFFICE it now to &s;ay, that Mr. Gran|ville and Mr. Danford live together, in the utmo&s;t har|mony, cultivating but one intere&s;t; Mr. Danford being chief actor in bu&s;ine&s;s, and is exceeding careful to a&s;k advice of Mr. Granville in all affairs of importance, by which he &s;ecures his confidence entirely. Mr. Gran|ville doats on Mr. Danford greatly, ever &s;peaking well of him to all that comes within the circle of his ac|quaintance. And as Mr. Danford has obtained his confidence, Mr. Granville approves of all his proceed|ings; &s;eeming to think it impo&s;&s;ible for him to do a wrong thing.</P>
<P>Mrs. Danford makes a polite and agreeable gentle|woman; is kind, tender-hearted, pious, and, indeed every thing that is amiable. This emulates many to cultivate her friend&s;hip, which her mother &s;ees with plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>As Mr. Murfee has become a &s;ober gentleman, and has gained a reconciliation with Mr. Granville, he and Mrs. Murfee often vi&s;it him; and they now take great delight in the conver&s;ation of each other.</P>
<P><PB N="99" REF="033734_0097_0FF8F1BEDDE71720">Indeed, the whole of Mr. Granville's family, and children, live in love and unity, delighting them&s;elves in virtue and religion; practi&s;ing hone&s;ty and punctu|ality with all men; which gains them many friends. And there is a cheerfulne&s;s in their conver&s;ation which di&s;covers their happine&s;s, and which is apparent in their countenances, therefore it is a great plea&s;ure to be in their company.</P>
