<SALUTE>My LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>SINCE your Lordship seems to think, that an Account in general of the Fleet's good Success is not so satisfactory as one setting forth the Particulars, I here send it with as much Preview as the Matter will admit of. I must confess I was not much inclin'd to <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> you in this nature, not being <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> to see my Name in Print on any <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">; but since it is your Lordships Commands, I am the more enclined to give you the best Information I am able of the Action, having seen several Printed Relati|ons not very sincere.</P>
<P><HI>Wednesday</HI> in the Evening, being the Eighteenth of <HI>May,</HI> standing over for <HI>Cape le Hogue,</HI> I ordered Captain <HI>Gill<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters"></HI> in the <HI>Ch<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">ter,</HI> and the <HI>Charles</HI> Galley, to lie at such a distance to the Westward of the <HI>Fleet,</HI> that they might discover any Signals made from me.</P>

A|bout ten they <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> down upon us, I <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">ill ly|ing with my <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">-top <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> the Mast. I then observed Monsieur <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> the <HI>French</HI> Admiral, put out his Signal for Battel; I gave order that mine should not be hoisted till the Fleets began to engage, that he might have the fairer opportunity of co|ming as near me as he thought conveni|ent, and at the same time I sent Orders to Admiral <HI>Almende,</HI> that as soon as any of his Squadron could Weather the Enemies Fleet, they should Tack, and get to the Westward of them; as also to the Blue, to make sail and close the Line, they being at some distance a-stern; but as soon as the Fleet began to Engage it fell calm, which prevented their so doing. About half an Hour after eleven, Monsieur <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> in the <HI>Royal-Sun</HI> (being within Three Quarters Musquet-shot,) brought to, lying by me at that distance about an Hour and an half, plying his Guns very warmly; though I must observe to you, that our Men <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> their Guns faster; after which time I did not find his Guns were fired with that vi|gour as before, and I could see him in great Disorder, his Rigging, Sails, Top-sail Yards being shot, and no body endeavouring to make them serviceable, and his Boats tow|ing of him to Windward, gave me reason to think he was much ga<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">l'd. About two the Wind shifted to the N. W. and by W. and some little time after that five fresh Ships of the Enemies Blue Squadron came and posted themselves, three a-head of Monsieur <HI>Tourville,</HI> and two a-stern of him, and fired with great Fury, which continued till after three. About four in the Evening there came so thick a Fog, that we could not <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> of the Enemies, which occa|sioned our leaving off firing for a little time, and then it cleared up, and we could see Monsieur <HI>Tourville</HI> towing away with his Boats to the Northward from us; upon which I did the same, and ordered all my Division to do the like; and about half an Hour after Five, we had a small breeze of Wind Easterly. I then made the Signal for the Fleet to Chase, sending Notice to all the Ships about me, that the Enemy were running. About this time I heard several Broad-sides to the <HI>W</HI>estward, and though I could not see the Ships that fired, I conclu|ded them to be our Blue, that by the shift of <HI>W</HI>ind had weathered the Enemy; but it proved to be the Rear-Admiral of the Red, who had weathered <HI>Tourville's</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> and got between them and their Ad|miral of the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> where they lay firing some time and then <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> with some Ships of his own Division as also the Reer-Admiral of the Red with some of his. This was the time that Cap|tain <HI>Hi<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">ings</HI> in the <HI>Sandwich</HI> was killed, he driving through those Ships, by reason of his Anchors not being clear. I could not see this part because of the great smoke &amp; Fog, nor have received this Information from <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>Cl<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">desly <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> since. I sent to all the Ships that were near me, to Chase to the Westward all night; telling them, I de|signed to follow the Enemy to the <HI>Brest;</HI> and sometimes we could see a <HI>French</HI> Ship, two, or three, standing away with all the Sail they could make to the <HI>W</HI>estward, which <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> about half an hour, it being some of our Blue falling-in with some of the Ships of the Enemies in the Fog. It was Foggy, and very little wind all night.</P>
<P><HI>Fri<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters"></HI> the 20th, 'twas so thick in the morn|ing, that I could see none of the Enemies Ships, and but very few of our own. About Eight it began to clear up; the Dutch, who were to the Southward of me, made the Sig|nal of seeing the Enemy; and, as I cleared, I saw about 32 or 34 Sail, distant from us, be|tween two and three Leagues, the Wind at E. N. E. and they bearing from us W. S. W. our Fleet chasing with all the Sail they could make, having taken in the Signal for the line of Battle, that each Ship might make the best of her way after the Enemy. Between Ele|ven and Twelve, the wind came to the S. W. The French ply'd to the Westward with all the Sail they could, and we after them. A|bout Four the Tide of Ebb being done, the French anchor'd, as also we in 43 Fathom water, <HI>Cape B<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">rsleur</HI> bearing S. and by W. About Ten in the Evening we weighed with the Tide of Ebb, the wind at S. W. and ply'd to the Westward. About Twelve my Fore-Topmast came by the Board, having re|ceived several Shot.</P>
<P><HI>Saturday</HI> the 21<HI>st,</HI> we continued still ply|ing after the Enemy, till Four in the Morn|ing. The tide of Ebb being done, I anchor'd in 46 Fathom Water, <HI>Cape de Hague</HI> bearing S. and by W. and the <HI>Island of Alderney</HI> S.S.W By my Topmast's going away, the Dutch Squadron, and the Admiral of the blue, with several of his Squadron, had got a great way to windward of me. About seven in the Morning several of the Enemies Ships, being far advanced towards the <HI>Race,</HI> I percei|ved driving to the Eastward with the Tide of Flood, between Eight and Nine, when they were driven so far to the Eastward that I could fetch them, <HI>I</HI> made the Signal for the Fleet to cut and follow the Enemy; which they all did, except the aforementioned wea|thermost Ships, which rid fast, to observe the motion of the rest of the Enemies Ships that continued in the <HI>Race of Alderney.</HI> About E|leven, I saw three great Ships fair under the Sho<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters"> Tack and stand to the westward: but making two or three short Boards, the big|gest of them run ashoar, who presently cut his Masts away; the other two being to lew|ard of him, ply'd up to him: The reason, as <HI>I</HI> judge, of their doing this was, that they could

not weather our sternmost Ships to the west|ward, nor <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> a head of Us to the East|ward. I observing that many of our <HI>S</HI>hips hovered about those, I sent to Sir <HI>Ralph D<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">|lav<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">l,</HI> Vice-admiral of the Red, who was in the Reer of our Fleet, to keep such a num|ber of Ships and Fire-Ships with him, as might be sufficient to destroy those of the E|nemies and to order the other's to follow <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">, I being then in pursuit of the rest of the Enemy. An account of the performing that service I don't trouble your Lordship with, He having given it you already. About Four in the afternoon 18 Sail of the Enemies Ships got to the Eastward of <HI>Cape Bars<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">;</HI> after which, I observed they hawled in for <HI>Le Hogue:</HI> The Reer-Admiral of she Red, Vice-Admiral of the <HI>B</HI>lew, and some of the <HI>S</HI>hips were a-head of me. About ten at night, I anchored in the Bay of <HI>Le Hogue,</HI> and lay till Four the next Morning, being</P>
<P><HI>Sunday</HI> the 22<HI>d;</HI> and then I weighed, and stood in near the Land of <HI>Le Hogue:</HI> but when we found the Flood came, we anchored in good sandy Ground. At two in the afternoon we weighed again, and ply'd close in with <HI>Le Hogue,</HI> where we saw 13 Sail of the Ene|mies Men of <HI>W</HI>ar hawled close in with the shoar: The Rear-Admiral of the Red tells me, That the night before he saw the other five, which made up the 1<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>I</HI> first chased, stand to the Eastward.</P>
<P><HI>Monday</HI> the 23d, I sent in <HI>Vice</HI> Admiral <HI>R<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">k</HI> with several Men of <HI>W</HI>ar and Fire|ships, as also the Boats of the Fleet, to de|stroy those Ships: but the Enemy had got|ten them so near the Shoar, that not any of our Men of <HI>W</HI>ar, except the small Frigats could do any Service; but that night <HI>Vice-Admiral Ro<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">k</HI> with the Boats burnt six of them.</P>
