<P>Not quite, my Lady&punc; for when he found I could not abide him, he propo&s;ed to introduce General Wa&s;hington to me. The General was a very pretty Gentleman, and I con&s;ented to it, on purpo&s;e to get rid of Harri&s;on.</P>

<P><HI>Codfi&s;h at Bo&s;ton!</HI> it is really an odd term, Betty, but he did no more than that old fool Putnam would have done: his not forbidding that in&s;ult to hu|manity, at New-York, was countenancing an act of barbari&s;m; and none, but a little-minded barbarian,

<P>Gentlemen, &s;pies from Flat-Bu&s;h inform, that the regulars are making a di&s;po&s;ition to cro&s;s the hills, near that place.&mdash;General Putnam's wi&s;dom in ordering that road to be flanked with brea&s;t-works, is now apparent. Lord Stirling, with his u&s;ual intre|pidity and preci&s;ion, has reconnoitered their numbers,
<PB N="13" REF="014660_0011_0F94570A0CB65948">
which he finds to be about &s;even thou&s;and. General Sullivan has appointed the hill with exqui&s;ite judgment; where the Brigades under him and Lord Stirling, are to take po&s;t, and act as occa&s;ion may require: twelve thou&s;and men are allotted for the &s;ervice of &s;ending them back to their &s;hips. I, with eight thou&s;and, will &s;tay within the&s;e lines, to be called out to the &s;laughter and pur&s;uit; unle&s;s our pre&s;ent deliberations, alter this plan of operation. My Lord, the Council expects your opinion.</P>

<P>I ri&s;e to give it, to the mo&s;t re&s;pectable, and mo&s;t pui&s;&s;ant council of general officers, that this or any other age ever produced. I would not pre&s;ume, Gentlemen, to &s;peak in this place, without being con|&s;cious that I po&s;&s;e&s;e the energy and oratory of a <HI>Burke!</HI> or even write on the &s;ubject, but that I feel the powers, and the pen of a <HI>Junius!</HI> That I reconnoitered them is mo&s;t true; and if my weak opinion has any weight in council, I am for <HI>&s;urrounding</HI> them, and when we have got them hemmed in, I am then for &s;ending to our noble Commander in chief, in the&s;e lines,&mdash;to know what to do with them.</P>

<P>Good betide them both.&mdash;After this fu&s;tian, a little &s;ober rea&s;oning, General Sullivan, may fit the mind for the doubtful events of war. My apprehen&s;ions from the King's troops, believe me, are trifling, compared with the ri&s;que we run, from the people of America at large. The tyranny, that our ac|cur&s;ed u&s;urpation has made nece&s;&s;ary, which they now feel, and feeling, I fear, will &s;oon make them &s;ee thro' the di&s;gui&s;e. Their rage, no doubt, will be heightened, by the &s;laughter that will probably en&s;ue; and we, as members of the Congre&s;s, fall the fir&s;t victims of it.&mdash; O Sullivan! my heart never con&s;ented to this ruin of my native country!</P>

<P>My dear General, the moments for reflection are elap&s;ed, and irrecoverable, Our &s;afety is fir&s;t in conque&s;t; if that is denied to our endeavours, I am &s;ure, we can obtain better terms, from our much in|jured Sovereign, than from our more injured country: &mdash;but wear a le&s;s rueful countenance; it is a proverb among the troops, that their General is much melted down, &s;ince the fleet arrived.</P>

<P>Our &s;oldiers are a &s;tanding miracle to me: they define &s;en&s;ibly upon matters that are unimportant to them, and re&s;ign their powers of thinking to us, in a ca&s;e where their all is at &s;take; and do not yet di&s;co|ver, that we make them the engines of our power, at the expence of all that is dear and &s;acred to them as men!&mdash;but avaunt reflection!

<P>True, good Sir: and I laugh to think, that when we have e&s;tabli&s;hed our power, and driven the&s;e Red-coats into the &s;ea, what ripping reformation you Gentlemen will make in church affairs.

<SPEAKER>SNUFF.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why really, General, we &s;hall be very apt to make free with tho&s;e Gentlemen. We have long beheld, with a jealous eye, the growing power of the Epi&s;co|pal Clergy; and con&s;idered them as the only ob&s;tacle

to our becoming the heads of the Church, in America; a dignity, that &s;o properly belongs to the Elect, and for which, they have had the a&s;&s;urance to contend with the Lord's own people. As for the Quakers, who in general have joined the tories again&s;t us, we &s;hall not fail to produce "an ancient te&s;timony" in their behalf: I mean the te&s;timony of our forefathers; till with fines, whipping, impri&s;onment, and the gallows, we have extirpated them from the face of the earth.</P>
