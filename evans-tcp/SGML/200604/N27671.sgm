<P>Inscribed to the Memory OF THE AMERICAN FABIUS, BY DOCTOR ISAAC BALL, OF NEW-YORK.</P>
<P>Reader! If thou art an American, Behold the tomb with reverence and regret, Where rest the remains of George Washington.</P>
<P>The kindest relation, the truest friend, the warmest patriot, the worthiest man.</P>
<P>He exercised virtues in an age, Sufficient to have distinguished him even in the best.</P>
<P>Sagacious by Nature, Industrious by Habit, Inquisitive with Art.</P>
<P>He gained a complete knowledge of the state of America, <HI>FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC.</HI></P>
<P>He served his Country always, At every age and in every station.</P>
<P>This was the bent of his generous soul: This was the business of his laborious life.</P>
<P>Public men and public things, He judged by one common standard, The true Interest OF THE United States.</P>
<P>He made no distinction of party.</P>
<P><HI>Gentle, Humane, Disinterested, Beneficent,</HI> He created no enemies on his own account:</P>
<P>FIRM, DETERMINED, INFLEXIBLE, He FEARED NONE he could create in the cause of AMERICA.</P>
<P>READER! In this misfortune of thy Country, lament thy own:</P>
<P>FOR KNOW&mdash;The loss of so much PRIVATE worth Is a PUBLIC calamity.</P>
