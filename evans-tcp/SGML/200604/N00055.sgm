<P>THE Judgement to come, as it is most Formidable and Dread|full to the Wicked; so it is most Sweet and Comfortable to those that are truely godly, being the <HI>Day of their Redemption,</HI> Luke 21. 28. <HI>The Time of Refreshing</HI> Acts 3. 19. and, <HI>The time of Restitution,</HI> ver.21. when all shall be Restored which God hath spo|ken of, and when among other thing all our Losses shall be fully Restored; the loss of the Image of God by the Fall: for, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 15. 49. <HI>As we have born the image of the Earthly, so we shall bear the

<P>Now had the main Subject of the fol|lowing Discourse a better Head and Heart to deal in and about it, it might be very advantageous to draw men seriously to Repent, according to that in <HI>Acts</HI> 17. 30, 31. and to quicken them up to <HI>watch and pray alwayes, that they may be counted worthy to escape those things that are coming upon the world, and to stand before the Sun of Man,</HI> Luke 21. 36. But what I have, I offer to thy candid View, and to thy Serious Thoughts, concerning this great Subject of <HI>The Last Judgement.</HI></P>
<P>Some Hints there are (and but Hints) which may make a gracious heart chear|fully to desire after that Day, and elevate, and sublimate his Spirit Heaven-ward. Some other things indeed are terrible, but

Let Jesus Christ be yours: Get a sure Portion and Interest in him; and if he that is to be your <HI>Judge,</HI> be your <HI>Saviour,</HI> this great Day, and the great Transactions then, will not be dreadful to you.

<P>My hearts desire is, knowing the Ter|rour of the Lord, to perswade men; and if this small Script may but by the Bles|sing of God be Effectual to fit any of my dear Countrey-men to look upon <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> with Comfort at that Day, and that they and I may, among the rest of the Sheep, be set at his Right Hand, and hear tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> blessed Sentence of Absolution pro|nounced upon us, I have enough. Then he that is in the Bosome of the Father, will put us in his Bosome, and reveal all his Bosome-Secrets, and Bosome-Counsels, and Bosome-Consolations, and Bosome-Love, and open all the Treasures that are with him, to enrich us to all Eternity. Then we shall fully Comprehend the Breadth, and Length, and Depth, and Height, and know <HI>the Love of Christ that passeth knowledge,</HI> which the best of us do but in part comprehend and know here: <HI>For when that which is perfect to come, then

that which is imperfect shall be done as way.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Good Reader,</HI> I have given thee a short account about the Publishing of these poor Labours of mine, beseeching the Lord that his mighty Spirit may go along with them, that good may be done by them, and Souls won to him; and that he may be glorified, when he comes to be <HI>admired in his Saints, and in them that Believe,</HI> at that Day.</P>
<P>I have done, after I have said one thing more: If thou and I be made more Spi|ritual and Heavenly, in our Looks, and Longings, and Breathings after Immorta|lity, by this Discourse, and be any way better fitted to meet the Lord at that Day; if our Desires be more quickened after the sweet Views of his Blessed Face, whom we yet never saw, but by an Eye of Faith; if after a few tossings with Tem|pest in the Sea of this World, we arrive at those fair Havens of Eternal Rest in a state of Glory, to sing everlasting <HI>Halle|lujahs</HI> and Praises to the God of our Mercy,

<P>IN these words we have a lively description of Christs coming to the <HI>Last Judgement:</HI> Wherein we have 1. The Prepara|tion: 2. The Sentence. The former is set forth 1. In the Glory of Christ the Judge. 2. In his Retinue. 3. In his Mag|nificence, He shall sit upon his glorious Throne. 4. By his Power, All Nations shall be gathered before him. 5. By his Separation between the Elect and Reprobate. 6. By his Disposing of both sorts, the Elect to his right hand, the Reprobate to his left. In the Sen|tence we have 1. What he pronounceth to the Elect: 2. To the Reprobate.</P>
<P>In the Sentence pronounced upon the Elect, we have 1. A description of them; they are his Fathers blessed ones. 2. His sweet admittance of them into his fellow|ship. 3. His possessing them of their Inheritance; which Inheritance is set forth by the preparation of it of old.</P>
<P>The Reason he is pleased to yield of all this grace of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> towards them, taken from his own work upon them, in shewing mercy to his Members and Brethren, which he reckons as done to himself. 5. Their modest question to him, as if they could not own any thing that they had done to him. 6. His gracious answer to them, and testification of his acceptance of what they had done for him in the least of his Brethren, to <HI>Ver.</HI> 41.</P>
<P>In the Sentence pronounced against the Reprobates, we have 1. A description of them; they are cursed ones. 2. His Abdication of them from his Presence, <HI>Depart fro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> me:</HI> wherein the punishment of loss is set forth. 3. The punishment of Sense inflicted upon them, held out under the notion of <HI>Fire.</HI> And 4. The duration and continuance
<PB N="3" REF="000094_0016_0FA0196FD5515DF0">
of that punishment; it is Everlasting fire. 5. The prepa|ration of it. 6. The woful Companions they must have in that fire, the Devil and his Angels. 7. The Reason of all this, taken from their unmercifulness to Christ in his Brethren and Members. 8. Their bold denial of his Charge of Unmercifulness, in the question they put&punc; <HI>When saw we thee,</HI> &amp;c. 9. Christs full answer to them, whereby he stops their mouthes that they shall not have a word to say against him. 10. The issue and result of all, both towards the Reprobate, and towards the Elect: The Reprobate <HI>go into everlasting punishment,</HI> and <HI>the Righteous into life eternal.</HI></P>

<P>For opening of which, let me shew 1. Wherein his Glory will then appear. 2. What his holy Angels are to do at that day. 3. Why he will come in such Glory. 4. The Uses.</P>

He will come and manifest himself in the Glory of his Grace and Mercy towards his Elect ones, in receiving them to himself, <HI>Joh.</HI> 14. 3. 1 <HI>Thess.</HI> 4. 17. 3. He will come and manifest himself in the Glory of his Justice to both Elect and Reprobate, 2 <HI>Thess.</HI> 1. 6,7,8,9. 4. He will come and manifest himself in the Glory of his Faithfulness, in making good to the full all his Promises to them; for then there will be a full accomplishment of them all, <HI>Heb.</HI> 10,23, 1 <HI>Thess.</HI> 5. 24. 5. He will come and manifest himself in the Glory of his Kingdome, for then he will shew himself a glorious King, both in subduing his and his peoples Enemies, and in treading upon the necks of them: as also in gathering all his Subjects about him, and bringing them to the bent of his blessed will, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 15. 25,26,27. <HI>Mat.</HI> 6. 10. 6.

<P><HI>Use</HI> 1. of the first Branch <HI>for Information</HI> 1.

We see the blessed condition of the Saints of Christ, that He himselfe will put honour upon at that day: <HI>Haman</HI> thought it a great part of his happiness, that he was so honoured by the King, and that he was in hope of more honour, <HI>Esiber</HI> 6. 5,6 But oh how happy are they that Christ will delight to hon|our at that day! 4. We see that we need never repent that we have been servants unto Christ, for we have served such a master as will surely honour us. If he that waiteth on his Master come to honour, <HI>Prov</HI> 27. 18. much more they that wait upon such a master as he is. 5. Wee see how contemptible the honour of the World should be, we should trample upon it with disdain, rather then lose the hope of Christs honour at that day. 6. We see that they that seeks Christs Honour more then their own shall be no loosers by it, for he will honour them at that day. 7. We see with what diligence, and chearfulness we should goe a|bout our Masters service, for he will Honour us at that day. 8.

<P>Doct. VIII. <HI>That before the dreadfull Sentence of con|demnation be pronounced against the Reprobate, the elect Saints shall be absolved and acquitted.</HI> He begins with them first.</P>
<P><HI>Reasons.</HI> 1. They are appointed to rise first. 1. <HI>Thes.</HI> 4. 17 and that may be a pledg of their Sentence of absolution, to be first passed upon them. 2. They are to sit with Christ to judg the world, and to judg Angels, 1 <HI>Cor</HI> 6. 2,3. and therefore it is meet they should be first absolved &amp; acquit|ed, before y^t sentence of condemnation be passed upon the reprobate. 3. The Lord will have them to be without fear at that day: now if they should not be first in their sentence of absolution, they could not chuse but be affraid
<PB N="30" REF="000094_0043_0FA01990BB11B058">
at the dreadfull sentence of condemnation upon repro|bates: and therefore that the Judg may take away all fear from them at that day, he first begins with them, and ac|quits them. 4. That day is the day of their Redemption <HI>Luke</HI> 21. 28. and if it were not so, that they were first ac|quitted, it could not be so, for they would be in captivity to trouble and trembling, and then it could not be a day of redemption to them. 5. That day is a day of refresh|ing to the Saints, <HI>Acts</HI> 3. 19. and that it may appear to be a day of refreshing to them, they are first acquitted before the other are condemned. 6. The day is called the day of Restitution, <HI>Acts</HI> 3. 21. wherin all that the Lord hath promised, shall be restored to them, all their peace, all their comfort, all their p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">viledges, all their honour shall be restored to them at that day: and therefore they are first to have the sentence of absolution passed upon them. 7. At that day they are to have dominion over the wicked. <HI>Psal.</HI> 49. 14. &amp; this is part of their dominion, that they shall have the sentence of absolution first passed upon them. 8.

But suit would not be if y^e Saints were not first to be absolved. 9 That day is y^e day of clearing. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 4. 5. wherin hidden things are to be brought to light, and the Saints are to have praise of God, and when they come to be first absolved, then this will be. 10. That day is the day of Christ, <HI>Phil.</HI> 1. 6. and the day of God, 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 3. 12. where|in the Wisedome of Christ and the Justice of Christ shall shine forth: and all these will appear manifestly, in passing the sentence of absolution first upon elect ones. 11. That day is called the great day. <HI>Iude verse</HI> 6. and that is one reason of it, in that the Lord Jesus will then make his name so great in the admiring of his Saints, 2 <HI>Thes.</HI> 1. 10. in the sentence of absolution that he first passeth upon them.</P>
<P N="12">12. That day is the day when he will reward his servants, <HI>Apoe.</HI> 22. 12, and that is one principall thing in the reward of his servants, that he doth first cheer their hearts, in ab|solving them, before he come to pronounce the dreadfull sentence of condemnation against the wicked.</P>
<P><HI>Use</HI> 1. <HI>for Information:</HI> 1.

We see a reason why Christ shall be so glorified in his Saints at that day, 2 <HI>Thes</HI> 1. 10. there is good cause why it should be so, for he will first be|gin with absolving them, before he do any thing else at y^e day of judgment. 5. We see why he should be the first and chief with us, the first in our desires, and above all others in our esteem, <HI>Psal</HI> 73. 25 <HI>Cant.</HI> 5. 10 for we shall be the first with him at that day, he will first acquit us before he do any thing else at the great day. 6. We see what great reason we have to justifie and clear him in all is dispansa|tions of himselfe to us, in all the afflictions, troubles, and all the evils that pass over our heads in this World, <HI>Psal.</HI> 51. 4. <HI>Nebem.</HI> 9. 3<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">. for as he doth here acquit us in his word, and by his spirit, so at that day he will with his own blessed mouth pass the blessed sentence of absolution upon us, and it shall be the first thing that he will then do. 7 We see that what the Lord calls his Servants to, he will then surely inable them to, and remove that they might hinder them, he calls his servants then to an honourable work, to Judg the World, to Judg Argells, and that they may not be in the least surprized with fear and so hindred, he takes that away and first passeth the sentence of absolu|tion upon them, before he condemn the wicked World. 8. We see what tenderness we should use toward his Saints and people, we should do what we can to take them off from all their feares, such as are in temptation that are full of feares, if we judg them such as Christ hath acquitted and will acquit at that day, we should do as he doth, do what we can to take them off from all their feares, 1 <HI>Thes.</HI> 5 14. <HI>Isai</HI> 35. 3,4. 9. We see the Wisedome and Justice of Christ Jesus the Judge that he will have nothing to trouble is Saints with, it is the wisdome and justice of an earthly Judg to incourage those that are innocent and acquit them: So here 2 <HI>Tim</HI> 4. 8. 10.

will acquit them and absolve them before his Father and the Holy Angels and the whole World, it is an honour to a poor man that is brought before an earthly Judg to be acquitted before all the company that are present at the assize. Oh what an honour then will y^e Lord Jesus put upon them that are his Elect at that day whom he will acquit before God, Angels, and Men, when the whole World shall be convented before him: <HI>Such honour have all his Saints,</HI> if the Psalmist said so upon a less occasion, <HI>Psal.</HI> 149. 9. much more may we say so upon this. 11. We see what a mercy it is to be acquitted here, in the assurance of the pardon of our Sins, <HI>Psal.</HI> 32. 1,2. for it is a blessed p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">edg of our acquitting at that day. 12. We see how cor|dially the Lord Jesus will absolve his Elect ones at that day, for he it is that hath satisfied divine Justice, and payd all their debts for them, and therefore will heartily acquit them, and with much cheerfulness pronounce the sentence of absolution upon them.</P>
<P><HI>Use</HI> 2. <HI>for Terrour</HI> to wicked men: For this must needs add to their Horrour and Amazement, that others are ac|quitted and themselves in a fearfull expectation of being Condemned.

<P><HI>Dect.</HI> XIII. <HI>That the Kingdome that the Saints shall en|joy in Heaven, is estated upon them as an Inheritance:</HI> So 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 1. 3,4. <HI>Heb.</HI> 9. 15. <HI>Acts</HI> 20,32. <HI>&amp;</HI> 26. 18. <HI>Eph.</HI> 1. 11,14. <HI>Coloss.</HI> 1. 12. <HI>&amp;</HI> 3. 24.</P>
<P>For opening of which, let me shew, 1. In what respects it may be said to be an Inheritance. 2. What manner of Inheritance it is. 3. Why they have it by Inheritance. 4. The Uses.</P>
<P>For the first: <HI>It may be said to be an Inheritance,</HI> 1. In regard of the purchase of it, <HI>Eph.</HI> 1. 14. Christ hath purcha|sed it for us: Inheritances are sometimes purchased; so this. 2. In regard of the gift of it: Inheritances are made over by gift; so this, <HI>Acts</HI> 20. 32. <HI>Coloss.</HI> 3. 24. 3. In regard of the new birth that we are partakers of, 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 1. 3,4. Inheritances are often by birth; so this: not by our first birth, (for that damns us) but by the second. 4. In regard of the honour and dignity of it: Inheritances are honourable things that are estated upon men, much more this; no honour like to this. 5. In regard of the non|alienation of it: Inheritances are not alienated to stran|gers&punc;
<PB N="45" REF="000094_0058_0FA019A1451B5B98">
so this Inheritance is not alienated to others, but is the propriety of the Saints, <HI>Acts</HI> 20. 32. <HI>&amp;</HI> 26. 18. 6. In regard of the right of it to the first born: Inheritances are the right of the first born, so this Inheritance, <HI>Heb.</HI> 12. 23. 7. In regard of the Conveyance of it: an Inheritance is conveyed by the death of a father or friend; so is this In|heritance conveyed to us by the death of Christ, <HI>Heb.</HI> 9. 15, 16. 8. In regard of the reservation of it, 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 1. 4. Inheritances are reserved for the right heirs; so this.</P>
<P>Q. 2. <HI>What manner of Inheritance is it?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> 1. It is incorruptible, 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 1. 4. 2. It is un|defiled, <HI>ibid.</HI> 3. It fades not away, <HI>ibid. Heb.</HI> 9. 15. 4.

It is a joyful Inheritance, <HI>Mat.</HI> 25. 21,23.</P>
<P>Q. 3. <HI>Why have they it by Inheritance?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> 1. They are joynt heirs with Christ, <HI>Rom:</HI> 8. 17. 2. It is prepared for them: so the Text. 3. They are cal|led to it, 1 <HI>Pet:</HI> 3. 9. <HI>&amp;</HI> 5. 10. 4. They have the promise of it, <HI>Heb:</HI> 9. 15. 5. They have the earnest of it, <HI>Eph:</HI> 1. 14. 6. They have the hope of it, <HI>Col:</HI> 1. 5. 7. They have a taste of it in the peace and joy that they have here in their souls, <HI>Rom:</HI> 5. 1,2. 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 1. 8. 8. The Lord Jesus their Head hath taken possession of it for them, <HI>Heb:</HI> 6. 20. 9. The writings are drawn, the Seals put to, the Witnesses are for the con|firmation of it, <HI>Heb:</HI> 6. 17,18. <HI>Eph:</HI> 1. 13. 1 <HI>John</HI> 5. 7,8,11. 10. They long for the day when they shall come to be pos|sessed of it, as other heirs do, <HI>Cant:</HI> 8. <HI>ult. Rev:</HI> 22. 20.</P>
<P><HI>Use</HI> 1. <HI>for Information:</HI> 1. We see what a firm state the Saints shall enjoy in Heaven, for its an inheritance; for what is held by inheritance is most firm, and sure, and stable hold, they shall never be removed from their blessed Te|nure in Heaven. 2. We see what a peaceable possession we shall there enjoy: Inheritances, of all other Tenures, are enjoyed most peaceably; they are most unquestionable te|nures, and therefore most peaceably possessed: so this, we shall never be disturbed when we come in Heaven. 3. We see what desires we should have after the possession of that estate: young heirs in minority long to be at a full age, that they may possess their inheritances; so should we, that we may possess ours. 4. We see in what esteem the Saints should be with us, for they are great heirs, and shall have a great inheritance another day: Great heirs on earth are esteemed highly; how much more should these?

and Creditors do not reckon for such sums which are blot|ted out, and do not so much as mention or speak of them. 3. In that they are all covered, <HI>Psal.</HI> 32. 1. <HI>&amp;</HI> 85. 2. <HI>Neh.</HI> 4. 5. and if they be covered, then sure they shall not be discovered or spoken of at that day. 4. In that they are forgotten and not remembred, <HI>Isa.</HI> 43. 25. <HI>Psal.</HI> 25. 7. <HI>&amp;</HI> 79. 8. <HI>Jer.</HI> 31. 34. <HI>Heb.</HI> 8. 12. <HI>&amp;</HI> 10. 17. And if so, how should they then be spoken of? 5. In that upon search they shall not be found, <HI>Jer.</HI> 50. 20. and things that cannot be found, are not mentioned nor spoken of among men: so here. 6. In that the Lord passeth them by, &amp; makes them as if they had never been committed, <HI>Mic.</HI> 7. 18. and if he pass them by, surely they shall never be spoken of at that day. 7. In that all their sins shall be cast into the depths of the Sea, <HI>Micah</HI> 7. 19. and therefore shall never come up more. Things cast into the bottom of the Sea never come up more: so here. 8. In that the Righteousness of Christ is imputed to them, <HI>Rom.</HI> 4. 6,7,8. <HI>Jer.</HI> 23. 6. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 1. 30. 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 5. 21. <HI>Cant.</HI> 4. 7. Now if his Righteousness be im|puted to us, then our sins surely shall not be spoken of at that day. 9.

<P>Q. 2. <HI>Why shall not their sins be then spoken of or men|tioned?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> 1. From the Lord Jesus. 2. From his Saints. 3. From their Enemies. 4. From the Day it self.</P>
<P><HI>From the Lord Jesus.</HI> 1. He hath promised, <HI>John</HI> 5. 24. that they shall not come into Condemnation: and if so, to what end shall their sins be mentioned at that day? 2. He hath delivered them from the wrath to come, 1 <HI>Thess.</HI> 1. 10. and that being so, there's no need that their sins should be mentioned. 3 He saves to the utmost, <HI>Hebr.</HI> 7. 25. and therefore from sin, and all the shame of it, which the men|tion of their sin might bring upon them. Other men shall rise to shame, <HI>Dan</HI> 12 2. but not they. 4. He hides their sins here, 1 <HI>Kings</HI> 15. 5. <HI>Heb.</HI> 11. 11,31. <HI>Jam.</HI> 5. 11. and if so, much more will he do it at that day. 5. He then comes to be glorified in his Saints, and to be admired in all them that believe, 2 <HI>Thess.</HI> 1. 10. but the mention of their sins would obscure that glory; and therefore they shall not be
<PB N="51" REF="000094_0064_0FA019AA40D55930">
at that day spoken of. 6. He then will fully acquit them and absolve them, <HI>as I said before,</HI> and therefore will not then mention any of them. 7. He will then present them faultless, <HI>Jude</HI> ver. 24.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>From the Saints.</HI> 1. They have blamed and shamed themselves for them here, <HI>Ezra</HI> 9. 6. <HI>Dan.</HI> 9. 7,8. <HI>Jer.</HI> 3. 25. and therefore he will not shame them at that day. 2. They have not hid them here, but discovered them and acknowledged them, <HI>Psal.</HI> 51. 3. <HI>Jer.</HI> 14. 7. <HI>Psal.</HI> 32. 5. and therefore no wonder if he hide them at that day. 3. They have been burthened with them here, <HI>Psal.</HI> 38. 4. <HI>Heb.</HI> 12. 1. and therefore he will not burthen them with the mention of them. 4. They have loathed and abhorred themselves for them here, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 36. 31. <HI>Job</HI> 42. 6. And will he them speak of them, to make them an abhorring to Men and Angels? he will not surely do it. 5. They have fasted, mourned and wept for them, prayed against them&punc; with|stood the motions that have been made to the commission of them, bewailed them bitterly, <HI>Judges</HI> 2. 4,5. 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 7. 6. <HI>Gal.</HI> 5. 17. <HI>Rom.</HI> 7. 23,24. and can we think that he will then speak of them, or mention them to their dishonour? 6. They have desired earnestly to be rid of them, and have counted that day happy wherein they have ceased to sin, and that has been the chiefest cause why they have desired to die, that they might sin no more, <HI>Phil.</HI> 1,23. 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 5. 4,6,8. And can it be thought then, that their sins shall be men|tioned at that day, that they desired so to be freed from? it cannot be imagined.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>From their Enemies.</HI> 1. They shall not have any oc|casion to reproach them, or Religion. 2. Nor to accuse them. 3. Nor to traduce the Judge. 4. Nor to cast Hy|pocrisie in their faces to shame them. 5. Nor to grieve them, for they shall not have any such thing befall them at, that day, <HI>Jude</HI> ver. 25. 6. Nor to rejoyce at the mention of them. 7. Nor to think better of themselves by reason of them.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>From the Day it self.</HI> 1. It is the day of the mani|festation of the righteous judgement of God; and being so, how should their sins be then spoken of? for it would not be just to shame the innocent as they be in Christ. 2. It is the day of their rest, 2 <HI>Thess.</HI> 1. 7. and that it could not be, if their sins were mentioned; it would be a day of dis-rest rather to them. 3. It is the day of their exceeding joy, <HI>Jude</HI> ver. 25. and that could not be, if their sins should be mentioned. 4. It is the day of their Coro|nation, 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 4. 8. and in such a day it were no way suitable

to make mention of their sins. 5. It is the day of there Redemption, <HI>Luke</HI> 21. 28. and it would rather be a day of their Captivity then Redemption, should there be any men|tion of their sins. 6. It is the day of the Consummation of the Marriage betwixt Christ and his Saints, they are be|trothed here, <HI>Hos.</HI> 2. 19,20. 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 11. 2. But the day of the Solemnization of the Marriage is then; then Christ takes us to house, <HI>John.</HI> 14. 3. to himself, 1 <HI>Thess.</HI> 4. 17. and the mentioning of their sins must needs be unsuitable to such a day.</P>

We see how loathsome and detestable every sin ought to be to us here, and how we should accuse, and arraign, and judge our selves for them, for they shall not be charged upon us then, nor any of them be so much as mentioned against us, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 11. 31,32. 5.

We see how ready we should be to forgive offending Brethren when they repent, <HI>Luke</HI> 17. 3,4. for so does Christ, and so will he do at that day, and not charge them with any of them. 7. We see that those sins that have been committed by any of the Saints in the time of their unregenerate estate, are not to be spoken of or mentioned to their disgrace, neither are they to be cast in their teeth, nor they to be upbraided with them, for not one of them shall be spoken of at that day, <HI>Acts</HI> 9. 13,<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, 15. 8.

<P>The second Branch of the XV. <HI>Doctrine</HI> is now to be spoken of; <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR></P>
<P><HI>That what the Saint have done well while they were on earth, shall be spoken of, and mentioned in the day of Judgement.</HI></P>
<P>For opening of which, let me shew, 1. How it does ap|pear that it shall be so. 2. Why it shall be so. 3. The Uses.</P>
<P>For the first: <HI>How does it appear that what good they have done shall be mentioned and spoken of at that day?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> 1. It does appear from hence, in that every secret good thing shall come into judgement, <HI>Eccles.</HI> 12. 14. 1 <HI>Cor</HI> 4. 5. 2. In that every good thing shall be rewarded, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 5. 10. <HI>Mat.</HI> 6. 4,6,18. <HI>Rev.</HI> 22. 12. 3. In that every man that hath done any good, though others have not known of it, shall have due praise and commendation for it, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 4. 5. 4. In that there shall be different depress of Glory, according to the different measures of good that men have done; and therefore all must be mentioned and spoken of, <HI>Rom.</HI> 2. 6. <HI>Rev.</HI> 22. 12. 5. In that good has been called evil in the world, <HI>Isa.</HI> 5. 20, and therefore all that good that has been so traduced, and evil spoken of, shall be owned and spoken of at that day. 6. In that the Saints here do vilifie and disesteem their best works, <HI>Isa.</HI> 64. 6. <HI>Phil</HI> 3. 8,9. and though indeed in themselves they be nothing worth, as coming from us, yet as they are in Christ, so they are good, and will be spoken of as such at that day. 7. In that it is not so easily discerned whose works are good, in regard that Hypocrites may go very far this way, but that day will declare which is which, which are good and which not. 8. In that for every right work a man i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> envied of his neighbour here, <HI>Eccles.</HI> 4. 4. 9. In that in sundry good works done here, it is not known who did them, and this must not alwayes be concealed.</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="000094_0068_0FA019AD48507AA0">
Q. 2. <HI>Why shall that that they have done well be then spoken of?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> 1. From God himself. 2. From the Lord Jesus Christ. 3. From the Saints themselves.</P>
<P><HI>From God.</HI> 1. He works them in us and for us, <HI>Isa.</HI> 26. 12. 2. He is glorified by them, <HI>Mat.</HI> 5. 16. <HI>Phil.</HI> 1. 11. 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 2. 12 3. He will reward them, <HI>Rom.</HI> 2. 6,7,10. and how should this be, if they be not spoken of at that day? 4. He has promised to honour them that honour him, 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 2. 30.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>From the Lord Jesus.</HI> 1. He commends them here, <HI>Rev.</HI> 2. 2,3,8,9. and therefore will do it much more here|after. 2. He knows their works, and therefore knows how to speak of them at that day, <HI>ibid.</HI> 3. He takes it well if it be but in the heart, though it come not to outward act, 1 <HI>Kings</HI> 8. 18,19 Oh how well will he then take it, when it is actually performed, and speak of them at that day! 4. He loves then dearly, and where we love, we use to speak much in commendation of what is done, much more will Christ at that day, <HI>Gal.</HI> 2. 20.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>From the Saints themselves.</HI> 1. They are his Members, Brethren, Fellows, Friends, Spouse, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and therefore no wonder that he will speak all the good of them that may be at that day 2. They have done what they have so done for his sake, and out of love to him, and therefore it is no wonder if he make mention of what they have done at that day. 3. They have aimed at the glory of his Name in what they have done, and no wonder then if he speak of what was done, at that day, <HI>John</HI> 15. 8. 4. They have done it out of obedience to the command of God and Christ, and that he cannot but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ake mention of at that day. 5. They are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, <HI>Eph.</HI> 2. 10. 6. They are his own blessed ones, there|fore he will speak good of them then.</P>
<P><HI>Use</HI> 1. <HI>for Information:</HI> 1. We see that none of the Saints need to repent of any of the good they have done; for though it may be they may be requited with evil here, yet the good we have done shall be spoken of at that day. 2. We see what great incouragement we have to benefi|cence in secret, for though no eye see it, nor any know of it, yet it shall be known at that day, <HI>Mat.</HI> 6. 4. 3. We see that a very little good done in sincerity, goes a great way with Christ Jesus, and is of high esteem with him: how little is it that the best of us do? what mites of service? yet these shall be spoken of too, <HI>Luke</HI> 21. 1,2,3,4. how much more at that day? 4. We see what a good Master we serve, that will reward his servants thus. 5. We see how
<PB N="56" REF="000094_0069_0FA019ADFA9E1A80">
lightly we should esteem the praises of men, compared with this, to have what we have done spoken of by Christ at that day. 6. We see that Christ takes notice of all our doings, for he will speak of them at that day. 7. We see how hum|bly we should behave our selves, and how meanly we should think of what we do, <HI>Luke</HI> 17. 10. 8.

In that he commends them that have been pitiful to them, <HI>Acts</HI> 9.39. 6. In that he rewards them for their kindness to them in clothing of them, <HI>Mat.</HI> 6.3,4. If he that gives a cup of cold water, <HI>Mat.</HI> 10.42. then much more he that gives Clothing to a Disciple shall not lose his reward. 7. In that he sends them in Clothes by wayes that they think not of, 2 <HI>Kings</HI> 7.8,15. 8. In that he takes it kindly when they are clothed, and offensively from them that do it not: so the Text. 9. In that he would not have them too solici|tous about clothing, <HI>Mat.</HI> 6. 31. which evidently shews, that himself is sensible of their want of it. 10.

<P>We come now to speak of the Fourth Branch of the XVII. Doctrine, <HI>That the Lord Jesus is very sensible of the Sicknesses of his Saints and people. I was sick,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>For opening of which, let me shew, 1. How it does ap|pear that he is so sensible of their Sickness. 2. Why. 3. The Uses.</P>
<P>For the first: It does appear that <HI>He is sensible of their Sickness;</HI> 1.

In that he is pleased some|times to heal, when the Physicians skill can do no good, <HI>Mark</HI> 5. 25&mdash;29. 4. In that he stirs up his people to pray for their healing, and grants their desires therein: and this we have great experience of, <HI>Psal.</HI> 65. 2. 5. In that he com|mands that the Elders of the Church should be sent for in such a case, with promise, that their <HI>Prayer of Faith shall save the sick.</HI> Jam. 5. 14,15. 6. In that he is sometimes very speedy in working their cure, <HI>Mark</HI> 5. 29. <HI>John</HI> 4. 50&mdash;53. 7. In that he has respect to their own Cries, and cures them, <HI>Psal.</HI> 107. 17&mdash;20. <HI>Jo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> 33. 19&mdash;26. <HI>Isa.</HI> 38. 2,3,4,5. 8.

<P>For the first: It does appear that <HI>He is very sensible of this state of theirs, and-counts himself in Prison with them;</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> In that he chears them, and comforts them in that con|dition, <HI>Acts</HI> 16. 24,25.

<P>We are now come to the second Branch of the XVIII. Doctrine, which is this, <HI>That Christ takes it very kindly when his Saints that are strangers are kindly entertained into our houses.</HI></P>
<P>For opening of which, let me shew, 1. How it does ap|pear that he takes their entertainment so kindly. 2. Why he takes it so kindly. 3. The Uses.</P>
<P>For the first: It does appear that <HI>He takes their enter|tainment very kindly;</HI> 1. In that he gives it in charge that we should do it, 1 <HI>Pet</HI> 4. 9. <HI>Heb.</HI> 13. 2. and he cannot but take it kindly when we observe his charge. 2. In that he commendeth those that are kinde this way, 3. <HI>John</HI> 5, 8. 3. In that he makes account that such are fellow helpers to the truth, ver. 8. and this the Lord cannot but take kindly. 4.

In that he stirs up the hearts of his Servants to wish for their health and outward pros|perity, 3. <HI>John</HI> 2. 6. In that he gives such to thrive and prosper in their Souls, <HI>ibid</HI> 7. In that he vouchsafes them the love of his precious Saints, yea, the love of all them that know the truth, 3 <HI>John</HI> 1. 8. In that he gives them such blessings as they could not well expect, 2 <HI>Kings</HI> 4. 14, 15, 16. 9. In that he has sometimes restored their children from death to life, 1 <HI>Kings</HI> 17. 2. <HI>Kings</HI> 4. 10. In that he has honoured them so, as that they have entertained Angels, <HI>Heb.</HI> 13. 2. 11. In that the whole Family is blessed

<P>Q. 2. <HI>Why does he take so kindly the entertainment that his people finde?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> 1. From <HI>himself:</HI> 1. He loves and preserves stran|gers, <HI>Psal</HI> 146. 9. 2. He sometimes was a stranger himself, and therefore cannot but take it kindly what is done in way of entertainment of them. 3. He hates and abhors the covetous, that do it not, <HI>Psal.</HI> 10. 3. and therefore cannot but take it kindly when we do entertain them. 4.

They are the very ravishment of his heart. <HI>Cant.</HI> 4. 9. 4. They are his Fathers blessed ones: so the Text. 5. They want entertainment very much, are sometimes in great distress for want of it, <HI>Judg.</HI> 19. 18,19. 6. They praise him when they have it.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>From the nature of Entertainment:</HI> 1. It is a fruit of their Faith, <HI>Heb</HI> 11. 31. So in the Widow of <HI>Sarepta</HI> and the <HI>Shunamite.</HI> 2. It flows from Love, and therefore we must not forget to do it, <HI>Heb,</HI> 13. 1,2. 3. It is a fruit of obedience to the Commandment, 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 4. 9. 4.

We see that the Lord takes special notice of small kindnesses shew|ed to his people, in that a little entertainment is so kindly taken. 6. We see how kindly we should take it when the Lord bows the hearts of his people to be courteous in en|tertaining of us, for Christ takes it kindly at their hands. 7.

In that he brings a good report upon them after they are dead, <HI>Acts</HI> 9.39. 3. In that he makes their death to be lamented, <HI>Acts</HI> 9. 39. 4. In that he sometimes has raised some that have been thus charitable from death to life, <HI>Acts</HI> 9.40,41. 5. In that the very loins of the poor bless them, <HI>Job</HI> 31. 20. 6.

<P>Q. 2. <HI>Why does he take it so kindly?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> 1. From himself. 2. From his Saints.</P>

<P N="2">2. <HI>From the Saints that are naked.</HI> 1. They cannot ask clothing, and therefore if they be supplied with it, Christ will take it kindly. 2. They serve him with their outward man, and their bodies are for him, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 6.13. 3. Their bodies are part of his Purchase, he has bought them with his blood, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>Cor</HI> 8. 20. and therefore must needs take it kindly when they are clothed. 4.

We see that though all we have be his, and he might command it all, yet he is so loving that he will take a little kindly at our hands, given to clothe his naked ones, <HI>Psal.</HI> 50. 4.

We see how humble the Lord Jesus is, that condescends to look after the naked's clothes, 8. We see that Cloth-workers are to be encouraged by us. 9. We see that they are not of Christs spirit, that can see the Saints go in rags. 10.

<P>The fourth Branch of the XVIII. Doctrine is this, <HI>That the Lerd Jesus <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> it very kindly when his sick Saints are visited by us, and will own it at the last day as done to him|self.</HI></P>
<P>For opening of which, let me shew, I How it does ap|pear that he takes the visiting of his sick Saints to kindly. 2. Why. 3. The Uses.</P>
<P>For the first: It does appear, 1. In that he does not let the visits that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> give to his sick servants, go without some reward, 2 <HI>Kings</HI> 13. 14, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> much less when one Saint visits another. 2 In that the Saints are ever better by such visits, both they that visit, and they also that are visited: for commonly they pray together, and speak gracious words together, and so both are bettered, <HI>Jam:</HI> 5. and such visits Christ cannot but take very kindly. 3. In that the sick come by such visits to be healed. <HI>Jam:</HI> 5. 14,15. 4. In that by such visits the sins which the sick have committed come to be forgiven: and to be a means of such an act of charity as that, must needs be kindly taken by Christ Jesus. 5. In that by such visits, the temptations, that sick ones are assaulted with, come often to be removed, and their hearts comforted. 6. In that the Lord commonly orders it, that they that have visited others shall be visited themselves. 7. In that the sick bless those that come to visit them, <HI>Gen.</HI> 48. 1,2,8,9,10,15,16. 8. In that he makes it a pledge of blessedness, <HI>Psal.</HI> 41. 1,2. 9. In that when such as have visited others come to be sick, the Lord will graciously visit such, <HI>Psal.</HI> 41. 3. 10. In that if it should be a sick|ness to do to, the living will lay it to heart, <HI>Eccles.</HI> 7. 2.</P>
<P>Q. 2. <HI>Why does the Lord take visits so kindly?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> 1. From himself 2. From his Saints.</P>
<P><HI>From himself.</HI> 1. He was willing to give such visits many times. 2. He looks at it as an act of our kindness, and he cannot but take our kindness kindly: if he be kinde to the unthankful and to the evil, <HI>Luke</HI> 5. 35. much more will he be so to them that shew kindness to his people. 3. He chargeth us to visit his sick ones, <HI>James.</HI> 14,15. 4. He pities sick ones, <HI>Mat:</HI> 8. 16,17. and therefore cannot but take it kindly when we out of pity visit them. 5.

We see how readily we should come off with this, seeing it is so kindly taken. 4. We see how kindly sick ones should take a visit, for Christ does. 5. We see how kindly we should take the Lords gracious visits to us, in sending Christ to us, <HI>Luke</HI> 1. 78. 6.

We see that we may not look at visitation of the sick as an arbitrary thing, but as our duty, being so highly set by. 10. We see how desireable and acceptable his last visitation should be to us, <HI>John</HI> 14. 3,18. <HI>&amp;</HI> 16. 22. 11.

<P>We are now come to the last Branch of the XVIII. Note, which is this, <HI>That Christ Jesus takes it very kindly at our hands, when he come unto his imprisoned ones.</HI></P>
<P>For opening of which, let me shew, 1. How it does ap|pear that he takes this so kindly. 2. Why he does it. 3. The Uses.</P>
<P>For the first: It does appear that <HI>He takes it very kindly when men come unto his Saint<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters"> prison;</HI> 1. In that his im|prisoned Saints cray for them and their houses, 2 <HI>Tim:</HI> 1. 16,17,18. which is a pledge that he takes it kindly from them. 2. In that they have their lives given them as a prey for this thing, <HI>Jer:</HI> 28. 7,8,9. with 39. 16,17,18. 3. In that he restores such from sickness to health, <HI>Phil:</HI> 2. 25,27. which is a pledge of the Lords kinde acceptance of it. 4. In that he would have such received with all gladness, <HI>Phil:</HI> 2. 29. 5. In that he would have such held in reputation, <HI>ibid.</HI> 6. In that he imparts some Spiritual blessing to them by the Prisoners means, by their savoury and gracious communication, <HI>Acts</HI> 16. 31,32. 7. In that he blesseth them with off spring of their bodies, which had none before; as the Keepers wife with whom Dr. <HI>Sands</HI> was Prisoner, being kinde to him, had a Son the next year, according as he told her. 8. In that he takes such with their families into his Covenant, as we see in the Jaylor that was kinde to <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Silas, Acts</HI> 16 33, 34. 9. In that he fills them with joy in believing, <HI>Acts</HI> 16. 34. 10. In that he records the courtesies that have been shewn to his Prisoners in his own book; the Keepers courtesie to <HI>Joseph, Gen.</HI> 39. Ebedmel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">chs to <HI>Jeremiah, Jer.</HI> 38. 7,8,9. So <HI>Acts</HI> 27. 1,3.</P>
<P>Q. 2. <HI>Why does he take it so kindly?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ans</HI> 1. From himself. 2. From them. 3. From the work itself.</P>
<P><HI>From himself.</HI> 1. He is kinde to his Prisoners, and there|fore takes kindly what is done in kindness to them. 2. He comes to Prisoners himself, and chears them, as he did to

<HI>Paul, Acts</HI> 16. 25,26. and to <HI>Cuthbert Simpson</HI> in Q. <HI>Maries</HI> time. 3.

He desires mercy, and delights in it, <HI>Hos.</HI> 6. 6. <HI>Micah</HI> 7. 18. 6. He looseth the Prisoners, <HI>Psal.</HI> 146. 7. and therefore takes it kindly when we come to them.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>From them.</HI> 1. They are his choyce Worthies, of whom the world is not worthy, <HI>Heb:</HI> 11. 36,38. 2. They are among the most honourable of his believing ones. <HI>Phil:</HI> 1. 29. 3. They are willing to be bound for him, <HI>Acts</HI> 21. 13. 4. They rejoyce that they are counted worthy so to be, <HI>Acts</HI> 5. 41.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>From the work it self.</HI> 1. It is the work of Christ, <HI>Phil:</HI> 2. 30. and therefore no wonder if he does so kindly take it. 2. It is an act of spiritual fortitude and true va|lour, <HI>Phil:</HI> 2. 25. 3. It is an act of true love both to Christ and the Prisoners. 4. It is an act of greatest self denial, <HI>Phil:</HI> 2. 30. <HI>Rom:</HI> 16. 3,4.</P>
<P><HI>Use</HI> 1. <HI>for Information:</HI> 1. We see that though Prisoners be alone, and hardly used, yet Christ hath regard to them, for he owns what is done to them in way of kindness, as done to himself. 2. We see with what acceptance we should receive his kindness to us, in coming to us when we were every moment in danger of being cast into the Prison of Hell. Oh! we should take this kindly at his hands, <HI>Isa:</HI> 42. 6,7. 3. We see what a mercy it is, and how kindly we should take it from him, when he comes to our Spirits when shut up, and sets them at liberty, <HI>Psal:</HI> 88. 8. 4. We see what great encouragement we have to be kind to Christs Prisoners, for he owns and accepts it kindly at our hands, <HI>Heb:</HI> 13. 3. 5. We see that he will much more take it kindly if any of us be instruments to let go those that have been Prisoners of darkness. 6. We see, if coming to Prisoners of Christ be so acceptable to him, how acceptable is it to be a means of their inlargement, and to venture hard for it, as <HI>Rom.</HI> 16. 3,4. 7. We see of what an amiable nature and sweet spirit the Lord Jesus is, that takes a walk to his Prisoners so kindly. 8. We see that we need not be much discouraged to go to Prison for Christs sake 9. We see that if he respect his Prisoners so, Oh how will he respect them in his Pallace of Glory! 10. We see that they that commit his Saints to Prison, do them a greater kindness then they are aware of.</P>

<P>Ver. 37. <HI>Then shall the righteous answer him, saying,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Doct&punc;</HI> XIX. is this <HI>That they that are of a true merciful spirit to the Saints of Christ in their afflicted estate, are in a justified estate.</HI> They are righteous ones, <HI>Psal.</HI> 1129. <HI>Isa.</HI> 57. 1. 2 <HI>Cor</HI> 9. 9,10.</P>
<P>For opening of which, let me shew, 1. How it does ap|pear that they are in a justified estate, or righteous, as they are here styled. 2. Why it must needs be so. 3. The Uses.</P>
<P>For the first: It does appear that <HI>they are in a justified estate, or righteous:</HI> 1. In that Mercy is a fruit of Righte|ousness 2. <HI>Cor:</HI> 9. 10 <HI>Phil:</HI> 1. 11. <HI>Psal:</HI> 37 21. 2. In that it is a mark of Election, <HI>Coloss.</HI> 3. 12, and Elect ones are justi|fied ones, <HI>Rom.</HI> 8. 30. 3. In that it is a pledge of our hap|piness, <HI>Prov</HI> 14. 21.

In that it makes us little to God, <HI>Luke</HI> 6. 36. and none can bear his image but justified <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">. 9. In that mercy argues the goodness of a mans condition, <HI>Psal.</HI> 37. 23,26. and no man can be called a good man, but he that is in a justified estate. 10.

<P>Q. 2. <HI>Why must it needs be so, that they that are of a mer|ciful spirit are in a justified estate?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> 1. Because it is a fruit of Faith, by which alone we are justified, <HI>Rom.</HI> 5. 1. 2. Because it is a fruit of that wisdome that cometh from above&punc; <HI>Jam:</HI> 3. 17. 3. Because it is that that God is well pleased with, <HI>Heb:</HI> 13. 16. <HI>Mice</HI> 6. 8. 4. Because it is that that is the stability of a Chri|stian, <HI>Isac</HI> 32. 8. 5. Because <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> is that that is a mans exal|tation and honour, <HI>Psal</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">. 9. A mans Justification is so, <HI>Duke</HI> 18. 14. 6. Because it is that whereby when we die we enter into peace, <HI>Isa.</HI> 57. 1,2. 7. Because it is that that Christ will own at the last day. 8. Because it is that that evidenceth the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of our Religion, <HI>Jam.</HI> 1. 27.</P>
<P><HI>Use</HI> 1. <HI>for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">:</HI> 1.

We see how unwearied we should be in doing good, and shewing mercy, for there is not a better argument of our integrity and righteousness then that is, <HI>Gol</HI> 6 9. 4.

We see that all they that do not bring forth fruits of mercy and good works, whatever pretence they make, or whatever they say of their Faith, yet they are not justified in the fight of God, <HI>Jam.</HI> 2. 6. We see how good the Lord is to those that the Lord is pleased to bestow a spirit of mercy upon; he gives them in a comfortable pledge of their justified estate. 7. We see who they be that Churches may safely admit into their Fellowship: if we see men and women of a merciful spirit, we may with|out fear admit them, for this argues a justified state.

He is above all our services; that which is spoken of one, is true of all the rest, <HI>Nehem.</HI> 9. 5. and being so above them, we may well wonder that he will accept of them 3. He was happy from all Eternity, when there was neither Man nor Angel to serve him, <HI>Prov.</HI> 8 30, 31. and therefore they may well admire at this. 4. He fills all in&punc; all, <HI>Ephes.</HI> 1.23. <HI>Joh.</HI> 1.16. and is it not then a wonder that he should own and accept any thing done by us? 5. He gives us that whereof we have been bountiful, 1 <HI>Chron.</HI> 29.14,16. 6.

We see that Christ and his Elect ones are one; so he makes account that sayes, <HI>Inasmuch,</HI> &amp;c. Oh what an honour and dignity is this! 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 6. 17. 7.

Sins of Omission burt others oftentimes as well as a mans selfe.

Sins of Omission are fruits of <HI>Adams</HI> Transgression, as well as sins of Com|mission; and that sin of <HI>Adam</HI> imputed damns all, <HI>Rom.</HI> 5. 12. 10.

<P><HI>Doct.</HI> XXXVI. is this, <HI>That Unmercifulness to Christs Members, when hungry and athirst, when Strangers, Naked, Sick and in Prison, shall be deeply charged upon wicked men at the last and great day.</HI></P>
<P>I shall handle the several Branches asunder, as I did before: and first begin with <HI>Unmercifulness to hungry and thirsty ones.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Reasons</HI> why this shall be so deeply charged upon them at that day. 1. From the Nature of Hunger and Thirst. 2. From the Saints, whom they are unmerciful to in their hunger and thirst.</P>
<P>First, <HI>From the Nature of Hunger and Thirst.</HI> 1. Hunger and Thirst both are intolerable evils, if come to the extre|mity of them, they are of a killing nature; <HI>Jeremiah</HI> was like to die with hunger, <HI>Jer.</HI> 38. 9. and <HI>Samson</HI> with thirst, <HI>Judg.</HI> 15. 18. and to be unmerciful to those that are in this case, is murther in an high degree; and therefore may well be charged home upon such at that day as are guilty of it. 2. Hunger and thirst bring a long and lingring deaths along with them, <HI>Lam.</HI> 4. 9. and the longer and more lingring the death is, the more painful and sore it is: it is to die many deaths; and therefore it is that Famine is not called <HI>in Arrow,</HI> as the Pestilence is that kills quickly, <HI>Psal</HI> 91. 5. but it is called <HI>Arrows,</HI> and <HI>Evil Arrows,</HI> Ezek. 5. 16. as if there were many deaths in it. Now to inflict many deaths upon the Members of Christ, and to let them die wounded
<PB N="127" REF="000094_0140_0FA019FF3547E868">
with so many arrows, that's great unmercifulness indeed; and therefore such may well have that sin charged home upon them at that day. 3. Hunger and thirst in the ex|tremity of them, will make men and women unnatural to those they love most, yea sometimes to themselves, <HI>Deut.</HI> 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">,53&mdash;57. 2 <HI>Kings</HI> 6. 28,29. <HI>Law.</HI> 2. 20 <HI>&amp;</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">. 10. <HI>Ezek</HI> 5. 10. Now to refuse to give meat to them that are hungry, and drink to the thirsty, is to put them upon un|natural courses, if God were not more merciful to them: and this sin must needs be charged upon them at that day. 4. Hunger and thirst make men look pale and ghastly, and so is to move men to pity. Now to be unmerciful to such whose countenances bespeak pity and compassion, that must needs be a sin that Christ will charge home at that day. 5. Hunger and Thirst-exhaust the very spirits, as 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 30. 11,12. Now to refuse to give to those meat and drink, who are almost expiring, and breathing out their last, is great cruelty. 6. Hunger and thirst are warl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">e weapons <HI>Ezek.</HI> 5. 16. weapons of Destruction: Now if men may keep off such things from their Brethren, and will not, it is great unmercifulness, and therefore will be heavily charged upon them at that day.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>From the Saints themselves.</HI> 1. They would bless them with their Prayers, if relieved, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>Tim.</HI> 1. 16. 2. They would procure the Lord to be their debtor, <HI>Prov.</HI> 19. 17. if succoured. 3. They would bring a blessing upon their Posterity and Families, 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 1. 16,17,18. 4. They would procure mercy for them at that day, <HI>ibid.</HI> 5. They would receive them into everlasting habitations, <HI>Luk.</HI> 16. 9. 6. They would bring in more to them in outwards then they take from them, <HI>Prov.</HI> 11. 24,25. 7. They would feast them with Spiritual <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">: Now to be unmerciful to such, in not giving them meat and drink, must needs be charged home upon them at that day.</P>
<P><HI>Use</HI> 1. <HI>for Information:</HI> 1. We see a reason why un|merciful men are so unwilling to die, and to think of the Day of Judgement; they know that that sin of Unmerci|fulness will be charged home upon them at that day. 2.

We see how loathsome that sin should be to us, and how fearful we should be to fall into it. 4. We see what severity they must look for, that take away meat from the hungry, and drink form the thirsty. 5. We see that unmerciful men shall not want Witnesses to some in against them; rather then so, the hungry Bellies

We see that unmercifulness, though it be not known to men, yet it is to the Lord, and he will one day reckon for it. 8. We see the truth of that in <HI>Prov.</HI> 11. 17. <HI>The merciful man doth good to his own soul; but he that is cruel, troubleth his own flesh.</HI> 9. We see now exceedingly the Lord abhors a covetous unmerciful spirit, <HI>Psal.</HI> 10. 3. 10. We see how tenderly careful the Lord is of the Bodies and lives of his Saints, that will charge it so home to them at that day, that have not fed them. 11.

It is want of Humanity; such men do un-Man themselves, forget that they are men: now to be without Humanity, so far to degenerate as to loss the nature of man, must needs be deeply charged upon men at that day. 2. It is want of natural affection, which is an Heathenish sin, <HI>Rom</HI> 1. 31. and that is very unbesceming Christianity. 3. It is a manifest breach of Rule, 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 4. 9. <HI>Heb.</HI> 13. 2. and how then should it be otherwise, but that it should be charged home upon those that are guilty of it? 4.

It is worse then Bar|barism <HI>Act.</HI> 28. 2,7,10. 8. It is that that is very pro|voking to the spirits of good men <HI>Luke</HI> 9. 51,52,53,54. and though they were too hot, which Christ rebukes them for, yet the sin was great, and very provoking, although the sweet disposition of Christ would not then punish it. 9. It is a confluence of many sins, and the very sink that they come from, and run into, Pride, Covetousness, Careles|ness, Senslesness of others conditions, Barrenness, Unchari|tableness, Unbeleif, and these the Lord abhors. 10.

<P>The Third Branch of the XXXVI. <HI>Doctrine</HI> is this, <HI>That unmercifulness in not clothing Christs naked Members, shall be deeply charged upon the Wicked at the last and great Day.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Reasons:</HI> 1. From the Nature of this sin. 2. From the Saints who are in this Condition. 3. The Uses.</P>
<P>First, <HI>From the Nature of this Sin:</HI> 1. It is that that ex|poseth them to perishing, <HI>Job</HI> 31. 19. and thereby such are guilty of Murther, and therefore it is no wonder if Christ will so deeply charge it upon wicked men at the last day. 2. If it should not rise so high as Murther, yet it exposeth them to suffer much by reason of cold, which sometimes is so extream that it cannot be born, <HI>Psal</HI> 147. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">. and the extremity of cold causeth many sicknesses, some of which are as painful, and bitter as death it self: see <HI>Job</HI> 24. 7. 2. <HI>Cor.</HI> 11. 27. 3. If neither of these should come, yet it expo|seth the Saints to uncomeliness; for to be naked, and desti|tute of clothing, is very uncomely: and the Lord would

have us go comely, &amp; looks at it as a sin in those that cause others to go naked <HI>Job</HI> 24. 10. 4. It is that that godly men reprove in those that they think are guilty of it, <HI>Job</HI> 22. 6. It's true, <HI>Eliphaz</HI> missed the mark, when he charged <HI>Job</HI> with this; but yet it holds out, that he thought he was guilty, and chargeth it home upon him. Much more will Christ charge it deeply upon them that he knows to be guilty, at that day. 5. It is Inhumanity; and God would have us, as in other cases, to shew our selves men, <HI>Isa.</HI> 46. 8. 6. It is contrary to the Rule of the Gospel, <HI>Luke</HI> 3. 11. 7. It comes cross to the practice of the Saints, 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 28. 15. <HI>Job</HI> 31. 19. <HI>Acts</HI> 10. 39. 8. It breaks the Law of Love, <HI>Rom.</HI> 13. 10. 9. It spoils the most Spiritual of all our Duties, <HI>Isa.</HI> 58. 3,4,6,7. 10. It is an Abomination to the Lord, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 18. 13. and therefore no wonder if he charge it so home upon the wicked at that day.</P>

<P>The Fourth Branch of the XXXVI. Doctrine, is this.</P>
<P><HI>That un<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">trcifulness to Christs sick Members in not vi|siting them, shall be deeply charged upon the wicked at the last and great Day.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Reasons.</HI> 1. From the Nature of the Sin. 2. From the Saints in that condition.</P>
<P><HI>From the Nature of this sin.</HI> 1. It argues that such men have forsaken the fear of the Almighty, <HI>Job</HI> 6. 14. and there|fore it is no wonder that such shal be charged with it at that day. 2. It argues that such men are not sensible of the afflicted estate of such sick ones, and that's a manifest breach of Rule, <HI>ibid.</HI> 3. It argues that such men restrain Prayer before God, when they refuse to visit sick ones: for sick ones have need of Prayers to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">eade for them, <HI>Jam.</HI> 5. 4. It argues that such men do not consider their own latter end; for their very going to such an house of Mourning, would put them upon it to think of their own death; <HI>Eccles.</HI> 7. 2. 5. It argues that they have no love to the Brethren, for love would come off with a visit chearfully, and willingly, 1 <HI>John</HI> 3. 18. 6. It argues that they care not what becomes of others, so it go well with them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> And that they are exceeding lovers of themselves, 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 3. 2. 7. It argues a slighting of the hand of God upon others; and a forgetting that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"></P>

It argues want of love to God, 1 <HI>John</HI> 4. 20. 9. It argues a covetous heart; for therefore they refrain vi|siting, because they would give nothing so them, and see <HI>Nekem.</HI> 13. 1,2. 10. It argues that they dream of the Continuance of their own healths, and that they shall not be sick.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>From the Saints in that condition.</HI> 1. They cannot help themselves; and to deny a visit to such, must needs he great Cruelty. 2. They need visiting for the comfort both of outward and inward man; and we are bound to attend both, 1 <HI>Thess.</HI> 5. 14. 3. They do even beg of pity, <HI>Job</HI> 19. 21. and to be denied pity when they desire it of us, is sad, and will be reckoned for. 4. They are such as the hand of God has touched, <HI>Job</HI> 9. 21. and therefore we should be touched with the sense of their condition. 5. They are lonesome and disconsolate, and cannot well want company. 6. They are such as Satan is apt to take advantage against; for when the Saints are most alone, and weakest, then he bestirs himself most, <HI>Gen.</HI> 3. 1,2. 7. They
<PB N="135" REF="000094_0148_0FA01A08BA5522D0">
are such as God sometimes withdraws himself from, as he did from <HI>Hezekiah,</HI> Isa. 38. 13. 8. They mourn in that condition, <HI>Isa.</HI> 38. 14. and to be denied a visit at such a time, as it is grievous to them, so the Lord cannot but reckon for it.</P>
<P><HI>Use</HI> 1. <HI>for Information:</HI> 1. We see that the Lord has respect to his sick Saints, and dearly tenders them himself, seeing he will charge it so home upon wicked men at the last day, that they have not visited them in that condition. 2. We see that if they that visit not Christs sick Members shall be so severely judged, Oh what will be the condition of those that are glad at such a Calamity, and hope they shall never come out of it! <HI>Psal</HI> 41. 8. <HI>&amp;</HI> 35. 15. 3. We see what need such men have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o repent of such unmerciful|ness, and to charge this sin upon themselves, by confessing and bewailing it, that they may not be charged with it at that day. 4. We see that Sickness are no arguments of Gods rejecting of his Saints, for he is tender of them in that condition, and cannot endure that any should be hard|hearted toward them. 5. We see a reason why God orders it in his Providence, that such shall not be visited them|selves when sick: for he distastes them so, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> will charge it upon them at that day. And this is a token of his displeasure against them. 6. We see that surely such as are sick of love for Christ <HI>Cant.</HI> 5. 8. shall be very much tendred by them, and he will not endure that any should be cruel to them. 7. We see how careful we should be so enquire who are sick amongst us, and go and visit them, as ever we desire to escape this severe charge of the Lord Jesus at the last and great day. 8. We see that all such as have been guilty of this sin, must needs be troubled in their Consciences for it, when they think seriously of it; for it will be charged home upon them at the last and great day. 9. We see what need we had to look after those that are sick of sin, and to tender convinced sinners, as Christ does. <HI>Mat.</HI> 9. 11,12. 10. We see that if the non visitation of sick ones will be so deeply charged upon men at that day, then surely cruelty to sick ones in other kinds much more.</P>

<P>Ver. 43. <HI>Sick, and in Prison, and ye visited me not.</HI></P>
<P>We are now come to the last Branch of the XXXVI.</P>
<P>Doctrine, and that is this, <HI>That unmercifulness to Christs imprisoned ones, shall be deeply charged upon the Wicked at the last and great Day.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Reasons.</HI> 1. From the nature of this sin. 2. From the Saints in this condition.</P>
<P>First, <HI>From the Nature of this sin of not visiting Christs Prisoner:</HI> 1. It is an high contempt of Christ himselfe, for he saves, <HI>he is in Prison when they are;</HI> and will not such a sin be charged home at that day? 2. It is great hard|heartedness and cruelty; For no men in the world need more pitty then sometimes Prisoners do; they endure great trials, <HI>Heb.</HI> 11. 36. <HI>Rev.</HI> 2. 10. and this is a great plague, <HI>Exod</HI> 9. 14. to be hard-hearted. 3. It is inhumanity; and such a sin whereby men put off humanity, must needs be charged deeply upon them at that day. 4. It is worse then Barbarism; for even Barbarians have been kind to some of the Lord's Prisoners, as to <HI>Paul,</HI> when he was a Prisoner, <HI>Acts.</HI> 28,2,10. 5. It is worse then Heathenism; for some Heathens have been kinde to the Lords Prisoners; as we see in <HI>Iosephs</HI> Keeper, <HI>Gen.</HI> 39. 21. so <HI>Acts</HI> 28. 2,16,31. 6. It is that by which men resemble the very Devil; for he casts the Saints into Prison, <HI>Rev.</HI> 2. 10. and would have them there to have no mercy. 7. It is altogether inconsistent with
<PB N="137" REF="000094_0150_0FA01A0A37823868">
the love of God, 1 <HI>Job.</HI> 3. 17. 8. It is a Trangression of that Commandment that we have from God, that <HI>He who loveth God, love his Brother also,</HI> 1 <HI>Iab.</HI> 4. 21. 9. It is that that is de|testable to God, Angels, and all good men: for all these visit these Prisoners, <HI>Gen.</HI> 39. 21. <HI>Act.</HI> 12. 6,7,8. 10. It is that that a man will loath himself for, if ever he repent, <HI>Acts</HI> 16. 33</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>From the Saints in that condition:</HI> 1. They are in a lonesome condition, and therefore stand in need visiting. 2. They are under manifold temptations; and others visits would help them in such a condition. 3. They are sorrow|ful; we read of the sighs of Prisoners, <HI>Psal.</HI> 79. 11. and others visits would help to alleviate those sighs. 4. They are dying men, <HI>Psal.</HI> 79. 11. and not to visit dying men must needs be charged upon those that are guilty of it. 5. They are meanly provided for in the Prison, 1 <HI>Kin.</HI> 22. 26,27. and not to visit them, to minister something more com|fortable for them for their Diet, is sad, and will be reckon|ed for. 5. They have mean Lodging; many times a little straw, or it may be a Pair of Stocks, <HI>Acts</HI> 16. 24. 7. They are sometimes pined, and have no meat at all, <HI>Jer</HI> 38. 9. 8. They are starved with cold; as Mr. <HI>Latimer.</HI> 9. They are tortured sometimes, <HI>Heb.</HI> 11. 35. 10. They continue long in this condition.</P>
<P><HI>Use</HI> 1. <HI>for Information:</HI> 1. We see that the Lords Pri|soners are very dear to him, in that he will charge unmerci|full ones so deeply at that day, for not visiting them in this their afflicted condition. 2. We see that he will surely charge it home upon them, that have without cause put them into Prison, and have dealt cruelly with them there, by Pining, Starving, Torturing of them. 3. We see that surely the death of such Prisoners is very precious in his sight. If the death of every Saint be precious, <HI>Psal.</HI> 116. 15. then much more precious is the death of these Saints, that are Sufferers for him, 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 4. 6, 16. He will charge the wicked's not visiting them, upon them; and therefore when they shed their Blood, it shall be costly to them: He will have a price for that Blood. 4. We see that the Saints may be content to be put in Prison, and to suffer the Cruelty that sometimes they there meet with; for Christ takes notice of it, and will deeply charge it upon unmerciful ones. 5. We see that the closest Prisons can|not exclude Christ, nor shut out his love from his Pri|soners, <HI>Rom.</HI> 8. 38,39. 6. We see that if there he so much iniquity in a non-visit of Christs Prisoners, that it shall be so charged; Oh what is there in the Slaughter of so many as have been stain for Jesus sake in all Ages! 7. We see
<PB N="138" REF="000094_0151_0FA01A0BE0AA1368">
that the worst state of the People of the Lord, even a Pri|son-condition, is better then the best of hard hearted wicked men, for these last must be accountable for their Neglects of poor Prisoners. 8. We see that omissions of small kind|nesses to men in misery, though we think not of them as any great matter, yet will be made so<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ething of a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> that day. 9. We see how dear such must pay for it, that have been and are of the Romish Religion, <HI>Rev.</HI> 18. 24. 10. We see that Prisoners for Jesus sake, though not visited by some men, yet have many a sweet visit from him, for he will make up their defect.</P>
<P><HI>Use</HI> 2. <HI>for Terrour:</HI> 1. To those that visit not, 2. To those that visit them to punish them. 3. To those that kill them in Prison. 4. To those that make their life worse then death.</P>

<P><HI>To Prisoners:</HI> 1. To bear patiently their Imprison|ment, with all the miseries attending that condition: their enemies shall pay dear for them. 2. To be content with that lonesome condition, and to be without mens visits. 3. To desire more of the Lords visits. 4. To be thankful when the Lord visits them.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>To others.</HI> 1. To visit the Lords Prisoners, for it will be sad with them that do it not. 2. To abhorre their Cruelty, that use them cruelly and barbarously there. 3. To pity their Tormentors, they must pay for it. 4. To rejoyce if we should be called to it, <HI>Acts.</HI> 16. 25.</P>

<P><HI>Doct.</HI> XXXVII. is this, <HI>That wicked men would fain ex|cuse their Unmercifulness to the Saints, but their ex|cusing of themselves shall be of no avail for them.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Reasons.</HI> 1. Why they would excuse their unmerciful|ness at that day. 2. Why their excusing themselves shall be of no avail for them.</P>
<P>For the first: <HI>They would Excuse themselves</HI> 1. From the Pride of their hearts, whereby they think better of
<PB N="139" REF="000094_0152_0FA01A0BED07E4A0">
their estate then it is: for Pride will frame excuses; as it was with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> he had a good conceit of his doings, and therefore made and excuse after another, to justifie himself before the Lord and <HI>Samuel,</HI> in the matter of destroying the <HI>Amal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">kites,</HI> 1 <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> 15. 13,14,15,20,21. So it will be with these at the last day. 2. From the Boldness and Au|daciousness of their spirits. A bold audacious fellow, though he be guilty of some foul fact, yet will frame many excuses, to do what he can to clear himself before <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> so these, from a hold spirit, will frame excuses before the great Judge. 2. From that wisdome that is in them to do evil, <HI>J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">r.</HI> 4. 22. they have a natural subtilty in them, to have something to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> in way of excuse for themselves, and this subtilty they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> at that day. 4. From the shift|ing spirit that is and will then appear in such; they would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> out of his hand, and shift off; the bloves that are coming upon them <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> 27. 22. 5.

So the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">. 6. From the self-flattery that is in them, <HI>Psal.</HI> 26. 12. 7.

From the dreadfulness of the Judgement that is passed upon them, they would fun say something to excuse themselves. 9. From the stifling of their Consciences; for then Conscience will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">cuse. 10. From their Hypocrisie, which makes them feign excuses.</P>
<P>Q. 2. <HI>Why shall their excusing of themselves be of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> avoid in them at that day?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> 1. From the Judge. 2. From the Wicked.</P>
<P><HI>From the Judge.</HI> 1. He is Wise, and knows how to take off their silly Excuses, <HI>Prov.</HI> 8. 1. <HI>Jude</HI> ver. 25. 2.
