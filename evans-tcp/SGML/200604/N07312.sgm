<HEAD>The <HI>Argument.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>FLorio</HI> and <HI>Albinus,</HI> two young Gentlemen of good Edu|cation, and Admirers of the Decea&s;ed, had retired for <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span">. In a plea&s;ant Morning Walk, they chance to meet on the &s;ummit of a gently ri&s;ing Hill; their mutual Salutation, introduces a &s;hort Di&s;cour&s;e on the Beauties of the Country which is &s;uddenly interrupted by the Sight of a Tree which had been &s;hattered by the Lightning. Admiration of the <HI>Phaenomenon</HI> gives Occa&s;ion to <HI>Florio</HI> to communicate to his Friend the News of a far more awful and &s;urprizing <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> of Providence, in the Removal of their once beloved and worthy Pa&s;tor by Death. <HI>Albinus</HI> is &s;urprized, but recollecting a remarkable Dream, emble|matical of the Occurrence he relates it to <HI>Florio,</HI> who full of Grief laments the Life of &s;o great and good a Man; while <HI>Albinus</HI> repre&s;ents the infinite Advantage to him&s;elf by the Change, and his Admi&s;&s;ion into the Society of the Ble&s;&s;ed: After which they join in a &s;acred Ode, expre&s;&s;ive of their Re&s;ignation to divine Providence.</P>
