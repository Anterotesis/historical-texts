Nevertheless, we are C<HI>ertain</HI> that <HI>several</HI> of his Chil|dren prov'd <HI>Godly Persons;</HI> and it is <HI>Likely</HI> enough that <HI>the most</HI> of them did so. But most of all Happy was <HI>David,</HI> in his Beloved and Renowned Son <HI>Solomon;</HI> whose Inspired <HI>Books,</HI> in the <HI>Language</HI> whereof he much follow|ed, but in the <HI>Number</HI> thereof, Exceed|ed his <HI>Father,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> him to have bin, <HI>An Holy Man of God.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Solomon</HI> himself had but <HI>One Son</HI> that we Read of; and <HI>He</HI> too was None of the Best.

[Ecel. 2. 13, 19.] Now 'twas very much for the Caution of that <HI>One Son,</HI> that he Wrote those <HI>Ex|cellent Proverbs,</HI> wherein we <HI>all</HI> Enjoy him and Admire him, as the true, <HI>Master

<P>The <HI>Text</HI> before you, is the first of those <HI>Proverbs:</HI> and I make no doubt, that <HI>Solomon</HI> had his own, Only, Silly <HI>Son,</HI> in his Eye, when he Wrote it; the first part of the Text, his <HI>Father</HI> had fulfilled in <HI>Himself;</HI> the last part of the Text, <HI>Himself</HI> had fulfilled in <HI>Reheboam.</HI> The <HI>Gladness</HI> of a <HI>Father,</HI> over a <HI>Wise Son,</HI> and the <HI>Sadness</HI> of a <HI>Mather,</HI> over a <HI>Foolish</HI> One, is in this <HI>Proverb</HI> Declared; Nevertheless, the <HI>Gladness</HI> of the <HI>Mother</HI> as well as the <HI>Father,</HI> over the <HI>Wise Son,</HI> and the <HI>Sadness</HI> of the <HI>Father</HI> as well as the <HI>Mother,</HI> over the <HI>Foolish</HI> One, is herein Implied. In the Concise <HI>Proverbs</HI> here, there is usually an <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">,</HI> to be so Compared, that something not <HI>Expressed,</HI> is to be fetch'd and learn't from each part as plainly to be <HI>understood.</HI> Yea, the <HI>Daughter</HI> as well as the <HI>Son,</HI> is herein also Compre|hended.
<PB N="8" REF="000723_0009_0FAA445EDE2A88C0">
But yet it may be worth while to Enquire, Why 'tis rather the Gladness of the <HI>Father</HI> than of the <HI>Mother,</HI> that is here mentioned upon the <HI>Wise Child?</HI> Unto this I answer; 'Tis because the <HI>Father</HI> ordinarily has most <HI>Share</HI> in procuring, and most <HI>Sense</HI> in perceiving, the <HI>Wisdom</HI> of his Children. When Children are come to such <HI>Ma|turity,</HI> that their <HI>Wisdom</HI> does become Observable, ordinarily the <HI>Mother</HI> has more dismissed them from her Conver|sation, that the <HI>Father</HI> has from <HI>his:</HI> and the <HI>Father</HI> is many wayes more capable of the Joyful Resentments, ari|sing from the <HI>Wisdom</HI> of <HI>His,</HI> I say, <HI>His,</HI> Well Educated Children appearing now abroad in the World: the Child is now more Emphatically become, an <HI>Abner,</HI> that is to say, <HI>The Father Light;</HI> or, an <HI>Abigail,</HI> that is to say, <HI>The Fathers Joy.</HI> But if you will go on to Enquire, Why 'tis rather the Sadness of the <HI>Mo|ther,</HI> than of the <HI>Father</HI> that is mentioned upon the <HI>Foolish Child?</HI> Unto this I answer; 'Tis because when Children miscarry, the <HI>Mother</HI> is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> most B<HI>lamed</HI> for <HI>It:</HI> People will be most ready to say, and very <HI>Often</HI> say, it very <HI>Justly</HI> too, <HI>'Twas <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> of them, that betray'd them into the Sinful

It may likewise be, Because when Children Turn Impious, the <HI>Mother,</HI> is many times more impatient of it, than the <HI>Father</HI> is. 'Twas <HI>Rebeckah,</HI> rather than <HI>Isaac,</HI> that was <HI>Weary of her Life,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> a Child married against their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> if the Child <HI>Sin</HI> at home, <HI>She</HI> sees <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> most of it; it abroad, <HI>She</HI> bears <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> worst of it; and so <HI>She</HI> becomes most <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> uneasy at i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">.</P>
<P>I suppose you take it for grant|ed, that the <HI>Godly</HI> Son, is the <HI>Wise</HI> One; for 'tis that Child alone, that is, <HI>The Child Wise unto Salvation:</HI> and the very <HI>First</HI> Advice of the <HI>Wise</HI> man, which we have in the Introduction unto the <HI>Proverbs</HI> is, <HI>That the Fear of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> is the principal print of knowledge:</HI> in which Advice, we find his <HI>Father,</HI> ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> long before instructed him.

<P>What is to be said for the <HI>Counsil</HI> and <HI>Comfort</HI> of Godly PARENTS Afflicted <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>Ungodly Children?</HI></P>
<P><HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> Children,</HI> are all without the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> Symptoms</HI> of <HI>Regeneration</HI> upon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">; all such as do more mind the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> this World, than the <HI>Great Salvation</HI> of their Souls; all such as continue in a <HI>Careless.

<P>If: any of you are Afflicted with and for, such miserable <HI>Children,</HI> Let these Lessons be acceptable to you.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="11" REF="000723_0012_0FAA4461279C32A0">
I. Though you are <HI>Afflicted</HI> with <HI>Un|godly Children,</HI> you must not be discou|raged as if you were altogether <HI>Singu|lar,</HI> in your <HI>Affliction. Godly Parents</HI> are full of <HI>Lamentations,</HI> over their <HI>Ungodly Children;</HI> and among the rest of their <HI>Lamentations,</HI> they often make <HI>That,</HI> in Lam. 1. 12. <HI>Behold, and See, if there be any Sorrow like unto my Sorrow, which is done unto me, wherewith the Lord has Afflicted me, in the Day of his Fierce Anger.</HI> They conclude, that among the <HI>Children</HI> of God, there are none puni|shed with such <HI>Ungodly Children,</HI> and they suspect whether they be themselves indeed the <HI>Children</HI> of God, and not themselves <HI>Ungodly:</HI> Why? Because th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>Fierce Anger</HI> of God, appears in their <HI>Affliction.</HI> But you are very much mi|staken! There are many <HI>Godly Parents,</HI> whose Children have given them cause to complain, like that Worthy Minister, who Printing a Little Book, Entituled, <HI>Parents Groans over their Wicked Children,</HI> Dedicated it unto his <HI>own Children,</HI> with these grievous words, <HI>There are some of you that have made me the Father of Fools.</HI> There is an <HI>Italian</HI> saying well|known, which intimates, That the man was not Born of <HI>Mankind,</HI> whose Fami|ly

has no <HI>Blemishes</HI> akin unto it. Even so, If in a <HI>Family</HI> of many <HI>Children,</HI> there should be some <HI>Ungodly</HI> One to <HI>Blemish</HI> it, this is a Thing whereof I may say, <HI>'Tis Nothing but what is com|mon to man.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis true, That the Eternal <HI>Election</HI> of God, most generally falls upon the Children of <HI>Godly Parents.</HI> We read in Psal. 103. 17. <HI>The Merey of the Lord is from Everlasting to Everlasting, upon them that Fear Him, and His Righteousness unto Childrens Children.</HI> Though they are not <HI>only,</HI> yet they are <HI>chiefly,</HI> the Children of <HI>Godly Parents,</HI> whom the Lords <HI>E|verlasting</HI> Purposes of <HI>Mercy</HI> take notice of. The Line of <HI>Election,</HI> does general|ly run in the <HI>Book of Life,</HI> after that manner, <HI>Mine Elect and their Off spring with them, are the Blessed of the Lord</HI> There are whole <HI>Constellations</HI> of passages in the Bible, which do signifie thus much unto us, That where God has <HI>Chosen</HI> any to <HI>Salvation,</HI> He generally <HI>Chooses</HI> others from the <HI>House</HI> which He has thus graciously begun to Look up|on. And I humbly conceive, that if an Account should now be taken of all that <HI>Fear God</HI> in the World, they would <HI>mostly</HI> appear to have sprung
<PB N="13" REF="000723_0014_0FAA44629D868090">
from the Loins of <HI>God fearing</HI> Ancestors. 'Tis also true, That among the Chil|dren of <HI>Godly Parents,</HI> the <HI>most</HI> by far do Really become, <HI>The Lords</HI> for ever, and go to Heaven, where they shall be, <HI>For ever with the Lord.</HI> We read, in 1 Cor. 7. 14. about the <HI>Children of the Faithful, They are Holy.</HI> The Chil|dren of <HI>Godly Parents,</HI> we are bound in a <HI>Judgment</HI> of <HI>Charity</HI> to reckon, as much belonging unto the Lord, as <HI>Themselves. The most</HI> of them do <HI>Die</HI> in their <HI>Infancy;</HI> and God forbid, that we should imagine a <HI>Believer</HI> to have no better ground of <HI>Hope</HI> for his De|parted Offspring, than an <HI>Infidel.</HI> But of those that <HI>Live</HI> to be <HI>Adult</HI> also, very <HI>many,</HI> if not <HI>The most</HI> come to Serve the <HI>God of their Fathers.</HI> Inso|much, that our Brethren of the <HI>Anti|poedobaptist</HI> Perswasion, have no more Argument against <HI>Infant</HI> B<HI>aptism,</HI> from the <HI>Apostasie</HI> of those whom we B<HI>aptise</HI> in Childhood, than we might have, to speak of those that are B<HI>aptised</HI> in Ri|per Years.

Endeavoured? Being <HI>Afflicted</HI> with <HI>Un|godly Children,</HI> give not ever your <HI>En|deavours</HI> to get the Affliction Cured, in their Conversion unto God.</P>
<P>In the pursuance of this Blessed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> I would in the first place put in a Cau|tion, That you would by no means make your Children <HI>Desperate;</HI> for that will make the <HI>Cure</HI> so.

A Parent like <HI>Saul,</HI> of an Implacable Fury, will be like to Loose <HI>Children</HI> that were as Good as <HI>Jonathan</HI> himself. Alluding to what occurs in the Prophet [Jer. 31. 18, 19, 20.] In the Hottest <HI>Rage</HI> that you may have, against the Offences of an <HI>Ungodly Child,</HI> yet let them if it be possible, a little perceive those workings in your Parental <HI>Bowels; Ever since I spake against him, I earnestly Remember him still; therefore my bowels are Trou|bled

<P>And unto this Caution, I would Im|portunately, add my Entreaty, That you would never suffer your Mouths, no, nor your Minds, to <HI>Curse</HI> your <HI>Children;</HI> for that will be the way, ne|ver to <HI>Cure</HI> them. Whatever Indignati|on may be Raised in <HI>You,</HI> by any Pre|varication of <HI>Theirs,</HI> do not fly out in|to any <HI>In Wishes</HI> concerning them; Your <HI>Ill Wishes</HI> will after an unknown man|ner Commissionate the <HI>Angels of Death</HI> to Execute quick Plagues upon them, which, doubtless, you will afterwards be sorry for.

Thus has the <HI>Sad Case of Godly Pa|rents</HI> afflicted with <HI>Ungodly Children,</HI> been considered. But we may not pass unto what remains, until we have made some <HI>Reflections</HI> upon the B<HI>etter</HI> C<HI>ase</HI> of some other <HI>Godly Parents</HI> which hence arise unto us.</P>
<P>First. A Lesson of <HI>Easiness,</HI> is hence taught unto those that are <HI>Deny'd,</HI> or <HI>Depriv'd</HI> of <HI>Children.</HI> The strongest of all the <HI>Desires,</HI> which God has Implant|ed in the <HI>Nature</HI> of Man, T<HI>o Live after Death with a sort of Jointed Eter|nitie in a Lasting</HI> P<HI>osteritie,</HI> is that, it seems, wherein God has Crossed you. But I am now to tell you, That your Condition in this Thing, is <HI>Easier,</HI> than the Condition of many Godly Persons, who have their <HI>Children</HI> about them. It was denounced as a sore Affliction upon <HI>Jechonias,</HI> in Jer. 22. 30. <HI>Write ye this man Childless.</HI> They that will have the <HI>Salathiel</HI> mentioned in our Lords Genealogy, to be the proper S<HI>on,</HI> of that <HI>Jechonias,</HI> yet a Son who was pre|vented from Succeeding his Father in his Royal State, choose to read it so, <HI>Write this man Desolate, or Distressed.</HI> In|deed, the <HI>Childless,</HI> are <HI>Childishly</HI> enough
<PB N="37" REF="000723_0038_0FAA44D8625619A0">
oftentimes <HI>Distressed,</HI> as if they were <HI>De|solate,</HI> while they have not parts of <HI>Themselves</HI> to Leave their <HI>Name</HI> and their <HI>Wealth</HI> unto. But I can tell you of a worse thing far away than this; <HI>Write ye this man the Parent of Ungodly Chil|dren!</HI> and that is worse a thousand times.</P>
<P>Are you by S<HI>terilitie</HI> Debar'd of <HI>Chil|dren?</HI> The Prophet of God has told you, <HI>That you may have a Name better than of Sons and of Daughters.</HI> If by <HI>Union</HI> with the Lord Jesus Christ, you come to have that Name. <HI>A Child of God,</HI> you have then a <HI>Better Name,</HI> than if you should be called, <HI>The Parent</HI> of never so many <HI>Sons</HI> or <HI>Daughters.</HI> An <HI>Absaloms</HI> Pillar, what is it worth? As for the <HI>Name</HI> of such a <HI>Parent,</HI> it is <HI>Better</HI> to have no such <HI>Name</HI> at all, than to have Wicked S<HI>ons</HI> or <HI>Daughters: They</HI> do all they can, to make your <HI>Name</HI> suffer abroad in the World, and <HI>Rot,</HI> and <HI>Stink,</HI> like their own.

<P>But, Secondly, A Lesson of <HI>Thankful|ness,</HI> is hence taught, unto those that have <HI>Godly Children</HI> It may be, that some of you are Blessed with <HI>Sons</HI> as <HI>Young Plants growing up in their Youth,</HI> with <HI>Daughters</HI> as <HI>Corner Stones polished after the fashion of a Palace,</HI> with <HI>Chil|dren</HI> that are every way Vertuous and Laudable. <HI>These</HI> are <HI>Blessings</HI> indeed, and such <HI>Blessings,</HI> as many Godly Persons go without. Oh Give Thanks to God; and let His <HI>Free Grace</HI> alone, Let not your <HI>Merit,</HI> nor your <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> have the Glory of it. When <HI>David</HI> had a Son Born unto him, which all the People of God, were Like to be the Better for; he sang upon it in Psal. 127. 3, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>Lo, Children</HI> (so qualified) <HI>are an Heritage of the Lord.

When <HI>Israel,</HI> had a <HI>Son,</HI> a <HI>Joseph,</HI> by whom his whole Fami|ly was not only Honoured, but Sustai|ned also; when <HI>Aaron</HI> had a <HI>Son,</HI> an <HI>Eleazar,</HI> whom he saw Ordained unto a Great Service in the Church of God; when <HI>Joab,</HI> had a <HI>Son,</HI> a <HI>Gideon,</HI> whom|he saw bravely testifying against the I dolatries of his Age; And when the Prophet <HI>Isaiah,</HI> had a <HI>Son, Shear jashub,</HI> whom the Lord joined in the same Commission with him, <HI>Go Thou, and thy Son unto the King:</HI> And when the Daugh|ter, though but a Daughter-in law, of <HI>Naomi,</HI> said unto her Godly Mother, <HI>Thy People shall be my People, and thy God shall be my God:</HI> Surely, They had a more than ordinary <HI>Satisfaction</HI> in that

Mr. <HI>Swinneck,</HI> recites a Narrative, of a Yeoman in <HI>Leicestershire,</HI> who made over his House and Land, unto an Un|worthy Son, upon Marriage; Conditio|nally that his Son should keep him, du|ring his Life. But afterwards, there fell out some Difference between them, on which this <HI>Viper</HI> of a Son, bad his Fa|ther, <HI>Get him out of Doors,</HI> and call'd him, <HI>A Bursten Belly Slave,</HI> (as indeed the Old man had a Rupture.) The very next Day, as the Young man was walking in his Grounds, Mr. <HI>Goodman,</HI> the Minister of the Parish, Riding by, ask'd him, <HI>How he did?</HI> He answered, <HI>Very well!</HI> But before the Minister was out of light, the Young mans <HI>Bowels

Gushed out,</HI> and he miserably went home, carrying of them in his hands. He then sent for the Minister, own'd the Justice of God upon him for his Undutifulness unto his Father, and made his Will, wherein he Bequeathed unto his Father much of what he had, and that Night he Dyed.</P>
<P N="5">V. It is now Twenty Years ago, that them was Preached and Printed in this Land, a Sermon, upon that Scripture Eccl. 7, 17. <HI>Be not overmuch Wicked, Why shouldest thou Dy before thy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">?</HI> From whence I will take Leave to Transcribe in this place, the Ensuing Lines.</P>

is a Scripture, which, methinks may strike Terror, and Trembling, into the Souls of <HI>Disobedient Children:</HI> It is that in Prov. 30. 17. T<HI>he Eye that mocketh his Father, and Despiseth to obey his Mo|ther, the Ravens of the Valley shall pick it out, and the young Eagles shall Eat it.</HI> Stubbornness and Contempt is to be seen in the <HI>Eye: The Eye that mocketh his Father,</HI> is, he that is Stubborn and Rebellious against his <HI>Father</HI> Well, A <HI>Father</HI> has many times that Wisdom and Authority, with him, that the Child dare not Disobey <HI>him,</HI> but he careth not for his <HI>Mother:</HI> Therefore 'tis added, <HI>He that Despiseth to obey his Mother.</HI> You Children, that Disobey your <HI>Mothers,</HI> hearken to This!
