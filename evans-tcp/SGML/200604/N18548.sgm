<HEAD>ADVICE TO THE PRIVILEGED ORDERS. INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>THE French Revolution is at la&s;t not only accompli&s;hed, but its accompli&s;hment univer&s;ally acknowledged, beyond contradic|tion abroad, or the power of retraction at home. It has fini&s;hed its work, by organizing a government, on principles approved by rea|&s;on; an object long contemplated by diffe|rent writers, but never before exhibited, in this quarter of the globe. The experiment now in operation will &s;olve a que&s;tion of the fir&s;t magnitude in human affairs: Whether <HI>Theory</HI> and <HI>Practice,</HI> which always agree to|gether in things of &s;lighter moment, are really to remain eternal enemies in the highe&s;t con|cerns of men?</P>
<P>The change of government in France is, properly &s;peaking, a renovation of &s;ociety;
<PB N="2" REF="024075_0005_0FC31B9D925D2C00">
an object peculiarly fitted to hurry the mind into a field of thought, which can &s;carcely be limited by the concerns of a nation, or the im|provements of an age. As there is a tendency in human nature to imitation; and, as all the apparent cau&s;es exi&s;t in mo&s;t of the govern|ments of the world, to induce the people to wi&s;h for a &s;imilar change, it becomes intere&s;t|ing to the cau&s;e of humanity, to take a deli|berate view of the real nature and extent of this change, and find what are the advantages and di&s;advantages to be expected from it.</P>
<P>There is not that necromancy in politics, which prevents our fore&s;eeing, with tolerable certainty, what is to be the re&s;ult of operati|ons &s;o univer&s;al, in which all the people con|cur. Many truths are as perceptible when fir&s;t pre&s;ented to the mind, as an age or a world of experience could make them; others require only an indirect and collateral ex|perience; &s;ome demand an experience direct and po&s;itive.</P>
<P>It is happy for human nature, that in morals we have much to do with this fir&s;t cla&s;s of truths, le&s;s with the &s;econd, and very little with the third; while in phy&s;ics we are per|petually driven to the &s;low proce&s;s of patient and po&s;itive experience.</P>
<P>The Revolution in France certainly comes recommended to us under one a&s;pect which renders it at fir&s;t view extremely inviting: it is the work of argument and rational con|viction,
<PB N="3" REF="024075_0006_0FC31B9FC72C9FC8">
and not of the &s;word. The <HI>ultima ratio regum</HI> had nothing to do with it. It was an operation de&s;igned for the benefit of the people; it originated in the people, and was conducted by the people. It had therefore a legitimate origin; and this circum&s;tance entitles it to our &s;erious contemplation, on two accounts: becau&s;e there is &s;omething ve|nerable in the idea, and becau&s;e other nations, in &s;imilar circum&s;tances, will certainly be di&s;|po&s;ed to imitate it.</P>
<P>I &s;hall therefore examine the nature and con&s;equences of a &s;imilar revolution in govern|ment, as it will affect the following principal objects, which make up the affairs of nations in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of Europe:
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. The feudal Sy&s;tem&punc;</ITEM>
<ITEM>II. The Church,</ITEM>
<ITEM>III. The Military,</ITEM>
<ITEM>IV. The Admini&s;tration of Ju&s;tice,</ITEM>
<ITEM>V. Revenue and public Expenditure,</ITEM>
<ITEM>VI. The Means of Sub&s;i&s;tence,</ITEM>
<ITEM>VII. Literature, Sciences and Arts,</ITEM>
<ITEM>VIII. War and Peace.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>The intere&s;ts of kings and hereditary &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion will not be forgotten in this arrange|ment; they will be treated with the privile|ged orders under the &s;everal heads to which their different claims belong.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be of va&s;t importance to all the cla&s;&s;es of &s;ociety, as it now &s;tands cla&s;&s;ed in Europe, to calculate before hand what they
<PB N="4" REF="024075_0007_0FC31BA823A2DD20">
are to gain or to lo&s;e by the approaching change; that, like prudent &s;tock-jobbers, they may buy in or &s;ell out, according as this great event &s;hall affect them.</P>
<P>Philo&s;ophers and contemplative men, who may think them&s;elves di&s;intere&s;ted &s;pectators of &s;o great a political drama, will do well to con&s;ider how far the cata&s;trophe is to be bene|ficial or detrimental to the human race; in or|der to determine whether in con&s;cience they ought to promote or di&s;courage, accelerate or retard it, by the publication of their opinions. It is true, the work was &s;et on foot by this fort of men; but they have not all been of the &s;ame opinion relative to the be&s;t organization of the governing power, nor how far the re|form of abu&s;es ought to extend. Monte&s;|quieu, Voltaire, and many other re&s;pectable authorities, have accreditted the principle, that republicani&s;m is not convenient for a great &s;tate. Ro&s;&s;eau and others take no no|tice of the di&s;tinction between great and &s;mall &s;tates, in deciding, that this is the only go|vernment proper to en&s;ure the happine&s;s, and &s;upport the dignity of man. Of the former opinion was a great majority of the con&s;titu|ting national a&s;&s;embly of France. Proba|bly not many years will pa&s;s, before a third opinion will be univer&s;ally adopted, never to be laid a&s;ide: That the republican principle is not only proper and &s;afe for the govern|ment of any people; but, that its propriety
<PB N="5" REF="024075_0008_0FC31BAA5286C470">
and &s;afety are in proportion to the magni|tude of the &s;ociety and the extent of the ter|ritory.</P>
<P>Among &s;incere enquirers after truth, all general que&s;tions on this &s;ubject reduce them|&s;elves to this: Whether men are to preform their duties by an ea&s;y choice or an expen|&s;ive cheat; or, whether our rea&s;on be given us to be improved or &s;tifled, to render us greater or le&s;s than brutes, to increa&s;e our happine&s;s or aggravate our mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>Among tho&s;e who&s;e anxieties ari&s;e only from intere&s;t, the enquiry is, how their privi|leges or their profe&s;&s;ions are to be affected by the new order of things. The&s;e form a cla&s;s of men re&s;pectable both for their numbers and their &s;en&s;ibility; it is our duty to attend to their ca&s;e. I &s;incerely hope to admini&s;ter &s;ome con&s;olation to them in the cour&s;e of this e&s;&s;ay. And though I have a better opinion of their philanthropy, than political opponents generally entertain of each other, yet I do not altogether rely upon their pre&s;umed &s;ympathy with their fellow-citizens, and their &s;uppo&s;ed willingne&s;s to &s;acrifice to the public good; but I hope to convince them, that the e&s;tabli&s;h|ment of general liberty will be le&s;s injurious to tho&s;e who now live by abu&s;es, than is com|monly imagined; that protected indu&s;try will produce effects far more a&s;toni&s;hing than have ever been calculated; that the increa&s;e of en|joyments will be &s;uch, as to ameliorate the condition of every human creature.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="024075_0009_0FC31BB2A5CD98D8">To per&s;uade this cla&s;s of mankind that it is neither their duty nor their intere&s;t to en|deavor to perpetuate the ancient forms of go|vernment, would be a high and holy office; it would be the greate&s;t act of charity to them, as it might teach them to avoid a danger that is otherwi&s;e unavoidable; it would preclude the occa&s;ion of the people's indulging what is &s;ometimes called a ferocious di&s;po&s;ition, which is apt to grow upon the revenge of in|juries, and render them le&s;s harmonious in their new &s;tation of citizens; it would prevent the civil wars, which might attend the in&s;ur|rections of the people, where there &s;hould be a great want of unanimity,&mdash;for we are not to expect in every country that mildne&s;s and dignity which have uniformly characterized the French, even in their mo&s;t tumultuous movements <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Whatever rea&s;on may be given for the fact, I believe all tho&s;e who have been witne&s;&s;es of what are called <HI>mobs</HI> in France (during the revolution) will join with me in opinion, that they were by no means to be compared with Engli&s;h mobs, in point of indi&s;criminate ferocity and private plunder. A popular commotion in Paris was uniformly directed to a certain well ex|plained object; from which it never was known to deviate. Whether this object were to hang a man, to arre&s;t the king, to intimidate the court, or to break the furniture of a hotel, all other per&s;ons and all other property, that fell in the way of the mob, were perfectly &s;afe.</P>
<P>The truth is, tho&s;e collections were compo&s;ed of hone&s;t and indu&s;trious people, who had nothing in view but the public good. They believed that the cau&s;e of their country required an execution of ju&s;tice more prompt than could be expected from any e&s;tabli&s;h tribunal. Be&s;ides, they were in the cri&s;is of a revolution, when they were &s;en&s;ible, that the crimes or their enemies would remain unpuni&s;hed, for want of a known rule by which they could be judged. Though a violation of <HI>right,</HI> is not always a violation of <HI>law</HI>; yet, in their opinion, occa&s;ions might exi&s;t, when it would be dangerous to let it pa&s;s with im|punity.</P>
<P>It is indeed to be hoped, that, whenever mobs in other coun|tries &s;hall be animated by the &s;ame cau&s;e, they will conduct them|&s;elves with the &s;ame dignity; and that this &s;ingular pheno|menon will be found not altogether attributable to national character.</P></NOTE>; it would remove every ob&s;ta|cle
<PB N="7" REF="024075_0010_0FC31BB776C875B8">
and every danger that may &s;eem to attend that rational &s;y&s;tem of public felicity to which the nations of Europe are moving with rapid &s;trides, and which in pro&s;pect is &s;o con&s;oling to the enlightened friends of humanity.</P>
<P>To induce the men who now govern the world to adopt the&s;e ideas, is the duty of tho&s;e who now po&s;&s;e&s;s them. I confe&s;s the ta&s;k at fir&s;t view appears more than Herculean; it will be thought an object from which the elo|quence of the clo&s;et mu&s;t &s;hrink in de&s;pair, and which prudence would leave to the more powerful argument of events. But I believe at the &s;ame time that &s;ome &s;ucce&s;s may be expec|ted; that though the haver&s;t be great, the labor|ers may not be few; that prejudice and in|tere&s;t cannot always be relied on to garri&s;on the mind again&s;t the a&s;&s;aults of truth. This belief, ill-grounded as it may appear, is &s;uffi|cient to annimate me in the cau&s;e; and to the venerable ho&s;t of republican writers, who have preceded me in the di&s;cu&s;&s;ions occa&s;ion|ed by the French revolution, this belief is my only apology for offering to join the fraterni|ty,
<PB N="8" REF="024075_0011_0FC31BB9769E6818">
and for thus practically declaring my opin|ion, that they have not exhau&s;ted the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>The very powerful weapons, the force of rea&s;on and the force of numbers, are in the hands of the political reformers. While the u&s;e of the fir&s;t brings into action the &s;econd, and en&s;ures its co-operation, it remains a &s;a|cred duty, impo&s;ed on them by the God of rea&s;on, to wield with dexterity this mild and beneficent weapon, before recurring to the u&s;e of the other; which, though legitimate, may be le&s;s harmle&s;s; though infallible in opera|tion, may be le&s;s glorious in victory.</P>
<P>The tyrannies of the world, whatever be the appellation of the government under which they are exerci&s;ed, are all ari&s;tocratical tyran|nies. An ordinance to plunder and murder, whether it fulminate from the Vatican, or &s;teal &s;ilently forth from the Harem; whether it come clothed in the <HI>certain &s;cience</HI> of a Bed of Ju&s;tice, or in the legal &s;olemnities of a bench of lawyers; whether it be purcha&s;ed by the care&s;&s;es of a woman, or the trea&s;ures of a na|tion,&mdash;never confines its effects to the benefit of a &s;ingle individual; it goes to enrich the whole combination of con&s;pirators, who&s;e bu|&s;ine&s;s it is to dupe and to govern the nation. It carries its own bribery with it&s;elf through all its progre&s;s and connexions,&mdash;in its origi|nation, in its enaction, in its vindication, in its execution; it is a fertilizing &s;tream, that waters and vivifies its happy plants in the
<PB N="9" REF="024075_0012_0FC31BBADAD12490">
numerous channels of its communication. Mini&s;ters and &s;ecretaries, commanders of ar|mies, contractors, collectors and tide-waiters, intendants, judges and lawyers,&mdash;whoever is permitted to drink of the &s;alutary &s;tream,&mdash;are all intere&s;ted in removing the ob&s;tructions and in prai&s;ing the fountain from whence it flows.</P>
<P>The &s;tate of human nature requires that this &s;hould be the ca&s;e. Among beings &s;o nearly equal in power and capacity as men of the &s;ame community are&punc; it is impo&s;&s;ible that a &s;olitary tyrant &s;hould exi&s;t. Laws that are de&s;igned to operate unequally on &s;ociety, mu&s;t offer an exclu&s;ive intere&s;t to a con&s;iderable portion of its members, to en&s;ure their execu|tion upon the re&s;t. Hence has ari&s;en the nece&s;&s;ity of that &s;trange complication in the governing power, which has made of politics an inexplicable &s;cience; hence the rea&s;on for arming one cla&s;s of our fellow creatures with the weapons of bodily de&s;truction, and another with the my&s;terious artillery of the vengeance of heaven; hence the cau&s;e of what in Eng|land is called the independence of the judges, and what on the continent has created a judi|ciary nobility, a &s;et of men who purcha&s;e the privilege of being the profe&s;&s;ional enemies of the people, of &s;elling their deci&s;ions to the rich, and of di&s;tributing individual oppre&s;&s;ion; hence the &s;ource of tho&s;e Draconian codes of criminal juri&s;prudence which en&s;hrine the idol property in a bloody &s;anctuary, and teach
<PB N="10" REF="024075_0013_0FC31BBD11B88790">
the modern European, that his life is of le&s;s value than the &s;hoes on his feet; hence the po&s;itive di&s;couragements laid upon agriculture manufactures, commerce, and every method of improving the condition of men; for it is to be ob&s;erved, that in every country the &s;hackles impo&s;ed upon indu&s;try are in propor|tion to the degree of general de&s;poti&s;m that reigns in the government. This ari&s;es not only from the greater debility and want of enterpri&s;e in the people, but from the &s;uperior nece&s;&s;ity that &s;uch governments are under, to prevent their &s;ubjects from acquiring that ea&s;e and information, by which they could di&s;|cern the evil and apply the remedy.</P>
<P>To the &s;ame fruitful &s;ource of calamities we are to trace that perver&s;ity of rea&s;on, which, in governments where men are permitted to di&s;|cu&s;s political &s;ubjects, has given ri&s;e to tho&s;e perpetual &s;hifts of &s;ophi&s;try by which they vindicate the prerogative of kings. In one age it is the <HI>right of conque&s;t,</HI> in another <HI>the divine right,</HI> then it comes to be a <HI>compact between king and people,</HI> and la&s;t of all, it is &s;aid to be founded on general convenience, <HI>the good of the whole community.</HI> In England the&s;e &s;everal arguments have all had their day; though it is a&s;toni&s;hing that the two former could ever have been the &s;ubjects of rational debate: the fir&s;t is the logic of the mu&s;quet, and the &s;econd of the chalice; the one was buried at Rennimede on the &s;ignature of Mag|na
<PB N="11" REF="024075_0014_0FC31BC203B72FE8">
Charta, the other took its flight to the con+tinent with James the Second. The com|pact of king and people has lain dormant the greater part of the pre&s;ent century; till it was rou&s;ed from &s;lumber by the French revolu|tion, and came into the &s;ervice of Mr. Burke.</P>
<P>Ha&s;ty men di&s;cover their errors when it is too late. It had certainly been much more con&s;i&s;tent with the temperament of that wri|ter's mind, and quite as &s;erviceable to his cau&s;e, to have recalled the fugitive claim of the divine right of kings. It would have given a my&s;tic force to his declamation, afford|ed him many new epithets, and furni&s;hed &s;ub|jects perfectly accordant with the copious charges of <HI>&s;acrilege, athei&s;m, murders, a&s;&s;a&s;|&s;inations, rapes</HI> and <HI>plunders</HI> with which his three volumes abound. He then could not have di&s;appointed his friends by his total want of argument, as he now does in his two fir&s;t e&s;&s;ays; for on &s;uch a &s;ubject no argument could be expected; and in his third, where it is patiently attempted, he would have avoid|ed the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;howing that he has none, by giving a different title to his book; for the "appeal," in&s;tead of being "from the new to the old whigs," would have been <HI>from the new whigs to the old tories</HI>; and he might as well have appealed to Cae&s;ar; he could have found at this day no court to take cognizance of his cau&s;e.</P>
<P>But the great advantage of this mode of
<PB N="12" REF="024075_0015_0FC31BC3ECC97440">
handling the &s;ubject would have been, that it could have provoked no an&s;wers; the gauntlet might have been thrown, without a cham|pion to have taken it up; and the la&s;t &s;olitary admirer of chivalry have retired in negative triumph from the field.</P>
<P>Mr. Burke, however, in his de&s;ence of royalty, does not rely on this argument of the compact. Whether it be, that he is con|&s;cious of its futility, or that in his rage he forgets that he has u&s;ed it, he is perpetually recurring to the la&s;t ground that has yet been heard of, on which we are called upon to con|&s;ider kings even as a tolerable nui&s;ance, and to &s;upport the exi&s;ting forms of govern|ment: this ground is <HI>the general good of the community.</HI> It is &s;aid to be dangerous to pull down &s;y&s;tems that are already formed, or even to attempt to improve them; and it is like|wi&s;e &s;aid, that, were they peaceably de&s;troy|ed, and we had &s;ociety to build up anew, it would be be&s;t to create hereditary kings, hereditary orders, and exclu&s;ive privileges.</P>
<P>The&s;e are &s;ober opinions, uniting a cla&s;s of rea&s;oners too numerous and too re&s;pectable to be treated with contempt. I believe how|ever that their number is every day dimi|ni&s;hing, and I believe the example which France will &s;oon be obliged to exhibit to the world on this &s;ubject, will induce every man to reject them, who is not per&s;onally and ex|clu&s;ively intere&s;ted in their &s;upport.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="024075_0016_0FC31BC55EFEB140">The incon&s;i&s;tency of the con&s;tituting a&s;|&s;embly, in retaining an hereditary king, armed with an enormous civil li&s;t, to wage war with a popular government, has induced &s;ome per&s;ons to predict the downfall of their con&s;titution. But this mea&s;ure had a dif|ferent origin from what is commonly a&s;|&s;igned to it, and will probably have a different i&s;&s;ue. It was the re&s;ult rather of local and temporary circum&s;tances, than of any general belief in the utility of kings, under any mo|difications or limitations that could be at|tached to the office.</P>
<P>It is to be ob&s;erved, <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> that the French had a king upon their hands. This king had always been con&s;idered as a well-di&s;po&s;ed man; &s;o that, by a fatality &s;omewhat &s;ingular, though not unexampled in <HI>regal hi&s;tory,</HI> he gained the love of the people, almo&s;t in pro|portion to the mi&s;chief which he did them. <HI>Secondly,</HI> their king had very powerful family connexions, in the &s;overeigns of Spain, Au|&s;tria, Naples and Sardinia; be&s;ides his rela|tions within the kingdom, whom it was ne|ce&s;&s;ary to attach, if po&s;&s;ible, to the intere&s;ts of the community. <HI>Thirdly,</HI> the revolution was con&s;idered by all Europe as a high and dangerous experiment. It was nece&s;&s;ary to hide as much as po&s;&s;ible the appearance of its magnitude from the eye of the di&s;tant ob&s;erver. The reformers con&s;idered it as their duty to produce an internal regeneration of &s;ociety,
<PB N="14" REF="024075_0017_0FC31BCF992FF3C8">
rather than an external change in the appear|ance of the court; to &s;et in order the count|ing-hou&s;e and the kitchen, before arranging the drawing-room. This would leave the &s;overeigns of Europe totally without a pretext for interfering; while it would be con&s;oling to that cla&s;s of philo&s;ophers, who &s;till believed in the compatibility of royalty and liberty. <HI>Fourthly,</HI> this decree, That <HI>France &s;hould have a king,</HI> and that he <HI>could do no wrong,</HI> was pa&s;&s;ed at an early period of their operations; when the above rea&s;ons were apparently more urgent than they were afterwards, or probably will ever be again.</P>
<P>From the&s;e con&s;iderations we may con|clude, that royalty is pre&s;erved in France for rea&s;ons which are fugitive; that a majority of the con&s;tituting a&s;&s;embly did not believe in it, as an ab&s;tract principle; that a majority of the people will learn to be di&s;gu&s;ted with &s;o unnatural and ponderous a deformity in their new edifice, and will &s;oon hew it off.</P>
<P>After this improvement &s;hall have been made, a few years experience in the face of Europe, and on &s;o great a theatre as that of France, will probably leave but one opinion in the minds of hone&s;t men relative to the re|publican principle, or the great &s;implicity of nature applied to the organization of &s;ociety.</P>
<P>The example of America would have had great weight in producing this conviction; but it is too little known to the European rea|&s;oner,

to be a &s;ubject of accurate inve&s;tigati|on. Be&s;ides, the difference of circum&s;tances between that country and the &s;tates of Europe has given occa&s;ion for imagining many di|&s;tinctions which exi&s;t not in fact, and has pre|vented the application of principles which are permanently founded in nature, and follow not the trifling variations in the &s;tate of &s;ociety.</P>
<P>But I have not pre&s;cribed to my&s;elf the ta&s;k of entering into arguments on the utility of kings, or of inve&s;tigating the meaning of Mr. Burke in order to compliment him with an additional refutation.

It de|pends on a much more important cla&s;s of men, the cla&s;s that cannot write; and in a great mea&s;ure, on tho&s;e who cannot read.

<HEAD>CHAP. I. Feudal Sy&s;tem.</HEAD>
<P>THE mo&s;t prominent feature in the moral face of Europe, was imprinted upon it by conque&s;t. It is the re&s;ult of the &s;ubordination nece&s;&s;ary among military &s;avages, on their be|coming cultivators of the &s;oil which they had de&s;olated, and making an advantageous u&s;e of &s;uch of the inhabitants as they did not choo&s;e to ma&s;&s;acre, and could not &s;ell to fo|reigners for &s;laves.</P>
<P>The relation thus e&s;tabli&s;hed between the officers and the &s;oldiers, between the victors and the vanqui&s;hed, and between them all and the lands which they were to cultivate, mo|dified by the experience of unlettered ages, has obtained the name of the Feudal Sy&s;tem, and may be con&s;idered as the foundation of all the political in&s;titutions in this quarter of the world. The claims re&s;ulting to particu|lar cla&s;&s;es of men, under this modification of &s;ociety, are called Feudal Rights; and to the individual po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors they are either nomi|nal or real, conveying an empty title or a &s;ub&s;tantial profit.</P>
<P>My intention is not to enter on the details of this &s;y&s;tem, as a lawyer, or to trace its pro|gre&s;s
<PB N="17" REF="024075_0020_0FC31BDA502D9230">
with the accuracy of an hi&s;torian, and &s;how its peculiar fitne&s;s to the rude ages of &s;ociety which gave it birth. But, viewing it as an ancient edifice, who&s;e foundation, worn away by the current of events, can no longer &s;upport its weight, I would &s;ketch a few draw|ings, to &s;how the &s;tyle of its architecture, and compare it with the model of the new build|ing to be erected in its place.</P>
<P>The <HI>philo&s;ophy</HI> of the Feudal Sy&s;tem, is all that remains of it worthy of our contemplati|on. This I will attempt to trace in &s;ome of its leading points, leaving the practical part to fall, with its ancient founders and its modern admirers, into the peaceful gulph of oblivion; to which I wi&s;h it a &s;peedy and an unob&s;truct|ed pa&s;&s;age.</P>
<P>The original object of this in&s;titution was undoubtedly, what it was alledged to be, the pre&s;ervation of turbulent &s;ocieties, in which men are held together but by feeble ties; and it effected its purpo&s;e by uniting the per&s;onal intere&s;t of the head of each family, with the perpetual &s;afety of the &s;tate. Thus far the purpo&s;e was laudable, and the means extreme|ly well calculated for the end. But it was the fortune of this &s;y&s;tem to attach it&s;elf to tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ions of human nature which vary not with the change of circum&s;tances. While national motives cea&s;ed by degrees to require its continuance, family motives forbade to lay it a&s;ide. The &s;ame progre&s;&s;ive improve|ments
<PB N="18" REF="024075_0021_0FC31BDE12B0ED68">
in &s;ociety, which rendered military te|nures and military titles fir&s;t unnece&s;&s;ary and then injurious to the general intere&s;t, at the &s;ame time &s;harpened the avarice, and piqued the honor of tho&s;e who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them, to pre&s;erve the exclu&s;ive privileges which ren|dered them thus di&s;tingui&s;hed. And the&s;e privileges, united with the operations of the church, have founded and &s;upported the de&s;poti&s;ms of Europe in all their divi&s;ions, combinations and refinements.</P>
<P>Feudal Rights are either <HI>territorial</HI> or <HI>per|&s;onal.</HI> I &s;hall divide them into the&s;e two cla&s;&s;es, for the &s;ake of be&s;towing a few ob&s;er|vations upon each.</P>
<P>The pernicious effects of the &s;y&s;tem on ter|ritorial tenures are inconceivably various and great. In a legal view, it has led to tho&s;e intricacies and vexations, which we find at|tached to every circum&s;tance of real property which have perplexed the &s;cience of civil ju|ri&s;prudence, which have perpetuated the ig|norance of the people, relative to the admini|&s;tration of ju&s;tice, rendered nece&s;&s;ary the intervention of lawyers, and multiplied the means of oppre&s;&s;ion. But, in a political view, its con&s;equences are &s;till more &s;erious, and demand a particular con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t quality of the feudal tenure is to confine the de&s;cendible property to the <HI>elde&s;t male i&s;&s;ue.</HI> To &s;ay that this is contrary to nature, is but a feeble expre&s;&s;ion. So abo|minable
<PB N="19" REF="024075_0022_0FC31BE7D48E38E8">
is its operation, that it has &s;educed and perverted nature; her voice is &s;tifled: intere&s;t it&s;elf is laid a&s;leep, and nothing but the eloquence of an incomprehen&s;ible pride is heard on the occa&s;ion. You will hear fa|ther and mother, younger brothers and &s;i&s;|ters, rejoice in this provi&s;ion of the law; the former con&s;igning their daughters to the gloo|my pri&s;on of a convent, and their younger &s;ons to the church or the army, to en&s;ure their celibacy; that no remnant of the family may remain but the heir of the e&s;tate entire; the latter congratulating each other, that the elder brother will tran&s;mit unimpaired the ti|tle and the property, while they them&s;elves are content to peri&s;h in the ob&s;curity of their &s;everal de&s;tinations. It is probable that, in another age, a tale of this kind will &s;carcely gain credit, and that the tear of &s;en&s;ibility may be &s;pared by a di&s;belief of the fact. It is however no creature of the imagination; it happened every day in France previous to the revolution; I have &s;een it with my own eyes and heard it with my own ears; it is now to be &s;een and heard in mo&s;t other ca|tholic countries.</P>
<P>But other points of view &s;how this di&s;po&s;i|tion of the law to be &s;till more reprehen&s;ible in the eye of political philo&s;ophy. It &s;wells the inequality of wealth, which, even in the be&s;t regulated &s;ociety, is but too con&s;idera|ble; it habituates the people to believe in an
<PB N="20" REF="024075_0023_0FC31BEC06527C08">
unnatural inequality in the rights of men, and by this means prepares them for &s;ervility and oppre&s;&s;ion; it prevents the improvement of lands, and impedes the progre&s;s of indu&s;try and cultivation, which are be&s;t promoted on &s;mall e&s;tates, where proprietors cultivate for them|&s;elves; it di&s;courages population, by inducing to a life of celibacy.&mdash;But I &s;hall &s;peak of celibacy when I &s;peak of the church.</P>
<P>Whether men are born to govern, or to o|bey, or to enjoy equal liberty, depends not on the original capacity of the mind, but on the <HI>in&s;tinct of analogy,</HI> or the <HI>habit of think|ing.</HI> When children of the &s;ame family are taught to believe in the unconquerable di&s;|tinctions of birth among them&s;elves, they are completely fitted for a feudal government; becau&s;e their minds are familiari&s;ed with all the gradations and degradations that &s;uch a government requires. The birth-right of domincering is not more readily claimed on the one hand, than it is acknowledged on the other; and the Jamaica planter is not more habitually convinced that an European is &s;u|perior to an African, than he is that a lord is better than him&s;elf.</P>
<P>This &s;ubject de&s;erves to be placed in a light, in which no writer as far as I know, has yet con&s;idered it. When a per&s;on was repeating to Fontenelle the common adage <HI>l'habitude e&s;t la &s;econde nature,</HI> the philo&s;opher replied, <HI>Et &s;aites moi la grace de me dire, quelle e&s;t la
<PB N="21" REF="024075_0024_0FC31BF2F520E038">
premiere.</HI> When we a&s;&s;ert that nature has e&s;tabli&s;hed <HI>inequalities</HI> among men, and has thus given to &s;ome the right of governing o|thers, or when we maintain the <HI>contrary</HI> of this po&s;ition, we &s;hould be careful to define what &s;ort of nature we mean, whether the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> or <HI>&s;econd nature</HI>; or whether we mean that there is but one. A mere &s;avage, Colocolo <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the Araucana of Ercilla.</NOTE> for in&s;tance, would decide the que&s;tion of equality by a trial of bodily &s;trength, de&s;ig|nating the man that could lift the heavie&s;t beam to be the legi&s;lator; and unle&s;s all men could lift the &s;ame beam, they could not be equal in their rights. Ari&s;totle would give the preference to him that excelled in mental capacity. Uly&s;&s;es would make the deci&s;ion upon a compound ratio of both. But there appears to me another &s;tep in this ladder, and that the <HI>habit of thinking</HI> is the only &s;afe and univer&s;al criterion to which, in practice, the que&s;tion can be referred. Indeed, when in|tere&s;t is laid a&s;ide, it is the only one to which, in civilized ages, it ever is referred. We never &s;ubmit to a king, becau&s;e he is &s;trong|er than we in bodily force, nor becau&s;e he is &s;uperior in under&s;tandig or in information; but becau&s;e we believe him born to govern, or at lea&s;t, becau&s;e a majority of the &s;ociety believes it.</P>
<P>The <HI>habit of thinking</HI> has &s;o much of nature in it, it is &s;o undi&s;tingui&s;hable from the inde|lible
<PB N="22" REF="024075_0025_0FC31BF400D9AE90">
marks of the man, that it is a perfectly &s;afe foundation for any &s;y&s;tem that we may choo&s;e to build upon it; indeed it is the <HI>only</HI> foundation, for it is the only point of contact by which men communicate as moral a&s;&s;oci|ates. As a practical po&s;ition therefore, and as relating to almo&s;t all places and almo&s;t all times, in which the experiment has yet been made. Ari&s;totle was as right in teaching, <HI>That &s;ome are born to command, and others to be commanded,</HI> as the national a&s;&s;embly was in declaring, That <HI>men are born and al|ways continue free and equal in re&s;pect to their rights.</HI> The latter is as apparently fal&s;e in the diet of Rati&s;bon, as the former is in the hall of the Jacobins.</P>
<P>Ab&s;tractedly con&s;idered, there can be no doubt of the unchangeable truth of the a&s;&s;em|bly's declaration; and they have taken the right method to make it a <HI>practical</HI> truth, by publi&s;hing it to the world for di&s;cu&s;&s;ion. A general belief <HI>that it is a truth,</HI> makes it at once practical, confirms it in one nation, and extends it to others.</P>
<P>A due attention to the a&s;toni&s;hing effects that are wrought in the world by <HI>the habit of thinking,</HI> will &s;erve many valuable purpo&s;es. I cannot therefore di&s;mi&s;s the &s;ubject &s;o &s;oon as I intended; but will mention one or two in&s;tances of the&s;e effects, and leave the re|flection of the reader to make the applicati|on to a thou&s;and others.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="024075_0026_0FC31BFB15192F20"><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> It is evident that all the arbitrary &s;y&s;tems in the world are founded and &s;up|ported on this <HI>&s;econd nature</HI> of man, in coun|teraction of the <HI>fir&s;t.</HI> Sy&s;tems which di&s;tort and cru&s;h and &s;ubjugate every thing that we can &s;uppo&s;e original and characteri&s;tic in man, as an undi&s;torted being. It &s;u&s;tains the mo&s;t ab&s;urd and abominable theories of religion, and honors them with as many martyrs as it does tho&s;e that are the mo&s;t peaceful and beneficent.</P>
<P>But <HI>&s;econdly,</HI> we find for our con&s;olation, that it will likewi&s;e &s;upport &s;y&s;tems of equal liberty and national happine&s;s. In the Unit|ed States of America, the &s;cience of liberty is univer&s;ally under&s;tood, felt and practi&s;ed, as much by the &s;imple as the wi&s;e, the weak as the &s;trong. Their deep-rooted and invete|rate habit of thinking is, that <HI>all men are e|qual in their rights,</HI> that <HI>it is impo&s;&s;ible to make them otherwi&s;e;</HI> and this being their undi&s;|turbed belief, they have no conception how any man in his &s;en&s;es can entertain any other. This point once &s;ettled, every thing is &s;et|tled. Many operations, which in Europe have been con&s;idered as incredible tales or dangerous experiments, are but the infalible con&s;equences of this great principle. The fir&s;t of the&s;e operations is <HI>the bu&s;ine&s;s of elec|tion,</HI> which with that people is carried on with as much gravity as their daily labor. There is no jealou&s;y on the occa&s;ion, nothing lucra|tive
<PB N="24" REF="024075_0027_0FC31BFC290407D0">
in office; any man in &s;ocieiy may attain to any place in the government, and may ex|erci&s;e its functions. They believe that there is nothing more difficult in the management of the affairs of a nation, than the affairs of a family; that it only requires more hands. They believe that it is the juggle of keeping up impo&s;itions to blind the eyes of the vulgar, that con&s;titutes the intricacy of &s;tate. Ba|ni&s;h the my&s;tici&s;m of inequality, and you ba|ni&s;h almo&s;t all the evils attendant on human nature.</P>
<P>The people being habituated to the electi|on of all kinds of officers, the <HI>magnitude</HI> of the office makes no difficulty in the ca&s;e. The Pre&s;ident of the United States, who has more power while in office than &s;ome of the kings of Europe, is cho&s;en with as little com|motion as a churchwarden. There is a pub|lic &s;ervice to be performed, and the people &s;ay who &s;hall do it. The &s;ervant feels honor|ed with the confidence repo&s;ed in him, and generally expre&s;&s;es his gratitude by a faith|ful performance.</P>
<P>Another of the&s;e operations is making e|very citizen a &s;oldier, and every &s;oldier a citizen; not only <HI>permitting</HI> every man to arm, but <HI>obliging</HI> him to arm. This fact told in Europe previous to the French revolution, woule have gained little credit; or at lea&s;t it would have been regarded as a mark of an uncivilized people, extremely dangerous to
<PB N="25" REF="024075_0028_0FC31BFE12ABA9C0">
a well ordered &s;ociety. Men who build &s;y&s;|tems on an inver&s;ion of nature, are obliged to invert every thing that is to make part of that &s;y&s;tem. It is <HI>becau&s;e the people are civi|lized, that they are with &s;afety armed.</HI> It is an effect of their con&s;cious dignity, as citi|zens enjoying equal rights, that they wi&s;h not to invade the rights of others. The danger (where there is any) from armed ci|tizens, is only to the <HI>government,</HI> not to the <HI>&s;ociety</HI>; and as long as they have nothing to revenge in the government (which they can|not have while it is in their own hands) there are many advantages in their being accu&s;tom|ed to the u&s;e of arms, and no po&s;&s;ible di&s;ad|vantage.</P>
<P><HI>Power,</HI> habitually in the hands of a whole community, lo&s;es all the ordinary a&s;&s;ociated ideas of power. The exerci&s;e of power is a relative term; it &s;uppo&s;es an oppo&s;ition,&mdash; &s;omething to operate upon. We perceive no exertion of power in the motion of the planetary &s;y&s;tem, but a very &s;trong one in the movement of a whirlwind; it is becau&s;e we &s;ee ob&s;tructions to the latter, but none to the former. Where the government is <HI>not</HI> in the hands of the people, there you find op|po&s;ition, you perceive two contending inte|re&s;ts, and get an idea of the exerci&s;e of pow|er; and whether this power be in the hands of the government or of the people, or whether it change from &s;ide to &s;ide, it is always to be
<PB N="26" REF="024075_0029_0FC31C0150B62320">
dreaded. But the word <HI>people</HI> in America, has a different meaning from what it has in Europe. It there means the whole com|munity, and comprehends every human crea|ture; here it means &s;omething el&s;e more dif|ficult to define.</P>
<P>Another con&s;equence of the habitual idea of equality, is the <HI>facility of changing the &s;tructure of their government</HI> whenever and as often as the &s;ociety &s;hall think there is any thing in it to amend. As Mr. Burke has written no "reflections on the revolution" in America, the people there have never yet been told that they had no <HI>right</HI> "to frame a government for them&s;elves;" they have therefore done much of this bu&s;ine&s;s, without ever affixing to it the idea of "&s;acrilege" or "u&s;urpation," or any other term of rant to be found in that gentleman's vocabulary.</P>
<P>Within a few years the fifteen &s;tates have not only framed each its own &s;tate-con&s;titu|tion, and two &s;ucce&s;&s;ive Federal con&s;titutions; but &s;ince the &s;ettlement of the pre&s;ent gene|ral government in the year 1789, three of the &s;tates, Penn&s;ylvania, South-Carolina and Georgia, have totally new modeled their own. And all this is done without the lea&s;t confu|&s;ion; the operation being &s;carcely known beyond the limits of the &s;tate where it is per|formed. Thus they are in the habit of "<HI>choo&s;|ing their own governors,</HI>" of "<HI>ca&s;hiering them for mi&s;conduct,</HI>" of "<HI>framing a govern|ment
<PB N="27" REF="024075_0030_0FC31C03BB059A98">
for them&s;elves,</HI>" and all tho&s;e abomina|ble things, the mere naming of which, in Mr. Burke's opinion, has polluted the pul|pit in the Old Jury.</P>
<P>But it is &s;aid, The&s;e things will do very well for America, where the people are le&s;s numerous, le&s;s indigent, and better in&s;truct|ed; but they will not apply to Europe. This objection de&s;erves a reply, not becau&s;e it is &s;olid, but becau&s;e it is fa&s;hionable. It may be an&s;wered, that &s;ome parts of Spain, much of Poland, and almo&s;t the whole of Ru&s;&s;ia, are le&s;s peopled than the &s;ettled country in the United States; that poverty and igno|rance are <HI>effects</HI> of &s;lavery rather than its <HI>cau&s;es</HI>; but the be&s;t an&s;wer to be given, is the example of France. To the event of that re|volution I will tru&s;t the argument. Let the people have time to become thoroughly and &s;oberly grounded in the doctrine of <HI>equality,</HI> and there is no danger of oppre&s;&s;ion either from government or from anarchy. Very little in&s;truction is nece&s;&s;ary to teach a man his rights; and there is no per&s;on of com|mon intellects in the mo&s;t ignorant corner of Europe, but receives le&s;&s;ons enough, if they were of the proper kind. For writing and reading are not indi&s;pen&s;ible to the object; it is <HI>thinking</HI> right which makes them act right. Every child is taught to repeat about fifty Latin prayers, which &s;et up the Pope, the Bi&s;hop, and the King, as the trinity of
<PB N="28" REF="024075_0031_0FC31C0B007510C0">
his adoration; he is taught that <HI>the powers that be are ordained of God,</HI> and therefore the &s;oldier quartered in the pari&s;h has a right to cut his throat. Half this in&s;truction, upon oppo&s;ite principles, would go a great way; in that ca&s;e nature would be a&s;&s;i&s;ted, while here &s;he is counteracted. Engrave it on the heart of a man, <HI>that all men are equal in rights,</HI> and that the <HI>government is their own,</HI> and then per&s;uade him to &s;ell his crucifix and buy a mu&s;quet,&mdash;and you have made him a good citizen.</P>
<P>Another con&s;equence of a &s;ettled belief in the equality of rights, is, that under this belief <HI>there is no danger from Anarchy.</HI> This word has likewi&s;e acquired a different mean|ing in America from what we read of it in books. In Europe it means confu&s;ion, at|tended with mobs and carnage, where the in|nocent peri&s;h with the guilty. But it is very different where a country is <HI>u&s;ed</HI> to a repre|&s;entative government, though it &s;hould have an interval of no government at all. Where the people at large feel and know that they <HI>can do every thing</HI> by them&s;elves per&s;onally, they really do nothing by them&s;elves per&s;onally. In the heat of the American revolution, when the people in &s;ome &s;tates were for a long time without the lea&s;t &s;hadow of law or govern|ment, they always acted by committees and repre&s;entation. This they mu&s;t call anarchy for they know no other.</P>
<P>The&s;e are materials for the formation of
<PB N="29" REF="024075_0032_0FC31C0BF67066C0">
governments, which need not be dread|ed, though disjointed and laid a&s;under to make &s;ome repairs. They are deep-root|ed habits of thinking, which almo&s;t change the moral nature of man; they are prin|ciples as much unknown to the ancient re|publics as to the modern monarchies of Europe.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t not therefore rely upon &s;y&s;tems drawn from the experimental rea&s;onings of Ari&s;totle, when we find them contradicted by what we feel to be the eternal truth of na|ture, and &s;ee brought to the te&s;t of our own experience. Ari&s;totle was certainly a great politician; and Claudius Ptolemy was a great geographer; but the latter has &s;aid not a word of America, the large&s;t quarter of the globe; nor the former of repre&s;entative re|publics, the re&s;ource of afflicted humanity.</P>
<P>Since I have brought the&s;e two great lumi|naries of &s;cience &s;o near together, I will keep them in company a moment longer, to &s;how the &s;trange partiality that we may retain for one &s;uper&s;tition after having laid a&s;ide another, though they are built on &s;imilar foundations. Ptolemy wrote a &s;y&s;tem of a&s;tronomy; in which he taught, among other things, that the earth was the centre of the univer&s;e, and that the heavenly bodies moved round it. This &s;y&s;tem is now taught (to the exclu&s;ion by a|nathama of all others) in Turkey, Arabia, Per&s;ia, Pale&s;tine, Egypt, and wherever the
<PB N="30" REF="024075_0033_0FC31C0DD6069C60">
doctrines of Mahomet are taught; while at the &s;ame time, and with the &s;ame reverence, the politics of Ari&s;totle are taught at the univer|&s;ity of Oxford. The ground which &s;upports the one is, that the &s;un &s;topt its cour&s;e at the command of Jo&s;hua, which it could not have done, had it not been in motion; and the other, that <HI>the powers that be are ordained of God.</HI> Mention to a Mu&s;&s;ulman the Co|pernican &s;y&s;tem, and you might as well &s;peak to Mr. Burke about the rights of man; they both call you an athei&s;t.&mdash;But I will proceed with the feudal &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>The next quality of a feudal tenure is what is commonly called on the continent the right of <HI>&s;ub&s;titution,</HI> in the Engli&s;h law, known by the name of <HI>entail.</HI> Of all the methods that have yet been di&s;covered to prevent men from enjoying the advantages that nature has laid before them, this is the mo&s;t extraordinary, and in many re&s;pects the mo&s;t effectual. There have been &s;uper&s;titions entertained by many nations relative to property in lands; rendering them more difficult of alienation than other po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and con&s;equently, le&s;s productive.

He quots with &s;ingular plea&s;ure the words of Sir William Herle, who informs us that
<Q>King Edward I. was the wi&s;e&s;t king that e|ver was, and they were &s;age men that made this &s;tatute.</Q>
Whatever wi&s;dom there is in the &s;tatute, is of an elder growth. It is a plant of genuine feudal extraction brought in|to England by the Normans or Saxons, or &s;ome other conquerors; and though &s;ettled as common law, it began to be di&s;regarded and di&s;pi&s;ed by the judicial tribunals, as a &s;en&s;e of good policy prevailed. But the progre&s;s of liberality was arre&s;ted by that parliament, and the law of entailments pa&s;&s;ed into the &s;tatute of We&s;tmin&s;ter the &s;econd.</P>
<P>This was con&s;idered as law in America, previous to the revolution. But that epoch of light and liberty has freed one quarter of the world from this mi&s;erable appendage of Gothici&s;m; and France has now begun to break the &s;hackles from another quarter, where they were more &s;trongly riveted. The &s;imple de&s;truction of the&s;e two laws, of <HI>entailment</HI> and <HI>primogeniture,</HI> if you add to it the <HI>freedom of the pre&s;s,</HI> will en&s;ure the continuance of liberty in any country where it is once e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>
<P>Other territorial rights, peculiar to the feu|dal tenure, are le&s;s general in their operation, though almo&s;t infinite in their number and variety. Not a current of water, nor a mill-&s;eat, nor a fi&s;h-pond, nor a fore&s;t, nor

The national a&s;&s;embly in one decree &s;up|pre&s;&s;ed about one hundred and fifty of the&s;e taxes by name, be&s;ides a general &s;weeping clau&s;e in the act, which perhaps de&s;troyed as many more, the names of which no man could report.</P>
<P>One general character will apply to all the&s;e impo&s;itions: they are a di&s;couragement to agriculture, an embara&s;&s;ment to commerce &mdash;they humiliate one part of the community, &s;well the pride of the other, and are a real pecuniary di&s;advantage to both.</P>

On the fir&s;t inve&s;titure of a fief, the &s;uperior lord (&s;uppo&s;ing he had any right to it him&s;elf) has doubtle&s;s the power of granting it on what|ever terms the va&s;&s;al will agree to. It is an even bargain between the parties; and an

<P>A nobleman of Tu&s;cany, at this moment, canot &s;tep his foot over the limits of the du|chy without leave from the Grand Duke, on pain of forfeiting his e&s;tate. Similar laws prevail in all feudal countries, where revolu|tions have not yet prevailed. They &s;lee be|fore the &s;earching eye of liberty, and will &s;oon flee from Europe.</P>
<P>Hitherto we have treated of claims, whe|ther per&s;onal or territorial, that are confined to the elde&s;t &s;ons of families; but there is one genuine feudal claim, which "&s;preads undivided" to all the children, runs in all collateral directions, and extends to every drop of noble blood, wherever found, how|ever mixed or adultrated&mdash;it is the claim of <HI>idlene&s;s.</HI> In general it is &s;uppo&s;ed that all indigent noble children are to be provided for by the government. But alas! the &s;warm is too great to be ea&s;ily hived. Though the army, the navy, and the church, with all their po&s;&s;ible multiplication of places, are occupied only by them, yet, as celibacy de|prives them not of the means of propagation, the number continues &s;o con&s;iderable, that many remain out of employment and de&s;ti|tute of the means of &s;upport.</P>

Were it not for the danger of being milled by the want of information, we &s;hould readily determine, that under the a&s;&s;umption of chri&s;tianity it has committed greater rava|ges than under any other of its dreadful de|nominations.</P>

But it is perhaps in mercy to mankind, that we are not able to calculate, with any accuracy, even this portion of human calamities. When Con&s;tantine ordered that the <HI>hierarchy</HI> &s;hould a&s;&s;ume the name of Chri&s;t, we are not to con|&s;ider him as forming a new weapon of de|&s;truction; he only changed a name, which had grown into di&s;repute, and would &s;erve the purpo&s;e no longer, for one that was gain|ing an exten&s;ive reputation; it being built on a faith that was likely to meet the a&s;&s;ent of a con&s;iderable portion of mankind. The cold-hearted <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The report of Zo&s;imus re&s;pecting the motives which induced Con&s;tantine to embrace Chri&s;tianity, has not been generally cre|dited, though the circum&s;tance is probable in it&s;elf, and the au|thor is con&s;idered in other re&s;pects an hi&s;torian of undoubted ve|racity; having written the hi&s;tory of all the emperors, down to his own time, which was the beginning of the fifth century.</P>

The Chri&s;tian doctors &s;eized this occa&s;ion to admini&s;ter to the wants of the emperor, on condition that he would admini&s;ter to theirs; the bargain was advantageous on both &s;ides; he declared him&s;elf a Chri&s;tian, and took the church under his protection, and they pronounce his pardon.</P>
<P>The fawning &s;ervility of the new church and the blunt &s;everity of the old, on that occa&s;ion, mark the preci&s;e character of the ec|cle&s;ia&s;tical policy of all ages; and both examples have been fol|lowed in numerous in&s;tances. The manoevres of the Pope on the conver&s;ion of Clovis, on &s;anctioning the u&s;urpation of Pepin, and on the coronation of Charlemagne, are among the imitations of the former; the ridiculous cha&s;ti&s;ement of Henry the Second of England, and the numerous anathemas fulminated again&s;t whole kingdoms, are proofs of the latter, We may likewi&s;e remark, that the conduct of Con&s;tantine has been copied in all its e&s;&s;ential points by Henry the Eighth.</P></NOTE> cruelty of that monarch's

<P>In this enumeration, we have taken no no|tice of that train of calamities which attended the reconver&s;ion of the ea&s;tern empire, and attaching it to the faith of Mahomet; nor of the various havoc which followed the di&s;|memberment of the catholic church by that fortunate &s;chi&s;m, which by &s;ome is denomi|nated the Lutheran here&s;y, and by others the Prote&s;tant reformation.</P>
<P>But the&s;e, it will be &s;aid, are only general traits of uncivilized-character, which we all contemplate with horror, and which, among enlightened nations, there can be no danger of being renewed.

from any &s;tate-e&s;tabli&s;hment of religion. For proofs of the former, we need not penetrate into Spain or Italy, nor recal the hi&s;tory of the late fanatical management of the war in Brabant, but look to the two mo&s;t enlightened countries in Europe; &s;ee the riots at Bir|mingham, and the conduct of the refractory prie&s;ts in France.</P>
<P>With regard to the &s;econd remark,&mdash;we may as well own the truth at fir&s;t as at la&s;t, and have &s;en&s;e this year as the next: <HI>The exi&s;t|ence of any kind of liberty is incompatible with the exi&s;tence of any kind of church.</HI> By <HI>liber|ty</HI> I mean the enjoyment of equal rights, and by <HI>church</HI> I mean any mode of wor&s;hip de|clared to be national, or declared to have any preference in the eye of the law.</P>
<P>To render this truth a little more familiar to the mind of any reader who &s;hall find him|&s;elf &s;tartled with it, we will take a view of the church in a different light from what we have yet con&s;idered it. We have noticed hitherto only its mo&s;t &s;triking characteri&s;tics, in which it appears like a giant, &s;talking over &s;ociety, and wielding the &s;word of &s;laughter; but it likewi&s;e performs the office of &s;ilent di&s;ea&s;e and of unperceived decay; where we may contemplate it as a canker, corroding the vitals of the moral world, and deba&s;ing all that is noble in man.</P>
<P>If I mention &s;ome traits which are rather peculiar to the Roman Catholic con&s;titution,
<PB N="44" REF="024075_0047_0FC31C411435FB10">
it is becau&s;e that is the predominant church in tho&s;e parts of Europe, where revolutions are &s;oone&s;t expected; and not becau&s;e it is any wor&s;e or any better than any other that ever has or ever can exi&s;t. I hinted before, and it may not be ami&s;s to repeat, that the hierarchy is every where the &s;ame, &s;o far as the circum&s;tances of &s;ociety will permit; for it borrows and lends, and interchanges its features in &s;ome mea&s;ure with the age and na|tion with which it has to deal, without ever lo&s;ing &s;ight of its object. It is every where the &s;ame engine of &s;tate; and whether it be guided by a Lama or a Mu&s;ti, by a Ponti|fex or a Pope, by a Bramin a Bi&s;hop or a Druid, it is entitled to an equal &s;hare of re|&s;pect.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t great object of the prie&s;t is to e|&s;tabli&s;h a belief in the minds of the people, that <HI>he him&s;elf is po&s;&s;e&s;t of &s;upernatural pow|ers;</HI> and the church at all times has made its way in the world, in proportion as the prie&s;t has &s;ucceeded in this particular. This is the foundation of every thing&mdash;the life and &s;oul of all that is &s;ubver&s;ive and unaccountable in human affairs; it is introducing a new ele|ment into &s;ociety; it is the rudder under the water, &s;teering the &s;hip almo&s;t directly con|trary to the wind that gives it motion.</P>
<P>A belief in the &s;upernatural powers of the prie&s;t has been in&s;pired by means, which in different nations have been known by different names,
<PB N="45" REF="024075_0048_0FC31C456C2F3BC8">
&s;uch as a&s;trologies, auguries, oracles or incan|tations. This article once e&s;tabli&s;hed, its continuation is not a difficult ta&s;k For as the church acquires wealth, it furni&s;hes it&s;elf with the nece&s;&s;ary apparatus, and the trade is carried on to advantage. The impo&s;ition too becomes more ea&s;y from the authority of precedent, by which the inqui&s;itive faculties of the mind are benumbed; men believe by pre&s;cription, and orthodoxy is hereditary.</P>
<P>In this manner every nation of antiquity received the poi&s;on in its infancy, and was rendered incapable of acquiring a vigorous manhood, of &s;peaking a national will, or of acting with that dignity and genero&s;ity, which are natural to man in &s;ociety. The moment that Romulus con&s;ulted the oracles for the building of his city, that moment he inter|dicted its future citizens the enjoyment of liberty among them&s;elves, as well as all ideas of ju&s;tice towards their neighbors. Men never act their own opinions in company with tho&s;e who can give them the opinions of gods; and as long as governors have an e&s;tabli&s;hed mode of con&s;ulting the au&s;pices, there is no nece&s;&s;ity to e&s;tabli&s;h any mode of con&s;ulting the people. <HI>Nihil publice &s;ine au&s;piciis nec domi nec militioe gerebatur</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Cicero de divinatione.</HI> Lib.

<PB N="46" REF="024075_0049_0FC317735AF20688">
this kind. Nothing is more pious, peaceful and moderate in appearance; and nothing more &s;avage and abominable in its operation. But it is a genuine <HI>church maxim,</HI> and, as &s;uch, de&s;erves a further con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>One obvious tendency of this maxim is, like the feudal rights, to inculcate radical ideas of inequalities among men; and it does this in a much greater degree. The feudal di&s;tance between man and man is perceptible and definite; but the moment you give one member of &s;ociety a familiar intercour&s;e with God, you launch him into the region of infini|ties and invi&s;ibilities; you unfit him and his bre|thern to live together on any terms but tho&s;e of &s;tupid reverence and of in&s;olent abu&s;e.</P>
<P>Another tendency is to make men cruel and &s;avage in a preternatural degree. When a per&s;on believes that he is doing the immedi|ate work of God, he dive&s;ts him&s;elf of the feelings of a man. And an ambitious Gene|ral, who wi&s;hes to extirpate or to plunder a neighboring nation, has only to order the prie&s;t to do his duty and &s;et the people at work by an oracle; they then know no other bounds to their frenzy than the will of their leader, pronounced by the prie&s;t; who&s;e voice to them is the voice of God. In this ca&s;e the lea&s;t attention to mercy or ju&s;tice would be abhorred as a di&s;obedience to the divine command. This circum&s;tance alone is &s;ufficient to account for two-thirds of the
<PB N="47" REF="024075_0050_0FC3177494BB3C58">
cruelty of all wars&mdash;perhaps in a great mea&s;ure for their exi&s;tence&mdash;and has given ri&s;e to an opinion, that nations are cruel in proportion as they are religious. But the ob&s;ervation ought to &s;tand thus, <HI>That nations are cruel in proportion as they are guided by prie&s;ts</HI>; than which there is no axiom more undeniably without exception.</P>
<P>Another tendency of governing men by oracles, is to make them factious and turbu|lent in the u&s;e of liberty, when they feel them&s;elves in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it. In all ancient democracies, the great body of the people enjoyed no liberty at all; and tho&s;e who were called freemen exerci&s;ed it only by &s;tarts, for the purpo&s;e of <HI>revenging</HI> injuries &mdash;not in a regular con&s;tituted mode of <HI>pre|venting</HI> them; the body politic u&s;ed liberty as a medicine, and not as daily bread. Hence it has happened, that the hi&s;tory of ancient democracies and of modern in&s;urrections are quoted upon us, to the in&s;ult of common &s;en&s;e, to prove that a whole people is not capable of governing it&s;elf. The whole of the rea&s;on|ing on this &s;ubject, from the profound di&s;|qui&s;itions of Ari&s;totle, down to the puny whin|ings of Dr. Tatham <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It may be nece&s;&s;ary to inform the reader, that Dr. Tatham of Oxford has written a book in defence of Royalty and Mr. Burke. As this is the la&s;t as well as weake&s;t thing again&s;t li|berty that I have met with, it is mentioned in the text for the &s;ake of widening the gra&s;p of my a&s;&s;ertion, as well as for height|ening the contra&s;t among all po&s;&s;ible authors.</NOTE>, are founded on a di|rect

Habitual freedom pro|duces effects directly the rever&s;e in every par|ticular. For a proof of this, look into Ame|rica; or if that be too much trouble, look into human nature with the eyes of common &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>When the Chri&s;tian religion was perverted and pre&s;&s;ed into the &s;ervice of Government, under the name of the <HI>Chri&s;tian Church,</HI> it became nece&s;&s;ary that its prie&s;ts &s;hould &s;et up for &s;upernatural powers, and inve&s;t them|&s;elves in the &s;ame cloak of infalibility, of which they had &s;tripped their predece&s;&s;ors, the Druids and the Augurs. This they effected by miracles; for which they gained &s;o great a reputation, that they were canonized after death, and have furni&s;hed modern Europe with a much greater catalogue of &s;aints, than could be found in any breviary of the anci|ents. The polythei&s;m of the Catholic Church is more &s;plendid for the number of its divini|ties, than that of the Eleu&s;inian; and they are not inferior in point of attributes. The Denis of France is at lea&s;t equal to the Ju|piter of Greece or the Apis of Egypt. As to &s;upernatural powers, the ca&s;e is preci&s;ely the
<PB N="49" REF="024075_0052_0FC3178609753038">
&s;ame in both; and the portions of infalibility are dealt out from the Pope to the &s;ubordi|nate prie&s;ts, according to their rank, in &s;uch a manner as to complete the harmony of the &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>Cicero has written with as much judgment and erudition on the "corruptions" of the old Roman Church, as Dr. Prie&s;tly has on tho&s;e of the new. But it is not the <HI>church</HI> which is corrupted by men, it is <HI>men</HI> who are cor|rupted by the church; for the very exi&s;tence of a church, as I have before defined it, is founded on a lie; it &s;ets out with the bla&s;phe|my of giving to one cla&s;s of men the attributes of God; and the practi&s;ing of the&s;e &s;orce|ries by that cla&s;s, and believing them by an|other, corrupts and vitiates the whole.</P>
<P>One of the mo&s;t admirable contrivances of the Chri&s;tian Church is the bu&s;ine&s;s of <HI>con|fe&s;&s;ions.</HI> It requires great reflection to give us an idea of the effects wrought on &s;ociety by this part of the machinery. It is a &s;olemn recognition of the &s;upernatural powers of the prie&s;t, repeated every day in the year by every human creature above the age of twelve years. Nothing is more natural than for men to judge of every thing around them, and even of them&s;elves, by <HI>compari&s;on;</HI> and in this ca&s;e what opinion are the laity to form of their own dignity?

<P>Another contrivance of the &s;ame &s;ort, and little inferior in efficacy, is the law of <HI>celibacy</HI> impo&s;ed on the prie&s;thood, both male and fe|male, in almo&s;t all church-e&s;tabli&s;hments that have hitherto exi&s;ted. The prie&s;t in the fir&s;t place armed with the weapons of moral de|&s;truction, by which he is made the profe&s;&s;ion|al enemy of his fellow men; and then, for fear he &s;hould neglect to u&s;e tho&s;e weapons&mdash;for fear he &s;hould contract the feelings and friend|&s;hips of rational beings, by mingling with &s;o|ciety and becoming one of its members&mdash; for fear his impo&s;itions &s;hould be di&s;covered by the intimacy of family connections,&mdash; he is interdicted the mo&s;t cordial endear|ments of life; he is &s;evered from the &s;ympa|thies of his fellow-creatures, and yet com|pelled

to be with them; his affections are held in the <HI>mortmain</HI> of perpetual inactivity; and, like the dead men of Mezentius, he is la&s;hed to &s;ociety for tyranny and contami|nation.</P>
<P>The whole of this management, in &s;elect|ing, preparing and organizing the members of the eccle&s;ia&s;tical body, is pur&s;ued with the &s;ame uniform, cold-blooded ho&s;tility a|gain&s;t the &s;ocial harmonies of life. The &s;ub|jects are taken from the younger &s;ons of no|ble families, who from their birth are con|&s;idered as a nui&s;ance to the hou&s;e, and an outca&s;t from parental attachment. They are then cut off from all opportunities of forming fraternal affections, and educated in a cloi|&s;ter; till they enter upon their public functi|ons, as di&s;connected from the feelings of the community, as it is de&s;igned they &s;hall ever remain from its intere&s;ts.</P>
<P>I will not mention the corruption of mo|rals, which mu&s;t re&s;ult from the combined cau&s;es of the ardent pa&s;&s;ions of con&s;trained celibacy, and the &s;ecret interviews of the prie&s;t with the women of his charge, for the purpo&s;e of confe&s;&s;ions; I will draw no ar|guments from the di&s;&s;entions &s;own in families; the jealou&s;ies and con&s;equent aberrations of hu&s;band and wife, occa&s;ioned by an intrigu|ing &s;tranger being in the &s;ecrets of both; the di&s;couragements laid upon matrimony by a ge|neral dread of the&s;e con&s;equences in the minds

of men of reflection&mdash;effects which are re|markable in all catholic countries; but I will conclude this article by ob&s;erving the direct influence that eccle&s;ia&s;tical celibacy alone has had on the population of Europe.</P>
<P>This policy of the church mu&s;t have pro|duced at lea&s;t as great an effect, in thinning &s;ociety, as the whole of her wars and per&s;e|cutions. In Catholic Europe there mu&s;t be near a million of eccle&s;ia&s;tics. This propor|tion of mankind continuing deducted from the agents of population for fifteen centuries, mu&s;t have precluded the exi&s;tence of more than one hundred millions of the human &s;pecies.</P>
<P>Should the reader be di&s;po&s;ed on this re|mark to li&s;ten to the reply which is &s;ometimes made, that Europe is &s;ufficiently populous; I beg he would &s;u&s;pend his deci&s;ion, till he &s;hall &s;ee what may be &s;aid, in the cour&s;e of this work, on protected indu&s;try; and until he &s;hall well con&s;ider the effects of liberty on the means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. That reply is cer|tainly one of the axioms of tyranny, and is of kin to the famous wi&s;h of Caligula, that the whole Roman people had but one neck.</P>
<P>The French have gone as far in the de|&s;truction of the hierarchy as could have been expected, con&s;idering the habits of the peo|ple and the pre&s;ent circum&s;tances of Europe. The church in that country was like royalty &mdash;the prejudices in its favor were too &s;trong
<PB N="53" REF="024075_0056_0FC3179BBA9CEDB8">
to be vanqui&s;hed all at once. The mo&s;t that could be done, was to tear the bandage from the eyes of mankind, break the charm of in|equality, demoli&s;h ranks and infalibilities, and teach the people that mitres and crowns did not confer &s;upernatural powers. As long as public teachers are cho&s;en by the people, are &s;alaried and removeable by the people, are born and married among the people, have families to be educated and protected from oppre&s;&s;ion and from vice,&mdash;as long as they have all the common &s;ympathies of &s;ociety to bind them to the public intere&s;t, there is ve|ry little danger of their becoming tyrants by force; and the liberty of the pre&s;s will pre|vent their being &s;o by craft.</P>
<P>In the United States of America there is no church; and this is one of the principal circum&s;tances which di&s;tingui&s;h that govern|ment from all others that ever exi&s;ted; it en&s;ures the un-embarra&s;&s;ed exerci&s;e of reli|gion, the continuation of public in&s;truction in the &s;cience of liberty and happine&s;s, and promi&s;es a long duration to a repre&s;entative government.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE church, in all modern Europe, may be con&s;idered as a kind of &s;tanding ar|my; as the members of that community have been in every nation, the &s;ure&s;t &s;upporters of arbitrary power, both for internal oppre&s;|&s;ion and for external violence. But this not being &s;ufficient of it&s;elf, an additional in&s;tru|ment, to be known by the name of the <HI>mili|tary &s;y&s;tem,</HI> became nece&s;&s;ary; and it &s;eems to have been expedient to call up another element of human nature, out of which this new in&s;trument might be created and maintained. The church was in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;tronge&s;t ground that could be taken in the human mind, the <HI>principle of religion</HI>; a principle dealing with things invi&s;ible; and con&s;e|quently the mo&s;t capable of being it&s;elf per|verted, and then of perverting the whole mind, and &s;ubjecting it to any unrea&s;onable pur&s;uit.</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="024075_0058_0FC3179F4B0D0E48">Next to that of religion, and &s;imilar to it in mo&s;t of its characteri&s;tics, is the principle of <HI>honor.</HI> Honor, like religion, is an origi|nal, indelible &s;entiment of the mind, an indi&s;|pen&s;able ingredient in our nature. But its object is incapable of preci&s;e definition; and con&s;equently, though given us in aid of the more definable feelings of morality, it is ca|pable of total perver&s;ion, of lo&s;ing &s;ight of its own original nature, and &s;till retaining its name; of pur&s;uing the de&s;truction of moral &s;entiments, in&s;tead of being their ornament; of deba&s;ing, in&s;tead of &s;upporting, the dignity of man.</P>
<P>This camelion principle was therefore a proper element of impo&s;ition, and was de|&s;tined to make an immen&s;e figure in the world, as the foundation and &s;upport of the military &s;y&s;tem of all unequal governments. We mu&s;t look pretty far into human nature, be|fore we &s;hall di&s;cover the cau&s;e, why killing men in battle &s;hould be deemed, <HI>in it&s;elf,</HI> an honorable employment. A hangman is uni|ver&s;ally de&s;pi&s;ed; he exerci&s;es an office which not only the feelings but the policy of all na|tions have agreed to regard as infamous. What is it that &s;hould make the difference of the&s;e two occupations in favor of the for|mer? Surely it is not becau&s;e the victims in the former ca&s;e are <HI>innocent,</HI> and in the latter <HI>guilty.</HI> To a&s;&s;ert this, would be a greater libel upon human &s;ociety than I can bring
<PB N="56" REF="024075_0059_0FC317A620EFF608">
my&s;elf to utter; it would make the tyranny of opinion the mo&s;t <HI>dete&s;table,</HI> as well as the mo&s;t &s;overeign of all po&s;&s;ible tyrannies. But what can it be? It is not, what is &s;ometimes alledged, that <HI>courage</HI> is the foundation of the bu&s;ine&s;s; that fighting is honorable becau&s;e is is dangerous; there is often as much cou|rage di&s;played in highway-robbery, as in the warme&s;t conflict of armies; and yet it does no honor to the party; a Robin Hood is as di&s;honorable a character as a Jack Ketch. It is not becau&s;e there is any idea of <HI>ju&s;tice</HI> or <HI>hone&s;ty</HI> in the ca&s;e; for to &s;ay the be&s;t that can be &s;aid of war, it is impo&s;&s;ible that more than one &s;ide can be ju&s;t or hone&s;t; and yet both &s;ides of every conte&s;t are equally the road to &s;ame; where a di&s;tingui&s;hed killer of men is &s;ure to gain immortal honor. It is not <HI>patrioti&s;m,</HI> even in that &s;en&s;e of the word which deviates the mo&s;t from general philan|thropy; for a total &s;tranger to both parties in a war, may enter into it on either &s;ide as a volunteer, perform more than a vulgar &s;hare of the &s;laughter, and be for ever applauded, even by his enemies. Finally, it is not from any pecuniary advantages that are ordinarily attached to the profe&s;&s;ion of arms; for &s;ol|diers are generally poor, though part of their bu&s;ine&s;s be to plunder.</P>
<P>Indeed, I can &s;ee but one rea&s;on in nature, why the principle of honor &s;hould be &s;e|lected from all human incentives, and relied
<PB N="57" REF="024075_0060_0FC317A7A1D10F08">
on for the &s;upport of the military &s;y&s;tem: it is becau&s;e it was <HI>convenient for the governing power</HI>; that power being in the hands of a &s;mall part of the community who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s was to &s;upport it by impo&s;ition. No princi|ple of a permanent nature, who&s;e object is unequivocal, and who&s;e &s;lighte&s;t deviations are perceptible, would have an&s;wered the purpo&s;e. Ju&s;tice, for in&s;tance, is a principle of common u&s;e, of which every man can di&s;|cern the application. Should the prince &s;ay it was <HI>ju&s;t,</HI> to commence an unprovoked war with his weak neighbors and plunder their country, the fal&s;hood would be too glaring; all men would judge for them&s;elves, and give him the lie; and no man would follow his &s;tandard, unle&s;s bribed by his avarice. But honor is of another nature; it is what we all can feel, but no one can define; it is therefore whatever the prince may choo&s;e to name it; and &s;o powerful is its operation, that all the u&s;eful &s;entiments of life lo&s;e their effect; morality is not only bani&s;hed from political cabinets, but generally and profe&s;|&s;ionally from the bo&s;oms of men who pur&s;ue honor in the profe&s;&s;ion of arms.</P>
<P>It is common for a king, who wi&s;hes to make a thing fa&s;hionable, to practi&s;e it him&s;elf; and in this he is &s;ure of general imi|tation and &s;ucce&s;s. As this divice is extreme|ly natural, and as the exi&s;tence of wars is ab|&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to the exi&s;tence of kings;
<PB N="58" REF="024075_0061_0FC317A927AED040">
to give a fa&s;hion to the trade mu&s;t have been a con&s;iderable motive to the ancient kings, for expo&s;ing them&s;elves &s;o much as they u&s;u|ally did in battle. They &s;aid, <HI>let human &s;laughter be honorable,</HI> and honorable it was.</P>
<P>Hence it is, that warriors have been term|ed heroes; and the eulogy of heroes has been the con&s;tant bu&s;ine&s;s of hi&s;torians and poets, from the days of Nimrod down to the pre&s;ent century. Homer, for his a&s;toni&s;hing variety, animation, and &s;ublimity, has not a warmer admirer than my&s;elf; he has been for three thou&s;and years, like a reigning &s;o|vereign, applauded as a matter of cour&s;e, whether from love or fear; for no man with &s;afety to his own character can refu&s;e to join the chorus of his prai&s;e. I never can expre&s;s (and his other admirers have not done it for me) the plea&s;ure I receive from his poems; but in a view of philanthropy, I con&s;ider his exi&s;tence as having been a &s;erious misfortune to the human race. He has given to military life a charm which few men can re&s;i&s;t, a &s;plen|dor which envelopes the &s;cenes of carnage in a cloud of glory, which dazzles the eyes of every beholder, &s;teals from us our natural &s;en&s;ibilities in exchange for the artificial, deba&s;es men to brutes under the pretext of exalting them to gods, and obliterates with the &s;ame irre&s;i&s;table &s;troke the moral duties of life and the true policy of nations.

Alexander <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is not unworthy of remark, that Ari&s;totle was the tutor of Alexander, and the mo&s;t &s;plendid editor and commentator of Homer. As we mu&s;t judge an author by his works, it is but fair to take into view the whole of his works. Con&s;idered therefore as a political &s;chool-ma&s;ter to the world, the forming of his pupil and the illu&s;trating of his poet are the greate&s;t fruits of the indu&s;try of that philo&s;opher, and have had much more influence on the affairs of nation than his treaiti&s;e that bears the name of <HI>politics.</HI></NOTE> is not the only human mon&s;ter that has been formed after the model of Achilles; nor Per&s;ia and Egypt the only countries depopulated for no other rea&s;on than the de&s;ire of rivalling predece&s;&s;ors in military fame.</P>
<P>Another device of princes, to render ho|norable the profe&s;&s;ion of arms, was to make it enviable, by depriving the lowe&s;t orders of &s;ociety of the power of becoming &s;oldiers. Excluding the helots of all nations from any part in the glory of butchering their fellow-creatures, has had the &s;ame effect as in Spar|ta&mdash;it has ennobled the trade; and this is the true feudal e&s;timation, in which this trade has de&s;cended to us from our Gothic ance&s;tors.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time that the feudal &s;y&s;tem was furni&s;hing Europe with a numerous body of noble&s;&s;e, it became nece&s;&s;ary, for various purpo&s;es of de&s;poti&s;m, that they &s;hould be prevented from mingling with the common ma&s;s of &s;ociety, that they &s;hould be held to|gether by what they call <HI>l'e&s;prit de corps,</HI> or the corporation &s;pirit, and be furni&s;hed with occupations which &s;hould leave them nothing
<PB N="60" REF="024075_0063_0FC317B517406098">
in common with their fellow men. The&s;e occupations were offered by the church and the army; and as the former was permanent, it was thought expedient to give permanency to the latter. Thus the military &s;y&s;tem has created the noble&s;&s;e, and the noble&s;&s;e the military &s;y&s;tem. They are mutually nece&s;|&s;ary to each other's exi&s;tence&mdash;concurrent and reciprocal cau&s;es and effects, generating and generated, perpetuating each other by interchangeable wants, and both indi&s;pen&s;a|ble to the governing power.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e per&s;ons therefore who undertake to defend the noble&s;&s;e as a nece&s;&s;ary order in the great community of men, ought to be appri&s;ed of the extent of their undertaking. They mu&s;t, in the fir&s;t place, defend <HI>&s;tanding armies,</HI> and that too upon principles, not of national prudence, as relative to the circum|&s;tances of neighbors, but of internal nece&s;&s;ity, as relative only to the organization of &s;ociety. They mu&s;t at the &s;ame time extend their ar|guments to the increa&s;e of tho&s;e armies; for they infallibly mu&s;t increa&s;e to a degree be|yond our ordinary calculation, or they will not an&s;wer the purpo&s;e; both becau&s;e the number of the noble&s;&s;e, or "the men of the &s;word" (as they are properly &s;tyled by their friend Burke) is con&s;tantly augmenting, and becau&s;e the influence of the church is on the decline. As the light of philo&s;ophy illumi|nates the world, it &s;hines in upon the &s;ecrets
<PB N="61" REF="024075_0064_0FC317B69951A0E0">
of government; and it is nece&s;&s;ary to make the blind as broad as the window, or the pa&s;|&s;engers will &s;ee what is doing in the cabinet. The means of impo&s;ition mu&s;t be increa&s;ed in the army, in proportion a they are lo&s;t in the church.</P>
<P>Secondly, they mu&s;t vindicate <HI>war,</HI> not merely as an occurrence of fatality, and ju&s;|tifiable on the defen&s;ive; but as a thing of choice, as being the mo&s;t nutritious aliment of that kind of government which requires privileged orders and an army: for it is no great figure of &s;peech, to &s;ay that the nobi|lity of Europe are always fed upon human gore. They originated in war, they live by war, and without war it would be impo&s;&s;ible to keep them from &s;tarving. Or, to drop the figure entirely, if mankind were left to the peaceable pur&s;uit of indu&s;try, the titled or|ders would lo&s;e their di&s;tinctions, mingle with &s;ociety, and become rea&s;onable creatures.</P>
<P>Thirdly, they mu&s;t defend the <HI>honor</HI> of the occupation which is allotted to the no|ble&s;&s;e. For the age is becoming extremely &s;ceptical on this &s;ubject; there are heretics in the world (Mr. Burke calls them athei&s;ts) who affect to di&s;believe that men were made expre&s;ly for the purpo&s;e of cutting each other's throats; and who &s;ay that it is not the highe&s;t honor that a man can arrive at, to &s;ell him&s;elf to another man for life at a certain daily price, and to hold him&s;elf in readine&s;s, night and
<PB N="62" REF="024075_0065_0FC317BD56B8A298">
day, to kill individuals or nations, at home or abroad, without ever enquiring the cau&s;e. The&s;e men &s;ay, that it is no compliment to the judgment or humanity of a man, to lead &s;uch a life; and they do not &s;ee why a noble|man &s;hould not po&s;&s;e&s;s the&s;e qualities as well as other people.</P>
<P>Fourthly, they mu&s;t prove that all occupa|tions which tend to <HI>life,</HI> and not to <HI>death,</HI> are di&s;honorable and infamous. Agriculture, commerce, every method of augmenting the means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, and rai&s;ing men from the &s;avage &s;tate, mu&s;t be held ignoble; or el&s;e men of honor will forget them&s;elves &s;o far as to engage in them; and then farewell to di|&s;tinctions. The national a&s;&s;embly may then create orders as fa&s;t as it has ever uncreated them; it is impo&s;&s;ible for Nobility to exi&s;t, in France, or in any other country, unle&s;s the a|bove articles are firmly defended by argu|ments, and fixed in the minds of mankind:</P>
<P>It &s;eems difficult for a man of reflection to write one page on the &s;ubject of government, without meeting with &s;ome old e&s;tabli&s;hed max|ims, which are not only fal&s;e, but which are pre|ci&s;ely the rever&s;e of truth. Of this &s;ort is the opinion, That inevitable wars in modern times have given occa&s;ion to the pre&s;ent military &s;y&s;|tem, and that &s;tanding armies are the be&s;t means of preventing wars. This is what the people of Europe are commanded to believe. With all due deference, however, to their command|ers,
<PB N="63" REF="024075_0066_0FC317C54CB73FC0">
I would propo&s;e a contrary belief, which I will venture to lay down as the true &s;tate of the fact: <HI>That the pre&s;ent military &s;y&s;tem has been the cau&s;e of the wars of modern times, and that &s;tanding armies are the be&s;t, if not the only means of</HI> PROMOTING <HI>wars.</HI> This po&s;ition has at lea&s;t one advantage over tho&s;e that are commonly e&s;tabli&s;hed by govern|ments, that it is believed by him who pro|po&s;es it to the a&s;&s;ent of others. Men who cannot command the power of the &s;tate, ought to enforce their doctrines by the power of Rea&s;on, and to ri&s;k on the &s;ea of opinion nothing more than what &s;he will take under her convoy.</P>
<P>To apply this maxim to the ca&s;e now be|fore us; let us a&s;k, <HI>What is war?</HI> and on what propen&s;ity in human nature does it re&s;t? for it is to MAN that we are to trace the&s;e que&s;tions, and not to <HI>princes</HI>; we mu&s;t drive them up to <HI>principle,</HI> and not &s;top &s;hort at <HI>precedent</HI>; and endeavor to u&s;e our &s;en&s;e, in&s;tead of parading our learning. Among individual men, or &s;avages acting in a de|&s;ultory manner, antecedent to the formation of great &s;ocieties, there may be many cau&s;es of quarrels and a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inations; &s;uch as love, jealou&s;y, rapine, or the revenge of private injuries. But the&s;e do not amount to the idea of war. War &s;uppo&s;es a va&s;t a&s;&s;ociation of men engaged in one cau&s;e, actuated by one &s;pirit, and carrying on a bloody conte&s;t
<PB N="64" REF="024075_0067_0FC317C98E94A698">
with another a&s;&s;ociation in a &s;imilar predica|ment. Few of the motives which actuate private men can apply at once to &s;uch a mul|titude, the greate&s;t part of which mu&s;t be per&s;onal &s;trangers to each other. Indeed, where the motives are clearly explained and well under&s;tood by the community at large, &s;o as to be really felt by the people, there is but one of the ordinary cau&s;es above menti|oned which can actuate &s;uch a body; it is <HI>rapine,</HI> or the hope of enriching them&s;elves by plunder. There can be then but two circum&s;tances under which a nation will com|mence an offen&s;ive war: either the people at large mu&s;t be thoroughly convinced that they &s;hall be per&s;onally rewarded not only with conque&s;t, but with a va&s;t &s;hare of wealth from the conquered nation, or el&s;e they mu&s;t be duped into the war by tho&s;e who hold the reigns of government. All motives for nati|onal offences are reduced to the&s;e two, and there can be no more. The &s;ubject, like mo&s;t others, becomes extremely &s;imple, the moment it is con&s;idered.</P>
<P>And how many of the wars of mankind o|riginate in the fir&s;t of the&s;e motives? Among civilized nations, none. A people con&s;i|derably numerous, approaching towards ideas of &s;ober policy, and beginning to ta&s;te the fruits of indu&s;try, require but little experi|ence to convince them&s;elves of the following truths&mdash;that no benefit can be derived to the
<PB N="65" REF="024075_0068_0FC317CADC2D8428">
great body of individuals from conque&s;t though it were certain&mdash;that this event is al|ways doubtful, and the deci&s;ion to be dreaded &mdash;that nine tenths of the lo&s;&s;es in all wars are a <HI>clear</HI> lo&s;s to both parties, being &s;unk in ex|pences&mdash;that the remaining tenth nece&s;&s;arily comes into the hands of the principal mana|gers, and produces a real misfortune even to the victorious party, by giving them ma&s;ters at home, in&s;tead of riches from abroad.</P>
<P>The pitiful idea of fea&s;ting our&s;elves on a compari&s;on of &s;uffering, and balancing our own lo&s;&s;es by tho&s;e of the enemy, is a &s;trata|gem of government, a calculation of cabinet arithmetic. Individuals rea&s;on not in this manner. A di&s;tre&s;&s;ed mother in England, reduced from a full to a &s;canty diet, and be|wailing the lo&s;s of her &s;on, receives no con&s;o|lation from being told of a woman in France, who&s;e &s;on &s;ell in the &s;ame battle, and that the taxes are equally increa&s;ed in both countries by the &s;ame war. But kings, and mini&s;ters, and generals, and hi&s;torians proclaim, as a glorious conte&s;t, every war which appears to have been as fatal to the enemy as to their own party, though one half of each nation are &s;laughtered in the field, and the other half reduced to &s;lavery. This is one of the bare-faced impo&s;itions with which mankind are perpetually in&s;ulted, and which call upon us, in the name of humanity, to pur&s;ue this enquiry into the cau&s;es of war.</P>

<P>The &s;ame may be &s;aid of modern Europe, after a corre&s;ponding period in the progre&s;s of nations; which period &s;hould be placed at the very commencement of civilization. Perhaps after the &s;ettlement of the Saracens in Spain, the Lombards in Italy, the Franks in Gaul, and the Saxons in England, we &s;hould have heard no more of offen&s;ive ope|rations, had they depended on the uninflu|enced wi&s;hes of the people. For we are not to regard as <HI>offen&s;ive</HI> the &s;truggles of a nation for the recovery of liberty.</P>
<P>What an inconceivable ma&s;s of &s;laughter are we then to place to the other account; to dark unequal government! to the magical powers po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by a few men of blinding the eyes of the community, and leading the people to de&s;truction by tho&s;e who are called their fathers and their friends!

without a permanent re&s;ource. As long as the military conditions of feudal tenures re|mained in full vigor, they were &s;ure to furni&s;h the means of de&s;truction to follow the will of the &s;overeign; but as the a&s;perities of this &s;y&s;tem &s;oftened away by degrees, it &s;eems that governments were threatened with the nece&s;&s;ity of applying to the people at large for voluntary enli&s;tments, and contributions in money; on which application the purpo&s;e mu&s;t be declared. This would be too direct an appeal to the con&s;ciences of men on a que&s;tion of offen&s;ive war, and was, if po&s;&s;ible, to be avoided. For even the power of the church, where there was no que&s;tion of he|re&s;y, could not be always relied on, to &s;ti|mulate to a quarrel with their neighbors of the &s;ame faith; and &s;till le&s;s was it &s;ure of induc|ing them to part with their money. The ex|pedient therefore of &s;tanding armies became nece&s;&s;ary; and perhaps rather on account of the money than the men. Thus money is re|quired to levy armies, and armies to levy money; and foreign wars are introduced as the pretended occa&s;ion for both.</P>
<P>One general character will apply to much the greater part of the wars of modern times, &mdash;they are <HI>political</HI> and not <HI>vindictive.</HI> This alone is &s;ufficient to account for their real origin, they are wars of agreement<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Whenever the real &s;ecret hi&s;tory of the Engli&s;h and Spani&s;h armaments of 1790 &s;hall be publi&s;hed to the world, though it may not furni&s;h new arguments to men of reflection for di&s;tru&s;t|ing political cabinets, it may at lea&s;t increa&s;e the number of &s;uch men.

rather than of di&s;&s;ention; and the conque&s;t is taxes, and not territory. To carry on this bu&s;ine&s;s, it is nece&s;&s;ary not only to keep up the military &s;pirit of the noble&s;&s;e by titles and pen&s;ions, and to keep in pay a va&s;t num|ber of troops, who know no other God but their king; who lo&s;e all ideas of them&s;elves, in contemplating their officers; and who for|get the duties of a man, to practi&s;e tho&s;e of a &s;oldier&mdash;this is but half the operation: an e&s;&s;ential part of the military &s;y&s;tem is to di&s;|arm the people, to hold all the functions of war, as well the arm that executes, as the will that declares it, equally above their reach. This part of the &s;y&s;tem has a double effect, it pal&s;ies the hand and brutalizes the mind; an habitual di&s;u&s;e of phy&s;ical forces totally de|&s;troys the moral; and men lo&s;e at once the power of protecting them&s;elves, and of di&s;|cerning the cau&s;e of their oppre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>It is almo&s;t u&s;ele&s;s to mention the conclu|&s;ions which every rational mind mu&s;t draw from the&s;e con&s;iderations. But though they are too obvious to be mi&s;taken, they are &s;till too important to be pa&s;&s;ed over in &s;ilence; for we &s;eem to be arrived at that epoch in
<PB N="69" REF="024075_0072_0FC317DA01CB1758">
human affairs, when "all u&s;eful ideas, and truths the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary to the happine&s;s of mankind, are no longer exclu&s;ively de&s;tined to adorn the pages of a book <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>L'A&s;&s;emblee nationale.</HI></NOTE>." Nations, wearied out with impo&s;ture, begin to pro|vide for the &s;afety of man, in&s;tead of pur&s;u|ing his de&s;truction.</P>
<P>I will mention as one conclu&s;ion, which bids fair to be a practical one, that the way to prevent wars is not merely to change the military &s;y&s;tem; for that, like the church, is a nece&s;&s;ary part of the governments as they now &s;tand, and of &s;ociety as now organized: but the <HI>principle of government</HI> mu&s;t be com|pletely changed; and the con&s;equence of this will be &s;uch a total renovation of &s;ociety, as to bani&s;h &s;tanding armies, overturn the military &s;y&s;tem, and exclude the po&s;&s;ibility of war.</P>
<P>Only admit the original, unalterable truth, <HI>that all men are equal in their rights,</HI> and the foundation of every thing is laid; to build the &s;uper&s;tructure requires no effort but that of natural deduction. The fir&s;t nece&s;&s;ary deduction will be, that the people will form an equal repre&s;entative government; in which it will be impo&s;&s;ible for <HI>orders</HI> or <HI>privileges</HI> to exi&s;t for a moment; and con&s;equently the fir&s;t materials for &s;tanding armies will be con|verted into peaceable members of the &s;tate. Another deduction follows, That the people
<PB N="70" REF="024075_0073_0FC317E447350C08">
will be univer&s;ally armed: they will a&s;&s;ume tho&s;e weapons for &s;ecurity, which the art of war has invented for de&s;truction. You will then have removed the <HI>nece&s;&s;ity</HI> of a &s;tand|ing army by the organization of the legi&s;la|ture, and the <HI>po&s;&s;iblity</HI> of it by the arrange|ment of the militia; for it is as impo&s;&s;ible for an armed &s;oldiery to exi&s;t in an armed na|tion, as for a nobility to exi&s;t under an equal government.</P>
<P>It is curious to remark how ill we rea&s;on on human nature, from being accu&s;tomed to view it under the di&s;gui&s;e which the unequal governments of the world have always im|po&s;ed upon it. During the American war, and e&s;pecially towards its clo&s;e, General Wa&s;hington might be &s;aid to po&s;&s;e&s;s the hearts of all the Americans. His recommendation was law, and he was able to command the whole power of that people for any purpo&s;e of defence. The philo&s;ophers of Europe con&s;idered this as a dangerous cri&s;is to the cau&s;e of freedom. They <HI>knew,</HI> from the example of Cae&s;ar and Sylla and Marius and Alcibiades and Pericles and Cromwell, that Wa&s;hington would never lay down his arms till he had given his country a ma&s;ter. But after he did lay them down, then came the miracle&mdash;his virtue was cried up to be more than human; and it is by this miracle of virtue in him, that the Americans are &s;up|po&s;ed to enjoy their liberty at this day.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="024075_0074_0FC317E57752D398">I believe the virtue of that great man to be equal to the highe&s;t human virtue that has ever yet been known; but to an American eye no extraordinary portion of it could ap|pear in that tran&s;action. It would have been impo&s;&s;ible for the general or the army to have continued in the field after the enemy left it; for the &s;oldiers were all <HI>citizens</HI>; and if it had been otherwi&s;e, their numbers were not the hundredth part of the citizens at large who were all <HI>&s;oldiers.</HI> To &s;ay that he was wi&s;e in di&s;cerning the impo&s;&s;ibility of &s;ucce&s;s in an attempt to imitate the great heroes a|bove-mentioned, is to give him only the &s;ame merit for &s;agacity which is common to every other per&s;on who knows that country, or who has well con&s;idered the effects of equal liberty.</P>
<P>Though infinite prai&s;e is due to the con|&s;tituting a&s;&s;embly of France for the tempe|rate re&s;olution and manly firmne&s;s which mark their operations in general; yet it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed that &s;ome of their reforms bear the marks of too timorous a hand. Pre&s;erv|ing an hereditary king with a tremendous ac|cumulation of powers, and providing an un|nece&s;&s;ary number of prie&s;ts, to be paid from the national pur&s;e, and furni&s;hed with the means of rebuilding the half-de&s;troyed ruins of the hierarchy, are circum&s;tances to be pardoned for rea&s;ons which I have already hinted. But the enormous military force,
<PB N="72" REF="024075_0075_0FC317E6B1DB88D8">
which they have decreed &s;hall remain as a permanent e&s;tabli&s;hment, appears to me not only unnece&s;&s;ary, and even dangerous to li|berty, but totally and directly &s;ubver&s;ive of the end they had in view. Their objects were the &s;ecurity of the frontiers and the tranquility of the &s;tate; the rever&s;e of this will be the effect&mdash;not perhaps that this army will be turned again&s;t the people, or involve the &s;tate in offen&s;ive wars. On the contrary, &s;uppo&s;e that it &s;imply and faithfully defends the frontiers and protects the people; this defence and this protection are the evils of which I complain. They tend to weaken the nation, by deadening the &s;pirit of the peo|ple, and teaching them to look up to others for protection, in&s;tead of depending on their own invincible arm. A people that legi&s;late for them&s;elves ought to be in the habit of protecting them&s;elves; or they will lo&s;e the &s;pirit of both. A knowledge of their own <HI>&s;trength</HI> pre&s;erves a temperance in their own <HI>wi&s;dom,</HI> and the performance of their <HI>duties</HI> gives a value to their <HI>rights.</HI></P>
<P>This is likewi&s;e the way to increa&s;e the &s;olid dome&s;tic force of a nation, to a degree far beyond any ideas we form of a &s;tanding army; and at the &s;ame time to annihilate its capacity as well as inclination for foreign aggre&s;&s;ive ho&s;tilities. The true guarantee of perpetual tranquility at home and abroad, in &s;uch a ca&s;e, would ari&s;e from this truth,
<PB N="73" REF="024075_0076_0FC317E82DA0AA00">
which would pa&s;s into an incontrovertible maxim, that offen&s;ive operations would be impo&s;&s;ible, and defen&s;ive ones infallible.</P>
<P>This is undoubtedly the true and only &s;e|cret of exterminating wars from the face of the earth: and it mu&s;t afford no &s;mall degree of con&s;olation to every friend of humanity, to find this un&s;peakable ble&s;&s;ing re&s;ulting from that equal mode of government, which alone &s;ecures every other enjoyment for which mankind unite their intere&s;ts in &s;o|ciety. Politicians, and even &s;ometimes ho|ne&s;t men, are accu&s;tomed to &s;peak of war as an uncontrolable event, falling on the human race like a concu&s;&s;ion of the elements&mdash;a &s;courge which admits no remedy; but for which we mu&s;t wait with trembling prepara|tion, as for an epidemical di&s;ea&s;e, who&s;e force we may hope to lighten, but can never a|void. They &s;ay that mankind are wicked and rapacious, and "it mu&s;t be that offences will come." This rea&s;oning applies to in|dividuals, and to countries when governed by individuals; but not to nations delibe|rately &s;peaking a national voice. I hope I &s;hall not be under&s;tood to mean, that the nature of man is totally changed by living in a free republic. I allow that it is &s;till <HI>inte|re&s;ted</HI> men and <HI>pa&s;&s;ionate</HI> men, that direct the affairs of the world. But in national a&s;&s;em|blies, pa&s;&s;ion is lo&s;t in deliberation, and inte|re&s;t balances intere&s;t; till the good of the
<PB N="74" REF="024075_0077_0FC317F235B275C0">
whole community combines the general will. Here then is a great moral entity, acting &s;till from intere&s;ted motives; but who&s;e in|tere&s;t it never can be, in any po&s;&s;ible com|bination of circum&s;tances, to commence an offen&s;ive war.</P>
<P>There is another con&s;ideration, from which we may argue the total extinction of wars, as a nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence of e&s;tabli&s;hing govern|ments on the repre&s;entative wi&s;dom of the people. We are all &s;en&s;ible that &s;uper&s;ti|tion is a blemi&s;h of human nature, by no means confined to &s;ubjects connected with religion. Political &s;uper&s;tition is almo&s;t as &s;trong as religious; and it is quite as uni|ver&s;ally u&s;ed as an in&s;trument of tyranny. To enumerate the variety of ways in which this in&s;trument operates on the mind, would be more difficult, than to form a general idea of the re&s;ult of its operations. In monarchies, it induces men to &s;pill their blood for a particular family, or for a parti|cular branch of that family, who happens to have been born fir&s;t, or la&s;t, or to have been taught to repeat a certain creed, in pre|ference to other creeds. But the effect which I am going chiefly to notice, is that which re&s;pects the territorial boundaries of a go|vernment. For a man in Portugal or Spain to prefer belonging to one of tho&s;e nations rather than the other, is as much a &s;uper&s;ti|tion, as to prefer the hou&s;e of Braganza to
<PB N="75" REF="024075_0078_0FC317F41D8A83E8">
that of Bourbon, or Mary the &s;econd of England, to her brother. All the&s;e &s;ubjects of preference &s;tand upon the &s;ame footing as the turban and the hat, the cro&s;s and the cre&s;cent, or the lilly and the ro&s;e.</P>
<P>The boundaries of nations have been fixed for the accommodation of the <HI>government,</HI> without the lea&s;t regard to the convenience of the people. Kings and mini&s;ters, who make a profitable trade of governing, are intere&s;ted in extending the limits of their dominion as far as po&s;&s;ible. They have a property in the people, and in the territory that they cover. The country and its inhabitants are to them a farm &s;tocked with &s;heep. When they call up the&s;e &s;heep to be &s;heared, they teach them to know their names, to follow their ma&s;ter, and avoid a &s;tranger. By this unaccount|able impo&s;ition it is, that men are led from one extravagant folly to another&mdash;to adore their king, to boa&s;t of their nation, and to wi&s;h for conque&s;t&mdash;circum&s;tances equally ridiculous in them&s;elves, and equally incom|patible with that rational e&s;timation of things which ari&s;es from the &s;cience of liberty.</P>
<P>In America it is not &s;o. Among the &s;e|veral &s;tates, the governments are all equal in their force, and the people are all equal in their rights. Were it po&s;&s;ible for one &s;tate to conquer another &s;tate, without any expence of money, or of time, or of blood&mdash;neither of the &s;tates, nor a &s;ingle individual in either of them, would be richer or poorer for the
<PB N="76" REF="024075_0079_0FC317F59E270A38">
event. The people would all be upon their own lands, and engaged in their own occu|pations, as before; and whether the territory on which they live were called New-York or Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, is a matter of total indiffe|rence, about which they have no &s;uper&s;tition. For the people belong not to the govern|ment, but the government belongs to the people.</P>
<P>Since the independence of tho&s;e &s;tates, many territorial di&s;putes have been &s;ettled, which had ri&s;en from the interference of their ancient charters. The interference of char|ters is a kind of policy which, I &s;uppo&s;e, every mother country ob&s;erves towards her colonies, in order to give them a &s;ubject of contention; that &s;he may have the opportu|nity of keeping all parties quiet by the pa|rental ble&s;&s;ing of a &s;tanding army. But on the bani&s;hment of foreign controul, and all ideas of European policy, the enjoyment of equal liberty has taught the Americans the &s;ecret of &s;ettling the&s;e di&s;putes, with as much calmne&s;s as they have formed their con&s;titutions. It is found, that que&s;tions about the boundaries between free &s;tates are not matters of intere&s;t, but merely of form and convenience. And though the&s;e que&s;tions may involve a tract of country equal to an European kingdom, it alters not the ca&s;e; they are &s;ettled as merchants &s;ettle the cour&s;e of exchange between two commercial

Several in&s;tances have occurred, &s;ince the revolution, of deciding in a few days, by amicable arbitration, territorial di&s;|putes, which determine the juri&s;diction of larger and richer tracts of country, than have formed the objects of all the wars of the two la&s;t centuries between France and Ger|many.</P>
<P>It is needle&s;s to &s;pend any time in apply|ing this idea to the circum&s;tances of all coun|tries, where the government &s;hould be free|ly and habitually in the hands of the people.

For &s;uch a revolution cannot &s;top &s;hort of fixing the power of the &s;tate on the ba&s;is allotted by nature, the unalienable rights of man; which are the &s;ame in all countries.

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. The Admini&s;tration of Ju&s;tice.</HEAD>
<P>IT would be a curious &s;peculation, and per|haps as u&s;eful as curious, to con&s;ider how far the moral nature of man is effected by the organization of &s;ociety; and to what degree his predominant qualities depend on the nature of the government under which he lives. The adage, <HI>That men are every where the &s;ame,</HI> though not wholly fal&s;e, would doubtle&s;s be found to be true only in a limit|ed &s;en&s;e. I love to indulge the belief, that it is true &s;o far as to en&s;ure permanency to in&s;titutions that are good; but not &s;o far as to di&s;courage us from attempting to reform tho&s;e that are bad. To con&s;ider it as true in an unlimited &s;en&s;e, would be to &s;erve the pur|po&s;es of de&s;poti&s;m; for which this, like a thou&s;and other maxims, has been invented and employed. It would teach us to &s;it down with a gloomy &s;atisfaction on the &s;tate of human affairs, to pronounce the race of man emphatically "fated to be cur&s;t," a com|munity of &s;elf-tormentors and mutual a&s;|&s;a&s;&s;ins, bound down by the irre&s;i&s;tible de&s;tiny of their nature to be robbed of their rea&s;on by prie&s;ts, and plundered of their property
<PB N="79" REF="024075_0082_0FC31800EB7A1C98">
by kings. It would teach us to join with Soame Jenyns, and furni&s;h new weapons to the oppre&s;&s;ors, by our manner of pitying the misfortunes of the oppre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>In confirmation of this adage, and as an apology for the exi&s;ting de&s;poti&s;ms, it is &s;aid, That all men are by nature tyrants, and will exerci&s;e their tyrannies, whenever they find opportunity. Allowing this a&s;&s;ertion to be true, it is &s;urely cited by the wrong party. It is an apology for equal, and not for un|equal governments; and the weapon belongs to tho&s;e who contend for the republican principle. If government be founded on the vices of mankind, its bu&s;ine&s;s is to re&s;train tho&s;e vices in all, rather than to fo&s;ter them in a few. The di&s;po&s;ition to tyrannize is effectually re&s;trained under the exerci&s;e of the equality of rights; while it is not only re|warded in the few, but invigorated in the ma|ny, under all other forms of the &s;ocial con|nexion. But it is almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to decide, among moral propen&s;ities, which of them belong to nature, and which are the offspring of habit; how many of our vices are charge|able on the permanent qualities of man, and how many re&s;ult from the mutable energies of &s;tate.</P>
<P>If it be in the power of a bad government to render men wor&s;e than nature has made them, why &s;hould we &s;ay it is not in the pow|er of a good one to render them better? and
<PB N="80" REF="024075_0083_0FC3180848B756A8">
if the latter be capable of producing this effect in any perceivable degree, where &s;hall we limit the progre&s;s of human wi&s;dom and the force of its in&s;titutions, in ameliorating not only the &s;ocial condition, but the controlling principles of man?</P>
<P>Among the component parts of govern|ment, that, who&s;e operation is direct on the moral habits of life, is the Admini&s;tration of Ju&s;tice. In this every per&s;on has a pecu|liar in&s;olated intere&s;t, which is almo&s;t detach|ed from the common &s;ympathies of &s;ociety. It is this which operates with a &s;ingular con|centrated energy, collecting the whole force of the &s;tate from the community at large, and bringing it to act upon a &s;ingle individual, affecting his life, reputation or property; &s;o that the governing power may &s;ay with pecu|liar propriety to the mini&s;ter of ju&s;tice, <HI>divide et impera</HI>; for, in ca&s;e of oppre&s;&s;ion, the victim's cries will be too feeble to excite op|po&s;ition; his cau&s;e having nothing in com|mon with that of the citizens at large. If therefore we would obtain an idea of the condition of men on any given portion of the earth, we mu&s;t pay a particular attention to their judiciary &s;y&s;tem, not in its form and theory, but in its &s;pirit and practi&s;e. It may be &s;aid in general of this part of the civil po|lity of a nation, that as it is a &s;tream flowing from the common fountain of the government, and mu&s;t be tinged with whatever impurities
<PB N="81" REF="024075_0084_0FC3180A3AEB2CF8">
are found in the &s;ource from whence it de|&s;cends, the only hope of clean&s;ing the &s;tream is by purifing the fountain.</P>
<P>If I were able to give an energetic &s;ketch of the office and dignity of a rational &s;y&s;tem of juri&s;prudence, de&s;cribe the full extent of its effects on the happine&s;s of men, and then exhibit the perver&s;ions and corruptions at|tendant on this bu&s;ine&s;s in mo&s;t of the go|vernments of Europe, it would furni&s;h one of the mo&s;t powerful arguments in favor of a general revolution, and afford no &s;mall con|&s;olation to tho&s;e per&s;ons who look forward with certainty to &s;uch an event. But my plan embraces too many &s;ubjects, to be par|ticular in any; all that I can promi&s;e my&s;elf is to &s;eize the rough features of &s;y&s;tems, and mark the moral attitudes of man as placed in the nece&s;&s;ary po&s;ture to &s;upport them.</P>
<P>It is generally under&s;tood that the object of government, in this part of its admini&s;tration, is merely to <HI>re&s;train</HI> the vices of men. But there is another object prior to this; an office more &s;acred, and equally indi&s;pen&s;able, is to <HI>prevent</HI> their vices&mdash;to correct them in their origin, or eradicate them totally from the adole&s;cent mind. The latter is performed by in&s;truction, the former by coercion; the one is the tender duty of a father, the other, the unrelenting drudgery of a ma&s;ter; but both are the bu&s;ine&s;s of government, and ought to
<PB N="82" REF="024075_0085_0FC31811E0620618">
be made concurrent branches of the &s;y&s;tem of juri&s;prudence.</P>
<P>The ab&s;urd and abominable doctrine, <HI>that private vices are public benefits,</HI> it is hoped, will be blotted from the memory of man, ex|punged from the catalogue of human follies, with the &s;y&s;tems of governments which gave it birth. The ground of this in&s;ulting doctrine is, that advantage may be taken of the extra|vagant foibles of individuals to increa&s;e the revenues of the &s;tate; as if the chief end of &s;ociety were, to &s;teal money for the govern|ment's pur&s;e! to be &s;quandered by the go|vernors, to render them more in&s;olent in their oppre&s;&s;ions! It is humiliating, to an|&s;wer &s;uch arguments as the&s;e; where we mu&s;t lay open the mo&s;t degrading retreats of pro|&s;tituted logic, to di&s;cover the po&s;itions on which they are founded. But <HI>Orders</HI> and <HI>Privileges</HI> will lead to any thing: once teach a man, that <HI>&s;ome are born to command and others to be commanded</HI>; and after that, there is no camel too big for him to &s;wallow.</P>
<P>This idea of the objects to be kept in view by the &s;y&s;tem of ju&s;tice, involving in it the bu&s;ine&s;s of prevention as well as of re&s;triction, leads us to &s;ome ob&s;ervations on the particu|lar &s;ubject of criminal juri&s;prudence. Every &s;ociety, con&s;idered in it&s;elf as a moral and phy&s;ical entity, has the undoubted faculty of &s;elf-pre&s;ervation. It is an independent be|ing; and, towards other beings in like cir|cum&s;tances
<PB N="83" REF="024075_0086_0FC31812D3FB0168">
of independence, it has a right to u&s;e this faculty of defending it&s;elf, without previous notice to the party; or without the ob&s;ervance of any duty, but that of ab&s;taining from offen&s;ive operations. But when it acts towards the members of its own family, to|wards tho&s;e dependent and defencele&s;s beings that make part of it&s;elf, the <HI>right</HI> of coercion is preceded by the <HI>duty</HI> of in&s;truction. It may be &s;afely pronounced, <HI>that a &s;tate has no right to puni&s;h a man, to whom it has gi|ven no previous in&s;truction;</HI> and con&s;equent|ly, any per&s;on has a right to do any action, unle&s;s he has been informed that it has an evil tendency. It is true, that as relative to par|ticular ca&s;es, the having given this informa|tion is a thing that the &s;ociety mu&s;t &s;ometimes <HI>pre&s;ume,</HI> and is not always obliged to <HI>prove.</HI> But the&s;e ca&s;es are rare, and ought never to form a general rule. This pre&s;umption has however pa&s;&s;ed into a general rule, and is adopted as univer&s;al practi&s;e. With what ju&s;tice or propriety it is &s;o adopted, a very little reflection will enable us to decide.</P>
<P>The great out-lines of morality are ex|tremely &s;imple and ea&s;y to be under&s;tood; they may be &s;aid to be written on the heart of a man antecedent to his a&s;&s;ociating with his fellow-creatures. As a &s;elf-dependent being he is &s;elf-in&s;tructed; and as long as he &s;hould remain a &s;imple child of <HI>nature,</HI> he would receive from nature all the le&s;&s;ons nece&s;&s;ary
<PB N="84" REF="024075_0087_0FC31814A1C55AF0">
to his condition. He would be a complete moral agent; and &s;hould he violate the rights of another independent man like him&s;elf, he would &s;in again&s;t &s;ufficient light, to merit any puni&s;hment that the offended party might inflict upon him. But <HI>&s;ociety</HI> opens upon us a new field of contemplation; it furni&s;hes man with an other cla&s;s of rights, and impo&s;es upon him an additional &s;y&s;tem of duties; it enlarges the &s;phere of his moral agency, and makes him a kind of artificial being, propel|ling and propelled by new dependencies, in which nature can no longer &s;erve him as a guide. Being removed from her rudimen|tal &s;chool, and entered in the college of &s;ocie|ty, he is called to encounter problems which the elementary tables of his heart will not al|ways enable him to &s;olve. Society then ought to be con&s;i&s;tent with her&s;elf in her own in&s;titutions; if &s;he &s;ketches the lines of his duty with a variable pencil, too &s;light for his natural perception, &s;he &s;hould lend him her optical gla&s;&s;es to di&s;cern them; if &s;he takes the ferule in one hand, &s;he is bound to u&s;e the fe&s;cue with the other.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t ob&s;erve farther&mdash;that though &s;o|ciety it&s;elf be a &s;tate of nature, as relative to the nation at large&mdash;though it be a &s;tate to which mankind naturally recur to &s;atisfy their wants and increa&s;e the &s;um of their happine&s;s &mdash;though all its laws and regulations may be perfectly rea&s;onable, and calculated to pro|mote
<PB N="85" REF="024075_0088_0FC31818D2F587E8">
the good of the whole&mdash;yet, with re|gard to an individual member, his having <HI>con&s;ented</HI> to the&s;e laws, or even cho&s;en to live in the &s;ociety, is but a <HI>fiction</HI>; and a rigid di&s;cipline founded on a fiction, is &s;urely hard upon its object. In general it may be &s;aid, that a man comes into &s;ociety by birth; he neither con&s;ents nor di&s;&s;ents re&s;pecting his relative condition; he fir&s;t opens his eyes on that &s;tate of human affairs in which the in|tere&s;ts of his moral a&s;&s;ociates are infinitely complicated; with the&s;e his duties are &s;o blended and intermingled, that nature can give him but little a&s;&s;i&s;tance in finding them out. His morality it&s;elf mu&s;t be arbitrary; it mu&s;t be varied at every moment, to com|prehend &s;ome local and po&s;itive regulation; his &s;cience is to begin where that of preced|ing ages has ended; his alpha is their omega; and he is called upon to act by in&s;tinct what they have but learnt to do from the experi|ence of all mankind. Natural rea&s;on may teach me not to &s;trike my neighbor without a cau&s;e; but it will never forbid my &s;ending a &s;ack of wool from England, or printing the French con&s;titution in Spain. The&s;e are po&s;itive prohibitions, which nature has not written in her book; &s;he has therefore never taught them to her children. The &s;ame may be &s;aid of all regulations that ari&s;e from the &s;ocial compact.</P>
<P><PB N="86" REF="024075_0089_0FC3182417B503F8">It is a truth, I believe, not to be called in que&s;tion, that every man is born with an im|pre&s;criptible claim to a portion of the ele|ments; which portion is termed his <HI>birth-right.</HI> Society may vary this right, as to its form, but never can de&s;troy it in &s;ub&s;tance. She has no controul over the man, till he is born; and the right being born with him, and being nece&s;&s;ary to his exi&s;tence, &s;he can no more annihilate the one than the other, though &s;he has the power of new-modeling both. But on coming into the world, he finds that the ground which nature had pro|mi&s;ed him is taken up, and in the occupancy of others; &s;ociety has changed the form of his birth-right; the general &s;tock of elements, from which the lives of men are to be &s;up|ported, has undergone a new modification; and his portion among the re&s;t. He is told that he cannot claim it in its pre&s;ent form&punc; as an independant inheritance: that he mu&s;t draw on the &s;tock of &s;ociety, in&s;tead of the &s;tock of nature; that he is bani&s;hed from the mother; and mu&s;t cleave to the nur&s;e. In this unexpected occurrence he is unprepared to act; but <HI>knowledge</HI> is a part of the &s;tock of &s;ociety; and an indi&s;pen&s;able part to be allot|ed in the portion of the claimant, is <HI>in&s;tructi|on</HI> relative to the new arrangement of natu|ral right. To withold this in&s;truction there|fore would be, not merely the omi&s;&s;ion of a duty, but the commi&s;&s;ion of a crime; and
<PB N="87" REF="024075_0090_0FC31825691BE148">
&s;ociety in this ca&s;e would &s;in again&s;t the man, before the man could &s;in again&s;t &s;ociety.</P>
<P>I &s;hould hope to meet the a&s;&s;ent of all un|prejudiced readers, in carrying this idea &s;till farther. In ca&s;es where a per&s;on is born of poor parents, or finds him&s;elf brought into the community of men without the means of &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence, &s;ociety is bound in duty to furni&s;h him the means. She ought not only to in|&s;truct him in the artificial laws by which pro|perty is &s;ecured, but in the artificial indu&s;try by which it is obtained. She is bound, in <HI>ju&s;tice</HI> as well as policy, to give him &s;ome art or trade. For the rea&s;on of his incapacity is, that <HI>&s;he</HI> has u&s;urped his birth-right; and this is re&s;toring it to him in another form, more convenient for both parties. The failure of &s;ociety in this branch of her duty, is the oc|ca&s;ion of much the greater part of the evils that call for criminal juri&s;prudence. The in|dividual feels that he is robbed of his natural right; he cannot bring his proce&s;s to reclaim it from the great community, by which he is overpowered; he therfore feels authorized in repri&s;al; in taking another's goods to replace his own. And it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that in numberle&s;s in&s;tances the conduct of &s;ociety ju&s;tifies him in this proceeding; &s;he has &s;eized upon his property, and commenced the war again&s;t him.</P>
<P>Some, who perceive the&s;e truths, &s;ay that it is un&s;afe for &s;ociety to publi&s;h them; but I
<PB N="88" REF="024075_0091_0FC31826613C4918">
&s;ay it is un&s;afe not to publi&s;h them. For the party from which the mi&s;chief is expected to ari&s;e, has the knowledge of them already, and has acted upon them in all ages. It is the wi&s;e who are ignorant of the&s;e things, and not the fooli&s;h. They are truths of nature; and in them the teachers of mankind are the only party that remains to be taught. It is a &s;ub|ject on which the logic of indigence is much clearer than that of opulence. The latter rea&s;ons from contrivance, the former from feeling; and God has not endowed us with fal&s;e feelings, in things that &s;o weightily con|cern our happine&s;s.</P>
<P>None can deny that the obligation is much &s;tronger on me, to &s;upport my life, than to &s;upport the claim that my neighbour has to his property. Nature commands the fir&s;t, &s;ociety the &s;econd:&mdash;in one I obey the laws of God, which are univer&s;al and eternal; in the other, the laws of man, which are local and temporary.</P>
<P>It has been the folly of all old governments, to begin every thing at the wrong end, and to erect their in&s;titutions on an inver&s;ion of prin|ciple. This is more &s;adly the ca&s;e in their &s;y&s;tems of juri&s;prudence, than is commonly imagined. <HI>Compelling</HI> ju&s;tice is always mi&s;ta|ken for <HI>rendering</HI> ju&s;tice. But this impor|tant branch of admini&s;tration con&s;i&s;ts not merely in compelling men to be ju&s;t to each other, and individuals to &s;ociety&mdash;this is not
<PB N="89" REF="024075_0092_0FC3182A453E8F50">
the whole, nor is the principal part, nor even the beginning, of the operation. The &s;ource of power is &s;aid to be the &s;ource of ju&s;tice; but it does not an&s;wer this de&s;cription, as long as it contents it&s;elf with <HI>compul&s;ion.</HI> Ju&s;tice mu&s;t begin by flowing from its &s;ource; and the fir&s;t as well as the mo&s;t important object is, to open its channels from &s;ociety to all the individual members. This part of the admi|ni&s;tration being well devi&s;ed and diligently executed, the other parts would le&s;&s;en away by degrees to matters of inferior con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>It is an undoubted truth, that our duty is in&s;eparably connected with our happine&s;s. And why &s;hould we de&s;pair of convincing every member of &s;ociety of a truth &s;o impor|tant for him to know? Should any per&s;on object, by &s;aying, that nothing like this has ever yet been done. I an&s;wer that nothing like this has ever yet been tried. Society has hitherto been cur&s;t with governments, who&s;e exi&s;tence depended on the extinction of proof. Every moral light has been &s;mothered under the bu&s;hel of perpetual impo&s;ition; from whence it emits but faint and glimmering rays, always in&s;ufficient to form any luminous &s;y&s;|tem on any of the civil concerns of men. But the&s;e covers are crumbling to the du&s;t, with the governments which they &s;upport; and the pro|bability becomes more apparent, the more it is con&s;idered, that &s;ociety is capable of curing all the evils to which it has given birth.</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="024075_0093_0FC3182E5470DD48">It &s;eems that men, to dimini&s;h the phy&s;ical evils that &s;urround them, connect them&s;elves in &s;ociety; and from this connexion their mo|ral evils ari&s;e. But the <HI>immediate</HI> occa&s;ion of the moral evils is nothing more than the <HI>re|mainder</HI> of the phy&s;ical that &s;till exi&s;t even under the regulations that &s;ociety makes to ba|ni&s;h them. The direct object therefore of the government ought to be, to de&s;troy as far as po&s;&s;ible the remaining quantity of phy&s;ical evils; and the moral would &s;o far follow their de&s;truction. But the mi&s;take that is always made on this &s;ubject is, that governments, in|&s;tead of laying the ax at the root of the tree, aim their &s;trokes at the branches; they attack the moral evils <HI>directly</HI> by vindictive ju&s;tice, in&s;tead of removing the phy&s;ical by di&s;tribu|tive ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>There are two di&s;tinct kinds of phy&s;ical evils; one ari&s;es from want, or the apprehen|&s;ion of want; the other from bodily di&s;ea&s;e. The former &s;eems capable of being removed by &s;ociety; the latter is inevitable. But the latter gives no occa&s;ion to moral di&s;orders; it being the common lot of all, we all bear our part in &s;ilence, without complaining of each other, or revenging our&s;elves on the commu|nity. As it is out of the power of our neigh|bour's goods to relieve us, we do not covet them for this purpo&s;e. The former is the only kind from which moral evils ari&s;e; and to this the energies of government ought to be
<PB N="91" REF="024075_0094_0FC3183886901978">
chiefly directed; e&s;pecially that part which is called the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>No nation is yet &s;o numerous, nor any country &s;o populous, as it is capable of be|coming. Europe, taken together, would &s;up|port at lea&s;t five times its pre&s;ent number, even on its pre&s;ent &s;y&s;tem of cultivation; and how many times this increa&s;ed popula|tion may be multiplied by new di&s;coveries in the infinite &s;cience of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, no man will pretend to calculate. This of it&s;elf is &s;uffici|ent to prove, that &s;ociety at pre&s;ent has the means of rendering all its members happy in every re&s;pect, except the removal of bodily di&s;ea&s;e. The common &s;tock of the commu|nity appears abundantly &s;ufficient for this pur|po&s;e. By common &s;tock, I would not be un|der&s;tood to mean the goods exclu&s;ively appro|priated to individuals. Exclu&s;ive property is not only con&s;i&s;tent with good order among men, but it &s;eems, and perhaps really is, nece&s;|&s;ary to the exi&s;tence of &s;ociety. But the com|mon &s;tock of which I &s;peak, con&s;i&s;ts, fir&s;t, in <HI>knowledge,</HI> or the improvements which men have made in the means of acquiring a &s;up|port; and &s;econdly, in the <HI>contributions</HI> which it is nece&s;&s;ary &s;hould be collected from indi|viduals, and applied to the maintenance of tranquility in the &s;tate. The property exclu|&s;ively belonging to individuals, can only be the &s;urplu&s;&s;age remaining in their hands, after deducting what is nece&s;&s;ary to the real wants

of &s;ociety. Society is the fir&s;t proprietor; as &s;he is the original cau&s;e of the appropriation of wealth, and its indi&s;pen&s;able guardian in the hands of the individual.</P>
<P>Society then is bound, in the fir&s;t place, to di&s;tribute knowledge to every per&s;on accord|ing to his wants, to enable him to be u&s;eful and happy; &s;o far as to di&s;po&s;e him to take an ac|tive intere&s;t in the welfare of the &s;tate. <HI>Se|condly,</HI> where the faculties of the individual are naturally defective, &s;o that he remains un|able to provide for him&s;elf, &s;he is bound &s;till to &s;upport and render him happy.

mode of puni&s;hment. It is no part of my &s;ubject to enter into this enquiry, any farther than &s;imply to ob&s;erve, that it is the character|i&s;tic of arbitrary governments to be jealous of their power. And, as jealou&s;y is, of all human pa&s;&s;ions, the mo&s;t vindictive and the lea&s;t rational, the&s;e governments &s;eek the revenge of injuries in the mo&s;t ab&s;urd and tremen|dous puni&s;hments that their fury can invent. As far as any rule can be di&s;covered in their gradation of puni&s;hments, it appears to be this, That the &s;everity of the penalty is in proportion to the inju&s;tice of the law.

di&s;cover, and would not be expen&s;ive in prac|tice. The government generally e&s;tabli&s;hes mini&s;ters of ju&s;tice in every part of the do|minion. The fir&s;t object of the&s;e mini&s;ters ought to be, to &s;ee that every per&s;on is well in&s;tructed in his duties and in his rights; that he is rendered perfectly acquainted with eve|ry law, in its true &s;pirit and tendency, in order that he may know the rea&s;on of his obedience, and the manner of obtaining redre&s;s, in ca&s;e he &s;hould deem it unju&s;t; that he is taught to feel the cares and intere&s;ts of an active ci|tizen, to con&s;ider him&s;elf as a real member of the &s;tate, know that the government is his own, that the &s;ociety is his friend, and that the officers of the &s;tate are the &s;ervants of the people. A per&s;on po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the&s;e ideas will never violate the law, unle&s;s it be from ne|ce&s;&s;ity; and &s;uch nece&s;&s;ity is to be prevented by means which are equally obvious.</P>
<P>For the purpo&s;es of compul&s;ive ju&s;tice, it is not enough that the laws be rendered famili|ar to the people; but the tribunals ought to be near at hand, ea&s;y of acce&s;s, and equally open to the poor as to the rich; the means of coming at ju&s;tice &s;hould be cheap, expedi|tious and certain; the mode of proce&s;s &s;hould be &s;imple and perfectly intelligible to the meane&s;t capacity, unclouded with my&s;teries and unperplexed with forms.

<P>After con&s;idering what is the duty of &s;oci|ety, and what <HI>would be</HI> the practice of a well-organized government, relative to the &s;ubject of this chapter, it is almo&s;t u&s;ele&s;s to enquire, what <HI>is</HI> the practice of all the old governments of Europe. We may be &s;ure beforehand, that it is directly the contrary,&mdash;that, like all other parts of the &s;y&s;tem, it is the inver&s;ion of every thing that is right and rea&s;onable. The pyramid is every where &s;et on the little end, and all &s;orts of extraneous rubbi&s;h are con|&s;tantly brought to prop it up.</P>
<P>Unequal governments are nece&s;&s;arily found|ed in ignorance, and they mu&s;t be &s;upported by ignorance; to deviate from their prin|ciple, would be voluntary &s;uicide. The fir&s;t great object of their policy is to perpetuate that undi&s;turbed ignorance of the people which is the companion of poverty, the pa|rent of crimes, and the pillar of the &s;tate.</P>
<P>In England the people at large are as per|fectly ignorant of the acts of parliament af|ter they are made, as they po&s;&s;ibly can be before. They are printed by one man only, who is called the king's printer&mdash;in the old German character, which few men can read &mdash;and &s;old at a price that few can afford to pay. But le&s;t &s;ome &s;craps of comments upon them &s;hould come to the people through the medium of the public new&s;papers, every &s;uch paper is &s;tamped with a heavy duty; and

<P>As to the general &s;y&s;tem of the laws of the land, on which all property depends, no man in the kingdom knows them, and no man pretends to know them.

<Q><L>"To pour in light on Pluto's drear abodes,</L>
<L>Abhorr'd by men, and dreadful e'en to gods."</L></Q>
What are we to do with our &s;en&s;ibility, with our hone&s;t in&s;tinct of propriety&mdash;how refrain from exclamations of horror, while we con|template a &s;et of men a&s;&s;uming the &s;acred garb of ju&s;tice, for the uniform and well-known purpo&s;e of &s;elling their deci&s;ions to the high|e&s;t bidder! For a judge to receive a bribe, we &s;hould think an indelible &s;tain upon his character as a <HI>man</HI>; but what &s;hall we &s;ay of the &s;tate of human nature, where it is no di&s;grace to him as a <HI>judge?</HI> Where it is not only expected as a matter of cour&s;e, and practi&s;ed without di&s;gui&s;e, but is made almo&s;t a nece&s;&s;ary part of the judiciary &s;y&s;tem?</P>
<P>Whether the practice of receiving bribes was the original idea on which is founded the <HI>venality of offices</HI> in modern governments, it is not to our purpo&s;e to enquire. But cer|tain it is, they are concomitant ideas, and co|exten&s;ive practices; and it is de&s;igned that
<PB N="98" REF="024075_0101_0FC31856690F42D0">
they &s;hould be &s;o. In France, before the revolution, the office of judge was not in|deed hereditary, like that of king; but it was wor&s;e; it was held up for &s;ale by the king, and put at auction by the mini&s;ter. As a part of the king's revenue aro&s;e from the &s;ale of ju&s;tice, the government &s;old all the offices in that department at fixed prices; but the mini&s;ter made the bargains with tho&s;e who would give him mo&s;t. Thus the &s;eats of the judges became objects of &s;peculation, open to all the world; and the man who&s;e con&s;cience was the be&s;t fitted to make a pro|fitable trade of deciding cau&s;es, could afford to give the highe&s;t price, and was con&s;equent|ly &s;ure to be judge.</P>
<P>Ju&s;tice then was a commodity which nece&s;|&s;arily gave a profit to three &s;ets of men, before it could be purcha&s;ed by the &s;uitor; even &s;uppo&s;ing it might have flowed to him in a di|rect channel. But this was a thing impo&s;&s;ible: there were other de&s;criptions of men, more numerous, if not more greedy, than tho&s;e of whom we have &s;poken, through who&s;e hands it mu&s;t pa&s;s and repa&s;s, before it could arrive at the client, who had paid his money to the judge. The&s;e men who infe&s;ted the tribunals in all &s;tages of the bu&s;ine&s;s, were divided in France into about &s;ix cla&s;&s;es. for want of the preci&s;e names in Engli&s;h to de&s;ignate all their official de&s;tinctions, we &s;hall rank the whole

under the great appellation of Lawyers<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">To avoid any &s;u&s;picion of exaggeration, I will mention by their original names &s;uch of the&s;e cla&s;&s;es as occur to me.

<P>Lawyers in France &s;erved two important purpo&s;es, which it is &s;uppo&s;ed they do not &s;erve in England: they added con&s;iderably to the revenues of the crown by the purcha&s;e of their places; and they covered the iniquity of the judges under the impenetrable veil of their own. In a cau&s;e of ordinary con&s;equence, there was more writing to be done in France than there is even in England, perhaps by a hundred and fifty pages. The rea&s;on of this was, that it was more nece&s;&s;ary to involve the que&s;tion in my&s;teries and perplexities that &s;hould be ab&s;olutely in&s;crutable. For it mu&s;t never be known, either at the time of trial or ever after, on what point or principle the cau&s;e was decided. To an&s;wer this end, the mul|tiplying of the different orders of the mana|gers,
<PB N="100" REF="024075_0103_0FC3185C626684C0">
as well as encrea&s;ing the quantity of wri|ting, had an admirable effect; it removed the po&s;&s;ibility of fixing a charge of fraud or mi&s;|management on any one of the great fraterni|ty, or of di&s;covering, among the formidable piles of papers and parchments that enve|loped the my&s;teries of the trial, in what &s;tage the iniquity was introduced.</P>
<P>To call this whole &s;y&s;tem of operations a &s;olemn farce, is to give no utterance to our feelings; to &s;ay it is a &s;plendid mockery of ju&s;tice by which individuals are robbed of their property, is almo&s;t to &s;peak its prai&s;e.&mdash; The reflecting mind cannot re&s;t upon it a mo|ment, without glancing over &s;ociety, and be|wailing the terrible inroads made upon mo|rals public and private, the deva&s;tation of principle, the outrage upon nature, the de|gradation of the la&s;t particle of dignity by which we recognize our own re&s;emblance in man.</P>
<P>Its obvious tendency is, by its enormous expence, to bar the door of ju&s;tice again&s;t the poor, who in &s;uch countries are &s;ure to form the great body of mankind,&mdash;to render them enemies to &s;ociety, by teaching that &s;ociety is an enemy to them,&mdash;to &s;timulate them to crimes both from their own nece&s;&s;ities, and from the example of their ma&s;ters,&mdash;and to &s;pread over the people at large an incru&s;ta|tion of ignorance, which excluding all ideas of

their duties and their rights, compels them to forget their relation to the human race.</P>
<P>Are the&s;e to be ranked among the circum|&s;tances, which call for a change in the govern|ments of Europe? Or are we to join with Mr. Burke, and lament as an evil of the French revolution, That the ancient &s;y&s;tem "of juri&s;prudence will no more be &s;tudied?" The whining of that good gentleman on this idea, is about as rational, as it would be to la|ment that the noble &s;cience of Heraldry was in danger of being forgotten; or that men had lo&s;t the my&s;tical meaning of <HI>Abracadabra.</HI> This word, &s;erving as a charm, an&s;wered the &s;ame purpo&s;e in Medecine, as heraldry does in honor; or the old juri&s;prudence, in ju&s;tice: it rendered men &s;uper&s;titious; and con&s;e|quently, immoral and unhappy.</P>
<P>It is &s;o fa&s;hionable in Europe, e&s;pecially among Engli&s;hmen, to &s;peak in prai&s;e of the Engli&s;h juri&s;prudence, and to con&s;ider it as a model of perfection, that it may &s;eem nece&s;|&s;ary for a per&s;on to begin with an apology for offering his ideas on that &s;ubject, if he means to deviate from the opinion &s;o generally e&s;ta|bli&s;hed. But in&s;tead of doing this, I will begin by apologizing for tho&s;e who at this day &s;upport the e&s;tabli&s;hed opinion: Your fair|e&s;t apology, Gentlemen, is, that you under|&s;tand nothing of the matter.

A commi&s;&s;ion of <HI>rebellion</HI> is an order i&s;&s;ued, af|ter the officer with the capias has &s;earched and cannot find the man, and after an outlawry has taken place. It is directed to other per&s;ons, requiring them to take up the man who was guilty of rebellion in refu&s;ing to write his name. But as the officer with the capias, be|fore outlawry, could not find the man, the i&s;|&s;uing the commi&s;&s;ion of rebellion <HI>now,</HI> has no other meaning but <HI>&s;ees.</HI> A <HI>&s;eque&s;tration</HI> is ta|king the whole property of the defendant into the hands of the court. And when this is done the cau&s;e is &s;oon done al&s;o; for no e&s;tate could la&s;t long there. When the mo|ney is gone, the proceedings cea&s;e.</P>
<P>But let us &s;uppo&s;e that the defendant has complied with all orders thus far, and has
<PB N="107" REF="024075_0110_0FC3187B21B39040">
put in a good and &s;ufficient an&s;wer. Let us leave out of our account all motions, peti|tions, decrees, orders, &amp;c. for amending the bill, for referring to Ma&s;ters the in&s;ufficiency of an&s;wers, reports upon tho&s;e an&s;wers, and farther an&s;wers, and exceptions to Ma&s;ters' reports, and orders and deci&s;ions relative to them; and, in&s;tead of enquiring into the ex|pence of the&s;e, let us go back and a&s;k what is the u&s;e of all, or of any part of this proce&s;s? Thirty thou&s;and Lawyers (this is &s;aid to be the number in the kingdom) are now living on ju&s;t &s;uch &s;tuff as the proce&s;s here de&s;cribed; and I call on them all, to point out the pur|po&s;e that any of it ever &s;erved, or even can &s;erve, to their clients.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be remembered, that all the pro|ceedings thus far, were to end in three pretended objects&mdash;to compel an ap|pearance; to obtain the <HI>u&s;ual</HI> and <HI>legal</HI> time for the defendant to prepare his an|&s;wer, and to compel him to give his an&s;wer. For the <HI>appearance,</HI> which is the &s;olemn appel|lation given to the action of writing a name, it would be an in&s;ult to the under&s;tanding of a child, to tell him that this could be of any &s;er|vice towards forwarding ju&s;tice. Next comes the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of applications and orders, for time to an&s;wer the bill. The practice of the court, which is the law in this ca&s;e, allows the defendant, fir&s;t a &s;hort term, and then the de|lay of four weeks, three weeks, and two weeks;
<PB N="108" REF="024075_0111_0FC31881F90C9958">
which in all reckonings, unle&s;s it be in law, make nine weeks. And if that be a rea&s;ona|ble time, when divided into three parts, why is it not &s;o before it is divided? And if neither the party, nor the court nor any body el&s;e, has a right to refu&s;e that term of time, why might not the defendant take it, without the expence of a&s;king three times? The remain|der of the proce&s;s goes to compel the defend|ant to give in an an&s;wer to the bill. And what is the importance of an an&s;wer? To &s;olve this que&s;tion, let us con&s;ider the object of the bill, to which the an&s;wer is required.</P>
<P>The bill expre&s;&s;es the claim of the plaintiff, and points out the nature of the decree, which he prays may be made in his favor again&s;t the defendant. Notice is given to the defendant, that &s;uch a &s;uit is pending, and that he may appear and &s;how cau&s;e why the decree &s;hould not be made. Having given this notice, it is not only cruel, but ab&s;urd, to think of forcing him to defend him&s;elf, whether he will or no. One would &s;uppo&s;e it little to the purpo&s;e, to make the attempt. Why may not the &s;ubpoe|na, which gives notice to the defendant, point out the day, beyond which he cannot give an an&s;wer? then if he choo&s;es to defend, hear him candidly; but if he refu&s;es to come, and does not choo&s;e to defend,&mdash;proceed in the cau&s;e; he is willing that the decree &s;hould pa&s;s. Can it be rea&s;onable,&mdash;can it be any thing &s;hort of flat contradiction and non&s;en&s;e,
<PB N="109" REF="024075_0112_0FC31883E6F75780">
to compel him to appear, to compel him to a&s;k for a delay, and to compel him to defend? Can his defence be nece&s;&s;ary in doing ju&s;tice to the plaintiff? And if he will not defend him&s;elf can you make him? Can any one of the whole ho&s;t of all the profe&s;&s;ions of the law, &s;how the lea&s;t &s;hadow of u&s;e in all this &s;lou|ri&s;h of proce&s;s thus far but <HI>fees</HI> on the one hand, and <HI>oppre&s;&s;ion</HI> on the other?</P>
<P>To proceed through all the forms, to the end of a &s;uit in Chancery, would be to write a commentary on many volumes of practice, and would be calling the patience of the reader to a trial from which it would certainly &s;hrink. But there are parts as much wor&s;e than what we have de&s;cribed, as this is wor&s;e than com|mon &s;en&s;e. Strip from the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice the forms that are perfectly u&s;ele&s;s and oppre&s;&s;ive, and coun&s;ellors will have much le&s;s to do; while the whole order of attornies and &s;ollicitors will fail to the ground. If the my&s;|teries of non&s;en&s;e were out of the way, a coun|&s;ellor who was called upon to hazard his repu|tation on the manner of conducting his client's cau&s;e, would no more have it prepared and brought forward by an attorney, than a man of bu&s;ine&s;s would hazard his fortune by doing that bu&s;ine&s;s through an ignorant agent which he could more ea&s;ily do him&s;elf. The quan|tity, of writing, really nece&s;&s;ary, in a &s;imple and dignified &s;y&s;tem of practice, is &s;o &s;mall, as
<PB N="110" REF="024075_0113_0FC31887EC666CB0">
to be perhaps incredible to tho&s;e who are ac|quainted only with the Engli&s;h proce&s;s.</P>
<P>I have &s;een the mode of conducting this bu&s;ine&s;s in a country, where the common law of England is the general rule of deci&s;ion, and where the adjudications of We&s;tmin&s;ter-hall are authorities, as much as they are in Great Britain. But the laws of that country have &s;tripped legal proce&s;s of its principal fol|lies; and the con&s;equence is, that the whole profe&s;&s;ion of attornies and &s;ollicitors has va|ni&s;hed. The coun&s;ellor does the whole bu&s;i|ne&s;s of his client; and &s;o &s;imple is the opera|tion, that a man may with ea&s;e commence, and carry through every &s;tage, to final judgment and execution, five hundred cau&s;es in a year.</P>
<P>And the whole proceedings in all the&s;e &s;hall not afford writing enough to employ a &s;ingle clerk one hour in twenty-four. The pro|ceedings and judgements in five hundred cau&s;es, in this country, would fill a warehou&s;e. And yet in that country, every allegation is nece&s;&s;ary in their declaration and pleadings, which is nece&s;&s;ary in We&s;tmin&s;ter-hall. As they are not paid by the line, their declarations have but one Count, and in that Count there is no tautology. And &s;o little is the expence of &s;uits, where no more is done than is nece&s;|&s;ary for ju&s;tice; that judgement, in a cau&s;e where there is no defence, may be obtained

for le&s;s than ten &s;hillings; and every per&s;on employed be fully paid for his &s;ervice<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">As this may awaken the curio&s;ity of &s;ome of my readers, I will give the details. Suppo&s;e a &s;uit to recover money due on Note or Bond; The writ and declaration are incorporated in one in&s;trument; that is, the declaration is contained in the writ. The &s;heriff is ordered to read this to the defendant, or leave a copy at his dwelling, at lea&s;t twelve days previous to the &s;itting of the court. This writ is u&s;ually filled up in a well known form, in a printed blank; of which a man may with ea&s;e fill a hundred in a day. For this the court taxes one &s;hil|ling and &s;ix-pence&punc; the &s;heriff if he has no travel to the defen|dant, is paid &s;ix-pence for reading the writ to him, and deliver|ing it to the clerk of the court. It is then the duty of the plain|tiff, or of his lawyer, (who is both coun&s;ellor and &s;olicitor) to attend the court on the fir&s;t day of the &s;itting; and then the parties in all cau&s;es are called by the cryer. For this attendance the court will tax three &s;hillings and four-pence halfpenny; and if the defendant intends to make no defence he will not an&s;wer when called; and the clerk thereupon, on the third day after calling, if no motion is made by the defendant, enters judg|ment for the plaintiff; for which he has about two &s;hillings; one &s;hilling more is paid for a writ of execution, which is in form and effect a <HI>fieri facias</HI> a <HI>capias ad &s;atisfaciendum,</HI> and an <HI>elegit</HI>: that is, it goes again&s;t the goods and chattels of the debtor; and if the &s;heriff cannot find tho&s;e, he is to take the body, or the land. Added to the&s;e co&s;ts, there is a duty of 1s. 6d to government. The&s;e &s;everal charges are an ample reward for all &s;ervices ren|dered.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Men who are habituated to the expences in|curred in law-&s;uits in England, will &s;carcely be per&s;uaded of the extent to which a reform would be carried, on a general de&s;truction of abu&s;es. But let them reflect, that when law proceedings are &s;tripped of every thing, but what the nature of the &s;ubject requires, there is no my&s;tery left. The rational part that re|mains is &s;oon comprehended, and ea&s;ily re|tained in memory. This would doubtle&s;s aug|ment
<PB N="112" REF="024075_0115_0FC3188F7AABE1D8">
the number of &s;uits; for it would open the courts to va&s;t multitudes of people, again&s;t whom they are now effectually &s;hut. But in proportion as it increa&s;ed the number of law-&s;uits, it would dimini&s;h the quantity of <HI>law-bu|&s;ine&s;s</HI>; and the number of lawyers would dwindle to one tenth of what it is at pre&s;ent. in the country above alluded to, the number of men &s;upported by this profe&s;&s;ion is to the whole population, as one to 4600. Reduce the lawyers here to that proportion, and there would be left about three thou&s;and in the kingdom. It is a&s;&s;erted, (I know not on what ground) that the pre&s;ent number is thirty thou|&s;and. Allowing it to be true, an army of twenty-&s;even thou&s;and lawyers, on this reform would find &s;ome other employment. But whether the reduction would amount to the number here &s;uppo&s;ed, or to half of it, is a que&s;tion of little moment. Saving the ex|pence of maintaining twenty or thirty thou|&s;and men in a u&s;ele&s;s occupation, and &s;ending them to profitable bu&s;ine&s;s, however impor|tant the object may appear, bears no propor|tion to the advantage of opening the door of ju&s;tice to the people, and habituating them to an ea&s;y and well-known method of demanding their right.</P>
<P>There is a &s;trange idea prevalent in Eng|land, (it has had its day in America) that it is good policy to rai&s;e the expences of legal proceedings above the reach of the lower cla&s;|&s;es
<PB N="113" REF="024075_0116_0FC31895DB69CAB0">
of people; as it le&s;&s;ens the number of &s;uits. This kind of rea&s;oning appears too ab&s;urd to &s;upport its own weight for a mo|ment; and it would be beneath our &s;erious notice, were it not for the reflection, that men of &s;uperficial re&s;earch are perpetually caught by it. the human mind is fitted, from its own indolence, to be dazzled by the glare of a propo&s;ition; and to receive and utter for truth, what it never gives it&s;elf the trouble to examine. There is no paradox among all the enormities of de&s;poti&s;m, but what finds its advocates from this very circum&s;tance. We mu&s;t not therefore &s;corn to encounter an argument becau&s;e it is fooli&s;h. The bu|&s;ine&s;s of &s;ober philo&s;ophy is often a ta&s;k of drudgery; it mu&s;t &s;ometimes li&s;ten to the mo&s;t incoherent clamours, which would be unworthy of its attention, did they not form a part of the general din, by which mankind are deafened and mi&s;led.</P>
<P>For a man to bring into court a &s;uit that is manife&s;tly unju&s;t, is a crime again&s;t the &s;tate; to hinder him from bringing one that is ju&s;t, is a crime of the &s;tate again&s;t him. It is a poor compliment to the wi&s;dom of a na|tion, to &s;uppo&s;e that no method can be devi&s;|ed for preventing the fir&s;t of the&s;e evils, with|out running into the la&s;t; and the la&s;t is ten times the greate&s;t of the two. The French, who appear to have been de&s;tined to give le&s;&s;ons to the world by the wi&s;dom of their
<PB N="114" REF="024075_0117_0FC31897A53CE1F8">
new in&s;titutions, as well as by the folly of their old, have found the &s;ecret of impo&s;ing a &s;mall fine on a vexatious plaintiff; and of e&s;tabli&s;hing many other regulations on this &s;ubject, which effectually &s;hut the door of the tribunal again&s;t the oppre&s;&s;or, while it ea&s;ily opens to the feeble&s;t cry of the oppre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>They have likewi&s;e e&s;tabli&s;hed a method of communicating the knowledge of the laws to every human creature in the kingdom, however ignorant he may be in other re&s;pects. They are printed and pa&s;ted up on public buildings in every town and village, and read and explained by the curate from the pulpit in every pari&s;h. It is in contemplation like|wi&s;e to in&s;titute a general &s;y&s;tem of public in|&s;truction, on a more u&s;eful and exten&s;ive plan than has ever yet been devi&s;ed. Several en|lightened philo&s;ophers are bu&s;ied in the&s;e re|&s;earches; and &s;everal &s;ocieties are formed, who&s;e object is to di&s;cover and bring for|ward the be&s;t concerted plan for this impor|tant purpo&s;e. In their whole &s;y&s;tem of di&s;tri|buting <HI>knowledge</HI> and <HI>ju&s;tice,</HI> they &s;eem to be aiming at a degree of perfection which pro|mi&s;es great &s;ucce&s;s. With all my partiality for the in&s;titutions of the United States, I &s;hould quote them (in compari&s;on to tho&s;e of France) with le&s;s confidence on the &s;ubject of this chapter, than of any other.</P>
<P>In the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice, the Ame|ricans are too much attached to the Engli&s;h
<PB N="115" REF="024075_0118_0FC3189E75AC20A8">
forms; which &s;erve to increa&s;e the expence and to my&s;tici&s;e the bu&s;ine&s;s, to a degree that is manife&s;tly inco&s;i&s;tent with the dignity of a true republic. But in re&s;pect to Public In&s;truction, there are &s;ome circum&s;tances which de&s;erve to be mentioned to their prai&s;e. I am going to &s;peak only of the particular &s;tate with which I am be&s;t ac|quainted. How many of the others are bet|ter regulated in this re&s;pect, and how many are wor&s;e, I am not accurately informed. This &s;tate (which contains le&s;s than 240,000 inhabitants) is divided into about one hun|dred towns. The&s;e are &s;ub-divided into &s;mall portions, called &s;chool-di&s;tricts, &s;uitable for the &s;upport of &s;mall &s;chools. Each of the&s;e di&s;tricts has a drawback on the &s;tate-trea&s;ury for a &s;um, which bears a proportion to the public taxes paid by the inhabitants of the di&s;trict, and which is about half equal to the &s;upport of a &s;chool-ma&s;ter. But this &s;um can be drawn only on condition, that a &s;chool is maintained in the di&s;trict.</P>
<P>The following remarkable con&s;equences &s;eem to have re&s;ulted from this provi&s;ion: There is not perhaps in that &s;tate, a per&s;on of &s;ix years old and of common intellects, who cannot read; and very few who cannot write and ca&s;t accounts!&mdash;Be&s;ides the u&s;eful books that are found in every family, it is computed that there are in the &s;tate about three hundred public libraries, which have been formed by
<PB N="116" REF="024075_0119_0FC318A0376E2F80">
voluntary &s;ub&s;cription among the people of the di&s;tricts and the pari&s;hes; till about the year 1768, which was more than one hun|dred and thirty years after the &s;ettlement of the &s;tate, no capital puni&s;hment, as I am in|formed, had been inflicted within its juri&s;|diction, nor any per&s;on convicted of a capital offence; &s;ince that period, very few have been convicted, and tho&s;e few are generally Europeans by birth and education; there is no extreme poverty in the &s;tate, and no ex|traordinary wealth accumulated by indi|viduals.</P>
<P>It would be ab&s;urd to &s;uppo&s;e, that Pub|lic In&s;truction is by any means carried to the perfection that it ought to be, in this or any other &s;tate in the univer&s;e. But this expe|riment proves, that good morals and equal liberty are reciprocal cau&s;es and effects; and that they are both the parents of national happine&s;s, and of great pro&s;perity.</P>
<P>All governments that lay any claim to re|&s;pectability or ju&s;tice have pro&s;cribed the idea of <HI>ex-po&s;t-&s;acto laws,</HI> or laws made after the performance of an action, con&s;tituting that action a crime, and puni&s;hing the party for a thing that was innocent at the time of its be|ing done. Such laws would be &s;o flagrant a violation of natural right, that in the French and &s;everal of the American State Con&s;tituti|ons, they are &s;olemnly interdicted in their Declarations of Rights. This pro&s;cription is
<PB N="117" REF="024075_0120_0FC318A69088AE68">
likewi&s;e con&s;idered as a fundamental article of Engli&s;h liberty, and almo&s;t the only one that has not been habitually violated, within the pre&s;ent century. But let us re&s;ort to rea|&s;on and ju&s;tice, and a&s;k what is the difference between a violation of this article, and the ob|&s;ervance of that tremendous maxim of juri&s;|prudence, common to all the nations above|mentioned, <HI>ignorantia legis neminem excu&s;at?</HI></P>
<P>Mo&s;t of the laws of &s;ociety are po&s;itive re|gulations, not taught by nature. Indeed, &s;uch only are applicable to the &s;ubject now in que&s;tion. For <HI>ignorantia legis</HI> can have reference only to laws ari&s;ing out of &s;ociety, in which our natural feelings have no con|cern; and where a man is ignorant of &s;uch a law, he is in the &s;ame &s;ituation as if the law did not exi&s;t. To read it to him from the tribunal, where he &s;tands arraigned for the breach of it, is to him preci&s;ely the &s;ame thing as it would be to originate it at the &s;ame time by the &s;ame tribunal, for the expre&s;s purpo&s;e of his condemnation. The law till then, as relative to him, is not in being. He is therefore in the &s;ame predicament that the &s;ociety in general would be, under the ope|ration of an <HI>ex-po&s;t-facto</HI> law. Hence we ought to conclude that, as it &s;eems difficult for a government to di&s;pen&s;e with the maxim above-mentioned, a free people ought, in their declaration of rights, to provide for uni|ver&s;al public in&s;truction. If they neglect to
<PB N="118" REF="024075_0121_0FC318AB8AA92810">
do this, and mean to avoid the ab&s;urdity of a &s;elf-de&s;troying policy, by adhering to a &s;y&s;tem of ju&s;tice which would pre&s;erve a dig|nity and in&s;pire a confidence worthy the name of liberty, they ought to reject the maxim altogether; and in&s;ert in their declaration of rights, that in&s;truction alone can con&s;titute a duty; and that laws can enforce no obedi|ence, but where they are explained.</P>
<P>It is truly hard and &s;ufficiently to be re|greted, that any part of &s;ociety &s;hould be obliged to yield obedience to the laws to which they have not literally and per&s;onally con&s;ented. Such is the &s;tate of things; it is nece&s;&s;ary that a majority &s;hould govern. If it be an evil to obey a law to which we have not con&s;ented, it is at lea&s;t a nece&s;&s;ary evil; but to compel a compliance with orders which are unknown, is carrying inju&s;tice beyond the bounds of nece&s;&s;ity; it is ab&s;urd, and even impo&s;&s;ible. Laws in this ca&s;e may be avenged, but cannot be obeyed; they may in&s;pire terror, but can never command re|&s;pect.</P>
