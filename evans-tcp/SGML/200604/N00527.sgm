<HEAD>A Blessed Medicine for Sinful Madness.</HEAD>
<HEAD>A Discourse, Occasioned by a Sentence of DEATH, passed upon several Malefactors, who were then in the Congregation.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>Ecclesiastes IX,</BIBL>
<Q><HI>Madness is in their Hearts, while they Live, and after that they go to the Dead.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IT is a very doleful Thing, that up|on the Reading of this Text, I may do as our Saviour, upon a better Occasion did; even shut the Book, and <HI>Begin</HI> to say, <HI>This day is this Scripture fulfiled in your Eyes.</HI> The <HI>Beginning</HI> of it ha's been wofully ful|filled by the <HI>Mad Lives</HI> of some un|happy and condemned <HI>Malefactors,</HI> who make a <HI>Sight</HI> in this house at this Time, very moving unto all Spectators. The Endeavour of one Sermon more is to be bestow'd upon them before

they <HI>Dy,</HI> that their <HI>Madness</HI> many not accompany them unto their Execution, to be cured only by <HI>Death,</HI> which is indeed an <HI>Effectual,</HI> but a very misera|ble <HI>Cure for all Diseases.</HI></P>
<P>We have in our Text, A <HI>Wise</HI> man, describing of a <HI>Mad</HI> man. Tis an Im|penitent and an unreclameable Sinner, which hath here the Title of a <HI>Mad man</HI> too justly put upon him; and the <HI>Madness</HI> of such a man hath both the <HI>Cause</HI> of in and the <HI>End</HI> of it, here Assigned.</P>
<P>First, For the <HI>Cause</HI> of this <HI>Madness.</HI> A great thing that inspires wicked men with so much <HI>Madness</HI> is, their Obser|ving, <HI>That there is one Event unto all.</HI> Many a man is too <HI>Pore-blind</HI> to see a|ny Difference between <HI>Good</HI> and <HI>Bad</HI> men in the World. As to the <HI>Comforts</HI> of this Life, he sees an <HI>Ishmael</HI> to live as long as an <HI>Isaac,</HI> an <HI>Epicure</HI> to fare as well as an <HI>Abraham.</HI> As to the <HI>Trou|bles</HI> of this Life, he sees a <HI>Job,</HI> a <HI>David,</HI> a <HI>Lazarus</HI> in as terrible Distresses, as any that befall the worst of men, and <HI>Saul</HI> and <HI>Jonathan</HI> in <HI>their Deaths not Divided.</HI> What follows now? <HI>Madnes<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> is in their hearts while they live.</HI> Tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">

passage, <HI>While they live,</HI> notes the con|tinuance, and Obstinacy of the Malady. And for an Instance, this <HI>Madness</HI> Expresses it self particularly, in that one <HI>Mad</HI> Imagination, <HI>That the basest Life here, is better than the best hereafter;</HI> or as the Proverb in our Context has it, <HI>A Living Dog is better than a dead Lyon.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, For the <HI>End</HI> of this <HI>Mad|ness.</HI> Tis here concluded in that clause, <HI>After that, they go to the Dead.</HI> A clause capable of a Various Interpretation. Some carry it, as a further Account of the <HI>Promiscuous Events</HI> happening both to <HI>Good</HI> and <HI>Bad</HI> men. They both <HI>Go to the Dead.</HI> But we may rather con|ceive the <HI>Issue</HI> of the <HI>Madness</HI> that is in wicked men, here pointed at. It Ex|pires in <HI>Death;</HI> of which <HI>Death</HI> we must understand, That it is Agreeable to the <HI>Life</HI> which went before; and therefore a Wretched, Woful, Shameful <HI>Death,</HI> a <HI>Death</HI> in <HI>Madness,</HI> and there|fore a <HI>Death</HI> in <HI>Misery,</HI> must be imply'd in this Assertion.

<P><PB REF="000655_0005_0FA9A45DED407CE8">
We have Two very Sorrowful Sub|jects to discourse upon; and therefore my whole Sermon must be like <HI>Eze|kiels</HI> Roll, full of <HI>Lamentation and Mourning and Wo.</HI></P>
<P>The first PROPOSITION which do's Arrest our Thoughts, is this,</P>
<P><HI>It is a Mad Life, that Ungodly men use to Lead.</HI></P>
<P>There is an Horrible <HI>Madness</HI> which do's possess the <HI>Hearts,</HI> and thereupon pollute the <HI>Lives</HI> of all ungodly men. Every Penitent in this Assembly, will in much Bitterness of Soul, confess the Truth of this <HI>Proposition,</HI> and say, <HI>None but Mad men would ever do as we have done!</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Word</HI> of God calls every thing by its <HI>Right Name;</HI> and Ungodly men are called <HI>Mad men</HI> in those unerring Oracles. As the Preacher tells us, in Ecc. 2. 2. <HI>I said of Laughter, it is mad;</HI> So do's the Bible assure us concerning the Merry Jolly Sinner, <HI>He is Mad, &amp; there is a Madness in all his wayes.</HI> It assuresus concerning all that Renounce and Forsake the Blessed God, in Jere. 30. 38. <HI>They are mad upon their Idels.</HI> Our First Father by his Fall, gave him|self
<PB N="5" REF="000655_0006_0FA9A45F59218478">
a sore blow in his Head; he Crack'd and Craz'd his own <HI>Brain;</HI> and the <HI>Madness</HI> hath ever since run in a Blood; his poor Children derive it from him. Hence tis the Name of a Sinner, in Psal 14. 1. <HI>He is a Fool!</HI> and <HI>Solomon</HI> who Preach't and Wrote with some Imitation of his Father, do's es|pouse that <HI>Phrase,</HI> as the most proper to denote, A <HI>Sinner,</HI> by. Now it speci|fies but a Degree of the same Distem|per; the <HI>Dotage</HI> of a Sinner quickly grows up into <HI>Phrensy,</HI> which makes a perfect <HI>Mad man</HI> of him.</P>
<P>Truly, the World is almost an <HI>Entire Bethlem,</HI> and none but that infinite Wisdom, which keeps the <HI>Waves of the Sea,</HI> within their Bounds, could Govern the <HI>Madness,</HI> and manage the Exorbi|tancies and Confusions of it.</P>
<P>Let us a little reflect upon the <HI>Symp|tomes</HI> of MADNESS, which appear in the <HI>Lives</HI> of ungodly men.</P>
<P>First. An ungodly man, <HI>Believes</HI> like a <HI>Mad man.</HI> His <HI>Fancy,</HI> like a <HI>mad mans&punc;</HI> is disturbed and depraved, and he hath very Ridiculous Opinions in his mind. His <HI>madness</HI> lies in that, in Isa. 5. 20. To <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> evil good, and rood evil;</HI> to <HI>put
<PB N="6" REF="000655_0007_0FA9A45F6F1A22D0">
darkness for light, and light for darkness.</HI> He hath such <HI>Frantick Whimseys</HI> in him! What thinks he of God? He <HI>madly</HI> thinks, <HI>God is altogether such an one, as my self.</HI> What thinks he of Christ? He <HI>madly</HI> thinks, <HI>Christ is a Stumbling|block and Foolishness.</HI> What will he think of Religion? He <HI>madly</HI> thinks, <HI>What is the Almighty that I should serve Him, and what profit shall I have, if I pray un|to Him?</HI> He hath <HI>mad</HI> Thoughts a|bout <HI>Sin,</HI> as if, <HI>The Stolen Waters of it were sweet.</HI> He hath <HI>mad</HI> Thoughts about the <HI>World,</HI> as if, <HI>Here were his Resting place.</HI> And he hath as <HI>mad.</HI> Thoughts about himself: with a <HI>Laodi|cean madness</HI> in him, he counts himself, <HI>Rich and Increased in Goods and having Need of Nothing,</HI> when he is <HI>Wretched and Miserable and poor and blind and na|ked.</HI> Go into a <HI>Case de Locos</HI> among the proud Spaniards, and you shall see one fancying himself a <HI>King,</HI> another a <HI>Pope,</HI> and a third, an <HI>Emperour.</HI> Such a Swelling <HI>madness</HI> is in every ungodly man; he do's really count himself, <HI>The best man in the World.</HI> The Word used for <HI>madness,</HI> in our Text, is one that carries <HI>Pride</HI> in the Signification of it.
<PB N="7" REF="000655_0008_0FA9A4602EE26D18">
The Vapours of <HI>Pride</HI> have disordered the Head of an ungodly man. And in all his Thoughts, he will be sure to Contradict whatever the Blessed God ha's Revel'd unto us.</P>
<P>Secondly. An Ungodly man, <HI>Chooses</HI> like a <HI>Mad man.</HI> We say, <HI>Quis nisi ment is Inops?</HI> Who but a <HI>mad-man</HI> will Refuse offered <HI>Gold,</HI> and prefer a Counter, or a Gew-gaw, before it? It is the way to Try a <HI>Fool;</HI> set a piece of <HI>Gold,</HI> and some sorry <HI>Trifle</HI> before him; if he choose the <HI>Trifle</HI> rather than the <HI>Gold,</HI> he is, <HI>A Fool.</HI> Such a <HI>Mad fool</HI> is every ungodly man! His <HI>Choise</HI> is mentioned in Isai. 66. 3. <HI>They have chosen their own ways, and their soul delights in their Abominations.</HI> There are Various Objects presented unto the <HI>Choise</HI> of the Sinner; but what a <HI>Choise</HI> do's he make? There is both <HI>Life Eternal</HI> and <HI>Eternal Death</HI> set before him; but so <HI>mad</HI> is he, that he chooses <HI>Death</HI> rather than<HI>Life.</HI> His prodigi|ous <HI>Choise</HI> is that in Jere. 2. 13. <HI>They have forsaken the Fountain of Living waters, and have hewenthem out Cisterns, broken Cisterns, that can hold no water.</HI> What a <HI>mad man</HI> is he? On the one
<PB N="8" REF="000655_0009_0FA9A460EDFE1028">
side, <HI>Wisdom</HI> offers unto the Sinner, <HI>Spiritual Riches and Spiritual Honours, &amp; Eternal Priviledges;</HI> on the other side, <HI>Satan</HI> offers unto him. <HI>A few Short-liv'd sensual Delights, that shall forfeit all the Blessings of the New Covenant forever;</HI> but like a <HI>mad-man</HI> he chooses the of|fers of <HI>Satan</HI> before those of <HI>Wisdom.</HI> He may have his <HI>Choise,</HI> and that pro|fer is made unto him, <HI>Ask what thou wil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> have, and thou shalt have it, though there be more than the half of a Kingdom in it.</HI> But this <HI>Mad-man,</HI> he chooses a <HI>Straw</HI> before a <HI>Crown,</HI> before a <HI>Throne.</HI> He chooses a <HI>Daughel,</HI> yea, a <HI>Dungeon,</HI> before a <HI>Kingdom.</HI> He had rather have <HI>Husks</HI> with <HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">gs,</HI> than <HI>Bread in the Heavenly Fathers House.</HI> A <HI>Pebble</HI> Stone, or a <HI>Barley</HI> Corn, is of more Esteem with him, than the <HI>Pearl of great price.</HI> Behold, a very Stupendous <HI>Madness</HI> here!</P>
<P>Thirdly. An Ungodly man ha's the <HI>Rashness,</HI> and <HI>Boldness,</HI> of a <HI>mad-man</HI> in him. He troubles not himself with any, <HI>Wherefores,</HI> and, <HI>What if's?</HI> He do's not ask himself, <HI>Wherefore did I come into the World?</HI> Nor, <HI>What if I go out of the World before I have made better Provision for it?</HI> He is one of
<PB N="9" REF="000655_0010_0FA9A461AFAB0890">
those, whose Pourtraiture we have in Prov. 27.12. <HI>The Simple pass on and are Punished.</HI> He Drinks all that he sees before him, and he never ponders, <HI>Is there no poison in it?</HI> He is not Sol|licitous about the Dangers, and the Downfalls, which he is continually Expos'd unto. And hence he permits himself to be cheated, worse than ever any <HI>mad-man</HI> was. Doubtless, <HI>Adam</HI> was <HI>Mad,</HI> when he suffered himself to be cheated of his Innocence and his Paradise, with an <HI>Apple?</HI> The <HI>Devil</HI> is a notable Hu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ster and Juggler! and he cheats the <HI>mad</HI> Sinner of all he ha's; the <HI>mad</HI> Creature will part with his precious <HI>Time,</HI> though all the An|gels in Heaven cannot Recal one <HI>Lost Hour</HI> of it; and he will part with his Immortal <HI>Soul,</HI> though the <HI>Gain of the whole World,</HI> would not Repair the <HI>Loss;</HI> The Devil gets these things of him, for a <HI>Song.</HI> And he runs as <HI>Mad Ventures,</HI> as he makes <HI>Mad Bar|gains.</HI> There is that foaming <HI>Madness</HI> in him, that he Values not the Ter|rors of the Almighty God; He hears the <HI>Threatnings</HI> of God; He sees the <HI>Judgments</HI> of God, for Sin, and yet he
<PB N="10" REF="000655_0011_0FA9A4626DFA89D0">
will, <HI>Go on still in his Trespasses.</HI> He do's, as we read in Jere. 8. 6. <HI>As the Horse rusheth into the Battel.</HI> Though he is fairly Warned, that if he Venture on in his Evil ways, the Omnipotent God will make him feel the force of His Iron Fiery Arms, <HI>What cares he?</HI> He goes on in the <HI>Rage</HI> of Sin, and <HI>mocking at fear,</HI> he playes with Folly before the Canons Roaring Mouth. Such a furious <HI>Mad-man</HI> the ungodly Sinner is!</P>
<P>Fourthly. An ungodly man, like a <HI>mad-man,</HI> endeavours the <HI>Hurt</HI> of all are about him; especially of those by whom his own <HI>Good</HI> is most Endeavoured. His <HI>madness,</HI> makes him given to <HI>mischief.</HI> We read in Eccl. 10. 13; about, <HI>Mischievous madness.</HI> That is it which the Sinner is under the continual Hurries of; and as tis said in Prov. 10. 23. <HI>It is a Sport unto a Fool to do mischief.</HI> He is always doing <HI>mischief</HI> to <HI>himself.</HI> He do's what is worse than tearing his own Hair, cut|ting his own <HI>Flesh,</HI> and killing his own <HI>Children,</HI> which <HI>mad-men</HI> use to do for with a Thousand Stabs and Wounds he <HI>Wrongs his own Soul.</HI> And, he is
<PB N="11" REF="000655_0012_0FA9A4632DEC31F0">
doing <HI>mischief</HI> to <HI>where</HI> too as fast as he can. The <HI>Estate,</HI> and <HI>Credit,</HI> and <HI>Health</HI> of his Neighbours all fare the worse for him; they find him, <HI>A Mad-man casting Fire-brands and Ar|rows and Death.</HI> Nor is he content to Go to Hell alone, but he draws <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">as many with him thither as he can. But especially, if any man shall go to Re|strain him or Oppose him in his Ex|travagancies, this <HI>mad-man</HI> will grow yet more outrageous at it. It was a Quality which <HI>Balaam</HI> was marked for, in 2 Pet. 2. 16. <HI>The Madness of the Prophet.</HI> Wherein did he show his <HI>Madness?</HI> In this; That when he met with a Stop in his way, it flung him into such a Passion, that there was no coming a near him. Tis thus with such a man; <HI>Tell him the Truth,</HI> and hee'l treat you like the most mortal and cruel Adversary: Go to Stop him, or bind him, or thwait him, and you had as good <HI>Meet a Bear bereaved of her Whelps.</HI> And hence his Vexation Spends it self upon the Faithful Mini|sters of God with a peculiar Animosi|ty; if he see such an one, he crys out, <HI>That man, I hate him!</HI> if he meet
<PB N="12" REF="000655_0013_0FA9A463EDEB1C98">
such an one, he crys out, <HI>Have I found thee, O mine Enemy?</HI> He cannot En|dure to be Controlled in his Wick|edness.</P>
<P>Fifthly. The ungodly man has, <HI>The Devil in him.</HI> There is an Unaccoun|tablean Unexpressible Interest of <HI>Satan</HI> oftentimes in the Distemp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters"> <HI>madness.</HI> It was a common sentiment among the Jews of old, That <HI>madness</HI> was of|tentimes produced by an <HI>Invasion</HI> and <HI>Possession</HI> of Evil Spirits; Especially, if the <HI>madness</HI> were <HI>Sine Febri.</HI> Hence they said in one of their Slanderous Blasphemies against our Lord, as in Joh. 10. 20. <HI>He hath a Devil, and is mad.</HI> It is often some <HI>Devil,</HI> which takes Advantage of the Poisonous <HI>Fires</HI> which madness is inflamed with, to carry on the hideous Hurly Burly's that are in the minds of the Distempe|red. Hence also t'was said concern|ing one that was <HI>mad,</HI> in Match. 17. 15,18. <HI>He is Lunatick;</HI> that is, one Dis|tracted at certain Times of the <HI>Moon.</HI> And it follows; <HI>Jesus rebuked the De|vil.</HI> Be sure, An ungodly Sinner ha's this point of <HI>madness</HI> in him, That he is under a Remarkable Energy of the
<PB N="13" REF="000655_0014_0FA9A464ADE2AC70">
<HI>Devil.</HI> It was said unto a Cheater, in Act. 5. 3. <HI>Why hath Satan filled thine Heart?</HI> And so it may be said of every other Sinner, <HI>Satan hath a Strong-hold in the Heart of such a Sinner.</HI> He hath gi|ven himself up to the Devil, resolving and engaging, <HI>To walk after the Prince of the power of the Air.</HI> He ha's a thousand times over said unto <HI>Satan,</HI> as <HI>Ahab</HI> to the Syrian, <HI>I am thine and all that I have.</HI> And hereupon, He is mov'd by the <HI>Devil,</HI> and led by the <HI>Devil</HI> in his whole Conversation. This is his <HI>Madness while he Lives!</HI></P>
<P>But what becomes of him after|wards: This is the Business of</P>
<P>The Second PROPOSITION,</P>
<P>Which we ought <HI>Soberly</HI> to me|ditate a while upon. You are now to hear, That</P>
<P><HI>A Sad Death is that which the Incureable Madness of ungodly men brings them at length unto.</HI></P>
<P>This is a Thing that should reach the Heart of every Person here; but especially of those who by a more sen|sible Approach of Death, have it said unto them, <HI>Set thy Soul in Order, for thou shalt Dy and not Live.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="000655_0015_0FA9A4656DEA3620">
First, there is a <HI>Natural Death</HI> which ungodly men must have Experience of. They must <HI>Go to the Dead,</HI> which by Rotting in the <HI>Grave.</HI> This is a thing which there is no avoiding and, <HI>There is no discharge in this War</HI> Will the <HI>Wealth</HI> of the ungodly man Excuse him from Dying? No. Tis said, in Psal. 49. 6. <HI>They that boast themselves in the multitude of Riches, con|tact Redeem from the Stroke of Death.</HI> Will the <HI>Strength</HI> of the ungodly man Excuse him from Dying? No. Tis said in Job 21. 23. <HI>One Dyes in his full strength.</HI> Will his <HI>Hunour</HI> Protect him from it? No. T'was said in Psal. 82. 6,7. <HI>I have said, ye are Gods, but ye shall Dy like men.</HI> Will his <HI>Wisdom</HI> defend him? NO. T'was said in Psal. 49. 10. <HI>The Wise men Dy.</HI> The man must come to it, whether he will, or no. And there is a double <HI>sadness</HI> in the <HI>Natu|ral Death</HI> of an ungodly man.</P>
<P>First. His <HI>Natural Death</HI> is the Ex|ecution of a Divine and a Dreadful <HI>Curse</HI> upon him. It was Gods <HI>Curse</HI> for our <HI>Sin,</HI> in Gen. 3. 17. <HI>Thou shall surely Dy.</HI> The <HI>Sting</HI> is taken out of that <HI>Curse,</HI> to the true Believer, and
<PB N="15" REF="000655_0016_0FA9A46630B44EB8">
the <HI>Snake</HI> ha's more of <HI>Cordial</HI> than of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> in it. But the Death of an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> comes upon him, as part of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> and <HI>Satisfaction</HI> which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Justice of God calleth <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> <HI>Justice</HI> of the Great God, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> not let such a Transgressor Live; but will <HI>Pay</HI> him home the <HI>Wages;</HI> that his Faults make due unto him. The Blessed God will not let his Creatures any longer <HI>groan</HI> under the <HI>Burden</HI> of serving such a Monster, and therefore. He gives to His Officer <HI>Death,</HI> such an order as this, <HI>Go Marshal, Take some away, carry him to his own place!</HI></P>
<P>Secondly. His <HI>Natural Death</HI> hath often some very Dismal <HI>Circumstances</HI> to Embitter it. It is said of some, in Jere. 16. 4. <HI>They shall Dy of Grievous Deaths.</HI> There occurs frequently some <HI>Grievous</HI> Accident, in the Death of a notoriously ungodly man. Perhaps there may be some <HI>Grievous</HI> Plagues and Pains upon him in his Dying Hours. Or, an <HI>Early Death,</HI> and also a <HI>Sudden Death,</HI> which is a <HI>Grievous Death</HI> to a man that ha's not made his Peace with God, though it be not so to a Believer; <HI>such</HI> a Death may be his portion. Yea,
<PB N="16" REF="000655_0017_0FA9A466EF4B6048">
it may be that a <HI>Violent Death</HI> may sieze upon him, and this by the Hands of a Common Executioner; the <HI>Sword</HI> of Civil Justice may take him off, and <HI>Men Clapping their Hands at him, hiss him out of his Place.</HI> This is the <HI>Grie|vous Death</HI> which many a forlorn Creature comes unto. But it were well if <HI>This</HI> were all. There are yet more terrible things to be laid before you. For,</P>
<P>Secondly, There is an <HI>Eternal Death</HI> which ungodly men are Obnoxious unto. They must <HI>Go to the Dead</HI> which ly Roaring in the Fiery Bottom of Hell forever. <HI>Death</HI> arrives unto them, with such an horrible Train, as we have represented in Rev. 6. 8. <HI>Behold, a Pale Horse, and his Name that satt thereon was</HI> Death, <HI>and Hell follow'd with him.</HI> Ay, This is that which makes their <HI>Death</HI> look so <HI>Pale,</HI> so Ghastly, so Hideous; <HI>Hell followes!</HI> It is that whereof we are told more than once in the <HI>Old</HI> Testament, as in Psal. 9. 17. <HI>The wicked shall be turned into Hell.</HI> And that it may no want <HI>Sufficient Witnesses,</HI> we have it over and over Confirmed in the <HI>New,</HI> as in Math. 25. 46. <HI>The
<PB N="17" REF="000655_0018_0FA9A467C64869E8">
Wicked shall go away into Everlasting Punishment.</HI> If a man go Christless and Graceless out of <HI>This</HI> World, he passes unto Various Torments in <HI>Ano|ther;</HI> and these make up the <HI>Second Death.</HI></P>
<P>Now the <HI>Sadness</HI> of the <HI>Eternal Death,</HI> which falls upon an ungodly man, ha's these Aggravations in it.</P>
<P>First. It is an <HI>Intolerable Anguish</HI> which he shall then be Tortured with. Doubtless there will be multitudes of Miseries to Cruciate the ungodly man among the Damned In all those things wherein he can be <HI>Sensible,</HI> he shall be <HI>Miserable.</HI> But there are especially two things which <HI>Hell</HI> consisteth of; and those two the Scripture calls in Mark 9. <HI>sin.: A Fire,</HI> and, <HI>A Worm.</HI> There shall be a <HI>Fire,</HI> to Vex and Scald upon a Damned Soul; and what shall that <HI>Fire</HI> be? Truly, It shall be the <HI>Wrath,</HI> the fierce and hot <HI>Wrath</HI> of the Great God, making Immediate Im|pressions upon the souls. It is said, in Heb. 12. 29. <HI>Our God is a Consuming Fire. Our God,</HI> Will then flash in very <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Rebakes upon the Sinner, and (as <HI>Paul</HI> speaks) he shall be; <HI>Destroy'ed
<PB N="18" REF="000655_0019_0FA9A46929673E40">
By the Presence of the Lord.</HI> There shall also be a <HI>Worm,</HI> to Gnaw the very Vitals of a Damned Soul; and that <HI>Worm</HI> shall be an Enraged <HI>Conscience,</HI> making most Angry and Horrid Re|flections upon the Condition of the Soul. It is said in Prov. 1. 31. <HI>They shall be Filled with their own Devices.</HI> Out of the Sinners own <HI>Corruption</HI> will be bred a <HI>Viper,</HI> that shall keep feeding forever upon his very Heart within him. Alas, my Friends, what a for|midable <HI>Death</HI> is this? They that have only tasted the Beginnings of it, in a <HI>Wounded Spirit</HI> here, have made the Town Ring with the Noises and Cla|mours of their Agonies. One so Vi|sited, over-hearing some body to speak about some Exquisite Anguishes, Cry'd out, <HI>All that is but a Metaphor to what I am feeling of!</HI> O what a <HI>Death</HI> is that unto which the worst of Deaths is but a <HI>Metaphor!</HI></P>
<P>Secondly. The <HI>Eternity of that Into|lerable Anguish,</HI> will render the <HI>Anguish</HI> yet more <HI>Intolerable.</HI> We have it thrice ever told unto us, in Mark 9 <HI>sin. The Worm Dyeth <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, and the Fire is not</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">. That the Calamities of the
<PB N="19" REF="000655_0020_0FA9A46939E5E640">
Damned will be <HI>Truly</HI> Eternal, is Evi|dent both from <HI>Scripture</HI> and <HI>Consent.</HI> The <HI>Scripture</HI> asserts the <HI>Eternity</HI> there|of, Expressing it by the very same word which is used to declare the <HI>E|ternity</HI> of God Himself; and it were easy to multiply Quotations for it. The <HI>Consent</HI> of Good men hereabout, hath been such, <HI>That the Church in all Ages hath Agreed in Receiving it as an Article of Religion.</HI> The <HI>Consent</HI> of Bad men hereabout, is discovered in the Indelible <HI>Suspicions</HI> and <HI>Jelousies</HI> there|of, which can by no means be wholly rooted out of their minds. That these Calamities will be <HI>Justly</HI> Eternal, is evident from This, That it is very <HI>Just</HI> for the measures of a <HI>Poenalty</HI> to be taken from the <HI>Quality</HI> of the Object Affronted and Offended by the <HI>Fault.</HI> As now; To kill a <HI>Fly,</HI> is a Sport for a <HI>Beggar,</HI> as well as an <HI>Emperour;</HI> but to Kill a <HI>Man,</HI> this is justly counted, a <HI>Capital Crime.</HI> Thus, It is an <HI>Infinite God</HI> that is Injured and Provoked by Our Sin. Hence an <HI>Infinite Wrath</HI> is but proportionable thereunto. We cannot sustain a Revenge <HI>Infinite</HI> for the <HI>Intention</HI> of it; hence one <HI>Infinite</HI>
<PB N="20" REF="000655_0021_0FA9A469EDD65830">
for the <HI>Duration</HI> of it, is but very Rea|sonable. Here then make another Pause! What an Astonishing <HI>Death</HI> is this? To be under Inconceivable Vexations, for as many Millions of Ages, as there are <HI>Stars</HI> in the Sky, or <HI>Sands</HI> on the Shore, or <HI>Drops</HI> within the Ocean, and yet be no nearer to the period of them, than the first Mo|ment they began! <HI>Ah! Lord, I am afraid of thy Judgments!</HI> Well might once a poor Sinner say, <HI>If I were to Endure the wrath of God for a Thousand years, I might go through it; but Eterni|ty, Eternity, that Amazes me!</HI></P>
<P>But what Improvement is to be made of such things as these? For the</P>

<P>There is both <HI>Comfort</HI> and <HI>Counsil</HI> hence to be laid before those that have beed Cured of their <HI>Madness</HI> by a true Conversion unto God. Some of us there are that have been brought unto a <HI>Right sense</HI> of things, by the <HI>Renewing of the Holy Spirit,</HI> and unto a just Con|templation and Reformation of our Manners. We may indeed with much Humility look back, and say with the

Apostle, in Act. 26. 11. <HI>I was once Ex|ceeding mad.</HI> We were <HI>Mad</HI> and worse than so, when we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>without God,</HI> and <HI>without Christ,</HI> and <HI>without Hope,</HI> and went along without <HI>Fear</HI> or <HI>Wit,</HI> in the Lew'd Courses of our Unregeneracy. But our God ha's reduced us unto a blessed measure of <HI>Sobriety,</HI> by <HI>Changing of our Hearts</HI> within us. Now,</P>
<P>First. There is Rich matter of <HI>Comfort,</HI> in our Cure. Our Deliverance foretels many <HI>Comfortable</HI> Things unto us; but <HI>This</HI> Particularly, <HI>That</HI> it will not be a <HI>Sad,</HI> but a <HI>Sweet</HI> kind of <HI>Death,</HI> which we must quickly Encounter with. We shall shortly <HI>Go to the Dead;</HI> and this is one of the Greatest, the Blackest Fears that we are Afflicted with. But, be now assured, <HI>Ye Reco|vered Souls,</HI> That when you <HI>go to the Dead,</HI> you shall not <HI>Go to the Mad.</HI> In|deed you shall then be <HI>Gathered unto your People,</HI> as tis said, <HI>Abraham</HI> was.

T'wil be but go|ing from a World full of Dangerous <HI>Madmen,</HI> unto the most <HI>Reasonable</HI> and most <HI>Desireable</HI> Society that ever was.

<P>But, Secondly, We are to find mat|ter of <HI>Counsil,</HI> on our Cure. Particu|larly,</P>
<P>First, Let us be <HI>Thankful</HI> that we are <HI>Cured</HI> our selves.

We are now con|cerned, that you may not <HI>Go down to the Congregation of the Dead,</HI> before your <HI>Madness</HI> be, Sufficiently rooted out of your Souls.</P>
<P>I am to tell you,</P>
<P>First, That you have been fearfully <HI>Mad</HI> all this While. You were indeed <HI>Born like the Wild Asses Colt,</HI> and so you have lived all your Days, Was it not a <HI>mad</HI> thing for you, to follow the Motions of the <HI>Devil,</HI> rather than to follow the Motions of the <HI>Saviour,</HI> as you have done in all your Conversa|tion?

<P>Secondly, That a true <HI>Repentance</HI> is the Thing your <HI>Madness</HI> must be Rectify'd withal. Tis <HI>Repentance,</HI> which must <HI>Undo</HI> now in a few days, all that you have been <HI>Doing</HI> ever since you came into the World. <HI>Repentance,</HI> I say; a Great-Word: What is <HI>Repen|tance,</HI> but a <HI>Growing Wise-again?</HI> You have been <HI>mad;</HI> but by <HI>Repentance</HI> you must Bewayl, and Confess, and For|sake all your <HI>Madness;</HI> and by <HI>Repen|tance</HI> you must Repair to the Lord Je|sus for the Redress of all thee. <HI>Guilt,</HI> and all that <HI>Wo,</HI> which by your <HI>Mad|ness</HI> you are involved in.

his Execution: being rebuked for it, he answered, <HI>Pray, Envy me not my Grapes, I have paid for them dear enough!</HI> Alas, you may say the like of all your <HI>Mad</HI> Courses, <HI>I have Paid dear, or those forbidden Grapes!</HI> But for that very cause, you should now throw them all away. You are <HI>mad,</HI> and worse than so, till a Profound <HI>Repentance</HI> be disco|vered in you. Among the Romans of old, They that were under a Pub|lick <HI>Accusation,</HI> betook themselves to a Squalid and Ragged <HI>Habit,</HI> a dejected <HI>Countenance,</HI> and the <HI>Hair</HI> of their Head; and Face neglected; and One famous man procured a Banishment, because he would not submit unto the Cere|monies. Doubtless, he was <HI>mad!</HI> Surely, All that can show <HI>Repentance</HI> well becomes you, that are now ar|riv'd unto a righteous <HI>Condemnation;</HI> neither <HI>Earth</HI> must keep you, nor will <HI>Heaven</HI> receive you, if your <HI>madness</HI> continue any longer.</P>
<P>I am to tell you, Thirdly, That if you know leave of <HI>your madness,</HI> you shall Experience <HI>Gods Mercy</HI> forever Indeed, if your <HI>madness</HI> continue a little more, you shall be Turned out not into a

Nevertheless, Tis a very <HI>Unrea|sonable thing</HI> which I now have to set before you; and a Million <HI>Deaths</HI> will be the portion of the man, that Encou|rageth himself to any further <HI>madness,</HI> from what I am going to say. But it is this, None of all your past <HI>madness</HI> will keep you out of the Kingdom of God, if you are now <HI>Sober</HI> for the re|maining Hours that are before you. Though you are <HI>Going,</HI> you are not yet <HI>Gone to the Dead.</HI> Well, there is yet a <HI>Door of Hope</HI> set open for you; Come in, and Welcome. We read concerning the <HI>mad</HI> Prodigal, That when he <HI>Came to himself,</HI> then his Father <HI>met</HI> him and <HI>kis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> him with a wonderful Affiction.

<P>I am to tell you, Lastly; That if your own madness be Cured, you will study very much to prevent the <HI>madness</HI> of o|ther <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">. You-will then Labour to Con|vince and Caution all that are about you, about those <HI>Pathes of the Destroyer</HI>

<P>First, If you would know, WHEN, the Displeasure of God shall break upon the Heads of ungodly Sinners, You are here informed, <HI>They Dy in Youth.</HI> It seems, That an <HI>Early Death,</HI> a <HI>Death</HI> in the Prime, and Spring of their Days, is that whereunto they make themselves Obnoxious.

<P>We have two <HI>Assertions</HI> here to be Advanced and mentioned.</P>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="assertion">
<HEAD>Assertion. I.</HEAD>
<P>As a <HI>Wicked</HI> Life in general may be called, an <HI>Unclean</HI> one, so an <HI>Unclean,</HI> Life, in particular is a very <HI>Wicked</HI> one. It is true, That all <HI>Wickedness,</HI> is called <HI>Un|cleanness,</HI> in those Oracles, of Truth, which never miscalled any thing. Thus, the <HI>Wicked</HI> Nature which we were all born into the World withal, ha's that said of it, in Job 14.4. <HI>It is an Unclean thing.</HI> Thus, the <HI>Wicked</HI> Person who do's Re|nounce God, ha's that said of him, in Eccl. 9.2. <HI>He is Unclean.</HI> All our Sin|fulness, is call'd, <HI>A Filthiness of Flesh &amp; Spirit.</HI> When a Child of God ha's asked, for a Deliverance from Sin, he so Ex|presses it, <HI>Wash me thoroughly from my Iniquity, and Cleanse me from my Sin.</HI> And a man that Lives in Sin against the God that made him, is denominated in Job 15.16. <HI>An Abominable and Filthy man.</HI> Why? Because the most Loathsome. Dirty, Nasty Object in the World, is not so Distastful unto us, as all <HI>Wickedness</HI> is unto our God, who is, <HI>Not a God that
<PB N="41" REF="000655_0042_0FA9A479ADDBEDE0">
hath pleasure in Wickedness.</HI></P>
<P>But then there is One peculiar sort of <HI>Wickedness,</HI> which the Term of <HI>Un|cleanness</HI> is more strictly put upon; tis the Violation of that <HI>Chastity,</HI> which is Enjoyned upon us, by the Seventh Com|mandment, in the <HI>Holy, &amp; Just, &amp; Good,</HI> Laws of our God. And why is this <HI>Luxury</HI> called <HI>Uncleanness,</HI> but because of a Special <HI>Filthiness,</HI> and <HI>Ugliness,</HI> which this Vice is attended with? Indeed, such is the Wretchedness of the Corrupti|on, in man, that it is hardly safe so much as to mention in his Hea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ing, the Several kinds of his Damnable <HI>Wickedness.</HI> It was the Apostolical Council, in Eph. 5.3. <HI>All Uncleanness, let it not be once Named among you.</HI> And accordingly, The Holy Spirit of God here in our Text, as well as else where, has used a Notable <HI>Anti|phrasis,</HI> to describe the worst <HI>Uncleanness</HI> by. The word for, <HI>The Unclean,</HI> is <HI>The Ho|ly;</HI> because tis not easy to find any word Convenient and Emphatical Enough, to set out the detestable <HI>Unholiness,</HI> that is in such <HI>Uncleanness.</HI> However, we may with some Scripture-Phrases indigitate the Chief of those Diabolical Pranks, that are Committed by those whose
<PB N="42" REF="000655_0043_0FA9A47A6F81BE40">
<HI>Life is among the Unclean.</HI> Breefly,</P>
<P>There is then a Cursed <HI>Self-Pollution,</HI> which is usually the first Pit of <HI>Unclean|ness,</HI> where into they fall, that are, <HI>The Abhorred of the Lord.</HI> Wretches there are, that like Wicked <HI>Onan,</HI> do so Sacrifice their seed unto the Devil: and these are meant by those <HI>Effoeminate,</HI> concern|ing whom tis said, in 1 Cor. 6&punc;9,10. <HI>Be not Deceived, They shall not Inherit the Kingdom of God.</HI></P>
<P>There is next, an Odious <HI>Fornication,</HI> which is a further Step, of that <HI>Unclean|ness,</HI> where unto the Raging Lusts of men do carry them. Tis that, wherein <HI>Un|wedded</HI> Persons, of both Sexes, do pros|titute themselves; and it is reckoned a|mong those <HI>Works of the Flesh,</HI> whereof we are assured in Gal.5. 20,21. <HI>They which do such Things, shall not Inherit the Kingdom.</HI></P>
<P>If they that have been thus&punc; <HI>Unclean,</HI> do come to <HI>Marry,</HI> it is well if the <HI>Un|clean Spirit</HI> still haunt them not. The<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> are Inexpressible <HI>Uncleanness,</HI> in the Married Stare, which the word of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> has Branded, in Col. 3.5. Under the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the of, <HI>Inordinate Affection; for which Things sale the Wrath of God comes upon the Children of Disobedience.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="000655_0044_0FA9A47B2F460D00">
And sometimes, the <HI>Uncleanness</HI> grows into <HI>Adultery;</HI> Yea, Perhaps a doubled <HI>Adultery:</HI> wherein the <HI>Marriage-Cove|nant</HI> is fearfully broken by Sinful Crea|tures, that shake off the <HI>Yoke</HI> of God, imposed from <HI>the Beginning.</HI> The Ini|quity so often Damned in the Word of God; but especially in Prov. 6. 29,32. <HI>Whosoever touches his Neighbours Wife, shall not be Innocent; whose Committeth Adul|tery with a Woman, Lacketh understanding; he that doeth it, destroyeth his own soul.</HI></P>
<P>Sometimes also, There is an <HI>Incest</HI> per|petrated in that <HI>Uncleanness,</HI> whereto the Hellish <HI>Fires</HI> in the Hearts of men do carry them. They will needs invade that Comfortable, and Profitable, <HI>Order,</HI> which God has Established in Humane Society, as now increased, for the Pro|pagation of mankind. It was the Edict of Heaven, in Lev. 18.6. <HI>None of you shall approach to any, that is near of kin to him.</HI> And to show, that such and such De|grees were not forbidden unto <HI>Israel</HI> a|lone the Lord adds, <HI>For in all these the Nations are Defiled, which I cast out before you.</HI></P>
<P>Yea, which is horrible to be Spoken! such a Vile <HI>Uncleanness,</HI> do some among the debased Children of men, sink down
<PB N="44" REF="000655_0045_0FA9A47BF0313C08">
into, that <HI>Sodomy</HI> and <HI>Buggery</HI> it self, ha's been among their Crimes. The Great God ha's had Occasion to issue out such precepts, as those, in Lev. 18.22,23&mdash;against such unutterable <HI>Abomina|tions</HI> and <HI>Confusions.</HI> Alas, There is in <HI>Europe,</HI> a Land Professing the Christian Religion, where such Devillish Practices are, they say, very frequent; but flam|ing <HI>Fire</HI> from Heaven will shortly de|stroy that <HI>Accursed Land.</HI> Nay, And in this <HI>Land of Uprightness</HI> too there have been some that have thus <HI>Dealt Wickedly.</HI> And I have one very wonderful Exam|ple to tell you of it. In the Southern Parts of this Country, about the Year 1641. a <HI>Beast</HI> brought forth a Creature that had something of an <HI>Humane shape.</HI> This Monster had a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">lemi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">h in one <HI>Eye,</HI> just like what a loose Lew'd Fellow in the Town, was known to have. This greater Monster, being upon this Account <HI>Suspected,</HI> was <HI>Examined</HI> upon that suspi|cion, and upon his Examination Confes|sed his Guilt of most infandous Bestia|lities, for which he underwent a deserv|ed Execution. You hear what the <HI>Acts</HI> of <HI>Uncleanness</HI> are; but I am to tell you, That there are <HI>Unclean Thoughts,</HI>
<PB N="45" REF="000655_0046_0FA9A47CAED1D318">
which are Prohibited by the Lord our God; even as in Math. 5.28. <HI>A Looking upon a Woman to Last after her.</HI> And there are <HI>Unclean Words,</HI> which are also Prohi|bited; Even, as in Eph.5.4. <HI>Filthiness &amp; Foolish Talking.</HI> In all of these things, there is <HI>Uncleanness.</HI> But what shall be said of this <HI>Uncleanness.</HI> In one Word, It is a <HI>Wickedness.</HI> Tis Rebuked every where the whole <HI>Bible</HI> over. Bat indeed, I need not Appeal unto the <HI>Bible,</HI> to prove the <HI>Wickedness</HI> of <HI>Uncleanness.</HI> The Natural <HI>Reason</HI> and <HI>Conscience</HI> in man, will testify unto it. Even an <HI>Abimelek,</HI> a Philistine, will pronounce it, <HI>A Great Sin.</HI> Until the Souls of men, come to be debauched, into the Vilest of Degen|eracies, they cannot but see a World of <HI>Wickedness</HI> in this <HI>Uncleanness.</HI> Why, the plain <HI>Wrongs</HI> which all the Unclean do both to themselves, and others, are e|nough to make every sensible Person, say, <HI>God forbid, I should ever do such Wickedness!</HI> Wherefore, to pass on.</P>

First. The Death of the <HI>Unclean,</HI> is like to be an <HI>Early Death.</HI> Of <HI>Unclean|ness,</HI> we may say as the Wise man says of the <HI>Adulteress,</HI> in Prov. 6.26. <HI>It will bent for the Precious Life.</HI> The <HI>Life</HI> will be by that Sin, quickly prey'd upon.

is, like also to be a <HI>Woful Death.</HI> There are indeed Innumerable <HI>Woes,</HI> which they that Live in <HI>Uncleanness,</HI> are, while they <HI>Live,</HI> Exposed unto.
