<P>I TELL you, Lydia, I'll hear no more.&mdash; Plague on his virtues! When did a wi|thered, rotten tree produce good fruit? It is impo&s;&s;ible but the errors of the father mu&s;t, in &s;ome degree, attach them&s;elves to the &s;on: And I had rather (dear as you are to me) wit|ne&s;s your ob&s;equies, than &s;ee you in the arms of a man, who&s;e principles I de&s;pi&s;e. Old Screwpenny's &s;peculations, cheats, and frauds are related at every tea-table throughout the United States; and &s;hall the daughter of Ma|jor Upright, by a marriage with &s;uch a ra&s;|cal's &s;on, bring di&s;grace on the fair fame of her own father?</P>
</SP>

<P>My dear father, you know I have always regarded you as a friend, as well as pa|rent: you have ever been acquainted with the
<PB N="2" REF="031790_0006_0FEE639E34885958">
&s;ecrets of my heart, and you may re&s;t a&s;&s;ured, that my conduct &s;hall never be the cau&s;e of unea&s;ine&s;s to you. My acquaintance with Young Screwpenny commenced in England, whither your kindne&s;s &s;ent me for my educati|on; we were often together, and frequent in|timacy produced a mutual e&s;teem: We have &s;ince been fellow-pa&s;&s;engers from England, and his kind attentions to me, on &s;hip-board, cer|tainly have made an impre&s;&s;ion on my heart, which will require &s;ome time to eradicate.</P>

<SPEAKER>Major.</SPEAKER>
<P>I almo&s;t wi&s;h you had never &s;een England: the death of your mother, (who&s;e memory &s;till demands the &s;igh of tenderne&s;s) and, at that time, a want of good &s;eminaries for education in this country, induced me to &s;end you thither: But, thank heaven, we can now enjoy the ble&s;&s;ing of giving our children a &s;o|lid and u&s;eful education, without &s;ending them to a foreign country, where for every &s;ingle le&s;&s;on of utility they obtain, fifty follies &s;prout up to choak its growth:&mdash;Republicans can only be properly in&s;tructed in republican go|vernments. However, Lydia, I hope I &s;hall find in you, an exception to my general opinion.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Lydia.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope, &s;ir, you will believe I have &s;en&s;e enough to di&s;tingui&s;h between u&s;eful arts, and the tin&s;el of a modern Briti&s;h education. And believe me, &s;ir, were you acquainted with Mr. Charles Screwpenny, your prejudices a|gain&s;t the father would be lo&s;t in your admi|ration of the virtues of his &s;on.</P>

<P>Prejudices! What! when he cheat|ed my noble di&s;banded troops out of &s;even-eighths of the pay they had &s;o hardly earned, &s;o richly de&s;erved, and &s;o patiently waited for, is it a prejudice in me to call him a ra&s;|cal? &mdash;When I &s;ee him invariably &s;hifting his &s;entiments of politics, to the opinion of the &s;tronge&s;t party, merely to further his merce|nary views, is it a prejudice in me to de&s;pi&s;e him?&mdash;When I &s;ee him continually employ|ed in baneful monopolies, oppre&s;&s;ions, and land &s;peculations, di&s;tre&s;&s;ing the poor, and bringing di&s;grace, infamy, and di&s;honor on my country, is it a prejudice in me to hate and dete&s;t him? No! I hope Major Upright will always be remarked for love of virtue, and dete&s;tation of vice. But come, Lydia, &s;hould I find Young Screwpenny the character you have de&s;cribed him to be, far be it from me to oppo&s;e your happine&s;s; however it mu&s;t be on certain conditions; and &s;uch as will pre|vent the di&s;grace &s;uch a connexion will una|voidably tend to produce.</P>

'Dear &s;ir, when I la&s;t parted from you, I was over|whelmed with grief and di&s;appointment, I could not imagine my father &s;o unworthy as you repre&s;ented him:&mdash;Some circum&s;tances, added to his own confe&s;&s;ion, have opened my eyes to his true character; and although, as a &s;on, I cannot but grieve for his vices, yet duty to my&s;elf obliges me no longer to re&s;|pect him as the author of my being; con&s;ider|ing as I do, that he had better not have been &s;o, than afterwards to wi&s;h me, to de&s;pi&s;e all duties, &s;acred and moral, for the gratification of ambition and avarice. I &s;hall wait upon you this afternoon, and rea&s;&s;ure you, that, with the greate&s;t plea&s;ure, I accept your pro|po&s;als, with the hand of your mo&s;t lovely and amiable daughter; in the mean time, I remain your devoted, Charles Screwpenny.'&mdash;Now, Lydia, what do you think?</P>

<P>Think! My dear &s;ir, I am now convinced, and I am &s;ure I can depend upon his &s;entiments and honor:&mdash;The man who can de&s;pi&s;e vice even in a father, mu&s;t, in him&s;elf, be really good.</P>

<P>I think with you, Lydia, and feel no doubt of his virtue:&mdash;'Tis virtue alone, which rai&s;es man to the e&s;teem of his Creator; 'tis not the words of devotion, but the acti|ons of philanthrophy and ju&s;tice, that mu&s;t recommend him to that beneficent being, who delights to make happy, tho&s;e to whom he has given exi&s;tence.</P>
