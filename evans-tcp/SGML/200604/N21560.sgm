<HEAD>A SKETCH OF THE LIFE OF J. P. BRISSOT.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By the Editor.</BYLINE>
<P>HE was born at the village of Ouarville, near Chatres, in Oreannois, on the 14th of January, 1754. His father was what the French called a <HI>Traiteur;</HI> that is, keeper of an eating hou&s;e or an or|dinary. He was intended for the profe&s;&s;ion of the l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">w, and was articled to an attorney for that pur|po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e. But he grew di&s;gu&s;ted with the chicane and turpitude he was daily obliged to witne&s;s, and there|fore, after the five years of the article&s;hip were ex|pired, he left Chatres and went to Paris.</P>
<P>An accident one night at the theatre at Paris plac|ed him in the company of an Engli&s;h gentleman. They became intimate, and from this gentleman he obtained &s;ome knowledge of the Engli&s;h language; which he afterwards improved by a re&s;idence in London.</P>
<P>He had received a regular cla&s;&s;ical education, and acquired, by &s;trict application, a tolerable knowledge of the German, Italian, and Spani&s;h languages, &s;uf|ficient to con&s;ult the authors who have written in tho&s;e languages On his arrival at Paris, his fir&s;t

&s;tudy was juri&s;prudence, with an intention of be|coming an advocate in parliament. No &s;cience however e&s;caped his attention. He attended lec|tures and experiments in every branch of &s;cience; wherein his active genius found ample exerci&s;e. Chymi&s;try was his favourite object of pur&s;uit; but his circum&s;tances were too limited to indulge much in it. The &s;mall patrimony which he inherited from his father did not exceed forty pounds per annum.</P>
<P>In the year 1777 he made his fir&s;t tour to London. During his &s;tay in London he became engaged in the conduct of a French new&s;paper, at that time called the <HI>Courier de l' Europe,</HI> but &s;ince the <HI>Courier de Londres.</HI> Some mi&s;under&s;tanding having happened concerning the &s;tamps (at the &s;tamp-office in Lon|don) for this paper, the proprietor took a re&s;olution of printing it at Boulogne &s;ur-mer; and Bri&s;&s;ot was appointed the Editor, and re&s;ided at Boulogne for that purpo&s;e. He continued in this capacity at Bou|logne about two years. From thence he went to Paris, and was admitted Coun&s;ellor in Parliament.&mdash; Early in the year 1782 he went to Neu&s;chatel to &s;u|perintend the printing of one of his books (mentioned hereafter). This was the memorable period of the revolution at Geneva. Here he became acquainted with M. Claviere and M. du Rovray, who, with a numerous party, were expelled that city, and &s;ought an a&s;ylum in Ireland.</P>
<P>In the autumn of this year, he married a daughter of Madame Dupont of Boulogne. This young lady had been recommended to the celebrated Madame de Genlis, who obtained a &s;ituation for her in the nur&s;ery of the Duke de Chartres, late Duke of Or|leans, who &s;uffered under the guillotine; in which &s;ituation &s;he continued &s;ome time after her marriage.</P>
<P>At the beginning of the year 1783, he vi&s;ited London a &s;econd time. His view in this journey was to e&s;tabli&s;h in London, a Lyceum, or Academy
<PB N="v" REF="028343_0005_0FD8AEB76C34D560">
of Arts and Sciences, together with an office of ge|neral corre&s;pondence. In this undertaking he was encouraged by &s;ome of the fir&s;t literary men in France; and a Mon&s;ieur du Forge, mu&s;ician at Pa|ris, was &s;o captivated with the &s;cheme, that he ad|vanced four thou&s;and livres, (166 l.) for one third &s;hare of the profits. Bri&s;&s;ot was to have the &s;ole ma|nagement, and the other two thirds of the profits. He took a hou&s;e in Newman-&s;treet, Oxford-&s;treet; and publi&s;hed a pro&s;pectus of his undertaking. He &s;ent for his wife and his younge&s;t brother (his elde&s;t brother was a prie&s;t.) At this time he commenced his de&s;cription of the &s;ciences in England (mentioned hereafter) to be publi&s;hed monthly. Having in one of his publications taken occa&s;ion to vindicate the Chevalier Launay, editor of the <HI>Courier du Nord,</HI> printed at Mae&s;tricht, the editor of the <HI>Courier de l' Europe,</HI> now M. du Morande, was &s;o highly of|fended by it, that he became from that time Bri&s;&s;ot's mo&s;t determined enemy. It is to be ob&s;erved, that the Courier du Nord, and the Courier de l'Europe, were rival new&s;papers. De Launay quitted Mae&s;|tricht, and went to Paris, where he was immediately put into the Ba&s;tile, and was never more heard of.</P>
<P>In the month of May, 1784, Bri&s;&s;ot was arre&s;ted by his printer in London. Although he was at this time very well known to &s;everal per&s;ons of rank and fortune, yet he was too delicate to apply to any of them for pecuniary a&s;&s;i&s;tance. But after remaining a day or two in a lock-up hou&s;e in Gray's Inn Lane, he &s;ent his brother to an intimate friend, who in|&s;tantly paid the printer his bill, and liberated him.</P>
<P>The next morning Bri&s;&s;ot &s;et out for France, leaving his wife and brother in England, a&s;&s;uring them he would quickly return, which he certainly intended. But in this he was &s;everely di&s;appointed. Thus ended his literary enterpri&s;e of e&s;tabli&s;hing a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> in London, in which he embarked his
<PB N="vi" REF="028343_0006_0FD8AEB8AC9452B0">
whole property with a degree of infatuation and zeal that &s;eemed to border upon in&s;anity. During his re&s;idence in London he became acquainted with one Count de Pelleport, author of &s;everal pamphlets again&s;t the principal per&s;ons of the French Court, particularly of one called <HI>Soirees d'Antoinette,</HI> for the apprehen&s;ion of the author of which the French court offered a thou&s;and pounds (1000 Louis) re|ward. Bri&s;&s;ot, in&s;tead of proceeding directly to Pa|ris, &s;topped at Boulogne, and re&s;ided there with his mother-in-law: here he re&s;olved to continue his publication on the original plan. Du M&mdash; know|ing that Pelleport was the author of the offen&s;ive pamphlet, and that Bri&s;&s;ot and Pelleport were inti|mate, re&s;olved to obtain the reward, and gratify his re&s;entment. He applied to Pelleport, offering him the &s;uperintendance of a publication to be carried on at Bruges, (near O&s;tend,) the &s;alary of which was to be two hundred pounds per annum. Pelleport accepted the offer. But it was nece&s;&s;ary to &s;top at Boulogne, where &s;ome final arrangements were to be made. In the month of July, Pelleport embarked for Boulogne with Captain Meredith. But the moment he landed, he was &s;eized by the officers of the Police, who put him in chains and carried him to Paris, where he was &s;ent to the Ba&s;tile. Du M&mdash; was an agent of the Police of Paris. Information being given to the Police, that Bri&s;&s;ot was at Boulogne, and that he was the intimate friend of Pelleport, he was immediately taken into cu&s;tody, carried to Pa|ris, and committed to the Ba&s;tile. However, it is certain that Bri&s;&s;ot never wrote any thing again&s;t ei|ther the King or Queen of France. He was &s;incere in his abhorrence of the arbitrary and de&s;potic prin|ciples of the French government, but with re&s;pect to the private conduct of the King and Queen, he ne|ver be&s;towed the &s;malle&s;t attention upon it. In this magazine of human victims, he continued about &s;ix

weeks. His wife applied to Madame Genlis in his favour, and Madame Genlis mo&s;t generou&s;ly made a point of it with the Duke de Chartres to obtain his liberty. The Duke de Chartres's interference does not appear by any document; but Bri&s;&s;ot's acquittal of the charge brought again&s;t him appears in the following report of his examination, made to the French mini&s;ter, M. Breteuil, on the 5th of September.</P>
<P><Q>The Sieur Bri&s;&s;ot de Warville was conveyed to the Ba&s;tile on the day after the Sieur de Pelleport, who was arre&s;ted at Boulogne &s;ur-mer, arrived at Paris. In con&s;equence of his connections with this man, guilty of writing libels, he was &s;u&s;pected of having been his coadjutor. The atte&s;tation of a boy in the printing-office, from whence one of the&s;e libels i&s;&s;ued, gave &s;trength to &s;u&s;picions; but this atte&s;tation, tran&s;mitted from London, is de&s;|titute of authenticity; and the Sieur Bri&s;&s;ot de Warville, who has very &s;atisfactorily an&s;wered to the interrogatories which were put to him, attri|butes his crimination to the animo&s;ity of enemies whom he conceives to have plotted again&s;t him in London. The Sieur Bri&s;&s;ot de Warville is a man of talents, and of letters; he appears to have form|ed &s;y&s;tems, and to entertain extraordinary princi|ples; but it is certain that, for the la&s;t &s;even or eight months, his connections with the Sieur de Pelleport had cea&s;ed, and that he employed him|&s;elf &s;olely upon a periodical paper, which he ob|tained permi&s;&s;ion to circulate and &s;ell in France, after having &s;ubmitted it to the examination of a licen&s;er.</Q></P>
<P>It is proper to ob&s;erve, that the addition of <HI>de Warville,</HI> which Bri&s;&s;ot made to his name, (to di&s;|tingui&s;h him&s;elf from his elder brother) is a kind of local de&s;ignation, not uncommon in many countries. William of Malm&s;bury, Geoffry of Monmouth, Ra|pin de Thoyras, Joan d'Arc, &amp;c. &amp;c. But in the
<PB N="viii" REF="028343_0008_0FD8AEBDDEB89020">
orthography he &s;ub&s;tituted the Engli&s;h <HI>W</HI> for the French dipthong <HI>Ou;</HI> the &s;ound of that dipthong being &s;imilar to our W. Thus <HI>Ouarville</HI> is pro|nounced <HI>Warville</HI> in both languages.</P>
<P>In a very &s;hort time after his relea&s;e from the Ba&s;|tile, he very honourably di&s;charged his pecuniary obligation to his friend in London.</P>
<P>In the year 1787, which was the era of the foun|dation of the French revolution, the Duke de Char|tres, now become Duke of Orleans by the death of his father, embraced the party of the parliament again&s;t the Court. Upon the principle of gratitude Bri&s;&s;ot attached him&s;elf to the Duke of Orleans. As an hone&s;t man he could not do otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>We &s;hall here pa&s;s by his tour to America, and &s;ome other circum&s;tances, becau&s;e they are intimate|ly connected with the account of his writings, which is &s;ubj<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ined.</P>
<P>Upon his return to France he found that his cele|brity had not been dimini&s;hed by his ab&s;ence. He was elected a member of the Con&s;tituent A&s;&s;embly, and was much engaged in the committees of re&s;earch, of which he was the reporter. He was al&s;o elected a member of the Legi&s;lative A&s;&s;embly for the depart|ment of Paris. It mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, that the revo|lution ca&s;t a veil over the crimes of all tho&s;e who had been obliged to leave their country. In this group who returned to France was Du M&mdash;. He oppo&s;ed Bri&s;&s;ot in his election for Paris, but Bri&s;&s;ot was elected by a majority of more than three to one. However, Du M&mdash;'s party were exce&s;&s;ively morti|fied; and they uncea&s;ingly calumniated Bri&s;&s;ot in the mo&s;t opprobrious terms. M. Petion, mayor of Paris, and who was Bri&s;&s;ot's friend and town&s;man, contri|buted much to &s;trengthen his intere&s;t and a&s;cen|dency.</P>
<P>Bri&s;&s;ot now di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf as one of the <HI>Amis des Noirs</HI> (friend of the Negroes) of whom he
<PB N="ix" REF="028343_0009_0FD8AEBF9C0E8690">
was a mo&s;t zealous advocate. In a &s;peech which he delivered in the A&s;&s;embly in the year 1791, there is a &s;trong trait of philanthropy.</P>
<P>Of this &s;peech the following is a &s;hort extract: "You have heard of enormities that freeze you with horror; but Phalaris &s;poke not of his brazen bull, he lamented only the dagger that his own cruelty had rai&s;ed again&s;t him. The coloni&s;ts have related in&s;tances of ferocity; but give me, &s;aid he, an in|formed brute, and I will &s;oon make a ferocious mon|&s;ter of him. It was a white man who fir&s;t threw a negro into a burning oven; who da&s;hed out the brains of a child in the pre&s;ence of its father; who fed a &s;lave with its own proper fle&s;h. The&s;e are the mon&s;ters that have to account for the barbarity of the revolted &s;avages. Millions of Africans have pe|ri&s;hed on this &s;oil of blood. You break, at every &s;tep, the bones of the inhabitants, that nature has given to the&s;e i&s;lands: and you &s;hudder at the relation of their vengeance. In this dreadful &s;truggle the crimes of the whites are yet the mo&s;t horrible. They are the offspring of de&s;poti&s;m: whil&s;t tho&s;e of the blacks originate in the hatred of &s;lavery, and the thir&s;t of revenge. Is philo&s;ophy chargeable with the&s;e hor|rors? Does &s;he require the blood of the coloni&s;ts? Brethren, &s;he cries, be ju&s;t, be beneficent, and you will pro&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">.&mdash;Eternal &s;lavery mu&s;t be an eternal &s;ource of crimes;&mdash;dive&s;t it at lea&s;t of the epithet <HI>eternal;</HI> for angui&s;h that knows no limitation of pe|riod can only produce de&s;pair."</P>
<P>Upon the abolition of the French monarchy, in the month of September 1792, the Legi&s;lative A&s;|&s;embly di&s;&s;olved it&s;elf. The con&s;titution being di&s;|&s;olved by the abolition of the King, they conceived that it was the inherent right of the people to choo&s;e a new repre&s;entation, in order <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> new con&s;ti|tution, &s;uited to the wi&s;hes of the p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ple, and to the nece&s;&s;ity of the exi&s;ting circum&s;tances of the times.
<PB N="x" REF="028343_0010_0FD8AEC107A5D708">
In this general election Bri&s;&s;ot was elected one of the deputies from the department of Eure and Loire. His abilities and talents became every day more con|&s;picuous. He was cho&s;en the Reporter of the Com|mittee of Public Safety; in which &s;ituation he con|ducted him&s;elf without reproach, until the treache|rous conduct of Dumourier threw a &s;u&s;picion on the whole of the Gironde party.</P>
<P>Although a&s;&s;ailed on all &s;ides by his enemies, his character a&s;per&s;ed and depreciated by the ba&s;e&s;t of calumnies, Bri&s;&s;ot &s;hewed him&s;elf con&s;i&s;tent with his public principles of philanthropy.</P>
<P>In the dreadful ma&s;&s;acre of the 3d of September, his opponents, particularly Du M&mdash;, &s;ought every opportunity to accompli&s;h his de&s;truction, by ac|cu&s;ing him of being a principal in&s;tigator of tho&s;e horrors. And it mu&s;t be owned, that the&s;e repeated and continual calumnies weakened him in the pub|lic e&s;teem. Du M&mdash; was perfectly acquainted with the Engli&s;h method of writing a man down.</P>
<P>When Condorcet moved for the abolition of roy|alty, Bri&s;&s;ot was &s;ilent.</P>
<P>When the motion was made to pa&s;s &s;entence of death on the King, Bri&s;&s;ot &s;poke and voted for the appeal to the primary a&s;&s;emblies.</P>
<P>When Fayette was cen&s;ured, Bri&s;&s;ot defended him.</P>

<HEAD>Of Bri&s;&s;ot's Writings; and particularly of this Work.</HEAD>
<P>Upon the &s;ettlement of the American government after the war, he became an enthu&s;ia&s;tic admirer of the new con&s;titution of that great country. But &s;ome French per&s;ons, who had been in America, and were returned to France, had publi&s;hed their thoughts and opinions of America, in a manner that was no|thing &s;hort of illiberality. The reader will find the principal names of the&s;e writers in the thirty-&s;econd chapter of the fir&s;t volume. Bri&s;&s;ot was fired with indignation at this treatment of a people, whom he conceived could not in any wi&s;e have de&s;erved &s;uch reproach; and, imagining that the general peace in 1783, had opened an honourable and free commu|nication of reciprocal commercial advantages be|tween America and France, he wrote <HI>this volume</HI> with the view of &s;upporting and e&s;tabli&s;hing that primary idea, or <HI>theory</HI> of a French commerce with the Unit|ed States.</P>
<P>Upon this point it is no more than ordinary can|dour to ob&s;erve, that all which Bri&s;&s;ot recommends, explains, or relates, concerning a French commerce with the United States, applies equally, and in &s;ome points more than equally, to the Briti&s;h commerce with them. Every B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">iti&s;h merchant and trader may derive &s;ome advantage from a general view of the principles which he has laid down for the e&s;tabli&s;h|ment and regulation of a reciprocal commerce be|tween France and America. The produce and ma|nufactures of England are infinitely better &s;uited to the wants of America; and therefore all his theory, which is directed to the welfare and improvement of France, mu&s;t &s;trongly attach the attention of the Briti&s;h merchant and mechanic: who, in this great point, have not at pre&s;ent any &s;uperiors, but have &s;everal rivals. Bri&s;&s;ot's ambition was to make France
<PB N="xii" REF="028343_0012_0FD8AEC6255D6630">
the greate&s;t and mo&s;t powerful rival. And every candid per&s;on mu&s;t allow that he de&s;erved much cre|dit of his countrymen for the progre&s;s he made, in this fir&s;t attempt, to open the eyes of the French nation to pro&s;pects of new &s;ources of advantage. All that is further nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay of this work, is &s;aid by Bri&s;&s;ot him&s;elf in the introduction, from the tenth to the twentieth pages. In the la&s;t French edition of Bri&s;&s;ot's Travels in America, publi&s;hed by him|&s;elf, about &s;even or eight months before his decapi|tation, this volume is placed the la&s;t of that work. We have followed the Author's arrangement, and collated the whole by the la&s;t Paris edition.</P>
<P>Of the preceding volume, entitled, "New Tra|vels in the United States of America," we have no|thing to add: the whole of the French edition is now before the reader.</P>
<P>Of Bri&s;&s;ot's other works it is proper to mention the following&punc;</P>

<P>The&s;e were two di&s;cour&s;es which were crowned by the Academy of Chalons &s;ur <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, and were printed in the form of two pamphlets.

<P><PB N="xiii" REF="028343_0013_0FD8AEC8A95C1E98">This check &s;erved but as a &s;timulus to Bri&s;&s;ot to continue his &s;ubject. He therefore, in two years afterwards, publi&s;hes his <HI>Philo&s;ophical Library of the Criminal Laws.</HI> This work is now <HI>ten volumes.</HI> Bri&s;|&s;ot's view in this work was, to diffu&s;e and explain tho&s;e grand principles of freedom which produced the revolution in England in the year 1688, and the revolution in America in the year 1775. Before the di&s;&s;olution of the monarchy in France, tho&s;e princi|ples were almo&s;t unknown to the French, and are &s;till almo&s;t unknown to the other parts of Europe. But as &s;everal of the monarchs of Europe approved of the American revolution, it may be pre&s;umed that their &s;ubjects will not long continue ignorant of the motives and grounds of a mea&s;ure which was honoured with the patronage of their &s;overeigns. This circum&s;tance alone &s;hould convince the Eng|li&s;h, that many of the powers of Europe behold with plea&s;ure the diminution of their greatne&s;s and con|&s;equence, and that very few of tho&s;e powers are ever friendly to them, except during the time they are receiving a bribe, by virtue of an in&s;trument, com|monly called <HI>a &s;ub&s;idiary treaty.</HI></P>

<Q>That religious tyranny had been pro&s;trated by the blows of Voltaire, Rou&s;&s;eau, D'Alembert, and D'lderot.</Q>
His mind was capacious, and his com|prehen&s;ion exten&s;ive. In his zeal to become an imi|tator of Prie&s;tley, he publi&s;hed a volume <HI>Concerning Truth, or Thoughts on the Means of attaining Truth, in all the branches of Human Knowledge.</HI> Here was a wide field for the di&s;play of Bri&s;&s;ot's talents and indu&s;try.
<PB N="xiv" REF="028343_0014_0FD8AECCA872DBC0">
His de&s;ign was to have carried on the work to &s;eve|ral volumes, and to have invited the communica|tions of the literati of all Europe, in all the different <HI>&s;ciences,</HI> and, it may be added, <HI>&s;peculations.</HI> But there was &s;uch a freedom of &s;entiment manife&s;ted in the fir&s;t volume, that both the author and printer were alarmed with the terrors of the Ba&s;tile. Filled with the&s;e apprehen&s;ions, he left Paris, and went to Neuf|chatel. There he printed his pro&s;pectus, and he cau&s;ed it to be al&s;o printed in London. But when the&s;e copies were attempted to be circulated in France, they were &s;eized. Not a &s;ingle number was permitted to be &s;een in any book&s;eller's &s;hop in France.</P>
<P>Finding the execution of his project thus rendered impracticable, he left Neufchatel, and went to Lon|don; where, in order to give currency to his free opinions, he altered the title of his book. He pro|po&s;ed to publi&s;h the remaining part periodically, un|der the name of <HI>A De&s;cription of the Sciences and Arts in England;</HI> great part of which was intended to be devoted to an examination of, and to ob&s;ervations on, the Engli&s;h con&s;titution. His friends &s;olicited the French mini&s;try to permit this work to be re|printed at Paris. At fir&s;t they obtained this favour; and the work went on as far as twelve numbers, or two volumes; after which it was prohibited, not more to the author's mortification than to the injury of his pocket. M. de Vergennes, who was at that time mini&s;ter of France, had &s;o &s;trong a di&s;like to every thing that was Engli&s;h, that he would not en|dure the &s;malle&s;t commendation upon any part of the Engli&s;h con&s;titution, or commerce, to be pro|mulgated in France. He had begun to di&s;cover, that the favourite idea of his ma&s;ter, of &s;eparating the Briti&s;h colonies from the Briti&s;h empire, might lead to an inve&s;tigation of the principles of govern|ment

at home, and prove extremely dangerous to a de&s;potic monarchy.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding he was thus di&s;appointed a &s;e|cond time, he &s;till pur&s;ued his de&s;ign; but under a &s;econd change of title. He publi&s;hed two volumes under the title of <HI>Philo&s;ophical Letters on the Hi&s;tory of England.</HI> The title did not attract the public atten|tion; becau&s;e two volumes under a &s;imilar name had been publi&s;hed in London, and had, with &s;ome <HI>art,</HI> been impo&s;ed on the public as the production of Lord Lyttleton; but they were written by Gold|&s;mith, in &s;upport of tyranny and ari&s;tocracy.</P>
<P>Every circum&s;tance of cruelty and oppre&s;&s;ion met with the ob&s;ervation of Bri&s;&s;ot. When the late Em|peror Jo&s;eph was puni&s;hing Horiah, the leader of the revolt in Walachia, and i&s;&s;uing his &s;hocking edict again&s;t emigration, Bri&s;&s;ot addre&s;&s;ed <HI>two letters to him</HI> upon tho&s;e &s;ubjects, which were read throughout Germany. In one letter he affirmed, that Horiah was ju&s;tified in his revolt; in the other he held, that a privilege to emigrate from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ne country to another, was a &s;acred right derived from nature.</P>
<P>He was an enthu&s;ia&s;t in his admiration of the American revolution, and of the conduct of the Americans in ri&s;king every thing to emancipate them&s;elves from the tyranny of Great-Britain. Upon comparing the new con&s;titution of America with that of England, he changed his opinion of the lat|ter&mdash;<HI>he cea&s;ed to approve of it.</HI></P>
<P>Some French gentlemen, who had vi&s;ited America, having, when they returned to France, written &s;ome &s;evere remarks on the Americans, Bri&s;&s;ot defended the Americans, particularly in his book called <HI>A Cri|tical Examination of the Travels of the Marquis of Cha|telleux.</HI> But as this work has been already mentioned in the preceding volume (&s;ee chapters 31 and 32), it is not nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay any thing more of it here.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t never be forgot, that during the period of
<PB N="xvi" REF="028343_0016_0FD8AECF1DCB8870">
the French monarchy there were more intrigues al|ways going on in the French court than in any court in Europe. At this time (the year 1787) the court was full of intrigues&mdash;libidinous as well as political; for though the King had no mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, the Queen had her favourites and her party. Neckar was di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed, and Calonne was appointed by her influence. Montmorin &s;ucceeded Vergennes, and the Duke of Orleans was at the head of the party that &s;ought the overthrow of the new mini&s;try. When Calonne a&s;&s;embled the Notables at Ver&s;ailles, Bri&s;&s;ot publi&s;h|ed a pamphlet entitled <HI>No Bankruptcy; or Letters to a Creditor of the State concerning the Impo&s;&s;ibility of a Na|tional Bankruptcy, and the Means of re&s;toring Credit and Peace.</HI> This pamphlet, which contained many &s;e|vere ob&s;ervations on Calonne's mea&s;ures and plans, and &s;ome arguments in &s;upport of certain privileges claimed by the people, the Duke of Orleans was highly plea&s;ed with. He made inquiry after the author, for the tract was anonymous, and having di&s;covered him, he ordered his chancellor to provide a &s;ituation for him. He was made &s;ecretary-general of the Duke's chancery. This did not &s;ave him from mini&s;terial re&s;entment. A letter de cachet was made out again&s;t him; but having notice of it, he in&s;tantly e&s;caped to the Netherlands. He was for &s;everal months editor of the <HI>Courier Belgique,</HI> printed at Mechlin. It was during this voluntary exile that he formed his project of vi&s;iting America. He com|municated his de&s;ign to the Philanthropic Society of the Friends of the Negroes at Paris, and was by them a&s;&s;i&s;ted and recommended to &s;everal per&s;ons in America. The produce of this vi&s;it to America was the fir&s;t volume of this work, written upon his return to France. The French mini&s;try being changed before he left Europe, he embarked at Havre de Grace in the month of June, 1788.</P>
<P>Intelligence having reached him in America of
<PB N="xvii" REF="028343_0017_0FD8AED416495A50">
the rapid progre&s;s liberty was making in France, he returned to his native country in 1789, in a confi|dence that his labours might become u&s;eful to the general intere&s;t.</P>
<P>His fir&s;t publication after his return (except the preceding volume of his travels in America) was, <HI>A Plan of Conduct for the Deputies of the People.</HI></P>
<P>His knowledge and admiration of America natu|rally produced a friend&s;hip with the Marquis de la Fayette, who introduced him into the club of the Jacobins.</P>
<P>We &s;hall pa&s;s by the &s;everal &s;teps and mea&s;ures of the revolution; for to give an account of all Bri&s;|&s;ot's concern therein, would be to write a large vo|lume upon that event only. But the mention of a few circum&s;tances which are attached to Bri&s;&s;ot pe|culiarly, is indi&s;pen&s;ible.</P>
<P>By the intere&s;t, or rather influence, of Fayette, he was made a member of the Commune of Paris. He was agent of the Police, and a member of the Com|mittee of In&s;pection at Paris; and afterwards a re|pre&s;entative for the department of Eure and Loire.</P>
<P>He commenced a new&s;paper, which he called <HI>Patriote Fran&ccedil;ais</HI>; in which he con&s;tantly defended the conduct of la Fayette. He attached him&s;elf to the party called Girondi&s;ts.</P>
<P>To the Engli&s;h reader this name may require &s;ome explanation. The warm and mo&s;t violent of the National Convention, having gained the confidence and &s;upport of the city of Paris by various arts, but principally by declaring, upon every opportunity, that Paris mu&s;t con&s;tantly be the place in which the National Repre&s;entation mu&s;t hold their deliberations; to balance again&s;t this power of Paris, Condorcet, Petion, Vergniaux, Bri&s;|&s;ot, I&s;nard, and others, all members of the Conven|tion, endeavoured to gain the commercial cities in their intere&s;t. Bourdeaux was the principal of tho&s;e
<PB N="xviii" REF="028343_0018_0FD8AED547A36DD8">
cities which joined them; it is &s;ituated on the river Garonne, locally pronounced <HI>Gironde,</HI> which being the center of a department, named from the river, the appellation of Girondi&s;ts was given to the whole party.</P>
<P>The whole was a &s;truggle for power: there was no other object whatever. It is a fooli&s;h, and an idle a&s;&s;ertion, in tho&s;e who &s;ay, that Bri&s;&s;ot and the party had engaged in a plot to re&s;tore the monarchy of France. Whatever their opinions might have been in &s;ome of the early &s;tages of the revolution, perhaps from an apprehen&s;ion that the people of France might he&s;itate at an abrupt propo&s;ition of a republican go|vernment, they were unque&s;tionably innocent of the charge at the time it was made. Here follow, however, the documents as publi&s;hed by authority, in ju&s;tification of the execution, which, like all other &s;tate papers, in every country, con&s;i&s;t of the be&s;t apology, or mo&s;t colourable pretence, for a thing that has been done by order of government.</P>

<HEAD>Report again&s;t Bri&s;&s;ot, and the other arre&s;ted Deputies; made October <HI>3, 1793.</HI></HEAD>
<P>The Citizens of Paris, being informed that Amar was to pre&s;ent his report from the Committee of Ge|neral Safety this day, filled the galleries at a very early hour.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as he appeared at the bar, the applau&s;es were &s;o loud and continued, that he was unable to begin for more than a quarter of an hour.</P>
<P>At length, amid&s;t the mo&s;t profound &s;ilence, he read his report.</P>
<P>He began by &s;tating, that, before he proceeded to the report which had been expected with &s;uch im|patience, and would amply recompen&s;e the unavoid|able delay that had prevented a more &s;peedy gratifi|cation of the wi&s;hes of the people, he was com|manded
<PB N="xix" REF="028343_0019_0FD8AED6A4764638">
by the Committee of General Safety to re|que&s;t that none of the members of the Convention &s;hould be allowed to go out till the decree of accu|&s;ation had been adopted. This reque&s;t was imme|diately complied with, and a decree being pa&s;&s;ed, the Pre&s;ident gave orders to the Commander of the National Guards to allow no members to go beyond the bar.</P>
<P>Amar then affirmed that the gigantic arm of trea|&s;on had been uplifted to &s;trike the repre&s;entative maje&s;ty of the people, and to level with the ground the unity and indivi&s;ibility of the French Republic.&mdash; The arm of trea&s;on had been nerved and &s;upported by the united energies of Bri&s;&s;ot, Condorcet, Gaudet, Vergniaud, and the other Deputies.</P>
<P>Bri&s;&s;ot, the leader of this traitorous band, com|menced his political career by being a Member of the Commune of Paris, to which he was introduced by La Fayette, to who&s;e de&s;igns he had pro&s;tituted his pen. At this aera of his life he made his ap|pearance three times in the Jacobin Club. In the fir&s;t vi&s;it he propo&s;ed tho&s;e mea&s;ures which have proved &s;o di&s;a&s;trous to the Colonies; in the &s;econd, he attempted to produce the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination of the peo|ple in the Champ de Mars; and in the third vi&s;it he moved the declaration of war again&s;t Great-Britain.</P>
<P>Introduced into the Legi&s;lative A&s;&s;embly, he im|mediately entered into a coalition with Condorcet and the Girondine faction, who&s;e de&s;igns he approv|ed and &s;upported. The con&s;ummation of the ob|ject of this coalition was to have been produced by the &s;urrender of the Republican body to the viola|tion of the Allied Powers, and by the de&s;truction of that unity and indivi&s;ibility which can alone be ex|pected to combat with effect the tyrants who would undermine the proud pillar of Liberty, and de&s;troy even the ve&s;tige of freedom from the face of the earth.</P>
<P><PB N="xx" REF="028343_0020_0FD8AEDD99559880">The Court made u&s;e of their influence to declare war at a moment when the armies and the fortified places were in a &s;tate of ab&s;olute want, or entru&s;ted to traitors cho&s;en by a perjured King. They protected Narbonne, the mini&s;ter, whom all France accu&s;ed of the mea&s;ures taken to render this war fatal to liber|ty; and in their Journals they calumniated the Pa|triots who had the courage to re&s;i&s;t them. They de|fended Dietri&s;ch, convicted of being an accomplice with La Fayette, and of having offered to give up Stra&s;bourg; and while the chiefs of that faction pro|tected the con&s;pirators and traitorous Generals, the patriotic &s;oldiers were pro&s;cribed, and the volunteers of Paris &s;ent to be butchered.</P>
<P>During the time we were &s;urrounded by the &s;a|tellites of de&s;pots, when the court was going to open the gates of France to them, after having cau&s;|ed the intrepid defenders of liberty to be murdered at Paris, Bri&s;&s;ot and his accomplices did all they could to counteract the generous efforts of the peo|ple, and to &s;ave the tyrant. During and after the unhappy in&s;urrection of the 10th of Augu&s;t, they endeavoured to prevent the abdication of Louis XVI. and to pre&s;erve to him the crown.</P>
<P>In the night of the 10th of Augu&s;t, Petion&punc; &s;hut up in the Thuilleries, con&s;ulted with the &s;atellites of tyrants the plan to ma&s;&s;acre the people, and gave or|ders to Mandat, Commander of the National Guards, to let the people come in, and then to cannonade them in the rear. A few days before, Gen&s;onne and Vergniaud engaged to defend Louis XVI. on condition that the three mini&s;ters, Roland, Claviere, and Servan were recalled.</P>
<P>Petion and La Source made u&s;e of all their means to &s;end the federates from Paris. Bri&s;&s;ot, Ker&s;aint, and Rouyer, according to the letters found in the Thuilleries, gave bad advice to the tyrant, and, in defiance of the laws, they dared to &s;olicit places in

the mini&s;try, under a promi&s;e to extend the de&s;truc|tive authorities of the de&s;pot.</P>
<P>The project to overturn the foundation of the Republic, and to murder the friends of Liberty, was put in practice in the Legi&s;lative A&s;&s;embly, by Bri&s;&s;ot, in his in&s;idious harangue on the 20th of July, 1792, oppo&s;ing the abdication of the throne. We have &s;een Bri&s;&s;ot and his accomplices Republicans under Monarchy, and Royali&s;ts under the Repub|lic; always con&s;tant in their de&s;igns to ruin the French nation, and to abandon it to its enemies. At the time the hypocritical tyrant, Louis the XVI. came into the A&s;&s;embly to accu&s;e the people, who&s;e ma&s;&s;acre he had prepared,&mdash;Vergniaud, like a true accomplice of the tyrant, told him&mdash;"That the A&s;|&s;embly held it to be one of their mo&s;t &s;acred duties to maintain all con&s;tituted authorities, and con&s;e|quently that of Royalty."</P>
<P>When the Attorney-general, Raderer, came to announce, with the accent of grief, that the citi|zens in in&s;urrection had taken the re&s;olution not to &s;eparate till the A&s;&s;embly had pronounced the for|feiture of the Crown, Pre&s;ident Vergniaud &s;ilenced the applau&s;es from the gallaries by telling them, that they violated the laws in ob&s;tructing the freedom of opinion; and he told Raderer, that the A&s;&s;embly was going to take into immediate con&s;ideration the propo&s;al which he, Vergniaud, had made, &s;hewing the nece&s;&s;ity of pre&s;erving the exi&s;tence of the King.</P>
<P>Ker&s;aint &s;econded the motion. Geradet propo&s;ed to liberate Mandat, who was arre&s;ted for having given orders to fire on the people; or, in the event that that commander was no more, to &s;end a depu|tation of twelve Girondi&s;t members, authori&s;ed to choo&s;e his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, in order by this means to keep the public force at the di&s;po&s;ition of that mi&s;chievous <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">action.</P>
<P>In that memorable &s;itting of the 10th of Augu&s;t,
<PB N="xxii" REF="028343_0022_0FD8AEE3B0BB0960">
the G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ondi&s;t chiefs, Vergniaud, Guadet, and Gen|&s;onne, took by turns the chair, and went to the galleries to &s;lacken the energy of the people, and to &s;ave Royalty, under the &s;hield of the pretended con|&s;titution. They &s;poke of nothing but obedience to the con&s;titutional laws to tho&s;e citizens that came to the bar to protect their newly acquired liberty.</P>
<P>When the municipality came to invite the A&s;&s;em|bly to &s;end the <HI>proces-verbal</HI> of the great operations of the 10th of Augu&s;t, in order to prevent the calum|nies of the enemies of liberty, Guadet interrupted the members who made that demand, by making a motion to recommend anew to the magi&s;trates the execution of the laws.&mdash;He blamed the Council of the Commune for having confined Petion in his own hou&s;e; though they did it in order to render it im|po&s;&s;ible for that impo&s;tor to make even in&s;urrection &s;ub&s;ervient to act again&s;t liberty.</P>
<P>When a deputation from the &s;uburb St. Antoine came to announce the civic affliction of the widows and children ma&s;&s;acred on that day, the perfidious Guadet cooly an&s;wered them, "That the A&s;&s;embly hoped to re&s;tore public tranquillity and the reign of the laws."</P>
<P>Vergniaud, in the name of the extraordinary com|mi&s;&s;ion directed by that faction, propo&s;ed the &s;u&s;|pen&s;ion of the King, who had been dethroned by the people, as a &s;imple con&s;ervatory act of royalty; and &s;eemed greatly affected at the events which had &s;aved the country, and operated the ruin of the tyrants. He oppo&s;ed Choudieu's motion, tending to exclude from the Convention the members of both the Le|gi&s;lative and Con&s;tituent A&s;&s;emblies; and with the &s;ame cunning he prevented the regi&s;ters of the civil li&s;t from being depo&s;ited on the table.</P>
<P>Gaudet wi&s;hed to have a governor named to the &s;on of the late King, whom he called the Prince Royal. Bri&s;&s;ot and his accomplices always affected
<PB N="xxiii" REF="028343_0023_0FD8AEE4E14B1DF8">
to invoke the literal execution of the Con&s;titution, while the people, in the name of the martyrs who fell before the ca&s;tle of the Thuilleries, demanded the complete o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">erthrow of the tyrant.</P>
<P>Vergniaud oppo&s;ed this demand, &s;aying, that the people of Paris were but a &s;ection of the empire, and affected to oppo&s;e it in this manner to the de|partments.&mdash;He likewi&s;e re&s;i&s;ted the petition made by the Commons to put the tyrant under arre&s;t. He u&s;ed all his efforts with Bri&s;&s;ot, Petion, and Manuel, to get Louis XVI. confined in the Luxembourg, from whence it would have been ea&s;ier for him to e&s;cape than out of the tower of the temple.</P>
<P>Gen&s;onne and Gaudet had the &s;ervility to publi&s;h, at different times, that Louis XVI. had commanded the Swi&s;s not to fire upon the people. From that time, the leaders of the Girondi&s;ts (Department of Bour|deaux), compelled to prai&s;e the events of the 10th of Augu&s;t, continued, notwith&s;tanding, to under|mine the Republic. They publi&s;hed the &s;evere&s;t &s;atires again&s;t the Jacobins, again&s;t the Commons and people of Paris, and in general again&s;t all tho&s;e who contributed to the de&s;truction of monarchy. Roland's hou&s;e was filled with packets of libels, which were to be di&s;tributed among the people, and &s;ent into the departments.</P>
<P>The&s;e guilty men protected all the con&s;pirators, favoured the progre&s;s of Brun&s;wick with all their power, and were the agents of the Engli&s;h faction which has exerted &s;o fatal an influence during the cour&s;e of our revolution. Carra was in league with certain characters of the court of Berlin. In his Journal Politique of the 25th of Augu&s;t, 1791, he formed a wi&s;h, on account of the marriage of the Duke of York with the Prince&s;s of Pru&s;&s;ia, "that the Duke might become Grand Duke of Belgium, with all the powers of the King of the French." While Brun&s;wick was preparing to decide the fate of the
<PB N="xxiv" REF="028343_0024_0FD8AEE688D81578">
French nation by the force of arms, Carra, in the &s;ame Journal, repre&s;ented him as a great commander, the greate&s;t politician, the mo&s;t amiable Prince in Europe, formed to be the re&s;torer of liberty in all nations.&mdash;He publi&s;hed, that this Duke, on his arri|val at Paris, would go to the Jacobins, and put on the red cap, in order to intere&s;t the people in favour of this &s;atellite of tyrants. Finally, Carra was &s;o audacious as to propo&s;e openly to the Jacobins, for the Duke of York to be King of the French.</P>
<P>From the&s;e and many other facts, too tedious to mention, there re&s;ults, that Carra and his a&s;&s;ociates were iniquitous and deep di&s;&s;emblers, pen&s;ioned by England, Pru&s;&s;ia, and Holland, to enable a Prince of that family which rules over tho&s;e countries to obtain the crown of France. This &s;ame Carra, to|gether with Sillery, the di&s;honoured confidant of a contemptible Prince, was &s;ent by the then reigning faction to Dumourier, to complete that trea&s;on which &s;aved the almo&s;t ruined army of the Pru&s;&s;ian de&s;pot. Dumourier came &s;uddenly to Paris to concert with Bri&s;&s;ot, Petion, Guadet, Gen&s;onne, and Carra, the per&s;idious expedition into the Au&s;trian Netherlands, which he undertook when the Pru&s;&s;ian army, wa&s;t|ing away, by contagious di&s;orders, was peaceably re|tiring&mdash;while the French army was burning with indignation at the inaction in which they were kept.</P>
<P>It was not the fault of this faction, if the motion often made by Carra to receive Brun&s;wick at Paris, was not realized. He meditated, in the beginning of September, 1792, to deliver up this city, with|out means of defence, by flying beyond the river Loire, with the Legi&s;lative A&s;&s;embly, with the Exe|cutive Council, and with the captive King. He was &s;upported in it by Roland, Claviere, and le Brun, the creatures and in&s;truments of Bri&s;&s;ot and his a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|complices.</P>
<P>But the&s;e perfidious mini&s;ters, having been threat|ened
<PB N="xxv" REF="028343_0025_0FD8AEEB0C6E57B0">
by one of their colleagues to be denounced to the people, it was then that Carra and Sillery were &s;ent to Dumourier, to authorize this General to ne|gociate with Frederick William, to enable this Prince to get out of the kingdom, on condition that he &s;hould leave the Netherlands without the &s;ufficient means of defence, and deliver them up to the nume|rous and triumphant armies of France.</P>
<P>The calumnious harangues that were made in the Tribunes were prepared or &s;anctioned at Roland's, or in the meetings that were held at Valaze's and Pe|tion's. They propo&s;ed to &s;urround the Convention with a pretorian guard, under the name of Depart|mental Force, which was to be the ba&s;is of their foederal &s;y&s;tem. In the Legi&s;lative A&s;&s;embly they meditated a flight beyond the Loire, with the A&s;&s;em|bly, the Executive Council, the Royal Family, and the public trea&s;ure. Ker&s;aint, at his return from Se|dan, dared to propo&s;e this project to the Executive Council; and it was &s;upported by Roland, Claviere, and le Brun, the creatures and in&s;truments of Bri&s;&s;ot.</P>
<P>The faction &s;trove to put off the judgment of the tyrant by impeding the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion. They appointed a commi&s;&s;ion of twenty-four members to examine the papers found in the Thuilleres, in the guilt of which &s;ome of the&s;e members were implicated; and they endeavoured, in concert with Roland, to con|ceal tho&s;e which tended to di&s;cover their tran&s;action with the court. They voted for the appeal to the people, which would have been a germ for civil war, and afterwards wanted a re&s;pite to the judgment.</P>
<P>They ince&s;&s;antly repeated, that the Convention could do no good, and that it was not free. The&s;e declamations mi&s;led the departments, and induced them to form a coalition which was near being fatal to France.</P>
<P>They patronized an incivic peace, entitled, <HI>L'am<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> des Loix.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="xxvi" REF="028343_0026_0FD8AEEC5EA74A40">On the 14th of January, Barbaroux and his friends had given orders to the battalion of Mar&s;eillois to &s;urround the Convention.</P>
<P>On the 20th, Validi wrote to the other deputies, "To-morrow in arms to the Convention&mdash;he is a coward who does not appear there."</P>
<P>Bri&s;&s;ot, after the condemnation of Louis Capet, cen&s;ured the Convention, and threatened France with the vengeance of the European Kings. When it was his object to bring on war, he &s;poke in an op|po&s;ite &s;en&s;e, and treated the downfal of all thrones, and the conque&s;t of the univer&s;e, as the &s;port of the French nation. Being the organ of the Diplomatic Committee, compo&s;ed almo&s;t entirely of the &s;ame faction, he propo&s;ed war &s;uddenly again&s;t England, Holland, and all the powers that had not then de|clared them&s;elves.</P>
<P>This faction acted in coalition with perfidious Generals, particularly with Dumourier. Gen&s;onne held a daily corre&s;pondence with him: Petion was his friend. He avowed him&s;elf the Coun&s;ellor of the Orleans party, and had connection with Sillery and his wife.</P>
<P>After the revolt of Dumourier, Vergniaud, Gua|det, Bri&s;&s;ot, and Gen&s;onne, wi&s;hed to ju&s;tify his conduct to the Committee of General Defence, a&s;|&s;erting that the denunciations made again&s;t him by the Jacobins and the Mountain were the cau&s;e of his conduct; and that Dumourier was the protector of the <HI>&s;ound</HI> part of the Convention. This was the party of which Petion, Bri&s;&s;ot, Vergniaud, &amp;c. were the chiefs and the orators.</P>
<P>When Dumourier was declared a traitor by the Convention, Bri&s;&s;ot, in the <HI>Patriote Fran&ccedil;oi&s;e,</HI> as well as other writers, who were his accomplices, prai&s;ed him, in defiance of the law. As members of the Committee of General Defence, they ought to have given information relative to the preparations that
<PB N="xxvii" REF="028343_0027_0FD8AEF1AD888650">
were making in La Vend&eacute;e. The Convention, however, was not made acquainted with them till the war became &s;erious.</P>
<P>They armed the Sections where Ari&s;tocracy reign|ed, again&s;t tho&s;e where public &s;pirit was triumphant.</P>
<P>They affected to believe that a plot was meditated by the Republicans again&s;t the National Conven|tion, for the purpo&s;e of naming the commi&s;&s;ion of twelve, who, in an arbitrary manner, impri&s;oned the magi&s;trates of the people, and made war again&s;t the patriots.</P>
<P>I&s;nard developed the views of the con&s;piracy, when he u&s;ed this atrocious expre&s;&s;ion: "The a&s;to|ni&s;hed traveller will &s;eek on what banks of the Seine Paris once &s;tood." The Convention di&s;&s;olved the commi&s;&s;ion, which, however, re&s;umed its functions on its own authority, and continued to act.</P>
<P>The faction, by the addre&s;&s;es which it &s;ent to the departments, armed them again&s;t Paris and the Con|vention. The death of numbers of patriots in the &s;outhern departments, and particularly at Mar&s;eilles, where they peri&s;hed on the &s;caffold, was the con&s;e|quence of tho&s;e fatal divi&s;ions in the Convention, of which they were the authors.&mdash;The defection of Mar&s;eilles &s;oon produced that of Lyons. This important city became the central point of the coun|ter-revolution in the South. The republican muni|cipality was di&s;per&s;ed by the rebels, and good citi|zens were ma&s;&s;acred.&mdash;Every puni&s;hment that cruel|ty could devi&s;e to increa&s;e the torments of death was put in execution. The admini&s;trative bodies were leagued partly with Lyons, and partly with foreign Ari&s;tocrats, and with the Emigrants di&s;per&s;ed through the Swi&s;s Cantons.</P>
<P>The cabinet of London afforded life and energy to this rebellious league. Its pretext was the anar|chy that reigned at Paris&mdash;its leaders, the traitorous deputies of the Convention.</P>
<P><PB N="xxviii" REF="028343_0028_0FD8AEF3312275F0">Whil&s;t they made this powerful diver&s;ion in fa|vour of the tyrants united again&s;t us, La Vend&eacute;e continued to drink the blood of the patriots.</P>
<P>Carra and Duchatel were &s;ent to this department in quality of Deputies from the National Conven|tion.</P>
<P>Carra publicly exhorted the admini&s;trators of the Maine and Loire to &s;end troops again&s;t Paris. Both the&s;e deputies were at the &s;ame time connected with the Generals of the combined armies.</P>
<P>Cou&s;tard, &s;ent al&s;o as a commi&s;&s;ioner, carried his trea&s;onable projects to &s;uch a length, as even to fur|ni&s;h &s;upplies of provi&s;ions and &s;tores to the rebels. The mi&s;&s;ion of the agents of this faction, &s;ent to different parts of the republic, was marked by &s;ingu|lar traitorous mea&s;ures.</P>
<P>Perhaps the column of republican power would ere this have mea&s;ured its length upon the ground, if the con&s;pirators had pre&s;erved much longer their inordinate power. On the 10th of Augu&s;t, the foun|dation of the column was laid; on the 31&s;t of May it was pre&s;erved from de&s;truction. The accu&s;ed publi&s;hed a thou&s;and &s;editious addre&s;&s;es, a thou&s;and counter-revolutionary libels, &s;uch as that addre&s;&s;ed by Condorcet to the department of the Ai&s;ne. They are the di&s;graceful monuments of the trea&s;on by which they hoped to involve France in ruin.</P>
<P>Ducos and Fonfrede formed the flame of the rebel|lion, by their corre&s;pondence and their &s;peeches, in which they celebrated the virtues of the con&s;pirators.</P>
<P>Several of the&s;e con&s;pirators fled, and di&s;per&s;ed them&s;elves through the departments&mdash;They e&s;tabli&s;h|ed there a kind of National Convention, and inve&s;t|ed the admini&s;tration with independent powers&mdash; they encircled them&s;elves with guards and cannon, pillaged the public trea&s;uries, intercepted provi&s;ions that were on the road to Paris, and &s;ent them to the revolted inhabitants of the former provinces of Bri|tanny.
<PB N="xxix" REF="028343_0029_0FD8AEF4CCE9B1D0">
They levied a new army, and gave Wimp|fen, degraded by his attachment to tyranny, the command of this army.</P>
<P>They attempted to effect a junction with the re|bels of la Vend&eacute;e, and to &s;urrender to the enemy the provinces of Britanny and Normandy.</P>
<P>They deputed a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins to Paris, to murder the members of the Convention, and particularly Marat, who&s;e de&s;truction they had &s;olemnly &s;worn to ac|compli&s;h. They put a poignard into the hands of a woman who was recommended to Duperret by Bar|baroux and his accomplices. She was conveyed into the gallery of the Convention by Fauchet.&mdash;The enemies of France exalted her as a heroine. Petion pronounced her apotheo&s;is at Caen, and threw over the blood &s;tained form of a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination the &s;nowy robe of virtue.</P>
<P>Girey Dupre, the colleague of Bri&s;&s;ot, in the pub|lication of the <HI>Patriote Fran&ccedil;ais,</HI> printed at Caen &s;e|veral &s;ongs, which invited, in a formal manner, the citizens of Caen to arm them&s;elves with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oignards, for the purpo&s;e of &s;tabbing three deputies of the Convention, who were pointed out by name.</P>
<P>Bri&s;&s;ot fled with a lie added to his other crimes. Had he gone to Switzerland, as the fal&s;e pa&s;&s;port &s;tated, it would have been for the purpo&s;e of excit|ing a new enemy again&s;t France.</P>
<P>Rabaud St. Etierre, Rebecqui, Duprat, and An|tiboul, carried the torch of &s;edition into the depart|ment of le Gard and the neighbouring departments. Biroteau, Rouger, and Roland, projected their ter|rible plots in Lyons, where they poured the ample &s;tream of patriotic blood, by attaching to the friends of their country the appellation of anarchi&s;ts and monopolizers.</P>
<P>At Toulon the&s;e endeavours were &s;ucce&s;sful, and Toulon is now in the hands of the Engli&s;h. The &s;ame lot was re&s;erved for Bourdeaux and Mar&s;eilles.
<PB N="xxx" REF="028343_0030_0FD8AEF62345B578">
The reigning faction had made &s;ome overtures to Lord Hood, who&s;e fleet they expected. The entire execution of the con&s;piracy in the South waited only for the junction of the Mar&s;eille&s;e and Lyone&s;e, which was prevented by the victory gained by the Republican army which produced the reduction of Mar&s;eilles.</P>
<P>The mea&s;ures of the con&s;pirators were exactly &s;imilar to tho&s;e of the enemies of France, and par|ticularly of the Engli&s;h.&mdash;Their writings differed in nothing from tho&s;e of the Engli&s;h mini&s;ters, and li|bellers in the pay of the Engli&s;h mini&s;ters.</P>

<HEAD>INTRODUCTION,</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY J. P. BRISSOT DE WARVILLE.</BYLINE>
<P>THE Court of Great-Britain had no &s;ooner &s;igned the Treaty acknowledging the Independence of her late Colonies in North America, than her merchants and political writers &s;ought the means of rendering to her by commerce an equivalent for her lo&s;&s;es by the war.</P>
<P>Lord Sheffield has predicted, in his Ob&s;ervations on the Commerce of America, "that England would always be the &s;torehou&s;e of the United States; that the Americans, con&s;tantly attracted by the excel|lence of her manufactures, the long experienced in|tegrity of her merchants, and the length of credit, which they only can give, would &s;oon forget the wounds which the mini&s;terial de&s;poti&s;m of London, as well as the ferocity of the Engli&s;h and German &s;atellites, had given to America, to form with it new and durable connexions."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The&s;e are not Lord Sheffield's words. They are M. Bri&s;|&s;ot's; and contain HIS de&s;cription of Lord Sheffield's SUPPOSED &s;entiments, from a pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">u&s;al of that Nobleman's Ob&s;ervations on the Commerce of America. EDIT.</NOTE></P>
<P>This politician was the only one who appeared in that career; others followed it [Dr. Price, &amp;c.] and the debates, which the new regulations of com|merce propo&s;ed for America, produced in Parlia|ment, prove that the matter was known, di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, and profoundly examined.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="028343_0037_0FD8AF08F46EE5B8">The Engli&s;h nation re&s;embled at that time a man who, coming out of a long delirium (wherein he had broken every thing that he ought to have held mo&s;t dear,) eagerly &s;trives to repair the ravages of his in|&s;anity.</P>
<P>As for us, we have triumphed, and the honour of the triumph is almo&s;t the only benefit we have reap|ed. Tranquil under the &s;hade of our laurels, we &s;ee with indifference the relations of commerce which nature has created between us and the <HI>United States</HI>&punc; &mdash;whil&s;t, to u&s;e the language of vulgar policy, the Engli&s;h, of whom we are jealous as our rivals, whom we fear as our enemies, u&s;e the greate&s;t efforts to make it impo&s;&s;ible for us to form new connexions with our new friends.</P>
<P>That the Engli&s;h will &s;ucceed, there is no doubt, if our languor be not &s;oon replaced by activity; if the greate&s;t and mo&s;t generous faculties, on our part, do not &s;mooth this commerce, new, and con&s;equent|ly ea&s;y to be facilitated: finally, if our ignorance of the &s;tate of America be not &s;peedily di&s;&s;ipated by the con&s;tant &s;tudy of her re&s;ources of territory, com|merce, finance, &amp;c. and affinities they may have with tho&s;e of their own.</P>
<P>Our ignorance! This word will undoubtedly &s;hock,&mdash;for we have the pride of an ancient people: We think we know every thing,&mdash;have exhau&s;ted every thing:&mdash;Yes, we have exhau&s;ted every thing; but in what? In futile &s;ciences, in frivolous arts, in modes, in luxury, in the art of plea&s;ing women, and the relaxation of morals. We make elegant cour&s;es of chymi&s;try, charming experiments, deli|cious ver&s;es, &s;trangers at home, little informed of any thing abroad: this is what we are; that is, we know every thing <HI>except that which is proper for us to know.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This a&s;&s;ertion will perhaps appear &s;evere and fal&s;e, even to per&s;ons who think that we excel in phy&s;ics and the exact &s;ci|ences. But in granting this, is it the&s;e kinds of &s;ciences to which a man who reflects o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ght at fir&s;t to give him&s;elf up? Does not the &s;tudy of hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;ocial and civil &s;tate more nearly con|cern him? Ought not this to intere&s;t him more than the num|ber of &s;tars, or the order of chymical affinities?&mdash;It is, how|ever, the &s;cience of which we think the lea&s;t. We are pa&s;&s;ion|ately fond of poetry: we di&s;pute &s;eriou&s;ly about mu&s;ic; that is, we have a great con&s;ideration far playthings, and make a plaything of our affairs.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="028343_0038_0FD8AF0A5DDD2C10">It would be opening a va&s;t field to &s;hew what is proper for us to know, therefore I will not under|take it. I confine my&s;elf to a &s;ingle point: I &s;ay that it concerns us e&s;&s;entially to have a thorough knowledge of the &s;tate of America, and that, never|thele&s;s, we have &s;carcely begun the alphabet which leads to it. What I advance has been &s;aid before by Mr. Paine, a free American, and who has not a lit|tle contributed, by his patriotic writings, to &s;pread, &s;upport, and exalt, among his fellow countrymen, the enthu&s;ia&s;m of liberty. I will remark, &s;ays he, in his judicious letter to the Abb&eacute; Raynal, <HI>that I have not yet &s;een a de&s;cription, given in Europe, of America, of which the fidelity can be relied on.</HI></P>
<P>In France, I &s;ay it with &s;orrow, the &s;cience of commerce is almo&s;t unknown, becau&s;e its practice has long been di&s;honoured by prejudice; which pre|vents the gentry from thinking of it. This preju|dice, which is improperly thought inde&s;tructible, becau&s;e the nobility are improperly thought one of the nece&s;&s;ary elements of a monarchical con&s;titution; this would alone be capable of preventing French commerce from having activity, energy, and digni|ty, were it not to be hoped, that &s;ound philo&s;ophy, in de&s;troying it in&s;en&s;ibly, <HI>would bring men to the</HI> great idea <HI>of e&s;timating individuals by their talents, and not by their birth:</HI> without this idea there can be no great national commerce, but ari&s;tocratical men will abound; that is, men incapable of conceiving any elevated view; and men contemptible, not in a &s;tate to produce them.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="028343_0039_0FD8AF10165ACF10">Finally, another prejudice, quite as ab&s;urd, which has been combated a thou&s;and times, and is always predominant in France, withholds from the eyes of the public precious memoirs, and intere&s;ting di&s;cu&s;|&s;ions, which would inform France of her intere&s;ts.</P>
<P>Who is ignorant that it is to the freedom of de|bate and public di&s;cu&s;&s;ion that England owes the &s;in|gular pro&s;perity which, till lately, has followed her every where, in commerce, in arts, in manufactures, as well abroad as at home? a pro&s;perity which &s;he may enjoy in &s;pite of the faults of her mini&s;ters; for none but the&s;e have ever endangered it: and it is to the freedom of debate that &s;he has often owed her &s;alvation from ruin. Who doubts that this liberty would not produce the &s;ame happy effects in France; &mdash;that it would not de&s;troy fal&s;e appearances;&mdash;that it would not prevent the de&s;tructive enterprizes of per&s;onal intere&s;t;&mdash;that it would not alarm mi&s;|chievous indulgence, or the coalition of people in place with the enemies of the public welfare? Go|vernment &s;eems at pre&s;ent to do homage to this in|fluence of the freedom of di&s;cu&s;&s;ion. At length, it appears to relax of its &s;everity in the laws of the pre&s;s; it has &s;uffered &s;ome &s;hackles, which re&s;trained di&s;|cu&s;&s;ion, to be broken, e&s;pecially in political matters. But how far are we &s;till from feeling the happy ef|fects of the liberty of the pre&s;s, rather granted to pub|lic opinion, than encouraged by a real love of truth!</P>
<P>By what fatality are energetic di&s;cour&s;es of truth ineffectual? This ought to be pointed out; govern|ment it&s;elf invites us to do it; the abu&s;es which ren|der information u&s;ele&s;s in France, ought to be laid open.</P>
<P>It is becau&s;e the liberty of thinking and writing on political matters is but of recent date.</P>
<P>Becau&s;e the liberty of the pre&s;s is environed with many di&s;gu&s;ting circum&s;tances; and that an hone&s;t man who di&s;dains libels, but loves frankne&s;s, is dri|ven

<P>It is becau&s;e there are but few writers virtuous enough, &s;ufficiently organized, or in proper &s;ituations to combat and &s;urmount the&s;e ob&s;tacles.</P>
<P>Becau&s;e the&s;e writers, few in number, have but little influence; abu&s;es weakly attacked and &s;trongly defended, re&s;i&s;t every thing which is oppo&s;ed to them.</P>
<P>Becau&s;e the nece&s;&s;ity of getting works printed in foreign pre&s;&s;es, renders the publication difficult; but few of them e&s;cape from the hands of greedy hawk|ers, who monopolize the &s;ale, to &s;ell at a dearer price; who po&s;t the my&s;tery, and a fal&s;e rarity, to &s;ell dear for a longer time.</P>
<P>Becau&s;e the&s;e books are wanting in the moment

when they would excite a happy fermentation, and direct it properly, in giving true principles.</P>
<P>Becau&s;e they fall but &s;ucce&s;&s;ively into the hands of well-informed men, who are but few in number, in the &s;earch of new truths.</P>
<P>Becau&s;e the Journali&s;ts, who ought to render them a public homage, are obliged, through fear, to keep &s;ilence.</P>
<P>Becau&s;e the general ma&s;s, abandoned to the tor|rent of frivolous literature, lo&s;es the plea&s;ure of me|ditation, and with it the love of profound truths.</P>
<P>Finally, becau&s;e truth is by this fatal concurrence of circum&s;tances never &s;own in a favourable &s;oil, nor in a proper manner; that it is often &s;tifled in its birth; and if it &s;urvives all adver&s;e manoeuvres, it gathers &s;trength but &s;lowly, and with difficulty; con&s;equent|ly its effects are too circum&s;cribed for in&s;truction to become popular and national.</P>
<P>Let government remove all the&s;e ob&s;tacles: let it have the courage, or rather the found policy, to ren|der to the pre&s;s its liberty; and good works, &s;uch as are really u&s;eful, will have more &s;ucce&s;s; from which there will re&s;ult much benefit.</P>
<P>Does it wi&s;h for an example? I will quote one, which is recent and well known: the law-&s;uit of the monopolizing merchants again&s;t the coloni&s;ts of the &s;ugar i&s;lands. Would not the la&s;t have, according to cu&s;tom, been cru&s;hed, if the di&s;pute had been carried on in ob&s;curity? They had the liberty of &s;peech, of writing, and of printing; the public voice was rai&s;ed in their favour, truth was triumphant; and the wi&s;e mini&s;ter, who had permitted a public di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, that he might gain information, pro|nounced for humanity in pronouncing in their fa|vour.</P>
<P>Let us hope that this example will be followed; that government will more and more perceive the immen&s;e advantages which re&s;ult from the liberty of
<PB N="7" REF="028343_0042_0FD8AF15CF1B9D60">
the pre&s;s. There is one which, above all others, ought to induce it to accelerate this liberty, becau&s;e it nearly regards the intere&s;t of the pre&s;ent moment: this liberty is a powerful means to e&s;tabli&s;h, fortify, and maintain public credit, which is become, more than ever, nece&s;&s;ary to great nations, &s;ince they have &s;tood in need of loans. As long as the attempts of per&s;onal intere&s;t are feared by the ob&s;curity which covers them, public credit is never firmly e&s;tabli&s;h|ed, nor does it ri&s;e to its true height. It is no longer calculated upon the intrin&s;ic &s;trength of its re&s;ources, but upon the probability, upon the fear of the di&s;|order, which may either divert them from their real employ, or render them &s;terile. The liberty of the pre&s;s keeps per&s;onal intere&s;t too much in awe not to fetter its mea&s;ures; and then public credit &s;upports it&s;elf if it be e&s;tabli&s;hed, is formed if it be &s;till to be con&s;tituted, and fortifies it&s;elf if it has been weaken|ed by error.</P>
<P>Full of the&s;e ideas, as well as the love of my coun|try, and &s;urmounting the ob&s;tacles to the liberty of printing, I have undertaken to throw &s;ome light upon our commercial affinities with the United States. This object is of the greate&s;t importance; the que&s;tion is, to develope the immen&s;e advantages which France may reap from the revolution which &s;he has &s;o powerfully favoured, and to indicate the means of extending and con&s;olidating them.</P>
<P>It appears to me that all the importance of this re|volution has not been perceived; that it has not been &s;ufficiently con&s;idered by men of under&s;tanding. Let it, therefore, be permitted me to con&s;ider it at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>I will not go into a detail of the advantages which the United States mu&s;t reap from the revolution, which a&s;&s;ures them liberty. I will not &s;peak of that regeneration of the phy&s;ical and moral man, which mu&s;t be an infallible con&s;equence of their con&s;titu|tions;

of that perfection to which free America, left to its energy, without other bounds but its own fa|culties, mu&s;t one day carry the arts and &s;ciences, America enjoys already the right of free debate, and it cannot be too often repeated, that without this de|bate, perfection is but a mere chimera. In truth, almo&s;t every thing is yet to be done in the United States, but almo&s;t every thing is there under&s;tood: the general good is the common end of every indi|vidual,&mdash;this end cheri&s;hed, implanted, &s;o to &s;peak, by the con&s;titution in every heart.

There are two which are particularly &s;triking: the fir&s;t, and greate&s;t of the revolution, at lea&s;t in the eyes of philo&s;ophy, is that of its &s;alutary influence on human knowledge, and on the reform of local prejudices; for this war has occa&s;ioned di&s;cu&s;&s;ions important to public happi|ne&s;s,&mdash;the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the &s;ocial compact,&mdash;of civil liberty,&mdash;of the means which can render a peo|ple independent, of the circum&s;tances which give &s;anction to its in&s;urrection, and make it legal,&mdash;and which give this people a place among the powers of the earth.</P>
<P>What good has not re&s;ulted from the repeated de|&s;cription of the Engli&s;h con&s;titution, and of its ef|fects? What good has not re&s;ulted from the codes of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts and New-York, publi&s;hed and &s;pread every where? And what benefits will they &s;till produce?

<P>This revolution, favourable to the people, which is preparing in the cabinets of Europe, will be un|doubtedly accelerated, by that which its commerce will experience, and which we owe to the enfran|chi&s;ement of America. The war which procured it to her, has made known the influence of commerce on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ower, the nece&s;&s;ity of public credit, and con&s;e|quently of public virtue, without which it cannot long &s;ub&s;i&s;t:&mdash;What rai&s;ed the Engli&s;h to that height of power, from whence, in &s;pite of the faults of their Mini&s;ters, Generals, and Negociators, they braved, for &s;o many years, the force of the mo&s;t powerful nations? Their commerce, and their credit; which, loaded as they were with an enormous debt, put them in a &s;tate to u&s;e all the efforts which nations, the mo&s;t rich by their &s;oil and population, could not have done in a like ca&s;e.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the advantages which France, the world, and humanity, owe to the American Revolution; and when we con&s;ider them, and add tho&s;e we are obliged to let remain in ob&s;curity, we are far from regretting the expences they occa&s;ioned us.</P>
<P>Were any thing to be regretted, ought not it to vani&s;h at the appearance of the new and immen&s;e commerce which this revolution opens to the French? This is the mo&s;t important point at pre&s;ent for us,&mdash; that on which we have the lea&s;t information, which con&s;equently makes it more nece&s;&s;ary to gain all we can upon the &s;ubject; and &s;uch is the object of this work.</P>

This part does too much honour to my friend, not to confine my&s;elf to de&s;cribe him in this character, the only one which has ever been productive of public good.</P>
<P>M. Claviere has, during his abode in France, given proofs of his knowledge in the philo&s;ophical and political part of commerce. It is to his abode among us that the public is indebted for &s;ome u&s;eful works on the&s;e ab&s;tract matters; works, as remark|able for their &s;olidity of principle and truth of di&s;|cu&s;&s;ion, as for the clearne&s;s and preci&s;ion of ideas; works, who&s;e &s;ucce&s;s proves that minds may be led to the contemplation of the&s;e matters, by &s;ub&s;titut|ing an exact and clear analy&s;is to the metaphy&s;ical and ob&s;cure jargon which re&s;trained them from it.</P>

<P>We have joined the information of intelligent per|&s;ons, who&s;e abode in America has given them an opportunity of gaining information, to that with which the public papers, the acts of Congre&s;s, of different legi&s;latures, and the different works pub|li&s;hed in the United States, have furni&s;hed us.

<P>We have in the&s;e notes indicated, as often as it has been po&s;&s;ible, the ideas of reform which may be u&s;eful to France. We have frequently quoted the Engli&s;h nation and government.

<P>Notwith&s;tanding the numerous precautions we have taken to come at truth; notwith&s;tanding the extreme attention we have given to this work, errors will undoubtedly be &s;ound in &s;ome of the &s;tatements, and perhaps in the rea&s;onings.

<HEAD>CHAPTER I. Of External Commerce; the circum&s;tances which lead to it, and the Means of a&s;&s;uring it to a Nation.</HEAD>
<P>COMMERCE &s;ignifies an exchange of produc|tions, either by barter, or by repre&s;entative &s;igns of their value.</P>
<P>External commerce is that carried on between two or more nations. It &s;uppo&s;es in them mutual wants, and a &s;urplus of productions corre&s;pondent thereto.</P>
<P>Nations, which nature or the force of things in|vites to a commercial intercour&s;e, are tho&s;e which have that corre&s;pond<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nce of wants, and &s;urplus of productions.</P>
<P>This familiarity enables them to trade together, directly or indirectly; a direct commerce is that which exi&s;ts between two nations, without the intervention of a third.</P>
<P>Commerce is indirect when one nation trades with another by way of a third. This is the ca&s;e of &s;tates which have no &s;ea-ports, and yet wi&s;h to exchange their productions for tho&s;e of the Indies.</P>
<P>That nation, which having it in its power to carry on a direct commerce with another, yet makes u&s;e of an intermediate one, is nece&s;&s;arily obliged to di|vide
<PB N="18" REF="028343_0052_0FD8AF33190A8D90">
its profits. However, this di&s;advantage may &s;ometimes be compen&s;ated by other con&s;iderations.</P>
<P>Such, for in&s;tance, is the ca&s;e of a nation which, in want of hu&s;bandmen and manufacturers, prefers that &s;trangers &s;hould them&s;elves come in &s;earch of its &s;uperfluities, and bring in exchange tho&s;e of others: its want of population impo&s;es this law, and whil&s;t the&s;e con&s;iderations exi&s;t, it is both morally and phy|&s;ically better that its inhabitants &s;hould be employed in cultivation, than become carriers of their own national productions, or of tho&s;e of others.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible that nations which already have communications with each other, &s;hould be ignorant of their mutual productions. Hence ari&s;es the de&s;ire of acquiring them in tho&s;e where they do not exi&s;t. Hence direct or indirect commerce, which is con&s;e|quently the inevitable re&s;ult of the &s;tate of things.</P>
<P>From the &s;ame principle, it is the intere&s;t of each nation to render its exterior commerce direct as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, without doing an injury to its interior trade.</P>
<P>Direct importations, not being &s;ubject to the ex|pences and commi&s;&s;ions of agents, procure things at a cheaper rate.</P>
<P>A moderate price is the &s;ure&s;t means of obtaining an exterior commerce, the be&s;t rea&s;on for preference, and the guarantee of its continuation.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>It is vulgarly &s;aid that a thing is dear when once it is above the accu&s;tomed price; and it is e&s;teemed cheap the moment that price is dimini&s;hed.</P>
<P>By this it &s;eems that the dearne&s;s of a thing is the compari|&s;on of its &s;tated, with its u&s;ual price. The la&s;t is determined by five principal circum&s;tances. 1&s;t. The co&s;t of the raw ma|teral. 2d. That of the workman&s;hip. 3d. The want the con|&s;umer has of the thing. 4th. The means he has of paying for it. 5th. The proportion of its quantity with the demand there is for it. The&s;e circum&s;tances increa&s;e or dimini&s;h the profit of the &s;eller; &s;ometimes indeed they may prevent him from gain|ing at all. Circum&s;tances which influence the mo&s;t are &s;carcity and abundance, expre&s;&s;ions by which the proportion between the want and the quantity of productions are de&s;ignated.</P>
<P>If there be a &s;urplus of them, they are naturally &s;old at a low price. Whence it appears, that nations having great quantities of raw materials, various manufactures and a numerous popu|lation, are more particularly invited to an exterior and continued commerce, becau&s;e they have it in their power to carry it on upon better terms.</P>
<P>An article may be &s;old at a low price, and enrich him who furni&s;hes it; as it may be &s;old dear, and ruin the &s;eller. This depends upon the relation there is between its value and the means of its productions. Every nation di&s;po&s;ed to exterior commerce, in what&s;oever article it may be, ought therefore to con&s;ider two things, the price at which it can afford &s;uch an ar|ticle, and that at which it is &s;old by rival nations: if it cannot equal the la&s;t, it ought to abandon that part of its trade.</P></NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="028343_0053_0FD8AF3482675758">The country which can produce and &s;ell a thing at the cheape&s;t rate, is that which unites the favour|able advantages of that production, whether it be with re&s;pect to its quality, manufacture, or its low rate of carriage.</P>
<P>The advantages which render commodities and raw materials cheap, are a fertile &s;oil, ea&s;y of culti|vation, climate favourable to the production, a go|vernment which encourages indu&s;try, and facili|tates carriage by the con&s;truction of public roads and navigable canals; finally, a population not too nu|merous relative to the extent of country which of|fers it&s;elf to be cultivated.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The &s;ituation of the United States proves the la&s;t a&s;&s;ertion, which may at fir&s;t &s;ight appear paradoxical; things are cheap there, becau&s;e population is not in proportion to the extent of lands to be cultivated. In a good &s;oil, a man may, by his la|bour, ea&s;ily &s;upply the con&s;umption of ten men, or even more. The&s;e ten men may therefore be employed for exterior con&s;ump|tion.</NOTE></P>
<P>The &s;ame circum&s;tances are &s;till more favourable to the manufacture of things common, &s;imple, or little charged with fa&s;hion, if the raw material be a natural production of the country, in plenty, and ea&s;y to be worked up; becau&s;e the&s;e manufactures require but few hands, or are carried on at that lei|&s;ure
<PB N="20" REF="028343_0054_0FD8AF35DDB1CE80">
which agriculture affords. Nothing can equal the cheapne&s;s of this workman&s;hip, and in general no indu&s;try is more lucrative, or better &s;upported on ea&s;y terms, than that which is employed in the in|tervals of repo&s;e from cultivation: in that ca&s;e cheap|ne&s;s is neither the product nor the &s;ign of mi&s;ery in the manufacturer; it is, on the contrary, the proof and con&s;equence of his ea&s;y circum&s;tances.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Switzerland, and certain parts of Germany, offer a &s;triking example of this fact. Merchandi&s;e is fabricated there, at a lower rate than in any other country of Europe, by means of this employment of lei&s;ure hours, and is capable of being tran&s;|ported to di&s;tant countries, without lo&s;ing its original advantage; even acro&s;s great &s;tates, where nature, left to her own energy, would be &s;till more favourable to the &s;ame manufactures.</NOTE></P>
<P>The mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary conditions for manufacturing, at a cheap rate, articles complicated, or extremely fine and perfect, or which require the union of &s;eve|ral kinds of workman&s;hip, are a con&s;tant and a&s;&s;idu|ous application, and a numerous population; one half of which mu&s;t be at a di&s;tance from the labours of the field, and applied to manufacture alone.</P>
<P>The&s;e manufactures ought, according to natural order, to be the productions of an exce&s;s of popula|tion only, which cannot give its indu&s;try to agricul|ture or &s;imple manufactures; but in general they are the re&s;ult of the gathering together of the poor and wretched in great cities.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>The&s;e manufactures are crouded with individuals, who having no property, or hope of con&s;tant employ in the country, or who are induced by the allurements of gain and luxury, run into cities, and &s;oon become obliged to &s;ell their indu&s;try at a mean price, proportioned to the number of tho&s;e who are in want of employ. When cheapne&s;s of workman&s;hip comes from this afflicting concurrence of the want of money in men without employ, it is not a &s;ign of pro&s;perity. On the contrary, it is the re&s;ult and proof of a bad &s;ocial organization, of too unequal a divi&s;ion of property, and con&s;equently of an unju&s;t di&s;tribution of nece&s;&s;ary employments, which compels indu&s;try to change, from the fabrication of what is nece&s;&s;ary and u&s;eful, to that which is fanta&s;tic, forced, and pernicious. Hence it follows, that wretchedne&s;s in any country is in proportion to this cheap|ne&s;s of workman&s;hip.</P>
<P>It is equally evident from the&s;e rea&s;onings, that new and well con&s;tituted &s;tates ought not to de&s;ire manufactures produced by things &s;o badly arranged: they ought not to be anxious about them till the rate of population and exce&s;s of u&s;eful labour na|turally incline indu&s;try to apply it&s;elf to improve and carry them on. The&s;e rea&s;onings again&s;t low priced workman&s;hip do not hinder us from agreeing, that there is a real advantage in the means of exterior commerce; and that in the actu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> &s;tate of things manufacturing and commercial nations may perhaps be obliged to &s;eek for it, although it does not compen&s;ate the interior evil by which it is produced.</P></NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="028343_0055_0FD8AF3A1ECA8D98">The&s;e manufactures cannot furni&s;h their produc|tions but with difficulty and uncertainty for exterior commerce, when they are e&s;tabli&s;hed and &s;upported merely by forced means, &s;uch as prohibitions, ex|clu&s;ive privileges, &amp;c. by which natural ob&s;tacles, not to be de&s;troyed, are pretended to be combated. Countries exempt from them prevail in the end, and obtain a preference.</P>
<P>It &s;ometimes happens, that ob&s;tacles cau&s;ed to manufactures by dearne&s;s of provi&s;ions, burthen&s;ome impo&s;ts, di&s;tance from the raw material, and un|&s;kilfulne&s;s, or &s;mall number of hands, are &s;urmounted by ingenuity, or the u&s;e of machines; which make the work of one man equal to that of many; and render a manufacture capable of &s;upporting the com|merce of populous countries, where &s;uch manoeu|vres and machines are not made u&s;e of, or known.</P>
<P>But the&s;e means are precarious, and &s;ooner or later give way to a more happy &s;ituation, where climate, &s;oil, and government e&s;pecially, concur in favouring, without effort, all the activity and indu&s;try of which men are &s;u&s;ceptible.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">FAVOURING, in political economy &s;ignifies, for the mo&s;t part, not to &s;hackle indu&s;try with too many regulations; how|ever favourable certain of the&s;e may be, they re&s;train it in &s;ome re&s;pect or other. Trade is never better encouraged than when left to it&s;elf.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="028343_0056_0FD8AF3B41AE9678">Thus, in the final analy&s;is, the power of furni&s;h|ing at a low price belongs inconte&s;tably to countries &s;o favoured, and they will obtain in all markets a &s;ure preference to tho&s;e to which nature has been le&s;s kind, let their indu&s;try be ever &s;o great, becau&s;e the &s;ame indu&s;try may always be added to natural advantages.</P>
<P>Exterior commerce, more than any other, is in|timidated by &s;hackles, cu&s;toms, vi&s;its, chicaneries, and proce&s;&s;es; by the manner of deciding them, and the &s;olicitations and delays they bring on.</P>
<P>The &s;tate which would favour &s;uch a commerce &s;hould, in the fir&s;t place, de&s;troy all the&s;e ob&s;tacles. It is more to its intere&s;t &s;o to do, as from exterior commerce re&s;ults an augmentation of the national revenue.</P>
<P>All things equal, relative to the price of merchan|di&s;e, and to the facilities with which direct exterior commerce can be carried on, it is more readily e&s;ta|bli&s;hed between two nations which have a &s;imilarity of political and religious principles,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Religious con&s;iderations had formerly a con&s;iderable in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">|ence on civilized men, and on commerce.

Commercial people gene|rally place profit at the head of every thing.</P>
<P>Nations not having the&s;e affinities between them, ought, in order to compen&s;ate for their deficiency, to give great encouragements, and tolerate to the

utmo&s;t degree the religious and political opinions of &s;trangers, as well as their manners and cu&s;toms.</P>
<P>To obtain the preference in exterior commerce, neither treaties, regulations, nor force mu&s;t be de|pended upon. Force has but a momentary effect. It de&s;troys even that which it means to protect Treaties and regulations are u&s;ele&s;s if the intere&s;ts of two nations do not invite them to a mutual in|tercour&s;e. They are ineffectual if that attraction does not exi&s;t. Treaties, regulations, force, all yield to the impul&s;e or nature of things.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">FORCE OF THINGS. The political law which governs all, in politics as in phy&s;ics. There is a general force who&s;e action is manife&s;t, which, in &s;pite of wars, treaties, and the manoeu|vres of cabinets, governs all events, and carries away men and nations in its cour&s;e. It is this force of things which overturn|ed the Roman empire, when it &s;tood upon a ba&s;is di&s;proportioned to its ma&s;s; which in the 14th century took from the Engli&s;h one half of France, and in the 18th, has taken from them half of the new world&mdash;which delivered Holland from the yoke of Spain, and Sweden from that of Denmark. It is this force which de&s;troyed the projects of &s;uch conqu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">s as Charlemagne, Zengi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, and Nadir. They ran from place to place; they de|&s;troyed mankind to build empires. The&s;e empires died with them. This force acts upon commerce as upon revolutions. It is that which, by the di&s;covery of the Cape of Good Hope, be|reaved the Venetians of their trade to the Indies, and made it pa&s;s over &s;ucce&s;&s;ively to the Portugue&s;e, the Dutch, the Engli&s;h, and the French. Finally, it is the force of things which will decide the great que&s;tion of the commerce of America.</NOTE></P>
<P>This force of things in commerce is but the re&s;ult of the circum&s;tances in which two nations are which attract one towards the other, and oblige them to enter into an alliance, rather than with any other nation.

<HEAD>CHAPTER II. Of External Commerce, con&s;idered in its Means of Ex|change, and its Balance.</HEAD>
<P>WE are deceived in believing that commerce cannot be e&s;tabli&s;hed between two nations without gold or &s;ilver to balance their accounts. It will be intere&s;ting to enter into &s;ome detail on this head, on account of the deficiency of coin in the United States, and the nece&s;&s;ity of reducing them&s;elves to the com|merce of exchange, being the two principal objec|tions ignorantly brought again&s;t a trade with them.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The &s;carcity of money in the United States of America has been greatly exaggerated in France. It mu&s;t be &s;carce in all new &s;tates, where nothing &s;hackles indu&s;try, where &s;o many things are to be created, and where, in every quarter, there are &s;uch quantities of lands to be cleared. In order that money &s;hould be plenty in this &s;tate of creation, mines would be nece&s;|&s;ary; and at the &s;ame time a want of hands, and indu&s;try clogged with impediments, circum&s;tances much more unfavourable to foreign commerce than the &s;carcity of money in an active and indu&s;trious country. One fact &s;eems to prove to us, that in in|dependent America money is found in the mo&s;t de&s;irable pro|portion to population, at lea&s;t by taking Europe for the term of compari&s;on. Contracts e&s;teemed good, and of which the in|tere&s;t is regularly paid, are &s;old there at the rate of &s;ix percent. per annum. Yet the clearing of lands mu&s;t produce a much greater benefit; why then is not all the money &s;wallowed up? why remains there enough of it to fulfil the&s;e contracts, which pro|duce no more than five or &s;ix per cent? Is it not becau&s;e money is not &s;o &s;carce there as people in France imagine, where the actual &s;tate of the Americans is confounded with the di&s;tre&s;s in which they were when they combated for their liberty?</NOTE></P>
<P>It has been frequently a&s;&s;erted that the balance will be again&s;t them; that they can only offer an exchange in merchandi&s;e. It is therefore nece&s;&s;ary to prove that this great word, balance, is in&s;ignificant; that
<PB N="25" REF="028343_0059_0FD8AF42A1C7B098">
a great commerce may be carried on without money, and that one of exchange is the mo&s;t advantageous of any.</P>
<P>When a nation pays with money the whole, or the balance of its importations, it is &s;aid the balance of trade is again&s;t it, by which a di&s;advantageous idea of its po&s;ition is meant to be given. This is a pre|judice ea&s;y to be overturned, although entertained by men celebrated for their knowledge.</P>
<P>In effect, whence comes to this country the gold it pays? It is either from its mines, and in that ca&s;e it pays with one of its own productions; or it owes it to artificers who exerci&s;e their functions in a fo|reign country, and even then it pays with a produc|tion which originates within its dominions. As long as a nation pays another, directly or indirectly, with its own productions, its po&s;ition cannot be di&s;ad|vantageous. Therefore, the unfavourable word ba|lance, thus attached to the balance of an account paid in money, offers no exact and nice idea of the favourable or unfavourable &s;tate of a nation.</P>
<P>Gold is al&s;o a merchandi&s;e; and it may be con|venient to one nation, according to its relations or connexions with another, to pay with money, with|out its having, for that rea&s;on, an unfavourable ba|lance again&s;t it.</P>
<P>There is but one ca&s;e wherein the balance again&s;t a nation can be declared; it is that when having ex|hau&s;ted its money and trea&s;ures, it remains debtor to another nation. But things could not remain long in this &s;tate; &s;o wretched a &s;oil, unequal to the con|&s;umption and exchange of its inhabitants, would &s;oon be abandoned; this, however, cannot happen. Importation pre&s;ently becomes in proportion to ex|portation; an equilibrium is e&s;tabli&s;hed, and the pre|tended unfavourable balance has not duration enough to give a right of &s;uppo&s;ing even its exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>There is as little truth and ju&s;tice in &s;aying a na|tion
<PB N="26" REF="028343_0060_0FD8AF444AF99DB8">
has the balance of trade in its favour, when it receives in money balances due to it upon the amount of its exportations. This balance, exi&s;ting for a certain time, would heap up &s;pecie in the country, and at length render it very mi&s;erable. This has never been the ca&s;e; yet it would have happened if this &s;y&s;tem had the lea&s;t foundation.</P>
<P>The circulation of money depends on too many cau&s;es, to deduce from its abundance a certain &s;ign of a favourable commercial balance; a thou&s;and combinations and events, which have no relation to that balance, draw money from abroad or &s;end it there; and in general, continued and various motions of commerce, the tables of exportation and impor|tation, according to which the &s;ign of a favourable or unfavourable balance is regulated, are too uncer|tain and defective for the purpo&s;e, as well as for form|ing a judgment of the quantities of coin or riches of a nation.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>I will give a &s;triking example of the deficiency of the&s;e calculations, of the e&s;timation of a balance of trade, and of the quantity of money. This example will prove that political cal|culators neglect, or are ignorant of foreign events which over|turn their calculations.</P>
<P>M. Neckar wi&s;hed to inform him&s;elf (Chap. IX. Vol. 3d, of his Treati&s;e on the Admini&s;tration of Finance) what was the &s;um b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ought to and pre&s;erved in Europe from 1763 to 1777.

<P>It will only be nece&s;&s;ary to quote two or three authenticated facts, to prove the in&s;ufficiency of this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters">lation founded upon the regi&s;ters of Cu&s;tom-hou&s;es.</P>
<P>In &s;tating the &s;um of money entered into Europe, it does not appear that M. Neckar takes account of the gold and &s;il|ver, which the conque&s;t and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ngal by the Eng|li&s;h, and their e&s;tabli&s;hments in the Ea&s;t-Indies, have cau&s;ed to pa&s;s into this q<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">arter of the world. But according to the calculation of the &s;ecret committee, appointed by the Parlia|ment of England, to examine the &s;tate of Engli&s;h po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in India, the &s;ums drawn from Bengal from 1757 to 1771, amount to 751,500,000 livres.<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">The detail of this calculation is given in The De&s;crip|tion of the Indies, Vol. I. page 249. It is nece&s;&s;ary to take notice here of an error crept into that work, which is, that the &s;um total is there given in pounds &s;terling, in&s;tead of livres tour|nois.</NOTE> To what will it amount, if there be added to it tho&s;e drawn from the Carnatic and from Oude, of which Nabobs have the &s;hadow only of the property, from the revenue of the Northern Circars, from the theft com|mitted on the Emperor of Mogul, from 1771 to the pre&s;ent day, of his twenty-&s;ix millions, from the perpetual increa&s;e of ter|ritories and revenues, from the &s;ale made in 1773 of the Rohil|las to the Nabob of Oude, which produced to the Engli&s;h up|wards of fifty millions?<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">See Mackinto&s;h's Voyage to the Ea&s;t Indies, Vol. I. page 340.</NOTE></P>
<P>Finally, what will be the amount, if there be added to it the enormous &s;ums exported from the Indies by individuals, who have there enriched them&s;elves? The fortune of Lord Clive was beyond calculation; that of Mr. Ha&s;tings, again&s;t whom a pro&s;ecution is now carrying on, is calculated at thirty or for|ty millions. Another Governor has, according to &s;everal well-founded reports, recently paid upwards of two millions of livres to &s;ilence his accu&s;ers. It is true that a part of the&s;e immen&s;e riches have been employed to defray the expences incurred by the Engli&s;h in guarding their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in India; that a more con&s;iderable one has been &s;ent into Europe under the form of merchandize; but it cannot be denied that a third part has been brought in gold and &s;ilver to our continent.

Each individual, as &s;oon as he is charged with the &s;upport of him&s;elf and family, mu&s;t have at lea&s;t &s;ome pieces of money for daily exigencies, and the payment of impo&s;ts.

It is impo&s;&s;ible to calculate this fir&s;t part.&mdash; It is however evident, that it ought to be in proportion to the population, and to increa&s;e with it; and that a decrea&s;e of population would &s;oon take place, were many individuals total|ly deprived of a pecuniary contingency &s;ufficient to procure them &s;uch nece&s;&s;aries as cannot be di&s;pen&s;ed with, and which they neither make nor receive them&s;elves. It appears al&s;o, that this part of the coin remains in the country by rea&s;on of its con|tinued application in little &s;ums to daily wants, and of the ab|&s;olute &s;tagnation of that which is laid up in re&s;erve.</P>
<P>The &s;econd part is de&s;tined, under the &s;ame form, to the great operations of commerce. It is equally impo&s;&s;ible to fix its quantity, on account of an infinity of combinations which continually change and cau&s;e the&s;e metals to pa&s;s from one country to another. Daily charges, cu&s;toms, &amp;c. retain a part; but the&s;e objects belong equally to our fir&s;t divi&s;ion.</P>
<P>The third part contains uncoined gold and &s;ilver, under what|ever form they may have: it is, like the &s;econd, &s;ubject to numbers of continual variations, which leave no &s;atisfactory means of determining its quantity.</P>
<P>To pretend to a&s;certain the quantity in the ma&s;s, by pay|ments of uncertain commercial balances, and by the addition of &s;pecie produced from mints &s;ince a new coinage has taken place, is not a more certain means, becau&s;e it would be equal|ly nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve the continual action of commerce upon the&s;e metals, under all their forms, and of the combinations it produces, which &s;ucce&s;&s;ively ari&s;e from one another. In thus e&s;timating money it is forgotten, that it is an univer&s;al agent, which, by that character alone, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily change its &s;ituation perpetually; &s;ince commerce has produced an af|finity among men, by wants, which they have created to them|&s;elves, of their reciprocal productions. It is equally unob|&s;erved, that different circum&s;tances reduce gold to the &s;tate of an ingot; that con&s;equently the &s;ame piece may pa&s;s &s;everal times under the die in the cour&s;e of a certain number of years. This is a reflection which M. Neckar &s;eems not to have made when he &s;tated the money exi&s;ting in France at &s;o con&s;iderable a &s;um. It will be known when the recoinage of the old Louis is fini&s;hed, what we ought to think of his calculations. But the &s;um is far &s;hort of 957 millions, as e&s;timated by that mi|ni&s;ter. It is more than probable, that it will never amount to more than two thirds of it.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER III. Application of the foregoing general Principles to the recipro|cal Commerce of France and the United States.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>That France has every Means of procuring a great Commerce, and tho&s;e which mu&s;t a&s;&s;ure it to her in the United States; that her Productions are proper for them; and that her parti|cular interior Circum&s;tances oblige her to engage in this Commerce.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THESE truths will not be conte&s;ted when the fer|tility of the &s;oil of France &s;hall be con&s;idered, her various and particular productions, and the tempe|rature of her climate, which favours tho&s;e the mo&s;t &s;imple and nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>The&s;e advantages con&s;tantly a&s;&s;ure her workman|&s;hip at a lower price than tho&s;e of nations endowed with the &s;ame activity, but which have not the ad|vantages of &s;uch favourable circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>Her manufactures are numerous, and her popu|lation is con&s;iderable in compari&s;on with that of mo&s;t other nations. Yet the&s;e are far from the degree to which they may be extended; for in con&s;idering France, room for a more exten&s;ive population is &s;oon di&s;covered, and an immen&s;ity of means for a great number of manufactures, which only wait for the will of government to be e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>
<P>What other nation has more activity? more in|du&s;try? or unites to &s;o great a degree, all the advanta|ges of civilization, and the matter and means of the mo&s;t varied and exten&s;ive interior and exterior com|merce, independent of completion? What other
<PB N="39" REF="028343_0073_0FD8AF63308E1D60">
would have been able to re&s;i&s;t, for &s;o long a time, the chain of misfortunes, and repeated faults of which &s;he has been the victim? The force of her con&s;titution, rather than her apparent pro&s;perity, ought to be calculated by this re&s;i&s;tance. France is not what &s;he might and ought to be. There is no doubt but &s;he will become &s;o if &s;he opens her eyes to her true intere&s;ts, if, un&s;hackling her interior, &s;he does not neglect her exterior commerce, and parti|cularly that which the United States wi&s;h to open with her. The productions of her &s;oil and indu&s;try are proper for them. She can export in exchange, from independent America, the raw materials for which &s;he may have occa&s;ion. The&s;e two countries may therefore carry on a <HI>direct</HI> commerce of <HI>ex|change</HI> between them, and &s;o much the more advan|tageous, as the raw materials, which mu&s;t con&s;titute it, would co&s;t them more in any other place. The&s;e truths will not be doubted when the double cata|logue of the re&s;pective wants of France and the United States, or of their importation and exporta|tion, &s;hall have been examined.</P>
<P>Intelligent patriots are of opinion, that it cannot be advantageous to France, in her pre&s;ent &s;ituation, to engage in the commerce of the United States.&mdash; They ob&s;erve, that her manufactures being inferior to tho&s;e of the Engli&s;h, &s;he will be wor&s;ted in the American markets; they add, that in&s;tead of en|couraging this commerce, government would per|haps act more wi&s;ely by preventing the interior abu|&s;es which &s;top the progre&s;s of cultivation and in|du&s;try.</P>
<P>I am far from denying the nece&s;&s;ity there may be of &s;tirring to reform &s;uch abu&s;es, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d to direct our efforts to culture and the improvement of manufac|tures; but it is ea&s;y to demon&s;trate, that exterior commerce will in a very &s;hort time infallibly bring
<PB N="40" REF="028343_0074_0FD8AF6463A42540">
on &s;uch a reform, and that France in her pre&s;ent &s;tate is in the greate&s;t need of this exterior trade.</P>
<P>In effect, an active and indu&s;trious nation, who&s;e &s;oil is fertile, ought always to have markets for the &s;ale of its commodities to animate its indu&s;try. Its culture and manufactures would langui&s;h if the li|mits of its con&s;umption were perceived. It is even nece&s;&s;ary that the&s;e markets &s;hould be &s;uperabun|dant; that one may &s;ucceed the other, in ca&s;e of un|&s;u&s;pected events, which might cau&s;e a momentary change in the ordinary cour&s;e of things.</P>
<P>What cau&s;e has thrown Ireland into &s;o continued a &s;tate of languor, although one of tho&s;e countries the mo&s;t favoured by nature, and the be&s;t &s;ituated for exterior commerce, if it is not the deprivation of that commerce? An embarra&s;&s;ing exuberance of productions was feared: the cultivation of them was pre&s;ently neglected, and this negligence increa&s;ed wa&s;te lands. This i&s;land would at length have of|fered a &s;pectacle of the mo&s;t deplorable mi&s;ery, of a complete depopulation, if, by a re&s;titution of the li|berty of commerce, an end had not been put to &s;o cruel a di&s;couragement which choaked indu&s;try, by making it fear a want of markets for the vent of its productions.</P>
<P>Let our patriots, therefore, cea&s;e to look upon fo|reign commerce as contrary to the reforms which are to revive our interior trade: to encourage the fir&s;t is not to pro&s;cribe the &s;econd, becau&s;e one cannot &s;ucceed without the other. But, on the contrary, the &s;eeds of activity are &s;own in the latter, by extending the boundaries of con&s;umption.</P>
<P>Alas! is not France evidently in need of them? Are not her magazines crouded with a &s;uperfluity of the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary productions, for which &s;he has no market? Such as, among&s;t others, her wines and brandies.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Such is the &s;ituation of Aunis and Saintonge&mdash;plentiful vintages are there literally feared, and the&s;e provinces are at this moment over-charged with wine, for which they have no exportation: the people are mi&s;erable in the mid&s;t of abundance. See Note, Chap. V. Sect. 1.</NOTE> The United States offer to her an im|men&s;e

con&s;umption; why does &s;he refu&s;e to &s;upply them?</P>
<P>Even if her wines and brandies were not in &s;uch &s;uperfluity, it would be prejudicial not to &s;upport the price of them by foreign con&s;umptions. The greate&s;t &s;courge of indu&s;try, and e&s;pecially of manu|factures, is the low price of tho&s;e liquors which are &s;educing by their &s;trength. On this account prudent manufacturers carefully avoid wine countries. It would be &s;uperfluous to give a detail of their rea|&s;ons; but certainly the politician, the mo&s;t jealous of a free extention of individual enjoyments, will never become an advocate for the indulgence of men in tho&s;e articles which deprive them of their faculties and rea&s;on.</P>
<P>France ought to de&s;ire the commerce of the United States. She ought al&s;o to be anxious for it on ac|count of her manufactures, to employ her popula|tion which is in want of work. Con&s;equently work|man&s;hip is cheap; whence re&s;ults indigence, beg|gary, and &s;trife.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Means are every day &s;ought to dimini&s;h and prevent crimes &mdash;Let property or employ be given to tho&s;e who are without them: this is the &s;ecret&mdash;It mu&s;t notwith&s;tanding be agreed, that property is preferable to employ in work&s;hops; under this point of view, commerce with the United States, in opening to us a great market, will be a means of dimini&s;hing mendicity and vices in France.</NOTE> Work and productions are in|crea&s;ed by opening new markets. Thus, for exam|ple, vineyards will remain, which a want of con|&s;umption would &s;oon cau&s;e to be de&s;troyed; thou|&s;ands of labourers, who langui&s;h, will be employ|ed; &s;ociety will be increa&s;ed by thou&s;ands of indivi|duals; more corn, more cloth, &amp;c. will be nece&s;&s;ary: hence an increa&s;e of interior con&s;umption and po|pulation.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="028343_0076_0FD8AF6BCC606178">When we examine the que&s;tion, if exterior com|merce be advantageous and nece&s;&s;ary to a nation; a newly con&s;tituted &s;tate, who&s;e population is far from being in proportion to its &s;oil, where there is &s;pace and property in land for every one, mu&s;t be di&s;tin|gui&s;hed from that which is ancient, rich in produc|tions as well as in men; or, to &s;peak with more pre|ci&s;ion, a &s;tate where the unequal di&s;tribution of pro|perty takes men from the fields, &s;huts them up in cities, and pro&s;titutes their faculties to the fancies of the rich.</P>
<P>Certainly &s;uch a new &s;tate cannot increa&s;e its fo|reign commerce before it has cleared great quantities of lands, and is become con&s;iderably peopled, and has a &s;urplus of men and productions.</P>
<P>Such a &s;tate, while nece&s;&s;ary, will undoubtedly follow this coun&s;el.</P>
<P>But this coun&s;el would be improper to another &s;tate, which, advanced in its civilization, covered with a population without property, having manu|factures and money in abundance; who&s;e indu&s;try and territorial riches wait for demands, and who&s;e culture langui&s;hes for want of markets. A foreign commerce is nece&s;&s;ary to this &s;tate to vivify it.</P>
<P>Such is the &s;ituation of France; neither &s;oil, in|du&s;try, activity, nor the thir&s;t of gain, is there want|ing; other pernicious cau&s;es &s;lacken her interior commerce. If the merchant has not a certainty of markets, he does not buy nor give orders; the ma|nufacturer employs fewer hands, has le&s;s occa&s;ion for the productions of the earth. Languor then de|&s;cends from manufactures to cultivation, and dimi|ni&s;hes population.</P>
<P>The rever&s;e will be the ca&s;e in the &s;uppo&s;ition of a va&s;t exterior commerce, and will lead to the im|provement even of our manufactures; for the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of improving to obtain a preference will ob|lige manufacturers to &s;tudy the ta&s;te of the Ameri|cans,

and to conform them&s;elves to it, to vary the productions of their indu&s;try; and will oblige them not to relax, that they may not be &s;urpa&s;&s;ed by rivals.</P>
<P>It is here nece&s;&s;ary to make &s;ome reflections on the general inferiority found in our manufactures, on comparing them with tho&s;e of the Engli&s;h. This fact has furni&s;hed Lord Sheffield with his principal argument, to maintain that America will always prefer the latter. It is nece&s;&s;ary to clear up this point, which &s;eems not to be well under&s;tood.</P>
<P>Manufactures of luxury, of conveniency, and of nece&s;&s;ity, mu&s;t be di&s;tingui&s;hed in a manner hereaf|ter pointed out.

<P>SOME writers, among whom are found the cele|brated Dr. Price, and the Abb&eacute; Mably, have exhort|ed the independent Americans, if not to exclude ex|terior commerce entirely from their ports, at lea&s;t to keep it within very contracted bounds.

<P>I am far from contradicting, <HI>in its ba&s;is,</HI> the opinion of the&s;e politicians.

<P>I will prove, that having no manufactures, they cannot them&s;elves &s;upply the&s;e wants, and that they can have no manufactures for a long time to come.</P>
<P>That although they already po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them, they ought to prefer to national ones tho&s;e of exterior commerce, and that they &s;hould rather invite Euro|peans

<P>Finally, that by the &s;ame rea&s;on which makes it impo&s;&s;ible to exclude exterior commerce, in ca&s;e of wants which alone it can &s;upply, it is equally &s;o to fix its boundaries.</P>
<P>When the nature of man is attentively con&s;idered, it is &s;een that it ince&s;&s;antly di&s;po&s;es him to render his life agreeable. If he has a property, he &s;trives to improve it; if the &s;oil he cultivates be fruitful, and demands but little in advance, the de&s;ire of in|crea&s;ing his enjoyments &s;timulates him to torture his land to draw from it its various productions. One idea put in practice gives birth to another; one want &s;atisfied creates a &s;econd, to have the plea&s;ure of &s;a|tisfying this al&s;o. Such is the nature of man; his activity, which leads him from de&s;ires to enjoyments, from one change to another, is the &s;ource of what are called manufactures. A manufacture is but the means of giving to a production of the earth, a form which adds to it a new degree of agreeablene&s;s and utility. Want and de&s;ire of manufactures are there|fore in the nature of man; &s;o that if we &s;uppo&s;ed Europe entirely annihilated, manufactures would &s;oon ri&s;e up in America, becau&s;e each individual &s;trives to render his exi&s;tence agreeable by means the mo&s;t &s;peedy and efficacious.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Perhaps the character and life of &s;avages, who are &s;up|po&s;ed to have no manufactures among them, will be oppo&s;ed to the&s;e rea&s;onings?

<P><PB N="49" REF="028343_0083_0FD8AF7EAB0F9AF8">Manufactures, like the wants of civilized men, may (as was ob&s;erved in the la&s;t chapter) be divided into three cla&s;&s;es: 1&s;t. tho&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity; 2d. tho&s;e of convenience; 3d. tho&s;e of fancy or luxury. Food, and the natural exigencies of mankind, are compre|hended in the fir&s;t cla&s;s.</P>
<P>It is from the wants of convenience e&s;pecially, that manufactures have their origin. Without doubt, &s;kins of &s;heep were &s;ufficient to defend men from the &s;everities of cold; a cabin or a hut from the in|temperature of the atmo&s;phere; but man is no &s;ooner pre&s;erved from one evil than he &s;eeks to get rid of another. Skins are in&s;u&s;ceptible of being well join|ed together; u&s;e makes them hard; a cabin is frequent|ly thrown down, is confined and &s;moaky; whence ari&s;e the wants of conveniency, which are transform|ed into enjoyments, who&s;e accu&s;tomed u&s;e changes them into nece&s;&s;ities.</P>
<P>When man has every convenience, he then thinks of ornament. Hence the wants of luxury; they are entirely in the imagination, and procure imaginary plea&s;ures only. Therefore to wear any laced clothes, or drink coffee out of a china rather than a delfen cup, is a want created by luxury or fancy.</P>
<P>The nature of the&s;e three kinds of want being pointed out, it is nece&s;&s;ary to know what tho&s;e of the Americans are. They have the two fir&s;t of them. Their habitudes contracted in their infancy&punc; from European emigrants, and their commerce with the Engli&s;h, have accu&s;tomed them to the kind of life and

<P>The independent Americans, at lea&s;t tho&s;e who inhabit great maritime cities, have borrowed from the Engli&s;h a ta&s;te for luxuries; they &s;eek for gauzes, blond lace, &s;ilks, &amp;c. It is however with plea&s;ure I ob&s;erve, that if this ta&s;te of modes has infected Lon|don within the&s;e few years, its ravages have not been extended with the &s;ame rapidity in the United States as in Eu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ope. Their &s;ituation, au&s;tere religion, morals, and ancient habits, their rural or marine life, prevent their &s;eeking after elegance and dre&s;s, and keep them from o&s;tentation and voluptuou&s;ne&s;s. Al|though they may perhaps be changed a few degrees, the evil is not yet &s;en&s;ible, at lea&s;t in the Northern States <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Luxury is certainly to be found in Virginia; and when we &s;peak of luxury with re&s;pect to free America, it is nece&s;&s;ary to di&s;tingui&s;h carefully the Southern from the Northern States; cities from the country; maritime cities from interior ones.

<P>The manner in which population is renewed and

<P>A prodigious number of individuals emigrate every year from all parts of Europe to America, who carry with them wants and inclinations which they have from education and habit.

Remembrance, although frequently mixed with the cruel idea of &s;ervitude, abandons man in the grave only.</P>
<P>According to this inclination, natural to all men, let the immen&s;e variety of wants and appetites be calculated which are going to tran&s;plant them&s;elves from Europe to the United States; and let it be judged, whether it be po&s;&s;ible to put bounds to or de&s;troy them.</P>

Carrying back with him to his own country this di&s;po&s;ition of mind, he introduces it in&s;en&s;ibly into the minds of tho&s;e who are about him, upon which it has &s;ome in|fluence&mdash;upon the minds of his children and friends. Their ta&s;te for &s;implicity becomes lukewarm by his

example, and the following age &s;ees public virtues fall into indifference.</P>
<P>It will be le&s;s dangerous to the public &s;pirit of the independent Americans to admit the Europeans into the United States, than to go them&s;elves into Europe; from which it re&s;ults that it would be very impolitic to encourage the former to become the carriers of their exterior commerce.</P>
<P>I have in&s;i&s;ted upon this reflection becau&s;e there &s;eems to have appeared in &s;ome States a di&s;po&s;ition to give premiums for di&s;tant navigation. They ought to reflect, that they have but few hands, and that as few as po&s;&s;ible &s;hould be taken from culture. They are in the &s;ituation I have &s;poken of in my principles of exterior commerce, where a nation gains by making carriers of others having le&s;s &s;oil or employ. They &s;hould al&s;o recollect, that republi|can morals are better pre&s;erved in the bo&s;om of agri|culture than upon the &s;ea and in foreign voyages, which give to men communications with other mo|rals and governments.</P>
<P>It is a general que&s;tion in the United States, by what means it is po&s;&s;ible to put bounds to exterior commerce, and &s;top the progre&s;s of luxury: &s;tay at home,&mdash;cultivate, cultivate, I will repeat to them; this is the &s;ecret whereby you will prevent the in|crea&s;e of luxury; a &s;ecret much preferable to &s;ump|tuary laws and prohibitory regulations, which &s;ome &s;tates have it in contemplation to make.</P>
<P>There is no power great enough to &s;et, by regula|tions, &s;uch boundaries to exterior commerce as will not be exceeded: to circum&s;cribe it, for in&s;tance, to merchandizes of convenience, without the importa|tion of tho&s;e of luxury. The nature or force of things only has &s;uch a power. That force has, as has been before explained, the union of the natural circum&s;tances of a nation; the&s;e circum&s;tances alone mark the limits of commerce. A nation which
<PB N="61" REF="028343_0095_0FD8AF9E64CD3BF0">
cannot pay for luxuries with its own production, does not purcha&s;e them. The &s;avage can only pro|cure with his furs, brandy, gunpowder, and woollen coverings; he buys neither &s;ilks nor laces.</P>
<P>If, therefore, the productions of the United States be &s;carcely &s;ufficient to pay for the importations of nece&s;&s;ity and convenience from Europe, merchan|dizes of luxury will not be imported: if the&s;e be carried to it, 'tis becau&s;e it can pay for them. There is no merchant who likes to ruin him&s;elf.</P>
<P>If, on the contrary, the United States have pro|ductions proper for the ancient continent, in quan|tities &s;ufficient to procure, by their exchange, not only the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary and convenient things, but even tho&s;e of luxury, nothing can hinder the latter from being &s;ooner or later imported, by means of exterior commerce.</P>
<P>In truth, to increa&s;e demands of this nature, the public opinion, which before treated opprobriou&s;ly a ta&s;te for modes, mu&s;t totally change, and the par|ticular opinions of certain &s;ects equally yield to it.</P>
<P>But notwith&s;tanding the powerful influence of opinion upon merchandizes of luxury, the fate of this kind of commerce will be more particularly de|termined by the &s;tate of the independent Americans, for when rich they will adopt them. This fact will appear certain, if what has been &s;aid on the nature of the human heart be recollected, and its inclina|tion to improve man's &s;ituation, and to increa&s;e his enjoyments.</P>
<P>Ta&s;te for a rural life alone, if the Americans pre|&s;erve it, will retard the progre&s;s of luxury, which &s;prings up in cities, from &s;atiety, want of &s;omething to do, and from la&s;&s;itude: employment pre&s;erves the country from tho&s;e moral ills.</P>
<P>There is one la&s;t con&s;ideration, which ought to per&s;uade the independent Americans to employ them&s;elves in cultivation, and reject both manufac|tures
<PB N="62" REF="028343_0096_0FD8AFA06028D960">
and exterior tran&s;ports; which is, that in wi&s;h|ing to undertake every thing at once, the &s;carcity of money, nece&s;&s;ary at lea&s;t for the mechanical part of the&s;e operations, will always be more perceived, whil&s;t, by giving them&s;elves up entirely to cultiva|tion, they will procure from their &s;oil productions &s;ufficient to pay for the&s;e manufactures from Europe, and to make up for the &s;carcity of coin.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The independent Americans have but little money; this &s;carcity ari&s;es from two cau&s;es; fir&s;t, from the kind of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">om|merce they heretofore carried on with England, and afterwards from the ravages of a &s;even years war. As this commerce was purely one of exchange, and that in certain &s;tates, as Virginia, the importations always &s;urpa&s;&s;ed the exportations; the re&s;ult was, that they could not but be debtors to England, and could not draw money from that i&s;land.</P>
<P>It was a kind of commercial &s;ervitude, which the Engli&s;h looked upon as the pledge and guarantee of the dependence of the Colonies upon the mother country.</P>
<P>The money they had came from their illicit commerce with the Sugar I&s;lands and European powers. The war, afterwards, by changing labourers into &s;oldiers, cau&s;ed a part of their lands to remain without cultivation. From that time exchanges in|crea&s;ed and money decrea&s;ed. The little of it remaining in America, came fir&s;t from money carried and expended there by the Engli&s;h and French armies, and afterwards by the loans ne|gociated in Europe by Congre&s;s.</P>
<P>But it is ea&s;y to conceive, after what has been &s;aid upon the quantity of coin, how a nation, which, by an extraordinary revolution, is all at once widely developed, its population ra|pidly increa&s;ed, and is thereby obliged to continual advances, for clearing of lands, for building, making of roads and canals, to pay foreign debts, mo&s;tly in &s;pecie, and which has no mines, mu&s;t feel the &s;carcity of money, and the rea&s;on of it is clear: the want of it is at pre&s;ent &s;upplied, in Connecticut, by an ex|change of commodities, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the&s;e again&s;t labour.</P></NOTE></P>
<P>They appear to be alarmed at this; what has been &s;aid upon the &s;ubject of money ought to remove their fears. It has been demon&s;trated that a nation may carry on a very con&s;iderable commerce without its aid. It will hereafter be &s;een that the United States produce many raw materials e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary to
<PB N="63" REF="028343_0097_0FD8AFA1DF7A6D08">
France, and that &s;he can make their exports with greater advantage than tho&s;e of any other country.</P>
<P>Thus it appears that the&s;e two countries may carry on together a direct trade of exchange without mo|ney, con&s;equently an advantageous one; for the ex|change between them of productions is more lucra|tive than an exchange of productions for money; although this opinion may not be adopted by men in general, who attach a greater price to gold than to merchandize, and continually forget its repre&s;enta|tive value, to &s;ub&s;titute for it a real one. It mu&s;t be ince&s;&s;antly repeated to them that money would be ab&s;olutely nothing without productions; that a rich people is that which, by its indu&s;try, increa&s;es po|pulation, and has con&s;equently an abundance of productions; that the &s;ecret of increa&s;ing the quan|tity of coin con&s;i&s;ts only in the art of multiplying nece&s;&s;ary productions, and it is this to which the United States ought to incline, without being anxious about the money which they may have at pre&s;ent or in future.</P>
<P>Let us re&s;ume the different que&s;tions contained in this chapter.</P>
<P>My object has been to make it appear that the United States were forced by their nece&s;&s;ity and cir|cum&s;tances to engage in exterior commerce.</P>
<P>To convince my readers of this, I have proved that the independent Americans had wants of ne|ce&s;&s;ity, of convenience, and even &s;ome of luxury, which they could neither renounce nor &s;upply them|&s;elves with.</P>
<P>That having no manufactures of their own, they were obliged to have recour&s;e to tho&s;e of Europe: that they could e&s;tabli&s;h none for a long time, having but few hands, and that cultivation ought to employ all their cares.</P>
<P>That according to phy&s;ical, political, and moral relations, they ought to per&s;evere in applying them|&s;elves
<PB N="64" REF="028343_0098_0FD8ADB6AC0EBB78">
to agriculture alone, and even give up all thoughts of tran&s;porting to Europe, by their own means, their proper productions.</P>
<P>That this was the only means of pre&s;erving their republican morals, and of retarding the progre&s;s of luxury.</P>
<P>In fine, that by engaging in agriculture, and ne|glecting manufactures, they will le&s;s perceive the want of money, and will find the means of &s;up|plying that want, and of carrying on a very advan|tageous exterior commerce of exchange of commo|dities.</P>
<P>The&s;e different points being firmly e&s;tabli&s;h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d, it is at pre&s;ent nece&s;&s;ary to prove, that of all the nations of Europe, France is the mo&s;t proper to enter into a commercial alliance with the United States, and that their nece&s;&s;ities and productions are corre&s;pon|dent to each other. It is propo&s;ed to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ay open this truth, by pre&s;enting the double table of reciprocal importations and exportations, to be made between France and free America.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER V. Of the Importation to be made from France into the United States, or of the Wants of the United States, and the Productions of France which corre&s;pond thereto.</HEAD>
<P>THE attentive reader will have already been able to judge, that if the independent Americans do not deviate from the career which is open to them, Europe will, for a long time, have to furni&s;h them with manufactured merchandize. It has been made to appear, that the clearing and cultivation of lands, and all that relates to inferior commerce, &s;uch as roads and canals, offered to their indu&s;try the mo&s;t

<P>It is now nece&s;&s;ary to take a cur&s;ory view of their wants, and to point out tho&s;e articles with which France may pretend to furni&s;h them in competition with other nations, if even &s;he cannot do it more advantageou&s;ly than her rivals. I will follow, in this enumeration, the Engli&s;h publications which have treated upon the matter, and particularly that of <HI>Lord Sheffield:</HI> he has omitted nothing, becau&s;e his country pretends to furni&s;h every thing.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I will not de&s;cend to the minutiae his Lord&s;hip has done, but I will prove, in every important article, the French, if they know how to profit by their natural advantages, mu&s;t ob|tain a preference.</NOTE></P>

<HEAD>SECTION I. Wines.</HEAD>
<P>Wine becomes a real want of tho&s;e who have once been acquainted with it. Happy or mi&s;erable, rich or poor, every body makes u&s;e of wine. Wine is the delight of the happy or of the rich: it helps the unfortunate to &s;upport his &s;orrow; the poor think they find it an equivalent for the food they are without.</P>
<P>Ea&s;e has lately been too general in the United States, not to have introduced the u&s;e of wine; and futurity, by augmenting their means, will only in|crea&s;e their want of this liquor.</P>
<P>The wines which were mo&s;t generally con&s;umed in the United States, were, as in England, Oporto, Madeira, and &s;ome from Spain. French wines, charged as in Britain, with enormous duties, were introduced by contraband only.</P>
<P>Liberty has cau&s;ed tho&s;e Britannic &s;hackles to di&s;|appear.
<PB N="66" REF="028343_0100_0FD8ADBCE998E148">
French wines are freely imported into the United States&punc; and pay but little duty.</P>
<P>Such is the &s;tate of things, and it leads me to the dicu&s;&s;ion of three que&s;tions:</P>
<P>Does it &s;uit the United States to cultivate vines, and to make wine?</P>
<P>Ought they not, in renouncing this cultivation, to give the preference to French wines?</P>
<P>And what means ought the French to u&s;e, in order to obtain and pre&s;erve this preference?</P>
<P>It would be ab&s;urd to deny that the United States can produce wine, becau&s;e the experiments hitherto made have been fruitle&s;s. Extended as they are, and having countries as &s;outhern as Europe, it is im|po&s;&s;ible there &s;hould not be, in many places, a &s;oil proper for the vine.</P>
<P>The little &s;ucce&s;s of attempts may therefore, without hazarding too much, be attributed either to the ignorance of the cultivator, his want of per&s;e|verance, or a bad choice of plants.</P>
<P>However that may be, if the Americans will hearken to the coun&s;els of able ob&s;ervers, and reap advant<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ge from the errors of other nations, they will carefully avoid the cultivation of vines. In every country where they have been cultivated, for one rich man, they have made a number wretched.</P>
<P>The long and con&s;iderable advances which vines require, the preparation, pre&s;ervation, and &s;ale of their produce, have put all the good vineyard plots into the hands of rich people, who not cultivating the&s;e them&s;elves, pay the real cultivator very badly. The &s;alary of the wretched vine-dre&s;&s;er is every where inevitably fixed; the time he does not work not being calculated, and few wine countries offer any employ by which lo&s;t time may be filled up; and otherwi&s;e, the variations in the prices of the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary commodities occa&s;ioned by a thou&s;and
<PB N="67" REF="028343_0101_0FD8ADBE3B2A0EA0">
cau&s;es, by the abundance or even &s;carcity of wine, are not con&s;idered for him.</P>
<P>Would it be believed, that abundance is the mo&s;t unfortunate thing that can happen, either to the pro|prietor or the vine-dre&s;&s;er? In fact, the expence of gathering augments, and the price of the thing di|mini&s;hes. There is more work to be done, more hands are nece&s;&s;ary, and they are paid more wages; more hog&s;heads are wanted, the expences of carriage greater, more &s;pace is required, the &s;ale is le&s;s, and con&s;equently the income.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The day's work of a vintager varies according to the &s;carcity or abundance of wine, from &s;ix to fifty &s;ol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. The price of hog&s;heads has likewi&s;e variations in a different price, from three to fifteen livres. There are years wherein the price of the hog&s;head is higher than that of the wine which it contains.</P>
<P>The proprietor who e&s;tabli&s;hes his expences upon his reve|nues, is every year deceived by tho&s;e of the vineyard. In one year he receives at the rate of 20 for 100; the &s;econd year his vineyard is perhaps de&s;troyed by hail; the third he is expo&s;ed to bankrupcy, or to &s;uffer by it, or his wines turn &s;our; the fourth he may have but a moderate produce, which will not compen&s;ate for his preceding lo&s;&s;es. In ten years time a pro|prietor would &s;carcely find an average year which was tolerably good; yet, as men l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e to exaggerate their riches and mean<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, each proprietor calculates his revenue upon the highe&s;t produce that his vineyard has ever yielded: the greate&s;t part of them &s;pend in con&s;equence, and are ruined.</P></NOTE></P>
<P>The &s;carcity of wines, or the &s;terility of the vine|yard, is perhaps le&s;s unfortunate than the abundance, at lea&s;t to the proprietor. But it is cruelly felt by the vine-dre&s;&s;er, and tho&s;e wandering troops of day labourers, whom the ingratitude of their &s;oil, or a bad government, forces to go from home in &s;earch of employ.</P>
<P>The numerous variations which have an influence upon the produce of the vineyard, make it very in|convenient property, and triflingly advantageous.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">It is a p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">overb in France, that there is no property wor&s;e conditioned than that of the vineyard.</NOTE>

But an unju&s;t and tyrannical tax, laid on by the proprietors them&s;elves, reduces this half to a quarter part.</NOTE> without any of the&s;e re&s;ources, ruins him|&s;elf &s;ooner or later. He is obliged to &s;ell at a low price,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Such is nearly the &s;ituation of mo&s;t of the vine-dre&s;&s;ers of AUNIS, who are proprietors. They are at the mercy of the rich farmers of that country. When winter comes, the vine-dre&s;&s;er has neither bread nor money. He goes to the farmer, a&s;ks him for both: the farmer &s;ays I will accommodate you, give me your note. The bu&s;he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of wheat is worth &s;ix livres, oblige your&s;elf to return me, at a certain epocha, the quanti|ty of wheat which &s;hall be &s;old for &s;ix livres. He always takes care to &s;ix the time when corn is at a low price. The obliga|tion is pa&s;&s;ed, the moment of payment arrives; the vine-dre&s;&s;er, who has corn, gives more than he has received. If he has none, he is &s;till more embarra&s;&s;ed; the farmer pre&s;&s;es him&mdash;you have wine, &s;ays he, &s;ell it me. But at what price? The farmer of|fers a very low one.

Too much wine in the time of abundance, no bread in that of &s;carcity; the&s;e are the two alternatives which divide his life.</P>
<P>Therefore countries covered with vineyards are generally le&s;s peopled, and pre&s;ent a picture of a de|generated, weak, and wretched population. For the mo&s;t part they want hands to cultivate the vineyard in a &s;ea&s;on when work cannot be delayed. It is done by the&s;e bands of &s;trangers, of whom I have
<PB N="69" REF="028343_0103_0FD8ADC442D91488">
already &s;poken, and who come to &s;ell &s;ome days work to the poor vine-dre&s;&s;er.</P>
<P>The cultivation of a vineyard cannot be better compared than to tho&s;e manufactures, of which the hopes of &s;ucce&s;s are founded upon the low price of workman&s;hip, and which enrich none but the under|takers, and retailers or &s;hopkeepers.</P>
<P>The pernicious influence of the vine is extended, in wine countries, to even tho&s;e who do not cultivate it; for the cheapne&s;s of wine leads to exce&s;&s;es, and con&s;equently it becomes a poi&s;on for all ranks of &s;ociety, for tho&s;e e&s;pecially who find in it a means of forgetting their &s;orrows.</P>
<P>Therefore, as I have already remarked, indu&s;try carefully avoids the&s;e dangerous vineyard plots. None of the great manufactures, who&s;e &s;ucce&s;s is the con|&s;equence of order, a&s;&s;iduity, and labour, are &s;een in the neighbourhood of them.</P>
<P>The re&s;ult of all the&s;e ob&s;ervations is, that the Americans ought to pro&s;cribe the cultivation of the vine.</P>
<P>It would infallibly render mi&s;erable that cla&s;s of &s;ociety which &s;hould apply it&s;elf to it, and in a re|public there &s;hould be none who are wretched, be|cau&s;e want obliges them to di&s;turb civil order, or, what is wor&s;e, becau&s;e they are at the command of the rich, by whom they are paid, and who may make u&s;e of them to de&s;troy republicani&s;m.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The mean language of &s;hopkeepers, who humbly offer their merchandize, has already begun to find its way into the American papers.</NOTE></P>

In that ca&s;e want would be no longer feared. The embarra&s;&s;ment about the legi&s;lation of corn would di&s;appear, and mi&s;ery perhaps be driven from among men.</NOTE></P>
<P>Finally, if it be in&s;i&s;ted that wine is nece&s;&s;ary to man, let it not &s;tupify him; it &s;hould be u&s;ed with moderation, and its dearne&s;s alone may oblige men to be moderate in the u&s;e of it.

<P>The catalogue which I have ju&s;t gone over, of the evils and abu&s;es occa&s;ioned by the culture of vines, will not induce the French to pull up theirs. But it ought at lea&s;t to excite them to increa&s;e in foreign

<P>The United States (the&s;e &s;tates of &s;o new a date) already furni&s;h us the model of an in&s;titution, which alone would encourage the culture of corn and vines,

and make the momentary inconvenience of abundant vintages, which ruin the proprietor and farmer, di&s;appear.</P>
<P>This in&s;titution, ea&s;y to be naturalized in France, would have two branches, a depo&s;it in the public magazines of the productions of the earth; certificate or billets of depo&s;it which would form an authentic title for the di&s;po&s;ing proprietor, transferable without formalities at the current price, like all other public effects.</P>
<P>It is thus, that in Virginia means have been found to &s;upply the want of money,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Virginians have given another example which proves how ea&s;y it is to do without money.

<P>This mini&s;ter clearly perceived, that the confidence of the people ought to be gained at any price, for the e&s;tabli&s;hment which exi&s;ts but by confidence; and that in &s;uch a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a&s;e, the &s;acrifice of power would &s;ignify nothing to a government which is really willing to prevent abu&s;es.</P>
<P>The advantages re&s;ulting from a plan like this are vi&s;ible. Public depo&s;itories would &s;upply the defect of ability in tho&s;e who could not lay up the productions of the earth.

that a chymi&s;t ought not to be a chymi&s;t only, but a politician al&s;o.</P>
<P>The brandies of France are generally locked upon as the be&s;t, that is to &s;ay, the mo&s;t delicate and lea&s;t pernicious: therefore they obtain the preference with people in ea&s;y circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>A great deal of brandy is con&s;umed by the com|mon people; but this is counter-balanced at home and abroad by &s;pirits drawn from grain, fruit, or &s;ugar.</P>
<P>Rum, which is produced from the latter, has had, and ever will have, in the United States, the pre|ference over our brandies, by rea&s;on of its cheap|ne&s;s. The American<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, e&s;pecially the Bo&s;tonians, import mela&s;&s;es from the &s;ugar i&s;lands, and di&s;til it, and independently of their con&s;umption, they re|&s;ell a great part of it to the inhabitants of the &s;ame I&s;lands, who cannot di&s;til it for want of combu&s;tibles.</P>
<P>Be&s;ide rum, the Americans make &s;trong &s;pirits from grain, potatoes, &amp;c. They are indebted for this to the Iri&s;h and Germans who have gone to &s;ettle in the United States. A pernicious pre&s;ent tho&s;e emigrants have made them.</P>
<P>In Ireland the cheapne&s;s of &s;pirits made from grain places them within the reach of the poore&s;t man. The lowe&s;t cla&s;&s;es of &s;ociety u&s;e them to an incredible exce&s;s; and this exce&s;s contributes not a little to promote that quarrel&s;ome humour which characteri&s;es the Iri&s;h, to plunge them into &s;tupidity, and hinder them from ri&s;ing to that degree of pro&s;|perity to which the liberty of commerce they have lately obtained ought to carry them.</P>
<P>The Americans would already have experienced a part of that degradation of which the exce&s;&s;ive u&s;e of &s;trong liquors is the cau&s;e, if they were not almo&s;t all proprietors, in ea&s;y circum&s;tances, and fathers of families; if in&s;truction and morals were not more generally propagated among them than among any

<HEAD>SECTION V. Linens.</HEAD>
<P>There are two principal &s;pecies of linen-drapery, which are &s;ubdivided into a multitude of others.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t &s;pecies contains linen properly &s;o called; that is to &s;ay, linen which &s;erves to make &s;hirts, &s;heets, table linen, and all the linen made u&s;e of for every purpo&s;e of cleanline&s;s.</P>
<P>The&s;e linens are made with hemp, flax, or cotton; this la&s;t article is employed when the two former ones are &s;carce: it is &s;ometimes mixed with flax.</P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="028343_0119_0FD8ADEB68F40628">The manner of making the&s;e linens is very &s;im|ple; they are made in all parts of Europe.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>If there be a country where the manufacture of linens is encouraged, it is in Ireland, particularly &s;ince its re&s;urrection into the political world.

There is one who has obtained more than thirty thou&s;and pounds &s;terling from government, and who&s;e manufacture employs two thou&s;and men and women, and &s;ix hundred children.</P>
<P>This committee names in&s;pectors to examine the &s;tate of ma|nufactures, and afterwards to make reports, or give a general de&s;cription of their &s;ituation, of the number of workmen they employ, of their produce, re&s;ources, wants, &amp;c.<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">When the&s;e in&s;pectors are hone&s;t, and men of under&s;tand|ing, their reports are evidences of &s;ucce&s;s.

<P>Still more has been done in Ireland, to encourage the com|merce of linen; great edifices have been built, and de&s;tined to receive them, as well as tho&s;e who come to offer them for &s;ale. The mo&s;t con&s;iderable market being at Dublin, three or four times a year, linen merchants from the North, who have bleach-yards, come to Dublin with their a&s;&s;ortments.

<P>Every where el&s;e, the country people employ, more or le&s;s, the lei&s;ure which their kind of life af|fords them to &s;pin and weave linen.

<P>As the&s;e machines are in&s;en&s;ibly introduced into countries, it may be expected that the low price of linen-drapery will be every where e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>
<P>But notwith&s;tanding the multiplication of the&s;e machines, nations which groan under a bad govern|ment, or are grown ru&s;ty in old and wretched habits, will always depend, for that article of nece&s;&s;ity, upon tho&s;e which have e&s;tabli&s;hed bounds to their govern|ment, but none for their indu&s;try, which mu&s;t con|&s;tantly increa&s;e.</P>

<P>Although a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ne hat be called a beaver, it does not follow that Canada and the United Northern States are more favourable to the fabrication of hats than France. Hats, purely of beaver, do not wear well, and are inconvenient on account of their weight. The fine&s;t, hand&s;ome&s;t, and be&s;t hats, contain but little of the fur of that animal, which we e&s;teem at too high a price, when we think of the lo&s;s of Ca|nada.

<P>The few hats made of beaver in the United States will be &s;ufficient for their con&s;umption.&mdash;The Ame|ricans mu&s;t, however, be ince&s;&s;antly told this great truth, that manufactures are not proper for them ex|cept in tho&s;e articles which are immediately a&s;&s;ociated with agriculture, and which facilitate its operations.

<P>Europe will therefore furni&s;h hats to the Ameri|cans. And of what great importance is this object, when the rapid increa&s;e of their population is con|&s;idered?

<HEAD>SECTION VIII. Leather. Shoes, Boots, Saddles, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>To what cau&s;e ought the great &s;uperiority of Eng|li&s;h leather to be attributed over ours? Why is there in this leather-work of all kinds that neatne&s;s, that &s;educing appearance, which we have not yet ap|proached? It mu&s;t be repeated, that in England men honour the profe&s;&s;ion of a tanner, and pride them&s;elves upon it, whil&s;t it is the contrary in France. An Engli&s;h tanner, &s;hoemaker, or &s;addler, does not quit his trade when he is rich; but makes his riches &s;erve, in proportion as they augment, to give lu&s;tre to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">is profe&s;&s;ion, to multiply his work&s;hops, to ex|tend his affairs, to become important even in the article which has furni&s;hed him the means of doing it. The leather which comes from the tanneries who&s;e owner is in ea&s;y circum&s;tances, is always well prepared, becau&s;e he can advance &s;ums of money, and give to hides the time nece&s;&s;ary for their progre&s;s through his tan-yard. A poor tanner is always pre&s;&s;ed by his wanting to take the leather out of the tan-pit, where it is nece&s;&s;ary it &s;hould remain a long time to acquire a good quality. In general, it is im|po&s;&s;ible with this penury, unknown to the Engli&s;h, that there &s;hould be time to manufacture or fabricate good merchandize. Tho&s;e who employ the leather, acquire no reputation in their profe&s;&s;ions but in proportion to great provi&s;ions made before hand, which puts it in their power to furni&s;h nothing but leather improved by being kept. It will be a&s;ked, how the whole&s;ale dealers manage when they begin bu&s;ine&s;s? They find credit, if in their apprentice|&s;hips,

<P>It is not that the French tanner, who barters his profe&s;&s;ion again&s;t a brevet of Secretaire du Roi, or commi&s;&s;ary of war, ought to be blamed. He rea&s;ons well. He &s;ees that no con|&s;ideration is attached to talents and indu&s;try, and he delays not to buy him&s;elf a title.

It is an evil to the &s;tate, but it is not the fault of tho&s;e who purcha&s;e. The fault is due to the kind of di&s;grace from which government has not yet delivered the ignoble.</P>
<P>It ought to be ob&s;erved here, how fatal the &s;peculation which e&s;tabli&s;hed this order of things has been to the nation. To pro|cure money, offices were created; which, by ennobling, induces the ignoble to purcha&s;e them; they are di&s;gu&s;ted with their &s;itua|tion by being di&s;honoured, and for a few millions of livres, which this pitiful operation &s;lowly procures, commerce is ruined by having its capital dimini&s;hed: that commerce, which, by being &s;upported, would continually produce millions to the &s;tate.</P></NOTE></P>

<P>Such is the art of the Engli&s;h to &s;upport and in|crea&s;e their commerce in every thing, and every where.

<P>The con&s;umption of the&s;e two articles is immen&s;e in the United States; the &s;ingle article of nails amounts to con&s;iderable &s;ums. This will not appear extraordinary, when it is remembered, that all the hou&s;es, all the inclo&s;ures of the Ameicans, are of wood, that they build a great number of &s;hips, which require frequent reparations.</P>

<P>The Americans are &s;ingularly curious in the choice of the fir&s;t nece&s;&s;ity. They have therein the gene|ral ta&s;te of the Engli&s;h; they will have that only which is good. On comparing tho&s;e which they make them&s;elves with the tools made in France, it mu&s;t be acknowledged that we are far from that per|fection at which they are arrived in them: this per|fection is owing to the ea&s;e of the labourer, and to the con&s;ideration attached to agriculture. Imper|fection is a nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence of re&s;traint and di&s;honour.</P>
<P>The Americans have attempted to make iron and &s;teel. Many manufactories have been &s;et up at New-York, in New-Jer&s;ey, and in Penn&s;ylvania: it is true that the&s;e manufactures are few in number, but they will nece&s;&s;arily increa&s;e for the rea&s;ons which I &s;hall hereafter give.</P>
<P>England heretofore exported a con&s;iderable quan|tity of iron and &s;teel:<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>To favour the exportation of the&s;e articles, the parliament had forbidden all the e&s;tabli&s;hment of mills and other machines in the United States for making of &s;teel.

<P>It may be judged by this circum&s;tance to what a point the mother country, or rather the monopolizers, can carry avari|ciou&s;ne&s;s; &s;ince the Americans were forbidden to enjoy tho&s;e advantages which nature had thrown before them. Mono|poly re&s;pects nothing. When the&s;e attempts are con&s;idered, ought we to be &s;urpri&s;ed at the eternal mi&s;under&s;tanding be|tween colonies and the mother country, a mi&s;under&s;tanding which fini&s;hes either by the ruin of the former, or their &s;epa|ration from the latter?</P></NOTE> her mines not having yet fur|ni&s;hed

She did no more with regard to America than &s;tand be|tween her and others, and this circuit augmented the expences of the coloni&s;t, without procuring him any benefit. This will exi&s;t no longer, becau&s;e the A|mericans are about to trade directly with the Swedes and Ru&s;&s;ians.</P>
<P>Lord Sheffield calculates, that one year with ano|ther England imported 50,000 tons of foreign iron, of which from 15 to 20,000 was afterwards exported to the colonies either in its natural &s;tate or worked up.</P>
<P>The profit to the mother country was, according to his Lord&s;hip, 12,000,000 lives, or thereabouts.</P>
<P>During the war, and &s;ince the peace, &s;ome exports of this kind have been made from France to the United States; but they did not &s;ucceed. Accu&s;tom|ed, according to the principles of monopolizers, who have hitherto directed our foreign commerce, to fur|ni&s;h our colonies with brittle uten&s;ils, and otherwi&s;e very imperfect, our merchants were willing to treat the independent Americans like their &s;laves in their i&s;lands;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The Chamber of Commerce of Mar&s;eilles, in an in&s;truc|tion very well drawn up, addre&s;&s;ed in 1784 to the merchants, had recommended them to act contrarily&mdash;"Recollect," &s;aid it,

<P>I have not read this in&s;truction. A man of letters, who has re&s;ided a long time in the country, has given me the ideas of it, which I have related.

<P>It is probable enough that the Engli&s;h legi&s;lature will &s;uppre&s;s them according to the advice of Lord Sheffield; and this, joined to the benefit of the oeco|nomy procured by the di&s;covery of Lord Dundonald, and of Me&s;&s;rs.

<P>This diminution is one of the cau&s;es which mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily hinder us from attempting a rivality in this particular with the Engli&s;h; but there is another, which is &s;till more deci&s;ive.</P>
<P>In fact, the ob&s;ervations made heretofore upon the nece&s;&s;ity of de&s;troying our gla&s;s manufactories, ap|ply naturally to that con&s;iderable branch <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">f iron-work, of which the workman&s;hip is the lea&s;t ex|pence, and which requires a great quantity of com|bu&s;tible materials.

<P>Let it be remarked, that the&s;e manufactures being joined to a life of agriculture, and carried on in the mid&s;t of it for its u&s;es, can have none of the perni|cious influences which ought to be feared in tho&s;e complicated manufactures which are obliged to be concentrated in the inclo&s;ures of cities, who&s;e de|&s;tructive

<P>This, however, is not the ca&s;e with every article of curio&s;ity of iron, &s;teel, or copper work, wherein the workman&s;hip exceeds the other expences. They belong to that weak organization which the Ameri|cans ought not to envy. But it mu&s;t not be di&s;&s;imu|lated, that a competition with the Engli&s;h will, on this head, be difficult to maintain: their great ability and addre&s;s in the di&s;tribution of work and different proce&s;&s;es, the invention of which has not been con|&s;trained by any error<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Tho&s;e fal&s;e views cannot be too much deplored&mdash;tho&s;e nar|row ideas&mdash;tho&s;e fears of ignorance, which &s;natch from the hands of indu&s;try the happy inventions which are proper to en|rich a whole nation! Who can calculate the riches that England owes to the &s;ole application of the coining-mill, or engine and dye, who&s;e free u&s;e has been left to all the manufactures which it was capable of improving in accelerating their effects?

<P>It is true that at pre&s;ent arti&s;ts are permitted to have mills, &amp;c. by conforming them&s;elves to certain formalities,&mdash;always formalities?

Has fal&s;e money overturned public order, impoveri&s;hed the nation, or dimini&s;hed her revenues?</P>
<P>With what difficulty has the invention of the coining-mill made its way into France? It is due to an indu&s;trious French|man of the fifteenth century, named Briois. Per&s;ecuted for this di&s;covery, he was obliged to take refuge in England; the Engli&s;h received him favourably, and put his invention into execution. Another Frenchman of the name of Warin, of the la&s;t century, wi&s;hed to procure the advantages of it to his countrymen; he experienced a like ab&s;urd per&s;ecution; and with|out the &s;upport of the Chancellor Sequier, he would have failed in his attempt.&mdash;I do not allow my&s;elf to &s;peak of the per|fection to which M. Droz pretends to have brought the coin|ing mill at pre&s;ent; but by the vexations he &s;uffers, it may be judged that he has in fact &s;implified that machine, that he has rendered fewer hands nece&s;&s;ary, and the coinage of money more perfect and expeditious; two advantages very precious in this art, as the expences of it cannot be too much reduced, and the ex|actitude and perfection of the &s;tamp of money are the &s;ure&s;t means of di&s;concerting coiners. What fatal genius is it there|fore which pur&s;ues indu&s;try in France? That of companies, of corporations, of privileges.

<P>But if there be an object of commerce for which Europeans need not fear a reciprocal competition; if there be an article which offers to all European manufactures a certain and lucrative employ, it is that of paper: the con&s;umption will always be equal at lea&s;t to the production, and its numerous u&s;es in|&s;ure a &s;till greater con&s;umption, in proportion as po|pulation, commerce, and knowledge, &s;ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l increa&s;e.</P>
<P>Every nation ought therefore to ob&s;erve without jealou&s;y, that each country &s;trives to have within it&s;elf manufactures of this kind.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>The King's intention being to favour as much as po&s;&s;ible the commerce of the United States, I have the honour to communicate to you &s;ome di&s;po&s;itions made for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>By a letter of the 9th of January, 1784, to the Marquis de la Fayette, I informed him, that in&s;tead of two free ports, promi&s;ed by the treaty to the United States, the king had determined to grant them four, which has been effected; and I promi&s;ed him to con&s;ider the cu&s;toms and duties on importation and exportation which &s;hackle commerce; ob&s;erv|ing to him, that the&s;e objects required con&s;iderable application; they have not yet been completed. By another letter I informed the Marquis, that his Ma|je&s;ty had &s;uppre&s;&s;ed the duties on the exportation of brandy, a mea&s;ure which he hoped would be u&s;eful to American commerce; I a&s;&s;ured him al&s;o, that the duties of the king and admiralty, payable by an
<PB N="121" REF="028343_0155_0FD8AE3D21C20378">
American ve&s;&s;el on its arrival in a port of France, &s;hould be dimini&s;hed; and afterwards that &s;uch of them as remained, &s;hould be reduced to a &s;ingle duty, to be regulated according to the number of ma&s;ts or draught of water, and not according to the two uncertain e&s;timation of gauging. This reduction requires an exact knowledge of all the duties received in the ports, and as they are of various &s;pecies, the &s;tate which I ordered to be draw a up of them has not yet been given in.</P>
<P>You know, Sir, the king has charged a particular committee, to examine our commercial connexions with the United States, and that the Marquis de la Fayette has laid before it a project analogous to the ideas contained in your letter to the Count de Ver|gennes: but you mu&s;t perceive, how imprudent it would be to hazard, by a change of &s;y&s;tem, the pro|duce of a branch of revenue, which amounts to twen|ty-eight millions of livres, without falling upon any object of the fir&s;t nece&s;&s;ity. After an ample di&s;cu&s;|&s;ion of every thing which might at pre&s;ent favour the importation of tobacco from America to France, it has been decreed, not that the agreement made with Mr. Morris &s;hould be departed from, but that, after the expiration of it, no other of the &s;ame import &s;hould be made; and that in the mean time the Far|mers General &s;hould be obliged to purcha&s;e annually about fifteen thou&s;and hog&s;heads of American tobac|co, coming directly from the United States in French or American &s;hips, at the &s;ame prices as &s;tipulated in the contract made with Mr. Morris.</P>
<P>You will recollect, Sir, that whil&s;t the demands which had been made for wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">le oil were under con|&s;ideration, the Marquis de la Fayette made a private arrangement with M. Sangrain, permitting him to receive as much of that article as &s;hould amount to eight hundred thou&s;and livres tournois, and that I had granted pa&s;&s;ports to exempt this fir&s;t quantity
<PB N="122" REF="028343_0156_0FD8AE40A7D259E8">
from all duties what&s;oever. M. Sangrain made af|terwards an agreement with the merchants of Bo&s;ton for whale oil, to the amount of four hundred thou|&s;and livres a year, for &s;ix years, for which his Ma|je&s;ty has promi&s;ed the &s;ame favours as enjoyed by the Han&s;e towns.</P>
<P>This manner having lately been examined under a more general point of view, the admini&s;tration, to which the committee has made its report comform|able to the reque&s;t of the Marquis de la Fayette, and to your opinion, relative to the entire abolition of all duties on oils, has di&s;covered that it cannot con&s;ent to it for the pre&s;ent, on account of engagements en|tered into with other powers. All that could be done was to in&s;ure, for ten years, whale oil, &s;per|maceti, and every thing comprehended under the&s;e denominations, coming from the United States in French or American &s;hips, the &s;ame favours and mo|deration of duties as are enjoyed by the Han&s;e towns.</P>
<P>His Maje&s;ty hopes commercial connexions be|tween the United States and France will become ex|ten&s;ive enough to engage him to continue the effect of this provi&s;ionary deci&s;ion; and as it has been ob|&s;erved in the committee, that a con&s;iderable duty was paid upon the making of the mo&s;t favoured whale oils, and even upon national ones, his Maje&s;ty con|&s;ents to aboli&s;h this duty with re&s;pect to the former, and upon &s;permaceti coming immediately from the United States in French and American &s;hips; &s;o that &s;permaceti and the&s;e oils will have to pay, for ten years to come, no more than &s;even livres ten &s;ols, and the ten &s;ols per pound, for all manner of duty; the la&s;t augmentation of ten &s;ols per pound to cea&s;e in 1790.</P>
<P>It has been determined to gain particular infor|mation upon the con&s;umption in France of rice from Carolina, and that encouragement &s;hould be given to the exportation of that article.</P>
<P><PB N="123" REF="028343_0157_0FD8AE424EB580C0">Upon the repre&s;entations which have been made, touching the con&s;iderable duties paid on the entry of pot a&s;h and pearl a&s;h, as well as relative to tho&s;e of beaver &s;kins and fur, and raw hides, his Maje&s;ty has &s;uppre&s;&s;ed all the duties on pot a&s;h&mdash;on the fur and &s;kins of beavers&mdash;and on hides, coming raw from the United States, on board American or French ve&s;&s;els. He will al&s;o con&s;ider of proper encourage|ments to be given to every article of the &s;kin and fur trade.</P>

<P>The committee having al&s;o repre&s;ented, that there was a duty of five per cent. upon the purcha&s;e of ve&s;&s;els built abroad, and that this duty was prejudi|cial to the &s;ale of American ve&s;&s;els, his Maje&s;ty has taken this into his con&s;ideration, and exempted the purcha&s;e of all &s;hips, which &s;hall be proved to have been con&s;tructed in the United States, from every duty of the kind.</P>
<P>Trees, &s;mall &s;hrubs, and &s;eeds of trees al&s;o, pay high duties, which his Maje&s;ty has agreed to aboli&s;h upon &s;uch as &s;hall be &s;ent from the United States to France, on board French or American &s;hips.</P>
<P>It having been repre&s;ented, that the &s;tate of Vir|ginia had ordered arms for its militia to be made in France, it has been determined, that the prohibitions which have hitherto hindered the exportation of arms and gunpowder, as well as the duties required in ca&s;es of particular permi&s;&s;i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">, &s;hould be aboli&s;h|ed, and that whenever the United States &s;hall wi&s;h to have from France, arms, fu&s;ils, and gunpowder, they &s;hall have full liberty to do it, provided it be in French or American &s;hips, and that tho&s;e articles
<PB N="124" REF="028343_0158_0FD8AE439F5CBB78">
&s;hall be &s;ubject to a very moderate duty only, &s;olely for the purpo&s;e of calculating the exportations.</P>
<P>Finally, his Maje&s;ty has received in the &s;ame fa|vourable manner the demand made to the commit|tee to &s;uppre&s;s the con&s;iderable duties hitherto paid on books and paper of every kind. His Maje&s;ty &s;uppre&s;&s;es all duties on articles of this kind, de&s;tined to the United States, and put into French or Ame|rican ve&s;&s;els.</P>

<HEAD>EXPORTS OF AMERICA.</HEAD>
<P>I WILL treat but of a few of the articles which America furni&s;hes, on account of the attention which they all merit.</P>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECTION I. Tobacco.</HEAD>
<P>Of all the articles which France may procure from the United States, tobacco is the mo&s;t important one to the inhabitants of the two countries. If it cannot be cla&s;&s;ed with our mo&s;t urgent nece&s;&s;ities, it follows them &s;o clo&s;e, that excepting ca&s;es wherein the u&s;e of it excites di&s;gu&s;t, the deprivation of it ordinarily di&s;covers the la&s;t degree of mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t not be &s;urpri&s;ed at its general u&s;e.&mdash; The man greedy of &s;en&s;ations has found one lively enough in tobacco: it is perhaps the only one which he can enjoy at plea&s;ure without injuring his health, dimini&s;hing his &s;trength, or &s;u&s;pending his work or meditations. Tobacco awakens the mind agree|ably, and ob&s;ervers who have remarked the innocent plea&s;ure, the &s;pecies of in&s;tantaneous comfort, which a little tobacco procures to a poor man, borne down by the weight of affliction, have always wi&s;hed that &s;o &s;imple an enjoyment &s;hould be improved and be|come le&s;s and le&s;s expen&s;ive; and they cannot re|flect without horror on the crime of that fi&s;cal in|du&s;try, which, hardened by monopoly to increa&s;e its profits, adulterates &s;nuff &s;o much, as to make it pernicious to health.</P>
<P><PB N="126" REF="028343_0160_0FD8AE4B6F5BF278">The con&s;umption of tobacco mu&s;t therefore be|come more and more con&s;iderable, and the com|merce of this leaf, already very important, cannot be decrea&s;ed but by the diminution of its cultivation; which the policy of America will never permit.</P>
<P>The cultivation of tobacco is by no means proper for the European States, which have acquired popu|lation <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nough to apply another kind of cultivation to all their good lands.</P>
<P>It is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the Al&s;aciens cultivate a little tobacco, and they boa&s;t of it; but they would make a greater profit if they cultivated their lands for provi&s;ions. This experience is deci&s;ive for France, where none of tho&s;e rich lands exi&s;t which are &s;o well known in America. It is therefore the intere&s;t of France to get tobacco from abroad, but it mu&s;t be paid for by her manufactures: &s;he may enjoy this advantage more fully with free America than with any other country. I will n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t repeat the rea&s;ons of it; I will ob&s;erve only, that the free Americans, having an immen&s;e extent of lands which cannot be cleared but in the cour&s;e of &s;everal centuries, mu&s;t have, for a long time to come, tobacco to &s;end to Europe, &s;ince this produc|tion pays with u&s;ury the expences of clearing.</P>
<P>It is true, that the cultivation of tobacco in Ame|rica mu&s;t be farther and farther from the &s;ea, and that the expences of carriage may become con&s;iderable.</P>
<P>But different con&s;iderations place this epocha at a di&s;tance; fir&s;t, in cultivating tobacco in none but ab&s;olute new lands, the cultivation is much le&s;s ex|pen&s;ive, and the produce con&s;iderably more abun|dant; con&s;equently it will co&s;t much le&s;s in a new &s;oil than when the &s;oil requires more labour and ma|nure. Secondly, America, inter&s;ected in every di|rection by rivers and lakes, has infinite re&s;ources for rendering water carriage every where ea&s;y, and con|&s;equently never expen&s;ive. It is ea&s;y to multiply canals, and con&s;equently communications: no part
<PB N="127" REF="028343_0161_0FD8AE4C9E7787B0">
of the world is &s;o much favoured in this re&s;pect as America. Thirdly, The banks of the Ohio and the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi offer immen&s;e lands to be cleared: the Ohio falls into the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi, which falls in its turn into the &s;ea: the&s;e two rivers are almo&s;t every where navigable, and the lands near them produce already excellent tobacco, and will continue to do &s;o for a long time.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is impo&s;&s;ible to view, wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hout indignation, that narrow policy of Spain, which would &s;hut out the Americans from all communication with the &s;ea by the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi. How is it, that &s;he cannot perceive, that her mercantile intere&s;t invites her, on the contrary, to favour this navigation, by erecting &s;tore hou&s;es upon the banks of this river near to its mouth? Is &s;he ignorant of the advantages of depo&s;itories? And with re&s;pect to her po|litical intere&s;t, is there a greater one for her in the&s;e countries, than to make her&s;elf immediately nece&s;&s;ary to American e&s;ta|bli&s;hments, within the reach of the Ohio? Mu&s;t &s;he wait till they adopt other means? What will be gained by creating di&s;|content among a free people? If it be wi&s;hed that the&s;e people &s;hould not become powerful, they mu&s;t be de&s;troyed; and if this barbarity belongs not to the eighteenth century, it is nece&s;&s;ary to make friends of them. Expedients in politics are childi&s;h and vain.</NOTE> Fourthly, If the price of tobacco &s;hould be increa&s;ed, France would not feel the difference, if the free Americans, preferring the culture, con|tinued to want European manufactures, and gave the preference to tho&s;e of France. According to this &s;y&s;tem, the exchange of merchandize, manufactured in France for the productions of the &s;oil of America, may be &s;till made with advantage, if even the&s;e pro|ductions were &s;old in France below the fir&s;t co&s;t in America. We have long &s;een the French commerce of the Levant produce great profits, although the merchandize brought in return was &s;old at a le&s;s price in France than it co&s;t at the place where it was produced. This circum&s;tance &s;till exi&s;ts.</P>
<P>Therefore the &s;peculation, mo&s;t to the intere&s;t of France, is to take as much tobacco as &s;he can con|&s;ume
<PB N="128" REF="028343_0162_0FD8AE50049A5070">
from the Americans, and pay for it with her manufactures.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The tobacco leaf, of which the farmers general had the entire monopoly, or exclu&s;ive &s;ale, produced to the king a clear nett revenue, annually, of between twenty-eight and twenty-nine millions of livres.</NOTE></P>

<HEAD>SECTION II. Fi&s;heries, Whale Oil, &amp;c. Spermaceti Candles.</HEAD>
<P>Among the articles of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence which nature has liberally given to men, fi&s;h is one of the mo&s;t abundant, the mo&s;t ea&s;y to be procured, and the mo&s;t proper to pre&s;erve their health and &s;trength.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Such is the powerful influence on population, of the abun|dance of articles of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, and e&s;pecially that of fi&s;h, that it is principally to this article of life that the empire of China owes the incredible number of its inhabitants.</NOTE> By what fatal privilege is this food confined in France almo&s;t to the rich? Why does not fi&s;h abound in all places, where this tribute of the &s;ea can be received in its original &s;tate, and without being charged with the expences of two long a carriage? Since it is &s;o well known, that it is advantageous to a &s;tate, and to every cla&s;s of citizens, to procure an abundance, and a variety of eatables, let them come from where they will, or of whatever nature they be, provided they be cheap <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> whole&s;ome: why is this political rule departed from, with re&s;pect to fi&s;h, to that ali|ment which nature produces every where with &s;uch fecundity?

fi&s;heries.&mdash;His Lord&s;hip agrees, that the indepen|dent Americans have, for the great fi&s;hery, natural advantages, with which it is impo&s;&s;ible for the Eu|ropeans to contend.</P>

If accidents happen, they are &s;oon repaired; all their operations are more prompt and &s;ure; having a better know|ledge of the&s;e &s;eas, they are expo&s;ed to le&s;s ri&s;ks than Europeans: finally, their proximity to the fi&s;heries a&s;&s;ures them provi&s;ions more fre&s;h,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Such is the advantage of the Americans, that they furni&s;h provi&s;ions to the &s;edentary fi&s;heries of the Engli&s;h. According to Colonel Champion, the provi&s;ions of Europe are more dear, and not &s;o good; the difference in favour of the Americans i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> in the proportion of four to &s;even; and it cannot be otherwi&s;e.</NOTE> and puts it in their power to renew them more frequently; con&s;e|quently their fi&s;hermen enjoy more con&s;tant health, and have older officers and &s;ailors among them: the&s;e are ine&s;timable advantages to America.</P>
<P>The Engli&s;h have very few of the&s;e advantages; the French &s;carcely any.&mdash;But ought we to conclude with Lord Sheffield, from this order of things, that American fi&s;h &s;hould be charged with duties, in or|der to &s;upport the national fi&s;hery, again&s;t this com|petition? the nature of things dictates to France more wi&s;e and advantageous means.&mdash;Fi&s;h is nouri&s;hing &mdash;whatever is nouri&s;hing is prolifi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">: if the Ameri|cans fi&s;h at le&s;s expence than th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> French, &s;o much the better for the la&s;t; fi&s;h will be more abundant, and at a lower pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ce in France. Let France open her ports; the Americans will bring fi&s;h into them, and will pay them&s;elves with either the productions of the &s;oil of France, or of her indu&s;try; and the po|pulation to which this abundance and cheapne&s;s are favourable, will increa&s;e the productions of French indu&s;try.</P>
<P><PB N="130" REF="028343_0164_0FD8AE56CBB49CD0">Moreover, it is nece&s;&s;ary, either to renounce ex|terior commence, or to con&s;ent that there &s;hall be &s;omething to exchange on both &s;ides. To wi&s;h to e&s;tabli&s;h and encourage a commerce with a foreign nation, and not to leave it to the care of furni&s;hing that which it collects with the greate&s;t facility, is a manife&s;t contradiction. The enlightened policy of commerce is not to invade all the branches of it, but to do nothing but that which can be done better and cheaper than any other. Therefore, &s;ince the Ame|ricans have fi&s;h on their coa&s;ts, &s;ince they are in the neighbourhood of Newfoundland, leave to their in|du&s;try that branch which nature has given to them in preference; let us not di&s;pute it with them: fir&s;t, becau&s;e it would be in vain to do it, and in the next place, becau&s;e France may reap, without fi&s;hing, more advantageou&s;ly the fruit of the American fi&s;heries.</P>
<P>"But," &s;ays Lord Sheffield,
<Q>&s;ailors mu&s;t be found for the navy; and the fi&s;heries are the nur&s;eries for them; therefore the fi&s;heries mu&s;t be &s;upported; and no fi&s;h con&s;umed but that which we take our|&s;elves; on which account premiums are nece&s;&s;ary.</Q></P>
<P>There is no doubt but &s;ailors are formed in the fi&s;heries, but it is not in throwing nets or hooks, in cur|ing or preparing fi&s;h, that this is done; it is by a fre|quent and long exerci&s;e on board ve&s;&s;els in laborious manoeuvres, in living, &s;o to &s;peak, among rocks, and in &s;eas, which the vicinity or nearne&s;s of oppo&s;ite coa&s;ts makes continually dangerous: now this exer|ci&s;e of vigilance, agility, and intelligence, is perform|ed by the &s;ailor in coa&s;ting and fi&s;hing on the coa&s;ts of his own country. Let coa&s;ting be frequent, and let not this fi&s;hery be di&s;couraged in France, and it will not be nece&s;&s;ary, in order to form &s;ailors, to &s;end them &s;o far to take fi&s;h, which they cannot bring to Europe without great expence: by which the con|&s;umption is con&s;equently limited, and which deprives us of the ine&s;timable advantage of receiving in abund|ance,

that which the independent Americans can take <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t much le&s;s expence.</P>
<P>Without doubt the exerci&s;e of the fi&s;heries of the North forms intrepid &s;ailors; and this painful life mu&s;t be con&s;ented to. But when nature has placed men in a climate where they have but a few &s;teps to make to the interior of the country,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The French fi&s;h but a part of the year; mo&s;t of the fi&s;h|ermen are day labourers, employed on land, which they leave in the month of February, and return to it in July.</NOTE> to find an oc|cupation exempt from dangers and le&s;s fatiguing, when they can get their bread upon land, under a clear and calm &s;ky, if he rea&s;ons, how will he be en|gaged to tru&s;t his life to boards, and to brave icy &s;eas, to expo&s;e him&s;elf during the fine&s;t months in the year to perpetual &s;torms, which a&s;&s;ail the&s;e fi&s;hing banks, &s;o frequently &s;tained, by means of the mo&s;t fatal errors, with European blood?</P>
<P>It will be an&s;wered, by premiums,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">England gives con&s;iderable premiums to her fi&s;hermen.&mdash; But the inconveniencies and abu&s;es of the fir&s;t premiums render them of no effect. The&s;e abu&s;es are chiefly as follows: The fi&s;hing ve&s;&s;el mu&s;t go to a certain port; the equipage mu&s;t pa&s;s in review before the Officers of the Cu&s;toms; the &s;hip mu&s;t com|plete her cargo, or remain three months at &s;ea to do it:&mdash;&s;o that if in the fir&s;t week &s;he procured nine-tenths of it, &s;he would be obliged to keep the &s;ea for the other tenth. The &s;hip can take no in&s;truments but tho&s;e proper for the fi&s;hery, to which the premium is applied; the cargo cannot be di&s;charged but in a certain port; there are general formalities to be ob&s;erved with re&s;pect to the &s;alt which &s;he carries out and brings home; the owners are expo&s;ed to vexations from Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e Officers, to law &s;uits which they are obliged to carry on in courts of ju&s;tice, far from their re&s;idence.&mdash;Judge if a poor fi&s;herman can expo&s;e him&s;elf to the&s;e inconveniencies; this is what has cau&s;ed fi&s;he|ries to decline, e&s;pecially tho&s;e of Scotland.&mdash;It is what has given &s;o much a&s;cendancy to the Dutch, who have no premi|ums. It is that which has rendered premiums u&s;ele&s;s. Other Governments adopt this method of giving premiums: the &s;ame difficulties are attached to them, and yet people are a&s;toni&s;hed that things go not on better.</NOTE> by privileges,
<PB N="132" REF="028343_0166_0FD8AE5C48BD0F80">
and by prohibitions or overcharges of duties, which are equivalent to prohibitions on foreign indu&s;try.</P>
<P>But it mu&s;t not be forgotten, that articles of &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence are here in que&s;tion, that tho&s;e forced means make them dearer, that their con&s;umption is then li|mited, and their effect re&s;trained; that in forcing na|ture in this manner, is doing it at the expence of po|pulation, for by this barbarous regimen, men are de|&s;troyed in&s;tead of being produced, whil&s;t permi&s;&s;ion to bring into &s;ea-ports the fi&s;h of tho&s;e who have no|thing better to do than to take it, would infallibly in|crea&s;e population.</P>
<P>Moreover, to whom are the&s;e premiums and all other favours, with which it is wi&s;hed to combat the nature of things, di&s;tributed? Does the individual of whom it is intended to make a &s;ailor enjoy any advantage from them? Let not men be deceived in this; they are the prey of the navigator, who goes out of his clo&s;et but to walk about, and who directs his &s;teps &s;ometimes toward the &s;ea &s;ide. He begins by taking his own &s;hare, and be per&s;uaded that the wages which he offers to tho&s;e whom he employs to conduct his perilous enterprize are par&s;imoniou&s;ly calculated; therefore the end is not attained.</P>
<P>If there be an ab&s;olute want of &s;ailors who have pa&s;&s;ed their noviciate about the banks of Newfound|land, and in the North &s;eas, there is a more &s;imple and &s;ure means, le&s;s expen&s;ive, and what is more important, one which is exempt from de&s;tructive con&s;equences, to form them. Choo&s;e from hone&s;t families young, robu&s;t and intelligent men; in&s;ure to them a per&s;onal recompen&s;e, if, after a certain number of voyages on board fi&s;hing ve&s;&s;els, they bring certificates of good behaviour, and of experi|ence acquired by practice. Oblige them to go on board ve&s;&s;els belonging to nations or cities, to which the&s;e difficult fi&s;heries are a nece&s;&s;ary re&s;ource. It is there they will acquire real knowledge. The&s;e,
<PB N="133" REF="028343_0167_0FD8AE5F613845C0">
added afterwards to &s;ailors exerci&s;ed in the coa&s;ting and in the fi&s;heries on their own coa&s;ts, will form for the navy experienced &s;ailors.</P>
<P><HI>Whale oil</HI> belongs to the fi&s;heries: it is another great article of commerce with the United States. All oil of this denomination is not produced by whales only; great quantities of it is drawn from &s;eals, and other &s;pecies of fi&s;h.</P>
<P>The u&s;e of this oil is much re&s;trained in France:<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">By &s;tatements which de&s;erve &s;ome faith it appears, that in 1784, the importation into France of whale oil, and that of other fi&s;h taken by the French, was 1,610,619 lb. Foreign oil, 2,748,099 lb. Portugal furni&s;hed almo&s;t half of the la&s;t.</NOTE> that of the white of the whale, and of which &s;uch fine candles are made, is little known there. The u&s;e of oil will become more general.</P>
<P>Lord Sheffield is of opinion, that &s;ound policy makes its nece&s;&s;ary that the Engli&s;h &s;hould prohibit, or at lea&s;t di&s;courage by duties, American oil. It was with this idea that the government of England impo&s;ed a duty of four hundred and fifty livres tour|nois per ton on oils imported by the independent Americans, to favour the oils of Canada and Nova-Scotia.</P>
<P>This rigour &s;hould make this production, which has been hitherto pro&s;cribed, received in France. The introduction of it is &s;o much the more nece&s;&s;ary, as the French whale fi&s;hery is ruined. Bayon, for|merly celebrated for this fi&s;hery, has abandoned it; Dunkirk, which continues to fit out ve&s;&s;els, furni&s;hes but little of this oil, at a very high price.</P>
<P>Whether the French go to the North, or towards Bra&s;il, they will labour under a di&s;advantage:&mdash; Without a&s;ylum in ca&s;e of misfortune, their naviga|tion is always longer and more expen&s;ive than that of other nations which carry on a whale fi&s;hery. It is therefore more to the advantage of France to re|ceive
<PB N="134" REF="028343_0168_0FD8AE60E1B27ED0">
American oil, and to pay for it with her wines and manufactures.</P>
<P>The French government &s;oon perceived the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of receiving the oils of America. Had not this been done, an emigration of American fi&s;her|men into Canada and Nova-Scotia would have been the con&s;equence. This was near happening, &s;ome time after the peace, in the i&s;land of Nantucket. In de&s;pair on &s;eeing the ports of England &s;hut, and not knowing where to &s;ell their oils, which alone &s;up|plied all their wants, the inhabitants had re&s;olved to emigrate to Nova-Scotia, when, on the moment of departure, they received a letter from the Marquis de la Fayette, whom they ju&s;tly looked upon as their patron and father. He per&s;uaded them to be pati|ent until the French government &s;hould &s;uppre&s;s or reduce the duties on oils, which have been reduced for a limited time; but during this time the indepen|dent Americans are to enjoy, with re&s;pect to their oils, all the advantages given to the mo&s;t favoured nation;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Such are the duties on whale oil, &amp;c. paid in France, ac|cording to the tarifs of 1664, and 1667; whale bone, cut and prepared by the French, thirty &s;ols per cwt. fins, three livres per cwt. a barrel of oil of five hundred pounds weight, three livres. Whale bone from foreign fi&s;heries pays, in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, nineteen livres, in the &s;econd, thirty livres, and twelve livres in the third.

<P>The white of the whale mu&s;t be added, and the candles made with this &s;ub&s;tance: they are known by the name of &s;permaceti candles, and &s;erve in&s;tead of very fine bougies or wax candles. The American Colonies exported of them, according to Lord Shef|field, to the amount of five hundred thou&s;and livres

<HEAD>SECTION III. Corn, Flour, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>Foreign corn and flour enter France on paying a duty too incon&s;iderable to make any &s;en&s;ible increa&s;e in their price. The principles laid down in the pre|ceding article, with re&s;pect to articles of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, mu&s;t be adopted for the commodities of corn and flour.</P>
<P>The corn merchant, the mo&s;t u&s;eful of all mer|chants (whatever the vulgar, who, from a want of information, confounds a dealer in corn with a mo|nopolizer, may think of him,) fears arbitrary excep|tions, &s;udden prohibitions, and unexpected &s;trokes of authority. This &s;tate of uncertainty prevents the &s;olid e&s;tabli&s;hment of the true &s;y&s;tem of liberty, whence re&s;ult innumerable inconveniencies, which no other &s;y&s;tem would bring on provided it were fixed, and that it afforded a certain ba&s;is of calcula|tion.</P>
<P>But how could a legi&s;lation for corn be formed which &s;hould not be one of liberty, and which &s;hould neverthele&s;s afford a like ba&s;is? This is impo&s;&s;ible&punc; &s;eeking, fir&s;t of all, the particular rules for every ca&s;e, when the&s;e are of a nature not to be fore&s;een, is &s;eek|ing for a chimera.</P>
<P>Not to fall into contradiction it is nece&s;&s;ary to choo&s;e between arbitrary power and liberty&mdash;But that which is arbitrary pre&s;ents nothing but a per&s;pec|tive which is naturally di&s;couraging. No property is &s;afe under this &s;y&s;tem; when it exi&s;ts, the mer|chant and the cultivator are obliged to hazard their property in a lottery, of which the chicaneries can|not be calculated; for it is nece&s;&s;ary to fore&s;ee the
<PB N="136" REF="028343_0170_0FD8AE664693FD90">
fal&s;e informations, errors, and manoeuvres, of an in|tere&s;t different from their own, and even from that of the public, the attempts of power, &amp;c. and if all the&s;e con&s;iderations ought to enter into the elements of their calculations, how can they found hopes on &s;uch a variable ba&s;is?</P>

<P>France, like other European &s;tates which have a royal navy and fleets of merchant &s;hips to keep in repair, imports timber from Livonia and Ru&s;&s;ia. This general magazine begins to be exhau&s;ted; the quality of its ma&s;ts is not &s;o good as formerly. This commerce is, moreover, attended with the di&s;ad|vantage to France of requiring con&s;iderable remit|tances of money, without reckoning the inconve|niencies of a dangerous navigation, frequently inter|rupted by ice; al&s;o the competition of &s;everal na|tions, which their proximity and many other cir|cum&s;tances naturalize, &s;o to &s;peak, in the ports and &s;eas of the North; advantages which the French cannot have.</P>
<P><PB N="140" REF="028343_0174_0FD8AE6F8687F388">The&s;e con&s;iderations ought to determine France to turn her attention to the United States, to procure from them the timber nece&s;&s;ary for her navy, and ma&s;t timber e&s;pecially. There is but one objection to this, and it ari&s;es from prejudice. It is pretend|ed in France, that the quality of American timber is very much inferior to that of the Baltic. Some people go &s;o far as to maintain that it is improper for the con&s;truction of ve&s;&s;els.

<P>Better directed inquiries, and a more attentive ex|amination, will &s;oon de&s;troy this prejudice again&s;t the quality of American timber; a prejudice &s;o much the more di&s;agreeable, as it would deprive the com|merce between France and the United States of an article important to the two nations.</P>

<P>This is confirmed to us by men who have travelled and re&s;ided in the United States.

<HEAD>SECTION IX. Ve&s;&s;els con&s;tructed in America, to be &s;old or freighted.</HEAD>
<P>It has been ob&s;erved that the bulk of the commo|dities which might be exchanged by the commerce between France and the United States, was, at an equal value, much more con&s;iderable on the &s;ide of America than that of France. There re&s;ults from this, that in the&s;e exchanges, a great number of Ame|rican ve&s;&s;els mu&s;t be &s;ubject to return to America in balla&s;t. This &s;tate of things would certainly be pre|judicial to the commerce between the two nations, if &s;ome compen&s;ation could not be e&s;tabli&s;hed which &s;hould remove the inequality.</P>
<P>This compen&s;ation may be made in a very advan|tageous manner to both. The independent Ameri|cans con&s;truct ve&s;&s;els for &s;ale: if it be agreeable to a nation to purcha&s;e of another the articles which this manufactures at a le&s;s expence, and with more means, it follows, that the French ought to buy American ve&s;&s;els; and, in fact, this commerce begins to be e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>
<P>Lord Sheffield reprobates this commerce with re|&s;pect to his own country.&mdash;"Its exi&s;tence," &s;ays his Lord&s;hip,
<Q>depends on its navy; this depends as much on Engli&s;h &s;hip-builders as on Engli&s;h &s;ailors; therefore, of all trades, that of &s;hip-build|ing is the mo&s;t important to be pre&s;erved in Great-Britain.</Q>
The advances, according to his Lord|&s;hip, are of little con&s;equence, and the&s;e ve&s;&s;els not being de&s;tined to be &s;old to foreigners, what they co&s;t ought to be con&s;idered &s;o much the le&s;s, as the ex|pence is incurred in the country.</P>
<P>Lord Sheffield pre&s;umes al&s;o, that &s;hip-building will be encouraged in New-Scotland, Canada, the I&s;land of St. John, &amp;c. Finally, his Lord&s;hip declares,
<Q>that the encouragement of &s;hip-building in the
<PB N="151" REF="028343_0183_0FD8AE8ADF9B3F60">
United States is ruinous to Great-Britain; that it is the &s;ame to tho&s;e who may purcha&s;e American built ve&s;&s;els; becau&s;e, notwith&s;tanding their cheap|ne&s;s, the&s;e ve&s;&s;els are little durable, from the na|ture of their materials.</Q>
This ob&s;ervation relates particularly to ve&s;&s;els built for &s;ale, which, his Lord|&s;hip &s;ays,
<Q>are very inferior to tho&s;e which are be|&s;poken.</Q></P>
<P>It cannot be denied, that it is of con&s;quence to a nation which attaches a great importance to its navy, to have &s;hip-builders. The repairs, &amp;c. of which ve&s;&s;els are con&s;tantly in want, would be badly di|rected, if there were not, in the cla&s;s of workmen to whom this indu&s;try belongs, men capable of con&s;tructing a ve&s;&s;el, and habituated to this con&s;truc|tion. What is &s;till more, as &s;oon as a nation has a navy, it is greatly to its intere&s;t to po&s;&s;e&s;s every means of improving it; and the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the&s;e means is &s;o much more &s;ecure when there are e&s;ta|bli&s;hments in the country which, in this ca&s;e, &s;up|port emulation, by the con&s;tant exerci&s;e of the art.</P>
<P>But it does not follow, that to pre&s;erve &s;uch an advantage, a nation ought to have no other ve&s;&s;els than tho&s;e which are home built: it is here nece&s;&s;ary to di&s;tingui&s;h &s;hips belonging to the royal navy from merchant &s;hips. The fir&s;t are alone &s;ufficient to employ a requi&s;ite number of able builders, and to &s;upply every thing which the con&s;truction and re|pairs of ve&s;&s;els require. But merchant &s;hips, of which a con&s;iderable number is wanted, may be procured from abroad, if tho&s;e of an equal quality can be had at a price con&s;iderably le&s;s.</P>
<P>Will it be &s;aid, that a nation becomes &s;o much the more powerful at &s;ea, as the con&s;truction of ve&s;|&s;els is encouraged in her ports? that under this point of view it is nece&s;&s;ary to be cautious not to furni&s;h the independent Americans with the means of forming a
<PB N="152" REF="028343_0186_0FD8AE8C8CD5B0B8">
navy, which would render them formidable? that it is at lea&s;t unnece&s;&s;ary to ha&s;ten the&s;e means?</P>
<P>If this con&s;ideration were true, it would in &s;ome mea&s;ure impo&s;e on France a law to encourage the United States to form their navy; for, however for|midable her own may be, &s;he has too many natural ob&s;tacles to remove for her navy to be the effect of any thing but painful efforts, and con&s;equently that it &s;hould be an e&s;tabli&s;hment very difficult to main|tain,&mdash;very expen&s;ive, and &s;ubject to long intermi&s;|&s;ions. And &s;ince it is nece&s;&s;ary to &s;peak con&s;tantly of a threatening rivality,&mdash;of an armed rivality,&mdash; France has the greate&s;t intere&s;t, to balance more &s;ure|ly the force of her rivals, by calling to her aid the naval force of a friendly people,&mdash;of a people to whom nature has been prodigal in the means &s;he has given them of having a con&s;iderable one.</P>
<P>But the policy which refu&s;ed to purcha&s;e Ameri|can ve&s;&s;els, for fear the Americans &s;hould become formidable at &s;ea, would be badly founded. A &s;ure manner of retarding the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a navy, by a nation which po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the means and materials; the power and activity which &s;uch a great e&s;tabli&s;hment requires, is to employ it continually in the con&s;truc|tion of ve&s;&s;els for &s;ale, and to habituate it to this kind of commerce. If this nation, and &s;uch is the po&s;i|tion of the United States, has nothing to fear inte|riorly from any other power, it will certainly de&s;pi&s;e all &s;uch military preparations, who&s;e profit and utility will not be &s;o immediately perceived, as the frequent gains of peaceful commerce. Therefore, let the inde|pendent Americans be per&s;uaded to build ve&s;&s;els for &s;ale: let them not be provoked to build &s;hips for de|fen&s;ive and offen&s;ive operations, and they will neg|lect the great means with which nature has furni&s;hed them, of having a re&s;pectable navy: they will even neglect them, when greater riches, and a more con|&s;iderable
<PB N="153" REF="028343_0187_0FD8AE905B051958">
population, &s;hall facilitate to them the u&s;e of their natural means.</P>
<P>Far from &s;uffering by this new arrangement of things, France would gain thereby. This idea will undoubtedly appear extraordinary, becau&s;e, in a|bandoning workman&s;hip to American &s;hip-builders, France is deprived of it: but how ea&s;ily may &s;he compen&s;ate this apparent lo&s;s! In fact, when no|thing is to be had without labour, it is then con&s;i|dered as real riches: therefore, it ought to be em|ployed with a prudent economy, e&s;pecially in the &s;y&s;tem of national rivalities. The workmen who will not build ve&s;&s;els, will make cloth, with which ve&s;&s;els may be paid for. The expence of manufac|turing the&s;e cloths will be paid at home, as that for the con&s;truction of ve&s;&s;els would have been; by which means the&s;e will be had at a cheaper rate. This labour and expence will therefore produce greater advantages, and place the nation in a more de&s;irable relation with its rivals.</P>
<P>Finally, Lord Sheffield, who&s;e narrow policy is here refuted, propo&s;es that &s;hip-building &s;hould be encouraged in Canada, New-Scotland, &amp;c. But do phy&s;ical circum&s;tances favour the&s;e countries as much as the United States? Can England reap real advantages from this encouragement? It is a que&s;|tion with which &s;everal writers have combated Lord Sheffield, and on which I cannot decide.</P>
<P>But if England had this re&s;ource, France would be without it. Ve&s;&s;els built in America will always co&s;t her le&s;s than her own, or tho&s;e con&s;tructed el&s;e|where: &s;he ought therefore to favour the introduc|tion of the fir&s;t.</P>
<P>A celebrated mini&s;ter, whom France has rea&s;on to regret, thought as follows: his de&s;ign was to get a part of the ve&s;&s;els of the French navy con&s;tructed in Sweden; he thereby expected to make great &s;av|ings:
<PB N="154" REF="028343_0188_0FD8AE91A3061468">
they will be greater and more real, in getting the ve&s;&s;els con&s;tructed in the United States.</P>
<P>The Engli&s;h them&s;elves will not be able to re&s;i&s;t the force of things; they will &s;ooner or latter return to the u&s;e of American ve&s;&s;els; for the&s;e co&s;t but a third<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In New-England the con&s;tructors of ve&s;&s;el make their bar|gains at the rate of three pounds &s;terling per ton, carpenter's work included.

<P>The bad quality attributed to American ve&s;&s;els is a fable, ari&s;ing from the following circum&s;tances: in the contention for independence, the Americans built ve&s;&s;els in ha&s;te, to arm them as crui&s;ers: they were forced to make u&s;e of wood which was green, and unprepared; other things were either wanting <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o the&s;e ve&s;&s;els, or precipitately prepared. Con&s;e|quently the ve&s;&s;els were imperfect; but this imper|fection was but accidental. A crui&s;e is a lottery, wherein no notice is taken of the goodne&s;s and dura|bility of the ve&s;&s;el. It is &s;ufficient that it be a good &s;ailer, this is the e&s;&s;ential quality.</P>
<P>Peace has re-e&s;tabli&s;hed the con&s;truction of ve&s;&s;els in the manner it ought to be; and there are American ve&s;&s;els built before the war, and &s;ome thirty years ago, which for goodne&s;s and duration are not inferior to any Engli&s;h ve&s;&s;el.</P>
<P>More progre&s;s has been made in America than any where el&s;e in the art of &s;hip-building; this is ea&s;ily explained:&mdash;it mu&s;t not be forgotten, when the inde|pendent Americans are &s;poken of, that they are not recovering from a &s;tate of barbarity.

cau&s;e a very con&s;iderable one in the inten&s;ity of indu&s;try.</P>
<P>Bo&s;ton has produced a man a&s;toni&s;hing in the art of &s;hip-building. Long and clo&s;ely employed in the &s;earch of means to unite &s;wiftne&s;s of &s;ailing in ve&s;&s;els to their &s;olidity, Mr. Peck has had the greate&s;t &s;uc|ce&s;s.

<P>The American Proverb &s;ays: <HI>That to have a perfect ve&s;&s;el, it mu&s;t have a Bo&s;ton bottom and Philadelphia &s;ides.</HI></P>
<P>The French, if connoi&s;&s;eurs be believed, are very inferior to the Americans in the minutiae of &s;hip-building.

Hence it re&s;ults, that the French, in pre|&s;erving every thing which can maintain among&s;t them an able cla&s;s of &s;hip-builders, mu&s;t buy ve&s;&s;els of the Americans; becau&s;e every convenience is united to that of facilitating their reciprocal impor|tations and exportations, of which the bulks are &s;o different in one nation from tho&s;e of the other.</P>
<P>This circum&s;tance is attended with the advantage of procuring the French merchant an American ve&s;|&s;el at a le&s;s price than if he had ordered it to be built, or if he bought it in America, becau&s;e it will always be more to the intere&s;t of the American to &s;ell his ve&s;&s;el, than to take it back in balla&s;t.</P>

<P>I ought to hope that the work, once known in the United States, will excite the independent Ame|ricans to co-operate with me, in what I have pro|po&s;ed to my&s;elf, which is to &s;pread in&s;truction on every thing which relates to their country.

<P>Why &s;hould not all nations under&s;tand a language <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o &s;imple, &s;o wi&s;e&punc; and &s;o proper to produce univer|&s;al harmony? But how are they to be made to un|der&s;tand it? By what means are they to be prevail|ed upon to adopt it? What means are proper to en|gage nations which might have a direct commerce between them, to &s;ign a treaty of commerce, which &s;hould leave each at liberty to furni&s;h that which it could export better and cheaper than others; and thus e&s;tabli&s;h exchanges on the immutable laws of nature?</P>
<P>As &s;oon as nations &s;hall be enlightened enough to perceive the advantage of &s;uch a treaty, from that moment it will cea&s;e to be nece&s;&s;ary, and every other treaty will be &s;till le&s;s &s;o. It will then be &s;een, that they all center in the &s;ingle word <HI>liberty.</HI> It will be di&s;covered that liberty can put every thing in its place; that liberty alone, without negociation or parchment, can every where give birth to an advan|tageous indu&s;try. Finally, that every where, and at all times, &s;he has &s;ported with tho&s;e commercial conventions, of which politicians have &s;o ridicu|lou&s;ly boa&s;ted; of tho&s;e conventions wherein the contracting parties are ince&s;&s;antly on the defen&s;ive with re&s;pect to each other&mdash;ince&s;&s;antly di&s;po&s;ed to deceive, and frequently multiply the &s;eeds of war in a work of peace.</P>
<P>Under &s;uch a &s;y&s;tem of liberty, there would be no longer occa&s;ion for craftine&s;s in national policy with re&s;pect to commerce:&mdash;of what u&s;e would it be? No more &s;trife; for it would have no object: no more jealou&s;y or rivality; no more fear of making others pro&s;per and become rich; becau&s;e the riches of each &s;tate would be advantageous to the whole.
<PB N="160" REF="028343_0194_0FD8AEA15EF66058">
In a word, according to this &s;y&s;tem, each nation would wi&s;h the other more means, in order to have more to give and more to receive. Commerce would become what it ought to be, the exchange of indu&s;try again&s;t indu&s;try; of enjoyments again&s;t en|joyments, and not again&s;t deprivations: finally, a &s;tate of riches, without poverty on any &s;ide.</P>
<P>What people have more right and title than the Americans, to be the fir&s;t in adopting &s;o philanthro|pical a &s;y&s;tem, and which is &s;o conformable to the laws of nature&mdash;at lea&s;t to do nothing which &s;hall retard it among them? Let their Congre&s;s,&mdash;that re&s;pectable a&s;&s;embly, which may become the light of nations, and from who&s;e deliberations univer&s;al happine&s;s may re&s;ult,&mdash;remain faithful to the indica|tions of this nature; let it interrogate her con&s;tantly, and give every nation the &s;ame &s;alutary habitude.</P>
<P>If Europe refu&s;es to admit the productions of the United States, let Congre&s;s, rejecting the poor policy of repri&s;als, open, by a great and republican re&s;olu|tion, their ports to all European productions. What evil can re&s;ult from this to the independent Ameri|cans? If European prohibitions rendered their means of exchange u&s;ele&s;s, European merchandize mu&s;t of cour&s;e be without a market in America; or, falling to a mean price in the United States, it would become profitable to the Americans in paying for it even with gold.</P>
<P>The law may be given to an idle and degraded na|tion, but never to one which is active and indu&s;tri|ous. This always puni&s;hes, in &s;ome manner or other, the tyrannical proceedings of other nations. The force of things is alone &s;ufficient to revenge it.</P>
<P>It is a misfortune to the United States, in not having been able to e&s;tabli&s;h at fir&s;t the noble &s;y&s;tem of which I have &s;poken, and to be obliged to have recour&s;e to the mi&s;erable means of other govern|ments,&mdash;that of impo&s;ing duties on foreign merchan|dize
<PB N="161" REF="028343_0195_0FD8AEA4558840B8">
to pay their debts. Every impo&s;ition but a quit-rent upon land is a &s;ource of errors. The <HI>pretended protecting duties</HI> impo&s;ed in Europe are one con&s;e|quence of the&s;e errors, and of which the effect leads government a&s;tray, &s;o far as to per&s;uade them, that they po&s;&s;e&s;s a creative force equal to that of the Divi|nity him&s;elf. And what are the&s;e enterpri&s;es by which men would force nature? Mi&s;erable hot-hou&s;es,&mdash;wherein every thing is ha&s;tened to fini&s;h the &s;ooner; wherein indu&s;try vainly exhau&s;ts it&s;elf to &s;upport an unnatural exi&s;tence; and wherein a vi|gorous whole is frequently &s;acrificed to a corrupted part.</P>
<P>Let the Americans carefully avoid the&s;e erroneous enterpri&s;es: to in&s;ure them&s;elves therefrom, let them con&s;ider the &s;tate of Europe. The Europeans have no longer any judgment in matters of impo&s;t: &s;imple ideas are lo&s;t, and become impo&s;&s;ible to be realized by the metaphy&s;ician, which it is nece&s;&s;ary to employ to combat ignorance, prejudices and habitudes: all ideas of ju&s;tice and propriety are confounded. A truth cannot be advanced without meeting, at every moment, fal&s;e notions to combat. The man of in|formation is fatigued, di&s;gu&s;ted, and frequently at a lo&s;s what to an&s;wer to objections proceeding from habits of error. He perceives with concern, that the laws of happine&s;s cannot be written, but upon tables from which there is nothing to be effaced: and &s;uch, I flatter my&s;elf, is the &s;ituation of the United States. They are yet virgin &s;tates&mdash;they are unac|quainted with the in&s;titutions which end in chaos, wherein the love of public good lo&s;es all its force.</P>
<P>Monte&s;quieu ob&s;erves, that the enterpri&s;es of mer|chants are always nece&s;&s;arily mixed with public af|fairs; but that in monarchies, public affairs are for the mo&s;t part &s;u&s;picious in the eyes of the merchants. But pro&s;perity and national glory depend on com|merce, as much in monarchies as in other con&s;titu|tions.
<PB N="162" REF="028343_0196_0FD8AEA6B19C87F0">
It is therefore the intere&s;t of monarchies to give to merchants that hope of pro&s;perity which they have in republics, and which inclines them with ar|dour to every kind of commercial enterpri&s;e.</P>
<P>Provincial admini&s;trations are the &s;ure&s;t means of producing this happy effect. If they were already e&s;tabli&s;hed, the French would comprehend, how ab|&s;urb it is to imagine that the United States will not di&s;charge their public debt; how impo&s;&s;ible it is that Republicans &s;hould make u&s;e of the di&s;honourable re&s;ource of bankruptcy and deception; and that their public &s;pirit, their morals, and intere&s;t, require them to di&s;charge this debt, contracted for the mo&s;t legiti|mate and honourable cau&s;e that ever exi&s;ted; and which is otherways but an atom when compared with their immen&s;e re&s;ources. French merchants would then give them&s;elves le&s;s concern about the manner in which their merchandize was to be paid for in America. For in the improbable ca&s;e of a want of American productions, or of precious me|tals, they have, as a la&s;t re&s;ource, the paper of Con|gre&s;s and the States; which paper it is an advantage to acquire, by the price at which it is obtained, by the intere&s;t it bears, the certainty of its being paid, and by the con&s;equent tran&s;mi&s;&s;ion which may be made of it in commerce to the Dutch merchant, to whom the paper of the whole world becomes nece&s;|&s;ary the moment it merits confidence.</P>
<P>I have mentioned precious metals. The Ameri|cans are in the neighbourhood of the countries which produce them. The&s;e countries are the abodes of indolence, which di&s;pen&s;es no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> with nece&s;&s;aries. Skins, &amp;c. of animals, and &s;ome metals, are every thing that can be given there in exchange for articles of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, which the inhabitants have not the courage to make their lands produce, and for the nece&s;&s;aries, for which they find it more convenient to pay with gold than with their indu&s;try. The in|dependent

Americans will become factors, advanta|geou&s;ly placed between European manufactures, and the inhabitants of regions condemned by nature to the &s;terile productions of metals. All the powers of Spain cannot prevent this, nor ought even to under|take it. This new con&s;ideration promi&s;ing to the French payment, &s;o fooli&s;hly de&s;ired in gold, ought to encourage them to prepare for a commercial con|nexion with the United States.</P>

<HEAD>CONCLUSION, And Reflections on the Situation of the United States.</HEAD>
<P>IT will be proper to fini&s;h this volume by &s;ome explanations of the pretended troubles which agi|tate the United States. The&s;e explanations are ne|ce&s;&s;ary to de&s;troy the unfavourable impre&s;&s;ions which mu&s;t be made by the unfaithful recitals of gazette writers, who, from &s;ervile prejudices or mean inte|re&s;t, affect to &s;pread doubts of the happy con&s;equen|ces of the revolution. If we believe the&s;e people, the independent Americans are plunged into inextri|cable embarra&s;&s;ments, forced to become bankrupts, given up to the mo&s;t violent anarchy, expo&s;ed to the tomahawk of the implacable Indians, &amp;c. How is it po&s;&s;ible to re&s;olve to carry on a commerce with people who&s;e &s;ituation is &s;o deplorable? Ought not their ruin to be feared rather than their fortune hoped for, in the connexions which it is wi&s;hed to form with them?</P>
<P>It is nece&s;&s;ary to refute the&s;e fal&s;ehoods. It is &s;o much the more &s;o, as ignorance ea&s;ily leads people, little acquainted with republican con&s;titutions, into
<PB N="164" REF="028343_0198_0FD8AD20A0313600">
error; and that, led a&s;tray by the prejudices of their educations, a great number of Frenchmen look upon this form of government as a &s;tate perpetually in a ferment, wherein life and property are continually expo&s;ed to the greate&s;t dangers.</P>
<P>The&s;e prejudices lead to the belief of the mo&s;t puerile and ab&s;urd fables. The lea&s;t attention is not paid to circum&s;tances. Would the United States have a Congre&s;s of magi&s;trates if it we<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> true that the people were at war with them? For how could Congre&s;s and the magi&s;trates defend them&s;elves? They have no other defence but the re&s;pect which each individual has for the law, this is their only force. It is the obligation that the con&s;titution im|po&s;es on them, in common with the meane&s;t citi|zens, of being obedien<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to the law, as the la&s;t means which con&s;titute their only &s;afety, and which maintains, in all ca&s;es and every where, the authority which the people have confided in them. They cannot employ a phy&s;ical force farther than the peo|ple are willing to lend them, becau&s;e they have nei|ther an army nor &s;oldiers in pay.</P>
<P>A diver&s;ity of opinion exi&s;ts wherever there are men. It belongs not to one con&s;titutions more than to another; but the e&s;&s;ence of a republican govern|ment is to leave to each individual the liberty of ex|pre&s;&s;ing his &s;entiments on every &s;ubject.</P>
<P>In the United States, legi&s;lation is more and more formed in proportion as things relative to each other are verified, extended, and multiplied. Is it a&s;to|ni&s;hing that debates &s;hould ari&s;e on account of the different laws which are propo&s;ed, di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, and adopted? The&s;e debates become public, animate conver&s;ation, and make it highly intere&s;ting. But is this anarchy?</P>
<P>The word <HI>anarchy</HI> is one of tho&s;e words which has been mo&s;t abu&s;ed and mi&s;applied. It is there|fore nece&s;&s;ary to explain it.</P>
<P><PB N="165" REF="028343_0199_0FD8AD224222E000">Where anarchy reigns, there is neither chief, go|vernment, laws, nor &s;afety. Each individual be|comes the defender of his own per&s;on, the &s;ocial contract is broken, and there is no longer any con|fidence or tran&s;actions, becau&s;e there can be no more contracts. Authority, changing at every in|&s;tant its rules, principles, and aim, becomes cruel or contemptible; it de&s;troys, or is de&s;troyed. Such a &s;tare exi&s;ts not long; or if it does exi&s;t, it &s;oon di|vides &s;ociety into armed herds, enemies to each other, and which &s;ub&s;i&s;t but in proportion as they fear and counterbalance each other's power.</P>
<P>Is any thing like this &s;een in the United States? Are there di&s;putes even about the principles of the con&s;titution, the fundamental laws, or the propo&s;ed end? Has not every thing relative to this been long &s;ince agreed upon? The pre&s;ent debates relate wholly to &s;ome rules of admini&s;tration: it is upon the be&s;t manner of &s;erving the public cau&s;e, and of &s;upporting it, that minds are &s;till in a &s;alutary agita|tion; and this agitation hinders not more the regular cour&s;e of public affairs and tran&s;actions, than the debates in the Engli&s;h Parliament hinder the mo|narch from naming to offices and conferring rank&mdash; than they &s;top the cour&s;e of ju&s;tice, or are impedi|ments to the affairs of every cla&s;s of citizens.</P>
<P>The word <HI>anarchy</HI> is proper to &s;tates which, like Egypt, have twenty-four &s;overeigns, and neither laws nor government. It is applicable to the dege|nerated con&s;titutions of A&s;ia, where the admini&s;tra|tion is divided into &s;everal departments, independent of each other, traver&s;ing one another in their views and preten&s;ions, the operations of one part interfer|ing with tho&s;e of the other, all having the power of making particular laws, or of &s;u&s;pending the effect of tho&s;e which exi&s;t. There a real anarchy reigns, becau&s;e it is not known where the government is, nor in whom the legi&s;lative power is ve&s;ted. This
<PB N="166" REF="028343_0200_0FD8AD23CB858620">
incertitude brings on di&s;order, renders property un|&s;table, and endangers per&s;onal &s;afety.</P>
<P>None of the&s;e evils exi&s;t in the United States. America is not yet gnawed by the vermin which devour Europe, by inde&s;tructible mendicity: thieves render not her fore&s;ts dangerous; her public roads are not &s;tained with blood &s;hed by a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins. How &s;hould there be a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins and robbers? There are no beggars, no indigent per&s;ons, no &s;ubjects forced to &s;teal the &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of others to procure one to them|&s;elves. Every man finds there lands to produce him articles of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence: it is not loaded with taxes, but renders to each, with u&s;ury, a recompen&s;e for his labour. A man who can live ea&s;y and honour|ably, never con&s;ents to di&s;honour him&s;elf by u&s;ele&s;s crimes, which deliver him to the torments of remor&s;e, di&s;honour, and the vengeance of &s;ociety.</P>
<P>The ravages of the &s;even years war were undoubt|edly terrible; but as &s;oon as the faulchion could be converted into a p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ough-&s;hare, the land became fer|tile, and mi&s;ery di&s;appeared. The American &s;oldiers were citizens; and they were al&s;o proprietors before they became &s;oldiers; they remained citizens in uni|form, and returned to their profe&s;&s;ions on quitting it: they did not fight for money, nor by profe&s;&s;ion, but for their liberty, their wives, child<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">en, and pro|perty; and &s;uch &s;oldiers never re&s;embled the banditti of the old continent, who are paid for killing their fellow-creatures, and who kill on the highways fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> their own account, when peace obliges their ma&s;ters to di&s;band them. There has been &s;een in America (what the annals of the world pre&s;ent not in any &s;tate, except that of Rome) a General, adored by his &s;oldiers, dive&s;t him&s;elf of his power as &s;oon as his &s;ervices became no longer nece&s;&s;ary, and retire into the bo&s;om of peace and ob&s;curity: a numerous ar|my, which was not paid, was &s;een generou&s;ly to con|&s;ent to di&s;band without payment; the &s;oldiers to re|tire,

each to his home, without committing the lea&s;t di&s;order, and where each tranquilly retook either his plough, or his fir&s;t trade or profe&s;&s;ion; tho&s;e trades which we in Europe look upon as vi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e.</P>
<P>The following adverti&s;ement is taken from the American papers, in which there are a thou&s;and others of a like nature.</P>
<P>Two brothers, Captains who di&s;tingui&s;hed them|&s;elves during the war, returned at the peace to their trade of hat-making;&mdash;they in&s;erted in the gazette an adverti&s;ement as follows:</P>
<P><Q>The brothers <HI>Bickers</HI> inform the public, that they are returned to their old profe&s;&s;ion of hatters, which they had abandoned to defend the liberty of their country. They hope that their fellow-ci|tizens will be plea&s;ed, in con&s;ideration of their courage and &s;ervices, to favour them in their bu|&s;ine&s;s, and pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">fer them to others.</Q>
What Euro|pean Captain would put his name to a like adverti&s;e|ment?</P>
<P>This is what re&s;ults from liberty: but what is in|conceivable in mo&s;t European &s;tates, a military &s;pi|rit reigns there, and its prejudices are predominant. War is the road to glory, ambition, and fortune; and to pre&s;erve t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> this profe&s;&s;ion its lu&s;tre and prepon|derance, it is an e&s;tabli&s;hed principle, that a <HI>&s;tanding army</HI> is nece&s;&s;ary to maintain order in &s;ociety; that it ought always to threaten the citizens, although peaceful, to keep them in &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to authority. This u&s;ele&s;s burden, this pernicious &s;pirit, is un|known to the United States;&mdash;public &s;pirit, much more favourable to good order, takes its place, and peace and &s;afety reign without marechau&s;&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;pies, or that police which di&s;parages the morals and cha|racters of citizens. Public &s;pirit &s;upplies the place of all the&s;e means, whil&s;t they will never &s;upply the want of public &s;pirit; nor, like it, produce the hap|pine&s;s of &s;ociety.</P>
<P><PB N="168" REF="028343_0202_0FD8AD275FD62198">In vain will prejudiced men exclaim, that this is declamation&mdash;I offer them facts. It is nece&s;&s;ary to read the American gazettes&mdash;not tho&s;e altered by the Engli&s;h gazette-writers, but tho&s;e which are printed in America: the&s;e only can give a ju&s;t idea of the &s;ituation of the United States.</P>
<P>The American &s;hould rather de&s;pi&s;e Europe, in remarking to us the continual &s;laughter we make of thieves and a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins; in comparing the immen&s;e number of dungeons, pri&s;ons, ho&s;pitals, and e&s;tab|li&s;hments of every kind, in&s;tituted to cure or palliate the incurable ulcers of the old in&s;titutions: in com|paring this di&s;gu&s;ting li&s;t with the very few murders and thefts committed in the United States, with the ho&s;pitals, truly <HI>dome&s;tic</HI> and humane, which are e&s;tab|li&s;hed there, with the happine&s;s of each American family and their &s;imple manners; and in proving to us, by their example, that a wi&s;e liberty regulates the &s;ocial man, and renders u&s;ele&s;s tho&s;e ruinous ma|chines with which he is cru&s;hed, le&s;t he &s;hould do any harm.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the men, the laws, and the govern|ment, which Europeans have calumniated. The&s;e men who are de&s;tined to regenerate the dignity of the human &s;pecies!&mdash;The&s;e laws which &s;courge no|thing but crimes,&mdash;which puni&s;h them every where, and are never &s;ilent in the face of power!&mdash;This go|vernment, which is the fir&s;t that ever pre&s;ented the image of a numerous family, well united, and com|pletely happy; wherein power is ju&s;t, becau&s;e it circu|lates through every hand, and re&s;ts in none; where|in obedience, becau&s;e it is voluntary, anticipates command; wherein admini&s;tration is &s;imple and ea&s;y; becau&s;e it leaves indu&s;try to it&s;elf; wherein the ma|gi&s;trate has little to do, becau&s;e the citizen is free, and that a citizen always re&s;pects the law and his fellow creatures! The&s;e are the prodigies which we calumniate: we, Europeans, en&s;laved by antiquated

con&s;titutions, and by the habitudes given to us by prejudices, of which we know not either the barba|rity or the frivolou&s;ne&s;s! We &s;peak well, but act badly; why, therefore, do we calumniate men, who not only &s;peak but act well? If it be not permitted us to have their virtues, nor to enjoy their happi|ne&s;s, let us not decry them; let us re&s;pect that &s;u|periority to which we cannot attain.</P>
<P>It will, perhaps, be objected, that the government of England has deferred the conclu&s;ion of a treaty of commerce with the United States, under the pre|text that their con&s;titutions were not yet &s;ufficiently e&s;tabli&s;hed.

<P>It cannot be doubted that the difference of po&s;ition between the French and Engli&s;h merchants, re&s;pect|ing their governments, has a great influence upon their reciprocal pro&s;perity; and for this rea&s;on, it &s;hould be ince&s;&s;antly repeated to the French govern|ment, that if it wi&s;hes to in&s;ure pro&s;perity to its com|merce, it ought to adopt the means, which are, <HI>liberty of acting,&mdash;the right of prote&s;ting again&s;t the attempts made on that liberty,&mdash;and the certainty of ju&s;tice,&mdash; without re&s;pect to per&s;ons:</HI>&mdash;the&s;e are the ba&s;is of the genius, indu&s;try, and greatne&s;s of a &s;tate; and with|out which, a great commerce cannot exi&s;t: this ba&s;is may be ea&s;ily conciliated with the French con&s;titu|tion.</P>

<P>For people increa&s;e in proportion to the number of marriages, and that is greater in proportion to the ea&s;e and convenience of &s;upporting a family. When families can be ea&s;ily &s;uppo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ed, more per|&s;ons marry, and earlier in life.</P>
<P><PB N="177" REF="028343_0209_0FD8AD3B29D23510">In cities, where all trades, occupations, and of|fices are full, many delay until they can &s;ee how to bear the charges of a family; which charges are greater in cities, as luxury is more common; many live &s;ingle during life, and continue &s;ervants to fa|milies, journeymen to trades, &amp;c. hence cities do not by natural generation &s;upply them&s;elves with inhabitants; the deaths are more than the births.</P>
<P>In countries full &s;ettled the ca&s;e mu&s;t be nearly the &s;ame; all lands being occupied and improved to the height, tho&s;e who cannot get land mu&s;t labour for tho&s;e who have it; when labourers are plenty, their wages will be low; by low wages a family is &s;upported with difficulty; this difficulty deters many from marriage, who therefore long continue &s;ervants and &s;ingle. Only as cities take &s;upplies of people from the country, and thereby make a little more room in the country, marriage is a little more en|couraged there, and the births exceed the deaths.</P>
<P>Great part of Europe is full &s;ettled with hu&s;band|men, manufacturers, &amp;c. and therefore cannot now much increa&s;e in people. Land being plenty in America, and &s;o cheap as that a labouring man, who under&s;tands hu&s;bandry, can in a &s;hort time &s;ave money enough to purcha&s;e a piece of new land &s;uf|ficient for a plantation, whereon he may &s;ub&s;i&s;t a family, &s;uch are not afraid to marry; for even if they look far enough forward to con&s;ider how their children, when grown, are to be provided for, they &s;ee that more land is to be had at rates equally ea&s;y, all circum&s;tances con&s;idered.</P>
<P>Hence marriages in America are more general, and more generally early, than in Europe. And if it is reckoned there, that there is but one marriage per annum among one hundred per&s;ons, perhaps we may here reckon two; and if in Europe they have but four births to a marriage (many of their marri|ages being late) we may here reckon eight; of which,
<PB N="178" REF="028343_0210_0FD8AD3C98580A58">
if one half grow up, and our marriages are made, <HI>reckoning one with another, at twenty years of age, our people mu&s;t at lea&s;t he doubled every twenty years.</HI></P>
<P>But notwith&s;tanding this increa&s;e, &s;o va&s;t is the territory of North America, that it will require many ages to &s;ettle it fully; and until it is fully &s;et|tled, labour will never be cheap here, where no man continues long a labourer for others, but gets a plan|tation of his own; no man continues long a jour|neyman to a trade, but goes among the&s;e new &s;et|tlers, and &s;ets up for him&s;elf, &amp;c. Hence labour is no cheaper now in Penn&s;ylvania than it was thirty years ago, though &s;o many thou&s;and labouring peo|ple have been imported from Germany and Ireland.</P>
<P>In proportion to the increa&s;e of the colonies, a va&s;t demand is growing for Briti&s;h manufactures; a glorious market wholly in the power of Britain, in which foreigners cannot interfere, which will in|crea&s;e in a &s;hort time even beyond her power of &s;upplying, though her whole trade &s;hould be to her colonies.</P>

<HEAD>Of the We&s;tern Territory.</HEAD>
<P>It is a mi&s;take in tho&s;e who imagine that the new &s;tate of Kentucky compri&s;es the We&s;tern Territory of North-America. That new &s;tate includes but a &s;mall part of this great domain. The &s;tate of Kentucky is de&s;cribed to be bounded on the &s;outh by North-Carolina, on the north by Sandy creek, on the we&s;t by Cumberland river, making about two hundred and fifty miles in length, and two hun|dred miles in breadth; whereas the whole We&s;tern Territory is infinitely more exten&s;ive. The limits are unknown; but that part of it which was &s;ur|veyed by Captain Hutchins, geographer to the Con|gre&s;s, he has given us a &s;hort account of. From his
<PB N="179" REF="028343_0211_0FD8AD41A2CC6E98">
account, becau&s;e it is known to be authentic, we have extracted the following.</P>
<P>The part he &s;urveyed lies between the 33d and 45th degrees of latitude, and the 78th and 94th de|grees of longitude, containing an extent of terri|tory, which, for healthfulne&s;s, fertility of &s;oil, and variety of productions, is not perhaps &s;urpa&s;&s;ed by any on the habitable globe.</P>
<P>"The lands comprehended between the river Ohio, at Fort-Pitt, and the Laurel mountain, and thence continuing the &s;ame breadth from Fort-Pitt to the Great Kanhawa river, may, according to my own ob&s;ervations, and tho&s;e of the late Mr. Gi&s;t, of Virginia, be generally, and ju&s;tly de&s;cribed as follows.</P>
<P>"The vallies adjoining to the branches or &s;prings of the middle f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rks of Youghiogeny, are narrow towards its &s;ource; but there <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> a con&s;iderable quan|tity of good farming grounds on the hills, near the large&s;t branch of that river. The lands within a &s;mall di&s;tance of the Laurel mountain (through which the Youg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">iogeny runs) are in many places broken and &s;tony, but rich and well timbered; and in &s;ome places, and particularly on Laurel creek, they are rocky and mountainous.</P>
<P>"From the Laurel mountain to Monongahela, the fir&s;t &s;even miles are good, level farming grounds, with fine meadows; the timber, white oak, che&s;nut, hickory, &amp;c. The &s;ame kind of land continues &s;outherly (twelve miles) to the upper branches or forks of this river, and about fifteen miles northerly to the place where the Youghiogeny falls into the Monongahela. The lands, for about eighteen miles in the &s;ame cour&s;e of the la&s;t-mentioned river, on each &s;ide of it, though hilly, are rich and well tim|bered. The trees are walnut, locu&s;t, che&s;nut, pop|lar, and &s;ugar or &s;weet maple. The low lands, near the river, are about a mile, and in &s;everal places
<PB N="180" REF="028343_0212_0FD8AD4339F138B0">
two miles wide. For a con&s;iderable way down the river, on the ea&s;tern &s;ide of it, the intervals are ex|tremely rich, and about a mile wide. The upland for about twelve miles ea&s;twardly, are uncommonly fertile, and well timbered; the low lands, on the we&s;tern &s;ide, are narrow; but the uplands, on the ea&s;tern &s;ide of the river, both up and down, are ex|cellent, and covered with &s;ugar trees, &amp;c.</P>
<P>"Such parts of the country which lie on &s;ome of the branches of the Monongahela, and acro&s;s the heads of &s;everal rivers that run into the Ohio, though in general hilly, are exceedingly fruitful and well watered. The timber is walnut, che&s;nut, a&s;h, oak, &s;ugar trees, &amp;c. and the interval or meadow lands are from two hundred and fifty yards to a quarter of a mile wide.</P>
<P>"The lands lying nearly in a north-we&s;terly di|rection from the Great Kanhawa river to the Ohio, and thence north-ea&s;terly, and al&s;o upon Le Tort's creek, Little Kanhawa river, Buffaloe, Fi&s;hing, Weeling, and the two upper, and two lower, and &s;everal other very con&s;iderable creeks, (or what, in Europe, would be called large rivers) and thence ea&s;t, and &s;outh-ea&s;t to the river Monongahela, are, in point of quality, as follows.</P>
<P>"The borders or meadow lands are a mile, and in &s;ome places near two miles wide; and the uplands are in common of a mo&s;t fertile &s;oil, capable of abundantly producing wheat, hemp, flax, &amp;c.</P>
<P>"The lands which lie upon the Ohio, at the mouths of, and between the above creeks, al&s;o con|&s;i&s;t of rich intervals and very fine farming grounds. The whole country abounds in bears, elks, buffaloe, deer, turkies, &amp;c. An unque&s;tionable proof of the extraordinary goodne&s;s of its &s;oil! Indiana lies within the territory here de&s;cribed. It contains about three millions and an half of acres, and was granted to Samuel Wharton, William Trent, and

<P>"Fort-Pitt &s;tands at the confluence of the Alleg|heny and Monongahela rivers; in latitude 40&deg; 31&prime; 44&Prime;, and about five degrees we&s;tward of Philadel|phia. In the year 1760, a &s;mall town, called Pitt&s;|burgh, was built near Fort-Pitt, and about two hundred families re&s;ided in it; but upon the Indian war breaking out (in the month of May, 1763) they abandoned their hou&s;es, and retired into the fort.</P>
<P>"In the year 1765 the pre&s;ent town of Pitt&s;burgh was laid out. It is built on the ea&s;tern bank of the river Monongahela, about two hundred yards from Fort-Pitt.</P>
<P>"The junction of the Allegheny and Mononga|hela rivers forms the river Ohio, and this di&s;charges it&s;elf into the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi, (in latitude 36&deg; 43&prime;) about one thou&s;and one hundred and eighty-eight com|puted miles from Fort-Pitt. The Ohio, in its pa&s;|&s;age to the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi, glides through a plea&s;ant, fruitful, and healthy country, and carries a great uniformity of breadth, from four hundred to &s;ix hundred yards, except at its confluence with the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi, and for one hundred miles above it, where it is one thou&s;and yards wide. The Ohio, for the greater part of the way to the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi, has many meanders, or windings, and ri&s;ing grounds upon both &s;ides of it.</P>
<P>"The reaches in the Ohio are in &s;ome parts from two to four miles in length, and one of them, above the Mu&s;kingum river, called the Long Reach, is &s;ixteen miles and an half long. The Ohio, about 100 miles above, or northerly of the Rapids, (for|merly called the Falls) is in many places 700 yards wide; and as it approaches them, the high grounds on its borders gradually dimini&s;h, and the country becomes more level. Some of the banks, or heights
<PB N="182" REF="028343_0214_0FD8AD4643F13760">
of this river, are at times overflowed by great fre&s;hes; yet there is &s;carce a place between Fort-Pitt and the Rapids, (a di&s;tance of 705 computed miles) where a good road may not be made; and hor&s;es employ|ed in drawing up large barges (as is done on the mar|gin of the river Thames in England, and the Seine in France) again&s;t a &s;tream remarkably gentle, ex|cept in high fre&s;hes. The heights of the banks of the Ohio admit them every where to be &s;ettled, as they are not liable to crumble away.</P>
<P>"To the&s;e remarks it may be proper to add the following ob&s;ervations of the ingenious Mr. Lewis Evans. He &s;ays, that 'the Ohio river, as the win|ter &s;nows are thawed by the warmth or rains in the &s;pring, ri&s;es in va&s;t floods, in &s;ome places exceeding twenty feet in height, but &s;carce any where over|flowing its high and upright banks. The&s;e floods,' Mr. Evans adds, 'continue of &s;ome height for at lea&s;t a month or two, according to the late or early breaking up of the winter. Ve&s;&s;els from 100 to 200 tons burthen, by taking the advantage of the&s;e floods, may go from Pitt&s;burgh to the &s;ea with &s;afety, as then the falls, rifts, and &s;hoals, are covered to an e|quality with the re&s;t of the rivers;'&mdash;and though the di&s;tance is upwards of 2000 miles from Fort-Pitt to the &s;ea, yet as there are no ob&s;tructions to prevent ve&s;&s;els from proceeding both day and night, I am per&s;uaded that this extraordinary inland voyage may be performed, during the &s;ea&s;on of the floods, by rowing, in &s;ixteen or &s;eventeen days.</P>
<P>"The navigation of the Ohio in a dry &s;ea&s;on, is rather trouble&s;ome from Fort-Pitt to the Mingo town (about 75 miles) but from thence to the Mi&s;|&s;i&s;&s;ippi there is always a &s;ufficient depth of water for barges, carrying from 100 to 200 tons burthen, built in the manner as tho&s;e are which are u&s;ed on the ri|ver Thames, between London and Oxford;&mdash;to wit, from 100 to 120 feet in the keel, &s;ixteen to eighteen
<PB N="183" REF="028343_0215_0FD8AD47CB540640">
feet in breadth, and four feet in depth, and when loaded, drawing about three feet water.</P>
<P>"The Rapids, in a dry &s;ea&s;on, are difficult to de|&s;cend with loaded boats or barges.</P>
<P>[But in&s;tead of the carrying place now u&s;ed, it is intended to &s;ub&s;titute a canal on the contrary &s;ide of the river.]</P>
<P>"Mo&s;t of the hills on both &s;ides of the Ohio are filled with excellent coal, and a coal mine was in the year 1760, opened oppo&s;ite to Fort-Pitt, on the river Monongahela, for the u&s;e of that garri&s;on. Salt &s;prings, as well as iron ore, and rich lead mines, are found bordering upon the river Ohio. One of the latter is opened on a branch of the Scioto river, and there the Indian natives &s;upply them&s;elves with a con&s;iderable part of the lead which they u&s;e in their wars and hunting.</P>
<P>"About 584 miles below Fort-Pitt, and on the ea&s;tern &s;ide of the Ohio river, about three miles from it, at the head of a &s;mall creek or run, where are &s;e|veral large and miry &s;alt &s;prings, are found numbers of large bones, teeth, and tu&s;ks, commonly &s;uppo&s;ed to be tho&s;e of elephants:&mdash;but the celebrated Doctor Hunter of London, in his ingenious and curious ob&s;ervations on the&s;e bones, &amp;c. has &s;uppo&s;ed them to belong to &s;ome carnivorous animal, larger than an ordinary elephant.</P>
<P>"On the north-we&s;tern &s;ide of Ohio, about eleven miles below the Cherokee-river, on a high bank, are the remains of Fort-Ma&s;&s;ac, built by the French, and intended as a check to the &s;outhern Indians. It was de&s;troyed by them in the year 1763. This is a high, healthy, and delightful &s;ituation. A great va|riety of game, buffaloe, bear, deer, &amp;c. as well as ducks, gee&s;e, &s;wans, turkies, phea&s;ants, patridges, &amp;c. abounds in every part of this country.</P>
<P>"The Ohio, and the rivers emptying into it, af|ford green and other turtle, and fi&s;h of various

&s;orts; particularly carp, &s;turgeon, perch, and cats; the two latter of an uncommon &s;ize, viz. perch from eight to twelve pounds weight, and cats from fifty to one hundred pounds weight.</P>
<P>"The lands upon the Ohio, and its branches, are differently timbered according to their quality and &s;ituation. The high and dry lands are covered with red, white and black oak, hickory, walnut, red and white mulberry and a&s;h trees, grape-vines, &amp;c. the low and meadow lands are filled with &s;ycamore, poplar, red and white mulberry, cherry, beach, elm, a&s;pen, maple, or &s;ugar trees, grape-vines, &amp;c. and below, or &s;outhwardly of the Rapids, are &s;everal large cedar and cypre&s;s &s;wamps, where the cedar and cypre&s;s trees grow to a remarkable &s;ize, and where al&s;o is a great abundance of canes, &s;uch as grow in South-Carolina. The country on both &s;ides of the Ohio, extending &s;outh-ea&s;terly, and &s;outh-we&s;terly from Fort-Pitt to the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi, and water|ed by the Ohio river, and its branches, contains at lea&s;t a million of &s;quare miles, and it may, with truth, be affirmed, that no part of the globe is ble&s;&s;ed with a more healthful air, or climate; watered with more navigable rivers and branches communicating with the Atlantic Ocean, by the rivers Potowmack, James, Rappahannock, Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi, and St. Law|rence, or capable of producing, with le&s;s labour and expence, wheat, Indian corn, buck-wheat, rye, oats, barley, flax, hemp, tobacco, rice, &s;ilk, pot-a&s;h, &amp;c. than the country under con&s;ideration. And although there are con&s;iderable quantities of high lands for about 250 miles (on both &s;ides of the river Ohio) &s;outhwardly from Fort-Pitt, yet even the &s;ummits of mo&s;t of the hills are covered with a deep rich &s;oil, fit for the culture of flax and hemp; and it may al&s;o be added, that no &s;oil can po&s;&s;ibly yield larger crops of red and white clover, and other u&s;eful gra&s;s, than this does.</P>
<P><PB N="185" REF="028343_0217_0FD8AD4CF53CB920">"On the north-we&s;t and &s;outh-ea&s;t &s;ides of the Ohio, below the great Kanhawa river, at a little di&s;|tance from it, are exten&s;ive natural meadows, or &s;a|vannahs. The&s;e meadows are from 20 to 50 miles in circuit. They have many beautiful groves of trees inter&s;per&s;ed, as if by art, in them, and which &s;erve as a &s;helter for the innumerable herds of buffa|loe, deer, &amp;c. with which they abound.</P>
<P>"I am obliged to a worthy friend and country|man for the following ju&s;t and judicious ob&s;erva|tions. They were addre&s;&s;ed to the Earl of Hill&s;bo|rough, in the year 1770, when &s;ecretary of &s;tate for the North-American department; and were written by Mr. Samuel Wharton of Philadelphia, who at that time re&s;ided in London, having &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s there with Mr. Strahan, Mr. Almon, &amp;c.</P>
<P>"No part of North-America," he &s;ays, "will re|quire le&s;s encouragement for the production of na|val &s;tores, and raw materials for manufactories in Europe, and for &s;upplying the We&s;t-India i&s;lands with lumber, provi&s;ions, &amp;c. than the country of the Ohio;&mdash;and for the following rea&s;ons:&mdash;</P>
<P>"Fir&s;t, The lands are excellent, the climate tem|perate, the native grapes, &s;ilk worms, and mulberry trees, abound every where: hemp, hops, and rye, grow &s;pontaneou&s;ly in the vallies and low lands; lead and iron ore are plenty in the hills; &s;alt &s;prings are innumerable; and no &s;oil is better adapted to the cul|ture of tobacco, flax, and cotton, than that of the Ohio.</P>
<P>"Second, The country is well watered by &s;everal navigable rivers, communicating with each other; by which, and a &s;hort land carriage, the produce of the lands of the Ohio can, even now (in the year 1772) be &s;ent cheaper to the &s;ea-port town of Alexandria, on the river Potowmack in Virginia (where General Brad|dock's tran&s;ports landed his troops,) than any kind of merchandize is &s;ent from Northampton to London.</P>
<P><PB N="186" REF="028343_0218_0FD8AD500087C5D0">"Third, The river Ohio is, at all &s;ea&s;ons of the year, navigable with large boats, like the we&s;t coun|try barges, rowed only by four or five men; and from the month of February to April large &s;hips may be built on the Ohio, and &s;ent to &s;ea laden with hemp, iron, flax, &s;ilk, tobacco, cotton, pot-a&s;h, &amp;c.</P>
<P>"Fourth, Flour, corn, beef, &s;hip-plank, and other u&s;eful articles, can be &s;ent down the &s;tream of the Ohio to We&s;t-Florida, and from thence to the We&s;t-India i&s;lands, much cheaper, and in better order, than from New-York or Philadelphia to the&s;e i&s;lands.</P>
<P>"Fifth, Hemp, tobacco, iron, and &s;uch bulky ar|ticles, may al&s;o be &s;ent down the &s;tream of the Ohio to the &s;ea, and at lea&s;t 50 per cent. cheaper than the&s;e articles were ever carried by land carriage, of only 60 miles, in Penn&s;ylvania: where waggonage is cheaper than in any other part of North-America.</P>
<P>"Sixth, The expence of tran&s;porting European manufactories from the &s;ea to the Ohio, will not be &s;o much as is now paid, and mu&s;t ever be paid, to a great part of the counties of Penn&s;ylvania, Virginia, and Maryland. Whenever the farmers or merchants of Ohio &s;hall properly under&s;tand the bu&s;ine&s;s of tran&s;portation, they will build &s;chooners, &s;loops, &amp;c. on the Ohio, &s;uitable for the We&s;t-India, or Euro|pean markets; or, by having black-walnut, cherry-tree, oak, &amp;c. properly &s;awed for foreign markets, and formed into rafts, in the manner that is now done by the &s;ettlers near the upper parts of Dela|ware river in Penn&s;ylvania, and thereon &s;tow their hemp, iron, tobacco, &amp;c. and proceed with them to New-Orleans.</P>
<P>"It may not, perhaps, be ami&s;s, to ob&s;erve, that large quantities of flour are made in the di&s;tant (we&s;|tern) counties of Penn&s;ylvania, and &s;ent by an ex|pen&s;ive land carriage to the city of Philadelphia, and from thence &s;hipped to South-Carolina and to Ea&s;t and We&s;t Florida, there being little or no wheat

The river Ohio &s;eems kindly de&s;igned by nature as the channel through which the two Floridas may be &s;upplied with flour, not only for their own con&s;umption, but al&s;o for the carrying on an exten&s;ive commerce with Jamaica and the Spani&s;h &s;ettlements in the Bay of Mexico. Mill&s;tones in abundance are to be obtained in the hills near the Ohio, and the country is every where well watered with large and con&s;tant &s;prings and &s;treams, for gri&s;t and other mills.</P>
<P>"The pa&s;&s;age from Philadelphia to Pen&s;acola is &s;eldom made in le&s;s than a month, and &s;ixty &s;hil|lings &s;terling per ton freight (con&s;i&s;ting of &s;ixteen bar|rels) is u&s;ually paid for flour, &amp;c. thither. Boats carrying 800 or 1000 barrels of flour, may go in about the &s;ame time from the Ohio (even from Pitt&s;|burgh) as from Philadelphia to Pen&s;acola; and for half the above freight the Ohio merchants would be able to deliver flour, &amp;c. there in much better order than from Philadelphia, and without incurring the damage and delay of the &s;ea, and charges of in&s;ur|ance, &amp;c. as from thence to Pen&s;acola.</P>
<P>"This is not mere &s;peculation; for it is a fact, that about the year 1746, there was a great &s;carcity of provi&s;ions at New-Orleans, and the French &s;et|tlements, at the Illinois, &s;mall as they then were, &s;ent thither in one winter, upwards of eight hundred thou|&s;and weight of flour."</P>
<P>"I &s;hall now proceed to give a brief account of the &s;everal rivers and creeks which fall into the river Ohio.</P>
<P>"Canawagy, when rai&s;ed by fre&s;hes, is pa&s;&s;able with &s;mall batteaux, to a little lake at its head;&mdash;from thence there is a portage of twenty miles to lake Erie, at the mouth of Jad&aacute;ghque. The portage is &s;eldom u&s;ed, becau&s;e Canawagy has &s;carcely any wa|ter in it in a dry &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P><PB N="188" REF="028343_0220_0FD8AD52E7368B30">"Bughaloons is not navigable, but is remarkable for exten&s;ive meadows bordering upon it.</P>
<P>"French Creek affords the neare&s;t pa&s;&s;age to lake Erie. It is navigable with &s;mall boats to Le Beuf, by a very crooked channel; the portage thence to Pre&s;quile, from an adjoining penin&s;ula, is 15 miles. This is the u&s;ual route from Quebec to Ohio.</P>
<P>"Licking and Lacomic Creeks do not afford any navigation; but there is plenty of coals and &s;tones for building in the hills which adjoin them.</P>
<P>"Toby's Creek is deep enough for batteaux for a con&s;iderable way up, thence by a &s;hort portage to the we&s;t branch of Su&s;quehannah, a good communica|tion is carried on between Ohio and the ea&s;tern parts of Penn&s;ylvania.</P>
<P>"Moghulbughkitum is pa&s;&s;able al&s;o by flat bot|tom boats in the &s;ame manner as Toby's Creek is to Su&s;quehannah, and from thence to all the &s;ettlements. in Northumberland county, &amp;c. in Penn&s;ylvania.</P>
<P>"Ki&s;hkeminetas is navigable in like manner as the preceding creeks, for between 40 and 50 miles, and good portages are found between Ki&s;hkeminetas, Ju|niat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a, and Potowmack rivers.&mdash;Coal and &s;alt are di&s;covered in the neighbourhood of the&s;e rivers.</P>
<P>"Monongahela is a large river, and at its junc|tion with the Allegheny river, &s;tands Fort-Pitt. It is deep, and gentle, and navigable with batteaux and barges, beyond Red-Stone creek, and &s;till farther with lighter craft. At &s;ixteen miles from its mouth is Youghiogeny; this river is navigable with batteaux or barges, to the foot of Laurel-hill.</P>
<P>"Beaver Creek has water &s;ufficient for flat bot|tom boats. At Ki&s;hku&s;kes, (about 16 miles up) are two branches of this creek, which &s;pread oppo&s;ite ways; one interlocks with French Creek and Che|r&acirc;ge,&mdash;the other with Mu&s;kingum and Cayahoga; on this branch, about thirty-five miles above the
<PB N="189" REF="028343_0221_0FD8AD545FB57E20">
forks, are many &s;alt-&s;prings.&mdash;Cayahoga is practi|cable with canoes about twenty miles farther.</P>
<P>"Mu&s;kingum is a fine gentle river, confined by high banks, which prevent its floods from overflow|ing the &s;urrounding land. It is 250 yards wide at its confluence with the Ohio, and navigable, with|out any ob&s;tructions, by large batteaux or barges, to the Three Legs, and by &s;mall ones to a little lake at its head.</P>
<P>"From thence to Cayahoga (the creek that leads to lake Erie) the Mu&s;kingum is muddy, and not very &s;wift, but no where ob&s;tructed with falls or rifts. Here are fine uplands, exten&s;ive meadows, oak and mulberry trees fit for &s;hip-building, and walnut, che&s;|nut, and poplar trees, &s;uitable for dome&s;tic &s;ervices. &mdash;Cayahoga furni&s;hes the be&s;t portage between Ohio and lake Erie; at its mouth it is wide and deep enough to receive large &s;loops from the lake. It will hereafter be a place of great importance.</P>
<P>"Mu&s;kingum, in all its wide-extended branches, is &s;urrounded by mo&s;t excellent land, and abounds in &s;prings, and conveniencies particularly adapted to &s;ettlements remote from &s;ea navigations;&mdash;&s;uch as &s;alt &s;prings, coal, clay, and free &s;tone. In 1784 a coal mine oppo&s;ite to Lamen&s;hicola mouth took fire, and continued burning about twelve months, but great quantities of coal &s;till remain in it. Near the &s;ame place are excellent whet&s;tones, and about eight miles higher up the river, is plenty of white and blue clay for gla&s;s works and pottery.</P>
<P>"Hockhocking is navigable with large flat bot|tom boats between &s;eventy and eighty miles; it has fine meadows with high banks, which &s;eldom over|flow, and rich uplands on its borders. Coal and quarries of free-&s;tone are found about 15 miles up this creek.</P>
<P>"Big Kanhawa falls into the Ohio upon its &s;outh-ea&s;tern &s;ide, and is &s;o con&s;iderable a branch of this

river, that it may be mi&s;taken for the Ohio it&s;elf by per&s;ons a&s;cending it. It is &s;low for ten miles, to lit|tle broken hills,&mdash;the low land is very rich, and of about the &s;ame breadth, (from the pipe hills to the falls) as upon the Ohio. After going ten miles up Kanhawa, the land is hilly, and the water a little rapid for 50 or 60 miles further to the falls, yet bat|teaux or barges m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y be ea&s;ily rowed thither. The&s;e falls were formerly thought impa&s;&s;able; but late di&s;|coveries have proved, that a waggon road may be made through the mountain, which occa&s;ions the falls, and that by a portage of a few miles only, a communication may be had between the waters of Great Kanhawa and Ohio, and tho&s;e of James river in Virginia.</P>
<P>"Tottery lies upon the &s;outh-ea&s;tern &s;ide of the Ohio, and is navigable with batteaux to the Oua&s;ioto mountains. It is a long river, has few branches, and interlocks with Red Creek, or Clinche's River (a branch of the Cuttawa;) and has below the moun|tains, e&s;pecially for 15 miles from its mouth, very good land. Here is a perceptible difference of cli|mate between the upper and this part of Ohio. Here the large reed, or Carolina cane, grows in plenty, even upon the upland, and the winter is &s;o moderate as not to de&s;troy it. The &s;ame moderation of cli|mate continues down Ohio, e&s;pecially on the &s;outh-ea&s;t &s;ide, to the rapids, and thence on both &s;ides of that river to the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi.</P>
<P>"Great Salt Lick Creek is remarkable for fine land, plenty of buffaloes, &s;alt &s;prings, white clay, and lime-&s;tone. Small boats may go to the cro&s;&s;ing of the war-path without any impediment. The &s;alt &s;prings render the waters unfit for drinking, but the plenty of fre&s;h &s;prings in their vicinity makes &s;uf|ficient amends for this inconvenience.</P>
<P>"Kentucky is larger than the preceding creek&punc; it is &s;urrounded with high clay banks, fertile lands,
<PB N="191" REF="028343_0223_0FD8AD5A5F7252D0">
and large &s;alt &s;prings. Its navigation is interrupted by &s;hoals, but pa&s;&s;able with &s;mall boats to the gap, where the war-path goes through the Oua&s;ioto mountains.</P>
<P>"Scioto is a large gentle river, bordered with rich flats, or meadows. It overflows in the &s;pring, and then &s;preads about half a mile, though when confined within its banks, it is &s;carce a furlong wide.</P>
<P>"If it floods early, it &s;eldom retires within its banks in le&s;s than a month, and is not fordable fre|quently in le&s;s than two months.</P>
<P>"The Scioto, be&s;ides having a great extent of mo&s;t excellent land on both &s;ides of the river, is furni&s;hed with &s;alt, on an ea&s;tern branch, and red bole on Necun&s;ia Skeintat. The &s;tream of Scioto is gentle and pa&s;&s;able, with large batteaux or barges, for a con&s;iderable way, and with &s;maller boats near 200 miles, to a portage of only four miles to San|du&s;ky.</P>
<P>"Sandu&s;ky is a con&s;iderable river abounding in level land; its &s;tream gentle all the way to the mouth, where it is large enough to receive &s;loops. The northern Indians cro&s;s Lake Erie here from i&s;land to i&s;land, land at Sandu&s;ky, and go by a direct path to the Lower Shawanoe town, and thence to the gap of the Oua&s;ioto mountain, in their way to the Cutta|wa country.</P>
<P>"Little Mineami river is too &s;mall to navigate with batteaux. It has much fine land and &s;everal &s;alt &s;prings; its high banks and gentle current pre|vent its much overflowing the &s;urrounding lands in fre&s;hes.</P>
<P>"Great Mineami, A&s;&s;ereniet or Rocky river, has a very &s;tony channel; a &s;wift &s;tream, but no falls. It has &s;everal large branches, pa&s;&s;able with boats a great way; one extending we&s;tward towards the Quiaghtena river, another towards a branch of Mi|neami river (which runs into Lake Erie,) to which
<PB N="192" REF="028343_0224_0FD8AD5CA0FF3460">
there is a portage, and a third has a portage to the we&s;t branch of Sandu&s;ky, be&s;ides Mad Creek, where the French formerly e&s;tabli&s;hed them&s;elves. Ri&s;ing ground, here and there a little &s;tony, begins in the northern part of the penin&s;ula, between the lakes Erie, Huron, and Michigan, and extends acro&s;s little Mineami river below the Forks, and &s;outhwardly along the Rocky river, to Ohio.</P>
<P>"Buffaloe river falls into the Ohio on the ea&s;tern &s;ide of it, at the di&s;tance of 925 computed miles from Fort-Pitt. It is a very con&s;iderable branch of the Ohio; is 200 yards wide, navigable upwards of 150 miles for batteaux or barges, of 30 feet long, five feet broad, and three feet deep, carrying about &s;even tons, and can be navigated much farther with large ca|noes. The &s;tream is moderate. The lands on both &s;ides of the river are of a mo&s;t luxuriant quality, for the production of hemp, flax, wheat, tobacco, &amp;c. They are covered with a great variety of lofty and u&s;eful timber; as oak, hickory, mulberry, elm, &amp;c. Several per&s;ons who have a&s;cended this river &s;ay, that &s;alt &s;prings, coal, lime, and free-&s;tone, &amp;c. are to be found in a variety of places.</P>

this is &s;ituated on a river of the &s;ame name, that runs into the &s;outh-&s;outh-we&s;t part of Lake Erie.&mdash; The &s;tream of the Waba&s;h is generally gentle to Fort-Ouiatanon, and no where ob&s;tructed with falls, but is by &s;everal rapids, both above and below that fort, &s;ome of which are pretty con&s;iderable. There is al&s;o a part of the river, for about three miles, and 30 miles from the carrying place, where the channel is &s;o narrow, that it is nece&s;&s;ary to make u&s;e of &s;et|ting poles in&s;tead of oars. The land on this river is remarkably fertile, and &s;everal parts of it are na|tural meadows, of great extent, covered with fine long gra&s;s. The timber is large and high, and in &s;uch variety, that almo&s;t all the different kinds grow|ing upon the Ohio and its branches (but with a greater proportion of black and white mulberry-trees) may be found here.&mdash;A &s;ilver mine has been di&s;covered about 28 miles above Ouiatanon, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> northern &s;ide of the Waba&s;h, and probably others may be found hereafter. The Waba&s;h abounds with &s;alt &s;prings, and any quantity of &s;alt may be made from them, in the manner now done at the Saline in the Illinois country:&mdash;the hills are reple|ni&s;hed with the be&s;t coal, and there is plenty of lime and free &s;tone, blue, yellow and white clay, for gla&s;s works and pottery. Two French &s;ettlements are e&s;tabli&s;hed on the Waba&s;h, called Po&s;t Vincient and Ouiatanon; the fir&s;t is 150 miles, and the other 262 miles from its mouth. The former is on the ea&s;tern &s;ide of the river, and con&s;i&s;ts of 60 &s;ettlers and their families. They rai&s;e Indian corn, wheat, and tobacco of an extraordinary good quality, &s;u|perior, it is &s;aid, to that produced in Virginia. They have a fine breed of hor&s;es (brought originally by the Indians from the Spani&s;h &s;ettlements on the we&s;tern &s;ide of the river Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi), and large &s;tocks of &s;wine and black cattle. The &s;ettlers deal with the natives for furs and deer &s;kins, to the amount of
<PB N="194" REF="028343_0226_0FD8AD6270A32818">
about 5000l. annually. Hemp of a good texture grows &s;pontaneou&s;ly in the low lands of the Waba&s;h, as do grapes in the greate&s;t abundance, having a black, thin &s;kin, and of which the inhabitants in the autumn make a &s;ufficient quantity (for their own con&s;umption) of well-ta&s;ted red-wine. Hops, large and good are found in many places, and the lands are particularly adapted to the culture of rice. All European fruits;&mdash;apples, peaches, pears, cherries, currants, goo&s;berries, melons, &amp;c. thrive well, both here and in the country bordering on the river Ohio.</P>
<P>"Ouiatanon is a &s;mall &s;tockaded fort on the we&s;t|ern &s;ide of the Waba&s;h, in which about a dozen fa|milies re&s;ide. The neighbouring Indians are the Kickapoos, Mu&s;quitons, Pyanki&s;haws, and a princi|pal part of the Ouiatanons. The whole of the&s;e tribes con&s;i&s;t, it is &s;uppo&s;ed, of about one thou&s;and war|riors. The fertility of &s;oil, and diver&s;ity of timber in this country, are the &s;ame as in the vicinity of Po&s;t Vincient. The annual amount of &s;kins and furs obtained at Ouiatanon is aboat 8000l. By the river Waba&s;h, the inhabitants of Detroit move to the &s;outhern parts of Ohio and the Illinois country. Their rout is by the Miami river to a carrying place, which, as before &s;tated, is nine miles to the Waba&s;h, when this river is rai&s;ed with fre&s;hes; but at other &s;ea&s;ons, the di&s;tance is from 18 to 30 miles, including the portage. The whole of the latter is through a level country. Carts are u&s;ually employed in tran&s;port|ing boats and merchandize from the Miami to the Waba&s;h river.</P>
<P>"The Shawanoe river empties it&s;elf on the ea&s;tern &s;ide of Ohio, about 95 miles &s;outhwardly of the Waba&s;h river.

<P>"The Cherokee river di&s;charges it&s;elf into the Ohio on the &s;ame &s;ide that the Shawanoe river does, that is, 13 miles below or &s;outherly of it, and 11 miles above, or northerly of the place where Fort-Ma&s;&s;ac formerly &s;tood, and 57 miles from the con|fluence of the Ohio with the river Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi. The Cherokee river has been navigated 900 miles from its mouth. At the di&s;tance of 220 miles from thence, it widens from 400 yards, (its general width) to be|tween two and three miles, and continues this breadth for near thirty miles farther. The whole of this di&s;|tance is called the Mu&s;cle Shoals. Here the chan|nel is ob&s;tructed with a number of i&s;lands, formed by trees and drifted wood, brought hither, at differ|ent &s;ea&s;ons of the year, in fre&s;hes and floods. In pa&s;&s;ing the&s;e i&s;lands, the middle of the wide&s;t inter|mediate water is to be navigated, as there it is deepe&s;t. From the mouth of the Cherokee river to Mu&s;cle Shoals the current is moderate, and both the high and low lands are rich, and abundantly covered with oaks, walnut, &s;ugar-trees, hickory, &amp;c. About 200 miles above the&s;e &s;hoals is, what is called, the Whirl, or Suck, occa&s;ioned, I imagine, by the high moun|tain, which there confines the river (&s;uppo&s;ed to be the Laurel mountain.) The Whirl, or Suck, con|tinues rapid for about three miles. Its width about fifty yards. A&s;cending the Cherokee river, and at about 100 miles from the Suck, and upon the &s;outh-ea&s;tern &s;ide of that river, is Highwa&s;ce river. Va&s;t tracts of level and rich land border on this river; but at a &s;mall di&s;tance from it, the country is much bro|ken, and &s;ome parts of it produce only pine trees. Forty miles higher up the Cherokee river, on the north-we&s;tern &s;ide, is Clin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he's river. It is 150 yards

wide, and about fifty miles up it &s;everal families are &s;ettled. From Clinche's to Tene&s;ee river is one hundred miles. It comes in on the ea&s;tern &s;ide, and is 250 yards wide. About ten miles up this ri|ver is a Cherokee town, called Chota, and further up this branch are &s;everal other Indian towns, po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed by Indians, called, the Overhill Cherokees. The navigation of this branch is much interrupted by rocks, as is al&s;o the river called French Broad, which comes into the Cherokee river fifty miles above the Tene&s;ee, and on the &s;ame &s;ide. One hun|dred and fifty miles above French Broad is Long-I&s;land, (three miles in length) and from thence to the &s;ource of the Cherokee river is &s;ixty miles, and the whole di&s;tance is &s;o rocky as to be &s;carcely navi|gable with a canoe.</P>
<P>"By the Cherokee river, the emigrants from the frontier counties of Virginia and North-Carolina, pa&s;s to the &s;ettlements in We&s;t-Florida, upon the river Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi. They embark at Long-I&s;land.</P>
<P>"I will now proceed to give a de&s;cription of that part called the Illinois country, lying between the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi we&s;terly, the Illinois river northerly, the Waba&s;h ea&s;terly, and the Ohio &s;outherly.</P>
<P>"The land at the confluence, or fork of the rivers Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi and Ohio, is above twenty feet higher than the common &s;urface of the&s;e rivers; yet &s;o con|&s;iderable are the &s;pring floods, that it is generally overflowed for about a week, as are the lands for &s;everal miles back in the country.&mdash;The &s;oil at the fork is compo&s;ed of mud, earth, and &s;and, accumu|lated from the Ohio and Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi rivers. It is ex|ceedingly fertile, and in its natural &s;tate yields hemp, pea-vines, gra&s;s, &amp;c. and a great variety of trees, and in particular the a&s;pen tree, of an unu&s;ual height and thickne&s;s.</P>
<P>"For 25 miles up the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi (from the Ohio) the country is rich, level, and well timbered; and

then &s;everal gentle ri&s;ing grounds appear, which gradually dimini&s;h at the di&s;tance of between four and five miles ea&s;tward from the river. From thence to the Ka&s;ka&s;kias river is 65 miles. The country is a mixture of hills and vallies; &s;ome of the former are rocky and &s;teep; but they, as well as the vallies, are &s;haded with fine oaks, hickory, walnut, a&s;h, and mulberry trees, &amp;c. Some of the high grounds af|ford mo&s;t plea&s;ant &s;ituations for &s;ettlements.

The&s;e are principally com|po&s;ed of lime and free-&s;tone, and from 100 to 130 feet high, divided in &s;everal places by deep cavities, through which many &s;mall rivulets pa&s;s before they fall into the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi. The &s;ides of the&s;e hills, fronting this river, are in many places perpendicu|lar, and appear like &s;olid pieces of &s;tone ma&s;onry, of various colours, figures, and &s;izes.</P>

<P>"The country, northward of this lake, is in many parts &s;welled with moderate hills, but no high moun|tains. The climate is temperate, and the air health|ful. The lands are well timbered (but not generally &s;o rich as tho&s;e upon the &s;outhern &s;ide of the lake), and for a con&s;iderable di&s;tance from it, and for &s;e|veral miles ea&s;tward of Cayahoga river, they appear quite level and extremely fertile; and except where exten&s;ive &s;avannahs, or natural meadows intervene, are covered with large oaks, walnut, a&s;h, hickory, mulberry, &s;a&s;&s;afras, &amp;c. &amp;c. and produce a great va|riety of &s;hrubs and medicinal roots.&mdash;Here al&s;o is great plenty of buffaloe, deer, turkies, partridges, &amp;c.</P>

&s;o that oppo&s;ite to the fort (which is 18 miles from Lake Erie) it does not exceed half a mile in width. From thence to Lake St. Clair it widens to more than a mile.

For eight miles below, and the &s;ame di&s;tance above Fort De|troit, on both &s;ides of the river, the country is divided into regular and well-cultivated plantations, and from the contiguity of the farmers' hou&s;es to each other, they appear as two long extended villages.

It is in general rapid, but particularly &s;o near its &s;ource: its channel, and al&s;o that of Lake St. Clair, are &s;ufficiently deep for &s;hipping of a very con&s;iderable burthen. This &s;trait has &s;everal mouths, and the lands lying between them are fine meadows. The country on both &s;ides of it, for 15 miles, has a very level appearance, but from thence to Lake Huron it is in many places broken, and covered with white pines, oaks, maple, birch, and beech."</P>

<HEAD>Thoughts on the Duration of the American Commonwealth.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is a greater probability that the duration of the American commonwealth will be longer than any empire that has hitherto exi&s;ted. For it is a truth, univer&s;ally admitted, that all the advantages which ever attended any of the monarchies in the old world, all center in the new, together with many others which they never enjoy. The four great empires, and the dominions of Charlemaign and the Turks, all ro&s;e by conque&s;ts&mdash;none by the arts of peace. On the contrary, the territory of the United States has been planted and reared by a union of liberty, good conduct, and all the comforts of dome&s;tic virtue.</P>
<P>All the greater monarchies were formed by the conque&s;t of kingdoms, different in arts, manners, language, temper, or religion, from the conquerors; &s;o that the union, though in &s;ome ca&s;es very &s;trong, was never the real and intimate connection of the &s;ame people; and this circum&s;tance principally acce|lerated their ruin, and was ab&s;olutely the cau&s;e of it in &s;ome. This will be very different in the Ameri|cans. They will, in their greate&s;t extent and popu|lation, be one and the &s;ame people&mdash;the &s;ame in lan|guage, religion, laws, manners, tempers and pur&s;uits; for the &s;mall variation in &s;ome di&s;tricts, owing to the &s;ettlement of Germans, is an exception &s;o very &s;light, that in a few ages it will be unknown.</P>
<P>The A&s;&s;yrian and Roman empires were of very &s;low growth, and therefore la&s;ted the longe&s;t; but &s;till their increa&s;e was by conque&s;t, and the union of di&s;|&s;onant parts. The Per&s;ian and Macedonian monar|chies were &s;oon founded and pre&s;ently overturned; the former not la&s;ting &s;o long as the A&s;&s;yrian, nor a &s;ixth of the duration of the Roman; and as to the Macedonian, it la&s;ted but &s;ix years. This advant<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ge

of a &s;low growth is &s;trong in favour of the Ameri|cans; the wonderful increa&s;e of their numbers is the natural effect of plenty of land, a good climate, and a mild and beneficent government, in which cor|ruption and tyranny are wholly unknown. Some centuries are already pa&s;t &s;ince their fir&s;t &s;ettlement, and many more will pa&s;s before their power appears in its full &s;plendour; but the quickne&s;s of a growth that is entirely natural will carry with it no marks of decay, being entirely different from monarchies found|ed by force of arms. The Roman empire peri&s;hed by the hands of northern barbarians, whom the ma&s;|ters of the world di&s;dained to conquer: it will not be &s;o with the Americans; they &s;pread gradually over the whole continent, in&s;omuch that two hundred years hence there probably will be nobody but them|&s;elves in the whole northern continent: from whence therefore &s;hould their Goths and Vandals come? Nor can they ever have any thing to fear from the &s;outh; fir&s;t, becau&s;e that country will never be populous, owing to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of mines: &s;econdly, there are &s;everal nations and languages planted and re|maining in it: thirdly, the mo&s;t con&s;iderable part of it lies in the torrid zone; a region that never yet &s;ent forth nations of conquerors.</P>
<P>In extent the habitable parts of North-America exceed that of any of the four empires, and con&s;e|quently can feed and maintain a people much more numerous than the A&s;&s;yrians or the Romans. The &s;ituation of the region is &s;o advantageous that it leaves nothing to be wi&s;hed for; it can have no neighbours from whom there is a po&s;&s;ibility of attack or mole&s;tation; it will po&s;&s;e&s;s all the &s;olid advantages of the Chine&s;e empire, without the fatal neighbour|hood of the Tartars.</P>
<P>It will have further the &s;ingular felicity of all the advantages of an i&s;land, that is, a freedom from the attacks of others, and too many difficulties, with
<PB N="208" REF="028343_0240_0FD8AD80A5B7FD98">
too great a di&s;tance, to engage in enterpri&s;es that heretofore proved the ruin of other monarchies.</P>
<P>The &s;oil, the climate, production, and face of the continent, are formed by nature for a great, indepen|dent, and permanent government: fill it with people who will of them&s;elves, of cour&s;e, po&s;&s;e&s;s all &s;orts of manufactures, and you will find it yielding every nece&s;&s;ary and convenience of life. Such a va&s;t tract of country, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing &s;uch &s;ingular advantages, be|coming inhabited by one people, &s;peaking the &s;ame language, profe&s;&s;ing the &s;ame religion, and having the &s;ame manners; attaining a population equal to that of the greate&s;t empire; &s;prung from an active and indu&s;trious nation, who have transfu&s;ed into them their own indu&s;try and &s;pirit, and &s;een them worthy of their original; inhabiting a &s;oil not dan|gerou&s;ly fertile, nor a clime generally conducive to effeminacy; accu&s;tomed to commerce: &s;uch a peo|ple mu&s;t found a commonwealth as indi&s;&s;oluble as humanity will allow. Suffice it for England, that &s;he will have been the origin of a commonwealth, greater and more durable than any former monarchy; that her language and her manners will flouri&s;h among a people who will one day become a &s;plendid &s;pec|tacle in the va&s;t eye of the univer&s;e. This flattering idea of immortality no other nation can hope to at|tain.</P>
<P>And here let me make an ob&s;ervation that &s;hould animate the authors in the Engli&s;h language with an ardour that cannot be infu&s;ed into tho&s;e of any other nation; it is the plea&s;ing idea of living among &s;o great a people, through almo&s;t a perpetuity of &s;ame, and under almo&s;t an impo&s;&s;ibility of becoming, like the Greek and Latin tongues, dead; known only by the learned.&mdash;Increa&s;ing time will bring increa&s;ing readers, until their names become repeated with plea&s;ure by above an hundred millions of people!</P>

<P>They do not di&s;courage our rice, pot and pearl a&s;h, &s;alted provi&s;ions, or whale oil: but the&s;e articles being in &s;mall demand at their markets, are carried thither but in a &s;mall degree. Their demand for rice, however, is increa&s;ing. Neither tobacco nor indigo are received there. Our commerce is per|mitted with their Canary I&s;lands, under the &s;ame conditions.</P>
<P>Them&s;elves and their colonies are the actual con|&s;umers of what they receive from us.</P>
<P>Our navigation is free with the kingdom of Spain; foreign goods being received there in our &s;hips, on the &s;ame conditions as if carried in their own, or in the ve&s;&s;els of the country of which &s;uch goods are the manufacture or produce.</P>
<P>Portugal receives favourably our grain and bread, &s;alted fi&s;h and other &s;alted provi&s;ions, wood, tar, pitch, and turpentine.</P>
<P>For flax-&s;eed, pot and pearl a&s;h, though not di&s;|couraged, there is little demand.</P>
<P>Our &s;hips pay 20 per cent. on being &s;old to their &s;ubjects, and are then free bottoms.</P>
<P>Foreign goods, (except tho&s;e of the Ea&s;t-Indies) are received on the &s;ame footing in our ve&s;&s;els as in their own, or any others; that is to &s;ay, on general duties of from twenty to twenty-eight per cent. and con&s;equently our navigation unob&s;tructed by them. Tobacco, rice, and meals, are prohibited.</P>
<P>Them&s;elves and their colonies con&s;ume what they receive from us.</P>
<P>The&s;e regulations extend to the Azores, Madeira, and the Cape de Verd I&s;lands, except that in the&s;e meals and rice are received freely.</P>

<P>A duty of five &s;ous the kental, or nearly four and a half cents, is paid on our tar, pitch, and tur|pentine. Our whale oil pays &s;ix livres the kental, and are the only foreign whale oils admitted. Our indigo pays five livres on the kental; their own, two and an half: but a difference of quality, &s;till more than a difference of duty, prevents its &s;eeking that market.</P>
<P>Salted beef is received freely for re-exportation, but if for home con&s;umption, it pays five livres the kental. Other &s;alted provi&s;ions pay that duty in all ca&s;es, and &s;alted fi&s;h is made lately to pay the prohi|bitory one of twenty livres in the kental.</P>
<P>Our &s;hips are free to carry thither all foreign goods which may be carried in their own or any other ve&s;&s;els, except tobaccoes not of our own growth; and they participate with their's the exclu&s;ive car|riage of our whale oils and tobaccoes.</P>
<P>During their former government, our tobacco was under a monopoly, but paid no duties; and our &s;hips were freely &s;old in their ports, and converted into national bottoms.

<P>Great-Britain receives our pot and pearl a&s;hes free, while tho&s;e of other nations pay a duty of two &s;hillings and three pence the kental.

&s;ome &s;mall duty from other countries. Our tar and pitch pay 11d. &s;terling the barrel; from other alien countries they pay about a penny and a third more.</P>
<P>Our tobacco, for their own con&s;umption, pays 1s. 3d. &s;terling the pound, cu&s;tom and exci&s;e, be|&s;ides heavy expences of collection. And rice, in the &s;ame ca&s;e, pays 7s. 4d. &s;terling the hundred weight; which rendering it too dear as an article of common food, it is con&s;equently u&s;ed in very &s;mall quantity.</P>
<P>Our &s;alted fi&s;h, and other &s;alted provi&s;ions, ex|cept bacon, are prohibited. Bacon and whale oil are under prohibitory duties; &s;o are our grains, meals, and bread, as to internal con&s;umption, unle&s;s in times of &s;uch &s;carcity as may rai&s;e the price of wheat to 50s. &s;terling the quarter, and other grains and meals in proportion.</P>
<P>Our &s;hips, though purcha&s;ed and navigated by their own &s;ubjects, are not permitted to be u&s;ed, even in their trade with us.</P>
<P>While the ve&s;&s;els of other nations are &s;ecured by &s;tanding laws, which cannot be altered but by the concurrent will of the three branches of the Briti&s;h legi&s;lature, in carrying thither any produce or ma|nufacture of the country to which they belong, which may be lawfully carried in any ve&s;&s;els, ours, with the &s;ame prohibition of what is foreign, are further prohibited by a &s;tanding law (12 Car. II.28. &sect; 3) from carrying thither all and any of our own dome&s;tic productions and manufactures. A &s;ub&s;e|quent act, indeed, authori&s;ed their executive to per|mit the carriage of our own productions in our own bottoms, at its &s;ole di&s;cretion; and the permi&s;&s;ion has been given from year to year by proclamation, but &s;ubject every moment to be withdrawn on that &s;ingle will, in which event our ve&s;&s;els having any thing on board, &s;tand interdicted from the entry of all Briti&s;h ports. The di&s;advantage of a tenure which may be &s;o &s;uddenly di&s;continued was e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">peri|enced
<PB N="214" REF="028343_0246_0FD8AD91EE37BDC8">
by our merchants on a late occa&s;ion, when an official notification that this law would be &s;trictly enforced, gave them ju&s;t apprehen&s;ions for the fate of their ve&s;&s;els and cargoes di&s;patched or di&s;tined to the ports of Great-Britain. The mini&s;ter of that court, indeed, frankly expre&s;&s;ed his per&s;onal con|viction that the words of the order went farther than was intended, and &s;o he afterwards officially inform|ed us; but the embarra&s;&s;ments of the moment were real and great, and the po&s;&s;ibility of their renewal lays our commerce to that country under the &s;ame &s;pecies of di&s;couragement as to other countries where it is regulated by a &s;ingle legi&s;lator; and the di&s;tinc|tion is too remarkable not to be noticed, that our navigation is excluded from the &s;ecurity of fixed laws, while that &s;ecurity is given to the navigation of others.</P>
<P>Our ve&s;&s;els pay their ports 1s. 9d. &s;terling per ton, light and trinity dues, more than is paid by Briti&s;h &s;hips, except in the port of London, where they pay the &s;ame as Briti&s;h.</P>
<P>The greater part of what they receive from us is re-exported to other countries, under the u&s;ele&s;s charges of an intermediate depo&s;it and double voy|age. From tables publi&s;hed in England, and com|po&s;ed, as is &s;aid, from the books of their cu&s;tom-hou&s;es, it appears that of the indigo imported there in the years 1773&mdash;4&mdash;5, one third was re-exported; and from a document of authority, we learn that of the rice and tobacco imported there before the war, four-fifths were re-exported. We are a&s;&s;ured, in|deed, that the quantities &s;ent thither for re-exporta|tion &s;ince the war, are con&s;iderably dimini&s;hed, yet le&s;s &s;o than rea&s;on and national intere&s;t would dic|tate. The whole of our grain is re-exported when wheat is below 50s. the quarter, and other grains in proportion.</P>

<P>All other of our productions are received on va|ried duties, which may be reckoned on a medium at about three per cent.</P>
<P>They con&s;ume but a &s;mall proportion of what they receive; the re&s;idue is partly forwarded for con|&s;umption in the inland parts of Europe, and partly re-&s;hipped to other maritime countries. On the latter proportion they intercept between us and the con&s;umer &s;o much of the value as is ab&s;orbed by the charges attending an intermediate depo&s;it.</P>
<P>Foreign goods, except &s;ome Ea&s;t-India articles, are received in ve&s;&s;els of any nation.</P>
<P>Our &s;hips may be &s;old and naturalized there with exceptions of one or two privileges, which &s;ome|what le&s;&s;en their value.</P>
<P>Denmark lays con&s;iderable duties on our tobacco and rice carried in their own ve&s;&s;els, and half as much more if carried in ours; but the exact amount of the&s;e duties is not perfectly known here. They lay &s;uch as amount to prohibitions on our indigo and corn.</P>
<P>Sweden receives favourably our grains and meals, &s;alted provi&s;ions, indigo, and whale oil.</P>

Being thus rendered too dear as an article of common food, little of it is con&s;umed with them. They con&s;ume more of our tobaccoes, which they take circuitou&s;ly through Great-Britain, levying heavy duties on them al&s;o; their duties of entry, town duties, and exci&s;e, being 4 dols. 34 cents. the hundred weight, if carried in their own ve&s;&s;els, and of 40 per cent. on that addi|tional, if carried in our own or any other ve&s;&s;els.</P>
<P>They prohibit altogether our bread, fi&s;h, pot and

pearl a&s;hes, flax-&s;eed, tar, pitch and turpentine, wood (except oak timber and ma&s;ts), and all foreign manufactures.</P>

<P>Spain and Portugal refu&s;e to tho&s;e parts of Ame|rica which they govern, all direct intercour&s;e with any people but them&s;elves. The commodities in mutual demand between them and their neighbours mu&s;t be carried to be exchanged in &s;ome port of the dominant country, and the tran&s;portation between that and the &s;ubject &s;tate mu&s;t be in a dome&s;tic bottom.</P>
<P>France, by a &s;tanding law, permits her We&s;t-India po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions to receive directly our vegetables, live provi&s;ions, hor&s;es, wood, tar, pitch and turpen|tine, rice and maize, and prohibits our other bread &s;tuff; but a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of this prohibition having been left to the colonial legi&s;latures in times of &s;car|city, it was formerly &s;u&s;pended occa&s;ionally, but latterly without interruption.</P>
<P>Our fre&s;h and &s;alted provi&s;ions (except pork) are received in their i&s;lands under a duty of three colonial livres the kental, and our ve&s;&s;els are as free as their own to carry our commodities thither, and to bring away rum and mola&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>Great-Britain admits in her i&s;lands our vegetables, live provi&s;ions, hor&s;es, wood, tar, pitch and turpen|tine, rice and bread &s;tuff, by a proclamation of her executive, limited always to the term of a year. She prohibits our &s;alted provi&s;ions: &s;he does not permit our ve&s;&s;els to carry thither our own produce. Her ve&s;&s;els alone may take it from us, and bring in exchange, rum, mola&s;&s;es, &s;ugar, coffee&punc; cocoa nuts, ginger, and pimento. There are, indeed, &s;ome freedoms in the i&s;land of Dominica, but under &s;uch

circum&s;tances as to be little u&s;ed by us. In the Briti&s;h continental colonies, and in Newfoundland, all our productions are prohibited, and our ve&s;&s;els forbidden to enter their ports; their governors how|ever, in times of di&s;tre&s;s, have power to permit a temporary importation of certain articles in their own bottoms, but not in ours.</P>
<P>Our citizens cannot re&s;ide as merchants or factors within any of the Briti&s;h plantations, this being ex|pre&s;sly prohibited by the &s;ame &s;tatute of 12 Car. II. C. 18. commonly called the Navigation Act.</P>
<P>In the Dani&s;h American po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, a duty of five per cent. is levied on our corn, corn-meal, rice, tobacco, wood, &s;alted fi&s;h, indigo, hor&s;es, mules, and live &s;tock; and of ten per cent. on our flour, &s;alted pork and beef, tar, pitch, and turpentine.</P>
<P>In the American i&s;lands of the United Nether|lands and Sweden, our ve&s;&s;els and produce are re|ceived, &s;ubject to duties, not &s;o heavy as to have been complained of; but they are heavier in the Dutch po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions on the continent.</P>

<P>Such being the re&s;trictions on the commerce and navigation of the United States, the que&s;tion is, in what way they may be&s;t be removed, modified, or counteracted?</P>
<P>As to the commerce, two methods occur. 1. By friendly arrangements with the &s;everal nations with whom the&s;e re&s;trictions exi&s;t: or, 2d. By the &s;epa|rate act of our own legi&s;latures for countervailing their effects.</P>
<P>There can be no doubt, but that of the&s;e two, friendly arrangement is the mo&s;t eligible. In&s;tead of embarra&s;&s;ing commerce under piles of regulating laws, duties, and prohibitions, could it be relieved from all its &s;hackles in all parts of the world&mdash;could every country be employed in producing that which nature has be&s;t fitted it to produce, and each be free to exchange with others mutual &s;urplu&s;&s;es for mutual wants, the greate&s;t ma&s;s po&s;&s;ible would then be pro|duced of tho&s;e things which contribute to human life and human happine&s;s&punc; the numbers of mankind would be increa&s;ed, and their condition bettered.</P>
<P><PB N="219" REF="028343_0251_0FD8ADA0E0876480">Would even a &s;ingle nation begin with the United States this &s;y&s;tem of free commerce, it would be advi&s;able to begin it with that nation; &s;ince it is by one only that it can be extended to all. Where the circum&s;tances of either party render it expedient to levy a revenue, by way of impo&s;t, on commerce, its freedom might be modified, in that particular, by mutual and equivalent mea&s;ures, pre&s;erving it entire in all others.</P>
<P>Some nations, not yet ripe for free commerce, in all its extent, might &s;till be willing to mollify its re|&s;trictions and regulations for us in proportion to the advantages which an intercour&s;e with us might offer. Particularly they may concur with us in re|ciprocating the duties to be levied on each &s;ide, or in compen&s;ating any exce&s;s of duty, by equivalent advantages of another nature. Our commerce is certainly of a character to entitle it to favour in mo&s;t countries. The commodities we offer are either nece&s;&s;aries of life, or materials for manufacture, or convenient &s;ubjects of revenue; and we take in ex|change, either manufactures, when they have re|ceived the la&s;t fini&s;h of art and indu&s;try, or m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">re luxuries. Such cu&s;tomers may rea&s;onably expect welcome, and friendly treatment at every market; cu&s;tomers too, who&s;e demands, increa&s;ing with their wealth and population, mu&s;t very &s;hortly give full employment to the whole indu&s;try of any nation whatever, in any line of &s;upply they may get into the habit of calling for from it.</P>
<P>But &s;hould any nation, contrary to our wi&s;hes, &s;uppo&s;e it may better find its advantages by continu|ing its &s;y&s;tem of prohibitions, duties, and regula|tions, it behoves us to protect our citizens, their commerce, and navigation, by counter-prohibitions, duties, and regulations al&s;o. Free commerce and navigation are not to be given in exchange for re|&s;trictions and vexations; nor are they likely to pro|duce a relaxation of them.</P>
<P><PB N="220" REF="028343_0252_0FD8ADA260E72FF0">Our navigation involves &s;till higher con&s;idera|tions. As a branch of indu&s;try, it is valuable; but as a re&s;ource, e&s;&s;ential.</P>
<P>Its value, as a branch of indu&s;try, is enhanced by the dependence of &s;o many other branches on it. In times of general peace it multiplies competitors for employment in tran&s;portation, and &s;o keeps that at its proper level; and in times of war, that is to &s;ay, when tho&s;e nations who may be our principal car|riers, &s;hall be at war with each other, if we have not within our&s;elves the means of tran&s;portation, our produce mu&s;t be exported in belligerent ve&s;&s;els at the increa&s;ed expence of warfreight and in&s;urance, and the articles which will not bear that, mu&s;t peri&s;h on our hands.</P>
<P>But it is a re&s;ource for defence that our navigation will admit neither neglect nor forbearance. The po&s;ition and circum&s;tances of the United States leave them nothing to fear on their land-board, and nothing to de&s;ire beyond their pre&s;ent rights. But on their &s;ea-board, they are open to injury, and they have there, too, a commerce which mu&s;t be protected. This can only be done by po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing a re&s;pectable body of citizen-&s;eamen, and of arti&s;ts and e&s;tabli&s;h|ments in readine&s;s for &s;hip-building.</P>
<P>Were the ocean, which is the common property of all, open to the indu&s;try of all, &s;o that every per|&s;on and ve&s;&s;el &s;hould be free to take employment wherever it could be found, the United States would certainly not &s;et the example of appropriating to them&s;elves, exclu&s;ively, any portion of the common &s;tock of occupation. They would rely on the en|terpri&s;e and activity of their citizens for a due parti|cipation of the benefits of the &s;eafaring bu&s;ine&s;s, and for keeping the marine cla&s;s of citizens equal to their object. But if particular nations gra&s;p at undue &s;hares&punc; and more e&s;pecially if they &s;eize on the means of the United States to convert them into aliment for their own &s;trength&punc; and wit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">draw them entirely from

the &s;upport of tho&s;e to whom they belong, defen&s;ive and protecting mea&s;ures become nece&s;&s;ary on the part of the nation who&s;e marine re&s;ources are thus invaded, or it will be di&s;armed of its defence; its productions will lie at the mercy of the nation which has po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed it&s;elf exclu&s;ively of the means of carrying them, and its politics may be influenced by tho&s;e who command its commerce. The carri|age of our own commodities, if once e&s;tabli&s;hed in another channel, cannot be re&s;umed in the moment we may de&s;ire. If we lo&s;e the &s;eamen and arti&s;ts whom it now occupies, we lo&s;e the pre&s;ent means of marine defence, and time will be requi&s;ite to rai&s;e up others, when di&s;grace or lo&s;&s;es &s;hall bring home to our feelings the error of having abandoned them. The materials for maintaining our due &s;hare of na|vigation are ours in abundance; and as to the mode of u&s;ing them, we have only to adopt the principles of tho&s;e who thus put us on the defen&s;ive, or others equivalent and better fitted to our circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>The following principles being founded in reci|procity, appear perfectly ju&s;t, and to offer no cau&s;e of complaint to any nation.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. Where a nation impo&s;es high duties on our productions, or prohibits them altogether, it may be proper for us to do the &s;ame by theirs, fir&s;t burthen|ing or excluding tho&s;e productions which they bring here in competition with our own of the &s;ame kind; &s;electing next &s;uch manufactures as we take from them in greate&s;t quantity, and which at the &s;ame time we could the &s;oone&s;t furni&s;h to our&s;elves, or obtain from other countries; impo&s;ing on them du|ties lighter at fir&s;t, but heavier and heavier afterwards, as other channels of &s;upply open. Such duties hav|ing the effect of indirect encouragement to dome&s;tic manufactures of the &s;ame kind, may induce the manufacturer to come him&s;elf into tho&s;e &s;tates; where cheaper &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, equal laws, and a ve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> of his wares, free of duty, may in&s;ure him the
<PB N="222" REF="028343_0254_0FD8ADA7C51C5980">
highe&s;t profits from his &s;kill and indu&s;try. And here it would be in the power of the &s;tate govern|ments to co-operate e&s;&s;entially, by opening the re|&s;ources of encouragement which are under their controul, extending them liberally to arti&s;ts in tho&s;e particular branches of manufacture, for which their &s;oil, climate, population, and other circum&s;tances have matured them, and fo&s;tering the precious efforts and progre&s;s of hou&s;ehold manufacture, by &s;ome pa|tronage &s;uited to the nature of its objects, guided by the local informations they po&s;&s;e&s;s, and guarded again&s;t abu&s;e by their pre&s;ence and attentions. The oppre&s;&s;ions on our agriculture in foreign ports would thus be made the occa&s;ion of relieving it from a dependence on the councils and conduct of others, and of promoting arts, manufactures, and popula|tion, at home.</P>
<P N="2">2d. Where a nation refu&s;es permi&s;&s;ion to our merchants and factors to re&s;ide within certain parts of their dominions, we may, if it &s;hould be thought expedient, refu&s;e re&s;idence to theirs in any and every part of ours, or modify their tran&s;actions.</P>
<P N="3">3. Where a nation refu&s;es to receive in our ve&s;&s;els any productions but our own, we may refu&s;e to re|ceive, in theirs, any but their own productions. The fir&s;t and &s;econd clau&s;es of the bill reported by the committee are well formed to effect this object.</P>
<P N="4">4th. Where a nation refu&s;es to con&s;ider any ve&s;&s;el as ours which has not been built within our territo|ries, we &s;hould refu&s;e to con&s;ider as theirs any ve&s;|&s;el not built within their territories.</P>
<P N="5">5th. Where a nation refu&s;es to our ve&s;&s;els the carriage even of our own productions to certain countries under their domination, we might refu&s;e to theirs, of every de&s;cription, the carriage of the &s;ame productions to the &s;ame countries. But as ju&s;tice and good neighbourhood would dictate, that tho&s;e who have no part in impo&s;ing the re&s;triction on us, &s;hould not be the victims of mea&s;ures adopted to de|feat
<PB N="223" REF="028343_0255_0FD8ADA91F445D30">
its effect, it may be proper to confine the re|&s;triction of ve&s;&s;els owned or navigated by any &s;ub|jects of the &s;ame dominant power, other than the in|habitants of the country to which the &s;aid produc|tions are to be carried.&mdash;And to prevent all incon|venience to the &s;aid inhabitants, and to our own, by too &s;udden a check on the means of tran&s;porta|tion, we may continue to admit the ve&s;&s;els marked for future exclu&s;ion, on an advanced tonnage, and for &s;uch length of time only, as may be &s;uppo&s;ed ne|ce&s;&s;ary to provide again&s;t that inconvenience.</P>
<P>The e&s;tabli&s;hment of &s;ome of the&s;e principles by Great-Britain alone has already lo&s;t us, in our com|merce with that country and its po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, between eight and nine hundred ve&s;&s;els of near 40,000 tons burthen, according to &s;tatements from official mate|rials, in which they have confidence. This involves a proportional lo&s;s of &s;eamen, &s;hipwrights, and &s;hip-building, and is too &s;erious a lo&s;s to admit forbear|ance of &s;ome effectual remedy.</P>
<P>It is true we mu&s;t expect &s;ome inconvenience in practice, from the e&s;tabli&s;hment of di&s;criminating duties. But in this, as in &s;o many other ca&s;es, we are left to choo&s;e between two evils. The&s;e incon|veniences are nothing when weighed again&s;t the lo&s;s of wealth and lo&s;s of force, which will follow our per&s;everance in the plan of indi&s;crimination.&mdash; When once it &s;hall be perceived that we are either in the &s;y&s;tem or the habit of giving equal advantages to tho&s;e who extingui&s;h our commerce and naviga|tion, by duties and prohibitions, as to tho&s;e who treat both with liberality and ju&s;tice, liberality and ju&s;tice will be converted by all into duties and pro|hibitions. It is not to the moderation and ju&s;tice of others we are to tru&s;t for fair and equal acce&s;s to market with our productions, or for our due &s;hare in the tran&s;portation of them; but to our means of independence, and the firm will to u&s;e them. Nor do the inconveniencies of di&s;crimination merit con|&s;ideration.
<PB N="224" REF="028343_0256_0FD8ADAD386754C0">
Not one of the nations before mention|ed, perhaps not a commercial nation on earth, is without them. In our ca&s;e one di&s;tinction alone will &s;uffice, that is to &s;ay, between nations who fa|vour our productions and navigation, and tho&s;e who do not favour them. One &s;et of moderate du|ties, &s;ay the pre&s;ent duties, for the fir&s;t, and a fixed advance on the&s;e as to &s;ome articles, and prohibitions as to others, for the la&s;t.</P>
<P>Still it mu&s;t be repeated, that friendly arrange|ments are preferable with all who will come into them; and that we &s;hould carry into &s;uch arrange|ments all the liberality and &s;pirit of accommodation, which the nature of the ca&s;e will admit.</P>
<P>France has, of her own accord, propo&s;ed nego|ciations for improving, by a new treaty, on fair and equal principles, the commercial relations of the two countries. But her internal di&s;turbances have hi|therto prevented the pro&s;ecution of them to effect, though we have had repeated a&s;&s;urances of a conti|nuance of the di&s;po&s;ition.</P>
<P>Propo&s;als of friendly arrangement have been made on our part by the pre&s;ent government to that of Great-Britain, as the me&s;&s;age &s;tates; but, being already on as good a footing in law, and a better in fact, than the mo&s;t favoured nation, they have not as yet di&s;|covered any di&s;po&s;ition to have it meddled with.</P>
<P>We have no rea&s;on to conclude that friendly ar|rangements would be declined by the other nations with whom we have &s;uch commercial intercour&s;e as may render them important. In the mean while, it would re&s;t with the wi&s;dom of Congre&s;s to determine whether, as to tho&s;e, nations, they will not &s;urcea&s;e exparte regulations, on the rea&s;onable pre&s;umption that they will concur in doing whatever ju&s;tice and moderation dictate &s;hould be done.</P>
