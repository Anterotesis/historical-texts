<HEAD>AN ELECTION SERMON.</HEAD>
<P>_IN obedience to the appointment of the late honorable General Court, I appear in the de&s;k on this occa&s;ion. It becomes not me to cen&s;ure their conduct, in overlooking my worthy fathers and elder brethren, whom propriety would have pla|ced before me in &s;uch a &s;ervice. This as well as other rea&s;ons might have legitimated my declin|ing to accept the honor; but &s;uch a &s;tep might have been mi&s;con&s;trued, as if it had proceeded from a di&s;approbation of a practice worthily be|gun, and which &s;ome of the be&s;t characters among us wi&s;h may be continued, namely, the entering on the yearly bu&s;ine&s;s of legi&s;lation, by a religious &s;olemnity.</P>
<P>It &s;hall now be my endeavor, with the freedom of an American, to offer &s;ome thoughts on what I conceive to be the true intere&s;t, and the be&s;t means of the pro&s;perity of this State, and that

<P>"Rid me and deliver me from the hand of &s;trange children; who&s;e mouth &s;peaketh vanity, and their right hand is a right hand of fal&s;hood.</P>

<P>DAVID was a wi&s;e and faithful prince, ever attentive to the true intere&s;t of the people whom he governed. It was no di&s;advantage to him that he was rai&s;ed from the humble employ|ment of a &s;hepherd, to be a &s;upreme ruler; for having pa&s;&s;ed through the lower &s;tations of life, and been conver&s;ant with men of every order and degree, he well knew what duty every man could do; what burdens they could bear; how they thought; what they &s;aid; how they were to be
<PB N="5" REF="018927_0005_0FA90A5E83C40128" MS="y">
plea&s;ed, or offended; and in what manner their different capacities and genui&s;es might be employ|ed for the general &s;ervice of the kingdom. Ha|ving been intimately acquainted with per&s;ons di&s;|affected to the government of his predece&s;&s;or, he under&s;tood the &s;ecret workings of jealou&s;y, envy, and ambition, and how to counterwork their baneful influence. Having been obliged to take refuge from the per&s;ecuting fury of Saul, among the open and profe&s;&s;ed enemies of his country, into who&s;e confidence he had the addre&s;s to in&s;i|nuate him&s;elf &s;o far as to be entru&s;ted with a command, he acquired a knowledge of their &s;ecret coun&s;els, their views, their arts, and methods of war. In &s;uch ways was this truly great man trained up, till he had acquired tho&s;e accompli&s;h|ments which fitted him to be ruler over I&s;rael, who&s;e true intere&s;t &s;eems to have lain near his heart, to have employed his &s;ecret thoughts, to have been the &s;ubject of his devotions, and in many of his poetical compo&s;itions.</P>
<P>AT what time, or on what particular occa&s;ion, this P&s;alm was written, we have no other infor|mation than what may be gained from its inter|nal characters. It &s;eems from thence to have been written, when David apprehended the king|dom
<PB N="6" REF="018927_0006_0FA90A5F40FDCCA8">
was in danger, from enemies, either foreign or dome&s;tic. They are called "<HI>&s;trange children</HI>" and their character is that "<HI>their mouth &s;peaketh va|nity, and their right hand is a right hand of fal&s;hood</HI>;" from them David prays GOD to deliver him, and takes encouragement from his pa&s;t experience of the divine goodne&s;s, from the vanity of human power, and from the &s;uperior avenging arm of heaven, to hope that he &s;hould be delivered.</P>
<P>WHO the&s;e &s;trange children were, we can but conjecture. They might be the tribes of roving Arabs, who were often &s;eeking opportunities to commit depredations on the peaceful inhabitants, robbing them of their &s;eed-corn, laying wa&s;te their fields, driving away their cattle and &s;heep, or car|rying their children into captivity. Or they might be the formidable Phili&s;tines, who made war in a more regular manner, and had a mo&s;t inveterate hatred to the nation of I&s;rael: Or they might be dome&s;tic enemies; either the remnant of the old Canaanites, who were incorporated with I&s;rael, and often proved a &s;courge to them; or &s;ome of the I&s;raelites them&s;elves &s;educed and de|generated &s;o far as to take part with them again&s;t their brethren. But, be their per&s;ons who they will, their characters are fairly drawn, they were
<PB N="7" REF="018927_0007_0FA90A600FCBD6A8">
"<HI>&s;trange children,</HI>" alienated from, and oppo&s;ed to the intere&s;t of the nation; their views were ini|mical, and they fought to hinder tho&s;e things which David regarded as the be&s;t means of the pro&s;perity of his people. <HI>"Who&s;e mouth &s;peaketh va|nity."</HI> Vanity is a general name for wickedne&s;s, and it may here be under&s;tood as &s;omething &s;poken again&s;t the things which David de&s;ired. They were per&s;ons who&s;e aims and de&s;igns were un|friendly to the public intere&s;t, and who&s;e tongues were employed in propagating bad principles, and prejudicing the minds of the people again&s;t the means of improvement.</P>
<P><HI>"<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">ight hand is a right hand of fal&s;hood."</HI> The right hand among the ancients was an em|blem of power. The&s;e then were per&s;ons who had power to do mi&s;chief. If they were dome&s;tic enemies, they were per&s;ons in office, or who had influence over the people to mi&s;lead them, by fal&s;e rea&s;onings, and work on their pa&s;&s;ions or pre|judices; if they were bad neighbours, they had &s;trength enough to make inroads and commit violence, to break up &s;ettlements, to lay wa&s;te fields and di&s;per&s;e families.</P>
<P>THESE are &s;ome of their characters. But we may learn &s;omething more of them, if we con&s;ider what
<PB N="8" REF="018927_0008_0FA90A60E4D79848">
advantages David expected from the deliverance which he prays for. <HI>"That our &s;ons may be as plants grown up in their youth."</HI> He was a friend to educa|tion, and wi&s;hed that all ob&s;tacles to this good work might be taken away. Plants which grow up when they are young, that is, which attain their form and &s;ize while the growing &s;ea&s;on con|tinues, are more u&s;eful as well as plea&s;ant than tho&s;e which are neglected or &s;tinted in their growth. So children, who have the proper means of education during the &s;ea&s;on of improvement, are in general better fitted for u&s;efulne&s;s than tho&s;e who are neglected.</P>
<P><HI>"That our daughters may be as corner &s;tones pol|i&s;hed after the &s;imilitude of a palace."</HI> We in this country know &s;o little of palaces, that we may not be able to comprehend the full force of this allu|&s;ion; but we may depend upon it, that it means &s;omething extremely elegant and beautiful; tho&s;e beauties, tho&s;e virtues, tho&s;e graces in which the &s;ofter &s;ex are de&s;tined by nature to &s;hine, &s;et off to the be&s;t advantage by due cultivation and im|provement. The fine&s;t marble is capable of the highe&s;t poli&s;h, and it is an injury to it if we let it go without the fini&s;hing hand of the mo&s;t delicate artificer.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="018927_0009_0FA90A62E6541688">HENCE we may conclude that the&s;e "<HI>&s;trange children</HI>" were per&s;ons who&s;e views were unfriend|ly to family order, and the education of youth, and as the&s;e were ble&s;&s;ings of which David fully knew the value, it was natural for him to pray for deliverance from &s;uch enemies. But ano|ther happy con&s;equence which he expected to re&s;ult from their removal, was the increa&s;e of the fruits of the earth, and of tho&s;e bea&s;ts which were u&s;eful for burden and for food. <HI>"That our gar|ners may be full, affording all manner of &s;tore; that our &s;heep may bring forth thou&s;ands, and ten thou&s;ands in our &s;treets; that our oxen may be &s;trong to labor."</HI> In &s;uch a country as David's, "<HI>a land of hills and vallies, and that drinketh water of the rain of hea|ven,</HI>" the&s;e were the mo&s;t natural and profitable productions, the true &s;ources of wealth and inde|pendence. He was fully &s;en&s;ible from his own experience, and his acquaintance with mankind, that a country able to &s;ub&s;i&s;t by its own native produce, and a race of &s;ubjects inured to field-la|bour, and attached to the &s;oil by the right of in|heritance, afforded the be&s;t &s;upport to his throne, and the &s;ure&s;t means of defence: That his coun|try might be thus ble&s;&s;ed, he prayed to be deliv|ered from tho&s;e per&s;ons who had power to pre|vent the increa&s;e of the&s;e natural ble&s;&s;ings.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="018927_0010_0FA90A6314AD4620">THE la&s;t line of their character is pointed out in that additional ble&s;&s;ing, which he fore&s;ees will be the re&s;ult of their removal; "<HI>that there be no breaking in nor going out, that there be no complain|ing in our &s;treets.</HI>" The&s;e words &s;eem to de&s;cribe a &s;tate of predatory war, &s;uch as is u&s;ually made by &s;avage nations, who attack by &s;urpri&s;e and car|ry away pri&s;oners and plunder in a &s;udden, vio|lent and irre&s;i&s;table manner, leaving the remaining inhabitants &s;ufficient cau&s;e of complaint, but no means of redre&s;s. Such enemies have been known in this country, as well as David's, and we have rea&s;on to regard a deliverance from them as one of the greate&s;t mercies.</P>
<P>HAVING mentioned the&s;e as the particular ble&s;&s;|ings which he wi&s;hed might be the portion of the people whom he governed, and which he expected would follow the removal of the enemies they were then troubled with, he reviews the &s;ubject in devout admiration, and exclaims "<HI>happy is the peo|ple that is in &s;uch a ca&s;e.</HI>" The&s;e were the mo&s;t valuable of all national temporal ble&s;&s;ings, and &s;uch a people were, as far as the&s;e could make them, happy; but as this could not be the ca&s;e of a people without the peculiar providence of the &s;upreme being, he adds, "<HI>yea happy is that people
<PB N="11" REF="018927_0011_0FA90A63BB2BF6E8">
who&s;e</HI> GOD <HI>is the</HI> LORD;" implying, that a people thus highly favoured with the be&s;t means of na|tional pro&s;perity were a people under the paren|tal care of the be&s;t of beings, who was their guar|dian and deliverer. But there is a farther idea comprized in the &s;entence, for a people who have &s;uch a GOD as this, and are not &s;en&s;ible of their obligations to him, nor di&s;po&s;ed to make grateful and devout returns to him, cannot be called hap|py. Happine&s;s con&s;i&s;ts not barely in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the means of enjoyment, but in having a &s;en&s;e of the &s;ource from whence they flow, and in be|ing di&s;po&s;ed to make a proper u&s;e of them. There|fore, if a people who are in &s;uch a ca&s;e are happy, if they are happy in having the LORD for their GOD, it mu&s;t be under&s;tood that they have a know|ledge of this GOD, a &s;en&s;e of their obligations to him, and a dipo&s;ition to do his will as it is made known to them. The nation of I&s;rael had &s;uffi|cient means of knowing, wor&s;hipping and &s;erving this GOD, &s;o have we; and when we are &s;en&s;ible of our obligations to him, and di&s;po&s;ed to fulfil them, we &s;hall be a truly happy people.</P>
<P>FROM the text thus de&s;canted on, we may ga|ther what were in David's view, the proper ob|jects of a ruler's attention, and the &s;ure means of national pro&s;perity, viz.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="018927_0012_0FA90A661D064858">THE education of youth.&mdash;The improvement of the country.&mdash;Peace, and religion.</P>
<P>SHALL I now endeavor to excite the attention of this a&s;&s;embly, and particularly of the public Repre&s;entative Fathers of this people, to the&s;e no|ble objects, thus pointed out to our view by one of the greate&s;t Princes and wi&s;e&s;t State&s;men that ever lived.</P>
<P>THE <HI>education of youth</HI> is the mo&s;t capital and important con&s;ideration; the wi&s;e&s;t legi&s;lators in the world have attended to it as e&s;&s;ential to the pro&s;perity of a people, and the be&s;t writers on government have recommended it in the &s;ame view.
<Q>The duty of rulers (&s;ays one <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">BURLAMAGUI'S political Law, vol. 2, p. 144.161.</NOTE> of them) is not only to pre&s;cribe good laws, by which every one may know how to behave; but to e&s;tabli&s;h the mo&s;t perfect manner of public in|&s;titution and education of youth. This is the only way of making &s;ubjects conform to the laws by rea&s;on and cu&s;tom, rather than fear of pun|i&s;hment. Children are the hope and &s;trength of a nation, and it is too late to correct them when they are &s;poiled; it is infinitely better to prevent the evil than to puni&s;h it. It is not laws and ordinances, but good morals that re|gulate the State. Tho&s;e who have had a bad
<PB N="13" REF="018927_0013_0FA90A66C02913A0">
education make no &s;cruple to violate the be&s;t con&s;titutions in the world, whereas they who have been properly trained up, cheerfully con|form to all good in&s;titutions. The mo&s;t effec|tual means therefore, which a Sovereign can employ to promote the public happine&s;s, is to work on the mind by di&s;po&s;ing the hearts of his &s;ubjects to wi&s;dom and virtue, and to make them early acquainted with the rules of an happy and virtuous life. By means of public in&s;truction, he has an effectual method of in&s;tilling ju&s;t ideas into the minds of his &s;ubjects, and his authority has a very great influence on the internal actions, the thoughts and inclinations of tho&s;e who are &s;ubject to his laws, &s;o far at lea&s;t as the nature of the thing will permit.</Q></P>
<P>AS an exemplification of the&s;e remarks, permit me to recite a pa&s;&s;age from another author <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">ROLLIN'S ancient Hi&s;tory vol. 2, p. 292.</NOTE> who thus celebrates the conduct of the great <HI>Lycurgus.</HI>
<Q>He looked upon the education of youth as the mo&s;t im|portant object of a legi&s;lators care. His grand prin|ciple was that children belong to the State more than to their parents, and therefore he would have the State entru&s;ted with the general care of their
<PB N="14" REF="018927_0014_0FA90A6835E43420">
education, in order to have them formed on uni|form con&s;tant principles, which might in&s;pire them betimes with the love of their country and of virtue. The long duration of the laws of <HI>Lycurgus</HI> is very wonderful; but the means he u&s;ed to &s;ucceed, are no le&s;s worthy of admi|ration; the principal of the&s;e was the excellent edu|cation of youth. The religious obligation of an oath which he exacted from the citizens, would have been but a feeble tie, had he not by education infu&s;ed his laws as it were into the minds and manners of the children. This was the rea&s;on that his principal ordinances &s;ub&s;i&s;ted above five hundred years.</Q></P>
<P>THAT &s;entiment of <HI>Lycurgus,</HI> that "children belong to the State more than to their parents" ought to be deeply engraved on the heart of every per&s;on who is concerned in making or executing laws, e&s;pecially tho&s;e which relate to the morals of the people. Nature hath diffu&s;ed her gifts with an impartial as well as a liberal hand; &s;he gives geni|us to tho&s;e who have not, as well as to tho&s;e who have the means within their power to cultivate and im|prove it. There are as many good capacities among the children of the poor, who are not able to give them a good education, as of the rich who are;
<PB N="15" REF="018927_0015_0FA90A68497E0DC0">
and if it is the duty and intere&s;t of the State to avail it&s;elf of the capacities of all its citizens, it is then their duty and intere&s;t to cultivate tho&s;e ca|pacities. Children indeed depend in a great mea|&s;ure on their parents, and are by nature &s;ubject to family government; but the public ought in ju&s;tice to it&s;elf to provide the means of in&s;truction for all; then, if parents will not &s;uffer their chil|dren to u&s;e tho&s;e means of in&s;truction, the fault will be theirs. But this is very &s;eldom the ca&s;e; mo&s;t parents are fond of putting their children under public in&s;truction, if it can be had, and many are daily complaining for the want of it.</P>
<P>IT is rare to find a genius &s;trong enough to &s;truggle with the di&s;advantages ari&s;ing from the want of early education, and by its own native force and per&s;everance make its way into public life, and attain its proper rank in &s;ociety; yet &s;uch in&s;tances there are, and &s;ome principal cha|racters in this State, both dead and living may be reckoned of the number: but how many more have there been, with a genius not inferior, who for want of that cultivation which in other places is thrown away on blockheads, have langui&s;hed in ob&s;curity, or turned their attention to inferior objects, or perverted their faculties to ignoble pur|&s;uits
<PB N="16" REF="018927_0016_0FA90A6907625D98">
and fallen among the &s;plendid ruins of hu|man nature! The lo&s;s which this State &s;uffers by the want of proper methods of education, is in|conceivable: Genius of every kind is not &s;carcer here than in any other parts of the continent, or the world; but if a country &s;tored with diamonds lying in their native cru&s;t, may be denominated poor, becau&s;e it is neglected&punc; what brand of infa|my &s;hall we de&s;erve, if we will take no pains to re&s;cue our riche&s;t trea&s;ures and brighte&s;t orna|ments from perpetual ob&s;curity!</P>
<P>IF we look into our new &s;ettlements of le&s;s than twenty years &s;tanding, &s;hall we not find a great number of per&s;ons, now in the bloom of youth, who &s;carce ever had an opportunity to enter the doors of a &s;chool; who, if their parents are un|able to teach them, mu&s;t remain de&s;titute of the fir&s;t rudiments of education; the&s;e youth are to be the future &s;trength and &s;upport of the State; and what a &s;et of men will by and by come upon the &s;tage under all the&s;e di&s;advantages! How me|lancholy to think that a great part of the ri&s;ing generation is likely to be ignorant &amp; unprincipled! that our town-officers, our jurors, ju&s;tices, judges, and even our legi&s;lators may in &s;ome future time be compo&s;ed of &s;uch per&s;ons!</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="018927_0017_0FA90A69C0633E40">IN &s;ome of our old towns the ca&s;e has of late years been not much better, I &s;ay, of late, becau&s;e there is certainly a difference between former and later times in this re&s;pect. I could produce you a proof from the public records, that in the year 1722, at the beginning of an indian war, one of the then frontier-towns was obliged to petition the General Court, and a &s;pecial act was made to relea&s;e them from the obligation of maintain|ing a Grammar School, becau&s;e of the danger and di&s;tre&s;s ari&s;ing from the war, then carried on at their doors; but this favor could not then be granted them, but on this expre&s;s condition, that they &s;hould maintain an inferior &s;chool during the whole of that war. Now mark the contra&s;t! In the late war, not only that, but many other towns, large and opulent, and far enough re|moved from all fear of the enemy, were de&s;titute of public &s;chools of any kind, not only without leave of the legi&s;lature, but contrary to the ex|pre&s;s requirement of law, and notwith&s;tand|ing courts of ju&s;tice were frequently held in &s;ome of them, and juries &s;olemnly &s;worn and charged to pre&s;ent all breaches of law, and the want of &s;chools among the re&s;t. What could this inat|tention be owing to? Could it be imagined that in a time of war, education was unnece&s;&s;ary? or
<PB N="18" REF="018927_0018_0FA90A6A8542CD40">
that it did not tend to qualify men for &s;oldiers? It is well known, and the late war has proved it over again, if it needed proof, that the men of this State are an hardy robu&s;t race, patient of fatigue, inured to hard&s;hips, and able to look an enemy in the face without terror; the&s;e qualities are e&s;&s;ential to a good &s;oldier: I &s;uppo&s;e too, that when commanded by officers in whom they can confide, they are at lea&s;t equal to any of their American brethren for di&s;cipline and &s;ubordina|tion; but in the pre&s;ent mode of conducting war, &s;ome degree of learning is nece&s;&s;ary to qua|lify even the&s;e men for a command: A &s;oldier cannot ri&s;e to the rank of an orderly &s;erjeant with|out &s;ome knowledge of letters: and what a pity is it, that for want of in&s;truction in this u&s;eful branch of &s;cience, the brave&s;t men &s;hould &s;tand no chance for preferment.</P>
<P>WITH regard to civil &s;ociety, the pro&s;pect is truly alarming. Our notions of liberty, if they are not guided and limited by good education, degenerate into a &s;avage independence.

than their own wills; when they are injured they &s;eek to revenge them&s;elves, and, when they are op|po&s;ed to any public mea&s;ure, they think that their appearing and voting or prote&s;ting again&s;t it, will free them from the obligation of abiding by the &s;en&s;e of the majority. But &s;hould any length of time or turn of affairs blunt the&s;e &s;en&s;ations of freedom which are now all alive, and impatient of controul, then without the means of education, how ea&s;ily may our po&s;terity be gulled out of their liberties by an artful and in&s;idious few, who may have all the wealth and learning in their hands; If town &s;chools be not encouraged, if education be not laid open and common to every family of whatever e&s;tate and condition, the rich only will be able to cultivate the minds of their children by &s;ending them to di&s;tant academies or univer&s;ities; the learning of the country will then be only among men of property, and the re&s;t being ignorant, may be ea&s;ily deceived. How fa|vorable &s;uch a circum&s;tance may prove to u&s;ur|pation and tyranny&punc; I dread to think!

and what that will degenerate into, let the nature of a&s;piring ambition, and the hi&s;tories of fallen republics tell.</P>
<P>IF we turn our attention to the religious &s;tate of the country, what an ill a&s;pect has the want of education on &s;ociety? the religion of ignorant people is &s;uper&s;tition. Having no foundation laid in their minds by regular in&s;truction, they will not be likely to think &s;oberly or rationally of any article of faith or moral duty. They will not candidly enquire and impartially determine what is truth and what is duty; but will either take their religion upon tru&s;t from human autho|rity, or be &s;ubject to frights and fits, and delu|&s;ions: Any bold and cunning impo&s;ters will lead them a&s;tray, their imaginations will be tickled with novelties, or their fears excited by har&s;h &s;ounds; and they will pro&s;titute their affections to tho&s;e who pretend a love for them, but who&s;e only aim is to make a prey of their &s;ub&s;tance. They will be led to believe pretended prophe&s;ies and pre|tended miracles; they will "<HI>learn the way of the heathen, and be di&s;mayed at the &s;igns of heaven</HI>;" they will think rocks and mountains inhabited by evil &s;pirits; they will believe in witchcraft and &s;or|cery; and will pay more regard to the tricks of

conjurers and fortune-tellers, than to the &s;acred truths of divine Revelation.</P>
<P>BUT it may be &s;aid, why all this complaint about education; have we not already laws that provide for the public teaching of youth? and is there not an order of men appointed to take notice of and pre&s;ent the towns for non-compli|ance? It may be an&s;wered, we have indeed &s;uch laws; but are they not like a decayed building that needs repairs? As to the bu&s;ine&s;s of grand-jurors if we were to judge by their oath, we &s;hould certainly think they had enough to do; when we hear them &s;worn
<Q>diligently to enquire, and true pre&s;entment to make of all &s;uch matters and things as &s;hall be given them in charge; that they &s;hall pre&s;ent no man for envy, hatred or malice, neither leave any unpre&s;ented for love, fear, favor, affection or hope of reward; but &s;hall pre&s;ent things truly as they come to their knowledge, according to the be&s;t of their un|der&s;tanding;</Q>
when we hear this oath admini&s;|tred, and a charge from the bench, explaining and enforcing the duty, any man of common under|&s;tanding would think that the grand-jurors had a large field of action open before them. But if we are to judge by their practice, we may be apt to &s;u&s;pect

that there is a certain magic power in that oath, which at once deprives a man of the &s;en&s;es of &s;ee|ing and hearing, and of the faculty of &s;peech.

Let this important work be ef|fectually done, and let it be &s;aid that where there was the mo&s;t need of education, the be&s;t means have been u&s;ed, and the mo&s;t generous remedies faithfully applied. <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>Dr. PRICE in his ob&s;ervations on the American revolution earne&s;tly recommends to us "the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a wi&s;e and libe|ral plan of education," and gives it as his opinion, that there is

"The bu&s;ine&s;s of education &s;ays he, &s;hould be to teach <HI>how to think,</HI> rather than "<HI>what to think.</HI>" Is it not equally u&s;e|ful to be taught how to <HI>act?</HI> Is it not an object of as great im|portance that youth &s;hould be led to admire and approve what is noble, generous and worthy, and to abhor what is vicious, mean and dete&s;table, as that they &s;hould learn the rudiments of grammar, and the beauties of &s;tyle and compo&s;ition? and if the &s;ame precept|or, the &s;ame books, and the &s;ame time may be employed in pro|moting both the&s;e purpo&s;es, would it not be a &s;pecies of literary oeconomy worth attending to? Suppo&s;e the ma&s;ter &s;hould &s;et apart one day in the week to put his pupils on reviewing what they have learned, not merely with a view to perfect them in the grammatical con&s;truction of words and &s;entences, or the beauties of rhetorical dic|tion; but to dive into the &s;entiments of the books or parts of books of which they have &s;kimmed the &s;urface, and &s;hould examine them concerning the per&s;ons or things, of which the author treats, <HI>lead|ing them to find out</HI> principles and manners, virtues and vices, and how to prai&s;e or blame, to imitate, correct or avoid; would not this one day be as well &s;pent as any other, and would not youth be put into a way of critici&s;ing per&s;ons and things, as well as words and phra&s;es? would they not learn a method of reading, ob&s;erving, enquiring, and judging which might fit them for u&s;efulne&s;s in every &s;tage of life, and in every branch of bu&s;ine&s;s?

natural &s;ource of that equality and independence, which are e&s;&s;ential to a republican government. Heaven hath ble&s;&s;ed us with a variety of &s;oils. Mountains, vallies, plains and meadows appear in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the eye of the traveller; and the&s;e are capable of producing every &s;ort of nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;upport of man and bea&s;t. We need be at no lo&s;s for &s;taple commodities, if we will but at|tend to the hints which nature hath given us, and improve the advantages which &s;he hath put into our hands. The increa&s;e of our corn and cattle ought to be a principal object of the legi&s;lator's care. England, it is &s;aid, was not a corn country, 'till the parliament about a century ago, e&s;tabli&s;hed a bounty upon the exportation of it. This en|couraged the rai&s;ing of great quantities, more than &s;ufficient for home con&s;umption. Such a mea&s;ure might be equally beneficial here, if our &s;ituation was not &s;o very inconvenient, that the only &s;ea-port in the State is, and always will be unfrequented, by a great part of the inland coun|try, who&s;e commodities will find an ea&s;ier tran&s;|portation to other places.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Any per&s;on by ca&s;ting his eye on a map of New-Hamp&s;hire, and the country ea&s;tward of it mu&s;t be convinced, that the whole territory between the upper part of Connecticut river, on the we&s;t, and the Ocean as far as the river Kennebeck, on the ea&s;t, and as far northward as the bounds of the United States extend, is formed by nature to have a nece&s;&s;ary connexion, and ought in rea&s;on to be one juri&s;diction. The dividing line between New-Hamp&s;hire and the late Province of Main cuts this territory in &s;uch a manner as to make two juri&s;dictions extremely inconvenient.

<P><PB N="26" REF="018927_0026_0FA90A72C0F98EB8">OUR inland navigation is another branch of improvement which merits attention.

<P>OUR manufactures are few, and mu&s;t be &s;o, while land is plenty and cheap.

<P>LET no man here take an alarm as if by a nation|al religion, I would recommend the e&s;tabli&s;hment of any modes or forms in preference to others. The world has too long been abu&s;ed with attempts to impo&s;e uniformity; and our con&s;titution has wi&s;ely avoided that fatal rock, on which con|&s;cience and truth have often &s;uffered &s;hipwreck. By a national religion I would be under&s;tood to mean, an acknowledgement of the being, perfec|tions and providence of one &s;upreme GOD; a &s;en&s;e of his moral government both in this and a future State; and a careful ob&s;ervance of the eternal laws of ju&s;tice, truth and mercy in all our pub|lic conduct. If the&s;e principles be admitted into
<PB N="35" REF="018927_0035_0FA90A7AF99C2F28">
our national councils, and our national character be formed upon them, we may truly be &s;aid to have the LORD for our GOD, however different our &s;peculations or practice may be as individuals or religious &s;ocieties. The&s;e are principles in which hone&s;t men of all denominations will agree; and if by a &s;trict adherence to them we acknow|ledge GOD in all our public ways, we &s;hall have rea&s;on to hope and believe that he will direct our &s;teps.</P>
<P>IT is not an uncommon thing for per&s;ons who are a&s;hamed to appear irreligious or immoral in their private conduct, when they come into pub|lic life, and act as members of a political body, to lay a&s;ide all &s;en&s;e of GOD and duty, and act only ac|cording to craft or policy or conveniency. Whether they think that the State has no &s;uch thing as a public con&s;cience; or that the blame being di|vided among &s;o many, each one's &s;hare is too tri|fling to be regarded; or, whether they have any thought upon the matter at all, may not be ea&s;y to determine, but it is to be feared the fact is true, and that the public have often felt the ill con&s;e|quence of it. When public men act thus, they certainly have not the fear of GOD before their eyes; and to what purpo&s;e do they, as men, pro|fe&s;s to know the true GOD, when&punc; as rulers, they
<PB N="36" REF="018927_0036_0FA90A7B0CCE7528">
have not &s;o much religion as many of the old heathens? How many illu&s;trious examples might be brought from antiquity, of men who had no more exalted idea of the Deity than that he re|&s;ided on Mount Olympus, or in &s;ome "<HI>temple made with hands,</HI>" and yet in all their public conduct acted with a &s;acred regard to ju&s;tice and truth, and a firm conviction that their actions were regarded by a &s;uperior Being, on who&s;e favor depended all the national pro&s;perity! Such examples may ju&s;tly put many to the blu&s;h, who profe&s;s a purer reli|gion, but form not their conduct by its heavenly dictates.</P>
<P>IF we would be an happy people, we mu&s;t as a people, "<HI>have the</HI> LORD <HI>for our</HI> GOD." Our pub|lic men mu&s;t have &s;o much religion as to believe that GOD is a witne&s;s to all their public conduct, and requires that it be conformable to the rules of righteou&s;ne&s;s. When they enter the court-chamber, they &s;hould recollect that they are in the pre&s;ence of the Supreme Ruler. In all their debates, their votes and acts they &s;hould con&s;ider, not merely what will &s;erve a turn, or plea&s;e their con&s;tituents; but what is right and ju&s;t; what will &s;tand the te&s;t of rea&s;on and truth; and what will GOD approve. It would not be ami&s;s if every night the public actions of
<PB N="37" REF="018927_0037_0FA90A7BC384DD18">
the day were reviewed with &s;uch &s;elf-enquiries as the&s;e,
<Q>what have I done this day, to &s;erve the true intere&s;t of my country? what motives and con&s;iderations have I been governed by, whether of intere&s;t or policy? and how have they corre&s;|ponded with the unchangeable rules of rea&s;on, truth and ju&s;tice?</Q>
The&s;e reflections may be equally u&s;eful to all executive and judicial officers, and to every man acting in a public capacity. If all &s;uch men would form their conduct on &s;uch a plan&punc; or if the people would chu&s;e into office none but per&s;ons who appear to be governed by &s;uch principles, we &s;hould be regarded by the &s;earcher of hearts as a people fearing the LORD, and might on good grounds expect that our national virtues would be rewarded with national ble&s;&s;ings.</P>
<P>I have now fini&s;hed what I propo&s;ed to &s;ay from the hints offered to us in the text; and if I have not already wearied your patience, would a&s;k your attention a little longer, while I endeavor to lead you into &s;ome reflections which may &s;erve to en|force the foregoing con&s;iderations, as duties pecu|liarly required of us at this day.</P>
<P>DIVINE providence has not only given us a good land to live in, but has di&s;appointed the at|tempts and expectations of enemies of various kinds, both in former and later times, to di&s;po&s;|&s;e&s;s

us of it, or &s;ubject us to their dominion. A foreign government was always inconvenient, and, as it was at la&s;t managed, grew in&s;upportable. GOD, who has made every country &s;ufficient to govern it&s;elf, &s;miled on our &s;truggles for emancipation, and conducted us through a long cour&s;e of diffi|culties, to a &s;tate of freedom and peace. And now that we have e&s;caped and are at re&s;t, it will be of u&s;e to us, like the &s;eaman when he has braved the fury of the waves, and got &s;afe on &s;hore, to look back on the dangers through which we have pa&s;&s;|ed, and the narrow e&s;capes which we have expe|rienced, and &s;ee by what means our deliverance has been accompli&s;hed, with a grateful &s;en&s;e of the divine goodne&s;s, and a re&s;olution to improve our pre&s;ent advantages to the noble&s;t purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>IT is indeed a&s;toni&s;hing that &s;o enlightened a nation as Britain, which has produced &s;o many wi&s;e and learned men, who were able clearly to fore&s;ee and predict, and &s;ome of them publicly and faithfully to warn the nation of the con&s;e|quences of engaging in a quarrel with us, &s;hould ru&s;h &s;o blindly and head&s;trong as they did into a controver&s;y, which has di&s;membered their empire, and di&s;graced their characters, and given them "<HI>a wound which no time can heal.</HI>" <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot"><P>This &s;entiment is quoted from the conclu&s;ion of a truly pro|phetic &s;peech delivered by the celebrated author of LEONIDAS, Mr. GLOVER, when he appeared before the Hou&s;e of Commons, March 1775, as agent for the We&s;t-India merchants, to &s;upport their petition again&s;t the bill then pending to re&s;train and ruin our fi&s;hery.

If we derived &s;trong con|&s;olation from this prophecy in the height of the war, we mu&s;t have proportionable &s;ati&s;faction in &s;eeing the conclu&s;ion of it verify the prediction, and an additional evidence thereby adduced to the truth of divine revelation. We mu&s;t then believe that the &s;eperation which has been made, was the re&s;ult of cau&s;es, which were fore&s;een and foretold, by him to whom all his works are fully known from the beginning. All the wi&s;dom of the wi&s;e&s;t, all the oratory of the mo&s;t eloquent,
<PB N="40" REF="018927_0040_0FA90A7E02A7DAF8">
and all the &s;trength of the mo&s;t powerful could not fru&s;trate the decree of heaven, that America mu&s;t be &s;eperated from Brittain. She pretended a right to this country, and a&s;&s;umed to grant it to us; but our right is &s;uperior to what hers ever was. We have purcha&s;ed it of its native lords, we have &s;ubdued it, we have peopled it, we have defended it, we have paid the price of it over and over again, we have paid it not only in our &s;ub&s;tance and labour, but in blood, in the rich blood of our fathers, and brethren and chil|dren. It is then mo&s;t a&s;&s;uredly ours, and he who hath given it to us requires us to pre&s;erve it, and govern it, and improve every one of tho&s;e advanta|ges which he hath &s;o liberally given us in it and with it; and he hath &s;o connected our duty and our intere&s;t in this, as well as every other re&s;|pect, that they are in&s;eperable.</P>
<P>IF in our &s;tate of infancy we have committed errors and blunders, this is no more than what might naturally be expected of us. We were raw and un&s;killed in government, in finances and in war. We had to contend with a rich and for|midable nation, and they who be&s;t knew her power and wealth were mo&s;t fearful of the i&s;&s;ue. We had to &s;eek re&s;ources, and invent means of rai&s;ing &s;upplies. We were &s;everal months after the war

began learning to fabricate materials for carrying it on; and we were &s;everal years after that &s;triv|ing to create money and enforce its credit; to regulate prices and command trade. All that time our enemies were expending their money and &s;tores, teaching us how to fight, and pu&s;h|ing them&s;elves into &s;uch difficulties that with pro|per exertions on our part, and by the help of our allies, they fell into our hands by whole armies at a time; 'till wearied with their violent but inef|fectual attempts, and having run them&s;elves into a mo&s;t horrible depth of debt and mi&s;ery, they were obliged to give up the point, and leave us to our&s;elves, which was all that we de&s;ired.</P>
<P>WE have now opportunity to review the whole &s;cene, to &s;ee how much providence hath done for us, and how we have been &s;aved with an high hand. In con&s;equence of this deliverance, we have had the privilege, &s;carce ever granted to any people before, deliberately, and without fear or re&s;traint from any foreign cau&s;es&punc; to form and re&s;olve upon a plan of government for our&s;elves and our po&s;|terity; and if it does not an&s;wer the end for which it was de&s;igned, we have re&s;erved to our&s;elves the liberty to revi&s;e and alter it at a future period. Are not our obligations to the divine goodne&s;s exceeding great? are we not "<HI>a people &s;aved of the</HI>

LORD, <HI>who is the &s;hield of our help and the &s;word of our excellency?</HI>" and what is required of us in gratitude to our Supreme Ruler and bountiful benefactor, but to govern our&s;elves by the laws of ju&s;tice and truth, and to improve to our utmo&s;t the rich gifts of his paternal providence?</P>
<P>AS the divine coun&s;els are opened to us by the events of time, we have rea&s;on to believe, that one great end which GOD had in view, in the origi|nal di&s;covery of this American continent, and in baffling all the attempts which European princes have made, to &s;ubject it to their dominion, and in giving us quiet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it as our own land, was, that it might prove an a&s;&s;ylum for the op|pre&s;&s;ed and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed in other parts of the world. Our fathers fled hither from the per&s;ecutions which they endured in England; and many thou|&s;ands of oppre&s;&s;ed people in the Briti&s;h dominions as well as Germany have fled for refuge to Ame|rica already; many more are daily coming, and the reputation of this country is daily ri&s;ing all over Europe. Our mode of living, and the divi|&s;ion of property among us being different from that in the old countries, are circum&s;tances, very inviting to foreigners. As in the &s;ea, the great fi&s;h devour the &s;maller, &s;o in tho&s;e countries, the landed intere&s;t is in the hands of a few, and the
<PB N="43" REF="018927_0043_0FA90A81F3336048">
re&s;t are dependent on them: here property is more equally divided, and the chance of acquiring it is much more in favor of the poor, if they be hone&s;t and indu&s;trious; and intere&s;t being a pre|vailing principle with all men they are naturally prompted to pur&s;ue it in the mo&s;t likely and &s;hort|e&s;t cour&s;e. From the&s;e cau&s;es we may expect a rapid population of this exten&s;ive country; and when we con&s;ider the agency of divine providence in &s;ucceeding our late attempt to &s;eperate our|&s;elves from foreign dependence, we mu&s;t believe that GOD had therein not only a kind intention toward us, but toward mankind in general, open|ing a place for them to flee to from the poverty, oppre&s;&s;ion and di&s;tre&s;s, which are &s;o prevalent in other countries. This may &s;erve in time to hum|ble the haughty &s;pirit of &s;ome of the European princes and nobles, and induce them to treat their &s;ubjects and va&s;&s;als with more lenity, and &s;o be the means of exten&s;ive benefit to mankind; but whether it &s;hould have that effect on them or not, it will be our wi&s;dom and intere&s;t to let mankind know that here is a good country, in which they may find &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, and good government, where they may be &s;ecure from oppre&s;&s;ion, and enjoy their liberty.</P>
<P>WHILE we are reaping the fruit of our &s;trug|gles and &s;ufferings, while we are enjoying our
<PB N="44" REF="018927_0044_0FA90A82B9540E50">
hou&s;es, fields, families, and privileges civil and religious, can we forget the GOD to who&s;e gracious interpo&s;ition we owe the&s;e ble&s;&s;ings? had not he defeated the ho&s;tile de&s;igns formed again&s;t us, we might by this time have been a mi|&s;erably oppre&s;&s;ed and en&s;laved people. Tho&s;e who hated us would have been our rulers; our lands would have been located to petty tyrants; our trade burdened with every kind of re&s;triction; our taxes &s;evere, and without end; tho&s;e who complain of taxes now, would have had tenfold more cau&s;e of complaint; we mu&s;t have been held in the mo&s;t rigorous &s;ubjection; or have been driven back into the wilderne&s;s to herd among the &s;avages, de&s;pi&s;ed and dete&s;ted even by them. Our circum&s;tances now are in &s;ome re&s;pects dif|ficult; but how much wor&s;e they would have been, if the arms of Britain had prevailed, let the mi&s;erable inhabitants of India tell.</P>
<P>IT is one of the weakne&s;&s;es of human nature, that we never enjoy our&s;elves &s;o well as when we have &s;ome kind of mi&s;ery before our eyes, or within our contemplation. He who has been &s;ick, or &s;ees another &s;ick, has an higher reli&s;h of health than he who never knew what &s;ickne&s;s was. He who is delivered from confinement, or &s;ees others enduring it, has a proportionably higher &s;en&s;e of
<PB N="45" REF="018927_0045_0FA90A8340042A68">
the value of liberty: &s;o when we view our fel|low-men in bondage, and feel our&s;elves free; or, when we find our&s;elves delivered from the fear of &s;lavery, and &s;ecured in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of liberty, we enjoy a greater &s;atisfaction and plea&s;ure, than if we had never &s;een or known re&s;traint. Let a &s;en&s;e of the value of the&s;e ble&s;&s;ings rai&s;e our ar|dent gratitude to our divine Benefactor, and let this gratitude be expre&s;&s;ed in the mo&s;t effectual manner, by making a right u&s;e of his gifts, and improving them to tho&s;e purpo&s;es for which he hath be&s;towed them upon us.</P>
<P>MY re&s;pected audience will, I doubt not, find &s;ufficient rea&s;on for the omi&s;&s;ion of per&s;onal ad|dre&s;&s;es, and compliments on this occa&s;ion. Pub|lic prai&s;e when rightly be&s;towed, is a reward of &s;ervices performed. The man of true merit will not &s;eek the prai&s;e of his country but by earning it. He will be content to wait for his reward 'till his work is done; and when he is con&s;cious that he has done his be&s;t, he will have a &s;atisfaction in his mind, which though it may be increa&s;ed by the applau&s;e of his countrymen, yet cannot be di|mini&s;hed by their neglect, nor even by their mi&s;|taken cen&s;ures and di&s;approbation. To do real &s;ervice to his country is the aim of the patriot; applau&s;e is but an accidental thing, which he may
<PB N="46" REF="018927_0046_0FA90A845243CFD0">
either get or mi&s;s in the cour&s;e of his &s;ervices, but which is not the principal object of his concern. Such men only are fit for public offices; and it is our hope that tho&s;e gentlemen who are now by the &s;uffrages of the people, or who may by the favor of their Repre&s;entatives be advanced to the &s;eats of government, will prove them&s;elves worthy of the tru&s;t repo&s;ed in them, by di&s;charging it with fidelity.</P>
<P>UNDER &s;uch a con&s;titution as we now enjoy, where every man is an elector, and many per&s;ons at once capable of being elected, it is our wi&s;dom and intere&s;t to be well acquainted with each other. Tho&s;e who are placed in a public light as candi|dates for honor and power, mu&s;t not think it &s;trange if their characters &s;hould undergo a pub|lic &s;crutiny: it is a tribute which they mu&s;t pay to the con&s;titution, and if they &s;tand the te&s;t, the laurel when obtained will &s;it more gracefully on their brow. But it becomes us to be exceedingly careful whom we elect. Though it may not be &s;trictly true that the con&s;titution "which is be&s;t admini&s;tred is be&s;t;" &Dagger; yet it is certain that the be&s;t con&s;titution which can be formed, may by bad ma|nagement be &s;o perverted, as not to an&s;wer the end of government &s;o well as one of inferior goodne&s;s well admini&s;tred. So much depends on the right u&s;e of the powers of government, that
<PB N="47" REF="018927_0047_0FA90A85C980D898">
we cannot be too careful in our choice of rulers nor too vigilant of the u&s;e which they make of the powers delegated to them. But the be&s;t of men may err; and if the error be &s;udden and in|voluntary, if it be not per&s;i&s;ted in, but as far as po&s;&s;ible retracted, it ought &s;urely to be forgiven. Government is a weighty ta&s;k, and they who bear the burden on their &s;houlders have every claim to a fair and candid interpretation of their conduct.</P>
<P>FOR a conclu&s;ion, let me remind this whole audience, that the be&s;t forms of human govern|ment are of them&s;elves in&s;ufficient to protect man|kind from in&s;ult and inva&s;ion, and to pre|&s;erve to them the invaluable ble&s;&s;ings of "peace, liberty and &s;afety" for any long duration. The lu&s;ts of men will produce wars and tumults, di&s;|affection and u&s;urpation, which will lead to revo|lutions and conque&s;ts. Why is all this mi&s;ery per|mitted in a world that is governed by infinite wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s? Is it not to &s;hew us that we are not to regard this as our final &s;tate, and to induce us to look forward with joyful expectation to that grand period, when the prince of peace &s;hall &s;ubdue all things to him&s;elf? Every &s;pecies of human govern|ment contains the &s;eeds of di&s;&s;olution, which will &s;ome time or other work its ruin; but the king|dom of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> being founded in eternal righ|teou&s;ne&s;s,
<PB N="48" REF="018927_0048_0FA90A864308F270">
&s;upported by almighty power, and con|ducted by infinite wi&s;dom and benevolence, mu&s;t an&s;wer the end of government, and therefore mu&s;t end in perfection. When the periods of the king|doms of this world are &s;poken of in &s;cripture, they are &s;aid to "<HI>be de&s;troyed</HI>" to "<HI>pa&s;s away</HI>" and to "<HI>be broken in pieces</HI>; but the con&s;ummation of the kingdom of Chri&s;t is repre&s;ented by its being "<HI>delivered up into the hands of</HI> GOD <HI>the Father,</HI>" as having completely attained the great end, for which it was erected.</P>
<P>HOW happy then are they who have in their hearts &s;ubmitted to this glorious King, and have formed them&s;elves on the wi&s;e and peaceful max|ims of his government; and how truly happy will mankind be, when this kingdom which now like "<HI>a &s;tone cut out without hands</HI>" is "<HI>&s;miting the image on its feet</HI>" &s;hall "<HI>become a great mountain and fill the whole earth.</HI>" In the pro&s;pect of that illu&s;|trious day, let us anticipate the &s;ong which we &s;hall hereafter &s;ing in concert with "<HI>every crea|ture in heaven and earth." "Ble&s;&s;ing and honor and glory and power be to him that &s;itteth on the throne, and to the Lamb forever and ever.</HI>" AMEN.</P>
