<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<P>WHAT I write is with a view to explain my own con|duct, which has not been under&s;tood. It is po&s;&s;ible I may not be able to remove the mi&s;conception of every one. I am aware how difficult it is to change opinion, even with the be&s;t cau&s;e on my &s;ide: But I may &s;upport tho&s;e who have un|dertaken my defence in conver&s;ation; and it may &s;atisfy others, who are di&s;po&s;ed to find men innocent rather than criminal.</P>
<P>ON the evening of the 14th of July, David Lenox, mar&s;hal of the di&s;trict of Penn&s;ylvania, was introduced to me at my hou&s;e. I had heard that he had been, on his way, &s;erving proce&s;s, on delinquent di&s;tillers, in the intermediate counties from Philadelphia to the we&s;tern country; and in the we&s;tern country it&s;elf. The conver&s;ation turned on this &s;ubject; and the mar&s;hal expre&s;&s;ed, with great &s;en&s;ibility, his &s;atisfaction, in having met with no in&s;ult, much le&s;s injury, in the execution of his duty. My impre&s;&s;ion was that of &s;urpri&s;e, that he &s;hould have apprehended any. For, though the people had been in the habit of thinking it no incon&s;i&s;tency with the reputation of a good citizen, to in&s;ult or abu&s;e an exci&s;e officer; yet I had con&s;idered them as di&s;tingui&s;hing between the&s;e, and other of|ficers of government. For though outrages had been commit|ted on exci&s;e officers, yet no &s;heriff, nor con&s;table, had been oppo&s;ed in arre&s;ting the offenders. They had been brought in upon proce&s;s, and pro&s;ecuted at the court. There was no rea|&s;on in the di&s;tinction; but it was made. It was owing to this;
<PB N="6" REF="028332_0003_0FD899AF01AF1F30">
that the exci&s;e law was odious, and the public voice again&s;t the officers; but the office of &s;heriff, or con&s;table, carried with it the authority of law, which the people had been in the habit of re&s;pecting; and the oppo&s;ing which would be con&s;idered infa|mous, in public opinion. I had &s;uppo&s;ed they would have con|&s;idered the mar&s;hal in the light of a &s;heriff, or judicial officer, and would not mole&s;t him. However, it &s;o happened, that I was mi&s;taken in my confidence of his &s;ecurity; for the evening of the next day, having been out in company with the in&s;pec|tor of the revenue for the di&s;trict, John Neville, &s;erving &s;ome remaining writs upon di&s;tillers, in the county of Alleghany, he returned with an unfavourable account of his reception. He had &s;erved the la&s;t writ he had to &s;erve, in that quarter, and had ju&s;t quitted the hou&s;e of a di&s;tiller, of the name of Miller, when a number of men were ob&s;erved to be in pur&s;uit of them, and a gun was di&s;charged. The mar&s;hal conceiving it not to be with a view to injure, but intimidate, turned and expo&s;tu|lated. But ob&s;erving a &s;ullenne&s;s of countenance, and advi&s;ed by the in&s;pector, who knew their di&s;po&s;ition better, he thought proper to ride off, and e&s;cape from them; and had come to town. The in&s;pector had gone to his own hou&s;e, about 7 miles from Pitt&s;burg, and about the &s;am<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> di&s;tance from the hou&s;e of Miller.</P>
<P>The next morning, after day-break, the in&s;pector having ju&s;t got out of bed, and opened the door, di&s;covered a number of armed men, about the hou&s;e; and demanding of them who they were, and whence they came; the an&s;wer was &s;uch, as induced him to con&s;ider their intention to be ho&s;tile; and on their refu&s;ing to di&s;per&s;e, he fired on them. The fire was returned, and a conte&s;t en&s;ued. The negroes, from &s;ome adjoining &s;mall buildings, fired upon the flank of the a&s;&s;ailants, and they were repul&s;ed, with &s;ix wounded; one mortally. The in&s;pector or his family received no injury; his hou&s;e, which was a frame building, was perforated with the balls.</P>
<P>Towards the middle of the next day, the &s;on of the in&s;pect|or, Pre&s;ley Neville, who re&s;ided in the town of Pitt&s;burgh, read a letter from his father, written at his hou&s;e in the country, informing, that a large number were &s;aid to be collecting at a place known by the name of Couche's fort, about four miles di&s;tant from his hou&s;e. The &s;on expre&s;&s;ed to me his apprehen|&s;ions for the &s;ituation of his father. It was a&s;ked by me, What he under&s;tood to be their object? It was an&s;wered, To demand
<PB N="7" REF="028332_0004_0FD899B077D987F8">
of his father, to deliver up his commi&s;&s;ion. Deliver it, &s;aid I. It was an&s;wered, No.</P>
<P>My idea was, to put by the tempe&s;t for the pre&s;ent, until the civil authority could interpo&s;e, and bring to account indi|vidually, tho&s;e who had di&s;turbed the peace. If the mob who burned the hou&s;e of lord Mansfield, in the riot in London, could have been put off by his delivering his commi&s;&s;ion, I pre&s;ume he would have delivered it. Another could ea&s;ily have been made out for him.</P>
<P>It may be &s;aid, that it would have occurred to a good citizen, to give a&s;&s;i&s;tance to the in&s;pector, and to help him to defend his hou&s;e: and that the gallant and &s;ucce&s;sful defence, which had been made the preceding morning, gave ground of re&s;olu|tion to attempt defence again&s;t a farther force. But I ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;hed between the &s;urpri&s;e of an unexpected re&s;i&s;tance, and the deliberation where it is expected. It was al&s;o under|&s;tood, from the letter of the in&s;pector, that a much more con|&s;iderable force, perhaps five hundred men, were &s;aid to be col|lecting. I ea&s;ily conceived, that, as the di&s;a&s;ter of the fir&s;t at|tack had brought a &s;econd, the repul&s;e of a &s;econd would bring a third; and the numbers, and the rage, would increa&s;e. I am not a fighting man; and it was mo&s;t natural for me to think of policy, and the giving the rioters the piece of paper which they had their minds upon, and let the ju&s;tices of the peace, the con&s;tables, the &s;heriffs, the grand juries of the courts, &s;ettle it with them afterwards. It may be &s;aid, they could not have been brought to ju&s;tice. That might have been the ca&s;e; but I thought at the time they could.</P>
<P>In the afternoon of the day, John Wilkins, junior, of Pitt&s;|burgh, a brigadier general of the militia, calling upon me, in|formed me, that a demand by Neville the younger, on behalf of his father, had been made of John Gib&s;on, major general of the militia, and of him&s;elf, as brigadier general, to call out the militia, in order to &s;uppre&s;s the rioters; and wi&s;hed to have my opinion, as to their authority to call them out. Having given the que&s;tion a &s;hort con&s;ideration, I thought they had not the power. The governor, under an article of the con&s;titution, has, con&s;tructively, the power: "He &s;hall take care that the laws be faithfully executed." And by an act of the legi&s;lature, of April 11th, 1783, he is expre&s;sly empowered, "to call in|to actual &s;ervice, whenever it may be nece&s;&s;ary, part of the militia, in ca&s;e of rebellion, or of an actual, or threatened in|va&s;ion." But it appeared to me, that the con&s;titution, and
<PB N="8" REF="028332_0005_0FD899B4F1B87848">
the act, con&s;titutes the governor the judge of the occa&s;ion; and that it is not in his power to delegate this di&s;cretion, or con|&s;titute another the judge of it. But if he could, on enquiring of general Wilkins, I found the fact to be, that he had not de|legated this di&s;cretion, or con&s;tituted the&s;e officers the judges of the occa&s;ion of calling out the militia; no provi&s;ional in&s;truc|tions, as in the ca&s;e of an Indian inva&s;ion, having been given, that re&s;pected an oppo&s;ition to the laws, or a rebellion<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A letter from the governor, to major general Gib&s;on, of the 25th of July, when the account of the attack upon the hou&s;e of the in&s;pector had reached the government, contained no orders for calling out the militia. It evident, from the report of his &s;ecretary, Mr. Dallas, to the legi&s;lature of the &s;tate, of February 13th, 1795, that the governor had not thought him&s;elf ju&s;tifiable, on this emergency, in calling out the militia. The fol|lowing is an extract from that report: "No po&s;itive law exi&s;ted, under the authority of the &s;tate, defining the emergency that could ju&s;tify an ap|peal from the judicial to the military power; o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> regulating, or pre&s;cribing the evidence, that &s;hould prove the occurrence of the exigency. Whatever, therefore, might eventually b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the obligation, re&s;ulting from the con&s;titu|tional injunction, to take care that the laws be faithfully executed, it was thought, that not only the non execution of the laws, and the incompetency of the courts of ju&s;tice to puni&s;h offenders, &s;hould fir&s;t be authoritatively declared, by the judicial magi&s;tra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">; but that the act of interpo&s;ing the aid of the military power, &s;hould likewi&s;e be founded upon their requi&s;ition."</NOTE>.</P>
<P>General Wilkins returned to me a &s;hort time afterwards; and &s;aid, that Neville the younger had called upon John Gib&s;on and him&s;elf, as judges of the court, to rai&s;e the po&s;&s;e of the county, and he wi&s;hed my opinion with re&s;pect to their power in this ca&s;e. Giving it a &s;hort con&s;ideration, I was of opinion, that they had not the power. By the con&s;titution, the judges of the court are ju&s;tices of the peace, &s;o far as relates to criminal matters. A ju&s;tice of the peace, on information given, can di|rect his warrant to the con&s;tables, to apprehend offenders; or, on an affray in his pre&s;ence, can command a&s;&s;i&s;tance to &s;uppre&s;s it. But it did not appear to me, that he could rai&s;e the po&s;&s;e of the county. But, &s;aid I, the &s;heriff can.&mdash;He is in town; let him be called upon.</P>
<P>Judge Wilkins left me; and in a &s;hort time returned, and &s;aid, the &s;heriff doubted his authority. Judge Wilkins wi&s;hed me to explain it to him. I &s;aid I was ready. He left me, and in a &s;hort time I received a note from him, reque&s;ting my company at the public hou&s;e, whence the note was dated. I attended in&s;tantly, and found there judge Gib&s;on, judge M'Dow|el, and the &s;heriff of the county. I was reque&s;ted by judge Wilkins, to explain to the &s;heriff his authority. I did &s;o, fully.
<PB N="9" REF="028332_0006_0FD8858BE4E37B40">
The &s;heriff appeared alarmed at the ta&s;k of rai&s;ing the po&s;&s;e, and thought it not practicable. I was a&s;ked my opinion. I do not recollect from whom the que&s;tion came. I gave it decidedly, that it was not practicable: All concurred.</P>
<P>But, &s;aid I, this can be done;&mdash;ride out without arms, and addre&s;s the people. Per&s;ua&s;ion will avail more than force. If this is adopted, I will be one to go. It was agreed; and in a few minutes, I had returned to my hou&s;e, was on hor&s;eback, and at the river, to cro&s;s with the company; who were all rea|dy with the &s;ame expedition.</P>
<P>At the moment we came to the river, we fell in with Neville the younger, mar&s;hal Lenox, and a young man of the name of Orm&s;by, a &s;on of John Orm&s;by of Pitt&s;burgh, a family for whom I had regard; but knew the young man to be incon&s;id|erate and ra&s;h; and was per&s;uaded, that on this occa&s;ion he acted without the knowledge, or at lea&s;t the approbation of his parents: All three were armed, which I thought imprudent. I felt concern for them; and taking that liberty with the young man, which I could not take with the others, I addre&s;&s;ed him abruptly:&mdash;What! &s;aid I, armed? Yes, &s;aid he. You will not ride with us armed. You may ride as you plea&s;e, &s;aid he, I am armed. Neville the younger, who was mounted on a gay hor&s;e, with pi&s;tols in his hol&s;ters, &s;poke:&mdash;We are not all born orators, &s;aid he: we are going to fight; you to &s;peak. I thought him a better chevalier than a judge of the occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>But I did not know, at the time, that arrangements had been made, on their part, for a defence; tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> major Kirkpatrick, and ten or a dozen &s;oldiers from the garri&s;on of Pitt&s;burgh, had gone to the hou&s;e of the in&s;pector.</P>
<P>At the river, we found two boats. They took one, and we took the other.</P>
<P>Cro&s;&s;ing the river, being many in the boat, and cro&s;&s;ing ra|ther high, we &s;tranded the boat on the bar, the water being low; and this circum&s;tance being likely to give &s;ome delay, to lighten the boat, I leapt my hor&s;e overboard, and rode the re|mainder of the bar, and &s;wam the channel on the other &s;ide. One or two of the gentlemen in the boat, followed me, I men|tion this circum&s;tance, as marking our anxiety to reach the people.</P>
<P>A&s;cending the hill on the other &s;ide of the river, I reflected, that I had heard, that the roads to Pitt&s;burgh were guarded&punc; and that per&s;ons, that day, had been &s;topped, and interrogated, who were on their way to the town, or from it. It &s;truck me,
<PB N="10" REF="028332_0007_0FD899B90758C490">
that we might be thus &s;topped, or delayed, or prevented alto|gether from going forward. Mentioning this to the &s;heriff, who was &s;ome di&s;tance a-head with me, I enquired of him, if, riding through the country in the execution of his office, he did not know of any le&s;s public road, equally near, or not much le&s;s &s;o, than the main road, which we could take, and avoid the out parties of which I &s;poke. The &s;heriff &s;aid, he knew the old road to Couche's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">t, which was the place; and that he fre|quently took it going that cour&s;e: It was equally near, or not much le&s;s &s;o, than the new road. We waited at the fork of the road for the company, and &s;ugge&s;ting the&s;e rea&s;ons, it was agreed to take the old road. It may &s;eem trifling to mention this circum&s;tance; but it becomes material, when it is known, that it has been alledged that we quitted the main road, with a view to avoid the very object which we propo&s;ed, which was, that of falling in with the body of the people.</P>
<P>Couche's fort was about 9 miles di&s;tant: As we rode, which was with all the expedition po&s;&s;ible, we ob&s;erved the har|ve&s;t fields de&s;erted by the men; women only to be &s;een. Stop|ping at a hou&s;e, and enquiring, with a view to gain intelli|gence of the movements of the country, the woman of the hou&s;e, as we took her to be, appeared alarmed at &s;eeing us, and knowing the &s;heriff, a&s;ked him, Are you of Neville's par|ty? This impre&s;&s;ed me, as &s;hewing the popular idea, that the country was on one &s;ide, and the revenue officer on the other.</P>
<P>Reflecting on the be&s;t means of introducing our intention to the body, who were &s;uppo&s;ed to be in arms, it &s;truck me that &s;eeing the &s;heriff and the judges of the court coming forward, the fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ion would be, that it was with a view to take cognizance as civil officers of what was done, and this might make our &s;ituation dangerous. It was propo&s;ed, and agreed therefore, that the&s;e gentleman &s;hould remain, and that I, who was the only one of the company who was not a civil officer, &s;hould ride forward, and acquaint them with our views in com|ing: That it was to di&s;&s;uade and prevent, and not to take cog|nizance.</P>
<P>Coming to the hou&s;e of a certain Hul&s;e, where the&s;e gen|tlemen had propo&s;ed to &s;top, and which was half a mile off Couche's fort, we were informed that the body had marched for Neville's hou&s;e.</P>
<P>We &s;et out to overtake them, and rode with ha&s;te. Com|ing within a mile and a half of Neville's, at the hou&s;e of a doctor Adams; we learned from &s;ome who had been &s;pectators, that
<PB N="11" REF="028332_0008_0FD899BA6D71ED28">
all was over, and the hou&s;e burned; that the people were re|turning, and in great rage at the lo&s;s of their leader: This was a James M'Farlane, who, it &s;eems, commanded on that occa&s;ion. It was not thought advi&s;able for us to go forward as things now were; nor even &s;afe to remain, and be in their way, as they would mi&s;con&s;true our intention in coming; and &s;uppo&s;ing it to have been with a view of a&s;&s;i&s;ting the exci&s;e of|ficer, make us objects of their pa&s;&s;ion. We &s;et out therefore, for Pitt&s;burgh, and ri&s;ing the hill, above the hou&s;e where we had been, we &s;aw the failing flame of the burning, and heard the firing and the &s;houts of the parties on their way home from it.</P>
<P>Riding about two miles, we &s;topped at a public hou&s;e kept by a man of the name of Shochan, and under&s;tood that the tav|ern-keeper had rode towards Neville's hou&s;e to learn or ob|&s;erve what was to be done. After &s;ome time he returned, but having ob&s;erved only at a di&s;tance, he could give us no particular information. We had intended to remain at his hou&s;e until we received &s;ome farther account; but the people appearing, the woman e&s;pecially, unea&s;y at our being there, le&s;t it &s;hould be heard afterwards, and injure them, we &s;et out, and came to Pitt&s;burgh. I mention the unea&s;ine&s;s of the&s;e people, as &s;hewing the fear which was impre&s;&s;ed of &s;eeming to have had any thing to &s;ay to any one, that might be di&s;po&s;ed to take a part on behalf of the exci&s;e officer: And as officers of government, and from the town, that &s;u&s;picion might ly a|gain&s;t &s;ome of us.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<P>THE opinion which I gave with re&s;pect to the power of the judges of the court, in calling out the po&s;&s;e, may be que&s;|tioned; and from thence it may be inferred, that I was favour|able to the de&s;igns of the rioters. This would be unfair, as at the &s;ame time, it was part of my opinion that, with the &s;her|iff, they had power; and the &s;heriff was at hand, who inde|pendent of his official character, was known to be a man of great per&s;onal intrepidity, and of a &s;olid and exten&s;ive popu|lar influence.</P>
<P>But though, on a rapid con&s;ideration of the que&s;tion, I may have been mi&s;taken with regard to the power of the judges independent of the &s;heriff, yet on examination, it will be found, there is &s;uch ground in the que&s;tion as might lead to a mi&s;take.</P>
<P>By the con&s;titution, the judges have no more power "as to criminal matters," than a ju&s;tice of the peace. The que&s;tion then will be, Has a ju&s;tice of the peace, power to rai&s;e the po&s;&s;e?</P>
<P>The office of ju&s;tice of the peace was not known to the com|mon law. It was fir&s;t in&s;tituted by 1. Edward 3. chap. 16. with power under the general term, "a&s;&s;igned to keep the peace."</P>
<P>By 4. Edward 3. chap. 2. Farther power is given.</P>
<P>By 18. Edward 3. chap. 2. Still farther power.</P>
<P>By 34. Edward 3. chap. 1. Power is given, which, <HI>by im|plication,</HI> may &s;eem to authori&s;e to rai&s;e the po&s;&s;e.</P>
<P>By 17. Richard 2. chap. 10. The power is thought to be expre&s;sly given under the term "<HI>mini&s;ters,</HI>" which may in|clude a ju&s;tice of the peace.</P>
<P>13. Henry 4. chap. 7. is the la&s;t &s;tatute that re&s;pects the power of the ju&s;tices in rai&s;ing the po&s;&s;e.&mdash;It is in the&s;e words:
<Q>If any riot, a&s;&s;embly, or rout of people again&s;t the law, be made in parties of the realm, the ju&s;tices of peace, three, or two of them at the lea&s;t, and the &s;heriff, or un|der &s;heriff of the county, where &s;uch riot, a&s;&s;embly or rout &s;hall be made hereafter, &s;hall come <HI>with the power of the county,</HI> if need be to arre&s;t, and &s;hall arre&s;t them; and the &s;ame ju&s;tices, and &s;heriff, or under &s;heriff, &s;hall have pow|er to record that which they &s;hall find &s;o done in their pre|&s;ence
<PB N="13" REF="028332_0010_0FD899BD452C1CA8">
again&s;t the law, and that by the record of the &s;ame ju&s;tices and &s;heriff, or under &s;heriff, &s;uch tre&s;pa&s;&s;ers, and offenders, &s;hall be convict in the manner and form as is con|tained in the &s;tatutes of forcible entries.</Q></P>
<P>Whether the power of ju&s;tices, without the &s;heriff, or un|der &s;heriff, to rai&s;e the po&s;&s;e, is taken away by this &s;tatute, is the que&s;tion. There would &s;eem rea&s;on in not leaving it to a &s;ingle ju&s;tice of the peace, to alarm and rai&s;e the county at his di&s;cretion, on information of an affray, at a di&s;tance. And yet it may be &s;aid, and probably is the ju&s;t con&s;truction of the &s;tatute, that the power of the ju&s;tices is not re&s;trained in rai&s;|ing the po&s;&s;e, but enlarged to a farther act, which two, or more with the &s;heriff, or under &s;heriff, may exerci&s;e; that is, make a record of the riot, which &s;hall have the force of an inqui&s;ition by a jury, or a pre&s;entment, or indictment at the court.</P>
<P>Be this as it may, in the opinion I gave judge Wilkins, I certainly pointed to the &s;afe&s;t, and mo&s;t effectual means, which was, that of proceeding with the &s;heriff.</P>
<P>The &s;heriff is him&s;elf, by the common law, the great con|&s;ervator of the peace of his county. He may

<P>But it may be &s;aid, that the opinion which I gave that an at|tempt to rai&s;e the po&s;&s;e was not expedient, indicated a di&s;po&s;ition favourable to the views of the rioters. Let it be ob&s;erved, that I gave no opinion, in the ca&s;e, until the que&s;tion was put to me. I had confined my&s;elf &s;trictly to the legal points pro|po&s;ed. Al&s;o before my opinion was given, the &s;heriff had de|clared his opinion. It appears al&s;o that before our conference,
<PB N="14" REF="028332_0011_0FD899BECF9902F0">
judge Gib&s;on&punc; and judge Wilkins had declared the &s;ame opin|ion <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The te&s;timony of Neville the younger, in the ca&s;e of the United States v. Miller.</NOTE>. At all events they in&s;tantly concurred with me. I did not at all wonder that Neville the younger, or any other of the immediate connections, &s;hould have been &s;anguine with re|gard to the practicability of rai&s;ing the po&s;&s;e. The pa&s;&s;ion which they felt, promoted them to overlook the difficulty; and whether practicable or not to any great extent, it was natural for them to wi&s;h the attempt made. It would give them company; it would make tho&s;e equally obnoxious who did attempt it; or at lea&s;t who did obey; and wounded pride and &s;elf-love was not ready to indulge a proper concern for the &s;afety of others; or make a proper calculation of the effect, which a concern for his own &s;afety, in the then temper of the country, mu&s;t leave upon every mind. Be&s;ides, they could not know, &s;o well as others, the general rage of the cou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ry, again&s;t the exci&s;e law, and its officers. Some things that regard them&s;elves, will always be concealed from men; and per&s;ons may appear moderate in their tran&s;actions with them who have the mo&s;t ho&s;tile &s;enti|ments. They did not even know the di&s;po&s;ition of the town of Pitt&s;burgh; I &s;peak of the affections of the people per&s;onally towards them. They counted more upon the attachment of the people, as is natural for men, than could be depended on.</P>
<P>But the fact was, had th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y been the greate&s;t favourites, the people would not have be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> commanded, in a cau&s;e of that nature. From the country they could not. A &s;entiment of oppo&s;ition to the law was univer&s;al; and though force had been heretofore u&s;ed with &s;ome concealment, yet it was thought laudable to u&s;e it; and the example being &s;et of u&s;ing it open|ly, the general bent would be to follow.</P>
<P>From the town, the people could not have been commanded. Many of them had connections in the country, and would not &s;ubmit to an order of taking arms <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">gain&s;t them. Be&s;ides, they had, them&s;elves, a good deal of the &s;ame &s;pirit of oppo&s;ition to the law; not &s;o much from any con&s;ideration of the law, or its effects, but be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">u&s;e it was the patriotic and fa&s;hionable language. Others, as is natural, wi&s;hed for &s;omething new; and would rather have joined them, than fought again&s;t them. It is a fact, that &s;ome influential men, and commi&s;&s;ioned in the militia, were heard to &s;ay that day, that if they were ordered out, and were to fight at all, it would be with the people. Thus,
<PB N="15" REF="028332_0012_0FD8858D2A3CD208">
the cau&s;e of the people, and that of the government, were thought to be very different things.</P>
<P>But, with the be&s;t di&s;po&s;ition in the town of Pitt&s;burgh, a concern for their general intere&s;t, as mechanics, or &s;hopkeepers, would render them reluctant to enter into a conte&s;t with the country, from whence a great part of their cu&s;tom came: And a concern for their immediate &s;afety, would prevent them alto|gether. They would reflect, the mo&s;t ignorant of them, that the militia of the town, about 250 men, were they unanimous, and &s;pirited in &s;upport of government, would be nothing to the country; which would, in the next in&s;tance, after an attack on the exci&s;e officer, turn it&s;elf again&s;t the town. It could &s;tarve them out, and the garri&s;on with them, by an interdict of pro|vi&s;ions; or, as was threatened afterwards, it could plunder and burn. It would have been extreme cruelty, to force the in|habitants to this danger. It would have been extreme impo|licy; and would have an&s;wered no other end, than to &s;hew the rioters the &s;trength they had even in the town, either from tho&s;e who really were, or from &s;elf-pre&s;ervation would affect to be, with them. It was &s;afe&s;t to let the matter re&s;t unknown. Per&s;ua&s;ion, for the moment, and the &s;teady, and accu&s;tomed &s;tep of civil authority, by the known officers, afterward, were the only means that were eligible. The rai&s;ing the po&s;&s;e of the county, as a legal act, was a thing unknown to the people, and would not be under&s;tood. It would be con&s;idered as the party of the exci&s;e officer, di&s;po&s;ed to try their &s;trength with the friends of liberty. It would have been a mo&s;t ra&s;h act. I will trace what would have been the con&s;equence.&mdash;The po&s;&s;e could have been rai&s;ed, or it could not. If it could not have been rai&s;ed, the weakne&s;s of the government, and the &s;trength of the rioters, was di&s;covered by the experiment. If it could have been rai&s;ed, and brought forward, a conte&s;t would have taken place, and lives have been lo&s;t. The victory mu&s;t have been on the &s;ide of the rioters; for the &s;trength of the country was with them. The plundering, and de&s;truction of the town of Pitt&s;burgh, would have en&s;ued. The garri&s;on would have been &s;tarved out, or taken; for there was not, at that time, more than a day's provi&s;ion in it. The whole country would have been involved in&s;tantly. De&s;peration would have led to prompt, and deci&s;ive mea&s;ures. The&s;e would be, to cro&s;s the mountains, and receive acce&s;&s;ion of force, and procure the means, and occupy the ground of war in the midland country. On the circum&s;tances that afterwards took place, it was what I was
<PB N="16" REF="028332_0013_0FD899C03178AC40">
afraid they would do; as will be &s;een by and by, when I come to explain a letter that I wrote to the government.</P>
<P>But in order to rebut &s;till farther the pre&s;umption, that I gave my opinion again&s;t rai&s;ing the po&s;&s;e, from motives favour|able to the rioters, let it be ob&s;erved, that if the po&s;&s;e had been rai&s;ed, I &s;hould have pa&s;&s;ed unnoticed in the croud, and could have excu&s;ed my&s;elf, by alledging the compul&s;ion of the law; but, in taking upon me to interfere in &s;o o&s;ten&s;ible a manner, as I was di&s;po&s;ed to do, in addre&s;&s;ing them on the unlawful, and atrocious act which they were about to perpetrate, I &s;hew|ed a readine&s;s to &s;acrifice popular favour for the public good. And that I would &s;acrifice whatever I did po&s;&s;e&s;s of it, if I did po&s;&s;e&s;s any, I knew to be the con&s;equence; and expre&s;sly men|tioned this view of the re&s;ult as to my&s;elf, to the company as we rode. I had ju&s;t before &s;uffered my name to be introduc|ed, or if any one would chu&s;e to have it &s;o, had managed to have it introduced, as a candidate, for the Congre&s;s of the United States, for the di&s;trict of Wa&s;hington and Allegheny counties; and my pride was now engaged, to carry my elec|tion. Was it the way to carry it, to oppo&s;e my&s;elf to a &s;trong popular pa&s;&s;ion, and ob&s;truct the accompli&s;hment of a favourite object? It may be &s;aid, I would have obtained credit after|wards with the people them&s;elves, for preventing what on co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> reflection they would &s;ee would have been dangerous. With &s;ome I might have obtained credit, but with the far greater part, I would not. Even tho&s;e that approved it, would affect to condemn it, and leave me to bear the odium. If at a future day, I might have obtained general credit, which probably would have been the ca&s;e, it would have been too late to &s;erve me in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> object at that time.</P>
<P>But if any one &s;hould &s;till in&s;i&s;t, that the experiment ought to have been made, and that the probability is, that the po&s;&s;e could have been rai&s;ed, I will give them a farther pre&s;umption to the contrary. The Neville family is numerous, and wealthy: The in&s;pector him&s;elf, with the advantage of an office, which though it brings general odium, yet &s;ecures particular depend|ents: His &s;on a member of A&s;&s;embly, brigade in&s;pector, and &s;urveyor of the county: His &s;on-in-law, I&s;aac Craig, deputy quarter ma&s;ter, with the care of the military &s;tores, and the con&s;tructing public buildings, and the employment of mechanics which this gives: His brother-in-law, Abraham Kirkpatrick, with money, and means of a&s;&s;i&s;ting his neighbours.

<P>GREAT pains were taken, at Couche's fort, by an aged and venerable clergymen, the reverend John Clark, to di&s;&s;uade the people from the object they had in view. It was to no purpo&s;e. They con&s;idered him as in his dotage; or as having &s;kill in &s;piritual affairs; but not in the temp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ral intere&s;ts of the country. It may be thought from hence, that di&s;&s;ua&s;ion from no one, could have had effect. That does not follow. Regard might have been paid to the repre&s;entations of tho&s;e who were &s;uppo&s;ed to know the law, and to be able to calculate the pro|bable con&s;equences of the act.</P>
<P>A certain James Lang, of Brown&s;ville, formerly of Phila|delphia, was on his way to Pitt&s;burgh, and halted &s;ome time, and conver&s;ed with M'Farlane, and u&s;ed much endeavour to di&s;&s;uade him from the act. M'Farlane fairly owned, that, on reflection, he had become &s;en&s;ible of the ra&s;hne&s;s of it; but that they had gone too far to retreat. That was, I pre&s;ume, he could not find a rea&s;onable pretence of receding; and could not, with a good grace, draw off, after having u&s;ed activity in exciting the people.</P>
<P>If this was the ca&s;e, it will prove the u&s;e of our having gone forward to di&s;&s;uade. It would afforded a rea&s;onable pretence of relinqui&s;hing the enterpri&s;e: The leaders, that is, tho&s;e who had been mo&s;t active in collecting the multitude, would &s;ay, that a light had been thrown upon the matter, by a lawyer, and judges, which had not before &s;truck them; and that, all things con&s;idered, it might be advi&s;eable to relinqui&s;h it. They would not have been a&s;hamed to have it thought, that they were bet|ter informed, by men of greater opportunities of legal know|ledge; and e&s;pecially by one who&s;e profe&s;&s;ion was the law it&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="028332_0015_0FD899C637779D90">M'Farlane had been in Pitt&s;burgh that day, and purcha&s;ed a quantity of flints. He informed the people in the rendezvous, that they might count upon a force from the town of Pitt&s;|burgh; that the &s;heriff was &s;ent for to rai&s;e the po&s;&s;e; and that &s;oldiers had gone out from the garri&s;on to Neville's hou&s;e. This information &s;eemed to animate: They had no idea of an oppo|&s;ition that could be formidable.</P>
<P>In arranging the mea&s;ures of the enterpri&s;e, a committee was appointed; with power like that of the national commi&s;&s;ioners with the French armies. This committee offered the command to a Benjamin Parki&s;on; who excu&s;ed him&s;elf, as not being a man of military knowledge. James M'Farlane was then nomi|nated, and accepted it. This was a major M'Farlane of the militia, who had &s;erved with reputation, in the rank of a lieu|tenant, in the war with Great Britain, from the beginning to the end of it; and was a man of good private character; and had acquired a very hand&s;ome property, by indu&s;try in trade, after the expiration of the war.</P>
<P>The body having marched, and approached the hou&s;e of the in&s;pector, the hor&s;es were left with a guard; and arrangements made for an attack, &s;hould it be nece&s;&s;ary. A flag was &s;ent from the committee, with a demand of the in&s;pector to deliver up his papers. This appears to have been the ultimate object of the rioters. The in&s;pector had withdrawn from the hou&s;e; having &s;een the force that was advancing: conceiving, I pre&s;ume, that a demand might be made of his per&s;on; and that, in con&s;e|quence of the encounter of the preceding morning, and the lo&s;s &s;u&s;tained by the a&s;&s;ailants, his life would be in danger. In this ca&s;e, he mu&s;t have counted on the not being able to defend the hou&s;e. Why then not have given direction to tho&s;e whom he left in the hou&s;e, not to attempt a defence? Perhaps he did it; but his brother-in-law, Kirkpatrick, a major in the &s;ervice la&s;t war, judging le&s;s prudently, entertained the idea of being able to defend it.</P>
<P>It being communicated, on the return of the flag, that the in&s;pector had left the hou&s;e, a &s;econd flag was &s;ent, and a de|mand made, that &s;ix per&s;ons &s;hould be admitted into the hou&s;e, to &s;earch for his papers, and take them. This was refu&s;ed; and notice was then given, by a third flag, for the lady of the in&s;pector, and any other female part of the family to withdraw. They did withdraw; and the attack commenced. About fifteen minutes after the commencement, a flag was pre&s;ented, or was thought to be pre&s;ented, from the hou&s;e; upon which, M'Far|lane

&s;tepping from a tree, behind which he &s;tood, and com|manding a ce&s;&s;ation of the firing, received a ball in the in&s;ide of his thigh, near the groin, and in&s;tantly expired. The firing then continued; and a me&s;&s;age was &s;ent to the committee, who were &s;itting at &s;ome di&s;tance, to know whether the hou&s;e &s;hould not be &s;tormed: But, in the mean time, fire had been &s;et to a barn, and to other buildings adjoining the man&s;ion hou&s;e; and in a &s;hort time, the inten&s;ene&s;s of the heat, and the evident communicability of the flame to the hou&s;e, had &s;truck tho&s;e in the hou&s;e, with a &s;en&s;e of immediate danger of life; and they began to call for quarter: on which the firing cea&s;ed, and they were de&s;ired to come out, and &s;urrender them&s;elves. They came out; and the &s;oldiers, three of whom are &s;aid to have been wounded, were &s;uffered to pa&s;s by, and go where they thought proper. Major Kirkpatrick him&s;elf, had nearly pa&s;&s;ed through, when he was di&s;tingui&s;hed from the &s;oldiers, and ar|re&s;ted; and ordered to deliver his mu&s;ket. This he refu&s;ed; when one pre&s;enting a gun to his brea&s;t, was about to fire; he dropped upon his knee, and a&s;ked quarter. The man took the major's hat from his head, and put it on the muzzle of his gun; but did him no other damage.&mdash;I depict the&s;e incidents, merely to give an intimate idea of the manners and &s;pirit of the people.</P>
<P>Fire had been put to an end of the man&s;ion hou&s;e, before the fire communicated from the barn and other buildings. All were con&s;umed; one &s;mall building excepted; to which fire was not put, but a guard &s;et over it, at the &s;ugge&s;tion of the negroes, that it contained their bacon.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the hou&s;e was on fire, the undi&s;ciplined of the troops, if I may be allowed the expre&s;&s;ion; or, as they them|&s;elves would &s;ay, the unprincipled among&s;t them, entered, and began to plunder. The cellar was broke open, and wine and other liquors rolled out, and drank.</P>
<P>Major Kirkpatrick, after being carried &s;ome di&s;tance under guard, was taken up by David Hamilton, behind him on hor&s;e-back; when, thinking him&s;elf protected, he began to an&s;wer tho&s;e who came up occa&s;ionally, with indignant language: when Hamilton, addre&s;&s;ing him, &s;aid, You &s;ee I am endeavouring to &s;ave you, at the ri&s;k of my own &s;afety; and yet you are acting a part, that makes it &s;till more dangerous for me. On this he was &s;ilent; and being carried &s;ome di&s;tance farther by Hamil|ton, and getting into the bu&s;hes of the wood, he was advi&s;ed to make his e&s;cape; and he effected it.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="028332_0017_0FD899CE47C25BD0">Neville the younger, mar&s;hal Lenox, and the young man of the name of Orm&s;by, had arrived at the outguard, about the time the firing had begun at the hou&s;e. They were arre&s;ted, and put under guard. Neville &s;olicited greatly to go forward; and would engage, that every demand, &s;hort of life, &s;hould be complied with. In the then &s;tate of things, he could not be permitted. In a &s;hort time, he had the pain to &s;ee the build|ings on fire; and to be uncertain of the fate of his father and family; whether they were in the hou&s;e, or out of it.</P>
<P>On the termination of the bu&s;ine&s;s, and the return of the people from the hou&s;e, Neville and the Mar&s;hal were carried along, and in great per&s;onal danger from the multitude, many of whom, by this time, had become intoxicated. Young Orm&s;|by being known to many of them, after being treated with &s;ome indignity, was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>The mar&s;hal al&s;o, after &s;ome time, having &s;tipulated to &s;erve no farther proce&s;s on the we&s;t of the mountains, and to &s;urrender him&s;elf when demanded; and Neville the younger having become &s;pon&s;or for the fidelity of this engagement, was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from the main body: Neville al&s;o went with him. They had in&s;i&s;ted on an engagement from the mar&s;hal that he would not return his proce&s;&s;es which had been &s;erved. He told them with candour, that this was not in his power, being under an oath of office to return them. The firmne&s;s of the mar&s;hal in having the candour to make this acknowledgment, even though at the manife&s;t ri&s;k of life, de&s;erves great commendation. It won it, and had it from them, as &s;ome of them have acknow|ledged to me. I have heard all &s;peak, with great admiration of the manly, and compo&s;ed behaviour of the mar&s;hal: No|thing again&s;t Neville; but that he exhibited a little too much of the chevalier at the fir&s;t. Coming up to the out-guard on his fir&s;t advance, "If there is a gentleman among&s;t you," &s;aid he, "let him come out and &s;peak to me." This was con&s;id|ered as an affront to the whole; and &s;everal rai&s;ed their piec|es, and were di&s;po&s;ed to fire. But with pre&s;ence of mind, changing his voice to greater &s;oftne&s;s, and calling out that he was not armed, they advanced, and made him pri&s;oner. His pi&s;tols had not been drawn from the hol&s;ters, and therefore he might &s;ay, he was not armed.</P>
<P>After being di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from the body, they fell in with an out party, the greater part, greatly intoxicated. The mar&s;hal, taken afre&s;h by the&s;e, was carried towards Couche's fort, to which they were returning. He was in danger of life. The
<PB N="21" REF="028332_0018_0FD899CF32A68998">
re&s;ult mu&s;t have appeared to him on this occa&s;ion very doubt|ful. He was for &s;ome time under the care of a James M'Allis|ter, who had re&s;cued him from great danger, but given his word to the more violent, not to &s;uffer him to e&s;cape. M'Allister, who had every di&s;po&s;ition to &s;ave him, did not to dare to let him go. After &s;ome time, he &s;urrendered him to a Colonel David Philips, who advancing &s;ome di&s;tance before the croud, with the mar&s;hal, was intreated by the mar&s;hal to be &s;uffer|ed to e&s;cape. Philips told him that his own life would an&s;wer for it. However he was at la&s;t prevailed upon, ju&s;t as they approached the main body who had advanced to Couche's fort, with the corp&s;e of M'Farlane, to &s;hew him a road in a certain direction, and &s;uffer him to e&s;cape. He got into the main road towards Pitt&s;burgh, and about 2 o'clock that morning came to the town.</P>
<P>There is one thing that may have &s;truck the reader: Why it was, that the judges, the &s;heriff and my&s;elf, when within a mile or two of Neville's hou&s;e, the evening it was burned, knowing the mar&s;hal to have gone forward, we did not, on his account at lea&s;t, as being a &s;tranger to the people, and hav|ing no per&s;onal friends, which the Nevilles, notwith&s;tanding this outrage on their property, certainly had, we did not go forward al&s;o, to u&s;e our influence to &s;ave him from injury. I had a perfect &s;en&s;e of his danger from the moment that I &s;aw him on hor&s;e-back to go out that day; and on the occa&s;ion to which the query refers, I could not be le&s;s apprehen&s;ive than I had been. As circum&s;tances then were, it was a different ca&s;e, from what it was when we &s;et out to Couche's fort, and when the idea would be, that we were not intere&s;ting our&s;elves, for an officer, or for government, but for the &s;afety of the people them&s;elves, in giving them good advice. Yet I would have ventured to have gone forward, provided two gentlemen of the company would remain; the&s;e were judge Gib&s;on, and judge Wilkins, both of whom I knew to be, at that juncture, obnoxious; judge Wilkins e&s;pecially.</P>

He had been before that time the mo&s;t popular man in Alleghe|ny county: but the &s;ingle circum&s;tance of the adverti&s;ement had reduced him to that &s;ituation in the opinion of the people, that I thought it nece&s;&s;ary to u&s;e &s;ome delicacy in pre&s;enting my&s;elf with him.</P>
<P>We deliberated &s;ome time, whether we &s;hould go on to Ne|ville's hou&s;e. I mentioned to &s;heriff Gralt expre&s;sly, my ap|prehen&s;ions with regard to Gib&s;on and Wilkins; and hinted it to the gentlemen them&s;elves, with as much delicacy as po&s;&s;ible; and expre&s;&s;ed a willingne&s;s to go forward my&s;elf, to bring in|telligence, if they would remain where they were. Judge Wilkins appeared to me to under&s;tand his &s;ituation perfectly; but though not thinking it &s;afe to go forward him&s;elf, yet did not like the idea of any el&s;e going, and him&s;elf not to go. This was not expre&s;sly &s;aid, yet I could &s;ufficiently di&s;cover it; and I knew it was a delicate conflict between his &s;afety and his ho|nour. It was the general opinion, that all &s;hould go, or none. This put an end to all thought of any going.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;entiments of my mind, at the time, with regard to judge Gib&s;on and judge Wilkins, have never been fully com|municated to tho&s;e gentlemen to this hour, and perhaps they have never under&s;tood them perfectly; but this &s;ituation in which they were with regard to the people, will &s;hew the ab|&s;urdity of &s;uppo&s;ing, that they could have called out the po&s;&s;e comitatus. The attempt would have been the &s;ignal of their own immediate de&s;truction. They would not have lived on the we&s;t of the mountains twenty-four hours.</P>
<P>The particulars I have &s;tated, with regard to the attack up|on the hou&s;e, the treatment of the mar&s;hal, and Neville, &amp;c. it will be under&s;tood, are as I have collected them; and they may not be perfectly correct. I can an&s;wer with more con|fidence for the exactne&s;s of particulars where I was my&s;elf pre&s;ent.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV.</HEAD>
<P>THE day after, in the evening, a David Hamilton, a ju&s;tice of the peace, and John Black, came to Pitt&s;burgh; with au|thority, in writing, to demand of the mar&s;hal, a &s;urrender of his writs which had been &s;erved; agreeably to his engagement, as they &s;aid, for which Neville the younger had become &s;pon|&s;or. A conference with the mar&s;hal, and with Neville, took place. It was denied, on the part of the mar&s;hal and Neville, that the engagement was, to deliver, or even not to return the writs; but only to make no farther &s;ervice. It was under|&s;tood otherwi&s;e on the part of Hamilton; who thought it but of &s;mall account to make no farther &s;ervice, as it could be of no u&s;e to tho&s;e on whom the proce&s;s had been &s;erved. This led to the que&s;tion, Whether the mar&s;hal was bound to return; and what would be the effect of the return? <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ether judgment could be taken, which would bind the lands here; &s;o that they could be &s;old in Philadelphia?</P>
<P>The mar&s;hal conceived it, from what he had under&s;tood, to be but an initiatory proce&s;s; and that judgment could not be taken; that there mu&s;t be another writ, and &s;ervice of it, in order to found a judgment: He referred them to my opinion, which he conceived mu&s;t be to that effect. John Black waited upon me; &s;ta|ting his que&s;tion, and explaining the circum&s;tances which led to his putting it. I felt all the delicacy of having any conver&s;ation with per&s;ons, who I conceived had involved them&s;elves in the guilt of high trea&s;on; much le&s;s, of giving any coun&s;el on a col|lateral que&s;tion. I an&s;wered him, by &s;aying, it was a delicate point, and I would talk with the mar&s;hal. I went out, and found the mar&s;hal, and &s;tated to him the circum&s;tance; and wi&s;hed to know his wi&s;h, whether I &s;hould con&s;ider the ca&s;e, and give an opinion. He &s;aid he would &s;peak with Neville. A &s;hort time afterwards, he came to me, with Neville, (I &s;peak of Neville the younger), and expre&s;&s;ed his willingne&s;s that I &s;hould give an o|pinion; that he thought it mu&s;t be as he had &s;tated, viz. that it was but an initiatory proce&s;s, and that judgment could not go by default, upon it. Declaring my&s;elf unacquainted with the practice of the federal court, though admitted in it; and that I could form my opinion only by analogy, and from the
<PB N="24" REF="028332_0021_0FD899D901A1E090">
face of the writ it&s;elf, I undertook the con&s;ideration of the que&s;tion that evening, and propo&s;ed giving an an&s;wer in the morning. With a view to this, the mar&s;hal furni&s;hed me with one of his writs; the only one, I under&s;tood, which had not been &s;erved. Neville the younger, furni&s;hed me with a copy of the laws of the United States; my own being, at that time, out of my office. I &s;tate the&s;e things minutely, to &s;hew, that no pre&s;umption exi&s;ts, in the circum&s;tance of having been con|&s;ulted by the&s;e people, or in giving an opinion in this ca&s;e, that I was in confidence, in any of their tran&s;actions.</P>
<P>Con&s;ulting the judiciary laws of the United States, I found nothing relative to the practice of the courts, or the nature of the proce&s;s. Nor did I much expect it; as this can be devi&s;ed and regulated by the courts them&s;elves. I found nothing in the revenue law it&s;elf; and was left to a con&s;ideration of the writ from the words of it, and the analogy to the practice of other courts. It appeared to me, as the mar&s;hal had conceived, to be but in the nature of a &s;ummons, to &s;hew cau&s;e why proce&s;s &s;hould not i&s;&s;ue. I pre&s;ume, it had been devi&s;ed by the court, for the greater mildne&s;s in carrying into operation the exci&s;e law. It was analagous to the &s;ubpoena from the court of chan|cery; in di&s;obedience of which an attachment i&s;&s;ues. My an|&s;wer therefore, which I gave in writing, and which I gave to &s;erve the mar&s;hal, for it was without &s;ee from any one, was to this effect, viz. That the mar&s;hal was on oath to make re|turn of his writs; but that judgment could not be taken on the&s;e returns, which would be final, and bind their lands in this country, or &s;ound proceedings to a &s;ale. Of this opinion, I made out two copies; and gave one to Hamilton and Black, and one to the mar&s;hal.</P>
<P>Hamilton was apprehen&s;ive that this would not &s;atisfy the committee: that if the people had known the mar&s;hal was bound to return his writs, he doubted much if he ever would have got off the ground. I communicated this to the mar&s;hal; and he appeared, as there was rea&s;on, much &s;truck with it&punc; He &s;aw the impo&s;&s;ibility of &s;atisfying the&s;e people, and the difficul|ty of getting out of the country, &s;hould he attempt to go with|out their con&s;ent: It would be leaving Neville the younger al|&s;o, in a di&s;agreeable &s;ituation, who had become &s;urety, that he would not go away, until the people were &s;atisfied as to the ful|filment of what he had engaged.</P>
<P>I have &s;ince a&s;certained it, as I have &s;tated in my narrative, that the mar&s;hal expre&s;sly refu&s;ed to engage not to return his
<PB N="25" REF="028332_0022_0FD8858EA7218C30">
writs: but it had been under&s;tood otherwi&s;e; or, on reflection, they had &s;een, that this was the principal matter, and they were determined to in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;t upon it.</P>
<P>I made the mar&s;hal's ca&s;e my own, with as much &s;en&s;ibility as the human heart could feel: and devi&s;ing an expedient to re|lieve him, communicated it to him; viz. That I would propo&s;e going forward to the committee, and offer to appear for them in the federal court, as coun&s;el, and have the writs qua&s;hed, or the &s;ervice &s;et a&s;ide; or if I did not accompli&s;h this, pay the penalties my&s;elf: that I knew the court, under the&s;e circum|&s;tances, would not exact the penalties. But, that it would not be nece&s;&s;ary to make this offer, but in the la&s;t re&s;ort. The mar&s;hal thought &s;o.</P>
<P>I had under&s;tood, that the committee were then &s;itting, at the di&s;tance of four miles, at the public hou&s;e that has been mentioned; Shochan's. The idea of a number of men being there, had been held out by Hamilton and Black, for their own &s;afety in the town. Being now about to return, they men|tioned the going by the battle ground, as they called it; that is, by the late hou&s;e of the in&s;pector; in order to look for the body of a man that was mi&s;&s;ing, and &s;uppo&s;ed to be killed; and they expre&s;&s;ed a wi&s;h, that I, and &s;ome others of the in|habitants, would go with them. I &s;aw they were under &s;ome apprehen&s;ions for their &s;afety, in going by them&s;elves; either from tho&s;e who might way-lay them on the road, or from the negroes on the farm. The la&s;t only was &s;ugge&s;ted. I con|&s;ented to go, provided &s;ome others could be got to go; and more e&s;pecially, as in that ca&s;e, I would go on to the commit|tee, which would be in my way, on another road, on my re|turn&punc; I mentioned this to the mar&s;hal, who approved of it: To Neville al&s;o, if I recollect right. I had under&s;tood, that &s;everal gentlemen propo&s;ed to go: I was ready on the Monon|gahela bank, at the ferry, at the time propo&s;ed. Hamilton and Black were there. Two of the gentlemen came down, and mentioned, that they had not found it convenient to go. I &s;aw a delicacy on their part; and this made my going the more de|licate. I had determined not to go. But at that in&s;tant, a Mr. John&s;tone, a deputy exci&s;e officer, came up, who wi&s;hed to go to his re&s;idence, at the hou&s;e of Neville the younger, ju&s;t by the late re&s;idence of the in&s;pector. He had been a tenant, for &s;ome time, to Neville the younger. I thought I might go, at lea&s;t that di&s;tance, having him with me: and I &s;poke to Hamil|ton and Black, to wait until he could get his hor&s;e, and go.
<PB N="26" REF="028332_0023_0FD899DA94D86918">
We waited a long time, and then propo&s;ed to cro&s;s the river, and wait for him on the other &s;ide. We did &s;o; and cro&s;&s;ing after us, he joined us there.</P>
<P>In the cour&s;e of our conver&s;ation on the way, I under&s;tood from Hamilton, that, agreeably to his orders from the commit|tee, he had been with the in&s;pector, and demanded of him a re&s;ignation of his office; that Neville the younger had wi&s;hed him to re&s;ign, and that the in&s;pector him&s;elf had agreed to re|&s;ign it, and had written &s;omething to that effect, which he had offered to them, to carry to the committee; but that it was conditional and not ab&s;olute, and they could not accept it: that they thought it probable the con&s;equence would be bad, and there would be no re&s;training the people from coming into Pitt&s;burgh, to take him; that he was apprehen&s;ive al&s;o, they would come in to demand the mar&s;hal, and at lea&s;t detain him pri&s;oner, &s;o that he could not be able to return his writs. I meditated on the &s;trange incon&s;i&s;tency, of &s;etting the govern|ment at defiance, and yet fearing the return of the writs.</P>
<P>I under&s;tood al&s;o, from Hamilton, that the return of the mar&s;hal him&s;elf, without the con&s;ent of the people, was imprac|ticable; as there was not a &s;ingle road from the country, which was not that day guarded, for the expre&s;s purpo&s;e of prevent|ing him. Hamilton, at the &s;ame time, expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf with humanity, for the mar&s;hal; and &s;aid, that it was to prevent mi&s;chief, that he had propo&s;ed coming into Pitt&s;burgh: For, that the people a&s;&s;embled at the interment of M'Farlane were in a rage, and had propo&s;ed marching into Pitt&s;burgh, to take the in&s;pector and the mar&s;hal; that it was the language of the people, with regard to the mar&s;hal, that it was better one man &s;hould die, than &s;o many per&s;ons, with their families, lo&s;e their plantations. He al&s;o gave me to under&s;tand, that there would not be, that day, a &s;ingle office &s;tanding in the whole &s;urvey. I conceived from this, that mea&s;ures of an exten&s;ive nature had been taken.</P>
<P>On the way, I under&s;tood that, in fact, there was no com|mittee &s;itting nearer than at the di&s;tance of 14 miles, near the place of the interment of M'Farlane.</P>
<P>Arriving at a hou&s;e where the family of the deputy exci&s;e officer had retired, and near the late hou&s;e of the in&s;pector, we &s;topped; and the deputy making out his re&s;ignation, delivered it, to be carried to the committee. He wi&s;hed Hamilton to give him a certificate, that he might be &s;afe. Hamilton &s;aid he had no authority to do this; he could only bear his re&s;ignation: But
<PB N="27" REF="028332_0024_0FD899DFE2B062E8">
that he thought he would be &s;afe, provided he publi&s;hed a copy of his re&s;ignation in the Pitt&s;burgh Gazette. The deputy &s;aid he would do it: and I &s;ubjoin it, in a note, as it was, and as it appeared in the gazette <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Finding the oppo&s;ition to the revenue law, more violent than I expect|ed; regretting the mi&s;chief that has been done, and may, from the continu|ation of mea&s;ures; &s;eeing the oppo&s;ition changed from di&s;gui&s;ed rabble to a re&s;pectable party; think it my duty, and do re&s;ign my commi&s;&s;ion.
<BIBL>ROBERT JOHNSTON.</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P>We went, the deputy accompanying us, to the late hou&s;e of the in&s;pector, and found the negroes in &s;ome cabbins adjoining, which the fire had not reached. It was out of the&s;e they had fired upon the fir&s;t party, under Holcroft. I under&s;tood al|&s;o, that notwith&s;tanding the attention of the negroes to &s;ecure the bacon, &s;ome of it had been carried off.</P>
<P>We rode over the adjacent ground, but found no dead body. It was found, a few days afterward, by the negroes; and bu|ried.</P>
<P>Having fini&s;hed our &s;urvey, I was urged by Hamilton and Black, to ride with them, at lea&s;t to a road which led to Pitt&s;|burgh, and was in their way: I excu&s;ed my&s;elf, and returned with the deputy. The deputy returned with me to the lower ferry, on the Monongahela, oppo&s;ite the town of Pitt&s;burgh. That being his ferry, and not mine, I rode on to a higher. A violent gu&s;t of wind and rain, &s;uch as I have &s;eldom &s;een, com|ing on, I remained in the ferry-hou&s;e, during the &s;torm. Cro&s;|&s;ing the river, and arriving at my hou&s;e, I was informed, that the mar&s;hal had been frequently there that day, enquiring with great &s;olicitude for my return. I would have called upon him in&s;tantly, but it was late; and a town-meeting, in the affair of a market hou&s;e, to which I was &s;ummoned, engaged my atten|tion. Neville the younger, and Craig the &s;on-in-law, and Kirk|patrick, were pre&s;ent, and joined in the deliberation. I had no idea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> that, in the mean time, and in the middle of the ter|rible tempe&s;t that had fallen, the in&s;pector and the mar&s;hal had embarked, and de&s;cended the river.</P>
<P>In my return from accompanying Hamilton and Black, I had projected in my mind, the plan of re&s;cuing the mar&s;hal. It was to acompany him in&s;tantly to the town of Wa&s;hington, and put him on the honour and good policy of the Democratic Society of that place. I had thought he would have been &s;afe there; as the idea of being guardians of the con&s;titutional principle,
<PB N="28" REF="028332_0025_0FD899E2B7872DF0">
would have led them to protect him. I thought of having him accompanied thence to Union-town, in Fayette county; and to have got general Dougla&s;s of that place, and other gen|tlemen, to have e&s;corted him to the Maryland or Virginia line, where he would have been out of danger; e&s;caping the Penn|&s;ylvania counties, in which he had &s;erved proce&s;s.</P>
<P>Early next morning, I went to the public hou&s;e where the mar&s;hal lodged, and enquired for him; was told he had lodged at the garri&s;on: enquired frequently in the cour&s;e of the fore|noon; but the rumour &s;preading, that he was gone, and the in&s;pector with him, the preceding evening, I found it was &s;o; but was led to believe, he had a&s;cended the Allegheny river. I had &s;uppo&s;ed, he had taken the cour&s;e by Fort Franklin, and the back parts of Penn&s;ylvania; and thought it a judicious cour&s;e. The cour&s;e that he did take was the be&s;t.</P>
<P>The que&s;tion has been a&s;ked, why it was the magi&s;trates did not i&s;&s;ue warrants, and arre&s;t Hamilton and Black, when they came to Pitt&s;burgh? They did not dare to do it: They were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ag officers from a great power. There was no per&s;on &s;o incon&s;iderate as to break a thought of it. After the burning of Neville's hou&s;e, the rumour was that another body was a&s;|&s;embling to come to Pitt&s;burgh, to demoli&s;h the in&s;pection hou&s;e kept there; and it was dreaded that they would proceed to other enormities. It was the cry of the inhabitants that ra|ther than provoke the country, and bring mad people upon us, it would be be&s;t to pull the office down. The evening that Hamilton and Black came to town, the report of two having come, had in half an hour &s;welled to two hundred; and it was &s;aid there was a thou&s;and on the hill, on the other &s;ide of the river. The people were gazing every where, and every one thought he &s;aw &s;ome, and that they had hunting &s;hirts. Application was made to Hamilton and Black in my pre&s;ence, &s;tating that the ladies, tho&s;e of the Neville fami|ly particularly, were unea&s;y, and reque&s;ting one of them to cro&s;s the river and a&s;certain the truth of the circum&s;tance. Black gravely an&s;wered, that there might be &s;ix or eight hun|dred on the hill, or not far off; but that he would cro&s;s over, and give orders to di&s;per&s;e: He cro&s;&s;ed the river, and came back with an account that there had been none there.</P>
<P>Craig, the &s;on-in-law of the in&s;pector, after the departure of the in&s;pector, had &s;o ju&s;t an apprehen&s;ion of danger from the country, that he took down the paper on the in&s;pection of|fice, and called a gentlemen to witne&s;s, that it was down.
<PB N="29" REF="028332_0026_0FD8859087E0BD28">
This gentleman was James Lang, of Brown&s;ville. He al&s;o of|fered the fragments of it to this gentleman, to bear to the country, to convince them that it was down. The&s;e circum|&s;tances &s;hew the ab&s;urdity of talking of arre&s;ting Hamilton and Black.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. V.</HEAD>
<P>ON Monday, the 21&s;t of July, being the fourth day after burning the hou&s;e of the in&s;pector, and the &s;econd after the departure of the mar&s;hal, in the afternoon of the day, a young man came to my office, and delivered me a note from David Hamilton, informing me, that the committee was to &s;it at the Mingo meeting-hou&s;e, on the Wedne&s;day following, and ex|pre&s;&s;ing a wi&s;h that I would be pre&s;ent. I conceived, that it was with a view to the object he under&s;tood me before to have, in propo&s;ing to go to the committee; viz. the explaining to the people the effect of the return of the writs, and inducing them to be &s;atisfied, and not to arre&s;t or detain the mar&s;hal. Never|thele&s;s, I was greatly alarmed, at the idea of having any cor|re&s;pondence with one involved in the guilt of trea&s;on. I tore the note, and threw it by in the lower part of a clo&s;et in my office, among&s;t u&s;ele&s;s papers, meaning never to make farther mention of it.</P>
<P>The next day, Neville the younger came to my office, and a&s;ked me, if I had not received a note from David Hamilton? I have, &s;aid I; but how have you come to the knowledge of it? The young man, &s;aid he, that brought it, mentioned it. I had never intended to have mentioned it, &s;aid I; but here it is; opening the clo&s;et, and taking up the pieces, and putting them together, and giving them to him to read. I wi&s;hed to have him as a witne&s;s of the contents. Do you mean to go&punc; &s;aid he. No, &s;aid I; this is high trea&s;on that has been com+mitted; and in trea&s;on there are no acce&s;&s;aries, before <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> after the fact, all are principals; and I am aware of the deli|cacy, of having any thing to &s;ay to people in the predicament in which the&s;e are. I have reflected on the &s;ubject, and think it not &s;afe to go. I would wi&s;h you to go, &s;aid he; it might an|&s;wer a good end. Connecting in my mind, his engagement on behalf of the mar&s;hal, who had gone, and his re&s;pon&s;ibility in that ca&s;e, I under&s;tood him, to wi&s;h me to go to reconcile the
<PB N="30" REF="028332_0027_0FD899E452A135F8">
people with the circum&s;tance, as far as might be; and al&s;o to coun&s;el moderation in general. Not a word pa&s;&s;ed with regard to my object in going; but I conceived it to be &s;ufficiently un|der&s;tood, what the object was. I was &s;till di&s;po&s;ed to decline it; but was &s;olicited; and finally &s;aid, I will go, provided you will vouch with what &s;entiments I go. I will, &s;aid he. And provided, &s;aid I, &s;ome per&s;on can be got to go with me, to bear te&s;timony of what I &s;hall &s;ay, or do, on the occa&s;ion. It was agreed, that I &s;hould &s;peak to &s;ome, and he &s;hould &s;peak to others. He did &s;peak to &s;ome, and I &s;poke to others. The per&s;ons that agreed to accompany me, were, the chief burge&s;s of the town, George Robin&s;on; the fir&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;tant burge&s;s, Jo|&s;iah Tannehill; one of the regulators of the town. William H. Beaumont; Peter Audrain, and colonel William Semple, for|merly of Philadelphia, merchants.</P>
<P>Setting out on the day, and arriving at the meeting, I was &s;truck, with finding, not a committee, as I had expected, of tho&s;e per&s;ons who had been concerned in burning the hou&s;e of the in&s;pector, but a large convention of others, with the&s;e, from a con&s;iderable di&s;tance. I conceived, that the&s;e per&s;ons had come with the view of coun&s;elling moderation, and devi&s;ing the be&s;t means of healing what had been done: Yet, from the delicacy of the &s;ituation, there was a di&s;tance and &s;ilence among&s;t all of us, as we reclined upon the gra&s;s, or &s;trolled about, prior to the a&s;&s;embling of the meeting. I was upon terms of intima|cy with many; and yet do not recollect to have exchanged a &s;in|gle word with a man. Every countenance di&s;covered a &s;trong &s;en&s;e of the &s;olemnity of that occa&s;ion: Tho&s;e who had been involved, not more than tho&s;e who were afraid to be involved. It will be a&s;ked me, How came any there who were afraid to be involved? I have accounted for my being there; but how came David Bradford James Mar&s;hall, Edward Cook, and Craig Richey there? I &s;elect the&s;e as in&s;tances. As to Mar&s;hall and Bradford, I am a lo&s;s to &s;ay any thing, by way of opinion, or deduction. I can only &s;tate what I have under&s;tood from others, or what <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s within my own knowledge. Not having had the lea&s;t commu|nication, by word or writing, with Mar&s;hall or Bradford, prior to that day, or on that day, relative to the &s;ubject, I have no|thing of my own knowledge. I have under&s;tood from others, that after the fir&s;t attack upon the hou&s;e of the in&s;pector, when the adjacent country was about to be rou&s;ed to a &s;econd attack, per&s;ons went to the town of Wa&s;hington, and called on Mar|&s;hall and Bradford to come forward, on that occa&s;ion. They
<PB N="31" REF="028332_0028_0FD899E5B39903D0">
declined it. The expre&s;&s;ion of Bradford, reported to me, is, "I cannot act; you may do as you think proper." He alluded, as was under&s;tood, to his being the pro&s;ecuting coun&s;el for the commonwealth; and, in that ca&s;e, not at liberty to do what o|thers might.</P>
<P>After the de&s;truction of the hou&s;e, per&s;ons went to Mar&s;hall and Bradford, demanding of them to come forward, and &s;up|port what was done, or they would burn their hou&s;es. They had a claim upon them, as having been con&s;picuous in the de|liberative committees, with regard to the exci&s;e law; and al|ledged, that Bradford had encouraged them to what they had done, by his words, when urged to take part before the burn|ing. I encourage, &s;aid he: Good God! I never thought of &s;uch a thing. Yes you did encourage, &s;aid they; and if you do not come forward now, and &s;upport us, you &s;hall be treated in the &s;ame, or a wor&s;e manner, with the exci&s;e officer. He found him&s;elf under the nece&s;&s;ity of coming forward; and that being the ca&s;e, he would &s;eem, from that time, to have adopted the mo&s;t violent coun&s;els. Mar&s;hall was obliged al&s;o to come forward; and thought it nece&s;&s;ary, having come forward, to adopt violent coun&s;els. I am of opinion, that both the&s;e men acted, in the fir&s;t in&s;tances, under a &s;ubordination to popular influence. Be this as it may, it is not from a &s;olicitude to make an apology for them, that I &s;tate this; but from the wi&s;h that I have to &s;hew the truth of the tran&s;actions. Edward Cook al&s;o came forward, probably, at the &s;olicitation, and under the fear of the people. Craig Richey, and many others, I know did. They had, with great difficulty, avoided the going to the burning the hou&s;e of Neville; but could not avoid, at lea&s;t the appearance of being with the people now. I have introduced the names of the&s;e per&s;ons, becau&s;e they were con&s;picuous at this meeting. It was opened, by putting Cook in the chair, and making Richey &s;ecretary.</P>
<P>A letter was produced, and read, from Neville the younger, which had been &s;ent by a gentlemen of our company, &s;tating, that his father and the mar&s;hal had left the country; that the mar&s;hal had not con&s;idered him&s;elf bound by that part of his engagement, which was to &s;urrender him&s;elf when demanded, and of which engagement he (Neville) had become &s;pon&s;or; becau&s;e, after the engagement made, and the mar&s;hal di&s;mi&s;&s;ed upon it, he had been again arre&s;ted, and was indebted to him|&s;elf for his e&s;cape. I did not think Neville had been &s;o good a
<PB N="32" REF="028332_0029_0FD899E853171D90">
ca&s;ui&s;t. However, the people thought it &s;ubtilty, and were not &s;atisfied.</P>
<P>He &s;tated, that, with regard to what had been done by them, they had burned his father's hou&s;e, and they might burn his; but he had enough beyond their reach.</P>
<P>As men of honour, he conceived, &s;o far from blaming, they could not but approve the intrepidity of Kirkpatrick, in defence of the hou&s;e of a friend.</P>
<P>The fact was, they did not di&s;pute the courage of Kirkpa|trick; but they accu&s;ed his ob&s;tinacy, in obliging them to do what they had done.</P>
<P>On the whole, the letter of Neville was not well couched, to an&s;wer the occa&s;ion. It gave great offence; and was con|&s;idered as an in&s;ult.</P>
<P>This, and other letters, being read, and di&s;cu&s;&s;ed a little, Benjamin Parkin&s;on addre&s;&s;ed the chair: "You know, &s;aid he, what has been done: we wi&s;h to know, whether what has been done is right or wrong; and whether we are to be &s;upported in it, or left to our&s;elves." The&s;e were the words: They im|pre&s;&s;ed me with an agony of mind. There was &s;ilence for &s;ome time. Mar&s;hall coming forward, ob&s;erved, that it was not nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay, whether what was done was right or wrong; but what is now to be done? I was relieved at this, and thought him in the right train.</P>
<P>Bradford now &s;poke: and to my great a&s;toni&s;hment declared his approbation of what had been done, and called upon the meeting to pledge them&s;elves to &s;upport it. His declamation was of con&s;iderable length, and extremely violent. Yet from my knowledge of the man, I doubted whether he &s;poke ac|cording to his wi&s;h, or harangued according to the humour of the people, and from a fear of them.</P>
<P>After he had &s;poken there was a dead &s;ilence. The que&s;|tion would be taken; Support, or not &s;upport? My &s;ituation was delicate. There was but a moment between trea&s;on on the one hand, and popular odium on the other: popular odium which might produce per&s;onal injury before I left the ground. To withdraw would be the &s;ame thing as to oppo&s;e.</P>
<P>Mar&s;hall came to me, a thing which I &s;u&s;pected from him, or &s;ome one el&s;e, and &s;olicited me to &s;peak. I had been plan|ning the &s;cheme of an harangue. Having &s;ettled &s;ome out|line<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> in my mind, I addre&s;&s;ed the chair.</P>
<P>I gave them a narrative of what had taken place at Pitt&s;|burgh, &s;ince Hamilton and Black had been there: That the
<PB N="33" REF="028332_0030_0FD899ED0D8C5688">
mar&s;hal with the revenue officer had left the country; and as was &s;uppo&s;ed, had a&s;cended or de&s;cended the river. That the in&s;pection office was &s;hut up, the label which announced it taken down, (and here I related the circum&s;tance of Craig taking it down, painting it with &s;ome humour, and making them laugh at his expence.) This with a view to impre&s;s the idea, that I was diverted with the cata&s;trophe of the office, and this as a &s;ub&s;titute for &s;aying any thing directly to approve what had been done. Putting them in good humour, I ventured to touch upon the &s;ubject more &s;eriou&s;ly. To avoid the giving a|ny vote upon the que&s;tion, I &s;tated "That we were not dele|gated for the purpo&s;e of giving a vote, but &s;imply to give a narrative of what had taken place there, with re&s;pect to the ex|ci&s;e office, in order to calm the minds of the people, and render it unnece&s;&s;ary for any force to come and take it down." It will be &s;een that I introduced the idea of a delegation, as an apology for not giving any vote.</P>
<P>"As an individual, however, I was willing to give advice: what had been done, might be morally right, but it was le|gally wrong. In con&s;truction of law it was high trea&s;on. It was a ca&s;e within the power of the Pre&s;ident to call out the militia." I &s;aw this &s;truck them greatly: They had en|tertained no idea that it would be cognizable otherwi&s;e, than in the county courts. But, &s;aid I, "the Pre&s;ident will reflect upon the difficulty of getting the militia to march. They will be reluctant from the midland parts of Penn&s;ylvania, from the upper parts of Maryland and Virginia. It will probably be nece&s;&s;ary to bring them from Jer&s;ey and the lower parts of the &s;tates. For this rea&s;on the Pre&s;ident may be di&s;po&s;ed to give an amne&s;ty." Here I &s;tated the amne&s;ty which had been given by the &s;tate of Penn&s;ylvania, in the ca&s;e of the riot at Wil&s;on's hou&s;e in Philadelphia, in 1779, as an example.</P>
<P>I continued to ob&s;erve, "That in order to obtain amne&s;ty, an application mu&s;t be made to the executive; that it would come with a better grace, and with more &s;upport from tho&s;e not involved, on behalf of tho&s;e that were, than from tho&s;e that were involved; that it was not the intere&s;t of tho&s;e involved, to involve others; but to let them remain as they were, in order to act as mediating men with the government." Here I di&s;covered rage in the countenance of Benjamin Parkin|&s;on, and others. They con&s;idered me as evading the &s;upport which was more agreeable; viz. the coming fairly in with
<PB N="34" REF="028332_0031_0FD899F066039528">
them in the tran&s;action, and making it a common cau&s;e. I &s;aw that they di&s;tru&s;ted the certainty of an amne&s;ty, and did not reli&s;h the idea of a&s;king it. I had therefore to impre&s;s two things &s;trongly; the nece&s;&s;ity of a&s;king an amne&s;ty, and the probability of obtaining it.</P>
<P>In order to impre&s;s the fir&s;t, I enlarged upon the want of power to &s;upport what was done; the &s;mall ba&s;is on which they had to &s;tand; a &s;mall part of a &s;mall country, not even the whole country we&s;t of the mountains, with them; unpro|vided at the &s;ame time time with arms, ammunition, and re|&s;ources of war.</P>
<P>In order to impre&s;s the la&s;t, the probability of obtaining an amne&s;ty, I &s;tated, "the evidences which the executive had al|ready given, of a di&s;po&s;ition to avoid war; even to a degree that was blamed, or perhaps, blameable; in the ca&s;e of the &s;poilations on our commerce, by the Briti&s;h, and in the ca&s;e of the Indian tribes. Here I introduced the countermand of the Pre&s;qu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i&s;le e&s;tabli&s;hment, at the interference of the executive of the United States, in con&s;equence of threats from Cornplanter, a Seneca Indian; and, in order to put them in good humour, and at the &s;ame time lead to the point I had in view, the prac|ticability of obtaining an amne&s;ty, I indulged a good deal of plea&s;antry at the expence of the executive, on the &s;ubject of Indian treaties: I introduced general Knox on the one &s;ide, and Cornplanter on the other; and made them make &s;peeches. Now, &s;aid I, if Indians can have treaties, why cannot we have one two? Returning gradually to &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s, I concluded, by propo&s;ing a larger meeting, perhaps co-exten&s;ive with the &s;ur|vey; and &s;ending delegates to the executive, on the &s;ubject of an arrangement with regard to what had been ra&s;hly, and, in legal con&s;truction, criminally acted: that if this mea&s;ure was adopted, though it would be inconvenient for me, and not a|greeable in the heat of that &s;ea&s;on, to take &s;uch a journey; yet I was willing to be one, to go to the executive."</P>
<P>I have been the more particular in giving the &s;ub&s;tance of my &s;peech on this occa&s;ion, and the clue to under&s;tand it, be|cau&s;e it has been mi&s;conceived; and the plea&s;antry which I in|dulged on the &s;ubject of Indian treaties, con&s;trued into a con|tempt of the executive. If the Pre&s;ident him&s;elf had been pre|&s;ent, perceiving my drift, he would have excu&s;ed me. How|ever, depo&s;itions were taken of this part of my &s;peech, and con&s;idered as an evidence of a <HI>male mens,</HI> a bad di&s;po&s;ition to|wards government.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="028332_0032_0FD899F1CBCA8A18">In the cour&s;e of my &s;peech, I had perceived different impre&s;|&s;ions, on the different de&s;criptions of tho&s;e pre&s;ent. Tho&s;e not involved, were greatly relieved, and &s;atisfied; and manife&s;ted this by the countenance, and by the nod of the head: Tho&s;e involved, the more di&s;cerning of them, were di&s;&s;atisfied; and manife&s;ted this by the countenance, and by the &s;haking of the head.</P>
<P>After I had done &s;peaking, there was a total &s;ilence; and the greater part left their &s;eats: a con&s;iderable part left the hou&s;e. I went out, and walked about; waiting to learn what the gen|eral impre&s;&s;ion was. My company from Pitt&s;burgh, commu|nicated to me, that numbers of the people were di&s;&s;atisfied, and there appeared to be a murmuring among&s;t them. Daniel Hamilton, who had been at the burning of Neville's hou&s;e, but who was per&s;onally well di&s;po&s;ed to me, came to me, and informed me, that there was a con&s;iderable di&s;&s;atisfaction at what I had &s;aid: that Benjamin Parkin&s;on, and that man, &s;aid he, pointing to a man in a blue coat, with a black &s;carf on his arm; and who, I have &s;ince been told, whether truly or not I do not know, was a brother of M'Farlane that had fallen, are &s;tirring up the people again&s;t you. On this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;tepped in, to ob|&s;erve what was doing there. I ob&s;erved the chairman, Edward Cook, James Mar&s;hal, David Bradford, and others, in a knot, or globe, in the centre of the hou&s;e, conver&s;ing with their heads together, in a low voice. I pa&s;&s;ed by, in a &s;low walk, along the entry of the meeting-hou&s;e. I was not a&s;ked to &s;top, or join in the deliberation. I walked back; and, as I pa&s;&s;ed, ju&s;t &s;poke to James Mar&s;hal, and a&s;ked what they were concluding on. He &s;aid he did not know. I thought my&s;elf not tru&s;ted, and withdrew.</P>
<P>I have &s;ince engaged Alexander Addi&s;on to make enquiry, and to find from Mar&s;hal, or Cook, what was the &s;ubject of deliberation at the time. He informs me, that they cannot re|collect that there was any thing material. I can only &s;ay, that the language of James Mar&s;hal, on the motion of Parkin&s;on, and the conduct of Cook, in nodding from the chair, with an appearance of a&s;&s;ent to me, in my propo&s;ing, that tho&s;e not in|volved, &s;hould remain &s;o, had impre&s;&s;ed me with an idea, that they were aver&s;e to violent mea&s;ures. However, I was &s;o a|larmed with what I then &s;aw, and what I had heard out of doors, that I immediately went out, and found &s;ome of my company, and gave the hint to get off as &s;peedily as po&s;&s;i|ble. They collected, and &s;et off. Mixing among&s;t the peo|ple,
<PB N="36" REF="028332_0033_0FD899F3304E5928">
I made an apology that my company were going, and no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> wi&s;hing to lo&s;e my company, I was about to go. I &s;et off, and met John Cannon, who wi&s;hed me to &s;tay. I &s;aid it was im|material, for that not being delegated, I could give no vote on any que&s;tion. Getting off to &s;ome di&s;tance, we were called upon: but we ha&s;tened our pace. Coming to the hou&s;e where we had left our hor&s;es, and having got them from the pa&s;ture, and dined, which might take up an hour; it was &s;ugge&s;ted by &s;ome of the company, that we had come off abruptly, and we might be accounted &s;pies; and it might be well if I would go back, and &s;hew my&s;elf, and make &s;ome apology. I had felt an im|pre&s;&s;ion of the kind my&s;elf; and taking my hor&s;e, I rode back, and di&s;mounting, and leaving him in a bottom at a &s;tream, at &s;ome di&s;tance, I walked up, as if I had not been at all away. I found that a great number of the people had gone, and &s;ome were going away. Tho&s;e remaining, were engaged in hearing &s;ome man, who was making the amende honourable, or ex|plaining &s;ome conduct, or &s;ome expre&s;&s;ions, which had indicated a di&s;po&s;ition to comply with the exci&s;e law.</P>

<P>IN the Pitt&s;burgh Gazette, of the 26th of July, appeared a recommendation, from the meeting at Mingo creek, to the four counties of Penn&s;ylvania, and the we&s;tern counties of Vir|ginia, to chu&s;e repre&s;entatives<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>"By a re&s;pectable number of citizens, who met, on Wedne&s;day, the 23d in&s;tant, at the meeting-hou&s;e on Mingo creek, it is recommended to the town&s;hips of the four we&s;tern Penn&s;ylvania counties, and the neighbouring counties of Virginia, to meet, and chu&s;e, not more than five, nor le&s;s than two, repre&s;entatives, to meet at Parkin&s;on's ferry, on the Monongahela, on Thur&s;day, the 14th day of Augu&s;t next, to take int<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> con&s;ideration <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he &s;ituation of the we&s;tern country.</P>

<P>When I &s;aw it, I was not alarmed; I conceived that what I propo&s;ed had been adopted; the in&s;tituting a negociation with the government, for the purpo&s;e of compo&s;ing the di&s;turbance. The taking in the counties of Virginia, did not appear to me inexpedient, ina&s;much as outrages on deputies under the ex|ci&s;e law, had been committed in &s;ome part of them. A Conven|tion would &s;eem the be&s;t means, on the one hand, to e&s;tabli&s;h principles of acquie&s;cence with the law, until it could be con|&s;titutionally changed; and on the other, to prevail with the government, on &s;uch a&s;&s;urances coming from the whole coun|try, to pa&s;s over what had taken place. I had no idea that the government would give an amne&s;ty, on any other principle, but that of gaining, for the future, a general acquie&s;cence; and that for this rea&s;on, an application from the individuals involved would avail little, becau&s;e they could promi&s;e but for them&s;elves only. However, conver&s;ing with general St. Clair, who hap|pened to be at Pitt&s;burgh at this time, I was &s;truck with his ob&s;erving, that &s;uch a Convention would be dangerous. I had not &s;een it in that point of view; not &s;uppo&s;ing that any other object would be contemplated, than &s;imply re&s;cuing the men who had involved them&s;elves in a capital offence, by putting it in the power of government to cover it with oblivion.</P>

<P>An act which was perpetrated the third day after the meet|ing, and of which Bradford was the author, &s;till further evinces it. But this act was projected before the meeting at Mingo creek. I &s;peak of the intercepting the mail. My information of the &s;ource of this, is a letter from Alexander Addi&s;on, of which the following is an extract:

<SALUTE>Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I have been pur&s;uing the plan for robbing the mail, and can trace it no higher than Bradford. It was propo&s;ed by him to
<PB N="39" REF="028332_0036_0FD899FCF5F34398">
Mar&s;hal, on their way to Mingo meeting-hou&s;e; Baldwin and David Hamilton were in company, and it was put on them to execute it. The object to be obtained was, to know the o|pinions of the people on the bu&s;ine&s;s carried on. The po&s;t to be robbed, was the po&s;t from Wa&s;hington to Pitt&s;burgh; and it was only when Baldwin and Hamilton &s;ent word, that they could not perform their part, and when it was then too late to intercept the mail to Pitt&s;burgh, that the plan was chang|ed to what was really executed. Bradford &s;ent his cou&s;in Wil|liam, and Daniel Hamilton, I believe, &s;ent John Mitchell, who executed the bu&s;ine&s;s. My information is from a good &s;ource, and may be depended on. The matter, I believe, was not talk|ed of at Mingo creek meeting-hou&s;e, nor did Edward Cook know any thing of it.</P>
</LETTER></P>
<P>I have &s;ince &s;een Baldwin, and gave him to under&s;tand what I had heard: he blu&s;hed, and his expre&s;&s;ion was, "How things will come out." He did not &s;eem to wi&s;h to give me the par|ticulars him&s;elf, and I could not, on principles of delicacy, urge. I have taken an opportunity of introducing the &s;ubject to Ham|ilton, but he waved it. I had a de&s;ire to know how it was, that the fir&s;t undertaking failed.</P>
<P>The po&s;t was interrupted on the 26th of July, on the way from Pitt&s;burgh, and near Green&s;burgh. The packet from Wa&s;hington and Pitt&s;burgh was taken out. It was carried by Benjamin Parkin&s;on to Wa&s;hington, and from thence it was ac|companied, by Bradford and Mar&s;hal, and others, to Cannon&s;|burgh, a village &s;even miles di&s;tant. It was there opened. No letter, on the late affairs, from any individual of Wa&s;hington: There were letters from individuals of Pitt&s;burgh; the&s;e letters gave great offence, and made the writers objects of re&s;entment.</P>
<P>The re&s;ult of the convention at Canon&s;burgh, at the open|ing of the mail, was the i&s;&s;uing circular letters to the officers of the militia, propo&s;ing a rendezvous at Braddock's field, for the purpo&s;e of a march to Pitt&s;burgh. The object of the march was, the taking the magazines of the garri&s;on, and any military &s;tores that might be found in the town. It was al&s;o contem|plated, to take the writers of the letters, and impri&s;on them in the jail of Wa&s;hington. The&s;e were the objects contemplated, according to the information given me: It may not be correct.</P>
<P>What was the object of intercepting the mail, is que&s;tionable. Bradford was a weak man; but yet it &s;eems hardly probable, that he could be &s;o weak as to think it any object to know what

people would think of what had taken place. He might ea&s;ily know what individuals would write from his town, knowing what they were u&s;ed to &s;peak in it. Knowing characters, he might know opinions. It is more probable, what has been &s;ug|ge&s;ted by men of that town, viz. that knowing what &s;ome would write, if they wrote at all; and expecting the&s;e might write, and being an enemy, and wi&s;hing an advantage, he ho|ped to have it in his power to turn the rage of the people on them. If this was his object, he was di&s;appointed in it: never|thele&s;s, he was &s;ufficiently incen&s;ed again&s;t the writers of the letters; and whether it was this re&s;entment, that gave ri&s;e to the idea of a march to Pitt&s;burgh, for the purpo&s;e of arre&s;ting the&s;e men, and this drew with it the idea of taking the maga|zine; or whether the taking the magazine was the primary ob|ject, and this incidently brought in, I am not &s;ufficiently in|formed. It would &s;eem probable, that the march to Pitt&s;burgh, and the taking the magazine, would have been, at all events, attempted, as a nece&s;&s;ary act to furni&s;h means of defending what had been done, the intercepting the mail. For it is to be pre|&s;umed, if we &s;uppo&s;e the actors in this affair to have had reflec|tion, that they had made up their minds, to &s;et the government at defiance: In that ca&s;e, it became them to arm them&s;elves with the means of war.</P>

<PB N="41" REF="028332_0038_0FD899FFF65AB410">
greater promptitude. When an officer di&s;approved of it, he did not dare to conceal from his battalion, or company, that he had received &s;uch a notice; and when communicated, it was the people commanding the officer, not the officer the people.&mdash; Call us out, or we will take vengeance on you, as a traitor to your country. The whole country was one inflammable ma&s;s; it required but the lea&s;t touch of fire to inflame it. I had &s;een the &s;pirit which prevailed, at the time of the &s;tamp act, and at the commencement of the revolution from the gov|ernment of Great Britain; but it was by no means &s;o general, and &s;o vigorous, among&s;t the common people, as the &s;pirit which now exi&s;ted in this country.</P>
<P>After my return from the Mingo meeting, I was called upon by great numbers from the country, on all &s;ides adjacent, in order to know the re&s;ult of that meeting. I &s;tated facts, but found, that, even on my own &s;hewing, I was not about to be the &s;ubject of eulogium. They wou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d have approved more de|ci&s;ive coun&s;els, and deci&s;ive mea&s;ures, to &s;upport what had been done. Said I, to &s;ome of them, What will be the con&s;equence? a war will en&s;ue. Well, &s;aid they, let tho&s;e that do not chu&s;e to &s;tand with the country, leave it; there will be enough be|hind without them: what they leave will help to carry on the war.</P>
<P>Knowing that the government could not po&s;&s;ibly overlook the outrages committed, and finding the&s;e di&s;po&s;itions in the people to &s;upport them, I &s;aw my &s;ituation perfectly; and can|va&s;&s;ed in my mind, the practicability of lying by, and remaining &s;pectator, or the nece&s;&s;ity of abandoning the country. I thought al&s;o of taking part, but the cau&s;e was not good; at the &s;ame time hazardous, and nothing to be got by it. A revolution did not &s;uit me, nor any man el&s;e that had any thing to lo&s;e, or was in a way of making &s;omething. A &s;ece&s;&s;ion of the country from the government, pre&s;ented nothing, that could be an ob|ject

with me. The repealing the law, by an exhibition of force, might be the only thing in view, with the people, at that mo|ment; but I well knew they would not &s;top there. The op|po&s;ing one law, would lead to oppo&s;e another; they would fi|nally oppo&s;e all, and demand a new modelling of the con&s;titu|tion; and there would be a revolution: or they would be &s;up|pre&s;&s;ed. For my part, I had &s;een and heard enough of revolu|tions, to have any wi&s;h to bear a part in one. But to lie by wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> impo&s;&s;ible; no man would be &s;uffered to remain neutral. I thought, therefore, of emigrating. The&s;e &s;entiments have not remained unknown to all, but my&s;elf; I have vouchers of them. But I could refer, more fully, on this &s;ubject, to general John Wilkins, with whom I conver&s;ed daily, and who found him&s;elf preci&s;ely in the &s;ame &s;ituation, and with the &s;ame reflections that I had. It had been con&s;idered, which way it would be mo&s;t prudent to withdraw. He thought of going up the Allegheny, into the woods, under a pretence of improving and &s;urveying lands. I thought of cro&s;&s;ing the mountains to Philadelphia: Nothing but the &s;uddenne&s;s with which the march to Braddock's fields came upon us, prevented my being out of the way, at that time. It was impo&s;&s;ible to make arrangements in &s;o &s;hort a period. When that came, I thought of nothing but weather|ing the bla&s;t, for the moment, and then making my e&s;cape.</P>
<P>Reflecting on the conduct of tho&s;e, who had now become the principal actor, on the &s;cene, I was not much &s;urpri&s;ed at that of Bradford: for I knew him to be capable of any folly; and the more ab&s;urd the mea&s;ure, he was the more likely to adopt it. But I was a&s;toni&s;hed at that of James Mar&s;hall, a man of good &s;en&s;e, cool and deliberate. I had ju&s;t heard of the part he acted in the intercepting, or at lea&s;t the opening of the mail&punc; and the orders for a rendezvous at Braddock's fields; when late in the evening, a relation of James Mar&s;hall; having called upon me, on bu&s;ine&s;s at my hou&s;e in Pitt&s;burgh, I &s;tated to him my &s;urpri&s;e at the conduct of Mar&s;hall; he &s;aid he had not &s;een him, for he was of a part of the county, con&s;iderably di&s;|tant from Wa&s;hington; but he was equally &s;urpri&s;ed with me. I explained to him &s;trongly my di&s;approbation of what had been done, and wi&s;hed him, as he was about to return through the town of Wa&s;hington, to explain my &s;entiments to Mar&s;hall. I have not &s;een him &s;ince, I mean the relation, and do not know whether he did or not.</P>
<P>But whether my &s;entiments were communicated to James Mar&s;hall, or not, the &s;entiments of others were, both to him and
<PB N="43" REF="028332_0040_0FD89A081DEA10D8">
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">radford, and with &s;uch effect, as to alarm them at the ra&s;hne&s;s of the &s;teps they had taken, and induce them to i&s;&s;ue orders of countermand for the rendezvous. The&s;e were actually &s;ent, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ome quarters, and received, and the march of the battalions arre&s;ted. Orders made out for other parts, and which had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ot been &s;ent, were not &s;ent at all.</P>
<P>The countermand of the rendezvous produced di&s;atisfaction <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the town of Wa&s;hington, and the adjacent country, and the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eople ru&s;hed in from every quarter and demanded that the bu&s;|ne&s;s &s;hould go forward. A large a&s;&s;embly had convened <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the court hou&s;e. James Ro&s;s, of the &s;enate of the United <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tates, in a &s;peech of great earne&s;tne&s;s, of two hours in length, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ndeavoured to di&s;&s;uade the populace; Thomas Scot, of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives of the United States, and Thomas Stokely, of the &s;enate of Penn&s;ylvania, David Reddick, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rothonotary, Henry Purviance, and others of the bar, exert|ed every means to di&s;&s;uade. James Mar&s;hall was in earne&s;t to retract, and &s;poke publicly. David Bradford &s;eeing the vio|lence of the multitude, by which he was always governed, be|came more inflammatory, than he had ever been, denied that he had con&s;ented to a countermand, and a&s;ked with confidence, who was the <HI>&s;co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ndrel</HI> who would &s;ay he had con&s;ented? Thomas Stokely <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">as &s;ince &s;een the countermand to colonel David Willi|ams, and in the hand writing of David Bradford, and &s;igned with his name. He has promi&s;ed me a certificate of this, and the original countermand,&mdash;if I have an opportunity I will pro|cure it.</P>
<P>It was carried that the march to Braddock's fields &s;hould go forward. To &s;hew their di&s;approbation of the apo&s;tacy of Mar&s;hall, the door of his hou&s;e was tarred and feathered that night. Threats were al&s;o thrown out of per&s;onal injury, and he was under the nece&s;&s;ity of declaring his readine&s;s to go forward. Threats were al&s;o thrown out again&s;t others. Indi&s;po&s;ition, lamene&s;s, pre&s;&s;ing bu&s;ine&s;s, was affected; many yielded to their fears, and thought it &s;afe&s;t to go. Others were di&s;po&s;ed to go, with a view of endeavouring to moderate the multitude, and and prevent outrages. Of this la&s;t de&s;cription there were num|bers of the principal officers of the militia, who came with battalions or companies, to humour them, and keep them from mi&s;chief. The common language of the county, at the time, was, they were coming to take Pitt&s;burgh; &s;ome would talk of plundering it; others of burning it. It was an expre&s;&s;ion, that Sodom had been burnt by fire from heaven; but this &s;econd
<PB N="44" REF="028332_0041_0FD89A08F05828E0">
Sodom &s;hould be burned with fire from earth. I believe plun|der was an object with many. The &s;hopkeepers were told a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> their counters, by per&s;ons cheapening their goods, that they would get them at a le&s;s price in a few days. The very women coming in from the country, would &s;ay, "that fine lady live<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> in a fine hou&s;e, but her pride will be humbled by and by." Per|&s;ons were coming to the black&s;miths with old guns, that had laid by a long time, to have them repaired. Others were buy|ing up flints and powder from the &s;tores; there were many that were &s;uppo&s;ed to be from di&s;tant parts, no one of the town knowing them. I &s;aw &s;ome, whom I took for &s;pies, who had been &s;ent to look at the &s;tate of the garri&s;on, or of the town. I traced &s;ome without appearing to do it, and found them loung|ing from place to place, without &s;eeming to have any thing to do.</P>
<P>We had &s;een copies of the order of march; and now it was under&s;tood, from various accounts, that the people were on their way to Braddock's fields. Major Butler had been indu&s;|trious to improve the defence of his garri&s;on; Major Craig had removed his family into it; Colonel Neville had prepared to defend him&s;elf in his own hou&s;e. It was thought advi&s;able to have a town meeting, to con&s;ider what was be&s;t to be done; notice was given of a meeting in the evening.</P>

<P>A Town-meeting was a&s;&s;embled about du&s;k&punc; almo&s;t the who<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> of the town convened; General John Gib&s;on in the chair; Mathew Erne&s;t, Secretary.</P>
<P>It was announced, ju&s;t at this moment, that individuals had arrived from Wa&s;hington, with a me&s;&s;age to the inhabitants of Pitt&s;burgh, which they wi&s;hed to deliver. A committee of the meeting was appointed, to wait upon the per&s;ons, and receive the me&s;&s;ages. The committee were general Wilkins, George Wallace, and my&s;elf. The individuals from Wa&s;hington were, Braid, Meetkirk, Blakenay, and Purviance. They had brought the mail, which had been intercepted, and were about to deliv|er it to the po&s;t-office, with the letters which had been in it, except certain letters from individuals in Pitt&s;burgh, which had given great offence, and which they were not to deliver; that the&s;e letters were from colonel Pre&s;ly Neville, to his father-in-law, General Morgan; General Gib&s;on to the governor of Penn&s;ylvania; James Bri&s;on, prothonotary, to the governor; Major Butler, to the &s;ecretary at war; and Edward Day, to the &s;ecretary of the trea&s;ury. That the&s;e letters had made the writers obnoxious; and that it was determined by the peo|ple, now on their march to Braddock's field, to take vengeance on them; that nothing could exceed their rage, that all po&s;&s;i|ble means had been u&s;ed, by moderate men, to re&s;train them; that a great number of the principal men in the country had thrown them&s;elves in with them, and were coming along, with a view to re&s;train violence; that the prevailing idea was to &s;eize the writers of the letters, and burn the town of Pitt&s;burgh; that after all the means that could be u&s;ed, it was doubtful whe|ther it could be &s;aved; that they had come, in confidence with the well di&s;po&s;ed, to give us notice, and concert with us, the means of our &s;alvation; that it was with great difficulty they had made their way through the people; that notwith&s;tanding it was with the knowledge of Bradford and Mar&s;hall, they had come, and who had delivered them the mail; yet in fact it was contrary to the wi&s;h of the multitude, who wi&s;hed no intelli|gence to be given, or an opportunity of e&s;caping afforded to the m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n who were to be &s;eized, or to the town it&s;elf; that in
<PB N="46" REF="028332_0043_0FD89A0C21DA7160">
fact they had been arre&s;ted on the way, and addre&s;s had been nece&s;&s;ary to be u&s;ed in order to be &s;uffered to come on; that there were two things which, in their opinion, it behoved the town to do; the one, to have the obnoxious per&s;ons &s;ent away, and the other, to affect to join the people at Braddock's field, and take away the pretence of coming to Pitt&s;burgh. For, that if they came, mo&s;t a&s;&s;uredly lives would be taken, and the town laid in a&s;hes; that the obnoxious per&s;ons were tho&s;e mentioned; but of the&s;e, Day and Bri&s;on peculiarly &s;o; that Abraham Kirkpatrick was obnoxious, on account of his defence of Ne|ville's hou&s;e, and his being &s;uppo&s;ed to be the cau&s;e of the death of M'Farlane; that the&s;e three were the primary objects of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">entment of the people; that others were &s;o, in a &s;e|condary degree. Perhaps it might be nece&s;&s;ary for them to go; but that unle&s;s the&s;e were &s;ent away, as a nece&s;&s;ary &s;acrifice to the re&s;entment of the people, there would be no po&s;&s;ibility of &s;top|ping them from coming to the town, and executing any purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>The me&s;&s;age from Wa&s;hington was announced to the inhabi|tants of Pitt&s;burgh, the names of tho&s;e, that were announced, read; Day and Bri&s;on were pre&s;ent; it &s;truck every one, and perhaps the&s;e per&s;ons them&s;elves, that it became nece&s;&s;ary for them to be out of the way; it was thought advi&s;eable by their particular friends, about them. They &s;eemed to acquie&s;ce, &s;o far as I could di&s;cover; I heard no objection. I do not know that Kirkpatrick was pre&s;ent, but Neville, his relation, was there; if he had any particular friends, they were there; for the whole town was pre&s;ent. There was no di&s;&s;ent by any one, no previous que&s;tion, no objection. There was no man &s;o de&s;titute of &s;en&s;e, as not to &s;ee the in&s;tant propriety of the mea&s;ure. It was generally and perfectly under&s;tood, that the&s;e per&s;ons acquie&s;ced in the policy of the manoeuvre.</P>
<P>It being then agreed upon, that the&s;e per&s;ons, on the one hand, &s;hould leave the town, under the idea of being bani&s;hed from it; and that the re&s;t of us &s;hould put on a ma&s;k of being with the people, and join them at Braddock's field, it was pro|po&s;ed, that a committee &s;hould be appointed to conduct the ma|nagement of the part we were to act: A committee of 21 was nominated by the chairman. It was entru&s;ted to the&s;e to draw up &s;omething that might be &s;truck off from the pre&s;s, and &s;ent forward to the people at Braddock's field, informing them of what had been done, and what we were di&s;po&s;ed to do.</P>
<P>The meeting being di&s;&s;olved, and the committee, now by our&s;elves, for I had been appointed one, particular per&s;ons,
<PB N="47" REF="028332_0044_0FD89A144B2C13B0">
the more intimate with Kirkpatrick, were directed to call upon him, and explain the circum&s;tance; it was under&s;tood, and an|nounced to us, on their return, that he was perfectly &s;atisfied of the nece&s;&s;ity of the ca&s;e, and would &s;et out in the morning. Day and Bri&s;on had been pre&s;ent, and there was no nece&s;&s;ity of &s;aying any thing to them. They had declared them&s;elves ready to leave the town. I heard Bri&s;on my&s;elf &s;ay, that he was perfectly &s;atisfied that it had fallen upon him, having no family; that he had entertained the idea of taking a ride below, at any rate, and the inconvenience would not be great to be out of the way a while.</P>
<P>It was agreed upon, to draw up, in the nature of re&s;olves, &s;omething which might an&s;wer the purpo&s;e of ma&s;king our&s;elves with the people. It was done, and 600 copies &s;truck off, at the pre&s;s, that night <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q><TEXT>

<P>A great majority, almo&s;t the whole of the inhabitants of the town, a&s;&s;em|bled.

<P>Late at night, the committee having di&s;&s;olved, Henry Pur|viance, of Wa&s;hington, came to me, and expre&s;&s;ed a concern of mind, that the gentlemen of his company, tho&s;e from Wa&s;h|ington, who had come with the me&s;&s;age, had, as he conceived, from motives of delicacy, he&s;itated to expre&s;s, in the ca&s;e of colonel Neville, and general Gib&s;on, the full extent of the dan|ger in which they were; that he could not conceive on what principle colonel Blakeney, who had undertaken to explain the
<PB N="48" REF="028332_0045_0FD88591A8152390">
information, had made a di&s;tinction in the ca&s;e of Neville and Gib&s;on: that they were certainly equally obnoxious with the others, and would be equally un&s;afe in the event of being found in the town, if the people &s;hould march in; and it was cruelty in the effect, though humanity in the principle, not to inform tho&s;e gentlemen of the whole predicament in which they &s;tood, I thought &s;o too; and that it appeared to me very extraordi|nary, at the time of the di&s;tinction made; for the letter of Gib|&s;on was preci&s;ely to the &s;ame effect with that of Bri&s;on; and that of Neville appeared to me more likely to give offence to tho&s;e, who had become leaders in the in&s;urrection, than any thing in the letters of the others. This, coupled with his be|ing the &s;on of the exci&s;e officer, would &s;eem likely to put him in the fir&s;t li&s;t of tho&s;e that ought to be pro&s;cribed.</P>
<P>However, it was thought advi&s;eable to explain this to our committee. Having collected them, or a greater part of them together, it was explained by Mr. Purviance. It was thought proper, that tho&s;e gentlemen, Neville and Gib&s;on, &s;hould be made acquainted with their &s;ituation, in the morning, that they might do as they &s;hould think proper. Mr. Purviance was re|que&s;ted to explain to them.</P>
<P>General Gib&s;on came to me in the morning, and appeared to have a ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of what had been explained to him; and
<PB N="49" REF="028332_0046_0FD89A15DE946650">
reque&s;ted my opinion candidly, as to his danger, and the expe|diency of his going to Braddock's field. I thought it not expe|dient that he &s;hould go; and added, that colonel Neville did not appear to me to have a proper impre&s;&s;ion of his danger, and that I &s;hould not think it advi&s;eable for him to go. Colonel Neville was anxious to go; but was prevailed upon not to think of it.</P>
<P>The fact was, I thought it not only un&s;afe for the&s;e gentle|tlemen to go, for their own &s;akes, but impolitic for us; as it would de&s;troy the effect of our ma&s;k; as it would naturally oc|cur, What! you in earne&s;t in the cau&s;e, and yet bring the&s;e obnoxious per&s;ons along with you, as good citizens&punc;</P>
<P>I had the &s;ame &s;entiments with regard to general Wilkins, and on the &s;ame principles, would have thought it advi&s;eable for him not to go to the rendezvous; and it was a great que&s;|tion, with the gentlemen of Wa&s;hington, and with his friends in Pitt&s;burgh, what he ought to do? the obnoxious adverti&s;e|ment was in the mouth of the people: However, he determin|ed finally to ri&s;k the going. Gib&s;on and Neville thought it prudent not to go.</P>
<P>Having marched, early in the day, to the place of rendez|vous, which was at the di&s;tance of about 8 miles, we halted two miles &s;hort of it, and waited until the me&s;&s;engers from Wa&s;h|ington, &s;hould go forward with a number of the hand-bo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s con|taining our re&s;olves, and di&s;pen&s;ing the&s;e among&s;t the people, di&s;po&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> them &s;avourably towards us. In an hour the&s;e gentle|men retur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">d <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">nounced a good effect from the hand-bills, and the information given of the expul&s;ion of obnoxious charac|ters. We then marched to the field, the committee in front, but without arms: this to evince that no oppo&s;ition was intend|ed on our part. Advancing to the field, my reflections were not plea&s;ant: I was far from thinking my&s;elf &s;ecure from per|&s;onal danger. I knew I had &s;tood, in general, well with the country, before this period; but I had given my&s;elf a &s;tab, as to my popularity, by what I &s;aid at the Mingo meeting-hou&s;e. I had under&s;tood, that a current of obloquy ran &s;trong again&s;t me, from that quarter. It had been announced, every day, in Pitt&s;burgh, by the people from the country. In fact, I was thought to be at be&s;t but a half-way whig, as the term was, and Bradford the real man to be depended on. I have &s;ince under&s;tood, that it was a good deal debated among&s;t the people, coming to the field, what my &s;entiments were with regard to the exci&s;e law. Tho&s;e per&s;onally well affected to me, gave it
<PB N="50" REF="028332_0047_0FD89A1B1BE8C680">
as a proof that I was again&s;t the exci&s;e law, that I had pub|li&s;hed, in Philadelphia, &s;ome years ago, in the face of govern|ment, &s;omething again&s;t the law, and put my name to it; and that I had brought &s;uit again&s;t the exci&s;e officer, for &s;omething done in the execution of his office. The&s;e circum&s;tances gave a favourable impre&s;&s;ion, and &s;ome were of opinion that my hou&s;e ought not to be burned; others thought that it might as well go with the re&s;t. That conver&s;ation of this nature took place, among&s;t the people, I have from many on the march with them to the field, and who were under &s;trong apprehen&s;ions that, af|ter all that could be done, great outrages would be committed.</P>
<P>But independent of any unpopular thing lately &s;aid or done, I well knew, that it was po&s;&s;ible there were per&s;ons there, who had a per&s;onal prejudice again&s;t me; though I could think of but two, that I thought it probable would be there, who had any; the&s;e were Benjamin Parkin&s;on and Andrew M'Farlane, the brother of him who had fallen before the hou&s;e of Neville. The prejudice they had entertained, was of an old &s;tanding; but I did not know but that it might &s;till exi&s;t in its full vigour. My backwardne&s;s at the Mingo meeting-hou&s;e, I had rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e, had increa&s;ed the prejudice of Parkin&s;on; I had con|ceived M'Farlane to be of a fixed and per&s;evering di&s;po&s;ition, and if he was di&s;po&s;ed to injure me, the advantage he derived from his brother's fall, would give him great weight among&s;t the people, and put it in his power. The idea of the people, at the time, was, that law was di&s;&s;olved, and that the people them|&s;elves, in their collective capacity, were the only tribunal. There could be no idea, therefore, that the putting a man to death, who was obnoxious to the people, would be any offence. I mentioned my apprehen&s;ions of M'Farlane and Parkin&s;on to &s;ome of our committee, as we rode; I think to Adam&s;on Tan|nehill for one.</P>
<P>Though I had &s;tood well with Bradford heretofore, yet I was apprehen&s;ive of him now. He might be di&s;&s;atisfied at my not &s;up|porting him at the Mingo meeting-hou&s;e; and he might natu|rally &s;uppo&s;e, that it was &s;ome of the company with me, or perhaps my&s;elf, that had communicated the account of his &s;peech on that occa&s;ion; of which &s;peech, the letters intercepted in the mail were conveying the intelligence to government; and on that account had drawn forth his re&s;entment again&s;t the wri|ters. I was apprehen&s;ive that it would be enquired, upon the ground, who it was that had communicated this information to the writers. The fact was, we had all given it. I though it
<PB N="51" REF="028332_0048_0FD88593B3434E68">
fortunate for us, that Bri&s;on and Gib&s;on, who had touched up|on this &s;peech, were not there, to examine them. We would not have dared to ju&s;tify the information, though we could not but acknowledge the having given it. We &s;hould have had to have admitted the po&s;&s;ibility of a mi&s;take, and &s;aved our&s;elves with the tyrant of the day, in the be&s;t manner po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>Under the&s;e per&s;onal apprehen&s;ions for my&s;elf, and for the Pitt&s;burgh people in general, it was propo&s;ed by me, when near the ground, to advance with a flag, which, even a mob might regard; and pulling out a handerchief, which happened to be white, I put it on my whip. The committee were of opinion, that we ought not to &s;eem to di&s;tru&s;t, and the flag was put down.</P>
<P>The fears entertained on this occa&s;ion, may appear unrea|&s;onable: not to any one who has &s;een a large and enraged body of men, under the command of one as mad as them&s;elves, or under no command at all. In the fir&s;t ca&s;e, they will execute what the one dictates; in the other, what any one &s;ugge&s;ts. In the pre&s;ent in&s;tance, I knew Bradford would have great in|fluence, but the people them&s;elves would have more; and there was rea&s;on to fear both. As to burning the town, it was doubtle&s;s more talked of, than intended individually; but the talking of it would produce the doing it, contrary to the wi&s;h of many who did talk of it. Such is the hi&s;tory of the human mind in a &s;tate of anarchy.</P>

I &s;aw him march by us, and di&s;covered in his coun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">nance &s;ufficient evidence of a &s;en&s;e of danger: though I knew him to be a man of great per&s;onal intrepidity; yet I did no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> wonder at his apprehen&s;ions. Nothing but his appearing at th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> head of the militia, who were now to be con&s;idered as friend<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to the cau&s;e, could have &s;aved him. I was thinking of his dan|ger, when I turned my head a moment, and was &s;truck with the very man I was mo&s;t afraid of, Andrew M'Farlane, ju&s;t by me. He was dre&s;&s;ed in a blue coat, with dark vi&s;age, low<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ing countenance, and a rifle in his hand, looking at me. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> eyed him in my turn, but did not venture to &s;peak. I tru&s;t|ed to his fear of the people, as he did not know perfectly how I &s;tood with them; after &s;ometime he turned about, and went away.</P>
<P>The next object that arre&s;ted my attention was Bradford walking before a number of battalions, that had ju&s;t cro&s;&s;ed the river, and were ranged upon the bank, to be viewed by him. I was &s;olicitous to know what my reception would be. I knew that from his going on to the intercepting the mail, and the pro|curing of this movement of the people, without my knowledge, he had not expected a&s;&s;i&s;tance from me; and his not communi|cating
<PB N="53" REF="028332_0050_0FD88594D3D71DE8">
his intention of it, di&s;covered a mi&s;tru&s;t of me. But I found our proceeding at Pitt&s;burgh had &s;atisfied h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">m; for he advanced and &s;poke to me. The u&s;ual <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">e&s;&s;ions by him and and every one el&s;e, were, Had we &s;ent away tho&s;e men? <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> there no danger of their coming back? our u&s;ual an&s;wer was, They were gone; they would not be &s;uffered to come back. Epithets of indignity were &s;ometimes u&s;ed with re&s;pect to them, to ma&s;k our &s;entiments the better. It was &s;aid by them, that more mu&s;t go. Every one, from Pitt&s;burgh, that I heard &s;peak at all, a&s;&s;ented to every thing that was &s;aid; for it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> a part of the &s;y&s;tem adopted; and we tru&s;ted to the arrangement that could be made, to &s;often all matters, and prevent injury to any one, in proportion as we our&s;elves could acquire confidence with the leaders, or with the multitude.</P>
<P>Having been &s;ome time upon the ground, I fell in with Benjamin Parkin&s;on, the other per&s;on of whom I had been per|&s;onally apprehen&s;ive. He was in a group of men whom I knew to be warm in the cau&s;e. I advanced with great appear|ance of confidence, and frankne&s;s of manner, and &s;aluted them; I was received with cordiality, and thought my&s;elf very fortu|nate. All, or mo&s;t of tho&s;e had been at the conflagration of the hou&s;e of the in&s;pector, and had heard me at the Mingo meeting; but the Pitt&s;burgh hand bill, and my appearance on the ground, now to join them, had effaced the unfavourable <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mpre&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>They &s;at in a group upon the ground, each with his rifle in his hand, or lying by him. I &s;at with them. The conver|&s;ation turned upon the burning of the hou&s;e; and they expre&s;|&s;ed great rage again&s;t Kirkpatrick, who had been the cau&s;e, as they &s;aid, of the burning it, and the death of James M'Farlane, by his refu&s;ing to let the hou&s;e be &s;earched for the in&s;pector's commi&s;&s;ion and his papers. They expre&s;&s;ed re&s;entment again&s;t Major Butler for &s;ending out &s;oldiers to the hou&s;e of the in|&s;pector. They had enquired for Orm&s;by, who had accompanied Neville the younger, and the Mar&s;hal from Pitt&s;burgh. I &s;aid he was upon the ground, but was &s;carcely worth enquiring af|ter. He was an incon&s;iderate young man that would go any where. He had gone there, and he had come here, and it was little matter what he did; that we had heard in what manner they had treated him, when they had him a pri&s;oner; that they had taken his hor&s;e and pi&s;tols and hanger from him; and put him on the bare back of a colt to ride, as a &s;teed congenial with his years and di&s;cretion. I had heard &s;omething like this;
<PB N="54" REF="028332_0051_0FD89A1F9DDBF778">
but whatever might have been the ca&s;e, I was di&s;po&s;ed to give them the impre&s;&s;ion that I was diverted with the circum&s;tance; and therefore put them on the relation of it, and laughed im|moderately; but concluded that he had been &s;ufficiently puni&s;h|ed by his apprehen&s;ions, on that occa&s;ion; and as he had gone there without the knowledge of his parents, and had come with their approbation here, it was not worth while to mind him. It was agreed it was not.</P>
<P>I did not know, that in the mean time, the young man had been on the point of a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination.</P>
<P>Fifteen men had painted them&s;elves black, as the warriors among&s;t the Indians do, when they go to war. They had gone in &s;earch of Orm&s;by. Zedick Wright of Peter's creek had di&s;covered it, and having a good will for the family, or from motives of humanity, made ha&s;te to give him intelligence of it. He had e&s;caped but a few minutes, not a quarter of an hour, when they were &s;een to pa&s;s by openly in pur&s;uit of him. He made his way to Pitt&s;burgh, in the cour&s;e of the day, by devi|ous routes, and lay concealed in the barracks of the old garri|&s;on, until the whole cavalcade was over.</P>
<P>I was greatly di&s;concerted, on one occa&s;ion, in the cour&s;e of this day by James Ro&s;s of Wa&s;hington. It was the fir&s;t time I had &s;een him on the ground, when, &s;itting with two or three others, at the root of a tree, pa&s;&s;ing by, &s;aid he to me, with a &s;mile, you have got a great of &s;ubtility; but you will have oc|ca&s;ion for it all. I was alarmed, and looked about to &s;ee who mu&s;t have heard him. There were none near me, but tho&s;e ju&s;t with with me, whom I knew, and who were wearing the the ma&s;k al&s;o. But I gave him to under&s;tand that he had a|larmed me, for he could not know the characters of tho&s;e with me; he &s;aid he did, and con&s;idered that before he &s;poke. Talking of the arrangements made, he thought the bu&s;i|ne&s;s well managed on part of the town; and that nothing el&s;e could have &s;aved lives and property.</P>
<P>People were coming in from every quarter all that day; gen|erally armed: but &s;ome without arms. It was impo&s;&s;ible to know the real &s;entiments of almo&s;t any one among&s;t the mul|titude: how far they were there from nece&s;&s;ity or of choice. Every man was afraid of the opinion of another. Sometimes a word dropped, which might be con&s;trued away, if not well taken, would lead to a confidence. The great bulk of the peo|ple were certainly in earne&s;t; and the revolutionary language and the ideas of the French people, had become familiar. It
<PB N="55" REF="028332_0052_0FD89A20EFF17BB8">
was not taring and feathering, as at the commencement of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">evolution from Great Britain, but guillotining; that is, put|ting to death, by any way that offered. I am pur&s;uaded, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">f even Bradford him&s;elf, that day, had ventured to check the violence of the people, in any way that was not agreeable to them; and had betrayed the lea&s;t partiality for the exci&s;e law; or perhaps even a remi&s;&s;ion of his zeal again&s;t it, he would have &s;unk, in an in&s;tant, from his power, and they would have hung him on the fir&s;t tree. Yet he was weak enough not to have fore&s;een this; it had been an argument u&s;ed with him, in di&s;|&s;uading him from a per&s;everance in the mea&s;ure undertaken, that no man could calculate the con&s;equence of putting the ma&s;s in motion, with arms in their hands. His an&s;wer was, that he could &s;ay to them, Hitherto &s;halt thou go, and no fur|ther. Certain it is that his influence was great. I &s;aw a man wade into the river, lift cool water from the bottom of the channel, and bring it his hat to him to drink. Applications were made to him that day for commi&s;&s;ions in the &s;ervice.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s, whatever his idea might have been, he would have &s;een the extent of his power, if he had ventured to tell the people that they &s;hould return without going on to Pitt&s;burgh. It was the object of all men who were apprehen&s;ive of the con|&s;equence, to di&s;&s;uade from this; but it appeared very doubtful, through the whole day, whether or not it was practicable. It was afterwards found that it was not.</P>
<P>Towards the evening, there was a council of the Pitt&s;burgh committee. It had been repre&s;ented to them, and was the fact, that the people from the town, not expecting to detain that night, had brought no provi&s;ions with them; it was &s;ugge&s;ted that they might be &s;uffered to return to town, and be at the place of rendezvous early in the morning. It was thought ex|pedient, and orders were given accordingly.</P>
<P>I had &s;een general Wilkins but little through the day; he had remained clo&s;e with the Pitt&s;burgh people, and ventured little though the multitude. On his fir&s;t coming, he had gone up to Bradford, apprehen&s;ive that he might denounce him, and addre&s;&s;ed him: "Sir, have you any thing again&s;t me?" No, &s;aid he. This re&s;olute behaviour probably prevented him hav|ing any thing to &s;ay.</P>
<P>On its being known that the people of Pitt&s;burgh were go|ing home for the night, there was a great clamour in the camp. It was &s;aid, they were about to de&s;ert the cau&s;e; and in fact never had been &s;incere in it.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="028332_0053_0FD89A2666497BB0">The fact is, there were of them &s;hrewd enough to di&s;cover this. Some would &s;ay, plea&s;ed with our addre&s;s, but who would rather have had us all in earne&s;t, "You have acted well; but we under&s;tand you. We give you credit for your management." It would be an&s;wered, "What! do you doubt our &s;incerity?" They would &s;ay, "We do not di&s;pute your good policy."</P>
<P>Finding the effect of the departure of the Pitt&s;burgh people, it was thought advi&s;eable to countermand the leave given. I rode after them with great ha&s;te, and turned them to the field; with orders not to leave it, let their want of food be what it might, rather than produce a di&s;&s;atisfaction with the people on the ground, and bring them irregularly, and in bad humour, to the town. It will be a&s;ked, Whence had I this authority? and how was I obeyed &s;o readily? I was of the committee to whom the power had been entru&s;ted of conducting all affairs up|on the occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>On my return with the Pitt&s;burgh people, I &s;aw James Mar|&s;hal, for the fir&s;t time, upon the ground. I &s;aw he was great|ly here in his mind at the trouble he had brought upon us; and had great &s;olicitude with regard to the event. I explained to him the di&s;&s;atisfaction that had taken place at the departure of our people, and wi&s;hed him to ride through the camp, and give information that he &s;aw us all returned. He mounted his hor&s;e, with his rifle in his hand, and &s;et out to do it.</P>
<P>In the cour&s;e of the day, a great &s;ubject of conver&s;ation had been, the taking the garri&s;on. It would &s;eem to have been the original object of the movement; but had been laid a&s;ide. On what principle I do not know; whether on account of the diffi|culty of accompli&s;hing it; or the projectors of the enterpri&s;e he&s;itating to make war &s;o immediately on the United States. I &s;hould rather think it was the danger of the enterpri&s;e that o|perated on the mind of Bradford: for he would naturally re|flect, that he could not avoid taking a part in the attempt him|&s;elf; and I have no idea that he was a man of courage under certain danger. The rea&s;on o&s;ten&s;ibly a&s;&s;igned, at the relin|qui&s;hment of this object, was, that it was found the military &s;tores in the garri&s;on were intended for the campaign again&s;t the Indians; and it would be improper to derange the opera|tions of that campaign, by &s;eizing them. This part of the en|terpri&s;e had been abandoned by the projectors of it; but the rumour had gone abroad, and it was not generally known to the people that it was abandoned. The query, every where, was, Were we to take the garri&s;on? I an&s;wered always, that

we were. The query then was, Could we take it? It was an|&s;wered, No doubt of it. But at a great lo&s;s? Not at all; not above a thou&s;and killed, and five hundred mortally wounded. This lo&s;s, to the more thinking part, appeared very &s;erious.</P>
<P>Various modes were propo&s;ed of taking it: Some thought of providing &s;takes, with &s;harpened points, and ru&s;hing up with tho&s;e, and putting them in the port holes, ob&s;truct the firing from them; while others were cutting away the pickets. In the mean time, others with their rifles taking off the men at the guns, in the block-hou&s;es of the ba&s;tions, as the Indians took off the artillery men, in St. Clair's expedition. I was a&s;ked, what was my plan of taking it? I &s;ugge&s;ted the under|mining and blowing up a ba&s;tion: but they would fire upon the diggers; be&s;ides, it would wa&s;te powder.</P>
<P>To &s;ome complaining, that called out &s;o ha&s;tily, they were not well furni&s;hed with provi&s;ions, I propo&s;ed &s;tarving out the garri&s;on; but the&s;e were apprehen&s;ive they would &s;tarve out them&s;elves.</P>
<P>After night I had a great deal of conver&s;ation on this &s;ub|ject, in the bu&s;hes, and at the &s;ides of &s;ences; laying our heads together, and whi&s;pering. I was for the mo&s;t de&s;perate mea|&s;ures; but admitted that much blood mu&s;t be lo&s;t.</P>
<P>About midnight, I rode through the camp, where the peo|ple were laying at the fires, in their blankets or without. I made a pretence of enquiring for the Pitt&s;burgh battalion; and this with a view, at the &s;ame time, to let them know that the Pitt&s;burgh people were upon the ground. My principal object was, to a&s;certain the determination of the people, with regard to their coming to Pitt&s;burgh. I found the univer&s;al &s;entiment to be, that they would &s;ee the town. There was little &s;leep in the camp. The firing and &s;hooting had cea&s;ed; but there was a continual conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>Coming up to a fire, a per&s;on to whom I was known acco&s;t|ed me: Is Kirkpatrick gone? &s;aid he. He is gone. And why the devil did you let him go? &s;aid a per&s;on &s;tarting up behind him. The que&s;tion came &s;o &s;uddenly upon me, that I was a little &s;truck with it; but recovering, I replied, that it was no fault of mine that he wont away; I would rather have kept him here, and puni&s;hed him by law. This was the truth; for I was pro&s;ecuting him at that very time, for mi&s;demeanors. The enrage, or enraged man, as I may call him, made no reply; but the per&s;on who fir&s;t &s;poke to me, gave me a touch in the &s;ide, and &s;aid, Come, take a dram: we will not detain you. This
<PB N="58" REF="028332_0055_0FD89A27CEBB58D8">
I under&s;tood to be a hint to go away. I give this incident, be|cau&s;e; that having mentioned it afterwards, it was u&s;ed by &s;ome as a proof that I had endeavoured to inflame the people again&s;t Kirkpatrick, by talking of puni&s;hing by law. It is true, the man de&s;erves my re&s;entment: neverthele&s;s, I had too much re|gard for my own feelings, and the opinion of the public, to a|vail my&s;elf of that occa&s;ion to do him any injury. But my expre&s;|&s;ion, in the ca&s;e mentioned, was equivocal; and was under|&s;tood by them as it was intended it &s;hould be under&s;tood; viz. as relating to the circum&s;tance which was the ground of their re&s;entment, the defending Neville's hou&s;e; my in&s;inuation was, that this was puni&s;hable by law. The thought was new to the man, and it occupied his mind for the moment.</P>
<P>Pa&s;&s;ing on to a range of fires, I found Hamilton's battalion. This had arrived late in the evening; it had been long expected, and was called the bloody battalion. The greate&s;t part of it had been at the burning of the in&s;pector's hou&s;e. We expected de&s;perate mea&s;ures when the&s;e came. It was commanded by John Hamilton, a man very moderate and rea&s;onable; and who was di&s;po&s;ed to re&s;train the people from violence, and with that view had come with them.</P>
<P>Daniel Hamilton, his cou&s;in, was the fir&s;t that acco&s;ted me; and wi&s;hing to &s;erve me with the people, called out, This is a true whig. But what do you think of that damn'd fellow, James Ro&s;s? he has been here, and all through camp, per&s;uad|ing the people not to go to Pitt&s;burgh. I &s;aw now that it was in vain to oppo&s;e the going; and it was better to acquie&s;ce, and &s;ay they &s;hould go. In that ca&s;e, there would be more ma|nagement of them, than if they came in &s;pite of oppo&s;ition. I &s;aw this, and took my part decidedly.&mdash;Damn the fellow, &s;aid I, what bu&s;ine&s;s has he with Pitt&s;burgh? the people of Pitt&s;|burgh wi&s;h to &s;ee the army; and you mu&s;t go through it, and let the damn'd garri&s;on &s;ee, that we could take it, if we would. It will convince the government that we are no mob, but a regular army, and can pre&s;erve di&s;cipline, and pa&s;s thro' a town, like the French and American armies, in the cour&s;e of la&s;t war, without doing the lea&s;t injury to per&s;ons or property. There was a general acclamation, and all profe&s;&s;ed a determi|nation to mole&s;t no one.</P>
<P>Returning to a farm hou&s;e, ju&s;t by the camp, where &s;ome of our committee were, I communicated the re&s;ult of my ob|&s;ervations. Some of them had been through the camp, in the &s;ame manner; and had the &s;ame impre&s;&s;ions that I had, with
<PB N="59" REF="028332_0056_0FD89A29371E8CC8">
regard to the impo&s;&s;ibility of preventing the people coming to town.</P>
<P>In the morning, having convened in the camp, and held a council of principal officers, it was propo&s;ed to form a commit|tee, to con&s;i&s;t of three deputies from each regiment, who &s;hould deliberate on what was to be done. Deputies being cho&s;en, and the committee met, of which I was one, as repre&s;entative, with general John Wilkins, and captain John M'Ma&s;ters, for the militia of Pitt&s;burgh; in order that our deliberations might be the more free, it was propo&s;ed to withdraw to &s;ome di&s;tance. We withdrew, and occupied a &s;hady ground in the wood. Ed|ward Cook was appointed chairman. Bradford opened the meeting, by &s;tating the cau&s;e of their a&s;&s;embling in arms; viz. in order to cha&s;ti&s;e certain per&s;ons, who had di&s;covered &s;enti|ments friendly to the exci&s;e law; that their &s;entiments had come to light through the vigilance of &s;ome per&s;ons, who had intercepted the mail, and found their letters; that the&s;e letters would &s;peak for them&s;elves. Here taking out the letters from his pocket, he read them and commented on them. That, from major Butler of the garri&s;on, giving &s;ome account of the outrages committed, and his &s;en&s;e of the atrocity. That, from Neville, the &s;on of the in&s;pector, alluding to the authors of the di&s;turbance and giving them the epithet of ra&s;cals. That, from Edward Day, &s;ugge&s;ting a project of carrying the exci&s;e law into operation. That, from general Gib&s;on, &s;tating a motion by Bradford, at the Mingo meeting, to &s;upport the outrages committed. That, from the prothonotary Bri&s;on, to the &s;ame effect. At the authors of the&s;e two la&s;t letters he appeared particularly enraged as di&s;tingui&s;hing him at the Mingo meeting, and repre&s;enting him as making &s;uch motion. Addre&s;&s;ing him|&s;elf to me, Were you not there? did I make &s;uch a motion? I looked at the man with a&s;toni&s;hment. Is it po&s;&s;ible, thought I, that you did not know the &s;cope of your harangue? you did not make the motion, but you &s;upported it, and that is all the inaccuracy in the &s;tatement of the letter. But is it po&s;&s;ible that you would regard the being di&s;tingui&s;hed to the government, as &s;upporting violent coun&s;els, when you have di&s;tingui&s;hed your|&s;elf &s;o effectually in the very act of obtaining the&s;e letters? however it was no time to explain; i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> would involve my&s;elf, and put it out of my power to &s;erve others, to enter into an alterca|tion with the Robe&s;piere of the occa&s;ion, by &s;tating, as the fact was, that if he did not make the motion, he &s;upported it. I therefore evaded it, by &s;aying, that the &s;tatement in the let|ter

<P>It was now the que&s;tion, what re&s;olution &s;hould be taken with regard to the&s;e men. It was propo&s;ed and adopted, that the que&s;tion with re&s;pect to them &s;hould be taken &s;ingly. The ca&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">f major Butler was con&s;idered fir&s;t: his offence was two &s;old; the interfering with the civil authority of the people, by &s;end|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ng a military force to the hou&s;e of the in&s;pector; and by cor|re&s;ponding with the government.</P>
<P>There was no man &s;o ra&s;h as to que&s;tion the illegality of the&s;e acts; but it was ob&s;erved by me, that being an officer of the United States, he was amenable to the executive, for any <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hing uncon&s;titutionally done; and on a repre&s;entation to the Pre&s;ident, there could be no que&s;tion, but that he would re|move him; at lea&s;t from the command in this country. It would be therefore mo&s;t advi&s;eable to take no order with regard to him, at that time, but po&s;tpone the con&s;ideration of his ca&s;e until the meeting at Parkin&s;on's ferry, and then remon&s;trate to the executive, and obtain his recal. It was agreed.</P>
<P>The ca&s;e of Craig was taken up next. It was ob&s;erved by me, that there was certainly ground of &s;u&s;picion of his being over zealous in behalf of the exci&s;e law; neverthele&s;s it might be bad policy to order him out of the country at this time. In his capacity of quarter ma&s;ter, he had the care of the military &s;tores that were &s;ent forward occa&s;ionally, and intended for the campaign at that time carrying on again&s;t the Indians; that it might derange the&s;e operations, and give offence to the people of Kentucky, who were al&s;o again&s;t the exci&s;e law, to di&s;turb the quarter-ma&s;ter in his arrangements, and prevent the forwarding the&s;e &s;tores. But he was al&s;o an officer of the U|nited States, appointed by the &s;ecretary at war, General Knox, and that the &s;ame &s;teps might be taken with regard to him, as with Major Butler; a repre&s;entation could be &s;ent, from the meeting at Parkin&s;on's ferry, to the &s;ecretary, with informa|tion that he was pro&s;cribed by us, and a demand that he &s;hould be &s;uper&s;eded in his office, and pro&s;cribed by him al&s;o.</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="028332_0059_0FD89A3427FEE828">The only difficulty that occurred to any one, in this ca&s;e, was the que&s;tion, By whom he was appointed, and to whom the repre&s;entation ought to be made? was it not the Pre&s;ident that had appointed him? James Ro&s;s, who was a member of the committee, but who attended late, came in ju&s;t at this moment; and being of the Senate of the United States, and of cour&s;e &s;uppo&s;ed to have an accurate knowledge of the &s;ource of ap|pointment, the que&s;tion was put to him, Who it was that had the commi&s;&s;ioning the quarter-ma&s;ter? It was his opinion, that though the Pre&s;ident was the con&s;titutional &s;ource of appoint|ment, yet that, in fact, the &s;ecretary at war had the nomina|tion in the&s;e ca&s;es. It was agreed, therefore, to addre&s;s Knox on the &s;ubject of Craig.</P>
<P>The&s;e being di&s;po&s;ed of, the ca&s;e of Gib&s;on and Neville, the two letter writers, was taken up. On their behalf I &s;poke al&s;o: and with regard to Gib&s;on, ob&s;erved, that he was a man of an inoffen&s;ive di&s;po&s;ition, not much harm with him; could do little injury, go or &s;tay; was a man in trade, and the being di&s;turbed would affect him in making remittances to his mer|chants; and the fraud, in that ca&s;e, would be theirs, not his; that it was no object to bani&s;h him. With regard to Neville, he had u&s;ed har&s;h expre&s;&s;ions, it was true; but it was under the influence of pa&s;&s;ion, and in a private letter to a relation.</P>
<P>It was di&s;coverable, that it did not go down well to pa&s;s o|ver all. There were many that di&s;covered ill humour; there were &s;undry &s;peakers for and again&s;t. In the ca&s;e of Neville, there was a man, leaning on one knee, with his chin upon the head of his &s;taff, and a &s;louched hat upon his head, who &s;poke &s;oftly, but with great eagerne&s;s, for Neville; but at this mo|ment, a man, whom I afterwards under&s;tood to be a captain Murray, with great liveline&s;s of manners, came forward, dre&s;|&s;ed in a light blue camblet coat, leather overalls, buff wai&s;tcoat, and a cutla&s;s by his &s;ide; he had not been pre&s;ent until that moment. The fact was, that fre&s;h battalions of militia were every moment arriving; and as they arrived, they cho&s;e de|puties to the committee. Murray, wi&s;hing to make up for his lo&s;t time, was very active now; and under&s;tanding the que&s;tion was, with regard to the bani&s;hment of certain individuals, he was &s;trenuous for the bani&s;hment. If it had been for hanging, it would have been the &s;ame thing; for the man had no re&s;ent|ment, politically or per&s;onally, but &s;imply wi&s;hed to di&s;tingui&s;h him&s;elf, and become con&s;picuous in the revolution.</P>
<P>I felt little or no concern in the ca&s;e of Neville, for I did
<PB N="63" REF="028332_0060_0FD8859936274030">
not &s;ee it to be of any con&s;equence to him, whether he was to go or &s;tay. I rather thought it was his intere&s;t to be &s;ent a|way, and I had under&s;tood that it was his wi&s;h to get out of the country. He actually expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to that effect, to the me&s;&s;engers from Wa&s;hington, who came with the intercepted mail, and applied to them for a pa&s;&s;port, mi&s;taking their au|thority. I had &s;een him, the morning of our march to Brad|dock's fields, and with as much anxiety of countenance as a man could di&s;cover, who conceived his life to be in danger; his ex|pre&s;&s;ion was, "The only thing I think of, is to e&s;cape a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ina|tion." Well, I thought of nothing but this, the &s;aving his life and property. For Gib&s;on I was concerned; not that I thought it would ultimately be of any damage to him to be bani&s;hed, but I &s;uppo&s;ed his feelings would be hurt for the pre&s;ent, and he might think it of con&s;equence to be &s;ent away.</P>
<P>I was &s;tanding by Bradford at this time; turning to him, I ob&s;erved, with &s;ome warmth, "the &s;ending away the people is a farce; it will be the be&s;t recommendation they can have to the government; they will get into office, and be great men by it; it is better to let them &s;tay and be in&s;ignificant where they are: you could not have done a better thing to tho&s;e that are gone, than to have &s;ent them off." My language was candid; and his an&s;wer was equally &s;o. But &s;aid he, "the people came out to do &s;omething, and &s;omething they mu&s;t do." I now &s;aw that, whatever his theory might have been, with regard to the extent of his power over the people, his feelings for his own &s;afety corrected his vanity; and he &s;aw the nece&s;&s;ity of giving a tub to the whale. He had heard the declamation of Murray, viz. that we mu&s;t be firm, and clear the country of di&s;affected per&s;ons, &amp;c.; and conceiving that Murray, ju&s;t fre&s;h from the camp, had brought its &s;en&s;ibilities with him, he was unwilling to relax in his di&s;po&s;ition, with regard to the expul&s;ion. We ought to be firm, &s;aid he, and unanimous.</P>
<P>At the fir&s;t withdrawing of the committee, and taking their &s;tation in the wood, we were followed by numbers, who wi&s;hed to hear the deliberation. The committee being opened, it was move<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&punc; and the chairman was directed, to inform the people, that it was our wi&s;h to deliberate in private. The chairman addre&s;&s;ed them to this effect. Some went away, and others did not; &s;ome came again, and others with them. There was a con&s;tant intercour&s;e between the committee and the camp. It was frequently told them, that we wi&s;hed to be by our&s;elves; but in &s;pite of all that we could do, we had a gallery of rifle|men.
<PB N="64" REF="028332_0061_0FD89A3531D11128">

But that did not con&s;i&s;t with the idea of doing things ef|fectually, and at once; and it was rejected.</P>
<P>Our undertaking to expel tho&s;e people was not readily re|ceived. It was doubted whether we would expel them. Thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> led to the que&s;tion. Whether tho&s;e &s;aid to be expelled, were ac|tually gone? It was affirmed by us, that they were gone; and we &s;tated the circum&s;tance, that they had cro&s;&s;ed the Allegheny river in the preceding morning, but whether to a&s;cend or g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> down, we did not know. It was doubted &s;till, either &s;eriou&s;ly or affectedly, as a rea&s;on why we &s;hould not be tru&s;ted with the expul&s;ion of the&s;e remaining. I make no doubt, but that the&s;e &s;cruples with regard to our &s;incerity of acting, &s;prung in the whole, or in greate&s;t part, from a wi&s;h to &s;eem extremely zeal|ous in the cau&s;e undertaken, and not an ab&s;tract principle of &s;everity; but it had the &s;ame effect. We were anxious to &s;atis|fy the doubt, but could not do it; until, fortunately, a young man, who had ju&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">me from the camp, announced, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> one of the &s;p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">es, in the &s;ervice of the &s;tate, again&s;t the In<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ans on the frontiers, had ju&s;t come in, and brought account, that he had &s;een Kirkpatrick and B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i&s;on ten miles, in what is called the Indian country, on their way towards Sandu&s;ky. I have never heard how this &s;tory originated, but it was not true: however, it &s;erved our purpo&s;e at the time; and the doubt now only was, that they would come back. We &s;ti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ulated that they &s;hould not
<PB N="65" REF="028332_0062_0FD89A36C4BE85F8">
come back. It was &s;aid by me particularly, that if they came back "they might &s;eize us in their place." It was &s;aid by one, "Remember the forfeit."</P>
<P>It was agreed, that the &s;ending away Gib&s;on and Neville, at the expiration of the time mentioned, &s;hould be left to the Pitt&s;burgh committee.</P>
<P>Bradford now moved, that the troops &s;hould go on to Pitt&s;|burgh. Yes, &s;aid I, by all means; and if with no other view, at lea&s;t to give a proof that the &s;tricte&s;t order can be pre&s;erved, and no damage done. We will ju&s;t march through, and taking a turn, come out upon the plain of the Monongahela's banks; and taking a little whi&s;key with the inhabitants of the town, the troops will embark, and cro&s;s the river.</P>
<P>James Ro&s;s, at this moment, &s;tepping from another part of the committee, and pa&s;&s;ing by me, &s;aid, "the veil is getting too thin, I am afr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">d it will be &s;een through." But the com|mittee had now ri&s;en, and were going away.</P>
<P>It is well for you, &s;aid Benjamin Parkin&s;on to me, that the committee has broke up in &s;uch a hurry; you would have been taken notice of, you gentlemen of Pitt&s;burgh. Give us whi&s;|key! we don't go there for your whi&s;key. This was &s;aid, grind|ing the teeth, and biting the lip. I con&s;idered his umbrage at the&s;e words, as no more than a pretence of a quarrel, and was alarmed; but made, in the &s;ofte&s;t manner, an explanation, that I meant no more than that we &s;hould drink together, and not any offence whatever; and that it would affect me in the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible manner, if any thing, inadvertently &s;aid by me, &s;hould interrupt harmony, and injure the cau&s;e. I got him to &s;eem &s;atisfied; but I rather &s;uppo&s;e, that he had begun to &s;u&s;pect me of not being in earne&s;t in the cau&s;e, and that this was the real ground of his re&s;entment.</P>
<P>A number of the Pitt&s;burg committee having met, it was pro|po&s;ed, and thought advi&s;eable, that &s;ome individuals, in whom major Butler would have confidence, &s;hould ride in before the multitude, and inform him of the &s;tate of things: that there was no intention of di&s;turbing him, and this, le&s;t he &s;hould mi&s;|take the ca&s;e, and fire upon the people; and they might &s;up|po&s;e the town in collu&s;ion with him, and make this a pre|tence of injuring it. Some members &s;et out, and went into town for this purpo&s;e. Others were di&s;patched, who undertook to have the boats ready, at a proper place, to tran&s;port the peo|ple; and water and whi&s;key on the ground where we &s;hould halt: that there might be no pretence of leaving the ranks, in order to obtain refre&s;hment.</P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="028332_0063_0FD89A3C3A400C60">Several members of the committee, and other inhabitants o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the town, alarmed at the idea of the people coming, had gon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> home, to put out of the way, &s;ome of their mo&s;t valuable arti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cles.

<P>Officers in the mean time having been appointed, Edwar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Cook and Bradford, generals, and col.

<P>Conducting the militia by what is called the Monongehela road, the route was at a di&s;tance from the garri&s;on, which i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> built on the bank of the Allegany river. Entering the town, and marching to the main &s;treet, to &s;atisfy the people, and wheel|ing to the left, and leaving the town, the whole body was halted on the plain to the ea&s;t of the town. By the be&s;t e&s;timate <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> have been able to collect, the numbers were about 5400. About a fourth of the whole numbers, at Braddock's field, had return|ed from thence, and not come to town. So that, at the place of rendezvous, there might have been in the whole, about 7000 men.</P>
<P>By the order of the committee every po&s;&s;ible provi&s;ion had been made for them on the ground, that the &s;hort &s;pace of time could allow; and as &s;oon as the Pitt&s;burgh militia, who had marched in the rear, could be di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from the ranks, they were employed in carrying water to the plain. Members of the committee &s;et the example, by carrying water and whi&s;key to the&s;e whi&s;key-boys, as they have been &s;ince called. I was em|ployed among&s;t the re&s;t, very bu&s;ily. I thought it better to be employed in extingui&s;hing the fire of their thir&s;t, than of my hou&s;e. Mo&s;t other per&s;ons thought in the &s;ame manner; and every man had at lea&s;t a hut that he could not afford to have plundered, or burned down. In &s;pite of all that could be done; &s;traggling companies left the ground, and came into the town, and were extremely in&s;ulting and trouble&s;ome. By order of the committee the taverns had been &s;hut up, but the tavern-keepers were under the nece&s;&s;ity of di&s;tributing gratis.</P>
<P>Great activity was u&s;ed by well di&s;po&s;ed men, to pre&s;erve or|der: General Bradford left all to his officers, and gave him&s;elf little trouble. I did not &s;ee him though the whole afternoon. He had retired to a bower, to cool him&s;elf in the &s;hade. There
<PB N="67" REF="028332_0064_0FD89A3D6FB13E68">
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e was expatiating to tho&s;e who had accompanied him, on the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">bject accompli&s;hed, the expul&s;ion of the obnoxious characters.</P>
<P>It was an object of moment for the &s;afety of the town, to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ave the multitude thrown acro&s;s the river, as &s;peedily as po&s;&s;i|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">le. There were but three or four boats that could be collect|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d from the ferries, and it would take a long time to tran&s;port <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o great a number with the&s;e. But it was recollected that the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">or&s;e, which might be a third of the number, could ford the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">iver. Knowing the ford, which is at the confluence of the Monongehela and Allegheny rivers, I rode down and attempt|ed it; it was found to be practicable. Returning and leading <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">own a few &s;quadrons, they cro&s;&s;ed. When it had been announc|ed, that the river was fordable, the whole of the multitude, that had come on hor&s;e-back, came down and cro&s;&s;ed the river. The foot in the mean time, the greate&s;t part, had cro&s;&s;ed, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e had the pro&s;pect of having the town clear that night.</P>
<P>But notwith&s;tanding all exertions, an hundred or two had remained in the town; the&s;e were in concert with &s;ome of the&s;e who had cro&s;&s;ed the river, and who were to burn &s;ome farm buildings belonging to Kirkpatrick on the hill oppo&s;ite the town; and the inflaming the&s;e, was to be the &s;ignal to tho&s;e in town, to &s;et on fire his hou&s;e, in town. It was al&s;o &s;aid, that the hou&s;e of the company who&s;e clerk Day had been, and Gib&s;on's hou&s;e, Neville's, and that in which Bri&s;on had lived, were to be con&s;umed. The burning the&s;e, from their &s;ituation, would have burned the quarter part of the town. But if they had begun to burn at all, the whole would have been burned.</P>
<P>A company commanded by a captain Riddle, dre&s;&s;ed in yellow hunting &s;hirts, were &s;een in the evening parading the town, as having &s;omething in view. They appeared bent on mi&s;chief. About 9 o'clock at night, the alarm was, that the&s;e, and others, were about to burn the hou&s;e of Kirkpatrick. The inhabitants were called upon to defend it; I found general Wilkins, and a number with arms, ru&s;hing down. I addre&s;&s;ed them, "This will not do; it is contrary to the &s;y&s;tem we have hitherto pur|&s;ued, and which has been &s;ucce&s;sful. Return, and lay down your arms. If a drop of blood is &s;hed between the town and the country, it will never be forgiven: it will be known, that there is a tumult in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">own, between the inhabitants and the country people; and tho&s;e that have cro&s;&s;ed the river, many of them will return, and we &s;hall fall a &s;acrifice. If the hou&s;e is
<PB N="68" REF="028332_0065_0FD89A3F07163D50">
to be defended, it mu&s;t be by the people of the country them|&s;elves."</P>
<P>In fact, a number of the people of the country were at this time in arms, to a&s;&s;i&s;t in defending the hou&s;e. James Mar&s;hall and Edward Cook, and a brother of M'Farlane that had fallen, had gone down. He had been called forward on the prin|ciple, that being &s;uppo&s;ed to have the greate&s;t cau&s;e of re&s;ent|ment again&s;t Kirkpatrick, if he &s;hould oppo&s;e the burning, no other could, with a good grace, in&s;i&s;t.</P>
<P>It was on the &s;ame principle, (an incident which I had for|got in my narrative), that the committee of Braddock's fields had &s;ent for Andrew M'Farlane; and repre&s;enting to him our apprehen&s;ions of injury to the property of Kirkpatrick, reque&s;t|ed him, as we well knew it would be no gratification to a man of &s;en&s;e, as he was, to de&s;troy the property, even of one by whom his family had been injured, that he would expre&s;s his &s;entiments in the camp, and make it as public as po&s;&s;ible. His an&s;wer was, "that he had no with to injure the property, and would declare it publicly; but that if ever Kirkpatrick and he &s;hould meet, one of them &s;hould die."</P>
<P>Tho&s;e in arms, with general Wilkins, re&s;ted where they were. Going forward, I addre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf to the people that were going forward for the purpo&s;e of burning the hou&s;e. Said I, Gentlemen, you cannot burn this hou&s;e without burning that of colonel O'Hara, that is near it; he is a good man, and he is ab&s;ent. If it is to be de&s;troyed, let it be pulled down, not burned. I will be the fir&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o pull a board off my&s;elf; but what nece&s;&s;ity to take the trouble now; or to give your&s;elf the trouble at all? the people of Pitt&s;burgh will pull it down, and throw it in the river.</P>
<P>The&s;e de&s;i&s;ted to go forward. There had been &s;ome at the hou&s;e, and were preparing to &s;et fire, when Cook, Mar&s;hall, and M'Farlane came forward, and prevented it. A mi&s;take of Cook was fortunate. Thinking tho&s;e he &s;aw before him, at the hou&s;e, to be of the per&s;ons that were there to defend it; &s;aid he, Boys, are your guns loaded? Yes. "Then put in a &s;econd ball; and the fir&s;t man that puts fire to the hou&s;e, &s;hoot him down." Some affected to be there to defend the hou&s;e, and &s;ome went off.</P>
<P>In the mean time, intelligence had been brought, that the people were about to de&s;troy the buildings of Kirkpatrick, on the &s;outh &s;ide of the river; I fell in with David Hamilton and Thomas Stokely, about to cro&s;s for the purpo&s;e of di&s;&s;uading
<PB N="69" REF="028332_0066_0FD89A406E703EA0">
from it; I cro&s;&s;ed with them, to direct the ferry boats to be &s;ent over to the town &s;ide of the river, in order to prevent any part of tho&s;e a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">eady over, from re-cro&s;&s;ing to the town. Hav|ing ordered the boats over, I was returning, when the flame of a building of Kirkpatrick's, on the hill, began to illuminate the river. It was a barn, with the produce of the harve&s;t in it. This had been the &s;ignal agreed upon, for the inflammation of the hou&s;e of Kirkpatrick in town, or other buildings. This had been prevented, by the mea&s;ures taken.</P>
<P>I have been minute in my relation of the incidents that re&s;pect Kirkpatrick's hou&s;e, and my concern to &s;ave it, becau&s;e it has been in&s;inuated, that I had a wi&s;h to have it burned. I do not affect a regard for the man, for I have none; and it is no pre|&s;umption of my regard for him, that I wi&s;hed to &s;ave his hou&s;e; but rather the contrary; for I well knew that, if burned, he would make five times the value of it, out of it. It was in &s;ome degree for the &s;ake of the people them&s;elves, that I wi&s;hed to &s;ave them from doing mi&s;chief. How would Kirkpatrick make five times the value, by the de&s;truction of his property? It would be con&s;idered as de&s;troyed in the cau&s;e of the government; and therefore liberally repaired. The being the brother-in-law of the in&s;pector, would e&s;tabli&s;h a connection between his lo&s;s and that of the officer.</P>
<P>That plunder had been an object with many of the multitude, is certain. Among&s;t other proofs of this, I &s;aw a man, on Braddock's fields, put his hat, an indifferent one, on the muz|zle of his rifle, and twirling it about, &s;ay, I have a bad hat now, but I expect to have a better one &s;oon. On the day the people marched into Pitt&s;burgh, there were numbers of wom<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n on the hills oppo&s;ite the town, from a con&s;iderable di&s;tance, col|lected to &s;ee the de&s;truction of the town, and to &s;hare in the plunder. The day &s;ucceeding, a body, near a thou&s;and, at the di&s;tance of four or five miles halted, and deliberated, and with difficulty were prevented from coming back to plunder. On their way, on another road, by the farm hou&s;e of Neville the younger, where a tenant lived, who had been a deputy un|der the in&s;pector, they deliberated on the plundering and burn|ing the hou&s;e, and pre&s;ented their pieces to &s;hoot the wife of the deputy.</P>
<P>It will be queried, Whence the authority&punc; that I in&s;inuate my&s;elf to have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, in the interfering with the orders of general Wilkins, with regard to the defence of Kirkpatrick's hou&s;e, by the militia of the town; and in ordering ferry boats
<PB N="70" REF="028332_0067_0FD89A44FA2E2E28">
from one &s;ide of the river to the other; to remain all night with the hands, to prevent the re-cro&s;&s;ing of the people? I have al|ready &s;aid, that I was a member of the conmittee, which was &s;uppo&s;ed to have &s;uper&s;eded, for that occa&s;ion, all other au|thority. We were a kind of national commi&s;&s;ioners. The idea &s;truck Henry Purviance, of Wa&s;hington, who addre&s;&s;ed me by the de&s;ignation of Commi&s;&s;ioner Brackenridge. General Wil|kins was therefore no general now; I was a member of the committee, and had an equal power with him, and might a&s;&s;ume more &s;ometimes; and if not conte&s;ted, it was exerci&s;ed.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IX.</HEAD>
<P>THE affair of Braddock's fields, and the marching to the town of Pitt&s;burgh, being over, it will be a&s;ked, Could 250 or 300 men, which was the extent of the militia of the town, at the time, maintain it again&s;t 7000? but there might not be 7000; but &s;uppo&s;e only 700. The people of the town were not u&s;ed to arms; they might parade, on a review day, with empty mu&s;kets in their hands, but had no other prac|tice. They had the advantage of buildings out of which to fire; but &s;o had Kirkpatrick, at Neville's hou&s;e: and yet the buildings were burned. But the inhabitants of Pitt&s;|burgh were more, than the party of Kirkpatrick, and the hou&s;es more than the hou&s;es of the in&s;pector: but the force of the country was proportionably more again&s;t it; and if this force had been repul&s;ed, is it to be &s;uppo&s;ed that a greater force would not return? but there mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed to be a proportion of the town that had not yet acquired the &s;ame pro|perty with others, and would not like to put their lives to an equal ri&s;k in defence. Another proportion, from an acquaintance or connection with the country, would pre&s;ume them&s;elves &s;afe, and would not chu&s;e to defend. The garri&s;on could have been of no u&s;e; for they could have taken the town between the garri&s;on and them. They might have taken the garri&s;on it&s;elf; it was a quadrangle with ba&s;tions &s;tockaded, and a block-hou&s;e in the north-we&s;t, and north-ea&s;t angles, with a 6 or 9 pounder in each. But the ba&s;tions towards the town were na|ked of cannon; and the port holes might have been clo&s;ed, and the pickets cut away. The people were mad; and if any man
<PB N="71" REF="028332_0068_0FD89A466F4011C0">
wi&s;hes to calculate the force of madne&s;s, let him think of the French revolution, and the &s;torming the Ba&s;tile, and the Thuil|ries. It never came into my head, nor did I hear any one el&s;e, &s;ugge&s;t the idea, of u&s;ing force on this occa&s;ion. I thought it the &s;afe&s;t way to give good words, and good drink, rather than balls and powder. It co&s;t me four barrels of old whi&s;key, that day, and I would rather &s;pare that, than a &s;ingle quart of blood.</P>
<P>But it will be &s;aid, that the &s;eeming to join the people at Braddock's fields, and to &s;upport them in their views, did great public mi&s;chief, as it deceived numbers in the country, and lead them to an oppo&s;ition to the laws, or confirmed them in it; and that it would have been better for the government, for us to have, at lea&s;t, remained at home, or to have made our e&s;cape from the town. It is difficult to &s;ay, which has had the be&s;t effect generally; I admit the truth and full force of the ob&s;er|vation, that it was calculated to give a temporary confidence of &s;trength; but on the other hand, the de&s;perate act of plunder|ing and burning the town, in whole, or in part, would have led the perpetrators to every po&s;&s;ible extent of violence, in order to protect what had been done; and no po&s;&s;ibility of accommoda|tion with government could exi&s;t after &s;uch an outrage. But in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, it was like the raking of the leaves towards the flame, when the woods are on fire: the burning is greater for the moment, but it cannot pa&s;s the path, where there is nothing to &s;eed it.</P>
<P>It will be a&s;ked, how can we ju&s;tify the &s;ending away the pro&s;cribed per&s;ons? I know of no ca&s;e in our law, &s;trictly par|allel. I recollect an oriental ca&s;e, that may come near it. It is reported in the Negari&s;tan.</P>
<P>Two travellers pa&s;&s;ing by a pool, on the &s;ide of the road, one of them, mi&s;&s;ing a foot, &s;ell in. The &s;urface of the pool was &s;ome feet beneath the level of the bank, and of it&s;elf deep; laying hold of the bank, he &s;truggled to get up, but it was &s;teep, and he could not.

and laid it before the califf, who was puzzled, and too the opinion of a famous lawyer, Ala Jo&s;eph.</P>

He had thought more deeply on the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>A day or two after this, Henry Purviance, of Wa&s;hington, gave me to under&s;tand, that Neville the younger had expre&s;&s;ed to him his &s;u&s;picion that I was in confidence with Bradford, and had been privy to the intercepting the mail; and had laid the plan of the expul&s;ion of the per&s;ons denounced; and this with an immediate view to them particularly. It was ob&s;erved to him, that this was totally improbable; as I could not, at the time of projecting the intercepting the mail, provide that tho&s;e per&s;ons &s;hould write letters by it. This would exceed the power of any one, that had not an invi&s;ible power over the minds of individuals, &s;o as to make them act as the projector wi&s;hed.</P>
<P>This ob&s;ervation was deci&s;ive. I mu&s;t have had a &s;uperna|tural power, or uncommon good fortune, in having the&s;e per|&s;ons to do what would give pretence for the expul&s;ion, which had been previou&s;ly projected.</P>
<P>Neville could not an&s;wer this; but &s;aid, that if I had not pro|jected it; I was plea&s;ed with it now, that it had taken place.</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="028332_0070_0FD89A496DD0ED78">I was &s;truck, for the fir&s;t time, with the knowledge that Neville had not a perfect confidence in me; but it did not make much impre&s;&s;ion on me, as I conceived him in a fever; and, like per&s;ons in a fever, ready to complain of tho&s;e that were taking the be&s;t care of them.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e me to have been inimical to him, and the others; would expul&s;ion have &s;erved my turn? would I not rather have had them knocked in the head at once? had any arrangements been made to keep them away? would not the government re|&s;tore them? It was like &s;chool-boys ba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing out a ma&s;ter in the Chri&s;tmas holidays. They would come back again. No; I knew the &s;ending them away might wound their feelings for the moment, but would not do them any e&s;&s;ential or permanent in|jury. On the contrary, it would ultimately &s;erve them. It would hold them up as martyrs of the government, and give them offices and emoluments. I expre&s;&s;ed this at the time; and it has &s;o happened with &s;ome of them.</P>
<P>It was &s;aid, that I had been at variance with all the&s;e per|&s;ons. I had with Kirkpatrick, but with none el&s;e, to my know|ledge. If there was any variance, it was in their minds only, and not known to me. There had been a variance with Gib|&s;on, but it had pa&s;&s;ed away; at lea&s;t I had forgot it. There might he &s;till a degree of di&s;tance; but it was the aukwardne&s;s of pride in coming to a formal reconciliation&punc; With Neville I had no difference, real or apparent: but his ob&s;ervation &s;hews, that he was not well di&s;po&s;ed towards me. With Day there was both a real and apparent good under&s;tanding. I knew Bri|&s;on to have had malice of an old &s;tanding again&s;t me; but I had thought it was dead. I never had any again&s;t him. As to Kirkpatrick, I was pro&s;ecuting him for mi&s;demeanors. But it was defeating my purpo&s;e to &s;end him away. I had him under recognizance to court.</P>
<P>The &s;econd day after the departure of the multitude from Pitt&s;burgh, it was rumoured that Kirkpatrick had been &s;een in town. It was traced to an inhabitant of Pitt&s;burgh, who &s;aid; he had it from a per&s;on from the country, who &s;aid he had &s;een him. The committee was called, to enquire of this inhabitant; and cen&s;ure him, if, without foundation, he had circulated this report. As the committee were meeting, at a public hou&s;e, Neville the younger, and Craig, were coming down from the garri&s;on: they were interrogated, and acknowledged, that Kirk|patrick had returned to town, and was then in the garri&s;on. It excited great indignation, becau&s;e he had deceived us, leading
<PB N="74" REF="028332_0071_0FD89A4FA1434A10">
us to &s;uppo&s;e that he had gone, and to pledge our&s;elves to that effect. Neville and Craig alleged, that he had not intended to return, but that he had been dogged by parties, and had been under the nece&s;&s;ity of returning, to be &s;afe. It was an&s;wered, why not then have given early information to the committee, that they might have taken mea&s;ures to e&s;cort him? Neville &s;aid, that he had not known of his being in town until within half an hour; and on &s;aying this, they left us. It was thought ill u&s;age, after all the paine we had taken on behalf of Kirkpa|trick. If he had gone to the garri&s;on at fir&s;t, there could have been nothing &s;aid about it; but the being there now, would not excu&s;e us, who woul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> be &s;uppo&s;ed to have deceived the country. The committee were determined on deci&s;ive mea&s;ures. Having had a difference with the man, I gave this as an apology, and declined acting; but the re&s;olution was, that Neville and Craig &s;hould be &s;eized in his place, and &s;ent to Wa&s;hington. Per&s;ons were di&s;patched to demand their per&s;ons. It was be|lieved that they were privy to his being in the neighbourhood of the town, the whole time; and that he had never attempted to go away. Craig made his e&s;cape to the garri&s;on; Neville gave his word of honour, that in half an hour he would appear before the committee. He did appear, and came up &s;moking a &s;egar. I conceived the man was amu&s;ing him&s;elf with our con|cern; and in fact he was, or affecting to do &s;o; for his pride was wounded, and he had mi&s;conceived the &s;incerity of our good will, and earne&s;t de&s;ire to &s;ave every one, and hurt none. He pa&s;&s;ed by me with that compre&s;&s;ed laugh, which conveys in|&s;ult without &s;aying any thing. I &s;aw that he con&s;idered me as diverted with his embarra&s;&s;ment: he did me great inju&s;tice.</P>
<P>However, when he came before the committee, he expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf with di&s;cretion, and gave a&s;&s;urance, that if they would provide Kirkpatrick with an e&s;cort, he would leave the garri|&s;on, and go away. This had been offered to him when he went at fir&s;t, but he declined taking it. The committee undertook to do this, and an e&s;cort was provided.</P>
<P>Some of the people of the town, who had heard that Kirk|patrick was in the garri&s;on, and not knowing that the commit|tee had taken mea&s;ures, had determined to lay in wait for him; pre&s;uming that he would come out in the night. Their view was, to take him and &s;urrender him to the country. It has been &s;aid, that &s;ome talked of &s;hooting him; and that he was actually fired upon, as he came out of the garri&s;on, when he went away.</P>
<P><PB REF="028332_0072_0FD89A5117DAF6D0">The committee hearing this, next day, called a town meet|ing in the evening, in order to explain to the people the impro|priety of &s;uch behaviour; all things that regarded the police of the country, or the management of the affairs of the times, having been delegated to them, for the occa&s;ion. It had be|come nece&s;&s;ary on another account; the idea had prevailed, that all law was at an end, that a ju&s;tice of the peace could i&s;&s;ue no warrant, or con&s;table &s;erve it.</P>
<P>It was put on me to harangue the meeting, which I did; and denounced, in &s;trong terms, the impropriety of acting as in the ca&s;e of Kirkpatrick, without the orders of the committee; informing them al&s;o, that law was in force.</P>
<P>I was diverted with an expre&s;&s;ion of John Wilkins, &s;enior, on this occa&s;ion&mdash;"It is only the exci&s;e law that is repealed."</P>
<P>I had &s;aid, that it was only that law that the country had &s;u&s;pended. It will be &s;een from hence, the manner in which we had to accommodate our language, even to the town of Pitt&s;burgh.</P>
<P>Had the denounced per&s;ons left the country immediately, be|fore it became known exten&s;ively that they were obnoxious, they could have got out of it without difficulty; but it was no ea&s;y matter afterwards. The cau&s;e of their pro&s;cription was not di&s;tinctly known; and it was thought to be &s;ome great &s;tate crime that had come to light. The people had an idea, that it would be no harm to &s;hoot them down; at lea&s;t to arre&s;t and impri&s;on them.</P>
<P>Kirkpatrick was to have had an e&s;cort of two men, but one only had been able to join him; the other had been detained by the people, who, not knowing the mea&s;ures of the commit|tee, were lying in wait, to apprehend him. With the per&s;on that had been able to join him, he e&s;caped, by a circuitous route, on the frontiers of the country, as far as the Allegheny moun|tains, and then ventured to take the road.</P>
<P>Prothonotary Bri&s;on had been detained a night at the hou&s;e of the deputy attorney for the commonwealth, at the di&s;tance of &s;ome miles from Pitt&s;burgh. It was rumoured in the neigh|bourhood, that he was there &s;till. A party, of about forty per&s;ons, had collected in the night, and &s;urrounded the hou&s;e. They demanded of the attorney, to give them entrance, that they might &s;earch for the culprit. It could not be refu&s;ed. The lady of the attorney had fainted with the fright; a mulatto wo|man had been di&s;patched to the &s;pring ha&s;tily, for a gla&s;s of cool water; and mi&s;taking her complexion, in the dark, &s;he
<PB N="76" REF="028332_0073_0FD8859AA7D81A90">
was taken &s;on the prothonotary, making his e&s;cape in the di&s;|gui&s;e of a night cap. She was pur&s;ued; and &s;uppo&s;ing her&s;elf obnoxious, &s;he left the gla&s;s, and took to the woods. It was thought that the prothonotary had e&s;caped, and the re&s;entment fell on the attorney, for harbouring a criminal; and it was with great difficulty, and not until the mulatto woman, recovering her&s;elf, had come back, that he could convince them of the truth.</P>
<P>Edward Day had taken the &s;afe&s;t route, and de&s;cended the river to fort Wa&s;hington.</P>
<P>The in&s;pection offices, through the whole &s;urvey, compre|hending five counties, had, at this time, been burned down, with the dwelling hou&s;es of the deputies. Liberty poles, with in&s;criptions and devices, rai&s;ed every where. In&s;criptions, &s;uch as, "an equal tax, and no exci&s;e;" devices, &s;uch as a &s;nake divided, with this motto, "united we &s;tand, divided we fall." I met with no man that &s;eemed to have an idea, that we were to &s;eparate from the government, or to overthrow it, but &s;im|ply to oppo&s;e the exci&s;e law; and yet the people acted and &s;poke as if we were in a &s;tate of revolution. They threatened life and property familiarly. They talked of not &s;uffering Alexan|der Addi&s;on, the di&s;trict judge, to return to the country. He was, at that time, at Philadelphia, A report, that, on his way down, he had met the mar&s;hal, and encouraged him to come forward with his writs, had rendered him obnoxious. They proceeded to acts of violence among them&s;elves; every man a|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="6 letters">g his own injury.

<P>The mo&s;t deli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">te conduct was nece&s;&s;ary, in order to avoid giving offence.

<P>In the mean time, a kind of temporary block-hou&s;e was con|&s;tructed in the middle of the garri&s;on to defend the curtain on the &s;outh, of which I have before made mention, and exer|tions were made to furni&s;h the garri&s;on with two months pro|vi&s;ions. Application was made to a per&s;on, concerned in bu&s;|cuit baking in the town, to &s;ell the public the bu&s;cuit he had on hand. He con&s;ulted me, apprehen&s;ive that it might not be &s;afe, as the country might hear of it, and make him the object of re&s;entment. I thought they could not take offence at his di&s;po&s;ing of what was in the way of bu&s;ine&s;s; but that, to &s;ave appearances, it might be well to let the public barge come round and take it from him. I mention this to &s;hew the delica|cy of the apprehen&s;ions of individuals.</P>

put up, and kept ready to be removed to the garri&s;on, at the &s;horte&s;t notice, if the town &s;hould have any rea&s;on to apprehend any thing from another movement.</P>
<P>As to my&s;elf, I canva&s;&s;ed my &s;ituation fully, and begun more &s;eriou&s;ly to think of emigration; but in that ca&s;e, I would be con&s;idered in the light of a de&s;erter, and my property become a &s;acrifice. I thought of di&s;po&s;ing of my hou&s;e, which was peri&s;hable, to &s;ome individual le&s;s con&s;picuous, and under his name &s;ave it. But that would be &s;u&s;pected or di&s;covered. I thought of being ab&s;ent on &s;ome pretence that might be plau&s;|ible; and it &s;truck me to prevail with the people of Pitt&s;burgh to appoint me as an envoy to the executive, to &s;tate the motives of their conduct, and explain their &s;ituation. I mentioned this to James Ro&s;s, who approved of it, and at my reque&s;t, to &s;ound General Wilkins, to get him to favour it. Mr. Ro&s;s did &s;o, but informed me that General Wilkins was not willing that I &s;hould leave the town. He was in the &s;ame &s;ituation him&s;elf, and did not like to lo&s;e company. I have learned &s;ince, that there were more in the &s;ame &s;ituation, and with the &s;ame reflections, el&s;ewhere, who had planned the getting out of the country, by pretending to go below, to purcha&s;e powder. Sub&s;criptions were opened in reality, in places, for the &s;ending below for arms and ammunition.</P>
<P>I made up my mind now to wait the re&s;ult of the meeting at Parkin&s;on's ferry. My object was, a pacification of the country, by means &s;hort of force. With a view to this, I wi&s;hed the government to have a ju&s;t idea of the &s;ituation of the country; the magnitude and extent of the oppo&s;ition. In that ca&s;e, the executive might be di&s;po&s;ed to adopt conciliatory mea&s;ures. On this principle, having received a packet, containing &s;ome papers, from Tench Coxe of Philadelphia, on agricultural &s;ubjects, to be communicated to the people of this country, it &s;truck me, to communicate to the government, by writing to him, my im|pre&s;&s;ions, with regard to the di&s;turbance. This letter was mi&s;|under&s;tood, and con&s;idered as proof that I was engaged in the in&s;urrection. Some expre&s;&s;ions led to this mi&s;conception, which I had u&s;ed to &s;ave my&s;elf with the more violent of the people of the country, if it &s;hould fall into their hands, by the inter|cepting the mail; a thing con&s;tantly expected. In writing to Tench Coxe, I con&s;idered my&s;elf as writing to the government, under&s;tanding him to be in an official &s;ituation near the Pre&s;i|dent.</P>

<P>And I do declare, upon my &s;olemn word, that, if &s;uch delinquents do not come forth, on the next alarm, in equipments, and give their a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance, as in them lies, in oppo&s;ing the execution, and obtaining a repeal, of the exci&s;e law, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e, or they, will be deemed as enemies, and &s;tand|ing oppo&s;ed to the virtuous principles of republican liberty, and &s;hall re|ceive puni&s;hment according to the nature of the offence; and that, at lea&s;t, con&s;umption of his di&s;tillery.</P>

</TEXT></Q></NOTE>. In the march from Braddock's fields, the acclamation was, Huzza for Tom the Tinker. It was not now, Are you whig or tory? but, Are you a Tom the Tinker's man? Every man was willing to be thought &s;o; and &s;ome had a great deal of trouble to wipe off imputations to the contrary. Adverti&s;ements appeared in the gazettes, from individuals, appealing to the public, and avering the fal&s;hood of a&s;per&s;ions upon them, as &s;avouring the exci&s;e law.</P>
<P>It having been announced to Gib&s;on and Neville, that, by our undertaking, in their behalf, with the committee of batta|lions on Braddock's fields, they were to leave the town in ten days, I received a note from Neville, addre&s;&s;ed to me, as chair|man of the committee of 21, demanding a pa&s;&s;port from the country, and an e&s;cort. I di&s;covered a &s;ymptom of ill humour,
<PB N="80" REF="028332_0077_0FD8859DA6B70E78">
in addre&s;&s;ing me as chairman; for he knew it had never been my place to be chairman, but to be among&s;t tho&s;e that addre&s;|&s;ed the chair. I was the more di&s;po&s;ed to con&s;true it in this manner, having found him, in a conver&s;ation the day before, in an irritated &s;tate of mind, with regard to the part that had been taken by me and others, in his expul&s;ion. His expre&s;&s;ion was, that he under&s;tood "it was the members from Pitt&s;burgh that in&s;i&s;ted on his expul&s;ion." It might have been &s;o repre&s;ented to him; and his informants may have mi&s;conceived our conduct.</P>
<P>I was hurt with the&s;e &s;u&s;picions, and the unrea&s;onable di&s;&s;at|faction with me per&s;onally. Neverthele&s;s, con&s;idering the circum|&s;tances, I was determined to maintain a perfect apathy to all im|pre&s;&s;ions of re&s;entment, and go on to render him every &s;ervice in my power. Having taken the trouble to go round, and col|lect the committee; pa&s;&s;ports were made for him and Gib&s;on: double pa&s;&s;ports for each: one in a few words, to &s;erve them to pa&s;s through the country; and couched for them, as for pri&s;on|ers under a guard. I have not a copy of it.</P>
<P>Another, and the principal one, was a &s;tatement of the ground of expul&s;ion: that it might be &s;een below, and manife&s;t the futility of the charges again&s;t them. The idea of this was &s;ugge&s;ted by me, and the pa&s;&s;port dictated to the &s;ecretary. It was afterwards publi&s;hed in the gazettes of Philadelphia. I &s;ub|join a copy in a note <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><LETTER>
<P>At a meeting of the committee of 21 of the town of Pitt&s;burgh, Augu&s;t 4, report was made to them by the committee, who were a part of the com|mittee of battalions, on Braddock's fields, viz. that in the committee on Braddock's fields, it was &s;tated on the part of the committee of four, that the three per&s;ons pro&s;cribed; of the town of Pitt&s;burgh, viz. Abraham Kirk|patrick, James Bri&s;on, and Edward Day, were expelled the town, and had di&s;appeared.</P>
<P>It was then taken into view what other per&s;ons were obnoxious, as be|ing &s;u&s;pected of being friendly to the exci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e law; as might appear by let|ters, or otherwi&s;e; and on certain letters being read, which had been in|tercepted in the mail, from Pitt&s;burgh to Philadelphia; viz. one from col|onel Pre&s;ley Neville, to his father in-law, contains in a certain paragraph, words unfavourable to the oppo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> of the exci&s;e law, though no per&s;on in particular was named; but this being con&s;idered as a &s;ufficient evidence of his enmity to the cau&s;e, it was re&s;olved that he &s;hould be expelled the country within ten days.</P>
<P>Al&s;o another letter from general John Gib&s;on to the governor of Penn|&s;ylvania, which, in a certain paragraph, evinces a like di&s;po&s;ition, by a mi&s;tate|ment made by him, on information, which information was not thought to be exact, and which he had too ha&s;tily credited, it was re&s;olved that he &s;hould be &s;ubject to the like &s;entence, and that the committee of Pitt&s;burgh &s;hould carry into effect the&s;e mea&s;ures nece&s;&s;ary to the public &s;afety.</P>
<P>Re&s;olved, therefore, That notice of their re&s;pective &s;entences be forthwith given to tho&s;e per&s;ons, and that they depart accordingly; and that a guard be ordered for each of them, to conduct them to a proper di&s;tance.</P>

</LETTER></NOTE>.</P>
<P>Agreeable to our re&s;olves, prior to the meeting at Braddock's fields, delegates were to be elected to the meeting at Parkin|&s;on's ferry.</P>
<P>Circum&s;tances were &s;o materially changed, from what they were at the time of the Mingo creek meeting, that I had de|clined all idea of going forward as a delegate; and gave it to be known in the town, that in the appointment, I would not
<PB N="81" REF="028332_0078_0FD89A5B7488F598">
chu&s;e to have my name mentioned. There appeared to me but little pro&s;pect, that the meeting &s;hould re&s;t &s;hort of deliberate and &s;y&s;tematic ho&s;tility. I had heard of the language of Brad|ford, after his return to Wa&s;hington, from the march to Pitt&s;|burgh. "A glorious revolution accompli&s;hed without blood|&s;hed." I conceived from thence, that he mu&s;t have an idea of &s;upporting<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> at all hazards, what had been done. My impre&s;|&s;ion of Mar&s;hall, from what I had heard, from others, and what I had &s;een of his conduct, was, that he had incon&s;iderate|ly involved him&s;elf in the bu&s;ine&s;s, but would be happy to get out&punc; if he could. But I knew the people would not let him; he would not dare to talk of any thing, but going on to war; and &s;uch was his &s;ituation, from his per&s;onal acts, that it had be|come as much his policy, as any man's, to meditate defence.</P>
<P>On the&s;e principles, I thought it mo&s;t advi&s;eable to &s;end to that meeting &s;ome per&s;ons, who would not be under the nece&s;|&s;ity of acting a con&s;picuous part, by being called upon to &s;peak, not being &s;uppo&s;ed in the habit of it, as I profe&s;&s;ionally was. That in &s;hort, to &s;ave appearances, it was advi&s;eable to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">end &s;ome per&s;ons; but, at the &s;ame time, &s;uch per&s;ons as could have it in their power to remain ob&s;cure.</P>
<P>James Ro&s;s and general Wilkins, to whom I communicated the&s;e ideas, were of a contrary opinion, and thought it advi&s;e|able to go forward; and, at the &s;ame time, to u&s;e endeavours to get forwards, from all parts of the country, delegates, op|po&s;ed to violent mea&s;ures. I yielded to their opinion; and gave it to be under&s;tood, that I was willing to go to the meet|ing, if I &s;hould be cho&s;en.</P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="028332_0079_0FD89A5CF0FD7D18">General Wilkins and others, in the town and adjoining coun|try, were active in getting forward per&s;ons in the county of All<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">gheny, of the de&s;cription before &s;ugge&s;ted. James Ro&s;s had gone to Wa&s;hington, with the &s;ame views.</P>
<P>The election for delegates to the meeting took place, with &s;ome form&punc; in Pitt&s;burgh, and under the appearance of being warm in the cau&s;e of Tom the Tinker. John Wilkins, &s;enior, was made a judge of the election; and being a man of humour, with great gravity, made it a te&s;t of the right of &s;uffrage, the being for Tom the Tinker; and affected to &s;cruple the votes of &s;ome, who, not perceiving the burle&s;que, he&s;itated to &s;ay they were for Tom. When I came in, to give my vote, &s;aid Wil|kins, I need not a&s;k any te&s;t from you, for you are Tom the Tinker him&s;elf; meaning, that I had acted his part, in the af|fair of Braddock's fields, in the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed manner. The whole of this was under&s;tood to be a je&s;t: neverthele&s;s, affida|vits of this plea&s;antry of Wilkins, in the ca&s;e of the te&s;t, were carried to the executive; and he was afterwards alarmed a|bout it.</P>
<P>I was cho&s;en a delegate, with general Wilkins and others. The fir&s;t great object to be accompli&s;hed by that meeting, was, the taking the bu&s;ine&s;s out of the hands of the multitude, by e|&s;tabli&s;hing an organi&s;ation, through which alone they could act: Fir&s;t, re&s;olving it to be the &s;en&s;e of the committee, that the &s;tate laws were in force; and that the authority of all civil officers was to be re&s;pected&punc; and no violence to be done by any man, on his mere motion, under pain of being denounced by the com|mittee, as an enemy to his country.</P>
<P>For it will be under&s;tood, that the idea of a committee had become more formidable than that of a court. It was a new authority, &s;pringing fre&s;h from the people's power, and had the force of opinion on its &s;ide. The mulct of a court, for a breach of the peace, would affect the property; but the cen&s;ure of a committee, would render a man infamous.</P>
<P>Secondly, re&s;olving, that the meeting addre&s;s the Pre&s;ident; &s;tating what had taken place, and praying a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of force again&s;t the country, and an oblivion of what had taken place; under &s;uch arrangements as might be obtainable.</P>
<P>Thirdly, re&s;olving, that a &s;tanding committee of &s;afety be appointed, to be con&s;ervators of the peace, in &s;upport of the civil authority; and to be the organ of negociation with the ex|ecutive, on the &s;ubject of an amne&s;ty, and the arrangements that might be obtainable.</P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="028332_0080_0FD89A5E8992E998">Fourthly, re&s;olving, that the meeting publi&s;h an addre&s;s to the people, explaining what had been done, and their views in doing it; and enjoining an obedience to all the municipal laws<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It was nece&s;&s;ary to u&s;e this plea, to avoid the odium of including the exci&s;e law.</NOTE>, during the pendency of the negociation with the government.</P>
<P>Agreeable to the &s;cheme of the&s;e re&s;olves, I had drawn up an addre&s;s to the Pre&s;ident, and another to the people, on the principle &s;tated, and had them prepared to be laid before the meeting.</P>
<P>General Gib&s;on, at this time, or before it, had left the coun|try. Colonel Neville was about to go; but had &s;ome reluctance. It &s;truck me with &s;urpri&s;e: I had been thinking how to get a|way, and he had been thinking how to &s;tay. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;aw things from two different points of view.</P>
<P>He came to me after the delegation to Parkin&s;on's ferry, and expre&s;&s;ed an idea, that he had a right to expect of me, and o|thers delegated from the town, that, at the meeting, we &s;hould go forward, and demand an examination of his ca&s;e, and a re|peal of the &s;entence of the committee of battalions, on Brad|dock's fields; that he had a right to expect this, in as much as it was on the account of the town, that the &s;entence was to be carried into effect.</P>
<P>I was hurt at his want of a ju&s;t conception of the ca&s;e, in &s;up|po&s;ing, that it was on account of the town, that he was to go away. It was on account of him, and others, that the town had been in danger; and it was for his own &s;ake, that he was to go away. I had con&s;idered him as con&s;igning his ca&s;e to my management, from what he had &s;aid to me, the morning I went to Braddock's fields; and I never managed the ca&s;e of a client, at the bar, with more fidelity, than I did his, on this occa&s;ion. I had thought the bu&s;ine&s;s well managed, in diverting an enfu|riated mob from coming in to &s;eize him, and others: and this was accompli&s;hed, by the policy of getting the mob to conden&s;e them&s;elves into a committee; and then managing that commit|tee, to adopt the mild re&s;olution of leaving him in the hands of the committee of Pitt&s;burgh, as guardians, in fact, of his &s;afety, though nominally the executors of the &s;entence.</P>
<P>I do not mean to blame him, or others, for writing by the mail, or for what they wrote; but I &s;tate the writing as the occa&s;ion of the cavalcade, and our di&s;turbance.</P>
<P>I &s;tated this candidly to Neville; and perhaps, in a more
<PB N="84" REF="028332_0081_0FD89A637A3D1A78">
pointed manner, than I would otherwi&s;e have done, had not my feelings been hurt, by his &s;u&s;picions which had been &s;ug|ge&s;ted to me.</P>
<P>But I farther ob&s;erved to him, that, &s;uppo&s;ing it demandable of the town, to go forward, and propo&s;e the recalling him; was it practicable? did he not know, that he was con&s;idered by the people, as the in&s;pector him&s;elf? what the father got, the &s;on had.

<P>I am not about to que&s;tion the truth of the lo&s;s, nor the pro|priety of adverti&s;ing. I only &s;peak of the effect on the minds of the people, who may be offended with the imputation; and, in|fact, they are offended. They know your father had gone, be|fore the appearance of the adverti&s;ement; and you are &s;uppo&s;ed to have written it: and though they admit the lo&s;s may have taken place by the burning, they re&s;ent the being thought ca|pable of theft or forgery.</P>
<P>In your letter to the Mingo meeting, you gave offence: they thought your ca&s;ui&s;try, prevarication; and Kirkpatrick's intre|pidity, of which you &s;poke, they thought &s;tupidity.

I have heard that he has men|tioned it as a proof; and that he re&s;ents a declaration made by me, at the time, that, if I was to advocate the ca&s;e of any per|&s;on, it would be that of judge Addi&s;on; who, it &s;eems, had become obnoxious. I am not capable of the indelicacy of wound|ing the &s;elf-love of any man, by a per&s;onal preference of ano|ther, to his face; but I gave this as a proof, that, even in a ca&s;e where my own intere&s;t was materially concerned, as the having the pre&s;ident of the court in the circuit, without whom the bu&s;ine&s;s of my profe&s;&s;ion mu&s;t, in a great degree, be at a &s;tand, I would not think it expedient to go forward, and men|tion his name. By that direct mode of acting, I could not bring him back; and I would put my&s;elf away. I had in view, to &s;ave the influence that I happened to po&s;&s;e&s;s, in order that the people might let me work with them, in con&s;tructing the wheel, the revolution of which, would &s;et all matters right, and bring Alexander Addi&s;on and Pre&s;ly Neville into their places again.</P>
<P>The fact is, there was a great proportion of tho&s;e at the burning of the hou&s;e, capable of all that was alleged; but the bulk of the leaders, were them&s;elves led by fal&s;e ideas of pa|trioti&s;m, and though guilty of a great offence, at the moment, would have &s;hrunk from the violation of moral truth, or the commi&s;&s;ion of di&s;hone&s;ty. I write this, not to make their a|pology, but to explain human nature.</P>
<P>I had frequently heard it &s;aid, by the people of the country, &s;ince the introduction of the exci&s;e law, that it were better for them to be under the Briti&s;h; and at this time, &s;uch language began to be very common. But I cannot &s;ay, that I ever heard any per&s;on of note breathe the idea. It was &s;aid, that arms and ammunition could be obtained from the Briti&s;h.</P>
<P>At this time, reports from the ea&s;t of the mountains were, that the people on that &s;ide, were as violent as tho&s;e on this; that they had proceeded to outrages. This was alarming. I &s;aw before me, the anarchy of a period; a &s;hock to the govern|ment; and po&s;&s;ibly a revolution,&mdash;a revolution impregnated with the Jacobin principles of France, and which might become equally bloody to the principal actors. It would be bloody unavoidably to them; and to the people, de&s;tructive. Let no man &s;uppo&s;e, that I coveted a revolution. I had &s;een the evils of one already, the American; and I had read the evils of an|other, the French. My imagination pre&s;ented the evils of the

la&s;t &s;o &s;trongly to my view, and brought them &s;o clo&s;e to a probable experience at home, that, during the whole period of the in&s;urrection, I could &s;carcely bear to ca&s;t my eye upon a paragraph of French news. This is not a &s;tatement of &s;enti|ment, invented now; they were my expre&s;&s;ions at the time. It was not the exci&s;e law, alone, that was the object with the people; it was, with many, not the principal object. A man, of &s;ome note, and who&s;e family had been at the burning of Ne|ville's hou&s;e, was &s;een on hor&s;eback, in Pitt&s;burgh, the day of Braddock's field, riding along with a tomahawk in his hand, and rai&s;ed over his head&mdash;"This is not all that I want: it is not the exci&s;e law only, that mu&s;t go down; your di&s;trict and a&s;|&s;ociate judges mu&s;t go down; your high offices and &s;alaries. A great deal more is to be done; I am but beginning yet."</P>
<P>In the appointment of a&s;&s;ociate judges, there were great di&s;|appointments among individuals; and the ju&s;tices of the peace, many of them, wi&s;hed to be again upon the bench.</P>
<P>I &s;aw the cour&s;e of things; that there would be no occa&s;ion for a lawyer for a while; and on a retro&s;pective view, I had conceived &s;uch a dete&s;tation of pleading before ju&s;tices of the peace, that, if that order of things &s;hould once more take place, I would never plead at all. Of all things that I ever met with in life, it was the greate&s;t ab&s;urdity, to be appealing to men, as judges of principles, the knowledge of which requires a &s;tudy and practice of twenty years; to men, de&s;titute of a knowledge of a &s;ingle element of the &s;cience. I had con&s;idered the con&s;ti|tution of the courts of Penn&s;ylvania, as a great acqui&s;ition, and was unwilling that it &s;hould be di&s;turbed: but, as a proof that reforms of this nature were meditated, let me &s;tate, that, far before this time, repre&s;entations to the legi&s;lature, had been circulated in the country, and &s;ub&s;cribed; praying a reduction of &s;alaries of judges, and a rein&s;tatement of ju&s;tices of the peace upon the bench. A committee, in&s;tituted a year before, at Mingo creek, and which was the cradle of the in&s;urrection, went further; and propo&s;ed &s;u&s;pending the courts and the ju&s;tices of the peace altogether; and actually drew cau&s;es to their own ex|amination, and exerci&s;ed judiciary authority. Benjamin Par|kin&s;on was pre&s;ident of that committee.</P>
<P>There was an accidental circum&s;tance, which, independen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of fixed and permanent cau&s;es, in the minds of the people, contri|buted to the inflammation of this period.

<HEAD>CHAP. X.</HEAD>
<P>IN the morning of the meeting at Parkin&s;on's ferry, I &s;aw James Mar&s;hall; and in order to reconcile him&s;elf with his feel|ings, and di&s;po&s;e him favourably towards me, I ob&s;erved, that the calling out the people to Braddock's fields, was a ra&s;h act; but it might have a good effect. It would impre&s;s the govern|ment with a fear of the extent of the oppo&s;ition to the law. He &s;eemed plea&s;ed with the apology made for it, and ob&s;erved, "that Bradford was ha&s;ty in undertaking things, and had not abilities afterwards to manage them." I con&s;idered this as an apology to me, for the ra&s;hne&s;s of what had been done.</P>
<P>But I found that he contemplated the going on to &s;upport, by force of arms, what had been done. He &s;hewed me a &s;et of re&s;olutions, which he had drawn up, to lay before the m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">|ing; one of which contemplated force again&s;t the government. He gave me to under&s;tand, that Bradford al&s;o, had made a mi|nute of &s;ome things that he meant to move. Bradford here joined us, and I &s;aw his &s;chedule. It contained the heads of particulars, that would be the &s;ubject of con&s;ideration. A com|mittee of &s;afety, magazines, arms, ammunition, clothing, pro|vi&s;ions, &amp;c.</P>
<P>There were two or three of the re&s;olutions of Mar&s;hall, in &s;ub&s;tance, the &s;ame with tho&s;e I had devi&s;ed in my mind, and I approved of them. I developed my plan of &s;ending commi&s;|&s;ioners to the executive, and &s;hewed the addre&s;s I had drawn up to be pre&s;ented to him. They approved of it.</P>
<P>In order to retain the management of Bradford, it was my policy, at that period, to conceal from him my total di&s;appro|bation of what had been done. I &s;aid not a word with re&s;pect
<PB N="88" REF="028332_0085_0FD89A6B30C496B0">
to it; nor did I venture to oppo&s;e, on the &s;ubject of making war; but to keep him from thinking, and coming to a clo&s;e con|ver&s;ation, I amu&s;ed him with plea&s;antry, and kept him laugh|ing. I made u&s;e of major Craig for this purpo&s;e, and encored the &s;tory of the big guns, to be drawn out of Braddock's ford&punc; and that of taking down the in&s;cription of the in&s;pection office, as related to me by captain Lang.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t before the opening of the meeting, Bradford came <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> me, and put it upon me to introduce the bu&s;ine&s;s, by giving a hi&s;tory of what had taken place, &s;ince the meeting at Ming<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> creek; and offered me the letters which had been intercepted in the mail, to read to the people. I declined it, by ob&s;erving, that his acquaintance with the &s;ubject was more than mine; and that the &s;edate dignified narrative, was more his talent than mine. And be&s;ides, there had been people expelled from Pitt&s;|burgh, on account of tho&s;e letters; and living in the &s;ame vil|lage with the connections and families of the&s;e, it was a ca&s;e of greater delicacy with me, than it could be with him, to explain the propriety of their expul&s;ion, or read the letters.</P>
<P>The meeting was opened, by placing Edward Cook in the chair, and making Albert Gallatin &s;ecretary. The credentials of our election were produced; and there appeared to be mem|bers from Ohio county, in Virginia, and five counties of Penn|&s;ylvania. In the whole, there were 260. Our hall was a grove; and we might well be called the Mountain, for we were on a very lofty ground, overlooking the river. We had a gallery of lying timber and &s;tumps; and there were more people col|lected there, than there was of the committee.</P>
<P>Bradford opened the meeting, by giving &s;ome deduction of who had taken place;&mdash;the appearance of the mar&s;hal to &s;erve his writs, the attack on Neville's hou&s;e, the flight of the in&s;pector, the expul&s;ion of other obnoxious characters, &amp;c. Here he read the letters intercepted in the mail.</P>
<P>Mar&s;hall now brought forward his propo&s;itions:</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, That taking citizens of the United States, from their re&s;pective abodes, or vicinage, to be tried, for real or &s;uppo&s;ed offenoes, is a violation of the rights of the citizens, is a forced and dangerous con&s;truction of the con&s;titution, and ought not to be exerci&s;ed by the judicial authority.</P>
<P>It was alleged by Mar&s;hall, that the language of this re&s;olve, as of the others, might not be correct, or the idea well expre&s;|&s;ed; and he wi&s;hed the &s;ecretary to frame it as might &s;eem pro|per. I &s;poke on this occa&s;ion: and ob&s;erved, that, by the con|&s;titution,
<PB N="89" REF="028332_0086_0FD89A7018FB85E8">
the whole &s;tate was made the vicinage <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q><TEXT>

</DIV1>
</BODY>
</TEXT></Q></NOTE>; and the ju|diciary had it in their power, to make u&s;e of it to that extent. Neverthele&s;s, it certainly was an abridgment of that advantage which the citizens had before the con&s;titution exi&s;ted, where the vicinage was the county; and that it was a hard con&s;truc|tion of the con&s;titution, to &s;uppo&s;e, that it contemplated &s;uch a judiciary &s;y&s;tem, as would bring citizens from one end of the &s;tate to the other. For that rea&s;on, I approved of the &s;ub&s;tance of the re&s;olution; but as probably it might be improved in ex|pre&s;&s;ion, I propo&s;ed, that we &s;hould go over the re&s;olutions, and having agreed upon the &s;ub&s;tance, to refer them to a com|mittee of three, or more, to dige&s;t the arrangement, and ex|pre&s;s the &s;en&s;e, in the be&s;t manner, and lay them before the meeting for their final con&s;ideration. It was agreed, and we pa&s;&s;ed on the &s;econd re&s;olution, viz.</P>
<P>That a &s;tanding committee be appointed, to con&s;i&s;t of  <GAP DESC="blank">  members from each county, to be denominated, a Committee of Public Safety; who&s;e duty it &s;hall be, to call forth the re&s;ources of the we&s;tern country, to repel any ho&s;tile attempts, that may be made again&s;t the rights of the citizens, or of the body of the people.</P>
<P>Comparing this re&s;olution with the fir&s;t, I &s;aw that Mar&s;hall had conceived, that the act of the di&s;trict officer, in &s;erving writs in this country, to an&s;wer at Philadelphia, was illegal and void, and that it might be con&s;titutionally re&s;i&s;ted; and al&s;o, that an attempt of the government to enforce &s;uch an act, by pur&s;uing tho&s;e that had re&s;i&s;ted, might be con&s;titutionally op|po&s;ed; on the &s;ame principle that the money tax, and the force of government in aid of it, was con&s;titutionally oppo&s;ed by Hamden; or the declaratory act, and the enforcing of it, was oppo&s;ed by America again&s;t Britain. Coupling, therefore, the&s;e re&s;olutions, they would &s;eem to contemplate the re&s;i&s;ting the authority of the officer of the di&s;trict, and protecting, by arms, tho&s;e who had re&s;i&s;ted him. Taking the words by them&s;elves, they were not exceptionable: for, doubtle&s;s the people retain the right to repel ho&s;tile attempts again&s;t their rights; on the &s;ame principle that I may repel the officer, who would &s;eize me without proce&s;s. But coupling the words with the preced|ing re&s;olution, and with the acts perpetrated in the country, and
<PB N="90" REF="028332_0087_0FD89A72BAA68E90">
with the &s;tate of it, they appeared to me exceptionable. The<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e were my reflections, from the time I had read the re&s;olutions, in the morning, until that time.</P>
<P>The re&s;olution being read, &s;ecretary Gallatin ro&s;e:&mdash;What rea&s;on, &s;aid he, have we to &s;uppo&s;e, that ho&s;tile attempts will be made again&s;t our rights? and why, therefore, prepare to re&s;i&s;t them? Riots have taken place, which may be the &s;ubject of judiciary cognizance; but we are not to &s;uppo&s;e a military force, on the part of the government.</P>
<P>If I am not accurate in &s;tating this language, or the&s;e ideas of the &s;ecretary, it ought to be attributed to defect of memory, not de&s;ign. It was my impre&s;&s;ion, at the time, either that it was the only pretence that occurred to him to u&s;e, to wave the re&s;olution, or that actually he did not know, that the acts com|mitted brought it within the power of the Pre&s;ident to order out the militia.</P>
<P>I &s;aw the principle, and re&s;pected the courage of the &s;ecreta|ry, in meeting the re&s;olution; but I knew that it was a favour|ite one, with all tho&s;e that had been involved in any of the out|rages, and, at the &s;ame time, a popular one generally. I was alarmed, therefore, at the idea of any di&s;cu&s;ion of it; and in|&s;tantly, before any one could have an opportunity of &s;peaking, I affected to oppo&s;e the &s;ecretary; and thought it might not be ami&s;s to have the re&s;olution; but it might be &s;oftened in terms, without altering the &s;ub&s;tance, and it might be &s;aid, the com|mittee &s;hould have power to take &s;uch mea&s;ures as the &s;ituation of affairs might require; and that the committee of four, to whom the modelling of the re&s;olutions was to be committed, might model the terms. Mar&s;hall acquie&s;ced, and there was no que&s;tion, or debate.</P>
<P>Third re&s;olution, That a committee of  <GAP DESC="blank">  members be ap|pointed, to draft a remon&s;trance to Congre&s;s; praying a repeal of the exci&s;e law, and that a more equal, and le&s;s odious tax, will be cheerfully paid by the people of the&s;e counties; and that the &s;ame remon&s;trance be &s;igned by the chairman of this meeting, in behalf of the people whom we repre&s;ent.</P>
<P>This re&s;olution was oppo&s;ed, on the principle, that it was u&s;ele&s;s to remon&s;trate to Congre&s;s; that body having treated with contempt, all former remon&s;trances on that &s;ubject. It was, however, carried; tho&s;e who had oppo&s;ed it, acquie&s;cing.</P>
<P>Fourth re&s;olution, Whereas the motives by which the peo|ple of the we&s;tern country have been actuated, in the late un|happy di&s;turbances, at Neville's hou&s;e, and in the great and
<PB N="91" REF="028332_0088_0FD89A7446D9EBE8">
general rendezvous at Braddock's fields, &amp;c. are liable to be mi&s;con&s;trued, as well by our fellow citizens, throughout the United States, as by their and our public &s;ervants, to whom is con&s;igned the admini&s;tration of the federal government, Re&s;olv|ed, That a committee be appointed, to make a fair and candid &s;tatement of the whole tran&s;action, to the Pre&s;ident of the U|nited States, and to the governments of Penn&s;ylvania and Vir|ginia; and, if it &s;hould become nece&s;&s;ary, that the &s;aid com|mittee do publi&s;h to the world, a manife&s;to or declaration, whereby the true motives and principles of the people of this country, &s;hall be fairly and fully &s;tated.</P>
<P>This was committed, without debate, to the committee of four, to be modelled as to arrangement and expre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Fifth re&s;olution, That we will, with the re&s;t of our fellow citizens, &s;upport the laws and government of the re&s;pective &s;tates in which we live, and the government of the United States; the exci&s;e law, and the taking away citizens out of their re&s;pective counties, only excepted: and, therefore, we will aid and a&s;&s;i&s;t all civil officers, in the execution of their re&s;pective functions; and endeavour, by every proper means in our power, to bring to ju&s;tice all offenders in the premi&s;es.</P>
<P>On the con&s;ideration of this re&s;olution, the &s;tate of the coun|try, without law and &s;afety, to per&s;ons or property, was re|pre&s;ented, at &s;ome length, by me. Mr. Gallatin &s;upported the nece&s;&s;ity of the re&s;olution, with a view to the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the laws, and the con&s;ervation of the peace.</P>
<P>Though he did not venture to touch on the re&s;i&s;tance to the mar&s;hal, or the expul&s;ion of the pro&s;cribed, yet he &s;trongly ar|raigned the de&s;truction of property; the burning of the barn of Kirkpatrick, for in&s;tance. What! &s;aid a fiery fellow in the committee, do you blame that? The &s;ecretary found him&s;elf embarra&s;&s;ed; he pau&s;ed for a moment.&mdash;If you had burned him in it, &s;aid he, it might have been &s;omething; but the barn had done no harm. Ay, ay, &s;aid the man, that is right enough. I admired the pre&s;ence of mind of Gallatin; and give the inci|dent, as a proof of the delicacy nece&s;&s;ary to manage the people on that occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>A member of the committee, who had &s;een the &s;chedule of Bradford, moved that it &s;hould be brought forward. It was brought forward, and laid upon the table. Several per&s;ons &s;poke on the &s;ubject of con&s;tituting magazines of arms and am|munition; and &s;eemed to wi&s;h re&s;olutions pointedly to this, on the ground of Bradford's &s;chedule. Gallatin was labouring hard
<PB N="92" REF="028332_0089_0FD89A75C6F14C48">
to divert this, by attacking it in front. It did &s;eem to do: there was danger of &s;ome que&s;tion of this nature being taken. I had been out of the circle; but returned at this juncture. I affect|ed, as before, to oppo&s;e Gallatin; and made an apology for tho&s;e, who were for providing means of war.&mdash;Said I, it may not be ami&s;s to talk of the&s;e things, and to hold out the idea of fighting, with a view to avoid it; ju&s;t as a general di&s;plays co|lumns, meaning, by that di&s;play, to avoid engaging. The idea of our being about to fight, may induce government to ac|commodate with the country. But enough is done. The&s;e things will all be left to the direction of the &s;tanding committee.</P>
<P>The apology &s;aved the pride of the &s;peakers, and &s;atisfied the hopes of the violent; and there was no more &s;aid. I was thought to be for war, if it &s;hould be nece&s;&s;ary. I was applaud|ded by the gallery; and it was &s;aid, I had gained what I had lo&s;t at Mingo creek.</P>
<P>I had founded the public mind, before I came to the meet|ing, with regard to the recal of the prothonotary of Alleghe|ny county. He had left a young man in the office: neverthe|le&s;s, the ab&s;ence of the prothonotary him&s;elf, was a great in|convenience to the country, and to me, in my profe&s;&s;ion. I had &s;ounded the committee, &s;ince I had come, and made up my mind, that it was not advi&s;eable to introduce his name. A cir|cum&s;tance, independent of his letter writing, had made him ob|noxious.</P>
<P>While the &s;tate exci&s;e had been in force, writs had been i&s;|&s;ued from his office, again&s;t delinquent di&s;tillers; 70, or up|wards, to one term. The prothonotary was &s;uppo&s;ed to have had &s;ome concern in the matter, for the &s;ake of his fees. Be|&s;ides, by purcha&s;ing claims in litigated ca&s;es, he had acquired the reputation of a &s;peculating prothonotary.</P>
<P>However, per&s;ons of his acquaintance, members of the com|mittee from Allegheny, were anxious to make trial of having him recalled; and one of them, George Wallace, a judge of the court, &s;olicited me to &s;peak to Bradford, to prevail with him not to oppo&s;e the motion. I did &s;o; and made u&s;e of the addre&s;s which my judgment &s;ugge&s;ted.&mdash;There is no que&s;tion, &s;aid I, but this prothonotary has acted with great impertinence, in writing to the government, and introducing your name; and the coxcomb de&s;erves what he has got, for his pains. Neverthe|le&s;s, it is an injury to the country, and to my&s;elf, that the pro|thonotary &s;hould be ab&s;ent; let us recal him for the pre&s;ent, and have him removed in due time. I know there is a difficulty
<PB N="93" REF="028332_0090_0FD89A772DA7FD00">
in the way, from the prejudices of others again&s;t him, on ac|count of his &s;peculations, and the affair of the 70 writs; &s;ome of the di&s;tillers, again&s;t whom they were i&s;&s;ued, being now of the committee; but, if you do not oppo&s;e the motion, proba|bly it may be carried. He &s;aid, he would not oppo&s;e it; but the people had thought they had done &s;omething, by going to Braddock's fields, and if it was undone, they would be di&s;&s;atis|fied.</P>
<P>I related this an&s;wer of Bradford to judge Wallace; and al&s;o &s;aid, I would &s;upport the motion, provided he could get &s;ome per&s;on to make it. He could get no one.</P>
<P>My introducing the idea of difficulty from others, in the ca&s;e of Bri&s;on, was a &s;troke of art. It was as much as to &s;ay, I know you care very little about it, whether he comes or &s;tays; but there will be objections from the&s;e people. This was intere&s;t|ing him with me, to overcome the objections; at lea&s;t, to with|draw his own. It had the effect.</P>
<P>The committee adjourned to the next day. The committee of four, who were to model the re&s;olutions, were to meet ear|ly the next morning. This committee were, Gallatin, Brad|ford, Herman Hu&s;band, and my&s;elf.</P>
<P>I lay, that night, at a farm hou&s;e in the neighbourhood, with an hundred, or more, of the gallery or committee about me. The whole cry was, War. From the manner in which they had under&s;tood me, I was greatly popular with them. Stand by us, &s;aid they, and we will &s;tand by you.</P>
<P>I felt my &s;ituation, with extreme &s;en&s;ibility. I had an at|tachment to the people, becau&s;e they had an attachment to me: and I thought of the con&s;equence: What &s;uppo&s;e that, in the pro&s;ecution of the plan I have in view, arrangements cannot be made to &s;atisfy them, and that a war mu&s;t en&s;ue; what &s;hall I do? I am under no obligation of honour, to take a part in &s;up|porting them; for I have no way contributed to produce the di&s;turbance. And though, on principles of con&s;cience, it may be excu&s;eable in them to make war, for they think they are right; yet it would not be &s;o in me, for I think them wrong. But, on the &s;core of &s;elf-pre&s;ervation, and per&s;onal intere&s;t, what am I to do? It is a mi&s;erable thing to be an emigrant; there is a &s;ecret contempt attached to it, even with tho&s;e to whom you come. They re&s;pect more the valour, though they di&s;approve the principle, of tho&s;e that &s;tay at home. All I have in the world, is in this country. It is not in money; I cannot
<PB N="94" REF="028332_0091_0FD8859F26CB4258">
carry it with me; and if I go abroad, I go poor: and I am too far advanced in life, to begin the world altogether.</P>
<P>But as to the&s;e people; what chance have they? They may defend the pa&s;&s;es of the mountains; they are warlike, accu&s;tom|ed to the u&s;e of arms; capable of hunger and fatigue; and can lie in the water like badgers. They are enthu&s;ia&s;tic to mad|ne&s;s; and the effect of this is beyond calculation.</P>
<P>The people on the ea&s;t of the mountains are, many of them, di&s;&s;atisfied, on the &s;ame principle; and will be little di&s;po&s;ed to di&s;turb the people here, if they &s;hould mean to defend them|&s;elves. It is true, the con&s;equence of war, &s;uppo&s;ing the coun|try independent of the United States, will be poverty, and a mi&s;erable &s;tate of things, for a long time; but &s;till, tho&s;e who &s;tand by the country, where they are, have the be&s;t chance, and the mo&s;t credit in the end. Should I emigrate, and the coun|try be reduced, I cannot live in it again, for a thou&s;and rea|&s;ons. I am in a quandary; and in either ca&s;e, the election is painful. The only thing that can &s;uit me, is an accommodation, and having the matter &s;ettled without a civil war. But is there any pro&s;pect of this? Will the executive be di&s;po&s;ed to act with mildne&s;s, or rigour, in this in&s;tance? The exci&s;e law is a branch of the funding &s;y&s;tem, which is a child of the &s;ecretary of the trea|&s;ury; who is con&s;idered as the mini&s;ter of the Pre&s;ident. He will feel a per&s;onal antipathy again&s;t the oppo&s;ers of it; and will be inclined to &s;anguinary coun&s;els. The Pre&s;ident him&s;elf, will con&s;ider it, as a more dangerous ca&s;e than the Indian war, or the Briti&s;h &s;poilations; and will be di&s;po&s;ed to apply more de&s;perate remedies. He will &s;ee, that here the vitals are af|fected; whereas there, the attack was upon the extremities. Neverthele&s;s, the extreme reluctance which he mu&s;t have, to &s;hed the blood of the people, with whom he is per&s;onally popu|lar, will di&s;po&s;e him to overtures of amne&s;ty.&mdash;The&s;e were my reveries, as I lay with my head upon a &s;addle, on the floor|ing of a cabin.</P>
<P>In the morning, the committee of four having met, we pro|ceeded to the arranging and mending the re&s;olutions. Bradford was not &s;atisfied with the indefinite expre&s;&s;ion of the power giv|en to the &s;tanding committee, but wi&s;hed to have it in plain terms; probably with a view to get &s;omething to pa&s;s the com|mittee, that would involve all equally with him&s;elf, in the trea|&s;ons committed. I wi&s;hed to evade it; and endeavoured to di|vert his attention, by keeping him laughing. I di&s;pen&s;ed with Craig, on this occa&s;ion, and made u&s;e of Herman Hu&s;band. I
<PB N="95" REF="028332_0092_0FD89A7CDC3D4750">
endeavoured to amu&s;e Bradford with him, as a per&s;on would a boy, by playing with a bear.</P>
<P>I had heard of this extraordinary character, many years a|go, when a principal of the in&s;urgents, known by the name of Regulators, in North Carolina. I had &s;een him in the year 1778, when he was a member of the legi&s;lature of Penn&s;ylvania. I was pre&s;ent, when a Quaker lady was introduced, and preached before the hou&s;e. Herman, who was a divine, as well as a po|litician, thought her not orthodox, and wi&s;hed to controvert; but the hou&s;e, willing to avoid religious controver&s;ies, would not &s;uffer him.</P>
<P>I had vi&s;ited him, in the year 1780, at his re&s;idence, in the glades of the Allegheny mountain, on my way from Philadel|phia to Pitt&s;burgh. He had then ju&s;t fini&s;hed a commentary on a part of the prophet Ezekiel: it was the vi&s;ion of the temple; the walls, the gates, the &s;ea of gla&s;s, &amp;c. Logger-head divines, heretofore, had interpreted it of the New Jeru&s;alem; but he conceived it to apply to the we&s;tern country; and the walls were the mountains, the gates, the gaps in them, by which the roads came, and the &s;ea of gla&s;s, the lake on the we&s;t of us. I had no he&s;itation in &s;aying, that the commentary was analagous to the vi&s;ion. He was plea&s;ed; and &s;aid, I was the only per&s;on, except his wife, that he ever got to believe it. Thought I, your church is compo&s;ed, like many others, of the ignorant and the di&s;&s;embling.</P>
<P>It was to this topic I drew him at pre&s;ent, and wi&s;hed him to explain his reveries. But Bradford was too intent on getting the re&s;olution amended, to an explicit provi&s;ional declaration of war; he complained of my laughing, and wi&s;hed me to be &s;erious. Gallatin, not perceiving my drift, &s;aid, cynically, "He laughs all by him&s;elf." I let Bradford alone then, and he puz|zled the &s;ecretary enough, and obliged him to put in a &s;entence, to avoid a wor&s;e, viz. that in the la&s;t of the &s;econd re&s;olution, as it was brought in.</P>
<P>The re&s;olutions, as brought in, are as follows:</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. Re&s;olved, that taking the citizens of the United States from their re&s;pective abodes, or vicinage, to be tried, for real or &s;uppo&s;ed offences, is a violation of the rights of the citizens; is a forced and dangerous con&s;truction of the con&s;titution, and ought not, under any pretence whatever, to be exerci&s;ed by the judicial authority.</P>

<P>The fir&s;t re&s;olution was read, and adopted.</P>
<P>On reading the &s;econd, it was moved by me, to fill up the blank with the number two, and to change the word county to town&s;hip; &s;o that the &s;tanding committee &s;hould con&s;i&s;t of two deputies from each town&s;hip. My argument was, that a great object being to have them con&s;ervators of the peace, in aid of the civil authority, it was nece&s;&s;ary they &s;hould be numerous, and every where al&s;o, that by them the &s;tanding committee could the more readily di&s;&s;eminate their ideas and re&s;olutions among&s;t the body of the people.</P>
<P>There were per&s;ons who thought my object wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o have them &s;cattered, to prevent le&s;s promptitude of action, and the violent mea&s;ures which a &s;mall body, clo&s;e together, might &s;ud|denly effect. Perhaps they were right. The amendment was carried.</P>
<P>It was moved by me, to in&s;ert, before the words "to call together a meeting of the deputies," the&s;e words, "a meet|ing, <HI>either of a new repre&s;entation of the people,</HI> or of the depu|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&punc; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> here convened."</P>
<P>My argument was, that a frequent change of repre&s;entation was corre&s;pondent with democratic principles; but thy real rea|&s;on was, to have it in my power to be quit of the bu&s;ine&s;s, pro|vided I &s;aw no pro&s;pect of accommodation with the government, or &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion with the people. I was &s;econded in this, with a|vidity,
<PB N="97" REF="028332_0094_0FD885A52AC2C318">
by an a&s;&s;ociate judge of Wa&s;hington, James Edgar; and though I have not conver&s;ed with him, yet I will venture to &s;ay, it was upon the fame principle. The motion was &s;upported by a number, and I am per&s;uaded, from the &s;ame motives. It was carried.</P>
<P>An adjournment took place, to chu&s;e the &s;tanding committee; which was done by each town&s;hip for it&s;elf. I was one for the town&s;hip of Pitt&s;burgh.</P>
<P>The committee now met again. I had drafted the following re&s;olution, viz. "That  <GAP DESC="blank">  commi&s;&s;ioners be appointed to wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t on the Pre&s;ident of the United States, with the repre&s;entation of the people, and report to the &s;tanding committee the an&s;wer they may receive."</P>
<P>But it having been announced, in the cour&s;e of our &s;itting, that commi&s;&s;ioners, from the executive to us, had arrived in the country, I changed the re&s;olution to the following, viz. "That a committee, to con&s;i&s;t of  <GAP DESC="blank">  members of each county, be ap|pointed, to meet any commi&s;&s;ioners that have, or may be ap|pointed by the government; and to report the re&s;ult of this conference to the &s;tanding committee." It was carried; and the blanks filled up with "three" members.</P>
<P>There was a con&s;iderable oppo&s;ition to this. It was &s;aid, that, as the commi&s;&s;ioners were now in the country, and &s;aid to be but a day's journey di&s;tant, the committee could wait until their arrival, and hear their propo&s;itions, and determine them|&s;elves.</P>
<P>This was con&s;idered as extremely dangerous to the object in view. James Ro&s;s was pre&s;ent, and had ju&s;t received his ap|pointment, as a commi&s;&s;ioner from the executive; and thought that, from the temper of the committee, and that of the gallery, by which they would be influenced, it did not appear probable that any propo&s;itions the commi&s;&s;ioners could have it in their power to make, would be received. The bu&s;ine&s;s mu&s;t be more gradually broken, and brought by degrees, and with cool|ing time, before the people. It was, therefore a great object to carry the re&s;olution as it was.</P>
<P>In &s;upport of this, the inconvenience of &s;taying at the place was alleged; no accommodation for our&s;elves, or the commi&s;|&s;ioners: that it would take a long time for us to under&s;tand them, and them to under&s;tand us: that the negociation would con&s;i&s;t of conference and corre&s;pondence; that there was no convenience of writing at the place.</P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="028332_0095_0FD89A7F819EA088">The re&s;olution was carried, with con&s;iderable difficulty, that commi&s;&s;ioners &s;hould be appointed.</P>
<P>But it was moved, that the committee &s;hould wait where they were, or in the neighbourhood, until the commi&s;&s;ioners, appointed by them, &s;hould report to them.</P>
<P>This was thought dangerous, on the principle before &s;ugge&s;|ted. The report would come better, in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, to the &s;tanding committee; in chu&s;ing which, addre&s;s had been u&s;ed, to get the more rea&s;onable and moderate members; and that committee, being a &s;maller body, would be more ea&s;ily ma|naged.</P>
<P>The time the conference would take up, and the inconveni|ence of waiting on the ground, or in the neighbourhood, was urged; but &s;uch was the avidity of curio&s;ity, that they were anxious to remain. Gallatin had exerted him&s;elf very much in the&s;e debates, and on this la&s;t point e&s;pecially: others had &s;up|ported him, but &s;eemed to fail.</P>
<P>I was walking on the out&s;ide of the circle; commi&s;&s;ioner Ro&s;s came to me, and wi&s;hed me to &s;tep forward. I do not &s;ee that I can do any thing, &s;aid I; Gallatin, and others, have &s;aid all that is rea&s;onable in the ca&s;e, and yet have failed. You can do it, &s;aid Ro&s;s.</P>
<P>I then &s;tepped forward. Knowing that it was the impatience of curio&s;ity, that made them anxious to &s;tay, I ob&s;erved, that it was not probable the&s;e commi&s;&s;ioners had any thing of much con&s;equence to propo&s;e, the Pre&s;ident not having &s;een our re|pre&s;entation before they had &s;et out; and therefore though, on principles of common decency, it was proper to hear them, yet it was not worth while for the committee to wa&s;te their time waiting for them.</P>
<P>It was agreed, and the re&s;olution carried as it &s;tands.</P>
<P>It may be &s;aid, that it is from motives of vanity, that I in|troduce my&s;elf &s;o much in the&s;e tran&s;actions. No; it is from motives of &s;elf-defence. I am explaining my conduct. Might I not do this, without introducing my &s;peeches &s;o much? No; the&s;e &s;peeches have been mi&s;conceived, and mi&s;repre&s;ented; I am explaining the <HI>quo animo,</HI> or view with which they were made.</P>
<P>The in&s;truction movers now came forward. We mu&s;t be in|&s;tructed by the meeting. This was parried, by getting it to be ob&s;erved, and pre&s;&s;ed, that in&s;tructions could not be given, with regard to propo&s;itions, when it could not be known what tho&s;e propo&s;itions were.</P>
<P><PB N="99" REF="028332_0096_0FD89A80F35A4550">It was now moved, that the time of the meeting of the &s;tand|ing committee &s;hould be fixed. It was carried, that the &s;tand|ing committee &s;hould fix their time of meeting them&s;elves.</P>
<P>The committee adjourned without day.</P>
<P>The &s;tanding committee met, and fixed for their day of meet|ing the  <GAP DESC="blank">  of September; and the place, Brown&s;ville, on the Monongahela.</P>
<P>The commi&s;&s;ioners to confer with tho&s;e on the part of the United States, fixed the time the 20th of Augu&s;t, and the place Pitt&s;burgh.</P>
<P>Before my going to Parkin&s;on's ferry, an old man, of the name of Bar, from Mingo creek, calling at my office on bu&s;i|ne&s;s, informed me, that though the people in his quarter had been offended with my &s;peech at Mingo creek, they had come home well plea&s;ed with my behaviour in the affair of Braddock's field; and now talked of making Bradford or me governor, on this &s;ide of the mountains. This led me to think there mu&s;t have been &s;ome talk of an independent government. I had taken it for granted there had been; and in my letter to Tench Coxe, which I wrote about this time, &s;ugge&s;ted it. But on going to Parkin&s;on's ferry, I heard not a whi&s;per of the kind. I &s;ound|ed James Mar&s;hall, by a&s;king, when I read his re&s;olutions, that &s;eemed to contemplate defen&s;ive operations, By what &s;y&s;tem he meant to act? was it by the organization of a government; or &s;imply by a committee? I found that he had never thought of any thing but a committee.</P>
<P>In our way to this meeting, we had found liberty poles in abundance. At Parkin&s;on's ferry, I think it was the morning of the &s;econd day, one was rai&s;ed, with a flag with &s;ix &s;tripes, emblematical of the &s;ix counties there repre&s;ented. I fell in with Benjamin Parkin&s;on, carrying down a board, with an in|&s;cription, to fix upon the pole. I read the in&s;cription; it was,
<Q><LIST>
<ITEM>Equal taxation, and no exci&s;e.</ITEM>
<ITEM>No a&s;ylum for traitors and cowards.</ITEM>
</LIST></Q>
Thought I, there are two of us, then, that ought to be away: For you are a coward, and I am a traitor; for I do not mean to go to war, and if you do, you will not fight. This was the character of Benjamin.</P>
<P>This morning, ju&s;t before the opening of the committee, Torence Campbell, of We&s;tmoreland, came to me, and informed me, that the exci&s;e law was not the only object with which the people were di&s;&s;atisfied; the high &s;alaries of officers, both in the general and &s;tate governments, were a grievance; that he had
<PB N="100" REF="028332_0097_0FD89A85D57F43F0">
prepared re&s;olves on this, and &s;ome other &s;ubjects, which he would hand to me to bring forward. I took him a&s;ide into the bu&s;hes, as if to communicate &s;ome great &s;tate &s;ecrets, and in|formed him, that the plan agreed upon, was not to take up more things than one at once;&mdash;let us bull-bait the exci&s;e law for the pre&s;ent, and, in due time, we will knock down every thing el&s;e.</P>
<P>Campbell had been &s;ecretary to a meeting in his county, and had draughted a remon&s;trance again&s;t the u&s;e of judges in courts, and wi&s;hed only ju&s;tices.</P>
<P>A number of other per&s;ons were anxious to bring forward re&s;olves, and motions, to the &s;ame effect with Torence. But it was given them to under&s;tand, that the policy of the occa&s;ion did not admit &s;o general a reform all at once.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XI.</HEAD>
<P>I HAVE mentioned James Ro&s;s, as a commi&s;&s;ioner on the part of the United States; the others were, William Bradford, attorney general of the United States, and Ja&s;per Yates, a judge of the &s;upreme court of Penn&s;ylvania. The two la&s;t had arriv|ed at Parkin&s;on's ferry, a &s;hort time after the adjournment of the meeting; from thence they came Pitt&s;burgh. Being known to the attorney general, and the judge, I waited on them, at the public hou&s;e, after their arrival. I found major Craig giv|ing them a tragical account of the cruel treatment of Kirkpa|trick, Neville, and the others, by the people of Pitt&s;burgh, in &s;ending them away. I felt great indignation; and addre&s;&s;ed him before the commi&s;&s;ioners: Said I, The repre&s;entation is not ju&s;t; you are impo&s;ing upon the&s;e gentlemen; you are leading them to &s;uppo&s;e, that the people of Pitt&s;burgh expelled the&s;e men; it was the country. We acted as their guardians in &s;end|ing them away; the act was for them, more than for our&s;elves. Here I gave a detail of the circum&s;tances. He was &s;ilent, and withdrew.</P>
<P>I had di&s;covered in the commi&s;&s;ioners, unfavourable impre&s;|&s;ions towards me; I was at a lo&s;s, whether to attribute them to what they had heard on the way, or to the account of Craig.
<PB N="101" REF="028332_0098_0FD89A87B6BE7EF0">
An expre&s;&s;ion of the attorney general &s;truck me much. In my ob&s;ervations on the account of Craig, I had &s;aid, that I had never con&s;idered my&s;elf as an in&s;urgent. I was employed to negociate for tho&s;e who were; but that did not involve the fact, that I was one my&s;elf. Said the attorney general, "That will be a &s;ubject of future con&s;ideration." I was with the commi&s;&s;ion|ers but a &s;hort time; finding the point of view in which I conceiv|ed my&s;elf to &s;tand with them. The expre&s;&s;ion of the attorney gen|eral had hurt my mind; and, with the language of Craig, became the &s;ubject of very &s;erious reflections. I con&s;idered Craig but as an automaton; and that his impre&s;&s;ions mu&s;t be tho&s;e with which colonel Neville went away. That being the ca&s;e, I had rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e that this repre&s;entation would be the &s;ame which Neville would make to the executive. The people of Pitt&s;burgh, and in particular my&s;elf, would be held up as in&s;ur|gents. After all my labour to get matters &s;ettled, this family would con&s;ider me as having injured them; and when they re|turned, I &s;hould be in&s;ulted by them. I had found it hard e|nough, in the village before, to &s;upport my&s;elf again&s;t them; but it would be wor&s;e now. I began to con&s;ider, whether it would not be better to &s;tand with the Sans Culottes of the coun|try, and keep the&s;e men away, while they were away. But was it practicable? I could not reconcile it to my&s;elf to di&s;turb the union; that would be a wickedne&s;s beyond all po&s;&s;ibility of contemplation. But this country might &s;ecede from it. That is a right that is never given up in &s;ociety. A part of a coun|try, as well as an individual, may quit a government; and no doubt this country will quit the United States, in due time. That may be by a con&s;ent of the union, or without it. But at pre&s;ent there would be no con&s;ent. The example would be dan|gerous to give. Common intere&s;t would not &s;uffer it. We are bound to the union for our proportion of the public debt. We mu&s;t di&s;charge demands again&s;t the partner&s;hip, before the firm, as to that, can be legally di&s;&s;olved. The United States have land beyond us; they cannot &s;uffer us to &s;hut them out from the&s;e, by an independent government between.</P>
<P>But is it practicable to e&s;tabli&s;h and &s;upport &s;uch a govern|ment? Perhaps it might;&mdash;claim the&s;e lands to the we&s;tward, and invite all the world to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of them. Collect all the banditti on the frontiers of the &s;tate, to help us to fight for them; tell the Spaniards to come up to the mouth of the Ohio, and give us a free trade; let the Briti&s;h keep the po&s;ts, and furni&s;h us with arms and ammunition; get the Indians of the
<PB N="102" REF="028332_0099_0FD898DE5B40AB58">
woods to a&s;&s;i&s;t us; tell them, that the people on the ea&s;t of the mountains want our whi&s;key, and their lands;&mdash;we might wage wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, and perhaps &s;ucceed. It is true, we &s;hould &s;ucceed to mi&s;ery, for a while, and poverty at la&s;t. But even this would be more tolerable to me, than to live under any circum&s;tances, &s;u&s;pected by the government, and treated with contumely by the&s;e people, when they had returned, loaded with the favours of the government, as having been the great defenders of it.</P>
<P>The&s;e were the thoughts of a night. When I &s;aw James Ro&s;s in the morning, I explained to him my chagrin of the preceding day, and my reflections in con&s;equence of it; and gave him to under&s;tand, that I had half a mind to become an in&s;urgent. He took it more &s;eriou&s;ly than I intended it; his expre&s;&s;ion was, "The force of genius is almighty; give them not the aid of yours."</P>
<P>I told him, that nothing but &s;elf-pre&s;ervation would lead me to think of it; or the being unju&s;tly &s;u&s;pected. He &s;oothed my mind, by a&s;&s;uring me, that no &s;u&s;picion could po&s;&s;ibly fall on me; that the commi&s;&s;ioners, the preceding day, were perfectly &s;atisfied with the explanation I had given in the pre&s;ence of Craig; and that what he had &s;aid, had not left the lea&s;t impre&s;|&s;ion.</P>
<P>Commi&s;&s;ioners on the part of the &s;tate of Penn&s;ylvania, had been appointed by the governor; and had arrived. The&s;e were, the honourable Thomas M'Kean, chief ju&s;tice of the &s;tate, and general William Irwin.</P>
<P>A liberty-pole was rai&s;ed in Pitt&s;burgh, in the pre&s;ence of the commi&s;&s;ioners; and it was with the greate&s;t difficulty, that we could prevent the hoi&s;ting the &s;ix &s;tripes upon it. The flag was made, and ready to be put up. The people were pre|vailed upon to &s;ub&s;titute the fifteen. Yet it was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> where the po&s;&s;e was to have been rai&s;ed.</P>
<P>I fell in with Gallatin, the morning of our opening our con|ference with the commi&s;&s;ioners. Said I, You under&s;tand me, Mr. Gallatin. I do, &s;aid he, perfectly. It was the fir&s;t con|ver&s;ation I had with him, &s;ince our modelling the re&s;olutions, at Parkin&s;on's ferry; and I did not know but that he might have mi&s;conceived my &s;peeches. I explained to him the policy with which I had found it nece&s;&s;ary to act; and the fears I had entertained on that occa&s;ion, lea&s;t, by openly oppo&s;ing, and bringing the matter to que&s;tion, it &s;hould be carried again&s;t him: That he had pre&s;umed more upon the powers of elo|quence, and the rea&s;on of the people, than he was warranted
<PB N="103" REF="028332_0100_0FD898DF34FEE8E8">
in doing, where the pa&s;&s;ions were &s;o violent; that a more par|ticular acquaintance with the fury of the people from what I had heard from Wa&s;hington, and &s;een at the Mingo meeting, and at Braddock's fields, enabled me to judge.</P>
<P>This was the fir&s;t conver&s;ation that I ever had with Albert Gallatin in my life. I have under&s;tood from him &s;ince, that, at Parkin&s;on's ferry, he had been &s;omewhat at a lo&s;s to know my drift perfectly; but that James Ro&s;s had explained to him, and he under&s;tood it.</P>
<P>The point was now gained, to which I had always looked forward; the point where the foot was to be fixed, in order to make an open &s;tand again&s;t the in&s;urrection. This was my expre&s;&s;ion to James Ro&s;s, when I walked out of the circle of the committee, at Parkin&s;on's ferry, having carried the appoint|ing the committee to confer with the commi&s;&s;ioners. The point is gained, &s;aid I; there is a ba&s;is now laid, from which we can act: to this point I had always looked forward, not expecting commi&s;&s;ioners from the government, but propo&s;itions from it to commi&s;&s;ioners, on our part, holding out an amne&s;ty, which I took to be the great &s;ecret of compo&s;ing the di&s;turbance. Until that appeared, the di&s;po&s;ition of tho&s;e involved; would lead them to cut throats, to &s;upport them&s;elves; and the whole country, con&s;cious that every man had, in &s;ome degree, contri|buted, by words or actions, to produce that mental oppo&s;ition to the law, which had terminated in actual force, could not re|concile it to their feelings, to abandon tho&s;e who had acted, with precipitation, in the late in&s;tances. But an amne&s;ty being given, the&s;e could &s;ay to their countrymen, You are now on a ground with us; &s;top, we wil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> go no further.</P>
<P>I con&s;idered the appointment of commi&s;&s;ioners, on the part of the executive, as a pledge of amne&s;ty; though I had yet no information of their powers. I therefore &s;aw the way clear for the country to get out; and now the conduct ought no longer to be, a concealment of intentions, and a half-way acquie&s;cence, but an explicit avowal of opinions.</P>
<P>On this principle, I took the fir&s;t opportunity I had with Bradford and Mar&s;hall, and it was in the pre&s;ence of one of the committee, before any conference with the commi&s;&s;ioners, to inform them of my real &s;entiments, with regard to the viola|lation of the laws, which had taken place; and particularly with reg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rd to tho&s;e in which they had been implicated; the intercepting the mail, and the rendezvous at Braddock's fields. Bradford looked red and angry, Mar&s;hall pale and affected.</P>
<P><PB N="104" REF="028332_0101_0FD8856F2725A6F8">My impre&s;&s;ion always was, that Mar&s;hall had become &s;en&s;ible of the ra&s;hne&s;s of the acts, and would be willing to make a good retreat as &s;peedily as po&s;&s;ible. Until this time, al&s;o, I had an idea that Bradford would be manageable, as &s;oon as he could &s;ee his way out. I had &s;ome apprehen&s;ions now, and explained this to James Ro&s;s; and it was agreed, to &s;peak to general Ir|win, whom we under&s;tood to be a favourite with Bradford, to take him in tow, and &s;ee what he could do with him. Our rea|&s;on for &s;uppo&s;ing Irwin a favourite, was a circum&s;tance of Brad|ford, while in the legi&s;lature of Penn&s;ylvania, voting &s;ingly for Irwin, in the election of a &s;enator of the United States, not|with&s;tanding Irwin was not in nomination at the time, and no other per&s;on voted for him. The chief ju&s;tice al&s;o undertook to manage him.</P>
<P>It was with a view to manage Bradford, and al&s;o to have a good effect with others of the committee, who&s;e &s;entiments I did not know, that in our fir&s;t conference with the commi&s;&s;ion|ers, I &s;tated, at &s;ome length, in &s;trong terms, the pa&s;t and pre&s;ent grievances of this country. My idea was, that having &s;hewed my&s;elf impre&s;&s;ed with a &s;en&s;e of all the&s;e evils, in addi|tion to the exci&s;e law, and yet di&s;po&s;ed to yield, others well might, who had not appeared to have &s;o &s;trong an impre&s;&s;ion of them.</P>
<P>Our committee had conceived them&s;elves appointed only to receive and report propo&s;itions. But the commi&s;&s;ioners in&s;i&s;ted on acquie&s;cing or rejecting; as otherwi&s;e they would not think it worth their while to continue the negotiation. I did not think our acquie&s;cing would be of any u&s;e. We would appear to have exceeded our authority; and having given our a&s;&s;ent, we could not come forward in the committee, to which we were to make report, as deliberating with others, whether we &s;hould accede, or not; and a &s;tate of deliberation for my&s;elf, as others, is that in which I would chu&s;e to be, in order to bring others with me; making them believe that they had half per&s;uaded me, when in fact I had wholly per&s;uaded them.</P>
<P>My &s;y&s;tem from the commencement, had been to take the bu&s;ine&s;s out of the hands of the multitude, as &s;peedily as po&s;&s;i|ble, by in&s;tituting an exten&s;ive committee. Not to take a final que&s;tion; but having enlightened that committee, and rendered them moderate, to make u&s;e of them as evangeli&s;ts among&s;t the people, when they went home, to di&s;&s;eminate the proper doc|trines. It was on this principle, that I had &s;ugge&s;ted the Park|in&s;on's ferry meeting. The fury of the people, at that meet|ing,
<PB N="105" REF="028332_0102_0FD898E0BA98AFC8">
led me to &s;ee the nece&s;&s;ity of reducing the country into &s;till &s;maller bounds, by a committee extracted from the fir&s;t. It was on this principle, I approved and &s;upported the appoint|ment of a &s;tanding committee; even this committee was too large, with which to break the bu&s;ine&s;s, and therefore I wi&s;hed the &s;maller committee of twelve, to be the body with which we &s;hould begin to act. Having in&s;tructed and enlightened the&s;e, and gained their a&s;&s;ent, we &s;hould come forward with them to the &s;tanding committee, as &s;o many di&s;ciples, not wounding the pride of others by having taken it upon them, without their con|currence, to judge; but deliberating, as if not having judged at all.</P>
<P>Having in&s;tructed and converted the &s;tanding committee, we &s;hould &s;end them home to di&s;ciple as many as they could; and come forward in the original and exten&s;ive committee, in order to govern the re&s;ult. In the mean time, by the gazettes and hand bills, to reach the body of the people with rea&s;onings on the &s;ubject. If this &s;y&s;tem could have been adopted, it might have &s;ucceeded. For it is a great mi&s;take to &s;uppo&s;e that Brad|ford or Mar&s;hall, or others, led the people. It was the people led them. It was the ma&s;s of the people that commanded; and it was the fear of them, that operated on the minds of the more con&s;picuous individuals. Even Bradford was the mo&s;t ob&s;tinate, becau&s;e he was the greate&s;t coward. He had not reach of thought, to &s;ee the danger from the government; but the dan|ger from the people was ju&s;t before his no&s;e.</P>
<P>This was the &s;y&s;tem of proceeding which I had laid down in my mind, and agreeable to which, we urged with the commi&s;|&s;ioners the &s;uffering us to go forward to the &s;tanding commit|tee, with the report merely; without having given our opinion on the propo&s;ition, as a committee; and to wait until the &s;tand|ing committee &s;hould have called the original repre&s;entatives at Parkin&s;on's, or a new general convention.</P>
<P>The commi&s;&s;ioners thought it more advi&s;eable that the com|mittee of twleve &s;hould declare their &s;entiments, on the propo&s;i|tion, and make it part of our report to the &s;tanding committee; and as to delaying until the original or a new repre&s;entation of the people could be called, at Parkin&s;on's, it was impracticable, as the &s;ea&s;on was advancing; and if offen&s;ive operations mu&s;t be commenced again&s;t the country, the Pre&s;ident mu&s;t know it &s;oon.</P>
<P>This was deci&s;ive. I had it, al&s;o, in confidence, at the time, from one or more of the commi&s;&s;ioners, that there was danger
<PB N="106" REF="028332_0103_0FD898E230D3AA10">
of the flame &s;preading from the country; that di&s;contents had actually begun to &s;hew them&s;elves, and the like outrages to break out, in other places; that, for this rea&s;on, if conciliation did not an&s;wer the end, &s;evere remedie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> mu&s;t be &s;peedily ap|plied.</P>
<P>Thus, the conduct of the people below, contributed to de|prive us of that time, that was nece&s;&s;ary to bring the public mind, among&s;t our&s;elves, to a proper &s;en&s;e of intere&s;t and duty.</P>
<P>In draughting our report, which had been committed to me, on the part of our committee, I had introduced our &s;tatement, at lea&s;t the &s;tatement made by me, of our general grievances in this country. It was with a view to &s;hew the people, that we had made the mo&s;t of our ca&s;e, and of cour&s;e mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed to have got the be&s;t terms, that could be given; and if we, who had been thus impre&s;&s;ed, had yielded, they might. The commi&s;&s;ioners thought it might rather &s;trengthen oppo&s;ition in their minds, and it was &s;truck out.</P>
<P>I had &s;tated &s;trongly, on the part of the commi&s;&s;ioners, the &s;en&s;e they had expre&s;&s;ed of the outrages committed; the burn|ing, the expul&s;ions, and e&s;pecially the intercepting the mail, and the march to Braddock's fields. It was with a view to bring the&s;e &s;trongly before the minds of the people, that, &s;en&s;ible of the attrocity, they might the more appreciate the value of an amne&s;ty. But I am di&s;po&s;ed to believe, that this gave offence to Mar&s;hall and Bradford, who had been implicated in the la&s;t acts. For I can no otherwi&s;e account for the di&s;&s;atisfaction they di&s;covered towards me, from this time. I cannot believe that Mar&s;hall, e&s;pecially, was at all di&s;&s;atisfied at being relieved from the extremely hazardous &s;ituation in which he had been in|volved.</P>
<P>Concluding the report, I added &s;ome rea&s;ons, which had been &s;ugge&s;ted, at lea&s;t by my&s;elf, in the committee, as ground<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of conceding to the propo&s;itions of the commi&s;&s;ioners. They were &s;uch, as I thought would have weight with the people. Albert Gallatin, in his &s;peech, in the legi&s;lature of Penn&s;ylva|nia, on the &s;ubject of the in&s;urrection, &s;peaking of the&s;e rea|&s;ons, &s;ays, "They are, I &s;uppo&s;e, &s;uch as, in the judgment of the author, would make the mo&s;t impre&s;&s;ion upon the people. On that head, however, I think he was mi&s;taken." I think now, as I did then, that they were the mo&s;t likely to impre&s;s; but that is a matter of opinion, I am not going to di&s;pute a|bout it. The true democratic principle, on which it &s;hould be put, doubtle&s;s was, that "the will of the majority &s;hould go|vern:
<PB N="107" REF="028332_0104_0FD898E3B3ED0B88">
the national will had made the law, and it &s;hould be o|beyed." However unequal and oppre&s;&s;ive, on this part of the community, we might &s;uppo&s;e it; yet the good of the whole demanded our &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>It is an ab&s;tract argument that mu&s;t &s;atisfy the under&s;tand|ing; but can never reconcile the heart. It is preci&s;ely the &s;ame with the theological argument of the divines, The good of the whole requires that &s;ome &s;hould be damned; and a man cannot be a &s;aint, until he feels a di&s;po&s;ition to be reconciled to the Divine will, in this particular, even if it &s;hould fall to his lot to go to hell. A man regenerated may come to this, but a natural man never will: &s;o an enlightened politician, may comprehend and acquie&s;ce in the principle of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, to in|equality of burdens, when the nation dooms him to it; but the common mind revolts; and nothing will quiet him, but the con|&s;ideration, that he cannot help him&s;elf. My argument, there|fore, chiefly contemplated the want of power; and &s;ometimes, by introducing an idea of po&s;tponement, on the ground of ex|i&s;ting circum&s;tances, I endeavoured to get an acquie&s;cence for the pre&s;ent. U&s;ing this argument with one, his an&s;wer was, "The people never can be rou&s;ed again." I knew that; and it was on this principle I &s;ugge&s;ted it. It was quite &s;afe to talk of another day; for if the devil had been once laid, it would be difficult to rai&s;e him again. The people would begin to look back, and be made &s;en&s;ible of the precipice on which they had been &s;tanding. Let the law be put in operation, and they would not find it the evil they had conceived it to be.</P>
<P>At the reque&s;t of the commi&s;&s;ioners, it had been urged to call a meeting of the &s;tanding committee, at an earlier day than appointed. They were called to meet on the 28th of Augu&s;t.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XII.</HEAD>
<P>OUR committee of conference met at Brown&s;ville, on the morning of the 28th of Augu&s;t. Brown&s;ville is on the Monon|gah<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">la, at the mouth of a &s;tream, known by the name of Red|&s;tone.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t thing that &s;truck us, was a party of men, perhaps <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">, armed with rifles; who had marched from the upper part of Wa&s;hington, with a view, as we under&s;tood, to take the per|&s;on, and burn the buildings, mill, dwelling hou&s;e, &amp;c. of Sa|muel Jack&s;on, near that place, who had given offence, by an expre&s;&s;ion di&s;re&s;pectful to the committee. Pains were taken to di&s;&s;uade from outrage; informing them, that, by the arrange|ments made at Parkin&s;on's ferry, all complaints again&s;t offen|ders, were to come before the committee, who were to decide upon the criminality, and upon the puni&s;hment. They were prevailed upon to be contented with having him brought before the committee, and tried in form<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> but in&s;i&s;ted upon going, with a file of men, to bring him.</P>
<P>The committee of &s;ixty having met, which was under a &s;hade of boards, con&s;tructed for the occa&s;ion, Edward Cook was con&s;tituted chairman, and Albert Gallatin, &s;ecretary.</P>
<P>Samuel Jack&s;on had been, by this time, brought up and was before the committee. He was of the denomination of the peo|ple, called Quakers; a tall man, wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h a broad brim to his hat. He pre&s;erved a grave demeanor, and &s;tood with an appearance of compo&s;ed &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the &s;ufferings that might await him.</P>
<P>The charge again&s;t him was, that &s;peaking of the committee, he had called it a Scrub Congre&s;s. The charge was proved by two witne&s;&s;es. The que&s;tion now was, What puni&s;hment &s;hould be inflic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> if he was found guilty, in the language of &s;cripture, of "&s;peaking evil of dignities?" By the Scotti&s;h law it was what is called "lee&s;e-making," and &s;ubjects to tran&s;|portation. By the common law of England, which is our law, it might be con&s;trued "&s;edition," indictable and puni&s;hable as a mi&s;demeanor. In the delicate &s;ituation in which the country then was, it was thought to be a dangerous language, tending to le&s;&s;en the re&s;pect due to the newly con&s;tituted authorities, and
<PB N="109" REF="028332_0106_0FD898E9B4AAAA80">
evincing a bad di&s;po&s;ition towards the cau&s;e of the people. A general and &s;incere concern was felt for the man, becau&s;e it was made a &s;erious matter by the country, and e&s;pecially by the bo|dy of armed men who had marched a di&s;tance of 20 or 30 miles, to do execution on his per&s;on and property. There were of the committee, who mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed incen&s;ed, and of cour&s;e re&s;entful of the in&s;ult.</P>
<P>I had recour&s;e to my u&s;ual expedient in de&s;perate ca&s;es; plea&s;antry. I recollect, &s;aid I, to have read, that, in the time of Oliver Cromwell, lord protector of England, when he was in the height of his glory, a per&s;on came to him, and gave him information of words, u&s;ed by another, greatly contemp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">uous of his dignity; viz. he has &s;aid, that your excellency may ki&s;s his &mdash;. You may tell him, &s;aid Oliver, that he may ki&s;s mine. This Quaker has called us a Scrub Congre&s;s; let our &s;entence be, that he &s;hall be called a Scrub him&s;elf.</P>
<P>The &s;tory of Cromwell had produced a &s;udden, involuntary, and loud laugh, and thrown a light upon the affair of Jack&s;on; introducing a proper &s;entiment with regard to him, viz. that there was more magnanimity in di&s;regarding his expre&s;&s;ions, than in puni&s;hing them. The troop that had brought him, laughed, and took him off to give him the epithet. He got a bucket of whi&s;key and water, to drink with them, and we heard no more of it.</P>
<P>The report was now about to be read; and a number of copies having been &s;truck off, they were di&s;tributed among&s;t the mem|bers. While it was reading, there appeared great agitation in the committee. At &s;ome &s;entences, a rumour, as in a church at the re&s;pon&s;e.&mdash;Not, "Lord help us to keep this law;" but that of, "Good Lord deliver us."</P>
<P>The popular mind had, by this time, gone far beyond the idea of an amne&s;ty; and they rather thought of giving an am|ne&s;ty, than of taking it; pa&s;&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> by the injuries of government, on condition that it did not repeat them. They had expected a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of the law; or, at lea&s;t, a promi&s;e of a repeal of it.</P>
<P>I was a good deal alarmed; and &s;aw that it would not do to come forward in defence of the report, immediately. It would be nece&s;&s;ary to give them time to reflect a little; and to prepare the way, by a general conver&s;ation, out of doors. Finley, Smiley, and other popular men, were on the ground, and might contribute to inform the people.</P>
<P>It had &s;truck Gallatin, and others, in the &s;ame point of view, and it was moved to adjourn, until the next morning. It was
<PB N="110" REF="028332_0107_0FD88571682B43A0">
with a view to give the members time to con&s;ider the report. An adjournment took place; and I heard Bradford calling out, for the Wa&s;hington members to convene by them&s;elves.</P>
<P>I had cro&s;&s;ed the river that night, and lodged at a farm hou&s;e, on the we&s;t &s;ide; and this, not only with a view to con|venience, but al&s;o to be out of the way, if, in con&s;equence of di&s;&s;atisfaction with our report, any per&s;onal violence, to the committee of twelve, or any of them, &s;hould be meditated; a thing wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ch I thought not at all improbable: for what avails popularity in &s;uch times as the&s;e? it is but the turning of the hand; the palm up or down; from the height of favour, to the lowe&s;t point of obloquy and per&s;ecution. Was there any man in Penn&s;ylvania, more popular than John Dickin&s;on, at the commencement of the American revolution? he was &s;aid to be oppo&s;ed to a declaration of independence, and became ob|noxious. James Wil&s;on was at the height of political fame, a|mong&s;t the people; but he had di&s;approved of the form of con&s;ti|tution, they had adopted in the commonwealth, and they were about to murder him in his own hou&s;e. I po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, at this pre&s;ent time, the be&s;t kind of popularity, viz. that obtained af|ter much obloquy, through a &s;eries of years, &s;uffered to cor|rect it&s;elf: a popularity obtained, doubtle&s;s, by &s;ailing a little with the popular gale; at lea&s;t, not oppo&s;ing it; but chiefly by a &s;teady and upright demeanor in my profe&s;&s;ion. The popular mind, though pa&s;&s;ionate, is generous; and if it becomes &s;en&s;ible that it has wronged a man, will repair it. I mean to explain this more fully, as far as regards my&s;elf, in the conclu&s;ion of this narrative.</P>
<P>But though po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing, at this time, a &s;olid popularity, I knew that a breath, on the &s;ubject of the exci&s;e law, would put it to a temporary death. However, I had no thought now of the lo&s;s of popularity, but &s;o far as it would produce permanent danger, in the ground. Gallatin was in his own county, among&s;t a people more moderate, and he might be in le&s;s danger; ne|verthele&s;s, he was not without apprehen&s;ions, and had rea&s;on.</P>
<P>In the morning, cro&s;&s;ing the river, and coming into the vil|lage, I was led to under&s;tand, that&punc; at the private meeting of the Wa&s;hington members, the preceding evening, great warmth, and a talk of guillo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing, was heard, and the clapping of hands. <HI>I</HI> met Gallatin, and James Lang, a member of the committee of twelve; and who was of that village, and was greatly alarm|ed, from what he had &s;een and heard. It was early, and the committe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of &s;ixty had not yet collected, and the gallery, of
<PB N="111" REF="028332_0108_0FD898EB38E0AF28">
which great numbers were from the neighbourhood of the Min|go meeting-hou&s;e, had not yet convened. I had conver&s;ed with &s;ome, the preceding evening, before I left the village; and found &s;trong prejudices again&s;t me, as having made u&s;e of my talents, as a lawyer, to per&s;uade the committee of conference to the acquie&s;cence with the propo&s;itions of the commi&s;&s;ioners. It was in&s;inuated that we had been bribed; and it was told my|&s;elf, that attornies would take fees. I he&s;itated, therefore, whe|ther I &s;hould remain or not. It might be &s;afe&s;t to return to Pitt&s;burgh. I thought of this; more e&s;pecially, as I had ob|&s;erved, that Bradford had pre&s;erved a di&s;tance from me, and appeared to be di&s;&s;atisfied. I knew that the example of arre&s;t|ing members in the French Convention, the knowledge of which was familiar here, might lead to the arre&s;ting me, or others that were obnoxious; and between an arre&s;t and putting to death, as there, &s;o here, there would be but little interval. Gallatin acknowledged him&s;elf not in&s;en&s;ible of the delicacy of the &s;ituation; and that in&s;ult, at lea&s;t, might be offered; but ob&s;erved, that we had bound our&s;elves, in honour, to the com|mi&s;&s;ioners, to come forward, and &s;upport the propo&s;itions. I reflected with my&s;elf, that, neverthele&s;s, in this undertaking of our committee of conference with the commi&s;&s;ioners, it was not under&s;tood, that we were to run a ri&s;k of life, or even in|dignities, in recommending their own intere&s;t to the people. However, as Gallatin was di&s;po&s;ed to try it, I was willing. It was then con&s;idered, what &s;hould be the order of our &s;peaking; there was a reluctance with each of us, to break the bu&s;ine&s;s. I propo&s;ed, that we &s;hould get James Edgar, a member of the committee of twelve, to begin. He was an a&s;&s;ociate judge of the court of Wa&s;hington, and a kind of a rabbi in the Pre&s;by|terian churches of the we&s;tern country: had been a pre&s;byter, or elder, from his youth; had been a member of committees, in the early period of the American revolution; and of legi&s;la|tive a&s;&s;emblies, executive and cen&s;orial councils, or deliberative conventions, ever &s;ince. His head was prematurely hoary, with prayers, and fa&s;tings, and religious exerci&s;es; his face thin and puritanic, like the figures of the old republicans, in the time of the long parliament in England. He was a man of &s;en&s;e, and not de&s;titute of eloquence. It was agreed, that he &s;hould open the way for us. It was propo&s;ed to him, but he appeared reluc|tant; I know not on what principle. It was impo&s;ed, there|fore, upon Gallatin.</P>
<P>The committee having convened, with a formidable gallery,
<PB N="112" REF="028332_0109_0FD898ECF64F6D58">
as the day before, Gallatin addre&s;&s;ed the ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ir, in a &s;peech of &s;ome hours. It was a piece of perfect eloquence; and was heard with attention, and without di&s;turbance. I &s;hall not undertake to give the &s;cope of this &s;peech, as I could not do it ju&s;tice; and probably they have mi&s;conceived, and mignt mi&s;take &s;ome part of it.</P>
<P>I followed Gallatin, in a &s;peech of &s;ome length, but under that advantage, which a &s;peaker feels, when he attempts a &s;ub|ject recently exhau&s;ted. In the cour&s;e of advocating, Gallatin had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ply traver&s;ed the ground of di&s;tinction between our ca&s;e, and the ca&s;e of America at the revolution. In our ca&s;e, no prin|ciple was violated; we had been repre&s;ented, and were &s;till to be repre&s;ented in the body which enacted the law. He exam|ined the exci&s;e l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">w it&s;elf, and &s;hewed the ameliorations, which had taken place, as to the quantum of duty, and the mode and means of rai&s;ing it, and repre&s;ented the probable extinction of it in due time altogether. He explained the conce&s;&s;ions made by the commi&s;&s;ioners, in the relinqui&s;hment of arrearages, com|prehended under a &s;tipulation in the propo&s;itions, that "benefi|cial arrangements would be made." He di&s;cu&s;&s;ed the local, and exi&s;ting rea&s;ons of our complaints; the Indian war; our obtaining the po&s;ts, the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi trade, by the negociation of the union. He painted the mi&s;chiefs which had been done, and would &s;till farther be done to this country, if we per&s;i&s;ted in oppo&s;ition; by weakening the &s;pirit of liberty it&s;elf; of which the in&s;urrection in the &s;tate of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts was an example, formerly the mo&s;t democratic &s;tate in the union, now the mo&s;t ari&s;tocratic. For certain it is, the illegal oppo&s;ition, when re|duced, has a tendency to make the people abject, and the gov|ernment tyrannie. He con&s;idered the injury to the &s;pirit of li|berty throughout the union, and the injury to the republican cau&s;e throughout the world. He demon&s;trated the &s;uperiority of the &s;tructure of our republic, over all that had been; and painted the atrocity of undermining or &s;haking the fabric. He took a full and con&s;picuous view of the comparative &s;trength and re&s;ources of a conte&s;t of this country with the United States; the &s;uperiority in numbers, advantage of funds, &s;ea coa&s;ts. He repelled the ab&s;urdity of expecting, if any did expect, counte|nance or a&s;&s;i&s;tance from Spain, or Britain. If eve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> by a&s;&s;i&s;tance, or without, a defence would be made, the much to be lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">, and the little to be gained in the re&s;ult. Finally, the compli|cated ignominy and ruin, on all the&s;e principles, of per&s;i&s;ting in a cour&s;e, that was bad in it&s;elf, and hopele&s;s in its &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="113" REF="028332_0110_0FD898EE34263070">It was a difficulty with me to find any thing new that could be advanced; and I &s;poke more for the &s;ake of &s;hewing that I had courage to &s;peak, than from an idea that I could add to the argument, or improve the impre&s;&s;ion that had been made. However I exerted my invention to vary the light of the argu|ment, and to add &s;omething new. Gallatin had addre&s;&s;ed him|&s;elf chiefly to the patrioti&s;m of the audience. I addre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf to their con&s;cience and fears. I confe&s;s that it was in their fears that I had the mo&s;t confidence. Gallatin had been didactic and deliberate, though animated. I became more impa&s;&s;ioned, and declamatory. My ob&s;ervations were to the following ef|fect:</P>
<P>It &s;eems to be an idea entertained by the people that we can remain a part of the government, and yet wage war again&s;t it. That is impo&s;&s;ible, in the nature of the ca&s;e; we are known to the government by repre&s;entation only, and not by force. We mu&s;t therefore either overthrow it, or it mu&s;t overthrow us. But we have &s;worn to &s;upport it. If we contemplate the over|throwing it&punc; Where is our oath of allegiance? But can we over|throw it? we might as well think of to&s;&s;ing the Allegheny mountain from its ba&s;e.</P>
<P>But we may obtain a repeal of the law, by an exhibition of force; by po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the mountain, and making a &s;hew of arms. That is not probable, after the &s;teps taken by the Pre&s;ident. On principle of example, it would &s;o vitally affect the &s;afety of the government, that it can never be countenanced.

<P>But cannot we &s;ecede from the union? not, and remain a part of the government at the &s;ame time.

But have we a right to di&s;&s;olve our union with both? an individual may emigrate from &s;ociety; and a part of a &s;ociety may &s;eparate from the whole, but an individual cannot leave a &s;tate in war, becau&s;e he owes &s;ervice for the benefits he has enjoyed in peace. He cannot leave it without di&s;charging debts he owes to individuals, or to the public.

<P>I have heretofore felt my&s;elf embarra&s;&s;ed, in knowing what to do&punc; I con&s;idered the feelings of the country with partiality of heart; knowing the ground of them to be, the unequal law in que&s;tion. I made excu&s;es for the&s;e breaking into acts; know|ing it to be the error of judgment, not di&s;tingui&s;hing between what feelings are, and what acts ought to be. I was impre&s;|&s;ed with the reflection, that the di&s;approbation of the law hav|ing been general, in the country, and expre&s;&s;ed by almo&s;t ev|ery one, no man could tell how far, by words, he might have contributed to that current of re&s;entment, which, at length, &s;welled beyond the con&s;titutional banks of repre&s;entation and remon&s;trance, and broke our into outrage.

Be&s;ides, living in the country for a number of years, and, in my profe&s;&s;ional capacity, having much acquaintance, and many attachments, it was natural for me, to wi&s;h to &s;ave, from error of conduct, and danger of life, tho&s;e who had violated law, by accompli&s;h|ing an accommodation, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ettling terms of oblivion. If the&s;e are not accepted, I am done; and con&s;ider my&s;elf as di&s;charged, in honour, and in con&s;cience, from all further concern in the bu&s;ine&s;s. It is, therefore, the la&s;t and only advice I have to
<PB N="116" REF="028332_0113_0FD898F695E75C60">
give, that you acquie&s;ce with the propo&s;itions of the commi&s;&s;ion|ers, and accept the amne&s;ty offered you. It is the expedient left to &s;ave the country, which has been already impaired <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">nd reduced, by our late hi&s;tory. It was improving in agriculture, repleni&s;hing with buildings, becoming an object of emigration from abroad; and is now dejected, from this height, to a con|&s;iderable depth, from what it was. The value of property is reduced, from what has happened. I do not con&s;ider what I po&s;&s;e&s;s, at this moment, as of more than one half of the value of what it was three months ago; but it will be &s;till wor&s;e, un|le&s;s the evils that are impending, are prevented by an immedi|ate acquie&s;cence.</P>
<P>The above is the &s;ub&s;tance of what was &s;aid by me, but at that time developed and detailed to a greater extent.</P>
<P>Edgar followed me, with great earne&s;tne&s;s, and with the &s;o|lemnity of an evening &s;ermon, in a di&s;cour&s;e of great length.</P>
<P>Bradford now ro&s;e to &s;peak; and, contrary to his engage|ments&punc; with the commi&s;&s;ioners, per&s;onally, and his agreement with the report of the committee, he oppo&s;ed the acceptance of the propo&s;itions, in direct and violent terms. Speaking of the re&s;ources of war, arms, ammunition, &amp;c. &s;aid he, "We will defeat the fir&s;t army that comes over the mountains, and take their arms and baggage."</P>
<P>"Not &s;o ea&s;y neither," &s;aid a man in a blue coat, who was in the gallery. This, I under&s;tood afterwards, was a colonel Crawford, a brave Indian warrior of the frontiers. He had &s;ome experience of what fighting was, and an idea there might be fighting; Bradford had none.</P>
<P>Alluding to my ob&s;ervation, that I con&s;idered that what pro|perty I might have in the country as having lo&s;t half its value, on account of the di&s;turbance, Bradford u&s;ed this expre&s;&s;ion&mdash; "Da&s;tardly to talk of property, when liberty is in que&s;tion." This was contemptuous and provoking; neverthele&s;s, I did not think it prudent, on the conclu&s;ion of his &s;peech, to ri&s;e again, or to make any ob&s;ervations. I &s;aw, from the countenance of many of the committee, that they were with him.</P>
<P>Gallatin &s;poke a little; and moved to take the vote, on the propo&s;itions of the commi&s;&s;ioners. Objections were made to the taking any vote at all. The que&s;tion was then <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">&punc; Shall a vote be taken? This was negatived; not a &s;ingle per&s;o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> ri&s;ing, but the committee of twelve, who had made the report. It was again moved, on our part, to take a vote by ballot, on th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> pro|po&s;itions; pre&s;uming, that an unwillingne&s;s to let their &s;enti|ments

be known, on the &s;ubject, was the rea&s;on of objecting to the taking the vote publicly. The que&s;tion was put, Shall a private vote by ballot be taken? It was negatived; the twelve only, as before, ri&s;ing.</P>
<P>Here was a moment of delicacy indeed. The taking no vote was rejecting the propo&s;itions; and what was the con&s;equence? Mea&s;ures mu&s;t have been taken in&s;tantly, to prepare for war. B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">dford would have come forward with the &s;chedule, baffled at Pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">kin&s;on's ferry, with his heads of amm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nition, arms, mo|ney, provi&s;ions, &amp;c. Gallatin and my&s;elf would have been ar|re&s;ted, upon the &s;pot. For the example of the Terrori&s;ts, as they have been called, in France, was in the public mind, e|&s;pecially with Bradford, who had &s;ome light wandering infor|mation of French affairs, as he had of other &s;ubjects; and had heard of their arre&s;ting one another, after their debates, and cutting off heads; and coupling the &s;ucce&s;&s;es and the executions together, he would conceive the idea, that the executions pro|duced the &s;ucce&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>Gallatin, with great pre&s;ence of mind, &s;eized the moment, and propo&s;ed, that we &s;hould take a final vote, by ballot; not to be made a part of our an&s;wer to the commi&s;&s;ioners, but &s;im|ply in order to know our own minds.</P>
<P>There was he&s;itation, even at this; for every man was afraid the hand writing, even of his ballot, would be known; and by &s;ome means it might tran&s;pire, in what manner he had voted.</P>
<P>At this in&s;tant, a member of the committee ri&s;ing, and hav|ing a &s;crap of paper in his fingers, with the word Yea written one part, and the word Nay on the other, held it up, and pro|po&s;ed that 60 &s;uch &s;craps, with the words yea and nay, writ|ten in the &s;ame manner, &s;hould be made out by the &s;ecretary, and a &s;crap given to each of the members; and let every one divide his &s;crap in two parts, with the Yea on one, and the Nay on the other; and let him chew, or tear the Yea or the Nay, as he thought proper, and put the other piece into a h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t, held by the &s;ecretary. When the&s;e were drawn out, it would be &s;een, what the private &s;en&s;e of the committee was, without the po&s;&s;ibility of any one knowing how another voted. This mode was thought &s;ufficiently &s;afe, and adopted.</P>
<P>It &s;truck me greatly, to ob&s;erve the carefulne&s;s of every one, in dividing or putting in his yea or no; to conceal it. All having been put in, and the tickets drawn out, there were found 34 Yeas, and 23 Nays.</P>
<P>It verified what I had &s;tated, that the &s;entiments of a great
<PB N="118" REF="028332_0115_0FD8857467F971B8">
part were not, privately, what they publicly avowed. I mu&s;t confe&s;s, I was rather &s;urpri&s;ed, that, in a committee which had been &s;elected with great care and addre&s;s, from the general com|mittee, at Parkin&s;on's; and after the amne&s;ty offered, and the ma&s;terly rea&s;oning of Gallatin, and the direct and plain explica|tion made by me, and the peroratory &s;ermon of Edgar, there &s;hould have been &s;o many Nays. It may be &s;een, from this, what would have been the ca&s;e, if the que&s;tion of war had been &s;uffered to be directly called for, and taken, at Parkin&s;on's.</P>
<P>Bradford appeared &s;truck, on finding that the majority was with us. His countenance became dark and di&s;mayed; for I re|marked him with attention. The members that had been for war, were pretty ea&s;ily di&s;coverable, by the di&s;&s;atisfaction they evinced by the countenance, or by language. There were &s;ome of them con&s;iderably enraged. But the gallery were the mo&s;t explicit, in &s;hewing &s;atisfaction or di&s;&s;atisfaction with the vote. It was, in general, not a popular one.</P>
<P>However, it had changed the face of things; and there ap|pearing a majority in favour of adopting the propo&s;itions, it remained for the committee to go on, and make up their an&s;wer to the commi&s;&s;ioners. But having &s;at a long time, it was thought proper to adjourn, and meet again for the purpo&s;e. During the adjournment Bradford went home.</P>
<P>It may be a&s;ked me, How will I account for his conduct in coming forward with his inflammatory &s;peech? Had he con|ceived originally any project of ambition, either in &s;ubverting the government, or erecting a &s;eparate commonwealth? Not at all; he had not &s;cope of mind enough to think of either; he thought of nothing, but an exhibition of force inducing the Congre&s;s to repeal the exci&s;e law. He did not con&s;ider, that, though in &s;uch a government as the republic of Rome, where there were two di&s;tinct powers, actually in operation, the &s;e|natorial and tribunitial, the &s;ece&s;&s;ion of the people, to the Pa|latine or Aventine mount, might impo&s;e terms upon the &s;enate; and that, though in a monarchy, &s;uch as Great Britain, where the &s;tatute of the parliament is &s;ometimes the &s;tatute of the min|i&s;ter, a di&s;&s;atisfaction and di&s;turbance may alarm the mini&s;ter, for the enjoyment of his place; knowing, that the king may re|concile his &s;ubjects, by removing him; and he may u&s;e the &s;ame influence to have the law repealed, that he did to have it enacted;&mdash;but that, in our government, there was but one or|gan of the public will, the Congre&s;s; and no temporary offi|cer, on whom the odium of an unpopular law could be thrown,
<PB N="119" REF="028332_0116_0FD885AEA14BF4D0">
&s;o as &s;till to &s;ave the dignity of the enacting power. It was im|po&s;&s;ible, without &s;apping all foundation of authority, to yield to the force, not the requi&s;ition of a part.</P>
<P>Was Bradford &s;incere in conceding finally to the terms of the commi&s;&s;ioners, and engaging to go forward and advocate them with the committee? I believe he was. How then will I ac|count for his change of di&s;po&s;ition? In this manner: while the committee of conference &s;at with the commi&s;&s;ioners, at Pitt&s;|burgh, there were individuals from the country, waiting for the re&s;ult, and &s;ome occa&s;ionally in town, upon bu&s;ine&s;s, but who were &s;olicitious to know what was done. It had tran&s;pired, therefore, that "we were to &s;ubmit to the exci&s;e law." This was carried to the country, and produced a flame. It was &s;aid that the commi&s;&s;ioners had brought up gold, that I had got e|nough to make it unnece&s;&s;ary for me to plead law any more. I had heard &s;o much of this, that in riding to Brown&s;ville with the report, and pa&s;&s;ing through the Mingo creek &s;ettlement, I made ha&s;te, apprehen&s;ive that I might be &s;topped, and the re|port taken from me. Bradford had gone to Wa&s;hington, and finding how the current ran, he denied that he had acquie&s;ced, and laid the blame on Gallatin and me. Yet he had not intend|ed to take any active part in oppo&s;ing, but &s;imply to glide with the current, until he went to Brown&s;ville, and &s;aw the unfav|ourable manner in which the report was received the fir&s;t day; nor even then had he not perfectly made up his mind, until in the committee, a &s;hort time before he &s;poke, when two of the members urged him, &s;aying, Will Brackenridge and Gallatin run us intirely down? Can we have nothing to &s;ay on this &s;ide? This information I have from James Alli&s;on, his brother-in-law, a judge of the court of Wa&s;hington, to whom Bradford ac|knowledged it, before he went away. I am the more inclined to believe this, from recollecting an ob&s;ervation of Bradford to me at Parkin&s;on's ferry, when I mentioned to him, that the march to Braddock's field had been a ra&s;h act; he laid it upon the people; and &s;aid that Mar&s;hall had nearly ruined him&s;elf by retracting, but that he had &s;aved him&s;elf by falling in with them. In &s;hort, I knew him to entertain the idea, that it was &s;afe&s;t always to &s;tand with the people, not di&s;tingui&s;hing in this ca&s;e, who were the people. If this country had been lopped off from the world, it would have been all well enough.</P>
<P>It may be a&s;ked, Was he a man of eloquence? Could his harangue have &s;uch effect? It &s;erved to give a face to an oppo|&s;ition, and doubtle&s;s prevented the general acquie&s;cence. Had
<PB N="120" REF="028332_0117_0FD898F98594B9E8">
he taken a contrary part, he would have lo&s;t popularity, for the time; but there would have been no thought of further re|&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>The committee having met, the que&s;tion now was, Whether more favourable terms might not be obtained from the commi&s;|&s;ioners; or at lea&s;t time to convene the original meeting of de|puties at Parkin&s;on's ferry, in order to lay the propo&s;itions be|fore them. It was well known to tho&s;e who had been of the committee of 12, that no better terms could be obtained. We were doubtful that the commi&s;&s;ioners would not wait for a con|vention of the deputies, at Parkin&s;on's, after a di&s;&s;ent of &s;o con|&s;iderable minority of the &s;tanding committee; neverthele&s;s, in order to &s;atisfy the people, as to the fir&s;t, and to leave it to the commi&s;&s;ioners, as to the la&s;t, it was perfectly agreeable to us, that a new committee &s;hould be appointed, to wait upon the commi&s;&s;ioners. It would at lea&s;t &s;u&s;pend the expectation of the people, and prevent any violent mea&s;ures being adopted in the mean time. Accordingly it was approved, on our part, that a new committee of conference &s;hould be appointed.</P>
<P>A new committee of 12 was appointed, three from each county, and the &s;tanding committee adjourned without day.</P>
<P>No gallery, or little, had attended in the afternoon. On going out I &s;aw clubs, and clu&s;ters of tho&s;e, who had been the gallery, in private and clo&s;e conver&s;ation in different places. Pa&s;&s;ing by &s;ome of them, I &s;poke with confidence, as if I &s;u&s;|pected nothing; but was received with &s;ilence, and with looks of indignity. Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e were per&s;ons, who were at that time, my clients, in cau&s;es of moment, and whom I had &s;erved with &s;uc|ce&s;s in former ca&s;es, and with whom I had been long in ha|bits of attachment; yet notwith&s;tanding every lien of amity, they behaved to me in this manner: A man, whom I had brought with me from Pitt&s;burgh, to carry the copies of the report, a few hundred of which had been printed, gave me to under&s;tand, that from what he could over-hear, there was &s;omething on foot. I gave him money to di&s;charge my bill at the public hou&s;e, and as &s;peedily as I could, without &s;eeming to be in ha&s;te, cro&s;&s;ed the river; my hor&s;es had been left in a pa&s;|ture, on that &s;ide; I a&s;&s;i&s;ted a lad in driving them up, brid|led them, and had them &s;addled, and was ready to mount, when the man, whom I had left, had got over. Some per&s;ons had cro&s;&s;ed over with him; among&s;t the&s;e were four of the Alleghe|ny members of the committee. It was then dark; we rode eighteen miles that night, and got through the bulk of the Min|go creek &s;ettlement.</P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="028332_0118_0FD88575E65A5430">I have learnt &s;ince, that nothing but a want of deci&s;ion, pre|vented them from arre&s;ting me, after my &s;peech, in the fore|noon. It was in agitation, but they wavered in attempting it. The going away of Bradford al&s;o di&s;couraged them. They had talked of arre&s;ting Gallatin, but his &s;peech had been more ab|&s;tract and guarded, and had not given &s;o much offence as mine. It was in agitation, &s;ome days after this, to take him, and a body of men had actually collected at Fredericktown, on the we&s;t of the Monongahela, for that purpo&s;e. They were di&s;|&s;uaded by per&s;ons who went over from Fayette county, and who endeavoured to remove their mi&s;conceptions.</P>
<P>In our company that night, of the four Allegheny members that were along, was one of the name of Miller. When he fir&s;t joined us, I was &s;u&s;picious of him, knowing that he had been a principal, in the two attacks upon the hou&s;e of the in|&s;pector, and commanding a company upon Peter's creek, in a &s;ettlement through which we had to pa&s;s. I did not know but he might have been di&s;patched with orders to arre&s;t me, as I went through. I communicated this to &s;ome of the other mem|bers in the company; and we took care to ride fa&s;t enough not to put it in his power to be much a-head of us. He lodged with us, where we halted a few hours, and &s;lept on the planks, at the hou&s;e of a German.</P>
<P>In the morning when we had &s;et out, which was early, on our way, I kept clo&s;e by him, and fell into conver&s;ation. He had been in the American &s;ervice during the war with Great Britain; had been employed chiefly in the we&s;tern country, in the war again&s;t the Indians. Had di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf for fi|delity, activity, and bravery, on every occa&s;ion. I led him to talk of his &s;ervices, and he gave the hi&s;tory of a variety of inci|dents. Sliding gradually from thence, I touched upon the pre|&s;ent affairs of the country; the coming of the mar&s;hal, the oppo|&s;ition to him, the attack upon the hou&s;e of the in&s;pector, &amp;c. I knew he had been one of the delinquent di&s;tillers, and that it was on leaving his hou&s;e, after having &s;erved a writ, that the mar&s;hal had been fired upon; which was the fir&s;t oppo&s;ition he had met with, in the &s;ervice of proce&s;s. Miller gave me, with frankne&s;s, a relation of the whole circum&s;tances. The federal &s;heriff, &s;aid he, was reading the writ, and general Neville was on hor&s;eback in the lane, when he called to the &s;heriff to make ha&s;te. I looked up, and &s;aw a party of men running acro&s;s the field, as it were to head the &s;heriff. He &s;et off with general Neville, and when they got to the head of the lane, the people
<PB N="122" REF="028332_0119_0FD898FDF3168978">
fired upon them. Do you think, &s;aid I, they fired with balls, and meant to hit them? Said he, I believe they meant to hit them; they pur&s;ued them, and would have killed them.</P>
<P>That night, continued Miller, it was concluded that we would go on to Neville's, and take him and the mar&s;hal. I felt my|&s;elf mad with pa&s;&s;ion. I thought 250 dollars would ruin me; and to have to go the federal court, at Philadelphia, would keep me from going to Kentucky this fall, after I had &s;old my plantation, and was getting ready <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This was one of the men that was thought might be depended upon, in ca&s;e of a war.</NOTE>. I felt my blood boil, at &s;eeing general Neville along, to pilot the &s;heriff to my very door. He had been again&s;t the exci&s;e law as much as any body. When old Graham, the exci&s;e man, was catched, and had his hair cut off, I heard general Neville him&s;elf &s;ay, they ought to have cut off the ears of the old ra&s;cal; and when the di&s;tillers were &s;ued, &s;ome years ago, for fines, he talked as much again&s;t it as any body. But he wanted to keep in the a&s;&s;embly then. But whenever he got an offer of the office him&s;elf, he took it. I am a relation of Kirkpatrick, his mother and my mother were &s;i&s;ters; I was always for general Neville, in his elections; and it put me mad to &s;ee him coming to ruin me.</P>
<P>I de&s;ired him to give me the particulars of the attack upon Neville's hou&s;e, the fir&s;t day. He did &s;o: he &s;aid they had a|bout thirty men, with fifteen guns, &s;ix only in order. They found the general ju&s;t got up; after &s;ome words, he fired fir&s;t. It was from the windows. A horn was blowing in the hou&s;e, the time of the firing. Was the door open? &s;aid I. It was, &s;aid he. Why then did you not ru&s;h into the entry? We were afraid, &s;aid he, that he had a &s;wivel, or a big gun there&punc;</P>
<P>The negroes, continued Miller, by this time, fired out of their cabins upon our backs, and &s;hot &s;everal; and we got off as well as we could.</P>
<P>Well, what now; are you for war? No, &s;aid he, I voted for peace; but if I was to acknowledge that, I need never go home. I will have to deny it; and I will have to do whatever my company will in&s;i&s;t upon me doing now. But I expect to get away &s;oon, and to be clear of it.</P>
<P>By this time, we had arrived at his hou&s;e, about eight miles from Pitt&s;burgh. As we came up, three pretty children pre|&s;ented them&s;elves, in the in&s;ide of the fence that enclo&s;ed the cabin; and one of them &s;aid, putting his fingers between the

I was &s;en&s;ibly af|fected with the reflection, that po&s;&s;ibly that daddy might come to be hanged, and that brother fatherle&s;s, before it could know that it ever had one.</P>
<P>The new committee of conference met at Pitt&s;burgh, on the fir&s;t of September. Nine only attended. They reque&s;ted a more general and explicit relinqui&s;hment of arrearages; and demanded until the 11th of October, to take the &s;en&s;e of the people.</P>
<P>The commi&s;&s;ioners could not relax, in a &s;ingle particular, from their former propo&s;itions. But, con&s;idering the &s;tipula|lations with the former committee of conference as at an end, there not being a pro&s;pect of that general &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, on which the amne&s;ty was to depend, yet willing to grant it to tho&s;e who were di&s;po&s;ed to &s;ubmit, they propo&s;ed a mode of taking the &s;en&s;e of the country, and putting it in the power of every indivi|dual to &s;ave him&s;elf; viz. that on the 11th of September, any man, in his di&s;trict, &s;hould &s;ub&s;cribe his name to a paper, declaring his willingne&s;s to yield obedience to the law, and faithfully pro|mi&s;ing acquie&s;cence for the future.</P>
<P>The nece&s;&s;ity of individually &s;igning, would be con&s;idered by the people as humiliating; neverthele&s;s, it became nece&s;&s;ary now, under a pro&s;pect of war, in order to enable the gov|ernment to di&s;tingui&s;h the penitent or peaceable, from the ob|&s;tinate or refractory. But an advantage was gained, as the am|ne&s;ty was made to depend upon the conduct of the individual him&s;elf, and not upon the peace being kept by the whole coun|try.</P>
<P>Alexander Addi&s;on, pre&s;ident of the di&s;trict on the we&s;t of the mountains, had arrived at Pitt&s;burgh, before this time. He had been returning from the court of errors and appeals, at Philadelphia; but hearing of the per&s;onal prejudice again&s;t him, of which commi&s;&s;ioner Ro&s;s, after con&s;ultation with me, had in|formed him by letter, he had remained at Bedford, at the di&s;|tance of 105 miles from Pitt&s;burgh. I had, in the mean time, ventured to write to him, recommending the coming directly to Pitt&s;burgh; but not to his re&s;idence at Wa&s;hington. The let|ter had pa&s;&s;ed him on the way; for he had adopted, from his own reflections, a re&s;olution, the &s;ame that I had &s;ugge&s;ted, and had come on to Pitt&s;burgh. Meeting here with gentlemen from Wa&s;hington, and a pacification being now agreed upon, he thought it &s;afe to go on to Wa&s;hington. He went; and had
<PB N="124" REF="028332_0121_0FD89901B5D21F38">
been pre&s;ent at the meeting at Brown&s;ville. He had returned from Wa&s;hington, and was now in Pitt&s;burgh. In the mean time, having con&s;iderably allayed the prejudice again&s;t him&s;elf, by his conver&s;ation with the people; by a candid &s;tatement of his conduct, viz. that on his way to Philadelphia, he had met with the mar&s;hal, and gave it as his opinion to him, that he would meet with no in&s;ult in the execution of his duty; and this was the confidence that he had in the rea&s;on of the people, at the time, and it was unfortunate that he had found him&s;elf mi&s;taken. Judge Addi&s;on, al&s;o, was active in conciliating to an acceptance of the propo&s;itions of the commi&s;&s;ioners.</P>
<P>The court of Allegheny, to be held the fir&s;t Monday in Sep|tember, was now to be opened. It was a que&s;tion, whether it was be&s;t to be opened at all, or not? It was &s;ugge&s;ted, that that the &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of ju&s;tice might &s;trike the public mind, with view of the lurid &s;tate of things; like the interdict of the pope, on the performance of religious rites, in the catholic countries. It did not appear to me, that it would di&s;plea&s;e generally, but rather plea&s;e, as a liberation from the re&s;traint of law; and leading to a wi&s;h, with the mo&s;t violent, that it &s;hould always remain &s;o.</P>
<P>The court was opened; but it was a que&s;tion, whether the grand jury &s;hould be charged with the pre&s;ent merits of the of|fences lately committed in the country, in oppo&s;ition to the ex|ci&s;e law. The chief ju&s;tice and judge Yates were con&s;ulted by judge Addi&s;on, and it was thought advi&s;eable, that they &s;hould not; as an amne&s;ty, under conditions of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, was in offer to the country; and it could not be known who would avail them&s;elves of it.</P>
<P>Such was the &s;tate of things, when the commi&s;&s;ioners, both of the United States and of the &s;tate of Penn&s;ylvania, having done all that was in their power to do, left the country. And here I cannot deny my&s;elf the plea&s;ure, of expre&s;&s;ing the &s;en|&s;ibility with which I then felt, and do now feel, the patience, the mildne&s;s, and the philo&s;ophy, di&s;covered by the commi&s;&s;ion|ers, both on the part of the United States, and of the &s;tate of Penn&s;ylvania, in hearing every thing, in conceding every thing that was tolerable or practicable, in our negociation; their &s;o|licitude to &s;ave the people here from de&s;truction, and the gov|ernment from embarra&s;&s;ment; their thoughts to be in union with us, I &s;peak of tho&s;e of us, and the greater part of the twelve conferees were &s;uch, as had the &s;ame &s;ingle point in view, to heal the mi&s;chiefs of the country.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<P>FROM the temper of the country, I was not without appre|hen&s;ions that the commi&s;&s;ioners might be in&s;ulted on their return. It had not been thought &s;afe for them to go to Brown&s;|ville, and be pre&s;ent at the deliberations of the &s;tanding com|mittee. I found that it would not have been &s;afe for the chief ju&s;tice, a commi&s;&s;ioner on the part of Penn&s;ylvania, to have gone. It had been carried to the country, by individuals oc|ca&s;ionally in town, that the chief ju&s;tice was very rigid in the management of the negociation; and particularly in&s;i&s;ted up|on having the recalling the exiled, made an article of agree|ment with the commi&s;&s;ioners. This, doubtle&s;s, had been urged by the chief ju&s;tice; but relinqui&s;hed, on our ob&s;erving, that the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion on the part of the country, which was &s;tipulated, as the condition of the amne&s;ty, drew with it, nece&s;&s;arily, the di&s;continuance of all per&s;onal violence; and that the return of the&s;e per&s;ons would be of cour&s;e, without &s;aying any thing a|bout it; that the idea of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion it&s;elf, would be &s;ufficiently difficult of dige&s;tion, even though not accompanied with any o|ther circum&s;tance, at which the mind would revolt.</P>
<P>At Green&s;burgh, the &s;eat of ju&s;tice of We&s;tmoreland, a ri|oter had the impertinence to charge the &s;ervant of the chief ju&s;tice with &s;tealing his boots and &s;purs, and, under this pre|tence, had collected a party, to attack the hou&s;e in which the commi&s;&s;ioners lodged. They were trouble&s;ome, during the

greate&s;t part of the night. A liberty-pole &s;tood near the hou&s;e, and creeping up, they would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> them&s;elves behind this, and give abu&s;ive language. They threw &s;tones at the hou&s;e, and broke the gla&s;s of &s;ome of the windows. The commi&s;&s;ioners were armed with pi&s;tols, and &s;tood on their defence. The par|ty had been intoxicated, and were not heard of in the morning.</P>
<P>It was unfortunate, that, at this time, the &s;pirit of in&s;ur|rection, on the ea&s;t of the mountains, had &s;hewn it&s;elf in the midland parts of Penn&s;ylvania, and in the upper parts of Mary|land; and whatever of it did exi&s;t, was greatly exaggerated by intelligence. Every one that came to our country, gave the mo&s;t flattering accounts of the congeniality of temper el&s;e|where, with the people here. They brought me&s;&s;ages in real|ity, or pretended to bring me&s;&s;ages, de&s;iring the country to &s;tand out. This had a mo&s;t unfavourable effect, in prejudicing the public mind again&s;t a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion.</P>

<P>BROTHERS, we welcome you to the old council fire at this place.&mdash;It is a lucky &s;pot of ground for holding Indian treaties. No good has attended your treaties at Beaver creek, Mu&s;hingum, &amp;c. As the proffer of this treaty has originated with your great council at Philadelphia, we therefore expect you have good terms to offer. But you know, brothers, that it ever has been a cu&s;tom, to pay Indians well for coming to treaties; and you may be a&s;&s;ured, that unle&s;s we are well paid, or <HI>fully &s;atisfied,</HI> your <HI>attempts, of any kind,</HI> will have not the lea&s;t effect.&mdash;However, we doubt not but the pay is provided; and that you have a &s;ufficiency of blankets and breech-clouts, powder and lead; and that the waggons are clo&s;e at hand. You know, brothers, that our neighbours the Briti&s;h, over the lakes, pay their Indians well; that they have inexhau&s;tible &s;tores of blankets and ammunition, and that if they were offering us a treaty, they would not he&s;itate a moment to &s;atisfy all our demands.</P>

<HEAD>Captain WHISKEY &s;poke next.&mdash;</HEAD>
<P>Brothers&mdash;My friend captain Blanket has indulged him&s;elf in a little drol|lery about blankets, &amp;c. but I mu&s;t &s;peak to the point.&mdash;I am told, that the people of your great council call us a parcel of drunken raggamuffins; be|cau&s;e we indulge our&s;elves with a little of our home&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> whi&s;key; and that we ought to pay well for this extraordinary luxury. What would they think, if the &s;ame was &s;aid of them, for drinking beer and cyder? Surely the &s;ay|ing will apply with equal force, in both ca&s;es. We &s;ay that our whi&s;key &s;hall not be &s;addled with an unequal tax&mdash;You &s;ay it &s;hall: and to enforce the collection of three or four thou&s;and dollars per annum, of nett proceeds, you will &s;end an army of 12,950 men, or double that number, if nece&s;&s;ary. This is a new fa&s;hioned kind of economy indeed. It is a pity that this ar|my had not been employed long ago, in a&s;&s;i&s;ting your old warrior, general <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ay<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e&punc; or cha&s;ti&s;ing the Briti&s;h about the lakes. However, I pre&s;ume it i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the pre&s;ent policy, to guard again&s;t offending a nation with a king at their head. But remember, brothers, if we have not a king at our head, we have that powerful monarch, captain Whi&s;key, to command us. By the power of his influence, and a love to <HI>his per&s;on,</HI> we are impelled to every great and heroic act. You know, brothers, that captain Whi&s;key has been a great warrio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, in all nations, and in all armies. He is a de&s;cendent of that nation called Ireland&punc; and, to u&s;e his own phra&s;e, he has peopled three-fourths of this we&s;tern world with his own hand. We, the Six United Nations of White Indians, are principally his legitimate offspring; and tho&s;e who are not, have all imbibed his principles and pa&s;&s;ions&mdash;that is, a love of whi&s;key; and will, therefore, fight for our bottle till the la&s;t ga&s;p. Brothers, you mu&s;t not think to frighten us with fine arranged li&s;ts of infantry, cavalry, and artillery, compo&s;ed of your water-melon armies from the Jer&s;ey &s;hore; they would cut a much better figure, in warring with the crabs and oy&s;ters, about the capes of Delaware. It is a common thing for Indians, to fight your be&s;t armies at the proportion of one to five; therefore, we would not he&s;i|tate a moment to attack this army at the rate of one to ten. Our nations can, upon an emergency, produce twenty thou&s;and warriors; you may then calculate what your army ought to be.

<HEAD>Captain ALLIANCE next took the floor.&mdash;</HEAD>
<P>Brothers&mdash;My friend, captain Whi&s;key, has made &s;ome fine flouri&s;hes a|bout the power of his all conquering monarch, Whi&s;key; and of the intre|pidity of the &s;ons of St. Patrick, in du<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">e of their beloved bottle. But we will &s;uppo&s;e, when matters are brought to the te&s;t, that, if we &s;hould find our&s;elves unequal to the ta&s;k of repelling this tremendous army, or that the great council will &s;till per&s;evere in their determination, of impo&s;ing unequal and oppre&s;&s;ive duties upon our whi&s;key, who knows but &s;ome <HI>evil &s;pirit</HI> might prompt us to a &s;eparation from the union, and call for the alliance of &s;ome more friendly nation. You know that the great nation of Kentucky, have already &s;ugge&s;ted the idea to us. They are at pre&s;ent Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi mad, and we are whi&s;key mad&punc; it is, therefore, hard to tell what may be the i&s;|&s;ue of &s;uch united madne&s;s. It appears as if the Kentuckians were di&s;po&s;ed to bow the knee to the Spani&s;h monarch, or ki&s;s the pope's a&mdash;e, and wear a crucifix, rather than be longer deprived of their darling Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi: and we might be de&s;perate enough, rather than &s;ubmit to an odious exci&s;e, or unequal taxes, to invite Prince William Henry, or &s;ome other royal pup, to take us by the hand, provided he would guarantee equal taxation, and exempt our whi&s;key. This would be a plea&s;ing overture to the royal family of England; they would eagerly embrace the favourable moment, to add again to their curtailed dominions in America, to accommodate &s;ome of their numerous brood with kingdoms and principalities. We would &s;oon find that great warrior of the lakes, Simcoe, flying to our relief, and em|ploying tho&s;e numerous legions of white and yellow &s;avages, for a very dif|ferent purpo&s;e to what they have now in view. If the Kentuckians &s;hould al&s;o take it into their heads, to withhold &s;upplies from your good old war|rior Wayne, who is very often near &s;tarving in the wilderne&s;s, his army mu&s;t be immediately annihilated, and your great council might for ever bid adieu to their territory we&s;t of the mountains. This may &s;eem very improba|ble indeed; but as great wonders have happened in Europe, within the cour&s;e of three years pa&s;t.</P>

<P>Brothers&mdash;My friend Alliance has made &s;ome very alarming ob&s;ervations; and I confe&s;s they have con&s;iderable weight with me. A de&s;perate people may be drove to de&s;perate re&s;ources; but as I am of a peaceable di&s;po&s;ition&punc; I &s;hall readily concur in every rea&s;onable propo&s;ition, which may have a ten|dency to re&s;tore tranquility, and &s;ecure our union upon the true principles of equality and ju&s;tice. It is now time to know the true object of your mi&s;&s;ion; if you are the me&s;&s;enger of peace, and come to offer us a treaty, why attempt to deliver it at the point of the bayonet. If you are only come to grant pardons for pa&s;t offences&punc; you need not have fatigued your&s;elf with &s;uch extraordinary di&s;patch on the journey; we have not yet begged your pardon; we are not yet at the gallows, or the guillotine, for you will have to catch us before you bring us there.

<P>John Ga&s;ton, the per&s;on who brought Tom the Tinker's letter to the printer, was a client of mine, in an ejectment brought for him again&s;t a certain M'Clure.

It may be, &s;aid I, there is no help for it; that is all that can be done now; at lea&s;t until &s;ome other government, and other courts of law, are &s;et up, in the place of tho&s;e that are overthrown <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">If this language to John Ga&s;ton had tran&s;pired, and he had come for|ward and &s;tated it, the quo animo with which I &s;poke being out of view, it would have been &s;trong evidence of my in&s;urgency.</NOTE>.

while again&s;t the committee of conference, he would re|turn to the que&s;tion, "When will my cau&s;e with M'Clure come to trial?" I mention this incident, to &s;hew the indi&s;tinct conception, on the part of the people, of the connection between the &s;tate government and the federal. Though laws of the &s;tate are not the laws of the union, yet the laws of the union are laws of the &s;tate. I &s;carcely ever met with a man, that I could get to comprehend this.</P>
<P>On the fir&s;t of September, Alexander Addi&s;on, the pre&s;ident of the court, delivered an excellent charge to the grand jury of Allegheny county. It was publi&s;hed in the Pitt&s;burgh Ga|zette, of the 6th of September; and has been &s;ince republi&s;hed in mo&s;t of the gazettes of the United States. However excel|lent, yet the grand jury could not be brought to approve of it. It appeared in the paper, with the following note.</P>
<P><Q>The above &s;entiments of peace and obedience to the laws, would have received the &s;anction of the grand jury, but a few members declined their a&s;&s;ent; &s;ilence was thought bet|ter, than an approbation not unanimous.</Q></P>
<P>This was the be&s;t apology that could be made, and putting the be&s;t face on it. The grand jury, though &s;ummoned by a &s;heriff well di&s;po&s;ed, and them&s;elves chiefly well di&s;po&s;ed, yet were under &s;uch apprehen&s;ions from the country, as not to think it &s;afe to manife&s;t an approbation of the &s;entiments contained in the charge.</P>
<P>The language of individuals, from the country, had all along from the commencement of the di&s;turbances, been highly con|tumelious, and we where con&s;tantly threatened with Tom the Tinker. The &s;y&s;tem of tolerance and conciliation had been that, which we had hitherto pur&s;ued; we had thought it pru|dent to u&s;e the utmo&s;t policy, from the fir&s;t, to ma&s;k our &s;en|timents, and to &s;ave our&s;elves from the odium that exi&s;ted a|gain&s;t the town. To give an in&s;tance which I have omitted in my narrative, I think it was after the affair of Braddock's fields: A man came to me from the country, and mention|ed the circum&s;tance of one of the men, who had been wounded at the attack of Neville's hou&s;e the fir&s;t day, being at the hou&s;e of a doctor in the neighbourhood, who was to take care of him, on principles of humanity, for that the man him&s;elf had nothing in the world; that the congregation of the rev. Mr. Clerk had propo&s;ed to rai&s;e a collection for him, to help to &s;ub&s;i&s;t him, and to pay the doctor. That it would have a good effect in the country, and allay the fury again&s;t the
<PB N="11" REF="028332_0128_0FD899159332FA60">
town, if we were to rai&s;e &s;omething for the wounded man. I thought &s;o; and &s;poke to a per&s;on to go about to collect, and gave half a dollar my&s;elf. I did it on the double prin|ciple of humanity, and the policy &s;ugge&s;ted. I always won|dered that this circum&s;tance was not brought forward again&s;t me, as a proof that I was an in&s;urgent. I never heard it men|tioned.</P>
<P>The union of the people being now broken by the propo&s;i|tions of the commi&s;&s;ioners, and a &s;tandard erected, round which tho&s;e, oppo&s;ed to the in&s;urrection, could rally. It was &s;ugge&s;|ted, as advi&s;eable for the town of Pitt&s;burgh, to a&s;&s;ociate and form a &s;y&s;tem of defence; to protect again&s;t the in&s;ults of indi|viduals, or an attack by the in&s;urgents, &s;hould any part of the country be finally di&s;po&s;ed to go to war again&s;t the government. General Wilkins thought it might be now &s;afe to take a &s;tep of this nature. I doubted it, not with regard to the expediency of an a&s;&s;ociation to protect again&s;t the in&s;ults of individuals, but with regard to the holding out the idea of protecting again&s;t the country, &s;hould any part of it embody in arms again&s;t the government; I had doubts of the prudence of &s;uch a mea&s;ure. It might put it into the minds of the country to come and at|tack the town, when otherwi&s;e they would not perhaps have thought of it. It might be be&s;t to continue, for &s;ome time, our &s;y&s;tem of conciliation, and affect to repo&s;e a confidence in the good di&s;po&s;ition of the people towards us. I was not &s;ure, if the country &s;hould go to war, what proportion of the town would go with it. It might be well enough to wait the re&s;ult of the taking the &s;en&s;e of the people, on the 11th of the month, as propo&s;ed by the commi&s;&s;ioners, before we entered on a &s;tep of this nature. However, General Wilkins had lo&s;t patience, and &s;aid, he would lo&s;e his life, rather than to be bullied any longer. I yielded, contrary to my judgment, and propo&s;ed the calling a town-meeting and explaining the rea&s;ons for the mea|&s;ure, and taking their &s;en&s;e upon it.</P>
<P>A town-meeting was called, accordingly, on the 6th of Sep|tember. It was opened by me, taking a view, in a &s;peech of con&s;iderable length, of what had taken place &s;ince the commence|ment of the in&s;urrection; the principles of the policy, which it had been nece&s;&s;ary for the town of Pitt&s;burgh, to adopt; the change which had taken place, in the &s;ituation of affairs, and the probable &s;afety now of avowing real &s;entiments; and the po&s;&s;ible expediency of a&s;&s;ociating for the purpo&s;e of defence, in
<PB N="12" REF="028332_0129_0FD89916B440A1F8">
ca&s;e of in&s;ult from individuals of the country, or an attack from a body in arms, &s;hould a war be contemplated.</P>
<P>I &s;aw in&s;tantly, that this idea produced a revul&s;ion in the minds of the people. It &s;truck &s;ome, as un&s;afe to &s;et the coun|try at defiance; and probably others, as ineligible, becau&s;e they meant at all events to &s;tand with it.</P>
<P>General Wilkins &s;upported the expediency and nece&s;&s;ity of a&s;&s;ociating; however it did not appear to go down with the meeting. There was a vi&s;ible reluctance. On this I &s;ugge&s;ted a po&s;tponement for the purpo&s;e of con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>The meeting broke-up. In the evening, General Wilkin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> with a number of gentlemen met in a public hou&s;e, and a not<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> was &s;ent, reque&s;ting my company, in order to deliberate on the &s;ubject of an a&s;&s;ociation. We met; and as before, I expre&s;&s;ed my doubts as to the expedience of an a&s;&s;ociation, bringing ex|pre&s;ly into view a defence again&s;t the country, &s;hould it embo|dy in arms, to attack the town. If a war &s;hould en&s;ue, there was no manner of que&s;tion, but that the garri&s;on would be the fir&s;t object; the town could &s;upport it very little; and the gar|ri&s;on could not &s;upport the town at all. The town might be &s;afe by lying by and remaining quiet. That for my part, if a war &s;hould en&s;ue, it was probable I &s;hould quit the country, and not con&s;ider my&s;elf as bound by any a&s;&s;ociation to remain and defend the town. However, if it was thought advi&s;eable to a&s;&s;ociate at all, it might be under an idea of defending again&s;t banditti, and &s;mall parties, who, for the &s;ake of plunder, might be di&s;po&s;ed to come again&s;t us.</P>
<P>This idea met with approbation, and an a&s;&s;ociation was drawn upon that principle, with all po&s;&s;ible caution. It was as far as appeared prudent to go at that time <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>WHEREAS by the committees appointed, on the part of the people to con|fer with commi&s;&s;ioners on the part of the union and the &s;tate of Penn&s;ylvania, certain propo&s;itions have been agreed upon, and recommended to the peo|ple, viz. an amne&s;ty or oblivion of offences in the violation of the laws, with other<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> accommodations and beneficial arrangements; re&s;erving the con|&s;titutional right of remon&s;trating, and pur&s;uing, at all times, a redre&s;s of grievances.

<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<P>I HAD now &s;et out to attend the court of We&s;tmoreland, at the &s;eat of ju&s;tice at Green&s;burgh. The &s;tate of the public mind in this county was, as el&s;ewhere, unfavourable to &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. The &s;ame charge, with additions, was deliver<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> by Judge Addi&s;on, here, as at Pitt&s;burgh, but I recollect no reply or approbation of the grand jury. The election for a member of Congre&s;s, and for the &s;tate legi&s;lature was approaching, and the people talked fa|miliarly of re&s;i&s;ting, and yet electing. The tide of popularity had not ebbed &s;o far again&s;t me, in that quarter, being remote from Brown&s;ville, where I had declared my&s;elf. Application were made to me to let my name run for Congre&s;s, in that di&s;trict, as they were di&s;&s;atisfied with Findley, on account of his recommending it to them, to &s;ubmit to the laws. They con|&s;idered it as &s;trangely incon&s;i&s;tent, that he &s;hould have been &s;peaking and writing again&s;t the law, and &s;hould, all at once, turn round, and be in favour of it. Having had a political difference with Findley, which had become per&s;onal, I might have been di&s;po&s;ed, on a le&s;s delicate occa&s;ion, to improve the prejudice again&s;t him; and it might have been amu&s;ing to have taken advantage of the adver&s;e gale to fail by him, in a popular vote, in his own di&s;trict. But it mu&s;t have been at the expen&s;e of the people and my&s;elf, in an e&s;&s;ential point of allegiance and fi|delity, to have availed my&s;elf of this error of the people at the time; I had therefore to ju&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">fy Findley, in his recommendation to them, to &s;ubmit. This had a good effect; for, if &s;o &s;trong an adver&s;ary to Findley, as they conceived me to be, and with the offer of a &s;eat in Congre&s;s again&s;t him, neverthele&s;s &s;up|ported the &s;ame &s;entiments, which were rendering him unpopu|lar; the&s;e &s;entiments mu&s;t be right, and for their intere&s;t.</P>
<P>During the fitting of the court, great pains were taken to in|form the people and per&s;uade them. The &s;econd evening, all that were attending, were convened and harangued by Findley, and by gentlemen of the bar of that county. The di&s;po&s;ition appeared to have become general, to &s;ubmit; that is, to make a declaration of committing no outrrge, for the future, upon
<PB N="15" REF="028332_0132_0FD8991B84229BE8">
officers of the revenue. But there was a reluctance at the idea of &s;igning the words in the form of the commi&s;&s;ioners.</P>
<P>In the evening of the third day, I under&s;tood that a young man, by the name of Parker, who re&s;ided in We&s;tmoreland, was about &s;etting out from Green&s;burgh, to his father's fami|ly, near Parkin&s;on's ferry, in the county of Wa&s;hington, in or|der to inform them of the general di&s;po&s;ition to &s;ubmit, in his county, and induce them to &s;ign, and to take advantage of the amne&s;ty; as &s;everal of his brothers had been involved in the af|fair of Neville's hou&s;e. It &s;truck me, at the moment, that it would be rendering an e&s;&s;ential &s;ervice to humanity, and to the object of compo&s;ing the country, if that &s;ettlement, from which the in&s;urrection &s;prung, could be brought to &s;ubmit. I reflect|ed, that my apprehen&s;ions at Brown&s;ville, might have been, in &s;ome degree, imaginary; but, if not, by this time the pub|lic mind might have cooled a little, and rea&s;on have begun to take place; and that this young man, coming from We&s;tmore|land, and informing them of a di&s;po&s;ition, in that county, to &s;ubmit, the fear of being left by them&s;elves would take place, and reduce their violence. I felt a pa&s;&s;ion, at the moment, of ri&s;king my own &s;afety, to a&s;&s;i&s;t in accompli&s;hing this object; and propo&s;ed to the court, to excu&s;e my attendance, and I would ride into the Parkin&s;on's ferry &s;ettlement. The di&s;tance to Parkin&s;on's ferry, was about 25 miles. Having &s;et out, and cro&s;&s;ed the Youghageny river, in the night, we halted, and went to &s;leep, for &s;ome hours, in the ferry hou&s;e. Setting out, we arrived at the Monongahela, oppo&s;ite Parkin&s;on's fer|ry, early in the day. Enquiring of the keeper of the ferry, of the name of Devore, with regard to the &s;entiments of the country, he referred us to a major Scott, who was &s;tanding by, loading his rifle. I was over, &s;aid major Scott, the other day, on Mingo creek, when there were about 200 pre&s;ent, and they all, to a man, pledged them&s;elves not to &s;ign, and to &s;hoot any man that will. I am going to the meeting in the forks of the rivers, and I will take care that nobody &s;hall &s;ign there.</P>
<P>I was &s;ilent; and cro&s;&s;ed the river. When on the other &s;ide, I addre&s;&s;ed the young man, and ob&s;erved, that, from this ac|count of major Scott, I thought it dangerous for my&s;elf to go further; I would take the road directly down the river, and make my way to Pitt&s;burgh. He &s;ugge&s;ted the enquiring at the ferry hou&s;e of Parkin&s;on, who was a brother to Benjamin, and hearing what intelligence there. We did &s;o; and had a contrary information, that the people were di&s;po&s;ed to &s;ubmit.
<PB N="16" REF="028332_0133_0FD8992060198398">
On this, it was &s;ugge&s;ted by the young man, to ride on to the hou&s;e of Benjamin Parkin&s;on; about a mile a-head. I he&s;ita|ted; informing him, that I knew of but two men in the &s;ettle|ment, who had any predi&s;po&s;ition to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate me; and that Benjamin Parkin&s;on was one of them; Andrew M'Farlane the other. He urged me with great earne&s;tne&s;s, and pledged him|&s;elf to lo&s;e his life before I &s;hould lo&s;e mine. I rode on.</P>
<P>Coming oppo&s;ite to the hou&s;e, and having leapt over a &s;mall pair of bars, into the yard, I was &s;truck with a hor&s;e &s;tanding &s;addled, and a rifle, at the door. I took it, that Benjamin Parkin&s;on was &s;etting out for the place of meeting, for the purpo&s;e of taking the &s;en&s;e of the people that day; and the tak|ing his rifle with him, was no good &s;ymptom of a di&s;po&s;ition for &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Alighting, and entering the hou&s;e to an inner apartment, I was all at once appalled, with the &s;ight of Benjamin Parkin&s;on and Andrew M'Farlane together; Andrew M'Farlane with a rifle &s;tanding by him. I was &s;hocked; but concealing my &s;en|&s;ations, I addre&s;&s;ed Parkin&s;on with an appearance of perfect confidence. He &s;poke frankly, and with a countenance of plea|&s;ure. Stepping out with young Parker, he left me with M'Far|lane, to whom I had bowed, but not yet &s;poken. I was &s;it|ting ju&s;t by him, within a &s;tep, in the &s;mall room. I kept my eye upon his hand, and his rifle, and thought, if I &s;aw him move, to &s;eize his rifle; I could, perhaps, by a &s;udden &s;pring, gain the door. I ca&s;t a glance at a window in the room, and thought of &s;pringing, head foremo&s;t, through it, if I &s;aw him move. My fear was, that the young man would not have the re&s;olution to offend the country, by interfering to de|fend me, after what Parkin&s;on might communicate to him, out of doors. I thought my &s;ituation precarious, and the chances again&s;t me. While the&s;e were my &s;en&s;ations, I turned round, with an open and direct countenance, to M'Farlane; Mr. M'Farlane, &s;aid I, the&s;e are di&s;agreeable times, Indeed they are, Mr. Brackenridge, &s;aid he. The expre&s;&s;ion, and the man|ner, relieved me from my apprehen&s;ions in a moment; and left me only at a lo&s;s to account for his &s;eeming cordiality. For, continued he, I have been, for the&s;e two days, afraid of my life, becau&s;e I recommended &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. I have been afraid to &s;leep at home, and I am obliged now to go with my rifle. Ah hah, thought I, I &s;hall not be &s;hot yet.</P>
<P>Benjamin Parkin&s;on, in the mean time, came in, and expre&s;|&s;ed him&s;elf extremely happy at the information he had received
<PB N="17" REF="028332_0134_0FD89923850B2B10">
from young Parker; and much obliged to me, for my intention of coming over to &s;erve the &s;ettlement; that, for his part, he was heartily di&s;po&s;ed to &s;ubmit, and was going to the meeting for the purpo&s;e. I a&s;ked him, if he had a form of the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion? that, if not, I had a number of them in my pocket. He &s;aid, he had one. On enquiry, I found that the di&s;trict, where he had to attend, lay up the Monongahela, and out of my way to Pitt&s;burgh. Young Parker and Parkin&s;on urged me, with great &s;olicitation, to ride there, in order to a&s;&s;i&s;t in per&s;uading the people; but, judging from their apprehen&s;ions, I did not think it advi&s;eable to run the ri&s;k. I an&s;wered, that the Parker's family would doubtle&s;s credit their brother; and that he could give the &s;ame information that I could, and &s;tate my &s;olicitude, in riding all night, to &s;erve them; that if I went to any meet|ing at all, it would be to the Mingo meeting, which was on my way, and to that of Peter's creek di&s;trict, which was on my way al&s;o. The only que&s;tion now was, Whether it would be advi&s;eable to go to the Mingo meeting? M'Farlane, with can|dour, and good will towards me, gave his opinion, that it was not advi&s;eable; that the rage of the people, again&s;t our com|mittee at Pitt&s;burgh, and me e&s;pecially, was violent; that, for his part, he was under apprehen&s;ions of going him&s;elf to the Mingo di&s;trict, though among&s;t his neighbours; and meant to go to David Hamilton's, about four miles di&s;tant, in a lateral direction, in order to find out, whether it would be &s;afe to go to the meeting. On this, I declined going; but purpo&s;ed writ|ing, by him, to Hamilton, an open letter, which might be read at the meeting, or el&s;ewhere, as containing information from me. The letter was as follows:
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DAVID HAMILTON: Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I have rode all night, from the court at We&s;tmoreland, with a view to come to the meeting of the Mingo creek di&s;|trict, but, from what I hear, do not think it &s;afe; but I &s;tate my &s;entiments, by letter, which you may con&s;ider as written to you and to others. It is to inform them, that the greater part of Allegheny county will &s;ubmit, and all We&s;tmoreland will, and I pre&s;ume Fayette. You will then be left alone. Surely you would not wi&s;h to give the exci&s;e officer the &s;atisfaction of hav|ing you hanged. For this rea&s;on, all tho&s;e that have been in|volved in any violence, ought e&s;pecially to &s;ave them&s;elves. It is from motives of humanity that I have taken this trouble.

If there could have been any doubt of a force coming before, after the propo&s;itions of the commi&s;&s;ioners, if the people &s;hould per&s;i&s;t, there can be no doubt; and it will come with rage a|gain&s;t the country, after having rejected what is &s;o rea&s;onable.</P>
</LETTER></P>
<P>I took the road now towards Pitt&s;burgh, but not the direct road, as it would have led me by the Mingo creek meeting-hou&s;e. As I rode, I fell in with numbers, cro&s;&s;ing my cour&s;e, in a direction to the meeting, and all of them armed. Stopping at a cabin, to enquire the way, I was &s;truck with the appear|ance of John M'Donald, the &s;ecretary of the Mingo creek &s;o|ciety, &s;tepping out. I was not afraid of him, having had a con|ver&s;ation with him in Pitt&s;burgh, and knowing his &s;entiments to be moderate. His advice al&s;o to me was, not to go to the meeting: his expre&s;&s;ion was, "Let them go to the devil their own way."</P>
<P>Enquiring the way to Pitt&s;burgh, he directed me by the hou&s;e of John Holcroft. That is the very man, &s;aid I, that I am the mo&s;t afraid of; he is Tom the Tinker. I was obliged to put up with the in&s;ulting language of one of his &s;ons, the other day, in Pitt&s;burgh; not thinking it &s;afe to re&s;ent it, in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of things. He threatened the town with Tom the Tinker.</P>
<P>M'Donald gave me directions, in what manner, cro&s;&s;ing a certain road, that led from the hou&s;e of Holcroft, I could a|void it, by a circuit through the woods, and come into the road again. But before I had got to that point, I met two men on hor&s;eback, one of whom acco&s;ted me by name, and expre&s;|&s;ed him&s;elf &s;orry, that he had &s;et out before I had got to his hou&s;e, that he might have offered me a little whi&s;key, and &s;ome|thing for my hor&s;e to eat; but, &s;aid he, I will go back with you to the hou&s;e. I was not without apprehen&s;ions of every man; neverthele&s;s, I thought the &s;afe&s;t way was, to affect to have confidence, and I &s;uffered him to ride back with me. The man with him accompanied us.</P>
<P>When we came in &s;ight of the hou&s;e, I knew the farm to be that on which a certain Samuel Irwin, &s;ome years ago, had lived; and which I knew had been &s;old to Holcroft. Heavens! thought I, is this Tom the Tinker? is he to get his &s;ons to help to murder me, that he is taking me to his own hou&s;e? pretend|ing civility, but meaning to put it out my power to negociate with commi&s;&s;ioners any more. However, I concealed my ap|prehen&s;ions, and entered his hou&s;e. Our conver&s;ation turned
<PB N="19" REF="028332_0136_0FD8992526022DC8">
upon the bu&s;ine&s;s of the day; the &s;igning a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. Hol|croft gave me to under&s;tand, that the people were greatly a|ver&s;e in that neighbourhood, and threatened death. That is unrea&s;onable, &s;aid the man that was in company; it is not &s;o with us, in our &s;ettlement. We allow free liberty of con&s;cience, and mole&s;t no man for doing what he plea&s;es. Every man that chu&s;es to &s;ubmit, let him do it; and we give him five weeks, to &s;ell off his effects, and move out of the country. I was di|verted with his ideas of perfect freedom; but thought that, in five weeks, probably, the &s;ituation of the pro&s;cribed and the pro&s;cribing would be changed, without the days of grace, to &s;ell off effects and move away.</P>
<P>I could di&s;cover, in Holcroft, he&s;itation to know what to do. I explained my&s;elf fully; informed him of the hi&s;tory of cro&s;|&s;ing from We&s;tmoreland, with what views, &amp;c. He expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf happy in having &s;een me, and wi&s;hed me to go to the meeting with him, and to which he had been on his way; but acknowledged there would be danger of in&s;ult. I declined go|ing for this rea&s;on, and becau&s;e I was now on my way pa&s;t the ground. I took leave of Tom the Tinker, and came on.</P>
<P>On my way to Peter's creek, I under&s;tood that a company of rifle-men had gone forward, in order to oppo&s;e a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. Neverthele&s;s, I did not he&s;itate to go on, as it was in the neigh|bourhood of Pitt&s;burgh, viz. about 7 miles di&s;tant; and I felt my&s;elf more at home, and knew the people more generally, and had a greater confidence in my influence with them. On my arrival at the meeting, I was informed, that captain Miller, the member of the committee, of whom I have given &s;ome account, with his company, had oppo&s;ed the &s;igning the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, and threatened death; but that the &s;igning was then opened in the hou&s;e, and per&s;ons had begun to go in. I &s;aw Miller's com|pany by them&s;elves, under &s;ome trees, at at a di&s;tance. Crowds of the people came around me, and I gave them an account of my having come from We&s;tmoreland, the preceding evening, and of the di&s;po&s;ition of that county to &s;ubmit. Having delay|ed half an hour, and conceiving all things to be going on well, I &s;et out to Pitt&s;burgh. Coming to town, I was happy to learn, that the people had generally &s;igned the form of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. It was too late, and the hours of &s;igning expired; but it was not for this rea&s;on, but becau&s;e I had no &s;olicitude to bring my&s;elf within the amne&s;ty, not conceiving my&s;elf to have any need of it&punc; that I did not go forward, even then, to put my name to the paper. I went forward next day and put my name to it,

<P>BEFORE the day of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, great pains had been tak|en, not only by the civil officers, and men of political appoint|ment, and by the bar in different counties, and prudent men every where; but, in particular, by the clergy, in various congregations. The reverend Samuel Porter, and the rever|end John M'Millan, and others of the &s;ame denomination, had, from the fir&s;t, borne a decided te&s;timony again&s;t the forcible op|po&s;ition to the laws. Previous to the day of giving the te&s;t of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, M'Millan having appointed a day for giving the &s;a|crament of bread and wine, adjourned the celebration, until it could be known who would &s;ubmit; meaning to exclude tho&s;e from the ordinance, w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> &s;hould remain ob&s;tinate, and refu&s;e this declaration of fidelity. He attended him&s;elf, on the day of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, and u&s;ed his immediate influence, but not to much effect. The table was carried away, on which the pa|pers were put, to be &s;igned; and &s;uch was the di&s;turbance, that the meeting had finally to break up.</P>
<P>At Mingo creek, a body of men armed, paraded, and me|naced death to any one that would breathe a thought of &s;ub|mitting. A ju&s;tice of the peace had taken his &s;eat, and a few per&s;ons had got their names on his paper, when the armed mul|titude broke in, and prevented any more. They tore the pa|per in pieces; and it was not until after night, when every thing was thought to be over, that the &s;ame per&s;ons, and &s;ome others, getting together with the magi&s;trate again, &s;igned a|new; and the ju&s;tice, putting it in the pad of his &s;addle, got off with it, to the place of return, at Wa&s;hington.</P>
<P>At Wa&s;hington, Bradford had become a convert to &s;ubmi&s;|&s;ion; putting it on the principle of being de&s;erted and left to him&s;elf, and therefore it was in vain any longer to &s;tand out. At a large meeting of the people, in the court-hou&s;e, he made a &s;peech of two hours, and recommended &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. He him|&s;elf &s;igned on the day. James Mar&s;hall, John Canon, and a

con&s;iderable number of others, who had appeared in the &s;cene, al&s;o &s;igned. Some were ob&s;tinate, and would not.</P>
<P>In the upper part of Wa&s;hington county, the &s;igning was in|con&s;iderable. In the upper part of Allegheny county, and the lower part of We&s;tmoreland, in what are called the forks of the Monongahela and the Youghagheny rivers, major Scott, whom I &s;aw at Devore's ferry, attended with his rifle, and headed the violent, who prevented the &s;igning. At the di&s;trict where Benjamin Parkin&s;on went, there was an oppo&s;ition, but &s;ome &s;igned; the Parker family particularly; Parkin&s;on had not the re&s;olution. In the lower part of Allegheny county, the member of the committee, who had carried down the papers, was &s;urrounded, in his hou&s;e, by a ma&s;ked body of men, and had his papers taken from him. In &s;ome places, and &s;ome at all places, &s;igned for war in&s;tead of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>In Fayette county, the form pre&s;cribed by the commi&s;&s;ioners was not &s;igned at all; it was under an idea, that the la&s;t commit|tee of conference, from Brown&s;ville, had not authority to change the terms agreed upon with the fir&s;t. They were commi&s;&s;ioned only, to endeavour to procure an enlargement and amelioration. This was true; and they did not change. It was the commi&s;|&s;ioners that changed; con&s;idering them&s;elves as ab&s;olved from their engagement with the fir&s;t &s;tipulations, in con&s;equence of what amounted to a rejection, by the vote of the committee. And there was no que&s;tion, but by the negative of the minority they were ab&s;olved; for the condition of amne&s;ty, in the fir&s;t, was, "that the peace being kept, and the law obeyed, by the whole country, to the 10th day of July, then next following." Here was what amounted to a declaration of war, by twenty-three town&s;hips; and put an end to all contemplation of a gen|eral and &s;incere acquie&s;cence in the execution of the laws <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">If there &s;hall be a general and &s;incere acquie&s;cence, in the &s;aid laws, un|til the &s;aid 10th of July next, a general pardon and oblivion, of all &s;uch of|fences, &s;hall be granted.</NOTE>.</P>

of Fayette, held at Union Town, on the 10th of September, 1794. Twenty-one members pre&s;ent, at lea&s;t; they preferred the giving government a&s;&s;urances of their &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, agreeably to the terms &s;ettled with the fir&s;t conferees, and made a declar|ration to that effect <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The terms which had been obtained by the fir&s;t committee of confer|ence, having, however, been changed, in point of form, at the la&s;t confer|ence, in which we were repre&s;ented only by one member, altho' the com|mittee had not received power for that purpo&s;e, it is nece&s;&s;ary for us to take them into con&s;ideration. It is alledged by the commi&s;&s;ioners, on the part of the union, that the &s;tanding committee of the we&s;tern counties, having neglected at Red&s;tone, to make the declaration and recommendations requir|ed of them, in the explicit manner which was &s;ettled at the fir&s;t conference, the terms are broken on the part of the &s;aid committee, and the commi&s;&s;ioners now required that tho&s;e declarations, which it was the duty of the &s;tanding committee to make, &s;hould be made by the people them&s;elves, and te&s;tified by the individual &s;ignatures of the citizens, excepting at the &s;ame time, from the amne&s;ty, &s;uch of the concerned in the late offences, as &s;hall refu&s;e or neglect to &s;ign the &s;ame. To that, or to a &s;imiliar mode of giving a&s;&s;ur|ance of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, which was propo&s;ed at the fir&s;t conference, it was ob|jected, that &s;uch a mode, if adopted, might be mi&s;under&s;tood, and have a tendency to defeat the propo&s;ed object, in as much as per&s;ons not immedi|ately concerned in the riots, would not chu&s;e to &s;ign individually, for fear it might be con&s;trued as a tacit acknowledgement that they had actually brok|en the peace. And we may now add, that as a great inducement for the per&s;ons not concerned to give a&s;&s;urances of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion at all, was to procure an amne&s;ty for the offenders, this motive exi&s;ts no longer, &s;ince the pardon for every individual, concerned, depends upon his own &s;ignature. In as much, therefore, as the body of the people of this country can derive no benefit from an act of oblivion, for offences, in which they have not had any &s;hare; we are of opinion, that, however di&s;po&s;ed they hitherto have been, might have in the neighbouring counties, will induce us to u&s;e every means to render the a&s;&s;urances of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion more ea&s;y, and of cour&s;e more accep|table to the citizens. The be&s;t mode of doing it, is, for our&s;elves, who are the committee for Fayette county, to make tho&s;e declarations, which were required from the &s;tanding committee of Red&s;tone, and having thus &s;trictly adhered, on our pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t, as far as relates to this country, on the que&s;tion contained in the letter of the commi&s;&s;ioners, of the 22d of Augu&s;t, without requiring from them any individual &s;ignature.</P>
<P>For the&s;e rea&s;ons, and upon the&s;e principles, wi&s;hing however to have it fully under&s;tood, that from the following declaration, no implication is to be drawn of an acknowledgement that we have ever failed, either directly, or indirectly in that duty which every citizen owes to his country, viz. &s;ubmi&s;|&s;ion to its laws; we, the committee of town&s;hips, for the county of Fay|ette, do not he&s;itate explicitly to declare our determination to &s;ubmit to the laws of the United States, and of the &s;tate of Penn&s;ylvania, not to oppo&s;e di|rectly or indirectly the execution of the acts for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing a revenue on di&s;tilled &s;pirits, and &s;tills, and to &s;upport (as far as the law require<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">) the civil autho|rity, in affording the protection due to all officers and citizens; and we do further recommend to our fellow citizens, a perfect and entire acquie&s;cence under the execution of &s;aid acts, and al&s;o that no violence, injuries, or threats be offered to the per&s;on, or again&s;t the property of any officer of the United States, or of the &s;tate of Penn&s;ylvania, nor of citizens complying with the laws. At the &s;ame time we make tho&s;e explicit or &s;incere declara|tio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s and recommendations, we al&s;o candidly and openly declare out inten|tion to per&s;i&s;t in every <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> and con&s;titutional mea&s;ure, that may tend to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"></P></NOTE>. The fact is, the committee had no power to make new terms; but the commi&s;&s;ioners had power to offer, through the organ of the committee, new terms to the body of the people. The inhabitants of Fayette county, met in three di&s;tricts, out of four; 721 attending, out of whom 560 declar|ed their determination to &s;ubmit to the laws.</P>
<P>Numbers, that had been prevented &s;igning on the day, or who, on reflection, thought it advi&s;eable to &s;ign, came to the officer in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the paper, and &s;igned afterwards. I was con&s;ulted on the &s;ubject by many, who came from a con&s;idera|ble di&s;tance to have my opinion on the validity of &s;igning after the day. I had no he&s;itation in declaring a perfect confidence in the executive, that a liberal con&s;truction would be given to the terms of the commi&s;&s;ioners; and that where it &s;hould be

proved, to the &s;atisfaction of the executive, that the not &s;ub|mitting was owing to a force preventing them, and that they had &s;igned as &s;oon as they could have it in their power, after the removal of the force, it would be con&s;idered as equivalent to a &s;igning on the day. It could not be pleaded in a court of ju&s;|tice, as a pardon; but the executive would not be able to re|concile it with the &s;pirit of the terms, to proceed in the pro&s;e|cution; or, at lea&s;t, he would not chu&s;e to proceed again&s;t re|pentant offenders, under the&s;e circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>The return of the papers, from the &s;everal di&s;tricts, were to be made to James Ro&s;s, of the commi&s;&s;ion, on the 16th, at Union Town; who, from thence, was to &s;et out for Philadel|phia.</P>
<P>Having &s;et out, he was pur&s;ued a day's journey by two men, under pretence of taking the papers from him; but who, coming up, informed him, they wi&s;hed to get their names put down; and, as it afterwards appeared, the&s;e very men had been active, in their own di&s;tricts at home, to hinder others from &s;igning, and had not &s;igned them&s;elves.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV.</HEAD>
<P>IT began now to be mentioned in Pitt&s;burgh, that it might be &s;afe to recal the exiles. A town meeting was called, to con&s;ider of it. The idea was &s;ugge&s;ted, chiefly a by gentle|man related to Kirkpatrick, and who had not been pre&s;ent dur|ing the fury of the di&s;turbance, and had not a perfect know|ledge of the yet un&s;ettled di&s;po&s;ition of the people. He was, moreover, &s;upported in his propo&s;ition by a gentleman of the bar, who had al&s;o been ab&s;ent from the country, the greate&s;t part of the period, and came forward, at this juncture, to di&s;|tingui&s;h him&s;elf, in doing &s;omething. He was an adver&s;ary of mine; we had been upon bad terms for a long time. It is on account of his connections, that I do not introduce his name.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t of his appearance, after his return, was at Brown&s;|ville, the fir&s;t morning of our meeting. The moment I &s;aw him, I knew his object would be to do me mi&s;chief; but it would be &s;ome time, before he could reco<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">oitre the ground, and determine upon the ways and means of acting. I knew him to be intriguing, and to have exerci&s;ed the powers of his mind in this way, and in no other way, through his life; but I was at a lo&s;s to know what he could lay hold of. He would have &s;en&s;e enough to di&s;cover, that the in&s;urrection was broken, by the propo&s;itions of the commi&s;&s;ioners; and that it would not be &s;afe, now, to take any part with it; and therefore it would not do to oppo&s;e the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, or di&s;approve of it. He could not, therefore, join in the clamour, with open mouth: or &s;up|port Br<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">dford <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">
<PB N="25" REF="028332_0142_0FD89930F85CC1B8">
having al&s;o come on from that place, his fir&s;t addre&s;s was with the commi&s;&s;ioners; in&s;inuating, that I had been concerned in the in&s;urrection, and privy to the tran&s;actions of Bradford; that Bradford had given him this information at Brown&s;ville.</P>
<P>I had traver&s;ed in my imagination, all po&s;&s;ible ground which he would find to injure me, but I had never thought of an in|&s;inuation of that nature. I had thought of nothing, but his inflaming Bradford and the people again&s;t me, and had attribut|ed the di&s;&s;atisfaction, which Bradford had di&s;covered, to his management, in &s;ome degree. I had al&s;o ob&s;erved him in clo&s;e conver&s;ation with a younger brother of M'Farlane, that had fallen, and other violent men; and I apprehended a good deal from that increa&s;e he would give to their re&s;entment. It nev|er had entered my mind that he would venture upon a calumny of this kind. I had avered in my public &s;peech, my not only having nothing to do with any of the acts of violence, but my total di&s;approbation of them. I was not contradicted by Brad|ford; though he replied to me in warm invectives, yet he had not the audacity to in&s;inuate any thing to this effect.</P>
<P>I was unwilling that any unfavourable impre&s;&s;ion &s;hould be made upon the minds of the commi&s;&s;ioners, and I took the fir&s;t opportunity of giving them a key to all that could be &s;aid by my brother of the bar; by informing them that a difference exi&s;ted between us, and referring to James Ro&s;s, for a know|ledge of the fact. The commi&s;&s;ioners a&s;&s;ured me, that any thing he had &s;aid, had made no impre&s;&s;ion, and &s;hould make none; that even taking it for granted that Bradford had &s;aid &s;o, he had given &s;ufficient proof of his want of truth and honour, in violating his private promi&s;e, and public &s;tipulation, in &s;up|port of the propo&s;itions, to put the credibility of any a&s;&s;ertion of his, altogether out of view. This was the language of com|mi&s;&s;ioner Yates to me, in the pre&s;ence of James Ro&s;s.</P>
<P>My brother of the bar had, in the mean time, made all po&s;|&s;ible experiments upon the minds of the people of Pitt&s;burgh, to induce them to believe that I had been privy to the tran&s;actions of Bradford; that, at the Mingo creek meeting, I had pro|jected the intercepting the mail, in order to get the letters that were found, and have the writers bani&s;hed; that, hav|ing private malice again&s;t the&s;e per&s;ons, I had planned the mat|ter to injure them. But it was a&s;ked. How did I manage a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="26" REF="028332_0143_0FD899328A2A10E8">
trace the origin of the fact, as I have explained, in the cour&s;e of my narrative. It has been &s;een that it was contrived before the Mingo creek meeting, and before I &s;aw Bradford, to have any communication with him.</P>
<P>It was to have the credit of &s;eeming to have done &s;omething for the exiles, that my brother of the bar had &s;upported the recalling them at this time.</P>
<P>I had notice of the town-meeting, and attended. My brother of the bar opened the meeting, with an harangue of con&s;idera|ble length. The &s;cope of it was an invective again&s;t tho&s;e who led the people into the in&s;urrection, and had now de&s;erted them. This was the only &s;entiment he had to expre&s;s, but if he wanted variety of thought, he made it up by variety of action. But as there was no one, who de&s;erted the people, his invec|tive was without an object. He put me in mind of a man, whom I knew in early life, who had been taught the u&s;e of a &s;mall &s;word, and when he had taken a cup, as he was accu&s;|tomed to do, and was coming home, in a moon light night, and &s;eeing a bu&s;h with a &s;hadow, he would imagine it to be the devil with a tail, and would begin to fence with his &s;taff, "there I have you, Satan; there I have you, devil." So it was with my brother of the bar, here he was with violent ge&s;tures de|claiming again&s;t &s;ome devil, and no one, but him&s;elf, &s;aw any.</P>
<P>The idea, however, of de&s;erting the people, was a &s;tring to harp upon. I never knew the people them&s;elves complain of this. They knew that no one had de&s;erted them; but &s;ome of them were ob&s;tinate, in not coming off the ground, when a parley had been beaten, a negociation taken place, and the conditions of peace were announced, by the per&s;ons whom they had appointed to negociate. Men of &s;en&s;e accepted the &s;tipu|lations, and drew off, and told all to do &s;o. Some, like fools, would &s;tay and fight. Was this de&s;erting them?</P>
<P>After this harangue, to which there was no reply, the gen|tleman, related by affinity to Kirkpatrick, brought forward a a propo&s;ition for the recal of the exiles. I was alarmed, and thought it not prudent. The pre&s;ent interval of quietne&s;s in the country, might be an in&s;iduous calm. The fir&s;t movement that would take place, if any did place, would be on hearing of the advance of a force, on the part of the government. It would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">
<PB N="27" REF="028332_0144_0FD8857EEE143038">
certainly they would entertain no idea of returning in the pre|&s;ent &s;ituation of affairs.</P>
<P>However, it was urged, and I acquie&s;ced; but it was con|trary to my judgment, and not agreeable to the general &s;en&s;e of the town. There were &s;ome for it; and it was improper to divide upon it.

<P>THE return made to government, of the &s;ignatures for &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion, bore &s;o &s;mall a proportion to the number of the inhab|itants, that it had been con&s;idered, on the part of the govern|ment, as unavoidably nece&s;&s;ary to &s;end a force to reduce them.

Many &s;till affected to di&s;believe it, becau&s;e they had heretofore &s;aid, that a force would not come; and &s;ome did really di&s;believe it. Neverthele&s;s, the belief in it was gaining ground every day; and bringing to &s;ome &s;en&s;e of danger, tho&s;e who had hitherto &s;tood out.</P>
<P>Though I had he&s;itated to go the court of Wa&s;hington, which was to begin the 22d of September, yet now, under the&s;e cir|cum&s;tances, I thought it &s;afe to go.</P>
<P>At the court, I was informed of what I have &s;tated, viz. that
<PB N="29" REF="028332_0146_0FD899391FD60640">
Bradford, on the day of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, had recommended to the people to &s;ubmit. The popular language, with re&s;pect to him, was, that "DAGON was fallen."</P>
<P>I do not know that he had any idea, at this time, that he was not within the amne&s;ty. I pre&s;ume not: for he had been &s;olicitous to gain the concurrence of the people to &s;ign, in or|der that he might venture to do it him&s;elf. He was out of the amne&s;ty, no doubt *, by his &s;peech at Brown&s;ville, on the 28th; but the man had not preci&s;ion of thought &s;ufficient to di&s;cover it.</P>
<P>My brother of the bar was paying great court to him; their heads were con&s;tantly together, at the table, whi&s;pering; and out of doors, they were arm in arm, walking; or hats off, at a di&s;tance, to each other. I knew by brother of the bar had de&s;pi&s;ed Bradford, and Bradford had di&s;liked him; but the an|cient enmity of the one towards me, and the recent di&s;&s;atis|faction of the other, had cemented them in great apparent cor|diality. I was determined to wait quietly, to &s;ee what this hatching would produce. I did not know what Bradford might be brought to &s;ay; I knew my brother of the bar to have will, and not to want ingenuity. From the incidents I have traced, in the cour&s;e of this narrative, it will be &s;een, that Bradford was not incapable of a deflection from the truth. I did not know how far the pre&s;ervation of him&s;elf, in the hope of ob|taining the clemency of the government, might lead him to gra|tify tho&s;e who might have the ear of it. But I tru&s;ted to this, that it is &s;o difficult to make fal&s;hood con&s;i&s;tent, that he would not be able to put it together, in &s;uch a manner as to render it pro|bable.</P>
<P>The Democratic Society, of Wa&s;hington, was convened, du|ring the court. It had been propo&s;ed to publi&s;h re&s;olutions, expre&s;&s;ing the &s;entiments of the &s;ociety, with regard to the late violations of the laws, after the example of the Democratic Society at New-York, and Philadelphia. A committee was ap|pointed, to draw up the re&s;olutions.</P>
<P>A young gentleman of the bar, Dor&s;ey Penteco&s;t, was one: and having drawn a &s;ketch, he &s;hewed it to me, and wi&s;hed me, as having more politically con&s;idered the&s;e matters, to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in forming it, to be laid before the committee. I a&s;&s;i&s;ted him: and expre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf, with regard to the outrages, in very

read in the &s;ociety. Bradford, who was a member, heard them with embarra&s;&s;ment, and moved for a po&s;tponement, for a con|&s;ideration of them, at that time. He &s;aid, a fuller meeting was expected the week following. The con&s;ideration was po&s;tponed, and I never heard any more of them.</P>
<P>At the opening of this court, judge Addi&s;on delivered his charge to the grand jury, and received from them an explicit approbation of the &s;entiments contained in it. The people &s;eem|ed to have become &s;en&s;ible of their error, or at lea&s;t of their danger. I believe that great numbers had become better in|formed; but I mu&s;t admit, that the conver&s;ion, with the bulk, was the re&s;ult of fear.</P>
<P>Judge Addi&s;on had held a court, in the mean time, in Fay|ette, and brought a favourable account of the impre&s;&s;ions of the people of that county. On the 17th of the month, a commit|tee of town&s;hips had met at Union Town, at which re&s;olutions had been taken into view, and adopted, expre&s;&s;ive of a good di&s;po&s;ition to pre&s;erve order, and &s;upport the laws <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">; and hold|ing out an idea, that, &s;o far as it re&s;pected that county, it would not be nece&s;&s;ary to have recour&s;e to the aid of military force.</P>
<P>During the &s;e&s;&s;ion of the court, the like favourable account had been received from almo&s;t all quarters. With the &s;uitors of the court, and all per&s;ons attending, there appeared the mo&s;t perfect good di&s;po&s;ition to &s;ubmit to the laws. In the countenances of the unfortunate per&s;ons, who had been involv|ed,

and had not taken the benefit of the amne&s;ty, you could &s;ee terror and di&s;may. They &s;aw before them, the nece&s;&s;ity of re|linqui&s;hing the country in&s;tantly, or being hanged. I &s;aw Benjamin Parkin&s;on, but he hung down his head as I pa&s;&s;ed. He was con&s;cious to him&s;elf, that he had acted like a coward, and that I knew it. A man in a pillory, could not have been more a&s;hamed to lift up his face. He was one of fifty-two, who met &s;ome days previous to the &s;igning, and &s;olemnly pledged them|&s;elves to come forward, at a larger meeting, and &s;upport the idea of &s;ubmitting.</P>
<P>At a larger meeting, of 200, which took place the day after, finding the current &s;et in a contrary direction, he lifted both hands, and declared that he never had con&s;ented to &s;ign. I have related his earne&s;tne&s;s to be put upon the li&s;t of tho&s;e entitled to the amne&s;ty, at the time I &s;aw him at his hou&s;e; he had not courage to &s;ign, that day, at his di&s;trict. His lan|guage was, "I advi&s;e you to &s;ign, but I will not." The fol|lowing day, he employed a per&s;on to put his name to the pa|per, and afterwards denied that he had employed him.</P>
<P>Towards the end of the week, the court having ri&s;en, I was reque&s;ted to attend a meeting in the court-hou&s;e. I attended. A number of gentlemen of the county had convened; pre&s;i|dent Addi&s;on, the a&s;&s;i&s;tant judges, and others. The &s;tate of the country was taken into con&s;ideration, and it was propo&s;ed to pa&s;s re&s;olutions &s;imiliar to tho&s;e of Fayette.</P>
<P>Though not of the county, yet having been a&s;ked to the meeting, I took the liberty of ob&s;erving, that, if it was the ob|ject to give the government &s;uch a&s;&s;urances of the re&s;toration of order, as would ju&s;tify the di&s;mi&s;&s;ion of the force which had been ordered, the proper means would be, to call the original Parkin&s;on's ferry delegates to meet at the &s;ame place, and from thence &s;end forward <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> declaration of their &s;entiments, and dele|gates to the Pre&s;ident, to explain all circum&s;tances. It was agreed; and I was reque&s;ted to in&s;ert in the Pitt&s;burgh Gazette an adverti&s;ement to that effect.</P>
<P>I knew it would not be a wi&s;h with the government, to be under the nece&s;&s;ity of coming forward, and I thought it for the honour of the country, that a nece&s;&s;ity &s;hould not exi&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="028332_0149_0FD8993F53F3F4B8">A con&s;iderable number of delegates met at Parkin&s;on's ferry, on the 2d of October. General Wilkins, and others from Al|legheny county, attended with me. Re&s;olutions were pa&s;&s;ed, expre&s;&s;ive of our ideas of the then &s;tate of the country. Wil|liam Findley and David Reddick, prothonotary of Wa&s;hington, were appointed delegates to the Pre&s;ident.</P>
<P>General Wilkins and my&s;elf had objected to the po&s;itivene&s;s of the expre&s;&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ns, with regard to the re&s;toration of order. It was ob&s;erved by me, "that, as on the one hand, it would be painful to &s;ee an army in this country, which, in &s;pite of all po&s;|&s;ible di&s;cipline, would commit outrages on per&s;ons and property, yet, on the other hand, I would not wi&s;h to deceive the gov|ernment." General Wilkins made the like ob&s;ervations.</P>
<P>Judge Addi&s;on, who was &s;ecretary, ob&s;erved, that as dele|gates were appointed to explain circum&s;tances to the Pre&s;ident, it could be left to his di&s;cretion to judge, and relieve us from that per&s;onal re&s;pon&s;ibility, which would otherwi&s;e exi&s;t.

<P>Bradford and Mar&s;hall had attended at Parkin&s;on's. Great was the difference in the temper of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing, from that which prevailed at the fir&s;t, on the &s;ame ground. I felt great pity for &s;ome that appeared di&s;tre&s;&s;ed at their ow<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> ob&s;tinacy, which had brought us to this trouble. Bradford appeared thoughtful, but behaved with his u&s;ual folly. He nominated John Cannon to the chair; who took it. It &s;truck judge Addi|&s;on and others of us, as improper; col. Cannon having been chairman of a former obnoxious committee, at Pitt&s;burgh&punc; and al&s;o deeply involved in the late outrages; and it would be no good &s;ymptom to the Pre&s;ident that we had made him chairman on this occa&s;ion. This was hinted to col. Cannon him&s;elf, and pre&s;&s;ed with all po&s;&s;ible delicacy; but Bradford in&s;i&s;ted on his keeping the chair, and Cannon him&s;elf was tenacious of it. However, in making out our report, we kept his name out of view, and made no mention of a chairman at all.</P>
<P>I had no conver&s;ation with Bradford, during the court at Wa&s;hington, or at this meeting, but in public. I knew the predicament in which he &s;tood, and avoided him. I thought it of little con&s;equence to him, whether the army came to the country, or not, for he would have to leave it, or be arre&s;ted for trial at Philadelphia. It occurred to me, at the time, that the &s;tronge&s;t proof the Pre&s;ident could have of the re&s;toration of the authority of the law, and a proper one, would be for judge Addi&s;on to arre&s;t him, and &s;end him down. It did not &s;uit me to &s;ugge&s;t this. At the &s;ame time that I wi&s;hed to &s;erve the country, I did not like to hurt my&s;elf; it would have been an unpopular act; and on principles of humanity, I could not reconcile it to my feelings, to be the means of arre&s;ting any one; nothing but an ab&s;olute official duty could induce me. At the &s;ame time, it is to be ob&s;erved in his ca&s;e, and that of others, that it would be improper to have undertaken to &s;ay who were not within the amne&s;ty, or had forfeited it; of this the executive would judge, in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, and it would
<PB N="34" REF="028332_0151_0FD89944D8A737E0">
be proper to wait until orders of arre&s;t come from the judicial authority of the union.</P>
<P>I had not &s;aid a word to Bradford, in the mean time, with regard to the information he was &s;aid to have given to my bro|ther of the bar; it was for this rea&s;on: My name was &s;till in view as a candidate for the Congre&s;s; and Bradford had influ|ence, and I did not wi&s;h to break with him, but as little as po&s;|&s;ible, until that was over. My brother of the bar had &s;aid that judge Addi&s;on was pre&s;ent, when Bradford had given the information; or that Bradford had given the like information to judge Addi&s;on. I a&s;ked judge Addi&s;on, and he &s;aid it was not the ca&s;e. He had heard Bradford &s;ay nothing more, than to complain of me, that I had not &s;poken more plainly to him, at an earlier period. I made enquiry of Mr. Reddick, with whom Bradford was intimate, whether he had ever &s;ugge&s;ted any thing of the kind, that I had been privy to his tran&s;actions. Mr Reddick &s;aid not, but the contrary. He complained that I had not given him my confidence, at an early period. The truth is, I gave it as much as I thought &s;afe. The fir&s;t time I &s;aw him, was at Mingo creek; he might have &s;een in my &s;peech, what my real &s;entiments were. Others &s;aw clearly. John Baldwin, one of tho&s;e involved in the burning of Neville's hou&s;e, has acknowledged to me, that it was that &s;peech that fir&s;t opened his eyes; and he had always thought Bradford a man of &s;en&s;e till that time. It would not have been &s;afe for me to &s;peak plainly on Braddock's field, or at Parkin&s;on's ferry. I did &s;peak, as &s;oon as it was prudent to do it; that is, in the committee of conference at Pitt&s;burgh. High enough indeed! Give my confidence to a man who had gone on to the commi&s;|&s;ion of high crimes, and had a mob at his command? But did I not &s;peak plainly at Brown&s;ville? &s;urely he had my confidence there, for all the meeting had it; and yet he an&s;wered me with all the pomp that his id<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a of &s;uperiority over me, in the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of the public confidence could in&s;pire, and if he in&s;ulted me after our negociation with the commi&s;&s;ioners, what would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e not have done at an earlier period, when he had tho&s;e at his back, who having no amne&s;ty to which they could look forward, would be di&s;po&s;ed to take the mo&s;t de&s;perate re&s;olutions, with regard to all who differed from them.</P>
<P>In the appointment of delegates, at the meeting at Parkin|&s;on's, to wait upon the Pre&s;ident, a circum&s;tance took place, which gave me the impre&s;&s;ion that Mar&s;hall as well as Brad|ford, was not favourably di&s;po&s;ed towards me.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="028332_0152_0FD89948342E8D10">John Lucas, a member of the committee, mentioned to me a conver&s;ation with Mar&s;hall, before the opening of the meeting "Whom do you think," &s;aid he, "&s;hall we &s;end as delegates to the Pre&s;ident? I have been thinking of Findley, Gallatin, and Brackenridge, but Bradford has conceived a prejudice again&s;t our friend Brackenridge."</P>
<P>When the point of chu&s;ing delegates came forward in the meeting, it was urged by judge Addi&s;on and gen. Wilkins, and others, that four per&s;ons, one from each county, &s;hould be ap|pointed, and I knew it was their wi&s;h that I &s;hould be one. Bradford &s;trenuou&s;ly oppo&s;ed it, though he could a&s;&s;ign no plau|&s;ible rea&s;ons. I &s;aw in&s;tantly it was to prevent the appoint|ment of me. Mar&s;hall &s;upported him; I had &s;uppo&s;ed to grat|ify him. I &s;upported him &s;trenuou&s;ly, though Addi&s;on and Wilkins were di&s;&s;atisfied. I had preci&s;ely the &s;ame object in view with him; to keep my&s;elf out. The election was coming on, and I cho&s;e to be at home.</P>
<P>It was carried that no regard &s;hould be paid to counties. It was then moved by Bradford, that two delegates &s;hould be ap|pointed from the we&s;tern country, and that the&s;e two &s;hould be Findley and Reddick. Mar&s;hall &s;upported the appointment of two, but propo&s;ed Findley and Gallatin. I &s;aw at this moment, that Mar&s;hall al&s;o was di&s;&s;atisfied with "friend Brackenridge", and that though he differed with Bradford, as to per&s;ons, yet they both wi&s;hed to exclude me. In this object I concurred with them, but meaning that Bradford &s;hould be gratified in all things, I &s;upported his nomination of Reddick, and we carried it.</P>
<P>I have never under&s;tood what was the ground of Mar&s;hall's di&s;&s;atisfaction, if he had any. Bradford had &s;aid, that I repre|&s;ented him in an unfavourable point of view to the commi&s;|&s;ioners at Pitt&s;burgh, during our conference. That was not the fact; I made the be&s;t apology for the conduct of both; &s;o that on one occa&s;ion the Attorney General ob&s;erved to James Ro&s;s, Is it po&s;&s;ible that Bradford and Mar&s;hall can be innocent too? I had &s;tated no more than what I have done in this narra|tive, that it was the people who had carried off both Mar&s;hall and Bradford, and not they the people.

<HEAD>CHAP. VI.</HEAD>
<P>THE general election, which was to take place on the 14th of October, was now approaching. My brother of the bar had offered him&s;elf as a candidate before my name was brought forward, and had availed him&s;elf of the temporary cir|cum&s;tances in canva&s;&s;ing again&s;t me. With tho&s;e oppo&s;ed to the outrages that had taken place, he in&s;inuated, that I had been at the bottom of them; and with the in&s;urgents them&s;elves, he a&s;&s;erted that I had been a &s;py for the government, from the fir&s;t; that I had taken notes, and would be the wor&s;t witne&s;s that would come forward again&s;t them. He retailed &s;craps of &s;peeches, which I was &s;aid to have made; viz. that the people of the country were a &s;et of "vipers and fools," and de&s;erved to be hanged for what they had done. At lea&s;t I have been led to under&s;tand that this was the nature of his addre&s;s. It was all fair; we were adver&s;aries.</P>
<P>Before the court at Wa&s;hington, I had received a note from Daniel Hamilton, who had commanded the advanced guard, on the day of Braddock's fields, and as we rode along had compli|mented me, at the time, by &s;aying, that my behaviour on the occa&s;ion would carry me to Congre&s;s. He now wi&s;hed to know whether I continued my name as a candidate for the Congre&s;s, as the prejudice was &s;trong again&s;t me, &s;ince the meeting at Brown&s;ville, and he was quite tired &s;upporting me again&s;t B. Parkin&s;on, and others. I wrote him a note in an&s;wer, that I was thinking nothing about it; there were objects of greater moment on my mind. The fact was, I was at that time, mak|ing arrangements to leave the country, if a war &s;hould en&s;ue. Hamilton had written with a view to induce me, to relinqui&s;h the idea of Congre&s;s, for<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">at that time, he had declared him&s;elf a candidate. In receiving my note, he con&s;trued it into a decli|nation on my part, and rode through the country reading it, with that con&s;truction. At the &s;ame time, he read a letter he pretended to have received from Tom the Tinker, advi&s;ing him, to declare him&s;elf. So that, I had my brother of the bar on the one hand, and Daniel Hamilton on the other, to contend with. Of the two, my brother of the bar was certainly the be&s;t
<PB N="37" REF="028332_0154_0FD8994C271E6398">
qualified, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing &s;ome legal knowledge; and in that particu|lar having the advantage of Hamilton. But, as it was natural, I was willing the people &s;hould think me better qualified than either. And I had turned my attention to the object, &s;ince the pro&s;pect of a re&s;toration of order had taken place.</P>
<P>Thomas Scott of Wa&s;hington, formerly of the Congre&s;s, was al&s;o a candidate, but with him and my&s;elf there was a good under&s;tanding, viz. that I gave him a preference to Hamilton, or to my brother of the bar. It was with he&s;itation that I had, at fir&s;t, thought of being a candidate. It was inconvenient, on the one hand, to go; but on the other hand, it was plea&s;ant to be among&s;t political and literary men for a while. At pre&s;ent, it was merely on a principle of pride, as my name had been u&s;|ed, that I would not withdraw it.</P>
<P>A few days before the election, hearing that it was general|ly credited in Wa&s;hington, that I had declined the election, I put a paragraph in the gazette contradicting the report <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><LETTER>
<HEAD>Citizens of the di&s;trict of Wa&s;hington and Allegheny,</HEAD>
<P>Previous to the late convul&s;ions, it was propo&s;ed to me to give my name, as a candidate for the Congre&s;s of the United States; I accepted the compli|ment. It is now circulated that I have declined it; No. Con&s;idering the delicacy of the times, I might wi&s;h I had not thought of it, but as it is, it would imply a fear of &s;ubmitting my conduct to inve&s;tigation, to withdraw my name from the public; I have therefore not done it. I may, at pre&s;ent, have le&s;s popularity than I had, but the time will come, when I &s;hall be con|&s;idered as having de&s;erved well of the country, in all the delicate conjun|tures, in which we have been &s;ituated.</P>

<PB N="43" REF="028332_0160_0FD885804BCEB098">
Why not move it my&s;elf? it is well known that the place of &s;econding is more favourable to a warm &s;upport of a mea&s;ure, than that of moving it in the fir&s;t in&s;tance. Be&s;ides, it was ne|ce&s;&s;ary for me to pre&s;erve my&s;elf, at that time, from all po&s;&s;i|ble odium, in order to accompli&s;h objects with the people, of a more &s;erious nature, and it would be le&s;s odious to &s;econd, than to move the re&s;olution. There was no per&s;on more inju|red in the expul&s;ion of the prothonotary than I was, or more intere&s;ted in his return; and it is fal&s;e in Bradford to &s;ay that I wi&s;hed him to oppo&s;e it. I &s;tated difficulties in order to inter|e&s;t him with me to overcome them. It was flattering his vani|ty to do this, and the way to per&s;uade him.</P>
<P>My brother of the bar, who had, at lea&s;t, the &s;uperinten|dence of this compo&s;ition of Bradford, was over&s;een in letting him put in this paragraph, for it &s;hakes the credit of all the re&s;t. I might be &s;uppo&s;ed willing to have the Neville's junto mortified, in getting the people at lea&s;t to talk of bani&s;hing them; but it is ab&s;urd to &s;uppo&s;e that a practi&s;ing lawyer would wi&s;h to derange his own bu&s;ine&s;s, by di&s;turbing the pro|thonotary.</P>
<P>The paragraph re&s;pecting Bri&s;on, has al&s;o this bad effect. It is travelling out of the interogatory of Craig, introducing what relates to an indifferent per&s;on. It is a negative, pregnant with regard to the allegation that I have been privy to the tran&s;|actions of Bradford, in general; that I had advi&s;ed or prompt|ed the&s;e; for on the &s;ame ground, at this time, he would have brought every in&s;tance out. I acknowledge that it operates al|&s;o, to give credit with regard to what he has &s;tated; for if he cho&s;e to invent at all, why not invent more.

<P>THE general election for a member of Congre&s;s, for the di&s;trict of Wa&s;hington and Allegheny, was held on the 14th of October; it might naturally be &s;uppo&s;ed that, notwith&s;tanding the hurricane of the in&s;urrection had &s;ub&s;ided, it mu&s;t have been in a great mea&s;ure, from the impul&s;e of fear, and that the &s;ame principle which produced it, mu&s;t &s;till have exi&s;tence in the minds of the people, and that for this rea&s;on the &s;pirit of in&s;ur|gency mu&s;t govern the election. If &s;o, the mo&s;t violent in&s;ur|gent, or one the mo&s;t favouring them would be cho&s;en. So it was, neverthele&s;s, that Daniel Hamilton, who had a command at the burning of Neville's hou&s;e, and at the election, &s;upport|ed by Bradford, was the lowe&s;t on the poll; and Albert Galla|tin, who had oppo&s;ed the idea of war, more directly, at the meeting at Parkin&s;on's than I had thought prudent, and who had di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf, afterwards at Brown&s;ville, in over|throwing the purpo&s;es of the violent, and was under the di&s;ad|vantage of being taking up, on three days notice, and out of his own di&s;trict&punc; was the highe&s;t. My brother of the bar, who had been ab&s;ent from the country, and was not under the nece&s;|&s;ity of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">fending the wi&s;hes of any one, and had courted the in|&s;urgents &s;ince his return, and was &s;upported by the Neville's intere&s;t, at the &s;ame time, was but little above Hamilton. My conduct during the early part of the in&s;urrection was of &s;uch a nature, that except with confidential per&s;ons, it was not under|&s;tood, and mu&s;t have been thought to have been equivocal. Yet I was on the poll, next to Gallatin. Thomas Scott, who had every <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">y expected a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination from the violent, at his own hou&s;e d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ring the di&s;turbance, was next to me. I cannot well explain all this. I &s;tate the facts. I &s;hould mo&s;t probably have been elected, had it not been under&s;tood in all the more remote part of Wa&s;hington county, that I had declined <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><LETTER>

<P>Mr. Gallatin's name was introduced all of a &s;udden, and without his knowledge, it was almo&s;t univ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ally under&s;tood in this county, that Mr. Brackenridge had declined.</P>

had but a few votes in that county, but the greater part of Allegheny, where I re&s;ide. I only remark further, that in Hamilton's di&s;trict, which is in the neighbourhood of Parkin|&s;on's ferry and Mingo creek, and was the hot bed of the in|&s;urrection, I had but 24 votes, Daniel Hamilton, 132, and my brother of the bar, 90; which was about a fourth of the whole he had in the two counties. I &s;tate this only to &s;hew who it was, that &s;tood faire&s;t with the mo&s;t violent of the in&s;urgents.</P>
<P>I had been perfectly quie&s;cent with regard to the election. I had heard the tales propagated among&s;t the in&s;urgents again&s;t me, and I had &s;een the hor&s;es from the public &s;tables di&s;patched by quarter ma&s;ter Craig, to all parts of the country, with tick|ets for my brother of the bar. The French convention had not more couriers out, at that time. But I was not di&s;turbed at this; for though I did not chu&s;e to withdraw my name, yet I did not wi&s;h to be elected. I knew that the &s;uffrages of the people, under exi&s;ting circum&s;tances, would be con&s;trued as a pre&s;ump|tion of having been more with them, in the recent convul&s;ion, than became a good citizen. It would render my character que&s;tionable abroad; I had rea&s;on in a very &s;hort time to look upon it as fortunate that I had not this pre&s;umption. This will open a new &s;cene upon the reader, as it did upon me.</P>
<P>I had heard before this, by individuals from Philadelphia, of the impre&s;&s;ion made upon the citizens, by my letter to Tench Coxe. That it was con&s;idered as a letter of defiance, and had excited an irre&s;i&s;table flame of indignation again&s;t me. This did not much di&s;turb me, at fir&s;t, for I conceived the govern|ment would under&s;tand it, and take it in good part, and the people in due time would under&s;tand it al&s;o. Mar&s;hal Lenox had gone to Philadelphia, and knew my &s;olicitude in his be|half, when at Pitt&s;burgh. Pre&s;ly Neville had gone, who, though &s;omewhat chagrined, becau&s;e I would not do every thing his way, yet, when his mind cooled, would &s;ee things in a more proper point of view, and would at all events, do me the ju&s;tice to acknowledge, that it was at his in&s;tance that I came forward at an early period of the bu&s;ine&s;s. Commi&s;&s;ioner Ro&s;s, who knew my conduct from the commencement, had been with the executive, and in &s;peaking of tho&s;e in this country, that were ho&s;tile or offenders, would repre&s;ent me favourably; on the&s;e grounds, I was perfectly ea&s;y, as to men of information near the Pre&s;ident, and concluded that from thence, ju&s;t ideas, with regard to me, would &s;pread, and gradually correct the popular error, with the militia that were coming forward. I had &s;een
<PB N="46" REF="028332_0163_0FD8995E2E910540">
paragraphs unfavourable, with regard to me, in the gazettes; but I thought nothing of that, con&s;idering them as the re&s;ult of an unavoidable, but temporary mi&s;conception. I had al&s;o heard of the flame excited by the "Indian treaty" publica|tion, which was charged to my account; and had rai&s;ed the re|&s;entment of the Jer&s;ey militia, in particular, &s;o that they were hewing me in imagination, with their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">abres, as they came a|long, and bayoneting every bu&s;h or other thing upon the road, and calling what they bayoneted, "Brackenridge". But I conceived it to be the policy of the more intelligent to let the people exerci&s;e their minds with &s;ome objects, and perhaps im|prove their re&s;entment, general, or particular, but not that any per&s;on, who knew my &s;tile, would take that publication for mine.</P>
<P>I had more rea&s;on to be apprehen&s;ive, than I was aware. A few days after the election, David Reddick, commi&s;&s;ioner with Findley, from the committee at Parkin&s;on's, returned from his mi&s;&s;ion to the Pre&s;ident, whom he had found at Carli&s;le, with the army on their march; he called upon me, and with great appearance of &s;olicitude, gave me to under&s;tand the unfavoura|ble point of view, in which I &s;tood with the army, and the great per&s;onal danger I had to apprehend from the threats a|gain&s;t me. That having occa&s;ionally introduced my name to the Pre&s;ident, as not being concerned in the in&s;urrection, he was &s;ilent. But that tho&s;e about him, appeared to have &s;trong prejudices. This brought to my mind, an expre&s;&s;ion I had &s;een in the addre&s;s of the Pre&s;ident at Carli&s;le; exhorting, among&s;t other things, "to detect intriguers". Thought I, that &s;a|vours a little of chevalier Neville. He knows that I cannot be charged with any overt act, and may have in&s;inuated there, as he had done here, that I have intrigued again&s;t the government. The fact was, the intriguers here were all on the &s;ide of gov|ernment; there was nothing but open force again&s;t it.</P>
<P>At the time Mr. Reddick called, I had ju&s;t fini&s;hed a repre|&s;entation, which I had taken into my head to draw up to the Pre&s;ident, and intended to communicate by the po&s;t; repre&s;ent|ing to him, "that whatever doubt might have been entertain|ed of the pacification of the country, at the time commi&s;&s;ioners Reddick and Findley left it; yet none could be entertained now, that I would pledge my life for it, that a &s;ingle troop of hor&s;e might come up and arre&s;t any man with &s;afety: that the depre&s;|&s;ion had been as &s;udden and as low, through the country, as the in&s;urgency was rapid, and the fury high before. That the
<PB N="47" REF="028332_0164_0FD8995F77D98BE0">
effect would be greater in re&s;ting the army at Bedford and Cum|berland, than in coming further; for report had magnified the force, and imagination is &s;tronger than the eye; and it would be a more dignified &s;pectacle to &s;ee the laws re&s;tored by the bare &s;hewing of an army, and the civil authority of this country, it&s;elf, in motion, to aid the authority of the union, in arre&s;ting offenders, than the whole body coming actually into the country; that five hundred hor&s;e might come on with the judge and the mar&s;hal, merely as an e&s;cort; not for &s;afety, but for dignity. That &s;omething was to be left to the honour of the country; and the line of demarcation perci&s;ely marked be|tween the impre&s;&s;ion of nece&s;&s;ary awe, and that of degrad|ing reduction: that the country could not always be retained by force, and therefore it would not be prudent to extingui&s;h affec|tion: that the people, then under his command, were &s;ubject to the like error with the people here; and it might, in the turn of things, at no very di&s;tant day, happen, that the government would &s;tand in need of the country to repre&s;s in&s;urrections el&s;e|where; that if the army &s;hould come into the country, they would come weary and fatigued, through the mountains, in the rains of the &s;ea&s;on, and would be &s;een to a di&s;advantage; they would be le&s;s &s;atisfied with the campaign them&s;elves, and the awful apprehen&s;ion, which the people here had, would be le&s;|&s;ened, and they would begin to &s;ay they could have fought them. It would be al&s;o difficult, if not impo&s;&s;ible, to re&s;train the army from depredations on property, or from per&s;onal in&s;ult; and that would &s;oar the minds of the be&s;t friends of the govern|ment; and reduce that internal check derived from their &s;up|port again&s;t another in&s;urrection."</P>
<P>I mentioned to Mr. Reddick what I had been about, but &s;aid, if this is the ca&s;e, that I am &s;u&s;pected, let me &s;ay what I may, it will be mi&s;con&s;trued; I &s;hall throw by my papers, and let things take their cour&s;e.</P>
<P>I was &s;truck with information from Mr. Reddick, of an ex|pre&s;&s;ion by the Pre&s;ident, when the commi&s;&s;ioners were &s;tating to him the probable irregularities of the army, from the tem|per in which they were, and po&s;&s;ible indi&s;criminate injury to per|&s;ons, as well as property. The Pre&s;ident &s;aid "that if a &s;in|gle gun was fired in oppo&s;ition, he could not an&s;wer for the con&s;equence." Thought I, if that is the ca&s;e, and the army &s;hould march into the country, whether a gun be fired or not, he, or tho&s;e who may command them, may not be able to an|&s;wer for the con&s;equence to individuals, who&s;e names are ob|noxious,
<PB N="48" REF="028332_0165_0FD89961B3650350">
it will not be &s;afe for me, as things now &s;tand, to tru&s;t my&s;elf in their way, but to avoid them, if practicable, un|til it can be &s;een, whether di&s;cipline and &s;ubordination to civil authority is pre&s;ervable, or not.</P>
<P>Commi&s;&s;ioner Reddick had propo&s;ed to call a third meeting of the Parkin&s;on's ferry delegates, and at the &s;ame time invite the mo&s;t con&s;picuous inhabitants to attend, in order to &s;end forward &s;uch further a&s;&s;urances to the Pre&s;ident, as might ju&s;ti|fy him in &s;u&s;pending the march of the troops, or at lea&s;t of the whole body. He put an adverti&s;ement in the paper to this ef|fect<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The commi&s;&s;ioners appointed by the Parkin&s;on's ferry committee to wait on the Pre&s;ident of the United States, and governor of Penn&s;ylvania, on the affairs of the we&s;tern counties of Penn&s;ylvania, having performed the duty, reque&s;ts the meeting of that committee on Friday, the 24 in&s;tant, at their u&s;ual place (Parkin&s;on's, ferry), in order to receive the commi&s;&s;ioners report.

<P>THE rage of the army again&s;t me appeared to increa&s;e, as they approached the country; at lea&s;t the accounts I received of menaces and death, were every day more frequent and de|termined. It was &s;aid, that I had &s;aved my&s;elf by the amne&s;ty of the government, but that &s;hould not &s;ave me from death without the forms of law. The executive would not be ju&s;ti|fiable in bringing me to trial, in violation of their faith; but, on moral or political grounds, there would be no impropriety in the army exerci&s;ing, at lea&s;t in one in&s;tance, an act of &s;um|mary, though irregular, ju&s;tice. This I under&s;tood to be the language, not of tho&s;e in the ranks of the common &s;oldiery on|ly, but of the highe&s;t officers.</P>
<P>The publication of Bradford had appeared, and that would complete the proof to the exiles, of what they would have only &s;u&s;pected before, viz. that I had prompted Bradford to their expul&s;ion. The&s;e were with the army, and would no doubt contribute to the flame that had prevailed. I had under&s;tood before this, by intelligence from Philadelphia, that Neville the younger, though not publicly charging me with being concern|ed in the in&s;urrection, yet his in&s;inuations, to individuals, were to that effect. Commi&s;&s;ioner Reddick, on his return from his fir&s;t mi&s;&s;ion, informed me, that, being in company with general Neville, he had &s;aid, that as I had a knowledge that his hou&s;e was to be burned, &s;ometime before it happened, he thought I might have given him &s;ome information, that he might have removed at lea&s;t his papers. I began to reflect what po&s;&s;ible ground he could have for &s;uppo&s;ing that I had a knowledge of an intention of burning his hou&s;e, before it took place. I re|collected that, after the burning of the hou&s;e, I mentioned the language of M'Donald, &s;ecretary of the Mingo meeting, to me, &s;ometime before, in my office; viz. that the people talked of breaking up Neville, and burning Pitt&s;burgh; and that I had thought nothing of it, at the time; but as they had burned Neville's hou&s;e, they might accompli&s;h the other part of the threat, and burn Pitt&s;burgh <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the te&s;timony of M'Donald in the Appendix.</NOTE>. This had been carried to gen|eral
<PB N="51" REF="028332_0168_0FD8996735E8DF70">
Neville, and he had deduced from it, that I had a know|ledge that his hou&s;e was to be burned.</P>
<P>But the publication of Bradford had appeared, and fixed up|on me, &s;o far as the publication could have credit, at lea&s;t a privity with the expul&s;ion, and a &s;upport of it. The army was now at Bedford and Cumberland, and the enquiries, with re|&s;pect to me, were, Whether I had left the country? or was it probable I would remain until they could get me in their pow|er? It &s;eemed to be a conte&s;t among&s;t them, who &s;hould have the honour of di&s;patching me. I conceived, that the example of the Jacobins in France had infected the ma&s;s of the army, ju&s;t as much as it had the people here, in Tom the Tinker's time; and I thought it not at all improbable that I &s;hould be a&s;|&s;a&s;&s;inated. It appeared to me expedient, to addre&s;s letters to &s;ome of the principal officers; &s;tating my apprehen&s;ions, and repre&s;enting the di&s;grace that it would bring upon their march, to injure a man who was, and in due time would appear to be, innocent; giving them al&s;o to under&s;tand, that I remained in the country, was ready to re&s;ign my&s;elf to the cognizance of the laws, and made no claim to an amne&s;ty, if I &s;tood in need of any. I had written a number of letters to principal officers, to this effect; but I reflected, that individual officers might not like to be addre&s;&s;ed by me, in my pre&s;ent &s;ituation. It would argue a confidence repo&s;ed in them, from per&s;onal acquaintance, which it would plea&s;e them as well to keep out of view at pre|&s;ent. Be&s;ides, I did not &s;ee well what officers could do. My fate would mo&s;t probably come from the corps of hor&s;e, that would come on fir&s;t. The&s;e e&s;pecially, were compo&s;ed of in|dividuals, in the capacity of common &s;oldiers, equal, in all re|&s;pects, to tho&s;e con&s;tituted officers. It would depend upon the &s;entiments of the ma&s;s, more than the di&s;cipline of officers, with regard to me. It &s;truck me, therefore, to addre&s;s the army generally, in a hand-bill, which would be circulated through the whole body; whereas, if I addre&s;&s;ed individuals, my letters could not be generally communicated, in order to correct in any degree the fal&s;e &s;entiments entertained of me, or to avert the intention of putting me to death, without enquiry. Under this idea, I drew up a &s;hort addre&s;s <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><LETTER>

with &s;ome hundred hand-bills, to commi&s;&s;ioner Reddick and o|thers, who had been appointed from the la&s;t meeting at Par|kin&s;on's, to wait again upon the Pre&s;ident, or other command|ing officer with the army, in order to lay the &s;tate of the coun|try before them. The army had moved from Bedford and Cum|berland, and were met by our commi&s;&s;ioners the march of a day or two from the country. My direction to our commi&s;&s;ioners, to whom I had tran&s;mitted my hand-bills, was, to deliver them to the commanding officers of the different parts of the army, to be by them di&s;tributed, if they thought proper, among&s;t the troops.

The Pre&s;ident had returned to Philadelphia. I was informed by letter, from commi&s;&s;ioner Reddick, that fame had not at all exaggerated the fury of the army again&s;t me; and there would appear to be no individual, even of tho&s;e highe&s;t in command, who appeared di&s;po&s;ed to have any &s;olicitude on my account, or at lea&s;t to be willing to have it thought they had any; that governor Howell, on receiving my hand-bills, threw&punc; them in&s;tantly into the fire; that Mifflin and Lee had given feeble a&s;&s;urances, that I &s;hould be per&s;onally &s;afe;&mdash;but that he him&s;elf, Mr. Reddick, in order to &s;erve me, had contrived that &s;ome of the hand-bills &s;hould find their way among&s;t the troops, without going through the hands of the officers. I di&s;approved of the having done this; for I knew that offence would be ex|tracted from every thing po&s;&s;ible, and that the officers would &s;ay this was wrong. It was &s;aid to be wrong; and I began to be
<PB N="53" REF="028332_0170_0FD88585BB6E4B60">
charged with &s;tupidity, as well as villany, in not knowing bet|ter than to &s;end forward papers among&s;t the ranks of an army. I was blamed for addre&s;&s;ing them at all. I had con&s;idered this army as con&s;i&s;ting of citizens, and I did not conceive any greater impropriety, in addre&s;&s;ing them in a camp, by a hand-bill, than in their counting-hou&s;es, or upon their farms, in the gazette of Philadelphia, Trenton, or Richmond. But I was unpopular; I was under the imputation of being a traitor to my country; if I was not hanged, I de&s;erved to be hanged; and it was im|material what I &s;aid or did, it would be taken in bad part. It was &s;aid, it was a damnable impertinence in me, to have the a&s;&s;urance to write or &s;peak a word to any body. I &s;carcely knew whether to laugh or indulge chagrin at the ab&s;urdity of &s;uch &s;peeches. I had thought the recent in&s;tances in France, of men being run down by the clamour of an occa&s;ion, and murdered without an opportunity of ju&s;tifying them&s;elves, might have corrected &s;uch precipitancy in the American mind.</P>
<P>The deputation of commi&s;&s;ioners from the country, had not an&s;wered the end of arre&s;ting the march of the army, by a&s;&s;ur|ances of the re&s;toration of tranquillity, and obedience to the laws. The Pre&s;ident had &s;een things from a different point of view with me, and had not thought him&s;elf ju&s;tifiable in &s;u&s;|pending the march. I pre&s;ume, he had not a perfect con|fidence in the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of the people. It would &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">em &s;o from the circum&s;tance of &s;pies traver&s;ing the country&punc; at this time, in order to gain intelligence on which he could better de|pend, than on the repre&s;entations of our commi&s;&s;ioners. I pre&s;ume he al&s;o conceived, that the exhibiting &s;o formidable a force in the country, would leave an impre&s;&s;ion of fear; the be&s;t &s;ecurity, in his opinion, again&s;t future oppo&s;ition to the laws. It would take away effectually, the &s;aying hereafter, that the militia could not have &s;u&s;tained a march acro&s;s &s;o va&s;t a mountain. The difference of expence would be little; as the equipments and appointments for the army had been made, &s;tores and every requi&s;ite provided, and the troops might as well be marching into the country, as remaining at di&s;tant points, until the judiciary had advanced, and fini&s;hed their examinations and arre&s;ts in the country. It would have a good effect in o|ther parts of the union, where a &s;pirit of in&s;urrection might exi&s;t, to hear that an army had cro&s;&s;ed even the Allegheny mountain, to the heads of the waters that run to the we&s;t, in order to cru&s;h the in&s;urgency, that had &s;hewn it&s;elf in that re|mote &s;kirt of the government. It would have a good effect in
<PB N="54" REF="028332_0171_0FD8996BC0109A00">
Europe, and re&s;tore that confidence in the government, which had been le&s;&s;ened by the report of the di&s;turbance of the &s;ummer. Finally, a great part of the army were anxious to &s;ee the we&s;t|ern country, and they might as well come on embodied as they were.</P>
<P>The right wing of the army had now cro&s;&s;ed the mountain, and were in the we&s;tern country. It was like the approach of a tempe&s;t to me. I could hear the thunder at a di&s;tance; eve|ry day new accounts of butchery denounced again&s;t me, without judge or jury. I began to hear general Neville rai&s;e his voice; "the damnede&s;t ra&s;cal that ever was on GOD Almighty's earth."</P>
<P>The left wing had al&s;o cro&s;&s;ed the mountain, at the di&s;tance of 30 miles to the we&s;tward. I could hear of colonel Neville at the table of general Lee, and publickly el&s;ewhere, through that camp, denounce revenge again&s;t the "damned ra&s;cal," meaning me.</P>
<P>I began to think it would be un&s;afe to &s;tand it: that I could not have &s;ufficient confidence in the good di&s;po&s;ition of the com|manding officers, much le&s;s in their power, to re&s;train injuries; and that it would be advi&s;eable to be out of the way a little, until I could &s;ee whether &s;ubordination to the civil authority; wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> re&s;ervable or not. I had the wilderne&s;s behind me; and, as before, I had meditated to e&s;cape from Tom the Tinker, by going to the ea&s;t, &s;o now, I meditated to e&s;cape from an equal|ly outrageous banditti, as I began to think them, by going to the we&s;t. My &s;en&s;ations were violent at the time, but they ought to be excu&s;ed, as I mu&s;t have thought it very extraordinary in people, to have come to &s;upport the laws, and to be talking of violating them. I communicated to general Wilkins my re|&s;olution of going, neither to Spainards, nor Briti&s;h, but of tak|ing my chance among&s;t the Indians, for a month or two, until I could have a proper a&s;&s;urance of protection, in &s;urrendering my&s;elf to the judiciary authority. I had thought of a hunter, whom I could employ to go to the woods with me.</P>
<P>General Wilkins could not but acknowledge the expediency of going, from all that he had heard or &s;een, and propo&s;ed a hunter, whom he knew, and thought more expert, than the one of whom I had made mention; and engaged to &s;peak to him to go with me. He was to &s;end for him next morning.</P>
<P>I lay upon a couch, and thought of it till midnight. I re|flected that people would always talk more than they would do; and that putting me to death would be more in the language,
<PB N="55" REF="028332_0172_0FD8996D152D91E0">
than in the intention of the ma&s;s. It was the fa&s;hionable &s;peech of the camp, and every one adopted it; without meaning to carry it into effect. But I reflected al&s;o, that this very &s;train of talking, though not originating from intention of act, with the ma&s;s, yet might lead &s;ome incon&s;iderate and unprincipled men, to perpetrate what they heard &s;poken of; more e&s;pecially as I had heard of the violence of the Nevilles, and &s;u&s;pected that the horrid re&s;entment, which they appear to entertain again&s;t me, might prompt them to encourage a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination.</P>
<P>However, after the deep thought of many hours, I &s;prung from my bed couch, and expre&s;&s;ed my determination, that if I was to be a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated, it &s;hould be in my own hou&s;e. It never &s;hould be &s;aid, that I would move a foot from the ground; more e&s;pecially as in my addre&s;s to the army, I &s;aid I would not. It was true, I made that declaration, at the time, under the impre&s;&s;ion that my addre&s;s would be read, and all idea of per&s;onal injury would be relinqui&s;hed, and the examination of my conduct left to the judiciary, under the avowal which I made, of putting my&s;elf entirely upon the merit, or demerit of of it; meaning that I &s;hould &s;et up no claim to the amne&s;ty, of which it might be &s;uppo&s;ed I would be willing to avail my&s;elf.</P>
<P>Having now determined to await my fate, I employed a day or two in putting my papers in order, and making a &s;hort &s;ketch of the outlines of my conduct, during the in&s;urrection, and di|recting it to be deli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ered to James Ro&s;s, who know the great|er part, of his own knowledge, with a reque&s;t that he would &s;ta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">o the public, and do my memory ju&s;tice. I knew the rage again&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e was founded in the mi&s;conception of the multi|tude, and the malice of individuals. But it was what had hap|pened to others in other times, and would happen a thou&s;and times again. It had been the ca&s;e of La Rochefoucaut, Cler|mont de Tonnere, and others, at an early period of the French revolution.</P>
<P>About this time Jo&s;iah Tannehil, an a&s;&s;i&s;tant burge&s;s of Pitt&s;|burgh came to me, and mentioned the name of my brother of the bar, &s;aid he, he has di&s;covered &mdash;. What? &s;aid I, the longitude? No, &s;aid he, but that you are not within the am|ne&s;ty, you did not &s;ign upon the day. Is that all? &s;aid I, that will not do me any harm.</P>
<P>The event of the election had incen&s;ed my brother of the bar &s;till more, if po&s;&s;ible, than he was before. From a want of de|licacy, or a defect of education, he values him&s;elf upon the ap|plication of force, and will talk familiarly of knocking down a
<PB N="56" REF="028332_0173_0FD8996E6DED1098">
man. I had heard that he had talked of having recour&s;e to this mode of &s;hewing his &s;uperiority over me. If he was not &s;o popular, he would convince the people that he was &s;tronger, and more ferocious. However, he had lo&s;t &s;ight of this, when the pro&s;pect appeared of having me a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated by the army, the propriety of which he &s;trenuou&s;ly advocated, and conceived, that the army might ju&s;tifiably do that, en ma&s;&s;e, which every individual would be ju&s;tified in doing by him&s;elf, upon &s;o hor|rid an in&s;urgent as I was. He had, no doubt, been bu&s;y in im|pre&s;&s;ing this idea, by all avenues, by which he could po&s;&s;ibly reach the army. But on di&s;covering that I was not, in &s;trict|ne&s;s, within the amne&s;ty, and beginning to believe that, with good management, &s;omething might be done with me with the judiciary, he had relinqui&s;hed the idea of a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination, and con|templated the more di&s;graceful con&s;equence to me, the being ig|nominiou&s;ly arre&s;ted, and tried at the bar for high trea&s;on.</P>
<P>I had no idea that it had been any &s;ecret before, that I had not &s;igned on the day. I had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ever thought of an amne&s;ty. I would have re&s;ented it as an indignity, to have it &s;uppo&s;ed that I did. I had &s;igned upon the principles I have &s;tated in my narrative.</P>
<P>It &s;truck me, as fortunate, that my brother of the bar had fa&s;tened upon this. He would communicate the circum&s;tance to the Nevilles with the army, and that would change their views, with regard to the mode of proceeding again&s;t me; and in&s;tead of getting the father-in-law, general Morgan's dragoons, to put me to death privately, would lead them to a&s;&s;ail the judi|ciary with accu&s;ations, and to u&s;e all addre&s;s, influence, and indu&s;try, to collect or make te&s;timony.</P>
<P>It was preci&s;ely as I had fore&s;een. Accounts from the ar|my, of the language of the Nevilles, now began to be, that of having me hung. I was diverted with a &s;peech of general Ne|ville's, reported to me: When &s;ome of the people, alarmed for their &s;ituation, had gone forward to &s;olicit his favour; Children, &s;aid he, it is not you we want; it is &s;ome of the "big fi&s;h," Brack|enridge, Gallatin, and Findley, that we want. Thought I, it is high enough to expect to find me in the &s;ame &s;hoal of fi&s;h with Gallatin and Findley, when I have had a political difference with Findley, that has produced a di&s;tance, which &s;till exi&s;ts; and when I have never &s;poke to Gallatin in my life, that I recol|lect, until I &s;aw him at Parkin&s;on's ferry. But the fact was, Findley and Gallatin were obnoxious, perhaps with the judi|ciary, but certainly with &s;ecretary Hamilton, who acted in aid
<PB N="57" REF="028332_0174_0FD899732E718AA8">
of the judiciary in the examination of witne&s;&s;es; and it would have a good effect to involve me in the odium of Gallatin and Findley. I give credit to the ingenuity of the old general in this.</P>
<P>Willing to avoid the circum&s;tance of an arre&s;t, in any humi|liating way, I had prepared a letter to judge Peters, giving him to under&s;tand, that whether within the amne&s;ty or not, I was ready to di&s;claim it; and had a right to do this, under the princi|ple, <HI>Juri pro &s;e introducto qui&s;quis renunciari pote&s;t;</HI> every man may renounce a privilege that has been &s;pecially given him; but that it would not be nece&s;&s;ary to wound my feelings, by di&s;|patching troops to arre&s;t me. I would come forward upon a moment's notice, or I would remain, and be ready to &s;urren|der my&s;elf at Pitt&s;burgh, when they &s;hould come forward to that place.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time, I had prepared a paragraph for the ga|zette, calling upon all good citizens, who knew any thing of trea&s;onable actions, &s;peeches, &s;editious writings, or mi&s;demean|ors of any kind, cognizable by the judiciary of the United States, by me done, &s;aid, or written, to come forward, and give their te&s;timony to the judiciary, then in the country, and ready to hear them. Commi&s;&s;ioner Ro&s;s was at this time in Pitt&s;burgh, and was about to &s;et out to the army. I &s;hewed him my letter to judge Peters, and my adverti&s;ement, which I was about to in&s;ert in the gazette; and I reque&s;ted him to bear my letter to judge Peters. He made this remark, that, in his opinion, the true medium was, on the one hand, not to court a pro&s;ecution; on the other, not to fear it. I thought the ob&s;ervation &s;olid; and I reflected, that I have been always di&s;&s;at<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">fied with the pe|tulence of per&s;ons accu&s;ed, as if they were willing to derive po|pularity from a pro&s;ecution; and it had &s;truck me, as more dignified, to con&s;ider it, as it really was, a great misfortune, but, at the &s;ame time, to bear it with mode&s;ty and firmne&s;s.</P>
<P>James Ro&s;s undertook to mention it to the judiciary, that I was ready to &s;urrender my&s;elf, and would pledge his honour, that I would not remove from the town, or avoid an inqui&s;ition, This, he pre&s;umed, would &s;uper&s;ede the arre&s;ting me with any ignominious circum&s;tances; a thing which it was po&s;&s;ible my e|nemies would endeavour to accompli&s;h, in order to have that gratification, if they could obtain nothing more. On this, I laid a&s;ide my letter to the judge, and my paragraph for the ga|zette.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IX.</HEAD>
<P>MY brother of the bar had gone to the camp, and had en|tered upon his office of &s;olicitor of te&s;timony again&s;t me. The ju&s;tice of the peace, on who&s;e paper of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion I had put my name, had been called before the judiciary, in order to a&s;cer|tain the fact, that I was not within the amne&s;ty. It was a&s;cer|tained; and now the field was open for accu&s;ation. In the ex|amination of all witne&s;&s;es, the great burden of the &s;ong was, "What do you know of Brackenridge?" I knew well that &s;e|cretary Hamilton would have a predi&s;po&s;ition again&s;t me. He would rather find the oppo&s;ition to the law to have originated in the plan of &s;ome leading individuals, than with the ma&s;s of the people: for the exci&s;e law being a re&s;ult of the funding &s;y&s;|tem, of which the &s;ecretary was an advocate, it would &s;ave the pride of judgment, to have it thought oppo&s;ed by the &s;editious arts of one, or a few, rather than by the feelings or common &s;en&s;e of many. I reflected al&s;o, that the &s;ecretary would have ob&s;erved, in my letter to Tench Coxe, and in &s;ome other pub|lications, that I was not a friend to the funding &s;y&s;tem it&s;elf. And this, even with a man of integrity, would con&s;titute a bi|as imperceptible to him&s;elf; and I was &s;en&s;ible, that the o|pinion of the &s;ecretary, in my ca&s;e, would have weight with the judiciary.</P>
<P>Judge Peters I knew to have no prejudice again&s;t me; and I did not conceive that Rawle had any; but as the army were vociferous to have me made a victim, there would naturally &s;pring up, in the minds of both, an inclination to gratify them.</P>
<P>But with the &s;ecretary and judiciary, the wi&s;hes of the Ne|villes connections, who were con&s;idered as martyrs to the gov|ernment, would have an almo&s;t irre&s;i&s;tible influence. I reflect|ed, that the drift of my &s;peech at the Mingo meeting-hou&s;e, might not have been fully under&s;tood by all; but more e&s;peci|ally my management at Parkin&s;on's ferry, the fir&s;t meeting, was not under&s;tood generally, for it was not my wi&s;h that it &s;hould be generally under&s;tood, and therefore the te&s;timony that would of cour&s;e come forward, with regard to what was &s;aid or done on the&s;e occa&s;ions, would place my conduct in an equivocal, if
<PB N="59" REF="028332_0176_0FD899776DE44698">
not in a criminal point of view. When I add to this, the lean|ing that per&s;ons, con&s;cious of criminality, would have to gra|tify the government, by te&s;timony again&s;t a character that was to be run down, in order to gain favour for them&s;elves, I thought an arre&s;t not improbable. But when I al&s;o took into view, the pro&s;pect of favour with government, as to offices, of which it would be &s;uppo&s;ed the Nevilles connection would have now the di&s;tribution, and that an oath, on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, would go a great way to recommend, I thought my arre&s;t certain.</P>
<P>My adver&s;aries con&s;idered them&s;elves as having lo&s;t a great deal, in the departure of Bradford. On the return of the fir&s;t commi&s;&s;ioners, Reddick and Findley, he had been informed of an ob&s;ervation of the Pre&s;ident, on the commi&s;&s;ioners repre|&s;enting, that all the principal actors had taken the benefit of the amne&s;ty; We have heard, &s;aid he, of inflammatory &s;peeches made after the 22d day of Augu&s;t <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The amne&s;ty re&s;pected only what was done before this day.</NOTE>. It was under&s;tood by them, that this had a reference to Bradford: it was on this that he thought proper to abandon the country. If he had known the arrangements that had been made on his behalf, by &s;ome of my adver&s;aries, he would perhaps have &s;taid at home. The way had been prepared: it had been given out, that he was a weak man; that he had been gulled into the bu&s;ine&s;s; that he had been &s;et up as a thing to be &s;hot at, by &s;ome be|hind the &s;cene; that I was the manager of the puppet &s;hew; the mo&s;t dangerous per&s;on to the government on the we&s;t of the mountain; that Gallatin and Findley were nothing to me. I will not charge the Nevilles with devi&s;ing this; it was the plan of my brother of the bar. The letter of Craig to Bradford, in&s;inuating <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P><Q>I would not have addre&s;&s;ed you on the &s;ubject, had I not &s;uppo&s;ed that you were deceived in your information.</Q></P></NOTE> that it was not &s;uppo&s;eable that he could do or &s;ay any thing ami&s;s, gives a key to the &s;y&s;tem of making u&s;e of him. He was to be repre&s;ented to the &s;ecretary as deceived, mi&s;led by an artful and de&s;igning man, whom they wi&s;hed hang|ed in his place. The Nevilles had been brought into it, and begun to adopt the language &s;uitable to the occa&s;ion, and which continues to be the rhyme yet, that Bradford was gulled.</P>
<P>In the mean time, a detachment of hor&s;e, e&s;corting general Gib&s;on, who had been exiled, arrived at Pitt&s;burgh. They were under the command of corporal Cunningham, a merchant of Philadelphia. He had given orders not to &s;peak to me. I
<PB N="60" REF="028332_0177_0FD89979AFDDDC48">
had &s;uppo&s;ed, that general Gib&s;on, who had been acquainted with the commencement of the in&s;urrection, would have ex|plained to them the mi&s;take under which they had laboured with regard to me. I had heard of him, as the only one of the exiles who had the candour to do me ju&s;tice, on his way out of the country. It is probable he had given his opinion favourably, with regard to what had happened before he went away; but it might be &s;uppo&s;ed, that I had acted a different part afterwards. I reflected on my &s;olicitude on his account, at the time of the expul&s;ion<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Meetkirk's depo&s;ition in the appendix, and John Scull's, and others.</NOTE>, when I &s;aw him pa&s;s by my hou&s;e, with the dragoons of his train, looking up, and laughing; as much as to &s;ay, "There lives a fellow that is to be hanged." He ought to have recollected, that he was chairman of the com|mittee that exiled the fir&s;t three. But Gib&s;on is far from be|ing an unfeeling or unju&s;t man, but he was under the nece&s;&s;ity of giving way to the current again&s;t me; it was too &s;trong to be &s;temmed. He did go &s;o far as to &s;ay, that all things con&s;ider|ed, he could not conceive me to be &s;o much concerned in the in&s;urrection as I was &s;uppo&s;ed to be.</P>
<P>The next detachment that arrived, was an e&s;cort of three or four &s;quadrons of hor&s;e, conducting, in great pomp, the young|er Neville. General Morgan him&s;elf was along. They &s;hewed them&s;elves on the &s;outhern bank of the Monongahela; they cro&s;&s;ed the river; the &s;tandards were unfurled, and the cornets blew their horns; the guns of the garri&s;on were di&s;charged;&mdash; it was like a Roman ovation, a &s;pecies of the le&s;&s;er triumph.</P>
<P>General Morgan, in the evening, accompanied by his &s;uite, and parading near my hou&s;e, with a military gait, was heard to &s;ay, "Hang the ra&s;cal, hang him."</P>
<P>After night, I was informed by my &s;ervants, that &s;ome of the dragoons were occa&s;ionally coming and going, and watching the avenues to the hou&s;e; and that two of them had come into the kitchen, and looked into the adjoining rooms. About 9 o'clock, I had farther information, that two of them had been in the yard, and had gone away. This did not &s;trike me much; I re&s;olved it into curio&s;ity, or an intention of plundering &s;ome|thing. They would naturally think it could be no great harm to make free with the property of an in&s;urgent.</P>
<P>However, the danger was greater than I had imagined; that night, about eleven o'clock, I was to have been a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated. The troops had advanced within 20 yards of my door, when an
<PB N="61" REF="028332_0178_0FD8997E3B4022F8">
officer, who had been appri&s;ed of their intention, and in vain laboured to di&s;&s;uade them, having run to general Morgan, who was in the hou&s;e of Neville the younger, and not gone to bed, gave him information. The general and the colonel ran out without their hats, and the general oppo&s;ing him&s;elf to the fury of the troops, &s;aid, "That it mu&s;t be through him they would reach me;" that I had &s;tood my ground; would be cognizable by the judiciary; and let the law take its cour&s;e.</P>
<P>I had di&s;mi&s;&s;ed all apprehen&s;ions of a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination; conceiving that my adver&s;aries had turned their attention to a legal pro&s;e|cution. It was not until two or three days afterwards, that I heard of the attempt of the troops of cavalry. I had thought my&s;elf perfectly &s;ecure, at all events, from a detachment under the immediate command of the general, and who had e&s;corted his &s;on-in-law, becau&s;e the murder would be immediately attri|buted to them; and a regard for their own honour, indepen|dent of all principles of humanity, would lead them to avoid the perpetration at that time; and if any thing was to be executed, let it be by a detachment from &s;ome other corps, at another time. I will not &s;ay, that the Nevilles were u&s;ually capable of deliber|ately contemplating the putting me to death. The father is outrageou&s;ly pa&s;&s;ionate, but not vindictive or cruel; the &s;on is a man of good temper, and humanity; but they laboured un|der irremoveable mi&s;conceptions, owing to a variety of circum|&s;tances; and their pride had al&s;o been wounded by acts of mine, which I thought virtuous, and think &s;o &s;till. My brother of the bar had all hell in his bo&s;om; and had it not been for the pro&s;pect of hanging me, would have &s;truggled hard to have me murdered. And I knew well, that the mi&s;conception of the Nevilles had been, in a great degree, originally e&s;tabli&s;hed by him; and that their rage had been fanned by his information. He was now bu&s;y at the camp, with general Neville. The general, who had been a &s;ubject of the outrages, was there in the light of a private pro&s;ecutor; and in aid of the judiciary, was a&s;&s;i&s;ting in bringing forward and interrogating witne&s;&s;es. My brother of the bar was active in &s;ounding, embracing, and mar|&s;halling them; and if, on examination, any thing was omitted by the judiciary, he took the general a&s;ide, and gave him a hint of it. The general would then return to the charge with fre&s;h que&s;tions. This is the account that I have from witne&s;&s;es that were examined, or from gentlemen occa&s;ionally pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>When the matter was thought to be pretty well fixed again&s;t me, the great and concluding &s;troke was to be given. A trea|&s;onable

letter of mine, addre&s;&s;ed to a certain Bradford, had fal|len into the hands of my adver&s;aries. It was dark and my&s;te|rious, and re&s;pected certain papers, a duplicate of which I wi&s;h|ed him to &s;end me, having mi&s;laid the fir&s;t copy; that the&s;e were &s;o e&s;&s;ential, I could not go on with the bu&s;ine&s;s without them. This letter was now brought forward. What do you make of that? &s;aid &s;ecretary Hamilton to James Ro&s;s, who was pre&s;ent: you have averred, as your opinion, that Brackenridge has had no corre&s;pondence with Bradford; look at that, is it not the hand-writing of Brackenridge? It is the hand-writing, &s;aid James Ro&s;s, pau&s;ing for &s;ome time; and there is only this &s;mall matter ob&s;ervable in the ca&s;e, that it is addre&s;&s;ed to William Bradford, attorney general of the United States, not to David Bradford <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It was wrote to the attorney general, William Bradford, when com|mi&s;&s;ioner at Pitt&s;burgh, when I was &s;uperintending the publi&s;hing the report to be made of the corre&s;pnodence of the committee of twelve and the com|mi&s;&s;ioners. I wrote to him, reque&s;ting &s;ome of the papers that were to be in&s;erted. This note had been dropped at the public hou&s;e, and picked up by my adver&s;aries. They were in &s;uch a hurry to believe every thing again&s;t me, that they had not taken time to examine it with attention. I pre&s;ume, major Craig, <HI>virtute officii,</HI> as notary public, had picked it up.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>When a bla&s;t, tran&s;ver&s;e, takes a &s;hallop on the river, and throws her on her beam ends, with all her &s;ails &s;et; or when a &s;end of wind takes the &s;tanding corn of the farmer, and on the field bows the &s;talks to the earth, &s;o langui&s;hed my brother of the bar. The old general &s;tood motionle&s;s and &s;peechle&s;s, and to this hour had been &s;tanding, had not &s;ecretary Hamilton broke &s;ilence. "Gentlemen, &s;aid he, you are too fa&s;t; this will not do."</P>
<P>The late circum&s;tance had weakened the credit of the pro&s;e|cution; and all things con&s;idered, e&s;pecially when James Ro&s;s was examined, it began to be doubted whether it would be for the honour of the government to pro&s;ecute me. However, the ca&s;e remained open for farther te&s;timony.</P>
<P>It was not until a con&s;iderable time afterwards, that I had information of this indi&s;creet zeal on the part of the pro&s;ecution. I had heard all that I had apprehended confirmed; viz. that there was the &s;tronge&s;t di&s;po&s;ition with the judiciary, and thro' all the branches of the a&s;&s;i&s;tant examiner to find ground of ar|re&s;ting me. This was &s;o &s;trikingly ob&s;erv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ble by the country, that it quite re&s;tored me in their good opinion; and if the elec|tion had been to take place then, there would have been no
<PB N="63" REF="028332_0180_0FD88587E7783F80">
que&s;tion of my having their &s;uffrages. They were &s;atisfied they had wronged me, in &s;uppo&s;ing that I had &s;tipulated any indemnity for my&s;elf in particular; or had made fair weather with the gov|ernment, by de&s;erting them. I had nothing to fear from the body of the people, they would rather lean in my favour; but there were &s;till enough of unprincipled per&s;ons, that might be brought for|ward, or who would offer them&s;elves in order to obtain favour. It was amu&s;ing to me, to &s;ee the numbers of tho&s;e coming for|ward, and pa&s;&s;ing them&s;elves for friends of government, whom, during the in&s;urrection, I had a great deal of trouble to keep down. They took their revenge now, and joined in the cry again&s;t Brackenridge.</P>
<P>Some poor fellows did this to &s;ave them&s;elves; I had given them leave to do it. They came to me, with tears in their eyes, to con&s;ult whether they would go off or not, or &s;tand trial. The army had then cro&s;&s;ed the mountain. I directed them to con|trive to let my brother of the bar hear them cur&s;e me, and &s;ay they had voted again&s;t me at the election; this would be carried to the ear of my adver&s;aries, and they would be repre&s;ented as friends of government. They did &s;o; and it had the effect.</P>
<P>At the time I had given this advice, I had dreaded nothing but an a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination; I had no idea of having any thing to fear from a judiciary proce&s;s. Now I began to apprehend danger from this &s;ource. I looked forward to a trial before a jury, in Phila|delphia; which, heated with prejudice again&s;t me, would differ little from a revolutionary tribunal of Paris. Be&s;ides, the part I had been drawn in to act, was &s;o various, and of &s;uch a na|ture, that it would take a multitude of witne&s;&s;es to explain the quo animo; and the expences of a trial would ruin me. But, what alarmed me &s;till more, from a &s;troke that I received from a &s;edentary life, twenty years ago, I am &s;ubject to a delinquen|cy or &s;ailing of nerves, e&s;pecially when any thing affects my mind; and I was afraid that my feelings would kill me, under a &s;en&s;e of the arts that were practi&s;ing again&s;t me. I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">e it with apparent fortitude, but my &s;en&s;ibility was greatly affected. Not that I was uncommonly afraid of death; but I recorded my memory for the &s;ake of my family, and was apprehen&s;ive, that if I &s;unk under the &s;en&s;ibility of my affections, it would be re&s;olved into a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of guilt, and not into the pain which the ingenuous mind feels when it is wronged by the world.</P>
<P>It may &s;eem to reflect upon the judiciary, to have it &s;uppo&s;ed that they would give &s;o facile an ear to general Neville, as may &s;eem to have been in&s;inuated. Let it be con&s;idered, that
<PB N="64" REF="028332_0181_0FD899818C771210">
they would find, in the cour&s;e of their examination, that even at the burning of the hou&s;e of the in&s;pector, there were per|&s;ons who had been under the impul&s;e of fear for them&s;elves, and were carried there by con&s;traint. But more e&s;pecially at Brad|dock's fields <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I knew a man, nearly related to me, on B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;hy Run, in Wa&s;hington county, who, having no gun, &s;at two nights in his cabin with his axe in his hand, to defend him&s;elf again&s;t his captain, of the name of Sharp, who had threatened his life, for not going to the burning of Neville's hou&s;e, agree|able to &s;ummons. He yielded on the order to go to Braddock's field, and appeared there with a crooked horn by his &s;ide, but had no powder in it. He &s;aw, as he went along, the tomahawk drawn over the heads of men, at their breakfa&s;t, or dinner, and obliged to march.</NOTE>, many were pre&s;ent under compul&s;ion; and thro' the &s;cene in general, men were obliged to pretend to be what they were not. The quo animo, therefore, was to be deter|mined, a good deal, from what had been known to be their &s;en|timents and conduct heretofore. To whom could this be refer|red better, than to the in&s;pector of the revenue, who knew the people? and this gave him an unlimited influence in his re|pre&s;entations. I have no di&s;po&s;ition to be di&s;&s;atisfied with the u&s;e the in&s;pector made of this advantage, in &s;aving individuals; I wi&s;h I could equally excu&s;e the u&s;e he made of it in pro&s;ecut|ing others. I can only &s;often my cen&s;ure, by acknowledging that, &s;o far as I have heard, he exerci&s;ed favour in more in|&s;tances than prejudice. But in both ca&s;es, he mu&s;t be con&s;i|dered as having mi&s;led the judiciary; and though my ob&s;erva|tion may help him as a man, it mu&s;t hurt him as a pro&s;ecutor. It would have been better he could have declined his attend|ance on the examinations; to have been e&s;corted to his hou&s;e, at an early period, and to have remained there; leaving the judicial inve&s;tigation to an operation unbia&s;&s;ed by him; &s;o as not only to avoid the influence of opinion, but the &s;u&s;picion of it. But this is a delicacy which the noble mind alone has from nature, or which a refined education gives.</P>

<P>THE in&s;tructions from the Pre&s;ident to governor Lee, the commander in chief, are greatly excellent; and the governor had conducted him&s;elf, agreeably to the&s;e in&s;tructions, with great propriety and delicacy <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><LETTER>
<HEAD>INSTRUCTIONS to Governor LEE.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Bedford,</HI>
<DATE>20<HI>th October,</HI> 1794.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I have it in &s;pecial in&s;truction from the Pre&s;ident of the United States, now at this place, to convey to you, on his behalf, the following in&s;truc|tions, for the general direction of your conduct, in the command of the mi|litia army, with which you are charged.</P>
<P>The objects for which the militia have been called forth, are,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. To &s;uppre&s;s the combinations which exi&s;t in &s;ome of the we&s;tern coun|ties of Penn&s;ylvania, in oppo&s;ition to the laws laying duties upon &s;pirits di&s;|tilled within the United States, and upon the &s;tills.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. To cau&s;e the laws to be executed.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>The&s;e objects are to be effected in two ways:
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. By military force.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. By judiciary proce&s;s, and other civil proceedings.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>The objects of the military force are twofold:
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. To overcome any armed oppo&s;ition which may exi&s;t.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. To countenance and &s;upport the civil officers in the means of executing the laws.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>With a view to the fir&s;t of the&s;e two objects, you will proceed as &s;peedily as may be, with the army under your command, into the in&s;urgent coun|ties, to attack, and, as far as &s;hall be in your power, &s;ubdue, all per&s;ons whom you may find in arms, in oppo&s;ition to the laws above mentioned. You will march your army in two columns, from the places where they are now a&s;&s;embled, by the mo&s;t convenient routes; having regard to the nature of roads, the convenience of &s;upply, and the facility of co-operation and union; and bearing in mind, that you ought to act, until the contrary &s;hall be ful|ly developed, on the general principle, of having to contend with the whole force of the counties of Fayette, We&s;tmoreland, Wa&s;hington, and Alleghe|ny, and of that part of Bedford which lies we&s;tward of the town of Bedford; and that you are to put as little as po&s;&s;ible to hazard. The approximation, therefore, of your columns, is to be &s;ought; and the &s;ubdivi&s;ion of them, &s;o as to place the parts out of mutual &s;upporting di&s;tance, to be avoided, as far as local circum&s;tances will permit. Parkin&s;on's ferry appears to be a proper point, towards which to direct the march of the columns, for ulte|rior mea&s;ures.</P>
<P>When arrived within the in&s;urgent country, if an armed oppo&s;ition ap|pear, it may be proper to publi&s;h a proclamation, inviting all good citizens, friends to the con&s;titution and laws, to join the &s;tandard of the United States. If no armed oppo&s;ition exi&s;t, it may be &s;till proper to publi&s;h a pro|clamation, exhorting to a peaceable and dutiful demeanor, and giving a&s;|&s;urances of performing, with good faith and liberality, what&s;oever may have been promi&s;ed by the commi&s;&s;ioners, to tho&s;e who have complied with the conditions pre&s;cribed by them, and who have not forfeited their title by &s;ub|&s;equent mi&s;conduct.</P>
<P>Of the&s;e per&s;ons in arms, if any, whom you may make pri&s;oners; leaders, including all per&s;ons in command, are to be delivered to the civil magi&s;trate; the re&s;t to be di&s;armed, admoni&s;hed, and &s;ent home, (except &s;uch as may have been particularly violent, and al&s;o influential); cau&s;ing their own re|cognizances for their good behaviour, to be taken, in the ca&s;es in which it may be deemed expedient.</P>
<P>With a view to the &s;econd point, namely, "the countenance and &s;upport of the civil officers, in the means of executing the laws," you will make &s;uch di&s;po&s;itions as &s;hall appear proper, to countenance and protect, and, if ne|ce&s;&s;ary, and required by them, to &s;upport and aid the civil officers, in the execution of their re&s;pective duties&mdash;for bringing offenders and delinquents to ju&s;tice; for &s;eizing the &s;tills of delinquent di&s;tillers, as far as the &s;ame &s;hall be deemed eligible by the &s;upervi&s;or of the revenue, or chief officer of in&s;pection; and al&s;o for conveying to &s;afe cu&s;tody, &s;uch per&s;ons as may be apprehended, and not admitted to bail.</P>
<P>The objects of judiciary proce&s;s, and other civil proceedings, will be,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. To bring offenders to ju&s;tice.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2 To enforce penalties on delinquent di&s;tillers, by &s;uit.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. To enfore the penalty of forfeiture, on the &s;ame per&s;ons, by the &s;eiz|ure of their &s;tills and &s;pirits.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>The better to effect the&s;e purpo&s;es, the judge of the di&s;trict, Richard Pe|ters, e&s;q. and the attorney of the di&s;trict, William Rawle, e&s;q. accompa|ny the army.</P>
<P>You are aware, that the judge cannot be controlled in his functions. But I count on his di&s;po&s;ition, to co-operate in &s;uch a general plan, as &s;hall ap|pear to you con&s;i&s;tent with the policy of the ca&s;e. But your method of giv|ing a direction to legal proceedings, according to your general plan, will be by in&s;truction to the di&s;trict attorney.</P>
<P>He ought particularly to be in&s;tructed, (with due regard to time and cir|cum&s;tance), 1&s;t. To procure to be arre&s;ted, all influential actors in riots, and unlawful a&s;&s;emblies, relating to the in&s;urrection, and combinations to re&s;i&s;t the laws; or having for object, to abet that in&s;urrection, and tho&s;e com|binations; and who &s;hall not have complied with the terms offered by the commi&s;&s;ioners, or manife&s;ted their repentance in &s;ome other way, which you may deem &s;atisfactory. 2dly. To cau&s;e proce&s;s to i&s;&s;ue, for enforcing penalties upon delinquent di&s;tillers. 3d. To cau&s;e offenders, who may be arre&s;ted, to be conveyed to gaols where there will be no danger of re&s;cue&mdash; tho&s;e for mi&s;demeanors, to the gaols of York and Lanca&s;ter&mdash;tho&s;e for ca|pital offences, to the gaol of Philadelphia, as more &s;ecure than the others. 4th. To pro&s;ecute indictable offences in the courts of the United States&mdash; tho&s;e for penalties on delinquents, under the laws before mentioned, in the courts of Penn&s;ylvania.</P>
<P>As a guide in the ca&s;e, the di&s;trict attorney has with him a li&s;t of the per|&s;ons who have availed them&s;elves of the offers of the commi&s;&s;ioners, on the day appointed.</P>
<P>The &s;eizure of &s;tills, is the province of the &s;upervi&s;or, and other officers of in&s;pection. It is difficult to chalk out a preci&s;e line concerning it. There are con&s;iderations which will require to be nicely balanced, and which mu&s;t be judged of by tho&s;e officers on the &s;pot. It may be found u&s;eful, to con|fine the &s;eizures to &s;tills of the mo&s;t leading and refractory di&s;tillers. It may be advi&s;eable, to extend them far in the mo&s;t refractory county.</P>
<P>When the in&s;urrection is &s;ubdued, and the requi&s;ite means have been put in execution, to &s;ecure obedience to the laws, &s;o as to render it proper for the army to retire, (an event which you will accelerate as much as &s;hall be con&s;i&s;tent with the object), you will endeavour to make an arrangement for detaching &s;uch a force as you deem adequate, to be &s;tationed within the di&s;affected country, in &s;uch a manner as be&s;t to afford protection to well di&s;|po&s;ed citizens, and to the officers of the revenue; and to repre&s;s, by their pre&s;ence, the &s;pirit of riot and oppo&s;ition to the laws.</P>
<P>But before you withdraw the army, you will promi&s;e on behalf of the Pre&s;ident, a general pardon to all &s;uch as &s;hall not have been arre&s;ted, with &s;uch exceptions as you &s;hall deem proper. The promi&s;e mu&s;t be &s;o guarded, as not to affect pecuniary claims under the revenue laws. In this mea&s;ure, it is advi&s;eable there &s;hould be a co-operation with the governor of Penn|&s;ylvania.</P>
<P>On the return of the army, you will adopt &s;ome convenient and certain arrangement, for re&s;toring to the public magazines, the arms, accoutre|ments, military &s;tores, tents, and other articles of camp equipage, and en|trenching tools, which have been furni&s;hed, and &s;hall not have been con&s;um|ed or lo&s;t.</P>
<P>You are to exert your&s;elf, by all po&s;&s;ible means, to pre&s;erve di&s;cipline a|mong&s;t the troops; particularly a &s;crupulous regard to the rights of per&s;ons and property, and a re&s;pect for the authority of the civil magi&s;trate; taking e&s;pecial care to inculcate, and cau&s;e to be ob&s;erved, this principle,&mdash;that the duties of the army are confined to the attacking and &s;ubduing of armed opponents of the laws, and to the &s;upporting and aiding of the civil officers, in the execution of their functions.</P>
<P>It has been &s;ettled, that the governor of Penn&s;ylvania will be &s;econd, the governor of New-Jer&s;ey third in command; and that the troops of the &s;e|veral &s;tates, in line, on the march, and upon detachment, are to be po&s;ted according to the rule which prevailed in the army during the late war,&mdash; namely, in moving towards the &s;ea-board, the mo&s;t &s;outhern troops will take the right,&mdash;in moving we&s;tward, the mo&s;t northern troops will take the right.</P>
<P>The&s;e general in&s;tructions, however, are to be con&s;idered as liable to &s;uch alterations and deviations in the detail, as from local and other cau&s;es may be found nece&s;&s;ary, the better to effect the main object, upon the ge|neral principles which have been indicated.</P>

<SALUTE>Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>From the delays, and danger of e&s;capes, which attend in the pre&s;ent &s;ituation of judiciary inve&s;tigations, to e&s;tabli&s;h preliminary proce&s;&s;es a|gain&s;t offenders, it is deemed advi&s;eable, to proceed in a more &s;ummary way, in the mo&s;t di&s;affected &s;cenes, again&s;t tho&s;e who have notoriou&s;ly com|mitted trea&s;onable acts; that is, to employ the military, for the purpo&s;e of apprehending, and bringing &s;uch per&s;ons before the judge of the di&s;trict, to be by him examined, and dealt with according to law.</P>
<P>To you is committed the execution of this object, within that part of Allegheny county to which you are advancing.</P>
<P>As a guide to you, you have herewith a li&s;t of per&s;ons (No. 1.) who, hav|ing complied with the terms offered by the commi&s;&s;ioners of the United States, are entitled to an exemption from arre&s;t and puni&s;hment; and who are, therefore, not to be meddled with. You have al&s;o a li&s;t (No. 2.) who it is under&s;tood, on good grounds, have committed acts of trea&s;on; and who may, therefore, be &s;afely apprehended.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e, you may, in the cour&s;e of your operations, receive &s;atis|factory information of others who have committed like acts, and whom, in that ca&s;e, you will al&s;o cau&s;e to be apprehended. The acts alluded to, are the following: 1&s;t. The firing upon, impri&s;oning, or interrupting, in the cour&s;e of his duty, the mar&s;hal of the di&s;trict. 2d. The two attacks on the hou&s;e of John Neville, e&s;q. in&s;pector of the revenue. 3d. The a&s;&s;embling, or aiding the a&s;&s;emblage, of an army at Braddock's field, in the county of Allegheny, on the fir&s;t day of Augu&s;t la&s;t. 4th. The a&s;&s;embling, and acting as delegates, at the meeting at Parkin&s;on's ferry, which began the 14th day of the &s;ame month. 5th.

Cooper, and George Robin&s;on. Of the&s;e, all had &s;igned the amne&s;ty, except George Robin&s;on, and Mordecai M'Don|ald. And with regard to George Robin&s;on, I never heard a &s;ingle &s;yllable alledged; but, on the contrary, he was known to be a mo&s;t worthy peaceable man; the chief burge&s;s of Pitt&s;|burgh. His not &s;igning the paper of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, was owing to a mi&s;take of pride, which had exi&s;ted with many, that it would be a virtual acknowledgement of having done &s;omething in vio|lation of the laws. Neverthele&s;s, the&s;e were arre&s;ted, in the night of the 13th of November, all except Andrew M'Nickle and William Amber&s;on; the la&s;t of whom had received &s;ome hint of it, and &s;urrendered him&s;elf to the judiciary, then &s;itting in his hou&s;e. Alexander M'Nickle found favour, and by &s;ome direction to general Irwin, was pa&s;&s;ed over. Martin Cooper, al&s;o, was pa&s;&s;ed over; and he never knew that he had been up|on the li&s;t, until I informed him, the other day, when the&s;e papers came into my hands. Nothing could be a greater proof to me, of favouriti&s;m and prejudice&punc; than the forming this li&s;t, and the management re&s;pecting to it. Jeremiah Sturgeon had been arre&s;ted, as the per&s;on intended under the name of Alex|der Sturgeon. I will now a&s;&s;ume four of the&s;e; Andrew Wat|&s;on, William H. Beaumont, Jeremiah Sturgeon, and George Robin&s;on; than whom, I will pledge my&s;elf, there are not four le&s;s &s;upected, much le&s;s offending men, in the whole town of Pitt&s;burgh. With regard to the others, there had been allega|tions in regard of rai&s;ing a liberty-pole; but, as to the greater part of them, found afterwards to be groundle&s;s.</P>
<P>Andrew Wat&s;on was my neighbour, one of the mo&s;t worthy men on earth, and a per&s;on who had &s;uffered as much unea&s;i|ne&s;s, from the di&s;turbance, as any man could do; had demean|ed him&s;elf in the mo&s;t unexceptionable manner. Jeremiah Sturgeon, one of the mo&s;t unoffending of men; and of George Robin&s;on I have already &s;poken. The&s;e men were little known out of the town of Pitt&s;burgh; and it mu&s;t have been from thence, that any information again&s;t them, could have come.</P>
<P>The&s;e men were dragged out of their beds, at two o'clock in the morning: not &s;uffered to dre&s;s them&s;elves, but in an unfin|i&s;hed manner; obliged to march, &s;ome of them, without put|ting on their &s;hoes, which they had to carry with them in their hands; dragged out of their beds, amid&s;t the cries of children, and the tears of mothers; treated with language of the mo&s;t in&s;ulting opprobrium, by tho&s;e apprehending them; driven be|fore a troop of hor&s;e, at a trot, through muddy roads, &s;even

miles from Pitt&s;burgh; impounded in a pen, on the wet &s;oil. The guard baying them, and a&s;king them how they would like to be hanged; &s;ome offering a dollar to have the privilege of &s;hooting at them; carried thence four miles towards the town; obliged to lie, all night upon the wet earth, without covering; under a &s;ea&s;on of &s;leet, rain, and &s;now; driven from the fire with bayonets, when &s;ome of them peri&s;hing had crawled, en|deavouring to be un&s;een, towards it; next day empounded in a wa&s;te hou&s;e, and detained there five days; then removed to a newly built and damp room, without fire, in the garri&s;on at Pitt&s;burgh; at the end of ten days brought before the judiciary, and the information again&s;t them found not to be regarded.&mdash; Was this the way to quell an in&s;urrection? Was this the way to make good citizens? Do I blame the judiciary? No. I blame the management of tho&s;e concerned to injure them. The&s;e were neighbours and friends of mine, and that is the &s;ecret of their &s;ufferings. It was thought by my adver&s;aries that they might have a knowledge of &s;omething again&s;t me, and that, when alarmed for them&s;elves, they would di&s;clo&s;e it. At lea&s;t I can in no other way, account for the repre&s;entation which had been made with regard to them, as &s;u&s;picious per&s;ons. They were examined, but all they could &s;ay, was in my favour.</P>
<P>William H. Beaumont, from the cold, was affected in his eyes, and incapable of doing any thing for the remainder of the winter, and yet labours under a weakne&s;s in that organ. George Robin&s;on was affected with a cold, unfit for attending his bu&s;i|ne&s;s, which was that of a mechanic, for a long period. Why do I mark the&s;e things &s;o minutely? It is to induce Mr. attorney Rawle, or judge Peters, if they ever read this, to enable me to trace the &s;ource of information again&s;t the&s;e, that in a free country, I may bring the calumniators to ju&s;tice. I feel my&s;elf concerned, not only per&s;onally, but for the honour of the gov|ernment.</P>
<P>In the cour&s;e of the day or two following, intelligence from the &s;eat of examination, to me by citizens who were occa&s;ional|ly from thence, purported that the te&s;timony was becoming ve|ry &s;trong, and that recruits of witne&s;&s;es again&s;t me had gone on. It began to be under&s;tood that a &s;econd arre&s;t was to take place, and that general Wilkins, James Clow, town clerk of Pitt&s;burgh, a certain Fergus Fergu&s;on, a collier, and my&s;elf were to be upon the li&s;t. Is it po&s;&s;ible, thought I, that mal|ice can impeach general Wilkins, who, during the in&s;urrection, was him&s;elf &s;o obnoxious, for his attachment to the government,
<PB N="72" REF="028332_0189_0FD89994B9FCECC8">
and who exerted every means in his power, that were prudent and proper, to check the in&s;urrection? As to Clow, his offence could be nothing more than &s;igning the pa&s;&s;port of Neville, which was to &s;erve him. Fergus Fergu&s;on had no concern in the di&s;turbance that I ever heard of; but he had neglected to appear on the 11th of September, and to &s;ign the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion paper. He was alarmed, not knowing but that all were to be hanged, that were found out of it. He had con&s;ulted me at an early period. I was of opinion, that as his employment and re|&s;idence was &s;ubterraneous, he could plead the not belonging to the &s;urface of the earth; or if in &s;trickne&s;s, this would not bar the juri&s;diction of the court; it would at lea&s;t have weight with the executive, to direct the attorney general to enter a <HI>noli pro&s;equi,</HI> in as much as he had been under ground through the &s;ummer, and had not heard of the in&s;urrection, until it was over.</P>
<P>Charles Smith, &s;on-in-law to commi&s;&s;ioner Yates, one of the a&s;&s;i&s;tant examiners with the judges, had come to town, and mentioned it to a per&s;on, who communicated to me, that my arre&s;tation was certain; that he was a&s;toni&s;hed that I was &s;till in Pitt&s;burgh.&mdash;"Had I no regard for my life?" That others al&s;o, who had no apprehen&s;ion of it, were in the like predica|ment; that 36 hours would make a great change in Pitt&s;burgh. Thought I, my adver&s;aries have been more &s;ucce&s;sful, in mar|&s;halling the pre&s;umption of guilt in my ca&s;e, than I had con|ceived. I take it for granted, that I &s;hall be arre&s;ted, beyond all que&s;tion, now. However, I had compo&s;ed my mind a good deal by this time, and thought I could have fortitude to bear all they could accompli&s;h; and if there was any chance of ju&s;|tice at all, I would finally triumph over them.</P>
<P>Hearing that I had been con&s;idered as a leader of the in&s;ur|gents, I thought I mu&s;t endeavour to &s;upport the appearance, as I would be a good deal looked at. And I had, ju&s;t before this time, got a large cocked hat, and buff under dre&s;s, with a coat of military blue; and now and then occa&s;ionally &s;hewed my&s;elf in the &s;treet, imitating, as well as I could, the grave deportment, and &s;tately gait of a general officer. A variety of detachments of hor&s;e had come to town, and I found it was a matter of curio&s;ity, to &s;ee the leader of the in&s;urgents. I would &s;ometimes hear it &s;aid, when not &s;uppo&s;ed to hear it, "He has the appearance of a military man."</P>
<P>In order to account for this, it was &s;aid by &s;ome, who pre|tended
<PB N="73" REF="028332_0190_0FD8999675E39BC8">
to know my hi&s;tory, that I had been an officer in the late war.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding it was known that I remained in Pitt&s;burgh, yet it might be &s;uppo&s;ed, that as the danger approached, I might become more alarmed, and ab&s;cond, if direction was given to take me in the day; and for that rea&s;on, and becau&s;e it would gratify my adver&s;aries, to accumulate humiliation upon me, I counted upon being arre&s;ted in the night. I therefore lay all night upon a couch, without undre&s;&s;ing, ready, at a moment, to obey the mandate, and go with the guard that &s;hould call for me. I lay two nights in this manner, not &s;leeping much, but con&s;oling my&s;elf with reading &s;ome of the lives of Plutarch. Reading that of Solon, I meditated upon his laws, making it death for a citizen, in a civil tumult, not to take a part; for by taking a part, on one &s;ide or the other, the moderate citi|zens will be divided, and mixing with the violent, will correct the fury, on both &s;ides, until an accommodation can be brought about. It was on that principle I had acted in the in&s;urrection; and by &s;eeming to be of the in&s;urgents, had contributed to &s;oft|en all their mea&s;ures, and finally prevent a civil war. But I &s;aw that the law of Solon would apply chiefly to a &s;mall re|public, where the moderate men were known to each other, and could explain them&s;elves in the cour&s;e of the gociation. I had been treading upon a precipice; making an experiment ex|tremely dangerous. My intentions were laudable, but my con|duct hazardous. It is true, I had been called upon, in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, by a public officer; and through the whole of the &s;cene, was in confidence with men, that I had conceived would be un&s;u&s;pected. But I was at a great di&s;tance from the &s;eat of government, and not in confidence with the fir&s;t officers, and it might be &s;aid, that I had deceived others. If the like &s;cene &s;hould happen again, I will not conduct my&s;elf on the principle of Solon's law. Let people that are to be expelled, get out of the country the be&s;t way they can, and let the executive and in&s;urgents &s;ettle their own negociations; I will have nothing to do with them.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the judiciary had come to Pitt&s;burgh; and the commander in chief al&s;o. The deputy quarter ma&s;ter had taken my hou&s;e for head quarters; not, I believe, becau&s;e it was my hou&s;e, but becau&s;e it was a large one. I was plea&s;ed, in one re&s;pect, to &s;ee written upon my door, "The command|er in chief's quarters," as it would &s;ecure from a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There were &s;till threats to this effect.</NOTE>.
<PB N="74" REF="028332_0191_0FD89997AFC01730">
But, on the other hand, it would increa&s;e the ignominy, to be dragged hence under a guard.</P>
<P>I had reduced my&s;elf, with my family, to one apartment of my hou&s;e, where I meant to remain, and not &s;ee the general; but unexpectedly was informed, that &s;ome of the military had entered the outer door, and were a&s;king for me. Having no|thing but the arre&s;t in my mind, I compo&s;ed my&s;elf a moment, and &s;tepped out to &s;urrender my&s;elf; thinking of &s;ome words to addre&s;s the officer of the guard, in order to conciliate, as far as was practicable, civility of treatment. I was appalled, at the addre&s;s of general Lee, who, with his &s;uite, had ju&s;t en|tered. I had known him, when a lad, at the academy, twenty years ago; and I had often, as being a &s;enior &s;cholar, a&s;&s;i&s;ted him in his prelections, or in the &s;tudy of the principles of com|po&s;ition, and eloquence; and had never expected to &s;ee him the general of an army, arre&s;ting me for an attempt to overthrow a government.</P>
<P>The general di&s;covered a pau&s;e in me to receive his advance, and to an&s;wer; and a&s;ked, if he was mi&s;taken, in &s;uppo&s;ing that his quarters were to be at my hou&s;e? I gave him to under|&s;tand, that there was no mi&s;take; and having &s;hewed him into an apartment, withdrew. I confined my&s;elf to my apartment. The day after&punc; general Lee &s;ent a me&s;&s;age to me, &s;ignifying his expectation, that, as my hou&s;e was taken up by his family, I would dine with him. It was extremely painful to me, but I could not make an apology, without explaining the delicacy of my &s;ituation; and it had been my &s;y&s;tem, to be prepared for an arre&s;t, but not to di&s;cover that I expected it. I endeavoured to decline the invitation, upon common place grounds, but he in&s;i&s;ted, and I dined with him.</P>
<P>At dinner. I &s;at next a general Chambers, whom I had ne|ver &s;een in my life before, yet I hated him. I had heard, that the day of the arre&s;t of the inhabitants from Pitt&s;burgh, when the guard was removing them from the fir&s;t ground to a &s;e|cond, at &s;ome di&s;tance, the captain of the guard, Colhoun, of Chamber<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">urgh, had lent his hor&s;e to my neighbour, Andrew Wat&s;on, who had fallen &s;ick, and was unable to walk; when general Chambers coming up, ordered him to di&s;mount, with opprobrious appellations. I conceived, from this incident, that the general had di&s;cipline, but not humanity. Perhaps, at the time, I did not make a &s;ufficient allowance, for that indignation which he felt, on &s;eeing one, whom he mu&s;t think a great cul|prit, treated with indulgence. As &s;oon as I could, to &s;ave ap|pearances,
<PB N="75" REF="028332_0192_0FD8999D9B7FE2F0">
I withdrew from the table. My mind was extreme|ly hurt; for though every per&s;on behaved with politene&s;s to me, yet I conceived them to think me an in&s;urgent; and I felt, every moment, the ab&s;urdity of dining in &s;uch company this hour, and the next to be conducted, with ignominy, as a cri|minal.</P>
<P>Early next morning, a &s;ubpoena was read to me, from judge Peters, commanding me before him, at his chamber, to give te&s;timony, touching all &s;uch matters as &s;hould be enquired of me. I con&s;idered this as, in fact, an examination touching my|&s;elf; and that, on the opinion formed from this, was to depend my being or not being arre&s;ted.</P>
<P>I attended the judge, and was referred by him to &s;ecretary Hamilton, for examination. I was received by Hamilton, with that countenance, which a man will have, when he &s;ees a per|&s;on, with regard to whom his humanity and his &s;en&s;e of ju&s;tice &s;truggles;&mdash;he would have him &s;aved, but is afraid he mu&s;t be hanged;&mdash;was willing to treat me with civility, but was em|barra&s;&s;ed with a &s;en&s;e, that, in a &s;hort time, I mu&s;t probably &s;tand in the predicament of a culprit, and be in irons. He be|gan, by a&s;king me &s;ome general que&s;tions, with regard to any &s;y&s;tem or plan, within my knowledge, of overthrowing the gov|ernment. I had known of nothing of the kind. After a num|ber of general que&s;tions, to which I had to an&s;wer in the ne|gative, I propo&s;ed putting an end to that, by giving him a nar|rative of every thing I did know. It was agreed; and he be|gan to write. I gave him the outlines of the narrative I have given in this publication, until I came to that particular, where, after the burning Neville's hou&s;e, I repre&s;ented the people calling upon Bradford and Mar&s;hall to come forward, and &s;up|port what was done, under the pain of being treated&punc; as Ne|ville him&s;elf had been. At this the &s;ecretary laid down his pen, and addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to me; Mr. Brackenridge, &s;aid he, I ob|&s;erve one leading trait in your account, a di&s;po&s;ition to excu&s;e the principal actors; and before we go further, I mu&s;t be can|did, and inform you of the delicate &s;ituation in which you &s;tand; <HI>you are not within the amne&s;ty; you have not &s;igned upon the day;</HI> a thing we did not know until we came upon this ground, I mean into the we&s;tern country; and though the government may not be di&s;po&s;ed to proceed rigorou&s;ly, yet it has you in its power; and it will depend upon the candour of your account, what your fate will be. My an&s;wer was, <HI>I am not within the amne&s;ty,</HI> and am &s;en&s;ible of the extent of the power of the gov|ernment;
<PB N="76" REF="028332_0193_0FD8999E8F9C3F10">
but were the narrative to begin again, I would not change a &s;ingle word. I went on. Having pa&s;&s;ed through the circum&s;tances of the mar&s;hal and Neville being privy to my giv|ing my opinion to Black and Hamilton, on the effect of the writs of &s;ubpoena again&s;t delinquent di&s;tillers, and Neville reque&s;ting me to go to the Mingo meeting-hou&s;e, my examination was ad|journed; Mr. Hamilton being called upon to dinner; and I was de&s;ired to attend in the afternoon.</P>
<P>I came home; but declined dining with general Lee that day, though pre&s;&s;ed by &s;everal me&s;&s;ages&punc; I could not bear to &s;hew my&s;elf with that company, in the doubtful predicament in which I &s;tood.</P>
<P>At three o'clock I returned to my examination; Mr. Hamil|ton entering the room where I waited for him, appeared to have been reflecting, and &s;aid, "Mr. Brackenridge your conduct has been horribly mi&s;repre&s;ented." I &s;aw that he never before heard the lea&s;t of my being &s;olicited by Neville the younger, to go to the meeting at Mingo creek, but having ju&s;t dined in company with Neville, at the hou&s;e of major Craig, where I was then examined, he had a&s;ked Neville, and he had acknow|ledged it. This is conjecture.</P>
<P>I went on to give an account of the Mingo creek meeting. The &s;ecretary appeared not &s;atisfied. "Mr. Brackenridge," &s;aid he, "you mu&s;t know we have te&s;timony extremely unfa|vourable to you, of &s;peeches made at this meeting; in particu|lar your ridiculing of the executive." I &s;aw that &s;ome fools had mi&s;under&s;tood, and had been giving account of what I had deduced from the lenity of the Pre&s;ident, in the ca&s;e of the Pre&s;qu'i&s;le e&s;tabli&s;hment, and my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">roducing general Knox and the Seneca Indian, Obeal, or Cornplanter, making &s;peeches. I was extremely hurt to think, that, after I had been called upon, in the manner I was to go forward on that occa&s;ion, I &s;hould be at the mercy of the accounts of per&s;ons who did not under&s;tand me, and obliged to an&s;wer the plea&s;antry I had found nece&s;&s;ary to u&s;e, to carry off their minds, for a time, from the object they were upon, until I &s;aw them better di&s;|po&s;ed to hear what I had farther to &s;ay. My an&s;wer was, "Five per&s;ons were cho&s;en to go with me to that meeting; for the expre&s;s purpo&s;e of bearing te&s;timony of what I &s;hould &s;ay; let the&s;e be called upon. Is it rea&s;onable I &s;hould be at the mercy of the mi&s;conceptions, or a voluntary mi&s;repre&s;entation of weak or prejudiced individuals?" He was &s;ilent. I went on giving an account of the town meeting of Pitt&s;burgh. I &s;tated
<PB N="77" REF="028332_0194_0FD899A00AAD8928">
it, as moved by me, that we &s;hould march and affect to join the people at Braddock's fields. I &s;aw the &s;ecretary pau&s;e at this, and &s;ink into a deep reflection. It &s;taggered him. Was it any more, &s;aid I, than what Richard the &s;econd did, when a mob of 100,000 men a&s;&s;embled on Blackheath? the young prince ad|dre&s;&s;ed them, put him&s;elf at their head, and &s;aid, What do want, gentleman? I will lead you on.</P>
<P>My narrative now continued. After &s;ome time the &s;ecretary ob&s;erved, "My brea&s;t begins to ach, we will &s;top to night; we will re&s;ume it to-morrow morning at 9 o'clock." I with|drew, but was &s;truck with his la&s;t expre&s;&s;ion. I was at a lo&s;s to know whether his brea&s;t ached for my &s;ake, or from the writing; but di&s;po&s;ed to con&s;true every thing unfavourable, I &s;uppo&s;ed it was for my &s;ake, and that he &s;aw I mu&s;t be arre&s;t|ed.</P>
<P>Next morning general Lee made an apology to Mrs. Brack|enridge, that for the &s;ake of retirement, and to be in a le&s;s central part of the town, he was about to withdraw to other quarters, with &s;ome part of his family. I con&s;idered this as owing to the delicacy of his feelings, that he wi&s;hed to be out of the way, and not a witne&s;s of the circum&s;tance of one with whom he had been acquainted in juvenile years, &s;inking into a melancholy &s;ituation ju&s;t under his eye. I had taken it for granted that he had received a hint from Mr. Hamilton, of what was to take place.</P>
<P>Waiting on the &s;ecretary, at 9 o'clock, my examination re|commenced. In the cour&s;e of the narrative, his countenance began to brighten, and having fini&s;hed the hi&s;tory, there was an end. "Mr. Brackenridge," &s;aid he, "in the cour&s;e of ye&s;terday I had unea&s;y feelings, I was concerned for you as for a man of talents; my impre&s;&s;ions were unfavourable; you may have ob&s;erved it. I now think it my duty to inform you, that not a &s;ingle one remains. Had we li&s;tened to &s;ome people, I do not know what we might have done. There is a &s;ide to your account; your conduct has been horribly mi&s;repre&s;ented, owing to mi&s;conception. I will announce you in this point of view to governor Lee, who repre&s;ents the executive. You are in no per&s;onal danger. You will not be troubled even by a &s;imple inqui&s;ition by the judge; what may be due to your&s;elf with the public, is another que&s;tion."</P>
<P>In &s;o delicate a ca&s;e, where life had been &s;ought by in&s;idious men; and where, what I felt with more &s;en&s;ibility, my hopes of e&s;timation in the world, were likely to be bla&s;ted, at lea&s;t for a

time, it may ea&s;ily be &s;uppo&s;ed, that no word e&s;caped me, or will ever be forgotten.</P>
<P>My &s;en&s;ibility had been greatly wounded, when I waited on judge Peters with the narrative to &s;ign it, as directed by Mr. Hamilton. It was with difficulty, I could write my name. I cur&s;ed the circum&s;tance of having to write it five times, to the five different &s;heets of paper, of which my narrative con&s;i&s;ted. I returned to my hou&s;e with different feelings from tho&s;e I had for a long time before.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XI.</HEAD>
<P>IN collecting te&s;timony again&s;t me, there was no pains &s;par|ed. It had been the con&s;tant &s;tudy and employment of my bro|ther of the bar, for a long time before; with denunciations that he would have me hanged. In the examination of witne&s;&s;es, when brought forward, there was no boot, or other in&s;trument of torture, in the hands of the examiners; but there was cer|tainly every addre&s;s to the fears of individuals, to extort from them, an acknowledgment of &s;omething &s;aid or done by me. I am unwilling to mark any thing as contrary to my ideas of propriety, but declaring, that in all I have &s;een or heard I have nothing el&s;e to mark, I take the liberty of &s;tating as what was con&s;idered by me as improper, viz. the &s;ugge&s;ting to witne&s;&s;es, in the cour&s;e of examination, that the enjoyment of the am|ne&s;ty, which they claimed, would depend upon the candour with which they gave te&s;timony again&s;t others; it will be recol|lected that it was &s;ugge&s;ted to me, by the &s;ecretary, what a|mounted to the &s;ame thing; that, though not under the am|ne&s;ty in &s;trictne&s;s, yet candour in my own ca&s;e, and that of o|thers, would determine the executive in giving a rigid or libe|ral con&s;truction to my &s;igning after the day. I felt the ob&s;er|vation with infinite &s;en&s;i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ility. It was humiliating enough to have it thought, for a moment, that I had any occa&s;ion for an amne&s;ty; or that if I had, I would purcha&s;e it, by giving te&s;ti|mony again&s;t others, more liberally, than if &s;afe. I &s;aw that in the mind of the &s;ecretary, ju&s;tice was not done to me. He knew not my pride, and the path of honour which I have pur|&s;ued through life. But I acknowledge, in defence of &s;uch &s;pe|cies
<PB N="79" REF="028332_0196_0FD899A300610FA8">
of torture, for I give it that name, that the judiciary mu&s;t have di&s;covered a reluctance in witne&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e to give te&s;timony; no doubt of it; but better no te&s;timony than fal&s;e; and who could tell but that a timid wretch, under fear of being hanged, even though he had no te&s;timony, would endeavour to make &s;ome, in order to e&s;cape the &s;u&s;picion of keeping back what he had. It is the general impre&s;&s;ion of the country, and I aver it to be my own, that wrong has been done by per&s;ons depo&s;ing, under fear, again&s;t their neighbours more than was true. At the &s;ame time, there is no manner of que&s;tion, but that much more fre|quently matters have been &s;oftened in the relation; but there is no defalcation or &s;etting off in this ca&s;e; for it is better that ten guilty per&s;ons e&s;cape, then one innocent per&s;on &s;uffer.</P>
<P>The judiciary were aware, but not &s;ufficiently, of the dili|gence of malice in &s;ome per&s;ons again&s;t others, taking advantage of the occa&s;ion, to exerci&s;e revenge. There was ju&s;t as much danger of this now, on the one &s;ide, as there had been in Tom the Tinker's time, on the other. I have heard of a great deal of it. Why do I remark the&s;e things? of what u&s;e? I mean it as a memento, &s;hould a like occa&s;ion ari&s;e. I mean to &s;trength|en that caution, with which te&s;timony is to be received in all &s;uch ca&s;es; and which, I acknowledge, has been exerci&s;ed by the judiciary on the late occa&s;ion, in general, as far as, con&s;i|dering all circum&s;tances, could rea&s;onably be expected.</P>
<P>I do not mean to que&s;tion the nece&s;&s;ity, for nothing el&s;e could ju&s;tify it, of making the arre&s;t in the night, and by &s;qua|drons of hor&s;e; but I only take notice, that, this being nece&s;|&s;ary, it was the greater hard&s;hip for a man to be arre&s;ted, who was a good citizen; for in&s;tead of being treated, as far as con|&s;i&s;tent with confinement, with all the delicacy that a &s;till exi&s;t|ing pre&s;umption of innocence demands, and which the mild ha|bits of an arre&s;t, by a common civil officer, gives, he is &s;ubject|ed to the in&s;ults, which may naturally be expected from tho&s;e who, having ju&s;t before thought of fighting and killing, are di&s;po&s;ed now to have, at lea&s;t the &s;atisfaction of cur&s;ing, or &s;tarving, or otherwi&s;e abu&s;ing the people.</P>
<P>The 13th of November was a dreadful night through the we&s;tern country. Hundreds were arre&s;ted; offenders and wit|ne&s;&s;es &s;ometimes together. Though the directions were to di&s;|tingui&s;h in the treatment, yet it could not always be done, in the fir&s;t in&s;tance. There was danger of witne&s;&s;es ab&s;conding, as well as of tho&s;e again&s;t whom te&s;timony was to be given. The &s;cene was di&s;agreeable. Men thrown into jail, kept in
<PB N="80" REF="028332_0197_0FD899A475A39140">
cold barns, or out-hou&s;es, or tied back to back in cellars. The officers charged with their cu&s;tody, in &s;ome ca&s;es, behaved with mildne&s;s; in others, with wanton and unnece&s;&s;ary &s;everity. Captain Dunlap, of Philadelphia, is &s;aid to have conducted a number of pri&s;oners from Wa&s;hington to Pitt&s;burgh, with hu|manity. A captain &mdash; is &s;aid, on the other hand, to have driven a number, under his cu&s;tody, like cattle before him, at a trot, in muddy roads, through a water, the Chartiers, to the middle; and then impounded them in a wet &s;table, and in&s;ulted them, by ordering to be thrown into the manger, dough and raw fle&s;h to eat. Pa&s;&s;ing to Wa&s;hington, &s;ometime afterwards, I examined the &s;tables, and collected the&s;e circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>The judiciary were employed a con&s;iderable length of time, in examining the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;e of individual pri&s;oners, as they were brought before them. L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;s <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ttrociou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> offenders, or at lea&s;t tho&s;e thought to be &s;uch, were remitted to the pre&s;ident of the &s;tate di&s;trict, to be recognized to appear at the courts of quarter &s;e&s;|&s;ion of their re&s;pective counties, to an&s;wer for the mi&s;demean|or. A cla&s;s, &s;till le&s;s proper objects of puni&s;hment, either from alleviating circum&s;tances in their ca&s;e, or from indigence or help|le&s;&s;ne&s;s of family, were &s;ent to governor Lee, to be admoni&s;h|ed by him, agreeably to in&s;tructions, and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed. The ju|diciary was humane; and pardonable frauds were practi&s;ed upon it. It was no uncommon thing for girls, with pads, to &s;ave their lovers, by pa&s;&s;ing for married and pregnant women, with two or three children at home, calling for bread. Judge Pe|ters could not be &s;uppo&s;ed to be a midwife, nor could the writ <HI>de ventre in&s;piciendo</HI> i&s;&s;ue, but from the court. It was there|fore nece&s;&s;ary to admit the fact.</P>
<P>Whether from a natural cunning, finding out what could ex|cu&s;e or recommend, or taught by my adver&s;aries, a proper u&s;e was al&s;o made, e&s;pecially when remitted to the governor, of the prejudice that was &s;uppo&s;ed to exi&s;t again&s;t me. "It was Brackenridge that brought them into all their trouble." Some|times they would add Bradford.</P>
<P>A part of governor Lee's family had remained &s;till in my hou&s;e, and I came to under&s;tand the ground of his removal; it was owing to objections made to come to his table, or to the hou&s;e on my account. I had &s;ore&s;een this, and had it in my mind. The od<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">um of the army was, of it&s;elf, &s;ufficient to pro|duce this. But my adver&s;aries were not wanting to a&s;&s;i&s;t, if any thing was def<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ent. Governor Lee ju&s;tified his civility to me, and told the remon&s;trants, that he was to pre&s;ume me an

hone&s;t man, until I was declared other wi&s;e, by tho&s;e whom he had a right to know; that when pre&s;ented to his authority in the light of a criminal, to be treated as &s;uch, he would know what to do. This was during my examination by &s;ecretary Hamilton. However, the clamour was &s;o general, and great, that he found him&s;elf under the nece&s;&s;ity of yielding, in the manner I have &s;tated.</P>
<P>My adver&s;aries were extremely enraged, at the di&s;appoint|ment of not having me arre&s;ted. I was diverted with an ex|pre&s;&s;ion of old general Neville&mdash;"The mo&s;t artful fellow that ever was on God Almighty's earth; he has deceived Ro&s;s, he has put his finger in Bradford's eye, in Yates' eye <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The attorney general and commi&s;&s;ioner Yates. It would &s;eem that their gentlemen &s;poke <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">avourably of me, on their return from the country.</NOTE>, and now he has put his finger in Hamilton's eye too: I would not won|der if he is made attorney for the &s;tates, on the we&s;t of the Allegheny mountain."</P>
<P>My brother of the bar expo&s;tulated very warmly with the judiciary, for the a&s;toni&s;hing defect of official duty, in not &s;end|ing me in irons to the capital. It is to be pre&s;umed, they made proper apologies for acting agreeably to their own judgment, and contrary to his.</P>
<P>Neville the younger had conducted him&s;elf with more deli|cate, but with more dangerous addre&s;s. I had been more ap|prehen&s;ive of the effect of his influence, than that of the attor|ney. Having failed of a public pro&s;ecution, his object has been to e&s;tabli&s;h individual re&s;entment. I have heard of the infor|mation he has given, with a view to make me enemies. When I am called upon, I will an&s;wer, as to the correctne&s;s of the in|formation given.</P>
<P>Talk of a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inating me had con&s;iderably &s;ub&s;ided, in the mean time. A feint had been made one day, as I &s;tood in the door. An officer pre&s;ented a pi&s;tol, within a few &s;teps. It was to intimidate; for on my not moving, but looking at him &s;tea|dily, he dropped it. He was a whim&s;ical fellow; for return|ing to the public hou&s;e, he took part again&s;t another officer, who was abu&s;ing me; and &s;aid, I mu&s;t be an hone&s;t man, for I &s;tood firm when he pre&s;ented his pi&s;tol. It came to a conte&s;t between them, and my champion di&s;armed his adver&s;ary.</P>
<P>Governor Howell having been, by this time, a little better informed in my ca&s;e, had the politene&s;s to call upon me, and
<PB N="82" REF="028332_0199_0FD897F8F5476F50">

I affected to acknowledge it to be an error of judgment in me: but I thought it an error of prejudice in him. However, I was greatly plea&s;ed with the &s;oldier-like appearance, the frankne&s;s of manners, and the eloquence of the governor; and was very &s;orry that, though my &s;tanding was better than it had been, yet, even then, I could not feel my&s;elf ea&s;y in vi|&s;iting his troops, among&s;t whom I had many academic acquaint|ances, having been educated at the college of that &s;tate.</P>
<P>Arrangements had been made for the return of the army, and the divi&s;ions had moved. Governor Lee give a dinner to the gentlemen of the village. I had no invitation. He was led to &s;uppo&s;e, that it would give offence to the greate&s;t part. I &s;miled, to think how my adver&s;aries were reducing them&s;elves, and rai&s;ing me.</P>
<P>I had an invitation to dine with the governor next day, with his family alone. If this was not a greater compliment, it was certainly a greater plea&s;ure to me, than to have had an invi|tation with the croud. He did me the honour to reque&s;t a con|ference, in private, the morning following, on the affairs of the country. It was a proof to me, that though he had given my adver&s;aries the compliment of ceremony, he gave me that of confidence.</P>
<P>A dinner was now to be given to the governor, on the part of the citizens. A number of gentlemen, who had called up|on me, and expre&s;&s;ed their indignation at the treatment I had received, &s;olicited me to join in the &s;ub&s;cription to the enter|tainment to be given to the governor. I declined it, on the grou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d of not having been at the public dinner on the part of the governor.</P>
<P>A ball was now to be given, on the evening of the enter|tainment. Protho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">otary Bri&s;on had been always thought qua|lified for, or at lea&s;t a&s;&s;umed the place of, a ma&s;ter of ceremo|nies on the&s;e occa&s;ions. He was made a manager; and whe|ther it was becau&s;e I had called him a coxcomb, or my adver|&s;aries managing him, he declined &s;ending the u&s;ual card to Mrs. Brackenridge. She was hurt; I &s;aw the fl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;h of indignation in her cheek, and a &s;parkle of fire in her eye. I was offended for a moment. What! &s;aid I, are you hurt at this? you in&s;ult me, becau&s;e it is on my account you &s;uffer the indignity. Did you not read to me, the other evening, the life of Phocion?&mdash; after having rendered &s;ervices to the &s;tate, and accu&s;ed of trea|&s;on

by the arts of malignant individuals, and acquitted by the people; &s;uppo&s;e his adver&s;aries to have taken their revenge, by getting a ma&s;ter of ceremonies to exclude his wife from a ball; would you not think it more honourable to be the wife of Pho|cion, under the&s;e circum&s;tances, than of a common Athenian, though you had received a card, and been called upon to lead down the fir&s;t dance? would not Phocion have laughed at the indignity, as I do? and would not his wife have laughed too?

<P>Excu&s;e the compari&s;on of &s;mall things with great&punc; my&s;elf with Phocion. It was a rhetorical flouri&s;h, to &s;ave my&s;elf from being wounded by my adver&s;aries.</P>

<P>ON a review, it mu&s;t be evident, that the judicious and mild policy of the executive, in appointing commi&s;&s;ioners, was what &s;aved the country from a civil war. It gave the government a &s;trength which nothing could re&s;i&s;t. It &s;ilenced, at once, all clamour from below, and divided the people here. The rea|&s;onablene&s;s of the propo&s;itions, left the refractory without ex|cu&s;e; and brought forth the force of government with a warmth of heart, unchecked by an idea that all conciliatory means had not been tried. It may be thought &s;light; but, in my opinion, a great matter was effected. An early and effectual le&s;&s;on was given in our republican government. It would be too much, to &s;ay that a revolution was cru&s;hed in embryo; but I will &s;ay, with boldne&s;s, that what I was afraid might co&s;t an hundred thou&s;and lives, was repre&s;&s;ed without the lo&s;s of one. The phy&s;ician who, by perfect &s;kill in his art, reaches the di&s;ea&s;e, in its fir&s;t principle, by a &s;ingle grain of medicine, the patient him&s;elf &s;carcely &s;en&s;ible of it, &s;urely de&s;erves more prai&s;e, than him who, by the &s;tronge&s;t applications to the exterior of the &s;y&s;tem, makes a greater &s;hew of having done &s;omething, but has done le&s;s; or, to take a &s;imile from my own profe&s;&s;ion, a &s;ingle wi&s;e word of coun&s;el, in a cau&s;e, at the commencement, is worth an hour of the mo&s;t ma&s;terly oratory, at the manage|ment

in court. A client will &s;ometimes &s;ay, when his cau&s;e is gained, Why a&s;k &s;o much, you had no trouble? He mea&s;ures the &s;ervice, not by the effect, but by the appearance of labour his coun&s;el had in accompli&s;hing it. He counts upon the bu&s;tle of &s;peaking; whereat it has been the &s;ilence of thinking that has done the bu&s;ine&s;s. Thus it has been &s;aid, that becau&s;e there has been no horrid battle, there was nece&s;&s;ity for &s;o &s;trong an army. But it was the di&s;play of &s;o &s;trong an army, that ren|dered unnece&s;&s;ary any thing but the di&s;play of it.</P>
<P>It &s;truck me greatly, to hear it ob&s;erved, when the army was in the country and all was &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion&mdash;"What an abject cowardly &s;et the&s;e in&s;urgents are? was it worth while to make this parade for &s;uch a &s;et of poltroons? they have not given us the &s;atisfaction of the &s;lighte&s;t re&s;i&s;tance.

<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING given this detail of incidents, during the heat of the in&s;urrection; I &s;hall now revert a little, and take a view of the hi&s;tory of exci&s;e laws in the we&s;tern country, from their fir&s;t exi&s;tence, down to the cata&s;trophe that has late|ly taken place.</P>
<P>By an act of September 25th, 1756, under the then pro|vince of Penn&s;ylvania, a duty had been laid in the nature of an exci&s;e, on "all rum, brandy, or other &s;pirits &s;old, drawn, or bartered under the quantity of 70 gallons, and on all wine in like manner under one hog&s;head." This duty was for the purpo&s;e of redeeming certain bills to the amount of 30,000l. i&s;&s;ued on the credit of the province, and was to continue for the &s;pace of ten years; but by other acts, and for other purpo&s;es, was from time to time continued. An act of March 21&s;t, 1772, was for a like purpo&s;e of redeeming bills of credit, and was in force at the commencement of the revolution. By a clau&s;e of this act, "wine, rum, brandy, and other &s;pirits made or di&s;|tilled from the natural products of this province, for the private u&s;e of the owner, are excepted."</P>
<P>By an act of February 18th, 1777, under the commonwealth, the duties payable under former acts are made recoverable, and
<PB N="6" REF="028332_0203_0FD8980432C3CDC8">
the collectors continued; and where no collection exi&s;ted, it is directed that &s;uch be appointed.</P>
<P>Collectors were appointed in the we&s;tern country from time to time, but no attempt made by any of them, that I can trace, to collect the duties. It was thought to be an ignominious &s;er|vice; the name of an exci&s;e was odious. Whence the origin of this prejudice? Doubtle&s;s from the dominions of Great Britain. This country is peopled by emigrants from North Britain and Ireland. The exci&s;e duties of tho&s;e countries are ex|ten&s;ive, they embrace almo&s;t every object of con&s;umption&punc; the people are in the habit of eluding them by every means po&s;&s;ible. They hate exci&s;e officers, and con&s;ider them as men having a di&s;tinct intere&s;t from that of the community. The government it&s;elf &s;eems to con&s;ider them in &s;ome degree in that point of view, for by &s;tatutes <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">14. George III. C. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">8.</NOTE>, officers of the exci&s;e are ineli|gible as members of parliament <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">1. Black&s;tone. 176.</NOTE>, and prohibited under the pen|alty of 100l. from intermedling in elections, by per&s;uading or di&s;&s;uading any voter <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">1. Black&s;tone. 179.</NOTE>. The law guards again&s;t them as dan|gerous to liberty, not only from their numbers and influence, but from the intere&s;t which they have to increa&s;e the duties. Among&s;t the common people there is a horror of them, not on|ly on account of the drawback which they make, but on account of the power which they have to enter hou&s;es, to &s;earch, and make &s;eizures. The term gauger, is a term of reproach, and no per&s;on who can make out to live in a reputable way will ac|cept the office; the gauger and the hangman are generally coup|led in idea. The people from the&s;e countries brought the&s;e impre&s;&s;ions with them, when they came to America; and attach the &s;ame odium to exci&s;e laws and exci&s;e officers here, which they were accu&s;tomed to entertain before their emigration. Independent of the&s;e ab&s;tract prejudices, the people of the we&s;|tern country not having a market for their grain, had recour&s;e to the di&s;tillation of it; and under the acts, all beyond what was for private u&s;e, was liable to the duties. Thus it became &s;till more an object to evade the law, or oppo&s;e it.</P>
<P>The council of the &s;tate finding that from the prevailing odium in the we&s;tern country, no per&s;on could be got to accept the office, or if appointed, would not offend their neighbours by any en|quiry on the &s;ubject of the duties, commi&s;&s;ioned in the year 1783.

a certain William Graham, to be collector general on the we&s;t of the mountains. His nece&s;&s;itous circum&s;tances had induced him to accept the office. He had kept the king of Pru&s;&s;ia tav|ern in the city, but had fallen through, and was reduced to poverty. He entered upon his office in the we&s;tern country; and was treated with all po&s;&s;ible indignity. He was not con&s;id|ered as company for any per&s;on of character. He was unable to carry the law into effect, but occa&s;ionally got a little money to bear his expences, by compounding with individuals, who, rather than be troubled with him, were di&s;po&s;ed to give &s;ome|thing. With &s;ome he compounded for 40 &s;hillings per annum; with others for le&s;s. The people had occa&s;ionally amu&s;ed them|&s;elves at his expence, &s;ingeing his wig, cutting the tail of his hor&s;e, putting coals in his boots, and every other imaginable prank they could devi&s;e. In the year 1784, in the county of We&s;tmoreland, at the time of the holding a court at that place, he was be&s;ieged in a public hou&s;e a whole night, by per&s;ons who affected to be about to kill him, he had his pi&s;tols with him, and kept the door, and hindered tho&s;e within getting out. In the morning the&s;e la&s;t pretended their hor&s;es had gone off in the night, with their &s;addle-bags and money, and brought &s;uits again&s;t the collector for fal&s;e impri&s;onment and damages. He informed again&s;t tho&s;e who he conceived had been on the out&s;ide of the hou&s;e; and pro&s;ecutions were in&s;tituted, and removed into the &s;upreme court. On trial in the year 1785, he was found to have been deceived by &s;ome of tho&s;e on the out&s;ide pa&s;&s;ing them&s;elves for different per&s;ons; &s;o that having &s;worn again&s;t individuals who were per&s;onated, but were not there, the <HI>alibi</HI> was proved, and his oath di&s;credited with regard to others who really were pre&s;ent and active in the outrage.</P>
<P>In the &s;ame year, 1784, after the riot, at the &s;eat of gov|ernment in We&s;tmoreland, adverti&s;ements were publickly put up, offering a reward for his &s;calp. He was under the nece&s;&s;i|ty of abandoning We&s;tmoreland, and took refuge in the county of Wa&s;hington. In the neighbourhood of Cro&s;s creek, in that county, he was openly attacked by a mob of upwards of an hundred per&s;ons, and was &s;haved, and had his hair cut off, and was conducted and put over the Monongahela into We&s;t|moreland, with threats of death if he returned to the Wa&s;hing|ton &s;ide of the river any more. At a court of oyer and termi|ner held in the county, in the year 1785, bills of indictment having been found again&s;t 12 of the rioters, they were convict|ed and fined. Graham had been ab&s;ent from the country in the

mean time, but in order to give te&s;timony at the trials, he had attended, and it was only by coming in company with the judges, that he could think him&s;elf &s;afe. He now re&s;igned his office, and others were appointed, who made a je&s;t of doing nothing. A ju&s;tice of the peace, of the name of Craig, in Wa&s;hington county, had accepted the office, in good earne&s;t, and made attempts to do &s;omething, and became infamous.</P>
<P>I am di&s;po&s;ed to believe the duty was not collected in a &s;ingle in&s;tance, on &s;pirits di&s;tilled in the country. At Green&s;burgh, the &s;eat of ju&s;tice of We&s;tmoreland, I have heard of liquors be|ing &s;eized, that had been brought acro&s;s the mountain, the ow|ners having neglected to take out permits, agreeably to law. But in that ca&s;e one half of the liquors was forfeited to the in|former; this was the great &s;pring of attention to the law, but the&s;e &s;eizures were con&s;idered as &s;avouring of rigour, and di&s;|reputable.</P>
<P>A &s;eizure of a quantity of liquors was made in the town of Pitt&s;burgh, in the year 1790, by a collector of the name of Hunter. I appeared for the owners, before the ju&s;tices, to whom an appeal by law was given, and had the &s;eizure deter|mined to be illegal, &s;ucceeding more perhaps on the odiou&s;ne&s;s of the act it&s;elf, than of &s;trictne&s;s in law.</P>
<P>An attempt was made by collector Hunter to carry the law into operation again&s;t the di&s;tillers of Allegheny county, who had not paid the duties on the &s;pirits di&s;tilled; having adverti&s;|ed his place of re&s;idence in Pitt&s;burgh, and demanded a compli|ance with the law, he directed a number of writs to be i&s;&s;ued, to the amount of 70; the&s;e were &s;erved, but the defendents appearing and employing coun&s;el, had the writs cra&s;hed, on the ground of improper proce&s;s, a capias having i&s;&s;ued in&s;tead of a &s;ummons, whereas on a penal &s;tatute, bail is not demandable. In this there might have been &s;ome que&s;tion, as the capias might have been i&s;&s;ued with directions to accept appearance. However, the odiou&s;ne&s;s of the law gave a favourable leaning to relieve from its rigour. The popular odium again&s;t the collec|tor was &s;o great, that he left the county, and re&s;igned his office, or cea&s;ed to exerci&s;e it. Prothonotary Bri&s;on was &s;uppo&s;ed to have encouraged him in the attempt to carry the law into effect, and a degree of od<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">um exi&s;ts again&s;t him, on that account, to this day <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It will be recollected what was &s;aid with regard to him at Parkin&s;on's ferry.</NOTE>.</P>

To the&s;e re&s;olutions, carried by a majority of 36, there was a di&s;&s;ent of 11 members; not on the principle of ju&s;tifying an exci&s;e &s;y&s;tem, but on that of the impropriety of the &s;tate legi&s;lature interfering in the deliberations of the fed|eral government.

<P>The majority, in &s;upport of their re&s;olutions, entered on the journals the rea&s;ons for their votes on the que&s;tion, when the yeas and nays were called <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The&s;e rea&s;ons were the u&s;ual objections again&s;t exci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e laws.</NOTE>. A member, who had not been pre&s;ent at the fir&s;t moving of the que&s;tion, entered on the jour|nals the rea&s;ons of his di&s;&s;ent from the re&s;olutions; this was Thomas Ryer&s;on, of Wa&s;hington.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="028332_0207_0FD89809764858D8">This gentlemen having been a member of the hou&s;e with James Mar&s;hall, the preceding year, had differed from him, in a vote with regard to the continuation of a &s;tate tax; the &s;tate debt being a&s;&s;umed by the federal government, a tax was not nece&s;&s;ary as to that object. Mar&s;hall thought, that the people being in the habit of paying, would not be di&s;&s;atisfied at the con|tinuance of a light direct tax; and there were great public ob|jects to be accompli&s;hed; opening roads, clearing rivers, &amp;c. I thought Mar&s;hall right at the time, and Ryer&s;on, who differ|ed from him, wrong. But Ryer&s;on had the popular &s;ide, the keeping clear of paying of money, and he run Mar&s;hall down; &s;o that at the next election he was left out.</P>
<P>When the vote of Ryer&s;on was announced, in the ca&s;e of the re&s;olutions, Mar&s;hall, in his turn, came forward again&s;t Ryer|&s;on. He became a leader in the oppo&s;ition to the exci&s;e law. It may ea&s;ily be &s;uppo&s;ed, that Ryer&s;on was left out at the next election.</P>
<P>All the members, on their return from Philadelphia, in or|der to enhance the merit of their &s;ervices, may ea&s;ily be &s;up|po&s;ed to have been &s;trong in te&s;timony borne again&s;t the exci&s;e law of Congre&s;s, which they had &s;o &s;trenuou&s;ly, though un&s;uc|ce&s;sfully, oppo&s;ed. The re&s;olutions and the rea&s;ons were pub|li&s;hed in the Pitt&s;burgh Gazette, of March 1791, and read and commented on at all public meetings and places.</P>
<P>David Bradford, who had not, before this time, interfered in political affairs, came forward, in an open and direct man|ner, to arraign the law. Whether for the &s;ake of popularity, or from a per&s;onal pique again&s;t Thomas Scott, the &s;itting mem|ber of Congre&s;s, who had voted for the law, or again&s;t Alex|ander Addi&s;on, who, at this time, came forward, in the Pitt&s;|burgh Gazette, with a &s;trong publication in favour of it; or whether it was, that he conceived it would drain the country of circulating ca&s;h, and injure the profe&s;&s;ion of the law, or on general principle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, I declare my&s;elf at a lo&s;s to &s;ay.

<P>William Findley, of We&s;tmoreland, who had been &s;everal years in the legi&s;lature of Penn&s;ylvania, and had meditated no blow at the exci&s;e law of Penn&s;ylvania, was now of the hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives in Congre&s;s, and &s;aw great evils in that of

<P>Smiley, of Fayette, al&s;o, then a member of the hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives in Congre&s;s, and who al&s;o had been of the le|gi&s;lature of Penn&s;ylvania &s;everal years, having voted with Find|ley in the oppo&s;ition, returning to his county, added his influ|ence, to fix, if any thing was nece&s;&s;ary, the rivets of preju|dice more &s;trongly again&s;t the law.</P>
<P>But if the&s;e had all been quie&s;cent, the prejudice was, of it|&s;elf, irre&s;i&s;tible. Had they attempted to reconcile the people to the law, they would have been in&s;tantly unpopular, and have de&s;cended to the level whence they ro&s;e. It was not any thing cele&s;tial in the form or talents of the&s;e men, that made them popular; it was their &s;tanding with a party, and con&s;ulting the prejudices of the people. The moment they oppo&s;ed the feel|ings of the multitude, they were damned, with them, to a lower bed than tho&s;e whom they had never favoured. But it was not enough for them even to be &s;ilent; they were charged publicly, in the gazette, with their unpardonable inattention, while members of the legi&s;lature of Penn&s;ylvania, in having &s;uffered an exci&s;e law to exi&s;t in the government. They were under the nece&s;&s;ity of acknowledging it to have been a great o|ver&s;ight; to atone for which, they would have the &s;tate exci&s;e taken away, and would redouble their diligence in having that of the United States repealed al&s;o. The &s;tate exci&s;e law was repealed at the next &s;e&s;&s;ion of the legi&s;lature, the September following; and nothing now remained, but to have that of the United States repealed al&s;o. Findley and Smiley mu&s;t do, at lea&s;t &s;eem to be doing, &s;omething, in order to keep their &s;eats at the next election. Perhaps the men may have acted on the &s;ame principle with the people, viz. from an ab&s;olute di&s;like of it, and prejudice again&s;t it. I only &s;tate grounds of conduct, which would be &s;ufficient with me, to account for their oppo&s;i|tion, independent of the ab&s;tract principle, of any incon&s;i&s;tency in the law with equality of tax, or principles of liberty.</P>
<P>Alexander Addi&s;on, who had come forward at an early peri|od, in defending, or at lea&s;t in apologizing for the law, though po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing an independent &s;ituation, yet was &s;hortly obliged to take in his &s;ails, and &s;lacken cour&s;e.

<P>I had never con&s;idered general Neville as po&s;&s;e&s;&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ng an ex|ten&s;ive popularity, yet, at the &s;ame time, he had a re&s;pectable &s;hare of it; and what was in his favour, he &s;tood well in his own neighbourhood. But he had been a member of the legi&s;lature of Penn&s;ylvania, when the re&s;olutions again&s;t the exci&s;e law were moved and carried. He had ab&s;ented him&s;elf from the hou&s;e when the vote was taken; and this conduct was after|wards attributed, to his having previou&s;ly looked forward to an appointment under the law. The circum&s;tance of a man, whom the people have &s;ent forward in a legi&s;lative capacity, looking out for a profitable office, that he may retire, has, at all times, an appearance of &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s; and introduces the &s;u&s;picion, of having him&s;elf more in view than the public. If that man is already wealthy, and has no need of offices, as was the ca&s;e with general Neville, it increa&s;es the charge of covetou&s;ne&s;s, and accumulates the odium of his conduct. Had general Ne|ville &s;tood forward in the hou&s;e, and, on the local ground of the unequal operation of the tax to the we&s;tern country, &s;up|ported the re&s;olutions of the hou&s;e; (and I am clear, they had a right to in&s;truct their &s;enators, as immediately appointed by them); if he had, I &s;ay, acted this part, and, after the law had pa&s;&s;ed, had pointed out to the government, &s;ome firm and re|&s;pectable character, in the we&s;tern country, whom he might in|duce to accept the office, and have returned home, free from all &s;u&s;picion of intere&s;ted motives, to recommend an acquie&s;|cence to the law, and to &s;upport the officer as far as he could individually, he would have acted the part of a patriot. As the ca&s;e was, he contributed to fix the odium of the office more deeply in the minds of the people, by the circum&s;tances under which he took it.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<P>I HAD been employed as coun&s;el in defending the rioters on the indictments, at the pro&s;ecution of Graham, the &s;tate collector of exci&s;e. It is to be pre&s;umed that I had been of the &s;ame opinion with my clients, that exci&s;e laws were odious, and that an hone&s;t fellow ought not to be &s;everely treated, who had done nothing more, than to &s;have the under hairs from the head of an exci&s;e man, who wore a wig at any rate. I had appeared for the &s;eventy di&s;tillers that were &s;ued in Allegheny county, and in defending them, was led unavoidably to avail my&s;elf of arguments drawn from the odious nature of the exci&s;e laws, as a ground of &s;trict con&s;truction again&s;t their operation. I was thought by the people to be &s;taunch again&s;t all exci&s;es. I did not like much to lo&s;e my character in this re&s;pect, nor in|deed could I well afford it. I had been at the head of the prac|tice at the bar in the year 1786, when, in order to accompli&s;h a particular purpo&s;e, the obtaining a new county, comprehend|ing Pitt&s;burgh, I procured my&s;elf to be elected to the legi&s;lature of the &s;tate; the members of the &s;urrounding counties, out of which the new county mu&s;t be taken, were of cour&s;e oppo&s;ed to a di&s;memberment, and was under the nece&s;&s;ity of making friends el&s;ewhere. There were two parties at that time, in the hou&s;e, known under the name of con&s;titutional and anticon&s;titu|tional. The w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ern members were con&s;titutionali&s;ts, I was therefore obliged to join the anticon&s;titutionali&s;ts, in order to get their intere&s;t to accompli&s;h my object; of cour&s;e, when the we&s;tern members returned, I was repre&s;ented as a traitor, who had betrayed my country, becau&s;e I had gone with a wrong party. They were 9 to 1 again&s;t me; Findley was at the head of them, and I had thought to have defended my&s;elf by writing, but only made the matter wor&s;e, for the people thought it impo&s;&s;ible, that plain &s;imple men could be wrong, and a profane lawyer right.</P>
<P>Another circum&s;tance had taken place during the &s;e&s;&s;ion, which accumulated odium upon me; that was the calling a con|vention to new model the federal government. I &s;upported that mea&s;ure; and when the convention had &s;at and publi&s;hed a con|&s;titution,
<PB N="14" REF="028332_0211_0FD8980F9E8199D0">
I &s;upported the adoption of it. All my colleagu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> from the we&s;tward came home antifederali&s;ts, and held me up in a wor&s;e point of view, if po&s;&s;ible, than before. My charac|ter was totally gone with the populace. My practice was lo&s;t; and James Ro&s;s and David Bradford and others, whom I left at the bar ju&s;t beginning, got it all. Pride and good policy would not permit me to leave the country, until I had conquer|ed the prejudice&punc; I knew that to be practicable, by lying by un|til the popular f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">y &s;hould wa&s;te it&s;elf; it required time, but I had patience. But it was nece&s;&s;ary for me to be &s;ilent, and add nothing more to the popular odium. It was the fir&s;t experi|ence, I had ever had in life, of unpopularity, and I found it a thing more painful to &s;u&s;tain, and more difficult to remove, than I had thought it to be. Had I po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed an independent fortune I would have cared le&s;s about it; but I had ju&s;t laid the foundation of making &s;omething, by the practice I had e&s;ta|bli&s;hed, and this was now taken from me. It is a&s;toni&s;hing what an effect political character has upon profe&s;&s;ional &s;ucce&s;s. It was not to be expected under the&s;e circum&s;tances, let my &s;entiments have been what they might, that I would have come forward as the champion of government, in the ca&s;e of the ex|ci&s;e law. It would have been excu&s;able, had I taken &s;ome ad|vantage of the popular gale, having been &s;o long becalmed or detained by head winds, where I lay. But the fact was, that though an advocate for the federal government, I had not been an admirer of the admini&s;tration of it, I &s;peak of the legi&s;lative de|partment; the fun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing &s;y&s;tem, in all its branches, was contra|ry to my wi&s;hes, and all my ideas of ju&s;tice.

Neverthe|le&s;s, I was &s;hackled by my connections; the party to which I belonged in the legi&s;lature, and who had finally enabled us to &s;ucceed in obtaining a county, were rather on the &s;ide of the funding &s;y&s;tem, and exci&s;e law. Thomas Scott of Wa&s;hington, was a friend of mine, and he had voted for the law. Alexan|der Addi&s;on had &s;upported it in the public paper, and he was a friend of mine. I had been upon &s;uch terms with the Neville connection, that it was di&s;agreeable to me, to come forward &s;trongly in oppo&s;ition to the law, when the head of that hou&s;e was the officer for carrying the law into execution. Moreover, Findley, Smiley, and others, my political enemies, had come forward to reprobate the law. I did not like to be o&s;ten&s;ibly in the &s;ame party with them; be&s;ides in my gazette writings a|gain&s;t Findley and others, I had treated with &s;uch ridicule the arts of &s;eeking popular favour, that I was afraid of being &s;u&s;|pected of that my&s;elf. Had it not been for the&s;e circum&s;tances, I am per&s;uaded I &s;hould have come forward again&s;t the law more than I have done; and have given my adver&s;aries much greater pre&s;umption of having contributed to the in&s;urrection, than exi&s;ts, as things now are. If I had not been &s;hackled by the terms on which I was with the Neville connection particu|ularly, it is not improbable that I might have exerci&s;ed at lea&s;t attempts at wit, at the expence of the officer or the office; and exci&s;e duties might have been &s;ung here, as Wood's half pence in Ireland. And I know well that if any other had been the officer, there is no man would have enjoyed it more than gen|eral Neville. But if I had written ever &s;o much in the way of wit or invective, it would be ab&s;urd to charge me with the acts of others; for the di&s;tinction is infinite between con&s;titu|tional and uncon&s;titutional oppo&s;ition. A man has a right to arraign the policy of a law as well after it is enacted, in order to procure a repeal, as before, in order to prevent the enacting it.</P>

<P>A Meeting was held at Red&s;tone old fort, now called Brown&s;|ville, on the 27th of July, 1791; at which meeting, it was under&s;tood that Findley, Smiley, and Mar&s;hall, with a great number of the inhabitants of the we&s;tern counties, were pre|&s;ent. Albert Gallatin was clerk of the meeting. He was, at that time, a member of the legi&s;lature, and had voted with the majority, in &s;upport of the re&s;olutions to in&s;truct the &s;enators, on the exci&s;e bill in Congre&s;s. Edward Cook was chairman, who had been a decided federali&s;t; &s;o that it was not con&s;idered to be a que&s;tion of federali&s;m, or antifederali&s;m; nor had it been &s;o con&s;idered in the legi&s;lature of the &s;tate, numbers of the firm|e&s;t federali&s;ts voting with the majority, in the ca&s;e of the re&s;o|lutions with regard to the exci&s;e bill.

<P>At the meeting of the di&s;trict members, in the town of Wa&s;h|ington, on the 23d of Augu&s;t, delegates were cho&s;en to the general meeting, and certain re&s;olutions were adopted, of a violent nature, with regard to the law in que&s;tion <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Any per&s;on, who has accepted, or may accept an office under Congre&s;s, in order to carry it into effect, &s;hall be con&s;idered as inimical to the intere&s;t of the country; and it is recommended to the citizens of Wa&s;hington coun|ty, to treat every per&s;on who has accepted, or who may accept hereafter, any &s;uch office, with contempt, and ab&s;olutely to refu&s;e all kind of communica|tion or intercour&s;e with the officers, and to withhold from them all aid, &s;up|port, or comfort.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>James Mar&s;hall, who&s;e fir&s;t &s;pring in this bu&s;ine&s;s, might, in &s;ome degree, have been his conte&s;t with Ryer&s;on, but who doubtle&s;s had the &s;ame general impre&s;&s;ions with the others, had been at Pitt&s;burgh occa&s;ionally, having, at that time, a contract with the public, for the purcha&s;e of hor&s;es for the waggons of the army, had conver&s;ed with me on the &s;ubject of the exci&s;e law; and finding my &s;entiments in uni&s;on with his, not only with regard to the exci&s;e law, but the funding &s;y&s;tem in gen|eral, expre&s;&s;ed a wi&s;h that I would come forward, and get my|&s;elf elected a member from Allegheny county. I declined it, on the ground of having &s;uffered in practice, not only from the obloquy again&s;t me, but the impre&s;&s;ion the people had, that I made political &s;ubjects more the object of my attention than law. This was true; but the chief rea&s;ons why I did not come for|ward, were tho&s;e I have before a&s;&s;igned. Mar&s;hall excu&s;ed me; but thought I could have no objections to a&s;&s;i&s;t in drawing up the addre&s;&s;es propo&s;ed to the public, or to the repre&s;entatives in Congre&s;s. L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">d no objections to that.</P>
<P>James Mar&s;hall was a man for whom I had all along enter|tained re&s;pect. When I came to this country, in the year 1781, a &s;trong party exi&s;ted in favour of the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a new &s;tate, comprehending the Penn&s;ylvania and Virginia counties. Mar&s;hall was county lieutenant of Wa&s;hington, and had exert|ed him&s;elf greatly in oppo&s;ition to this mea&s;ure. I was with him, in all endeavours to compo&s;e the country, and e&s;tabli&s;h
<PB N="18" REF="028332_0215_0FD8981AB7899720">
the Penn&s;ylvania juri&s;diction. This produced an intimacy. Af|ter his lieutenancy he was &s;heriff of the county, and di&s;charged this office with general approbation, from the court, the bar, and the country. During my political debates with Findley, and others, he had leaned in my favour, to a certain extent; I had believed, from per&s;onal engagements. When a member of the convention, for the purpo&s;e of adopting the federal con&s;titution, he was the mo&s;t moderate of all the antifederali&s;ts, and refu&s;ed to &s;ign the prote&s;t, as rea&s;ons were alledged in it which did not weigh with him. I had flattered my&s;elf, with thinking that my opinion and repre&s;entations, in favour of the con&s;titution, had contributed to make him moderate; for he is naturally a demo|crat, perhaps in the extreme. At the lowe&s;t ebb of my popu|larity, he was willing to &s;erve me in my practice; and did con|tribute con&s;iderably to re&s;tore it. In the difference between him and Ryer&s;on, I could not take part, becau&s;e I was friendly to both.</P>
<P>I &s;tate the&s;e things, in order to explain the &s;tanding on which I was, at this time, with Mar&s;hall.</P>
<P>The committee met at Pitt&s;burgh, on the 7th of September. Agreeably to my engagement to Mar&s;hall, I had prepared a &s;ketch of re&s;olutions, and a draught of an addre&s;s to Congre&s;s; this la&s;t drawn with great care, and to the be&s;t of my ability. On the day, Mar&s;hall came forward, with a rough draught of an addre&s;s to the people. Bradford al&s;o had drawn &s;omething. The&s;e were put into my hand, with a reque&s;t to new model them, and give them any poli&s;h that they might &s;eem to want. I did &s;o; and my addre&s;s to Congre&s;s was copied by Mar&s;hall, and that to the people copied by Bradford. My &s;ketch of re&s;o|lutions was copied by a member of We&s;tmo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">and.</P>
<P>I was pre&s;ent, as a &s;pectator, &s;ome time during the debates in the committee, until the papers, &s;ome of which I had writ|ten, had been committed to three per&s;ons; my brother of the bar, who was then of the committee, David Bradford, and Ed|ward Cook, chairman. I heard no more of them until the day after, when, being in the printing office, I &s;aw the proceed|ings with the printer, to be publi&s;hed; and I made this ob&s;er|vation to him, "The fir&s;t draughts of &s;ome of the&s;e writings were by me, they are totally changed, rendered incon&s;i&s;tent and ab&s;urd, and I di&s;claim all re&s;pon&s;ibility." They had been new modelled in the committee. I under&s;tood my brother of the bar had alledged there were trea&s;onable expre&s;&s;ions in the fir&s;t draughts. I have heard of a &s;entence he has quoted; all I can

<P>A report of the &s;ecretary of the trea&s;ury, on the exci&s;e law, was made to the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives, on the 6th of March, 1792.

The&s;e &s;trictures were copied into the Pitt&s;burgh Ga|zette, I have under&s;tood by reque&s;t.

<P>A great variety of publications had appeared, in the mean time, in the we&s;tern paper, on the &s;ubject of the exci&s;e; &s;ome of which were attributed to me, but in which I had no hand. A publication of con&s;iderable length, &s;igned John Neville, had appeared in a pamphlet. The object was to reconcile the people with the law. It was an&s;wered, in a variety of publications, in the gazette. I was not the author of any. The addre&s;s was of no u&s;e. Profe&s;&s;ions of di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s were held out, which were thought to be ab&s;urd, as it mu&s;t have &s;truck every one, that in accepting the office, he could have no other object in view but the making money.</P>

<P>A SECOND general meeting took place at Pitt&s;burgh, on the 21&s;t day of April, 1792. I do not find any previous adverti&s;ement in the gazettes, calling that meeting, nor do I kno<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> how it was brought about.

<P><Q>Re&s;olved, therefore, That in future we will con&s;ider &s;uch per&s;ons as unworthy of our friend&s;hip, have no intercour&s;e or dealings with them, withdraw from them every a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and withhold all the comforts of life, which depend upon tho&s;e duties that as men and fellow citizens, we owe to each other, and upon all occa&s;ions, treat the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> with that contempt they de&s;erve; and that it be, and it is hereby mo&s;t earne&s;tly recommended to the people at large, to follow the &s;ame line of conduct towards them.</Q></P></NOTE>.</P>
<P>I had been elected a delegate from Allegheny county, but declined &s;erving. I recollect to have been a&s;ked by &s;ome of the members whether the going &s;o far could be con&s;trued trea&s;on. I thought not. I was told by the member, that the &s;ame que&s;tion had been put to my brother of the bar, and that he was of opinion, that it did not amount to trea&s;on. It &s;truck me to be going to the utmo&s;t boundary of right re&s;erved by the people. On the principle of political virtue, nothing but ex|treme nece&s;&s;ity could ju&s;tify it; it is the la&s;t &s;tep &s;hort of u&s;ing actual force. It is a the&s;is I &s;hould like to &s;ee well di&s;cu&s;&s;ed. Gallatin in his &s;peech in the legi&s;lature of Penn&s;ylvania, on the que&s;tion of the we&s;tern election, &s;eems to have given it up, and calls it his "political &s;in;" he would &s;eem, on reflection, to have con&s;idered it, not, I pre&s;ume, as a mi&s;demeanor, cogniza|ble by the law, but as cen&s;urable, on the ground of ab&s;tract pol|itical virtue. I would certainly think it &s;o, unle&s;s in the ca&s;e &s;tated, viz. as the la&s;t &s;tep, before u&s;ing force.</P>
<P>In a republican government, I would wi&s;h to &s;ee an office of lucre, at all times con&s;idered as illiberal, in order to pre|vent a competition for it, and to hinder men, rich enough already, to be gra&s;ping at it, while there are men in the coun|try
<PB N="21" REF="028332_0218_0FD8982170AA4468">
equally qualified, who have large families, and have more need of it. When I &s;ay illiberal, I mean in the &s;ame point of view as &s;ervile employments, which a man of ea&s;y fortune may be above, and leave to others who mu&s;t live by them; but it would be wrong to &s;ay, that I would not eat or drink with &s;uch, though at the &s;ame time, I might keep up a di&s;tinction of ra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">k, not on the principle of pride, but on that of a&s;&s;ociating with tho&s;e in the &s;ame habits with my&s;elf.</P>
<P>Pre&s;ident Monte&s;quieu <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Book 13th. Chapter 10th. Spirit of Laws.</NOTE>, has carried the idea further; and con&s;iders it a &s;ymptom of ruin in a republican government, when an office in the revenue, becomes, by means of the pro|fits, an object of honour. His words are as follows: "All is lo&s;t when the lucrative employment <HI>of a collector of the revenue</HI> comes to be al&s;o by its profits, an honourable employment.

<P>I think the reflection ju&s;t. It marks a total lo&s;s of public virtue; it &s;aps the very principle, which is the love of character, and fixes in the heart the root of all that is evil, "the love of money. Surely to correct this, by attaching contempt to a legi&s;lator, de&s;cending to be a tax-gatherer, if Monte&s;quieu be be right, is nothing more than recurring to fir&s;t principles, and re&s;toring the republic.</P>
<P>With regard to a different object, which was that of procur|ing a repeal of the law, it is a different matter, and if at all ju&s;|tifiable, it mu&s;t be as the la&s;t re&s;ort.</P>

It would be difficult to &s;ay, whe|ther they inflamed the oppo&s;ition; becau&s;e it would be difficult to add to the heat or flame of it. It has been &s;een what the force of it was, from the fir&s;t. A breath in favour of the law, was &s;ufficient to ruin any man. It was con&s;idered as a badge of toryi&s;m. A clergyman was not thought orthodox in the pul|pit, unle&s;s again&s;t the law: a phy&s;ician was not capable of ad|mini&s;tering medicine, unle&s;s his principles were right in this re|&s;pect: a lawyer could have got no practice, without at lea&s;t concealing his &s;entiments, if for the law: a merchant, at a country &s;tore, could not get cu&s;tom.

<P>The imagination of the people had pre&s;ented the exci&s;e in every &s;hape, and on every &s;ubject. Riding through the coun|try with a gentleman, lawyer Patter&s;on of Harri&s;burg, and coming to a hou&s;e, he enquired of a woman, who &s;hewed her|&s;elf at the door, what quantity of land was in that farm? and who the owner was? She declined an&s;wering; informing him, as &s;he did not know him, he might be the exci&s;e officer. On another occa&s;ion, I was amu&s;ed with the fears of an hone&s;t wo|man, who was under great concern, from an account &s;he had heard, that the exci&s;e was to be put next upon the &s;pinning-wheels. I told her that was nothing to what was talked of, the putting it upon night-caps. She had one on.</P>
<P>It might be &s;aid, with plau&s;ibility, that the keeping the at|tention of the people to a con&s;titutional redre&s;s, by re&s;olves of committees and addre&s;&s;es to repre&s;entatives, was calculated to re&s;train the people from that force which they were prone to u&s;e, and which otherwi&s;e might have &s;ooner broke out; but on this I &s;hall hazard no opinion.</P>

<P>There is one of the&s;e per&s;ons, however, who is not hurt; but, on the contrary, affects to have been irreproachable in all things. I &s;peak of my brother of the bar. He was a leading member of the Pitt&s;burgh committee. He was unque&s;tionably a man, at lea&s;t in his own opinion, of great popular influence. In the fall of this very year 1791, he was a candidate for a &s;eat in Congre&s;s, and in the di&s;trict election ran again&s;t Findley. Two years after he ran again&s;t Thomas Scot. Where was he when actual violence began to &s;hew it&s;elf? Probably &s;o immer&s;|ed in &s;tudy, to fit him&s;elf for a &s;eat in the legi&s;lature, that he never heard of them. He had ju&s;t awakened from his books, time enough, when the judiciary came to this country, to in|form them, that they ought to hang me. If I de&s;erved hang|ing, I leave it to the reader, whether he did not de&s;erve to be at lea&s;t choaked a little, for what he did in the Pitt&s;burgh com|mittee.</P>
<P>It will be a&s;ked, Was there no legal cognizance taken of the outrages, at an early period? As to what was done in ma&s;k, it was impo&s;&s;ible; becau&s;e the perpetrators were not known. No information could be made, or at lea&s;t was made. In one ca&s;e, in Allegheny county, where an outrage was committed, cog|nizance was taken, and the offenders brought to ju&s;tice. It was in the ca&s;e of an attack upon a certain Richmond, who had been a&s;&s;aulted, and detained by force, to prevent his coming to the court, to give te&s;timony of an attack upon a certain Wil|&s;on, who had been mi&s;taken for an exci&s;e officer. This Wil&s;on was a man &s;omewhat deranged in his intellects, or at lea&s;t in a manner bordering on crazine&s;s, and either imagined him&s;elf <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o be an exci&s;e officer, or affected to be &s;uch; and on making &s;ome enquiries relative to &s;tills, he was &s;eized, by per&s;ons unknown,
<PB N="24" REF="028332_0221_0FD8982492AF8DD8">
and branded, tar and feathered, &amp;c. Richmond, who had know|ledge of the per&s;ons, had informed, and bills of indictment were found again&s;t them, on the oath of Richmond; but in or|der to keep him away, on a trial of the traver&s;e, he was him|&s;elf a&s;&s;aulted, and detained from the court, as has been &s;aid. Seventeen concerned in the a&s;&s;ault upon Richmond, were in|dicted on his information; and on trial, at September &s;e&s;&s;ion, 1792, the greater part were convicted, and fined. I have &s;tated the above, in order to rebut the allegation, that the courts of ju&s;tice have refu&s;ed to take cognizance of outrages, in the ca&s;e of the exci&s;e law <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I have heard the di&s;trict judge cen&s;ured, as di&s;po&s;ed rather to &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">our an oppo&s;ition to the law, than repre&s;s it; and it has been given, as a proof of this, that he handed a poetical compo&s;ition to the printer, in Pitt&s;burgh, containing ridicule on George Clymer, in&s;pector general of the revenue, which, at my reque&s;t, the printer did not in&s;ert. This is true; but the com|po&s;ition re&s;pected nothing more, that I recollect, than the incidents, on the part of the in&s;pector general, in coming to the country; and as &s;ome alter|cation had taken place, between the in&s;pector and the judge, this la&s;t was di&s;po&s;ed to be amu&s;ed, with a compo&s;ition that re&s;pected the ground of it. I &s;poke to the printer, not to in&s;ert it, as it might be attributed to me, as all paragraphs u&s;ually were, by people at a di&s;tance.</NOTE>.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. V.</HEAD>
<P>A Democratic &s;ociety was in&s;tituted in the town of Wa&s;hing|ton, in the month of April, 1794, on the &s;ame principles, and in corre&s;pondence, as I have under&s;tood, with &s;ocieties of the &s;ame denomination, in New-York, Philadelphia, and el&s;ewhere. I have traced no re&s;olutions, or proceedings, of this &s;ociety of Wa&s;hington, with regard to the exci&s;e law.</P>
<P>Prior to this, a &s;ociety, of a nature much more democratic, had been in&s;tituted in the neighbourhood of Mingo creek. The place of convening was u&s;ually the meeting-hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Various principles combined to produce this &s;ociety. Some of the leaders in it, had been di&s;appointed in their wi&s;hes to be ju&s;tices of the peace, or to be upon the bench, as a&s;&s;ociate judg|es; others were harra&s;&s;ed with &s;uits from ju&s;tices and courts, and wi&s;hed a le&s;s expen&s;ive tribunal <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The &s;ociety was to have a cognizance of &s;uits between the members, and they actually went on to determine in all ca&s;es.</NOTE>; others favoured it, as an engine of election for county offices, or for the &s;tate legi&s;lature; others, from a de&s;ire natural to men, of being con&s;picuous. This &s;ociety was the cradle of the in&s;urrection. They did not, as a &s;ociety, project the fir&s;t outrages, but they naturally &s;prung from that licentiou&s;ne&s;s of idea, with regard to law and liberty, which the articles of their in&s;titution held out, or were calcu|lated to produce.</P>
<P>A &s;ociety of a &s;ingular nature, was in&s;tituted in a part of the county of Allegheny, in April following. We have the fir&s;t account of it in the gazette of April 26th, 1794 <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>At a meeting of the &s;ociety from the four counties, at the hou&s;e of Sa|muel Sinclair, at the mouth of Yough, April 15th, 1794.</P>
<P>Re&s;olve. That the following be propo&s;ed, as a con&s;titution for forming a republic, or &s;ociety, in each colonel's di&s;trict, throughout the four coun|ties.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P>The articles of this &s;ociety are to the &s;ame effect with that of Mingo creek, and equally calculated to ab&s;tract the public mind from the e&s;tabli&s;hed order of the laws<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Art. 1&s;t. Sect. 6th. "The pre&s;ident, council, or deputies, for any &s;peech or debates in the &s;ociety, &s;hall not be que&s;tioned in any other place."</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="028332_0223_0FD89826001145E0">The account given me, by Mr. M'Donald, the &s;ecretary, or rather the apology made, for in&s;tituting this &s;ociety, was, that the people of the &s;ettlement were outragious to do &s;omething, on account of the exci&s;e law, the co&s;ts on the &s;uits before ju&s;|tices, court expence, and &s;alaries of officers; and were deter|mined to do &s;omething, and had talked of breaking up general Neville, and burning Pitt&s;burgh; and that the in&s;tituting a &s;o|ciety, was thought of, by the more moderate, as a means of employing the people's minds, and to keep them deliberating in&s;tead of acting. Be this as it may, it does not &s;eem to have had the effect, but rather to have accelerated the commence|ment of actual violence. It appears, that at the June court, at Wa&s;hington, 1794, there was conver&s;ation, and by &s;ome of the members of that &s;ociety, of a nature with that mentioned by Mc'Donald, viz. the &s;eizing Neville, and breaking up the office in Pitt&s;burgh <NOTE PLACE="foot">Art. 2d. Sect. 3d. "Nothing in this con&s;titution, &s;hall be &s;o con&s;trued, as to prejudice any claims of the United States."</NOTE>.</P>
<P>It was on the verge of Mingo creek &s;ettlement, that the mar&s;hall was oppo&s;ed in &s;erving the fir&s;t proce&s;s. He had &s;erv|ed proce&s;s without mole&s;tation, in the counties of Bedford, We&s;tmoreland, Wa&s;hington, and Fayette; and in Fayette county a meeting of di&s;tillers had been called, at which Galla|tin a&s;&s;i&s;ted, and it had been determined to employ council at the federal court, to defend the &s;uits. It was in &s;erving the re|maining proce&s;s in the county of Allegheny, on the verge of the Mingo creek &s;ettlement, that the oppo&s;ition broke out into actual ho&s;tility. The mar&s;hall had &s;erved &s;everal writs in a &s;in|gle neighbourhood, in the cour&s;e of one morning. Tho&s;e, on whom he had &s;erved the fir&s;t, had collected and pur&s;ued him, while he was &s;erving the la&s;t. The people left the harve&s;t fields, and took up arms. There was no pre-concert, no de|termined object. It had nothing in it, but the e&s;&s;ence of a mob. I attribute little to the circum&s;tance of general Neville being in company, or to that of a writ being &s;erved in a har|ve&s;t field, among&s;t a groupe of reapers; nor do I attribute much even to the circum&s;tance of a number of men being a&s;&s;em|bled at a board of appeals, in ca&s;e of fines for a neglect of militia duty, held that day by the in&s;pector of brigade, at Ben|jamin Parkin&s;on's. I re&s;olve it rather into the e&s;tabli&s;hed tem|per <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Te&s;timony of Neville the younger in court.</NOTE>
<PB N="27" REF="028332_0224_0FD8982D3171E9C8">
of the country, than into accidental cau&s;es. Be this as it may, the inflammation &s;pread rapidly. The quiting harve&s;t fields, a mo&s;t urgent bu&s;ine&s;s with the farmer, was a &s;trong proof to me of the violence of the people. The whole &s;ettlement was in commotion &s;uddenly. The fir&s;t party that attacked Neville's hou&s;e, were but a &s;quad from the bulk that were behind, in a|gitation, con&s;ulting what mea&s;ures to pur&s;ue. Holcroft, in his retreat was met at Couche's fort by numbers, who had come forward di&s;po&s;ed to violent purpo&s;e. The&s;e returning, rou&s;ed others, and in the cour&s;e of one night the body was a&s;&s;embled to the amount of at lea&s;t 500 men, that met at Couche's fort. A committee <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">as here cho&s;en to direct the operations, and it was under their orders, occa&s;ionally given, that the people marched. The flags pa&s;&s;ed and re-pa&s;&s;ed between them and tho&s;e that attempted to defend the hou&s;e of the in&s;pector.</P>
<P>From the preceeding &s;tatement it will appear, that the idea of "an individual projecting the in&s;urrection," is without foundation. It originated on the broad ba&s;is of popular preju|dice. However, it may be that leading men, at home or, a|broad, contributed by &s;peeches, or by writings to fo&s;ter, and &s;upport that prejudice. I am per&s;uaded, that no dige&s;t was ever made in the minds of any one, to rou&s;e the people to an actual and general outrage.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING given the preceeding hi&s;tory of incidents which led to it, I addre&s;s my&s;elf to rebut tho&s;e pre&s;umptions that I have heard alledged again&s;t my&s;elf, as projecting the di&s;turbance, or having a privacy with the coun&s;els of tho&s;e who did. As to the grounds of my intimacy with Mar&s;hal, or my &s;uppo&s;ed pri|vacy with his councils, I have &s;tated every particular that is within the recollection of my mind. As to Bradford, I was up|on terms of apparent intimacy; and of that I give the follow|ing account:</P>
<P>It is well known to gentlemen of the bar, that lawyers who re&s;ide in a county, u&s;ually bring the &s;uits, and it re&s;ts with them, in mo&s;t ca&s;es to recommend to clients, the a&s;&s;i&s;tants out of tho&s;e who ride the circuit, whom they may employ on the trial of the cau&s;e. Bradford, though not a great lawyer, was a popular one, and I had found it u&s;eful, at a time when I was &s;truggling to re&s;tore my practice, to &s;tand well with him. I had found my account in it &s;till on, and the very advantage which I had derived, independent of any principle of philanthro|py, e&s;tabli&s;hed in my mind a good will for the man. But I was thought to have an intimacy with him, which I had not. It was in appearance con&s;iderable, but not much in fact; for he was not a man of much &s;entiment, and my acquaintance with him went no further, that the intere&s;t which I had in &s;haring bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>I have heard it predicated loudly by tho&s;e, who wi&s;hed to in|volve me in any prejudice that may exi&s;t again&s;t Findley, Smi|ley, Gallatin, &amp;c. that I had fallen in with them, and formed a conjunction on the we&s;t of the mountain. After an e&s;tabli&s;h|ed difference with Findley, I had come &s;o far in the cour&s;e of nine years, as to exchange a common &s;alutation; but the fir&s;t time I gave him my hand was at Brown&s;ville, the morning I was going forward with Gallatin, to &s;upport the propo&s;itions of the commi&s;&s;ioners; I gave him my hand, and &s;aid it was time to forget differences, and join in our endeavours to avert a civil war. With Smiley I never had any difference, except what was political, and ab&s;tract; but I have not exchanged with him
<PB N="29" REF="028332_0226_0FD8982FB6C1E220">
&s;even words, the&s;e &s;even years. With Gallatin, I do not re|collect that I ever exchanged a word, in my life, until in the cour&s;e of our tran&s;actions in compo&s;ing the di&s;turbance. With none of the&s;e have I ever corre&s;ponded; to none of the&s;e have I ever &s;ent a me&s;&s;age, nor they to me. I was never of a com|mittee, or other meeting where any of them were pre&s;ent, or with which they had any thing to do. If I have not the credit of individual patronage, why &s;hould I be &s;ubject to the odium?</P>
<P>It has been &s;aid, that di&s;appointment had &s;oured my temper with the federal government, and that I was di&s;po&s;ed, if not to overthrow, at lea&s;t to embarra&s;s it. In proof of this, it is al|ledged, that in my corre&s;pondence with &s;ome gentlemen of Philadelphia, &s;ome years ago, I expre&s;&s;ed chagrin <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ith the fe|deral party in the &s;tate, and &s;aid they would find he effect of having affronted me. It is true I was chagrined, and did write to this effect. Let me explain it. It has been &s;een that while a member of the legi&s;lature of Penn&s;ylvania, in the year 1787, I had found it nece&s;&s;ary to join my&s;elf to a party. This was di&s;tingui&s;hed, at the time, by the name of anticontitutional, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> tho&s;e oppo&s;ed to the frame of government, which Penn&s;ylvania had adopted. Having &s;tood firmly in the hou&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ith tho&s;e, on all que&s;tions, I had become obnoxious to the oppo&s;ite. It was the anticon&s;titionali&s;ts that brought forward the bill for a con|vention to revi&s;e the federal government; the model framed by this convention was &s;upported by the party in the hou&s;e, to which I was attached. On my return from the legi&s;lature, I became the advocate for it in the we&s;tern country; I fought a hard battle in its favour, until it was adopted. The election for the fir&s;t repre&s;entatives was to be general through the &s;tate, and not by di&s;tricts. In order to frame a ticket, two di&s;tinct conventions were held at Lanca&s;ter and Harri&s;burgh; that at Lanca&s;ter was the federal, as it was called, or the intere&s;t to which I had been attached. Findley, who had been my adver|&s;ary, was to be taken up, as it was under&s;tood, by the Harris|burgh, or antifederal ticket. It &s;truck me to have my name brought forward in the federal ticket, in oppo&s;ition to him. I procured a delegation from the four counties of two gentlemen who attended at the Lanca&s;ter convention, and pre&s;ented my name. It was rejected. I felt the indignity, and con&s;idered my&s;elf as ab&s;olved from all engagement to the party, and ex|pre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf to this effect. But that had nothing to do either with my attachment to individuals, or to the government it&s;elf, that had been e&s;tabli&s;hed. My re&s;entment re&s;pected merely
<PB N="30" REF="028332_0227_0FD89831461BFED0">
the party in the &s;tate, and nothing el&s;e. It had been no object with me to be a repre&s;entative. I had cared nothing about it. But merely on a principle of oppo&s;ition to my adver&s;aries, I had &s;uffered my name to be carried forward; and that being the ca&s;e, I was affronted to have it thrown a&s;ide. I felt it with &s;en&s;ibility until I came to under&s;tand how it took place; viz. that it was not on the ground of per&s;onal di&s;re&s;pect to me, but on that Thomas Scott, whom they took in my place, being le&s;s exceptionable at the time, with their adver&s;aries; and of cour&s;e his name vould &s;erve the ticket more.</P>

<P>HAVING given this detail of circum&s;tances anterior to the in&s;urrection, I &s;hall now revert to the point where I was; the departure o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the army from the we&s;tern country.</P>
<P>General Morgan, with a corps of 800, enli&s;ted out of the militia that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ad cro&s;&s;ed the mountain, remained in the country, in order to &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">pport the laws, until every &s;ymptom of oppo&s;ition had di&s;appeared. In addition to this body of troops, a corps of calvary was rai&s;ed from the country it&s;elf. This body of men was &s;tationed on the Monongehela, at the di&s;tance of 14 miles from Pitt&s;burgh. Officers from this encampment were fre|quently in town. Unfavourable impre&s;&s;ions &s;till exi&s;ted among&s;t them with regard to me. Threats of a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination were fre|quently made; but I was under no apprehen&s;ion now. They were not &s;ure that the government con&s;idered me as a man that might ju&s;tifiably be murdered. Ideas, neverthele&s;s, pre|vailed with regard to the force of the civil authority; of cour&s;e there was great licence of conduct in &s;ome of tho&s;e officers. They were noi&s;y in taverns&mdash;late in their patroles through the &s;treets; the cow of a man, that had but one, was &s;tabbed&mdash;the hor&s;e of another run through the body. The&s;e acts could not be fixed upon individuals. A waggoner di&s;covering an officer about his waggon, and a&s;king abruptly who he was, was a&s;|&s;aulted. He was fortunate in warding off the blows of the cut-lo&s;s, with his waggon &s;crew, until he got into the public hou&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">u&s;t by, where he alarmed his fellow waggoners, who made a
<PB N="31" REF="028332_0228_0FD89832B33511E0">
&s;hew of attacking the officer, and pur&s;ued him. The officer e&s;|caping to his quarters, at another public hou&s;e, alarmed his fellow officers, who came out upon the waggoners, who &s;lying in their turn, were pur&s;ued. One of the&s;e waggoners was o|vertaken; two or three &s;lices were taken from his &s;kull, and a finger was cut off. The man applied to me: I brought an ac|tion for the tre&s;pa&s;s. A compromi&s;e took place, favoured by me, con&s;idering the circum&s;tances, and the man received the &s;um of 150 dollars. The name of the officer who gave the wounds, was M'Dermot. I heard a great deal &s;aid after|wards of abu&s;ive language among&s;t the corps again&s;t me, for bringing this &s;uit. M'Dermot threatened in&s;tant death, when|ever he &s;hould meet me. I gave it to be under&s;tood, that if I heard any more of it from M'Dermot, I would have him pro|&s;ecuted for the <HI>mayhem,</HI> which, by the law of our &s;tate, &s;ub|jects to hard labour and impri&s;onment. I heard no more of it.</P>
<P>An atrocious outrage was committed on a certain Balt|zoover, in the neighbourhood of the town: his hou&s;e was entered, his locks broke, his property taken, and carried away. I brought a &s;uit again&s;t an officer, who was &s;aid to command on the occa&s;ion; it was a captain Weezley of the Jer&s;ies. But it is alledged there has been a mi&s;take of the per&s;on, and that he was not the man.</P>
<P>A &s;econd outrage was committed by M'Dermot in company with others, in the hou&s;e of a certain Bayard, in Allegheny county. They demanded victuals&mdash;His wife was &s;ick&mdash;He ex|cu&s;ed him&s;elf&mdash;They in&s;i&s;ted and threatened&mdash;The man made exertions, and got &s;omething. After eating and drinking, they impri&s;oned him in his chamber, made &s;trokes at him with their &s;words&mdash;threw his bedding on the floor, danced upon it&mdash;broke his tables and chairs, and other furniture. He applied to me; I recommended to him to have his damages apprai&s;ed, make out his bill liberally, go to the camp, and demand reparation; if not made, then to return to me. The bill was made out and paid, but with many imprecations again&s;t me, to whom it had been under&s;tood, he had made application.</P>
<P>A violent tre&s;pa&s;s was committed by a captain Randolph, on a farmer of the name of M'Clure, a man greatly re&s;pectable; he was impri&s;oned in his own hou&s;e, and in&s;ulted by opprobri|ous language. I directed an indictment again&s;t the captain which has not yet been determined.</P>
<P>A troop of calvary encamped at the hou&s;e of a certain Reed, out down &s;hade trees before his hou&s;e, wantonly. I brought
<PB N="32" REF="028332_0229_0FD898344474BB58">
an action of tre&s;pa&s;s again&s;t a captain Sime&s;on, who was &s;aid to command on the occa&s;ion. Tre&s;pa&s;&s;es were committed in o|ther places, in the cour&s;e of foraging in the country. I recom|mended indictments in a number of the&s;e ca&s;es. The temper of the country was greatly ru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">led at the&s;e indignities; and the more &s;o as they &s;aw the force &s;tationed to be parade, and no|thing more. It could have no effect to &s;uppre&s;s an in&s;urrection, if any had been meditated; this was their idea, as they expre&s;&s;|ed it to me.</P>
<P>Some of the&s;e outrages had taken place in the ab&s;ence of gen|eral Morgan, on a vi&s;it to Virginia. On his return the repre|&s;entations made to him by his officers, were, doubtle&s;s, favour|vourable to them&s;elves. He was led to believe that the &s;uits were &s;tirred up by the in&s;urgent Brackenridge. The general him&s;elf could not be unwilling to admit other grounds than mi&s;|behaviour in his officers, for he had &s;et the example, and was guilty of the fir&s;t breach of the peace, in the country. It was on the per&s;on of a James M'Alli&s;ter, the keeper of a public hou&s;e. In the cour&s;e of the winter this man applied to me, and gave his &s;tory. It was when the army fir&s;t came. The man had charged a quarter of a dollar for a quart of whi&s;key to a &s;oldier. The general knocked him down with the but of his whip, and abu&s;ed him con&s;iderably. On the &s;core of the delica|cy of the time, alledging &s;udden pa&s;&s;ion and other palliatives of the general's conduct, I di&s;&s;uaded him from the pro&s;ecution.</P>
<P>On the advance of the army, a number who had been in|volved in the in&s;urrection, and were not within the amne&s;ty, or di&s;tru&s;ted the faith of the government, had ab&s;conded. O|thers were occa&s;ionally ab&s;ent. The&s;e were included in a pro|clamation by governor Lee, dated November 29, 1794. A|mong&s;t the&s;e was David Bradford, who had e&s;caped by the O|hio with con&s;iderable difficulty. A &s;mall Kentucky boat had been prepared, which was to have received him at the mouth of Grave creek; but being pur&s;ued by a man, from whom he had liberated a negro under the abolition law of Penn&s;ylvania, he was obliged to leave his hor&s;e and take a canoe. De&s;cend|ing with this, and pa&s;&s;ing Galliopolis, he was pur&s;ued by a party of four men di&s;patched from Galliopolis, by De Abecour, the commandant of the militia at that place. He had lain all night in his canoe at the mouth of Sandy creek, and had got in|to a coal boat, in the &s;ervice of the contractor, cold, wet, and hungry, about two hours before the party in pur&s;uit of him came up. They entered the boat, demanded Bradford, and
<PB N="33" REF="028332_0230_0FD89838FA829788">
took hold of his arm to drag him away. He made no re&s;i&s;tance; but a young lad of the name of &mdash; from Wa&s;hington, &s;eiz|ed a rifle, and &s;ingly defended him. He obliged the party to relinqui&s;h their intentions, and withdraw. This young lad had him&s;elf ab&s;conded, under apprehen&s;ion from having painted the device of a liberty pole. Bradford continuing his cour&s;e, was pur&s;ued by a captain Joly as far as Red Bank, which he had pa&s;&s;ed two days before. He is &s;aid to have gained the Span|i&s;h territory.</P>
<P>A number who had ab&s;conded, came in, and &s;urrendered them&s;elves to general Morgan, who di&s;mi&s;&s;ed them on parole, to appear at the federal court, at Philadelphia. There were but two of the&s;e did not appear.</P>
<P>The per&s;ons in who&s;e ca&s;e bail had been refu&s;ed by the judi|ciary, 21 in number, were conducted to the jail of Philadelphia, by a detachment of dragoons, under general White. His treatment was humane and liberal. A circum&s;tance is repre|hended in the conduct of the captain, who had the charge of them in entering the city, viz. the obliging them to wear, each, a badge of white paper in his hat, to di&s;tingui&s;h them to the people. It was a great indelicacy. It is ungenerous to in&s;ult the feelings of the mi&s;erable.</P>
<P>During the winter I had been employed in arranging bu&s;i|ne&s;s in my profe&s;&s;ion, and occa&s;ionally collecting vouchers from individuals of note, who had been privy to my &s;entiments, and witne&s;&s;ed my conduct in the cour&s;e of the in&s;urrection. In the &s;pring, being under a recognizance to attend the federal court, as a witne&s;s in the ca&s;e of the pri&s;oners &s;ent down, I went to Philadelphia. It had been the wi&s;h of the relations of the pri|&s;oners in the country, that I &s;hould appear for them. My do|ing that would depend upon circum&s;tances.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII.</HEAD>
<P>THE &s;e&s;&s;ion of the federal court for the trial of the pri&s;on|ers took place on the 4th of May, 1795. Patter&s;on, and Pe|ters, judges of the court. A motion had been made at the &s;pring term, ju&s;t before, by William Lewis, of council for the pri&s;oners, to have the trials held more in the vicinage of the we&s;tern country. It was not judged advi&s;eable to grant it. The judicary &s;y&s;tem requires an amendment in this re&s;pect. Every man is liable to be accu&s;ed, and to be under the nece&s;&s;i|ty of going 300 miles or farther, and &s;ending for his witne&s;&s;es to that di&s;tance, where his own private character is not impre&s;&s;ed on the minds of the jury, and where the credibility of the witne&s;&s;es for and again&s;t him is not equally known and impre&s;&s;ed, is a great evil. I felt this &s;trongly in my own ca&s;e, when the pro&s;|pect of an arre&s;t and trial was before me. But independent of the advantage to the pri&s;oners, in point of &s;afety, the expence of witne&s;&s;es, at &s;uch a di&s;tance is intolerable; it will not do; it mu&s;t be remedied; or the government will not exi&s;t in the affection of the people. If I could have had a trial in the we&s;|tern country, even with a jury brought from Philadelphia, I &s;hould have thought le&s;s of it; for I could have called five hundred witne&s;&s;es out of the bo&s;om of the country, to facts that would have readily acquitted me. But to call the tenth of the&s;e to &s;uch di&s;tance, was a weighty difficulty. On a retro|&s;pect it will be &s;een, that a great variety of te&s;timony would have been nece&s;&s;ary in my ca&s;e, to have done my&s;elf ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>I had heard a great deal before I left the we&s;tern country, of the obloquy that exi&s;ted again&s;t me in the city. It had been fed, and improved with all po&s;&s;ible indu&s;try by colonel Neville, and my brother of the bar, who had &s;pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> the winter in the ci|ty. Colonel Neville was of the legi&s;lature of the &s;tate, and be|ing a good deal in the be&s;t company, did me great damage. My brother of the bar not &s;o much; he was too violent. People &s;aw pa&s;&s;ion. But my impre&s;&s;ions of prejudice and obloquy, which were before me, did not equal what I found to exi&s;t. I was &s;hunned by every one. Per&s;ons who had known me for|merly,
<PB N="35" REF="028332_0232_0FD8983FA308FE80">
advancing in my way, would change their cour&s;e, or affect to &s;ee &s;ome objects on the other &s;ide of the &s;treet, &s;o as not to be under the nece&s;&s;ity to meet my eye. I was as un|willing to meet theirs, and would change my cour&s;e al&s;o, and affect to &s;ee objects. I contemplated the buildings a good deal as I walked, ca&s;ting my eyes to the upper &s;tories of the hou&s;es. A &s;tranger would have thought me a di&s;ciple of Palladio, exam|ining the architecture.</P>
<P>My brother of the bar had left the city, but colonel Neville was &s;till there. Shortly after my arrival, I heard of his &s;hewing general orders which had been i&s;&s;ued by his father-in-law, gen|eral Morgan, in which an allu&s;ion had been made to "an evil di&s;po&s;ed and profe&s;&s;ional character, &s;tirring up &s;uits again&s;t his officers <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q><TEXT>

<HEAD>Extract from the Orders.</HEAD>
<P>In taking one view of this &s;ubject, I cannot avoid a &s;u&s;picion, that &s;ome evil di&s;po&s;ed profe&s;&s;ional character, and who is an enemy to the happine&s;s of this country, has been bu&s;y in fomenting differences, and urging pro&s;ecutions of a vexatious kind, which otherwi&s;e, from the favourable opinion of the people in general, would not have exi&s;ted.</P>

</BODY>
</TEXT></Q></NOTE>." A day or two after, the&s;e orders appeared in the gazette. As the allu&s;ion would undoubtedly be applied to me by the public mind, I was hurt by the in&s;inuation, and could not avoid taking notice of it. I did it by acknowledging, and at the &s;ame time ju&s;tifying my having in&s;tituted &s;uits, and di|rected pro&s;ecutions again&s;t "unprincipled, wanton, marauding pandours of his corps." My cen&s;ure could re&s;pect only tho&s;e again&s;t whom &s;uit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> had been brought, or pro&s;ecutions directed. I have mentioned the names of tho&s;e officers in my narrative, that others may not be wounded by the epithets.</P>
<P>There was &s;aid to be in Philadelphia, &s;ome who had a warm &s;ide to the in&s;urrection, and I had &s;uppo&s;ed that &s;ome of the&s;e would have recognized me as a brother, and have given me the &s;olace of a little company. But a report which had originated in mi&s;take, or had been propagated by my adver&s;aries, de&s;troy|ed me even with the&s;e. It was that I had &s;aved my life by turning what is called &s;tate evidence. That the commi&s;&s;ioners on their arrival in the we&s;tern country, found they had occa|&s;ion for me, and brought me off with a promi&s;e of indemnity, and left me as a &s;py upon the people, and that now I was come down to fulfil that dark engagement of giving te&s;timony to hang others. On all &s;ides I &s;tood in the mo&s;t odious predi|cament. I knew the allegation would be found groundle&s;s,
<PB N="36" REF="028332_0233_0FD89841CB5805B0">
when I came to give my te&s;timony; for I had known little or nothing of the acts of individuals, at lea&s;t of tho&s;e who were to take their trials. But it was painful, in the mean time, to la|bour under &s;uch an imputation.</P>
<P>I was in the city &s;ome days before the &s;e&s;&s;ion of the court; and had found private lodgings. But the mi&s;tre&s;s of the hou&s;e, who was a widow lady, under&s;tanding who I was, expre&s;&s;ed great unea&s;ine&s;s. She took it for granted that I was to &s;tand trial, and did not like the idea of having a man hanged out of the family. I prevailed upon her to &s;uffer me to remain at lea&s;t until I was about to be put on my trial.</P>
<P>Under the predicament in which I was, I did not think it pru|dent to attend the theatre, or to go to places of public re&s;ort. I would &s;ubject my&s;elf to the indignity of looks, if not words. I attempted to amu&s;e my&s;elf a little in the &s;hops of book&s;ellers; but even the&s;e were &s;hy of me. They were afraid to have it thought that they were of the councils of in&s;urgents. My chief walks were about the dock-yards, looking at the &s;hipping, or traver&s;ing the environs of the city, viewing the improvements that had taken place. Sauntering one day to the large build|ing that is carrying on by Robert Morris, a Scotchman who had &s;ome care of the materials, not knowing me, &s;hewed me every thing with great civility? I was di&s;po&s;ed to plea&s;e him, and ob|&s;erved that I &s;uppo&s;ed this was nothing to the hou&s;es in Scotland. Na, &s;aid he, they wad na tirn thir hor&s;es into it. I que&s;tion, &s;aid I, if they would make a cow hou&s;e of it. Aye, &s;aid he, they might make a cow hou&s;e. But, &s;aid I, it can be nothing to the duke of Argyle's hou&s;e at Inverary. Na, &s;aid he, nor the duke of Bucleugh's, or lord Haddington's.</P>
<P>The &s;e&s;&s;ions of the court, began on the 4th of May. I had laid a&s;ide all thoughts of appearing in defence of the pri&s;oners. I knew my &s;tanding with the court, e&s;pecially with judge Peters, was not favourable. I had heard that he con&s;idered me as blamable; and on my pa&s;&s;ing him once in the &s;treet, he turned away his eye. I wondered at this, if he had read my examina|tion by &s;ecretary Hamilton. Perhaps he had not. That being the ca&s;e, his impre&s;&s;ions were tho&s;e which had been made by the <HI>ex parte</HI> te&s;timony taken again&s;t me, by the information and adverti&s;ements of my adver&s;aries. Independent of the court, I knew that I mu&s;t &s;tand ill with the jury; and what I &s;hould &s;ay would be con&s;idered as the pleading of one criminal for another. Be&s;ides all this, I did not know that I would be permitted. If I had been involved in the in&s;urrection, a crime aggravated a

thou&s;and fold in the ca&s;e of a man who knew the law, I mu&s;t be con&s;idered as unworthy of appearing at any bar, in the light of a coun&s;el for a client. It was not without he&s;itation that I ventured to take a &s;eat at the bar; and when I did this, it was only ju&s;t to &s;hew my&s;elf and retire again. In the ca&s;es of pri|&s;oners or others attending under recognizance, having given him, proof was procured to explain que&s;tionable circum&s;tances with regard to the &s;ignature of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, and they were di&s;mi&s;|&s;ed. Bills of indictment were &s;ent up again&s;t others, and a num|ber found; &s;ome for trea&s;on, and &s;ome for mi&s;demeanors. I do not mean to give the hi&s;tory of the judiciary proceedings; under&s;tanding that a report will be made by a gentleman of the bar who attended. I was examined as a witne&s;s only on three occa&s;ions, and this was with regard to the general hi&s;tory of par|ticular &s;cenes; for I know nothing of the acts of the individuals.</P>
<P>In the cour&s;e of the trial it became pretty clear that the im|pre&s;&s;ions with regard to me, as having been involved in the in&s;urrection, were groundle&s;s; that on the contrary, I had merit in oppo&s;ing it, and quieting the di&s;turbance. The people began to talk le&s;s of having me hanged in&s;tead of the accu&s;ed, and the gentlemen of the bar became &s;ociable; and the court complai&s;|ant.</P>

<P>THE Epithets of "unprincipled, wanton, and marauding pandours," which I had applied to the officers of the corps of Morgan, in my an&s;wer to the in&s;inuation in his general orders, had given great offence to the general and his army. The younger Neville had enclo&s;ed the publication to a colonel Ste|phen&s;on, with &s;uch comments as were calculated to inflame pa&s;|&s;ion. The very compliment of being &s;ingled out from a whole body, to be the champion of their honour, was calculated to en|gage ho&s;tility. This col. Stephen&s;on had been an officer in the late war with Britain, and had di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf as a man of courage, bordering on temerity. And is &s;aid to have fought &s;e|veral duels with more &s;ucce&s;s than humanity could wi&s;h. He was a Penn&s;ylvanian; in which ca&s;e, le&s;s imputation of Virginia influence would exi&s;t in his accompli&s;hing revenge. He had

<P>The only difficulty was to re&s;train them&s;elves until I &s;hould return to the country. In the mean time they killed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> in imagination&punc; the air was out a thou&s;and times with their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ee, wi&s;hing it to be me.

His face wore the marks of this, being &s;eared from the forehead to the chin in &s;everal places.</P>
<P>No per&s;on dared to write to me, to inform me of the danger; not knowing in what point of view I &s;tood below; and whether it might not be a proof of guilt in them to &s;eem to be concerned for me. Neverthele&s;s&punc; there were per&s;ons of humanity who ventured to &s;ignify their apprehen&s;ions on my account, by notes to individuals in Philadelphia from the we&s;tward, who gave me warning of the threats again&s;t me. It was the opinion of the&s;e, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> would be mo&s;t advi&s;able for me to remain below until Morgan's troop<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> left the country. I thought not; becau&s;e I felt pa&s;&s;ion, and wi&s;hed to pre&s;ent my&s;elf immediately, in order to &s;ee the re&s;ult of this fury. I was impatient to &s;et out for Pitt&s;burg. As &s;oon as di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from the court, I was upon my way, and arrived at home &s;peedily. The &s;cene had greatly changed; a difference had taken place in the camp it&s;elf. A cap|tain Low had a&s;&s;aulted and beaten M'Dermot; general Morgan had been obliged to put Stephen&s;on under an arre&s;t, to keep him from killing Randolph. Sime&s;on having &s;een writs after writs &s;erved in the camp, and the troops making no re&s;i&s;tance&punc; began to think there was &s;omething forcible in law, and had gone to Wa&s;hington to &s;tudy it. There were a few &s;tragglers &s;till at Pitt&s;burg, that talked of killing me; but what was every body's bu&s;ine&s;s was nobody's bu&s;ine&s;s. The thing was who &s;hould do it. No one di&s;turbed me; and I am alive at the very moment I am writing this narrative.</P>
<P>It having been thought no longer nece&s;&s;ary to continue a body of troops in the country, the civil authority appearing in compe|tent operation, by orders from the &s;ecretary at war, they were di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, and general Morgan took his leave of us, in an affec|tionate addre&s;s, dated at his camp, June 3, 1795.</P>
<P>There was every rea&s;on to confide in the peaceful di&s;po&s;ition of the country, for tho&s;e, that had remained with him, were
<PB N="39" REF="028332_0236_0FD8984ABA8E20A8">
chiefly weak and &s;ickly men, that were unable to recro&s;s the mountain; and a fever breaking out in the camp, affected them &s;till more, and rendered them unfit for &s;ervice; neverthele&s;s the country made not the lea&s;t movement to di&s;turb them, notwith|&s;tanding every po&s;&s;ible provocation of abu&s;ive words and in&s;ulting actions. The four battallions of militia that had been rai&s;ed from the country were the greater part of them in&s;urgents, and had been among&s;t the mo&s;t trouble&s;ome. If joining in abu&s;e and in&s;ult to the people, was a proof of &s;incere conver&s;ion, it exi&s;ted. So that all things con&s;idered, the di&s;mi&s;&s;ing the army at this period, was a ju&s;tifiable-mea&s;ure.</P>

<HEAD>CONCLUSION.</HEAD>
<P>I HAVE now fini&s;hed the detail which I had in view. That my information may not have been correct in all ca&s;es; that my memory may have led me into error; that my imagination may have coloured facts, is po&s;&s;ible; but that I have deviated from the &s;trictne&s;s of truth, knowingly, is what I will not admit. That I have been under the painful nece&s;&s;ity of giving touches which may affect the feelings of &s;ome per&s;ons, is evident. But it has been with all the delicacy in my power, con&s;i&s;tent with doing ju&s;tice to my&s;elf. If I have done them inju&s;tice, they have the &s;ame means with me in their power; an appeal to the public. This is the great and re&s;pectable tribunal at which I &s;tand. For though I have not been arraigned at the bar of a court of ju&s;tice, yet from the fir&s;t moment of obloquy again&s;t me, I have con&s;i|dered my&s;elf an arre&s;ted man, and put upon my country. From that day, the morning &s;un &s;hone to me le&s;s bright; the light of night has been more ob&s;cure; the human countenance pre&s;en|ted nothing but &s;u&s;picion. The voice of man hurt me; I almo&s;t hated life it&s;elf. For who can &s;ay that I have pur&s;ued riches? Who can &s;ay I have been a devotee of plea&s;ure? Who can &s;ay I do not love fame? What then have I, if I loo&s;e the hope of e&s;|timation? Was I a traitor to my country? A&s;k me, Was I a traitor to that cla&s;s of men with whom I am in grade of educa|tion? Would I di&s;grace the prai&s;e of &s;cience, the advantage of an enlightened reading? Who am taught to know that virtue is glory; and benevolence and truth, that alone which can a&s;&s;imilate
<PB N="40" REF="028332_0237_0FD8984C430CA3C0">
with the Divine nature. And what greater deviation than to di&s;turb the &s;ettled order of a government, while that government remains republican? Such owes it, and &s;uch to be &s;upported; and any man who touches it with any other views than to rub the wheels and &s;prings, de&s;erves the anathema of the people.</P>
<P>If &s;trictures are made in reply to my &s;tatement, let it be with moderation equally, at lea&s;t, to that which has been &s;hewn by me. For &s;hould I be under the nece&s;&s;ity of rejoining, it will be with more &s;everity. I have attributed a great deal to the mi&s;con|ception of any adver&s;aries, the Neville's e&s;pecially. But if I find that after this development of all tran&s;actions, they &s;till go on to repre&s;ent me as criminal, I &s;hall re&s;olve it into voluntary prejudice, and addre&s;s my&s;elf to explain the grounds of it. I had much rather he relieved from the nece&s;&s;ity, by a ce&s;&s;ation of ho&s;tilities.</P>

I have noted the above to &s;hew the rigour of the common law, and the fluc|tuation of the &s;tatute law of England, in regard of the extent of trea&s;on.</P>
<P>The table of trea&s;on in England at this pre&s;ent day, is that of 25th Edward III. By the trea&s;on law of the United States, this table is reduced to a &s;ingle item; viz. "that of levying war again&s;t the king in his realm, or being adherent to the

<P>The words of our act are, "if any per&s;on or per&s;ons, ow|ing allegiance to the United States of America, &s;hall levy war again&s;t them, or &s;hall adhere to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort within the United States, or el&s;ewhere."</P>
<P>My deduction now is, 1. That an immen&s;e &s;oftening has taken place in the law of England, from what it was by the common law, in regard of the extent of trea&s;on. 2. That by the trea&s;on law of the United States, it is &s;oftened &s;till more as to the extent.</P>
<P>It will be &s;een, in the &s;econd place, what improvement there has been of the common law, in regard of trial. By the com|mon law, no over of indictment was allowed before arraign|ment; no copy before trial; no council, except on point of law; no proce&s;s, to compel witne&s;&s;es for the defendant to ap|pear; not upon oath, when they gave their te&s;timony; no lim|itation of the pro&s;ecution.</P>
<P>By 7th William III, it is provided that a copy of the pannel be given two days before trial.</P>
<P>Compul&s;ory proce&s;s for witne&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>Limitation of pro&s;ecution to three years, contrary to the maxim of the common law. <HI>Nullum tempus occurrit Regi.</HI></P>
<P>By the common law of the United States the pro&s;ecution is limited to three years. "A copy of the indictment, and a li&s;t of the jury, and witne&s;&s;es to be produced on the trial for prov|ing the &s;aid indictment, mentioning the names and places of a|bode of &s;uch witne&s;&s;es and jurors, is to be delivered to the ac|cu&s;ed at lea&s;t three entire days before he &s;hall be tried for the &s;ame." He is allowed coun&s;el to be employed by him&s;elf, or if not able him&s;elf to employ, coun&s;el to be a&s;&s;igned by the court; he is entitled to compul&s;ory proce&s;s to procure the at|tendance of witne&s;&s;es on his behalf; and tho&s;e witne&s;&s;es are heard upon oath.</P>
<P>Thus the trea&s;on law of the United States, improves in &s;ome particulars, even the amelioration &s;tatute of William III.</P>
<P>Let us &s;ee, in the third place, what has been the change in the nature of the proof nece&s;&s;ary to fix the crime of trea&s;on.</P>
<P>By the common law one witne&s;s was &s;ufficient.

<P>While &s;uch was the proce&s;s of legi&s;lative improvement in re|gard of proof in ca&s;e of trea&s;on, did the judges keep an equal pace in favour of humanity in the con&s;truction of tho&s;e &s;tatutes? No; their leaning con&s;tantly was again&s;t the accu&s;ed; for near a century<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">17. Fo&s;ter. 232.</NOTE>, the &s;tatute of 1 Edward VI. was little regarded, or it was rendered <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ugatory; by the extraordinary re&s;olution, "that one witne&s;s of his own knowledge, and another by hear|&s;ay, <HI>from him,</HI> though at third or fourth hand, made two wit|ne&s;&s;es or accu&s;ers within the act." Even in ca&s;es where the ac|cu&s;ed in&s;i&s;ted &s;trongly or the benefit of this act, the coun&s;el for the crown has gone or in the method formerly practi&s;ed, read|ing examinations and confe&s;&s;ions of per&s;ons &s;uppo&s;ed to be ac|complices; &s;ome living and ame&s;nable, others lately hanged for the &s;ame trea&s;on.</P>
<P>In &s;ucceeding trials, the pri&s;oners have been told that the &s;tatutes of Edward VI, were repealed, particularly that which regards two witne&s;&s;es face to face; "that this law had been found dangerous to the crown."</P>
<P>When the people of all ranks and parties in England had been learning moderation in the &s;chool of adver&s;ity, light began to dawn upon them. The judges were at length brought to attend to the &s;tatute of Edward VI; but gave it a con&s;truction unfavourable to the accu&s;ed: viz. "that admitting two witne&s;|&s;es to be nece&s;&s;ary, yet one witne&s;s to one overt act, and ano|ther to another overt act, of the &s;ame &s;pecies of trea&s;on, are two &s;ufficient witne&s;&s;es within the act." The judges drew the legi&s;lature after them in this illiberal con&s;truction of the &s;tatute, and by 7 William II, it is &s;anctioned by the clau&s;e, "on the oath or te&s;timony of two lawful witne&s;&s;es, either both of them to the &s;ame overt act, or one of them to one, and the other of them to another overt act of the &s;ame trea&s;on." But at the &s;ame time, the illiberal con&s;tructions of the judges are rectified
<PB N="44" REF="028332_0241_0FD898524669F7C0">
re&s;trained in another very material particular; it is provided by &s;ection 4th, that where "two or more di&s;tinct trea&s;ons of divers heads, or kinds, be alledged in one bill of indictment, one witne&s;s produced to prove one of the &s;aid trea&s;ons, and another witne&s;s produced to prove another of the &s;aid trea&s;ons, &s;hall not be deemed or taken to be two witne&s;&s;es to the &s;ame trea|&s;on.</P>
<P>Another error in the deci&s;ion of the judges is corrected, or at lea&s;t the con&s;truction given by them, is ameliorated by 7 William, chapter 3d, &s;ection 8th, by which it is provided "that no evidence &s;hall be admitted o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> given of any overt act, not expre&s;sly laid in the indictment."</P>
<P>By the trea&s;on law of the United States, a great improve|ment has been gained on the &s;tatute of 7 William. The proof demanded by o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> law is, "the te&s;timony of two witne&s;&s;|es to the &s;ame overt act of trea&s;on, whereof indicted." And by our act, the con&s;truction given by the judges, at &s;ome period in England, to the clau&s;e of the &s;tatute of 1&s;t Edward VI, is rectified. The "willingly and without violence confe&s;&s;ing the &s;ame," had been con&s;trued to be a confe&s;&s;ion out of court, made however ca&s;ually: this is fixed to a confe&s;&s;ion "in an open court."</P>
<P>It will be &s;een that the deci&s;ion of the Engli&s;h judges have oppo&s;ed the improving mind of the legi&s;lature; they have re|duced it from time to time, contrary to the natural and hu|mane meaning&punc; by &s;ubtile and unrea&s;onable con&s;truction. But in a&s;certaining the nece&s;&s;ary proof of trea&s;on, the law of Con|gre&s;s has corrected all this, and fixed it on the ba&s;is of rea&s;on and humanity.</P>
<P>The only que&s;tion now to be con&s;idered, or at lea&s;t the only que&s;tion which I &s;hall con&s;ider, is, What &s;hall be &s;aid to be a "levying war?" I &s;hall &s;tate fir&s;t what by the deci&s;ion of the judges of England, has been con&s;trued to be a levying war.</P>
<P>It would &s;trike the common mind, that the taking <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> to dethrone the king, or to change the government, could alone amount to a levying war; that there mu&s;t be not only an a&s;&s;em|bling in arms, but an <HI>animus &s;ubvertendi,</HI> or intention of over|throwing in the ca&s;e. But it has been carried much further by the judges. To explain this, I cannot &s;erve the public better, than by tran&s;cribing a chapter from the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible writer on this &s;ubject; that is judge Fo&s;ter&punc; it is chapter 2d, of di&s;|cour&s;e 1&s;t, of high trea&s;on, on the clau&s;e <HI>of l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">vying war, and adhering the king's enemies.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="028332_0242_0FD89853C4EF3AB8">"Lord chief ju&s;tice Hale &s;peaking of &s;uch unlawful a&s;&s;emblies as may amount to a levying of war within the 25 E. 3, taketh a difference between tho&s;e in&s;urrections which have carried the ap|pearance of an army formed under readers, and provided with mi|litary weapons, and with drums, colours, &amp;c. and tho&s;e other di&s;|orderly, tumultuous a&s;&s;emblies, which have been drawn toge|ther and conducted to purpo&s;es manife&s;tly unlawful, but without any of the &s;hew and apparatus of war before mentioned.</P>
<P>I do not think any great &s;tre&s;s can be laid on that di&s;tinction. It is true, that in ca&s;e of levying war, the indictments generally charge that the defendents were armed and arrayed in a warlike manner; and where the ca&s;e would admit of it, the other cir|cum&s;tances of &s;words, guns, drums, colours, &amp;c. have been ad|ded. But I think the merits of the ca&s;e have never turned &s;ing|ly on any of tho&s;e circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>In the ca&s;es of Damaree and Purcha&s;e, which are the la&s;t <HI>print|ed</HI> ca&s;es that have come in judgment on the point of con&s;truc|tive levying war, there was nothing <HI>given in evidence</HI> of the u&s;u|al pageantry of war, no military weapons, no banners or drums, nor any regular con&s;ultation previous to the ri&s;ing. And yet the want of the&s;e circum&s;tances weighed nothing with the court, though the pri&s;oners coun&s;el in&s;i&s;ted much on that matter. The number of the in&s;urgents &s;upplied the want of military weapons; and they were provided with axes, crows, and other tools of the like nature, proper for the mi&s;chief they intended to effect.</P>
<Q>&mdash;Furor arma mini&s;trat.</Q>
<P>Sect. 1. The true criterion therefore in all the&s;e ca&s;es is, <HI>Quo animo</HI> did the parties a&s;&s;emble. For if the a&s;&s;embly be upon ac|count of &s;ome <HI>private</HI> quarrel, or to take revenge on <HI>particular</HI> per&s;ons, the &s;tatute of trea&s;ons hath already determined that point in favour of the &s;ubject.
<Q>If, &s;aith the &s;tatute, any man ride <HI>openly</HI> [&s;o the word <HI>de&s;couvert</HI> ought to have been rendered] or &s;ecretly with men of arms again&s;t any other to &s;lay or rob him, or to take and keep him 'till he make fine for his deliverance, it is not the mind of the king nor his council that in &s;uch ca&s;e it &s;hall be adjudged trea&s;on; but it &s;hall be adjudged felony or tre&s;pa&s;s according to the laws of the land of <HI>old times u&s;ed,</HI> and according as the ca&s;e requireth</Q>

<P N="2">2dly, The words of the fir&s;t clau&s;e de&s;criptive of the offence, "if any man ride armed openly or &s;ecretly with men of arms," did in the language of the&s;e times, mean nothing le&s;s than the a&s;&s;embling bodies of men, friends, tenants, or dependents, arm|ed and arrayed in a warlike manner, in order to effect &s;ome pur|po&s;e or other by dint of numbers and &s;uperior &s;trength. And yet tho&s;e a&s;&s;emblies &s;o formed and arra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed if drawn together for purpo&s;es of a private nature, were not deemed trea&s;onable.</P>

The ca&s;es of the earls of Glouce&s;ter and Hereford, and many other ca&s;es cited by Hale, &s;ome before the &s;tatute of trea&s;ons, and others after it, tho&s;e a&s;&s;emblies though attended many of them with blood&s;hed and with the ordinary apparatus of war, were not held to be trea&s;onable a&s;&s;emblies. For they were not in con|&s;truction of law, rai&s;ed again&s;t the king or his royal maje&s;ty, but for purpo&s;es of a private per&s;onal nature</P>
<P>Sect. 2.

<P>And upon the &s;ame principle and within the &s;ame equity of the &s;tatute, I think it was very rightly held by five of the judges, that a ri&s;ing of the weavers in and about London to de&s;troy all engine looms, a machine which enabled tho&s;e of the trade who made u&s;e of it to under&s;ell tho&s;e who had it not did not amount to levying war within the &s;tatute; though great outrages were committed on that occa&s;ion not only in London but in the adja|cent counties, and the magi&s;trates and peace officers were re&s;i&s;t|ed and affronted.</P>
<P>For tho&s;e judges con&s;idered the whole affair merely as a <HI>pri|vate

quarrel between men of the &s;ame trade about the u&s;e of a parti|cular engine, which tho&s;e concerned in the ri&s;ing thought detrimental to them.</HI> Five of the judges indeed were of a different opinion. But the attorney general thought proper to proceed again&s;t the defendents as for a riot only.</P>
<P>Sect. 3. But every in&s;urrection which in judgment of law is intended again&s;t the per&s;on of the king, be it to dethrone or impri&s;on him, or to oblige him to alter his mea&s;ures of govern|ment, or to remove evil coun&s;ellors from about him, the&s;e ri&s;|ings all amount to levying war within the &s;tatute; whether at|tended with the pomp a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d circum&s;tances of open war or no.

<P>Sect. 5. It was adjudged in the 16th Car. 1. a &s;ea&s;on of great agitation, that going to Lambeth hou&s;e in a warlike manner to &s;urpri&s;e the archbi&s;hop, who was a privy coun&s;ellor, it being <HI>with drums</HI> and a multitude to the number of 300, was trea&s;on.</P>
<P>This is a very imperfect account of an in&s;urrection, which hath found a place in the be&s;t hi&s;tories of that time. The tumult hap|pened on Monday the 11th of May 1640 about midnight. On Thur&s;|day following the &s;pecial commi&s;&s;ion under which the judges &s;at was opened and proceeded upon; and Ben&s;tead a ringleader in the tumult was convicted, and within a very few days afterwards executed.</P>
<P>It is not very ea&s;y from the &s;hort note of the ca&s;e given by the reporters, to collect the true grounds of this re&s;olution. But the
<PB N="48" REF="028332_0245_0FD8985C44654268">
hi&s;tory of the times will enable us to form a probable conjecture concerning them.</P>
<P>On the fifth of May the parliament was di&s;&s;olved to the gene|ral di&s;&s;atisfaction of the nation. And, which greatly increa&s;ed the ill humour of the people, the convocation was by a new commi&s;&s;ion impowered to continue &s;itting, notwith&s;tanding the di&s;&s;olution of the parliament. <HI>And the blame and odium of both the&s;e unpopular mea&s;ures were laid upon the archbi&s;hop.</HI></P>
<P>On Saturday the ninth of that month, a paper was pa&s;ted up at the Exchange, exhorting the apprentices to ri&s;e and &s;ack the archbi&s;hop's hou&s;e on the Monday <HI>following.</HI> And accordingly on that very day an attempt was made upon Lambeth hou&s;e by a rabble of &s;ome thou&s;ands; with open profe&s;&s;ion and prote&s;ta|tion, <HI>that they would tear the archbi&s;hop in pieces.</HI></P>
<P>It were to be wi&s;hed that the full import of the libel po&s;ted at the Exchange, in con&s;equence of which the attempt was made, had been <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">et out: and al&s;o that we were informed what was the cry among the rabble at the time of the attempt, more than that they would tear the archbi&s;hop in pieces. The&s;e circum&s;tances, could we come at them, would probably let us into the true rea|&s;on and motives for the ri&s;ing, and con&s;equently into the rea&s;on and grounds of the opinion of the judges. For if it did appear by the libel, or by the cry of the rabble at Lambeth hou&s;e, that the attempt was made on account of mea&s;ures <HI>the king had taken or was then taking at the in&s;tigation as they imagined of the archbi&s;hop;</HI> that the rabble had deliberately and upon a public invitation at|tempted <HI>by numbers and open force, to take a &s;evere revenge upon the privy-coun&s;ellor, for the mea&s;ures the &s;overeign had taken or was pur|&s;uing;</HI> if this may be &s;uppo&s;ed to be the ca&s;e, I think the &s;uppo|&s;ition is not very foreign, the grounds and rea&s;ons of the re&s;o|lution would in my opinion be &s;ufficiently explained, without taking that little trifling circum&s;tance of the drum into the ca&s;e. Upon &s;uch a &s;uppo&s;ition, the ca&s;e came within the rea&s;on of Tal|bot's ca&s;e, 17 R. 2, cited by Hale. And I think too within the rules laid down in the two preeeding &s;ections. But without the help of &s;ome &s;uch &s;uppo&s;ition, I &s;ee nothing in the ca&s;e as &s;tated by the report, which can amount to high trea&s;on.</P>
<P>Sect. 6. But a bare con&s;piracy for effecting a ri&s;ing, for the purpo&s;es mentioned in the two preceeding &s;ections and in the next, is not an overt act of compa&s;&s;ing the king's death. Nor will it come under any &s;pecies of trea&s;on within the 25 Edward 3. <HI>unle&s;s the ri&s;ing be effected.</HI> And in that ca&s;e the con&s;pirators as well as the actors will be all equally guilty. For in high trea|&s;on of all kinds, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the <HI>participes crimines</HI> are principals.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> that con&s;piracies for the&s;e purpo&s;es have been adjudged trea&s;on. But tho&s;e judgments were founded on

the temporary act of 13 Eliz. which made compa&s;&s;ing to levy war, declared by printing, writing, or advi&s;ed &s;peaking, high trea&s;on <HI>during the life of the queen.</HI></P>
<P>There was an act in the 13 Car. 2. to the &s;ame purpo&s;e on which &s;ome pro&s;ecutions were founded; but that act expired with the death of the king.</P>

<P>The indictments charged that the pri&s;oners withdrawing their allegiance &amp;c. and con&s;piring and intending to di&s;turb the peace and public tranquillity of the kingdom, did traiterou&s;ly compa&s;s, imagine, and intend to levy and rai&s;e war, rebellion, and in&s;ur|rection again&s;t the queen within the kingdom; and that in or|der to complete and effect tho&s;e their traiterous intentions and imaginations, they on the  <GAP DESC="blank">  day of  <GAP DESC="blank">  at  <GAP DESC="blank">  with a multitude of people to the number of 500 armed and arrayed in a warlike manner &amp;c. then and there traiterou&s;ly a&s;&s;embled, did traiterou&s;ly ordain, prepare, and levy war again&s;t the queen, again&s;t the duty of their allegiance &amp;c.</P>
<P>It appeared upon the trial of the&s;e men, which I attended in the &s;tudents gallery at the Old Bailey, that upon the 1&s;t March 1709, during Dr. Sacheverell's trial, the rabble who had at|tended the doctor from We&s;tmin&s;ter to his lodgings in the tem|ple, continued together a &s;hort &s;pace in the King's Bench walks, crying among other cries of the day, <HI>down with the Pre&s;byterians.</HI></P>
<P>At length it was propo&s;ed, by whom it was not known, to pull down the meeting hou&s;es, and thereupon the cry became general, <HI>down with the meeting hou&s;es:</HI> and &s;ome thou&s;ands imme|diately moved toward a meeting hou&s;e of Mr. Burges, a Prote&s;|tant di&s;&s;enting mini&s;ter; the defendant Damaree, a waterman in the queen's &s;ervice, and in her livery and badge, putting him&s;elf at the head of them, and crying, <HI>come on boys, I'll lead you, down with the meeting hou&s;es.</HI> They &s;oon demoli&s;hed Mr. Burges's, and burnt the pews, pulpit, and other materials in Lincoln's Inn Fields. After they had fini&s;hed at that place, they agreed to proceed to the <HI>re&s;t of the meeting hou&s;es.</HI> And hearing that the guards were coming to di&s;per&s;e them, they agreed for <HI>the greater di&s;patch to divide into &s;everal bodies, and to attack different hou&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s at the &s;ame time.</HI> And many were that night in part de|moli&s;hed, and the material<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> burnt in the &s;treet.</P>
<P>The pri&s;oner Damaree put him&s;elf at the head of a party which drew off from Lincoln's-Inn fields and demoli&s;hed a meet|ing
<PB N="50" REF="028332_0247_0FD8985EFA2A3A70">
hou&s;e in Drury-Lane, and burnt the materials in the &s;treet; &s;till crying they would pull them <HI>all down that night.</HI></P>
<P>While the materials of this hou&s;e were burning, the pri&s;oner Purcha&s;e who had not, for aught appeared, been before concerned in the outrages of that night, came up to the fire very drunk; and with his drawn &s;word in his hand, encouraged the rabble in what they were doing And incited them to re&s;i&s;t the guards who were ju&s;t then come to the fire in order to di&s;per&s;e the multi|tude. He likewi&s;e a&s;&s;aulted the commanding officer with his drawn &s;word, and &s;truck &s;everal of their hor&s;es with the &s;ame weapon And then advancing towards the guards, cried ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to the rabble behind him, <HI>come on boys, I'll lo&s;e my life in the cau&s;e, I will fight the be&s;t of them.</HI></P>
<P>Upon the trial of Damaree the ca&s;es referred to before in Sect. 4. and 5. were cited at the bar, and all the judges pre&s;ent were of opinion that the pri&s;oner was guilty of the high trea&s;on charged upon him in the indictment. For here was a ri&s;ing with an avowed intention to demoli&s;h <HI>all meeting hou&s;es in general;</HI> and this intent they carried into execution as far as they were able&punc; If the meeting hou&s;es of Prote&s;tant Di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">enters had been erected and &s;upported in defiance of all law, a ri&s;ing in order to de&s;troy &s;uch hou&s;es <HI>in general,</HI> would have fallen under the rule laid down in Keiling with regard to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">emoli&s;hing <HI>all</HI> bawdy hou&s;es. But &s;ince the meeting hou&s;es of Prote&s;tant Di&s;&s;enters are by the toleration act taken under the protection of the law, the in&s;urrection in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e was to be con&s;idered as a public declaration by the rabble again&s;t that act, and an attempt to render it ineffectual by <HI>numbers and open force.</HI></P>
<P>Accordingly Damaree was found guilty, and had judgment of death as in ca&s;es of high trea&s;on.</P>
<P>But he was pardoned and &s;oon after re&s;tored to his badge and livery, which he wore to the death of the queen Her maje&s;ty's new advi&s;ers did not choo&s;e to have the dawn of their admini|&s;tration &s;tained with the blood of one of Dr. Sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hervell's <HI>able&s;t</HI> advocates.</P>
<P>With regard to the ca&s;e of Purcha&s;e, there was &s;ome diver|&s;ity of opinion among the judges pre&s;ent at his trial: becau&s;e it did not appear upon the evidence, that he had any concern in the o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">iginal ri&s;ing, or was pre&s;ent at the pulling down any of the hou&s;es, or any ways active in the outrages of that night; except his behaviour at the bonfire in Drury <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ane, whither he came by mere accident, for aught appeared to the contrary.</P>
<P>The jury therefore by the direction of the court found a &s;pe|cial verdict to the effect already mentioned.</P>
<P>Upon this &s;p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ial verdict, which in &s;ub&s;tance took in the whole tran&s;action on the fir&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h, the judges unanimou&s;ly
<PB N="51" REF="028332_0248_0FD8986168898488">
re&s;olved, that for the rea&s;ons mentioned at Damaree's trial, he and the others concerned with him in the demoli&s;hing and rifl|ing the meeting hou&s;es, were guilty of high trea&s;on in levying war again&s;t the queen.</P>
<P>As to the ca&s;e of Purcha&s;e, chief ju&s;tice Trevor, ju&s;tice Powel, and baron Price were of opinion, that upon the facts found, he was not guilty of the charge in the indictment. But all the re&s;t of the judges differed from them. Becau&s;e the rabble was trai|terou&s;ly a&s;&s;embled, and in the very act of levying war when Pur|cha&s;e joined them, and encouraged them to proceed, and a&s;&s;ault|ed the guards, who were &s;ent to &s;uppre&s;s them. All this being done in defence and &s;upport of per&s;ons engaged <HI>in the very act of rebellion,</HI> involved him in the guilt of that trea&s;on in which the others were engaged.</P>
<P>This man likewi&s;e was pardoned. His ca&s;e in point of law and of real guilt too, came far &s;hort of Damaree's.</P>
<P>Sect. 8 The joining with rebels in an act of rebellion, or with enemies in acts of ho&s;tility, will make a man a traitor: in the one ca&s;e within the clau&s;e of levying war, in the other within that of adhering to the king's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">emies. But if this be done for fear of death, and while the party is under actual force, and he taketh the fir&s;t opportunity that offereth to make his e&s;cape, this fear of compul&s;ion will excu&s;e him. It is however incumbent on the party who maketh fear and compul&s;ion his defence, to &s;hew to the &s;atisfaction of the court and jury, that the compul|&s;ion continued during all the time he &s;taid with the rebels or enemies.</P>
<P>I will not &s;ay that he is obliged to account for every day, week, or month. That perhaps would be impo&s;&s;ible. And therefore if an original force be proved, and the pri&s;oner can &s;hew, that he in earne&s;t attempted to e&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ape and was prevented; or that he did get off and was forced ba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">k, or that he was nar|rowly watched, and all pa&s;&s;es guarded; or from other circum|&s;tances; which it is impo&s;&s;ible to &s;tate with preci&s;ion, but when proved ought to weigh with a jury&punc; that an attempt to e&s;cape would have been attended with great difficulty and danger; <HI>&s;o that upon the whole he may be pre&s;umed to have continued among&s;t them again&s;t his will, though not con&s;tantly under an actual force or fear of immediate death,</HI> the&s;e circum&s;tances and others of the like ten|dency proved to the &s;atisfaction of the court and jury, will be &s;ufficient to excu&s;e him.</P>
<P>But an apprehen&s;ion though ever &s;o well grounded, of having hou&s;es burnt or e&s;tates wa&s;ted or cattle de&s;troyed, or of any other mi&s;chief of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he like kind, will not excu&s;e in the ca&s;e of joining and marching with rebels or enemies.</P>
<P>Furni&s;hing rebels or enemies with money, arms, ammunition,

or othe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> nece&s;&s;aries will <HI>prima facie,</HI> make a man a traitor. But if enemies or rebels come with a &s;uperior force and exact contri|butions, or live upon the country at free quarter, &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion in the&s;e ca&s;es is not criminal. For <HI>flagrante bello</HI> the <HI>jus b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lli</HI> taketh place, 'tis the only law then &s;ub&s;i&s;ting. And &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion is a point of the highe&s;t prudence to prevent a greater public evil.</P>
<P>And the bare &s;ending money or provi&s;ions (except in the ca&s;e ju&s;t excepted) or &s;ending intelligence to rebels or enemies, which in mo&s;t ca&s;es is the mo&s;t effectual aid that can be given them, will make a man a traitor, though the money or intelli|gence &s;hould happen to be intercepted. For the party in &s;end|ing did all he could; the trea&s;on was complete <HI>on his part, though it had not the effect he intended</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">So ruled in the ca&s;e of William Greg, and in the ca&s;e of Dr. Hen&s;ey.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The ca&s;es cited in the margin did not in truth turn &s;ingly up|on the rule here laid down, though I think the rule may be very well &s;upported. For Greg was indicted for <HI>compa&s;&s;ing the death</HI> of the queen, and al&s;o <HI>for adhering to her enemies</HI>; and Hen&s;ey's indictment was in the &s;ame form, and &s;o was lord Pre&s;ton's cit|ed in the la&s;t chapter. And the writing and &s;ending the letters of intelligence, which in the ca&s;es of Greg and Hen&s;ey <HI>were &s;topped at the po&s;t office,</HI> was laid as an overt act of both the &s;pecies of trea&s;on. So that admitting for argument's &s;ake, which is by no means admitted, that it was not an overt act of <HI>adhering,</HI> &s;ince the letters never came to the enemies hands, and con&s;e|quently no <HI>aid o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> comfort</HI> was actually given, yet the bare writ|ing and &s;ending them to the po&s;t office in order to be delivered to the enemy, was undoubtedly an overt act of the other &s;pecies of trea&s;on. In Greg's ca&s;e the judges did re&s;olve that it was an overt act of both the &s;pecies of trea&s;on charged on him. And in Hen&s;ey's the court adopted that opinion, and cited it with approbation.</P>
<P>Though the ca&s;es of the&s;e men were in &s;ub&s;tance the &s;ame, the charge again&s;t them varied in one particular. Greg's indictment chargeth that the letters were &s;ent from the place where the <HI>venue</HI> is laid <HI>into</HI> parts beyond the &s;eas (IN <HI>partes tran&s;marinas</HI>) to be delivered to the enemy. Hen&s;ey's, with much greater pro|priety, and agreeable to the truth of the ca&s;e, chargeth that the letters were &s;ent from the place where the <HI>venue</HI> is laid, <HI>to be de|livered in</HI> parts beyond the &s;eas to the enemy. As the letters never went abroad, this was undoubtedly the &s;afer way of lay|ing the charge.</P>
<P>Sect. 9. An a&s;&s;embly armed and arrayed in a warlike manner for any trea&s;onable purpo&s;e is <HI>bellum levatum,</HI> though not <HI>bellum percu&s;&s;um.</HI> Li&s;ting and marching are &s;ufficient overt acts with|out
<PB N="53" REF="028332_0250_0FD898680DE89F88">
coming to a battle or action. So crui&s;ing on the king's &s;ub|jects under a French commi&s;&s;ion, France being then at war with us, was held to be adhering to the king's enemies, though no other act of ho&s;tility was laid or proved.</P>
<P>Sect. 10. Attacking the king's forces <HI>in oppo&s;ition to his authority</HI> upon a march or in quarters, is levying war again&s;t the king. But if upon a &s;udden quarrel, from &s;ome affront given or taken, the neighbourhood &s;hould ri&s;e and drive the forces out of their quarters, that would be a great mi&s;demeanor, and if death &s;hould en&s;ue, it may be felony in the a&s;&s;ailants: But it will not be trea&s;on, becau&s;e there was no intention again&s;t the king's per&s;on or government.</P>
<P>Sect. 11. Holding a ca&s;tle or fort again&s;t the king or his forc|es, if <HI>actual force be u&s;ed in order to keep po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion,</HI> is levying war. But a bare detainer, as &s;uppo&s;e by &s;hutting the gates again&s;t the king or his forces, without any other force from within, Lord Hale conceiveth will not amount to trea&s;on. But if this be done in <HI>confederacy with enemies</HI> or rebels, that circum&s;tance will make it trea&s;on; in the one ca&s;e under the clau&s;e of adhering to the king's enemies, in the other under that of levying war. So if a per&s;on having the cu&s;tody of a ca&s;tle or fort deliver it up to the rebels or enemies, <HI>by treachery and in combination with them,</HI> this is high trea&s;on within the act: in the former ca&s;e 'tis levy|ing war, in the latter it is adhering to the king's enemies. But mere cowardice or imprudence, though it might &s;ubject a com|mander in &s;uch ca&s;e to death by the martial law, will not a|mount to trea&s;on.</P>
<P>Sect. 12. States in actual ho&s;tility with us, though no war be &s;olemnly declared, are enemies within the meaning of the act. And therefore in an indictment on the clau&s;e of adhering to the king's enemies, it is &s;ufficient to aver that the prince or &s;tate adhered to <HI>is an enemy,</HI> without &s;howing any war proclaimed. And the fact, whether war or no, is triable by the jury; and public notoriety, is &s;ufficient evidence of the fact. And if the &s;ubject of a foreign prince in amity with us, invadeth the king|dom without commi&s;&s;ion from his &s;overeign, he is an enemy. And a &s;ubject of England adhering to him is a traitor, within this clau&s;e of the act. Or if an alien <HI>amy</HI> acteth in a ho&s;tile manner again&s;t us under a commi&s;&s;ion from a prince or &s;tate at enmity with us, he is an enemy within the act. And adhering to him is trea&s;on within this clau&s;e.</P>
<P>So if a &s;ubject of England maketh actual war on the king's al|lies engaged with him again&s;t the common enemy, as was the ca&s;e of the States General in our wars again&s;t France in the time of king William and the late queen, this is adhering to the king's enemies, though no act of ho&s;tility is committed again&s;t
<PB N="54" REF="028332_0251_0FD8986AF41BA920">
the king or his forces. For by this the common enemy is &s;trengthened, and the king's hands are weakened.</P>
<P>Sect. 13. In pro&s;ecution for the&s;e trea&s;ons, as well as for that of comparing the death of the king, an overt act of the trea&s;on mu&s;t, as I have already ob&s;erved, be charged in the indictment and proved. This rule is grounded on the words of the &s;tatute, which being a declaratory act mu&s;t &s;trictly be pur&s;ued. The words to this purpo&s;e are,
<Q>Where a man doth compa&s;s, &amp;c.&mdash; or if a man doth levy war again&s;t our lord the king in his realm, or be adherent to the kfng's enemies in his realm, giv|ing them aid or comfort in his realm or el&s;ewhere, and there|of be [<HI>provablement,</HI> i. e. upon full proof] attainted of <HI>open</HI> deed.</Q>
And therefore it will not be &s;ufficient to alledge ge|nerally that the defendents did levy war or adhere. But in the former ca&s;e it mu&s;t be alledged that they did a&s;&s;emble with a multitude armed and arrayed in a warlike manner, and levied war. And in the latter, acts of adherence mu&s;t be &s;et forth.</P>
<P>But the particular facts done by the defendants, or a detail of the evidence intended to be given, need not be &s;et forth in ei|ther ca&s;e. The common law, as I have already &s;aid upon a like occa&s;ion, never required this exactne&s;s: and the &s;tatute of king William doth not make it nece&s;&s;ary to charge particular facts, where it was not nece&s;&s;ary before."</P>
<P>The que&s;tion will now occur, Are we bound by the&s;e deci|&s;ions, founded in con&s;tructions given to the clau&s;e of "levy|ing war?" The deci&s;ions of the judges are only evidence of law, not the law it&s;elf. Where the deci&s;ion is unrea&s;onable, it cannot be the law. There is a higher evidence again&s;t it, than the opinion in its favour; viz. the general rea&s;on of the human mind. Yet deci&s;ions ought to be regarded, as the judgments of wi&s;e men, <HI>re&s;pon&s;a prudentum,</HI> and in &s;ome ca&s;es, to be fol|lowed as undeviatingly as the law it&s;elf. For in&s;tance, where under a deci&s;ion, that has taken place, a principle has been &s;et|tled in the tenure of e&s;tates, by grant, devi&s;e, or in per&s;onal contracts, which mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed in view, at the time of the grant, devi&s;e, or contract. It would operate with an effect, <HI>ex po&s;t facto,</HI> to depart from the deci&s;ion. Nothing of this can exi&s;t in the ca&s;e of a deci&s;ion on the criminal code, where it is in favour of the accu&s;ed. The court is, <HI>quo ad hoc</HI> the govern|ment, and a rigorous con&s;truction does not bind. It may re|lax. But a liberal con&s;truction given, concludes again&s;t a more rigorous one in future ca&s;es. Becau&s;e every per&s;on is &s;uppo&s;|ed
<PB N="55" REF="028332_0252_0FD8856267578880">
to know the deci&s;ion, and to be told that in the cognizance of offences, hitherto the law will go, and no further.</P>
<P>Are we then at liberty to depart from the con&s;tructions giv|en by the Engli&s;h judges to the clau&s;e of "levying war?" I have no doubt of it, nay think that pur&s;uing the meliorating &s;pirit of the con&s;titution, and of our legi&s;lature, we are bound to depart from them in all ca&s;es, warranted by rea&s;on.</P>
<P>Are there any ca&s;es where the deci&s;ions appear unrea&s;onable? There are.</P>
<P>In order illu&s;trate this, I fir&s;t ob&s;erve that a "war levied" is of two &s;orts, 1&s;t. Expre&s;sly and directly, as rai&s;ing war again&s;t the king, or his general and forces; or to &s;urprize and injure the king's per&s;on, or to impri&s;on him, or to go to his pre&s;ence to enforce him to remove any of his mini&s;ters or coun&s;ellers, and the like. 2d. Interpretatively and con&s;tructively, as when a war is levied to throw down enclo&s;ures generally, or to en|hance &s;ervants wages, or to alter religion e&s;tabli&s;hed by law, and many in&s;tances of like nature might be given. This has been re&s;olved to be a war again&s;t the king, and trea&s;on within this clau&s;e <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Hale. 137</NOTE>. The fir&s;t re&s;olution, &s;ays Sir Mathew Hale, that I find of this interpretative levying war, is a re&s;olution cited by my lord Coke, in the time of Henry VIII, for enhancing &s;er|vants wages; and the next in time was that of Burton, 39 E|lizabeth, for rai&s;ing an armed force to pull down enclo&s;ures generally. This is now &s;ettled by the&s;e in&s;tances, and &s;ome of the like kind hereafter mentioned. The preceeding again&s;t Bur|ton and his companions, was not upon the &s;tatute of 25 Ed|ward III, which required that in new ca&s;es, the Parliament &s;hould be fir&s;t con&s;ulted; but upon the &s;tatute of 13 Elizabeth; for con&s;piring to levy war, which has not that clau&s;e of con&s;ult|ing the parliament in new ca&s;es, and therefore &s;eems to leave a latitude to the judges, to make con&s;tructions greater than was left by the &s;tatute or 25 Edward III.</P>
<P>The&s;e re&s;olutions being made and &s;ettled, we mu&s;t acquie&s;ce in them, <HI>but in my opinion, if new ca&s;es happen for the future,</HI> that have not an expre&s;s re&s;olution in point, nor are expre&s;ly within the words of 25 Edward III, though they may &s;eem to have a parity of rea&s;on, it is the &s;afe&s;t way, and mo&s;t agreeable to the wi&s;dom of the great act of 25 Edward III, fir&s;t to con|&s;ult the Parliament, and have their declaration, and to be very wary in multiplying con&s;tructive and interpretative trea&s;ons; for we know not where we will end <NOTE PLACE="foot">Hale. 13<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></NOTE>.</P>

<P>There was a &s;pecial verdict found at the Old Bailey, 20 Car. 11.

And 3d, Becau&s;e the &s;tatute of 1 Mary, chap|ter 12; though now di&s;continued, makes a&s;&s;emblies of above 12 per&s;ons, and of as high a nature, only felony, and that not with|out a continuance together an hour after proclamation made; as namely, an a&s;&s;embly to pull down bawdy hou&s;es, burn mills, or to abate the rent of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ny manors, lands, or tenements, or the price of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ctuals, or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Yet the greater opinion obtained as was fit, &s;ays the author, and the&s;e apprentices him judgment, and &s;ome of them were executed as for high trea&s;on.</P>

The five judges who were for making it trea&s;on had relied on Bur|ton's ca&s;e. The deci&s;ion in that of the bawdy hou&s;es, did not then exi&s;t; it was five years after.</P>
<P>I conceive the que&s;tion fairly open for di&s;cu&s;&s;ion; what ought to be the con&s;truction of the clau&s;e of "levying war." I mean taking up the &s;ubject, as certainly we have a right to do, un&s;hackled by the deci&s;ions of the Engli&s;h judges.</P>
<P>Taking up the &s;ubject on fir&s;t principles, it might be &s;aid, that even a &s;imple tre&s;pa&s;s tends to the &s;ubver&s;ion of the government; and every breach of the peace is &s;aid to be again&s;t the peace and dignity of the commonwealth. But where the tre&s;pa&s;s is with numbers, and with arms, it is arrayed more formally again&s;t the order of &s;ociety, and might be con&s;trued trea&s;on. It was with a view to &s;uch con&s;truction that the &s;tatute of 25 Edward III, provides that "if any man ride armed openly, or &s;ecretly with men of arms, again&s;t any other, to &s;lay or to rob him, till he made fine for his deliverance, it is not the mind of the king, nor his council, that in &s;uch a ca&s;e it &s;hall be judged trea&s;on; but it &s;hall be judges felony or tre&s;pa&s;s according to the law of the land, of old time u&s;ed, and accord|ing as the ca&s;e requireth."</P>
<P>It was on this principle the boundary of con&s;truction was &s;et|tled by the judges generally; that, "ri&s;ings to maintain a private claim of right, or to de&s;troy <HI>particular</HI> inclo&s;ures; or or to remove nui&s;ances, which affect, or were thought to affect <HI>in point of intere&s;t the parties a&s;&s;embled</HI> for tho&s;e purpo&s;es, or to break pri&s;ons in order to relea&s;e <HI>particular</HI> per&s;ons, without any other circum&s;tance of aggravation, have not been holden to a|mount to levying war, within the &s;tatute."</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be therefore an in&s;urrection which in judgment of law is intended again&s;t the government, to overthrow it; as you would break a machine to pieces, or to &s;top the motion of it, by breaking or ob&s;tructing &s;ome wheel or &s;pring that is ne|ce&s;&s;ary for its operation. Yet re&s;i&s;tance to an officer in the ex|ecution of his proce&s;s, by the law of the land, is but an aggra|vated tre&s;pa&s;s. With a view to &s;uch con&s;truction, our &s;tatute has provided, "that if any per&s;on &s;hall knowingly and wilfully ob&s;truct, re&s;i&s;t, or oppo&s;e any officer of the United States, in &s;erving or attempting to &s;erve, or execute an me&s;ne proce&s;s, or warrant, or order of any of the courts of the United States, or any other legal or judicial writ, or proce&s;s what&s;oever, or

&s;hall a&s;&s;ault, beat, or wound any officer, or other per&s;on duly authori&s;ed, in &s;erving or executing any writ, rule, order, pro|ce&s;s, or warrant afore&s;aid, every per&s;on &s;o knowingly and wil|fully offending in the premi&s;es, &s;hall, on conviction thereof, be impri&s;oned not exceeding twelve months, and fined not exceed|ing three hundred dollars <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Laws of the United States</NOTE>."</P>
<P>I would in the fir&s;t place lay a&s;ide con&s;tructive trea&s;ons alto|gether, and confine the law to a direct attack upon the govern|ment, and in the &s;econd place I would confine it to an attack, <HI>animo &s;ubvertendi.</HI> Will it not be ea&s;y then to meditate the o|verthrowing the government, and go on to execute it by a re|&s;i&s;tance to a law, and by ri&s;ings for indirect purpo&s;es, without a po&s;&s;ibility of making proof of an <HI>animus &s;ubvertendi,</HI> or con|&s;piracy to overthrow? Let it be left to the jury to pre&s;ume, or infer from the acts them&s;elves, what the intention was; but let it always be in view as the e&s;&s;ence of the act, that there was a directly looking forward in the mind of the per&s;on, to a &s;ub|ver&s;ion of the government, before it be con&s;trued trea&s;on. E|very outrage, without this e&s;&s;ential expedent may be repre&s;&s;ed, and puni&s;hed under the idea of a riot, &s;ubjecting to fine, pillo|ry, impri&s;onment, and hard labour. This will be more agree|able to the common &s;en&s;e and feelings of mankind, who mu&s;t be &s;truck with a &s;en&s;e that the outrage is a riot, but to whom it cannot be obvious, that it was meditated as an attempt upon the government it&s;elf, amounting to high trea&s;on. It is only by deduction and inference, that it becomes &s;o.</P>
<P>There will be no evidence, that any of tho&s;e concerned in the attack of the hou&s;e of the in&s;pector of the revenue, general Ne|ville, ever thought of &s;ubverting the government, or had an i|dea that the act would be con&s;trued trea&s;on. Whatever the ulti|mate views of the&s;e may have been, who projected the taking the magazine at Pitt&s;burgh, certain it is, that the bulk had no looking forward of mind to more than a redre&s;s of what they called grievances, under the government. If the con&s;truction therefore for which I have contended, is &s;upportable, either of the&s;e acts will amount to a riot only.</P>
<P>It will be &s;aid that our legi&s;lature, in excerpting the very words of the clau&s;e from the &s;tatute 25 Edward III, mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed at the time to have had an eye to the con&s;truction given to this clau&s;e by the deci&s;ions of the Engli&s;h courts; and by adop|ting the terms, has &s;anctioned the interpretation.

This being the ca&s;e, it is contrary to the law maxims of humanity, to e&s;tabli&s;h the pre&s;umption. The legi&s;lature intent upon re|&s;training the trea&s;on law to a &s;ingle clau&s;e, may not at the &s;ame time, have pur&s;ued the con&s;tructions of that clau&s;e in their minds. It is not probable they did. It was not nece&s;&s;ary. The judges had the power to con&s;true the&s;e words, on principle of rea&s;on, with the &s;ame licence as if they never had been in a trea&s;on table of England. The ultimate que&s;tion then will be, whether it be nece&s;&s;ary for the pre&s;ervation of the government, that the trea&s;on law be carried &s;o for as to make the circum&s;tances in the ca&s;e of Neville's hou&s;e, or the march to Braddock's fields, amount to that offence.</P>
<P>I admit that by the deci&s;ion of the Engli&s;h judges, the attack upon the hou&s;e of the in&s;pector, is clearly trea&s;on. For though it was not de&s;troying <HI>all</HI> in&s;pection offices, yet it was for <HI>a purpo&s;e of a public nature, and in which the in&s;urgents had no &s;pecial or in|dividual intere&s;t</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Fo&s;ter. 2.1.</NOTE>, exclu&s;ively of the community.</P>
<P>I al&s;o mu&s;t admit that the march to Braddock's field, by the &s;ame con&s;truction, mu&s;t be trea&s;on; for though the expelling individuals would be but a violent tre&s;pa&s;s in it&s;elf; yet connected, as it was, with a view to the operation of a law which the&s;e men were &s;uppo&s;ed to countenance and &s;upport, it will be brought to the &s;ame thing. But the que&s;tion may be made, whether it be ne|ce&s;&s;ary for the pre&s;ervation of the government, that the&s;e or like ca&s;es be adjudged trea&s;on, where no evidence is alledged of an avowed intention to bring about a revolution.</P>
<P>Elementary writers, at the head of whom is the marquis de Beccaria, have with great plau&s;ibility, que&s;tioned the right of &s;ociety to puni&s;h, by taking life at all. They &s;tand on &s;urer ground, who que&s;tion only the nece&s;&s;ity. By the Ru&s;&s;ian code, and that of Tu&s;cany, it has been reduced to an experiment; and capital puni&s;hment is found not nece&s;&s;ary. The only u&s;e of this at pre&s;ent, is to enforce a leaning of the mind towards a con&s;truction of the law, that will re&s;train it to the highe&s;t &s;pe|cies of trea&s;on, and what alone ought to bear the name; a con|&s;piracy to overthrow the government.</P>
<P>As our trea&s;on law &s;tands, it is more the intere&s;t of the gov|ernment in point of reparation from the offender, to have the
<PB N="60" REF="028332_0257_0FD8987670AA09D0">
act con&s;idered in the light of an aggravated riot only, than to have it made trea&s;on; in which ca&s;e there is no forfeiture of pro|perty <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"No condition or judgment, for any of the offences afore&s;aid, &s;hall work corruption of blood, or any forfeiture of e&s;tate."
<BIBL>Laws of United States, 151.</BIBL></NOTE>. Rea&s;ons of policy would therefore lead to that con|&s;truction of the clau&s;e, for which I have contended.</P>
<P>Nothing can be right that is contrary to the feelings of the human heart, and at that which the rea&s;on of the common mind revolts. Let it be told one of the&s;e accu&s;ed, that the e&s;&s;ence of the charge again&s;t him is an attempt to &s;hake the foundations of the government to which he had &s;worn allegiance, and to o|verturn, as far as in him lay, the exi&s;ting order of &s;ociety, with all the advantages of &s;ecurity to per&s;on, property, and fame; and to bring about anarchy at fir&s;t, and tyranny of one or a few in the end. He would &s;ay, I never had &s;uch a thought. O|thers will believe him; and they cannot feel an acquie&s;cence with the law that would by con&s;truction fix this de&s;ign upon him.</P>
<P>In every other crime, it is known and contemplated to the extent, what the individual is about to perpetrate. In homi|cide, he knows he is about to kill a man; in burglary, to break a hou&s;e; in larceny, to &s;teal an article. The fact in its nature and con&s;equences exi&s;ts clearly to his mind. He is under no nece&s;&s;ity of con&s;truing and inferring, in order to know what he is about. It is the <HI>quo animo,</HI> the mind with which a thing is done, that is all at all times to be con&s;idered. And if it cannot be found that the mind meant the act, it cannot be con&s;idered as the act of the mind, which is the man.</P>
<P>I would therefore under&s;tand our law, as having in view on|ly a fixed, formed, deliberate intention of &s;ubverting the gov|ernment, as that offence which it will con&s;true high trea&s;on, and puni&s;h with the lo&s;s of life it&s;elf. The accu&s;ed h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d medi|tated death to the government, and the law in this ca&s;e, and this ca&s;e only, will meditate death to him.</P>
<P>The legi&s;lature of the United States contemplating preci&s;ely &s;uch a ca&s;e as that of the in&s;urrection of the we&s;tern country, has provided for the &s;uppre&s;&s;ing it by an act of May 2d, 1790. "Whenever the laws of the United States, &s;hall be oppo&s;ed, or the execution thereof ob&s;tructed in any &s;tate, by combinations too powerful to be &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, by the ordinary cour&s;e of judiciary

And if the militia where &s;uch combi|nations may happen, &s;hall refu&s;e, or be in&s;ufficient to &s;uppre&s;s the &s;ame, it &s;hall be lawful for the Pre&s;ident, if the legi&s;lature of the United States be not in &s;e&s;&s;ion, to call forth and employ &s;uch numbers of the militia of any other &s;tate or &s;tates, mo&s;t convenient thereto as may be nece&s;&s;ary, until the expiration of thirty days, after commencement of the en&s;uing &s;e&s;&s;ion." The "oppo&s;ing the laws, or ob&s;tructing the execution," are the phra&s;es; not that of traiterou&s;ly con&s;piring to &s;ubvert the gov|ernment. So that it would &s;eem to have had in view, an in|&s;urrection for a purpo&s;e of an inferior nature, and calls it, "an unlawful combination," which though tending in its con&s;equence to overthrow the government, yet had not that for its object in the contemplation of the actors. We are relieved, therefore, by this act, from an objection which might exi&s;t, that unle&s;s &s;uch outrages as the&s;e were con&s;trued trea&s;on, the power of the federal government could not move to &s;uppre&s;s them. On the ground, therefore, of the pre&s;ervation of the union, I &s;ee no nece&s;&s;ity to carry our con&s;truction of the clau&s;e of "levying war," &s;o far as to embrace the late acts in the we&s;tern country within the crime of trea&s;on.</P>
<P>If, in any ca&s;e, proof can be directly made, or if the jury, from the facts them&s;elves, cannot but pre&s;ume that a &s;ubver&s;ion was intended, it may be &s;o con&s;trued, but not otherwi&s;e.</P>

<HEAD>On the <HI>Expediency</HI> of <HI>Pardoning</HI> in the pre&s;ent In&s;tance.</HEAD>
<P>I HAVE heard of a brother of the bar, who was of the militia that marched to &s;uppre&s;s the in&s;urrection, and though not actually borne upon men's &s;houlders in a palanquin, in the manner of the A&s;iatics, yet was conducted with &s;uch &s;oftne&s;s in the me&s;s of a commanding officer, as to render it impo&s;&s;ible to have &s;u&s;tained any great fatigue, or to have &s;uffered much from the campaign; yet is &s;aid to have expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf with pa&s;&s;ion, on hearing, that in all probability, none of the pri&s;on|ers would &s;uffer death. "What!" &s;aid he, "after all that I have &s;uffered, none of them be hanged!" He had &s;uffered little el&s;e, but the plea&s;ure of a ride, in good company on the road, yet expre&s;&s;ed chagrin at the pro&s;pect of not having &s;ome hang|ed. I may be &s;aid to have &s;uffered a good deal, and to have a better ground of re&s;entment again&s;t tho&s;e who were the imme|diate cau&s;e of it; yet I have never wi&s;hed any of them hang|ed. My expre&s;s object in the&s;e ob&s;ervations is to prevent it. Who has a better right to &s;peak? I have been a &s;uppre&s;&s;er of the in&s;urrection. None of tho&s;e who marched to fight, or were here to council, in their individual capacity, have done more.</P>
<P>I admit that of all who felt pain, the Pre&s;ident of the United States, mu&s;t have felt mo&s;t. He &s;aw the glory of his acquire|ments at &s;take; for &s;hake the foundation of the government, and where were the honours of having rai&s;ed the fabric? To what u&s;e had his toils been applied? The labours and watch|ings of years, were about to peri&s;h under his own admini&s;tra|tion. I figured to my&s;elf often his &s;olicitude, and could enter into his feelings fully. His pain mu&s;t have been exqui&s;ite. Yet I will venture to &s;ay, he had no ab&s;tract wi&s;h that any of them &s;hould be hanged; nor has he any wi&s;h now. The on|ly que&s;tion will be, How &s;hall it be avoided?</P>
<P>The Pre&s;ident by the con&s;titution, has the power "to grant reprieves, and pardons, for offences again&s;t the United States." This &s;uppo&s;es ca&s;es, in which it will be his duty to grant re|prieves

or pardons. Let us examine if the late in&s;urrection be one. It will be con&s;idered, that it was difficult for the common mind of this country, to di&s;tingui&s;h an attack upon the officers, appointed to carry a law, odious to them, into execution, from that oppo&s;ition which the officers under the &s;tamp act of Great-Britain had received, at a more early period. They could &s;ee no difference in the ca&s;e of John Neville, and Zachariah Hood <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Stamp ma&s;ter-general.</NOTE>. The law was &s;aid to be grievous in both ca&s;es; and that was all they knew about it. In the ca&s;e of the tea duty al&s;o, an oppo&s;ition by force, took place, which is celebrated to this day, among&s;t the fir&s;t acts of patrioti&s;m. Could you expect an accu|rate conception of the di&s;tinction which exi&s;ts; tho&s;e acts being again&s;t laws that were void, becau&s;e they were uncon&s;titution|al; and the&s;e being again&s;t a law, which though unequal, is con&s;titutional? It a&s;toni&s;hes them to this hour, why the authors of our revolution from Great Britain, &s;hould be celebrated, and yet talk of hanging the&s;e that were doing nothing more than oppo&s;ing what was wrong, among&s;t our&s;elves. I know, to u&s;e the expre&s;&s;ion of one or them, "they thought that in taking up arms to oppo&s;e the exci&s;e laws, they were doing God's &s;er|vice." The language of humanity, then would be, "forgive them, for they knew not what they did." It is a hard ca&s;e to puni&s;h where the mind is not criminal. The gradual improve|ment of education by public &s;chools, may inform the ma&s;s of the people, and correct a mi&s;take of principles. The example of the people of France, ru&s;hing to extremes, and the&s;e being the &s;ubject of the elogium of the day, have mi&s;led the common people here, and forms in the mind of a reflecting per&s;on, a palliation of their exce&s;&s;es. They have &s;een things in a ma&s;s, and have not developed principles.</P>

<P>The long e&s;tabli&s;hed prejudices of the country again&s;t the ex|ci&s;e law, forms a mitigation in the moral nature of the acts of individuals in oppo&s;ition to it. By the contagion of opinion and example, it was thought to be virtue. The outrage were the offspring more of common mi&s;under&s;tanding, than of particular vice.

It would an&s;wer the &s;ame end to hang an unfle&s;hed &s;keleton, and call it Tom the Tinker.</P>
<P>Taking into view what has been &s;aid on the con&s;truction of the clau&s;e of "levying war," it would &s;eem that &s;hould the judges conceive them&s;elves bound on principle of precedent, or rea&s;on by e&s;tabli&s;hed con&s;truction, yet there would be a ground for the legi&s;lature to make another grade in trea&s;on, viz. a di&s;|tinction of the highe&s;t &s;pecies of "levying war," on a con&s;pi|racy to effect a revolution; from that of a particular outrage tending to this end yet not projected with an ultimate view of that nature.

The overt act of trea&s;on of which he had been found guilty, was the accepting and exer|ci&s;ing &s;ome commi&s;&s;ion of police, in or about the city, when the Briti&s;h had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it. When a&s;ked what he had to &s;ay, why &s;entence &s;hould not be pronounced upon him, I was &s;truck with the &s;imple, natural, and apparently true language of the man; viz. "that what he had done was merely to &s;ave a little matter of property, and he recommended him&s;elf to the mercy of the government." I had at that time an acquaintance with &s;ome of the members of the executive, and had &s;aid what oc|curred to induce a pardon for him. I was led to under&s;tand, that the Council had a favourable leaning in his ca&s;e; but that the&s;e ideas of the enemy at home and abroad, rendered it nece&s;|&s;ary to e&s;tabli&s;h a conviction of our confidence in the event of our &s;truggle, by hanging traitors: which would be as much as to &s;ay, Do your wor&s;t; we are not afraid that you will ever have it in your power to hang us.</P>
<P>There was a farther rea&s;on in this ca&s;e; it was <HI>pendente lite,</HI> during the conte&s;t, and might be nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ave from all ac|ce&s;&s;ion of force to the enemy, by any voluntary act of &s;ervice, during the temporary occupation of a place. But in the ca&s;e of this in&s;urrection, all is pro&s;trate before the government. There is not a germ of re&s;i&s;tance remaining. Why kill a thing, if I may u&s;e a catachre&s;is, after it is dead?</P>
<P>Some one may turn to me and a&s;k, Does it not betray a con&s;ci|ou&s;ne&s;s of having contributed to the error of the&s;e people, and the misfortune of their pre&s;ent &s;ituation, to manife&s;t a zeal for their deliverance? Is it wrong to manife&s;t it? do I not relieve my&s;elf at lea&s;t from the charge of "de&s;erting the&s;e people". That was the rythm of my brother of the bar. Morgan had taken it up, and in his addre&s;s to the country, when he took his leave, talked of "bringing the people into trouble, and then de&s;erting them". If I had any hand in bringing them into trouble, cer|tainly I have not de&s;erted them; I have &s;tood by them; I have made no &s;eparate peace; that was well &s;een from the great anxiety manife&s;ted by government to extract te&s;timony again&s;t me. I was willing to have rendered &s;ervice as an advocate in the
<PB N="66" REF="028332_0263_0FD89886C91750F8">
court, if I had conceived that it would have &s;erved them. I have now made the&s;e ob&s;ervations for their &s;ake; is that de&s;erting them? But the fact is, I have not contributed to bring a &s;ingle individual into trouble. There is no one will accu&s;e me of it. On the contrary, there is no one who will not acquit me. It is therefore not a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of having in &s;ome remote degree contributed to their misfortunes, that prompts me to relieve them; though even from this &s;pring, my conduct would be lau|dable. It is the &s;ame principle of ab&s;tract humanity with that which led me to interfere in the ca&s;e of Carli&s;le. This principle is aided, doubtle&s;s, by that local partiality which imperceptibly ari&s;es, from vicinage of re&s;idence; but this is not blamable.</P>
<P>The fact is, that the two convicted at the court in May, are not worth hanging, on a charge of trea&s;on. I do not think that two more in&s;ignificant creatures could be found in the we&s;tern country. As to others, that are in cu&s;tody, they are of more note, but of better character; and &s;hould they be found guilty, my ob&s;ervations may be of u&s;e to induce the public to intere&s;t them&s;elves for their pardon.</P>

<P>BEFORE me, Adam&s;on Tannehill, e&s;q. one of the ju&s;|tices of the peace, in and for the &s;aid county, came Samuel E|valt, high &s;heriff of Allegheny county, who being &s;worn, &s;aith, that on the day of the burning of Neville's hou&s;e, he was a&s;ked by colonel Pre&s;ly Neville, and major Lenox to go with them to judge Wilkins; went, and was a&s;ked by judge Wilkins, wheth|er this deponent thought he could rai&s;e the po&s;&s;e of the county, to oppo&s;e the people coming to attack the hou&s;e. <HI>This deponent thought it could not be done. Judge Wilkins thought &s;o too;</HI> but propo&s;ed to meet at M'Lean's public hou&s;e, and con&s;ult Mr. Brackenridge. Did meet at the place, with judge Gib&s;on and Judge M'Dowell, and Mr. Brackenridge, who was a&s;ked what he thought of rai&s;ing the po&s;&s;e. He thought it was not practi|cable, as the greater part of the people of the county were ra|ther di&s;po&s;ed to join them, than oppo&s;e them, and it might make the matter wor&s;e; but propo&s;ed <HI>our going our&s;elves, to rea&s;on with them,</HI> which he thought would an&s;wer a better end than force, <HI>and offered to be one him&s;elf, that would go.</HI> It was agreed upon immediately that we &s;hould go; and in a very &s;hort &s;pace of time, perhaps not fifteen minutes, Mr. Brackenridge had gone home, got his hor&s;e, and was with us at the ferry to cro&s;s the river. After we had cro&s;&s;ed the river, Mr. Bracken|ridge a&s;ked the deponent, whether he did not know any way to the place where the people were &s;aid to be, different from the public road, as he was afraid the main road might be guard|ed by out parties, who might apprehend us, and delay or pre|vent our going forward to the main body. This deponent &s;aid, that he knew the old path that u&s;ed to be the road to Couche's fort, which was the place; and that there was little difference in the di&s;tance of the two ways. Mr. Brackenridge mentioned his apprehen&s;ions to the company, and it was agreed to take the old road. We rode with all the ha&s;te in our power: The &s;un was not then more than an hour high, and we got within half
<PB N="68" REF="028332_0265_0FD8988C408577F8">
a mile of the place, which was about eight miles from Pitt&s;burgh, a little before &s;un &s;et; we were there informed that the peo|ple had gone to Neville's hou&s;e; we rode on with ha&s;te to o|vertake them, until we came within a mile and a half of the hou&s;e, when we met &s;ome that were returning, and told what had been done. Mr. Brackenridge thought it not prudent then to go further, as it could be of no u&s;e, and there might be dan|ger, the people mi&s;con&s;truing what we came about; we all thought &s;o, and returned home.</P>
<P>This deponent from that time, had frequent conver&s;ations with Mr Brackenridge, about the affairs that took place, to the end of the di&s;turbance, and always knew his &s;entiments to be <HI>a|gain&s;t any violation of the laws,</HI> and frequently &s;aid, <HI>the authors will be brought to puni&s;hment.</HI> This deponent &s;ometime about the middle of the bu&s;ine&s;s, had been out in the country, and heard per&s;ons &s;ay, &s;peaking of the people that had undertaken to oppo&s;e the law, that if they could get Mr. Brackenridge with them, he would be more to them than a thou&s;and men. This deponent mentioned this to Mr. Brackenridge in a con|ver&s;ation directly after. His an&s;wer was, that <HI>they would never get that; he had no idea of joining &s;uch folly,</HI> or words to this effect. In his riding through the country as &s;heriff, he knows it to be the &s;en&s;e of the country, that Mr. Brackenridge had never any concern in the in&s;urrection, but all he did, was to prevent di&s;orders; and they applaud his knowledge and judg|ment of the times, and the policy u&s;ed by him in &s;aving the town of Pitt&s;burgh, and preventing the country from being in|volved in war.</P>
<P>This deponent thinks it ju&s;t to acknowledge, that it was in a degree <HI>owing to Mr. Brackenridge's advice,</HI> that this deponent has kept him&s;elf &s;o perfectly cle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> of all the di&s;turbances, &s;o as not to be in the lea&s;t drawn in, any manner what&s;oever.</P>

<P>Before me, John Wilkins, jun. one of the a&s;&s;ociate judges of the county of Allegheny, &s;tate of Penn&s;ylvania, came the &s;ub&s;criber, who being &s;worn, &s;aith, that on the morning pri|or to the meeting of the committee, as they were &s;aid to be, at a meeting hou&s;e on Mingo creek, this deponent was called up|on
<PB N="69" REF="028332_0266_0FD8988D7125C598">
by Mr. Brackenridge, and informed that he was about to go to that meeting, and wi&s;hed this deponent to acccompany him, which this deponent declined, con&s;idering the delicate &s;ituation of affairs, in con&s;equence of the violation of the laws, which had taken place. Mr. Brackenridge then &s;aid, that he did not wi&s;h this deponent to take any part on the occa&s;ion; but only to be <HI>a witne&s;s of the part he &s;hould him&s;elf take;</HI> and that this depo|nent might be &s;afe in going, as it was at <HI>the reque&s;t of col. Pre&s;|ly Neville, that he him&s;elf was about to go.</HI> This deponent how|ever declined.</P>
<P>About the 24th or 25th of July la&s;t, this deponent dined with Mr. Brackenridge at his own hou&s;e, at which time Mr. Brack|enridge appeared to him, to be under con&s;iderable anxiety of mind, declaring that he never had been in &s;o delicate a &s;itua+tion, in the cour&s;e of his life; expre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf in the follow|ing terms, or to this effect: "The people are all going to the devil; they have been guilty of rebellion, of trea&s;on, of ar&s;on; and I am afraid the matter is not over yet." Mr. Brackenridge al&s;o &s;aid, that individuals had taken his opinion as a lawyer, with re&s;pect to the nature and demerit of the conduct and crim|inality of the per&s;ons who had burnt and de&s;troyed the proper|ty of general Neville; and that he had given it to this effect.</P>
<P>Mr. Brackenridge, &s;peaking of the delicacy of his own &s;itua|tion, &s;aid, that if he did not go with the&s;e people the lengths they wi&s;hed, he would be obnoxious, and in danger; and that if he did take part in their mea&s;ures, he and they, would all be involved in common ruin, and go to the devil together. That he was oppo&s;ed to the funding &s;y&s;tem, that he con&s;idered it as a drop&s;ical &s;y&s;tem, calculated to &s;well mens fortunes to an im|mea&s;urable &s;ize, in the cour&s;e of a &s;ingle hour, and that it would thereby produce a degree of inequality in the circum|&s;tances and &s;ituation of men, unfavourable to a republican government; that this &s;y&s;tem was the <HI>tabe&s;cence</HI> of &s;enility in our government. This deponent farther &s;aith, that Mr. Brackenridge, in &s;peaking of the &s;pirit of oppo&s;ition that was likely to prevail, ob&s;erved, that to oppo&s;e the government, or any particular law, however obnoxious, was not only criminal in general, but highly impolitic for this country, on four grounds, viz. the four we&s;tern counties, from the circum&s;crip|tion of the boundaries, con&s;titute a ba&s;is too &s;mall for a &s;eparate government; the country is too poor to &s;upport one; it has no &s;ea port; and can have no importation, independent of the ea&s;tern parts of the continent; and finally, the&s;e counties are de&s;titute of re&s;ources, both in point of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, and materials
<PB N="70" REF="028332_0267_0FD8988EF0C3C7A8">
of war. So that &s;hould a conte&s;t en&s;ue with the United States&punc; the di&s;proportion of ability was in all re&s;pects &s;o great, that this country mu&s;t be finally un&s;ucce&s;sful.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of the&s;e ideas, expre&s;&s;ed by Mr. Bracken|ridge this deponent, had con&s;idered him as a friend to the gov|ernment, though oppo&s;ed to the pre&s;ent &s;y&s;tem of taxation, and was of this opinion at the time he left the country, which was the morning before the a&s;&s;embling the people in Braddock's field. But afterwards this deponent, having heard when at Carli&s;le, in the &s;tate of Penn&s;ylvania, of a letter &s;aid to be trea|&s;onable, written by Mr. Brackenridge to Tench Coxe, e&s;q. in Philadelphia, and by &s;aid Coxe brought forward to the govern|ment. This deponent began to doubt, and from the reports which generally prevailed, was led at length to conclude, that he mu&s;t have been deceived. This deponent is of opinion, however, that if the conduct of Mr. Brackenridge, from the time of the meeting at Braddock's field, until the appearance of the patriotic militia, has been as fair and unimpeachable, as it ap|peared to him prior to that time, it mu&s;t be a fair conclu&s;ion to con&s;ider the intentions of Mr. Brackenridge to have been upright, and his conduct not to be cen&s;ured; that in&s;tead of meriting reproach, he has de&s;erved well of his country.</P>

<P>Before me, an a&s;&s;ociate judge for the county of Allegheny, John Holling&s;worth, &s;worn, &s;aith, that he arrived in Pitt&s;burg on the 10th of July la&s;t, but had no conver&s;ation with Mr. Brackenridge concerning the oppo&s;ition to the revenue law, which then began to appear in this country, until after the &s;topping of the mail. A few days after he heard of that tran&s;|action, he was at the hou&s;e of Mr. Brackenridge, and &s;poke of it. Mr. Brackenridge declared his abhorrence of that &s;hameful breach of the law, and common faith, and in general terms ex|pre&s;&s;ed his di&s;approbation of oppo&s;ing laws by force. Conver&s;ing with him on the evening of the &s;econd of Augu&s;t, Mr. Brack|enridge u&s;ed this expre&s;&s;ion, or to this effect, "<HI>the country is now involved, and lenient mea&s;ures on the part of the government can alone &s;ave it.</HI>"</P>
<P>Before Mr. Brackenridge went to the meeting at Parkin|&s;on's ferry, he informed this deponent of his plan of having per|&s;ons
<PB N="71" REF="028332_0268_0FD8989607DCF080">
&s;ent from that meeting to the executive of the United States; who &s;hould give a true account of the in&s;urrection, and concert &s;uch mea&s;ures as might &s;ave the country from a civil war; &s;hewed this deponent an addre&s;s which he had drawn up to the Pre&s;ident, to be offered at the meeting, and &s;ent, if approved; expre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to this effect, "<HI>I con&s;ider this as my country, and I mu&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;t to avert the calamities that are impending over it, to accompli&s;h which the combination formed again&s;t the laws mu&s;t be &s;apped; to oppo&s;e it openly at this time, would add &s;trength to it; and ruin tho&s;e who are well di&s;po&s;ed.</HI>" The&s;e words left an im|pre&s;&s;ion on the mind of the deponent not ea&s;ily to be effaced.</P>
<P>A few days after this conver&s;ation took place, this deponent attended the meeting at Parkin&s;on' ferry, where, as this depo|nent thinks, Mr. Brackenridge pur&s;ued that line of conduct which he had marked out, before he left Pitt&s;burgh. The ar|rival of the commi&s;&s;ioners of the United States, during the time of the meeting precluded the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;ending per&s;ons to the executive. From that time, until the middle of September, had many opportunities of ob&s;erving his conduct, and frequent|ly conver&s;ed with him, without ob&s;erving any thing that induc|ed this deponent to believe that he had &s;werved from that duty which he owed his country; during that time was &s;o &s;ituated as to hear gentlemen high in office, and more capable of judging than him&s;elf, &s;peak of the conduct of Mr. Brackenridge during the troubles in this country, and always with re&s;pect.</P>

<P>That on the evening preceeding the meeting at Braddock's field, the inhabitants of Pitt&s;burgh had generally a&s;&s;embled, to con&s;ult on what mea&s;ures were nece&s;&s;ary to pur&s;ue on the oc|ca&s;ion. That before the people had proceeded to take the mat|ter up in any order, it was announced to them, that three or four gentlemen had arrived from Wa&s;hington county, with &s;ome alarming information re&s;pecting the meeting of the people on the next day, at Braddock's field. George Wallace, John Wil|kins, jun. and Hugh Henry Brackenridge, e&s;qs. were immedi|ately named to wait on them. On the return of tho&s;e gentle|men, they informed the people then a&s;&s;embled, that in con&s;e|quence of letters being intercepted in the mail, which had been taken, that certain per&s;ons were pro&s;cribed as obnoxious to the people, who were to a&s;&s;emble at Braddock's field on the next day; viz.

The mode of expul&s;ion was the next con&s;ideration; which was to be done by a committee of twenty-one, the choice of whom was ve&s;ted in the <HI>chairman, who named them generally; the chairman was named as one of the committee him&s;elf;</HI> his name &s;et down, (by the &s;ecretary, Mathew Erne&s;t), and he appeared to acqui|e&s;ce in the appointment.

<P>The deponent was one of the committee to Braddock's field, and on the route there, Mr. Brackenridge expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to the deponent to the following effect, that after all that had been done, he did not con&s;ider it as perfectly certain, that we might not &s;uffer violence from the fury of the people, on ac|count of the prevailing odium again&s;t the town, knowing that however far we had carried the appearance of a union in &s;enti|ment with the rioters, they would &s;ee through the ma&s;k, and treat us ill on the fir&s;t approach; under the&s;e impre&s;&s;ions Mr. Brackenridge propo&s;ed advancing with a flag.

conver&s;ations with Mr. Brackenridge, on the &s;ubject of the di&s;turbances, and always found him very anxious to undeceive the people, and bring them to order and obedience to the laws.</P>
<P>This deponent, the morning of the meeting at Mingo creek, was reque&s;ted by Mr. Brackenridge to accompany him to that meeting; he&s;itating very much, but afterwards &s;eeing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">olonel Neville, was prevailed upon to go.</P>
<P>At that meeting, Mr. Brackenridge at the beginning of a &s;peech he made on that occa&s;ion, &s;aid that tho&s;e concerned in the burning of general Neville's hou&s;e were guilty of trea&s;on; he powerfully oppo&s;ed, and luckily defeated the re&s;olutions which was to &s;upport the brave fellows who had attended at the burning general Neville's hou&s;e; he <HI>advi&s;ed to try by every po&s;&s;ible means to make peace with the government, and get an act of oblivion, and offered to go him&s;elf to Philadelphia, if it was agreeable to the people. The turn he gave to the bu&s;ine&s;s, &s;aved us from the mo&s;t delicate &s;ituation that this deponent ever thought him|&s;elf in;</HI> being apprehen&s;ive that if the que&s;tion had been put, and we had voted again&s;t it, we would have been in per&s;onal danger; and voting for it, would involve us in a crime. After the &s;peech of Mr. Brackenridge there was a long &s;ilence, and mo&s;t of the people went out. This deponent went out with the other per&s;ons of Pitt&s;burgh; and &s;hortly after, on the &s;ug|ge&s;tion of Mr. Brackenridge, that &s;ome other delicate que&s;tions might be brought forward, it was judged be&s;t to get off as &s;peed|ily as po&s;&s;ible. We went away, and Mr. Brackenridge with us, as unob&s;ervedly as we could. We came to the hou&s;e, about half a mile, where we had left our hor&s;es; having taken dinner, and ordered our hor&s;es, which had taken up an hour or more, it was &s;ugge&s;ted by &s;ome one pre&s;ent, that we had come off ab|rubtly, and that a bad con&s;truction might be put upon it, that we had been there as &s;pies, it would be well for Mr. Bracken|ridge, at lea&s;t ju&s;t to go back, and take leave; which he did, and returned to us in as &s;hort a time as was nece&s;&s;ary to go and come back.</P>
<P>At that meeting, this deponent did not &s;ee Mr. Brackenridge having private conver&s;ation with Mar&s;hall or Bradford, or does he think it probable that he could have any, from the &s;hortne&s;s of the time we were there before the opening of the meeting.</P>
<P>This deponent was one of the committee of twenty-one, ap|pointed by a town-meeting of the inhabitants of Pitt&s;burgh, to carry into effect &s;everal re&s;olutions, on the expelling certain per&s;ons. With re&s;pect to the&s;e per&s;ons in any act or language

of Mr. Brackenridge, at that time or &s;ince, in all the conver&s;a|tions on this &s;ubject, this deponent did not di&s;cover the lea&s;t ground to lead him to believe, that Mr. Brackenridge <HI>had any &s;atisfaction in the expelling them, or acted under any private re|&s;entment, whatever difference might exi&s;t with any of them.</HI></P>
<P>This deponent was one of the delegates &s;ent by the people of Pitt&s;burgh to Parkin&s;on's ferry, on the 14th of Augu&s;t. At that meeting, in all Mr. Brackenridge did or &s;aid, his object appeared to be to conciliate to order, &s;ugge&s;ting the propriety of making terms with government, and obtain an act of oblivion.</P>
<P>In general this deponent can &s;ay, that in the affair of Brad|dock's fields, Mr. Brackenridge acted, as far as this deponent knows, with good policy to &s;ave the town; and on other occa|&s;ions, <HI>to get an indemnity for the people, and &s;ave them from a war with government.</HI></P>

<P>Before me, Alexander Addi&s;on, pre&s;ident of the court of common pleas, &amp;c. came George Robin&s;on, chief burge&s;s of the borough of Pitt&s;burgh, who being duly &s;worn, depo&s;eth and &s;aith, that at the reque&s;t of Mr. Brackenridge, he went to the meeting of Mingo creek. Mr. Brackenridge had informed him that it was at the reque&s;t of <HI>col. Pre&s;ly Neville, that he him|&s;elf was going.</HI> Mr. Brackenridge &s;aid he wi&s;hed this deponent to go, as being a public officer, the chief burge&s;s of the town, as he wi&s;hed to have &s;ome per&s;ons <HI>to bear te&s;timony of his conduct, as the &s;ituation might be delicate.</HI> This deponent found the &s;itua|tion delicate enough, when a motion was brought forward to &s;upport what had been done at burning general Neville's hou&s;e, and which was warmly &s;upported. This deponent being much alarmed at the time, le&s;t the que&s;tion &s;hould be put on this ac|count, that by voting in the affirmative, we &s;hould be drawn in as accomplices, and by voting again&s;t it we might be in per&s;onal danger. After an inflammatory &s;peech by a certain per&s;on, there was a &s;ilence for &s;ome time. During this time, the deponent was in great anxiety, le&s;t the que&s;tion &s;hould be put, when Mr. Brackenridge addre&s;&s;ed the meeting in a &s;peech of &s;ome length, and as appeared with great anxiety of mind. The &s;peech, in the opinion of this deponent, appeared to be calculated to parry the que&s;tion. He informed them, that we were not dele|gated by the town to do any act for them, and therefore if we
<PB N="76" REF="028332_0273_0FD8989BB16BB008">
gave any vote, it could only be as individuals. That as an indi|vidual, he woud give his opinion. Here Mr. Brackenridge ex|plained the nature and con&s;equences of what had been done; he plainly told them, that all concerned were guilty of trea&s;on, <HI>that it would be better not to draw any more in, as they could be of more u&s;e as mediators with the government, than as accomplices;</HI> that the well known lenity of the Pre&s;ident of the United States, gave rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e that an accommodation might be brought a|bout, before, he would proceed to extremities; that the pre&s;ent meeting was but an incon&s;iderable part of the four counties; that a larger meeting might be called, by delegates regularly appointed, and that commi&s;&s;ioners might be &s;ent to the Pre&s;i|dent, in order to bring about an accommodation; that tho' it would not be convenient for him to go at that time, yet if &s;uch a mea&s;ure was adopted, <HI>he was willing to go, and to render any &s;ervice in his power.</HI> This deponent does not recollect particu|larly, but has &s;ome recollection of Mr. Brackenridge mention|ing, <HI>that the damage done mu&s;t be repaired.</HI></P>
<P>After Mr. Brackenridge clo&s;ed his &s;peech, there appeared to be an adjournment, without a motion made for that purpo&s;e. During this interval, Mr. Brackenridge urged us to get off as un|di&s;coveredly as po&s;&s;ible, le&s;t we &s;houd be drawn further in. Du|ring the time that we were out, after the &s;peech of Mr. Brack|enridge, there was a good deal of murmuring among&s;t the people, and this deponent &s;uppo&s;es this had given Mr. Brackenridge ap|prehen&s;ions, and he had informed this deponent &s;ince, that it was what alarmed him. We went away on this, and Mr. Brackenridge &s;lipped after us. As we cro&s;&s;ed a finall run a &s;hort di&s;tance from the meeting hou&s;e, we were called after by &s;ome per&s;ons to come back; but we hurried off as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible to the hou&s;e where we had left our hor&s;es. While there, it was &s;ugge&s;ted by &s;ome of the company, that as we had come off &s;o abruptly, it might be well if Mr. Brackenridge, or &s;ome one, &s;hould return and make &s;ome excu&s;e. Mr. Brackenridge took his hor&s;e, and &s;aid he would ju&s;t ride over and make &s;ome ex|cu&s;e. He rode over, and came back in a very &s;hort time, &s;o that we wondered that he could have been there and come back, and &s;aid he had found them ju&s;t breaking up. In our way home, this deponent mentioning to Mr. Brackenridge the for|tunate e&s;cape we had made, Mr. Brackenridge made u&s;e of this expre&s;&s;ion "he had never been in &s;o delicate a &s;ituation before in his life, <HI>and he would be damned if he would have been drawn in to be guilty of high trea&s;on, for ten thou&s;and pounds.</HI>" The depo|nent has been pre&s;ent at other meetings &s;ince, in the town of
<PB N="77" REF="028332_0274_0FD8989D42513B30">
Pitt&s;burgh, and heard Mr. Brackenridge's &s;entiments on various occa&s;ions, and ob&s;erved his conduct, and can &s;ay, to the be&s;t of his knowledge, that with re&s;pect to the people that were expelled from the town, and every thing el&s;e that was done, he <HI>acted from no &s;elfi&s;h motive of re&s;entment or di&s;po&s;ition to hurt any man;</HI> but from motives of policy, to moderate matters and prevent mi&s;|chief; and this deponent knows this to be the general &s;entiment of the people of Pitt&s;burg, and they con&s;ider them&s;elves indebt|ed to his policy in a great degree for the &s;afety of the town in the affair of Braddock's field, when we were led to apprehend plunder and de&s;truction from the fury of the people that had met there.</P>

<P>Being about to go to Pitt&s;burgh, fell in with a body of peo|ple collecting for the burying captain John M'Farlane, who had fallen at burning general Neville's hou&s;e; David Hamilton had been deputed by a committee of tho&s;e people to go to Pitt&s;|burgh, to return the pi&s;tols taken from the mar&s;hall, and to have a fulfilment from him of what had been agreed upon, on his part. Under&s;toood from Hamilton, that he had con&s;ented to go, in order to prevent the people coming in them&s;elves, and doing mi&s;chief; for there was danger of their going in, at that time. Went with Hamilton to Pitt&s;burgh, and met the mar&s;hall and colonel Neville. Hamilton explained his bu&s;ine&s;s, returning the pi&s;tols, and required a fulfilment of what was a|greed upon; viz. that he would &s;erve no further writs, and not return tho&s;e that were &s;erved. The mar&s;hall &s;aid, he had not agreed not to return the writs. A query was then in the mind of Hamilton, what effect the returns would have. At his reque&s;t, I went to Mr. Brackenridge, to a&s;k his opinion as a lawyer. <HI>He &s;aid it was a delicate point, and he would talk to the mar&s;hall.</HI> On this he went out, and came in with <HI>the mar&s;hall and colonel Neville.</HI> Upon that I went out, and after &s;ome time returned; and Mr. Brackenridge &s;aid he was not much acquaint|ed with the practice of the federal courts, but would con&s;ult, and give his opinion in the morning.</P>
<P>He gave his opinion in writing; which Hamilton thought would not be &s;atisfactory to the committee. It was under&s;tood the committee would be &s;itting till he returned.

We accordingly went on to Pitt&s;burgh, when we arrived there, a number of people came to the hou&s;e where we put up, to en|quire, of us if we knew what object the people had in view, that were to a&s;&s;emble at Braddock's fields? We informed them that it was in con&s;equence of letters that had been found in the mail, written by &s;everal per&s;ons in that place to government, mi&s;tat|ing their conduct (as they termed it), and that the people con|ceived them to be very obnoxious characters; particularly major Kirkpatrick, Mr. Bri&s;on, and Mr. Day, and it was our opinion that if &s;ome of tho&s;e that had written the letters, did not leave the town, that it was in danger of being de&s;troyed from the ap|parent rage of the people.

On hearing that we had come to town, they ap|pointed a committee, con&s;i&s;ting of Mr. Brackenridge, doctor Wilkins, and judge Wallace, to confer with us, and to have our opinion on the &s;ubject. We produced to them the letters that had been taken out of the mail, viz. major Butler to gen|eral Knox; general Gib&s;on to governor Mifflin; Mr. Bri&s;on to the &s;ame; colonel Neville to general Morgan; and one other, without any &s;ignature, to the &s;ecretary of trea&s;ury, &s;aid to be hand writing of Edward Day; which were read in their pre|&s;ence. They a&s;ked us what we thought was the intention of the people, that were to a&s;&s;emble at Braddock's fields the next day. We gave it as our opinion, <HI>that the town was in eminent danger of being de&s;troyed, if &s;ome of the obnoxious characters were not &s;ent away, for that we our&s;elves had been in&s;ulted on the road,
<PB N="83" REF="028332_0280_0FD898ADB49E8CF0">
coming there, by &s;ome of the people, when they under&s;tood we were going into Pitt&s;burgh; for they &s;aid we were going there as &s;pies, to tell the people to get out of the way, and that we ought to be taken pri&s;oners, and they actually rai&s;ed a party to follow us for that purpo&s;e,</HI> as we were afterwards informed. Mr. Bracken|ridge a&s;ked us, who we thought appeared to be the principal objects of the people's rage. We gave it as our opinion from what we had di&s;covered from them, that major Butler, major Kirkpatrick, Mr. Bri&s;on, and Mr. Day, were the characters that the populace appeared to be the mo&s;t enraged at. Mr. Brackenridge replied, As to major Butler, it was out of the que&s;|tion to have any think to do with him; he being a federal offi|cer, and entirely unconnected with the citizens. After receiv|ing this information from us, they returned to the town-meet|ing, and gave the information to them they had received from us; in con&s;equence of which they entered into re&s;olutions to expel certain per&s;ons, as will appear from the hand-bills pub|li&s;hed immediately after. We went on the nex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> morning, to Braddock's fields, with great numbers of people from Pitt&s;burgh in company. When we came there, I di&s;covered a great num|ber of people much di&s;&s;atisfied, on the account that <HI>general Gib|&s;on and colonel Neville</HI> were not al&s;o expelled. I was cho&s;en a member of the committee, which did not meet until the next morning; when Mr. Bradford produced the letters that had been kept out of the mail, and read them before the committee him&s;elf. He appeared much di&s;&s;atisfied that general Gib&s;on and colonel Neville were not &s;ent away; for he &s;aid they were as obnoxious to the people as any of them that were gone, and that they ought not to be &s;uffered to remain in the country; for they were enemies to the people, and mu&s;t be &s;ent off. It was motioned for them to be &s;uffered to remain until the meet|ing that was to be at Parkin&s;on's ferry, on the 14th of Augu&s;t, and for them to come forward to the meeting, and endeavour to exculpate them&s;elves from the charges that were again&s;t them; but it was over ruled. Mr. Brackenridge &s;poke partic|ularly again&s;t the <HI>expul&s;ion of general Gib&s;on, by ob&s;erving that he was a man advanced in years, and that he always had conceived him to be a man who could do little harm, and therefore thought he might be &s;uffered to remain, as he was far from being a dangerous man, in his opinion. Mr. Brackenridge, in my opinion, &s;eemed to have a &s;trong de&s;ire, that the expul&s;ion of both general Gib&s;on and colonel Neville, &s;hould at lea&s;t be po&s;tponed until the meeting above alluded to, in order to give them an opportunity to acquit them|&s;elves
<PB N="84" REF="028332_0281_0FD898B0CA008FE8">
of the charges, that the people had advanced again&s;t them.</HI> It was all over ruled, and I believe chiefly through the interpo|&s;ition of Mr. Bradford. Mr. Brackenridge, to the be&s;t of my recollection, &s;poke much in favour of allowing them &s;ome time to prepare them&s;elves to move away, upon which it was agreed to give them ten days.</P>
<P>Mr. Bradford then &s;poke concerning the expul&s;ion of major Craig; for he &s;aid he had been informed that major Craig &s;hould have &s;aid (immediately after the burning of gen. Neville's hou&s;e) that he would let the damned ra&s;cals &s;ee that the exci&s;e law &s;hould be inforced, for that he would open an office of in&s;pection in his own hou&s;e. <HI>Mr. Bradford was reque&s;ted to give his author; he replied that he could not recollect, but that he heard it mentioned among the people.</HI> It was then referred to the gentlemen on the committee that repre&s;ented the people of Pitt&s;burgh, viz. Dr. Wil|kins, Mr. John M'Ma&s;ters, and <HI>Mr. Brackenridge. It appeared that neither of them could give any information on this &s;ubject.</HI> Mr. Brackenridge further &s;aid, that he had but very little conver&s;a|tion with major Craig; for he did not recollect of any &s;ince the burning of general Neville's hou&s;e, except what happened a day or two before coming to Braddock's fields, when he mentioned that meeting major Craig in the &s;treet of Pitt&s;burg, Craig &s;ays, Mr. Brackenridge, what can be the intention of the people col|lecting at Braddock's field? Brackenridge replied, he knew of no other intention they could have, but that they conceived that Braddock at his defeat &s;unk &s;ome pieces of artillery in the river, and that they intended to rai&s;e them, and come and attack the garri&s;on at Pitt&s;burg; which was all the conception he had at that time of the &s;ubject. It was then <HI>motioned, either by Mr. Brackenridge, or &s;econded by him, that if major Craig was to be im|mediately expelled, it would tend in all probability to defeat the mea|&s;ures of government in their operation again&s;t the Indians; for major Craig having charge of the whole of the quarter ma&s;ter's &s;tores then at Pitt&s;burgh, that if he was then &s;ent away and nobody there to &s;upply his place, it might be attended with very bad con&s;equences to the community. Mr. Brackenridge farther &s;aid, that it would be much better to &s;u&s;pend the expul&s;ion of major Craig at this time, and wait for an opportunity of applying to the Pre&s;ident of the Unit|ed States to have him removed from office, and have &s;ome other per&s;on appointed in his place.</HI> No objection was made to the propo&s;ition, by any of the members of the committee, and after doing &s;ome trifling bu&s;ine&s;s more, the committee ro&s;e.

<OPENER><SALUTE>Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>At your reque&s;t, I &s;hall give you a &s;hort detail of the circum|&s;tances leading to, and of the principal traits of your conduct, at Mingo meeting hou&s;e. I remember that it was the general opinion of the inhabitants of Pitt&s;burgh, that it would be pru|dent a number of per&s;ons &s;hould be collected from this place, to meet tho&s;e who were collecting from various parts of the country. No in&s;tructions to my knowledge were given to tho&s;e who went. But I under&s;tood the general purport or intention of our going there, was to hear and report. You a&s;ked me if I would make one of the number that would go; I he&s;itated for &s;ome time, and until I had a&s;ked the opinion of colonel Pre&s;ly Neville, which was, "I &s;ee no harm in your going there, if you chu&s;e to venture; and if you do, I will thank you to carry a letter for me to the chairman of the committee, contradicting &s;ome fal&s;e a&s;per&s;ions which have been indu&s;triou&s;ly ci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">lated, re&s;pecting the mar&s;hall and my&s;elf, being relea&s;ed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> our words of honour to hold our&s;elves as pri&s;oners o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">nd, that night my father's hou&s;e was burned." I accepted the of|fice, and came back to you, and told you I would go. When we arrived at Jacob Friggly's hou&s;e, near the meeting hou&s;e, in the cour&s;e of various conver&s;ations, a tall man there, with red hair, frequently expre&s;&s;ed a warmth of affection for Pre&s;ly Neville; &s;eemingly commi&s;erated his &s;ituation, and took &s;ome credit to him&s;elf in re&s;cuing him when he was made a pri&s;oner the night afore&s;aid; but at the &s;ame time was &s;till making &s;ome
<PB N="86" REF="028332_0283_0FD898B3B1BF2F08">
&s;arca&s;tic ob&s;ervations on his father. I found the temper of the people were wound up to a very high pitch, and I took this fa|vourable opportunity of delivering colonel Neville's letter to him, after finding that his name was Parkin&s;on, and that he had con&s;iderable influence; telling him that the colonel had de|&s;ired me to deliver his letter to him in ca&s;e I could find him, and reque&s;ted he would deliver it to the chairman. He readily took it; and it was the fir&s;t thing brought upon the carpet, at the meeting. The &s;ecretary read the letter; but no ob&s;ervations followed. After &s;ome &s;ilence, a per&s;on &s;tood up, and made a motion, that the burning of general Neville's hou&s;e, and tho&s;e concerned in it, &s;hould be ju&s;tified and &s;upported. I could ob|&s;erve the people of the meeting con&s;iderably agitated; colonel Mar&s;hall, of Wa&s;hington, was the fir&s;t who ventured to oppo&s;e this motion; and he &s;eemed to do &s;o both with fear and trem|bling. After this &s;peech was over, David Bradford, e&s;q. aro&s;e and beckoned to Mr. Benjamin Parkin&s;on (as captain Jo&s;iah Tannehill informed me, who had mixed with the croud, and happened to &s;it down on the forms in the middle of the church clo&s;e by him), a&s;ked him if the relation which colonel Neville had given in his letter, was true. To which que&s;tion Mr. Parkin&s;on putting his hand to his brea&s;t an&s;wered, it is too true. Mr. Bradford then dropping the &s;ubject of the letter, began a mo&s;t violent and inflammatory oration in &s;upport of the fir&s;t motion. I ob&s;erved Mr. Brackenridge in the cour&s;e of this oration, who being &s;eated at the we&s;t end of the church, and oppo&s;ite to the principal part of the Pitt&s;burghers, who had &s;eated them&s;elves at the ea&s;t corner by them&s;elves, in great ag|itation, often throwing his head down on his hand, in the atti|tude of &s;tudy. At length Mr. Bradford's &s;peech being ended&punc; Mr. Brackenridge advanced nearly to the middle of the hou&s;e, and about oppo&s;ite the chairman, and began his &s;peech; &s;lowly irregular; for the current of the people's prejudice &s;eemed to be &s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ngly again&s;t him. He fir&s;t opened the rea&s;ons why the few <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">&s;ons from Pitt&s;burgh came there; that they were not in&s;tructed; nor had they any delegated powers to agree or di&s;|agree on any propo&s;ition that might be made, they came only to hear and report. He took various methods of diverting the attention of the audience from the &s;peech that preceeded his.</P>
<P>Sometimes he would give a &s;arca&s;tical &s;troke at the exci&s;e, and the inventors of it; and then tell &s;ome droll &s;tory thereto relating; in order, as I apprehend, to unbend the audience's minds from the &s;erious tone to which they had been wrought
<PB N="87" REF="028332_0284_0FD898BA86917908">
up. He viewed the &s;ubject before him in various lights; and then entered warmly on his main argument, which was to di&s;&s;uade the audience from the fir&s;t propo&s;ition. He told them in direct words, "that he hoped they would not involve the whole coun|try in a crime which could not be called le&s;s than high trea&s;on; that this would certainly bring the re&s;entment of the general government on us, and there would be none left to intercede."</P>
<P>The audience &s;eemed petrified, thunder&s;truck with &s;uch ob|&s;ervations; and when he had done, not a per&s;on &s;eemed de&s;ir|ous of renewing the arguments. Silence en&s;ued for &s;ome time, and then the company broke up, and &s;ome went to drink at the &s;pring, and others in little knots or clubs were di&s;per&s;ed over the green. Tho&s;e who came from Pitt&s;burgh, finding that the audience was to be called to the church once more, took this opportunity of making the be&s;t of their way to Mr. Jacob Friggly's. The company met again; but I know not that they did any bu&s;ine&s;s of con&s;equence; for Mr. Brackenridge was &s;oon with us, and we took our hor&s;es, and rode to Pitt&s;burgh.</P>
<P>I was al&s;o at the meeting of Parkin&s;on's ferry, where Mr. Brackenridge did not &s;eem to be a principal among the &s;peakers. I remember to have heard him make two or three humorous ob&s;ervations, which &s;et the people a laughing <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I have repre&s;ented my&s;elf as a principal &s;peaker; and the fact is, that I was; but &s;peaking only at critical moments, and that in a few words, I did not &s;eem to be a principal, on the occa&s;ion.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>Before me, Adam&s;on Tannehill, e&s;q. one of the ju&s;tices of the peace, in and for &s;aid county, came James Clow, town clerk of the borough of Pitt&s;burgh, &s;worn, &s;aith, that he, this depo|nent, was a member of the committee of twenty-one, appoint|ed at the meeting of the inhabitants of Pitt&s;burgh, general John Gib&s;on in the chair, the evening before the a&s;&s;embling at Brad|dock's fields.</P>
<P>At a meeting of this committee, &s;ometime after the day of Braddock's fields, it was explained to the committee by Mr. Brackenridge, that the two gentlemen, general John Gib&s;on, and colonel Pre&s;ly Neville, who were to leave the town by or|der of the committee of battalions, of Braddock's fields, and which the committee of Pitt&s;burgh had undertaken to &s;ee carri|ed into effect, (as this deponent under&s;tood), wi&s;hed that com|mittee to appoint per&s;ons to go with them on their way, as a guard, until they &s;hould be at &s;uch a di&s;tance as to think them|&s;elves &s;afe, and al&s;o to furni&s;h them with pa&s;&s;ports.</P>
<P>At the opening of the meeting of the committee, John Wil|kins, e&s;q. was fir&s;t in the chair, but leaving it to attend &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s, this deponent was appointed to the chair, but had &s;ome he&s;itation, as not knowing but it might bring him into trouble. On which Mr. Brackenridge &s;aid, that it was at the reque&s;t of the gentlemen them&s;elves, that the committee met, to give a guard and pa&s;&s;ports, and that it was for their &s;ervice, and not their injury, &s;o there need be no apprehen&s;ion of giv|ing offence; and that if this deponent did not take the chair, and &s;ign the pa&s;&s;ports, he him&s;elf was willing (if cho&s;en) to do it.</P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="028332_0286_0FD898BD94D7D0C0">On this the deponent took the chair, and it was agreed that per&s;ons &s;hould be appointed, and that the gentlemen them&s;elves who were to go away &s;hould chu&s;e who they would wi&s;h to go with them, and that any, or all of the committee, would go with them to any di&s;tance.</P>
<P><HI>Double pa&s;&s;ports were made out for each;</HI> the one of a few lines, the other of a con&s;iderable length, dictated by Mr. Brack|enridge to the clerk.

<P>Before me, John Wilkins, jun. one of the a&s;&s;ociate judges of &s;aid county, came Mathew Erne&s;t, who being duly &s;worn, de|po&s;eth as follows: That at the town-meeting of the inhabitants of Pitt&s;burgh, the evening previous to the a&s;&s;embling at Brad|dock's fields, general John Gib&s;on in the chair, and this depo|nent acting as clerk. General John Gib&s;on was taken down as one of the committee of twenty-one, and his name afterwards erazed, in con&s;equence of Mr. Brackenridge &s;peaking in a low voice to general Gib&s;on, in words to this effect, you mu&s;t not be on this committee; I have rea&s;ons for it which I &s;hall ex|plain to you hereafter.</P>
<P>Afterwards, the &s;ame evening, this deponent was pre&s;ent when the committee of twenty-one drew up certain re&s;olves, to be &s;ent to the people at Braddock's fields, it was perfectly un|der&s;tood
<PB N="90" REF="028332_0287_0FD8856DC24E7058">
that the&s;e re&s;olves were not &s;erious, but for the mo|ment, and the u&s;ing the expre&s;&s;ion "the common cau&s;e," in one of the re&s;olves, produced a general laugh. In general, this deponent can &s;ay, that the whole bu&s;ine&s;s of Braddock's fields, as far as re&s;pects the town of Pitt&s;burgh, was a ma&s;k, and the expelling certain per&s;ons, was for their own &s;akes, as well as for the &s;afety of the town. This deponent was pre&s;ent at the meeting of the committee of twenty-one, who were cal|led upon to furni&s;h general John Gib&s;on and colonel Neville with pa&s;&s;ports and a guard, when they left the town of Pitt&s;|burgh. That double pa&s;&s;ports were made out for them, dictat|ed to this deponent by Mr. Brackenridge; a private, and a public one; a public one for the &s;ake of the country, through which they had to pa&s;s, and a private one for the people el&s;e|where, in order to &s;hew the real cau&s;e of their going away. In all, <HI>this deponent could di&s;cover nothing in Mr. Brackenridge but good will, and a di&s;po&s;ition to &s;erve the&s;e gentlemen.</HI></P>
<P>Some time before the 21&s;t of September la&s;t, this deponent thinks about three weeks, or more, but does not remember preci&s;ely, but knows it mu&s;t have been a con&s;iderable time be|fore the 21&s;t, becau&s;e this deponent on that day left this coun|try; Mr. Brackenridge under&s;tanding that this deponent was a|bout to go below, a&s;ked this deponent if he would venture to carry a letter to Philadelphia, <HI>which he did not like to ri&s;k by the po&s;t, for fear of being intercepted in this country, and that private per&s;ons were unwilling to carry letters, lo&s;t they &s;hould be &s;eized with them, and by that means, became obnoxious them&s;elves.</HI> This deponent &s;aid he would venture it, but did not go for a con&s;iderable time after this; and &s;o heard no more of it.

<P>Before me, Adam&s;on Tannehill, one of the ju&s;tices of the peace, in and for &s;aid county, came Robert Richey, a ju&s;tice of the peace for the &s;aid county, who being duly &s;worn, &s;aith, that on the morning after the meeting at Parkin&s;on's ferry, early in the morning he came into Pitt&s;burgh, purpo&s;ely to have &s;ome conver&s;ation with Mr. Brackenridge, from whom he thought
<PB N="91" REF="028332_0288_0FD898C2C85EF990">
he could get information, and how to conduct in the &s;ituation of affairs.</P>
<P>Mr. Brackenridge advi&s;ed this deponent, that it was be&s;t to be careful and &s;ay but little. <HI>The government in a &s;hort time would come forward and &s;upport it&s;elf.</HI> From the conver&s;ation of Mr. Brackenridge this deponent perfectly under&s;tood him <HI>as di&s;approving of the irregularities that had taken place; but that it was policy to conceal &s;entiments until it was &s;afe to expre&s;s them.</HI> This deponent con&s;ulted Mr. Brackenridge, repo&s;ing confidence in him as a man of judgment. On the day of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, the 11th of September, Mr. Brackenridge <HI>came to the meeting of the di&s;trict in which the deponent lived; he &s;aid it had been the fourth di&s;trict he had been through that day, in order to advi&s;e the people to &s;ign the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. At this meeting advi&s;ed the &s;igning the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, and &s;eemed greatly anxious that all &s;hould &s;ubmit.</HI></P>

<P>Before me, Adam&s;on Tannehill, e&s;q. a ju&s;tice of the peace, in and for &s;aid county, came Andrew Wat&s;on, who being &s;worn, &s;aith, that living next door to Mr. Brackenridge, and keeping a public hou&s;e, Mr. Brackenridge was occa&s;ionally there during the di&s;turbance in the country, and this deponent heard his &s;entiments, often conver&s;ing with the people, and they al|ways were again&s;t the oppo&s;ition to the laws that had taken place. Once about the height of the di&s;turbance, Mr. Brack|enridge was rea&s;oning with a man from the country, and not be|ing able to convince him as he wi&s;hed, Mr. Brackenridge broke out into a great rage, and &s;poke with great pa&s;&s;ion, and told the man the people had been guilty of high trea&s;on. The man &s;eemed alarmed at this; and went away. This deponent can &s;ay, that he has ob&s;erved all that has been &s;aid or done by Mr. Brackenridge, in the cour&s;e of the di&s;turbance to have been for peace, and not at all favouring any oppo&s;ition to government, &s;o far as this deponent had an opportunity of ob&s;erving. This deponent was a member of the committee of twenty-one, and was pre&s;ent at their deliberations, and never ob&s;erved any appearance of ill will in Mr. Brackenridge to the per&s;ons that were &s;ent away, but a di&s;po&s;ition to &s;ave them, and the town. This deponent went to Braddock's fields, and from what he
<PB N="92" REF="028332_0289_0FD898C5C4A331E0">
&s;aw and heard there, was &s;o alarmed that he thought the town would be burnt, and came ha&s;tily home, and dug a hole in the floor of his cellar, and buried his books and papers.</P>

<P>Before me, Adam&s;on Tannehill, a ju&s;tice of the peace in and for &s;aid county, came William Henry Beaumont, of the bor|ough of Pitt&s;burgh, who being &s;worn, &s;aith, that &s;ometime early la&s;t &s;pring, or, in the la&s;t of the winter, this deponent began to be employed occa&s;ionally by Mr. Brackenridge to write for him in his office, and continued to be &s;o thro' the whole of the late in&s;urrection in this country. That Mr. Brackenridge u&s;ually dictated his letters of corre&s;pondence to this deponent; that during the whole of the in&s;urrection, but two letters were dictated by Mr. Brackenridge to this deponent that had the lea&s;t reference to any political &s;ubject; nor does this deponent know of any written or &s;ent by Mr. Brackenridge to any per&s;ons on any political &s;ubject whatever, except the&s;e two letters which were to Tench Coxe, of Philadelphia, both dictated to this de|ponent, viz. one of the 8th of Augu&s;t, 1794, and the other of the 15th September, following.</P>
<P>At the time of the dictating and writing the fir&s;t, this depon|ent &s;ugge&s;ted to Mr. Brackenridge, that it was nece&s;&s;ary to be cautious how he expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf with regard to the country at that moment, as it was probable the mail might again be rob|bed, and he might be rendered obnoxious to the people. His an&s;wer was as nearly as this deponent can recollect, in words to this effect, That he had taken care of that; that he meant to give government a real &s;tatement of the ferment the country was in, but at the &s;ame time, had put in &s;ome things that would &s;ave him from the people, &s;hould the letter fall into their hands. This deponent under&s;tood at the time, that Mr. Brackenridge was apprehen&s;ive the government might be mi&s;|led, by wrong information <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;pecting the magnitude of the dan|ger, and the extent of the in&s;urrection, and it was his wi&s;h that the danger might be viewed in the light it appeared to him&s;elf, great and momentuous, not trifling and in&s;ignificant; that mea&s;ures might be taken accordingly. That this deponent had that impre&s;&s;ion from the expre&s;&s;ions of Mr. Brackenridge
<PB N="93" REF="028332_0290_0FD898C777F7E568">
at that time, as he expre&s;&s;ed his apprehen&s;ions that a ju&s;t &s;tate|ment would not be given by the pro&s;cribed per&s;ons who were &s;ent away. This deponent did not under&s;tand Mr. Bracken|ridge as que&s;tioning the veracity of tho&s;e per&s;ons, <HI>but as &s;u&s;pec|ting from the temper of their minds, that they would not &s;ee things in a proper view, being under the influence of chagrin.</HI> That at the time Mr. Brackenridge dictated the &s;econd letter to this deponent, he expre&s;&s;ed with &s;ome warmth and irrit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ion of mind, that his fir&s;t letter &s;hould have been mi&s;under&s;tood by the government, as he was informed it was; that he wrote this &s;econd letter to explain it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I believe this was not publi&s;hed.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>That this deponent was one of tho&s;e who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">companied Mr. Brackenridge to the meeting at Mingo creek, that it was at the reque&s;t of Mr. Brackenridge that this deponent went, in order to vouch for his conduct on that occa&s;ion, and bear te&s;ti|mony of what &s;hould be &s;aid or done by him, con&s;idering the &s;ituation as delicate.</P>
<P>This deponent found the &s;ituation &s;ufficiently delicate; and on a motion being brought forward early in the meeting, and &s;trongly &s;upported, this deponent was greatly alarmed, being apprehen&s;ive of being brought in to give a vote on a que&s;tion of that nature, which was to pledge our&s;elves to &s;upport what had been done; which as this deponent under&s;tood, was the violence and outrage that had ju&s;t before taken place. This deponent was alarmed, becau&s;e to go away might expo&s;e to in|&s;ult and per&s;onal danger, as he under&s;tood the people of Pitt&s;|burgh were con&s;idered in an unfavourable point of view by the people of the country; and to vote again&s;t the que&s;tion would be equally dangerous, or more &s;o; and to vote for it, this de|ponent could not think of, as it would involve in the criminality.</P>
<P>In a &s;peech of con&s;iderable length made at this juncture by Mr. Brackenridge, he appeared to have the &s;ame impre&s;&s;ions; and with all the art and addre&s;s that was in his power, wi&s;hed to parry the que&s;tion, without rendering him&s;elf obnoxious to the multitude. The ob&s;ervations made by Mr. Brackenridge in the cour&s;e of the &s;peech, were, as nearly as this deponent can recollect, to the following purport: Tho&s;e fir&s;t made were of a nature to conciliate them (the per&s;ons pre&s;ent) to the people of Pitt&s;burgh, that they (the people of of Pitt&s;burgh) were not a|bettors of the exci&s;e more than other people, nor did they un|dertake to &s;upport exci&s;e officers more than other people; they left the&s;e matters to the government. But at the &s;ame time it
<PB N="94" REF="028332_0291_0FD898C8F556F3F8">
was a very different matter, not to &s;upport, and to oppo&s;e; that be this as it might, we did not come as delegates from the town, but as individuals, and it would be of no u&s;e for us to join in &s;uch a propo&s;ition, for it would not bind, as we repre|&s;ented nobody. That he, M. Brackenridge, had no objection to give his own opinion in the&s;e matters; that what was done, would be con&s;trued trea&s;on; it might be morally right, but it was legally wrong, and would &s;ubject tho&s;e concerned to pun|i&s;hment, unle&s;s they had force enough to &s;upport an oppo&s;ition to the laws; the matter mu&s;t terminate in a revolution, or a rebellion; if they had not &s;trength to make it a revolution, it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;t be a rebellion; that that part of the country was but a &s;mall part to undertake &s;uch an object, that they had not even the four we&s;tern counties, or neighbouring counties of Penn|&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lvania, nor the three counties of Virginia, nor Kentucky, if that could be of any u&s;e; and that the undertaking affords no rational pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s. That the ca&s;e was not de&s;perate; an accommodation might be brought about with government, and that it would be much better for tho&s;e not involved, to re|main &s;o, as they would have more weight in their repre&s;entations as advocates, than if involved them&s;elves; and could with pro|priety come forward as a mediating party between government and them. That there was rea&s;on to conceive government would not be ra&s;h in taking vigourous mea&s;ures; that the militia mu&s;t be drafted; that there would be a reluctance in the militia of Penn&s;ylvania to &s;erve, and perhaps of the neighbouring &s;tates; that the Pre&s;ident would reflect on this, and be di&s;po&s;ed to an accommodation; that taking into view the di&s;po&s;ition of the Pre&s;ident, from what we had &s;een in the ca&s;e of the Briti&s;h &s;poil|ations, it was a natural conclu&s;ion that he would not wi&s;h to involve the country in war; and his conduct al&s;o with re&s;pect to the Indian tribes in treating with them, to a degree that has been blamed, when war had been thought better, gave rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> would not be ha&s;ty in u&s;ing rigourous mea|&s;ures in a ca&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">e the pre&s;ent. That the late in&s;tance of his l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ity in the ca&s;e of the Pre&s;qu'i&s;le e&s;tabli&s;hment, to which the letters of C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">planter had put a &s;top, manife&s;ted the &s;ame thing. Here Mr. Brackenridge indulged &s;ome plea&s;antry on the appre|hen&s;ions of government in this ca&s;e, and created a laugh. In this and &s;everal parts of the &s;peech, where Mr. Brackenridge indulged a vein of plea&s;antry and humour, this deponent &s;aw through it, and thought that it manife&s;ted a great degree of man|agement and addre&s;s, to play with the fancy of the people, and
<PB N="95" REF="028332_0292_0FD898CA349FDCE0">
divert them from that intentne&s;s, in having the propo&s;ition car|ried, which he was endeavouring to parry. The re&s;ult was, Mr. Brackenridge &s;eemed to <HI>wi&s;h that all things &s;hould remain as they were, and be put in a train of negociation.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. Brackenridge's &s;peech ended; a pau&s;e en&s;ued; mo&s;t of the members of the meeting left the meeting hou&s;e for a &s;hort period of time. On being de&s;ired to re&s;ume their &s;eats, we thought it mo&s;t prudent to retreat, Mr. Brackenridge telling us, "we had better get off as &s;oon as we can, or they will bring us into &s;ome other di&s;agreeable predicament."</P>
<P>This deponent went with Mr. Brackenridge, came away with him, had an opportunity of &s;eeing him through the whole of the time, and did not ob&s;erve him to have any private conver&s;ation with any per&s;on there pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>This deponent further &s;aith, that from the nature of his en|gagement with Mr. Brackenridge, he had almo&s;t daily oppor|tunities of hearing his &s;entiments on the &s;tate of affairs in the country. That his &s;entiments were perfectly oppo&s;ed to the violations of the law, and his great object &s;eemed to be, <HI>to re|&s;tore order, get an indemnity for the people, and at the &s;ame time &s;erve the government.</HI></P>
<P>That this deponent knew it to be Mr. Brackenridge's inten|tion, if order could not be re&s;tored, and a war mu&s;t en&s;ue, to leave the country; and at a time, when war appeared to be inevitable, ju&s;t before the meeting at Red &s;tone, Mr. Brackenridge employed this deponent to go to the country, to collect money for the purpo&s;e of leaving the country, and tak|ing his family with him. <HI>That before this time on other occa&s;ions, he had heard Mr. Brackenridge talk of having the country, to get quit of the troubles, and that the place he meant to retire to, was Philadelphia. That he thought tho&s;e people peculiarly fortunate who had been &s;ent away, and wi&s;hed him&s;elf in their &s;ituation. Mr. Brackenridge expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to this deponent to this effect, before colonel Pre&s;ly Neville went away, and wondered at his being di&s;|&s;atisfied at being &s;ent away, as he ought rather to con&s;ider it as a fortunate circum&s;tance to be clear of the difficulties of the times;</HI> for if a man went of him&s;elf, he would be con&s;idered as a de&s;er|ter, and his property de&s;troyed, or perhaps him&s;elf apprehend|ed in going away, and brought back to puni&s;hment. Whereas when &s;ent away, it was the act of the people them&s;elves, and they could not blame the per&s;on for going. At the meeting at Mingo creek, this deponent recollects that a letter was read from colonel Pre&s;ly Neville, but does not recollect the contents
<PB N="96" REF="028332_0293_0FD898CBF139F590">
preci&s;ely; but to the be&s;t of this deponent's recollection, it re|lated to general Neville, major Kirkpatrick, major Craig, and colonel Neville him&s;elf, with a view of placing their conduct in a favourable light.</P>
<P><HI>Que&s;tion</HI> to the deponent by Mr. Brackenridge. What do you mean when you &s;ay that I was apprehen&s;ive the per&s;ons &s;ent away, would not from the temper of their minds &s;ee things in a proper point of view, being under the influence of chagrin? being under the influence of pa&s;&s;ion, they would be di&s;po&s;ed to &s;tate things more &s;trongly on that account, explain this?</P>
<P><HI>An&s;wer.</HI> In the cour&s;e of the conver&s;ation at that time, this deponent under&s;tood M. Brackenridge, that it would be natu|ral for the&s;e per&s;ons to wi&s;h a force &s;ent at all events, and as it might alarm the government to be under the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;end|ing a large force, they would be di&s;po&s;ed to repre&s;ent it as &s;up|pre&s;&s;ible by a &s;mall force. Whereas in Mr. Brackenridge's o|pinion, the policy would be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> accommodation in the fir&s;t place, and if that &s;hould &s;ail, an efficient force; his ob&s;ervations were to that effect.</P>
<P>At the meeting at Mingo creek, this deponent recollects that at the time Mr. Brackenridge was expre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf with re|gard to the probability of an accommodation with government, he declared <HI>that he him&s;elf would be willing to be one to go to the executive, for the purpo&s;e of obtaining terms.</HI></P>

<SALUTE>Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I received yours of 13th in&s;tant, reque&s;ting me to &s;end you a &s;tatement of what pa&s;&s;ed at Pitt&s;burgh, between the committee that waited upon colonel Baird, Mr. Meetkirk, and my&s;elf, at the time we took over the mail which was intercepted on the road to Philadelphia.</P>
<P>For your &s;atisfaction, I &s;hall &s;tate to you the whole of the bu&s;ine&s;s as preci&s;ely as I can recollect, which is as follows, viz. On the 29th or 30th July la&s;t I came home to my hou&s;e, after being out on the frontiers about ten days. I had &s;carcely di&s;|mounted, before a me&s;&s;enger waited on me from the court-hou&s;e, informing me to attend at a meeting of a large number of the people there a&s;&s;embled. I attended, and found Mr. James Ro&s;s reading &s;ome letters which had been taken out of the mail, which had been intercepted going to Philadelphia. I was there informed that previous to the meeting, there had been or|ders or letters &s;ent among the people to attend at Braddock's field, but for what purpo&s;e I could not then tell; but the order or letters being countermanded by the per&s;ons that for|warded them, which I believe was attending at the meeting, they made every effect to di&s;&s;uade the people to attend, but to no effect; they got the alarm, and wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> determined to go for|ward next day. The &s;ame evening, I believe, I was at Mr. Meetkirk's, when I told I had ju&s;t received a letter from gene|ral Wilkins, reque&s;ting me to be be open next day. Mr. Bradford being pre&s;ent, reque&s;ted me take over part of the intercepted mail, my reply was that I would not; if I received the whole I would take charge of it. He told me the part I had to take was of con&s;equence, as there was money in &s;ome of the letters; and the part remaining was only &s;ome letters which were con&s;idered to be obnoxious, as the writers were conceived to be enemies to this country. I refu&s;ed taking them in part. The next morning colonel James Mar&s;hall met me in the &s;treet, and reque&s;ted me to take the mail. I con&s;ented; we went to Mr. Bradford's, and received it. Mr. Meetkirk
<PB N="98" REF="028332_0295_0FD898D22FB21158">
received the loo&s;e letters. He, Baird, and my&s;elf, volunteer|ed this bu&s;ine&s;s; we then &s;tarted to Pitt&s;burgh, in company with Mr. Henry Purviance, and Mr. Holling&s;worth, who brought me the letter alluded to from general Wilkins, the evening before. On the way where the road turns off to Braddock's field from the Pitt&s;burgh road, about eleven miles from this town, we were a&s;ked, which way? as we there had to move forward, and they took the right, we an&s;wered, To Pitt&s;burgh. We were threatened by a Mr. Lock to have us &s;topped, but we treated him with comtempt, and went on. When we arrived at Pitt&s;burgh, by the time we were di&s;mounted, we were encircled by number of the inhabitants, a&s;king the news; among the re&s;t was Mr. Edward Day; he enquired if the mail was &s;afe. I told him I believed it was, and that I had it in my &s;addle bags. He &s;aid there was a letter of his to Baltimore, of con&s;equence, I an&s;wered I did not know. But there was one directed to Mr. Alexander Hamilton, &s;ecretary of the trea&s;ury, without a &s;ignature to it, which was one of the obnoxious let|ters, and I believed to be his hand writing. We then turned off without any more que&s;tions. By this time the landlord took our hor&s;es, and we went up &s;tairs. Shortly afterwards, gen|eral Wilkins, George Wallace, e&s;q. and your&s;elf came in, and introduced your&s;elves to us, as a committee appointed by the town meeting, which was then &s;itting, to have the news; at the &s;ame time telling us, that there was at that time a town meeting, in con&s;equence of news they had received from the country, viz. the meeting at Braddock's fields next day. We produced the letters which were con&s;idered to be obnoxious. They were read, and this committee were told by us to make what u&s;e they might think proper of them, until to morrow, as we had engaged to have them at Braddock's field next day. Your committee returned, as I under&s;tood, to the town meet|ing, and made report. Your committee waited on us &s;oon afterwards, wi&s;hing us to point out in writing the characters that mu&s;t be expelled. The names was given by us, which was a very delicate thing with us. But to &s;ave your town from de&s;truction, we gave in writing the per&s;ons names, which ought to be expelled for the &s;afety of the place, viz. major Kirkpatrick, Mr. Bri&s;on, and Mr. Day. I remember to men|tion to your committee, that we had no real bu&s;ine&s;s at that time, but to &s;ave your town. And if you did not comply with what was related, by the Lord, <HI>your town, as I believed, would be laid in a&s;hes, and tho&s;e per&s;ons probably ma&s;&s;acred.</HI> I re|member

<P><HI>An&s;wer.

As it appeared your committee waited on us to get the news, and make report to your town meeting; which I under|&s;tood was then &s;itting. <HI>Colonel Pre&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y Neville was pre&s;ent the mo&s;t of the time,</HI> with whom we had &s;ome conver&s;ation, which I do not recollect. In the mean time, you may make u&s;e of this letter in any manner you may think proper. I don't care what con&s;truction may be put on my conduct, by any man, or &s;et of men.

<P>P. S.

<P>Having been forced by &s;ome circum&s;tances to remain in Pitt&s;|burgh during the time of the di&s;turbances which have lately a|gitated that country, I was pre&s;ent at a town meeting, which was convocated upon the news of a large party of country peo|ple a&s;&s;embled at a place called Braddock's fields, who&s;e intention was to come to town the next day, to lay their hands upon &s;e|veral people of Pitt&s;burgh, and to de&s;troy the place if they &s;hould meet with any re&s;i&s;tance; and I heard the di&s;cour&s;e held by Mr. Brackenridge on that in&s;tance, <HI>in which he contrived to per&s;uade the intere&s;ted per&s;ons to quit the town,</HI> in the &s;horte&s;t time, <HI>to &s;ave the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters">es</HI> and the people from the danger<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> which

<P>This deponent recollects, that not long after the beginning of the late di&s;turbances, Mr. Brackenridge read to him a letter he had received from a gentleman of Philadelphia, in an&s;wer to a|nother one he had written fir&s;t to that gentleman, who&s;e con|tents Mr. Brackenridge had mentioned in &s;ub&s;tance to this de|ponent, who remembers that, among&s;t other things, Mr. Brack|enridge told him, he had written to this &s;aid gentleman of Phi|ladelphia (which he told me &s;ince was of the name of Tench Coxe) to wit, that government had perhaps as much rea&s;on of <HI>being afraid of the we&s;tern people, as the we&s;tern people had of fearing government; that &s;hould a few hundreds of the we&s;tern in|&s;urgents attempt to pa&s;s over the mountains, thou&s;ands greatly di&s;|plea&s;ed at the funding &s;y&s;tem and its effects, would immediately

flock with the former ones, and like a torrent would increa&s;e more and more, in their rapid cour&s;e towards the &s;eat of government.</HI> This deponent declares, that this idea &s;o &s;ugge&s;ted by Mr. Brackenridge, &s;eemed to him rather grounded upon exaggera|tion, at the early period Mr. Brackenridge mentioned to him the contents of this letter to Mr. Tench Coxe; but having been informed &s;ince by the mo&s;t undoubtful reports; the di&s;|content that had pervailed through the minds of a con&s;iderable number of people, in the counties of Bedford, Cumberland, Franklin, Northumberland, and in &s;ome parts of Maryland, &amp;c. this deponent is at pre&s;ent fully per&s;uaded, had the leaders of the in&s;urgents thought of &s;uch mea&s;ures, and given execu|tion to it, that what &s;eemed to him an exaggeration at the fir&s;t, might have been literally a fact, and con&s;iders that the <HI>hint Mr. Brackenridge had &s;o ju&s;tly given of the impending danger, to a gen|tleman near government, mu&s;t have been of a great u&s;e to the exe|cutive, if ju&s;tly appreciated.</HI> The deponent &s;ays, that Mr. Tench Coxe by his an&s;wer to the one of Mr. Brackenridge, Mr. Brackenridge did repeatedly &s;ay to this deponent, that Mr. Tench Coxe had not under&s;tood him upon many things he had expre&s;&s;ed to Mr. Tench Coxe, to &s;ecure him&s;elf in ca&s;e his letter had been intercepted on this &s;ide the mountain. La&s;tly, the deponent declares, that he knows Mr. Brackenridge &s;ince more than ten years; that during that period of time he has cultivated his acquaintance without interruption, as a literary and a philo&s;ophic man. That although he &s;poke &s;eldom with him on political &s;ubjects, neverthele&s;s from &s;ome conver&s;ations he had with him relating to politics, and from other circum|&s;tances, the &s;aid deponent has been and is &s;trongly impre&s;&s;ed with the idea, that Mr. Brackenridge is <HI>a warm and a zealous &s;upporter of the pre&s;ent federal con&s;titution, a real friend to the union</HI>; and from &s;ome former in&s;tances, the deponent further &s;ays, that he thinks Mr. Brackenridge is even an admirer of the federal con&s;titution, or at the lea&s;t has been &s;o perhaps in a great|er degree, than many other per&s;ons from this part of the coun|try, who bare very de&s;ervedly in the opinion of this deponent the name of good citizens.</P>

<SALUTE>Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>You de&s;ire me to detail the circum&s;tances which led to the expul&s;ion of the citizens from Pitt&s;burgh, by the committee of battalions on Braddock's fields. As far as it came within my knowledge, I &s;hall do it with plea&s;ure: David Bradford, who &s;eemed to have all the power, and to exerci&s;e it in a very ty|rannical manner, opened the bu&s;ine&s;s by relating the preceeding conduct of the people, the robbing of the mail, and read and commented on the mo&s;t obnoxious letters. He charged the writers with having mi&s;tated the facts, and to have mi&s;repre|&s;ented his conduct, and the conduct of the people to govern|ment. He was warmly &s;upported by many pre&s;ent, who were calling out for liberty, whil&s;t they were violently di&s;po&s;ed to exerci&s;e great tyranny again&s;t tho&s;e who thought differently from them&s;elves.</P>
<P>The writers of the letters had mo&s;t of them mentioned Mr. Bradford's name in an unfavourable manner, which was the cau&s;e of his immediate re&s;entment; and their bani&s;hment was the con&s;equence. The popular fury was &s;ure to be directed a|gain&s;t any man who offended him, during his reign. A motion was made to expel general Gib&s;on, and colonel Neville, who&s;e letters had been intercepted in the mail, again&s;t whom Bradford had previou&s;ly declaimed with great vehemence. It was thought by many people pre&s;ent, friendly to the&s;e two gentlemen, that they might be &s;aved by the que&s;tion of their bani&s;hment being po&s;tponed, until the meeting which was to be &s;oon after, at Parkin&s;on's ferry.</P>
<P>To accompli&s;h this object, a motion was made to refer the ca&s;e of general Gibson to that place. This motion was &s;up|ported by you; but oppo&s;ed and over-ruled by Bradford and o|thers. David Bradford moved in addition to the&s;e two, that major Craig &s;hould be expelled, &s;aying it was reported, that he had offered his hou&s;e for an office of in&s;pection, &s;hould another not be found. Bradford called on the Pitt&s;burgh members, to know if this was true. You an&s;wered it was not true; and

<P>It was determined that the people &s;hould march to Pitt&s;burgh. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">very per&s;on belonging to the town, was under great anxie|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y for their families and property. The town had every thing to fear from a violent mob of armed men, led by a few incon|&s;iderate fools. Previous to the ri&s;ing of the committee, &s;ome of the mo&s;t violent exclaimed that major Kirkpatrick, Mr. Bri|&s;on, and Mr. Day had not gone away; or if they had, it was only for a day or two, and that they would return. The Pitt&s;burgh members, alarmed le&s;t this &s;u&s;picion might induce the mob, when they came to town, to &s;earch for the&s;e gentle|men, not knowing what, the con&s;equence of &s;uch a &s;earch might he, pledged them&s;elves that they were gone, and would not re|turn.</P>
<P>I never heard you expre&s;s a wi&s;h for the bani&s;hment of any individual. I have often heard you &s;ay, that the people had e&s;&s;entially &s;erved tho&s;e they had bani&s;hed; that government would con&s;ider them as martyrs, and reward them.</P>
<P>I remember it was arranged, previous to the election of dele|gates for the meeting to be held at Parkin&s;on's ferry, to choo&s;e tho&s;e who were the mo&s;t friendly to government. You men|tioned to me, that you meant to propo&s;e at the meeting, the &s;ending the commi&s;&s;ioners to the executive, to con&s;ult means of compo&s;ing the di&s;turbances. You expre&s;&s;ed a wi&s;h of being one of the commi&s;&s;ioners your&s;elf. You &s;hewed me an addre&s;s you had drawn up, to be propo&s;ed at the meeting, to be &s;ent to the Pre&s;ident of the United States. You often declared to the, that if the violence continued, you were determined to leave the country, and go to Philadelphia.

<P>Per&s;onally came before me, Alexander Addi&s;on, e&s;q. pre&s;i|dent of the court of common pleas in the fifth di&s;trict of Penn|&s;ylvania, David Reddick e&s;q. prothonotory of the county of Wa&s;hington, and being &s;worn on the holy Evangeli&s;ts of Al|mighty God, &s;aith, that during the late in&s;urrection he conver&s;|ed with Mr. Brackenridge on the &s;ubject of the then prevailing oppo&s;ition to the laws, and that Mr. Brackenridge on all occa|&s;ions di&s;covered to him both his di&s;approbation, and dete&s;tation thereof. Among other things, he recollects Mr. Brackenridge &s;aying, that he con&s;idered it as &s;ound policy, to appear to be with the people, in order to pre&s;erve a &s;ufficient influence to bring them back, when they &s;hould cool down to a certain point, or words to this effect. He further &s;aith, that &s;ome time before the late general election of October la&s;t, he (the deponent) &s;poke both to David Bradford e&s;q. and al&s;o to colonel James Mar&s;hall, on the &s;ubject of electing Mr. Brackenridge to &s;erve in Congre&s;s; each of the&s;e gentlemen declared po&s;itively they would not vote for him; and as the deponent had known them both to be remarkably well affected to Mr. Brackenridge early in the &s;ummer preceeding (at the June court in Pitt&s;burgh), he enquired of them &s;everally, why they had changed their minds. Their an&s;wers were nearly alike, their words are not preci&s;ely recollected, but the purport was, that they <HI>were di&s;obliged with him for the part he had taken in the then late affairs of the country.</HI> The deponent afterwards when mentioning to Mr. Bracken|ridge, that Me&s;&s;rs. Bradford and Mar&s;hall, had altered their de|termination re&s;pecting his election, &s;ince the time they had &s;oli|cited him to con&s;ent to be elected, Mr. Brackenridge replied to the deponent to the following effect. <HI>That he did not wonder at Mr. Bradford being enraged at him, as he con&s;idered him as a weak man; but that he was much &s;urpri&s;ed that colonel Mar&s;hall, who was a man of good &s;en&s;e, could have ever for a moment believ|ed him (Mr. Brackenridge) to be di&s;po&s;ed to u&s;e force again&s;t the government.</HI></P>
<P>Further, this deponent recollects, that on the morning that colonel Blackeney, doctor Baird, and William Meetkirk, e&s;q. &s;et out for Pitt&s;burgh with the intercepted mail, he know that all tho&s;e gentlemen of Pitt&s;burgh, who&s;e letters had been found in the mail, unfavourable to what was then commonly called <HI>the cau&s;e</HI> were marked for vengeance. He remembers to have heard by &s;o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> per&s;on (who it was with certainty he cannot &s;ay) that Mr. Scull the printer was a good man, that his letter to

the governor was favourable, but that the others ought not to be permitted to live in the country, or to &s;uch effect. That he recollects well, that he was &s;o anxious at the time for the &s;afety of general Gib&s;on, (who&s;e letter was inoffen&s;ive even if the country cau&s;e had been a good one), and al&s;o for young Neville, who&s;e letter was a private one to his father-in-law; that he &s;poke to doctor Baird on the &s;treet, and he believes to colonel Blackeney al&s;o, de&s;iring them by all means to go to Pitt&s;|burgh (with the mail) and <HI>warn the gentlemen who were thus in danger, of their perilous &s;ituation, as well as that of the town, which was in danger on their account.</HI> The deponent recollects further, in the conver&s;ation with colonel Mar&s;hall, after the colonel's return from Mingo creek meeting, that he told the de|ponent of a letter <HI>which colonel Pre&s;ly Neville had written to that meeting, and &s;poke of it as an in&s;ult to the people.</HI> Further at pre&s;ent he recollects not, but can &s;ay that he never <HI>heard ei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">er colonel Mar&s;hall, Mr. Bradford, or any other per&s;on concerned,</HI> &s;ay hat Mr. Brackenridge <HI>had any previous knowledge, or was concerned in the intercepting the mail, the march to Braddock's field, or any act or acts of violence whatever, either by advice, acquie&s;cence, or otherwi&s;e.</HI></P>

<P>In an&s;wer to a number of queries, I have received from you, I will ob&s;erve, that I well recollect that after the compromi&s;e between Virginia and Penn&s;ylvania, re&s;pecting <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> and juri&s;|diction in this country, and perhaps in the year 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">8<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, a di&s;&s;at|isfaction, not without &s;ymptoms of violence, exi&s;ted on account of the compromi&s;e; and a &s;trong party was formed, who&s;e de|clared de&s;ign was to prevent the compromi&s;e taking effect, by e&s;tabli&s;hing a &s;tate of our own (as it was termed) independent of both Virginia and Penn&s;ylvania. To this propo&s;ition in all its parts and po&s;&s;ible con&s;equences, I know you were oppo&s;ed in word and deed, nor do I doubt my having a correct know|ledge of your &s;entiments on this occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>Again on the publication of the federal con&s;titution, the part you took was, in my e&s;timation, decidedly favourable to its adop|tion; nor have I had any rea&s;on from that day to this, to change this opinion. I believe it is correct.</P>
<P>To the third query, my opportunities of knowing your &s;en|timents, &s;ince the adoption of the federal con&s;titution, have been a continuance of the acquaintance and good degree of inti|macy that had long before exi&s;ted between us. I have often heard you &s;peak on the &s;ubject, not only publicly but private|ly and confidentially. I have ob&s;erved your actions to corre&s;|pond with your words; and upon the whole, have never di&s;|covered a di&s;po&s;ition on your part, to di&s;turb or overthrow the government of the United States; far otherways; nor has common fame, properly &s;o called, ever expre&s;&s;ed &s;uch an opin|ion of you in my hearing, altho' &s;ome individuals have <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">No individual <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ur had any ground to think &s;o, it mu&s;t have been the malicious or ignorant.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, It is true, I was an inhabitant of the town of Wa&s;h|ington, during the whole of the late di&s;turbance, and &s;eldom went out of it. I was not an inattentive &s;pectator of what
<PB N="116" REF="028332_0313_0FD897A829289348">
was going forward, and I had what I think the be&s;t information from almo&s;t all quarters; and upon all I have collected, the im|pre&s;&s;ion on my mind is, <HI>that you had no privacy with the principal actors in the outrages; that your advice, or promi&s;ed, or expected &s;upport, never encouraged them; but that they rather feared you</HI>&punc; this has been my opinion throughout the whole bu&s;ine&s;s. I have often declared it. It is my opinion now, and will continue &s;o to be, until I have te&s;timony much &s;tronger to the contrary than I yet have.</P>

<P>I take the liberty of making to you a few queries relative to my&s;elf, in the tran&s;action of the late in&s;urrection in this coun|try, your an&s;wer to which will oblige me.</P>
<P N="1">1<HI>&s;t.</HI> Were you not in the town of Wa&s;hington at the time of the return of individuals to that place who had been at the meeting at Mingo creek; and what was the impre&s;&s;ion which &s;eemed to have been made on their minds with re&s;pect to what was &s;aid by me at that meeting was it that of having &s;upported or evaded the propo&s;ition of Bradford, and the mea|&s;ures propo&s;ed by the more violent?</P>
<P N="2">2<HI>d.</HI> At what point of the bu&s;ine&s;s did you come forward, and was pre&s;ent in the committee of battallions on Braddock's field; and what was the impre&s;&s;ion on your mind with re&s;pect to my conduct in the ca&s;e of Neville, Gib&s;on, and Craig; and what do you recollect, or is your impre&s;&s;ion with re&s;pect to our engagement, I mean tho&s;e of the committee from Pitt&s;burgh, with regard to Abraham Kirkpatrick, and others that had been &s;ent away; did we not pledge our per&s;ons for theirs, that they had gone and would not return; and did not this &s;tipulation ap|pear to you to be the re&s;ult of nece&s;&s;ity at that juncture, to al|lay the rage of the people again&s;t the town, on account of tho&s;e per&s;ons?</P>
<P N="3">3<HI>d.</HI> Shortly after the day of Braddock's field, do you recollect my &s;tating to you the delicacy of my &s;ituation, and wi&s;h to ex|tricate my&s;elf from it; that I had thought of procuring my&s;elf
<PB N="117" REF="028332_0314_0FD897AA15945E48">
to be &s;ent to the executive, on behalf of the people of Pitt&s;burg, to repre&s;ent their &s;ituation, and the motives of their conduct; and having done this, not to return; that with this view I wi&s;h|ed you to found &s;ome principal per&s;ons, and &s;ee whither it would &s;eem that I could be &s;o appointed; and did you not give me in|formation afterwards, that you had founded, and found an un|willingne&s;s that I &s;hould leave the town or the country, but ra|ther remain, in order to a&s;&s;i&s;t in ways of our general &s;afety?</P>
<P N="4">4<HI>th.</HI> Before the election of delegates for the town of Pitt&s;|burgh to the meeting at Parkin&s;on's ferry, did I not expre&s;s to you my determination of not &s;uffering my name to be mention|ed as a delegate, recollecting with what difficulty I had extricat|ed my&s;elf at the Mingo meeting hou&s;e; that it would be better, in order to &s;ave appearances on the part of the town, to let &s;ome per&s;on go forward who would not be expected to &s;peak, or take any con&s;picuous part in the bu&s;ine&s;s: Was it not rather your opinion, that it was a turning point of the bu&s;ine&s;s to get for|ward as many as po&s;&s;ible of moderation, addre&s;s, ability, and influence, in order to parry the de&s;perate mea&s;ures that might be propo&s;ed; and did you not undertake to go to Wa&s;hington, and accompli&s;h, as far as in your power, the procuring per&s;ons to be elected of that de&s;cription; and was it not upon this ground that I acquie&s;ced, and changed my determination?</P>
<P N="5">5<HI>th.</HI> At the meeting of Parkin&s;on's ferry, did I not explain to you the plan I had devi&s;ed, which was that of &s;ending com|mi&s;&s;ioners to the executive; and did not I &s;hew you an addre&s;s I had prepared to the Pre&s;ident, &s;uch as I thought the people would be willing to &s;end; but the commi&s;&s;ioners &s;ent would ex|po&s;e the real &s;tate of the country, and devi&s;e mea&s;ures for the pacification of it; and did not I &s;ugge&s;t to you, that the obtain|ing an amne&s;ty for what was done, would be the means; tho&s;e that were de&s;perate, from a &s;en&s;e of the violation of the law, &s;ee|ing then a pro&s;pect of &s;afety, or a way of getting out; and did you not, with my con&s;ent, take this addre&s;s to read over, and &s;hew it to the commi&s;&s;ioners; as it would give them the &s;ame in|formation which was intended for the Pre&s;ident?</P>
<P N="6">6<HI>th.</HI> At Parkin&s;on's ferry, towards the clo&s;e of the bu&s;ine&s;s, at what was con&s;idered a delicate cri&s;is, when it was agitated whether the commi&s;&s;ioners who had been announced as having arrived, &s;hould come forward to the people there pre&s;ent, or a delegation be made of per&s;ons to confer with them at a &s;epar|ate place; and was it not con&s;idered by us, that the coming forward there would be fatal, as whatever propo&s;itions were
<PB N="118" REF="028332_0315_0FD897AB11D8D900">
brought forward, would probably at this in&s;tant be rejected by the multitude; and when &s;everal &s;peakers of the moderate de&s;|cription &s;eemed to have failed in advocating a &s;eparate confer|ence, was I not called upon by you, and addre&s;&s;ed in the&s;e words, "This is the turning point; you mu&s;t now &s;peak." I had a con&s;iderable time before that left the circle, and was walk|ing at &s;ome di&s;tance from the croud. Did I not inform you, that I de&s;paired of it, &s;o many others having &s;poke in vain; you &s;aid, I could do it.

<SALUTE>Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>Want of time before you leave this place, prevents my an|&s;wering your queries of this day &s;o fully as I could wi&s;h, but I &s;hall endeavour to &s;tate as conci&s;ely as po&s;&s;ible, my recollection of the facts to which they are pointed.</P>
<P>I lived in Wa&s;hington at the time general Neville's hou&s;e was de&s;troyed, and during the time of the late di&s;turbances. On the return of the Wa&s;hington gentlemen from the Mingo creek meeting, I under&s;tood from them that a propo&s;al had been made in the meeting, that tho&s;e guilty of the outrage &s;hould be &s;up|ported by force again&s;t all attempts to puni&s;h them, and that this had been warmly advocated by &s;ome of our Wa&s;hington people; but <HI>that you were of a different opinion, and had &s;tated, that in all probability the government might be induced to forgive it, and that a combination of this &s;ort would involve the whole country, and oblige government to take notice of tho&s;e who had tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed.</HI> This meeting ended by a propo&s;al to have a more general one
<PB N="119" REF="028332_0316_0FD897AC7751D5B0">
from the four counties we&s;t of the mountains in Penn&s;ylvania, and, as I under&s;tood, the we&s;tern counties of Virginia, were to be notified to attend on the 14th of Augu&s;t at Parkin&s;on's fer|ry. Before this day arrived, the mail was robbed, &s;everal ob|noxious letters were found in it; a project for taking the pub|lic arms, ammunition and &s;tores at Pitt&s;burgh, was &s;et on foot; this plan al&s;o embraced the &s;eizing and puni&s;hing in an exem|plary manner, the writers of tho&s;e letters, who were called traitors to their country; and the militia were called to a&s;&s;em|ble at Braddock's field, and to march from thence to Pitt&s;burgh.</P>
<P>The names of tho&s;e publickly denounced in Wa&s;hington, in pre&s;ence of the troops (who were he&s;itating whether they would march, or not) were Thomas Butler, Abraham Kirkpa|trick, John Gib&s;on, James Bri&s;on, and Edward Day. When the troops were a&s;&s;embled at Braddock's field, a large commit|tee was appointed to con&s;ider and &s;ettle what &s;hould be done. This committee &s;at a long time, and the &s;oldiers became clamo|rous for a march to Pitt&s;burgh. At this time I came to the committee, who were at &s;ome di&s;tance from the main body. I then learned that the de&s;ign of attacking the fort was abandon|ed; that the committee had re&s;olved to petition the Pre&s;ident for the removal of colonel Butler from the command of the fort; that they had ordered the bani&s;hment of major Kirkpatrick, Mr. Bri&s;on, and Mr. Day; and they were taking the que&s;tion whe|ther colonel Neville, and general Gib&s;on &s;hould not be bani&s;h|ed. John Wilkins and you, made a propo&s;al to po&s;tpone their bani&s;hment until the meeting of the 14th Augu&s;t; but this was negatived. I am not certain whether this propo&s;al was confin|ed to the&s;e la&s;t named gentlemen, or extended to all, but ra|ther think Neville and Gib&s;on only included. One of the com|mittee then denounced major Craig, for having &s;aid he would keep an in&s;pection office in his own hou&s;e, rather than the ex|ci&s;e law &s;hould be defeated. A good deal was &s;aid on this &s;ub|ject; his expul&s;ion was at la&s;t prevented by a propo&s;al of yours, that a petition &s;hould be &s;ent to general Knox for his removal. It being very que&s;tionable whether Butler would not protect him in the fort, as belonging to the army; and at all events the public bu&s;ine&s;s would &s;uffer from the want of a proper offi|cer to take care of the military &s;tores. This was agreed to. The time within which the bani<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hed men mu&s;t depart was fixed, and pa&s;&s;ports allowed them. <HI>The Pitt&s;burgh committee men were called upon to pledge them&s;elves for the full execution of the re&s;olu|tions, which they did; but whether their own per&s;ons were pledged
<PB N="120" REF="028332_0317_0FD897ADF4EEACA8">
or not, I do not recollect.</HI> After this was &s;ettled, one of the Wa&s;hington members ro&s;e, and propo&s;ed that the troops &s;hould march home through Pitt&s;burgh, and that they &s;hould all go in a body; profe&s;&s;ing his belief that they would do no harm, and &s;tating, that the news of five thou&s;and men having marched through that place, would &s;trike terror into the minds of all be|low, who might dream of puni&s;hing any thing that had been done. From the fir&s;t of the meeting at Braddock's field until this time, it had been my opinion, that we could prevail with the troops to go home from thence; but finding a great major|ity of the committee for marching to town, I doubted of the practicability of preventing them, and it was evidently the be&s;t policy to carry the well di&s;po&s;ed along with the violent, in or|der to controul them.</P>
<P>This was the opinion of all the well di&s;po&s;ed part of the peo|ple a&s;&s;embled there, and accordingly the unarmed, as well as the armed, were put in the ranks and proceeded to Pitt&s;burgh. The&s;e expul&s;ions, and this march, were the re&s;ult of the meet|ing at Braddock's field; and <HI>nothing but the apparent con&s;ent of the Pitt&s;burgh people to all the&s;e mea&s;ures, could have &s;aved their property from utter de&s;truction.</HI> Almo&s;t all the inhabitants of the town were at the field, and expre&s;&s;ed to me their de&s;pair of &s;aving the town, provided the in&s;urgents marched into it. You exerted your&s;elf, among&s;t others, to the utmo&s;t, in order to prevent this mea&s;ure. But when it was re&s;olved on, in my o|pinion, no per&s;on who wi&s;hed the &s;afety of the place, would ei|ther have oppo&s;ed the march by force, or &s;ent home the peace|able well di&s;po&s;ed part of the militia.</P>
<P>The facts mentioned in your third, fourth, fifth, and &s;ixth queries, are, to the be&s;t of my recollection, correctly &s;tated. I may forget words; but the impre&s;&s;ions made on me, and &s;enti|ments expre&s;&s;ed by you, are &s;ub&s;tantially as there &s;tated; and it would be only a wa&s;te of time to repeat the &s;everal &s;ubjects there alluded to. <HI>I &s;aw many alarmed, and anxious for the &s;afe|ty of their country, for the re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of the government,</HI> and who expre&s;&s;ed an abhorence of all that was doing. I thought none of them more &s;eriou&s;ly &s;o than your&s;elf; and when you came as a committee man to &s;ettle the terms of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, I am per&s;uaded there is none will deny that you exerted your&s;elf to get every rea&s;onable conce&s;&s;ion on the part of the govern|ment, in favour of your con&s;tituents.</P>
<P>Finally, Sir, <HI>there is no impre&s;&s;ion on my mind, from any part of your conduct in the late di&s;turbances, which I have &s;een, nor
<PB N="121" REF="028332_0318_0FD897B321189C48">
from any thing I have heard you &s;ay, that you attempted in any in&s;tance to inflame the minds of any of the people again&s;t an indi|vidual, or to turn the force of others again&s;t a private enemy.</HI></P>

<DIV3 TYPE="statement">
<P>In an&s;wer to certain queries propo&s;ed to me by Hugh Hen|ry Brackenrldge, e&s;q. I can certify, and were it nece&s;&s;ary at this time, could depo&s;e, as follows:</P>
<P>I re&s;ided at Wa&s;hington during the di&s;turbances which late|ly took place in the four we&s;tern counties of Penn&s;ylvania, but was occa&s;ionally at &s;ome of the public meetings, which were held in different parts of the &s;ame, in con&s;equence of tho&s;e di&s;|turbances. I have had frequent opportunities of ob&s;erving the conduct of tho&s;e who were mo&s;t con&s;picuous in exciting the commotions, but never had the lea&s;t rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect him of any <HI>privity or concert with tho&s;e leaders.</HI> On the contrary, from the period of my fir&s;t conver&s;ation with him on the &s;ubject, which was on the evening that the intercepted mail was carried from Wa&s;hington to Pitt&s;burgh, throughout the whole of the tran&s;actions, he expre&s;&s;ed uniformly to me &s;entiments in oppo|&s;ition to the violence and outrages which were taking place. My communications with him were frequent; and I am per|&s;uaded with the mo&s;t perfect confidence and &s;incerity on his part. Some were made in company with James Ro&s;s, e&s;q. and others without the pre&s;ence of any third per&s;on; but in either &s;i|tuation, was that of a &s;trong di&s;approbation of the madne&s;s and folly which had taken place.</P>
<P>On the morning that the intercepted mail was brought to Wa&s;hington, immediately on hearing of it I went to Mr. Brad|ford's hou&s;e, and in a few words reque&s;ted him to explain to me the meaning of what I had heard. His reply to me was, "We have di&s;covered that there are traitors and ari&s;tocrats (this I think was the language, for it made a &s;trong impre&s;|&s;ion on me) who are forming &s;chemes to trample upon the liberties of the people;" and other conver&s;ation to that effect, immaterial to be related. I a&s;ked him who they were, and what had been di&s;covered. He an&s;wered, that there was a cer|tain Mr. Day, and a certain Mr. Bri&s;on, al&s;o a certain general Gib&s;on, who did not &s;tand very fair, and that Pre&s;ly Neville had not behaved very well. I may err as to the preci&s;e words,
<PB N="122" REF="028332_0319_0FD897B3F849FD08">
but am pretty certain as to the &s;ub&s;tance, and as to the per&s;ons above mentioned. The letters were not &s;hewn to me by Mr. Bradford, nor did he proceed to detail to me, what the partic|ulars of the di&s;covery were. The letters were read the &s;ame day at a town-meeting in Wa&s;hington; and al&s;o the next day, and the writers of them denounced as ari&s;tocrats, and de&s;erv|ing puni&s;hment.</P>
<P>When I went in company with tho&s;e who carried the mail from Wa&s;hington to Pitt&s;burgh, which was the day previous to the a&s;&s;emblage of the people at Braddock's fields, I certainly apprehended <HI>great danger of mi&s;chief to the town, and al&s;o to the per&s;ons who&s;e letters had occa&s;ioned the &s;ummoning of the people to Braddock's field.</HI> My opinion was, that the be&s;t mode of avert|ing this danger was, for tho&s;e people them&s;elves to retire. General Gib&s;on and colonel Neville can perhaps remember my communicating to them my &s;entiments to this effect. Tho' I felt all its har&s;hne&s;s with re&s;pect to the individual<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> them&s;elves, who were this obliged to relinqui&s;h their families and country, I compared it with what appeared to me the very probable dan|gerous con&s;equences, which were to re&s;ult <HI>to the per&s;ons, and property of tho&s;e per&s;ons,</HI> and of the inhabitants of Pitt&s;burgh, from their omitting to do &s;o.</P>
<P>I was pre&s;ent at the conference between the gentlemen who took the intercepted mail to Pitt&s;burgh, and the delegates from the town-meeting of that place, then &s;itting. As well as I can recollect, colonel Neville was there, if not all the time, cer|tainly a part of it, and while the bu&s;ine&s;s on which the former had come was explained, which was done in a few words, and the letters which have been mentioned were &s;hewn.</P>
<P>The gentlemen from Wa&s;hington at this conference, certain|ly omitted to mention the names of general Gib&s;on and colon|el Neville, as per&s;ons obnoxious on account of their letters, as being in per&s;onal danger; or that their removal was nece&s;|&s;ary for the &s;afety of the town. My rea&s;on for remembering this is, <HI>that I was a&s;toni&s;hed at the omi&s;&s;ion;</HI> and felt the great|e&s;t apprehen&s;ions for the&s;e two gentlemen, and con&s;idered them as in danger if they &s;hould be kept ignorant of their real &s;itua|tion. I al&s;o was alarmed for the &s;afety of the town, if the mea&s;ure recommended by the gentlemen who carried the mail, and by my&s;elf al&s;o, viz. "That tho&s;e who&s;e letters had ren|dered them obnoxious &s;hould retire," was not adopted as to the whole of them.</P>
<P>I refrained with &s;ome difficulty from mentioning it to colonel
<PB N="123" REF="028332_0320_0FD897B637B89660">
Neville, and was per&s;uaded <HI>that a very dangerous delicacy to|wards him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> account of his pre&s;ence, and no other <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> had prevented the mention of his name.</HI> I al&s;o felt my&s;elf in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;itua|tion too delicate to interfere thus far <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> bu&s;ine&s;s; as I had on|ly gone to Pitt&s;burgh accidentally, in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> had the cu&s;tody of the mail, and was not con&s;idered as one to whom the bu&s;ine&s;s was in any degree committed. My unea&s;i|ne&s;s however increa&s;ed &s;o much during the evening, that I de|termined to interfere for what I conceived to be the &s;afety of the town, as well as of <HI>general Gib&s;on and colonel Neville. I cal|led upon Mr. Brackenridge at near</HI> 12 <HI>o'clock that &s;ame night;</HI> told him of the omi&s;&s;ion, and my opinion of its con&s;equences. He immediately proceeded to call together as many of the mem|bers of the town committee as could be procured. This was done. They met at his hou&s;e in perhaps an hour and a half; and I then communicated to them what I have above &s;tated to have been omitted, <HI>and I think that I al&s;o mentioned major Craig as one in &s;imiliar circum&s;tances with the other two gentlemen,</HI> and told them my opinion of the con&s;equences. It is my belief that it was &s;olely in con&s;equence of my interfering in this manner, that tho&s;e gentlemen fir&s;t came to know that they were con&s;id|ered as in danger, and that general Gib&s;on and colonel Neville were informed of their being con&s;idered as obnoxious. What took place at Braddock's fields the next day in the committee, confirmed my opinion of the night before, with re&s;pect to them.</P>
<P>I certainly did not ob&s;erve in Mr. Brackenridge at any time during the bu&s;ine&s;s, the <HI>lea&s;t &s;ymptom of ill will, or a malignant di&s;po&s;ition towards tho&s;e two gentlemen la&s;t mentioned.</HI> I remem|ber &s;hortly after the above tran&s;action, &s;omething like the fol|lowing to have taken place between Mr. Brackenridge and my|&s;elf: I mentioned to him (in con&s;equence of my having frequent|ly heard that he was on bad terms, if not with colonel Neville, <HI>with &s;ome of the connections of the family</HI>) that it was probable the bani&s;hment of colonel Neville, and perhaps I might have mentioned the burning of general Neville's property, would by &s;ome be attributed to his means. He replied, that he &s;uppo&s;ed it might be &s;o, but that it would be a great mi&s;take; for if <HI>he had meant to &s;erve them, he could not do it more effectually than by &s;uch conduct; that it would make their fortunes, as the govern|ment would certainly pay them well for all lo&s;s or injury.</HI></P>
<P>My opinion of his conduct in public at the Red&s;tone meet|ing, when the terms of accommodation propo&s;ed by the commi&s;|&s;ioners were di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, was, that it was influenced by the &s;in|cere&s;t
<PB N="124" REF="028332_0321_0FD897B7D0EE07B8">
de&s;ire to procure the acce&s;&s;ion of that committee to the terms propo&s;ed; and his &s;peech on that occa&s;ion, contained the mo&s;t unequivocal declarations of his &s;en&s;e of the propriety and nece&s;&s;ity of accepting them.</P>
<P>In private I do not recollect to have had any communication with him at that time, or to have made any remarks upon his conduct or conver&s;ation out of the committee.</P>
<P>At Braddock's field, as at Red&s;tone, I had little communica|tion with Mr. Brackenridge. He was engaged as a member of the committee, and of cour&s;e principally taken up with tho&s;e who were mo&s;t immediately concerned in the tran&s;actions of the day. I rode in company with him from Pitt&s;burgh to Brad|dock's field, on the day that the inhabitants of the town went to meet the people there a&s;&s;embled, and had &s;ome conver&s;ation with him on the road relative to the bu&s;ine&s;s; in which conver|&s;ation his mind appeared to me &s;trongly <HI>impre&s;&s;ed with the a|larming &s;ituation of this country, and his &s;entiments and intentions to be &s;uch as I wi&s;hed to find them.</HI> My opinion of his conduct on that day, formed partly from my &s;ub&s;equent conver&s;ation with him&s;elf on the various tran&s;actions of it, and partly from conver&s;ation with James Ro&s;s, e&s;q. and others there pre&s;ent, re&s;pecting the &s;ame is, that it had for its object, the averting danger from the town of Pitt&s;burgh.</P>
<P>My opinion of the whole of his conduct throughout the in&s;ur|rection in this country, I &s;hall give without re&s;erve: It appear|ed to me to have two objects; <HI>to arre&s;t the progre&s;s of the pre|&s;ent violence; and to procure an amne&s;ty for that already commit|ed, and thus prevent the flame from &s;preading beyond that country in which it originated.</HI> Though in &s;ome in&s;tances during the tran&s;actions, my opinion differed from his, with re&s;pect to the mea&s;ures adopted for the accompli&s;hment of particular points, I never entertained any doubt of the propriety of the principle which actuated him.</P>
<P>Whatever may be the &s;olidity or ju&s;tne&s;s of this, or any o|ther opinion I have here given of Mr. Brackenridge's conduct and principles, in the di&s;turbances of the we&s;tern country, I can with &s;afety vouch for the &s;incerity with which it is given, and he is at liberty to make any u&s;e either public or private, of the&s;e &s;entiments in reply to his queries.</P>

<P>I have received your letter, de&s;iring me to &s;tate to you "my knowledge of your &s;entiments and conduct, re&s;pecting the adoption of the federal con&s;titution; and of your di&s;po&s;ition to &s;upport it &s;ince its adoption; and to &s;tate al&s;o whether I have di&s;covered from you, any idea of overthrowing it; or have any rea&s;on to believe that you advi&s;ed or countenanced any ille|gal oppo&s;ition to the exci&s;e law; or had any concern in exciting or &s;upporting the late di&s;turbances."</P>
<P>In making this &s;tatement as &s;incerely and candidly as I can, I &s;hall &s;peak from my ob&s;ervation of your conduct in an acquaint|ance of more than nine years, and in your company in &s;ocial and familiar conver&s;ation at the courts of this circuit, within al|mo&s;t the whole of that time; from my confidence that your conver&s;ation on political &s;ubjects is frank and &s;incere; and from my opportunity of learning the opinions entertained of you by the judges my a&s;&s;ociates, and other re&s;pectable citizens in the &s;everal counties of this circuit.</P>
<P>Your approbation of the federal con&s;titution from its publica|tion, and your exertions to conciliate the minds of the people towards it, and promote its adoption, are notorious. Since its adoption, I believe that you have con&s;tantly retained your re|&s;pect and attachment to it; and I know nothing to induce any &s;u&s;picion of your conceiving an idea of overthrowing it.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible for me, without erazing all my impre&s;&s;ions of your character and conduct, to &s;uppo&s;e that <HI>you ever advi&s;ed or countenanced any illegal oppo&s;ition to the exci&s;e law;</HI> I think your &s;en&s;e of civil duty &s;trong and accurate, and believe you incapa|ble of &s;ugge&s;ting or approving any unlawful act.</P>
<P>During the di&s;turbances here, until the fir&s;t conference with the commi&s;&s;ioners at Pitt&s;burgh, I was ab&s;ent from this coun|try. At the time of that conference you there expre&s;&s;ed to me the utmo&s;t di&s;approbation of the preceeding acts of violence, and regret for their effects; your perfect &s;atisfaction with the terms propo&s;ed by the commi&s;&s;ioners, as the be&s;t that could be offered, and your re&s;olution to exert every endeavour to induce the people to accept of them; and, <HI>if you &s;hould fail, to leave this country.</HI> I am per&s;uaded that you &s;poke your mind, all your &s;ub&s;equent conduct, &s;o far as I ever under&s;tood (and I knew much of it) uniformly corre&s;ponded with tho&s;e declarations; and I believe you contributed greatly to the re&s;toration of peace and civil &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion in this country. It mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed, that the outrages which had been committed, would be frequent &s;ubject

<P>I received your letter of the 13th in&s;tant, and have no doubt but that you are entitled, at lea&s;t, to a full &s;tatement by letter, of your expre&s;&s;ions to me in Pitt&s;burgh; but I much doubt the propriety of voluntarily going before a magi&s;trate, and making a depo&s;ition on the &s;ubject. And as it is an extrajudicial bu&s;i|ne&s;s, I pre&s;ume no magi&s;trate will call upon me by &s;ubpoena, for the purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>I know well you have enemies, and believe they are my friends. I re&s;pect them, and regard you. It is not for me, therefore, on the one hand, by a voluntary act of mine, to lo&s;e my friends, or wound their feelings, even though they be your enemies; nor on the other hand, to retain their friend&s;hip, by
<PB N="127" REF="028332_0324_0FD897BE8BD772C8">
withholding an act of ju&s;tice from you. I have therefore deter|mined to do no more on either &s;ide than &s;trict ju&s;tice, which will be effected by an&s;wering your letter. If any man doubts my words, I pre&s;ume he would not re&s;pect my oath; and I flat|ter my&s;elf, that all who know me will doubt neither.</P>
<P>I recollect perfectly, that on the day I think previous to con|ference being opened in Pitt&s;burgh, between the commi&s;&s;ioners on the part of the United States, and the committee appointed by the deluded people, I entered without re&s;erve into a &s;hort conver&s;ation with you, relative to the &s;ituation of the we&s;tern country. Your &s;entiments I recollect fully coincided with mine on that occa&s;ion. One &s;entiment of yours &s;truck me, as &s;trong|ly characteri&s;tic of your opinion, which was, "<HI>that if the de|&s;igns of individuals, or the ob&s;tinacy of the multitude, &s;hould pre|vent &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the government, you were determined to leave the country; that the con&s;equent &s;acrifice of your property &s;hould not influence you; that the &s;acrifice would probably be but tempora|ry; for that obedience would, and ought to be inforced; that gov|ernment had the power, and no doubt would exert it on that occa|&s;ion.</HI>" One of us mentioned the nece&s;&s;ity of inducing Mr. Brad|ford to comply with the terms which might be propo&s;ed by the commi&s;&s;ioners. I &s;ugge&s;ted the propriety of the u&s;e of your in|fluence with him. You doubted whether you had any; and &s;aid, "<HI>the only way you ever could manage him, was by pretend|ing to anticipate his opinions; and thus per&s;uade him to come into mea&s;ures as his own, than which nothing could be more foreign to his thoughts;</HI> but that you would leave no means une&s;&s;ayed, to effect a change of his mind."</P>
<P>It cannot be expected that I &s;hould now give the words of our conver&s;ation on that occa&s;ion; but I am per&s;uaded I have given the ideas. The belief that you were directly or indirect|ly concerned in the late in&s;urrection can only be entertained by tho&s;e, <HI>who from their di&s;tance from the &s;cene of action have been impo&s;ed upon by mi&s;repre&s;entations, and have therefore formed con|clu&s;ions upon ill founded premi&s;es; or by y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ur enemies, who&s;e pre|judices have totally prevented enquiry.</HI></P>
<P>The dangerous and unpopular part I took in the late in&s;ur|rection, and the dete&s;tation I entertain for all tho&s;e defamatory &s;ocieties, who have for their object the di&s;&s;emination of jealou|&s;ies again&s;t the government; and who, I have no doubt, contri|buted greatly, (perhaps unde&s;ignedly), to the late di&s;honorable in&s;urrection, are, I hope, &s;ufficient pledges of the truth of this &s;tatement, even when it is made in favour of you, who, unfor|tunately

<P>I have received no papers from you; your letter by the po&s;t is the fir&s;t I have heard from you. I take the opportunity to give you, in return, a &s;ummary of the pre&s;ent &s;tate of this coun|try, with re&s;pect to the oppo&s;ition that exi&s;ts to the exci&s;e law. It has its origin not in any antifederal &s;pirit, I a&s;&s;ure you. It is chiefly the principles and operation of the law it&s;elf, that renders it obnoxious. Be this as it may, the facts are the&s;e:</P>
<P>The oppo&s;ition, which for &s;ome time &s;hewed it&s;elf in re&s;olves of committtees, in repre&s;entations to government, in ma&s;ked attacks on in&s;ignificant deputy exci&s;e officers, for only &s;uch would accept the appointment&mdash;did at length, on the appear|ance of the mar&s;hal in this country to &s;erve proce&s;s, break out <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> an open and direct attack on the in&s;pector of the revenue him&s;elf, general Neville. The&s;e circum&s;tances you will by this

time have heard, from the general him&s;elf, and from the mar|&s;hall, major Lenox.</P>
<P>Sub&s;equent to their departure from the country, notice was given of a meeting on the Monongahela river, about eighteen miles from the town of Pitt&s;burgh. Six delegates, of whom I was one, were &s;ent from this town. Nothing material was done at this meeting, but the mea&s;ure agreed upon of a more general meeting, on the 14th of Augu&s;t, near the &s;ame place, to take into view the pre&s;ent &s;tate of affairs of the country.</P>
<P>Sub&s;equent to this, the mail was intercepted, characters in Pitt&s;burgh became obnoxious by letters found, in which &s;enti|ments con&s;trued to evince a bias in favour of the exci&s;e law, were di&s;covered.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of this, it was thought nece&s;&s;ary to demand of the town that tho&s;e per&s;ons &s;hould be delivered up, or expel|led, or any other obnoxious character that might re&s;ide there: al&s;o, that the exci&s;e office &s;till kept in Pitt&s;burgh, or &s;aid to be kept there, &s;hould be pulled down; the hou&s;e of Abraham Kirkpatrick, burnt or pulled down; other hou&s;es al&s;o, that were the property of per&s;ons unfavourable to the cau&s;e. For this purpo&s;e, circular letters were &s;ent to the battalions of the coun|ties, detachments from which met on Braddock's field, to the amount of at lea&s;t five thou&s;and men, on the 2d of the month. It was dreaded, on the part of the town, that from the rage of the people involving the town in the general odium of abetting the exci&s;e law, it would be laid in a&s;hes. And I aver that it would have been the ca&s;e, had it not been for the prompt and deci&s;ive re&s;olutions of the town, to march out and meet them as brethren, and comply with all demands. This had the effect, and the battalions marched into town on the 3d, and during their delay there, and cantonment in the neighbourhood, with a trifling exception of a &s;light damage done to the proper|ty of Abraham Kirkpatrick, in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his tenant, which was afterwards compen&s;ated <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In this I was mi&s;taken; it had it been propo&s;ed to compen&s;ate, but ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> not been done.

<P>The town of Pitt&s;burgh will &s;end delegates to the meeting of the 14th in&s;tant&mdash;what the re&s;ult will be, I know not. I flat|ter my&s;elf, nothing more than to &s;end commi&s;&s;ioners to the Pre|&s;ident
<PB N="130" REF="028332_0327_0FD897C5F36F2128">
with an addre&s;s, propo&s;ing that he &s;hall delay any at|tempt to &s;uppre&s;s this in&s;urrection, as it will be &s;tiled, until the meeting of Congre&s;s. This will be the object, &s;imply and a|lone, with all that labour to avert a civil war. On the part of the government, I would earne&s;tly pray a delay until &s;uch ad|dre&s;s and commi&s;&s;ioners may come forward. This is my object in writing you this letter, which I de&s;ire you to communicate either by the Gazette, or otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>It will be &s;aid, this in&s;urrection can be ea&s;ily &s;uppre&s;&s;ed&mdash;it is but that of a part of four counties. Be a&s;&s;ured, it is that of the greater part&mdash;and I am induced to believe, the three Vir|ginia counties, on this &s;ide the mountain, will fall in. The fir&s;t mea&s;ure then will be, the organization of a new govern|ment, comprehending the three Virginia counties, and tho&s;e of Penn&s;ylvania, to the we&s;tward, to what extent I know not. This event, which I contemplate with great pain, will be the re&s;ult of the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;elf-defence. For this rea&s;on, I ear|ne&s;tly and anxiou&s;ly wi&s;h that delay on the part of government may give time to bring about, if practicable, good order and &s;ubordination. By the time the Congre&s;s meets, there may be a favourable i&s;&s;ue to the negociation, with regard to the naviga|tion of the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi, the we&s;tern po&s;ts, &amp;c. A &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of the exci&s;e law, during the Indian war, a mea&s;ure I propo&s;ed in a publication three years ago, in Philadelphia, may, perhaps, &s;uf|fice. Being then on an equal footing with other parts of the union, if they &s;ubmitted to the law, this country might al&s;o.</P>
<P>I anticipate all that can be &s;aid with regard to example, &amp;c. I may be mi&s;taken, but I am deci&s;ive in opinion that the United States cannot effect the operation of the law in this country. It is univer&s;ally odious in the neighbouring parts of all the neigh|bouring &s;tates, and the militia under the law, in the hands of the Pre&s;ident cannot be called out to reduce an oppo&s;ition. The midland counties, I am per&s;uaded, will not even &s;uffer the mi|litia of more di&s;tant parts of the union, to pa&s;s through them.</P>
<P>But the exci&s;e law is a branch of the funding &s;y&s;tem, dete&s;t|ed and abhorred by all the philo&s;ophic men, and the yeomanry of America, tho&s;e who hold certificates excepted. There is a growling, lurking di&s;content at this &s;y&s;tem, that is ready to bur&s;t out and di&s;cover it&s;elf every where. I candidly and de|cidedly tell you, the chariot of government has been driven Je|hu-like as to the finances; like that of Phaeton, it has de&s;cended from the middle path, and is likely to burn up the American earth.</P>
<P><PB N="131" REF="028332_0328_0FD8854E281A4FC8">Should an attempt be made to &s;uppre&s;s the&s;e people, I am a|fraid the que&s;tion will not be, whether you will march to Pitt&s;|burgh, but whether they will march to Philadelphia, accumu|lating in their cour&s;e, and &s;welling over the banks of the Su&s;|quehanna like a torrent, irre&s;i&s;tible, and devouring in its pro|gre&s;s. There can be no equality of conte&s;t, between the rage of a fore&s;t, and the abundance, indolence, and opulence of a city. If the Pre&s;ident has evinced a prudent and approved de|lay in the ca&s;e of the Briti&s;h &s;poilations, in the ca&s;e of the Indian tribes; much more humane and politic will it be to con&s;ult the internal peace of the government, by avoiding force until every means of accommodation are found unavailing. I deplore my per&s;onal &s;ituation; I deplore the &s;ituation of this country, &s;hould a civil war en&s;ue.</P>
<P>An application to the Briti&s;h is &s;poken of, which, may God avert. But what will not de&s;pair produce?</P>

<P>"July 4, 1794, went to a mu&s;ter at colonel Parker's; peo|ple chiefly collected, and in their ranks; went to a piece of ground; mu&s;tered; manoeuvered, and returned to Parker's; ranged them&s;elves in companies. A paper was produced for every man to put his mark that oppo&s;ed the exci&s;e law; one pa|per went through two or three companies; &s;aw, or heard of no man who refu&s;ed &s;igning it, but one; the people much di&s;|plea&s;ed with him; he was threatened; &s;peeches made again&s;t the exci&s;e law; &s;aid the power of Congre&s;s was &s;uch they did

not know where it would end; they had made a &s;upplement to the former law, that there &s;hould be but one office in each coun|ty; that they had lately erected an office in Wa&s;hington county, but found they could not &s;upport it; that in their opinion they &s;hould not &s;ubmit to the law at all; that it was better to take up arms again&s;t it; urged the people in &s;trong terms to hold out, and not &s;ubmit to it; a&s;ked a gentlemen, whom I thought a friend, what was be&s;t for me to do, as the people had thrown out threats again&s;t me; &s;aid, he had been my friend; but it was time for me to &s;ay &s;omething for my&s;elf; that the cri&s;is was come when they would have no &s;uch people, and I mu&s;t be one way or the other.</P>
<P>A few days before this meeting, major &mdash; mentioned to me, that it would not be long before I would hear of a party of 400 or 500 who would join to &s;uppre&s;s the exci&s;e office in the county, and that they would march to general Neville's. I communicated this, and what pa&s;&s;ed at the meeting, to colonel Neville.</P>
<P>Had apprehen&s;ions both for my per&s;on and property; re|&s;olves pa&s;&s;ed at a committee, again&s;t every one that entered &s;tills, and general threats held out again&s;t it.

<P>WHEN I &s;ay revi&s;ionary, I do not mean, that after hav|ing fini&s;hed this narrative, I have revi&s;ed, at mature lei&s;ure, what has been written: that was not in my power. I &s;ent it to the pre&s;s, at the di&s;tance of 300 miles, by the po&s;t, weekly, as I wrote it. It is revi&s;ionary only by recollection.</P>
<P>I recollect to have mentioned judge Addi&s;on, as coming for|ward, at an early period, with a &s;trong publication, in favour of the exci&s;e law. It was not &s;o much in vindication of the principles of the law, as conciliating the public mind to an ac|quie&s;cence with it. I have repre&s;ented him, as being under the nece&s;&s;ity "of taking in his &s;ails, and &s;lacking cour&s;e." By that I do not mean any dereliction of duty, but nece&s;&s;ary prudence in not continuing an evangeli&s;t of the law. For it mu&s;t be acknowledged, that he did not fail to reprehend, in his charges to the grand juries, the ma&s;ked attacks upon exci&s;e of|ficers, and to recommend a &s;trict cognizance of the offences. In fact, the like &s;entiments with tho&s;e in his late charge publi&s;hed, were delivered years ago in the cour&s;e of his circuits. I men|tion the&s;e things the more minutely; becau&s;e his reputation has been attacked by in&s;inuations, as not having acted with &s;uf|ficient firmne&s;s; or as winking at the outrages in their com|mencement; and having made u&s;e of a voucher from him, it concerns me to have his conduct under&s;tood.</P>
<P>I have given it, as my opinion, that the in&s;urrection was not projected by any one. It may &s;eem &s;trange with &s;ome, that this could be the ca&s;e. It &s;eems &s;trange to me that any one could &s;uppo&s;e it otherwi&s;e. Are there any traces of pre-con|cert? any evidence of con&s;piracy to &s;ubvert the government? has any foreign corre&s;pondence been di&s;covered? any ways and means devi&s;ed of &s;upplying with arms and ammunition? they mu&s;t have been weak men indeed, that could project a revolu|tion, and think of effecting it by committee meetings, and re|&s;olves alone&punc; I have always felt great indignation at the &s;ug|ge&s;tion, that it was projected by me; not only becau&s;e I was unwilling to have it thought that I was capable of devi&s;ing &s;o great an evil, but becau&s;e I di&s;dained the idea of having pro|jected
<PB N="141" REF="028332_0338_0FD897DCC995BC40">
a thing without, at the &s;ame time, projecting proper means of accompli&s;hing it. If it had been with a view of over|throwing the government, I would have had &s;ome corre&s;pon|dence or intercour&s;e of communication with the di&s;contented el&s;ewhere. If a &s;eparation of this country, from the union, had been intended, it would have been advi&s;able to have found|ed the Briti&s;h and Spaniards on the &s;ubject. It might have been well to have been at London, before John Jay was. What could we have offered to the Briti&s;h? the po&s;ts and a part of the we&s;tern lands; what to the Spaniards? a guarantee of Loui&s;iana from our&s;elves. My mind would have run in &s;ome train of this nature; I would not have depended on the efforts of a mob, without a &s;y&s;tem to give them efficacy and continu|ance.

<P>Did it not appear ab&s;urd to hear the Briti&s;h politicians, in the cour&s;e of la&s;t war, talk of our projecting independence, be|fore the commencement of the revolution? The de&s;truction of the tea, &amp;c. and, finally, the non-importation agreement, might have convinced them of the contrary. Common &s;en&s;e, with that project in view, would have led us to &s;upply our&s;elves, with all articles as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible, previous to a conte&s;t. It appears equally ab&s;urd to us in the we&s;tern country to hear people talk of any one projecting the in&s;urrection. It was be|gun by people that never had a thought beyond driving the exci&s;e officer out of his di&s;trict, and keeping the mar&s;hal from &s;erving or returning his proce&s;s. The &s;ub&s;equent acts were with a veiw to &s;hield the fir&s;t. Yet the&s;e &s;ub&s;equent acts would naturally have led to others to &s;hield them, and thus the ac|tors would have gone on to the utmo&s;t extremes, without thinking of the &s;econd &s;tep, before they took the fir&s;t. The rage which had at fir&s;t bur&s;t forth, had given way to de&s;pera|tion. This in&s;tinctively had catched hold of others not invol|ved, dragged them along to &s;hare their danger, and increa&s;e their force. The &s;ucce&s;s, &s;urpa&s;&s;ing expectation, gave way to ambition, and the idea of reform began to embrace an exten|&s;ive &s;cope. This is the natural hi&s;tory of the tran&s;action. But there is a propen&s;ity in the human mind to re&s;olve all phe|nomena in phy&s;ics, metaphy&s;ics, politics, &amp;c. into &s;ome great cau&s;e that produces them, in&s;tead of ten thou&s;and that have contributed. Ju&s;t as one looking at the mouth of a river, would &s;uppo&s;e i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to have originated from a large lake, in&s;tead of &s;mall &s;prings fed by extractions from the ocean.</P>
<P><PB N="142" REF="028332_0339_0FD897DDF4AA8F28">I was amu&s;ed with the fir&s;t account I had of the repre&s;en|tion of the Nevilles re&s;pecting me; that I was a man of ex|treme ingenuity, great &s;ubtility, infinite addre&s;s, and ver&s;abil|ity; the mo&s;t dangerous man in the we&s;tern country. Gallatin and Finley were nothing to me. Like an evil &s;pirit in the winds, I could move a tempe&s;t without being &s;een my&s;elf; this was all preparatory to the having me arre&s;ted on &s;u&s;picion, and hanged without proof. It will be a&s;ked; how is it po&s;&s;ible that this connection &s;hould appear to have had a &s;tronger prejudice again&s;t me, than even again&s;t Bradford or Mar&s;hall, or the in|&s;urgents concerned in burning the hou&s;e? I an&s;wer this by a&s;king a que&s;tion. Whom do you &s;uppo&s;e, did the emigrant nobility at Coblentz, hate mo&s;t, of all tho&s;e whom they left in France? doubtle&s;s the Marquis de la Fayette, becau&s;e he was attached to the people to a certain extent, and was unwilling to go with Mon&s;ieur and the count de Arto's all lengths; and this offended their pride more than if he had been again&s;t them altogether. Ju&s;t &s;o with the Nevilles family in my ca&s;e. They might &s;uppo&s;e me to di&s;approve of the outrages com|mitted, or at lea&s;t to have no concern in them; yet were en|raged, becau&s;e I was reluctant to expo&s;e my&s;elf with them to an equal odium in popular opinion; or becau&s;e I had advi&s;ed yielding mea&s;ures, at the fir&s;t, when they, in the pride of their pa&s;&s;ion, were for the mo&s;t violent. I deduce one princi|ple, that, let an in&s;urrection happen when it will, an implicit confidence ought not to be placed in the repre&s;entation of emi|grants. It will generally be again&s;t the be&s;t men, who were tho&s;e who had coun&s;elled moderate mea&s;ures, and wi&s;e, becau&s;e mo|derate, that they will bear the mo&s;t unfavourable te&s;timony.</P>
<P>But independent of this principle, there was a mi&s;conception of my &s;ituation and intentions; and antecedent to all this, they had re&s;olved certain acts of mine, in my profe&s;&s;ional capacity, into a &s;pirit of malignity, and were predi&s;po&s;ed to unfavoura|ble con&s;tructions of all I could do or &s;ay.</P>
<P>I have &s;tated &s;ome things from a certain Miller relative to language of general Neville, on the &s;ubject of Graham, the collector under the exci&s;e law. My object was to &s;hew, that general Neville u&s;ed to talk like other people again&s;t the ex|ci&s;e law; or if the relation of Miller is not true, it will prove that &s;peeches can be attributed to men that were never made.</P>
<P>I have introduced an incident of a certain Ga&s;ton, my cli|ent; it was to &s;hew how ea&s;ily an argument to the man, or
<PB N="143" REF="028332_0340_0FD897E001EFFCA8">
the people, the <HI>quo animo</HI> not being under&s;tood, may be made evidence again&s;t a per&s;on.</P>
<P>I have mentioned the &s;en&s;ibility with which I felt an expre&s;|&s;ion of the attorney general, commi&s;&s;ioner Bradford. It was becau&s;e I had expected no di&s;tru&s;t from him. I was &s;ome years with him at the &s;ame college, and &s;ome part of the time, of the &s;ame chamber; and had maintained a friend&s;hip ever &s;ince. I had &s;aid that I had not been involved in the in&s;urrection, but came forward to negociate for tho&s;e who were. I thought he ought to have given an implicit credit to my declaration. For my idea was, that all who knew me, mu&s;t know, that if involv|ed, I would have had the &s;pirit to have avowed it, and ju&s;tified it. My impre&s;&s;ions were removed in the manner I have &s;tated. The po&s;t of ye&s;terday has announced the death of that gentle|man, which I &s;incerely regret, and &s;ub&s;cribe to that eulogium which the public gives of his virtues and talents.</P>
<P>I have given &s;ome idea of the unfavourable impre&s;&s;ions of the people of Philadelphia, with regard to me, when in that city; there were in&s;tances of individuals, no doubt, who had been better informed, and who were not aver&s;e; but it was my choice to be at a di&s;tance from all, until my &s;ituation generally was under&s;tood.</P>
<P>It will be a&s;ked me, How comes it that my brother of the bar and the Neville connection &s;tand well, notwith&s;tanding the part taken by him in the fir&s;t committee? His procuring him|&s;elf to be elected in that committee, was with a view to an ap|proaching election, at which he was a candidate again&s;t Findley for the Congre&s;s. He was violent again&s;t the exci&s;e law, but meant nothing more than to gain a momentary popularity. The Nevilles knew this, and excu&s;ed him; more e&s;pecially as he pretended to them, that he had &s;oftened matters in the com|mittee from what they would otherwi&s;e have been. In addition to this, he has been the family lawyer, in ca&s;es in which I have found my&s;elf under the painful nece&s;&s;ity of pre&s;&s;ing &s;ome branch|es of the connection. There has al&s;o taken place a conjunction of intere&s;t in certain co-purcha&s;es at &s;heriff's &s;ales. The&s;e cau&s;|es may &s;ufficiently account for a good under&s;tanding between them; more e&s;pecially when it is under&s;tood, that having &s;ailed in his &s;troke at popularity, by attacking the exci&s;e law, he had thrown him&s;elf back into the bed of government, as ha&s;tily as po&s;&s;ible. Neverthele&s;s, as he had got his eye to Congre&s;s once more, I am inclined to believe, that had he been in the country at the beginning of the in&s;urrection, he would have made a &s;troke at popularity, and been with the in&s;urgents. Even at

the late point of the game at which he came forward, I have no judgment of mankind, if it was not a matter of he&s;itation with him, which part he &s;hould take. He was in balance un|til he &s;aw the game was up, by an acquie&s;cence of the princi|pal part, with the terms of the commi&s;&s;ioners.</P>
<P>It will be queried, How does it con&s;i&s;t with my repre&s;entation of the general odium of the exci&s;e law, and the nece&s;&s;ity of at lea&s;t concealing favourable &s;entiments with regard to an acqui|e&s;cence under it, that Neville, the &s;on of the in&s;pector, has been elected to the legi&s;lature from the county of Allegheny, at three &s;ucce&s;&s;ive elections, and probably before this book appears, will have been elected a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> a fourth? I an&s;wer, he is thought to be a man of judgment, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es conciliating manners; inde|pendent of this, he has been &s;everal years &s;urveyor of the coun|ty, and has had it in his power to &s;erve many per&s;ons. He has been al&s;o brigade in&s;pector, holding appeals in the ca&s;e of mili|tia duties. He has had other occa&s;ional offices, &s;uch as the em|ployment of patroles for the frontiers, &amp;c. His brother-in-law quarter-ma&s;ter, and commi&s;&s;ary at Pitt&s;burgh, and in that ca|pacity, having the employment of great numbers of people in me|chanical trades, in contracts of a various nature, for public pur|po&s;es, has influence. The office of in&s;pector it&s;elf, in the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of general Neville, though generally odious, yet by fa|vour, or hope, is &s;till able to attract intere&s;t. In addition to this, the young man had the addre&s;s at fir&s;t, to have it under|&s;tood, that he was again&s;t the exci&s;e law, and di&s;approved of his father's accepting the office; at lea&s;t there were per&s;ons who propagated this in his favour; and there were of the populace, weak enough to believe it. The rumour was, that he had en|gaged to have the law repealed. At the &s;ame time he was &s;up|ported by the Wilkins family, &s;trong al&s;o in influence of office, and there being no con&s;iderable per&s;on that had yet &s;prung up a|mong&s;t the people of this country, on whom they could fix, he was &s;uffered to be elected, and to continue. At the &s;uppre&s;|&s;ion of the in&s;urrection, and ever &s;ince, fear has done a great deal for him. The more ignorant people do not know, but it may be con&s;trued high trea&s;on to vote again&s;t him. In due time they will recover a &s;edate, and correct &s;en&s;e of rights and duties, and will not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ap republican principles, by &s;uffering &s;o great an evil, as &s;o many offices, with a legi&s;lative appointment, to meet in one man, however re&s;pectable.

The fact is, I have never heard any thing again&s;t him or his father, but that avidity of office, which &s;eems to po&s;&s;e&s;s them, as if there were no per&s;ons out of their family, capable of holding offices; or who ought to have the honour, or emoluments <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Major Craig at pre&s;ent is deputy quarter-ma&s;ter of the &s;tate; deputy quarter ma&s;ter-general, under the United States; deputy commi&s;&s;ary-gen|eral, under the United States; commi&s;&s;ary of the military &s;tores, and no|tary-public, &amp;c.</NOTE>.

But the principal ground of preference was, that Gallatin had been with John Cannon of the obnoxious committees; and Reddick not of any. I was &s;truck at the time with the bad policy of nominating ei|ther Gallatin or Findley; but did not chu&s;e to make any oppo|&s;ition, as it might be thought I had a wi&s;h to go my&s;elf. Find|ley was obnoxious with the government, and con&s;idered as one of tho&s;e who had laid the foundation of the oppo&s;ition to the exci&s;e law, and therefore by no means a proper per&s;on to &s;end forward on that occa&s;ion.

<P>Page 12. Vol. II.&mdash;I have given it as my opinion, that the a&s;&s;embly of the &s;tate had a right to in&s;truct the &s;enators from the &s;tate in the &s;enate of the United States. This will be que&s;|tioned. But it all turns upon what is to be under&s;tood by <HI>in|&s;tructing.</HI> I under&s;tand no more by it than <HI>informing</HI> them, or communicating wi&s;hes, and views. I have no idea that in&s;tructions ought to bind; as in the ca&s;e of an officer to his &s;ubordinate. The member from a county, is a member for the &s;tate when e|lected; and in&s;tructions from the whole &s;tate only, can be &s;up|po&s;ed to bind; and not even in that ca&s;e, am I clear that they ought to bind; becau&s;e the delegate is the con&s;tituted authority to think for the occa&s;ion. He is &s;ent upon deck; he is put at the helm; it is his to &s;teer; but others upon deck or in the hold have a right to talk; and expre&s;s their ideas with regard to the &s;teering.

&s;in,</HI> as "a the&s;is I &s;hould like to &s;ee di&s;cu&s;&s;ed." It may be queried whether it amounted to a mi&s;demeanor cognizable by law. I do not &s;ee that an indictment on this ground could be &s;upported. I might publi&s;h with impunity, that I would inter|change no office of civility with one that would refu&s;e a challenge; yet there is a law prohibiting the giving or accepting a challenge. But on the ground of ab&s;tract political virtue, there is greater ground of operation. It is an attempt to defeat a law by <HI>non u&s;er.</HI> Now, if an individual is warrantable in &s;uch a re&s;olution, all are; and if with regard to one law, with regard to all. It is the act of an individual determining to hold his breath, or refu&s;e food. It is &s;uicide as certainly, though not &s;o &s;peedily, as by the po&s;itive act of di&s;patching by a pi&s;tol ball. If one part of a community may re&s;olve to defeat one law, another part may re&s;olve to defeat another by the force of opinion, and the body politic may die. I know I &s;hall be encountered by a greater authority than that of the re&s;olves of the Pitt&s;burgh committee. It is that of John Dickin&s;on, James Wil&s;on, and others, the primores of Penn&s;ylvania, at the adoption of the &s;tate con&s;titu|tion in 1776. I do not know that it was re&s;olved formally by them in committee to accept no appointment under the con&s;ti|tution, and to frown upon tho&s;e who did; but certainly it was under&s;tood to be their determination, and their conduct.

<P>Page 21.

The revenue is the &s;pring of the govern|ment, and the collection of it ought to be con&s;idered as a &s;acred duty; and he ought to be a man of property who &s;hall be in|tru&s;ted with the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the public money. The only &s;en|timent which I can with confidence entertain on this &s;ubject, is, that though no contempt ought to be attached to the office of collector, yet certainly &s;uperior honour to that of a legi&s;lator. For any hone&s;t man that can keep accounts is qualified for a re|venue officer; but it requires exten&s;ive knowledge, and di&s;tin|gui&s;hed judgment, to fit for the making laws: and a man that has once had the honour from the people of being made their &s;overeign for a period, ought to be forever above a mercenary employment, unle&s;s the narrowne&s;s of his circum&s;tances ren|ders

<HEAD>Remarks.</HEAD>
<P>I REPRESENT Bradford and Mar&s;hall as brought for|ward, and urged by the people. I mean in the early &s;tage of the bu&s;ine&s;s. The affair of the mail, and of Braddock's field, was their own act; but it was done with a view to cover what had been done, by making <HI>the oppo&s;ition formidable to the govern|ment.</HI> I had the &s;ame idea al&s;o; but contemplated a different mode, which was <HI>mediating with the government.</HI></P>
<P>I have &s;een a gentleman from New-Orleans (Mr. Holling&s;|worth) who had conver&s;ed with Bradford, who averred to him, that this had been <HI>his ultimate object;</HI> and that James Mar&s;hall knew it to be &s;o. He was a&s;ked then by this gentleman, why it was that having obtained terms from the commi&s;&s;ioners, for <HI>the peo|ple and him&s;elf,</HI> he pronounced an inflammatory &s;peech at Brown&s;|ville again&s;t the accepting them. He acknowledged it was <HI>be|cau&s;e he &s;aw the fur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of the people again&s;t the accepting, and was afraid to have it t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ought that he was for &s;ubmitting.</HI> This proves what I have &s;aid; that he <HI>wanted fortitude, as well as good &s;en&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. Holling&s;worth al&s;o mentioned at this time the circum|&s;tance of Bradford, acknowledging that he had no <HI>confidential intimacy with me, by letter or otherwi&s;e, in the cour&s;e of the in|&s;urrection.</HI> I de&s;ired Mr. Holling&s;worth to give me a certificate of this, which he did by letter, and which I have in&s;erted. It was in the hurry of the court bu&s;ine&s;s at Pitt&s;burgh, and I had the opportunity of but a few &s;econds conver&s;ation with Mr. Holling&s;worth, in the few days that he detained at that place. James Ro&s;s and general Wilkins had more, and I am informed by them &s;ince, that Mr. Holling&s;worth mentioned to them, that Bradford acknowledged to him, <HI>that &s;hortly after my addre&s;s to him at Parkin&s;on's ferry meeting, in the ca&s;e of the exiles, Bri&s;on and others,</HI> he di&s;covered that I was <HI>managing him,</HI> and that though I &s;ugge&s;ted difficulties, and abu&s;ed the men, my real &s;cope was to carry a re&s;olution for their recal. Mr. Holling&s;|worth had de&s;cended the river before I had the information, or I would have reque&s;ted him &s;pecially to have certified this, in the letter which he had promi&s;ed to leave for me. For it would

&s;upport my &s;tatement of my management of Bradford, and which otherwi&s;e &s;ome might think was <HI>more plau&s;ible than true.</HI> But it is well known in the we&s;tern country, that before this time, I had managed him in the &s;ame manner, and prevailed with him to do what was right, of which I could give many in|&s;tances. Sometimes I have failed, even in a point of <HI>honour and intere&s;t for him&s;elf,</HI> of which I could give one very extraor|dinary example.&mdash;It <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n the knowledge of judge Addi&s;on.</P>
<P>The outrages on the revenue officers, in the in&s;urrection, always &s;truck me <HI>in bulk,</HI> as, by the deci&s;ions of the judges of the Engli&s;h courts, amounting to the crime of <HI>high trea&s;on.</HI> In the fir&s;t trials of the pri&s;oners at Philadelphia, I under&s;tood this to be admitted <HI>by the council,</HI> and <HI>&s;o directed by the court.</HI> In the la&s;t trials at York, there was no pleading&punc; and no direction by the court. The evidence was &s;ubmitted to the jury. But after the clo&s;e of the te&s;timony in the la&s;t ca&s;e, William Lewis, of coun|&s;el for the pri&s;oners, expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to me, <HI>that on a view of all the facts,</HI> now fully come out in evidence, he had no he&s;ita|tion in a&s;&s;erting, that <HI>no trea&s;on had been committed in the coun|try;</HI> and that had an argument with the jury taken place, he had been prepared to &s;hew this.</P>
<P>I have &s;een him &s;ince in Philadelphia, and he has expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf with confidence to the &s;ame effect, and that on the trials of the indictment for mi&s;demeanors, which are laid, as in aid of this trea&s;on, he will be prepared to contend, <HI>that no trea&s;on had been committed,</HI> in aid of which any thing could have been done or &s;aid. If it &s;hould &s;o appear, let it be con&s;idered that it has been no object of my publication to di&s;cu&s;s this que&s;tion. Nor could I have done it without having that te&s;timony with the mo&s;t perfect exactne&s;s, which <HI>has been obtained in court.</HI> But I pre&s;ume i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> a report of the&s;e trials, this que&s;tion will be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed with advantage, from the argument of that very able lawyer, and di&s;tingui&s;hed philanthopi&s;t, who&s;e name I have tak|en the liberty of introducing in this ca&s;e. I have not mention|ed his opinion of the homicide committed by the in&s;pector at the fir&s;t attack upon his hou&s;e, whether <HI>ju&s;tifiable,</HI> or in &s;trictne&s;s of law, criminal; but with regard to this, he expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf with the &s;ame confidence. This may come into view <HI>indirectly,</HI> on the que&s;tion of trea&s;on. All I chu&s;e to &s;ay in general is, that if the in&s;pector of the revenue had, in the fir&s;t advance of the rioters to his hou&s;e, acted <HI>l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;s <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;tily,</HI> no farther outrage would have taken place; and I aver, that on the &s;econd <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">

had Kirkpatrick yielded with good policy, for the moment, to what the mob reque&s;ted, <HI>there would have been no in ur|rection;</HI> and I know that any man then engaged in the out|rages, would have yielded, when the fury had &s;ub&s;ided, to the civil authority of the country; and I am confident, that this would have been competent to pre&s;erve the peace. After the country had became generally involved in de&s;perate acts, the civil authority would not have been competent. I &s;aw all this fully, when I gave my advice to Neville the younger, to parry the tempe&s;t, by advi&s;ing his father <HI>to &s;urrender the paper,</HI> which the mob had it in view to demand. I do not arrogate to my&s;elf a &s;uperior judgment to the&s;e men; but my mind was cool, theirs was inflamed, and <HI>pride oppo&s;ed the acting judiciou&s;ly.</HI></P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the in&s;tant, deci&s;ive, and humane interpo|&s;ition of general Morgan in favour of my life, when his dragoons were within <HI>a few &s;econds</HI> of di&s;patching me, yet he had no ob|jection to the having me conducted out of this trouble&s;ome world in a <HI>legal way.</HI> Some time in the winter &s;ucceeding the in&s;ur|rection, coming into Pitt&s;burgh he communicated it as a pro|found &s;ecret, that he was in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of what would &s;ettle the bu&s;ine&s;s with me, a <HI>trea&s;onable corre&s;pondence with Daniel Ha|milton.</HI> It is not po&s;&s;ible, &s;aid the per&s;on; I have the papers, &s;aid the general, in my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The fact was, that a number of the refugees, or tho&s;e who had ab&s;conded, at the coming of the army, had returned, and &s;urrendered them&s;elves to him. His reception of them was not barely civil, but ho&s;pitable; and it appeared to be a leading ob|ject, to di&s;cover &s;omething from them again&s;t me. Daniel Hamilton who was one of the&s;e, and frequently at his table, perceiving this wi&s;h of the general, actually palmed upon him &s;ome papers, as my hand writing; but which on being laid be|fore the board at Pitt&s;burgh, I pre&s;ume were found not to be genuine; and recollecting the <HI>foux pas,</HI> in the ca&s;e of a letter addre&s;&s;ed to William Bradford, it was thought proper to bury the circum&s;tance. Daniel Hamilton, however, alarmed at the detection thought proper to ab&s;cond a &s;econd time, and not re|turn.</P>
<P>But let the motive have been what it might, I perfectly ap|preciate the conduct of the general, in the ca&s;e of the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ina|tion meditated upon me; and I wi&s;h it to have all the prai&s;e that humanity de&s;erves.</P>

<HEAD>Anecdotes.</HEAD>
<P>At the trials of the indictments for the mi&s;demeanor of at|tacking the commi&s;&s;ioners at Green&s;burgh, it came out in evi|dence, that the rioters had been at fir&s;t at a lo&s;s for a leader; no one wi&s;hing to take upon him &s;o o&s;ten&s;ible, and, of con&s;e|quence, &s;o re&s;pon&s;ible a part; at length, a certain Spangler came forward and accepted it. "I will undertake it," &s;aid he, "I have nothing to lo&s;e."</P>
<P>A man in the we&s;tern country, lately applied to me for ad|vice in the ca&s;e of a &s;urveyor, who wi&s;hed to run a line within his &s;urvey on an adver&s;e warrant. I thought he might hinder him as a tre&s;pa&s;&s;er. "Ah!" &s;aid he, "but will not that <HI>bring the militia upon us?</HI>" I relate this to &s;hew the pro&s;trate &s;tate of the public mind. Ignorance is arrogant on fal&s;e appearances, and abject when reduced.</P>
<P>Another in&s;tance of this nature I had la&s;t winter, when I had given an opinion with regard to the eligibility of Neville the younger for the &s;tate legi&s;lature, and which was, that he was ineligible, holding the office of &s;urveyor, &amp;c. which, by the con|&s;titution, di&s;qualified him. This opinion was publi&s;hed. A friend of mine, a mechanic, came to me, "Oh!" &s;aid he, "you will be ruined now. Can't they make that out trea&s;on?" No, no, &s;aid I; I know what is trea&s;on, and what is not. "It is well for you," &s;aid he, "that you do; for our part that do not, we are afraid to &s;ay any thing." This is a proof that licentiou&s;ne&s;s leads to the lo&s;s of liberty.</P>

<P>A Part of the preceding publication was tran&s;mitted to the Printer in my own hand-writing, which not being ea&s;ily legible, errors have taken place; &s;ome part of it was tran&s;mitted in the hand of a copyi&s;t, who, in copying, had made mi&s;takes, over|looked by me; &s;o that it did not come correct to the pre&s;s; &s;ome errors may be &s;uppo&s;ed to have taken place there: Hence it is, that the publication will be found with a number of er|rors, &s;ome affecting the grammar, others the &s;en&s;e.
