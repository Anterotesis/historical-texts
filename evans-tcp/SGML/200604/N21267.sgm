<HEAD>STATE OF SOUTH-CAROLINA. IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, December 6th, 1793. The Committee to whom was referred the bu&s;ine&s;s of examining into, and a&s;certaining the truth of a report that an armed force is now levying within this &s;tate, by per&s;ons under a foreign authority, without the permi&s;&s;ion, and contrary to the expre&s;s prohibition of the government of the United States, and of this &s;tate, REPORT,</HEAD>
<P>THAT they have made diligent enquiry re&s;pecting the truth of this re|port, and have collected &s;uch evidence relating thereto as was immediately within their reach&mdash;that your committee are perfectly &s;atisfied, from the infor|mation, on the oaths of divers credible per&s;ons, which they have received, that William Tate, Jacob R. Brown, William Urby, Robert Tate, Richard Speke, citizens of this &s;tate, and other per&s;ons unknown to your committee, al&s;o citi|zens of this &s;tate, have received and accepted military commi&s;&s;ions from M. Genet, mini&s;ter plenipotentiary from the republic of France to the United States of America, authori&s;ing them, and in&s;tructions requiring them, to rai&s;e, or|ganize, train, and conduct troops, within the United States of America&mdash;That the avowed purpo&s;e for which the&s;e troops are now rai&s;ing, is, to rendezvous in the &s;tate of Georgia, and from thence to proceed into the Spani&s;h dominions, with a view to conque&s;t or plunder, as their &s;trength might enable, or opportu|nity might tempt them&mdash;That in the event of a French fleet approaching the coa&s;ts of the &s;outhern &s;tates, a junction and co operation with it is contemplated by the per&s;ons abovementioned; but that though this was the avowed object of the&s;e troops and their leaders, among them&s;elves; from the injunction to conceal the whole &s;y&s;tem from per&s;ons not initiated, and the &s;ubordination e&s;tabli&s;hed to Mr. Genet, the author of the plan, and the &s;ource of authority to the officers. It is probable that the corps, when rai&s;ed, mu&s;t yield to any change of de&s;tina|tion which the judgment or inclination of Mr. Genet may point out to them&mdash; That &s;everal of the per&s;ons above named, received, together with their com|mi&s;&s;ions, in&s;tructions by which they were to regulate their enrollments of men, stating the pay, rations, cloathing, plunder, and divi&s;ion of conquered land, to be allotted to the officers and men who &s;hould enter into this &s;ervice, and mark|ing the proportions of the acqui&s;itions to be re&s;erved to the republic of France&mdash; That the per&s;ons above named, in pur&s;uance of the powers ve&s;ted in them by the &s;aid commi&s;&s;ions, and in obedience to the in&s;tructions of M. Genet and his agents, particularly M. Mangourit, who &s;igned &s;ome of the papers, have proceeded by them&s;elves, and by their agents, without any authority from the United States, or from this &s;tate, to enroll numbers of the citizens of this &s;tate, whom they de|luded with the hopes of plunder and the acqui&s;ition of riches, in the &s;ervice of the republic of France, to be &s;ubject to the orders of Mr. Genet, the Mini&s;ter Plenipotentiary of France.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="027920_0004_0FD65B2F63424E60">That Stephen Drayton and John Hamilton, al&s;o citizens of this &s;tate, have made application to the good citizens thereof to engage in this &s;cheme of rai&s;ing men in this &s;tate for the &s;ervice of France, to act under the orders of M. Genet, and to commit acts of ho&s;tility again&s;t nations at peace with the United States of America; and have avowed that they acted by the authority of M. Genet, the Mini&s;ter Plenipotentiary of the Republic of France; that upon the whole of the information which your committee have been able to obtain, this is a daring and dangerous attempt by a foreign mini&s;ter to intermeddle in the affairs of the United States, to u&s;urp the powers of government, and to levy troops in the bo&s;om of the union, without the authority, and contrary to the expre&s;s &s;en&s;e of the government of the United States, and in violation of the laws of nations&mdash;</P>
<P>That the direct tendency of the&s;e mea&s;ures of the foreign mini&s;ter is to di&s;turb the internal tranquility of the United States, and to involve them in ho&s;tilities with nations with whom they are now at peace, which &s;ound policy requires &s;hould be pre&s;erved.&mdash;That in the opinion of your committee this attempt is the more dangerous and alarming as many citizens of the United States have been thereby &s;educed from their duty by in&s;idious arts practiced on their kindred af|fection to the French republic; and have been drawn into a &s;cheme, in the exe|cution of which they have u&s;urped the functions of government, and exerci&s;ed the power of the &s;word, which the wi&s;dom of the con&s;titution hath ve&s;ted exclu|&s;ively in the Congre&s;s and Pre&s;ident of the United States.&mdash;That this committee therefore recommend that the governor of this &s;tate be reque&s;ted to i&s;&s;ue his pro|clamation, forbidding all per&s;ons from enrolling any of the citizens of this &s;tate, and prohibiting the citizens from enli&s;ting under any officers, or for any pur|po&s;es not previou&s;ly &s;anctioned by the government of the United States, or of this &s;tate; and al&s;o forbidding all unlawful a&s;&s;emblages of troops, unauthori&s;ed by government; and that the governor be reque&s;ted to exert the whole public force to the utmo&s;t extent, if nece&s;&s;ary, to in&s;ure obedience to his proclamation.</P>
<P>That in the opinion of this committee, the &s;aid William Tate, Jacob R. Brown, Robert Tate, Stephen Drayton, John Hamilton, and Richard Speke, have been guilty of high crimes and mi&s;deme&s;nours; and they recommend that the attorney-general and &s;olicitors be directed, forthwith to in&s;titute, or cau&s;e to be in&s;tituted and conducted, pro&s;ecutions in the proper courts of law, again&s;t the &s;aid William Tate, Jacob R.

<P>That copies of the evidence collected by this committee, together with the proceedings of this Hou&s;e thereon, be forwarded immediately to the Pre&s;ident of the United States, and to the executives of the &s;tates of North-Carolina and Georgia, for their information.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I LEARN by the reports of the con&s;ul of the Republic, at Charle&s;ton, and by the public papers, that the legi&s;lature of South-Carolina, had cau&s;ed to be arre&s;ted, different per&s;ons, accu&s;ed of having received from me commi&s;&s;ions for
<PB N="11" REF="027920_0009_0FD65B3C32A3F570">
the purpo&s;e of levying an armed force in that &s;tate, for the &s;ervice of the Repub|lic. Conceiving that &s;uch conduct, if it were true, would offend the &s;overeign|ty of the American people, I ha&s;ten to affirm to you, &s;ir, that I have not autho|rized in any manner, the recruiting, the formation, or the collecting of an arm|ed force, or of any corps <HI>in the territory of the United States</HI>; but at the &s;ame time, I am too frank to di&s;gui&s;e from you, that, authorized by the French nation, to deliver commi&s;&s;ions to tho&s;e of your fellow-citizens, who &s;hould feel them|&s;elves animated with a de&s;ire of &s;erving the be&s;t of cau&s;es, I have granted them to &s;everal brave republicans of South-Carolina, who&s;e intention appeared to me to be to expatriate them&s;elves, and to go among the independent Indian tribes, an|cient friends and allies of France, in order to retaliate, if they could, in concert with us, on the Spaniards and Engli&s;h, the injury which the government of the&s;e two nations had the ba&s;ene&s;s, for &s;ome time to commit on your fellow-citizens, under the name of the&s;e &s;avages, in like manner, as is lately done under that of the Algerines.</P>
<P>I notify you, &s;ir, that I &s;hall publi&s;h this declaration, in order to calm inqui|etudes, and to di&s;&s;ipate the doubts to which the denunciation made in the legi&s;|ture of Carolina, might give ri&s;e.</P>
