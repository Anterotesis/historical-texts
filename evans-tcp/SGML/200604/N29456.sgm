<DATE>March, <HI>14. 1682.</HI></DATE></HEAD>
<P>THis Court con&s;idering the Solemn Warnings of Pro|vidence; both by Signs in the Heavens, and the various In&s;tances and Effects of Divine Di&s;plea|&s;ure, which we have felt formerly and of late, by Sword, Fire, Bla&s;tings, Lo&s;&s;es at Sea, Sickne&s;&s;es and Deaths of many Eminent and &V;&s;eful Per&s;ons among&s;t us; and tho&s;e Difficult Circum&s;tances we have been, and are yet labou|ring under, with re&s;pect to our Publick Affairs: As al&s;o the Troubles of the People of God, and Low and conflicting Condition of the Prote&s;tant Intere&s;t in <HI>Chri&s;tendom;</HI> And knowing that our Sins again&s;t, and Provocations of the Lord (which yet vi&s;ibly increa&s;e among&s;t us) are the procuring Cau&s;es thereof, and for which, without Reformation, we may yet ju&s;tly expect greater and more &V;niver&s;al Calamityes; And that the onely Means for the a|verting Impending Judgement, and lengthening out of our Tran|quillity, are Sincere Humiliation and Repentance,</P>
<P><HI>Do therefore Appoint the Tenth of</HI> May <HI>next for a Day of Solemn</HI> H&V;MILIATION <HI>throughout this Colony, therein humbly to implore the Mercy and Favour of God for our &s;elves here in re&s;pect of our Sacred, Civil, and Temporal Concerns; and more e&s;pecially tho&s;e in the Hands of our A|gents abroad; as al&s;o for tho&s;e Kingdoms, upon who&s;e VVel|fare our own doth &s;o nearly depend; and for the Prote&s;tant Churches and Intere&s;t el&s;ewhere. And all Mini&s;ters are de|&s;ired to give timely Notice to their People in their re&s;pective Churches and Towns, that they may be the better Prepared to attend upon the VVork of the Day, according to the Nature thereof, and the Solemn Calls of God thereunto. And all People are Forbidden &s;ervile Labour upon that Day.</HI></P>
