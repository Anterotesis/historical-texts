<HEAD>A DISSERTATION, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THE mind and body although widely different in them&s;elves, yet they are &s;o formed, and wonderfully uni|ted in us, that the one may be affected by the other in reci|procal &s;ympathy.</P>
<P>So intimate is this exi&s;ting connection, that every &s;en&s;a|tion of the mind, in a manner affects the body, the one, therefore, will be affected by the di&s;ea&s;es of the other. Every per&s;on mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible of the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">ections of the will, nor was the pride of the Stoics free from this, although they denied the&s;e affections to interrupt their divine wi&s;dom. Philo&s;ophers, therefore, feigned to know many things con|cerning the &s;eat of the will in the body. Ari&s;totle and the Peripatetics, placed it in the heart, and the ancients in the brain. Plato divided and di&s;tingui&s;hed all the pa&s;&s;ions into two, the covetous and ira&s;cible, the former he placed in the heart, the latter in the liver. There are &s;ome again who divide the various pa&s;&s;ions farther, and give to each affection of the mind &s;eparate &s;eats. And finally, Helmontius, and Des Cartes, place all the pa&s;&s;ions and faculties collectively; the for|mer in the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> upper orifice of the &s;tomach, the latter in
<PB REF="027638_0005_1026EB2129C1E160">
the Pineal gland. That the brain is the &s;eat of the mind, is a point, I believe, admitted <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> all <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">, but whether occupying that particular part, the Pineal gland, will not be decided here&punc; either pro or con; but that the mind, will or pa&s;&s;ions, operate upon the corporeal part of our &s;y&s;tem, through the medium of the Nerves, whether con&s;idered as taking their origin from the Encephalon, or as mere appen|dages thereto. All this, I &s;ay, appears probable from the effects of ligatures, made upon the nerves, and of the de|&s;truction of their continuity. It appears that in either, in an entire &s;tate, motions may be communicated from the brain to other parts of the &s;y&s;tem, and from the latter to the former; from injuries done the Brain, by either external or internal violence, the laws of &s;en&s;ation are impaired, and &s;ometimes de&s;troyed; and from the &s;ame experiments it would appear, that the Brain is the organ of &s;en&s;ation and volition, and of the &s;everal intellectual operations interven|ing between the&s;e; all which is confirmed by the effects of the organic affection of the Brain upon the intellectual facul|ties.</P>
<P>The Brain is thus the &s;en&s;orium or corporeal organ more immediately the &s;eat of, or connected with the mind, and &s;o far as corporeal organ is employed, all the thoughts ari&s;ing in con&s;equence of impre&s;&s;ion are the operations of the Brain and are modified by its various conditions.</P>
<P>Without entering into a di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the laws of &s;en&s;ati|on, either of impre&s;&s;ion or of con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s it is adequate to our purpo&s;e, to premi&s;e, that the mind &s;eems to be excited by the force of impre&s;&s;ion, from the plea&s;ure or pain ari&s;ing from it, by the degree of emotion or pa&s;&s;ion produced by the&s;e; and by the emotion being more or le&s;s related to the per&s;on feeling; and it may not be ami&s;s to add here, that the mind is capable of receiving but one impre&s;&s;ion at a time.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="027638_0006_1026EB2427411A50">With this, it remains for us to con&s;ider how far the pa&s;|&s;ions, as appendages of the mind are connected with the body and how far they are conducive to health or di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>The pa&s;&s;ions are nece&s;&s;ary and natural parts of our con|&s;titution, and by the order of nature they never were intend|ed as a &s;ource of di&s;ea&s;e either to body or mind; on the contrary when cau&s;ed to roll within their de&s;tined orbits, they prove reciprocally &s;erviceable to each other.</P>
<P>As to the body, they pre&s;erve the health of that, not only by exciting us to exerci&s;e; but likewi&s;e as an agency and ne|ce&s;&s;ary &s;timulus to the &s;upport of life, by immediately and &s;eparately affecting the circulation of the blood, for in pro|portion as the&s;e internal &s;en&s;es are ab&s;ent, the motion of the circulating ma&s;s is dimini&s;hed and the function of &s;ecretion impeded. Neither is this &s;entient principle of it&s;elf &s;uffi|cient, to pre&s;erve a due compo&s;ition and proper a&s;&s;imilation of the fluids, for the purpo&s;es of &s;ecretion and nutrition. For the pla&s;tick power of the fluids is &s;o great that &s;hould it happen that the nece&s;&s;ary &s;timulus to motion be with-held they may coagulate into a vi&s;cid ma&s;s. This is notified in a deep and protracted &s;leep; this &s;ituation in which the mind re&s;ts, renders the circulation flow and the blood it&s;elf di&s;co|vers a di&s;po&s;ition to &s;taguate. Hence if the &s;leep be &s;till further protracted, the fluids of the body will acquire a te|nacity that will be difficult to de&s;troy, and thereby the pur|po&s;e for which they were intended by nature will be defeat|ed. Neither ought the&s;e injuries to be a&s;cribed alone to the body's being in a &s;tate of re&s;t, but to an in&s;en&s;ibility or inactivity of the pa&s;&s;ions. The &s;ame &s;pace of time is pa&s;&s;ed by per&s;ons in a &s;tate of watchfulne&s;s, the pa&s;&s;ions then in a &s;tate of imperfect action, without any exerci&s;e of the body, when the fluids are neither rendered vi&s;cid nor the circula|tion retarded.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="027638_0007_1026DC0DA66B6B30">It is equally certain that &s;ome of the pa&s;&s;ions dimini&s;h the circulation of the blood, and produce a temporary &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of the &s;ecretions. If the&s;e are not truly immoderate and of long continuance they may be quickly removed, by a re&s;u&s;|citation of the more alert pa&s;&s;ions of the mind.</P>
<P>And here it is to be remarked that the&s;e two kinds of pa&s;|&s;ions, which we will call the <HI>impelling</HI> or <HI>repelling</HI> or in other words, tho&s;e that increa&s;e and tho&s;e that dimini&s;h the power of the vital and natural functions, which are very wi&s;ely and curiou&s;ly to be oppo&s;ed to each other, by which means, the one can be moderated, and corrected by the other. For if the mind is acted upon always by the more vivid and more active &s;en&s;es; the &s;pirits will be exhau&s;ted, and the ex|citability will be worn down &s;o far as to be but little influen|ced by the mo&s;t powerful &s;timuli of any kind. But the <HI>repelling</HI> or debilitating check this unnatural and di&s;ea&s;ed &s;tate of excitement, &s;trike an equilibrium, and reduce the &s;y&s;tem to the &s;tandard of health.</P>
<P>Such appear to be the re&s;ulting convenience of the pa&s;&s;ions, when curbed, and kept within due bounds. But as all things are put in a wor&s;e &s;ituation when changed from a law of nature; &s;o, the pa&s;&s;ions when they exceed either way their certain order and limits, they become di&s;&s;olute and ought to be avoided; not becau&s;e they di&s;turb the tranquility of the mind alone, but as they injure the temperament of the body. They, with a rapid and tumultuous impetus preci|pitate the motion of the blood and &s;pirits, or dimini&s;h their energy &s;o far as entirely to &s;ubdue them. Again, they violently contract or immoderately relax the &s;olids.</P>
<P>The&s;e few things being premi&s;ed, we next proceed to di&s;|tingui&s;h each pa&s;&s;ion&punc; but previou&s;ly it will not be improper to ob&s;erve, that it is not my intention in the following pages
<PB N="13" REF="027638_0008_1026EB2711FF8F28">
to de&s;cribe the more trifling emotions of the mind, or to run into metaphi&s;ical &s;ubtilties, but to particularize the &s;ymptoms of the more important, at the &s;ame time &s;hall <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> their phenomena and the di&s;ea&s;es of which they are produc|tive.</P>
<P>All the motions of the mind although various in the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">|ture and effects, &s;eem to ari&s;e from impre&s;&s;ions made upon our organs of &s;en&s;e, which may prove of a plea&s;ant or un|plea&s;ant nature, and accordingly excite emotions agreea|ble to the object pre&s;ented. Of the fir&s;t de&s;cription, are joy, de&s;ire and hope; and of the la&s;t are grief, hatred and fear; the&s;e being the primitive, and upon which the others mu&s;t depend, and of which they are compounded. And the&s;e are faculties of the mind that con&s;titute the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> of life; but, when perverted or erring in extremes, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> de&s;tructive to its exi&s;tence. Thus the extravagance of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> may be exalted into enthu&s;ia&s;m bordering upon madne&s;s, and exce&s;&s;ive fear may &s;ink into de&s;pair.</P>
<P>When joy &s;eizes the brea&s;t, the heart &s;uddenly leaps, the eyes &s;hine with &s;plendour, the cheeks partake of a beautiful redne&s;s and an ornamenting light beams on the countenance; The body is agreeably relaxed, and a proportion of blood, exciting the mo&s;t plea&s;ing &s;en&s;ations, is thrilled to the mo&s;t remote part of the &s;y&s;tem. But, although, the impetus of the blood be increa&s;ed, it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, that this af|fection has not that influence upon the arterial &s;y&s;tem that di&s;po&s;es it to febrile action, but &s;uch a warmth is induced only, as proves grateful. A tone of the &s;olids con&s;i&s;tent with health, mo&s;t generally attends at the &s;ame time the circulation becomes equable, and in a &s;tate proportionate to the &s;tate of the &s;olids. It frequently produces a flow of tears, which generally &s;erves to relieve nature, and are mo&s;tly accompanied with high mental gratification. Super|fluous joy being moderated by the general mode of evacu|ation

renders the body more agile and lively, and very much a&s;&s;i&s;ts the whole a&s;&s;imilating faculty. But when im|moderate, produces effects equally as di&s;tre&s;&s;ing and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> as a moderate proportion proves beneficial. It quickly like other powerful &s;timuli wears down the excitability, in|direct debility is induced and frequently death. Hence the nece&s;&s;ity of imparting good news gradually and accommo|dating &s;timulus to excitability. The celebrated Boerhaave affords us an in&s;tance of the effects of immoderate joy in a girl, and hi&s;tory gives us many ca&s;es of the &s;ame &s;ort. The &s;tory of the Roman mother is well known, who was bewailing the death of her &s;on, he &s;uddenly and unexpec|tedly appeared, the mother dropped down dead the in&s;tant he entered the apartment. Here the excitability was accu|mulated, whil&s;t the woman was labouring under the debili|tating pa&s;&s;ion of grief, indirect debility was induced, and in|&s;tant death followed. Our Profe&s;&s;or of the in&s;titutes makes mention of a ca&s;e, the man was a door-keeper to Congre&s;s, he expired &s;uddenly upon the receipt of news, that would have been a balm to his &s;oul, viz. the capture of Lord Corn|wallis. Therefore the greate&s;t deference ought to be paid to the ob&s;ervation of Seneca; res &s;evera e&s;t verum gaudi|<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="4 letters">.</P>
<P>De&s;ire being a pa&s;&s;ion compounded of hope and fear, its effects mu&s;t at times he very much varied. When united with hope, it quickens the circulation of the blood and occa|&s;ions a great flow of &s;pirits; but when with fear, it dimi|ni&s;hes the la&s;t de&s;cribed power; at the &s;ame time the moving fibre is reduced to a &s;tate of atony, and febrile di&s;ea&s;es not un|frequently en&s;ue. It al&s;o varies agreeable to the nature of the thing it craves. To de&s;cribe all the &s;pecies of this pa&s;&s;ion would be endle&s;s; therefore I will make choice of the mo&s;t

principal one, namely, the pa&s;&s;ion of love, or a de&s;ire of &s;ome grateful form.</P>
<P>When accidentally the form of a Venus has been pre|&s;ented to our view, love &s;eems to ari&s;e within us, gradually, all warmth is cau&s;ed to vani&s;h from the mind, the flow and tumult of the pa&s;&s;ions, &s;ub&s;ide, and the affected langui&s;h into all plea&s;antne&s;s and &s;oftne&s;s; and harmony, with her &s;ilver train, ornaments all his walks. Solitude, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> and evening walks are &s;ought for, objects of pity are cheri&s;hed, and all the effu&s;ions of &s;entiment are tender, &s;edate and &s;ym|pathetic, and frightful dreams infe&s;t the tedious night. Nor is there wanting a con&s;entaneous emotion of the body, a gentle &s;en&s;ation creeps through all the nervous &s;y&s;tem, the circulation becomes equable, and the &s;olids are reduced to an agreeable degree of relaxation. Such are the effects of Love in its primitive and incipient &s;tages, before it has made impre&s;&s;ions of a permanent and fixed nature. But when it becomes deeper &s;ented, it di&s;turbs the &s;erenity of the mind, and the general economy of the body&mdash;the coun|tenance then becomes hung over with languor, the eyes indicate &s;ome remarkable de&s;ire; the brea&s;t ri&s;es and falls like the di&s;turbed waters of the ocean, with deep and lan|gui&s;hing &s;ighs. The body becomes effeminated, and it un|locks every manly power of the &s;oul. The afflicted per&s;on is particularly agitated when in pre&s;ence of the beloved object. The heart leaps, and its Sy&s;tole and Dya&s;tole is repeated with increa&s;ed rapidity; the pul&s;e performs an inordinate action; the countenance at fir&s;t is &s;uffu&s;ed with redne&s;s and then &s;uddenly becomes pale.

through the whole circulatory &s;y&s;tem, has been the con&s;e|quence. Sometimes the breathing is laborious, the eyes are veiled with a cloud of mi&s;t, and the body is covered with a cold &s;weat. No pa&s;&s;ion &s;o imperceptibly under|mines the con&s;titution as the one now under con&s;ideration; debility, the predi&s;po&s;ing cau&s;e and mother of almo&s;t every di&s;ea&s;e, to which the human &s;pecies is liable, inevitably fol|lows: that plea&s;ant langour, which at fir&s;t was &s;o welcome to the body, at length proves to be its de&s;troyer. From the beginning the induced debility and effeminacy, the va|rious perturbations, which immediately follow, cannot be &s;u&s;tained without the greate&s;t agitation of both body and mind. But the irregular and de&s;ultory flow of the &s;pirits, the inequable flow of the blood, and the di&s;ordered &s;ecre|tions which invariably take place, &s;o far derange and ex|hau&s;t the whole &s;y&s;tem, that frequently this &s;tate ends in an incurable Tabes: Thus, the emperor Antiochus, &s;ecret|ly pined away, the cau&s;e of his di&s;ea&s;e being kept a &s;ecret from his Phy&s;icians. When this pa&s;&s;ion exceeds the bounds a&s;cribed to it by nature, and the object of his wi&s;hes can|not be obtained, it &s;ometimes induces melancholia, and &s;ometimes mania; varying agreeable to the temperament of the body, and al&s;o according to the degree of excite|ment, when this di&s;appointment is made.</P>
<P>Hope exhilerates the mind to a grateful anticipation; from whence appears in the body the more placid effects of a lenient joy. It is this &s;weet and ine&s;timable comfort that principally leads us on to re&s;pected old age, and it is this averts the &s;adne&s;s and horrible de&s;pair, that are too often cheri&s;hed, viz. the evils and misfortunes that await man|kind through life. Without this faculty, the functions of the animal economy, mu&s;t &s;oon be eclip&s;ed, neither has man any re&s;ource, from whence the vital, and natural powers, as far as a mental agent is nece&s;&s;ary, can be &s;o well &s;upport.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="027638_0012_1026EB3171257390" MS="y">That unwelcome gue&s;t, grief, makes its appearance, with tears, weeping and &s;obbing.

Be&s;ides all this, &s;ome one of the pa&s;&s;ions mu&s;t prevail, and govern the mind; and every being has his peculiar attachment and inclination to adhere to &s;ome of the&s;e affections.

Here, the mind, in the ordinary pur&s;uits of bu&s;ine&s;s is habituated to the action of &s;ome &s;timu|lus afforded by it&s;elf; but this being withdrawn or &s;uper|&s;eded by one of a different kind, derangement and di&s;order are produced, both in body and mind, or in each &s;eperately, according to its power.</P>
<P>In the next piece, I will endeavour to &s;hew, how far the pa&s;&s;ions differ from each other in different temperament; and in the fir&s;t place, it appears, that in a &s;anguine tempe|rament of the body, the pa&s;&s;ions are more violent, yet quick, and in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion more various, the mind is prone to joy, hope and plea&s;ure. In the choleric they are excited with more difficulty, but when brought into action, they are &s;ound to be more permanent and violent than in the &s;an|guine. In the&s;e various emotions of the mind, when once we allow them to make a deep impre&s;&s;ion, their vi&s;its be|come too often repeated; anger and pride principally come under this de&s;cription. In melancholy, the emotions of the mind are never violent, but &s;low and con&s;tant, and always &s;ad, apprehending &s;ome impending evil. The Phlegmatic are &s;eldom, if ever, troubled with exce&s;&s;es of the pa&s;&s;ions of either kind, and &s;eldomer indulge the mo&s;t inoffen&s;ive.</P>
<P>There is &s;o intimate a connection of every di&s;po&s;ition of the mind, with the peculiar temperament of the body, that when ever a &s;pecial di&s;po&s;ition of the body is contracted, by the indulgence of &s;ome one of the pa&s;&s;ions, we nece&s;&s;arily induce a con&s;entaneous temperament of the body; and <HI>vice ver&s;a,</HI> when a particular habit of the body is formed, a pe|culiar di&s;po&s;ition of mind follows.</P>

<P>How far a placid and equable temper of mind contributes to the removal of every fever of an acute kind, mu&s;t be evident to every accurate ob&s;erver of nature.</P>
<P>In &s;low and nervous fevers it is no le&s;s beneficial to re|lieve the mind by in&s;piring hope and adding new vigour to the &s;y&s;tem by the welcome news of joy. In all ob&s;tructions, and more particularly the humoral A&s;thma, it would &s;eem to be a matter of con&s;iderable importance to excite laughter.

<P>Be&s;ides all this, the mind demands no le&s;s attention in the healing of wounds. For the &s;timulating or impelling emotions contribute much to the increa&s;e of inflammation and &s;uppuration; and on the other hand, the debilitating or repelling may and will have a contrary operation. And among the various and many effects of the pa&s;&s;ions upon the

con&s;titution, we mu&s;t not omit to mention of what immen&s;e application they have been in the prevention of an exacer|bation of the intermittent fever, and al&s;o in aiding the &s;y&s;|tem to contend with the contagion of infectious di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P>There are worthy of notice, &s;ome functions of the mind which cannot with the &s;trict rules of order be reduced to the cla&s;s of pa&s;&s;ions, yet of much con&s;equence to the Phy|&s;ician, and as an operation of the mind upon the body, may be &s;ubjoined to what has been mentioned in the foregoing pages. The fir&s;t of the&s;e is a high degree of faith and con|fidence in the efficacy of remedies. Whether this operates by engro&s;&s;ing the mind and attention, and thereby rendering it inacce&s;&s;ible to other impre&s;&s;ions, or by imparting &s;uch a de|gree of tone or &s;trength as enables the &s;y&s;tem to re&s;i&s;t their attacks, is difficult to determine; but I am rather inclined to believe that both are concerned, and that they reciprocally a&s;&s;i&s;t each other. This power is found mo&s;t efficacious in &s;uch di&s;orders as recur at intervals. It however, is ob&s;ervable that unle&s;s the prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion is very great, it is apt to fail in pro|ducing a cure. Another mental affection which has pro|duced wonderful effects, is a determined re&s;olution to re&s;i&s;t the acce&s;s of the complaint. However extraordinary this may &s;eem, yet that it has been practi&s;ed with great &s;ucce&s;s, is a matter beyond doubt. It appears to have its influence in a manner &s;imilar to the power la&s;t &s;poken of, and to have been &s;erviceable in nervous and periodical complaints. This appears to be not only a &s;timulus to the nervous &s;y&s;tem, but al&s;o a general and powerful tonic. And mu&s;t it not be by the agency of this power of the mind, and its influence upon the body that the &s;uppo&s;ed po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of animal mag|neti&s;m effect &s;uch wonderful cures?</P>

the &s;tandard of health, endeavours &s;hould be made to excite into action &s;uch pa&s;&s;ions as will aid in counteracting the leading &s;ymptoms of the di&s;ea&s;e. And when the di&s;ea&s;e it&s;elf con&s;i&s;ts in, or is agravated by too high a degree of ex|citement of the vital functions, recour&s;e may be had to the debilitating ones.</P>
<P>In doing this many difficulties remain yet to be got over, relative to the application of the&s;e potent and precarious in|&s;truments; &s;ince they cannot be brought to Chemical any|li&s;is that we may a&s;certain their real and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed virtues; neither can we form any judgment of their extent or qua|lity, by their effects. For what may have a moderate ope|ration in one economy, may in another be &s;ufficient, to car|ry the &s;y&s;tem above the wi&s;hed for point, and be &s;ucceeded by indirect debility&punc; and &s;ince we are left &s;o much in the dark, upon the manner of applying the&s;e agents, to the re|moval of di&s;ea&s;es, and the difficulty of exciting them, when wanting, I fear it will be an in&s;urmountable barrier to their u&s;e; though we may look forward with plea&s;ure, to the time, when future ages will &s;urmount this ob&s;tacle, and teach us how we are to accommodate the&s;e remedies to the excitability of the &s;y&s;tem.</P>
