<P>MOST of the following pages originally appeared in the FAR|MER'S WEEKLY MUSEUM, a rural paper of Newhamp&s;hire. Surrounded by plain hu&s;bandmen, rather than by poli&s;hed &s;cholars, the Author, both in the &s;elec|tion of his &s;ubjects, and their vehicle, has been more &s;tudious of the u&s;eful, than the brilliant. To in&s;truct the villager, was his primary object. Hence, an ea&s;y and obvious &s;tile was indi&s;pen&s;able. To ri&s;e to the gorgeous phra&s;e of BOLINGBROKE would have been ab&s;urd, to &s;ink to the vulgarity of L'ESTRANGE would have

been ignominious. The familiarity of FRANKLIN's manner, and the &s;implicity of STERNE's proved mo&s;t auxiliary to his de&s;ign. He, therefore, adventured their union. Diffident of &s;ucce&s;s, and pre|pared for cen&s;ure, he will not be &s;urpri&s;|ed at a har&s;h &s;entence from the critical tribunal. The vanity of author&s;hip has already cau&s;ed him to prove the negli|gence of his NATAL TOWN; the &s;ame pa&s;&s;ion now urges him to try the &s;uffra|ges of the COUNTRY. Should this, like former attempts, &s;lide rapidly down the &s;lope of oblivion, it will add the la&s;t item to the catalogue of literary di&s;appoint|ments, and CURE</P>

<HEAD>"TWO ARE BETTER THAN ONE."</HEAD>
<P>THIS is SOLOMON's theory, and I like it; his practice was rather too exten&s;ive, for in his luxurious palace, &s;even hundred wives, and three hundred concubines were better than one. Whether the women of Jeru&s;alem were compo&s;ed of more manageable materials, than modern females, I am at a lo&s;s, for JOSEPHUS, who&s;e works I have turned over to gain infor|mation on this knotty point, &s;ays nothing of the matter. However, I am inclined to think SOL|OMON made his dome&s;tick arrangement &s;oon after he "planted vineyards." Had he cho&s;en a graver moment, he would not have told the mo&s;t confidential of his eunuchs, that &s;even hundred expen&s;ive wives, and three hundred capricious concubines, were better than one. Why the revenues of gold paved Jeru&s;alem, or the bagnios of its &s;uburbs could not have fur|ni&s;hed robes for the married dames, nor rakes for the free! Men, &s;age like SOLOMON, are gen|erally
<PB N="6" REF="030335_0005_0FE5C2A31560B3B8">
moderate in their arithmetick of plea&s;|ures. But this was too bold a &s;um in multipli|cation, even for a polygami&s;t to work.</P>
<P>In all probability, SOLOMON, though the ori|ental writers expatiate upon his re&s;ources, found his &s;tock too &s;canty for the many and great claims, which "the daughters of Jeru&s;alem" mu&s;t have made. For late in life, when the "pitcher" was broken, and the "&s;ilver cord" of love loo&s;ed, and his "de&s;ires failed," we find him gravely compo&s;ing a &s;ententious proverb, in prai&s;e of &s;ociability, and reducing a thou&s;and companions to one. His rea&s;ons too, are not drawn as they would have been, when he form|ed his Seraglio, from pa&s;&s;ion and plea&s;ure, but from <HI>utility.</HI> For he &s;upports his opinion by arguing, in the context, that "two are better than one," becau&s;e in difficulty, or in battle, they mutually a&s;&s;i&s;t, or bedded in a fro&s;ty night, they keep each other warm.</P>
<P>Although, in remarking upon SOLOMON's voluptuou&s;ne&s;s, I have been moved from my natural gravity, as a preacher, yet let not the wanton reader, con&s;true my &s;ermon as a &s;atire upon the &s;age Prince. After animadverting upon the exce&s;s of his practice, it is my inten|tion to echo the benevolence and utility of his &s;ocial principle.</P>
<P>"Two are better than one." Dr. FRANK|LIN thought &s;o, when he recommended early marriages. As I am of &s;ingular continence my&s;elf, I know nothing of the matter, but St.
<PB N="7" REF="030335_0006_0FE5C2A454A59178">
PAUL, an apo&s;tle of experience, tells bachelor and virgin chri&s;tians, that it is better to marry than burn. If they feel this heat, therefore, let them quench it in <HI>legal</HI> couples, and choo&s;e for the wedding ring po&s;y, "Two are better than one." My phy&s;ician declares that in the&s;e de|generate days, when illicit love is common, ear|ly marriage is favourable to <HI>health</HI>; the philo&s;|ophers affirm that it is to <HI>morals.</HI> The Preach|er, therefore, concludes that "two are better than one" applied to matrimony, is a precept productive of <HI>happine&s;s,</HI> and that a young man, who will reject <HI>all</HI> the concubines, and &s;ix hun|dred and ninety nine of the wives, which SOL|OMON thought nece&s;&s;ary, may be pronounced wi&s;er, as it re&s;pects women, than that Prince.</P>
<P>In the dark ages, as they were ju&s;tly &s;tiled, devotional men u&s;ed to think that St. PETER, the porter of Heaven's wicket, would not open it, but to <HI>one</HI> at a time. Accordingly, monks and hermits would wander, or re&s;ide &s;olitary in de&s;arts and caves, and in&s;i&s;t that an error had crept into the proverbs, and that SOLOMON cer|tainly wrote "One is better than two." This was a vile interpretation; and, if they had med|itated their Bibles well, they would have di&s;|covered that the founder of their religion was never &s;o happy, as when "much people" &s;ur|rounded him, and that the Apo&s;tles cho&s;e <HI>com|panions</HI> in their travel; the one &s;at &s;ocially at a wedding &s;upper, and the others re&s;orted to the temples, the <HI>town hall,</HI> and the <HI>market place.</HI></P>

<P>YES, in a world of weak ones, it is our du|ty, it will be our plea&s;ure, and, ye &s;elfi&s;h generation, it will be for our <HI>intere&s;t</HI> too, to yield favors to the wi&s;e, and bread to men of under|&s;tanding. Our patronage will be but rarely ex|erci&s;ed, and few will be the loaves for the&s;e wi&s;e men to devour, for I looked and lo! they are a &s;olitary and &s;canty band, unobtru&s;ive, like the hermit of the mountains.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="030335_0008_0FE5C2A89D33E808">But, though the "man of under&s;tanding" is rarely to be &s;een, and, though it would profit us much under the &s;un, to gather the honey of his lips, &s;uch is our perver&s;ene&s;s, our folly, or our fate, that, untrodden by our "feet," we &s;uf|fer the mo&s;s to gather on the "&s;teps of his door."</P>
<P>My &s;tudy window overlooks the hou&s;e of an eminent phy&s;ician; he under&s;tands accurately, the nice movements of the human machine; he is a botani&s;t, &s;killed in the properties of plants, the cedar of Libanus, and the "hy&s;&s;op on the wall;" he has meditated the &s;y&s;tem of nature, and he has tried many of the proce&s;&s;es of art. I &s;ee him turning over the volumes, which con|tain the &s;ecrets of medicine, and I hear him de|&s;cribe &s;kilfully the various modes to blunt, or to extract, the arrows of di&s;ea&s;e. But alas! my carele&s;s countrymen, "all this availeth him nothing." The blind, the maim and the halt, of our villages, refu&s;e bread to this "man of under&s;tanding," and mea&s;ure their wheat in brimming bu&s;hels, to the quack, who cannot di&s;tingui&s;h between a fever and the gout, who applies his nippers to a wart, and thinks he ex|tracts a cancer, who poi&s;ons you with mercu|rials, curdles your blood with calomel, drenches you with enfeebling teas, and, as a wit once ex|pre&s;&s;ed it, pre&s;cribes draughts &s;o <HI>neutral,</HI> they declare neither for the patient nor the malady. If the Royal Preacher, in who&s;e writings I find my text, had &s;een whole villages, clamorous at
<PB N="10" REF="030335_0009_0FE5C2A9D5EA2B20">
the midnight hour, for a foetid quack, and his powders, and "pa&s;&s;ing by on the other &s;ide," when they &s;ee the regular practitioner, he would have forgotten, for a moment, all the wi&s;dom of the Ea&s;t, and, like provoked PETER, in the Go&s;pel, would "cur&s;e and &s;wear" at &s;uch egre|gious folly.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e of my readers, who will gladly turn out of the paths of error, when they hear a warning voice behind them, "here is a better path, walk therein," will I hope learn the value of "men of under&s;tanding." When their value is once known&mdash;the "&s;teps of their door" will be hour|ly a&s;cended. They will teach us how to think, to &s;peak, and to act. If Divines, they will not attempt to per&s;uade you, that Heaven cannot be taken, but by the violence of Scotch divin|ity. If Lawyers, they will not demand exorbi|tant fees, to &s;upport a rotten cau&s;e. If Phy&s;i|cians, you will hear them utter no words more cramp than "Temperance," and "Regimen." If Morali&s;ts, they will mark the difference be|tween wi&s;dom and cunning, they will point out the weakne&s;s as well as wickedne&s;s of tho&s;e petty frauds, tho&s;e iniquitous contracts, tho&s;e tricking arts of <HI>jockey&s;hip,</HI> &s;o frequent and &s;o di&s;graceful a|mong a rural people, where nought but &s;implici|ty &s;hould be found. To &s;uch divines you will cheerfully vote a more ample annual &s;alary, than &s;ixty pounds, and you will receive in exchange that wi&s;dom, which we are a&s;&s;ured, in a volume of the highe&s;t authority, is better than rubies.</P>

<P>Various philo&s;ophers and naturali&s;ts, have attempted to define <HI>man.</HI> I never was &s;atisfied with their labours: Ab&s;urd to pronounce him a two legged, unfeathered animal, when it is ob|vious he is a <HI>&s;leepy</HI> one. In this world&punc; there is bu&s;ine&s;s enough for every individual. A &s;parkling &s;ky over his head, to admire, a fertile &s;oil under his feet to till, and innumerable ob|jects, u&s;eful and plea&s;ant to cha&s;e. But, &s;uch in general is the provoking indolence of our &s;pecies, that the lives of many, if impartially journalized, might be truly &s;aid to have con&s;i&s;t|ed of a &s;eries of &s;lumbers. Some men are in|fe&s;ted with <HI>day dreams,</HI> as well as by vi&s;ions of the night: They travel a certain in&s;ipid round, like the blind hor&s;e of the mill, and, as BOL|INGBROKE ob&s;erves, perhaps beget others to do the like after them. They may &s;ometimes o|pen their eyes a little, but they are &s;oon dim|med by &s;ome lazy fog, they may &s;ometimes &s;tretch a limb, but its effort is &s;oon pal&s;ied by procra&s;tination. Yawning, amid tobacco fumes, they &s;eem to have no hopes, except that their <HI>bed</HI> will &s;oon be made, and no fears, except that
<PB N="12" REF="030335_0011_0FE5C2AB7438ED50">
their &s;lumbers &s;hall be broken, by bu&s;ine&s;s clamouring at the door.</P>
<P>How tender and affectionate is the reproach|ful que&s;tion of SOLOMON, in the text. When wilt thou ari&s;e out of thy &s;leep? The Jewi&s;h Prince, whom we know to be an active one, from the temple which he erected, and from the books he compo&s;ed, &s;aw, when he ca&s;t his eyes around his city, half his &s;ubjects a&s;leep. Though in many a wi&s;e proverb, he had warn|ed them of the baneful effects of indolence, they were deaf to his charming voice, and blind to his noble example. The men &s;ervants, and the maid &s;ervants whom he hired, nodded over their dome&s;tick duties in the royal kitchen, and when in the vineyards he had planted, he look|ed for grapes, lo they brought forth <HI>wild</HI> grapes, for the vintager was drow&s;y.</P>
<P>At the pre&s;ent time, few SOLOMONS exi&s;t, to preach again&s;t <HI>pillows,</HI> and never was there more occa&s;ion for a &s;ermon. Our country be|ing at peace, not a drum is heard to rou&s;e the &s;lothful. But, though we are exempted from the tumult and vici&s;&s;itudes of war, we &s;hould re|member there are many po&s;ts of duty, if not of danger, and at the&s;e we &s;hould vigilantly &s;tand. If we will &s;tretch the hand of exertion, means to acquire competent wealth, and hone&s;t fame abound, and when &s;uch ends are in view, how &s;hameful to wilfully clo&s;e our eyes. He, who &s;urveys the paths of active life, will find them &s;o numerous and lengthy, that he will feel the
<PB N="13" REF="030335_0012_0FE5C2B0016807F8">
nece&s;&s;ity of early ri&s;ing, and late taking re&s;t, to accompli&s;h &s;o much travel. He, who pants for the &s;hade of &s;peculation, will find that Litera|ture cannot flouri&s;h in the bowers of indolence and monki&s;h gloom. Much midnight oil mu&s;t be con&s;umed, and innumerable pages examined, by him who&s;e object is to be really wi&s;e. Few hours has that man to &s;leep, and not <HI>one</HI> to <HI>loiter</HI> who has many coffers of wealth to fill, or many cells in his memory to &s;tore.</P>
<P>Among the various men, whom I &s;ee in the cour&s;e of my pilgrimage through this world, I cannot frequently find tho&s;e, who are broad a|wake. Sloth, a powerful magician, mutters a witching &s;pell, and deluded mortals tamely &s;uffer this drow&s;y being to bind a fillet over their eyes. All their activity is employed, in turning them|&s;elves like the door, on its <HI>ru&s;ty</HI> hinge, and all the noi&s;e they make in this world is a &s;nore. When I &s;ee one, de&s;igned by nature for noble purpo&s;es, indolently declining the privilege, and heedle&s;s, like ESAU, bartering the birthright, for what is of le&s;s worth than his red pottage of len|tiles, for liberty to &s;it &s;till and lie quietly, I think I &s;ee, not a man, but an oy&s;ter. The drone in &s;ociety, like that fi&s;h, on our &s;hores, might as well be &s;unken in the mud and inclo&s;|ed in a &s;hell, as &s;tretched on a couch, or &s;eated in a chimney corner.</P>
<P>The &s;ea&s;on is now approaching fa&s;t, when &s;ome of the mo&s;t plau&s;ible excu&s;es for a <HI>little more &s;leep</HI> mu&s;t fail. Enervated by indulgence,

He may receive it implicitly, upon the faith both of the phy&s;ician and the Preacher, that morning is friendly to health and the heart, and if the idler is &s;o manacled by the chains of habit, that he can, at <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> do no more, he will do wi&s;e|ly and well to inhale pure air, to watch the ri|&s;ing &s;un, and mark the magnificence of nature.</P>

<P>A CERTAIN writer, though not a Bi&s;hop, has &s;omewhere a&s;&s;erted that the Devil goes about in more plea&s;ing &s;hapes, than that of <HI>a roaring Lion.</HI> It is at tho&s;e &s;ea&s;ons, my readers, when this per&s;onage is di&s;gui&s;ed, or attired in agreeable array, that we &s;hould guard again&s;t his wiles.

But when Satan choo&s;es to walk to and fro in ma&s;|querade through the world, his deformities all hidden, either by a broad mantle, or a flowing robe, then he allures the eye, then he taints the heart.</P>
<P>Now, as we are not ignorant of his devices, and, as MOSES an old authentick hi&s;torian, has apprized us of his &s;ubtlety, it may be u&s;eful to tho&s;e, who carele&s;sly judge of characters from appearance, to de&s;cribe &s;ome of the mo&s;t com|mon &s;hapes, which the Tempter a&s;&s;umes.

<P>A bag of money, for in&s;tance, if, we &s;eek it in company with Integrity and Indu&s;try, is not only a harmle&s;s, but u&s;eful acqui&s;ition.

<P>This is a whim&s;ical age; who would believe that a man could be found, &s;ufficiently bold, and readers, &s;ufficiently credulous, to &s;uppo&s;e that <HI>Favor is not deceitful.</HI></P>
<P>More than forty years &s;ince, when my grand|mother &s;uffered my elder brother to lead me by the hand into company, I was plea&s;ed with all faces. You, charming maid, &s;ays I to a &s;miling la&s;s, have a <HI>benevolent</HI> countenance, you mu&s;t lend a favourable ear to my vows&mdash;a &s;udden co|quetti&s;h wave of her fan, and a &s;corning no&s;e proved that <HI>Favor was deceitful.</HI></P>
<P>A buyer goes into a country &s;tore, and, lean|ing over the counter, a&s;ks the &s;hopkeeper for changeable &s;ilk. He holds up a piece in a fa|vorable point of view, and &s;miling plau&s;ibly, declaims an hour upon its cheapne&s;s and dura|bility. The &s;ilk is bought; when daughter DOLLY had worn it two &s;undays, it was &s;till changeable; &s;potted with bilge water, and torn by a pin, even one eye might read on the hem that <HI>Favour is deceitful</HI>?</P>
<P>I recollect that, during my nonage, I re&s;ted many hopes upon the plau&s;ibility of a &s;imper|ing courtier: He had been educated by the Je&s;uits, noted for giant promi&s;e, and pigmy per|formance. This man had a &s;weet &s;mile and a &s;ilver tongue. His &s;mile and tongue were worth a Prince's ran&s;om to him. He had a wonder|ful

<P>I &s;aw lately a moro&s;e wretch with a book in his hand.

The wild men, whom I now de&s;cribe, it is true, have neither feathers on their heads, nor moggi&s;ons on their feet, jewels are not pen|dent from their no&s;es, nor blankets thrown round their limbs, but &s;till they are dangerous, and <HI>wild</HI> creatures, as much as if they traver&s;ed the woods of Huron, navigated lake Mumphra|magog, or hunted in the Tene&s;ee.</P>
<P>When you hear &s;ix pair of &s;leigh bells jing|ling along the road, about two o'clock in a win|ter morning, when you hear many a drunken cur&s;e from the driver, and learn from a tavern keeper, that the owner of the afore&s;aid &s;leigh and bells, paid twenty &s;hillings club of the rec|oning, he is a wild man, broke loo&s;e from his keeper, and will hardly be tamed.</P>
<P>The prediction, contained in my text, was applied to ISHMAEL, and has been remarkably verified in his de&s;cendants, the Arabs. But this roving and lawle&s;s people, the generality of geographers and chri&s;tians, &s;uppo&s;e confined to the extended plains of A&s;ia, and dream not, that any of the tribe inhabit this continent.

<P>The mention of hor&s;e jockies, "moves me from my natural moderation." As the jockey,

is a very common, and fa&s;hionable character too in mo&s;t villages, his celebrity de&s;erves &s;ome con&s;ideration. The Lay Preacher acknowl|edges that he, like mo&s;t <HI>&s;edentary</HI> par&s;ons, is an aukward rider, and &s;its too much in his ea&s;y chair, to &s;it gracefully on a hor&s;e. Still, as he is plea&s;ed with beauty and grace wherever found, he cannot but be &s;truck with the figure of a no|ble animal, di&s;tingui&s;hed for tho&s;e enchanting qualities. He warmly approves therefore, tho&s;e, who exerci&s;e humanity towards the generous &s;teed, and who to an animal, which &s;afely bears them a rugged journey, are liberal of hay, and &s;paring of the la&s;h. He even allows, to men of property, the indulgence of ta&s;te and whim, in choo&s;ing a creature of &s;o much elegance and u&s;e. But when a man, &s;o far forgets his dignity, as to prefer the &s;table to the parlour, to be the con|&s;tant companion of o&s;tlers, to u&s;e no language but that of the turf, and wear life away in comb|ing a mane, one cannot avoid thinking, that the bea&s;t he curries is the nobler animal. A more &s;erious objection can be made to the profe&s;&s;ed jockey. He not only devotes too much time to the &s;table, but exerci&s;es too much craft, in the purcha&s;e and &s;ale of his favorite animal. He not only like Richard in the play, cries "a hor&s;e, a hor&s;e, a kingdom for a hor&s;e," but deems it not only pardonable but prai&s;eworthy, to get what is called the <HI>advantage.</HI> This phra&s;e means to &s;ell an article, for treble its worth, and to make the bargain, by fal&s;ehood and by fraud!

The jockey and the game&s;ter, have been fre|quently compared, but he who &s;ports with cards, rarely cheats, except when his adver&s;ary is a &s;harper. Even the game&s;ter has too much honor to cajole the weak and un&s;kilful.

Ob&s;ervation has further &s;ugge&s;ted that there are a few, and how few! upon whom the Parent of wi&s;dom has largely be&s;towed that <HI>etherial &s;pirit,</HI> that bold and &s;ublime genius, which he has cho&s;|en to withhold from the majority of mankind.

of order and due &s;ubordination, that, in his epi&s;tle to the Romans, who, under the reign of NERO, would have been gratified by <HI>revolu|tionary</HI> logick, he charges every &s;oul to be &s;ub|ject unto the higher powers. It is worthy of remark, and will &s;hew how important the &s;ubject was con&s;idered by the apo&s;tle, that he maintains the propo&s;ition not by political, but religious arguments, for, after declaring that all power was derived from above, he concludes regularly that re&s;i&s;tance to "ordained" government was oppo&s;ition to the &s;upreme will.</P>
<P>I have examined very carefully this great man's epi&s;tles to various cities of the Ea&s;t, a quarter of the globe coerced by the &s;terne&s;t laws, and cannot find a &s;ingle &s;entence to induce change of officers, or a popular government. Neither Corinthians nor Ephe&s;ians are advi&s;ed to <HI>club</HI> &s;ubordination away. The <HI>funding &s;y&s;tem</HI> of Rome is tacitly approved, for PAUL enjoins a rigorous payment of the publick debt, and if an Amba&s;&s;ador were &s;ent to negotiate a <HI>Treaty</HI> with the faithle&s;s Parthians, or the ho&s;tile Medes, the Saint did not, when the Envoy returned, call upon his god to cur&s;e him, or cur&s;e him him&s;elf.</P>
<P>But &s;uppo&s;e, my countrymen, that we &s;hould con&s;ider it &s;uperfluous, to have a <HI>King,</HI> or what is the &s;ame, good government in <HI>I&s;rael</HI>; and that every man &s;hould be permitted to do what was right in his own eyes.

Thank&s;giving was one of the fir&s;t acts of devotion, de&s;cribed by the &s;acred Hi&s;torian.

<HEAD>"LITTLE CHILDREN, KEEP YOURSELVES FROM IDOLS."</HEAD>
<P>THIS precept of the Evangeli&s;t, was not in|tended for the <HI>nur&s;ery. Infants</HI> of the large&s;t growth, we know have their rattles and "idols," and the "little children," whom JOHN meant to keep &s;afe, were men and women, who had reached the full mea&s;ure of their &s;tature, but who, from levity, might prove too attached to objects "earthly" or "devili&s;h."</P>
<P>A learned commentator upon this pa&s;&s;age, might here exclaim, O blind Lay Preacher, worthy to be cla&s;&s;ed with the <HI>fooli&s;h</HI> Galatians, cannot you perceive that your text was de&s;ign|ed, merely as a warning again&s;t the wor&s;hip of images, &s;et up by the &s;uper&s;tition of Pagans, and that the Gentiles were the little children? This is too partial and narrow an explanation. I am willing to &s;uppo&s;e that JOHN, like other zealous chri&s;tians of that age, was anxious to &s;trip each Roman temple, of its fal&s;e GOD. But the
<PB N="35" REF="030335_0034_0FE5C2DDEB9DC198">
Evangeli&s;t well knew that there were <HI>idols,</HI> the objects of fond adoration, be&s;ides brazen or ivo|ry &s;tatues, of Jupiter and Mercury. In this enlightened period, when altars are no more, and the &s;moke of heathen &s;acrifice no longer a&s;|cends, numerous idols are reverenced; and when the Lay Preacher enumerates their names, all his readers will agree with him, that tho&s;e, who bow the knee to the&s;e <HI>modern</HI> Baals, are "Little children," always weak and &s;ometimes wicked.</P>
<P>A number of pretty women, of my acquaint|ance, have and will, in &s;pite of my le&s;&s;ons, &s;et up a certain &s;mooth faced <HI>idol,</HI> on the top of their toilets. They call it a looking gla&s;s, and wor&s;hip it hourly. This is a mo&s;t pernicious idol; a great cheat of their time, and an artful flatterer of their beauty. They &s;traightway retire, and forget what manner of per&s;ons they &s;hould prove. They forget the fond hu&s;band, and are deaf to the pathetick wailings of the child. They become impatient of every do|me&s;tick duty, and are careful alone, with much care, to be decked in purple, and perfumed with <HI>all powders of the merchant.&mdash;Little</HI> Mi&s;&s;es, li&s;|ten to a friend, break your idol, it is brittle I a&s;|&s;ure you, read in&s;tructive books, and &s;ometimes, on a Sunday, &s;ermons, much better ones I mean, than tho&s;e of the Lay Preacher.</P>

<P>Di&s;&s;ipation being the characteri&s;tick of cities, to travel its round will require &s;o much time that none will be left to cultivate the under|&s;tanding or mend the heart. Whatever &s;ome indolent fine ladies and fine gentlemen may &s;up|po&s;e, we were not &s;ent into this world merely to go to a&s;&s;emblies, to &s;aunter at &s;hops, to purcha&s;e of milliners or undergo the three hours operation of a barber.

<P>AND where is the &s;ullen mortal, who would refu&s;e to obey &s;o plea&s;ant an injunction as this, coming too on the authority of SOLOMON?</P>
<P>However, as this doctrine at fir&s;t view, &s;eems to flatter the indulgence of the pa&s;&s;ions, and therefore to proceed with an ill grace from a moral teacher, let us look narrowly into SOLO|MON's &s;y&s;tem, and endeavor that wi&s;dom may be ju&s;tified of her children.</P>
<P>In one of the mo&s;t intere&s;ting and amu&s;ing Journals that we find in the Bible, SOLOMON has narrated to us the hopes and fears, which agitated his bu&s;y life. Born a monarch he could exerci&s;e &s;upreme power, and a courtier of the mu&s;es he acquired the highe&s;t wi&s;dom His city was magnificent, his &s;ubjects loyal, com|merce wafted him all that was rare from Sidon, and the decks of Tar&s;hi&s;h &s;hips glittered with the pageantry of its peacocks. In a &s;ituation &s;o favorable to enjoyment, it was natural that he &s;hould withhold his heart from no joy, and that the luxury of the Ea&s;t &s;hould excite him to re|fine on plea&s;ure. From his love of letters, his fir&s;t indulgencies were of cour&s;e <HI>mental.</HI> He conned the pithy &s;ayings of Orientals, and fa|tigued his faculties with the &s;chola&s;tick jargon of many a Rabbi. But &s;oon di&s;covering that
<PB N="53" REF="030335_0052_0FE5C2FF673A7EE8">
he was directing his thoughts through a track|le&s;s maze, that if &s;uch ab&s;tru&s;e di&s;qui&s;itions were too eagerly pur&s;ued, wi&s;dom would turn into folly and too much learning make him mad, he re&s;olved to de&s;cend from the pinnacle of &s;peculation, and mix with men in the high|way of life. We then hear of his agricultural experiments, the cares of a numerous hou&s;ehold, and his <HI>publick</HI> works. Through the du&s;ty de|&s;arts of Pale&s;tine, he probably conveyed di&s;tant water to thir&s;ty &s;ubjects, and overarched the brook Cedron with numerous bridges. But the re&s;tle&s;s Prince, when the labors of the day were pa&s;t, and he communed with his own heart in the <HI>inner</HI> chamber of the palace found, in re|flection's &s;ober hour, that this was a &s;ore travail and vexation of &s;pirit. At length, after nume|rous experiments on happine&s;s, he drew a for|mal compari&s;on between the various &s;ituations in life. After &s;tating the accompt of human hope and di&s;appointment, with <HI>clerical</HI> accuracy, that Folly has a funeral &s;plendid as that of the wi&s;e, that the goods of fortune are peri&s;hable, and though attained by indu&s;try may probably de&s;cend to an Idler, that the reign of novelty was pa&s;t, and every object wore the uniform of &s;amene&s;s, he concludes, I think philo&s;ophically, by arguing again&s;t anxiety and enjoining a mod|erate participation of fe&s;tal joys.</P>
<P>From various pa&s;&s;ages, inter&s;per&s;ed through|out the <HI>volume of our belief,</HI> I am pe&s;uaded that chri&s;tianity was de&s;igned to be a <HI>cheerful</HI> &s;y&s;tem.

Mi&s;erable was the perver&s;ion of its precepts by tho&s;e in early time, who believed that none could prove &s;incere votaries, but the moping and the au&s;tere.

that the daughters of EVE had the <HI>exclu&s;ive</HI> right to the globe. The fa&s;hion of this world regulates our per&s;ons no le&s;s than our garb. Fa&s;hion cheri&s;hes a length of hair, at one time, and &s;nips it, at another. An antediluvian in his tent would encourage his beard to &s;weep his brea&s;t.

In the days of CROMWELL, and puritani&s;m, fa&s;hion &s;et|tled the length of countenance, as well as the <HI>width</HI> of con&s;cience.

For, during the

<P>In the infancy of the colony at Plymouth, and at the erection of the Saybrook platform, our emigrant forefathers, rejected, with loathing, the fat luxury of LUTHER, and &s;tarved them|&s;elves on the mean fare of CALVIN.

WIL|LARD's body of divinity was their law and te&s;ti|mony, and reprobate was that &s;inner, who would adventure to read and practice a more gentle and generous &s;y&s;tem. But &s;uch heavy and clanking fetters of the mind, were too irk&s;ome to

Good works were &s;ometimes a&s;&s;ociated with implicit faith, and the piety of our primitive chri&s;tians was not always horror &s;truck at the union. In proce&s;s of time the reign of rigor declined, and now it may be &s;aid the high prerogative of &s;uper&s;tition has become as nugatory as kingly power in France.

HUME and BOLINGBROKE, with elegance and elabora|tion, but with the darke&s;t &s;ophi&s;try, and BOUL+ANGER, an audacious Frenchman, in his "Chri&s;tianity unveiled," have pre&s;umptuou&s;ly attempted to &s;ap the chri&s;tian's fortre&s;s, and now, to repre&s;ent the &s;on of MARY as a mere man, and now as an impo&s;ter.

Jaded with the ob&s;curity of this &s;tudy, his re&s;tle&s;s mind demanded &s;omething new, and he li&s;tened with delight, to the tale of an Ea&s;t-indian Captain, who painted the profits of fac|tor&s;hip, and the brilliancy of "Barbarick pearl and gold." In &s;hort, for to recount all his la|bors, would tire, even the long winded JEREMY TAYLOR, he &s;pent his life in cea&s;ele&s;s changes; he had, at different times, hor&s;es &s;addled for journeys to every part of the continent, and the departure of many an <HI>outward bound</HI> ve&s;&s;el, was delayed by this projecting pa&s;&s;enger.

<HEAD>"YET NO MAN REMEMBERED THAT SAME POOR MAN."</HEAD>
<P>IN the book of Eccle&s;ia&s;tes, we find related in a very familiar and &s;imple apologue, the &s;iege of a certain city. It was little and thinly inhabited, but it was invaded by a powerful King, and menaced by great bulwarks. In&s;tant capture mu&s;t have en&s;ued, had not a certain <HI>poor</HI> man, who&s;e mind was better &s;tocked, than his pur&s;e, delivered, by the wi&s;dom of his plans, the city, and freed the inhabitants from their terrors. Here we naturally anticipate a lively picture of the gratitude of the be&s;ieged, towards this political &s;aviour. Too many &s;tatutes could not be erected in honour of &s;uch gallantry and enterprize, too many &s;hekels of &s;ilver could not be given to relieve the poverty of him who had &s;o well de&s;erved. We might &s;uppo&s;e that the wealthy citizens would pay liberal tithes to one, by whom their all had been &s;aved. Cha&s;te dames and coy virgins, exulting that their purity had not been violated, by a licen|tious &s;oldiery, would naturally crowd around their protector, and the blu&s;hes of a thou&s;and cheeks atte&s;t that mode&s;ty had not been injured. But he, who &s;hould draw this conclu&s;ion, and imagine that even u&s;eful poverty mu&s;t nece&s;&s;a|rily be recompen&s;ed, would prove him&s;elf a ra&s;h and unob&s;erving man. We might allow the benevolence of his own heart, but what &s;hould

we think of his knowledge of the hearts of oth|ers? That men are not always grateful for &s;ig|nal favors, that poverty is ever contemptible, e|ven when accompanied by merit, may be learn|ed in the cour&s;e of every day's experience, may be learned from the &s;equel of the &s;tory, which began this &s;ermon. Though <HI>all</HI> men natives of the be&s;ieged city, had &s;uch occa&s;ion to recollect their benefactor, yet the mortifying conclu&s;ion of the narrative, is, that in the words of my text, <HI>no man remembered that &s;ame poor man!</HI></P>
<P>However penury may be di&s;dained by tho&s;e &s;elfi&s;h ones, whom legacies and avarice have enriched, we find that the be&s;t friend of man a|bounds in benedictions of the poor. In the &s;er|mon on the mount, a much more accurate and eloquent di&s;cour&s;e, than any of MASILLON'S, the <HI>poor in</HI> &s;pirit are e&s;pecially named, and a kingdom promi&s;ed them, &s;urpa&s;&s;ing all the thrones and principalities of Europe. It was not the magnificent palace, it was not the U&s;ur|ers bank, it was the poor man's hovel, it was the rece&s;s, of the forlorn outca&s;t which the &s;on of the carpenter vi&s;ited.

No complaints mu&s;t be heard of the chill of winter mornings, or the &s;hortne&s;s of &s;ummer nights, but as &s;oon as the above <HI>Lamp</HI> begins to glimmer, let them ri&s;e and work. They will &s;oon be convinced that it is &s;o ingen|iou&s;ly contrived, its radiance will not offend the eyes, nor its exhalations taint the lungs, like the vulgar tapers of midnight. If the Lay Preach|er him&s;elf, &s;hould, contrary to his own doctrine, be found &s;noring in his &s;tudy, while his neigh|bours are walking in their vocation, he gives them full permi&s;&s;ion to call a council, and di&s;|mi&s;s him from his office.</P>
<P>In&s;tead of employing the u&s;ual expre&s;&s;ion, of "a happy new year," it would perhaps, be an improvement to vary the phra&s;e, and adapt it to the character of the per&s;on, who is addre&s;|&s;ed.</P>
<P>Thus &s;hould I compliment a man of feeble knees,, who&s;e eyes are red, and who&s;e pur&s;e is impoveri&s;hed by "tarrying late at the wine," I &s;hould wi&s;h him a <HI>&s;ober</HI> year. I &s;hould wi&s;h that his landlord, when the third bowl or bottle is called for, would refu&s;e to tru&s;t, and that the liquor he &s;wallowed, in&s;tead of rai&s;ing, would de|pre&s;s his &s;pirits, and that he might peru&s;e &s;eri|ou&s;ly,

that chapter of the Prophet, which de|nounces "woe to the drunkards of EPHRAIM."</P>
<P>If I meant that a &s;luggard &s;hould enjoy a hap|py year, I &s;hould wi&s;h him an <HI>active</HI> and <HI>labo|rious</HI> one. I would apply to &s;ome noi&s;y team|&s;ter, or &s;ome importunate client, to bellow at his window, at the dawn of day. I would even advance a dollar from my &s;mall &s;alary, to pur|cha&s;e a couple of cocks, to crow him up to exer|tion. The year of the idler, would then un|doubtedly be happy. You would hear from him no complaints of &s;pleen, or nervous di&s;or|ders. He would have no bill to pay the apoth|ecary for pills, to cure indige&s;tion. He would not only "&s;et his things in order on the fir&s;t month," but habit would cau&s;e order to appear throughout his affairs, during the year.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e that I &s;hould tackle a &s;leigh, and go with my wife to Bo&s;ton. I could not fail, ei|ther in the market or &s;ome coffee hou&s;e, of meeting that animal, more re&s;tle&s;s than a hum|ming bird, called a Democrat or Jacobin. If I wi&s;hed him a happy new year, he would in&s;tant|ly conclude that I meant a <HI>revolutionary</HI> one. He would imagine that my wi&s;h involved the abdication of WASHINGTON, the execution of JAY, and the introduction of the Guillotine. Now, as I am a good &s;ubject, and perfectly well &s;atisfied with the pre&s;ent order of things, noth|ing could be farther from my intention. Guarding again&s;t a meaning &s;o mi&s;chievous, I would expre&s;s my annual compliment different|ly,
<PB N="94" REF="030335_0093_0FE5C3BD835B19B0">
and wi&s;h him an <HI>obedient</HI> and <HI>well governed</HI> year. I would interdict him from reading French gazettes, forbid his pronouncing the word "RODESPIERRE," and debar him from noctur|nal clubs, or &s;peeches. The man would infallibly become a good federali&s;t, and his year would be happy.</P>
<P>The wi&s;h for <HI>Gamblers</HI> mu&s;t be expre&s;&s;ed in a very extraordinary and enigmatical manner. In&s;tead of a <HI>happy</HI> new year, it would be the du|ty of their <HI>real</HI> friends to pray that it might be an <HI>unlucky</HI> one.

<P>MEN, who have witne&s;&s;ed the horrors of that tempe&s;tuous and deformed &s;ea&s;on, which by its cold, contracts the body, and by its gloom depre&s;&s;es the mind, naturally feel at the fir&s;t glimp&s;e of warmth, and vegetation an un|de&s;cribable rapture. Even in the mild climates of the Ea&s;t, in the &s;unny gardens of Pale&s;tine, the flight, the &s;hort, and fleeting winter, was con&s;idered an enemy to joy; and SOLOMON congratulates the arrival of SPRING, in a &s;train of uncommon gaiety. In a tone, &s;oft as the &s;ea&s;on, and animated as its plea&s;ures, he exhorts his "fair one" to "ri&s;e," to "come away," and in the open fields to hear the wild mu&s;ick of na|ture, and to ob&s;erve her green and tender tribes, bur&s;ting from the &s;epulchre of cold. This in|vitation
<PB N="96" REF="030335_0095_0FE5C3C398AF1398">
is enforced by a mo&s;t lively de&s;cription of the land&s;cape; and the appropriate metaphors, SOLOMON employs, &s;eem in&s;pired by the very genius of the &s;ea&s;on, and the liquid, and harmo|nious words he &s;elects, are re&s;pon&s;ive to the tur|tle's notes.</P>
<P>If a native of Jeru&s;alem could be thus elated, at the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of &s;pring, after the <HI>milde&s;t</HI> reign of winter, what mu&s;t be the delight of him, who, under our nothern &s;kies, beholds, for more than half the year, a wa&s;te of &s;nows, hears the mid|night howl of the &s;torm, and feels the nitrous needles of a frigid atmo&s;phere, lacerating every pore?</P>
<P>But &s;uppo&s;itions are &s;uperfluous. We need only look at the door of the cottage, or &s;tray in|to the neare&s;t pa&s;ture, to di&s;cern the operation of &s;pring upon the hopes of the hu&s;bandman. Tired of the dull and &s;ullen company of the au&s;tere months, and di&s;gu&s;ted with the chimney corner, which denies room and exerci&s;e to his plough, at the whi&s;tle of the fir&s;t robin, he flies, like "the roe," or the "young hart of Bether," to furrows and fields. The genial &s;un burni&s;hes his manly cheek, the &s;oft and voluptuous air, vivifies his &s;turdy limbs, he &s;urveys the ri&s;ing blade, and anticipates the golden harve&s;t.</P>

&s;hall find her both a provident matron, in pre|paring our nutriment, and a u&s;eful monitor, urging us to toil. As I am entirely of opinion with that Ancient, and with that Poet, who &s;aw his duty in&s;cribed on every leaf, and found a tongue in trees, and books in the running brooks, I think it would not be unprofitable for every man, who looks abroad, to remark that every department both in the animal, and vege|table kingdom is <HI>in action.</HI> Tho&s;e countle&s;s tribes, who during winter, were fa&s;t locked in the chambers of fro&s;t, are now each moment on the wing, and ince&s;&s;antly employed. No pau&s;e can be di&s;cerned in nature's pre&s;ent operations, every energy is awake, and even inert matter progre&s;&s;ing. It &s;eems to me impo&s;&s;ible that an Idler &s;hould rove on our mountains, and not be le&s;&s;oned into indu&s;try. In January, when green corn could not wave, and the violet of our val|lies was unfolded, he might argue him&s;elf into a belief, that to <HI>him</HI> a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of native powers was alike nece&s;&s;ary. But in May, there is a mil|lion incentives to exertion, and not one rea&s;ona|ble excu&s;e for &s;upinene&s;s. Man was de&s;tined to activity, like the other parts of our &s;y&s;tem, and they call on him to lend a helping hand to their labors. The mo&s;t minute drop of &s;ap, ri&s;ing in its tube, and the embryo germ bur&s;ting from bark, to a contemplative li&s;tner, appear to &s;peak and upbraid the &s;lothful man for not be|ing in u&s;eful motion, like them&s;elves.</P>

The other evening, as I was turning over, agreeably to my u&s;ual practice, the pages o &s;cripture, I dwelt with unde&s;cribable plea&s;ure upon certain pa&s;&s;ages in the life of the patriarch ABRAHAM. I had pa&s;&s;ed the afternoon, in what is called modi&s;h company, and yet could not avoid remarking that the extreme &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s of men and women <HI>of the world,</HI> led them, even at a moment when they a&s;&s;embled for o&s;tenta|tious civility, to behave di&s;courteou&s;ly. If &s;uch rudene&s;s, I murmured to my&s;elf, can be tolerat|ed in a refined age, let me view the behaviour of tho&s;e of old time, before dancing ma&s;ters were di&s;covered, and when me&s;&s;age cards were not &s;ent by one Patriarch's lady to another. I found as I expected, that even herdmen and &s;hepherds had as much <HI>genuine</HI> politene&s;s as Lord CHES|TERFIELD, and that a country maiden, the daughter of BETHUEL, the &s;on of MILCAH, could behave with as much propriety, as though &s;he had been educated in a boarding &s;chool. The &s;tory of this pa&s;toral girl's conduct I wi&s;h to tell at large, and that the delicacy of fa&s;hionable readers would allow me, on this occa&s;ion, &s;o much pedantry as to quote the original.

the anxiety of old age, for an e&s;tabli&s;hment for ISAAC, intreats a confidential &s;teward of the hou&s;ehold, that he would not &s;uffer the inexpe|rienced heart of his &s;on to be captivated by the Canaaniti&s;h beauties. At the earne&s;t reque&s;t of the patriarch, the &s;ervant binds him&s;elf to &s;olic|it for ISAAC a wife of his own rank, religion and country. After &s;anctioning this promi&s;e, by one of the mo&s;t tremendous oaths among the Jewi&s;h u&s;ages, he harne&s;&s;es his camels, and de|parts for Me&s;opotamia. On his arrival at the &s;uburbs of Nahor, a city of that country, fatigu|ed with a tedious journey, and tender of his drudging camels, he makes, them kneel by a well of water, to take their nece&s;&s;ary refre&s;hment. In this weary moment, REBEKAH appears; and the fir&s;t accents that fell from the parched tongue of the traveller, were to &s;olicit a little water from the pitcher, which &s;he carried, "<HI>And &s;he made ha&s;te, and let down her pitcher from her &s;houlder, and &s;aid, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink al&s;o.</HI>"</P>

the text, "&s;ervant," begrimed with du&s;t, and hav|ing no claim to her favor. She is a&s;ked for water, which &s;he cheerfully gives, and the carele&s;s read|er will not be aware of the extent of the obliga|tion, if he have not &s;urveyed a map of Pale&s;tine, and adverted to the &s;andine&s;s and thir&s;t of the &s;oil. In that arid region, a brook was a more joyous &s;ight to a panting &s;hepherd, than a bumper would be now to the votary of wine, the invaluable well &s;pring, eagerly &s;ought, and ob|&s;tinately contended for, by different tribes, was, from the nature of the earth, at &s;uch a di&s;tance below the &s;urface, that to obtain water was a work both of toil and time. But, forgetting her home, forgetting her&s;elf, and "di&s;daining little delicacies," &s;he thinks only of the &s;ufferings of the way faring &s;tranger; and with that "<HI>kind charity</HI>" which the Apo&s;tle empha&s;izes, with that genuine, di&s;intere&s;ted civility, <HI>beyond</HI> the Court of Ver&s;ailles, the tedious de&s;cent of the well &s;he repeatedly tries, and the cooling pitch|er imparts, not only to the man, but even to his unpetitioning bea&s;ts. "Drink," &s;ays the gen|erous girl, and, tru&s;t me that I can feel likewi&s;e for your burdened companions, "for I will give thy <HI>camels</HI> drink al&s;o." This was benevolence, &s;uch as is not generally found. It was emi|nently di&s;intere&s;ted, prompt and diffu&s;ive. It was di&s;intere&s;ted; for the tongue which &s;he cooled was not that of a youthful gallant, trol|ling the oily phra&s;es of flattery. He, who drained the pitcher, which the a&s;&s;iduity of RE|BEKAH
<PB N="102" REF="030335_0101_0FE5C3CF2BD3D558">
filled, was an old man, a &s;ervant, and a &s;tranger. It was prompt; for &s;he "ha&s;ted," and &s;he "ran" to do good; and drew water for "all the camels," though the troop con&s;i&s;ted of ten. It was diffu&s;ive; for <HI>they</HI> were minutely regarded, no le&s;s than their proprietor.</P>
<P>I warmly wi&s;h that the manners of many, who deem them&s;elves poli&s;hed, were at the pre&s;|ent day, as excellent as tho&s;e of this primitive well bred woman.

<HEAD>"WATCHMAN, WHAT OF THE NIGHT?"</HEAD>
<P>TO this query of ISAIAH the watchman makes, I think, but a &s;imple reply; and tells the prophet what, if he had the lea&s;t &s;mat|tering
<PB N="103" REF="030335_0102_0FE5C3D6DA59A6B8">
of a&s;tronomy, he mu&s;t have well known before, "That the morning cometh, and al&s;o the night." Any old Almanack could have &s;aid as much. I think that night, however &s;ooty and illfavoured it may be pronounced by tho&s;e who were born under a day &s;tar, merits a more par|ticular de&s;cription. I feel peculiarly di&s;po&s;ed to arrange &s;ome ideas in favour of this &s;ea&s;on. I know that the majority are literally <HI>blind</HI> to its merits, they mu&s;t be prominent indeed to be di&s;cerned by the <HI>clo&s;ed</HI> eyes of the &s;norer, who thinks that night was made for nothing but &s;leep. But the &s;tudent and the &s;age are wil|ling to believe that it was formed for higher pur|po&s;es; and that it not only recruits exhau&s;ted &s;pirits, but &s;ometimes informs inqui&s;itive, and a|mends&punc; wicked ones.</P>
<P>Duty, as well as inclination, urges the Lay Preacher to &s;ermonize, while others &s;lumber. To read numerous volumes in the morning, and to ob&s;erve various characters at noon, will leave but little time, except the night, to dige&s;t the one or &s;peculate upon the other. The night, there|fore, is often dedicated to compo&s;ition, and while the light of the paly planets di&s;covers at his de&s;k the Preacher, more wan than they, he may be heard repeating emphatically with Dr. YOUNG,
"Darkne&s;s has much Divinity for me."
He is then alone, he is then at peace. No com|panions near, but the &s;ilent volumes on his

&s;helf, no noi&s;e abroad, but the click of the vil|lage clock, or the bark of the village dog. The Deacon has then &s;moked his &s;ixth, and <HI>la&s;t</HI> pipe, and a&s;ks not a que&s;tion more, concerning JO|SEPHUS, or the Church. Stillne&s;s aids &s;tudy, and the Sermon proceeds. Such being the ob|ligations to night, it would be ungrateful not to acknowledge them. As my watchful eyes can di&s;cern its dim beauties, my warm heart &s;hall feel, and my prompt pen &s;hall de&s;cribe, the u&s;es and the plea&s;ures of the nocturnal hour.</P>
<P>Watchman, what of the night? I can with propriety, imagine this que&s;tion addre&s;&s;ed to my&s;elf, I am a profe&s;&s;ed Lucubrator, and who &s;o well qualified to delineate the &s;able hours, as
"A meagre, mu&s;e rid mope, adu&s;t and thin."
However injuriou&s;ly night is treated by the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">leepy moderns, the vigilance of the antients could not overlook its benefits and joys. In as early a record, as the book of Gene&s;is, I find that ISAAC, though he devoted his a&s;&s;iduous days to action, re&s;erved &s;peculation till night. "He went out to meditate in the field at the eventide." He cho&s;e that &s;ad, that &s;olemn hour, to reflect upon the virtues of a beloved and departed mother. The tumult and glare of day &s;uited not with the &s;orrow of his &s;oul. He had lo&s;t his mo&s;t amiable, mo&s;t genuine friend, and his uno&s;tentatious grief was eager for privacy and &s;hade. Sincere &s;orrow rarely &s;uffers its tears to be &s;een. It was natural for ISAAC to
<PB N="105" REF="030335_0104_0FE5C3D95BFCEAC0">
&s;elect a &s;ea&s;on to weep in, which &s;hould re&s;em|ble "the colour of his fate." The darkne&s;s, the &s;olemnity, the &s;tillne&s;s of eve were favorable to his melancholy purpo&s;e. He for&s;ook therefore the bu&s;tling tents of his father, the plea&s;ant "&s;outh country," and "well of Lahairoi," he went out and pen&s;ively meditated at the eventide.</P>
<P>The Grecian and Roman philo&s;ophers firmly believed that "the dead of midnight is the noon of thought." One of them is beautifully de|&s;cribed by the Poet, as &s;oliciting knowledge from the &s;kies, in private and nightly audience, and that neither his theme, nor his nightly walks were for&s;aken till the &s;un appeared and dimmed his "nobler intellectual beam." We undoubt|edly owe to the &s;tudious nights of the ancients mo&s;t of their elaborate and immortal produc|tions. Among them it was nece&s;&s;ary that every man of letters &s;hould trim the midnight lamp. The day might be given to the Forum or the Circus, but the night was the &s;ea&s;on for the State&s;man to project his &s;chemes, and for the Po|et to pour his ver&s;e. Night has likewi&s;e with great rea&s;on been con&s;idered in every age as the a&s;tronomer's day. <HI>Young</HI> ob&s;ervers, with energy, that "an <HI>undevout a&s;tronomer is mad.</HI>" The privilege of contemplating tho&s;e brilliant and numerous myriads of planets which bedeck our &s;kies is peculiar to night, and it is our duty, both as lovers of moral and natural beauty, to ble&s;s that &s;ea&s;on, when we are indulged with
<PB N="106" REF="030335_0105_0FE5C3DA259E0910">
&s;uch a gorgeous di&s;play of glittering and u&s;eful light. It mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed that the &s;eclu&s;ion, calmne&s;s, and tranquility of midnight, is mo&s;t friendly to &s;erious and even airy contempla|tions. Milton, in one of his poems, &s;ays fer|vently
<Q><L>Let my lamp, at midnight hour,</L>
<L>Be &s;een in &s;ome high lonely tower</L>
<L>&mdash;To unfold</L>

<L>Th' immortal mind, that hath for&s;ook</L>
<L>Her man&s;ion in this fle&s;hly nook.</L></Q></P>
<P>The rigid Dr. JOHNSON was &s;o convinced that late hours were auxiliary to the <HI>fea&s;t of rea|&s;on and the flow of &s;oul,</HI> that he u&s;ed to declare "no man, but a &s;coundrel went to bed before midnight." This expre&s;&s;ion was perhaps too &s;trong, and he would not have u&s;ed it, had he lived in a farm hou&s;e.

<P>Beginning! continued I, is like JOHN BUN|YAN's hill, &s;o <HI>difficult</HI> that it would po&s;e even a chri&s;tian to get fairly over. Beginning!

<P>One of my pari&s;hioners, a very indu&s;trious and thriving cobler, who &s;upports a wife, "<HI>nine &s;mall children, and one at the brea&s;t,</HI>" by his la|bour of leather, I knew, "even from his boyi&s;h days." At fourteen he &s;ang wicked ballads to his fellow apprentices, drank raw rum, in a frol|ick, out of the old &s;hoes of the &s;hop, and burnt the boots of the cu&s;tomers. At twenty one, three benevolent maidens complained of him to the '&s;quire, and he was obliged to pawn his <HI>freedom &s;uit,</HI> to indemnify the pari&s;h. He next commenced a <HI>roaring</HI> blade, drank flip before breakfa&s;t, laid out his heel tap money in tobac|co, and the tavern clock &s;truck one, when he told the la&s;t negro &s;tory. At length, he picked up Dr. FRANKLIN'S "Poor Richard," and found that this was not "The way to Wealth."

all the Fathers of the Church have punned, Ah, Mr. CRISPIN, how much more profitable is your <HI>end,</HI> than your beginning.</P>
<P>PALEY, an Archdeacon of the Church, and, what is much better, a worthy man, tells us, in his book of philo&s;ophy, that there is a great dif|ference between beginning with a thou&s;and pounds, and ending with a hundred, and the rever&s;e. It is of much import, therefore, if we mean to end well, that we &s;hould begin tolera|bly. I know no better beginning for a young man, than a <HI>&s;tock</HI> of hone&s;ty, prudence, and in|du&s;try. It is better than &s;tock in the &s;hop, or a thou&s;and pounds from a rich father. If a man &s;hould take it into his head to <HI>begin</HI> with knavery and theft, it cannot be di&s;&s;embled, though the words of SOLOMON are again&s;t me, that there are <HI>ignominious</HI> ends, and if Hemp grew in Jeru|&s;alem, he ought to know it, if not, I proceed to inform him that a <HI>rope's end,</HI> is one of the mo&s;t pitiful terminations in life. Neither "better," not be&s;t can be predicted of &s;uch an "end," even by the accuracy of his logick. 'Tis a vile end, and, you tricki&s;h jockies, be not in &s;uch ha&s;te to put off your &s;pavined hor&s;es, for double their worth to the believing buyer.

<HEAD>"GREAT IS DIANA OF THE EPHESIANS."</HEAD>
<P>THE u&s;ual exclamation of prejudice, igno|rance or enthu&s;ia&s;m in every age.</P>
<P>In the Acts of the Apo&s;tles, the occa&s;ion of this phra&s;e is plea&s;antly recorded. St. PAUL and his colleagues, perceiving the ab&s;urdities of the Pagan &s;y&s;tem, ventured to expo&s;e the futility of the heathen wor&s;hip, and to point out a bet|ter "way" to the heavenly country. But the manufacturers of idols, terribly alarmed at an innovation, which would probably abridge, if not de&s;troy the profits of their trade, immediate|ly convened, though not to deliberate, but to dogmatize. For in&s;tead of rea&s;oning coolly up|on the &s;ubject, and attempting to prove to the populace, the cele&s;tial origin of their godde&s;s, and the active concern &s;he took in the affairs of mortals, they gave a loo&s;e to their pa&s;&s;ions, be|came full of wrath, and bawled out that DIANA was <HI>great,</HI> without once &s;hewing why. Of all that hotheaded multitude, perhaps not an indi|vidual had Geography enough to a&s;certain the &s;ite of Ephe&s;us, or Hi&s;tory enough to inform him of the adventures, or exploits of DIANA. <HI>Craft&s;men</HI> had told the ignorant crowd a pomp|ous tale, to allure them to the <HI>&s;ilver &s;hrines,</HI> and they believed, without examination.</P>
<P>I heartily wi&s;h, that this cry of enthu&s;ia&s;m had cea&s;ed with the &s;uper&s;tition of the ancients. But noi&s;es of this nature &s;till tingle in our ears,
<PB N="125" REF="030335_0124_0FE5C40CC8891EA0">
and a town clerk, at the pre&s;ent day, like his temperate predece&s;&s;or at Ephe&s;us, could not walk in the market place out of hearing of "Great is DIANA," or &s;ome other &s;ound, equal|ly as ridiculous.</P>
<P>Whether it proceeds from the warm climate in which they live, or the bri&s;k champagne they drink, I know not, but the <HI>French</HI> are &s;ingular|ly prone to momentary fits of enthu&s;ia&s;m, almo&s;t bordering on convul&s;ions. They are a very voluble and clamorous race, and if they take it into their heads to like DIANA, they will &s;wear, not without ge&s;tures, that &s;he is <HI>great,</HI> though all others affirm &s;he is <HI>little.</HI> MONTESQUIEU might rea&s;on, or ROUSSEAU might harrangue, but the French would not hear, if tho&s;e &s;an|guinary craft&s;men, MARAT and ROBESPIERRE, &s;hould &s;ummon them to the Convention, or the Champ de Mars, to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate a King, or to de|&s;troy a government. Trifles, like the&s;e, would be "light as air" to a Frenchman, if an in&s;idi|ous de&s;perado bawled in his ears the greatne&s;s and the glory of liberty and equal rights. One unlucky day, they &s;et up a certain &s;cowling im|age, denominated, in their pretty and liquid language, the Guillotine. This to be &s;ure had a &s;hrine, rather of &s;teel than &s;ilver and bowed <HI>heads,</HI> rather than bended knees were the modes of adoration. Tho&s;e unlucky &s;ubjects, who during a life of loyalty, had been much in the habit of crying Great is the King, were &s;oon of|fered up as a <HI>Jewi&s;h &s;acrifice,</HI> for times were
<PB N="126" REF="030335_0125_0FE5C4134FCF2650">
changed, and they &s;hould have &s;aid great is "the <HI>Mountain!</HI>"</P>
<P>A degree conferred by a college is a DIANA, who&s;e divinity many a dunce has acknowledged. College <HI>honors,</HI> as they are termed by <HI>the craft&s;|men,</HI> often operate like amulets and charms, and protect a pedant from the warfare of wit and ridicule. They are a &s;pecies of &s;alt, which has &s;aved many a weak and decaying brain, from putrefaction. Not a graduate from Cambridge, but vaunts of of his Alma mater, and cries, how pre&s;cient, how witty, and how wi&s;e is the Uni|ver&s;ity! A &s;ceptick might doubt the greatne&s;s of this our <HI>learned</HI> DIANA. Its fore knowledge con&s;i&s;ts in predicting invi&s;ible eclip&s;es of the moon, its wit lies at the bottom of a &s;yllogi&s;m, and its wi&s;dom watches the weathercocks, and compiles a bill of mortality!</P>
<P>Some have thought that the <HI>Cambridge</HI> DI|ANA, did not de&s;erve to be <HI>wor&s;hipped</HI> by the <HI>learned</HI> world. I was once a&s;ked by an inqui&s;i|tive foreigner, in what alcove of our Univer&s;ity were depo&s;ited its own works. It is agreed, &s;ays he, that a College is de&s;igned to read and write in. Doubtle&s;s many of your Profe&s;&s;ors were Poets; among your Tutors I expect to hear of a CICERO, and the invention of &s;o elevated a character as a Pre&s;ident, mu&s;t certainly have produced a Folio in every &s;cience. My un|bounded affection for the College, where I had the honor to pay &s;ome three or four hundred pounds, for in&s;truction in the fir&s;t elements of
<PB N="127" REF="030335_0126_0FE5C41501832178">
&mdash;<HI>nothing.</HI> My tenderne&s;s for the character of in&s;tructors of the mo&s;t bland and accommodating humour, and my zeal for the literary renown of the mo&s;t fa&s;hionable &s;eminary in my country, urged my &s;ilence to this query of the &s;tranger, concerning a &s;ubject &s;o delicate. Dear, and learned Sir, I replied, the works of the Univer|&s;ity are not confined within the narrow precincts of an alcove. The works of the Univer&s;ity Sir, are, &s;een, are &s;een&mdash;on <HI>commencement</HI> days. They are diffu&s;ed throughout&mdash;I wi&s;h I knew where, except in the form of <HI>&s;tewards' bills,</HI> I muttered to my&s;elf. The gentleman, perceiving my he&s;itation, and being a man of great curio&s;ity, and anxious to hear me quote brilliant couplets, from &s;ome Univer&s;ity Laureat, or whole orations of &s;ome eloquent Tutor, now in&s;i&s;ted upon a categorical an&s;wer. I therefore, in a &s;uppre&s;&s;ed voice, broken by many &s;obs, the tears running down my cheeks, and with a world of apologies, was compelled to reveal to him the nakedne&s;s of literature at Cambridge. To his a&s;toni&s;hment, and to my &s;orrow, I narrated facts, "pitiful, wondrous pitiful," like OTHEL|LO's &s;ufferings. I informed him that the Tu|tors, far from being eloquent, like the orators of antiquity, were in general &s;uch raw boys, that they were obliged to &s;pell out, even the &s;tated prayer, from the confu&s;ed breviary of evening recollection. That the elaborate trifling of one Profe&s;&s;or, was protracted through five lectures, to &s;hew his pupils what a verb was&mdash;no<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">.

another, in his divinity chair, would in&s;ult his hearers with the &s;illy miracles of POLYCARP, and in his publick exerci&s;es purloin from LELAND, the materials of a funeral eulogy. That Phi|lo&s;ophy was pedlared out by the penny worth, and the &s;treams of learning, in&s;tead of being cheaply and ea&s;ily conducted to each &s;tudent, were &s;old, in their <HI>muddie&s;t &s;tate,</HI> for a higher price than mineral water. That I never heard that any of the College Principals, were ever Poets or Painters, or produced any work more meritorious than a Greek Grammar. That &s;ome were of &s;uch dubious ta&s;te as to reject from the College Library, the works of STERNE and SWIFT, and to commence, at the age of fifty, the &s;tudy of the Briti&s;h Poets as a <HI>ta&s;k reading</HI>! I informed my friend, that the be&s;t and bright|e&s;t &s;cholars from Dr. MAYHEW, to the pre&s;ent time, were generally ignominiou&s;ly puni&s;hed for no other crime than that of volatility. I added that if any incorrigible dunce wi&s;hed to hide his length of ear, by a &s;quare hat academical, if dray hor&s;es &s;ought a &s;helter, or the King of Spain's fourfooted and <HI>braying</HI> &s;ubjects a dormitory, I could ea&s;ily mark the place. But for a youth of lively parts and &s;anguine temperament, place him between the upper and nether mill &s;tone, rather than on his knees before the <HI>leaden</HI> &s;hrine of our <HI>Great</HI> DIANA of <HI>Literature.</HI></P>

<HEAD>"YET DID NOT THE CHIEF BUTLER REMEM|BER JOSEPH BUT FORGAT HIM."</HEAD>
<P>A MOST unlucky in&s;tance of &s;hortne&s;s of memory, and a &s;trange one too, for Jo|&s;eph had expre&s;sly &s;tipulated with the impri&s;|oned butler, that he &s;hould recollect the favor|able interpreter of his dream, and obtain from PHARAOH an order for his enlargement.</P>
<P>Forgat him! Is it po&s;&s;ible? Did the chief butler, as he filled the cup to PHARAOH, ta&s;te the wine &s;o often, that it made him &s;tupid or mad? Was the vine Juice of Egypt, ever mix|ed with poppy water, that it might, like the fa|bled river of oblivion, drown Memory and her tribes? As I know of no ancient record, that alludes to this practice, and in the biography with which MOSES has indulged us, of the chief butler, not a &s;yllable is &s;aid, concerning his debauchery, I believe that the &s;uppo&s;ition that he was a toper, mu&s;t be waved. We mu&s;t look a little deeper than the bottom of a gla&s;s, or even a bottle, to di&s;cover the &s;ource of a courtier's ingratitude.</P>
<P>Let us look, therefore, once more into the book of Gene&s;is, and I tru&s;t, that &s;o lucid an Hi&s;torian as MOSES, will &s;hed light upon this &s;ombre &s;ubject.</P>
<P>It appears that JOSEPH, &s;u&s;pected of an at|tempt upon the <HI>virtue</HI> of POTIPHAR's wife, was, by the in&s;tigation of that <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> of an|tiquity,
<PB N="130" REF="030335_0129_0FE5C418B0F6DDC8">
committed to pri&s;on. According to the &s;acred text, this was a <HI>State</HI> pri&s;on, a kind of Egyptian <HI>Ba&s;tile,</HI> where, as we read, "<HI>The King's pri&s;oners were bound,</HI>" where meaner fel|ons were excluded, and none were admitted, but &s;uch courtiers and retainers to the palace, as had, by their carele&s;&s;ne&s;s or their crimes, forfeited the royal favor. It is no great wonder then that a couple of trade&s;men, who had &s;uch frequent temptations to cheat, as a butler and a baker, &s;hould be put in ward. Light bread and &s;our wine had been vended in the palace, and the abu&s;ed palate of PHARAOH was offend|ed. JOSEPH, who had ingratiated him&s;elf with the chief goaler, was appointed a &s;ort of deputy, or turnkey of the pri&s;on, and had the charge of the&s;e very delinquents.</P>
<P>One morning, "<HI>Behold they were &s;ad</HI>;" and, when interrogated, concerning the cau&s;e of their gloom, they informed JOSEPH that they had dreamed, and there was no interpreter. The chief butler then related, that he had &s;een in a vi&s;ion a clu&s;tered vine, of triple branches, who&s;e grapes he pre&s;&s;ed into the cup, and gave into the hand of PHARAOH. JOSEPH, after com|forting the pri&s;oner by familiarly explaining his dream, and promi&s;ing him re&s;toration to his po&s;t in the hou&s;ehold, pathetically be&s;eeches him that he would in his pro&s;perity reflect on his unju&s;tly accu&s;ed friend, and mention him to his prince. "Think on me," &s;ays the beauti|fully &s;imple original, "when it &s;hall be well
<PB N="131" REF="030335_0130_0FE5C41D821EB980">
with thee, and &s;hew kindne&s;s I pray thee, unto me, and make mention of me to PHARAOH, and bring me out of this hou&s;e." This was &s;urely an ea&s;y &s;ervice; and on the third day, when PHARAOH fea&s;ted his &s;ervants, when, amid the jollity of an entertainment, the relea&s;ed butler &s;tood at the elbow of his appea&s;ed &s;overeign, what a favorable moment to &s;ugge&s;t the proprie|ty of loo&s;ing poor JOSEPH, who had been &s;o unju&s;tly bound. But mark an ob&s;equious, cal|lous, cou<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">tly &s;lave. Intent alone upon his own pro&s;perity, he is &s;o bu&s;y in filling the ruddy cup for his king and for <HI>him&s;elf,</HI> that not a thought of him intrudes, who has nothing to drink, but his own tears and the waters of affliction. A &s;elfi&s;h and ungrateful man, though he &s;hould outlive the olde&s;t of the patriarchs, and allay the thir&s;t of a lineage of Egyptian monarchs, would not once think of his benefactor, nor call to mind that <HI>vi&s;ionary</HI> vine, which he had &s;een in adver&s;ity. No; a chief butler would have much more lucrative employment than think|ing upon the "<HI>Sorrowful &s;ighing of a pri&s;oner.</HI>" A chief butler did not remember JOSEPH, but forgat him.</P>
<P>Are there not a thou&s;and <HI>worldly</HI> rea&s;ons for this forgetfulne&s;s? <HI>Prudence</HI> might whi&s;per to the butler as he walked through the pri&s;on gate, not to li&s;p the name of JOSEPH, for po&s;&s;ibly it might anger PHARAOH, and then his favor would be withdrawn, and <HI>the butler&s;hip!</HI> Be|&s;ides we &s;hould remember, that this dreamer in

pri&s;on, was a very courtier in the palace. Watch|ful enough of his own, and "dealing out his <HI>promi&s;es</HI> as liberally as his liquor." When JO|SEPH had unravelled his entangled dreams, and foretold that he &s;hould again have the keys of PHARAOH's beaufet and cellar, I dare affirm that the butler with cringing complai&s;ance, with low bows and perpetual &s;mile, engaged upon his <HI>honor</HI> not merely to remember, but to renume|rate his deliveer. This was the promi&s;e of a courtier &mdash;And who is ignorant that his engage|ments like "your humble &s;ervant," at the bot|tom of a challenge, mean, if they have any meaning, nothing but death and de&s;truction?&mdash; Many are the promi&s;es of the <HI>chief butlers,</HI> the CHESTERFIELDS, the &s;mooth tongued men of the world. They <HI>keep</HI> them too.
