<HEAD>THE FEDERALIST: ADDRESSED TO THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW-YORK.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="number">
<HEAD>NUMBER I. Introduction.</HEAD>
<P>AFTER an unequivocal experience of the ineffi|cacy of the &s;ub&s;i&s;ting federal government, you are called upon to deliberate on a new con&s;titution for the United States of America. The &s;ubject &s;peaks its own importance; comprehending in its con&s;equences, nothing le&s;s than the exi&s;tence of the UNION, the &s;afety and welfare of the parts of which it is com|po&s;ed, the fate of an empire, in many re&s;pects, the mo&s;t intere&s;ting in the world. It has been frequently remarked, that it &s;eems to have been re&s;erved to the people of this country, by their conduct and example, to decide the important que&s;tion, whether &s;ocieties of men are really capable or not, of e&s;tabli&s;hing good government from reflection and choice, or whether they are forever de&s;tined to depend, for their political con&s;titutions, on accident and force. If there be any truth in the remark, the cri&s;is, at which we are arrived, may with propriety be regarded as the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ra in which
<PB N="2" REF="021127_0007_0FB23B7C4C00D0A0">
that deci&s;ion is to be made; and a wrong election of the part we &s;hall act, may, in this view, de&s;erve to be con&s;idered as the general misfortune of mankind.</P>
<P>This idea will add the inducements of philanthropy to tho&s;e of patrioti&s;m to heighten the &s;olicitude, which all con&s;iderate and good men mu&s;t feel for the event. Happy will it be if our choice &s;hould be directed by a judicious e&s;timate of our true intere&s;ts, unperplexed and unbia&s;&s;ed by con&s;iderations not connected with the public good. But this is a thing more ardently to be wi&s;hed, than &s;eriou&s;ly to be expected. The plan offered to our deliberations, affects too many particular intere&s;ts, innovates upon too many local in&s;titutions, not to involve in its di&s;cu&s;&s;ion a variety of objects foreign to its merits, and of views, pa&s;&s;ions and prejudices little favourable to the di&s;covery of truth.</P>
<P>Among the mo&s;t formidable of the ob&s;tacles, which the new con&s;titution will have to encounter, may readily be di&s;tingui&s;hed the obvious intere&s;t of a cer|tain cla&s;s of men in every &s;tate to re&s;i&s;t all changes which may hazard a diminution of the power, emo|lument and con&s;equence of the offices they hold under the &s;tate-e&s;tabli&s;hments&mdash;and the perverted ambition of another cla&s;s of men, who will either hope to ag|grandi&s;e them&s;elves by the confu&s;ions of their country, or will flatter them&s;elves with fairer pro&s;pects of ele|vation from the &s;ubdivi&s;ion of the empire into &s;everal partial confederacies, than from its union under one government.</P>
<P>It is not, however, my de&s;ign to dwell upon ob&s;er|vations of this nature. I am well aware that it would be di&s;ingenuous to re&s;olve indi&s;criminately the oppo|&s;ition of any &s;et of men (merely becau&s;e their &s;ituations might &s;ubject them to &s;u&s;picion) into intere&s;ted or ambitious view<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&punc; Candour will oblige us to admit, that even &s;uch men may be actuated by upright inten|tions; and it cannot be doubted, that much of the oppo&s;ition which has made its appearance, or may
<PB N="3" REF="021127_0008_0FB23B7D457A67A0">
hereafter make its appearance, will &s;pring from &s;ources, blamele&s;s at lea&s;t, if not re&s;pectable, the hone&s;t errors of minds led a&s;tray by preconceived jealou&s;ies and fears. So numerous indeed and &s;o powerful are the cau&s;es, which &s;erve to give a fal&s;e bias to the judgment, that we upon many occa&s;ions, &s;ee wi&s;e and good men on the wrong as well as on the right &s;ide of que&s;tions, of the fir&s;t magnitude to &s;ociety. This circum&s;tance, if duly attended to, would furni&s;h a le&s;&s;on of mode|ration to tho&s;e, who are ever &s;o thoroughly per&s;uaded of their being in the right, in any controver&s;y. And a further rea&s;on for caution, in this re&s;pect, might be drawn from the reflection, that we are not always &s;ure, that tho&s;e who advocate the truth are influenced by purer principles than their antagoni&s;ts. Ambition, avarice, per&s;onal animo&s;ity, party oppo&s;ition, and many other motives, not more laudable than the&s;e, are apt to operate as well upon tho&s;e who &s;upport as upon tho&s;e who oppo&s;e the right &s;ide of a que&s;tion. Were there not even the&s;e inducements to modera|tion, nothing could be more ill judged than that in|tolerant &s;pirit, which has, at all times, characteri&s;ed political parties. For, in politics as in religion, it is equally ab&s;urd to aim at making pro&s;elytes by fire and &s;word. Here&s;ies in either can rarely be cured by per&s;ecution.</P>
<P>And yet however ju&s;t the&s;e &s;entiments mu&s;t appear to candid men, we have already &s;ufficient indications, that it will happen in this as in all former ca&s;es of great national di&s;cu&s;&s;ion. A torrent of angry and malignant pa&s;&s;ions will be let loo&s;e. To judge from the conduct of the oppo&s;ite parties, we &s;hall be led to conclude, that they will mutually hope to evince the ju&s;tne&s;s of their opinions, and to increa&s;e the number of their converts by the loudne&s;s of their declamations, and by the bitterne&s;s of their invectives. An enlight|ened zeal for the energy and efficiency of government will be &s;tigmati&s;ed, as the off-&s;pring of a temper fond of de&s;potic power and ho&s;tile to the principles of li|berty.
<PB N="4" REF="021127_0009_0FB23B7EC5BCBC18">
An over&s;crupulous jealou&s;y of danger to the rights of the people, which is more commonly the fault of the head than of the heart, will be repre&s;ented as mere pretence and artifice; the &s;tale bait for popu|larity at the expence of public good. It will be for|gotten, on the one hand, that jealou&s;y is the u&s;ual concomitant of violent love, and that the noble en|thu&s;ia&s;m of liberty is too apt to be infected with a &s;pirit of narrow and illiberal di&s;tru&s;t. On the other hand, it will be equally forgotten, that the vigour of govern|ment is e&s;&s;ential to the &s;ecurity of liberty; that, in the contemplation of a &s;ound and well informed judg|ment, their intere&s;ts can never be &s;eparated; and that a dangerous ambition more often lurks behind the &s;pecious ma&s;k of zeal for the rights of the people, than under the forbidding appearances of zeal for the firmne&s;s and efficiency of government. Hi&s;tory will teach us, that the former has been found a much more certain <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oad to the introduction of de&s;poti&s;m, than the latter, and that of tho&s;e men who have overturned the liberties of republics the greate&s;t number have begun their carreer, by paying an ob&s;equious court to the people, commencing demagogues and ending tyrants.</P>
<P>In the cour&s;e of the preceeding ob&s;ervations I have had an eye, my fellow citizens, to putting you upon your guard again&s;t all attempts, from whatever quarter, to influence your deci&s;ion in a matter of the utmo&s;t moment to your welfare by any impre&s;&s;ions, other than tho&s;e which may re&s;ult from the evidence of truth. You will, no doubt, at the &s;ame time, have collected from the general &s;cope of them that they proceed from a &s;ource not unfriendly to the new con&s;titution. Yes, my countrymen, I own to you, that, after having given it an attentive con&s;ideration, I am clearly of opinion, it is your intere&s;t to adopt it. I am con|vinced, that this is the &s;afe&s;t cour&s;e for your liberty, your dignity, and your happine&s;s. I affect not re&s;erves, which I do not feel. I will not amu&s;e you with an
<PB N="5" REF="021127_0010_0FB23B80458F2C08">
appearance of deliberation, when I have decided. I frankly acknowledge to you my convictions, and I will freely lay before you the rea&s;ons on which they are founded. The conciou&s;ne&s;s of good intentions di&s;dains ambiguity. I &s;hall not however multiply profe&s;&s;ions on this head. My motives mu&s;t remain in the depo&s;itary of my own brea&s;t: My arguments will be open to all, and may be judged of by all. They &s;hall at lea&s;t be offered in a &s;pirit, which will not di&s;grace the cau&s;e of truth.</P>
<P>I propo&s;e in a &s;eries of papers, to di&s;cu&s;s the follow|ing intere&s;ting particulars&mdash;<HI>The utility of the UNION to your political pro&s;perity.&mdash;The in&s;ufficiency of the pre|&s;ent confederation to pre&s;erve that Union.&mdash;The nece&s;&s;ity of a government at lea&s;t equally energetic with the one propo&s;ed to the attainment of this object&mdash;The conformity of the propo&s;ed con&s;titution to the true principles of repub|lican government.&mdash;Its analogy to your own &s;tate con|&s;titution</HI>&mdash;and la&s;tly, <HI>the additional &s;ecurity, which its adoption will afford to the pre&s;ervation of that &s;pecies of government, to liberty and to property.</HI></P>
<P>In the progre&s;s of this di&s;cu&s;&s;ion I &s;hall endeavour to give a &s;atisfactory an&s;wer to all the objections which &s;hall have made their appearance, that may &s;eem to have any claim to your attention.</P>
<P>It may perhaps be thought &s;uperfluous to offer ar|guments to prove the utility of the UNION, a point, no doubt, deeply engraved on the hearts of the great body of the people in every State, and one, which it may be imagined has no adver&s;aries. But the fact is, that we already hear it whi&s;pered in the private circles of tho&s;e who oppo&s;e the new con&s;titution, that the Thirteen States are of too great extent for any general &s;y&s;tem, and that we mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity re&s;ort to &s;eparate confederacies of di&s;tinct portions of the whole.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The &s;ame idea, tracing the arguments to their con&s;equences, is held out in &s;everal of the late publications again&s;t the new con&s;titution.</NOTE> This doctrine will, in all probability, be
<PB N="6" REF="021127_0011_0FB23B824F5A2148">
gradually propagated, till it has votaries enough to countenance an open avowal of it. For nothing can be more evident, to tho&s;e who are able to take an enlarged view of the &s;ubject, than the alternative of an adoption of the new con&s;titution, or a di&s;mem|berment of the Union. It will therefore be of u&s;e to beg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n by examining the advantages of that Union, the certain evils and the probable dangers, to which every &s;tate will be expo&s;ed from its di&s;&s;olution.&mdash; This &s;hall accordingly con&s;titute the &s;ubject of my next addre&s;s.</P>

<HEAD>NUMBER II. Concerning Dangers from foreign Force and Influence.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN the people of America reflect that they are now called upon to decide a que&s;tion, which, in its con&s;equences, mu&s;t prove one of the mo&s;t important, that ever engaged their attention, the pro|priety of their taking a very comprehen&s;ive, as well as a very &s;erious view of it, will be evident.</P>
<P>Nothing is more certain than the indi&s;pen&s;able ne|ce&s;&s;ity of government; and it is equally undeniable, that whenever and however it is in&s;tituted, the people mu&s;t cede to it &s;ome of their natural rights, in order to ve&s;t it with requi&s;ite powers. It is well worthy of con&s;ideration therefore, whether it would conduce more to the intere&s;t of the people of America, that they &s;hould, to all general purpo&s;es, be one nation, under one federal government, than that they &s;hould divide them&s;elves into &s;eparate confederacies, and give to the head of each, the &s;ame kind of powers which they are advi&s;ed to place in one national government.</P>
<P>It has until lately been a received and uncontra|dicted opinion, that the pro&s;perity of the people of
<PB N="7" REF="021127_0012_0FB23B83454522E8">
America depended on their continuing firmly united, and the wi&s;hes, prayers and efforts of our be&s;t and wi&s;e&s;t citizens have been con&s;tantly directed to that object. But politicians now appear, who in&s;i&s;t that this opinion is erroneous, and that in&s;tead of looking for &s;afety and happine&s;s in union, we ought to &s;eek it in a divi&s;ion of the &s;tates into di&s;tinct confederacies or &s;overeignties. However extraordinary this new doctrine may appear, it neverthele&s;s has its advocates; and certain characters who were much oppo&s;ed to it formerly, are at pre&s;ent of the number. Whatever may be the arguments or inducements, which have wrought this change in the &s;entiments and declarat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ons of the&s;e gent<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">emen, it certainly would not be wi&s;e in the people at large to adopt the&s;e new political tenets without being fully convinced that they are founded in truth and &s;ound Policy.</P>
<P>It has often given me plea&s;ure to ob&s;erve, that in|dependent America was not compo&s;ed of detached and di&s;tant territories, but that one connected, fertile, wide &s;preading country, was the portion of our we&s;tern &s;ons of liberty. Providence has in a particular manner ble&s;&s;ed it with a variety of &s;oils and productions, and watered it with innumerable &s;treams, for the delight and accommodation of its inhabitants. A &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of navigable waters forms a kind of chain round its borders, as if to bind it together; while the mo&s;t noble rivers in the world, running at convenient di&s;tances, pre&s;ent them with highways for the ea&s;y communi|cation of friendly aids, and the mutual tran&s;portation and exchange of their various commodities.</P>
<P>With equal plea&s;ure I have as often taken notice, that Providence has been plea&s;ed to give this one connected country, to one united people, a people de&s;cended from the &s;ame ance&s;tors, &s;peaking the &s;ame language, profe&s;&s;ing the &s;ame religion, attached to the &s;ame principles of government, very &s;imilar in their manners and cu&s;toms, and who, by their joint coun&s;els, arms and efforts, fighting &s;ide by &s;ide
<PB N="8" REF="021127_0013_0FB23B84C7A71B40">
throughout a long and bloody war, have nobly e&s;tab|li&s;hed their general liberty and independence.</P>
<P>This country and this people &s;eem to have been made for each other, and it appears as if it was the de&s;ign of Providence, that an inheritance &s;o proper and convenient for a band of brethren, united to each other by the &s;tronge&s;t ties, &s;hould never be &s;plit into a number of un&s;ocial, jealous and alien &s;ove|reignties.</P>
<P>Similar &s;entiments have hitherto prevailed among all orders and denominations of men among us. To all general purpo&s;es we have uniformly been one people&mdash;each individual citizen every where enjoying the &s;ame national rights, privileges, and protection. As a nation we have made peace and war&mdash;as a nation we have vanqui&s;hed our common enemies&mdash;as a nation we have formed alliances and made treaties, and entered into various compacts and conventions with foreign &s;tates.</P>
<P>A &s;trong &s;en&s;e of the value and ble&s;&s;ings of Union induced the people, at a very early period, to in|&s;titute a federal government to pre&s;erve and perpe|tuate it. They formed it almo&s;t as &s;oon as they had a political exi&s;tence; nay at a time, when their habitations were in flames, when many of their citizens were bleeding, and when the progre&s;s of ho&s;tility and de&s;olation left little room for tho&s;e calm and mature enquiries and reflections, which mu&s;t ever precede the formation of a wi&s;e and well balanced government for a free people. It is not to be won|dered at that a government in&s;tituted in times &s;o inau&s;picious, &s;hould on experiment be found greatly deficient and inadequate to the purpo&s;e it was in|tended to an&s;wer.</P>
<P>This intelligent people perceived and regretted the&s;e defects. Still continuing no le&s;s attached to union, than enamoured of liberty, they ob&s;erved the danger, which immediately threatned the former and more remotely the latter; and being per&s;uaded that
<PB N="9" REF="021127_0014_0FB23B86479EC288">
ample &s;ecurity for both, could only be found in a national government more wi&s;ely framed, they, as with one voice, convened the late Convention at Philadelphia, to take that important &s;ubject under con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>This Convention, compo&s;ed of men who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the confidence of the people, and many of whom had become highly di&s;tingui&s;hed by their patrioti&s;m, virtue and wi&s;dom, in times which tried the minds and hearts of men, undertook the arduous ta&s;k. In the mild &s;ea&s;on of peace, with minds unoccupied by other &s;ubjects, they pa&s;&s;ed many months in cool uninter|rupted and daily con&s;ultations: And finally, without having been awed by power, or influenced by any pa&s;&s;ions, except love for their country, they pre&s;ented and recommended to the people the plan produced by their joint and very unanimous coun&s;els.</P>
<P>Admit, for &s;o is the fact, that this plan is only <HI>recommended,</HI> not impo&s;ed, yet let it be remembered, that it is neither recommended to <HI>blind</HI> approbation, nor to <HI>blind</HI> reprobation; but to that &s;edate and candid con&s;ideration, which the magnitude and impor|tance of the &s;ubject demand, and wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ch it certainly ought to receive. But, as has been already remarked, it is more to be wi&s;hed than expected that it may be &s;o con&s;idered and examined. Experience on a former occa&s;ion teaches us not to be too &s;anguine in &s;uch hopes. It is not yet forgotten, that well grounded apprehen&s;ions of imminent danger induced the people of America to form the memorable Congre&s;s of 1774. That body recommended certain mea&s;ures to their con&s;tituents, and the event proved their wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">dom; yet it is fre&s;h in our memories how &s;oon the pre&s;s began to teem with pamphlets and weekly papers again&s;t tho&s;e very mea&s;ures.

not corre&s;pond with the public good, were indefa|tigable in their endeavours to per&s;uade the people to reject the advice of that patriotic Congre&s;s. Many indeed were deceived and deluded, but the great ma|jority of the people rea&s;oned and decided judiciou&s;ly; and happy they are in reflecting that they did &s;o.</P>
<P>They con&s;idered that the Congre&s;s was compo&s;ed of many wi&s;e and experienced men. That being con|vened from different parts of the country, they brought with them and communicated to each other a variety of u&s;eful information. That in the cour&s;e of the time they pa&s;&s;ed together in enquiring into and di&s;cu&s;&s;ing the true intere&s;ts of their country, they mu&s;t have acquired very accurate knowledge on that head. That they were individually intere&s;ted in the public liberty and pro&s;perity, and therefore that it was not le&s;s their inclination, than their duty, to recommend only &s;uch mea&s;ures, as after the mo&s;t mature delibe|ration they realy thought prudent and advi&s;able.</P>
<P>The&s;e and &s;imilar con&s;iderations then induced the people to rely greatly on the judgment and integrity of the Congre&s;s; and they took their advice, notwith|&s;tanding the various arts and endeavours u&s;ed to deter and di&s;&s;uade them from it. But if the people at large had rea&s;on to confide in the men of that Congre&s;s, few of whom had then been fully tried or generally known, &s;till greater rea&s;on have they now to re&s;pect the judg|ment and advice of the Convention, for it is well known that &s;ome of the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed members of that Congre&s;s, who have been &s;ince tried and ju&s;tly approved for patrioti&s;m and abilities, and who have grown old in acquiring political information, were al&s;o members of this Convention, and carried into it their accumulated knowledge and experience.</P>
<P>It is worthy of remark that not only the fir&s;t, but every &s;ucceeding Congre&s;s, as well as the late Con|vention, have invariably joined with the people in thinking that the pro&s;perity of America depended on its Union. To pre&s;erve and perpetuate it, was the
<PB N="11" REF="021127_0016_0FB23B89456FEC08">
great object of the people in forming that Conven|tion, and it is al&s;o the great object of the plan which the Convention has advi&s;ed them to adopt. With what propriety therefore, or for what good purpo&s;es, are attempts at this particular period, made by &s;ome men, to depreciate the importance of the Union? or why is it &s;ugge&s;ted that three or four confederacies would be better than one? I am per&s;uaded in my own mind, that the people have always thought right on this &s;ubject, and that their univer&s;al and uniform at|tachment to the cau&s;e of the Union, re&s;ts on great and weighty rea&s;ons, which I &s;hall endeavour to develope and explain in &s;ome en&s;uing papers.

<P>IT is not a new ob&s;ervation that the people of any country (if like the Americans intelligent and well informed) &s;eldom adopt, and &s;teadily per&s;evere for many years, in an eroneous opinion re&s;pecting their intere&s;ts. That con&s;ideration naturally tends to create great re&s;pect for the high opinion which the people of America have &s;o long and uniformly entertained of the importance of their continuing firmly united under
<PB N="12" REF="021127_0017_0FB23B8AC5B7E1E8">
one federal government, ve&s;ted with &s;ufficient powers for all general and national purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>The more attentively I con&s;ider and inve&s;tigate the rea&s;ons which appear to have given birth to this opinion, the more I become convinced that they are cogent and conclu&s;ive.</P>
<P>Among the many objects to which a wi&s;e and free people find it nece&s;&s;ary to direct their attention, that of providing for their <HI>&s;afety</HI> &s;eems to be the fir&s;t. The <HI>&s;afety</HI> of the people doubtle&s;s has relation to a great variety of circum&s;tances and con&s;iderations, and con&s;equently affords great latitude to tho&s;e who wi&s;h to define it preci&s;ely and comprehen&s;ively.</P>
<P>At pre&s;ent I mean only to con&s;ider it as it re&s;pects &s;ecurity for the pre&s;ervation of peace and tranquility, as well again&s;t dangers, from <HI>foreign arms and influence,</HI> as from dangers of the <HI>like kind</HI> ari&s;ing from dome&s;tic cau&s;es. As the former of the&s;e comes fir&s;t in order, it is proper it &s;hould be the fir&s;t di&s;cu&s;&s;ed. Let us therefore proceed to examine whether the people are not right in their opinion, that a cordial Union under an efficient national Government, affords them the be&s;t &s;ecurity that can be devi&s;ed again&s;t <HI>ho&s;tilities</HI> from abroad.</P>
<P>The number of wars which have happened or will happen in the world, will always be found to be in proportion to the number and weight of the cau&s;es, whether <HI>real</HI> or <HI>pretended,</HI> which <HI>provoke</HI> or <HI>invite</HI> them. If this remark be ju&s;t, it becomes u&s;eful to inquire, whether &s;o many <HI>ju&s;t</HI> cau&s;es of war are likely to be given by <HI>united</HI> America, as by <HI>di&s;united</HI> Ame|rica; for if it &s;hould turn out that united America will probably give the fewe&s;t, then it will follow that, in this re&s;pect, the Union tends mo&s;t to pre&s;erve the people in a &s;tate of peace with other nations.</P>
<P>The <HI>ju&s;t</HI> cau&s;es of war for the mo&s;t part ari&s;e either from violations of treaties, or from direct violence. America has already formed treaties with no le&s;s than &s;ix foreign nations, and all of them, except Pru&s;&s;ia,
<PB N="13" REF="021127_0018_0FB23B8C45E8D140">
are maritime, and therefore able to annoy and injure us: She has al&s;o exten&s;ive commerce with Portugal, Spain, and Britain, and with re&s;pect to the two latter, has in addition the circum&s;tance of neighbourhood to attend to.</P>
<P>It is of high importance to the peace of America, that &s;he ob&s;erve the laws of nations towards all the&s;e powers, and to me it appears evident that this will be more perfectly and punctually done by one national government than it could be either by thirteen &s;epa|rate &s;tates, or by three or four di&s;tinct confederacies. For this opinion various rea&s;ons may be a&s;&s;igned.</P>
<P>When once an efficient national government is e&s;ta|bli&s;hed, the be&s;t men in the country will not only con&s;ent to &s;erve, but al&s;o will generally be appointed to manage it; for although town or county, or other contracted influence may place men in &s;tate a&s;&s;em|blies, or &s;enates, or courts of ju&s;tice, or executive de|partments; yet more general and exten&s;ive reputation for talents and other qualifications, will be nece&s;&s;ary to recommend men to offices under the national go|vernment, e&s;pecially as it will have the wide&s;t field for choice, and never experience that want of proper per&s;ons, which is not uncommon in &s;ome of the &s;tates. Hence it will re&s;ult, that the admini&s;tration, the poli|tical coun&s;els, and the judicial deci&s;ions of the national government will be more wi&s;e, &s;y&s;tematical and judi|cious, than tho&s;e of individual &s;tates, and con&s;equently more &s;atisfactory with re&s;pect to other nations, as well as more <HI>&s;afe</HI> with re&s;pect to us.</P>
<P>Under the national government, treaties and ar|ticles of treaties, as well as the laws of nations, will always be expounded in one &s;en&s;e, and executed in the &s;ame manner&mdash;whereas adjudications on the &s;ame points and que&s;tions, in thirteen &s;tates, or in three or four confederacies, will not always accord or be con|&s;i&s;tent; and that as well from the variety of inde|pendent courts and judges appointed by different and independent governments, as from the different local
<PB N="14" REF="021127_0019_0FB23B8DC531BA28">
laws and intere&s;ts which may affect and influence them. The wi&s;dom of the Convention in commiting &s;uch que&s;tions to the juri&s;diction and judgment of courts appointed by, and re&s;pon&s;ible only to one national government, cannot be too much commended.</P>
<P>The pro&s;pect of pre&s;ent lo&s;s or advantage, may often tempt the governing party in one or two &s;tates to &s;werve from good faith and ju&s;tice; but tho&s;e temptations not reaching the other &s;tates, and con|&s;equently having little or no influence on the national government, the temptations will be fruitle&s;s, and good faith and ju&s;tice be pre&s;erved. The ca&s;e of the treaty of peace with Britain, adds great weight to this rea&s;oning.</P>
<P>If even the governing party in a &s;tate &s;hould be di&s;po&s;ed to re&s;i&s;t &s;uch temptations, yet as &s;uch temp|tations may, and commonly do re&s;ult from circum|&s;tances peculiar to the &s;tate, and may affect a great number of the inhabitans, the governing party may not always be able if willing to prevent the inju&s;tice meditated, or to puni&s;h the agre&s;&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rs. But the na|tional government, not being affected by tho&s;e local circum&s;tances, will neither be induced to commit the wrong them&s;elves, nor want power or inclination to prevent, or puni&s;h its commi&s;&s;ion by others.</P>
<P>So far therefore as either de&s;igned or accidental violations of treaties and of the laws of nations afford <HI>ju&s;t</HI> cau&s;es of war, they are le&s;s to be apprehended under one general government, than under &s;everal le&s;&s;er ones, and in that re&s;pect, the former mo&s;t favors the <HI>&s;afety</HI> of the people.</P>
<P>As to tho&s;e ju&s;t cau&s;es of war which proceed from direct and unlawful violence, it appears equally clear to me, that one good national government affords va&s;tly more &s;ecurity again&s;t dangers of that &s;ort, than can be derived from any other quarter.&mdash;</P>
<P>Such violencies are more frequently occa&s;ioned by the pa&s;&s;ions and intere&s;ts of a part than of the whole, of one or two &s;tates than of the union.&mdash;

Not a &s;ingle Indian war has yet been produced by aggre&s;&s;ions of the pre&s;ent federal government, feeble as it is, but there are &s;everal in&s;tances of Indian ho&s;ti|lities having been provoked by the improper conduct of individual &s;tates, who either unable or unwilling to re&s;train or puni&s;h offences, have given occa&s;ion to the &s;laugh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">er of many innocent inhabitants.&mdash;</P>
<P>The neighbourhood of Spani&s;h and Briti&s;h terri|tories, bordering on &s;ome &s;tates, and not on others, naturally confines the cau&s;es of quarrel more immedi|ately to the borderers. The bordering &s;tates, if any, will be tho&s;e who, under the impul&s;e of &s;udden irri|tation, and a quick &s;en&s;e of apparent intere&s;t or injury, will be mo&s;t likely by direct violence, to excite war with tho&s;e nations; and nothing can &s;o effectually obviate that danger, as a national government, who&s;e wi&s;dom and prudence will not be dimini&s;hed by the pa&s;&s;ions which actuate the parties immediately intere&s;ted.</P>
<P>But not only fewer ju&s;t cau&s;es of war will be given by the national government, but it will al&s;o be more in their power to accommodate and &s;ettle them ami|cably. They will be more temperate and cool, and in that re&s;pect, as well as in others, will be more in capacity to act with circum&s;pection than the offending &s;tate. The pride of &s;tates as well as of men, na|turally di&s;po&s;es them to ju&s;tify all their actions, and oppo&s;es their acknowleging, correcting or repairing their errors and offences. The national government in &s;uch ca&s;es will not be affected by this pride, but will proceed with moderation and candour to con&s;ider and decide on the means mo&s;t proper to extricate them from the difficulties which threaten them.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides it is well known that acknowledgments, explanations and compen&s;ations are often accepted as &s;atisfactory from a &s;trong united nation, which would be rejected as un&s;atisfactory if offered by a &s;tate or confederacy of little con&s;ideration or power.</P>

<P>MY la&s;t paper a&s;&s;igned &s;everal rea&s;ons why the &s;afety of the people would be be&s;t &s;ecured by Union again&s;t the danger it may be expo&s;ed to by <HI>ju&s;t</HI> cau&s;es of war given to other nations; and tho&s;e rea&s;ons &s;hew that &s;uch cau&s;es would not only be more rarely given, but would al&s;o be more ea&s;ily accom|modated by a national government, than either by the &s;tate governments, or the propo&s;ed confederacies.</P>
<P>But the &s;afety of the people of America again&s;t dangers from <HI>foreign</HI> force, depends not only on their forbearing to give <HI>ju&s;t</HI> cau&s;es of war to other nations, but al&s;o on their placing and continuing them&s;elves in &s;uch a &s;ituation as not to <HI>invite</HI> ho&s;tility or in&s;ult; for it need not be ob&s;erved, that there are <HI>pretended</HI> as well as ju&s;t cau&s;es of war.</P>
<P>It is too true, however di&s;graceful it may be to human nature, that nations in general will make war whenever they have a pro&s;pect of getting any thing by it, nay that ab&s;olute monarchs will often make war when their nations are to get nothing by it, but for purpo&s;es and objects merely per&s;onal, &s;uch as, a thir&s;t for military glory, revenge for per&s;onal affronts, ambition or private compacts to aggrandize or &s;up|port their particular families, or partizans. The&s;e
<PB N="17" REF="021127_0022_0FB23B92CD5CBEF0">
and a variety of motives, which affect only the mind of the &s;overeign, often lead him to engage in wars not &s;anctified by ju&s;tice, or the voice and intere&s;ts of his people. But independent of the&s;e inducements to war, which are mo&s;t prevalent in ab&s;olute monarchies, but which well de&s;erve our attention, there are others which affect nations as often as kings; and &s;ome of them will on examination be found to grow out of our relative &s;ituation and circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>With France and with Britain we are rivals in the fi&s;heries, and can &s;upply their markets cheaper than they can them&s;elves, notwith&s;tanding any efforts to prevent it by bounties on their own, or duties on foreign fi&s;h.</P>
<P>With them and mo&s;t other European nations, we are rivals in navigation and the carrying trade; and we &s;hall deceive our&s;elves if we &s;uppo&s;e that any of them will rejoice to &s;ee it flouri&s;h: for as our carrying trade cannot increa&s;e, without in &s;ome degree dimi|ni&s;hing their's, it is more their intere&s;t and will be more their policy, to re&s;train, than to promote it.</P>
<P>In the trade to China and India, we interfere with more than one nation, ina&s;much as it enables us to partake in advantages which they had in a manner monopolized, and as we thereby &s;upply our&s;elves with commodities which we u&s;ed to purcha&s;e from them.</P>
<P>The exten&s;ion of our own commerce in our own ve&s;&s;els, cannot give plea&s;ure to any nations who po&s;|&s;e&s;s territories on or near this continent, becau&s;e the cheapne&s;s and excellence of our productions, added to the circum&s;tance of vicinity, and the enterprize and addre&s;s of our merchants and navigators, will give us a greater &s;hare in the advantages which tho&s;e territories afford, than con&s;i&s;ts with the wi&s;hes or policy of their re&s;pective &s;overeigns.</P>
<P>Spain thinks it convenient to &s;hut the Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi again&s;t us on the one &s;ide, and Britain excludes us from the St. Lawrence on the other; nor will either of them permit the other waters, which are between
<PB N="18" REF="021127_0023_0FB23B93C521E760">
them and us, to become the means of mutual inter|cour&s;e and traffic.</P>
<P>From the&s;e and &s;uch like con&s;iderations, which might if con&s;i&s;tent with prudence, be more amplified and detailed, it is ea&s;y to &s;ee that jealou&s;ies and un|ea&s;ine&s;&s;es may gradually &s;lide into the minds and cabinets of other nations; and that we are not to expect they &s;hould regard our advancement in union, in power and con&s;equence by land and by &s;ea, with an eye of indifference and compo&s;ure.</P>
<P>The people of America are aware that inducements to war may ari&s;e out of the&s;e circum&s;tances, as well as from others not &s;o obvious at pre&s;ent; and that when|ever &s;uch inducements may find fit time and oppor|tunity for operation, pretences to colour and ju&s;tify them will not be wanting. Wi&s;ely therefore do they con&s;ider union and a good national government as nece&s;&s;ary to put and keep them in <HI>&s;uch a &s;ituation</HI> as in&s;tead of <HI>inviting</HI> war, will tend to repre&s;s and di&s;courage it. That &s;ituation con&s;i&s;ts in the be&s;t po&s;&s;ible &s;tate of defence, and nece&s;&s;arily depends on the government, the arms and the re&s;ources of the country.</P>
<P>As the &s;afety of the whole is the intere&s;t of the whole, and cannot be provided for without govern|ment, either one or more or many, let us inquire whether one good government is not, relative to the object in que&s;tion, more competent than any other given number whatever.</P>
<P>One government can collect and avail it&s;elf of the talents and experience of the able&s;t men, in whatever part of the union they may be found. It can move on uniform principles of policy. It can harmonize, a&s;&s;imilate, and protect the &s;everal parts and members, and extend the benefit of its fore&s;ight and precautions to each. In the formation of treaties it will regard the intere&s;t of the whole, and the particular intere&s;ts of the parts as connected with that of the whole. It can apply the re&s;ources and power of the whole to the
<PB N="19" REF="021127_0024_0FB23B954572DA08">
defence of any particular part, and that more ea&s;ily and expeditiou&s;ly than &s;tate governments, or &s;eparate confederacies can po&s;&s;ibly do, for want of concert and unity of &s;y&s;tem. It can place the militia under one plan of di&s;cipline, and by putting their officers in a proper line of &s;ubordination to the chief magi&s;trate, will in a manner con&s;olidate them into one corps, and thereby render them more efficient than if divided into thirteen or into three or four di&s;tinct indepen|dent bodies.</P>
<P>What would the militia of Britain be, if the Engli&s;h militia obeyed the government of England, if the Scotch militia obeyed the government of Scotland, and if the Welch militia obeyed the government of Wales! Suppo&s;e an inva&s;ion, would tho&s;e three go|vernments (if they agreed at all) be able with all their re&s;pective forces, to operate again&s;t the enemy &s;o effectually as the &s;ingle government of Great Britain would?</P>
<P>We have heard much of the fleets of Britain, and the time may come, if we are wi&s;e, when the fleets of America may engage attention. But if one national government had not &s;o regulated the navigation of Britain as to make it a nur&s;ery for &s;eamen&mdash;if one national government had not called forth all the na|tional means and materials for forming fleets, their prowe&s;s and their thunder would never have been cele|brated. Let England have its navigation and fleet&mdash; let Scotland have its navigation and fleet&mdash;let Wales have its navigation and fleet&mdash;let Ireland have its navigation and fleet&mdash;let tho&s;e four of the con&s;tituent parts of the Briti&s;h empire be under four independent governments, and it is ea&s;y to perceive how &s;oon they would each dwindle into comparitive in&s;ignificance.</P>
<P>Apply the&s;e facts to our own ca&s;e. Leave America divided into thirteen, or if you plea&s;e into three or four independent governments, what armies could they rai&s;e and pay, what fleets could they ever hope to have? If one was attacked would the other fly to its &s;uccour, and
<PB N="20" REF="021127_0025_0FB23B96C4C8EA20">
&s;pend their blood and money in its defence? would there be no danger of their being flattered into neutrality by &s;pecious promi&s;es, or &s;educed by a too great fond|ne&s;s for peace to decline hazarding their tranquility and pre&s;ent &s;afety for the &s;ake of neighbours, of whom perhaps they have been jealous, and who&s;e importance they are content to &s;ee dimini&s;hed? Although &s;uch conduct would not be wi&s;e it would neverthele&s;s be natural. The hi&s;tory of the &s;tates of Greece, and of other countries abound with &s;uch in&s;tances, and it is not improbable that what has &s;o often happened, would under &s;imilar circum&s;tances happen again.</P>
<P>But admit that they might be willing to help the invaded &s;tate or confederacy. How and when, and in what proportion &s;hall aids of men and money be afforded? who &s;hall command the allied armies, and from which of them &s;hall he receive his orders? Who &s;hall &s;ettle the terms of peace, and in ca&s;e of di&s;putes what umpire &s;hall decide between them, and compel acquie&s;cence? Various difficulties and inconveniences would be in&s;eparable from &s;uch a &s;ituation; whereas one government watching over the general and com|mon intere&s;ts, and combining and directing the powers and re&s;ources of the whole, would be free from all the&s;e embarra&s;&s;ments and conduce far more to the &s;afety of the people.</P>
<P>But whatever may be our &s;ituation, whether firmly united under one national government, or &s;plit into a number of confederacies, certain it is, that foreign nations will know and view it exactly as it is; and they will act towards us accordingly If they &s;ee that our national government is efficient and well admini&s;tred&mdash;our trade prudently regulated&mdash;our mi|litia properly organized and di&s;ciplined&mdash;our re&s;ources and finances di&s;creetly managed&mdash;our credit re-e&s;ta|bli&s;hed&mdash;our people free, contented, and united, they will be much more di&s;po&s;ed to cultivate our friend&s;hip, than provoke our re&s;en<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ment.

How liable would &s;he become not only to their contempt, but to their outrage; and how &s;oon would dear bought experience proclaim, that when a people or family &s;o divide, it never fails to be again&s;t them&s;elves.</P>

<P>It was remarked in the preceding paper, that weak|ne&s;s and divi&s;ions at home, would invite dangers from abroad, and that nothing would tend more to &s;ecure us from them than union, &s;trength, and good govern|ment within our&s;elves. This &s;ubject is copious and cannot ea&s;ily be exhau&s;ted.</P>
<P>The hi&s;tory of Great-Britain is the one with which we are in general the be&s;t acquainted, and it gives us many u&s;eful le&s;&s;ons. We may profit by their ex|perience, without paying the price which it co&s;t them. Although it &s;eems obvious to common &s;en&s;e, that the people of &s;uch an i&s;land &s;hould be but one nation, yet we find that they were for ages divided into three, and tho&s;e three were almo&s;t con&s;tantly embroiled in quarrels and wars with one another. Notwith&s;tand|ing their true intere&s;t, with re&s;pect to the continental nations, was really the &s;ame, yet by the arts and policy and practices of tho&s;e nations, their mutual jealou&s;ies were perpetually kept enflamed, and for a long &s;eries of years they were far more inconvenient and trouble&s;ome, than they were u&s;eful and a&s;&s;i&s;ting to each other.</P>
<P>Should the people of America divide them&s;elves into three or four nations, would not the &s;ame thing happen? Would not &s;imilar jealou&s;ies ari&s;e; and be in like manner cheri&s;hed? In&s;tead of their being
<Q>joined in affection and free from all apprehen&s;ion of different intere&s;ts,</Q>
envy and jealou&s;y would &s;oon extingui&s;h confidence and affection, and the partial intere&s;ts of each confederacy in&s;tead of the general intere&s;ts of all America, would be the only objects of their policy and pur&s;uits. Hence like mo&s;t other <HI>bordering</HI> nations, they would always be either involved in di&s;putes and war, or live in the con&s;tant apprehen&s;ion of them.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t &s;anguine advocates for three or four con|federacies, cannot rea&s;onably &s;uppo&s;e that they would

long remain exactly on an equal footing in point of &s;trength, even if it was po&s;&s;ible to form them &s;o at fir&s;t&mdash;but admitting that to be practicable, yet what human contrivance can &s;ecure the continuance of &s;uch equality? Independent of tho&s;e local circum&s;tances which tend to beget and encrea&s;e power in one part, and to impede its progre&s;s in another, we mu&s;t advert to the effects of that &s;uperior policy and good manage|ment which would probably di&s;tingui&s;h the govern|ment of one above the re&s;t, and by which their rela|tive equality in &s;trength and con&s;ideration, would be de&s;troyed.

<P>Whenever, and from whatever cau&s;es, it might happen; and happen it would, that any one of the&s;e nations or confederacies &s;hould ri&s;e on the &s;cale of po|litical importance much above the degree of their neighbours, that moment would tho&s;e neighbours be|hold her with envy and with fear: Both tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ions would lead them to countenance, if not to promote, whatever might promi&s;e to dimini&s;h her importance; and would al&s;o re&s;train them from mea&s;ures calculated to advance, or even to &s;ecure her pro&s;perity. Much time would not be nece&s;&s;ary to enable her to di&s;cern the&s;e unfriendly di&s;po&s;itions. She would &s;oon begin, not only to lo&s;e confidence in her neighbours, but al&s;o to feel a di&s;po&s;ition equally unfavorable to them: Di&s;tru&s;t naturally creates di&s;tru&s;t, and by nothing is good will and kind conduct more &s;peedily changed, than by invidious jealou&s;ies and uncandid imputations, whether expre&s;&s;ed or implied.</P>
<P>The North is generally the region of &s;trength, and many local circum&s;tances render it probable, that the mo&s;t Nor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hern of the propo&s;ed confederacies would, at a period not very di&s;tant, be unque&s;tionably more for|midable than any of the others.

<P>They who well con&s;ider the hi&s;tory of &s;imilar di|vi&s;ions and confederacies, will find abundant rea&s;on to apprehend, that tho&s;e in contemplation would in no other &s;en&s;e be neighbours, than as they would be borderers; that they would neither love nor tru&s;t one another, but on the contrary would be a prey to di&s;|cord, jealou&s;y and mutual injuries; in &s;hort that they would place us exactly in the &s;ituation in which &s;ome nations doubtle&s;s wi&s;h to &s;ee us, viz. <HI>formidable only to each other.</HI></P>

<P>Nay it is far more probable that in America, as in Europe, neighbouring nations, acting under the impul&s;e of oppo&s;ite intere&s;ts, and unfriendly pa&s;&s;ions, would frequently be found taking different &s;ides. Con|&s;idering our di&s;tance from Europe, it would be more natural for the&s;e confederacies to apprehend danger from one another, than from di&s;tant nations, and therefore that each of them &s;hould be more de&s;irous to guard again&s;t the others, by the aid of foreign alliances, than to guard again&s;t foreign dangers by alliances between them&s;elves. And here let us not forget how much more ea&s;y it is to receive foreign fleets into our ports, and foreign armies into our country, than it is to per&s;uade or compel them to depart.

<HEAD>NUMBER VI. Concerning Dangers from War between the States.</HEAD>
<P>THE three la&s;t numbers of this paper have been dedicated to an enumeration of the dangers to which we &s;hould be expo&s;ed, in a &s;tate of di&s;union, from the arms and arts of foreign nations. I &s;hall now proceed to delineate dangers of a different, and,

perhaps, &s;till more alarming kind, tho&s;e which will in all probability flow from di&s;&s;entions between the &s;tates them&s;elves, and from dome&s;tic factions and con|vul&s;ions. The&s;e have been already in &s;ome in&s;tances &s;lightly anticipated; but they de&s;erve a more parti|cular and more full inve&s;tigation.</P>
<P>A man mu&s;t be far gone in Utopian &s;peculations who can &s;eriou&s;ly doubt, that if the&s;e &s;tates &s;hould either be wholly di&s;united, or only united in partial confederacies, the &s;ubdivi&s;ions into which they might be thrown would have frequent and violent conte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ts with each other. To pre&s;ume a want of motives for &s;uch conte&s;ts, as an argument again&s;t their exi&s;tence, would be to forget that men are ambitious, vindictive and rapacious. To look for a continuation of harmony between a number of independent unconnected &s;ove|reignties, &s;ituated in the &s;ame neighbourhood, would be to di&s;regard the uniform cour&s;e of human events, and to &s;et at defiance the accumulated experience of ages.</P>
<P>The cau&s;es of ho&s;tility among nations are innu|merable. There are &s;ome which have a general and almo&s;t con&s;tant operation upon the collective bodies of &s;ociety: Of this de&s;cription are the love of power, or the de&s;ire of pre-eminence and dominion&mdash;the jea|lou&s;y of power, or the de&s;ire of equality and &s;afety. There are others which have a more circum&s;cribed, though an equally operative influence, within their &s;pheres: Such are the rival&s;hips and competitions of commerce between commercial nations. And there are others, not le&s;s numerous than either of the for|mer, which take their origin entirely in private pa&s;|&s;ions; in the attachments, enmities, intere&s;ts, hopes and fears of leading individuals in the communities of which they are members. Men of this cla&s;s, whether the favourites of a king or of a people, have in too many in&s;tances abu&s;ed the confidence they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed; and a&s;&s;uming the pretext of &s;ome public motive, have not &s;crupled to &s;acrifice the national tranquility to per|&s;onal advantage, or per&s;onal gratification.</P>

<HEAD>NUMBER VII. The Subject continued and particular Cau&s;es enumerated.</HEAD>
<P>IT is &s;ometimes a&s;ked, with an air of &s;eeming tri|umph, what inducements could the &s;tates have, if di&s;united, to make war upon each other? It would be a full an&s;wer to this que&s;tion to &s;ay&mdash;preci&s;ely the &s;ame inducements which have, at different times, de|luged in blood all the nations in the world. But un|fortunately for us, the que&s;tion admits of a more par|ticular an&s;wer. There are cau&s;es of difference within our immediate contemplation, of the tendency of which, even under the re&s;traints of a federal con&s;titu|tion, we have had &s;ufficient experience to enable us to form a judgment of what might be expected, if tho&s;e re&s;traints were removed.</P>
<P>Territorial di&s;putes have at all times been found one of the mo&s;t fertile &s;ources of ho&s;tility among nations. Perhaps the greate&s;t proportion of the wars that have de&s;olated the earth have &s;prung from this origin.&mdash; This cau&s;e would exi&s;t, among us, in full force. We have a va&s;t tract of un&s;ettled territory within the boun|daries of the United States. There &s;till are di&s;cor|dant and undecided claims between &s;everal of them; and the di&s;&s;olution of the union would lay a founda|tion for &s;imilar claims between them all. It is well known, that they have heretofore had &s;erious and ani|mated di&s;cu&s;&s;ions concerning the right to the lands which were ungranted at the time of the revolution, and which u&s;ually went under the name of crown|lands. The &s;tates within the limits of who&s;e colonial governments they were compri&s;ed, have claimed them as their property; the others have contended that the rights of the crown in this article devolved upon the union; e&s;pecially as to all that part of the We&s;tern territory which, either by actual po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, or through the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of the Indian proprietors, was &s;ubjected
<PB N="34" REF="021127_0039_0FB23BABC60438E0">
to the juri&s;diction of the King of Great-Britain, till it was relinqui&s;hed in the treaty of peace. This, it has been &s;aid, was at all events an acqui&s;ition to the confederacy by compact with a foreign power. It has been the prudent policy of Congre&s;s to appea&s;e this controver&s;y, by prevailing upon the &s;tates to make ce&s;&s;ions to the United States for the benefit of the whole. This has been &s;o far accompli&s;hed, as under a continuation of the union, to afford a decided pro&s;pect of an amicable termination of the di&s;pute. A di&s;|memberment of the confederacy however would revive this di&s;pute, and would create others on the &s;ame &s;ub|ject. At pre&s;ent, a large part of the vacant We&s;tern territory is by ce&s;&s;ion at lea&s;t, if not by any anterior right, the common property of the un<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">on. If that were at an end, the &s;tates which have made ce&s;&s;ions, on a principle of federal compromi&s;e, would be apt, when the motive of the grant had cea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed, to reclaim the lands as a rever&s;ion. The<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;tates would no doubt in&s;i&s;t on a proportion, by right of repre&s;entation. Their argument would be that a grant, once made, could not be revoked; and that the ju&s;tice of their participating in territory acquired, or &s;ecured by the joint efforts of the confederacy, remained undimi|ni&s;hed. If contrary to probability it &s;hould be admit|ted by all the &s;tates, that each had a right to a &s;hare of this common &s;tock, there would &s;till be a difficulty to be &s;urmounted, as to a proper rule of apportion|ment. Different principles would be &s;et up by different &s;tates for this purpo&s;e; and as they would affect the oppo&s;ite intere&s;ts of the parties, they might not ea&s;ily be &s;u&s;ceptible of a pacific adju&s;tment.</P>
<P>In the wide field of We&s;tern territory, therefore, we perceive an ample theatre for ho&s;tile preten&s;ions, without any umpire or common judge to interpo&s;e between the contending parties. To rea&s;on from the pa&s;t to the future we &s;hall have good ground to ap|prehend, that the &s;word would &s;ometimes be appealed to as the arbiter of their differences. The circum|&s;tances

of the di&s;pute between Connecticut and Penn|&s;ylvania, re&s;pecting the lands at Wyoming, admoni&s;h us, not to be &s;anguine in expecting an ea&s;y accommo|dation of &s;uch differences. The articles of confede|ration obliged the parties to &s;ubmit the matter to the deci&s;ion of a federal court. The &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion was made, and the court decided in favour of Penn&s;yl|vania. But Connecticut gave &s;trong indications of di&s;&s;atisfaction with that determination; nor did &s;he appear to be intirely re&s;igned to it, till by negotiation and management &s;omething like an equivalent was found for the lo&s;s &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed her&s;elf to have &s;u&s;tained. Nothing here &s;aid is intended to convey the &s;lighte&s;t cen&s;ure on the conduct of that State. She no doubt &s;incerely believed her&s;elf to have been injured by the deci&s;ion; and &s;tates, like individuals, acquie&s;ce with great reluctance in determinations to their di&s;ad|vantage.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who had an opportunity of &s;eeing the in&s;ide of the tran&s;actions, which attended the progre&s;s of the controver&s;y between this &s;tate and the di&s;trict of Ver|mont, can vouch the oppo&s;ition we experienced, as well from &s;tates not intere&s;ted as from tho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e which were intere&s;ted in the cla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">m; and can atte&s;t the danger to which the peace of the confederacy might have been expo&s;ed, had this &s;tate attempted to a&s;&s;ert its rights by forc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. Two motives preponderated in that oppo|&s;ition&mdash;one a jealou&s;y entertained of our future power&mdash; and the other, the intere&s;t of certain individuals of in|fluence in the neighbouring &s;tates, who had obtained grants of lands under the actual government of that di&s;trict. Even the &s;tates which brought forward claims, in contradiction to ours, &s;eemed more &s;olici|tous to di&s;member this &s;tate, than to e&s;tabli&s;h their own preten&s;ions. The&s;e were New-Hamp&s;hire, Ma&s;|&s;achu&s;etts and Connecticut. New-Jer&s;ey and Rhode-I&s;land, upon all occa&s;ions, di&s;covered a warm zeal for the independence of Vermont; and Maryland, until alarmed by the appearance of a connection between

Canada and that place, entered deeply into the &s;ame views. The&s;e being &s;mall &s;tates, &s;aw with an un|friendly eye the per&s;pective of our growing greatne&s;s. In a review of the&s;e tran&s;actions we may trace &s;ome of the cau&s;es, which would be likely to embroil the &s;tates with each other, if it &s;hould be their unpropi|tious de&s;tiny to become di&s;united.</P>
<P>The competitions of commerce would be another fruitful &s;ource of contention. The &s;tates le&s;s favour|ably circum&s;tanced would be de&s;irous of e&s;caping from the di&s;advantages of local &s;ituation, and of &s;haring in the advantages of their more fortunate neighbours. Each &s;tate, or &s;eparate confederacy, would pur&s;ue a &s;y&s;tem of commercial polity peculiar to it&s;elf. This would occa&s;ion di&s;tinctions, preferences and exclu&s;ions, which would beget di&s;content. The habits of inter|cour&s;e, on the ba&s;is of equal privileges, to which we have been accu&s;tomed from the earlie&s;t &s;ettlement of the country, would give a keener edge to tho&s;e cau&s;es of di&s;content, than they would naturally have, inde|pendent of this circum&s;tance. <HI>We &s;hould be ready to denominate injuries tho&s;e things which were in reality the ju&s;tifiable acts of independent &s;overeignties con&s;ulting a di&s;tinct intere&s;t.</HI> The &s;pirit of enterpri&s;e, which cha|racteri&s;es the commercial part of America, has left no occa&s;ion of di&s;playing it&s;elf unimproved. It is not at all probable that this unbridled &s;pirit would pay much re&s;pect to tho&s;e regulations of trade, by which parti|cular &s;tates might endeavour to &s;ecure exclu&s;ive be|nefits to their own citizens. The infractions of the&s;e regulations on one &s;ide, the efforts to prevent and repel them on the other, would naturally lead to out|rages, and the&s;e to repri&s;als and wars.</P>
<P>The opportunities, which &s;ome &s;tates would have of rendering others tributary to them, by commercial regulations, would be impatiently &s;ubmitted to by the tributary &s;tates. The relative &s;ituation of New-York, Connecticut and New-Jer&s;ey, would afford an example of this kind. New-York, from the nece&s;&s;ities
<PB N="37" REF="021127_0042_0FB23BB0453FD770">
of revenue, mu&s;t lay duties on her importations. A great part of the&s;e duties mu&s;t be paid by the inha|bitants of the two other &s;tates in the capacity of con|&s;umers of what we import. New-York would neither be willing nor able to forego this advantage. Her citizens would not con&s;ent that a duty paid by them &s;hould be remitted in favour of the citizens of her neighbours; nor would it be practicable, if there were not this impediment in the way, to di&s;tingui&s;h the cu&s;tomers in our own markets. Would Connecticut and New-Jer&s;ey long &s;ubmit to be taxed by New-York for her exclu&s;ive benefit? Should we be long permitted to remain in the quiet and undi&s;turbed en|joyment of a metropolis, from the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of which we derived an advantage &s;o odious to our neighbours, and, in their opinion, &s;o oppre&s;&s;ive? Should we be able to pre&s;erve it again&s;t the incumbent weight of Connec|ticut on the one &s;ide, and the co-operating pre&s;&s;ure of New-Jer&s;ey on the other? The&s;e are que&s;tions that temerity alone will an&s;wer in the affirmative.</P>
<P>The public debt of the Union would be a further cau&s;e of colli&s;ion between the &s;eparate &s;tates or con|federacies. The apportionment, in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, and the progre&s;&s;ive extingui&s;hment, afterwards, would be alike productive of ill humour and animo&s;ity. How would it be po&s;&s;ible to agree upon a rule of apportion|ment &s;atisfactory to all? There is &s;carcely any, that can be propo&s;ed, which is intirely free from real ob|jections. The&s;e, as u&s;ual, would be exaggerated by the adver&s;e intere&s;ts of the parties. There are even di&s;&s;imilar views among the &s;tates, as to the general principle of di&s;charging the public debt. Some of them, either le&s;s impre&s;&s;ed with the importance of na|tional credit, or becau&s;e their citizens have little, if any, immediate intere&s;t in the que&s;tion, feel an indif|ference, if not a repugnance to the payment of the dome&s;tic debt, at any rate. The&s;e would be inclined to magnify the difficulties of a di&s;tribution. Others of them, a numerous body of who&s;e citizens are credi|tors
<PB N="38" REF="021127_0043_0FB23BB1C60365F0">
to the public, beyond the proportion of the &s;tate in the total amount of the national debt, would be &s;tre|nuous for &s;ome equitable and effectual provi&s;ion. The procra&s;tinations of the former would excite the re&s;ent|ments of the latter. The &s;ettlement of a rule would in the mean time be po&s;tponed, by real differences of opinion and affected delays. The citizens of the &s;tates intere&s;ted, would clamour, foreign powers would urge, for the &s;atisfaction of their ju&s;t demands; and the peace of the &s;tates would be hazarded to the double contin|gency of external inva&s;ion and internal contention.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e the difficulties of agreeing upon a rule &s;ur|mounted, and the apportionment made. Still there is great room to &s;uppo&s;e, that the rule agreed upon would, upon experiment, be found to bear harder upon &s;ome &s;tates than upon others. Tho&s;e which were &s;uf|ferers by it would naturally &s;eek for a mitigation of the burthen. The others would as naturally be di&s;|inclined to a revi&s;ion, which was likely to end in an increa&s;e of their own incumbrances. Their refu&s;al would be too plau&s;ible a pretext to the complaining &s;tates to withhold their contributions, not to be em|braced with avidity; and the non compliance of the&s;e &s;tates with their engagements would be a ground of bitter di&s;&s;ention and altercation. If even the rule adopted &s;hould in practice ju&s;tify the equality of its principle, &s;till delinquencies in payment, on the part of &s;ome of the States, would re&s;ult from a diver&s;ity of other cau&s;es&mdash;the real deficiency of re&s;ources&mdash;the mi&s;|management of their finances, accidental di&s;orders in the admini&s;tration of the government&mdash;and in addition to the re&s;t the reluctance with which men commonly part with money for purpo&s;es, that have outli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">d the exigencies which produced them, and interfere with the &s;upply of immediate wants. Delinquencies from whatever cau&s;es would be productive of complaints, recriminations and quarrels. There is perhaps nothing more likely to di&s;turb the tranquillity of nations, than their being bound to mutual contributions for
<PB N="39" REF="021127_0044_0FB23BB3459CC868">
any common object, which does not yield an equal and coincident benefit. For it is an ob&s;ervation as true, as it is trite, that there is nothing men differ &s;o readily about as the payment of money.</P>
<P>Laws in violation of private contracts as they amount to aggre&s;&s;ions on the rights of tho&s;e &s;tates, who&s;e citizens are inju<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed by them, may be con&s;i|dered as another probable &s;ource of ho&s;tility. We are not authori&s;ed to expect, that a more liberal or more equitable &s;pirit would pre&s;ide over the legi&s;lations of the individual &s;tates hereafter, if unre&s;trained by any additional cheeks, than we have heretofore &s;een, in too many in&s;tances, di&s;gracing their &s;everal codes. We have ob&s;erved the di&s;po&s;ition to retaliation ex|cited in Connecticut, in con&s;equences of the enor|mities perpetrated by the legi&s;lature of Rhode-I&s;land; and we may rea&s;onably infer, that in &s;imilar ca&s;es, under other circum&s;tances, a war not of <HI>parchment</HI> but of the &s;word would cha&s;ti&s;e &s;uch atrocious breaches of moral obligation and &s;ocial ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>The probability of incompatible alliances between the different &s;tates, or confederacies, and different foreign nations, and the effects of this &s;ituation upon the peace of the whole, have been &s;ufficiently unfolded in &s;ome preceding papers. From the view they have exhibited of this part, of the &s;ubject, this conclu&s;ion is to be drawn, that America, if not connected at all, or only by the feeble tie of a &s;imple league offen&s;ive and defen&s;ive, would by the operation of &s;uch oppo&s;ite and jarring alliances be gradually entangled in all the pernicious labyrinths of European politics and wars; and by the de&s;tructive contentions of the parts, into which &s;he was divided, would be likely to become a prey to the artifices and machinations of powers equally the enemies of them all. <HI>Divide et impera</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Divide and command.</NOTE> mu&s;t be the motto of every nation, that either hates, or fears us.</P>

<HEAD>NUMBER VIII. The Effects of internal War in producing &s;tanding Armies and other In&s;titutions un|friendly to Liberty.</HEAD>
<P>ASSUMING it therefore as an e&s;tabli&s;hed truth that the &s;everal &s;tates, in ca&s;e of di&s;union, or &s;uch combinations of them as might happen to be formed out of the wreck of the general confederacy, would be &s;ubject to tho&s;e vici&s;&s;itudes of peace and war, of friend&s;hip and enmity with each other, which have fallen to the lot of all neighbouring nations not united under one government, let us enter into a conci&s;e de|tail of &s;ome of the con&s;equences that would attend &s;uch a &s;ituation.</P>
<P>War between the &s;tates, in the fir&s;t periods of their &s;eparate exi&s;tence, would be accompanied with much greater di&s;tre&s;&s;es than it commonly is in tho&s;e coun|tries, where regular military e&s;tabli&s;hments have long obtained. The di&s;ciplined armies always kept on foot on the continent of Europe, though they bear a malignant a&s;pect to liberty and economy, have not|with&s;tanding been productive of the &s;ignal advantage of rendering &s;udden conque&s;ts impracticable, and of preventing that rapid de&s;olation, which u&s;ed to mark the progre&s;s of war, prior to their introduction. The art of fortification has contributed to the &s;ame ends. The nations of Europe are encircled with chains of fortified places, which mutually ob&s;truct inva&s;ion. Campaigns are wa&s;ted in reducing two or three fron|tier garri&s;ons, to gain admittance into an enemy's country. Similar imped<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ments occur at every &s;tep, to exhau&s;t the &s;trength and delay the progre&s;s of an invader. Formerly an invading army would pene|trate into the heart of a neighbouring country, almo&s;t as &s;oon as intelligence of its approach could be re|ceived;
<PB N="41" REF="021127_0046_0FB23BB646E8A188">
but now a comparitively &s;mall force of di&s;ci|plined troops, acting on the defen&s;ive with the aid of po&s;ts, is able to impede and finally to fru&s;trate the enterpri&s;es of one much more con&s;iderable. The hi&s;tory of war, in that quarter of the globe, is no longer a hi&s;tory of nations &s;ubdued and empires over|turned, but of towns taken and retaken, of battles that decide nothing, of retreats more beneficial than victories, of much effort and little acqui&s;ition.</P>
<P>In this country the &s;cene would be alogether re|ver&s;ed. The jealou&s;y of military e&s;tabli&s;hments, would po&s;tpone them as long as po&s;&s;ible. The want of for|tifications leaving the frontiers of one &s;tate open to another, would facilitate inroads. The populous &s;tates would with little difficulty over run their le&s;s populous neighbours. Conque&s;ts would be as ea&s;y to be made as difficult to be retained. War therefore would be de&s;ultory and predatory. Plunder and deva&s;tation ever march in the train of irregulars. The cala|mities of individuals would make the principal figure in the events, which would characteri&s;e our military exploits.</P>
<P>This picture is not too highly wrought, though I confe&s;s, it would not long remain a ju&s;t one. Safety from external danger is the mo&s;t powerful director of national conduct. Even the ardent love of liberty will, after a time, give way to its dictates. The violent de&s;truction of life and property incident to war&mdash;the continual effort and alarm attendant on a &s;tate of continual danger, will compel nations the mo&s;t attached to liberty, to re&s;ort for repo&s;e and &s;ecu|rity, to in&s;titutions, which have a tendency to de&s;troy their civil and political rights. To be more &s;afe they, at length, become willing to run the ri&s;k of being le&s;s free.</P>
<P>The in&s;titutions chiefly alluded to are STANDING ARMIES, and the corre&s;pondent appendages of mili|tary e&s;tabli&s;hment. Standing armies, it is &s;aid, are not provided again&s;t in the new con&s;titution, and it is
<PB N="42" REF="021127_0047_0FB23BB7C51AC728">
thence inferred that they would exi&s;t under it.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This objection will be fully examined in its proper place, and it will be &s;hown that the only rational precaution which could have been taken on this &s;ubject has been taken; and a much better one than is to be found in any con&s;titution that has been heretofore framed in America, mo&s;t of which contain no guard at all on this &s;ubject.</NOTE> This inference, from the very form of the propo&s;ition, is, at be&s;t, problematical and uncertain. But STANDING ARMIES, it may be replied, mu&s;t inevitably re&s;ult from a di&s;&s;olution of the confederacy. Frequent war, and con&s;tant apprehen&s;ion, which require a &s;tate of as con&s;tant preparation, will infallibly produce them. The weaker &s;tates, or confederacies, would fir&s;t have recour&s;e to them, to put them&s;elves upon an equality with their more potent neighbours. They would endeavour to &s;upply the inferiority of population and re&s;ources, by a more regular and effective &s;y&s;tem of defence, by di&s;ciplined troops and by fortifications. They would, at the &s;ame time, be nece&s;&s;itated to &s;trengthen the executive arm of government; in doing which, their con&s;titutions would acquire a pro|gre&s;&s;ive direction towards monarchy. It is of the nature of war to increa&s;e the executive at the expence of the legi&s;lative authority.</P>
<P>The expedients which have been mentioned would &s;oon give the &s;tates, or confederacies, that made u&s;e of them, a &s;uperiority over their neighbours. Small &s;tates, or &s;tates of le&s;s natural &s;trength, under vigorous governments, and with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of di&s;ciplined armies, have often triumphed over large &s;tates, or &s;tates of greater natural &s;trength, which have been de&s;titute of the&s;e advantages. Neither the pride, nor the &s;afety of the more important &s;tates, or confedera|cies, would permit them long to &s;ubmit to this morti|fying and adventitious inferiority. They would quickly re&s;ort to means &s;imilar to tho&s;e by which it had been effected, to rein&s;tate them&s;elves in their lo&s;t pre-eminence. Thus we &s;hould in a little time &s;ee e&s;tabli&s;hed in every part of this country, the &s;ame
<PB N="43" REF="021127_0048_0FB23BB944D7C2E8">
engines of de&s;poti&s;m which have been the &s;courge of the old world. This at lea&s;t would be the natural cour&s;e of things, and our rea&s;onings will be the more likely to be ju&s;t, in proportion as they are accommo|dated to this &s;tandard.</P>
<P>The&s;e are not vague inferences, drawn from &s;up|po&s;ed or &s;peculative defects in a con&s;titution, the whole power of which is lodged in the hands of the people, or their repre&s;entatives and delegates, but they are &s;olid conclu&s;ions drawn from the natural and nece&s;&s;ary progre&s;s of human affairs.</P>
<P>It may perhaps be a&s;ked, by way of objection to this, why did not &s;tanding armies &s;pring up out of the contentions which &s;o often di&s;tracted the ancient republics of Greece? Different an&s;wers equally &s;ati&s;|factory, may be given to this que&s;tion. The indu&s;|trious habits of the people of the pre&s;ent day, ab&s;orbed in the pur&s;uits of gain, and devoted to the improve|ments of agriculture and commerce, are incompatible with the condition of a nation of &s;oldiers, which was the true condition of the people of tho&s;e republics. The means of revenue, which have been &s;o greatly multiplied by the encrea&s;e of gold and &s;ilver, and of the arts of indu&s;try, and the &s;cience of finance, which is the offspring of modern times, concurring with the habits of nations, have produced an intire revolution in the &s;y&s;tem of war, and have rendered di&s;ciplined armies, di&s;tinct from the body of the citizens, the in&s;eparable companion of frequent ho&s;tility.</P>
<P>There is a wide difference al&s;o, between military e&s;tabli&s;hments in a country, &s;eldom expo&s;ed by its &s;ituation to internal inva&s;ions, and in one which is often &s;ubject to them, and always apprehen&s;ive of them. The rulers of the former can have no good pretext, if they are even &s;o inclined, to keep on foot armies &s;o numerous as mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity be maintained in the latter. The&s;e armies being, in the fir&s;t ca&s;e, rarely, if at all, called into activity for interior defence, the people are in no danger of being broken to mili|tary

&s;ubordination. The laws are not accu&s;tomed to relaxations, in favour of military exigencies&mdash;the civil &s;tate remains in full vigor, neither corrupted nor con|founded with the principles or propen&s;ities of the other &s;tate. The &s;mallne&s;s of the army renders the natural &s;trength of the community an overmatch for it, and the citizens, not habituated to look up to the military power for protection, or to &s;ubmit to its oppre&s;&s;ions, neither love nor fear the &s;oldiery: They view them with a &s;pirit of jealous acquie&s;cence in a nece&s;&s;ary evil, and &s;tand ready to re&s;i&s;t a power which they &s;up|po&s;e may be exerted to the prejudice of their rights.</P>
<P>The army under &s;uch circum&s;tances, may u&s;efully aid the magi&s;trate to &s;uppre&s;s a &s;mall faction, or an occa&s;ional mob, or in&s;urrection; but it will be unable to enforce encroachments again&s;t the united efforts of the great body of the people.</P>
<P>In a country, in the predicament la&s;t de&s;cribed, the contrary of all this happens. The perpetual menacings of danger oblige the government to be al|ways prepared to repel it&mdash;its armies mu&s;t be numerous enough for in&s;tant defence. The continual nece&s;&s;ity for their &s;ervices enhances the importance of the &s;oldier, and proportionally degrades the condition of the citizen. The military &s;tate becomes elevated above the civil. The inhabitants of territories, often the theatre of war, are unavoidably &s;ubjected to fre|quent infringements on their rights, which &s;erve to weaken their &s;en&s;e of tho&s;e rights; and by degrees, the people are brought to con&s;ider the &s;oldiery not only as their protectors, but as their &s;uperiors.

<HEAD>NUMBER IX. The Utility of the Union as a Safeguard again&s;t dome&s;tic Faction and In&s;urrection.</HEAD>
<P>A Firm union will be of the utmo&s;t moment to the peace and liberty of the &s;tates as a barrier again&s;t dome&s;tic faction and in&s;urrection. It is im|po&s;&s;ible to read the hi&s;tory of the petty republics of Greece and Italy, without feeling &s;en&s;ations of horror and di&s;gu&s;t at the di&s;tractions with which they were continually agitated, and at the rapid &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of re|volutions, by which they were kept in a &s;tate of per|petual vibration, between the extremes of tyranny and anarchy. If they exhibit occa&s;ional calms, the&s;e only &s;erve as &s;hortlived contra&s;ts to the furious &s;torms that are to &s;ucceed. If now and then intervals of felicity open them&s;elves to view, we behold them with a mixture of regret ari&s;ing from the reflection, that
<PB N="47" REF="021127_0052_0FB23BBF44E68058">
the plea&s;ing &s;cenes before us are &s;oon to be over|whelmed by the tempe&s;tuous waves of &s;edition and party rage. If momentary rays of glory break forth from the gloom, while they dazzle us with a tran&s;ient and fleeting brilliancy, they at the &s;ame time ad|moni&s;h us to lament that the vices of government &s;hould pervert the direction and tarni&s;h the lu&s;tre of tho&s;e bright talents and exalted endowments, for which the favoured &s;oils, that produced them, have been &s;o ju&s;tly celebrated.</P>
<P>From the di&s;orders that disfigure the annals of tho&s;e republics, the advocates of de&s;poti&s;m have drawn ar|guments, not only again&s;t the forms of republican government, but again&s;t the very principles of civil liberty. They have decried all free government, as incon&s;i&s;tent with the order of &s;ociety, and have in|dulged them&s;elves in malicious exultation over its friends and partizans. Happily for mankind, &s;tu|pendous fabrics reared on the ba&s;is of liberty, which have flouri&s;hed for ages, have in a few glorious in|&s;tances refuted their gloomy &s;ophi&s;ms And, I tru&s;t, America will be the broad and &s;olid foundation of other edifices not le&s;s magnificent, which will be equally permanent monuments of their errors.</P>
<P>But it is not to be denied that the portraits they have &s;ketched of republican government, were too ju&s;t copies of the originals from which they were taken. If it had been found impracticable, to have devi&s;ed models of a more perfect &s;tructure, the enlightened friends to liberty would have been obliged to abandon the cau&s;e of that &s;pecies of government as indefen|&s;ible. The &s;cience of politics, however, like mo&s;t other &s;ciences, has received great improvement. The efficacy of various principles is now well under&s;tood, which were either not known at all, or imperfectly known to the ancients. The regular di&s;tribution of power into di&s;tinct departments&mdash;the introduction of legi&s;lative ballances and checks&mdash;the in&s;titution of courts com|po&s;ed of judges, holding their offices during good
<PB N="48" REF="021127_0053_0FB23BC0C51DE7F0">
behaviour&mdash;the repre&s;entation of the people in the legi&s;lature by deputies of their own election&mdash;the&s;e are either wholly new di&s;coveries, or have made their principal progre&s;s towards perfection in modern times. They are means, and powerful means, by which the excellencies of republican government may be retained, and its imperfections le&s;&s;ened or avoided. To this catalogue of circum&s;tances, that tend to the amelioration of popular &s;y&s;tems of civil government, I &s;hall venture, however novel it may appear to &s;ome, to add one more on a principle, which has been made the foundation of an objection to the new con&s;titution, I mean the ENLARGEMENT of the ORBIT within which &s;uch &s;y&s;tems are to revolve, either in re&s;pect to the dimen&s;ions of a &s;ingle &s;tate, or to the con&s;olidation of &s;everal &s;maller &s;tates into one great confederacy. The latter is that which immediately concerns the object under con&s;ideration. It will however be of u&s;e to examine the principle in its application to a &s;ingle &s;tate, which &s;hall be attended to in another place.</P>
<P>The utility of a confederacy, as well to &s;uppre&s;s faction and to guard the internal tranquility of &s;tates, as to increa&s;e their external force and &s;ecurity, is in reality not a new idea. It has been practiced upon in different countries and ages, and has received the &s;anction of the mo&s;t applauded writers on the &s;ubjects of politics. The opponents of the PLAN propo&s;ed have with great a&s;&s;iduity cited and circulated the ob|&s;ervations of Monte&s;quieu on the nece&s;&s;ity of a con|tracted territory for a republican government. But they &s;eem not to have been appri&s;ed of the &s;entiments of that great man expre&s;&s;ed in another part of his work, nor to have adverted to the con&s;equences of the principle to which they &s;ub&s;cribe, with &s;uch ready acquie&s;cence.</P>
<P>When Monte&s;quieu recommends a &s;mall extent for republics, the &s;tandards he had in view were of dimen|&s;ions, far &s;hort of the limits of almo&s;t every one of the&s;e &s;tates. Neither Virginia, Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts,
<PB N="49" REF="021127_0054_0FB23BC2454C0888">
Penn&s;ylvania, New-York, North-Carolina nor Geor|gia, can by any means be compared with the models from which he rea&s;oned, and to which the terms of his de&s;cription apply. If we therefore take his ideas on this point, as the criterion of truth, we &s;hall be driven to the alternative, either of taking refuge at once in the arms of monarchy, or of &s;plitting our&s;elves into an infinity of little, jealous, cla&s;hing, tumultuous commonwealths, the wretched nur&s;eries of uncea&s;ing di&s;cord and the mi&s;erable objects of univer&s;al pity or contempt. Some of the writers, who have come for|ward on the other &s;ide of the que&s;tion, &s;eem to have been aware of the dilemma; and have even been bold enough to hint at the divi&s;ion of the larger &s;tates, as a de&s;irable thing. Such an infatuated policy, &s;uch a de&s;|perate expedient, might, by the multiplication of petty offices an&s;wer the views of men, who po&s;&s;e&s;s not quali|fications to extend their influence beyond the narrow circles of per&s;onal intrigue, but it could never promote the greatne&s;s or happine&s;s of the people of America.</P>
<P>Referring the examination of the principle it&s;elf to another place, as has been already mentioned, it will be &s;ufficient to remark here, that in the &s;en&s;e of the author who has been mo&s;t emphatically quoted upon the occa&s;ion, it would only dictate a reduction of the SIZE of the more con&s;iderable MEMBERS of the union; but would not militate again&s;t their being all comprehended in one confederate government. And this is the true que&s;tion, in the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of which we are at pre&s;ent intere&s;ted.</P>
<P>So far are the &s;ugge&s;tions of Monte&s;quieu from &s;tanding in oppo&s;ition to a general union of the &s;tates, that he explicitly treats of a CONFEDERATE RE|PUBLIC as the expedient for extending the &s;phere of popular government and reconciling the advantages of monarchy with tho&s;e of republicani&s;m.</P>

<P>This form of government is a convention, by which &s;everal &s;maller <HI>&s;tates</HI> agree to become mem|bers of a larger <HI>one,</HI> which they intend to form.

<P>A republic of this kind, able to with&s;tand an ex|ternal force, may &s;upport it&s;elf without any internal corruption. The form of this &s;ociety prevents all manner of inconveniences.</P>
<P>If a &s;ingle member &s;hould attempt to u&s;urp the &s;upreme authority, he could not be &s;uppo&s;ed to have an equal authority and credit in all the confederate &s;tates. Were he to have too great influence over one, this would alarm the re&s;t. Were he to &s;ubdue a part, that which would &s;till remain free might oppo&s;e him with forces, independent of tho&s;e which he had u&s;urped, and overpower him before he could be &s;ettled in his u&s;urpation.</P>
<P>Should a popular in&s;urrection happen in one of the confederate &s;tates, the others are able to quell it. Should abu&s;es creep into one part, they are reformed by tho&s;e that remain &s;ound.

<P>As this government is compo&s;ed of &s;mall republics it enjoys the internal happine&s;s of each, and with re&s;pect to its external &s;ituation it is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, by means of the a&s;&s;ociation of all the advantages of large monarchies.</P></Q>

<P>A di&s;tinction, more &s;ubtle than accurate, has been rai&s;ed between a <HI>confederacy</HI> and a <HI>con&s;olidation</HI> of the &s;tates. The e&s;&s;ential characteri&s;tic of the fir&s;t is &s;aid to be, the re&s;triction of its authority to the members in their collective capacities, without reaching to the individuals of whom they are compo&s;ed. It is con|tended that the national council ought to have no concern with any object of internal admini&s;tration. An exact equality of &s;uffrage between the members has al&s;o been in&s;i&s;ted upon as a leading feature of a confederate government. The&s;e po&s;itions are in the main arbitrary; they are &s;upported neither by prin|ciple nor precedent. It has indeed happened that governments of this kind have generally operated in the manner, which the di&s;tinction, taken notice of, &s;uppo&s;es to be inherent in their nature&mdash;but there have been in mo&s;t of them exten&s;ive exceptions to the practice, which &s;erve to prove, as far as example will go, that there is no ab&s;olute rule on the &s;ubject.

<P>The definition of a <HI>confederate republic</HI> &s;eems &s;imply to be, an "a&s;&s;emblage of &s;ocieties," or an a&s;&s;ociation of two or more &s;tates into one &s;tate.

He will not fail therefore to &s;et a due value on any plan which, without violating the principles to which he is attached, provides a proper cure for it. The in&s;ta|bility, inju&s;tice and confu&s;ion introduced into the public councils, have in truth been the mortal di&s;ea&s;es under which popular governments have every where peri&s;hed; as they continue to be the favorite and fruitful topics from which the adver&s;aries to liberty derive their mo&s;t &s;pecious declamations. The valu|able improvements made by the American con&s;titu|tions on the popular models, both ancient and modern, cannot certainly be too much admired; but it would be an unwarrantable partiality, to contend that they have as effectually obviated the danger on this &s;ide as was wi&s;hed and expected. Complaints are every where heard from our mo&s;t con&s;iderate and virtuous citizens, equally the friends of public and private faith, and of public and per&s;onal liberty; that our governments are too un&s;table; that the public good is di&s;regarded in the conflicts of rival parties; and that mea&s;ures are too often decided, not according to the rules of ju&s;tice, and the rights of the minor party; but by the &s;uperior force of an intere&s;ted and over|bearing majority. However anxiou&s;ly we may wi&s;h that the&s;e complaints had no foundation, the evidence of known facts will not permit us to deny that they are in &s;ome degree true. It will be found indeed, on a candid review of our &s;ituation, that &s;ome of the di&s;tre&s;&s;es under which we labor, have been erroneou&s;ly charged on the operation of our governments; but it will be found at the &s;ame time, that other cau&s;es will not alone account for many of our heavie&s;t misfortunes; and particularly, for that prevailing and increa&s;ing di&s;tru&s;t of public engagements, and alarm for private rights, which are echoed from one end of the con|tinent to the other. The&s;e mu&s;t be chiefly, if not

<P>By a faction I under&s;tand a number of citizens, whether amounting to a majority or minority of the whole, who are united and actuated by &s;ome common impul&s;e of pa&s;&s;ion, or of intere&s;t, adver&s;e to the rights of other citizens, or to the permanent and aggregate intere&s;ts of the community.</P>
<P>There are two methods of curing the mi&s;chiefs of faction: The one, by removing its cau&s;es; the other, by controling its effects.</P>
<P>There are again two methods of removing the cau&s;es of faction: The one by de&s;troying the liberty which is e&s;&s;ential to its exi&s;tence; the other, by giving to every citizen the &s;ame opinions, the &s;ame pa&s;&s;ions, and the &s;ame intere&s;ts.</P>
<P>It could never be more truly &s;aid than of the fir&s;t remedy, that it is wor&s;e than the di&s;ea&s;e. Liberty is to faction, what air is to fire, an aliment without which it in&s;tantly expires. But it could not be a le&s;s folly to aboli&s;h liberty, which is e&s;&s;ential to political life, be|cau&s;e it nouri&s;hes faction, than it would be to wi&s;h the annihilation of air, which is e&s;&s;ential to animal life, becau&s;e it imparts to fire its de&s;tructive agency.</P>
<P>The &s;econd expedient is as impracticable, as the fir&s;t would be unwi&s;e. As long as the rea&s;on of man continues fallible, and he is at liberty to exerci&s;e it, different opinions will be formed. As long as the connection &s;ub&s;i&s;ts between his rea&s;on and his &s;elf-love, his opinions and his pa&s;&s;ions will have a reci|procal influence on each other; and the former will be objects to which the latter will attach them&s;elves.

<P>The latent cau&s;es of faction are thus &s;own in the nature of man; and we &s;ee them every where brought into different degrees of activity, according to the different circum&s;tances of civil &s;ociety. A zeal for different opinions concerning religion, concerning government, and many other points, as well of &s;pe|culation as of practice; an attachment to different leaders ambitiou&s;ly contending for pre-eminence and power; or to per&s;ons of other de&s;criptions who&s;e for|tunes have been intere&s;ting to the human pa&s;&s;ions, have in turn divided mankind into parties, inflamed them with mutual animo&s;ity, and rendered them much more di&s;po&s;ed to vex and oppre&s;s each other, than to co-operate for their common good. So &s;trong is this propen&s;ity of mankind to fall into mutual animo&s;ities, that where no &s;ub&s;tantial occa&s;ion pre&s;ents it&s;elf, the mo&s;t frivolous and fanciful di&s;tinctions have been &s;uf|ficient to kindle their unfriendly pa&s;&s;ions, and excite their mo&s;t violent conflicts. But the mo&s;t common and durable &s;ource of factions, has been the various and unequal di&s;tribution of property. Tho&s;e who hold, and tho&s;e who are without property, have ever formed di&s;tinct intere&s;ts in &s;ociety. Tho&s;e who are creditors, and tho&s;e who are debtors, fall under a like di&s;crimi|nation. A landed intere&s;t, a manufacturing intere&s;t, a mercantile intere&s;t, a monied intere&s;t, with many le&s;&s;er intere&s;ts, grow up of nece&s;&s;ity in civilized nations, and divide them into different cla&s;&s;es, actuated by different &s;entiments and views. The regulation of the&s;e various and interfering intere&s;ts forms the prin|cipal ta&s;k of modern legi&s;lation, and involves the &s;pirit of party and faction in the nece&s;&s;ary and ordinary ope|rations of government.</P>
<P>No man is allowed to be a judge in his own cau&s;e; becau&s;e his intere&s;t would certainly bias his judg|ment,

Is a law propo&s;ed concerning private deb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s? It is a que&s;tion to which the creditors are parties on one &s;ide, and the debtors on the other. Ju&s;tice ought to hold the balance between them. Yet the parties are and mu&s;t be them&s;elves the judges; and the mo&s;t numerous party, or, in other words, the mo&s;t powerful faction mu&s;t be expected to prevail. Shall dome&s;tic manufactures be encouraged, and in what degree, by re&s;trictions on foreign manufactures? Are que&s;tions which would be differently decided by the landed and the manufacturing cla&s;&s;es; and probably by neither, with a &s;ole regard to ju&s;tice and the public good. The apportionment of taxes on the various de&s;criptions of property, is an act which &s;eems to require the mo&s;t exact impartiality, yet there is perhaps no legi&s;lative act in which greater opportunity and temptation are given to a predominant party, to trample on the rules of ju&s;tice. Every &s;hilling with which they over-burden the inferior number, is a &s;hilling &s;aved to their own pockets.</P>
<P>It is in vain to &s;ay, that enlightened &s;tate&s;men will be able to adju&s;t the&s;e cla&s;hing intere&s;ts, and render them all &s;ub&s;ervient to the public good. Enlightened &s;tate&s;men will not always be at the helm: Nor, in many ca&s;es, can &s;uch an adju&s;tment be made at all, without taking into view indirect and remote con&s;i|derations, which will rarely prevail over the imme|diate intere&s;t which one party may find in di&s;regarding the rights of another, or the good of the whole.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="021127_0062_0FB23BCE46D315E8">The inference to which we are brought, is, that the <HI>cau&s;es</HI> of faction cannot be removed; and that relief is only to be &s;ought in the means of controling its <HI>effects.</HI></P>
<P>If a faction con&s;i&s;ts of le&s;s than a majority, relief is &s;upplied by the republican principle, which enables the majority to defeat its &s;ini&s;ter views by regular vote: It may clog the admini&s;tration, it may convul&s;e the &s;ociety; but it will be unable to execute and ma&s;k its violence under the forms of the con&s;titution. When a majority is included in a faction, the form of popular government on the other hand enables it to &s;acrifice to its ruling pa&s;&s;ion or intere&s;t, both the public good and the rights of other citizens. To &s;ecure the public good, and private rights again&s;t the danger of &s;uch a faction, and at the &s;ame time to pre&s;erve the &s;pirit and the form of popular government, is then the great object to which our enquiries are directed. Let me add that it is the great de&s;ideratum, by which alone this form of government can be re&s;cued from the opprobrium under which it has &s;o long labored, and be recommended to the e&s;teem and adoption of mankind.</P>
<P>By what means is this object attainable? Evidently by one of two only. Either the exi&s;tence of the &s;ame pa&s;&s;ion or intere&s;t in a majority at the &s;ame time, mu&s;t be prevented; or the majority, having &s;uch co-exi&s;tent pa&s;&s;ion or intere&s;t, mu&s;t be rendered, by their number and local &s;ituation, unable to concert and carry into effect &s;chemes of oppre&s;&s;ion. If the impul&s;e and the opportunity be &s;uffered to coincide, we well know that neither moral nor religious motives can be relied on as an adequate control. They are not found to be &s;uch on the inju&s;tice and violence of individuals, and lo&s;e their efficacy in proporti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n to the number com|bined together; that is, in proportion as their efficacy becomes needful.</P>
<P>From this view of the &s;ubject, it may be concluded, that a pure democracy, by which I mean a &s;ociety,
<PB N="58" REF="021127_0063_0FB23BCFC5426F80">
con&s;i&s;ting of a &s;mall number of citizens, who a&s;&s;emble and admini&s;ter the government in per&s;on, can admit of no cure for the mi&s;chiefs of faction. A common pa&s;&s;ion or intere&s;t will, in almo&s;t every ca&s;e, be felt by a majority of the whole; a communication and con|cert re&s;ults from the form of government it&s;elf; and there is nothing to check the inducements to &s;acrifice the weaker party, or an obnoxious individual. Hence it is, that &s;uch democracies have ever been &s;pectacles of turbulence and contention; have ever been found incompatible with per&s;onal &s;ecurity, or the rights of property; and have in general been as &s;hort in their lives, as they have been violent in their deaths.&mdash; Theoretic politicians, who have patronized this &s;pecies of government, have erroneou&s;ly &s;uppo&s;ed, that by re|ducing mankind to a perfect equality in their political rights, they would, at the &s;ame time, be perfectly equallized and a&s;&s;imilated in their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, their opinions, and their pa&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>A republic, by which I mean a government in which the &s;cheme of repre&s;entation takes place, opens a different pro&s;pect, and promi&s;es the cure for which we are &s;eeking. Let us examine the points in which it varies from pure democracy, and we &s;hall compre|hend both the nature of the cure, and the efficacy which it mu&s;t derive from the union.</P>
<P>The two great points of difference between a demo|cracy and a republic, are, fir&s;t, the delegation of the government, in the latter, to a &s;mall number of citi|zens elected by the re&s;t; &s;econdly, the greater number of citizens, and greater &s;phere of country, over which the latter may be extended.</P>
<P>The effect of the fir&s;t difference is, on the one hand, to refine and enlarge the public views, by pa&s;&s;ing them through the medium of a cho&s;en body of citizens, who&s;e wi&s;dom may be&s;t di&s;cern the true intere&s;t of their country, and who&s;e patrioti&s;m and love of ju&s;tice, will be lea&s;t likely to &s;acrifice it to temporary or partial con&s;iderations. Under &s;uch a regulation, it may well
<PB N="59" REF="021127_0064_0FB23BD145B56148">
happen that the public voice pronounced by the repre|&s;entatives of the people, will be more con&s;onant to the public good, than if pronounced by the people them|&s;elves convened for the purpo&s;e. On the other hand, the effect may be inverted. Men of factious tem|pers, of local prejudices, or of &s;ini&s;ter de&s;igns, may by intrigue, by corruption, or by other means, fir&s;t obtain the &s;uffrages, and then betray the intere&s;ts of the people. The que&s;tion re&s;ulting is, whether &s;mall or exten&s;ive republics are mo&s;t favourable to the elec|tion of proper guardians of the public weal; and it is clearly decided in favour of the latter by two obvious con&s;iderations.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place it is to be remarked, that however &s;mall the republic may be, the repre&s;entatives mu&s;t be rai&s;ed to a certain number, in order to guard again&s;t the cabals of a few; and that however large it may be, they mu&s;t be limited to a certain number, in order to guard again&s;t the confu&s;ion of a multitude. Hence the number of repre&s;entatives in the two ca&s;es not being in proportion to that of the con&s;tituents, and being proportionally greate&s;t in the &s;mall republic, it follows, that if the proportion of fit characters be not le&s;s in the large than in the &s;mall republic, the former will pre&s;ent a greater option, and con&s;equently a greater probability of a fit choice.</P>
<P>In the next place, as each repre&s;entative will be cho&s;en by a greater number of citizens in the large than in the &s;mall republic, it will be more difficult for unworthy candidates to practi&s;e with &s;ucce&s;s the vicious arts, by which elections are too often carried; and the &s;uffrages of the people being more free, will be more likely to centre on men who po&s;&s;e&s;s the mo&s;t attrac|tive merit, and the mo&s;t diffu&s;ive and e&s;tabli&s;hed characters.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that in this, as in mo&s;t other ca&s;es, there is a mean, on both &s;ides of which incon|veniencies will be found to lie. By enlarging too much the number of electors, you render the repre|&s;entative
<PB N="60" REF="021127_0065_0FB23BD2C5B230E0">
too little acquainted with all their local cir|cum&s;tances and le&s;&s;er intere&s;ts; as by reducing it too much, you render him unduly attached to the&s;e, and too little fit to comprehend and pur&s;ue great and national objects. The federal con&s;titution forms a happy combination in this re&s;pect; the great and aggregate intere&s;ts being referred to the national, the local and particular to the &s;tate legi&s;latures</P>
<P>The other point of difference is, the greater num|ber of citizens and extent of territory which may be brought within the compa&s;s of republican, than of democratic government; and it is this circum&s;tance principally which renders factious combinations le&s;s to to be dreaded in the former, than in the latter. The &s;maller the &s;ociety, the fewer probably will be the di&s;tinct parties and intere&s;ts compo&s;ing it; the fewer the di&s;tinct parties and intere&s;ts, the more frequently will a majority be found of the &s;ame party; and the &s;maller the number of individuals compo&s;ing a majo|rity, and the &s;maller the compa&s;s within which they are placed, the more ea&s;ily will they concert and execute their plans of oppre&s;&s;ion. Extend the &s;phere, and you take in a greater variety of parties and inte|re&s;ts; you make it le&s;s probable that a majority of the whole will have a common motive to invade the rights of other citizens; or if &s;uch a common motive exi&s;ts, it will be more difficult for all who feel it to di&s;cover their own &s;trength, and to act in uni&s;on with each other. Be&s;ides other impediments, it may be remarked, that where there is a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of unju&s;t or di&s;honorable purpo&s;es, communication is always checked by di&s;tru&s;t, in proportion to the number who&s;e concurrence is nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>Hence it clearly appears, that the &s;ame advantage, which a republic has over a democracy, in controling the effects of faction, is enjoyed by a large over a &s;mall republic&mdash;is enjoyed by the union over the &s;tates com|po&s;ing it. Does this advantage con&s;i&s;t in the &s;ub&s;ti|tution of repre&s;entatives, who&s;e enlightened views and
<PB N="61" REF="021127_0066_0FB23BD45CAD81C8">
virtuous &s;entiments render them &s;uperior to local prejudices, and to &s;chemes of inju&s;tice? It will not be denied, that the repre&s;entation of the union will be mo&s;t likely to po&s;&s;e&s;s the&s;e requi&s;ite endowments. Does it con&s;i&s;t in the greater &s;ecurity afforded by a greater variety of parties, again&s;t the event of any one party being able to outnumber and oppre&s;s the re&s;t? In an equal degree does the encrea&s;ed variety of parties, compri&s;ed within the union, encrea&s;e this &s;ecurity. Does it, in fine, con&s;i&s;t in the greater ob&s;tacles oppo&s;ed to the concert and accompli&s;hment of the &s;ecret wi&s;hes of an unju&s;t and intere&s;ted majo|rity? Here, again, the extent of the union gives it the mo&s;t palpable advantage.</P>
<P>The influence of factious leaders may kindle a flame within their particular &s;tates, but will be unable to &s;pread a general conflagration through the other &s;tates: A religious &s;ect, may degenerate into a political faction in a part of the confederacy; but the variety of &s;ects di&s;per&s;ed over the entire face of it, mu&s;t &s;ecure the national councils again&s;t any danger from that &s;ource: A rage for paper money, for an abolition of debts, for an equal divi&s;ion of property, or for any other improper or wicked project, will be le&s;s apt to pervade the whole body of the union, than a particular member of it; in the &s;ame proportion as &s;uch a malady is more likely to taint a particular county or di&s;trict, than an entire &s;tate.</P>
<P>In the extent and proper &s;tructure of the union, therefore, we behold a republican remedy for the di&s;ea&s;es mo&s;t incident to republican government. And according to the degree of plea&s;ure and pride, we feel in being republicans, ought to be our zeal in cheri&s;hing the &s;pirit, and &s;upporting the character of federali&s;ts.</P>

<HEAD>NUMBER XI. The Utility of the Union in Re&s;pect to Com|merce and a Navy.</HEAD>
<P>THE importance of the union, in a commercial light, is one of tho&s;e points, about which there is lea&s;t room to entertain a difference of opinion, and which has in fact commanded the mo&s;t general a&s;&s;ent of men, who have any acquaintance with the &s;ubject. This applies as well to our intercour&s;e with foreign countries, as with each other.</P>
<P>There are appearances to authori&s;e a &s;uppo&s;ition, that the adventurous &s;pirit, which di&s;tingui&s;hes the commercial character of America, has already excited unea&s;y &s;en&s;ations in &s;everal of the maritime powers of Europe. They &s;eem to be apprehen&s;ive of our too great interference in that carrying trade, which is the &s;upport of their navigation and the foundation of their naval &s;trength. Tho&s;e of them, which have colo|nies in America, look forward, to what this country is capable of becoming, with painful &s;olicitude. They fore&s;ee the dangers, that may threaten their American dominions from the neighbourhood of &s;tates, which have all the di&s;po&s;itions, and would po&s;&s;e&s;s all the means, requi&s;ite to the creation of a powerful marine. Impre&s;&s;ions of this kind will naturally indicate the policy of fo&s;tering divi&s;ions among us, and of depriv|ing us as far as po&s;&s;ible of an ACTIVE COMMERCE in our own bottoms. This would an&s;wer the three|fold purpo&s;e of preventing our interference in their navigation, of monopoli&s;ing the profits of our trade, and of clipping the wings, by which we might &s;oar to a dangerous greatne&s;s. Did not prudence forbid the detail, it would not be difficult to trace by facts the workings of this policy to the cabinets of mini&s;ters.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="021127_0068_0FB23BD74828D630">If we continue united, we may counteract a policy &s;o unfriendly to our pro&s;perity in a variety of ways. By prohibitory regulations, extending at the &s;ame time throughout the &s;tates, we may oblige foreign countries to bid again&s;t each other, for the privileges of our markets. This a&s;&s;ertion will not appear chi|merical to tho&s;e who are able to appreciate the impor|tance to any manufacturing nation of the markets of three millions of people&mdash;increa&s;ing in rapid progre&s;|&s;ion, for the mo&s;t part exclu&s;ively addicted to agricul|ture, and likely from local circum&s;tances to remain in this di&s;po&s;ition; and the immen&s;e difference there would be to the trade and navigation of &s;uch a nation, between a direct communication in its own &s;hips, and an indirect conveyance of its products and returns, to and from America, in the &s;hips of another country. Suppo&s;e, for in&s;tance, we had a government in Ame|rica, capable of excluding Great-Britain (with whom we have at pre&s;ent no treaty of commerce) from all our ports, what would be the probable operation of this &s;tep upon her politics? Would it not enable us to negotiate with the faire&s;t pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s for commercial privileges of the mo&s;t valuable and exten|&s;ive kind in the dominions of that kingdom? When the&s;e que&s;tions have been a&s;ked, upon other occa&s;ions, they have received a plau&s;ible but not a &s;olid or &s;ati&s;|factory an&s;wer. It has been &s;aid, that prohibitions on our part would produce no change in the &s;y&s;tem of Britain; becau&s;e &s;he could pro&s;ecute her trade with us, through the medium of the Dutch, who would be her immediate cu&s;tomers and pay-ma&s;ters for tho&s;e articles which were wanted for the &s;upply of our markets. But would not her navigation be mate|rially injured, by the lo&s;s of the important advantage of being her own carrier in that trade? Would not the principal part of its profits be intercepted by the Dutch, as a compen&s;ation for their agency and ri&s;k? Would not the mere circum&s;tance of freight occa&s;ion a con&s;iderable deduction? Would not &s;o circuitous an

intercour&s;e facilitate the competitions of other nations, by enchancing the price of Briti&s;h commodities in our markets, and by transferring to other hands the management of this intere&s;ting branch of the Briti&s;h commerce?</P>
<P>A mature con&s;ideration of the objects, &s;ugge&s;ted by the&s;e que&s;tions, will ju&s;tify a belief, that the real di&s;advantages to Great Britain, from &s;uch a &s;tate of things, con&s;piring with the prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of a great part of the nation in favour of the American trade, and with the importunities of the We&s;t-India i&s;lands, would produce a relaxation in her pre&s;ent &s;y&s;tem, and would let us into the enjoyment of privileges in the markets of tho&s;e i&s;lands and el&s;ewhere, from which our trade would derive the mo&s;t &s;ub&s;tantial benefits. Such a point gained from the Briti&s;h government, and which could not be expected without an equi|valent in exemptions and immunities in our mar|kets, would be likely to have a corre&s;pondent effect on the conduct of other nations, who would not be inclined to &s;ee them&s;elves altogether &s;upplanted in our trade.</P>
<P>A further re&s;ource for influencing the conduct of European nations towards us, in this re&s;pect would ari&s;e from the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a federal navy. There can be no doubt, that the continuance of the union, under an efficient government, would put it in our power, at a period not very di&s;tant, to create a navy, which, if it could not vie with tho&s;e of the great ma|ritime powers, would at lea&s;t be of re&s;pectable weight if thrown into the &s;cale of either of two contending parties. This would be more particularly the ca&s;e in relation to operations in the We&s;t-Indies. A few &s;hips of the line &s;ent opportunely to the reinforcement of either &s;ide, would often be &s;ufficient to decide the fate of a campaign, on the event of which intere&s;ts of the greate&s;t magnitude were &s;u&s;pended. Our po&s;ition is in this re&s;pect a very commanding one. And if to this con&s;ideration we add that of the u&s;efulne&s;s of
<PB N="65" REF="021127_0070_0FB23BDACEE90FF8">
&s;upplies from this country, in the pro&s;ecution of mili|tary operations in the We&s;t-Indies, it will readily be perceived, that a &s;ituation &s;o favourable would enable us to bargain with great advantage for com|mercial privileges. A price would be &s;et not only upon our friend&s;hip, but upon our neutrality. By a &s;teady adherance to the union we may hope ere long to become the arbiter of Europe in America; and to be able to incline the balance of European compe|titions in this part of the world as our intere&s;t may dictate.</P>
<P>But in the rever&s;e of this eligible &s;ituation we &s;hall di&s;cover, that the rival&s;hips of the parts would make them checks upon each other, and would fru&s;trate all the tempting advantages, which nature has kindly placed within our reach. In a &s;tate &s;o in&s;ignificant, our commerce would be a prey to the wanton inter|meddlings of all nations at war with each other; who, having nothing to fear from us, would with little &s;cruple or remor&s;e &s;upply their wants by depre|dations on our property, as often as it fell in their way. The rights of neutrality will only be re&s;pected, when they are defended by an adequate power. A nation, de&s;picable by its weakne&s;s, forfeits even the privilege of being neutral.</P>
<P>Under a vigorous national government, the natural &s;trength and re&s;ources of the country, directed to a common intere&s;t, would baffle all the combinations of European jealou&s;y to re&s;train our growth. This &s;ituation would even take away the motive to &s;uch combinations, by inducing an impracticability of &s;ucce&s;s. An active commerce, an exten&s;ive navi|gation, a flouri&s;hing marine would then be the inevi|table offspring of moral and phy&s;ical nece&s;&s;ity. We might defy the little arts of little politicians to con|troul, or vary, the irre&s;i&s;tible and unchangeable cour&s;e of nature.</P>
<P>But in a &s;tate of di&s;union the&s;e combinations might exi&s;t, and might operate with &s;ucce&s;s. It would be
<PB N="66" REF="021127_0071_0FB23BDBC7E2C0C8">
in the power of the maritime nations, availing them|&s;elves of our univer&s;al impotence, to pre&s;cribe the conditions of our political exi&s;tence; and as they have a common intere&s;t in being our carriers, and &s;till more in preventing our being theirs, they would in all pro|bability combine to embarra&s;s our navigation in &s;uch a manner, as would in effect de&s;troy it, and confine us to a PASSIVE COMMERCE. We &s;hould thus be compelled to content our&s;elves with the fir&s;t price of our commodities, and to &s;ee the profits of our trade &s;natched from us to enrich our enemies and per&s;e|cutors. That unequalled &s;pirit of enterpri&s;e, which &s;ignali&s;es the genius of the American merchants and navigators, and which is in it&s;elf an inexhau&s;tible mine of national wealth, would be &s;tifled and lo&s;t; and poverty and di&s;grace would over&s;pread a country, which with wi&s;dom might make her&s;elf the admiration and envy of the world.</P>
<P>There are rights of great moment to the trade of America, which are rights of the union&mdash;I allude to the fi&s;heries, to the navigation of the Lakes and to that of the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi. The di&s;&s;olution of the confe|deracy would give room for delicate que&s;tions, con|cerning the future exi&s;tence of the&s;e rights; which the intere&s;t of more powerful partners would hardly fail to &s;olve to our di&s;advantage. The di&s;po&s;ition of Spain with regard to the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi needs no com|ment. France and Britain are concerned with us in the fi&s;heries; and view them as of the utmo&s;t moment to their navigation. They, of cour&s;e, would hardly remain long indifferent to that decided ma&s;tery of which experience has &s;hown us to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in this valuable branch of traffic; and by which we are able to under&s;ell tho&s;e nations in their own markets. What more natural, than that they &s;hould be di&s;po&s;ed to ex|clude, from the li&s;ts, &s;uch dangerous competitors?</P>
<P>This branch of trade ought not to be con&s;idered as a partial benefit. All the navigating &s;tates may in different degrees advantageou&s;ly participate in it, and
<PB N="67" REF="021127_0072_0FB23BDD468ECD70">
under circum&s;tances of a greater exten&s;ion of mer|cantile capital would not be unlikely to do it. As a nur&s;ery of &s;eamen it now is, or when time &s;hall have more nearly a&s;&s;imilated the principles of navi|gation in the &s;everal &s;tates, will become an univer&s;al re&s;ource. To the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a navy it mu&s;t be indi&s;pen&s;ible.</P>
<P>To this great national object, a NAVY, union will contribute in various ways. Every in&s;titution will grow and flouri&s;h in proportion to the quantity and extent of the means concentered towards its formation and &s;upport. A navy of the United States, as it would embrace the re&s;ources of all, is an object far le&s;s remote than a navy of any &s;ingle &s;tate, or partial confederacy, which would only embrace the re&s;ources of a part. It happens indeed that different portions of confederated America po&s;&s;e&s;s each &s;ome peculiar advantage for this e&s;&s;ential e&s;tabli&s;hment. The more Southern &s;tates furni&s;h in greater abundance certain kinds of naval &s;tores&mdash;tar, pitch and turpentine. Their wood for the con&s;truction of &s;hips is al&s;o of a more &s;olid and la&s;ting texture. The difference in the duration of the &s;hips of which the navy might be compo&s;ed, if chiefly con&s;tructed of Southern wood would be of &s;ignal importance either in the view of naval &s;trength or of national economy. Some of the Southern and of the middle &s;tates yield a greater plenty of iron and of better quality. Seamen mu&s;t chiefly be drawn from the Nothern hive. The nece&s;&s;ity of naval protection to external or maritime commerce, and the conducive|ne&s;s of that &s;pecies of commerce to the pro&s;perity of a navy, are points too manife&s;t to require a particular elucidation. They, by a kind of reaction, mutually beneficial, promote each other.</P>
<P>An unre&s;trained intercour&s;e between the &s;tates them|&s;elves will advance the trade of each, by an interchange of their re&s;pective productions, not only for the &s;upply of reciprocal wants at home, but for exportation to foreign markets. The veins of commerce in every
<PB N="68" REF="021127_0073_0FB23BDEC5B038F8">
part will be repleni&s;hed, and will acquire additional motion and vigour from a free circulation of the com|modities of every part. Commercial enterpri&s;e will have much greater &s;cope, from the diver&s;ity in the productions of different &s;tates. When the &s;taple of one fails, from a bad harve&s;t or unproductive crop, it can call to its aid the &s;taple of another. The variety not le&s;s than the value of products for exportation, contributes to the activity of foreign commerce. It can be conducted upon much better terms, with a large number of materials of a given value, than with a &s;mall number of materials of the &s;ame value; ari&s;ing from the competitions of trade and from the fluctua|tions of markets. Particular articles may be in great demand at certain periods, and un&s;aleable at others; but if there be a variety of articles, it can &s;carcely happen that they &s;hould all be at one time in the latter predicament; and on this account the operations of the merchant would be le&s;s liable to any con&s;iderable ob&s;truction or &s;tagnation. The &s;peculative trader will at once perceive the force of the&s;e ob&s;ervations; and will acknowledge, that the aggregate ballance of the commerce of the United States, would bid fair to be much more favourable than that of the Thirteen States, without union, or with partial unions.</P>
<P>It may perhaps be replied to this, that whether the &s;tates are united, or di&s;united, there would &s;till be an intimate intercour&s;e between them which would an&s;wer the &s;ame ends: But this intercour&s;e would be fettered, interrupted and narrowed by a multiplicity of cau&s;es; which in the cour&s;e of the&s;e papers have been amply detailed. An unity of commercial, as well as political intere&s;ts, can only re&s;ult from an unity of government.</P>
<P>There are other points of view, in which this &s;ubject might be placed, of a &s;triking and animating kind. But they would lead us too far into the regions of futurity, and would involve topics not proper for a new&s;paper di&s;cu&s;&s;ion. I &s;hall briefly ob&s;erve, that

our &s;ituation invites, and our intere&s;t prompts us, to aim at an a&s;cendant in the &s;y&s;tem of American affairs. The world may politically, as well as geographically, be divided into four parts, each having a di&s;tinct &s;et of intere&s;ts. Unhappily for the other three, Europe by her arms and by her negociations, by force and by fraud, has, in different degrees, extended her dominion over them all.

The &s;uperiority &s;he has long maintained, has tempted her to plume her&s;elf as the mi&s;tre&s;s of the world, and to con&s;ider the re&s;t of mankind as created for her benefit.

<HEAD>NUMBER XII. The Utility of the Union in re&s;pect to Revenue.</HEAD>
<P>THE effects of union, upon the commercial pro&s;perity of the &s;tates, have been &s;ufficiently delineated. Its tendency to promote the intere&s;ts of revenue will be the &s;ubject of our pre&s;ent enquiry.</P>
<P>The pro&s;perity of commerce is now perceived and acknowledged, by all enlightened &s;tate&s;men to be the mo&s;t u&s;eful as well as the mo&s;t productive &s;ource of national wealth; and has accordingly become a pri|mary object of their political cares. By multiplying the means of gratification, by promoting the intro|duction and circulation of the precious metals, tho&s;e darling objects of human avarice and enterpri&s;e, it &s;erves to vivify and invigorate all the channels of indu&s;try, and to make them flow with greater activity and copiou&s;ne&s;s. The a&s;&s;iduous merchant, the labo|rious hu&s;bandman, the active mechanic, and the indu&s;trious manufacturer, all orders of men look for|ward with eager expectation and growing alacrity to this plea&s;ing reward of their toils. The often-agitated que&s;tion between agriculture and commerce, has from indubitable experience received a deci&s;ion, which has &s;ilenced the rival&s;hips that once &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between them, and has proved, to the entire &s;atisfaction of their friends, that their intere&s;ts are intimately blended and interwoven. It has been found, in various countries, that in proportion as commerce has flouri&s;hed land has ri&s;en in value. And how could it have happened otherwi&s;e? Could that which procures a freer vent for the products of the earth&mdash;which furni&s;hes new incitements to the cultivators of land&mdash;which is the mo&s;t powerful in&s;trument in increa&s;ing the quantity of money in a &s;tate&mdash;could that, in fine, which is the faithful handmaid of labour and indu&s;try, in every &s;hape, fail to augment the value of that article, which
<PB N="71" REF="021127_0076_0FB23BE34568D788">
is the prolific parent of far the greate&s;t part of the objects, upon which they are exerted? It is a&s;toni&s;h|ing that &s;o &s;imple a truth &s;hould ever have had an adver&s;ary; and it is one, among a multitude of proofs, how apt a &s;pirit of ill informed jealou&s;y or of too great ab&s;traction and refinement is to lead men a&s;tray from the plaine&s;t paths of rea&s;on and conviction.</P>
<P>The ability of a country to pay taxes mu&s;t always be proportioned, in a great degree, to the quantity of money in circulation and to the celerity with which it circulates. Commerce, contributing to both th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e objects, mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity render the payment of taxes ea&s;ier, and facilitate the requi&s;ite &s;upplies to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rea|&s;ury. The hereditary dominions of the e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">peror of Germany contain a great extent of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ertile, cultivated and populous territory, a large proportion of which is &s;ituated in mild and luxuriant climates. In &s;ome parts of this territory are to be found, the be&s;t gold and &s;ilver mines in Europe. And yet, from the want of the fo&s;tering influence of commerce, that monarch can boa&s;t but &s;lender revenues. He has &s;everal times been compelled to owe obligations to the pecuniary &s;uccours of other nations, for the pre&s;ervation of his e&s;&s;ential intere&s;ts; and is unable, upon the &s;trength of his own re&s;ources, to &s;u&s;tain a long or continued war.</P>
<P>But it is not in this a&s;pect of the &s;ubject alone that union will be &s;een to conduce to the purpo&s;es of revenue. There are other points of view, in which its influence will appear more immediate and deci&s;ive. It is evident from the &s;tate of the country, from the habits of the people, from the experience we have had on the point it&s;elf, that it is impracticable to rai&s;e any very con&s;iderable &s;ums by direct taxation. Tax laws have in vain been multiplied&mdash;new methods to enforce the collection have in vain been tried&mdash;the public expectation has been uniformly di&s;appointed, and the trea&s;uries of the &s;tates have remained empty. The popular &s;y&s;tem of admini&s;tration, inherent in the nature of popular government, coinciding with the
<PB N="72" REF="021127_0077_0FB23BE4C5F91168">
real &s;carcity of money, incident to a languid and mutilated &s;tate of trade, has hitherto defeated every experiment for exten&s;ive collections, and has at length taught the different legi&s;latures the folly of attempt|ing them.</P>
<P>No per&s;on acquainted with what happens in other countries, will be &s;urpri&s;ed at this circum&s;tance. In &s;o opulent a nation as that of Britain, where direct taxes, from &s;uperior wealth, mu&s;t be much more toler|able, and, from the vigor of the government, much more practicable, than in America, far the greate&s;t part of the national revenue is derived from taxes of the indirect kind; from impo&s;ts and from exci&s;es. Duties on imported articles form a large branch of this latter de&s;cription.</P>
<P>In America, it is evident, that we mu&s;t a long time, depend for the means of revenue, chiefly on &s;uch duties. In mo&s;t parts of it, exci&s;es mu&s;t be con|fined within a narrow compa&s;s. The genius of the people will ill-brook the inqui&s;itive and peremptory &s;pirit of exci&s;e laws. The pockets of the farmers on the other hand will reluctantly yield but &s;canty &s;up|plies in the unwelcome &s;hape of impo&s;itions on their hou&s;es and lands&mdash;and per&s;onal property is too pre|carious and invi&s;ible a fund to be laid hold of in any other way, than by the imperceptible agency of taxes on con&s;umption.</P>
<P>If the&s;e remarks have any foundation, that &s;tate of things, which will be&s;t enable us to improve and extend &s;o valuable a re&s;ource, mu&s;t be the be&s;t adapted to our political welfare. And it cannot admit of a &s;erious doubt, that this &s;tate of things mu&s;t re&s;t on the ba&s;is of a general union. As far as this would be conducive to the intere&s;ts of commerce, &s;o far it mu&s;t tend to the exten&s;ion of the revenue to be drawn from that &s;ource. As far as it would contribute to render|ing regulations for the collection of the duties more &s;imple and efficacious, &s;o far it mu&s;t &s;erve to an&s;wer the purpo&s;es of making the &s;ame rate of duties more
<PB N="73" REF="021127_0078_0FB23BE645A23AF0">
productive, and of putting it into the power of the government to increa&s;e the rate, without prejudice to trade.</P>
<P>The relative &s;ituation of the&s;e &s;tates&mdash;the number of rivers with which they are inter&s;ected, and of bays that wa&s;h their &s;hores&mdash;the facility of communication in every direction&mdash;the affinity of language and manners&mdash;the familiar habits of intercour&s;e; all the&s;e are circum&s;tances that would con&s;pire to render an illicit trade between them a matter of little difficulty; and would in&s;ure frequent eva&s;ions of the commercial regulations of each other. The &s;eparate &s;tates, or confederacies, would be nece&s;&s;itated by mutual jealou&s;y to avoid the temptations to that kind of trade by the lowne&s;s of their duties. The temper of our govern|ments, for a long time to come, would not permit tho&s;e rigorous precautions, by which the European nations guard the avenues into their re&s;pective coun|tries, as well by land as by water, and which even there are found in&s;ufficient ob&s;tacles to the adven|turous &s;tratagems of avarice.</P>
<P>In France there is an army of patrols (as they are called) con&s;tantly employed to &s;ecure her fi&s;cal regu|lations again&s;t the inroads of the dealers in contra|band. Mr. Neckar computes the number of the&s;e patrols at upwards of twenty thou&s;and. This proves the immen&s;e difficulty in preventing that &s;pecies of traffic, where there is an inland communication, and &s;hews in a &s;trong light the di&s;advantages, with which the collection of duties in this country would be incum|bered, if by di&s;union the &s;tates &s;hould be placed in a &s;ituation with re&s;pect to each other, re&s;embling that of France with re&s;pect to her neighbours. The arbi|trary and vexatious powers with which the patrols are nece&s;&s;arily armed would be intolerable in a free country.</P>
<P>If on the contrary there be but one government, pervading all the States, there will be as to the prin|cipal part of our commerce but ONE SIDE to guard,
<PB N="74" REF="021127_0079_0FB23BE7C53275A8">
the ATLANTIC COAST. Ve&s;&s;els arriving directly from foreign countries, laden with valuable cargoes, would rarely choo&s;e to hazard them&s;elves to the com|plicated and critical perils, which would attend attempts to unlade prior to their coming into port. They would have to dread both the dangers of the coa&s;t, and of detection as well after as before their arrival at the places of their final de&s;tination. An ordinary degree of vigilance would be competent to the prevention of any material infractions upon the rights of the revenue. A few armed ve&s;&s;els, judiciou&s;ly &s;tationed at the entrances of our ports, might at &s;mall expence be made u&s;eful &s;entinels of the laws. And the government having the &s;ame intere&s;t to provide again&s;t violations every where, the co-operation of its mea&s;ures in each &s;tate would have a powerful tendency to render them effectual. Here al&s;o we &s;hould pre|&s;erve by union an advantage which nature holds out to us, and which would be relinqui&s;hed by &s;eparation. The United States lie at a great di&s;tance from Europe and at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance from all other places, with which they would have exten&s;ive connections of foreign trade. The pa&s;&s;age from them to us in a few hours, or in a &s;ingle night, as between the coa&s;ts of France and Britain and of other neighbouring nations would be impracticable. This is a prodi|gious &s;ecurity again&s;t a direct contraband with foreign countries; but a circuitous contraband to one &s;tate through the medium of another, would be both ea&s;y and &s;afe. The difference between a direct impor|tation from abroad and an indirect importation, through the channel of a neighbouring &s;tate, in &s;mall parcels, according to time and opportunity, with the additional facilities of inland communication, mu&s;t be palpable to every man of di&s;cernment.</P>
<P>It is, therefore, evident, that one national govern|ment would be able, at much le&s;s expence, to extend the duties on imports, beyond compari&s;on further, than would be practicable to the &s;tates &s;eparately, or
<PB N="75" REF="021127_0080_0FB23BE94539E400">
to any partial confederacies: Hitherto I believe it may &s;afely be a&s;&s;erted that the&s;e duties have not upon an average exceeded in any &s;tate three per cent. In France they are e&s;timated at about fifteen per cent, and in Britain the proportion is &s;till greater. There &s;eems to be nothing to hinder their being increa&s;ed in this country, to at lea&s;t treble their pre&s;ent amount. The &s;ingle article of ardent &s;pirits, under federal regulation, might be made to furni&s;h a con&s;iderable revenue. Upon a ratio to the importation into this &s;tate, the whole quantity imported into the United States may at a low computation be e&s;timated at four millions of gallons; which at a &s;hilling per gallon would produce two hundred thou&s;and pounds. That article would well bear this rate of duty; and if it &s;hould tend to dimini&s;h the con&s;umption of it, &s;uch an effect would be equally favorable to the agricul|ture, to the economy, to the morals and to the health of the &s;ociety. There is perhaps nothing &s;o much a &s;ubject of national extravagance, as this very article.</P>
<P>What will be the con&s;equence, if we are not able to avail our&s;elves of the re&s;ource in que&s;tion in its full extent? A nation cannot long exi&s;t without revenue. De&s;titute of this e&s;&s;ential &s;upport, it mu&s;t re&s;ign its independence, and &s;ink into the degraded condition of a province. This is an extremity to which no government will of choice accede. Revenue therefore mu&s;t be had at all events. In this country, if the principal part be not drawn from commerce, it mu&s;t fall with oppre&s;&s;ive weight upon land. It has been already intimated that exci&s;es, in their true &s;ignification, are too little in uni&s;on with the feelings of the people, to admit of great u&s;e being made of that mode of taxation: nor indeed, in the &s;tates where almo&s;t the &s;ole employment is agriculture, are the objects proper for exci&s;e &s;ufficiently numerous, to permit very ample collections in that way. Per&s;onal e&s;tate, (as has been before remarked) from the diffi|culty of tracting it, cannot be &s;ubjected to large con|tributions,
<PB N="76" REF="021127_0081_0FB23BEAC764DA50">
by any other means than by taxes on con|&s;umption. In populous cities, it may be enough the &s;ubject of conjecture, to occa&s;ion the oppre&s;&s;ion of individuals, without much aggregate benefit to the &s;tate; but beyond the&s;e circles it mu&s;t in a great mea|&s;ure e&s;cape the eye and the hand of the tax gatherer. As the nece&s;&s;ities of the &s;tate, neverthele&s;s, mu&s;t be &s;atisfied in &s;ome mode or other, the defect of other re&s;ources mu&s;t throw the principal weight of the public burthens on the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of land. And as on the other hand the wants of the government can never obtain an adequate &s;upply, unle&s;s all the &s;ources of revenue are open to its demands, the finances of the community, under &s;uch embarra&s;&s;ments, cannot be put into a &s;ituation con&s;i&s;tent with its re&s;pectability, or its &s;ecurity. Thus we &s;hall not even have the con|&s;olations of a full trea&s;ury to atone for the oppre&s;&s;ion of that valuable cla&s;s of the citizens, who are employed in the cultivation of the &s;oil. But public and private di&s;tre&s;s will keep pace with each other in gloomy con|cert; and unite in deploring the infatuation of tho&s;e councils, which led to di&s;union.</P>

<HEAD>NUMBER XIII. The &s;ame Subject continued, with a View to Economy.</HEAD>
<P>AS connected with the &s;ubject of revenue, we may with propriety con&s;ider that of economy. The money &s;aved from one object may be u&s;efully applied to another; and there will be &s;o much the le&s;s to be drawn from the pockets of the people. If the &s;tates are united under one government, there will be but one national civil li&s;t to &s;upport; if they are divided into &s;everal confederacies, there will be as many dif|ferent
<PB N="77" REF="021127_0082_0FB23BEC45185A10">
national civil li&s;ts to be provided for; and each of them, as to the principal departments coex|ten&s;ive with that which would be nece&s;&s;ary for a govern|ment of the whole. The entire &s;eparation of the &s;tates into thirteen unconnected &s;overeignties is a project too extravagant and too replete with danger to have many advocates. The ideas of men who &s;pe|culate upon the di&s;memberment of the empire, &s;eem generally turned towards three confederacies; one con&s;i&s;ting of the four Northern, another of the four middle, and a third of the five Southern &s;tates. There is little probability that there would be a greater num|ber. According to this di&s;tribution, each confede|racy would compri&s;e an extent of territory larger than that of the kingdom of Great-Britain. No well informed man will &s;uppo&s;e that the affairs of &s;uch a confederacy can be properly regulated by a govern|ment, le&s;s comprehen&s;ive in its organs or in&s;titutions, than that which has been propo&s;ed by the convention. When the dimen&s;ions of a &s;tate attain to a certain magnitude, it requires the &s;ame energy of govern|ment, and the &s;ame forms of admini&s;tration, which are requi&s;ite in one of much greater extent. This idea admits not of preci&s;e demon&s;tration, becau&s;e there is no rule by which we can mea&s;ure the momentum of civil power, nece&s;&s;ary to the government of any given number of individuals; but when we con&s;ider that the I&s;land of Britain, nearly commen&s;urate with each of the &s;uppo&s;ed confederacies, contains about eight millions of people, and when we reflect upon the degree of authority required to direct the pa&s;&s;ions of &s;o large a &s;ociety to the public good, we &s;hall &s;ee no rea&s;on to doubt that the like portion of power would be &s;ufficient to perform the &s;ame ta&s;k in a &s;ociety far more numerous. Civil power properly organi&s;ed and exerted is capable of diffu&s;ing its force to a very great extent; and can in a manner reproduce it&s;elf in every part of a great empire by a j<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">dicious arrangement of &s;ubordinate in&s;titutions.</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="021127_0083_0FB23BEDC4A489A0">The &s;uppo&s;ition, that each confederacy into which the &s;tates would be likely to be divided, would require a government not le&s;s comprehen&s;ive, than the one propo&s;ed, will be &s;trengthened by another &s;uppo&s;ition, more probable than that which pre&s;ents us with three confederacies as the alternative to a general union. If we attend carefully to geographical and commercial con&s;iderations, in conjunction with the habits and pre|judices of the different &s;tates, we &s;hall be led to con|clude, that in ca&s;e of di&s;union they will mo&s;t naturally league them&s;elves under two governments. The four Ea&s;tern &s;tates, from all the cau&s;es that form the links of national &s;ympathy and connection, may with cer|tainty be expected to unite. New-York, &s;ituated as &s;he is, would never be unwi&s;e enough to oppo&s;e a feeble and un&s;upported flank to the weight of that confe|deracy. There are obvious rea&s;ons, that would faci|litate her acce&s;&s;ion to it. New-Jer&s;ey is too &s;mall a &s;tate to think of being a frontier, in oppo&s;ition to this &s;till more powerful combination; nor do there appear to be any ob&s;tacles to her admi&s;&s;ion into it. Even Penn&s;ylvania would have &s;trong inducements to join the Northern league. An active foreign commerce on the ba&s;is of her own navigation is her true policy, and coincides with the opinions and di&s;po&s;itions of her citizens. The more Southern &s;tates, from various circum&s;tances, may not think them&s;elves much inte|re&s;ted in the encouragement of navigation. They may prefer a &s;y&s;tem, which would give unlimited &s;cope to all nations, to be the carriers as well as the purcha&s;ers of their commodities. Penn&s;ylvania may not choo&s;e to confound her intere&s;ts in a connection &s;o adver&s;e to her policy. As &s;he mu&s;t at all events be a frontier, &s;he may deem it mo&s;t con&s;i&s;tent with her &s;afety to have her expo&s;ed &s;ide turned towards the weaker power of the Southern, rather than towards the &s;tronger power of the Northern confederacy. This would give her the faire&s;t chance to a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oid being the FLANDERS of America. Whatever may be the

<HEAD>NUMBER XIV. An Objection drawn from the Extent of Coun|try an&s;wered.</HEAD>
<P>WE have &s;een the nece&s;&s;ity of the union as our bulwark again&s;t foreign danger, as the con|&s;ervator of peace among our&s;elves, as the guardian of our commerce and other common intere&s;ts, as the only &s;ub&s;titute for tho&s;e military e&s;tabli&s;hments which
<PB N="80" REF="021127_0085_0FB23BF0E6782CD0">
have &s;ubverted the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">berties of the old world, and as the proper antidote for the di&s;ea&s;es of faction, which have proved fatal to other popular governments, and of which alarming &s;ymptoms have been betrayed by our own. All that remains, within this branch of our enquiries, is to take notice of an objection, that may be drawn from the great extent of country which the union embraces. A few ob&s;ervations on this &s;ubject will be the more proper, as it is perceived that the adver&s;aries of the new con&s;titution are availing them|&s;elves of a prevailing prejudice, with regard to the practicable &s;phere of republican admini&s;tration, in order to &s;upply by imaginary difficulties, the want of tho&s;e &s;olid objections, which they endeavour in vain to find.</P>
<P>The error which limits republican government to a narrow di&s;trict, has been unfolded and refuted in preceding papers. I remark here only, that it &s;eems to owe its ri&s;e and prevalence chiefly to the confound|ing of a republic with a democracy: And applying to the former rea&s;onings drawn from the nature of the latter. The true di&s;tinction between the&s;e forms was al&s;o adverted to on a former occa&s;ion. It is, that in a democracy, the people meet and exerci&s;e the govern|ment in per&s;on; in a republic they a&s;&s;emble and admi|ni&s;ter it by their repre&s;entatives and agents. A demo|cracy con&s;equently mu&s;t be confined to a &s;mall &s;pot. A republic may be extended over a large region.</P>
<P>To this accidental &s;ource of the error may be added, the artifice of &s;ome celebrated authors, who&s;e writings have had a great &s;hare in forming the modern &s;tan|dard of political opinions. Being &s;ubjects either of an ab&s;olute, or limited monarchy, they have endea|voured to heighten the advantages or palliate the evils of tho&s;e forms; by placing in compari&s;on with them, the vices and defects of the republican, and by citing as &s;pecimens of the latter, the turbulent democracies of ancient Greece, and modern Italy. Under the confu&s;ion of names, it has been an ea&s;y ta&s;k to transfer
<PB N="81" REF="021127_0086_0FB23BF247E8DF30">
to a republic, ob&s;ervations applicable to a democracy only, and among others, the ob&s;ervation that it can never be e&s;tabli&s;hed but among a &s;mall number of people, living within a &s;mall compa&s;s of territory.</P>
<P>Such a fallacy may have been the le&s;s perceived, as mo&s;t of the popular governments of antiquity were of the democratic &s;pecies; and even in modern Europe, to which we owe the great principle of repre&s;entation, no example is &s;een of a government wholly popular, and founded at the &s;ame time wholly on that prin|ciple. If Europe has the merit of di&s;covering this great mechanical power in government, by the &s;imple agency of which, the will of the large&s;t political body may be concentred, and its force directed to any object, which the public good requires: America can claim the merit of making the di&s;covery the ba&s;is of unmixed and exten&s;ive republics. It is only to be lamented, that any of her citizens &s;hould wi&s;h to deprive her of the additional merit of di&s;playing its full efficacy in the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the comprehen&s;ive &s;y&s;tem now under her con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>As the natural limit of a democracy is that di&s;tance from the central point, which will ju&s;t permit the mo&s;t remote citizens to a&s;&s;emble as often as their public functions demand; and will include no greater number than can join in tho&s;e functions; &s;o the natural limit of a republic is that di&s;tance from the centre, which will barely allow the repre&s;entatives of the people to meet as often as may be nece&s;&s;ary for the admini|&s;tration of public affairs. Can it be &s;aid, that the limits of the United States exceed this di&s;tance? It will not be &s;aid by tho&s;e who recollect that the Atlantic coa&s;t is the longe&s;t &s;ide of the union; that during the term of thirteen years, the repre&s;entatives of the &s;tates have been almo&s;t continually a&s;&s;embled; and that the members from the mo&s;t di&s;tant &s;tates are not chargeable with greater intermi&s;&s;ions of attendance, than tho&s;e from the &s;tates in the neighbourhod of Congre&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="021127_0087_0FB23BF3C52569D0">That we may form a ju&s;ter e&s;timate with regard to this intere&s;ting &s;ubject, let us re&s;ort to the actual dimen&s;ions of the union. The limits, as fixed by the treaty of peace are on the Ea&s;t the Atlantic, on the South the latitude of thirty one degrees, on the We&s;t the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi, and on the North an irregular line running in &s;ome in&s;tances beyond the forty-fifth degree, in others falling as low as the forty-&s;econd. The Southern &s;hore of lake Erie lies below that lati|tude. Computing the di&s;tance between the thirty-fir&s;t and forty-fifth degrees, it amounts to nine hundred and &s;eventy three common miles; computing it from thirty one to forty two degrees to &s;even hundred, &s;ixty four miles and an half. Taking the mean for the di&s;tance, the amount will be eight hundred, &s;ixty eigh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> miles and three fourths. The mean di&s;tance from the Atlantic to the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi, does not probably exceed &s;even hundred and fifty miles. On a compari&s;on o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> this extent, with that of &s;everal countries in Europe the practicability of rendering our &s;y&s;tem commen|&s;urate to it, appears to be demon&s;trable. It is not a great deal larger than Germany, where a diet, repre|&s;enting the whole empire is continual<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y a&s;&s;embled; or than Poland before the late di&s;memberment, where another national diet was the depo&s;itary of the &s;upreme power. Pa&s;&s;ing by France and Spain, we find that in Great Britain, inferior as it may be in &s;ize, the repre&s;entatives of the Northern extremity of the i&s;land, have as far to travel to the national council, as will be required of tho&s;e of the mo&s;t remote parts of the union.</P>
<P>Favourable as this view of the &s;ubject may be, &s;ome ob&s;ervations remain which will place it in a light &s;till more &s;atisfactory.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place it is to be remembered, that the general government is not to be charged with the whole power of making and admini&s;tering laws. Its juri&s;diction is limited to certain enumerated objects, which concern all the members of the republic, but
<PB N="83" REF="021127_0088_0FB23BF544E0BFB0">
which are not to be attained by the &s;eparate provi&s;ions of any. The &s;ubordinate governments which can extend their care to all tho&s;e other objects, which can be &s;eparately provided for, will retain their due autho|rity and activity. Were it propo&s;ed by the plan of the convention to aboli&s;h the governments of the particular &s;tates, its adver&s;aries would have &s;ome ground for their objection, though it would not be difficult to &s;how that if they were aboli&s;hed, the general government would be compelled by the prin|ciple of &s;elf pre&s;ervation, to rein&s;tate them in their proper juri&s;diction.</P>
<P>A &s;econd ob&s;ervation to be made is, that the imme|diate object of the federal con&s;titution is to &s;ecure the union of the Thirteen primitive States, which we know to be practicable; and to add to them &s;uch other &s;tates, as may ari&s;e in their own bo&s;oms, or in their neighbourhoods, which we cannot doubt to be equally practicable. The arrangements that may be nece&s;&s;ary for tho&s;e angles and fractions of our territory, which lie on our north-we&s;tern frontier, mu&s;t be left to tho&s;e whom further di&s;coveries and experience will render more equal to the ta&s;k.</P>
<P>Let it be remarked in the third place, that the intercour&s;e throughout the union will be daily facili|tated by new improvements. Roads will every where be &s;hortened, and kept in better order; accommoda|tions for travellers will be multiplied and meliorated; an interior navigation on our ea&s;tern &s;ide will be opened throughout, or nearly throughout the whole extent of the Thirteen States. The communication between the We&s;tern and Atlantic di&s;tricts, and between different parts of each, will be rendered more and more ea&s;y by tho&s;e numerous canals with which the beneficence of nature has inter&s;ected our country, and which art finds it &s;o little difficult to connect and complete.</P>
<P>A fourth and &s;till more important con&s;ideration is, that as almo&s;t every &s;tate will on one &s;ide or other be a frontier, and will thus find in a regard to its &s;afety,
<PB N="84" REF="021127_0089_0FB23BF75095AAA0">
an inducement to make &s;ome &s;acrifices for the &s;ake of the general protection; &s;o the &s;tates which lie at the greate&s;t di&s;tance from the heart of the union, and which of cour&s;e may partake lea&s;t of the ordinary circulation of its benefits, will be at the &s;ame time immediately contiguous to foreign nations, and will con&s;equently &s;tand on particular occa&s;ions, in greate&s;t need of its &s;trength and re&s;ources. It may be incon|venient for Georgia or the &s;tates forming our We&s;tern or North-Ea&s;tern borders, to &s;end their repre&s;entatives to the &s;eat of government, but they would find it more &s;o to &s;truggle alone again&s;t an invading enemy, or even to &s;upport alone the whole expence of tho&s;e pre|cautions, which may be dictated by the neighbourhood of continual danger. If they &s;hould derive le&s;s benefit therefore from the union in &s;ome re&s;pects, than the le&s;s di&s;tant &s;tates, they will derive greater benefit from it in other re&s;pects, and thus the proper equilibrium will be maintained throughout.</P>
<P>I &s;ubmit to you my fellow citizens, the&s;e con&s;ide|rations, in full confidence that the good &s;en&s;e which has &s;o often marked your deci&s;ions, will allow them their due weight and effect; and that you will never &s;uffer difficulties, however formidable in appearance or however fa&s;hionable the error on which they may be founded, to drive you into the gloomy and perilous &s;cenes into which the advocates for di&s;union would conduct you. Hearken not to the unnatural voice which tells you that the people of America, knit together as they are by &s;o many chords of affection, can no longer live together as members of the &s;ame family; can no longer continue the mutual guardians of their mutual happine&s;s; can no longer be fellow citizens of one great re&s;pectable and flouri&s;hing empire. Hearken not to the voice which petulantly tells you that the form of government recommended for your adoption is a novelty in the political world; that it has never yet had a place in the theories of the wilde&s;t projectors; that it ra&s;hly attempts what it
<PB N="85" REF="021127_0090_0FB23BF84B0B87A8">
is impo&s;&s;ible to accompli&s;h. No my countrymen, &s;hut your ears again&s;t this unhallowed language. Shut your hearts again&s;t the poi&s;on which it conveys; the kindred blood which flows in the veins of American citizens, the mingled blood which they have &s;hed in defence of their &s;acred rights, con&s;ecrate their union, and excite horror at the idea of their becoming aliens, rivals, enemies. And if novelties are to be &s;hunned, believe me the mo&s;t alarming of all novelties, the mo&s;t wild of all projects, the mo&s;t ra&s;h of all attempts, is that of rending us in pieces, in order to pre&s;erve our liberties and promote our happine&s;s. But why is the experiment of an extended republic to be rejected merely becau&s;e it may compri&s;e what is new? Is it not the glory of the people of America, that whil&s;t they have paid a decent regard to the opinions of former times and other nations, they have not &s;uffered a blind veneration for antiquity, for cu&s;tom, or for names, to overrule the &s;ugge&s;tions of their own good &s;en&s;e, the knowledge of their own &s;ituation, and the le&s;&s;ons of their own experience? To this manly &s;pirit, po&s;terity will be indebted for the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and the world for the example of the numerous innovations di&s;played on the American theatre, in favour of pri|vate rights and public happine&s;s. Had no important &s;tep been taken by the leaders of the revolution for which a precedent could not be di&s;covered, no govern|ment e&s;tabli&s;hed of which an exact model did not pre&s;ent it&s;elf, the people of the United States might, at this moment, have been numbered among the melancholy victims of mi&s;guided councils, mu&s;t at be&s;t have been labouring under the weight of &s;ome of tho&s;e forms which have cru&s;hed the liberties of the re&s;t of mankind. Happily for America, happily we tru&s;t for the whole human race, they pur&s;ued a new and more noble cour&s;e. They accompli&s;hed a revolution which has no parallel in the annals of human &s;ociety: They reared the fabrics of governments which have no model on the face of the globe. They formed the

de&s;ign of a great confederacy, which it is incumbent on their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors to improve and perpetuate. If their works betray imperfections, we wonder at the fewne&s;s of them. If they erred mo&s;t in the &s;tructure of the union, this was the work mo&s;t difficult to be executed, this is the work which has been new modelled by the act of your convention, and it is that act on which you are now to deliberate and to decide.</P>

<P>IN the cour&s;e of the preceding papers, I have endea|voured, my fellow citizens, to place before you, in a clear and convincing light, the importance of union to your political &s;afety and happine&s;s. I have unfolded to you a complication of dangers to which you would be expo&s;ed &s;hould you permit that &s;acred knot, which binds the people of America together, to be &s;evered or di&s;&s;olved by ambition or by avarice, by jealou&s;y or by mi&s;repre&s;entation. In the &s;equel of the inquiry, through which I propo&s;e to accompany you, the truths intended to be inculcated will receive further confirmation from facts and arguments hitherto unnoticed. If the road, over which you will &s;till have to pa&s;s, &s;hould in &s;ome places appear to you tedious or irk&s;ome, you will recollect, that you are in que&s;t of information on a &s;ubject the mo&s;t momentous, which can engage the attention of a free people: That the field through which you have to travel is in it&s;elf

&s;pacious, and that the difficulties of the journey have been unnece&s;&s;arily increa&s;ed by the mazes with which &s;ophi&s;try has be&s;et the way. It will be my aim to remove the ob&s;tacles to your progre&s;s in as compen|dious a manner, as it can be done, without &s;acrificing utility to di&s;patch.</P>
<P>In pur&s;uance of the plan, which I have laid down, for the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the &s;ubject, the point next in order to be examined is the
<Q>in&s;ufficiency of the pre&s;ent confederation to the pre&s;ervation of the union.</Q>
It may perhaps be a&s;ked, what need is there of rea&s;oning or proof to illu&s;trate a po&s;ition, which is neither controverted nor doubted; to which the under&s;tandings and feelings of all cla&s;&s;es of men a&s;&s;ent; and which in &s;ub&s;tance is admitted by the opponents as well as by the friends of the new con|&s;titution?&mdash;It mu&s;t in truth be acknowledged that however the&s;e may differ in other re&s;pects, they in general appear to harmoni&s;e in this &s;entiment at lea&s;t, that there are mater<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">al imperfections in our national &s;y&s;tem, and that &s;omething is nece&s;&s;ary to be done to re&s;cue us from impending anarchy. The facts that &s;upport this opinion are no longer objects of &s;pecu|lation. They have forced them&s;elves upon the &s;en&s;ibi|lity of the people at large, and have at length extorted from tho&s;e, who&s;e mi&s;taken policy has had the prin|cipal &s;hare in precipitating the extremity, at which we are arrived, a reluctant confe&s;&s;ion of the reality of many of tho&s;e defects in the &s;cheme of our federal government, which have been long pointed out and regretted by the intelligent friends of the union.</P>
<P>We may indeed with propriety be &s;aid to have reached almo&s;t the la&s;t &s;tage of national humiliation. There is &s;carcely any thing that can wound the pride, or degrade the character of an independent nation, which we do not experience. Are there engagements to the performance of which we are held by every tie re&s;pectable among men? The&s;e are the &s;ubjects of con&s;tant and unblu&s;hing violation. Do we owe debts

The&s;e remain without any proper or &s;atisfactory provi&s;ion for their di&s;charge. Have we valuable territories and important po&s;ts in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a foreign power, which by expre&s;s &s;tipulations ought long &s;ince to have been &s;urrendered?

Is re&s;pectability in the eyes of foreign powers a &s;afeguard again&s;t foreign encroachments? The imbecillity of our government even forbids them to treat with us: Our amba&s;&s;adors abroad are the mere pageants of mimic &s;overeignty. Is a violent and unna|tural decrea&s;e in the value of land a &s;ymptom of national di&s;tre&s;s? The price of improved land in mo&s;t parts of the country is much lower than can be accounted for by the quantity of wa&s;te land at market, and can only be fully explained by that want of private and public confidence, which are &s;o alarmingly pre|valent among all ranks and which have a direct tendency to depreciate property of every kind. Is private credit the friend and patron of indu&s;try? That mo&s;t u&s;eful kind which relates to borrowing and lending is reduced within the narrowe&s;t limits, and this &s;till more from an opinion of in&s;ecurity than from a &s;carcity of money. To &s;horten an enumeration

of particulars which can afford neither plea&s;ure nor in&s;truction it may in general be demanded, what indication is there of national di&s;order, poverty and in&s;ignificance that could befal a community &s;o pecu|liarly ble&s;&s;ed with natural advantages as we are, which does not form a part of the dark catalogue of our public misfortunes?</P>
<P>This is the melancholy &s;ituation to which we have been brought by tho&s;e very maxims and councils, which would now deter us from adopting the propo&s;ed con&s;titution; and which not content with having con|ducted us to the brink of a precipice, &s;eem re&s;olved to plunge us into the aby&s;s, that awaits us below. Here, my countrymen, impelled by every motive that ought to influence an enlightened people, let us make a firm &s;tand for our &s;afety, our tranquility, our dignity, our reputation. Let us at la&s;t break the fatal charm which has too long &s;educed us from the paths of felicity and pro&s;perity.</P>
<P>It is true, as has been before ob&s;erved, that facts too &s;tubborn to be re&s;i&s;ted have produced a &s;pecies of general a&s;&s;ent to the ab&s;tract propo&s;ition that there exi&s;t material defects in our national &s;y&s;tem; but the u&s;efulne&s;s of the conce&s;&s;ion, on the part of the old adver&s;aries of federal mea&s;ures, is de&s;troyed by a &s;trenous oppo&s;ition to a remedy, upon the only prin|ciples, that can give it a chance of &s;ucce&s;s. While they admit that the government of the United States is de&s;titute of energy, they contend again&s;t conferring upon it tho&s;e powers which are requi&s;ite to &s;upply that energy: They &s;eem &s;till to aim at things repugnant and irreconcilable&mdash;at an augmentation of federal authority without a dimunition of &s;tate authority&mdash;at &s;overeignty in the union and complete independence in the members, They &s;till, in fine, &s;eem to cheri&s;h with blind devotion the political mon&s;ter of an <HI>impe|rium in imperio.</HI> This renders a full di&s;play of the prin|cipal defects of the confederation nece&s;&s;ary, in order to &s;hew, that the evils we experience do not proceed
<PB N="90" REF="021127_0095_0FB23C009CDE07A8">
from minute or partial imperfections, but from funda|mental errors in the &s;tructure of the building which cannot be amended otherwi&s;e than by an alteration in the fir&s;t principles and main pillars of the fabric.</P>
<P>The great and radical vice in the con&s;truction of the exi&s;ting confederation is in the principle of LEGIS|LATION for STATES or GOVERNMENTS, in their CORPORATE or COLLECTIVE CAPACITIES, and as contradi&s;tingui&s;hed from the INDIVIDUALS of whom they con&s;i&s;t. Though this principle does not run through all the powers delegated to the union; yet it pervades and governs tho&s;e on which the efficacy of the re&s;t depends. Except as to the rule of appor|tionment, the United States have an indefinite di&s;cre|tion to make requi&s;itions for men and money; but they have no authority to rai&s;e either by regulations extending to the individual citizens of America. The con&s;equence of this is, that though in theory their re&s;olutions concerning tho&s;e objects are laws, con&s;ti|tutionally binding on the members of the union, yet in practice they are mere recommendations, which the &s;tates ob&s;erve or di&s;regard at their option.</P>
<P>It is a &s;ingular in&s;tance of the capriciou&s;ne&s;s of the human mind, that after all the admonitions we have had from experience on this head, there &s;hould &s;till be found men, who object to the new con&s;titution for deviating from a principle which has been found the bane of the old; and which is in it&s;elf evidently incom|patible with the idea of GOVERNMENT; a principle in &s;hort which, if it is to be executed at all, mu&s;t &s;ub&s;titute the violent and &s;anguinary agency of the &s;word to the mild influence of the magi&s;tracy.</P>
<P>There is nothing ab&s;urd or impracticable in the idea of a league or alliance between independent nations, for certain defined purpo&s;es preci&s;ely &s;tated in a treaty; regulating all the details of time, place, circum&s;tance and quantity; leaving nothing to future di&s;cretion; and depending for its execution on the good faith of the parties. Compacts of this kind

exi&s;t among all civilized nations &s;ubject to the u&s;ual vici&s;&s;itudes of peace and war, of ob&s;ervance and non-ob&s;ervance, as the intere&s;ts or pa&s;&s;ions of the contract|ing powers dictate. In the early part of the pre&s;ent century, there was an epidemical rage in Europe for this &s;pecies of compacts; from which the politicians of the times fondly hoped for benefits which were never realized. With a view to e&s;tabli&s;hing the equi|librium of power and the peace of that part of the world, all the re&s;ources of negotiation were exhau&s;ted, and triple and quadruple alliances were formed; but they were &s;carcely formed before they were broken, giving an in&s;tructive but afflicting le&s;&s;on to mankind, how little dependence is to be placed on treaties which have no other &s;anction than the obligations of good faith, and which oppo&s;e general con&s;iderations of peace and ju&s;tice to the impul&s;e of any immediate intere&s;t or pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>If the particular &s;tates in this country are di&s;po&s;ed to &s;tand in a &s;imilar relation to each other, and to drop the project of a general DISCRETIONARY SUPERINTENDENCE, the &s;cheme would indeed be pernicious, and would entail upon us all the mi&s;chiefs which have been enumerated under the fir&s;t head; but it would have the merit of being at lea&s;t con&s;i&s;tent and practicable. Abandoning all views towards a confederate government, this would bring us to a &s;imple alliance offen&s;ive and defen&s;ive; and would place us in a &s;ituation to be alternately friends and enemies of each other, as our mutual jealou&s;ies and rival&s;hips nouri&s;hed by the intrigues of foreign nations &s;hould pre&s;cribe to us.</P>
<P>But if we are unwilling to be placed in this perilous &s;ituation; if we will &s;till adhere to the de&s;ign of a national government, or which is the &s;ame thing of a &s;uperintending power under the direction of a com|mon council, we mu&s;t re&s;olve to incorporate into our plan tho&s;e ingredients which may be con&s;idered as forming the characteri&s;tic difference between a league
<PB N="92" REF="021127_0097_0FB23C0389643490">
and a government; we mu&s;t extend the authority of the union to the per&s;ons of the citizens&mdash;the only proper objects of government.</P>
<P>Government implies the power of making laws. It is e&s;&s;ential to the idea of a law, that it be attended with a &s;anction; or, in other words, a penalty or puni&s;hment for di&s;obedience. If there be no penalty annexed to di&s;obedience, the re&s;olutions or commands which pretend to be laws, will in fact amount to nothing more than advice or recommendation. This penalty, whatever it may be, can only be inflicted in two ways; by the agency of the courts and mini&s;ters of ju&s;tice, or by military force; by the COERTION of the magi&s;tracy, or by the COERTION of arms. The fir&s;t kind can evidently apply only to men&mdash;the la&s;t kind mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity be employed again&s;t bodies politic, or communities or &s;tates. It is evident, that there is no proce&s;s of a court by which their ob&s;erv|ance of the laws can in the la&s;t re&s;ort be enforced. Sentences may be denounced again&s;t them for viola|tions of their duty; but the&s;e &s;entences can only be carried into execution by the &s;word. In an a&s;&s;ocia|tion where the general authority is confined to the collective bodies of the communities that compo&s;e it, every breach of the laws mu&s;t involve a &s;tate of war, and military execution mu&s;t become the only in&s;tru|ment of civil obedience. Such a &s;tate of things can certainly not de&s;erve the name of government, nor would any prudent man choo&s;e to commit his hap|pine&s;s to it.</P>
<P>There was a time when we were told that breaches, by the &s;tates, of the regulations of the federal autho|rity were not to be expected&mdash;that a &s;en&s;e of common intere&s;t would pre&s;ide over the conduct of the re&s;pec|tive members, and would beget a full compliance with all the con&s;titutional requi&s;itions of the union. This language at the pre&s;ent day would appear as wild as a great part of what we now hear from the &s;ame quarter will be thought, when we &s;hall have
<PB N="93" REF="021127_0098_0FB23C050D3178D0">
received further le&s;&s;ons from that be&s;t oracle of wi&s;dom, experience. It at all times betrayed an igno|rance of the true &s;prings by which human conduct is actuated, and belied the original inducements to the e&s;tabli&s;hment of civil power. Why has govern|ment been in&s;tituted at all? Becau&s;e the pa&s;&s;ions of men will not conform to the dictates of rea&s;on and ju&s;tice, without con&s;traint. Has it been found that bodies of men act with more rectitude or greater di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s than individuals? The contrary of this has been inferred by all accurate ob&s;ervers of the conduct of mankind; and the inference is founded upon obvious rea&s;ons. Regard to reputation has a le&s;s active influence, when the infamy of a bad action is to be divided among a number, than when it is to fall &s;ingly upon one. A &s;pirit of faction which is apt to mingle its poi&s;on in the deliberations of all bodies of men, w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ll often hurry the per&s;ons of whom they are compo&s;ed into improprieties and exce&s;&s;es, for which they would blu&s;h in a private capacity.</P>
<P>In addition to all this, there is in the nature of &s;overeign power an impatience of controul, which di&s;|po&s;es tho&s;e who are inve&s;ted with the ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rci&s;e of it, to look with an evil eye upon all external attempts to re&s;train or direct its operations. From this &s;pirit it happens, that in every political a&s;&s;ociation which is formed upon the principle of uniting in a common intere&s;t a number of le&s;&s;er &s;overeignties, there will be found a kind of excentric tendency in the &s;ubordinate or inferior orbs, by the operation of which there will be a perpetual effort in each to fly off from the common centre. This tendency is not difficult to be accounted for. It has its origin in the love of power. Power controuled or abridged is almo&s;t always the rival and enemy of that power by which it is controuled or abridged. This &s;imple propo&s;ition will teach us how little rea&s;on there is to expect, that the per&s;ons, entru&s;ted with the admini&s;tration of the affairs of the particular members of a confederacy, will at all times
<PB N="94" REF="021127_0099_0FB2458686B4B0A8">
be ready, with perfect good humour and an unbia&s;&s;ed regard to the public weal, to execute the re&s;olutions or decrees of the general authority. The rever&s;e of this re&s;ults from the con&s;titution of man.</P>
<P>If therefore the mea&s;ures of the confederacy cannot be executed, without the intervention of the parti|cular admini&s;trations, there will be little pro&s;pect of their being executed at all. The rulers of the re&s;pec|tive members, whether they have a con&s;titutional right to do it or not, will undertake to judge of the pro|priety of the mea&s;ures them&s;elves. They will con&s;ider the conformity of the thing propo&s;ed or required to their immediate intere&s;ts or aims; the momentary conveniences or inconveniences that would attend its adoption. All this will be done; and in a &s;pirit of intere&s;ted and &s;u&s;picious &s;crutiny, without that know|ledge of national circum&s;tances and rea&s;ons of &s;tate, which is e&s;&s;ential to a right judgment, and with that &s;trong predilection in favor of local objects, which can hardly fail to mi&s;lead the deci&s;ion. The &s;ame proce&s;s mu&s;t be repeated in every member of which the body is con&s;tituted; and the execution of the plans, framed by the councils of the whole, will always fluctuate on the di&s;cretion of the ill-informed and prejudiced opinion of every part. Tho&s;e who have been conver&s;ant in the proceedings of popular a&s;&s;emblies; who have &s;een how difficult it often is, when there is no exterior pre&s;&s;ure of circum&s;tances, to bring them to harmonious re&s;olutions on important points, will readily conceive how impo&s;&s;ible it mu&s;t be to induce a number of &s;uch a&s;&s;emblies, delibe|rating at a di&s;tance from each other, at different times, and under different impre&s;&s;ions, long to co|operate in the &s;ame views and pur&s;uits.</P>
<P>In our ca&s;e, the concurrence of thirteen di&s;tinct &s;overeign wills is requi&s;ite under the confedera|tion to the complete execution of every important mea&s;ure, that proceeds from the union. It has happened as was to have been fore&s;een. The mea|&s;ures
<PB N="95" REF="021127_0100_0FB24590E972CF30">
of the union have not been executed; and the delinquencies of the &s;tates have &s;tep by &s;tep matured them&s;elves to an extreme; which has at length arre&s;ted all the wheels of the national government, and brought them to an awful &s;tand. Congre&s;s at this time &s;carcely po&s;&s;e&s;s the means of keeping up the forms of admini&s;tration; till the &s;tates can have time to agree upon a more &s;ub&s;tantial &s;ub&s;titute for the pre&s;ent &s;hadow of a federal government. Things did not come to this de&s;perate extremity at once. The cau&s;es which have been &s;pecified produced at fir&s;t only unequal and di&s;proportionate degrees of compliance with the requi&s;itions of the union. The greater deficiencies of &s;ome &s;tates furni&s;hed the pretext of example and the temptation of intere&s;t to the com|plying, or to the lea&s;t delinquent &s;tates. Why &s;hould we do more in proportion than tho&s;e who are embarked with us in the &s;ame political voyage? Why &s;hould we con&s;ent to bear more than our proper &s;hare of the common burthen? The&s;e were &s;ugge&s;tions which human &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s could not with&s;tand, and which even &s;peculative men, who looked forward to remote con&s;equences, could not without he&s;itation combat. Each &s;tate yielding to the per&s;ua&s;ive voice of imme|diate intere&s;t or convenience has &s;ucce&s;&s;ively with|drawn its &s;upport, till the frail and tottering edifice &s;eems ready to fall upon our heads and to cru&s;h us beneath its ruins.</P>

<HEAD>NUMBER XVI. The &s;ame Subject continued, in Relation to the &s;ame Principles.</HEAD>
<P>THE tendency of the principle of legi&s;lation for &s;tates or communities, in their political capa|cities, as it has been exemplified by the experiment we have made of it, is equally atte&s;ted by the events
<PB N="96" REF="021127_0101_0FB245956754E4B8">
which have befallen all other governments of the con|federate kind, of which we have any account, in exact proportion to its prevalence in tho&s;e &s;y&s;tems. The confirmations of this fact will be worthy of a di&s;tinct and particular examination. I &s;hall content my&s;elf with barely ob&s;erving here, that of all the confede|racies of antiquity which hi&s;tory has handed down to us, the Lycian and Achaean leagues, as far as there remain ve&s;tiges of them, appear to have been mo&s;t free from the fetters of that mi&s;taken principle, and were accordingly tho&s;e which have be&s;t de&s;erved, and have mo&s;t liberally received the applauding &s;uffrages of political writers.</P>
<P>This exceptionable principle may as truly as empha|tically be &s;tiled the parent of anarchy: It has been &s;een that delinquencies in the members of the union are its natural and nece&s;&s;ary offspring; and that whenever they happen, the only con&s;titutional remedy is force, and the immediate effect of the u&s;e of it, civil war.</P>
<P>It remains to enquire how far &s;o odious an engine of government, in its application to us, would even be capable of an&s;wering its end. If there &s;hould not be a large army, con&s;tantly at the di&s;po&s;al of the national government, it would either not be able to employ force ot all, or when this could be done, it would amount to a war between different parts of the confederacy, concerning the infractions of a league; in which the &s;tronge&s;t combination would be mo&s;t likely to prevail, whether it con&s;i&s;ted of tho&s;e who &s;upported, or of tho&s;e who re&s;i&s;ted the general autho|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">&punc; It would rarely happen that the delinquency to be redre&s;&s;ed would be confined to a &s;ingle member, and if there were more than one, who had neglected their duty, &s;imilarity of &s;ituation would induce them to unite for common defence. Independent of this motive of &s;ympathy, if a large and influential &s;tate &s;hould happen to be the aggre&s;&s;ing member, it would commonly have weight enough with its neighbours, to win over &s;ome of them as a&s;&s;ociates to its cau&s;e.
<PB N="97" REF="021127_0102_0FB24598F0337E28">
Specious arguments of danger to the general liberty could ea&s;ily be contrived; plau&s;ible excu&s;es for the deficiencies of the party, could, without difficulty be invented, to alarm the apprehen&s;ions, inflame the pa&s;&s;ions, and conciliate the good will even of tho&s;e &s;tates which were not chargeable with any violation, or omi&s;&s;ion of duty. This would be the more likely to take place, as the delinquencies of the larger members might be expected &s;ometimes to proceed from an ambitious premeditation in their rulers, with a view to getting rid of all external controul upon their de&s;igns of per&s;onal agrandizement; the better to effect which, it is pre&s;umable they would tamper beforehand with leading individuals in the adjacent &s;tates. If a&s;&s;ociates could not be found at home, recour&s;e would be had to the aid of foreign powers, who would &s;eldom be di&s;inclined to encouraging the di&s;&s;entions of a confederacy, from the firm union of which they had &s;o much to fear. When the &s;word is once drawn, the pa&s;&s;ions of men ob&s;erve no bounds of moderation. The &s;ugge&s;tions of wounded pride, the in&s;tigations of irritated re&s;entment, would be apt to carry the &s;tates, again&s;t which the arms of the union were exerted, to any extremes nece&s;&s;ary to avenge the affront, or to avoid the di&s;grace of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. The fir&s;t war of this kind would probably terminate i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> a di&s;&s;olution of the union.</P>
<P>This may be con&s;idered as the violent death of the confederacy. Its more natural death is what we now &s;eem to be on the point of experiencing, if the federal &s;y&s;tem be not &s;peedily renovated in a more &s;ub&s;tantial form. It is not probable, con&s;idering the genius of this country, that the complying &s;tates would often be inclined to &s;upport the authority of the union by engaging in a war again&s;t the non-complying &s;tates. They would always be more ready to pur&s;ue the milder cour&s;e of putting them&s;elves upon an equal footing with the delinquent members, by an imitation of their example. And the guilt of all would thus
<PB N="98" REF="021127_0103_0FB2459A88B87BA0">
become the &s;ecurity of all. Our pa&s;t experience has exhibited the operation of this &s;pirit in its full light. There would in fact be an in&s;uperable difficulty in a&s;certaining when force could with propriety be employed. In the article of pecuniary contribution, which would be the mo&s;t u&s;ual &s;ource of delinquency, it would often be impo&s;&s;ible to decide whether it had proceeded from di&s;inclination, or inability. The pretence of the latter would always be at hand. And the ca&s;e mu&s;t be very f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">agrant in which its fallacy could be detected with &s;ufficient certainty to ju&s;tify the har&s;h expedient of compul&s;ion. It is ea&s;y to &s;ee that this problem alone, as often as it &s;hould occur, would open a wide field to the majority that happened to prevail in the national council, for the exerci&s;e of factious views, of partiality and of oppre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>It &s;eems to require no pains to prove that the &s;tates ought not to prefer a national con&s;titution, which could only be kept in motion by the in&s;trumentality of a large army, continually on foot to execute the ordinary requi&s;itions or decrees of the government. And yet this is the plain alternative involved by tho&s;e who wi&s;h to deny it the power of extending its opera|tions to individuals. Such a &s;cheme, if practicable at all, would in&s;tantly degenerate into a military de&s;poti&s;m; but it will be found in every light imprac|ticable. The re&s;ources of the union would not be equal to the maintenance of an army con&s;iderable enough to confine the larger &s;tates within the limits of their duty; nor would the means ever be furni&s;hed of forming &s;uch an army in the fir&s;t in&s;tance. Who|ever con&s;iders the populou&s;ne&s;s and &s;trength of &s;everal of the&s;e &s;tates &s;ingly at the pre&s;ent juncture, and looks forward to what they will become, even at the di&s;tance of half a century, will at once di&s;mi&s;s as idle and vi&s;i|onary any &s;cheme, which aims at regulating their movements by laws, to operate upon them in their collective capacities, and to be executed by a coertion applicable to them in the &s;ame capacities. A project
<PB N="99" REF="021127_0104_0FB2459CDDFFE6B0">
of this kind is little le&s;s romantic than the mon&s;ter-taming &s;pirit, attributed to the fabulous heroes and demi-gods of antiquity.</P>
<P>Even in tho&s;e confederacies, which have been compo&s;ed of members &s;maller than many of our counties, the principle of legi&s;lation for &s;overeign &s;tates, &s;upported by military coertion, has never been found effectual. It has rarely been attempted to be employed, but again&s;t the weaker members; and in mo&s;t in&s;tances attempts to coerce the refractory and di&s;obedient, have been the &s;ignals of bloody wars; in which one half of the confederacy has di&s;played its banners again&s;t the other half.</P>
<P>The re&s;ult of the&s;e ob&s;ervations to an intelligent mind mu&s;t be clearly this, that if it be po&s;&s;ible at any rate to con&s;truct a federal government capable of regulating the common concerns and pre&s;erving the general tranquillity, it mu&s;t be founded, as to the objects committed to its care, upon the rever&s;e of the principle contended for by the opponents of the pro|po&s;ed con&s;titution. It mu&s;t carry its agency to the per&s;ons of the citizens. It mu&s;t &s;tand in need of no intermediate legi&s;lations; but mu&s;t it&s;elf be impow|ered to employ the arm of the ordinary magi&s;trate to execute its own re&s;olutions. The maje&s;ty of the national authority mu&s;t be manife&s;ted through the medium of the courts of ju&s;tice. The government of the union, like that of each &s;tate, mu&s;t be able to addre&s;s it&s;elf immediately to the hopes and fears of individuals; and to attract to its &s;upport, tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ions, which have the &s;tronge&s;t influence upon the human heart. It mu&s;t in &s;hort, po&s;&s;e&s;s all the means and have a right to re&s;ort to all the methods of executing the powers, with which it is entru&s;ted, that are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed and exerci&s;ed by the governments of the particular &s;tates.</P>
<P>To this rea&s;oning it may perhaps be objected, that if any &s;tate &s;hould be di&s;&s;affected to the authority of the union, it could at any time ob&s;truct the execution
<PB N="100" REF="021127_0105_0FB245A1865ADC90">
of its laws, and bring the matter to the &s;ame i&s;&s;ue of force, with the nece&s;&s;ity of which the oppo&s;ite &s;cheme is reproached.</P>
<P>The plau&s;ibility of this objection will vani&s;h the moment we advert to the e&s;&s;ential difference between a mere NON COMPLIANCE and a DIRECT and ACTIVE RESISTANCE. If the interpo&s;ition of the &s;tate-legi&s;latures be nece&s;&s;ary to give effect to a mea&s;ure of the union, they have only NOT TO ACT, or TO ACT EVASIVELY, and the mea&s;ure is defeated. This neglect of duty may be di&s;gui&s;ed under affected but un&s;ub&s;tantial provi&s;ions, &s;o as not to appear, and of cour&s;e not to excite any alarm in the people for the &s;afety of the con&s;titution. The &s;tate-leaders may even make a merit of their &s;urreptitious inva&s;ions of it, on the ground of &s;ome temporary convenience, exemption or advantage.</P>
<P>But if the execution of the laws of the national government, &s;hould not require the intervention of the &s;tate-legi&s;latures; if they were to pa&s;s into imme|diate operation upon the citizens them&s;elves, the particular governments could not interrupt their progre&s;s without an open and violent exertion of an uncon&s;titutional power. No omi&s;&s;ions, nor eva&s;ions would an&s;wer the end. They would be obliged to act, and in &s;uch a manner, as would leave no doubt that they had encroached on the national rights. An experiment of this nature would always be hazardous in the face of a con&s;titution in any degree competent to its own defence, and of a people enlightened enough to di&s;tingui&s;h between a legal exerci&s;e and an illegal u&s;urpation of authority. The &s;ucce&s;s of it would re|quire not merely a factious majority in the legi&s;lature, but the concurrence of the courts of ju&s;tice, and of the body of the people. If the judges were not embarked in a con&s;piracy with the legi&s;lature, they would pro|nounce the re&s;olutions of &s;uch a majority to be con|trary to the &s;upreme law of the land, uncon&s;titutional and void. If the people were not tainted with the
<PB N="101" REF="021127_0106_0FB245A453F04750">
&s;pirit of their &s;tate repre&s;entatives, they, as the natu|ral guardians of the con&s;titution, would throw their weight into the national &s;cale, and give it a decided preponderancy in the conte&s;t. Attempts of this kind would not often be made with levity or ra&s;hne&s;s; becau&s;e they could &s;eldom be made without danger to the authors; unle&s;s in ca&s;es of a tyrannical exerci&s;e of the federal authority.</P>
<P>If oppo&s;ition to the national government &s;hould ari&s;e from the di&s;orderly conduct of refractory, or &s;editious individuals, it could be overcome by the &s;ame means which are daily employed again&s;t the &s;ame evil, under the &s;tate governments. The magi&s;tracy, being equally the mini&s;ters of the law of the land, from whatever &s;ource it might emanate, would doubt|le&s;s be as ready to guard the national as the local regulations from the inroads of private licentiou&s;ne&s;s. As to tho&s;e partial commotions and in&s;urrections which &s;ometimes di&s;quiet &s;ociety, from the intrigues of an incon&s;iderable faction, or from &s;udden or occa&s;ional ill humours that do not infect the great body of the community, the general government could command more exten&s;ive re&s;ources for the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of di&s;tur|bances of that kind, than would be in the power of any &s;ingle member. And as to tho&s;e mortal feuds, which in certain conjunctures &s;pread a conflagration through a whole nation, or through a very large pro|portion of it, proceeding either from weighty cau&s;es of di&s;content given by the government, or from the con|tagion of &s;ome violent popular paroxi&s;m, they do not fall within any ordinary rules of calculation. When they happen, they commonly amount to revolutions and di&s;memberments of empire. No form of govern|ment can always either avoid or controul them. It is in vain to hope to guard again&s;t events too mighty for human fore&s;ight or precaution; and it would be idle to object to a government becau&s;e it could not perform impo&s;&s;ibilities.</P>

<HEAD>NUMBER XVII. The Subject continued, and illu&s;trated by Examples to &s;how the Tendency of Federal Governments, rather to Anarchy among the Members than Tyranny in the Head.</HEAD>
<P>AN objection of a nature different from that which has been &s;tated and an&s;wered in my la&s;t addre&s;s, may perhaps be likewi&s;e urged again&s;t the principle of legi&s;lation for the individual citizens of America. It may be &s;aid, that it would tend to render the govern|ment of the union too powerful, and to enable it to ab&s;orb in it&s;elf tho&s;e re&s;iduary authorities, which it might be judged proper to leave with the &s;tates for local purpo&s;es. Allowing the utmo&s;t latitude to the love of power, which any rea&s;onable man can require, I confe&s;s I am at a lo&s;s to di&s;cover what temptation the per&s;ons entru&s;ted with the admini&s;tration of the general government could ever feel to dive&s;t the &s;tates of the authorities of that de&s;cription. The regula|tion of the mere dome&s;tic police of a &s;tate appears to me to hold out &s;lender allurements to ambition. Commerce, finance, negotiation and war &s;eem to comprehend all the objects, which have charms for minds governed by that pa&s;&s;ion; and all the powers nece&s;&s;ary to the&s;e objects ought in the fir&s;t in&s;tance to be lodged in the national depo&s;itary. The admi|ni&s;tration of private ju&s;tice between the citizens of the &s;ame &s;tate, the &s;upervi&s;ion of agriculture and of other concerns of a &s;imilar nature, all tho&s;e things in &s;hort which are proper to be provided for by local legi&s;lation, can never be de&s;ireable cares of a general juri&s;diction. It is therefore improbable that there &s;hould exi&s;t a di&s;po&s;ition in the federal councils to u&s;urp the powers with which they are connected;

becau&s;e the attempt to exerci&s;e tho&s;e powers would be as trouble&s;ome as it would be nugatory; and the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of them, for that rea&s;on, would contribute nothing to the dignity, to the importance, or to the &s;plendor of the national government.</P>
<P>But let it be admitted for argument &s;ake, that mere wantonne&s;s and lu&s;t of domination would be &s;ufficient to beget that di&s;po&s;ion, &s;till it may be &s;afely affirmed, that the &s;en&s;e of the con&s;tituent body of the national repre&s;entatives, or in other words of the people of the &s;everal States would controul the indulgence of &s;o extravagant an appetite. It will always be far more ea&s;y for the &s;tate governments to encroach upon the national authorities, than for the national government to encroach upon the &s;tate authorities. The proof of this propo&s;ition turns upon the greater degree of influence, which the &s;tate governments, if they admi|ni&s;ter their affairs with uprightne&s;s and prudence, will generally po&s;&s;e&s;s over the people; a circum&s;tance which at the &s;ame time teaches us, that there is an inherent and intrin&s;ic weakne&s;s in all federal con|&s;titutions; and that too much pains cannot be taken in their organization, to give them all the force which is compatible with the principles of liberty.</P>
<P>The &s;uperiority of influence in favour of the parti|cular governments would re&s;ult partly from the diffu&s;ive con&s;truction of the national government; but chiefly from the nature of the objects to which the attention of the &s;tate admini&s;trations would be directed.</P>
<P>It is a known fact in human nature that its affec|tions are commonly weak in proportion to the di&s;tance or diffu&s;ivne&s;s of the object. Upon the &s;ame principle that a man is more attached to his family than to his neighbourhood, to his neighbourhood than to the com|munity at large, the people of each &s;tate would be apt to feel a &s;tronger bya&s;s towards their local govern|ments than towards the government of the union; unle&s;s the force of that principle &s;hould be de&s;troyed by a much better admini&s;tration of the latter.</P>
<P><PB N="104" REF="021127_0109_0FB245ABE2F687F0">This &s;trong propen&s;ity of the human heart would find powerful auxiliaries in the objects of &s;tate regulation.</P>
<P>The variety of more minute intere&s;ts, which will nece&s;&s;arily fall under the &s;uperintendence of the local admini&s;trations, and which will form &s;o many rivulets of influence running through every part of the &s;ociety, cannot be particulari&s;ed without involving a detail too tedious and unintere&s;ting to compen&s;ate for the in&s;truction it might afford.</P>
<P>There is one tran&s;cendent advantage belonging to the province of the &s;tate governments which alone &s;uffices to place the matter in a clear and &s;atisfactory light&mdash;I mean the ordinary admini&s;tration of criminal and civil ju&s;tice. This of all others is the mo&s;t powerful, mo&s;t univer&s;al and mo&s;t attractive &s;ource of popular obedience and attachment. It is this, which&mdash;being the immediate and vi&s;ible guardian of life and pro|perty&mdash;having its benefits and its terrors in con&s;tant activity before the public eye&mdash;regulating all tho&s;e per&s;onal intere&s;ts and familiar concerns to which the &s;en&s;ibility of individuals is more immediately awake&mdash; contributes more than any other circum&s;tance to im|pre&s;&s;ing upon the minds of the people affection, e&s;teem and reverence towards the government. This great cement of &s;ociety which will diffu&s;e it&s;elf almo&s;t wholly through the channels of the particular govern|ments, independent of all other cau&s;es of influence, would en&s;ure them &s;o decided an empire over their re&s;pective citizens, as to render them at all times a complete counterpoi&s;e and not unfrequently dangerous rivals to the power of the union.</P>
<P>The operations of the national government on the other hand, falling le&s;s immediately under the ob&s;er|vation of the ma&s;s of the citizens, the benefits derived from it will chiefly be perceived and attended to by &s;peculative men. Relating to more general intere&s;ts, they will be le&s;s apt to come home to the feelings of the people; and, in proportion, le&s;s likely to in&s;pire
<PB N="105" REF="021127_0110_0FB245B1EDCF2088">
a habitual &s;en&s;e of obligation and an active &s;entiment of attachment.</P>
<P>The rea&s;oning on this head has been abundantly exemplified by the experience of all federal con&s;ti|tutions, with which we are acquainted, and of all others, which have borne the lea&s;t analogy to them.</P>
<P>Though the ancient feudal &s;y&s;tems were not &s;trictly &s;peaking confederacies, yet they partook of the nature of that &s;pecies of a&s;&s;ociation. There was a common head, chieftain, or &s;overeign, who&s;e authority exten|ded over the whole nation <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and a number of &s;ubor|dinate va&s;&s;als, or feudatories, who had large portions of land allotted to them and numerous trains of <HI>inferior</HI> va&s;&s;als or retainers, who occupied and culti|vated that land upon the tenure of fealty or obedience to the per&s;ons of whom they held it. Each principal va&s;&s;al was a kind of &s;overeign within his particular deme&s;nes. The con&s;equences of this &s;ituation were a continual oppo&s;ition to the authority of the &s;overeign, and frequent wars between the great barons, or chief feudatories them&s;elves. The power of the head of the nation was commonly too weak either to pre&s;erve the public peace or to protect the people again&s;t the oppre&s;&s;ions of their immediate lords. This period of European affairs is emphatically &s;tiled by hi&s;torians the times of feudal anarchy.</P>
<P>When the &s;overeign happened to be a man of vigorous and warlike temper and of &s;uperior abilities, he would acquire a per&s;onal weight and influence, which an&s;wered for the time the purpo&s;es of a more regular authority. But in general the power of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> barons triumphed over that of the prince; and in many in&s;tances his dominion was entirely thrown off, and the great fiefs were erected into independent principalities or &s;tates. In tho&s;e in&s;tances in which the monarch finally prevailed over his va&s;&s;als, his &s;ucce&s;s was chiefly owing to the tyranny of tho&s;e va&s;&s;als ove<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> their dependents.

of the common people were dreaded and dete&s;ted by both; till mutual danger and mutual intere&s;t effected an union between them fatal to the power of the ari&s;|tocracy. Had the nobles, by a conduct of clemency and ju&s;tice, pre&s;erved the fidelity and devotion of their retainers and followers, the conte&s;ts between them and the prince mu&s;t almo&s;t always have ended in their favor and in the abridgement or &s;ubver&s;ion of the royal authority.</P>
<P>This is not an a&s;&s;ertion founded merely in &s;pecu|lation or conjecture, Among other illu&s;trations of its truth which might be cited, Scotland will furni&s;h a cogent example. The &s;pirit of clan&s;hip which was at an early day introduced into that kingdom, uniting the nobles and their dependents by ties equivalent to tho&s;e of kindred, rendered the ari&s;tocracy a con&s;tant overmatch for the power of the monarch; till the incorporation with England &s;ubdued its fierce and ungovernable &s;pirit, and reduced it within tho&s;e rules of &s;ubordination, which a more rational and a more energetic &s;y&s;tem of civil polity had previou&s;ly e&s;ta|bli&s;hed in the latter kingdom.</P>
<P>The &s;eparate governments in a confederacy may aptly be compared with the feudal baronies; with this advantage in their favor, that from the rea&s;ons already explained, they will generally po&s;&s;e&s;s the confidence and good will of the people; and with &s;o important a &s;upport will be able effectually to oppo&s;e all incroachments of the national government.

<P>AMONG the confederacies of antiquity, the mo&s;t con&s;iderable was that of the Grecian republics a&s;&s;ociated under the Amphyctionic council. From the be&s;t accounts tran&s;mitted of this celebrated in&s;titution, it bore a very in&s;tructive analogy to the pre&s;ent con|federation of the American &s;tates.</P>
<P>The members retained the character of independent and &s;overeign &s;tates, and had equal votes in the federal council. This council had a general authority to pro|po&s;e and re&s;olve whatever it judged nece&s;&s;ary for the common welfare of Greece&mdash;to declare and carry on war&mdash;to decide in the la&s;t re&s;ort all controver&s;ies be|tween the members&mdash;to fine the aggre&s;&s;ing party&mdash; to employ the whole force of the confederacy again&s;t the di&s;obedient&mdash;to admit new members. The Am|phyctions were the guardians of religion, and of the immen&s;e riches belonging to the temple of Delphos, where they had the right of juri&s;diction in controver&s;ies between the inhabitants and tho&s;e who came to con&s;ult the oracle. As a further provi&s;ion for the efficacy of the federal powers, they took an oath mutually to defend and protect the united cities, to puni&s;h the violators of this oath, and to inflict vengeance on &s;acrilegious de&s;poilers of the temple.</P>
<P>In theory and upon paper, this apparatus of powers, &s;eems amply &s;ufficient for all general purpo&s;es. In
<PB N="108" REF="021127_0113_0FB245C227ACF798">
&s;everal material in&s;tances, they exceed the powers enumerated in the articles of confederation. The Amphyctions had in their hands the &s;uper&s;tition of the times, one of the principal engines by which government was then maintained; they had a de|clared authority to u&s;e coertion again&s;t refractory cities, and were bound by oath to exert this authority on the nece&s;&s;ary occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>Very different neverthele&s;s was the experiment from the theory. The powers, like tho&s;e of the pre|&s;ent congre&s;s, were admini&s;tered by deputies appointed wholly by the cities in their political capacities; and exerci&s;ed over them in the &s;ame capacities. Hence the weakne&s;s, the di&s;orders, and finally the de&s;truc|tion of the confederacy. The more powerful mem|bers, in&s;tead of being kept in awe and &s;ubordination, tyrannized &s;ucce&s;&s;ively over all the re&s;t. Athens, as we learn from Demo&s;thenes, was the arbiter of Greece &s;eventy three years. The Lacedemonians next go|verned it twenty nine years; at a &s;ub&s;equent period, after the battle of Leuctra, the Thebans had their turn of domination.</P>
<P>It happened but too often, according to Plutarch, that the deputies of the &s;tronge&s;t cities, awed and corrupted tho&s;e of the weaker, and that judgment went in favor of the mo&s;t powerful party.</P>
<P>Even in the mid&s;t of defen&s;ive and dangerous wars with Per&s;ia and Macedon, the members never acted in concert, and were more or fewer of them, eternally the dupes, or the hirelings of the common enemy. The intervals of foreign war, were filled up by dome&s;tic vici&s;&s;itudes, convul&s;ions and carnage.</P>
<P>After the conclu&s;ion of the war with Xerxes, it appears that the Lacedemonians, required that a number of the cities &s;hould be turned out of the confe|deracy for the unfaithful part they had acted. The Athenians finding that the Lacedemonians would lo&s;e fewer partizans by &s;uch a mea&s;ure than them&s;elves, and would become ma&s;ters of the public deliberations,
<PB N="109" REF="021127_0114_0FB245C30E2A3498">
vigorou&s;ly oppo&s;ed and defeated the attempt. This piece of hi&s;tory proves at once the inefficiency of the union; the ambition and jealou&s;y of its mo&s;t power|ful members, and the dependent and degraded con|dition of the re&s;t. The &s;maller members, though entitled by the theory of their &s;y&s;tem, to revolve in equal pride and maje&s;ty around the common center, had become in fact &s;atellites of the orbs of primary magnitude.</P>
<P>Had the Greeks, &s;ays the Abb&eacute; Milot, been as wi&s;e as they were courageous, they would have been admoni&s;hed by experience of the nece&s;&s;ity of a clo&s;er union, and would have availed them&s;elves of the peace which followed their &s;ucce&s;s again&s;t the Per&s;ian arms, to e&s;tabli&s;h &s;uch a reformation. In&s;tead of this obvious policy, Athens and Sparta, inflated with the victories and the glory they had acquired, became fir&s;t rivals, and then enemies; and did each other infinitely more mi&s;chief, than they had &s;uffered from Xerxes. Their mutual jealou&s;ies, fears, hatreds and injuries, ended in the celebrated Peloponne&s;ian war; which it&s;elf ended in the ruin and &s;lavery of the Athenians, who had begun it.</P>
<P>As a weak government, when not at war, is ever agitated by internal di&s;&s;entions; &s;o the&s;e never fail to bring on fre&s;h calamities from abroad. The Phocians having ploughed up &s;ome con&s;ecrated ground belong|ing to the temple of Apollo, the Amphyctionic council, according to the &s;uper&s;tition of the age, impo&s;ed a fine on the &s;acrilegious offenders. The Phocians, being abetted by Athens and Sparta, refu&s;ed to &s;ubmit to the decree. The Thebans, with others of the cities, undertook to maintain the authority of the Amphyc|tions, and to avenge the violated god. The latter being the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eaker party, invited the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Philip of Macedon, who had &s;ecretly fo&s;tered the conte&s;t. Philip gladly &s;eized the opportunity of executing the de&s;igns he had long planned again&s;t the liberties of Greece. By his intrigues and bribes he won over to
<PB N="110" REF="021127_0115_0FB245C464EB7E08">
his intere&s;ts the popular leaders of &s;everal cities; by their influence and votes, gained admi&s;&s;ion into the Amphyctionic council; and by his arts and his arms, made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of the confederacy.</P>
<P>Such were the con&s;equences of the fallacious prin|ciple, on which this intere&s;ting e&s;tabli&s;hment was founded. Had Greece, &s;ays a judicious ob&s;erver on her fate, been united by a &s;tricter confederation, and per&s;evered in her union, &s;he would never have worn the chains of Macedon; and might have proved a barrier to the va&s;t projects of Rome.</P>
<P>The Achaean league, as it is called, was another &s;ociety of Grecian republics, which &s;upplies us with valuable in&s;truction.</P>
<P>The union here was far more intimate, and its organization much wi&s;er, than in the preceding in&s;tance. It will accordingly appear, that though not exempt from a &s;imilar cata&s;trophe, it by no means equally de&s;erved it.</P>
<P>The cities compo&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ng this league, retained their municipal juri&s;diction, appointed their own officers, and enjoyed a perfect equality. The &s;enate in which they were repre&s;ented, had the &s;ole and exclu&s;ive right of peace and war&mdash;of &s;ending and receiving amba&s;&s;adors&mdash;of entering into treaties and alliances&mdash; of appointing a chief magi&s;trate or pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tor, as he was called, who commanded their armies; and who with the advice and con&s;ent of ten of the &s;enators, not only a&s;tmini&s;tered the government in the rece&s;s of the &s;enate, but had a great &s;hare in its deliberation, when a&s;&s;embled. According to the primitive con&s;titution, there were two pretors a&s;&s;ociated in the admini&s;tration, but on trial, a &s;ingle one was preferred.</P>
<P>It appears that the cities had all the &s;ame laws and cu&s;toms, the &s;ame weights and mea&s;ures, and the &s;ame money. But how far this effect proceeded from the authority of the federal council, is left in uncer|tainty. It is &s;aid only, that the cities were in a manner compelled to receive the &s;ame laws and
<PB N="111" REF="021127_0116_0FB245C608058EF0">
u&s;ages. When Lacedemon was brought into the league by Philopoemen, it was attended with an abolition of the in&s;titutions and laws of Lycurgus, and an adoption of tho&s;e of the Achaeans. The Amphyctionic confederacies, of which &s;he had been a member, left her in the full exerci&s;e of her govern|ment and her legi&s;lation. This circum&s;tance alone proves a very material difference in the genius of the two &s;y&s;tems.</P>
<P>It is much to be regretted that &s;uch imperfect monuments remain of this curious political fabric. Could its interior &s;tructure and regular operation be a&s;certained, it is probable that more light would be thrown by it on the &s;cience of federal government, than by any of the like experiments with which we are acquainted.</P>
<P>One important fact &s;eems to be witne&s;&s;ed by all the hi&s;torians who take notice of Achaean affairs. It is, that as well after the renovation of the league by Aratus, as before its di&s;&s;olution by the arts of Macedon, there was infinitely more of moderation and ju&s;tice in the admini&s;tration of its government, and le&s;s of violence and &s;edition in the people, than were to be found in any of the cities exerci&s;ing <HI>&s;ingly</HI> all the prerogatives of &s;overeignty. The abb&eacute; Mably in his ob&s;ervations on Greece, &s;ays that the popular government, which was &s;o tempe&s;tuous el&s;ewhere, cau&s;ed no di&s;orders in the members of the Achaean republic, <HI>becau&s;e it was there tempered by the general authority and laws of the confederacy.</HI></P>
<P>We are not to conclude too ha&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ly, however, that faction did not in a certain degree agitate the parti|cular cities; much le&s;s, that a due &s;ubordination and harmony reigned in the general &s;y&s;tem. The contrary is &s;ufficiently di&s;p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ayed in the vici&s;&s;itudes and fate of the republic.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t the Amphyctionic confederacy remained, that of the Achaeans, which comprehended the le&s;s important cities only, made little figure on the theatre
<PB N="112" REF="021127_0117_0FB245CC1D3FC718">
of Greece. When the former became a victim to Macedon, the latter was &s;pared by the policy of Philip and Alexander. Under the &s;ucce&s;&s;ors of the&s;e princes, however, a different policy prevailed. The arts of divi&s;ion were practi&s;ed among the Achaeans; each city was &s;educed into a &s;eparate intere&s;t; the union was di&s;&s;olved. Some of the cities fell under the tyranny of Macedonian garri&s;ons; others under that of u&s;urpers &s;pringing out of their own confu&s;ions. Shame and oppre&s;&s;ion ere long awakened their love of liberty. A few cities re-united. Their example was followed by others, as opportunities were found of cutting off their tyrants. The league &s;oon embraced almo&s;t the whole Peloponne&s;us. Macedon &s;aw its progre&s;s; but was hindered by internal di&s;&s;entions from &s;topping it. All Greece caught the enthu&s;ia&s;m, and &s;eemed ready to unite in one confederacy, when the jealou&s;y and envy in Sparta and Athens, of the ri&s;ing glory of the Achaeans, threw a fatal damp on the enterprize. The dread of the Macedonian power induced the league to court the alliance of the kings of Egypt and Syria; who, as &s;ucce&s;&s;ors of Alexander were rivals of the king of Macedon. This policy was defeated by Cleomenes, king of Sparta, who was led by his ambition to make an unprovoked attack on his neighbours the Achaeans; and who as an enemy to Macedon, had intere&s;t enough with the Egyptian and Syrian princes, to effect a breach of their engagements with the league. The Achaeans were now reduced to the dilemma of &s;ubmitting to Cleomenes, or of &s;upplicating the aid of Macedon, its former oppre&s;&s;or. The latter expedient was adopted. The conte&s;t of the Greeks always afforded a plea&s;ing opportunity to that powerful neighbour, of intermeddling in their affairs. A Macedonian army quickly appeared: Cleomenes was vanqui&s;hed. The Achaeans &s;oon experienced, as often happens, that a victorious and powerful ally, is but another name for a ma&s;ter. All that their mo&s;t abject compliances
<PB N="113" REF="021127_0118_0FB245D1D76E8130">
could obtain from him was a toleration of the exerci&s;e of their laws. Philip, who was now on the throne of Macedon, &s;oon provoked, by his tyrannies, fre&s;h combinations among the Greeks. The Achaeans, though weakened by internal di&s;&s;entions, and by the revolt of Me&s;&s;ene one of its members, being joined by the Etolians and Athenians, erected the &s;tandard of oppo&s;ition. Finding them&s;elves, though thus &s;upported unequal to the undertaking, they once more had recour&s;e to the dangerous expedient of introducing the &s;uccour of foreign arms. The Romans to whom the invitation was made, eagerly embraced it. Philip was conquered: Macedon &s;ubdued. A new cri&s;is en&s;ued to the league. Di&s;&s;en|tions broke out among its members. The&s;e the Romans fo&s;tered. Callicrates and other popular leaders, became mercenary in&s;truments for inveig|ling their countrymen. The more effectually to nouri&s;h di&s;cord and di&s;order, the Romans had, to the a&s;toni&s;hment of tho&s;e who confided in their &s;incerity, already proclaimed univer&s;al liberty <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This was but another name more &s;pecious for the indepen|dence of the members on the federal head.</NOTE> throughout Greece. With the &s;ame in&s;idious views, they now &s;educed the members from the league, by repre|&s;enting to their pride, the violation it committed on their &s;overeignty. By the&s;e arts, this union, the la&s;t hope of Greece, the la&s;t hope of antient liberty, was torn into pieces; and &s;uch imbecility and di&s;traction introduced, that the arms of Rome found little diffi|culty in compleating the ruin which their arts had commenced. The Achaeans were cut to pieces; and Achaia loaded with chains, under which it is groan|ing at this hour.</P>

<P>THE examples of antient confederacies, cited in my la&s;t paper, have not exhau&s;ted the &s;ource of experimental in&s;truction on this &s;ubject. There are exi&s;ting in&s;titutions, founded on a &s;imilar prin|ciple, which merit particular con&s;ideration. The fir&s;t which pre&s;ents it&s;elf is the Germanic body.</P>
<P>In the early ages of chri&s;tianity Germany was occupied by &s;even di&s;tinct nations, who had no com|mon chief. The Franks, one of the number, having conquered the Gauls, e&s;tabli&s;hed the kingdom which has taken its name from them. In the ninth century, Charlemagne, its warlike monarch, carried his victo|rious arms in every direction; and Germany became a part of his va&s;t dominions. On the di&s;member|ment, which took place under his &s;ons, this part was erected into a &s;eparate and independent empire. Charlemagne and his immediate de&s;cendants po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the reality, as well as the en&s;igns and dignity of impe|rial power. But the principal va&s;&s;als, who&s;e fiefs had become hereditary, and who compo&s;ed the national diets which Charlemagne had not aboli&s;hed, gradu|ally threw off the yoke, and advanced to &s;overeign juri&s;diction and independence. The force of imperial &s;overeignty was in&s;ufficient to re&s;train &s;uch powerful dependents; or to pre&s;erve the unity and tranquility of the empire. The mo&s;t furious private wars, accom|panied with every &s;pecies of calamity, were carried on between the different princes and &s;tates. The
<PB N="115" REF="021127_0120_0FB245D96AED4DB8">
imperial authority, unable to maintain the public order, declined by degrees, till it was almo&s;t extinct in the anarchy, which agitated the long interval between the death of the la&s;t emperor of the Suabian, and the acce&s;&s;ion of the fir&s;t emperor of the Au&s;trian lines. In the eleventh century, the emperors enjoyed full &s;ove|reignty: In the fifteenth they had little more than the &s;ymbols and decorations of power.</P>
<P>Out of this feudal &s;y&s;tem, which has it&s;elf many of the important features of a confederacy, has grown the federal &s;y&s;tem, which con&s;titutes the Germanic empire. Its powers are ve&s;ted in a diet repre&s;enting the component members of the confederacy; in the emperor who is the executive magi&s;trate, with a nega|tive on the decrees of the diet; and in the imperial chamber and aulic council, two judiciary tribunals having &s;upreme juri&s;diction in controver&s;ies which concern the empire, or which happen among its members.</P>
<P>The diet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the general power of legi&s;lating for the empire&mdash;of making war and peace&mdash;contract|ing alliances&mdash;a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing quotas of troops and money&mdash; con&s;tructing fortre&s;&s;es&mdash;regulating coin&mdash;admitting new members&mdash;and &s;ubjecting di&s;obedient members to the ban of the empire, by which the party is degraded from his &s;overeign rights, and his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions forfeited. The members of the confederacy are expre&s;sly re&s;tricted from entering into compacts, prejudicial to the empire, from impo&s;ing tolls and duties on their mutual intercour&s;e, without the con|&s;ent of the emperor and diet; from altering the value of money; from doing inju&s;tice to one another; or from affording a&s;&s;i&s;tance or retreat to di&s;turbers of the public peace. And the ban is denounced again&s;t &s;uch as &s;hall violate any of the&s;e re&s;trictions. The members of the diet, as &s;uch, are &s;ubject in all ca&s;es to be judged by the emperor and diet, and in their private capacities, by the aulic council and imperial chamber.</P>
<P><PB N="116" REF="021127_0121_0FB245DAE4CCD278">The prerogotives of the emperor are numerous. The mo&s;t important of them are, his exclu&s;ive right to make propo&s;itions to the diet&mdash;to negative its re&s;o|lutions&mdash;to name amba&s;&s;adors&mdash;to confer dignities and titles&mdash;to fill vacant electorates&mdash;to found univer|&s;ities&mdash;to grant privileges not injurious to the &s;tates of the empire&mdash;to receive and apply the public reve|nues&mdash;and generally to watch over the public &s;afety. In certain ca&s;es, the electors form a council to him. In quality of emperor he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es no territory within the empire; nor receives any revenue for his &s;up|port. But his revenue and dominions, in other qualities, con&s;titute him one of the mo&s;t powerful princes in Europe.</P>
<P>From &s;uch a parade of con&s;titutional powers, in the repre&s;entatives and head of this confederacy, the natural &s;uppo&s;ition would be, that it mu&s;t form an exception to the general character which belongs to its kindred &s;y&s;tems. Nothing would be farther from the reality. The fundamental principle, on which it re&s;ts, that the empire is a community of &s;overeigns; that the diet is a repre&s;entation of &s;overeigns; and that the laws are addre&s;&s;ed to &s;overeigns; render the empire a nervele&s;s body; incapable of regulating its own members; in&s;ecure again&s;t external dangers; and agitated with uncea&s;ing fermentations in its own bowels.</P>
<P>The hi&s;tory of Germany is a hi&s;tory of wars between the emperor and the princes and &s;tates; of wars among the princes and &s;tates them&s;elves; of the licentiou&s;|ne&s;s of the &s;trong, and the oppre&s;&s;ion of the weak; of foreign intru&s;ions, and foreign intrigues; of requi|&s;itions of men and money, di&s;regarded, or parti|ally complied with; of attempts to enforce them, altogether abortive, or attended with &s;laughter and de&s;olation, involving the innocent with the guilty; of general imbecilty, confu&s;ion and mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>In the &s;ixteenth century, the emperor with one part of the empire on his &s;ide, was &s;een engaged again&s;t
<PB N="117" REF="021127_0122_0FB245E4797B1E50">
the other princes and &s;tates. In one of the conflicts, the emperor him&s;elf was put to flight, and very near being made pri&s;oner by the elector of Saxony. The late king of Pru&s;&s;ia was more than once pitted again&s;t his imperial &s;overeign; and commonly proved an overmatch for him. Controver&s;ies and wars among the members them&s;elves have been &s;o common, that the German annals are crowded with the bloody pages which de&s;cribe them. Previous to the peace of We&s;tphalia, Germany was de&s;olated by a war of thirty years, in which the emperor, with one half of the empire was on one &s;ide; and Sweden with the other half on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide. Peace was at length negotiated and dictated by foreign powers; and the articles of it, to which foreign powers are parties, made a fundamental part of the Germanic con&s;titution.</P>
<P>If the nation happens, on any emergency, to be more united by the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;elf defence; its &s;itu|ation is &s;till deplorable. Military preparations mu&s;t be preceded by &s;o many tedious di&s;cu&s;&s;ions, ari&s;ing from the jealou&s;ies, pride, &s;eparate views, and cla&s;hing preten&s;ions, of &s;overeign bodies; that before the diet can &s;ettle the arrangements, the enemy are in the field; and before the federal troops are ready to take it, are retiring into winter quarters.</P>
<P>The &s;mall body of national troops which has been judged nece&s;&s;ary in time of peace, is defectively kept up, badly paid, infected with local prejudices, and &s;upported by irregular and di&s;proportionate contri|butions to the trea&s;ury.</P>
<P>The impo&s;&s;ibility of maintaining order, and di&s;pen|&s;ing ju&s;tice among the&s;e &s;overeign &s;ubjects, produced the experiment of dividing the empire into nine or ten circles or di&s;tricts; of giving them an interior organization; and of charging them with the mili|tary execution of the laws again&s;t delinquent and contumacious members. This experiment has only &s;erved to demon&s;trate more fully, the radical vice of
<PB N="118" REF="021127_0123_0FB245E7607F4660">
the con&s;titution. Each circle is the miniature picture of the deformities of this political mon&s;ter. They either fail to execute their commi&s;&s;ions, or they do it with all the deva&s;tation and carnage of civil war. Sometimes whole circles are defaulters, and then they increa&s;e the mi&s;chief which they were in&s;tituted to remedy.</P>
<P>We may form &s;ome judgment of this &s;cheme of military coertion, from a &s;ample given by Thuanus. In Donawerth, a free and imperial city, of the circle of Suabia, the abb&egrave; de St. Croix enjoyed certain immunities which had been re&s;erved to him. In the exerci&s;e of the&s;e, on &s;ome public occa&s;ion, outrages were committed on him, by the people of the city. The con&s;equence was, that the city was put under the ban of the empire; and the duke of Bavaria, though director of another circle, obtained an appoint|ment to enforce it. He &s;oon appeared before the city, with a corps of ten thou&s;and troops and finding it a fit occa&s;ion, as he had &s;ecretly intended from the begin|ning, to revive an antiquated claim, on the pretext that his ance&s;tors had &s;uffered the place to be di&s;mem|bered from his territory<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pfeffel, Nouvel abreg. chronol. de l'hi&s;t. &amp;c. d'Allemagne, &s;ays the pretext was to indemnify him&s;elf for the expence of the expedition.</NOTE>; he took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, in his own name; di&s;armed and puni&s;hed the inhabi|tants, and re-annexed the city to his domains.</P>
<P>It may be a&s;ked perhaps what has &s;o long kept this disjointed machine from falling entirely to pieces? The an&s;wer is obvious. The weakne&s;s of mo&s;t of the members, who are unwilling to expo&s;e them&s;elves to the mercy of foreign powers; the weakne&s;s of mo&s;t of the principal members, compared with the formi|dable powers all around them; the va&s;t weight and influence which the emperor derives from his &s;eparate and hereditary dominions; and the intere&s;t he feels in pre&s;erving a &s;y&s;tem, with which his family pride is connected, and which con&s;titutes him the fir&s;t prince

in Europe; the&s;e cau&s;es &s;upport a feeble and preca|rious union; whil&s;t the repellent quality, incident to the nature of &s;overeignty, and which time continually &s;trengthens, prevents any reform whatever, founded on a proper con&s;olidation. Nor is it to be imagined, if this ob&s;tacle could be &s;urmounted, that the neigh|bouring powers would &s;uffer a revolution to take place, which would give to the empire the force and pre-eminence to which it is entitled. Foreign nations have long con&s;idered them&s;elves as intere&s;ted in the changes made by events in this con&s;titution; and have, on various occa&s;ions, betrayed their policy of perpetuating its anarchy and weakne&s;s.</P>
<P>If more direct examples were wanting, Poland as a government over local &s;overeigns, might not impro|perly be taken notice of. Nor could any proof more &s;triking, be given of the calamities flowing f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">om &s;uch in&s;titutions. Equally unfit for &s;elf government, and &s;elf defence, it has long been at the mercy of its powerful neighbours; who have lately had the mercy to di&s;burden it of one third of its people and territories.</P>
<P>The connection among the Swi&s;s cantons &s;carcely amounts to a confederacy; though it is &s;ometimes cited as an in&s;tance of the &s;tability of &s;uch in&s;titutions.</P>
<P>They have no common trea&s;ury&mdash;no common troops even in war&mdash;no common coin&mdash;no common judica|tory, nor any other common mark of &s;overeignty.</P>
<P>They are kept together by the peculiarity of their topographical po&s;ition, by their individual weakne&s;s and in&s;ignificancy; by the fear of powerful neigh|bours, to one of which they were formerly &s;ubject; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y the few &s;ources of contention among a people of &s;uch &s;imple and homogeneous manners; by their joint intere&s;t in their dependent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions; by the mutual aid they &s;tand in need of, for &s;uppre&s;&s;ing in&s;urrections and rebellions; an aid expre&s;sly &s;tipu|lated, and often required and afforded; and by the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;ome regular and permanent provi&s;ion for

accommodating di&s;putes among the cantons. The provi&s;ion is, that the parties at variance &s;hall each chu&s;e four judges out of the neutral cantons who in ca&s;e of di&s;agreement, chu&s;e an umpire. This tribunal, under an oath of impartiality, pronounces definitive &s;entence; which all the cantons are bound to enforce. The competency of this regulation may be e&s;timated, by a clau&s;e in their treaty of 1683, with Victor Amadeus of Savoy; in which he obliges him&s;elf to interpo&s;e as mediator in di&s;putes between the cantoas; and to employ force, if nece&s;&s;ary, again&s;t the contu|macious party.</P>
<P>So far as the peculiarity of their ca&s;e will admit of compari&s;on with that of the United States; it &s;erves to confirm the principle intended to be e&s;tabli&s;hed. Whatever efficacy the union may have had in ordi|nary ca&s;es, it appears that the moment a cau&s;e of difference &s;prang up, capable of trying its &s;trength, it failed. The controver&s;ies on the &s;ubject of religion&punc; which in three in&s;tances have kindled violent and bloody conte&s;ts, may be &s;aid in fact to have &s;evered the league. The Prote&s;tant and Catholic cantons have &s;ince had their &s;eparate diets; where all the mo&s;t important concerns are adju&s;ted, and which have left the general diet little other bu&s;ine&s;s than to take care of the common bailages.</P>
<P>That &s;eparation had another con&s;equence which merits attention. It produced oppo&s;ite alliances with foreign powers; of Bern as the head of the Prote&s;tant a&s;&s;ociation, with the United Provinces; and of Luzerne, as the head of the Catholic a&s;&s;oci|ation, with France.</P>

<HEAD>NUMBER XX. The Subject continued, with farther Examples.</HEAD>
<P>THE United Netherlands are a confederacy of republics, or rather of ari&s;tocracies, of a very remarkable texture; yet confirming all the le&s;&s;ons derived from tho&s;e which we have already reviewed.</P>
<P>The union is compo&s;ed of &s;even co-equal and &s;ove|reign &s;tates, and each &s;tate or province is a compo|&s;ition of equal and independent cities. In all impor|tant ca&s;es not only the provinces, but the cities mu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t be unanimous.</P>
<P>The &s;overeignty of the union is repre&s;ented by the &s;tates general, con&s;i&s;ting u&s;ually of about fifty depu|ties appointed by the provinces. They hold their &s;eats, &s;ome for life, &s;ome for &s;ix, three and one years. From two provinces they continue in appointment during plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>The &s;tates general have authority to enter into treaties and alliances&mdash;to make war and peace&mdash;to rai&s;e armies and equip fleets&mdash;to a&s;certain quotas and demand contributions. In all the&s;e ca&s;es however, unanimity and the &s;anction of their con&s;tituents are requi&s;ite. They have authority to appoint and receive amba&s;&s;adors&mdash;to execute treaties and alliances already formed&mdash;to provide for the collection of duties on imports and exports&mdash;to regulate the mint, with a &s;aving to the provincial rights&mdash;to govern as &s;ove|reigns the dependent territories. The provinces are re&s;trained, unle&s;s with the general con&s;ent, from entering into foreign treaties&mdash;from e&s;tabli&s;hing impo&s;ts injurious to others, or charging their neigh|bours with higher duties than their own &s;ubjects. A council of &s;tate, a chamber of accounts, with five colleges of admiralty, aid and fortify the federal admini&s;tration.</P>
<P><PB N="122" REF="021127_0127_0FB245FA6C2957F8">The executive magi&s;trate of the union is the &s;tadtholder, who is now a hereditary prince. His principal weight and influence in the republic are derived from his independent title; from his great patrimonial e&s;tates; from his family connections with &s;ome of the chief potentates of Europe; and more than all, perhaps, from his being &s;tadtholder in the &s;everal provinces, as well as for the union, in which provincial quality, he has the appointment of town magi&s;trates under certain regulations, executes pro|vincial decrees, pre&s;ides when he plea&s;es in the provincial tribunals; and has throughout the power of pardon.</P>
<P>As &s;tadtholder of the union, he has however con&s;i|derable prerogatives.</P>
<P>In his political capacity he has authority to &s;ettle di&s;putes between the provinces, when other methods fail&mdash;to a&s;&s;i&s;t at the deliberations of the &s;tates general, and at their particular conferences&mdash;to give audiences to foreign amba&s;&s;adors, and to keep agents for his particular affairs at foreign courts.</P>
<P>In his military capacity, he commands the federal troops&mdash;provides for garri&s;ons, and in general regu|lates military affairs&mdash;di&s;po&s;es of all appointments from colonels to en&s;igns, and of the governments and po&s;ts of fortified towns.</P>
<P>In his marine capacity, he is admiral general, and &s;uperintends and directs every thing relative to naval forces, and other naval affairs&mdash;pre&s;ides in the admi|ralities in per&s;on or by proxy&mdash;appoints lieutenant admirals and other officers&mdash;and e&s;tabli&s;hes councils of war, who&s;e &s;entences are not executed till he approves them.</P>
<P>His revenue, exclu&s;ive of his private income, amounts to 300,000 florins. The &s;tanding army which he commands con&s;i&s;ts of about 40,000 men.</P>
<P>Such is the nature of the celebrated Belgi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> con|federacy, as delineated on parchment. What are the characters which practice has &s;tampt upon it?
<PB N="123" REF="021127_0128_0FB2460596F52E98">
Imbecility in the government; di&s;cord among the provinces; foreign influence and indignities; a precarious exi&s;tence in peace, and peculiar cala|mities from war.</P>
<P>It was long ago remarked by Grotius, that nothing but the hatred of his countrymen to the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria, kept them from being ruined by the vices of their con&s;titution.</P>
<P>The union of Utrecht, &s;ays another re&s;pectable writer, repo&s;es an authority in the &s;tates general &s;eemingly &s;ufficient to &s;ecure harmony, but the jealou&s;y in each provin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> renders the practice very different from the theory.</P>
<P>The &s;ame in&s;trument &s;ays another, obliges each province to levy certain contributions; but this article never could and probably never will be executed; becau&s;e the inland provinces who have little com|merce cannot pay an equal quota.</P>
<P>In matters of contribution, it is the practice to wave the articles of the con&s;titution. The danger of delay obliges the con&s;enting provinces to furni&s;h their quotas, without waiting for the others; and then to obtain reimbur&s;ement from the others, by depu|tations, which are frequent, or otherwi&s;e as they can. The great wealth and influence of the province of Holland, enable her to effect both the&s;e purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>It has more than once happened that the defici|encies have been ultimately to be collected at the point of the bayonet; a thing practicable, though dreadful, in a confederacy, where one of the members exceeds in force all the re&s;t; and where &s;everal of them are too &s;mall to meditate re&s;i&s;tance: But utterly impracticable in one compo&s;ed of members, &s;everal of which are equal to each other in &s;trength and re&s;ources, and equal &s;ingly to a vigorous and per&s;e|vering defence.</P>
<P>Foreign mini&s;ters, &s;ays Sir William Temple, who was him&s;elf a foreign mini&s;ter, elude matters taken <HI>ad referendum,</HI> by tampering with the provinces and
<PB N="124" REF="021127_0129_0FB246066B836B68">
cities. In 1726, the treaty of Hanover was delayed by the&s;e means a whole year. In&s;tances of a like nature are numerous and notorious.</P>
<P>In critical emergencies, the &s;tates general are often compelled to overleap their con&s;titutional bounds. In 1688, they concluded a treaty of them&s;elves at the ri&s;k of their heads. The treaty of We&s;tphalia in 1648, by which their independence was formally and finally recognized, was concluded without the con&s;ent of Zeland. Even as recently as the la&s;t treaty of peace with Great-Britain, the con&s;titutional principle of unanimity was departed from. A weak con&s;titu|tion mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily terminate in di&s;&s;olution, for want of proper powers, or the u&s;urpation of powers requi&s;ite for the public &s;afety. Whether the u&s;ur|pation, when once begun, will &s;top at the &s;alutary point, or go forward to the dangerous extreme, mu&s;t depend on the contingencies of the moment. Tyranny has perhaps oftener grown out of the a&s;&s;umptions of power, called for, on pre&s;&s;ing exigencies, by a defective con&s;titution, than out of the full exerci&s;e of the large&s;t con&s;titutional authorities.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the calamities produced by the &s;tadtholder&s;hip, it has been &s;uppo&s;ed, that without his influence in the individual provinces, the cau&s;es of anarchy manife&s;t in the confederacy, would long ago have di&s;&s;olved it.
<Q>Under &s;uch a government, &s;ays the abb&egrave; Mably, the union could never have &s;ub&s;i&s;ted, if the provinces had not a &s;pring within them&s;elves, capable of quickening their tardine&s;s, and compelling them to the &s;ame way of thinking. This &s;pring is the &s;tadtholder.</Q>
It is remarked by Sir William Temple,
<Q>that in the intermi&s;&s;ions of the &s;tadtholder&s;hip, Holland by her riches and her authority which drew the others into a &s;ort of dependence, &s;upplied the place.</Q></P>
<P>The&s;e are not the only circum&s;tances which have controuled the tendency to anarchy and di&s;&s;olution. The &s;urrounding powers impo&s;e an ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity

of union to a certain degree, at the &s;ame time, that they nouri&s;h by their intrigues, the con&s;titutional vices, which keep the republic in &s;ome degree always at their mercy.</P>
<P>The true patriots have long bewailed the fatal tendency of the&s;e vices and have made no le&s;s than four regular experiments by <HI>extraordinary a&s;&s;emblies,</HI> convened for the &s;pecial purpo&s;e, to apply a remedy: As many times, has their laudable zeal found it impo&s;&s;ible to <HI>unite the public councils</HI> in reforming the known, the acknowledged, the fatal evils of the exi&s;t|ing con&s;titution. Let us pau&s;e my fellow citizens, for one moment, over this melancholy and monitory le&s;&s;on of hi&s;tory; and with the tear that drops for the calamities brought on mankind by their adver&s;e opinions and &s;elfi&s;h pa&s;&s;ions; let our gratitude mingle an ejaculation to Heaven, for the propitious concord which has di&s;tingui&s;hed the con&s;ultations for our political happine&s;s.</P>
<P>A de&s;ign was al&s;o conceived of e&s;tabli&s;hing a general tax to be admini&s;tered by the federal authority. This al&s;o had its adver&s;aries and failed.</P>
<P>This unhappy people &s;eem to be now &s;uffering from popular convul&s;ions, from di&s;&s;entions among the &s;tates and from the actual inva&s;ion of foreign arms, the cri&s;is of their de&s;tiny. All nations have their eyes fixed on the awful &s;pectacle. The fir&s;t wi&s;h prompted by humanity is, that this &s;evere trial may i&s;&s;ue in &s;uch a revolution of their government, as will e&s;tabli&s;h their union, and render it the parent of tranquility, freedom and happine&s;s: The next, that the a&s;ylum under which, we tru&s;t, the enjoyment of the&s;e ble&s;&s;ings, will &s;peedily be &s;ecured in this country, may receive and con&s;ole them for the cata&s;trophe of their own.</P>
<P>I make no apology for having dwelt &s;o long on the contemplation of the&s;e federal precedents. Experience is the oracle of truth; and where its re&s;pon&s;es are unequivocal, they ought to be conclu&s;ive and &s;acred. The important truth, which it unequivocally pro|nounces

<HEAD>NUMBER XXI. Further Defects of the pre&s;ent Con&s;titution.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING in the three la&s;t numbers taken a &s;ummary review of the principal circum&s;tances and events which depict the genius and fate of other confederate governments; I &s;hall now proceed in the enumeration of the mo&s;t important of tho&s;e defects, which have hitherto di&s;appointed our hopes from the &s;y&s;tem e&s;tabli&s;hed among our&s;elves. To form a &s;afe and &s;atisfactory judgment of the proper remedy, it is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary that we &s;hould be well acquainted with the extent and malignity of the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>The next mo&s;t palpable defect of the exi&s;ting confe|deration is the total want of a SANCTION to its laws. The United States as now compo&s;ed, have no power to exact obedience, or puni&s;h di&s;obedience to their re&s;olutions, either by pecuniary mulcts, by a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion or dive&s;titure of privileges, or by any other con&s;titutional means. There is no expre&s;s delegation of authority to them to u&s;e force again&s;t delinquent members; and if &s;uch a right &s;hould be a&s;cribed to the federal head, as re&s;ulting from the nature of the &s;ocial compact between the &s;tates, it mu&s;t be by infer|ence and con&s;truction, in the face of that part of the &s;econd article, by which it is declared,
<Q>that
<PB N="127" REF="021127_0132_0FB246152EEE86C0">
each &s;tate &s;hall retain every power, juri&s;diction and right, not <HI>expre&s;sly</HI> delegated to the United States in Congre&s;s a&s;&s;embled.</Q>
The want of &s;uch a right involves no doubt a &s;triking ab&s;urdity; but we are reduced to the dilemma either of &s;uppo&s;ing that defi|ciency, prepo&s;terous as it may &s;eem, or of contra|vening or explaining away a provi&s;ion, which has been of late a repeated theme of the eulogies of tho&s;e, who oppo&s;e the new con&s;titution; and the omi&s;&s;ion of which in that plan, has been the &s;ubject of much plau|&s;ible animadver&s;ion and &s;evere critici&s;m. If we are unwilling to impair the force of this applauded provi|&s;ion, we &s;hall be obliged to conclude, that the United States afford the extraordinary &s;pectacle of a govern|ment, de&s;titute even of the &s;hadow of con&s;titutional power to enforce the execution of its own laws. It will appear from the &s;pecimens which have been cited, that the American confederacy in this parti|cular, &s;tands di&s;criminated from every other in&s;ti|tution of a &s;imilar kind, and exhibits a new and unexampled phenomenon in the political world.</P>
<P>The want of a mutual guarantee of the &s;tate govern|ments is another capital imperfection in the federal plan. There is nothing of this kind declared in the articles that compo&s;e it; and to imply a tacit gua|rantee from con&s;iderations of utility, would be a &s;till more flagrant departure from the clau&s;e which has been mentioned, than to imply a tacit power of coer|tion, from the like con&s;iderations. The want of a guarantee, though it might in its con&s;equences endanger the union, does not &s;o immediately attack its exi&s;tence as the want of a con&s;titutional &s;anction to its laws.</P>
<P>Without a guarantee, the a&s;&s;i&s;tance to be derived from the union in repelling tho&s;e dome&s;tic dangers, which may &s;ometimes threaten the exi&s;tence of the &s;tate con&s;titutions, mu&s;t be renounced. U&s;urpation may rear its cre&s;t in each &s;tate, and trample upon the liberties of the people; while the national
<PB N="128" REF="021127_0133_0FB24616E66D0940">
government could legally do nothing more than be|hold its encroachments with indignation and regret. A &s;ucce&s;sful faction may erect a tyranny on the ruins of order and law, while no &s;uccour could con&s;titu|tionally be afforded by the union to the friends and &s;upporters of the government. The tempe&s;tuous &s;ituation, from which Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts has &s;carcely emerged, evinces that dangers of this kind are not merely &s;peculative. Who can determine what might have been the i&s;&s;ue of her late convul&s;ions, if the mal-contents had been headed by a Ce&s;ar or by a Cromwell? Who can predict what effect a de&s;poti&s;m e&s;tabli&s;hed in Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts would have upon the liberties of New-Hamp&s;hire or Rhode-I&s;land; of Connecticut or New-York.</P>
<P>The inordinate pride of &s;tate importance has &s;ugge&s;ted to &s;ome minds an objection to the principle of a guarantee in the federal government; as involv|ing an officious interference in the dome&s;tic concerns of the members. A &s;cruple of this kind would deprive us of one of the principal advantages to be expected from union; and can only flow from a rai&s;appre|hen&s;ion of the nature of the provi&s;ion it&s;elf. It could be no impediment to reforms of the &s;tate con&s;titutions by a majority of the people in a legal and peaceable mode. This right would remain undimini&s;hed. The guarantee could only operate again&s;t changes to be effected by violence. Towards the prevention of cala|mities of this kind too many checks cannot be pro|vided. The peace of &s;ociety, and the &s;tability of government, depend ab&s;olutely on the efficacy of the precautions adopted on this head. Where the whole power of the government is in the hands of the people, there is the le&s;s pretence for the u&s;e of violent reme|dies, in partial or occa&s;ional di&s;tempers of the &s;tate. The natural cure for an ill admini&s;tration, in a popular or repre&s;entative con&s;titution, is a change of men. A guarantee by the national authority would be as much directed again&s;t the u&s;urpations of rulers, as
<PB N="129" REF="021127_0134_0FB246199E677A50">
again&s;t the ferments and outrages of faction and &s;edi|tion in the community.</P>
<P>The principle of regulating the contributions of the &s;tates to the common trea&s;ury by QUOTAS is another fundamental error in the confederation. Its repug|nancy to an adequate &s;upply of the national exigencies has been already pointed out, and has &s;ufficiently appeared from the trial which has been made of it. I &s;peak of it now &s;olely with a view to equality among the &s;tates. Tho&s;e who have been accu&s;tomed to con|template the circum&s;tances, which produce and con&s;ti|tute national wealth, mu&s;t be &s;atisfied that there is no common &s;tandard, or barometer, by which the degrees of it can be a&s;certained. Neither the value of lands nor the numbers of the people, which have been &s;ucce&s;&s;ively propo&s;ed as the rule of &s;tate contri|butions, has any preten&s;ion to being a ju&s;t repre&s;en|tative. If we compare the wealth of the United Netherlands with that of Ru&s;&s;ia or Germany or even of France; and if we at the &s;ame time compare the total value of the lands, and the aggregate popula|tion of the contracted territory of that republic, with the total value of the lands, and the aggregate popu|lation of the immen&s;e regions of either of tho&s;e king|doms, we &s;hall at once di&s;cover that there is no com|pari&s;on between the proportion of either of the&s;e two objects and that of the relative wealth of tho&s;e nations. If the like parallel were to be run between &s;everal of the American &s;tates; it would furni&s;h a like re&s;ult. Let Virginia be contra&s;ted with North-Carolina, Penn&s;ylvania with Connecticut, or Maryland with New-Jer&s;ey, and we &s;hall be convinced that the re&s;pective abilities of tho&s;e &s;tates, in relation to revenue, bear little or no analogy to their compa|ritive &s;tock in lands or to their comparitive popu|lation.&mdash;The po&s;ition may be equally illu&s;trated by a &s;imilar proce&s;s between the counties of the &s;ame &s;tate. No man acquainted with the &s;tate of New-York will doubt, that the active wealth of Kings county bears
<PB N="130" REF="021127_0135_0FB24622B8FBB908">
a much greater proportion to that of Montgomery, than it would appear to do, if we &s;hould take either the total value of the lands or the total numbers of the people as a criterion!</P>
<P>The wealth of nations depends upon an infinite variety of cau&s;es. Situation, &s;oil, climate, the nature of the productions, the nature of the government, the genius of the citizens&mdash;the degree of informa|tion they po&s;&s;e&s;s&mdash;the &s;tate of commerce, of arts, of indu&s;try&mdash;the&s;e circum&s;tances and many more too complex, minute, or adventitious, to admit of a parti|cular &s;pecification, occa&s;ion differences hardly con|ceivable in the relative opulence and riches of differ|ent countries. The con&s;equence clearly is, that there can be no common mea&s;ure of national wealth; and of cour&s;e, no general or &s;tationary rule, by which the ability of a &s;tate to pay taxes can be determined. The attempt therefore to regulate the contributions of the members of a confederacy, by any &s;uch rule, connot fail to be productive of glaring inequality and extreme oppre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>This inequality would of it&s;elf be &s;ufficient in America to work the eventual de&s;truction of the union, if any mode of inforcing a compliance with its requi&s;itions could be devi&s;ed. The &s;uffering &s;tates would not long con&s;ent to remain a&s;&s;ociated upon a principle which di&s;tributed the public burthens with &s;o unequal a hand; and which was calculated to impoveri&s;h and oppre&s;s the citizens of &s;ome &s;tates, while tho&s;e of others would &s;carcely be con&s;cious of the &s;mall proportion of the weight they were required to &s;u&s;tain. This however is an evil in&s;eparable from the principle of quotas and requi&s;itions.</P>
<P>There is no method of &s;teering clear of this incon|venience but by authori&s;ing the national government to rai&s;e its own revenues in its own way. Impo&s;ts, exci&s;es and in general all duties upon articles of con&s;umption may be compared to a fluid, which will in time find its level with the means of paying them.
<PB N="131" REF="021127_0136_0FB24623B6357CB8">
The amount to be contributed by each citizen will in a degree be at his own option, and can be regulated by an attention to his re&s;ources. The rich may be extravagant, the poor can be frugal. And private oppre&s;&s;ion, may always be avoided by a judicious &s;election of objects proper for &s;uch impo&s;itions. If inequalities &s;hould ari&s;e in &s;ome &s;tates from duties on particular objects, the&s;e will in all probability be counterbalanced by proportional inequalities in other &s;tates from the duties on other objects. In the cour&s;e of time and things, an equilibrium, as far as it is attainable, in &s;o complicated a &s;ubject, will be e&s;tabli&s;hed every where. Or if inequalities &s;hould &s;till exi&s;t they would neither be &s;o great in their degree, &s;o uniform in their operation, nor &s;o odious in their appearance, as tho&s;e which would nece&s;|&s;arily &s;pring from quotas upon any &s;cale, that can po&s;&s;ibly be devi&s;ed.</P>
<P>It is a &s;ignal advantage of taxes on articles of con&s;umption, that they contain in their own nature a &s;ecurity again&s;t exce&s;s. They pre&s;cribe their own limit; which cannot be exceeded without defeating the end propo&s;ed&mdash;that is an exten&s;ion of the revenue. When applied to this object, the &s;aying is as ju&s;t as it is witty, that
<Q>in political arithmetic, two and two do not always make four.</Q>
If duties are too high they le&s;&s;en the con&s;umption&mdash;the collection is eluded; and the product to the trea&s;ury is not &s;o great as when they are confined within proper and moderate bounds. This forms a compleat barrier again&s;t any material oppre&s;&s;ion of the citizens, by taxes of this cla&s;s, and is it&s;elf a natural limitation of the power of impo&s;ing them.</P>
<P>Impo&s;itions of this kind u&s;ually fall under the denomination of indirect taxes, and mu&s;t for a long time con&s;titute the chief part of the revenue rai&s;ed in this country. Tho&s;e of the direct kind, which prin|cipally relate to lands and buildings, may admit of a rule of apportionment. Either the value of land,
<PB N="132" REF="021127_0137_0FB2462F03FBFD30">
or the number of the people may &s;erve as a &s;tandard. The &s;tate of agriculture, and the populou&s;ne&s;s of a country, are con&s;idered as having a near relation to each other. And as a rule for the purpo&s;e intended, numbers in the view of &s;implicity and certainty, are entitled to a preference. In every country it is an Herculean ta&s;k to obtain a valuation of the land; in a country imperfectly &s;ettled and progre&s;&s;ive in improvement, the difficulties are increa&s;ed almo&s;t to impracticability. The expence of an accurate valu|ation is in all &s;ituations a formidable objection. In a branch of taxation where no limits to the di&s;cretion of the government are to be found in the nature of the thing, the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a fixed rule, not incompatible with the end, may be attended with fewer inconveniencies than to leave that di&s;cretion altogether at large.</P>

<HEAD>NUMBER XXII. The &s;ame Subject continued and concluded.</HEAD>
<P>IN addition to the defects already enumerated in the exi&s;ting federal &s;y&s;tem, there are others of not le&s;s importance, which concur in rendering it altogether unfit for the admini&s;tration of the affairs of the union.</P>
<P>The want of a power to regulate commerce is by all parties allowed to be of the number. The utility of &s;uch a power has been anticipated under the fir&s;t head of our enquiries; and for this rea&s;on as well as from the univer&s;al conviction entertained upon the &s;ubject, little need be added in this place. It is indeed evident, on the mo&s;t &s;uperficial view, that there is no object, either as it re&s;pects the intere&s;ts of trade or finance that more &s;trongly demands a
<PB N="133" REF="021127_0138_0FB2463065768F98">
federal &s;uperintendence. The want of it has already operated as a bar to the formation of beneficial treaties with foreign powers; and has given occa&s;ions of di&s;&s;a|tisfaction between the &s;tates. No nation acquainted with the nature of our political a&s;&s;ociation would be unwi&s;e enough to enter into &s;tipulations with the United States, conceding on their part privileges of importance, while they were appri&s;ed that the engage|ments on the part of the union, might at any moment be violated by its members; and while they found from experience that they might enjoy every advan|tage they de&s;ired in our markets, without granting us any return, but &s;uch as their momentary conve|nience might &s;ugge&s;t. It is not therefore to be won|dered at, that Mr. Jenkin&s;on in u&s;hering into the hou&s;e of commons a bill for regulating the temporary intercour&s;e between the two countries, &s;hould preface its introduction by a declaration that &s;imilar provi|&s;ions in former bills had been found to an&s;wer every purpo&s;e to the commerce of Great Britain, and that it would be prudent to per&s;i&s;t in the plan until it &s;hould appear whether the American government was likely or not to acquire greater con&s;i&s;tency<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This, as nearly as I can recollect, was the &s;en&s;e of this &s;peech in introducing the la&s;t bill.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Several &s;tates have endeavoured by &s;eparate prohi|bitions, re&s;trictions and exclu&s;ions, to influence the conduct of that kingdom in this particular; but the want of concert, ari&s;ing from the want of a general authority, and from cla&s;hing and di&s;&s;imilar views in the &s;tates, has hitherto fru&s;trated every experiment of the kind; and will continue to do &s;o as long as the &s;ame ob&s;tacles to an uniformity of mea&s;ures continue to exi&s;t.</P>
<P>The interfering and unneighbourly regulations of &s;ome &s;tates, contrary to the true &s;pirit of the union, have in different in&s;tances given ju&s;t cau&s;e of umbrage and complaint to others; and it is to be feared that
<PB N="134" REF="021127_0139_0FB24631E566FF38">
examples of this nature, if not re&s;trained by a na|tional controul, would be multiplied and extended till they became not le&s;s &s;erious &s;ources of animo&s;ity and di&s;cord, than injurious impediments to the intercour&s;e between the different parts of the confederacy.
<Q>The commerce of the German empire<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Encyclopedie, article Empire.</NOTE>, is in continual trammels from the multiplicity of the duties which the &s;everal princes and &s;tates exact upon the mer|chandizes pa&s;&s;ing through their territories; by means of which the fine &s;treams and navigable rivers with which Germany is &s;o happily watered, are rendered almo&s;t u&s;ele&s;s.</Q>
Though the genius of the people of this country might never permit this de&s;cription to be &s;trictly applicable to us, yet we may rea&s;onably expect, from the gradual conflicts of &s;tate regulations, that the citizens of each, would at length come to be con&s;idered and treated by the others in no better light than that of foreigners and aliens.</P>
<P>The power of rai&s;ing armies, by the mo&s;t obvious con&s;truction of the articles of the confederation, is merely a power of making requi&s;itions upon the &s;tates for quotas of men. This practice, in the cour&s;e of the late war, was found replete with ob&s;tructions to a vigorous and to an economical &s;y&s;tem of defence. It gave birth to a competition between the &s;tates, which created a kind of auction for men. In order to furni&s;h the quotas required of them, they outbid each other, till bounties grew to an enormous and in&s;up|portable &s;ize. The hope of a &s;till further increa&s;e afforded an inducement to tho&s;e who were di&s;po&s;ed to &s;erve to procra&s;tinate their inli&s;tment; and di&s;incli|ned them to engaging for any con&s;iderable periods. Hence &s;low and &s;canty levies of men in the mo&s;t cri|tical emergencies of our affairs&mdash;&s;hort inli&s;tments at an unparalleled expence&mdash;continual fluctuations in the troops, ruinous to their di&s;cipline, and &s;ubjecting the public &s;afety frequently to the perilous cri&s;is of a di&s;banded army.&mdash;Hence al&s;o tho&s;e oppre&s;&s;ive expe|dients
<PB N="135" REF="021127_0140_0FB2463B45E287E0">
for rai&s;ing men which were upon &s;everal occa|&s;ions practi&s;ed, and which nothing but the enthu&s;ia&s;m of liberty would have induced the people to endure.</P>
<P>This method of rai&s;ing troops is not more unfriendly to economy and vigor, than it is to an equal di&s;tri|bution of the burthen. The &s;tates near the &s;eat of war, influenced by motives of &s;elf pre&s;ervation made efforts to furni&s;h their quotas, which even exceeded their abilities, while tho&s;e at a di&s;tance from danger were for the mo&s;t part as remi&s;s as the others were diligent in their exertions. The immediate pre&s;&s;ure of this inequality was not in this ca&s;e, as in that of the contributions of money, alleviated by the hope of a final liquidation. The &s;tates which did not pay their proportions of money, might at lea&s;t be charged with their deficiencies; but no account could be formed of the deficiencies in the &s;upplies of men. We &s;hall not, however, &s;ee much rea&s;on to regret the want of this hope, when we con&s;ider how little pro&s;pect there is, that the mo&s;t delinquent &s;tates ever will be able to make compen&s;ation for their pecuniary failures. The &s;y&s;tem of quotas and requi&s;itions, whether it be applied to men or money, is in every view a &s;y&s;tem of imbeci|lity in the union, and of inequality and inju&s;tice among the members.</P>
<P>The right of equal &s;uffrage among the &s;tates is another exceptionable part of the confederation. Every idea of proportion, and every rule of fair repre|&s;entation con&s;pire to condemn a principle, which gives to Rhode-I&s;land an equal weight in the &s;cale of power with Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, or Connecticut, or New-York; and to Delaware, an equal voice in the nati|onal deliberations with Penn&s;ylvania or Virginia, or North-Carolina. Its operation contradicts that funda|mental maxim of republican government, which requires that the &s;en&s;e of the majority &s;hould prevail. Sophi&s;try may reply, that &s;overeigns are equal, and that a majority of the votes of the &s;tates will be a majority of confederated America. But this kind of
<PB N="136" REF="021127_0141_0FB2463E00B5FDD8">
logical legerdemain will never counteract the plain &s;ugge&s;tions of ju&s;tice and common &s;en&s;e. It may happen that this majority of &s;tates is a &s;mall minority of the people of America<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">New-Hamp&s;hire, Rhode-I&s;land, New-Jer&s;ey, Delaware, Georgia, South-Carolina and Maryland, are a majority of the whole number of the States, but they do not contain one third of the people.</NOTE>; and two thirds of the people of America, could not long be per&s;uaded, upon the credit of artificial di&s;tinctions and &s;yllogi&s;tic &s;ubtleties, to &s;ubmit their intere&s;ts to the manage|ment and di&s;po&s;al of one third. The larger &s;tates would after a while revolt from the idea of receiv|ing the law from the &s;maller. To acquie&s;ce in &s;uch a privation of their due importance in the political &s;cale, would be not merely to be in&s;en&s;ible to the love of power, but even to &s;acrifice the de&s;ire of equality. It is neither rational to expect the fir&s;t, nor ju&s;t to require the la&s;t&mdash;the &s;maller &s;tates con&s;i|dering how peculiarly their &s;afety and welfare depend on union, ought readily to renounce a pre|ten&s;ion; which, if not relinqui&s;hed would prove fatal to its duration.</P>
<P>It may be objected to this, that not &s;even but nine &s;tates, or two thirds of the whole number mu&s;t con&s;ent to the mo&s;t important re&s;olutions; and it may be thence infered, that nine &s;tates would always com|prehend a majority of the inhabitants of the union. But this does not obviate the impropriety of an equal vote between &s;tates of the mo&s;t unequal dimen&s;ions and populou&s;ne&s;s; nor is the inference accurate in point of fact; for we can enumerate nine &s;tates which contain le&s;s than a majority of the people<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Add New-York and Connecticut to the foregoing &s;even; and they will &s;till be le&s;s than a majority.</NOTE>; and it is con&s;titutionally po&s;&s;ible, that the&s;e nine may give the vote. Be&s;ides there are matters of con&s;i|derable moment determinable by a bare majority; and there are others, concerning which doubts have been entertained, which if interpreted in favor of the
<PB N="137" REF="021127_0142_0FB2463F832319C0">
&s;ufficiency of a vote of &s;even &s;tates, would extend its operation to intere&s;ts of the fir&s;t magnitude. In addi|tion to this, it is to be ob&s;erved, that there is a proba|bility of an increa&s;e in the number of &s;tates, and no provi&s;ion for a proportional augmentation of the ratio of votes.</P>
<P>But this is not all; what at fir&s;t &s;ight may &s;eem a remedy, is in reality a poi&s;on. To give a minority a negative upon the majority (which is always the ca&s;e where more than a majority is requi&s;ite to a deci&s;ion) is in its tendency to &s;ubject the &s;en&s;e of the greater number to that of the le&s;&s;er number. Congre&s;s from the non attendance of a few &s;tates have been frequently in the &s;ituation of a Poli&s;h diet, where a &s;ingle VETO has been &s;ufficient to put a &s;top to all their movements. A &s;ixtieth part of the union, which is about the proportion of Delaware and Rhode-I&s;land, has &s;everal times been able to oppo&s;e an entire bar to its operations. This is one of tho&s;e refinements which in practice has an effect, the rever&s;e of what is expected from it in theory. The nece&s;&s;ity of unanimity in public bodies, or of &s;ome|thing approaching towards it, has been founded upon a &s;uppo&s;ition that it would contribute to &s;ecu|rity. But its real operation is to embarra&s;s the admi|ni&s;tration, to de&s;troy the energy of government, and to &s;ub&s;titute the plea&s;ure, caprice or artifices of an in&s;ignificant, turbulent or corrupt junto, to the regular deliberations and deci&s;ions of a re&s;pectable majority. In tho&s;e emergencies of a nation, in which the goodne&s;s or badne&s;s, the weakne&s;s or &s;trength of its government, is of the greate&s;t importance, there is commonly a nece&s;&s;ity for action. The public bu&s;ine&s;s mu&s;t in &s;ome way or other go forward. If a pertinacious minority can controul the opinion of a majority re&s;pecting the be&s;t mode of conducting it; the majority, in order that &s;omething may be done, mu&s;t conform to the views of the minority; and thus the &s;en&s;e of the &s;maller number will over rule that of
<PB N="138" REF="021127_0143_0FB2464825F1DE00">
the greater and give a tone to the national proceed|ings. Hence tedious delays&mdash;continual negotiation and intrigue&mdash;contemptible compromi&s;es of the public good. And yet in &s;uch a &s;y&s;tem, it is even happy when &s;uch compromi&s;es can take place: For upon &s;ome occa&s;ions, things will not admit of accommo|dation; and then the mea&s;ures of government mu&s;t be injuriou&s;ly &s;u&s;pended or fatally defeated. It is often, by the impracticability of obtaining the con|currence of the nece&s;&s;ary number of votes, kept in a &s;tate of inaction. Its &s;ituation mu&s;t always favour of weakne&s;s&mdash;&s;ometimes border upon anarchy.</P>
<P>It is not difficult to di&s;cover that a principle of this kind gives greater &s;cope to foreign corruption as well as to dome&s;tic faction, than that which permits the &s;en&s;e of the majority to decide; though the contrary of this has been pre&s;umed. The mi&s;take has pro|ceeded from not attending with due care to the mi&s;|chiefs that may be occa&s;ioned by ob&s;tructing the progre&s;s of government at certain critical &s;ea&s;ons. When the concurrence of a large number is required by the con&s;titution to the doing of any national act, we are apt to re&s;t &s;atisfied that all is &s;afe, becau&s;e nothing improper will be likely <HI>to be done</HI>; but we forget how much good may be prevented, and how much ill may be produced, by the power of hinder|ing that which is nece&s;&s;ary from being done, and of keeping affairs in the &s;ame unfavourable po&s;ture in which they may happen to &s;tand at particular periods.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e for in&s;tance we were engaged in a war, in conjunction with one foreign nation again&s;t another. Suppo&s;e the nece&s;&s;ity of our &s;ituation demanded peace, and the intere&s;t or ambition of our ally led him to &s;eek the pro&s;ecution of the war, with views that might ju&s;tify us in making &s;eparate terms. In &s;uch a &s;tate of things this ally of ours would evidently find it much ea&s;ier by his bribes and his intrigues to tie up the hands of government from making peace, where two thirds of all the votes were requi&s;ite to
<PB N="139" REF="021127_0144_0FB2464C2ACB2F58">
that object, than where a &s;imple majority would &s;uffice. In the fir&s;t ca&s;e he would have to corrupt a &s;maller number; in the la&s;t a greater number. Upon the &s;ame principle it would be much ea&s;ier for a foreign power with which we were at war, to perplex our councils and embarra&s;s our exertions. And in a commercial view we may be &s;ubjected to &s;imilar inconveniencies. A nation with which we might have a treaty of commerce, could with much greater facility prevent our forming a connection with her competitor in trade; though &s;uch a connection &s;hould be ever &s;o beneficial to our&s;elves.</P>
<P>Evils of this di&s;cription ought not to be regarded as imaginary. One of the weak &s;ides of republics, among their numerous advantages, is, that they afford too ea&s;y an inlet to foreign corruption. An heredi|tary monarch, though often di&s;po&s;ed to &s;acrifice his &s;ubjects to his ambition, has &s;o great a per&s;onal intere&s;t in the government, and in the external glory of the nation, that it is not ea&s;y for a foreign power to give him an equivalent for what he would &s;acrifice by treachery to the &s;tate. The world has accordingly been witne&s;s to few examples of this &s;pecies of royal pro&s;titution, though there have been abundant &s;peci|mens of every other kind.</P>
<P>In republics, per&s;ons elevated from the ma&s;s of the community, by the &s;uffrages of their fellow citizens, to &s;tations of great pre-eminence and power, may find compen&s;ations for betraying their tru&s;t, which to any but minds actuated by &s;uperior virtue may appear to exceed the proportion of intere&s;t they have in the common &s;tock, and to over-balance the obligations of duty. Hence it is that hi&s;tory furni&s;hes us with &s;o many mortifying examples of the prevalency of foreign corruption in republican governments. How much this contributed to the ruin of the ancient commonwealths has been already di&s;clo&s;ed. It is well known that the deputies of the United Provinces have, in various in&s;tances been purcha&s;ed by the
<PB N="140" REF="021127_0145_0FB24654F01710D0">
emi&s;&s;aries of the neighbouring kingdoms. The ea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> of Che&s;terfield (if my memory &s;erves me right) in a letter to his court, intimates that his &s;ucce&s;s in an important negotiation, mu&s;t depend on his obtaining a major's commi&s;&s;ion for one of tho&s;e deputies. And in Sweden, the parties were alternately bought by France and England, in &s;o barefaced and notorious a manner that it excited univer&s;al di&s;gu&s;t in the nation; and was a principal cau&s;e that the mo&s;t limited monarch in Europe, in a &s;ingle day, without tumult, violence, or oppo&s;ition, became one of the mo&s;t ab&s;olute and uncontrouled.</P>
<P>A circum&s;tance, which crowns the defects of the confederation, remains yet to be mentioned&mdash;the want of a judiciary power. Laws are a dead letter with|out courts to expound and define their true meaning and operation. The treaties of the United States, to have any force at all, mu&s;t be con&s;idered as part of the law of the land. Their true import, as far as re|&s;p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cts individuals, mu&s;t, like all other laws, be a&s;cer|tained by judicial determinations. To produce uni|formity in the&s;e determinations, they ought to be &s;ubmitted in the la&s;t re&s;ort, to one SUPREME TRI|BUNAL. And this tribunal ought to be in&s;tituted under the &s;ame authority which forms the treaties them&s;elves. The&s;e ingredients are both indi&s;pen&s;ible. If there is in each &s;tate a court of final juri&s;diction, there may be as many different final determinations on the &s;ame point, as there are courts. There are endle&s;s diver&s;ities in the opinions of men. We often &s;ee not only different courts, but the judges of the &s;ame court differing from each other. To avoid the confu&s;ion which would unavoidably re&s;ult from the contradictory deci&s;ions of a number of indepen|dent judicatories, all nations have found it nece&s;&s;ary to e&s;tabli&s;h one court paramount to the re&s;t, po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ing a general &s;uperintendance, and authori&s;ed to &s;ettle and declare in the la&s;t re&s;ort an uniform rule of civil ju&s;tice.</P>
<P><PB N="141" REF="021127_0146_0FB24655F581A5A8">This is the more nece&s;&s;ary where the frame of the government is &s;o compounded, that the laws of the whole are in danger of being contravened by the laws of the parts. In this ca&s;e, if the particular tribunals are inve&s;ted with a right of ultimate juri&s;diction, be|&s;ides the contradictions to be expected from difference of opinion, there will be much to fear from the bias of local views and prejudices, and from the inter|ference of local regulations. As often as &s;uch an interference was to happen, there would be rea&s;on to apprehend, that the provi&s;ions of the particular laws might be preferred to tho&s;e of the general laws; from the deference with which men in office naturally look up to that authority to which they owe their official exi&s;tence. The treaties of the United States, under the pre&s;ent con&s;titution, are liable to the infrac|tions of thirteen different legi&s;latures, and as many different courts of final juri&s;diction, acting under the authority of tho&s;e legi&s;latures. The faith, the repu|tation, the peace of the whole union, are thus con|tinually at the mercy of the prejudices, the pa&s;&s;ions, and the intere&s;ts of every member of which it is com|po&s;ed. Is it po&s;&s;ible that foreign nations can either re&s;pect or confide in &s;uch a government? Is it po&s;&s;ible that the people of America will longer con&s;ent to tru&s;t their honor, their happine&s;s, their &s;afety, on &s;o pre|carious a foundation?</P>
<P>In this review of the confederation, I have confined my&s;elf to the exhibition of its mo&s;t material defects; pa&s;&s;ing over tho&s;e imperfections in its details, by which even a con&s;iderable part of the power intended to be conferred upon it, has been in a great mea&s;ure rendered abortive. It mu&s;t be by this time evident to all men of reflection, who are either free from erronious prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions or can dive&s;t them&s;elves of them, that it is a &s;y&s;tem &s;o radically vicious and un&s;ound, as to admit not of amendment but by an entire change in its leading features and characters.</P>

<HEAD>NUMBER XXIII. The nece&s;&s;ity of a Government, at lea&s;t equally energetic with the one propo&s;ed.</HEAD>
<P>THE nece&s;&s;ity of a con&s;titution, at lea&s;t equally energetic with the one propo&s;ed, to the pre&s;er|vation of the union, is the point, at the examination of which we are now arrived.</P>
<P>This inquiry will naturally divide it&s;elf into three branches&mdash;the objects to be provided for by a federal government&mdash;the quantity of power nece&s;&s;ary to the accompli&s;hment of tho&s;e objects&mdash;the per&s;ons upon whom that power ought to operate. Its di&s;tribution and organi&s;ation will more properly claim our atten|tion under the &s;ucceeding head.</P>
<P>The principal purpo&s;es to be an&s;wered by union are the&s;e&mdash;the common defence of the members&mdash;the pre&s;ervation of the public peace as well again&s;t internal convul&s;ions as external attacks&mdash;the regulation of commerce with other nations and between the &s;tates&mdash;the &s;uperintendence of our intercour&s;e poli|tical and commercial with foreign countries.</P>
<P><PB N="144" REF="021127_0149_0FB24666D0B67528">The authorities e&s;&s;ential to the care of the common defence are the&s;e&mdash;to rai&s;e armies&mdash;to build and equip fleets&mdash;to pre&s;cribe rules for the government of both &mdash;to direct their operations&mdash;to provide for their &s;upport. The&s;e powers ought to exi&s;t without limi|tation: Becau&s;e it is impo&s;&s;ible to fore&s;ee or to define the extent and variety of national exigencies, and the corre&s;pondent extent and variety of the means which may be nece&s;&s;ary to &s;atisfy them. The circum&s;tances that endanger the &s;afety of nations are infinite; and for this rea&s;on, no con&s;titutional &s;hackles can wi&s;ely be impo&s;ed on the power to which the care of it is com|mitted. This power ought to be coexten&s;ive with all the po&s;&s;ible combinations of &s;uch circum&s;tances; and ought to be under the direction of the &s;ame councils, which are appointed to pre&s;ide over the common defence.</P>
<P>This is one of tho&s;e truths which to a correct and unprejudiced mind carries its own evidence along with it; and may be ob&s;cured, but cannot be made plainer by argument or rea&s;oning. It re&s;ts upon axioms as &s;imple as they are univer&s;al&mdash;the <HI>means</HI> ought to be proportioned to the <HI>end</HI>;&mdash;the per&s;ons from who&s;e agency the attainment of any <HI>end</HI> is expected, ought to po&s;&s;e&s;s the <HI>means</HI> by which it is to be attained.</P>
<P>Whether there ought to be a federal government intru&s;ted with the care of the common defence is a que&s;tion, in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, open to di&s;cu&s;&s;ion; but the moment it is decided in the affirmative, it will follow, that that government ought to be cloathed with all the powers requi&s;ite to the complete exe|cution of its tru&s;t. And unle&s;s it can be &s;hewn, that the circum&s;tances which may affect the public &s;afety are reducible within certain determinate limits; unle&s;s the contrary of this po&s;ition can be fairly and rationally di&s;puted, it mu&s;t be admitted as a nece&s;|&s;ary con&s;equence, that there can be no limitation of that authority, which is to provide for the defence
<PB N="145" REF="021127_0150_0FB2466BACBA16A8">
and protection of the community, in any matter e&s;&s;ential to its efficacy; that is in any matter e&s;&s;en|tial to the <HI>formation, direction</HI> or <HI>&s;upport</HI> of the NATIONAL FORCES.</P>
<P>Defective as the pre&s;ent confederation has been proved to be, this principle appears to have been fully recogni&s;ed by the framers of it; though they have not made proper or adequate provi&s;ion for its exerci&s;e. Congre&s;s have an unlimited di&s;cretion to make requi&s;itions of men and money&mdash;to govern the army and navy&mdash;to direct their operations. As their requi&s;itions are made con&s;titutionally binding upon the &s;tates, who are in fact under the mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t &s;olemn obligations to furni&s;h the &s;upplies required of them, the intention evidently was, that the United States &s;hould command whatever re&s;ources were by them judged requi&s;ite to the
<Q>common defence and general welfare.</Q>
It was pre&s;umed that a &s;en&s;e of their true intere&s;ts and a regard to the dictates of good faith would be found &s;ufficient pledges for the punctual performance of the duty of the members to the federal head.</P>
<P>The experiment has however demon&s;trated, that this expectation was ill founded and illu&s;ory; and the ob&s;ervations made under the la&s;t head will, I imagine, have &s;ufficed to convince the impartial and di&s;cerning, that there is an ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity for an entire change in the fir&s;t principles of the &s;y&s;tem: That if we are in earne&s;t about giving the union energy and duration, we mu&s;t abandon the vain project of le|gi&s;lating upon the &s;tates in their collective capacities; we mu&s;t extend the laws of the federal government to the individual citizens of America; we mu&s;t di&s;|card the fallacious &s;cheme of quotas and requi&s;itions, as equally impracticable and unju&s;t. The re&s;ult from all this is, that the union ought to be inve&s;ted with full power to levy troops&mdash;to build and equip fleets and to rai&s;e the revenues which will be required for the formation and &s;upport of an army and navy,
<PB N="146" REF="021127_0151_0FB2467760B02A00">
in the cu&s;tomary and ordinary modes practiced in other governments.</P>
<P>If the circum&s;tances of our country are &s;uch, as to demand a compound in&s;tead of a &s;imple, a confe|derate in&s;tead of a &s;ole government, the e&s;&s;ential point which will remain to be adju&s;ted, will be to di&s;criminate the OBJECTS, as far as it can be done, which &s;hall appertain to the different provinces or departments of power; allowing to each the mo&s;t ample authority for fulfilling THOSE which may be committed to its charge. Shall the union be con&s;ti|tuted the guardian of the common &s;afety? Are fleets and armies and revenues nece&s;&s;ary to this purpo&s;e? The government of the union mu&s;t be impowered to pa&s;s all laws, and to make all regulations which have relation to them. The &s;ame mu&s;t be the ca&s;e, in re&s;pect to commerce, and to every other matter to which its juri&s;diction is permitted to extend. Is the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice between the citizens of the &s;ame &s;tate, the proper department of the local governments? The&s;e mu&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;s all the authorities which are connected with this object, and with every other that may be allotted to their particular cogni|zance and direction. Not to confer in each ca&s;e a degree of power, commen&s;urate to the end, would be to violate the mo&s;t obvious rules of prudence and propriety, and improvidently to tru&s;t the great intere&s;ts of the nation to hands, which are di&s;abled from managing them with vigour and &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>Who &s;o likely to make &s;uitable provi&s;ions for the public defence, as that body to which the guardian|&s;hip of the public &s;afety is confided&mdash;which, as the centre of information, will be&s;t under&s;tand the extent and urgency of the dangers that threaten&mdash;as the repre&s;entative of the WHOLE will feel it&s;elf mo&s;t deeply intere&s;ted in the pre&s;ervation of every part&mdash; which, from the re&s;pon&s;ibility implied in the duty a&s;&s;igned to it, will be mo&s;t &s;en&s;ibly impre&s;&s;ed with the nece&s;&s;ity of proper exertions&mdash;and which, by the

exten&s;ion of its authority throughout the &s;tates can alone e&s;tabli&s;h uniformity and concert in the plans and mea&s;ures, by which the common &s;afety is to be &s;ecured?

<P>Every view we may take of the &s;ubject, as candid in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">uiri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s after truth, will &s;erve to convince us, that it is both unwi&s;e and dangerous to deny the federal government an unconfined authority in re&s;pect to all tho&s;e objects which are intru&s;ted to its management. It will indeed de&s;erve the mo&s;t vigilant and careful attention of the people to &s;ee, that it be modelled in &s;uch a manner as to admit of its being &s;afely ve&s;ted with the requi&s;ite powers. If any plan, which has been, or may be offered to our con&s;ideration &s;hould not upon a di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate in&s;pection be found to an&s;wer this de&s;cription, it ought to be rejected. A govern|ment, the con&s;titution of which renders it unfit to be tru&s;ted with all the powers which a free people <HI>ought to delegate to any government,</HI> would be an un&s;afe and improper depo&s;itory of the NATIONAL INTERESTS. Wherever THESE can with propriety be confided, the coincident powers may &s;afely ac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ompany them. This is the true re&s;ult of all ju&s;t rea&s;oning upon the &s;ubject. And the adver&s;aries of the plan, promulgated by the convention, would have given a better impre&s;&s;ion of their candour, if they had confined them&s;elves to &s;howing that the internal &s;tructure of the propo&s;ed government, was &s;uch as to render it unworthy of
<PB N="148" REF="021127_0153_0FB2467C2F062988">
the confidence of the people. They ought not to have wandered into inflammatory declamations and unmeaning cavils about the extent of the powers. The POWERS are not too exten&s;ive for the OBJECTS of federal admini&s;tration, or in other words for the management of our NATIONAL INTERESTS; nor can any &s;atisfactory argument be framed to &s;how that they are chargeable with &s;uch an exce&s;s. If it be true, as has been in&s;inuated by &s;ome of the writers on the other &s;ide, that the difficulty ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;es from the nature of the thing, and that the extent of the country will not permit us to form a government, in which &s;uch ample powers can &s;afely be repo&s;ed, it would prove that we ought to contract our views and re&s;ort to the expedient of &s;eparate confederacies, which will move within more practicable &s;pheres. For the ab&s;urdity mu&s;t continually &s;tare us in the face of confiding to a government the direction of the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential national intere&s;ts, without daring to tru&s;t it with the authorities which are indi&s;pen&s;able to their proper and efficient management. Let us not attempt to reconcile contradictions, but firmly embrace a rational alternative.</P>
<P>I tru&s;t, however, that the impracticability of one general &s;y&s;tem cannot be &s;hewn. I am greatly mi&s;|taken if any thing of weight has yet been advanced of this tendency; and I flatter my&s;elf, that the ob&s;er|vations, which have been made in the cour&s;e of the&s;e papers, have &s;erved to place the rever&s;e of that po&s;i|tion in as clear a light as any matter &s;till in the womb of time and experience can be &s;u&s;ceptible of. This at all events mu&s;t be evident, that the very difficulty it&s;elf, drawn from the extent of the country is the &s;tronge&s;t argument in favor of an energetic government; for any other can certainly never pre|&s;erve the union of &s;o large an empire. If we embrace the tenets of tho&s;e, who oppo&s;e the adoption of the propo&s;ed con&s;titution, as the &s;tandard of our poli|tical creed, we cannot fail to verify the gloomy

<HEAD>NUMBER XXIV. The Subject continued, with an An&s;wer to an Objection concerning &s;tanding Armies.</HEAD>
<P>TO the powers propo&s;ed to be conferred upon the federal government in re&s;pect to the creation and direction of the national forces&mdash;I have met with but one &s;pecific objection; which if I under&s;tand it right is this&mdash;that proper provi&s;ion has not been made again&s;t the exi&s;tence of &s;tanding armies in time of peace: An objection which I &s;hall now endeavour to &s;hew, re&s;ts on weak and un&s;ub&s;tantial foundations.</P>
<P>It has indeed been brought forward in the mo&s;t vague and general form, &s;upported only by bold a&s;&s;ertions, without the appearance of argument&mdash; without even the &s;anction of theoretical opinions, in contradiction to the practice of other free nations, and to the general &s;en&s;e of America, as expre&s;&s;ed in mo&s;t of the exi&s;ting con&s;titutions. The propriety of this remark will appear the moment it is recollected that the objection under con&s;ideration turns upon a &s;uppo&s;ed nece&s;&s;ity of re&s;training the LEGISLATIVE authority of the nation, in the article of military e&s;tabli&s;hments; a principle unheard of except in one or two of our &s;tate con&s;titutions, and rejected in all the re&s;t.</P>
<P>A &s;tranger to our politics who was to read our new&s;papers at the pre&s;ent juncture, without having previou&s;ly in&s;pected the plan reported by the con|vention, would be naturally led to one of two conclu|&s;ions&mdash;either that it contained a po&s;itive injunction,
<PB N="150" REF="021127_0155_0FB24680AE33A6E8">
that &s;tanding armies &s;hould be kept up in time of peace, or that it ve&s;ted in the EXECUTIVE the whole power of levying troops, without &s;ubjecting his di&s;cre|tion in any &s;hape to the controul of the legi&s;lature.</P>
<P>If he came afterwards to peru&s;e the plan it&s;elf, he would be &s;urpri&s;ed to di&s;cover that neither the one nor the other was the ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e&mdash;that the whole power of rai&s;ing armies was lodged in the <HI>legi&s;lature,</HI> not in the <HI>executive</HI>; that this legi&s;lature was to be a popular body con&s;i&s;ting of the repre&s;entatives of the people periodically elected&mdash;and that in&s;tead of the provi&s;ion he had &s;uppo&s;ed in favor of &s;tanding armies, there was to be found in re&s;pect to this object, an important qualification even of the legi&s;lative di&s;|cretion, in that clau&s;e which forbids the appropri|ation of money for the &s;upport of an army for any longer period than two years: A precaution which, upon a nearer view of it, will appear to be a great and real &s;ecurity again&s;t military e&s;tabli&s;hments without evident nece&s;&s;ity.</P>
<P>Di&s;appointed in his fir&s;t &s;urmi&s;e, the per&s;on I have &s;uppo&s;ed would be apt to pur&s;ue his conjectures a little further.

This is in truth rather a CAUTION than a PROHIBITION. New-Hamp&s;hire, Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, Dela|ware and Maryland, have in each of their bills of rights a clau&s;e to this effect&mdash;

which is a formal admi&s;&s;ion of the authority of the legi&s;lature. New-York has no bill of her rights, and her con&s;titution &s;ays not a word about the matter. No bills of rights appear annexed to the con&s;titutions of the other &s;tates except the foregoing, and their con&s;titutions are equally &s;ilent. I am told, however, that one or two &s;tates have bills of rights, which do not appear in this collection; but that tho&s;e al&s;o recog|nize the right of the legi&s;lative authority in this re&s;pect.</NOTE> contained an interdiction of &s;tanding armies

in time of peace; that the other eleven&punc; had either ob&s;erved a profound &s;ilence on the &s;ubject, or had in expre&s;s terms admitted the right of the legi&s;lature to authori&s;e their exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>Still however he would be per&s;uaded that there mu&s;t be &s;ome plau&s;ible foundation for the cry rai&s;ed on this head. He would never be able to imagine, while any &s;ource of information remained unexplored, that it was nothing more than an experiment upon the public credulity, dictated either by a deliberate intention to deceive or by the overflowings of a zeal too intemperate to be ingenuous. It would probably occur to him that he would be likely to find the pre|cautions he was in &s;earch of in the primitive compact between the &s;tates. Here at length he would expect to meet with a &s;olution of the enigma. No doubt he would ob&s;erve to him&s;elf the exi&s;ting confederation mu&s;t contain the mo&s;t explicit provi&s;ions again&s;t military e&s;tabli&s;hments in time of peace; and a departure from this model in a favorite point has occa&s;ioned the di&s;content which appears to influence the&s;e political champions.</P>
<P>If he &s;hould now apply him&s;elf to a careful and critical &s;urvey of the articles of confederation, his a&s;toni&s;hment would not only be increa&s;ed but would acquire a mixture of indignation at the unexpected di&s;covery that the&s;e articles in&s;tead of containing the prohibition he looked for, and though they had with jealous circum&s;pection re&s;tricted the authority of the
<PB N="152" REF="021127_0157_0FB2468B28004F88">
&s;tate legi&s;latures in this particular, had not impo&s;ed a &s;ingle re&s;traint on that of the United States. If he happened to be a man of quick &s;en&s;ibility or ardent temper, he could now no longer refrain from pro|nouncing the&s;e clamours to be the di&s;hone&s;t artifices of a &s;ini&s;ter and unprincipled oppo&s;ition to a plan which ought at lea&s;t to receive a fair and candid examination from all &s;incere lovers of their country! How el&s;e, he would &s;ay, could the authors of them have been tempted to vent &s;uch loud cen&s;ures upon that plan, about a point in which it &s;eems to have conformed it&s;elf to the general &s;en&s;e of America as declared in its different forms of government, and in which it has even &s;uperadded a new and powerful guard unknown to any of them? If on the contrary he happened to be a man of calm and di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate feelings&mdash;he would indulge a &s;igh for the frailty of human nature, and would lament that in a matter &s;o intere&s;ting to the happine&s;s of milions the true merits of the que&s;tion &s;hould be perplexed and ob&s;cured by expedients &s;o unfriendly to an impartial and right determination. Even &s;uch a man could hardly forbear remarking that a conduct of this kind has too much the appearance of an intention to mi&s;lead the people by alarming their pa&s;&s;ions rather than to convince them by arguments addre&s;&s;ed to their under&s;tandings.</P>
<P>But however little this objection may be counte|nanced even by precedents among our&s;elves, it may be &s;atisfactory to take a nearer view of its intrin&s;ic merits. From a clo&s;e examination it will appear, that re&s;traints upon the di&s;cretion of the legi&s;lature in re&s;pect to military e&s;tabli&s;hments would be improper to be impo&s;ed, and if impo&s;ed, from the nece&s;&s;ities of &s;ociety, would be unlikely to be ob&s;erved.</P>
<P>Though a wide ocean &s;eparates the United States from Europe; yet there are various con&s;iderations that warn us again&s;t an exce&s;s of confidence or &s;ecu|rity. On one &s;ide of us and &s;tretching far into our rear are growing &s;ettlements &s;ubject to the dominion
<PB N="153" REF="021127_0158_0FB2469C437E8030">
of Britain. On the other &s;ide and extending to meet the Briti&s;h &s;ettlements are colonies and e&s;tabli&s;hments &s;ubject to the dominion of Spain. This &s;ituation and the vicinity of the We&s;t-India i&s;lands belonging to the&s;e two powers create between them, in re&s;pect to their American po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and in relation to us a common intere&s;t. The &s;avage tribes on our We&s;tern frontier ought to be regarded as our natural enemies their natural allies; becau&s;e they have mo&s;t to fear from us and mo&s;t to hope from them. The improve|ments in the art of navigation have, as to the facility of communication, rendered di&s;tant nations in a great mea&s;ure neighbours. Britain and Spain are among the principal maritime powers of Europe. A future concert of views between the&s;e nations ought not to be regarded as improbable. The increa&s;ing remote|ne&s;s of con&s;anguinity is every day dimini&s;hing the force of the family compact between France and Spain. And politicians have ever with great rea&s;on con&s;idered the ties of blood as feeble and preca|rious links of political connection. The&s;e circum|&s;tances combined admoni&s;h us not to be too &s;anguine in con&s;idering our&s;elves as intirely out of the reach of danger.</P>
<P>Previous to the revolution, and ever &s;ince the peace, there has been a con&s;tant nece&s;&s;ity for keeping &s;mall garri&s;ons on our We&s;tern frontier. No per&s;on can doubt that the&s;e will continue to be indi&s;pen&s;able, if it &s;hould only be again&s;t the ravages and depre|dations of the Indians. The&s;e garri&s;ons mu&s;t either be furni&s;hed, by occa&s;ional detachments from the militia, or by permanent corps in the pay of the government. The fir&s;t is impracticable; and if practicable, would be pernicious. The militia would not long, if at all, &s;ubmit to be dragged from their occupations and families to perform that mo&s;t di&s;agreeable duty in times of profound peace. And if they could be prevailed upon, or compelled to do it, the increa&s;ed expence of a frequent rotation of
<PB N="154" REF="021127_0159_0FB2469D2A7AD120">
&s;ervice, and the lo&s;s of labour and di&s;concertion of the indu&s;trious pur&s;uits of individuals, would form conclu&s;ive objections to the &s;cheme. It would be as burthen&s;ome and injurious to the public, as ruinous to private citizens. The latter re&s;ource of permanent corps in the pay of government amounts to a &s;tand|ing army in time of peace; a &s;mall one indeed, but not the le&s;s real for being &s;mall. Here is a &s;imple view of the &s;ubject that &s;hows us at once the impro|priety of a con&s;titutional interdiction of &s;uch e&s;ta|bli&s;hments, and the nece&s;&s;ity of leaving the matter to the di&s;cretion and prudence of the legi&s;lature.</P>
<P>In proportion to our increa&s;e in &s;trength it is pro|bable, nay it may be &s;aid certain, that Britain and Spain would augment their military e&s;tabli&s;hments in our neighbourhood. If we &s;hould not be willing to be expo&s;ed in a naked and defencele&s;s condition to their in&s;ults or encroachments, we &s;hould find it expedient to increa&s;e our frontier garri&s;ons in &s;ome ratio to the force by which our We&s;tern &s;ettlements might be annoyed. There are and will be parti|cular po&s;ts, the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of which will include the command of large di&s;tricts of territory and facilitate future inva&s;ions of the remainder. It may be added that &s;ome of tho&s;e po&s;ts will be keys to the trade with the Indian nations. Can any man think it would be wi&s;e to leave &s;uch po&s;ts in a &s;ituation to be at any in&s;tant &s;eized by one or the other of two neigh|bouring and formidable powers? To act this part, would be to de&s;ert all the u&s;ual maxims of prudence and policy.</P>
<P>If we mean to be a commercial people or even to be &s;ecure on our Atlantic &s;ide, we mu&s;t endeavour as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible to have a navy. To this purpo&s;e there mu&s;t be dock-yards and ar&s;enals; and, for the defence of the&s;e, fortifications and probably gar|ri&s;ons. When a nation has become &s;o powerful by &s;ea, that it can protect its dock-yards by its fleets, this &s;uper&s;edes the nece&s;&s;ity of garri&s;ons for that
<PB N="155" REF="021127_0160_0FB2469ECD5D8A10">
purpo&s;e; but where naval e&s;tabli&s;hments are in their infancy, moderate garri&s;ons will in all likelihood be found an indi&s;pen&s;able &s;ecurity again&s;t de&s;cents for the de&s;truction of the ar&s;enals and dock-yards and &s;ometimes of the fleet it&s;elf.</P>

<P>IT may perhaps be urged, that the objects enume|rated in the preceding number ought to be pro|vided for by the &s;tate governments, under the direc|tion of the union. But this would be an inver&s;ion of the primary principle of our political a&s;&s;ociation; as it would in practice transfer the care of the common defence from the federal head to the individual members: A project oppre&s;&s;ive to &s;ome &s;tates, dan|gerous to all, and baneful to the confederacy.</P>
<P>The territories of Britain, Spain and of the Indian nations in our neighbourhood, do not border on par|ticular &s;tates; but incircle the union from MAINE to GEORGIA. The danger, though in different degrees, is therefore common. And the means of guarding again&s;t it ought in like manner to be the objects of common councils and of a common trea&s;ury. It happens that &s;ome &s;tates, from local &s;ituation, are more directly expo&s;ed. NEW-YORK is of this cla&s;s. Upon the plan of &s;eparate provi&s;ions, New-York would have to &s;u&s;tain the whole weight of the e&s;tabli&s;hments requi&s;ite to her immediate &s;afety, and to the mediate or ultimate protection of her neighbours. This would neither be equitable as it re&s;pected New-York, nor &s;afe as it re&s;pected the other &s;tates. Various inconveniencies would attend &s;uch a &s;y&s;tem. The &s;tates, to who&s;e lot it might fall
<PB N="156" REF="021127_0161_0FB246A04ABED6D8">
to &s;upport the nece&s;&s;ary e&s;tabli&s;hments, would be as little able as willing, for a con&s;iderable time to come, to bear the burthen of competent provi&s;ions. The &s;ecurity of all would thus be &s;ubjected to the par&s;i|mony, improvidence or inability of a part. If the re&s;ources of &s;uch part becoming more abundant, its provi&s;ions &s;hould be proportionally enlarged, the other &s;tates would quickly take the alarm at &s;eeing the whole military force of the union in the hands of two or three of its members; and tho&s;e probably among&s;t the mo&s;t powerful. They would each choo&s;e to have &s;ome counterpoi&s;e; and pretences could ea&s;ily be contrived. In this &s;ituation military e&s;ta|bli&s;hments, nouri&s;hed by mutual jealou&s;y, would be apt to &s;well beyond their natural or proper &s;ize; and being at the &s;eparate di&s;po&s;al of the members, they would be engines for the abridgment, or demolition of the national authority.</P>
<P>Rea&s;ons have been already given to induce a &s;up|po&s;ition, that the &s;tate governments will too naturally be prone to a rival&s;hip with that of the union, the foundation of which will be the love of power; and that in any conte&s;t between the federal head and one of its members, the people will be mo&s;t apt to unite with their local government: If in addition to this immen&s;e advantage, the ambition of the members &s;hould be &s;timulated by the &s;eparate and independent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of military forces, it would afford too &s;trong a temptation, and too great facility to them to make enterpri&s;es upon, and finally to &s;ubvert the con&s;titutional authority of the union. On the other hand, the liberty of the people would be le&s;s &s;afe in this &s;tate of things, than in that which left the nati|onal forces in the hands of the national government. As far as an army may be con&s;idered as a dangerous weapon of power, it had better be in tho&s;e hands, of which the people are mo&s;t likely to be jealous, than in tho&s;e of which they are lea&s;t likely to be jealous. For it is a truth which the experience of all ages
<PB N="157" REF="021127_0162_0FB246A6D5CA6650">
has atte&s;ted, that the people are commonly mo&s;t in danger, when the means of injuring their rights are in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e of whom they entertain the lea&s;t &s;u&s;picion.</P>
<P>The framers of the exi&s;ting confederation, fully aware of the danger to the union from the &s;eparate po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of military forces by the &s;tates, have in expre&s;s terms, prohibited them from having either &s;hips or troops, unle&s;s with the con&s;ent of congre&s;s. The truth is, that the exi&s;tence of a federal govern|ment and military e&s;tabli&s;hments, under &s;tate autho|rity, are not le&s;s at variance with each other, than a due &s;upply of the federal trea&s;ury and the &s;y&s;tem of quotas and requi&s;itions.</P>
<P>There are other lights be&s;ides tho&s;e already taken notice of, in which the impropriety of re&s;traints on the di&s;cretion of the national legi&s;lature will be equally manife&s;t. The de&s;ign of the objection, which has been mentioned, is to preclude &s;tanding armies in time of peace; though we have never been informed how far it is de&s;ired the prohibition &s;hould extend; whether to rai&s;ing armies as well as to <HI>keeping them up</HI> in a &s;ea&s;on of tranquility or not. If it be confined to the latter it will have no preci&s;e &s;ignification, and it will be ineffectual for the purpo&s;e intended. When armies are once rai&s;ed, what &s;hall be denominated "keeping them up," contrary to the &s;en&s;e of the con&s;titution? What time &s;hall be requi&s;ite to a&s;certain the violation? Shall it be a week, a month, or a year? Or &s;hall we &s;ay, they may be continued as long as the danger which occa&s;ioned their being rai&s;ed continues? This would be to admit that they might be kept up <HI>in time of peace</HI> again&s;t threatening, or impending danger; which would be at once to deviate from the literal meaning of the prohibition, and to introduce an exten&s;ive latitude of con&s;truction. Who &s;hall judge of the continuance of the danger? This mu&s;t undoubtedly be &s;ubmitted to the national government, and the matter would then be brought
<PB N="158" REF="021127_0163_0FB246A7CC1E2858">
to this i&s;&s;ue, that the national government, to provide again&s;t apprehended danger, might, in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, rai&s;e troops, and might afterwards keep them on foot, as long as they &s;uppo&s;ed the peace or &s;afety of the community was in any degree of jeopardy. It is ea&s;y to perceive, that a di&s;cretion &s;o latitudinary as this, would afford ample room for eluding the force of the provi&s;ion.</P>
<P>The &s;uppo&s;ed utility of a provi&s;ion of this kind, mu&s;t be founded upon a &s;uppo&s;ed probability, or at lea&s;t po&s;&s;ibility, of a combination between the execu|tive and legi&s;lative in &s;ome &s;cheme of u&s;urpation. Should this at any time happen, how ea&s;y would it be to fabricate pretences of approaching danger? Indian ho&s;tilities in&s;tigated by Spain or Britain, would always be at hand. Provocations to produce the de&s;ired appearances, might even be given to &s;ome foreign power, and appea&s;ed again by timely con|ce&s;&s;ions. If we can rea&s;onably pre&s;ume &s;uch a combi|nation to have been formed, and that the enterpri&s;e is warranted by a &s;ufficient pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s; the army when once rai&s;ed, from whatever cau&s;e, or on whatever pretext, may be applied to the execution of the project.</P>
<P>If to obviate this con&s;equence, it &s;hould be re&s;olved to extend the prohibition to the <HI>rai&s;ing</HI> of armies in time of peace, the United States would then exhibit the mo&s;t extraordinary &s;pectacle, which the world has yet &s;een&mdash;that of a nation incapacitated by its con|&s;titution to prepare for defence, before it was actually invaded. As the ceremony of a formal denunciation of war has of late fallen into di&s;u&s;e, the pre&s;ence of an enemy within our territories mu&s;t be waited for as the legal warrant to the government to begin its levies of men for the protection of the &s;tate. We mu&s;t receive the blow before we could even prepare to return it. All that kind of policy by which nations anticipate di&s;tant danger, and meet the gathering &s;torm, mu&s;t be ab&s;tained from, as contrary to the
<PB N="159" REF="021127_0164_0FB246A92B0FC5F0">
genuine maxims of a free government. We mu&s;t expo&s;e our property and liberty to the mercy of foreign invaders and invite them, by our weakne&s;s, to &s;eize the naked and defencele&s;s prey, becau&s;e we are afraid that rulers, created by our choice&mdash;depen|dent on our will&mdash;might endanger that liberty, by an abu&s;e of the means nece&s;&s;ary to its pre&s;ervation.</P>
<P>Here I expect we &s;hall be told, that the militia of the country is its natural bulwark, and would be at all times equal to the national defence. This doctrine in &s;ub&s;tance had like to have lo&s;t us our independence. It co&s;t millions to the United States that might have been &s;aved. The facts, which from our own experience forbid a reliance of this kind, are too recent to permit us to be the dupes of &s;uch a &s;ugge&s;tion. The &s;teady operations of war again&s;t a regular and di&s;ciplined army, can only be &s;ucce&s;sfully conducted by a force of the &s;ame kind. Con&s;ide|rations of economy, not le&s;s than of &s;tability and vigor, confirm this po&s;ition. The American militia, in the cour&s;e of the late war, have by their valour on numerous occa&s;ions, erected eternal monuments to their fame; but the brave&s;t of them feel and know, that the liberty of their country could not have been e&s;tabli&s;hed by their efforts alone, however great and valuable they were. War, like mo&s;t other things, is a &s;cience to be acquired and perfected by diligence, by per&s;everance, by time, and by practice.</P>
<P>All violent policy, contrary to the natural and experienced cour&s;e of human affairs, defeats it&s;elf. Penn&s;ylvania at this in&s;tant affords an example of the truth of this remark. The bill of rights of that &s;tate declares, that &s;tanding armies are dangerous to liberty, and ought not to be kept up in time of peace. Penn&s;ylvania, neverthele&s;s, in a time of profound peace, from the exi&s;tence of partial di&s;orders in one or two of her counties, has re&s;olved to rai&s;e a body of troops; and in all probability, will keep them up as long as there is any appearance of danger to the
<PB N="160" REF="021127_0165_0FB246AB7A7F6720">
public peace. The conduct of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts affords a le&s;&s;on on the &s;ame &s;ubject, though on different ground. That &s;tate (without waiting for the &s;anc|tion of congre&s;s as the articles of the confederation require) was compelled to rai&s;e troops to quell a dome&s;tic in&s;urrection, and &s;till keeps a corps in pay to prevent a revival of the &s;pirit of revolt. The par|ticular con&s;titution of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts oppo&s;ed no ob&s;tacle to the mea&s;ure; but the in&s;tance is &s;till of u&s;e to in&s;truct us, that ca&s;es are likely to occur under our governments, as well as under tho&s;e of other nations, which will &s;ometimes render a military force in time of peace e&s;&s;ential to the &s;ecurity of the &s;ociety, and that it is therefore improper, in this re&s;pect, to controul the legi&s;lative di&s;cretion. It al&s;o teaches us, in its application to the United States, how little the rights of a feeble government are likely to be re&s;|pected, even by its own con&s;tituents. And it teaches us, in addition to the re&s;t, how unequal are parchment provi&s;ions to a &s;truggle with public nece&s;&s;ity.</P>
<P>It was a fundamental maxim of the Lacedemonian commonwealth, that the po&s;t of admiral &s;hould not be conferred twice on the &s;ame per&s;on. The Pelop|pone&s;ian confederates, having &s;uffered a &s;evere defeat at &s;ea from the Athenians, demanded Ly&s;ander who had before &s;erved with &s;ucce&s;s in that capacity, to command the combined fleets. The Lacedemo|nians, to gratify their allies, and yet pre&s;erve the &s;emblance of an adherence to their antient in&s;titutions had recour&s;e to the flim&s;y &s;ubterfuge of inve&s;ting Ly&s;ander with the real power of admiral, under the nominal title of vice-admiral. This in&s;tance is &s;elected from among a multitude that might be cited to confirm the truth already advanced and illu&s;trated by dome&s;tic examples; which is, that nations pay little regard to rules and maxims calculated in their very nature to run counter to the nece&s;&s;ities of &s;ociety. Wi&s;e politicians will be cautious about fettering the government with re&s;trictions, that cannot be ob&s;erved;

becau&s;e they know that every breach of the funda|mental laws, though dictated by nece&s;&s;ity impairs that &s;acred reverence, which ought to be maintained in the brea&s;t of rulers towards the con&s;titution of a country, and forms a precedent for other breaches, where the &s;ame plea of nece&s;&s;ity does not exi&s;t at all, or is le&s;s urgent and palpable.</P>

<P>IT was a thing hardly to be expected, that in a popular revolution the minds of men &s;hould &s;top, at that happy mean, which marks the &s;alutary boundary between POWER and PRIVILEGE, and combines the energy of government with the &s;ecurity of private rights. A failure in this delicate and important point is the great &s;ource of the inconveniences we experi|ence; and if we are not cautious to avoid a repetition of the error, in our future attempts to rectify and ame|liorate our &s;y&s;tem we may travel from one chimerical project to another; we may try change after change; but we &s;hall never be likely to make any material change for the better.</P>
<P>The idea of re&s;training the legi&s;lative authority, in the means of providing for the national defence, is one of tho&s;e refinements, which owe their origin to a zeal for liberty more ardent than enlightened. We have &s;een however that is has not had thus far an exten&s;ive prevalency: That even in this country, where it has made its fir&s;t appearance, Penn&s;ylvania and North-Carolina are the only two &s;tates by which it has been in any degree patroni&s;ed: And that all the others have refu&s;ed to give it the lea&s;t countenance; wi&s;ely judging that confidence mu&s;t be placed &s;ome
<PB N="162" REF="021127_0167_0FB246B5E63A9348">
where; that the nece&s;&s;ity of doing it is implied in the very act of delegating power; and that it is better to hazard the abu&s;e of that confidence, than to embarra&s;s the government and endanger the public &s;afety, by impolitic re&s;trictions on the legi&s;lative authority. The opponents of the propo&s;ed con&s;titution combat in this re&s;pect the general deci&s;ion of America; and in&s;tead of being taught by experience the propriety of cor|recting any extremes, into which we may have here|tofore run, they appear di&s;po&s;ed to conduct us into others &s;till more dangerous and more extravagant. As if the tone of government had been found too high, or too rigid, the doctrines they teach are calcu|lated to induce us to depre&s;s, or to relax it, by expe|dients which upon other occa&s;ions have been con|demned or forborn. It may be affirmed without the imputation of invective, that if the principles they inculcate on various points could &s;o far obtain as to become the popular creed, they would utterly unfit the people of this country for any &s;pecies of govern|ment whatever. But a danger of this kind is not to be apprehended. The citizens of America have too much di&s;cernment to be argued into anarchy. And I am much mi&s;taken if experience has not wrought a deep and &s;olemn conviction in the public mind, that greater energy of government is e&s;&s;ential to the welfare and pro&s;perity of the community.</P>
<P>It may not be ami&s;s in this place conci&s;ely to remark the origin and progre&s;s of the idea which aims at the exclu&s;ion of military e&s;tabli&s;hments in time of peace. Though in &s;peculative minds it may ari&s;e from a contemplation of the nature and tendency of &s;uch in&s;titutions fortified by the events that have happened in other ages and countries; yet as a national &s;enti|ment it mu&s;t be traced to tho&s;e habits of thinking which we derive from the nation from whom the inha|bitants of the&s;e &s;tates have in general &s;prung.</P>
<P>In England for a long time after the Norman con|que&s;t, the authority of the monarch was almo&s;t unli|mited.

Inroads were gradually made upon the prero|gative, in favour of liberty, fir&s;t by the barons and afterwards by the people, till the greate&s;t part of its mo&s;t formidable preten&s;ions became extinct. But it was not till the revolution in 1688, which elevated the prince of Orange to the throne of Great Britain, that Engli&s;h liberty was completely triumphant. As incident to the undefined power of making war, an acknowledged prerogative of the crown, Charles IId had by his own authority kept on foot in time of peace a body of 5,000 regular troops. And this number James IId. increa&s;ed to 30,000; which were paid out of his civil li&s;t. At the revolution, to aboli&s;h the exerci&s;e of &s;o dangerous an authority, it became an article of the bill of rights then framed, that
<Q>rai&s;ing or keeping a &s;tanding army within the kingdom in time of peace, <HI>unle&s;s with the con&s;ent of parliament,</HI> was again&s;t law.</Q></P>
<P>In that kingdom, when the pul&s;e of liberty was at its highe&s;t pitch, no &s;ecurity again&s;t the danger of &s;tanding armies was thought requi&s;ite, beyond a pro|hibition of their being rai&s;ed or kept up by the mere authority of the executive magi&s;trate. The patriots, who effected that memorable revolution, were too temperate and too well informed, to think of any re&s;traint on the legi&s;lative di&s;cretion. They were aware that a certain number of troops for guards and garri&s;ons were indi&s;pen&s;able, that no preci&s;e bounds could be &s;et to the national exigencies; that a power equal to every po&s;&s;ible contingency mu&s;t exi&s;t &s;ome|where in the government; and that when they referred the exerci&s;e of that power to the judgement of the legi&s;lature, they had arrived at the ultimate point of precaution, which was reconcileable with the &s;afety of the community.</P>

the public &s;en&s;ibility on every point connected with the &s;ecurity of popular rights; and in &s;ome in&s;tances rai&s;ed the warmth of our zeal beyond the degree which con&s;i&s;ted with the due temperature of the body politic. The attempts of two of the &s;tates to re&s;trict the authority of the legi&s;lature in the article of mili|tary e&s;tabli&s;hments are of the number of the&s;e in|&s;tances. The principles, which had taught us to be jealous of the power of a hereditary monarch, were by an injudicious exce&s;s extended to the repre&s;en|tatives of the people in their popular a&s;&s;emblies. Even in &s;ome of the &s;tates, where this error was not adopted, we find unnece&s;&s;ary declarations, that &s;tand|ing armies ought not to be kept up, in time of peace, <HI>without the con&s;ent of the legi&s;lature</HI>;&mdash;I call them unnece&s;&s;ary, becau&s;e the rea&s;on, which had introduced a &s;imilar provi&s;ion into the Engli&s;h bill of rights, is not applicable to any of the &s;tate con&s;titutions. The power of rai&s;ing armies at all, under tho&s;e con&s;ti|tutions, can by no con&s;truction be deemed to re&s;ide any where el&s;e, than in the legi&s;latures them&s;elves; and it was &s;uperflous, if not ab&s;urd, to declare that a matter &s;hould not be done without the con&s;ent of a body, which alone had the power of doing it. Accordingly in &s;ome of tho&s;e con&s;titutions, and among others in that of the &s;tate of New-York; which has been ju&s;tly celebrated both in Europe and in America as one of the be&s;t of the forms of govern|ment e&s;tabli&s;hed in this country, there is a total &s;ilence upon the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>It is remarkable, that even in the two &s;tates, which &s;eem to have meditated an interdiction of military e&s;tabli&s;hments in time of peace, the mode of expre&s;&s;ion made u&s;e of is rather monitory than prohibitory. It is not &s;aid, that &s;tanding armies <HI>&s;hall not be</HI> kept up, but that they <HI>ought not</HI> to be kept up in time of peace. This ambiguity of terms appears to have been the re&s;ult of a conflict between jealou&s;y and conviction, between the de&s;ire of excluding &s;uch e&s;tabli&s;hments

at all events, and the per&s;ua&s;ion that an ab&s;olute exclu&s;ion would be unwi&s;e and un&s;afe.</P>
<P>Can it be doubted that &s;uch a provi&s;ion, whenever the &s;ituation of public affairs was under&s;tood to require a departure from it, would be interpreted by the legi&s;|lature into a mere admonition, and would be made to yield to the nece&s;&s;ities or &s;uppo&s;ed nece&s;&s;ities of the &s;tate? Let the fact already mentioned with re&s;pect to Penn&s;ylvania decide. What then (it may be a&s;ked) is the u&s;e of &s;uch a provi&s;ion, if it cea&s;e to operate the moment there is an inclination to di&s;regard it?</P>
<P>Let us examine whether there be any compari&s;on, in point of efficacy, between the provi&s;ion alluded to, and that which is contained in the new con&s;titution, for re&s;training the appropriations of money for mili|tary purpo&s;es to the period of two years. The former by aiming at too much, is calculated to effect nothing; the latter, by &s;teering clear of an imprudent extreme, and by being perfectly compatible with a proper pro|vi&s;ion for the exigencies of the nation, will have a &s;alutary and powerful operation.</P>
<P>The legi&s;lature of the United States will be <HI>obliged</HI> by this provi&s;ion, once at lea&s;t in every two years, to deliberate upon the propriety of keeping a military force on foot; to come to a new re&s;olution on the point; and to declare their &s;en&s;e of the matter, by a formal vote in the face of their con&s;tituents. They are not <HI>at liberty</HI> to ve&s;t in the executive department permanent funds for the &s;upport of an army; if they were even incautious enough to be willing to repo&s;e in it &s;o improper a confidence. As the &s;pirit of party, in different degrees, mu&s;t be expected to infect all political bodies, there will be no doubt per&s;ons in the national legi&s;lature willing enough to arraign the mea&s;ures and criminate the views of the majority. The provi&s;ion for the &s;upport of a military force will always be a favourable topic for declamation. As often as the que&s;tion comes forward, the public atten|tion will be rou&s;ed and attracted to the &s;ubject, by
<PB N="166" REF="021127_0171_0FB246CB1F355588">
the party in oppo&s;ition: And if the majority &s;hould be really di&s;po&s;ed to exceed the proper limits, the community will be warned of the danger, and will have an opportunity of taking mea&s;ures to guard again&s;t it. Independent of parties in the national legi&s;lature it&s;elf, as often as the period of di&s;cu&s;&s;ion arrived, the &s;tate legi&s;latures, who will always be not only vigilant, but &s;u&s;picious and jealous guardians of the rights of the citizens, again&s;t incroachments from the federal government, will con&s;tantly have their attention awake to the conduct of the national rulers, and will be ready enough, if any thing improper appears, to &s;ound the alarm to the people, and not only to be the VOICE, but, if nece&s;&s;ary, the ARM of their di&s;content.</P>
<P>Schemes to &s;ubvert the liberties of a great commu|nity <HI>require time to</HI> mature them for execution. An army &s;o large as &s;eriou&s;ly to menace tho&s;e liberties, could only be formed by progre&s;&s;ive augmentations; which would &s;uppo&s;e not merely a temporary combi|nation between the legi&s;lature and executive, but a continued con&s;piracy for a &s;eries of time. Is it pro|bable that &s;uch a combination would exi&s;t at all? Is it probable that it would be per&s;evered in, and tran&s;|mitted along, through all the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive variations in the repre&s;entative body, which biennial elections would naturally produce in both hou&s;es? Is it pre|&s;umable, that every man, the in&s;tant he took his &s;eat in the national &s;enate, or hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives, would commence a traitor to his con&s;tituents, and to his country? Can it be &s;uppo&s;ed, that there would not be found one man di&s;cerning enough to detect &s;o atrocious a con&s;piracy, or bold or hone&s;t enough to appri&s;e his con&s;tituents of their danger? If &s;uch pre|&s;umptions can fairly be made, there ought to be at once an end of all delegated authority. The people &s;hould re&s;olve to recall all the powers they have here|tofore parted with out of their own hands; and to divide them&s;elves into as many &s;tates as there are
<PB N="167" REF="021127_0172_0FB246CC6D452068">
counties in order that they may be able to manage their own concerns in per&s;on.</P>
<P>If &s;uch &s;uppo&s;itions could even be rea&s;onably made, &s;till the concealment of the de&s;ign, for any duration, would be impracticable. It would be announced by the very circum&s;tance of augmenting the army to &s;o great an extent in time of profound peace. What colorable rea&s;on could be a&s;&s;igned in a country &s;o &s;ituated, for &s;uch va&s;t augmentations of the military force? It is impo&s;&s;ible that the people could be long deceived; and the de&s;truction of the project and of the projectors would quickly follow the di&s;covery.</P>
<P>It has been &s;aid that the provi&s;ion, which limits the appropriation of money for the &s;upport of an army to the period of two years, would be unavailing; becau&s;e the executive, when once po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a force large enough to awe the people into &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, would find re&s;ources in that very force &s;ufficient to enable him to di&s;pen&s;e with &s;upplies from the votes of the legi&s;lature. But the que&s;tion again recurs: Upon what pretence could he be put in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a force of that mag|nitude in time of peace? If we &s;uppo&s;e it to have been created in con&s;equence of &s;ome dome&s;tic in&s;urrection or foreign war, then it becomes a ca&s;e not within the principle of the objection; for this is levelled again&s;t the power of keeping up troops in time of peace. Few per&s;ons will be &s;o vi&s;ionary as &s;eriou&s;ly to contend that military forces ought not to be rai&s;ed to quell a rebellion, or re&s;i&s;t an inva&s;ion; and if the defence of the community, under &s;uch circum&s;tances, &s;hould make it nece&s;&s;ary to have an army, &s;o numerous as to hazard its liberty, this is one of tho&s;e calamities for which there is neither preventative nor cure. It cannot be provided again&s;t by any po&s;&s;ible form of government: It might even re&s;ult from a &s;imple league offen&s;ive and defen&s;ive; if it &s;hould ever be nece&s;&s;ary for the confederates or allies to form an army for common defence.</P>
<P><PB N="168" REF="021127_0173_0FB246CDF8F26268">But it is an evil infinitely le&s;s likely to attend us in an united than in an di&s;united &s;tate; nay it may be &s;afely a&s;&s;erted that it is an evil altogether unlikely to attend us in the latter &s;ituation.

<HEAD>NUMBER XXVII. The Subject continued with the &s;ame View.</HEAD>
<P>IT has been urged in different &s;hapes that a con&s;ti|tution of the kind propo&s;ed by the convention, cannot operate without the aid of a military force to execute its laws. This however like mo&s;t other things that have been alledged on that &s;ide, re&s;ts on mere general a&s;&s;ertion; un&s;upported by any preci&s;e or intelligible de&s;ignation of the rea&s;ons upon which it is founded. As far as I have been able to divine the latent meaning of the objectors, it &s;eems to ori|ginate in a pre-&s;uppo&s;ition that the people will be di&s;inclined to the exerci&s;e of federal authority in any matter of an internal nature. Waving any exception that might be taken to the inaccuracy or inexpli|citne&s;s of the di&s;tinction between internal and external, let us inquire what ground there is to pre&s;uppo&s;e that di&s;inclination in the people. Unle&s;s we pre&s;ume, at the &s;ame time, that the powers of the general government will be wor&s;e admini&s;tred than tho&s;e of
<PB N="169" REF="021127_0174_0FB246D210571B00">
the &s;tate governments, there &s;eems to be no room for the pre&s;umption of ill-will, di&s;affection or oppo&s;ition in the people. I believe it may be laid down as a general rule, that their confidence in and obedience to a government, will commonly be proportioned to the goodne&s;s or badne&s;s of its admini&s;tration. It mu&s;t be admitted that there are exceptions to this rule; but the&s;e exceptions depend &s;o entirely on accidental cau&s;es, that they cannot be con&s;idered as having any relation to the intrin&s;ic merits or demerits of a con&s;titution. The&s;e can only be judged of by general principles and maxims.</P>
<P>Various rea&s;ons have been &s;ugge&s;ted in the cour&s;e of the&s;e papers, to induce a probability that the general government will be better admini&s;tered than the particular governments; the principal of which are that the exten&s;ion of the &s;pheres of election will pre&s;ent a greater option, or latitude of choice to the people, that through the medium of the &s;tate legi&s;la|tures, who are &s;elect bodies of men, and who are to appoint the members of the national &s;enate&mdash;there is rea&s;on to expect that this branch will generally be compo&s;ed with peculiar care and judgment: That the&s;e circum&s;tances promi&s;e greater knowledge and more comprehen&s;ive information in the national coun|cils: And that on account of the extent of the coun|try from which tho&s;e, to who&s;e direction they will be committed, will be drawn, they will be le&s;s apt to be tainted by the &s;pirit of faction, and more out of the reach of tho&s;e occa&s;ional ill humours or temporary prejudices and propen&s;ities, which in &s;maller &s;ocieties frequently contaminate the public deliberations, beget inju&s;tice and oppre&s;&s;ion of a part of the community, and engender &s;chemes, which though they gratify a momentary inclination or de&s;ire, terminate in general di&s;tre&s;s, di&s;&s;atisfaction and di&s;gu&s;t. Several additional rea&s;ons of con&s;iderable force, to fortify that proba|bility, will occur when we come to &s;urvey with a more critic eye, the interior &s;tructure of the edifice
<PB N="170" REF="021127_0175_0FB246D4961394B0">
which we are invited to erect. It will be &s;ufficient here to remark, that until &s;atisfactory rea&s;ons can be a&s;&s;igned to ju&s;tify an opinion, that the foederal government is likely to be admini&s;tered in &s;uch a manner as to render it odious or contemptible to the people, there can be no rea&s;onable foundation for the &s;uppo&s;ition, that the laws of the union will meet with any greater ob&s;truction from them, or will &s;tand in need of any other methods to enforce their execution, than the laws of the particular members.</P>
<P>The hope of impunity is a &s;trong incitement to &s;edition&mdash;the dread of puni&s;hment a proportionately &s;trong di&s;couragement to it&mdash;will not the government of the union, which, if po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a due degree of power, can call to its aid the collective re&s;ources of the whole confederacy, be more likely to repre&s;s the <HI>former</HI> &s;entiment, and to in&s;pire the <HI>latter,</HI> than that of a &s;ingle &s;tate, which can only command the re&s;ources within it&s;elf? A turbulent faction in a &s;tate may ea&s;ily &s;uppo&s;e it&s;elf able to contend with the friends to the government in that &s;tate, but it can hardly be &s;o infatuated as to imagine it&s;elf a match for the combined efforts of the union. If this reflec|tion be ju&s;t, there is le&s;s danger of re&s;i&s;tance from irregular combinations of individuals, to the authority of the confederacy, than to that of a &s;ingle member.</P>
<P>I will in this place hazard an ob&s;ervation which will not be the le&s;s ju&s;t becau&s;e to &s;ome it may appear new; which is, that the more the operations of the national authority are intermingled in the ordinary exerci&s;e of government; the more the citizens are accu&s;tomed to meet with it in the common occurrences of their political life; the more it is familiari&s;ed to their &s;ight and to their feelings; the further it enters into tho&s;e objects which touch the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible cords, and put in motion the mo&s;t active &s;prings of the human heart; the greater will be the probability that it will conciliate the re&s;pect and attachment of the commu|nity. Man is very much a creature of habit. A

thing that rarely &s;trikes his &s;en&s;es will generally have but a tran&s;ient influence upon his mind. A govern|ment continually at a di&s;tance and out of &s;ight, can hardly be expected to intere&s;t the &s;en&s;ations of the people. The inference is, that the authority of the union, and the affections of the citizens towards it, will be &s;trengthened rather than weakened by its exten&s;ion to what are called matters of internal con|cern; and that it will have le&s;s occa&s;ion to recur to force in proportion to the familiarity and comprehen|&s;ivene&s;s of its agency. The more it circulates through tho&s;e channels and currents, in which the pa&s;&s;ions of mankind naturally flow, the le&s;s will it require the aid of the violent and perilous expedients of compul&s;ion.</P>
<P>One thing at all events, mu&s;t be evident, that a government like that propo&s;ed, would bid much fairer to avoid the nece&s;&s;ity of u&s;ing force, than the &s;pecies of league contended for by mo&s;t of its oppo|nents; the authority of which &s;hould only operate upon the &s;tates in their political or collective capaci|ties. It has been &s;hewn, that in &s;uch a confederacy, there can be no &s;anction for the laws but force; that frequent delinquencies in the members are the natu|ral offspring of the very frame of the government; and that as often as the&s;e happen they can only be redre&s;&s;ed, if at all, by war and violence.</P>
<P>The plan reported by the convention, by extending the authority of the federal head to the individual citizens of the &s;everal &s;tates, will enable the govern|ment to employ the ordinary magi&s;tracy of each in the execution of its laws. It is ea&s;y to perceive that this will tend to de&s;troy, in the common apprehen&s;ion, all di&s;tinction between the &s;ources from which they might proceed; and will give the federal government the &s;ame advantage for &s;ecuring a due obedience to its authority, which is enjoyed by the government of each &s;tate; in addition to the influence on public opinion, which will re&s;ult from the important con|&s;ideration of its having power to call to its a&s;&s;i&s;tance
<PB N="172" REF="021127_0177_0FB246DDA9B4BA30">
and &s;upport the re&s;ources of the whole Union. It merits particular attention in this place, that the laws of the confederacy, as to the <HI>ennumerated</HI> and <HI>legitimate</HI> objects of its juri&s;diction, will become the SUPREME LAW of the land; to the ob&s;ervance of which, all officers legi&s;lative, executive and judicial in each &s;tate, will be bound by the &s;anctity of an oath. Thus the legi&s;latures, courts and magi&s;trates of the re&s;pective members will be incorporated into the ope|rations of the national government, <HI>as far as its ju&s;t and con&s;titutional authority extends</HI>; and will be rendered auxiliary to the enforcement of its laws.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The &s;ophi&s;try which has been employed to &s;how that this will tend to the de&s;truction of the &s;tate governments will, in its proper place, be fully detected.</NOTE> Any man, who will pur&s;ue by his own reflections the con&s;equences of this &s;ituation, will perceive that there is good ground to calculate upon a regular and peace|able execution of the laws of the union; if its powers are admini&s;tered with a common &s;hare of prudence.

<HEAD>NUMBER XXVIII. The &s;ame Subject continued.</HEAD>
<P>THAT there may happen ca&s;es, in which the na|tional government may be nece&s;&s;itated to re&s;ort to force, cannot be denied. Our own experience has corroborated the le&s;&s;ons taught by the examples of other nations; that emergencies of this &s;ort will &s;ome|times exi&s;t in all &s;ocieties, however con&s;tituted; that &s;editions and in&s;urrections are unhappily maladies as in&s;eparable from the body politic, as tumours and eruptions from the natural body; that the idea of governing at all times by the &s;imple force of law (which we have been told is the only admi&s;&s;ible prin|ciple of republican government) has no place but in the reveries of tho&s;e political doctors, who&s;e &s;agacity di&s;dains the admonitions of experimental in&s;truction.</P>
<P>Should &s;uch emergencies at any time happen under the national government, there could be no remedy but force. The means to be employed mu&s;t be pro|portioned to the extent of the mi&s;chief. If it &s;hould be a &s;light commotion in a &s;mall part of a &s;tate, the militia of the re&s;idue would be adequate to its &s;up|pre&s;&s;ion: and the natural pre&s;umption is, that they would be ready to do their duty. An in&s;urrection, whatever may be its immediate cau&s;e, eventually en|dangers all government: Regard to the public peace, if not to the rights of the union, would engage the citizens, to whom the contagion had not communi|cated it&s;elf, to oppo&s;e the in&s;urgents: And if the ge|neral government &s;hould be found in practice condu|cive to the pro&s;perity and felicity of the people, it were irrational to believe that they would be di&s;in|clined to its &s;upport.</P>
<P>If on the contrary the in&s;urrection &s;hould pervade a whole &s;tate, or a principal part of it, the employ|ment of a different kind of force might become

unavoidable. It appears that Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts found it nece&s;&s;ary to rai&s;e troops for &s;uppre&s;&s;ing the di&s;orders within that &s;tate; that Penn&s;ylvania, from the mere apprehen&s;ion of commotions among a part of her citizens, has thought proper to have recour&s;e to the &s;ame mea&s;ure. Suppo&s;e the &s;tate of New-York had been inclined to re-e&s;tabli&s;h her lo&s;t juri&s;diction over the inhabitants of Vermont; could &s;he have hoped for &s;ucce&s;s in &s;uch an enterpri&s;e from the efforts of the militia alone? Would &s;he not have been compelled to rai&s;e and to maintain a more regular force for the execution of her de&s;ign? If it mu&s;t then be admitted that the nece&s;&s;ity of recurring to a force different from the militia in ca&s;es of this extraordinary nature, is applicable to the &s;tate governments them&s;elves, why &s;hould the po&s;&s;ibility that the national government might be under a like nece&s;&s;ity in &s;imilar extremities, be made an objection to its exi&s;tence?

<P>Let us pur&s;ue this examination in another light. Suppo&s;e, in lieu of one general &s;y&s;tem, two or three, or even four confederacies were to be formed, would not the &s;ame difficulty oppo&s;e it&s;elf to the operations of either of the&s;e confederacies? Would not each of them be expo&s;ed to the &s;ame ca&s;ualties; and, when the&s;e happened, be obliged to have recour&s;e to the &s;ame expedients for upholding its authority, which are objected to a government for all the &s;tates? Would the militia in this &s;uppo&s;ition be more ready or more able to &s;upport the foederal authority than in the ca&s;e of a general union? All candid and intelligent men

mu&s;t upon due con&s;ideration acknowledge that the principle of the objection is equally applicable to either of the two ca&s;es; and that whether we have one government for all the &s;tates, or different governments for different parcels of them, or as many unconnected governments as there are &s;tates, there might &s;ome|times be a nece&s;&s;ity to make u&s;e of a force con&s;tituted differently from the militia to pre&s;erve the peace of the community, and to maintain the ju&s;t authority of the laws again&s;t tho&s;e violent inva&s;ions of them, which amount to in&s;urrections and rebellions.</P>
<P>Independent of all other rea&s;onings upon the &s;ub|ject, it is a full an&s;wer to tho&s;e who require a more p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">emptory provi&s;ion again&s;t military e&s;tabli&s;hments in time of peace, to &s;ay that the whole power of the propo&s;ed government is to be in the hands of the repre&s;entatives of the people.

<P>If the repre&s;entatives of the people betray their con&s;tituents, there is then no re&s;ource left but in the exertion of that original right of &s;elf-defence, which is paramount to all po&s;itive forms of government; and which, again&s;t the u&s;urpations of the national rulers, may be exerted with infinitely better pro&s;pect of &s;uc|ce&s;s, than again&s;t tho&s;e of the rulers of an individual &s;tate. In a &s;ingle &s;tate, if the per&s;ons entru&s;ted with &s;upreme power become u&s;urpers, the different parcels, &s;ubdivi&s;ions or di&s;tricts, of which it con&s;i&s;ts, having no di&s;tinct government in each, can take no regular mea&s;ures for defence. The citizens mu&s;t ru&s;h tumul|tuou&s;ly to arms, without concert, without &s;y&s;tem, without re&s;ource; except in their courage and de&s;pair. The u&s;urpers, cloathed with the forms of legal autho|rity, can too often cru&s;h the oppo&s;ition in embryo. The &s;maller the extent of territory, the more difficult will it be for the people to form a regular or &s;y&s;tematic

plan of oppo&s;ition; and the more ea&s;y will it be to defeat their early efforts. Intelligence can be more &s;peedily obtained of their preparations and move|ments; and the military force in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the u&s;urpers, can be more rapidly directed again&s;t the part where the oppo&s;ition has begun. In this &s;ituation, there mu&s;t be a peculiar coincidence of circum&s;tances to en&s;ure &s;ucce&s;s to the popular re&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>The ob&s;tacles to u&s;urpation, and the facilities of re&s;i&s;tance increa&s;e with the increa&s;ed extent of the &s;tate; provided the citizens under&s;tand their rights and are di&s;po&s;ed to defend them. The natural &s;trength of the people in a large community, in proportion to the artificial &s;trength of the government, is greater than in a &s;mall; and of cour&s;e more competent to a &s;trug|gle with the attempts of the government to e&s;tabli&s;h a tyranny. But in a confederacy, the people, without exaggeration, may be &s;aid to be entirely the ma&s;ters of their own fate. Power being almo&s;t always the rival of power; the general government will at all times &s;tand ready to check the u&s;urpations of the &s;tate governments; and the&s;e will have the &s;ame di&s;po&s;ition towards the general government. The people, by throwing them&s;elves into either &s;cale, will infallibly make it preponderate. If their rights are invaded by either, they can make u&s;e of the other, as the in&s;tru|ment of redre&s;s. How wi&s;e will it be in them by cheri&s;hing the union to pre&s;erve to them&s;elves an ad|vantage which can never be too highly pri&s;ed!</P>
<P>It may &s;afely be received as an axiom in our poli|tical &s;y&s;tem, that the &s;tate governments will in all po&s;&s;ible contingencies afford complete &s;ecurity again&s;t inva&s;ions of the public liberty by the national autho|rity. Projects of u&s;urpation cannot be ma&s;ked under pretences &s;o likely to e&s;cape the penetration of &s;elect bodies of men as of the people at large. The legi&s;|latures will have better means of information. They can di&s;cover the danger at a di&s;tance; and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing all the organs of civil power, and the confidence of

<P>The great extent of the country is a further &s;ecu|rity. We have already experienced its utility again&s;t the attacks of a foreign power. And it would have preci&s;ely the &s;ame effect again&s;t the enterpri&s;es of ambi|tious rulers in the national councils. If the federal army &s;hould be able to quell the re&s;i&s;tance of one &s;tate, the di&s;tant &s;tates would be able to make head with fre&s;h forces. The advantages obtained in one place mu&s;t be abandoned to &s;ubdue the oppo&s;ition in others; and the moment the part which had been reduced to &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion was left to it&s;elf its efforts would be renewed and its re&s;i&s;tance revive.</P>
<P>We &s;hould recollect that the extent of the military force mu&s;t at all events be regulated by the re&s;ources of the country.

<HEAD>NUMBER XXIX. Concerning the Militia.</HEAD>
<P>THE power of regulating the militia, and of commanding its &s;ervices in times of in&s;urrection and inva&s;ion, are natural incidents to the duties of &s;uperintending the common defence, and of watching over the internal peace of the confederacy.</P>
<P>It requires no &s;kill in the &s;cience of war to di&s;cern that uniformity in the organization and di&s;cipline of the militia would be attended with the mo&s;t beneficial effects, whenever they were called into &s;ervice for the public defence. It would enable them to di&s;charge the duties of the camp and of the field with mutual intelligence and concert; an advantage of peculiar moment in the operations of an army: And it would fit them much &s;ooner to acquire the degree of profi|ciency in military functions, which would be e&s;&s;ential to their u&s;efulne&s;s. This de&s;irable uniformity can only be accompli&s;hed by confiding the regulation of the militia to the direction of the national authority. It is therefore with the mo&s;t evident propriety that the plan of the convention propo&s;es to empower the union
<Q>to provide for organizing, arming and di&s;ciplining the militia, and for governing &s;uch part of them as may be employed in the &s;ervice of the United States, <HI>re&s;erving to the &s;tates re&s;pectively the appointment of the officers, and the authority of training the militia according to the di&s;cipline pre&s;cribed by Congre&s;s.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Of the different grounds which have been taken in oppo&s;ition to this plan, there is none that was &s;o little to have been expected, or is &s;o untenable in it&s;elf, as the one from which this particular provi&s;ion has been attacked. If a well regulated militia be the mo&s;t natural defence of a free country, it ought certainly to be under the regulation and at the di&s;po&s;al of that body which is con&s;tituted the guardian of the national
<PB N="179" REF="021127_0184_0FB246FD41BCC748">
&s;ecurity. If &s;tanding armies are dangerous to liberty, an efficacious power over the militia, in the &s;ame body, ought as far as po&s;&s;ible to take away the inducement and the pretext to &s;uch unfriendly in&s;titutions. If the federal government can command the aid of the militia in tho&s;e emergencies which call for the mili|tary arm in &s;upport of the civil magi&s;trate, it can the better di&s;pen&s;e with the employment of a different kind of force. If it cannot avail it&s;elf of the former, it will be obliged to recur to the latter. To render an army unnece&s;&s;ary will be a more certain method of preventing its exi&s;tence tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> thou&s;and prohibi|tions upon paper.</P>
<P>In order to ca&s;t an odium upon the power of calling forth the militia to execute the laws of the union, it has been remarked that there is no where any provi|&s;ion in the propo&s;ed con&s;titution for requiring the aid of the POSSE COMITATUS to a&s;&s;i&s;t the magi&s;trate in the execution of his duty; whence it has been inferred that military force was intended to be his only auxi|liary. There is a &s;triking incoherence in the objecti|ons which have appeared, and &s;ometimes even from the &s;ame quarter, not much calculated to in&s;pire a very favourable opinion of the &s;incerity or fair dealing of their authors. The &s;ame per&s;ons who tell us in one breath that the powers of the federal government will be de&s;potic and unlimited, inform us in the next that it has not authority &s;ufficient even to call out the POSSE COMITATUS. The latter fortunately is as much &s;hort of the truth as the former exceeds it. It would be as ab&s;urd to doubt that a right to pa&s;s all laws <HI>nece&s;&s;ary</HI> and <HI>proper</HI> to execute its declared powers would include that of requiring the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the citizens to the officers who may be entru&s;ted with the execution of tho&s;e laws; as it would be to believe that a right to enact laws nece&s;&s;ary and proper for the impo&s;ition and collection of taxes would involve that of varying the rules of de&s;cent and of the aliena|tion of landed property, or of aboli&s;hing the trial by
<PB N="180" REF="021127_0185_0FB246FF6F315838">
jury in ca&s;es relating to it. It being therefore evi|dent that the &s;uppo&s;ition of a want of power to require the aid of the POSSE COMITATUS is entirely de&s;ti|tute of colour, it will follow that the conclu&s;ion which has been drawn from it, in its application to the authority of the federal government over the militia, is as uncandid as it is illogical. What rea&s;on could there be to infer that force was intended to be the &s;ole in&s;trument of authority, merely becau&s;e there is a power to make u&s;e of it when nece&s;&s;ary? What &s;hall we think of the motives which could induce men of &s;en&s;e to rea&s;on in this extraordinary manner? How &s;hall we prevent a conflict between charity and con|viction?</P>
<P>By a curious refinement upon the &s;pirit of republi|can jealou&s;y, we are even taught to apprehend danger from the militia it&s;elf in the hands of the federal government. It is ob&s;erved that &s;elect corps may be formed, compo&s;ed of the young and the ardent, who may be rendered &s;ub&s;ervient to the views of arbitrary power. What plan for the regulation of the militia may be pur&s;ued by the national government is impo&s;&s;i|ble to be fore&s;een. But &s;o far from viewing the matter in the &s;ame light with tho&s;e who object to &s;elect corps as dangerous, were the con&s;titution ratified, and were I to deliver my &s;entiments to a member of the federal legi&s;lature on the &s;ubject of a militia e&s;tabli&s;hment, I &s;hould hold to him in &s;ub&s;tance the following di&s;|cour&s;e:&mdash;</P>
<Q><P>The project of di&s;ciplining all the militia of the United States, is as futile as it would be injurious, if it were capable of being carried into execution. A tolerable expertne&s;s in military movements is a bu&s;ine&s;s that requires time and practice. It is not a day, nor a week, nor even a month that will &s;uffice for the attainment of it. To oblige the great body of the yeomanry and of the other cla&s;&s;es of the citizens, to be under arms for the purpo&s;e of going through military exerci&s;es and evolutions
<PB N="181" REF="021127_0186_0FB2470105782968">
as often as might be nece&s;&s;ary, to acquire the degree of perfection which would intitle them to the cha|racter of a well regulated militia, would be a real grievance to the people, and a &s;erious public incon|venience and lo&s;s. It would form an annual deduc|tion from the productive labour of the country to an amount which, calculating upon the pre&s;ent numbers of the people, would not fall far &s;hort of a million of pounds. To attempt a thing which would abridge the ma&s;s of labour and indu&s;try to &s;o con&s;iderable an extent would be unwi&s;e; and the experiment, if made, could not &s;ucceed, becau&s;e it would not long be endured. Little more can rea&s;onably be aimed at with re&s;pect to the people at large, than to have them properly armed and equipped; and in order to &s;ee that this be not neglected, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to a&s;&s;emble them once or twice in the cour&s;e of a year.</P>
<P>But though the &s;cheme of di&s;ciplining the whole nation mu&s;t be abandoned as mi&s;chievous or impracticable; yet it is a matter of the utmo&s;t importance that a well dige&s;ted plan &s;hould as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible be adopted for the proper e&s;tabli&s;hment of the militia. The attention of the government ought particularly to be directed to the formation of a &s;elect corps of moderate &s;ize, upon &s;uch prin|ciples as will really &s;it it for &s;ervice in ca&s;e of need. By thus circum&s;cribing the plan, it will be po&s;&s;ible to have an excellent body of well trained militia, ready to take the field whenever the defence of the &s;tate &s;hall require it. This will not only le&s;&s;en the call for military e&s;tabli&s;hments; but if circum|&s;tances &s;hould at any time oblige the government to form an army of any magnitude, that army can never be formidable to the liberties of the people, while there is a large body of citizens, little if at all inferior to them in di&s;cipline and the u&s;e of arms, who &s;tand ready to defend their own rights and tho&s;e of their fellow citizens. This appears to
<PB N="182" REF="021127_0187_0FB24706897F7138">
me the only &s;ub&s;titute that can be devi&s;ed for a &s;tanding army; and the be&s;t po&s;&s;ible &s;ecurity again&s;t it if it &s;hould exi&s;t.</P></Q>
<P>Thus differently from the adver&s;aries of the pro|po&s;ed con&s;titution &s;hould I rea&s;on on the &s;ame &s;ubject; deducing arguments of &s;afety from the very &s;ources which they repre&s;ent as fraught with danger and perdition. But how the national legi&s;lature may rea&s;on on the point, is a thing which neither they nor I can fore&s;ee.</P>
<P>There is &s;omething &s;o far fetched and &s;o extrava|gant in the idea of danger to liberty from the militia, that one is at a lo&s;s whether to treat it with gravity or with raillery; whether to con&s;ider it as a mere trial of &s;kill, like the paradoxes of rhetoricians, as a di&s;ingenuous artifice to in&s;til prejudices at any price, or as the &s;erious offspring of political fanatici&s;m. Where in the name of common &s;en&s;e are our fears to end if we may not tru&s;t our &s;ons, our brothers, our neighbours, our fellow citizens? What &s;hadow of danger can there be from men who are daily mingling with the re&s;t of their countrymen; and who parti|cipate with them in the &s;ame feelings, &s;entiments, habits and intere&s;ts? What rea&s;onable cau&s;e of appre|hen&s;ion can be inferred from a power in the union to pre&s;cribe regulations for the militia and to command its &s;ervices when nece&s;&s;ary; while the particular &s;tates are to have the <HI>&s;ole and exclu&s;ive appointment of the officers?</HI> If it were po&s;&s;ible &s;eriou&s;ly to indulge a jealou&s;y of the militia upon any conceivable e&s;ta|bli&s;hment under the federal government, the circum|&s;tance of the officers being in the appointment of the &s;tates ought at once to extingui&s;h it. There can be no doubt that this circum&s;tance will always &s;ecure to them a preponderating influence over the militia.</P>
<P>In reading many of the publications again&s;t the con&s;titution, a man is apt to imagine that he is peru&s;|ing &s;ome ill written tale or romance; which in&s;tead
<PB N="183" REF="021127_0188_0FB2470CAE627360">

"Gorgons, Hydras and Chimeras dire"
&mdash;di&s;coloring and disfiguring whatever it repre|&s;ents, and transforming every thing it touches into a mon&s;ter.</P>
<P>A &s;ample of this is to be ob&s;erved in the exagge|rated and improbable &s;ugge&s;tions which have taken place re&s;pecting the power of calling for the &s;ervices of the militia. That of New-Hamp&s;hire is to be marched to Georgia, of Georgia to New-Hamp&s;hire, of New-York to Kentuke and of Kentuke to Lake Champlain. Nay the debts due to the French and Dutch are to be paid in militia-men in&s;tead of Louis d'ors and ducats. At one moment there is to be a large army to lay pro&s;trate the liberties of the people; at another moment the militia of Virginia are to be dragged from their homes five or &s;ix hundred miles to tame the republican contumacy of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts; and that of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts is to be tran&s;ported an equal di&s;tance to &s;ubdue the refractory haughtine&s;s of the ari&s;tocratic Virginians. Do the per&s;ons, who rave at this rate, imagine, that their art or their eloquence can impo&s;e any conceits or ab&s;urdities upon the people of America for infallible truths?</P>
<P>If there &s;hould be an army to be made u&s;e of as the engine of de&s;poti&s;m what need of the militia? If there &s;hould be no army, whither would the militia, irritated at being required to undertake a di&s;tant and di&s;tre&s;&s;ing expedition for the purpo&s;e of rivetting the chains of &s;lavery upon a part of their countrymen direct their cour&s;e, but to the &s;eat of the tyrants, who had meditated &s;o fooli&s;h as well as &s;o wicked a project to cru&s;h them in their imagined intrench|ments of power and to make them an example of the ju&s;t vengeance of an abu&s;ed and incen&s;ed people? Is this the way in which u&s;urpers &s;tride to dominion over a numerous and enlightened nation? Do they begin by exciting the dete&s;tation of the very in&s;tru|ments
<PB N="184" REF="021127_0189_0FB2470F329B8160">
of their intended u&s;urpations? Do they u&s;ually commence their career by wanton and di&s;gu&s;tful acts of power calculated to an&s;wer no end, but to draw upon them&s;elves univer&s;al hatred and execration? Are &s;uppo&s;itions of this &s;ort the &s;ober admonitions of di&s;cerning patriots to a di&s;cerning people? Or are they the inflammatory ravings of chagrined incen|diaries or di&s;tempered enthu&s;ia&s;ts? If we were even to &s;uppo&s;e the national rulers actuated by the mo&s;t ungovernable ambition, it is impo&s;&s;ible to believe that they would employ &s;uch prepo&s;terous means to accompli&s;h their de&s;igns.</P>
<P>In times of in&s;urrection or inva&s;ion it would be natural and proper that the militia of a neighbour|ing &s;tate &s;hould be marched into another to re&s;i&s;t a common enemy or to guard the republic again&s;t the violences of faction or &s;edition. This was frequently the ca&s;e in re&s;pect to the fir&s;t object in the cou&s;e of the late war; and this mutual &s;uccour is indeed a principal end of our political a&s;&s;ociation. If the power of affording it be placed under the direction of the union, there will be no danger of a &s;upine and li&s;t|le&s;s inattention to the dangers of a neighbour, till its near approach had &s;uperadded the incitements of &s;elf pre&s;ervation to the too feeble impul&s;es of duty and &s;ympathy.</P>

<P>IT has been already ob&s;erved, that the federal government ought to po&s;&s;e&s;s the power of provid|ing for the &s;upport of the national forces; in which propo&s;ition was intended to be included the expence of rai&s;ing troops of building and equipping fleets, and all other expences in any wi&s;e connected with

military arrangements and operations. But the&s;e are not the only objects to which the juri&s;diction of the union, in re&s;pect to revenue, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be impowered to extend&mdash;It mu&s;t embrace a provi|&s;ion for the &s;upport of the national civil li&s;t&mdash;for the payment of the national debts contracted, or that may be contracted&mdash;and in general for all tho&s;e matters which will call for di&s;bur&s;ements out of the national trea&s;ury. The conclu&s;ion is, that there mu&s;t be interwoven in the frame of the government, a general power of taxation in one &s;hape or another.</P>
<P>Money is with propriety con&s;idered as the vital principle of the body politic; as that which &s;u&s;tains its life and motion, and enables it to perform its mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential functions. A complete power therefore to procure a regular and adequate &s;upply of revenue, as far as the re&s;ources of the community will permit, may be regarded as an indi&s;pen&s;able ingredient in every con&s;titution. From a deficiency in this parti|cular, one of two evils mu&s;t en&s;ue; either the people mu&s;t be &s;ubjected to continual plunder as a &s;ub&s;titute for a more eligible mode of &s;upplying the public wants, or the government mu&s;t &s;ink into a fatal atrophy, and in a &s;hort cour&s;e of time peri&s;h.</P>
<P>In the Ottoman or Turki&s;h empire, the &s;overeign, though in other re&s;pects ab&s;olute ma&s;ter of the lives and fortunes of his &s;ubjects, has no right to impo&s;e a new tax. The con&s;equence is, that he permits the ba&s;haws or governors of provinces to pillage the people at di&s;cretion; and in turn &s;queezes out of them the &s;ums of which he &s;tands in need to &s;atisfy his own exigencies and tho&s;e of the &s;tate. In America, from a like cau&s;e, the government of the union has gradually dwindled into a &s;tate of decay, approaching nearly to annihilation. Who can doubt that the happine&s;s of the people in both countries would be promoted by competent authorities in the proper hands, to provide the revenues which the nece&s;&s;ities of the public might require?</P>
<P><PB N="186" REF="021127_0191_0FB24716A92F9FF8">The pre&s;ent confederation, feeble as it is, intended to repo&s;e in the United States, an unlimited power of providing for the pecuniary wants of the union.

The&s;e have no right to que&s;tion the propriety of the demand, no di&s;cretion beyond that of devi&s;ing the ways and means of furni&s;hing the &s;ums demanded. But though this be &s;trictly and truly the ca&s;e; though the a&s;&s;ump|tion of &s;uch a right would be an infringement of the articles of union; though it may &s;eldom or never have been avowedly claimed; yet in practice it has been con&s;tantly exerci&s;ed; and would continue to be &s;o, as long as the revenues of the confederacy &s;hould remain dependent on the intermediate agency of its members. What the con&s;equences of this &s;y&s;tem have been, is within the knowledge of every man, the lea&s;t conver&s;ant in our public affairs, and has been abun|dantly unfolded in different parts of the&s;e inquiries. It is this which has chiefly contributed to reduce us to a &s;ituation which affords ample cau&s;e, of mortifi|cation to our&s;elves, and of triumph to our enemies.</P>
<P>What remedy can there be for this &s;ituation, but in a change of the &s;y&s;tem, which has produced it? in a change of the fallacious and delu&s;ive &s;y&s;tem of quotas and requi&s;itions? What &s;ub&s;titute can there be imagined for this <HI>ignis fatuus</HI> in finance, but that of permitting the national government to rai&s;e its own revenues by the ordinary methods of taxation, authori&s;ed in every well ordered con&s;titution of civil government?

ingenuity can point out any other expedient to re&s;cue us from the inconveniences and embarra&s;&s;ments, naturally re&s;ulting from defective &s;upplies of the public trea&s;ury.</P>
<P>The more intelligent adver&s;aries of the new con&s;ti|tution admit the force of this rea&s;oning; but they qualify their admi&s;&s;ion by a di&s;tinction between what they call <HI>internal</HI> and <HI>external</HI> taxation. The former they would re&s;erve to the &s;tate governments; the latter, which they explain into commercial impo&s;ts, or rather duties on imported articles, they declare them&s;elves willing to concede to the federal head. This di&s;tinction, however, would violate that funda|mental maxim of good &s;en&s;e and &s;ound policy, which dictates that every POWER ought to be proportionate to its OBJECT; and would &s;till leave the general government in a kind of tutelage to the &s;tate govern|ments, incon&s;i&s;tent with every idea of vigor or effici|ency. Who can pretend that commercial impo&s;ts are or would be alone equal to the pre&s;ent and future exigencies of the union? Taking into the account the exi&s;ting debt, foreign and dome&s;tic, upon any plan of extingui&s;hment, which a man moderately impre&s;&s;ed with the importance of public ju&s;tice and public credit could approve, in addition to the e&s;ta|bli&s;hments, which all parties will acknowledge to be nece&s;&s;ary, we could not rea&s;onably flatter our&s;elves, that this re&s;ource alone, upon the mo&s;t improved &s;cale, would even &s;uffice for its pre&s;ent nece&s;&s;ities. Its future nece&s;&s;ities admit not of calculation or limi|tation; and upon the principle, more than once adverted to, the power of making provi&s;ion for them as they ari&s;e, ought to be equally unconfined. I believe it may be regarded as a po&s;ition, warranted by the hi&s;tory of mankind, that <HI>in the u&s;ual progre&s;s of things the nece&s;&s;ities of a nation in every &s;tage of its exi&s;tence will be found at lea&s;t equal to its re&s;ources.</HI></P>

acknowledge that this &s;y&s;tem cannot be depended upon; and on the other hand, to depend upon it for every thing beyond a certain limit. Tho&s;e who have carefully attended to its vices and deformities as they have been exhibited by experience, or delineated in the cour&s;e of the&s;e papers, mu&s;t feel an invincible repugnancy to tru&s;ting the national intere&s;ts, in any degree, to its operation. Its inevitable tendency, whenever it is brought into activity, mu&s;t be to enfeeble the union, and &s;ow the &s;eeds of di&s;cord and contention between the federal head and its mem|bers, and between the members them&s;elves. Can it be expected that the deficiencies would be better &s;upplied in this mode, than the total wants of the union have heretofore been &s;upplied, in the &s;ame mode? It ought to be recollected, that if le&s;s will be required from the &s;tates, they will have proportionably le&s;s means to an&s;wer the demand. If the opinions of tho&s;e who contend for the di&s;tinction which has been mentioned, were to be received as evidence of truth, one would be led to conclude that there was &s;ome known point in the economy of national affairs, at which it would be &s;afe to &s;top, and to &s;ay&mdash;Thus far the ends of public happine&s;s will be promoted by &s;upplying the wants of government, and all beyond this is unworthy of our care or anxiety.&mdash;How is it po&s;&s;ible that a government half &s;upplied and always nece&s;&s;itous, can fulfil the purpo&s;es of its in&s;titution&mdash; can provide for the &s;ecurity&mdash;advance the pro&s;perity&mdash; or &s;upport the reputation of the commonwealth?

<P><PB N="189" REF="021127_0194_0FB2471F5DF87858">Let us attend to what would be the effects of this &s;ituation in the very fir&s;t war in which we &s;hould happen to be engaged.

Thus circum&s;tanced, a war breaks out. What would be the probable conduct of the government in &s;uch an emergency? Taught by experience that proper dependence could not be placed on the &s;ucce&s;s of requi&s;itions; unable by its own authority to lay hold of fre&s;h re&s;ources, and urged by con&s;iderations of national danger, would it not be driven to the expedient of diverting the funds already appropriated from their proper objects to the defence of the &s;tate? It is not ea&s;y to &s;ee how a &s;tep of this kind cou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d be avoided; and if it &s;hould be taken, it is evident that it would prove the de&s;truction of public credit at the very moment that it was become e&s;&s;ential to the public &s;afety. To imagine that at &s;uch a cri&s;is credit might be di&s;pen&s;ed with, would be the extreme of infatuation. In the modern &s;y&s;tem of war, nations the mo&s;t wealthy are obliged to have recour&s;e to large loans. A country &s;o little opulent as ours, mu&s;t feel this nece&s;&s;ity in a much &s;tronger degree. But who would lend to a government that prefaced its overtures for borrowing, by an act which demon&s;trated that no reliance could be placed on the &s;teadine&s;s of its mea&s;ures for paying? The loans it might be able to procure, would be as limited in their extent as burthen&s;ome in their condi|tions. They would be made upon the &s;ame principles that u&s;urers commonly lend to bankrupt and frau|dulent debtors; with a &s;paring hand, and at enor|mous premiums.</P>
<P>It may perhaps be imagined, that from the &s;can|tine&s;s of the re&s;ources of the country, the nece&s;&s;ity of diverting the e&s;tabli&s;hed funds in the ca&s;e &s;uppo&s;ed, would exi&s;t; though the national government &s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;s an unre&s;trained power of taxation. But two

con&s;iderations will &s;erve to quiet all apprehen&s;ion on this head; one is, that we are &s;ure the re&s;ources of the community in their full extent, will be brought into activity for the benefit of the union; the other is, that whatever deficiencies there may be, can without difficulty be &s;upplied by loans.</P>
<P>The power of creating new funds upon new objects of taxation by its own authority, would enable the national government to borrow, as far as its nece&s;|&s;ities might require. Foreigners as well as the citi|zens of America, could then rea&s;onably repo&s;e confi|dence in its engagements; but to depend upon a government, that mu&s;t it&s;elf depend upon thirteen other governments for the means of fulfilling its con|tracts, when once its &s;ituation is clearly under&s;tood, would require a degree of credulity, not often to be met with in the pecuniary tran&s;actions of mankind, and little reconcileable with the u&s;ual &s;harp-&s;ighted|ne&s;s of avarice.</P>
<P>Reflections of this kind may have trifling weight with men, who hope to &s;ee realized in America, the halcyon &s;cenes of the poetic or fabulous age; but to tho&s;e who believe we are likely to experience a common portion of the vici&s;&s;itudes and calamities, which have fallen to the lot of other nations, they mu&s;t appear entitled to &s;erious attention.

<P>IN di&s;qui&s;itions of every kind there are certain pri|mary truths or fir&s;t principles upon which all &s;ub|&s;equent rea&s;onings mu&s;t depend. The&s;e contain an internal evidence which, antecedent to all reflection

or combination, commands the a&s;&s;ent of the mind. Where it produces not this effect, it mu&s;t proceed either from &s;ome di&s;order in the organs of perception, or from the influence of &s;ome &s;trong intere&s;t, or pa&s;&s;ion, or prejudice. Of this nature are the maxims in geo|metry, that the whole is greater than its part; that things equal to the &s;ame are equal to one another; that two &s;traight lines cannot inclo&s;e a &s;pace; and that all right angles are equal to each other.

And there are other truths in the two latter &s;ciences, which if they cannot pre|tend to rank in the cla&s;s of axioms, are yet &s;uch direct inferences from them, and &s;o obvious in them&s;elves, and &s;o agreeable to the natural and un&s;ophi&s;ticated dictates of common &s;en&s;e, that they challenge the a&s;&s;ent of a &s;ound and unbia&s;&s;ed mind, with a degree of force and conviction almo&s;t equally irre&s;i&s;tible.</P>

But this untractablene&s;s may be carried too far, and may degenerate into ob&s;tinacy, perver&s;ene&s;s or di&s;ingenuity.

Though the&s;e po&s;itions have been el&s;ewhere fully &s;tated, they will perhaps not be impro|perly recapitulated in this place, as introductory to an examination of what may have been offered by way of objection to them. They are in &s;ub&s;tance as follow:&mdash;</P>
<P>A government ought to contain in it&s;elf every power requi&s;ite to the full accompli&s;hment of the objects committed to its care, and to the complete execution of the tru&s;ts for which it is re&s;pon&s;ible; free from every other controul, but a regard to the public good and to the &s;en&s;e of the people.</P>

ca&s;ualties and dangers, to which no po&s;&s;ible limits can be a&s;&s;igned, the power of making that provi&s;ion ought to know no other bounds than the exigencies of the nation and the re&s;ources of the community.</P>
<P>As revenue is the e&s;&s;ential engine by which the means of an&s;wering the national exigencies mu&s;t be procured, the power of procuring that article in its full extent, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be comprehended in that of providing for tho&s;e exigencies.</P>
<P>As theory and practice con&s;pire to prove that the power of procuring revenue is unavailing, when exer|ci&s;ed over the &s;tates in their collective capacities, the federal government mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity be inve&s;ted with an unqualified power of taxation in the ordinary modes.</P>
<P>Did not experience evince the contrary, it would be natural to conclude that the propriety of a general power of taxation in the national government might &s;afely be permitted to re&s;t on the evidence of the&s;e propo&s;itions, una&s;&s;i&s;ted by any additional arguments or illu&s;trations. But we find in fact, that the antagoni&s;ts of the propo&s;ed con&s;titution, &s;o far from acquie&s;cing in their ju&s;tne&s;s or truth &s;eem to make their principal and mo&s;t zealous effort again&s;t this part of the plan. It may therefore be &s;atisfactory to analize the argu|ments with which they combat it.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e of them which have been mo&s;t laboured with that view, &s;eem in &s;ub&s;tance to amount to this:
<Q>It is not true, becau&s;e the exigencies of the union may not be &s;u&s;ceptible of limitation, that its power of laying taxes ought to be unconfined. Revenue is as requi&s;ite to the purpo&s;es of the local admini|&s;trations as to tho&s;e of the union; and the former are at lea&s;t of equal importance with the latter to the happine&s;s of the people. It is therefore as nece&s;&s;ary, that the &s;tate governments &s;hould be able to command the means of &s;upplying their wants, as, that the national government &s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;s the like faculty, in re&s;pect to the wants of the union. But
<PB N="194" REF="021127_0199_0FB23DCC44E82250">
an indefinite power of taxation in the <HI>latter</HI> might, and probably would in time deprive the <HI>former</HI> of the means of providing for their own nece&s;&s;ities; and would &s;ubject them entirely to the mercy of the national legi&s;lature. As the laws of the union are to become the &s;upreme law of the land; as it is to have power to pa&s;s all laws that may be NECESSARY for carrying into execution, the authorities with which it is propo&s;ed to ve&s;t it; the national govern|ment might at any time aboli&s;h the taxes impo&s;ed for &s;tate objects, upon the pretence of an interfe|rence with its own. It might alledge a nece&s;&s;ity of doing this, in order to give efficacy to the national revenues: And thus all the re&s;ources of taxation might by degrees, become the &s;ubjects of federal monopoly, to the intire exclu&s;ion and de&s;truction of the &s;tate governments.</Q></P>
<P>This mode of rea&s;oning appears &s;ometimes to turn upon the &s;uppo&s;ition of u&s;urpation in the national government; at other times it &s;eems to be de&s;igned only as a deduction from the con&s;titutional operation of its intended powers. It is only in the latter light, that it can be admitted to have any preten&s;ions to fairne&s;s. The moment we launch into conjectures about the u&s;urpations of the federal government, we get into an unfathomable aby&s;s, and fairly put our&s;elves out of the reach of all rea&s;oning. Imagination may range at plea&s;ure, till it gets bewildered amid&s;t the labyrinths of an enchanted ca&s;tle, and knows not on which &s;ide to turn to e&s;cape from the apparitions which it&s;elf has rai&s;ed. Whatever may be the limits or modifications of the powers of the union, it is ea&s;y to imagine an endle&s;s train of po&s;&s;ible dangers; and by indulging an exce&s;s of jealou&s;y and timidity, we may bring our&s;elves to a &s;tate of ab&s;olute &s;ceptici&s;m and irre&s;olution. I repeat here what I have ob&s;erved in &s;ub&s;tance in another place, that all ob&s;ervations founded upon the danger of u&s;urpation, ought to be referred to the compo&s;ition and &s;tructure of the government,
<PB N="195" REF="021127_0200_0FB23DCDC419D9B8">
not to the nature or extent of its powers. The &s;tate governments, by their original con&s;titutions, are inve&s;ted with complete &s;overeignty. In what does ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;ecurity con&s;i&s;t again&s;t u&s;urpations from that quarter? Doubtle&s;s in the manner of their formation, and in a due dependence of tho&s;e who are to admini&s;ter them upon the people. If the propo&s;ed con&s;truction of the federal government, be found upon an impartial exa|mination of it, to be &s;uch as to afford, to a proper extent, the &s;ame &s;pecies of &s;ecurity, all apprehen&s;ions on the &s;core of u&s;urpation ought to be di&s;carded.</P>
<P>It &s;hould not be forgotten, that a di&s;po&s;ition in the &s;tate governments to encroach upon the rights of the union, is quite as probable as a di&s;po&s;ition in the union to encroach upon the rights of the &s;tate governments. What &s;ide would be likely to prevail in &s;uch a conflict, mu&s;t depend on the means which the contending par|ties could employ towards en&s;uring &s;ucce&s;s. As in republics, &s;trength is always on the &s;ide of the people; and as there are weighty rea&s;ons to induce a belief that the &s;tate governments will commonly po&s;&s;e&s;s mo&s;t influence over them, the natural conclu&s;ion is, that &s;uch conte&s;ts will be mo&s;t apt to end to the di&s;advan|tage of the union; and that there is greater probability of encroachments by the members upon the federal head, than by the federal head upon the members. But it is evident, that all conjectures of this kind, mu&s;t be extremely vague and fallible, and that it is by far the &s;afe&s;t cour&s;e to lay them altogether a&s;ide; and to confine our attention wholly to th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> nature and extent of the powers as they are delineated in the con&s;titution.

<Q><HI>no &s;tate &s;hall</HI> without the con&s;ent of congre&s;s, <HI>lay any impo&s;ts or duties on imports or exports,</HI> except for the purpo&s;e of executing it<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> in&s;pection laws.</Q>
Hence would re&s;ult an exclu&s;ive power in the union to lay duties on imports and exports, with the particular exception mentioned; but this power is abridged by another clau&s;e which declares, that no tax or duty &s;hall be laid on articles exported from any &s;tate; in con&s;equence of which qualification it now only extends to the <HI>duties on imports.</HI> This an&s;wers to the &s;econd ca&s;e. The third will
<PB N="198" REF="021127_0203_0FB23DD244566D88">
be found in that clau&s;e, which declares that congre&s;s &s;hall have power
<Q>to e&s;tabli&s;h an UNIFORM RULE of naturalization throughout the United States.</Q>
This mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be exclu&s;ive; becau&s;e if each &s;tate had power to pre&s;cribe a DISTINCT RULE there could be no UNIFORM RULE.</P>
<P>A ca&s;e which may perhaps be thought to re&s;emble the latter, but which is in fact widely different, affects the que&s;tion immediately under con&s;ideration. I mean the power of impo&s;ing taxes on all articles other than exports and imports. This, I contend, is mani|fe&s;tly a concurrent and coequal authority in the United States and in the individual &s;tates. There is plainly no expre&s;&s;ion in the granting clau&s;e which makes that power <HI>exclu&s;ive</HI> in the union. There is no independent clau&s;e or &s;entence which prohibits the &s;tates from exerci&s;ing it. So far is this from being the ca&s;e, that a plain and conclu&s;ive argument to the contrary is deducible from the re&s;traint laid upon the &s;tates in rela|tion to duties on imports and exports. This re&s;triction implies an admi&s;&s;ion, that if it were not in&s;erted the &s;tates would po&s;&s;e&s;s the power it excludes, and it implies a further admi&s;&s;ion, that as to all other taxes the authority of the &s;tates remains undimini&s;hed. In any other view it would be both unnece&s;&s;ary and dangerous; it would be unnece&s;&s;ary, becau&s;e if the grant to the union of the power of laying &s;uch duties implied the exclu&s;ion of the &s;tates, or even their &s;ub|ordination in this particular, there could be no need of &s;uch a re&s;triction; it would be dangerous, becau&s;e the introduction of it leads directly to the conclu&s;ion which has been mentioned, and which if the rea&s;oning of the objectors be ju&s;t, could not have been intended; I mean that the &s;tates in all ca&s;es to which the re&s;triction did not apply would have a concurrent power of tax|ation with the union. The re&s;triction in que&s;tion amounts to what lawyers call a NEGATIVE PREG|NANT; that is a <HI>negation</HI> of one thing and an <HI>affirmance</HI>
<PB N="199" REF="021127_0204_0FB23DD3CB5CFF20">
of another; a negation of the authority of the &s;tates to impo&s;e taxes on imports and exports, and an affir|mance of their authority to impo&s;e them on all other articles. It would be mere &s;ophi&s;try to argue that it was meant to exclude them <HI>ab&s;olutely</HI> from the impo&s;i|tion of taxes of the former kind, and to leave them at liberty to lay others <HI>&s;ubject to the controul</HI> of the national legi&s;lature. The re&s;training or prohibitory clau&s;e only &s;ays, that they &s;hall not <HI>without the con&s;ent of congre&s;s</HI> lay &s;uch duties; and if we are to under&s;tand this in the &s;en&s;e la&s;t mentioned, the con&s;titution would then be made to introduce a formal provi&s;ion for the &s;ake of a very ab&s;urd conclu&s;ion; which is that the &s;tates <HI>with the con&s;ent</HI> of the national legi&s;lature might tax imports and exports; and that they might tax every other article <HI>unle&s;s controuled</HI> by the &s;ame body. If this was the intention, why was it not left in the fir&s;t in&s;tance to what is alledged to be the natural operation of the original clau&s;e conferring a general power of taxation upon the union? It is evident that this could not have been the intention, and that it will not bear a con&s;truction of the kind.</P>
<P>As to a &s;uppo&s;ition of repugnancy between the power of taxation in the &s;tates and in the union, it cannot be &s;upported in that &s;en&s;e which would be requi&s;ite to work an exclu&s;ion of the &s;tates. It is indeed po&s;&s;ible that a tax might be laid on a particular article by a &s;tate, which might render it <HI>inexpedient</HI> that a further tax &s;hould be laid on the &s;ame article by the union; but it would not imply a con&s;titutional inability to impo&s;e a further tax. The quantity of the impo&s;ition, the expediency or inexpediency of an increa&s;e on either &s;ide, would be mutually que&s;tions of prudence; but there would be involved no direct contradiction of power. The particular policy of the national and of the &s;tate &s;y&s;tems of finance might now and then not exactly coincide, and might require reciprocal forbearances. It is not however a mere po&s;&s;ibility of inconvenience in the exerci&s;e of powers,
<PB N="200" REF="021127_0205_0FB23DD547923B80">
but an immediate con&s;titutional repugnancy, that can by implication alienate and extingui&s;h a pre-exi&s;ting right of &s;overeignty.</P>
<P>The nece&s;&s;ity of a concurrent juri&s;diction in certain ca&s;es re&s;ults from the divi&s;ion of the &s;overeign power; and the rule that all authorities of which the &s;tates are not explicitly dive&s;ted in favour of the union, remain with them in full vigour, is not only a theo|retical con&s;equence of that divi&s;ion, but is clearly admitted by the whole tenor of the in&s;trument which contains the articles of the propo&s;ed con&s;titution. We there find that notwith&s;tanding the affirmative grants of general authorities, there has been the mo&s;t pointed care in tho&s;e ca&s;es where it was deemed improper that the like authorities &s;hould re&s;ide in the &s;tates, to in&s;ert negative clau&s;es prohibiting the exerci&s;e of them by the &s;tates. The tenth &s;ection of the fir&s;t article con&s;i&s;ts altogether of &s;uch provi&s;ions. This circum&s;tance is a clear indication of the &s;en&s;e of the convention, and furni&s;hes a rule of interpretation out of the body of the act which ju&s;tifies the po&s;ition I have advanced, and refutes every hypothe&s;is to the contrary.</P>

<P>THE re&s;idue of the argument again&s;t the provi|&s;ions in the con&s;titution, in re&s;pect to taxation, is ingrafted upon the following clau&s;es;&mdash;the la&s;t clau&s;e of the eighth &s;ection of the fir&s;t article, autho|ri&s;es the national legi&s;lature
<Q>to make all laws which &s;hall be <HI>nece&s;&s;ary</HI> and <HI>proper,</HI> for carrying into execution <HI>the powers</HI> by that con&s;titution ve&s;ted in the government of the United States, or in any

and the &s;econd clau&s;e of the &s;ixth article declares, that

<P>The&s;e two clau&s;es have been the &s;ources of much virulent invective and petulant declamation again&s;t the propo&s;ed con&s;titution, they have been held up to the people in all the exaggerated colours of mi&s;repre|&s;entation, as the pernicious engines by which their local governments were to be de&s;troyed and their liberties exterminated&mdash;as the hideous mon&s;ter who&s;e devouring jaws would &s;pare neither &s;ex nor age, nor high nor low, nor &s;acred nor profane; and yet &s;trange as it may appear, after all this clamour, to tho&s;e who may not have happened to contemplate them in the &s;ame light, it may be affirmed with perfect confi|dence, that the con&s;titutional operation of the intended government would be preci&s;ely the &s;ame, if the&s;e clau&s;es were entirely obliterated, as if they were re|peated in every article. They are only declaratory of a truth, which would have re&s;ulted by nece&s;&s;ary and unavoidable implication from the very act of con&s;tituting a federal government, and ve&s;ting it with certain &s;pecified powers. This is &s;o clear a propo&s;ition, that moderation it&s;elf can &s;carcely li&s;ten to the railings which have been &s;o copiou&s;ly vented again&s;t this part of the plan, without emotions that di&s;turb its equanimity.</P>
<P>What is a power, but the ability or faculty of doing a thing? What is the ability to do a thing but the power of employing the <HI>means</HI> nece&s;&s;ary to its execu|tion? What is a LEGISLATIVE power but a power of making LAWS? What are the <HI>means</HI> to execute a LEGISLATIVE power but LAWS?

<PB N="202" REF="021127_0207_0FB23DD844262A10">
What are the proper means of executing &s;uch a power but <HI>nece&s;&s;ary</HI> and <HI>proper</HI> laws?</P>
<P>This &s;imple train of enquiry furni&s;hes us at once with a te&s;t of the true nature of the clau&s;e complained of. It conducts us to this palpable truth, that a power to lay and collect taxes mu&s;t be a power to pa&s;s all laws <HI>nece&s;&s;ary</HI> and <HI>proper</HI> for the execution of that power: and what does the unfortunate and calumni|ated provi&s;ion in que&s;tion do more than declare the &s;ame truth; to wit, that the national legi&s;lature to whom the power of laying and collecting taxes had been previou&s;ly given, might in the execution of that power pa&s;s all laws <HI>nece&s;&s;ary</HI> and <HI>proper</HI> to carry it into effect? I have applied the&s;e ob&s;ervations thus particularly to the power of taxation, becau&s;e it is the immediate &s;ubject under con&s;ideration, and becau&s;e it is the mo&s;t important of the authorities propo&s;ed to be conferred upon the union. But the &s;ame proce&s;s will lead to the &s;ame re&s;ult in relation to all other powers declared in the con&s;titution. And it is <HI>expre&s;sly</HI> to execute the&s;e powers, that the &s;weeping clau&s;e, as it has been affectedly called, authori&s;es the national legi&s;lature to pa&s;s all <HI>nece&s;&s;ary</HI> and <HI>proper</HI> laws. If there be any thing exceptionable, it mu&s;t be &s;ought for in the &s;pecific powers, upon which this general declaration is predicated. The declaration it&s;elf, tho' it may be chargeable with tautology or redundancy, is at lea&s;t perfectly harmle&s;s.</P>
<P>But SUSPICION may a&s;k, why then was it intro|duced? The an&s;wer is, that it could only have been done for greater caution, and to guard again&s;t all cavilling refinements in tho&s;e who might hereafter feel a di&s;po&s;ition to curtail and evade the legitimate authorities of the union. The convention probably fore&s;aw, what it has been a principal aim of the&s;e papers to inculcate, that the danger which mo&s;t threatens our political welfare, is, that the &s;tate governments will finally &s;ap the foundations of the union; and might therefore think it nece&s;&s;ary, in
<PB N="203" REF="021127_0208_0FB23DDAD58F5920">
&s;o cardinal a point, to leave nothing to con&s;truction. Whatever may have been the inducement to it, the wi&s;dom of the precaution is evident from the cry which has been rai&s;ed again&s;t it; as that very cry betrays a di&s;po&s;ition to que&s;tion the great and e&s;&s;ential truth which it is manife&s;tly the object of that provi&s;ion to declare.</P>
<P>But it may be again a&s;ked, who is to judge of the <HI>nece&s;&s;ity</HI> and <HI>propriety</HI> of the laws to be pa&s;&s;ed for executing the powers of the union? I an&s;wer fir&s;t that this que&s;tion ari&s;es as well and as fully upon the &s;imple grant of tho&s;e powers, as upon the declaratory clau&s;e: and I an&s;wer in the &s;econd place, that the national government, like every other, mu&s;t judge in the fir&s;t in&s;tance of the proper exerci&s;e of its powers; and its con&s;tituents in the la&s;t. If the federal govern|ment &s;hould overpa&s;s the ju&s;t bounds of its authority, and make a tyrannical u&s;e of its powers; the people who&s;e creature it is mu&s;t appeal to the &s;tandard they have formed, and take &s;uch mea&s;ures to redre&s;s the injury done to the con&s;titution, as the exigency may &s;ugge&s;t and prudence ju&s;tify. The propriety of a law in a con&s;titutional light, mu&s;t always be determined by the nature of the powers upon which it is founded. Suppo&s;e by &s;ome forced con&s;truction of its authority (which indeed cannot ea&s;ily be imagined) the federal legi&s;lature &s;hould attempt to vary the law of de&s;cent in any &s;tate; would it not be evident that in making &s;uch an attempt it had exceeded its juri&s;diction and infringed upon that of the &s;tate? Suppo&s;e again that upon the pretence of an interference with its revenues, it &s;hould undertake to abrogate a land tax impo&s;ed by the authority of a &s;tate; would it not be equally evident that this was an inva&s;ion of that concurrent juri&s;diction in re&s;pect to this &s;pecies of tax which its con&s;titution plainly &s;uppo&s;es to exi&s;t in the &s;tate govern|ments? If there ever &s;hould be a doubt on this head the credit of it will be entirely due to tho&s;e rea&s;oners, who, in the imprudent zeal of their animo&s;ity to the
<PB N="204" REF="021127_0209_0FB23DDC0A208780">
plan of the convention, have laboured to invelope it in a cloud calculated to ob&s;cure the plaine&s;t and &s;imple&s;t truths.</P>
<P>But it is &s;aid, that the laws of the union are to be the <HI>&s;upreme law</HI> of the land. What inference can be drawn from this, or what would they amount to, if they were not to be &s;upreme? It is evident they would amount to nothing. A LAW by the very meaning of the term includes &s;upremacy. It is a rule which tho&s;e to whom it is pre&s;cribed are bound to ob&s;erve. This re&s;ults from every political a&s;&s;oci|ation. If individuals enter into a &s;tate of &s;ociety, the laws of that &s;ociety mu&s;t be the &s;upreme regulator of their conduct. If a number of political &s;ocieties enter into a larger political &s;ociety, the laws which the latter may enact, pur&s;uant to the powers entru&s;ted to it by its con&s;titution, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be &s;upreme over tho&s;e &s;ocieties, and the individuals of whom they are compo&s;ed. It would otherwi&s;e be a mere treaty, dependent on the good faith of the parties, and not a government; which is only another word for POLI|TICAL POWER AND SUPREMACY. But it will not follow from this doctrine that acts of the larger &s;ociety which are <HI>not pur&s;uant</HI> to its con&s;titutional powers, but which are inva&s;ions of the re&s;iduary authorities of the &s;maller &s;ocieties, will become the &s;upreme law of the land. The&s;e will be merely acts of u&s;urpation, and will de&s;erve to be treated as &s;uch. Hence we perceive that the clau&s;e which declares the &s;upremacy of the laws of the union, like the one we have ju&s;t before con&s;idered, only declares a truth, which flows immediately and nece&s;&s;arily from the in&s;titution of a federal government. It will not, I pre&s;ume, have e&s;caped ob&s;ervation, that it <HI>expre&s;sly</HI> confines this &s;upremacy to laws made <HI>pur&s;uant to the con&s;titution</HI>; which I mention merely as an in&s;tance of caution in the convention; &s;ince that limitation would have been to be under&s;tood, though it had not been expre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P><PB N="205" REF="021127_0210_0FB23DDD892D8C60">Though a law therefore for laying a tax for the u&s;e of the United States would be &s;upreme in its nature, and could not legally be oppo&s;ed or controuled; yet a law for abrogating or preventing the collection of a tax laid by the authority of a &s;tate (unle&s;s upon imports and exports) would not be the &s;upreme law of the land, but an u&s;urpation of power not granted by the con&s;titution. As far as an improper accumulation of taxes on the &s;ame object might tend to render the collection difficult or precarious, this would be a mutual inconvenience not ari&s;ing from a &s;uperiority or defect of power on either &s;ide, but from an injudicious exerci&s;e of power by one or the other, in a manner equally di&s;advantageous to both. It is to be hoped and pre&s;umed however, that mutual intere&s;t would dictate a concert in this re&s;pect which would avoid any material inconvenience. The infer|ence from the whole is&mdash;that the individual &s;tates would, under the propo&s;ed con&s;titution, retain an independent and uncontroulable authority to rai&s;e revenue to any extent of which they may &s;tand in need by every kind of taxation except duties on imports and exports. It will be &s;hewn in the next paper that this <HI>concurrent juri&s;diction</HI> in the article of taxation was the only admi&s;&s;ible &s;ub&s;titute for an entire &s;ubordination, in re&s;pect to this branch of power, of &s;tate authority to that of the union.</P>

<P>I FLATTER my&s;elf it has been clearly &s;hewn in my la&s;t number, that the particular &s;tates, under the propo&s;ed con&s;titution, would have CO-EQUAL authority with the union in the article of revenue, except as to duties on imports. As this leaves open

to the &s;tates far the greate&s;t part of the re&s;ources of the community, there can be no color for the a&s;&s;er|tion, that they would not po&s;&s;e&s;s means as abundant as could be de&s;ired for the &s;upply of their own wants, independent of all external control. That the field is &s;ufficiently wide will more fully appear when we come to develope the incon&s;iderable &s;hare of the public expences, for which it will fall to the lot of the &s;tate governments to provide.</P>
<P>To argue upon ab&s;tract principles that this co-ordi|nate authority cannot exi&s;t, would be to &s;et up theory and &s;uppo&s;ition again&s;t fact and reality. However proper &s;uch rea&s;onings might be to &s;hew that a thing <HI>ought not to exi&s;t,</HI> they are wholly to be rejected, when they are made u&s;e of to prove that it does not exi&s;t, contrary to the evidence of the fact it&s;elf. It is well known that in the Roman republic, the legi&s;lative authority in the la&s;t re&s;ort, re&s;ided for ages in two different political bodies; not as branches of the &s;ame legi&s;lature, but as di&s;tinct and independent legi&s;|latures; in each of which an oppo&s;ite intere&s;t pre|vailed; in one the Patrician&mdash;in the other the Plebeian. Many arguments might have been adduced to prove the unfitne&s;s of two &s;uch &s;eemingly contra|dictory authorities, each having power to <HI>annul</HI> or <HI>repeal</HI> the acts of the other. But a man would have been regarded as frantic, who &s;hould have attempted at Rome to di&s;prove their exi&s;tence. It will readily be under&s;tood, that I allude to the COMITIA CEN|TURIATA and the COMITIA TRIBUTA. The former, in which the people voted by centuries, was &s;o arranged as to give a &s;uperiority to the Patrician intere&s;t: In the latter, in which numbers prevailed, the Plebeian intere&s;t had an entire predominancy. And yet the&s;e two legi&s;latures co-exi&s;ted for ages, and the Roman republic attained to the pinacle of human greatne&s;s.</P>
<P>In the ca&s;e particularly under con&s;ideration there is no &s;uch contradiction as appears in the example

cited; there is no power on either &s;ide to annul the acts of the other. And in practice there is little rea&s;on to apprehend any inconvenience; becau&s;e in a &s;hort cour&s;e of time the wants of the &s;tates will naturally reduce them&s;elves within <HI>a very narrow compa&s;s</HI>; and in the interim the United States will, in all probability, find it convenient to ab&s;tain wholly from tho&s;e objects to which the particular &s;tates would be inclined to re&s;ort.</P>
<P>To form a more preci&s;e judgment of the true merits of this que&s;tion, it will be we<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l to advert to the proportion between the objects that will require a federal provi&s;ion in re&s;pect to revenue; and tho&s;e which will require a &s;tate provi&s;ion. We &s;hall di&s;|cover that the former are altogether unlimited; and that the latter are circum&s;cribed within very mode|rate bounds. In pur&s;uing this inquiry, we mu&s;t bear in mind, that we are not to confine our view to the pre&s;ent period, but to look forward to remote futu|rity. Con&s;titutions of civil government are not to be framed upon a calculation of exi&s;ting exigencies; but upon a combination of the&s;e, with the probable exi|gencies of ages, according to the natural and tried cour&s;e of human affairs. Nothing therefore can be more fallacious, than to infer the extent of any power proper to be lodged in the national government, from an e&s;timate of its immediate nece&s;&s;ities. There ought to be a CAPACITY to provide for future contin|gencies, as they may happen; and as the&s;e are illimi|table in their nature, &s;o it is impo&s;&s;ible &s;afely to limit that capacity. It is true perhaps that a computation might be made, with &s;ufficient accuracy to an&s;wer the purpo&s;e, of the quantity of revenue requi&s;ite to di&s;charge the &s;ub&s;i&s;ting engagements of the union, and to maintain tho&s;e e&s;tabli&s;hments, which for &s;ome time to come, would &s;uffice in time of peace. But would it be wi&s;e, or would it not rather be the extreme of folly to &s;top at this point, and to leave the govern|ment intru&s;ted with the care of the national defence,
<PB N="208" REF="021127_0213_0FB23DE211A47AC0">
in a &s;tate of ab&s;olute incapacity to provide for the protection of the community, again&s;t future inva&s;ions of the public peace by foreign war or dome&s;tic con|vul&s;ions? If we mu&s;t be obliged to exceed this point, where can we &s;top &s;hort of an indefinite power of providing for emergencies as they may ari&s;e?

<P>Admitting that we ought to try the novel and ab&s;urd experiment in politics, of tying up the hands of government from offen&s;ive war founded upon rea&s;ons of &s;tate: Yet, certainly we ought not to di&s;able it from guarding the community again&s;t the ambition or enmity of other nations. A cloud has been for &s;ome time hanging over the European world.

To judge from the hi&s;tory of mankind we &s;hall be compelled to conclude, that the fiery and de&s;tructive pa&s;&s;ions of war reign in the human brea&s;t with much more powerful &s;way, than the mild and beneficent &s;entiments of peace; and that to model our political &s;y&s;tems upon &s;peculations of la&s;ting tranquility, would be to calculate on the weaker &s;prings of the human character.</P>
<P>What are the chief &s;ources of expence in every government? What has occa&s;ioned that enormous accumulation of debts with which &s;everal of the European nations are oppre&s;&s;ed? The an&s;wer plainly is, wars and rebellions, the &s;upport of tho&s;e in&s;titu|tions which are nece&s;&s;ary to guard the body politic again&s;t the&s;e two mo&s;t mortal di&s;ea&s;es of &s;ociety. The expences ari&s;ing from tho&s;e in&s;titutions which are relative to the mere dome&s;tic police of a &s;tate, to the &s;upport of its legi&s;lative, executive and judiciary departments, with their different appendages, and to the encouragement of agriculture and manufactures, (which will comprehend almo&s;t all the objects of &s;tate expenditure) are in&s;ignificant in compari&s;on with tho&s;e which relate to the national defence.</P>
<P>In the kingdom of Great-Britain, where all the o&s;tentatious apparatus of monarchy is to be provided for, not above a fifteenth part of the annual income of the nation is appropriated to the cla&s;s of expences la&s;t mentioned; the other fourteen fifteenths are ab&s;orbed in the payment of the intere&s;t of debts, contracted for carrying on the wars in which that country has been engaged, and in the maintenance of fleets and armies. If on the one hand it &s;hould be ob&s;erved that the
<PB N="210" REF="021127_0215_0FB23DE70DC12610">
expences incurred in the pro&s;ecution of the ambitious enterprizes and vain-glorious pur&s;uits of a monarchy, are not a proper &s;tandard by which to judge of tho&s;e which might be nece&s;&s;ary in a republic; it ought on the other hand to be remarked, that there &s;hould be as great a di&s;proportion, between the profu&s;ion and extra|vagance of a wealthy kingdom in its dome&s;tic admi|ni&s;tration, and the frugality and economy, which, in that particular, become the mode&s;t &s;implicity of republican government. If we balance a proper deduc|tion from one &s;ide again&s;t that which it is &s;uppo&s;ed ought to be made from the other, the proportion may &s;till be con&s;idered as holding good.</P>
<P>But let us take a view of the large debt which we have our&s;elves contracted in a &s;ingle war, and let us only calculate on a common &s;hare of the events which di&s;turb the peace of nations, and we &s;hall in&s;tantly perceive without the aid of any elaborate illu&s;tration, that there mu&s;t always be an immen&s;e di&s;proportion between the objects of federal and &s;tate expenditure. It is true that &s;everal of the &s;tates &s;eparately are incumbered with con&s;iderable debts, which are an excre&s;cence of the late war. But this cannot happen again if the propo&s;ed &s;y&s;tem be adopted; and when the&s;e debts are di&s;charged, the only call for revenue of any con&s;equence, which the &s;tate governments will continue to experience, will be for the mere &s;upport of their re&s;pective civil li&s;ts; to which, if we add all contingencies, the total amount in every &s;tate, ought not to exceed two hundred thou&s;and pounds.</P>
<P>If it cannot be denied to be a ju&s;t principle, that in framing a con&s;titution of government for a nation, we ought in tho&s;e provi&s;ions which are de&s;igned to be permanent, to calculate not on temporary but on per|manent cau&s;es of expence; our attention would be directed to a provi&s;ion in favor of the &s;tat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> govern|ments for an annual &s;um of about 200,00<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> pounds; while the exigencies of the union could be &s;u&s;ceptible of no limits, even in imagination. In this view of
<PB N="211" REF="021127_0216_0FB23DE805800CF0">
the &s;ubject by what logic can it be maintained, that the local governments ought to command in perpe|tuity, an <HI>exclu&s;ive</HI> &s;ource of revenue for any &s;um beyond the extent of 200,000 pounds? To extend its power further, in <HI>exclu&s;ion</HI> of the authority of the union, would be to take the re&s;ources of the com|munity out of tho&s;e hands which &s;tood in need of them for the public welfare, in order to put them into other hands, which could have no ju&s;t or proper occa&s;ion for them.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e then the convention had been inclined to proceed upon the principle of a repartition of the objects of revenue between the union and its members, in <HI>proportion</HI> to their comparitive nece&s;&s;ities; what particular fund could have been &s;elected for the u&s;e of the &s;tates, that would not either have been too much or too little; too little for their pre&s;ent, too much for their future wants? As to the line of &s;eparation between external and internal taxes, this would leave to the &s;tates, at a rough computation, the command of two-thirds of the re&s;ources of the community to defray from a tenth to a twentieth of its expences; and to the union, one third of the re&s;ources of the community, to defray from nine tenths to nineteen twentieths of its expences. If we de&s;ert this boundary, and content our&s;elves with leaving to the &s;tates an exclu&s;ive power of taxing hou&s;es and lands, there would &s;till be a great di&s;proportion between the <HI>means</HI> and the <HI>end</HI>; the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of one third of the re&s;ources of the community, to &s;upply at mo&s;t one tenth of its wants. If any fund could have been &s;elected and appropriated equal to and not greater than the object, it would have been inadequate to the di&s;charge of the exi&s;ting debts of the particular &s;tates, and would have left them dependent on the union for a provi&s;ion for this purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>The preceding train of ob&s;ervations will ju&s;tify the po&s;ition which has been el&s;ewhere laid down, that,

Any &s;eparation of the objects of revenue that could have been fallen upon, would have amounted to a &s;acrifice of the great INTERESTS of the union to the POWER of the individual &s;tates. The convention thought the concurrent juri&s;diction preferable to that &s;ubordination; and it is evident that it has at lea&s;t the merit of reconciling an indefinite con&s;titutional power of taxation in the federal government, with an adequate and independent power in the &s;tates to provide for their own nece&s;&s;ities. There remain a few other lights, in which this important &s;ubject of taxation will claim a further con&s;ideration.</P>

<HEAD>NUMBER XXXV. The &s;ame Subject continued.</HEAD>
<P>BEFORE we proceed to examine any other objec|tions to an indefinite power of taxation in the union, I &s;hall make one general remark; which is, that if the juri&s;diction of the national government in the article of revenue &s;hould be re&s;tricted to parti|cular objects, it would naturally occa&s;ion an undue proportion of the public burthens to fall upon tho&s;e objects. Two evils would &s;pring from this &s;ource, the oppre&s;&s;ion of particular branches of indu&s;try, and an unequal di&s;tribution of the taxes, as well among the &s;everal &s;tates as among the citizens of the &s;ame &s;tate.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e, as has been contended for, the federal power of taxation were to be confined to duties on imports, it is evident that the government, for want
<PB N="213" REF="021127_0218_0FB23DEB05592BD0">
of being able to command other re&s;ources, would fre|quently be tempted to extend the&s;e duties to an inju|rious exce&s;s. There are per&s;ons who imagine that this can never be the ca&s;e; &s;ince the higher they are, the more it is alledged they will tend to di&s;courage an extravagant con&s;umption, to produce a favorable balance of trade, and to promote dome&s;tic manu|factures. But all extremes are prenicious in various ways. Exorbitant duties on imported articles &s;erve to beget a general &s;pirit of &s;muggling; which is always prejudicial to the fair trader, and eventually to the revenue it&s;elf: They tend to render other cla&s;&s;es of the community tributary in an improper degree to the manufacturing cla&s;&s;es to whom they give a premature monopoly of the markets: They &s;ometimes force indu&s;try out of its more natural channels into others in which it flows with le&s;s advantage. And in the la&s;t place they oppre&s;s the merchant, who is often obliged to pay them him&s;elf without any retribution from the con&s;umer. When the demand is equal to the quantity of goods at market, the con&s;umer generally pays the duty; but when the markets happen to be over&s;tocked, a great proportion falls upon the merchant, and &s;ometimes not only exhau&s;ts his profits, but breaks in upon his capital. I am apt to think that a divi&s;ion of the duty between the &s;eller and the buyer more often happens than is commonly imagined. It is not always po&s;&s;ible to rai&s;e the price of a commodity, in exact proportion to every additional impo&s;ition laid upon it. The merchant, e&s;pecially in a country of &s;mall commercial capital, is often under a nece&s;&s;ity of keeping prices down, in order to a more expeditious &s;ale.</P>
<P>The maxim that the con&s;umer is the payer, is &s;o much oftener true than the rever&s;e of the propo&s;ition, that it is far more equitable the duties on imports &s;hould go into a common &s;tock, than that they &s;hould redound to the exclu&s;ive benefit of the importing &s;tates. But it is not &s;o generally true as to render
<PB N="214" REF="021127_0219_0FB23DEC866FB480">
it equitable that tho&s;e duties &s;hould form the only national fund. When they are paid by the merchant, they operate as an additional tax upon the importing &s;tate; who&s;e citizens pay their proportion of them in the character of con&s;umers. In this view they are productive of inequality among the &s;tates; which inequality would be increa&s;ed with the increa&s;ed extent of the duties. The confinement of the national revenues to this &s;pecies of impo&s;ts, would be attended with inequality, from a different cau&s;e, between the manufacturing and the non-manufacturing &s;tates. The &s;tates which can go furthe&s;t towards the &s;upply of their own wants, by their own manufactures, will not, according to their numbers or wealth, con&s;ume &s;o great a proportion of imported articles, as tho&s;e &s;tates which are not in the &s;ame favourable &s;ituation; they would not therefore in this mode alone contri|bute to the public trea&s;ury in a ratio to their abi|lities. To make them do this, it is nece&s;&s;ary that recour&s;e be had to exci&s;es; the proper objects of which are particular kinds of manufactures. New-York is more deeply intere&s;ted in the&s;e con&s;iderations than &s;uch of her citizens as contend for limiting the power of the union to external taxation may be aware of. New-York is an importing &s;tate, and from a greater di&s;proportion between her population and territory, is le&s;s likely, than &s;ome other &s;tates, &s;peedily to become in any con&s;iderable degree a manuf<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cturing &s;tate. She would of cour&s;e &s;uffer in a double light from re&s;training the juri&s;diction of the union to commercial impo&s;ts.</P>
<P>So far as the&s;e ob&s;ervations tend to inculcate a danger of the import duties being extended to an injurious extreme it may be ob&s;erved, conformably to a remark made in another part of the&s;e papers, that the intere&s;t of the revenue it&s;elf would be a &s;ufficient guard again&s;t &s;uch an extreme. I readily admit that this would be the ca&s;e as long as other re&s;ources were open; but if the avenues to them were clo&s;ed, HOPE,
<PB N="215" REF="021127_0220_0FB23DEE069E6D70">
&s;timulated by nece&s;&s;ity, might beget experiments for|tified by rigorous precautions and additional penal|ties; which for a time might have the intended effect, till there had been lei&s;ure to contrive expe|dients to elude the&s;e new precautions. The fir&s;t &s;ucce&s;s would be apt to in&s;pire fal&s;e opinions; which it might require a long cour&s;e of &s;ub&s;equent expe|rience to correct. Nece&s;&s;ity, e&s;pecially in politics, often occa&s;ions fal&s;e hopes, fal&s;e rea&s;onings and a &s;y&s;tem of mea&s;ures, corre&s;pondently erroneous. But even if this &s;uppo&s;ed exce&s;s &s;hould not be a con&s;e|quence of the limitation of the federal power of taxa|tion, the inequalities &s;poken of would &s;till en&s;ue, though not in the &s;ame degree, from the other cau&s;es that have been noticed. Let us now return to the examination of objections.</P>
<P>One which, if we may judge from the frequency of its repetition, &s;eems mo&s;t to be relied on, is that the hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives is not &s;ufficiently numerous for the reception of all the different cla&s;&s;es of citizens; in order to combine the intere&s;ts and feelings of every part of the community, and to produce a true &s;ympathy between the repre&s;entative body and its con&s;tituents. This argument pre&s;ents it&s;elf under a very &s;pecious and &s;educing form; and is well calculated to lay hold of the prejudices of tho&s;e to whom it is addre&s;&s;ed. But when we come to di&s;&s;ect it with attention, it will appear to be made up of nothing but fair &s;ounding words. The object it &s;eems to aim at is in the fir&s;t place impracticable, and in the &s;en&s;e in which it is contended for is unnece&s;&s;ary. I re&s;erve for another place the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the que&s;tion which relates to the &s;ufficiency of the repre&s;entative body in re&s;pect to numbers; and &s;hall content my&s;elf with examining here the particular u&s;e which has been made of a con|trary &s;uppo&s;ition in reference to the immediate &s;ubject of our inquiries.</P>
<P>The idea of an actual repre&s;entation of all cla&s;&s;es of the people by per&s;ons of each cla&s;s is altogether
<PB N="216" REF="021127_0221_0FB23DF111239E78">
vi&s;ionary. Unle&s;s it were expre&s;sly provided in the con&s;titution that each different occupation &s;hould &s;end one or more members, the thing would never take place in practice. Mechanics and manufacturers will always be inclined with few exceptions to give their votes to merchants in preference to per&s;ons of their own profe&s;&s;ions or trades. Tho&s;e di&s;cerning citizens are well aware that the mechanic and manu|facturing arts furni&s;h the materials of mercantile enterpri&s;e and indu&s;try. Many of them indeed are immediately connected with the operations of com|merce. They know that the merchant is their natural patron and friend; and they are aware that however great the confidence they may ju&s;tly feel in their own good &s;en&s;e, their intere&s;ts can be more effectually promoted by the merchant than by them&s;elves. They are &s;en&s;ible that their habits in life have not been &s;uch as to give them tho&s;e acquired endowments, without which in a deliberative a&s;&s;embly the greate&s;t natural abilities are for the mo&s;t part u&s;ele&s;s; and that the influence and weight and &s;uperior acquire|ments of the merchants, render them more equal to a conte&s;t with any &s;pirit which might happen to infu&s;e it&s;elf into the public councils unfriendly to the manu|facturing and trading intere&s;ts. The&s;e con&s;iderations, and many others that might be mentioned, prove, and experience confirms it, that artizans and manu|facturers, will commonly be di&s;po&s;ed to be&s;tow their votes upon merchants and tho&s;e whom they recom|mend. We mu&s;t therefore con&s;ider merchants as the natural repre&s;entatives of all the&s;e cla&s;&s;es of the community.</P>
<P>With regard to the learned profe&s;&s;ions, little need be ob&s;erved; they truly form no di&s;tinct intere&s;t in &s;ociety; and according to their &s;ituation and talents will be indi&s;criminately the objects of the confi|dence and choice of each other, and of other parts of the community.</P>
<P><PB N="217" REF="021127_0222_0FB23DF288B7EF00">Nothing remains but the landed intere&s;t; and this in a political view, and particularly in relation to taxes I take to be perfectly united from the wealthie&s;t landlord to the poore&s;t tenant. No tax can be laid on land which will not affect the propietor of millions of acres as well as the proprietor of a &s;ingle acre. Every land-holder will therefore have a common inte|re&s;t to keep the taxes on land as low as po&s;&s;ible; and common intere&s;t may always be reckoned upon as the &s;ure&s;t bond of &s;ympathy. But if we even could &s;uppo&s;e a di&s;tinction of intere&s;t between the opulent land-holder and the middling farmer, what rea&s;on is there to conclude that the fir&s;t would &s;tand a better chance of being deputed to the national legi&s;lature than the la&s;t? If we take fact as our guide, and look into our own &s;enate and a&s;&s;embly we &s;hall find that moderate proprietors of land prevail in both; nor is this le&s;s the ca&s;e in the &s;enate, which con&s;i&s;ts of a &s;maller number than in the a&s;&s;embly, which is com|po&s;ed of a greater number. Where the qualifications of the electors are the &s;ame, whether they have to choo&s;e a &s;mall or a large number their votes will fall upon tho&s;e in whom they have mo&s;t confidence; whether the&s;e happen to be men of large fortunes or of moderate property or of no property at all.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid to be nece&s;&s;ary that all cla&s;&s;es of citizens &s;hould have &s;ome of their own number in the repre&s;en|tative body, in order that their feelings and intere&s;ts may be the better under&s;tood and attended to. But we have &s;een that this will never happen under any arrangement that leaves the votes of the people free. Where this is the ca&s;e, the repre&s;entative body, with too few exceptions to have any influence on the &s;pirit of the government will be compo&s;ed of land-holders, merchants, and men of the learned profe&s;&s;ions. But where is the danger that the intere&s;ts and feelings of the different cla&s;&s;es of citizens will not be under&s;tood or attended to by the&s;e three de&s;criptions of men? Will not the land-holder know and feel whatever will
<PB N="218" REF="021127_0223_0FB23DF408976AC8">
promote or injure the intere&s;ts of landed property? and will he not from his own intere&s;t in that &s;pecies of property be &s;ufficiently prone to re&s;i&s;t every attempt to prejudice or encumber it? Will not the merchant under&s;tand and be di&s;po&s;ed to cultivate as far as may be proper the intere&s;ts of the mechanic and manufac|turing arts to which his commerce is &s;o nearly allied? Will not the man of the learned profe&s;&s;ion, who will feel a neutrality to the rival&s;hips between the different branches of indu&s;try, be likely to prove an impartial arbiter between them, ready to promote either, &s;o far as it &s;hall appear to him conducive to the general intere&s;ts of the &s;ociety?</P>
<P>If we take into the account the momentary humours or di&s;po&s;itions which may happen to prevail in parti|cular parts of the &s;ociety, and to which a wi&s;e admini|&s;tration will never be inattentive, is the man who&s;e &s;ituation leads to exten&s;ive inquiry and information le&s;s likely to be a competent judge of their nature, extent and foundation than one who&s;e ob&s;ervation does not travel beyond the circle of his neighbours and acquaintances? Is it not natural that a man who is a candidate for the favour of the people, and who is dependent on the &s;uffrages of his fellow-citizens for the continuance of his public honors &s;hould take care to inform him&s;elf of their di&s;po&s;itions and inclinations and &s;hould be willing to allow them their proper degree of influence upon his conduct. This dependence, and the nece&s;&s;ity of being bound him&s;elf and his po&s;terity by the laws to which he gives his a&s;&s;ent are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">, and they are the &s;trong chords of &s;ympathy between the repre&s;entative and the con&s;tituent.</P>
<P>There is no part of the admini&s;tration of govern|ment that requires exten&s;ive information and a thorough knowledge of the principles of political economy &s;o much as the bu&s;ine&s;s of taxation. The man who under&s;tands tho&s;e principles be&s;t will be lea&s;t likely to re&s;ort to oppre&s;&s;ive expedients, or to &s;acrifice any particular cla&s;s of citizens to the procurement of

revenue. It might be demon&s;trated that the mo&s;t productive &s;y&s;tem of finance will always be the lea&s;t burthen&s;ome. There can be no doubt that in order to a judicious exerci&s;e of the power of taxation, it is nece&s;&s;ary that the per&s;on in who&s;e hands it is &s;hould be acquainted with the general genius, habits and modes of thinking of the people at large and with the re&s;ources of the country. And this is all that can be rea&s;onably meant by a knowledge of the intere&s;ts and feelings of the people. In any other &s;en&s;e the propo&s;ition has either no meaning, or an ab&s;urd one.

<P>WE have &s;een that the re&s;ult of the ob&s;ervations, to which the foregoing number has been principally devoted, is that from the natural operation of the different intere&s;ts and views of the various cla&s;&s;es of the community, whether the repre&s;entation of the people be more or le&s;s numerous, it will con&s;i&s;t almo&s;t entirely of proprietors of land, of merchants and of members of the learned profe&s;&s;ions, who will truly repre&s;ent all tho&s;e different intere&s;ts and views. If it &s;hould be objected that we have &s;een other de&s;criptions of men in the local legi&s;latures; I an&s;wer, that it is admitted there are exceptions to the rule, but not in &s;ufficient number to influence the general complexion or character of the government. There are &s;trong minds in every walk of life that will ri&s;e &s;uperior to the di&s;advantages of &s;ituation, and will command the

tribute due to their merit, not only from the cla&s;&s;es to which they particularly belong, but from the &s;ociety in general. The door ought to be equally open to all; and I tru&s;t, for the credit of human nature, that we &s;hall &s;ee examples of &s;uch vigorous plants flouri&s;hing in the &s;oil of federal, as well as of &s;tate legi&s;lation; but occa&s;ional in&s;tances of this &s;ort, will not render the rea&s;oning founded upon the general cour&s;e of things le&s;s conclu&s;ive.</P>
<P>The &s;ubject might be placed in &s;everal other lights that would lead all to the &s;ame re&s;ult; and in parti|cular it might be a&s;ked, what greater affinity or relation of intere&s;t can be conceived between the carpenter and black&s;mith, and the linen manufacturer or &s;tocking weaver, than between the merchant and either of them? It is notorious, that there are often as great rival&s;hips between different branches of the mechanic or manufacturing arts, as there are between any of the departments of labour and indu&s;try; &s;o that unle&s;s the repre&s;entative body were to be far more numerous than would be con&s;i&s;tent with any idea of regularity or wi&s;dom in its deliberations, it is impo&s;&s;ible that what &s;eems to be the &s;pirit of the objection we have been con&s;idering, &s;hould ever be reali&s;ed in practice. But I forbear to dwell longer on a matter, which has hitherto worn too loo&s;e a garb to admit even of an accurate in&s;pection of its real &s;hape or tendency.</P>
<P>There is another objection of a &s;omewhat more preci&s;e nature which claims our attention. It has been a&s;&s;erted that a power of internal taxation in the national legi&s;lature could never be exerci&s;ed with advantage, as well from the want of a &s;ufficient know|ledge of local circum&s;tances as from an interference between the revenue laws of the union and of the particular &s;tates. The &s;uppo&s;ition of a want of proper knowledge, &s;eems to be entirely de&s;titute of founda|tion. If any que&s;tion is depending in a &s;tate legi&s;lature re&s;pecting one of the counties which demands a know|ledge of local details, how is it acquired? No doubt
<PB N="221" REF="021127_0226_0FB23DF888C4D3C8">
from the information of the members of the county. Cannot the like knowledge be obtained in the national legi&s;lature from the repre&s;entatives of each &s;tate? And is it not to be pre&s;umed that the men who will generally be &s;ent there, will be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the nece&s;|&s;ary degree of intelligence, to be able to communicate that information? Is the knowledge of local circum|&s;tances, as applied to taxation, a minute topographical acquaintance with all the mountains, rivers, &s;treams, highways and bye-paths in each &s;tate, or is it a general acquaintance with its &s;ituation and re&s;ources&mdash;with the &s;tate of its agriculture, commerce, manufactures&mdash; with the nature of its products and con&s;umptions&mdash; with the different degrees and kinds of its wealth, property and indu&s;try?</P>
<P>Nations in general, even under governments of the more popular kind, u&s;ually commit the admini&s;tration of their finances to &s;ingle men, or to boards compo&s;ed of a few individuals, who dige&s;t and prepare, in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, the plans of taxation; which are after|wards pa&s;&s;ed into laws by the authority of the &s;overeign or legi&s;lature. Inqui&s;itive and enlightened &s;tate&s;men are every where deemed be&s;t qualified to make a judi|cious &s;election of the objects proper for revenue; which is a clear indication, as far as the &s;en&s;e of mankind can have weight in the que&s;tion, of the &s;pecies of know|ledge of local circum&s;tances requi&s;ite to the purpo&s;es of taxation.</P>
<P>The taxes intended to be compri&s;ed under the general denomination of internal taxe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> may be &s;ub|divided into tho&s;e of the <HI>direct</HI> and tho&s;e o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the <HI>indirect</HI> kind. Though the objection be made to both, yet the rea&s;oning upon it &s;eems to be confined to the former branch. And indeed as to the latter, by which mu&s;t be under&s;tood duties and exci&s;es on articles of con&s;umption, one is at a lo&s;s to conceive what can be the nature of the difficulties apprehended. The knowledge relating to them, mu&s;t evidently be of a kind that will either be &s;ugge&s;ted by the nature of the
<PB N="222" REF="021127_0227_0FB23DFA03FC6A90">
article it&s;elf, or can ea&s;ily be procured from any well informed man, e&s;pecially of the mercantile cla&s;s. The circum&s;tances that may di&s;tingui&s;h its &s;ituation in one &s;tate from its &s;ituation in another, mu&s;t be few, &s;imple, and ea&s;y to be comprehended. The principal thing to be attended to would be to avoid tho&s;e articles which had been previou&s;ly appropriated to the u&s;e of a particular &s;tate; and there could be no difficulty in a&s;certaining the revenue &s;y&s;tem of each. This could always be known from the re&s;pective codes of laws, as well as from the information of the members of the &s;everal &s;tates.</P>
<P>The objection when applied to real property, or to hou&s;es and lands, appears to have, at fir&s;t &s;ight, more foundation; but even in this view, it will not bear a clo&s;e examination. Land taxes are commonly laid in one of two modes, either by <HI>actual</HI> valuations perma|nent or periodical, or by occa&s;ional a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ments, at the di&s;cretion or according to the be&s;t judgment of certain officers, who&s;e duty it is to make them.&mdash;In either ca&s;e the EXECUTION of the bu&s;ine&s;s, which alone requires the knowledge of local details, mu&s;t be devolved upon di&s;creet per&s;ons in the character of commi&s;&s;ioners or a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors, elected by the people or appointed by the government for the purpo&s;e. All that the law can do mu&s;t be to name the per&s;ons, or to pre&s;cribe the manner of their election or appoint|ment, to fix their numbers and qualifications; and to draw the general outlines of their powers and duties. And what is there in all this, that cannot as well be performed by the national legi&s;lature as by a &s;tate legi&s;lature? The attention of either can only reach to general principles; local details, as already ob&s;erved, mu&s;t be referred to tho&s;e who are to execute the plan.</P>
<P>But there is a &s;imple point of view in which this matter may be placed, that mu&s;t be altogether &s;atis|factory. The national legi&s;lature can make u&s;e of the <HI>&s;y&s;tem of each &s;tate within that &s;tate.</HI> The method of laying and collecting this &s;pecies of taxes in each &s;tate,
<PB N="223" REF="021127_0228_0FB23DFB863877E0">
can, in all its parts, be adopted and employed by the federal government.</P>
<P>Let it be recollected, that the proportion of the&s;e taxes is not to be left to the di&s;cretion of the national legi&s;lature: but is to be determined by the numbers of each &s;tate, as de&s;cribed in the &s;econd &s;ection of the fir&s;t article. An actual cen&s;us or enumeration of the people mu&s;t furni&s;h the rule; a circum&s;tance which effectually &s;huts the door to partiality or oppre&s;&s;ion. The abu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e of this power of taxation &s;eems to have been provided again&s;t with guarded circum&s;pection. In addition to the precaution ju&s;t mentioned, there is a provi&s;ion that
<Q>all duties, impo&s;ts, and exci&s;es, &s;hall be UNIFORM throughout the United States.</Q></P>
<P>It has been very properly ob&s;erved by different &s;peakers and writers on the &s;ide of the con&s;titution, that if the exerci&s;e of the power of internal taxation by the union, &s;hould be judged beforehand upon mature con&s;ideration, or &s;hould be di&s;covered on expe|riment, to be really inconvenient, the federal govern|ment may forbear the u&s;e of it, and have recour&s;e to requi&s;itions in its &s;tead. By way of an&s;wer to this, it has been triumphantly a&s;ked, why not in the fir&s;t in&s;tance omit that ambiguous power and rely upon the latter re&s;ource? Two &s;olid an&s;wers may be given; the fir&s;t is, that the actual exerci&s;e of the power, may be found both <HI>convenient</HI> and <HI>nece&s;&s;ary</HI>; for it is impo&s;|&s;ible to prove in theory or otherwi&s;e, than by the experiment that it cannot be advantageou&s;ly exerci&s;ed. The contrary indeed appears mo&s;t probable. The &s;econd an&s;wer is, that the exi&s;tence of &s;uch a power in the con&s;titution, will have a &s;trong influence in giving efficacy to requi&s;itions. When the &s;tates know that the union can &s;upply it&s;elf without their agency, it will be a powerful motive for exertion on their part.</P>
<P>As to the interference of the revenue laws of the union, and of its members; we have already &s;een that there can be no cla&s;hing or repugnancy of authority. The laws cannot therefore in a legal &s;en&s;e, interfere
<PB N="224" REF="021127_0229_0FB23DFD04460268">
with each other; and it is far from impo&s;&s;ible to avoid an interference even in the policy of their different &s;y&s;tems. An effectual expedient for this purpo&s;e will be mutually to ab&s;tain from tho&s;e objects, which either &s;ide may have fir&s;t had recour&s;e to. As neither can <HI>controul</HI> the other, each will have an obvious and &s;en&s;ible intere&s;t in this reciprocal forbearance. And where there is an <HI>immediate</HI> common intere&s;t, we may &s;afely count upon its operation. When the particular debts of the &s;tates are done away, and their expences come to be limited within their natural compa&s;s, the po&s;&s;ibility almo&s;t of interference will vani&s;h. A &s;mall land tax will an&s;wer the purpo&s;es of the &s;tates, and will be their mo&s;t &s;imple and mo&s;t fit re&s;ource.</P>
<P>Many &s;pectres have been rai&s;ed out of this power of internal taxation, to excite the apprehen&s;ions of the people&mdash;double &s;ets of revenue officers&mdash;a dupli|cation of their burthens by double taxations, and the frightful forms of odious and oppre&s;&s;ive poll-taxes, have been played off with all the ingenious dexterity of political legerdemain.</P>
<P>As to the fir&s;t point, there are two ca&s;es in which there can be no room for double &s;ets of officers; one where the right of impo&s;ing the tax is exclu&s;ively ve&s;ted in the union, which applies to the duties on imports; the other, where the object has not fallen under any &s;tate regulation or provi&s;ion, which may be applicable to a variety of objects. In other ca&s;es, the probabi|lity is, that the United States will either wholly ab&s;tain from the objects pre-occupied for local purpo&s;es, or will make u&s;e of the &s;tate officers and &s;tate regulations, for collecting the additional impo&s;ition. This will be&s;t an&s;wer the views of revenue, becau&s;e it will &s;ave ex|pence in the collection, and will be&s;t avoid any occa&s;ion of di&s;gu&s;t to the &s;tate governments and to the people. At all events, here is a practicable expedient for avoiding &s;uch an inconvenience; and nothing more can be required than to &s;how that evils predicted do not nece&s;&s;arily re&s;ult from the plan.</P>
<P><PB N="225" REF="021127_0230_0FB23DFE83F78890">As to any argument derived from a &s;uppo&s;ed &s;y&s;tem of influence, it is a &s;ufficient an&s;wer to &s;ay, that it ought not to be pre&s;umed; but the &s;uppo&s;ition is &s;u&s;cep|tible of a more preci&s;e an&s;wer. If &s;uch a &s;pirit &s;hould infe&s;t the councils of the union, the mo&s;t certain road to the accompli&s;hment of its aim would be to employ the &s;tate officers as much as po&s;&s;ible, and to attach them to the union by an accumulation of their emo|luments. This would &s;erve to turn the tide of &s;tate influence into the channels of the national government, in&s;tead of making federal influence flow in an oppo&s;ite and adver&s;e current. But all &s;uppo&s;itions of this kind are invidious, and ought to be bani&s;hed from the con&s;ideration of the great que&s;tion before the people. They can an&s;wer no other end than to ca&s;t a mi&s;t over the truth.</P>
<P>As to the &s;ugge&s;tion of double taxation, the an&s;wer is plain. The wants of the union are to be &s;upplied in one way or another; if to be done by the authority of the federal government, it will not be to be done by that of the &s;tate governments. The quantity of taxes to be paid by the community, mu&s;t be the &s;ame in either ca&s;e; with this advantage, if the provi&s;ion is to be made by the union, that the capital re&s;ource of commercial impo&s;ts, which is the mo&s;t convenient branch of revenue, can be prudently improved to a much greater extent under federal than under &s;tate regulation, and of cour&s;e will render it le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary to recur to more inconvenient methods; and with this further advantage, that as far as there may be any real difficulty in the exerci&s;e of the power of internal taxation, it will impo&s;e a di&s;po&s;ition to greater care in the choice and arrangement of the means; and mu&s;t naturally tend to make it a fixed point of policy in the national admini&s;tration to go as far as may be practicable in making the luxury of the rich tributary to the public trea&s;ury, in order to dimini&s;h the nece&s;|&s;ity of tho&s;e impo&s;itions, which might create di&s;&s;atis|faction in the poorer and mo&s;t numerous cla&s;&s;es of the
<PB N="226" REF="021127_0231_0FB23E0004923A20">
&s;ociety. Happy it is when the intere&s;t which the government has in the pre&s;ervation of its own power, coincides with a proper di&s;tribution of the public burthens, and tends to guard the lea&s;t wealthy part of the community from oppre&s;&s;ion!</P>
<P>As to poll taxes, I, without &s;cruple, confe&s;s my di&s;approbation of them; and though they have pre|vailed from an early period in tho&s;e &s;tates<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The New-England &s;tates.</NOTE> which have uniformly been the mo&s;t tenacious of their rights, I &s;hould lament to &s;ee them introduced into practice under the national government. But does it follow, becau&s;e there is a power to lay them, that they will actually be laid? Every &s;tate in the union has power to impo&s;e taxes of this kind; and yet in &s;everal of them they are unknown in practice. Are the &s;tate governments to be &s;tigmati&s;ed as tyrannies becau&s;e they po&s;&s;e&s;s this power? If they are not, with what propriety can the like power ju&s;tify &s;uch a charge again&s;t the national government, or even be urged as an ob&s;tacle to its adoption? As little friendly as I am to the &s;pecies of impo&s;ition, I &s;till feel a thorough conviction, that the power of having recour&s;e to it, ought to exi&s;t in the federal government. There are certain emergencies of nations, in which expedients that in the ordinary &s;tate of things ought to be fore|born, become e&s;&s;ential to the public weal. And the government from the po&s;&s;ibility of &s;uch emergencies ought ever to have the option of making u&s;e of them. The real &s;carcity of objects in this country, which may be con&s;idered as productive &s;ources of revenue, is a rea&s;on peculiar to it&s;elf, for not abridging the di&s;cretion of the national councils in this re&s;pect. There may exi&s;t certain critical and tempe&s;tuous con|junctures of the &s;tate, in which a poll tax may become an ine&s;timable re&s;ource. And as I know nothing to exempt this portion of the globe from the common cala|mities that have befallen other parts of it, I acknow|ledge my aver&s;ion to every project that is calculated
<PB N="227" REF="021127_0232_0FB23E01856879C8">
to di&s;arm the government of a &s;ingle weapon, which in any po&s;&s;ible contingency might be u&s;efully employed for the general defence and &s;ecurity.</P>
<P>I have now gone through the examination of tho&s;e powers propo&s;ed to be conferred upon the federal government; which relate more peculiarly to its energy, and to its efficiency for an&s;wering the great and primary objects of union. There are others, which though omitted here, will in order to render the view of the &s;ubject more complete, be taken notice of under the next head of our enquiries. I flatter my&s;elf the progre&s;s already made will have &s;ufficed to &s;atisfy the candid and judicious part of the community, that &s;ome of the objections which have been mo&s;t &s;trenuou&s;ly urged again&s;t the con&s;titution, and which were mo&s;t formidable in their fir&s;t appear|ance, are not only de&s;titute of &s;ub&s;tance, but if they had operated in the formation of the plan, would have rendered it incompetent to the great ends of public happine&s;s and national pro&s;perity. I equally flatter my&s;elf that a further and more critical inve&s;ti|gation of the &s;y&s;tem will &s;erve to recommend it &s;till more to every &s;incere and di&s;intere&s;ted advocate for good government; and will leave no doubt with men of this character of the propriety and expediency of adopting it. Happy will it be for our&s;elves, and mo&s;t honorable for human nature, if we have wi&s;dom and virtue enough, to &s;et &s;o glorious an example to man|kind!</P>

<HEAD>THE FEDERALIST: ADDRESSED TO THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW-YORK.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="37" TYPE="number">
<HEAD>NUMBER XXXVII. Concerning the Difficulties which the Con|vention mu&s;t have experienced in the For|mation of a proper Plan.</HEAD>
<P>IN reviewing the defects of the exi&s;ting confede|ration, and &s;hewing that they cannot be &s;upplied by a government of le&s;s energy than that before the public, &s;everal of the mo&s;t important principles of the latter fell of cour&s;e under con&s;ideration. But as the ultimate object of the&s;e papers is to determine clearly and fully the merits of this con&s;titution, and the expediency of adopting it, our plan cannot be compleated without taking a more critical and thorough &s;urvey of the work of the convention; without examining it on all its &s;ides; comparing it in all its parts, and calculating its probable effects. That this remaining ta&s;k may be executed under impre&s;&s;ions conducive to a ju&s;t and fair re&s;ult, &s;ome reflections mu&s;t in this place be indulged, which candour previou&s;ly &s;ugge&s;ts. It is a misfortune, in&s;eparable from human affairs, that public mea&s;ures

are rarely inve&s;tigated with that &s;pirit of moderation which is e&s;&s;ential to a ju&s;t e&s;timate of their real ten|dency to advance or ob&s;truct the public good; and that this &s;pirit is more apt to be dimini&s;hed than promoted, by tho&s;e occa&s;ions which require an unu&s;ual exerci&s;e of it. To tho&s;e who have been led by experience to attend to this con&s;ideration, it could not appear &s;urpri&s;ing, that the act of the convention which recommends &s;o many important changes and innovations, which may be viewed in &s;o many lights and relations, and which touches the &s;prings of &s;o many pa&s;&s;ions and intere&s;ts, &s;hould find or excite di&s;po&s;itions unfriendly both on one &s;ide, and on the other, to a fair di&s;cu&s;&s;ion and accurate judg|ment of its merits. In &s;ome, it has been too evident from their own publications, that they have &s;canned the propo&s;ed con&s;titution, not only with a predi&s;|po&s;ition to cen&s;ure; but with a predetermination to condemn: As the language held by others betrays an oppo&s;ite predetermination or bias, which mu&s;t render their opinions al&s;o of little moment in the que&s;tion. In placing however, the&s;e different cha|racters on a level, with re&s;pect to the weight of their opinions, I wi&s;h not to in&s;inuate that there may not be a material difference in the purity of their intentions. It is but ju&s;t to remark in favor of the latter de&s;crip|tion, that as our &s;ituation is univer&s;ally admitted to be peculiarly critical, and to require indi&s;pen&s;ibly, that &s;omething &s;hould be done for our relief, the pre|determined patron of what has been actually done, may have taken his bias from the weight of the&s;e con&s;iderations, as well as from con&s;iderations of a &s;ini&s;ter nature. The predetermined adver&s;ary on the other hand, can have been governed by no venial motive whatever. The intentions of the fir&s;t may be upright, as they may on the contrary be culpable. The views of the la&s;t cannot be upright, and mu&s;t be culpable. But the truth i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, that the&s;e papers are not addre&s;&s;ed to per&s;ons falling under either of the&s;e

characters. They &s;olicit the attention of tho&s;e only, who add to a &s;incere zeal for the happine&s;s of their country, a temper favorable to a ju&s;t e&s;timate of the means of promoting it.</P>
<P>Per&s;ons of this character will proceed to an exami|nation of the plan &s;ubmitted by the convention, not only without a di&s;po&s;ition to find or to magnify faults; but will &s;ee the propriety of reflecting that a faultle&s;s plan was not to be expected. Nor will they barely make allowances for the errors which may be chargeable on the fallibility to which the conven|tion, as a body of men, were liable; but will keep in mind that they them&s;elves al&s;o are but men, and ought not to a&s;&s;ume an infallibility in rejudging the fallible opinions of others.</P>
<P>With equal readine&s;s will it be perceived, that be&s;ides the&s;e inducements to candour, many allow|ances ought to be made for the difficulties inherent in the very nature of the undertaking referred to the convention.</P>
<P>The novelty of the undertaking immediately &s;trikes us. It has been &s;hewn in the cour&s;e of the&s;e papers, that the exi&s;ting confederation is founded on prin|ciples which are fallacious; that we mu&s;t con&s;equently change this fir&s;t foundation, and with it, the &s;uper-&s;tructure re&s;ting upon it. It has been &s;hewn, that the other confederacies which could be con&s;ulted as pre|cedents, have been viciated by the &s;ame erroneous principles, and can therefore furni&s;h no other light than that of beacons, which give warning of the cour&s;e to be &s;hunned, without pointing out that which ought to be pur&s;ued. The mo&s;t that the convention could do in &s;uch a &s;ituation, was to avoid the errors &s;ugge&s;ted by the pa&s;t experience of other countries, as well as of our own; and to provide a convenient mode of rectifying their own errors, as future expe|rience may unfold them.</P>
<P>Among the difficulties encountered by the conven|tion, a very important one mu&s;t have lain, in com|bining
<PB N="4" REF="021127_0241_0FB23E0F03647820">
the requi&s;ite &s;tability and energy in govern|ment with the inviolable attention due to liberty, and to the republican form. Without &s;ub&s;tantially accompli&s;hing this part of their undertaking, they would have very imperfectly fulfilled the object of their appointment, or the expectation of the public: Yet, that it could not be ea&s;ily accompli&s;hed, will be denied by no one, who is unwilling to betray his ignorance of the &s;ubject. Energy in government is e&s;&s;ential to that &s;ecurity again&s;t external and internal danger, and to that prompt and &s;alutary execution of the laws, which enter into the very definition of good government. Stability in government, is e&s;&s;ential to national character, and to the advantages annexed to it, as well as to that repo&s;e and confidence in the minds of the people, which are among the chief ble&s;&s;|ings of civil &s;ociety. An irregular and mutable legi&s;lation is not more an evil in it&s;elf, than it is odious to the people; and it may be pronounced with a&s;&s;urance, that the people of this country, enlightened as they are, with regard to the nature, and intere&s;ted, as the great body of them are, in the effects of good government will never be &s;atisfied, till &s;ome remedy be applied to the vici&s;&s;itudes and uncertainties, which characterize the &s;tate admini|&s;trations. On comparing, however the&s;e valuable ingredients with the vital principles of liberty, we mu&s;t perceive at once, the difficulty of mingling them together in their due prop<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rtions. The genius of republican liberty, &s;eems to demand on one &s;ide, not only, that all power &s;hould be derived from the people; but, that tho&s;e entru&s;ted with it &s;hould be kept in dependence on the people, by a &s;hort dura|tion of their appointments; and, that, even during this &s;hort period, the tru&s;t &s;hould be placed not in a few, but in a number of hands. Stability, on the contrary, requires, that the hands, in which power is lodged, &s;hould continue for a length of time the &s;ame. A frequent change of men will re&s;ult from a

frequent return of electors, and a frequent change of mea&s;ures, from a frequent change of men; whil&s;t energy in government requires not only a certain duration of power, but the execution of it by a &s;ingle hand. How far the convention may have &s;ucceeded in this part of their work, will better appear on a more accurate view of it. From the cur&s;ory view, here taken, it mu&s;t clearly appear to have been an arduous part.</P>
<P>Not le&s;s arduous mo&s;t have been the ta&s;k of mark|ing the proper line of partition, between the authority of the general, and that of the &s;tate governments. Every man will be &s;en&s;ible of this difficulty, in pro|portion as he has been accu&s;tomed to contemplate and di&s;criminate objects, exten&s;ive and complicated in their nature. The faculties of the mind it&s;elf have never yet been di&s;tingui&s;hed and defined, with &s;ati&s;|factory preci&s;ion, by all the efforts of the mo&s;t acute and metaphy&s;ical philo&s;ophers. Sen&s;e, perception, judgment, de&s;ire, volition, memory, imagination, are found to be &s;eparated, by &s;uch delicate &s;hades and minute gradations, that their boundaries have eluded the mo&s;t &s;ubtle inve&s;tigations, and remain a pregnant &s;ource of ingenious di&s;qui&s;ition and con|trover&s;y. The boundaries between the great king|doms of nature, and &s;till more, between the various provinces, and le&s;&s;er portions, into which they are &s;ubdivided, afford another illu&s;tration of the &s;ame important truth. The mo&s;t &s;agacious and laborious naturali&s;ts have never yet &s;ucceeded, in tracing with certainty, the line which &s;eparates the di&s;trict of vegetable life from the neighbouring region of unor|ganized matter, or which marks the termination of the former and the commencement of the animal empire. A &s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ll greater ob&s;curity lies in the di&s;|tinctive characters, by which the objects in each of the&s;e great departments of nature have been arranged and a&s;&s;orted. When we pa&s;s from the works of nature, in which all the delineations are perfectly

accurate, and appear to be otherwi&s;e only from the imperfection of the eye which &s;urveys them, to the in&s;titutions of man, in which the ob&s;curity ari&s;es as well from the object it&s;elf, as from the organ by which it is contemplated; we mu&s;t perceive the nece&s;&s;ity of moderating &s;till farther our expectations and hopes from the efforts of human &s;agacity. Expe|rience has in&s;tructed us that no &s;kill in the &s;cience of government has yet been able to di&s;criminate and define, with &s;ufficient certainty, its three great pro|vinces, the legi&s;lative, executive and judiciary; or even the privileges and powers of the different legi&s;|lative branches. Que&s;tions daily occur in the cour&s;e of practice, which prove the ob&s;curity which reigns in the&s;e &s;ubjects, and which puzzles the greate&s;t adepts in political &s;cience. The experience of ages, with the continued and combined labors of the mo&s;t enlightened legi&s;lators and juri&s;ts, have been equally un&s;ucce&s;sful in delineating the &s;everal objects and limits of different codes of laws and different tri|bunals of ju&s;tice. The preci&s;e extent of the common law, the &s;tatute law, the maritime law, the eccle&s;i|a&s;tical law, the law of corporations and other local laws and cu&s;toms, remain &s;till to be clearly and finally e&s;tabli&s;hed in Great Britain, where accuracy in &s;uch &s;ubjects has been more indu&s;triou&s;ly pur&s;ued than in any other part of the world. The juri&s;diction of her &s;everal courts, general and local, of law, of equity, of admiralty, &amp;c. is not le&s;s a &s;ource of fre|quent and intricate di&s;cu&s;&s;ions, &s;ufficiently denoting the indeterminate limits by which they are re&s;pec|tively circum&s;cribed. All new laws, though penned with the greate&s;t technical &s;kill, and pa&s;&s;ed on the fulle&s;t and mo&s;t mature deliberation, are con&s;idered as more or le&s;s ob&s;cure and equivocal, until their meaning be liquidated and a&s;certained by a &s;eries of particular di&s;cu&s;&s;ions and adjudications. Be&s;ides the ob&s;curity ari&s;ing from the complexity of objects, and the imperfection of the human faculties, the medium
<PB N="7" REF="021127_0244_0FB23E138560BD50">
through which the conceptions of men are conveyed to each other, adds a fre&s;h embarra&s;ment. The u&s;e of words is to expre&s;s ideas. Per&s;picuity therefore requires not only that the ideas &s;hould be di&s;tinctly formed, but that they &s;hould be expre&s;&s;ed by words di&s;tinctly and exclu&s;ively appropriated to them. But no language is &s;o copious as to &s;upply words and phra&s;es for every complex idea, or &s;o correct as not to include many equivocally denoting different ideas. Hence it mu&s;t happen, that however accurately objects may be di&s;criminated in them&s;elves, and however accurately the di&s;crimination may be con|&s;idered, the definition of them may be rendered inaccurate by the inaccuracy of the terms in which it is delivered. And this unavoidable inaccuracy mu&s;t be greater or le&s;s, according to the complexity and novelty of the objects defined. When the Almighty him&s;elf conde&s;cends to addre&s;s mankind in their own language, his meaning luminous as it mu&s;t be, is rendered dim and doubtful, by the cloudy medium through which it is communicated. Here then are three &s;ources of vague and incorrect definitions; indi&s;tinctne&s;s of the object, imperfection of the organ of conception, inadequatene&s;s of the vehicle of ideas. Any one of the&s;e mu&s;t produce a certain degree of ob&s;curity. The convention, in delineating the boun|dary between the federal and &s;tate juri&s;dictions, mu&s;t have experienced the full effect of them all.</P>
<P>To the difficulties already mentioned, may be added the interfering preten&s;ions of the larger and &s;maller &s;tates. We cannot err in &s;uppo&s;ing that the former would contend for a participation in the government, fully proportioned to their &s;uperior wealth and importance; and that the latter would not be le&s;s tenacious of the equality at pre&s;ent enjoyed by them. We may well &s;uppo&s;e that neither &s;ide would entirely yield to the other, and con&s;equently that the &s;truggle could be terminated only by com|promi&s;e. It is extremely probable al&s;o, that after
<PB N="8" REF="021127_0245_0FB23E150348DDB8">
the ratio of repre&s;entation had been adju&s;ted, this very compromi&s;e mu&s;t have produced a fre&s;h &s;truggle between the &s;ame parties, to give &s;uch a turn to the organization of the government, and to the di&s;tri|bution of its powers, as would increa&s;e the impor|tance of the branches, in forming which they had re&s;pectively obtained the greate&s;t &s;hare of influence. There are features in the con&s;titution which warrant each of the&s;e &s;uppo&s;itions; and as far as either of them is well founded, it &s;hews that the convention mu&s;t have been compelled to &s;acrifice theoretical pro|priety to the force of extraneous con&s;iderations.</P>
<P>Nor could it have been the large and &s;mall &s;tates only which would mar&s;hal them&s;elves in oppo&s;ition to each other on various poin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s. Other combinations, re&s;ulting from a difference of local po&s;ition and policy, mu&s;t have created additional difficulties. As every &s;tate may be divided into different di&s;tricts, and its citizens into different cla&s;&s;es, which give birth to contending intere&s;ts and local jealou&s;ies; &s;o the different parts of the United States are di&s;tin|gui&s;hed from each other, by a variety of circum|&s;tances, which produce a like effect on a larger &s;cale. And although this variety of intere&s;ts, for rea&s;ons &s;ufficiently explained in a former paper, may have a &s;alutary influence on the admini&s;tration of the govern|ment when formed; yet every one mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible of the contrary influence which mu&s;t have been expe|rienced in the ta&s;k of forming it.</P>
<P>Would it be wonderful if under the pre&s;&s;ure of all the&s;e difficulties, the convention &s;hould have been forced into &s;ome deviations from that artificial &s;truc|ture and regular &s;ymmetry, which an ab&s;tract view of the &s;ubject might lead an ingenious theori&s;t to be&s;tow on a con&s;titution planned in his clo&s;et or in his imagination? The real wonder is, that &s;o many difficulties &s;hould have been &s;urmounted; and &s;ur|mounted with an unanimity almo&s;t as unprecedented as it mu&s;t have been unexpected. It is impo&s;&s;ible for
<PB N="9" REF="021127_0246_0FB23E168384B608">
any man of candor to reflect on this circum&s;tance, without partaking of the a&s;toni&s;hment. It is impo&s;|&s;ible for the man of pious reflection not to perceive in it, a finger of that Almighty Hand which has been &s;o frequently and &s;ignally extended to our relief in the critical &s;tages of the revolution. We had occa&s;ion in a former paper, to take notice of the repeated trials which have been un&s;ucce&s;sfully made in the United Netherlands, for reforming the baneful and notorious vices of their con&s;titution. The hi&s;tory of almo&s;t all the great councils and con&s;ultations, held among mankind for reconciling their di&s;cordant opinions, a&s;&s;uaging their mutual jealou&s;ies, and adju&s;ting their re&s;pective intere&s;ts, is a hi&s;tory of factions, contentions and di&s;appointments; and may be cla&s;&s;ed among the mo&s;t dark and degrading pic|tures which di&s;play the infirmities and depravities of the human character. If, in a few &s;cattered in&s;tances, a brighter a&s;pect is pre&s;ented, they &s;erve only as exceptions to admoni&s;h us of the general truth; and by their lu&s;tre to darken the gloom of the adver&s;e pro&s;pect to which they are contra&s;ted. In revolving the cau&s;es from which the&s;e exceptions re&s;ult, and applying them to the particular in&s;tance before us, we are nece&s;&s;arily led to two important conclu&s;ions. The fir&s;t is, that the convention mu&s;t have enjoyed in a very &s;ingular degree, an exemption from the pe&s;tilential influence of party animo&s;ities; the di&s;ea&s;es mo&s;t incident to deliberative bodies, and mo&s;t apt to contaminate their proceedings. The &s;econd con|clu&s;ion is, that all the deputations compo&s;ing the convention, were either &s;atisfactorily accommodated by the final act; or were induced to accede to it, by a deep conviction of the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;acrificing private opinions and partial intere&s;ts, to the public good, and by a de&s;pair of &s;eeing this nece&s;&s;ity dimini&s;hed by delays or by new experiments.</P>

<HEAD>NUMBER XXXVIII. The Subject continued, and the incoherence of the Objections to the Plan expo&s;ed.</HEAD>
<P>IT is not a little remarkable that in every ca&s;e reported by antient hi&s;tory, in which government has been e&s;tabli&s;hed with deliberation and con&s;ent, the ta&s;k of framing it has not been committed to an a&s;&s;embly of men; but has been performed by &s;ome individual citizen of pre-eminent wi&s;dom and approved integrity. Minos, we learn, was the pri|mitive founder of the government of Crete; as Zaleucus was of that of the Locrians. The&s;eus fir&s;t, and after him Draco and Solon, in&s;tituted the govern|ment of Athens. Lycurgus was the lawgiver of Sparta. The foundation of the original government of Rome was laid by Romulus; and the work com|pleated by two of his elective &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, Numa, and Tullus Ho&s;tilius. On the abolition of royalty, the con&s;ular admini&s;tration was &s;ub&s;tituted by Brutus, who &s;tepped forward with a project for &s;uch a reform, which he alledged had been prepared by Servius Tullius, and to which his addre&s;s obtained the a&s;&s;ent and ratification of the &s;enate and people. This remark is applicable to confederate governments al&s;o. Amphyction, we are told, was the author of that which bore his name. The Achaean league received its fir&s;t birth from Achaeus, and its &s;econd from Aratus. What degree of agency the&s;e reputed lawgivers might have in their re&s;pective e&s;tabli&s;h|ments, or how far they might be cloathed with the legitimate authority of the people, cannot in every in&s;tance be a&s;certained. In &s;ome, however, the pro|ceeding was &s;trictly regular. Draco appears to have been entru&s;ted by the people of Athens, with inde|finite powers to reform its government and laws.
<PB N="11" REF="021127_0248_0FB23E19830B6F28">
And Solon, according to Plutarch, was in a manner compelled by the univer&s;al &s;uffrage of his fellow citizens, to take upon him the &s;ole and ab&s;olute power of new modelling the con&s;titution. The pro|ceedings under Lycurgus were le&s;s regular; but as far as the advocates for a regular reform could prevail, they all turned their eyes towards the &s;ingle efforts of that celebrated patriot and &s;age, in&s;tead of &s;eeking to bring about a revolution, by the intervention of a deliberative body of citizens. Whence could it have proceeded that a people, jealous as the Greeks were of their liberty, &s;hould &s;o far abandon the rules of caution, as to place their de&s;tiny in the hands of a &s;ingle citizen? Whence could it have proceeded that the Athenians, a people who would not &s;uffer an army to be commanded by fewer than ten generals, and who required no other proof of danger to their liberties than the illu&s;trious merit of a fellow citizen, &s;hould con&s;ider one illu&s;trious citizen as a more eligible depo&s;itary of the fortunes of them&s;elves and their po&s;terity, than a &s;elect body of citizens, from who&s;e common deliberations more wi&s;dom, as well as more &s;afety, might have been expected? The&s;e que&s;tions cannot be fully an&s;wered without &s;uppo&s;ing that the fears of di&s;cord and di&s;union among a number of coun&s;ellors, exceeded the apprehen&s;ion of treachery or incapacity in a &s;ingle individual. Hi&s;tory informs us likewi&s;e of the difficulties with which the&s;e cele|brated reformers had to contend; as well as of the expedients which they were obliged to employ, in order to carry their reforms into effect. Solon, who &s;eems to have indulged a more tempori&s;ing policy, confe&s;&s;ed that he had not given to his countrymen the government be&s;t &s;uited to their happine&s;s, but mo&s;t tolerable to their prejudices. And Lycurgus, more true to his object, was under the nece&s;&s;ity of mixing a portion of violence with the authority of &s;uper&s;tition; and of &s;ecuring his final &s;ucce&s;s, by a voluntary renunciation, fir&s;t of his country, and then
<PB N="12" REF="021127_0249_0FB23E1B09A58738">
of his life. If the&s;e le&s;&s;ons teach us, on one hand, to admire the improvement made by America on the ancient mode of preparing and e&s;tabli&s;hing regular plans of government; they &s;erve not le&s;s on the other, to admoni&s;h us of the hazards and difficulties incident to &s;uch experiments, and of the great imprudence of unnece&s;&s;arily multiplying them.</P>
<P>Is it an unrea&s;onable co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">jecture that the errors which may be contained in the plan of the convention are &s;uch as have re&s;ulted rather from the defect of antecedent experience on this complicated and difficult &s;ubject, than from a want of accuracy or care in the inve&s;tigation of it; and con&s;equently &s;uch as will not be a&s;certained until an actual trial &s;hall have pointed them out? This conjecture is rendered probable not only by many con&s;iderations of a general nature, but by the particular ca&s;e of the articles of confederation. It is ob&s;ervable that among the numerous objections and amendments &s;ugge&s;ted by the &s;everal &s;tates, when the&s;e articles were &s;ubmitted for their ratification, not one is found which alludes to the great and radical error, which on actual trial has di&s;covered it&s;elf. And if we except the ob&s;ervations which New-Jer&s;ey was led to make rather by her local &s;itu|ation than by her peculiar fore&s;ight, it may be que&s;|tioned whether a &s;ingle &s;ugge&s;tion was of &s;ufficient moment to ju&s;tify a revi&s;ion of the &s;y&s;tem. There is abundant rea&s;on neverthele&s;s to &s;uppo&s;e that imma|terial as the&s;e objections were, they would have been adhered to with a very dangerous inflexibility in &s;ome &s;tates, had not a zeal for their opinions and &s;uppo&s;ed intere&s;ts, been &s;tifled by the more powerful &s;entiment of &s;elf-pre&s;ervation.

The phy&s;icians attend: The ca&s;e of the patient is carefully examined: a con&s;ultation is held.

Let them &s;peak for them&s;elves. This one tells us that the propo&s;ed con&s;titution ought to be rejected, becau&s;e it is not a confederation of the &s;tates, but a government over individuals. Another admits that it ought to be a government over indivi|duals, to a certain extent, but by no means to the extent propo&s;ed. A third does not object to the government over individuals or to the extent propo&s;ed, but to the want of a bill of rights. A fourth concurs in the ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of a bill of rights, but contends that it ought to be declaratory not of the per&s;onal rights of individuals, but of the rights re&s;erved to the &s;tates in their political capacity. A fifth is of opinion that a bill of rights of any &s;ort would be &s;uperfluous and mi&s;placed, and that the plan would be unexceptionable, but for the fatal power of regu|lating the times and places of election. An objector in a large &s;tate exclaims loudly again&s;t the unrea&s;onable equality of repre&s;entation in the &s;enate. An objector in a &s;mall &s;tate is equally loud again&s;t the dangerous inequality in the hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives. From this quarter we are alarmed with the amazing expence from the number of per&s;ons who are to admini&s;ter the new government. From another quarter, and &s;ome|times from the &s;ame quarter, on another occa&s;ion, the cry is, that the congre&s;s will be but the &s;hadow of a repre&s;entation, and that the government would be far le&s;s objectionable, if the number and the expence were doubled. A patriot in a &s;tate that does not import or export, di&s;cerns in&s;uperable objections again&s;t the power of direct taxation. The patriotic adver&s;ary in a &s;tate of great exports and imports, is not le&s;s di&s;&s;atisfied that the whole burthen of taxes may be thrown on con&s;umption. This politician di&s;covers in the con&s;titution a direct and irre&s;i&s;tible tendency to monarchy. That is equally &s;ure, it will
<PB N="15" REF="021127_0252_0FB23E1F8522E930">
end in ari&s;tocracy. Another is puzzled to &s;ay which of the&s;e &s;hapes it will ultimately a&s;&s;ume, but &s;ees clearly it mu&s;t be one or other of them. Whil&s;t a fourth is not wanting, who with no le&s;s confidence affirms that the con&s;titution is &s;o far from having a bias towards either of the&s;e dangers, that the weight on that &s;ide will not be &s;ufficient to keep it upright and firm again&s;t its oppo&s;ite propen&s;ities. With another cla&s;s of adver&s;aries to the con&s;titution, the language is that the legi&s;lative, executive and judiciary depart|ments are intermixed in &s;uch a manner as to contradict all the ideas of regular government, and all the requi&s;ite precautions in favour of liberty. Whil&s;t this objection circulates in vague and general expre&s;|&s;ions, there are not a few who lend their &s;anction to it. Let each one come forward with his particular explanation and &s;carce any two are exactly agreed on the &s;ubject. In the eyes of one the junction of the &s;enate with the pre&s;ident in the re&s;pon&s;ible function of appointing to offices, in&s;tead of ve&s;ting this execu|tive power in the executive, alone, is the vicious part of the organi&s;ation. To another, the exclu&s;ion of the hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives, who&s;e numbers alone could be a due &s;ecurity again&s;t corruption and partiality in the exerci&s;e of &s;uch a power, is equally obnoxious. With another, the admi&s;&s;ion of the pre&s;ident into any &s;hare of a power which mu&s;t ever be a dangerous engine in the hands of the executive magi&s;trate, is an unpardonable violation of the maxims of republican jealou&s;y. No part of the arrangement according to &s;ome is more admi&s;&s;ible than the trial of impeachments by the &s;enate, which is alternately a member both of the legi&s;lative and executive departments, when this power &s;o evidently belonged to the judiciary depart|ment. We concur fully, reply others, in the objection to this part of the plan, but we can never agree that a reference of impeachments to the judiciary authority would be an amendment of the error. Our principal di&s;like to the organi&s;ation ari&s;es from the exten&s;ive
<PB N="16" REF="021127_0253_0FB23E210432A560">
powers already lodged in that department. Even among the zealous patrons of a council of &s;tate, the mo&s;t irreconcilable variance is di&s;covered concerning the mode in which it ought to be con&s;tituted. The demand of one gentleman is that the council &s;hould con&s;i&s;t of a &s;mall number, to be appointed by the mo&s;t numerous branch of the legi&s;lature. Another would prefer a larger number, and con&s;iders it as a fundamental condition that the appointment &s;hould be made by the pre&s;ident him&s;elf.</P>
<P>As it can give no umbrage to the writers again&s;t the plan of the federal con&s;titution, let us &s;uppo&s;e that as they are the mo&s;t zealous, &s;o they are al&s;o the mo&s;t &s;agacious of tho&s;e who think the late convention were unequal to the ta&s;k a&s;&s;igned them, and that a wi&s;er and better plan might and ought to be &s;ub&s;tituted. Let us further &s;uppo&s;e that their country &s;hould concur both in this favourable opinion of their merits, and in their unfavourable opinion of the convention; and &s;hould accordingly proceed to form them into a &s;econd convention, with full powers and for the expre&s;s pur|po&s;e of revi&s;ing and remoulding the work of the fir&s;t. Were the experiment to be &s;eriou&s;ly made, though it requires &s;ome effort to view it &s;eriou&s;ly even in fiction, I leave it to be decided by the &s;ample of opinions ju&s;t exhibited, whether with all their enmity to their predece&s;&s;ors, they would in any one point depart &s;o widely from their example, as in the di&s;cord and ferment that would mark their own deliberations; and whether the con&s;titution, now before the public, would not &s;tand as fair a chance for immortality, as Lycurgus gave to that of Sparta, by making its change to depend on his own return from exile and death, if it were to be immediately adopted, and were to continue in force, not until a BETTER, but until ANOTHER &s;hould be agreed upon by this new a&s;&s;embly of law-givers.</P>
<P>It is a matter both of wonder and regret, that tho&s;e who rai&s;e &s;o many objections again&s;t the new
<PB N="17" REF="021127_0254_0FB23E2287F56E08">
con&s;titution, &s;hould never call to mind the defects of that which is to be exchanged for it. It is not nece&s;&s;ary that the former &s;hould be perfect; it is &s;ufficient that the latter is more imperfect. No man would refu&s;e to give bra&s;s for &s;ilver or gold, becau&s;e the latter had &s;ome alloy in it. No man would refu&s;e to quit a &s;hattered and tottering habitation, for a firm and commodious building, becau&s;e the latter had not a porch to it; or becau&s;e &s;ome of the rooms might be a little larger or &s;maller, or the cieling a little higher or lower than his fancy would have planned them. But waving illu&s;trations of this &s;ort, is it not mani|fe&s;t that mo&s;t of the capital objections urged again&s;t the new &s;y&s;tem, lie with tenfold weight again&s;t the exi&s;ting confederation? Is an indefinite power to rai&s;e money dangerous in the hands of a federal government? The pre&s;ent congre&s;s can make requi|&s;itions to any amount they plea&s;e; and the &s;tates are con&s;titutionally bound to furni&s;h them; they can emit bills of credit as long as they will pay for the paper; they can borrow both abroad and at home, as long as a &s;hilling will be lent. Is an indefinite power to rai&s;e troops dangerous? The confederation gives to congre&s;s that power al&s;o; and they have already begun to make u&s;e of it. Is it improper and un&s;afe to intermix the different powers of govern|ment in the &s;ame body of men? Congre&s;s, a &s;ingle body of men, are the &s;ole depo&s;itory of all the federal powers. Is it particularly dangerous to give the keys of the trea&s;ury, and the command of the army, into the &s;ame hands? The confederation places them both in the hands of congre&s;s. Is a bill of rights e&s;&s;ential to liberty? The confederation has no bill of rights. Is it an objection again&s;t the new con&s;titution, that it empowers the &s;enate with the concurence of the executive to make treaties which are to be the laws of the land? The exi&s;ting congre&s;s, without any &s;uch controul, can make treaties which they them&s;elves have declared, and mo&s;t of the &s;tates have
<PB N="18" REF="021127_0255_0FB23E240526D900">
recognized, to be the &s;upreme law of the land. Is the importation of &s;laves permitted by the new con|&s;titution for twenty years? By the old, it is permit|ted for ever.</P>
<P>I &s;hall be told that however dangerous this mixture of powers may be in theory, it is rendered harmle&s;s by the dependence of congre&s;s on the &s;tates for the means of carrying them into practice: That however large the ma&s;s of powers may be, it is in fact a lifele&s;s ma&s;s. Then &s;ay I in the fir&s;t place, that the confe|deration is chargeable with the &s;till greater folly of declaring certain powers in the federal government to be ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, and at the &s;ame time render|ing them ab&s;olutely nugatory; And in the next place, that if the union is to continue, and no better govern|ment be &s;ub&s;tituted, effective powers mu&s;t either be granted to or a&s;&s;umed by the exi&s;ting congre&s;s, in either of which events the contra&s;t ju&s;t &s;tated will hold good. But this is not all. Out of this lifele&s;s ma&s;s has already grown an excre&s;cent power, which tends to realize all the dangers that can be apprehended from a defective con&s;truction of the &s;upreme govern|ment of the union. It is now no longer a point of &s;peculation and hope that the we&s;tern territory is a mine of va&s;t wealth to the United States; and al|though it is not of &s;uch a nature as to extricate them from their pre&s;ent di&s;tre&s;&s;es, or for &s;ome time to come, to yield any regular &s;upplies for the public expences, yet mu&s;t it hereafter be able under proper manage|ment both to effect a gradual di&s;charge of the dome&s;tic debt, and to furni&s;h for a certain period, liberal tributes to the federal trea&s;ury. A very large propor|tion of this fund has been already &s;urrendered by individual &s;tates; and it may with rea&s;on be expected, that the remaining &s;tates will not per&s;i&s;t in witholding &s;imilar proofs of their equity and genero&s;ity. We may calculate therefore that a rich and fertile country, of an area equal to the inhabited extent of the United States, will &s;oon become a national &s;tock. Congre&s;s
<PB N="19" REF="021127_0256_0FB23E2583953898">
have a&s;&s;umed the admini&s;tration of this &s;tock. They have began to render it productive. Congre&s;s have undertaken to do more, they have proceeded to form new &s;tates; to erect temporary governments; to appoint officers for them; and to pre&s;cribe the con|ditions on which &s;uch &s;tates &s;hall be admitted into the confederacy. All this has been done; and done without the lea&s;t colour of con&s;titutional authority. Yet no blame has been whi&s;pered; no alarm has been &s;ounded. A GREAT and INDEPENDENT fund of revenue is pa&s;&s;ing into the hands of a SINGLE BODY of men, who can RAISE TROOPS to an INDEFINITE NUMBER, and appropriate money to their &s;upport for an INDEFINITE PERIOD OF TIME. And yet there are men who have not only been &s;ilent &s;pectators of this pro&s;pect; but who are advocates for the &s;y&s;tem which exhibits it; and at the &s;ame time urge again&s;t the new &s;y&s;tem the objections which we have heard. Would they not act with more con&s;i&s;tency in urging the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the latter, as no le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary to guard the union again&s;t the future powers and re&s;our|ces of a body con&s;tructed like the exi&s;ting congre&s;s, than to &s;ave it from the dangers threatened by the pre&s;ent impotency of that a&s;&s;embly?</P>
<P>I mean not by any thing here &s;aid to throw cen&s;ure on the mea&s;ures which have been pur&s;ued by congre&s;s. I am &s;en&s;ible they could not have done otherwi&s;e. The public intere&s;t, the nece&s;&s;ity of the ca&s;e, impo&s;ed upon them the ta&s;k of overleaping their con&s;titutional limits. But is not the fact an alarming proof of the danger re&s;ulting from a government which does not po&s;&s;e&s;s regular powers commen&s;urate to its objects? A di&s;&s;olution or u&s;urpation is the dreadful dilemma to which it is continually expo&s;ed.</P>

<HEAD>NUMBER XXXIX. The Conformity of the Plan to Republican Principles: An Objection in Re&s;pect to the Powers of the Convention, examined.</HEAD>
<P>THE la&s;t paper having concluded the ob&s;ervations which were meant to introduce a candid &s;urvey of the plan of government reported by the convention, we now proceed to the execution of that part of our undertaking. The fir&s;t que&s;tion that offers it&s;elf is, whether the general form and a&s;pect of the govern|ment be &s;trictly republican? It is evident that no other form would be reconcileable with the genius of the people of America; with the fundamental princi|ples of the revolution; or with that honorable deter|mination, which animates every votary of freedom, to re&s;t all our political experiments on the capacity of mankind for &s;elf-government. If the plan of the convention therefore be found to depart from the republican character, its advocates mu&s;t abandon it as no longer defen&s;ible.</P>
<P>What then are the di&s;tinctive characters of the republican form? Were an an&s;wer to this que&s;tion to be &s;ought, not by recurring to principles, but in the application of the term by political writers, to the con&s;titutions of different &s;tates, no &s;atisfactory one would ever be found. Holland, in which no particle of the &s;upreme authority is derived from the people, has pa&s;&s;ed almo&s;t univer&s;ally under the denomination of a republic. The &s;ame title has been be&s;towed on Venice, where ab&s;olute power over the great body of the people, is exerci&s;ed in the mo&s;t ab&s;olute manner, by a &s;mall body of hereditary nobles. Poland which is a mixture of ari&s;tocracy and of monarchy in their wor&s;t forms, has been dignified with the &s;ame appellation. The government of England, which has one republican
<PB N="21" REF="021127_0258_0FB23E28839F9108">
branch only, combined with a hereditary ari&s;tocracy and monarchy, has with equal impropriety been frequently placed on the li&s;t of republics. The&s;e examples, which are nearly as di&s;&s;imilar to each other as to a genuine republic, &s;hew the extreme inaccuracy with which the term has been u&s;ed in political di&s;qui|&s;itions.</P>
<P>If we re&s;ort for a criterion, to the different principles on which different forms of government are e&s;tabli&s;hed, we may define a republic to be, or at lea&s;t may be&s;tow that name on, a government which derives all its powers directly or indirectly from the great body of the people; and is admini&s;tered by per&s;ons holding their offices during plea&s;ure, for a limited period, or during good behaviour. It is <HI>e&s;&s;ential</HI> to &s;uch a govern|ment, that it be derived from the great body of the &s;ociety, not from an incon&s;iderable proportion, or a favored cla&s;s of it; otherwi&s;e a handful of tyrannical nobles, exerci&s;ing their oppre&s;&s;ions by a delegation of their powers, might a&s;pire to the rank of republicans, and claim for their government the honorable title of republic. It is <HI>&s;ufficient</HI> for &s;uch a government, that the per&s;ons admini&s;tering it be appointed, either directly or indirectly, by the people; and that they hold their appointments by either of the tenures ju&s;t &s;pecified; otherwi&s;e every government in the United States, as well as every other popular government that has been or can be well organi&s;ed or well executed, would be degraded from the republican character. According to the con&s;titution of every &s;tate in the union, &s;ome or other of the officers of government are appointed indirectly only by the people. According to mo&s;t of them the chief magi&s;trate him&s;elf is &s;o appointed. And according to one, this mode of ap|pointment is extended to one of the co-ordinate branches of the legi&s;lature. According to all the con&s;titutions al&s;o, the tenure of the highe&s;t offices is extended to a definite period, and in many in&s;tances, both within the legi&s;lative and executive departments, to a period
<PB N="22" REF="021127_0259_0FB23E2A04454300">
of years. According to the provi&s;ions of mo&s;t of the con&s;titutions, again, as well as according to the mo&s;t re&s;pectable and received opinions on the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ubject, the members of the judiciary department are to retain their offices by the firm tenure of good behaviour.</P>
<P>On comparing the con&s;titution planned by the con|vention, with the &s;tandard here fixed, we perceive at once that it is in the mo&s;t rigid &s;en&s;e conformable to it. The hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives, like that of one branch at lea&s;t of all the &s;tate legi&s;latures, is elected immediately by the great body of the people. The &s;enate, like the pre&s;ent congre&s;s, and the &s;enate of maryland&punc; derives its appointment indirectly from the people. The pre&s;ident is indirectly derived from the choice of the people, according to the example in mo&s;t of the &s;tates. Even the judges, with all other officers of the union, will, as in the &s;everal &s;tates, be the choice, though a remote choice, of the people them|&s;elves. The duration of the appointments is equally conformable to the republican &s;tandard, and to the model of the &s;tate con&s;titutions. The hou&s;e of repre|&s;entatives is periodically elective as in all the &s;tates; and for the period of two years as in the &s;tate of &s;outh carolina. The &s;enate is elective for the period of &s;ix years; which is but one year more than the period of the &s;enate of Maryland; and but two more than that of the &s;enates of New-York and Virginia. The pre&s;ident is to continue in office for the period of four years; as in New-York and Delaware, the chief magi&s;trate is elected for three years, and in South Carolina for two years. In the other &s;tates the election is annual. In &s;everal of the &s;tates however, no explicit provi|&s;ion is made for the impeachment of the chief magi&s;|trate. And in Delaware and Virginia, he is not impeachable till out of office. The pre&s;ident of the United States is impeachable at any time during his continuance in office. The tenure by which the judges are to hold their places, is, as it unque&s;tionably ought to be, that of good behaviour. The tenure of the
<PB N="23" REF="021127_0260_0FB23E2B838882B0" MS="y">
mini&s;terial offices generally will be a &s;ubject of legal regulation, conformably to the rea&s;on of the ca&s;e, and the example of the &s;tate con&s;titutions.</P>
<P>Could any further proof be required of the republi|can complexion of this &s;y&s;tem, the mo&s;t deci&s;ive one might be found in its ab&s;olute prohibition of titles of nobility, both under the federal and the &s;tate govern|ments; and in its expre&s;s guaratee of the republican form to each of the latter.</P>
<P>But it was not &s;ufficient, &s;ay the adver&s;aries of the propo&s;ed con&s;titution, for the convention to adhere to the republican form. They ought with equal care, to have pre&s;erved the <HI>federal</HI> form, which regards the union as a <HI>confederacy</HI> of &s;overeign &s;tates; in&s;tead of which, they have framed a <HI>national</HI> government, which regards the union as a <HI>con&s;olidation</HI> of the &s;tates. And it is a&s;ked by what authority this bold and radical in|novation was undertaken. The handle which has been made of this objection requires, that it &s;hould be examined with &s;ome preci&s;ion.</P>
<P>Without enquiring into the accuracy of the di&s;tinc|tion on which the objection is founded, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to a ju&s;t e&s;timate of its force, fir&s;t to a&s;certain the real character of the government in que&s;tion; &s;econdly, to enquire how far the convention were authori&s;ed to propo&s;e &s;uch a government; and thirdly, how far the duty they owed to their country, could &s;upply any defect of regular authority.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t. In order to a&s;certain the real character of the government it may be con&s;idered in relation to the foundation on which it is to be e&s;tabli&s;hed; to the &s;ources from which its ordinary powers are to be drawn to the operation of tho&s;e powers; to the extent of them; and to the authority by which future changes in the government are to be introduced.</P>
<P>On examining the fir&s;t relation, it appears on one hand that the con&s;titution is to be founded on the a&s;&s;ent and ratification of the people of America, given by deputies elected for the &s;pecial purpo&s;e; but on the
<PB N="24" REF="021127_0261_0FB23E2D631E3C00">
other that this a&s;&s;ent and ratification is to be given by the people, not as individuals compo&s;ing one entire nation; but as compo&s;ing the di&s;tinct and independent &s;tates to which they re&s;pectively belong. It is to be the a&s;&s;ent and ratification of the &s;everal &s;tates derived from the &s;upreme authority in each &s;tate, the authority of the people them&s;elves. The act therefore e&s;ta|bli&s;hing the con&s;titution, will not be a <HI>national</HI> but a <HI>federal</HI> act.</P>
<P>That it will be a federal and not a national act, as the&s;e terms are under&s;tood by the objectors, the act of the people as forming &s;o many independent &s;tates, not as forming one aggregate nation is obvious from this &s;ingle con&s;ideration, that it is to re&s;ult neither from the deci&s;ion of a <HI>majority</HI> of the people of the union, nor from that of a <HI>majority</HI> of the &s;tates. It mu&s;t re&s;ult from the <HI>unanimous</HI> a&s;&s;ent of the &s;everal &s;tates that are parties to it, differing no other wi&s;e from their ordinary a&s;&s;ent than in its being expre&s;&s;ed, not by the legi&s;lative authority, but by that of the people them&s;elves. Were the people regarded in this tran&s;action as forming one nation, the will of the majority of the whole people of the United States, would bind the minority; in the &s;ame manner as the majority in each &s;tate mu&s;t bind the minority; and the will of the majority mu&s;t be determined either by a compari&s;on of the individual votes; or by con&s;ider|ing the will of the majority of the &s;tates, as evidence of the will of a majority of the people of the United States. Neither of the&s;e rules has been adopted. Each &s;tate in ratifying the con&s;titution, is con&s;idered as a &s;overeign body independent of all others, and only to be bound by its own voluntary act. In this relation then the new con&s;titution will, if e&s;tabli&s;hed, be a <HI>federal</HI> and not a <HI>national</HI> con&s;titution.</P>
<P>The next relation is to the &s;ources from which the ordinary powers of government are to be derived. The hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives will derive its powers
<PB N="25" REF="021127_0262_0FB23E2E851A0F90">
from the people of America, and the people will be repre&s;ented in the &s;ame proportion, and on the &s;ame principle, as they are in the legi&s;lature of a parti|cular &s;tate. So far the government is <HI>national</HI> not <HI>federal.</HI> The &s;enate on the other hand will derive its powers from the &s;tates, as political and co-equal &s;oci|eties; and the&s;e will be repre&s;ented on the principle of equality in the &s;enate, as they now are in the exi&s;t|ing congre&s;s. So far the government is <HI>federal,</HI> not <HI>national.</HI> The executive power will be derived from a very compound &s;ource. The immediate election of the pre&s;ident is to be made by the &s;tates in their po|litical characters. The votes allotted to them, are in a compound ratio, which con&s;iders them partly as di&s;tinct and co-equal &s;ocieties; partly as unequal members of the &s;ame &s;ociety. The eventual election, again is to be made by that branch of the legi&s;lature which con&s;i&s;ts of the national repre&s;entatives; but in this particular act, they are to be thrown into the form of individual delegations from &s;o many di&s;tinct and co-equal bodies politic. From this a&s;pect of the government, it appears to be of a mixed cha|racter, pre&s;enting at lea&s;t as many <HI>federal</HI> as <HI>national</HI> features.</P>
<P>The difference between a federal and national go|vernment, as it relates to the <HI>operation of the govern|ment,</HI> is, by the adver&s;aries of the plan of the conven|tion, &s;uppo&s;ed to con&s;i&s;t in this, that in the former, the powers operate on the political bodies compo&s;ing the confederacy, in their political capacities; in the latter, on the individual citizens compo&s;ing the nation, in their individual capacities. On trying the con&s;titution by this criterion, it falls under the <HI>national,</HI> not the <HI>federal</HI> character; though perhaps not &s;o compleatly as has been under&s;tood. In &s;everal ca&s;es, and particularly in the trial of controver&s;ies to which &s;tates may be parties, they mu&s;t be viewed and proceeded again&s;t in their collective and political capacities only.

on the people in their individual capacities, in its ordinary and mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential proceedings, will on the whole, in the &s;en&s;e of its opponents, de&s;ignate it in this relation, a <HI>national</HI> government.</P>
<P>But if the government be national with regard to the <HI>operation</HI> of its powers, it changes its a&s;pect again when we contemplate it in relation to the <HI>extent</HI> of its powers. The idea of a national government in|volves in it, not only an authority over the individual citizens, but an indefinite &s;upremacy over all per&s;ons and things, &s;o far as they are objects of lawful go|vernment. Among a people con&s;olidated into one nation, this &s;upremacy is compleatly ve&s;ted in the national legi&s;lature. Among communities united for particular purpo&s;es, it is ve&s;ted partly in the gene|ral, and partly in the municipal legi&s;latures. In the former ca&s;e, all local authorities are &s;ubordinate to the &s;upreme; and may be controuled, directed, or aboli&s;hed by it at plea&s;ure. In the latter, the local or municipal authorities form di&s;tinct and inde|pendent portions of the &s;upremacy, no more &s;ubject within their re&s;pective &s;pheres to the general autho|rity, than the general authority is &s;ubject to them within its own &s;phere. In this relation then, the propo&s;ed government cannot be deemed a <HI>national</HI> one; &s;ince its juri&s;diction extends to certain enume|rated objects only, and leaves to the &s;everal &s;tates a re&s;iduary and inviolable &s;overeignty over all other objects. It is true that in controver&s;ies relating to the boundary between the two juri&s;dictions, the tri|bunal which is ultimately to decide, is to be e&s;tab|li&s;hed under the general government. But this does not change the principle of the ca&s;e. The deci&s;ion is to be impartially made, according to the rules of the con&s;titution; and all the u&s;ual and mo&s;t effectual precautions are taken to &s;ecure this impartiality. Some &s;uch tribunal is clearly e&s;&s;ential to prevent an appeal to the &s;word, and a di&s;&s;olution of the com|pact; and that it ought to be e&s;tabli&s;hed under the
<PB N="27" REF="021127_0264_0FB23E31845B9DA8">
general, rather than under the local governments; or to &s;peak more properly, that it could be &s;afely e&s;tabli&s;hed under the fir&s;t alone, is a po&s;ition not likely to be combated.</P>
<P>If we try the con&s;titution by its la&s;t relation, to the authority by which amendments are to be made, we find it neither wholly <HI>national,</HI> nor wholly <HI>federal.</HI> Were it wholly national, the &s;upreme and ultimate authority would re&s;ide in the <HI>majority</HI> of the people of the union; and this authority would be compe|tent at all times, like that of a majority of every na|tional &s;ociety, to alter or aboli&s;h its e&s;tabli&s;hed go|vernment. Were it wholly federal on the other hand, the concurrence of each &s;tate in the union would be e&s;&s;ential to every alteration that would be binding on all. The mode provided by the plan of the convention, is not founded on either of the&s;e principles. In requir|ing more than a majority, and particularly, in comput|ing the proportion by <HI>&s;tates,</HI> not by <HI>citizens,</HI> it departs from the <HI>national,</HI> and advances towards the <HI>federal</HI> character: In rendering the concurrence of le&s;s than the whole number of &s;tates &s;ufficient, it lo&s;es again the <HI>federal,</HI> and partakes of the <HI>national</HI> character.</P>
<P>The propo&s;ed con&s;titution therefore, even when te&s;ted by the rules laid down by its antagoni&s;ts, is in &s;trictne&s;s, neither a national nor a federal con&s;titution; but a compo&s;ition of both. In its foundation it is federal, not national; in the &s;ources from which the ordinary powers of the government are drawn, it is partly federal, and partly national; in the operation of the&s;e powers, it is national, not federal; in the extent of them again, it is federal, not national; and finally, in the authoritative mode of introducing amendments, it is neither wholly federal, nor wholly national.</P>

<HEAD>NUMBER XL. The &s;ame Objection further examined.</HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>&s;econd</HI> point to be examined is, whether the convention were authori&s;ed to frame and pro|po&s;e this mixed con&s;titution.</P>
<P>The powers of the convention ought in &s;trictne&s;s to be determined by an in&s;pection of the commi&s;&s;ions given to the members by their re&s;pective con&s;tituents. As all of the&s;e however, had reference, either to the recommendation from the meeting at Annapolis in September, 1786, or to that from congre&s;s in Fe|bruary, 1787, it will be &s;ufficient to recur to the&s;e particular acts.</P>
<P>The act from Annapolis recommends the
<Q>ap|pointment of commi&s;&s;ioners to take into con&s;ider|ation the &s;ituation of the United States, to devi&s;e <HI>&s;uch further provi&s;ions</HI> as &s;hall appear to them ne|ce&s;&s;ary to render the con&s;titution of the federal go|vernment <HI>adequate to the exigencies of the union</HI>; and to report &s;uch an act for that purpo&s;e, to the United States in congre&s;s a&s;&s;embled, as, when agreed to by them, and afterwards confirmed by the legi&s;lature of every &s;tate, will effectually pro|vide for the &s;ame.</Q></P>
<P>The recommendatory act of congre&s;s is in the words following:
<Q>Whereas there is provi&s;ion in the articles of confederation and perpetual union, for making alterations therein, by the a&s;&s;ent of a congre&s;s of the United States, and of the legi&s;la|tures of the &s;everal &s;tates: And whereas experi|ence hath evinced, that there are defects in the pre&s;ent confederation, as a mean to remedy which &s;everal of the &s;tates, and <HI>particularly the &s;tate of New-York,</HI> by expre&s;s in&s;tructions to their dele|gates in congre&s;s, have &s;ugge&s;ted a convention for
<PB N="29" REF="021127_0266_0FB23E3482DD3EF0">
the purpo&s;es expre&s;&s;ed in the following re&s;olution; and &s;uch convention appearing to be the mo&s;t pro|bable mean of e&s;tabli&s;hing in the&s;e &s;tates, <HI>a firm national government.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>Re&s;olved, That in the opinion of congre&s;s, it is expedient, that on the 2d Monday in May next, a convention of delegates, who &s;hall have been appointed by the &s;everal &s;tates, be held at Phila|delphia, for the &s;ole and expre&s;s purpo&s;e <HI>of revi&s;|ing the articles of confederation,</HI> and reporting to congre&s;s and the &s;everal legi&s;latures, &s;uch <HI>alter|nations and provi&s;ions therein,</HI> as &s;hall, when agreed to in congre&s;s, and confirmed by the &s;tates, ren|der the federal con&s;titution <HI>adequate to the exigencies of government and the pre&s;ervation of the union.</HI></Q></P>
<P>From the&s;e two acts it appears, 1&s;t. that the ob|ject of the convention was to e&s;tabli&s;h in the&s;e &s;tates, <HI>a firm national government</HI>; 2d. that this government was to be &s;uch as would be <HI>adequate to the exigencies of government</HI> and <HI>the pre&s;ervation of the union</HI>; 3d. that the&s;e purpo&s;es were to be effected by <HI>alterations and provi&s;ions in the articles of confederation,</HI> as it is expre&s;&s;ed in the act of congre&s;s, or by <HI>&s;uch further provi&s;ions as &s;hould appear nece&s;&s;ary,</HI> as it &s;tands in the recommendatory act from Annapolis; 4th. that the alterations and provi&s;ions were to be reported to congre&s;s, and to the &s;tates, in order to be agreed to by the former, and confirmed by the latter.</P>
<P>From a compari&s;on and fair con&s;truction of the&s;e &s;everal modes of expre&s;&s;ion, is to be deduced the authority under which the convention acted. They were to frame a <HI>national government,</HI> adequate to the <HI>exigencies of government</HI> and <HI>of the union,</HI> and to re|duce the articles of confederation into &s;uch form as to accompli&s;h the&s;e purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>There are two rules of con&s;truction dictated by plain rea&s;on, as well as founded on legal axioms. The one is, that every part of the expre&s;&s;ion ought, if po&s;|&s;ible, to be allowed &s;ome meaning, and be made to
<PB N="30" REF="021127_0267_0FB23E36033D0678">
con&s;pire to &s;ome common end. The other is, that where the &s;everal parts cannot be made to coincide, the le&s;s important &s;hould give way to the more im|portant part; the means &s;hould be &s;acrificed to the end, rather than the end to the means.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e then that the expre&s;&s;ions defining the authority of the convention, were irreconcileably at variance with each other; that a <HI>national</HI> and <HI>ade|quate government</HI> could not po&s;&s;ibly, in the judgment of the convention, be effected by <HI>alterations</HI> and <HI>pro|vi&s;ions</HI> in the <HI>articles of confederation,</HI> which part of the definition ought to have been embraced, and which rejected? Which was the more important, which the le&s;s important part? Which the end, which the means? Let the mo&s;t &s;crupulous expo&s;itors of delegated powers; let the mo&s;t inveterate ob|jectors again&s;t tho&s;e exerci&s;ed by the convention, an&s;wer the&s;e que&s;tions. Let them declare, whether it was of mo&s;t importance to the happine&s;s of the people of America, that the articles of confederation &s;hould be di&s;regarded, and an adequate government be provided, and the union pre&s;erved; or that an adequate government &s;hould be omitted, and the ar|ticles of confederation pre&s;erved. Let them declare, whether the pre&s;ervation of the&s;e articles was the end for &s;ecuring which a reform of the government was to be introduced as the means; or whether the e&s;tabli&s;h|ment of a government, adequate to the national hap|pine&s;s, was the end at which the&s;e articles them&s;elves originally aimed, and to which they ought, as in&s;uffi|cient means, to have been &s;acrificed.</P>
<P>But is it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;uppo&s;e that the&s;e expre&s;&s;ions are ab&s;olutely irreconciliable to each other; that no <HI>alterations</HI> or <HI>provi&s;ions</HI> in the <HI>articles of the confe|deration,</HI> could po&s;&s;ibly mould them into a national and adequate government; into &s;uch a governmen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> as has been propo&s;ed by the convention?</P>
<P>No &s;tre&s;s it is pre&s;umed will in this ca&s;e be laid o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the <HI>title,</HI> a change of that could never be deemed a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">

exerci&s;e of ungranted power. <HI>Alterations</HI> in the body of the in&s;trument, are expre&s;sly authori&s;ed. <HI>New provi&s;ions</HI> therein are al&s;o expre&s;sly authori&s;ed. Here then is a power to change the title; to in&s;ert new articles; to alter old ones, Mu&s;t it of nece&s;&s;ity be admitted that this power is infringed, &s;o long as a part of the old articles remain? Tho&s;e who maintain the affirmative, ought at lea&s;t to mark the boundary between authori&s;ed and u&s;urped innovations, between that degree of change which lies within the compa&s;s of <HI>alterations and further provi&s;ions</HI>; and that which amounts to a <HI>tran&s;mutation</HI> of the government. Will it be &s;aid that the alterations ought not to have touched the &s;ub&s;tance of the confederation? The &s;tates would never have appointed a convention with &s;o much &s;olemnity, nor de&s;cribed its objects with &s;o much lati|tude, if &s;ome <HI>&s;ub&s;tantial</HI> reform had not been in con|templation. Will it be &s;aid that the <HI>fundamental principles</HI> of the confederation were not within the purview of the convention, and ought not to have been varied? I a&s;k what are the&s;e principles? Do they require that in the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the con&s;titu|tion, the &s;tates &s;hould be regarded as di&s;tinct and in|dependent &s;overeigns? They are &s;o regarded by the con&s;titution propo&s;ed. Do they require that the members of the government &s;hould derive their ap|pointment from the legi&s;latures, not from the people of the &s;tates? One branch of the new government is to be appointed by the&s;e legi&s;latures; and under the confederation the delegates to congre&s;s <HI>may all</HI> be appointed immediately by the people, and in two &s;tates<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Connecticut and Rhode-I&s;land.</NOTE> are actually &s;o appointed. Do they require that the powers of the government &s;hould act on the &s;tates, and not immediately on individuals? In &s;ome in&s;tances, as has been &s;hewn, the powers of the new government will act on the &s;tates in their collective characters. In &s;ome in&s;tances al&s;o tho&s;e of the exi&s;t|ing government act immediately on individuals: In
<PB N="32" REF="021127_0269_0FB23E3902EFFBD0">
ca&s;es of capture, of piracy, of the po&s;t-office, of coins weights and mea&s;ures, of trade with the Indians, of claims under grants of land by different &s;tates, and above all, in the ca&s;e of trials by courts-martial in the army and navy, by which death may be inflicted without the intervention of a jury, or even of a civil magi&s;trate; in all the&s;e ca&s;es the powers of the con|federation operate immediately on the per&s;ons and intere&s;ts of individual citizens. Do the&s;e fundamen|tal principles require particularly that no tax &s;hould be levied without the intermediate agency of the &s;tates? The confederation it&s;elf authori&s;es a direct tax to a certain extent on the po&s;t-office. The power of coinage has been &s;o con&s;trued by congre&s;s, as to levy a tribute immediately from that &s;ource al&s;o. But pretermitting the&s;e in&s;tances, was it not an acknow|ledged object of the convention, and the univer&s;al expectation of the people, that the regulation of trade &s;hould be &s;ubmitted to the general government in &s;uch a form as would render it an immediate &s;ource of ge|neral revenue? Had not congre&s;s repeatedly recom|mended this mea&s;ure as not incon&s;i&s;tent with the fundamental principles of the confederation? Had not every &s;tate but one, had not New-York her&s;elf, &s;o far complied with the plan of congre&s;s, as to recog|nize the <HI>principle</HI> of the innovation? Do the&s;e prin|ciples in fine require that the powers of the general government &s;hould be limited, and that beyond this limit, the &s;tates &s;hould be left in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their &s;overeignty and independence? We have &s;een that in the new government as in the old, the general powers are limited, and that the &s;tates, in all un|enumerated ca&s;es, are left in the enjoyment of their &s;overeign and independent juri&s;diction.</P>
<P>The truth is, that the great principles of the con|&s;titution propo&s;ed by the convention, may be con&s;i|dered le&s;s as ab&s;olutely new, than as the expan&s;ion of principles which are found in the articles of confe|deration. The misfortune under the latter &s;y&s;tem
<PB N="33" REF="021127_0270_0FB23E3A834F4658">
has been, that the&s;e principles are &s;o feeble and con|fined as to ju&s;tify all the charges of inefficiency which have been urged again&s;t it; and to require a degree of enlargement which gives to the new &s;y&s;tem, the a&s;pect of an entire transformation of the old.</P>
<P>In one particular it is admitted that the convention have departed from the tenor of their commi&s;&s;ion. In&s;tead of reporting a plan requiring the confirmation <HI>of all the &s;tates,</HI> they have reported a plan which is to be confirmed and may be carried into effect by <HI>nine &s;tates only.</HI> It is worthy of remark, that this objection, though the mo&s;t plau&s;ible, has been the lea&s;t urged in the publications which have &s;warmed again&s;t the convention. The forbearance can only have proceeded from an irre&s;i&s;tible conviction of the ab&s;ur|dity of &s;ubjecting the &s;ate of twelve &s;tates, to the perver&s;ene&s;s or corruption of a thirteenth; from the example of inflexible oppo&s;ition given by a <HI>majority</HI> of one &s;ixtieth of the people of America, to a mea&s;ure approved and called for by the voice of twelve &s;tates compri&s;ing fifty-nine &s;ixtieths of the people; an example &s;till fre&s;h in the memory and indignation of every citizen who has felt for the wounded honor and pro&s;perity of his country. As this objection therefore, has been in a manner waved by tho&s;e who have cri|tici&s;ed the powers of the convention, I di&s;mi&s;s it without further ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>The <HI>third</HI> point to be enquired into is, how far con|&s;iderations of duty ari&s;ing out of the ca&s;e it&s;elf, could have &s;upplied any defect of regular authority.</P>
<P>In the preceding enquiries, the powers of the con|vention have been anali&s;ed and tried with the &s;ame rigour, and by the &s;ame rules, as if they had been real and final powers, for the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a con|&s;titution for the United States. We have &s;een, in what manner they have borne the trial, even on that &s;uppo&s;ition. It is time now to recollect, that the powers were merely advi&s;ory and recommendatory; that they were &s;o meant by the &s;tates, and &s;o under|&s;tood
<PB N="34" REF="021127_0271_0FB23E3C03ADECD0">
by the convention; and that the latter have accordingly planned and propo&s;ed a con&s;titution, which is to be of no more con&s;equence than the paper on which it is written, unle&s;s it be &s;tamped with the approbation of tho&s;e to whom it is addre&s;&s;ed. This reflection places the &s;ubject in a point of view altogether different, and will enable us to judge with propriety of the cour&s;e taken by the convention.</P>
<P>Let us view the ground on which the convention &s;tood. It may be collected from their proceedings, that they were deeply and unanimou&s;ly impre&s;&s;ed with the cri&s;is which had led their country almo&s;t with one voice to m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ke &s;o &s;ingular and &s;olemn an experiment, for correcting the errors of a &s;y&s;tem by which this cri&s;is had been produced; that they were no le&s;s deeply and unanimou&s;ly convinced, that &s;uch a reform as they have propo&s;ed, was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to effect the purpo&s;es of their appointment. It could not be unknown to them, that the hopes and ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ec|tations of the great body of citizens, throughout this great empire, were turned with the keene&s;t anxiety, to the event of their deliberations. They had every rea&s;on to believe that the contrary &s;entiments agi|tated the minds and bo&s;oms of every external and internal foe to the liberty and pro&s;perity of the United States. They had &s;een in the origin and progre&s;s of the experiment, the alacrity with which the <HI>propo&s;ition,</HI> made by a &s;ingle &s;tate (Virginia) towards a partial amendment of the confederation, had been attended to and promoted. They had &s;een the <HI>liberty a&s;&s;umed</HI> by a <HI>very few</HI> deputies, from a <HI>very few</HI> &s;tates, convened at Annapolis, of recom|mending a great and critical object, wholly foreign to their commi&s;&s;ion, not only ju&s;tified by the public opinion, but actually carried into effect, by twelve out of the Thirteen States. They had &s;een in a variety of in&s;tances, a&s;&s;umptions by congre&s;s not only of recommendatory, but of operative powers, warranted
<PB N="35" REF="021127_0272_0FB23E3D8302FF00">
in the public e&s;timation, by occa&s;ions and objects infi|nitely le&s;s urgent than tho&s;e by which their conduct was to be governed. They mu&s;t have reflected, that in all great changes of e&s;tabli&s;hed governments, forms ought to give way to &s;ub&s;tance; that a rigid adherence in &s;uch ca&s;es to the former, would render nominal and nugatory, the tran&s;cendent and precious right of the people to
<Q>aboli&s;h or alter their governments as to them &s;hall &s;eem mo&s;t likely to effect their &s;afety and happine&s;s<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Declaration of Independence.</NOTE>;</Q>
&s;ince it is impo&s;&s;ible for the people &s;pontaneou&s;ly and univer&s;ally, to move in concert towards their object; and it is therefore e&s;&s;ential, that &s;uch changes be in&s;tituted by &s;ome <HI>informal and unauthori&s;ed pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">po&s;itions,</HI> made by &s;ome patriotic and re&s;pectable citizen or number of citi|zens. They mu&s;t have recollected that it was by this irregular and a&s;&s;umed privilege of propo&s;ing to the people plans for their &s;afety and happine&s;s, that the &s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tes were fir&s;t united again&s;t the danger with which they were threatened by their antient government; that committees and congre&s;&s;es were formed for con|centrating their efforts, and defending their rights; and that <HI>conventions</HI> were <HI>elected</HI> in <HI>the &s;everal &s;tates,</HI> for e&s;tabli&s;hing the con&s;titutions under which they are now governed; nor could it have been forgotten that no little ill-timed &s;cruples, no zeal for adhering to ordinary forms were any where &s;een, except in tho&s;e who wi&s;hed to indulge under the&s;e ma&s;ks, their &s;e|cret enmity to the &s;ub&s;tance contended for. They mu&s;t have borne in mind, that as the plan to be framed and propo&s;ed, was to be &s;ubmitted to <HI>the people them&s;elves,</HI> the di&s;approbation of this &s;upreme authority would de&s;troy it for ever; its approbation blot out all antecedent errors and irregularities. It might even have occurred to them, that where a di&s;|po&s;ition to cavil prevailed, their neglect to execute the degree of power ve&s;ted in them, and &s;till more their recommendation of any mea&s;ure whatever not

warranted by their commi&s;&s;ion, would not le&s;s excite animadver&s;ion, than a recommendation at once of a mea&s;ure fully commen&s;urate to the na|tional exigenc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">es.</P>
<P>Had the convention under all the&s;e impre&s;&s;ions, and in the mid&s;t of all the&s;e con&s;iderations, in&s;tead of exerci&s;ing a manly confidence in their country, by who&s;e confidence they had been &s;o peculiarly di&s;tin|gui&s;hed, and of pointing out a &s;y&s;tem capable in their judgment of &s;ecuring its happine&s;s, taken the cold and &s;ullen re&s;olution of di&s;appointing its ardent hopes of &s;acrificing &s;ub&s;tance to forms, of committing the deare&s;t intere&s;ts of their country to the uncertainties of delay, and the hazard of events; let me a&s;k the man, who can rai&s;e his mind to one elevated con|ception; who can awaken in his bo&s;om, one patri|otic emotion, what judgment ought to have been pro|nounced by the impartial world, by the friends of mankind, by every virtuous citizen, on the conduct and character of this a&s;&s;embly, or if there be a man who&s;e propen&s;ity to condemn, is &s;u&s;ceptible of no controul, let me then a&s;k what &s;entence he has in re|&s;erve for the twelve &s;tates who <HI>u&s;urped the power of</HI> &s;ending deputies to the convention, a body utterly unknown to their con&s;titutions; for congre&s;s, who recommended the appointment of this body, equally unknown to the confederation; and for the &s;tate of New-York in particular, who fir&s;t urged, and then complied with this unauthori&s;ed interpo&s;ition.</P>
<P>But that the objectors may be di&s;armed of every pretext, it &s;hall be granted for a moment, that the convention were neither authori&s;ed by their commi&s;|&s;ion, nor ju&s;tified by circum&s;tances, in propo&s;ing a con&s;titution for their country: Does it follow that the con&s;titution ought for that rea&s;on alone to be re|jected? If according to the noble precept, it be law|ful to accept good advice even from an enemy, &s;hall we &s;et the ignoble example of refu&s;ing &s;uch advice even when it is offered by our friends?

<P>The &s;um of what has been here advanced and proved, is that the charge again&s;t the convention of exceeding their powers, except in one in&s;tance little urged by the objectors, has no foundation to &s;upport it; that if they had exceeded their powers, they were not only warranted but required, as the confidential &s;ervants of their country, by the circum&s;tances in which they were placed, to exerci&s;e the liberty which they a&s;&s;umed, and that finally, if they had violated both their powers, and their obligations in propo&s;ing a con&s;titution, this ought neverthele&s;s to be embra|ced, if it be calculated to accompli&s;h the views and happine&s;s of the people of America.

<HEAD>NUMBER XLI. General View of the Powers propo&s;ed to be ve&s;ted in the Union.</HEAD>
<P>THE con&s;titution propo&s;ed by the convention may be con&s;idered under two general points of view. The FIRST relates to the &s;um or quantity of power which it ve&s;ts in the government, including the re&s;traints impo&s;ed on the &s;tates. The SECOND, to the particular &s;tructure of the government, and the di&s;tribution of this power, among its &s;everal branches.</P>
<P>Under the fir&s;t view of the &s;ubject two important que&s;tions ari&s;e; 1. Whether any part of the powers transferred to the general government be unnece&s;&s;ary or improper? 2. Whether the entire ma&s;s of them be dangerous to the portion of juri&s;diction left in the &s;everal &s;tates?</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="021127_0275_0FB23E4206168478">Is the aggregate power of the general government greater than ought to have been ve&s;ted in it? This is the fir&s;t que&s;tion.</P>
<P>It cannot have e&s;caped tho&s;e who have attended with candour to the arguments employed again&s;t the exten&s;ive powers of the government, that the authors of them have very little con&s;idered how far the&s;e powers were nece&s;&s;ary means of attaining a nece&s;&s;ary end. They have cho&s;en rather to dwell on the incon|veniences which mu&s;t be unavoidably blended with all political advantages; and on the po&s;&s;ible abu&s;es which mu&s;t be incident to every power or tru&s;t of which a beneficial u&s;e can be made. This method of handling the &s;ubject cannot impo&s;e on the good &s;en&s;e of the people of America. It may di&s;play the &s;ubtlety of the writer; it may open a boundle&s;s field for rhetoric and declamation; it may inflame the pa&s;&s;ions of the unthinking, and may confirm the pre|judices of the mi&s;thinking. But cool and candid people will at once reflect, that the pure&s;t of human ble&s;&s;ings mu&s;t have a portion of alloy in them; that the choice mu&s;t always be made, if not of the le&s;&s;er evil, at lea&s;t of the GREATER, not the PERFECT good; and that in every political in&s;titution, a power to advance the public happine&s;s involves a di&s;cretion which may be mi&s;applied and abu&s;ed. They will &s;ee therefore that in all ca&s;es, where power is to be conferred, the point fir&s;t to be decided is whether &s;uch a power be nece&s;&s;ary to the public good; as the next will be, in ca&s;e of an affirmative deci&s;ion, to guard as effectually as po&s;&s;ible again&s;t a perver&s;ion of the power to the public detriment.</P>
<P>That we may form a correct judgment on this &s;ub|ject, it will be proper to review the &s;everal powers conferred on the government of the union; and that this may be the more conveniently done, they may be reduced into different cla&s;&s;es as they relate to the following different objects; 1. Security again&s;t fo|reign danger; 2. Regulation of the intercour&s;e with
<PB N="39" REF="021127_0276_0FB23E43840BDF98">
foreign nations; 3. Maintenance of harmony and proper intercour&s;e among the &s;tates; 4. Certain mi&s;|cellaneous objects of general utility; 5. Re&s;traint of the &s;tates from certain injurious acts; 6. Provi&s;ions for giving due efficacy to all the&s;e powers.</P>
<P>The powers falling within the fir&s;t cla&s;s, are tho&s;e of declaring war, and granting letters of marque; of providing armies and fleets; of regulating and calling forth the militia; of levying and borrowing money.</P>
<P>Security again&s;t foreign danger is one of the pri|mitive objects of civil &s;ociety. It is an avowed and e&s;&s;ential object of the American union. The powers requi&s;ite for attaining it, mu&s;t be effectually confided to the federal councils.</P>
<P>Is the power of declaring war nece&s;&s;ary? No man will an&s;wer this que&s;tion in the negative. It would be &s;uperfluous therefore to enter into a proof of the affirmative. The exi&s;ting confederation e&s;tabli&s;hes this power in the mo&s;t ample form.</P>
<P>Is the power of rai&s;ing armies, and equipping fleets nece&s;&s;ary? This is involved in the foregoing power. It is involved in the power of &s;elf-defence.</P>
<P>But was it nece&s;&s;ary to give an INDEFINITE POWER of rai&s;ing TROOPS, as well as providing fleets; and of maintaining both in PEACE, as well as in WAR?</P>
<P>The an&s;wer to the&s;e que&s;tions has been too far anticipated, in another place, to admit an exten&s;ive di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of them in this place. The an&s;wer in|deed &s;eems to be &s;o obvious and conclu&s;ive as &s;carcely to ju&s;tify &s;uch a di&s;cu&s;&s;ion in any place. With what colour of propriety could the force nece&s;&s;ary for de|fence, be limited by tho&s;e who cannot limit the force of offence? If a federal con&s;titution could chain the ambition, or &s;et bounds to the exertions of all other nations, then indeed might it prudently chain the di&s;cretion of its own government, and &s;et bounds to the exertions for its own &s;afety.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="021127_0277_0FB23E4504D8F780">How could a readine&s;s for war in time of peace be &s;afely prohibited, unle&s;s we could prohibit in like manner the preparations and e&s;tabli&s;hments of every ho&s;tile nation? The means of &s;ecurity can only be regulated by the means and the danger of attack. They will in fact be ever determined by the&s;e rules, and by no others. It is in vain to oppo&s;e con&s;tituti|onal barriers to the impul&s;e of &s;elf-pre&s;ervation. It is wor&s;e than in vain; becau&s;e it plants in the con|&s;titution it&s;elf nece&s;&s;ary u&s;urpations of power, every precedent of which is a germe of unnece&s;&s;ary and multiplied repetitions. If one nation maintains con&s;tantly a di&s;ciplined army ready for the &s;ervice of ambition or revenge, it obliges the mo&s;t pacific nations, who may be within the reach of its enter|prizes, to take corre&s;ponding precautions. The fifteenth century was the unhappy epoch of military e&s;tabli&s;hments in time of peace. They were intro|duced by Charles VII. of France. All Europe has followed, or been forced into the example. Had the example not been followed by other nations, all Europe mu&s;t long ago have worn the chains of a univer&s;al monarch Were every nation except France now to di&s;band its peace e&s;tabli&s;hment, the &s;ame event might follow. The veteran legions of Rome were an overmatch for the undi&s;ciplined valour of all other nations, and rendered her mi&s;tre&s;s of the world.</P>
<P>Not le&s;s true is it, that the liberties of Rome pro|ved the final victim to her military triumphs, and that the liberties of Europe, as far as they ever exi&s;ted, have with few exceptions been the price of her military e&s;tabli&s;hments. A &s;tanding force there|fore is a dangerous, at the &s;ame time that it may be a nece&s;&s;ary provi&s;ion. On the &s;malle&s;t &s;cale it has its inconveniences. On an exten&s;ive &s;cale, its con&s;equences may be fatal. On any &s;cale, it is an object of laudable circum&s;pection and precaution. A wi&s;e nation will combine all the&s;e con&s;iderations;
<PB N="41" REF="021127_0278_0FB23E4683A01DA8">
and whil&s;t it does not ra&s;hly preclude it&s;elf from any re&s;ource which may become e&s;&s;ential to its &s;afety, will exert all its prudence in dimini&s;hing both the nece&s;&s;ity and the danger of re&s;orting to one which may be inau&s;picious to its liberties.</P>
<P>The cleare&s;t marks of this prudence are &s;tamped on the propo&s;ed con&s;titution. The union it&s;elf which it cements and &s;ecures, de&s;troys every pretext for a military e&s;tabli&s;hment which could be dangerous. America, united with a handful of troops, or without a &s;ingle &s;oldier, exhibits a more forbidding po&s;ture to foreign ambition, than America di&s;united, with an hundred thou&s;and veterans ready for combat. It was remarked on a former occa&s;ion, that the want of this pretext had &s;aved the liberties of one nation in Europe. Being rendered by her in&s;ular &s;ituation and her maritime re&s;ources, impregnable to the armies of her neighbours, the rulers of Great-Britain have never been able, by real or artificial dangers, to cheat the public into an exten&s;ive peace e&s;tabli&s;hment. The di&s;tance of the United States from the powerful nations of the world, gives them the &s;ame happy &s;ecurity. A dangerous e&s;tabli&s;hment can never be nece&s;&s;ary or plau&s;ible, &s;o long as they continue a united people. But let it never for a moment be forgotten, that they are indebted for this advantage to their union alone. The moment of its di&s;&s;olution will be the date of a new order of things. The fears of the weaker or the ambition of the &s;tronger &s;tates or confederacies, will &s;et the &s;ame example in the new, as Charles VII. did in the old world. The example will be followed here from the &s;ame motives which produced univer&s;al imitation there. In&s;tead of deriving from our &s;ituation the precious advantage which Great-Britain has derived from hers, the face of America will be but a copy of that of the continent of Europe. It will pre&s;ent liberty every where cru&s;hed between &s;tanding armies and perpetual taxes. The fortunes of di&s;united
<PB N="42" REF="021127_0279_0FB23E4804047528">
America will be even more di&s;a&s;trous than tho&s;e of Europe. The &s;ources of evil in the latter are confined to her own limits. No &s;uperior powers of another quarter of the globe intrigue among her rival nations, inflame their mutual animo&s;ities, and render them the in&s;truments of foreign ambition, jealou&s;y and revenge. In America, the mi&s;eries &s;pringing from her internal jealou&s;ies, contentions and wars, would form a part only of her lot. A plentiful addition of evils would have their &s;ource in that relation in which Europe &s;tands to this quarter of the earth, and which no other quarter of the earth bears to Europe. This picture of the con&s;equences of di&s;union cannot be too highly coloured, or too often exhibited. Every man who loves peace, every man who loves his country, every man who loves liberty, ought to have it ever before his eyes, that he may cheri&s;h in his heart a due attachment to the union of America, and be able to &s;et a due value on the means of pre&s;erving it.</P>
<P>Next to the effectual e&s;tabli&s;hment of the union, the be&s;t po&s;&s;ible precaution again&s;t danger from &s;tanding armies, is a limitation of the term for which revenue may be appropriated to their &s;upport. This precaution the con&s;titution has prudently added. I will not repeat here the ob&s;ervations, which I flatter my&s;elf have placed this &s;ubject in a ju&s;t and &s;atisfac|tory light. But it may not be improper to take notice of an argument again&s;t this part of the con|&s;titution, which has been drawn from the policy and practice of Great-Britain. It is &s;aid that the con|tinuance of an army in that kingdom, requires an annual vote of the legi&s;lature; whereas the American con&s;titution has lengthened this critical period to two years. This is the form in which the compari&s;on is u&s;ually &s;tated to the public: But is it a ju&s;t form? Is it a fair compari&s;on? Does the Briti&s;h con&s;titution re&s;train the parliamentary di&s;cretion to one year? Does the American impo&s;e on the congre&s;s appro|priations
<PB N="43" REF="021127_0280_0FB23E49F8485340">
for two years? On the contrary, it cannot be unknown to the authors of the fallacy them&s;elves, that the Briti&s;h con&s;titution fixes no limit whatever to the di&s;cretion of the legi&s;lature, and that the American ties down the legi&s;lature to two years, as the longe&s;t admi&s;&s;ible term.</P>
<P>Had the argument from the Briti&s;h example been truly &s;tated, it would have &s;tood thus: The term for which &s;upplies may be appropriated to the army e&s;tabli&s;hment, though unlimited by the Briti&s;h con|&s;titution, has neverthele&s;s in practice been limited by parliamentary di&s;cretion, to a &s;ingle year. Now if in Great-Britain, where the hou&s;e of commons is elected for &s;even years; where &s;o great a proportion of the members are elected by &s;o &s;mall a proportion of the people; where the electors are &s;o corrupted by the repre&s;entatives, and the repre&s;entatives &s;o corrupted by the crown, the repre&s;entative body can po&s;&s;e&s;s a power to make appropriations to the army for an indefinite term, without de&s;iring, or without daring, to extend the term beyond a &s;ingle year; ought not &s;u&s;picion her&s;elf to blu&s;h in pretending that the repre&s;entatives of the United States, elected FREELY, by the WHOLE BODY of the people, every SECOND YEAR, cannot be &s;afely entru&s;ted with a di&s;cretion over &s;uch appropriations, expre&s;sly limited to the &s;hort period of TWO YEARS.</P>
<P>A bad cau&s;e &s;eldom fails to betray it&s;elf. Of this truth, the management of the oppo&s;ition to the federal government is an unvaried exemplification. But among all the blunders which have been committed, none is more &s;triking than the attempt to enli&s;t on that &s;ide, the prudent jealou&s;y entertained by the people, of &s;tanding armies. The attempt has awakened fully the public attention to that impor|tant &s;ubject; and has led to inve&s;tigations which mu&s;t terminate in a thorough and univer&s;al conviction, not only that the con&s;titution has provided the mo&s;t effec|tual guards again&s;t danger from that quarter, but
<PB N="44" REF="021127_0281_0FB23E4B0351BB40">
that nothing &s;hort of a con&s;titution fully adequate to the national defence, and the pre&s;ervation of the union, can &s;ave America from as many &s;tanding armies as it may be &s;plit into &s;tates or confederacies; and from &s;uch a progre&s;&s;ive augmentation of the&s;e e&s;tabli&s;hments in each, as will render them as bur|den&s;ome to the properties and ominous to the liberties of the people; as any e&s;tabli&s;hment that can become nece&s;&s;ary, under a united and efficient government, mu&s;t be tolerable to the former, and &s;afe to the latter.</P>
<P>The palpable nece&s;&s;ity of the power to provide and maintain a navy has protected that part of the con|&s;titution again&s;t a &s;pirit of cen&s;ure, which has &s;pared few other parts. It mu&s;t indeed be numbered among the greate&s;t ble&s;&s;ings of America, that as her union will be the only &s;ource of her maritime &s;trength, &s;o this will be a principal &s;ource of her &s;ecurity again&s;t danger from abroad. In this re&s;pect our &s;ituation bears another likene&s;s to the in&s;ular advantage of Great-Britain. The batteries mo&s;t capable of re|pelling foreign enterprizes on our &s;afety, are happily &s;uch as can never be turned by a perfidious govern|ment again&s;t our liberties.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of the Atlantic frontier are all of them deeply intere&s;ted in this provi&s;ion for naval protection, and if they have hitherto been &s;uffered to &s;leep quietly in their beds; if their property has remained &s;afe again&s;t the predatory &s;pirit of licenci|ous adventurers; if their maritime towns have not yet been compelled to ran&s;om them&s;elves from the terrors of a conflagration, by yielding to the exactions of daring and &s;udden invaders, the&s;e in&s;tances of good fortune are not to be a&s;cribed to the capacity of the exi&s;ting government for the protection of tho&s;e from whom it claims allegiance, but to cau&s;es that are fugitive and fallacious. If we except perhaps Virginia and Maryland, which are peculiarly vul|nerable on their ea&s;tern frontiers, no part of the union ought to feel more anxiety on this &s;ubject than
<PB N="45" REF="021127_0282_0FB23E4C8484E7F8">
New-York. Her &s;ea coa&s;t is exten&s;ive. The very important di&s;trict of the &s;tate is an i&s;land. The &s;tate it&s;elf is penetrated by a large navigable river for more than fifty leagues. The great emporium of its commerce, the great re&s;ervoir of its wealth, lies every moment at the mercy of events, and may almo&s;t be regarded as a ho&s;tage, for ignominious compliances with the dictates of a foreign enemy, or even with the rapacious demands of pirates and barbarians. Should a war be the re&s;ult of the pre|carious &s;ituation of European affairs, and all the unruly pa&s;&s;ions attending it, be let loo&s;e on the ocean our e&s;cape from in&s;ults and depredations, not only on that element but every part of the other bordering on it, will be truly miraculous. In the pre&s;ent con|dition of America, the &s;tates more immediately expo&s;ed to the&s;e calamities, have nothing to hope from the phantom of a general government which now exi&s;ts; and if their &s;ingle re&s;ources were equal to the ta&s;k of fortifying them&s;elves again&s;t the dan|ger, the object to be protected would be almo&s;t con|&s;umed by the means of protecting them.</P>
<P>The power of regulating and calling forth the militia has been already &s;ufficiently vindicated and explained.</P>
<P>The power of levying and borrowing money, being the &s;inew of that which is to be exerted in the national defence, is properly thrown into the &s;ame cla&s;s with it. This power al&s;o has been examined already with much attention, and has I tru&s;t been clearly &s;hewn to be nece&s;&s;ary both in the extent and form given to it by the con&s;titution. I will addre&s;s one additional reflection only to tho&s;e who contend that the power ought to have been re&s;trained to ex|ternal taxation, by which they mean taxes on articles imported from other countries. It cannot be doubted that this will always be a valuable <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ource of revenue, that for a con&s;iderable time, it mu&s;t be a principal &s;ource, that at this moment it is an e&s;&s;ential one.
<PB N="46" REF="021127_0283_0FB23E4E03BB46C8">
But we may form very mi&s;taken ideas on this &s;ubject, if we do not call to mind in our calculations, that the extent of revenue drawn from foreign commerce, mu&s;t vary with the variations both in the extent and the kind of imports, and that the&s;e variations do not corre&s;pond with the progre&s;s of population, which mu&s;t be the general mea&s;ure of the public wants. As long as agriculture continues the &s;ole field of labour, the importation of manufactures mu&s;t increa&s;e as the con&s;umers multiply. As &s;oon as dome&s;tic manufac|tures are begun by the hands not called for by agri|culture, the imported manufactures will decrea&s;e as the numbers of people increa&s;e. In a more remote &s;tage, the imports may con&s;i&s;t in con&s;iderable part of raw materials which will be wrought into articles for exportation, and will therefore require rather the encouragement of bounties, than to be loaded with di&s;couraging duties. A &s;y&s;tem of government, meant for duration ought to contemplate the&s;e revolutions, and be able to accommodate it&s;elf to them.</P>
<P>Some who have not denied the nece&s;&s;ity of the power of taxation, have grounded a very fierce attack again&s;t the con&s;titution on the language in which it is defined. It has been urged and echoed, that the power
<Q>to lay and collect taxes, duties, impo&s;ts and exci&s;es, to pay the debts, and provide for the com|mon defence and general welfare of the United States,</Q>
amounts to an unlimited commi&s;&s;ion to exerci&s;e every power which may be alledged to be nece&s;&s;ary for the common defence or general welfare. No &s;tronger proof could be given of the di&s;tre&s;s under which the&s;e writers labour for objections, than their &s;tooping to &s;uch a mi&s;con&s;truction.</P>
<P>Had no other enumeration or definition of the powers of the congre&s;s been found in the con&s;titution, than the general expre&s;&s;ions ju&s;t cited, the authors of the objection might have had &s;ome colour for it; though it would have been difficult to find a rea&s;on for &s;o aukward a form of de&s;cribing an authority to
<PB N="47" REF="021127_0284_0FB23E4F8301FD30">
legi&s;late in all po&s;&s;ible ca&s;es. A power to de&s;troy the freedom of the pre&s;s, the trial by jury or even to regulate the cour&s;e of de&s;cents, or the forms of con|veyances, mu&s;t be very &s;ingularly expre&s;&s;ed by the terms "to rai&s;e money for the general welfare."</P>
<P>But what colour can the objection have, when a &s;pecification of the objects alluded to by the&s;e general terms, immediately follows; and is not even &s;epara|ted by a longer pau&s;e than a &s;emicolon. If the different parts of the &s;ame in&s;trument ought to be &s;o expounded as to give meaning to every part which will bear it; &s;hall one part of the &s;ame &s;entence be excluded altogether from a &s;hare in the meaning; and &s;hall the more doubtful and indefinite terms be retained in their full extent and the clear and preci&s;e expre&s;&s;ions, be denied any &s;ignification what&s;oever? For what purpo&s;e could the enumeration of particular powers be in&s;erted, if the&s;e and all others were meant to be included in the preceding general power? Nothing is more natural or common than fir&s;t to u&s;e a general phra&s;e, and then to explain and qualify it by a recital of particulars. But the idea of an enu|meration of particulars, which neither explain nor qualify the general meaning, and can have no other effect than to confound and mi&s;lead, is an ab&s;urdity which as we are reduced to the dilemma of charging either on the authors of the objection, or on the au|thors of the con&s;titution, we mu&s;t take the liberty of &s;uppo&s;ing, had not its origin with the latter.</P>
<P>The objection here is the more extraordinary, as it appears, that the language u&s;ed by the convention is a copy from the articles of confederation. The objects of the union among the &s;tates as de&s;cribed in article 3d. are,
<Q>their common defence, &s;ecurity of their liberties, and mutual and general welfare.</Q>
The terms of article 8th, are &s;till more identical.
<Q>All charges of war, and all other expences, that &s;hall be incurred for the common defence or general welfare, and allowed by the United States in con|gre&s;s

A &s;imilar language again occurs in article 9. Con&s;true either of the&s;e articles by the rules which would ju&s;tify the con&s;truction put on the new con&s;titu|tion, and they ve&s;t in the exi&s;ting Congre&s;s a power to le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i&s;late in all ca&s;es what&s;oever.

I appeal to the objectors them&s;elves, whether they would in that ca&s;e have employed the &s;ame rea&s;oning in ju&s;tification of congre&s;s, as they now make u&s;e of again&s;t the convention.

The term amba&s;&s;ador, if taken &s;trictly, as &s;eems to be required by the &s;econd of the articles of confederation, comprehends the highe&s;t grade only of public mini&s;ters; and excludes the grades which the United States will be mo&s;t likely to prefer where foreign emba&s;&s;ies may be nece&s;&s;ary. And under no latitude of con&s;truction will the term comprehend con&s;uls. Yet it has been found expedient, and has been the practice of congre&s;s to employ the inferior grades of public mini&s;ters; and to &s;end and receive con&s;uls. It is true that where treaties of commerce &s;tipulate for the mutual appointment of con&s;uls, who&s;e functions are connected with commerce, the admi&s;&s;ion of foreign con&s;uls may fall within the power of making commercial treaties; and that where no &s;uch treaties exi&s;t, the mi&s;&s;ion of American con&s;uls into foreign countries, may <HI>perhaps</HI> be covered under the authority given by the 9th article of the confederation, to appoint all &s;uch civil officers as may be nece&s;&s;ary for managing the general affairs of the United States. But the admi&s;&s;ion of con&s;uls into the United States, where no previous treaty has &s;tipulated it, &s;eems to have been no where provided for. A &s;upply of the omi&s;&s;ion is one of the le&s;&s;er in&s;tances in which the convention have improved on the model before them. But the mo&s;t minute pro|vi&s;ions become important when they tend to obviate the nece&s;&s;ity or the pretext for gradual and unob&s;erved u&s;urpations of power. A li&s;t of the ca&s;es in which
<PB N="50" REF="021127_0287_0FB23E54666763F0">
congre&s;s have been betrayed, or forced by the defects of the confederation into violations of their chartered authorities, would not a little &s;urpri&s;e tho&s;e who have paid no attention to the &s;ubject; and would be no incon&s;iderable argument in favor of the new con&s;ti|tution, which &s;eems to have provided no le&s;s &s;tudi|ou&s;ly for the le&s;&s;er, than the more obvious and &s;triking defects of the old.</P>
<P>The power to define and puni&s;h piracies and felonies committed on the high &s;eas, and offences again&s;t the law of nations, belongs with equal propriety to the general government; and is a &s;till greater improve|ment on the articles of confederation.</P>
<P>The&s;e articles contain no provi&s;ion for the ca&s;e of offences again&s;t the law of nations; and con&s;equently leave it in the power of any indi&s;creet member to embroil the confederacy with foreign nations.</P>
<P>The provi&s;ion of the federal articles on the &s;ubject of piracies and felonies, extends no farther than to the e&s;tabli&s;hment of courts for the trial of the&s;e offences. The definition of piracies might perhaps, without inconveniency, be left to the law of nations; though a legi&s;lative definition of them is found in mo&s;t municipal codes. A definition of felonies on the high &s;eas is evidently requi&s;ite. Felony is a term of loo&s;e &s;ignification even in the common law of England; and of various import in the &s;tatute law of that kingdom. But neither the common, nor the &s;tatute law of that or of any other nation, ought to be a &s;tandard for the proceedin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> of this, unle&s;s previou&s;ly made its own by legi&s;lative adoption. The meaning of the term as defined in the codes of the &s;everal &s;tates, would be as impracticable as the former would be a di&s;honorable and illegitimate guide. It is not preci&s;ely the &s;ame in any two of the &s;tates; and varies in each with every revi&s;ion of its criminal laws. For the &s;ake of certainty and uni|formity therefore, the power of defining felonies in this ca&s;e, was in every re&s;pect nece&s;&s;ary and proper.</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="021127_0288_0FB23E5583B493F0">The regulation of foreign commerce, having fallen within &s;everal views which have been taken of this &s;ubject, has been too fully di&s;cu&s;&s;ed to need addi|tional proofs here of its being properly &s;ubmitted to the federal admini&s;tration.</P>
<P>It were doubtle&s;s to be wi&s;hed that the power of prohibiting the importation of &s;laves, had not been po&s;tponed until the year 1808, or rather that it had been &s;uffered to have immediate operation. But it is not difficult to account either for this re&s;triction on the general government, or for the manner in which the whole clau&s;e is expre&s;&s;ed. It ought to be con&s;i|dered as a great point gained in favor of humanity, that a period of twenty years may terminate for ever within the&s;e &s;tates, a traffic which has &s;o long and &s;o loudly upbraided the barbari&s;m of modern policy; that within that period it will receive a con&s;iderable di&s;couragement from the federal government, and may be totally aboli&s;hed by a concurrence of the few &s;tates which continue the unnatural traffic, in the prohibitory example which has been given by &s;o great a majority of the union. Happy would it be for the unfortunate Africans, if an equal pro&s;pect lay before them, of being redeemed from the oppre&s;|&s;ions of their European brethren!</P>
<P>Attempts have been made to pervert this clau&s;e into an objection again&s;t the con&s;titution, by repre|&s;enting it on one &s;ide as a criminal toleration of an illicit practice, and on another, as calculated to prevent voluntary and beneficial emigrations from Europe to America.

<P><PB N="52" REF="021127_0289_0FB23E5704717768">Under this head might be included the particular re&s;traints impo&s;ed on the authority of the &s;tates, and certain powers of the judicial department; but the former are re&s;erved for a di&s;tinct cla&s;s, and the latter will be particularly examined when we arrive at the &s;tructure and organization of the government.

<P>The defect of power in the exi&s;ting confederacy, to regulate the commerce between its &s;everal members, is in the number of tho&s;e which have been clearly pointed out by experience. To the proofs and remarks which former papers have brought into view on this &s;ubject, it may be added, that without this &s;upplemental provi&s;ion, the great and e&s;&s;ential power of regulating foreign commerce, would have been incomplete, and ineffectual. A very material object of this power was the relief of the &s;tates which import and export through other &s;tates, from the improper contributions levied on them by the latter. Were the&s;e at liberty to regulate the trade between &s;tate and &s;tate, it mu&s;t be fore&s;een that ways would be found out, to load the articles of import and export, during the pa&s;&s;age through their juri&s;diction, with duties which would fall on the makers of the latter, and the con&s;umers of the f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r: We may be a&s;&s;ured by pa&s;t experience, that &s;uch a practice would be

introduced by future contrivances; and both by that and a common knowledge of human affairs, that it would nouri&s;h uncea&s;ing animo&s;ities, and not impro|bably terminate in &s;erious interruptions of the public tranquility. To tho&s;e who do not view the que&s;tion through the medium of pa&s;&s;ion or of intere&s;t, the de&s;ire of the commercial &s;tates to collect in any form, an indirect revenue from their uncommercial neigh|bours, mu&s;t appear not le&s;s impolitic than it is unfair; &s;ince it would &s;timulate the injured party, by re&s;ent|ment as well as intere&s;t, to re&s;ort to le&s;s convenient channels for their foreign trade. But the mild voice of rea&s;on, pleading the cau&s;e of an enlarged and permanent intere&s;t, is but too often drowned before public bodies as well as individuals, by the clamours of an impatient avidity for immediate and immo|derate gain.</P>
<P>The nece&s;&s;ity of a &s;uperintending authority over the reciprocal trade of confederated &s;tates has been illu&s;trated by other examples as well as our own. In Switzerland, where the union is &s;o very &s;light, each canton is obliged to allow to merchandizes, a pa&s;&s;age through its juri&s;diction into other cantons, without an augmentation of the tolls. In Germany, it is a law of the empire, that the princes and &s;tates &s;hall not lay tolls or cu&s;toms on bridges, rivers, or pa&s;&s;ages, without the con&s;ent of the emperor and diet; though it appears from a quotation in an ante|cedent paper, that the practice in this as in many other in&s;tances in that confederacy, has not followed the law, and has produce<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> there the mi&s;chiefs which have been fore&s;een here. Among the re&s;traints impo&s;ed by the union of the Netherlands, on its members, one is, that they &s;hall not e&s;tabli&s;h impo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ts di&s;advantageous to their neighbours, without the general permi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The regulation of commerce with the Indian tribes is very properly unfettered from two limitations in the articles of confederation, which render the provi&s;ion
<PB N="54" REF="021127_0291_0FB24756DC967758">
ob&s;cure and contradictory. The power is there re&s;trained to Indians, no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> members of any of the &s;tates, and is not to violate or infringe the legi&s;lative right of any &s;tate within its own limits. What de&s;cription of Indians are to be deemed members of a &s;tate, is not yet &s;ettled; and has been a que&s;tion of frequent perplexity and contention in the federal councils. And how the trade with Indians, though not members of a &s;tate, yet re&s;iding within its legi&s;|lative juri&s;diction, can be regulated by an external authority, without &s;o far intruding on the internal rights of legi&s;lation, is ab&s;olutely incomprehen&s;ible. This is not the only ca&s;e in which the articles of confederation have incon&s;iderately endeavoured to accompli&s;h impo&s;&s;ibilities; to reconcile a partial &s;overeignty in the union, with complete &s;overeignty in the &s;tates; to &s;ubvert a mathematical axiom, by taking away a part, and letting the whole remain.</P>
<P>All that need be remarked on the power to coin money, regulate the value thereof, and of foreign coin, is that by providing for this la&s;t ca&s;e, the con|&s;titution has &s;upplied a material omi&s;&s;ion in the arti|cles of confederation. The authority of the exi&s;ting congre&s;s is re&s;trained to the regulation of coin <HI>&s;truck</HI> by their own authority, or that of the re&s;pective &s;tates. It mu&s;t be &s;een at once, that the propo&s;ed uniformity in the <HI>value</HI> of the current coin might be de&s;troyed by &s;ubjecting that of foreign coin to the different regulations of the different &s;tates.</P>
<P>The puni&s;hment of counterfeiting the public &s;ecu|rities as well as of the current coin, is &s;ubmitted of cour&s;e to that authority, which is to &s;ecure the value of both.</P>
<P>The regulation of weights and mea&s;ures is trans|ferred from the articles of confederation, and is founded on like con&s;iderations with the preceding power of regulating coin.</P>
<P>The di&s;&s;imilarity in the rules of naturalization, has long been remarked as a fault in our &s;y&s;tem, and as
<PB N="55" REF="021127_0292_0FB24749BA492868">
laying a foundation for intricate and delicate que&s;tions. In the 4th article of the confederation, it is declared
<Q>that the <HI>free inhabitants</HI> of each of the&s;e &s;tates, paupers, vagabonds, and fugitives from ju&s;tice excepted, &s;hall be entitled to all privileges and immunities of <HI>free citizens,</HI> in the &s;everal &s;tates, and <HI>the people</HI> of each &s;tate, &s;hall in every other, enjoy all the privileges of trade and commerce, &amp;c.</Q>
There is a confu&s;ion of language here, which is remarkable. Why the terms <HI>free inhabitants,</HI> are u&s;ed in one part of the article; <HI>free citizens</HI> in another, and <HI>people</HI> in another, or what was meant by &s;upperadding
<Q>to all privileges and immunities of free citizens,</Q>
&mdash;
<Q>all the privileges of trade and commerce,</Q>
cannot ea&s;ily be determined. It &s;eems to be a con&s;truction &s;carcely avoidable, however that tho&s;e who come under the denomination of <HI>free inha|bitants</HI> of a &s;tate, although not citizens of &s;uch &s;tate, are entitled in every other &s;tate to all the privileges of <HI>free citizens</HI> of the latter; that is, to greater privileges than they may be entitled to in their own &s;tate; &s;o that it may be in the power of a particular &s;tate, or rather every &s;tate is laid under a nece&s;&s;ity, not only to confer the rights of citizen&s;hip in other &s;tates upon any whom it may admit to &s;uch rights within it&s;elf; but upon any whom it may allow to become inha|bitants within its juri&s;diction. But were an expo|&s;ition of the term "inhabitants" to be admitted, which would confine the &s;tipulated privileges citizens alone, the difficulty is dimini&s;hed only, not removed. The very improper power would &s;till be retained by each &s;tate, of naturalizing aliens in every other &s;tate. In one &s;tate re&s;idence for a &s;hort term confers all the rights of citizen&s;hip. In another qualifications of greater importance are required. An alien therefore legally incapacitated for certain rights in the latter, may by previous re&s;idence only in the former elude his incapacity; and thus the law of one &s;tate, be prepo&s;terou&s;ly rendered paramount to
<PB N="56" REF="021127_0293_0FB2474B9DF84590">
the law of another within the juri&s;diction of the other. We owe it to mere ca&s;ualty, that very &s;erious embar|ra&s;&s;ments on this &s;ubject have been hitherto e&s;caped. By the laws of &s;everal &s;tates, certain de&s;criptions of aliens who had rendered them&s;elves obnoxious, were laid under interdicts incon&s;i&s;tent, not only with the rights of citizen&s;hip, but with the privileges of re&s;idence. What would have been the con&s;equence, if &s;uch per&s;ons, by re&s;idence o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> otherwi&s;e, had acquired the character of citizens under the laws of another &s;tate, and then a&s;&s;erted their rights as &s;uch, both to re&s;idence and citizen&s;hip within the &s;tate pro&s;cribing them? Whatever the legal con&s;equences might have been, other con&s;equences would pro|bably have re&s;ulted of too &s;erious a nature, not to be provided again&s;t. The new con&s;titution has accor|dingly with great propriety made provi&s;ion again&s;t them, and all others proceeding from the defect of the confederation, on this head by authori&s;ing the general government to e&s;tabli&s;h an uniform rule of naturalization throughout the United States.</P>
<P>The power of e&s;tabli&s;hing uniform laws of bank|ruptcy, is &s;o intimately connected with the regulation of commerce, and will prevent &s;o many frauds where the parties or their property may lie or be removed into different &s;tates, that the expediency of it &s;eems not likely to be drawn into que&s;tion.</P>
<P>The power of pre&s;cribing by general laws the manner in which the public acts, records and judicial proceedings of each &s;tate &s;hall be proved, and the effect they &s;hall have in other &s;tates, is an evident and valuable improvement on the clau&s;e relating to this &s;ubject in the articles of confederation. The mean|ing of the latter is extremely indeterminate; and can be of little importance under any interpretation which it will bear. The power here e&s;tabli&s;hed, may be rendered a very conven<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">nt in&s;trument of ju&s;tice, and be particularly benefic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">l on the borders of con|tiguous &s;tates, where the effects liable to ju&s;tice, may

<P>The power of e&s;tabli&s;hing po&s;t-roads, mu&s;t in every view be a harmle&s;s power; and may perhaps, by judicious management, become productive of great public conveniency.

<P>The indi&s;pen&s;ible nece&s;&s;ity of compleat a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">thority at the &s;eat of government, carries its own evidence with it. It is a power exerci&s;ed by every legi&s;lature of the union, I might &s;ay of the world, by virtue of its general &s;upremacy. Without it, not only the public authority might be in&s;ulted and its proceedings be interrupted, with impunity; but a dependence of the members of the general government on the &s;tate, comprehending the &s;eat of the government for pro|tection in the exerci&s;e of their duty, might bring on the national councils an imputation of awe or influence, equally di&s;honorable to the government, and di&s;&s;atisfactory to the other members of the confe|deracy. This con&s;ideration has the more weight as the gradual accumulation of public improvements at the &s;tationary re&s;idence of the government, would be both too great a public pledge to be left in the hands of a &s;ingle &s;tate; and would create &s;o many ob&s;tacles to a removal of the government, as &s;till further to abridge its nece&s;&s;ary independence. The extent of this federal di&s;trict is &s;ufficiently circum&s;cribed to &s;atisfy every jealou&s;y of an oppo&s;ite nature. And as it is to be appropriated to this u&s;e with the con&s;ent of the &s;tate ceding it; as the &s;tate will no doubt provide in the compact for the rights, and the con&s;ent of the citizens inhabiting it; as the inhabitants will find &s;ufficient inducements of intere&s;t to become willing parties to the ce&s;&s;ion; as they will have had their voice in the election of the government which is to exerci&s;e authority over them; as a municipal legi&s;lature for local purpo&s;es, derived from their own &s;uffrages, will of cour&s;e be allowed them; and as the authority of the legi&s;lature of the &s;tate, and of the inhabitants of the ceded part of it, to concur in the ce&s;&s;ion, will be derived from the whole people of the &s;tate, in their adoption of the con&s;titution, every imaginable objection &s;eems to be obviated.</P>

The more intimate the nature of &s;uch a union may be, the greater intere&s;t have the members in the political in&s;titutions of each other; and the greater right to in&s;i&s;t that the forms of government under which the compact was entered into, &s;hould be <HI>&s;ub&s;tantially</HI> maintained. But a right implies a remedy; and where el&s;e could the remedy be depo&s;ited, than where it is depo&s;ited by the con&s;ti|tution? Governments of di&s;&s;imilar principles and forms, have been found le&s;s adapted to a federal coalition of any &s;ort, than tho&s;e of a kindred nature. <Q>As the confederate republic of Germany, &s;ays Monte&s;quieu,
con&s;i&s;ts of free cities and petty &s;tates, &s;ubject to different princes, experience &s;hows us that it is more imperfect than that of Holland and Switzerland. Greece was un|done,
he adds,
as &s;oon as the king of Macedon obtained a &s;eat among the Amphyctions.</Q>
In the latter ca&s;e, no doubt, the di&s;proportionate force, as well as the monarchical form of the new confederate, had its &s;hare of influence on the events. It may po&s;&s;ibly be a&s;ked what need there could be of &s;uch a precaution, and whether it may not become a pretext for alterations in the &s;tate governments, without the concurrence of the &s;tates them&s;elves. The&s;e que&s;tions admit of ready an&s;wers. If the interpo&s;ition of the general government &s;hould not be needed, the pro|vi&s;ion for &s;uch an event will be a harmle&s;s &s;uperfluity only in the con&s;titution. But who can &s;ay what experiments may be produced by the caprice of par|ticular &s;tates, by the ambition of enterprizing leaders, or by the intrigues and influence of foreign powers, To the &s;econd que&s;tion it may be an&s;wered, that if the general government &s;hould interpo&s;e by virtue of this con&s;titutional authority, it will be of cour&s;e bound to pur&s;ue the authority. But the authority extends no farther than to a <HI>guaranty</HI> of a republican form of government, which &s;uppo&s;es a pre-exi&s;ting
<PB N="62" REF="021127_0299_0FB2476648FABC90">
government of the form which is to be guaranteed. As long therefore as the exi&s;ting republican forms are continued by the &s;tates, they are guaranteed by the federal con&s;titution. Whenever the &s;tates may chu&s;e to &s;ub&s;titute other republican forms, they have a right to do &s;o, and to claim the federal guaranty for the latter. The only re&s;triction impo&s;ed on them is, that they &s;hall not exchange republican for anti-republican con&s;titutions; a re&s;triction which it is pre&s;umed will hardly be con&s;idered as a grievance.</P>
<P>A protection again&s;t inva&s;ion is due from every &s;ociety to the parts compo&s;ing it. The latitude of the expre&s;&s;ion here u&s;ed, &s;eems to &s;ecure each &s;tate not only again&s;t foreign ho&s;tility, but again&s;t ambitious or vindictive enterprizes of its more powerful neigh|bours. The hi&s;tory both of antient and modern confederacies, proves that the weaker members of the union ought not to be in&s;en&s;ible to the policy of this article.</P>
<P>Protection again&s;t dome&s;tic violence is added with equal propriety. It has been remarked that even among the Swi&s;s cantons, which properly &s;peaking are not under one government, provi&s;ion is made for this object; and the hi&s;tory of that league informs us, that mutual aid is frequently claimed and afforded; and as well by the mo&s;t democratic, as the other cantons. A recent and well known event among our&s;elves, has warned us to be prepared for emer|gencies of a like nature.</P>
<P>At fir&s;t view it might &s;eem not to &s;quare with the republican theory, to &s;uppo&s;e either that a majority have not the right, or that a minority will have the force to &s;ubvert a government; and con&s;equently that the federal interpo&s;ition can never be required but when it would be improper. But theoretic rea&s;oning in this, as in mo&s;t other ca&s;es, mu&s;t be qualified by the le&s;&s;ons of practice. Why may not illicit combinations for purpo&s;es of violence be formed as well by a majority of a &s;tate, e&s;pecially a
<PB N="63" REF="021127_0300_0FB247686C562C88">
&s;mall &s;tate, as by a majority of a county or a di&s;trict of the &s;ame &s;tate; and if the authority of the &s;tate ought in the latter ca&s;e to protect the local magi|&s;tracy, ought not the federal authority in the former to &s;upport the &s;tate authority? Be&s;ides, there are certain parts of the &s;tate con&s;titutions which are &s;o interwoven with the federal con&s;titution, that a violent blow cannot be given to the one without communicating the wound to the other. In&s;urrections in a &s;tate will rarely induce a federal interpo&s;ition, unle&s;s the number concerned in them, bear &s;ome pro|portion to the friends of government. It will be much better that the violence in &s;uch ca&s;es &s;hould be repre&s;&s;ed by the &s;uperintending power, than that the majority &s;hould be left to maintain their cau&s;e by a bloody and ob&s;tinate conte&s;t. The exi&s;tence of a right to interpo&s;e will generally prevent the nece&s;&s;ity of exerting it.</P>
<P>Is it true that force and right are nece&s;&s;arily on the &s;ame &s;ide in republican governments? May not the minor party po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;uch a &s;uperiority of pecuniary re&s;ources, of military talents and experience, or of &s;ecret &s;uccours from foreign powers, as will render it &s;uperior al&s;o in an appeal to the &s;word? May not a more compact and advantageous po&s;ition turn the &s;cale on the &s;ame &s;ide again&s;t a &s;uperior number &s;o &s;ituated as to be le&s;s capable of a prompt and col|lected exertion of its &s;trength? Nothing can be more chimerical than to imagine that in a trial of actual force, victory may be calculated by the rules which prevail in a cen&s;us of the inhabitants, or which determine the event of an election! May it not happen in fine that the minority of <HI>citizens</HI> may become a majority of <HI>per&s;ons,</HI> by the acce&s;&s;ion of alien re&s;idents, of a ca&s;ual concour&s;e of adventurers, or of tho&s;e whom the con&s;titution of the &s;tate has not admitted to the rights of &s;uffrage? I take no notice of an unhappy &s;pecies of population abounding in &s;ome of the &s;tates, who during the calm of regular

government are &s;unk below the level of men; but who in the tempe&s;tuous &s;cenes of civil violence may emerge into the human character, and give a &s;upe|riority of &s;trength to any party with which they may a&s;&s;ociate them&s;elves.</P>
<P>In ca&s;es where it may be doubtful on which &s;ide ju&s;tice lies, what better umpires could be de&s;ired by two violent factions, flying to arms and tearing a &s;tate to pieces, than the repre&s;entatives of confederate &s;tates not heated by the local flame? To the impar|tiality of judges they would unite the affection of friends. Happy would it be if &s;uch a remedy for its infirmities, could be enjoyed by all free govern|ments; if a project equally effectual could be e&s;ta|bli&s;hed for the univer&s;al peace of mankind.</P>
<P>Should it be a&s;ked what is to be the redre&s;s for an in&s;urrection pervading all the &s;tates, and comprizing a &s;uperiority of the entire force, though not a con|&s;titutional right; the an&s;wer mu&s;t be, that &s;uch a ca&s;e, as it would be without the compa&s;s of human remedies, &s;o it is fortunately not within the compa&s;s of human probability; and that it is a &s;ufficient recommendation of the federal con&s;titution, that it dimini&s;hes the ri&s;k of a calamity, for which no po&s;|&s;ible con&s;titution can provide a cure.</P>
<P>Among the advantages of a confederate republic enumerated by Monte&s;quieu, an important one is,
<Q>that &s;hould a popular in&s;urrection happen in one of the &s;tates, the others are able to quell it. Should abu&s;es creep into one part, they are reformed by tho&s;e that remain &s;ound.</Q></P>

<P>This can only be con&s;idered as a declaratory pro|po&s;ition; and may have been in&s;erted, among other rea&s;ons, for the &s;atisfaction of the foreign creditors

of the United States, who cannot be &s;trangers to the pretended doctrine that a change in the political form of civil &s;ociety, has the magical effect of di&s;&s;olv|ing its moral obligations.</P>
<P>Among the le&s;&s;er critici&s;ms which have been exerci&s;ed on the con&s;titution, it has been remarked that the validity of engagements ought to have been a&s;&s;erted in favor of the United States, as well as again&s;t them; and in the &s;pirit which u&s;ually cha|racteri&s;es little critics, the omi&s;&s;ion has been tran&s;|formed and magnified into a plot again&s;t the national rights. The authors of this di&s;covery may be told, what few others need be informed of, that as engage|ments are in their nature reciprocal, an a&s;&s;ertion of their validity on one &s;ide nece&s;&s;arily involves a vali|dity on the other &s;ide; and that as the article is merely declaratory, the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the principle in one ca&s;e is &s;ufficient for every ca&s;e. They may be further told that every con&s;titution mu&s;t limit its precautions to dangers that are not altogether ima|ginary; and that no real danger can exi&s;t that the government would <HI>dare,</HI> with or even without this con&s;titutional declaration before it, to remit the debts ju&s;tly due to the public, on the pretext here condemned.</P>

<Q>To provide for amendments to be ratified by three-fourths of the &s;tates, under two excep|tions only.</Q></P>
<P>That u&s;eful alterations will be &s;ugge&s;ted by expe|rience, could not but be fore&s;een. It was requi&s;ite therefore that a mode for introducing them &s;hould be provided. The mode preferred by the convention &s;eems to be &s;tamped with every mark of propriety. It guards equally again&s;t that extreme facility which would render the con&s;titution too mutable; and that extreme difficulty which might perpetuate its di&s;|covered faults. It moreover equally enables the general and the &s;tate governments to originate the amendment of errors as they may be pointed out by

the experience on one &s;ide or on the other. The exception in favor of the equality of &s;uffrage in the &s;enate was probably meant as a palladium to the re&s;iduary &s;overeignty of the &s;tates, implied and &s;ecured by that principle of repre&s;entation in one branch of the legi&s;lature; and was probably in&s;i&s;ted on by the &s;tates particularly attached to that equality.

<Q>The ratification of the conventions of nine &s;tates &s;hall be &s;ufficient for the e&s;tabli&s;hment of this con&s;titution between the &s;tates ratifying the &s;ame.</Q></P>
<P>This article &s;peaks for it&s;elf. The expre&s;s autho|rity of the people alone could give due validity to the con&s;titution. To have required the unanimous ratification of the thirteen &s;tates, would have &s;ubjec|ted the e&s;&s;ential intere&s;ts of the whole to the caprice or corruption of a &s;ingle member. It would have marked a want of fore&s;ight in the convention, which our own experience would have rendered inexcu&s;eable.</P>
<P>Two que&s;tions of a very delicate nature pre&s;ent them&s;elves on this occa&s;ion. 1. On what principle the confederation, which &s;tands in the &s;olemn form of a compact among the &s;tates, can be &s;uperceded without the unanimous con&s;ent of the parties to it? 2. What relation is to &s;ub&s;i&s;t between the nine or more &s;tates ratifying the con&s;titution, and the remaining few who do not become parties to it.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t que&s;tion is an&s;wered at once by recurring to the ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of the ca&s;e; to the great principle of &s;elf pre&s;ervation; to the tran&s;cendent law of nature and of nature's God, which declares that the &s;afety and happine&s;s of &s;ociety, are the objects at which all political in&s;titutions aim, and to which all &s;uch in&s;titutions mu&s;t be &s;acrificed. <HI>Perhaps</HI> al&s;o an an&s;wer may be found without &s;earch|ing beyond the principles of the compact it&s;elf. It
<PB N="67" REF="021127_0304_0FB24773B4991298">
has been heretofore noted among the defects of the confederation, that in many of the &s;tates, it had received no higher &s;anction than a mere legi&s;lative ratification. The principle of reciprocality &s;eems to require, that its obligation on the other &s;tates &s;hould be reduced to the &s;ame &s;tandard. A compact between independent &s;overeigns, founded on acts of legi&s;lative authority, can pretend to no higher validity than a league or treaty between the parties. It is an e&s;tabli&s;hed doctrine on the &s;ubject of treaties that all the articles are mutually conditions of each other; that a breach of any one article is a breach of the whole treaty; and that a breach committed by either of the parties ab&s;olves the others; and autho|ri&s;es them, if they plea&s;e, to pronounce the compact violated and void. Should it unhappily be nece&s;&s;ary to appeal to the&s;e delicate truths for a ju&s;tification for di&s;pen&s;ing with the con&s;ent of particular &s;tates to a di&s;&s;olution of the federal pact, will not the com|plaining parties find it a difficult ta&s;k to an&s;wer the <HI>multiplied</HI> and <HI>important</HI> infractions with which they may confronted? The time has been when it was incumbent on us all to veil the ideas which this paragraph exhibits. The &s;cene is now changed and with it, the part which the &s;ame motives dictate.</P>
<P>The &s;econd que&s;tion is not le&s;s delicate; and the flattering pro&s;pect of its being merely hypothetical, forbids an over-curious di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of it. It is one of tho&s;e ca&s;es which mu&s;t be left to provide for it&s;elf. In general it may be ob&s;erved, that although no political relation can &s;ub&s;i&s;t between the a&s;&s;enting and di&s;&s;enting &s;tates, yet the moral relations will remain uncancelled. The claims of ju&s;tice, both on one &s;ide and on the other, will be in force, and mu&s;t be fulfilled; the rights of humanity mu&s;t in all ca&s;es be duly and mutually re&s;pected; whil&s;t con&s;idera|tions of a common intere&s;t, and above all the remem|brance of the endearing &s;cenes which are pa&s;t, and

<P>A <HI>Fifth</HI> cla&s;s of provi&s;ions in favor of the federal authority, con&s;i&s;ts of the following re&s;trictions on the authority of the &s;everal &s;tates.</P>
<P N="1">1.
<Q>No &s;tate &s;hall enter into any treaty, alliance or confederation, grant letters of marque and repri&s;al, coin money, emit bills of credit, make any thing but gold and &s;ilver a legal tender in payment of debt; pa&s;s any bill of attainder, <HI>ex po&s;t facto</HI> law, or law impairing the obligation of contracts, or grant any title of nobility.</Q></P>
<P>The prohibition again&s;t treaties, alliances and confederations, makes a part of the exi&s;ting articles of union; and for rea&s;ons which need no explana|tion, is copied into the new con&s;titution. The pro|hibition of letters of marque is another part of the old &s;y&s;tem, but is &s;omewhat extended in the new. According to the former, letters of marque could be granted by the &s;tates, after a declaration of war. According to the latter, the&s;e licences mu&s;t be ob|tained as well during war as previous to its decla|ration, from the government of the United States. This alteration is fully ju&s;tified by the advantage of uniformity in all points which relate to foreign powers; and of immediate re&s;pon&s;ibility to the nation in all tho&s;e, for who&s;e conduct the nation it&s;elf is to be re&s;pon&s;ible.</P>
<P>The right of coining money, which is here taken from the &s;tates, was left in their hands by the confe|deration
<PB N="69" REF="021127_0306_0FB24F5FB26876F8">
as a concurrent right with that of congre&s;s, under an exception in favor of the exclu&s;ive right of congre&s;s to regulate the alloy and value. In this in&s;tance al&s;o the new provi&s;ion is an improvement on the old. Whil&s;t the alloy and value depended on the general authority, a right of coinage in the par|ticular &s;tates could have no other effect than to mul|tiply expen&s;ive mints, and diver&s;ify the forms and weights of the circulating pieces. The latter incon|veniency defeats one purpo&s;e for which the power was originally &s;ubmitted to the federal head. And as far as the former might prevent an inconvenient remittance of gold and &s;ilver to the central mint for recoinage, the end can be as well attained by local mints e&s;tabli&s;hed under the general authority.</P>
<P>The exten&s;ion of the prohibition to bills of credit mu&s;t give plea&s;ure to every citizen in proportion to his love of ju&s;tice, and his knowledge of the true &s;prings of public pro&s;perity. The lo&s;s which Ame|rica has &s;u&s;tained &s;ince the peace, from the pe&s;tilent effects of paper money, on the nece&s;&s;ary confidence between man and man; on the nece&s;&s;ary confidence in the public councils; on the indu&s;try and morals of the people, and on the character of republican go|vernment, con&s;titutes an enormous debt again&s;t the &s;tates chargeable with this unadvi&s;ed mea&s;ure, which mu&s;t long remain un&s;atisfied; or rather an accumu|lation of guilt, which can be expiated no otherwi&s;e than by a voluntary &s;acrifice on the alter of ju&s;tice, of the power which has been the in&s;trument of it. In addition to the&s;e per&s;ua&s;ive con&s;iderations, it may be ob&s;erved that the &s;ame rea&s;ons which &s;hew the nece&s;&s;ity of denying to the &s;tates the power of regulating coin, prove with equal force that they ought not to be at liberty to &s;ub&s;titute a paper medium in the place of coin. Had every &s;tate a right to regulate the value of its coin, there might be as many different currencies as &s;tates; and thus the intercour&s;e among them would be impeded;
<PB N="70" REF="021127_0307_0FB24F612BF616E0">
retro&s;pective alterations in its value might be made, and thus the citizens of other &s;tates be injured, and animo&s;ities be kindled among the &s;tates them&s;elves. The &s;ubjects of foreign powers might &s;uffer from the &s;ame cau&s;e, and hence the union be di&s;credited and embroiled by the indi&s;cretion of a &s;ingle mem|ber. No one of the&s;e mi&s;chiefs is le&s;s incident to a power in the &s;tates to emit paper money, than to coin gold or &s;ilver. The power to make any thing but gold and &s;ilver a tender in payment of debts, is withdrawn from the &s;tates, on the &s;ame principle with that of &s;triking of paper currency.</P>
<P>Bills of attainder, <HI>ex po&s;t facto</HI> laws, and laws impairing the obligation of contracts, are contrary to the fir&s;t principles of the &s;ocial compact, and to every principle of &s;ound legi&s;lation. The two former are expres&s;ly prohibited by the declarations prefixed to &s;ome of the &s;tate con&s;titutions, and all of them are prohibited by the &s;pirit and &s;cope of the&s;e fun|damental charters. Our own experience has taught us neverthele&s;s, that additional fences again&s;t the&s;e dangers ought not to be omitted. Very properly therefore have the convention added this con&s;titu|tional bulwark in favor of per&s;onal &s;ecurity and pri|vate rights; and I am much deceived if they have not in &s;o doing as faithfully con&s;ulted the genuine &s;entiments, as the undoubted intere&s;ts of their con|&s;tituents. The &s;ober people of America are weary of the fluctuating policy which has directed the public councils. They have &s;een with regret and with indignation, that &s;udden changes and legi&s;lative interferences in ca&s;es affecting per&s;onal rights, become jobs in the hands of enterprizing and influ|ential &s;peculators; and &s;nares to the more indu&s;tri|ous and le&s;s informed part of the community. They have &s;een too, that one legi&s;lative interference is but the fir&s;t link of a long chain of repetitions; every &s;ub&s;equent interference being naturally pro|duced by the effects of the preceding. They very
<PB N="71" REF="021127_0308_0FB24F66AD3856F8">
rightly infer, therefore, that &s;ome thorough reform is wanting which will bani&s;h &s;peculations on public mea&s;ures, in&s;pire a general prudence and indu&s;try, and give a regular cour&s;e to the bu&s;ine&s;s of &s;ociety. The prohibition with re&s;pect to titles of nobility, is copied from the articles of confederation and needs no comment.</P>

<Q>No &s;tate &s;hall, without the con&s;ent of the congre&s;s, lay any impo&s;ts or duties on imports or exports, except what may be ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for executing its in&s;pection laws, and the neat produce of all duties and impo&s;ts laid by any &s;tate on imports or exports, &s;hall be for the u&s;e of the trea&s;ury of the United States; and all &s;uch laws &s;hall be &s;ubject to the revi&s;ion and controul of the congre&s;s.

<P>The re&s;traint on the power of the &s;tates over imports and exports is enforced by all the arguments which prove the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;ubmitting the regulation of trade to the federal councils. It is needle&s;s there|fore to remark further on this head, than that the manner in which the re&s;traint is qualified, &s;eems well calculated at once to &s;ecure to the &s;tates a rea&s;onable di&s;cretion in providing for the conveniency of their imports and exports, and to the United States a rea&s;onable check again&s;t the abu&s;e of this di&s;cretion.

<Q>Of the&s;e the fir&s;t is the power to make all laws which &s;hall be nece&s;&s;ary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers, and all other powers ve&s;ted by this con&s;titution in the government of the United States.</Q></P>
<P>Few parts of the con&s;titution have been a&s;&s;ailed with more intemperance than this; yet on a fair inve&s;tigation of it, as has been el&s;ewhere &s;hewn, no part can appear more completely invulnerable. Without the <HI>&s;ub&s;tance</HI> of this power, the whole con|&s;titution would be a dead letter. Tho&s;e who object to the article therefore as a part of the con&s;titution, can only mean that the <HI>form</HI> of the provi&s;ion is improper. But have they con&s;idered whether a better form could have been &s;ub&s;tituted?</P>
<P>There are four other po&s;&s;ible methods which the convention might have taken on this &s;ubject. They might have copied the &s;econd article of the exi&s;ting confederation which would have prohibited the exer|ci&s;e of any power not <HI>expres&s;ly</HI> delegated; they might have attempted a po&s;itive enumeration of the powers comprehended under the general terms
<Q>nece&s;&s;ary and proper;</Q>
they might have attempted a negative enumeration of them, by &s;pecifying the powers excepted from the general definition: They might have been altogether &s;ilent on the &s;ubject; leaving the&s;e nece&s;&s;ary and proper powers, to con|&s;truction and inference.</P>
<P>Had the convention taken the fir&s;t method of adopting the &s;econd article of confederation; it is evident that the new congre&s;s would be continually expo&s;ed as their predece&s;&s;ors have been, to the alter|native of con&s;truing the term "<HI>expre&s;sly</HI>" with &s;o much rigour as to di&s;arm the government of all real authority whatever, or with &s;o much latitude as to de&s;troy altogether the force of the re&s;triction. It would be ea&s;y to &s;hew if it were nece&s;&s;ary, that no important power, delegated by the articles of con|federation, has been or can be executed by congre&s;s,

without recuring more or le&s;s to the doctrine of <HI>con&s;truction</HI> or <HI>implication.</HI> As the powers delegated under the new &s;y&s;tem are more exten&s;ive, the govern|ment which is to admini&s;ter it would find it&s;elf &s;till more di&s;tre&s;&s;ed with the alternative of betraying the public intere&s;t by doing nothing; or of violating the con&s;titution by exerci&s;ing powers indi&s;pen&s;ably ne|ce&s;&s;ary and proper; but at the &s;ame time, not <HI>expre&s;sly</HI> granted.</P>
<P>Had the convention attempted a po&s;itive enumera|tion of the powers nece&s;&s;ary and proper for carrying their other powers into effect&punc; the attempt would have involved a compleat dige&s;t of laws on every &s;ubject to which the con&s;titution relates; accomo|dated too not only to the exi&s;ting &s;tate of things, but to all the po&s;&s;ible changes which futurity may pro|duce: For in every new application of a general power, the <HI>particular powers,</HI> which are the means of attaining the <HI>object</HI> of the general power, mu&s;t always nece&s;&s;arily vary with that object; and be often properly varied whil&s;t the object remains the &s;ame.</P>
<P>Had they attempted to enumerate the particular powers or means, not nece&s;&s;ary or proper for carrying the general powers into execution, the ta&s;k would have been no le&s;s chimerical; and would have been liable to this further objection; that every defect in the enumeration, would have been equivalent to a po&s;itive grant of authority. If to avoid this con&s;e|quence they had attempted a partial enumeration of the exceptions and de&s;cribed the re&s;idue by the gene|ral terms, <HI>not nece&s;&s;ary or proper:</HI> It mu&s;t have hap|pened that the enumeration would comprehend a few of the excepted powers only; that the&s;e would be &s;uch as would be lea&s;t likely to be a&s;&s;umed or tolerated becau&s;e the enumeration would of cour&s;e &s;elect &s;uch as would be lea&s;t nece&s;&s;ary or proper, and that the unnece&s;&s;ary and improper powers included in the re&s;iduum, would be le&s;s forcibly excepted, than if no partial enumeration had been made.</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="021127_0311_0FB24F6D6B2E0420">Had the con&s;titution been &s;ilent on this head, there can be no doubt that all the particular powers, re|qui&s;ite as means of executing the general powers, would have re&s;ulted to the government, by unavoid|able implication. No axiom is more clearly e&s;ta|bli&s;hed in law, or in rea&s;on, than that wherever the end is required, the means are authori&s;ed; wherever a general power to do a thing is given, every parti|cular power nece&s;&s;ary for doing it, is included. Had this la&s;t method therefore been pur&s;ued by the con|vention, every objection now urged again&s;t their plan, would remain in all its plau&s;ibility; and the real inconveniency would be incurred, of not re|moving a pretext which may be &s;eized on critical occa&s;ions for drawing into que&s;tion the e&s;&s;ential powers of the union.</P>
<P>If it be a&s;ked, what is to be the con&s;equence, in ca&s;e the congre&s;s &s;hall mi&s;con&s;true this part of the con&s;titution, and exerci&s;e powers not warranted by its true meaning? I an&s;wer the &s;ame as if they &s;hould mi&s;con&s;true or enlarge any other power ve&s;ted in them, as if the general power had been reduced to parti|culars, and any one of the&s;e were to be violated; the &s;ame in &s;hort, as if the &s;tate legi&s;latures &s;hould vio|late their re&s;pective con&s;titutional authorities. In the fir&s;t in&s;tance, the &s;ucce&s;s of the u&s;urpation will depend on the executive and judiciary departments, which are to expound and give effect to the legi&s;lative acts; and in the la&s;t re&s;ort, a remedy mu&s;t be obtained from the people, who can by the election of more faithful re|pre&s;entatives, annul the acts of the u&s;urpers. The truth is, that this ultimate redre&s;s may be more con|fided in again&s;t uncon&s;titutional acts of the federal than of the &s;tate legi&s;latures, for this plain rea&s;on, that as every &s;uch act of the former, will be an inva|&s;ion of the rights of the latter, the&s;e will be ever ready to mark the innovation, to &s;ound the alarm to the peo|ple, and to exert their local influence in effecting a change of federal repre&s;entatives. There being no

&s;uch intermediate body between the &s;tate legi&s;latures and the people, intere&s;ted in watching the conduct of the former, violations of the &s;tate con&s;titution are more likely to remain unnoticed and unredre&s;&s;ed.</P>

<Q>This con&s;titution and the laws of the United States which &s;hall be made in pur&s;uance thereof, and all treaties made, or which &s;hall be made, un|der the authority of the United States, &s;hall be the &s;upreme law of the land, and the judges in every &s;tate &s;hall be bound thereby, any thing in the con&s;titution or laws of any &s;tate to the contrary notwith&s;tanding.</Q></P>
<P>The indi&s;creet zeal of the adver&s;aries to the con|&s;titution. has betrayed them into an attack on this part of it al&s;o, without which it would have been evidently and radically defective. To be fully &s;en|&s;ible of this we need only &s;uppo&s;e for a moment, that the &s;upremacy of the &s;tate con&s;titutions had been left compleat by a &s;aving clau&s;e in their favor.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, as the&s;e con&s;titutions inve&s;t the &s;tate legi&s;latures with ab&s;olute &s;overeignty, in all ca&s;es not excepted by the exi&s;ting articles of confe|deration, all the authorities contained in the propo&s;ed con&s;titution, &s;o far as they exceed tho&s;e enumerated in the confederation, would have been annulled, and the new congre&s;s would have been reduced to the &s;ame impotent condition with their predece&s;&s;ors.</P>
<P>In the next place, as the con&s;titutions of &s;ome of the &s;tates do not even expre&s;sly and fully recognize the exi&s;ting powers of the confederacy, an expre&s;s &s;aving of the &s;upremacy of the former, would in &s;uch &s;tates have brought into que&s;tion, every power con|tained in the propo&s;ed con&s;titution.</P>
<P>In the third place, as the con&s;titutions of the &s;tates differ much from each other, it might happen that a treaty or national law of great and equal import|ance to the &s;tates, would interfere with &s;ome and not with other con&s;titutions, and would con&s;equently be valid in &s;ome of the &s;tates at the &s;ame time that it would have no effect in others.</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="021127_0313_0FB24F702E63CB20">In fine, the world would have &s;een for the fir&s;t time, a &s;y&s;tem of government founded on an inver|&s;ion of the fundamental principles of all government; it would have &s;een the authority of the whole &s;ociety every where &s;ubordinate to the authority of the parts; it would have &s;een a mon&s;ter in which the head was under the direction of the members.</P>
<P N="3">3.
<Q>The &s;enators and repre&s;entatives, and the members of the &s;everal &s;tate legi&s;latures; and all executive and judicial officers, both of the United States, and the &s;everal &s;tates &s;hall be bound by oath or affirmation, to &s;upport this con&s;titution.</Q></P>
<P>It has been a&s;ked, why it was thought nece&s;&s;ary, that the &s;tate magi&s;tracy &s;hould be bound to &s;upport the federal con&s;titution, and unnece&s;&s;ary that a like oath &s;hould be impo&s;ed on the officers of the United States in favour of the &s;tate con&s;titutions?</P>
<P>Several rea&s;ons might be a&s;&s;igned for the di&s;tinc|tions. I content my&s;elf with one which is obvious and conclu&s;ive. The members of the federal govern|ment will have no agency in carrying the &s;tate con|&s;titutions into effect. The members and officers of the &s;tate governments, on the contrary, will have an e&s;&s;ential agency in giving effect to the federal con&s;titution. The election of the pre&s;ident and &s;e|nate, will depend in all ca&s;es, on the legi&s;latures of the &s;everal &s;tates. And the election of the hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives, will equally depend on the &s;ame authority in the fir&s;t in&s;tance; and will probably, for ever be conducted by the officers and according to the laws of the &s;tates.</P>
<P N="4">4. Among the provi&s;ions for giving efficacy to the federal powers, might be added, tho&s;e which belong to the executive and judiciary departments: But as the&s;e are re&s;erved for particular examination in another place, I pa&s;s them over in this.</P>
<P>We have now reviewed in detail all the articles compo&s;ing the &s;um or quantity of power delegated by the propo&s;ed con&s;titution to the federal government;

The que&s;tion therefore, whether this amount of power &s;hall be granted or not, re&s;olves it&s;elf into another que&s;tion, whether or not a government com|men&s;urate to the exigencies of the union, &s;hall be e&s;tabli&s;hed; or in other words, whether the union it&s;elf &s;hall be pre&s;erved.</P>

<HEAD>NUMBER XLV. A further Di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the &s;uppo&s;ed Danger from the Powers of the Union, to the State Governments.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING &s;hewn that no one of the powers tran&s;|fered to the federal government is unnece&s;&s;ary or improper, the next que&s;tion to be con&s;idered is whether the whole ma&s;s of them will be dangerous to the portion of authority left in the &s;everal &s;tates.</P>
<P>The adver&s;aries to the plan of the convention in|&s;tead of con&s;idering in the fir&s;t place what degree of power was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for the purpo&s;es of the federal government, have exhau&s;ted them&s;elves in a &s;econdary enquiry into the po&s;&s;ible con&s;equences of the propo&s;ed degree of power, to the governments of the particular &s;tates. But if the union, as has been &s;hewn, be e&s;&s;ential, to the &s;ecurity of the people of America again&s;t foreign danger; if it be e&s;&s;ential to their &s;ecurity again&s;t contentions and wars among the different &s;tates; if it be e&s;&s;ential to guard them again&s;t tho&s;e violent and oppre&s;&s;ive factions which imbitter the ble&s;&s;ings of liberty, and again&s;t tho&s;e military e&s;tabli&s;hments which mu&s;t gradually poi&s;on its very fountain; if, in a word the union be e&s;&s;ential
<PB N="78" REF="021127_0315_0FB24F739200A868">
to the happine&s;s of the people of America, is it not prepo&s;terous, to urge as an objection to a govern|ment without which the objects of the union cannot be attained, that &s;uch a government may derogate from the importance of the governments of the indi|vidual &s;tates? Was then the American revolution effected, was the American confederacy formed, was the precious blood of thou&s;ands &s;pilt, and the hard earned &s;ub&s;tance of millions lavi&s;hed, not that the people of America &s;hould enjoy peace, liberty, and &s;afety; but that the governments of the individual &s;tates, that particular municipal e&s;tabli&s;hments might enjoy a certain extent of power, and be arrayed with certain dignities and attributes of &s;overeignty? We have heard of the impious doctrine in the old world that the people were made for kings, not kings for the people. Is the &s;ame doctrine to be revived in the new, in another &s;hape, that the &s;olid happine&s;s of the people is to be &s;acrificed to the views of poli|tical in&s;titutions of a different form? It is too early for politicians to pre&s;ume on our forgetting that the public good, the real welfare of the great body of the people is the &s;upreme object to be pur&s;ued; and that no form of government whatever, has any other value, than as it may be fitted for the attainment of this object. Were the plan of the convention adver&s;e to the public happine&s;s, my voice would be, reject the plan. Were the union it&s;elf incon&s;i&s;tent with the public happine&s;s, it would be, aboli&s;h the union. In like manner as far as the &s;overeignty of the &s;tates cannot be reconciled to the happine&s;s of the people; the voice of every good citizen mu&s;t be, let the former be &s;acrificed to the latter. How far the &s;a|crifice is nece&s;&s;ary, has been &s;hewn. How far the un&s;acrificed re&s;idue will be endangered, is the que&s;|tion before us.</P>
<P>Several important con&s;iderations have been touch|ed in the cour&s;e of the&s;e papers, which di&s;countenance the &s;uppo&s;ition that the operation of the federal
<PB N="79" REF="021127_0316_0FB24F7A08091160">
government will by degrees prove fatal to the &s;tate governments. The more I revolve the &s;ubject the more fully I am per&s;uaded that the balance is much more likely to be di&s;turbed by the preponderancy of the la&s;t than of the fir&s;t &s;cale.</P>
<P>We have &s;een in all the examples of antient and modern confederacies, the &s;tronge&s;t tendency conti|nually betraying it&s;elf in the members to de&s;poil the general government of its authorities, with a very ineffectual capacity in the latter to defend it&s;elf a|gain&s;t the encroachments. Although in mo&s;t of the&s;e examples, the &s;y&s;tem has been &s;o di&s;&s;imilar from that under con&s;ideration, as greatly to weaken any in|ference concerning the latter from the fate of the former; yet as the &s;tates will retain under the pro|po&s;ed con&s;titution a very exten&s;ive portion of active &s;overeignty, the inference ought not to be wholly di&s;regarded. In the Achaean league, it is probable that the federal head had a degree and &s;pecies of power, which gave it a con&s;iderable likene&s;s to the government framed by the convention. The Lycian confederacy, as far as its principles and form are tran&s;mitted, mu&s;t have borne a &s;till greater analogy to it. Yet hi&s;tory does not inform us that either of them ever degenerated or tended to degenerate into one con&s;olidated government. On the contrary, we know that the ruin of one of them proceeded from the incapacity of the federal authority to prevent the di&s;&s;entions, and finally the di&s;union of the &s;ubordi|nate authorities. The&s;e ca&s;es are the more worthy of our attention, as the external cau&s;es by which the co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">onent parts were pre&s;&s;ed together, were much more numerous and powerful than in our ca&s;e; and con&s;equently, le&s;s powerful ligaments within, would be &s;ufficient to bind the members to the head, and to each other.</P>
<P>In the feudal &s;y&s;tem we have &s;een a &s;imilar pro|pen&s;ity exemplified. Notwith&s;tanding the want of proper &s;ympathy in every in&s;tance between the local
<PB N="80" REF="021127_0317_0FB24F7DAC6D8CE8">
&s;overeigns and the people, and the &s;ympathy in &s;ome in&s;tances between the general &s;overeign and the latter; it u&s;ually happened that the local &s;overeigns prevail|ed in the rival&s;hip for encroachments. Had no external dangers enforced internal harmony and &s;ubordination; and particularly had the local &s;ove|reigns po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the affections of the people, the great kingdoms in Europe, would at this time con&s;i&s;t of as many independent princes as there were formerly feudatory barons.</P>
<P>The &s;tate governments will have the advantage of the federal government, whether we compare them in re&s;pect to the immediate dependence of the one on the other; to the weight of per&s;onal influence which each &s;ide will po&s;&s;e&s;s; to the powers re&s;pectively ve&s;ted in them; to the predilection and probable &s;upport of the people; to the di&s;po&s;ition and faculty of re&s;i&s;ting and fru&s;trating the mea&s;ures of each other.</P>
<P>The &s;tate governments may be regarded as con|&s;tituent and e&s;&s;ential parts of the federal government; whil&s;t the latter is no wi&s;e e&s;&s;ential to the operation or organi&s;ation of the former. Without the inter|vention of the &s;tate legi&s;latures, the pre&s;ident of the United States cannot be elected at all. They mu&s;t in all ca&s;es have a great &s;hare in his appointment, and will perhaps in mo&s;t ca&s;es of them&s;elves deter|mine it. The &s;enate will be elected ab&s;olutely and exclu&s;ively by the &s;tate legi&s;latures. Even the hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives, though drawn immediately from the people, will be cho&s;en very much under the in|fluence of that cla&s;s of men, who&s;e influence over the people obtains for them&s;elves an election into the &s;tate legi&s;latures. Thus each of the principal branches of the federal government will owe its exi&s;tence more or le&s;s to the favor of the &s;tate governments, and mu&s;t con&s;equently feel a dependence, which is much more likely to beget a di&s;po&s;ition too ob&s;equious, than too overbearing towards them. On the other
<PB N="81" REF="021127_0318_0FB24F7E99E2C908">
&s;ide, the component parts of the &s;tate governments will in no in&s;tance be indebted for their appointment to the direct agency of the federal government, and very little if at all, to the local influence of its members.</P>
<P>The number of individuals employed under the con&s;titution of the United States, will be much &s;maller, than the number employed under the parti|cular &s;tates. There will con&s;equently be le&s;s of per&s;onal influence on the &s;ide of the former, than of the latter. The members of the legi&s;lative, executive and judiciary departments of thirteen and more &s;tates; the ju&s;tices of peace, officers of militia, mini&s;terial offi|cers of ju&s;tice, with all the county corporation and town officers, for three millions and more of people, in|termixed and having particular acquaintance with every cla&s;s and circle of people, mu&s;t exceed beyond all proportion, both in number and influence, tho&s;e of every de&s;cription who will be employed in the admini&s;tration of the federal &s;y&s;tem. Compare the members of the three great departments, of the Thirteen Sates, excluding from the judiciary depart|ment the ju&s;tices of peace, with the members of the corre&s;ponding departments of the &s;ingle government of the union; compare the militia officers of three millions of people, with the military and marine officers of any e&s;tabli&s;hment which is within the compa&s;s of probability, or I may add, of po&s;&s;ibility, and in this view alone, we may pronounce the ad|vantage of the &s;tates to be deci&s;ive. If the federal government is to have collectors of revenue, the &s;tate governments will have theirs al&s;o. And as tho&s;e of the former will be principally on the &s;ea-coa&s;t, and not very numerous; whil&s;t tho&s;e of the latter will be &s;pread over the face of the country, and will be very numerous, the advantage in this view al&s;o lies on the &s;ame &s;ide. It is true that the confederacy is to po&s;&s;e&s;s, and may exerci&s;e, the power of collecting internal as well as external taxes throughout the &s;tates:
<PB N="82" REF="021127_0319_0FB24F80017C18B0">
But it is probable that this power will not be re&s;orted to, except for &s;upplemental purpo&s;es of revenue; that an option will then be given to the &s;tates to &s;upply their quotas by previous collections of their own; and that the eventual collection under the immediate authority of the union, will generally be made by the officers, and according to the rules, appointed by the &s;everal &s;tates. Indeed it is extremely probable that in other in&s;tances, particularly in the organization of the judicial power, the officers of the &s;tates will be cloathed with the corre&s;pondent authority of the union. Should it happen however that &s;eparate collectors of internal revenue &s;hould be appointed under the fe|deral government, the influence of the whole number would not be a compari&s;on with that of the multitude of &s;tate-officers in the oppo&s;ite &s;cale. Within every di&s;trict, to which a federal collector would be allot|ted, there would not be le&s;s than thirty or forty or even more officers of different de&s;criptions and many of them per&s;ons of character and weight, who&s;e in|fluence would lie on the &s;ide of the &s;tate.</P>
<P>The powers delegated by the propo&s;ed con&s;titution to the federal government, are few and defined. Tho&s;e which are to remain in the &s;tate governments are numerous and indefinite. The former will be exerci&s;ed principally on external objects, as war, peace, negociation, and foreign commerce; with which la&s;t the power of taxation will for the mo&s;t part be connected. The powers re&s;erved to the &s;everal &s;tates will extend to all the objects, which, in the or|dinary cour&s;e of affairs, concern the lives, liberties and properties of the people; and the internal order, improvement and pro&s;perity of the &s;tate.</P>
<P>The operations of the federal government will be mo&s;t exten&s;ive and important in times of war and danger; tho&s;e of the &s;tate governments, in times of peace and &s;ecurity. As the former periods will pro|bably bear a &s;mall proportion to the latter, the &s;tate governments will here enjoy another advantage over
<PB N="83" REF="021127_0320_0FB24F818B4DEFA8">
the federal government. The more adequate indeed the federal powers may be rendered to the national defence, the le&s;s frequent will be tho&s;e &s;cenes of dan|ger which might favour their a&s;cendancy over the governments of the particular &s;tates.</P>
<P>If the new con&s;titution be examined with accuracy and candour, it will be found that the change which it propo&s;es, con&s;i&s;ts much le&s;s in the addition of NEW POWERS to the union, than in the invigoration of its ORIGINAL POWERS. The regulation of commerce, it is true, is a new power; but that &s;eems to be an addition which few oppo&s;e, and from which no appre|hen&s;ions are entertained. The powers relating to war and peace, armies and fleets, treaties and finance, with the other more con&s;iderable powers, are all ve&s;t|ed in the exi&s;ting congre&s;s by the articles of confe|deration. The propo&s;ed change does not enlarge the&s;e powers; it only &s;ub&s;titutes a more effectual mode of admini&s;tering them. The change relating to tax|ation, may be regarded as the mo&s;t important: and yet the pre&s;ent congre&s;s have as compleat authority to REQUIRE of the &s;tates indefinite &s;upplies of money for the common defence and general welfare, as the future congre&s;s will have to require them of indivi|dual citizens; and the latter will be no more bound than the &s;tates them&s;elves have been, to pay the quo|tas re&s;pectively taxed on them. Had the &s;tates com|plied punctually with the articles of confederation, or could their compliance have been enforced by as peaceable means as may be u&s;ed with &s;ucce&s;s towards &s;ingle per&s;ons, our pa&s;t experience is very far from countenancing an opinion that the &s;tate governments would have lo&s;t their con&s;titutional powers, and have gradually undergone an entire con&s;olidation. To maintain that &s;uch an event would have en&s;ued, would be to &s;ay at once, that the exi&s;tence of the &s;tate go|vernments is incompatible with any &s;y&s;tem whatever that accompli&s;hes the e&s;&s;ential purpo&s;es of the union.</P>

<P>RESUMING the &s;ubject of the la&s;t paper I pro|ceed to enquire whether the federal government or t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e &s;tate governments will have the advantage wit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">gard to the predilection and &s;upport of the people.

I a&s;&s;ume this po&s;ition here as it re&s;pects the fir&s;t, re&s;erving the proofs for another place. The federal and &s;tate of governments are in fact but different agents and tru&s;tees of the people, in&s;tituted with different powers, and de&s;ign|ated for different purpo&s;es.

The&s;e gentlemen mu&s;t here be reminded of their error. They mu&s;t be told that the ultimate authority, wherever the derivative may be found, re&s;ides in the people alone; and that it will not depend merely on the comparative ambi|tion or addre&s;s of the different governments, whether either, or which of them, will be able to enlarge its &s;phere of juri&s;diction at the expence of the other. Truth no le&s;s than decency requires, that the event in every ca&s;e &s;hould be &s;uppo&s;ed to depend on the &s;entiments and &s;anction of their common con&s;tituents.</P>
<P>Many con&s;iderations, be&s;ides tho&s;e &s;ugge&s;ted on a former occa&s;ion, &s;eem to place it beyond doubt, that
<PB N="85" REF="021127_0322_0FB24F85EE3EA750">
the fir&s;t and mo&s;t natural attachment of the people will be to the governments of their re&s;pective &s;tates. Into the admini&s;tration of the&s;e, a greater number of individuals will expect to ri&s;e. From the gift of the&s;e, a greater number of offices and emoluments will flow. By the &s;uperintending care of the&s;e, all the more dome&s;tic and per&s;onal intere&s;ts of the peo|ple will be regulated and provided for. With the affairs of the&s;e, the people will be more familiarly and minutely conver&s;ant. And with the members of the&s;e, will a greater proportion of the people <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ave the ties of per&s;onal acquaintance and friend&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and of family and party attachments; on the &s;ide of the&s;e, therefore, the popular bias may well be expected mo&s;t &s;trongly to incline.</P>
<P>Experience &s;peaks the &s;ame language in this ca&s;e. The federal admini&s;tration, though hitherto very defective, in compari&s;on with what may be hoped under a better &s;y&s;tem, had during the war, and particularly, whil&s;t the independent fund of paper emi&s;&s;ions was in credit, an activity and importance as great as it can well have, in any future circum|&s;tances whatever. It was engaged too in a cour&s;e of mea&s;ures, which had for their object, the protection of every thing that was dear, and the acqui&s;ition of every thing that could be de&s;irable to the people at large. It was neverthele&s;s, invariably found, after the tran&s;ient enthu&s;ia&s;m for the early congre&s;&s;es was over, that the attention and attachment of the people were turned anew to their own particular govern|ments; that the federal council was at no time the idol of popular favor; and that oppo&s;ition to propo|&s;ed enlargements of its powers and importance, was the &s;ide u&s;ually taken by the men who wi&s;hed to build their political con&s;equence on the prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of their fellow citizens.</P>
<P>If therefore, as has been el&s;ewhere remarked, the people &s;hould in future become more partial to the federal than to the &s;tate governments, the change can
<PB N="86" REF="021127_0323_0FB24F88CA8DE780">
only re&s;ult from &s;uch manife&s;t and irre&s;i&s;tible proofs of a better admini&s;tration, as will overcome all their antecedent propen&s;ities. And in that ca&s;e, the people ought not &s;urely to be precluded from giving mo&s;t of their confidence where they may di&s;cover it to be mo&s;t due: But even in that ca&s;e, the &s;tate governments could have little to apprehend, becau&s;e it is only within a certain &s;phere, that the federal power can, in the nature of things, be advantageou&s;ly admini&s;tered.</P>
<P>The remaining points on which I propo&s;ed to compare the federal and &s;tate governments, are the di&s;po&s;ition, and the faculty they may re&s;pectively po&s;&s;e&s;s, to re&s;i&s;t and fru&s;trate the mea&s;ures of each other.</P>
<P>It has been already proved, that the members of the federal will be more dependent on the members of the &s;tate governments, than the latter will be on the former. It has appeared al&s;o, that the prepo&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ions of the people on whom both will depend, will be more on the &s;ide of the &s;tate governments, than of the federal government. So far as the di&s;po&s;ition of each, towards the other, may be influ|enced by the&s;e cau&s;es, the &s;tate governments mu&s;t clearly have the advantage. But in a di&s;tinct and very important point of view, the advantage will lie on the &s;ame &s;ide. The prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions which the members them&s;elves will carry into the federal government, will generally be favorable to the &s;tates; whil&s;t it will rarely happen, that the mem|bers of the &s;tate governments will carry into the public councils, a bias in favor of the general government. A local &s;pirit will infallibly prevail much more in the members of the congre&s;s, than a national &s;pirit will prevail in the legi&s;latures of the particular &s;tates. Every one knows that a great proportion of the errors committed by the &s;tate legi&s;latures proceeds from the di&s;po&s;ition of the members to &s;acrifice the comprehen&s;ive and per|manent intere&s;ts of the &s;tate, to the particular and
<PB N="87" REF="021127_0324_0FB24F8C037E93B8">
&s;eparate views of the counties or di&s;tricts in which they re&s;ide. And if they do not &s;ufficiently enlarge their policy to embrace the collective welfare of their particular &s;tate, how can it be imagined, that they will make the aggregate pro&s;perity of the union, and the dignity and re&s;pectability of its government, the objects of their affections and con&s;ultations? For the &s;ame rea&s;on, that the members of the &s;tate legi&s;|latures will be unlikely to attach them&s;elves &s;uffici|ently to national objects, the members of the federal legi&s;lature will be likely to attach them&s;elves too much to local objects. The &s;tates will be to the latter, what counties and towns are to the former. Mea&s;ures will too often be decided according to their probable effect, not on the national pro&s;perity and happine&s;s, but on the prejudices, intere&s;ts and pur|&s;uits of the governments and people of the individual &s;tates. What is the &s;pirit that has in general cha|racterized the proceedings of congre&s;s? A peru&s;al of their journals as well as the candid acknowledg|ments of &s;uch as have had a &s;eat in that a&s;&s;embly, will inform us, that the members have but too frequently di&s;played the character, rather of partizans of their re&s;pective &s;tates, than of impartial guardians of a common intere&s;t; that where, on one occa&s;ion, im|proper &s;acrifices have been made of local con&s;ider|ations to the aggrandizement of the federal govern|ment; the great intere&s;ts of the nation have &s;uffered on an hundred, from an undue atttention to the local prejudices, intere&s;ts and views of the particular &s;tates. I mean not by the&s;e reflections to in&s;inuate, that the new federal government will not embrace a more enlarged plan of policy than the exi&s;ting government may have pur&s;ued, much le&s;s that its views will be as confined as tho&s;e of the &s;tate legi&s;|latures; but only that it will partake &s;ufficiently of the &s;pirit of both, to be di&s;inclined to invade the rights of the individual &s;tates, or the prerogatives of their governments. The motives on the part of the
<PB N="88" REF="021127_0325_0FB24F9669A967C0">
&s;tate governments, to augment their prerogatives by defalcations from the federal government, will be over-ruled by no reciprocal predi&s;po&s;itions in the members.</P>
<P>Were it admitted however that the federal govern|ment may feel an equal di&s;po&s;ition with the &s;tate governments to extend its power beyond the due limits, the latter would &s;till have the advantage in the means of defeating &s;uch encroachments. If an act of a particular &s;tate, though unfriendly to the national government, be generally popular in that &s;tate, and &s;hould not too gro&s;sly violate the oaths of the &s;tate officers, it is executed immediately, and of cour&s;e, by means on the &s;pot, and depending on the &s;tate alone. The oppo&s;ition of the federal govern|ment, or the interpo&s;ition of federal officers, would but inflame the zeal of all parties on the &s;ide of the &s;tate, and the evil could not be prevented or repaired, if at all, without the employment of means which mu&s;t always be re&s;orted to with reluctance and diffi|culty. On the other hand, &s;hould an unwarrantable mea&s;ure of the federal government be unpopular in particular &s;tates, which would &s;eldom fail to be the ca&s;e, or even a warrantable mea&s;ure be &s;o, which may &s;ometimes be the ca&s;e, the means of oppo&s;ition to it are powerful and at hand. The di&s;quietude of the people, their repugnance and perhaps refu&s;al to co-operate with the officers of the union, the frowns of the executive magi&s;tracy of the &s;tate, the embar|ra&s;&s;ments created by legi&s;lative devices, which would often be added on &s;uch occa&s;ions, would oppo&s;e in any &s;tate difficulties not to be de&s;pi&s;ed; would form in a large &s;tate very &s;erious impediments, and where the &s;entiments of &s;everal adjoining &s;tates happened to be in uni&s;on, would pre&s;ent ob&s;tructions which the federal government would hardly be willing to encounter.</P>
<P>But ambitious encroachments of the federal govern|ment, on the authority of the &s;tate governments, would
<PB N="89" REF="021127_0326_0FB24F97F2527240">
not excite the oppo&s;ition of a &s;ingle &s;tate or of a few &s;tates only. They would be &s;ignals of general alarm. Every government would e&s;pou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e the common cau&s;e. A corre&s;pondence would be opened. Plans of re&s;i&s;t|ance would be concerted.

But what degree of madne&s;s could ever drive the federal government to &s;uch an extremity? In the conte&s;t with Great-Britain, one part of the empire was employed again&s;t the other. The more nume<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ous part invaded the rights of the le&s;s numerous part. The attempt was unju&s;t and unwi&s;e; but it was not in &s;peculation ab&s;olutely chimerical. But what would be the conte&s;t in the ca&s;e we are &s;uppo&s;ing? Who would be the parties? A few repre&s;entatives of the people would be oppo&s;ed to the people them&s;elves; or rather one &s;et of repre&s;enta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ives would be contending again&s;t thirteen &s;ets of repre&s;entatives, with the whole body of their common con&s;tituents on the &s;ide of the latter.</P>
<P>The only refuge left for tho&s;e who prophecy the downfal of the &s;tate governments; is the vi&s;ionary &s;uppo&s;ition that the federal government may previou&s;ly accumulate a military force for the projects of ambi|tion. The rea&s;onings contained in the&s;e papers mu&s;t have been employed to little purpo&s;e indeed, if it could be nece&s;&s;ary now to di&s;prove the reality of this danger. That the people and the &s;tates &s;hould for a &s;ufficient period of time elect an uninterrupted &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of men ready to betray both; that the traitors &s;hould throughout this period, uniformly and &s;y&s;tematically pur&s;ue &s;ome fixed plan for the exten&s;ion of the mili|tary e&s;tabli&s;hment; that the governments and the people of the &s;tates &s;hould &s;ilently and patiently behold

the gathering &s;torm, and continue to &s;upply the mate|rials, until it &s;hould be prepared to bur&s;t on their own heads, mu&s;t appear to every one more like the inco|herent dreams of a delirious jealou&s;y, or the mi&s;|judged exaggerations of a counterfeit zeal, than like the &s;ober apprehen&s;ions of genuine patrioti&s;m. Extra|vagant as the &s;uppo&s;ition is, let it however be made. Let a regular army, fully equal to the re&s;ources of the country be formed; and let it be entirely at the devo|tion of the federal government; &s;till it would not be going too far to &s;ay, that the &s;tate governments with the people on their &s;ide would be able to repel the danger. The highe&s;t number to which, according to the be&s;t computation, a &s;tanding army can be carried in any country, does not exceed one hundredth part of the whole number of &s;ouls; or one twenty-fifth part of the number able to bear arms. This proportion would not yield in the United States an army of more than twenty-five or thirty thou&s;and men. To the&s;e would be oppo&s;ed a militia amount|ing to near half a million of citizens with arms in their hands, officered by men cho&s;en from among them&s;elves, fighting for their common liberties, and united and conducted by governments po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing their affections and confidence. It may well be doubted whether a militia thus circum&s;tanced could ever be conquered by &s;uch a proportion of regular troops. Tho&s;e who are be&s;t acquainted with the late &s;ucce&s;sful re&s;i&s;tance of this country again&s;t the Briti&s;h arms will be mo&s;t inclined to deny the po&s;&s;ibility of it. Be&s;ides the advantage of being armed, which the Americans po&s;&s;e&s;s over the people of almo&s;t every other nation, the exi&s;tence of &s;ubordinate governments to which the people are attached, and by which the militia officers are appointed, forms a barrier again&s;t the enterprizes of ambition, more in&s;urmountable than any which a &s;imple government of any form can admit of. Notwith&s;tanding the military e&s;tabli&s;h|ments in the &s;everal kingdoms of Europe, which are
<PB N="91" REF="021127_0328_0FB24F9BDEA2A6C0">
carried as far as the public re&s;ources will bear, the governments are afraid to tru&s;t the people with arms. And it is not certain that with this aid alone, they would not be able to &s;hake off their yokes. But were the people to po&s;&s;e&s;s the additional advantages of local governments cho&s;en by them&s;elves, who could collect the national will, and direct the national force, and of officers appointed out of the militia, by the&s;e govern|ments and attached both to them and to the militia, it may be affirmed with the greate&s;t a&s;&s;urance that the throne of every tyranny in Europe would be &s;peedily overturned, in &s;pite of the legions which &s;urround it. Let us not in&s;ult the free and gallant citizens of America with the &s;u&s;picion that they would be le&s;s able to defend the rights of which they would be in actual po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, than the deba&s;ed &s;ubjects of arbitrary power would be to re&s;cue theirs from the hands of their oppre&s;&s;ors. Let us rather no longer in&s;ult them with the &s;uppo&s;ition, that they can ever reduce them&s;elves to the nece&s;&s;ity of making the experiment, by a blind and tame &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the long train of in&s;idious mea&s;ures, which mu&s;t precede and produce it.</P>
<P>The argument under the pre&s;ent head may be put into a very conci&s;e form, which appears altogether conclu&s;ive. Either the mode in which the federal government is to be con&s;tructed will render it &s;uffici|ently dependant on the people, or it will not. On the fir&s;t &s;uppo&s;ition, it will be re&s;trained by that depen|dence from forming &s;chemes obnoxious to their con|&s;tituents. On the other &s;uppo&s;ition it will not po&s;&s;e&s;s the confidence of the people, and its &s;chemes of u&s;ur|pation will be ea&s;ily defeated by the &s;tate govern|ments; who will be &s;upported by the people.</P>
<P>On &s;umming up the con&s;iderations &s;tated in this and the la&s;t paper, they &s;eem to amount to the mo&s;t convincing evidence, that the powers propo&s;ed to be lodged in the federal government, are as little formi|dable to tho&s;e re&s;erved to the individual &s;tates, as they

<HEAD>NUMBER XLVII. The Meaning of the Maxim, which requires a Separation of the Departments of Power, examined and a&s;certained.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING reviewed the general form of the pro|po&s;ed government, and the general ma&s;s of power allotted to it; I proceed to examine the par|ticular &s;tructure of this government, and the di&s;tri|bution of this ma&s;s of power among its con&s;ti|tuent parts.</P>
<P>One of the principal objections inculcated by the more re&s;pectable adver&s;aries to the con&s;titution, is its &s;uppo&s;ed violation of the political maxim, that the legi&s;lative, executive and judiciary departments ought to be &s;eperate and di&s;tinct. In the &s;tructure of the federal government, no regard, it is &s;aid, &s;eems to have been paid to this e&s;&s;ential precaution in favor of liberty. The &s;everal departments of power are di&s;tr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">buted and blended in &s;uch a manner, as at once to de&s;troy all &s;ymmetry and beauty of form; and to expo&s;e &s;ome of the e&s;&s;ential parts of the edifice to the danger of being cru&s;hed by the di&s;proportionate weight of other parts.</P>
<P>No political truth is certainly of greater intrin&s;ic value or is &s;tamped with the authority of more enlightened patrons of liberty, than that on which the objection is founded. The accumulation of all
<PB N="93" REF="021127_0330_0FB24FA5B0271660">
powers legi&s;lative, executive and judiciary in the &s;ame hands, whether of one, a few or many, and whether hereditary, &s;elf appointed, or elective, may ju&s;tly be pronounced the very definition of tyranny. Were the federal con&s;titution therefore, really chargeable with this accumulation of power or with a mixture of powers, having a dangerous tendency to &s;uch an accumulation, no further arguments would be nece&s;&s;ary to in&s;pire a univer&s;al reprobation of the &s;y&s;tem. I per&s;uade my&s;elf however, that it will b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> made apparent to every one, that the charge cannot be &s;upported, and that the maxim on which it relies, has been totally mi&s;conceived and mi&s;ap|plied. In order to form correct ideas on this im|portant &s;ubject, it will be proper to inve&s;tigate the &s;en&s;e, in which the pre&s;ervation of liberty requires, that the three great departments of power &s;hould be &s;eparate and di&s;tinct.</P>
<P>The oracle who is always con&s;ulted and cited on this &s;ubject, is the celebrated Monte&s;quieu. If he be not the author of this invaluable precept in the &s;cience of politics, he has the merit at lea&s;t of di&s;|playing and recommending it mo&s;t effectually to the attention of mankind. Let us endeavour in the fir&s;t place to a&s;certain his meaning on this point.</P>
<P>The Briti&s;h con&s;titution was to Monte&s;queiu, what Homer has been to the didactic writers on epic poetry. As the latter have con&s;idered the work of the immortal bard, as the perfect model from which the principles and rules of the epic art were to be drawn, and by which all &s;imilar works were to be judged; &s;o this great political critic appears to have viewed the con&s;titution of England as the &s;tandard, or to u&s;e his own expre&s;&s;ion, as the mirror of poli|tical liberty; and to have delivered in the form of elementary truths, the &s;everal characteri&s;tic princi|ples of that particular &s;y&s;tem. That we may be &s;ure then not to mi&s;take his meaning in this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a&s;e,
<PB N="94" REF="021127_0331_0FB24FA713C7B880">
let us recur to the &s;ource from which the maxim was drawn.</P>
<P>On the &s;lighte&s;t view of the Briti&s;h con&s;titution we mu&s;t perceive, that the legi&s;lative, executive, and judiciary departments are by no means totally &s;eparate and di&s;tinct from each other. The execu|tive magi&s;trate forms an integral part of the legi&s;la|tive authority. He alone has the prerogative of making treaties with foreign &s;overeigns, which when made, have, under certain limitations, the force of legi&s;lative acts. All the member<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of the judiciary department are appointed by him; can be removed by him on the addre&s;s of the two hou&s;es of parliament, and form, when he plea&s;es to con&s;ult them, one of his con&s;titutional councils. One branch of the legi&s;lative department forms al&s;o, a great con&s;titutional council to the executive chief; as on another hand, it is the &s;ole depo&s;itary of judi|cial power in ca&s;es of impeachment, and is inve&s;ted with the &s;upreme appellate juri&s;diction, in all other ca&s;es. The judges again are &s;o far connected with the legi&s;lative department, as often to attend and participate in its deliberations, though not admitted to a legi&s;lative vote.</P>
<P>From the&s;e facts by which Monte&s;quieu was guided it may clearly be inferred, that in &s;aying,
<Q>there can be no liberty where the legi&s;lative and execu|tive powers are united in the &s;ame per&s;on, or body of magi&s;trates,</Q>
or,
<Q>if the power of judging be not &s;eparated from the legi&s;lative and executive powers,</Q>
he did not mean that the&s;e departments ought to have no <HI>partial agency</HI> in, or no <HI>control</HI> over the acts of each other. His meaning, as his own words import, and &s;till more conclu&s;ively as illu&s;trated by the example in his eye, can amount to no more than th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s, that where the <HI>whole</HI> power of one department is exerci&s;ed by the &s;ame hands which po&s;&s;e&s;s the <HI>whole</HI> power of another department, the fundamental principles of a free con&s;titution, are
<PB N="95" REF="021127_0332_0FB24FAA75F47060">
&s;ubverted. This would not have been the ca&s;e in the con&s;titution examined by him, if the king who is the &s;ole executive magi&s;trate, had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed al&s;o the complete legi&s;lative power, or the &s;upreme admini|&s;tration of ju&s;tice; or if the entire legi&s;lative body, had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the &s;upreme judiciary, or the &s;upreme executive authority. This however is not among the vices of that con&s;titution. The magi&s;trate in whom the whole executive power re&s;ides cannot of him&s;elf make a law, though he can put a negative on every law, nor admini&s;ter ju&s;tice in per&s;on, though he has the appointment of tho&s;e who do admini&s;ter it. The judges can exerci&s;e no executive prerogative, though they are &s;hoots from the executive &s;tock, nor any legi&s;|lative function, though they may be advi&s;ed with by the legi&s;lative councils. The entire legi&s;lature, can perform no judiciary act; though by the joint act of two of its branches, the judges may be removed from their offices; and though one of its branches is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the judicial power in the la&s;t re&s;ort. The entire legi&s;lature again can exerci&s;e no executive prerogative, though one of its branches<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The King.</NOTE> con&s;titutes the &s;upreme executive magi&s;tracy; and another, on the impeachment of a third, can try and condemn all the &s;ubordinate officers in the executive department.</P>
<P>The rea&s;ons on which Monte&s;quieu grounds his maxim are a further demon&s;tration of his meaning.
<Q>When the legi&s;lative and executive powers are united in the &s;ame per&s;on or body,
&s;ays he,
there can be no liberty, becau&s;e apprehen&s;ions may ari&s;e le&s;t <HI>the &s;ame</HI> monarch or &s;enate &s;hould <HI>enact</HI> tyran|nical laws, to <HI>execute</HI> them in a tyrannical manner.</Q>
Again
<Q>Were the power of judging joined with the legi&s;lative, the life and liberty of the &s;ubject would be expo&s;ed to arbitrary control, for <HI>the judge</HI> would then be <HI>the legi&s;lator.</HI> Were it joined to the exe|cutive power, <HI>the judge</HI> might behave with all the violence of <HI>an oppre&s;&s;or.</HI></Q>
Some of the&s;e rea&s;ons

are more fully explained in other pa&s;&s;ages; but briefly &s;tated as they are here, they &s;ufficiently e&s;tabli&s;h the meaning which we have put on this celebrated maxim of this celebrated author.</P>
<P>If we look into the con&s;titutions of the &s;everal &s;tates, we find that notwith&s;tanding the emphatical, and in &s;ome in&s;tances, the unqualified terms in which this axiom has been laid down, there is not a &s;ingle in&s;tance in which the &s;everal departments of power have been kept ab&s;olutely &s;eparate and di&s;tinct. New-Hamp&s;hire, who&s;e con&s;titution was the la&s;t formed, &s;eems to have been fully aware of the impo&s;|&s;ibility and inexpediency of avoiding any mixture whatever of the&s;e departments; and has qualified the doctrine by declaring
<Q><HI>that the legi&s;lative, execu|tive and judiciary powers ought to be kept as &s;eparate from, and independent of each other</HI> as the nature of a free government will admit; or as is con&s;i&s;tent with that chain of connection, that binds the whole fabric of the con&s;titution in one indi&s;&s;oluble bond of unity and amity.</Q>
Her con&s;titution ac|cordingly mixes the&s;e departments in &s;everal re&s;pects. The &s;enate, which is a branch of the legi&s;lative department, is al&s;o a judicial tribunal for the trial of impeachments. The pre&s;ident who is the head of the executive department, is the pre&s;iding member al&s;o of the &s;enate; and be&s;ides an equal vote in all ca&s;es, has a ca&s;ting vote in ca&s;e of a tie. The exe|cutive head is him&s;elf eventually elective every year by the legi&s;lative department; and his council is every year cho&s;en by and from the members of the &s;ame department. Several of the officers of &s;tate are al&s;o appointed by the legi&s;lature. And the members of the judiciary department are appointed by the executive department.</P>
<P>The con&s;titution of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts has ob&s;erved a &s;ufficient though le&s;s pointed caution in expre&s;&s;ing this fundamental article of liberty. It declares,
<Q>that the legi&s;lative department &s;hall never exerci&s;e the
<PB N="97" REF="021127_0334_0FB24FB4AC1A2558">
executive and judicial powers, or either of them: The executive &s;hall never exerci&s;e the legi&s;lative and judicial powers, or either of them: The judicial &s;hall never exerci&s;e the legi&s;lative and executive powers, or either of them.</Q>
This declaration corre&s;ponds preci&s;ely with the doctrine of Monte&s;quieu, as it has been explained, and is not in a &s;ingle point violated by the plan of the con|vention. It goes no farther than to prohibit any one of the entire departments from exerci&s;ing the powers of another department. In the very con|&s;titution to which it is prefixed, a partial mixture of powers has been admitted. The executive ma|gi&s;trate has a qualified negative on the legi&s;lative body; and the &s;enate, which is a part of the legi&s;|lature, is a court of impeachment for members both of the executive and judiciary departments. The members of the judiciary department again are appointable by the executive department, and re|moveable by the &s;ame authority, on the addre&s;s of the two legi&s;lative branches. La&s;tly, a number of the officers of government are annually appointed by the legi&s;lative department. As the appointment to offices, particularly executive offices, is in its nature an executive function, the compilers of the con&s;titution have in this la&s;t point at lea&s;t, violated the rule e&s;tabli&s;hed by them&s;elves.</P>
<P>I pa&s;s over the con&s;titution of Rhode-I&s;land and Connecticut, becau&s;e they were formed prior to the revolution; and even before the principle under ex|amination had become an object of political attention.</P>
<P>The con&s;titution of New-York contains no decla|ration on this &s;ubject; but appears very clearly to have been framed with an eye to the danger of im|properly blending the different departments. It gives neverthele&s;s to the executive magi&s;trate a partial controul over the legi&s;lative department; and what is more, gives a like controul to the judiciary department, and even blends the executive and
<PB N="98" REF="021127_0335_0FB24FB65DD37F80">
judiciary departments in the exerci&s;e of this controul. In its council of appointment, members of the le|gi&s;lative are a&s;&s;ociated with the executive authority in the appointment of officers both executive and judiciary. And its court for the trial of impeach|ments and correction of errors, is to con&s;i&s;t of one branch of the legi&s;lature and the principal members of the judiciary department.</P>
<P>The con&s;titution of New-Jer&s;ey has blended the different powers of government more than any of the preceding. The governor, who is the executive magi&s;trate, is appointed by the legi&s;lature; is chan|cellor and ordinary or &s;urrogate of the &s;tate; is a member of the &s;upreme court of appeals, and pre|&s;ident with a ca&s;ting vote, of one of the legi&s;lative branches. The &s;ame legi&s;lative branch acts again as executive council of the governor, and with him con&s;titutes the court of appeals. The members of the judiciary department are appointed by the legi&s;|lative department, and removeable by one branch of it, on the impeachment of the other.</P>
<P>According to the con&s;titution of Penn&s;ylvania, the pre&s;ident, who is head of the executive department, is annually elected by a vote in which the legi&s;la|tive department predominates. In conjunction with an executive council, he appoints the members of the judiciary department, and forms a court of impeachments for trial of all officers, judiciary as well as executive. The judges of the &s;upreme court, and ju&s;tices of the peace, &s;eem al&s;o to be removeable by the legi&s;lature; and the executive power of par|doning in certain ca&s;es to be referred to the &s;ame department. The members of the executive council are made EX OFFICIO ju&s;tices of peace throughout the &s;tate.</P>
<P>In Delaware, the chief executive magi&s;trate is annually elected by the legi&s;lative department. The &s;peakers of the two legi&s;lative branches are vice-pre&s;idents in the executive department. The
<PB N="99" REF="021127_0336_0FB24FBEE7E2B950">
executive chief, with &s;ix others, appointed three by each of the legi&s;lative branches, con&s;titute the &s;upreme court of appeals: He is joined with the legi&s;lative department in the appointment of the other judges. Throughout the &s;tates it appears that the members of the legi&s;lature may at the &s;ame time be ju&s;tices of the peace. In this &s;tate, the members of one branch of it are EX OFFICIO ju&s;tices of the peace; as are al&s;o the members of the executive council. The principal officers of the executive department are appointed by the legi&s;lative; and one branch of the latter forms a court of impeach|ments. All officers may be removed on addre&s;s of the legi&s;lature.</P>
<P>Maryland has adopted the maxim in the mo&s;t unqualified terms; declaring that the legi&s;lative, executive and judicial powers of government, ought to be forever &s;eparate and di&s;tinct from each other. Her con&s;titution, notwith&s;tanding makes the execu|tive magi&s;trate appointable by the legi&s;lative de|partment; and the members of the judiciary, by the executive department.</P>
<P>The language of Virginia is &s;till more pointed on this &s;ubject. Her con&s;titution declares,
<Q>that the legi&s;lative, executive and judiciary departments, &s;hall be &s;eparate and di&s;tinct; &s;o that neither exerci&s;e the powers properly belonging to the other; nor &s;hall any per&s;on exerci&s;e the powers of more than one of them at the &s;ame time; ex|cept that the ju&s;tices of county courts &s;hall be eligible to either hou&s;e of a&s;&s;embly.</Q>
Yet we find not only this expre&s;s exception, with re&s;pect to the members of the inferior courts; but that the chief magi&s;trate with his executive council are appoint|able by the legi&s;lature; that two members of the latter are triennially di&s;placed at the plea&s;ure of the legi&s;lature; and that all the principal officers, both executive and judiciary, are filled by the &s;ame de|partment. The executive prerogative of pardoning,
<PB N="100" REF="021127_0337_0FB24FCC54337E58">
al&s;o is in one ca&s;e ve&s;ted in the legi&s;lative depart|ment.</P>
<P>The con&s;titution of North-Carolina, which de|clares,
<Q>that the legi&s;lativ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, executive and &s;upreme judicial powers of gover<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ment, ought to be for|ever &s;eparate and di&s;tinct from each other,</Q>
refers at the &s;ame time to the legi&s;lative department, the appointment not only of the executive chief, but all the principal officers within both that and the judiciary department.</P>
<P>In South-Carolina, the con&s;titution makes the executive magi&s;tracy eligible by the legi&s;lative de|partment. It gives to the latter al&s;o the appointment of the members of the judiciary department, inclu|ding even ju&s;tices of the peace and &s;heriffs; and the appointment of officers in the executive department, down to captains in the army and navy of the &s;tate.</P>
<P>In the con&s;titution of Georgia, where it is de|clared,
<Q>that the legi&s;lative, executive and judici|ary departments &s;hall be &s;eparate and di&s;tinct, &s;o that neither exerci&s;e the powers properly belong|ing to the other.</Q>
We find that the executive department is to be filled by appointments of the legi&s;lature; and the executive prerogative of pardon|ing, to be finally exerci&s;ed by the &s;ame authority. Even ju&s;tices of the peace are to be appointed by the legi&s;lature.</P>
<P>In citing the&s;e ca&s;es in which the legi&s;lative, executive and judiciary departments have not been kept totally &s;eparate and di&s;tinct, I wi&s;h not to be regarded as an advocate for the particular organi|zations of the &s;everal &s;tate governments. I am fully aware that among the many excellent principles which they exemplify, they carry &s;trong marks of the ha&s;te, and &s;till &s;tronger of the inexperience, un|der which they were framed. It is but too obvious that in &s;ome in&s;tances, the fundamental principle under con&s;ideration has been violated by too great a mixture, and even an actual con&s;olidation of the
<PB N="101" REF="021127_0338_0FB24FD0ED547A18">
different powers; and that in no in&s;tance has a com|petent provi&s;ion been made for maintaining in prac|tice the &s;eparation delineated on paper. What I have wi&s;hed to evince is, that the charge brought again&s;t the propo&s;ed con&s;titution, of violating a &s;a|cred maxim of free government, is warranted neither by the real meaning annexed to that maxim by its author; nor by the &s;en&s;e in which it has hitherto been under&s;tood in America. This intere&s;ting &s;ub|ject will be re&s;umed in the en&s;uing paper.</P>

<HEAD>NUMBER LXVIII. The &s;ame Subject continued, with a View to the Means of giving Efficacy in Practice to that Maxim.</HEAD>
<P>IT was &s;hewn in the la&s;t paper, that the political apothegm there examined, does not require that the legi&s;lative, executive and judiciary departments &s;hould be wholly unconnected with each other. I &s;hall undertake in the next place, to &s;hew that unle&s;s the&s;e departments be &s;o far connected and blended, as to give to each a con&s;titutional controul over the others, the degree of &s;eparation which the maxim requires as e&s;&s;ential to a free government, can never in practice be duly maintained.</P>
<P>It is agreed on all &s;ides, that the powers properly belonging to one of the departments, ought not to be directly and compleatly admini&s;tered by either of the other departments. It is equally evident, that neither of them ought to po&s;&s;e&s;s directly or indirectly, an over-ruling influence over the others in the admini&s;tra|tion of their re&s;pective powers. It will not be denied that power is of an incroaching nature, and that it ought to be effectually re&s;trained from pa&s;&s;ing the
<PB N="102" REF="021127_0339_0FB24FD66E988B08">
limits, a&s;&s;igned to it. After di&s;criminating therefore in theory, the &s;everal cla&s;&s;es of power, as they may in their nature be legi&s;lative, executive or judiciary; the next and mo&s;t difficult ta&s;k, is to provide &s;ome practical &s;ecurity for each again&s;t the inva&s;ion of the others. What this &s;ecurity ought to be, is the great problem to be &s;olved.</P>
<P>Will it be &s;ufficient to mark with preci&s;ion the boundaries of the&s;e departments in the con&s;titution of the government, and to tru&s;t to the&s;e parchment barriers again&s;t the encroaching &s;pirit of power? This is the &s;ecurity which appears to have been princi|pally relied on by the compilers of mo&s;t of the Ame|rican con&s;titutions. But experience a&s;&s;ures us that the efficacy of the provi&s;ion has been greatly over|rated; and that &s;ome more adequate defence is in|di&s;pen&s;ibly nece&s;&s;ary for the more feeble, again&s;t the more powerful members of the government. The legi&s;lative department is every where extending the &s;phere of its activity, and drawing all power into its impetuous vortex.</P>
<P>The founders of our republics have &s;o much merit for the wi&s;dom which they have di&s;played, that no ta&s;k can be le&s;s plea&s;ing than that of pointing out the errors into which they have fallen. A re&s;pect for truth however obliges us to remark, that they &s;eem never for a moment to have turned their eyes from the danger to liberty from the overgrown and all-gra&s;ping prerogative of an hereditary magi&s;trate, &s;upported and fortified by an hereditary branch of the legi&s;lative authority. They &s;eem never to have re|collected the danger from legi&s;lative u&s;urpations, which by a&s;&s;embling all power in the &s;ame hands, mu&s;t lead to the &s;ame tyranny as is threatened by executive u&s;urpations.</P>
<P>In a government, where numerous and exten&s;ive prerogatives are placed in the hands of a hereditary monarch, the executive department is very ju&s;tly regarded as the &s;ource of danger, and watched with
<PB N="103" REF="021127_0340_0FB24FD996E78A68">
all the jealou&s;y which a zeal for liberty ought to in|&s;pire. In a democracy, where a multitude of people exerci&s;e in per&s;on the legi&s;lative functions, and are continually expo&s;ed by their incapacity for regular deliberation and concerted mea&s;ures, to the ambitious intrigues of their executive magi&s;trates, tyranny may well be apprehended on &s;ome favourable emergency, to &s;tart up in the &s;ame quarter. But in a repre&s;enta|tive republic, where the executive magi&s;tracy is carefully limited both in the extent and the duration of its power; and where the legi&s;lative power is ex|erci&s;ed by an a&s;&s;embly, which is in&s;pired by a &s;up|po&s;ed influence over the people with an intrepid con|fidence in its own &s;trength; which is &s;ufficiently nu|merous to feel all the pa&s;&s;ions which actuate a multi|tude; yet not &s;o numerous as to be incapable of pur&s;uing the objects of its pa&s;&s;ions, by means which rea&s;on pre&s;cribes; it is again&s;t the enterpri&s;ing ambi|tion of this department, that the people ought to indulge all their jealou&s;y and exhau&s;t all their precautions.</P>
<P>The legi&s;lative department derives a &s;uperiority in our governments from other circum&s;tances. Its con&s;titutional powers being at once more exten&s;ive and le&s;s &s;u&s;ceptible of preci&s;e limits, it can with the greater facility, ma&s;k under complicated and indi|rect mea&s;ures, the encroachments which it makes, on the co-ordinate departments. It is not unfre|quently a que&s;tion of real nicety in legi&s;lative bodies, whether the operation of a particular mea&s;ure, will, or will not extend beyond the legi&s;lative &s;phere. On the other &s;ide, the executive power being re&s;trained within a narrower compa&s;s, and being more &s;imple in its nature; and the judiciary being de&s;cribed by land marks, &s;till le&s;s uncertain, projects of u&s;urpation by either of the&s;e departments, would immediately betray and defeat them&s;elves. Nor is this all: As the legi&s;lative department alone has acce&s;s to the pockets of the people, and has in &s;ome con&s;titutions full di&s;cretion, and in all, a prevailing influence
<PB N="104" REF="021127_0341_0FB24FDD352C4A18">
over the pecuniary rewards of tho&s;e who fill the other departments, a dependence is thus created in the latter, which gives &s;till greater facility to encroach|ments of the former.</P>
<P>I have appealed to our own experience for the truth of what I advance on this &s;ubject. Were it nece&s;&s;ary to verify this experience by particular proofs, they might be multiplied without end. I might collect vouchers in abundance from the records and archives of every &s;tate in the union. But as a more conci&s;e and at the &s;ame time, equally &s;atisfac|tory evidence I will refer to the example of two &s;tates, atte&s;ted by two unexceptionable authorities.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t example is that of Virginia, a &s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">te which, as we have &s;een, has expre&s;sly declared in its con&s;ti|tution, that the three great departments ought not to be intermixed. The authority in &s;upport of it is Mr. Jeffer&s;on, who, be&s;ides his other advantages for re|marking the operation of the government, was him&s;elf the chief magi&s;trate of it. In order to convey fully the ideas with which his experience had impre&s;&s;ed him on this &s;ubject, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to quote a pa&s;&s;age of &s;ome length from his very intere&s;ting
"Notes on the &s;tate of Virginia."
(p. 195)
<Q>All the powers of government, legi&s;lative, executive and judi|ciary, re&s;ult to the legi&s;lative body. The concen|trating the&s;e in the &s;ame hands is preci&s;ely the definition of de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">potic government. It will be no alleviation that the&s;e powers will be exerci&s;ed by a plurality of hands, and not by a &s;ingle one. One hundred and &s;eventy-three de&s;pots would &s;urely be as oppre&s;&s;ive as one. Let tho&s;e who doubt it turn their eyes on the republic of Venice. As little will it avail us that they are cho&s;en by our&s;elves. An <HI>elective de&s;poti&s;m</HI> was not the go|vernment we fought for; but one which &s;hould not only be founded on free principles, but in which the powers of government &s;hould be &s;o divided and balanced among &s;everal bodies of magi&s;tracy, as that no one could tran&s;cend their
<PB N="105" REF="021127_0342_0FB24FDF302BD538">
legal limits, without being effectually checked and re&s;trained by the others. For this rea&s;on, that convention which pa&s;&s;ed the ordinance of go|vernment laid its foundation on this ba&s;is, that the legi&s;lative, executive and judiciary depart|ments, &s;hould be &s;eparate and di&s;tinct, &s;o that no per&s;on &s;hould exerci&s;e the powers of more than one of them at the &s;ame time. <HI>But no barrier was provided between the&s;e &s;everal powers.</HI> The judi|ciary and executive members were left dependent on the legi&s;lative for their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence in office, and &s;ome of them for their continuance in it. If therefore the legi&s;lature a&s;&s;umes executive and ju|diciary powers, no oppo&s;ition is likely to be made; nor if made can be effectual; becau&s;e in that ca&s;e, they may put their proceeding into the form of an act of a&s;&s;embly, which will rend<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> them obliga|tory on the other branches. They have accord|ingly <HI>in many</HI> in&s;tances <HI>decided rights</HI> which &s;hould have been left to <HI>judiciary controver&s;y</HI>; and <HI>the direction of the executive, during the whole time of their &s;e&s;&s;ion, is becoming habitual and familiar.</HI></Q></P>
<P>The other &s;tate which I &s;hall have for an example, is Penn&s;ylvania; and the other authority the council of cen&s;ors which a&s;&s;embled in the years 1783 and 1784. A part of the duty of this body, as marked out by the con&s;titution, was
<Q>to enquire whether the con&s;ti|tution had been pre&s;erved inviolate in every part; and whether the legi&s;lative and executive branches of government had performed their duty as guar|dians of the people, or a&s;&s;umed to them&s;elves, or exerci&s;ed other or greater powers than they are entitled to by the con&s;titution.</Q>
In the execution of this tru&s;t, the council were nece&s;&s;arily led to a compari&s;on, of both the legi&s;lative and executive proceedings, with the con&s;titutional powers of the&s;e departments; and from the facts enumerated, and to the truth of mo&s;t of which, both &s;ides in the coun|cil &s;ub&s;cribed, it appears that the con&s;titution had
<PB N="106" REF="021127_0343_0FB24FE1EE8220C0">
been flagrantly violated by the legi&s;lature in a variety of important in&s;tances.</P>
<P>A great number of laws had been pa&s;&s;ed violating without any apparent nece&s;&s;ity, the rule requiring that all bills of a publick nature &s;hall be previou&s;ly printed for the con&s;ideration of the people; although this is one of the precautions chiefly relied on by the con&s;titution, again&s;t improper acts of the legi&s;lature.</P>
<P>The con&s;titutional trial by jury had been violated; and powers a&s;&s;umed, which had not been delegated by the con&s;titution.</P>
<P>Executive powers had been u&s;urped.</P>
<P>The &s;alaries of the judges, which the con&s;titution expre&s;sly requires to be fixed, had been occa&s;ionally varied; and ca&s;es belonging to the judiciary depart|ment, frequently drawn within legi&s;lative cognizance and determination.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who wi&s;h to &s;ee the &s;everal particulars fall|ing under each of the&s;e heads, may con&s;ult the jour|nals of the council which are in print. Some of them, it will be found may be imputable to peculiar cir|cum&s;tances connected with the war: But the greater part of them may be con&s;idered as the &s;pontaneous &s;hoots of an ill con&s;tituted government.</P>
<P>It appears al&s;o, that the executive department had not been innocent of frequent breaches of the con&s;ti|tution. There are three ob&s;ervations however, which ought to be made on this head. <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> A great pro|portion of the in&s;tances, were either immediately produced by the nece&s;&s;ities of the war, or recommen|ded by Congre&s;s or the commander in chief. <HI>Second.</HI> In mo&s;t of the other in&s;tances, they conformed either to the declared or the known &s;entiments of the legi&s;lative department. <HI>Third.</HI> The executive de|partment of Penn&s;ylvania is di&s;tingui&s;hed from that of the other &s;tates, by the number of members com|po&s;ing it. In this re&s;pect it has as much affinity to a legi&s;lative a&s;&s;embly, as to an executive council. And being at once exempt from the re&s;traint of an
<PB N="107" REF="021127_0344_0FB24FE2F97B8F98">
individual re&s;pon&s;ibility for the acts of the body, and deriving confidence from mutual example and joint influence; unauthori&s;ed mea&s;ures would of cour&s;e be more freely hazarded, than where the executive de|partment is admini&s;tered by a &s;ingle hand or by a few hands.</P>
<P>The conclu&s;ion which I am warranted in drawing from the&s;e ob&s;ervations is, that a mere demarkation on parchment of the con&s;titutional limits of the &s;eve|ral departments, is not a &s;ufficient guard again&s;t tho&s;e encroachments which lead to a tyrannical con|centration of all the powers of government in the &s;ame hands.</P>

<P>THE author of the
"Notes on the &s;tate of Virgi|nia,"
quoted in the la&s;t paper has &s;ubjoined to that valuable work, the draught of a con&s;titution which had been prepared in order to be laid before a convention expected to be called in 1783, by the legi&s;lature, for the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a con&s;titution for that commonwealth. The plan, like every thing from the &s;ame pen, marks a turn of thinking original, comprehen&s;ive and accurate; and is the more worthy of attention, as it equally di&s;plays a fervent attach|ment to republican government, and an enlightened view of the dangerous propen&s;ities again&s;t which it ought to be guarded. One of the precautions which he propo&s;es, and on which he appears ultimately to rely as a palladium to the weaker departments of power, again&s;t the inva&s;ions of the &s;tronger, is per|haps altogether his own, and as it immediately re|lates to the &s;ubject of our pre&s;ent enquiry, ought not to be overlooked.</P>
<P><PB N="108" REF="021127_0345_0FB24FE538D9F868">His propo&s;ition is,
<Q>that whenever any two of the three branches of government &s;hall concur in opinion, each by the voices of two thirds of their whole number, that a convention is nece&s;&s;ary for altering the con&s;titution or <HI>correcting breaches of it,</HI> a convention &s;hall be called for the purpo&s;e.</Q></P>
<P>As the people are the only legitimate fountain of power, and it is from them that the con&s;titutional charter, under which the &s;everal branches of govern|ment hold their power, is derived; it &s;eems &s;trictly con&s;onant to the republican theory, to recur to the &s;ame original authority, not only whenever it may be nece&s;&s;ary to enlarge, dimini&s;h, or new-model the powers of government; but al&s;o whenever any one of the departments may commit encroachments on the chartered authorities of the others. The &s;everal departments being perfectly co-ordinate by the terms of their common commi&s;&s;ion, neither of them, it is evident, can pretend to an exclu&s;ive or &s;uperior right of &s;ettling the boundaries between their re&s;pective powers; and how are the encroachments of the &s;tronger to be prevented, or the wrongs of the weaker to be redre&s;&s;ed, without an appeal to the people them&s;elves; who, as the grantors of the commi&s;&s;ion, can alone declare its true meaning and enforce its ob&s;ervance?</P>
<P>There is certainly great force in this rea&s;oning, and it mu&s;t be allowed to prove, that a con&s;titutional road to the deci&s;ion of the people, ought to be mark|ed out, and kept open, for certain great and extraordinary occa&s;ions. But there appear to be in&s;uperable objections again&s;t the propo&s;ed recurrence to the people, as a provi&s;ion in all ca&s;es for keeping the &s;everal departments of power within their con|&s;titutional limits.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, the provi&s;ion does not reach the ca&s;e of a combination of two of the departments again&s;t a third. If the legi&s;lative authority, which po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es &s;o many means of operating on the motives
<PB N="109" REF="021127_0346_0FB24FE9C370A168">
of the other departments, &s;hould be able to gain to its intere&s;t either of the others, or even one third of its members, the remaining department could derive no advantage from this remedial provi&s;ion. I do not dwell however, on this objection, becau&s;e it may be thought to lie rather again&s;t the modification of the principle, than again&s;t the principle it&s;elf.</P>
<P>In the next place, it may be con&s;idered as an objection inherent in the principle, that as every appeal to the people would carry an implication of &s;ome defect in the government, frequent appeals would in great mea&s;ure deprive the government of that veneration which time be&s;tows on every thing, and without which perhaps the wi&s;e&s;t and free&s;t governments would not po&s;&s;e&s;s the requi&s;ite &s;tability. If it be true that all governments re&s;t on opinion, it is no le&s;s true that the &s;trength of opinion in each individual, and its practical influence on his conduct, depend much on the number which be &s;uppo&s;es to have entertained the &s;ame opinion. The rea&s;on of man, like man him&s;elf, is timid and cautious, when left alone; and acquires firmne&s;s and confidence, in proportion to the number with which it is a&s;&s;ociated. When the examples, which fortify opinion, are <HI>antient</HI> as well as <HI>numerous,</HI> they are known to have a dou|ble effect. In a nation of philo&s;ophers, this con&s;i|deration ought to be di&s;regarded. A reverence for the laws, would be &s;ufficiently inculcated by the voice of an enlightened rea&s;on. But a nation of philo&s;ophers is as little to be expected as the philo&s;o|phical race of kings wi&s;hed for by Plato. And in every other nation, the mo&s;t rational government will not find it a &s;uperfluous advantage to have the prejudices of the community on its &s;ide.</P>
<P>The danger of di&s;turbing the public tranquility by intere&s;ting too &s;trongly the public pa&s;&s;ions, is a &s;till more &s;erious objection again&s;t a frequent reference of con&s;titutional que&s;tions, to the deci&s;ion of the whole &s;ociety. Notwith&s;tanding the &s;ucce&s;s which
<PB N="110" REF="021127_0347_0FB24FEBF0A85450">
has attended the revi&s;ions of our e&s;tabli&s;hed forms of government, and which does &s;o much honor to the virtue and intelligence of the people of America, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that the experiments are of too tickli&s;h a nature to be unnece&s;&s;arily multiplied. We are to recollect that all the exi&s;ting con&s;titutions were formed in the mid&s;t of a danger which repre&s;&s;ed the pa&s;&s;ions mo&s;t unfriendly to order and concord; of an enthu&s;ia&s;tic confidence of the people in their patriotic leaders, which &s;tifled the ordinary diver&s;ity of opinions on great national que&s;tions; of a univer|&s;al ardor for new and oppo&s;ite forms, produced by a univer&s;al re&s;entment and indignation again&s;t the antient government; and whil&s;t no &s;pirit of party, connected with the changes to be made, or the abu&s;es to be reformed, could mingle its leaven in the operation. The future &s;ituations in which we mu&s;t expect to be u&s;ually placed, do not pre&s;ent any equivalent &s;ecurity again&s;t the danger which is apprehended.</P>
<P>But the greate&s;t objection of all is that the deci&s;ions which would probably re&s;ult from &s;uch appeals, would not an&s;wer the purpo&s;e of maintaining the con&s;titu|tional equilibrium of the government. We have &s;een that the tendency of republican governments is to an aggrandizement of the legi&s;lative, at the expence of the other departments. The appeals to the people therefore, would u&s;ually be made by the executive and judiciary departments. But whether made by one &s;ide or the other, would each &s;ide enjoy equal advantages on the trial? Let us view their different &s;ituations. The members of the executive and judi|ciary departments, are few in number, and can be per&s;onally known to a &s;mall part only of the people. The latter by the mode of their appointment, as well as by the nature and permanency of it, are too far removed from the people to &s;hare much in their prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions. The former are generally the ob|jects of jealou&s;y: and their admi&s;tration is always
<PB N="111" REF="021127_0348_0FB24FED7A261BC0">
liable to be di&s;coloured and rendered unpopular. The members of the legi&s;lative department, on the other hand, are numerous. They are di&s;tributed and dwell among the people at large. Their con|nections of blood, of friend&s;hip and of acquaintance, embrace a great proportion of the mo&s;t influential part of the &s;ociety. The nature of their public tru&s;t implies a per&s;onal influence among the people, and that they are more immediately the confidential guardians of the rights and liberties of the people. With the&s;e advantages, it can hardly be &s;uppo&s;ed that the adver&s;e party would have an equal chance for a favorable i&s;&s;ue.</P>
<P>But the legi&s;lative party would not only be able to plead their cau&s;e mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sfully with the people: They would probably be con&s;tituted them&s;elves the judges. The &s;ame influence which had gained them an election into the legi&s;lature, would gain them a &s;eat in the convention. If this &s;hould not be the ca&s;e with all, it would probably be the ca&s;e with many, and pretty certainly with tho&s;e leading cha|racters, on whom every thing depends in &s;uch bodies. The convention in &s;hort would be compo&s;ed chiefly of men, who had been, who actually were, or who expected to be, members of the department who&s;e conduct was arraigned. They would con&s;equently be parties to the very que&s;tion to be decided by them.</P>
<P>It might however &s;ometimes happen, that appeals would be made under circum&s;tances le&s;s adver&s;e to the executive and judiciary departments. The u&s;ur|pations of the legi&s;lature might be &s;o flagrant and &s;o &s;udden, as to admit of no &s;pecious colouring A &s;trong party among them&s;elves might take &s;ide with the other branches. The executive power might be in the hands of a peculiar favorite of the people. In &s;uch a po&s;ture of things, the public deci&s;ion might be le&s;s &s;wayed by prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in favor of the legi&s;|lative party. But &s;till it could never be expected to turn on the true merits of the que&s;tion. It would
<PB N="112" REF="021127_0349_0FB24FF004392570">
inevitably be connected with the &s;pirit of pre-exi&s;t|ing parties, or of parties &s;pringing out of the que&s;tion it&s;elf. It would be connected with per&s;ons of di&s;tin|gui&s;hed character and exten&s;ive influence in the com|munity. It would be pronounced by the very men who had been agents in, or opponents of the mea&s;ures, to which the deci&s;ion would relate. The <HI>pa&s;&s;ions</HI> therefore not the <HI>rea&s;on,</HI> of the public, would &s;it in judgment. But it is the rea&s;on of the public alone that ought to controul and regulate the government. The pa&s;&s;ions ought to be controuled and regulated by the government.</P>
<P>We found in the la&s;t paper that mere declarations in the written con&s;titution, are not &s;ufficient to re&s;train the &s;everal departments within their legal limits. It appears in this that occa&s;ional appeals to the people would be neither a proper nor an effectual provi&s;ion, for that purpo&s;e. How far the provi&s;ions of a different nature contained in the plan above quoted, might be adequate, I do not examine. Some of them are unque&s;tionably founded on &s;ound political principles, and all of them are framed with &s;ingular ingenuity and preci&s;ion.</P>

<P>IT may be contended perhaps, that in&s;tead of <HI>occa|&s;ional</HI> appeals to the people, which are liable to the objections urged again&s;t them, <HI>periodical</HI> appeals are the proper and adequate means of <HI>preventing and correcting infractions of the con&s;titution.</HI></P>
<P>It will be attended to, that in the examination of the&s;e expedients, I confine my&s;elf to their aptitude
<PB N="113" REF="021127_0350_0FB24FF12E192D90">
for <HI>enforcing</HI> the con&s;titution by keeping the &s;everal departments of power within their due bounds, without particularly con&s;idering them, as provi&s;ions for <HI>altering</HI> the con&s;titution it&s;elf. In the fir&s;t view, appeals to the people at fixed periods, appear to be nearly as ineligible, as appeals on particular occa|&s;ions as they emerge. If the periods be &s;eparated by &s;hort intervals, the mea&s;ures to be reviewed and recti|fied, will have been of recent date, and will be connected with all the circum&s;tances which tend to viciate and pervert the re&s;ult of occa&s;ional revi&s;ions. If the periods be di&s;tant from each other, the &s;ame remark will be applicable to all recent mea&s;ures, and in proportion as the remotene&s;s of the others may favor a di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate review of them, this advantage is in&s;eparable from inconveniences which &s;eem to counterbalance it. In the fir&s;t place, a di&s;tant pro|&s;pect of public cen&s;ure would be a very feeble re&s;traint on power from tho&s;e exce&s;&s;es, to which it might be urged by the force of pre&s;ent motives. Is it to be imagined, that a legi&s;lative a&s;&s;embly, con&s;i&s;ting of a hundred or two hundred members, eagerly bent on &s;ome favorite object, and breaking through the re&s;traints of the con&s;titution in pur&s;uit of it, would be arre&s;ted in their career, by con&s;iderations drawn from a cen&s;orial revi&s;ion of their conduct at the future di&s;tance of ten, fifteen or twenty years? In the next place, the abu&s;es would often have completed their mi&s;chievous effects, before the remedial provi&s;ion would be applied. And in the la&s;t place, where this might not be the ca&s;e, they would be of long &s;tanding would have taken deep root, and would not ea&s;ily be extirpated.</P>
<P>The &s;cheme of revi&s;ing the con&s;titution in order to correct recent breaches of it, as well as for other purpo&s;es, has been actually tried in one of the &s;tates. One of the objects of the council of cen&s;ors, which met in Penn&s;ylvania, in 1783 and 1784, was, as we have &s;een, to enquire
<Q>whether the con&s;titution had
<PB N="114" REF="021127_0351_0FB24FFA6E2ADCE8">
been violated, and whether the legi&s;lative and exe|cutive departments had encroached on each other.</Q>
This important and novel experiment in politics, merits in &s;everal points of view, very particular attention. In &s;ome of them it may perhaps as a &s;ingle experiment, made under circum&s;tances &s;ome|what peculiar, be thought to be not ab&s;olutely con|clu&s;ive. But as applied to the ca&s;e under con&s;idera|tion, it involves &s;ome facts which I venture to remark, as a complete and &s;atisfactory illu&s;tration of the rea|&s;oning which I have employed.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t.</HI> It appears from the names of the gentlemen who compo&s;ed the council, that &s;ome at lea&s;t of its mo&s;t active and leading members, had al&s;o been active and leading characters in the parties which pre-exi&s;ted in the &s;tate.</P>
<P><HI>Second.</HI> It appears that the &s;ame active and lead|ing members of the council, had been active and influential members of the legi&s;lative and executive branches, within the period to be reviewed; and even patrons or opponents of the very mea&s;ures to be thus brought to the te&s;t of the con&s;titution. Two of the members had been vice-pre&s;idents of the &s;tate, and &s;everal others, members of the executive council within the &s;even preceding years. One of them had been &s;peaker, and a number of others di&s;tingui&s;hed members of the legi&s;lative a&s;&s;embly, within the &s;ame period.</P>
<P><HI>Third.</HI> Every page of their proceedings witne&s;&s;es the effect of all the&s;e circum&s;tances on the temper of of their deliberations. Throughout the continuance of the council, it was &s;plit into two fixed and violent parties. The fact is acknowledged and lamented by them&s;elves. Had this not been the ca&s;e, the face of their proceedings exhibit a proof equally &s;atisfactory. In all que&s;tions, however unimportant in them&s;elves, or unconnected with each other, the &s;ame names &s;tand invariably contra&s;ted on the oppo&s;ite columns. Every unbia&s;&s;ed ob&s;erver, may infer without danger
<PB N="115" REF="021127_0352_0FB24FFE1C129D70">
of mi&s;take, and at the &s;ame time, without meaning to reflect on either party, or any individuals of either party, that unfortunately <HI>pa&s;&s;ion,</HI> not <HI>rea&s;on,</HI> mu&s;t have pre&s;ided over their deci&s;ions. When men exer|ci&s;e their rea&s;on coolly and freely, on a variety of di&s;tinct que&s;tions, they inevitably fall into different opinions on &s;ome of them. When they are governed by a common pa&s;&s;ion, their opinions, if they are &s;o to be called, will be the &s;ame.</P>
<P><HI>Fourth.</HI> It is at lea&s;t problematical, whether the deci&s;ions of this body do not, in &s;everal in&s;tances, mi&s;con&s;true the limits pre&s;cribed for the legi&s;lative and executive departments, in&s;tead of reducing and limiting them within their con&s;titutional places.</P>
<P><HI>Fifth.</HI> I have never under&s;tood that the deci&s;ions of the council on con&s;titutional que&s;tions, whether rightly or erroneou&s;ly formed, have had any effect in varying the practice founded on legi&s;lative con|&s;tructions. It even appears, if I mi&s;take not, that in one in&s;tance, the cotemporary legi&s;lature denied the con&s;tructions of the council, and actually prevailed in the conte&s;t.</P>
<P>This cen&s;orial body, therefore, proves at the &s;ame time, by its re&s;earches, the exi&s;tence of the di&s;ea&s;e; and by its example, the inefficacy of the remedy.</P>
<P>This conclu&s;ion cannot be invalidated by alledg|ing that the &s;tate in which the experiment was made, was at that cri&s;is, and had been for a long time before, violently heated and di&s;tracted by the rage of party. Is it to be pre&s;umed, that at any future &s;eptennial epoch, the &s;ame &s;tate will be free from parties? Is it to be pre&s;umed that any other &s;tate, at the &s;ame or any other given period, will be exempt from them? Such an event ought to be neither pre|&s;umed nor de&s;ired; becau&s;e an extinction of parties nece&s;&s;arily implies either a univer&s;al alarm for the public &s;afety, or an ab&s;olute extinction of liberty.</P>
<P>Were the precaution taken of excluding from the a&s;&s;emblies elected by the people to revi&s;e the pre|ceding
<PB N="116" REF="021127_0353_0FB250015DADD6E0">
admini&s;tration of the government, all per&s;ons who &s;hould have been concerned in the government within the given period, the difficulties would not be obviated. The important ta&s;k would probably devolve on men, who with inferior capacities, would in other re&s;pects be little better qualified. Although they might not have been per&s;onally concerned in the admini&s;tration, and therefore not immediately agents in the mea&s;ures to be examined; they would pro|bably have been involved in the parties connected with the&s;e mea&s;ures, and have been elected under their au&s;pices.</P>

<P>TO what expedient then &s;hall we finally re&s;ort for maintaining in practice the nece&s;&s;ary par|tition of power among the &s;everal departments, as laid down in the con&s;titution? The only an&s;wer that can be given is, that as all the&s;e exterior provi|&s;ions are found to be inadequate, the defect mu&s;t be &s;upplied, by &s;o contriving the interior &s;tructure of the government, as that its &s;everal con&s;tituent parts may, by their mutual relations, be the means of keeping each other in their proper places. Without pre&s;uming to undertake a full developement of this important idea, I will hazard a few general ob&s;er|vations, which may perhaps place it in a clearer light, and enable us to form a more correct judgment of the principles and &s;tructure of the government planned by the convention.</P>
<P>In order to lay a due foundation for that &s;eparate and di&s;tinct exerci&s;e of the different powers of govern|ment, which to a certain extent, is admitted on all
<PB N="117" REF="021127_0354_0FB2500282B8BF30">
hands to be e&s;&s;ential to the pre&s;ervation of liberty, it is evident that each department &s;hould have a will of its own; and con&s;equently &s;hould be &s;o con&s;tituted that the members of each &s;hould have as little agency as po&s;&s;ible in the appointment of the members of the others. Were this principle rigorou&s;ly adhered to, it would require that all the appointments for the &s;upreme executive, legi&s;lative and judiciary magi&s;tracies &s;hould be drawn from the &s;ame fountain of authority, the people, through channels, having no communication whatever with one another. Per|haps &s;uch a plan of con&s;tructing the &s;everal depart|ments would be le&s;s difficult in practice than it may in contemplation appear. Some difficulties however, and &s;ome additional expence, would attend the exe|cution of it. Some deviations therefore from the principle mu&s;t be admitted. In the con&s;titution of the judiciary department in particular, it might be inexpedient to in&s;i&s;t rigorou&s;ly on the principle; fir&s;t, becau&s;e peculiar qualifications being e&s;&s;ential in the members, the primary con&s;ideration ought to be to &s;elect that mode of choice, which be&s;t &s;ecures the&s;e qualifications; &s;econdly, becau&s;e the permanent tenure by which the appointments are held in that depart|ment, mu&s;t &s;oon de&s;troy all &s;en&s;e of dependence on the authority conferring them.</P>
<P>It is equally evident that the members of each department &s;hould be as little dependent as po&s;&s;ible on tho&s;e of the others, for the emoluments annexed to their offices. Were the executive magi&s;trate, or the judges, not independent of the legi&s;lature in this particular, their independence in every other, would be merely nominal.</P>
<P>But the great &s;ecurity again&s;t a gradual concentra|tion of the &s;everal powers in the &s;ame department, con&s;i&s;ts in giving to tho&s;e who admini&s;ter each depart|ment, the nece&s;&s;ary con&s;titutional means, and per&s;o|nal motives, to re&s;i&s;t encroachments of the others. The provi&s;ion for defence mu&s;t in this, as in all
<PB N="118" REF="021127_0355_0FB25004C9F95070">
other ca&s;es, be made commen&s;urate to the danger of attack. Ambition mu&s;t be made to counteract ambi|tion. The intere&s;t of the man mu&s;t be connected with the con&s;titutional rights of the place. It may be a reflection on human nature, that &s;uch devices &s;hould be nece&s;&s;ary to control the abu&s;es of govern|ment. But what is government it&s;elf but the greate&s;t of all reflections on human nature? If men were angels, no government would be nece&s;&s;ary. If angels were to govern men, neither external nor internal controls on government would be nece&s;&s;ary. In framing a government which is to be admini&s;tered by men over men, the great difficulty lies in this: You mu&s;t fir&s;t enable the government to control the governed; and in the next place, oblige it to con|trol it&s;elf. A dependence on the people is no doubt the primary control on the government; but expe|rience has taught mankind the nece&s;&s;ity of auxiliary precautions.</P>
<P>This policy of &s;upplying by oppo&s;ite and rival intere&s;ts, the defect of better motives, might be traced through the whole &s;y&s;tem of human affairs, private as well as public. We &s;ee it particularly di&s;played in all the &s;ubordinate di&s;tributions of power; where the con&s;tant aim is to divide and arrange the &s;everal offices in &s;uch a manner as that each may be a check on the other; that the private intere&s;t of every individual, may be a centinel over the public rights. The&s;e inventions of prudence cannot be le&s;s requi&s;ite in the di&s;tribution of the &s;upreme powers of the &s;tate.</P>
<P>But it is not po&s;&s;ible to give to each department an equal power of &s;elf-defence. In republican govern|ment the legi&s;lative authority nece&s;&s;arily predomi|nates. The remedy for this inconveniency is, to divide the legi&s;lature into different branches; and to render them by different modes of election, and different principles of action, as little connected with each other, as the nature of their common
<PB N="119" REF="021127_0356_0FB25006FA7539A8">
functions, and their common dependence on the &s;ociety, will admit. It may even be nece&s;&s;ary to guard again&s;t dangerous encroachments by &s;till fur|ther precautions. As the weight of the legi&s;lative authority requires that it &s;hould be thus divided, the weakne&s;s of the executive may require, on the other hand, that it &s;hould be fortified. An ab&s;olute negative, on the legi&s;lature, appears at fir&s;t view to be the natural defence with which the executive magi&s;trate &s;hould be armed. But perhaps it would be neither altogether &s;afe, nor alone &s;ufficient. On ordinary occa&s;ions, it might not be exerted with the requi&s;ite firmne&s;s; and on extraordinary occa&s;ions, it might be perfidiou&s;ly abu&s;ed. May not this defect of an ab&s;olute negative be &s;upplied by &s;ome qualified connection between this weaker department, and the weaker branch of the &s;tronger department, by which the latter may be led to &s;upport the con&s;titu|tional rights of the former, without being too much detached from the rights of its own department?</P>
<P>If the principles on which the&s;e ob&s;ervations are founded be ju&s;t, as I per&s;uade my&s;elf they are, and they be applied as a criterion to the &s;everal &s;tate con&s;titutions, and to the federal con&s;titution, it will be found, that if the latter does not perfectly corre&s;|pond with them, the former are infinitely le&s;s able to bear &s;uch a te&s;t.</P>
<P>There are moreover two con&s;iderations particu|larly applicable to the federal &s;y&s;tem of America, which place that &s;y&s;tem in a very intere&s;ting point of view.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t.</HI> In a &s;ingle republic, all the power &s;urren|dered by the people, is &s;ubmitted to the admini&s;tra|tion of a &s;ingle government; and the u&s;urpations are guarded again&s;t by a divi&s;ion of the government into di&s;tinct and &s;eparate departments. In the compound republic of America, the power &s;urrendered by the people, is fir&s;t divided between two di&s;tinct govern|ments, and then the portion allotted to each,
<PB N="120" REF="021127_0357_0FB250098F3C6FB8">
&s;ubdivided among di&s;tinct and &s;eparate departments. Hence a double &s;ecurity ari&s;es to the rights of the people. The different governments will control each other; at the &s;ame time that each will be controled by it&s;elf.</P>
<P><HI>Second.</HI> It is of great importance in a republic, not only to guard the &s;ociety again&s;t the oppre&s;&s;ion of its rulers; but to guard one part of the &s;ociety again&s;t the inju&s;tice of the other part. Different intere&s;ts nece&s;&s;arily exi&s;t in different cla&s;&s;es of citizens. If a majority be united by a common intere&s;t, the rights of the minority will be in&s;ecure. There are but two methods of providing again&s;t this evil: The one by creating a will in the community independent of the majority, that is, of the &s;ociety it&s;elf; the other by comprehending in the &s;ociety &s;o many &s;eparate de&s;crip|tions of citizens, as will render an unju&s;t combination of a majority of the whole very improbable, if not impracticable. The fir&s;t method prevails in all governments po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing an hereditary or &s;elf appointed authority. This at be&s;t is but a precarious &s;ecurity; becau&s;e a power independent of the &s;ociety may as well e&s;pou&s;e the unju&s;t views of the major, as the rightful intere&s;ts of the minor party, and may po&s;&s;ibly be turned again&s;t both parties. The &s;econd method will be exemplified in the federal republic of the United States. Whil&s;t all authority in it will be derived from, and dependent on the &s;ociety, the &s;ociety it&s;elf will be broken into &s;o many parts, intere&s;ts and cla&s;&s;es of citizens, that the rights of individuals or of the minority, will be in little danger from intere&s;ted combinations of the majority. In a free government, the &s;ecurity for civil rights mu&s;t be the &s;ame as that for religious rights. It con&s;i&s;ts in the one ca&s;e in the multiplicity of intere&s;ts, and in the other, in the multiplicity of &s;ects. The degree of &s;ecurity in both ca&s;es will depend on the number of intere&s;ts and &s;ects; and this may be pre&s;umed to depend on the extent of country and number of people

comprehended under the &s;ame government. This view of the &s;ubject mu&s;t particularly recommend a proper federal &s;y&s;tem to all the &s;incere and con&s;iderate friends of republican government: Since it &s;hews that in exact proportion as the territory of the union may be formed into more circum&s;cribed confederacies or &s;tates, oppre&s;&s;ive com<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">inations of a majority will be facilitated, the be&s;t &s;ecurity under the republican form, for the rights of every cla&s;s of citizens, will be dimini&s;hed; and con&s;equently, the &s;tability and independence of &s;ome member of the government, the only other &s;ecurity mu&s;t be proportionally increa&s;ed. Ju&s;tice is the end of government. It is the end of civil &s;ociety. I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> ever has been, and ever will be pur&s;ued, until it be obtained, or until liberty be lo&s;t in the pur&s;uit. In a &s;ociety under the forms of which the &s;tronger faction can readily unite and oppre&s;s the weaker, anarchy may as truly be &s;aid to reign, as in a &s;tate of nature where the weaker indi|vidual is not &s;ecured again&s;t the violence of the &s;tronger: And as in the latter &s;tate even the &s;tronger individuals are prompted by the uncertainty of their condition, to &s;ubmit to a government which may protect the weak as well as them&s;elves: So in the former &s;tate, will the more powerful factions or parties be gradually induced by a like motive, to wi&s;h for a government which will protect all parties, the weaker as well as the more powerful. It can be little doubted, that if the &s;tate of Rhode-I&s;land was &s;eparated from the confederacy, and left to it&s;elf, the in&s;ecurity of rights under the popular form of government within &s;uch narrow limits, would be di&s;played by &s;uch rei|terated oppre&s;&s;ions of factious majorities, that &s;ome power altogether independent of the people would &s;oon be called for by the voice of the very factions who&s;e mi&s;rule had proved the nece&s;&s;ity of it. In the extended republic of the United States, and among the great variety of intere&s;ts, parties and &s;ects which it embraces, a coalition of a majority of the whole

&s;ociety could &s;eldom take place upon any other prin|ciples than tho&s;e of ju&s;tice and the general good: Whil&s;t there being thus le&s;s danger to a minor from the will of the major party, there mu&s;t be le&s;s pretext al&s;o, to provide for the &s;ecurity of the former, by intro|ducing into the government <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> will not dependent on the latter; or in other words, a will independent of the &s;ociety it&s;elf.

<HEAD>NUMBER LII. Concerning the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives, with a View to the Qualifications of the Electors and elected, and the Time of Service of the Members.</HEAD>
<P>FROM the more general enquiries pur&s;ued in the four la&s;t papers, I pa&s;s on to a more particular examination of the &s;everal parts of the government. I &s;hall begin with the hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t view to be taken of this part of the government, relates to the qualifications of the elec|tors and the elected. Tho&s;e of the former are to be the &s;ame with tho&s;e of the electors of the mo&s;t numerous branch of the &s;tate legi&s;latures. The defi|nition of the right of &s;uffrage is very ju&s;tly regarded as a fundamental article of republican government.
<PB N="123" REF="021127_0360_0FB2500F0B67D878">
It was incumbent on the convention, therefore, to define and e&s;tabli&s;h this right in the con&s;titution. To have left it open for the occa&s;ional regulation of the congre&s;s, would have been improper for the rea&s;on ju&s;t mentioned. To have &s;ubmitted it to the legi&s;lative di&s;cretion of the &s;tates, would have been improper for the &s;ame rea&s;on; and for the additional rea&s;on, that it would have rendered too dependent on the &s;tate governments, that branch of the federal government, which ought to be dependent on the people alone. To have reduced the different quali|fications in the different &s;tates to one uniform rule, would probably have been as di&s;&s;atisfactory to &s;ome of the &s;tates, as it would have been difficult to the convention. The provi&s;ion ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e by the convention appears therefore, to be the be&s;t that lay within their option. It mu&s;t be &s;atisfactory to every &s;tate; be|cau&s;e it is conformable to the &s;tandard already e&s;tabli&s;hed, or which may be e&s;tabli&s;hed by the &s;tate it&s;elf. It will be &s;afe to the United States; becau&s;e, being fixed by the &s;tate con&s;titutions, it is not alter|able by the &s;tate governments, and it cannot be feared that the people of the &s;tates will alter this part of their con&s;titutions, in &s;uch a manner as to abridge the rights &s;ecured to them by the federal con&s;titution.</P>
<P>The qualifications of the elected being le&s;s care|fully and properly defined by the &s;tate con&s;titutions, and being at the &s;ame time more &s;u&s;ceptible of uni|formity, have been very properly con&s;idered and regulated by the convention. A repre&s;entative of the United States mu&s;t be of the age of twenty-five years; mu&s;t have been &s;even years a citizen of the United States; mu&s;t at the time of his election, be an inhabitant of the &s;tate he is to repre&s;ent, and during the time of his &s;ervice mu&s;t be in no office under the United States. Under the&s;e rea&s;onable limitations, the door of this part of the federal government is open to merit of every de&s;cription,
<PB N="124" REF="021127_0361_0FB2501008D8C158">
whether native or adoptive, whether young or old, and without regard to poverty or wealth, or to any particular profe&s;&s;ion of religious faith&punc;</P>
<P>The term for which the repre&s;entatives are to be elected, falls under a &s;econd view which may be taken of this branch. In order to decide on the propriety of this article, two que&s;tions mu&s;t be con&s;idered; fir&s;t, whether biennial elections will, in this ca&s;e, be &s;afe; &s;econdly, whether they be nece&s;&s;ary or u&s;eful.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t.</HI> As it is e&s;&s;ential to liberty, that the govern|ment in general &s;hould have a common intere&s;t with the people; &s;o it is particularly e&s;&s;ential that the branch of it under con&s;ideration &s;hould have an immediate dependence on, and an intimate &s;ympa|thy with the people. Frequent elections are unque&s;|tionably the only policy by which this dependence and &s;ympathy can be effectually &s;ecured. But what particular degree of frequency may be ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for the purpo&s;e, does not appear to be &s;u&s;|ceptible of any preci&s;e calculation: And mu&s;t depend on a variety of circum&s;tances with which it may be connected. Let us con&s;ult experience, the guide that ought always to be followed, whenever it can be found.</P>
<P>The &s;cheme of repre&s;entation, as a &s;ub&s;titute for a meeting of the citizens in per&s;on, being at mo&s;t but very imperfectly known to antient polity; it is in more modern times only, that we are to expect in&s;truc|tive examples. And even here, in order to avoid a re&s;earch too vague and diffu&s;ive, it will be proper to confine our&s;elves to the few examples which are be&s;t known, and which bear the greate&s;t analogy to our particular ca&s;e. The fir&s;t to which this cha|racter ought to be applied, is the hou&s;e of commons in Great-Britain. The hi&s;tory of this branch of the Engli&s;h con&s;titution, anterior to the date of Magna Charta, is too ob&s;cure to yield in&s;truction. The very exi&s;tence of it has been made a que&s;tion among poli|tical antiquaries. The earlie&s;t records of &s;ub&s;equent
<PB N="125" REF="021127_0362_0FB25014B3B13720">
date prove, that parliaments were to <HI>&s;it</HI> only, every year; not that they were to be <HI>elected</HI> every year. And even the&s;e annual &s;e&s;&s;ions were left &s;o much at the di&s;cretion of the monarch, that under various pretex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">, very long and dangerous intermi&s;&s;ions were often contrived by royal ambition. To remedy this grievance, it was provided by a &s;tatute in the reign of Charles IId. that the intermi&s;&s;ions, &s;hould not be protracted beyond a period of three years. On the acce&s;&s;ion of William IIId, when a revolution took place in the government, the &s;ubject was &s;till more &s;eriou&s;ly re&s;umed, and it was declared to be among the fundamental rights of the people, that parliaments ought to be held <HI>frequently.</HI> By another &s;tatute which pa&s;&s;ed a few years later in the &s;ame reign, the term "frequently" which had alluded to the triennial period &s;ettled in the time of Charles IId. is reduced to a preci&s;e meaning, it being expre&s;sly enacted that a new parliament &s;hall be called within three years after the determination of the former. The la&s;t change from three to &s;even years is well known to have been introduced pretty early in the pre&s;ent century, under an alarm for the Hanoverian &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. From the&s;e facts it appears, that the greate&s;t fre|quency of elections which has been deemed nece&s;&s;ary in that kingdom, for binding the repre&s;entatives to their con&s;tituents, does not exceed a triennial return of them. And if we may argue from the degree of liberty retained even under &s;eptennial elections, and all the other vicious ingredients in the parliamentary con&s;titution, we cannot doubt that a reduction of the period from &s;even to three years, with the other nece&s;&s;ary reforms, would &s;o far extend the influence of the people over their repre&s;entatives as to &s;atisfy us, that biennial elections under the federal &s;y&s;tem, cannot po&s;&s;ibly be dangerous to the requi&s;ite deqendence of the hou&s;e of repre&s;en|tatives on their con&s;tituents.</P>
<P><PB N="126" REF="021127_0363_0FB250176FCDE658">Elections in Ireland, till of late, were regulated entirely by the di&s;cretion of the crown, and were &s;eldom repeated except on the acce&s;&s;ion of a new prince, or &s;ome other contingent event. The parlia|ment which commenced with George IId&punc; was conti|nued throughout his whole reign, a period of about thirty-five years. The only dependence of the repre|&s;entatives on the people, con&s;i&s;ted in the right of the latter to &s;upply occa&s;ional vacancies, by the election of new members, and in the chance of &s;ome event which might produce a general new election. The ability al&s;o of the Iri&s;h parliament to maintain the rights of their con&s;tituents, &s;o far as the di&s;po&s;ition might exi&s;t, was extremely &s;hackled by the control of the crown over the &s;ubjects of their deliberation. Of late the&s;e &s;hackles, if I mi&s;take not, have been broken; and octennial parliaments have be&s;ides been e&s;tabli&s;hed. What effect may be produced by this partial reform, mu&s;t be left to further expe|rience. The example of Ireland, from this view of it, can throw but little light on the &s;ubject. As far as we can draw any conclu&s;ion from it, it mu&s;t be, that if the people of that country have been able, under all the&s;e di&s;advantages, to retain any liberty whatever, the advantage of biennial elections would &s;ecure to them every degree of liberty which might depend on a due connection between their repre&s;en|tatives and them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Let us bring our enquiries nearer home. The example of the&s;e &s;tates when Briti&s;h colonies, claims particular attention; at the &s;ame time that it is &s;o well known, as to require little to be &s;aid on it. The principle of repre&s;entation, in one branch of the legi&s;lature at lea&s;t, was e&s;tabli&s;hed in all of them. But the periods of election were different. They varied from one to &s;even years. Have we any rea&s;on to infer from the &s;pirit and conduct of the repre&s;enta|tives of the people, prior to the revolution, that biennial elections would have been dangerous to the
<PB N="127" REF="021127_0364_0FB2501AE61592A0">
public liberties? The &s;pirit which every where di&s;|played it&s;elf at the commencement of the &s;truggle; and which vanqui&s;hed the ob&s;tacles to independence, is the be&s;t of proofs that a &s;ufficient portion of liberty had been every where enjoyed to in&s;pire both a &s;en&s;e of its worth, and a zeal for its proper enlarge|ment. This remark holds good as well with regard to the then colonies, who&s;e elections were lea&s;t frequent, as to tho&s;e who&s;e elections were mo&s;t frequent. Virginia was the colony which &s;tood fir&s;t in re&s;i&s;ting the parliamentary u&s;urpations of Great-Britain; it was the fir&s;t al&s;o in e&s;pou&s;ing by public act, the re&s;olution of independence. In Virginia, neverthele&s;s, if I have not been mi&s;informed, elec|tions under the former government were &s;eptennial. This particular example is brought into view, not as a proof of any peculiar merit, for the priority in tho&s;e in&s;tances, was probably accidental; and &s;till le&s;s of any advantage in <HI>&s;eptennial</HI> elections, for when com|pared with a greater frequency they are inadmi&s;&s;ible; but merely as a proof, and I conceive it to be a very &s;ub&s;tantial proof, that the liberties of the people can be in no danger from <HI>biennial</HI> elections.</P>
<P>The conclu&s;ion re&s;ulting from the&s;e examples will be not a little &s;trengthened by recollecting three cir|cum&s;tances. The fir&s;t is, that the federal legi&s;lature will po&s;&s;e&s;s a part only of that &s;upreme legi&s;lative authority which is ve&s;ted completely in the Briti&s;h parliament, and which, with a few exceptions, was exerci&s;ed by the colonial a&s;&s;emblies and the Iri&s;h legi&s;lature. It is a received and well founded maxim, that, where no other circum&s;tances affect the ca&s;e, the greater the power is, the &s;horter ought to be its duration; and conver&s;ely, the &s;maller the power, the more &s;afely may its duration be protracted. In the &s;econd place, it has, on another occa|&s;ion, been &s;hewn that the federal legi&s;lature will not only be re&s;trained by its dependence on the people, as other legi&s;lative bodies are; but that it
<PB N="128" REF="021127_0365_0FB25021B70F0050">
will be moreover watched and controled by the &s;eve|ral collateral legi&s;latures, which other legi&s;lative bodies are not. And in the third place, no compa|ri&s;on can be made between the means that will be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the more permanent branches of the federal government for &s;educing, if they &s;hould be di&s;po&s;ed to &s;educe, the hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives from their duty to the people; and the means of influence over the popular branch, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the other branches of the governments above cited. With le&s;s power therefore to abu&s;e, the federal repre&s;entatives can be le&s;s tempted on one &s;ide, and will be doubly watched on the other.</P>

<P>I SHALL here perhaps be reminded of a current ob&s;ervation,
<Q>that where annual elections end, tyranny begins.</Q>
If it be true, as has often been remarked, that &s;ayings which become proverbial, are generally founded in rea&s;on, it is not le&s;s true that when once e&s;tabli&s;hed, they are often applied to ca&s;es to which the rea&s;on of them does not extend. I need not look for a proof beyond the ca&s;e before us. What is the rea&s;on on which this proverbial ob&s;erva|tion is founded? No man will &s;ubject him&s;elf to the ridicule of pretending that any natural connection &s;ub&s;i&s;ts between the &s;un or the &s;ea&s;ons, and the period within which human virtue can bear the temptations of power. Happily for mankind, liberty is not in this re&s;pect confined to any &s;ingle point of time; but lies within extremes, which afford &s;ufficient latitude for all the variations which may be required by the
<PB N="129" REF="021127_0366_0FB250277B52EB90">
various &s;ituations and circum&s;tances of civil &s;ociety, The election of magi&s;trates might be, if it were found expedient, as in &s;ome in&s;tances it actually has been, daily, weekly, or monthly&punc; as well as annual; and if circum&s;tances may require a deviation from the rule on one &s;ide, why not al&s;o on the other &s;ide. Turning our attention to the periods e&s;tabli&s;hed among our&s;elves, for the election of the mo&s;t nume|rous branches of the &s;tate legi&s;latures, we find them by no means coinciding any more in this in&s;tance, than in the elections of other civil magi&s;trates. In Connecticut and Rhode-I&s;land, the periods are half-yearly. In the other &s;tates, South-Carolina excepted, they are annual. In South-Carolina, they are bien|nial; as is propo&s;ed in the federal government. Here is a difference, as four to one, between the longe&s;t and the &s;horte&s;t periods; and yet it would be not ea&s;y to &s;hew that Connecticut or Rhode-I&s;land is better governed, or enjoys a greater &s;hare of rati|onal liberty than South-Carolina; or that either the one or the other of the&s;e &s;tates are di&s;tingui&s;hed in the&s;e re&s;pects, and by the&s;e cau&s;es, from the &s;tates who&s;e elections are different from both.</P>
<P>In &s;earching for the grounds of this doctrine. I can di&s;cover but one, and that is wholly inapplicable to our ca&s;e. The important di&s;tinction &s;o well under|&s;tood in America between a con&s;titution e&s;tabli&s;hed by the people, and unalterable by the government; and a law e&s;tabli&s;hed by the government, and alterable by the government, &s;eems to have been little under&s;tood and le&s;s ob&s;erved in any other country. Wherever the &s;upreme power of legi&s;lation has re&s;ided, has been &s;uppo&s;ed to re&s;ide al&s;o, a full power to change the form of the government. Even in Great Britain, where the principles of political and civil liberty have been mo&s;t di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, and where we hear mo&s;t of the rights of the con&s;titution, it is maintained that the authority of the parliament is tran&s;cendent and uncontrolable, as well with regard to the con&s;titution, as the ordinary objects
<PB N="130" REF="021127_0367_0FB2502ADE8F6510">
of legi&s;lative provi&s;ion. They have accordingly, in &s;everal in&s;tances, actually changed, by legi&s;lative acts, &s;ome of the mo&s;t fundamental articles of the govern|ment. They have in particular, on &s;everal occa&s;ions, changed the period of election; and on the la&s;t occa|&s;ion, not only introduced &s;eptennial, in place of tri|ennial elections; but by the &s;ame act continued them|&s;elves in place four years beyond the term for which they were elected by the people. An attention to the&s;e dangerous practices has produced a very natural alarm in the votaries of free government, of which frequency of elections is the corner &s;tone; and has led them to &s;eek for &s;ome &s;ecurity to liberty again&s;t the danger to which it is expo&s;ed. Where no con&s;titu|tion paramount to the government, either exi&s;ted or could be obtained, no con&s;titutional &s;ecurity &s;imilar to that e&s;tabli&s;hed in the United States, was to be attempted. Some other &s;ecurity therefore was to be &s;ought for; and what better &s;ecurity would the ca&s;e admit, than that of &s;electing and appealing to &s;ome &s;imple and familiar portion of time, as a &s;tandard for mea&s;uring the danger of innovations, for fixing the national &s;entiment, and for uniting the patriotic exertions. The mo&s;t &s;imple and familiar portion of time, applicable to the &s;ubject, was that of a year; and hence the doctrine has been inculcated by a laudable zeal to erect &s;ome barrier again&s;t the gradual innovations of an unlimited government, that the advance towards tyranny was to be calculated by the di&s;tance of departure from the fixed point of annual elections. But what nece&s;&s;ity can there be of apply|ing this expedient to a government, limited as the federal government will be, by the authority of a paramount con&s;titution? Or who will pretend that the liberties of the people of America will not be more &s;ecure under biennial elections, unalterably fixed by &s;uch a con&s;titution, than tho&s;e of any other nation would be, where elections were annual or even more
<PB N="131" REF="021127_0368_0FB2502BB9E43C78">
frequent, but &s;ubject to alterations by the ordinary power of the government?</P>
<P>The &s;econd que&s;tion &s;tated is, whether biennial elections be nece&s;&s;ary or u&s;eful? The propriety of an&s;wering this que&s;tion in the affirmative will appear from &s;everal very obvious con&s;iderations.</P>
<P>No man can be a competent legi&s;lator who does not add to an upright intention and a &s;ound judg|ment, a certain degree of knowledge of the &s;ubjects on which he is to legi&s;late. A part of this know|ledge may be acquired by means of information which lie within the compa&s;s of men in private as well as public &s;tations. Another part can only be attained, or at lea&s;t thoroughly attained, by actual experience in the &s;tation which requires the u&s;e of it. The period of &s;ervice ought therefore in all &s;uch ca&s;es to bear &s;ome proportion to the extent of practical knowledge, requi&s;ite to the due performance of the &s;ervice. The period of legi&s;lative &s;ervice e&s;tabli&s;hed in mo&s;t of the &s;tates for the more numerous branch is, as we have &s;een, one year. The que&s;tion then may be put into this &s;imple form; does the period of two years bear no greater proportion to the knowledge requi&s;ite for federal legi&s;lation, than one year does to the knowledge requi&s;ite for &s;tate legi&s;lation? The very &s;tatement of the que&s;tion in this form, &s;ugge&s;ts the an&s;wer that ought to be given to it.</P>
<P>In a &s;ingle &s;tate, the requi&s;ite knowledge relates to the exi&s;ting laws which are uniform throughout the &s;tate, and with which all the citizens are more or le&s;s conver&s;ant; and to the general affairs of the &s;tate, which lie within a &s;mall compa&s;s, are not very diver&s;ified and occupy much of the attention and conver&s;ation of every cla&s;s of people. The great theatre of the United States pre&s;ents a very different &s;cene. The laws are &s;o far from being uniform, that they vary in every &s;tate; whil&s;t the public affairs of the union are &s;pread throughout a very exten&s;ive region, and are extremely diver&s;ified by the local

affairs connected with them, and can with difficulty be correctly learnt in any other place, than in the central councils, to which a knowledge of them will be brought by the repre&s;entatives of every part of the empire. Yet &s;ome knowledge of the affairs, and even of the laws of all the &s;tates, ought to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the members from each of the &s;tates. How can foreign trade be properly regulated by uniform laws, without &s;ome acquaintance with the commerce; the parts, the u&s;ages, and the regulations of the different &s;tates? How can the trade between the different &s;tates be duly regulated without &s;ome knowledge of their relative &s;ituations in the&s;e and other points? How can taxes be judiciou&s;ly impo&s;ed, and effectually collected, if they be not accommodated to the dif|ferent laws and local circum&s;tances relating to the&s;e objects in the different &s;tates? How can uniform regulations for the militia be duly provided without a &s;imilar knowledge of &s;ome internal circum&s;tances by which the &s;tates are di&s;tingui&s;hed from each other? The&s;e are the principal objects of federal legi&s;lation, and &s;ugge&s;t mo&s;t forceably, the exten&s;ive information which the repre&s;entatives ought to acquire. The other inferior objects will require a proportional degree of information with regard to them.</P>
<P>It is true that all the&s;e difficulties will by degrees be very much dimini&s;hed. The mo&s;t laborious ta&s;k will be the proper inauguration of the government, and the primeval formation of a federal code. Improve|ments on the fir&s;t draught will every year become both ea&s;ier and fewer. Pa&s;t tran&s;actions of the govern|ment will be a ready and accurate &s;ource of infor|mation to new members. The affairs of the union will become more and more objects of curio&s;ity and conver&s;ation among the citizens at large. And the increa&s;ed intercour&s;e among tho&s;e of different &s;tates will contribute not a little to diffu&s;e a mutual know|ledge of their affairs, as this again will contribute to a general a&s;&s;imilation of their manners and laws.

But with all the&s;e abatements the bu&s;ine&s;s of federal legi&s;lation mu&s;t continue &s;o far to exceed both in no|velty and difficulty the legi&s;lative bu&s;ine&s;s of a &s;ingle &s;tate, as to ju&s;tify the longer period of &s;ervice a&s;&s;igned to tho&s;e who are to tran&s;act it.</P>
<P>A branch of knowledge which belongs to the ac|quirements of a federal repre&s;entative, and which has not been mentioned, is that of foreign affairs. In regulating our own commerce, he ought to be not only acquainted with the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">eaties between the United States and other nations, but al&s;o with the commercial policy and laws of other nations. He ought not be altogether ignorant of the law of nations, for that as far it is a proper object of municipal legi&s;lation is &s;ubmitted to the federal government. And although the hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives is not immediately to participate in foreign negociations and arrangements, yet from the nece&s;&s;ary connection between the &s;everal branches of public affairs, tho&s;e particular branches will frequently de&s;erve attention in the ordinary cour&s;e of legi&s;lation, and will &s;ometimes demand particular legi&s;lative &s;anction and co-operation. Some portion of this knowledge may no doubt be acquired in a man's clo&s;et; but &s;ome of it al&s;o can only be derived from the public &s;ources of information; and all of it will be acquired to be&s;t effect by a practical attention to the &s;ubject during the period of actual &s;ervice in the legi&s;lature.</P>
<P>There are other con&s;iderations of le&s;s importance perhaps, but which are not unworthy of notice. The di&s;tance which many of the repre&s;entatives will be obliged to travel, and the arrangements rendered ne|ce&s;&s;ary by that circum&s;tance, might be much more &s;erious objections with fit men to this &s;ervice if limited to a &s;ingle year, than if extended to two years. No argument can be drawn on this &s;ubject from the ca&s;e of the delegates to the exi&s;ting congre&s;s. They are elected annually it is true; but their re-election is
<PB N="134" REF="021127_0371_0FB25035852BE210">
con&s;idered by the legi&s;lative a&s;&s;emblies almo&s;t as a matter of cour&s;e. The election of the repre&s;entatives by the people would not be governed by the &s;ame principle.</P>
<P>A few of the members, as happens in all &s;uch a&s;&s;emblies, will po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;uperior talents; will, by fre|quent re-elections, become members of long &s;tanding; will be thoroughly ma&s;ters of the public bu&s;ine&s;s, and perhaps not unwilling to avail them&s;elves of tho&s;e advantages. The greater the proportion of new members, and the le&s;s the information of the bulk of the members, the more apt will they be to fall into the &s;nares that may be laid for them. This remark is no le&s;s applicable to the relation which will &s;ub&s;i&s;t between the hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives and the &s;enate.</P>
<P>It is an inconvenience mingled with the advan|tages of our frequent elections, even in &s;ingle &s;tates, where they are large and hold but one legi&s;lative &s;e&s;&s;ion in the year, that &s;purious elections cannot be inve&s;tigated and annulled in time for the deci&s;ion to have its due effect. If a return can be obtained, no matter by what unlawful means, the irregular member, who takes his &s;eat of cour&s;e, is &s;ure of holding it a &s;ufficient time to an&s;wer his purpo&s;es. Hence a very pernicious encouragement is given to the u&s;e of un|lawful means for obtaining irregular returns. Were elections for the federal legi&s;lature to be annual, this practice might become a very &s;erious abu&s;e, particu|larly in the more di&s;tant &s;tates. Each hou&s;e is, as it nece&s;&s;arily mu&s;t be, the judge of the elections, quali|fications and returns of its members, and whatever improvements may be &s;ugge&s;ted by experience for &s;implifying and accelerating the proce&s;s in di&s;puted ca&s;es, &s;o great a portion of a year would unavoid|ably elap&s;e, before an illegitimate member could be di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of his &s;eat, that the pro&s;pect of &s;uch an event would be little check to unfair and illicit means of obtaining a &s;eat.</P>

<HEAD>NUMBER LIV. The &s;ame Subject continued with a View to the Ratio of Repre&s;entation.</HEAD>
<P>THE next view which I &s;hall take of the hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives, relates to the appor|tionment of its members to the &s;everal &s;tates, which is to be determined by the &s;ame rule with that of direct taxes.</P>
<P>It is not contended that the number of people in each &s;tate ought not to be the &s;tandard for regulating the proportion of tho&s;e who are to repre&s;ent the people of each &s;tate. The e&s;tabli&s;hment of the &s;ame rule for the apportionment of taxes, will probably be as little conte&s;ted; though the rule it&s;elf in this ca&s;e, is by no means founded on the &s;ame principle. In the former ca&s;e, the rule is under&s;tood to refer to the per|&s;onal rights of the people, with which it has a natural and univer&s;al connection. In the latter, it has refer|ence to the proportion of wealth, of which it is in no ca&s;e a preci&s;e mea&s;ure, and in ordinary ca&s;es, a very unfit one. But notwith&s;tanding the imperfection of the rule as applied to the relative wealth and contributions of the &s;tates, it is evidently the lea&s;t exceptionable among the practicable rules; and had too recently obtained the general &s;anction of America, not to have found a ready preference with the convention.</P>
<P>All this is admitted, it will perhaps be &s;aid: But does it follow from an admi&s;&s;ion of numbers for the mea&s;ure of repre&s;entation, or of &s;laves combined with
<PB N="136" REF="021127_0373_0FB250386CF500B0">
free citizens, as a ratio of taxation, that &s;laves ought to be included in the numerical rule of repre&s;entation? Slaves are con&s;idered as property, not as per&s;ons. They ought therefore to be comprehended in e&s;ti|mates of taxation which are founded on property, and to be excluded from repre&s;entation which is regulated by a cen&s;us of per&s;ons. This is the objection, as I under&s;tand it, &s;tated in its full force. I &s;hall be equally candid in &s;tating the rea&s;oning which may be offered on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide.</P>
<P>We &s;ub&s;cribe to the doctrine, might one of our &s;outhern brethren ob&s;erve, that repre&s;entation relates more immediately to per&s;ons, and taxation more immediately to property, and we join in the appli|cation of this di&s;tinction to the ca&s;e of our &s;laves. But we mu&s;t deny the fact that &s;laves are con&s;idered merely as property, and in no re&s;pect whatever as per&s;ons. The true &s;tate of the ca&s;e is, that they partake of both the&s;e qualities; being con&s;idered by our laws, in &s;ome re&s;pects, as per&s;ons, and in other re&s;pects, as pro|perty. In being compelled to labor not for him&s;elf, but for a ma&s;ter; in being vendible by one ma&s;ter to another ma&s;ter; and in being &s;ubject at all times to be re&s;trained in his liberty, and cha&s;ti&s;ed in his body, by the capricious will of another, the &s;lave may appear to be degraded from the human rank, and cla&s;&s;ed with tho&s;e irrational animals, which fall under the legal denomination of property. In being pro|tected on the other hand in his life and in his limbs, again&s;t the violence of all others, even the ma&s;ter of his labour and his liberty; and in being puni&s;hable him&s;elf for all violence committed again&s;t others; the &s;lave is no le&s;s evidently regarded by the law as a member of the &s;ociety; not as a part of the irrational creation; as a moral per&s;on, not as a mere article of property. The federal con&s;titution therefore, decides with great propriety on the ca&s;e of our &s;laves, when it views them in the mixt character of per&s;ons and of property. This is in fact their true character. It is
<PB N="137" REF="021127_0374_0FB250444DF56510">
the character be&s;towed on them by the laws under which they live; and it will not be denied that the&s;e are the proper criterion; becau&s;e it is only under the pretext that the laws have transformed the negroes into &s;ubjects of property, that a place is di&s;puted them in the computation of numbers; and it is admitted that if the laws were to re&s;tore the rights which have been taken away, the negroes could no longer be refu&s;ed an equal &s;hare of repre&s;entation with the other inhabitants.</P>
<P>This que&s;tion may be placed in another light. It is agreed on all &s;ides, that numbers are the be&s;t &s;cale of wealth and taxation, as they are the only proper &s;cale of repre&s;ention. Would the Convention have been impartial or con&s;i&s;tent, if they had rejected the &s;laves from the li&s;t of inhabitants when the &s;hares of repre&s;entation were to be calculated; and in&s;erted them on the li&s;ts when the tariff of contributions was to be adju&s;ted? Could it be rea&s;onably expected that the &s;outhern &s;tates would concur in a &s;y&s;tem which con&s;idered their &s;laves in &s;ome degree as men, when burdens were to be impo&s;ed, but refu&s;ed to con&s;ider them in the &s;ame light when advantages were to be conferred? Might not &s;ome &s;urprize al&s;o be expre&s;|&s;ed that tho&s;e who reproach the &s;outhern &s;tates with the barbarous policy of con&s;idering as property, a part of their human brethren, &s;hould them&s;elves contend that the government to which all the &s;tates are to be parties, ought to con&s;ider this unfortunate race more compleatly in the unnatural light of pro|perty, than the very laws of which they complain!</P>
<P>It may be replied perhaps that &s;laves are not included in the e&s;timate of repre&s;entatives in any of the &s;tates po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing them. They neither vote them|&s;elves, nor increa&s;e the votes of their ma&s;ters. Upon what principle then ought they to be taken into the federal e&s;timate of repre&s;entation? In rejecting them altogether, we con&s;titution would in this re&s;pect,
<PB N="138" REF="021127_0375_0FB2504807A52B28">
have followed the very laws which have been appealed to, as the proper guide.</P>
<P>This objection is repelled by a &s;ingle ob&s;ervation. It is a fundamental principle of the propo&s;ed con&s;ti|tution, that as the aggregate number of repre&s;enta|tives allotted to the &s;everal &s;tates is to be determined by a federal rule founded on the aggregate number of inhabitants, &s;o the right of choo&s;ing this allotted number in each &s;tate is to be exerci&s;ed by &s;uch part of the inhabitants, as the &s;tate it&s;elf may de&s;ignate. The qualifications on which the right of &s;uffrage depend, are not perhaps the &s;ame in any two &s;tates. In &s;ome of the &s;tates the difference is very material. In every &s;tate a certain proportion of inhabitants are deprived of this right by the con&s;titution of the &s;tate, who will be included in the cen&s;us by which the federal con&s;titution apportions the repre&s;entatives. In this point of view, the &s;outhern &s;tates might retort the complaint, by in&s;i&s;ting, that the principle laid down by the convention required that no regard &s;hould be had to the policy of particular &s;tates towards their own inhabitants; and con&s;equently, that the &s;laves as inhabitants &s;hould have been admitted into the cen&s;us occording to their full number, in like manner with other inhabitants, who by the policy of other &s;tates, are not admitted to all the rights of citizens. A rigorous adherence however, to this principle, is waved by tho&s;e who would be gainers by it. All that they a&s;k is, that equal moderation be &s;hewn on the other &s;ide. Let the ca&s;e of the &s;laves be con&s;idered, as it is in truth a peculiar one. Let the compromi&s;ing expedient of the con&s;titution be mutually adopted, which regards them as inhabitants, but as deba&s;ed by &s;ervitude below the equal level of free inhabitants, which regards the <HI>&s;lave</HI> as dive&s;ted of two fifths of the <HI>man.</HI></P>
<P>After all, may not another ground be taken on which this article of the con&s;titution will admit of a &s;till more ready defence? We have hitherto pro|ceeded
<PB N="139" REF="021127_0376_0FB25049B9FF9090">
on the idea that repre&s;entation related to per&s;ons only, and not at all to property. But is it a ju&s;t idea? Government is in&s;tituted no le&s;s for pro|tection of the property, than of the per&s;ons of indi|viduals. The one as well as the other, therefore, may be con&s;idered as repre&s;ented by tho&s;e who are charged with the government. Upon this principle it is, that in &s;everal of the &s;tates, and particularly in the &s;tate of New-York, one branch of the govern|ment is intended more e&s;pecially to be the guardian of property, and is accordingly elected by that part of the &s;ociety which is mo&s;t intere&s;ted in this object of government. In the federal con&s;titution this policy does not prevail. The rights of property are committed into the &s;ame hands with the per&s;onal rights. Some attention ought therefore to be paid to property in the choice of tho&s;e hands.</P>
<P>For another rea&s;on the votes allowed in the federal legi&s;lature to the people of each &s;tate, ought to bear &s;ome proportion to the comparitive wealth of the &s;tates. States have not, like individuals, an influ|ence over each other ari&s;ing from &s;uperior advantages of fortune. If the law allows an opulent citizen but a &s;ingle vote in the choice of his repre&s;entative, the re&s;pect and con&s;equence which he derives from his fortunate &s;ituation, very frequently guide the votes of others to the objects of his choice; and through this imperceptible channel the rights of property are conveyed into the public repre&s;entation. A &s;tate po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es no &s;uch influence over other &s;tates. It is not probable that the riche&s;t &s;tate in the confe|deracy will ever influence the choice of a &s;ingle repre&s;entative in any other &s;tate. Nor will the repre&s;entatives of the larger and richer &s;tates, po&s;&s;e&s;s any other advantage in the federal legi&s;la|ture over the repre&s;entatives of other &s;tates, than what may re&s;ult from their &s;uperior number alone; as far therefore as their &s;uperior wealth and weight may ju&s;tly entitle them to any advantage, it ought
<PB N="140" REF="021127_0377_0FB2504B35F33010">
to be &s;ecured to them by a &s;uperior &s;hare of repre|&s;entation. The new con&s;titution is in this re&s;pect materially different from the exi&s;ting confederation, as well as from that of the United Netherlands, and other &s;imilar confederacies. In each of the latter, the efficacy of the federal re&s;olutions depends on the &s;ub&s;equent and voluntary re&s;olutions of the &s;tates compo&s;ing the union. Hence the &s;tates, though po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing an equal vote in the public councils, have an unequal influence, corre&s;ponding with the un|equal importance of the&s;e &s;ub&s;equent and voluntary re&s;olutions. Under the propo&s;ed con&s;titution, the federal acts will take effect without the nece&s;&s;ary intervention of the individual &s;tates. They will depend merely on the majority of votes in the federal legi&s;lature, and con&s;equently each vote, whether proceeding from a larger or &s;ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ler &s;ta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e, or a &s;tate more or le&s;s wealthy or powerful, will have an equal weight and efficacy; in the &s;ame manner as the votes individually given in a &s;tate legi&s;lature, by the repre&s;entatives of unequal counties or other di&s;tricts, have each a preci&s;e equality of value and effect; or if there be any difference in the ca&s;e, it proceeds from the difference in the per&s;onal charac|ter of the individual repre&s;entative, rather than from any regard to the extent of the di&s;trict from which he comes.</P>
<P>Such is the rea&s;oning which an advocate for the &s;outhern intere&s;ts might employ on this &s;ubject: And although it may appear to be a little &s;trained in &s;ome points, yet on the whole, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, that it fully reconciles me to the &s;cale of repre&s;enta|tion, which the convention have e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>
<P>In one re&s;pect the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a common mea|&s;ure for repre&s;entation and taxation will have a very &s;alutary effect. As the accuracy of the cen&s;us to be obtained by the congre&s;s, will nece&s;&s;arily depend in a con&s;iderable decree on the di&s;po&s;ition, if not the co-operation of the &s;tates, it is of great importance
<PB N="141" REF="021127_0378_0FB2504DD18CCC40">
that the &s;tates &s;hould feel as little bias as po&s;&s;ible to &s;well or to reduce the amount of their numbers. Were their &s;hare of repre&s;entation alone to be governed by this rule, they would have an intere&s;t in exaggerating their inhabitants. Were the rule to decide their &s;hare of taxation alone, a contrary temptation would prevail. By extending the rule to both objects, the &s;tates will have oppo&s;ite intere&s;ts, which will control and ballance each other; and produce the requi&s;ite impartiality.</P>

<HEAD>NUMBER LV. The &s;ame Subject continued in Relation to the total Number of the Body.</HEAD>
<P>THE number of which the hou&s;e of repre&s;en|tatives is to con&s;i&s;t, forms another, and a very intere&s;ting point of view under which this branch of the federal legi&s;lature may be contem|plated. Scarce any article indeed in the whole con|&s;titution &s;eems to be rendered more worthy of atten|tion, by the weight of character and the apparent force of argument, with which it has been a&s;&s;ailed. The charges exhibited again&s;t it are, fir&s;t, that &s;o &s;mall a number of repre&s;entatives will be an un&s;afe depo&s;itary of the public intere&s;ts; &s;econdly, that they will not po&s;&s;e&s;s a proper knowledge of the local circum&s;tances of their numerous con&s;tituents; thirdly, that they will be taken from that cla&s;s of citizens which will &s;ympathi&s;e lea&s;t with the feelings of the ma&s;s of the people, and be mo&s;t likely to aim at a permanent elevation of the few on the depre&s;&s;ion of the many; fourthly, that defective as the number will be in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, it will be more and more di&s;proportionate, by the increa&s;e of the people, and
<PB N="142" REF="021127_0379_0FB2504EF945E938">
the ob&s;tacles which will prevent a corre&s;pondent increa&s;e of the repre&s;entatives.</P>
<P>In general it may be remarked on this &s;ubject, that no polical problem is le&s;s &s;u&s;ceptible of a preci&s;e &s;olu|tion, than that which relates to the number mo&s;t con|venient for a repre&s;entative legi&s;lature; nor is there any point on which the policy of the &s;everal &s;tates is more at variance; whether we compare their legi&s;lative a&s;&s;emblies directly with each other, or con&s;ider the pro|portions which they re&s;pectively bear to the number of their con&s;tituents. Pa&s;&s;ing over the difference between the &s;malle&s;t and large&s;t &s;tates, as Delaware, who&s;e mo&s;t numerous branch con&s;i&s;ts of twenty-one repre&s;en|tatives, and Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, where it amounts to between three and four hundred; a very con&s;iderable difference is ob&s;ervable among &s;tates nearly equal in population. The number of repre&s;entatives in Penn|&s;ylvania is not more than one fifth of that in the &s;tate la&s;t mentioned. New-York, who&s;e population is to that of South-Carolina as &s;ix to five, has little more than one third of the number of repre&s;entatives. As great a di&s;parity prevails between the &s;tates of Georgia and Delaware, or Rhode-I&s;land. In Penn&s;ylvania the repre&s;entatives do not bear a greater proportion to their con&s;tituents than of one for every four or five thou&s;and. In Rhode-I&s;land, they bear a proportion of at lea&s;t one for every thou&s;and. And according to the con&s;titution of Georgia, the proportion may be carried to one for every ten electors; and mu&s;t unavoidably far exceed the proportion in any of the other &s;tates.</P>
<P>Another general remark to be made is, that the ratio between the repre&s;entatives and the people, ought not to be the &s;ame where the latter are very numerous, as where they are very few. Were the repre&s;entatives in Virginia to be regulated by the &s;tandard in Rhode-I&s;land, they would at this time amount to between four and five hundred; and twenty or thirty years hence, to a thou&s;and. On the other
<PB N="143" REF="021127_0380_0FB2505154A7FE90">
hand, the ratio of Penn&s;ylvania, if applied to the &s;tate of Delaware, would reduce the repre&s;entative a&s;&s;embly of the latter to &s;even or eight members. Nothing can be more fallacious than to found our political calcu|lations on arithmetical principles. Sixty or &s;eventy men, may be more properly tru&s;ted with a given degree of power than &s;ix or &s;even. But it does not follow, that &s;ix or &s;even hundred would be propor|tionally a better depo&s;itary. And if we carry on the &s;uppo&s;ition to &s;ix or &s;even thou&s;and, the whole rea|&s;oning ought to be rever&s;ed. The truth is, that in all ca&s;es a certain number at lea&s;t &s;eems to be nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ecure the benefits of free con&s;ultation and di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, and to guard again&s;t too ea&s;y a combi|nation for improper purpo&s;es: As on the other hand, the number ought at mo&s;t to be kept within a certain limit, in order to avoid the confu&s;ion and intem|perance of a multitude. In all very numerous a&s;&s;emblies, of whatever characters compo&s;ed, pa&s;&s;ion never fails to wre&s;t the &s;ceptre from rea&s;on. Had every Athenian citizen been a Socrates; every Athenian a&s;&s;embly would &s;till have been a mob.</P>
<P>It is nece&s;&s;ary al&s;o to recollect here the ob&s;erva|tions which were applied to the ca&s;e of biennial elections. For the &s;ame rea&s;on that the limited powers of the congre&s;s and the control of the &s;tate legi&s;latures, ju&s;tify le&s;s frequent elections than the public &s;afety might otherwi&s;e require; the mem|bers of the congre&s;s need be le&s;s numerous than if they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the whole power of legi&s;lation, and were under no other than the ordinary re&s;traints of other legi&s;lative bodies.</P>
<P>With the&s;e general ideas in our minds, let us weigh the objections which have been &s;tated again&s;t the number of members propo&s;ed for the hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives. It is &s;aid in the fir&s;t place, that &s;o &s;mall a number cannot be &s;afely tru&s;ted with &s;o much power.</P>
<P><PB N="144" REF="021127_0381_0FB25052B1E2B8B0">The number of which this branch of the legi&s;lature is to con&s;i&s;t at the out&s;et of the government, will be &s;ixty-five. Within three years a cen&s;us is to be taken, when the number may be augmented to one for every thirty thou&s;and inhabitants; and within every &s;ucce&s;&s;ive period of ten years, the cen&s;us is to be renewed, and augmentations may continue to be made under the above limitation. It will not be thought an extravagant conjecture, that the fir&s;t cen&s;us will, at the rate of one for every thirty thou|&s;and, rai&s;e the number of repre&s;entatives to at lea&s;t one hundred. E&s;timating the negroes in the pro|portion of three-fifths, it can &s;carcely be doubted that the population of the United States will by that time, if it does not already, amount to three millions. At the expiration of twenty-five years, according to the computed rate of increa&s;e, the number of repre&s;entatives will amount to two hun|dred; and of fifty years to four hundred. This is a number which I pre&s;ume will put an end to all fears ari&s;ing from the &s;mallne&s;s of the body. I take for granted here what I &s;hall in an&s;wering the fourth objection hereafter &s;hew, that the number of repre|&s;entatives will be augmented from time to time in the manner provided by the con&s;titution. On a contrary &s;uppo&s;ition, I &s;hould admit the objection to have very great weight indeed.</P>
<P>The true que&s;tion to be decided then is, whether the &s;mallne&s;s of the number as a temporary regula|tion, be dangerous to the public liberty: Whether &s;ixty-five members for a few years, and a hundred or two hundred for a few more, be a &s;afe depo&s;itary for a limited and well guarded power of legi&s;lating for the United States? I mu&s;t own that I could not give a negative an&s;wer to this que&s;tion, without fir&s;t obliterating every impre&s;&s;ion which I have received with regard to the pre&s;ent genius of the people of America, the &s;pirit which actuates the &s;tate legi&s;|latures, and the principles which are incorporated
<PB N="145" REF="021127_0382_0FB250574388A1F0">
with the political character of every cla&s;s of citizens. I am unable to conceive that the people of America in their pre&s;ent temper, or under any circum&s;tances which can &s;peedily happen, will chu&s;e, and every &s;econd year repeat the choice of &s;ixty-five or an hundred men, who would be di&s;po&s;ed to form and pur&s;ue a &s;cheme of tyranny or treachery. I am unable to conceive that the &s;tate legi&s;latures which mu&s;t feel &s;o many motives to watch, and which po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;o many means of counteracting the federal legi&s;lature, would fail either to detect or to defeat a con&s;piracy of the latter again&s;t the liberties of their common con&s;tituents. I am equally unable to con|ceive that there are at this time, or can be in any &s;hort time, in the United States, any &s;ixty-five or an hundred men capable of recommending them|&s;elves to the choice of the people at large, who would either de&s;ire or dare within the &s;hort &s;pace of two years, to betray the &s;olemn tru&s;t committed to them. What change of circum&s;tances time and a fuller population of our country may produce, requires a prophetic &s;pirit to declare, which makes no part of my preten&s;ions. But judging from the circum&s;tances now before us, and from the probable &s;tate of them within a moderate period of time, I mu&s;t pronounce that the liberties of America cannot be un&s;afe in the number of hands propo&s;ed by the federal con&s;titution.</P>
<P>From what quarter can the danger proceed? Are we afraid of foreign gold? If foreign gold could &s;o ea&s;ily corrupt our federal rulers, and enable them to en&s;nare and betray their con&s;tituents, how has it happened that we are at this time a free and inde|pendent nation? The congre&s;s which conducted us through the revolution were a le&s;s numerous body than their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors will be; they were not cho&s;en by nor re&s;pon&s;ible to their fellow citizens at large; though appointed from year to year, and recallable at plea&s;ure, they were generally continued for three
<PB N="146" REF="021127_0383_0FB2505916506AE8">
years; and prior to the ratification of the federal articles, for a &s;till longer term; they held their con|&s;ultations always under the veil of &s;ecre&s;y; they had the &s;ole tran&s;action of our affairs with foreign nations; through the whole cour&s;e of the war, they had the fate of their country more in their hands, than it is to be hoped will ever be the ca&s;e with our future repre&s;en|tatives; and from the greatne&s;s of the prize at &s;take and the eagerne&s;s of the party which lo&s;t it, it may well be &s;uppo&s;ed, that the u&s;e of other means than force would not have been &s;crupled: Yet we know by happy experience that the public tru&s;t was not betrayed; nor has the purity of our public councils in this particular ever &s;uffered even from the whi&s;pers of calumny.</P>
<P>Is the danger apprehended from the other branches of the federal government? But where are the means to be found by the pre&s;ident or the &s;enate, or both? Their emoluments of office it is to be pre&s;umed will not, and without a previous corruption of the hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives cannot, more than &s;uffice for very different purpo&s;es: Their private fortunes, as they mu&s;t all be American citizens, cannot po&s;&s;ibly be &s;ources of danger. The only means then which they can po&s;&s;e&s;s, will be in the di&s;pen&s;ation of appoint|ments. Is it here that &s;u&s;picion re&s;ts her charge? Sometimes we are told that this fund of corruption is to be exhau&s;ted by the pre&s;ident in &s;ubduing the virtue of the &s;enate. Now the fidelity of the other hou&s;e is to be the victim. The improbability of &s;uch a mercenary and perfidious combination of the &s;everal members of government &s;tanding on as different foun|dations as republican principles will well admit, and at the &s;ame time accountable to the &s;ociety over which they are placed, ought alone to quiet this appre|hen&s;ion. But fortunately the con&s;titution has pro|vided a &s;till further &s;afeguard. The members of the congre&s;s are rendered ineligible to any civil offices that may be created or of which the emoluments may
<PB N="147" REF="021127_0384_0FB2505F044BEA20">
be increa&s;ed, during the term of their election. No offices therefore can be dealt out to the exi&s;ting mem|bers, but &s;uch as many become vacant by ordinary ca&s;ualties; and to &s;uppo&s;e that the&s;e would be &s;uffi|cient to purcha&s;e the guardians of the people, &s;elected by the people them&s;elves, is to renounce every rule by which events ought to be calculated, and to &s;ub|&s;titute an indi&s;criminate and unbounded jealou&s;y, with which all rea&s;oning mu&s;t be vain. The &s;incere friends of liberty who give them&s;elves up to the extravagancies of this pa&s;&s;ion are not aware of the injury they do their own cau&s;e. As there is a degree of depravity in mankind which requires a certain degree of circum&s;pection and di&s;tru&s;t: So there are other qualities in human nature, which ju&s;tify a certain portion of e&s;teem and confidence. Republican government pre&s;uppo&s;es the exi&s;tence of the&s;e qua|lities in a higher degree than any other form. Were the pictures which have been drawn by the political jealou&s;y of &s;ome among us, faithful likene&s;&s;es of the human character, the inference would be that there is not &s;ufficient virtue among men for &s;elf govern|ment; and that nothing le&s;s than the chains of de&s;poti&s;m can re&s;train them from de&s;troying and devouring one another.</P>

<P>THE <HI>&s;econd</HI> charge again&s;t the hou&s;e of repre&s;en|tatives is, that it will be too &s;mall to po&s;&s;e&s;s a due knowledge of the intere&s;ts of its con&s;tituents.</P>
<P>As this objection evidently proceeds from a com|pari&s;on of the propo&s;ed number of repre&s;entatives,
<PB N="148" REF="021127_0385_0FB25062F0983368">
with the great extent of the United States, the num|ber of their inhabitants, and the diver&s;ity of their intere&s;ts, without taking into view at the &s;ame time the circum&s;tances which will di&s;tingui&s;h the congre&s;s from other legi&s;lative bodies, the be&s;t an&s;wer that can be given to it, will be a brief explanation of the&s;e peculiarities.</P>
<P>It is a &s;ound and important principle, that the repre&s;entative ought to be acquainted with the intere&s;ts and circum&s;tances of his con&s;tituents. But this principle can extend no farther than to tho&s;e cir|cum&s;tances and intere&s;ts to which the authority and care of the repre&s;entative relate. An ignorance of a variety of minute and particular objects, which do not lie within the compa&s;s of legi&s;lation, is con&s;i&s;tent with every attribute nece&s;&s;ary to a due performance of the legi&s;lative tru&s;t. In determining the extent of information required in the exerci&s;e of a parti|cular authority, recour&s;e then mu&s;t be had to the objects within the purview of that authority.</P>
<P>What are to be the objects of federal legi&s;lation? Tho&s;e which are of mo&s;t importance, and which &s;eem mo&s;t to require local knowledge, are commerce, taxation and the militia.</P>
<P>A proper regulation of commerce requires much information, as has been el&s;ewhere remarked; but as far as this information relates to the laws and local &s;ituation of each individual &s;tate, a very few repre&s;entatives would be very &s;ufficient vehicles of it to the federal councils.</P>
<P>Taxation will con&s;i&s;t in great mea&s;ure, of duties which will be involved in the regulation of com|merce. So far the preceding remark is applicable to this object. As far as it may con&s;i&s;t of internal collections, a more diffu&s;ive knowledge of the cir|cum&s;tances of the &s;tate may be nece&s;&s;ary. But will not this al&s;o be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in &s;ufficient degree by a very few intelligent men, diffu&s;ively elected within the &s;tate. Divide the large&s;t &s;tate into ten or twelve
<PB N="149" REF="021127_0386_0FB25066F2669E50">
di&s;tricts, and it will be found that there will be no peculiar local intere&s;t in either, which will not be within the knowledge of the repre&s;entative of the di&s;trict. Be&s;ides this &s;ource of information, the laws of the &s;tate framed by repre&s;entatives from every part of it, will be almo&s;t of them&s;elves a &s;ufficient guide. In every &s;tate there have been made, and mu&s;t con|tinue to be made, regulations on this &s;ubject, which will in many ca&s;es leave little more to be done by the federal legi&s;lature, than to review the different laws, and reduce them into one general act. A &s;kilful individual in his clo&s;et, with all the local codes before him, might compile a law on &s;ome &s;ubjects of taxation for the whole union, without any aid from oral infor|mation; and it may be expected, that whenever internal taxes may be nece&s;&s;ary, and particularly in ca&s;es requiring uniformity throughout the &s;tates, the more &s;imple objects will be preferred. To be fully &s;en&s;ible of the facility which will be given to this branch of federal legi&s;lation, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the &s;tate codes, we need only &s;uppo&s;e for a mo|ment, that this or any other &s;tate were divided into a number of parts, each having and exerci&s;ing within it&s;elf a power of local legi&s;lation. Is it not evident that a degree of local information and prepa|ratory labour would be found in the &s;everal volumes of their proceedings, which would very much &s;horten the labours of the general legi&s;lature, and render a much &s;maller number of members &s;ufficient for it? The federal councils will derive great advantage from another circum&s;tance. The repre&s;entatives of each &s;tate will not only bring with them a con&s;ider|able knowledge of its laws, and a local knowlege of their re&s;pective di&s;tricts; but will probably in all ca&s;es have been members, and may even at the very time be members of the &s;tate legi&s;lature, where all the local information and intere&s;ts of the &s;tate are a&s;&s;embled, and from whence they may ea&s;ily be
<PB N="150" REF="021127_0387_0FB2506BCD59E090">
conveyed by a very few hands into the legi&s;lature of the United States.</P>
<P>With regard to the regulation of the militia, there are &s;carcely any circum&s;tances in reference to which local knowledge can be &s;aid to be nece&s;&s;ary. The general face of the country, whether mountainous or level, mo&s;t fit for the operations of infantry or cavalry, is almo&s;t the only con&s;ideration of this nature that can occur. The art of war teaches general princi|ples of organization, movement and di&s;cipline, which apply univer&s;ally.</P>
<P>The attentive reader will di&s;cern that the rea&s;oning here u&s;ed to prove the &s;ufficiency of a moderate number of repre&s;entatives, does not in any re&s;pect contradict what was urged on another occa&s;ion with regard to the exten&s;ive information which the repre|&s;entatives ought to po&s;&s;e&s;s, and the time that might be nece&s;&s;ary for acquiring it. This information, &s;o far as it may relate to local objects, is rendered nece&s;|&s;ary and difficult, not by a difference of laws and local circum&s;tances within a &s;ingle &s;tate, but of tho&s;e among different &s;tates. Taking each &s;tate by it&s;elf, its laws are the &s;ame, and its intere&s;ts but little diver&s;ified. A few men therefore will po&s;&s;e&s;s all the knowledge requi&s;ite for a proper repre&s;entation of them. Were the intere&s;ts and affairs of each indi|vidual &s;tate, perfectly &s;imple and uniform, a know|ledge of them in one part would involve a knowledge of them in every other, and the whole &s;tate might be competently repre&s;ented, by a &s;ingle member taken from any part of it. On a compari&s;on of the different &s;tates together, we find a great di&s;&s;imilarity in their laws, and in many other circum&s;tances connected with the objects of federal legi&s;lation, with all of which the federal repre&s;entatives ought to have &s;ome acquaintance. Whil&s;t a few repre&s;entatives therefore from each &s;tate may bring with them a due knowledge of their own &s;tate, every repre&s;en|tative will have much information to acquire con|cerning
<PB N="151" REF="021127_0388_0FB2506CF47663B0">
all the other &s;tates. The changes of time, as was formerly remarked, on the comparative &s;ituation of the different &s;tates, will have an a&s;&s;imilating effect. The effect of time on the internal affairs of the &s;tates taken &s;ingly, will be ju&s;t the contrary. At pre&s;ent &s;ome of the &s;tates are little more than a &s;ociety of hu&s;handmen. Few of them have made much progre&s;s in tho&s;e branches of indu&s;try, which give a variety and complexity to the affairs of a nation. The&s;e however will in all of them be the fruits of a more advanced population; and will require on the part of each &s;tate a fuller repre&s;en|tation. The fore&s;ight of the convention has accor|dingly taken care that the progre&s;s of population may be accompanied with a proper increa&s;e of the repre&s;entative branch of the government.</P>
<P>The experience of Great Britain which pre&s;ents to mankind &s;o many political le&s;&s;ons, both of the moni|tory and exemplary kind, and which has been fre|quently con&s;ulted in the cour&s;e of the&s;e enquiries, corroborates the re&s;ult of the reflections which we have ju&s;t made. The number of inhabitants in the two kingdoms of England and Scotland, cannot be &s;tated at le&s;s than eight millions. The repre&s;entatives of the&s;e eight millions in the hou&s;e of commons, amount to five hundred fifty eight. Of this number one ninth are elected by three hundred and &s;ixty four per&s;ons, and one half by five thou&s;and &s;even hundred and twenty three per&s;ons<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Burgh's Political Di&s;qui&s;itions.</NOTE>. It cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed that the half thus elected, and who do not even re&s;ide among the people at large, can add any thing either to the &s;ecurity of the people again&s;t the government, or to the knowledge of their circum&s;tances and intere&s;ts, in the legi&s;lative councils. On the contrary it is notorious that they are more frequently the repre&s;entatives and in&s;truments of the executive magi&s;trate, than the guardians und advocates of the popular rights. They might therefore with great
<PB N="152" REF="021127_0389_0FB2506EEEF6C808">
propriety be con&s;idered as &s;omething more than a mere deduction from the real repre&s;entatives of the nation. We will however con&s;ider them, in this light alone, and will not extend the deduction, to a con&s;iderable number of others, who do not re&s;ide among their con&s;tituents, are very faintly connected with them, and have very little particular know|ledge of their affairs. With all the&s;e conce&s;&s;ions two hundred and &s;eventy nine per&s;ons only will be the depo&s;itary of the &s;afety, intere&s;t and happine&s;s of eight millions; that is to &s;ay; there will be one repre&s;entative only to maintain the rights and explain the &s;ituation <HI>of twenty-eight thou&s;and &s;ix hundred and &s;eventy</HI> con&s;tituents, in an a&s;&s;embly expo&s;ed to the whole force of executive influence, and extending its authority to every object of legi&s;lation within a nation who&s;e affairs are in the highe&s;t degree diver|&s;ified and complicated. Yet it is very certain not only that a valuable portion of freedom has been pre&s;erved under all the&s;e circum&s;tances, but that the defects in the Briti&s;h code are chargeable in a very &s;mall proportion, on the ignorance of the legi&s;lature concerning the circum&s;tances of the people. Allow|ing to this ca&s;e the weight which is due to it; and comparing it with that of the hou&s;e of repre&s;enta|tives as above explained, it &s;eems to give the fulle&s;t a&s;&s;urance that a repre&s;entative for every <HI>thirty thou|&s;and inhabitants</HI> will render the latter both a &s;afe and competent guardian of the intere&s;ts which will be confided to it.</P>

<HEAD>NUMBER LVII. The &s;ame Subject continued in Relation to the &s;uppo&s;ed tendency of the Plan of the Con|vention to elevate the few above the many.</HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>third</HI> charge again&s;t the hou&s;e of repre&s;en|tatives is, that it will be taken from that cla&s;s of citizens which will have lea&s;t &s;ympathy with the ma&s;s of the people, and be mo&s;t likely to aim at an ambitious &s;acrifice of the many to the aggrandize|ment of the few.</P>
<P>Of all the objections which have been framed again&s;t the federal con&s;titution, this is perhaps the mo&s;t extraordinary. Whil&s;t the objection it&s;elf is levelled again&s;t a pretended oligarchy, the prin|ciple of it &s;trikes at the very root of republican government.</P>
<P>The aim of every political con&s;titution is, or ought to be, fir&s;t, to obtain for rulers men who po&s;&s;e&s;s mo&s;t wi&s;dom to di&s;cern, and mo&s;t virtue to pur&s;ue the common good of the &s;ociety; and in the next place, to take the mo&s;t effectual precautions for keeping them virtuous, whil&s;t they continue to hold their public tru&s;t. The elective mode of obtaining rulers is the characteri&s;tic policy of republican government. The means relied on in this form of government for preventing their degeneracy, are numerous and vari|ous. The mo&s;t effectual one is &s;uch a limitation of the term of appointments, as will maintain a proper re&s;pon&s;ibility to the people.</P>
<P>Let me now a&s;k what circum&s;tance there is in the con&s;titution of the hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives, that violates the principles of republican government; or favors the elevation of the few on the ruins of the many? Let me a&s;k whether every circum&s;tance is not, on the contrary, &s;trictly conformable to the&s;e
<PB N="154" REF="021127_0391_0FB2478500722E78">
principles; and &s;crupulou&s;ly impartial to the rights and preten&s;ions of every cla&s;s and de&s;cription of citizens?</P>
<P>Who are to be the electors of the federal repre|&s;entatives? Not the rich more than the poor; not the learned more than the ignorant; not the haughty heirs of di&s;tingui&s;hed names, more than the humble &s;ons of ob&s;cure and unpropitious fortune. The elec|tors are to be the great body of the people of the United States. They are to be the &s;ame who exerci&s;e the right in every &s;tate of electing the corre&s;pondent branch of the legi&s;lature of the &s;tate.</P>
<P>Who are to be the objects of popular choice? Every citizen who&s;e merit may recommend him to the e&s;teem and confidence of his country. No qualifi|cation of wealth, of birth, of religious faith, or of civil profe&s;&s;ion, is permitted to fetter the judgment or di&s;appoint the inclination of the people.</P>
<P>If we con&s;ider the &s;ituation of the men on whom the free &s;uffrages of their fellow citizens may confer the repre&s;entative tru&s;t, we &s;hall find it involving every &s;ecurity which can be devi&s;ed or de&s;ired for their fidelity to their con&s;tituents.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, as they will have been di&s;tin|gui&s;hed by the preference of their fellow citizens, we are to pre&s;ume, that in general, they will be &s;ome|what di&s;tingui&s;hed al&s;o, by tho&s;e qualities which entitle them to it, and which promi&s;e a &s;incere and &s;crupulous regard to the nature of their en|gagements.</P>
<P>In the &s;econd place, they will enter into the public &s;ervice under circum&s;tances which cannot fail to produce a temporary affection at lea&s;t to their con&s;tituents. There is in every brea&s;t a &s;en&s;ibility to marks of honour, of favour, of e&s;teem, and of con|fidence, which, apart from all con&s;iderations of intere&s;ts, is &s;ome pledge for grateful and benevolent returns. Ingratitude is a common topic of decla|mation again&s;t human nature; and it mu&s;t be con|fe&s;&s;ed,
<PB N="155" REF="021127_0392_0FB2477F104DBC90">
that in&s;tances of it are but too frequent and flagrant both in public and in private life. But the univer&s;al and extreme indignation which it in&s;pires, is it&s;elf a proof of the energy and preva|lence of the contrary &s;entiment.</P>
<P>In the third place, tho&s;e ties which bind the repre|&s;entative to his con&s;tituents are &s;trengthened by motives of a more &s;elfi&s;h nature. His pride and vanity attach him to a form of government which favors his preten&s;ions, and gives him a &s;hare in its honors and di&s;tinctions. Whatever hopes or projects might be entertained by a few a&s;piring characters, it mu&s;t generally happen that a great proportion of the men deriving their advancement from their influ|ence with the people, would have more to hope from a pre&s;ervation of the favor, than from inno|vations in the government &s;ubver&s;ive of the autho|rity of the people.</P>
<P>All the&s;e &s;ecurities however would be found very in&s;ufficient without the re&s;traint of frequent elections. Hence, in the fourth place, the hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives is &s;o con&s;tituted as to &s;upport in the members an habitual recollection of their dependence on the people. Before the &s;entiments impre&s;&s;ed on their minds by the mode of their elevation, can be effaced by the exerci&s;e of power, they will be compelled to anticipate the moment when their power is to cea&s;e, when their exerci&s;e of it is to be reviewed, and when they mu&s;t de&s;cend to the level from which they were rai&s;ed; there for ever to remain, unle&s;s a faithful di&s;charge of their tru&s;t &s;hall have e&s;tabli&s;hed their title to a renewal of it.</P>
<P>I will add as a fifth circum&s;tance in the &s;ituation of the hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives, re&s;training them from oppre&s;&s;ive mea&s;ures, that they can make no law which will not have its full operation on them|&s;elves and their friends, as well as on the great ma&s;s of the &s;ociety. This has always been deemed one of the &s;tronge&s;t bonds by which human policy can
<PB N="156" REF="021127_0393_0FB2478129FBD550">
connect the rulers and the people together. It creates between them that communion of intere&s;t and &s;ym|pathy of &s;entiments of which few governments have furni&s;hed examples; but without which every government degenerates into tyranny. If it be a&s;ked what is to re&s;train the hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives from making legal di&s;criminations in favor of them|&s;elves and a particular cla&s;s of the &s;ociety? I an&s;wer, the genius of the whole &s;y&s;tem, the nature of ju&s;t and con&s;titutional laws, and above all the vigilant and manly &s;pirit which actuates the people of Ame|rica, a &s;pirit which nouri&s;hes freedom, and in return is nouri&s;hed by it.</P>
<P>If this &s;pirit &s;hall ever be &s;o far deba&s;ed as to tolerate a law not obligatory on the legi&s;lature as well as on the people, the people will be prepared to tolerate any thing but liberty.</P>
<P>Such will be the relation between the hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives and their con&s;tituents. Duty, gra|titude, intere&s;t, ambition it&s;elf, are the cords by which they will be bound to fidelity and &s;ympathy with the great ma&s;s of the people. It is po&s;&s;ible that the&s;e may all be in&s;ufficient to control the caprice and wickedne&s;s of men. But are they not all that government will admit, and that human prudence can devi&s;e? Are they not the genuine and the characteri&s;tic means by which republican govern|ment provides for the liberty and happine&s;s of the people? Are they not the indentical means on which every &s;tate government in the union, relies for the attainment of the&s;e important ends? What then are we to under&s;tand by the objection which this paper has combated? What are we to &s;ay to the men who profe&s;s the mo&s;t flaming zeal for republican government, yet boldly impeach the fundamental principle of it; who pretend to be champions for the right and the capacity of the people to chu&s;e their own rulers, yet maintain that they will prefer tho&s;e only
<PB N="157" REF="021127_0394_0FB24786F0211350">
who will immediately and infallibly betray the tru&s;t committed to them?</P>
<P>Were the objection to be read by one who had not &s;een the mode pre&s;cribed by the con&s;titution for the choice of repre&s;entatives, he could &s;uppo&s;e nothing le&s;s than that &s;ome unrea&s;onable qualification of property was annexed to the right of &s;uffrage; or that the right of eligibility was limited to per&s;ons of particular families or fortunes; or at lea&s;t that the mode pre&s;cribed by the &s;tate con&s;titutions was in &s;ome re&s;pect or other very gro&s;sly departed from. We have &s;een how far &s;uch a &s;uppo&s;ition would err as to the two fir&s;t points. Nor would it in fact be le&s;s erroneous as to the la&s;t. The only difference di&s;coverable between the two ca&s;es is, that each repre&s;entative of the United States will be elected by five or &s;ix thou&s;and citizens; whil&s;t in the indi|vidual &s;tates the election of a repre&s;entative is left to about as many hundred. Will it be pretended that this difference is &s;ufficient to ju&s;tify an attach|ment to the &s;tate governments and an abhorrence to the federal government? If this be the point on which the objection turns it de&s;erves to be examined.</P>
<P>Is it &s;upported by <HI>rea&s;on?</HI> This cannot be &s;aid, without maintaining that five or &s;ix thou&s;and citizens are le&s;s capable of chu&s;ing a fit repre&s;entative, or more liable to be corrupted by an unfit one, than five or &s;ix hundred. Rea&s;on, on the contrary a&s;&s;ures us, that as in &s;o great a number, a fit repre&s;enta|tive would be mo&s;t likely to be found, &s;o the choice would be le&s;s likely to be diverted from him, by the intrigues of the ambitious, or the bribes of the rich.</P>
<P>Is the <HI>con&s;equence</HI> from this doctrine admi&s;&s;ible? If we &s;ay that five or &s;ix hundred citizens are as many as can jointly exerci&s;e their right of &s;uffrage, mu&s;t we not deprive the people of the immediate choice of their public &s;ervants in every in&s;tance where the admi|ni&s;tration of the government does not require as many
<PB N="158" REF="021127_0395_0FB24788A86F70C0">
of them as will amount to one for that number of citizens?</P>
<P>Is the doctrine warranted by <HI>facts?</HI> It was &s;hewn in the la&s;t paper, that the real repre&s;entation in the Briti&s;h hou&s;e of commons very little exceeds the pro|portion of one for every thirty thou&s;and inhabitants. Be&s;ides a variety of powerful cau&s;es, not exi&s;ting here and which favor in that country, the preten&s;ions of rank and wealth, no per&s;on is eligible as a repre&s;en|tative of a county, unle&s;s he po&s;&s;e&s;s real e&s;tate of the clear value of &s;ix hundred pounds &s;terling per year; nor of a city or borough, unle&s;s he po&s;&s;e&s;s a like e&s;tate of half that annual value. To this qualification on the part of the county repre&s;entatives, is added another on the part of the county electors, which re&s;trains the right of &s;uffrage to per&s;ons having a freehold e&s;tate of the annual value of more than twenty pounds &s;terling, according to the pre&s;ent rate of money. Notwith|&s;tanding the&s;e unfavourable circum&s;tances, and not|with&s;tanding &s;ome very unequal laws in the Briti&s;h code, it cannot be &s;aid that the repre&s;entatives of the nation have elevated the few on the ruins of the many.</P>
<P>But we need not re&s;ort to foreign experience on this &s;ubject. Our own is explicit and deci&s;ive. The di&s;tricts in New-Hamp&s;hire in which the &s;enators are cho&s;en immediately by the people, are nearly as large as will be nece&s;&s;ary for her repre&s;entatives in the congre&s;s. Tho&s;e of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts are larger than will be nece&s;&s;ary for that purpo&s;e. And tho&s;e of New-York &s;till more &s;o. In the la&s;t &s;tate the members of a&s;&s;embly, for the cities and counties of New-York and Albany, are elected by very nearly as many voters as will be entitled to a repre&s;entative in the congre&s;s, calculating on the number of &s;ixty-five repre&s;entatives only. It makes no difference that in the&s;e &s;enatorial di&s;tricts and counties, a number of repre&s;entatives are voted for by each elector at the &s;ame time. If the &s;ame electors, at the &s;ame time, are capable of
<PB N="159" REF="021127_0396_0FB2478A30123E70">
choo&s;ing four or five repre&s;entatives, they cannot be incapable of choo&s;ing one. Penn&s;ylvania is an addi|tional example. Some of her counties which elect her &s;tate repre&s;entatives, are almo&s;t as large as her di&s;tricts will be by which her federal repre&s;entatives will be elected. The city of Philadelphia is &s;uppo&s;ed to contain between fifty and &s;ixty thou&s;and &s;ouls. It will therefore form nearly two di&s;tricts for the choice of federal repre&s;entatives. It forms however but one county, in which every elector votes for each of its repre&s;entatives in the &s;tate legi&s;lature. And what may appear to be &s;till more directly to our purpo&s;e, the whole city actually elects a <HI>&s;ingle member</HI> for the executive council. This is the ca&s;e in all the other counties of the &s;tate.</P>
<P>Are not the&s;e facts the mo&s;t &s;atisfactory proofs of the fallacy which has been employed again&s;t the branch of the federal government under con&s;ideration? Has it appeared on trial that the &s;enators of New-Hamp&s;hire, Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts and New-York; or the executive council of Penn&s;ylvania; or the members of the a&s;&s;embly in the two la&s;t &s;tates, have betrayed any peculiar di&s;po&s;ition to &s;acrifice the many to the few; or are in any re&s;pect le&s;s worthy of their places than the repre&s;entatives and magi&s;trates appointed in other &s;tates, by very &s;mall divi&s;ions of the people?</P>
<P>But there are ca&s;es of a &s;tronger complexion than any which I have yet quoted. One branch of the legi&s;lature of Connecticut is &s;o con&s;tituted that each member of it is elected by the whole &s;tate. So is the governor of that &s;tate, of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, and of this &s;tate, and the pre&s;ident of New-Hamp&s;hire. I leave every man to decide whether the re&s;ult of any one of the&s;e experiments can be &s;aid to countenance a &s;u&s;picion that a diffu&s;ive mode of chu&s;ing repre&s;en|tatives of the people tends to elevate traitors, and to undermine the public liberty.</P>

<HEAD>NUMBER LVIII. The &s;ame Subject continued in Relation to the future augmentation of the Members.</HEAD>
<P>THE remaining charge again&s;t the hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives which I am to examine, is grounded on a &s;uppo&s;ition that the number of members will not be augmented from time to time, as the progre&s;s of population may demand.</P>
<P>It has been admitted that this objection, if well &s;upported, would have great weight. The follow|ing ob&s;ervations will &s;hew that like mo&s;t other objections again&s;t the con&s;titution, it can only proceed from a partial view of the &s;ubject; or from a jealou&s;y which di&s;colours and disfigures every object which is beheld.</P>
<P N="1">1. Tho&s;e who urge the objection &s;eem not to have recollected that the federal con&s;titution will not &s;uffer by a compari&s;on with the &s;tate con&s;titutions, in the &s;ecurity provided for a gradual augmentation of the number of repre&s;entatives. The number which is to prevail in the fir&s;t in&s;tance is declared to be temporary. Its duration is limited to the &s;hort term of three years.</P>
<P>Within every &s;ucce&s;&s;ive term of ten years, a cen&s;us of inhabitants is to be repeated. The unequivocal objects of the&s;e regulations are, fir&s;t, to re-adju&s;t from time to time the apportionment of repre&s;entatives to the number of inhabitants; under the &s;ingle exception that each &s;tate &s;hall have one repre&s;entative at lea&s;t: Secondly, to augment the number of repre&s;entatives at the &s;ame periods; under the &s;ole limitation, that the whole number &s;hall not exceed one for every thirty thou&s;and inhabitants. If we review the con|&s;titutions of the &s;everal &s;tates, we &s;hall find that &s;ome of them contain no determinate regulations on this &s;ubject; that others corre&s;pond pretty much on this
<PB N="161" REF="021127_0398_0FB2478D432275B0">
point with the federal con&s;titution; and that the mo&s;t effectual &s;ecurity in any of them is re&s;olvable into a mere directory provi&s;ion.</P>
<P N="2">2. As far as experience has taken place on this &s;ubject, a gradual increa&s;e of repre&s;entatives under the &s;tate con&s;titutions, has at lea&s;t kept pace with that of the con&s;tituents; and it appears that the former have been as ready to concur in &s;uch mea&s;ures, as the latter have been to call for them.</P>
<P N="3">3. There is a peculiarity in the federal con&s;titution which en&s;ures a watchful attention in a majority both of the people and of their repre&s;entatives, to a con|&s;titutional augmentation of the latter. The pecu|liarity lies in this, that one branch of the legi&s;lature is a repre&s;entation of citizens; the other of the &s;tates: In the former, con&s;equently the larger &s;tates will have mo&s;t weight; in the latter, the advantage will be in favor of the &s;maller &s;tates. From this circum&s;tance it may with certainty be inferred, that the larger &s;tates will be &s;trenuous advocates for increa&s;ing the number and weight of that part of the legi&s;lature in which their influence predominates. And it &s;o happens that four only of the large&s;t, will have a majority of the whole votes in the hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives. Should the repre&s;entatives or people therefore of the &s;maller &s;tates oppo&s;e at any time a rea&s;onable addition of members, a coalition of a very few &s;tates will be &s;uf|ficient to overrule the oppo&s;ition; a coalition, which notwith&s;tanding the rival&s;hip and local prejudices which might prevent it on ordinary occa&s;ions, would not fail to take place, when not merely prompted by common intere&s;t but ju&s;tified by equity and the principles of the con&s;titution.</P>
<P>It may be alledged, perhaps, that the &s;enate would be prompted by like motives to an adver&s;e coalition; and as their concurrence would be indi&s;|pen&s;able, the ju&s;t and con&s;titutional views of the other branch might be defeated. This is the diffi|culty which has probably created the mo&s;t &s;erious
<PB N="162" REF="021127_0399_0FB2479308D4BA18">
apprehen&s;ions in the jealous friends of a numerous repre&s;entation. Fortunately it is among the difficul|ties which, exi&s;ting only in appearance, vani&s;h on a clo&s;e and accurate in&s;pection. The following reflec|tions will, if I mi&s;take not, be admitted to be con|clu&s;ive and &s;atisfactory on this point.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the equal authority which will &s;ub&s;i&s;t between the two hou&s;es on all legi&s;lative &s;ubjects, except the originating of money bills, it cannot be doubted that the hou&s;e compo&s;ed of the greater number of members, when &s;upported by the more powerful &s;tates, and &s;peaking the known and determined &s;en&s;e of a majority of the people, will have no &s;mall advantage in a que&s;tion depending on the comparative firmne&s;s of the two hou&s;es.</P>
<P>This advantage mu&s;t be increa&s;ed by the con&s;ci|ou&s;ne&s;s felt by the &s;ame &s;ide, of being &s;upported in its demands, by right, by rea&s;on, and by the con|&s;titution; and the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide, of contending again&s;t the force of all the&s;e &s;olemn con&s;iderations.</P>
<P>It is farther to be con&s;idered that in the gradation between the &s;malle&s;t and large&s;t &s;tates, there are &s;everal which, though mo&s;t likely in general to arrange them&s;elves among the former, are too little removed in extent and population from the latter, to &s;econd an oppo&s;ition to their ju&s;t and legitimate preten&s;ions. Hence it is by no means certain that a majority of votes, even in the &s;enate; would be unfriendly to proper augmentations in the number of repre&s;entatives.</P>
<P>It will not be looking too far to add, that the &s;enators from all the new &s;tates may be gained over to the ju&s;t views of the hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives, by an expedient too obvious to be overlooked. As the&s;e &s;tates will for a great length of time advance in population with peculiar rapidity, they will be inter|e&s;ted in frequent re-apportionments of the repre&s;en|tatives to the number of inhabitants. The large &s;tates
<PB N="163" REF="021127_0400_0FB247966A751848">
therefore, who will prevail in the hou&s;e of repre&s;en|tatives, will have nothing to do, but to make re|apportionments and augmentations mutually condi|tions of each other; and the &s;enators from all the mo&s;t growing &s;tates will be bound to contend for the latter, by the intere&s;t which their &s;tates will feel in the former.</P>
<P>The&s;e con&s;iderations &s;eem to afford ample &s;ecurity on this &s;ubject; and ought alone to &s;atisfy all the doubts and fears which have been indulged with regard to it. Admitting however, that they &s;hould all be in&s;ufficient to &s;ubdue the unju&s;t policy of the &s;maller &s;tates, or their predominant influence in the councils of the &s;enate; a con&s;titutional and infalli|ble re&s;ource &s;till remains with the larger &s;tates, by which they will be able at all times to accompli&s;h their ju&s;t purpo&s;es. The hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives can not only refu&s;e, but they alone can propo&s;e the &s;upplies requi&s;ite for the &s;upport of government. They in a word hold the pur&s;e; that powerful in&s;tru|ment by which we behold in the hi&s;tory of the Briti&s;h con&s;titution, an infant and humble repre&s;entation of the people, gradually enlarging the &s;phere of its activity and importance, and finally reducing, as far as it &s;eems to have wi&s;hed, all the overgrown prerogatives of the other branches of the govern|ment. This power over the pur&s;e, may in fact be regarded as the mo&s;t compleat and effectual weapon with which any con&s;titution can arm the immediate repre&s;entatives of the people, for obtaining a redre&s;s of every grievance, and for carrying into effect every ju&s;t and &s;alutary mea&s;ure.</P>
<P>But will not the hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives be as much intere&s;ted as the &s;enate in maintaining the government in its proper functions, and will they not therefore be unwilling to &s;take its exi&s;tence for its reputation on the pliancy of the &s;enate? Or if &s;uch a trial of firmne&s;s between the two branches were hazarded, would not the one be as likely fir&s;t
<PB N="164" REF="021127_0401_0FB24B862FF661A0">
to yield as the other? The&s;e que&s;tions will create no difficulty with tho&s;e who reflect, that in all ca&s;es the &s;maller the number and the more permanent and con&s;picuous the &s;tation of men in power, the &s;tronger mu&s;t be the intere&s;t which they will individually feel in whatever concerns the government. Tho&s;e who repre&s;ent the dignity of their country in the eyes of other nations, will be particularly &s;en&s;ible to every pro&s;pect of public danger or of a di&s;honorable &s;tag|nation in public affairs. To tho&s;e cau&s;es we are to a&s;cribe the continual triumph of the Briti&s;h hou&s;e of commons over the other branches of the government, whenever the engine of a money bill has been em|ployed. An ab&s;olute inflexibility on the &s;ide of the latter, although it could not have failed to involve every department of the &s;tate in the general confu|&s;ion, has neither been apprehended nor experienced. The utmo&s;t degree of firmne&s;s that can be di&s;played by the federal &s;enate or pre&s;ident will not be more than equal to a re&s;i&s;tance in which they will be &s;up|ported by con&s;titutional and patriotic principles.</P>
<P>In this review of the con&s;titution of the hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives, I have pa&s;&s;ed over the circum&s;tance of economy, which in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of affairs might have had &s;ome effect in le&s;&s;ening the tempo|rary number of repre&s;entatives; and a di&s;regard of which would probably have been as rich a theme of declamation again&s;t the con&s;titution as has been furni&s;hed by the &s;mallne&s;s of the number propo&s;ed. I omit al&s;o any remarks on the difficulty which might be found, under pre&s;ent circum&s;tances, in engaging in the federal &s;ervice, a large number of &s;uch characters as the people will probably elect. One ob&s;ervation however, I mu&s;t be permitted to add on this &s;ubject, as claiming in my judgment a very &s;erious attention. It is, that in all legi&s;lative a&s;&s;emblies, the greater the number compo&s;ing them may be, the fewer will be the men who will in fact direct their proceedings. In the fir&s;t place, the
<PB N="165" REF="021127_0402_0FB24B87B64032E8">
more numerous any a&s;&s;embly may be, of whatever characters compo&s;ed, the greater is known to be the a&s;cendancy of pa&s;&s;ion over rea&s;on. In the next place, the larger the number, the greater will be the pro|portion of members of limited information and of weak capacities. Now it is preci&s;ely on characters of this de&s;cription that the eloquence and addre&s;s of the few are known to act with all their force. In the antient republics, where the whole body of the people a&s;&s;embled in per&s;on, a &s;ingle orator, or an artful &s;tate&s;man, was generally &s;een to rule with as compleat a &s;way, as if a &s;ceptre had been placed in his &s;ingle hands. On the &s;ame principle the more multitudinous a repre&s;entative a&s;&s;embly may be ren|dered&punc; the more it will partake of the infirmities incident to collective meetings of the people. Igno|rance will be the dupe of cunning; and pa&s;&s;ion the &s;lave of &s;ophi&s;try and declamation. The people can never err more than in &s;uppo&s;ing that by multiplying their repre&s;entatives beyond a certain limit, they &s;trengthen the barrier again&s;t the government of a few. Experience will forever admoni&s;h them that on the contrary, <HI>after &s;ecuring a &s;ufficient number for the purpo&s;es of &s;afety, of local information, and of diffu|&s;ive &s;ympathy with the whole &s;ociety,</HI> they will coun|teract their own views by every addition to their repre&s;entatives. The countenance of the govern|ment may become more democratic; but the &s;oul that animates it will be more oligarchic. The ma|chine will be enlarged, but the fewer, and often the more &s;ecret, will be the &s;prings by which its motions are directed.</P>
<P>As connected with the objection again&s;t the number of repre&s;entatives, may properly be here noticed, that which has been &s;ugge&s;ted again&s;t the number made competent for legi&s;lative bu&s;ine&s;s. It has been &s;aid that more than a majority ought to have been required for a quorum, and in particular ca&s;es, if not in all, more than a majority of a quorum for a deci&s;ion.
<PB N="166" REF="021127_0403_0FB24B89CDCD91C0">
That &s;ome advantages might have re&s;ulted from &s;uch a precaution, cannot be denied. It might have been an additional &s;hield to &s;ome particular intere&s;ts, and another ob&s;tacle generally to ha&s;ty and partial mea&s;ures. But the&s;e con&s;iderations are outweighed by the inconveniencies in the oppo&s;ite &s;cale. In all ca&s;es where ju&s;tice or the general good might require new laws to be pa&s;&s;ed, or active mea&s;ures to be pur&s;ued, the fundamental principle of free government would be rever&s;ed. It would be no longer the majority that would rule; the power would be transferred to the minority. Were the defen&s;ive privilege limited to particular ca&s;es, an intere&s;ted minority might take advantage of it to &s;kreen them&s;elves from equitable &s;acrifices to the general weal, or in particular emer|gencies to extort unrea&s;onable indulgences. La&s;tly, it would facilitate and fo&s;ter the baneful practice of &s;ece&s;&s;ions; a practice which has &s;hewn it&s;elf even in &s;tates where a majority only is required; a practice &s;ubver&s;ive of all the principles of order and regular government; a practice which leads more directly to public convul&s;ions, and the ruin of popular governments, than any other which has yet been di&s;played among us.</P>

<HEAD>NUMBER LIX. Concerning the Regulation of Elections.</HEAD>
<P>THE natural order of the &s;ubject leads us to con|&s;ider in this place, that provi&s;ion of the con|&s;titution which authori&s;es the national legi&s;lature to regulate in the la&s;t re&s;ort the election of its own members. It is in the&s;e words&mdash;
<Q>The <HI>times, places</HI> and <HI>manner</HI> of holding elections for &s;enators and repre&s;entatives, &s;hall be pre&s;cribed in each &s;tate

This provi&s;ion has not only been declaimed again&s;t by tho&s;e who condemn the con&s;titution in the gro&s;s; but it has been cen&s;ured by tho&s;e, who have objected with le&s;s latitude and greater moderation; and in one in&s;tance, it has been thought exceptionable by a gentleman who has declared him&s;elf the advocate of every other part of the &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>I am greatly mi&s;taken, notwith&s;tanding, if there be any article in the whole plan more completely defen&s;ible than this. Its propriety re&s;ts upon the evidence of this plain propo&s;ition, that <HI>every govern|ment ought to contain in it&s;elf the means of its own pre|&s;ervation.</HI> Every ju&s;t rea&s;oner will at fir&s;t &s;ight approve an adherence to this rule in the work of the convention; and will di&s;approve every deviation from it, which may not appear to have been dictated by the nece&s;&s;ity of incorporating into the work &s;ome particular ingredient, with which a rigid conformity to the rule was incompatible. Even in this ca&s;e, though he may acquie&s;ce in the nece&s;&s;ity, yet he will not cea&s;e to regard a departure from &s;o fundamental a principle, as a portion of imperfection in the &s;y&s;tem which may prove the feed of future weakne&s;s and perhaps anarchy.</P>
<P>It will not be alledged than an election law could have been framed and in&s;erted into the con&s;titution, which would have been applicable to every probable change in the &s;ituation of the country; and it will therefore not be denied that a di&s;cretionary power over elections ought to exi&s;t &s;omewhere. It will, I pre&s;ume, be as readily conceded, that there were only three ways, in which this power could have been rea&s;onably modified and di&s;po&s;ed, that it mu&s;t either have been lodged wholly in the national legi&s;lature, or wholly in the &s;tate legi&s;latures, or primarily in
<PB N="168" REF="021127_0405_0FB24B90218BA968">
the latter, and ultimately in the former. The la&s;t mode has with rea&s;on been preferred by the con|vention. They have &s;ubmitted the regulation of elections for the federal government in the fir&s;t in&s;tance to the local admini&s;trations; which in ordinary ca&s;es, and when no improper views prevail, may be both more convenient and more &s;atisfactory; but they have re&s;erved to the national authority a right to interpo&s;e, whenever extraordinary circum|&s;tances might render that interpo&s;ition nece&s;&s;ary to its &s;afety.</P>
<P>Nothing can be more evident, than that an exclu|&s;ive power of regulating elections for the national government, in the hands of the &s;tate legi&s;latures, would leave the exi&s;tence of the union entirely at their mercy. They could at any moment annihilate it, by neglecting to provide for the choice of per&s;ons to admini&s;ter its affairs. It is to little purpo&s;e to &s;ay that a neglect or omi&s;&s;ion of this kind, would not be likely to take place. The con&s;titutional po&s;&s;ibility of the thing, without an equivalent for the ri&s;k, is an unan&s;werable objection. Nor has any &s;atisfactory rea&s;on been yet a&s;&s;igned for incurring that ri&s;k. The extravagant &s;urmi&s;es of a di&s;tempered jealou&s;y can never be dignified with that character. If we are in a humour to pre&s;ume abu&s;es of power, it is as fair to pre&s;ume them on the part of the &s;tate govern|ments, as on the part of the general government. And as it is more con&s;onant to the rules of a ju&s;t theory to intru&s;t the union with the care of its own exi&s;tence, than to transfer that care to any other hands; if abu&s;es of power are to be hazarded on the one &s;ide or on the other, it is more rational to hazard them where the power would naturally be placed, than where it would unnaturally be placed.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e an article had been introduced into the con&s;titution, empowering the United States to regu|late the elections for the particular &s;tates, would any man have he&s;itated to condemn it, both as an un|warrantable
<PB N="169" REF="021127_0406_0FB24B916A7A2158">
tran&s;po&s;ition of power, and as a preme|ditated engine for the de&s;truction of the &s;tate govern|ments? The violation of principle in this ca&s;e would have required no comment; and to an unbia&s;&s;ed ob&s;erver, it will not be le&s;s apparent in the project of &s;ubjecting the exi&s;tence of the national govern|ment, in a &s;imilar re&s;pect to the plea&s;ure of the &s;tate governments. An impartial view of the matter cannot fail to re&s;ult in a conviction, that each, as far as po&s;&s;ible ought to depend on it&s;elf for its own pre&s;ervation.</P>
<P>As an objection to this po&s;ition, it may be remarked that the con&s;titution of the national &s;enate, would involve in its full extent the danger which it is &s;ugge&s;ted might flow from an exclu&s;ive power in the &s;tate legi&s;latures to regulate the federal elections. It may be alledged, that by declining the appointment of &s;enators, they might at any time give a fatal blow to the union; and from this it may be infered, that as its exi&s;tence would be thus rendered dependent upon them in &s;o e&s;&s;ential a point, there can be no ob|jection to entru&s;ting them with it, in the particular ca&s;e under con&s;ideration. The intere&s;t of each &s;tate, it may be added, to maintain its repre&s;entation in the national councils, would be a complete &s;ecurity again&s;t an abu&s;e of the tru&s;t.</P>
<P>This argument, though &s;pecious, will not upon examination be found &s;olid. It is certainly true, that the &s;tate legi&s;latures, by forbearing the appointment of &s;enators, may de&s;troy the national government. But it will not follow, that becau&s;e they have the power to do this in one in&s;tance, they ought to have it in every other. There are ca&s;es in which the per|nicious tendency of &s;uch a power may be far more deci&s;ive, without any motive, equally cogent with that which mu&s;t have regulated the conduct of the con|vention, in re&s;pect to the con&s;truction of the &s;enate, to recommend their admi&s;&s;ion into the &s;y&s;tem. So far as that con&s;truction may expo&s;e the union to the
<PB N="170" REF="021127_0407_0FB24B92E3DB8120">
po&s;&s;ibility of injury from the &s;tate legi&s;latures, it is an evil; but it is an evil, which could not have been avoided without excluding the &s;tates, in their political capacities, wholly from a place in the organization of the national government. If this had been done, it would doubtle&s;s have been interpreted into an entire dereliction of the federal principle; and would cer|tainly have deprived the &s;tate governments of that ab&s;olute &s;afe-guard, which they will enjoy under this provi&s;ion. But however wi&s;e it may have been, to have &s;ubmitted in this in&s;tance to an inconvenience, for the attainment of a nece&s;&s;ary advantage or a greater good, no inference can be drawn from thence to favor an accumulation of the evil, where no nece&s;&s;ity urges, nor any greater good invites.</P>
<P>It may ea&s;ily be di&s;cerned al&s;o, that the national government would run a much greater ri&s;k from a power in the &s;tate legi&s;latures over the elections of its hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives, than from their power of appointing the members of its &s;enate. The &s;enators are to be cho&s;en for the period of &s;ix years; there is to be a rotation, by which the &s;eats of a third part of them are to be vacated, and repleni&s;hed every two years; and no &s;tate is to be entitled to more than two &s;enators: A quorum of the body is to con&s;i&s;t of &s;ix|teen members. The joint re&s;ult of the&s;e circum&s;tances would be, that a temporary combination of a few &s;tates, to intermit the appointment of &s;enators, could neither annul the exi&s;tence nor impair the activity of the body: And it is not from a general and per|manent combination of the &s;tates, that we can have any thing to fear. The fir&s;t might proceed from &s;ini&s;ter de&s;igns in the leading members of a few of the &s;tate legi&s;latures; the la&s;t would &s;uppo&s;e a fixed and rooted di&s;affection in the great body of the people; which will either never exi&s;t at all, or will in all probability proceed from an experience of the inaptitude of the general government to the advance|ment
<PB N="171" REF="021127_0408_0FB24B9B288B0358">
of their happine&s;s; in which event no good citizen could de&s;ire its continuance.</P>
<P>But with regard to the federal hou&s;e of repre&s;en|tatives, there is intended to be a general election of members once in two years. If the &s;tate legi&s;latures were to be inve&s;ted with an exclu&s;ive power of regu|lating the&s;e elections, every period of making them would be a delicate cri&s;is in the national &s;ituation; which might i&s;&s;ue in a di&s;&s;olution of the union, if the leaders of a few of the mo&s;t important &s;tates &s;hould have entered into a previous con&s;piracy to prevent an election.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not deny that there is a degree of weight in the ob&s;ervation, that the intere&s;t of each &s;tate to be repre&s;ented in the federal councils will be a &s;ecurity again&s;t the abu&s;e of a power over its elections in the hands of the &s;tate legi&s;latures. But the &s;ecurity will not be con&s;idered as complete, by tho&s;e who attend to the force of an obvious di&s;tinction between the intere&s;ts of the people in the public felicity, and the intere&s;t of their local rulers in the power and con&s;equence of their offices. The people of America may be warmly attached to the government of the union at times, when the particular rulers of particular &s;tates, &s;timulated by the natural rival&s;hip of power, and by the hopes of per&s;onal aggrandi&s;ement, and &s;upported by a &s;trong faction in each of tho&s;e &s;tates, may be in a very oppo&s;ite temper. This diver&s;ity of &s;entiment, between a majority of the people, and the individuals who have the greate&s;t credit, in their councils, is exemplified in &s;ome of the &s;tates, at the pre&s;ent moment, on the pre&s;ent que&s;tion. The &s;cheme of &s;eparate confederacies, which will always multiply the chances of ambition, will be a never failing bait to all &s;uch influential characters in the &s;tate admi|ni&s;trations as are capable of preferring their own emolument and advancement to the public weal. With &s;o effectual a weapon in their hands as the exclu&s;ive power of regulating elections for the national

It ought never to be forgotten, that a firm union of this country, under an efficient government, will probably be an encrea&s;ing object of jealou&s;y to more than one nation of Europe; and that enterpri&s;es to &s;ubvert it will &s;ometimes originate in the intrigues of foreign powers, and will &s;eldom fail to be patroni&s;ed and abbetted by &s;ome of them. Its pre&s;ervation therefore ought in no ca&s;e, that can be avoided, to be com|mitted to the guardian&s;hip of any but tho&s;e, who&s;e &s;ituation will uniformly beget an immediate intere&s;t in the faithful and vigilant performance of the tr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;t.</P>

<P>WE have &s;een that an incontrolable power over the elections for the federal government could not, without hazard be committed to the &s;tate legi&s;|latures. Let us now &s;ee what would be the dangers on the other &s;ide; that is, from confiding the ultimate right of regulating its own elections to the union it&s;elf. It is not pretended, that this right would ever be u&s;ed for the exclu&s;ion of any &s;tate from its &s;hare in the repre&s;entation. The intere&s;t of all would in this re&s;pect at lea&s;t be the &s;ecurity of all. But it is alledged that it might be employed in &s;uch a manner as to promote the election of &s;ome favourite cla&s;s of men in
<PB N="173" REF="021127_0410_0FB24BA220EA3948">
exclu&s;ion of others; by confining the places of election to particular di&s;tricts, and rendering it impracticable to the citizens at large to partake in the choice. Of all chimerical &s;uppo&s;itions, this &s;eems to be the mo&s;t chimerical. On the one hand no rational calculation of probabilities would lead us to imagine, that the di&s;po&s;ition, which a conduct &s;o violent and extraor|dinary would imply, could ever find its way into the national councils; and on the other, it may be con|cluded with certainty, that if &s;o improper a &s;pirit &s;hould ever gain admittance into them, it would di&s;play it&s;elf in a form altogether different and far more deci&s;ive.</P>
<P>The improbability of the attempt may be &s;atisfac|torily inferred from this &s;ingle reflection, that it could never be made without cau&s;ing an immediate revolt of the great body of the people, headed and directed by the &s;tate governments. It is not difficult to con|ceive that this characteri&s;tic right of freedom may, in certain turbulent and factious &s;ea&s;ons, be violated in re&s;pect to a particular cla&s;s of citizens by a victo|rious majority; but that &s;o fundamental a privilege, in a country &s;ituated and enlightened as this is, &s;hould be invaded to the prejudice of the great ma&s;s of the people, by the deliberate policy of the government, without occa&s;ioning a popular revolution, is altogether inconceivable and incredible.</P>
<P>In addition to this general reflection, there are con&s;iderations of a more preci&s;e nature, which forbid all apprehen&s;ion on the &s;ubject. The di&s;&s;imilarity in the ingredients, which will compo&s;e the national go|vernment, and &s;till more in the manner in which they will be brought into action in its various branches, mu&s;t form a powerful ob&s;tacle to a concert of views, in any partial &s;cheme of elections. There is &s;ufficient diver&s;ity in the &s;tate of property, in the genius, man|ners, and habits of the people of the different parts of the union, to occa&s;ion a material diver&s;ity of di&s;|po&s;ition in their repre&s;entatives towards the different
<PB N="174" REF="021127_0411_0FB24BA371D76258">
ranks and conditions in &s;ociety. And though an intimate intercour&s;e under the &s;ame government will promote a gradual a&s;&s;imilation of temper and &s;enti|ments, yet there are cau&s;es as well phy&s;ical as moral, which may in a greater or le&s;s degree permanently nouri&s;h different propen&s;ities and inclinations in this particular. But the circum&s;tance which will be likely to have the greate&s;t influence in the matter, will be the di&s;&s;imilar modes of con&s;tituting the &s;everal com|ponent parts of the government. The hou&s;e of repre|&s;entatives being to be elected immediately by the people; the &s;enate by the &s;tate legi&s;latures; the pre|&s;ident by electors cho&s;en for that purpo&s;e by the people; there would be little probability of a com|mon intere&s;t to cement the&s;e different branches in a predilection for any particular cla&s;s of electors.</P>
<P>As to the &s;enate it is impo&s;&s;ible that any regulation of "time and manner," which is all that is propo&s;ed to be &s;ubmitted to the national government in re&s;pect to that body, can affect the &s;pirit which will direct the choice of its members. The collective &s;en&s;e of the &s;tate legi&s;latures can never be influenced by ex|traneous circum&s;tances of that &s;ort: A con&s;ideration which alone ought to &s;atisfy us that the di&s;crimination apprehended would never be attempted. For what inducement could the &s;enate have to concur in a pre|ference in which it&s;elf would not be included? Or to what purpo&s;e would it be e&s;tabli&s;hed in reference to one branch of the legi&s;lature, if it could not be ex|tended to the other? The compo&s;ition of the one would in this ca&s;e counteract that of the other. And we can never &s;uppo&s;e that it would embrace the appointments to the &s;enate, unle&s;s we can at the &s;ame time &s;uppo&s;e the voluntary co-operation of the &s;tate legi&s;latures. If we make the latter &s;uppo&s;ition, it then becomes immaterial where the power in que&s;tion is placed; whether in their hands or in tho&s;e of the union.</P>
<P><PB N="175" REF="021127_0412_0FB24BA4E4DFE160">But what is to be the object of this capricious par|tiality in the national councils? Is it to be exerci&s;ed in a di&s;crimination between the different departments of indu&s;try, or between the different kinds of pro|perty, or between the different degrees of property? Will it lean in favor of the landed intere&s;t, or the monied intere&s;t, or the mercantile intere&s;t, or the manufacturing intere&s;t? Or, to &s;peak in the fa&s;hion|able language of the adver&s;aries of the con&s;titution, will it court the elevation of the
<Q>wealthy and the well born</Q>
to the exclu&s;ion and deba&s;ement of all the re&s;t of the &s;ociety?</P>
<P>If this partiality is to be exerted in favour of tho&s;e who are concerned in any particular de&s;cription of indu&s;try or property, I pre&s;ume it will readily be admitted that the competition for it will lie between landed men and merchants. And I &s;cruple not to affirm, that it is infinitely le&s;s likely that either of them &s;hould gain an a&s;cendant in the national councils, than that the one or the other of them &s;hould predo|minate in all the local councils. The inference will be, that a conduct tending to give an undue pre|ference to either, is much le&s;s to be dreaded from the former than from the latter.</P>
<P>The &s;everal &s;tates are in various degrees addicted to agriculture and commerce. In mo&s;t, if not all of them, agriculture is predominant. In a few of them, however, commerce nearly divides its empire, and in mo&s;t of them has a con&s;iderable &s;hare of influence. In proportion as either prevails, it will be conveyed into the national repre&s;entation; and for the very rea&s;on that this will be an emanation from a greater variety of intere&s;ts, and in much more various pro|portions, than are to be found in any &s;ingle &s;tate, it will be much le&s;s apt to e&s;pou&s;e either of them, with a decided partiality, than the repre&s;entation of any &s;ingle &s;tate.</P>
<P>In a country con&s;i&s;ting chiefly of the cultivators of land where the rules of an equal repre&s;entation
<PB N="176" REF="021127_0413_0FB24BAB5BF37CB0">
obtain the landed intere&s;t mu&s;t upon the whole pre|ponderate in the government. As long as this intere&s;t prevails in mo&s;t of the &s;tate legi&s;latures, &s;o long it mu&s;t maintain a corre&s;pondent &s;uperiority in the national &s;enate, which will generally be a faithful copy of the majorities of tho&s;e a&s;&s;emblies. It cannot therefore be pre&s;umed that a &s;acrifice of the landed to the mercantile cla&s;s will ever be a favorite object of this branch of the federal legi&s;lature. In applying thus particularly to the &s;enate a general ob&s;ervation &s;ugge&s;ted by the &s;ituation of the country, I am governed by the con&s;ideration, that the credulous votaries of &s;tate power, cannot upon their own prin|ciples &s;u&s;pect that the &s;tate legi&s;latures would be warped from their duty by any external influence. But as in reality the &s;ame &s;ituation mu&s;t have the &s;ame effect in the primitive compo&s;ition at lea&s;t of the federal hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives; an improper bya&s;s towards the mercantile cla&s;s is as little to be expected from this quarter or from the other.</P>
<P>In order perhaps to give countenance to the objec|tion at any rate, it may be a&s;ked, is there not danger of an oppo&s;ite bya&s;s in the national government, which may di&s;po&s;e it to endeavour to &s;ecure a mono|poly of the federal admini&s;tration to the landed cla&s;s? As there is little likelihood that the &s;uppo&s;ition of &s;uch a bya&s;s will have any terrors for tho&s;e who would be immediately injured by it, a laboured an&s;wer to this que&s;tion will be di&s;pen&s;ed with. It will be &s;ufficient to remark, fir&s;t, that for the rea&s;ons el&s;ewhere a&s;&s;igned, it is le&s;s likely that any decided partiality &s;hould prevail in the councils of the union than in tho&s;e of any of its members. Secondly that there would be no temptation to violate the con&s;ti|tution in favor of the landed cla&s;s, becau&s;e that cla&s;s would in the natural cour&s;e of things enjoy as great a preponderancy as it&s;elf could de&s;ire. And thirdly that men accu&s;tomed to inve&s;tigate the &s;ources of public pro&s;perity, upon a large &s;cale, mu&s;t be too well
<PB N="177" REF="021127_0414_0FB24BACF1A64FD8">
convinced of the utility of commerce, to be inclined to inflict upon it &s;o deep a wound as would be occa|&s;ioned by the entire exclu&s;ion of tho&s;e who would be&s;t under&s;tand its intere&s;ts from a &s;hare in the manage|ment of them. The importance of commerce in the view of revenue alone mu&s;t effectually guard it again&s;t the enmity of a body which would be con|tinually importuned in its favor by the urgent calls of public nece&s;&s;ity.</P>
<P>I the rather con&s;ult brevity in di&s;cu&s;&s;ing the pro|bability of a preference founded upon a di&s;crimination between the different kinds of indu&s;try and property, becau&s;e, as far as I under&s;tand the meaning of the objectors, they contemplate a di&s;crimination of another kind. They appear to have in view, as the objects of the preference with which they endeavour to alarm us, tho&s;e whom they de&s;ignate by the de&s;cription of the "wealthy and the well born." The&s;e, it &s;eems, are to be exalted to an odious pre-eminence over the re&s;t of their fellow citizens. At one time however their elevation is to be a nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence of the &s;mallne&s;s of the repre&s;entative body; at another time it is to be effected by depriving the people at large of the opportunity of exerci&s;ing their right of &s;uffrage in the choice of that body.</P>
<P>But upon what principle is the di&s;crimination of the places of election to be made in order to an&s;wer the purpo&s;e of the meditated preference? Are the wealthy and the well born, as they are called, con|fined to particular &s;pots in the &s;everal &s;tates? Have they by &s;ome miraculous in&s;tinct or fore&s;ight &s;et apart in each of them a common place of re&s;idence? Are they only to be met with in the towns and the cities? Or are they, on the contrary &s;cattered over the face of the country as avarice or chance may have happened to ca&s;t their own lot, or that of their pre|dece&s;&s;ors? If the latter is the ca&s;e, (as every intel|ligent man knows it to be<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Particularly in the Southern States and in this State.</NOTE>) is it not evident that the
<PB N="178" REF="021127_0415_0FB24BADE80A5208">
policy of confining the places of elections to par|ticular di&s;tricts would be as &s;ubver&s;ive of its own aim as it would be exceptionable on every other account? The truth is that there is no method of &s;ecuring to the rich the preference apprehended, but by pre|&s;cribing qualifications of property either for tho&s;e who may elect, or be elected. But this forms no part of the power to be conferred upon the national government. Its authority would be expre&s;sly re&s;tricted to the regulation of the <HI>times,</HI> the <HI>places,</HI> and the <HI>manner</HI> of elections. The qualifications of the per&s;ons who may choo&s;e or be cho&s;en, as has been remarked upon another occa&s;ion, are defined and fixed in the con&s;titution; and are unalterable by the legi&s;lature.</P>
<P>Let it however be admitted, for argument &s;ake, that the expedient &s;ugge&s;ted might be &s;ucce&s;sful; and let it at the &s;ame time be equally taken for granted that all the &s;cruples which a &s;en&s;e of duty or an appre|hen&s;ion of the danger of the experiment might in&s;pire, were overcome in the brea&s;ts of the national rulers; &s;till, I imagine, it will hardly be pretended, that they could ever hope to carry &s;uch an enterpri&s;e into exe|cution, without the aid of a military force &s;ufficient to &s;ubdue the re&s;i&s;tance of the great body of the people. The improbability of the exi&s;tence of a force equal to that object, has been di&s;cu&s;&s;ed and de|mon&s;trated in different parts of the&s;e papers; but that the futility of the objection under con&s;ideration may appear in the &s;tronge&s;t light, it &s;hall be conceded for a moment that &s;uch a force might exi&s;t; and the national government &s;hall be &s;uppo&s;ed to be in the actual po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it. What will be the conclu&s;ion? With a di&s;po&s;ition to invade the e&s;&s;ential rights of the community, and with the means of gratifying that di&s;po&s;ition, is it pre&s;umable that the per&s;ons who were actuated by it would amu&s;e them&s;elves in the ridiculous ta&s;k of fabricating election laws for &s;ecuring a preference to a favourite cla&s;s of men? Would they
<PB N="179" REF="021127_0416_0FB24BAF8F561DF0">
not be likely to prefer a conduct better adapted to their own immediate aggrandizement? Would they not rather boldly re&s;olve to perpetuate them&s;elves in office by one deci&s;ive act of u&s;urpation, than to tru&s;t to precarious expedients, which in &s;pite of all the precautions that might accompany them, might ter|minate in the di&s;mi&s;&s;ion, di&s;grace and ruin of their authors? Would they not fear that citizens not le&s;s tenacious than con&s;cious of their rights would flock from the remote&s;t extremes of their re&s;pective &s;tates to the places of election, to overthrow their tyrants, and to &s;ub&s;titute men who would be di&s;po&s;ed to avenge the violated maje&s;ty of the people?</P>

<P>THE more candid oppo&s;ers of the provi&s;ion re&s;pecting elections contained in the plan of the convention, when pre&s;&s;ed in argument, will &s;ome|times concede the propriety of that provi&s;ion; with this qualification however that it ought to have been accompanied with a declaration that all elections &s;hould be had in the counties where the electors re&s;ided. This &s;ay they, was a nece&s;&s;ary precaution again&s;t an abu&s;e of the power. A declaration of this nature, would certainly have been harmle&s;s: So far as it would have had the effect of quieting apprehen&s;ions, it might not have been unde&s;irable. But it would in fact have afforded little or no addi|tional &s;ecurity again&s;t the danger apprehended; and the want of it will never be con&s;idered by an impar|tial and judicious examiner as a &s;erious, &s;till le&s;s, as an in&s;uperable objection to the plan. The different views taken of the &s;ubject in the two preceding
<PB N="180" REF="021127_0417_0FB24BB66D3610F0">
papers mu&s;t be &s;ufficient to &s;atisfy all di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate and di&s;cerning men, that if the public liberty &s;hould ever be the victim of the ambition of the national rulers, the power under examination at lea&s;t will be guiltle&s;s of the &s;acrifice.</P>
<P>If tho&s;e who are inclined to con&s;ult their jealou&s;y only would exerci&s;e it in a careful in&s;pection of the &s;everal &s;tate con&s;titutions, they would find little le&s;s room for di&s;quietude and alarm from the latitude which mo&s;t of them allow in re&s;pect to elections, than from the latitude which is propo&s;ed to be allowed to the national government in the &s;ame re&s;pect. A re|view of their &s;ituation, in this particular, would tend greatly to remove any ill impre&s;&s;ions which may remain in regard to this matter. But as that review would lead into lengthy and tedious details, I &s;hall content my&s;elf with the &s;ingle example of the &s;tate in which I write. The con&s;titution of New-York makes no other provi&s;ion for <HI>locality</HI> of elections, than that the members of the a&s;&s;embly &s;hall be elected in the <HI>counties,</HI> tho&s;e of the &s;enate in the great di&s;tricts into which the &s;tate is or may be divided; the&s;e at pre&s;ent are four in number, and comprehend each from two to &s;ix counties. It may readily be perceived, that it would not be more difficult to the legi&s;lature of New-York to defeat the &s;uffrages of the citizens of New-York, by confining elections to particular places, than to the legi&s;lature of the United States to defeat the &s;uffrages of the citizens of the union, by the like ex|pedient. Suppo&s;e, for in&s;tance, the city of Albany was to be appointed the &s;ole place of election for the county and di&s;trict of which it is a part, would not the inhabitants of that city &s;peedily become the only electors of the members both of the &s;enate and a&s;&s;embly, for that county and di&s;trict? Can we ima|gine that the electors who re&s;ide in the remote &s;ubdi|vi&s;ions of the county of Albany, Saratoga, Cam|bridge, &amp;c. or in any part of the county of Mont|gomery, would take the trouble to come to the city
<PB N="181" REF="021127_0418_0FB24BB8C8830808">
of Albany to give their votes for members of the a&s;&s;embly or &s;enate, &s;ooner than they would repair to the city of New-York, to participate in the choice of the members of the federal hou&s;e of repre&s;enta|tives? The alarming indifference di&s;coverable in the exerci&s;e of &s;o invaluable a privilege under the exi&s;t|ing laws, which afford every facility to it, furni&s;hes a ready an&s;wer to this que&s;tion. And, ab&s;tracted from any experience on the &s;ubject, we can be at no lo&s;s to determine that when the place of election is at an <HI>inconvenient di&s;tance</HI> from the elector, the effect upon his conduct will be the &s;ame whether that di&s;|tance be twenty miles or twenty thou&s;and miles. Hence it mu&s;t appear that objections to the parti|cular modification of the federal power of regulating elections will in &s;ub&s;tance apply with equal force to the modification of the like power in the con&s;titution of this &s;tate; and for this rea&s;on it will be impo&s;&s;ible to acquit the one and to condemn the other. A &s;imilar compari&s;on would lead to the &s;ame conclu|&s;ion in re&s;pect to the con&s;titutions of mo&s;t of the other &s;tates.</P>
<P>If it &s;hould be &s;aid that defects in the &s;tate con&s;ti|tutions furni&s;h no apology for tho&s;e which are to be found in the plan propo&s;ed; I an&s;wer, that as the former have never been thought chargeable with in|attention to the &s;ecurity of liberty, where the im|putations thrown on the latter can be &s;hewn to be applicable to them al&s;o, the pre&s;umption is that they are rather the cavilling refinements of a predetermined oppo&s;ition, than the well founded inferences of a candid re&s;earch after truth. To tho&s;e who are di&s;|po&s;ed to con&s;ider, as innocent omi&s;&s;ions in the &s;tate con&s;titutions, what they regard as unpardonable blemi&s;hes in the plan of the convention, nothing can be &s;aid; or at mo&s;t they can only be a&s;ked to a&s;&s;ign &s;ome &s;ub&s;tantial rea&s;on why the repre&s;entatives of the people in a &s;ingle &s;tate &s;hould be more impregnable to the lu&s;t of power or other &s;ini&s;ter motives, than the
<PB N="182" REF="021127_0419_0FB24BBDE0950C98">
repre&s;entatives of the people of the United States? If they cannot do this, they ought at lea&s;t to prove to us, that it is ea&s;ier to &s;ubvert the liberties of three millions of people, with the advantage of local governments to head their oppo&s;ition, than of two hundred thou&s;and people, who are de&s;titute of that advantage. And in relation to the point immedi|ately under con&s;ideration, they ought to convince us that it is le&s;s probable a predominant faction in a &s;ingle &s;tate, &s;hould in order to maintain its &s;uperiority, incline to a preference of a particular cla&s;s of electors, than that a &s;imilar &s;pirit &s;hould take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the repre&s;entatives of thirteen &s;tates &s;pread over a va&s;t region, and in &s;everal re&s;pects di&s;tingui&s;hable from each other by a diver&s;ity of local circum&s;tances, pre|judices and intere&s;ts.</P>
<P>Hitherto my ob&s;ervations have only aimed at a vindication of the provi&s;ion in que&s;tion, on the ground of theoretic propriety, on that of the danger of placing the power el&s;ewhere, and on that of the &s;afety of placing it in the manner propo&s;ed. But there remains to be mentioned a po&s;itive advantage which will accrue from this di&s;po&s;ition, and which could not as well have been obtained from any other: I allude to the circum&s;tance of uniformity in the time of elec|tions for the federal hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives. It is more than po&s;&s;ible, that this uniformity may be found by experience to be of great importance to the public welfare; both as a &s;ecurity again&s;t the perpetuation of the &s;ame &s;pirit in the body, and as a cure for the di&s;ea&s;es of faction. If each &s;tate may choo&s;e its own time of election, it is po&s;&s;ible there may be at lea&s;t as many different periods as there are months in the year. The times of election in the &s;everal &s;tates as they are now e&s;tabli&s;hed for local purpo&s;es, vary between extremes as wide as March and November. The con&s;equence of this diver&s;ity would be, that there could never happen a total di&s;&s;olution or renovation of the body at one time. If an improper &s;pirit of
<PB N="183" REF="021127_0420_0FB24BBF31C05018">
any kind &s;hould happen to prevail in it, that &s;pirit would be apt to infu&s;e it&s;elf into the new members as they came forward in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. The ma&s;s would be likely to remain nearly the &s;ame; a&s;&s;imilating con|&s;tantly to it&s;elf its gradual accretions. There is a contagion in example which few men have &s;ufficient force of mind to re&s;i&s;t. I am inclined to think that treble the duration in office, with the con|dition of a total di&s;&s;olution of the body at the &s;ame time, might be le&s;s formidable to liberty, than one third of that duration &s;ubject to gradual and &s;ucce&s;&s;ive alterations.</P>
<P>Uniformity in the time of elections &s;eems not le&s;s requi&s;ite for executing the idea of a regular rotation in the &s;enate; and for conveniently a&s;&s;embling the legi&s;lature at a &s;tated period in each year.</P>
<P>It may be a&s;ked, why then could not a time have been fixed in the con&s;titution? As the mo&s;t zealous adver&s;aries of the plan of the convention in this &s;tate, are in general not le&s;s zealous admirers of the con&s;ti|tution of the &s;tate, the que&s;tion may be retorted, and it may be a&s;ked, why was not a time for the like purpo&s;e fixed in the con&s;titution of this &s;tate? No better an&s;wer can be given, than that it was a matter which might &s;afely be entru&s;ted to legi&s;lative di&s;cretion, and that if a time had been appointed, it might upon experiment have been found le&s;s con|venient than &s;ome other time. The &s;ame an&s;wer may be given to the que&s;tion put on the other &s;ide. And it may be added, that the &s;uppo&s;ed danger of a gradual change being merely &s;peculative, it would have been hardly advi&s;able upon that &s;peculation to e&s;tabli&s;h, as a fundamental point, what would deprive &s;everal &s;tates of the convenience of having the elec|tions for their own governments, and for the national government, at the &s;ame epoch.</P>

<HEAD>NUMBER LXII. Concerning the Con&s;titution of the Senate, with regard to the Qualifications of the Members, the Manner of appointing them, the Equality of Repre&s;entation, the Number of the Senators and the Duration of their Appointments.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING examined the con&s;titution of the hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives, and an&s;wered &s;uch of the objections again&s;t it as &s;eemed to merit notice&punc; I enter next on the examination of the &s;enate. The heads into which this member of the government may be con&s;idered, are&mdash;I. the qualifications of &s;enators&mdash;II. the appointment of them by the &s;tate legi&s;latures&mdash;III. the equality of repre&s;entation in the &s;enate&mdash;IV. the number of &s;enators, and the term for which they are to be elected&mdash;V. the powers ve&s;ted in the &s;enate.</P>
<P N="1">I. The qualifications propo&s;ed for &s;enators, as di&s;tingui&s;hed from tho&s;e of repre&s;entatives, con&s;i&s;t in a more advanced age, and a longer period of citi|zen&s;hip. A &s;enator mu&s;t be thirty years of age at lea&s;t; as a repre&s;entative, mu&s;t be twenty-five. And the former mu&s;t have been a citizen nine years; as &s;even years are required for the latter. The pro|priety of the&s;e di&s;tinctions is explained by the nature of the &s;enatorial tru&s;t; which requiring greater extent of information and &s;tability of character, requires at the &s;ame time that the &s;enator &s;hould have reached a period of life mo&s;t likely to &s;upply the&s;e advantages; and which participating immediately in tran&s;actions with foreign nations, ought to be exerci&s;ed by none who are not thoroughly weaned from the prepo&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ions and habits incident to foreign birth and educa|tion. The term of nine years appears to be a prudent
<PB N="185" REF="021127_0422_0FB24BC688AEC740">
mediocrity between a total exclu&s;ion of adopted citi|zens, who&s;e merit and talents may claim a &s;hare in the public confidence; and an indi&s;criminate and ha&s;ty admi&s;&s;ion of them, which might create a chan|nel for foreign influence on the national councils.</P>
<P N="2">II. It is equally unnece&s;&s;ary to dilate on the ap|pointment of &s;enators by the &s;tate legi&s;latures. Among the various modes which might have been devi&s;ed for con&s;tituting this branch of the govern|ment, that which has been propo&s;ed by the conven|tion is probably the mo&s;t congenial with the public opinion. It is recommended by the double advan|tage of favoring a &s;elect appointment, and of giving to the &s;tate governments &s;uch an agency in the for|mation of the federal government, as mu&s;t &s;ecure the authority of the former, and may form a convenient link between the two &s;y&s;tems.</P>
<P N="3">III. The equality of repre&s;entation in the &s;enate is another point, which, being evidently the re&s;ult of compromi&s;e between the oppo&s;ite preten&s;ions of the large and the &s;mall &s;tates, does not call for much di&s;cu&s;&s;ion. If indeed it be right that among a people thoroughly incorporated into one nation, every di&s;trict ought to have a <HI>proportional</HI> &s;hare in the government&punc; and that among independent and &s;overeign &s;tates bound together by a &s;imple league, the parties how|ever unequal in &s;ize, ought to have an <HI>equal</HI> &s;hare in the common councils, it does not appear to be with|out &s;ome rea&s;on, that in a compound republic par|taking both of the national and federal character, the government ought to be founded on a mixture of the principles of proportional and equal repre&s;enta|tion. But it is &s;uperfluous to try by the &s;tandard of theory, a part of the con&s;titution which is allowed on all hands to be the re&s;ult not of theory, but
<Q>of a &s;pirit of amity, and that mutual deference and con|ce&s;&s;ion which the peculiarity of our political &s;itua|tion rendered indi&s;pen&s;able.</Q>
A common govern|ment, with powers equal to its objects, is called for
<PB N="186" REF="021127_0423_0FB24BC79646BA70">
by the voice, and &s;till more loudly by the political &s;ituation of America. A government founded on principles more con&s;onant to the wi&s;hes of the larger &s;tates, is not likely to be obtained from the &s;maller &s;tates. The only option then for the former lies between the propo&s;ed government and a government &s;till more objectionable. Under this alternative the advice of prudence mu&s;t be, to embrace the le&s;&s;er evil; and in&s;tead of indulging a fruitle&s;s anticipation of the po&s;&s;ible mi&s;chiefs which may en&s;ue, to con|template rather the advantageous con&s;equences which may qualify the &s;acrifice.</P>
<P>In this &s;pirit it may be remarked, that the equal vote allowed to each &s;tate, is at once a con&s;titutional recognition of the portion of &s;overeignty remaining in the individual &s;tates, and an in&s;trument for pre|&s;erving that re&s;iduary &s;overeignty. So far the equality ought to be no le&s;s acceptable to the large than to the &s;mall &s;tates; &s;ince they are not le&s;s &s;olici|tous to guard by every po&s;&s;ible expedient again&s;t an improper con&s;olidation of the &s;tates into one &s;imple republic.</P>
<P>Another advantage accruing from this ingredient in the con&s;titution of the &s;enate, is the additional impediment it mu&s;t prove again&s;t improper acts of legi&s;lation. No law or re&s;olution can now be pa&s;&s;ed without the concurrence fir&s;t of a majority of the people, and then of a majority of the &s;tates. It mu&s;t be acknowledged that this complicated check on legi&s;lation may in &s;ome in&s;tances be injurious as well as beneficial; and that the peculiar defence which it involves in favor of the &s;maller &s;tates would be more rational, if any intere&s;ts common to them, and di&s;tinct from tho&s;e of the other &s;tates, would other|wi&s;e be expo&s;ed to peculiar danger. But as the larger &s;tates will always be able by their power over the &s;upplies, to defeat unrea&s;onable exertions of this pre|rogative of the le&s;&s;er &s;tates; and as the facility and exce&s;s of law making &s;eem to be the di&s;ea&s;es to
<PB N="187" REF="021127_0424_0FB24BCE44D79408">
which our governments are mo&s;t liable, it is not impo&s;&s;ible that this part of the con&s;titution may be more convenient in practice than it appears to many in contemplation.</P>
<P N="4">IV. The number of &s;enators and the duration of their appointment come next to be con&s;idered. In order to form an accurate judgment on both the&s;e points, it will be proper to enquire into the purpo&s;es which are to be an&s;wered by a &s;enate; and in order to a&s;certain the&s;e it will be nece&s;&s;ary to review the inconveniencies which a republic mu&s;t &s;uffer from the want of &s;uch an in&s;titution.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t.</HI> It is a misfortune incident to republican government, though in a le&s;s degree than to other governments, that tho&s;e who admini&s;ter it, may forget their obligations to their con&s;tituents, and prove unfaithful to their important tru&s;t. In this point of view, a &s;enate, as a &s;econd branch of the legi&s;lative a&s;&s;embly, di&s;tinct from, and dividing the power with, a fir&s;t, mu&s;t be in all ca&s;es a &s;alutary check on the government. It doubles the &s;ecurity to the people, by requiring the concurrence of two di&s;tinct bodies in &s;chemes of u&s;urpation or perfidy, where the ambition or corruption of one, would otherwi&s;e be &s;ufficient. This is a precaution founded on &s;uch clear principles, and now &s;o well under&s;tood in the United States, that it would be more than &s;uperfluous to enlarge on it. I will barely remark that as the improbability of &s;ini&s;ter combinations will be in proportion to the di&s;&s;imilarity in the genius of the two bodies; it mu&s;t be politic to di&s;tingui&s;h them from each other by every circum|&s;tance which will con&s;i&s;t with a due harmony in all proper mea&s;ures, and with the genuine principles of republican government.</P>
<P><HI>Second.</HI> The nece&s;&s;ity of a &s;enate is not le&s;s indicated by the propen&s;ity of all &s;ingle and nume|rous a&s;&s;emblies, to yield to the impul&s;e of &s;udden and violent pa&s;&s;ions, and to be &s;educed by factious
<PB N="188" REF="021127_0425_0FB24BD5ABEAFB20">
leaders into intemperate and pernicious re&s;olutions. Examples on this &s;ubject might be cited without number; and from proceedings within the United States, as well as from the hi&s;tory of other nations. But a po&s;ition that will not be contradicted need not be proved. All that need be remarked is that a body which is to correct this infirmity ought it&s;elf be free from it, and con&s;equently ought to be le&s;s numerous. It ought moreover to po&s;&s;e&s;s great firm|ne&s;s, and con&s;equently ought to hold its authority by a tenure of con&s;iderable duration.</P>
<P><HI>Third.</HI> Another defect to be &s;upplied by a &s;enate lies in a want of due acquaintance with the objects and principles of legi&s;lation. It is not po&s;&s;ible that an a&s;&s;embly of men called for the mo&s;t part from pur&s;uits of a private nature, continued in appoint|ment for a &s;hort time, and led by no permanent motive to devote the intervals of public occupation to a &s;tudy of the laws, the affairs and the comprehen&s;ive intere&s;ts of their country, &s;hould, if left wholly to them&s;elves, e&s;cape a variety of important errors in the exerci&s;e of their legi&s;lative tru&s;t. It may be affirmed, on the be&s;t grounds, that no &s;mall &s;hare of the pre&s;ent embarra&s;&s;ments of America is to be charged on the blunders of our governments; and that the&s;e have proceeded from the heads rather than the hearts of mo&s;t of the authors of them. What indeed are all the repealing, explaining and amend|ing laws, which fill and di&s;grace our voluminous codes, but &s;o many monuments of deficient wi&s;dom; &s;o many impeachments exhibited by each &s;ucceeding, again&s;t each preceding &s;e&s;&s;ion; &s;o many admonitions to the people of the value of tho&s;e aids which may be expected from a well con&s;tituted &s;enate?</P>
<P>A good government implies two things; fir&s;t, fidelity to the object of government, which is the happine&s;s of the people; &s;econdly, a knowledge of the means by which that object can be be&s;t attained. Some governments are deficient in both the&s;e qua|lities:
<PB N="189" REF="021127_0426_0FB24BD67031EBD0">
Mo&s;t governments are deficient in the fir&s;t. I &s;cruple not to a&s;&s;ert that in the American governments, too little attention has been paid to the la&s;t. The federal con&s;titution avoids this error; and what merits particular notice, it provides for the la&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> mode which increa&s;es the &s;ecurity for the fir&s;t.</P>
<P><HI>Fourth.</HI> The mutability in the public councils, ari&s;ing from a rapid &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of new members, how|ever qualified they may be, points out in the &s;tronge&s;t manner, the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;ome &s;table in&s;titution in the government. Every new election in the &s;tates, is found to change one half of the repre&s;entatives. From this change of men mu&s;t proceed a change of opinions; and from a change of opinions, a change of mea&s;ures. But a continual change even of good mea&s;ures is incon&s;i&s;tent with every rule of prudence, and every pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s. The remark is veri|fied in private life, and becomes more ju&s;t as well as more important, in national tran&s;actions.</P>
<P>To trace the mi&s;chievous effects of a mutable government would fill a volume. I will hint a few only, each of which will be perceived to be a &s;ource of innumerable others.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place it forfeits the re&s;pect and confi|dence of other nations, and all the advantages con|nected with national character. An individual who is ob&s;erved to be incon&s;tant to his plans, or perhaps to carry on his affairs without any plan at all, is marked at once by all prudent people, as a &s;peedy victim to his own un&s;teadine&s;s and folly. His more friendly neighbours may pity him; but all will decline to connect their fortunes with his; and not a few will &s;eize the opportunity of making their for|tunes out of his. One nation is to another what one individual is to another; with this melancholy di&s;tinction perhaps, that the former with fewer of the benevolent emotions than the latter, are under fewer re&s;traints al&s;o from taking undue advantage of
<PB N="190" REF="021127_0427_0FB24BDD62994108">
the indi&s;cretions of each other. Every nation con|&s;equently, who&s;e affairs betray a want of wi&s;dom and &s;tability, may calculate on every lo&s;s which can be &s;u&s;tained from the more &s;y&s;tematic policy of its wi&s;er neighbours. But the be&s;t in&s;truction on this &s;ubject is unhappily conveyed to America by the example of her own &s;ituation. She finds that &s;he is held in no re&s;pect by her friends; that &s;he is the deri&s;ion of her enemies; and that &s;he is a prey to every nation which has an intere&s;t in &s;peculating on her fluctuating councils and embarra&s;&s;ed affairs.</P>
<P>The internal effects of a mutable policy are &s;till more calamitous. It poi&s;ons the ble&s;&s;ings of liberty it&s;elf. It will be of little avail to the people that the laws are made by men of their own choice, if the laws be &s;o voluminous that they cannot be read, or &s;o incoherent that they cannot be under&s;tood; if they be repealed or revi&s;ed before they are promulged, or undergo &s;uch ince&s;&s;ant changes that no man who knows what the law is to day can gue&s;s what it will be to morrow. Law is defined to be a rule of action; but how can that be a rule, which is little known and le&s;s fixed?</P>
<P>Another effect of public in&s;tability is the unrea|&s;onable advantage it gives to the &s;agacious, the enter|pri&s;ing and the moneyed few, over the indu&s;trious and uninformed ma&s;s of the people. Every new regu|lation concerning commerce or revenue; or in any manner affecting the value of the different &s;pecies of property, pre&s;ents a new harve&s;t to tho&s;e who watch the change and can trace its con&s;equences; a harve&s;t reared not by them&s;elves but by the toils and cares of the great body of their fellow citizens. This is a &s;tate of things in which it may be &s;aid with &s;ome truth that laws are made for the <HI>few</HI> not for the <HI>many.</HI></P>
<P>In another point of view great injury re&s;ults from an un&s;table government. The want of confidence in the public councils damps every u&s;eful undertaking;
<PB N="191" REF="021127_0428_0FB24BDEB3FF6E90">
the &s;ucce&s;s and profit of which may depend on a con|tinuance of exi&s;ting arrangements. What prudent merchant will hazard his fortunes in any new branch of commerce, when he knows not but that his plans may be rendered unlawful before they can be execu|ted? What farmer or manufacturer will lay him&s;elf out for the encouragement given to any particular cultivation or e&s;tabli&s;hment, when he can have no a&s;&s;urance that his preparatory labours and advances will not render him a victim to an incon&s;tant govern|ment?

<HEAD>NUMBER LXIII. A further View of the Con&s;titution of the Senate, in regard to the Duration of the Appointment of its Members.</HEAD>
<P>A FIFTH de&s;ideratum illu&s;trating the utility of a &s;enate, is the want of a due &s;en&s;e of national character. Without a &s;elect and &s;table member of the government, the e&s;teem of &s;o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eign powers will not only by forfeited by an unenlightened and variable policy, proceeding from the cau&s;es already mentioned;
<PB N="192" REF="021127_0429_0FB24BE19A5CB3F8">
but the national councils will not po&s;&s;e&s;s that &s;en&s;i|bility to the opinion of the world, which is perhaps not le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary in order to merit, than it is to obtain, its re&s;pect and confidence.</P>
<P>An attention to the judgment of other nations is important to every government for two rea&s;ons: The one is, that independently of the merits of any parti|cular plan or mea&s;ure, it is de&s;irable on various accounts, that it &s;hould appear to other nations as the offspring of a wi&s;e and honorable policy: The &s;econd is, that in doubtful ca&s;es, particularly where the national councils may be warped by &s;ome &s;trong pa&s;&s;ion, or momentary intere&s;t, the pre&s;umed or known opinion of the impartial world, may be the be&s;t guide that can be followed. What has not America lo&s;t by her want of character with foreign nations? And how many errors and follies would &s;he not have avoided, if the ju&s;tice and propriety of her mea&s;ures had in every in&s;tance been previou&s;ly tried by the light in which they would probably appear to the unbia&s;&s;ed part of mankind.</P>
<P>Yet however requi&s;ite a &s;en&s;e of national character may be, it is evident that it can never b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;ufficiently po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by a numerous and changeable body. It can only be found in a number &s;o &s;mall, that a &s;en|&s;ible degree of the prai&s;e and blame of public mea|&s;ures may be the portion of each individual; or in an a&s;&s;embly &s;o durably inve&s;ted with public tru&s;t, that the pride and con&s;equence of its members may be &s;en&s;ibly incorporated with the reputation and pro&s;perity of the community. The half-yearly repre|&s;entatives of Rhode-I&s;land, would probably have been little affected in their deliberations on the iniquitous mea&s;ures of that &s;tate, by arguments drawn from the light in which &s;uch mea&s;ures would be viewed by foreign nations, or even by the &s;i&s;ter &s;tates; whil&s;t it can &s;carcely be doubted, that if the concurrence of a &s;elect and &s;table body had been nece&s;&s;ary, a regard to national character alone,
<PB N="193" REF="021127_0430_0FB24BE7534B9340">
would have prevented the calamities under which that mi&s;guided people is now labouring.</P>
<P>I add as a <HI>&s;ixth</HI> defect, the want in &s;ome impor|tant ca&s;es of a due re&s;pon&s;ibility in the government to the people, ari&s;ing from that frequency of elec|tions, which in other ca&s;es produces this re&s;pon&s;ibi|lity. The remark will perhaps appear not only new but paradoxical. It mu&s;t neverthele<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s be acknow|ledged, when explained, to be as undeniable as it is important.</P>
<P>Re&s;pon&s;ibility in order to be rea&s;onable mu&s;t be limited to objects within the power of the re&s;pon&s;ible party; and in order to be effectual, mo&s;t relate to operations of that power, of which a ready and proper judgement can be formed by the con&s;ti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">uents. The objects of government may be divided into two gene|ral cla&s;&s;es; the one depending on mea&s;ures which have &s;ingly an immediate and &s;en&s;ible operation; the other depending on a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of well cho&s;en and well connected mea&s;ures, which have a gradual and perhaps unob&s;erved operation. The importance of the latter de&s;cription to the collective and permanent welfare of every country needs no explanation. And yet it is evident, that an a&s;&s;embly elected for &s;o &s;hort a term as to be unable to provide more than one or two links in a chain of mea&s;ures, on which the general welfare may e&s;&s;entially depend, ought not to be an&s;werable for the final re&s;ult, any more than a &s;teward or tenant, engaged for one year, could be ju&s;tly made to an&s;wer for places or improvements, which could not be accompli&s;hed in le&s;s than half a dozen years. Nor is it po&s;&s;ible for the people to e&s;ti|mate the <HI>&s;hare</HI> of influence which their annual a&s;&s;em|blies may re&s;pectively have on events re&s;ulting from the mixed tran&s;actions of &s;everal years. It is &s;uffi|ciently difficult, at any rate, to pre&s;erve a per&s;onal re&s;pon&s;ibility in the members of a <HI>numerous</HI> body, for &s;uch acts of the body as have an immediate, detached and palpable operation on its con&s;tituents.</P>
<P><PB N="194" REF="021127_0431_0FB24BEA0E86A4A8">The proper remedy for this defect mu&s;t be an addi|tional body in the legi&s;lative department, which hav|ing &s;ufficient permanency to provide for &s;uch objects as require a continued attention, and a train of mea|&s;ures, may be ju&s;tly and effectually an&s;werable for the attainment of tho&s;e objects.</P>
<P>Thus far I have con&s;idered the circum&s;tances which point out the nece&s;&s;ity of a well con&s;tructed &s;enate, only as they relate to the repre&s;entatives of the people. To a people as little blinded by prejudice, or cor|rupted by flattery, as tho&s;e whom I addre&s;s, I &s;hall not &s;cruple to add, that &s;uch an in&s;titution may be &s;ometimes nece&s;&s;ary, as a defence to the people again&s;t their own temporary errors and delu&s;ions. As the cool and deliberate &s;en&s;e of the community ought in all governments, and actually will in all free govern|ments ultimately prevail over the views of its rulers; &s;o there are particular moments in public affairs, when the people &s;timulated by &s;ome irregular pa&s;&s;ion, or &s;ome illicit advantage, or mi&s;led by the artful mi&s;re|pre&s;entations of intere&s;ted men, may call for mea&s;ures which they them&s;elves will afterwards be the mo&s;t ready to lament and condemn. In the&s;e critical mo|ments, how &s;alutary will be the interference of &s;ome temperate and re&s;pectable body of citizens, in order to check the mi&s;guided career, and to &s;u&s;pend the blow meditated by the people again&s;t them&s;elves, until rea|&s;on, ju&s;tice and truth, can regain their authority over the public mind? What bitter angui&s;h would not the people of Athens have often e&s;caped, if their govern|ment had contained &s;o provident a &s;afeguard again&s;t the tyranny of their own pa&s;&s;ions? Popular liberty might then have e&s;caped the indelible reproach of decreeing to the &s;ame citizens, the hemlock on one day, and &s;tatues on the next.</P>
<P>It may be &s;ugge&s;ted that a people &s;pread over an exten&s;ive region, cannot like the crouded inhabitants of a &s;mall di&s;trict, be &s;ubject to the infection of vio|lent pa&s;&s;ions; or to the danger of combining in the
<PB N="195" REF="021127_0432_0FB24BECA516D3C8">
pur&s;uit of unju&s;t mea&s;ures. I am far from denying that this is a di&s;tinction of peculiar importance. I have on the contrary endeavoured in a former paper to &s;hew that it is one of the principle recomendations of a confederated republic. At the &s;ame time this advantage ought not to be con&s;idered as &s;uper&s;eding the u&s;e of auxiliary precautions. It may even be remarked that the &s;ame extended &s;ituation which will exempt the people of America from &s;ome of the dan|gers incident to le&s;&s;er republics, will expo&s;e them to the inconveniency of remaining for a longer time, under the influence of tho&s;e mi&s;repre&s;entations which the combined indu&s;try of intere&s;ted men may &s;ucceed in d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;tributing among them.</P>
<P>It adds no &s;mall weight to all the&s;e con&s;iderations, to recollect, that hi&s;tory informs us of no long lived republic which had not a &s;enate. Sparta, Rome and Carthage are in fact the only &s;tates to whom that character can be applied. In each of the two fir&s;t there was a &s;enate for life. The con&s;titution of the &s;enate in the la&s;t, is le&s;s known. Circum&s;tantial evi|dence makes it probable that it was not different in this particular from the two others. It is at lea&s;t cer|tain that it had &s;ome quality or o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">her which rendered it an anchor again&s;t popular fluctuations; and that a &s;maller council drawn out of the &s;enate was appointed not only for life, but filled up vacancies it&s;elf. The&s;e examples, though as unfit for the imitation as they are repugnant to the genius of America, are notwith|&s;tanding, when compared with the fugitive and tur|bulent exi&s;tence of other antient republics, very in|&s;tructive proofs of the nece&s;&s;i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y of &s;ome in&s;titution that will blend &s;tability with liberty. I am not un|aware of the circum&s;tances which di&s;tingui&s;h the American from other popular governments, as well an|tient as modern; and which render extreme circum|&s;pection nece&s;&s;ary in rea&s;oning from the one ca&s;e to the other. But after allowing due weight to this con|&s;ideration, it may &s;till be maintained that there are
<PB N="196" REF="021127_0433_0FB24BF4A0C01FF0">
many points of &s;imilitude which render the&s;e exam|ples not unworthy of our attention. Many of the defects as we have &s;een, which can only be &s;upplied by a &s;enatorial in&s;titution, are common to a numerous a&s;&s;embly frequently elected by the people, and to the people them&s;elves. There are others peculiar to the former, which require the controul of &s;uch an in&s;ti|tution. The people can never wilfully betray their own intere&s;ts: but they may po&s;&s;ibly be betrayed by the repre&s;entatives of the people; and the danger will be evidently greater where the whole legi&s;lative tru&s;t is lodged in the hands of one body of men, than where the concurrence of &s;eparate and di&s;&s;imilar bodies is required in every public act.</P>
<P>The difference mo&s;t relied on between the Ameri|can and other republics, con&s;i&s;ts in the principle of repre&s;entation, which is the pivot on which the for|mer move, and which is &s;uppo&s;ed to have been un|known to the latter, or at lea&s;t to the antient part of them. The u&s;e which has been made of this differ|ence, in rea&s;onings contained in former papers, will have &s;hewn that I am di&s;po&s;ed neither to deny its ex|i&s;tance nor to undervalue its importance. I feel the le&s;s re&s;traint therefore in ob&s;erving that the po&s;ition concerning the ignorance of the antient governments on the &s;ubject of repre&s;entation is by no means pre|ci&s;ely true in the latitude commonly given to it. Without entering into a di&s;qui&s;ition which here would be mi&s;placed, I will refer to a few known facts in &s;upport of what I advance.</P>
<P>In the mo&s;t pure democracies of Greece, many of the executive functions were performed not by the people them&s;elves, but by officers elected by the people, and <HI>repre&s;enting</HI> the people in their <HI>executive</HI> capacity.</P>
<P>Prior to the reform of Solon, Athens was governed by nine archons, annually <HI>elected by the people at large.</HI> The degree of power delegated to them &s;eems to be left in great ob&s;curity. Sub&s;equent to that period,
<PB N="197" REF="021127_0434_0FB24BF6AACD7948">
we find an a&s;&s;embly fir&s;t of four and afterwards of &s;ix hundred members, annually <HI>elected by the people</HI>; and <HI>partially</HI> repre&s;enting them in their <HI>legi&s;lative</HI> capacity, &s;ince they were not only a&s;&s;ociated with the people in the function of making laws; but had the exclu&s;ive right o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> originating legi&s;lative propo&s;itions to the people. The &s;enate of Carthage al&s;o, whatever might be its power or the duration of its appoint|ment, appears to have been elective by the &s;uffrages of the people. Similar in&s;tances might be traced in mo&s;t if not all the popular governments of antiquity.</P>
<P>La&s;tly in Sparta, we meet wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h the ephori, and in Rome with the tribunes; two bodies, &s;mall indeed in number, but annually <HI>elected by the who<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e body of the people,</HI> and con&s;idered as the <HI>repre&s;entatives</HI> of the people, almo&s;t in their <HI>plenipotentiary</HI> capacity.

<P>From the&s;e facts, to which many others might be added, it is clear that the principle of repre&s;entation was neither unknown to the ancients, nor wholly over|looked in their political con&s;titutions. The true di&s;tinction between the&s;e and the American govern|ments lies <HI>in the total exclu&s;ion of the people in their collective capacity</HI> from any &s;hare in the <HI>latter,</HI> and not in the <HI>total exclu&s;ion of the repre&s;entatives of the people,</HI> from the admini&s;tration of the <HI>former.</HI> The d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;tinction however thus qualified mu&s;t be admitted to leave a mo&s;t advantageous &s;uperiority in favour of the United States. But to en&s;ure to this advantage its full effect, we mu&s;t be careful not to &s;eparate it from the other advantage, of an exten&s;ive territory. For it cannot be believed that any form of repre|&s;entative government, could have &s;ucceeded within
<PB N="198" REF="021127_0435_0FB24BF9B0F5E7B0">
the narrow limits occupied by the democracies of Greece.</P>
<P>In an&s;wer to all the&s;e arguments, &s;ugge&s;ted by rea|&s;on, illu&s;trated by examples, and enforced by our our own experience, the jealous adver&s;ary of the con&s;titution will probably content him&s;elf with repeat|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">g, that a &s;enate appointed not immediately by the p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rple, and for the term of &s;ix years, mu&s;t gradually i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">quire a dangerous pre-eminence in the government, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> finally transform it into a tyrannical ari&s;tocracy.</P>
<P>To this general an&s;wer the general reply ought to b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;ufficient; that liberty may be endangered by the abu&s;es of liberty, as well as by the abu&s;es of power; tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> there are numerous in&s;tances of the former as well as of the latter; and that the former rather than the latter is apparently mo&s;t to be apprehended by the United States. But a more particular reply may be given.</P>
<P>Before &s;uch a revolution can be effected, the &s;enate, it is to be ob&s;erved, mu&s;t in the fir&s;t place corrupt it&s;elf; mu&s;t next corrupt the &s;tate legi&s;latures, mu&s;t then corrupt the hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives, and mu&s;t finally corrupt the people at large. It is evi|dent that the &s;enate mu&s;t be fir&s;t corrupted, before it can attempt an e&s;tabli&s;hment of tyranny. Without corrupting the legi&s;latures, it cannot pro&s;ecute the attempt, becau&s;e the periodical change of mem|bers would otherwi&s;e regenerate the whole body. Without exerting the means of corruption with equal &s;ucce&s;s on the hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives, the oppo&s;ition of that co-equal branch of the government would inevitably defeat the attempt; and without corrupting the people them&s;elves, a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of new repre&s;entatives would &s;peedily re&s;tore all things to their pri&s;tine order. Is there any man who can &s;eriou&s;ly per&s;uade him&s;elf that the propo&s;ed &s;enate can, by any po&s;&s;ible means within the compa&s;s of human addre&s;s, arrive at the object of a lawle&s;s am|bition, through all the&s;e ob&s;tructions?</P>
<P><PB N="199" REF="021127_0436_0FB24BFD659648B0">If rea&s;on condemns the &s;u&s;picion, the &s;ame &s;en|tence is pronounced by experience. The con&s;titu|tion of Maryland furni&s;hes the mo&s;t appo&s;ite ex|ample. The &s;enate of that &s;tate is elected, as the federal &s;enate will be, indirectly by the people; and for a term le&s;s by one year only, than the federal &s;e|nate. It is di&s;tingui&s;hed al&s;o by the remarkable pre|rogative of filling up its own vacancies within the term of its appointment; and at the &s;ame time, is not under the control of any &s;uch rotation, as is provided for the federal &s;enate. There are &s;ome other le&s;&s;er di&s;tinctions, which would expo&s;e the for|mer to colorable &s;ubjections that do not lie again&s;t the latter. If the federal &s;enate therefore really contained the danger which has been &s;o loudly pro|claimed, &s;ome &s;ymptoms at lea&s;t of a like danger ought by this time to have been betrayed by the &s;e|nate of Maryland; but no &s;uch &s;ymptoms have ap|peared. On the contrary the jealou&s;ies at fir&s;t en|tertained by men of the &s;ame de&s;cription with tho&s;e who view with terror the corre&s;pondent part of the federal con&s;titution, have been gradually extingui&s;hed by the progre&s;s of the experiment; and the Maryland con&s;titution is daily deriving from the &s;alutary oper|ation of this part of it, a reputation in which it will probably not be rivalled by that of any &s;tate in the union.</P>
<P>But if any thing could &s;ilence the jealou&s;ies on this &s;ubject, it ought to be the Briti&s;h example. The &s;enate there, in&s;tead of being elected for a term of &s;ix years, and of being unconfined to particular families or fortunes, is an hereditary a&s;&s;embly of opulent nobles. The hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives, in&s;tead of being elected for two years, and by the whole body of the people, is elected for &s;even years; and in very great proportion, by a very &s;mall proportion of the people. Here unque&s;tionably ought to be &s;een in full di&s;play, the ari&s;tocratic u&s;urpations and tyranny, which are at &s;ome future period to be exemplified in
<PB N="200" REF="021127_0437_0FB24BFEEA8F0118">
the United States. Unfortunately however for the antifederal argument, the Briti&s;h hi&s;tory informs us, that this hereditary a&s;&s;embly has not even been able to defend it&s;elf again&s;t the continual encroachments of the hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives; and that it no &s;ooner lo&s;t the &s;upport of the monarch, than it was actually cru&s;hed by the weight of the popular branch.</P>
<P>As far as antiquity can in&s;truct us on this &s;ubject, its examples &s;upport the rea&s;oning which we have employed. In Sparta the ephori, the annual repre|&s;entatives of the people, were found an overmatch for the &s;enate for life, continually gained on its au|thority, and finally drew all power into their own hands. The tribunes of Rome, who were the repre|&s;entatives of the people, prevailed, it is well known, in almo&s;t every conte&s;t with the &s;enate for life, and in the end gained the mo&s;t complete triumph over it. This fact is the more remarkab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e, as unanimity was required in every act of the tribunes, even after their number was augmented to ten. It proves the irre|&s;i&s;table force po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by that branch of a free govern|ment, which has the people on its &s;ide. To the&s;e examples might be added that of Carthage, who&s;e &s;enate, according to the te&s;timony of Polybius, in&s;tead of drawing all power into its vortex, had at the com|mencement of the &s;econd punic war, lo&s;t almo&s;t the whole of its original portion.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the conclu&s;ive evidence re&s;ulting from this a&s;&s;emblage of facts, that the federal &s;enate will never be able to transform it&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lf, by gradual u&s;urpations, into an independent and ari&s;tocratic body; we are warranted in believing that if &s;uch a revolution &s;hould ever happen from cau&s;es which the fore&s;ight of man cannot guard again&s;t, the hou&s;e of repre&s;enta|tives with the people on their &s;ide will at all times be able to bring back the con&s;titution to its primi|tive form and principles.

<P>As the &s;elect a&s;&s;emblies for choo&s;ing the pre&s;ident, as well as the &s;tate legi&s;latures who appoint the &s;ena|tors will in general be compo&s;ed of the mo&s;t enlight|ned and re&s;pectable citizens, there is rea&s;on to pre|&s;ume that their attention and their votes will be di|rected to tho&s;e men only who have become the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed by their abilities and virtue, and in whom the people perceive ju&s;t grounds for confidence.

By excluding men under thirty five from the fir&s;t office, and tho&s;e under thirty from the &s;econd, it confines the elections to men of whom the people have had time to form a judgment, and with re&s;pect to w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">om they will not be liable to be deceived by tho&s;e brilliant appearances of genius and patri|oti&s;m, which like tran&s;ient meteors &s;ometimes mi&s;|lead as well as dazzle. If the ob&s;ervation be well founded, that wi&s;e kings will always be &s;erved by able mini&s;ters, it is fair to argue that as an a&s;&s;embly of &s;elect electors po&s;&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;s in a greater degree than kings, the means of exten&s;ive and accurate in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">or|mation relative to men and characters, &s;o will their appointments bear at lea&s;t equal marks of di&s;cretion and di&s;cernment. The inference which naturally re&s;ults from the&s;e con&s;iderations is this, that the pre|&s;ident and &s;enators &s;o cho&s;en will always be of the number of tho&s;e who be&s;t under&s;tand our national in|tere&s;ts, whether con&s;idered in relation to the &s;everal &s;tates or to foreign nations, who are be&s;t able to pro|mote tho&s;e intere&s;ts, and who&s;e reputation for inte|grity in&s;pires and merits confidence. With &s;uch men the power of making treaties may be &s;afely lodged.</P>

<P>It &s;eldom happens in the negotiation of treaties of whatever nature, but that perfect <HI>&s;ecrecy</HI> and imme|diate <HI>di&s;patch</HI> are &s;ometimes requi&s;ite. There are ca&s;es where the mo&s;t u&s;eful intelligence may be ob|tained, if the per&s;ons po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing it can be relieved from apprehen&s;ions of di&s;covery.

<P>They who have turned their attention to the affairs of men, mu&s;t have perceived that there are tides in them. Tides, very irregular in their duration, &s;trength and direction, and &s;eldom found to run twice exactly in the &s;ame manner or mea&s;ure. To di&s;cern and to profit by the&s;e tides in national affairs, is the bu&s;ine&s;s of tho&s;e who pre&s;ide over them; and they who have had much experience on this head inform us, that there frequently are occa&s;ions when days, nay even when hours are precious. The lo&s;s of a battle, the death of a prince, the removal of a mini&s;ter, or other circum&s;tances intervening to change the pre&s;ent po&s;ture and a&s;pect of affairs, may turn the mo&s;t favo|rable tide into a cour&s;e oppo&s;ite to our wi&s;hes. As in the field, &s;o in the cabinet, there are moments to be &s;eized as they pa&s;s, and they who pre&s;ide in either, &s;hould be left in capacity to improve them. So often and &s;o e&s;&s;entially have we heretofore &s;uffered, from the want of &s;ecrecy and di&s;patch, that the con&s;titution
<PB N="205" REF="021127_0442_0FB24C1C246BE9E0">
would have been inexcu&s;ibly defective if no attention had been paid to tho&s;e objects. Tho&s;e matters which in negotiations u&s;ually require the mo&s;t &s;ecrecy and the mo&s;t di&s;patch, are tho&s;e preparatory and auxiliary mea&s;urer which are no otherways important in a na|tional view, then as they tend to facilitate the attain|ment of the objects of the negotiation. For the&s;e the pre&s;ident will find no deficulty to provide, and &s;hould any circum&s;tance occur which requires the advice and con&s;ent of the &s;enate, he may at any time convene them. Thus we &s;ee that the con&s;titution provides that our negotiations for treaties &s;hall have every advantage which can be derived from talents, information, inte|grity and deliberate inve&s;tigations on the one hand, and from &s;ecrecy and di&s;patch on the other.</P>
<P>But to this plan as to mo&s;t others that have ever appeared, objections are contrived and urged.</P>
<P>Some are di&s;plea&s;ed with it, not on account of any errors or defects in it, but becau&s;e as the treaties when made are to have the force of laws, they &s;hould be made only by men inve&s;ted with legi&s;lative authority. The&s;e gentlemen &s;eem not to con&s;ider that the judg|ments of our courts, and the commi&s;&s;ions con&s;titu|tionally given by our governor, are as valid and as binding on all per&s;ons whom they concern, as the laws pa&s;&s;ed by our legi&s;lature are. All con&s;titutional acts of power, whether in the executive or in the judicial department, have as much legal validity and obliga|tion as if they proceeded from the legi&s;lature, and therefore whatever name be given to the power of making treaties, or however obligatory they may be when made, certain it is that the people may with much propriety commit the power to a di&s;tinct body from the legi&s;lature, the executive or the judicial. It &s;urely does not follow that becau&s;e they have given the power of making laws to the legi&s;lature, that therefore they &s;hould likewi&s;e give them power to do every other act of &s;overeignty by which the citizens are to be bound and affected.</P>
<P><PB N="206" REF="021127_0443_0FB24C1F317C9C10">Others, though content that treaties &s;hould be made in the mode propo&s;ed, are aver&s;e to their being the <HI>&s;upreme</HI> laws of the land. They in&s;i&s;t and profe&s;s to believe, that treaties, like acts of a&s;&s;embly, &s;hould be repealable at plea&s;ure. This idea &s;eems to be new and peculiar to this country, but new errors as well as new truths often appear. The&s;e gentlemen would do well to reflect that a treaty is only another name for a bargain; and that it would be impo&s;&s;ible to find a nation who would make any bargain with us, which &s;hould be binding on them <HI>ab&s;olutely,</HI> but on us only &s;o long and &s;o far as we may think proper to be bound by it. They who make laws may with|out doubt amend or repeal them, and it will not be di&s;puted that they who make treaties may alter or cancel them; but &s;till let us not forget that treaties are made not by only one of the contracting parties but by both, and con&s;equently that as the con&s;ent of both was e&s;&s;ential to their formation at fir&s;t, &s;o mu&s;t it ever afterwards be to alter or cancel them. The propo&s;ed con&s;titution therefore has not in the lea&s;t extended the obligation of treaties. They are ju&s;t as binding, and ju&s;t as far beyond the lawful reach of legi&s;lative acts now, as they will be at any future period, or under any form of government.</P>
<P>However u&s;eful jealou&s;y may be in republics, yet when, like bile in the natural, it abounds too much in the body politic; the eyes of both become very liable to be deceived by the delu&s;ive appearances which that malady ca&s;ts on &s;urrounding objects. From this cau&s;e probably proceed the fears and apprehen&s;ions of &s;ome, that the pre&s;ident and &s;enate may make treaties without an equal eye to the intere&s;ts of all the &s;tates. Others &s;u&s;pect that the two-thirds will oppre&s;s the remaining third, and a&s;k whether tho&s;e gentlemen are made &s;ufficiently re&s;pon&s;ible for their conduct&mdash; whether if they act corruptly they can be puni&s;hed; and if they make di&s;advantageous treaties, how are we to get rid of tho&s;e treaties?</P>

In proportion as the United States a&s;&s;ume a national form, and a national character, &s;o will the good of the whole be more and more an object of attention; and the government mu&s;t be a weak one indeed, if it &s;hould forget that the good of the whole can only be promoted by advancing the good of each of the parts or members which compo&s;e the whole.

<P>As to corruption, the ca&s;e is not &s;uppo&s;eable, he mu&s;t either have been very unfortunate in his inter|cour&s;e with the world, or po&s;&s;e&s;s a heart very &s;u&s;cep|tible of &s;uch impre&s;&s;ions, who can think it probable that the pre&s;ident and two-thirds of the &s;enate will ever be capable of &s;uch unworthy conduct.

<HEAD>NUMBER LXV. A further View of the Con&s;titution of the Senate, in Relation to its Capacity as a Court for the Trial of Impeachments.</HEAD>
<P>THE remaining powers which the plan of the convention allots to the &s;enate, in a di&s;tinct capacity, are compri&s;ed in their participation with the executive in the appointment to offices, and in their judicial character as a court for the trial of impeachments. As in the bu&s;ine&s;s of appointments the executive will be the principal agent, the provi|&s;ions relating to it will mo&s;t properly be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed in the examination of that department. We will there|fore conclude this head with a view of the judicial character of the &s;enate.</P>
<P>A well con&s;tituted court for the trial of impeach|ments, is an object not more to be de&s;ired than dif|ficult to be obtained in a government wholly elective. The &s;ubjects of its juri&s;diction are tho&s;e offences which proceed from the mi&s;conduct of public men, or in other words from the abu&s;e or violation of &s;ome public tru&s;t. They are of a nature which may with peculiar propriety be denominated POLITICAL, as they relate chiefly to injuries done immediately to the &s;ociety it&s;elf. The pro&s;ecution of them, for this rea&s;on, will &s;eldom fail to agitate the pa&s;&s;ions of the whole community, and to divide it into parties, more
<PB N="209" REF="021127_0446_0FB24C2BD78604B8">
or le&s;s friendly, or inimical, to the accu&s;ed. In many ca&s;es, it will connect it&s;elf with the pre-exi&s;ting fac|tions, and will inli&s;t all their animo&s;ities, partialities, influence and intere&s;t on one &s;ide, or on the other; and in &s;uch ca&s;es there will always be the greate&s;t danger, that the deci&s;ion will be regulated more by the comparative &s;trength of parties than by the real demon&s;trations of innocence or guilt.</P>
<P>The delicacy and magnitude of a tru&s;t, which &s;o deeply concerns the political reputation and exi&s;tence of every man engaged in the admini&s;tration of public affairs, &s;peak for them&s;elves. The difficulty of placing it rightly in a government re&s;ting entirely on the ba&s;is of periodical electons will as readily be perceived, when it is con&s;idered that the mo&s;t con|&s;picuous characters in it will, from that circum&s;tance, be too often the leaders, or the tools of the mo&s;t cun|ning or the mo&s;t numerous faction; and on this account can hardly be expected to po&s;&s;e&s;s the requi|&s;ite neutrality towards tho&s;e who&s;e conduct may be the &s;ubject of &s;crutiny.</P>
<P>The convention, it appears, thought the &s;enate the mo&s;t fit depo&s;itary of this important tru&s;t. Tho&s;e who can be&s;t di&s;cern the intrin&s;ic difficulty of the thing, will be lea&s;t ha&s;ty in condemning that opinion; and will be mo&s;t inclined to allow due weight to the arguments which may be &s;uppo&s;ed to have produced it.</P>
<P>What it may be a&s;ked, is the true &s;pirit of the in&s;titution it&s;elf? Is it not de&s;igned as a method of NATIONAL INQUEST into the conduct of public men? If this be the de&s;ign of it, who can &s;o pro|perly be the inqui&s;itors for the nation as the repre|&s;entatives of the nation them&s;elves? It is not di&s;pu|ted that the power of originating the inquiry, or in other words, of preferring the impeachment ought to be lodged in the hands of one branch of the legi&s;la|tive body; will not the rea&s;ons which indicate the propriety of this arrangement, &s;trongly plead for an
<PB N="210" REF="021127_0447_0FB24C3E878CFFA8">
admi&s;&s;ion of the other branch of that body to a &s;hare of the inquiry? The model, from which the idea of this in&s;titution has been borrowed, pointed out that cour&s;e to the convention. In Great-Britain, it is the province of the hou&s;e of commons to prefer the impeachment; and of the hou&s;e of lords to decide upon it. Several of the &s;tate con&s;titutions have followed the example. As well the latter as the former &s;eem to have regarded the practice of im|peachments, as a bridle in the hands of the legi&s;la|tive body upon the executive &s;ervants of the govern|ment. Is not this the true light in which it ought to be regarded?</P>
<P>Where el&s;e, than in the &s;enate, could have been found a tribunal &s;ufficiently dignified, or &s;ufficiently independent? What other body would be likely to feel <HI>confidence enough in its own &s;ituation,</HI> to pre&s;erve unawed and uninfluenced the nece&s;&s;ary impartiality between an <HI>individual</HI> accu&s;ed, and the <HI>repre&s;enta|tives of the people, his accu&s;ers?</HI></P>
<P>Could the &s;upreme court have been relied upon as an&s;wering this de&s;cription? It is much to be doubted whether the members of that tribunal would, at all times, be endowed, with &s;o eminent a portion of for|titude, as would be called for in the execution of &s;o difficult a ta&s;k, and it is &s;till more to be doubted, whether they would po&s;&s;e&s;s the degree of credit and authority, which might, on certain occa&s;ions be indi&s;|pen&s;able, towards reconciling the people to a deci&s;ion that &s;hould happen to cla&s;h with an accu&s;ation brought by their immediate repre&s;entatives. A deficiency in the fir&s;t would be fatal to the accu&s;ed, in the la&s;t, dangerous to the public tranquility. The hazard in both the&s;e re&s;pects could only be avoided, if at all, by rendering that tribunal more numerous than would con&s;i&s;t with a rea&s;onable attention to economy. The nece&s;&s;ity of a numerous court for the trial of impeach|ments is equally dictated by the nature of the pro|ceeding. This can never be tied down by &s;uch &s;trict
<PB N="211" REF="021127_0448_0FB24C3F687DD840">
rules, either in the delineation of the offence by the pro&s;ecutors, or in the con&s;truction of it by the judges as in common ca&s;es &s;erve to limit the di&s;cretion of courts in favour of per&s;onal &s;ecurity. There will be no jury to &s;tand between the judges, who are to pro|nounce the &s;entence of the law and the party who is to receive or &s;uffer it. The awful di&s;cretion, which a court of impeachments mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have, to doom to honour or to infamy the mo&s;t confidential and the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed characters of the commu|nity, forbids the commitment of the tru&s;t to a &s;mall number of per&s;ons.</P>
<P>The&s;e con&s;iderations &s;eem alone &s;ufficient to autho|ri&s;e a conclu&s;ion that the &s;upreme court would have been an improper &s;ub&s;titute for the &s;enate, as a court of impeachments. There remains a further con&s;ide|ration which will not a little &s;trengthen this con|clu&s;ion. It is this&mdash;The puni&s;hment, which may be the con&s;equence of conviction upon impeachment, is not to terminate the cha&s;ti&s;ement of the offender. After having been &s;entenced to a perpetual o&s;traci&s;m from the e&s;teem and confidence, and honors and emo|luments of his country, he will &s;till be liable to pro|&s;ecution and puni&s;hment in the ordinary cour&s;e of law. Would it be proper that the per&s;ons, who had di&s;po&s;ed of his fame and his mo&s;t valuable rights as a citizen in one trial, &s;hould in another trial, for the fame offence, be al&s;o the di&s;po&s;ers of his life and his fortune? Would there not be the greate&s;t rea&s;on to apprehend, that error in the fir&s;t &s;entence would be the parent of error in the &s;econd &s;entence? That the &s;trong bias of one deci&s;ion would be apt to overrule the influence of any new lights, which might be brought to vary the complexion of another deci&s;ion? Tho&s;e, who know any thing of human nature, will not he&s;itate to an&s;wer the&s;e que&s;tions in the affir|mative; and will be at no lo&s;s to perceive, that by making the &s;ame per&s;ons judges in both ca&s;es, tho&s;e who might happen to be the objects of pro&s;ecution
<PB N="212" REF="021127_0449_0FB24C40E86A8EC0">
would in a great mea&s;ure be deprived of the double &s;ecurity intended them by a double trial. The lo&s;s of life and e&s;tate would often be virtually included in a &s;entence, which, in its terms, imported nothing more than di&s;mi&s;&s;ion from a pre&s;ent, and di&s;qualification for a future office. It may be &s;aid, that the inter|vention of a jury, in the &s;econd in&s;tance, would obviate the danger. But juries are frequently influenced by the opinions of judges. They are &s;ometimes induced to find &s;pecial verdicts which refer the main que&s;tion to the deci&s;ion of the court. Who would be willing to &s;take his life and his e&s;tate upon the verdict of a jury, acting under the au&s;pices of judges, who had predetermined his guilt?</P>
<P>Would it have been an improvement of the plan to have united the &s;upreme court with the &s;enate in the formation of the court of impeachments? This union would certainly have been attended with &s;everal advantages; but would they not have been overbal|lanced by the &s;ignal di&s;advantage, already &s;tated, ari&s;ing from the agency of the &s;ame judges in the double pro&s;ecution to which the offender would be liable? To a certain extent, the benefits of that union will be obtained from making the chief ju&s;tice of the &s;upreme court, the pre&s;ident of the court of impeachments, as is propo&s;ed to be done in the plan of the convention; while the inconveniencies of an entire incorporation of the former into the latter will be &s;ub&s;tantially avoided. This was perhaps the pru|dent mean. I forbear to remark upon the additional pretext for clamour, again&s;t the judiciary, which &s;o con&s;iderable an augmentation of its authority would have afforded.</P>
<P>Would it have been de&s;irable to have compo&s;ed the court for the trial of impeachments of per&s;ons wholly di&s;tinct from the other departments of the government? There are weighty arguments, as well again&s;t, as in favour of &s;uch a plan. To &s;ome minds, it will not appear a trivial objection, that it would tend to
<PB N="213" REF="021127_0450_0FB24C428B778818">
increa&s;e the complexity of the political machine, and to add a new &s;pring to the government, the utility of which would at be&s;t be que&s;tionable. But an objection which will not be thought by any unworthy of atten|tion, is this.&mdash;A court formed upon &s;uch a plan would either be attended with heavy expence, or might in practice be &s;ubject to a variety of ca&s;ualities and inconveniencies. It mu&s;t either con&s;i&s;t of per|manent officers &s;tationary at the &s;eat of government, and of cour&s;e entitled to fixed and regular &s;tipends, or of certain officers of the &s;tate governments, to be called upon whenever an impeachment was actually depending. It will not be ea&s;y to imagine any third mode materially different, which could rationally be propo&s;ed. As the court, for rea&s;ons already given, ought to be numerous; the fir&s;t &s;cheme will be repro|bated by every man, who can compare the extent of the public wants, with the means of &s;upplying them; the &s;econd will be e&s;pou&s;ed with caution by tho&s;e, who will &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;ider the difficulty of collecting men di&s;per&s;ed over the whole union; the injury to the in|nocent, from the procra&s;tinated determination of the charges which might be brought again&s;t them; the advantage to the guilty, from the opportunities which delay would afford to intrigue and corruption, and in &s;ome ca&s;es the detriment to the &s;tate, from the prolonged inaction of men, who&s;e firm and faithful execution of their duty might have expo&s;ed them to the per&s;ecution of an intemperate or de&s;igning majo|rity in the hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives. Though this latter &s;uppo&s;ition may &s;eem har&s;h, and might not be likely often to be verified; yet it ought not to be forgotten, that the demon of faction will at certain &s;ea&s;ons extend his &s;ceptre over all numerous bodies of men.</P>
<P>But though one or the other of the &s;ub&s;titutes which have been examined, or &s;ome other that might be devi&s;ed, &s;hould be thought preferable to the plan, in this re&s;pect, reported by the convention, it will not
<PB N="214" REF="021127_0451_0FB24C7348C9C950">
follow that the con&s;titution ought for this rea&s;on to be rejected. If mankind were to re&s;olve to agree in no in&s;titution of government, until every part of it had been adju&s;ted to the mo&s;t exact &s;tandard of perfec|tion, &s;ociety would &s;oon become a general &s;cene of anarchy, and the world a de&s;ert. Where is the &s;tandard of perfection to be found? Who will under|take to unite the di&s;cordant opinions of a whole com|munity, in the &s;ame judgement of it; and to pre|vail upon one conceited projector to renounce his <HI>in|fallible</HI> criterion, for the <HI>fallible</HI> criterion of his more <HI>conceited neighbour?</HI> To an&s;wer the purpo&s;e of the adver&s;aries of the con&s;titution, they ought to prove not merely, that particular provi&s;ions in it are not the be&s;t, which might have been imagined; but that the plan upon the whole is bad and pernicious.</P>

<HEAD>NUMBER LXVI. The &s;ame Subject continued.</HEAD>
<P>A REVIEW of the principal objections that have appeared again&s;t the propo&s;ed court for the trial of impeachments, will not improbably eradicate the remains of any unfavorable impre&s;&s;ions which may &s;till exi&s;t, in regard to this matter.</P>
<P>The <HI>fir&s;t</HI> of the&s;e objections is, that the provi&s;ion in que&s;tion confounds legi&s;lative and judiciary autho|rities in the &s;ame body, in violation of that impor|tant and well-e&s;tabli&s;hed maxim, which requires a &s;eparation between the d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">fferent departments of power. The true meaning of this maxim has been di&s;cu&s;&s;ed and a&s;certained in another place, and has been &s;hewn to be entirely compatible with a partial intermixture of tho&s;e departments for &s;pecial pur|po&s;es, pre&s;erving them in the main di&s;tinct and
<PB N="215" REF="021127_0452_0FB24C7D5CC65540">
unconnected. This partial intermixture is even in &s;ome ca&s;es not only proper, but nece&s;&s;ary to the mutual defence of the &s;everal members of the govern|ment again&s;t each other. An ab&s;olute or qualified negative in the executive, upon the acts of the legi&s;|lative body, is admitted by the able&s;t adepts in poli|tical &s;cience, to be an indi&s;pen&s;able barrier again&s;t the encroachments of the latter upon the former. And it may perhaps with not le&s;s rea&s;on, be con|tended, that the powers relating to impeachments are, as before intimated, an e&s;&s;ential check in the hands of that body upon the encroachments of the executive. The divi&s;ion of them between the two branches of the legi&s;lature; a&s;&s;igning to one the right of accu&s;ing, to the other the right of judging; avoids the inconvenience of making the &s;ame per&s;ons both accu&s;ers and judges; and guards again&s;t the danger of per&s;ecution from the prevalency of a factious &s;pirit in either of tho&s;e branches. As the concurrence of two-thirds of the &s;enate will be requi|&s;ite to a condemnation, the &s;ecurity to innocence, from this additional circum&s;tance, will be as com|plete as it&s;elf can de&s;ire.</P>
<P>It is curious to ob&s;erve with what vehemence this part of the plan is a&s;&s;ailed, on the principle here taken notice of, by men who profe&s;s to admire without exception the con&s;titution of this &s;tate; while that con|&s;titution makes the &s;enate, together with the chan|cellor and judges of the &s;upreme court, not only a court of impeachments, but the highe&s;t judicatory in the &s;tate in all cau&s;es, civil and criminal. The pro|portion, in point of numbers, of the chancellor and judges to the &s;enators, is &s;o incon&s;iderable, that the judiciary authority of New-York in the la&s;t re&s;ort may, with truth, be &s;aid to re&s;ide in its &s;enate. If the plan of the convention be in this re&s;pect chargeable with a departure from the celebrated maxim which has been &s;o often mentioned, and &s;eems to be &s;o little
<PB N="216" REF="021127_0453_0FB24C7E6AB18120">
under&s;tood, how much more culpable mu&s;t be the con&s;titution of New-York<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In that of New-Jer&s;ey al&s;o the final judiciary authority is in a branch of the legi&s;lature. In New-Hamp&s;hire, Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, Penn&s;ylvania and South-Carolina, one branch of the legi&s;lative is the court for the trial of impeachments.</NOTE>?</P>
<P>A <HI>&s;econd</HI> objection to the &s;enate, as a court of impeachments, is, that it contributes to an undue accumulation of power in that body, tending to give to the government a countenance too ari&s;tocratic. The &s;enate it is ob&s;erved, is to have concurrent authority with the executive in the formation of treaties, and in the appointment to offices: If, &s;ay the objectors, to the&s;e prerogatives is added that of determining in all ca&s;es of impeachment, it will give a decided pre|dominancy to &s;enatorial influence. To an objection &s;o little preci&s;e in it&s;elf, it is not ea&s;y to find a very preci&s;e an&s;wer. Where is the mea&s;ure or criterion to which we can appeal, for e&s;timating what will give the &s;enate too much, too little, or barely the proper degree of influence? Will it not be more &s;afe, as well as more &s;imple, to di&s;mi&s;s &s;uch vague and uncertain calculations, to examine each power by it&s;elf, and to decide on general principles where it may be depo|&s;ited with mo&s;t advantage and lea&s;t inconvenience?</P>
<P>If we take this cour&s;e it will lead to a more intelli|gible, if not to a more certain re&s;ult. The di&s;po&s;i|tion of the power of making treaties, which has obtained in the plan of the convention, will then, if I mi&s;take not, appear to be fully ju&s;tified by the con|&s;iderations &s;tated in a former number, and by others which will occur under the next head of our enqui|ries. The expediency of the junction of the &s;enate with the executive in the power of appointing to offices will, I tru&s;t, be placed in a light not le&s;s &s;atisfactory, in the di&s;qui&s;itions under the &s;ame head. And I flatter my&s;elf the ob&s;ervations in my la&s;t paper mu&s;t have gone no incon&s;iderable way towards proving that it was not ea&s;y, if practicable, to find a more fit receptacle for the power of determining impeach|ments,
<PB N="217" REF="021127_0454_0FB24C80258DE828">
than that which has been cho&s;en. If this be truly the ca&s;e, the hypothetical danger of the too great weight of the &s;enate ought to be di&s;carded from our rea&s;onings.</P>
<P>But this hypothe&s;is, &s;uch as it is, has already been refuted in the remarks applied to the duration in office pre&s;cribed for the &s;enators. It was by them &s;hewn, as well on the credit of hi&s;torical examples, as from the rea&s;on of the thing, that the mo&s;t <HI>popular</HI> branch of every government, partaking of the repub|lican genius, by being generally the favourite of the people, will be as generally a full match, if not an over|match, for every other member of the government.</P>
<P>But independent of this mo&s;t active and operative principle; to &s;ecure the equilibrium of the national hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives, the plan of the convention has provided in its favour, &s;everal important counter|poi&s;es to the additional authorities, to be conferred upon the &s;enate. The exclu&s;ive privilege of origi|nating money bills will belong to the hou&s;e of repre|&s;entatives. The &s;ame hou&s;e will po&s;&s;e&s;s the &s;ole right of in&s;tituting impeachments: Is not this a complete counterballance to that of determining them?&mdash;The &s;ame hou&s;e will be the umpire in all electons of the pre&s;ident, which do not unite the &s;uffrages of a majo|rity of the whole number of electors; a ca&s;e which it cannot be doubted will &s;ometimes, if not frequently happen. The con&s;tant po&s;&s;ibility of the thing mu&s;t be a fruitful &s;ource of influence to that body. The more it is contemplated, the more important will appear this ultimate, though contingent power of deciding the competitions of the mo&s;t illu&s;trious citi|zens of the union, for the fir&s;t office in it. It would not perhaps be ra&s;h to predict, that as a mean of influ|ence it will be found to outweigh all the peculiar attributes of the &s;enate.</P>
<P>A third objection to the &s;enate as a court of im|peachments is drawn from the agency they are to have in the appointments to office. It is imagined
<PB N="218" REF="021127_0455_0FB24E0D62F4F980">
that they would be too indulgent judges of the con|duct of men, in who&s;e official creation they had par|ticipated. The principle of this objection would condemn a practice, which is to be &s;een in all the &s;tate governments, if not in all the governments, with which we are acquainted: I mean that of ren|dering tho&s;e, who hold offices during plea&s;ure, depen|dent on the plea&s;ure of tho&s;e, who appoint them. With equal plau&s;ibility might it be alledged in this ca&s;e that the favouriti&s;m of the latter would always be an a&s;ylum for the mi&s;behaviour of the former. But that practice, in contradiction to this principle, pro|ceeds upon the pre&s;umption, that the re&s;pon&s;ibility of tho&s;e who appoint, for the fitne&s;s and competency of the per&s;ons, on whom they be&s;tow their choice, and the intere&s;t they have in the re&s;pectable and pro&s;|perous admini&s;tration of affairs, will in&s;pire a &s;uffi|cient di&s;po&s;ition, to di&s;mi&s;s from a &s;hare in it, all &s;uch who, by their conduct, may have proved them&s;elves unworthy of the confidence repo&s;ed in them. Though facts may not always corre&s;pond with this pre&s;umption yet if it be in the main ju&s;t, it mu&s;t de&s;troy the &s;up|po&s;ition, that the &s;enate, who will merely &s;anction the choice of the executive, &s;hould feel a bya&s;s to|wards the objects of that choice, &s;trong enough to blind them to the evidences of guilt &s;o extroardinary as to have induced the repre&s;entatives of the nation to become its accu&s;ers.</P>
<P>If any further argument were nece&s;&s;ary to evince the improbability of &s;uch a bya&s;s, it might be found in the nature of the agency of the &s;enate, in the bu|&s;ine&s;s of appointments. It will be the office of the pre&s;ident to <HI>nominate,</HI> and with the advice and con&s;ent of the &s;enate to <HI>appoint.</HI> There will of cour&s;e be no exertion of <HI>choice</HI> on the part of the &s;enate. They may defeat one choice of the executive, and oblige him to make another; but they cannot them&s;elves <HI>choo&s;e</HI>&mdash;they can only ratify or reject the choice, he may have made. They might even entertain a pre|ference
<PB N="219" REF="021127_0456_0FB24E0EB98E4890">
to &s;ome other per&s;on, at the very moment they were a&s;&s;enting to the one propo&s;ed; becau&s;e there might be no po&s;itive ground of oppo&s;ition to him; and they could not be &s;ure, if they withheld their a&s;&s;ent, that the &s;ub&s;equent nomination would fall upon their own favourite, or upon any other per|&s;on in their e&s;timation more meritorious than the one rejected. Thus it could hardly happen that the ma|jority of the &s;enate would feel any other complacency towards the object of an appointment, than &s;uch, as the appearances of merit, might in&s;pire, and the proofs of the want of it, de&s;troy.</P>
<P>A fourth objection to the &s;enate, in the capacity of a court of impeachments, is derived from their union with the executive in the power of making treaties. This, it has been &s;aid, would con&s;titute the &s;enators their own judges, in every ca&s;e of a corrupt or perfidious execution of that tru&s;t. After having combined with the executive in betraying the intere&s;ts of the nation in a ruinous treaty, what pro|&s;pect, it is a&s;ked, would there be of their being made to &s;uffer the puni&s;hment, they would de&s;erve, when they were them&s;elves to decide upon the accu&s;ation brought again&s;t them for the treachery of which they had been guilty?</P>
<P>This objection has been circulated with more ear|ne&s;tne&s;s and with greater &s;hew of rea&s;on, than any other which has appeared again&s;t this part of the plan; and yet I am deceived if it does not re&s;t upon an erroneous foundation.</P>
<P>The &s;ecurity e&s;&s;entially intended by the con&s;titu|tion again&s;t corruption and treachery in the formation of treaties, is to be &s;ought for in the numbers and characters of tho&s;e who are to make them. The JOINT AGENCY of the chief magi&s;trate of the union, and of two thirds of the members of a body &s;elected by the collective wi&s;dom of the legi&s;latures of the &s;everal &s;tates, is de&s;igned to be the pledge for the fidelity of the national councils in this particular.
<PB N="220" REF="021127_0457_0FB24E185CC91078">
The convention might with propriety have meditated the puni&s;hment of the executive, for a deviation from the in&s;tructions of the &s;enate, or a want of in|tegrity in the conduct of the negotiations committed to him: They might al&s;o have had in view the pu|ni&s;hment of a few leading individuals in the &s;enate, who &s;hould have pro&s;tituted their influence in that body, as the mercenary in&s;truments of foreign cor|ruption: But they could not with more or with equal propriety have contemplated the impeachment and puni&s;hment of two thirds of the &s;enate, con&s;enting to an improper treaty, than of a majority of that or of the other branch of the national legi&s;lature, con|&s;enting to a pernicious or uncon&s;titutional law: a principle which I believe has never been admitted into any government. How in fact could a majority of the hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives, impeach them&s;elves? Not better, it is evident, than two thirds of the &s;enate might try them&s;elves. And yet what rea&s;on is there, that a majority of the hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives, &s;acrificing the intere&s;ts of the &s;ociety, by an unju&s;t and tyrannical act of legi&s;lation, &s;hould e&s;cape with impunity more than two-thirds of the &s;enate, &s;acri|ficing the &s;ame intere&s;ts in an injurious treaty with a foreign power? The truth is, that in all &s;uch ca&s;es it is e&s;&s;ential to the freedom and to the nece&s;&s;ary in|dependence of the deliberations of the body, that the members of it &s;hould be exempt from puni&s;hment for acts done in a collective capacity; and the &s;ecu|rity to the the &s;ociety mu&s;t depend on the care which is taken to confide the tru&s;t to proper hands, to make it their intere&s;t to execute it with fidelity, and to make it as difficult as po&s;&s;ible for them to combine in any intere&s;t oppo&s;ite to that of the public good.</P>
<P>So far as might concern the mi&s;behaviour of the executive in perverting the in&s;tructions, or contra|vening the views of the &s;enate, we need not be ap|prehen&s;ive of the want of a di&s;po&s;ition in that body to puni&s;h the abu&s;e of their confidence, or to vindi|cate
<PB N="221" REF="021127_0458_0FB24E1986CC8250">
their own authority. We may thus far count upon their pride, if not upon their virtue. And &s;o far even as might concern the corruption of leading members, by who&s;e arts and influence the majority may have been inveigled into mea&s;ures odious to the community; if the proofs of that corruption &s;hould be &s;atisfactory, the u&s;ual propen&s;ity of human nature will warrant us in concluding, that there would be commonly no defect of inclination in the body, to divert the public re&s;entment from them&s;elves, by a ready &s;acrifice of the authors of their mi&s;manage|ment and di&s;grace.</P>

<HEAD>NUMBER LXVII. Concerning the Con&s;titution of the Pre&s;ident: A gro&s;s Attempt to mi&s;repre&s;ent this Part of the Plan detected.</HEAD>
<P>THE con&s;titution of the executive department of the propo&s;ed government claims next our attention.</P>
<P>There is hardly any part of the &s;y&s;tem, which could have been attended with greater difficulty in the arrangement of it than this; and there is perhaps none, which has been inveighed again&s;t with le&s;s candor, or critici&s;ed with le&s;s judgement.</P>
<P>Here the writers again&s;t the con&s;titution &s;eem to have taken pains to &s;ignalize their talent of mi&s;repre|&s;entation. Calculating upon the aver&s;ion of the people to monarchy, they have endeavoured to inli&s;t all their jealou&s;ies and apprehen&s;ions in oppo&s;ition to the intended pre&s;ident of the United States; not merely as the embryo but as the full grown progeny of that dete&s;ted parent. To e&s;tabli&s;h the pretended
<PB N="222" REF="021127_0459_0FB24E1B02BA9008">
affinity they have not &s;crupled to draw re&s;ources even from the regions of fiction. The authorities of a magi&s;trate, in few in&s;tances greater, and in &s;ome in&s;tances le&s;s than tho&s;e of a governor of New-York, have been magnified into more than royal preroga|tives. He has been decorated with attributes &s;uperior in dignity and &s;plendor to tho&s;e of a king of Great-Britain. He has been &s;hewn to us with the diadem &s;parkling on his brow, and the imperial purple flow|ing in his train. He has been &s;eated on a throne &s;urrounded with minions and mi&s;tre&s;&s;es; giving audi|ence to the envoys of foreign potentates, in all the &s;upercilious pomp of maje&s;ty. The images of A&s;iatic de&s;poti&s;m and voluptuou&s;ne&s;s have &s;carcely been wanting to crown the exaggerated &s;cene. We have been almo&s;t taught to tremble at the terrific vi&s;ages of murdering jani&s;&s;aries; and to blu&s;h at the unveiled my&s;teries of a future &s;eraglio.</P>
<P>Attempts &s;o extravagant as the&s;e to disfigure, or it might rather be &s;aid, to metamorpho&s;e the object, render it nece&s;&s;ary to take an accurate view of its real nature and form; in order as well to a&s;certain its true a&s;pect and genuine appearance, as to unma&s;k the di&s;ingenuity and expo&s;e the fallacy of the coun|terfeit re&s;emblances which have been &s;o in&s;idiou&s;ly as well as indu&s;triou&s;ly propagated.</P>
<P>In the execution of this ta&s;k there is no man, who would not find it an arduous effort, either to behold with moderation or to treat with &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s the devices not le&s;s weak than wicked, which have been con|trived to pervert the public opinion in relation to the &s;ubject. They &s;o far exceed the u&s;ual, though unju&s;tifiable, licen&s;es of party-artifice, that even in a di&s;po&s;ition the mo&s;t candid and tolerant they mu&s;t force the &s;entiments which favor an indulgent con|&s;truction of the conduct of political adver&s;aries to give place to a voluntary and unre&s;erved indignation. It is impo&s;&s;ible not to be&s;tow the imputation of deli|berate impo&s;ture and deception upon the gro&s;s pre|tence
<PB N="223" REF="021127_0460_0FB24E22EBEA4F40">
of a &s;imilitude between a king of Great-Britain and a magi&s;trate of the character marked out for that of the pre&s;ident of the United States. It is &s;till more impo&s;&s;ible to withold that imputation from the ra&s;h and barefaced expedients which have been employed to give &s;ucce&s;s to the attempted impo&s;ition.</P>
<P>In one in&s;tance, which I cite as a &s;ample of the general &s;pirit, the temerity has proceeded &s;o far as to a&s;cribe to the pre&s;ident of the United States a power, which by the in&s;trument reported is <HI>expre&s;sly</HI> allotted to the executives of the individual &s;tates.&mdash; I mean the power of filling ca&s;ual vacancies in the &s;enate.</P>
<P>This bold experiment upon the di&s;cernment of his countrymen, has been hazarded by a writer who (whatever may be his real merit) has had no incon|&s;iderable &s;hare in the applau&s;es of his party<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Cato, No. 5.</NOTE>;&mdash;and who upon his fal&s;e and unfounded &s;ugge&s;tion, has built a &s;eries of ob&s;ervations equally fal&s;e and unfounded. Let him now be confronted with the evidence of the fact; and let him, if he be able, ju&s;tify or extenuate the &s;hameful outrage he has offered to the dictates of truth and to the rules of fair dealing.</P>
<P>The &s;econd clau&s;e of the &s;econd &s;ection of the &s;econd article empowers the pre&s;ident of the United States
<Q>to nominate, and by and with the advi&s;e and con|&s;ent of the &s;enate to appoint amba&s;&s;adors, other public mini&s;ters and con&s;uls, judges of the &s;upreme court, and all other <HI>officers</HI> of the United States, who&s;e appointments are <HI>not</HI> in the con&s;titution <HI>other|wi&s;e provided for,</HI> and <HI>which &s;hall be e&s;tabli&s;hed by law.</HI></Q>
Immediately after this clau&s;e follows another in the&s;e words&mdash;
<Q>The pre&s;ident &s;hall have power to fill up all <HI>vacancies</HI> that may happen <HI>during the rece&s;s of the &s;enate,</HI> by granting commi&s;&s;ions which &s;hall <HI>expire at the end of their next &s;e&s;&s;ion.</HI></Q>
It is from this la&s;t provi&s;ion that the pretended power of
<PB N="224" REF="021127_0461_0FB24E265799CB38">
the pre&s;ident to fill vacancies in the &s;enate has been deduced. A &s;light attention to the connection of the clau&s;es and to the obvious meaning of the terms will &s;atisfy us that the deduction is not even colourable.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t of the&s;e two clau&s;es it is clear only pro|vides a mode for appointing &s;uch officers,
<Q>who&s;e appointments are <HI>not otherwi&s;e provided for</HI> in the con&s;titution, and which <HI>&s;hall be e&s;tabli&s;hed by law</HI>;</Q>
of cour&s;e it cannot extend to the appointment of &s;e|nators; who&s;e appointments are <HI>otherwi&s;e provided for</HI> in the con&s;titution<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Article 1. &sect; 3. Clau&s;e 1.</NOTE>, and who are <HI>e&s;tabli&s;hed by the con&s;titution,</HI> and will not require a future e&s;tabli&s;h|ment by law. This po&s;ition will hardly be conte&s;ted.</P>
<P>The la&s;t of the&s;e two clau&s;es, it is equally clear, cannot be under&s;tood to comprehend the power of filling vacancies in the &s;enate, for the following rea&s;ons:&mdash;<HI>Fir&s;t.</HI> The relation in which that clau&s;e &s;tands to the other, which declares the general mode of appointing officers of the United States, denotes it to be nothing more than a &s;upplement to the other; for the purpo&s;e of e&s;tabli&s;hing an auxiliary method of appointment, in ca&s;es to which the general method was inadequate. The ordinary power of appointment is confided to the pre&s;ident and &s;enate <HI>jointly,</HI> and can therefore only be exerci&s;ed during the &s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;enate; but as it would have been improper to oblige this body to be continually in &s;e&s;&s;ion for the appointment of officers; and as vacancies might happen <HI>in their rece&s;s,</HI> which it might be nece&s;&s;ary for the public &s;ervice to fill without delay; the &s;ucceed|ing clau&s;e is evidently intended to authori&s;e the pre|&s;ident, <HI>&s;ingly,</HI> to make temporary appointments

The circum&s;tances of the body authori&s;ed to make the per|manent appointments, would of cour&s;e have governed the modification of a power which related to the tem|porary appointments; and as the national &s;enate is the body who&s;e &s;ituation is alone contemplated in the clau&s;e upon which the &s;ugge&s;tion under examination has been founded, the vacancies to which it alludes can only be deemed to re&s;pect tho&s;e officers, in who&s;e appointment that body has a concurrent agency with the pre&s;ident. But, <HI>la&s;tly,</HI> the fir&s;t and &s;econd clau&s;es of the third &s;ection of the fir&s;t article, not only obviate the po&s;&s;ibility of doubt, but de&s;troy the pretext of mi&s;conception.

<Q>the &s;enate of the United States &s;hall be compo&s;ed of two &s;enators from each &s;tate, cho&s;en <HI>by the legi&s;la|ture thereof</HI> for &s;ix years;</Q>

<Q>if vacancies in that body &s;hould happen by re&s;ignation or otherwi&s;e, <HI>during the rece&s;s of the legi&s;lature of</HI> ANY STATE, the executive THEREOF may make temporary appointments until the <HI>next meeting of the legi&s;lature,</HI> which &s;hall then fill &s;uch vacancies.</Q>
Here is an expre&s;s power given, in

clear and unambiguous terms, to the &s;tate executives, to fill the ca&s;ual vacancies in the &s;enate, by tempo|rary appointments; which not only invalidates the &s;uppo&s;ition that the clau&s;e before con&s;idered could have been intended to confer that power upon the pre&s;i|dent of the United States, but proves that this &s;up|po&s;ition, de&s;titute as it is even of the merit of plau&s;i|bility, mu&s;t have originated in an intention to deceive the people, too palpable to be ob&s;cured by &s;ophi&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y, and too atrocious to be palliated by hypocri&s;y.</P>

<HEAD>NUMBER LXVIII. The View of the Con&s;titution of the Pre&s;ident continued, in Relation to the Mode of Ap|pointment.</HEAD>
<P>THE mode of appointment of the chief magi&s;|trate of the United States is almo&s;t the only part of the &s;y&s;tem, of any con&s;equence, which has e&s;caped without &s;evere cen&s;ure, or which has re|ceived the &s;lighte&s;t mark of approbation from its oppo|nents.
<PB N="227" REF="021127_0464_0FB24E2DCD555098">
The mo&s;t plau&s;ible of the&s;e, who has appeared in the print, has even deigned to admit, that the election of the pre&s;ident is pretty well guarded<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide Federal Farmer.</NOTE>. I venture &s;omewhat further, and he&s;itate not to affirm, that if the manner of it be not perfect, it is at lea&s;t excellent. It unites in an eminent degree all the advantages, the union of which was to be de&s;ired.</P>
<P>It was de&s;ireable, that the &s;en&s;e of the people &s;hould operate in the choice of the per&s;on to whom &s;o im|portant a tru&s;t was to be confided, This end will be an&s;wered by committing the right of making it, not to any pre-e&s;tabli&s;hed body, but to men, cho&s;en by the people for the &s;pecial purpo&s;e, and at the parti|cular conjuncture,</P>
<P>It was equally de&s;ireable, that the immediate elec|tion &s;hould be made by men mo&s;t capable of analiz|ing the qualities adapted to the &s;tation, and acting under circum&s;tances favourable to deliberation and to a judicious combination of all the rea&s;ons and in|ducements that were proper to govern their choice. A &s;mall number of per&s;ons, &s;elected by their fellow citizens from the general ma&s;s, will be mo&s;t likely to po&s;&s;e&s;s the information and di&s;cernment requi&s;ite to &s;o complicated an inve&s;tigation.</P>
<P>It was al&s;o peculiarly de&s;ireable, to afford as little opportunity as po&s;&s;ible to tumult and di&s;order. This evil was not lea&s;t to be dreaded in the election of a magi&s;trate, who was to have &s;o important an agency in the admini&s;tration of the government, as the pre&s;ident of the United States. But the precautions which have been &s;o happily concerted in the &s;y&s;tem under con&s;ideration, promi&s;e an effectual &s;ecurity again&s;t this mi&s;chief. The choice of <HI>&s;everal</HI> to form an in|termediate body of electors, will be much le&s;s apt to convul&s;e the community, with any extroardinary or violent movements, than the choice of <HI>one</HI> who was him&s;elf to be the final object of the public wi&s;hes. And as the electors, cho&s;en in each &s;tate, are to
<PB N="228" REF="021127_0465_0FB24E3481FBA508">
a&s;&s;emble and vote in the &s;tate, in which they are cho&s;en, this detached and divided &s;ituation will expo&s;e them much le&s;s to heats and ferments, which might be communicated from them to the people, than if they were all to be convened at one time, in one place.</P>
<P>Nothing was more to be de&s;ired, than that every practicable ob&s;tacle &s;hould be oppo&s;ed to cabal, intrigue and corruption. The&s;e mo&s;t deadly adver|&s;aries of republican government might naturally have been expected to make their approaches from more than one quarter, but chiefly from the de&s;ire in foreign powers to gain an improper a&s;cendant in our councils. How could they better gratify this, than by rai&s;ing a creature of their own to the chief magi|&s;tracy of the un<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">on? But the convention have guarded again&s;t all danger of this &s;ort with the mo&s;t provident and judicious attention. They have not made the appointment of the pre&s;ident to depend on any pre-exi&s;ting bodies of men who might be tampered with beforehand to pro&s;titute their votes; but they have referred it in the fir&s;t in&s;tance to an immediate act of the people of America, to be exerted in the choice of per&s;ons for the temporary and &s;ole purpo&s;e of making the appointment. And they have excluded from elegibility to this tru&s;t, all tho&s;e who from &s;ituation might be &s;u&s;pected of too great devotion to the pre|&s;ident in office. No &s;enator, repre&s;entative, or other per&s;on holding a place of tru&s;t or profit under the United States, can be of the number of the electors. Thus, without corrupting the body of the people, the immediate agents in the election will at lea&s;t enter upon the ta&s;k, free from any &s;ini&s;ter bya&s;s. Their tran&s;ient exi&s;tence, and their detached &s;ituation, already taken notice of, afforded a &s;atisfactory pro&s;|pect of their continuing &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, to the conclu&s;ion of it. The bu&s;ine&s;s of corruption, when it is to embrace &s;o con&s;iderable a number of men, requires time, as well as means. Nor would it be found ea&s;y &s;uddenly to
<PB N="229" REF="021127_0466_0FB24E35EF2722F0">
embark them, di&s;per&s;ed, as they would be over thirteen &s;tates, in any combinations founded upon motives, which though they could not properly be denominated corrupt, might yet be of a nature to mi&s;lead them from their duty.</P>
<P>Another and no le&s;s important de&s;ideratum was, that the executive &s;hould be independent for his con|tinuance in office on all, but the people them&s;elves. He might otherwi&s;e be tempted to &s;acrifice his duty to his complai&s;ance for tho&s;e who&s;e favor was nece&s;&s;ary to the duration of his official con&s;equence. This advantage will al&s;o be &s;ecured, by making his re-election to depend on a &s;pecial body of repre&s;enta|tives, deputed by the &s;ociety for the &s;ingle purpo&s;e of making the important choice.</P>
<P>All the&s;e advantages will be happily combined in the plan devi&s;ed by the convention, which is, that the people of each &s;tate &s;hall choo&s;e a number of per|&s;ons as electors, equal to the number of &s;enators and repre&s;entatives of &s;uch &s;tate in the national govern|ment, who &s;hall a&s;&s;emble within the &s;tate and vote for &s;ome fit per&s;on as pre&s;ident. Their votes, thus given, are to be tran&s;mitted to the &s;eat of the national go|vernment; and the per&s;on who may happen to have a majority of the whole number of votes, will be the pre&s;ident. But as a majority of the votes might not always happen to centre on one man, and as it might be un&s;afe to permit le&s;s than a majority to be conclu|&s;ive, it is provided, that in &s;uch a contingency, the hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives &s;hall &s;elect out of the candi|dates, who &s;hall have the five highe&s;t numbers of votes, the man who in their opinion may be be&s;t qualified for the office.</P>
<P>This proce&s;s of election affords a moral certainty, that the office of pre&s;ident, will never fall to the lot of any man, who is not in an eminent degree endowed with the requi&s;ite qualifications. Talents for low in|trigue and the little arts of popularity may alone &s;uffice to elevate a man to the fir&s;t honours in a &s;ingle &s;tate,
<PB N="230" REF="021127_0467_0FB24E3E36EC9F88">
but it will require other talents and a different kind of merit to e&s;tabli&s;h him in the e&s;teem and confidence of the whole union, or of &s;o con&s;iderable a portion of it as would be nece&s;&s;ary to make him a &s;ucce&s;sful candidate for the di&s;tingui&s;hed office of pre&s;ident of the United States. It will not be too &s;trong to &s;ay, that there will be a con&s;tant probability of &s;eeing the &s;tation filled by characters pre-eminent for ability and virtue. And this will be thought no incon&s;iderable recommendation of the con&s;titution, by tho&s;e, who are able to e&s;timate the &s;hare, which the executive in every government mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have in its good or ill admini&s;tration. Though we cannot acquie&s;ce in the political here&s;y of the poet who &s;ays&mdash;</P>
<L>"For forms of government let fools conte&s;t&mdash;</L>
<L>"That which is be&s;t admini&s;tred is be&s;t."</L>
<P>&mdash;yet we may &s;afely pronounce, that the true te&s;t of a good government is its aptitude and tendency to produce a good admini&s;tration.</P>
<P>The vice-pre&s;ident is to be cho&s;en in the &s;ame manner with the pre&s;ident; with this difference, that the &s;enate is to do, in re&s;pect to the former, what is to be done by the hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives, in re&s;pect to the latter.</P>
<P>The appointment of an extroardinary per&s;on, as vice-pre&s;ident, has been objected to as &s;uperfluous, if not mi&s;chievous. It has been alledged, that it would have been preferable to have authori&s;ed the &s;enate to elect out of their own body an officer, an&s;wering to that de&s;cription. But two con&s;iderations &s;eem to ju&s;tify the ideas of the convention in this re&s;pect. One is, that to &s;ecure at all times the po&s;&s;ibility of a definitive re&s;olution of the body, it is nece&s;&s;ary that the pre&s;ident &s;hould have only a ca&s;ting vote. And to take the &s;enator of any &s;tate from his &s;eat as &s;enator, to place him in that of pre&s;ident of the &s;enate, would be to exchange, in regard to the &s;tate from which he came, a con&s;tant for a contingent
<PB N="231" REF="021127_0468_0FB24E3FEC82F560">
vote. The other con&s;ideration is, that as the vice-pre&s;ident may occa&s;ionally become a &s;ub&s;ti&s;tute for the pre&s;ident, in the &s;upreme executive magi&s;tracy, all the rea&s;ons, which recommend the mode of elec|tion pre&s;cribed for the one, apply with great, if not with equal force to the manner of appointing the other. It is remarkable, that in this as in mo&s;t other in&s;tances, the objection which is made, would lie again&s;t the con&s;titution of this &s;tate. We have a lieute|nant-governor cho&s;en by the people at large, who pre|&s;ides in the &s;enate, and is the con&s;titutional &s;ub&s;titute for the governor in ca&s;ualties &s;imilar to tho&s;e, which would authori&s;e the vice-pre&s;ident to exerci&s;e the au|thorities and di&s;charge the duties of the pre&s;ident.</P>

<HEAD>NUMBER LXIX. The &s;ame View continued, with a Compari&s;on between the Pre&s;ident and the King of Great-Britain on the one Hand, and the Governor of New-York on the other.</HEAD>
<P>I PROCEED now to trace the real characters of the propo&s;ed executive as they are marked out in the plan of the convention. This will &s;erve to place in a &s;trong light the unfairne&s;s of the repre&s;entations which have been made in regard to it.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t thing which &s;trikes our attention is, that the executive authority, with few exceptions, is to be ve&s;ted in a &s;ingle magi&s;trate. This will &s;carcely, however, be con&s;idered as a point upon which any compari&s;on can be grounded; for if in this par<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">icu|lar there be a re&s;emblance to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he king of Great Bri|tain, there is not le&s;s a re&s;emblance to the Grand Signior, to the Khan of Tartary, to the man of the &s;even mountains, or to the governor of New-York.</P>
<P>That magi&s;trate is to be elected for <HI>four</HI> years; and is to be re-eligible as often as the people of the
<PB N="232" REF="021127_0469_0FB24E48CBD5E840">
United States &s;hall think him worthy of their confi|dence. In the&s;e circum&s;tances, there is a total di&s;|&s;imilitude between <HI>him</HI> and a king of Great-Britain; who is an <HI>hereditary</HI> monarch, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the crown as a patrimony de&s;cendible to his heirs forever; but there is a clo&s;e analogy between <HI>him</HI> and a governor of New-York, who is elected for <HI>three</HI> years, and is re-eligible without limitation or intermi&s;&s;ion. If we con&s;ider how much le&s;s time would be requi&s;ite for e&s;tabli&s;hing a dangerous influence in a &s;ingle &s;tate, than for e&s;tabli&s;hing a like influence throughout the United States, we mu&s;t conclude that a duration of <HI>four</HI> years for the chief magi&s;trate of the union, is a degree of permanency far le&s;s to be dreaded in that office, than a duration of <HI>three</HI> years for a corre&s;pon|dent office in a &s;ingle &s;tate.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ident of the United States would be liable to be impeached, tried, and upon conviction of trea&s;on, bribery, or other high crimes or mi&s;de|meanors, removed from office; and would afterwards be liable to pro&s;ecution and puni&s;hment in the ordi|nary cour&s;e of law. The per&s;on of the king of Great-Britain is &s;acred and inviolable: There is no con|&s;titutional tribunal to which he is amenable; no puni&s;hment to which he can be &s;ubjected without involving the cri&s;is of a national revolution. In this delicate and important circum&s;tance of per&s;onal re&s;pon&s;ibility, the pre&s;ident of confederated America would &s;tand upon no better ground than a governor of New-York, and upon wor&s;e ground than the governors of Virginia and Delaware.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ident of the United States is to have power to return a bill, which &s;hall have pa&s;&s;ed the two branches of the legi&s;lature, for re-con&s;ideration; and the bill &s;o returned is not to become a law, unle&s;s upon that re-con&s;ideration it be approved by two thirds of both hou&s;es. The king of Great-Britain, on his part has an ab&s;olute negative upon the acts of the two hou&s;es of parliament. The di&s;u&s;e of that power for
<PB N="233" REF="021127_0470_0FB24E4A3283D6C8">
a con&s;iderable time pa&s;t, does not affect the reality of its exi&s;tence; and is to be a&s;cribed wholly to the crown's having found the means of &s;ub&s;tituting influ|ence to authority, or the art of gaining a majority in one or the other of the two hou&s;es, to the nece&s;&s;ity of exerting a prerogative which could &s;eldom be exerted without hazarding &s;ome degree of national agitation. The qualified negative of the pre&s;ident differs widely from this ab&s;olute negative of the Briti&s;h &s;overeign; and tallies exactly with the revi&s;ionary authority of the council of revi&s;ion of this &s;tate, of which the governor is a con&s;tituent part. In this re&s;pect, the power of the pre&s;ident would exceed that of the gover|nor of New-York; becau&s;e the former would po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;ingly what the latter &s;hares with the chancellor and judges: But it would be preci&s;ely the &s;ame with that of the governor of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, who&s;e con&s;titution, as to this article, &s;eems to have been the original from which the convention have copied.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ident is to be the
<Q>commander in chief of the army and navy of the United States, and of the militia of the &s;eve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">al &s;tates when called into the actual &s;ervice of the United States. He is to have power to grant reprieves and pardons for offences again&s;t the United States <HI>except in ca&s;es of impeach|ment</HI>; to recommend to the con&s;ideration of con|gre&s;s &s;uch mea&s;ures as he &s;hall judge nece&s;&s;ary and expedient; to convene on extraordinary occa&s;ions both hou&s;es of the legi&s;lature, or either of them, and in ca&s;e of di&s;agreement between them <HI>with re&s;pect to the time of adjournment,</HI> to adjourn them to &s;uch time as he &s;hall think proper; to take care that the laws be faithfully executed; and to commi&s;&s;ion all officers of the United States.</Q>
In mo&s;t of the&s;e particulars the power of the pre&s;ident will re&s;emble equally that of the king of Great-Britain and of the governor of New-York. The mo&s;t material points of difference are the&s;e:&mdash;<HI>Fir&s;t.</HI> The pre&s;ident will have only the occa&s;ional command of &s;uch part of the

militia of the nation, as by legi&s;lative provi&s;ion may be called into the actual &s;ervice of the union. The king of Great-Britain and the governor of New-York, have at all times the entire command of all the militia within their &s;everal juri&s;dictons. In this article therefore the power of the pre&s;ident would be inferior to that of either the monarch or the governor. <HI>Second.</HI> The pre&s;ident is to be commander in chief of the army and navy of the United States. In his re&s;pect his authority would be nominally the &s;ame with that of the king of Great-Britain, but in &s;ub&s;tance much inferior to it. It would amount to nothing more than the &s;upreme command and direction of the military and naval forces, as fir&s;t general and admiral of the confederacy; while that of the Briti&s;h king extends to the <HI>declaring</HI> of war, and to the <HI>rai&s;ing</HI> and <HI>regu|lating</HI> of fleets and armies; all which by the con&s;ti|tution under con&s;ideration, would appertain to the legi&s;la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ure.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A writer in a Penn&s;ylvania paper, under the &s;ignature of TAMONY, has a&s;&s;erted that the king of Great-Britain owes his prerogatives as commander in chief to an annual mutiny bill. The truth is on the contrary, that his prerogative in this re&s;pect is immemorial, and was only di&s;puted
<Q>contrary to all rea&s;on and precedent,</Q>
as Black&s;tone, vol. 1. page 262, expre&s;&s;es it, by the long parliament of Charles Fir&s;t; but by the &s;tatute the 13th of Charles Second, chap. 6. it was declared to be in the king alone, for that the &s;ole &s;upreme government and command of the militia within his maje&s;ty's realms and dominions, and of all forces by &s;ea and land, and of all forts and places of &s;trength, EVER WAS AND IS the undoubted right of his maje&s;ty and his royal predece&s;&s;ors kings and queens of England, and that both or either hou&s;e of parliament cannot nor ought to pretend to the &s;ame.</NOTE> The governor of New-York, on the other hand, is by the con&s;titution of the &s;tate ve&s;ted only with the command of its militia and navy. But the con&s;titutions of &s;everal of the &s;tates, expre&s;sly de|clare their governors to be commanders in chief as well of the army as navy; and it may well be a que&s;|tion whether tho&s;e of New-Hamp&s;hire and Ma&s;&s;achu|&s;etts, in particular, do not in this in&s;tance confer larger powers upon their re&s;pective governors, than could be claimed by a pre&s;ident of the United States.

<HI>Third.</HI> The power of the pre&s;ident in re&s;pect to par|dons would extend to all ca&s;es, <HI>except tho&s;e of impeach|ment.</HI> The governor of New-York may pardon in all ca&s;es, even in tho&s;e of impeachment, except for trea&s;on and murder. Is not the power of the gover|nor in this article, on a calculation of political con&s;e|quences, greater than that of the pre&s;ident? All con|&s;piracies and plots again&s;t the government, which have not been matured into actual trea&s;on, may be &s;creened from puni&s;hment of every kind, by the inter|po&s;ition of the prerogative of pardoning. If a gover|nor of New-York therefore &s;hould be at the head of any &s;uch con&s;piracy, until the de&s;ign had been ripened into actual ho&s;tility, he could en&s;ure his accomplices and adherents an entire impunity. A pre&s;ident of the union on the other hand, though he may even pardon trea&s;on, when pro&s;ecuted in the ordinary cour&s;e of law, could &s;helter no offender in any degree from the effects of impeachment and conviction. Would not the pro&s;pect of a total indemnity for all the preliminary &s;teps be a greater temptation to undertake and per&s;evere in an enterpri&s;e again&s;t the public liberty than the mere pro&s;pect of an exemption from death and confi&s;cation, if the final execution of the de&s;ign, upon an actual appeal to arms, &s;hould mi&s;carry? Would this la&s;t expectation have any influ|ence at all, when the probability was computed that the per&s;on who was to afford that exemption might him&s;elf be involved in the con&s;equences of the mea|&s;ure; and might be incapacitated by his agency in it, from affording the de&s;ired impunity? The better to judge of this matter, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to recollect that by the propo&s;ed con&s;titution the offence of trea&s;on is limited

of adjournment. The Briti&s;h monarch may prorogue or even di&s;&s;olve the parliament. The governor of New-York may al&s;o prorogue the legi&s;lature of this &s;tate for a limited time; a power which in cer|tain &s;ituations may be employed to very important purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ident is to have power with the advice and con&s;ent of the &s;enate to make treaties; provided two thirds of the &s;enators pre&s;ent concur. The king of Great-Britain is the &s;ole and ab&s;olute repre&s;entative of the nation in all foreign tran&s;actions. He can of his own accord make treaties of peace, commerce, alliance, and of every other de&s;cription. It has been in&s;inuated, that his authority in this re&s;pect is not conclu&s;ive, and that his conventions with foreign powers are &s;ubject to the revi&s;ion, and &s;tand in need of the ratification of parliament. But I believe this doc|trine was never heard of till it was broached upon the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion. Every juri&s;t<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide Black&s;tone's Commentaries, vol. 1. page 257.</NOTE> of that kingdom and every other man acquainted with its con&s;titution knows, as an e&s;tabli&s;hed fact, that the prerogative of making treaties exi&s;ts in the crown in its utmo&s;t ple|nitude; and that the compacts entered into by the royal authority have the mo&s;t complete legal validity and perfection, independent of any other &s;anction. The parliament, it is true, is &s;ometimes &s;een employ|ing it&s;el<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> in altering the exi&s;ting laws to conform them to the &s;tipulations in a new treaty; and this may have po&s;&s;ibly given birth to the imagination that its co|operation was nece&s;&s;ary to the obligatory efficacy of the treaty. But this parliamentary interpo&s;ition pro|ceeds from a different cau&s;e; from the nece&s;&s;ity of adju&s;ting a mo&s;t artificial and intricate &s;y&s;tem of revenue and commercial laws to the changes made in them by the operation of the treaty; and of adapting new provi&s;ions and precautions to the new &s;tate of things, to keep the machine from running into di&s;or|der. In this re&s;pect therefore, there is no compa|ri&s;on

between the intended power of the pre&s;ident, and the actual power of the Briti&s;h &s;overeign. The one can perform alone what the other can only do with the concurrence of a branch of the legi&s;lature. It mu&s;t be admitted that in this in&s;tance the power of the federal executive would exceed that of any &s;tate executive. But this ari&s;es naturally from the exclu&s;ive po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion by the union of that part of the &s;overeign power which relates to treaties. If the confederacy were to be di&s;&s;olved, it would become a que&s;tion, whether the executives of the &s;everal &s;tates were not &s;olely inve&s;ted with that delicate and important prerogative.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ident is al&s;o to be authori&s;ed to receive amba&s;&s;adors and other public mini&s;ters. This, though it has been a rich theme of declamation, is more a matter of dignity than of authority. It is a cir|cum&s;tance, which will be without con&s;equence in the admini&s;tration of the government; and it was far more convenient that it &s;hould be arranged in this manner, than that there &s;hould be a nece&s;&s;ity of con|vening the legi&s;lature, or one of its branches, upon every arrival of a foreign mini&s;ter; though it were merely to take the place of a departed predece&s;&s;or.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ident is to nominate, and <HI>with the advice and con&s;ent of the &s;enate</HI> to appoint amba&s;&s;adors and other public mini&s;ters, judges of the &s;upreme court, and in general all officers of the United States e&s;ta|bli&s;hed by law, and who&s;e appointments are not other|wi&s;e provided for by the con&s;titution. The king of Great-Britain is emphatically and truly &s;tiled the fountain of honor. He not only appoints to all offices, but can create offices. He can confer titles of nobi|lity at plea&s;ure; and has the di&s;po&s;al of an immen&s;e number of church preferments. There is evidently a great inferiority, in the power of the pre&s;ident in this particular, to that of the Briti&s;h king; nor is it equal to that of the governor of New-York, if we are to interpret the meaning of the con&s;titution of the

&s;tate by the practice which has obtained under it. The power of appointment is with us lodged in a council compo&s;ed of the governor and four members of the &s;enate cho&s;en by the a&s;&s;embly.

If he really has the right of nominating, his authority is in this re&s;pect equal to that of the pre&s;i|dent, and exceeds it in the article of the ca&s;ting vote.

And independent of this claim, when we take into view the other con&s;iderations and pur&s;ue them through all their con&s;equences, we &s;hall be inclined to draw much the &s;ame conclu&s;ion.</NOTE>.

<P>Hence it appears, that except as to the concur|rent authority of the pre&s;ident in the article of trea|ties, it would be difficult to determine whether that magi&s;trate would in the aggregate po&s;&s;e&s;s more or le&s;s power than the governor of New-York. And it

appears yet more unequivocally that there is no pretence for the parallel which has been attempted between him and the king of Great-Britain. But to render the contra&s;t, in this re&s;pect, &s;till more &s;triking, it may be of u&s;e to throw the principal circum&s;tances of di&s;&s;imilitude into a clo&s;er groupe.</P>

<HEAD>NUMBER LXXX. The &s;ame View continued in Relation to the <HI>UNITY</HI> of the Executive, and with an Examination of the Project of an Executive Council.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is an idea, which is not without its advo|cates, that a vigorous executive is incon&s;i&s;tent with the genius of republican government. The enlightened well wi&s;hers to this &s;pecies of government mu&s;t at lea&s;t hope that the &s;uppo&s;ition is de&s;titute of foundation; &s;ince they can never admit its truth, without at the &s;ame time admitting the condemnation of their own principles. Energy in the executive is a leading character in the definition of good govern|ment. It is e&s;&s;ential to the protection of the com|munity again&s;t foreign attacks: It is not le&s;s e&s;&s;ential to the &s;teady admini&s;tration of the laws, to the pro|tection of property again&s;t tho&s;e irregular and high-handed combinations, which &s;ometimes interrupt the ordinary cour&s;e of ju&s;tice, to the &s;ecurity of liberty again&s;t the enterpri&s;es and a&s;&s;aults of ambition, of faction and of anarchy. Every man the lea&s;t conver|&s;ant in Roman &s;tory, knows how often that republic was obliged to take refuge in the ab&s;olute power of a &s;ingle man, under the formidable title of dictator, as well again&s;t the intrigues of ambitious individuals, who a&s;pired to the tyranny, and the &s;editions of whole cla&s;&s;es of the community, who&s;e conduct threatened the exi&s;tence of all government, as again&s;t
<PB N="241" REF="021127_0478_0FB24E650EACBAA8">
the inva&s;ions of external enemies, who menaced the conque&s;t and de&s;truction of Rome.</P>
<P>There can be no need however, to multiply argu|ments or examples on this head. A feeble executive implies a feeble execution of the government. A feeble execution is but another phra&s;e for a bad exe|cution: And a government ill executed, whatever it may be in theory, mu&s;t be in practice a bad government.</P>
<P>Taking it for granted, therefore, that all men of &s;en&s;e will agree in the nece&s;&s;ity of an energetic exe|cutive, it will only remain to inquire, what are the ingredients which con&s;titute this energy&mdash;how far can they be combined with tho&s;e other ingredients which con&s;titute &s;afety in the republican &s;en&s;e? And how far does this combination characteri&s;e the plan which has been reported by the convention?</P>
<P>The ingredients which con&s;titute energy in the executive, are, unity&mdash;duration&mdash;an adequate pro|vi&s;ion for its &s;upport&mdash;competent powers.</P>
<P>The ingredients which con&s;titute &s;afety in the republican &s;en&s;e are, a due dependence on the people&mdash;a due re&s;pon&s;ibility.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e politicians and &s;tate&s;men, who have been the mo&s;t celebrated for the &s;oundne&s;s of their princi|ples, and for the ju&s;tne&s;s of their views, have declared in favor of a &s;ingle executive and a numerous legi&s;|lative. They have with great propriety con&s;idered energy as the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary qualification of the former, and have regarded this as mo&s;t applicable to power in a &s;ingle h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nd; while they have with equal propriety con&s;idered the latter as be&s;t adapted to deliberation and wi&s;dom, and be&s;t ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">culated to conciliate the confidence of the people, and to &s;ecure their privileges and intere&s;ts.</P>
<P>That unity is condu&s;ive to energy will not be di&s;puted. Deci&s;ion, act<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ity, &s;ecrecy and di&s;patch, will generally characteri&s;e the proceedings of one man,
<PB N="242" REF="021127_0479_0FB24E6A02BC41A0">
in a much more eminent degree than the proceed|ings of any greater number; and in proportion as the number is increa&s;ed, the&s;e qualities will be dimini&s;hed.</P>
<P>This unity may be de&s;troyed in two ways; either by ve&s;ting the power in two or more mag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;trates of equal dignity and authority; or by ve&s;ting it o&s;ten&s;i|bly in one man, &s;ubject in whole or in part to the controul and co-operation of others, in the capacity of coun&s;ellors, to him. Of the fir&s;t the two con&s;uls of Rome may &s;erve as an example; of the la&s;t we &s;hall find examples in the con&s;titutions of &s;everal of the &s;tates. New-York, and New-Jer&s;ey, if I recollect right, are the only &s;tates, which have entru&s;ted the executive authority wholly to &s;ingle men<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">New York has no council except for the &s;ingle purpo&s;e of appointing to offices; New-Jer&s;ey has a council, whom the governor m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y con&s;ult. But I think from the terms of the con|&s;titution their re&s;olutions do not bind him.</NOTE>. Both the&s;e methods of de&s;troying the unity of the execu|tive have their parti&s;ans; but the votaries of an exe|cutive council are the mo&s;t numerous. They are both liable, if not to equal, to &s;imilar objections, and may in mo&s;t lights be examined in conjunction.</P>
<P>The experience of other nations will afford little in&s;truction on this head. As far however as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t teaches any thing, it teaches us not to be enamoured o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> plu|rality in the executive. We have &s;een that the Achaeans on an experiment of two prae<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ors, were in|duced to aboli&s;h one. The Roman hi&s;tory records many in&s;tances of mi&s;chiefs to the republic from the di&s;&s;entions between the con&s;uls, and between the m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">litary tribunes, who were at times &s;ub&s;tituted to the con&s;uls. But it gives us no &s;pecimens of any peculiar advantages derived to the &s;tate, from the plurality of tho&s;e magi&s;trates. That the di&s;&s;en|tions between them were not more frequent or mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e fatal, is matter of a&s;toni&s;hment; until we advert to the &s;ingular po&s;ition in which the republ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">c was almo&s;t continually placed, and to the prudent
<PB N="243" REF="021127_0480_0FB24E6E11DAB1A8">
policy pointed out by the circum&s;tances of the &s;tate, and pur&s;ued by the con&s;uls, of making a divi&s;ion of the government between them. The patricians en|gaged in a perpetual &s;truggle with the plebeians for the pre&s;ervation of their antient authorities and dignities; the con&s;uls, who were generally cho&s;en out of the former body, were commonly united by the per&s;onal intere&s;t they had in the defence of the pri|vileges of their order. In addition to this motive of union, after the arms of the republic had con&s;iderably expanded the bounds of its empire, it became an e&s;tabli&s;hed cu&s;tom with the con&s;uls to divide the admini&s;tration between them&s;elves by lot; one of them remaining at Rome to govern the city and its environs; the other taking the command in the more di&s;tant provinces. This expedient mu&s;t no doubt have had great influence in preventing tho&s;e colli&s;ions and rival&s;hips, which might otherwi&s;e have embroiled the republic.</P>
<P>But quitting the dim light of hi&s;torical re&s;earch, and attaching our&s;elves purely to the dictates of rea|&s;on and good &s;en&s;e, we &s;hall di&s;cover much greater cau&s;e to reject than to approve the idea of plurality in the executive, under any modification whatever.</P>
<P>Wherever two or more per&s;ons are engaged in any common enterprize or pur&s;uit, there is always danger of difference of opinion. If it be a public tru&s;t or office in which they are cloathed with equal dignity and authority, there is peculiar danger of per&s;onal emulation and even animo&s;ity. From either and e&s;pecially from all the&s;e cau&s;es, the mo&s;t bitter di&s;|&s;entions are apt to &s;pring. Whenever the&s;e happen, they le&s;&s;en the re&s;pectability, weaken the authority, and di&s;tract the plans and operations of tho&s;e whom they divide. If they &s;hould unfortunately a&s;&s;ail the &s;upreme executive magi&s;tracy of a country, con&s;i&s;ting of a plurality of per&s;ons, they might impede or fru&s;|trate the mo&s;t important mea&s;ures of the government in the mo&s;t critical emergencies of the &s;tate. And

what is &s;till wor&s;e they might &s;plit the community into violent and irreconciliable factions, adhering differently to the different individuals who compo&s;ed the magi&s;tracy.</P>
<P>Men often oppo&s;e a thing merely becau&s;e they have had no agency in planning it, or becau&s;e it may have been planned by tho&s;e whom they di&s;like But if they have been con&s;ulted and have happened to di&s;approve, oppo&s;ition then becomes in their e&s;timation an indi&s;|pen&s;ible duty of &s;elf love. They &s;eem to think them|&s;elves bound in honor, and by all the motives of per|&s;onal infallibility to defeat the &s;ucce&s;s of what has been re&s;olved upon, contrary to their &s;entiments. Men of upright and benevolent tempers have too many op|portunities of remarking with horror, to what de&s;|perate lengths this di&s;po&s;ition is &s;ometimes carried, and how often the great intere&s;ts of &s;ociety are &s;acri|ficed to the vanity, to the conceit and to the ob&s;tinacy of individvals, who have credit enough to make their pa&s;&s;ions and their caprices in er<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ting to mankind. Perhaps the que&s;tion now before the public may in its con&s;equences afford melancholy proofs of the effects of this de&s;picable frailty, or rather dete&s;table vice in the human character.</P>
<P>Upon the principles of a free government, incon|veniencies from the &s;ource ju&s;t mentioned mu&s;t ne|ce&s;&s;arily be &s;ubmitted to in the formation of the le|gi&s;lature; but it is unnece&s;&s;ary and therefore unwi&s;e to introduce them into the con&s;titution of the exe|cutive. It is here too that they may be mo&s;t perni|cious. In the legi&s;lature, promptitude of deci&s;ion is oftener an evil than a benefit. The differences of opinion, and the jarrings of parties in that depart|ment of the government, though they may &s;ometimes ob&s;truct &s;alutary plans, yet often promote diliberation and circum&s;pection; and &s;erve to check exce&s;&s;es in the majority. When a re&s;olution too is once taken, the oppo&s;ition mu&s;t be at an end. That re&s;olution is a law, and re&s;i&s;tance to it puni&s;hable. But no favourable

circum&s;tances palliate or atone for the di&s;advantages of di&s;&s;ention in the executive department. Here they are pure and unmixed. There is no point at which they cea&s;e to operate. They &s;erve to embarra&s;s and weaken the execution of the plan or mea&s;ure, to which they relate, from the fir&s;t &s;tep to the final con|clu&s;ion of it. They con&s;tantly counteract tho&s;e qua|lities in the executive, which are the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary ingredients in its compo&s;ition, vigour and expedition, and this without any counterballancing good. In the conduct of war, in which the energy of the executive is the bulwark of the national &s;ecurity, every thing would be to be apprehended from its plural<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ty.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed that the&s;e ob&s;ervations apply with principal weight to the fir&s;t ca&s;e &s;uppo&s;ed, that is to a plurality of magi&s;trates of equal dignity and authority; a &s;cheme the advocates for which are not likely to form a numerous &s;ect: But they apply, though not with equal, yet with con&s;iderable weight, to the project of a council, who&s;e concurrence is made con&s;titutionally nece&s;&s;ary to the operations of the often&s;ible executive. An artful cabal in that council would be able to di&s;tract and to enervate the whole &s;y&s;tem of admini&s;tration. If no &s;uch cabal &s;hould exi&s;t, the mere diver&s;ity of views and opinions would alone be &s;ufficient to tincture the exerci&s;e of the exe|cutive authority with a &s;pirit of habitual feeblene&s;s and dilatorine&s;s.</P>
<P>But one of the weightie&s;t objections to a plurality in the executive, and which lies as much again&s;t the la&s;t as the fir&s;t plan, is that it tends to conceal faults, and de&s;troy re&s;pon&s;ibility. Re&s;pon&s;ibility is of two kinds, to cen&s;ure and to puni&s;hment. The fir&s;t is the mo&s;t important of the two; e&s;pecially in an elec|tive office. Men, in public tru&s;t, will much oftener act in &s;uch a manner as to render them unworthy of being any longer tru&s;ted, than in &s;uch a manner as to make them obnoxious to legal puni&s;hment. But the multiplication of the executive adds to the diffi|culty
<PB N="246" REF="021127_0483_0FB24E742E878B78">
of detection in either ca&s;e. It often becomes impo&s;&s;ible, amid&s;t mutual accu&s;ations, to determine on whom the blame or the puni&s;hment of a pernicious mea&s;ure, or &s;eries of pernicious mea&s;ures ought really to fall. It is &s;hifted from one to another with &s;o much dexterity, and under &s;uch plau&s;ible appearances, that the public opinion is left in &s;u&s;pen&s;e about the real author. The circum&s;tances which may have led to any national mi&s;carriage or misfortune are &s;ometimes &s;o complicated, that where there are a number of actors who may have had different degrees and kinds of agency, though we may clearly &s;ee upon the whole that there has been mi&s;management, yet it may be impracticable to pronounce to who&s;e account the evil which may have been incurred is truly chargeable.</P>
<P><Q>I was overruled by my council. The council were &s;o divided in their opinions, that it was im|po&s;&s;ible to obtain any better re&s;olution on the point.</Q>

at a lo&s;s to determine by who&s;e influence their in|tere&s;ts have been committed to hands &s;o unqualified, and &s;o manife&s;tly improper. In tenderne&s;s to indi|viduals, I forbear to de&s;cend to particulars.</P>
<P>It is evident from the&s;e con&s;iderations, that the plurality of the executive tends to deprive the people of the two greate&s;t &s;ecurities they can have for the faithful exerci&s;e of any delegated power. <HI>Fir&s;t.</HI> The re&s;traints of public opinion, which lo&s;e their efficacy as well on account of the divi&s;ion of the cen&s;ure atten|dant on bad mea&s;ures among a number, as on ac|count of the uncertainty on whom it ought to fall; and <HI>&s;econdly,</HI> the opportunity of di&s;covering with faci|lity and clearne&s;s the mi&s;conduct of the per&s;ons they tru&s;t, in order either to their removal from office, or to their actual puni&s;hment, in ca&s;es which admit of it.</P>
<P>In England the king is a perpetual magi&s;trate; and it is a maxim which has obtained for the &s;ake of the public peace, that he is unaccountable for his admi|ni&s;tration, and his per&s;on &s;acred. Nothing therefore can be wi&s;er in that kingdom than to annex to the king a con&s;titutional council, who may be re&s;pon&s;ible to the nation for the advice they give. Without this there would be no re&s;pon&s;ibility whatever in the exe|cutive department, an idea inadmi&s;&s;ible in a free go|vernment. But even there the king is not bound by the re&s;olutions of his council, though they are an&s;wer|able for the advice they give. He is the ab&s;olute ma&s;ter of his own conduct in the exerci&s;e of his office; and may ob&s;erve or di&s;regard the coun&s;el given to him at his &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">le di&s;cretion.</P>
<P>But in a republic, where every magi&s;trate ought to be per&s;onally re&s;pon&s;ible for his behaviour in office, the rea&s;on which in the Briti&s;h con&s;titution dictates the propriety of a council, not only cea&s;es to apply, but turns again&s;t the in&s;titution. In the monarchy of Great-Britain, it furni&s;hes a &s;ub&s;titute for the pro|hibited re&s;pon&s;ibility of the chief magi&s;trate; which
<PB N="248" REF="021127_0485_0FB24E7736B42A68">
&s;erves in &s;ome degree as a ho&s;tage to the national ju&s;tice for his good behaviour. In the American re|public it would &s;erve to de&s;troy, or would greatly dimini&s;h the intended and nece&s;&s;ary re&s;pon&s;ibility of the chief magi&s;trate him&s;elf.</P>
<P>The idea of a council to the executive, which has &s;o generally obtained in the &s;tate con&s;titutions, has been derived from that maxim of republican jealou&s;y which con&s;iders power as &s;afer in the hands of a num|ber of men than of a &s;ingle man. It the maxim &s;hould be admitted to be applicable to the ca&s;e, I &s;hould contend that the advantage on that &s;ide would no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> counterballance the numerous di&s;advantages on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide. But I do not think the rule at all applicable to the executive power. I clearly concur in opinion in this particular with a writer whom the celebrated Junius pronounces to be
<Q>deep, &s;olid and ingenious,</Q>
that
<Q>the executive power is more ea&s;ily confined when it is ONE<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">De Loime.</NOTE>:</Q>
That it is far more &s;afe here &s;hould be a &s;ingle object for the jea|lou&s;y and watchfulne&s;s of the people; and in a word, that all multiplication of the executive is rather dan|gerous than friendly to liberty.</P>
<P>A little con&s;id<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ration will &s;atisfy us, that the &s;pecies of &s;ecurity &s;ought for in the multiplication of the executive is unattainable. Numbers mu&s;t be &s;o great as to render combination difficult; or they are rather a &s;ource of danger than of &s;ecurity The united credit and influence of &s;everal individuals mu&s;t be more formidable to liberty than the credit and in|fluence of either of them &s;eparately. When power therefore is placed in the hands of &s;o &s;mall a number of men, as to admit of their intere&s;ts and views being ea&s;ily combined in a common enterprize, by an artful leader, it becomes more liable to abu&s;e, and more dangerous when abu&s;ed, than if it be lodged in the hands of one man; who, from the very circum&s;tance

The decemvirs of Rome, who&s;e name de|notes their number<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ten.</NOTE>, were more to be dreaded in their u&s;urpation than any ONE of them would have been. No per&s;on would think of propo&s;ing an executive much more numerous than that body; from &s;ix to a dozen have been &s;ugge&s;ted for the number of the council. The extreme of the&s;e numbers is not too great for an ea&s;y combination; and from &s;uch a combination America would have more to fear, than from the ambition of any &s;ingle individual. A council to a magi&s;trate, who is him&s;elf re&s;pon&s;ible for what he does, are generally nothing better than a clog upon his good intentions; are often the in&s;truments and accomplices of his bad, and are almo&s;t always a cloak to his faults.</P>
<P>I forbear to dwell upon the &s;ubject of expence&punc; though it be evident that if the council &s;hould be numerous enough to an&s;wer the principal end, aimed at by the in&s;titution, the &s;alaries o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the members, who mu&s;t b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> drawn from the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> homes to re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">de at the &s;ea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> government, would form an i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">em in the cata|logue of public expenditures, too &s;erious to be in|curred for an object of equivocal utility.</P>

<HEAD>NUMBER LXXI. The &s;ame View continued, in regard to the Duration of the Office.</HEAD>
<P>DURATION in office has been mentioned as the &s;econd requi&s;ite to the energy of the executive authority. This has relation to two objects: To the per&s;onal firmne&s;s of the executive magi&s;trate in the employment of his con&s;titutional powers; and to the &s;tability of the &s;y&s;tem of admini&s;tration which may have been adopted under his au&s;pices. With regard to the fir&s;t, it mu&s;t be evident, that the longer the duration in office, the greater will be the proba|bility of obtaining &s;o important an advantage. It is a general principle of human nature, that a man will be intere&s;ted in whatever he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, in proportion to the firmne&s;s or precariou&s;ne&s;s of the tenure, by which he holds it; will be le&s;s attached to what he holds by a momentary or uncertain title, than to what he en|joys by a durable or certain title; and of cour&s;e will be willing to ri&s;k more for the &s;ake of the one, than for the &s;ake of the other. This remark is not le&s;s applicable to a political privilege, or honor, or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">u&s;t, than to any article of ordinary property. The in|ference from it is, that a man acting in the capacity of chief magi&s;trate, under a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s, that in a very &s;hort time he <HI>mu&s;t</HI> lay down his office, will be apt to feel him&s;elf too little intere&s;ted in it, to hazard any material cen&s;ure or perplexity, from the inde|pendent exertion of his powers, or from encountering the ill-humors, however tran&s;ient, which may happen to prevail either in a con&s;iderable part of the &s;ociety it&s;elf, or even in a predominant faction in the legi&s;|lative body. If the ca&s;e &s;hould only be, that he <HI>might</HI> lay it down, unle&s;s continued by a new choice; and if he &s;hould be de&s;irous of being continued, his
<PB N="251" REF="021127_0488_0FB24E8164DA3440">
wi&s;hes con&s;piring with his fears would tend &s;till more powerfully to corrupt his integrity, or deba&s;e his for|titude. In either ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e feeblene&s;s and irre&s;olution mu&s;t be the characteri&s;tics of the &s;tation.</P>
<P>There are &s;ome, who would be inclined to regard the &s;ervi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e pliancy of the executive to a prevailing current, either in the community, or in the legi&s;lature as its be&s;t recommendation. But &s;uch men entertain very crude notions, as well of the purpo&s;es for which government was in&s;tituted, as of the true means by which the public happine&s;s may be promoted. The republican principle demands, that the deliberate &s;en&s;e of the community &s;hould govern the conduct of tho&s;e to whom they intru&s;t the management of their affairs; but it does not require an unqualified com|plai&s;ance to ev<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ry &s;udden bree&s;e of pa&s;&s;ion, or to every tran&s;ient impul&s;e which the people may <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">eive from the arts of men, who flatter their prejudices to betray their intere&s;ts. It is a ju&s;t ob&s;ervation, that the people commonly <HI>intend</HI> the PUBLIC GOOD. This often applies to their very errors. But their good &s;en&s;e would de&s;pi&s;e the adulator, who &s;hould pretend that they always <HI>rea&s;on right</HI> about the <HI>means</HI> of promoting it. They know from experience, that they &s;ometimes err; and the wonder is, that they &s;o &s;eldom err as they do; be&s;et as they continually are by the wiles of para&s;ites and &s;ycophants by the &s;nares of the am|bitious, the avariciou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, the de&s;perate; by the arti|fices of men, who po&s;&s;e&s;s their confidence m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">re than they de&s;erve it, and of tho&s;e who &s;eek to po&s;&s;e&s;s, ra|ther than to de&s;erve it. When occa&s;ions pre&s;ent them|&s;elves in which the intere&s;ts of the people are at va|ria<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">c with their inclinations, it is the duty of the per&s;ons whom they have appointed to be the guar|dians of tho&s;e intere&s;ts, to with&s;tand the temporary delu&s;ion, in order to give them time and opportunity for more cool and &s;edate reflection. In&s;tances might be cited, in which a conduct of this kind has &s;aved the people from very fatal con&s;equences of their own
<PB N="252" REF="021127_0489_0FB24E8280ED7510">
mi&s;takes, and has procured la&s;ting monuments of their gratitude to the men, who had had courage and magnanimity enough to &s;erve them at the peril of their di&s;plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>But however inclined we might be to in&s;i&s;t upon an unbounded complai&s;ance in the executive to the in|clinations of the people, we can with no propriety contend for a like complai&s;ance to the humors of the legi&s;lature. The atter may &s;ometimes &s;tand in op|po&s;ition to the former; and at other times the people may be intirely neutral. In either &s;uppo&s;ition, it is certainly de&s;ireable that the executive &s;hould be in a &s;ituation to dare to act his own opinion with vigour and deci&s;ion.</P>
<P>The &s;ame rule which teaches the propriety of a partition between the various branches of power, teaches likewi&s;e that this partition ought to be &s;o contrived as to rend<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r the one independent of the other. To what purpo&s;e &s;eparate the executive or the judiciary from the leg&s;liative, if both the exe|cutive and the judiciary are &s;o con&s;tituted as to be at the ab&s;olute devotion of the legi&s;lative? Such a &s;epa|ration mu&s;t be merely nominal, and incapable of pro|ducing the ends for which it was e&s;tabli&s;hed. It is one thing to be &s;ubordinate to the laws, and another to be dependent on the leg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;lative body. The fir&s;t comports with, the la&s;t violates, the fundamental principles of good government; and whatever may be the forms of the con&s;titution, unites all power in the &s;ame hands. The tendency of the legi&s;lative authority to ab&s;orb every other, has been fully di&s;|played and illu&s;trated by examples in &s;ome preceding numbers. In governments purely republican, this tendency is almo&s;t irre&s;i&s;table. The repre&s;entatives of the people, in a popular a&s;&s;embly, &s;eem &s;ometimes to fancy that they are the pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ple them&s;elves, and betray &s;trong &s;ympton of impatience and di&s;gu&s;t at the lea&s;t &s;ign of oppo&s;ition from any other quarter, as if the exerci&s;e of its rights by either the execu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">iv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> or

judiciary were a breach of their privilege and an out|rage to their dignity. They often appear di&s;po&s;ed to exert an imperious controul over the other depart|ments, and as they commonly have the people on their &s;ide, they always act with &s;uch momentum, as to make it very difficult for the other members of the go|vernment to maintain the balance of the con&s;titution.</P>
<P>It may perhaps be a&s;ked, how the &s;hortne&s;s of the duration in office can affect the independence of the executive on the legi&s;lative, unle&s;s the one were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the power of appointing or di&s;placing the other? One an&s;wer to this inquiry may be drawn from the principle already remarked, that is, from the &s;lender intere&s;t a man is apt to take in a &s;hort lived advantage, and the little inducement it affords him to expo&s;e him&s;elf on account of it to any con&s;i|derable inconvenience or hazard. Another an&s;wer, perhaps more obvious, though not more conclu&s;ive, will re&s;ult from the con&s;ideration of the influence of the legi&s;lative body over the people, which might be employed to prevent the re-election of a man, who by an upright re&s;i&s;tance to any &s;ini&s;ter project of that body, &s;hould have made him&s;elf obnoxious to its re&s;entment.</P>
<P>It may be a&s;ked al&s;o whether a duration of four years would an&s;wer the end propo&s;ed, and if it would not, whether a le&s;s period which would at lea&s;t be recommended by greater &s;ecurity again&s;t ambitious de&s;igns, would not for that rea&s;on be preferable to a longer period, which was at the &s;ame time too &s;hort for the purpo&s;e of in&s;piring the de&s;ired firmne&s;s and independence of the magi&s;trate?</P>
<P>It cannot be affirmed, that a duration of four years or any other limited duration would completely an|&s;wer the end propo&s;ed; but it would contribute towards it in a degree which would have a material influence upon the &s;pirit and character of the govern|ment. Between the commencement and termination of &s;uch a period there would always be a con&s;iderable
<PB N="254" REF="021127_0491_0FB247A12EDD0E18">
interval, in which the pro&s;pect of annihilation would be &s;ufficiently remote not to have an improper effect upon the conduct of a man endued with a tolerable portion of fortitude; and in which he might rea&s;on|ably promi&s;e him&s;elf, that there would be time enough before it arrived, to make the community &s;en&s;ible of the propriety of the mea&s;ures he might incline to pur&s;ue. Though it be probable, that as he approached the moment when the public were by a new election to &s;ignify their &s;en&s;e of his conduct, his confidence, and with it, his firmne&s;s would decline; yet both the one and the other would derive &s;upport from the opportunities, which his previous continuance in the &s;tation had afforded him of e&s;tabli&s;hing him&s;elf in the e&s;teem and good will of his con&s;tituents. He might then hazard with &s;afety, in proportion to the proofs he had given of his wi&s;dom and integrity, and to the title he had acquired to the re&s;pect and attachment of his fellow citizens. As on the one hand, a duration of four years will contribute to the firmne&s;s of the executive in a &s;ufficient degree to render it a very va|luable ingredient in the compo&s;ition; &s;o on the other it is not long enough to ju&s;tify any alarm for the public liberty.

<HEAD>NUMBER LXXII. The &s;ame View continued in Regard to the Re-eligibility of the Pre&s;ident.</HEAD>
<P>THE ADMINISTRATION of government, in its large&s;t &s;en&s;e, comprehends all the operations of the body politic, whether legi&s;lative, executive or judiciary, but in its mo&s;t u&s;ual and perhaps in its mo&s;t preci&s;e &s;ignification, it is limited to executive details, and falls peculiarly within the province of the executive department. The actual conduct of foreign negotiations, the preparatory plans of finance, the application and di&s;bur&s;ement of the public monies, in conformity to the general appropriations of the legi&s;lature, the arrangement of the army and navy, the direction of the operations of war; the&s;e and other matters of a like nature con&s;titute what &s;eems to be mo&s;t properly under&s;tood by the admini&s;tration of government. The per&s;ons therefore, to who&s;e im|mediate management the&s;e different matters are com|mitted, ought to be con&s;idered as the a&s;&s;i&s;tants or deputies of the chief magi&s;trate; and, on this ac|count, they ought to derive their offices from his ap|pointment, at lea&s;t from his nomination, and ought to be &s;ubject to his &s;uperintendence. This view of the &s;ubject will at once &s;ugge&s;t to us the intimate con|nection
<PB N="156" REF="021127_0493_0FB24799F5253598">
between the duration of the executive magi&s;|trate in office, and the &s;tability of the &s;y&s;tem of ad|mini&s;tration. To rever&s;e and undo what has been done by a predece&s;&s;or is very often con&s;idered by a &s;ucce&s;&s;or, as the be&s;t proof he can give of his own capacity and de&s;ert; and, in addition to this pro|pen&s;ity, where the alteration has been the re&s;ult of public choice, the per&s;on &s;ub&s;tituted is warranted in &s;uppo&s;ing, that the di&s;mi&s;&s;ion of his predece&s;&s;or has proceeded from a di&s;like to his mea&s;ures, and that the le&s;s he re&s;embles him the more he will recom|mend him&s;elf to the favour of his con&s;tituents. The&s;e con&s;iderations, and the influence of per&s;onal confi|dences and attachments, would be likely to induce every new pre&s;ident to promote a change of men to fill the &s;ubordinate &s;tations; and the&s;e cau&s;es together could not fail to occa&s;ion a di&s;graceful and ruinous mutability in the admini&s;tration of the government.</P>
<P>With a po&s;itive duration of con&s;iderable extent, I connect the circum&s;tance of re-elegibility. The fir&s;t is nece&s;&s;ary to give the officer him&s;elf the incli|nation and the re&s;olution to act his part well, and to the community time and lei&s;ure to ob&s;erve the ten|dency of his mea&s;ures, and thence to form an expe|rimental e&s;timate of their merits. The la&s;t is ne|ce&s;&s;ary to enable the people, when they &s;ee rea&s;on to approve of his conduct, to continue him in the &s;tation, in order to prolong the utility of his talents and vir|tues, and to &s;ecure to the government, the advantage of permanency in a wi&s;e &s;y&s;tem of admini&s;tration.</P>
<P>Nothing appears more plau&s;ible at fir&s;t &s;ight, nor more ill founded upon clo&s;e in&s;pection, than a &s;cheme which in relation to the pre&s;ent point has had &s;ome re&s;pectable advocates &mdash; I mean that of continuing the chief magi&s;trate in office for a certain time, and then excluding him from it, either for a limited period or for ever after. This exclu&s;ion whether temporary or perpetual would have nearly the &s;ame effects&punc; and
<PB N="257" REF="021127_0494_0FB2479B67BC4D60">
the&s;e effects would be for the mo&s;t part rather perni|cious than &s;alutary.</P>
<P>One ill effect of the exclu&s;ion would be a dimi|nution of the inducements to good behaviour. There are few men who would not feel much le&s;s zeal in the di&s;charge of a duty, when they were con&s;cious that the advantage of the &s;tation, with which it was con|nected, mu&s;t be relinqui&s;hed at a determinate period, then when they were permitted to entertain a hope of <HI>obtaining</HI> by <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eriting</HI> a continuance of them. This po&s;ition will not be di&s;puted, &s;o long as it is admit|ted that the de&s;ire of reward is one of the &s;tronge&s;t incentives of human conduct, or that the be&s;t &s;ecu|rity for the fidelity of mankind is to make their in|tere&s;t coincide with their duty. Even the love of fame, the ruling pa&s;&s;ion of the noble&s;t minds, which would prompt a man to plan and undertake exten&s;ive and arduous enterpri&s;es for the public benefit, requiring con&s;iderable time to mature and perfect them, if he could flatter him&s;elf with the pro&s;pect of being allowed to fini&s;h what he had begun, would on the contrary deter him from the undertaking, when he fore&s;aw that he mu&s;t quit the &s;cene, before he could accompli&s;h the work, and mu&s;t commit that, together with his own reputation, to hands which might be unequal or unfriendly to the ta&s;k. The mo&s;t to be expected from the generality of men, in &s;uch a &s;itu|ation, is the negative merit of not doing harm in|&s;tead of the po&s;itive merit of doing good.</P>
<P>Another ill effect of the exclu&s;ion would be the temptation to &s;ordid views, to peculation, and in &s;ome in&s;tances, to u&s;urpation. An avaricious man, who might happen to fill the office, looking forward to a time when he mu&s;t at all events yield up the advantages he enjoyed, would feel a propen&s;ity, not ea&s;y to be re&s;i&s;ted by &s;uch a man, to make the be&s;t u&s;e of his opportunities, while they la&s;ted; and might not &s;cruple to have recour&s;e to the mo&s;t corrupt expedients to make the harve&s;t as abundant

<P>An ambitious man too, finding him&s;elf &s;eated on the &s;ummit of his country's honors, looking forward to the time at which he mu&s;t de&s;cend from the exalted eminence forever, and reflecting that no exertion of merit on his part could &s;ave him from the unwelcome rever&s;e, would be much more violently tempted to embrace a favourable conjuncture for attempting the prolongation of his power, at every per&s;onal hazard, than if he had the probability of an&s;wering the &s;ame end by doing his duty.</P>

<P>A third ill effect of the exclu&s;ion would be the depriving the community of the advantage of the experience gained by the chief magi&s;trate in the ex|erci&s;e of his office. That experience is the parent of wi&s;dom is an adage, the truth of which is recognized by the wi&s;e&s;t as well as the &s;imple&s;t of mankind.

nation? Can it be wi&s;e to put this de&s;irable and e&s;&s;ential quality under the ban of the con&s;titution; and to declare that the moment it is acquired, its po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or &s;hall be compelled to abandon the &s;tation in which it was acquired, and to which it is adapted? This neverthele&s;s is the preci&s;e import of all tho&s;e regulations which exclude men from &s;erving their country, by the choice of their fellow citizens, after they have, by a cour&s;e of &s;ervice fitted them|&s;elves for doing it with a greater degree of utility.</P>
<P>A fourth ill effect of the exclu&s;ion would be the bani&s;hing men from &s;tations, in which in certain emergencies of the &s;tate then pre&s;ence might be of the greate&s;t moment to the public intere&s;t or &s;afety. There is no nation which has not at one period or another experienced an ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of the &s;er|vices of particular men, in particular &s;ituations, per|haps it would not be too &s;trong to &s;ay, to the pre&s;er|vation of its p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">litical exi&s;tence.

Without &s;uppo&s;ing the per&s;onal e&s;&s;entiality of the man, it is evident that a change of the chief magi&s;trate, at the breaking out of a war, or any &s;imilar cri&s;is, for another even of equal merit, would at all times be detrimental to the community; ina&s;much as it would &s;ub&s;titute inexperience to ex|perience, and would tend to unhinge and let afloat the already &s;ettled train of the admini&s;tration.</P>
<P>A fifth ill effect of the exclu&s;ion would be, that it would operate as a con&s;titutional interdiction of &s;ta|bility in the admini&s;tration. By <HI>nece&s;&s;itating</HI> a change of men, in the fir&s;t office in the nation, it would ne|ce&s;&s;itate a mutability of mea&s;ures. It is not gene|rally to be expected, that men will vary; and mea|&s;ures remain uniform. The contrary is the u&s;ual cour&s;e of things. And we need not be apprehen&s;ive that there will be too much &s;tability, while there is

even the option of changing; nor need we de&s;ire to prohibit the people from continuing their confi|dence, where they think it may be &s;afely placed, and where by con&s;tancy on their part, they may ob|viate the fatal inconveniences of fluctuating councils and a variable policy.</P>
<P>The&s;e are &s;ome of the di&s;advantages, which would flow from the principle of exclu&s;ion. They apply mo&s;t forcibly to the &s;cheme of a perpetual exclu&s;ion; but when we con&s;ider that even a partial one would always render the re-admi&s;&s;ion of the per&s;on a remote and precarious object, the ob&s;ervations which have been made will apply nearly as fully to one ca&s;e as to the other.</P>
<P>What are the advantages promi&s;ed to counter-ballance the&s;e di&s;advantages? They are repre&s;ented to be&mdash;1&s;t. Greater independence in the magi&s;trate: 2d. Greater &s;ecurity to the people. Unle&s;s the ex|clu&s;ion be perpetual, there will be no pretence to infer the fir&s;t advantage. But even in that ca&s;e, may he have no object beyond his pre&s;ent &s;tation to which he may &s;acrifice his independence? May he have no connections, no friends, for whom he may &s;acrifice it? May he not be le&s;s willing, by a firm conduct, to make per&s;onal enemies, when <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">acts under the im|pre&s;&s;ion, that a time is fa&s;t approaching, on the arrival of which he not only MAY, but MUST be expo&s;ed to their re&s;entments, upon an equal, perhaps upon an inferior footing? It is not an ea&s;y point to determine whether his independence would be mo&s;t promoted or impaired by &s;uch an arrangement.</P>
<P>As to the &s;econd &s;uppo&s;ed advantage, there is &s;till greater rea&s;on to entertain doubts concerning it, e&s;pecially if the exclu&s;ion were to be perpetual. In this ca&s;e, as already intimated, a man of irregular ambition, of whom alone there could be rea&s;on in any ca&s;e to entertain apprehen&s;ions, would with infinite reluctance yield to the nece&s;&s;ity of taking his leave for ever of a po&s;t, in which his pa&s;&s;ion for power and

pre-eminence had acquired the force of habit. And if he had been fortunate or adroit enough to conciliate the good will of the people, he might induce them to con&s;ider as a very odious and unju&s;tifiable re&s;traint upon them&s;elves, a provi&s;ion which was calculated to debar them of the right of giving a fre&s;h proof of their attachment to a favorite. There may be con|ceived circum&s;tances in which this di&s;gu&s;t of the people, &s;econding the thwarted ambition of &s;uch a favorite, might occa&s;ion greater danger to liberty, than could ever rea&s;onably be dreaded from the po&s;&s;i|bility of a perpetuation in office, by the voluntary &s;uffrages of the community, exerci&s;ing a con&s;titu|tional privilege.</P>
<P>There is an exce&s;s of refinement in the idea of di&s;|abling the people to continue in office men, who had entitled them&s;elves, in their opinion, to approbation and confidence; the advantages of which are at be&s;t &s;peculative and equivoc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l, and are overbalanced by di&s;advantages far more certain and deci&s;ive.</P>

<HEAD>NUMBER LXXIII. The &s;ame View continued, in Relation to the Provi&s;ion concerning Support, and the Power of the Negative.</HEAD>
<P>THE third ingredient towards con&s;tituting the vigour of the executive authority is an adequate provi&s;ion for its &s;upport. It is evident that without proper attention to this article, the &s;eparation of the executive from the legi&s;lative department would be merely nominal and nugatory. The legi&s;lature, with a di&s;cretionary power over the &s;alary and emo|luments of the chief magi&s;trate, could render him as ob&s;equious to their will, as they might think pro|per to make him. They might in mo&s;t ca&s;es either
<PB N="262" REF="021127_0499_0FB249BCEBD511C0">
reduce him by famine, or tempt him by large&s;&s;es, to &s;urrender at di&s;cretion his judgment to their in|clinations. The&s;e expre&s;&s;ions taken in all the latitude of the terms would no doubt convey more than is intended. There are men who could neither be di&s;tre&s;&s;ed nor won into a &s;acrifice of their duty; but this &s;tern virtue is the growth of few &s;oils: And in the main it will be found, that a power over a man's &s;upport is a power over his will. If it were nece&s;&s;ary to confirm &s;o plain a truth by facts, examples would not be wanting, even in this country, of the intimi|dation or &s;eduction of the executive by the terrors, or allurements, of the pecuniary arrangements of the legi&s;lative body.</P>
<P>It is not ea&s;y therefore to commend too highly the judicious attention which has been paid to this &s;ub|ject in the propo&s;ed con&s;titution. It is there provided that
<Q>The pre&s;ident of the United States &s;hall at &s;tated times receive for his &s;ervice a compen&s;ation, <HI>which &s;hall neither be increa&s;ed nor dimini&s;hed, during the period for which he &s;hall have been elected,</HI> and he &s;hall <HI>not receive within that period any other emo|lument</HI> from the United States or any of them.</Q>
It is impo&s;&s;ible to imagine any provi&s;ion which would have been more eligible than this. The legi&s;lature on the appointment of a pre&s;ident is once for all to declare what &s;hall be the compen&s;ation for his &s;ervices during the time for which he &s;hall have been elected. This done, they will have no power to alter it either by increa&s;e or diminution, till a new period of &s;er|vice by a new election commences. They can neither weaken his fortitude by operating upon his nece&s;&s;ities; not corrupt his integrity, by appealing to his avarice. Neither the union nor any of its members will be at liberty to give, nor will he be at liberty to receive any other emolument, than that which may have been determined by the fir&s;t act. He can of cour&s;e have no pecuniary inducement to renounce or de&s;ert the inde|pendence intended for him by the con&s;titution.</P>
<P><PB N="263" REF="021127_0500_0FB249BFC17D64B8">The la&s;t of the requi&s;ites to energy which have been enumerated are competent powers. Let us pro|ceed to con&s;ider tho&s;e which are propo&s;ed to be ve&s;ted in the pre&s;ident of the United States.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t thing that offers it&s;elf to our ob&s;ervation, is the qualified negative of the pre&s;ident upon the acts or re&s;olutions of the two hou&s;es of the legi&s;lature; or in other words his power of returning all bills with objections; to have the effect of preventing their becoming laws, unle&s;s they &s;hould afterwards be ratified by two thirds of each of the component mem|bers of the legi&s;lative body.</P>
<P>The propen&s;ity of the legi&s;lative department to intrude upon the rights and to ab&s;orb the powers of the other departments, has been already more than once &s;ugge&s;ted; the in&s;ufficiency of a mere parchment delineation of the boundaries of each, has al&s;o been remarked upon; and the nece&s;&s;ity of furni&s;hing each with con&s;titutional arms for its own defence, has been inferred and proved. From the&s;e clear and indubitable principles re&s;ults the propriety of a ne|gative, either ab&s;olute or qualified, in the executive, upon the acts of the legi&s;lative branches. Without the one or the other, the former would be ab&s;olutely unable to defend him&s;elf again&s;t the depredations of the latter. He might gradually be &s;tripped of his authorities by &s;ucce&s;&s;ive re&s;olutions, or annihilated by a &s;ingle vote. And in the one mode or the other, the legi&s;lative and executive powers might &s;peedily come to be blended in the &s;ame hands. If even no propen&s;ity had ever di&s;covered it&s;elf in the legi&s;lative body, to invade the rights of the executive, the rules of ju&s;t rea&s;oning and theoretic propriety would of them&s;elves teach us, that the one ought not to be left at the mercy of the other, but ought to po&s;&s;e&s;s a con&s;titutional and effectual power of &s;elf defence.</P>
<P>But the power in que&s;tion has a further u&s;e. It not only &s;erves as a &s;hield to the executive, but it furni&s;hes an additional &s;ecurity again&s;t the enaction
<PB N="264" REF="021127_0501_0FB249C1F989B4B0">
of improper laws. It e&s;tabli&s;hes a &s;alutary check upon the legi&s;lative body calculated to guard the community again&s;t the effects of faction, precipi|tancy, or of any impul&s;e unfriendly to the public good, which may happen to influence a majority of that body.</P>
<P>The propriety of a negative, has upon &s;ome occa|&s;ions been combated by an ob&s;ervation, that it was not to be pre&s;umed a &s;ingle man would po&s;&s;e&s;s more virtue or wi&s;dom, than a number of men; and that unle&s;s this pre&s;umption &s;hould be entertained, it would be improper to give the executive magi&s;trate any &s;pecies of controul over the legi&s;lative body.</P>
<P>But this ob&s;ervation, when examined, will appear rather &s;pecious than &s;olid. The propriety of the thing does not turn upon the &s;uppo&s;ition of &s;uperior wi&s;dom or virtue in the executive; but upon the &s;uppo&s;ition that the legi&s;lative will not be infallible: That the love of power may &s;ometimes betray it into a di&s;po|&s;ition to encroach upon the rights of the other mem|bers of the government; that a &s;pirit of faction may &s;ometimes pervert its deliberations; that impre&s;&s;ions of the moment may &s;ometimes hurry it into mea&s;ures which it&s;elf, on maturer reflection, would condemn. The primary inducement to conferring the power in que&s;tion upon the executive, is to enable him to defend him&s;elf; the &s;econdary one is to encrea&s;e the chances in favour of the community again&s;t the pa&s;&s;ing of bad laws, through ha&s;te, inadvertence, or de&s;ign. The oftener a mea&s;ure is brought under examination, the greater the diver&s;ity in the &s;ituations of tho&s;e who are to examine it, the le&s;s mu&s;t be the danger of tho&s;e errors which flow from want of due deliberation, or of tho&s;e mi&s;teps which proceed from the contagion of &s;ome common pa&s;&s;ion or intere&s;t. It is far le&s;s pro|bable, that culpable views of any kind &s;hould infect all the parts of the government, at the &s;ame moment and in relation to the &s;ame object, than that they &s;hould by turns govern and mi&s;lead every one of them.</P>
<P><PB N="265" REF="021127_0502_0FB249C548066D98">It may perhaps be &s;aid, that the power of prevent|ing bad laws includes that of preventing good ones; and may be u&s;ed to the one purpo&s;e as well as to the other. But this objection will have little weight with tho&s;e who can properly e&s;timate the mi&s;chiefs of that incon&s;tancy and mutability in the laws which form the greate&s;t blemi&s;h in the character and genius of our governments. They will con&s;ider every in&s;titu|tion calculated to re&s;train the exce&s;s of law-making, and to keep things in the &s;ame &s;tate in which they may happen to be at any given period, as much more likely to do good than harm; becau&s;e it is favorable to greater &s;tability in the &s;y&s;tem of legi&s;lation. The injury which may po&s;&s;ibly be done by defeating a few good laws will be amply compen&s;ated by the ad|vantage of preventing a number of bad ones.</P>
<P>Nor is this all. The &s;uperior weight and influence of the legi&s;lative body in a free government, and the hazard to the executive in a trial of &s;trength with that body, afford a &s;atisfactory &s;ecurity, that the ne|gative would generally be employed with great cau|tion, and that there would oftener be room for a charge of timidity than of ra&s;hne&s;s, in the exerci&s;e of it. A king of Great Britain, with all his train of &s;ove|reign attributes, and with all the influence he draws from a thou&s;and &s;ources, would at this day he&s;itate to put a negative upon the joint re&s;olutions of the two hou&s;es of parliament. He would not fail to exert the utmo&s;t re&s;ources of that influence to &s;trangle a mea|&s;ure di&s;agreeable to him, in its progre&s;s to the throne, to avoid being reduced to the dilemma of permitting it to take effect, or of ri&s;king the di&s;plea&s;ure of the nation, by an oppo&s;ition to the &s;en&s;e of the legi&s;la|tive body. Nor is it probable that he would ulti|mately venture to exert his prerogative, but in a ca&s;e of manife&s;t propriety, or extreme nece&s;&s;ity. All well informed men in that kingdom will accede to the ju&s;tne&s;s of this remark. A very con&s;iderable

period has elap&s;ed &s;ince the negative of the crown has been exerci&s;ed.</P>
<P>If a magi&s;trate, &s;o powerful and &s;o well fortified as a Briti&s;h monarch, would have &s;cruples about the exerci&s;e of the power under con&s;ideration<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> how much greater caution may be rea&s;onably expected in a pre|&s;ident of the United States, cloathed for the &s;hort period of four years with the executive authority of a government wholly and purely republican?</P>
<P>It is evident that there would be greater danger of his not u&s;ing his power when nece&s;&s;ary, than of his u&s;ing it too often, or too much. An argument indeed again&s;t its expediency has been drawn from this very &s;ource. It has been repre&s;ented on this account as a power odious in appearance, u&s;ele&s;s in practice. But it will not follow, that becau&s;e it might be rarely exerci&s;ed, it would never be exerci&s;ed. In the ca&s;e for which it is chiefly de&s;igned, that of an imme|diate attack upon the con&s;titutional rights of the exe|cutive, or in a ca&s;e in which the public good was evidently and palpably &s;acrificed, a man of tolerable firmne&s;s would avail him&s;elf of his con&s;titutional means of defence, and would li&s;ten to the admoni|tions of duty and re&s;pon&s;ibility. In the former &s;up|po&s;ition, his fortitude would be &s;timulated by his immediate intere&s;t in the power of his office; in the latter by the probability of the &s;anction of his con&s;tituents; who though they would naturally incline to the legi&s;lative body in a doubtful ca&s;e, would hardly &s;uffer their partiality to delude them in a very plain ca&s;e. I &s;peak now with an eye to a magi&s;trate po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing only a common &s;hare of firmne&s;s. There are men, who under any circum&s;tances will have the courage to do their duty at every hazard.</P>
<P>But the convention have pur&s;ued a mean in this bu&s;ine&s;s; which will both facilitate the exerci&s;e of the power ve&s;ted in this re&s;pect in the executive magi&s;trate, and make its efficacy to depend on the &s;en&s;e of a con&s;iderable part of the legi&s;lative body.

In&s;tead of an ab&s;olute negative, it is propo&s;ed to give the executive the qualified negative already de|&s;cribed. This is a power, which would be much more readily exerci&s;ed than the other. A man who might be afraid to defeat a law by his &s;ingle VETO, might not &s;cruple to return it for re-con&s;ideration; &s;ubject to being finally rejected only in the event of more than one third of each hou&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> concurring in the &s;uffici|ency of his objections.

A direct and cate|gorical negative has &s;omething in the appearance of it more har&s;h, and more apt to irri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ate, than the mere &s;ugge&s;tion of argumentative objections to be approved or di&s;approved, by tho&s;e to whom they are addre&s;&s;ed. In proportion as it would be le&s;s apt to offend, it would be more apt to be exerci&s;ed; and for this very rea&s;on it may in practice be found more effectual. It is to be hoped that it will not often happen, that improper views will govern &s;o large a proportion as two-thirds of both branches of the legi&s;lature at the &s;ame time; and this too in defiance of the counterpoi&s;ing weight of the executive. It is at any rate far le&s;s probable, that this &s;hould be the ca&s;e, than that &s;uch views &s;hould taint the re&s;olu|tions and conduct of a bare majority.

As the &s;en&s;e of re&s;pon&s;ibility is always &s;tronge&s;t in proportion as it is undivided, it may be inferred that a &s;ingle man would be mo&s;t ready to attend to the force of tho&s;e motives, which might plead for a mitigation of the rigor of the law, and lea&s;t apt to yield to con&s;iderations, which were calculated to &s;helter a fit object of its vengeance. The reflection that the fate of a fellow creature depended on his <HI>&s;ole fiat,</HI> would naturally in&s;pire
<PB N="270" REF="021127_0507_0FB249D2F6DC8E40">
&s;crupulou&s;ne&s;s and caution: The dread of being accu|&s;ed of weakne&s;s or connivance would beget equal circum&s;pection, though of a different kind. On the other hand, as men generally derive confidence from their numbers, they might often encourage each other in an act of obduracy, and might be le&s;s &s;en&s;ible to the apprehen&s;ion of &s;u&s;picion or cen&s;ure for an inju|dicious or affected clemency. On the&s;e accounts, one man appears to be a more eligible di&s;pen&s;er of the mercy of the government than a body of men.</P>
<P>The expediency of ve&s;ting the power of pardoning in the pre&s;ident has&punc; if I mi&s;take not, been only conte&s;ted in relation to the crime of trea&s;on. This, it has been urged, ought to have depended upon the a&s;&s;ent of one or both of the branches of the legi&s;lative body. I &s;hall not deny that there are &s;trong rea&s;ons to be a&s;&s;igned for requiring in this particular the concurrence of that body, or of a part of it. As trea&s;on is a crime levelled at the immediate being of the &s;ociety, when the laws have once a&s;certained the guilt of the offender, there &s;eems a fitne&s;s in refering the expediency of an act of mercy towards him to the judgment of the legi&s;lature. And this ought the rather to be the ca&s;e, as the &s;uppo&s;ition of the connivance of the chief magi&s;trate ought not to be entirely excluded. But there are al&s;o &s;trong ob|jections to &s;uch a plan. It is not to be doubted that a &s;ingle man of prudence and good &s;en&s;e, is better fitted, in delicate conjunctures, to balance the mo|tives which may plead for and again&s;t the remi&s;&s;ion of the puni&s;hment, than any numerous body what|ever. It de&s;erves particular attention, that trea&s;on will often be connected with &s;editions, which em|brace a large proportion of the community; as lately happened in Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts. In every &s;uch ca&s;e, we might expect to &s;ee the repre&s;entation of the people tainted with the &s;ame &s;pirit which had given birth to the offence. And when parties were pretty equally matched, the &s;ecret &s;ympathy of the friends and
<PB N="271" REF="021127_0508_0FB249D3ED752D30">
favorers of the condemned, availing it&s;elf of the good nature and weakne&s;s of others, might fre|quently be&s;tow impunity where the terror of an example was nece&s;&s;ary. On the other hand, when the &s;edition had proceeded from cau&s;es which had inflamed the re&s;entments of the major party, they might, often be found ob&s;tinate and inexorable, when policy demanded a conduct of forbearance and cle|mency. But the principal argument for repo&s;ing the power of pardoning in this ca&s;e in the chief magi&s;trate is this; in &s;ea&s;ons of in&s;urrection or rebel|lion, there are often critical moments, when a well-timed offer of pardon to the in&s;urgents or rebels may re&s;tore the tranquility of the commonwealth; and which, if &s;uffered to pa&s;s unimproved, it may never be po&s;&s;ible afterwards to recall. The dilatory pro|ce&s;s of convening the legi&s;lature, or one of its branches, for the purpo&s;e of obtaining its &s;anction to the mea&s;ure, would frequently be the occa&s;ion of letting &s;lip the golden opportunity. The lo&s;s of a week, a day, an hour, may &s;ometimes be fatal. If it &s;hould be ob&s;erved that a di&s;cretionary power with a view to &s;uch contingencies might be occa&s;ionally confered upon the pre&s;ident; it may be an&s;wered in the fir&s;t place, that it is que&s;tionable whether, in a limited con&s;titution, that power could be delega|ted by law; and in the &s;econd place, that it would generally be impolitic before-hand to take any &s;tep which might hold out the pro&s;pect of impunity. A proceeding of this kind, out of the u&s;ual cour&s;e, would be likely to be con&s;trued into an argument of timi|dity or of weakne&s;s, and would have a tendency to embolden guilt.</P>

<HEAD>NUMBER LXXV. The &s;ame View continued in Relation to the Power of making Treaties.</HEAD>
<P>THE pre&s;ident is to have power
<Q>by and with the advice and con&s;ent of the &s;enate, to make treaties provided two-thirds of the &s;enators pre&s;ent concur.</Q>
Though this provi&s;ion has been a&s;&s;ailed on different grounds, with no &s;mall degree of vehe|mence, I &s;cruple not to declare my firm per&s;ua&s;ion, that it is one of the be&s;t dige&s;ted and mo&s;t unexcep|tionable parts of the plan. One ground of objection is, the trite topic of the intermixture of powers; &s;ome contending that the pre&s;ident ought alone to po&s;&s;e&s;s the power of making treaties; and others, that it ought to have been exclu&s;ively depo&s;ited in the &s;enate. Another &s;ource of objection is derived from the &s;mall number of per&s;ons by whom a treaty may be made: Of tho&s;e who e&s;pou&s;e this objection, a part are of opinion that the hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives ought to have been a&s;&s;ociated in the bu&s;ine&s;s, while another part &s;eem to think that nothing more was nece&s;&s;ary than to have &s;ub&s;tituted two-thirds of <HI>all</HI> the members of the &s;enate to two-thirds of the members <HI>pre&s;ent.</HI> As I flatter my&s;elf the ob&s;ervations made in a preceding number, upon this part of the plan, mu&s;t have &s;ufficed to place it to a di&s;cerning eye in a very favourable light, I &s;hall here content my&s;elf with offering only &s;ome &s;upplementary remarks, principally with a view to the objections which have been ju&s;t &s;tated.</P>
<P>With regard to the intermixture of powers, I &s;hall rely upon the explanations already given, in other places, of the true &s;en&s;e of the rule, upon which that objection is founded; and &s;hall take it for granted, as an inference from them, that the union of the executive with the &s;enate, in the article of treaties, is no infringment of that rule. I venture to add that
<PB N="273" REF="021127_0510_0FB249DCA0BF0E80">
the particular nature of the power of making treaties indicates a peculiar propriety in that union. Though &s;everal writers on the &s;ubject of government place that power in the cla&s;s of executive authorities, yet this is evidently an arbitrary di&s;po&s;ition: For if we attend carefully to its operation, it will be found to partake more of the legi&s;lative than of the executive cha|racter, though it does not &s;eem &s;trictly to fall within the definition of either of them. The e&s;&s;ence of the legi&s;lative authority is to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nact laws, or in other words to pre&s;cribe rules for the regulation of the &s;ociety. While the execution of the laws and the employment of the common &s;trength, either for this purpo&s;e or for the common defence, &s;eem to compri&s;e all the functions of the executive magi&s;trate. The power of making treaties is plainly neither the one nor the other. It relates neither to the execution of the &s;ub&s;i&s;ting laws, nor to the enaction of new ones, and &s;till le&s;s to an exertion of the common &s;trength. Its objects are CONTRACTS with foreign nations, which have the force of law, but derive it from the obligations of good faith. They are not rules pre|&s;cribed by the &s;overeign to the &s;ubject, but agree|ments between &s;overeign and &s;overeign. The power in que&s;tion &s;eems therefore to form a di&s;tinct depart|ment, and to belong properly neither to the legi&s;la|tive nor to the executive. The qualities el&s;ewhere detailed, as indi&s;pen&s;able in the management of foreign negociations, point out the executive as the mo&s;t fit agent in tho&s;e tran&s;actions; while the va&s;t importance of the tru&s;t, and the operation of treaties as laws, plead &s;trongly for the participation of the whole or a part of the legi&s;lative body in the office of making them.</P>
<P>However proper or &s;afe it may be in governments where the executive magi&s;trate is an hereditary monarch, to commit to him the entire power of making treaties, it would be utterly un&s;afe and im|proper to entru&s;t that power to an elective magi&s;trate
<PB N="274" REF="021127_0511_0FB249E188104CF0">
of four years duration. It has been remarked upon another occa&s;ion, and the remark is unque&s;tionably ju&s;t, that an hereditary monarch, though often the oppre&s;&s;or of his people, has per&s;onally too much at &s;take in the government to be in any material dan|ger of being corrupted by foreign powers. But that a man rai&s;ed from the &s;tation of a private citizen to the rank of chief magi&s;trate, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of but a mode|rate or &s;lender fortune, and looking forward to a period not very remote, when he may probably be obliged to return to the &s;tation from which he was taken, might &s;ometimes be under temptations to &s;acrifice his duty to his intere&s;t, which it would require &s;uperlative virtue to with&s;tand. An avari|cious man might be tempted to betray the intere&s;ts of the &s;tate to the acqui&s;ition of wealth. An ambitious man might make his own aggrandizement, by the aid of a foreign power, the price of his treachery to his con&s;tituents. The hi&s;tory of human conduct does not warrant that exalted opinion of human vir|tue which would make it wi&s;e in a nation to commit intere&s;ts of &s;o delicate and momentous a kind as tho&s;e which concern its intercour&s;e with the re&s;t of the world to the &s;ole di&s;po&s;al of a magi&s;trate, created and circum&s;tanced, as would be a pre&s;ident of the United States.</P>
<P>To have entru&s;ted the power of making treaties to the &s;enate alone, would have been to relinqui&s;h the benefits of the con&s;titutional agency of the pre&s;ident, in the conduct of foreign negotiations. It is true, that the &s;enate would in that ca&s;e have the option of employing him in this capacity; but they would al&s;o have the option of letting it alone; and pique or cabal might induce the latter rather than the former. Be&s;ides this, the mini&s;terial &s;ervant of the &s;enate could not be expected to enjoy the confidence and re&s;pect of foreign powers in the &s;ame degree with the con&s;titutional repre&s;entative of the nation; and of cour&s;e would not be able to act with an equal degree
<PB N="275" REF="021127_0512_0FB249E2F48CD1E0">
of weight or efficacy. While the union would from this cau&s;e lo&s;e a con&s;iderable advantage in the ma|nagement of its external concerns, the people would lo&s;e the additional &s;ecurity, which would re&s;ult from the co-operation of the executive. Though it would be imprudent to confide in him &s;olely &s;o important a tru&s;t; yet it cannot be doubted, that his participation in it would materially add to the &s;afety of the &s;ociety. It mu&s;t indeed be clear to a demon&s;tration, that the joint po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the power in que&s;tion by the pre&s;i|dent and &s;enate would afford a greater pro&s;pect of &s;ecurity, than the &s;eparate po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it by either of them. And whoever has maturely weighed the circum&s;tances, which mu&s;t concur in the appointment of a pre&s;ident will be &s;atisfied, that the office will always bid fair to be filled by men of &s;uch characters as to render their concurrence in the formation of treaties peculiarly de&s;irable, as well on the &s;core of wi&s;dom as on that of integrity.</P>
<P>The remarks made in a former number, which has been alluded to in another part of this paper, will apply with conclu&s;ive force again&s;t the admi&s;&s;ion of the hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives to a &s;hare in the forma|tion of treaties. The fluctuating, and taking its future increa&s;e into the account, the multitudinous compo&s;ition of that body, forbid us to expect in it tho&s;e qualities which are e&s;&s;ential to the proper exe|cution of &s;uch a tru&s;t. Accurate and comprehen&s;ive knowledge of foreign politics; a &s;teady and &s;y&s;te|matic adherence to the &s;ame views; a nice and uni|form &s;en&s;ibility to national character, deci&s;ion, <HI>&s;ecrecy</HI> and di&s;patch; are incompatible with the genius of a body &s;o variable and &s;o numerous. The very com|plication of the bu&s;ine&s;s by introducing a nece&s;&s;ity of the concurrence of &s;o many different bodies, would of it&s;elf afford a &s;olid objection. The greater frequency of the calls upon the hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives, and the greater length of time which it would often be nece&s;|&s;ary to keep them together when convened, to obtain
<PB N="276" REF="021127_0513_0FB249E467B6DEC0">
their &s;anction in the progre&s;&s;ive &s;tages of a treaty, would be &s;ource of &s;o great inconvenience and expence as alone ought to condemn the project.</P>
<P>The only objection which remains to be canva&s;&s;ed is that which would &s;ub&s;titute the proportion of two thirds of all the members compo&s;ing the &s;enatorial body, to that of two thirds of the members <HI>pre&s;ent.</HI> It has been &s;hewn under the &s;econd head of our enqui|ries that all provi&s;ions which require more than the majority of any body to its re&s;olutions have a direct tendency to embarra&s;s the operations of the govern|ment and an indirect one to &s;ubject the &s;en&s;e of the majority to that of the minority. This con&s;ideration &s;eems &s;ufficient to determine our opinion, that the convention have gone as far in the endeavour to &s;ecure the advantage of numbers in the formation of treaties as could have been reconciled either with the activity of the public councils or with a rea&s;onable regard to the major &s;en&s;e of the community. If two thirds of the whole number of members had been required, it would in many ca&s;es from the non-atten|dence of a part amount in practice to a nece&s;&s;ity of unanimity. And the hi&s;tory of every political e&s;ta|bli&s;hment in which this principle has prevailed is a hi&s;tory of impotence, perplexity and di&s;order. Proofs of this po&s;ition might be adduced from the examples of the Roman tribune&s;hip, the Poli&s;h diet and the &s;tates general of the Netherlands; did not an example at home render foreign precedents unnece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>To require a fixed proportion of the whole body would not in all probability contribute to the advan|tages of a numerous agency, better than merely to require a proportion of the attending members. The former by increa&s;ing the difficulty of re&s;olutions di&s;|agreeable to the minority dimini&s;hes the motives to punctual attendance. The latter by making the capacity of the body to depend on a <HI>proportion</HI> which may be varied by the ab&s;ence or pre&s;ence of a &s;ingle member, has the contrary effect. And as, by pro|moting
<PB N="277" REF="021127_0514_0FB249ED91097B10">
punctuality, it tends to keep the body com|plete, there is great likelihood that its re&s;olutions would generally be dictated by as great a number in this ca&s;e as in the other; while there would be much fewer occa&s;ions of delay. It ought not to be for|gotten that under the exi&s;ting confederation two members <HI>may</HI> and u&s;ually <HI>do</HI> repre&s;ent a &s;tate; whence it happens that congre&s;s, who now are &s;olely inve&s;ted with <HI>all the powers</HI> of the union, rarely con&s;i&s;ts of a greater number of per&s;ons than would compo&s;e the intended &s;enate. If we add to this, that as the members vote by &s;tates, and that where there is only a &s;ingle member pre&s;ent from a &s;tate, his vote is lo&s;t, it will ju&s;tify a &s;uppo&s;ition that the active voices in the &s;enate, whe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e the members are to vote individu|ally, would rarely fall &s;hort in number of the active voices in the exi&s;ting congre&s;s. When in addition to the&s;e con&s;iderations we take into view the co-ope|ration of the pre&s;ident, we &s;hall not he&s;itate to infer that the people of America would have greater &s;ecu|rity again&s;t an improper u&s;e of the power of making treaties, under the new con&s;titution, than they now enjoy under the confederation. And when we pro|ceed &s;till one &s;tep further, and look forward to the probable augmentation of the &s;enate, by the erection of new &s;tates we &s;hall not only perceive ample ground of confidence in the &s;ufficiency of the numbers, to who&s;e agency that power will be entru&s;ted; but we &s;hall probably be led to conclude that a body more numerous than the &s;enate would be likely to become, would be very little fit for the proper di&s;charge of the tru&s;t.</P>

<HEAD>NUMBER LXXVI. The &s;ame View continued, in Relation to the Appointment of the Officers of the Govern|ment.</HEAD>
<P>THE pre&s;ident is
<Q>to <HI>nominate</HI> and by and with the advice and con&s;ent of the &s;enate to appoint amba&s;&s;adors, other public mini&s;ters and con&s;uls, judges of the &s;upreme court, and all other officers of the United States, who&s;e appointments are not otherwi&s;e provided for in the con&s;titution. But the congre&s;s may by law ve&s;t the appointment of &s;uch inferior officers as they think proper in the pre&s;ident alone, or in the courts of law, or in the heads of departments. The pre&s;ident &s;hall have power to fill up <HI>all vacancies</HI> which may happen <HI>during the rece&s;s of the &s;enate,</HI> by granting commi&s;|&s;ions which &s;hall <HI>expire</HI> at the end of their next &s;e&s;&s;ion.</Q></P>
<P>It has been ob&s;erved in a former paper that
<Q>the true te&s;t of a good government is its aptitude and tendency to produce a good admini&s;tration.</Q>
If the ju&s;tne&s;s of this ob&s;ervation be admitted, the mode of appointing the officers of the United States contained in the foregoing clau&s;es, mu&s;t, when examined, be allowed to be entitled to particular commendation. It is not ea&s;y to conceive a plan better calculated than this, to promote a judicious choice of men for filling the offices of the union; and it will not need proof that on this point mu&s;t e&s;&s;entially depend the character of its admini&s;tration.</P>
<P>It will be agreed on all hands, that the power of appointment in ordinary ca&s;es can be properly mo|dified only in one of three ways. It ought either to be ve&s;ted in a &s;ingle man&mdash;or in a <HI>&s;elect</HI> a&s;&s;embly of a moderate number&mdash;or in a &s;ingle man with the
<PB N="279" REF="021127_0516_0FB249F267A7EE88">
concurrence of &s;uch an a&s;&s;embly. The exerci&s;e of it by the people at large, will be readily admitted to be impracticable; as, waving every other con&s;ideration it would leave them little time to do any thing el&s;e. When therefore mention is made in the &s;ub&s;equent rea&s;onings of an a&s;&s;embly or body of men, what is &s;aid mu&s;t be under&s;tood to relate to a &s;elect body or a&s;&s;embly of the de&s;cription already given. The people collectively from their number and from their di&s;per&s;ed &s;ituation cannot be regulated in their move|ments by that &s;y&s;tematic &s;pirit of cabal and intrigue, which will be urged as the chief objections to repo&s;ing the power in que&s;tion in a body of men.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who have them&s;elves reflected upon the &s;ubject, or who have attended to the ob&s;ervations made in other parts of the&s;e papers, in relation to the appointment of the pre&s;ident, will, I pre&s;ume, agree to the po&s;ition that there would always be great pro|bability of having the place &s;upplied by a man of abilities, at lea&s;t re&s;pectable. Premi&s;ing this, I pro|ceed to lay it down as a rule, that one man of di&s;|cernment is better fitted to anali&s;e and e&s;timate the peculiar qualities adapted to particular offices, than a body of men of equal, or perhaps even of &s;uperior di&s;cernment.</P>
<P>The &s;ole and undivided re&s;pon&s;ibility of one man will naturally beget a livelier &s;en&s;e of duty and a more exact regard to reputation. He will on this account feel him&s;elf under &s;tronger obligations, and more intere&s;ted to inve&s;tigate with care the qualities requi&s;ite to the &s;tations to be filled, and to prefer with impartiality the per&s;ons who may have the faire&s;t preten&s;ions to them. He will have <HI>fewer</HI> per&s;onal attachments to gratify than a body of men, who may each be &s;uppo&s;ed to have an equal number, and will be &s;o much the le&s;s liable to be mi&s;led by the &s;entiments of friend&s;hip and of affection. There is nothing &s;o apt to agitate the pa&s;&s;ions of mankind as per&s;onal con&s;iderations, whether they relate to
<PB N="280" REF="021127_0517_0FB249F387C6B130">
our&s;elves or to others, who are to be the objects of our choice or preference. Hence, in every exerci&s;e of the power of appointing to offices by an a&s;&s;embly of men, we mu&s;t expect to &s;ee a full di&s;play of all the private and party likings and di&s;likes, parti|alities and antipathies, attachments and animo&s;ities, which are felt by tho&s;e who compo&s;e the a&s;&s;embly. The choice which may at any time happen to be made under &s;uch circum&s;tances will of cour&s;e be the re&s;ult either of a victory gained by one party over the other, or of a compromi&s;e between the parties. In either ca&s;e, the intrin&s;ic merit of the candidate will be too often out of &s;ight. In the fir&s;t, the quali|fications be&s;t adapted to uniting the &s;uffrages of the party will be more con&s;idered than tho&s;e which fit the per&s;on for the &s;tation. In the la&s;t, the coalition will commonly turn upon &s;ome intere&s;ted equivalent,
<Q>Give us the man we wi&s;h for this office, and you &s;hall have the one you wi&s;h for that.</Q>
This will be the u&s;ual condition of the bargain. And it will rarely happen that the advancement of the public &s;ervice will be the primary object either of party victories or of party negotiations.</P>
<P>The truth of the principles here advanced &s;eems to have been felt by the mo&s;t intelligent of tho&s;e who have found fault with the provi&s;ion made in this re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">pect by the convention. They contend that the pre&s;ident ought &s;olely to have been authori&s;ed to make the appointments under the federal govern|ment. But it is ea&s;y to &s;hew that every advantage to be expected from &s;uch an arrangement would in &s;ub&s;tance be derived from the power of <HI>nomination,</HI> which is propo&s;ed to be conferred upon him; while &s;everal di&s;advantages which might attend the ab&s;o|lute power of appointment in the hands of that officer would be avoided. In the act of nomination, his judgment alone would be exerci&s;ed; and as it would be his &s;ole duty to point out the man, who with the approbation of the &s;enate &s;hould fill an office, his
<PB N="281" REF="021127_0518_0FB249F51390BE48">
re&s;pon&s;ibility would be as complete as if he were to make the final appointment. There can in this view be no difference between nominating and appointing. The &s;ame motives which would influ|ence a proper di&s;charge of his duty in one ca&s;e, would exi&s;t in the other. And as no man could be appointed, but upon his previous nomination, every man who might be appointed would be in fact his choice.</P>
<P>But his nomination may be overruled:&mdash;This it certainly may, yet it can only be to make place for another nomination by him&s;elf. The per&s;on ulti|mately appointed mu&s;t be the object of his preference though perhaps not in the fir&s;t degree. It is al&s;o not very probable that his nomination would often be overruled. The &s;enate could not be tempted by the preference they might feel to another to reject the one propo&s;ed; becau&s;e they could not a&s;&s;ure them&s;elves that the per&s;on they might wi&s;h would be brought forward by a &s;econd or by any &s;ub&s;equent nomination. They could not even be certain that a future nomina|tion would pre&s;ent a candidate in any degree more acceptable to them: And as their di&s;&s;ent might ca&s;t a kind of &s;tigma upon the individual rejected; and might have the appearance of a reflection upon the judgement of the chief magi&s;trate; it is not likely that their &s;anction would often be refu&s;ed, where there were not &s;pecial and &s;trong rea&s;ons for the refu&s;al.</P>
<P>To what purpo&s;e then require the co-operation of the &s;enate? I an&s;wer that the nece&s;&s;ity of their concur|rence would have a powerful, though in general a &s;ilent operation. It would be an excellent check upon a &s;pirit of favoriti&s;m in the pre&s;ident, and would tend greatly to preventing the appointment of unfit cha|racters from &s;tate prejudice, from family connection, from per&s;onal attachment, or from a view to popu|larity. And, in addition to this, it would be an effi|cacious &s;ource of &s;tability in the admini&s;tration.</P>
<P><PB N="282" REF="021127_0519_0FB249F7E961FE80">It will readily be comprehended, that a man, who had him&s;elf the &s;ole di&s;po&s;ition of offices, would be governed much more by his private inclinations and intere&s;ts, than when he was bound to &s;ubmit the pro|priety of his choice to the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion and determina|tion of a different and independent body; and that body an entire branch of the legi&s;lature. The po&s;|&s;ibility of rejection would be a &s;trong motive to care in propo&s;ing. The danger to his own reputation, and, in the ca&s;e of an elective magi&s;trate, to his poli|tical exi&s;tence, from betraying a &s;pirit of favoriti&s;m, or an unbecoming pur&s;uit of popularity, to the ob&s;er|vation of a body, who&s;e opinion would have great weight in forming that of the public, could not fail to operate as a barrier to the one and to the other. He would be both a&s;hamed and afraid to bring for|ward for the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed or lucrative &s;tations, candidates who had no other merit than that of com|ing from the &s;ame &s;tate to which he particularly be|longed, or of being in &s;ome way or other per&s;onally allied to him, or of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the nece&s;&s;ary in&s;igni|ficance and pliancy to render them the ob&s;equious in&s;truments of his plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>To this rea&s;oning, it has been objected, that the pre&s;ident, by the influence of the power of nomina|tion, may &s;ecure the complai&s;ance of the &s;enate to his views. The &s;uppo&s;ition of univer&s;al venality in human nature, is little le&s;s an error in political rea|&s;oning than the &s;uppo&s;ition of univer&s;al rectitude. The in&s;titution of delegated power implies that there is a portion of virtue and honour among mankind, which may be a rea&s;onable foundation of confidence. And experience ju&s;tifies the theory: It has been found to exi&s;t in the mo&s;t corrupt periods of the mo&s;t cor|rupt governments. The venality of the Briti&s;h hou&s;e of commons has been long a topic of accu&s;ation again&s;t that body, in the country to which they be|long, as well as in this; and it cannot be doubted that the charge is to a con&s;iderable extent well
<PB N="283" REF="021127_0520_0FB249F99E9B1D10">
founded. But it is as little to be doubted that there is always a large proportion of the body, which con|&s;i&s;ts of independent and public &s;pirited men, who have an influential weight in the councils of the nation. Hence it is (the pre&s;ent reign not excepted) that the &s;en&s;e of that body is often &s;een to control the inclinations of the monarch, both with regard to men and to mea&s;ures. Though it might therefore be allowable to &s;uppo&s;e that the executive might occa|&s;ionally influence &s;ome individuals in the &s;enate, yet the &s;uppo&s;ition that he could in general purcha&s;e the integrity of the whole body, would be forced and improbable. A man di&s;po&s;ed to view human nature as it is, without either flattering its virtues or exag|gerating its vices, will &s;ee &s;ufficient ground of confi|dence in the probity of the &s;enate, to re&s;t &s;atisfied not only that it will be impracticable to the executive to corrupt or &s;educe a majority of its members; but that the nece&s;&s;ity of its co-operation in the bu&s;ine&s;s of ap|pointments will be a con&s;iderable and &s;alutary re&s;traint upon the conduct of that magi&s;trate. Nor is the in|tegrity of the &s;enate the only reliance. The con&s;ti|tution has provided &s;ome important guards again&s;t the danger of executive influence upon the legi&s;lative body: It declares that
<Q>no &s;enator or repre&s;entative &s;hall, during the time <HI>for which he was elected,</HI> be appointed to any civil office under the United States, which &s;hall have been created, or the emo|luments whereof &s;hall have been encrea&s;ed during &s;uch time; and no per&s;on holding any office under the United States, &s;hall be a member of either hou&s;e during his continuance in office.</Q></P>

<HEAD>NUMBER LXXVII. The View of the Con&s;titution of the Pre&s;ident concluded, with a further Con&s;ideration of the Power of Appointment, and a conci&s;e Examination of his remaining Powers.</HEAD>
<P>IT has been mentioned as one of the advantages to be expected from the co-operation of the &s;enate, in the bu&s;ine&s;s of appointments, that it would con|tribute to the &s;tability of the admini&s;tration. The con&s;ent of that body would be nece&s;&s;ary to di&s;place as well as to appoint. A change of the chief magi|&s;trate therefore would not occa&s;ion &s;o violent or &s;o general a revolution in the officers of the government as might be expected if he were the &s;ole di&s;po&s;er of offices. Where a man in any &s;tation had given &s;atis|factory evidence of his fitne&s;s for it, a new pre&s;ident would be re&s;trained from attempting a change, in favor of a per&s;on more agreeable to him, by the apprehen&s;ion that the di&s;countenance of the &s;enate might fru&s;trate the attempt, and bring &s;ome degree of di&s;credit upon him&s;elf. Tho&s;e who can be&s;t e&s;timate the value of a &s;teady admini&s;tration will be mo&s;t di&s;po&s;ed to prize a provi&s;ion, which connects the official exi&s;tence of public men with the appro|bation or di&s;approbation of that body, which from the greater permanency of its own compo&s;ition, will in all probability be le&s;s &s;ubject to incon&s;tancy, than any other member of the government.</P>
<P>To this union of the &s;enate with the pre&s;ident, in the article of appointments, it has in &s;ome ca&s;es been objected, that it would &s;erve to give the pre|&s;ident an undue influence over the &s;enate; and in others, that it would have an oppo&s;ite tendency; a &s;trong proof that neither &s;ugge&s;tion is true.</P>
<P>To &s;tate the fir&s;t in its proper form is to refute it. It amounts to this; the pre&s;ident would have an
<PB N="285" REF="021127_0522_0FB24A044C0393A8">
improper <HI>influence over</HI> the &s;enate; becau&s;e the &s;enate would have the power of <HI>re&s;training</HI> him. This is an ab&s;urdity in terms. It cannot admit of a doubt that the entire power of appointment would enable him much more effectually to e&s;tabli&s;h a dangerous empire over that body, than a mere power of nomi|nation &s;ubject to their control.</P>
<P>Let us take a view of the conver&s;e of the propo|&s;ition, "The &s;enate would influence the executive." As I have had occa&s;ion to remark in &s;everal other in&s;tances, the indi&s;tinctne&s;s of the objection forbids a preci&s;e an&s;wer. In what manner is this influence to be exerted? In relation to what objects? The power of influencing a per&s;on, in the &s;en&s;e in which it is here u&s;ed, mu&s;t imply a power of conferring a benefit upon him. How could the &s;enate confer a benefit upon the pre&s;i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ent by the manner of employ|ing their right of negative upon his nominations? If it be &s;aid they might &s;ometimes gratify him by an acquie&s;cence in a favourite choice, when public motives might dictate a different conduct; I an&s;wer that the in&s;tances in which the pre&s;ident could be per&s;onally intere&s;ted in the re&s;ult, would be too few to admit of his being materially affected by the compliances of the &s;enate. Be&s;ides this, it is evident that the POWER which can <HI>originate</HI> the di&s;po&s;ition of honors and emoluments, is more likely to attract than to be attracted by the POWER which can merely ob&s;truct their cour&s;e. If by influencing the pre&s;ident be meant <HI>re&s;training</HI> him, this is preci&s;ely what mu&s;t have been intended. And it has been &s;hewn that the re&s;traint would be &s;alutary, at the &s;ame time that it would not be &s;uch as to de&s;troy a &s;ingle advantage to be looked for from the uncontroled agency of that magi&s;trate. The right of nomination would produce all the good, without the ill.</P>
<P>Upon a compari&s;on of the plan for the appointment of the officers of the propo&s;ed government with that
<PB N="286" REF="021127_0523_0FB24A062D3F05E8">
which is e&s;tabli&s;hed by the con&s;titution of this &s;tate <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> decided preference mu&s;t be given to the former. In that plan the power of nomination is unequivocally ve&s;ted in the executive. And as there would be a nece&s;&s;ity for &s;ubmitting each nomination to the judge|ment of an entire branch of the legi&s;lative, the cir|cum&s;tances attending an appointment, from the mode of conducting it, would naturally become matters of notoriety; and the public could be at no lo&s;s to deter|mine what part had been performed by the different actors. The blame of a bad nomination would fall upon the pre&s;ident &s;ingly and ab&s;olutely. The cen&s;ure of rejecting a good one would lie entirely at the door of the &s;enate; aggravated by the con&s;ideration of their having counteracted the good intentions of the executive. If an ill appointment &s;hould be made the executive for nominating and the &s;enate for approv|ing would participate though in different degrees in the opprobrium and di&s;grace.</P>
<P>The rever&s;e of all this characteri&s;es the manner of appointment in this &s;tate. The council of appoint|ment con&s;i&s;ts of from three to five per&s;ons, of whom the governor is always one. This &s;mall body, &s;hut up in a private apartment, impenetrable to the public eye, proceed to the execution of the tru&s;t committed to them. It is known that the governor claims the right of nomination, upon the &s;trength of &s;ome ambi|guous expre&s;&s;ions in the con&s;titution; but it is not known to what extent, or in what manner he exer|ci&s;es it; nor upon what occa&s;ions he is contradicted or oppo&s;ed. The cen&s;ure of a bad appointment, on account of the uncertainty of its author, and for want of a determinate object, has neither poignancy nor duration. And while an unbounded field for cabal and intrigue lies open, all idea of re&s;pon&s;ibility is lo&s;t. The mo&s;t that the public can know is, that the governor claims the right of nomination: That <HI>two</HI> out of the con&s;iderable number of <HI>four</HI> men can too often be managed without much difficulty: That if
<PB N="287" REF="021127_0524_0FB24A07B18B2AA0">
&s;ome of the members of a particular council &s;hould happen to be of an uncomplying character, it is frequently not impo&s;&s;ible to get rid of their oppo|&s;ition, by regulating the times of meeting in &s;uch a manner as to render their attendance inconvenient: And that, from whatever cau&s;e it may proceed, a great number of very improper appointments are from time to time made. Whether a governor of this &s;tate avails him&s;elf of the a&s;cendant he mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have, in this delicate and important part of the admini&s;tration, to prefer to offices men who are be&s;t qualified for them: Or whether he pro&s;titutes that advantage to the advancement of per&s;ons, who&s;e chief merit is their implicit devotion to his will, and to the &s;upport of a de&s;picable and dangerous &s;y&s;tem of per&s;onal influence, are que&s;tions which unfortu|nately for the community can only be the &s;ubjects of &s;peculation and conjecture.</P>
<P>Every mere council of appointment, however con|&s;tituted, will be a conclave, in which cabal and in|trigue will have their full &s;cope. Their number, without an unwarrantable increa&s;e of expence, cannot be large enough to preclude a facility of combina|tion. And as each member will have his friends and connections to provide for, the de&s;ire of mutual gra|tification will beget a &s;candalous bartering of votes and bargaining for places. The private attachments of one man might ea&s;ily be &s;atisfied; but to &s;atisfy the private attachments of a dozen, or of twenty men, would occa&s;ion a monopoly of all the principal em|ployments of the government, in a few families, and would lead more directly to an ari&s;tocracy or an oli|garchy, than any mea&s;ure that could be contrived. If to avoid an accumulation of offices, there was to be a frequent change in the per&s;ons who were to com|po&s;e the council, this would involve the mi&s;chiefs of a mutable admini&s;tration in their full extent. Such a council would al&s;o be more liable to executive in|fluence than the &s;enate, becau&s;e they would be fewer
<PB N="288" REF="021127_0525_0FB24A09ABD66598">
in number, and would act le&s;s immediately under the public in&s;pection. Such a council in fine as a &s;ub|&s;titute for the plan of the convention, would be pro|ductive of an increa&s;e of expence, a multiplication of the evils which &s;pring from favoriti&s;m and intrigue in the di&s;tribution of the public honors, a decrea&s;e of &s;tability in the admini&s;tration of the government, and a diminution of the &s;ecurity again&s;t an undue influ|ence of the executive. And yet &s;uch a council has been warmly contended for as an e&s;&s;ential amend|ment in the propo&s;ed con&s;titution.</P>
<P>I could not with propriety conclude my ob&s;erva|tions on the &s;ubject of appointments, without taking notice of a &s;cheme, for which there has appeared &s;ome, though but a few advocates; I mean that of uniting the hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives in the power of making them. I &s;hall however do little more than mention it, as I cannot imagine that it is likely to gain the countenance of any con&s;iderable part of the community. A body &s;o fluctuating, and at the &s;ame time &s;o numerous, can never be deemed proper for the exerci&s;e of that power. Its unfitne&s;s will appear manife&s;t to all, when it is recollected that in half a century it may con&s;i&s;t of three or four hundred per|&s;ons. All the advantages of the &s;tability, both of the executive and of the &s;enate, would be defeated by this union; and infinite delays and embarra&s;&s;ments would be occa&s;ioned. The example of mo&s;t of the &s;tates in their local con&s;titutions, encourages us to reprobate the idea.</P>
<P>The only remaining powers of the executive, are comprehended in giving information to congre&s;s of the &s;tate of the union; in recommending to their con&s;ideration &s;uch mea&s;ures as he &s;hall judge expe|dient; in convening them, or either branch, upon extraordinary occa&s;ions; in adjourning them when they cannot them&s;elves agree upon the time of adjournment; in receiving amba&s;&s;adors and other public mini&s;ters; in faithfully executing the laws;
<PB N="289" REF="021127_0526_0FB24A0DB3173170">
and in commi&s;&s;ioning all the officers of the United States.</P>
<P>Except &s;ome cavils about the power of convening <HI>either</HI> hou&s;e of the legi&s;lature and that of receiving amba&s;&s;adors, no objection has been made to this cl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;s of authorities; nor could they po&s;&s;ibly admit of a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> It required indeed an in&s;atiable avidity for cen&s;ure to invent exceptions to the parts which have been excepted to. In regard to the power of convening either hou&s;e of the legi&s;lature, I &s;hall barely remark, that in re&s;pect to the &s;enate at lea&s;t, we can readily di&s;cover a good rea&s;on for it. As this body has a concurrent power with the executive in the article of treaties, it might often be nece&s;&s;ary to call it together with a view to this object, when it would be unne|ce&s;&s;ary and improper to convene the hou&s;e of repre|&s;entatives. As to the reception of amba&s;&s;adors, what I have &s;aid in a former paper will furni&s;h a &s;ufficient an&s;wer.</P>
<P>We have now compleated a &s;urvey of the &s;tructure and powers of the executive department, which, I have endeavoured to &s;hew, combines, as far as repub|lican principles will admit, all the requi&s;ites to energy. The remaining enquiry is&mdash;does it al&s;o combine the requi&s;ites to &s;afety in the republican &s;en&s;e&mdash;a due dependence on the people&mdash;a due re&s;pon|&s;ibility? The an&s;wer to this que&s;tion has been anti|cipated in the inve&s;tigation of its other characteri&s;tics, and is &s;atisfactorily deducible from the&s;e circum|&s;tances, the election of the pre&s;ident once in four years by per&s;ons immediately cho&s;en by the people for that purpo&s;e; and his being at all times liable to impeach|ment, trial, di&s;mi&s;&s;ion from office, incapacity to &s;erve in any other; and to the forfeiture of life and e&s;tate by &s;ub&s;equent pro&s;ecution in the common cour&s;e of law. But the&s;e precautions, great as they are, are not the only ones, which the plan of the convention has provided in favor of the public &s;ecurity. In the only in&s;tances in which the abu&s;e of the executive
<PB N="290" REF="021127_0527_0FB24A0F27044FD0">
authority was materially to be feared, the chief ma|gi&s;trate of the United States would by that plan be &s;ubjected to the control of a branch of the legi&s;lative body. What more can an enlightened and rea&s;on|able people de&s;ire?</P>

<HEAD>NUMBER LXXVIII. A View of the Con&s;titution of the Judicial Department, in Relation to the Tenure of good Behaviour.</HEAD>
<P>WE proceed now to an examination of the judiciary department of the propo&s;ed go|vernment.</P>
<P>In unfolding the defects of the exi&s;ting confedera|tion, the utility and nece&s;&s;ity of a federal judicature have been clearly pointed out. It is the le&s;s nece&s;|&s;ary to recapitulate the con&s;iderations there urged; as the propriety of the in&s;titution in the ab&s;tract is not di&s;puted: The only que&s;tions which have been rai&s;ed being relative to the manner of con&s;tituting it, and to its extent. To the&s;e points therefore our ob&s;erva|tions &s;hall be confined.</P>
<P>The manner of con&s;tituting it &s;eems to embrace the&s;e &s;everal objects&mdash;1&s;t. The mode of appointing the judges&mdash;2d. The tenure by which they are to hold their places&mdash;3d. The partition of the judi|ciary authority between different courts, and their relations to each other.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t.</HI> As to the mode of appointing the judges; This is the &s;ame with that of appointing the officers of the union in general, and has been &s;o fully di&s;|cu&s;&s;ed in the two la&s;t numbers, that nothing can be &s;aid here which would not be u&s;ele&s;s repetition.</P>
<P><HI>Second.</HI> As to the tenure by which the judges are to hold their places: This chiefly concerns their
<PB N="291" REF="021127_0528_0FB24A13306D6A48">
duration in office; the provi&s;ions for their &s;upport; and the precautions for their re&s;pon&s;ibility.</P>
<P>According to the plan of the convention, all the judges who may be appointed by the United States are to hold their offices <HI>during good behaviour,</HI> which is conformable to the mo&s;t approved of the &s;tate con|&s;titutions; and among the re&s;t, to that of this &s;tate. Its propriety having been drawn into que&s;tion by the adver&s;aries of that plan, is no light &s;ymptom of the rage for objection which di&s;orders their imaginations and judgments. The &s;tandard of good behaviour for the continuance in office of the judicial magi&s;tracy is certainly one of the mo&s;t valuable of the modern im|provements in the practice of government. In a monarchy it is an excellent barrier to the de&s;poti&s;m of the prince: In a republic it is a no le&s;s excellent barrier to the encroachments and oppre&s;&s;ions of the repre&s;entative body And it is the be&s;t expedient which can be devi&s;ed in any government, to &s;ecure a &s;teady, upright and impartial admini&s;tration of the laws.</P>
<P>Whoever attentively con&s;iders the different depart|ments of power mu&s;t perceive, that in a government in which they are &s;eparated from each other, the ju|diciary, from the nature of its functions, will always be the lea&s;t dangerous to the political rights of the con&s;titution; becau&s;e it will be lea&s;t in a capacity to annoy or injure them. The executive not only di&s;|pen&s;es the honors, but holds the &s;word of the commu|nity. The legi&s;lative not only commands the pur&s;e, but pre&s;cribes the rules by which the duties and rights of every citizen are to be regulated. The judiciary on the contrary has no influence over either the &s;word or the pur&s;e, no direction either of the &s;trength or of the wealth of the &s;ociety, and can take no active re&s;o|lution whatever. It may truly be &s;aid to have nei|ther FORCE nor WILL, but merely judgment; and mu&s;t ultimately depend upon the aid of the executive arm even for the efficacy of its judgments.</P>
<P><PB N="292" REF="021127_0529_0FB24A15CEB42518">This &s;imple view of the matter &s;ugge&s;ts &s;everal important con&s;equences. It proves inconte&s;tibly that the judiciary is beyond compari&s;on the weake&s;t of the three departments of power<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The celebrated Monte&s;quieu &s;peaking of them &s;ays,
<Q>of the three powers above mentioned, the JUDICIARY is next to nothing.</Q>
Spirit of Laws, vol. 1. page 186.</NOTE>; that it can never attack with &s;uc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;s either of the other two; and that all po&s;|&s;ible care is requi&s;ite to enable it to defend it&s;elf again&s;t their attacks. It equally proves, that though indi|vidual oppre&s;&s;ion may now and then proceed from the courts of ju&s;tice, the general liberty of the people can never be endangered from that quarter: I mean, &s;o long as the judiciary remains truly di&s;tinct from both the legi&s;lative and executive. For I agree that
<Q>there is no liberty, if the power of judging be not &s;epa|rated from the legi&s;lative and executive powers<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Idem. page 181.</NOTE>.</Q>
And it proves, in the la&s;t place, that as liberty can have nothing to fear from the judiciary alone, but would have every thing to fear from its union with either of the other departments; that as all the effects of &s;uch an union mu&s;t en&s;ue from a dependence of the former on the latter, notwith&s;tanding a nominal and apparent &s;eparation; that as from the natural feeblene&s;s of the judiciary, it is in continual jeopardy of being overpowered, awed or influenced by its co|ordinate branches; and that as nothing can contri|bute &s;o much to its firmne&s;s and independence, as permanency in office, this quality may therefore be ju&s;tly regarded as an indi&s;pen&s;able ingredient in its con&s;titution; and in a great mea&s;ure as the citadel of the public ju&s;tice and the public &s;ecurity.</P>
<P>The complete independence of the courts of ju&s;tice is peculiarly e&s;&s;ential in a limited con&s;titution. By a limited con&s;titution I under&s;tand one which contains certain &s;pecified exceptions to the legi&s;lative autho|rity; &s;uch for in&s;tance as that it &s;hall pa&s;s no bills of attainder, no <HI>ex po&s;t facto</HI> laws, and the like. Limi|tations of this kind can be pre&s;erved in practice no
<PB N="293" REF="021127_0530_0FB24A18EFB3E230">
other way than through the medium of the courts of ju&s;tice; who&s;e duty it mu&s;t be to declare all acts con|trary to the manife&s;t tenor of the con&s;titution void. Without this, all the re&s;ervations of particular rights or privileges would amount to nothing.</P>
<P>Some perplexity re&s;pecting the right of the courts to pronounce legi&s;lative acts void, becau&s;e contrary to the con&s;titution, has ari&s;en from an imagination that the doctrine would imply a &s;uperiority of the ju|diciary to the legi&s;lative power. It is urged that the authority which can declare the acts of another void, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be &s;uperior to the one who&s;e acts may be declared void. As this doctrine is of great im|portance in all the American con&s;titutions, a brief di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the grounds on which it re&s;ts cannot be unacceptable.</P>
<P>There is no po&s;ition which depends on clearer prin|ciples, than that every act of a delegated authority, contrary to the tenor of the commi&s;&s;ion under which it is exerc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ed, is void. No legi&s;lative act therefore contrary to the con&s;titution can be valid. To deny this would be to affirm that the deputy is greater than his principal; that the &s;ervant is above his ma&s;ter; that the repre&s;entatives of the people are &s;uperior to the peop<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e them&s;elves; that men acting by virtue of powers may do not only what their powers do not authori&s;e, but what they forbid.</P>
<P>If it be &s;aid that the legi&s;lative body are them&s;elves the con&s;titutional judges of their own powers, and that the con&s;truction they put upon them is conclu&s;ive upon the other departments, it may be an&s;wered, that this cannot be the natural pre&s;umption, where it is not to be collected from any particular provi&s;ions in the con&s;titution. It is not otherwi&s;e to be &s;uppo&s;ed that the con&s;titution could intend to enable the repre|&s;entatives of the people to &s;ub&s;titute their <HI>will</HI> to that of their con&s;tituents. It is far more rational to &s;up|po&s;e that the courts were de&s;igned to be an interme|diate body between the people and the legi&s;lature, in
<PB N="294" REF="021127_0531_0FB24A1A68267910">
order, among other things, to keep the latter within the limits a&s;&s;igned to their authority. The interpre|tation of the laws is the proper and peculiar province of the courts. A con&s;titution is in fact, and mu&s;t be, regarded by the judges as a fundamental law. It therefore belongs to them to a&s;certain its meaning as well as the meaning of any particular act proceeding from the legi&s;lative body. If there &s;hould happen to be an irreconcileable variance between the two, that which has the &s;uperior obligation and validity ought of cour&s;e to be prefered; or in other words, the con|&s;titution ought to be prefered to the &s;tatute, the inten|tion of the people to the intention of their agents.</P>
<P>Nor does this conclu&s;ion by any means &s;uppo&s;e a &s;uperiority of the judicial to the legi&s;lative power. It only &s;uppo&s;es that the power of the people is &s;upe|rior to both; and that where the will of the legi&s;|lature declared in its &s;tatutes, &s;tands in oppo&s;ition to that of the people declared in the con&s;titution, the judges ought to be governed by the latter, rather than the former. They ought to regulate their deci&s;ions by the fundamental laws, rather than by tho&s;e which are not fundamental.</P>
<P>This exerci&s;e of judicial di&s;cretion in determining between two contradictory laws, is exemplified in a familiar in&s;tance. It not uncommonly happens, that there are two &s;tatutes exi&s;ting at one time, cla&s;hing in whole or in part with each other, and neither of them containing any repealing clau&s;e or expre&s;&s;ion. In &s;uch a ca&s;e, it is the province of the courts to liquidate and fix their meaning and operation: So far as they can by any fair con&s;truction be reconciled to each other; rea&s;on and law con&s;pire to dictate that this &s;hould be done: Where this is impracticable, it becomes a matter of nece&s;&s;ity to give effect to one, in exclu&s;ion of the other. The rule which has obtained in the courts for determining their relative validity is that the la&s;t in order of time &s;hall be pre|ferred to the fir&s;t. But this is mere rule of con&s;truc|tion,
<PB N="295" REF="021127_0532_0FB24A1BEBF6AF38">
not derived from any po&s;itive law, but from the nature and rea&s;on of the thing. It is a rule not enjoined upon the courts by legi&s;lative provi&s;ion, but adopted by them&s;elves, as con&s;onant to truth and propriety, for the direction of their conduct as inter|preters of the law. They thought it rea&s;onable, that between the interfering acts of an <HI>equal</HI> authority, that which was the la&s;t indication of its will, &s;hould have the preference.</P>
<P>But in regard to the interfering acts of a &s;uperior and &s;ubordinate authority, of an original and deri|vative power, the nature and rea&s;on of the thing indicate the conver&s;e of that rule as proper to be followed. They teach us that the prior act of a &s;uperior ought to be prefered to the &s;ub&s;equent act of an inferior and &s;ubordinate authority; and that, accordingly, whenever a particular &s;tatute con|travenes the con&s;titution, it will be the duty of the judicial tribunals to adhere to the latter, and di&s;|regard the former.</P>
<P>It can be of no weight to &s;ay, that the courts on the pretence of a repugnancy, may &s;ub&s;titute their own plea&s;ure to the con&s;titutional intentions of the legi&s;lature. This might as well happen in the ca&s;e of two contradictory &s;tatutes; or it might as well happen in every adjudication upon any &s;ingle &s;tatute. The courts mu&s;t declare the &s;en&s;e of the law; and if they &s;hould be di&s;po&s;ed to exerci&s;e WILL in&s;tead of JUDGMENT, the con&s;equence would equally be the &s;ub&s;titution of their plea&s;ure to that of the legi&s;lative body. The ob&s;ervation, if it proved any thing, would prove that there ought to be no judges di&s;tinct from that body.</P>
<P>If then the courts of ju&s;tice are to be con&s;idered as the bulwarks of a limited con&s;titution again&s;t legi&s;|lative encroachments, this con&s;ideration will afford a &s;trong argument for the permanent tenure of judicial offices, &s;ince nothing will contribute &s;o much as this to that independent &s;pirit in the judges, which
<PB N="296" REF="021127_0533_0FB24A1DE95B72B8">
mu&s;t be e&s;&s;ential to the faithful performance of &s;o arduous a duty.</P>
<P>This independence of the judges is equally requi&s;ite to guard the con&s;titution and the rights of individuals from the effects of tho&s;e ill humours which the arts of de&s;igning men, or the influence of parti|cular conjunctures &s;ometimes di&s;&s;eminate among the people them&s;elves, and which, though they &s;peedily give place to better information and more deliberate reflection, have a tendency in the mean time to occa&s;ion dangerous innovations in the government, and &s;erious oppre&s;&s;ions of the minor party in the community. Though I tru&s;t the friends of the pro|po&s;ed con&s;titution will never concur with its enemies<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide Prote&s;t of the minority of the convention of Penn&s;yl|vania, Martin's &s;peech, &amp;c.</NOTE> in que&s;tioning that fundamental principle of re|publican government, which admits the right of the people to alter or aboli&s;h the e&s;tabli&s;hed con&s;titution whenever they find it incon&s;i&s;tent with their happine&s;s; yet it is not to be inferred from this principle, that the repre&s;entatives of the people, whenever a mo|mentary inclination happens to lay hold of a majority of their con&s;tituents incompatible with the provi&s;ions in the exi&s;ting con&s;titution, would on that account be ju&s;tifiable in a violation of tho&s;e provi&s;ions; or that the courts would be under a greater obligation to connive at infractions in this &s;hape, than when they had proceeded wholly from the cabals of the repre&s;entative body. Until the people have by &s;ome &s;olemn and authoritative act annul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed or changed the e&s;tabli&s;hed form, it is binding upon them&s;elves col|lectively, as well as individually; and no pre&s;ump|tion, or even knowledge of their &s;entiments, can warrant their repre&s;entatives in a departure from it, prior to &s;uch an act. But it is ea&s;y to &s;ee that it would require an uncommon portion of fortitude in the judges to do their duty as faithful guardians of the con&s;titution, where legi&s;lative inva&s;ions of it
<PB N="297" REF="021127_0534_0FB24A1F91C86DE0">
had been in&s;tigated by the major voice of the community.</P>
<P>But it is not with a view to infractions of the con&s;titution only that the independence of the judges may be an e&s;&s;ential &s;afeguard again&s;t the effects of occa&s;ional ill humours in the &s;ociety. The&s;e &s;ome|times extend no farther than to the injury of the private rights of particular cla&s;&s;es of citizens, by unju&s;t and partial laws. Here al&s;o the firmne&s;s of the judicial magi&s;tracy is of va&s;t importance in miti|gating the &s;everity, and confining the operation of &s;uch laws. It not only &s;erves to moderate the imme|diate mi&s;chiefs of tho&s;e which may have been pa&s;&s;ed, but it operates as a check upon the legi&s;lative body in pa&s;&s;ing them; who, perceiving that ob&s;tacles to the &s;ucce&s;s of an iniquitous intention are to be ex|pected from the &s;cruples of the courts, are in a manner compelled by the very motives of the inju&s;tice they meditate, to qualify their attempts. This is a circum&s;tance calculated to have more influence upon the character of our governments, than but few may be aware of. The benefits of the integrity and moderation of the judiciary have already been felt in more &s;tates than one; and though they may have di&s;plea&s;ed tho&s;e who&s;e &s;ini&s;ter expectations they may have di&s;appointed, they mu&s;t have commanded the e&s;teem and applau&s;e of all the virtuous and di&s;inter|e&s;ted. Con&s;iderate men of every de&s;cription ought to prize whatever will tend to beget or fortify that temper in the courts; as no man can be &s;ure that he may not be to-morrow the victim of a &s;pirit of inju&s;tice, by which he may be a gainer to-day. And every man mu&s;t now feel that the inevitable ten|dency of &s;uch a &s;pirit is to &s;ap the foundations of public and private confidence, and to introduce in its &s;tead, univer&s;al di&s;tru&s;t and di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>That inflexible and uniform adherence to the rights of the con&s;titution and of individuals, which we perceive to be indi&s;pen&s;able in the courts of
<PB N="298" REF="021127_0535_0FB24A235A240FF8">
ju&s;tice, can certainly not be expected from judges who hold their offices by a temporary commi&s;&s;ion. Perio|dical appointments, however regulated, or by whom|&s;oever made, would in &s;ome way or other be fatal to their nece&s;&s;ary independence. If the power of making them was committed either to the executive or legi&s;|lative, there would be danger of an improper com|plai&s;ance to the branch which po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed it; if to both, there would be an unwillingne&s;s to hazard the di&s;|plea&s;ure of either; if to the people, or to per&s;ons cho&s;en by them for the &s;pecial purpo&s;e, there would be too great a di&s;po&s;ition to con&s;ult popularity, to ju&s;tify a reliance that nothing would be con&s;ulted but the con&s;titution and the laws.</P>
<P>There is yet a further and a weighty rea&s;on for the permanency of the judicial offices; which is deducible from the nature of the qualifications they require. It has been frequently remarked with great pro|priety, that a voluminous code of laws is one of the inconveniencies nece&s;&s;arily connected with the advan|tages of a free government. To avoid an arbitrary di&s;cretion in the courts, it is indi&s;pen&s;able that they &s;hould be bound down by &s;trict rules and precedents, which &s;erve to define and point out their duty in every particular ca&s;e that comes before them; and it will readily be conceived from the variety of con|trover&s;ies which grow out of the folly and wickedne&s;s of mankind, that the records of tho&s;e precedents mu&s;t unavoidably &s;well to a very con&s;iderable bulk, and mu&s;t demand long and laborious &s;tudy to acquire a competent knowledge of them. Hence it is that there can be but few men in the &s;ociety, who will have &s;ufficient &s;kill in the laws to qualify them for the &s;tations of judges. And making the proper deduc|tions for the ordinary depravity of human nature, the number mu&s;t be &s;till &s;maller of tho&s;e who unite the requi&s;ite integrity with the requi&s;ite knowledge. The&s;e con&s;iderations appri&s;e us, that the govern|ment can have no great option between fit cha|racters;
<PB N="299" REF="021127_0536_0FB24A2428700530">
and that a temporary duration in office, which would naturally di&s;courage &s;uch characters from quiting a lucrative line of practice to accept a &s;eat on the bench, would have a tendency to throw the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice into hands le&s;s able, and le&s;s well qualified to conduct it with utility and dignity. In the pre&s;ent circum&s;tances of this country, and in tho&s;e in which it is likely to be for a long time to come, the di&s;advantages on this &s;core would be greater than they may at fir&s;t fight appear; but it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed that they are far inferior to tho&s;e which pre&s;ent them&s;elves under the other a&s;pects of the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>Upon the whole there can be no room to doubt that the convention acted wi&s;ely in copying from the models of tho&s;e con&s;titutions which have e&s;ta|bli&s;hed <HI>good behaviour</HI> as the tenure of their judicial offices in point of duration; and that &s;o far from being blameable on this account, their plan would have been inexcu&s;eably defective if it had wanted this important feature of good government. The experience of Great Britain affords an illu&s;trious comment on the excellence of the in&s;titution.</P>

<HEAD>NUMBER LXXIX. A further View of the Judicial Department, in Relation to the Provi&s;ions for the Sup|port and Re&s;pon&s;ibility of the Judges.</HEAD>
<P>NEXT to permanency in office, nothing can contribute more to the independence of the judges than a fixed provi&s;ion for their &s;upport. The remark made in relation to the pre|&s;ident, is equally applicable here. In the general cour&s;e of human nature, <HI>a power over a man's &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence
<PB N="300" REF="021127_0537_0FB24A2DA41C9160">
amounts to a power over his will.</HI> And we can never hope to &s;ee reali&s;ed in practice the complete &s;eparation of the judicial from the legi&s;lative power, in any &s;y&s;tem, which leaves the former dependent for pecuniary re&s;ources on the occa&s;ional grants of the latter. The enlightened friends to good government, in every &s;tate, have &s;een cau&s;e to lament the want of p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e and explicit precautions in the &s;tate con&s;titu|tions on this h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">d. Some of the&s;e indeed have de|clared that <HI>permanent</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide Con&s;titution of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, Chap. 2. Sect. 1. Art. 13.</NOTE> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">alaries &s;hould be e&s;tabli&s;hed for the judges; but the experiment has in &s;ome in|&s;tances &s;hewn that &s;uch expre&s;&s;ions are not &s;ufficiently definite to preclude legi&s;lative eva&s;ions. Something &s;till more po&s;itive and unequivocal has been evinced to be requi&s;ite. The plan of the convention accord|ingly has provided, that the judges of the United States
<Q>&s;hall at <HI>&s;tated times</HI> receive for their &s;ervices a compen&s;ation, which &s;hall not be <HI>dimini&s;hed</HI> during their continuance in office.</Q></P>
<P>This, all circum&s;tances con&s;idered, is the mo&s;t eli|gible provi&s;ion that could have been devi&s;ed. It will readily be under&s;tood, that the fluctuations in the value of money, and in the &s;tate of &s;ociety, rendered a fixed rate of compen&s;ation in the con&s;titution inad|mi&s;&s;ible. What might be extravagant to day, might in half a century become penurious and inadequate. It was therefore nece&s;&s;ary to leave it to the di&s;cretion of the legi&s;lature to vary its provi&s;ions in conformity to the variations in circum&s;tances; yet under &s;uch re&s;trictions as to put it out of the power of that body to change the condition of the individual for the wor&s;e. A man may then be &s;ure of the ground upon which he &s;tands, and can never be deterred from his duty by the apprehen&s;ion of being placed in a le&s;s eligible &s;ituation. The clau&s;e which has been quoted combines both advantages. The &s;alaries of judicial offices may from time to time be altered, as occa&s;ion
<PB N="301" REF="021127_0538_0FB24A315BCFDF80">
&s;hall require, yet &s;o as never to le&s;&s;en the allowance with which any particular judge comes into office, in re&s;pect to him. It will be ob&s;erved that a difference has been made by the convention between the com|pen&s;ation of the pre&s;ident and of the judges. That of the former can neither be increa&s;ed nor dimini&s;hed. That of the latter can only not be dimini&s;hed. This probably aro&s;e from the difference in the duration of the re&s;pective offices. As the pre&s;ident is to be elected for no more than four years, it can rarely happen that an adequate &s;alary, fixed at the com|mencement of that period, will not continue to be &s;uch to the end of it. But with regard to the judges, who, if they behave properly, will be &s;ecured in their places for life, it may well happen, e&s;pecially in the early &s;tages of the government, that a &s;tipend, which would be very &s;ufficient at their fir&s;t appointment, would become too &s;mall in the progre&s;s of their &s;ervice.</P>
<P>This provi&s;ion for the &s;upport of the judges bears every mark of prudence and efficacy; and it may be &s;afely affirmed that, together with the permanent tenure of their offices, it affords a better pro&s;pect of their independence than is di&s;coverable in the con&s;ti|tutions of any of the &s;tates, in regard to their own judges.</P>
<P>The precautions for their re&s;pon&s;ibility are com|pri&s;ed in the article re&s;pecting impeachments. They are liable to be impeached for mal-conduct by the hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives, and tried by the &s;enate, and if convicted, may be di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from office and di&s;qua|lified for holding any other. This is the only pro|vi&s;ion on the point, which is con&s;i&s;tent with the nece&s;|&s;ary independence of the judicial character, and is the only one which we find in our own con&s;titution in re&s;pect to our own judges.</P>
<P>The want of a provi&s;ion for removing the judges on account of inability, has been a &s;ubject of com|plaint. But all con&s;iderate men will be &s;en&s;ible that
<PB N="302" REF="021127_0539_0FB24A33F9EB5CB0">
&s;uch a provi&s;ion would either not be practi&s;ed upon, or would be more liable to abu&s;e than calculated to an&s;wer any good purpo&s;e. The men&s;uration of the faculties of the mind has, I believe, no place in the catalogue of known arts. An attempt to fix the boundary between the regions of ability and inability, would much oftener give &s;cope to per&s;onal and party attachments and enmities, than advance the intere&s;ts of ju&s;tice, or the public good. The re&s;ult, except in the ca&s;e of in&s;anity, mu&s;t for the mo&s;t part be arbitrary; and in&s;anity without any formal or expre&s;s provi&s;ion, may be &s;afely pronounced to be a virtual di&s;qualification.</P>
<P>The con&s;titution of New-York, to avoid inve&s;ti|gations that mu&s;t forever be vague and dangerous, has taken a particular age as the criterion of in|ability. No man can be a judge beyond &s;ixty. I believe there are few at pre&s;ent, who do not di&s;|approve of this provi&s;ion. There is no &s;tation in relation to which it is le&s;s proper than to that of a judge. The deliberating and comparing faculties generally pre&s;erve their &s;trength much beyond that period, in men who &s;urvive it; and when in addi|tion to this circum&s;tance, we con&s;ider how few there are who outlive the &s;ea&s;on of intellectual vigour, and how improbable it is that any con&s;iderable propor|tion of the bench, whether more or le&s;s numerous, &s;hould be in &s;uch a &s;ituation at the &s;ame time, we &s;hall be ready to conclude that limitations of this &s;ort have little to recommend them. In a republic, where fortunes are not affluent, and pen&s;ions not expedient, the di&s;mi&s;&s;ion of men from &s;tations in which they have &s;erved their country long and u&s;e|fully, on which they depend for &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, and from which it will be too late to re&s;ort to any other occupation for a livelihood, ought to have &s;ome bet|ter apology to humanity, than is to be found in the imaginary danger of a &s;uperannuated bench.</P>

<HEAD>NUMBER LXXX. A further View of the Judicial Department, in Relation to the Extent of its Powers.</HEAD>
<P>TO judge with accuracy of the proper extent of the federal judicature, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to con&s;ider in the fir&s;t place what are its proper objects.</P>
<P>It &s;eems &s;carcely to admit of controver&s;y that the judiciary authority of the union ought to extend to the&s;e &s;everal de&s;criptions of cau&s;es. 1&s;t. To all tho&s;e which ari&s;e out of the laws of the United States, pa&s;&s;ed in pur&s;uance of their ju&s;t and con&s;titutional powers of legi&s;lation; 2d. to all tho&s;e which concern the execution of the provi&s;ions expre&s;sly contained in the articles of union; 3d. to all tho&s;e in which the United States are a party; 4th. to all tho&s;e which involve the PEACE of the CONFEDERACY, whether they relate to the intercour&s;e between the United States and foreign nations, or to that between the States them&s;elves; 5th. to all tho&s;e which originate on the high &s;eas, and are of admiralty or maritime juri&s;dic|tion; and la&s;tly, to all tho&s;e in which the &s;tate tribunals cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed to be impartial and unbia&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t point depends upon this obvious con&s;ide|tation that there ought always to be a con&s;titutional method of giving efficacy to con&s;titutional provi&s;ions. What for in&s;tance would avail re&s;trictions on the au|thority of the &s;tate legi&s;latures, without &s;ome con&s;ti|tutional mode of enforcing the ob&s;ervance of them? The &s;tates, by the plan of the convention are prohi|bited from doing a variety of things; &s;ome of which are incompatible with the intere&s;ts of the union, and others with the principles of good government. The impo&s;ition of duties on imported articles, and the emi&s;&s;ion of paper money, are &s;pecimens of each kind. No man of &s;en&s;e will believe that &s;uch prohibitions
<PB N="304" REF="021127_0541_0FB24A36FA8F93C0">
would be &s;crupulou&s;ly regarded, without &s;ome effec|tual power in the government to re&s;train or correct the infractions of them. This power mu&s;t either be a direct negative on the &s;tate laws, or an authority in the federal courts, to over-rule &s;uch as might be in manife&s;t contravention of the articles of union. There is no third cour&s;e that I can imagine. The latter appears to have been thought by the convention pre|ferable to the former, and I pre&s;ume will be mo&s;t agreeable to the &s;tates.</P>
<P>As to the &s;econd point, it is impo&s;&s;ible by any argument or comment to make it clearer than it is in it&s;elf. If there are &s;uch things as political axioms, the propriety of the judicial power of a government being co-exten&s;ive with its legi&s;lative, may be ranked among the number. The mere nece&s;&s;ity of unifor|mity in the interpretation of the national laws, de|cides the que&s;tion. Thirteen independent courts of final juri&s;diction over the &s;ame cau&s;es, ari&s;ing upon the &s;ame laws, is a hydra in government, from which nothing but contradiction and confu&s;ion can proceed.</P>
<P>Still le&s;s need be &s;aid in regard to the third point. Controver&s;ies between the nation and its members or citizens, can only be properly referred to the national tribunals. Any other plan would be contrary to rea&s;on, to precedent, and to decorum.</P>
<P>The fourth point re&s;ts on this plain propo&s;ition, that the peace of the WHOLE ought not to be left at the di&s;po&s;al of a PART. The union will undoubtedly be an&s;werable to foreign powers for the conduct of its members. And the re&s;pon&s;ibility for an injury ought ever to be accompanied with the faculty of preventing it. As the denial or perver&s;ion of ju&s;tice by the &s;entences of courts, as well as in any other manner, is with rea&s;on cla&s;&s;ed among the ju&s;t cau&s;es of war, it will follow that the federal judiciary ought to have cognizance of all cau&s;es in which the citizens of other countries are concerned. This is not le&s;s e&s;&s;ential to the pre&s;ervation of the public faith, than to the
<PB N="305" REF="021127_0542_0FB24A3868EF8DA0">
&s;ecurity of the public tranquility. A di&s;tinction may perhaps be imagined between ca&s;es ari&s;ing upon treaties and the laws of nations, and tho&s;e which may &s;tand merely on the footing of the municipal law. The former kind may be &s;uppo&s;ed proper for the federal juri&s;diction, the latter for that of the &s;tates. But it is at lea&s;t problematical whether an unju&s;t &s;entence again&s;t a foreigner, where the &s;ubject of controver&s;y was wholly relative to the <HI>lex loci,</HI> would not, if unredre&s;&s;ed, be an aggre&s;&s;ion upon his &s;ove|reign, as well as one which violated the &s;tipulations in a treaty or the general laws of nations. And a &s;till greater objection to the di&s;tinction would re&s;ult from the immen&s;e difficulty, if not impo&s;&s;ibility, of a practical di&s;crimination between the ca&s;es of one complection and tho&s;e of the other. So great a pro|portion of the ca&s;es in which foreigners are parties involve national que&s;tions, that it is by far mo&s;t &s;afe and mo&s;t expedient to refer all tho&s;e in which they are concerned to the national tribunals.</P>
<P>The power of determining cau&s;es between two &s;tates, between one &s;tate and the citizens of another, and between the citizens of different &s;tates, is perhaps not le&s;s e&s;&s;ential to the peace of the union than that which has been ju&s;t examined. Hi&s;tory gives us a horrid picture of the di&s;&s;entions and private wars which di&s;tracted and de&s;olated Germany prior to the in&s;titution of the IMPERIAL CHAMBER by Maxi|milian, towards the clo&s;e of the fifteenth century; and informs us at the &s;ame time of the va&s;t influence of that in&s;titution in appea&s;ing the di&s;orders and e&s;tabli&s;hing the tranquillity of the empire. This was a court inve&s;ted with authority to decide finally all differences between the members of the Ger|manic body.</P>
<P>A method of terminating territorial di&s;putes be|tween the &s;tates, under the authority of the federal head, was not unattended to, even in the imperfect &s;y&s;tem by which they have been hitherto held to|gether.
<PB N="306" REF="021127_0543_0FB24A39F138DC50">
But there are many other &s;ources, be&s;ides interfering claims of boundary, from which bicker|ings and animo&s;ities may &s;pring up among the mem|bers of the union. To &s;ome of the&s;e we have been witne&s;&s;es in the cour&s;e of our pa&s;t experience. It will readily be conjectured that I allude to the frau|dulent laws which have been pa&s;&s;ed in too many of the &s;tates. And though the propo&s;ed con&s;titution e&s;tabli&s;hes particular guards again&s;t the repetition of tho&s;e in&s;tances which have heretofore made their ap|pearance, yet it is warrantable to apprehend that the &s;pirit which produced them will a&s;&s;ume new &s;hapes that could not be fore&s;een, nor &s;pecifically provided again&s;t. Whatever practices may have a tendency to di&s;turb the harmony between the &s;tates, are proper objects of federal &s;uperintendence and control.</P>
<P>It may be e&s;teemed the ba&s;is of the union, that
<Q>the citizens of each &s;tate &s;hall be entitled to all the privileges and immunities of citizens of the &s;everal &s;tates.</Q>
And if it be a ju&s;t principle that every government <HI>ought to po&s;&s;e&s;s the means of exe|cuting its own provi&s;ions by its own authority,</HI> it will follow, that in order to the inviolable maintenance of that equality of privileges and immunities to which the citizens of the union will be entitled, the national judiciary ought to pre&s;ide in all ca&s;es in which one &s;tate or its citizens are oppo&s;ed to another &s;tate or its citizens. To &s;ecure the full effect of &s;o fundamental a provi&s;ion again&s;t all eva&s;ion and &s;ub|terfuge, it is nece&s;&s;ary that its con&s;truction &s;hould be committed to that tribunal, which, having no local attachments, will be likely to be impartial between the different &s;tates and their citizens, and which, owing its official exi&s;tence to the union, will never be likely to feel any bias inau&s;picious to the prin|ciples on which it is founded.</P>
<P>The fifth point will demand little animadver&s;ion. The mo&s;t bigotted idolizers of &s;tate authority have not thus far &s;hewn a di&s;po&s;ition to deny the national
<PB N="307" REF="021127_0544_0FB24A3C7AB488B0">
judiciary the cognizance of maritime cau&s;es. The&s;e &s;o generally depend on the laws of nations, and &s;o commonly affect the rights of foreigners, that they fall within the con&s;ideration<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> which are relative to the public peace. The mo&s;t important part of them are by the pre&s;ent confederation &s;ubmitted to federal juri&s;diction.</P>
<P>The rea&s;onablene&s;s of the agency of the national courts in ca&s;es in which the &s;tate tribunals cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed to be impartial, &s;peaks for it&s;elf. No man ought certainly to be a judge in his own cau&s;e, or in any cau&s;e in re&s;pect to which he has the lea&s;t in|tere&s;t or bias. This principle has no incon&s;iderable weight in de&s;ignating the federal courts as the proper tribunals for the determination of controver&s;ies between different &s;tates and their citizens. And it ought to have the &s;ame operation in regard to &s;ome ca&s;es between the citizens of the &s;ame &s;tate. Claims to land under grants of different &s;tates, founded upon adver&s;e preten&s;ions of boundary, are of this de&s;crip|tion. The courts of neither of the granting &s;tates could be expected to be unbia&s;&s;ed. The laws may have even prejudged the que&s;tion, and tied the courts down to deci&s;ions in favour of the grants of the &s;tate to which they belonged. And even where this had not been done, it would be natural that the judges, as men, &s;hould feel a &s;trong predilection to the claims of their own government.</P>
<P>Having thus laid down and di&s;cu&s;&s;ed the principles which ought to regulate the con&s;titution of the federal judiciary, we will proceed to te&s;t, by the&s;e principles, the particular powers of which, accord|ing to the plan of the convention, it is to be com|po&s;ed. It is to comprehend,
<Q>all ca&s;es in law and equity ari&s;ing under the con&s;titution, the laws of the United States, and treaties made, or which &s;hall be made under their authority; to all ca&s;es affecting amba&s;&s;adors, other public mini&s;ters and con&s;uls; to all ca&s;es of admiralty and maritime
<PB N="308" REF="021127_0545_0FB24A3F2663D1E0">
juri&s;diction; to controver&s;ies to which the United States &s;hall be a party; to controver&s;ies between two or more &s;tates, between a &s;tate and citizens of another &s;tate, between citizens of different &s;tates, between citizens of the &s;ame &s;tate claiming lands under grants of different &s;tates, and between a &s;tate or the citizens thereof, and foreign &s;tates, citizens and &s;ubjects.</Q>
This con&s;titutes the entire ma&s;s of the judicial authority of the union. Let us now review it in detail. It is then to extend,</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t.</HI> To all ca&s;es in law and equity <HI>ari&s;ing under the con&s;titution</HI> and <HI>the laws of the United States.</HI> This corre&s;ponds to the two fir&s;t cla&s;&s;es of cau&s;es which have been enumerated as proper for the juri&s;diction of the United States. It has been a&s;ked what is meant by "ca&s;es ari&s;ing under the con&s;titution," in con|tradi&s;tinction from tho&s;e
<Q>ari&s;ing under the laws of the United States.</Q>
The difference has been already explained. All the re&s;trictions upon the authority of the &s;tate legi&s;latures, furni&s;h examples of it. They are not, for in&s;tance, to emit paper money; but the interdiction re&s;ults from the con&s;ti|tution, and will have no connection with any law of the United States. Should paper money, notwith|&s;tanding, be emitted, the controver&s;ies concerning it would be ca&s;es ari&s;ing upon the con&s;titution, and not upon the laws of the United States, in the ordi|nary &s;ignification of the terms. This may &s;erve as a &s;ample of the whole.</P>
<P>It has al&s;o been a&s;ked, what need of the word "equity"? What equitable cau&s;es can grow out of the con&s;titution and laws of the United States? There is hardly a &s;ubject of litigation between indi|viduals. which may not involve tho&s;e ingredients of <HI>fraud, accident, tru&s;t</HI> or <HI>hard&s;hip,</HI> which would render the matter an object of equitable, rather than of legal juri&s;diction, as the di&s;tinction is known and e&s;ta|bli&s;hed in &s;everal of the &s;tates. It is the peculiar province, for in&s;tance, of a court of equity to relieve
<PB N="309" REF="021127_0546_0FB24A4290F17A88">
again&s;t what are called hard bargains: The&s;e are contracts, in which, though there may have been no direct fraud or deceit, &s;ufficient to invalidate them in a court of law; yet there may have been &s;ome undue and uncon&s;cionable advantage taken of the nece&s;&s;ities or misfortunes of one of the parties, which a court of equity would not tolerate. In &s;uch ca&s;es, where foreigners were concerned on either &s;ide, it would be impo&s;&s;ible for the federal judi|catories to do ju&s;tice without an equitable, as well as a legal juri&s;diction. Agreements to convey lands claimed under the grants of different &s;tates, may afford another example of the nece&s;&s;ity of an equi|table juri&s;diction in the federal courts. This rea|&s;oning may not be &s;o palpable in tho&s;e &s;tates where the formal and technical di&s;tinction between LAW and EQUITY is not maintained as in this &s;tate, where it is exemplified by every day's practice.</P>

<P>From this review of the particular powers of the federal judiciary, as marked out in the con&s;titution, it appears, that they are all conformable to the prin|ciples which ought to have governed the &s;tructure of that department, and which were nece&s;&s;ary to the perfection of the &s;y&s;tem. If &s;ome partial inconve|niencies &s;hould appear to be connected with the in|corporation of any of them into the plan, it ought to be recollected that the national legi&s;lature will have ample authority to make &s;uch <HI>exceptions</HI> and to pre&s;cribe &s;uch regulations as will be calculated to obviate or remove the&s;e inconveniencies.

<HEAD>NUMBER LXXXI. A further View of the Judicial Department, in Relation to the Di&s;tribution of its Authority.</HEAD>
<P>LET us now return to the partition of the judi|ciary authority between different courts, and their relations to each other.</P>
<P><Q>The judicial power of the United States is (by the plan of the convention) to be ve&s;ted in one &s;upreme court, and in &s;uch inferior courts as the
<PB N="311" REF="021127_0548_0FB24A487B31E288">
congre&s;s may from time to time ordain and e&s;tabli&s;h.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Article 3. Sec. 1.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P>That there ought to be one court of &s;upreme and final juri&s;diction is a propo&s;ition which has not been, and is not likely to be conte&s;ted. The rea&s;ons for it have been a&s;&s;igned in another place, and are too obvious to need repetition. The only que&s;tion that &s;eems to have been rai&s;ed concerning it, is whether it ought to be a di&s;tinct body, or a branch of the legi&s;lature. The &s;ame contradiction is ob&s;ervable in regard to this matter, which has been remarked in &s;everal other ca&s;es. The very men who object to the &s;enate as a court of impeachments, on the ground of an im|proper intermixture of powers, advocate, by impli|cation at lea&s;t, the propriety of ve&s;ting the ultimate deci&s;ion of all cau&s;es in the whole, or in a part of the legi&s;lative body.</P>
<P>The arguments or rather &s;ugge&s;tions, upon which this charge is founded, are to this effect:
<Q>The authority of the propo&s;ed &s;upreme court of the United States, which is to be a &s;eparate and inde|pendent body, will be &s;uperior to that of the legi&s;lature. The power of con&s;truing the laws, according to the <HI>&s;pirit</HI> of the con&s;titution, will enable that court to mould them into whatever &s;hape it may think proper; e&s;pecially as its de|ci&s;ions will not be in any manner &s;ubject to the revi&s;ion or correction of the legi&s;lative body. This is as unprecedented as it is dangerous. In Britain, the judicial power in the la&s;t re&s;ort, re&s;ides in the hou&s;e of lords, which is a branch of the legi&s;|lature; and this part of the Briti&s;h government has been imitated in the &s;tate con&s;titutions in general. The parliament of Great-Britain, and the legi&s;latures of the &s;everal &s;tates, can at any time rectify by law, the exceptionable deci&s;ions of their re&s;pective courts. But the errors and u&s;urpations of the &s;upreme court of the United
<PB N="312" REF="021127_0549_0FB24A4D0705D230">
States will be uncontrolable and remedile&s;s.</Q>
This, upon examination, will be found to be alto|gether made up of fal&s;e rea&s;oning upon mi&s;con|ceived fact.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, there is not a &s;yllable in the plan under con&s;ideration, which <HI>directly</HI> empowers the national courts to con&s;true the laws according to the &s;pirit of the con&s;titution, or which gives them any greater latitude in this re&s;pect, than may be claimed by the courts of every &s;tate. I admit however, that the con&s;titution ought to be the &s;tandard of con&s;truc|tion for the laws, and that wherever there is an evident oppo&s;ition, the laws ought to give place to the con&s;titution. But this doctrine is not deducible from any circum&s;tance peculiar to the plan of the convention; but from the general theory of a limited con&s;titution; and as far as it is true, is equally ap|plicable to mo&s;t, if not to all the &s;tate governments. There can be no objection therefore, on this account, to the federal judicature, which will not lie again&s;t the local judicatures in general, and which will not &s;erve to condemn every con&s;titution that attempts to &s;et bounds to the legi&s;lative di&s;cretion.</P>
<P>But perhaps the force of the objection may be thought to con&s;i&s;t in the particular organization of the propo&s;ed &s;upreme court; in its being compo&s;ed of a di&s;tinct body of magi&s;trates, in&s;tead of being one of the branches of the legi&s;lature, as in the govern|ment of Great-Britain and in that of this &s;tate. To in&s;i&s;t upon this point, the authors of the objection mu&s;t renounce the meaning they have laboured to annex to the celebrated maxim requiring a &s;eparation of the departments of power. It &s;hall neverthele&s;s be conceded to them, agreeably to the interpretation given to that maxim in the cour&s;e of the&s;e papers, that it is not violated by ve&s;ting the ultimate power of judging in a <HI>part</HI> of the legi&s;lative body. But though this be not an ab&s;olute violation of that excel|lent rule; yet it verges &s;o nearly upon it, as on this
<PB N="313" REF="021127_0550_0FB24A5065DF4448">
account alone to be le&s;s eligible than the mode preferred by the convention. From a body which had had even a partial agency in pa&s;&s;ing bad laws, we could rarely expect a di&s;po&s;ition to temper and mode|rate them in the application. The &s;ame &s;pirit, which had operated in making them, would be too apt to operate in interpreting them: Still le&s;s could it be expected, that men who had infringed the con&s;titu|tion, in the character of legi&s;lators, would be di&s;po&s;ed to repair the breach, in the character of judges. Nor is this all:&mdash;Every rea&s;on, which recommends the tenure of good behaviour for judicial offices, militates again&s;t placing the judiciary power in the la&s;t re&s;ort in a body compo&s;ed of men cho&s;en for a limited pe|riod. There is an ab&s;urdity in referring the deter|mination of cau&s;es in the fir&s;t in&s;tance to judges of permanent &s;tanding, and in the la&s;t to tho&s;e of a temporary and mutable con&s;titution. And there is a &s;till greater ab&s;urdity in &s;ubjecting the deci&s;ions of men &s;elected for their knowledge of the laws, acquired by long and laborious &s;tudy, to the revi&s;ion and control of men, who for want of the &s;ame advantage cannot but be deficient in that knowledge. The members of the legi&s;lature will rarely be cho&s;en with a view to tho&s;e qualifications which fit men for the &s;tations of judges; and as on this account there will be great rea&s;on to apprehend all the ill con&s;equences of defective information; &s;o on account of the natural propen&s;ity of &s;uch bodies to party divi&s;ions, there will be no le&s;s rea&s;on to fear, that the pe&s;tilential breath of faction may poi&s;on the fountains of ju&s;tice. The habit of being continually mar&s;halled on oppo&s;ite &s;ides, will be too apt to &s;tifle the voice both of law and of equity.</P>
<P>The&s;e con&s;iderations teach us to applaud the wi&s;dom of tho&s;e &s;tates, who have committed the judicial power in the la&s;t re&s;ort, not to a part of the legi&s;|lature, but to di&s;tinct and independent bodies of men. Contrary to the &s;uppo&s;ition of tho&s;e, who have repre&s;ented the plan of the convention in this
<PB N="314" REF="021127_0551_0FB24A512CCC52A0">
re&s;pect as novel and unprecedented, it is but a copy of the con&s;titutions of New-Hamp&s;hire, Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, Penn&s;ylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North-Carolina, South-Carolina and Georgia; and the pre|ference which has been given to the&s;e models is highly to be commended.</P>
<P>It is not true, in the &s;econd place, that the parlia|ment of Great Britain, or the legi&s;latures of the par|ticular &s;tates, can rectify the exceptionable deci&s;ions of their re&s;pective courts, in any other &s;en&s;e than might be done by a future legi&s;lature of the United States. The theory neither of the Briti&s;h, nor the &s;tate con&s;titutions, authori&s;es the revi&s;al of a judicial &s;entence, by a legi&s;lative act. Nor is there any thing in the propo&s;ed con&s;titution more than in either of them, by which it is forbidden. In the former as well as in the latter, the impropriety of the thing, on the general principles of law and rea&s;on, is the &s;ole ob&s;tacle. A legi&s;lature without exceeding its province cannot rever&s;e a determination once made, in a particular ca&s;e; though it may pre&s;cribe a new rule for future ca&s;es. This is the principle, and it applies in all its con&s;equences, exactly in the &s;ame manner and extent, to the &s;tate governments, as to the national government, now under con&s;ideration. Not the lea&s;t difference can be pointed out in any view of the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>It may in the la&s;t place be ob&s;erved that the &s;up|po&s;ed danger of judiciary encroachments on the legi&s;|lative authority, which has been upon many occa|&s;ions reiterated, is in reality a phantom. Parti|cular mi&s;con&s;tructions and contraventions of the will of the legi&s;lature may now and then happen; but they can never be &s;o exten&s;ive as to amount to an in|convenience, or in any &s;en&s;ible degree to affect the order of the political &s;y&s;tem. This may be inferred with certainty from the general nature of the judi|cial power; from the objects to which it relates; from the manner in which it is exerci&s;ed; from its com|parative
<PB N="315" REF="021127_0552_0FB24A52AE14C4A8">
weakne&s;s, and from its total incapacity to &s;upport its u&s;urpations by force. And the inference is greatly fortified by the con&s;ideration of the im|portant con&s;titutional check, which the power of in&s;tituting impeachments, in one part of the legi&s;|lative body, and of determining upon them in the other, would give to that body upon the members of the judicial department. This is alone a complete &s;ecurity. There never can be danger that the judges, by a &s;eries of deliberate u&s;urpations on the authority of the legi&s;lature, would hazard the united re&s;ent|ment of the body entru&s;ted with it, while this body was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the means of puni&s;hing their pre|&s;umption by degrading them from their &s;tations. While this ought to remove all apprehen&s;ions on the &s;ubject, it affords at the &s;ame time a cogent argu|ment for con&s;tituting the &s;enate a court for the trial of impeachments.</P>
<P>Having now examined, and I tru&s;t removed the objections to the di&s;tinct and independent organiza|tion of the &s;upreme court, I proceed to con&s;ider the propriety of the power of con&s;tituting inferior courts,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This power has been ab&s;urdly repre&s;ented as intended to aboli&s;h all the county courts in the &s;everal &s;tates, which are commonly called inferior courts. But the expre&s;&s;ions of the con&s;titution are to con&s;titute
<Q>tribunals INFERIOR TO THE SUPREME COURT,</Q>
and the evident de&s;ign of the provi&s;ion is to enable the in&s;titution of local courts &s;ubordinate to the &s;upreme, either in &s;tates or larger di&s;tricts. It is ridiculous to imagine that county courts were in contemplation.</NOTE> and the relations which will &s;ub&s;i&s;t between the&s;e and the former.</P>
<P>The power of con&s;tituting inferior courts is evi|dently calculated to obviate the nece&s;&s;ity of having recour&s;e to the &s;upreme court, in every ca&s;e of federal cognizance. It is intended to enable the national government to in&s;titute or <HI>authori&s;e</HI> in each &s;tate or di&s;trict of the United States, a tribunal competent to the determination of matters of national juri&s;dic|tion within its limits.</P>
<P><PB N="316" REF="021127_0553_0FB24A542AFB95F8">But why, it is a&s;ked, might not the &s;ame purpo&s;e have been accompli&s;hed by the in&s;trumentality of the &s;tate courts? This admits of different an&s;wers. Though the fitne&s;s and competency of tho&s;e courts &s;hould be allowed in the utmo&s;t latitude; yet the &s;ub&s;tance of the power in que&s;tion, may &s;till be regarded as a nece&s;&s;ary part of the plan, if it were only to empower the national legi&s;lature to commit to them the cognizance of cau&s;es ari&s;ing out of the national con&s;titution. To confer the power of deter|mining &s;uch cau&s;es upon the exi&s;ting courts of the &s;everal &s;tates, would perhaps be as much
<Q>to con|&s;titute tribunals,</Q>
as to create new courts with the like power. But ought not a more direct and ex|plicit provi&s;ion to have been made in favour of the &s;tate courts? There are, in my opinion, &s;ub&s;tantial rea&s;ons again&s;t &s;uch a provi&s;ion: The mo&s;t di&s;cern|ing cannot fore&s;ee how far the prevalency of a local &s;pirit may be found to di&s;qualify the local tribunals for the juri&s;diction of national cau&s;es; whil&s;t every man may di&s;cover that courts con&s;tituted like tho&s;e of &s;ome of the &s;tates, would be improper channels of the judicial authority of the union. State judges, hold|ing their offices during plea&s;ure, or from year to year, will be too little independent to be relied upon for an inflexible execution of the national laws. And if there was a nece&s;&s;ity for confiding the original cognizance of cau&s;es ari&s;ing under tho&s;e laws to them, there would be a corre&s;pondent nece&s;&s;ity for leaving the door of appeal as wide as po&s;&s;ible. In proportion to the grounds of confidence in, or dif|fidence of the &s;ubordinate tribunals, ought to be the facility or difficulty of appeals. And well &s;atisfied as I am of the propriety of the appellate juri&s;diction in the &s;everal cla&s;&s;es of cau&s;es to which it is extended by the plan of the convention, I &s;hould con&s;ider every thing calculated to give in practice, an <HI>unre|&s;trained cour&s;e</HI> to appeals as a &s;ource of public and private inconvenience.</P>
<P><PB N="317" REF="021127_0554_0FB24A563466C798">I am not &s;ure but that it will be found highly ex|pedient and u&s;eful to divide the United States into four or five, or half a dozen di&s;tricts; and to in|&s;titute a federal court in each di&s;trict, in lieu of one in every &s;tate. The judges of the&s;e courts, with the aid of the &s;tate judges, may hold circuits for the trial of cau&s;es in the &s;everal parts of the re&s;pective di&s;tricts. Ju&s;tice through them may be admini&s;tered with ea&s;e and di&s;patch; and appeals may be &s;afely circum|&s;cribed within a very narrow compa&s;s. This plan appears to me at pre&s;ent the mo&s;t eligible of any that could be adopted, and in order to it, it is nece&s;&s;ary that the power of con&s;tituting inferior courts &s;hould exi&s;t in the full extent in which it is to be found in the propo&s;ed con&s;titution.</P>
<P>The&s;e rea&s;ons &s;eem &s;ufficient to &s;atisfy a candid mind, that the want of &s;uch a power would have been a great defect in the plan. Let us now examine in what manner the judicial authority is to be di&s;tri|buted between the &s;upreme and the inferior courts of the union.</P>
<P>The &s;upreme court is to be inve&s;ted with original juri&s;diction, only
<Q>in ca&s;es affecting amba&s;&s;adors, other public mini&s;ters and con&s;uls, and tho&s;e in which A STATE &s;hall be a party.</Q>
Public mi|ni&s;ters of every cla&s;s, are the immediate repre&s;en|tatives of their &s;overeigns. All que&s;tions in which they are concerned, are &s;o directly connected with the public peace, that as well for the pre&s;ervation of this, as out of re&s;pect to the &s;overeignties they re|pre&s;ent, it is both expedient and proper, that &s;uch que&s;tions &s;hould be &s;ubmitted in the fir&s;t in&s;tance to the highe&s;t judicatory of the nation. Though con&s;uls have not in &s;trictne&s;s a diplomatic character, yet as they are the public agents of the nations to which they belong, the &s;ame ob&s;ervation is in a great mea&s;ure applicable to them. In ca&s;es in which a &s;tate might happen to be a party, it would ill &s;uit its dignity to be turned over to an inferior tribunal.</P>
<P><PB N="318" REF="021127_0555_0FB24A5B45E2F540">Though it may rather be a digre&s;&s;ion from the immediate &s;ubject of this paper, I &s;hall take occa&s;ion to mention here, a &s;uppo&s;ition which has excited &s;ome alarm upon very mi&s;taken grounds: It has been &s;ugge&s;ted that an a&s;&s;ignment of the public &s;ecurities of one &s;tate to the citizens of another, would enable them to pro&s;ecute that &s;tate in the federal courts for the amount of tho&s;e &s;ecurities. A &s;ugge&s;tion which the following con&s;iderations prove to be without foundation.</P>
<P>It is inherent in the nature of &s;overeignty, not to be amenable to the &s;uit of an individual <HI>without its con&s;ent.</HI> This is the general &s;en&s;e and the general practice of mankind; and the exemption, as one of the attributes of &s;overeignty, is now enjoyed by the government of every &s;tate in the union. Unle&s;s therefore, there is a &s;urrender of this immunity in the plan of the convention, it will remain with the &s;tates, and the danger intimated mu&s;t be merely ideal. The circum&s;tances which are nece&s;&s;ary to produce an alienation of &s;tate &s;overeignty, were di&s;cu&s;&s;ed in con|&s;idering the article of taxation, and need not be repeated here. A recurrence to the principles there e&s;tabli&s;hed will &s;atisfy us, that there is no colour to pretend that the &s;tate governments, would by the adoption of that plan, be dive&s;ted of the privilege of paying their own debts in their own way, free from every con&s;traint but that which flows from the obli|gations of good faith. The contracts between a na|tion and individuals are only binding on the con|&s;cience of the &s;overeign, and have no preten&s;ions to a compul&s;ive force. They confer no right of action independent of the &s;overeign will. To what purpo&s;e would it be to authori&s;e &s;uits again&s;t &s;tates, for the debts they owe? How could recoveries be enforced? It is evident that it could not be done without waging war again&s;t the contracting &s;tate; and to a&s;cribe to the federal courts, by mere implication, and in de|&s;truction of a pre-exi&s;ting right of the &s;tate govern|ments,
<PB N="319" REF="021127_0556_0FB24A5F373C9C18">
a power which would involve &s;uch a con|&s;equence, would be altogether forced and un|warrantable.</P>
<P>Let us re&s;ume the train of our ob&s;ervations; we have &s;een that the original juri&s;diction of the &s;upreme court would be confined to two cla&s;&s;es of cau&s;es, and tho&s;e of a nature rarely to occur. In all other cau&s;es of federal cognizance, the original juri&s;diction would appertain to the inferior tribunals, and the &s;upreme court would have nothing more than an appellate juri&s;diction,
<Q>with &s;uch <HI>exceptions,</HI> and under &s;uch <HI>regulations</HI> as the congre&s;s &s;hall make.</Q></P>
<P>The propriety of this appellate juri&s;diction has been &s;carcely called in que&s;tion in regard to matters of law; but the clamours have been loud again&s;t it as applied to matters of fact. Some well intentioned men in this &s;tate, deriving their notions from the language and forms which obtain in our courts, have been induced to con&s;ider it as an implied &s;uper|&s;edure of the trial by jury, in favour of the civil law mode of trial, which prevails in our courts of admi|rality, probates and chancery. A technical &s;en&s;e has been affixed to the term "appellate", which in our law parlance is commonly u&s;ed in reference to appeals in the cour&s;e of the civil law. But if I am not mi&s;informed, the &s;ame meaning would not be given to it in any part of New-England. There an appeal from one jury to another is familiar both in language and practice, and is even a matter of cour&s;e, until there have been two verdicts on one &s;ide. The word "appellate" therefore will not be under&s;tood in the &s;ame &s;en&s;e in New-England as in New-York, which &s;hews the impropriety of a technical interpretation derived from the juri&s;prudence of any particular &s;tate. The expre&s;&s;ion taken in the ab&s;tract, denotes nothing more than the power of one tribunal to review the proceedings of another, either as to the law or fact, or both. The mode of doing it may depend on ancient cu&s;tom or legi&s;lative provi&s;ion, (in a new
<PB N="320" REF="021127_0557_0FB24A60F1BDFE58">
government it mu&s;t depend on the latter) and may be with or without the aid of a jury, as may be judged advi&s;eable. If therefore the re-examination of a fact, once determined by a jury, &s;hould in any ca&s;e be admitted under the propo&s;ed con&s;titution, it may be &s;o regulated as to be done by a &s;econd jury, either by remanding the cau&s;e to the court below for a &s;econd trial of the fact, or by directing an i&s;&s;ue immediately out of the &s;upreme court.</P>
<P>But it does not follow that the re-examination of a fact once a&s;certained by a jury, will be permitted in the &s;upreme court. Why may it not be &s;aid, with the &s;tricte&s;t propriety, when a writ of error is brought from an inferior to a &s;uperior court of law in this &s;tate, that the latter has juri&s;diction of the fact, as well as the law? It is true it cannot in&s;titute a new enquiry concerning the fact, but it takes cognizance of it as it appears upon the record, and pronounces the law ari&s;ing upon it.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This word is a compound of JUS and DICTIO, juris, dictio, or a &s;peaking or pronouncing of the law.</NOTE> This is juri&s;diction of both fact and law, nor is it even po&s;&s;ible to &s;eparate them. Though the common law courts of this &s;tate a&s;certain di&s;puted facts by a jury, yet they unque&s;|tionably have juri&s;diction of both fact and law; and accordingly, when the former is agreed in the pleadings, they have no recour&s;e to a jury, but proceed at once to judgment. I contend therefore on this ground, that the expre&s;&s;ions,
<Q>appellate juri&s;diction, both as to law and fact,</Q>
do not ne|ce&s;&s;arily imply a re-examination in the &s;upreme court of facts decided by juries in the inferior courts.</P>
<P>The following train of ideas may well be imagined to have influenced the convention in relation to this particular provi&s;ion. The appellate juri&s;diction of the &s;upreme court (may it have been argued) will extend to cau&s;es determinable in different modes, &s;ome in the cour&s;e of the COMMON LAW, and others in the cour&s;e of the CIVIL LAW. In the former,
<PB N="321" REF="021127_0558_0FB24A627021DE70">
the revi&s;ion of the law only, will be, generally &s;peaking, the proper province of the &s;upreme court; in the latter, the re-examination of the fact is agreeable to u&s;age, and in &s;ome ca&s;es, of which prize cau&s;es are an example, might be e&s;&s;ential to the pre&s;ervation of the public peace. It is therefore nece&s;&s;ary, that the appellate juri&s;diction &s;hould, in certain ca&s;es, extend in the broade&s;t &s;en&s;e to matters of fact. It will not an&s;wer to make an expre&s;s ex|ception of ca&s;es, which &s;hall have been originally tried by a jury, becau&s;e in the courts of &s;ome of the &s;tates, <HI>all cau&s;es</HI> are tried in this mode;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I hold that the &s;tates will have concurrent juri&s;diction with the &s;ubordinate federal judicatories, in many ca&s;es of federal cognizance, as will be explained in my next paper.</NOTE> and &s;uch an exception would preclude the revi&s;ion of matters of fact, as well where it might be proper, as where it might be improper. To avoid all inconveniencies, it will be &s;afe&s;t to declare generally, that the &s;upreme court &s;hall po&s;&s;e&s;s appellate juri&s;diction, both as to law and <HI>fact,</HI> and that this juri&s;diction &s;hall be &s;ubject to &s;uch <HI>exceptions</HI> and regulations as the national legi&s;lature may pre&s;cribe. This will en|able the government to modify it in &s;uch a manner as will be&s;t an&s;wer the ends of public ju&s;tice and &s;ecurity.</P>
<P>This view of the matter, at any rate puts it out of all doubt that the &s;uppo&s;ed <HI>abolition</HI> of the trial by jury, by the operation of this provi&s;ion, is, fallacious and untrue. The legi&s;lature of the United States would certainly have full power to provide that in appeals to the &s;upreme court there &s;hould be no re-examination of facts where they had been tried in the original cau&s;es by juries. This would certainly be an autho|ri&s;ed exception; but if for the rea&s;on already inti|mated it &s;hould be thought too exten&s;ive, it might be qualified with a limitation to &s;uch cau&s;es only as are determinable at common law in that mode of trial.</P>

<HEAD>NUMBER LXXXII. A further View of the Judicial Depart|ment, in reference to &s;ome mi&s;cellaneous Que&s;tions.</HEAD>
<P>THE erection of a new government, whatever care or wi&s;dom may di&s;tingui&s;h the work, can|not fail to originate que&s;tions of intricacy and nicety; and the&s;e may in a particular manner be expected to flow from the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a con&s;titution founded upon the total or partial incorporation of a number of di&s;tinct &s;overeignties. 'Tis time only that can mature and perfect &s;o compound a &s;y&s;tem, can liquidate the meaning of all the parts, and can adju&s;t them to each other in a harmonious and con&s;i&s;tent WHOLE.</P>
<P><PB N="323" REF="021127_0560_0FB24A656A6F1150">Such que&s;tions accordingly have ari&s;en upon the plan propo&s;ed by the convention&punc; and particularly concerning the judiciary department. The principal of the&s;e re&s;pect the &s;ituation of the &s;tate courts in regard to tho&s;e cau&s;es, which are to be &s;ubmitted to federal juri&s;diction. Is this to be exclu&s;ive, or are tho&s;e courts to po&s;&s;e&s;s a concurrent juri&s;diction? If the latter, in what relation will they &s;tand to the national tribunals? The&s;e are inquiries which we meet with in the mouths of men of &s;en&s;e, and which are certainly intitled to attention.</P>
<P>The principles e&s;tabli&s;hed in a former paper<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vol. 1. No. XXXII.</NOTE> teach us, that the &s;tates will retain all <HI>pre-exi&s;ting</HI> authorities, which may not be exclu&s;ively delegated to the federal head; and that this exclu&s;ive delegation can only exi&s;t in one of three ca&s;es; where an exclu&s;ive autho|rity is in expre&s;s terms granted to the union; or where a particular authority is granted to the union, and the exerci&s;e of a like authority is prohibited to the &s;tates, or where an authority is granted to the union with which a &s;imilar authority in the &s;tates would be utterly incompatible. Though the&s;e prin|ciples may not apply with the &s;ame force to the judiciary as to the legi&s;lative power; yet I am inclined to think that they are in the main ju&s;t with re&s;pect to the former as well as the latter. And under this impre&s;&s;ion I &s;hall lay it down as a rule that the &s;tate courts will <HI>retain</HI> the juri&s;diction they now have, unle&s;s it appears to be taken away in one of the enumerated modes.</P>
<P>They only thing in the propo&s;ed con&s;titution, which wears the appearance of confining the cau&s;es of federal cognizance to the federal courts is contained in this pa&s;&s;age&mdash;
<Q>The JUDICIAL POWER of the United States <HI>&s;hall be ve&s;ted</HI> in one &s;upreme court, and in <HI>&s;uch</HI> inferior courts as the congre&s;s &s;hall from time to time ordain and e&s;tabli&s;h</Q>
&mdash;This might either be con&s;trued to &s;ignify, that the &s;upreme and
<PB N="324" REF="021127_0561_0FB24A677347F9B8">
&s;ubordinate courts of the union &s;hould alone have the power of deciding tho&s;e cau&s;es, to which their autho|rity is to extend; or &s;imply to denote that the organs of the national judiciary &s;hould be one &s;upreme court and as many &s;ubordinate courts as congre&s;s &s;hould think proper to appoint, or in other words, that the United States &s;hould exerci&s;e the judicial power with which they are to be inve&s;ted through one &s;upreme tribunal and a certain, number of inferior ones to be in&s;tituted by them. The fir&s;t excludes, the la&s;t admits the concurrent juri&s;diction of the &s;tate tribunals: And as the fir&s;t would amount to an alienation of &s;tate power by implication, the la&s;t appears to me the mo&s;t natural and the mo&s;t defen&s;ible con&s;truction.</P>
<P>But this doctrine of concurrent juri&s;diction is only clearly applicable to tho&s;e de&s;criptions of cau&s;es of which the &s;tate courts have previous cognizance. It is not equally evident in relation to ca&s;es which may grow out of, and be <HI>peculiar</HI> to the con&s;titution to be e&s;tabli&s;hed: For not to allow the &s;tate courts a right of juri&s;diction in &s;uch ca&s;es can hardly be con&s;idered as the abridgement of a pre-exi&s;ting authority. I mean not therefore to contend that the United States in the cour&s;e of legi&s;lation upon the objects entru&s;ted to their direction may not commit the deci&s;ion of cau&s;es ari&s;ing upon a particular regulation to the federal courts &s;olely, if &s;uch a mea&s;ure &s;hould be deemed expedient; but I hold that the &s;tate courts will be dive&s;ted of no part of their primitive juri&s;|diction, further than may relate to an appeal; and I am even of opinion, that in every ca&s;e in which they were not expre&s;sly excluded by the future acts of the national legi&s;lature, they will of cour&s;e take cognizance of the cau&s;es to which tho&s;e acts may give birth. This I infer from the nature of judi|ciary power, and from the general genius of the &s;y&s;tem. The judiciary power of every government looks beyond its own local or municipal laws, and in
<PB N="325" REF="021127_0562_0FB24A692C4705A0">
civil ca&s;es lays hold of all &s;ubjects of litigation between parties within its juri&s;diction though the cau&s;es of di&s;pute are relative to the laws of the mo&s;t di&s;tant part of the globe. Tho&s;e of Japan not le&s;s than of New-York may furni&s;h the objects of legal di&s;cu&s;&s;ion to our courts. When in addition to this, we con&s;ider the &s;tate governments and the na|tional governments as they truly are, in the light of kindred &s;y&s;tems and as parts of ONE WHOLE, the inference&punc; &s;eems to be conclu&s;ive that the &s;tate courts would have a concurrent juri&s;diction in all ca&s;es ari&s;ing under the laws of the union, where it was not expre&s;sly prohibited.</P>
<P>Here another que&s;tion occurs&mdash;what relation would &s;ub&s;i&s;t between the national and &s;tate courts in the&s;e in&s;tances of concurrent juri&s;diction? I an&s;wer that an appeal would certainly lie from the latter to the &s;upreme court of the United States. The con&s;titution in direct terms, gives an appellate juri&s;diction to the &s;upreme court in all the enumerated ca&s;es of federal cognizance, in which it is not to have an original one; without a &s;ingle expre&s;&s;ion to confine its opera|tion to the inferior federal courts. The objects of appeal, not the tribunals from which it is to be made, are alone contemplated. From this circum&s;tance and from the rea&s;on of the thing it ought to be con&s;trued to extend to the &s;tate tribunals. Either this mu&s;t be the ca&s;e, or the local courts mu&s;t be excluded from a concurrent juri&s;diction in matters of national con|cern, el&s;e the judiciary authority of the union may be eluded at the plea&s;ure of every plantiff or pro&s;e|cutor. Neither of the&s;e con&s;equences ought without evident nece&s;&s;ity to be involved; the latter would be intirely inadmi&s;&s;ible, as it would defeat &s;ome of the mo&s;t important and avowed purpo&s;es of the propo&s;ed government, and would e&s;&s;entially embarra&s;s its mea|&s;ures. Nor do I perceive any foundation for &s;uch a &s;up|po&s;ition. Agreeably to the remark already made, the national and &s;tate &s;y&s;tems are to be regarded as ONE WHOLE. The courts of the latter will of cour&s;e be
<PB N="326" REF="021127_0563_0FB24A6FDA54A578">
natural auxiliaries to the execution of the laws of the union, and an appeal from them will as naturally lie to that tribunal, which is de&s;tined to uni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters">d a&s;&s;i|milate the principles of national ju&s;tice and the rules of national deci&s;ions. The evident aim of the plan of the convention is that all the cau&s;es of the &s;pe|cified cla&s;&s;es, &s;hall for weighty public rea&s;ons receive their original or final determination in the courts of the union. To confine therefore the general expre&s;|&s;ions giving appellate juri&s;diction to the &s;upreme court to appeals from the &s;ubordinate federal courts, in&s;tead of allowing their exten&s;ion to the &s;tate courts, would be to abridge the latitude of the terms, in &s;ub|ver&s;ion of the intent, contrary to every &s;ound rule of interpretation.</P>
<P>But could an appeal be made to lie from the &s;tate courts to the &s;ubordinate federal judicatories? This is another of the que&s;tions which have been rai&s;ed, and of greater difficulty than the former. The follow|ing con&s;iderations countenance the affirmative. The plan of the convention in the fir&s;t place authori&s;es the national legi&s;lature
<Q>to con&s;titute tribunals infe|rior to the &s;upreme court<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Section 8th. Article 1&s;t.</NOTE></Q>
It declares in the next place that,
<Q>the JUDICIAL POWER of the United States <HI>&s;hall be ve&s;ted</HI> in one &s;upreme court and in &s;uch inferior courts as congre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s &s;hall ordain and e&s;tabli&s;h;</Q>
and it then proceeds to enumerate the ca&s;es to which this judicial power &s;hall extend. It afterwards divides the juri&s;diction of the &s;upreme court into original and appellate, but gives no defi|nition of that of the &s;ubordinate courts. The only outlines de&s;cribed for them are that they &s;hall be "inferior to the &s;upreme court" and that they &s;hall not exceed the &s;pecified limits of the federal judiciary. Whether their authority &s;hall be original or appellate or both is not declared. All this &s;eems to be left to the di&s;cretion of the legi&s;lature. And this being the ca&s;e, I perceive at pre&s;ent no impediment to the e&s;tabli&s;hment of an appeal from the &s;tate courts
<PB N="327" REF="021127_0564_0FB24A750B8EF430">
to the &s;ubordinate national tribunals; and many advantages attending the power of doing it may be imagi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">. It would dimini&s;h the motives to the multiplication of federal courts, and would admit of arrangements calculated to contract the appellate juri&s;diction of the &s;upreme court.

<P>With regard to civil cau&s;es, &s;ubtleties almo&s;t too contemptible for refutation, have been adopted to countenance the &s;urmi&s;e that a thing, which is only <HI>not provided for,</HI> is entirely <HI>aboli&s;hed.</HI> Every man of di&s;cernment mu&s;t at once perceive the wide dif|ference between <HI>&s;ilence</HI> and <HI>abolition.</HI> But as the inventors of this fallacy have attempted to &s;upport it by certain <HI>legal maxims</HI> of interpretation, which they have perverted from their true meaning, it may not be wholly u&s;ele&s;s to explore the ground they have taken.</P>
<P>The maxim<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> on which they rely are of this nature,
<Q>a &s;pecification of particulars is an exclu&s;ion of generals;</Q>
or,
<Q>the expre&s;&s;ion of one thing is the exclu&s;ion of another.</Q>
Hence, &s;ay they, as the con&s;titution has e&s;tabli&s;hed the trial by jury in criminal ca&s;es, and is &s;ilent in re&s;pect to civil, this &s;ilence is an implied prohibition of trial by jury in regard to the latter.</P>
<P>The rules of legal interpretation are rules of <HI>common &s;en&s;e,</HI> adopted by the courts in the con&s;truc|tion of the laws. The true te&s;t therefore, of a ju&s;t application of them, in its conformity to the &s;ource from which they are derived. This being the ca&s;e, let me a&s;k if it is con&s;i&s;tent with rea&s;on or common &s;en&s;e to &s;uppo&s;e, that a provi&s;ion obliging the legi&s;|lative power to commit the trial of criminal cau&s;es to juries, is a privation of its right to authori&s;e or permit that mode of trial in other ca&s;es? Is it na|tural to &s;uppo&s;e, that a command to do one thing, is a prohibition to the doing of another, which there was a previous power to do, and which is not in|compatible with the thing commanded to be done? If &s;uch a &s;uppo&s;ition would be unnatural and unrea|&s;onable, it cannot be rational to maintain that an injunction of the trial by jury in certain ca&s;es is an interdiction of it in others.</P>
<P><PB N="329" REF="021127_0566_0FB24A78291D9E98">A power to con&s;titute courts, is a power to pre&s;cribe the mode of trial; and con&s;equently, if nothing was &s;aid in the con&s;titution on the &s;ubject of juries, the legi&s;lature would be at liberty either to adopt that in&s;titution, or to let it alone. This di&s;cretion in regard to criminal cau&s;es is abridged by the expre&s;s injunction of trial by jury in all &s;uch ca&s;es; but it is of cour&s;e left at large in relation to civil cau&s;es, there being a total &s;ilence on this head. The &s;pecification of an obligation to try all criminal cau&s;es in a par|ticular mode, excludes indeed the obligation or nece&s;&s;ity of employing the &s;ame mode in civil cau&s;es, but does not abridge <HI>the power</HI> of the legi&s;lature to exerci&s;e that mode if it &s;hould be thought prop<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r. The pretence therefore, that the national legi&s;lature would not be at full liberty to &s;ubmit all the civil cau&s;es of federal cognizance to the determination of juries, is a pretence de&s;titute of all ju&s;t foundation.</P>
<P>From the&s;e ob&s;ervations, this conclu&s;ion re&s;ults, that the trial by jury in civil ca&s;es would not be aboli&s;hed, and that the u&s;e attempted to be made of the maxims which have been quoted, is contrary to rea&s;on and common &s;en&s;e, and therefore not admi&s;|&s;ible. Even if the&s;e maxims had a preci&s;e technical &s;en&s;e, corre&s;ponding with the ideas of tho&s;e who employ them upon the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, which, how|ever, is not the ca&s;e, they would &s;till be inapplicable to a con&s;titution of government. In relation to &s;uch a &s;ubject, the natural and obvious &s;en&s;e of its pro|vi&s;ions, apart from any technical rules, is the true criterion of con&s;truction.</P>
<P>Having now &s;een that the maxims relied upon will not bear the u&s;e made of them, let us endeavour to a&s;certain their proper u&s;e and true meaning. This will be be&s;t done by examples. The plan of the convention declares that the power of congre&s;s or in other words of the <HI>national legi&s;lature,</HI> &s;hall extend to certain enumerated ca&s;es. This &s;pecification of par|ticulars evidently excludes all preten&s;ion to a general
<PB N="330" REF="021127_0567_0FB24A7A2B9D5050">
legi&s;lative authority; becau&s;e an affirmative grant of &s;pecial powers would be ab&s;urd as well as u&s;ele&s;s, if a general authority was intended.</P>
<P>In like manner, the judicial authority of the federal judicatures, is declared by the con&s;titution to com|prehend certain ca&s;es particularly &s;pecified. The expre&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e ca&s;es marks the preci&s;e limits beyond which the federal courts cannot extend their juri&s;diction; becau&s;e the objects of their cognizance being enumerated, the &s;pecification would be nuga|tory if it did not exclude all ideas of more exten|&s;ive authority.</P>
<P>The&s;e examples might be &s;ufficient to elucidate the maxims which have been mentioned, and de&s;ignate the manner in which they &s;hould be u&s;ed. But that there may be no po&s;&s;ibility of mi&s;apprehen&s;ion upon this &s;ubject I &s;hall add one ca&s;e more, to demon&s;trate the proper u&s;e of the&s;e maxims, and the abu&s;e which has been made of them.</P>
<P>Let us &s;uppo&s;e that by the laws of this &s;tate, a married woman was incapable of conveying her e&s;tate, and that the legi&s;lature, con&s;idering this as an evil, &s;hould enact that &s;he might di&s;po&s;e of her property by deed executed in the pre&s;ence of a magi|&s;trate. In &s;uch a ca&s;e there can be no doubt but the &s;pecification would amount to an exclu&s;ion of any other mode of conveyance; becau&s;e the woman having no previous power to alienate her property, the &s;pecification determines the particular mode which &s;he is, for that purpo&s;e, to avail her&s;elf of. But let us further &s;uppo&s;e that in a &s;ub&s;equent part of the &s;ame act it &s;hould be declared that no woman &s;hould di&s;po&s;e of any e&s;tate of a determinate value without the con&s;ent of three of her neare&s;t relations, &s;ignified by their &s;igning the deed; could it be inferred from this regulation that a married woman might not procure the approbation of her relations to a deed for conveying property of inferior value? The po&s;ition is too ab&s;urd to merit a refutation, and yet this is
<PB N="331" REF="021127_0568_0FB24A7B25BF6808">
preci&s;ely the po&s;ition which tho&s;e mu&s;t e&s;tabli&s;h who contend that the trial by juries, in civil ca&s;es, is aboli&s;hed, becau&s;e it is expre&s;sly provided for in ca&s;es of a criminal nature.</P>
<P>From the&s;e ob&s;ervations it mu&s;t appear unque&s;ti|onably true that trial by jury is in no ca&s;e aboli&s;hed by the propo&s;ed con&s;titution, and it is equally true that in tho&s;e controver&s;ies between individuals in which the great body of the people are likely to be intere&s;ted, that in&s;titution will remain preci&s;ely in the &s;ame &s;ituation in which it is placed by the &s;tate con&s;titutions, and will be in no degree altered or influenced by the adoption of the plan under con&s;i|deration. The foundation of this a&s;&s;ertion is that the national judiciary will have no cognizance of them, and of cour&s;e they will remain determinable as heretofore by the &s;tate courts only, and in the manner which the &s;tate con&s;titutions and laws pre|&s;cribe. All land cau&s;es, except where claims under the grants of different &s;tates come into que&s;tion, and all other controver&s;ies between the citizens of the &s;ame &s;tate, unle&s;s where they depend upon po&s;itive violations of the articles of union by acts of the &s;tate legi&s;latures, will belong exclu&s;ively to the juri&s;diction of the &s;tate tribunals. Add to this that admiralty cau&s;es, and almo&s;t all tho&s;e which are of equity juri&s;diction are determinable under our own govern|ment without the intervention of a jury, and the inference from the whole will be that this in&s;titution, as it exi&s;ts with us at pre&s;ent, cannot po&s;&s;ibly be affected to any great extent by the propo&s;ed alter|ation in our &s;y&s;tem of government.</P>
<P>The friends and adver&s;aries of the plan of the con|vention, if they agree in nothing el&s;e, concur a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> lea&s;t in the value they &s;et upon the trial by jury: Or if there is any difference between them, it con&s;i&s;ts in this; the former regard it as a valuable &s;afeguard to liberty, the latter repre&s;ent it as the very palladium of free government. For my own part, the more
<PB N="332" REF="021127_0569_0FB24A86ED936F48">
the operation of the in&s;titution has fallen under my ob&s;ervation, the more rea&s;on I have di&s;covered for holding it in high e&s;timation; and it would be alto|gether &s;uperfluous to examine to what extent it de&s;erve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to be e&s;teemed u&s;eful or e&s;&s;ential in a repre&s;entative republic, or how much more merit it may be entitled to as a defence again&s;t the oppre&s;&s;ions of an heredi|tary monarch, than as a barrier to the tyranny of popular magi&s;trates in a popular government. Di&s;|cu&s;&s;ions of this kind would be more curious than beneficial, as all are &s;atisfied of the utility of the in&s;titution, and of its friendly a&s;pect to liberty. But I mu&s;t acknowledge that I cannot readily di&s;cern the in&s;eparable connection between the exi&s;tence of liberty and the trial by jury in civil ca&s;es. Arbi|trary impeachments, arbitrary methods of pro&s;e|cuting pretended offences, and arbitrary puni&s;hments upon arbitrary convictions have ever appeared to me to be the great engines of judicial de&s;poti&s;m; and the&s;e have all relation to criminal proceedings. The trial by jury in criminal ca&s;es, aided by the <HI>habeas corpus</HI> act, &s;eems therefore to be alone con|cerned in the que&s;tion. And both of the&s;e are pro|vided for in the mo&s;t ample manner in the plan of the convention.</P>
<P>It has been ob&s;erved, that trial by jury is a &s;afe|guard again&s;t an oppre&s;&s;ive exerci&s;e of the power of taxation. This ob&s;ervation de&s;erves to be canva&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>It is evident that it can have no influence upon the legi&s;lature, in regard to the <HI>amount</HI> of the taxes to be laid, to the <HI>objects</HI> upon which they are to be impo&s;ed, or to the <HI>rule</HI> by which they are to be apportioned. If it can have any influence therefore, it mu&s;t be upon the mode of collection, and the con|duct of the officers entru&s;ted with the execution of the revenue laws.</P>
<P>As to the mode of collection in this &s;tate, under our own con&s;titution, the trial by jury is in mo&s;t ca&s;es out of u&s;e. The taxes are u&s;ually levied by the
<PB N="333" REF="021127_0570_0FB24A892C965268">
more &s;ummary proceeding of di&s;tre&s;s and &s;ale, as in ca&s;es of rent. And it is acknowledged on all hands, that this is e&s;&s;ential to the efficacy of the revenue laws. The dilatory cour&s;e of a trial at law to re|cover the taxes impo&s;ed on individuals, would neither &s;uit the exigencies of the public, nor promote the convenience of the citizens. It would often occa|&s;ion an accumulation of co&s;ts, more burthen&s;ome than the original &s;um of the tax to be levied.</P>
<P>And as to the conduct of the officers of the revenue, the provi&s;ion in favor of trial by jury in criminal ca&s;es, will afford the &s;ecurity aimed at. Wilful abu&s;es of a public authority, to the oppre&s;&s;ion of the &s;ubject, and every &s;pecies of official extortion, are offences again&s;t the government; for which, the per&s;ons who commit them, may be indicted and puni&s;hed according to the circum&s;tances of the ca&s;e.</P>
<P>The excellence of the trial by jury in civil ca&s;es, appears to depend on circum&s;tances foreign to the pre&s;ervation of liberty. The &s;tronge&s;t argument in its favour is, that it is a &s;ecurity again&s;t corruption. As there is always more time and better opportunity to tamper with a &s;tanding body of magi&s;trates than with a jury &s;ummoned for the occa&s;ion, there is room to &s;uppo&s;e, that a corrupt influence would more ea&s;ily find its way to the former than to the latter. The force of this con&s;ideration, is however, dimini&s;hed by others. The &s;heriff who is the &s;ummoner of ordinary juries, and the clerks of courts who have the nomina|tion of &s;pecial juries, are them&s;elves &s;tanding officers, and acting individually, may be &s;uppo&s;ed more acce&s;|&s;ible to the touch of corruption than the judges, who are a collective body. It is not difficult to &s;ee that it would be in the power of tho&s;e officers to &s;elect jurors who would &s;erve the purpo&s;e of the party as well as a corrupted bench. In the next place, it may fairly be &s;uppo&s;ed that there would be le&s;s difficulty in gaining &s;ome of the jurors promi&s;cuou&s;ly taken from the public ma&s;s, than in gaining men who had been cho&s;en by
<PB N="334" REF="021127_0571_0FB24A8A46FF5608">
the government for their probity and good character. But making every deduction for the&s;e con&s;iderations the trial by jury mu&s;t &s;till be a valuable check upon corruption. It greatly multiplies the impediments to its &s;ucce&s;s. As matters now &s;tand, it would be nece&s;&s;ary to corrupt both court and jury; for where the jury have gone evidently wrong, the court will generally grant a new trial, and it would be in mo&s;t ca&s;es of little u&s;e to practice upon the jury, unle&s;s the court could be likewi&s;e gained. Here then is a double &s;ecurity; and it will readily be perceived that this complicated agency tends to pre&s;erve the purity of both in&s;titutions. By increa&s;ing the ob&s;tacles to &s;ucce&s;s, it di&s;courages attempts to &s;educe the integrity of either. The temptations to pro&s;titution, which the judges might have to &s;urmount, mu&s;t certainly be much fewer while the co-operation of a jury is ne|ce&s;&s;ary, than they might be if they had them&s;elves the exclu&s;ive determination of all cau&s;es.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding therefore the doubts I have ex|pre&s;&s;ed as to the e&s;&s;entiality of trial by jury, in civil ca&s;es, to liberty, I admit that it is in mo&s;t ca&s;es, under proper regulations, an excellent method of de|termining que&s;tions of property; and that on this account alone it would be entitled to a con&s;titutional provi&s;ion in its favour, if it were po&s;&s;ible to fix the limits within which it ought to be comprehended. There is however, in all ca&s;es, great difficulty in this; and men not blinded by enthu&s;ia&s;m, mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible that in a federal government which is a compo&s;ition of &s;ocieties who&s;e ideas and in&s;titutions in relation to the matter materially vary from each other, that dif|ficulty mu&s;t be not a little augmented. For my own part, at every new view I take of the &s;ubject, I be|come more convinced of the reality of the ob&s;tacles, which we are authoritatively informed, prevented the in&s;ertion of a provi&s;ion on this head in the plan of the convention.</P>
<P><PB N="335" REF="021127_0572_0FB24A8BA8A303E0">The great difference between the limits of the jury trial in different &s;tates is not generally under&s;tood. And as it mu&s;t have con&s;iderable influence on the &s;entence we ought to pa&s;s upon the omi&s;&s;ion com|plained of, in regard to this point, an explanation of it is nece&s;&s;ary. In this &s;tate our judicial e&s;tabli&s;h|ments re&s;emble more nearly, than in any other, tho&s;e of Great-Britain. We have courts of common law, courts of probates (analogous in certain matters to the &s;piritual courts in England) a court of admiralty, and a court of chancery. In the courts of common law only the trial by jury prevails, and this with &s;ome exceptions In all the others a &s;ingle judge pre&s;ides and proceeds in general either according to the cour&s;e of the cannon or civil law, without the aid of a jury.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It has been erroneou&s;ly in&s;inuated, with regard to the court of chancery, that this court generally tries di&s;puted facts by a jury. The truth is, that references to a jury in that court rarely happen, and are in no ca&s;e nece&s;&s;ary, but where the vali|dity of a devi&s;e of land comes into que&s;tion.</NOTE> In New-Jer&s;ey there is a court of chancery which proceeds like ours, but neither courts of admiralty, nor of probates, in the &s;en&s;e in which the&s;e la&s;t are e&s;tabli&s;hed with us. In that &s;tate the courts of com|mon law have the cognizance of tho&s;e cau&s;es, which with us are determinate in the courts of admiralty and of probates, and of cour&s;e the jury trial is more exten&s;ive in New-Jer&s;ey than in New-York. In Penn&s;ylvania this is perhaps &s;till more the ca&s;e, for there is no court of chancery in that &s;tate, and its common law courts have equity juri&s;diction. It has a court of admiralty, but none of probates, at lea&s;t on the plan of ours. Delaware has in the&s;e re&s;pects imitated Penn&s;ylvania. Maryland approaches more nearly to New-York, as does al&s;o Virginia, except that the latter has a plurality of chancellors. North-Carolina bears mo&s;t affinity to Penn&s;ylvania; South-Carolina to Virginia. I believe however that in &s;ome of tho&s;e &s;tates which have di&s;tinct courts of admiralty, the cau&s;es depending in them are triable by juries.
<PB N="336" REF="021127_0573_0FB24A8DAE680140">
In Georgia there are none but common law courts, and an appeal of cour&s;e lies from the verdict of one jury to another, which is called a &s;pecial jury, and for which a particular mode of appointment is marked out. In Connecticut they have no di&s;tinct courts, either of chancery or of admiralty, and their courts of probates have no juri&s;diction of cau&s;es. Their common law courts have admiralty, and to a certain extent, equity juri&s;diction. In ca&s;es of im|portance their general a&s;&s;embly is the only court of chancery. In Connecticut therefore the trial by jury extends in <HI>practice</HI> further than in any other &s;tate yet mentioned. Rhode I&s;land is I believe in this parti|cular pretty much in the &s;ituation of Connecticut. Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts and New-Hamp&s;hire, in regard to the blending of law, equity and admiralty, juri&s;dictions are in a &s;imiliar predicament. In the four ea&s;tern &s;tates the trial by jury not only &s;tands upon a broader foun|dation than in the other &s;tates, but it is attended with a peculiarity unknown in its full extent to any of them. There is an appeal <HI>of cour&s;e</HI> from one jury to another till there have been two verdicts out of three on one &s;ide.</P>
<P>From this &s;ketch it appears, that there is a mate|rial diver&s;ity as well in the modification as in the ex|tent of the in&s;titution of trial by jury in civil ca&s;es in the &s;everal &s;tates; and from this fact, the&s;e obvi|ous reflections flow. Fir&s;t, that no general rule could have been fixed upon by the convention which would have corre&s;ponded with the circum&s;tances of all the &s;tates; and &s;econdly, that more, or at lea&s;t as much might have been hazarded, by taking the &s;y&s;tem of any one &s;tate for a &s;tandard, as by omitting a provi|&s;ion altogether, and leaving the matter as it has been left, to legi&s;lative regulation.</P>
<P>The propo&s;itions which have been made for &s;upply|ing the omi&s;&s;ion, have rather &s;erved to illu&s;trate than to obviate the difficulty of the thing. The minority of Penn&s;ylvania have propo&s;ed this mode of expre&s;&s;ion
<PB N="337" REF="021127_0574_0FB24A8EA5FCD2B0">
for the purpo&s;e&mdash;
<Q>trial by jury &s;hall be as here|tofore</Q>
&mdash;and this I maintain would be ab&s;olutely &s;en&s;ele&s;s and nugatory. The United States, in their united or collective capacity, are the OBJECT to which all general provi&s;ions in the con&s;titution mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be con&s;trued to refer. Now it is evident, that though trial by jury with various limitations is known in each &s;tate individually, yet in the United States <HI>as &s;uch,</HI> it is at this time altogether unknown, becau&s;e the pre&s;ent federal government has no judi|ciary power whatever; and con&s;equently there is no proper antecedent or previous e&s;tabli&s;hment to which the term <HI>heretofore</HI> could relate. It would therefore be de&s;titute of a preci&s;e meaning, and inoperative from its uncertainty.</P>
<P>As on the one hand, the form of the provi&s;ion would not fulfil the intent of its propo&s;ers; &s;o on the other, if I apprehend that intent rightly, it would be in it&s;elf inexpedient. I pre&s;ume it to be, that cau&s;es in the federal courts &s;hould be tried by jury, if in the &s;tate where the courts &s;at, that mode of trial would obtain in a &s;imiliar ca&s;e in the &s;tate courts&mdash;that is to &s;ay admiralty cau&s;es &s;hould be tried in Connecticut by a jury, and in New-York without one. The capri|cious operation of &s;o di&s;&s;imilar a method of trial in the &s;ame ca&s;es, under the &s;ame government, is of it&s;elf &s;ufficient to indi&s;po&s;e every well regulated judg|ment towards it. Whether the cau&s;e &s;hould be tried with or without a jury, would depend in a great num|ber of ca&s;es, on the accidental &s;ituation of the court and parties.</P>
<P>But this is not in my e&s;timation the greate&s;t objec|tion. I feel a deep and deliberate conviction, that there are many ca&s;es in which the trial by jury is an ineligible one. I think it &s;o particularly in ca&s;es which concern the public peace with foreign nations; that is in mo&s;t ca&s;es where the que&s;tion turns wholly on the laws of nations. Of this nature among others are all prize cau&s;es. Juries cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed com|petent
<PB N="338" REF="021127_0575_0FB24A966585CDF0">
to inve&s;tigations, that require a thorough know|ledge of the laws and u&s;ages of nations, and they will &s;ometimes be under the influence of impre&s;&s;ions which will not &s;uffer them to pay &s;ufficient regard to tho&s;e con&s;iderations of public policy which ought to guide their enquiries. There would of cour&s;e be always danger that the rights of other nations might be infringed by their deci&s;ions, &s;o as to afford occa|&s;ions of repri&s;al and war. Though the proper pro|vince of juries be to determine matters of fact, yet in mo&s;t ca&s;es legal con&s;equences are complicated with fact in &s;uch a manner as to render a &s;eparation im|practicable.</P>
<P>It will add great weight to this remark in relation to prize cau&s;es to mention that the method of deter|mining them has been thought worthy of particular regulation in various treaties between different powers of Europe, and that pur&s;uant to &s;uch treaties they are determinable in Great-Britain in the la&s;t re&s;ort before the king him&s;elf in his privy council, where the fact as well as the law undergoes a re-exa|mination. This alone demon&s;trates the impolicy of in&s;erting a fundamental provi&s;ion in the con&s;titution which would make the &s;tate &s;y&s;tems a &s;tandard for the national government in the article under con&s;i|deration, and the danger of incumbering the govern|ment with any con&s;titutional provi&s;ions, the propriety of which is not indi&s;putable.</P>
<P>My convictions are equally &s;trong that great advantages re&s;ult from the &s;eparation of the equity from the law juri&s;diction; and that the cau&s;es which belong to the former would be improperly committed to juries. The great and primary u&s;e of a court of equity is to give relief <HI>in extraordinary ca&s;es,</HI> which are <HI>exceptions</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is true that the principles by which that relief is go|verned are now reduced to a regular &s;y&s;tem, but it is not the le&s;s true that they are in the main, applicable to SPECIAL cir|cum&s;tances which form exceptions to general rules.</NOTE> to general rules.

Be&s;ides this the circum&s;tances that con&s;titute ca&s;es proper for courts of equity, are in many in&s;tances &s;o nice and intricate, that they are incompatible with the genius of trials by jury. They require often &s;uch long, deliberate and critical inve&s;ti|gation as would be impracticable to men called from their occupations and obliged to decide before they were permitted to return to them. The &s;implicity and expedition which form the di&s;tingui&s;hing characters of this mode of trial require that the matter to be decided &s;hould be reduced to &s;ome &s;ingle and obvious point; while the litigations u&s;ual in chancery fre|quently comprehend a long train of minute and inde|pendent particulars.</P>
<P>It is true that the &s;eparation of the equity from the legal juri&s;diction is peculiar to the Engli&s;h &s;y&s;tem of juri&s;prudence; which is the model that has been fol|lowed in &s;everal of the &s;tates. But it is equally true, that the trial by jury has been unknown in every ca&s;e in which they have been united. And the &s;epa|ration is e&s;&s;en<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ial to the pre&s;ervation of that in&s;ti|tution in it<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> pri&s;tine purity. The nature of a court of equity will readily permit the exten&s;ion of its juri&s;|diction to matters of law, but it is not a little to be &s;u&s;pected&punc; that the attempt to extend the juri&s;diction of the courts of law to matters of equity will not only be unproductive of the advantages which may be derived from courts of chancery, on the plan upon which they are e&s;tabli&s;hed in this &s;tate, but will tend gradually to change the nature of the courts of law, and to undermine the trial by jury, by in|troducing que&s;tions too complicated for a deci&s;ion in that mode.</P>
<P><PB N="340" REF="021127_0577_0FB24A9B6BF7D430">The&s;e appear to be conclu&s;ive rea&s;ons again&s;t incorporating the &s;y&s;tems of all the &s;tates in the for|mation of the national judiciary; according to what may be conjectured to have been the intent of the Penn&s;ylvania minority. Let us now examine how far the propo&s;ition of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts is calculated to remedy the &s;uppo&s;ed defect.</P>
<P>It is in this form&mdash;
<Q>In civil actions between ci|tizens of different &s;tates, every i&s;&s;ue of fact, ari&s;ing in <HI>actions at common law,</HI> may be tried by a jury, if the parties, or either of them, reque&s;t it.</Q></P>
<P>This at be&s;t is a proportion confined to one de|&s;cription of cau&s;es; and the inference is fair either that the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts convention con&s;idered that as the only cla&s;s of federal cau&s;es, in which the trial by jury would be proper; or that if de&s;irous of a more exten&s;ive provi&s;ion, they found it impracticable to devi&s;e one which would properly an&s;wer the end. If the fir&s;t, the omi&s;&s;ion of a regulation re&s;pecting &s;o partial an object, can never be con&s;idered as a material im|perfection in the &s;y&s;tem. If the la&s;t, it affords a &s;trong corroboration of the extreme difficulty of the thing.</P>
<P>But this is not all: If we advert to the ob&s;ervations already made re&s;pecting the courts that &s;ub&s;i&s;t in the &s;everal &s;tates of the union, and the different powers exerci&s;ed by them, it will appear, that there are no expre&s;&s;ions more vague and indeterminate than tho&s;e which have been employed to characteri&s;e <HI>that</HI> &s;pecies of cau&s;es which it is intended &s;hall be entitled to a trial by jury. In this &s;tate the boundaries between actions at common law and actions of equitable juri&s;|diction are a&s;certained in conformity to the rules which prevail in England upon that &s;ubject. In many of the other &s;tates, the boundaries are le&s;s preci&s;e. In &s;ome of them, every cau&s;e is to be t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ied in a court of com|mon law, and upon that foundation every action may be con&s;idered as an action at common law, to be de|termined by a jury, if the parties or either of them
<PB N="341" REF="021127_0578_0FB24A9D20B39CD0">
chu&s;e it. Hence the &s;ame irregularity and confu&s;ion would be introduced by a compliance with this pro|po&s;ition, that I have already noticed as re&s;ulting from the regulation propo&s;ed by the Penn&s;ylvania minority. In one &s;tate a cau&s;e would receive its determination from a jury, if the parties or either of them reque&s;ted it; but in another &s;tate a cau&s;e exactly &s;imilar to the other mu&s;t be decided without the intervention of a jury, becau&s;e the &s;tate judicatories varied as to com|mon law juri&s;diction.</P>
<P>It is obvious therefore that the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts pro|po&s;ition, upon this &s;ubject, cannot operate as a ge|neral regulation until &s;ome uniform plan, with re&s;pect to the limits of common law and equitable juri&s;dic|tions &s;hall be adopted by the different &s;tates. To devi&s;e a plan of that kind is a ta&s;k arduous in it&s;elf, and which it would require much time and reflection to mature. It would be extremely difficult, if not impo&s;&s;ible, to &s;ugge&s;t any general regulation that would be acceptable to all the &s;tates in the union, or that would perfectly quadrate with the &s;everal &s;tate in&s;titutions.</P>
<P>It may be a&s;ked, why could not a reference have been made to the con&s;titution of this &s;tate, taking that, which is allowed by me to be a good one, as a &s;tandard for the United States? I an&s;wer that it is not very probable the other &s;tates &s;hould entertain the &s;ame opinion of our in&s;titutions which we do our&s;elves. It is natural to &s;uppo&s;e that they are hitherto more at|tached to their own, and that each would &s;truggle for the preference. If the plan of taking one &s;tate as a model for the whole had been thought of in the con|vention, it is to be pre&s;umed that the adoption of it in that body, would have been rendered difficult by the predilection of each repre&s;entation in favour of its own government; and it mu&s;t be uncertain which of the &s;tates would have been taken as the model. It has been &s;hewn that many of them would be im|proper ones. And I leave it to conjecture whether,
<PB N="342" REF="021127_0579_0FB24AA0C681E4C0">
under all circum&s;tances, it is mo&s;t likely that New-York or &s;ome other &s;tate would have been preferred. But admit that a judicious &s;election could have been effected in the convention, &s;till there would have been great danger of jealou&s;y and di&s;gu&s;t in the other &s;tates, at the partiality which had been &s;hewn to the in&s;titutions of one. The enemies of the plan would have been furni&s;hed with a fine pretext for rai&s;ing a ho&s;t of local prejudices again&s;t it, which perhaps might have hazarded in no incon&s;iderable degree, its final e&s;tabli&s;hment.</P>
<P>To avoid the embarra&s;&s;ments of a definition of the ca&s;es which the trial by jury ought to embrace, it is &s;ome times &s;ugge&s;ted by men of enthu&s;ia&s;tic tempers, that a provi&s;ion might have been in&s;erted for e&s;ta|bli&s;hing it in all ca&s;es what&s;oever. For this I believe no precedent is to be found in any member of the union; and the con&s;iderations which have been &s;tated in di&s;cu&s;&s;ing the propo&s;ition of the minority of Penn|&s;ylvania, mu&s;t &s;atisfy every &s;ober mind that the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the trial by jury in <HI>all</HI> ca&s;es, would have been an unpardonable error in the plan.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, the more it is con&s;idered, the more ar|duous will appear the ta&s;k of fa&s;hioning a provi&s;ion in &s;uch a form, as not to expre&s;s too little to an&s;wer the purpo&s;e, or too much to be advi&s;eable; or which might not have opened other &s;ources of oppo&s;ition to the great and e&s;&s;ential object of introducing a firm national government.</P>
<P>I cannot but per&s;uade my&s;elf on the other hand, that the different lights in which the &s;ubject has been placed in the cour&s;e of the&s;e ob&s;ervations, will go far towards removing in candid minds, the appre|hen&s;ions they may have entertained on the point. They have tended to &s;hew that the &s;ecurity of liberty is materially concerned only in the trial by jury in criminal ca&s;es, which is provided for in the mo&s;t ample manner in the plan of the convention; that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the greate<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> proportion of civil ca&s;es, and

tho&s;e in which the great body of the community is intere&s;ted, that mode of trial will remain in its full force, as e&s;tabli&s;hed in the &s;tate con&s;titutions, un|touched and unaffected by the plan of the conven|tion: That it is no ca&s;e aboli&s;hed <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide No. LXXXI, in which the &s;uppo&s;ition of its being aboli&s;hed by the appellate juri&s;diction in matters of fact being ve&s;ted in the &s;upreme court is examined and refuted.</NOTE> by that plan; and that there are great if not in&s;urmountable diffi|culties in the way of making any preci&s;e and proper provi&s;ion for it in a con&s;titution for the United States.</P>
<P>The be&s;t judges of the matter will be the lea&s;t anxious for a con&s;titutional e&s;tabli&s;hment of the trial by jury in civil ca&s;es, and will be the mo&s;t ready to admit that the changes which are continually hap|pening in the affairs of &s;ociety, may render a dif|ferent mode of determining que&s;tions of property, preferable in many ca&s;es, in which that mode of trial now prevails. For my own part, I acknowledge my&s;elf to be convinced that even in this &s;tate, it might be advantageou&s;ly extended to &s;ome ca&s;es to which it does not at pre&s;ent apply, and might as advantageou&s;ly be abridged in others. It is con|ceded by all rea&s;onable men, that it ought not to obtain in all ca&s;es. The examples of innovations which contract its ancient limits, as well in the&s;e &s;tates as in Great-Britain, afford a &s;trong pre&s;ump|tion that its former extent has been found inconve|nient; and give room to &s;uppo&s;e that future expe|rience may di&s;cover the propriety and utility of other exceptions. I &s;u&s;pect it to be impo&s;&s;ible in the nature of the thing, to fix the &s;alutary point at which the operation of the in&s;titution ought to &s;top; and this is with me a &s;trong argument for leaving the matter to the di&s;cretion of the legi&s;lature.</P>
<P>This is now clearly under&s;tood to be the ca&s;e in Great-Britain, and it is equally &s;o in the &s;tate of Con|necticut; and yet it may be &s;afely affirmed, that more numerous encroachments have been made upon

the trial by jury in this &s;tate &s;ince the revolution, though provided for by a po&s;itive article of our con|&s;titution, than has happened in the &s;ame time either in Connecticut or Great-Britain. It may be added that the&s;e encroachments have generally originated with the men who endeavour to per&s;uade the people they are the warme&s;t defenders of popular liberty, but who have rarely &s;uffered con&s;titutional ob&s;tacles to arre&s;t them in a favourite career. The truth is that the general GENIUS of a government is all that can be &s;ub&s;tantially relied upon for permanent effects.

<P>It certainly &s;ounds not a little ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;h and extraor|dinary to affirm that there is no &s;ecurity for liberty in a con&s;titution which expre&s;sly e&s;tabli&s;hes the trial by jury in criminal ca&s;es, becau&s;e it does not do it in civil al&s;o; while it is a notorious fact that Con|necticut, which has been always regarded as the mo&s;t popular &s;tate in the union, can boa&s;t of no con&s;titu|tional provi&s;ion for either.</P>

<P>IN the cour&s;e of the foregoing review of the con&s;ti|tution I have taken notice of, and endeavoured to an&s;wer, mo&s;t of the objections which have appeared again&s;t it. There however remain a few which either did not fall naturally under any particular head, or were forgotten in their proper places. The&s;e
<PB N="345" REF="021127_0582_0FB24AA8296F3938">
&s;hall now be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed; but as the &s;ubject has been drawn into great length, I &s;hall &s;o far con&s;ult brevity as to compri&s;e all my ob&s;ervations on the&s;e mi&s;cel|laneous points in a &s;ingle paper.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t con&s;iderable of the&s;e remaining objec|tions is, that the plan of the convention contains no bill of rights. Among other an&s;wers given to this, it has been upon different occa&s;ions remarked, that the con&s;titutions of &s;everal of the &s;tates are in a &s;imilar predicament. I add, that New-York is of this number. And yet the oppo&s;ers of the new &s;y&s;tem in this &s;tate, who profe&s;s an unlimited admiration for its con&s;titution, are among the mo&s;t intemperate par|tizans of a bill of rights. To ju&s;tify their zeal in this matter, they alledge two things; one is, that though the con&s;titution of New-York has no bill of rights prefixed to it, yet it contains in the body of it various provi&s;ions in favour of particular privileges and rights, which in &s;ub&s;tance amount to the &s;ame thing; the other is, that the con&s;titution adopts in their full extent the common and &s;tatute law of Great-Britain, by which many other rights not expre&s;&s;ed in it are equally &s;ecured.</P>
<P>To the fir&s;t I an&s;wer, that the con&s;titution propo&s;ed by the convention contains, as well as the con&s;ti|tution of this &s;tate, a number of &s;uch provi&s;ions.</P>
<P>Independent of tho&s;e, which relate to the &s;tructure of the government, we find the following:&mdash;Article I. &s;ection 3. clau&s;e 7.
<Q>Judgment in ca&s;es of impeach|ment &s;hall not extend further than to removal from office, and di&s;qualification to hold and enjoy any office of honour, tru&s;t or profit under the United States; but the party convicted &s;hall neverthele&s;s be liable and &s;ubject to indictment, trial, judgment and puni&s;hment, according to law.</Q>

<Q>The trial of all crimes, except in ca&s;es of impeachment, &s;hall be by jury; and &s;uch trial &s;hall be held in the &s;tate where the &s;aid crimes &s;hall have been committed; but when not committed within any &s;tate, the trial &s;hall be at &s;uch place or places as the congre&s;s may by law have directed&punc;</Q>
&mdash;Section 3, of the &s;ame article,

No per&s;on &s;hall be convicted of trea&s;on unle&s;s on the te&s;timony of two witne&s;&s;es to the &s;ame overt act, or on confe&s;&s;ion in open court.</Q>
&mdash;And clau&s;e 3, of the &s;ame &s;ection.
<Q>The congre&s;s &s;hall have power to declare the puni&s;hment of trea&s;on, but no attainder of trea&s;on &s;hall work corruption of blood, or for|feiture, except during the life of the per&s;on attainted.</Q></P>
<P>It may well be a que&s;tion whether the&s;e are not upon the whole, of equal importance with any which are to be found in the con&s;titution of this &s;tate. The e&s;tabli&s;hment of the writ of <HI>habeas corpus,</HI> the pro|hibition of <HI>ex po&s;t facto</HI> laws, and of TITLES OF NOBILITY, <HI>to which we have no corre&s;ponding provi|&s;ions in our con&s;titution,</HI> are perhaps greater &s;ecurities to liberty and republicani&s;m than any it contains. The creation of crimes after the commi&s;&s;ion of the fact, or in other words, the &s;ubjecting of men to pu|ni&s;hment for things which, when they were done, were breaches of no law, and the practice of arbitrary impri&s;onments have been in all ages the favourite and mo&s;t formidable in&s;truments of tyranny. The
<PB N="347" REF="021127_0584_0FB24AABACBE6C08">
ob&s;ervations of the judicious Black&s;tone<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide Black&s;tone's Commentaries, vol. 1, page 136.</NOTE> in reference to the latter, are well worthy of recital.
<Q>To bereave a man of life (&s;ays he) or by violence to confi&s;cate his e&s;tate, without accu&s;ation or trial, would be &s;o gro&s;s and notorious an act of de&s;poti&s;m, as mu&s;t at once convey the alarm of tyranny throughout the whole nation; but confinement of the per&s;on by &s;ecretly hurrying him to goal, where his &s;ufferings are unknown or forgotten, is a le&s;s public, a le&s;s &s;triking, and therefore <HI>a more dangerous engine</HI> of arbitrary government.</Q>
And as a remedy for this fatal evil, he is every where peculiarly emphatical in his encomiums on the <HI>babeas corpus</HI> act, which in one place he calls <Q>the BULWARK of the Briti&s;h con&s;titution.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Idem, vol. 4, page 438.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P>Nothing need be &s;aid to illu&s;trate the importance of the prohibition of titles of nobili<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y. This may truly be denominated the corner &s;tone of republican government; for &s;o long as they are excluded, there can never be &s;erious danger that the government will be any other than that of the people.</P>
<P>To the &s;econd, that is, to the pretended e&s;tabli&s;h|ment of the common and &s;tatute law by the con&s;ti|tution, I an&s;wer, that they are expre&s;sly made &s;ubject
<Q>to &s;uch alterations and provi&s;ions as the legi&s;lature &s;hall from time to time make concerning the &s;ame.</Q>
They are therefore at any moment liable to repeal by the ordinary legi&s;lative power, and of cour&s;e have no con&s;titutional &s;anction. The only u&s;e of the declaration was to recognize the ancient law, and to remove doubts which might have been occa|&s;ioned by the revolution. This con&s;equently can be con&s;idered as no part of a declaration of rights, which under our con&s;titutions mu&s;t be intended as limitations of the power of the government it&s;elf.</P>
<P>It has been &s;everal times truly remarked, that bills of rights are in their or<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">gin, &s;tipulations between
<PB N="348" REF="021127_0585_0FB24AACAE6A2FD8">
kings and their &s;ubjects, abrigements of prerogative in favor of privilege, re&s;ervations of rights not &s;ur|rendered to the prince. Such was MAGNA CHARTA, obtained by the Barons, &s;word in hand, from king John. Such were the &s;ub&s;equent confirmations of that charter by &s;ub&s;equent princes. Such was the <HI>petition of right</HI> a&s;&s;ented to by Charles the Fir&s;t, in the beginning of his reign. Such al&s;o was the de|claration of right pre&s;ented by the lords and commons to the prince of Orange in 1688, and afterwards thrown into the form of an act of parliament, called the bill of rights. It is evident, therefore, that ac|cording to their primitive &s;ignification, they have no application to con&s;titutions profe&s;&s;edly founded upon the power of the people, and executed by their immediate repre&s;entatives and &s;ervants. Here, in &s;trictne&s;s, the people &s;urrender nothing, and as they retain every thing, they have no need of particular re&s;ervations,
<Q>WE THE PEOPLE of the United States, to &s;ecure the ble&s;&s;ings of liberty to our&s;elves and our po&s;terity, do <HI>ordain</HI> and <HI>e&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">abli&s;h</HI> this con|&s;titution for the United States of America.</Q>
Here is a better recognition of popular rights than volumes of tho&s;e aphori&s;ms which make the principal figure in &s;everal of our &s;tate bills of rights, and which would &s;ound much better in a treati&s;e of ethics than in a con&s;titution of government.</P>
<P>But a minute detail of particular rights is cer|tainly far le&s;s applicable to a con&s;titution like that under con&s;ideration, which is merely intended to re|gulate the general political intere&s;ts of the nation, than to a con&s;titution which has the regulation of every &s;pecies of per&s;onal and private concerns. If therefore the loud clamours again&s;t the plan of the convention on this &s;core, are well founded, no epithet<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of reprobation will be too &s;trong for the con&s;titution of this &s;tate. But the truth is, that both of them contain all, which in relation to their objects, is rea&s;onably to be de&s;ired.</P>
<P><PB N="349" REF="021127_0586_0FB24AAE34CA38A0">I go further, and affirm that bills of rights, in the &s;en&s;e and in the extent in which they are contended for, are not only unnece&s;&s;ary in the propo&s;ed con&s;ti|tution, but would even be dangerous. They would contain various exceptions to powers which are not granted; and on this very account, would afford a colourable pretext to claim more than were granted. For why declare that things &s;hall not be done which there is no power to do? Why for in&s;tance, &s;hould it be &s;aid, that the liberty of the pre&s;s &s;hall not be re|&s;trained, when no power is given by which re&s;tric|tions may be impo&s;ed? I will not contend that &s;uch a provi&s;ion would confer a regulating power; but it is evident that it would furni&s;h, to men di&s;po&s;ed to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;urp, a plau&s;ible pretence for claiming that power. They might urge with a &s;emblance of rea&s;on, that the con&s;titution ought not to be charged with the ab&s;urdity of providing again&s;t the abu&s;e of an autho|rity, which was not given, and that the provi&s;ion again&s;t re&s;training the liberty of the pre&s;s afforded a clear implication, that a power to pre&s;cribe proper regulations concerning it, was intended to be ve&s;ted in the national government. This may &s;erve as a &s;pecimen of the numerous handles which would be given to the doctrine of con&s;tructive powers, by the indulgence of an injudicious zeal for bills of rights.</P>
<P>On the &s;ubject of the liberty of the pre&s;s, as much has been &s;aid, I cannot forbear adding a remark or two: In the fir&s;t place, I ob&s;erve that there is not a &s;yllable concerning it in the con&s;titution of this &s;tate&punc; and in the next, I contend that whatever has been &s;aid about it in that of any other &s;tate, amounts to nothing. What &s;ignifies a declaration that
<Q>the liberty of the pre&s;s &s;hall be inviolably pre&s;erved?</Q>
What is the liberty of the pre&s;s? Who can give it any definition which would not leave the utmo&s;t la|titude for eva&s;ion? I hold it to be impracticable; and from this, I infer, that its &s;ecur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ty, whatever one declarations may be in&s;erted in any con&s;titution
<PB N="350" REF="021127_0587_0FB24AB1451135F0">
re&s;pecting it, mu&s;t altogether depend on public opinion, and on the general &s;pirit of the people and of the government.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">To &s;how that there is a power in the con&s;titution by which the liberty of the pre&s;s may be affected, recour&s;e has been had to the power of taxation. It is &s;aid that duties may be laid upon publications &s;o high as to amount to a prohibition. I know not by what logic it could be maintained that the declarations in the &s;tate con&s;titutions, in favour of the freed<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">m of the pre&s;s, would be a con&s;titutional impediment to the impo&s;ition of duties upon publications by the &s;tate legi&s;latures. It cannot certainly be pretended that any degree of duties, h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">wever low, would be an abrigement of the liberty of the p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;s. We know that new&s;|papers are taxed in Great-Britain, and yet it is notorious that the pre&s;s <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o where enjoys greater <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">iberty than in that country. And if duties of any kind may be laid without a v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">olation of that liberty, it is evident that the extent mu&s;t depend on legi&s;|lative di&s;cretion, regulated by public opinion; &s;o that after all, general declarations re&s;pecting the liberty of the pre&s;s will give it no greater &s;ecurity than it will have without them. The &s;ame inva&s;ions of it may be effected under the &s;tate con&s;titutions which contain tho&s;e declarations through the means of taxa|tion, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> under the propo&s;ed con&s;titution which has nothing of the kind It would be quite as &s;ignificant to declare that govern|ment ought to be free&punc; that taxes ought not to be exce&s;&s;ive, &amp;c. as that the liberty of the pre&s;s ought not to be re&s;trained.</NOTE> And here, after all, as inti|mated upon another occa&s;ion, mu&s;t we &s;eek for the only &s;olid ba&s;is of all our rights.</P>
<P>There remai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s but one other view of this matter to conclude the point. The truth is, after all the declamation we have heard, that the con&s;titution is it&s;elf in every rational &s;en&s;e, and to every u&s;eful purpo&s;e, A BILL OF RIGHTS. The &s;everal bills of rights, in Great-Britain, form its con&s;titution, and conver&s;ely the con&s;titution of each &s;tate is its bill of rights. And the propo&s;ed con&s;titution, if adopted, will be the bill of rights of the union. Is it one object of a bill of rights to declare and &s;pecify the political privile<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">es of the citizens in the &s;tructure and admi|ni&s;tration of the government? This is done in the mo&s;t ample and preci&s;e manner in the plan of the convention, c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mprehending various precautions for the public &s;ecurity, which are not to be found in any of the &s;tate con&s;titutions. Is another object of a bill of rights to define certain immunities and modes of
<PB N="351" REF="021127_0588_0FB24AB2B0B41038">
proceeding, which are relative to per&s;onal and pri|vate concerns? This we have &s;een has al&s;o been at|tended to, in a variety of ca&s;es, in the &s;ame plan. Adverting therefore to the &s;ub&s;tantial meaning of a bill of rights, it is ab&s;urd to allege that it is not to be found in the work of the convention. It may be &s;aid that it does not go far enough, though it will not be ea&s;y to make this appear; but it can with no propriety be contended that there is no &s;uch thing. It certainly mu&s;t be immaterial what mode is ob|&s;erved as to the order of declaring the rights of the citizens, if they are to be found in any part of the in&s;trument which e&s;tabli&s;hes the government. And hence it mu&s;t be apparent t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">t much of what has been &s;aid on this &s;ubject re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> merely on verbal and nominal di&s;tinctions, which are entirely foreign from the &s;ub&s;tance of the thing.</P>
<P>Another objection, which has been made, and which from the frequency of its repetition it is to be pre&s;umed is relied on, is of this nature:&mdash;It is improper (&s;ay the objectors) to confer &s;uch large powers, as are propo&s;ed, upon the national govern|ment; becau&s;e the &s;eat of that government mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity be too remote from many of the &s;tates to admit of a proper knowledge on the part of the con|&s;tituent, of the conduct of the repre&s;entative body. This argument, if it proves any thing, proves that there ought to be no general government whatever. For the powers which it &s;eems to be agreed on all hands, ought to be ve&s;ted in the union, cannot be &s;afely intru&s;ted to a body which is not under every requi&s;ite controul. But there are &s;atisfactory rea&s;ons to &s;hew that the objection is in reality not well founded. There is in mo&s;t of the arguments which relate to di&s;tance a palpable illu&s;ion of the imagi|nation. What are the &s;ources of information by which the people in Montgomery county mu&s;t regulate their judgment of the conduct of their repre&s;entatives in the &s;tate legi&s;lature? Of per&s;onal ob&s;ervation they can
<PB N="352" REF="021127_0589_0FB24AB42DBFCAC0">
have no benefit. This is confined to the citizens on the &s;pot. They mu&s;t therefore depend on the infor|mation of intelligent men, in whom they confide&mdash; and how mu&s;t the&s;e men obtain their information? Evidently from the complection of public mea&s;ures, from the public prints, from corre&s;pondences with their repre&s;entatives, and with other per&s;ons who re&s;ide at the place of their deliberation. This does not apply to Montgomery county only, but to all the counties, at any con&s;iderable di&s;tance from the &s;eat of government.</P>
<P>It is equally evident that the &s;ame &s;ources of infor|mation would be open to the people, in relation to the conduct of their repre&s;entatives in the general government; and the impediments to a prompt communication which di&s;tance may be &s;uppo&s;ed to create, will be overballanced by the effects of the vigilance of the &s;tate governments. The executive and legi&s;lative bodies of each &s;tate will be &s;o many <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">entinels over the per&s;ons employed in every depart|ment of the national admini&s;tration; and as it will be in their power to adopt and pur&s;ue a regular and effectual &s;y&s;tem of intelligence, they can never be at a lo&s;s to know the behaviour of tho&s;e who repre&s;ent their con&s;tituents in the national councils, and can readily communicate the &s;ame knowledge to the people. Their di&s;po&s;ition to appri&s;e the community of whatever may prejudice its intere&s;ts from another quarter, may be relied upon, if it were only from the rival&s;hip of power. And we may conclude with the fulle&s;t a&s;&s;urance, that the people, through that channel, will be better informed of the conduct of their na|tional repre&s;entatives, than they can be by any means they now po&s;&s;e&s;s of that of their &s;tate repre&s;entatives.</P>
<P>It ought al&s;o to be remembered, that the citizens who inhabit the country at and near the &s;eat of go|vernment, will in all que&s;tions that affect the general liberty and pro&s;perity, have the &s;ame intere&s;t with tho&s;e who are at a di&s;tance; and that they will &s;tand

ready to &s;ound the alarm when nece&s;&s;ary, and to point out the actors in any pernicious project. The public papers will be expeditious me&s;&s;engers of intelligence to the mo&s;t remote inhabitants of the union.</P>
<P>Among the many extraordinary objections which have appeared again&s;t the propo&s;ed con&s;titution, the mo&s;t extraordinary and the lea&s;t colourable one, is derived from the want of &s;ome provi&s;ion re&s;pecting the debts due <HI>to</HI> the United States. This has been repre&s;ented as a tacit relinqui&s;hment of tho&s;e debts, and as a wicked contrivance to &s;creen public de|faulters. The new&s;papers have teemed with the mo&s;t inflammatory railings on this head; and yet there is nothing clearer than that the &s;ugge&s;tion is entirely void of foundation, and is the offspring of extreme ignorance or extreme di&s;hone&s;ty. In addi|tion to the remarks I have made upon the &s;ubject in another place, I &s;hall only ob&s;erve, that as it is a plain dictate of common &s;en&s;e, &s;o it is al&s;o an e&s;ta|bli&s;hed doctrine of politioal law, that
<Q>States neither lo&s;e any of their rights, nor are di&s;charged from any of their obligations by a change in the form of their civil government.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide Rutherford's In&s;titutes, vol. 2. book 11. chap. x. &s;ect. xiv. and xv.&mdash;Vice al&s;o Grotius, book 11. chap. ix&punc; &s;ect. viii. and ix.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P>The la&s;t objection of any con&s;equence which I at pre&s;ent recollect, turns upon the article of expence. If it were even true that the adoption of the pro|po&s;ed government would occa&s;ion a con&s;iderable in|crea&s;e of expence, it would be an objection that ought to have no weight again&s;t the plan. The great bulk of the citizens of America, are with rea&s;on convinced that union is the ba&s;is of their political happine&s;s. Men of &s;en&s;e of all parties now, with few exceptions, agree that it cannot be pre&s;erved under the pre&s;ent &s;y&s;tem, nor without radical alter|ations; that new and exten&s;ive powers ought to be granted to the national head, and that the&s;e require
<PB N="354" REF="021127_0591_0FB247B2B6903B30">
a different organization of the federal government, a &s;ingle body being an un&s;afe depo&s;itory of &s;uch ample authorities. In conceding all this, the que&s;tion of expence mu&s;t be given up, for it impo&s;&s;ible, with any degree of &s;afety, to narrow the foundation upon which the &s;y&s;tem is to &s;tand. The two branches of t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> legi&s;lature are in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, to con&s;i&s;t of only &s;ixty-five per&s;ons, which is the &s;ame number of which congre&s;s, under the exi&s;ting confederation, may be compo&s;ed. It is true that this number is intended to be increa&s;ed; but this is to keep pace with the increa&s;e of the population and re&s;ources of the country. It is evident, that a le&s;s number would, even in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, have been un&s;afe; and that a continuance of the pre&s;ent number would, in a more advanced &s;tage of population, be a very in|adequate repre&s;entation of the people.</P>
<P>Whence is the dreaded augmentation of expence to &s;pring? One &s;ource pointed out, is the multipli|cation of offices under the new government. Let us examine this a little.</P>
<P>It is evident that the principal departments of the admini&s;tration under the pre&s;ent government, are the &s;ame which will be required under the new. There are now a &s;ecretary at war, a &s;ecretary for foreign affairs, a &s;ecretary for dome&s;tic affairs, a board of trea&s;ury con&s;i&s;ting of three per&s;ons, a trea|&s;urer, a&s;&s;i&s;tants, clerks, &amp;c. The&s;e offices are in|di&s;pen&s;able under any &s;y&s;tem, and will &s;uffice under the new as well as under the old. As to amba&s;&s;adors and other mini&s;ters and agents in foreign countries, the propo&s;ed con&s;titution can make no other dif|ference, than to render their characters, where they re&s;ide, more re&s;pectable, and their &s;ervices more u&s;eful. As to per&s;ons to be employed in the collec|tion of the revenues, it is unque&s;tionably true that the&s;e will form a very con&s;iderable addition to the number of federal officers; but it will not follow, that this will occa&s;ion an increa&s;e of public expence.
<PB N="355" REF="021127_0592_0FB247A78B76D850">
It will be in mo&s;t ca&s;es nothing more than an ex|change of &s;tate officers for national officers. In the collection of all duties, for in&s;tance, the per&s;ons em|ployed will be wholly of the latter de&s;cription. The &s;tates individually will &s;tand in no need of any for this purpo&s;e. What difference can it make in point of expence, to pay officers of the cu&s;toms appointed by the &s;tate, or tho&s;e appointed by the United States? There is no good rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e, that either the number or the &s;alaries of the latter, will be greater than tho&s;e of the former.</P>
<P>Where then are we to &s;eek for tho&s;e additional ar|ticles of expence which are to &s;well the account to the enormous &s;ize that has been repre&s;ented to us? The chief item which occurs to me, re&s;pects the &s;upport of the judges of the United States. I do not add the pre&s;ident, becau&s;e there is now a pre&s;ident of congre&s;s, who&s;e expences may not be far, if any thing, &s;hort of tho&s;e which will be incurred on account of the pre|&s;ident of the United States. The &s;upport of the judges will clearly be an extra expence, but to what extent will depend on the particular plan which may be adopted in practice in regard to this matter. But it can upon no rea&s;onable plan amount to a &s;um which will be an object of material con&s;equence.</P>
<P>Let us now &s;ee what there is to counterballance any extra expences that may attend the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the propo&s;ed government. The fir&s;t thing that pre&s;ents it&s;elf is, that a great part of the bu&s;ine&s;s, which now keeps congre&s;s &s;itting through the year, will be tran&s;acted by the pre&s;ident. Even the ma|nagement of foreign negociations will naturally devolve upon him according to general principles concerted with the &s;enate, and &s;ubject to their final concurrence. Hence it is evident, that a portion of the year will &s;uffice for the &s;e&s;&s;ion of both the &s;enate and the hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives: We may &s;uppo&s;e about a fourth for the latter, and a third or perhaps a half for the former. The extra bu&s;ine&s;s of treaties
<PB N="356" REF="021127_0593_0FB247A8EA491E78">
and appointments may give this extra occupation to the &s;enate. From this circum&s;tance we may infer, that until the hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives &s;hall be in|crea&s;ed greatly beyond its pre&s;ent number, there will be a con&s;iderable &s;aving of expence from the dif|ference between the con&s;tant &s;e&s;&s;ion of the pre&s;ent, and the temporary &s;e&s;&s;ion of the future congre&s;s.</P>
<P>But there is another circum&s;tance, of great impor|tance in the view of economy. The bu&s;ine&s;s of the United States has hitherto occupied the &s;tate legi&s;la|tures as well as congre&s;s. The latter has made re|qui&s;itions which the former have had to provide for. Hence it has happened that the &s;e&s;&s;ions of the &s;tate legi&s;latures have been protracted greatly beyond what was nece&s;&s;ary for the execution of the mere local bu&s;ine&s;s of the &s;tates. More than half their time has been frequently employed in matters which related to the United States. Now the members who com|po&s;e the legi&s;latures of the &s;everal &s;tate amount to two thou&s;and and upwards; which number has hitherto performed what under the new &s;y&s;tem will be done in the fir&s;t in&s;tance by &s;ixty-five per&s;ons, and probably at no future period by above a fourth or a fifth of that number. The congre&s;s under the propo&s;ed govern|ment will do all the bu&s;ine&s;s of the United States them&s;elves, without the intervention of the &s;tate legi&s;latures, who thenceforth will have only to attend to the affairs of their particular &s;tates, and will not have to &s;it in any proportion as long as they have heretofore done. This difference, in the time of the &s;e&s;&s;ions of the &s;tate legi&s;latures, will be all clear gain, and will alone form an article of &s;aving, which may be regarded as an equivalent for any additional objects of expence that may be occa&s;ioned by the adoption of the new &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>The re&s;ult from the&s;e ob&s;ervations is, that the &s;ources of additional expence from the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the propo&s;ed con&s;titution are much fewer than may have been imagined, that they are counterbalanced
<PB N="357" REF="021127_0594_0FB247AF44D2E8B8">
by con&s;iderable objects of &s;aving, and that while it is que&s;tionable on which &s;ide the &s;cale will prepon|derate, it is certain that a government le&s;s expen&s;ive would be incompetent to the purpo&s;es of the union.</P>

<HEAD>NUMBER LXXXV. Conclu&s;ion.</HEAD>
<P>ACCORDING to the formal divi&s;ion of the &s;ubject of the&s;e papers, announced in my fir&s;t number, there would appear &s;till to remain for di&s;cu&s;|&s;ion, two points,
<Q>the analogy of the propo&s;ed go|vernment to your own &s;tate con&s;titution,</Q>
and
<Q>the additional &s;ecurity, which its adoption will afford to republican government, to liberty and to pro|perty.</Q>
But the&s;e heads have been &s;o fully antici|pated and exhau&s;ted in the progre&s;s of the work, that it would now &s;carcely be po&s;&s;ible to do any thing more than repeat, in a more dilated form, what has been heretofore &s;aid; which the advanced &s;tage of the que&s;tion, and the time already &s;pent upon it con|&s;pire to forbid.</P>
<P>It is remarkable, that the re&s;emblance of the pla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of the convention to the act which organizes the go|vernment of this &s;tate holds, not le&s;s with regard to many of the &s;uppo&s;ed defects, than to the real ex|cellencies of the former. Among the pretended defects, are the re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eligibility of the executive, the want of a council, the omi&s;&s;ion of a formal bill of rights, the omi&s;&s;ion of a provi&s;ion re&s;pecting the liberty of the pre&s;s: The&s;e and &s;everal others, which have been noted in the cour&s;e of our inquiries, are as much chargeable on the exi&s;ting con&s;titution of this &s;tate, as on the one propo&s;ed for the Union. And a man mu&s;t have &s;lender preten&s;ions to con&s;i&s;t|ency, who can rail at the latter for imperfections
<PB N="358" REF="021127_0595_0FB247B4284EF840">
which he finds no difficulty in excu&s;ing in the former. Nor indeed can there be a better proof of the in&s;in|cerity and affectation of &s;ome of the zealous adver|&s;aries of the plan of the convention among us, who profe&s;s to be the devoted admirers of the government under which they live, than the fury with which they have attacked that plan, for matters in regard to which our own con&s;titution is equally, or perhaps more vulnerable.</P>
<P>The additional &s;ecurities to republican govern|ment, to liberty and to property, to be derived from the adoption of the plan under con&s;ideration, con&s;i&s;t chiefly in the re&s;traints which the pre&s;ervation of the union will impo&s;e on local factions and in&s;urrections, and on the ambition of powerful individuals in &s;ingle &s;tates, who might acquire credit and influence enough, from leaders and favorites, to become the de&s;pots of the people; in the diminution of the op|portunities to foreign intrigue, which the di&s;&s;olution of the confederacy would invite and facilitate; in the prevention of exten&s;ive military e&s;tabli&s;hments, which could not fail to grow out of wars between the &s;tates in a di&s;united &s;ituation; in the expre&s;s gua|rantee of a republican form of government to each; in the ab&s;olute and univer&s;al exclu&s;ion of titles of nobility; and in the precautions again&s;t the repeti|tion of tho&s;e practices on the part of the &s;tate govern|ments, which have undermined the foundations of property and credit, have planted mutual di&s;tru&s;t in the brea&s;ts of all cla&s;&s;es of citizens, and have occa|&s;ioned an alm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;t univer&s;al pro&s;tration of morals.</P>
<P>Thus have I, my fellow citizens, executed the ta&s;k I had a&s;&s;igned to my&s;elf; with what &s;ucce&s;s, your conduct mu&s;t determine. I tru&s;t at lea&s;t you will admit, that I have not failed in the a&s;&s;urance I gave you re&s;pecting the &s;pirit with which my endea|vours &s;hould be conducted. I have addre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf purely to your judgments, and have &s;tudiou&s;ly avoided tho&s;e a&s;perities which are too apt to di&s;grace

political di&s;putants of all parties, and which have been not a little provoked by the language and conduct of the opponents of the con&s;titution. The charge of a con&s;piracy again&s;t the liberties of the people, which has been indi&s;criminately brought again&s;t the advocates of the plan, has &s;omething in it too wanton and too malignant not to excite the indignation of every man who feels in his own bo&s;om a refutation of the calumny. The perpetual changes which have been rung upon the wealthy, the well-born and the great, have been &s;uch as to in&s;pire the di&s;gu&s;t of all &s;en&s;ible men. And the unwarrantable concealments and mi&s;repre&s;entations which have been in various ways practiced to keep the truth from the public eye, have been of a nature to demand the re|probation of all hone&s;t men. It is not impo&s;&s;ible that the&s;e circum&s;tances may have occa&s;ionally be|trayed me into intemperances of expre&s;&s;ion which I did not intend: It is certain that I have frequently felt a &s;truggle between &s;en&s;ibility and moderation, and if the former has in &s;ome in&s;tances prevailed, it mu&s;t be my excu&s;e, that it has been neither often nor much.</P>
<P>Let us now pau&s;e and a&s;k our&s;elves whether, in the cour&s;e of the&s;e papers, the propo&s;ed con&s;titution has not been &s;atisfactorily vindicated from the a&s;per&s;ions thrown upon it, and whether it has not been &s;hewn to be worthy of the public approbation, and nece&s;|&s;ary to the public &s;afety and pro&s;perity. Every man is bound to an&s;wer the&s;e que&s;tions to him&s;elf, accord|ing to the be&s;t of his con&s;cience and under&s;tanding, and to act agreeably to the genuine and &s;ober dictates of his judgment. This is a duty, from which nothing can give him a di&s;pen&s;ation.&mdash;'Tis one that he is called upon, nay, con&s;trained by all the obligations that form the bands of &s;ociety, to di&s;charge &s;incerely and hone&s;tly. &mdash; No partial motive, no particular <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ntere&s;t, no pride of opinion, no temporary pa&s;&s;ion or prejudice, will ju&s;tify to him&s;elf, to his country or to his

<P>I &s;hall not di&s;&s;emble, that I feel an intire confi|dence in the arguments, which recommend the pro|po&s;ed &s;y&s;tem to your adoption; and that I am unable to di&s;cern any real force in th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e by which it has been oppo&s;ed. I am per&s;uaded, that it is the be&s;t which our political &s;ituation, habits and opinions will admit, and &s;uperior to any the revolution has produced.</P>
<P>Conce&s;&s;ions on the part of the friends of the plan, that it has not a claim to ab&s;olute perfection, have afforded matter of no &s;mall triumph to its enemies. Why, &s;ay they, &s;hould we adopt an imperfect thing? Why not amend it, and make it perfect before it is irrevocably e&s;tabli&s;hed? This may be plau&s;ible enough, but it is only plau&s;ible. In the fir&s;t place I remark, that the extent of the&s;e conce&s;&s;ions has been greatly exaggerated They have been &s;tated as amounting to an admi&s;&s;ion, that the plan is radically defective; and that, without material alterations, the rights and the intere&s;ts of the community cannot be &s;afely confided to it. This, as far as I have un|der&s;tood the meaning of tho&s;e who make the conce&s;|&s;ions, is an intire perver&s;ion of their &s;en&s;e. No ad|vocate of the mea&s;ure can be found who will not declare as his &s;entiment, that the &s;y&s;tem, though it may not be perfect in every part, is upon the whole a good one, is the be&s;t that the pre&s;ent views and circum&s;tances of the country will permit, and is &s;uch an one as promi&s;es every &s;pecies of &s;ecurity which a rea&s;onable people can de&s;ire.</P>

&s;tate of our national affairs, and to expo&s;e the union to the jeopardy of &s;ucce&s;&s;ive experiments, in the chi|merical pur&s;uit of a perfect plan. I never expect to &s;ee a perfect work from imperfect man. The re&s;ult of the deliberations of all collective bodies mu&s;t ne|ce&s;&s;arily be a compound as well of the errors and prejudices, as of the good &s;en&s;e and wi&s;dom of the individuals of whom they are compo&s;ed. The com|pacts which are to embrace thirteen di&s;tinct &s;tates, in a common bond of amity and union, mu&s;t as ne|ce&s;&s;arily be a compromi&s;e of as many di&s;&s;imilar intere&s;ts and inclinations. How can perfection &s;pring from &s;uch materials?</P>
<P>The rea&s;ons a&s;&s;igned in an excellent little pamphlet lately publi&s;hed in this city<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Intitled "An Addre&s;s, to the people of the &s;tate of New-York."</NOTE> are unan&s;werable to &s;hew the utter improbability of a&s;&s;embling a new conven|tion, under circum&s;tances in any degree &s;o favourable to a happy i&s;&s;ue, as tho&s;e in which the late convention met, deliberated and concluded. I will not repeat the arguments there u&s;ed, as I pre&s;ume the produc|tion it&s;elf has had an exten&s;ive circulation. It is cer|tainly well worthy the peru&s;al of every friend to his country. There is however one point of light in which the &s;ubject of amendments &s;till remains to be con&s;idered; and in which it has not yet been exhi|bited to public view. I cannot re&s;olve to conclude, without fir&s;t taking a &s;urvey of it in this a&s;pect.</P>
<P>It appears to me &s;u&s;ceptible of ab&s;olute demon&s;tra|tion, that it will be far more ea&s;y to obtain &s;ub&s;equent than previous amendments to the con&s;titution. The moment an alteration is made in the pre&s;ent plan, it becomes, to the purpo&s;e of adoption, a new one, and mu&s;t undergo a new deci&s;ion of each &s;tate. To its complete e&s;tabli&s;hment throughout the union, it will therefore require the concurrence of thirteen &s;tates. If, on the contrary, the con&s;titution propo&s;ed &s;hould once be ratified by all the &s;tates as it &s;tands, altera|tions in it may at any time be effected by nine &s;tates.
<PB N="362" REF="021127_0599_0FB247C54241AEB8">
Here then the chances are as thirteen to nine<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It may rather be &s;aid TEN, for though two-thirds may &s;et <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n foot the mea&s;ure, three-fourths mu&s;t ratify.</NOTE> in favour of &s;ub&s;equent amendments, rather than of the original adoption of an intire &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>This is not all. Every con&s;titution for the United States mu&s;t inevitably con&s;i&s;t of a great variety of particulars, in which thirteen independent &s;tates are to be accommodated in their intere&s;ts or opinions of intere&s;t. We may of cour&s;e expect to &s;ee, in any body of men charged with its original formation, very different combinations of the parts upon different points. Many of tho&s;e who form the majority on one que&s;tion may become the minority on a &s;econd, and an a&s;&s;ociation di&s;&s;imilar to either may con&s;titute the majority on a third. Hence the nece&s;&s;ity of mould|ing and arranging all the particulars which are to compo&s;e the whole in &s;uch a manner as to &s;atisfy all the parties to the compact; and hence al&s;o an immen&s;e multiplication of difficulties and ca&s;ualties in obtain|ing the collective a&s;&s;ent to a final act. The degree of that multiplication mu&s;t evidently be in a ratio to the number of particulars and the number of parties.</P>
<P>But every amendment to the con&s;titution, if once e&s;tabli&s;hed, would be a &s;ingle propo&s;ition, and might be brought forward &s;ingly. There would then be no nece&s;&s;ity for management or compromi&s;e, in relation to any other point, no giving nor taking. The will of the requi&s;ite number would at once bring the matter to a deci&s;ive i&s;&s;ue. And con&s;equently when|ever nine&punc;<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">It may rather be &s;aid TEN, for though two-thirds may &s;et <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n foot the mea&s;ure, three-fourths mu&s;t ratify.</NOTE> or rather ten &s;tates, were united in the de&s;ire of a particular amendment, that amendment mo&s;t infallibly take place. There can therefore be no compari&s;on between the facility of eff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cting an amendment, and that of e&s;tabli&s;hing in the fir&s;t in|&s;tance a complete con&s;titution.</P>
<P>In oppo&s;ition to the probability of &s;ub&s;equent amendments it has been urged, that the per&s;ons dele|gated to the admini&s;tration of the national govern|ment,
<PB N="363" REF="021127_0600_0FB247C7C3889A20">
will always be di&s;inclined to yield up any portion of the authority of which they were once po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed. For my own part I acknowledge a thorough conviction that any amendments which may, upon mature con&s;ideration, be thought u&s;eful, will be appli|cable to the organization of the government, not to the ma&s;s of its powers; and on this account alone, I think there is no weight in the ob&s;ervation ju&s;t &s;tated. I al&s;o think there is little weight in it on another account. The intrin&s;ic difficulty of govern|ing THIRTEEN STATES at any rate, independent of calculations upon an ordinary degree of public &s;pirit and integrity, will, in my opinion, con&s;tantly <HI>impo&s;e</HI> on the national rulers the <HI>nece&s;&s;ity</HI> of a &s;pirit of accommodation to the rea&s;onable expectations of their con&s;tituents. But there is yet a further con&s;ideration, which proves beyond the po&s;&s;ibility of doubt, that the ob&s;ervation is futile. It is this, that the national rulers, whenever nine &s;tates concur, will have no option upon the &s;ubject. By the fifth article of the plan the congre&s;s will be <HI>obliged.</HI>
<Q>on the application of the legi&s;latures of two-thirds of the &s;tates, (which at pre&s;ent amounts to nine) to call a convention for propo&s;ing amendments, which <HI>&s;hall be valid</HI> to all intents and purpo&s;es, as part of the con&s;titution, when ratified by the legi&s;latures of three-fourths of the &s;tates, or by conventions in three-fourths thereof.</Q>
The words of this article are peremp|tory. The congre&s;s "<HI>&s;hall</HI> call a convention." No|thing in this particular is left to the di&s;cretion of that body. And of con&s;equence all the declamation about their di&s;inclination to a change, vani&s;hes in air. Nor however difficult it may be &s;uppo&s;ed to unite two-thirds or three-fourths of the &s;tate legi&s;latures, in amendments which may affect local intere&s;ts, can there be any room to apprehend any &s;uch difficulty in a union on points which are merely rela<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ive to the general liberty or &s;ecurity of the people. We may &s;afely rely on the di&s;po&s;ition of the &s;tate legi&s;latures
<PB N="364" REF="021127_0601_0FB247C92F7229F8">
to erect barriers again&s;t the encroachments of the national authority.</P>
<P>If the foregoing argument is a fallacy, certain it is that I am my&s;elf deceived by it; for it is, in my conception, one of tho&s;e rare in&s;tances in which a political truth can be brought to the te&s;t of mathe|matical demon&s;tration. Tho&s;e who &s;ee the matter in the &s;ame light with me, however zealous they may be for amendments, mu&s;t agree in the propriety of a previous adoption, as the mo&s;t direct road to their own object.</P>
<P>The zeal for attempts to amend, prior to the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the con&s;titution, mu&s;t abate in every man, who, is ready to accede to the truth of the following ob&s;ervations of a writer, equally &s;olid and ingenious:&mdash;
<Q>To balance a large &s;tate or &s;ociety (&s;ays he) whether monarchical or republican, on general laws, is a work of &s;o great difficulty, that no human genius, however comprehen&s;ive, is able by the mere dint of rea&s;on and reflection, to effect it. The judgments of many mu&s;t unite in the work: EXPERIENCE mu&s;t guide their labour: TIME mu&s;t bring it to perfection: And the FEEL|ING of inconveniences mu&s;t correct the mi&s;takes which they <HI>inevitably</HI> fall into, in their fir&s;t trials and experiments.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hume's E&s;&s;ays, vol. 1, page 128.&mdash;The ri&s;e of arts and &s;ciences.</NOTE></Q>
The&s;e judicious reflections contain a le&s;&s;on of moderation to all the &s;incere lovers of the union, and ought to put them upon their guard again&s;t hazarding anarchy, civil war, a perpetual alienation of the &s;tates from each other, and perhaps the military de&s;poti&s;m of a victorious demagogue, in the pur&s;uit of what they are not likely to obtain, but from TIME and EXPERIENCE. It may be in me a defect of political fortitude, but I acknowledge, that I cannot entertain an equal tranquillity with tho&s;e who affect to treat the dangers of a longer conti|nuance in our pre&s;ent &s;ituation as imaginary.

NATION without a NATIONAL GOVERNMENT is, in my view, an awful &s;pectacle.

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WE have now the honor to &s;ubmit to the con&s;i|deration of the United States in Congre&s;s a&s;&s;em|bled, that con&s;titution which has appeared to us the mo&s;t advi&s;eable.</P>
<P>The friends of our country have long &s;een and de&s;ired, that the power of making war, peace and treaties, that of levying money and regulating commerce, and the corre&s;pondent executive and judicial authorities &s;hould be fully and effectually ve&s;ted in the general government of the union: but the impropriety of delegating &s;uch exten&s;ive tru&s;t to one b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">dy of men is evident. Hence re&s;ults the nece&s;&s;ity of a different organization.</P>
<P>It is obviou&s;ly impracticable in the federal go|vernment of the&s;e &s;tates, to &s;ecure all rights of independent &s;overeignty to each, and yet provide for the intere&s;t and &s;afety of all. Individuals enter|ing into &s;ociety, mu&s;t give up a &s;hare of liberty to pre&s;erve the re&s;t. The magnitude of the &s;acrifice mu&s;t depend as well on &s;ituation and circum&s;tance,
<PB N="384" REF="021127_0620_0FB248B9FB6FED58" MS="y">
as on the object to be obtained. It is at all times difficult to draw with preci&s;ion the line between tho&s;e rights which mu&s;t be &s;urrendered, and tho&s;e which may be re&s;erved; and on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a&s;ion this difficulty was increa&s;ed by a difference among the &s;everal &s;tates as to their &s;ituation, extent, habits, and particular intere&s;ts.</P>
<P>In all our deliberations on this &s;ubject we kept &s;teadily in our view, that which appears to us the greate&s;t intere&s;t ef every true American, the con|&s;olidation of our union, in which is invol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">r pro&s;perity, felicity, &s;afety, perhaps our national exi&s;tance. This important con&s;ideration, &s;eriou&s;ly and deeply impre&s;&s;ed on our minds, led each &s;tate in the convention to be le&s;s rigid on points of inferior magnitude, than might have been otherwi&s;e expec|ted; and thus the con&s;titution, which we now pre|&s;ent, is the re&s;ult of a &s;pirit of amity, and of that mutual deference and conce&s;&s;ion which the peculi|arity of our political &s;ituation rendered indi&s;pen&s;ible.</P>
<P>That it will meet the full and entire approbation of every &s;tate is not perhaps to be expected; but but each will doubtle&s;s con&s;ider, that had her in|tere&s;ts been alone con&s;ulted, the con&s;equences might have been particularly di&s;agreeable or injurous to o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hers; that it is liable to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s few exceptions as could rea&s;onably have been expected, we hope and believe; that it may promote the la&s;ting welfare of that country &s;o dear to us all, and &s;ecure her freedom and happine&s;s, is our mo&s;t ardent wi&s;h.</P>
