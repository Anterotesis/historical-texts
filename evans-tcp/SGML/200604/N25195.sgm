<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>A PROCLAMATION of the Pre&s;ident of the United States, appointing a day of prayer or thank&s;giving, is not to be con&s;idered as an act of legi&s;lative or executive authority; becau&s;e no power is delegated, by the Con&s;titution, to any per&s;on to direct us in matters of religion; nei|ther is it an a&s;&s;umption of power or an act of im|perfect authority, which needs the interpo&s;ition of another power to give it effect. But it is a letter of advice, or a friendly call, from a man, whom the people have placed at their head, inviting us to join with him and with one another, in an act of national piety and devotion.</P>
<P>THE propriety of &s;uch a call, from &s;uch a per|&s;on, is &s;o evident, that nothing can be &s;aid to make it more evident. Every man who has a &s;en&s;e of his duty to GOD as our pre&s;erver, benefactor and Supreme Governor, mu&s;t, at once, approve it, and be plea&s;ed with it. Had this friendly notice been given in any other way; had it been communi|cated by a private letter to each religious &s;ociety or mini&s;ter, it would have had the &s;ame effect as when it comes in the form of a public proclama|tion.</P>
<P>IN the &s;ame light, I have always viewed the pub|lic calls of the Chief Magi&s;trate of any particular State, to keep days of fa&s;ting and thank&s;giving. The proclamation is not an act of authority; but
<PB N="vi" REF="033394_0004_0FF6DF7A44B421D0">
of friend&s;hip, of piety and gratit<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="4 letters">; and derives all its efficacy from the rea&s;onablene&s;s of the duty recommended, and from our own con&s;ent. Our Chief Magi&s;trates are &s;o convinced of this, that, though in &s;ome in&s;tances, formerly, the words <HI>en|join, require</HI> and <HI>forbid,</HI> may have been u&s;ed; yet now we hear nothing but the language of <HI>recom|mendation</HI> and <HI>advice.</HI> The voice of authority in matters of religion is not a&s;&s;umed by American rulers; and if a&s;&s;umed, would not be approved, by American people.</P>
<P>IF there be any in&s;tances of oppo&s;ition to a com|pliance with &s;o rational a duty, as is thus recom|mended, it is not a &s;ubject of wonder. We are a&s;&s;ured, that, in the mo&s;t happy times, there will be a di&s;appointed party, who, though &s;ilenced and incapable of doing mi&s;chief, will &s;ecretly bla&s;pheme. The old &s;erpent, when bound and ca&s;t into the bottomle&s;s pit, will retain his &s;erpentine di&s;po|&s;ition, and take the fir&s;t opportunity, when per|mitted, again to deceive the nations. So it mu&s;t be expected that his emi&s;&s;aries will rebel in their hearts, and gnaw their tongues for pain; for evil men and &s;educers will grow wor&s;e and wor&s;e, de|ceiving and being deceived.</P>

<Q><BIBL><HI>DANIEL ii.42, 43.</HI></BIBL>
<P>And as the toes of the feet were part of iron and part of clay; &s;o the kingdom &s;hall be partly &s;trong and partly broken. And whereas thou &s;awe&s;t iron mixed with miry clay, they &s;hall mingle them&s;elves with the &s;eed of men, but they &s;hall not cleave one to another, even as iron is not mixed with clay.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>ONE great u&s;e and intention of prophecy is to keep alive the faith and hope of God's people in times of calamity and di&s;tre&s;s. When the city and temple of Jeru&s;alem had been de|&s;troyed, and the Jews were carried to Babylon, they had the comfort of the prophecies which had been delivered by I&s;aiah and Jeremiah, that the captivity would continue no more than &s;eventy years; and that at the expiration of that period, a prince &s;hould ari&s;e, by the name of Cyrus, who would cau&s;e the people to be re&s;tored to their own land, and their city and temple to be rebuilt. Dur|ing this period of the &s;eventy years captivity, there was a &s;eries of revelations made to Daniel, and by him recorded for the in&s;truction and comfort of God's people, in every age of the church; the&s;e revelations were made to him in vi&s;ionary and
<PB N="8" REF="033394_0006_0FF6DF7ED9B42F58">
figurative repre&s;entations, and the &s;ubjects of them were the remarkable events which &s;hould befal tho&s;e nations, with whom the church of God &s;hould be connected till the &s;econd coming of Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>THE words now read are part of one of the&s;e revelations. Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, had a dream which made an unea&s;y impre&s;&s;ion on his mind, but he had forgotten the particulars, and could by no means recollect it, nor could any of the wi&s;e men of Babylon a&s;&s;i&s;t him in recovering it. They could indeed, by certain rules, interpret a dream when it was related to them; but it was beyond their art and &s;kill, to tell a per&s;on what he had dreamed, when he him&s;elf had forgotten it. None could do this but the God "who&s;e dwelling was not with fle&s;h." For this incapacity, the mon|arch, in a fit of tyrannic pa&s;&s;ion, commanded all the wi&s;e men in Babylon to be &s;lain; and among them, Daniel and his companions were to be put to death; but upon his promi&s;e to &s;hew the king his dream, a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of the decree was obtain|ed; and after &s;olemn prayer to God, the &s;ecret was revealed to Daniel, who declared it to the king in the&s;e words. "Thou, O king, &s;awe&s;t, and be|hold, a great image. This great image, who&s;e brightne&s;s was excellent, &s;tood before thee, and the form thereof was terrible. This image's head was of fine gold, his brea&s;t and his arms of &s;ilver, his belly and his thighs of bra&s;s, his legs of iron, his feet part of iron and part of clay. Thou &s;awe&s;t till that a &s;tone was cut out without hands, which &s;mote the image upon his feet that were of iron
<PB N="9" REF="033394_0007_0FF6DF8080F452E0">
and clay, and brake them to pieces. Then was the iron, the clay, the bra&s;s, the &s;ilver, and the gold, broken to pieces together, and became like the chaff of the &s;ummer thre&s;hing-floors; and the wind carried them away, that no place was found for them: and the &s;tone that &s;mote the image became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth. This is the dream, and we will tell the interpretation thereof before the king. Thou, O king, art a king of kings; for the God of Heaven hath given thee a kingdom, power, and &s;trength, and glory. And where&s;oever the children of men dwell, the bea&s;ts of the field and the fowls of the heaven, hath he given into thine hand, and hath made thee ruler over them all. Thou art this head of gold. And after thee &s;hall ari&s;e another kingdom inferior to thee, and another third kingdom of bra&s;s, which &s;hall bear rule over all the earth. And the fourth kingdom &s;hall be &s;trong as iron: fora&s;much as iron breaketh in pieces and &s;ubdueth all things; and as iron that breaketh all the&s;e, &s;hall it break in pieces and brui&s;e. And whereas thou &s;awe&s;t the feet and toes part of potters' clay and part of iron; the kingdom &s;hall be divided; but there &s;hall be in it of the &s;trength of iron, fora&s;much as thou &s;awe&s;t the iron mixed with miry clay. And as the toes of the feet were part of iron and part of clay; &s;o the kingdom &s;hall be partly &s;trong, and partly bro|ken. And whereas thou &s;awe&s;t iron mixed with miry clay, they &s;hall mingle them&s;elves with the &s;eed of men; but they &s;hall not cleave one to an|other, even as iron is not mixed with clay. And in the days of the&s;e kings &s;hall the God of Heaven
<PB N="10" REF="033394_0008_0FF6DF82CFB85678">
&s;et up a kingdom, which &s;hall never be de&s;troyed: and the kingdom &s;hall not be left to other people, but it &s;hall break in pieces and con&s;ume all the&s;e kingdoms, and it &s;hall &s;tand forever. Fora&s;much as thou &s;awe&s;t that the &s;tone was cut out of the mountain without hands, and that it brake in pieces the iron, the bra&s;s, the clay, the &s;ilver, and the gold; the great God hath made known to the king what &s;hall come to pa&s;s hereafter; and the dream is certain, and the interpretation thereof &s;ure." The &s;ame &s;eries of events was afterward repre&s;ented to Daniel him&s;elf, in a vi&s;ion of four bea&s;ts, an&s;wering to the four parts of the image, and &s;ignifying the &s;ame four kingdoms, with &s;ome farther particulars relating to the church of God. This vi&s;ion is recorded in the 7th chapter; and there is another vi&s;ion repre&s;enting the &s;ame events, by the figures of a ram and a goat, in the 8th chapter. The&s;e vi&s;ions were intended to conduct the mind of devout inquirers, through all the grand events, to the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the univer&s;al kingdom of the Son of God, which will break in pieces and de&s;troy all the&s;e kingdoms, and &s;tand forever.</P>
<P>IF it be a&s;ked, In what part of the times, &s;igni|fied by this vi&s;ion, do we live? or what events, here &s;et down, are to us pa&s;t, pre&s;ent, and future? To give an an&s;wer to this que&s;tion, we mu&s;t con|&s;ider how far divine Providence has explained the vi&s;ion in its &s;everal parts. The golden head of the image, as Daniel him&s;elf &s;aid, was the Babylonian empire, of which Nebuchadnezzar was the reign|ing prince; "Thou art this head of gold." It was
<PB N="11" REF="033394_0009_0FF6DF85C4D7AB78">
then in the height of its &s;plendor and glory; and the imperial city was emphatically called, the "golden city." The &s;ame empire was &s;ignified by the lion with eagle's wings, in the 7th chapter. It was overthrown before Daniel's death, by Cy|rus, then general, and afterward king of the Medes and Per&s;ians.</P>
<P>THE &s;ilver brea&s;t and arms of the image repre|&s;ented the kingdom of the Medes and Per&s;ians; which &s;ucceeded the Babylonian monarchy. This was &s;ignified to Daniel, under the figure of a bear, with three ribs in his mouth, in the 7th chapter, and afterward of a ram with two horns, in the 8th chapter.</P>
<P>THE brazen belly and thighs &s;ignified the Mace|donian empire, conducted by Alexander, and con|tinued by his four &s;ucce&s;&s;ors. This an&s;wered to the leopard with four heads and four wings, in the 7th chapter, and to the goat, fir&s;t with one horn, and afterward with four horns, in the 8th chapter.</P>
<P>THESE three empires, the Babylonian, the Medo-Per&s;ian and the Macedonian, have long &s;ince given place to the fourth, the Roman empire; which is meant by the iron legs and feet of the image, and by its ten toes, which were partly of iron and partly of clay. The &s;ame power is figured by the bea&s;t with great iron teeth, in the 7th chapter, and the little horn of the goat, which waxed great, in the 8th chapter. It is al&s;o repre&s;ented in the Rev|elation of John by a bea&s;t with &s;even heads and ten horns. It is ob&s;ervable, that this empire is de|&s;cribed in the vi&s;ion of Nebuchadnezzar in a three-fold &s;tate, 1. by the thighs and legs, which were
<PB N="12" REF="033394_0010_0FF6DF8811F64C10">
entirely of iron; 2. by the feet, which were of iron and clay; and, 3. by the toes, which were of the &s;ame materials; and this three-fold view corre&s;ponds exactly with the events which have taken place. For the Roman empire was at fir&s;t &s;trong and terrible. Whil&s;t the &s;pirit of true lib|erty animated their con&s;titution: Whil&s;t public virtue and genuine patrioti&s;m were the ruling principles, their councils were firm, and their arms were victorious. They conquered the neighbour|ing countries, and diffu&s;ed the &s;pirit of their con|&s;titution wherever they made a conque&s;t. This was the fir&s;t and be&s;t &s;tate of the Romans. But after a while, they grew intoxicated with &s;ucce&s;s, and degenerated from their manly fortitude into luxury and plea&s;ure. Then the &s;pirit of corrup|tion crept into the body politic, and it became, as the prophet repre&s;ents it in its &s;econd &s;tage, like a mixture of iron and clay. It was divided into two parts, viz. the Ea&s;tern and We&s;tern empire; the &s;eat of the former was Con&s;tantinople, and of the latter, Rome. There was, however, &s;omething of the &s;trength of iron. They were &s;till a powerful and formidable people. The northern nations who invaded and incorporated them&s;elves with the Ro|mans, in the &s;econd &s;tage of the empire, brought with them a &s;pirit of liberty, which the Romans had lo&s;t; but &s;o di&s;tracted were they with inte&s;tine quarrels and religious controver&s;ies, that, like iron and clay, they never could be thoroughly blended; and the&s;e cau&s;es operated to produce the third &s;tage of the empire, its divi&s;ion into ten kingdoms; an&s;wering to the ten toes of the image and the ten horns of John's bea&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="033394_0011_0FF6DF89AE273368">THIS &s;eparation of the empire took place be|tween eight and nine hundred years ago; and though &s;ome of the kingdoms have in &s;ome degree been changed, and mixed, yet there has been ever &s;ince, &s;uch a di&s;tinction kept up, that there has generally been about the number of ten.</P>
<P>IN the days of the&s;e kings, (as Daniel foretold) i. e. the Roman empire, the God of Heaven did &s;et up a fifth kingdom, prefigured by a &s;tone, cut out of a mountain, without hands. This was the kingdom of Je&s;us Chri&s;t; and as long as the di|vided remains of the Roman empire &s;hall &s;ub&s;i&s;t, this kingdom will be, as it has hitherto been, in the &s;tate repre&s;ented by the prophets, as "a &s;tone of &s;tumbling and rock of offence"; but in due time it will &s;mite the image on its feet and break it to pieces; and will it&s;elf become a great moun|tain and fill the whole earth. This grand event was &s;ignified to Daniel in other vi&s;ions, recorded in the 7th and 12th chapters; and it is more par|ticularly de&s;cribed in the three la&s;t chapters of the book of John's revelation.</P>
<P>IF it be inquired, why were the&s;e four empires made the &s;ubject of divine prophecy in preference to all the other kingdoms of this world? The an|&s;wer is, that all of them were in&s;truments, in the hands of God, to carry on the de&s;igns of his pro|vidence toward the Jewi&s;h people fir&s;t, and ulti|mately the kingdom of his SON. The vi&s;ion is a kind of prophetic chronology, to point out the time when the kingdom of God &s;hould come, or be vi&s;ibly and permanently e&s;tabli&s;hed. The rea|&s;on why the&s;e four empires only are di&s;tingui&s;hed
<PB N="14" REF="033394_0012_0FF6DF8C0AD0A570">
by the &s;pirit of prophecy, was, not becau&s;e they were greater or more remarkable than &s;ome oth|ers; but, becau&s;e the cour&s;e of their hi&s;tory is con|nected with that of the Jewi&s;h church, and led in a regular and direct &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the time and reign of Je&s;us Chri&s;t.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hurd's Introduction to the &s;tudy of prophecy, p. 80.</NOTE> An an&s;wer of the &s;ame kind may be given, if it be a&s;ked, why was this revelation made to a Gentile king? This Gentile king was connected with the Jews, and was oblig|ed to a Jewi&s;h prophet for recovering and inter|preting his dream; and the only record of it is pre&s;erved in the Library of the Jewi&s;h church, to whom were committed the oracles of God. It is therefore a prophecy which comes to us in the &s;ame channel with all the other in&s;pired prophecies, and has the &s;ame end in view, to te&s;tify of Je&s;us Chri&s;t; for the te&s;timony of or concerning him is the &s;pirit of prophecy, and to him give all the prophets witne&s;s. If the facts recorded corre&s;pond with the things foretold; if the prophecy coincide with the whole &s;eries of prophecy, having the &s;ame object in view, and this object be, what none but God could know, before the event; then it will follow, that the in&s;piration is real, and there is a further evidence of the divinity of the revelations contained in the Old and New Te&s;taments.</P>
<P>FROM the explication which has now been given of this &s;acred prophetic vi&s;ion, we may &s;ee, that the pre&s;ent period of time, pointed out by it, is that which was &s;ignified by the ten toes of the image. The ten kingdoms, into which the Ro|man empire was divided, are &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;ting, though
<PB N="15" REF="033394_0013_0FF6DF8F018F23B0">
under different forms of government; and though the divi&s;ion be different from what it was at fir&s;t; and they are all, more or le&s;s, in the &s;tate in which the vi&s;ion repre&s;ents them, a mixture of iron and clay, of &s;trength and weakne&s;s; they are partly &s;trong and partly broken, they do not cleave to one another even as iron is not mixed with clay. None of them ever have been able, though &s;ome of them have attempted, to render them&s;elves equally &s;trong and terrible as the ancient Roman empire was in its fir&s;t &s;tage.</P>
<P>YOU will plea&s;e to take notice, that the&s;e ten kingdoms comprehend the we&s;tern part of the continent of Europe, once the we&s;tern empire of Rome; among the&s;e, the countries &s;ubject to the dominion of <HI>Britain</HI> and <HI>France</HI> hold a di&s;tingui&s;hed rank; and as the&s;e are the principal ones, with which we ever had, or now have any political con|nexion; &s;o I &s;hall confine my ob&s;ervations chiefly to them; though the &s;ame prophetic characters are equally applicable to Spain, Italy, Germany, and the other divi&s;ions of the we&s;tern empire. The&s;e are the toes of the image; in which may be clearly di&s;cerned the materials of which they are com|po&s;ed, iron and clay, &s;trength and weakne&s;s, wi&s;|dom and folly; &s;ometimes the one has prevailed, and &s;ometimes the other; but there has been no union among them; all the attempts to unite them, &s;o as to make a grand, formidable empire, re&s;embling that of ancient Rome, have hitherto failed of &s;ucce&s;s; and from the &s;ure word of pro|phecy we have the &s;tronge&s;t rea&s;on to conclude, that they will always remain in the &s;ame divided &s;tate,
<PB N="16" REF="033394_0014_0FF6DF914D0C1680">
till the kingdom of Je&s;us Chri&s;t &s;hall break them all to pieces, and &s;hall ri&s;e upon their ruins.</P>
<P>THE <HI>iron</HI> part of the&s;e toes, or the &s;trength and power of the&s;e divi&s;ions of the Roman empire, may be con&s;idered as con&s;i&s;ting in the numbers of their people, the vigour, activity and di&s;cipline of their land and naval forces; their wealth, ari&s;ing from their hu&s;bandry, manufactures, commerce and the management of their finances; the great fertility and high cultivation of their lands, their progre&s;s in arts and &s;ciences, their maritime and in&s;ular &s;it|uations, and the great natural advantages which they enjoy, of which their &s;agacity and their in|tere&s;t lead them to make the mo&s;t rapid and &s;uc|ce&s;sful improvement; to which they are farther urged by the &s;pirit of jealou&s;y and rival&s;hip, always attending commercial nations. When the&s;e powers are put into action by fierce pa&s;&s;ions and by &s;kilful leaders, they make a formidable appearance, and threaten one another, or the neighbouring nations, with conque&s;t; and it is not &s;urpri&s;ing if they are in &s;ome mea&s;ure &s;ucce&s;sful.</P>
<P>BUT if we view the <HI>clay</HI> part of their character, we &s;hall find that they are not quite &s;o terrible as &s;ome are apt to imagine. The great abilities and re&s;ources which they po&s;&s;e&s;s are counterbalanced by the prevalence of corruption, venality and pro|fu&s;ion; by the luxury and effeminacy which com|merce generally produces, and the unbounded ap|petite for plea&s;ure which pervades all ranks and orders of the people. We &s;hall find in &s;ome of them a &s;pirit of faction, a want of firmne&s;s and con|&s;i&s;tency, a thir&s;t for power, and wealth, a re|volutionary
<PB N="17" REF="033394_0015_0FF6DF92EFBE32D0">
phrenzy, operating to produce a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ina|tions, robbery and plunder. Under a pretence of republican liberty, we have &s;een &s;ome of them ex|erci&s;ing the mo&s;t boundle&s;s licentiou&s;ne&s;s and wan|ton de&s;poti&s;m, in defiance of ju&s;tice, humanity, policy, morality and religion. The &s;ame crimes have &s;tained their character when profe&s;&s;ing liberty and equality as when &s;ounding the prai&s;es of their kings. The &s;ame tyranny, the &s;ame pro&s;criptions, impri&s;onments, bani&s;hments and wa&s;te of human life, have di&s;graced the annals of republicani&s;m as of monarchy; and their national character, in&s;tead of being meliorated, is, if po&s;&s;ible, degenerated by their revolutions; for &s;laves, when made free, are the wor&s;t of tyrants.</P>
<P>THINK not, my Brethren, that what I &s;ay is dic|tated by pa&s;&s;ion or party-&s;pirit. I &s;peak the words of truth and &s;oberne&s;s. This &s;ubject has been fa|miliar to me above twenty years. It was in the beginning of the third year of our revolutionary war,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">May, 1777.</NOTE> when we had no friend nor ally but Heaven, to &s;hield us from the vengeance of Britain, and when &s;he was making her greate&s;t efforts to &s;ubdue us, that my thoughts were directed to this prophecy; and upon an attentive contemplation of it, with the be&s;t helps<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The works of Jo&s;eph Mede, Sir I&s;aac Newton, and Dr. Thomas Newton.</NOTE> that I could obtain, I found in it, &s;ufficient encouragement to re&s;t my hope, that the formidable power, then at war with us, would not prevail. The confidence which I had did not prove to be vain; but as I thought there was &s;ufficient ground for con&s;olation in the
<PB N="18" REF="033394_0016_0FF6DF95409B1720">
height of our di&s;tre&s;s, and when no human help was engaged on our &s;ide; &s;o the conclu&s;ion of the war ju&s;tified the expectation.</P>
<P>THERE was a time, about thirty-five years ago,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1763.</NOTE> when Great-Britain had a much fairer pro&s;pect of an exten&s;ive and growing empire, than France has now. Her dominions were then indeed &s;cattered over all quarters of the world, but united in allegi|ance to one &s;overeign, the political head of a wealthy, powerful and commercial nation; and had he known how to improve the advantages, which Providence had put into his hands, he might have been one of the riche&s;t and noble&s;t princes on the face of the earth. Had the true &s;pirit of lib|erty and patrioti&s;m, which made old Rome &s;o re|&s;pectable, been the ruling &s;pirit of the Briti&s;h gov|ernment, it might, according to human probabili|ty, have rivalled or exceeded Rome in &s;plendor. But Britain, intoxicated with glory and proud of &s;ucce&s;s, thinking her triumphant flag &s;uperior to all the world, ventured on the mad project of quar|relling with her be&s;t friends, and en&s;laving this country. In&s;tead of the &s;ilken reins, which always mo&s;t effectually govern, becau&s;e &s;carcely felt, &s;he began to forge iron chains for free Americans. By endeavoring to extend the &s;pirit of corruption and &s;catter the &s;eeds of de&s;poti&s;m to the remote parts of her dominions, &s;he rou&s;ed in us the &s;pirit of genuine liberty, a &s;pirit which is always uncontrol|able; and then by u&s;ing force to quell it, &s;he ef|fectually weakened her own power, and proved to all the world that &s;he was nothing but a mixture of <HI>iron and clay.</HI> The &s;pirit of liberty and the &s;pirit
<PB N="19" REF="033394_0017_0FF6DF9834AC1D98">
of de&s;poti&s;m can never unite, but will be in per|petual oppo&s;ition; and the&s;e two principles, after a long and violent &s;truggle, produced a &s;eparation, by which the prediction was in one in&s;tance ful|filled, "they &s;hall not cleave one to another, even as iron is not mixed with clay." This &s;eparation and the e&s;tabli&s;hment of our independence, were the re&s;ult of cau&s;es, fore&s;een and foretold by Him, to whom all his works, and all the operations of inferior agents, are perfectly known from the be|ginning of the world. All the wi&s;dom of &s;tate&s;|men, all the eloquence of orators, and all the &s;trength and power of fleets and armies could not counteract the decree of Heaven, that America mu&s;t be &s;eparated from Britain. From the experience which we have had of her conduct, it is my mo&s;t earne&s;t wi&s;h, and from our own increa&s;ing power and re&s;ources and the wi&s;dom and &s;tability of our pre&s;ent government, it is my confident expectation, that the &s;eparation will ever remain, and that we &s;hall be an independent people, fully equal to the bu&s;ine&s;s of governing our&s;elves, without any for|eign interference whatever. If there be any per|&s;ons among us who are for re-uniting us with Great-Britain, I hold their political principles in as much abhorrence as tho&s;e who are for &s;ubjecting us to the influence of France; for I dete&s;t the thought, that any rotten toe of Nebuchadnezzar's image, or any proud horn of the &s;even-headed bea&s;t, &s;hould ever exerci&s;e dominion over this country.</P>
<P>IT is curious and amu&s;ing, as well as in&s;tructive, to ob&s;erve, how nearly the conduct of France to|ward
<PB N="20" REF="033394_0018_0FF6778BC16CD670">
us, in the pre&s;ent controver&s;y, re&s;embles that of Britain in a former controver&s;y; and how the &s;ame kind of language is u&s;ed by the emi&s;&s;a|ries of the one as was then held by the minions of the other. The quarrel between Britain and us was not of our &s;eeking, but their own; we were their friends and cu&s;tomers; and had they let us alone, we &s;hould have remained &s;o probably to this day. So the controver&s;y between France and us is not of our &s;eeking, but we have been forced into it by them&s;elves. We have not intended them any injury; we have not invaded their country, nor captured their property, either by &s;ea or land; we have not intermeddled with their interior gov|ernment, nor &s;ought to alienate the people of France from their rulers. We rejoiced in what we &s;uppo&s;ed was their emancipation; and we hoped, in the fir&s;t &s;tage of their revolution, that they would &s;o limit and re&s;train the power of their princes and nobility, and &s;o reform the abu&s;es of their government, as to enjoy a degree of freedom to which they had been &s;trangers, ever &s;ince the elevation of the Bourbon family. We were as friendly toward the people of France as ever we were toward the people of Britain before they be|gan the quarrel with us. But when it was begun, we were hectored and threatned, by the proud language of affected &s;uperiority. In the one ca&s;e, our ears were dinned with the &s;upremacy and om|nipotence of the Briti&s;h parliament, with the pomp|ous parade of their former victories, and the tri|umphant flouri&s;h of their flag over the four quar|ters of the world. In the other ca&s;e, we are told
<PB N="21" REF="033394_0019_0FF6DF9C290CD1D0">
that France is generous to her friends, but terrible to her enemies; we hear of the invincible arms of the republic, one and indivi&s;ible; we are point|ed to the fate of Venice as an example of republi|can vengeance; and we are warned by the medi|tated conque&s;t of Switzerland and the inva&s;ion of Britain, what we are to expect, if we do not buy our peace of the terrible republic. So Sennach|erib, king of A&s;&s;yria, threatned Jeru&s;alem in the days of Hezekiah; and &s;o Phillip of Spain, with his invincible armada, menaced the i&s;land of Brit|ain in the days of Elizabeth!</P>
<P>TO &s;ecure a party in our country, the govern|ment of Britain once maintained a &s;warm of crown officers with pen&s;ions and places; and tempted our mo&s;t wealthy citizens with the hope of prefer|ment; and then boa&s;ted of the &s;trength of their influence over us. Ju&s;t &s;o the French government is boa&s;ting of the influence which they have in this country, and of their power to control our coun|cils, to divide the people from the government, and effect a revolution in their own favor.</P>
<P>TO pre&s;erve our connexion with Great-Britain, and prevent a &s;eparation from her, we &s;ent the mo&s;t re&s;pectful petitions, which were treated with neglect and contempt by the &s;overeign and his mini&s;ters. So the pre&s;ent ruling powers of France have refu&s;ed to hear our envoys, when &s;oliciting for an audience to repre&s;ent our grievances and lo&s;&s;es. When we entered into a treaty with France, to a&s;&s;i&s;t us in &s;upporting our indepen|dence,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1778.</NOTE> and would not be diverted from it by the flatteries or intrigues of Britain, they were incen&s;ed

again&s;t us, and made the war more &s;anguinary and de&s;tructive. So, when we had made a treaty with Britain,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1795.</NOTE> to recover our property unju&s;tly taken away, and the French have found that we will not break our faith, they are come out in vengeance again&s;t us, and are forcibly taking our property and ruining, as far as they are able, our commerce.</P>
<P>WHEN the&s;e &s;imilar circum&s;tances are con&s;ider|ed, mu&s;t we not conclude that both the&s;e rival and contending nations have no true regard for us; that they have no generous and magnanimous prin|ples of action; but are both governed by the &s;ame intere&s;ted, narrow, &s;elfi&s;h policy, and that neither of them de&s;erve our confidence any farther than the maxims of that kind of policy will permit. There is an old rule of common prudence, which will apply as well to nations as to individuals;</P>
<L>"In things of moment, on <HI>thy&s;elf</HI> depend;</L>
<L>Tru&s;t not too far thy &s;ervant nor thy friend."</L>
<P>And this very &s;entiment, though expre&s;&s;ed in bet|ter language, was the advice of our great and good WASHINGTON, when he retired from office.</P>
<P>"THE great rule of conduct (&s;aid he) for us, in regard to foreign nations, is to have as little <HI>polit|ical</HI> connexion with them as po&s;&s;ible. Europe has a &s;et of intere&s;ts, which to us have none, or a very remote relation; it mu&s;t therefore be unwi&s;e in us to implicate our&s;elves in the vici&s;&s;itudes of her politics, or the combinations and colli&s;ions of her friend&s;hips or enmities. It is our true policy to &s;teer clear of permanent alliances with any portion of the foreign world. As far as we have already
<PB N="23" REF="033394_0021_0FF6DFA16FD3E580">
formed engagements, let them be fulfilled with good faith. But it is unnece&s;&s;ary, and would be unwi&s;e, to extend them."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See his Addre&s;s to the people, p. 35.</NOTE></P>
<P>THIS is the advice of a man who thoroughly under&s;tood, and wi&s;ely pur&s;ued, the true intere&s;t of his country. Of his &s;ucce&s;&s;or we ought to have the &s;ame opinion; for from above thirty years ex|perience he has been known and proved to be one of our mo&s;t enlightened and &s;teady friends.</P>
<P>FROM the foregoing ob&s;ervations, we clearly &s;ee what are the prophetic characters of tho&s;e Europe|an nations, which are repre&s;ented by the ten toes of Nebuchadnezzar's image and the ten horns of the apocalyptic bea&s;t. It is both &s;urpri&s;ing and edifying to all &s;tudious chri&s;tians to &s;ee how plainly and exactly the picture is drawn by the in&s;pired pen, and how rapidly events are coming on, which bear &s;o near a re&s;emblance to the accompli&s;hment of the prophecies. It was foretold that an antichri&s;tian power would ari&s;e and rule over the nations. This we have been u&s;ed to interpret of the papal &s;over|eignty; the combination of wealth and power with a corrupt form of Chri&s;tianity, to en&s;lave the bodies and &s;ouls of men; and doubtle&s;s the inter|pretation is ju&s;t. But as the Scripture a&s;&s;ures us "there are many antichri&s;ts," &s;o we &s;hould extend our idea of this power to comprehend all that op|po&s;eth and exalteth it&s;elf again&s;t the pure religion of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. It is very evident that the French nation was one of the firme&s;t &s;upporters of the papal u&s;urpation, and that its former government an&s;wered to the prophetic character of one of tho&s;e "kings which gave their power and &s;trength to
<PB N="24" REF="033394_0022_0FF6DFA3109FF758">
the bea&s;t."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rev. xvii.13.</NOTE> But it was al&s;o foretold, that there very kings, the &s;ame antichri&s;tian powers, &s;hould "hate the whore, and make her de&s;olate and na|ked, and eat her fle&s;h and burn her with fire;"<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ver&s;e 16.</NOTE> and do we not &s;ee this remarkable prediction in a fair way of being fulfilled? The French power is not the le&s;s antichri&s;tian for the revolution. It is, in another &s;hape, directly oppo&s;ed to Chri&s;tianity, as well to the corrupt forms of it as to its purity. The kingdom of Satan, at pre&s;ent, appears to be divided again&s;t it&s;elf; how then &s;hall his kingdom &s;tand?</P>
<P>WHEN the &s;pirit of God foretels future events, he does not pre&s;cribe what ought to be done, but relates beforehand what will be done. His fore|&s;eeing and foretelling the&s;e events does not ju&s;tify the means which are to be made u&s;e of to bring them into effect. Wicked men may do many bad things, which may &s;erve to bring on what is fore|told in the divinely in&s;pired writings; and yet the&s;e very men may be proper &s;ubjects of puni&s;h|ment for the&s;e actions. An in&s;tance of this we have in the king of A&s;&s;yria, to whom the prophet I&s;aiah makes this memorable addre&s;s; "O A&s;&s;yri|an, the rod of mine anger and the &s;taff in their hand is mine indignation. I will &s;end him again&s;t an hypocritical nation, and will give him a charge to take the &s;poil and the prey and to tread them down as the mire of the &s;treets. Howbeit, he meaneth not &s;o, neither doth his heart think &s;o; but it is in his heart to de&s;troy and cut off nations not a few. Wherefore it &s;hall come to pa&s;s, when the Lord hath performed his whole work on
<PB N="25" REF="033394_0023_0FF6DFA578A743F0">
Mount Zion, and on Jeru&s;alem, I will puni&s;h the &s;tout heart of the king of A&s;&s;yria, and the glory of his high looks."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I&s;aiah x.5&mdash;7, 12.</NOTE></P>
<P>WE mu&s;t not then think it &s;trange or unaccount|able that tho&s;e very men, who are in&s;trumental of bringing on revolutions, predicted in the word of God, &s;hould them&s;elves be guilty of the mo&s;t atrocious crimes, and influenced by no motives but tho&s;e of violence, rapine and de&s;truction; that they &s;hould ca&s;t off all fear of God, and even deny his exi&s;tence; for bad as they are, they may be proper in&s;truments, in the hand of God, to puni&s;h other bad men; to pull down thrones of iniquity; to overturn monarchies which have been &s;upported by ambition and blood&s;hed; to de&s;troy hierarchies which have been founded in pride and prie&s;tcraft, and maintained by &s;uper&s;tition and per&s;ecution. From what other &s;ort of per&s;ons could &s;uch revo|lutions be expected? People of &s;ober and rational principles would not be guilty of a violent attack on the e&s;tabli&s;hed religions of any nation; they would content them&s;elves with enjoying the lib|erty of their own con&s;ciences in peace. But &s;uch convul&s;ions are to be expected, only from tho&s;e who are inflamed by the mo&s;t malignant pa&s;&s;ions, and influenced by the zeal of fanatici&s;m, either in religion or politicks, who have a rage for conque&s;t and plunder, and who &s;et no bounds to their am|bition and fury.</P>
<P>WHEN the great de&s;igns which God has deter|mined to accompli&s;h, by the in&s;trumentality of &s;uch agents, &s;hall be fulfilled; when things &s;hall be
<PB N="26" REF="033394_0024_0FF6DFA7CA763CE8">
prepared, in the cour&s;e of Providence, for the final de&s;truction of all that rule, authority and power, which, under whatever name or appearance, hath oppo&s;ed it&s;elf again&s;t the kingdom of Chri&s;t; then &s;hall be brought to pa&s;s that great event, which is repre&s;ented in the vi&s;ion by the &s;tone, &s;miting the image on its feet, and reducing it to du&s;t. Then all the&s;e kingdoms, the&s;e powers, which have &s;o di&s;turbed and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed the world, will vani&s;h like chaff before the wind, and the gentle, peaceful kingdom of the SON of David will be gradually, but univer&s;ally e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>
<P>THIS kingdom, my brethren, is &s;et up among us, and we profe&s;s to be the &s;ubjects of it. For its increa&s;e and enlargement, it is our duty to pray; and one of the petitions in our Lord's admirable form of prayer is, "Thy kingdom come." If we are &s;incere in uttering this prayer, we &s;hould accompany it with our endeavours to promote it. This will be the be&s;t way of expre&s;&s;ing our grati|tude to God for &s;o di&s;tingui&s;hing a favor.</P>
<P>IF it be a&s;ked, how &s;hall we do any thing toward promoting the kingdom of God in the world? I would an&s;wer, there are many ways in which we may do it, and &s;ome per&s;ons may be able to do more than others; but there is one way in which we may all do &s;omething, and perhaps this is the be&s;t way in which any of us can promote it; I mean by our example. Let your light &s;o &s;hine before men that they may &s;ee your good works, and glorify your Father in Heaven. There is nothing more forcible than example; like the
<PB N="27" REF="033394_0025_0FF6DFAAC781EBB8">
magnet, it draws with a &s;ecret and &s;ilent, yet pow|erful influence. It is often more effectual than po&s;itive precepts and penal laws. Multitudes are &s;wayed by it, who are not to be governed by any other means. It is in every man's power to do good in this way; and therefore it is every man's duty to &s;et a good example, to let every per&s;on with whom he is conver&s;ant, &s;ee that he is under the influence of Chri&s;tian principles and pro&s;pects; that he is &s;incerely &s;erving God, and committing the keeping of his &s;oul to him in well-doing. It is impo&s;&s;ible to conceive how much good may be done by our example. It may do good after we are dead. The remembrance of what we have been, and what we have done, may long outlive us, and unborn po&s;terity may be the better for it. In this re&s;pect, then, every per&s;on has a degree of importance annexed to his character, and every per&s;on ought to u&s;e that importance and that in|fluence for the noble&s;t purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>AND what nobler purpo&s;e can we &s;erve than that for which Chri&s;t died? This purpo&s;e is ac|compli&s;hing, though by &s;low degrees; and Chri&s;|tianity, in its whole progre&s;s, is marked with peace on earth and good will to men. Wherever it is known and practi&s;ed, mankind are the better for it; but wherever it is denied and rejected, they are the wor&s;e. Chri&s;tianity, when rightly known and regarded, has made men a&s;hamed of many enormities which they before practi&s;ed. It has abated the horrors of war, and introduced a &s;pirit of philanthropy into that de&s;tructive &s;cience. It
<PB N="28" REF="033394_0026_0FF6DFAD18A5E7F0">
has reformed the legal and judicial &s;y&s;tems, and taught le&s;s &s;everity and milder methods of reclaim|ing offenders, than were before known; it has, in &s;ome ca&s;es, mitigated, and in others extingui&s;hed, the evil of &s;ervitude, and taught men a &s;en&s;e of equal freedom. It has &s;hed its genial influence on government, and taught us, in this highly favored land, how to cru&s;h rebellions and e&s;tabli&s;h con|&s;titutions, without violence or blood&s;hed.</P>
<P>HAPPY influence, ble&s;&s;ed &s;pirit of true religion! This is the way in which the kingdoms of this world will be &s;o &s;ubdued, as to become the kingdoms of our Lord and Saviour Je&s;us Chri&s;t. The con|que&s;ts of the Son of God are effected not by force of the &s;word, but by the &s;ecret energy of truth; not by might nor power, but by the divine &s;pirit. By &s;uch means, and by none el&s;e, will true religion prevail, till the kingdom of Chri&s;t &s;hall become univer&s;al.</P>
<P>MAY we ever be governed by the mild and peaceful dictates of the go&s;pel! May it go on from conquering to conquer, till it &s;hall have eradicated war, &s;lavery, oppre&s;&s;ion, tyranny, &s;uper&s;tition and vice; till antichri&s;tian power and influence &s;hall be aboli&s;hed; till fal&s;e religion, fal&s;e philo&s;ophy and de&s;potic government &s;hall be de&s;troyed; till love and peace &s;hall reign, and truth and righteou&s;|ne&s;s &s;hall be e&s;tabli&s;hed in the earth.</P>
<P>IF we believe the &s;criptures, we mu&s;t expect, that the&s;e ble&s;&s;ings will be be&s;towed on the world, before the plan of Divine Providence &s;hall be com|pleted; and therefore we may pray in faith,
<PB N="29" REF="033394_0027_0FF6DFAEE9BA7308">
grounded on the divine promi&s;es, for the accom|pli&s;hment of the&s;e predictions. The pro&s;pect is in the highe&s;t degree plea&s;ant to all the &s;incere lovers of God and man. Whil&s;t, therefore, we are look|ing, praying and waiting for the&s;e glorious times, let us learn to anticipate them, as far as we are able, by cultivating in our own minds and conduct, tho&s;e heavenly graces and virtues, which &s;hall prove us the true &s;ubjects of Chri&s;t, and prepare us for the univer&s;al reign of the Prince of peace.</P>
