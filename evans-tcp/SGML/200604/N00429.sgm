<HEAD>Conclusion. 1.</HEAD>
<P><HI>[My Transgression]</HI> The Hebrew word for it Notes, <HI>a Transgression out of Pride:</HI> And my Conclusion from it is,</P>
<P><HI>There is a wicked and a cursed Pride in the Sins of men.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>First</HI> of our sin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> was founded in a cursed <HI>Pride,</HI> &amp; the <HI>most</HI> of our Sins are tainted with it. The first sin of <HI>Adam</HI> had <HI>Pride</HI> for a main ingredient of it. It was propounded unto him, in <HI>Gen.</HI> 3.5. <HI>Ye shall be as Gods,</HI> Honour and Grandeur was the Bait which he was taken with, and his <HI>Pride</HI> affected a higher condition that that which his
<PB N="10" REF="000539_0016_0FA6B524C841CCD0">
Maker had plac'd him in. The first Sin of <HI>Satan</HI> too had P<HI>ride</HI> for its Original. Hence we are advised in I Tim 3 6. he that is <HI>lifted up with pride, falls into the condemnation of the Divel.</HI> It is thought that his Dissatisfaction at some Privi|ledges, which he foresaw Mankind likely to be the subject of, was that which prompted him to the Rebellion and Apostasie, in which he is now <HI>King over the children of pride.</HI> Tis thus in all the <HI>Sins</HI> which <HI>those</HI> have been the Parents of; there lies <HI>Pride</HI> at the bottom of them all. What <HI>So|lomon</HI> sayes of one Sin, <HI>Only by Pride comes contention;</HI> the like may be said of All Sin, <HI>Mainly by Pride comes Transgression.</HI> Upon the Root of <HI>Pride</HI> it is, that there grows all the Disobedi|ence to God, which is at any time com|mitted in the World. It was the Say|ing of the Prophet, in <HI>Jer.</HI> 13.17. <HI>If ye will not hear, my soul shall weep in se|cret Places for your pride.</HI> From our <HI>Pride</HI> it is, that we do not <HI>Hear</HI> the voice of God unto us in his <HI>Ordinances</HI>
<PB N="11" REF="000539_0017_0FA6B5258433F550">
or in His P<HI>rovidences;</HI> Tis P<HI>ride</HI> that makes us thick of <HI>Hearing,</HI> when our God councels us to <HI>Do Justice and have Mercy, and walk Humbly with Him:</HI> Every <HI>Sin</HI> (as one sayes of every <HI>man</HI>) hath a P<HI>ope</HI> in the <HI>Belly</HI> of it; some|thing that <HI>Exalts it self against all that is called GOD.</HI> The Sinners whom <HI>Solomon</HI> calls <HI>the Fools,</HI> are those whom <HI>David</HI> calls the <HI>proud.</HI> If men were not <HI>proud Fools</HI> they would never es|pouse a way <HI>of wickedness;</HI> men Sin with an <HI>High</HI> Heart, and that makes them Sin with an <HI>High Hand</HI> against the God of Heaven.

<P>[<HI>My Iniquity</HI>] The Hebrew Word for it imports <HI>Iniquity</HI> with <HI>Crookedness</HI> and <HI>Perverseness.</HI> And hence I <HI>form</HI> this Conclusion.</P>
<P><HI>The Sins of Men have a World of unrighteous Crookedness</HI> &amp; <HI>Pervers|ness in them.</HI></P>
<P>Our Sins are not <HI>Right</HI> Things, but there is a most uncomely <HI>Obliquity</HI> in all of our <HI>Iniquity.</HI> Every Sinner may say, as in <HI>Job.</HI> 33.27.

<P>Whence this Conclusion doth arise</P>
<P><HI>In Justification, the Burden of Sin is Translated from the Sinner unto the Lord Jesus Christ.</HI></P>
<P>Sin is an Heavy <HI>Burden</HI> upon the Soul which it lies upon; and the Sin|ner may justly roar under it, as in Psal. 38. 4. <HI>My Iniquities, as an heavy Burden, are too heavy for me.</HI> Hence, <HI>The Bearing of Iniquity,</HI> is a phrase that sometimes occurrs in the Book of God: Every sensible Soul, feels it like a pon|derous Mountain of Lead upon him; the Thousands of Talents which he owes unto the Revenge of God, are a <HI>Weight</HI> upon him, which he finds there is no Enduring of.

And thus we are told in Isa. 53.6. <HI>God hath laid on him the Iniquity of us all.</HI> The <HI>Burden</HI> of Sin, is the Obligation to make Satisfaction for it; this is a <HI>Burden</HI> enough to Break the Backs of all the Angels in Hea|ven, if it were laid upon them.

<P>Sin is <HI>passed by,</HI> and made to <HI>pass away,</HI> when it is <HI>Forgiven</HI> to us.

<HEAD>Conclusion 5.</HEAD>
<P>It is observed, that the same words [<HI>Transgression,</HI> and <HI>Iniquity</HI>] are used both for <HI>Sin</HI> it self, and for the <HI>pu|nishment</HI> of Sin.</P>
<P>Wherefore I shall here tender you this one Conclusion more.</P>
<P><HI>In Justification, the severe punishment of Sin, is Remitted, with the Fault it self.</HI></P>

<P>For answer to this, Let these three <HI>Conclusions,</HI> all found in the Text, be laid together.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="conclusion">
<HEAD>Conclusion I.</HEAD>
<P><HI>None can Forgive Sins, bit God.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Scribes</HI> of old were so far <HI>Well Instructed,</HI> as to say, in Marc.2.7. <HI>Who can Forgive Sin, but God only?</HI> The true. Answer is very short; <HI>None Injuries</HI> done to men, may so far be forgiven by <HI>Men,</HI> as men only are con|cerned in them. Hence 'tis among the solemn Charges of the Lord Jesus, to us all; in Mat. 6. 14. <HI>Forgive men their Trespasses.</HI> But as it was of old said, <HI>If a Man sin against the Lord, who shall entreat for him?</HI> Even so <HI>If a man sin against the LORD; who shall pardon him?</HI> Injuries done to God, are to be Forgiven by <HI>Him</HI> alone, whose Great Name is that in Exod. 34. 7. <HI>The Lord Forgiving Iniquity, and Transgression, and Sin.</HI> It is a Maxim, <HI>Nemo potest Remittere de Jure

Alieno;</HI> No man can dispose of A|nothers <HI>Right.</HI> Who then can <HI>I</HI>n|trude, or dare Invade upon the Great God, so as to allow for a <HI>Wrong</HI> which has been done unto <HI>His</HI> Majesty? To <HI>Forgive Sin,</HI> is a prerogative peculiar to the God of Heaven; and it is therefore mention'd among His <HI>Rega|lia,</HI> in M c. 7 8. <HI>W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o is a God like unto thee, that pardoneth Iniquity?</HI> 'Tis one of His <HI>Incomparable</HI> Excellencies, and a Flower in His Glorious Crown; <HI>T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">is the Glory which He will not give unto another.</HI> Look upon sin as a <HI>Debt;</HI> still God is the <HI>Creditor;</HI> Look upon sin as a <HI>F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">uls;</HI> still God is the <HI>Gover|nour,</HI> to whom alone belongs the Re|mission of it. We are advertised of this, Rom 8. 33. <HI>It is God that Justi|fies Ministerially</HI> to <HI>Declare</HI> a Par|don, is one thing. This may be done by the <HI>Churches</HI> of the Lord Jesus Christ; as the Priests were to pro|nounce upon the <HI>Cleanness</HI> of the <HI>Le|per.</HI> In which respect our Lord said
<PB N="24" REF="000539_0030_0FA6B53A8F59CF40">
in <HI>John</HI> 20 23. <HI>Whose soever sins ye re|mit, they are remitted to them.</HI> And in such a sense was the Prophet <HI>Jeremiah</HI> to pull down and pluck up <HI>Nations;</HI> that was, to <HI>Declare</HI> what Nations were so to be dealt withal.</P>
<P>But <HI>Authoritatively</HI> to <HI>Dispense</HI> a Pardon, is another thing, and it per|tains to God alone. It was a passage <HI>of Moses,</HI> in <HI>Numb</HI> 14. 17. <HI>Let the power of my Lord be great</HI> [The <HI>Jews</HI> find a <HI>Letter</HI> of a greater figure than usual there, to intimate, they say, something of an extraordinary <HI>Greatness;</HI> but what is it? it follows] <HI>Pardon</HI> I <HI>beseech thee.</HI> None but one that has the <HI>great Power</HI> of a God can <HI>pardon</HI> Sin. The <HI>Popish</HI> Blasphemy and Villany upon this point, was the <HI>Scandal</HI> which first gave occasion to the Protestant Refor|mation; and God forbid that any <HI>Pro|testant</HI> should <HI>Return</HI> to lick it up.

<HEAD>Conclusion 2.</HEAD>
<P><HI>The God of Heaven requires our Im|portunate Prayers, that our Sins may be forgiven to us.</HI></P>
<P>Tis an Article in that <HI>Platform</HI> of Prayer; which our Lord has given us, O our <HI>Heavenly Father, Forgive us our Trespasses.</HI> When a certain Man had sinned at a grievous Rate, there was this Direction given to him, in <HI>Acts</HI> 8. 22. <HI>Repent of thy wickedness, and pray to God.</HI> And O that this Direction
<PB N="26" REF="000539_0032_0FA6B53DC291F968">
might penetrate into the very Soul of the sad man that is now before us here; a <HI>Man</HI> (if he be worthy to be called so) of whom we may say, <HI>O this Man hath sinned a great Sin!</HI> Behold, the course to be taken by every sinner, that would have a <HI>Pardon</HI> from the Lord; <HI>Pray to God, if perhaps thy sin may be forgiven thee.</HI> We have a pro|mise of a <HI>Pardon,</HI> in <HI>Ezek</HI> 36.25. I will <HI>sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall be clean.</HI> But what follows? <HI>Thus saith the Lord God, I will yet for this be en|quired of, to do it.</HI> We must <HI>enquire</HI> of God, and <HI>entreat</HI> of God; if we would not perish without a <HI>Pardon</HI> forever. There is no sign of a <HI>Pardon</HI> in any man, till it can be said of him, as in in <HI>Acts</HI> 9.11. <HI>Behold</HI> he <HI>Prayes!</HI> Tis in <HI>Prayer</HI> that we confess our Sins, 'tis in <HI>Prayer</HI> that we renounce our Sins, 'tis by <HI>Prayer</HI> that we cast all our Sins, upon the Lord Jesus Christ; and with|out this, the least Sin in the World is <HI>utterly unpardonable.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="000539_0033_0FA6B53E517A7CC0">
Even those that have been already <HI>Pardoned,</HI> are to continue <HI>praying</HI> for a Pardon still. Tis a thing which none among the <HI>Disciples</HI> of our Lord Jesus Christ, are to be excused from. They need the comfort of a Pardon to be sensibly Renewed unto them; and tho' it have been once told unto a <HI>David, The Lord has put away thy sin,</HI> yet he keeps praying still in the terms of the <HI>fifty first</HI> Psalm, a <HI>Prayer</HI> fitted for the lips of all that want a <HI>Pardon. Luther</HI> sometimes distinguished between a <HI>Se|cret pardon,</HI> &amp; an <HI>open pardon:</HI> a <HI>secret Pardon,</HI> every true Believer has, but an <HI>open Pardon</HI> implies an <HI>Assurance</HI> and <HI>Evidence</HI> of a <HI>Pardon,</HI> which many a Believer wants. Well, if we want <HI>Assurance,</HI> we are to pray that it may be <HI>vouchsafed;</HI> if we have <HI>Assurance,</HI> we are still to pray, that it be <HI>continned.</HI> A <HI>Prayer for a pardon</HI> is never out of Season.</P>

A P<HI>sychopannychia,</HI> a sleeping of the Soul on Death, is too gross and sad a thing to be imagined: it is it self, a <HI>Dream.</HI> The <HI>Active</HI> Apostle would never have said, as in <HI>Phil.</HI> 1. 23. <HI>I de|sire to be dislodged and be with Christ;</HI> if he should have had nothing to do but <HI>Sleep</HI> in the Lodging which he was thus desirous to go unto.

<P>The First <HI>Murtherer</HI> of his Neighbour in <HI>New-England</HI> (as I take it) was one <HI>Billington</HI> at <HI>Plimouth</HI> in the year 1630. He shott a poor man that he was a mor|tal enemy unto, &amp; expected that for want of <HI>Power</HI> or of <HI>People</HI> in that Infant Plan|tation he should have evaded the executi|on due to him for his Capital Offence. but Justice inflicted his deserved death upon him.</P>

Afterwards going to Service in <HI>Boston,</HI> she found her self to have conceived; but living with a favourable Mistriss, who would not allow any Suspicion or Suggestion of her <HI>Dis|honesty,</HI> and thinking her self unable to bear the shame or grief of the <HI>Discovery,</HI> she wholly concealed it until the Time of her <HI>Delivery.</HI> Being then alone by her self in a dark room she used violence to destroy the Child, <HI>once</HI> and <HI>again,</HI> before she effected the unnatural Barbarity.

that the observers had great Hopes of her true Repentance. But this was particularly remarkable, That as she acknowledged her <HI>Twice</HI> Essaying to kill her Infant before she could make an end of it; so, through the unskilfulness of the Hang-man, they were fain to turn her off the Ladder <HI>Twice</HI> before she could expire.</P>

<P>An English Ship sailing from some-where about the Mouth of the <HI>Streights,</HI> was manned with some cruel Miscreants, who quarrelling with the Master &amp; some of the Officers, turn'd them all into the <HI>Long-bont,</HI> with a small quantity of provisions, about an hundred Lengues to the westward of the Spanish Coast. These followes in the mean while saile for <HI>New-England,</HI> where as Providence would have it, the Master and his afflicted Company in the Long-boat arrived too; all except one who died of their Barbarous usage.

One speech let fall by him was, <HI>I have been a|mongst drawn swords, flying bullets, roaring Canons, amidst all which I never knew what fear meant; but now I have apprehensions of the dreadful wrath of God in the other world, which I am going into, my soul within me is a|mazed at it.</HI></P>

<P>A while since, there dyed at <HI>Lancaster,</HI> a man whose name was <HI>Richard Lenten,</HI> ar|rived in age to so many years above an hundred, That he had lived in Wedlock with his wise for <HI>Sixty three</HI> years, and yet she was <HI>Thirty five</HI> years younger than him|self;

and he was able to follow his toils at Husbandry, very livelily but about a <HI>month</HI> before his End.</P>
<P>This man had been all his dayes a poor ignorant carnal and sottish man, and un|acquainted with the very <HI>Principles</HI> of his <HI>Catechism,</HI> after he had satt under so ma|ny hundreds of Sermons as he had: Ne|vertheless, when he was about, <HI>an hundred years old,</HI> God blessed the Ministry of His Word unto this mans awakening; and he became a diligent Enquirer after the things of the life to come, and a Constant Serious Attender on all that was Religious. He arrived unto such measures of a well|informed Devotion, that the <HI>Church</HI> which was very strict in the terms of their Com|munion, yet received him into their Fel|lowship about <HI>Two years</HI> before he dy'd; Wherein he continued under a good Cha|racter, so long as he continued in the World.</P>

<P>There dwelt at a <HI>Village</HI> in this Coun|trey, one who dyed in <HI>December</HI> 1688. This man had been remarkable for his bad Life, till he had spent fifty years in the lewd and rude Courses of notorious Un|godliness. Though he had the Benefit
<PB N="10" REF="000539_0103_0FA6B5990CE11E80">
of a christian and pious <HI>Education,</HI> yet he had shaken off all the yokes which that had laid upon him. Hee became a foul|mouth'd <HI>Scoffer</HI> at all good men and good things; and a great mocker of <HI>Church|Members</HI> in particular. The Vices of <HI>Drunkenness</HI> and <HI>Swearing</HI> and <HI>Lying</HI> made the Characters of his Conversation. <HI>Sab|bath-Breaking</HI> and <HI>Promise-breaking,</HI> made him infamous among honest people, and his <HI>Disobedience</HI> to his Parents was not un|equal to the rest of his miscarriages. <HI>Ori|ginal Sin,</HI> in the furthest efforts of it, fill'd his whole man, and his whole way, for half an hundred years; at which age he left the world; and he had sat under &amp; sinn'd against the <HI>meanes of Grace</HI> all this while. But yet, which you will admire to hear! Yet this enormous liver was judg'd to be converted unto God some few weeks before he died, The great God so <HI>blessed</HI> &amp; <HI>owned</HI> the <HI>Ministry</HI> which he enjoy|ed, that the Efficacy of it on him, became conspicuous to Astonishment. He became a serious Paenitent, and so devout, so pen|sive, that every one saw a <HI>New-Creature</HI> in him. He mourned for all his former faults, and caused his Complaints to reach unto the <HI>Plague of his Heart</HI> as the Root

of all. He reformed what was amiss in him, and applyed himself with an exceed|ing Vigour to the Saviour, for the Salvati|on of his soul. While the <HI>Grace</HI> of God was thus beginning its Impressions on him, he fell <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ortally sick, and it was not long before he passed out of this world with a marvellous Assurance of his Interest in a better.</P>
<P>It were Endless to reckon up the extra|ordinary Expressions that fell from him, &amp; Behaviours that he had in the <HI>sick</HI> and <HI>last</HI> dayes of his life; but some of them were such as these.</P>
<Q><P>&mdash;O (<HI>said he</HI>) What a wonder of Mercy is it to my soul, that God hath not cast me immediately into Hell, and given me <HI>no Time</HI> to repent, or to beg for an Heart to Repent! But <HI>Great Mercy</HI> hath spared a <HI>great Sinner.</HI></P>
<P>&mdash;The stoutest man (<HI>said he</HI>) that ever lived, should he but seriously think on <HI>ETERNITY,</HI> and have no Christ to fly unto, it will so sink the the Heart of him, that he could never bear it; but the Lord will show Mercy to my distressed soul.</P></Q>
<P>He gave himself wholly to Prayer, and would excuse <HI>Watchers</HI> from sitting with
<PB N="12" REF="000539_0105_0FA6B59A98AE8EC8">
him, that he might be at leisure for Com|munion with God alone. Sometimes he would give a start as he lay, and being as|ked the Reason of it, he said, <HI>O I have a great work to do! and but a little time to do it!</HI></P>
<P>The conflicts which he endured in his Spirit were unutterable, under which, he day &amp; night kept <HI>wrestling with God</HI> for His Mercy. One morning his <HI>Brother</HI> en|quiring of him how he did, he replied, <Q>O I have had as doleful a night as ever man had, I have had three great enemies this night encountering with me; the <HI>World,</HI> the <HI>Flesh,</HI> &amp; the <HI>Devil.</HI> I have been this night, both in <HI>Hell</HI> &amp; in <HI>Heaven;</HI> and I can truly say with <HI>David,</HI> all this night long <HI>I have watered my couch with my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">,</HI> but as the day broke, my Saviour came &amp; vanquished the Devil, &amp; told him that he had no right in me, for He had Redeem|ed me with His own Blood.</Q></P>
<P>To his Father once he said, <Q>I have felt a great work on my distressed soul; <HI>This your son was lost and is found, was dead and is alive.</HI> Doleful nights have I seen; the Thoughts of my sins did sorely oppress me, when I would be crying to my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Saviour for His mercy, He would seem not to pitty me, but to say, <HI>Thou hast been

a servant of the Devil and of thy Lust, and dost thon now come to me? I have been call|ing to thee, and thou hast been hardening thy heart at my Calls, and dost thou expect mer|cy after all?</HI> And then the <HI>Devil</HI> would put in, saying, <HI>Thou hast been my Vassal so long, thy Cries for Mercy are now all too late.</HI> I have also seen the face of an <HI>An|gry God,</HI> and that is the most terrible thing that was ever seen. I then found no stay for my distressed soul, but <HI>Free-mercy! Free-mercy!</HI> The Lord now put under me His everlasting Arms, and gave me an heart still to pray &amp; say, <HI>Lord Jesus, Mer|cy for Thy own sake, Mercy for thy Name's sake!</HI> My Redeemer would say, <HI>Thou art a great sinner and an old sinner!</HI> The Answer of my soul was, <HI>Truth, Lord, but even such sinners have already found mer|cy at thy hands, I come to thee, for with thee the fatherless find mercy.</HI></Q></P>
<P>&mdash;He would break forth into very High Expressions; his great Comfort was fetch'd from that Promise in Mat. 11. 28. <HI>Come to Me&mdash;and I will give you rest.</HI> He would now cry out, <Q>O the Riches of <HI>Free-grace!</HI> There are thousands of thousands, &amp; ten thousand times ten thousand, in the third Heaven, rejoicing over a <HI>great</HI> and an <HI>old</HI> sinner coming to <HI>Glory!</HI> O glorify <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">

O that I could declare to my Relations and my Neighbours! yea that I could <HI>declare to</HI> Kings and Worlds <HI>what the Lord has done for my soul!</HI></Q>&mdash;He would reflect on the Humiliation of the Lord Jesus Christ, with an amazed &amp; a transported soul; he would break forth into a great Adoration of it, and say, <HI>O this wonderful mercy to undone sin|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">rs!</HI> He would also make that one of his Admirations, <HI>O the glorious work of faith, which doth role it self on Christ alone!</HI> [He bewailed it with a peculiar Bitterness, <HI>That he had been for the change of Government.</HI> But he said, he believed that God would restore to us, <HI>the judges as at the first, &amp; the counsel|lours as at the beginning, &amp; pastors according to His own heart.</HI> He was likewise much concerned about the <HI>Interest of Christ</HI> in the world; &amp; about the <HI>Success of the Prince of Orange,</HI> whose glorious Expedition we had then by the edges, a small notice of, he talk'd in strains that seem'd surprisingly <HI>prophetical.</HI>] His counsil to every one was, To <HI>make their Calling &amp; Election sure.</HI> And he would often say, <HI>O I am an old sinner &amp;

but a young Convert! I am fifty yeers old, and have lived but seven weeks all this while.</HI></P>
<P>To his Brethren he said, <Q>You are care|full about a <HI>Garment</HI> for me under my weakness this winter, but <HI>Brothers,</HI> I have a <HI>better</HI> Garment than you can provide for me; the long white Robe of the Righteousness of Jesus Christ, will cover me all over.</Q></P>
<P>He kept <HI>praying</HI> &amp; <HI>praising,</HI> &amp; <HI>singing psalms</HI> till his end came; and then being taken <HI>speechless</HI> &amp; <HI>senseless,</HI> his friends apprehend|ed they should hear him speak no more. Thus he lay for divers hours drawing on; but at length he just came to himself a|gain, and sprang up in his bed, spreading his arms abroad, as tho' going to leap into the Arms of a Redeemer, and Shouting, <HI>O my friends; Heaven rings all over at this! They wonder at this, a</HI> great <HI>and an</HI> old <HI>sinner coming to Heaven! Behold, in my father's house are many mansions; if it had not been so, my Saviour would not have said it; But He is gone to prepare a place for me, O the Riches of</HI> Grace! <HI>O glorifie</HI> Free-Grace <HI>for evermore!</HI> And so he went away to the <HI>Rest</HI> of God.</P>
