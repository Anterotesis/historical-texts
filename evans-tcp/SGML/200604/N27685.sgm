<P>SCARCELY had &s;ix revolving months a&s;&s;uaged our &s;orrows for the lo&s;s of our re|&s;pected SUMNER, when, obedient to the unani|mous de&s;ire of tho&s;e, whom your &s;uffrages have invited to offices of tru&s;t and re&s;pon&s;ibility, with public unaffected decorum, we clo&s;ed the mem|orable year which terminated the labors, anxie|ties and cares, of our beloved WASHINGTON.</P>
<P>WITH recent deep-felt &s;en&s;ibility, and the mo&s;t re&s;pectful tokens of filial reverence, we relin|qui&s;hed our &s;ecular concerns, to lament his &s;udden, eventful death; &s;ummoned by the ac|cu&s;tomed knell, the funereal dirge, and agon|izing peals from yonder celebrated eminence,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">WHERE the battle of <HI>June</HI> 17, 1775, was fought, and on which is a <HI>Monument,</HI> in memory of Gen.

with deliberate, &s;ilent foot&s;teps we trod the&s;e &s;acred courts. The &s;hrouded walls, the expre&s;|&s;ive harmony, the dejected a&s;pect of a crouded auditory, and the copious tears of female inno|cence were well adapted to the &s;olemn &s;cene.</P>
<P>HERE with mingled emotions of de&s;pondency, hope and re&s;ignation, we bowed in humble ador|ation to that ALL WISE, UNSEARCHABLE BEING</P>
<L>"Who views with equal eye as GOD of all,</L>
<L>"The Hero peri&s;h, or the Sparrow fall;"</L>
<P>here from a plaintive recital of the di&s;tingui&s;hed talents and &s;plendid achievements of an ancient <HI>Patriarch,</HI> we were led to contemplate the meekne&s;s, prudence, bravery, and zeal, of the VICTORIOUS LEADER in our American I&s;rael, who&s;e life and death were in&s;tructive le&s;&s;ons of pious patrioti&s;m; who&s;e PARENTAL LEGACY,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">SEE ADDRESS to the People of the United States, <HI>Sept.</HI> 17, 1796, by GEORGE WASHINGTON.</NOTE> bequeathed with prophetic reference to future generations, is an invaluable inheritance to his bereaved country.

The&s;e once plea&s;ing realities now pa&s;s before us "like the ba&s;ele&s;s fabric of a vi&s;ion," while conformably to the official call, of that EMINENT PATRIOT and STATESMAN, our VENE|RABLE ADAMS, on whom we tru&s;t the <HI>mantle</HI> has de&s;cended, we have entered this hallowed temple, "with one heart and one voice" to join united America, in our la&s;t public tribute of re&s;pect to his pre-eminent merit; and there is no &s;ituation in which I have ever appeared, &s;o deeply impre&s;&s;ed with the nece&s;&s;ity of your well known candor, as on this intere&s;ting occa&s;ion.</P>

<P>SELDOM is the morning of life devoted to the engagements of our riper years; with plea&s;ing expectation we enter the alluring thre&s;hold, re|gardle&s;s of the numerous intricate windings, which conduct us through the exten&s;ive edifice, unmindful of an inevitable, uncertain exit; but different was the ca&s;e before us; with a firm athletic con&s;titution, a capacious, vigorous mind, aided by the advantages of a &s;pecial in|&s;tructor, he was taught the u&s;eful arts and &s;ci|ences, for which, he was ever after, a di&s;tin|gui&s;hed advocate; and acquiring unu&s;ual habits of indu&s;try, method and per&s;everance, had &s;carcely arrived at manhood, when de&s;ignated by the government of his native province, for the execution of hazardous, important enter|prizes, where he di&s;covered that vigilance, mod|eration and punctuality, which have &s;ince ren|dered him the mo&s;t con&s;picuous character of the age, and excited the admiration of the world.</P>

Accu&s;tomed from early life to the toils of war; deeply intere&s;ted for the welfare of his bleeding country, with mode&s;t diffidence he accepted the command of her infant armies; amid the mo&s;t incredible difficulties and dangers, he led them triumphant, through the varied for|tunes of an eventful revolutionary period, to Peace and Independence; when with republican dignity, unequalled even by the celebrated Ro|man farmer, he relinqui&s;hed the &s;word for the pruning hook, and with genuine effu&s;ions of a patriotic &s;pirit to his military brethren,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">SEE his Farewell Addre&s;s to the Armies of the United States, Nov. 2, 1783.</NOTE> &s;urren|dered, to the VIRTUOUS ASSEMBLY, by which they were &s;o worthily be&s;towed, his exten&s;ive powers to participate <HI>under his own vine and fig tree,</HI> the ble&s;&s;ings of that freedom he had &s;o largely contributed to e&s;tabli&s;h.</P>

the humble avocations of the hu&s;bandman, &s;weet|ened by the allurements of dome&s;tic retirement, were courted with eager &s;olicitude; and his con|&s;tant refu&s;al of pecuniary reward, is the be&s;t evi|dence of &s;incere, di&s;intere&s;ted &s;ervices.</P>
<P>WE need not recur to the records of antiquity to e&s;tabli&s;h a belief, that patrioti&s;m or popular acquirements are not invariably connected with religion and morality; for it is a humiliating fact, that vice, with gigantic &s;trides, often boldly traver&s;es the &s;plendid palace, while tho&s;e milder virtues, which adorn humanity, are found in the pea&s;ant's cottage. Happy is that nation, where "examples move as precepts teach," great in|deed is the character, always influenced by that unerring guide, which looks beyond this chequer|ed life for approbation and reward; &s;uch is COLUMBIA'S BOAST, &s;uch was our DEPARTED FRIEND. From education, and habit, he was at|tached to the doctrines and ceremonies of the epi&s;|copal church, which did not, however, prevent a liberal regard to every other denomination.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">SEE his An&s;wers to the Addre&s;&s;es of the Clergy, on va|rious occa&s;ions.</NOTE> He con&s;idered public wor&s;hip as an indi&s;pen&s;a|ble duty, and was a &s;trict ob&s;erver of the chri&s;tian &s;abbath, whil&s;t his religion, equally free from bigotry or o&s;tentation, was the immoveable ba&s;is of his morality and beneficence.</P>
