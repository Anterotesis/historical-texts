<HEAD>AT A GENERAL COURT HELD AT BOSTON, April 29. 1668.</HEAD>
<P>WHereas <HI>Thomas Gold, William Turner,</HI> and <HI>John Farnham Senior,</HI> Obstinate and Turbulent <HI>Anabaptists:</HI> Have some time since Combined themselves with others in a pretended Church Estate&punc; without the knowledge or approbation of the Authority here Established, at the Law requires, to the great griefe and offence of the godly Orthodox; some of themselves being persons Excommunicated from the Churches to which they formerly belonging; have also Constituted among themselves, Officer or Officers, to carry on all Administrations in their pretended Church Society, Contrary also to the Law in that case provided <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> that such Officers should be Able, Pious and Orthodox: For which irregularities they have been Convented before severall Courts, and about two years since were enjoyned by this Court to desist from the said practice, and to return to our allowed Church-Assemblies, which they have not in the least attended.</P>
<P>The Councill in <HI>March</HI> last, desirous (after long forbearance) to use the utmost meanes to convince and reduce them&punc; intreated the assistance of divers Elders, who in the meeting house at <HI>Boston</HI> did publickly endeavour the same, this Court considering with how great Pertenacy and presumption the said <HI>Thomas Gold</HI> and company had continued their Scismattical assembling to|gether, the Order of this Court notwithstanding, judged it necessary to Con|vent the said <HI>Thomas Gold, William Turner</HI> and <HI>John Farnham Senior,</HI> before them, that from themselves the Court might understand what Effect the endeavours of the said Elders had taken with them: where the said persons did in open Court assert their former practice to have been according to the mind of God, and that nothing that they had heard convinced them to the contrary; which practice, being also otherwise circumstanced, with makeing Infant Baptisme a Nullity, and thereby makeing us all to be unbaptized per|sons, and so consequently no Regular Churches, Ministry or Ordinances and also renouncing all our Churches as being so bad and corrupt, that they are not fit to be held Communion with, denying to submit to the Government of Christ in the Church, and entertaining of those that are under Church Censure,
<PB REF="000124_0009_0FA029FD30021D88">
thereby making the discipline of Christ in his Churches to be of none effect, and manifestly tending to the disturbance and distruction of these Churches; the which practise of theirs upon examination before the Court they profess themselves still resolved to adhere unto: all which to allow, would be the setting up a free-scool for seduction into wayes of Error, and casting off the Government of Christ Jesus in his own ap|pointments, with a high hand, and opening a door for all sorts of a|bominations to come in among us, to the disturbance not only of our Ec|clesiastical enjoyments, but also contempt of our Civil Order, and the Au|thority here established, doth manifestly threaten the dissolution and ruine, both of the peace and order of the Churches and the Authority of this Government: which our duty to God and the Country doth oblige us to prevent, by using the most compassionate effectual means to attain the same; all which considering, together with the danger of disseminating their errors and incouraging presumptuous irregularities, by their example should they continue in this Jurisdiction, this Court doth judge it necessary that they be removed to some other part of this Country or else where: And accordingly doth order that the said <HI>Thomas Gold, William Turner,</HI> and <HI>John Farnham</HI> senior; do before the twentieth of <HI>July</HI> next remove themselves out of this Jurisdiction, and that if after the the twentieth of <HI>July,</HI> the said <HI>Thomas Gold, William Turner,</HI> and <HI>John Farnham</HI> senior, or either of them be found in any part of this Jurisdiction, without License first had and ob|tained from this Court or the Council, he or they shall forthwith be appre|hended and committed to prison, by warrant from any Magistrate; there to remain without baile or main prize until be or they shall give sufficient secu|rity to the Governour or any Magistrate, immediately to depart the Jurisdi|ction and not to return as abovesaid: And all Constables and other Officers are required to be faithful and diligent in the execution of this Sentence And it is further Ordered that the keepers of all prisons whereto the said <HI>Thomas Gold, William Turner</HI> and <HI>John Farnham</HI> senior, or any of them shall be Committed, shall not permit any resort of company of more then two at one time, to any of the said persons. And although we might expect that our indulgence till the <HI>twentieth of July,</HI> might prevaile with them to refraine their offencive practices, during the time permitted them to continue amongst us, yet our experience of their high Obstinate and Presumptious carriages doth gage us to prohibit them any further meeting together on the Lords-day, or upon any other dayes, upon pretence of their Church estate or for the ad|ministration or exercises of any pretended Ecclesiastical function as dispen|sation of the Seals or preaching; wherein if they shall be taken offending they shall be imprisoned till the tenth of <HI>Iuly</HI> next and then left at their li|berty, within ten dayes to depart the Jurisdiction upon penalty as abovesaid.</P>
